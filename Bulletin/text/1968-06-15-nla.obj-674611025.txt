one customer we can't get
This English Water Spider makes a net, takes it
below the water's surface and fills it with air.
Without ClG's oxygen-making equipment,
she manages to live, breathe and breed under
water in comfort.
Our customers, however, prefer the convenience
of CIG oxygen, or many of our other gases in
use today for industrial and medical purposes.
There's acetylene, hydrogen, nitrogen, propane,
argon, nitrous oxide, cyclopropane and the
"rare gases" krypton, xenon, neon and helium.
We produce and supply Australia's needs
and still have enough left over to export.
Unlimited quantities of CIC. oxygen are available
as compressed gas in cylinders, as liquid in
tanks and direct by pipeline in gaseous form
from plant to site. Metalworking processes require
our acetylene, too, to produce one of the hottest
flames known to man, 6000° F.
The main source for many of our gases is the
atmosphere. Over the past 57 years we've plucked
millions of tons out of thin air. But don't worry.
There's plenty left and nature's topping it up all
the time. For us, you, and the water spider.

ILL WINDS
THINGS look sunny in the snow
country. After the exceptionally long,
mild autumn along the eastern coast,
winter has come hard and sharp.
Already there is more snow than there
was for the whole of last winter. People
were hurrying to the snow before last
weekend, the official start of the season,
and on occasion had to put up with
inadequate staff because many people
were still working at their summer jobs.
Bookings are already strong for 1969.
Meanwhile, back in the cities the
shops are slowly recovering from the
long, hot summer. According to Mr.
J. B. Griffin, secretary of the Retail
Traders’ Association of N.S.W., the
warm weather into May had a
“dramatic effect on retail trade. Until
mid-May the fashion industry was in
a very sorry situation,” he said. “Two
quite large suppliers went out of busi-
ness.” 1
Things picked up with the first cold
spells and were now, according to Mr.
Griffin, “running at an extremely good
level. Everyone,” he said, “is now
talking about the performance of their
electric blanket.” Food had also had
a bit of a boost with the cold weather
— “people always eat more in winter.”
However, goods moving in the shops
at last might not do much to help the
smaller manufacturer. One maker of
teenage clothes admitted to a surplus
of 2000 winter garments still in their
stockroom. The position with manu-
facturers would roughly be that between
the end of March and early May they
did not get any repeat winter orders
from the shops and they were not getting
enough summer orders in to keep the
staff going. Some of them got going very
early on next summer’s stock and this
is already on its way to the shops.
However, once summer stock begins
to arrive in the shops, and it is arriving
now, the pressure is on to clear winter
stocks with large-scale sales.
Going one step farther back to the
fabric manufacturer, it is hard to
estimate the effect of abnormal weather
on him. Most of the big woollen manu-
facturers have large Army orders. And,
in any case, when the garment manu-
facturer realises he is facing an abnormal
season, he has long since paid his fabric
supplier.
BATTLING BOOKS
“FAR WORSE than French novels,”
said a frowning Dr. Andrew Fabinyi,
just returned from the sixth conference
of Indonesian publishers in East Java.
He was talking about the quality of
Indonesian book production. “They
haven’t even enough paper to print a
minimum of educational books. Import
restrictions and lack of foreign exchange
represent a virtual embargo on much-
needed American and English text-
books.”
Dr. Fabinyi, of Cheshires, represented
the Australian Publishers’ Association at
the conference.
If Indonesian publishers face serious
practical problems there seems to be no
lack of enthusiasm. Two hundred pub-
lishers braved the hazards of the coun-
try’s transport system to attend the ten-
day conference at Trepes, near Sura-
Dr. Andrew Fabinyi with Mrs. Sumitro,
Vice-President of the Indonesian
Publishers’ Association, at the recent
publishers’ conference in East Java
baja. “I couldn’t say that the publishers
all support the Suharto regime, but it
was very clear that they have all woken
from the nightmare of the Sukarno
years.”
As the only non-Asian at the con-
ference, Dr. Fabinyi said the Indonesian
publishers were far more involved in
national controversies than their Aus-
tralian counterparts. “Whatever prob-
lems beset Indonesia today and there
are many were mirrored in the con-
ference. The election of the new board
was a very tense occasion, particularly
reflecting the divisions of regionalism.
“Surabaja,” Dr. Fabinyi said, “cer-
tainly took the occasion very seriously.
The streets were decorated with banners
which had large slogans across them
like ‘The book is the most patient
teacher.’ I often found memo papers,
too, with messages such as ‘With books
we achieve the victory of the new
order.’ ”
The practical results of his trip? Dr.
Fabinyi, now with, as he said, “more
knowledge about Indonesian book pub-
lishing than anyone outside Indonesia,”
is planning to bring a group of Indo-
nesian publishers to Australia to gain
pointers from our industry.
POLISHING THE LENS
FOLLOWING his famous Senate
speech in praise of philistinism, John
Gorton has been considered an unlikely
patron for the Arts Council founded by
Harold Holt. However, rumors are
sweeping the film industry that the
Prime Minister is about to announce
further important decisions. These
may include the establishment of a
reconstituted National Film Board pat-
terned on the much admired Canadian
model. And there’s also hope of direct
financial assistance for feature-film pro-
duction. An announcement is expected
within a few weeks.
THE UBIQUITOUS AD-MAN
“SELECTIVE indignation” might be-
come a fashionable phrase, but not with
those to whom all villains are white
and generally, American. The Roman
Catholic Archbishop of Westminster,
Cardinal Heenan, coined it last week.
“Think how many marches and demon-
strations have taken place against the
Americans in Vietnam, but how many
marches and demonstrations have there
been against the massacre in Biafra?”
Attacking the British Government’s
supply of arms to Federal Nigerian
forces fighting' breakaway Biafra,
Cardinal Heenan quoted the neutral
President of the Ivory Coast, who re-
cently said that more people had been
killed in the past ten months of the
Biafran war than in three years in
Vietnam.
However, certain help has been forth-

coming for the Biafrari Government
from a totally unexpected source, an
advertising agency. From our reading of
London papers, we learn that in Janu-
ary the Geneva-based H. Wm. Bern-
hardt agency took the Biafran Govern-
ment as a client and since then has
been telling the world what is happen-
ing there.
They have been telexing messages,
via Lisbon, from their own men in
Bjafra and flying in reporters and pho-
tographers. when space can be found in
planes. The agency now has ten people
working on the account. “We’ve hardly
talked about money,” said an agency
spokesman. “What we’ll make out of it
eventually I honestly don’t know.
Strictly speaking what we put out is
propaganda. It’s pro-Biafran, but it’s
factual. What we really want is to be
able to close the account. Not because
we don’t want Biafi'ans as clients. But
because it will mean peace.”
The agency is bringing hope to the
Biafrans, and probably new inspiration
to ad men who have never had to face
a more dangerous enemy than suds
clog in the washing-machine.
PRIVATE WARRIOR
GRACE COSSINGTON SMITH was
an unlikely revolutionary. She is one
of three painters credited with the
establishment of the modernist move-
ment in Australia in the ’twenties, but
her part in the battle was conducted
quietly and steadily, far from the stir-
rings of her contemporaries.
Now in her seventies, she has just
held a retrospective exhibtion of 43 of
her paintings at Sydney’s Macquarie
Galleries—an exhibition which spanned
the years between 1925 and 1966.
Except for two brief trips to Eng-
land and Europe, she has lived those
years in the same house in Sydney’s
North Shore, where she grew up. “My
sisters went to England,” she says a
little regretfully, “I stayed here and
struggled with my painting.”
The world expressed in her paintings,
like the world expressed in Jane Austen’s
work, is a small one — the furniture in
her house, the bushland around Sydney.
But, in the 1920s, the way she saw these
things was considered unacceptable by
the Australian art establishment.
She recalls the fact that her pic-
ture of the unfinished Sydney Harbor
Bridge was thi'own out of an exhibiton
by the Society of Artists, although it is
in the Melbourne Gallery’s collection
today — something she is understand-
ably pleased about.
“No, I didn’t feel like giving up
when my paintings were rejected. It was
discouraging, of course — but not dis-
couraging enough to stop me painting.”
So she continued to work in the
studio her father had built for her in
the garden of their home in Turra-
murra, and in 1928, she had her first
exhibition at the Grosvenor Galleries.
“There were a few people ready to
give young painters a chance to exhibit,
but it wasn’t until Thea Proctor founded
the Contemporary Art Society that we
had a real opening.”
Miss Smith was a child when she
decided she wanted to be a painter, but
she says her art master, Dattilo-Rubbo,
was responsible for her inclination to-
ward post-impressionism. “Nobody else
talked about it at all, but he had a
large studio in Rowe Street, and we’d
sit at a long table while he read to us
about Van Gogh and Cezanne. I was
very lucky in going to him. He just
seemed to be talking about the way I
wanted to paint.”
In 1912, she went to Europe with her
sister. She was 18, and young ladies
didn’t “go about” very much, so she
saw few paintings and met no artists,
but in Germany, she took some lessons
in landscape painting. Back in Austra-
lia she returned to Dattilo-Rubbo,
with whom she studied for eight years,
and except for another trip to England
in 1948, she has “painted quietly in
Turramurra” ever since.
“I didn’t talk very much with other
artists, because it can only help a little
bit. In the end it all depends on your
own painting — I’ve never tried to be
an ‘ism,’ because I don’t think you can
succeed that way. I’ve just painted as I
felt.”
Her. paintings have changed gradu-
ally over the years, the light in them
becoming more fragmented, but the
changes, she says, have not been con-
sciously wrought. The exhibition has
been held because bad eyesight pre-
vents her from painting now', “and I
thought it was time I sorted out my
work.” The collection is necessarily in-
complete, since some of her best paint-
ings are in galleries, museums, and pri-
vate collections — a fitting tribute to
Miss Smith and her early private war
on behalf of progress.
WRONG NUMBERS
FOR A WFIILE it looked as if the
vandals were winning their long-run-
ning battle with the PMG and that
public phones would become a thing
of the past, or, at least, an occasional
luxury, as they are in some parts of
Europe. But although the Post Office
is down to the extent of about $2 mil-
lion a year for repairs to smashed
phone booths and instruments, it has
no intention of quitting.
The department this year will add
another 350 to the 29,000 public phones
in this country and has plans to make
telephones harder to put out of action
and culprits easier to catch. It is a
massive operation. In Victoria, tech-
nicians make about 700 calls a day.
In New South Wales there are 33 men
on surveillance work and a fleet of
radio-controlled cars working around
the clock.
The senseless destruction which goes
on and on —often a repaired booth is
knocked down again within 24 hours
-—is forcing PMG engineers to new in-
genuities. As well as developing their
own security devices, they get help

to make cars safer for you.
GMH have made big strides in car safety over the years. But one advance
stands out from the rest. The Energy Absorbing Steering Column.
Within its design lies unique driver protection the ability to compress at a
controlled rate under heavy impact, thereby greatly reducing the risk of injury.
GMH cars have this, and other advanced safety features, because engineers
had the foresight to know they were necessary to prove they were possible.
Tomorrow their foresight will make new breakthroughs.
And GMH will build even safer, better cars.

WHY ARE OLD
PERSIAN RUGS SO
SUCCESSFUL IN
MODERN INTERIORS?
Architects are among our most
enthusiastic customers for old rugs.
Because these rugs are one of the
few art forms still hand-made of
natural materials by peasants and
nomads, they are particularly suitable
for modern homes with their emphasis
on natural materials. Architects
appreciate the way these rugs actu-
ally improve in appearance with age
as colours mellow and the marks of
use add character. They know that
they will always have a validity
regardless of -changing styles and
have discovered that in their variety
they are not only a superb foil to
the clean lines of modern architecture,
they add the human element so often
lacking in the interiors of today.
We stock only those rugs still pro-
duced under the authentic conditions
and we try as far as possible to select
pieces of genuine artistic merit
whether the rug costs $BO or $4OOO.
We certify every piece we sell.

from safe and security manufacturers
to keep up with new developments.
They are having considerable success
with a device which connects all the
phones in an area with alarm systems
in the exchange. In one case this
helped catch five vandals in as many
months.
When we talked to the assistant
director of telecommunications in New
South Wales, Mr. J. A. Scanlan, he had
just finished signing recommendations
for prosecution of schoolboys caught
wrecking phone booths. “We average
six a week,” he said. The department
knows that vandals work hardest in
summer, in quiet suburban areas, new
housing developments, and beach resorts.
Most are between 11 and 20 years of
age and are unable to give a reasonable
explanation of their actions. If they have
a story at all, it is that they wanted the
money.
Prosecution of vandals leads to
sentences from six months on a bond
for juvenile offenders, to three months’
jail for adults convicted of offences in-
volving theft.
But dishonesty doesn’t stop with
PMG property. The other day we
heard of an unthinking rogue who
souvenired a coin-operated red phone
—probably from some unattended hotel
bottle department—and connected it up
in his own home. If he thinks he
is getting free phone calls for life he
is mistaken. Unless he can force open
the coin box to retrieve his five-cent
pieces—no mean feat, according to the
Victa people, who operate them—he
will feed them in until it can take no
more and, in any case, in November
the PMG will read his meter and send
him an account.

IT'S HARDER THAN EVER
TO JUDGE A BOOK
BY ITS COVER
AT THE opening night of the Mel-
bourne film festival, the president, Dr.
Philip Law, announced the presence of
the Victorian Chief Secretary, Mr.
Rylah. It is bad to have to report it,
but that respectable audience of 3000
hissed. It was said to be a protest against
the Government’s censorship laws. Mr.
Rylah commented in the “Sun”: “I
couldn’t have cared less about the hiss-
ing myself. I’m a politician, and poli-
ticians grow to expect these things. But
I was terribly embarrassed for my wife,
particularly since it was so unfair.”
Actually, apart from films at the
festival, the latest controversy has been
over dangerous books being read at
school. This year among the books set
for Leaving were “Catcher in the Rye,”
by J. D. Salinger, and “The Fringe
Dwellers,” by Nene Gare. The Aspen-
dale Technical School set them for the
Intermediate class, and a mother com-
plained to Mr. Rylah. Mr. David, head-
master at Aspendale, said his teachers
did not think there was anything objec-
tionable in the books, nevertheless the
Education Department withdrew them
from the school.
Your correspondent has been looking
into this matter. Nene Gare is the wife
of the Commissioner for Native Welfare
in Western Australia, and “The Fringe
Dwellers” is about two young and
beautiful part-Aboriginal sisters. The
blurb on the back cover reads: “. . . the
brawling squalor of the camp, the neat
ghetto of the reserve, a bottle of conto
and quick love in the sandhills.”
Now this is the whole basis of the
trouble, you see. People have been read-
ing the blurb and they have been horri-
fied. Frankly, as an elderly pervert, I
have always been devoted to blurbs.
Blurbs actually save one having to read
the book. After many years of experience
I have discovered that books rarely
live up to the gutsy promise of the rich,
eloquent blurb. It is the same with wine
labels. Wine-makers, these times, are so
eloquent, they put so much beautiful
information on the label, no longer is it
necessary to drink the wine.
Could one offer a selection of my
latest, more-satisfying blurb reading.
“Where Love Has Gone,” by Harold
Robbins: “A family’s morals are laid
bare. Nora, a brilliant artist who
believed her only responsibility was
to her ever-demanding body. And Dick,
a gigolo passionately loved by both
mother and daughter.” Now that is a
superb blurb, but you don’t read the
book, because you realise that if
Nora’s body is really ever demanding,
Nick has little hope of coping with
mother and daughter at the same time.
Then “Cleopatra,” by Douglas Reay:
“Convention insists that she was an
over-sexed seductress, but in fact she
was a shrewd, intelligent woman.” The
book curiously enough had been
dumped on the 20-cent table, and no
doubt the blurb was at fault. The
publisher should never have put in
that bit about Cleopatra being a shrewd,
intelligent woman.
Iris Murdoch blurbs are marvellous
you really get everything at once.
Take “A Severed Head”: “With its
sombre and often symbolic handling
of adultery, incest, castration, sexual
confusion, violence, and suicide, ‘A
Severed Head’ seems at times as
macabre as Jacobean tragedy, at times
as frivolous as Restoration comedy.”
And the most interesting line out of
“The Bell” blurb ... “A story of
well-meaning perverts.” I mean per-
verts like people to know that they are
well-meaning.
But the best blurb I had all the
week was this one for “The Girl on
a Motor Cycle,” by Andre Pieyre De
Mandiargues: “The girl on the motor
cycle is a young married woman and
this is her erotic day-dream as she

CHARACTERISTICS
OF THE
RIESLING GRAPE
Often referred to as Rhine
Riesling to distinguish it
from Semilion and other
varieties. A small round
greenish-yellow grape turning
to gold on the sunny side.
Moderate yield, ripens early,
soft and juicy with a tough,
translucent skin. The leaf is
medium size and round with
blunt teeth and three lobes,
rarely five. Rhine Riesling
' is distinctive in having
small, tight, cylindrical
bunches with short stalks
and spotted grapes. Usually
winged or shouldered and held
tightly to the cane.
Yalumba Carte d’Or is a true-to-
type delicate dry white produced
from selected Rhine Riesling
grapes grown on the gentle slopes
of the Angaston, Eden Valley and
Springton districts of the
Barossa Valley. Bottled early in
the vintage year, usually August/
September, then allowed to mellow
in the century-old cellars of
Yalumba. A consistent prize ,
winner which, we feel sure, will
have winning ways with you'
and your friends.

rides to meet her lover, zipped up
naked in a black leather suit. Sexual
fantasy and practice raised in cold,
clinical prose . . . tantalising sensuous-
ness in juxtaposing of the countryside
through which she rides to her affairs
and the manipulations of the motor
cycle.” The manipulation of that motor
cycle has me mad with excitement.
Film blurbs on the other hand
should be savored for their sheer
punchiness. “Blow Up” “Abandon
that almost shakes the film off its
sprockets.” “Night Games” “A
macabre thriller where adults play
strange games of temptation and pass
on the most terrifying game of
all.” And “My Sister With Love”
“Difficult subject of incestuous love is
handled with a sensitive touch.” There
are the perverts getting a break again.
The interesting point is this. The
eloquent blurb undoubtedly was the real
success of the opera this year. Here are
some direct quotes from the Elizabethan
Trust folder:
“Tosca”: “Puccini’s spine-chilling
drama plunges at headlong speed toward
destruction. A sinister police chief
hungers lustfully for the love of Tosca.”
“Tannhauser”: “The Knight Tann-
hauser, torn by two conflicting passions,
must choose between the gentle love of
a demure princess and the voluptuous
lures of Venus herself.”
“Don Carlos”: “Against a blazing
background of heretics’ funeral pyres
. . . Verdi has created one of the grand-
est of all grand operas. His composer’s
soul explodes with musical passion to
unfold a suspense-paoked saga of con-
flict man against son for the love
of the same woman.”
“The Girl of the Golden West”:
“Puccini’s gun-toting Californian gold-
rush opera can boast 24-carat passion,
conflict, and cunning.”
The Trust has done well. Now I
wonder if we could not give a little help
to some of our more-cherished classics.
“Hansel and Gretel”: “Realistic,
tough, ruthless the far-out, appalling
novel of vicious sadism, witchcraft, and
cannibalism set in the gloom of the
forest of Germany. A raw, elemental
story of two young people abandoned to
their own resources. Almost shakes print
off the type.”
“The Sentimental Bloke,” by C. J.
Dennis: “Bill, two-up gambler, alcoholic,
a raw, desperate juvenile delinquent
who has already been inside . . . Doreen,
softly beautiful, flower-like, worked in
a pickle factory . . . gritty with reality,
lusty with life, the story of an ex-con’s
struggle to go straight and find his
‘ideel bit o’skirt.’ ”
Then, if “Romeo and Juliet” has been
set for Leaving or Matriculation this
year I think I could save them reading
it with this blurb: “Romeo played at
passion, but delicious, slinky Juliet
played for keeps. Searing, uninhibited
story of under-legal-age, suppressed
teenage desires played out in downtown
Verona. Ferocious parental rivalries,
death, and love.”

Daphne Guinness
A 260-MILE DASH
TO DO A SPOT OF
SHOPPING FOR H.R.H.
THE THING IS, every little helps.
While everybody knows Double Bay is
the chic-est shopping place in the
whole of New South Wales, it does go
down well to learn that Mrs. Sinclair
Hill came 240 miles from Quirindi to
buy curtains and things for the Duke
of Edinburgh’s weekend there. You
know, isn’t it wonderful that, indirectly,
11.R.H. has had some connection with
the place? There are actually some
shopowners saying from now on they’re
only interested in selling to the Polo
Set. And even though it’s hell living
there, what with the parking and damp
and everything, and sometimes the
smell off the beach is awful, the people
who do say it’s a fun-place and worth
every penny. Saturday mornings
especially. Everyone’s kissing everyone
as though they’ve not met for years and
admiring their leisure gear, which is
totally different from that worn Mon-
day to Friday. And drinking fluffy
coffee and saying meet you at the Ritz
in London. Ecstasy. Everyone’s going
to England.
By the time they return and, pro-
vided, as H.R.H. would say, people
have pulled their fingers out, the Satur-
day set will find their territory ex-
tended. All the way down Cross
Street. And by next year it’ll go still
further till it’s nearly in the sea. At
the moment, there’s a division in Cross
Street. One end fearfully haute, the
other well, the expression tizzy
brothel has been suggested. Anyway,
next week Bay Village is to have what
the designers call a tasteful open-
ing: that is, no rockets or helicopter
gimmicks or anything like that. Cer-
tainly not. No, there will be the Mayor
of Woollahra, Alderman Crouch, fol-
lowed by chicken sandwiches.
Right now, estate agent Dick Whit-
tington sits in his office beneath a
portrait of Sir Winston Churchill,
marked For Sale, and says, yes, this
is what he calls bonanza-time. You
know, over the road where it’s
scheduled commercial, people are
turning down offers of $40,000 for mere
bungalows. And a garage site $120,000.
Fantastic. Actually, not so fantastic
when Sidney Londish, who’s built the
new Bay Village, paid $150,000 for a
90ft. frontage. Yeah, well, Mr. Whit-
tington hitches his white socks and
says perhaps he ought not to guess how
much the whole project cost. It
couldn’t, however, sell for less than
$650,000.
Anyway, up at Bay Village there
are 29 two-storey shops built round
a courtyard and a Pagoda Thai
Temple influence, murmurs Mr. Whit-
tington lyrically taking up
10,500 sq. ft., and in Shop 11, which
will be a restaurant if they can pass
their plumbing through, interior
decorator Leslie Walford is asking why
does everyone assume Australian ladies
have diarrhoea? You know, do the
lavatories have to be so close to the
eating area? Well, it’s very funny,
says someone, they do flit in and out
more than any other nation in the
world.
Upstairs, Jyotikana Ray, cousin of
Satyajit Ray, the Indian film director,
is having a shampoo and set at
Corinne’s, ready for her handicraft
opening tonight by the indefatigable
Mayor of Woollahra. Corinne is seated
behind a nylon curtain having a perm,
she knew she shouldn’t have, and re-
vealing staggering facts about life as a
coiffeur. There are three hairdressers in
the Village. “One is normal, everyday,”
says Mr. Whittington, “one is comb-ups
with kinky rabbit-hutch wire decor, and
the other, Corinne, all sophisticated, you
know, matching towels and things.” A
man from Sportsdeck, which sells in-
gear to men who Cruise and Resort, is
in the coffee shop complaining he’s
cold. Aw, hell, he doesn’t want to talk,
he just wants to make money. Fantastic
clothes, says Mr. Whittington. In
Galeries Francaises, known as Carving
Craft at Kings Cross, Anthony Pine is
saying everyone’s buying reproductions
these days, where else could they get
Louis XV antiques? P’raps if they were
de Gaulle . . . Actually, he wishes their
taste would develop to Louis XVI, but
it takes time. Anyway, half of Bellevue
Hill are reproduction mad, and a bit of
Bondi, too.
At Cross Street’s other end, haute
milliner Flenriette La Motte is build-
ing next to haute coiffeur Alexander.
She was to be Ye Olde Englishe, but
is now Very Modern French with a
little dash of Louis XV oh, the real
thing. Max Herford, the local news-
agent, who owns this block, wants to
call it Herford House Annexe, and
everyone’s trying to persuade him not
to. You know, does the guy want to
build a monument to himself, or sump’n?
And along the road in Hunter’s Arcade,
Irishman Norman Burridge wonders if
he’s mad swopping horse-selling, the
Charlie Clore/Aly Khan class, for Irish
clothes. His haute boutiques are sliced
up the middle by a haute dry cleaner
with grotty decor. He’s gonna buy two
giant bay trees so he can’t see it. Also,
rumor has it that Rocher is bringing
her haute couture to Double Bay.
Actually, the only person who is not
utterly convinced that this is the chic-
est shopping place in the whole of New
South Wales is Harry Miller’s newest
client, Mrs. Zara Holt. She and shop
Magg are getting out.

America —the end of
the age of the gun?
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
IT IS easy enough to lecture the
Americans that they should not shoot
their political leaders. Almost all Ameri-
cans would at once agree. But what can
be done about it? It is not much use
making some general statement such as
that American society should 'be changed
so that assassins cease to exist. Even if
such a general statement, despite its
vagueness, were useful as a long-term
prospect, what situation does it leave
for political leaders over the interim
period? You can’t switch societies on
and off like electric light. What’s going
to happen in the meantime? Who’ll be
next?
At least for a while the answer would
seem to be the regrettable one that the
more controversial leaders in America
are going to have to live with some of
the fear and circumspection that in
modern society has previously been
reserved only for tyrants, although fear
of assassination was a universal charac-
teristic of leadership in most societies
before the modern period. Short of
Stalin-type security precautions, their
safety cannot finally be guaranteed, but
they will have to put up with body-
guards and they will have to control
their public appearances most carefully.
(How a traditional election can be
fought in such circumstances is hard to
imagine.) In the manner of brave men,
individual leaders may be careless of
their own lives, but the matter is too
important to be kept to their own self-
regard. Each assassin’s bullet falls not
only into the body of some great Ameri-
can: it also pierces the fabric of Ameri-
can democracy.
To wonder why it is that Americans
shoot their famous men more readily
than other democracies, it is better to
begin with a narrow perspective than a
broad one. If America is looked at from
this viewpoint first, the obvious answer
is that it is a society in which to many
people the fantasy hero was the kid with
the gun. In the American imagination
the pistol played some of the role that
the barricade, for example, played in
the French imagination and that the
sword played in the Japanese imagina-
tion. The gun is the symbol of a virile
heroism. To shoot it out is the clean
way of settling matters between good
and bad.
Although the spacegun now replaces
the cowboy’s six-shooter in our child-
ren’s garnes, there are countries all over
the world that share this part of the
American dream-. To treat killing as
play is part of the general human fan-
tasy. But other societies have not insti-
tutionalised the gun as seriously as the
Americans did. In ordinary life in most
other countries, the gun is reserved for
killing animals: as an instrument of
death for humans it is just an instru-
ment like any other, not something in
itself. Even American soldiers, for whom
the romance of death soon departs,
nevertheless tote their weapons with the
innocent pleasure of cowboys. Back
home, pistol-packing is a weekend hobby
for suburban households. Lethal weapons
can be bought in America almost as if
they were children’s toys.
Surely this is one matter on which
Congress must take action in defiance
of the gun lobby. To control the sale of
small arms is finally impossible. But to
set up stringent and retrospective limi-
tations on the possession of certain
kinds of firearms, with heavy penalties,
could mark the necessary beginning of
the long and difficult task of reminding
Americans that guns are not just play-
things, but vehicles of disaster. Tough
legislation (even if it was at first bound
to fail) would be useful propaganda: it
would be a way of dramatising the
realities of gun-worship to those who
should now learn that lesson.
Just as important, but even more
difficult, is the question of the mass
entertainment industries. It seems likely
that the depiction of violence does a
great deal more good than harm.
Among other things, humans are of
violent disposition. Horror is part of our
bodies, with instructions for its develop-
ment written into our genes. And the
release of horror in fantasy may be one
of those ways in which many of us clear
ourselves of our animal heritage so that
we can go on being human. But this
does not mean that entertainment must
for ever glorify the gun itself as a
human symbol.
To remove gun-worship from Ameri-
can society is not something that can be
done overnight by Acts of Congress or
by making a few speeches. But to
Americans another part of whose
dream is that they should do good it
is not an impossible task that they
should try to change their condition. If
gun-worship began to disappear, this
would not prevent altogether the pos-
sibility of assassinations: but it would
probably reduce it. Guns are more
likely to be used in a society in which
the gun is glorified than in a society
in which it is not. And, in any case,
an American society that was more in-
clined to see the gun for what it is
would be a better society. Already to a
very large extent Americans have got
out of their gun fantasy. The latest
surveys suggest that only a quarter of

them still see the gun as an important
symbol. But a quarter is too many.
One can read too much into political
shootings in America. That they have
happened is not a general damnation of
America but a particular damnation of
a particular aspect of America. Complex
societies cannot be described simply in
terms of some particular sensational
occasion. In the same way, one does not
learn all about France by considering
the student riots and the union strikes.
These were particular manifestations of
particular characteristics of France: but
they did not tell you all about France.
They did not, for instance, tell you that
France is a predominantly bourgeois
country, pragmatic rather than heroic:
nor did they tell you that, after America
and Japan, French business is probably
building up the best management in the
world.
The enemies of America will seize
on its political shootings as symbols of
anything in America that arouses their
hatred, their fear, or their envy. In this
we should keep our heads. It is not as a
result of American affluence or Ameri-
can liberalism that these shootings have
happened. They are not symptoms of the
collapse of American society: they are
threats to that society. They belong to a
tradition of American society that has
always been a threat to its stability.
Like any other society, America is
diverse: it is not all of one piece.
There is one way, however, in which
the shooting of leaders is connected
with a characteristic of American
society that is not part of the tradition
of gun-toting, but can nevertheless cause
gun-toters to use their guns. This
characteristic is that American society
can change. There is always a violence
in change; it is not necessarily the
violence of assassination, or even the
violence of disorder, but it is necessarily
the violence of affronted wisdom.
Change means that one set of values is
upset by another set of values, and
there can often be no greater violence
offered to a human being than that he
should be asked to change his mind. If
he is asked to change his mind in a
gun-toting society, he might use his gun.
British liberalism (unlike British
radicalism, now dead) has traditionally
preferred order to change. It has pre-
ferred to maintain the liberties of the
privileged rather than risk their loss in
a disorderly extension of liberty in which
it is feared that all liberty might dis-
solve. In America, although liberty is
underpinned by order and predictability,
there is also a continuing tradition of
radicalism to which the risks of change
can be part of their inducement. America
is now going through one of its radical
stages, but America is not necessarily to
be despised because it is changing. If
the spirit of change continues in
America, there is bound to be more
violence: all we can hope is that it will
be the violence of protest, not the
violence of looting and murder.

AUSTRALIA
Skimming the cream off
the farmers’ subsidies
THERE ARE CLEAR signs that the
Federal Government, surprisingly with
Country Party agreement, is about to
begin to shift some of the feathers out
of the farmers’ subsidised featherbeds.
Beginning with a decision, as yet un-
announced, to alter procedure for
wheat subsidisation, Cabinet is plan-
ning further moves affecting subsidies
for dairying, sugar production, and
cotton.
Snippets of information on the future
of the Wheat Stabilisation Scheme have
appeared in the rural and financial Press
but The Bulletin is in a position to
spell out the details. Under his new
scheme the Commonwealth Government
proposes that the subsidisation of ex-
ported wheat will virtually cease after
the 1969 crop.
It proposes to maintain a high home
consumption price so that Australian
consumers will continue to pay more
than the international price. For the
€0 million bushels or so of wheat which
is consumed in Australia, a price of
$1.70 will be set (compared to $1.61
at present). But the guaranteed price
for exported wheat will be reduced
radically to what is likely to be close
to what it fetches overseas.
The Government proposes to offer
wheatgrowers a choice between two
schemes for exported wheat. Both
schemes start by expanding the quan-
tity of export wheat to be covered by
a guaranteed price from the present
level of 150 million bushels to 175
million (any extra wheat is outside the
guarantee and therefore farmers only
get the international price). The crux
of the Government decision is to reduce
the export guarantee price by 20c to
$1.45 a bushel. According to one offer,
the price would be raised in 1970 to
$1.50 and be negotiable for the last
two years of the five-year term of the
agreement. The alternative offer would
be for rises on the $1.45 to be deter-
mined by an “index committee” each
year.
Which ever variant is adopted, the
steadily rising bill for the taxpayer in
subsidising wheat exports is likely to
be ended. Understandably, wheat-
farmers are extremely upset at the
proposals since they are bound to earn
less than they would by the continuance
of the present level of subsidy.
Country Party Members in wheat-
growing electorates have been seeking
out Mr. Peter Nixon, the Acting Prim-
ary Industry Minister, to know what
is happening. He is making the point
to them that this is only a tentative
proposal. Nothing is yet decided, he
says. It is formally a matter for nego-
tiations with the Wheatgrowers Fed-
eration and State Ministers of Agri-
culture at the Agricultural Council
meeting in Canberra in July. But the
Commonwealth provides all the money
for the subsidy scheme, so it must
have the final say, however much the
other parties to the negotiations may
protest.
Country Party Members see the
dark hand of their old adversary the
Treasury in the new scheme. But the
truth is that the Treasury and
Peter Nixon ... negotiations
Treasurer McMahon are sticking very
rigidly to the narrow field of budgetary
policy these days. The Treasury is
absolutely determined to avoid any
clash with Country Party Leader Mc-
Ewen and is not contesting any Coun-
try Party schemes. Mr. Mahon did not
buy into the wheat scheme discussions
in Cabinet. He was overseas when the
decision was made.
The truth of the affair is that the
old cost-of-production method of deter-
mining a guaranteed price came out
with ridiculous results. According to
accountants, economists, and other
experts it has always been a phony
concept, and political and budgetary
considerations have in fact determined
the figure—rather than the mass of
survey and statistical data gathered
from farmers about their costs.
In the past cost-of-production figures
could be manipulated to make them
politically and budgetarily acceptable.
But this year they shot up to an extra-
ordinary figure of about $2 per
bushel, which would involve a subsidy
something like $l5O million. This
$2 figure was wildly unrealistic be-
cause of the phoniness of the con-
cept. It implied in effect that the aver-
age wheatfarmer needed to get $2
a bushel in order to break even, that if
he got less he would be losing. But,
in fact, most wheatfarmers can do very
nicely on $1.20 or $1.30 per bushel.
A large proportion of the increase in
the cost-of-production figure to $2
was attributable to a rise in the “cost”
component of land values on wheat
farms. Earning very nice profits on
present guaranteed prices, land values
have been rising in wheat country. A
survey done by the Reserve Bank
showed that the average value of a
Doug Anthony . . . hard line
wheat farm had risen from $36,000 in
1960 to $Bl,OOO today.
Many people in Canberra would like
to abandon the cost-of-production
method of setting guaranteed prices
because of the nonsensical results it
produces. But while the Government
is heavily committed to it as a concept
and will probably have to retain it in
some form, it is certain to omit those
elements which relate to land values.
“It’s a silly inbuilt spiralling device,”
said one Canberra official. “We say the
cost of land has risen and the subsidy
to wheat goes up. That makes it more
profitable, so there is more intense com-
petition for land on which to grow it,
and the price of land goes up again.”
But it is not simply in wheat that a


tougher, more competition-oriented
Government policy seems to be evolv-
ing. Although no action has yet been
taken elsewhere, Country Party
Ministers have been taking a hard line
with several major interest groups
recently.
Minister for Primary Industry Doug
Anthony has been far tougher in his
speeches than his predecessor, Mr.
Adermann. In two major addresses in
Queensland recently, he virtually ruled
out the possibility of the Common-
wealth Government increasing hand-
outs to problem industries. “I do not
consider that the solution to Queens-
land’s problems lies in increased sub-
sidy,” he told the dairyfarmers at
Ipswich. “In fact, the problem would
be further aggravated.” And he went
on to extol the $25 million scheme for
eliminating a large number of marginal
dairyfarms. He quoted his Leader,
Mr. McEwen, as saying that some
farmers should get right out of dairy-
farming. “Let us face the truth of the
matter. There is ah oversupply of
butter in world markets and yet we
continue to add to it. The land which
is used to produce milk for butter can
be used equally well for other
products.”
He said his Department estimated
that about 2500 dairyfarms in Queens-
land, and another 4500 in other States,
were too small to be made economi-
cally viable even with improved pro-
ductivity. Under the $25 million scheme
he hoped for amalgamations of about
300 Queensland dairyfarms each year.
The scheme has to be approved and
administered by State Governments,
and they and the dairyfarmers are
expressing opposition to the initial Com-
monwealth proposals. They want
cheaper money than the 5.5 percent the
Government is offering. But they do
not seem opposed in principle, and Mr.
Nixon said last week that he had no
doubt that existing differences could
be ironed out at the Agricultural
Council meeting.
Farming representatives are taking an
increasingly broadminded and long-
term view of the problems of rural
industry in Australia and are less
inclined simply to scream for subsidies.
Australian representatives at a meeting
of the International Federation of Agri-
cultural Producers in Tunis last month
gave their support to a very liberal
charter for dairying. This declared
that “the long-term solution to prob-
lems of imbalance in the world dairy
industry should be sought through
structural adjustments.” And referred
to the need to “progressively put every
national dairy industry on a sound
economic footing.”
Such a policy would gradually
eliminate Government subsidies and
two-price schemes by which consumers
in producing countries subsidise exports
so that they can be dumped overseas
at less than production cost.
Even arch-protectionists for rural in-
terests seem to be thinking twice about
the possibility of ever-spiralling sub-
sidies. One of these is Mr. Peter Nixon,
who, when he isn’t acting Minister for
Primary Industries, is Minister for the
Interior. Speaking to Victorian dairy-
farmers recently, he said: “The Aus-
tralian industry has come a long way
and can justly claim to be among the
most efficient dairy industries of the
world.” But, he said, “You can do
better and you must do better. Only by
so doing can we continue the justifica-
tion of policies to assist this great in-
dustry with its problems.”
It looks then as though the Govern-
ment is firmly set on a course for pro-
gressively eliminating the need for dairy
industry subsidies. Of course, if Britain
were to join the Common Market and
eliminate the industry’s major export
market, the industry’s troubles would
be vastly accentuated and the period
of adjustment extended. But at least
the need for adjustment seems to be
realised now and to have become an
article of Government faith.
There may be similar developments
in another problem industry: sugar. So
far it has all been handouts and loans
for sugar and no attempt at adjusting
production downwards to meet the poor
level of demand in international
markets.
But listen to Mr. Anthony speaking
in Brisbane in March: “The extent of
community assistance to the sugar in-
dustry and other industries is being
questioned. People look at the home
price as a support price, a subsidy, at
loans and grants as coming out of the
community pocket. While you are be-
ing helped you will attract attention.
You will attract criticism. People will
want to look at your private accounts.
The bigger your problem is, and the
more it requires allocation of public
funds, the more critical you must
expect the community to be, and the
more your freedom of action may be
inhibited.
“You must always remember that
in a nation such as ours what any in-
dustry can expect to take from the
community must be in balance with
what that industry contributes to the
community. Your contributions to the
community in economic terms, in
social terms, in political terms will be
reassessed, and the extent to which
the general community is obligated or
not obligated to assist you will also be
reassessed. The community has con-
tributed substantially to the sugar in-
dustry to assert otherwise is irres-
ponsible and not facing up to the
facts.
“Let me say it to you this way. I
have heard the term ‘price require-
ment’ used, and figures as high as
$l3O per ton quoted. I can tell you
figures like this are in the realm of
fantasy. The Commonwealth could not
be in it politically. It is quite unreal
to be thinking in such terms. Do the
proposers of such figures realise they
are asking for $lOO million or about
half of the industry’s realisations?
“Any solution you propose regard-
ing stabilisation will not be looked at
very sympathetically unless you your-
selves suggest how you can contribute
to it; otherwise it is not stabilisation—
it is merely a continuing community
handout. And if you put forward pro-
posals which involve handouts for the
long-term future, the nation could only
assume that your own views of your
prospects were not hopeful.”
With the failure in Geneva last week
of attempts to get a new international
arrangement for sugar, the problem
becomes more pressing. There are cer-
tain to be proposals for rationalisation
in sugar.
Finally we can expect development
soon in cotton. This booming industry
now satisfies local spinning require-
ments completely and is moving into
the difficult export business. There it
will have to compete with heavily sub-
sidised American cotton and the cheap
fibre from underdeveloped countries.
The Government has departmental
submissions presently before it which
suggest a ceiling on the finance for
bounties, so that this does not become
too great a burden on the community
and does not develop into another prob-
lem industry.
Of course, with an emphasis on
greater economic viability and less-
ened subsidies in the rural sector, the
agricultural community has every
reason to expect similar trends to be
encouraged in manufacturing. Pres-
sure will therefore grow for a more
liberal approach to tariffs on manu-
factured goods, so that efficiency and
lower costs are engendered here.
Parliament
Belated Lynching
THE ATTEMPT by the Labor Party to
censure the new Army Minister, Mr.
Phillip Lynch, in the Federal Parlia-
ment last week flopped as badly as
former Labor Leader Arthur Calwell
heatedly warned the Labor Caucus it
would on the Wednesday morning
before the debate occurred. It should
have been brought on immediately after
the Townsend affair the week before,
Mr. Calwell said, while the matter was
still fresh in the minds of the public.
Mr. Calwell then got a good deal of
support from his colleagues with his
charges that Mr. Whitlam had “a lousy
sense of tactics.” He also sounded
plausible when he said that Mr. Whit-
lam didn’t have the stomach for a tough
debate.
The truth was, of course, that Mr.
Whitlam did not want the censure
motion at all. A fortnight ago he was
able to stave off demand for it when, in
a disorganised manner, Leftrwingers in
the Party raised it toward the end of a
caucus meeting. But by last week he
was unable to maintain control of his
Party, he bowed to pressure.
He was able to get his deputy, Mr.
Barnard, to lead off for the Labor Party


Army Minister Lynch at the recent Army-RAAF exercises at Singleton, N.S.W.
in presenting the censure, but only after
an unseemly wrangle about who should
be the subject of the censure —a wrangle
which Defence Minister Fairhall was
able to put to good political use.
The silly thing about the whole
censure debate was that there was
nothing substantial at issue. Government
members agreed with the Opposition
that Mr. Lynch, since he had taken
up his demanding portfolio, had made
some mistakes. Faced by an extra-
ordinarily testing succession of con-
troversial matters in his first 12 weeks
in the Ministry, he had on three occa-
sions used unwise phrases.
In the case of the Viet Gong girl
spy, he Inistakenly and prematurely said
there was “not a scintilla of evidence”
to support charges of torture. In the
case of Captain Rule, he went beyond
what many regarded as wise in pro-
viding information about a man about
to go before a court. In the most recent
case of the half-hourly awakened con-
scientious objector Simon Townsend
he had allowed himself to be badly
misunderstood.
The root causes of all three affairs
lay in happenings which occurred long
before Mr. Lynch took up the Ministry
of the Army. His mistakes were in the
superficial realm of public relations,
not in substantive matters of adminis-
tration or policy.
Mr. Barnard lectured the Govern-
ment about the unwisdom of giving
junior service portfolios to young men
new to the Ministry (a practice which,
of course, is really very popular with
the Opposition). He charged that Mr.
Lynch had failed to “get the ascendancy
of his Department,” something which
many Ministers never achieve, let
alone in their first three months.
When Mr. Whitlam followed, he
made some powerful points, but they
were completely irrelevant to the cen-
sure motion to which he was sup-
posed to be speaking. He had a point
against Defence Minister Fairhall, not
against Mr. Lynch, when he recalled
the abysmal slowness of the Govern-
ment in modernising the Services’
legal codes. As long as 30 months ago,
Mr. Fairhall promised to quickly in-
troduce legislation to update military
codes, but this hasn’t yet happened.
Mr. Whitlam also complained that
no explanation had been given of the
switch of Australian forces in Viet-
nam from their area of the Phuoc Tuy
province into the hazardous defence of
the American base at Bien Hoa. But
that, too, is the responsibility not of
Lynch but of the Defence Minister
and the Chiefs of Staff Committee.
In any case the shift dated from the
time when Mr. Malcolm Fraser was
Army Minister.
The Government was prepared for
a heavier attack and Prime Minister
Gorton delayed his departure for South-
East Asia in order to be on hand to
speak. He hadn’t read his brief on
the Townsend case (which cropped up
when he was in America), so, on the
advice of his Cabinet colleagues, he did
not speak. In any case he wasn’t needed.
Mr. Fairhall pointed out that the Army
was under wartime pressure and “it
would be beyond credulity if things
did not go wrong now and again.” But
Treasurer McMahon made the best
speech of the debate, proceeding
systematically through each of the
various complaints of the Opposition,
and reducing them to mere political
points.
Queensland, Liberals
The machine moves
ONE FACT emerged in strong focus
from last weekend’s Queensland Liberal
Party convention—the strength of the
party machine. State President Dr.
A. W. Hartwig was sharply defeated
by a majority unofficially set at three
to two when he sought re-election.
Again on Sunday he was defeated for
position on the party’s three-man con-
stitution and rules committee after he
had been nominated from the floor. It
was the culmination of months of near
open war, sparked off by what should
have been a routine Queensland by-
election.
At the centre of the problem was
Landsborough, on Queensland’s sun-
shine coast, a blue-ribbon Country
Party electorate held by the Premier,
Mr. (now Sir Francis) Nicklin, now to
retire. The problem was whether the
Liberal Party—partner with the Coun-
try Party in a coalition government
since 1957—should contest the seat or
not. The 1965 State Liberal conven-
tion laid down a policy of three-
cornered election contests. But the
Queensland State Executive on January
16 decided, following a plea by Par-
liamentary Liberal leader and Deputy
Premier Gordon Chalk, not to contest
the seat.
Despite this the Landsborough
Liberal electoral committee decided to
run Mr. Peter Nelson Gracie as a
candidate.
Dr. Hartwig said he would support
Mr. Nelson Gracie—but in a private
capacity and he would not use any of
the Party machinery available to him
as president. The situation became
critical when Dr. Hartwig walked out
of a State Executive meeting, on Febru-
ary 24, because he refused to accept a
motion of no confidence in him. The
executive then suspended Dr. Hartwig,
and the vice-presidents, Mr. L. G. Catt
and Mr. Eric Robinson, who was to
defeat Dr. Hartwig at last weekend’s
convention, took over running the
executive.
Within 48 hours Liberal MLAs
received notices from the executive
that they could not support Mr. Nelson
Gracie. Soon afterward the executive
voted 17 to 8 to continue Dr. Hart-
wig’s suspension until last week-
end’s convention. In the by-election Mr.
Nelson Gracie was soundly defeated bv
the “official coalition candidate,” Mr.
Michael Ahern, for the Country
Party.
The new president of the Queens-
land Liberal Party, Mr. Eric Robinson,
told a meeting of Young Liberals in
Brisbane a fortnight ago that the
Liberal Party could become the major
coalition partner by 1972. It was
important that the Party strive to main-
tain Liberal principles and Liberal
rights in redistribution. It was unfair
to Queensland that the Liberal Party,
with more than 200,000 votes, should
have only 20 seats while the Country
Party, with about 150,000 votes, should
have 27. “But we haven’t the staff nor
the membership for a Cairns-to-Cool-
angatta approach,” he said. “We ought
to be selective and offer ourselves
initially only for those electorates in
which we have a reasonable chance of
success!”
There had been speculation in the
past few months that the rift between
the rival factions had widened to such
an extent that a split was possible. But
the old Liberal machinery took the
strain and last weekend proved itself
more than able to cope.

The Asian tour
Prime Minister
Gorton as hawk
By BOB BAUDINO
THE STATEMENTS of Mr. Gorton
in Saigon and to Australian troops in
the field at the weekend bared a few
unsuspected claws. But where they
were said, the manner in which they
were said, to whom they were said,
and the way in which they were re-
ceived have clearly lifted the achieve-
ments of Mr. Gorton’s first visit to
Vietnam above those of a swim in the
South China Sea and the Army’s
hurried move to give the YMCA two
huts at Vung Tau after two years in
a tent.
Reassurance of continued Australian
support soon emerged as the main aim
of his Vietnam program. He opened
his campaign of reassurance (a policy
on which Gorton himself had cast doubt
in earlier impetuous statements) very
early in his visit—at the ceremonial
arrival. To the sound of rockets and
napalm being used by helicopter gun-
ships attacking a Viet Cong area in
full view of the strangely detached and
incongruous official welcome at Tan
Son Nhut Airport, Mr. Gorton said: “I
see this visit as reaffirming Australia’s
support for Vietnam” and later “at
Manila in 1966 the allied nations clearly
expressed their hopes and objectives
for a peaceful settlement of the war in
Vietnam. Our aims have not changed
and no military, political, and diplo-
matic efforts by Hanoi will undermine
our resolve to achieve a lasting peace
under which the people of Vietnam will
live in freedom and justice.”
Within an hour Mr. Gorton was
repeating his assurances to President
Thieu, at an official luncheon, and to
the Prime Minister of South Vietnam,
Tran Van Huong.
Vietnamese leaders later were openly
praising Gorton’s “firm” statements and
wondering how they could have
doubted him or his Government. Gor-
ton gained added strength in Saigon by
his personal courage in insisting on con-
tinuation of his visit to the capital,
although Viet Cong at 3 o’clock that
morning had beaten the official wel-
come with a barrage of 13 rockets, one
into the garden of the State Residence,
where Gorton was to spend the follow-
ing night. Saigon needed his visit, the
first from a Head of State this year. It
gave them a chance to show the world
that their security in Saigon still com-
manded respect. It was a palliative
for the growing disquiet among their
people and some members of the
National Assembly.
They did not mar the honor Gorton
had done them by indelicately suggest-
ing Australia might increase its forces
in an effort to bring its stated aims to
fruition. Instead, the leaders of South
Vietnam concentrated on huge welcom-
ing banners and a massive guard of
South Vietnamese regulars armed with
automatic weapons, which lined all
routes taken by Mr. Gorton. Members
of the 16-man Press party with the
Prime Minister also enjoyed compara-
tive freedom, although some important
people, including Vice-President Ky
(reportedly ill at his country home),
were unavailable for one reason or
another for interviews. The planned
interview with Thieu fell through when
he also disappeared after casting an
eye over the gourmet specialties strategi-
cally placed among strings of orchids
on the long tables.
But Gorton did not let matters rest
in Saigon. He had another important
job to do to reassure the Australian
Forces themselves. At Nui Dat the next
day, Saturday, he told members of the
Australian Task Force “for every nut
who carries a placard or sits in the
middle of the roadway there are 100
Australians with you and 90 percent
of the Australian people are behind you
in what you are trying to do.” Then
the hawkish tendencies Mr. Gorton has
been showing on this trip made
within a week of his visit to the United
States again emerged. “The Paris
peace talks are not peace talks. They
are preliminary talks to see whether
there is any basis for a chance to have
talks later. You will be interested to
know that so far it has been quite
impossible to persuade the North Viet-
namese negotiators to admit there are
any North Vietnamese troops in South
Vietnam at all. I dare say you would
be able to correct them on that if you
could get over there, but that is the
stage it has reached so far. I would not
build too many hopes too quickly on
that. The hopes are to complete the
job, finish the job, and give the South
Vietnamese people a chance to elect
their own government and to demon-
strate that aggression by force does not
pay.”

Capital punishment
A Senate Bill
LAST WEEK Lord Casey, Governor-
General of the Co’mmonwealth,
approved a 28-day stay of execution
for a 29-year-old Portuguese convicted
of murdering another man in the
Northern Territory. Ironically, only
four days earlier the Senate, by 24
votes to 21, had carried a Private
Member’s Bill to abolish the death
penalty in all Commonwealth Terri-
tories. But it is unlikely that the Portu-
guese, Jose Manuel da Costa, will
benefit from the Senate’s decision. His
only hopes lie in either an appeal
to the High Court or having the
sentence commuted reasonable pro-
positions, as the Northern Territory’s
hangman has had only three victims
ever.
But the Death Penalty Abolition Bill
still has to work its way through the
House of Representatives, and there
seems little chance of this happening
for some time. House Leader Billie
Snedden has consistently refused to set
a date for the debate, or to promise a
free vote for Government Members,
on the grounds that the Labor Party
would vote in a bloc, following Labor
policy.
To the Government’s credit, it did
allow a free vote in the Senate per-
mitting Western Australian Country
Party Senator Prowse to join the
Opposition, Independent Tasmanian
Senator Turnbull, and the DLP’s Frank
McManus to ensure the passage of the
Bill.
Although most of the Government
voted against the Bill in the Senate,
only two Works Minister R. C.
Wright and new Senator Ivor Green-
wood—were prepared to oppose it in
debate. Senator Wright huffed and
puffed that the States were mostly
responsible for capital punishment, and
the Senate, as a States’ Rights House,
had no right to initiate such legisla-
tion.
Senator Prowse revealed some pre-
vious inner conflicts on the question.
The trouble was the rigidity of the
punishment. “A man cannot be hanged
a little bit,” he said.
The Opposition speakers all re-
hashed the long-standing arguments
against capital punishment. Western
Australian John Wheeldon probably
put the case as succintly as any of his
colleagues when he said, “The
degree of civilisation of a society may
be judged by its treatment of those
people within it who offend against its
laws. Insofar as a society is barbarous
in its treatment of people whom it has
found to be offenders, it may be re-
garded as a barbaric society.”
The House of Representatives, where
Opposition Leader Gough Whitlam in-
troduced the Bill last Wednesday, will
be a tougher nut for the abolitionists
to crack. Although Labor will vote in
a bloc if and when a vote is taken on
the Bill in the Lower House, the
Opposition will be in a much more
difficult position, because the Govern-
ment could afford a few defectors and
still be sure of defeating the Bill.
Holyoake,
wanting
assurances
from
Australia
New Zealand
ANZUS question
THE LATE announcement by New
Zealand Prime Minister Holyoake that
he would head the New Zealand dele-
gation to this week’s five-power defence
talks in Kuala Lumpur can be read
as a desire to encourage Australia to
stay in the region, to keep avenues open
for further consultation, to ascertain
Britain’s intentions after 1971, to play
the Commonwealth elder statesman,
and to compensate for the inadequacies
of N.Z. Defence Minister Thompson,
who, as delegation leader, might not
have grasped that the Kuala Lumpur
talks are more important for foreign
policy than for defence.
New Zealand’s foreign policy makers
feel neither Australia nor N.Z. are in
a position, yet, to accommodate them-
selves to the British withdrawal, with
decisive foreign policy changes. Neither
Australia nor New Zealand can find
all the answers in Kuala Lumpur, but
New Zealand will be looking for some,
and postponing any decision to increase
military involvement.
“New Zealand has enough troops to
get herself into trouble, but not enough
to get her out,” was the feeling that
restrained New Zealand delegates from
over-commitment as they approached
Kuala Lumpur. New Zealand wanted
to know Britain’s plans for the post-
-1971 period in Malaysia and Singa-
pore Malaysian and Singaporean re-
actions to the remnants of British
power the likely degree of co-
operation between the Malaysians and
Singaporeans. New Zealand will not
base judgment on what policy to follow
on these factors alone. U.S. intentions
in Asia will figure prominently in the
calculations of a Government which
has continuously taken its cue in post-
war Asian policy from Washington and
Canberra.
The New Zealand Government’s view
is that the U.S. Presidential elections
and the Vietnam war will need to have
finished before Wellington and Can-
berra can be convinced ANZUS will
back N.Z. and Australian commitments
in Malaysia and Singapore.

OVERSEAS
The meaning of
Bobby Kennedy
TWO REMARKABLE things happened
to Robert Kennedy in his brief, three-
month campaign for the Presidency
which started only last March.
The first was the revelation to him
personally of just how much he had
come to mean to the deprived and dis-
possessed throughout America. In the
faces of trusting dependence and in
the shining eyes of adoration whether
among the Negroes of Watts or the
Mexicans of Ventura he suddenly
came to see that he had become the
steward of a lot of hopes, the trustee
of innumerable dreams. These were not
merely voters whose support he needed
and wanted: they were people who
really believed In him.
But the second thing he learnt was
not so encouraging. It was that the best
of the nation’s youth had come to see
in him a false god, a Lucifer who had
fallen from heaven. To his credit, Bobby
Kennedy never complained of the
judgment that the campuses which he
had wooed so long and hard had finally
made against him. He knew why they
had done it and perhaps would have
thought less of them if they had not.
In the last few days of his life, after
the Oregon defeat, he seemed indeed
hardly to care whether personally he
succeeded or failed. “The cause,” he kept
saying, “is greater than any individual,”
and by making the kind of total
•emotional commitment against the
status quo, from which the cautious,
arithmetical part of his nature had
always held him back, he seemed to
Lave achieved a sort of personal
liberation.
In any man’s death there is always
Members of the Kennedy family and
President Johnson (hands behind back)
at the grave of Robert Kennedy
a danger of romanticism, and it has
therefore to be pointed out that this
represented a new, and in some ways
surprising, development. The Kennedy
who finally and uncompromisingly
aligned himself with the “forces of
change” in America had, stripped of
the legend, for most of his career
operated as a highly conventional pro-
fessional politician.
In 1960, when he master-minded his
brother’s campaign for the Presidency,
the wrapping on the package may have
said “new frontier,” but inside, the
parcel contained nothing but an old-line
power-broker’s approach to popular
electioneering.
Kennedys, one was given to under-
stand, did not believe in needlessly bat-
tering their heads if what they >vere
meeting was a brick wall. And that
probably more than anything else was
what was wrong with his whole
approach to the Presidential race this
year. The fatal flaw in his campaign—
when it finally developed—was that
no one believed his explanations of
why he had delayed his attack on
American policy in Vietnam. Instead
virtually everyone accepted that he had
held back out of a nervous premonition
as to what his chances really were.
In the human sense, it was a strange
attitude for Bobby Kennedy to have,
for in personal relationships he was the
very opposite of cautious or timid. He
was one of the most candid and honest
public figures of his generation. Whether
he was talking about Harold Wilson
(“I think he’s in LBJ’s pocket, don’t
you?”) or dismissing an influential
Washington editor (“He was always
the President’s friend, not mine I
never liked him or trusted him”). He
rarely, if ever, took refuge in saying
anything he did not believe. It was
this open and direct approach that
could have made him, particularly
after the LBJ years, just the kind of
President the nation needed.
If he had got to the White House,
he would certainly have faced almost
overwhelming difficulties and prob-
lems. He had always been unpopular
with Congress, the. mystical confidence
that the poor had in him would very
quickly have turned to disillusionment
if he had failed to deliver and—if only
because of the ruthless reputation he
had acquired for himself in his three
and a half years as Attorriey-General
—his use of executive power would
have been jealously and vigilantly
watched by all his opponents.
But there would at least have been
an effort at open communion between
the White House and the people. What
perhaps he felt most strongly about
the days, when his brother sat in the
White House and he hovered at his
right hand was that whatever mistakes
had been made they at least repre-
sented a period when the U.S. at last
seemed to belong to all those who in
their own generation were creating it.
Unquestionably it was that spirit that
he most wanted to restore to the
American people.
In private he was often said to be
a shy, reserved man—and in many ways
he was. But he did relax sometimes,
usually late at night when returning
on an aeroplane after a day’s cam-
paigning.
Bobby Kennedy was never pompous
or stuffy. As the “king-over-the-water”
of American politics, he could not pre-
vent courtiers and flatterers from
attaching themselves to him. But
though he often enjoyed their com-
pany he rarely if ever relied on their
judgments.
The men he respected were those
(frequently on his own staff) who stood
up to him, argued with him, and told
him why he was wrong. The people
he despised were those whom he sus-
pected of trying to ingratiate themselves
with him.
He was not by any means a natural
public performer, though he gradually
picked up a comedian’s slick technique
of warming-up an audience. When con-
fronted with tough questions, he was
often strangely inarticulate, he never
did learn how to deliver a prepared
platform speech, and he lacked entirely
both his older and his younger
brother’s easy outgoing manner.
But he nevertheless brought to politics
exactly the same qualities that he car-


ried with him on to the touch-football
field. The legend always had it other-
wise, but he never had any real inborn
aptitude for either activity. What he
did possess, and brought to bear, was
total unwavering application, a relent-
less (rather than ruthless) determin-
ation to win and a willingness in the
process to exhaust himself beyond the
limits of most other men.
In a way, those are all no doubt
admirable attributes — but they never-
theless leave out an essential dimension
of political greatness, a commitment to
some cause bigger than personal ambit-
ion. The real tragedy of Bobby Ken-
nedy is that by the time he was killed
he had discovered just such a commit-
ment. From the poor he had learned
that his career was no longer really his
own property, not even the Kennedy
family’s. The young had taught him
that not all the glamor and magnetism
in the world can disguise calculation as
conviction. And at that moment he died.
exit McCarthy?
EVEN BEFORE the Los Angeles assas-
sination, the shrewdest political judg-
ment maintained that the worst thing
that could happen to Eugene McCarthy
would be for Bobby Kennedy to with-
draw from the race. This superficially
surprising view was fully endorsed by
McCarthy’s campaign managers: they
believed that McCarthy by himself
could never beat Humphrey, but that
in the confused situation of a three-way
race at the convention he had at least
a chance of coming out on top. But
whatever that chance was, McCarthy
has now lost it: from now on the
McCarthy crusade faces the prospect of
having to fight the entrenched power
of the Party establishment all by itself.
At this time it certainly looks as if
it will be an unequal struggle. A con-
vention, after all, is a forum of the
Party professionals’ own choosing. Yet
some McCarthy supporters still claim to
see, with or without Teddy Kennedy, a
possible scenario of success for next
August. According to this theory, if
anyone is the man for this season of
Senator Eugene McCarthy pushes his
way through cameramen into the Good
Samaritan Hospital, Los Angeles
national discontent it is Gene McCarthy
with his appeal to reason and not to
passion, his proclaimed belief in
restraint rather than excess, and
(perhaps above all) his decisive lead
in the polls, if not with Democratic
supporters, then very heavily with
Republicans and independent voters.
Just conceivably, depending on what
the polls show in the 70 days remaining
before the Democratic convention, there
could be something in that assessment.
It’s a slight hope. But it will probably
keep McCarthy in the ring.
THE NEXT IN THE CLAN
THE SMOKE-FILLED ROOMS have
already laid their plans for Teddy Ken-
nedy. For the moment those plans do
not envisage placing him on the top
spot for the Democratic-nomination.
Compromise, however, is the cement of
politics — and the ticket which has
suddenly come to look totally irresistible
to some Party managers is one that
combines the names of Hubert Hump-
hrey for President and Edward Kennedy
for Vice-President.
Could it come about? For the time
being, everyone is guessing, even the
men with the big cigars. But it is a
sign of just how pivotal a figure the sole
surviving Kennedy brother has now be-
come. At 36, Edward Moore Kennedy,
who would certainly much rather have
it otherwise, is the one man in the
Party whom everyone wants to court.
For a Kennedy, Teddy is a strangely
unknown quantity: generally regarded
as much more conventional than his
brother (“Bobby,” he once remarked,
“believes in high-risk politics — I
don’t”), widely praised for his ability
to get on with people (he is respected
in the Senate where Bobby was resented)
and universally acknowledged as the
prototype team player.
Yet, there is another side. Teddy
Kennedy is commonly said to have
opposed his brother’s decision to run
for the Presidency this year, and that is
true. But he did change his mind and
his advice long before the ballots in
New Hampshire came in and was
actively encouraging Bobby to get in
the race. Nor did he give in to Lyndon
Johnson — which surprised and dis-
mayed the White House — when he
preferred to let his own State delega-
tion go to Eugene McCarthy rather than
fall in with the national party establish-
ment’s plan to make Teddy himself a
stand-in candidate for the President in
Massachusetts.
Finally, and perhaps conclusively,
long before his older brother was say-
ing such heretical things, Teddy Ken-
nedy at least once publicly warned the
Party if the Vietnam war went on un-
changed then Lyndon Johnson would
in all probability be defeated for renom-
ination.
It is, therefore, at least arguable
that the Party professionals do not
know their Teddy Kennedy—and that
they may be in for a shock. Certainly,
what they and Hubert Humphrey now
Edward Kennedy with his brother’s
coffin leaving St. Patrick’s Cathedral,
New York
seem prepared to ask of the lone sur-
vivor of the dynasty is almost breath-
taking in its presumption. To do so
would mean publicly repudiating every
appeal his brother made from the
moment of his original announcement
of candidature on March 17 to his
final plea for unity among “the forces
of change,” just two or three minutes
before he was shot.
No one at the moment has any idea
what Teddy Kennedy himself proposes
to do. Indeed, his mind is almost cer-
tainly far more preoccupied with his
responsibilities for a family of 16
young children (the former President's,
his brother Bobby’s, and his own) than
it is with considerations of electoral
politics. It can, however, safely be
said that it would surprise and astonish
those who know him best if he
tamely fell in with the Party manage-
ment’s Machiavellian plans.
But this does not mean that he will
necessarily follow the example of
Richard Goodwin, the former chief
speech-writer for Bobby Kennedy, who
became the first member of the
Kennedy machine to break ranks.
On television Goodwin announced that
he felt that anyone who believes in
change in America should now enlist
under the banner of Senator McCarthy,
even if it all ends up with nothing
more than organising write-in protest
votes in a Humphrey-Nixon contest.
Having been McCarthy men at the
beginning, it seems a safe bet that most
of the intellectuals associated with
Bobby Kennedy will now identify them-
selves with the McCarthy campaign.
Will that, however, be equally true
of the old political retainers of the
Kennedy family men like Theodore
Sorensen, Pierre Salinger, and most
glaring of all LBJ’s former
Postmaster-General, Larry O’Brien?
Over this there is much more doubt
and it is a doubt that is unlikely to
be resolved until Teddy Kennedy de-


cides what course he will follow him-
self.
Only three choices seem open to
him: to support Humphrey (whether
or not accepting the offer of a second
place on the ticket), to follow what
his brother had certainly been prepared
to do if he had lost in California
(throw his support behind McCarthy),
or simply sit this year’s Presidential
contest out (thereby setting all Ken-
nedy followers free to follow their
own best interests).
Among most of those who claim to
understand Kennedy political motiva-
tion there is substantial agreement that
it is the third and easiest choice that
Teddy Kennedy will elect to make.
The battle among the top echelons
of Kennedy supporters on the issue will
probably go on for a week or two
yet, but the victory ultimately seems
bound to go to the political profes-
sionals rather than the intellectual
amateurs.
NIXON AS PRESIDENT?
THE DEATH of Senator Robert
Kennedy most seems destined to result
in the one thing he was fighting to
prevent — the nomination of Vice-
President Hubert Humphrey at the
Democratic Party convention in August.
Beyond that, there is the strengthened
possibility of the election of former
Vice-President Richard Nixon to the
Presidency in November.
Throughout these past weeks, while
McCarthy and Kennedy have been
battling for delegate votes in the
primaries of Wisconsin, Nebraska,
Indiana, South Dakota, Oregon, and
California, the Humphrey campaign
machine has been quietly and efficiently
assembling a greater quantity of dele-
gate support in other and more
numerous States. In the absence of
active campaigning, this trend will
doubtless continue and gather strength.
On the face of it, with his most
formidable Democrat opponent removed
from the field, there seems little doubt
that Humphrey will win his Party’s
nomination.
On the Republican side, Kennedy’s
death will also have a striking effect —
and, again, in the direction that was
most alien to him. Of the two Republi-
can contenders — Richard Nixon and
New York’s Governor Nelson Rocke-
feller — Nixon continues to be far in
the lead. Rockefeller’s slim hope of
wresting the Party nomination from his
rival lay in his strategy for arduous
campaigning throughout the country.
But with the lull, Nixon will continue
to gather the vital promises of support
from his Party officials.
In an election between Nixon and
Humphrey, voters across the nation
who have been violently opposed to
President Johnson’s Vietnam policies
may reluctantly turn to Nixon as a
means of bringing about some change
in the direction of U.S. foreign policy.
Although 20 years ago Humphrey
emerged in national politics as a great
liberal and Civil Rights campaigner, his
popular image has since changed com-
pletely. He is now widely regarded as
a total Johnson man, who might run
his own administration as Lyndon John-
son has been running his.
This election year has already had
more political shocks than almost any
other in American history. But, as it
looks today, the death of one of
America’s best-known liberals will mean
a victory for the forces of conservatism.
THE NEGROES' LOSS
AT 4.27 A.M. on Wednesday the loud-
speakers crackled over the mud around
the “instant shanty town” of the poor
that has sprung up in the heart of
official Washington. “Attention, resi-
dents of Resurrection City. Senator
Kennedy has been shot. Keep calm,
keep calm.”
From the White House, 12 minutes’
walk away, and across the river at the
Pentagon the alert had already gone out:
the city’s 3000 police and 1500 firemen
were put on 12-hour shifts and all leave
cancelled, several thousand riot-trained
troops in the capital and in Los Angeles
were put on standby, the emergency
communications centre — last used in
the April riots that followed the murder
of Dr. Martin Luther King — was
manned.
Elsewhere in cities across America the
pattern was the same, the official alert,
the sniffing of the wind, the feeding
back of reports to what is virtually a
national riot control centre — complete
with computer and manned 24 hours a
day — at the Department of Justice in
Washington. The air of crisis was more
than just a mark of America’s racial
tensions: it reflected the extraordinary
emotional bond that had sprung up
between Robert Kennedy, a white mil-
lionaire and politician, and the black
poor.
Within 24 hours Robert Kennedy had
joined his brother in a Negro pantheon
of martyrs: John Kennedy, Malcolm X,
Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King...
the litany of those who have spoken
out against oppression, sworn to fight
it, and died by conspiracy — because
that, overwhelmingly, is how black
America sees it —•’ is one name longer.
And what they said had an awful
sameness of shock and disbelief and
bitterness and loss of hope.
In a way that no American politician
has probably ever matched, Bobby Ken-
nedy had won the hearts and the votes
of Negroes and the poor.
He was introduced to a meeting in
black Washington as “our blue-eyed
soul brother”—and “soul” is halfway
to a sacred word in this year of a new
black consciousness. Black men drove
round in cars with “Sock it to ’em,
Bobby” stickers on the bumpers. In
Watts, a phalanx of uniformed black
militants escorted him, shouting “Make
way for the President!” In Columbus,
Ohio, he left the State’s Democratic
delegates—the men whose votes he
needed in Chicago—waiting in a hotel
for two hours while he mixed with
Negro crowds on the streets.
Sometimes the enthusiasm of the
crowds—black or white —frightened his
aides. They mobbed him, dragged him
from his open car, overturned plat-
forms, once pushed him against the
car hard enough to break a tooth
and split his lip. They pressed gifts
on him: once a wedding ring. And they
snatched souvenirs: aides bought his
cufflinks a dozen pairs at a time. Last
.week, in a 16-mile motorcade through
the Mexican-American suburbs south of
Los Angeles, he lost both shoes.
The popularity had gone beyond
something that could be examined or
challenged or even talked about: to
air the slightest criticism of Robert
Kennedy among Negroes was to pro-
duce not anger or argument but hurt
silence.
Both his rivals have associated them-
selves with Resurrection City—Humph-
rey visited the site, McCarthy sup-
porters have sent large donations. Yet
without his name being mentioned it
has sometimes seemed as though the
whole display the marches through
America, the camp of 3000 people—
White politician in a sea of black faces
as Kennedy campaigned in Indiana
has been part of a Kennedy-for-
President campaign.
His popularity had angered the Black
Nationalists, who reject all white in-
stitutions: It was alleged in New York
this week —where two Negroes faced
conspiracy-to-murder charges that
Bobby Kennedy’s name had been added
to a list of moderate Civil Rights
Leaders who were to be assassinated.
Part, of the reason, said Negro
leader James Farmer himself stand-
ing for Congress in New York was
the aura around the Kennedy name, the
image of the slain President who would
not have been killed but for his views
on civil rights.
But John Kennedy had won this
support as a President, not a candi-
date. He never campaigned in the
ghettoes in the way that Bobby had
been doing.
But it was more than this. In a way
no other politician here has matched,
Bobby Kennedy had identified himself
totally with the soul, the gut feelings


of poverty. When he talked about the
poor, he did not just use statistics. He
threw out sharp images of the rural
poverty he had seen, of starving
children, of Indian reservations where
the commonest cause of death for
teenagers was suicide, of the despair
of ghettoes, of the violence of institu-
tions.
“If you want tranquillisers, vote for
someone else,” was his answer to
Humphrey. “If you see a small black
child starving to death in the Missis-
sippi Delta, as I have, you know this
is not the politics of joy.”
In a way his death is more alarm-
ing than that of Dr. King. Suddenly
this summer the largest Negro vote
•ever —a vote some had forecast would
decide the election — has nowhere it
wants to go.
THE VIOLENT SOCIETY
IFROM LOS ANGELES to New York
the air of the United States is full of
generalisations about the violence of
American society. For now, as people
here are just beginning to emerge from
the shock and shame of Robert Ken-
nedy’s death, they are asking questions
about the assassination of five prominent
Americans during the past five years:
John Kennedy, Medgar Evers, Malcolm
X, Martin Luther King, and Robert
Kennedy.
The first question is whether there is
any common factor here.
One explanation goes that the U.S. is
a violent society, probably more violent
than others. Others point out that only
the progressive leaders have been shot
and argue that there must be some con-
nection.
A distinguished Californian crimin-
ologist puts forward an original alter-
native theory. He declines to accept
what he calls the simplistic notion that
the whole culture is to blame, because
if it were then the victims would be
equally distributed between left and
right. Equally he declines to accept the
coincidence theory as being also too
-simplistic. He puts forward a “prob-
ablistic theory,” as follows.
The link between the murders is not
conspiracy, he argues, but the social
philosophy of simple remedies. Ameri-
can society is dividing more and more:
the result of Vietnam, race riots, etc.
The left is going further left, the
minority groups are becoming more and
more cut off from other groups, the
right is going further right. The right
-especially believes in very simple reme-
dies, nuclear weapons to solve the Viet-
man War, cutting student grants to stop
■student unrest, more and better-armed
police to stop race riots, wider use of
the death penalty to stop murders. The
left, on the whole, sees life as more
complex.
Now, of all simple remedies, assas-
Sirhan Sirhan is seized by police
moments after Senator Robert Kennedy
was wounded
sination is the simplest: remove one
man, and the problem will be solved.
The murders, in the criminologists
theory, were connected to this extreme
right section of American society, and
infected by it. The signs of violence
do indeed seem to be everywhere,
once one starts to look. The rate of
murder is unquestionably very high.
In California there has been a strange
series of large-scale acts of sabotage
against public utilities around San
Francisco: pylons blown up, electricity
cables severed. Three months or so ago,
a man shot dead a neighbor’s dog that
was annoying him. More recently,
elsewhere in the U.S., another man was
annoyed by the noise being made by
a neighbor’s son, and shot him.
By now California is awash in guns,
though the gun laws of California are
stricter than in many other States. The
Attorney-General said this week that
he had official knowledge of 2,600,000
guns in California, which works out at
one weapon for every two or three
adults. Not all those with guns intend to
use them. The girl secretary at a univer-
sity collects them, purely as decoration.
Governor Ronald Reagan collects guns:
“I like guns,” he says. That the virtues
of the old West still survive in the
present day is an important idea for
thousands of Californians to maintain:
a clean ideal of self-reliance.
These are the signs and symbols of
violence. For the causes, everyone has
his own ideas. Here is a sociologist:
“America’s just harder on everybody.
We still have 300,000 immigrants a
year, and immigrants have a hard life:
language, and where to live, and so
on. Welfare services are much more
disorganised than in most places,
partly because everyone moves
around.”
A psychologist: “There really is a
long undercurrent of violence in
American life. Perhaps the veneer of
civilisation is a little thinner here.
There is a desperate quality to Ameri-
can life. Americans are often very
enthusiastic: does that mask the
desperation?”
A historian: “How far is violence
a new social phenomenon? You know
Rap Brown’s statement that violence
is as American as apple pie. That fits
my intuition, though I can’t say
whether it’s more than any other
society. But we do have the whole
frontier syndrome, and serious labor
unrest till the 19305, and the Civil
War itself, and Indian massacres.”
A hundred years ago lynching by
vigilante committees and street shoot-
ings were commonplace in San Fran-
cisco and Los Angeles. At the end of
the last century, in a union struggle,
seven members of the fa’mous syndi-
calist Wobblies, the industrial workers
of the world, were castrated. As late
as July 5, 1934, on bloody Thursday,
two strikers, a longshoreman and a
cook were shot dead by police during
a battle in San Francisco.
These are obscure questions. The
immediate fear everywhere in America
at the moment is that the five assassina-
tions will be followed by another. As
everyone knows, acts of violence in
some fiendish way stimulate imitators
assassins as well as suicides and
there is a peculiar inverse glory to be
had from murdering prominent public
figures. The concentration of a hundred
million television sets on every detail
in the life of a hitherto obscure Jor-
danian must be stirring a few envious
thoughts across the country.
Italy's Communists
One in three
AS MOST of Italy looks, with a sense
of shock, at the goings-on in France,
one man in Rome sits back with a
broad smile on his usually dogged
features. Signor Luigi Longo, the 68-
year-old boss of the PCI, the biggest
Communist Party in Western Europe,
has made major gains almost every-
where, in a general election which was-
expected to show Red losses, and he
has managed very comfortably without
student help.
Not that Longo does not hope to draw
extra dividends from unrest in the uni-
versities: but the bonus he has earned
of nearly one million more votes puts-
him in a much stronger position than
comrades in France. He has shown that
his grip on the Italian working class is
even firmer than before, and that he can
direct events instead of being dragged
along by them.
The opportunity of re-establishing a
somewhat shaky authority in the PCl’s
six-storey headquarters near Rome’s
“wedding cake” monument to King
Victor Emanuel comes at a timely junc-
ture. Signor Longo has had a hard pull
since he became secretary general four
years ago in succession to the legendary
Palmiro Togliatti. Recent rivals have
played on activist discontent with his
“soft sell” policy.
Now the election successes have not
only consolidated Longo’s position but
justified his program of offering a
“popular front” shopwindow almost free
of Party dogma. It contains nothing

more alarming than improved economic
plans, fewer monopolies, “dialogue” with
the Catholic Left, and “an end to social
injustices.” And, of course, there are
pledges of support waiting for any
group with a grievance against the
establishment.
With 177 Deputies in the 630-mem-
ber Chamber (ten more than last time)
and 75 seats in the 315-member Senate,
the Communists will be the leading
Opposition Party for the next five
years. Their ally, this time, is the new,
ultra-Left PSIUP (Proletarian Social-
ists), which has broken away from the
middle-of-the-road Socialist Party under
Pietro Nenni and won a useful 4.5
Communist boss Luigi Longo ... Com-
rades in Moscow delighted with him
percent of the total votes mainly at
the expense of their old comrades.
But four years in the secretary-
general’s chair have taught Longo the
need for compromise and tact in woo-
ing an electorate with the fastest eco-
nomic growth rate in Europe which
remains almost as Catholic in sentiment
as in the days of Pius XII, 20 cold-war
years ago, when voting “Red” meant
excommunication.
The Communists Say the campaign
cost them less than $2 million: others
estimate that they spent six times as
much and that most of it, as usual,
came from Russia.
Since Moscow paid the piper, Longo’s
tune must have been approved in the
Kremlin. This, indeed, is plain enough
In questions which bear on the mili-
tary balance of east and west. But
the usual Communists’ demands for
withdrawal from NATO and cuts in
service expenditure were subordinated
to domestic issues such as the
“democratisation” of the Army, legalis-
ation of divorce, and law, tax, and
university reforms.
Nationalisation an idea which has
worn threadbare over past elections
was not pressed. “We don’t today con-
sider it an urgent problem,” says Longo.
“We want, first, to stop such giant
monopolists as Fiat and Montedison
from controlling the State. This would
best be done by giving workers a say
in their organisation.”
This vague formula, which flatters the
workingman without threatening the
basis of his present prosperity, is also
hopefully designed to lull the Italian
business world.
No less open-minded is the new Com-
munist attitude to its old enemy the
Church. Longo makes much of the
“ferment and progress in the Roman
Catholic world,” and some of his refer-
ences to Vatican Council reforms were
almost rapturous.
“Today,” he tells startled followers,
“we are watching the Church rise above
the conservatism which made it, in
Marx’s words, the opiate of the people.”
His wish to enter into a dialogue with
the Catholics is not a political expedient,
he protests. “It is part of our conception
of the Italian way to Socialism: a search
for new rapport with groups that face
the same problems of work, peace, and
the aspiration to combat injustice.”
If the Vatican shows little relish for
dialogue with Longo, it is also at times
inhibited in saying so by Pope Paul’s
policy of better relations with Russia
and the Iron Curtain countries. This
muted attitude encouraged dissident
Catholics to vote Left. A few even stood
for parliament with Communist sup-
port. A poll showed that a majority of
Catholics found nothing inconsistent
with religion in voting Communist.
Now the Communists, with their
PSIUP fellow-travellers, can claim that
31.4 percent of the nation supports them.
Longo’s daily newspaper, “L’Unita,”
has published a picture of an Italian
crowd scene with every third individual
colored red. The Comrades in Moscow
must have been delighted with their
copies.

"De-foreignising" the war
By PETER SAMUEL
“YOU KNOW, the Americans, for all
their generosity, are mean and miser-
able bastards sometimes. Look at the
old pop-guns they give those little
blokes. And then they complain about
their unaggressive tactics.” We were
passing a truckful of Vietnamese
soldiers being taken out to do battle
with the North Vietnamese on Planta-
tion Road, beyond the airport. The
rifles they clasped were an odd assort-
ment, probably World War II or
Korean vintage, and they were going
out to fight an enemy equipped with
the best personal weapon Russian
military technology can supply the
AK-47. “It’s time we dropped the dip-
lomatic niceties and said just what we
thought,” my companion continued.
“It’s time the Americans stopped treat-
ing these people like bloody colonials.
And you can quote me on that if you
want to.”
I was driving through the northern
suburbs of Saigon with the Malaysian
Ambassador to Vietnam, Mr. J. Da
Silva, the hard-hitting foreign-service
officer who made his way to the top
of the Foreign Affairs Department in
Kuala Lumpur for his key role in run-
ning the resistance to Sukarno’s con-
frontation.
He was echoing a complaint which
is increasingly voiced in Saigon these
days, especially since “de-Americani-
sation” has become one of the guiding
slogans of official policy. It is accepted
by South Vietnamese, as well as by
Americans, that any further increase
in the American effort is most unlikely;
that a likely outcome of the Paris talks
is a phased withdrawal of American
troops. Since the North Vietnamese are
being helped by the Russians and the
Chinese with equipment of the most
modern kind to the tune of an esti-
mated $5 billion a year, it is obvious
that if the South Vietnamese are to
have a chance of standing up to them
they will need similarly generous aid
in hardware.
The problem of the obsolete rifle is
already being tackled, and the regular
troops of the Vietnamese Army are in
the process of abandoning their old,
heavy, slow-firing weapons for M-16
Armalites, the standard U.S. rifle. And
the units already so equipped have
shown a marked improvement in per-
formance, so it is said. But very little
else is being done to fit out the South
Vietnamese Army with equipment to
match their opponents’ increased fire-
power. They are almost entirely with-
out heavy machine-guns, large-calibre
mortars, and recoilless rifles. They
don’t have rockets. They are pitifully
short on transport. The average Viet-
namese battalion of 700 men will have
half a dozen jeeps and three trucks
where the same American unit would
have a transport section with 100
vehicles. They are, of course, very short
on artillery and armor. Their Air
Force has 70 clapped-out old heli-
copters, which service about a third of
one °f a dozen divisions of troops, and
the Y rely heavily on the Americans for
tactical air support,
“Give us the hardware and give us
time and we will take over from the
Americans,” is the theme in Saigon.
When they speak of time, Vietnamese
leaders mean a withdrawal of American
combat troops over two or three years
and a rundown of support units extend-
ing over four or five years. During
this time the South Vietnamese Army


would be built into a force of about a
million men with a good deal of self-
sufficiency in transportation and sup-
porting arms, and would, therefore, be
able to hold its own against the North
Vietnamese.
There will, of course, be immense
problems in bringing off this sort of
de-Americanisation. With a 600,000-
man Army, there are already grave
shortages of military leaders, and the
war takes a heavy toll of veterans. It
will also mean there will be few young
men available for civilian work. But,
in the face of sustained Communist
attempts to overwhelm the country by
military force and of allied unwilling-
ness to do more, total mobilisation in
South Vietnam may be the only way for
that country to maintain its independ-
ence.
But what of the peace talks in Paris?
On previous visits I found a quite
rigid attitude toward negotiations. Let
them cease their aggression, repatriate
their northern troops, and let their
southern allies accept our generous offer
of amnesty. That was the Saigon for-
mula for peace. It was the classic tough-
minded counter-insurgency recipe as
applied by experts like Sir Robert
Thompson in the Malayan insurgency
and the Philippines leader, Magsaysay,
in the war with the Huks. But given
the realities of the Vietnam situation—
the willingness of the North to simply
keep sending troops south, the great
difficulty of providing rural security,
and the war-weariness of the U.S.—
this sort of “safe,” uncompromising line
Is no longer a real option. The South
Vietnamese have to take a gamble on
their own future by being prepared to
settle for something less than before.
(But, understandably, they do not want
the gambling done for them by the
Americans.)
They are talking scenarios these days,
trying to foresee possible ways in which
the peace talks might develop. A lot of
It is “off the record” talk, all of it
■“non-attributable,” so it is difficult to
report. And there are differences of
emphasis as between various people
In the Saigon Government. But some
sort of line on peace negotiation is
appearing. It goes roughly as follows:
every effort to “de-foreignise” the war
by negotiating a withdrawal of North
Vietnamese and American troops is
acceptable and welcome. The more the
war can be got to revert to a civil war
the better. This can best be left as a
matter of formal negotiation between
Hanoi and Washington, as at Paris at
present. The Saigon Government is
indeed best left out of this sort of
negotiation, because in formal negotia-
tion it would not want to agree that the
Americans and the North Vietnamese
be sent home on the same basis. (The
Americans were, after all, invited to
come, the North Vietnamese are, to put
It mildly, unwelcome visitors.) The
main avenue for discussion at Paris
should be such a mutual N.V.N.-U.S.
withdrawal and de-escalation. Both
sides should be forced to shift the
burden toward their indigenous allies
within South Vietnam.
The great problem, of course, is to
create the conditions where any such
mutual withdrawal and de-escalation is
enforceable. The North Vietnamese
may agree verbally, and even sign a
piece of paper, but how to ensure they
keep their word? People in the Saigon
Government are pondering this deeply,
looking for possible ways. It will have
to be some mix of measures. Many
sound highly improbable, others rather
unworkable, but they may lead to
something.
First, border inspection and insulation.
The International Control Commission,
if equipped adequately with modern
electronic sensing devices, if able to
finance some sort of undercover intel-
ligence organisation in border areas,
and if it was composed of men who
were prepared to play down their
national allegiances, might be built into
an effective inspection agency, which
would inform the world about any
breaches of a pull-back agreement. But
it would have to be a lot better than the
toothless International Control Com-
mission which arose out of the Geneva
Conference of 1954. Then there is the
thought being given to the possibility
of devising a border supervision force
with the strength to provide insulation
against the infiltration of men and sup-
plies from outside. The talk is of a
joint Asian force of combat troops from
neutral countries like India and Indo-
nesia. Japan is spoken of as a supplier
of logistic units, with some joint
Russian-American, East European-West
European financing arrangement. It is
possible to be cynical about the chances
of implementing such a scheme. It
does sound rather fanciful, but a work-
able compromise settlement may require
something novel along these lines.
Second, the possibility of a peaceful
political role has to be offered to the
Communists in the South, though this is
something emphatically not to be nego-
tiated by the Americans. Various South
Vietnamese Government leaders are
suggesting a number of concrete com-
promise moves which might at some
stage in negotiations be offered. In-
creasing numbers are prepared to take
a risk on allowing the Communist
Party full legal rights and recognition
as a legitimate political party once in-
surgency had died down. This could
be done under the cover of the latest
Communist front, the National Alliance
of Democratic and Peace Forces, rather
than the old National Liberation Front.
And there is some talk in high govern-
ment levels of allowing such a front
full rights at the next national elections.
Additionally, they talk of the pos-
sibility of allowing Party functionaries
in apeas under Communist administra-
tion to retain their powers and be
gradually absorbed into the government
administration.
But finally the compromise which is
achieved must depend on the balance
of strength of the two contending sides.
There are talks now because neither
side can see a clear-cut victory as an
immediate possibility. On our side, the
American will to continue has weak-
ened; pacification is proceeding very
slowly; indeed, most of this year will be
needed to regain the Tet losses; the
intensified war is taking a terrible toll
in life and property now (a toll several
times greater than at any other time in
the past); and the North shows no sign
of faltering in its efforts to take the
South by force. On the contrary, it is
sending vastly increased numbers of
men and guns and taking advantage of
the partial bombing halt.
On the other side there are terrible
difficulties, too. If the American war of
attrition shows few signs of weakening
the Northern war effort to the collapse
point, it has succeeded in breaking the
indigenous Southern war effort. As
recently as January, the indigenous Viet
Cong provided half the manpower of
the Communist regular units. Now they
provide only 30 percent, and continued
battles on the scale of the Tet and
post-Tet fighting will reduce them to
an insignificant force. And the rural
guerillas and urban sapper groups have
suffered terribly in both numbers and
quality, partly through the attrition of
battle but also through the need to
provide replacements in mainforce
regular units. The Communist effort
in the South has become more “foreign”"
than ours.
The current situation was envisaged
by the Communists some time ago:
“Fighting continues until the emer-
gence of a situation where both sides
are fighting indecisively; then a situ-
ation where fighting and negotiating
are conducted simultaneously may
emerge,” said General Nguyen Van
Vinh, Chairman of the Hanoi Reunifi-
cation Department, in a major speech
to the Viet Cong in late 1966. He
defined the objectives at this stage as
follows: “Fighting while negotiating is
aimed at opening another front with
a view to making the puppet army more
disintegrated, stimulating and develop-
ing the enemy’s contradictions, and
thereby making him more isolated . . .”
If this objective is to be countered as
has been the objective of simply win-
ning on the battlefield, then the South
Vietnamese will have to continue to-
show a reasonable amount of political
cohesion and a growing military
strength, and the Americans will have
to maintain the Vietnamese confidence
at the negotiations.
General Vinh did foresee a third
stage beyond the present talk-but-fight-
more phase. He called it the stage of
“real negotiations and the signing of
agreements.” But his'next sentence pro-
vides a very clear statement of a
principle which both sides have to keep
in mind: “Whether or not the war will
resume after the conclusion of agree-
ments depends upon the comparative
balance of forces. If we are capable of
dominating the adversary, the war will
break out again, and conversely.”


Labor’s
Whitlam
doubters
Gough Whitlam and his “undoubtedly loyal” Deputy, Lance Barnard
By ALAN REID
NEARLY 50 percent of the ALP’s
elite believe that however ineffective
the Gorton Liberal-Country Party Gov-
ernment may turn out to be in the
months between now and the next
Federal elections, due at the latest by
December next year, Labor has no
prospect of winning the government.
Quite a high proportion of the 50
percent are dedicated to the proposition
that the present Labor leader, Gough
Whitlam, shall not and should not.
become Prime Minister of Australia.
This was the plight of Whitlam and
his supporters before three State ALP
-conferences were held last weekend in
Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide.
Nothing that happened at any of those
conferences changed the situation sig-
nificantly. In fact, what happened at
the Victorian ALP conference merely
hardened the situation.
In some ways it is hard to put your
finger upon what basically is Labor’s
malaise. Whitlam told the Victorian
ALP conference that the differences
between the warring factions in the
ALP were not on policy nor even on
personalities. They were organisational,
But he was addressing what, for all its
politeness (it listened to him in
courteous silence and gave perfunctory
applause both before and after his
speech), was a basically hostile audi-
ence.
It consisted (as it was later to show
by voting overhelmingly, almost unani-
mously, against anything he had sug-
gested or sponsored) of supporters of
the Victorian ALP Executive, which he
has castigated in a way few Labor
Leaders have ever castigated an
executive and which he has suggested
is controlled by an “outside, secret
body” in the shape of the Trade Union
Defence Committee, a body which has
no official ALP standing, has defended
unity tickets between ALP members and
Communists in trade-union elections (a
practice outlawed by Federal ALP
decree), and is generally tolerant of the
Communist influence upon the trade-
union movement.
Organisational differences are un-
doubtedly a source of discord. Under
the regime of two former Labor
Leaders, the late Dr. Eva:tt and Mr.
Arthur Calwell, the ALP machine
achieved a degree of ascendancy over
the parliamentary Wing that changed
the former delicate balance between the
two groups. Whitlam does not like this
machine dominancy. He has tried to
change it. But he has moved without
preparation and without forethought.
He has tried to confront the naked
power of the machine with his authority,
first as Deputy Leader (when he was
Arthur Calwell’s resentful lieutenant)
and later as Leader in his own right.
In thus abandoning the indirect, slow
methods of persuasion and conversion
that former Labor Leaders (such as the
late Ben Chifley and John Curtin)
employed he has given some justifi-
cation to the claim made by Victorian
ALP secretary, William Hartley, that
he is trying to establish a presidential
autocratic system of Labor leadership,
under which the power of initiation and
control is in the Leader’s hands alone.
Naturally the ALP machine control-
lers, accustomed now to years of power
superior to that of the parliamentarians,
have fought back. They look upon the
Parliamentary Leader merely as the
first among equals.
But while organisational problems
are undoubtedly important, it is doubt-
ful whether they are as important as
personalities and policies.
On the personality side, Whitlam has
defects. He seems to have an inability
to gather round him the loyal follow-
ing which the normal political Leader
can acquire. It is hard to find out who
among the Labor parliamentarians and
ALP-machine men who support him
are his advisers.
His Deputy Leader, Lance Barnard,
is undoubtedly loyal. If Barnard had
been prepared to accept the invitation
made to him by Dr. J. F. Cairns to
run against Whitlam in the recent
leadership ballot Barnard would almost
certainly have been Labor’s parliamen-
tary Leader today. Cairns finally ran,
himself. Cairns got 32 votes compared
with Whitlam’s 38. It only needed four
persons to change their minds and
Whitlam would have been deposed. The
32 voters Cairns got would certainly


have gone to Barnard if he had stood.
They were irredeemably anti-Whitlam
votes. Barnard, a Tasmanian, w'ould
certainly have been able to get four
votes in his own right. However, Barn-
ard did not stand. But, though loyal,
he gives the impression of being loyal
to the office of Labor Leader rather
than to Whitlam as a person.
Rex Connor, a former N.S.W. State
Member, whose electorate council is
interestingly anti-Whitlam (it told
Connor that he should vote for Cairns,
not, as he did vote, for Whitlam in
the recent leadership ballot), is re-
puted to be a Labor parliamentarian
whom Whitlam frequently consults.
Tony Luchetti, who represents Chifley’s
old seat of Macquarie and w-ho was,
back in the rough and tough Lang days,
one of the youngest men ever to sit on
a N.S.W. ALP executive probably is
listened to. But once these are listed the
roll of Whitlam’s advisers starts to tail
off.
N.S.W. ALP President C. T. (Char-
ley) Oliver and N.S.W. ALP State
Secretary W. R. Colbourne are his sup-
porters and sympathetic to his view-
points, particularly to his conviction
that Labor should seek to gain power
rather than be eternally pre-occupied
with the purity of its political doctrines
(a pragamatic approach that W.A.
State Secretary F. E. (“Joe”) Cham-
berlain, strong man of the ALP Feder-
ally, and the Victorian ALP do not
share). The ALP Federal Secretary
C. S. Wyndham shares quite a number
of the Whitlam views. But a number
of the things that Whitlam does suggests
that if he gets their advice he does
not heed it too often. The mistakes
he makes are such that it is impossible
to see him producing them in consul-
tation with such old hands at
manoeuvre and tactics.
Paradoxically, a man who genuinely
seems interested in getting a Labor Gov-
ernment, even if it is led by Whitlam,
Is Cairns, the man who, in the light
of recent events, might be deemed the
least likely to go out of his way to
help Whitlam. Cairns apparently
pressed Whitlam to abandon his boy-
cott threat against Victoria and to
attend last weekend’s Victorian ALP
■conference in the interests of unity. He
also unsuccessfully pressed Whit-
lam to make some statement that would
encourage the Whitlam supporters in
Victoria, who, on the strength of Whit-
lam’s anti-Victorian declarations had
decided to boycott the conference, to
take their places when the delegates
assembled.
Some cynics argue that Cairns would
like to see a Labor Government because
the erosion of time would result in his
taking over as Prime Minister from
Whitlam. But whatever his motives he
is behaving with scrupulous propriety in
his efforts to secure a facade of unity
which would give Labor—and Whitlam
—more chance than at present appears
to be the case of fighting the next Fed-
eral elections to a successful conclusion.
But whatever organisational and per-
sonality problems are involved in
Labor’s current troubles it does seem
that policy problems, despite Mr. Whit-
lam’s claim, loom larger than anything
else. It is easier (and this might be a
pointer to Labor’s present distressed
state) to identify what the opposed
factions in the ALP are against rather
than what they support in a lineup that
is roughly N.S.W. and Tasmania versus
Victoria, Queensland, and, to a lesser
extent, South Australia and Western
Australia.
The Victorian ALP (which tends to
put its view's in a more decisive form
than its allies in Queensland, South
Australia, and Western Australia):
• Is against the involvement in Viet-
nam, reconciliation with the DLP, and
the United States-Australia alliance in
its present form.
• Is inclined to be tolerant of Com-
munism (as shown by its attitude on
the unity-ticket issue).
• Is inclined toward pacifism and sus-
picious of defence expenditure.
• Though paying lip service to the
proposition that Labor’s attraction
should extend beyond the trade-union
movement, nevertheless insists that both
Party control and control over Labor
Parliamentarians (and their selections)
should be kept in the hands of people
susceptible to trade union influence and
direction.
The N.S.W. ALP (with a consider-
able minority operating within it that
is in broad agreement with the Vic-
torian ALP):
• Accepts the Vietnam involvement
conditionally, wistfully looks forward
to the days w'hen those capable of
reconciliation who left Labor’s ranks
to join the DLP are restored to the
bosom of the ALP (thereby giving
Labor the chance of again forming
Federal and State Governments), and
is (generally) pro-American and sup-
ports the Australia-United States
alliance, maintenance of which they
believe to be essential to Australia’s
long-term future.
• Is intolerant of Communism and
Communists.
• Believes in defence expenditure.
• Believes pragmatically that Labor’s
function is to gain power so that power
can be exercised in the interests of its
supporters.
Industrially the N.S.W. ALP inclines
toward support of the arbitration sys-
tem, whereas a mounting number of
the Victorian-orientated unions favor
direct bargaining with the employers.
Of the two groups, the Right Wing
tend to be less ideological in their
approach than the Left Wing, of which
Victoria is the symbol. The N.S.W.
ALP tends to take only a perfunctory
interest in foreign affairs and to leave
such matters to the ALP’s Federal
authorities where the Left Wing has the
ascendancy. A feature of the Victorian
ALP is the fact that it expresses view's
on foreign affairs, as it has every right
to do under Party rules, passionately
and frequently. Where N.S.W. dis-
cusses wage issues, workers’ compensa-
tion, social service, and the like, it W'ill
deal with international problems.
Whitlam tried to steer the Victorian
ALP conference off international issues
last weekend. He pointed Out that
these matters were within the province
of the ALP’s Federal authorities—that
any resolution passed by the Victorian
ALP merely finished up as an item for
deliberation on an ALP Federal con-
ference’s agenda.
The Victorian conference proceeded
to ignore his insinuation that Labor
electorally would benefit from Victoria’s
silence on the subject of foreign affairs.
Conference proceeded to pass a
resolution that Australian forces in
Vietnam should be withdrawn by a
Labor Government “forthwith” a
reversion to the Calwellian policy on
which Labor fought so disastrously the
1966 Federal elections. It then started
to take away the crutch upon which the
Whitlam supporters have leaned to
claim that, despite existing Labor policy
on Vietnam, which demands withdrawal
of Australian forces unless the United
States agrees to conditions laid down by
a future Australian Labor Government,
there is no obligation upon a future
Labor Government to withdraw the
troops even if the Americans do not
accept the Australian-imposed condi-
tions.
According to the Whitlam supporters,
the section dealing with the “crucial”
nature to Australia of the Australia-
United States alliance overrides ALP
policy on withdrawal from Vietnam.
As these Whitlam supporters put the
argument, the word “crucial” is vital,
particularly as it is embodied in a plank
of the ALP platform, whereas the Viet-
nam policy is merely a conference
resolution.
The Victorian ALP conference
showed its contempt for this rather
esoteric argument by taking the pre-
liminary steps for the deletion of the
word “crucial” and further watering
down the alliance by making it contin-
gent upon the United States following
progressive policies (with the judgment
on what was considered progressive to
be made by the Australian Labor
Party). But one thing has to be realised
about the Labor Party. Though it is in
a mess, it has been in hundreds of
messes before. It has an extraordinary
resilience. It can survive troubles that
would cause a Party of lesser recuper-
ative powers to give up the ghost finally
and completely.
In the short term, however, the thing
that could decide the next elections is
not the mess that it is in, and whether
it can somehow provide a veneer of
unity before it has to face the electors,
but something that has become very
evident a significant section of
Labor’s elite not only thinks that Whit-
lam cannot win the next elections but
is increasingly dedicated to the proposi-
tion that he shall not and should not.
It is going to be interesting to see if
Whitlam can reconvert them to a con-
trary viewpoint in the relatively few
months at his disposal before he has
to lead the Party at a general election.


Why students drop out
By SANDRA HALL
ABOUT one-third of Australia’s uni-
versity students become drop-outs—■
that fashionably explicit expression for
those who leave without obtaining a
degree.
This has been going on for some
years. Academics come out in print
deploring the high failure rate at Aus-
tralian universities compared with
Britain and chiding students who enrol
merely for “a jolly good time.” (At
the moment university staff might
feel grateful that their students are
there, and not there merely to riot).
Students, equally irate, have responded
with stories about those who have to
take jobs as secretaries and gardeners,
selling encyclopedias, and working in
petrol stations in order to stay at uni-
versity.
The one-third figure was given first
in the Martin report on universities in
1964. Subsequent research by the
Commonwealth Education Depart-
ment suggests that it is fairly con-
stant. It is known that the final failure
and wastage figure lines up closely
with the failure rate for first year.
However, not a great deal is known
about why students drop out.
As matriculation demands grow
tougher, particularly in New South
Wales, where the universities are filled
with the first Wyndham Plan freshers,
there may be a decline in the number
of drop-outs. Students may be loath to
throw away places so arduously won.
Certainly people around the univer-
sities are talking with cautious awe of
the Wynd h a m
“bunnies’ ’’conscien-
tiousness. But they
are also saying that,
good as the students
are, the courses are
tough and that the
universities, by tak-
ing with unwar-
ranted seriousness
the Wynd h a m
Plan’s use of differ-
ent levels for cer-
tain subjects, are
forcing students to
abide by decisions
made at 13, when
they selected the
levels at which they
would study these
subjects. Others are
saying that some
students, tired of
their teachers’ “new
technology” talk,
have reacted against
Science in favor of
Arts. Who is to say
they won’t decide
later on that they’ve
made a mistake
and want to switch
back? In the past, immaturity and
wrong advice have frequently been
reasons for students dropping out of
choosing the wrong faculty.
One young Sydney journalist speaks
bitterly of the vocational - guidance
counselling he received after leaving
school. “At school, I’d liked English,
but I went along to the vocational-
guidance people and did some tests,
after which they told me I could do
anything, but I’d done well in the
clerical tests, so why not do account-
ancy?
“At that stage, I wasn’t very sure
of what I wanted to do, but I looked
up the ‘wanted’ ads, saw that
accountants got a lot of money and
decided to do Economics at the Uni-
versity of N.S.W.
“I failed accountancy hopelessly in
first year. I wrote poems all through
the exam. But I did two years of
Economics, then I had to get out of it,
and I went to Sydney University, where
I got an honors degree in Arts. I think
a lot of people are directed, as I was,
into the wrong faculty.”
A Sydney businessman says he studied
Arts for two years, all the time detesting
the course, before he felt strong enough
to challenge the wishes of his father,
who saw him as a gentleman grazier
with a suitable veneer of culture. And
a 21-year-old secretary in a law firm
says that, from the beginning, her short-
Tony Armstrong and Paul Comrie-Thomson on both work on the University of New
South Wales’ newspaper, “Tharunka.” Comrie-Thomson says: “The push I went
round with in first year wanted God, sex, and Vietnam; the courses just didn’t fit.”
lived university career had little chance
of success.
“I didn’t even know what I wanted
to do with a degree, beyond a vague
idea of doing social work. The whole
idea of work seemed so remote that I
didn’t really think about it. My mother
knew I wouldn’t stick to the course,, but
I said I would, so my parents went
ahead and sent me to the University of
Sydney. I went for a year, costing them
£8 a week. They could afford it, but
it was still £8 they could have spent
on something else.
“I just got bored. If I’d worked, I
wouldn’t have, but I was too lazy. At
17, I wasn’t really equipped for it,
coming straight from school. Perhaps if
I’d had a year at business college first,
learning just how dreary work and the
rest of the world could be, my attitude
would have been different, although I
don’t know.
“Sometimes I think that if I went
back to university I’d make it this time,
now that I’m older, but, in my heart, I
know that I’m too lazy, that I’d do the
same thing again.”
A survey conducted by Mrs. Madge
Dawson of the University of Sydney’s
Department of Adult Education showed
that one in ten of the women who go
to university do so to fill in time before
marriage. This may change, in New
South Wales, anyway, now that the
Wyndham students have arrived
(although Matrimony I is still a student
joke), but it’s far from being the only
romantic idea stu-
dents cherish about
university.
Some go there
expecting a place
where great minds
meet, only to find
loneliness, anony-
mity as one of
1000 students in
a draughty lecture
hall, ill - equipped
libraries, and lec-
turers who mumble.
Some academics see
lecturing as an in-
trusion into time
better spent in re-
search work, and
reveal their attitude
in dull, repetitious
lectures, unchanged
from year to year.
Paul Comrie-
Thomson, editor of
the University of
N.S.W.’s st u dent
paper, “Tha-
runka,” expresses
students’ disillusion-
ment more suc-
cinctly. “The push


[ went round with in first year wanted
God, sex, and Vietnam. And the courses
just didn’t fit. They went along to
psychology and got statistics, they went
to philosophy for beauty and truth and
got Socratic dialogues.”
Comrie-Thomson is “Tharunka’s”
first full-time editor, possible because
he has been granted a year’s scholar-
ship which supports him while he com-
pletes his term on the newspaper. Next
year he resumes his course and some-
body else takes over. On the day I
spoke to him in the “Tharunka” office,
he was with Mark Lyons, former
“Tharunka” editor now doing post-
graduate study at the Australian Nat-
ional University, Tony Armstrong and
his brother, David, two students who
work on “Tharunka.” All but Comrie-
Thomson have switched courses at some
time during their university careers.
“The schools do tend to press you
into certain faculties,” Lyons said.
“When I was at school, you did Maths,-
Physics, and Chemistry if you were in
the ‘A’ class, and a lot of people went
on to do Science, simply because they
didn’t know they’d be happier in the
humanities.
“I started doing Textile Technology,
of all things. I got through the first
year, but I didn’t like it, and by the
second year I’d drifted into the sort of
university subculture which exists. I
used to spend all my time drinking at
the pub. I lost my Commonwealth
Scholarship, but when I switched to
Arts I persuaded the Teachers’ College
people to give me a scholarship. I was
lucky, but other people haven’t been.”
Tony Armstrong agreed. “I knew a
Commerce student who hated it, and
really wanted to do Arts. He got caught
up with a horse-racing syndicate of
students and lost the money for his
fees. I dropped out for one year when
I changed from Accountancy to
Economics. There were problems at
home, and I was short of money, so I
drove a cab for a year.”
In an effort to offset the effects of
their own size and impersonal nature,'
many universities have set up student
counselling units on the campus —just
as the older British universities allot
students to a mentor.
Jim Jupp, a counsellor at the Uni-
versity of N.S.W., believes that most
students drop out because of emotional
problems as their moral views begin
to diverge sharply from their parents’
and clashes become inevitable.
“The student starts to vent his non-
middle-class opinions about the house,
and there’s conflict. Usually, when
parents are supporting a child, it’s
implicit that he toe the line, and the
student resents this. So they fight
about’ him coming in late and some-
times about him wanting to go and live
with his girlfriend.
“Other students drop out because
they see the university as a degree
factory or as a big, impersonal place
where they don’t get the help they
need. Most of the students who come
to see me aren’t introverts, but if you
are introverted you can become an out-
cast at university. There’s so much
contrast between you and the others
who are having a good time.”
Architecture seems to be a faculty
especially susceptible to undergraduates’
misapprehensions.
Jim Jupp talks about Architecture
students who have enrolled, regarding
the subject as more of a science than
an art, found it’s not, then become
frustrated because they couldn’t reach
the creative level Architecture requires.
But Richard Dennison, who now does
promotional work for a newspaper,
failed to find what he wanted in his
University of Sydney Architecture course
practical application of Art.
“Basically, I was interested in build-
ing and in Art, and Architecture, I
thought, would combine both. But it
was different from the sort of thing I’d
imagined, with too much physics and
maths. I didn’t want to be a draughts-
man for the rest of my life, and it
quickly lost its lustre. I did it for
six months, then wfent into journalism,
because the main thing I wanted to do
was get into something creative.”
If immaturity is a recurrent reason
for dropping out, lack of money is an-
other one —and it’s a cause Common-
wealth Scholarships have done little or
nothing to remedy. A scholarship
living allowance is usually awarded to
a student in accordance with a strict
means test based on family income,
something which doesn’t help many
students who are supporting them-
selves.
Eighteen months ago, Sue Vockenson
was a year away from an honors de-
gree in Philosophy, now she’s resigned
to the fact that she’ll never have it.
Like so many other students, her uni-
versity career had a false start —she
went into Science from school, allowed
entry even though she had never studied
physics and chemistry (“People do pass
with no knowledge of them—but it’s
difficult, to say the least”).
After she failed her first year, she
took up a Teachers’ College Scholar-
ship, did two years of college, then
taught while studying Arts at the Uni-
versity of Sydney in the evening. After
two years of this, she decided to try for
entry into the honors course in Philo-
sophy, although she knew she’d have to
become a full-time student to succeed.
“I didn’t try to get a scholarship, be-
cause the student advisers told me I
wouldn’t be able to. I have no father,
but my mother’s pension, added to her
salary, puts her out of the Means Test
limit, and they said this would make
me ineligible—even though I’m not liv-
ing at home.
“So I borrowed money from the SRC
to do it. Well, I got into the honors
course and applied for and got a
scholarship for the next year. But no
living allowance.
“To get that, I would have had to
prove I’d been self-supporting for the
past five years. I could prove it for
three years two years of teaching,
a year as a full-time student. But they
wouldn’t believe that I’d got myself
through Teachers’ College on only the
scholarship and coaching jobs. They
said, ‘You can’t tell me that you sup-
ported yourself on a scholarship allow-
ance it’s too small.’ Yet that’s all
they were offering me.
“Anyway, I couldn’t go on with the
honors course. Work during the long
vacation would only have paid the last
year’s debts and I wouldn’t have
passed if I’d gone out to work at nights,
so I’m completing my pass course at
night. I’ve gone back to teaching during
the day.
“Yes, I regret it. An honors degree
would have meant a much better job.
And the experience has made me feel
very bitter about the Commonwealth
Scholarship people.”
When university turns into a night-
marish obstacle course like that, the
univei'sities and the Government have
only themselves to blame for the loss of
bright students who give the whole thing
up for easier and quicker paths to
success outside academe. Often, the
job taken on as a means toward a
degree becomes interesting enough to
supersede it and become an end in
itself.
At “Tharunka,” they estimate that
a large percentage of Arts drop-outs find
their way into newspapers and the
ABC (“the things that still have the
romantic pull”), while ex-Commerce
students settle in the Public Service. “Or
you might swallow your pride and go
to work in a bank or insurance office.”
Then there are the young spokes-
men for “this happening world,” the
spontaneity disciples to whom the
printed word is anathema, and anything
they themselves haven’t experienced is
to be distrusted. So far it’s a fringe
movement which has organised a few
sudden, though short-lived, “happen-
ings,” but its McLuhan-versed exponents
are adamant that they’ve tried univer-
sity and found it a non-event. Judy
Gemes, an Arts drop-out who preferred
NIDA and life at Grotowski’s experi-
mental theatre in Poland, puts it this
way: “There’s a discrepancy between
the written word and the way things
actually are. All you’re getting is some-
body else’s version of a thing, and you
can do that just as well by yourself.
“Also, these courses are based on the
intellectual concepts of logic and
coherence, which cut out a lot of
things you can understand just by see-
ing.”
It is doubtful whether this year’s
Wyndham fresher, dashing between lec-
ture hall and library with bulging brief-
case, has time for abstractions like these,
and you could answer, “I hope not.
They won’t help him to get a degree,
will they?” Perhaps not, but it is some-
how saddening that those idealistic
illusions about a meeting place of 'the
minds have to be discarded with such
speed and that the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment can let so many students drop
out because of money worries and
academic pressure.


FORUM
SHOULD WE SCRAP
THE CMF?
By an ex-officer
IT MAY seem paradoxical to question
the existence of the CMF when we
are still recovering from the sudden
dream of an “Israeli-type” army, but
it is, nevertheless, sensible to ask: Do
we need the CMF at all?
In the kind of role our Army has at
present, the answer would seem, fairly
obviously, to be “no.” To meet our
commitments overseas in limited insur-
gency situations, or in semi-training
roles, the CMF is of no use to us. What
is needed in the role our Army has
at present is an enlargement of the
Regular Army, with, if necessary, an
enlargement of its National Service in-
take. If we were not to think of the
future at all, it would clearly be better
to scrap the CMF and put the money
into raising a few more regular units.
But the need to keep the CMF is, of
course, not purely as a decoration. The
assumption is and it is a highly
necessary one that, as well as its
regular units, the Australian Army
needs a reserve, so that if, for some
reason or other, a quick expansion of
our overseas forces is needed, then the
CMF can be put into operation and
provide whatever is required.
Unfortunately, there is very consider-
able doubt as to whether the CMF
could serve this purpose. Most of the
men in it have not really been trained.
They are weekend and two-week annual
camp soldiers. It seems likely that fre-
quently they are little more efficient or
no more efficient than school cadets.
If they had to go into active service it
would take almost as long to bring them
up to battle training as it may take to
train raw recruits for the Regular
Army.
There are also other disabilities, be-
yond training. Whether it really mat-
ters that some of the present increase
in the strength of the CMF has come
from Vietnam draft-dodgers would be
found out only if serious training be-
gan, although it is doubtful if they make
the very best basis for a reserve army.
But even more to the point is that
many men in the CMF are in what
would be “reserved occupations” and
others would have sound compassionate
grounds for not being sent away. In
other words, each CMF unit, if it were
activated, would at once lose a number
of its personnel in a way that would
lessen the advantages, even from a
training point of view, of coherence and
familiarity.
In addition, very few CMF officers
have had recent operational experi-
ence. For example, if a man served in
World War II and was 21 in 1945 (after
very brief junior experience) he is now
43 or 44. His experience is 23 years old
and soon he must be retired anyway.
By and large the CMF is operationally
a virgin, except for a few “old and
bolds” whose operational service was
inevitably at junior level. Even some
unit commanders have had no opera-
tional experience. It will not be long
before no one in the CMF has had
operational experience.
What all of this means is that to
keep the CMF in its present form, as a
reserve army ready for operational
employment, is little better than start-
ing from scratch.
What should be done? Without uni-
versal National Service there seem two
The Bulletin invites the expression of
views which need not necessarily be
its own —on Australian defence policy
alternatives:— (1) Scrap the CMF and
increase the Regular Army. (2) Re-
organise the CMF.
The answer may lie in a combination
of both alternatives. This would envis-
age a reorganisation along these lines:
1. The rank and file of the CMF
would come from National Servicemen
who were replaced on the CMF Reserve
after their two years’ regular service.
This would mean that Australia would
have a Reserve Army in which the
rank and file and the junior officers
would be thoroughly trained.
2. All appointments including and
above the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel
would be filled by Regular Army
officers. (There would be a compensa-
tory arrangement in which suitable and
ambitious CMF junior officers could, if
they wished, join the Regular Army.)
This would mean that senior officers
would all be regulars who were opera-
CMF trainees . .. school-cadet
efficiency?
tionally experienced in war and trained
through staff college, etc.
There would also be a spin-off advan-
tage in this arrangement. At present,
many able regulars are retired at 47.
This early retirement is one of the
major causes for the unattractiveness
of army careers. If the opportunities
were increased for the promotion of
Regular officers, this would help officer-
recruiting into the Regular Army.
3. The present voluntary CMF would
be scrapped. The only way to volunteer
for the CMF would be to volunteer
first for National Service.
To carry out such drastic changes
would really involve scrapping the CMF
as it now stands and keeping little
more than the name, for sentiment’s
sake. It would become, instead, a truly
trained force of reservists, whose skills
were refreshed by weekend and annual
camp training on the present CMF
basis, and in similar units, with an infra-
structure of Regular officers in the key
jobs. It would be in action only a short
time after mobilisation. To fit into this
pattern, National Servicemen would be
recruited, as far as possible on an area
basis, to serve in a “parent” regular
unit, then return after National Service
to an affiliated area reserve unit.
Obviously, the principal objection
perhaps the only real objection is
the gross unfairness of such a proposal.
As it is now, some young men are
pressed into service by the results of a
lottery, while the rest do nothing. To
pass them into a reserve with obliga-
tions of weekend and annual camp
training, and with the possibility of
late mobilisation, would extend this in-
justice to an extent that the community
might resist more seriously than it
resisted the original reintroduction of
conscription. There is little doubt that
at present, in effect, Australia is in
the serious position of not having a
reserve army, and that such a proposal
would give us one. But to attempt to
compensate for its unfairness it would
be necessary to put up an extremely
lavish GI Bill, with increased war-
service home loans, tertiary education
grants, pension schemes, health schemes,
and so forth, so that in entering
National Service a young man would
enter a new elite.




Canada’s crisis
of identity
BY EDMOND TAYLOR
THE HEAD-ON confrontation be-
tween the new Prime Minister, Pierre
Trudeau, and Quebec’s French-speaking
nationalists gives exceptional signi-
ficance to Canada’s national elections
in two weeks’ time, for on the outcome
rests not merely the fate of the Federal
Government in Ottawa but perhaps the
country’s identity as a nation. After
sending Parliament packing immedi-
ately on assuming office two months
ago, 46-year-old Trudeau gambled
boldly on defeat of the separatists’
ambitions at the polls on June 25, but
in the atmosphere of constitutional crisis
in which the elections have been fought,
with Ottawa confident of averting
Quebec secession, and the secessionists
equally confident of eventually achiev-
ing a bloodless divorce, there are dis-
turbing implications for Canada’s future.
When the time comes, if it ever
does, to resolve the constitutional
crisis, the formal decisions, whether by
compromise or secession, will be taken
in Ottawa and Quebec. But it is a
third city, Montreal, the nearest thing
Canada has to a national metropolis,
that will largely determine whether they
will work. In a sense, it is in this
cosmopolitan, extensively bilingual, too-
fast-growing agglomeration of more
than 2.5 million inhabitants at the foot
of the St. Lawrence Seaway that the
really vital patterns of Canadian, per-
haps even of North American, destiny
are being forged.
French is the mother tongue of only
about two-thirds of Montreal’s popu-
lation. Some ten percent of the Mon-
trealers are relatively recent immigrants
from all over Europe, who mostly pre-
fer to learn English, and 20 percent
are of English-speaking stock, and are
often unable or reluctant to speak any-
thing else.
The city, Canada’s largest, concen-
trates in its metropolitan area roughly
40 percent of Quebec Province’s total
population (5,744,000 in 1966). Natu-
rally, most of the writers, scholars,
scientists, artists, dramatists, and
journalists who keep French culture
flourishing in North America live in
Montreal, and a large part of Quebec’s
working-class finds (or at least seeks)
its livelihood here.
But Montreal is Canada’s, not just
Quebec’s, great cultural and economic
centre: McGill matches the predomin-
antly French University of Montreal,
as the Montreal “Star” matches “La
Press” and “Le Devoir”; the city is
the home of several eminent French-
and English-language novelists. It is,
likewise, Canada’s chief commercial
and financial centre, dominated by
English-Canadian capital and mana-
gerial talent. Its Rue St. Jacques, in
i'ts more familiar Anglicised version as
St. James Street, has some of the same
connotations in Canada that Wall
Street has in the United States. Any
formal separation of Quebec from
Canada that economically divorced the
two major ethnic communities in Mon-
treal would be a disaster for Canada as
a whole, but a catastrophe for Quebec.
Already the blight of what elsewhere
in Canada is a relatively mild economic
recession lies heavy on Quebec the
provincial unemployment rate is
slightly higher than the national rate of
4.1 and especially on the city of
Montreal, where it is aggravated by
fears of political upheaval.
Montreal is thus, in terms of eco-
nomic logic and of the Canadian
people’s welfare generally, the immov-
able object upon which all dreams of
Quebec ultranationalism must shatter.
Unfortunately, it is at the same time
among the main generators of social
tensions that tend to give these dreams
a revolutionary and, perhaps, ultimately
irresistible force.
Like most North American cities,
U.S. or Canadian, Montreal exemplifies
the social, and therefore, in the end,
political, chaos generated by the rapid
and unplanned urbanisation of what
only a few decades ago was a pre-
dominantly rural or small-town society.
Accompanying the social strains and
frustrations that stem directly from
headlong urbanisation in Quebec, there
is the psychological upheaval provoked
by what used to be called “the Quiet
Revolution” here, which recently has
been getting out of hand. All the
symptoms of moral and cultural
disarray that are manifest in the United
States from the flower children to
the mindless violence of the gang-
rape hoodlums on motor-cycles, from
pot to pornography occur in
Quebec, but here they stir up more
commotion because they have erupted
more suddenly. In the past five years, a
young Quebec politician-intellectual
told me, the number of practising
Catholics in the Province has declined
by half.
A real crisis of authority has devel-
oped in the home, in public life, in
offices, in schools, and in the Church.
Quebec separatism is a political expres-
sion of the general trend. Up to
now it has not fired the imagination
of the masses, but in the atmosphere of
moral and social revolution that pre-
vails here it could turn rapidly into
both a powerful and a blindly irra-
tional political force.
Some of the more far-reaching geo-
political implications of Quebec
separatism were called to my attention
during a lively four-hour discussion with
a group of politically active and
nationalist-oriented F rench-Canadian
university students in a cellar apart-
ment in Verdun, a middle-class suburb
of Montreal. Only one of the students
was an all-out revolutionary, but his
extremism made up for the relative
moderation of the others. My host
probably summed up the consensus in
the room, and perhaps in the French-
Canadian population of Quebec, when
he said to me, “At heart we’re all sep-
aratists, but most of us realise that you
have to live with economic realities,
too.”
“I’m glad to see that at least you’re
one Canadian who isn’t obsessed by the
U.S. Marines,” I remarked to the fire-
brand, alluding to a widely expressed
wish-fear, or fear-wish, among Can-
adians, both English- and French-
speaking, who believed that Quebec’s
secession if it ever comes to that
will have to be stopped by force, but
who are seemingly not prepared to use
Canadian force to stop it. “Oh,. I don’t
doubt they will threaten to send in their
Marines if we declare our independ-
ence,” he answered cheerfully. “But all
we have to do is to announce that we’ll
sink a ship in the St. Lawrence, and
block it for good, and they’ll march
home again in a hurry. If they didn’t,
we’d get arms from Cuba, and launch
guerilla warfare and don’t forget the
30 million anti-colonialist Negroes in
the United States, not to mention the
French-Canadians in New England,
who will help us turn the whole con-
tinent into another Vietnam.”
The other students jeered at their
friend’s somewhat surrealist mathe-
matics and strategy, and I realised that
he reflected the thinking of only a
minority within a minority. All the
same, this talk gave me a jolt.
Then, back in Montreal, I was
startled to find part of the local Press
cheering because the city’s port
claimed to be the world’s largest inland
one was being “saved” by the Soviet
merchant marine from economic star-
vation. Owing to chronic pilfering and
labor difficulties, a growing number of
shipping lines have been forced to drop
Montreal from their sailing schedules;
for a while last winter there was even
talk that the port might have to close
down indefinitely. Fortunately, the
strongly nationalist weekly “La Patrie”
reported, Soviet vessels, denied access to
U.S. ports because of the draconian
restrictions imposed on them, were
steadily stepping up their visits to % Mon-
treal, carrying cargo not only to and
from the Soviet Union but many Euro-
pean ports as well.
While the developing Soviet maritime
presence in the St. Lawrence under-
scores some of the disturbing long-range
implications of Quebec separatism, there
are more immediate subjects of con-
cern in case Quebec eventually does try
to secede from the confederation. Most
A bowler-hat salute to the crowd from
Canada’s Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau
English-speaking Canadians, including
Federal officials in Ottawa, seem to rule
out the use or threat of force to avert
secession. Except for a few small under-
ground groups in Quebec, the French-
speaking separatists on their side insist
they are confident of being able to
achieve their goal by legal and non-
violent methods.
Given the pragmatism for which
French- and English-speaking Canadians
are equally noted, a non-violent divorce
by mutual agreement is certainly
imaginable. The more concretely one
tries to envisage its consequences, how-
ever, the more unpredictable and re-
doubtable they seem. “The day
Quebec declares for independence,” a
former MP from British Columbia re-
marked to me, “we’re going to separate
from the rest of Canada and join the
United States. I wouldn’t be surprised
if the prairie provinces followed suit.”
To add to the general confusion, accord-
ing to one foreign observer I interviewed
in Ottawa, if Quebec secedes from the
rest of Canada the French-speaking but
strongly federalist-minded Creditistes
(dissident Social Credit adherents) in
the Province’s north-west constituencies
are very likely to secede from Quebec.
The worst possibilities of serious
trouble, however, are probably in Mon-
treal, where some of the English-
speaking residents are as extreme in
their way as the French-Canadian
separatist crackpots. A rather mysterious
anti-separatist organisation called the
Vigilants of Canada is already quite
active, and Richard Lord, the English-
speaking vice-president of the Quebec
Liberal Federation, speaking a few
weeks ago at a veterans’ club, warned
French-speaking Quebeckers that in
case of secession the English Canadians
would hold on to Montreal, or at least
its business area and upper-class sub-
urbs. “You do what you want with the
farmlands and whatever else you have,”
he told the French Canadians.
Apart from the evident danger of
economic chaos and the far from neg-
ligible risks of eventual civil war in-
herent in the Canadian crisis, there is
another hazard from the U.S. point of
view: the irresponsibly anti-capitalist,
anti-American, pro-Castro, and crypto-
Gaullist orientation of many Quebec
separatists. Probably none of these ad-
jectives apply to Quebec Premier
Daniel Johnson and what seems to be
the dominant faction in his govern-
ment. But then, the conservative
nationalists presently in power in
Quebec are not separatists or don’t
admit it to themselves if they are
despite what some Ottawa officials
consider their infuriating addiction to
double-talk.
With the apparent polarisation of
French-Canadian opinion in Quebec
provoked by Trudeau’s personality and
strong federalist policy, however, it is
the avowedly separatist leader Rene
Levesque, rather than Daniel Johnson,
who seems to be emerging as the ulti-
mate standard-bearer of Quebec
nationalism, and Levesque’s views on
foreign policy are highly ambiguous.
“Canada is a miserable little satel-
lite,” Levesque told 3500 wildly cheer-
ing Montreal separatists at a meeting
announcing the conversion of his
Sovereignty Association Movement into
a mass political party that he hopes will
attract all Quebec separatists or poten-
tial separatists. It was characteristic of
him that he did not spell out whom or
what Canada was a satellite of. Though
acknowledged by even his enemies to
be a man of absolute personal integrity
and selfless dedication to his political
ideal, Levesque rivals the late Joseph
McCarthy, if not Joseph Goebbels, in
the arts of demagoguery. He is not a
spellbinder, but he has a knack of
making the complex sound childishly
simple, the hazardous safe, and the
unbelievable plausible.
Toward his English-speaking fellow
Canadians, Levesque professes the
friendliest sentiments. He admits that
for the time being many of them do not
appear enthusiastic about his formula
for converting Canada into an economic
union between two sovereign nations,
but he is convinced that since they are
a reasonable and pragmatic people
they will eventually accept it as prefer-
able to a total rupture. Consequently,
there will be no bloodshed, no bitter-
ness, no economic upheavals. Everything
will be done peaceably and democrati-
cally.
If Quebec could count on a perman-
ently “unstable Federal Government
with a Parliament that looks like a
nuthouse” (Levesque’s characterisation)
in Ottawa, his expectations might prove
justified. With a strong-willed, tough,
and combative Prime Minister, such as
Trudeau promises to be, backed by a
solid and docile majority in the Federal
Parliament, it might be another story.
Both the chances of Canada’s survival
and the risks of a violent explosion
have increased since Trudeau replaced
Lester Pearson. The unpredictable
element for the determination of the
immediate future is the reaction of
Canadian youth, especially in Quebec,
where the voting age is 18, to the rival
causes that seek to enlist it.


The Philippines-Malaysia
A new confrontation?
OVER THE LAST two months rela-
tions between Malaysia and the Philip-
pines have got so much worse that
diplomatic relations could again be
broken between the two countries as
they were in 1963. Even a “confronta-
tion” (of sorts) is possible. True, as for
Vietnam and Nigeria, “peace talks”
have been arranged. Belatedly, mainly
as a result of Filipino procrastination,
officials of the two countries will meet
in Bangkok on June 17 to discuss the
Philippines’ claim to Sabah, now part
of Eastern Malaysia. But, as in the
Vietnamese and Nigerian confabula-
tions, the only hope of anything emerg-
ing quickly from such talks lies in one
side giving much more than the other.
Ex-Vice-President, now Senator,
Emmanuel Pelaez, of the Philippines,
has well described this reality. “It will
be very difficult for either side,” he says,
“to come up with a solution in Bang-
kok.” Unwittingly, perhaps, the Senator,
who led the Filipino delegation to
London in 1962 to push the claim for
Sabah with the British, went on in a
recent televised interview to indicate
the “very difficult” was the virtually
impossible.
On the other hand, Pelaez saw sub-
mitting the dispute to a higher authority
as the only way out, believing recourse
to the International Court of Justice at
The Hague would be “the best forum
for airing the dispute.” This has long
been the official Filipino viewpoint, but
Malaysia will probably continue to
reject it. The only “higher authority”
they might agree to consult would be
an appointed “arbitrator” (Thais are
good at this), who would save the
Filipinos’ face by conducting yet another
“investigation” into Sabah’s desires only
to pronounce, as prearranged, that it
wished to stay in Malaysia. But all the
indications are that the Filipinos would
reject such a “solution.” Not sur-
prisingly, therefore, Malaysian Prime
Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman has
said that “there should be no bad feel-
ings or rancor on the part of the
Philippines if the Bangkok talks break
down.” Unhappily, it is almost certain
they will, conceivably with a break in
relations following. Already the sugges-
tion has appeared in the Manila Press,
quoting Foreign Office sources, that
Tunku’s statement dooms the talks in
advance.
The basic positions of the two coun-
tries are, of course, not new. For Kuala
Lumpur, the two ascertainments of the
Sabahan will first, in 1963, by the
UN, secondly, in last year’s general
election in the State are sufficient as
demonstrations of where sovereignty
lies, and is desired to lie. Recourse to
the International Court would take
years, prolonging the uncertainty when
the Sabahan electorate has declared its
certainty. While there is felt to be no
obligation or need for a long-winded
lawsuit, there is also the practical com-
pulsion to reject it, since Sabah leaders
would view acceptance of the Inter-
national Court as indicative of a “sell-
out” mentality in the Malaysian capital.
For the Filipinos, on the other hand,
their Sabah claim is essentially, though
not exclusively, a legal one, though in
one aspect it would still appear “illegal.”
The Philippines Constitution lays down
the territorial limits of the country, the
A mutiny on Corregidor Island last March deepened the Sabah crisis. The mutineers
were claimed to be Filipino guerillas in training to enforce the Sabah claim
ones the Americans and the British
decided upon in the Colonial period.
All of which is a reminder of the
essence of the Malaysia-Philippines im-
passe. The Filipinos are rejecting the
Colonial past. The Malaysians are in-
sisting that the Colonial period actually
happened, like it or not.
In this there is a similarity with the
Sino-Indian border dispute. Like the
Filipinos, the Chinese rejected the
borders set by old imperialists, such as
Macmahon. New Delhi, like Kuala
Lumpur, rejects the idea that to settle
disputes or borders one takes recourse
to distant history. After all, how far
back should one go? The Filipinos
assert that the Sultan of Sulu leased,
not ceded, North Borneo to Messrs.
Overbeck and Dent. If the Malaysians
wanted to play them at this game they
might well, with good legal arguments,
point out that the two-thirds of Sabah
(plus, never let it be forgotten, sixty
square miles of Indonesia) now claimed
by the Filipinos as theirs (and also,
variously and separately, by the Sultan’s
descendants and heirs) were once
“leased” by the Sultan of Brunei to
the Sultan of Sulu.
But then the Malaysians have no
wish to open the legal-historical Pan-
dora’s box in the first place. To the
contrary, stripped to the bone their
case is that East and West Malaysia
share a common heritage of British
rule, and institutions, which brought
them together in federation, a process
now demonstrably classifiable as self-
determination. Malaysian acceptance of
a British past is opposed by (partial)
Filipino rejection of their American
tutelage. The “lease” of Saßah is seen
by those who espouse the claim not
infrequently the professional, and
amateur, anti-Americans as part of
the process whereby the U.S. “sold us
short.” The constitution, for example,
is for some an “American imposition.”
No doubt at the Constitutional
Assembly, now scheduled for 1971, some
voices will demand that the nation’s
borders be differently defined. Equally,
in all the hullabaloo created recently
over the Sabah claim, it is possible to
detect that those who espouse it are
doing so in the (vain) hope it will
help end the Filipino image of being
“brown Americans.”
It was the suggestions in March that
the Filipinos were training insurgents
for Sabah at a secret camp in Cor-
regidor that produced the present crisis.
It has become rather too obvious that
the Filipinos may well try to guerillarise
the Sabah claim and that President
Marcos is far from being inclined to
clamp the claim down, as the Malay-
sians once fondly hoped.
It was ex-President Macapagal who
got the Filipino claim going, before and


By HARVEY STOCKWIN
during his Presidency, initially as a
result of obtaining the minute Turtle
Islands back from the British in 1946.
Marcos assumed power in 1966 and
initially was more concerned with mak-
ing relations more normal, for which he
has been bitterly criticised. “Recogni-
tion of Malaysia,” Filipinos argue, “was
the one stick with which we could have
obtained satisfaction over our claim,”
little realising that one wave of the
stick and the Malaysians would have
told them what to do with their recogni-
tion. In point of fact, the probability
is that Marcos was then more concerned
North Borneo made its feeling clear
to then-President Macapagal in 1963
to obtain the Asian Development Bank
headquarters in Manila, and he secured
Malaysia’s vote for that end in exchange
for normalisation, with the Sabah claim
talks left pending. Similarly, Marcos
initially was more concerned to reach
agreement with Malaysia on the
“smuggling” that goes on into the
southern Philippines from Sabah. An
agreement was signed last year, but
only after a last-minute wrangle when
the Filipinos woke up to the fact that
references in it to the “border” might
imply abdication of their claim. The
Malaysians were annoyed but agreed
that no such references would prejudice
the peaceful settlement of the claim.
The Filipino President was not, how-
ever, willing to send Filipino observers
to the Sabah election earlier in the
year, thereby passing up the best
opportunity for “burying” the claim.
The Indonesians, after all, had ended
their confrontation by accepting the
next elections in Sabah and Sarawak
as reaffirmations of the popular will.
The Filipinos could have done likewise.
Marcos was going to send observers,
as did the Indonesians and others, but
changed his mind at the last minute.
Some rather unintelligent Filipino
intelligence operatives arrived instead,
though whether at Marcos’ bidding is
not known.
In retrospect it appears unlikely
that Marcos ever intended to drop the
claim and that the Malaysians were
naive to hope that he would. Their
hope died hard, however, and over the
election and the non-sending of
observers they still gave him the benefit
of the doubt. It was, after all, election
year in the Philippines once again.
Perhaps Marcos could not risk
abandoning the claim at such a time?
Perhaps. One may now equally ask,
had he already decided that a judicious
amount of violence “spontaneously”
created in Sabah would assist the claim?
Certainly the suspicion must have
dawned upon the Malaysians before
Marcos’ “goodwill” visit to Malaysia
in January this year. By then they
already knew about the “secret camp”
for training “special forces,” first
located at Simunul, a Filipino island
near Sabah, later moved to Corregidor.
Once the disclosures over the “mutiny”
brought the camp into the open, with
all its attendant revelations and allega-"
tions, the goodwill finally vanished, the
suspicions and attitudes hardened. The
Corregidor affair was Marcos’ last
chance to act as a statesman, not as a
Filipino politician, and polish off the
Sabah claim once and for all. All he
had to do was to disown knowledge of
the camp, point out the damage those
responsible for it had done to regional
relations, and insist that ASEAN’s
development and presidential respon-
sibility (and credibility) came before
the Sabah claim or before Filipino
pride, real or imagined. Instead, Marcos
allowed the claim, and other points of
Malaysian-Filipino irritation, to be
exacerbated. The President, no doubt
calculating, as do many of the espousers
of the claim to Sabah, that Sabah was
ripe for the plucking, produced a zig-
zag of various improbable excuses, thus
destroying any lingering faith in
Malaysia in his good intentions.
The Sabah issue has been strongly
revived in the wake of the secret camp
exposure, and Filipino “pride” has been
aroused at the thought of Malaysian
“obstinacy” and “arrogance.” So much
so that the question now arises whether
Marcos will use it as Sukarno used
confrontation to turn away domestic
pressures. In the Philippines this would
not be easy. The whole affair, like the
row over Japanese trading firms, has
probably hurt Marcos politically at a
time when, traditionally, such hurt
eventually precludes the re-election that
has eluded every Filipino President so
far. The same critical voices which sus-
tain the shrill Manila political furore,
and have put the President “under
siege,” while they themselves have given
the Sabah-claim issue the momentum it
now possesses, would make it difficult
for Marcos, or anyone else, to divert
the attention toward a “confrontation
with ambitious and insincere nations,”
to use Marcos’ own words.
Yet the signs are there. There were
widespread reports recently in the
Manila Press that the Marcos Adminis-
tration had decided to abandon its “con-
ciliatory” (sic) policy toward Malaysia.
According to the Manila “Bulletin”
there will be a “complete overhaul”
and the new policy will have “maxi-
mum military and political content.”
The Manila “Chronicle” put it more
colorfully. “On our relations with
Malaysia the hawks have won over the
doves . . . the victory of the hawks is
not surprising, of course, for while Sec-
retary of Foreign Affairs Narciso Ramos
is the leading dove, President Marcos
himself is the leading hawk,” reported
one columnist. He also quoted “a top
official” as saying the Administration
“would take a hard line instead of its
policy of accommodation” toward
Malaysia.
These reports followed Marcos’
address to the 33rd foundation day
anniversary of the Philippine Air Force,
at which the President said the Philip-
pines “must on our own develop a
military capability that will meet any
abrupt situation.” He invoked the “Fili-
pino sense of nationhood” which “has
been challenged by certain develop-
ments in our part of the world.” Marcos
went on to stress that since “the ques-
tion of national honor and dignity is an
integral part of the problem of national
security ... I, as your commander-
in-chief, shall not permit the national
honor to be belittled by any other
nation.”
Meaningless? Perhaps. But Marcos
must realise that “national honor” is a
phrase capable of -excusing ultimate
stalemate, especially as Malaysia cannot
but feel her honor is likewise at stake.
Not that the Malaysians will be caught
napping. Well before this speech the
organisation of vigilante corps, home
guard forces, and National Service
registration had got under way in
Sabah. Provocation? Scarcely. What else
can the Malaysians do but conclude
that, even as the verbal dialogue in
Manila has considerably helped in bring-
ing about the present unhappy situa-
tion, so, too, the increasingly hostile
words may, willy-nilly, create a more
violent reality?
For the Malaysians any formula
which casts doubt on Sabah’s status is
unacceptable. For the Filipinos any
formula which solidifies Sabah’s status
is unacceptable. So?

BUSINESS
AND ECONOMY
A last stand against the Tariff
Board’s “classification” plans
THERE WAS A CURIOUS turn of
events in the continuing tariff discussion
last week. Parliament presented the
fascinating spectacle of the Labor Party
returning to the protectionist attitudes
of four or five years ago, and of Coun-
try Party members playing the role ol
liberal free-traders.
This odd situation has occurred as a
result of an intense campaign mounted
by the Chamber of Manufactures to
.get the Commonwealth Government to
condemn the Tariff Board’s proposal to
publish a classification of industries
according to the tariff protection they
are proceeding. It announced this ten
months ago in its 1967 annual report.
The highly protectionist Chamber of
Manufactures condemned it at the time
and the Minister for Trade, Mr. Mc-
Ewen, expressed mild reservations.
Little more was heard until this year.
ACMA had evidently forgotten the
matter.
But since then its campaign has
gradually mounted in strength. Press
releases all in the familiar format,
typed, roneoed, and worded in virtually
Identical ACMA manner but with the
names of different individuals and
manufacturing groups, have begun to
appear several times a week in the
pigeon-holes of the Parliamentary Press
Gallery. At the same time the lobbying
of Parliamentarians has built up. A
letter-writing and telegramming cam-
paign has been launched and many
MPs approached by industry represen-
tatives.
They have had most success with the
Labor Party, evidently, because it was
they who responded in Parliament.
They echoed the ACMA line that the
classification could demoralise sections
of industry.
Mr. McEwen’s reaction and that of
his Country Party colleagues has been
very interesting. They all agreed that
there could be potential trouble, and
said they were sure the Tariff Board,
being a responsible body, would take
into account the reservations expressed
about the classification. But they then
stressed the independence of the Tariff
Board and made it perfectly clear that
they were not going to raise a finger to
stop the classification.
Mr. Holten (CP) was firmest on this:
“The fact is that neither the Govern-
ment nor the Minister has the statutory
authority to prevent the Tariff Board
from taking its proposed action. Let
everyone be quite clear that the
Minister does not have the authority
to prevent the Tariff Board from acting
as it says in its (last) annual report it
will act.”
Since June last year, the Board has
had a high-powered team of about a
dozen economists and accountants in
McEwen
Rattigan
what is called the Development Section
working on the classification. It is
nearing completion.
Tariff Board Chairman Alf Rattigan
-—recently reconfirmed in his position
for another five years —is quite con-
vinced of the necessity for pursuing the
classification and nothing can turn him
from it. So the campaign would appear
to be one of those futile exercises which
lobby groups so often launch simply to
justify themselves to their members.
There is a rather obvious inconsis-
tency in what the ACMA campaigners
say. On the one hand they claim that
the mere publication of a classification
is going to cause panic in sections of
industry. On the other hand, at the
same time, they stress that the Tariff
Board is a mere advisory body.
It is true that once its classification
is made, the Board may decide to con-
centrate its inquiries on industries which
are classified as in the heavy-protection
category. It may not be able to find
good reasons for maintaining that high
protection. It may recommend reduced
protection. But it is only an advisory
body and it can do no more than
recommend.
Whether the tariff actually goes down
in accordance with the Tariff Board’s
recommendations will depend on the
Government alone. The Tariff Board
by itself cannot set tariff levels and so
cannot affect the prosperity of any in-
dustry one way or the other. So where
are the grounds far anyone to panic
at this stage?
Another point is that the Tariff
Board’s inquiries will take a consider-
able time and the future tariff levels
will be only one of a number of factors
affecting the profitability of firms. The
profitability of some will be improved,
notably low-cost viable firms, if the
Government accepts the Tariff Board
principles. The profitability of others,
generally high-cost, will be weakened.
The fact that some firms will be
better off, some worse off, as a result
of tariff changes, is something which
has been happening since tariffs were
first imposed. The real difference in
future will be that tariff-making will
again assuming the Government
accepts Board recommendations have
a certain degree of predictability in the
future. High-cost industries will gener
ally expect to have their tariffs knocked
down somewhat; medium-cost in-
dustries will be able to plan ahead on
the fair expectation that there will not
be much change in the protection they
receive; low-cost industries, of course,
will be able to be confident that they
will be encouraged by the tariff to
expand their production. In every case
the Tariff Board will look during its
inquiry for special reasons for not
moving tariffs toward a uniform level,
and when it finds these it will recom-
mend accordingly, and an exception will
be made.
The Australian British Trade Associa-
tion had some sensible comments to
make about the affair last week:
“The Board is properly concerned
with the most advantageous allocation
of such scarce resources as finance and
labor, which will provide “increased
stimulus to industrial development, in-
cluding development in the protected
sector.” It also expects that its proposed
procedures “should assist those making
important investment decisions.
“These proposals deserve a more
intelligent treatment than emotional
telegrams to Members of Parliament
incorporating such exaggerated phrases
as ‘the removal of tariff support for
many industries.’ The Board’s avowed
aim is ‘at least to contain industries in
the high-cost area.’ This is not without
precedent. In its report on Woven
Cotton Fabrics dated August 6, 1965,


the Board stated quite clearly that its
recommendations were framed to pro-
tect the existing industry but not to
encourage expansion beyond the main-
tenance of its share of the market. This
is not ‘the removal of tariff support’
nor did it result in plummeting share
values. In any case the maintenance
of share values should hardly be a
prime objective of tariff policy.”
MEN AND MATTERS
THREE YEARS AGO, Big Bill Gunn
got a group of Texans interested in the
idea of buying into the Australian graz-
ing industry. So they bought three
cattle stations on Cape York Peninsula
for $1.4 million. But one of them,
William B. Neely, a farmer and
rancher from Midland, an unexciting
town of 21,000 people in Texas, thought
there was more rural potential in the
north of Australia than just using it
for grazing. So when Sir William
suggested to him that land in the Daly
River area of the Northern Territory
may be good for agriculture as well
as the grazing for which it was cur-
rently being used he jumped at the
idea.
Sir William knew the area pretty
well; he was a half-owner of Doug-
las Station, a small area adjoining the
mighty 2.3-million-acre Tipperary
Station, which was then owned by a
Bill Neely
Nan Sanders
Chinese-Australian syndicate who had
recently bought it for $BOO,OOO. So 15
months ago, after some intensive re-
search on rainfall and soil, Bill Neely,
a 54-year-old grandfather, Elder of
the Presbyterian Church, former Mayor
and local bank director, got his Texan
friends interested enough in the idea
to . get together the $1.5 million neces-
sary to buy Tipperary from its new
•owners, and then six months later
floated off a s3| million public com-
pany in the U.S. to own and develop
the area.
But Bill Gunn, who was appointed
managing director of Tipperary at
$30,000 a year, has now retired to look
after his other interests, and Bill Neely,
chairman of the executive committee,
announced last week that a young Mid-
land petroleum engineer had taken up
Bill Gunn’s reins. He also revealed that
Tipperary had gone into the prospect-
ing business (along with prawn fishing
and processing) and was actively ex-
ploring nine authorities to prospect,
covering 6750 square miles of northern
Australia, or about double the size of
Tipperary Station itself.
But the main feature of Tipperary
is still very much the plans that Neely
and his Midland friends have for intro-
ducing agriculture to the station. Under
the Northern Territory law (recently
amended to allow the company to cul-
tivate grazing land after a bitter
battle), the Americans intend to
develop 200,000 of the 750,000 suit-
able acres in their holding for grow-
ing crops (mainly grain sorghum for
export to Japan Mitsui has already
signed a contract and the U.S. west
coast) in a system based on the stag-
gering concept of three crops a year on
land irrigated from a dam they intend
to build on the Daly River.
THINGS WON’T be nearly the same
in the wool world, especially at Wool
House in Bourke Street, Melbourne,
when Nan Sanders leaves her job as
the Australian Wool Board’s promo-
tional director to spend a bit more
time with her naval spouse, Captain
lan McDonald, and, unless some new
world to conquer looms up, develop
some of her manifold outside interests.
She came to the Wool Board in 1959
when it was a bureau and leaves it
with a fully fledged promotion organi-
sation whose nine departments will
now be integrated in a new set-up
under the commercial director. Even
before Miss Sanders arrived at the
Wool HQ shortly after her marriage,
she could claim to be one of the
most experienced businesswomen in
Australia. With ten years or so in
her wool post, which has entailed
building up the promotional organisa-
tion from very scratchy foundations
and going globe-trotting every year to
persuade the world to buy our most
important staple, this handsome woman
must be one of the top business execu-
tives of her sex anywhere.
It all started quite modestly at
Southport, in Queensland, in 1921. Her
first schooling was there, at St. Hilda’s,
and then at Cairns High School
farther up the coast. When she
finished school, the war was on and
she went to Sydney, where, in due
course, she became Director of Food
Services to the American Red Cross,
and with this food experience under
her belt moved on to be advertising
and personnel manager to a food-
canning firm. The war over, she joined
British Celanese, stayed there about
six years, and then set her sights over-
seas, going to Hong Kong for three
years to work for an import-export
firm, where, as well as being in charge
of advertising, she set up a string of
agencies for the business throughout
the Far East. On her return home she
turned her attention to the textile
business, taking a job with ICIANZ as
promotion manager before her appoint-
ment with the Wool Board,
No other Australian woman has
come such a long way in business as
the truly talented Miss Sanders.
Minerals
The biggest deal
AT VARIOUS TIMES over the past
three years, the Cliffs Western Austra-
lia Mining Co. deal has been pro-
nounced “imminent.” But at last,
according to people on both sides of
the fence, the next four weeks will
make or break this contract which has
been called—probably rightly—the big-
gest minerals deal in history. It will
involve somewhere between $lOOO
million and $l3OO million, according
to how the final contract prices pan
out.
Virtually everything about this deal
is complicated—history, the ore Cliffs
are working, and the structure of the
group that is finally settling into place.
Cliffs’ first major problem was with
the Robe River iron ore itself when
Western Australian shipping and min-
ing man Mr. Garrick Agnew, who had
knowledge of the deposit, brought in a
New York group, Howe Sound, to
prospect the area. The findings were
taken to Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co. of
Ohio, as experts on the making of iron-
ore pellets. At last month’s symposium
on the north, geological survey director
Mr. Joe Lord pointed out just how
difficult the Robe River ores were.
They are, he said, virtually unique to
this part of the world. The word
“limonites” covers many different
forms of hydrated iron ores, so the
term “Robe River limonites” is precise
only in that these varieties of ores can-
not be found elsewhere and so have
not been tried and accepted by steel-
makers.
The next problem was with partners.
Originally, Cleveland Cliffs took up 51
percent of the group, with Mitsui and
Co. 35 percent, Agnew 6|- percent, and
the rest to be allotted. There was a
loose arrangement that BHP would
link up with Cliffs on transport and
port facilities, going out through Cape
Preston. When BHP moved across to
manage the Mount Newman group,
Cliffs went, too. But there was no pro-
vision made for the group in the BHP-
Amax-CSR triumvirate, which in turn
was changed somewhat in the following
months.
Cliffs went back to Robe River with
a good contract price (19.1 cents per
unit for pellets) but a new set of


The Croesus Touch
SWEET STATISTICS AND
SOUR POLITICS
FOR THE SUGAR MARKET
BY J. C. HORSFALL
EVEN IF negotiations, now in limbo,
for a new international sugar agree-
ment had succeeded in arranging world
quotas the Australian sugar industry
would still be in trouble. Its present dif-
ficulties derive directly from the
decision taken on the recommendation
of a Queensland Government committee
of inquiry (1963) to increase produc-
tion in the following two years from
the 1963-64 total of 1,724,253 tons to
2.26 million tons (of which N.S.W.
would produce a mere 132,000 and
Queensland the remainder).
The Queensland Government, which
controls the whole industry (includ-
ing the small N.S.W. segment), took
the decision apparently confident (good-
ness knows why!) that the denial of
Cuban sugar to free world supplies and
the U.S. embargo on it would continue
indefinitely, that in the circumstances
free market prices would remain high
and that it would be easy to dispose of
the increased Australian production at
xemunerative prices.
The upshot of the Queensland Gov-
ernment’s decision was that although
adverse seasons prevented the target
-being reached in 1965-66, last year
Australian production reached 2,342,000
tons or 82,000 tons more than target.
But the amount required for home con-
sumption last year was only about
.50,000 tons higher at 585,000 tons
(estimate) than in 1963-64. The amount
of sugar available for export and a
few miscellaneous uses from the year’s
production had jumped from 1,112,000
to 1,757,000 tons.
It would have been fine had free
market prices stayed as strong as at
the time the decision to grow more
cane was taken, or even if prices had
Eept reasonably firm (they’d been over
$250 a ton earlier in the Castro*
Kennedy play). Unfortunately for
Queensland’s Sugar Board, as also for
the growers and the mills, who respec-
tively get 70 percent shares of the
pooled receipts from combined home
consumption, export, and miscellaneous
sales, the price on the free market
(where about 45 percent of internation-
ally traded sugar is sold) slumped to
as low as $3O a ton at one time last
year, and although it has since been up
to roughly twice that figure it has since
come back to $5O a ton. In the event
the Queensland Sugar Board has not
only been selling the greater part of
Its exported sugar well below its cost
of production (reckoned to be about
$BO a ton on some estimates), it has
also had considerable difficulty in find-
ing buyers for its mounting surplus
above the supplies it sells under special
marketing arrangements (such as the
Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, which
expires in 1974) and various regional
selling arrangements at preferential
prices. Unfortunately, such arrange-
ments, highly useful though they are,
are not flexible enough to make much
of an impact on the overall surplus
problem.
Australia’s main outlets under such
arrangements are Britain, Japan, the
U.S., and Canada, who, going on the
trade returns, between them paid $9O
million for imports of Australian sugar
last year, the U.K. paying $41.6 mil-
lion, Japan and the U.S. about $2l
million each, and Canada $7.5 million.
Growing more cane at a loss
The most important arrangement is
with the U.K. under the British Com-
monwealth Sugar Agreement in which
our quota is 600,000 tons a year. Under
this agreement the price for the three
years to the end of 1968 has been fixed
at £stg. 42.5 a ton (without any con-
venient safeguards on Hong Kong
lines). So while this price is about
double the present free market price
(and we should at least be thankful
for that) Australia is not now getting
as much in local currency terms for
sugar exports to Britain under the
agreement as it did before the pound
was devalued last November. And, of
course, sales above a maximum of
335,000 tons to Britain are at free
market prices. The Australian Govern-
ment has indicated it will make up the
amount lost on devaluation, in due
course.
This is not the first time the Federal
Government has been called on to
cough up for the sugar industry. We
were reminded of this last year when
final arrangements were legislated
(Sugar Marketing Agreement Assistance
Act, 1967) for the industry’s repay-
ment of the $l9 million the Federal
Government (through the Reserve
Bank) put into the No. 1 sugar pool
in September, 1966, to bring it up to
a level comparable with the previous
season’s.
The Geneva conference on sugar
having broken down and the possibility
of getting a world agreement on quotas
looking remote (despite further efforts
being made behind the scenes to get the
dissenting parties to agree) it mightn’t
be long before the industry has once
again to come cap in hand to Canberra
(where it is always assured of a good
political welcome if not a financial
one).
While the failure thus far to get
an agreement on international quotas
is highly disappointing from the Aus-
tralian industry’s viewpoint, it has, in
fact, been living with this situation
since 1960 when the quota arrange-
ments written into the 1959-1968 Inter-
national Sugar Agreement (which ex-
pires at the end of this year) broke
down— Australia’s quota for that year
was 651,000 tons, and made that agree-
ment practically a useless shell. This
makes the Queensland Government’s
1963-64 decision to expand sugar pro-
duction all the less excusable because
at no time since 1960 has it looked
very hopeful that the big consuming
countries would agree to quota arrange-
ments. The biggest consumer, the U.S.,
is not all that interested in lining
Cuba’s pocket by taking more sugar
off the free market, where much Cuban
sugar has been filtering via Soviet-bloc
countries (we’ve taken a lot of it).
Equally, although the Common Mar-
ket has now settled its agricultural
policy and has, therefore, been able to
negotiate at Geneva with its lines on
beet-sugar production determined, it
poses quite a different problem in the
sugar world than Europe used to, pre-
war. The EEC countries now have a
surplus of sugar for export, whereas
before 1940 they imported a quarter
of their requirements.
Also some sugar exporting countries
with only moderately sized surpluses
for which they’ve got fairly good
regional arrangements for sales at pre-
ferential prices were apparently not
all that keen in pressing for quotas at
Geneva. About the only hopeful por-
tent there was that the world demand
and supply position of sugar is more
evenly balanced than it has been for
a long time, and infinitely more so than
two years ago, when the previous
attempt to agree on quota arrange-
ments was made and proved abortive.
But apparently this favorable statistical
climate could not dissolve the differ-
ences which are clearly more political
than economic.

economics on which to work them. It
has taken three years for this arithmetic
to be worked out fully. It entailed
moving the port from Cape Preston to
Cape Lambert and increasing the
throughput for their operation nearly
100 percent, by offering the Japanese
steel mills limonitic fines—the small
chunks of ore which are being sold by
other groups as overburden.
The new deal involved a. 21-year con-
tract starting 1970, with pellets going
out at 3.6 million tons a year, fines at
3.0 million tons a year. A sales offer of
18.75 cents per unit was made by Cliffs
last year for pellets, and in February
the Japanese made a counter-offer
which appears to be firm on both sides
of 18.5 cents. But on the matter of
fines, which control the new economics
of the operation, there is still some
horse-trading to be completed.
The Japanese agreed to take the
fines on one of two bases: (i) at their
price, which has not been divulged, but
which would probably be below 8 cents
per unit, gauged by prices being paid
for similar material; (ii) at a higher
price if full-scale sinter tests on the
Robe River material proved acceptable.
These tests started at the Muroran
works of Fuji Iron and Steel Co. on
April 22 and were completed on May
13, with 5000 tons of material taken
out under extremely careful control;
the tests are still being evaluated.
While this has been happening, the
structure of the organisation has
changed radically. Discussed for many
months in The Bulletin, the emergence
of Daniel K. Ludwig’s National Bulk
Carriers Inc. in the operation was not
announced officially until last month.
He is to take half-share, with Cliffs
managing the company on a reduced
equity, sharing one-quarter equity
with Mitsui. The other one-quarter
will be Australian, in an arrangement
yet to be fully detailed.
Fisheries
Getting together
NOW THAT THE Federal Govern-
ment has awakened to the need for
shipbuilders such as Evans Deakin to
keep labor forces and yards in work
by distributing some useful orders for
barges and other coastal craft among
them, it would also seem appropriate
if it harkened to the plea of the newly
formed Australian Fishing Industry
Council for some long-term low-interest
rate loans for that industry to purchase
boats. The country’s fishermen have
taken a long time to get together on a
national basis, and even Statewise
they’ve been singularly neglected by
governments in their efforts to develop
our fish resources and the marketing
of fish.
In asking loan money for larger boats
the Council is taking first things first
because that’s the industry’s most urgent
need. If it gets a bite on that one it
will later enter the loans race for
money for research. The Council’s
executive is also thinking in terms of
nationwide uniformity in fishing and
maritime legislation, and during its
three-day meeting last week decided it
was satisfied that the industry’s interests
were being safeguarded by the Federal
Government in its current talks with
Japan on the extension of exclusive
fishing limits from three to twelve miles
The talks should at least help to
put the Government in the right mood
to lend the industry some money. How-
ever, the Council seems pretty sore
about the possibility of more Australian
companies entering into joint fishing
ventures with the Japanese along the
lines of Gollin’s recent agreement with
a Japanese company to fish, process,
and market prawns (The Bulletin, May
25). The new Fishing Council be-
lieves the local industry has enough
forces of its own to develop the coun-
try’s fishing resources. Maybe this is
so, but the local industry’s efforts in
this direction since the war have been
lamentable.

BRIEFLY
The economy : Australia had a visible trade deficit for
the fifth successive month in May (due to big defence
spending) and the overall deficit for the 11 months
of the current fiscal year was then $2lB million compared
with $16.5 million at the same stage last year.
Australia is staging a massive export drive to South
Africa, with the first trade fair there in 13 years . . .
Retailers had one of their best trading months in April.
Waterside workers began a series of stoppages in major
ports throughout Australia in support of claims for a
wage flow on from the metal trades awards.
The Geneva negotiations for a world sugar agreement,
which broke down at the end of May, may reopen on July 1.
The markets: The unprecedented activity on Austra-
lian stock exchanges is exemplified by Sydney’s report
of peaks of 9608 floor transactions, trading 4,827,000
shares on June 4, eclipsing four or five new peaks in May.
Mining stocks were largely responsible for the succession
of records. The current best mining value was $4,079,000
on June 4, and the best ever daily record for all shares
was $7,757,000 on May 21.
The unbridled optimism in the oil market early in the
week gave way to some doubts, or profit-taking later,
but most oils with the exception of Mid-Eastern and Papuan
Apinaipi finished substantially the same as at the end of
the preceding week. Mid-Eastern picked up 33c on news
of the mineral float, and Papuan Apinaipi drew increased
attention, moving up 24c to finish at 82c.
CRA and New Broken Hill, the previous week’s
stars, finished level at $lB.BO and $16.10 respectively. Great
Boulder had more followers, pushing the shares 50c
higher to $10.30, while Silver Valley lost much of
its charisma, falling 90c on the week to $2.60 at end.
Hamersley climbed $1.60 to $l4.
There was a strong run on Hill 50 and Project Develop-
ment shares, both to $1.70, coincidentally, based on
nickel rumors, but confidence ebbed later'in the week.
Acmex jumped 75c to $4.30.
In industrials, takeover targets R. Fowler and Hotel
Metropole gained 51c to $l.BO and 80c to $4.20 respectively.
ICIANZ moved up 22c to $2.30, and CIG 63c to $4.08
on good news.
A cautious Wednesday on Wall Street following the
shooting of Senator Robert Kennedy was left well behind
as the market staged a strong rally through Thursday
to Friday’s close. Institutional traders were active
and the long awaited tax-hike announced as imminent.
In London, prices moved ahead on encouraging company
news indicating rising production and exports. There was
little reaction to the events in the U.S. Activity in
Australian mines and oils remained intense. There was
a slight falling off in most areas before the end of the week.
Companies: Evans Deakin and Adelaide Steamship Co.
won shipbuilding orders worth $13.5 million for a
group of vessels for off-shore marine work in Bass Strait.
Contracts secured by A. V. Jennings in the Dampier-Mt.
Tom Price area of W.A. are worth around $lB million.
ICIANZ sold less but enjoyed it more . . . profit
jumped 46 percent in the six months to March, with
increased efficiency, greater use of new plants settling down
to steady production, and reduced start-up expenses.
A one-for-five bonus was announced by CIG, when turn-
over rose 10 percent for the March half-year,
although profits only rose .from $1,353,000 to $1,469,000.
The London dock strike last year and New Zealand’s
devaluation squeezed profit of Gordon and Gotch in the
year to March, to 26.2 percent on capital.
The U.S. owned and controlled Tipperary Land Cor-
poration plans to take in Australian shareholders and
possibly seek local listing when its massive Northern
Territory grain sorghum project is well established.
The Hotel Metropole received a takeover offer worth
$4.5 million from the reinvigorated L. J. Hooker Invest-
ment Corporation . . . Houghton and Byrne may
be Powellised if the $1.4 million bid, $1.30 cash a share,
from U.K. owned Powells Pest Control Pty. Ltd.,
succeeds . . . Sanitary pottery maker R. Fowler Ltd.
received a $4.5 million offer from the “Royal Doulton”
group member, Doulton Potters (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. . . .
James Miller, rope and cordage group, takes over M.
Donaghy and Sons Pty. Ltd. of Geelong in a s2f million
deal.
The Plessey group has bought the outstanding 25 per-
cent interest in Telephone and Electrical Industries from
AEI . . . Taubman’s sold its 49 percent interest in the
pigments and dyes venture to its partner, Hoechst.
Mick Simmons was assaulted by a mystery raider, hunting
the shares at up. to 37c.
Waltons is seeking $3 million in debentures, and is
prepared to pay slightly higher interest rates for the medium
terms.
Silver Valley, amongst others, was the subject of scrutiny
by the Registrar of Companies to determine if buyers
and sellers of the shares acted on any leakage of
drilling information. Mt. Goldsworthy Mining, owned
equally by CGFA, Utah Constructions, and Cyprus Mines
Corporation, signed two contracts worth more than $BO
million to supply iron ore to Japanese steel mills.
Project Development obtained readings of nickel and
copper in its mineral reserve at Southern Cross . . . the
shares thereupon reacted from the recent peak of $1.65
to close the week at $1.05. Mid-Eastern plans to publicly
float its minerals exploration subsidiary, Eastern Prospectors
Pty. Ltd., and Mid-Eastern shareholders will have non-
negotiable rights.

Speculator’s Diary
TEXTILES COULD BE
HEADING
FOR A BREAKTHROUGH
THE OIL BOOM bubbles, the brokers
toil, and the only trouble is knowing
when to sell.
How much longer the boom will
continue is anyone’s guess. How hard
the brokers are toiling is common
knowledge they keep telling you.
How and when to sell is the main
trouble. Most popular theory is that
if you are intending to sell off shortly
do it in June. This theory is based on
the supposition that many large traders
are sitting tight and holding off taking
profits until the next tax year starts,
which, of course, is July 1. If this
is true, June should see a tightening
up in the scrip position and a firming
up in the price position. By the same
token, July could see a reversal of this
trend.
Although not anywhere as near as
exciting as mining and oil, one industry
which currently warrants closer inves-
tigation is textiles. Historically this
sector of the market has been poorly
treated. However, over the past few
years it has done much to improve its
image (like earning more profits) and
now looks as though it could be on
the brink of gaining greater recognition
and acceptance. Working on the
assumption that this year could be the
one when the scales are tipped, I de-
cided it could be profitable to be in on
the act. The company I chose as my
ticket was Prestige Ltd. Although
the company has been getting quite a
bit of limelight lately I feel there is
still a reasonable leeway for profit from
a six-month holding. Prestige (which
includes the Holeproof group or vice
versa) is well diversified within the
textile trade and is extremely well
placed to take full advantage of the
current upsurge in consumer spending
and the generally good all round
economic climate. The last annual
report gives some idea of the com-
pany’s range of products. It shows a
split up of sales as follows: 21 percent
hosiery, 19 percent fabrics, 18 percent
socks, 17 percent lingerie, shirts, and
underwear, 14 percent yarns, and 11
percent schoolwear and knitted outer-
wear.
The company hasn’t been perform-
ing all that well, not until recently any-
how. Between the years 1963 and 1967
the company managed to convert a 34
percent earning rate to a 24 percent
one. However, in the result just re-
leased for the year to 31st March the
company showed a very marked im-
provement. It’s profit rate for the first
time since 1965 was in the big league
again it was 31.7 percent, and my
guess (and hope) is that it is only the
beginning of a series of profit increases
for Prestige. On the basis that the
current year will be another boomer
for the company (and its shareholders),
I bought 200.
Working on the basis that sooner or
later the world currency problems (par-
ticularly those of the U.S.A.) are just
going to have to force substantial in-
creases in the price of gold, I made a
“better late than never” purchase of
Pekc-Wallsend. Of the gold-mining
shares available, Peko, even at its cur-
rent price, still looks the best hedge.
The company’s interests in other min-
erals such as beach sands, copper, coal,
bismuth, silver, tin,, and iron ore
(through Mount Morgan’s Mount Bun-
dey operation) give it a solid base of
operations which, in my opinion, the
other gold miners cannot equal. So on
the basis of a hitching up in gold
prices, I bought 100 at $l3.
There was some confusion last week
over the Associated Group and its mem-
ber company, Papuan Apinaipi
Petroleum. It is the group as a whole
which holds the over-riding royalty in-
terests in the Bonaparte Gulf area and
which has the Queensland coal deposits.
Members of the Associated Group are
Associated Australian Oilfields (25
percent), Associated Freney Oilfields
(25 percent), Papuan Apinaipi (12J
percent), Associated Continental
Petroleum (12£ percent), Interstate Oil
(15 percent), and H. C. Sleigh (10
percent). I selected Papuan Apinaipi
as one of the cheaper members of the
group with a good supporting turn-
over.
This week I’ve been on somewhat of
a selling spree. I’ye sold off four stocks
(at a profit, luckily) and made myself
liquid again. The sales were not in-
spired by any raging desire to be liquid
but more by a desire to be conservative
and to realise some profits on stocks
that have shown good gains. The
stocks sold were Cresco (W.A.) at a
profit of $97, R. Fowler for a gain of
$254, Mt. Lyell at take home increase
of $244, and Alliance Oil for the best
return of all, $364.

Nickel: how much, what grade?
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
NOW IT’S NICKEL’S turn again.
The chartists have had nickel stocks
rearing to go for a week or so and now
the time has come, as discoveries, and
the rumors of some sensational finds
soon to be announced, have wrested the
centre of attention away from oils.
Our chartist sees a good picture of
rapid rises over most of the nickel
stocks, and there seems to be some
backing for .this view in what is actually
happening in the search itself.
There is mounting evidence of a
massive nickel province in Western
Australia; last week’s Project Develop-
ment find and the previous week’s
astounding Anaconda-New BH-CRA
discovery have upgraded the chances
of every operator in the area. (Our
mining correspondent discusses the
area on pages 54 and 55.) Those
that have already discovered nickel are
all odds-on in the market to discover
"more; those that are still hopeful have
high hopes of finding some.
In future, investors are going to
have to pay a lot more attention to
the grades and size of discoveries; just
finding some nickel will not be enough
in a market with nickel coming out of
its ears.
But if the widespread rumors of last
week are any guide, there are some
really rich and large nickel areas now
being tested. The most striking
evidence of someone’s confidence on
this score was last week’s purchase of
50,000 call options in Western Mining
Corporation, which will require the
contributing shares (on which most were
taken out) to rise by $2.20 or so to
about $12.30 or so before they cover
their cost, let alone begin to pay off
(and for the fully paids to rise, by the
same token, by $2.75 to about $l5).
There are also plenty of hopes for
this week’s quarterly report from Great
Boulder; last week there was quite a
flutter in the stock when a “notice
pending” sign appeared against its
name, but this was only to report the
chairman’s retirement and to enable the
new chairman, Mr. Nils Nilsen, to tell
a Press conference that the company
regarded its Mt. Martin and Scotia
nickel prospects as “very promising”
and that it was looking at three or
four other areas.
Great Boulder’s Jones leases (where
it is associated with North Kalgoorlie)
have been attracting most of the mar-
ket’s attention in recent times. But Mr.
Nilsen stressed the significance of Mt.
Martin, where “we know there are
quite substantial thicknesses of sul-
phides” and where “we have had shows
of gold, silver, and copper which
could posibly be mined at the same
time as any nickel” (which could be
treated at a rate of up to 30,000 tons
a day in Great Boulder’s existing gold
plant).
WMC CLEARLY dominated the call
options business last week, and Great
Boulder was also in fairly strong
demand. But there was plenty of
activity in other stocks, and not only
those on the oil and mining posts.
There has been some solid buying of
call options in Petersville as the never-
ending stream of rumors of a possible
takeover continue to arouse a specu-
lative spark in what looks otherwise
to be a pretty dull stock. There has
also been some activity in A. G. Heal-
ing and Ampol Petroleum.
IT IS HARD to arouse much interest
in the industrial sector of the market in
these stirring days on the mining post.
But the expert share advisers and
brokers are still telling their clients of
the benefits that come from this sec-
tion of the market as the economy con-
tinues to progess. Even Graeme Moir
(the man wbo “discovered” WMC)
includes some industrials in his invest-
ment portfolio and is suggesting that
his clients look at the broadcasting and
telecasting industries as having “dyn-
amic potential.” The Cowan Invest-
ment Service continues to recommend
industrial stocks (including the “Herald
and Weekly Times” largely because
of its TV and broadcasting activities).
Leading Sydney broking house Ord
Minnett T. J. Thompson last week
recommended 10 growth stocks that
did not include one with even a smell
of nickel (Allied Mills, AGC, Bank of
N.S.W., Burns Philp, Consolidated
Press, Lindeman, Penfolds, Queensland
Press, Tooheys, and W.A. Newspapers)
but in which newspaper-television-
broadcasting companies predominated.
This broker also suggested eight
recovery or income stocks (Ansett,
Clyde, G. J. Coles, Custom Credit,
Elders, Email, Malleys, and A. G.
Sims), several of which have featured
recently in The Bulletin’s behind the
balance sheet feature. The speculations
he tipped were Alliance, McDonald,
and Mid-Eastern, and in natural re-
sources he decided to stick with the
strength BHP, BH South, CSR,
Hamersley, and Western Titanium (a

recently because its extra $| million

another newspaper stock, John Fairfax,
along with David Jones and Farley

THE MERITS of sticking with leading
stocks notwithstanding the attractions
of some more flighty performers have
often been stressed here. And last
week’s news from the Consolidated
Goldfields group underlines the sound-
ness of such a policy.
The continuing increases in ship-
ments by the group’s one-third owned
iron-ore operation, Goldsworthy Min-
ing Ltd. (with the promise of further
rises to come), go a long way toward
justifying the doubling in the com-
pany’s share price in the past 18
months.
The March quarter saw Goldsworthy
increasing its shipments by 27 percent
to an annual rate of about 4.9 million
tons, or enough to earn Consolidated
Goldfields something like $3.2 million
a year from iron ore alone.
The Melbourne Market
Jaded appetites
in paradise
WITH SO MANY odd pieces in the
current investment pie bits of ground
near somebody else’s nickel or oil find
—and the public more than ever in this
boom prepared to reach for them (even
those in outer space), it is not all that
surprising, perhaps, that when a mas-
sive show like ICIANZ comes up with
a resounding profit increase the market
barely nods in recognition. Perhaps it
might have been a bit different after
the big chemicals group announced its
profit if it had increased the dividend
or made a bonus issue (as Common-
wealth Industrial Gases did with its
one-for-five bonus after only a slight
profit rise, and got a much more gener-
ous ovation than ICIANZ did in the
way of a price lift). But, obviously, as in
the case of another heavyweight, British
Tobacco (also after an excellent result),
ICIANZ has hardly an ounce of inter-
est in it to whet the appetite of the
present “with it” investors looking for
their day’s rises in dollars rather than
cents. It may be said truly that the
market is a fool’s paradise in its pres-
ent mood and that the sooner it comes
down to earth the better. But what
broker (another seat has been sold on
the Melbourne Exchange) ever made a
quick fortune out of a steady business
in blue chips?
WITH THE BIG question not yet
answered by the company as to how
Nylex is going to finance the trebling
of its plastic-moulding operations, it
might have been expected that some
nibbling would have taken place in the
shares. The bait was not taken. It
could well be that Nylex could pre-
pare the ground for a possible new par
issue by making a bonus to leaven the
harvest of shareholders’ funds if that
is the way the thing is going to be
engineered, which is by no means cer-
tain, of course. Obviously, something
along these lines could be in the mind
of CIG, whose bonus was interpreted
that way by some people. Intriguingly,
also, Nylex, which is, of course, the
biggest thing we have in plastics here,
announced it was finding competition
pretty tough, so it might be thinking
of mopping some of them up in a
fashion more popular in the plastics
industry in the old days than it seems
to be now. Anyway, its competitors
better look ahead, because the full new
complex in position at Frankston will
be calling the moulded-plastics tune
much more than it has been doing since
it buried its erstwhile title of Moulded
Products.
The company’s shares have certainly
not set the market alight so far this
year, dealings being as low as 92 cents,
as high as $1.30, and now $1.25. At
the present price they give the rather
uninteresting dividend yield of 4 per-
cent, which epitomises the market’s
high regard for the investment quali-
ties. The 10 percent dividend was
covered 1.7 times last year. Add ta
that the spice of financing arrangements
for the $2 million expansion benefiting
shareholders and the gearing of the
group to enjoy the economies which
would flow from the expanding scale of
operations. The share-price potential
looks assuring.
WHEN ARTHUR RYLAH joined the
board of Easywear Ltd. last year, one
hoped he might set a good example
to all listed public companies and
issue interim statements showing bell,
book, and candle in arithmetic terms.
Alas, the Easywear interim only
rounded off the half-year’s results in
terms of “good” and “reasonable.” At
least this was something, but now he
has joined the board of Avis (as a use-
ful line out to the tourist industry, he
says) the matter of providing tangible
information won’t have to disturb him.
The only listed company in its lines of
business is Kay’s Corporation, though
even that has more of a leasing than
a renting slant to it, which, having
done a public service in knocking down
that dreadful building of British
Tobacco’s in Swanston Street and set-
ting up a brand new HQ for itself in
its place, has now elected to get into
the hotel business by buying the pub
(the Oxford Hotel) next door.
The possession of one or more hotels
doesn’t necessarily make an investment
summer, of course, but the say-so about
this buy, which is in the heart of the
airline-terminal country (and just
round the corner from Bouverie Street),
could predicate much more than hav-
ing an adjoining refreshment retreat for
the leasing and renting headquarters
staff, who could be feeling the pinch
from the hotted up competition aroused
by the gesture of the Reserve Bank let-
ting the trading banks into the leasing
field. The state of Kay’s market play
on the present activities is epitomised
in the lowly price of the 50-cent
shares, which swung into the narrow
range between par and 60 cents this
year, and now, at 55 cents, provide
a 9.1 percent dividend yield and more
than twice that on earnings which cov-
ered the 10 percent payment 2.1 times
last year.
The latest interim of 4 percent re-
peated the (reduced) payment for the
first half of last year, addifig the cold
comfort that profit was slightly lower,
despite revenue being about the same,
thoughts that could well be a great
temptation for the board to fish in
hotel waters which, after all, might give
the renting and leasing side a nice
captive market if prosecuted strenu-
ously enough. For those who like a bit
of freelance fishing, the shares could
ultimately prove to be quite a catch.

Behind the balance sheets
H. C. Sleigh: oil plus security
IN THE current fevered atmosphere
of the oil market, almost the only
industrials which aroused any interest
are those with some connection with
oil exploration and exploitation.
Shares of H. C. Sleigh Ltd., pur-
veyors of Golden Fleece petroleum,
have already caught some of the stock-
market fever. They have run up from
a low of 55c in 1967, in retrospect
ridiculous faint-heartedness about such
a well-run company, and from 67c in
1968 to a peak this year of $1.16. The
yield at current price of 99c is 5 per-
cent and could suit the investor-cum-
speculator who has not quite the nerve
for outright gambling on oil explorers
and who wants some income.
Major factors influencing Sleigh’s
future are the possible realignments in
the oil industry stemming from
crude production in Australia, recent
petrol price rises, and the possibility
of further ones to take care of the
higher cost of using local crude,
revision of oil production incentives in
1970, developments in Sleigh’s indirect
exploratory interests, Sleigh’s relations
with its associate, Caltex, and the future
of Sleigh’s 30 percent interest in Fire-
stone’s rubber business.
The interim report of a rise in pre-
tax profit from $2,888,000 to $3,969,000
is exceptionally good. Even deducting
the $500,000 non-recurring benefit of
sterling devaluation, the increase is 20
percent on a petroleum gallonage turn-
over rise of 7.6 percent. (These were
price increases for motor spirit in May
and August, 1967, throughout Austra-
lia.)
Tax benefits were available from
Phillips Oil tax losses in the first half
■of the current year, so the post-tax
profit increase should be even better
than 20 percent, and fresh tax allow-
ances will be available for the sub-
scription to Timor Oil in the second
half of the year about to close.
The full year’s net result could be
very good indeed, as tax provided by
Sleigh in the years 1966 and 1967 was
only about $lOO,OOO less than standard
rates, and this was attributable to
exploration subscriptions. Only in 1964
and 1965 was there evidence of sub-
stantial tax alleviation, presumably from
tax losses of some of the Hardie Rubber
subsidiaries.
Sleigh’s ten percent interest in the
Associated Oil group gives it a tithe
in the 125,000 million cubic feet gas
reserves in central Queensland and its
long-term contracts to supply Austral
Pacific Fertilisers and South Brisbane
Gas and Light Co. (This should be
income-producing in 1969.) The Asso-
ciated group is currently drilling in the
Roma area.
Chairman of Sleigh, Mr. Hamilton
Sleigh, is also chairman of Amalgama-
ted Petroleum, and H.. C. Sleigh had
a ten percent interest in Amalgamated,
until the latter issued 1* million shares
recently to an “unnamed party.” In
February, Sleigh took up 500,000 shares
in Timor Oil at par, with options to
take up the same number of shares at
par within five years. Those shares are
currently worth about three times
Sleigh’s cost, and the options are
valuable, too.
The Associated group has a good
coal prospect, so far not yet evaluated.
Taking a rough line through Papuan
Apinaipi, the member of the group with
12* percent interest, and the simplest
capital structure, Sleigh’s interest could
be calculated at ss* million.
■v t oi-i ,
Each year Sleigh attempts to cal-
culate the value of its interest in oil
and mineral exploration and develop-
mem. The cost of the Amalgamated
ho dmg in 1967 accounts was $484,000,
with a then market value of $72,000.
*.°. ay ..,. a aou C e , voiai a , JOLI [
$ .1 million. The cost of the Associated
group interest was shown at just over
$2 million. The company had deter-
mined a provision of slf million for
diminution in value, leaving a net total
figure of $737,000 for all oil and mineral
exploration and development.
The volatility of the oil market is
well known, and present inflated prices
may bear little relation to the eventual
real value of those interests. But it
looks as if the Associated and Amal-
gamated interests of Sleigh are now
priced on the stock market at about
$5.6 million more than their written-
down book value at June 30, 1967, and
the recent fortuitous investment in
Timor is showing a paper profit of
$500,000, with the prospect of another
$500,000 if the company exercises its
options to take up additional shares.
In each of the past five years the
company has spent $300,000 to
$400,000 to $500,000 on oil and
mineral exploration and development.
As it has now earned its ten percent
interest in the Associated group, this
expenditure would have tapered off
but for the Timor purchase. Any time
a tax benefit is required in this business
it is pretty easy to arrange to subscribe
to some oil-prospecting company.
Apart from recognition of Sleigh’s
exploration interests, the current market
for its shares is somewhat inflated, as
is Ampol’s, by continuing talk in invest-
ment circles that BHP would wish to
acquire one of the smaller petroleum


marketers. But the feeling in the
industry is that BHP has no need to
own a refinery or distribution outlets,
as all marketers in Australia are com-
pelled to use local crude in whatever
proportion Australian production is to
total consumption.
Sleigh has 2050 service stations in
its nationwide chain, including 160 with
restaurants, ocean terminals in all
States, 150 country bulk depots, and
1100 country agents. (Ampol, with
whom Sleigh discussed merging in 1960,
has about 2250 retail outlets.) Sleigh
took over the Phillips Oil chain Of 100
units, together with depots and agencies,
for a price of $6 million cash, effective
from February 28, 1967. Phillips
brought with it tax losses of at least
million, which will bring solid
benefits to Sleigh for 1967-68.
It is believed that the profit derived
from the Phillips acquisition will be
exceptionally good. The takeover
should add five percent to gallonage
sales, which were last year, including
four months’ Phillips turnover, 240.5
million. (The value of group turnover
fell from $117.5 million to $95 million
because of the Hardie sale.)
There has been some rationalisation
of the headlong expansion in the
marketing of petroleum in Australia,
for at June 30, 1967, there were 204
fewer operative reselling sites at 21,057
than in 1966.
Anyway, Sleigh, without the inter-
national resources of most of its com-
petitors, cannot afford to join the
service station rat-race, and of recent
years has moved very cautiously in
expanding its chain. Its requirements
for capital expenditure have, therefore,
not been great, and, in fact, investment
in fixed assets held steady in 1966 before
the sale of Hardie Rubber.
Since July, 1965, it has imported its
own crude, mainly from Indonesia,
transported it in its own and chartered
tankers, and AOR at Kurnell has
processed the crude to Sleigh specifica-
tions. Previously Sleigh purchased the
refined products from AOR, but the
present arrangement is more beneficial
to Sleigh. At the time, Sleigh pointed
out this important new development,
with further enlargement of its shipping
activities, would enhance future results,
and last year’s profits certainly showed
strong improvement.
The new agreement reduced prime
costs and achieved an important step
in vertical integration of Sleigh
petroleum activities, without involving
Sleigh in the extremely heavy capital
costs and administrative problems which
are associated with establishing a
refinery and which were experienced
by its rival, Ampol.
Ampol, of course, is now a crude
producer as well as refiner; Sleigh is
neither. Sleigh is therefore more entitled
to complain about the alleged inequities
of the present system of incentives to
Australian oil production. It has in the
past criticised the low level of explora-
tion subsidies and the formula for its
calculation.
Sleigh is in exactly the same position
as other marketers in relation to the
higher cost of fuel used, as Australian
oil production steps up with the
exploitation of Bass 'Strait fields. But
present crude purchases by Sleigh from
overseas are under long-term credit
arrangements, which enhance Sleigh’s
working capital position substantially.
It will have to finance local crude
purchases under less favorable condi-
tions.
The proportion of group funds
employed outside petroleum is probably
very small, although it is hard to deter-
mine, because the tankers, for instance,
are a related activity, a service to the
oil marketing, and Sleigh itself does not
separate the different functions.
When Hardie Rubber was part of the
group, it represented about 30 percent
of funds employed and of profit earned.
Hardie was acquired in 1960 for a
share deal worth $6.6 million. In recent
years cheap tyre imports and increasing
competition from manufacture in Aus-
tralia by overseas tyre giants were sup-
pressing Hardie’s profit and prospects.
Sleigh relieved itself of this problem by
selling 70 percent of Hardie Rubber for
$4.8 million, with repayment by 1970
of loan funds totalling $11.7 million
(Sleigh’s 1967 accounts show Firestone
as a long-term debtor for $11.7 million
and a current debtor for approximately
s2£ million).
In a clean-up typical of new manage-
ment, Firestone recorded a loss of sl£
million for the 16 months to October,
1967, of which Sleigh’s share would be
$375,000, although offsetting this Sleigh
earns interest on the loan funds. Intro-
duction of new moulds, patterns, and
manufacturing procedures meant the
write-off of a lot of things, but this
year, to October, Firestone could be
profitable. Sleigh expected to benefit
from the accelerated expansion which
would inevitably occur in the develop-
ment of Hardie Rubber by Firestone.
Sleigh’s 1966 accounts showed a
dividend of $2,428,000 relating to
Hardie Rubber, of which $1,449,000
was a distribution of pre-acquisition
profits. The balance was a legitimate
dividend, but did not necessarily relate
to Hardie’s 1966 earnings.
The company, along with Ampol, has
a 25 percent interest in the Australian
Lubricating Oil Refinery (with Caltex
50 percent), whose $26 million refinery
producing lubricating oils at Kurnell
opened in March, 1964. At 1967
balance date, Sleigh had almost sl|
million on loan to ALOR. Dividends
of $137,000 have, been received in the
past two years, ten percent on capital,
and a further $137,500 will be received
in the second half of the current year
in respect of the 1967 calendar year.
According to 1967 accounts, the ship-
ping subsidiary, Dominion Navigation
Co. Ltd., owned four tankers and three
passenger and cargo vessels, with total
deadweight of 105,000 tons. Shipping
had very pleasing results in 1966-67,
and higher earnings in the December,
1967, half than in 1966. A valuable
new agency has been obtained between
the west coast of U.S.A. and Austra-
lia, and the first vessel arrived in April,
1968.
The margins on the export business,
which grew very satisfactorily by 19
percent to $23 million in 1966-67, are
extremely small. The Meatpak sub-
sidiary lost $164,000 in 1966-67 due to
drought.
Caltex and its nominees have 31.3
percent of Sleigh’s issued ordinary and
deferred capital and 28.4 percent of
the voting strength. Sleigh issued Caltex
with 10 million deferred C shares of
50c and 25c premium on July 1, 1965,
terms which Sleigh described as very
favorable when the local investment
market was so weak. The shares rank
for 1\ percent dividend until July 1,
1972, when they convert to ordinary
shares.
The 10 million B ordinary shares
do not participate in dividends until
July 1, 1971, when they carry a maxi-
mum dividend of 1\ percent, or may
be converted to ordinary shares at a
42c premium.
The C ordinary shares issued to
Caltex received half a year’s dividend
in 1966-67, so for 1967-68 the group’s
dividend obligations go up by $187,500
to $3,202,000. Next year’s dividend
commitment increases by $239,000 with
the conversion of 4,784,162 notes to
shares.
If the 20 percent profit improvement
of the first half is maintained for the
full year, Sleigh could earn 15 percent
on ordinary capital, after allowing for
the 1\ percent dividend on the deferred
C shares, even if it were paying full
tax.
With Phillips’ tax losses, and the
benefit of the Timor subscription,
Sleigh’s liability for taxation will be
much reduced, so that, ignoring the
possibility of Sleigh providing for
future tax, earning rate could be
around 19 percent on ordinary capital.
In that event the present market
price of around double par value gives
an earnings yield of 9.8 percent, and
dividend return of five percent, while
investors in straight-out oil stocks are
forgoing income entirely. H. C. Sleigh
then should have some appeal for all
but the very impatient.

Cahills: a way of life
ORIGINALLY A GENTEEL chain of
superior tea-shops, Cahills Holdings
Limited has successfully developed the
old self-service canteen style of opera-
tion by combining it with pleasant
surroundings and providing facilities
for the sale of wine by the single glass
In cocktail bar-type settings.
The wine may not always appeal to
the Cellarmaster, for it is more vin
ordinaire than private bin or reserve
bin quality, but buying wine in bulk
from companies such as McWilliams
and Penfolds and selling it by the glass
can be very profitable, as Cahills have
proved. Since joining the Sydney Stock
Exchange in 1961, shareholders’ funds
have grown by 110 percent, total assets
by 97 percent, turnover by 83.1 percent,
and profit for ordinary by 69.8 percent.
About one-third of turnover would be
derived from the sale of wine in the
restaurants, and on a dissection of profit
the wine contribution would be even
higher.
Cahills restaurants are located only
in Sydney, and except for the “Ter-
race” restaurant in suburban Double
Bay the remaining 13 eating houses in
the chain are strategically placed
throughout the main arteries of the city
from Circular Quay in the downtown
area to Park Street and Castlereagh
Street in the uptown. The main im-
petus accounting for the upsurge in
company profitability over recent years
has come from the opening of the
Rail” self-service chain, which
has made a feature of attracting the
lunchtime patronage of the affluent
junior executives and private secre-
taries, where meals can be bought at
economical prices, but in relaxed sur-
roundings and where emphasis is placed
on atmosphere, decor, and special
fittings as well as on specialty food
dishes and drinks available at particu-
lar restaurants. The first of the “Brass
Rail” chain was opened in 1963, and in
1968 seven of these restaurants were
operating. Cahills also operates seven
conventional resaurants. One of the
“Brass Rail” units, the “Island Trader,”
located in Goldfields House fronting
Sydney Cove, is a mixed restaurant
with a family unlicensed area where
children can dine with their parents,
and be waited on, and there is also a
self-service unit with licensed wine
sales for adults.
Since 1962 control of the company
has been centred in W. M. Sturzen, the
managing director, and his father-in-
law, E. W. Swain, who is chairman. Mr.
Sturzen, who is in his late 40s, has a
background in the Swiss hotel and
restaurant trade and was a former
native of Switzerland. He joined Miss
Theresa Cahill in the late 1940 s and
became the general manager of the
chain before it floated as a public com-
pany. The Swain/Sturzen families
control about 20 percent of the Cahill
equity capital. Mr. Sturzen is noted
in the Sydney restaurant trade for the
tight control he exercises over the com-
pany, and his attention to detail on wine
sales, restaurant locations, restaurant
planning and presentation. A feature
of management has been the building
up of key staff to a point of becoming
interchangeable managers and per-
sonnel, able to operate any of the
restaurants in the chain. Restaurant
managers are paid on an incentive
system.
At each of the restaurant locations,
with one exception, Cahills do not own
their own freehold but operate on a
leasehold basis. This has given the
group considerable manoeuvrability in
being able to dispose of restaurant
locations which prove to have little
marketing advantage. The exception
is the “Dutch Tavern,” located on the
ground floor of the “Park Regis,” which
is owned by Cahills under strata title.
As a pie-eater from way back, lunch-
time restaurants do not attract me
greatly, but Cahills cash registers are
working overtime catering for over
10,000 people a day during the Mon-
day to Friday work-week. The “Island
Trader,” which seats about 450 people
and is now the most successful in the
chain, has a daily trade of about
2000-3000 patrons. What impresses me
most about the entrepreneurial skill of
the company is the attention to detail
in the background decor which high-
lights many of the restaurants in the
group. For example, in the “Dutch
Tavern,” with a decor of a Dutch
village, there are dummies of Dutch
girls with handmade clogs, and a big
windmill. There is also a tulip bed
with a base of imported Dutch ceramic
tiles and plastic tulips. The mixture of
authentic background and synthetic
imitation is part of the Sydney way of
life.
Cahills have a factory at Chippen-
dale (Sydney) which has been fitted
out with considerable bulk and freezer
storage space. The factory manufac-
tures cakes, pies, pastry, dry mixes, con-
fectionery, and confectionery sauces for
use in the restaurants, 'but some trade
is also carried on with outside customers.
The factory has a major role to play
in the preparation of food sold in the
restaurants. Menus are centrally con-
trolled by the group catering manager,
with the restaurant chefs having no
control in the selection of food. The
menus are simple and uncomprehensive,
to allow wherever possible for bulk
preparation of food in the factory, which
often takes the form of pre-processing,
including the use of deep freezing. The
food in its final form is cooked on the
restaurant premises. In restaurant trade
terms, Cahills menus are “short order”
meals, which means the use of uncom-
plicated recipes, where food can be
ordered and delivered quickly , to allow
for quick consumption and quick turn-
over of customers.

The only publicly listed restaurant
group in Australia (George Weston
Foods have a few eating houses in their
Australian complex, but of small con-
sequence to their total operation),
Cahills have made three issues to share-
holders since the listing in 1961 in
1965 a one for four, in 1967 a one for
five, and in March 1968, another one
for four. As a result of the emphasis on
self-service, the cost of wages and
salaries has been held reasonably con-
stant over recent years —in 1967,
wages and salaries represented 27.1 per-
cent of group turnover compared to
29.9 percent in 1962.
The 50c shares are highly priced at
$2.20 to show a dividend yield of 3.4
percent and a P/E ratio of 23.4 per-
cent on the enlarged capital. But the
company announced rising profits in
its February, 1968, interim statement,
a record profit could be under way, and
there is capital growth ahead.

Mining
Interest swings back to nickel
AFTER A HECTIC week in which
the market concentrated on oils, it has
begun to swing back to the metal which
started the mining boom. Late last
week rumors appeared regarding fur-
ther nickel strikes by Western Mining,
Great Boulder showed signs of renewed
interest, there were reports that Ameri-
cans, who hold Santos because of its
links with Delhi Petroleum, were
switching from their Santos shares into
holdings of Delhi on the strength of
that company’s joint nickel prospecting
venture with Vam, and Project Devel-
opment began what may turn out to
be a blow-by-blow description of its
progress in prospecting for nickel on a
30-square-mile temporary reserve near
Southern Cross, 150 miles west of
Kambalda.
Project Development has not let
much grass grow on this area. The
reserve in question had been contested
by other companies, including Con-
west (Aust.) Ltd., but the company’s
announcement that it had received
confirmation of its rights also con-
tained details of the results of prelimin-
ary testing by geochemical and geo-
physical work. Nickel readings were
obtained in ten acres and, against a
general background count of up to 100
parts (of nickel) per million, these
readings gave samples of between 500
and 2500 parts per million. In addition
to this, the testing also showed signs of
copper; against a background count of
around 20 parts per million, the com-
pany had samples of between 100 and
380 parts per million. These results are
only surface tests but they do give
positive encouragement and, certainly,
justify the additional work which the
company has already undertaken an
induced polarisation survey on which
a report is expected shortly, according
to the company’s chairman.
This report is the first to be made
on any of the Southern Cross areas
and no doubt means that the market
will upgrade the prospects of other
companies which have areas nearby.
These are BHP, Barrier Exploration
(with Metals Exploration), and Thiess,
which all have areas about 25 miles
to the east. And, of course, Western
Mining Corporation, which has the
ground adjacent to Project Develop-
ment’s, on the northern end.
Western Mining, in fact, has a very
extensive spread of exploration areas
which is perhaps overlooked due to its
remarkable success at Kambalda and
St. Ives, both as an explorer and as a
nickel producer. From Norseman in the
south to Leonora in the north and to
Southern Cross at the western end of
the “hot” country, its leases put it in a
good position to reap further benefits
from the nickel rush which began with
its own discoveries. Its main lease,
covering Kambalda, stretches in the
south to within a few miles of the
Anaconda-CRA-New Broken Hill strikes
near Higginsville, while to the north the
area near Scotia, on which the Jones
Syndicate has had showings of 2.54
percent nickel, is adjacent to another
Western Mining temporary reserve —•
and, of course, Project Development
area adjoins another Western Mining
reserve.
From this point of view at least,
Western Mining Corporation is a nat-
ural target for any rumors of new
strikes. According to Patrick & Com-
pany’s latest publication, the company
has more ground covered than any
other group, except Inco-BHP, with
over a milion acres held, including the
Kambalda lease. The nearest to this

An Independent Company
(neglecting unlisted companies) is the
CRA-New Broken Hill-Anaconda group
with about 950,000 acres. Patrick’s
publication attempts to illustrate each
acre of ground held by companies
looking for nickel in the west. In so
doing it runs into difficulties created
by the value which is already placed
on the existing non-nickel activities of
various companies but, this apart, it
does come up with some interesting
figures.
At current share prices, for example,
Western Mining’s areas have been
valued by the market at $730 per acre,
this includes all the company’s areas
and imputes no value at all to the
company’s productive operations, which
include iron ore, nickel, and bauxite.
This figure can be compared with the
value per acre at current share prices
of areas held by such companies as
Great Boulder ($1214), Metals Ex-
ploration ($10,493), Project Develop-
ment ($422), and Amalgamated Pet-
roleum ($37). The exclusion of
Western Mining’s leases other than its
main Kambalda area provides some
more food for thought; the market
valuation of this area of 300,000-odd
acres works out at $2646 per acre,
again disregarding the company’s other
interests, which are comparatively
minor when lined up against its activi-
ties as a nickel miner. On the other
hand, BHP’s non-nickel interests are
of some magnitude, and there have
been numerous estimates of what this
company is worth on account of its
iron-and-steel and oil-and-gas opera-
tions.
Patrick & Company’s calculations
show that the market valuation per
acre of BHP’s prospecting areas is
$5057 when BHP shares are selling for
$24 each. It is easy to see what effect
on this valuation there would be if one
attributes some specific value to BHP’s
existing activities. If these are worth,
.say, $2O per share, then the company’s
nickel areas are valued at $843 per
acre.
Such a calculation is, of course,
only arithmetic, but it does give some
indication of the scope which might
lie ahead for BHP shareholders should
it meet with any success in its nickel
prospecting and, after all, its own
leases adjoin Western Mining’s Kam-
balda area and (with the exception of
WMC) it has the largest lease close to
the Southern Cross area held by Project
Development.

If Dad shared in $6l million,
why cant I have an elephant?
Sure, you can have an elephant, son, if you really
want an elephant. My share of the $6l million
would put a deposit on just the elephant you’d
like. But, do you really want an elephant? What
we’ve got now is much better.
What we’ve got with The M.L.C. provides us
with a lot of very important things. It will make
certain that you can go to the University when
you are older; that your mother is always pro-
vided for, no matter what happens; that all of us
can go on a trip when I get long service leave.
Yes, son, an M.L.C. policy provides a lot more
than just an elephant.
The M.L.C. could buy tens of thousands of
elephants with its $750 million; but these assets
are kept working for us so that The M.L.C. may
be ready to pay all its claims promptly. With the
biggest bonus distribution ever, the largest
amount of new business, vastly increased assets
and very nearly 53,000 million sums assured and
bonuses in force, The M.L.C. has just had
another record year.
Yes, son, I think that instead of buying an
elephant I should get another M.L.C. policy
while I’m still young and in good health. I want
to go on sharing in the profits of such a friendly
and progressive company as The M.L.C.

THE LAND
W.A.’s advances in agriculture
AUSTRALIA has been so firmly in
the spotlight on the minerals stage these
past few years that its efforts in rural
development are inclined to be ignored
not only by mining-share speculators
but also in national calculations for
the provision of finance for them. How-
ever, if the State’s representatives in
Canberra must sometimes feel they
are voices crying in the wilderness on
behalf of its rural financial needs, Mr.
Charles Court, W.A.’s Minister for
Industrial Development, can always be
relied on, as last week, to prick con-
sciences in the East. Even before it was
announced that Victoria and N.S.W.
were to join forces to cadge $l6O mil-
lion for underground railway projects
in Melbourne and Sydney, he was
booming across the Nullarbor that
W.A.’s public works for rural develop-
ment were being starved and that it was
high time Victoria and N.S.W. made
tangible recognition of the fact that in
part they were living off the proceeds of
export income earned by W.A. (and
Queensland). As he saw it, these two
States and the Federal Government
thought only in terms of a few extra
dollars for W.A.’s rail-gauge conversion
and the Old River Dam.
Western Australia’s comprehensive
water scheme is only one case in point
in its massive program in agricultural
development, but in itself it is a good
measure of the efforts being made.
When the whole scheme is implemented,
it will serve an area of about 12.5 mil-
lion acres. The first stage, known as the
modified scheme and serving about
four million acres, was completed with
the help of a $lO million Common-
wealth grant.
The completion of the second stage
which will serve a further four mil-
lion acres was originally scheduled
for 1971-72, but this could be set back
by three or four years by rising costs.
The estimated total cost of the second
stage has risen from $2l million to
about $29 million. The Commonwealth
has agreed to lend W.A. up to $10.5
million to match State expenditure on
It. There is no schedule for the third
stage (about 4.8 million acres), though
the York-Greenhills and Corrigin-
Bullaring districts will probably be the
first to be completed when finance is
available.
Some of this is only for the future,
but here and now W.A. is bringing
vast new acreages under the plough
every year, as evidenced by the pro-
gressive trend in its wheat harvest. Last
year 400,000 new acres were added to
wheat cultivation, bringing the total to
6.9 million acres. The yield was
slightly lower at 15.9 bushels an acre
compared with 16.3 the previous season,
but production advanced to 106.5 mil-
lion ' bushels, which went some way
toward compensating for the poor
harvest in other States. The increase
in acreage this year is expected to be
at least as much as last season. A
similar increase and an average yield of
16 bushels this year would give W.A.
a harvest of about 113.5 million bushels.
An average of 17 bushels, which would
still be below W.A.’s record yield,
would mean a crop of about 120 mil-
lion bushels.
Switching to wool, W.A. is giving a
lead to Easterners in gearing itself for
containerisation. Recognising the sig-
nificance of containerisation and unit
cargo-handling techniques at the major
Australian ports, the Associated Wool-
brokers of Western Australia recently
formed a company known as Fremantle
Dumpers Pty. Ltd. Since last August,
Fremantle Dumpers has carried out
extensive experiments and cargo-
loading tests at Fremantle wharf,
using a bale-strapping technique. With
this technique, six standard dumped
bales are strapped together by two Qin.
steel bands.
The new company is staffed by
members from Elders-GM, Westralian
Farmers, and Dalgety-NZL, and at
present is carrying out bale-strapping
operations in the Port Beach store,
leased from the Fremantle Port
Authority.
An area of land reclaimed from the
sea near Port Beach will be the site
for a new strapping and dumping com-
plex to be built by Fremantle Dumpers.
In the past ten months, the company
has strapped and consigned more than
50,000 bales as unitised cargo. Test
runs at Fremantle have shown that
ships can be loaded with nine-unit and
12-unit slung loads. These loads repre-
sent a single lift of 54 and 72 bales
respectively. With loading and unload-
ing operations speeded up, the company
said, the quicker turn of shipping
which would result would contribute
considerably toward containing or
minimising freight costs on wool
exported from Fremantle.
Fremantle Dumpers plan to improve
the service by installing hydraulic
dumps which will produce an 11-cubic-
foot bale suited for containerisation.
About 80 medium-density dumped bales
will be loaded in a container. The
standard dumped bale consigned over-
seas today is between 19 and 20 cubic
feet.

New light on tractor accidents
SOME SHORT while ago we read
about a young fellow who was doing
nothing more dangerous than plough-
ing a flat paddock when he was killed.
The tractor seat was loose, and as he
was turning at the end of the land the
seat fell off and he along with it. The
discs of the plough caught him and
chopped him to death.
A man was using his tractor <o
round up the sheep. While steering
across a hillside with his eye on the
sheep rather than on the terrain, the
wheels of the tractor on the high side
mounted a large stone. The machine
overturned sideways. The man was
thrown off and killed when it rolled
down on him. A farmer whose tractor
had an unshielded power take-off left
the seat to juggle the pin out of the
drawbar when the shaft caught his
heavy winter clothing. Rather than tear
immediately under the strain, the
clothes knotted and hoisted him off
his feet. He was slammed repeatedly
against the mudguard and was soon
dead.
We could fill the rest of these pages
briefly recounting such tragedies. There
are about 100 fatal accidents involving
tractors each year in Australia, while
the non-fatal accidents total around
8000.
According to Melbourne University
engineers I. W. Grevis-James and
G. H. Vasey, “a simple sum shows that
quite a number of ordinary tractors are
unstable in low or lowest gears.” They
are referring to wheeled tractors, un-
loaded, on level ground. Such tractors
they classify as being “inherently un-
stable.” Tractors travelling uphill are,
of course, in an even more treacherous
situation. Provided the drawbar is be-
low the back axle, tractors are more
stable while they are pulling something.
However, this state of affairs does not
always exist even when the tractor is

hitched to a towed load. At any instant
his load can dwindle to' zero and there-
fore, as the engineers point out, “we
must not rely on any help that may be
offered by an uncertain load.” In
short, an inherently unstable tractor is
a damnable thing. But in certain circum-
stances, even inherency stable tractors
can also rear up and tip over.
All tractors, obviously, are dangerous
unless handled properly and driven with
a careful understanding of the mech-
anics of stability. Unfortunately,
Grevis-James and Vasey have dis-
covered that the textbooks, and hence
the instruction manuals based on them,
are not clear about the principles in-
volved.
These safety-conscious engineers are
currently considering the practical im-
plications of their basic findings and
will describe the dangers lurking in
them for tractor drivers in a forth-
coming issue of the Victorian Depart-
ment of Agriculture’s Journal. Safety
Instructions need to be formulated very
carefully and thoughtfully. For instance,
a recent publication of the U.S.
National Safety Council, entitled,
■“Avoid These Common Set-ups for Up-
sets,” contains a drawing showing a
farmer how to pull out a stump with
a tractor. The advice reads: “Hitch only
to drawbar or regular hitch points. Set
drawbar no higher than 17 inches from
the ground. Engage the clutch smoothly,
not suddenly.” The obvious implication
of this advice is that an agricultural
tractor can pull out a stump safely.
Engineers of the competence of Grevis-
James and Co. would surely recom-
mend that a farmer use a dozer to push
out a stump.
Some local statistics suggest that
about 10 percent of tractor accidents
result from the tractor tipping over
backward, but more details about the
nature of the accidents are being
gathered by all police forces in
Australia. Their reports are being
analysed by the Department of Agricul-
tural Engineering, University of Mel-
bourne, and the Mechanical Engineer-
ing Department of the University of
Queensland. In flip-overs the drivers’
chances of survival may be no better
than 50-50. Of all overturnings about
l-3rd are backward and 2-3rd sideways.
An odd coincidence is that the total
number of tractor accidents as a per-
centage of the number of tractors in
use is the same as the number of
traffic accidents per number of road
vehicles. In the U.S.A., where the road
carnage is proportionately much lower
than it is here, the number of tractor
deaths is also relatively low. So it
would seem that the efforts of that
country’s Safety Council, despite the
above example of bad advice, have
been worth while. Nevertheless, the
Council rates farming the third most
hazardous industry after mining and
construction.
Since our record of tractor accidents
Is even worse, it is high time a safety
campaign was launched and maintained
until everyone is constantly aware of
the dangers.


ARTS AND
ENTERTAINMENT
The discomforting savage
By SANDRA HALL
IRREVERENCE is still a hard com-
modity to peddle in this country, and
Ray Taylor, one of its pioneer salesmen,
has suffered accordingly. He first made
his reputation in Sydney in the early
days of television by treating somebody’s
tea commercials with a joyous sort of
laissez-faire. What he did to them was
probably no more outrageous than
Graham Kennedy’s treatment of com-
mercials today, but Taylor was out of
his time.
His second chance at television came
several years later in Melbourne, when
Channel 0 gave him an evening show.
“For the first six months it was good,
slick, balanced comment,” he says, “but
Reg Ansett really wanted something else,
so we changed it, and three months
later it was off again. I was sitting there
with my hair dyed, and there was noth-
ing there any more. As usual, it was
‘TV Times’ who rang up to tell me it
was over.”
Now Taylor is back on television,
this time with the ABC’s arts program
“Survey” and the 1968 Ray Taylor
model has a tautness, an astringency,
which is a kind of pared-down refine-
ment of those tea-commercial days. He
is both a writer and an actor in love
with words, which he fits together with
precision. On “Survey” the result is a
crackling bitterness, compelling to
watch. He lays about his targets with
such mordant enthusiasm that along
with one’s admiration for his skill, pro-
fessionalism, and feeling goes a question,
“What the hell does this man believe
In?”
We are sitting in the winter sun at
an outdoor cafe surrounded by Double
Bay elegance, and I put it to him. His
face breaks out of its usual quizzical
melancholia and he laughs.
“I’ve never really thought of it like
that. What I try to do is to take a new
angle on something—show it in a way
it hasn’t been seen before, and jolt
people out of their comfortable avenues
of thought.”
One of the objects to come within
Taylor’s focus in the current “Survey”
series was that answer to a satirist’s
prayer —the Opera House. His attitude
was neither pro nor anti—more “why
not leave it as it is since the site is
proving such a success as a tourist
attraction. This embryo stage of its
development may in retrospect prove to
have been the peak of its existence.”
“I suppose it’s a kind of nihilism,
really. One shouldn’t be savage,
because it usually means you’re vulner-
able—although with my own savagery
I’m just using one of the tricks of the
trade. For instance, it’s very hard to be
witty in praise of something. I used
to be more ‘causy’—a Liberal with Left-
wing convictions but there’s no sense
of humor in the Left any more than
there is anywhere else. Sometimes I
agree with the person who said to me
‘the war we really have to fear is the
one coming up between the workers for
peace.’ There are so many different
ones all so serious about their par-
ticular attitude to the question being
the only right one.
“Unfortunately, the Left-wing intel-
lectuals in this country are not com-
municating any sort of powerful mes-
sage. Sometimes,” he says, the nihilist
gleam of the Opera. House piece return-
ing, “I think we should do a sort of
Fascist satirical show—really give the
people the Right-wing views they seem
Ray Taylor ... “no malcontent”
to want. That way you might be able
to say everything you want to say.”
At present, he divides his time
between writing, acting, and the
occasional commercial (“all in an effort
to avoid regular employment, which, I
think, dulls you completely. No oppor-
tunity to experiment when you’re not
free”). There are people, he says, who’ll
scoff at “the great purist” doing com-
mercials when his next one comes out,
but the fee will allow him to work on
whatever he wants to do for a few
months.”
Although it wasn’t his first experi-
ence of the transience of life in tele-
vision, the collapse of the Channel 0
program left him with a sense of loss
and a wariness about plunging in again.
But the blow was softened by the fact
that it fell as he was rehearsing for a
part in an ABC play. He absorbed
himself in that, then spent “a hard few
months” writing months complicated
by a report exaggerating the size of an
inheritance left to him by his father.
“That story caused me more trouble
than I care to think about.”
These days he doesn’t quite know
whether he’s happy or not. That, he says,
is something you never find out until
it’s over but he enjoys his work for
“Survey,” and, as he has always done,
he enjoys writing. He’s writing television
plays, tender plays, he’ll say, forestalling
your disbelief, not an ounce of satire in
them.”
“Writing for the BBC, I’m up against
the best writers in the world. And it’s
hard trying to do everything at long
range. They don’t want to accept things
because I won’t be there for any re-
writes. The ABC is sitting on five of
my plays. You see, in doing these
things, I tend to go right back to my
beginnings, which are English and
there’s still something of a ‘kangaroo
syndrome’ here. Things must be about
Australia. But I have some very good
allies in the ABC.”
Taylor’s last stage appearance here
was in “Girl In My Soup” light,
successful, and I say, guessing, not his
kind of play.
“Because it was a polite comedy, you
mean? Yes, it was probably a good
one-act TV play with just the con-
frontation between the young girl and
the older man but spoilt by being
lengthened for the stage. I did it for the
money and also to work with the
director. I learned a lot from him.”
I am relieved to find Taylor has no
hard-and-fast opinions on the great
“Australia should we stay or go?”
question. All he says is that Australia
must have some kind of attraction or he
wouldn’t be here at all.
“A hearty injection of West Indians
would help, of course,” he says, warm-
ing to the idea. “No, I don’t think we’d
have the same trouble Britain’s having.
In fact, I don’t think people here would
notice them even if they came with
tanks and bazookas. Oh, they would in
Melbourne. It’s such a repressed city
a kind of joyless Germany with that
awful football orgy. There’s more pres-
sure there, and if something happens
either bad or good it will happen
there.”
By now he’s looking slightly wearied
by the combined effect of all this self-
analysis and an attack of bronchitis from
which he is just recovering. But he has
one point left to make.
“Don’t paint me as a malcontent. I’m
not, because I get it all out it’s the
ones who keep it all bottled up inside
who finally go mad.”

Music
Lustre for a
modern sound
By KENNETH ROBINS
IF YOU regard as valid the theory
that the aspirations and ideals,
manners and customs of a country are
mirrored in its art, then there was
plenty of evidence in the Borodin
Quartet’s second Town Hall concert
that the U.S.S.R. contains elements
which are progressive and liberal. The
popularly held view that the State only
condones a type of art which causes
peasants to slap their thighs in appreci-
ation is obviously false today, however
true it may have been in the past, for
the quartet of Alfred Schnitke, circa
1966, given its Australian premiere at
this recital, was as contemporary in the
real sense as anything emanating from
any part of the world. Although at no
time were the instruments required to
produce sounds which were alien to
their character, advantage was taken of
their capacity for portamento, and there
was plenty of ponticelli and harmonics.
But the net result was a satisfying string
quartet, and one of the rare examples
of atonal music where contrasts were
achieved apart from tempo changes and
dynamics.
One of the most telling aspects of
the work was its professionalism; too
often we are subjected to pieces which
are largely experimental, and any self-
respecting composer would treat them
as such by culling their best features
and then confining the rest to the
wastepaper basket. In the Schnitke,
however, there was no striving after
novely; in fact, the novel features in
the work had an inevitability which
is the talisman of all good music. Of
course there is always the danger of
being beguiled into thinking some music-
is much better than it actually is. This
must invariably constitute a hazard with
people like the Borodins, who could
make Chaminade sound like a major
composer, but I felt the Schnitke made
its point as music apart from the
virtuoso treatment it received.
Shostakovich is the grand old man of
Soviet music these days and he deserves
all the reverence he gets. The Borodin’s
performance of the Bth Quartet was a
deeply moving experience. This work
grows out of the germ of a theme which
is very reminiscent of the subject in
the fugal chorus “And With His Stripes
We Are Healed” from Handel’s
“Messiah,” and could well be a quota-
tion. Parts of this piece achieve such
sheer beauty of sound that even the
restlessness of the reactionaries in the
audience was stilled, no mean feat at
a Viva concert.
The Ist Borodin elicited the most

luscious and opulent tone from a fiddle
which has been heard in the Town
Hall since the young and uninhibited
Menuhin. Although the Ist Quartet has
never achieved the popularity of the
2nd, it nevertheless contains some
felicitous writing, some delicious tunes,
and where it moves into a fugue as it
does, dead on time, two-thirds of the
way through the movement, the effect
is solid and scholarly without being
pedantic. A fascinating insight into the
problems of temperament was afforded
by the combined excursion into
harmonics in the trio of the scherzo.
For once the Borodins sounded out of
tune; unable to adjust the pitch of
their notes, they were precipitated into
equal temperament, a compromise
usually tolerated only by players of
modern keyboard instruments, although
it is, of course, the sine qua non of the
twelve-note brigade.
The heavenly Mozart Quintet added
a young clarinet player, Pamela Spira,
from Melbourne. She fitted in splen-
didly, although, predictably, the en-
semble was not as immaculate as in the
other items on the program. This work
contains so much tender charm that
there is an almost irresistible tempta-
tion to linger and savor each phrase:
particularly in the slow movement and
the adagio variation in the finale.
The fare the Musica Viva provides is
of a high standard and rarely has their
promotion produced any group, local
or imported, which falls below the
highest expectations, but even this bril-
liant galaxy cannot dim the lustre of
the Borodin Quartet.

Misrepresented
By JOHN CARGHER
Aida (Verdi). Nilssen, Corelli, Bumbry,
Sereni, Rome Opera (Mehta). Angel
SAN 189/91 ($18.90).
IF THIS WERE a performance offered
on stage by the Trust, no superlative
would be spared in the review. But
this is an international all-star per-
formance such as is seen at the
Metropolitan or La Scala and it is on
disc, to be heard again and again.
Taken in either context the new “Aida”
is a failure. While one and all demon-
strate why they are of star quality,
not one is in full command of Verdi’s
intentions and only rarely do the parts
blend into a satisfactory whole. Birgit
Nilssen tries very hard to achieve the
Italianate drama of the title role and
she quite often succeeds. But the voice
does not melt easily and in the heroic
moments there is an unwanted dryness,
though the highest notes have plenty
of reserve behind them. Franco Corelli
is Franco Corelli, not Rhadames.
Though he ends “Celeste Aida” on a
good diminuendo, this is a vocal stunt-
ing without bearing on Verdi’s original
“ppp” demands. The rest of the cast
sing well without ever rising to bril-
liant heights. Zubin Mehta, the “fash-
ionable” conductor today (as Bernstein
was not so long ago), keeps things
moving without adding anything to the
music, and the orchestra is far from
faultless; in the great Triumphal Scene
the famous trumpet tune is distinctly
brass-bandy. The old Decca-Karajan
set has nothing to fear from this new
recording.
Arts Council
Who has time?
ONE COULD have hoped for a more
apparently dynamic membership of the
new Australian Council for the Arts,
also for a representation of those who
are practically knowledgeable about the
needs of the arts rather than of those
whose academic qualifications presumes
a sympathetic interest. All the members
of the council, announced last week by
Prime Minister Gorton, are graduates,
and all of them, from a study of their
positions and credentials, are very busy
people. Barry Jones, for instance,
seems to have elected to work a 25-
hour day by adding the Arts Council
to his obligations to radio and tele-
vision, authorship, anti-hanging groups,
law, and the lecture rooms of La Trobe
University.
The assumption is that the Council
for the Arts will function as a deter-
minedly part-time body, with even the
interests of its chairman, Dr. H. C.
Coombs, divided between arts, Abor-
iginal affairs, and the Chancellorship of
the Australian National University. The
question now is: will any of the coun-
cillors have time to listen to the artistic
petitioners, pressure groups, crackpots,
and idealists whose needs they have
been chosen to study? Without the
benefit of an inquiry into artistic prob-
lems and priorities to guide it, the
part-time council already seems remote
from the essentials of its functions.
Dr. Coombs has wisely sought not
to have active artistic practitioners
around him at the council table, but it
is clear that he will need them on com-
mittees close to him if he is to get
more than an academic view of some
of the urgent movements in artistic
endeavor now taking place in Australia.
As the Council doesn’t have to raise
money only distribute the Common-
wealth’s its membership is fortu-
nately free of stockbrokers, industrial-
ists, charitable socialites, and wealthy
dilettantes. Neither is it as unwieldy as
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust’s. But
its composition doesn’t suggest that it
is about to do any more than the Trust
in raising Australia’s cultural climate.


Theatre
Depth beyond
the laughter
By REX CRAMRHORNE
Loot. Joe Orton. Independent Theatre,
Sydney.
The Porcelain Year. Reginald Rose.
Ensemble Theatre.
GIVEN DIALOGUE as brilliant as Joe
Orton’s, a production of “Loot” is a
pleasure not to be missed. The wit
spreads and proliferates with its own
energy, indulging in virtuoso displays,
which invite comparison with great
stylists of the past Wilde, perhaps,
or Wycherley and the harsher comedy
of the Restoration. For the dazzling
surface is shaped by a very fierce look
at humanity. Religion, morality, justice,
and social order are all ruthlessly flouted
in a play in which the innocent suffer
and the guilty triumph. The strongest
and most sustained protest in the play
is made against the brutality and cor-
ruption of power.
And so, at the end of “Loot,” as a
harmless, upright old man is dragged
away by the police (“I’m innocent! I’m
innocent! Oh, what a terrible thing
to happen to a man who’s been kissed
by the Pope.”) the law shakes hands
with crime in happy anarchy.
The Independent’s production (Ken
Whiteley) takes the dialogue along at
a spanking pace, while maintaining
sufficient clarity to do it justice. This
is achieved at some cost to other aspects
of the actors’ performances: vocal
control is sometimes lost and there is
a general sense of strain and effort
in thumping the comedy out at the
audience. More seriously, the ideas on
which the dialogue is based tend to
become obscured. The action of this
play implies that, provided appearances
are kept up, we can live as we please;
that no accepted convention of social
or moral order is anything more than
“appearances”; that anyone old or silly
enough to think otherwise is ruthlessly
crushed. We lose the impact of these
premises if we can’t see past the dialogue
and surface humor.
The same problem occurs elsewhere
in the production. Tony Thurbon’s
treatment of the central character,
Truscott, gives us a cleverly built-up
surface of tics, moustaches, and vaude-
ville gymnastics which are extremely
funny. But the effort involved in su-
staining them obscures the strength
and menace of a man who jerks Hal
from the floor, beating and kicking and
punching him until he screams with
pain.
To a lesser extent, the same thing
must be said of Hal (Ross Thompson)
and Dennis (Peter Rowley): their
sketchy accents and uncommitted
characterisations seem to result from
too conscious an effort to play the
comedy. Bettina Welch, as Fay, has
the same faults, but has them with
such determined exuberance that one
is inclined to forget that the balance
of the play would probably be truer
with a rather less vividly theatrical
nurse. James Condon’s restrained and
natural performance as McLeavy, how-
ever, is so right that it makes one
more aware than ever that this play
is no extravagant farce, and that it
needs as much care and attention to
detail as is generally given to Pinter.
In keeping with the production’s
general concentration on the surface at
the expense of the content, Ken White-
ley has decided to follow the Lord
Chamberlain in pulling some of the
play’s sharper teeth. It seems to me
absolutely imperative that the body of
Mrs. McLeavy be played by an actress
the shock of inhumanity and indif-
ference is kept within comfortable
limits if a dummy is all that is involved.
And why should wiping the casket that
contained “my mum’s guts” not leave
stains on the handkerchief? “Loot” is
not a parlor game but an assault on
hypocritical “appearances.”
“Loot” is a funny play that turns out
to be serious. “The Porcelain Year,” at
the Ensemble, is a serious play that
turns out to be funny or at least it’s
very hard to take it seriously.
In the Potters’ eighteenth (porcelain)
year of marriage, mother’s moment of
sexual infidelity is witnessed by
daughter, Lizzie. In Act 2 Lizzie tells
daddy, and the rest of the play gives
us the ensuing brawl. We find that there
have been faults on both sides, and
Rosemary Jones, Chuck Faulkner in
“The Porcelain Year”
Harold and Alice come to realise (they
congratulate themselves on their intelli-
gence) that for some years now they
haven’t been giving much to or, con-
versely, getting much from one another.
Clearly they can both do a good deal
better in future, and Harold decides
not to leave Alice, Lizzie, and Fred
after all.
This material is played for real by
the production, and most of the cast
are asked to get rather worked up
about it. Such intentional humor as the
play contains is largely based on the
well-established American tradition of
giving the laugh lines to the nine-year-
old son. Under the circumstances, Don
Reid, as Harold, manages to sound
fairly natural, but the women (Rose-
mary Jones, as Alice, and Lyndal Moor,
as Lizzie) mainly tended to register
distress and other emotions by zooming
up in pitch to levels that threaten to
exceed the range of the human ear.
Chuck Faulkner does well enough with
the “not crude—just direct” seducer.
However, the production (David
Dawson) never really manages to
animate the moral puppets that the
author (Reginald Rose) has devised.
Whenever they try to touch one another
whether it be to gingerly remove
Alice’s brassiere, or to shake sense into
tiresome Lizzie—the fact that what they
are doing is not real suddenly becomes
painfully obvious. The concentration
and close range of Ensemble staging
doesn’t let one make allowances: any-
thing that doesn’t work is a major
embarrassment.
Well, this “stark and dramatic” treat-
ment of infidelity is designed, a direc-
tor’s note tells us, both to entertain and
to give “food for thought.” Perhaps if
you have gone to the Ensemble with
someone else’s wife, or frequently ques-
tion your husband’s fidelity, this play
may get through to you on the con-
science of the king principle. But then
a newspaper account of a divorce or
any accidentally relevant incident could
do that. Presumably a play that “chal-
lenges the pretences of marriage today”
should offer a more detailed treatment
of the theme.
In “Loot,” the humor of the dialogue
revealed and, just by being funny, com-
mented on the shocking nature of the
action. In “The Porcelain Year” the
dialogue is of such stunning flatness (at
the crisis of confrontation: “Alice . . .
is this true?”) that one can only try to
accept it as a literal-minded attempt
at realism and turn back to the action.
All the emphasis of the play, its only
justification, is in its moral, and I’m
afraid it seems to me an inadequate
little motto to get from more than two
hours of material.
All this would hardly be worth con-
sidering at such length were it not
interesting to have it demonstrated so
clearly that a macabre comedy can be
more moral than a play whose earnest
moralising is its only point. And that
presenting plays with messages is not
the only way for a theatre to be rele-
vant.


Sharing the guilt
By PHILLIP ADAMS
The Man in the Glass Booth. Robert
Shaw. Melbourne Theatre Company.
TO THE confusion of those gentile
liberals who’ve long enjoyed romantic-
ising the Jews, Israel has recaptured the
militancy of the Macabees. And a new,
defiant generation of Jews, with no
patience for cheek-turning, has set out
to hunt down the Eichmanns and, by
symbolically trying them, remind the
Germans of their collective guilt.
When the world tut-tutted at the
evidence at Eichmann’s trial both
Jewish and gentile writers were moved
to protest at the implicit smugness, re-
minding us that, under similar circum-
stances, other nations would have goose-
stepped and butchered as efficiently as
the Germans. And even among the ex-
treme Left there was concern that the
trial was merely primitive vengeance.
Robert Shaw has borrowed certain
images from Eichmann’s trial, but re-
fracts and distorts them so as to
further complicate the issues. He even
dares to suggest that Israel itself would
have responded to the mystique of a
Hitler, and that Jews have the same
capacity for bestiality as any gentile.
He doesn’t in any way minimise the
ghastliness of the Final Solution. He is
simply unwilling to allow humanity to
unload its guilt solely on the Germans.
“The Man in the Glass Booth” is too
clever and difficult for pat analysis. I
don’t think that its plot should be
discussed, as a large extent of the play
is dependent on a series of shocks. But
this much can be said: it is a portrait of
a man who may be Goldman, a New
York Jewish millionaire. Or he may
be the Nazi Colonel Adolph Dorff.
Whoever he is (and he may even be
both men), he allows himself to be
captured by Israeli agents. In the course
of his interrogation and trial he is re-
vealed as a character of bewildering
complexity, possessed of an insane but
illuminating sense of irony. In fact,
Goldman-Dorff is a living sick joke, and
for much of the play we are forced to
laugh at his black wit and brilliant
bitterness. Like a Marquis de Sade (or
a Lenny Bruce), he inverts morality to
jolt our beliefs, and if the technique
brings more confusion than enlighten-
ment, there’s no question as to its power.
John Summner’s production is a flam-
boyant one, dominated by Raymond
Westwell’s performance as Goldman-
Dorff. The character is far more con-
fused than a mere schizophrenic, yet
Westwell plays it brilliantly right down
to the finest details of accent.
I find myself unsure of the ultimate
significance of this play, as I shared the
audience’s puzzlement with much of its
obscure, nihilistic argument. However,
like the Marat-Sade dialogue, the strange
'Goldman-Dorff monologue demands that
you think, and think again.
Communicating
FACTS AND OPINIONS ON ARTS,
CRAFTS AND COMMUNICATIONS
IS THIS A HOLD-UP?
BANKING IS, without question, the
most dour and conservative of profes-
sions. And banks were traditionally the
bleakest and most forbidding of build-
ings. Then along came Motivation Re-
search and bankers learned that as far
as customer goodwill went, they were
somewhat in the red.
So, uneasily, they set about revamp-
ing banking’s image, which involved let-
ting sunlight into dank, Gothic build-
ings and teaching branch managers to
force an occasional smile. Along with
the new architecture and pretty pass-
books, Australian banks commissioned
cheery new television commercials. One
bank had Spike Milligan depositing
bananas, another chose scottie dogs as
its corporate symbol, while the Com-
monwealth, inspired by the tigers in
Esso’s tanks, put elephants in its banks.
Now, after a decade of this unac-
customed frivolity, the Commonwealth
apparently has had enough. Or, perhaps,
a piece of motivation research has
detected a yearning among its custom-
ers for the authoritarian bank of yester-
year. Whatever the reason, the Com-
monwealth’s new telly commercial is a
grim piece of Gothic imagery. One by
one customers are placed in a huge,
echoing courtroom worthy of a Kafka.
Dwarfed by immense furniture they
cower below an unseen judge who
accuses them of financial idiocies in a
God-like basso profundo. They plead
not guilty and are acquitted, but you
get tbe feeling it was a close thing. Not
only is' there no sign of a jury, but
when the announcer says “Get with
the strength” at the commercial’s end,
one detects a note of threat.
AUTHORS CONSOLIDATING
THEY’RE at it again. Hardly had
the seminar habitues recovered from
the critics’ bash in Sydney a week or
so ago when brochures began arriving,
luring them away to the Society of
Authors’ next seminar, to be held in
Melbourne beginning June 25. Peter
Mathers, just back from England,
Tony Morphett and Thomas Keneally
will talk on fiction, Chris. Wallace-
Crabbe and Rodney Hall on poetry,
Tim Burstall and Phillip Adams on
mass media, and Patrick Tennison,
Robert Amos, and Peter Grose will
tell you how to sell your stuff.
The seminar will coincide with the
society’s fifth birthday. Five years ago
37 people attended the first meeting;
now there are 500 members.
The society is fairly happy with the
provisions of the Copyright Bill, de-
bated last week in the House of
Representatives, as they affect authors.
The Bill finally gets Australian authors,
a patient lot, the full protection of the
Universal Copyright Convention of
1952, which America signed, and the
Berne Copyright Convention of 1886
with its later amendments, which
America has never signed. Australia’s
last Act dealing with copyright was
passed in 1912 when films hardly exis-
ted and television did not.
SPILLING FOR PROGRESS
TELEVISION continues to force a
spillage of craftsmen whose talents it
has cultivated. Ultimately, the very
fascination of the medium frustrates
its most urgent apostles. There are
dozens of creative young men and
women in TV who just know they can
use electronic wizardry to make a
meaningful impact — if only, as they
say, managements weren’t so blind,
money was plentiful, and someone
would give them a go. The wail of their
thwarted ambitions can be heard from
Channel 0 to Channel 13, but when
they stop feeling sorry for them-
selves some of them get up and go it
alone: their spillage has created a pool
of capable communicators who are
loosely forming into a subsidiary in-
dustry of TV-oriented film-makers.
Among the latest to surface, clear-
eyed, from a bog of anecdotes about
the bloodiness of trying to get any-
thing done in television is John Abbott,
who made a number of telling docu-
mentaries for the “Project” series
(“Images of Australia,” “The Other
Germany,” etc.) and who now heads a
Sydney-based film production house
called Studio Two. He has begun mak-
ing TV commercials, industrial docu-
mentaries, and short documentary
features. This week he has a unit in the
Northern Territory trailing a safari of
speedboat drivers who are hauling their
boats across the top of Australia to race
them in competition at Mt. Isa and
Darwin, with buffalo hunting and
crocodile shooting as incidental activi-
ties along the way. “We’re shooting in
color for wide-screen cinema distri-
bution and we’re very hopeful of having
NBC arrange for a color TV release
in North America,”
Last week he invited friends and
advertising agency people to his Bal-
main studio in the Cinesound building
to look at his first two industrial docu-
mentaries — one a summary soft-sell
for an Australian chemical research
company, the other a brash but effec-
tive hard-sell film shot at a convention
of Tupperware sales staff in Mel-
bourne, a coincidentally startling study
of how American sales techniques are
being pushed into Australian homes.

Art
Confrontation
By ELWYN LYNN
Group Two, Gallery A, Sydney.
Mirka Mora, Watters Gallery, Sydney.
Gordon Shepherdson, Rudy Komon
Gallery, Sydney.
Tony McGillick, Central Street Gallery,
Sydney.
David Aspden, Blaxland Gallery, Syd-
ney.
FIVE REALISTS of a kind, almost
fantasts, confront two new abstraction-
ists, so similar in approach that their
detractors can rally their jaded spirits
by crying Internationals Anonymous
and point to the isosceles triangle can-
vas, with two corners removed, that
Aspden and McGillick use; but, after
all, it’s what goes on within the shape
that counts, and no one objects to artists
sharing rectangular shapes.
In the Gallery A group show, two
newcomers command attention: Guy
Stuart (b. 1944), who has just won
the Ballarat Crouch Prize, makes a play
of varied ellipses in Elliptical Lip View
Vat presented in unfashionably lush
blues, crimsons, and reds that have an
air of romanticism suffering from
Baconian neurosis. The Baconian influ-
ence is more obvious in the beautifully
painted Corrugated Surfaces, where
something strange seems trapped in the
green shade. The other, Andrew Nott
(b. 1947), uses flat, sourish, cool pinks,
blues, and greens except where he
modulates a hand, a head, or a body
which are isolated with a Magritte
decisiveness in a pleasant void. Mag-
ritte in icing sugar it may be, but
the sponge-rock head of the girl floats
into the pastel blue with a queer sweet-
ness, while her hands turn into bouquets
a little like her lost head: a sweet girl
who loses her head in such an odd way.
There’s nothing creepy about the
whimsy especially in the drawings
of Mirka Mora, who, true Melburnian,
ties her works to the myth of Erich-
thonius, which simply supplies the tame
snake whose lazy curves match those of
the innocent pink-and-white babes and
angels watched over by a crow that
appears as a gold or white duck. The
'snake, sometimes like the background
and the crow, patterned in gold leaf,
holds the works together; if you don’t
care for Chinese-red lacquer and gold-
leafed boxes, then the drawings in char-
coal and pastel have the same easy
cursiveness and joyous levitation. Enter-
taining, quite unmetaphysical, they
treat myth lightly.
Shepherdson loves the dark, meta-
physical void through which his lovers
fall; gloom enshrouds his Nolanesque
lighthorseman, his bulls, and his Black-
man girls. A little brown-red lightens
his Violinist on a Hillside with its
Molvigian turbulence, but it’s the Goya-
esque haze through which Dead Lover
Dreaming and The Deciding Lover,
whose flesh seems tattooed with the
drifting smoke, that haunts the mind
with images of gloomy fate.
There’s nothing dark and undefined
in Aspden — 1 born, like Shepherdson, in
1935—and McGillick (b. 1941). Aspden
exploits what happens with vast hori-
zontal or relentlessly diagonal bands; in
Field 1 a diagonal divides one half
into black and the other into bands of
dark blue, brick-red, orange, and a
'yellow at the corner that lifts the flat
roof off. Wave Front, 22ft. long, encloses
in a crimson band a purple diamond
so placed in a dingy black oblong that
its top and bottom apexes are cut. The
effect is a powerful tug between the
escaping edges and the central points of
the diamond, which want to invade the
black on left and right. In Fifth Force,
20ft. long, an orange band on unin-
flected blue suddenly dips in a V in the
centre as though to drive through the
floor, but is cut off with a suddenness
that makes the painting shiver.
McGillick is a tougher formalist and
more dramatic colorist in his modular
paintings, where the same shapes of
almost equal weight battle it out or lie
down in uneasy juxtaposition. Most
peaceful is the faded gold of Juxjacent,
made of two equal rectangles with their
ends diagonally sheared off. Others are
composed of the trimmed isosceles tri-
angles referred to above and the balance
between discriminating calculation and
intuition gives them a levitation and
expansion not found in Aspden. In
Monitor a black triangle drives down
alongside a black square from which it
has escaped, but a purple band encircles
them both. Easy Chrome, a triangle
with three apexes sliced off, is a subtle
balance of parallel stripes that switch
into a happy, pale yellow and chrome
square, but most subtle and powerful is
the dark grey Skin Deep, where two of
his near-triangles balance precariously,
the top one containing its ultramarine
letting triangle, but the bottom one
letting its ultramarine triangle escape,
heralding the collapse of the whole. If
you have ever inhabited a polygonal
room, you’ll realise how intriguing is the
balance between these equally shaped
modules. The recent work of Aspden,
Watkins, McGillick, Schlicht, and Ball
has suddenly crystallised the situation
of new abstraction into something per-
sonal and dazzlingly varied.
Film festival
Just too many "masterpieces"
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
MUCH AS I approve of film festi-
vals in principle, in practice they’re
overpowering; with the current one
still having several days to run, I’m
beginning to feel as overfed as a Stras-
bourg goose. I don’t think this force-
feeding of films impairs the critical
faculty, but it does leave you longing
for a night off.
Nobody but a superman could see
every film shown, and there are diffi-
cult choices to make—the program
notes make everything sound like a
masterpiece. I elected to see “Young
Toerless” rather than “Hunger,” and
am afraid I made the wrong choice.
Volkei Schloendorff s film is expeitly
made, but curiously chilly in its treat-
ment of Musil s story of a pre-war
German military academy, a forcing
bed foi young Nazis. I m getting a
• n • . German habit of
inflicting everyone else with their guilt,
especially when they are so low-spiiited
about it.
Of the two Japanese films seen so
far, Kobayashi’s “Rebellion” is a stylish,
beautiful film set in the days of the
feudal lords. The formalised, almost
balletic treatment never obscures the
fierce human emotions of the charac-
ters, beautiful black-and-white photog-
raphy, and a fine cast headed by the
faultless Tochiro Mifune. Teshigahara’s
“The Face of Another” probed the
problem of personal identity, the exact
relationship between a man’s spirit and
his outward appearance. Despite this
interesting central idea it was affected
and overlong.
Widerberg’s poetic “Elvira Madigan”
( t 0 be reviewed more fully later) and
“How I Won The War” are both fine
and idiosyncratic pieces of film-making.
“China Is Near” is idiosyncratic, all
right. But, like his earlier “Fists In
The Pocket,” Bellochio made it too
deliberately eccentric and removed from
reality to be particularly moving.
But spe aking of removal from
rea i itys the festival une arthed one of its
most weird and wonderful offerings in
Franju’s “Judex,” a “homage” to the
1914 serial movies of Feuillade. Appar-
entl these have been taken up by the
intelligentsia in the same way as “Bat-
man.” There’s not much homage in the
film, which Franju and his cast
obviously enjoyed hugely. Presumably,
the movie was unanimously awarded a
prize at a European festival, because the
judges—like the greater part of the
Sydney audience—were relieved to be
able to sit back and enjoy themselves
irresponsibly. I have read a solemn
review in ‘Sight and Sound” full of
references to “Franju’s private vision”
and the “snow and velvet photography”;
this must make Franju laugh even more
heartily than his film did me.

RINGMASTER OF
THE 'NEW STATESMAN'
CIRCUS
By MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE
Editor. Kingsley Martin. Hutchinson.
$7.00.
THE FIRST volume of Kingsley Mar-
tin’s autobiography (“Father Figures”)
covered the years 1897-1931, and ended
with his appointment to the editorship
of the “New Statesman.” This second
volume is concerned almost exclusively
with how he came to shape the maga-
zine’s policy as he did through the
’thirties and into the war years.
It is, in other words, an incomparable
anatomy of the Left. Whoever wants
to know in the future how the Left
worked, where it gathered its strength
and whence it derived its fatuities, will
find it all here. Kingsley Martin in his
heyday was the Left incarnate; each
press day he was crucified for the sins,
and deficiencies of mankind, each Mon-
day he rose again to bring out another
issue.
Journalistically speaking, it was a
great success. Under his editorship, the
“New Statesman” was a sort of Nancy
Brigg of egghead journalism, eating up
successively most of its competitors
the “Nation,” the “Weekend Review,”
etc. Its circulation went up steadily
from 12,000 when he took over to some
90,000, where it seems to have stuck.
(The saints or elect of the Left are,
presumably, stationary at around about
this figure.) Even advertising has in-
creased; the high priests of capitalism
in the shape of IGI and Shell have
thought it worth while to buy space from
their most literate, and sometimes most
waspish, adversary. Kingsley Martin was
able to hand over to his successor, John
Freeman, an enterprise that was financi-
ally, as well as ideologically, flourishing.
It would be idle for me to pretend
that I can take a detached view of
K.M.’s account of his conduct of the
“New Statesman.” I remember the
very first issue plopping on our door-
mat,- my father being an original
subscriber; the very first piece of mine
ever to be printed now nearly half
a century ago appeared in its
columns, as did, subsequently, some of
the pieces which gave me most satis-
faction to write. I have read it con-
sistently over the years, sometimes to
the accompaniment of loud cries of
rage and anguish. It’s part of the social
history of our time the arena in
which the liberal conscience has
wrestled with the dragon of power,
sometimes aiming shrewd pellets, some-
times overthrown, and in the end,
alas, riding off triumphantly on the
dragon’s back.
For this circus Kingsley Martin was
an ideal ceremonial ringmaster; in an
age of active liberal consciences his
was the most active of all of posi-
tively Vesuvian dimensions. At the
same time, he possessed a vein of
shrewdness, an awareness of how this
wicked old world works, which enabled
him to establish some sort of under-
standing with the dragon without
ostensibly mitigating its ferocity.
It is interesting to note, in this con-
nection, that in the continuing dialogue
which K.M. carried on with Keynes
(the numerous extracts from it
included in “Editor” provide some of
its most fascinating pages) he, the
sea-green incorruptible, more often
than not took the practical and, in
worldly terms, sensible position,
whereas the future salvage officer-in-
chief of the capitalist system was the
scatty, starry-eyed one. What, for
instance, could have been more naive,
or for that matter ignoble, than
Keynes’ recommendation at the time
of Munich that we should “bluff to
the hilt, and if the bluff is called, back
out”? How much more plausible was
Kingsley Martin’s version of the same
doctrine in a “New Statesman” edi-
torial on August 27, 1938: “The stra-
tegical value of the Bohemian frontier
should not be made the occasion of a
world war. We should not guarantee
the status quo!” It is true that a few
days later “The Times” came out with
an article in the same sense, the two
towers of our citadel, on the Left and
on the Right, both flying the white
flag.
Kingsley Martin now feels that,
though the point he made was cor-
rect, he chose “a disastrous moment”
to make it. Perhaps, as Talleyrand
observed, in matters of this kind timing
is everything. Even so, his instinct, it
seems to me, was correct by compari-
son with Keynes’ completely fatuous
notion of a bluff that could not pos-
sibly work. Once again he spoke for
his flock, who, like Leon Blum, had
feelings “divided between shame and
cowardly relief” when Chamberlain
made his infamous deal with Hitler,
Mussolini, and Daladier.
If, then, K.M.’s account of his
editorship of the “New Statesman”
fails to establish him as either a saint
or a seer (the Walter Mitty roles of
all Leftists), it does make clear how
brilliant a journalist he has been
one of the most brilliant of our time.
His “London Diary,” contributed week
by week over many years, provides a
splendid commentary on the passing
scene, as reflected in a muddled, well-
meaning, exuberant, and congenitally
contemporary mind, at once too right-
eous to be cynical, and too cynical to
be righteous. The writing itself is
serviceable rather than brilliant, but
has the inestimable quality of being
Kingsley Martin . .. liberal conscience
always readable. I was astonished to
find, in a recently published volume of
extracts, how well the “Diary” stands
up to the test of time, how admirably
it still conveys the happenings, people,
and dilemmas which were its subject
matter.
In a way, autobiography is a mis-
nomer for “Editor,” it tells us very
little about its author’s personal life,
and even his friendships with Shaw,
H. G. Wells, the Webbs, and other
pillars of the Left Establishment ■ —
were more in the way of business than
true intimacies for their own delight.
They yielded, one feels, more para-
graphs than affection. (Dorothy Wood-
man, let me hasten to add, is an
obvious exception. Though they have
worked together professionally, his
warm tribute to their long companion-
ship is, as all their friends are well
aware, utterly deserved.)
In a quite unique way his life has
been lived in terms of public events,
and emotions, rather than private ones.
At each Station of the Cross of our
time the Depression, the Spanish
Civil War, Munich, the Nazi-Soviet
Pact he has stood to beat his
breast, and offer up his prayer, and
then pushed eagerly, even joyously, on
to the next. It was, I think, J. B.
Priestley who once remarked that there
never had been so cheerful a Cas-
sandra.
If what are commonly regarded as
the forces of progress on a wide
front from instant abortion to total
disarmament, and world government —
ultimately triumph, then Kingsley Mar-
tin will seem to have been one of a
host of mini-Moseses leading us to
our promised land. If, on the other


hand, their outcome is disaster and
darkness, then he will be seen as par-
taking of the unconscious death wish
which brought it about. In either case
he will be a significant figure, and his
autobiography a useful and interesting
addition to the age’s documentation.
ALIENATING PRESSURES
By NANCY KEESING
Meetings with Poets. Jack Lindsay.
Muller. $5.05.
IN THIS valuable book five poets,
all known to the author, are presented
in informal autobiographical essays.
Edith Sitwell and Dylan Thomas are
discussed at some length, while three
French poets, Louis Aragon, Paul
Eluard, and Tristan Tzara, are con-
sidered together against their turbulent
background of the French Occupation,
and Resistance, and of stylistic experi-
ment. Being ignorant of these French
writers, Aragon’s novels excepted, I
am grateful for the introduction, and
especially to Tzara. Lindsay prints his
own translations of some of their work
these seem excellent: Edith Sitwell
thought them so.
One need not share Lindsay’s
Marxist views to find his arguments
about poetry, and about politics in
poetry (politics being understood in
a very wide sense), stimulating, and
illuminating. Lindsay asserts that
poetry “if it be true poetry” (my
italics) “expresses in its own vital unity
the wholeness of the individual, even
in a situation where that individual
and his society are rent by the most
terrible of alienating pressures.” He
claims that each of the five poets here
“in his or her own way” does exemplify
this view, and each of the essays, at
core, is a demonstration of Lindsay’s
belief.
“Last Words With Dylan” will be
of great interest to anyone who read
the tragic, and sometimes hysterical,
literature that followed Thomas’ death.
It is also, being judicious and objective,
a valuable corrective to some distorted
versions. Lindsay’s analysis of Dylan
and Caitlin feels so right in the context
of Thomas’ poetry that some interpret-
ations here seem almost inspired. One
might prefer to agree with Robert
Graves and Norman Cameron (see
Graves’ essay “And the Children’s
Teeth are Set on Edge”). One might
feel thankful to have been spared the
acquaintance of those anguished, violent
people in the flesh. But I think Lindsay
has made it impossible to accept almost
all other views, and his interpretations
of Dylan’s personality are invaluable
enhancements of his poetry.
“Edith Sitwell in London” is the
longest essay in the book. Lindsay had
some direct influence upon this poet
in the last ten years or so of her
productive life, and for this reason
alone the piece is important. But, in
ways too numerous to categorise here,
it seems more arguable than “Last
Words with Dylan.” The portrait of
Edith Sitwell is fuzzy at the edges.
In saying this, I must establish my
belief that Edith Sitwell is a poet of
towering achievement and vision whose
work, despite the recognition it won
during her life, is still too close to us
for any proper comprehension of all
its mysterious and prophetic splendor.
One obscuring factor among many
is, I am sure, the “Sitwell thing”
the family glamor and the Beaton por-
traits, which often cause wrong empha-
sis. Of course, the work of other major
poets has suffered from distortions of
lifetime legend, from Shelley to Yeats
to Thomas himself. But with Edith Sit-
well there is an important difference
which is chiefly due to the accidents
of sex and family. Does this book
wrongly emphasise those factors which,
even in cold print, arouse all Lindsay’s
gallantry on her behalf? Her physical
frailties? Her inner diffidence which
led her to be so “highly susceptible to
flattery”? Her helplessness before the
hosts of lame ducks and hangers-on
which dissipated her energy, fed on her
emotions and undoubtedly (as Elizabeth
Salter in “Last Years of a Rebel,” also
made plain) wasted her time?
It might be pertinent to ask, rather,
whether many of Edith Sitwell’s crosses
were not subconsciously sought and
gladly carried. Almost all great poets
have seemed to need outlets it is
as if it is impossible for genius to per-
form at its hottest and most inspired for
too long at a time, and those who have
so pushed their genius have often died
young. Drink, drugs, desperate or un-
popular causes, travel, hopeless loves,
and even demanding pedestrian jobs
have served to damp the fires in others.
Dame Edith’s dampers being impec-
cable and dreary are here interpreted
very differently and, perhaps, wrongly.
So while with the Thomas essay one
feels that for the first time the right
questions have been posed and the best
answers found, the Sitwell section is
Jack Lindsay . .. valuable corrective
less convincing. Partly this may be due
to Lindsay’s urgent gallantry, partly to
a number of correspondences between
these rebels, one English and one Aus-
tralian. Certainly much of the sympathy
that grew between them stemmed from
their curiously similar searches for
independent identities. Whatever a
reader’s view, however, Lindsay’s actual
material and his quotations from Dame
Edith’s letters to himself will have to
be considered by all subsequent students
of Edith Sitwell’s life and work.
BUT WHAT FRINGE?
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
A Fringe of Blue. Joice NanKivell
Loch. Murray. $5.30.
THERE ARE A number of disturbing
and paradoxical elements about “A
Fringe of Blue.* It purports to be an
autobiography but it reads more like a
travel-book (the author was born in
Australia but has lived abroad since
the end of World War I); she becomes
attached to the Quaker Mission to
Poland, but she is not a Friend (and
scarcely an acquaintance); she seems
driven to good works, not out of any
sense of vocation, but out of some sort
of daredevilry; she benignly consigns
the night to “little thieves owls,
mice, and poverty-stricken man” when
the poverty-stricken man is Pole, Arab,
or Greek, but when he is Jew he is
merely “dishonest”; she writes a whole
section on refugees to Palestine without
once mentioning the Jews there . . .
quite a feat in itself.
Mrs. Loch’s highly dramatic tale of
an Australian bush childhood, obviously
angled at the non-Aussie reader,
includes some odd syntax: “The native
bear or koala, clinging to his gum
branch; his absurd tufted ears erect;
his over-large foolish black nose.” (End
of sentence.) One might also easily
gain the impression that “the wombats;
the platypus; the bellbirds; whipbirds;
bowerbirds; lyrebirds. Thousands of
black swan, beating the air with their
wings,” were her constant little play-
mates if one did not know better. The
story that intrigued me most was the
“true” naming of Canberra: according
to her we have all been taken for a
ride (or given our just deserts, which-
ever way you look at it), and the word
is not Aboriginal at all some fellow
on the site was simply demanding a
can of beer!
While there can be no doubt that
she deliberately 'sought adventure out
and found it everywhere, an Australian
may not be able to help wondering
how much of the other exotic territoi'y
covered, where it would be difficult to
question (such as pre-war Poland, post-
revolutionary Russia, and a remote part
of Greece where she now resides in a
Byzantine tower), has been painted in
the same broad, oversimplified poster
colors. She brings most of the people
around her very much alive in vivid
print, there is a glowing picture of her


brother who died in World War I, but
her husband, Sydney Loch, her com-
panion in good works, never emerges
as a personality in his own right, and
his death is casually passed over in
parentheses. Above all, one is left with
a doubt about what the author herself
was after in life, whether she achieved
it, whether she felt fulfilled. She had
started off with a desire to be a writer,
had some early success, but finished
acting as midwife to monsters and by
sewing together frightful wounds with
primitive threads at the end of nowhere.
Mrs. Loch has a way with words of
the vicarious travelogue, armchair-
adventurer kind, and thrills and anec-
dotes abound. She sails into mined
harbors, boards a German staff plane
in wartime by mistake, witnesses a
Greek peasant cheating the Virgin by
“legitimate” means, helps a woman
give birth to a hare, tells of miracles,
the supernatural, of Xerxes’ sunken
galleons, of man’s inhumanity to man.
Many readers will, no doubt, find it
absorbing reading, escape disguised as
participation, and possibly not every-
one will be left, as this reviewer, with
an unpleasant, scarcely definable after-
taste lingering on the palate.
THE SAWDUST PILE
By JIM SHARMAN
The Rise and Fall of the Well-made
Play. John Russell Taylor. Methuen.
$5.15.
I HAVE always found John Russell
Taylor a bit of a bandwagoner
(“Anger and After,” kitchen-sink
drama wagon; “Cinema Eye Cinema
Ear,” new-wave cinema wagon; “Art
Nouveau in Britain,” Beardsley wagon,
etc), so it is odd, yet symbolic, to find
his second theatre book conforming to
the currently popular “Theatre is a
Museum,” “trying to make the media
of the old do the work of the new,”
etc.-McLuhan wagon.
The function of the well-made play
is to tell a story, a story with a begin-
ning, a middle, and an end (statement,
exposition, conclusion), a formal
framework in which a naturalistic slice
of life is worked through to its logical
conclusion. Like most of Taylor’s books,
this one is concerned solely with the
English scene and, after a quick
reference to the French beginnings of
the form with Scribe and Sardou,
passes on to the basis of the English
■“well-made” (as opposed to a Duchamp
■“ready-made”) with Tom Robertson.
It was Robertson’s play “Caste”
(1867) which took the furniture off
the painted backcloths and represented
its three-dimensional reality by plac-
ing it on the stage, so commencing the
British theatre’s preoccupation with
trivia that has eaten the theatrical
woodwork for the past century and
left us with the sawdust pile it is
today. The author sketches out its
progress through Pinero, Wilde, Shaw,
Maugham, Coward to Rattigan, and
ends with a dubiously hasty relation
of “The Way We Live Now” to the
well-made format.
It is unfortunate that the “well-
made” tradition has taken over the
structure of the book and each of
the eleven chapters reveals an alarm-
ingly symmetrical structure. A relation
to the past, a synopsis of a few plots, a
tentative link with the next playwright,
and on to the next chapter. This
formula construction produces a
tedium inclining this reader to think
the book hastily constructed despite
the impressive bibliography appended
(a feature of all Taylor’s books).
That opinion is furthered by con-
stant subjective intervention and per-
sonal preference for particular authors
and plays that pervades the book and
makes it insufficiently documented for
serious academic interest, and too bor-
ing for general reading. Indeed, the
book viewed in perspective seems to
trace a direct line of development, and
the lack of any feeling of period or
relation to social perspective would give
a naive reader the distinct impression
that there was no significant difference
between the writings of any of the
playwrights represented.
Taylor indicates his book is loosely
derived from the remark of a woman
at an avant-garde drama conference
“who just wanted a good laugh, a good
cry, and either way a good story in
the theatre” (obviously Rattigan’s
“Aunt Edna” neatly disguised in a
mini-shift with a copy of “Nova”
under her arm). This thought moti-
vates Taylor’s prevailing thesis “why
shouldn’t a play be well made.” Well,
if theatre is supposed to be the magic
mirror of life and not just “the media
of the old” et al., the obvious reason
is because we no longer live well-made
lives, and though they might have a
beginning, a middle, and an end they
don’t necessarily occur in that order.
IN THE PLACE OF WILD HONEY
Back after five weeks away I find
my yard drowned in a flood of weeds,
filled with the fluff of their fertility,
mined
for nectar by corpulent birds whose
greed
may excel ours. The grass I mow, and
leave
the tall stalks, thistle and burr in seed.
Caught in the grass, my wife might be
Eve
afraid now of the snake crawling on
her belly,
tearful for the glory which could easily
deceive.
I enter our perforated iron and smelly
toilet to find it infested with red-backs,
each holding in his shiny black bag of
jelly
with jocular red stripe, a quiet sac
of darkening liquor. I take some pine,
poise
and splash his spirit through the cracks.
Our hot Siamese makes the harsh noise
in her chest and throat and holds her-
self tense,
raising her tail, haunches high for the
joys
that do not pierce through her dense
mazed quiver of tendons. I stroke her
hard
but my hand only serves to confound
her sense.
We roll in sweat and the sometime bard
is stiflled in the spume of heat. My
bare wife
types for me, her breasts occasionally
jarred
by her palm, as she slaps to a pulp the
rife
powder-winged moths which flutter and
itch
as they stick. The air spawns with life
and swirls white in the low sun over
the ditch
of rank grass. On the tar road I swerved
to miss a great lizard, painted in rich
orange, ochre, and black on bark. Our
precarious curved
path crossed where he had been, and
our ears
rustled with loose skin. His short legs
just served.
Whitsunday, 1851. A fire sears
the native camp, as white men shoot
and freeze
the naked men sleeping rugged with
minor fears,
where the race for ages robbed the bees
of cloying honey in white combs. Now
the frost
whitens their black hair as we break
their knees.
Our records show their numbers
dwindled. The cost
of intercourse with whites was birth
without joy. The women killed the
bairns and all lost.
I dig with my hands in the fragrant
earth
and replace the cut trees by a blue pine.
Thistles and cat-head burrs with some
mirth
puncture my Japanese thongs, and a fine
blond needle mists under my skin. The
dearth
is gone, and paspalum exudes ergot like
wine.
Gelignite shatters the Jurassic sandstone
to dust
and the roaring hopper gouges to splin-
ters the skull
of a giant wombat, wallowing out its
gust
of breath. Its grave is now the square
hull
of the Shire Pool. My blood heats again
with the lust
he knew. And after, our hearts slow to
a dull
murmur. I feel my wife’s pulse, dread
stillness. The incredible regular rhythm
is the rate
of our death, and blood brawls with
thought in my head.
The metal comb scrapes back and the
cat gyrates
to curse my wife as she culls out fleas.
A red
stain spreads on her nail: her sharp
remarks grate.

“Graham Kerr says
you should cook
with What ified
Butter?”
M
Clarified Butter. Pure dairy butter with the
water, salt and curd removed. Butter that
doesn't splutter and foam when it’s melted,
that won’t catch or burn. As Graham Kerr
says, “Clarified Butter brings out the flavour
of food better than anything else I know".
And, of course, you have to use so little
Clarified Butter—just enough to cover the
bottom of the pan lightly. And you use it at
temperatures much lower than those recom-
mended for other cooking fats and oils. So
protein fibres are cooked much more gently,
food comes to the table so much more
tender. Try this recipe using Clarified
Butter (also sold as Ghee or Butter Oil,
incidentally).
4 thin veal cutlets
seasoned flour
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon milk
dried breadcrumbs
1? ozs. clarified butter
4 thin slices lemon
2 hard boiled eggs, sliced
4 anchovy fillets
Method: Beat veal slices until thin.
Toss in seasoned flour, then dip in egg
and milk mixture. Dip in breadcrumbs
and press with a flat knife. Heat clarified
butter in a heavy pan. Fry the veal slowly
for 10 minutes, turning once. Serve
garnished with slices of lemon, egg and
anchovy fillets.
Yields 4 serves.
Clarified Butter may be purchased at all the
best food stores, If you have difficulty obtain-
ing it, or would like further information and
recipes, write to The Director, Dairy Foods
Services, Australian Dairy Produce Board,
406 Lonsdale Street, Melbourne 3000.

NATURE 8 FINEST
SOMETHING NEW WITH
Graham Kerr
DISH IT OUT IF
YOU DON'T LIKE
WHAT'S DISHED UP
THE WAITER carried the plate of
steaming kidney soup to the table.
“Your soup, sir,” he said, deferentially,
before lifting up the dish and bringing
it down sharply on the diner’s head.
Then, with unhurried poise, the waiter
walked to the restaurant foyer, removed
his gloves carefully, dropped them on
the maitre d’hotel’s desk, and resigned.
This happened in June, 1949, at a
very well-known London hotel.
The waiter had suffered badly at the
hands of a customer who not only dis-
liked the food but found needless fault
with everything else about the res-
taurant. Although the waiter’s action
was indefensible he was convicted of
assault there must be a legion of
waiters who, at one time or another,
would have dearly loved to have held
that plate of kidney soup.
To find out how we complain, and
how our complaints are received, I
rang 20 leading Sydney hotels and
restaurants. As might be expected, most
of them said they did not receive many
complaints. I wasn’t impressed by those
who said, “We never have a complaint.”
They must be either super-human,
incredibly conceited, or deliberately dis-
honest. Not worth bothering about. But
the honesty of the others made investi-
gation worth while.
My inquiries were concentrated upon
Mr. Johnny Walker, of the Angus Steak
Cave and the Bistro; Mr. Renzo
Romano, of Renzos, Rose Bay; Serge,
the maitre d’hotel at the Chevron Hotel;
and Mr. Woolfi Pizem, of The Coach-
men, Redfern. All of them admitted
that they did receive complaints from
time to time and considered them most
valuable. And they all had identical
methods of placation. They relied upon
their own personalities to draw out any
displeasure felt by guests. Only The
Coachmen chooses to put this delicate
matter into print. The menu says: “It
is the desire of the innkeepers that all
who participate and enjoy our good
food and wine, tell all others. If your
evening is not to the standard of our
well-known reputation, then please tell
V.S.”
Is it actually necessary should
restaurants go out of their way to
almost incite a customer to complain?
Any self-respecting advertising man
would say it is a mistake —that it intro-
duces a negative. He would be right
in the case of a salable manufactured
product, but dead wrong about
restaurant complaints, in my opinion. I
can quote a famous example:
The restaurant Veeraswamy’s, in
Swallow Lane, London, has a neat,
beautifully printed card, complete with
an envelope addressed to the managing
director, inviting customers to assist the
management by offering advice as to
how they may improve the food,
service, and comfort.
This seems to me like a good idea.
Good, because a host should never risk
embarrassing his guests by “complaining
to the management” in front of them.
He can quietly ask a waiter to remove
cold food, a tough steak, or corked
wine, but it is difficult to become
involved in a major debate with the
manager or owner.
I think that the manager would also
do well to bear this point in mind. If
he is genuine in caring about his guests’
pleasure, then he should avoid, at all
costs, a drawn-out discussion. The
restaurateurs I talked to agreed fully
on this point. If any guest complains,
their immediate action is to make no
charge. They then offer an alternative.
This is usually rather difficult. If the
error involves the main dish, there is
a longish wait until it can be cooked.
By the time it arrives, the other mem-
bers of the party have finished. So,
naturally, the offer is seldom accepted.
In this event, there is simply no
charge, except in the case of Renzo
Romano and Woolfi Pizem. Renzo
offers a. “special” coffee (Irish) with
liqueur or a half bottle of imported
champagne. Woolfi Pizem has deliber-
ately introduced “special” and “exotic”
desserts to serve as a peace offering.
When I ran a restaurant in England,
we kept a special dish Braised Ayles-
bury Duckling with Wild Cherries
on hand, just in case. This was immedi-
ately available for a replacement and
was served in a beautiful antique-silver
covered dish.
The experience of Sydney restaurants
is that the average Australian diner
complains least of all not, it is be-
lieved, out of consideration but because
of lack of confidence in his or her
ability to criticise. But there are excep-
tions, of course.
“Young Australian men are prone
to send wine back to impress their
girlfriends,” I was told. “Usually only
10 percent of the rejections are justi-
fied, but we never argue. The wine
is recorked and served as wine by the
glass.” The other exception—thank-
fully a rare one among Australians
—is the “shouter.” The loud-voiced
angry customer is usually found at the
end of the meal, often more than
slightly intoxicated and quite impos-
sible to silence. Due to lack of con-
fidence, he has been building his com-
plaint up and up during the meal, until
his temper finally explodes. No matter
how justified his resentment is, he can-
not expect either consideration or
respect. But even he deserves some small
credit compared with the vast percent-
age of Australian diners. The totally
gutless, totally destructive, and most
feared foe of all restaurateurs is the
customer who “puts up with it,” pays
his bill, leaves without a word, and then
spends months bleating his miserable
head off about the food, wine, and
service at so-and-so’s restaurant. This
is the type of man who richly deserves
a faceful of rich, smooth kidney soup!


Letters
Army officers
“Ex-Officer” is correct when he says
(8., May 18) an unusually high pro-
portion of Army officers are Catholics,
when compared with the rest of the
population. However, I feel that the
reasons he gives for this are not valid.
The two he mentions, family security
and absence of religious prejudice,
would scarcely enter the heads of most
17- or 18-year-olds who apply for entry
to Duntroon.
I suggest that the main reason is the
large number of strong cadet units in
the Catholic schools throughout Aus-
tralia, together with the fact that a boy
who has gained his education in the
stricter atmosphere of one of these
schools is more likely to be amenable
to a disciplined military life.
A further reason, which should' not
be overlooked, is that many boys from
these schools who are anxious to receive
tertiary education find that their par-
ents cannot afford it, either because
they have large families or because of
the cost of secondary education for
them. Duntroon offers tertiary educa-
tion free of cost.

Aboriginal stockmen
I have come to regard “Agrisearch” as
an interesting, stimulating section of
your weekly. I was very disappointed
therefore to read in this column (8.,
May 25) of the attitude of the writer
to Aborigines. Pastoralists may well
react to equal pay for Aborigines by
putting off stockmen, but the statement
“progress is usually bought by the sac-
rifices of some people” the implica-
tion being that Aborigines will just
have to go without jobs to put more
money in the pockets of the pastoralists
approaches racism. Let us not forget
that the Aborigines have been sacrificed
for the white man’s progress for nearly
200 years. The statement “as they are
much less intricate to build ... it
might be possible to employ displaced
Aboriginal stockmen in their construc-
tion” is a patronising racist statement
that can only be taken as a direct insult
by the whole of the Aboriginal people,
and should appal any rational person.

Roo farming
The tasty dish “Kangaroo Stroganoff”
devised by a certain Sydney caterer (8.,
June 1) and pronounced “very tasty,
indeed” by the Minister for Lands, Mr.
Lewis, may be just another nail in the
coffin of the kangaroo. Is it possible
that this dish will find acceptance in
spite of the warnings contained in a
report in the Medical Journal of
Australia, October, 1964? Quote: “Dur-
ing the period 1960-64, an unusual
number of salmonella were isolated
from human sources, with increasing
frequency, in the Salmonella Reference
Laboratory, at Adelaide. There is little
doubt that kangaroo meat, sold as a
pet food, constitutes a serious danger
to public health, if the observed degree
of contamination with salmonella is
allowed to continue.”
If, through the publicity given the
new dish, it becomes legal to serve it,
then soon every “hash-house” will
feature it on its menu. The poor old
roo is surely used for almost every
conceivable item that can be made
from him. Running shoes, football
boots, toilet-seat covers, mats, golf-bags,
even his head has been mounted and
offered for sale.
Mrs. Margaret Wright,
Brighton, Vic.
The Downing Plan
Your commentator (8., May 18) rightly
suggests that a full-scale inquiry into
the pension problem is imperative.
Professor R. I. Downing, author of
the “Downing Plan,” now admits that
the saving of money cannot provide
for retirement, since money saved loses
its value by “inflation,” yet, strangely
enough, he thinks this will not occur
under his new plan, also based on
money contributions.
One must indeed be naive to believe,
under this plan, that the $l2OO million
yearly to be extracted from employers
and employees, besides more taxation
as the Government’s share, will not
affect prices. Certainly industry will
not pay away from $BOO million, as its
“levy,” without loading this “cost”
into its prices, and assuredly the $4OO
million employees would be forced to
contribute will spur them on to demand
wage increases, and further taxation
would encourage both moves.
All this plainly adds up to more
“inflation,” higher prices, and thus we
get the price-spiralling that has crippled
all other superannuation schemes.
Bigger and bigger contributions, as pro-
posed, would not overcome this, but
would make the spiral go still higher.
An inquiry into this matter there
must be. But let us, above all, see it in
its proper perspective. It is basically
one of determining whether our eco-
nomic system can provide the things
retired folk actually need; that is,
clothes, foodstuffs, and amenities.
Therefore, the question must be: can
industry, primary and secondary, pro-
duce the extra bread, butter, meat,
shoes, shirts, and housing, etc., that a
higher pension distribution would de-
mand? The answer, undoubtedly, is:
yes, on good authority, it can be said
that many Australian industries, and
particularly those producing consumer
goods, are now working at 25 percent
below capacity. They would surely wel-
come a bigger consumer demand.
Here, then, is the key to the problem.
But, obviously, the money needed to
draw upon this idle capacity must
come from a source other than existing
incomes, because when that happens it
merely transfers existing demand.
The Reserve Bank of Australia, under
its charter from the Federal Parlia-
ment, is directed and empowered to
create and issue money for the “welfare
of the Australian people.” And if the
provision of money by this bank, and
its use in drawing upon current unused
industrial capacity for this purpose, is
not justified in these circumstances,
then the words quoted have no sense
or meaning. Until, in fact, the monetary
system is made to reflect the proven
potential output of goods from indus-
try, all the tinkering about with con-
tributory superannuation schemes will
avail nothing but disillusionment and
despair.

Koestler contested
“What’s wrong with us?” is a damn
good question; it is essential to the
scientific diagnosis of the malady of
any body. In three of the most impor-
tant spheres of activity business, poli-
tics, religion - business is the only one
using this vital technique.
Politics avoid any such aid because
it would expose the aimless, unimagina-
tive muddlers who, as things are, can
get away with almost anything, thank
you very much. Religion, of course,
playing “Onward Christian Soldiers” in
reverse, and singing lustily, “We shall
not be moved,” in a ready-mixed-con-
crete sort of way, stands firm (or
flounders) on the Rock of Ages.
In these circumstances, when Arthur
Koestler “ventures a new diagnosis of
the human predicament,” what gives?
Very little gives—or is given. Koestler
gets a bit warm when he says: don’t
be surprised if we find “some con-
struction fault in the circuitry that we
carry inside our skulls.” Introducing
Prof. Mac Lean’s “schizophysiology,” he
cites our behaviour as “dominated by a
relatively crude and primitive system,
by archaic structures in the brain.”
Rot. There’s nothing wrong with the
system or the structures; we’re only
using two percent of our brain’s capa-
city. This is simply because we have
been conditioned to being shoved into
educational and other grooves, especi-
ally religious, and to accepting arbitrary
conventions to such an extent that we
have been blocked from discovering
that the brain has the vital functions of
probing and development both in-
ward and outward in what consti-
tutes man’s spiritual nature. There is no
constructional defect here only crass
ignorance, prejudice, bigotry, and sup-
pression of the truth that’s “what’s
wrong with us.”
