Io Poean!
It is a time for all lovers of honour and honesty,
for all haters of cant, hypocrisy, and humbug, for
all free men and white men, and good men and
true, to make a joyful noise together, to sing and
toshoufc, to take each others’ hands, and say, “Let
us go up to the temple or down to the pub. and
render thanks or drink good luck over a great
deliverance.”

Jubilate! We are free. We have shaken the
grave-clothes from ns ; we have kicked aside the
shrouds; we have broken open the coffin, and
escaped from the sepulchre. We look down on
the charnel-house. Faugh! how it stinks.

There lies Sir Henry Pabkes, K.C.M.G.,
—a political hulk. As huge and pitiful
a hulk as the Wagga Wock, or the
Kiams Ghost, or the dragon beneath the
trampling hoof of the war steed of young St.
George. Bared and exposed, and condemned.
Measured and weighed, and found wanting. The
eyes that scan him are sick of discovery.
There, mark him ! The man who six
months ago, robed in Australia’s strength and
youth and greatness, let his own bad manners and
ridiculous vanity leak through, and made ua a
laughing-stock in all the Courts of Europe. The
man who, returning, added contempt to insol-
ence, and impudence to chicanery; who flung
his political reputation and miserable self-asser-
tion as a gauntlet in the teeth of five thousand
electors, and said “ I will represent you, you
shall not escape me,” —he creeps out like a disrated
kitohenman, and goes skulking, cap in hand, to
the meanest suburb and the outermost electorate
of all the colony, to endeavour by some means to
get back to the purgatory of Parliament, if not
to the paradise of the Executive Council Chambers.
Life in the outer world, life amongst men unsoiled
by politics and unprovided with the chances of
political life, would be simply intolerable to him.
It mattered little to the public what other elec-
torates did; the battle in which the nation’s
honour was involved was fought at East Sydney.
There, for the first time for many years, the man-
hood of the country asserted itself ; there, for the
first time, the horrid, nauseous, indigestible mess
was felt as some poisonous mess in the national
stomach ; there it was thrown out upon the face
of the earth, in the eyes of the world.

An old proverb tells us of the dog returning to
his vomit. That proverb will be applied to, and
will be merited by, New South Wales, if after the
pronouncement of Thursday last, her neck is ever
again placed beneath the heel of iha man Pabkes
and his servile following.
« « •
And following the rejection of Parkes came
another victory. Only a little victory—as the
choking of a grub after the slaying of a tiger, as
the cleansing of a Sydney Town Hall to
the labours of Hercules in the Augean stables.
It was the killing of John Davies. John
Davies went to South Sydney with a bland
face and a clammy hand, with a reputation
armed against all public attack by a pending
Supreme Court action, with back-door promises
of all kinds for every terrace in the electorate—
with all his Good Templar badges and all
his Orange ribands; he was dressed in broad-
cloth and fine linen —as sleek and pious and comely
a sinner as ever wore a Holy Roman token or
bamboozled the “ horny-handed.” But the eyes ot
those electors had been opened and they had seen,
and their ears had been unfastened and they had
heard; and, most important of all, their noses
had been prepared and they had smelt; and thus
the blue ribbons of Good Templarism, and the
yellow cords of bigotry, and the oil, and the
gammon, and the underground engineering and
the fanning could no more draw John Davies
back to Parliament than a skein of silk could
lead John M'Elhone to ask pardon for his sins
at the feet of Henry Parkes.
* * •
And, as day follows day, and report after report
comes to hand, we learn than the country has
shaken off the rotten garments in almost every
electorate. We feel that the question has been
put: “ Are you with these men or against them —
are you for the old regime*or the new ? “ Under
which king ? Benzonian —speak or die ?”
• • •
But, whence has the great change arisen, where
had the new impulse birth ? Is it but puny spleen
against the old man who has served the State so
long—but an impulse of rage evoked by a foolish
and contemptuous arrogance which the frank-
nsss of senility makes too palpable and gross P
Is the State suffering from but a paroxysm
of hatred, _ or is it the outburst of long-
pent-up indignation against a system which
has oppressed, a policy which has defrauded, an
arrogance which has insulted, a clique that has
degraded us Is it this poor, silver-haired old man.
Parkes, against whom we set our battle in array ?
this jackal, John Davies, against whom the
manhood of the nation goes up to the ballot-box
to fight and to win ? When our campaign is over,
will it be but the arbitrary closing of seme leoture-
room doors, or the hypocrisy that desecrates,
while affecting to preserve, the decency of the
Sabbath, that will be avenged? Will it be but
some wretched story about Coonanbara hats or
Eandwick tram-tickets or diamond rings that has
moved us ? The meanest man who went with a
hard face and a determined hand to the ballot-box
knows better. We have not gone to war against
shadows—we have not raised clubs against pig-
mies ! The man Parkes stands—yes, stands, for
Tenterfield has lent him a rotten crutch —stands
as the head and chief, as the living soul, in fact,
of a Government, gaudy with sham, slimy with
cant—that has dared to parade in the face
of the world as the essence of all truth and
honesty — as the wise and tender guardian
of a nation strong with all the vigour but
weak with all the untrained impulses of
youth—a Government that has put the rich cloak
of enterprise about a miserable spendthrift body,
that has oared not one jot whether the morrow
should bo bankrupt so that to-day was filled full
with gold and ease—a Government that day by day
was selling, giving, forcing the territory of the
people upon strangers and foreigners, sojourners
for a day, then absentees, with only a fang in
Australia and a hungry mouth and greedy gorge
in another land to devour Australian substance,
• • *
Henry Paekes stood as the arrogant head of
this Government. His creature Davies did the
“undergound engineering.” The one was the
bullock dressed in lion’s hide, the other the jackal
covered with the wool of the dead sheep. Both
are now lin their political coffins, thanks to the
honest electors of East and South Sydney, and the
epitaph graven by the hands of New South Wales
will be—“ They’re dead, without successors.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Bishop Moorhouse on Bazaars.
We cherish a feeling towards Bishop Mooehouse which
might best be described as affectionate awe. Though
he is one of the champions of the church-militant in
Australia, the rust of his armour has not yet eaten into
Jiis soul. But, while chivalrous, he is occasionally
'illogical. This, of course, is only when logic and
dogma won’t agree. At such times his priestly training
overcomes his strong common-sense, and ho lays him-
self open to the irreverent criticism of the ungodly,
who, we are sorry to say, have no more regard for a
bishop than for the average pawn. Here is a case in
point. A litile while ago his Lordship denounced race
sweeps as immoral, but described bazaar raffles (church
bazaar raffles, you know) to be such square affairs as
to be almost sacred. Mark this episcopal casuistry:
“In bazaar raffles, a number of persons combine to-
gether to purchase an article—there is nothing wrong
in that. Having subscribed enough money to purchase
it, they next proceed to determine by lot which shall
enjoy the possession of that article, and this is a mode
of deciding quite in accordance with Script-je prece-
dent, as witness the case of Matthias. ( We don’t see,
by the way, why the case of the casting of lots by the
Roman soldiers for the Saviour’s seamless garment
should not get an equal show with this as a Scripture
precedent; but, of course, we ai e only heathens, and
don’t know much, about these things, anyhow). . . .
In racing sweeps and other ventures recognised as
gambling, the man who risks hi!j money expects to win
yours, and vice versa, without auyl hing being given in re-
turn; whereas, in a bazaar raffia everyowner of atieket
holds a beneficial interest in their common property,
which is actually purchased. As everyone cannot be
the possessor of the article, it is necessary to deter-
mine who shall take it, and there is no fairer way of
deciding' than, by casting lots.” Charmingly clear!
And yet we are sinful enough to doubt, even after this
delightful demonstration. See how the thing looks put
in this way: “In church bazaar raffles a number of
persons buy a certain article. Good. This article is
generally a china dog, or a Scriptural picture iu
wool-work, in which the Apostles are repre.
sented with yellow eyes and purple beards, or
something equally useless. Each person puts
down a sum of money—generally twice the value
of the article if bought right out —towards the pur-
chase of this. After all whom bright eyes and mes.
meric smiles can influence have been inveigled into
the sale, the article is declared purchased, and
the lottery begins. This isn’t gambling—isn’t it ?
Now turn to the other side of the shield. In a
wicked race-sweep, a man puts down so much money
—say £1. There are so many prizes in the sweep,
equalling in amount, when taken altogether, the
amount of money put in, less the promoters’ discount,
which is clearly stated in advance. Say there are
ten thousand people in the sweep, who each invest £1.
Each of them then has a ten-thousandth share in the
whole of the prizes, which are “ actually purchased.”
But —the Bishop's words iu regard to Church raffles
will fit in here exactly—as everyone cannot be the
possessor of the article, it is necessary to determine
who skall take it, and there is no fairer way of deciding
than by easting lots. Precisely. It is just a lottery as
to who shall get the ticket which entitles to a prize.
And that prize is money, which is useful—not China
dogs and Poonah-painted cushions, which may be very
pretty articles of vertu, but are not of much account
when the bailiff comes in and the furniture is sold off.
Besides, money won in raee-sweeps can always be given
to the Church. So that wo must this time respectfully
differ from Bishop Moorhouse with reference to his
dictum regarding Eace-sweeps and Church-sweeps. The
principle involved in both is essentially the same. And,
again, this holy equivocation is just a straight evasion
of the Gambling Act. Some time ago, a blue-eyed
young lady, with a smile like a seraph and bangs like a
cherub, would trip up to seme helpless male creature,
and, catching him by the coat-tails with her dainty
hand, ask him to take a “ chance ” in the lottery for the
Chinese dog. Now, she asVs him to take a ‘‘share.”
As when he agrees to her wish—which he will, if he is
not a savage—he is, according to the Bishop, the part
possessor of the prize. We would like to know just
what part of the dog belongs to him. Your Lordship,
we reverently but firmly submit, this is too thin.
Veneerial Virtue and Venereal Vice.
We are quite tired of the Rev. Mr. Kirby and the
other vessels of virtue who surround him. Day after
day we have read columns ef rubbish about this jenny-
jessamy theory of theirs of restraining the social evil by
moral suasion. Moral suasion! What does this moral
suasion mean, anyhow ? If it means anything, it means
that we are to hush up the unpleasant rumour that wo
have a skeleton in the cupboard,to smooth over with
fine speeches the grisly fact that there is a corpse in
cellar. Pah! not all the nard and cassia in the East
will kill the smell. If we are to deal with this ques-
tion at all, we must not shrink from dealing with it
exactly as it is. There is no use in talking of it in a far-
off impersonal sort of way. Drag off this disguise of
mock-modesty in which you have draped it, and 1st us
see the thing in in its native nakedness. It will not,
probably, be a very pretty spectacle, but we are not
looking for pretty spectacles just now. We are going
to dissect the corpse simply. First, then, here is an
extract from an English paper. It describes the condi.
tion of things in the holy city of Edinburgh, where, if
anywhere, moral suasion should be irresistible “ Mr
Henry Varley, having expressed his amazement at
the social evil which abounds in the Scotch capital,
correspondents of the Edinburgh Daily Review are
vying with each other in describing what they term
‘ the terrible condition of Edinburgh.’ One of them-
who has made a tour of inspection in the slums,
vouches for the fact that * Edinburgh is steeped in the
most frightful disease, having an outward religiousness,
but corrupt and hollow to the core. Not in Dahomey, nor
in the most degraded spots in heathendom, can you
exceed the fearful depravity that wallows in some c£
the closes and pends within a bowshot of the Modera-
tor’s chair of the General Assembly of the Free Church.
In Edinburgh there are scenes worse in degradation
than can bo seen in the worst abodes o horrid
cruelty in the most degraded places of heathenism.’ ”
The statements contained in this paragraph fit in
exactly with what David Buchanan saw a little while
ago, and if David Buchanan and Yaeley both say a
thing, it must indeed be true. Now, of what use, think
you, reverend gentlemen, would moral suasion be in
these filthy dens? Of what use can you imagine it
would be in corresponding places in our own city ? Do

yon think a woman, the grave of whose wrecked repu-
tation has been “ sown with hate and seeded down to
scorn,’’ is going to he influenced by your pious plati-
tudes ? If she were, could you assure her that the past
would bo forgotten and forgiven, and that she would be
taken hack to the place she had fallen from in society,
ttnd the fatted calf killed in honour of her return ?
Gentlemen, you are either wondrously ignorant of the
■Ways oi the world or you are not. Wa prefer, for our
own reasons, to think yon are not. Anyhow, we can’t
Conceive how you can believe that any woman with a
spark of sensitiveness remaining would give np a life of
debauchery to come back to decency in order merely to
he treated as a pariah and spat upon—metaphorically,
of course—every hour in the day by those whose virtue
might pessibly consist of lack of opportunity for vice.
And that she could come back into society on any other
basis is—excuse onr profanity—infernally impossible.
As it is, you say, if she have any material for reclama-
tion in her, she is at times sick almost unto death of
the society around her. Very likely, but then none of
them can spit upon her for her strange crimes, for
crime is familiar to them all. They are a sorrowful and
sin-stained sisterhood, but they have at least sympathy
for each other. And again you say “ moral suasion,”
and point to the agitations of respectable women
against this “ vile law ’’ which regulates vice of
this kind by force, and is a standing dishonour
and danger to their sex. And again we say. Bah!
Do you mean to tell us these women petition against
this act because it has inj ured other really respectable
women ? The linstances where it has so done are
miraculously rare, and placed side by side with the good
It has done, are not worth a moment’s consideration.
But you say they are working in the cause of their
erring sisters. They wouldn’t have these sisters further
degraded. Noble charity. And yet these very women,
very probably, let those erring sisters of theirs go to
damnation every day without raising a hand to stop
them. They would consider the hem of their skirts
defiled if it touched their erring sisters in the street.
"Why don’t they use their virtuous energies in keeping
their sisters who are erring every day out of the gutter
and the hagnio f We are sick of the subject. If yon
don’t know anything about it, reverend gentlemen, why
do yon talk about it P If you do—we are ashamed of
you. The thing exists, has existed and will exist, and
must be dealt with as a stark fact. If you wish to deal
with it you must roll up your sleeves and not fool about
•with perfumed gloves on your hands. But we think
you will agree with us, after you have sufficiently
advertised yourself by agitation, that you had better
leave it to the State.
Bank-account Baronets.
God in these days is spelt with a small g, banker with
a big B, by some people. We are not some of them, but
many in Australia are, and so, we regret to say, are
numbers in England. What else does this baronetcy
given to Mr. W. J. Clarke mean ? Has he done any
great action to deserve it, has he saved his country at
any time, has he made a splendid reputation as a states-
man, or has he got this title on the old, old, cash-down
racket ? If mere money be admitted to have any claim
to ennoblement, then, we think, Mr. W. J. Clarke is
the best representative of mere money that could be
selected. But we don’t think it has any such claim,
and further, we consider that this act has opened a
loophole through which all kinds of abuses may creep
into our already not too' pure social system. If the
fact of La via# money is to make a man eligible for
ennoblement, then we can point out a dozen men —a
dozen public men, mind yon—who will finish the damn-
ing of their souls in orlier to get together the amount
required. What a splendid epoch is at hand for land
iAiarks and swindling contractors 1 And what sort of a
high old time will the clerks of the College of Heralds
have while they are vamping up cant crests for these
shoddy seigneurs, these multy magnificoes I It is
rather hard, however, considering the circumstances,
that the ancestors of these people can’t be ennobled at
the same time as they themselves are. For instance, it
would be a hit rough when a new baronet is
entertaining some of his noble friends in London, if,
when he asks his old and trusty colonial henchman to
come out and amuse their lordships, that venerable
person should spit on his hands, and instead of starting
with, “Yes, Sir Jacob, that was as nearly as I can
remember in old Sir John’s time —your father, Sir
William, and one of the finest gentlemen that ever
breathed”—he should begin, “You bet; that was in
old Jack’s time—your old man —and the meanest old
that ever lived.” After all, this worship of wealth
is just an apotheosis of meanness, for in nine cases out
of ten somebody in the family of the parvenu peer, if
not he himself, has been mean and miserly, and, per-
haps, a rogue, or this money would not have been
accumulated. Why not ennoble meanness at once?
The wealth is certain to come afterwards 1 If this
method were adopted, we know a number of men in this
city whose claims to patents of nobility could not be
overlooked. There is, for instance —however, we
think we’ll stop here.
A person styling himself “ Professor " Gilbert, who
lectures on subjects which, when treated by persons of
his standing in the realms of science, are too apt to
become simply obscene, the other day brought a specu-
lativo libel action against the Maryborough Chronicle,
which had the pluck to expose the true character of his
discourses. The jury very properly returned a verdict
for the defendant newspaper—which now finds itself
unable to recover the costs (£300) incurred by it in
fighting a man who went to law having everything to
gain and little or nothing to lose. As
the libel laws of Queensland and New South
Wales stand, any penniless adventurer may drag a
newspaper into the Courts, intending, should he
win, to exact his pound of flesh; and, should he lose,
to become bankrupt. Worse still, any blackmailing
pauper who gets a verdict has the privilege, not only
of making the journalist insolvent, bat of putting him
into gaol for an almost indefinite period. Even deten-
tion in the debtors’ prison for a year or so doesn’t efface
the unfortunate newspaper man's liability. The libel
law of this colony has produced a generation of
wretchedly weak-kneed newspapers, and scores of bare-
faced plunderers of the public. The law is all in favour
of thieves. It corrupts Courts some of which are
already corrupt, the Senate, and the Corporation, for
it stifles the public voice. It was introduced here by
men who, if not themselves ex-felons, were tyrants and
bullies and murderers, and had lived all their lives in
an atmosphere of crime. It was worthy of its authors.
It is worthy of the men who have maintained it, and
prostituted it, and stretched it until it nearly broke,
and the public cried out against it and aided its victims.
It has long been abolished in England, for it belonged
to the days when a hungry man who stole bread was
strangled by the hangman. It no longer exists in Vic-
toria, the people of which colony have shown ns the
way in every species of reform. The present lioel law
of N.S.W. will last just so long as tainted blood main-
tains its influence, a*d men whose fathers wore leg-
irons control the current of what in this colony is
mockingly called “right." However, if we win n
case, we’ll get our eosts or something equal to them.
"Fight" is inscribed in blood-red letters on our
banner.
Some time ago, in reply to a question, Mr. F. B -
Suttor solemnly declared that no favour was ever
shown to anyone in the disposal of Government billets,
but all went by merit solely. We were right glad to
hear this at the time, and it made us feel cool and easy,
because we were told that two cousins of a certain
Minister had been appointed to the lucrative and re-
sponsible semi-professional billets in the Service with-
out producing proof that they knew any more
about their work than a pademelon doos about
the Thirty-Nine Articles. We were also delighted
to learn from Messrs. Lucas and Lackey that their
relations were a credit to any country, bnt what made
us fairly lie over on onr backs and kick for joy was the
fact that, as soon as ever Mr. Windeyer was elevated
to ths Bench, a Minister at once allowed his son-in.
law to be hoisted from the humble position of C.P.S.
in a country town, to the exalted one of Deputy Sheriff
of Sydney. It is said that some of the old officers in this
department are getting quite bald through s« many
youngsters being put over their heads, but It’s all
done now—at least for the present. Oh, and the
other day a man eame into onr office and told ns this
little tale : —Borne time ago two men were gent to gaol
for a month for stealing a bottle of spirits from a city
publio-honse. A certain estimable politician was
amongst tke magistrates who adjudicated in the case,
and took part in the decision. This politician, our in-
formant states, gave one ef the two thieves a “ lift ” at
the expiration of his sentence. First, the ex-prisoner
was found driving a cart for a certain Government
department. We have only given the skeleton of
this episode. When Parliament re-assembles, we’ll ask
seme member to tell the balance of the story.
The scoundrel, Adams, who, by getting the unfortunate
Longhubst falsely convicted (at Wellington, N.Z.) of
rape, had him put into gaol, loaded with irons, and
scored by the lash, has escaped justice by sheltering
himself behind his daughter. He was eonvicted
of conspiracy on fair and square evidence, and
has saved himself by a legal quibble. The point was
reserved that his daughter was of too tender years to
be (legally) capable of conspiracy. Ergo, as it takes
two to make a conspiracy, Adams pere was not a (legal)
conspirator. Three learned N.Z. judges have quashed
his just conviction on this point alone I Common sense
revolts at such a judicial crime. The question wasn’t
whether Miss Adams was old enough to conspire with
her father. It was surely sufficient that he wert
through the form of a conspiracy with her. However,
let ns hope that Adams will he convicted at least of
perjury, or something. In America, if such a scoundr si
escaped, he'd be lynched from the nearest upright good
enough for a gallows. Longhurst is still in gaol 1 And
this is British law 1
WOMAN ITEMS.
The champion zealot is the Episcopalian clergy-
man who, hearing recently that one of his flock was
about to marry a Wesleyan young lady, wrote a severe
letter tolling him such a marriage would be displeasing
to God, and would entail “ a wretched fall ” We don’t
know whether this is always the case with young men
who marry Wesleyan girls, but we have noticed this—
that they generally have thundering large families.
A young man has just called at our office with
his knees so badly bruised and lacerated that he could
hardly walk up the marble steps. It happened to him
through dancing with an old maid who was so poor, and
thin, and tough, that he got used up terribly in the
fracas. We were sorry to see him, fer his case will be
used as an argument by those dull people who cry down
the modern waltz. There is no doubt that if
many such sad oases come to light, the close-oommun-
ing waltz would have to be abolished. But then the
abuse of anything is no argument against its use. That
yonng man didn’t take ordinary precautions. The
usual young man does not danoe with females who are
in the least petrified; and if forced to do so sometimes,
he should compel them to wear pads. There is no case
on reeord whore a young man has been bruised up by
dancing with a young girl ©f the period. These young
girls aie not that kind of hair-pin at all—at least, so
we’re told. It the young men can’t dance with angu-
lar old maids without being maimed, then the old maids
must bo done up with cotton wadding. Bat we’re not
going to have the modern waltz pat down. No, lieu-
tenant.
Josh. Pickersgill, having been in ’Frisco, tells
what he saw and knows of the society girls there.
They’re death on paint, and the great proportion on
the block have their cheeks daubed, eyebrows colored,
false front hair, and tiny cnrls gummed to the face;
and the whole business, as a rale, badly done. Even
those who have good complexions do it, because it is
the fashion. Then, next to the face, be notices the
foot. He seems to have noticed this a good deal, for
he says “ no pen can do justice to the feminine foot of
’Frisco. He made special inquiries about these beauti-
ful feet, but they (the inquiries) were bootless; the
foot peeped bcwitchingly at him from tram steps, and
set him crazy at crossings, bnt no explanation conld he
get as to how all the ladies came to have such “ elo-
quent little extremities.’* The boot does it, no doubt,
as in Franco. Josh further observed that American
women dress well, though in sc mo oases they help
nature with a new hip, or “ an indiarnbber heaving
bosom,’’ which articles are freely displayed in the
ordinary shop winiows. Bnt it’s not advisable to look
at them; they’re ruinous to pure sentiment.
A young lady, who resides at Lake Preston,
Dakota, has lately created quite a furore among the
eligible yonng men of the neighbourhood by an adver-
tisement in the local paper. She says: “I mean busi-
ness. If there is any yonng man in this county that
has as much sand in him as a pound of ping tobacco,
I want to hear from him. I have a tree claim an©
homestead, am a good cook, and not afraid of work, and
willing to do my part. If any man with a like amount
of land, and decent face aad carcase, wants a good
wife, I can fill the bill.”
The battle of the divided skirt is waged vigor-
ously mJLondon. Lady Harbecton, its most influential
advocate, has worn the skirt on every possible fashion-
able occasion daring the season. She possesses a tall
symmetrical figure, has a graceful carriage, and, though
invariably attracting much notice, is quite self-pos-
sessed under the gaze of wondering eyes. Newspapers
have attacked the skirt on the score both of ugliness
and inconvenience, and have said that one disadvantage
is the inability of the wearer to hold it np, except in a
olumsy, sailor-like hitch with both bands. Bat this is
an unfair objeotioa, for the dual skirt is supposed to be
out sufficiently short to escape the ground even in
sloppy pi ices, and never needs raising.
The “ Social Science Sisterhood” of ’Frisco is
a society which has for its objeot the liberation of
woman from the •* tyranny of man." Its soul is a Mrs
Stowe —a large, aggressive-looking blonde, with steel-
bine eyes and a jaw like a prize-fighter. She presides
at the meetings of the sisterhood. Her hair is out
short and bound np with a blue ribbon. At a recent
conference she wore a black velvet eoat-tailed bisque
and a short-plaited black silk skirt. Her limbs below
this were concealed by black oasumere trousers, cever-
ng the ankle. Her gaiters were of cloth, and on her
breast she bore a red silk badge, stamped “ 8 S.8.”
(the initials of the society’s name), fastened with a
diamond pin, and two artificial rosea. She also carried
a fan, whieh was used with a coquetry somewhat florid.
In the cour-e of her lecture she explained that she had
doable flannel undergarments, but she never wore
corsets—had never worn them in her life. She is not
afraid to say that horrid word “ trousers.” It is her
belief that trousers were first worn by women, bnt
that men soon usurped the privilege. She argued that
the word " trousers ’’ was derived from trousse, to
dress; and “pantaloon” from pantule, to cover the
heel. Man’s heel, she said, being less handsome than
a woman’s, ho soon saw the advantage of trousers for
every.day wear, and so assumed the garment. When
Peter Campbell gets free ones more, he ought to visit
California and coalesce with Amazon Stowe. The
combined show would be a big boom.

A St. Louis girl who angles for effect always
carries her background with her in her parasol, thus
bringing ont her charms to perfection. A large parasol
lined with shrimp pink is “immense” behind a
pretty brunette; and a Nile green heightens the effect
of a blonde At balls in America now, when the
M.C introduces a young man, he asks him whether he
wishes a “dancing girl,” or a “porch girl.” The
latter, dear reader, would be a “ corridor girl ” in our
Town Hall, or a “stroll on the beach yonng girl” at
Botany. The latter is always chosen It is known
in Paris that several wealthy Frenchmen keep harems.
An extraordinary joke at a wedding breakfast was
perpetrated. Jnst before the guests eame, a large
oentrepieos was removed from the table, and in its
place a live hedgehog was placed and covered with
flowers. He had been dipped in ice-water to make him
roll np tight and be quiet. When he unrolled, scattered
the flowers and went for the guests, there was jnst the
aontest horror among the bridesmaids they ever felt up
to date People only send wedding presents now at
the last moment, in case the match should be broken
off, as so often happens. They’re an awkward element
in such cases American brides now take their chief
bridesmaid on the wedding tour. The experience the
bridesmaid gains on such an occasion is both interest-
ing and useful....An auctioneer, before a sale, remarked
to a friend about a liqueur-stand that it was worth
£5, bnt he supposed tome fool of a woman would give
tern for it. He found it ©n his side table at home,
ticketed at £12 An American’s rich wife insisted on
having all her dress boxes six feet long, so that her
dresses could go in without bending them Lady
Monckton is accorded the distinction of being the best
amateur actress in England At high-toned English
weddings, long lists of the wedding presents are sent
to the papers. It is an open question whether the
bride does this te make other girls wild, or to punish
those who don’t give enough. For instance, it’s very
annoying to see, after some magnificent suite of
jewellery given by some one else, your own name an-
nounced thus: “Mr. Smith, a cribbage-board," or
“ paper-knife." Shakespeare makes four of his most
lovely and lovable women—Viols, Rosalind, Portia, and
Imogen—assume men’s garments, without losing their
womanliness of character. But Shakespeare’s women,
even in a man’s doublet and hose, never exhibited go
mnoh undisguised figure as several well-known “blook-
ists" do in Gaorge-street, any fine afternoon Ladies
will have to be careful of their stockings, as the famous
Balbriggan has been burned. Thousands of hot e were
destroyed, and all efforts to subdue the flames were
fruitless We’ve known it almost impossible to subdue
the flame raised by only one pair of cotton hose.......
Madame Adam’s fashionable farm, near Paris, is th >

THEGREAT
ONE OP THE WORLD’S GREATEST
OARSMEN.
IN a recent oonversatioa in Kingston, Canada, with
a representative of one of the foremost journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Trickett, the celebrated
oarsman, who is at present open to row any man in the
world, gave the following as his opinion.
I have found St. JACOB'S OIL a sure and certain
cure, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains in back, brought on by ovor-ex.
ration in rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sure
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without further trouble.’*
The writer listened attentively to the above. It was
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who knew what ho was talking about; and now he says
that St. JACOB’S OIL and good sthletio training, ar
what all our young men want.

HAVING carried out our intention of publishing
the contents of our NEW BOOK in weekly
parts, and the same having been well and favourably
received, we think we cannot do better than repeat the
lists already in print. Before we do so, however, we
feel obliged in common fairness to ourselves to add the
following few lines: —The success that has attended
the publication of our Little Book, the ECONOMICAL
HOUSE FURNISHING GUIDE has caused unprin-
oipled persons to copy it, actually to copy our lists
word for word, but making the totals (no doubt as a
catch penny) a few shillings less. Former attempts
were made to allure our customers in the following
mannerBring us Campbell Brothers’ Book and we
will do this and that for you. This mode proving un.
successful, a copy of our book must have been taken to
a Printer and an order given for so many with instruc-
tions to follow this. Now can there be anything
meaner or more contemptible? Competition, true
competition, we court, is the soul of business, but a
thing of this kind is despicable. If people must follow
in our wake, why do they not put before the public
something original ? something of their own composi-
tion ? Cue Book is well-known as the ECONOMICAL
House Furnishing Guide. It is popular and well
recommended. Its circulation has reached thousands.
The word Economical was specially chosen for it, and
we think no one can deny it is used in its true sense.
List No. 1 shows how to furnish for £15,
List No. 2 shows how to furnish for £25,
List No. 3 shows how to furnish for £35,
List No. 4 shows how to furnish for £50,
List No. 5 shows how to furnish for £70,
List No. 6 shows how to furnish for £100,
List No. 7 shows how to furnish tor £2C0,
List No. 8 shows how to furnish for £300,
These are all examples of good value. If it were
necessary or at all desirable, we could reduce our lists
in shillings and in pounds, still keeping the same nuns-
ber ol articles in each, but there would be no advantage
to the buyer in this. We must remember there is such
a thing as False Economy. To be truly economical
one must be prudent in expenditure.

the following, especially at Christmas time, but we
must begin at the beginning, and therefore take the

We would rather at this time have said something
about our GREAT CHRISTMAS BAZAAR, but we
■hall doubtless have other opportunities tor doing so,
and will content ourselves with merely mentioning the
fact that we are holding in our large Upstairs Show
room a GREAT CHRISTMAS SALE or BAZAAR.
Reader.— Doubtless you will add in something to the
beauties and comforts of Home this Christmas Season,
and in so doing, aim at purchasing such things as will
best correspond with the furniture and home embellish,
ments yon already possess.
For this purpose we specially and respectfully invite
your early attendance at our Showrooms.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
It is said that a beautiful widow will share the
honours of Sir Beauchamp Seymour as Baron Alcester.
Mr. Anthony Trollope is again seriously ill. He
is suffering from Bright’s disease and cannot recover.
Sir Saul Samuel will be delighted to hear
that there is a railway station standing on the spot
where he had his last brush with the blacks.
When John Davies entered “ public life” he
became an alderman and a member of Parliament
within the same week. Now he’s been snuffed out
within a week.
The reason such a big slice of it is to be sold is
that he became a friend of the Prince of Wales’ friends
at Hurlingham and thereabouts. Dropped thousands,
and now has to pay up.
There are expectations at no distant date of two
additions to our by no means small Royal Family. The
Duchess of Connaught and the Duchess of Albany are
both in that condition in which ladies who love their
lords delight to be.
The proprietor of the London Daily Tele-
graph, Mr. Lawson, is about to join the Church of
England. There will, therefore, be nothing Jewish left
about him but his “ponum" now. This somehow
reminds ns of our very own . He, however, only
changed by a fluke —“ the hazard of the dye.”
“Atlas” has been reading the “ Soldier’s Pocket-
Book,” by Sir Garnet Wolseley, and gathers from its
perusal that, should he take his seat in the House of
Lords before his £50,000 has been voted him, ha will
himself oppose it, for he says “ the only rewards that
are justly our due are the gratitude of our country and
the praise of our superiors.”
E. B. Sanger has just made a delicate calcula-
tion, and finds that, including Western Australia and
all Northern Territory above a direct line drawn east
and west from Rockhampton to the Sonth Australian
boundary, the forcible and elegant old Saxon word,
"bloody,” Is uttered in Australia 685,606 times per
minute, equal to 11,406.6 per second.
When Marshal M'Mahon was President of the
French Republic, he was shown by the painter D(Staille
a picture in which fourteen Prussians were held as
prisoners. "Yes," said the Marshal, contemplating
the picture thoughtfully, “ those are the prisoners we
took in the war—all of them ! You are patriotic, if not
discreet. You shall have the Legion of Honour.” And
he got it.
New Mayor of Adelaide is Mr. Fuller, manager
of Hill and Co. (the local Cobb and Co.), and ax-partner
of (and sufferer by) the over-memorable Ebby Ward, of
Para Wurlie. Fuller is considered one of the shrewdest
business men in Adelaide, yet Ebby did as he pleased
with him. Of course, Fuller’s countenance gave con-
fidence to other knowing oysters, who were duly
opened.
The Prince of Wales and the Duke of IjJdin-
hnrgh will scarcely dare to vote again for the “ Bui to
Legalise Marriage with a Deceassd Wife’s Sister.” The
Bishop of Lincoln has solemnly appealed to them, and
to the House of Lords, " to set an example ef the main-
tenance of the laws of the Church of Ragland, es-
pecially in regard to the tables of affinity and mar-
riage.”
Curiously enough, the 21st December, the day
appointed for the return of the writs of election, is the
anniversary of the Parkes-Eobertson Ministry. The
coalition occurred 21st December. Sir Henry who, as
is well known, believes in ghosts, probably believes in
omens also. The 21st December, 1879, was a lucky
day—for Sir Henry. The 21st December, 1822, will be
a Ineky day—for this colony.
The other day Mddle. Feyghine, the lover of the
young Due de Moray, shot herself at Paris, in the pre-
sence of that nobleman. Gossip has nearly tired itself
out over the Dnc and hia affairs, but one interesting
fact has been reserved till the end by way of a sensa-
tional finale. M. de Momy, then, is possessed of a
basin and ewer, soap-dishes, foot-bath—in short, of the
complete fittings of a waahhand-stand, the whole of
which are made of solid silver 1
At a water suburb, recently, some ladies gave
a party, and about midnight a well-known pedestrian
becoming sleepy, some lively young ladies, assisted by
gentlemen, clipped off the alumberer’s moustache. He
took it quietly when he awoke, but two of the young
men who assisted as barbers have since had their per-
sonal appearance altered, and have been going about in
a badly dilapidated condition. So all parties are now
satisfied.
It is palpably plain that either M’Elhone or
Thady O'Kane edits Blackwood’s Magazine now, as
the mildest terms applied to the “grand old man,”
Mr. Gladstone, are—“grand old libeller, unscrupulous
old antagonist, unmitigated fraud, bitter and m alicions
old reviler,” &o., and he is furthermore cheered along
by being told his sin has found him out, and speedy
retribution waits for the pleasure of an early interview.
Mr. Gladstone is the miniature Sir ’Enry Parkes of a
small place called England.
Baron Wilhelm Rothschild, of Frankfort, who
has £237,509 a tear, is a strict Jew, and always travels
with his cook, butcher, and ten devout Israelites to
pray with him. That’s how ha spends his money. He
is always either eating or praying. He can’t pray alone,
for it takes ten to make up a Jewish congregation,
whereas with us only “two or three” require “to he
gathered together.” We have asked all our friends to
gather together and have a go in, but they don’t seem
to roll up somehow. Perhaps they will, though, when
we have £237,500 a year.
The composer of a certain very celebrated Eng-
lish opera —we won’t mention names, for reasons—has
left a lot of sons all more or less legitimate. The
trouble seems to be that there are several mothers.
Two different sons of different mothers have lately
written to the Editor of the Fioaho each claiming to be
the only legitimate son of the late composer. Both agree
on one point: that is that their mothers are destitute,
and that they trust the public, etc. There is always
some confusion when a man dies before he has got time
to properly sample out his family. The least the author
could have done in life, would have been to call the
roll every Monday morning.
Some men have no reverence, like we have, for
wealth. The Count de Jui*n6 (we’d like to hear the
Franoo-Dubbo Edm man’s pronunciation of this name 1)
who is a great Parisian sportsman and breeder of
horses, recently held a large sale ef yearlings at Dangu,
and on live of the best ones being knocked down to one
bidder, a friend enquired of the Count the name of the
purchaser. Going up to the auctioneer, M. de Juigne
made enquiries, and on returning to his friend said—
•* C’est un changeur de la rue Lafltta; un nommt?
Rothschild ”—a money-broker of the Rue Lafltte,
named Rothschild. Fancy any one epkeaking like that
of Sir J. W. Clarke (Bart.) or. Sir Beaconsfleld Wilson.
The Prince of Wales —that intrepid P.M.—haa
been having a good old time at Hamburg. He has been
trying to lose flesh, and taking baths daily composed of
pine extract, Mannheim salt, iron filings, sarsaparilla,
and, we suppose, water. At Hamburg, H.R.H. made
the acquaintance of Miss Cbamberlaine, an American
young lady, whom he established as a beauty. Miss C.
used to be invited to join the Prince’s lawn tennis
daily. This was very agreeable to the feelings of Miss
Cbamberlaine—very much so—
But when the dad heard that the Prince
His daughter favour forced on.
He took heriear and made her wince.
And lugged her back to Boston.
Oscar Wilde was born some years ago. At the
early age of four months, his Ma came upon him one
day sucking a lily, and saying, “ Pretty, pretty which
convinced her that his tastes were pure. She fed him
on cake and candy, and he had sunflowers as playthings.
Now he has developed into the most aesthetically
tender and incredibly virtuous young man on earth.
He is as intense as he is ungainly, and haa contracted
the fatal vice of writing verses. He travels for the
purpose of enlightening the world about the hidden
meaning of the horse-shoe in art, and to tell why lilies
grow limp. He knows why a goose stands on one leg,
an Esthete on two, a fire-dog on three, and a saw-horse
on four. He brings mankind face to faee with the
utmost, the far-off, the unattainable, and the dim.
Wind him up and let him pose I
B. Russell Daunt, the holy thief who broke
bail, the other day, and cleared out, has, it appears,
swindled numberless people in Sydney this time. A
case has been brought under onr notice in which the
pious scoundrel sold £600 worth of Barmodman United I
shares entrusted to him by a young fellow who had
invested all his savings in the claim. Daunt disposed
of the shares in August last and embezzled the pro-
ceeds ; but continued, up to the 12th October, to inform
hia unfortunate client by letter that the mine was
11 getting on nicely," and that there’d " shortly be a
dividend," and so on. The escape of this hypocritical
ruffian is altogether attributable to the laxity of the
officials in what is farcically termed the Department of
“ Justice.” Daunt is supposed to have cleared to
America, and it’s the duty of the police department to
follow him to the other end of the earth.
Mr. Cortis, the champion bicyclist, has ar-
rived. He has a genial physiognomy and a nose
of the Duke of Wellington type. His appearance on
the whole is long, lank, and attenuated. He is mnoh
longer ene way than the other, and considerably
narrower each way than both. Fat is conspicuous by
its utter absence, as there is not sufficient of that
matter in hia entire composition to furnish material
for a farthing candle. He is long in every detail; ho is
long in the arms, long in the legs, and long in the feet.
His optics, more especially the left one, are inclined to
be hawkish: whilst his auricular appendages are of
about the same length, breadth, and depth of those
which other mortals have been furnished with by a
beneficent Providence. Taking a cursory glance at
the doctor from the front, one might mistake him for a
note of exclamation turned upside down; whilst, from
a side view, it would be difficult to see him at all, and a
two-foot genial smile completes him.
As we discovered the champion mean man last
week, so have we dug out the champion crawler this.
One of Lord Rosebery’s grooms got killed by a fall
from his horse, and His Lordship was one of the wit-
nesses at the “ crowner’s quest.’* Lord R., it must be
remembered, is the lucky boy who married Madelle. de
Rothschild, and who, in consequence, is worth a good
many shillings and half crowns and things. He is like-
wise a great friend, and a profound admirer of Mr.
Gladstone. Such a big swell as this wasn’t to be
treated lightly. So the Coroner thought, anyhow |for
the following scene took place : —The Coroner: —“ will
you be sworn. Lord Rosebery ?’’ Lord Rosebery: “Cer-
tainly I wilL" The Coroner; “ I thought perhaps you
would give yo«r word of honour 1” His Lordship was
then sworn in the usual way. Can anything be more
edifying than this ? We wonder whether it would be
death to kick a Coroner. If not, it would be a remark,
ably pleasant thing we should say to boot that Epsom
man.
There haa been, it is now certain, a terrible
burst up of the Land League, and O’Donovan Rossa, Pre-
sident of the Dynamite School, is accused of “ annex,
ing” the sugar. We knew a little of O’Donovan R.
when he had a steamship and railroad agency on Broad,
way, N. Y., nearly opposite the (old) N. Y. Herald
office. He used to lie in wait for “ Mickey ” there, and
persuade him to send for his friends. Lots of friends
Mickey used to send for had been dead long ago; but
O’Donovan had a list as long as one of Dowie’s sermons
(and as lucid), so he managed to convince hundreds
who could neither read nor write, to pay the passages
of relatives who had long been beyond thinking of any-
thing but who should get the paper first down in the
family vault. At that time Stephens the Fenian head-
centre was living in New York too —at the Metropolitan;
—and was a kind and considerate patron of the ballet.
Rossa has now a nitro-glycerine newspaper. He will
have lots of things before ho dies. Perhaps he’ll even
have an entirely new line then. Qiti sail t
The Duke de Morny, for whom Mdlle. Feyghine
shot herself, was known as “the ladylike duke,”
because he was so effeminate ; and how snoh a spirited
girl came to be victimised by such a worthless fop is a
romantic story. She was one in a million for character,
aa well as beauty. Born of a drunken peasant father,
with three uncouth, wild brothers, she had from her
earliest years to buffet for herself; she was resolute
and reliant, and never felt the want of a strong arm to
lean on. Judging from her own kin, she unconsciously
oame to associate manliness with ideas of brutal rough-
ness, and hence the fascination which De Morny exer-
cised over her. He was dainty and dapper, bejewelled,
soft of speech, exquisitely refined; ho was a “gentle
joy ” to her, and it was her Paradise even to be in his
presence. Hers was no ordinary love. She was truth-
ful and proud, devoid of finesse, and so far from trying
to eat up the fortune of the young duke, it was misery
to her to incur a debt for him to pay. It was, in fact,
her excess of gratitude and love towards himself that
bored him. Had she been less grateful, he could less
easily have cast her eff. His only object was to derive
the temporary gratification of having a more splendid
beauty than his friends could boast. That gained, he
tried to shake her off, and launch her among his
“ order ’’ as a professional beauty. The suggestion of
this was believed to be one of the chief causes that
drove Julie de Feyghine to suicide. Anyhow, that’s
the story from one point of view.
A portrait of Cetewayo haa been painted for
the Queen and placed in the long Gallery at Windsor,
to keep company with other “ pictures representing the
principal events of her Majesty’s reign, commencing
with her first Council.” These paintings, it may be
remarked, have long been a standing joke amongst the
dilletante. All the great pictures, such as “ The first
Cabinet Council,” and others, have been painted to
order for portraits, and as inferior artists have, for the
most part, filled in the red ceats and epaulettes, the
bodies are, in most oases, such as to painfully exercise
the originals of the heads. Thus, in one painting, the
Duke of Wellington has been fitted with Lord Clyde’s
legs, while Sir Henry Havelock’s head surmounts Lord
Raglan’s tunic, and the trousers of the Earl of Cardigan.
The Empress Eugenie is very indignant about the paint-
ing of Cetewayo, and also about his cordial reception;
and there is a rumonr that she has “taken her
chaneys ” out of Queen Victoria’s yard in consequence.
Cetewayo is stated to have been, this reminds us, the
best behaved King that ever visited London. When
driving in the Ladies’ Mile, he was never seen to ex-
change significant glances with auricomus angels in
mysterious broughams, and, when invited by Kimberley
to go to the theatre, he sent back declining on the plea
that he could see quite enough naked women in his own
country.
Jealousy has been the trouble at Wilcannia.
It’s the old thing—a pretty girl carrying on with two of
them at once. John Dickenson fell in love with her at
an ontstatien on Mena Murtie run, and in the course of
courtship he gave her many valuable presents, including
a watch and chain, a fine suite of jewellery, and £5
in cash. This was a mistake from the first; but ho was
unsophisticated—he didn't know that to hold a woman’s
affection with presents is about as feasible as carrying
water in a bottomless bucket. Of course, she married
the ether chap. The other was Joe Carswell, a gay
groom at the neighbouring hotel. The evidence showed
that she had been engaged to Dickenson for eleven
months, and he still considered her so up to the day
she married; yet she took all his presents, especially
the five pounds, and coolly stated afterwards that she
never had any thoughts of marrying him. When John,
a few miles off, heard he had been fooled, he saddled his
moke, loaded a revolver, and in a high state of fueling
went for the perfidious Mary Ann. It seems probable,
however, that John didn’t understand much more about
firearms that he did about females, for though he placed
the barrel against her rosy cheek, he only managed to
scorch its bloom a little. Then Joe appeared, and inter-
fered, and John cleared. John Dickenson was sentenced
to seven years’ meditation in a cell (and on a sell).
Pauvre diable. And as wo have often given girls presents
ourselves and been thrown over, we can only remark
we’re sorry that pretty Mrs. Carswell has not to spend
seven years in the next cell to him. Woman's a sweet
invention I
These gilded theatre saloons, "and champagne,
and pretty barmaids, and pretty persons who never
appear to have been maids of any description—those
are all very nice and fascinating and enjoyable, dear
boys, are they not ? There must be something con-
temptibly mean about home life and home people and
moral decency, and especially about such a thing aa a
lawful wife. It is ineffably grand to kick over the
paltry traces of conventionalism like a high-spirited
horse. Only there comes Nemesis after all! And
human organs and nerves don’t happen to be manu-
factured of cast-iron and tempered steel. A great
oversight, doubtless; but that is so. Now, it is a man
who was famons as the jolliest of jolly fellows —suc-
cessful in money-making as in everything else he
handled. Northern legends say he started as an ostler;

Here’s a fashionable item. At a recent meet-
ing of the Board of Guardians of the Sonth Stoneham
(near Southampton), Union, the master of the work-
house reported that “Lady Tichborne,” wife of “the
Claimant,” had, with two illegitimate children, become
an inmate, and he asked for the instructions of the
board in the matter. It seemed chat the woman, since
her husband's incarceration, has been resident in a dis-
trict ef the union called S. Deny’s.her chief, if not only,
means ef maintenance being an allowance from an
organised fund raised by certain of the Claimant’s
sympathisers. She was once summoned under the
Education Act for not sending the Claimant’s children
to school, bat these are now being properly educated at
two separate places in the country. Her “ ladyship "
had, however, since her husband’s conviction, givea
birth to two illegitimate children, and these being fol-
lowed by a third, comparatively recently, her bene-
factors withdrew their support, and she was compelled
to seek refuge with her two youngest children in the
union, quite destitute. She persisted i* giving her
name and title as “ Lady Tichborne,” and the clerk held
that the hoard were bound to register her in the parish
books as such. She informed the guardians, through
the master, that though declining to give any informa-
tion as to the paternity of the two illegitimate children,
she wishes to affiliate the third, and furnished the name
of the alleged father. The board ordered in-door
relief for her and her children, and desired her to
summon the man whose name she had given, in order
to obtain a magistrate’s order of support. By the way,
we read that a lady in Kent has written te the Guar-
dians of the South Stoneham Union, offering to adopt
“ Lady Tiohborne’s youngest child,” while a Yorkshire
publican has offered “her ladyship ” an engagement as
barmaid, which it is probable she will accept.
The French newspapers are publishing the
letter of Mr. Darwin to the German student, in which
he affirms that he believes neither in Divine Revelation
nor in future state of existence, and they are suggesting
that it is somewhat curious that, whilst the English
people refuse to allow a living “ freethinker ’’ (Mr.
Bradlaugh) to take his seat in Parliament, they raise
a monament in a Cathedral to one when he is dead 1
Patti, in a magnificent London theatre, the idol
of adoring thousands, the deity of song blazing amid
the world’s fashion, is very different from Patti in her
home in the weird Welsh hills. Her home is a place
of grand solitude—a day’s journey from the nearest
railway station. You leave the busy collieries behind,
you pass the mighty iron works, and from the hill side
see the last gleam from their great fires in the distance
like the mouth of a far-off Hades. The hills on either
side become higher and lovelier, and cottages are seen
no more. The hnge gashes in the mountain side speak
of the revel of storms ; you are leaving humankind and
entering a region of sterility and grandeur. The road
winds en in dreariness and utter seclusion, the moun-
tain in front seems to span the valley; and then, when
it seems yon can go no further, you make a sudden
turn round a hill, and Craig-ar-Noe bursts on your
startled view. There is the great Welsh castle, with
her tri-colour waving above; there is Patti’s home I In
the midst of sterility the Queen of Song has made a
beautiful retreat; there are terraced lands, lofty trees,
vineries, conservatories, and ponds. Inside, there is
all the furniture that luxury can devise or wealth buy,
therefore mahogany and malachite, marble and crystal,
Esthetic wall-papers, decorations of artists, and the
cleverest work of artisans. It is a splendid home; and
Patti is no recluse. Every collier, every old woman
knows her, and the children flush as she fondles their
red-tinted cheeks. There are good singers in the choirs
of the colliers’ chapels, and, recently, a band of them
made a pilgrimage to Graig-ar-Nos, and serenaded the
great ptima donna with one of Handel’s masterpieces.
And Patti entertained them like a princess, and sang
to them “ Home, Sweet Home."
When the Hona. Alec Hay and John Crozier, of
S A., were droving and shearing in the old days, it
happened they both worked for Dutton, at Anlaby.
Dutton would never pay his men till their accounts
mounted to £90. After going through the grind. Hay
got his cheque for that sum. So did Crozier. They
were mutually ignorant as to how the other man stood.
Hay determined to try for Adelaide, and set up a
grocery store. After getting his cheque he carefully
sewed it np in the lining of an old Glengarry, and left
Anlaby—on the tramp, of course. Ha made good pro-
gress the first day, camped at night, and had just boiled
a billy of tea, when footsteps crunched the dry bark
about, and Jack Crozier appeared. He had also
deserted Anlaby, and was also bound for Adelaide.
The men distrusted each other, for each knew little
about his friend. Alee thought that Jack had
obtained information regarding his £90 cheque, and
would rob him whenever practicable. Jack, who had
stumbled on his companion’s camp by mere accident,
oredited Alec with the same intention. Hence they
travelled together suspicious all day, and fearful and
wide-awake all night. They wore frightened to turn
their backs on each other, and used to sip their tea and
eat the damper as if every mouthful might be poisoned.
Jack, one evening, made Alec’s heart nearly leap out
into the fire by asking—“ How much money have you ?”
And Alee only added to Jack’s distrust by answering—
“ Just seeven or eight shillings, men, to buy a pannikin
o’ flour on the road." Thenceforward, Alec strove always
to walk behind Jack, while Jack was careful to carry
a gum-stick big enough for a vine-stake, and to swing it
carelessly round his head, like a quarter-staff, so as to
keep Alec at safe distance. It was a most uncomfort-
able journey, and very glad, indeed, were they when
the last weary mile had been trodden and the shanties
of Adelaide appeared in sight. " Mon,” said Alec, when
feeling completely secure, “ ye desdna knaw I carried
Dutton’s cheque for neenty poond sewed up here in ma
bonnet." And, as he spoke, he ripped up the lining and
produced the cheque triumphantly. “Now, did yon
know, old man, that I had a ninotyer on the South Aus-
tralian Banking Company—good as gold. Look here.”
So saying. Jack sliced off his breeches a patch on which
he had constantly sat, and displayed another Dutton’s
£90 cheque to Aloe’s astonished eyes. “ I thocht, men,
ye knew I had the cheque, and inteended to rob me."
“And I thought you ware going to try that game on
with me.” Then they laughed loudly and long, and
dissipated together, and spent a whole half-crown
between them. Dear, dear I how these sweet memories
oome like dim delightful dreams I Now, Alee and Jack
are the Honorable Alexander and the Honorable John,
and go fooling about with their wives in handsome
carriages, and lives in great houses, and draw their own
cheques, and dabble in politics, etcetera,

Signor Cagli of the Cagli and PaoH Opera Com-
pany bes with his usual —we suppose it is usual—
thoughtful generosity, sent us a Brisbane paper contain-
ing a long critique upon tha performance of the com-
pany np there. We are very glad to see that the critic
speaks well of them We should be much more pleased
if we placed any reliance upon tha judgment of Bris-
oane critics. This particular specimen has found out
that “Italian humour is like an onion run to seed ”
Perhaps it is, but oven then it is not half to seedy as
Brisbane humourists. However, wo have no doubt that
the Cagli and Paoli Company are all they are said to ba
and a good deal more. We can’t say more than this
until wa see them ourselves.
♦ * * *
If there is one flaw in the jewel of onr nature,
it is our good humour—our girlish tenderness in deal-
ing with the feelings of other people. This is more
especially the case when we have to censure the profes-
sion The editor of this journal, we mar remark, en
possant, is a gentleman of the most rigid veracity, and
resents any attempt of ours to hush up ugly facts or
Jot histrionic frauds down easily, as ferociously as
though wa had kicked his dog or stolen tho feeding-
bottle from his favourite baby. It is only by standing
over ns with a horse pistol against onr ear, that he makes
us write a par. that doesn’t biim over with the chalk of
human kindness. We draw the attention of the pro-
fession to this pleasing little trait of journalism, so
that they may not think too hardly of us when we write
anything that falls short of enthusiastic eulogy. We
would like to be a cracker motto, and say nothing but
nice things all the time if we could. A trifling consi-
deration of hash 1s all that stops us. It ia, therefore, a
splendid “ throw in ” for us to get a chance to criticise
snob an actor as Mr Sheridan, because we can speak
the straight truth without getting our own organism-
in which we take a casual interest —damaged, and with-
out hurting the feelings of other people—whom we are
interested in ail the time. Mr Sheridan then is a great
actor. We forget whether we ever said this before, but
then we are always forgetting. It is nice to forget at
times—at tbe end of quarters when the butcher’s bills
corns in and « o on. Personally, we think the death-
scene in “A Sew Way to Pay Old Debts,” which we
saw on Saturday night, was one of the finest tragic per-
formanoes we have ever seen on any stage in this
country. We say this with hesitating humility, because
a young lady, whose loveliness is only equalled by her
beauty, informed us not long ago, that we were on'y one
person, and mustn’t be led away by the hallucination
that we knew e' ary thing We were crushed at the
moment, but going home we framed a pretty speech to
the effect that knowing her was enough joy for one life-
time—but del senna di p oi ne son piene le fosse —the ditches
are full of clever after thoughts. We might mention
just here that since we began to devote some attention
to the cultivation of Signor Verdi’s acquaintance, we
have become adepts in Italian. We can now talk with
ease and fluency to any ordinary organ grinder who
knows English. But we must not be discursive. Let’s
see what were we talking of P John Davies, weren’t we ?
—no Bheridan —ah, of course 1
* * *
Well up till the very last act of Massinger’s
play, we thought Mr Sheridan had made a mistake in put-
ting it on, for a Saturday night piece anyhow. None of the
people we questioned that night—and w« questioned
everybody from Solomon in the front seats to ’Arry in
the gallery—bad ever beard of it before It is a wuful
thing that tho belles lettres should le so much neglected
in this country, that when one asks a man who Mas-
singer was ho should reply that he wasn’t sure, but
believed a man of that name used to keep a boot shop
on Brickflsld-hill. It takes the Herald criiicto tell
ns all about Massinger anyhow. He and Massinger
used to play together at school, and he used to steal
Massinger’s sandwiches. This is why the plays of the
latter are so lean-witted. Not so lean-witted either,
for although the humour is somewhat archaic, and the
characters are too thinly allegorical to be thoroughly
human, yet tin ro is an unconcealed villainy or virtue,
as the case may be, about them, that is refreshingly
novel in these days of shamefaced goodness and smooth-
faced crime. The moral of this is that Massinger is dead,
and Walter Keynolds lives.
• • •
Bevenons ! Mr. Sheridan’s acting in the final
scene of this play is, we consider, the best thing he has
ever drne, in Sydney, anyhow. It opens with a tornade
of triumph and closes with a paralysis of passion. The
climax where he ends his life like a grey old wolf
“biting hard among the dying hounds,” is terribly
realistic, and the expression of his face when he tries
to coax his daughter to come near him, and then
attempts to clutch her by the throat would have made
a fine study for Dor£ if that gifted artist were painting
a picture of the devil making a last clutch at the soul of
a Salvation Army man as it skipped into Heaven.
Certainly Mr. Sheridan is an actor of the grand school.
» # #
But people must have been particularly absurd
iu that age. If we had keen Sir Giles Overreach—by
the way did we say that Mr. Sheridan played this part ?
—we should, when onr “right honourable daughter”
had gone back on us, have simply run over to Paris or
to Pyrmont with somebody else’s daughter and reveTed
in ginger-beer and buns for the rest of our unnatural
lives. We are forgetting, however, that there was no
Paris to speak of and no Pyrmont whatever in those

Now we approach a tenderer theme. Pass us up
a nansy or a guelder or, if these are not handy, a
pa isaga will do. We would speak of the lovely Louisa.
In all parts in which we have seen her she looks charm-
ing—as Margaret she was simply s-'spbio. Touch the
harp gently, our pretty Louise I Let us try a trouba-
dour strain—
If w» were as Louise is,
And sweet Louise as we.
Why, that’s the thing would pleaso us.
If such a thing could he
Per, we would be an actress.
And she a scribe; each black tress
Of ours, tossed by the breez* s,
She’d smooth down lovingly
If we were as Louise is.
And sweet Louise as we.
If wishes were hot pies, and
The price of pies was high,
W »’d stay our bootless sighs, and
Start trade in the hot pie ;
We’d cut the Tribune office—
Where hunger’s hollow cough is.
And boys, to him who dies, hand
Ears living men won’t buy—
If wishes were hot pies, and
The price of pies was high.
We could write a lot more of this sort of thing, lu f . wa
are afraid if we were to go on that wa should off .md
somebody. We might even kill somebody, and if this
somebody happened to be such a man as (say) the gif tel
gorilla who writes “Upon the Flags," we should be
sorry, inasmuch as we would not like to have his friends
c namg round to thank us. But we must hurry along
Miss Davenport is a olever young ly.dy. whose grasp of
her art is growing firmer every day. Furthermore, she
is as yetplaetie, and may develop, with care and study,
and not too much reliance upon the infallibility of her
own judgment, into almost anything she pleases. If
she were to settle down into mannerism she would
never be were than a graceful actress, whereas if she
goes on improving as she has done, even since she was
here before, she may become a great one.

Perhaps John Lucas is the only man now living
who could have looked the character of Justice Greedy
better than Mr. Joyce did. You see this Justice Greedy
gets, as far as the comic element is concerned, nearly
all the “fat" of the play, and his humour Js accord-
ingly heavy. We wish Mr Lucas would play this part
just to oblige ns 1 Mr. Joyce’s performance, however,
is really first-class. Mr. Q. E. Ireland is also a thorough
gueoess as Wellborn. He has a certain command «f
facial expression, and knows how to carry himself upon
the stage, and when to carry himself off it. In fine, he
is a good actor. So is Mr. Cates, though he hadn’t a
leading part in this particular oast. So, also, is Mr.
Lachian M'Gowan, who played a damnable character
very detestably well. And this reminds ns that Mrs.
Marion Stammers, as Lady Allworth, acts better than
we have ever seen her act before. Mr. Patterson was
not a bad Lord Lovell, and the rest of the performers
were as good as ceuld be expected for the money.

A last word. Mr Sheridan is now (Thursday)
playing Biebard III. If thsn is anybody remaining in
this city whose soul is so dead that he doesn't care to
pay to see a splendid performance, then let him give his
money to Cribble's mission, and stay away from the
Gaiaty while Mr. Sheridan is there; but if, on the other
hand, there is anyone who does care, and hasn't got the
money, let him come round to us and we will lend it to
him. We can easily bo-row it from our washerwoman.
And, before we forget, Mr. Sheridan is going to play in
Newcastle during the Christmas fortnight We had
this under a vow of solemn secrecy from Mr. Sydney
Hall, his suave and sleepless agent.

There’s been an awful shindy at Murrnmburrah-
The Amateur Minstrels gave a show there, and some
“diabolical villain” mixed up some nitrate of silver
with the stuff they used for blacking up with. Now the
poor fellows are going about looking like e® many
chessboards, while tho perpetrator of the outrage has
not yet been discovered. One man was brought up and
discharged. The company intend, if they don’t get
better, to black up altogether, and go about giving
benefits to themselves. They are now called “The
Piebald Minstrels.”

Holloway is at the Ballarat Academy of Music.
One of his special attractions is a performance for
“ babies in arms.” Last season, when this “ draw” was
tried at the same place, the house was crammed. Next
morning the management discovered enough rag dolls
under the seats to fill an Orient liner. Other more
conscientious, though parentless, people borrowed
babies for the ocaasion, and did a bit of real mothering.
This time, however, William says he's not to be fooled,
Every child must squeal on entering.

From our Adelaide correspondent:—
Wybert Eeeve, would yon believe.
Has “ struck a patch " at last.
Wears costly jewels on his chain.
As also do his “ cast.”
The ladies of the company
Are blazing stars—of jewell’ry.
And now for journalistic “ jam ”
They do not care a Torrens dam.
One of the first things wa shall urge the new Govern-
ment to do will be to impose a duty on rhyme, and a
poll-tax on poets. A revenue sufficient to pay the ex-
penses of the usual man and bull-dog employed to
collecc bad debts wight be derived from the influx of
sons of song from Victoria and elsewhere. Of course
we don’t dream of alludmg here to Mr. D. W B X.,
and we forget how much more, Sladen. Th© Govern-
ment might also offer a reward for the scalp of tho
Tribune poet. Only we don’t care to jest about such a
venerable subject, wo would entreat tte man who had
the collection of this hoary chevelure to deal gently
with it and not spoil tho shape. A man can’t get a wig
every day to fit him, even though he have no brain-
buvaps to speak of. [This lets us out.—Ed. B ] The
“ Money Spinner ” has »ot belied its name, as far as
Mr. Beeve is concerned. It has, in a mild way, “ got ”
the people over here. Mr. Beeve gets out of himself
as Baron Croodle —there is more room outside, by
the way—makes up self-sacrilioingly, and only occa-
sionally reminds us of Fosco. Another remarkable thing;
he never palpably patronises his coadjutors on the stage.
Also, he only gazes up into the club-box recognisingly
about six times during the whole evening. A grateful
public bless him for this noble abnegation It must
have cost him many a pang, however, to give up his
sweeping moustache and “hoah” and ‘theah” which
he loves so much. Baron Croodle is the best comic
character wa have seen him play her© yet [We out out
here half a column of cxegetioal matter concerning the
growth and development of comedy from the da; a of
Aristophanes to tbose of Billy Wilson. Life may le
but an empty dream, but that's no reason why we should
make a nightmare of it.] Miss Alice Deorwyn as Milli-
oent la not much of a success. This is letting her down
gently. She cannot handle the gamut of passion and
emo ion so as to blot out the tawdry insufficiency of the
stage, and force us to forget every thing but the woes
and trials before us. That needs a larger experience,
a larger capacity, a larger nature than hers. And yet,
within certain limits, Miss Deorwyn can do good work.
We forget just now what those limits are, but we know
they exist. Mr. Emmett, as Lord Kengusae, impressed
the audience favourably. Miss Lena Ellis, as Dorinda,
seems to us out of her element. The rest you know all
about. Herbert Flemming, by the way, is improving as
a stage manager. That’s about all.

“ The Masootte ” at the Theatre Royal is
haviag quite a phenomenal run; —and there is a lot
about it which justifies the favour with which tbe
opera is nightly received. Miss Maggie Moore is as
amusing as ever, but her voice evidently want a rest.
We haven’t seen Mrs. W. in that carriage lately, much
to our disappointment. And this reminds us. We
said in a recent issue that her coachman had low
comedy “gaiteis,” but the cheerful comp, made it read
“garters ” Fancy talking about a coachman s garters!
Why, we never knew there were such things as garters
until we picked up a small knotted piece of tape last
Sunday at Manly, and inquired of an elderly lady who
presided over a ginger-beer stall, what it was. Ve hope
no harm has come to Mavgie’s coachman, and we dearly
hope the horses are in statu quo. We must confess we
received a shock on Brickfield Hill, the other day, on
seeing, dragging a waggonete placarded with “Vote
for Carter,” two horses which boro a remarkable resem-
blance to Mrs. Williamson’s. But they mightn’t have
been those self-same steeds. Brothers, perhaps, or
some near relations. We should be glad, by the way,
if Mrs. W. will let us know when she has quit# done
with her chariot. We will hire it directly. It might
save our having to build a new machine room.

Mr. Harwood is certainly very droll, bat Mr.
Kelly is very droll too, and he is not so ioag as Mr.
Harwood—which is a great thing. These two have all
sorts of the maddest gags. When, for instance, Kelly,
as the Chamberlain, announces “the Saltarella Troupe
of acrobats and dancers,” and is about to usher th*:m
in, Harwood says—“ Oh, very good—le*; the Saltcellar
Troupe come in ; ’ and a moment later Kelly announces
“ the Sarsaparilla Troupe,” which gets a great laugh
But funny as all this is, you get a little too much of it;
and this|remiads us that the leader of the “ Sarsaparilla
Troupe" might be replaced with advantage, since she
can’t speak even the two or three words that are set
down for her, and the “ Sarsaparilla” saraband which
she, in company with three other skinny young
ladies, executes, is the sickest Terpsichorean exercise
we have seen since the young ladies in satin snow-shoes
shuffled through a corpse quadrille in last year’s pan-
tomime, at the Eoyal Morgue. Mr. Woodfield appears
to fee getting smaller and more beautifully less. A
couple of months’ singing in concerts is the only thing
that can pull him round.
* * * *
The pantomime is being pushed along. H. H.
Vincent—the redoubtable Eamirez—is to be stage
manager, and Docy Stewart and old Dick come over to
play iu the piece. Docy, by-the-way, has never per-
formed in Sydney. Hie made her first appearance in
Sydney in the year [We can’t allow this Ed. B ] Maggie
Knight is a stranger too, we believe, fche is exceed-
ingly clever —her Polly Eccles being one of tbe best
performances we have seen since Marie Wilton’s. She
will not, however, play Polly Eccles in the pantomime.
The piece will, we think, be found very amusing. Wo
will give the name and other particu.ara next week.

“The Red Stocking Minstrels” have gone to
Newcastle, where, we sincerely hope, Mr. Hyman will
not fall a victim to popular fury when be goes on the
corner. Theresa and Jennie Horan are with him, but
they leave for Melbourne next Monday to play in the
Pantomime. This is better, on tbe whole, than singing
“ Peter dreamt of pumpkin pie,” or “ Tilly’s got a
trump and halo," at tho Victoria Hall, to three gas-
fitters, a butcher boy, and all the unemployed members
of the “perfesh" who can’t “get in" at any other
place. And this may run on into tho intelligence that
we ihave received a scrawl from D’Orsay Ogden,
who is at Gympio with Dearin, Lawson, and Sayers
(whom some people are idiotic enough to term “ Eng-
land’s greatest Comic Singer.") We wish when D’Orsay
next addresses as he would charter the boots bo sharpen
his olothes-prop.

Poor old Leake’s Mozzle’s out again ! He has
been playing “ My Partner ” np at Tam worth, with
Howard and Simmons’s crowd, to wretched business.
They struck the town at election-time, and the result is
what might have been anticipated. The last piece they
played was “ The Three Musketeers,” a drama, it seems,
in 17 acts. Tho occupant of the stalls on the first night
brought a bag of tucker and a bottle of hair-dye. He
said he didn’t want to give his family a shook by return-
ing a greybeard —And, now, listen. Lily Marsh has
written a crushing letter to the Gunnbdah Advertiser
ve statement that appeared about her having “ slithered”
without “parting” in the Nasioi Independent. She
says : —“ ... To justify myself to my many friends in
Gannedah, Tamworth, Armldale, Glen Innes, Inverell,
Grafton, and the other towns I have visited ia the dis-
trict, permit me to say the article in question is a tissue
of malicious falsehoods. . . , As regards the libels
and malice displayed, I leave that to be settled hereafter.
Touts truly, Lilt Marsh Narrabri, Nov. 25th, 1882.”
Miss Marsh is evidently a lady that is not to be trifled
with. The Namoi Independent must be a very wicked
paper to say those cruel things about such a nice little
thing as Lily. There is evidently a misunderstanding
somewhere Lily, however, isn’t inclined to quarrel
with the Free*. Adn why not say now that Maccabe
opened in Dunedin on the 9th instant, and that Martin
Simsonsen’s little lot are only doing so so with
“ Bocoacio ? ” Maccullum’s star is still ia the ascend-
ant, but his crowd don’t succeed so well in “ Patience ’’
as in “ Tambour Major.” “ Billaa Taylor ” has n.-.ver
proved a draw anywhere. A bad Custom-house officer
hit hiocardi in the nose in Christchurch, and Biccardi
had him fined a fiver. The next “ hit" to this on record
is P.anquette s new opera “ Bip Van Winkle,” at the
London Comedy Theatre. The success, however, i f
“ Bip" is not anticipated to be so brilliant as that of
“Les Cloches de Corneville." From Planqueite to
Penriih is a natural tnnsltion. Well, Bidge's Circus
is there—we mean, at Penrith. This is the best show
trarellingon earth and Bernado the clown andtheintelli-
gent mule are the wonder of all that see them. There
used to ba a performing bear at the circus, but when it
saw a memb.r of the troupe drink colonial beer it died,
broken-hearted with envy.

Clara Stephenson drew a crowded house quite
unexpectedly in N.Q. the other day. It was a pouring
wet night, and the hall was crammed. The printer, it
seems, had billed her as “ T he Lady of Loyns ” Clara,
at latest dates, was at the Towers, playing what Thady
calls “ The ehaughraion ’’ Helen Vivian has evidently
struck a soft spot iu the old man’s heart, for she gets
some of tho “ real jam ” that Arthur, her hub., ia so
fond of singing about. W ith a dart to London, now,
we have it that the Laureate’s new play is to be called
“ The Promise of May," and will be in prose. It is to
be produced at the Globe by Mrs Bernard Beere, a very
clever and talented manageress, for whom the Duke of
Sutherland is said to entertain a platonic regard Very
handsome is Mrs. Beere —but it is now some time since
we have seen her porter-ate.

We think we have before mentioned that the
Weekly Shroud makes —or promised to make-
dramatic criticism a special feature. And so they have
up to this —a special funereal feature. Last week the
Shroud contained the following “ It may be possible
to give an idea soon about the pantomime that will
follow the greatest theatrical hit of tha year. In the
meantime, to quote Mr. Woodflrla’s (sic) trite remark,
the publio will have to be content with * banking their
fires, and going slow.’ " Of course, Mr. Woodfield says
nothing of the sort; the expression being a gag per-
sietently used by Harwood 1 Another amusing item
in our lugubrious contemporary was that Fred. Mervin
(the Tambour-Major) was resting his voice in London,
and had declined any amount of solicitations to appear
in comedy I This is very funny. Fred. Mervin in
comedy on the London stage would be worth about as
much a week as the genius who makes a special feature
of dramatic criticism for the Shroud. Everybody was

Touch tho trombone tenderly—
We would sing of Emelie,
Ever fair and ever young
Hebe, that herself has sung
Sweeter than all singers may.
For she sings in such a way.
But life is short, and we can’t go on gouging out
rhymes like these for ever. We think we shall give np
verse-writing altogether, anyway. We find that ever
sines we took to it, people .begin to look at us as sus-
picions oharac' ers- Which reminds us that we saw the
dramatic critic of ths Tribune in the Opera House the
other night. He was using one of his ears as a punkah
at the time, and did not see ns. And, by the way, this
suggests to us that we observed a wood-cut in last week’s
Town and Country, thinly labelled “ Fijian Fighters
from the Hills," but which everybody knew represented
th© Tribune humourists taken in a group. Eheu 1 Let
us go on. Miss Melville is certainly a wonderful little
lidy. We believe, without the (lightest exaggeration,
that she is growing younger in appearance every day.
We saw her years ago, ard we saw her last night; and,
if we had to choose between the two performances, we
ehould choose the latter. She has gained in chic, since
then, for one thing. As Periohole, she is just perfect.
And how does she “ fetch ’’ the audience ia the song
sbe sings when she is “ a little tight ’’ 1 Every sentence
sticks Tike a spear-point, every accent pierces like an
assegai into your short-ribs; and you can’t help chuck-
ling aloud like a maniac. At least, we couldn’t; but,
then, we are not particularly sane at any time. Tbe
chansonette she sings when being presented to the Vice-
roy is somethingto hear. We wish Miss Melville would
stay with us for ever.

Harding, the tenor, ia improving wonderfully,
but Sims E-eaves has still got a slight lead of him. As
Piquillo, Mr. Harding is picturesque, but not pretty.
However, we think that, as he gains confidence and
knows whore to put his hands, he will sing much better.
As it is, ho is not by any means a bad Piquillo. Mr.
Farley makes a very fine Viceroy of Peru, and Casselli
“makes up" a certainly comical Count de Panatellaj*
We believe we thought the others were pretty good last
night, but wo forget. We are sure, however, of the
Misses St. Glair who are charming. By onr sweet-
heart’s eyes we swear I

And now, in solemn earnest. We consider that,
taken altogether, this performance of “Perichole” is
the very best we have had in this city for—well, for a
good many years, anyhow. The choruses ate dashingly
delivered, the dresses are beautiful, and the scenery is
splendid. Farther, every member of the company acts
and sings at his or her best. And that best is good.
We like to see artists performing in this spirit at any
time, and wa like it all the better where the interests
of such a sweet little woman as Emelie is at stake.

The Cagli crowd have made a “ hit,”
At least so it appears.

In friendship, notin years.

luck.

A few of the whilom Clark and Ryman
warblers have turned up at Penrith. They .call their

tbe way and go via Dnbbo.
Hobart we hear — the bows is fresh—

And among the rest wo know there
Jennie Lee is playing “ Jo ” there.

In the crowd is Emma Fischer

H. W. Chapman will eloonte at the Protestant

the people come out.

As may have been seen by ads. elsewhere,
Walter Eeynolds and Bayless have had a row. A lob
of people teem to have a row with Bayless, somehow.
That is the fault of the wicked world—for L.M.'s veins
flow with the cream of human kindness. We once had
a little difference with L.M. ourselves, but when we
found he was praying for us at early dawn daily, wa
made it up. We trust Walter will de likewise. Thera

Amongst the names of the sufferers by the
latest Melbourne railway smash, we notice that of
G. E. Johnson, architect, Yarra-street, Hawthorn.
We believe we are right in stating that G. B. J. was
the architect commissioned to design Allison’s pro-
posed new theatre. Mr. Johnson also designed the
theatre recently opened in Hobart. His injuries are
described as being “ fracture of jaw and concussion
of spine." He was in Sydney only last week, and as
he is one of the best known architects iu Australia,
Victoria will, no doubt, have to pay a big bill on hia
account.

Frank Towers produces a pantomime at
Christmas, which is to be of rather a spicy sort. Wa
will give the title later. Frank is now casting about
for a symmetrical crowd; and whenever he meats a
likely-looking young person in tho street, ho stops and
asks her if she’d like to adopt the stage as a profession.
Mis last attempt was on Tuesday. He encountered an
attractive party near the Bathurst column, end tupping
her on the shoulder, whispered—"Come and ba
histrionic.” “Sir,” she replied, ‘ I belong to tha
Salvation Harmy.” Frank then coughed uneasily, and
slid, or rather slunk, into Oliffe’s.
Mr. R. H. D. White.
On our first page this week we give a portrait of
Mr. R. H. D. White, one of the candidates for
the Gloucester electorate. It is unnecessary aC
the present moment to refer at any length to the
career of Mr. White. He is an Australian, and
was born in that quaint old township, Stroud, in
the heart of the Gloucester electorate. Mr.
White’s experience has been wholly Australian,
and few men have exhibited a more genuine public
spirit in whatever part of the colony he has been
located. The demonstrations at his departure
from Mudgee attest his usefulness and popularity
with the miner, the selector, and the grazier. The
mining community of the Western districts
accepted Mr. White as their champion, and no
man, in a private capacity, did more financially
and politically for that section of the people.
Mr. White who is one of the wealthiest men iu
this country, is liberal in his views, and with tho
vast majority of the people of New South Wales,
condemns the general policy of the late Govern-
ment, and notably their patchwork land legisla-
tion. Mr. White’s election for Gloucester ought
to be a certainty, if it expects capable and
independent representation in Parliament.
Mr. L. F. Heydon.
On page 8 appears a portrait of Mr. L. F. Heydon,
candidate for Yass Plains. We don’t agree with
"Lou. Heydon” in his fiscal views; but he is
right on the Land question, and is a thorough-
going Liberal. “ Lou.” has all the running in
him, and is not played out. He is plucky ard
resolute. Yass Plains has always been wall repre-
sented in Parliament. If it does not desire to be
practically disenfranchised, “ Lou.” will agaia
represent the smart little constituency of the
South.
At last the country has got something from Sir

PEPPER AND SALT.
Says the Bum : “ The result of the elections, so
far, was not only unexpected, but has come as a sur-
prise upon the public.” Yes; "unexpected,” and "a
surprise ” to that section of the pnblio which comes—
from Melbourne. By the way, who can be writing these
funny little things in the D.T. now P Some man, evi-
deutly, who is not well. Can his illness be owing to the
ill-advised liberality of candidates during election time,
or to a yearning after his native Collingwood P If wo
had a man on our staff as sick as this, we should either
kill him at once to put him out of his misery, or place
him tenderly by the roadside to wait for the good
Samaritan. From a pnblio point of view, however, wo
feelingly call the attention ef our contemporary to the
former remedy.
In Monday’s Bum appears
the following Melbourne wire:—
i “ Mr. Michael Crawooon (sic), the
pawnbroker, of Williamstown, has
been fined £100 Dy the local bench
for smuggling 3300 cigars." In an
issue, a little while ago, it was
"Crawcourt;” now it is “Craw-
coon." The name, as the Herald
puts it, is, of course, " Crawoour.”
Now, the Bum is essentially a
Melbourne paper, and, as such, it
is surprising that it could possibly,
by any combination of adverse cir-
cumstance, make a mistake in the
name of a Melbourne pawnbroker !

Cardinal M'Cabe recently suspended Father
Dougherty of Brooklyn for getting up a pious horse-
race on Coney Island, in order to pay off a debt on his
church. 2,000 dollars were realized, and the rev. gentle-
man has had to refund every penny. They are evidently
more particular over there than we are here. Take, for
instance, our Olde Englyshe Fayres. There was no
horse-racing there, it is true; but there was nearly
every other amusement, barring a oat-fight. Perspiring

“ A young fellow with a fair income,” adver-
tised the other day in the Herald for a wife—‘‘a
domestic prefered." This “ ingenuous” ad. has com-
pletely taken in the Howl, which gravely recommends
"young fellows with fair incomes to marry domestics.”
Well, we know a gentleman who married his servant.
Next morning he taid—“ Now, Molly, got up and pre-
pare the breikfast." But she laughed at him. There-
fore he had to buckle to and fry some chops himself.
Then she yelled out that she would have her’s in bed.
So he took it up, and had the pleasure of seeing her

The We stepn Grazier doesn’t see how a

Edward E. P. Lowry, publican, near Sandhurst,
is a straightforward man. He kicked a bank-manager
into insensibility the other day and then robbed him.
There is a certain charity about this which will com-
parejfavourably with what has been the conduct of
certain other publicans whom we know, under similar
circumstances. They would have first “hooussed"
their man, then robbed him, and finally have given him
in charge for being on their premises with intent to
commit a felony. It is an edifyingsight to watch enter-
prising Christians of this sort driving their wives and
children to church on Sunday in the family buggy, and
to know at the same time that the irreverent rascals
would “ hocus” the ghost of Bishop Barker if It came
round their way and they thought it had anything iu
the shape of coin on it.

stables (sic) through them at
the intersections of the cart
tracks.” Coming from snob
au authority, we cannot doubt
the information. But it the
item appeared in a journal lei s
holy, we should be inclined to
be sceptical.

first, when, turning to hor husband, she said, “Oh,
Artaxerxes, look I He’s given me enough hash for a
rhinosoeros. You’d better take this. I knew your
landlady.” That evening Artax. went out for a solitary

It is rather a pity that Mr. C. J. Byrnes, M P.,
has not again seen fit to tackle Parramatta I Ha
is, in truth, a model member. He not only got the
other day from the Post Office a letter about the
Parramatta pump, which he duly published in the
Cumberland Fergy, bat he has since applied to the
Postmaster-General to make his department contribute
its quota towards watering the streets of his electorate !
To this the Secretary to the P.M.G. replied in this
strain: —“ I am directed to inform you that the Post-
master-General considers that this is scarcely a matter
to apply to the Government about, and the Minister for
Justioe agrees with him that the application should not
be entertained." There is a refinement of cruelty about
this answer, which makes ua shudder. Hera we see ah
active, intelligent membah snubbed for endeavouring to
benefit his electorate! Why shouldn’t the Post Office
pay for watering the streets of Parramatta, we should
like to know I Why shouldn’t the Colonial Secretary
rig out the pound-keeper or subsidise the town bull?
Now that Byrnes has published a letter from the Post
Office about the pump in the Feeqy, it is Huey’s turn

Goorangoola. It seems this
was a happy spot, a sort of
Auburn until some evil genius
started a movement to build a
Church there. Well, they got
their Church, had the farce of
consecration duly gone through
and then began the f nn. They
squabbled like true Christians
from that out, and at a late
holy service, a free fight took
place amongst; the congrega-
tion. According to accounts,
it was a scene that would have
done credit to a bano of down-
the-harbour larrikins. We-
recommend the Goo ran-
goolars to pension off the
parson with a pair of hosiery
gloves and a quid of Cavendish
and start a butcher’s shop in
the consecrated edifice. This
would tend to feeding their
bodies, without damning their
sonls.

He got home at length, and he
is thinking that, when all tbe
shot has been extracted, he
will have it made iato a statue
of himself, and present it to
the spring-gun man. It's a
Sue patent, but it hasn’t killed
any native dogs yet- For

out to be merely a fommoa well-boring machine, unable
to bore lower than 2J0 feet. It’s almost a pity for the

gentleman from Scotland, who came out to
Queensland on the immigrant ticket, lately wrote to a
paper up that way in the following polished and pun-
gent strain: —" The lowest class comes out (rae the
anld country; and there’s a good deal of them came
with this ship—Selkirkshire i As an assisted immegrant
I know it by exoepreanca of being among the lowest at
one time of my diy ” Judging by this last statement,
and the Scotch gentleman's literary style, wa think it
rathsr more than p-.hable that, before long ho will be
either an editor or a rmmber of Parliament.
There has been a man going about Hyde Park
for some time, whose claim to be the thirstiest, if not the
meanest man in the world, few could, with reason,
qu estion. He used to watch until the nurse-girls’ atten-
tion was disti acted by either the police or the military,
and then abstract i ho contents of the children’s feeding
bottles. Yet, strange to say, no sooner was the pro-
clamation for a dissolution published than he disap-
peared. It would be interesting to learn what constitu-
ency he will represent.
Says the S. F. News Letter “ We are
compelled to hold over, foe want of space, a lengthy
article giving nine new, cx’raordinary and deplorable
stories in illustration of the corrupt career of Paul
Neumann, candidate far Congress. It will appear nfxt
week." And strange to say, we are in the same predica-
ment. The only difference is that we arc compelled to
hold over /<m ever a lengthy article on a corrupt
politician, w* is now actively canvassing the electo-
rate of ■, hut we daren't even say that I
A new paper in Cairns (N.Q.) has bean smarted

We like this idea well. It’s a pity it is not more
generally followed. And this reminds us that the
snuffy old dames who go round collecting for Sydney
Charities might with advantage ha replaced by—say
their grand-danghters. We don’t part to female can-
vassers over 30—that is to say, not anything but
snuff.
The Maclbay Herald ia a go-a-head paper.

This journalistic cariosity is on view at tbe Maclvat
Herald office, and will be lent out to be read to honajide

Here is a true snake yarn. We say it is true
because the narrator is hero in company with a duo.
Up Cooktown way the gins smear tbeir piccauimes orer
every day with a good coat of fat, but a rumour having
reached the camp ore mornivg lately that a certain
King Billy had found a bottle of ram, and the gentry
were having hyginx with him in an adjacent paddock,
tho brunettes dropped their brats, and made for the
cheerful picnic. On their return, a large snake was
discovered in the act of swallowing one cf the young
'uns ; in fact, the little nigger was all down except his
feet, and the mother had barely time to grab her dar-
ling by the heels and haul him out again. We thus
see that it is foolish to do to day what can be dono to-
morrow, because if that piocaainy had been properly
greased as usual, he would have slipped along as slick
as a fat man falling down a cellar
The Melbourne police are a lively lot. They
have been proved to arrange robberies so that they may
get the kudos of capture, to consort with the demi-
monde, to ‘ borrow" money from innkeepers, to knock
iacffenfiva pedestrians down and then charge them with
assault, and, finally, to exoi' it the grossest cowtrdice
—as, for instance, in the K'lly-hit episode. It vi 1 be
remembered that a man named Boardmar, whom th'y
attempted to send up "onthevag" beeaum ho w mid
not decoy persons into crime for them, made a long list
of accusations against the detec'iv? force, not one of
which—if wo are to value Board man's cr dib lity in an
equal ratio with that of tin policemen—has ever been
refuted. Boardman said that he was obliged to be .a
bookmaker, as the detectives had hounded him out of
every respectable calling. Hecould never havethought,
it seems, then, of turning detec'ive.
Some considerable time ago the London papers
set the fashion of printing letters written to public men
in their colamns. Since then the fashion has run its
n«nal downward course from the salon to the scullery.
Tfee Redfeen Bag pnb ishos a letter in a recan" i-sue
addressed to—Heaven hd» ns !—“ Alderman Mulder”
Now the things we would like to know are these: Whom
Alderman Mulder, and who is the writer of this letur ?
From an admission in the epistle itself, "placed as I
in a position where I am bound to watch you public
men," we should judge the writer to be an Inspector
of Nuisances. The grave catechetical way in which
he tak-s this multy Mulnertotask for his doll house
dreadfulnesses is absurdly droll. However, as th°
majority of Aldermen can’t read, our musically-nou. d
friend may not feel particularly hurt by the Rag s
philippic. Mind, we don’t say that ho doesn’t belong
to the minority.
Two weeks ago we copied a “ loving remem-
brance" adv. from the Sydney Morning Misery,
which our readers may remember jogged along in this
wise
“Mo'her, d’.rlingj how we mis.-, thee,
tUnce thou hast gone fr-m here;
M»v angels watch and keep th-e,
Until we come to meet you there.”
Since then, the ah >ve “ In Memoriam," which is either
by Tennyson, or Phil M'Carroll—wo forget which—has
done duty five times—vis , for a father, brother, and
sister, the first ward, of course, being altered. Now,
this is getting a trifle monotonous, and besides, the
word “ there ” is tuo ambiguous, as it may mean either
hell or Parramatta We, therefore, sugeest that
"Mother darling” have a rest, and submit the following
fora change:—'‘At his residence, John M’Coy. who
didn't know the gun was loaded. Aged 47. His end
was all in pieces."
No more will I thump John M’Goy,
He's skipp’d from his loving Harriet;
He’s hurt, my every eaitnly j oy.
And he’s dead as J. Iicariot.
Now, that reads nice and gurgly, and whilst the word
“ thump " will touch a responsive chord ia the breast
of every married man, the certainty of old M'Coy’s
death is established beyond a doubt by comparison with
the late gentleman who used to “ carry the bag ” in
•’those" days.
Tho editor of the Gundagai Times h»s taken
away the localising adjective from the title of his
journal, which is now simoly but grandly known as The
Times Though we do not overlook the saving of type
and ink —a grave consideration in Qandaitai—which this
alteration will efiect, yet we think the editor is seriously
to blame for throwing into confusion the ideas of the
public upon current journalism iu this reckless manner.
He has thrust upon the proprietary of the other paper
of that name the neoessiry of calling it the London
Times. They will have to do this to protect themselves,
or they will at any time be liable to abuse for articles
which appeared in the other Times. Why need vou
causa all this bother, O Qundagai thunderer ? But,
Elworthy, you sly dog, you kaow the eyes of Europe
are on you, and you won’t recant. Faugh 1 If you were
to call your pleasant little paper The Corpse, and bury
it, do you think anyone sxoept the loial butcher would
miss it? We are sick of this Cockney servility, which
makes the otherwise intelligent inhabitants of this naw
country scramble for English names to give to every,
thing they have tho naming of. Somo ountry papers in
this colony ought to be cilled well, if they were
called n thing it wouldn’t be a lie.
The Eev. Arthur Graves, the Elmore clergyman
wh > exhibited such a fondness for oysters, has dre-p »d
into a bit of bad luck once more. He has got twelve
months for an otfanoa which cm, perhaps, best bo
described by the term—making an exhibition of hira-elf.
Hero now is a promising young member of the Church
lo->t for a period to the universe. This is very sad to
reflect on. Why, what will the sinners of Elmore do
during his twelve months’ incarceration? Who will
cure their souls for them, and comfort with spiritual
ministration the wives and familifis of the men who are
away fencing at the 10-mile? We suppose, hawevtr,
tkst since the Victorian Government have thought fit
te release the holy Bank of Vintoria gold robber, and
for the good of the community set free a certain lamb-
like usurer, they will not care about imperilling
public morality and the interests of religion, by keep-
ing the Eev. Arthur Graves looked up longer than can
possibly be avoidei. Allowance should always ha msde
for the eccentricities of both the holy and tho wealthy.
The management of the Melbourne Hospital
seems to hive been temporarily entrusted to a sot of
dipsomaniacs Dr. Qilibee —a veteran practitioner-
objected at the late hospital eleotion lately to the
enormously excessive prescribing of stimulants which
has been customary there for some time past Imme-
diately the licensed victuallers, with their clientele of
onnter-lunchers and Har-bummers, rolled up and de-
feated Gillbae. The Melbourne organ of mis class
exults over the discreditable victory in this fashion:
“What a miserable total of Gillbeeites mustered up.
. . A terrible set of frauds, are they not ? Lacking
charity, generosity, morality, and deficient even in
numerical strength.” We don’t blame the dreg-drinker
who wrote this, for we suppo=e he has to live somehow.
But we blame the people who take this Licensed Vic-
tualler paper for allowing it to suggest that patients
should be whiekiad to death for the sake of the paltry
profits to be made out of supplying a sick ward with
liquor.
The amenities of journalism are not strictly
obierved in the rural districts of Missouri. The Marile
Hill Reflector refers to a rival as follows : “ Tho
ignorant, contemptible, mean, sneaking, cowardly, self-
important, low-flung, dirty, outlandish, back.biting,
self-styled ‘ politician,’ dead beat, whisky bloat, back-
woods bummer, log-cabin child of misfortune, beer-
inflated, big-headed, soft-skubed, overrated swamp
angel, who claims to edit the Swamp paper, thinks the
editor of the Reflector terribly ignorant. Let him
look at tho twenty -seven mistakes in his last issue; let
him remember the • blantant ’ in the issue before ; and
let him not forget that he used ‘ ardorous’ for arduous
in a leading local in his issue of August 24. Oh, yon
dirty whelp; you poor, crawling, creeping viper: you
dirty scum of the dirty, stinking, stagnated swamp ;
yon mean, big jawed, slab-sideo, knock kneed, bow-
legged, banderea shanked pnp; lost, as you are, to
honesty, to principle, to justice, to common decency,
do imagine you can rule God’s country—the hills ? Go
back iito the cesspool from which you have crawled,
and there remain. Don’t cone out of mar den to
abuse repectable people. O' 1 to school, Kelly, and you

Jamie Watson returned —to Sydney.
What Mr. Barton said on Thursday morning :
“ Toby or not Toby, that is the question."
“ Hang it!" cried Tom O’Mara; “ here’s little

“The electors of West Maitland are full of Full-

give an account of his stewardship when tho “ weather

the late member for Maitland must bo pretty warm,
for, though he was two years in the ’Ouse, he never
kept his promise. This is unpardonable, bat bo shows
tns gratitude to the electors in another way. He
announces to them “ I do not intend to offer myself for
re-election." leave yourself the trouble, old boy, but
give us a reason. Surely we’re entitled to that.

David Buchanan addressing the electors of

Ib it true that, before the declaration of the
Eftf-t Sydney poll w»a mida, a subdued individual went
to the Telegraph Office, and handed in—not over the
public counter, but—to the “ boss,” upstairs, a batch o(
about a dozen telegrams ; that, concerning these te'e-
grams, he gave “orders" to rush them along immedi-
ately; and that those “ wires” ran somewhat thusly: —
‘‘Defeated. Call friends together, organize a monster
meeting earnestly requesting Sir Bowlsd.out Boa nos to
stand for your district. Telegraph petition and largo
number of signature* at once. Spare no expanse.

Is it also trne that some of these telegrams were sent
to persons holding dummy selections, to others em-
ployed on very remunerative Government contracts,
and to civil servants ? Is it true, fnrthermore, that the
public business was delayed in order that those
“ urgc.Ht” messages might take precedence ? We don't
know. We only know that next day Sir Henry Parkes
received telegrams from eight “ great centres " asking
hits to “'allow himself to be nominated.” The next
Poabmaster-Qoaeral may clear out a few telegraphic
pigeon-holes, by and bye.

The parsons hold “the Almighty" responsible
for all the disturbances of nature—droughts, floods
and hurricanes. Now, some time ago, the root of the
Wesleyan Church, Balmain, was blown off. Perhaps
"“ e , . Pmns " people will have the effrontery to tell us
that tha Almighty shifted the roof of His ewn house ?
Or are we at Uberty to form our own interpretation—
that Providence doesn’t recognise the Wesleyans P AH
of which reminds us of the old Dutchman who. when
asked to subscribe towards the ao*t of a lightning rod.

We read a yarn the ether day about an alarm of

story wound up with a description ofhowthe assemblsd
crowd were astonished becausi -on a sudden a man
issued from the sacred retreat of the holy women of
the church, trying to avoid recognition. But nnfor-
tunatolv for him his habiliments and figure were only
too well known, with his clean shaved face and bull-dog
neck and white stock, evidently put on in a hurry.

The other evening, at the meeting of the Synod
of Eastern Australia, hold at St. George’s Hall, Castle-
reigh-street. a warm discussion was proceeding between
the worthy brethren, and at some remarks made by one
of the said brethren, there was pretty general applanse.
This, evidently, wa*n t in the programme of a certain
cleno present, for he immediately rose to a “ point of
order," and said: “Mr. Moderator, this is not like a
pubhc-housa—this is not like a theatre—it’s worse.
It s a lot of male and female blackguards " Where-
upon another holy man got up on his hind legs and
went towards the speaker in a menacing attitude (his
fist doubled up in a knot all the time); "Esverend
brother, withdraw that—my wife is present." He
didn t use these exact words, but our report is near
enough. Thera was a terrific row over the affair, and

Ingersoll says no such man as Noah ever
existed. He probably bases his belief on the assump-
tion that no man would invite a pair of mosquitoes
into the ark.
The Egyptian campaign was rump steak against
water-melons, pots of porter versus half-penny glasses
of sherbet, and the rnmp steaks made short work of
their antagonists.
A woman has suggested that when men break
their hearts it is all the same as when a lobster breaks
one of his slaws—another sprouts immediately and
grows in its place.
Mr. Furner has been elected Chairman of Com-
mittees of the S.A. Legislative Assembly, vice the
renowned Billy Townsend, deceased. Wallaroo has now
two deadheads, practically, in Parliament, as the other
member, E. D. Boss, is Speaker. There was a rumpus
over the election. Three candidates were first sub.
mitted: Turner, John Carr, and Bright. The latter
retired, and a caucus meeting decided for Parmer by a
majority of one. This brought out Symon, the over-
ready Ebby Ward, Colton and Hawker, and they took
the question to a division in the house. Purner won by
four votes. Ebby Ward was so shocked that he de-
clared he felt half a mind to resign his seat —a threat
which was satirically cheered. The only contingency
upon which Ebby is likely to resign will arise if he
should ever have to go insolvent again. Purner is a
little, black-headed, shrewd man who dabbles in land-
agency business, and is, we believe, a barrister, though
ho never practices. Carr is a sturdy old farmer, who
dates bis parliamentary experience from 1864, and has
been a Minister of the Crown, and Chairman of Com-
mittees several times. He is a shining Methody light,
and elocntes’in the orthodox local preacher style.

James Lillywhite, the well-known English
cricketer, is dead. None so popular amongst our
English visiting teams as the burly and bluff Jem Lilly-
white. Peace be to his ashes; his memory will be kept
green by the cricketers of both hemispheres.
Mr. F. Ironside’s suggestion that a match be ar-
ranged between the English Team and 21 juniors, with
a coach, has been carried into effect as regards Mel-
bourne, but though the Hon. Ivo looks with favour on
the scheme, there is no chance of such a fixture being
arranged up here, as the Association Ground trustees
cannot see anything in the idea. Mr. Ironside also con-
templates making arrangements for a Junior Inter-
colonial match. For making things hum for the junior
cricketers, Mr. Ironside is a veritable “try-it-on”
amongst the minnows.
The Commissioner explains : —Indiscriminate
applications for free railway passes were becoming a
very objectionable practice. To give facility to the
continuance of athletic sports, excursion tickets at
half the usual rates will he always available for those
who take part in intercolonial and international con-
tests. There will be no objection to issue free passes
to the members of the English team who wish to visit
places of interest in the colony, such as the Zigzag;
but the Government will not issue passes for the oriok-
keters to travel from one place to another for the pur-
pose of playing matches.
The recreant Australians were banqueted in
Melbourne, and the Hon. Ivo B'igh’s team were
present. Murdoch, in responding to the toast of the
Australian Eleven, said that his team had three bard
tasks before them in contests with the Englishmen, and
he sincerely hoped the latter would not win. The Hon.
Ivo Bligh in responding to the toast of his team said
that, only for the kind promises of assistance and co-
operation made by the Australians generally, his Eleven
would never have been able to come to Australia. He
hoped, before concluding their tour, to be able to regain
the revered ashes of English cricket, which had been
laid on the shelf in England by the Australian Eleven.
The most remarkable points about the match
on the Association Ground were C. T. Studd’s batting
and Evans’ bowling and fielding. Sn C. T. didn't seem to
be at home at all; he quite disappointed the expecta-
tions of those who have read of his prowess as a bats-
man, and he played a very bungling innings. However,
we are told he is not wall, and we will leave it at that
until he gets a hundred or so. Evans’ bowling, so true
and so constant, all the day was surprising, and the two
catches he made were phenomenal. Bates, whom he
caught with his left hand, thought the ball was going
over the fence when he hit it. Bead’s hit was some-
thing similar, but the Fakir got hia two paws on to the
ball.
The English Eleven were too tired on reaching
at Sydney to permit of the formality of a recep-
tion. However, on their arrival at the Association
Ground, the cricketers and delegates assembled with
the trustees of the ground to give them a cordial greet-
ing in the eommif-.ea room Mr. Toece, in his happiest
style, made the welcoming, and the Hen. Ivo Bligh
neatly responded. We do not think we shall fall out
with our visitors. They represent the type of English,
men that we like. Good fellowship beams in each face
of the strangers: these who have visited us before we
know, and we wish the team a jolly good trip through
the colonies. Thera seems to be with this team an
absence of thf.t “side" which has hitherto repelled
colonials from fraternising with the English gentlemen
cricketers.
“ Butterfi igera ” writes in Tuesday’s Heeald
Suggesting t aat the following should play for N.S.
Wales against the English team:—D., E., and C.
Gregory, Coates, Sheridan, Evans. Powell, Paithfull,
Thompson, Hewitt, Tindall, and C. Bannerman. He
evidently wants veterans; if so, why does he leave out
Harry Hilliard, W. C. Still, Orry and Tom Lewis, Al.
Park, George and Jemmy Moore, Charley Lawrence,
Harry Newoombe, Jack Kettle. Mount Clarkson, and
Sydi Jones. V r hy not go to the Devonseire-street ceme-
tery at once ? The only difficulty we can see about the.
matter is that not sufficient veterans can be found to
get the Englishmen out in a three days’ match. Ik was
the sticking to the old names that got us so many
Intercolonial defeats. Oat of the twelve that “ Butter-
fingers ’’ mentions, not more than four are fit for selec-
tion in such a team as played for N.S. Wales against
the Englishmen. ■' ,{
The Hon. Ivo Bligh has not yet played with Jus
team owing to an accident, but we have had an oppor-
tunity ef centemplating the Hon. Ive’s shoes. They
measure fully thirteen inches. When such a captainr
puts hia foot down, eo to speak, who shall gainsay him f
None of the members of the English team are remark,
able for small feet, but, when the Hon. Ivo takes the
floor, he distances all his companions. On Thursday
last, a number of gentlemen otme out to see the Eng-
lishmen play, but they arrived too late. However, the
Hon. Ivo’s shoes were shown to them, and they were
more th&n satisfied. N.S. Wales, in her match with
the English team, has been spared from the infliction
of these pedal phenomena; bat who can predict success
for the Australian Eleven if the Hon. Ivo’s shoes are
pitted against them ? They are simply unique in their
grandeur—stupendous, sublime. The Hon. Ivo must
be a grand fieldsman because he fulfils the first requisite
—ho covers a lot of ground.
A two nights’ wrestling match at Chriatohnrch,
N.Z., between Bobinson and Slade, caused immense
excitement. The terms were, “ to wrestle in Cumber-
land style, the best or most falls out ©f seven, the
winner to take the whole of the money, £50, the match
to be for the championship of New Zealand." Slade’s
backer was Mr. Jem Mace, while Bobinson was
backed by Mr. J. Olphert. Each man is a half-caste,
tall, and powerfully bnilt. During the first night’s
wrestling, about eight good “ grips” were obtained, in
three of which one of the two was thrown. The general
opinion was that Slade showed most science, while
Bobinson was, perhaps, slightly the stronger man, and
had decidedly the advantage in wind, Slade appearing
much out of breath after each try. In the first bent en
the Monday night, nothing resulted, neither man
throwing his opponent, bat, in the second, Slade broke
his hold, Bobinson, therefore, scoring a fall. The
third bout produced a very severe tussle, but no score.
Bobinson threw his opponent in the fourth round, and
a quarter of an hour’s rest followed. On resuming, the
excitement was intense, each of the wrestlers being
heartily cheered on making his appearance in the ring.
After grappling for a short time, Slado brenght Eobin-
son down on his knees. The score was now even, each
man claiming three falls. Odds were freely laid on
Bobinson, who justified his backers’opinions by quickly
throwing Slado on his back. Eobinson’s victory was
very popular, three cheers being given for him.
The bad N.S. Wales Eleven was beaten by the
English Eleven in one innings by 144 runs. N.S
Wales want first to the wickets and scored 152. Marr,
by steady confident play made top score, 34; Powell
came next with a well earned 22. Moses played a
vigorous innings for 21. Davis made 18 by capital
cricket, and then throw hia wicket away by running out
at Steel and missing him. Evans played well for 10,
and Callaohor made some lively strokes for his 11.
Giary was shaping wall when he was run out. A. Q.
Steel got five wickets for 33 runs. The Englishmen
went in for big scoring, and succeeded in compiling 461
rnns. Leslie, who is one of the grandest batsmen the
Association Ground has seen, made 144. His style is
free and easy. When he hits he puts the 11 wood ” on;
when he defends, he lets the ball do most of the strik-
ing. He gave a hot chance early in his innings to Davis,
who dropped the ball without anyone telling him.
Barlow played better than ever for his 80 runs Bead
played a grand innings for 46. Bates made 30, A. G.

and Barnes a defensive 13. The N.S. Wales men made
165 in their second innings. They commenced auspici-
ously, Davis and Geary putting up 60 runs before they
were parted; then Geary, after playing a good innings
for 22, was canght off Bead’s slows. Davis made a long
stand, and played magnificent cricket for his 85. Dur-
ing his innings some of the English fieldsmen showed
the colonials how to miss a catch or two. Powell
played an effective innings for 32, not out. None of the
other batsmen made double figures. Evans and
Hiddleston ran themselves out rather foolishly. Bar-
low got three wickets for 18.

Bell’s Life considers, with all due deference to the
Australian crieketers, that Feate is the best bowler in
the world. The same paper told off a special reporter
to accompany the Australians on their tour, and the
conclusion he came to, after reporting all their matches,
was that “good as the Australians are, they are not
equal to the very best English teams when the ground
is in good order.” The Bussian Minister of War,
having found the grant of prizes for horse-racing in-
effectual in inducing military officers to perfect them-
selves in riding, decided to render the races at the camp
of Krasno Selo of a compulsory character. These
came off in October, and resulted in five officers being
more or leas injured, a dozen horses spoilt, and one
horse killed on the spot. Among the winners was a son
of the present Minister of the Interior.

Mrs. John Hirdie’s juvenile fancy ball, on
Thursday evening, wis a deoidad success, over 60 young
people in rainbow raiment whiling the happy hours
away. Mias Plorrie, in whose honour the hall* was
given, looked pretty as Folly. Miss Hincholitf, as an
Ambulance Nurse, was perfect.in detail. Master Alfred
Hardie was a Middy; Miss Minnie Wilson was Dally
Varden, with an eyeglass in her ocular; and Mias
Winifred Wilson looked nice as Phoebe Mayfliwer.
Mrs G. J. Roberts’s daughters appeared as the two
Orphans ; Master Willie Williamson was a tall soldier ;
and Miss M'Klhone (daughter of the immortal John)
was a pretty Spanish Girl. Little Miss Nellie Ander-
son was voted belle, in the character of New South
Wales. Miss Flossy Keddia was Nancy Lie; Miss O
Hhadler, a Turkish Lady; and Masters C mil and Jack
Alderson were tailors. The host was Master of the
Honnds. The usual mixed characters filled up the
number; and music was supplied by De Green

Wraps and ulsters were the rule at the Asso-
ciation Ground on Friday ; but, considering the bleak
weather, there was a good number of ladies present.
Those on the lawn who had the hardihood to appear in
light dresses (their winter velvet being laid by for the
season) were obliged to go in for lively walking exercise
to keep np the tainperature. The wife of a solicitor
woro a handsome seaibrown, trimmed with satin; and
a dress that combined several shades ot French gray in
striped silk, with flounce of grey check, was nice and
unique-. The new members for East Sydney, who ao
comnanied one another to the ground, were cheered ou
entering. On Saturday it was different: a oool morn,
ing became warm as the day wore on, aud the popular
afternoon was as bright and cheerful aa the well-dressed
fair ones could wish. The stand was neatly full, a
thick crowd edged the ring, and the high fence opposite
was adorned with a neat fringe of youthful legs. The
youth who would dangle his legs for hours over the top
of a fence, which, like Euclid's straight line, is all
" length without breath," must be very eathnsiastio
about cricket. As to the play, our eleven were not in
it to any extent. They played a level game; that
is to say, they missed about as many bills as they
stopped. When they did stop a ball, before the fence
did, they generally did it with ther feet. We did not
know this was the correct way to do it before,
bat perhaps our men have feet specially adapted
for that purpose. Indeed, on close inspection,
wo found this to be so; and in one or two cases it
would be almost strange if a ball ever got safely past
them. We believe if our talented eleven had b t ea
allowed to catch the ball in their hats, they would have
won the game Of the pretty things in dress, the
prettiest was an aii-whita plush, made in coat jacket
shape with lappels thrown back like a gentleman’,,
showing a glimpse of linen; skirt of same, putted and
kilted. The fashionable wife ot a Pitt-stnet auctioneer,
wore a tasteful dove cashmere and peacock satin, hat to
match. Two pretty, quiet costumes, were from Stan-
more, just alike; polonaise of glistening sage green
satin with pleated breast and double row ot buttons,
and dove or lavender cashmere skirts, kilted aud
gathered. From Darlinghurst, came a portly lady ia
black sateen with pink rose pattern, aud t lack satin
lodice with pit k ribbons. A lady cavalieted by a yousg
lawyer who has a large practice—on the afternoon
block—appeared In a blue check polonaise, trimmed
with white lace, and a kilted underskirt of cobalt blue,
sable mantlet A pair of dove-watered silks were good.
Peculiar wis a China silk with collarette of maroon,
and stripes of same down the skirt, held with buckles,
one maroon kilting round the bottom. A Judge coa-
ducted his petite daughter, who was in neat white
linen, with a brilliant-hued Indian silk seatf. From
Palmer-street came a nice claret gtosgrain, trimmed
with velvet aud fringe to match. A satin
brochti of bright chaudrou, or copper red, was
noticeable. A handsome lady from Carrabella-street
wore black satin trimmed with old white lace. From
Glebe, two light fawns of twilled cashmere (Alexandra
cloth), with brochd trimmings of the same tint, were
exceedingly pretty and tasteful. A young lady ia loose
white linen, with scarlet flowers at the throat, excited
interest by her continual struggles to retain possession
of an enormous hat, which the wanton wind persisted
in whipping eff every now and then. It wasn’t suitable
to a windy day, but its great white circumference of
brim made a capital bao'tground to a pretiy face. No
donbt its owner was satisfied Cgst asses;. A mahogany
brown broche, and wine-coloured velvet bodice, were
shaded by a white satin parasol, on iVhioh was the
singular device of a large golden horseshoe. We looked
all over the parasol for a hammer and a box of nails,
but they weren’t there. Very re Markable were three
ladies, who might have been the danghtera of Crocs is—
there was so much gold about them The three drrsits
were quite alike in colour, and marly so in make, and
were wonderfully rich is their different shades of go d.
The bodice was warm gold satin, also most of the skirt,
which was flnically puffed and gathered in rows; drap-
ings of pale gold brochd fell over the hips, aud were
bunched behind, a breadth of same round th* lower
skirt, yellow lace trimmings ; hat and feather all of the
same hue. A ruby satin, with bodice and long train
of shot ruby and gold, drew attention to a figure
that was as symmetrically circular as if just finished
off a turning lathe : while a pretty little costume, con-
sisting of black silk jacket bodice, and oraam oatmeal-
oioth skirt, was peculiar—because the bunching of the
skirt made tbe ends of the bodice stick out behind in a
manner strikingly suggestive of a chicken with an un-
developed tail. A Uttle lady under the care of a Cos
toms’ officer wore a nicely fitted pink sateen drape!
with bronze green silk of most fanciful design—quite
an aesthetic conception. Twoyoupg ladies, by pan ding
a good deal in the early afternoon, afforded opportunity
of inspecting the stylish makes of their white flowered
sateens, one having mauve, the other cream, kilted
underskirt: both wearing tilted hats of tbe most
rakish kind. A noticeable dress was of silver check
eilk, the panier bodice drawn back over the hips and
bunched, and a queen-of-browns satin skirt. Twenty-
four pretty “ musics ’’ were played by the German
Band in the smoking reserve. On Monday, the show of
dresses was meagre; one of the best was a beautiful
heliotrope satin from Harris-street, gathered and
puffed, and trimmed with white lace. A wondrous
head of hair, which came from a Kmg-street hostelry,
attracted universal attention. And twp handsome
young ladles wore respectively, cream Japanese silk,
and blue sateen. No band played. Just when wo
needed it so.

Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Ellis entertained a party of
friends at their residence, Darlinghurst, on tbe 28th
ultimo. A programme of nearly twenty dances wis
carried through, and during the evening the Mieses
Healy favoured with vocal music. A pale pink ta5i«
and pale blue was one of the prettiest characters
present; a stately Catnperdown lady wote cream eilk
and lace and cardinal brocle with effect; and a blonde
from Double Bay in pale blue with cream lace
trimmings was much admired. The gallants looked
sombre as usual, of course, but were agreeable. One
couple had some difficulty in discerning the diffsie ice
between a polka and a galop. At about 4 o’clock, the
pleasant party ended.

A young lady tired of living at home with her
parents, her father being on strike, attempted to elope
fast week with a neighbouring butcher boy. She tried
to let fferself down from the balcony of the paternal
residence by means of one of the bed sheets. She slit
the sheet and came to lie ground suddenly. The
seiions injuries she experieni cd caused her to cry out
for aid, hut there came, instead of the batcher boy, her
enraged father. Sh.e is now confined to bed, and the
doctor says she will not be able to walk for some time.
This being the second time she has attempted an elope,
meat unsuccessfully, she may be considered to be an
unlucky girl.

The Salvation Army started on Sunday. The
audience chiefly consisted of females past the prime of
life, and wearing hats of the last century, " Captain ”
Sutherland is ill, sc Mrs. Sutherland conducted. . She
were a long, light ulster, with cuffs and stick-up collar
bound with red, military fashion. ‘'Lieutenant”
Canty wore a militfiry (Jupk coat tjrailarly bound, and
carried a cornet case. All wqre silver badges, or tin.
After preliminaries, a young man strung off his

peated over and over; he had been very wicked till he
"found tbe Jjird" —bow he’s as happy as a K.C.B.
Young man number two then rose : he professed what
great pleasure it gave him to stand up aud let every
one know what he bad and hadn’t done. He had been
tremendously wicked, far wickeder than number one.
so bad that the sailors once said to him, “ O, for God’s
sake, knock off, or the ship will sink! " Ami ha didn't
knock off. But he did not say what became of the
ship. He is now saved ! “ Lieutenant ” Canty then
repeated his lesion. Ha admitted right away that he
had never stood np to each a reap ictable audience
before in his life. From which we deduce—ah. well,
never mind. He didn’t blow any oa the cornvt;
which disappointed us. M’s. Sutherland spoke
for thirty-five minutes Sue ie young, apparently
hub little over twenty, with an interesting face shaded
b j ■*. plain straw hat, and a provincial intonation. She
says tnat aha and her husband are paid £2 10s. a weak
for their work, but expenses have to be met by "the

every other scn’ence occurred ttye phrase " unfurl the

Mr. and Mrs. J. Devlin gave a ball at “ Clov-
elly,” Ashflsld, on Puday last, which was largely and
fashionably attended, anouc 120 being present, and,
thanks io the discreetness in issuing invitations, ladies
and gentlemen wore equally divided. There were
neither wails lined with forlorn maidens, nor doots
blocked by despondent jou'hs unable to find partners ;
but the social halaoco wav just ou the poise The
grounds and verandahs we o i.laminated with Chinese
lanterns, and in the early evening, before the supper

England won’t recognise Baker Pasha as com-

assumed charge of the gendarmes. I« the youthful
folly of Col. Baker never to be expiated P
Arabi pleads guilty to rebellion, and is to be
exiled, retaining, however, his sword, rank as Pasha,
and his emoluments! Which is tantamount to an admis-

He let two trains meet each other on one line of rails.
Result: —One man detd, a few more, cut of fourteen

Charles Thomas—no relation to the Henry
family P—is the " Devonport Loan Agency, ’’ of New
Zealand, and he has been county-conrting several
*-squat zed lemons’* who had no more juice. At the
-Stouehouse Conut.y Court, one defendant alleged that
the plaintiff charged him 23.. a quarter for a loan of
£6 For tnis £6 he has a ready paid £7, and he was
now fued for £8 for reuewiug tbe Pill ami interest. It
way contended on behalf of Thomas that the law did
not prohibit moaey-lendara from extorting exorbitant
interest, and if the plaintiff claimed his pound of flssh,
there was no alternative out to grant it. The judge
ordered the defendant to p iy the claim in Is. per month
inetal oents, thus extending the period of payment
over fifteen years. O her claims were treated in the
same fashion. One 4- feidant said the piaimiff wanted
to charge him 3 61. for a week’s loan of 10s , or 1800
