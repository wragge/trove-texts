THE RED PAGE
ILLUSION.
She beckoned me over the misty rise,
Her radiant feet were bare,
The grey-blue dawn dreamed in her eyes,
Stars glimmered in her hair.
She murmured the spell of Paradise —
And Paradise was there!
“O follow me, Love, wherever I will,
And lose thy soul with me,
Deep in the shadowy scrub, where still
Broods grey-winged mystery,
And strange dim flowers are dreaming, till
I waken them for thee.”
I fled with her far from the golden light,
Deep into the brooding shade,
Where startled pinions swooped from sight,
And dim dream-flowers swayed,
But ever I followed the flickei'ing white
Bare feet that never stayed.
“0 follow me, Love, where the mountains
tower,
And the eagle,' circling high,
Sails over the dazzling clouds, that lower
Above earth’s tarnished sky,
And the glaciers guard the azure flower
Of immortality.”
I climbed in search of the glittering bloom
Through chasms black as night,
And staggered on through the blinding gloom,
Of everlasting light,
Where I stumbled over a nameless tomb —
And still I followed her flight.
“O follow me down where the lighthouse
glows
‘ Good-bye' to the dying sun,
And the silent river seaward flows,
Whose course is nearly run,
And sinless quietude shall close
Life’s battle lost —and won.”
I followed her, dreaming of dreamless sleep—
The sleep that never shall be!
For whenever the wings of the southerly
sweep
Through the dream of the slumbering sea,
Her white feet glimmer along the deep,
And I hear her calling me —
“O follow me, Love, wherever I will,
And lose thy soul with me,
Deep in the shadow of death, where still
Broods grey-winged mystery.
And strange star-flowers are dreaming, till
I waken them for thee.”

The Pervertosensicon
From my earliest remembrance of him
Upsigh Doune was addicted to doing things
wrong way up.
Last week he burst into my attic, his eyes
aglow with enthusiasm, his clothes ou, shirt
outside, as usual —dragging behind him a
weird mass of machinery upon wheels,
“This,” he exclaimed, forgetting in his ex-
citement to talk backwards, or stand upon
his hands, “ This is the PERVERTO-
SENSICON. ... It is the greatest triumph
in inversion of the era, and can be
constructed in various types. No. IA, for
instance, immediately inverts the truth of
anything placed in its receiving slot. I ex-
pect a gi-eat sale of 1A among explorers,
mining experts, and Tory leader-writers. And
the machine before you possesses the ines-
timable property of reversing the idea con-
tained in any poem, expeditiously, and with-
out pain to the operator. One should be
found in every verse-writer’s household. In-
valuable for inverted psalms, and will not
injure the most delicate poetic fabric! Al-
low me” He pounced upon a book f-rom
my shelves and tore a page out at random.
“ ‘Never Again,’ by that dangerous fellow
McCrae,” he continued. “We will just
feed this into the main cylinder.”
Suiting the action to the word he crawled
carefully underneath his invention, feet
first. Emerging, he wrenched over a lever,
and the whole mechanism sprang into move-
ment —whirring, throbbing, and hooting, till
the whole building shook with the vibration.
Finally, with a mechanical spasm, the Per-
vertosensicon vomited forth at our feet a
square foot of paper imprinted with irregu-
lar type of a scarlet color.y I seized it
eagerly and read :
EVER AGAIN.
She looks on me with sterner eye than dun,
And, swooping with a comprehensive spring
Pounces upon me, crying “ You’re the One!”
At mid-day: and the boarders, as we cling,
Laugh from their secret lairs like anything.
Ever indefors, or on the holey pave,
Beyond the limit of the green flag bent
By Board of Works about its street-hewn
cave,
She waits to grab me: no more sure event
Than she: as sure as Agent for the Rent.
Ever again ! Although beneath a couch
I crawl, half-stifled, full of fluff, and swear,
Or low behind the parlor-piano, crouch
Waiting her figure—forty, fat and fair —
To re-ascend th’ unvarnishable stair. ...
I hide from her in labyrinthine bars
Of pubs distilling alcoholic bane,
Or from a cab-rank catch th’ electric cars —
A pathway from her to the Melbourne train;
In vain, in vain: She’ll capture me again!
While I still stood spellbound in horror at this
desecration, Mr. Doune had already fed his
infernal machine with another leaf. I had
just time to observe that Brennan’s “Ro-
mance” was missing from my “Golden Trea-
sury,” when the miscreant handed me an-
other red-typed effusion with a low bow, and
I perused:—
FACT.
To-night, in a room in a cafe
( . . . clear out! . . . don’t I tell you it s
Px-ivate! . . .)
O, folded close to her chest!
—and every dash’d petty annoyance
(was, it Cats? or a private detective
concealed in a shadowy corner,
that giggled and chuckled and coughed!)
—the weight of the lady,
made worse by my aching rheumatics . . .
supporting twelve stone on my knees —•
—clear out! ... can’t you see that’s its
Private!! . . .
close-locked in her terrible arm-grasp
no word do I utter . . . I’m smothered :
, the silence of choking . . . and swears . . .
only l-ound and over us
that cheerless, intimate gaslight,
and the waiter with serviette rustling,
hovering round for his tip.
. . . . clear out! . . . don’t I tell you it’s
PRIVATE!!.. . .
to-night, in a room in a cafS,
O, folded tight to her chest! . . .
“Vastly improved in the perverting, on
my honor!” cried the busy inventor, deftly
scissoring a page from another booklet, and
jamming one of Le Gay Brereton’s poems
into the main cylinder.
“But what will you produce as the oppo-
site idea to ‘Open Speech’?” I demanded.
“‘Backbiting,’ of-course,” responded Doune
confidently; but the mechanism must have
slipped a cog while puzzling out the anatomy,
for what we eventually got was—
THE EAR-BITER.
Good frenno’ mine, you’ve sush frank eyes:
You weep with me, you sympathise!
You’re—hie/ —the besht I ever knew:
Then shay—l want a quid from you !
One single quid—to spend in Beer!
Goo’ fren’, I won’t be alwaysh here —-
Might die, before the beer’sh in view;
Hie, fx-en’! I ask a quid from you.
Shee—when I pass you in the street,
It seems our thirsty spirits meet
In one large thirsty wish —that’sh true!
So shay—about that quid from you?
Are you, too, longing for a burst,
Yet wait to hear me broach it first?
Well, hang it all! You’ve got the cue!
And — hid— l’d like a quid from you.
Some way our thoughts together club,
Since both lift eyes towards a pub,
Towards the self-shame pints o’ brew:
Then shout—l want a quid from you.
“But, see here,” I protested weakly,
“that’s not a genuine upside-down idea.
If” —— The roar of the machine drowned
my voice. Looking over, I saw that the
inventor, had just crammed Bernard
G’Dowd’s “Mystery” into its seething in-;
terior. In 45 seconds it hooted cheerfully,;
and suddenly deposited in my lap,
REALITY.
The omnipresent “Mystery”
No sciences ignore:
She is thg yet-untravelled sea
To-morrow sailed by Lore.
If fever of rebellious vein
Call up her shadow dim,
Compel agnostic Solon’s reign
To pass to Her from Him,
Shall with the Mystic seers in these
Our drugged pretensions peer,
Read God in emptied granaries,
Praise primal prates of Fear —
The atavistic ravages,
The neolithic strain,
That lures the city savages
To-day to pray for rain?
Nay, Sense’s “No” to Mystic’s “Yes”!
The sense-paths, free from Doubt,
Have slowly built his Consciousness
From the Greater World without:
Have one by one made “Knowing” his—
Life’s real existence brought
From out the great material “Is”
In picture-gifts of thought.
The Ego’s part, these gifts to think:
This palace buiPt, to ’fine:
To sort, to add, to judge, to link,
Arrange and re-combine —-
Yea, credent sage shall eat his Word,
And in Truth’s mirror see
His Mystic World the image blurred
Of fair Reality!
“Why,” I exclaimed in astonishment, “it
makes a kind of sense!”
“I said the machine would give a true op-
posite,” replied Upsigh Doune, much
pleased. Then he fed the whirling cogs with
Bayldon’s “Sunset,” and the ejector ejacu-
lated —
DAWNBREAIv.
The purple p’liceman slumbers like a log:
Flaunting thro’ Sky’s blood-tinctured jew-
ell’ry /
Burst billion cannonades of stars — i.e.,
They are the flagrant diamond-studs which
clog
The vast white shirt-front of the red-gilled
Dawn.
In the proud East all midnight’s Black Hus-
sars
Take off their regal trousers gemm’d with
stax-s,
And put their ’mperious trombones into
Pawn. . . .
“This poet,” I said, greatly impressed,
“only needs Inversion to become truly
Great.”
“On the contrary,” sharply returned my
friend, as he pushed Arthur Adams’ “Bond
Street” into the feeding slot, “Inversion
would give him a sense of humor, and he’d
never write another line.”
The Pervertosensicon drowned further ar-
gument by a great outbreak of moans,
sparks, thuds and buzzing, which finally re-
sulted in a scarlet-lettered outbreak titled
BLUDGER LANE.
’Mid reek of stale mixed alcohols
Unseeing coppers stand like dolls:
While leprous Chinamen flit by
Past caravanserais of Molls.
Decayed bananas rot and strew
The lazy gutter’s channel through:
And 10, down stagnant alleys bloat
The stray dogs’ corpses, two by two!
I see a pale cop past me whiz.
Great need of speed from thence is his,
For Nick the Nark is dancing on
The gin-soaked chest of Lousy Liz.
A languid Burglar marks the brawl,
Bored by the dulness of it all:
And o’er his chiv
“ ’Ave the ’ouse down about our ears
next, no doubt, with yer rubbishy steam-
mangles—breakin’ the crockery in the kit-
chen, an’ makin’ more messes for the girl to
sweep up! You give over making that
noise this 'minnit, or out you go out of my
establishment neck-an’-crop. An’ I’ll trouble
yer for week-afore-last’s board, an’ the
clean wash-basin you borrered from the
upstairs-front, if it ain’t down with yer
clo’es in th’ pawn-shop . . .!!”.
’Twas my landlady! She stood in the
doorway—adjectival, raucous and defiant:
the very incarnation of plain, unvarnished
Prose! The temptation was too much.
With one triumphant yell I seized and
swung her off her feet, and all unheeding
the plaintive cries of the inventor, flung
her head-first into the receiver, and pressed
the lever.
The Pervertosensicon roused itself to a
supreme effort. Its roaring and hooting
rose to a frenzied whir and a shrill scream;
then suddenly, with a cascade of riven
screws, type and wheels, it burst . . . and
from the ruins there stepped unhurt, my
Landlady—but changed!
Now, my friends, I live in a Hash-house
Paradise. To me every morn, as I 101 l on
my pillows of eider-down in the star bed-
room, comes the Inverted Landlady, with
delicacies- of her own cooking. Payment for
board has become an insult —I have a latch-
key—crusted port is supplied me with meals
-—a marble bath has been purchased for my
benefit, and electric light installed
True, Upsigh Doune has never forgiven
my destroyal of his weird machine. I care
not. My Landlady is a Poem!
HUGH MCKAY.
The Anatomy of Verse
Prof. Saintsbury has compressed his three-
volume History into a one-volume Manual
of English Prosody (Angus and Robertson,
65.), with a new introduction. Prosody is
to Poetry what logic is to thinking; it will
not help a man to make poetry, but it will
help a poet to correctness, and help the
reader to perceive the more delicate beauties
of vei’se.
So far the theorists have been at war
with one another over the rules, particularly
the vital one of measui’ement by feet, syl-
lables or accent. Guest, the author of a
large History of English Rhythm, was an-
noyed with some of the poets because they
had written many lines which could not be
fitted to his preconceived system. Saints-
bury has surveyed the whole procession of
English poetry down to Swinburne, together
with the works of all the prosodists, and
then derived a theory from his examination.
His theory is that English verse can best
be scanned by a system of feet —long and
short, with an allowance for substitution of
equivalent feet, and the variation of the
middle or internal pause.
Saintsbury gives the rules of his foot
system, and then applies them to English
verse from Beowulf onwards. A glossary
fully explains the jargon used in the scien-
tific examination of verse —such terms as
“anacrusis,” “enjambment,” “galliambic,”
etc. There is a good bibliography of works
relating to metre, and “a reasoned list of
poets, with special regard to their prosodic
quality and influence.” Robert Browning,
for instance, is dealt with in this fashion:
“Often described as a loose and rugged
metrist and a licentious if not criminal
rhymester. Nothing of the sort. Extraor-
dinarily bold in both capacities, and some-
times, perhaps, as usually happens in these
cases, a little too bold ; but in metre practi-
cally never, in rhyme very seldom ....
overstepping actual bounds. A great mas-
ter of broken metres, internal rhyme, heavily
equivalenced lines and all the tours de force
of English prosody.”
.This manual is very good reading for any-
one who is interested in the art of poetry,
and Saintsbury compels agreement with
his main arguments in support of a body of
doctrine—“subject not to the practically in-
variable uniformity of Science, but to the
wide variations of Art.” The '“laws” of
poetry, of course, .are derived from poetry,
and are liable to be extended or broken when
a new poet is big enough to do so.
“Pollio” informed us recently of a meet-
ing in London, at which Australian poetry
burst into Society. The way had been pre-
pared by a number of articles in such jour-
nals as United Empire and The Empire .Re-
view, and the February number of the latter
contains ■ a rambling commentary by Flor-
ence M. Burton, in which Australian poets
are served up with jam and tears. The
names of most of them are mangled—-but,
“Ivnuckleboy or Nickleby, it’ll be all the
same in a hundred years,” as Mrs. Squeers
wisely remarked. The most strangely
gifted of all our bards, who is spoken of
by admiring craftsmen as “Rare George
Reid,” is praised by Miss Burton for uphold-
ing the tradition of poetry and politics. This
glittering gem from his magnum opus, the
Exhibition Ode, adorns the tail of her ar-
ticle :
Alas, the space that shields thee from all
foreign harms,
Hides from the outer world thy most attrac-
tive charms.
Indeed in Paris but a short time back
Some of thy daughters wei - e disowned be-
cause not black.
How to dispel such ignorance has long been
felt
The hardest task with which our pati’iots
e’er dealt.
A happy inspix-ation and a bold replies—
Now let a Universal Exposition arise!

A writer in the Queensland Worker, com-
menting on the two pictures reproduced
here from Norman Lindsay’s illustrations
of “Petronius,” says that they d 6 not carry
him further away than Woolloomooloo.
“That the city of Nero had its Woolloo-
mooloo we may be sure. But it was its own,
not ours.”
No one denies the Q. Worker man’s right
to speak authoritatively of the W’loo of
to-day, but what does he know about
that of Nero’s Rome? “Mankind pro-
gresses,” said Goethe, “but man remains the
same,” and if Lindsay’s characters resemble
men and women of to-day they are there-
fore likely to resemble similar people of
the past. It is in the minor matters of the
short shirts and the long noses that change
has taken place, and Lindsay thoroughly
studied his text, the architectural and other
remains of Nero’s time, in order to get his-
torical accuracy.

Ishmael Dare: Daley’s last volume has
set me re-reading letters he wrote me when
the first was being printed. I had been
worrying him with cheerfully audacious
criticism, which he took with remarkable
good temper, even verging on humility now
and then. But he was never yielding about
his best work; I made suggestions—l am
glad I don’t remember what they were—
with regard to some re-writing of the
Hawkesbury pieces, and he wrote back:
Probably you are critically right in sug-
gesting other arrangements, but I have a
feeling that I am instinctively right.
He was.
The title of his book bothered him more
than anything else. The green pages full
of fine purple script—the color makes his
letters easy to track, but wearies the eye—
are mainly concerned with titles. One let-
ter contains nine, with a tenth in a post-
script ; a friend had sent along more, but
“they all contained the dreadful word
Eucalypt,” My own suggestion “Dreams
in Amber,” he thought pretty, but not likely
to strike the public,, so he flung out his
ten, beginning with the one finally adopted,
At Dawn and Dusk (“this isn’t very strik-
ing, either”) and ending, in the postscript,
with RabesquerOt (“too recondite for the
ordinary reader; but it might be all the
better for that, as suggestive of mystery”).
Wine and Roses, which turns up in another
letter, was, I think, his favorite:
It gives a suggestion of color. Too arro-
gant, perhaps? Anyhow, it is the best I
can imagine. A number of my literary and
professional friends here admire it.
It was at first proposed to have his por-
trait as a frontispiece, but he fought against
that. “In such a place,\ he wrote, “it
seems to me like a sort of patent medicine
advertisement, which should be accompanied
by the legend:

“ I have benefited much by your medicine, principally in Africa
where it was first given to me by an Australian, after a severe attack of
malarial fever. I was taken tq Nairobi, the centre of Govt, in British
E. Africa, in a state of collapse. The greatest care had to be taken
during my convalescence.
“My Australian friend gave me three bottles. It improved my
appetite, creating desire for food, the beginning of a general restoration
to health, transforming a condition of extreme debility to one of
splendid strength.
“ I was so impressed with the medicine that I recommended it to
my brother officers. I have cause to be very grateful to this excellent
medicine, and, as I am now in Sydney, I am only fulfilling a duty in
testifying to its worth. You may use this letter as you like.”

SECRETS.
E are here to tell your beautiful-faced
women that faces do not attract so
readily as does figure, and we will
gladly tell any woman who writes us the
secret of how many hostesses and actresses
develop their busts and fill out the hollows of
their cheeks.
The hollow-necked, scrawny-armed and
flat-chested woman is always at a great dis-
advantage, socially, with her full-bosomed,
well-developed associates. She who is most
fully-developed always monopolises the
endearments of the opposite sex, and is a
source of envy to her ill-developed sisters.
If you are flat and hollow-chested, without
bosom, and suffer from attenuation, we will tell
you, free of charge, how you may develop
your bust and figure to pleasing proportions.
Thousands of women in similar health have
accepted and followed this advice, and are to-
day, as the result, radiant in the enjoyment of
good health, a pleasing, fully-developed figure,
and a plump, well-rounded bosom.
Attenuated women who have for years suf-
fered the ravages of indigestion, constipation,
biliousness, internal functional disorders, and
various other troubles are numbered in this
category.
We suggest that all lady readers who see this
article will do well to investigate the truth of these
assertions. Send 2d. stamp, and we will post you
full particulars and a Free Sample of Treatment.

MOST MEN would cure themselves of
the Tobacco habit if they knew they
could do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the bqats of the heart. Tokeep it
up is to tempt death by Heart Disease,
Nervous Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and
Stomach, Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless,
vegetable remedy that will make the user
of tobacco in any form absolutely abandon
the habit for good. It not only destroys
the craving, the desire, the appetite for
tobacco, but restores to health the entire
nervous system, and aids nature in entirely
eliminating from the system the Nicotine
Poison.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Work of the Wharves.
The ships are sunk and the crews are lost, and ever
the news is heard
Of this ship “Missing,” of that one “Wrecked,” of
the other “Still no word.”
But the Work of the World can’t wait for these—
the Factory, Loom and Mill,
So the wharves are never idle, and the derricks are
never still.
Along the wharves the liners lie—the long sheds fill
Fill arid "empty—swept to-day, and crammed again
to-night. , . ,
While clattering donkey-engine and clanking der-
rick-chain , .
Toil fiercely on through day and dusk, and glaring
arc-lamp’s light. . ~
Dust and heat and sunshine; wind and cold
and rain— , , . . .
They don’t count; hook on and hoist away.
Rush and clash and clamor; ceaseless stress
and strain,
So the wharves work on from day to day.
The men that drive the tunnel, fall the bush and
hold the plough,
The men that yard the scrubbers and the men
that shear the sheep,
Are all at work to send the stuff the wharves must
handle now,
To keep the winches screaming and the steamers
loading deep.
Lead and wheat and timber; meat and hides
and wool,
Sling ’em in and stow ’em down below.
Slack away your hawsers, as soon ’s your holds
are full.
“All clear aft!” so hurry up and go!
With crews half dead from work and wet and want
of food and sleep, ...
The sailing ships beat slowly in and reach the
And threshing up from leeward, with her schedule
time to keep, . , ._ j
The steamer runs her beaten route, through wind
or sea or tide. ,
Through toil and death and danger; through
, the risks they always run,
Above, and on, and underneath the seas,
Through blizzard, fog and ice-pack, or the
Tropics’ savage sun,
They come to drop their cargoes on our
quays.
A dainty Island schooner in the tideway gently
(Oh, the creaming surf along the reef; the still
lagoon within!) ,
And an ugly box-built cargo tramp, straight out o
London docks. ,
(Black oily water, smoky skies, and traffic s
1 vibrant din !)
Copra from the Coral Isles, boilers out o Brum,
All that earth can grow or man can make
Is cargo for the carriers that straight and
swiftly come.
To pile the wharves with all we give and
take.
A cargo swung aboard, perhaps, from a tossing
Kroo canoe
(Hushed Hinterland and roaring beach; long
days and fevered nights),
Or a lonely little jetty in the fjord still and blue.
(The sweet pine- scent, the clear, chill air and
flickering Northern Lights.)
From port and pier aaid roadstead ; from beach
and river-mouth
Across the way, or o’er the world so wide,
From the Humber or the Hooghli; from East,
West, North or South,
They’re coming in along our waterside.
Every nation’s speech, and oaths of all the seas
between,
Men of every color, creed and country, town and
g£ a £g
Who know the far-set cities as a boy his village-
green,
And a hundred harbors better than their own
front garden gate.
Dutchmen, Don and Dagp, coolie and Chm-ee,
Jews and Cockneys, Conways spruce and
neat —
The World’s Wide-Open Doorway is set along
obr quay,
And our string-piece is the Doorstep to its
feet.
A statesman fails, or an Empire falls, and ever the
swift word flies
. Of a nation’s might, of an army’s fight, of a king
who is crowned —or dies.
But the roaring looms tare still to feed, and the
hungry mouths to fill,
So the wharves are nevc.r idle and the derricks are
never still.

When We Are One.
When we are one, and in One Being lave,
For what desire’s fulfilment shall We crave ?
Is there for such an One in Being’s plan
Another mate like woman is to man ?
Or what shall be the poles of our desires?
An unimagined sex in astral fires ?
Or merely glow and .heat and joy and pan ,
Female and male, tlieir dramas o’er again?
Shall syjiphic fervors rise from passion’s mud?
Or oeld 1 angelic flames, transformed to blood,
Course through the ,veins our duplex form will
hold,
And warmer sylphs sir fairer mortals mould ?
Which shall We be, "the seeker or the sought,
The man, the maid, the hunter or the caught?
Shall We allure strong Him, for whom We sigh
With feigned retreat, with liquid lighted eye,
With pillowing curve, with soft adornment’s toil,
With lens-like robe* t*> magnify the spoil?
Pluck from some Phoenix plumes to make Our hair
A flame of love for moth-wings fluttering there?
Or shall we sight im Home star-cluster Her,
In skins arrayed or elfin gossamer,
And glow through all Our being when She flies,
And, stumbling over worlds, o’ertake Our prize,
As happy from the ra«.:e as if ’twere run
Here, long ago, ere :man and maid were One ?

SCIENTIFIC GLEANINGS=Liver Pill Talks
No. 1.
What every woman wants.
It is no use being well gowned if you have a blotchy
complexion.
A hobble skirt will not hide a pimple on your nose.
A pimple takes away your self-respect.
The being has to be born who can be dignified and
at the same time harbor a pimple.
Your pleasure is gone because you are thinking
about it all the time. You take surreptitious peeps into
mirrors.
You are wondering when it is going to burst.
It is Nature’s signal that your blood is out of order.
A course of FISHER’S BEAUTY PILLS for the Liver,
which will cost you a shilling, will remove the pimple,
and prevent others coming.
Don’t be afraid because the price is so small; they
don’t cost much money, but they do a power of good.
Give them a trial ; they go to the root of the trouble.
No. 2.
Bad blood saps your store of energy.
You need all your energy.
Your success in life depends upon it.
if you go into your office jaded and out of tone you
are a passenger. Someone else has to carry you.
You put in all your time watching the clock.
Clock watchers in an, age of competition, where
profits are fined down, are parasites. Parasites in the
long run get just what they deserve.
It is nothing to the employer that you are out of
sorts. He sees the effect. The cause is not his busi-
ness. But it is yours.
Take a course of FISHER’S BEAUTY PILLS for the
Liver; they make the blood run bright red.
They kill impurities in the blood by so gentle a pro-
cess that you don’t notice it. You only know that you
are another man.
Try them ; they go to the root of the trouble.
No. 3.
Is the previous night worth the next morning ?
You had a good time last night, but you are off-color
this morning, because you drank too much.
You have a tongue like the bottom of a bird-cage,
and you make only a pretence of eating the breakfast
chop.
You have already drunk the contents of the water
jug, and you still wish your tea-cup was a dipper—
you wouldn’t have to pass it down to the other end of
the table so often then.
You wish you hadn’t met Brown last night. Brown,
with his “Just another, old chap,” is responsible for
your trouble this morning.
But you will be always meeting Brown, so when you
are going to bed take a dose of FISHER’S BEAUTY
PILLS for the Liver.
in the morning you will have no “ head,” no bird-
cage tongue, a good appetite, and you will be able to
look your wife clear in the eye.
Give them a trial. They cost the price of two drinks,
and we will not ask you for a testimonial. Just tell
Brown and the others.

Beautiful, Clear Complexion and Healthy Liver Regained in One Week.
MISS B. BROWN’S RELIABLE TESTIMONY.
For some three or four months I suffered very badly from what I believe was an inactive liver. On and off I had a dull pain between
the shoulders. In the daytime I felt heavy and drowsy, whilst at night I was restless and wakeful. About every fortnight I had a bilious
attack, with severe sick headaches, when I couldn’t so much as look at my food. Often after meals my food would seem to stick in my chest
in a hard lump, giving me great pain, and causing wind ; indeed, I felt sick after almost every meal. Sometimes a sort of blackness would
come before my eyes, and a kind of dizziness \ r ould seize me, and I would be compelled to lie down. In the morning my tongue was furred
and discolored, and I felt dead tired the moment I got out of bed. My eyes, people said, looked.dull and heavy, my complexion became sallow
and sickly-looking, and, worse than all, a large number of pimples made their appearance all over my face. So unsightly were these erup-
tions that I d.dn’t care to go. out, except at night-time. People recommended different things, such as Epsom Salts, Seidlitz powders, claret,
and various well-known tonics. I tried these things, but found no improvement in my condition, and when a friend got me to take “Fisher’s
Beauty Pills for the Liver,” I didn’t expect anything worth mentioning. I was mistaken, however, for a dozen of these pills made quite a dif-
ference. I didn’t feel bilious or heavy any more, and I lost the headache and the pain in the back, and slept well. I took some more
BEAUTY PILLS for the Liver, and one morning (about a week after starting the pills) woke to find the pimples disappearing. In two days
more my complexion and my eyes were perfectly bright and clear, as they always are when I am in good health. Before the bottle
of BEAUTY PILLS was finished I was in perfect health, and felt as lively and cheerful as ever I did in my life.
I make this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to be true.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be re-
fused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the
publishers. The right to reproduce or translate any
part of the contents of this number is hereby ex-
pressly reserved by the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read and, where prac-
ticable, acknowledge in the “Correspondence” col-
umn all contributions submitted, whether in the
form of Political, Social or other Articles, Verse,
Short Tales or Sketches (those dealing with Aus-
tralian subjects, and not exceeding two columns in
length, or, say, 3000 words, are specially accept-
able), Paragraphs, Letters or Newspaper Clippings.
All communications will be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
The Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS.
when the address is specified and stamps are en-
closed. But no MS. will be returned, or preserved,
unless these conditions are observed. When MS. is

THE CONFLICTING VOICES AND WHAT
THEY SUGGEST.
The Referenda campaign is unique among
political fights in one respect. Nearly all
the opponents of the enlarged powers asked
for by the National Government claim to be
in favor of some of them —while many ap-
prove of most of them. It is thus pos-
sible, in any Tory gathering, to strike an
elector who is enthusiastic about the New
Protection, another who believes in railway
employees having a right of appeal to the
Federal Arbitration Court, and another who
goes bald-headed for Commonwealth control
of monopolies. Yet all of them, for one
vague, muddled reason or another, are dog-
gedly resolved to vote “No, No,” on April 26.
* * * *
It is natural, when one comes to study it.
Mankind is utterly selfish in the mass. When
factory legislation w r as first mooted, there
were thousands of right-thinking people
who, as a matter of principle, simply loathed
the idea of working-women being sweated
amid insanitary surroundings. But, for all
that, they opposed the specific laws which
were designed to bring relief to these unfor-
tunates. They had their bank accounts to
consider: and so they fought the Factory
Acts like well-nourished tigers, damning
them as flagrant samples of red-flag Social-
ism. and as manifestations that Private En-
terprise was doomed, and that the country
was careering down a steep place to ruin.
But the bulk of the population was not per-
sonally and financially concerned in the
sweating trade, so the protesters went down,
and the Factory Acts became law.
* * * *
Much the same thing is occurring in con-
nection with the Referenda proposals.
Hordes of Anti-Laborites approve warmly of
the New Protection. They may be identified
any day, with their halos adjusted, and the
garb of self-righteousness enwrapping them,
smugly denouncing a state of things under
which the manufacturer is able to reap the
full financial benefits of the tariff, and con-
tinue to pay his workmen on a Freetrade
wage-basis. N. S. Wales foreign-traders,
for example, are as clamantly in favor of
the New Protection as any Laborite. Ex-
Minister Garland and Ex-Hero Wade give
it an encouraging word every time they
orate. The reason is that the prosperous
suburban parts of Sydney—which, in the
eyes of our Wades and Garlands, connote
the Commonwealth of Australia —aren’t in-
habited to any great extent by manufac-
turers ; and so the representatives of these
centres can afford to be frank about at least
the New Protection feature of the “Social-
ists’ ” policy.
* ■» * *
Very different is the attitude of the Mel-
bourne Age, and the folks who support it.
The Age, to-day, is the Victorian manufac-
turers’ organ, and little else. The thought
of New Protection, an arrangement under
which its chief patrons would be forced, in
every case, to pay decent wages, or go out
of the highly-Proteeted manufacturing busi-
ness, afflicts the Age with a cold sweat. It
can stand a number of the amendments pro-
posed by the Australian Government, but the
reflection that, with them, it must swallow
the New Protection horror, causes it to
revolt at the lot. Here is the Age point
of view, as expressed in a recent leader: —
If each question had been put separately some
would, very possibly, have been carried by a large
majority, it is certain that others would have been
overwhelmingly negatived. Mr. Hughes saw this,
and he acted accordingly. In the Industrial Refer-
endum, therefore, he included a proposal that the
Federation should have supreme power to deal with
combinations, trusts and monopolies. ' . . . The
reason is obvious. Mr. Hughes effected this to in-
fuse a spurious species of popularity into the In-
dustrial Referendum, and to prevent those who want
the Federation to have full power over monopolies
and trusts from'- gaining their desire except by simul-
taneously voting “Yes” to three other questions,
which threaten to smash the Constitution in frag-
ments.
So, on tlie Sydney side, we have the
Wades and Garlands, and other “No-
Noes” saying that Isew Protection is a first-
rate thing, and it ij only the proposal to
deal with monopolies that is bad ; while on
the Melbourne side we have the Age de-
nouncing the New Protection as an abomin-
able thing, and declaring that it is only the
proposal to deal with monopolies that, is
good. The Sydney “No-Noes,” in the first
place, deny that Australia possesses any-
thing resembling an oppressive combine, or
other such conspiracy. The possibility of
a Meat or other Trust being formed here on
Yankee lines, they declare to be a bogey,
fabricated by brilliant special pleaders of the
B. R. Wise stamp. The Coal Trust is
limned as a benevolent concern, which would
not exploit the public, even if it had an
army to back its manipulations. The ab-
surdly affluent, and none the less predatory,
Gas, Ferry and Sugar monopolies are re-
presented as honest, hard-working concerns,
which are only reaping the legitimate fruits
of their business skill and foresight. It
is claimed that they should not be legislat-
ively interfered with, no matter how their
dividends rise, or how much the people pay,
in consequence, for the necessaries of life.
These people are quite in favor of interfering
with the manufacturer —because in Sydney
he is scarce, and not very powerful—but
they are quite opposed to interfering with
the monopolist, because in N.S.W. Anti-
Sosh, which is Liberalism, which is State
Frightism, is largely interested in coal,
sugar, ferries and gas. If the Victorian
Anti-Laborite, whose sentiments are voiced
by the Age, were personally concerned to
any extent in an Australian monopoly, his
attitude to the monopolies section of the Re-
ferenda questions would, for a certainty, be
just the same as that of N.S.W. “Liberal-
ism.” But he isn’t. When a Melbourne
Age writer or reader speaks of “trusts and
monopolies,” he only means one thing—
the Melbourne Metropolitan Gas Company.
And to the Age and to AGE-ites the Mel-
bourne Gas Co. is Swinburne ; and any-
thing connected with Swinburne merits
every fragment of trouble that is going.
There is a useful lesson in all this. The
leit-motiv of every Tory electioneering howl
in the past, has been —“The Labor policy
is rotten to the core, and there is no justice'
or sanity in it.” In the present campaign,
however, Toryism doesn’t pretend that the
proposals of Labor are iniquitous, and crude,
and anarchical, and generally impossible.
Speaking in a weirdly divided tone of voice,
Toryism alleges, in fact, that most of the
amendments asked for are perfectly sound
and reasonable. But Adipose, M.L.C., who
has a factory somewhere in Victoria, reckons
it is criminal folly for the Australian Govern-
ment to seek power to pass laws which must
mulct him in increased wages, and Fatte,
of Sydney, whose Gas shares return him an
inordinate dividend, considers the possibility
of cheap gas an outrage, and the beginning
of the end. In other words, even chronic
Anti-Laborites, in a large number of cases,
only claim that the Government is asking
for too much where it asks for powers which
may be used to the detriment of their par-
ticular vested interests. It is a novel situ-
ation, which should make those electors who
are unbiassed by any vested interest think
hard, and act accordingly.
A MINISTER CHANGES HORSES ON
THE BRINK OF THE CORONATION.
Just before hurrying aboard the vessel
which took him to the Coronation, Defence
Minister Pearce rearranged the duties of the
Military Board. Henceforward Colonel
Wallack, the Adjutant-General, will ad-
minister the Universal Training Scheme, in
place of Lieut.-Colonel Legge, the Quarter-
master-General, who has had charge of it
hitherto. Legge will draw up the uncom-
pleted portion of the regulations referring to
adult training, and then turn to other
work. Beyond remarking vaguely that the
new ukase “appears to make the Minister s
power absolute,” the daily papers see little
significance in it. As a matter of tact, it
not only contains that possibility, but others
considerably more dangerous.
* * * *
Under the absurd party system of govern-
ment which Australia adopted from England
when it was too young to know better, the
great offices of State are mostly held by Min-
isters who have no knowledge whatever of
the technicalities of their departments. That
is how it becomes possible for a King
O’Malley to be Minister for Home Affairs,
and a Joe Cook to be Minister for Defence.
Senator Pearce is, by general consent, the
ablest Defence Minister the Commonwealth
has known. But he was brought up to be
a carpenter, and instruction in the intricacies
of the art or game of War is no part of the
curriculum in the carpentering trade. Hence
the value to him of a Military Board of ex-
perts. So long as the existing system of
government prevails, it is desirable that the
Minister should appreciate his limitations,
and lean on his knowledgable advisers. And
that being so, it follows that the advisers
should be the best available.
The question arises: Is Colonel Wallace;
the best man available to help the Defence
Minister to lick Australia’s embryo army in-
to shape ? In other words: Is he more
likely to be a success at the job than the
man he has displaced? The soundest test
lies in a contrast between Legge’s record
and that of his successor. Legge has been
a battler for the compulsory-service principle
since the days when to mention such
a subject in club, importing, legal, or
other allegedly-polite circles, meant the
stirring up of curses. and the un-
loosing of a flood of wild talk about “dis-
loyalty to the Empire,” “white slavery,”
“un-English practices,” and so on. As pub-
lic opinion grew more educated, successive
Governments started to sit up and take
notice of the “Conscriptionists’ ” sug-
gestions. Universal service schemes were
called for. Legge formulated every one of
them, from the first, which was supplied to
the Deaicin Government when Ewing was
Defence Minister, to that which was under
consideration when Kitchener arrived
here. The only important detail in which the
Kitchener scheme, as finally adopted, dif-
fered from the Legge scheme, consisted in
raising the age at which adult training ended
from 20 to 25. As to Legge’s universal
service administration, the Minister for De-
fence had this to say in Melbourne when he
announced the reconstruction of the Board :
He recognises the valuable and self-sacrificing
work that has been done by Colonel Leoge as direc-
tor of operations. In giving effect to the change, he
wishes it to be distinctly recognised that he is
animated by no lack either of appreciation or of con-
fidence in that officer or his work. On account of
his past duties, Colonel Legge must necessarily, he
recognises, be more in touch with the intentions of
the Government as to the details of the scheme than
any other officer, and he feels sure that the various
members of the Board, who will be called upon to
carry out the duties belonging to their particular
branch, will be able at all times to rely upon his
advice and. assistance.
#*.'**
Colonel Wallack is an ex-Militia man
(Middlesex Regiment), who was appointed
Adjutant of the Forces in Tasmania shortly
after he arrived there from England.
Such enthusiasm as he possesses for the com-
pulsory service idea, is of recent growth.
And he has made no particular punch as an
administrator. Why should the admittedly
capable Legge be ousted from an office for
which, as the result of a lifetime’s experi-
ence, he is peculiarly fitted, in order to
make room for a more or less unknown quan-
tity? The answer is bound up mysteriously
in the “Minister’s absolute power” above-
mentioned, in Inspector-General Kirk-
patrick, in the genial pliability of Colonel
Wallack, and other things.
* * * *
No one questions the ability of Inspector-
General Kirkpatrick. His is probably
as active, hard-working and capable
an officer as Australia could have imported
to inspect the administration of its forces.
The trouble is, he is not content to inspect.
He yearns with the intense yearning of the
self-confident, energetic and ambitious man
to direct as well. For months it has been
understood in Victorian military circles that
Defence Minister Pearce had a “ghost”;
and there was a suspicion that the spectre
was Kirkpatrick. The recommendations of
the Military Board have been repeatedly
overridden. Thus the recent reduction in
the retiring age of officers —a policy which
is reasonable enough in the United Kingdom,
where there are plenty of senior officers, but
which has few points in Australia, where
senior officers are painfully scarce —was done
in the teeth of the Board’s opposition. The
Minister has been betraying a knowledge of
military details which has astounded his
intimates. The reasonable assumption is that,
though the voice was the voice of Pearce,
the hand that pulled the wires was connected
with the body of Kirkpatrick.
* * * *
If, as is pretty certain, the Defence Minis-
ter’s parting act was inspired by the Inspec-
tor-General, the position has some serious
aspects so far as Australia is concerned,
The completes! sympathy is known to exist
between the Inspector-General and Colonel
Wallack. Wallack is not what is known
as “a strong man.” Kirkpatrick is. In
other words, Colonel Wallack’B universal-
training administration will probably be, to
all intents and purposes, the Inspector-Gen-
eral’s administration. An official may be
an invaluable figure at the helm in England,
India, or wherever else he happens to : have
special knowledge, and yet be the very reverse
in a country whose local conditions, senti-
ments, conventions and views are strange to
him. The Inspector-General, who, by the
present look of things, will stand behind
Colonel Wallack, as masteriully as he has
recently been standing behind the Minister
who appointed Colonel Wallack to his
present position, has in the nature of
things little sympathy or acquaint-
ance with the Australian attitude.
He is gifted with the highest qualifications
to act generally as critic, adviser, in-
structor. or what not to the Australian
forces, inasmuch as they are modelled on
the British plan, and in Britain the Inspec-
tor-General is recognised as one who knows
his job. But when it comes to taking a
hand, directly or indirectly, in details of ad-
ministration, he is as likely as any other
comparatively recent importation to hash
things up.
A couple of instances will suffice. In or-
der to successfully carry out the junior por-
tion of the training, the co-operation of the
State Educational departments and the
teachers needs to be obtained. In mam-
cases, owing to the violent State Frights
prejudices that have been fomented for poli-
tical purposes by “Liberalism,” there is an
unwillingness on the part of the Educational
authorities to help the Federal Government
in any way whatever. That is only going to
be overcome by diplomacy, backed by know-
ledge of the representations that are most
likely to be effective with obstructionists, in-
differentists and others. It is a task at
which the brightest of oversea soldiers might
be expected to fail. On July 12, 1912, the
first lot of senior cadets is due to pass into
the adult forces. That is to say, in a year’s
time, 20,000 ex-cadets are to amalgamate
with the existing 25,000 militia —a process
which is to continue yearly till the 120,000
total recommended by Kitchener is reached.
It is evident that the initial difficulties of
this undertaking must be enormous. Not
only has an army of boys to be grafted on
to an army of men, but the breaking up of
many old units, and the creation of new r
ones, and the severing of all sorts of regi-
mental ties must be accomplished at the
same time, and without undue friction. Local
sentiment and prejudices, and personal and
regimental resentments and jealousies, will
need to be placated, or there will be trouble.
It is a job, if ever there was one, for an offi-
cer who has lived his life among the people
concerned.
Even if there were no delicate situation
inseparable from the institution of a
compulsory-service scheme in a country
like Australia, it would still be de-
sirable to lay down the principle at
the very beginning o 2 things that no In-
spector-General, howevifc: distinguished, shall
be suffered to take a hand in administrative
work. It is not his province. And though,
at times, his interference might prove useful,
yet there are circumstances, as in the case
under discussion, where it might easily be
disastrous. The importation of an incom-
petent Inspector-General is conceivable;
with precedents to support him in directing
matters outside his own sphere, he could
bring infinite trouble on the country.
THE REBELLION.
Randolph Bedford speaks a piece
A heavy range sloped to the sea —a great avenue
of eucalypts growing wondrously, and in contempt
of the fact that they were 10,000 miles from Aus-
tralia, the country of their origin. They half hid'
the wrecked mine buildings of the Argentella, or, as
it is called by the Corsican, Caprice d’lnglisi—“the
madness of the English”—by reason of a quarter Of
a million of London money having been spent to
equip a “mine” which yielded 100 tons or so of
galena, and no more. And here in Corsica grew the
eucalypts, tenacious of their Australian habit, and
flowering triumphantly in the winter they refused to
recognise. Here, within 20 miles of Calvi, one of
the birth-places of Christopher Columbus, and
10,000 miles from mine own land, I found a proof
that the rebellion which is to come is founded on
natural facts as much as on a growing national sen-
timent.
The weaker plants of the Northern Hemisphere
have no such strength or obstinacy. The wheat
must follow climate. January ends the harvest
of Australia. Egypt reaps in March; Syria,
Mexico and Persia in April ; Central Asia, Morocco,
China and Japan in May; California, Spain, Sicily
and Southern Europe reap in June; England, Ne-
braska and Northern Europe in July; Manitoba,
Holland, Denmark and Russia in August; the islands
of the North Sea in September; and so on. And
the fruits of the whole world come to us in our
summer, taking the line of least resistance, and just
strong enough to be adaptable. But the Australian
trees bloom on, and the Australian black swan breed
in their Australian season when transported to
cold, dark England, or the more temperate
Tyrrhenian sea. It can be cold in Cor-
sica as in Norway—yet there I saw the crim-
son-flowered gum putting forth his flame of bloom,
defying the tramontana that blew chillingly off the
hills of snow. And in Regent’s Park, London,
the black swan nests and broods in the winter. In
Australia this is not true of the imported oak. In
the Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne, every .successive
winter finds the oak postponing the falling of the
leaf; assimilating itself to the Australian habit;
becoming gradually evergreen; holding its last
year’s half-dead leaves until it is almost ready for
breaking into the new.
Southern environment is strong enough to alter
types always for the better, improvingly. The red
deer in Maoriland, the rabbit in Australia, are
bigger and finer and more productive than in Scot-
land or England. Queenslanders know how com-
mon and authenticated the story that station horses
in the “boiling down” days fattened on the lean
meat in the tips; Maorilanders say that the horse
which draws the oyster trucks at the Bluff eats his
dozen or two whenever he can get them, although
he does not like them on the shell.
» * * *
Australia is the hardest, kindest, cruellest, and
most beneficent country of the earth. The real
Australian —not the little Australian-born person of
the cities —is the best type of man on earth, be-
cause he survives its recurrent and brutal unkind-
nesses. At the cost of a few million years of ex-
periment, Australia has produced the Flinders and
Mitchell grasses of the great rolling downs of Cen-
tral and Nor’-West Queensland— grasses which ma-
ture in the dry time into a self-made hay, which an
inch of rain at the wrong time will blacken and
rot. The geranium fodder-plant of Central Aus-
tralia has a seed shaped like an Archimidean screw;
when the country becomes a dust-heap, the winds
screw the seed home to wait for the rains in a re-
gion where 6in. and no more is the annual average.
On the plains the melon vine and the cucumber
dry and blow to dust, the soil cracks like slaking
lime, and the seeds fall into security to await their
season.
The great Australian quality is resilience. As the
country is, so are the real men of it capable of en-
durance to the verge of collapse, and then recovering
without effort. At 10 or 11 year intervals a four
years drought sweeps the continent. For scores
of thousands of square miles the country becomes
a vast dust-heap, whose poverty evicts even the
crows and the “gohannas.” And at the moment
when the land seems to be condemned, with the
death-warrant on its way to delivery, up comes the
brave south wind, with its wings dripping water,
and down from the north sweeps the depression of
the monsoon. An inch of rain consolidates the dust,
another inch makes mud; and although the drought-
smitten cattle have dug up all the grass roots, and
all seeds have apparently perished, yet oyer
the earth a sickly greenness springs with the third
shower. A few weeks later the dust-heap is a mea-
dow, a garden, a great and gracious park, and the


store cattle which have been hurriedly trucked back
from the crowded relief country wallow in luxury
until the yellow fat spreads over their ribs and casts
them for death. And all forms of life rush to re-
populate the new world —bird, butterfly, insect and
animal—everywhere, more than in any other coun-
try, the boundless egotism of self-preservation and
the colossal conceit of reproduction.
And this is a country that teaches its struggling
life new ways to live. The rifle fish earns his living
by the accuracy of his aim in shooting a grasshopper
with a drop of water, so stunning the prey and
bringing it within reach; the seed of =pear-grass is
taught to lie quietly in the dust in the dry time,
and to spring into energy of real movement, which
might almost be termed muscular action, as soon
as it is moistened —a fact which accounts for the
death of many sheep, whose wool-yolk moistens the
grass seed, and keeps it moving; and the ceratodus
fish on occasion climbs trees. Australia has taught
the Australian new ways, too, although he clings
slavishly to many superstitions utterly foreign to
the conditions of this country. Regard them —these
dull agricultural “pioneers.” Unable to see the wondrous
beauty of their new land, they imported gorse and
sweetbriar, to make it look like the old little patch-
work quilt country they had left, and so ruined
a few million acres in New South Wales; some
other homesick idiot introduced the prickly pear;
and yet other imbeciles brought the rabbit and
the thistle, and the sparrow, and the starling, and
the fox.
But, worse than any weed or vermin the nostalgia
of the thick-headed Englishman brought to Australia,
are their superstitions, which make the Australian
Sunday drearier than the Sunday of Glasgow; their
traditions, which retard the growth of an Australian
national sentiment; their stodginess in politics, lit-
erature or art. Their habits of living become farci-
cal when applied to Australian conditions. The
reason why the English like “Robbery Under Arms,”
and call it the “finest Australian novel,” is because
it is not Australian, but English. Boldrewood
never had the Australian outlook, never could think
Australianly. His British township is the English village
with the name of Boobybingie, instead of Gobbleham-
bury; his bushranger is left pulling his forelock to a
transplanted “squire.” Regard them—the dull, daily
papers that fatten on our pennies. Regard them —
many of our politicians: the men with never a word
for Australia, but only interminable gush for “Em-
pire” ; the shoddy seekers after foreign titles —pre-
pared to sell the best interests of their country at any
moment for the Windsor equivalent of the savages’
hoop-iron and three beads; the small sub-municipal
intelligences, which approach the, consideration of
national issues with the broad statesmanship of a
pound-keeper.
* * * *
It has long been the habit to believe that England
gave us our free institutions. The belief is false.
The English and Scotch and Irish who had come to
Australia, and who were aided by Americans and
Frenchmen and Italians and all the cream of the ad-
venturous men of the earth, did that; we had to
have a Eureka before fat-headed English officialism
saw that it had to deal with men who were better
than the men who governed them. To abolish eon-
victism in Australia, Australians had to turn back
a few shiploads of felonry that sought to be de-
barked at Sydney Cove. The superstition of Eng-
lish Government allowed us to sit quietly while
Derby in Downing-street disallowed Mcllwraith’s
annexation of New Guinea for Australia, and left the
Nor’-Western Pacific open to Germany. Yet it was
a beneficent stupidity; better the white German
than any piebald ally of England and natural foe of
Australia.
It is against the worship of imported habit and
belief that the Australian must rebel, as he rebels
against a fiscal system which makes him a digger
up and a shearer of raw material, a wood and water
joey for the manufacturing artisans of the earth.
Sectarianism —dead as a political force in the Old
World —fluorished like the rabbit under the condi-
tions of the new land, and for a time almost abso-
lutely banished political things out of politics. The
foolish habit of wearing North Pole clothing in an
Australian summer, of eating great masses of beef
and heavy pudding on Christmas Day, because the
Saxons did so to keep out the December cold —all
these things must we rebel against, and quickly
and decisively.
The Australian Sabbath is as dreary as the Sab-
bath at Stirling—where a Scotchman one Sunday led
me enthusiastically to the cemetery to be amused
and uplifted by rain and sleet falling on the graves.
The people own the libraries and art galleries, yet
for 20 years the great majority of the owners were
unable to see their own property on their one day
of leisure. A wave of cant has swept across the
Southern States, and slandering pulpiteers have fallen
again into their native obscurity; but only by reason
of the fact that they went too far. Indiscriminate,
ill-regulated gambling is an evil just as much as
drunkenness; but the only thing to be done with
gambling is to regulate it by State-owned totalisa-
tors; just as drunkenness is in part curable by pen-
alising the adulterators of liquor. But these drunken
teetotalers sodden with uncharitableness must
have the opposite effect to that they allege they
seek; although, apparently, they seek really that
audience which they cannot get by staying in their
churches. As a result the Southern States are dis-
figured with little associations of Pharisees —hypo-
critical busybodies, with a double component of
malice to fill in the place that in the ordinary
human is filled with tolerance. That kind of “good
man,” who is made of two buckets of sawdust and
a bucket of water, some envy, and a few tracts, is
very common in Australia. He cannot, unfortu-
nately, be deported; so the rebellion against the
minority he represents must be speedy and thorough.
* * * *
One of these killjoy organisations some time ago
proposed as a recommendation from its Purity
Department,” that the publication and exhibition of
picture studies in the nude, or of statues, should be
prohibited, as they were “generally from models of
our fallen sisters, and were a source of danger to
the young.” In a country that is destined by its
climate and its sunlight to produce people of Latin
temperament, in a country that must sing and must
write verse, and must paint and make statues,
simply because the joy of life is strong and craves
expression in one or other of these forms, the dirty,
Puritanical sentimentalism of the mid-Victorian
times should surely find no place. And yet it does.
The superstition of the indecency of the decent
human body is as usual in Australia as is that
horror for sitting down upon the mahoganv-framed,
horsehair-seated chair and the room that it lives in;
with the antimacassars which belong to the time when
men wore ringlets and cocoanut hair oil —with the
fat mahogany table, supported by one central and
swollen leg, and covered with a black and red table-
cloth and decorated with a mat of many-colored
wools; and thereupon seven pounds weight of the
AVor'd, brass-bound, and never opened.
It is the dull traditions of the Old World, the
superstition of the imported article and belief; the
attempts at perpetuation of the ridiculous social
castes, of the English village; the stodgy cookery
and the foolish black clothing and squeakful boots
of the British Methody, the dour Calvinism of Pais-
lev and Lancashire, and the cruel parochialism of the
Cornishman that prevent a triumphant national sen-
timent. A moment of national danger would give
the national sentiment a victory, but we cannot wait
for war or invasion, because Australia the best
country on earth—should be made the best country
on earth to live in without the unnecessary loss of a
da Let us rebel! The Australian has allowed himself
to be mastered by minorities, because he is not good
citizen enough to use the power he has. To make
Australia a land where wine may be drunk under
trees .and to the sound of music, instead of a place
where wine is mostly whisky, to be consumed in a
cellar, and music in a licensed house is an offence
under the Act ; to make Australia a place that re-
spects the good citizen who loves Australia, and re-
fuses to be legislated for by dreary men who bleat
“Empire,” it is only necessary to use, for the pur-
pose of making laws and moulding that public
opinion which is greater than all law, a little of
that energy in the duties of citizenship which the
average Australian of the cities puts into cricket or
the chase of the Cup winner. If he wishes to make
Australia a place of gladness, and music, and com-
fort and beauty—a place that knows no more the
Japophile, and the Anglo-maniac, and the Calvinist,
and the general crank, as noisy minorities pre-
tending to be majorities—let him make up his
mind in the matter and the thing is done.
From stupid conditions, only tolerated be-
cause they had their origin in the Old World, to
ways of life which mean the beauty, the joys and
the praise of life is not a long step—only a decisive
one. So let us rebel, decisively, this week.

A New Cure for a Broken Leg.
Accokding to the agenda paper for the re-
cent conference of the Associated Chambers
of Manufactures, the objects of the associa-
tion include the following :
To endeavor to secure, by conference or otherwise,
uniformity of laws and customs respecting or af-
fecting manufacture and production in the various
States.
The association has been in existence since
1903, and seven conferences have been held ;
but so far as securing “uniformity of laws
and customs respecting or affecting manu-
facture and production” is concerned, the re-
sults have been absolutely nil. It is obvious
that “conference” is useless to effect the de-
sired change, so it becomes necessary for
the Associated Chambers to push on with
“otherwise” methods. As the only method
in sight is offered by the Referenda, it might
have been thought that the conference would
have passed an enthusiastic resolution, re-
commending all manufactures to vote “Yes”
on April 26. Instead of doing so, how-
ever, the delegates made it apparent to
Hughes, M.H.R., who addressed them on the
subject, that he was dealing with a hostile
audience, and afterwards they carried the
following motion: —
That in the opinion of this Conference it is in
the interests of Australia that the electors of the
Commonwealth should vote “NO” to the questions
to be submitted in the Referenda in April next.
The fertile genius of the South Australian
Chamber was responsible for tabling this
motion, and the position of that body re-
quires a heap of explanation. A few
months ago there were bitter complaints on
the part of implement and machinery manu-
facturers of the central State that they were
unable to compete with Victorian makers,
owing to the South Australian Wages Board
having fixed wages on a more liberal scale
than the Victorian. Evidently the South
Australian Chamber of Manufactures is of
opinion that the only way to remove the
difficulty is to perpetuate the insane system
of misgovernment which gave rise to it, and
that the best way to cure a firoken leg is to
sit on the mule’s hind foot, and give him a
chance to break the other one.
.
The Shabby-Genteel Viewpoint.
The Anti-Labor papers, in the course of their
struggle against universal service, fathered
some weird objections, but the following,
which Sydney Telegraph quoted. approv-
ingly last week, was surely the limit :■ —
Quite a large number of boys have refused to reg-
ister, though refusal to register is punishable by a
heavy fine. It cannot be wondered at that many
boys refuse to register. You must remember that
the Governor-General’s son and the Admiral’s son
are equally liable for service with the coal-heaver s
offspring. The surroundings of the compulsory
training should be such as to make the boy take a
pride in it, instead of it being a' matter of scorn to
him.
It would read strangely in the most intoler-
ant of French royalist publications. In a
country like Australia, where practically all
except Domain and park loafers work for a
living, and in a journal which has lately
fulminated against “the wickedness and ab-
surdity of class distinctions,”. it is simply
stupefying. Though such a view is practi-
cally never heard in France, it would
more or less understandable there. . For
France only broke loose from Feudalism, a
century ago; it still possesses an inordin-
ately rich and proud landed aristocracy, and,
despite its aspirations after equality and fra-
ternity, it has a clearly defined niche for
each social unit. In such a country a sec-
tion of the inhabitants might be expected
to object to a system under which citizens
in every walk of life are forced into inti-
mate association, regardless of their up-
bringing and origin. Yet, whatever protests
do occur, they are so faint as to be inaud-
ible. There is nothing the Frenchman
dreads more than a charge of having shirked
his military duties —as witness the extraor-
dinary upheaval in the Comedie Franchise
recently, owing to a band of Anti-Semites
reminding Bernstein, the dramatist, that
he had been a deserter in the dim past.
Hilaire Belloc, M.P., after leaving the
English school where he was educated, and
before going to Oxford, crossed to France
and served his term in the ranks. In short,
to the Frenchman, rich . or poor, Jew or
Gentile, compulsory training is not “a mat-
ter of scorn.” And yet the surroundings
are, from the point of view of the veriest
bourgeois, simply awful. The French ‘picm~
piou,” or Thomas Atkins, sleeps, feeds
and dresses less luxuriously than the in-
mates of some Australian gaols. His daily
tasks comprise the most unattractive duties
of the rouseabout and the domestic help.
He cheerfully undergoes two years of this,
in many cases hundreds of miles from his
home, because his country asks it of him.
Australia does not, after the fashion of
France, require its young men to put in
two years’ uninterrupted service in an Ac-
tive or Regular Army, followed by 11 years
in a Reserve, and six in a Territorial force.
All it asks is that a certain number of
schoolboys shall, each year till they are 18,
put in 16 days’ training—consisting of
night drills, half-day drills, and a few whole-
day drills. Subsequently they will do a
further 16 days a year—of which eight days
must be spent in camp—till they reach 25.
And alleged Australians are to be
found who argue that this amounts to
an intolerable burden on our young
aristocrats, and that the fact that
' these lads may have to receive military in-
struction in the vicinity of “a coal-heaver’s
offspring,” practically justifies them in break-
ing the law, and doing that which, among
patriotic peoples, is regarded as an unfor-
givable sin. If there were not in this coun-
try a large number of intensely haughty
solicitors, commission agents, fluff-merchants
and so forth, who hold just this view, and
gravely advance it as a conclusive argu-
ment against compulsory service, it would
be a matter for diversion, not to say deri-
sion.

A Proposal to Sell a Vest Along with the
Coat and Trousers.
The Right Thinking Persons in Sydney
were quite sure on Friday that the Tiger had
broken loose at last. The main business
part of the city is built upon a narrow neck
of land —it has crowded as close as possible
to the principal wharves. Naturally, the
Harbor being very narrow thereabouts, a very
large section of the people who' want to get
to'the business part have made their homes
on the opposite side of the water. State
trams and trains pour tens of thousands of
people on to wharves on the North Shore
in the mornings; and in the evenings State
trams on the city side pour tens of thousands
of returning people on to the wharves on the
South Shore. The brief connecting link is, how-
ever, not supplied by the State: the concen-
trated traffic, gathered at great expense by
,the State, is handed over to Private Enter-
prise, represented by ferry companies. If
the State is justified in running trams,
it is equally justified in running ferries:
Private Enterprise has no more a mort-
gage over the water than it lias over
the land. In this case, the division
of service is absurd, because, as already men-
tioned, the State concentrates the passengers:
they are focussed by State lines which come
in from all directions. Tens of thousands
of them step off a State tram, and, having
been ferried across by Private Enterprise,
they step on to another State tram or train.
The Government proposes now to complete
the job ; in other words, to take its passen-
gers right through, instead of permitting
them to be pecked at en route. Other con-
siderations besides those already mentioned
have weighed with the Government. Circu-
lar Quay, where the trams disgorge their
passengers, has long been referred to as a
death-trap. Hundreds of thousands of
people have daily to cross the busiest tram-
lines in the city. In places the traffic is
so heavy that there are four parallel lines,
filled with moving trams, and men, women
and children have to thread their way be-
tween them. The Government proposes to
reduce this congestion by offering tram pas-
sengers facilities for escaping Circular Quay
altogether, and carrying them direct to State
ferries at the two points which jut out
farthest towards the North Shore. That the
State, which runs the trams and trains,
should undertake to carry its passengers right
through is a perfectly sound business propo-
rtion. On commercial grounds it is abso-
lutely unimpeachable. A man when he
wants a suit of clothes goes into a tailor's
or a clothier’s, and gets the whole suit. The
clothes-man doesn’t sell him a pair of trou-
sers, and tell him to go somewhere else to
buy a vest, and return for the coat after he
has been supplied with the vest at the other
shop. A tailor or clothier who worked on
those lines would be laughed at: yet those
ere the lines the State has.been working on.
In proposing to make a change, and supply
the vest, it simply proposes to do what every
good business man would want to do. But
that doesn’t end the matter. What it pro-
poses to do is to supply what is at best a
makeshift. If the foreshores of Circular
Quay are a death-trap, so is Sydney Cove
and the Harbor thereabouts. The hundreds '
of thousands who are ferried across are in
danger every day of their lives. The traffic
is perilously congested; and the addition of
new ferries will not reduce the congestion.
A man —or 500 men —will be just as dead
if drowned in a State-ferry disaster as if
the acicdent happened to a Private Enter-
prise ark. Nothing but a bridge or a tunnel
will permanently solve the problem. The
one justification for the ferry scheme which
the Government proposes is that_ it will re-
lieve the strain while the long job in con-
nection with the permanent solution is in
hand. If, however, the makeshift pushes the
real thing further into the distance, Sydney
would be better without it.
♦
The Discovery of a Dreadful Conspiracy.
The Wangaratta Chronicle (Vic.) has
made an important discovery :
Under the amendment in Question No. 1 which
will give over to the Federal Government control of
“Corporations,” the Shire and Borough Councils
will pass under Federal authority, and it is only
reasonable to expect that when that happens the
Labor Ministry will proceed to carry out Labor
ideals for the management of municipalities. . . .
The fact is that the Labor party has for many years
striven to get control of the Shire and Borough
Councils, and the Councils have been, of set pur-
pose, included jin the Referenda.
The Municipal Association of Victoria has
taken the matter up, and has issued a warn-
ing to the effect that the Federal Parliament
could even wind up the present municipali-
ties, and create bodies “absolutely under the
control of the Federal Parliament.” But
the half of the awful thing has not been
told. It is all the fault <?f the malevolent
Hughes, of course. This impish person “of
set purpose,” used the word “corporations,
instead of “companies,” after turning up
Webster, the standard dictionary. Therein
he read thi^: —
Corporations—(4) The abdomen or belly, especi-
ally when protuberant. [“Sirrah, my corporation is
made up of good English fat Smollett] ,
So the dreadful proposal reads now really
like this: —
Legislative Power of the Parliament. —The Par-
liament shall, subject to this Constitution, have
power to make laws for the peace, order, and good-
government of the Commonwealth with respect to
(i) Trade and commerce.
(xx) Corporations, including the creation, dis-
solution, regulation and control of corpora-
tions —
which is to say, the creation, dissolution,
regulation and control of [for the rest see
Websteb]. This is certainly a matter that
the Wangaratta Chronicle and the Muni-
cipal Association of Victoria should look
into at once. It opens up awful possibili-
ties. The “regulation and control” — : the
dreadful Labor Government evidently has
its eye on some new and drastic medicine.
Perhaps it may even order Fat, M.L.C., to
eaf only one meal a day, on pain of six
months’ gaol. Hitherto this paper had sup-
posed that, in this Referendum, “corpora-
tions” only meant trading corporations. It
seems, however, that a subtle thrust is made
at one of our most intimate possessions—a
thing many of us hold sacred. For this dis-
covery we are indebted to the Wangaratta
Chronicle and the Municipal Association
of Victoria. But for these grand pioneers
in the realms of idiocy, one might never
have suspected the dreadful conspiracy—one
might never have supposed that the National
Parliament had sinister intentions on either
Little Pedlington or Little Mary.
Willie Watt, who is being boomed as a
great Anti-Referenda speaker by the (Melb.)
Argus and the Victorian Liberal League, has
discovered a new reason why the people
should vote “No” on April 20. What, he
asked, would be said L»y the people of Ire-
land when they were granted Home Rule,
if the British Parliament reserved to itself
the powers which the Australian Parliament
is asking for, particularly the power to con-
trol internal trade! There was no differ-
ence, he alleged, between that supposititious
action and the action of the Australian Par-
liament in trying to “take” these powers
fiom the States; and he challenged anyone
in the hall to point out the difference, if
there was any. Probably 00 per cent, of
his hearers knew exactly what the differ-
ence was; but, as the meeting had just
seen a woman removed from the hall for a
little good-natured interjection, nobody ac-
cepted the challenge, and Willie Watt
cried exultantly, “They don’t know!” and
looked as though he had scored a fine point.
The difference, which was not explained be-
cause nobody was given a chance, is this.
In the case of Ireland, a British Parlia-
ment, which is not elected wholly by the
people, would be taking the power from a
Parliament which is to be wholly elected by
the people; while in Australia the one and
only Parliament which is wholly elected
by the people on adult suffrage, is seeking
some of the powers at present held (and
mostly not used) by a number of Parlia-
ments, not one of which is wholly elected
on adult suffrage. Which is about as large
a difference as there could be.

Two persons charged with murder have been
acquitted by Melbourne juries within the
past week or so, and the two citizens they
were accused of murdering are as dead as
ever. In one case a young man, whose only
witnesses were two friendly damsels of shady
reputation, was charged with the death of
another young man in the Edinburgh Gar-
dens. The victim’s body was found lying
face-downwards in the grass. The left eye
was protruding. Death had been caused by
very violent injuries. Nobody but the ac-
cused and his girl-witnesses could be pro-
duced to say how the murdered man came to
be in the garden at all. It was suggested
that his pockets had been picked in the
streets, and that he had followed the party
of three to get his money back. The accused
young man’s story was that he had a stand-
up fight with the athletic young citizen.
That, however, didn’t offer any reasonable
explanation of the corpse’s shocking injuries,
and the Judge appeared not to be impressed
by it. Still the prisoner was acquitted. A
decent citizen was done to death by some-
one, and the doer escaped punishment. The
other case was that of Olive Moo die, who
was found not guilty of murdering her
mother with poison. In this case the evi-
dence for the prosecution was purely circum-
stantial, while for the defence the prisoner s
story suggested that the mother had poisoned
herself —in spite of the fact that the sick
woman had complained to the doctor of her
medicine burning her throat. The Judge
didn’t seem to think much of this story
either. Still, after one jury had disagreed,
another said “Not guilty.” So the cause of
the awful damage to Archibald Steane’s
left eye, and the reason for the presence of
arsenic in Mrs. Moodie’s stomach, are added
to the list of mysteries which the ineffective
police and detective force of Victoria haven’t
been able to clear up.

“Albatross” gives an old shipmate a send-
off :—
The landsman has an idea that the seafaring man
never thinks of the perils of the sea. Less than
three years ago I was serving as chief officer with
Captain Knight in the Yongala—the ship that has
carried him to Davy Jones. Do you suppose /
didn’t think of the perils of the sea when—when we
got the news? „ „ .
Captain Knight was one of the white men of
the precarious profession, considerate to his crew,
and enforcing discipline with that diplomacy which
goes to make life bearable on board ship. Old
Bill,” as he was known to those of us who had
the pleasure of serving under him, knew the Queens-
land 1 coast as well as any man, and only an almost
impossible situation could have _ put an end to his
blameless career in the Adelaide Company. He
rlirl his dutv to his owners, and did it well, at the
same time recognising that his officers and the rest
of his crew were part of the show. A good, brave

The Conscience Clause.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a movement on foot in Melbourne “to take
such steps as may be necessary to secure the intro-
duction of a conscience clause in our defence laws.’’
When flags are licking through the smoke.
And frantic bugles cry,
While mighty guns with giant stroke
Are shattering the sky,
I lie at home. God bless the laws
That granted me a conscience clause !
The foeman turns, and strips the land,
And fires the regal town.
A fevered Asiatic band
With bloody hands come down.
I rise in grief to bid them pause,
And quote my sacred conscience clause.
They shame my wife, and slay my child,
And give my home to fire.
So to a cavern in the wild
I hastily retire.
Alone, and nude, and famished here,
My comfort is a conscience clear!

sufficient to recompense him for the risks he takes.
Successful lawyers and doctors fix their own emolu-
ments ; but the seaman (successful or otherwise)
who asks for a decent wage is “an agitator” and
“a menace to the ‘profession.’ ” In the old days,
when the shipmaster got commissions on freights,
it was reasonable to look upon him as a unit of the
“firm”; but in there times, when he has nothing
to do with freights, and attends mostly to pilotage
duties, he is merely a wage-earner. It is difficult
to get shipmasters to see this. The old fetich of
the “cloth” is still with them. And their pay
suffers in consequence.
I write feelingly. “Old Bill” has gone. God rest

“Curse o’ Moses” on the things left un-
said :
The Sydney Morning Herald complains that, in
his speech on the Referendum, Mr. Fisher never
once mentioned the Empire. This is exceedingly
sad, and makes us wonder whither this large conti-
nent is drifting. In point of fact, Mr. Fisher’s
speech was full of omissions. For nearly two hours
he addressed an enthusiastic Australian audience,
and in the whole course of his speech he made no
reference to the Athanasian controversy, the differential
calculus, Bickerton’s theory of partial impact, the
invasion of Europe by the Seljuk Turks, the manufac-
ture of raspberry jam, the claims of Maria Theresa,
the Copernican system, the discovery of America,
the signing of Magna Charta, the Chilian patriot
O’lliggins, the death of Julius Cjesar, the effects of
drought on pumpkins, the Old Red Sandstone period,
the French Revolution, the Adventures of Robinson
Crusoe, the Anglo-Japanese conspiracy, the state of
thermal activity in Iceland, the price of beer at
Broken Hill, or the possibility of deriving the
Federal land tax from Middle Harbor oysters. All
these pressing matters were quite ignored. Really,
a great statesman should be more careful. It is a
well-known rule of effective oratory that any person
attempting to discuss the Shakspearian sonnet
should, as far as possible, confine his remarks to the
manufacture of straw hats; and anyone desiring to
convince an audience that Cleopatra was the mother
of Moses should devote the whole time at his dis-
posal to the consideration of the properties of Homer’s
iliad, when used as a beverage. By inference, in speak-
ing on any Australian subject, the first and most ab-
solute necessity is to talk all the time about India,
England, Hong Kong and other remote places. Perhaps
Mr. Fisher will have learned this lesson by the time he
returns from helping George Rex to put on his
official hat.

“Clarence O’Hagan” on Some Roosters
and a National Swindle:—
The Sydney press—with, of course, a set pur-
pose —made a great fuss because King O’Malley
referred to the head officials of his Department as
“roosters” and “boodlers.” I rise to second the
Picturesque One’s remarks on the “rooster” count.
I know the crowd well, and the term “roosters” fits
to the ankle-bones. For ten solid years three of
them have practically run the country, as far as
any permanent Civil servant can run it. These
three are all bigoted Sydney men —not Australians
at all, in the genuine sense. They entered the De-
partment loaded to the muzzle with the idea that
Sydney is N.S.W., and N.S.W. is Australia, and
they have acted up to the idea with great regu-
larity ever since. If ever the true story of the
disgraceful Yass-Canberra swindle comes to light,
these three gentlemen (personally they are gentle-
men) will be found prominently in the piece.
Forrest, a great Australian in many ways, be-
lieved in and fought for Dalgety; the Three Roost-
ers thwarted him. When Fuller was at their
head —a Canberra-mad Minister, if ever there was
one —the speed with which the Capital-site business
was pushed was something to marvel at. O’Malley
next came on the scene, and he was astounded to
find that, long before there was Parliamentary author-
isation —let alone national approval—of the Huge Job,
the Departmental “roosters,” aided and abetted by
Fuller, had got things cut and dried, and had
committed the Government in a dozen ways. Now,
O’Malley had always rightly contended that the
Capital question was a national question, to be
settled by the people themselves. Personally he
was strongly in favor of Dalgety—one of its
warmest advocates, indeed. The malign influence
of W. M. Hughes dragged the Fisher Government
into a foolish endorsement of the Fuller Capital-
site P.N., and reluctantly O’Malley went over
to the party view. The result, so far, is known.
“So far,” because when the next Big Drought
comes—and it’s getting quite close now —the Can-
swindle will be abandoned in a hurry. Even the
Three Roosters will want to stop away from it.
They worked for the dear, old Sydney interest, and
the Importing Press of their boyhood, and they
have their reward.

“Bash” says it’s loaded: —
In my township, not 100 miles from Terang
(Vic.), a horse died from that deadliest and swiftest
of stock diseases, anthrax. The vet. who diagnosed
the case, following what, from personal experience
and hearsay, I believe to be the invariable custom,
cut an ear off the defunct neddy, packed it in cot-
ton-wool, squeezed it into a cardboard box, wrapped
the box in paper, addressed it to the Stock Depart-
ment, Melbourne, and posted, it in the ordinary way
—presumably for bacteriological examination. The
vet. and the Department ought to know the risk
of sending such a specimen promiscuously through
the general post; but apparently the G.P.O. people
are ignorant. An instance or two that have come
under my own observation may put them wise to the
ease with which human beings may acquire an-
thrax.
On the next farm but one to my own a beast which
had died of anthrax was being skinned (your true
cocky is thrifty at any cost!), and the owner’s son, a
lad of 19, scratched the side of one finger with
the point of the knife he was using. In an hour’s
time a pustule had formed, and though the father
harnessed up in haste, and had the boy under treat-
ment almost immediately, a second pustule broke
out further up the finger, and the patient was left
with the alternative of life with nine digits, or
death with ten. He chose wisely, and a prompt
amputation saved his life. In a second instance
a cattle-man scratched the back of one hand with
a piece of bone from an anthrax-carcase he was pre-
paring to destroy. Result, death in 12 hours —it
usually occurs, in any event, inside 36 hours from
the inoculation. A third case, also ending -‘fatally,
was the infection of a farm hand from a bifc upon
the ear inflicted by a fly, which had been dining on
the carcase of a steer that had died of the disease.
On that evidence I make oath and say that the
vets, who dump anthrax into the public mails, the
Stock Department which sanctions the practice, or
the postal authorities who permit it, are guilty of
culpable (I was going to say criminal) negligence.
They can fight it out amongst themselves.

So narrow was the margin between the
completion of the new Adelphi Theatre, Syd-
ney, and the opening ceremony on April 5,
that the last nail went in with a clatter as
Mayor Allen Taylor appeared before the foot-
lights to breathe a blessing on the building,
whereat the Mayor, mistaking the noise for
the extra appreciation of a big Dago at
the Council’s failure to break up the fish
ring, bowed with proper solemnity. After
that all went well. The theatre was de-
clared open, congratulations and cheers were
distributed to all concerned, including the
City Council, to which the property will re-
vert in 50 years, and Paddy’s Market, for
passing out to provide the site. Finally,
sandwiches and the usual choice of sauces.
In the evening the Marlow Dramatic Co. com-
menced its season in the theatre with “The
Bad Girl of the Family,” before a crowded
house. She is not a brand-new bad girl;
rather she is a conglomeration of old girl,
good, bad and indifferent. In these days
of doubtful axioms and proven paradoxes,
no man can say with certainty what consti-
tutes a bad or a good girl, and the writer
will venture no further opinion on Bess
Moore (Miss Nellie Ferguson) than that she
is a good actress. Robert Inman, Harry Diver,
J. P. O’Neill and John Cosgrove owned
the capable hands that the bulk of the work
was left in ; and Essie Clay and Beth Mur-
doch put their talents to the wheel to some
purpose. And it was a kind of wheel that
needed it. The Bad Girl will expose her
past till further notice.

Year by year pantomime gets nearer and
nearer to musical comedy, inasmuch as they
both approximate more closely to vaudeville.
“Jack and the Beanstalk” —the show which
arrived from Melbourne last week, and was
produced at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, on Sat-
urday night—beats all records in the matter
of sparseness of plot. On the other hand,
the scenic effects are marvels of vastness,
brilliancy and color; the humor is mostly
humorous; the songs are the sort that the
habitual pantomime-frequenter best loves;
the patriotism (Australian, as opposed to
the British Empire League brand) is unim-
peachable ; and the star turns are dazzling.
“THE BAD GIRL OF THE FAMILY,"
AT THE ADELPHI.
It is in accordance with the spirit of
modern pantomime that the Pantzer troupe,
who are mere excrescences, so to speak, on
the face of the performance, should be its
best feature. These acrobats easily beat
anything in their line that has visited Aus-
tralia in the writer’s recollection. Neil Ken-
yon’s Dame Trott is a female of severely re-
strained absurdity. Evidently she is the
herald of a new order of Dames. She stands
midway between the old-time panto, mother —
who was a woman of disreputable habits and
rotten ethics, with the appearance of a
Water Police Court habitue —and a Dame
who shall be no more grotesque as to ap-
pearance, manner or sentiments than your
average “Liberal” lady-organiser. Jack
Cannot is an amusing King, who possesses a
better singing voice than most of the mon-
archs with whom this paper is accustomed to
foregather. Miss Sibyl Arundale is a de-
lightful, melodious and graceful little Jack,
and Miss Dorothy Firmin a sweetheart of
whom any boy might be proud. Miss Cora
Hamilton (solo dancer), the Doherty Sisters
(Ginger Maidens from the U.S.), Miss Marie
Eaton (Soprano) and W. A. Hassan (Cow)
are all excellent in their several ways.

A clergyman has advertised his intention
of delivering a series of sermons on "The
Woman in the Case,” now running at Syd-
ney Criterion. That looks like success. It
the cleric praises the play, the Wowser will
go in large numbers because he may ; if, con-
trariwise, the holy man damns it, the Wow-
ser will go in even greater numbers, because
he mustn’t. In either case, the Wowser is
urged to book early, since the Criterion is
suffering, just now, from a rush of those
unregenerate ones who go to stirring shows
regardless of the Church’s tips.

There are various things which this paper
thinks it superfluous to mention. Thus it
doesn’t, as a rule, allude to the fact that
there are fish in the sea, birds in the air, or
16oz. to the lb., if you watch the man while
he’s weighing. On the same principle it be-
gins to suspect that it is superfluous to say
that “Our Miss Gibbs” is at the Royal.
The lady last evening made her two hundred
and somethingth appearance; and when mat-
ters have gone that far it may be regarded as
a habit.

R. A. Roberts, the quick changer at Syd-
ney Tivoli, is more numerous than ever.
Last week he was five people in a Dick Tur-
pin sketch ; this week he is eight people in a
brisk playlet called “Ringing the Changes.”
Peggy Pryde, the joyous, bustling little
English comedienne, was billed to make her
reappearance on Saturday, after eight long
years; but illness kept her away. A vast
sigh went up from the crowded house when
the sorrow was announced. Conjurer Leip-
zig, Florence Challis, Alexander Prince and
Tom Dawson complete the first line of
amusement, which will be a very strong one
indeed when Peggy is well enough to take
her place in it.

The Royal Hawaiians opened a Sydney
season at the Y.M.C.A. Hall on Saturday,
and what the audience thought of the show
may be judged by the fact that 20 items
scored 15 encores. The programme contains
several English choruses, but the regal Ha-
waiians shine more dazzlingly in native chor-
uses, and in the items for the Hawaiian
equivalents of the guitar and mandolin.
Also, there is a native instrument, the uku-
lele, which hasn’t any equivalent, and is
handled with great skill. The co. consists of
eight sunburnt gentlemen and two ladies.
The gentlemen wear “hot” socks, and the
ladies wear large smiles —and other things.
The section which owns the socks includes a
bass soloist, James Kamakani, whose full,
deep voice was heard to most advantage in
“Wiliwiliwai.” The other large item
among the males is Ernest Kaai, the musical
director, who, besides singing a ballad, plays
a medley on the ukulele, on which weird
instrument he is understood to be a Kubelik
and a Percy Grainger rolled into one, and
baked brown. The Hawaiian instrumental
march “Hilo” was a particularly fine item.
The ancient Hula Dance, by Miss Anehila —
the lady who owns the larger of the two
smiles—is performed to the accompaniment
of a gourd and a bag of marbles, and is more
quaint than attractive. To a large extent
it consists of hip movements, which suggest
that the lady is in a tight place, and wants
to escape. The whole show is off the beaten
track, and may be recommended as a refresh-
ing change after a course of sodden Easter
cookery.

The thief, murderer, or other estimable
citizen who hankers to inaugurate another
“Mystery of a Hansom Cab,” and thereby lay
the foundation for further crowded houses at
West’s picture shows, while adequately re-
couping himself for his enterprise, has only
to waylay G. L. Peterson on his journey
from Wirths’ Circus these nights with the
cash takings. They are big and comforting.
The suggestion is offered free of cost by the
writer, he not having time to carry it into
effect owing to the enormous problem facing
him as to whether he should kidnap No. 1
Adelia sister, No. 2 Adelia sister, Miss May
Martin, or Miss Quira Mears. The main
thing restraining him is that to elope with
even one would deplete the ring of a gem,
and plunge the front chairs in mourning.
On the other hand, there would be plenty
of attractions left in the well-trained horses,
dogs, jugglers, trick jockeys, acrobats and
clowns, to say nothing of the Flying Jor-
dans. So far, Marco, the animal trainer,
hasn’t been chewed in his big iron enclosure
by a lion, tiger, wolf, or even billygoat, and
he reckons on getting through his perform-
ance every night during the Sydney season
in Prince Alfred Park without losing a but-
ton of his uniform. With a bit more prac-
tice Marco will have as strong a nerve as a
No-No politician.

Melbourne seems disposed to accept “The
Belle of Brittany,” at the Royal, as a hand-
some example of that kind of comic opera in
which the plot is starved to fatten one or
two of the character parts, and the music is
more remarkable for nimble orchestration
than alluring melody. All the same, Mel-
bourne is still in two minds about “The
Belle.” With the exception of Tom Walls,
who is a well-defined (and strictly modern)
joke throughout the proceedings, and Miss
Gilliam, the heroine of the “Butter” ditty, the
company doesn’t seem to lay enough empha-
sis on its remarks and actions. The per-
formance is too flippant. Miss O’Connor’s
manner of breaking off her engagement with
the cook from Paris is not more tender than
the chef’s way of bearing the blow. Half
a dozen times during the evening one wishes
that the people in possession of the stage
would take their foolishness more seriously.
Consequently, the pungent monologues of
Walls overwhelm the narrative, and reduce
the sentimental interest —which is desirable
even in comic opera—to a shadowy back-
ground. Not enough is made of the flimsy
but neatly-woven story, and the climax ar-
rives in a violent hurry, as though it were
running to catch a train.

For a fortnight only “The Waltz Dream”
is reviving its substantial German music
and serio-comic story at Her Majesty’s.
Melbourne remembers that the opera nearly
bursts into tears on account of Princess
Florence Young, whose husband damns the
royal dynasty, and breaks away from the
palace on his wedding night. It is the opera
wherein Roberts, the Prince Consort, chases
a waltz tune to a beer garden, and gets
sweetly entangled with the conductress of a
ladies’ orchestra. Their lingering kiss is
so long that it threatens to end in a royal
divorce; but the angel of the beer garden
has virtuous scruples about capturing a
prince consort, so she sympathises with ms

bride, and restores him to his matrimonial
obligations by means of the waltz tune.
Roberts and Florence Young are received
with acclamation in characters in which
their top notes ring to the best advantage,
and in which their clothes deserve a double
encore. Langford Kirby is again th 6 pran-
cing Chamberlain with astonished eyebrows,
and Florence Vie is the fat girl who craves
for food. Otherwise the cast is new to
Melbourne. Lottie Sargent has the pleas-
ing character of the Bandmistress, and she
plays it prettily and feelingly. Frank
Green is the pal who introduces
Roberts into beer garden society, and
Victor Prince is the alleged potentate of
the petty German Court. Regarded as a
caricature of any sort of potentate, he is a
dire failure; but as a plump low comedian,
whose stage royalty has been thrust upon
him, he is very pardonable. The most re-
grettable thing about Victor Prince is his
name; in his present capacity it sounds like
an uncalled-for joke.

VICTOR CHAMPION CONDUCTING
“ THE BELLE OF BRITT ANY."
At the Opera House the humorous juggling
of seven Perezoffs is the prevailing novelty;
but, apart from the supper party of dexter-
ous strangers, there are some re-arrived
couples who were not there last week.
Cooper and Lait came back on Saturday for
a final innings, and the Dartos danced in
with “Le Visiteur.” For the rest, the Col-
umbia Trio sing and frivol as before, the
costumes of Miss Spark shine with undimin-
ished gaudiness, and the Dogs are butting
the football for a few more farewell nights.

Last week West’s Melbourne Palace had
the usual batch of films dealing with heart-
throbs, like “The Greater Call,” or mercurial
stuff, like “Poor Sick Men.” A large pic-
ture de-luxe, by-the-bye, is announced to
flash at an early date. The subject is
“Henry VIII.,” as photoed by the Barker
Co. from Herbert Tree’s gorgeous produc-
tion at His Majesty’s, London. The item
exhibits Tree, Bourchier, Miss Violet Van-
brugh, and others, and spectacularly is de-
scribed as the attar of magnificence.

“L’Aiglon,” whom little Tillie Brune made
familiar to Australia, has been the subject
of a picture at the Prahran Lyric (Vic.).
The young man, played by an actor of poetic
exterior, is mostly shown as a romantic in-
valid, feeding on dreams of his father’s,
glories. The film is effective, and includes
a rich final scene, in which the boy dies with
a profusion of Napoleonic gestures. An-
other Lyric attraction of late has been
“In A Moment’s Folly”—a picture sugges-
tive of Bernstein’s “Thief,” watered down.
The curse of St. Kildam :
The highly disrespected Council of St. Kilda (Melb.
has decided that it “ wouldn’t like to see ” the affairs of
that marine suburb “conducted from Yass-Canberra,”
and therefore “would advise all the ratepayers to vote
against the Referendum.” The writer wishes to Heaven
that St. Kilda could be governed from anywhere other
than its Town Hall, and by anybody other than the pre-
sent crowd of councillors. He lives in a sideway turning
off one of the oldest streets, where the rents are pretty
high and the rates match the rents. The new houses in
this part have been occupied for a whole year, but the
road all that time has remained unmade, unlighted, un-
named and uncommonly dangerous. In fact, its condi-
tion is a disgrace to the jacks-in-offlce who are advising
the ratepayers “ to vote against the Referendum," what
ever that may mean !
“ Prahran ” is likely to be rubbed out of
Melbourne’s municipal and local records, and
“St. Kilda” along with it, the councils of those
two “cities” having decided to amalgamate and
call themselves South Yarrn, providing the citizens
are agreeable. And the, citizens, being in favor
of any progressive move that will substitute one
strong effective authority for numerous small,
squabbling and expensive bodies, are quite certain
to be agreeable.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Turtle”: I’m tired of all this talk about the
alleged want of patriotism on the part of Australian
theatregoers. Local audiences, and particularly thp
tightly-jammed gallery crowds, are most enthusiastic
over Australian performers. Asche drew the largest
houses ever known to our theatres; Amy Castles was
more rushed than Bel Sorel; Dolly Castles, as prin-
cipal panto-boy, would (like Florence Young in
“Mother Goose”) draw more people than any impor-
ted lead. Nellie Stewart packed the lonely Princess’s
everv night of her Melbourne season. The Austra-
lian'kiddies in the pantos, have always received (and
deserved) our best applause. Same applies to our
chorus-girls. The frigid reception given to the rather
stiff imports who deigned to appear with “The Gay
Gordons” recently should have taught a lesson ; but
the importing foolishness will no doubt continue
until we get rid of the old-fashioned managers, who,
instead of catering for an increasingly patriotic pub-
lic, are pandering to the weak-kneed Australians of
20 years ago.
“H.T.”: 1 think it’s about time someone got in
an uppercut on the music hysteria. I read the
other day that a “critic” thought one of Kubelik’s
scrapings sounded like a fountain playing in the
moonlight. This sort of thing ought to be knocked
out. Music is a mental game, like anagrams. The art is
in piecing the notes together to get an expression.
The higher the class of music the harder it is to piece
it together; that is why people who can understand
“Lohengrin” are so conceited. There is nothing ele-
vating or soulful in music. Musicians as a class are
the meanest and most cantankerous folk about. Surely
this proves the failure of music to make good. The
men who are doing things—the thinkers, writers and
scientists —-can seldom tell “Tommy Atkins” from
“God Save.” The sooner this fancy talk about a
piano-thumper’s “soul” is jumped on, the sooner we
will have him doing useful work. Many a musician
is a loss to the bricklaying trade.
The stage-struck condition of Melbourne’s “middle
classes” is strikingly apparent in the airs and graces
of the new Juvenile Opera Co. which J. C. William-
son has organised for touring purposes. The young-
sters, who played “The Geisha” in Melbourne last
week, and are now in S.A., appear to be on the
stage for their parents’ pleasure rather than profit.
Whereas panto, kiddies in general are wage-earners
working for the family, these juvenile opera nippers
look like suburban society amateurs revelling in the
importance of being professionals for a time. One
fancies that they think no small potatoes of them-
selves, in comparison with “common” children.
“Stargazer”: J. C. Williamson takes the juvenile
Comic op. industry in hand as an effective and
profitable means of providing recruits for the Royal
Comics, and in disregard of threatened legislation
to wipe the infant prodigy from public life. The
'juveniles got going with “The Geisha,” and suc-
ceeded in strengthening my conviction that operas
of this class are designed and builded for kids. The
utter childishness of the matter and the infantile
quality of the prattle are brought home to all by the
babes on the boards. Never for a moment is any-
thing intellectually a cut above the adolescent actor
of 12 and the immature actress of 10. But where Gil-
bert and Sullivan were interesting even in the hands
of babes and sucklings, plays of “The Geisha” sort
are a hollow mockery without an adult chorus to
google the front stalls, and I cannot picture them
running without legs.

“Invercargill”: The “comedy” and “dramatic”
films at the flicker shows don’t appeal to the deaf
and dumb, for the reason that, by reading the lips
of the actors, such persons can follow the dialogue
as well as the action. It is a notorious fact that
professional cinematographic actors seldom follow
their “lines.” They keep close to the action indi-
cated in the scenario they are playing, but say any-
thing that comes into their heads. The ordinary
person is none the wiser; but recently in N’York
there was trouble when a school of deaf and dumb
children went to a show. The mutes lost interest
as soon as they discovered that the words spoken by
the actors had “nothing to do with the case.”
However, when one of the actresses in a Broncho Bill
comedy film began to tell one of the cowboys a
“high” story, the master in charge thought it time
to remonstrate. In the following film there were a
number of show girls in the back ground all telling
spicy tales while the hero and heroine occupied the
centre of the flicker, and as the interest of the deaf
and dumb kids was rapidly reviving, they were
hurried from the hall. To learn lip talk would add
a great interest to the average flickergraph show.
Motoring Gossip.
Cheap motor-cars, like all other cheap lines of
machinery, soon become absolutely valueless, as
their faults are so generally known to everybody,
and also that the market is flooded with them in
second-hand condition. High-grade cars of the
Wolseley or Renault type are always a saleable
asset, and are generally difficult to procure second-
hand, and to anyone starting motoring, to advise
them to buy the best is a safe proposition.*
“The Pessimist”: Sydney’s latest theatre, the
Adelphi, cost its owners, of whom T. E. Rofe is
principal, a good deal niore than was anticipated,
and if they get their money back in 50 years, when
the whole property automatically goes back into the
possession of the City Council, I’ll be pleasantly sur-
prised—if I’m not where I expect to be. It cost
over £30,000 to put up the building, which was
£lB,OOO in excess of the amount insisted upon by
the Council. The theatre will accommodate 3000
people, but it seems likely that cheap prices will
have to be charged practically all the time, and
unless I am very much mistaken the two circles will
be shunned to a large extent. The upper circle is
too high and the dress-circle seats are too uncom-
fortable. Authorities vouch for the statement that
the theatre is the coolest and most fire-proof in Syd-
ney, and the conveniences might serve as a general
example in a city where theatre-goers’ con-
veniences appear to be the last thing thought
of. But that is not everything. Neither is
cheap melodrama, which will probably be the
theatre’s sheet-anchor. George Marlow, the lessee,
who also leases the Princess’s (Melb.), says that he
has his chance now, and promises big attractions
from abroad; but “The Liver on the Doorknob” and
“The Fatal Titter” will have to carry the baby as a
general habit, and I’m glad that Marlow’s share of
the infant isn’t bigger than it is.
The Taits are borrowing several musical “attrac-
tions” from J. Bull. Leonard Borwick, a pianist,
disembarks a shortish head of hair some time in
June. About August the twelve Huddersfield Bell-
ringers are promised, and later bn Ben Davies and
Miss Esta d’Argo will bring their oratorio voices.
For next year the Tait attractions will include
Kirkby Lunn, a contralto with a successful past.
“D.”: A humorous feature of the “From Forest to
Fireside” film, now being shown all over the Com-
monwealth, is the “Editorial Room” of Lloyd’s
NEws. Message boys are seen tearing about with
wires; frantic persons hurl themselves at telephones ;
others manipulate the tape as though their lives de-
pended on their briskness. In the midst .of the up-
roar sits a fatuous-looking young man, self-consci-
ously gnawing a cigarette. In intervals between his
struggles to kep the latter alight, he writes with the
celerity of a stage-hero penning an appeal for im-
mediate assistance. The slips he hurls at waiting
minions, who project themselves like live shells
into the outer darkness. And Lloyd’s News is a
staid old Sabbath sheet, which never by any chance
finds out a thing for itself, but simply lifts the best
“stories” of its contemps., and passes them on to a
public avid for twice-told tales.
“Pat O’Maori”: I rise to howl an indignant vitu-
peration against the Wowserisation of the pictorial
representations of gore and galloping cut-throats.
Sydney theatres, which nightly draw their silver
from the exhibitions of horrible red Indians on the
murder track, and the weddings of half-naked savage
girls to poor whites, are turning down the films which
portray the native Australian bushranger. The
Wowser said the bushranger wasn’t good, and the
picture showmen at once agreed with him, and pro-
mised never to do it again. Rats! Also, pigs,
beetles and C. G. Wade. If berlud is bad for the patrons
of jiggergrams, why not do away with the foreign
horror first ? The fact is that the Wowser wail
suited the showmen’s pockets. It is easier and
cheaper to import the American gorescape than to
make the local one. If local pictures are to be made,
they will afford employment to quite a number of
Australian actors and actresses, and that is a very
horrible (and expensive) proposal. Of all the
haters of Australia the Wowser seems to come easily
first. He denounces the bushranger, and hasn’t a
word to say against the Indian horror with the dis-
rupted turkey’s tail round his savage cranium. Now,

Australian Blood Spilt Here l”

HER MAJESTY'S.
MELBOURNE.
(Back from the grave.)
The old comedy of
“Vice Versa,” which
Brough and Boueicault
introduced to Australia
some 24 years ago, has
had a revival in London
as a play for schoolboys.
It was staged this Christ-
mas, and is to be revived
again next Christmas.
Anstey’s quaint little
story is, at least, more
educational than a panto.
“Mary McCommonwealth”: I am of opinion that
all women should be enrolled for the defence of Aus-
tralia. I am fairly good with the flat-iron myself,
and I know a number of sweet young friends who
could give a tolerably good account of their hat-
pins in the deadly breach; but I am convinced that
the sword is woman’s natural weapon, and that we
could more than hold our own with the implement
which our lords have discarded. The other evening
I witnessed the struggle between William Shak-
speare and a number of ladies under the leadership
of Miss Rose Seaton. The dispute was over “Two
Gentlemen of Verona,” and Shakspeare looked like
holding his own until our party drew their swords.
That settled the matter. Old Bill saw that the game
was up, and with a shudder retired to his place
among the shades. It is all very well for people in
their pride of trousers to speak slightingly of our
valor, but put swords in our hands and see what we
can do!
“Floater”: Privately the late Max Maxwell was
one of the most unmummerly of mummers. He
had certain artistic instincts, but these were never
expressed along lines of booze, belles, or Bohem-
ianism. He was well-conducted to the brink of
primness, honorable to the verge of Quixotry, and
extremely “saving.” Much of his little horde was
sunk in "his dramatic enterprise, but some of it went
in providing a home for two relatives (other than
his wife and child) whom he regularly supported
right up to his death.
George Wirth, writing from New York last
month, mentioned that he had despatched a first
consignment of new people for the Circus —13 of
them in all —and was off to London and Europe in
search of further turns. Somehow the vaunted
hustle and bustle of New York life has failed to
impress George W. “They call it a fast place,” he
writes, “but the only things fast about it are
the people who get out of the way of tram cars
and automobiles. Everything else is dead slow.”
“10.2.4.”: I see that W. E. Johnson, M.H.R., has
written and had produced in the Rockdale (N.S.W.)
Town Hall, a play called “The Prince of Petriana.”
Amazing the egotism of these politicians! Johnson
has no valid claim to pose as Prince of Petriana pre-
varicators ; he was beaten hands down by both
George Reid and Joseph Carruthers. It is possible,
of course, that some fool-comp, or other has set
“Petriana” for “petrifaction.” In that case I have
no quarrel with W. Elliott Johnson’s new title.
A ramshackle milkman of Woolloomooloo
was haled before Sydney Water Summons Court
last week, and charged with having carried two
gallons of water on his cart whilst delivering
milk. The water carrier, instead of the usual
painted sign, merely had his name chalked on the
cart, and, seeing the Law about to swoop,
hurriedly tried to rub out the inscription. On the
Law demanding a sample from one particular can,
the pump-juice seller upset it and allowed the
contents to flow down the gutter. And the fatu-
ous magistrate fined him £5 for carrying the water
and a like amount for refusing a sample from the
overturned can, though he was well aware that he
had the power to make the first fine £2O and the
second £10 —indeed he mentioned the fact him-
self. Instead of being tapped with even a £2O
fine the blurred chalk-sign milkman who rattles
round with water on his cart, and heaves his alleged
milk over the roadway when asked for a sample,
should stand shoulder to shoulder with the person
who has been caught with housebreaking tools in
his possession. The offence is much the same ;
the only difference is that the man with the
jemmy is only out to rob the householder of his
cash ; whereas the adulterator is out to steal both
cash and health. This paper begins to suspect
that the people who keep a loaded revolver for the
furtive burglar who never arrives might make a
lot better use of it.
Just sailed from Hobart, for London via
ports, s.s. Papanui, with 110,000 cases of apples,
a valuable general cargo and an assortment of
coronators. For a lucky “spec” the Papanui
beats the whales lately blown ashore on the
northern beaches of Tasmania. Twelve months
ago she was proudly displaying the flag of the
Shaw, Savill and Albion Co., the big traders
between Maoriland and Britain, Originally her
cost was between £120,000 and £150,000, for the
Shaw-Savill is one of those firms that don’t stint
things when they are fitting out their mail boats.
When, last year, she ran on an uncharted rock
off the Tas. coast her value for some days was 2d.
Finally, she reached Melbourne, w-as condemned
by the underwriters, put up for auction, and
bought for a mere ditty by a Melbourne syndi-
cate. After a row with the Melbourne Marine
Board the Papanui staggered over the sea to Naga-
saki. There she was repaired by cheap Jap labor,
and after being returned to Australia, she was sur-
veyed for a first-class passenger certificate.
Expert and envious critics put down the total
cost of refitting at under £30,000, or say £lOO,OOO
less than her cost price. If the P. and 0., the
Orient, and the N.D.L. Co.’s can make a good
thing by running apples, coronators, wool and ore
to British ports in vessels representing (say)
£lOO,OOO each, there must be a nice margin for the
Melbourne syndicate which furbished up the
Papanui for a third of the money.
“Isaac Gumboil, J.P.”: Appalled at the
woeful lack of decency among the bathers, I
quitted that scene of sin, shapes and sunshine for
a quieter stretch of sand, where I could sit and
meditate upon the evils of Federation and bad
drainage. Suddenly I became aware of an un-
pleasant-looking man hovering about me, with a
most disquieting look in his eye, and his hand
fumbling mysteriously in the breast of his coat.
I didn’t like it at all. Rising quietly, I hurried
off; and, finding another secluded spot, again
settled down, hoping this time to be safe from all
interruption. But not so. Something rustled
amongst the trees behind me. Turning quickly,
I saw a figure moving towards me through the
foliage. My nerves could stand no more. Seizing
my bag of buns, I fled towards the wharf. Board-
ing a ferry, I eventually reached the Quay in
safety and a cold sweat. Somewhat unnerved,
and exceedingly annoyed over my wasted morn-
ing, I wandered across to the Domain, there to
rest and recover myself ’midst the sunshine and
flowers. But was my persecution at an end ? No.
A sudden rustle in the grass beside me, and some-
one sprang upon me. I was aware of a red,
whiskery face looking into mine with the sordid,
hungry glare of a State Premier spearing Federal
encroachments with a tooth-pick. “Sign it ! ’ he
hoarsely snarled, shoving a paper into my face.
With that awful, ravenous stare holding my eyes,
I quakingly scrawled as he directed. Then, rudely
snatching the, pen from my hand, he began to
move away. Recovering myself somewhat, I
seized him and held him back. “Might I ask,” I
began angrily, “what mean you by” He
fixed me with an offensively elated stare. “Shut
up !” he said. “ Ye’re worth twenty-five bob to
OUR State, yeh fool !” and abruptly departed in
eager search of further spoils.
THE DEGENERATION OF BILL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On account of the low prices charged for ad-
mission picture shows are largely patronised by
chUciren, and might be made not only a source, of
amusement, but one of instruction and profit. But
what do we find? Nearly every entertainment has
Tome wholesale stabbing or shooting, and murders
are made as realistic as possible —the criminal, by
the way, invariably escaping justice. I know of one
bov, who has not yet .seen seven Rummers who now
threatens to stab his sister. —William Medd, in S. M.
Herald.
We never rightly grasped what Willie was
Until we let him see a picture show,
An inoffensive little child he seemed. . . .
The lights, the crowd, the music—l dunno
Exactly what stirred all the bad in Bill,
And plunged him headlong in Sin s undertow.
The first we knew he went and took to Beer.
He stayed out nightly till eleven. Bill
Was one of the boy-drunks whom Nicholls saw
Blind tight in fourteen Sydney pubs. He’d fill
Himself with alcohol, then hurry forth
And thieve, or rob a bank or burst a till.
I recollect as clearly as can be
The night we took the lad to “Sunny Spain—
A modern and instructive film.” We hoped
That it might do Bill’s morals good. In vain.
On getting home he briskly seized an axe
And brained our harmless housemaid, Mary Jane.
He gambled at the races recklessly:
His face grew furtive, hard, and heavy-browed;
He went to fights, and, when his man got licked,
Bill cursed the vanquished heartily and loud.
He also robbed a church or two, and forged ;
And finally he joined the Labor crowd.
Mayhap the Angel Child of melodrame
Would pass unscathed from a picture show:
The Kid of Adams might not be transformed
From wondrous Goodness into something Low.
I lay no universal doctrine down:
I only write of Bill, whereof I know.

Miss Trevor plays the part of Mary Rolfe in “The
Woman in the Case.” “I have played it for over 300
nights in London and the English provinces,” she ex-
plined, “and I am certain the piece, will make an
enormous hit here. The women rave about it. I
have to cry all night, and I can tell you it takes
every ounce out of me.” —Evening paper.
Tears spoil a pretty woman’s looks,
And all her make-up smear;
But in sad plays and sodden books
Grief earns much cheese and beer.
Grief is the hobby—nothing more—
Of human crocodiles
Who over actors weep and roar,
But watch men starve with smiles.
Long, long ago, big shameless tears
Were shed by ev’ry gent;
They hall-marked in those bygone years
The man of sentiment.
Men blubbered at a fearful rate,
And to their loves did kneel;
But now that pose is out of date —
All men are made of steel.
Thus, nowadays, not brave enough
To cry in street or hall,
Men pay to hear some written guff
And snivel in a stall.
But not a woman cares a blow
Who sees her sob and sniff;
She loves to get her tears to flow
And damp her handkerchief.
It proves to all she has “a heart,”
And gives her much relief;
With food and drink she’d rather part
Than with the joy of ‘Grief.
Hooray for Grief, the luxury
And source Of revenue! . . .
Come, smiling wife, and hurry tea
For I nave seats for two!

Fat’s press and other claqueurs often sug-
gest that the real reason why some men go on
strike is that they may have more time to get
drunk. During the current trouble at Renrnark
(S. A.) a bull’s-eye answer has been given to that
yarn. Ordinarily the strikers haven’t got any
control over the beer-weapons, and couldn’t spike
them if they wanted to; but at Renrnark
the one and only pub is owned by the people
and managed by an elected committee, on
which, as it happens, the Labor people
are in the majority. As soon as the strike began
the committee met, reckoned up that there was
every prospect of a long struggle, and decided
that, in the interests of the community, the liar
should be shut. And as there wasn’t any Mr.
Bung depending upon it for fat profits, shut it
was, and shut it has remained.

Melbourne City Council’s unwillingness to
license the taxi-cabs for “rank” purposes and fix
their scale of charges—which unwillingnesssmells
of jobbery and corruption—was a matter of more
than local interest last week. The Melbourne
Cabmen’s Union had a row with the inter-State
steamship owners, and passengers landing at
Melbourne found the wharves cabless. Also, as
many of them as took a taxi in default of a cab
found, to their sorrow, that the motor-power
vehicle was unlicensed and horribly expensive.
Seemingly, the City Council’s policy is to keep
the taxi horribly expensive until the public wakes
up and does some violent kicking in the right
place.

“ Curlie ” : Victor Daley’s “Ballad of
Eureka” (B. 19/1/T1) struck me as one of his best.
Having read it, and being only a couple of hundred
yards away from the Ballarat Old Cemetery,
where lie the remains of soldiers
and diggers, I took the poem
with me to the spot. The
soldiers’grave is ornamented by
a monument, erected in 1879 by
“The Government of Victoria,”
at the request of the citizens of
Ballarat, and kept in splendid
order by, I expect, State funds.
The diggers’ monument, insignifi-
cant in size, although more classic
in design, was the gift of a towns-
man of Geelong, James Leggat,
in 185 G ; and the monument and
grave presented in their state of
neglect a marked contrast to the
other. But that is to be changed
now; for James Oddie has capped
his other gifts by leaving a sum
to keep the plot in order for all
time. Whilst I was decipher-
ing the names on the stone and
noting Daley’s accuracy in regard
to details, Young Australia, in
the person of two happy-go-lucky
ragamuffins passed whistling
along the cemetery path. They
were evidently going rabbiting;
for one proudly carried his ferret
in a box slung from his shoulder,
whilst the other kept a watchful
eye on a pert-looking fox-terrier.
They either knew or cared
nothing (let us hope the former) about Eureka—
their country’s first and, up to the present, only
battlefield.
The Wellington (M.L.) Wharf Laborers’
Union lias been punched by a heavy legal decision
which will warn unions to be careful how they
handle defaulters. One Flowers joined in
190 G, at a time when preference to unionists
had not been granted, and, some time later,
having failed to keep up his payments, was
struck off the books. In March, 1908, pre-
ference was granted, and the employers of
Flowers were notified that his continued
employment meant a breach of the award.
So Flowers handed up 3s. 6d.—2s. 6d.
as a new entrance fee, and Is. as a month’s
subscription. The union closed on the
money, claimed it as part payment of
arrears, and left Flowers at work as a
unionist. In April, 1910, employers of
wharf labor were again given notice that
Flowers was a non-unionist. Flowers
then made his second move. He ap-
pealed to the Supreme Court for a man-
damus to compel the union to recognise him
as a member, an injunction restraining it
from representing him as a non-unionist
and £175 damages for loss of employment.
Justice Cooper said the legal equivalent of
“Right-o,” but sheared damages down to
£5O plus the old, reliable Costs. He
figured it that the 3s. Gd. handed up by
Flowers in 1908 was for new membership,
and should have been viewed in that light
by the union ; and as the plaintiff had not
been 12 months in arrears since that date,
he was ipso facto (also ipso jure and
the rest of the family) fully entitled to
the privileges of membership. So Flowers
comes out with flying petals. He doesn’t
have to pay up his old arrears, he is
enrolled as a new member, he hands his
bill for Horsehair to the union, and lands
hpme with £49 19s. in his pocket and two
drinks in Ins digestion. Meanwhile the
union will stay home o’ nights and think
out a less expensive way of catching its
defaulters.
“ Aeneas B.”: The sputter of excitement
caused in Melbourne by the appearance of
the harem skirt diverted attention from
another Collins-street attraction. A photo-
grapher, pushinga special line of wedding pictures,
exhibited a collection of these sad groups. In the
same window hung a card bearing the artless
legend—“ Wanted, a boy.”
The agitated Maorilander has broken out
in a fresh place, and when the mail left was shak-
ing his brolly before the highly-colored poster-
pictures of “ The Bad Girl of the Family” on the
Auckland hoardings. Nobody appears to have
felt any thrill concerning this young woman’s
lithographs until the director of technical educa-
tion, the headmaster of the Grammar School, the
principal of the Training College and the head-
master of the Normal School wrote to the Mayor
concerning the pictures :
In our opinion, they are a dishonor to womanhood, and
have a demoralising influence on the young people of this
city. We think the time has come when all such pictures
should be submitted to a public censor.
The thing which jangled the educational gentle-
men’s modesty the most depicted several girls in
nighties attacking a couple of policemen who had
entered their dormitory to arrest the Bad
Girl. Upon publication of the letter, inhabit-
ants who had looked at the picture hundreds
of times without seeing anything suggestive or
unusual in it, hurried to the nearest hoard-
ing to have another look ; newspapers gravelv
discussed the matter without venturing ail
opinion; the town clerk was interviewed and
declared that, had he been poster censor, the
pictures would have been passed without hesita-
tion ; and the Wowser was left flapping his ears
preparatory to another upward bound. A re-
markable person is the Maorilander—or some of
him ; a queer cuss who periodically throws his
morality on the counter presumably to prove that
it has not been pickled in sly grog.
* * * *
“ Paroa ” : The Maoris have another
legend besides that given by “Konini” concern-
ing the famous fish, Felorus Jack. It was
given me on the authority of a Nelson (M.L.)
chief thus :
A northern rangatira on a visit to a South Island pa
became enamored of a dusky maiden, who was just as
willing. Unfortunately, father stepped in and ordered
the bloke away ; but he continued to hang round till all
his followers died or deserted and his canoe rotted to
pieces. At last the gods took pity on the lovers and gave
to each the shape and qualifications of a fish, where-
upon they shook the sand from their tails and
departed for many years of salt-water bliss. At last
the fish-lady died. The fish-gentleman, in his great grief,
decided that he would live alone in a cave in Pelortis
Sound, and in time became known to the pakeha as
Pelorus Jack.
I don’t vouch for the yarn myself; but my canni-
bal friend says he’ll wager te hogshead of beer it
te fac’.

London papers announce that whiskers
are coming ih. Already the smartest young men
of the smartest set are exhibiting luxuriant face-
fur. No doubt this is man’s answer to the trouser-
ette. Coats go with the harem skirt, and the
advanced women openly declare that these are
only the beginning of a complete rational costume
for the sex. So, almost unconsciously, man falls
back upon his sacred whiskers as the one adorn-
ment that piratical woman cannot parody.
Heaven alone knows, though, how soon it will be
before the world is resounding to the shriek of the
still revolting sex. shaking Heaven with a new
shibboleth, “ Whiskers for women ! ”

THOUGHTS FOR GEORGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The majority of girls give little consideration to their
capacity for making their future husbands happy. Some-
thing more than love may be necessary to the comfort of
the home. —Daily paper.
When that my love forgetteth oft to shave,
The thorny prickles of his manly cheek
Fill me with longing his dear soul to save
From boarding-houses bleak.
The beef on which they foster him is tough,
The gravy hath much grease about the brim ;
How shall my fingers white delight to stuff
The juicy duck for him !
To brown the singing rooster, grill the chop
In days to come shall be my wifely pride ;
To build f lir things with beaten egg a-top,
Each like a veilbd bride.
My love is never exquisite in dress ;
I fain would minister to nil his wants.
Whiten his cloudy cuffs, and learn to press
Ilis rather baggy pants.
For him at steaming washtuhs would I stand,
Soothing the weekly stains of toil and care ;
Chastening his singlet and his collar-band,
Fit for my king to wear.
He shall have towels always in their place.
What time ho cometh from his daily toil ;
And water for the harvest of his face
Shall still be on the boil.
Beer shall he have, if he desireth beer ;
And if he howleth curses down the stairs,
His words shall fall as music on mine ear—
Sweet as the drone of prayers.
DrUnk and rebellious, I shall love him more ;
Solemn and dull, I shall not love him less ;
The raucous cadence of his midnight snore
Shall still have power to bless.
So shall the happy days to music run,
And gentle service shall be all my pride ;
And thus I wait in meekness to be won
And made mj’ George’s bride.

The calm of an eminently expensive Mel-
bourne restaurant was disturbed on a recent race
night. Dinner was in progress, nothing was
heard but the clamor of the lucky bookmakers
biting their soup, when the detached woman
entered the room. She was tall, quietly dressed,
and had all the lady-like affectations dear to
reporters. She looked round, then stood by one
table, gazing calmly at two diners. The diners
were male and female. Their attitude was in
marked contrast to the composed demeanor of the
spectator. They presented all the symptoms of
guilty wretches in the face of righteous retribu-
tion. The woman went on looking down at them.
She did not speak, she betrayed no feeling, and
the situation was painfully strained, when the
elegant minister for internal affairs came up
anxiously, and laid a hand on her shoulder. “My
dear, good lady,” he expostulated. The scrutineer
addressed him very sweetly, but in clear, pene-
trating tones. “ Please, do not interfere,’ she
said. “I am going. I merely wished to see how
my clothes looked on that woman with my hus-
band ! ” Then she turned and walked forth,
leaving two miserable wretches making ineffectual
attempts to hide themselves in oyster shells.

Seemingly the “Little Mary ” grovel, for
the purpose of adding Coronation gifts to the
Queen’s hoard of superfluities, has been frost-
bitten all over the empire whereon the sun never
sets. A cable from London last week announced
that the date for emptying the collection-plate
had been postponed to the end of May, and the
name of Miriam had been added to the list of
those fortunate females who are related by wet-
baptism and dry-registration to King George’s
wife. The extra time and the extra name suggest
frantic efforts to raise a few more shillings. The
next cablegram on the subject will probably state
that Martha has been added to the list, because
Martha was “ the sister of Mary” and was much
concerned about many things. And how about
Maudie, Minnie and Mamie ? Can’t they be
called upon in the Queen’s name to push the
concern ?

The wreck of the Yongala makes the third
very bad disaster on the Queensland coast; the
other victims were the Quetta and the Gothen-
burg. Over 100 lives were lost with each of these
three. The trouble came to the Gothenburg on
February 24, 1875. Among those who were
drowned then were several well-known South Aus-
tralians returning from the Northern Territory—
Judge Wearing, ex-Premier Reynolds, Crown
Prosecutor Whitby, and others. About 30 of the
passengers were saved, mainly through the intre-
pidity of Jack Cleland and Fitzgerald, the former
of whom still lives in the Territory. The vessel
met such just such a storm as that which proved
fatal to the Yongala, which, by the way, derived
her name from a South Australian farming town
on the northern railway line. In the Gothenburg
wreck the then Resident of the Territory lost his
wife and six children.

Some shocking persons,
it seems, have been rude to chose
fine men who have taken on jobs
at the various Victorian im-
plement works where the
regular toilers are on strike.
Some of the rudest people,
it appears, have called
these fine men “scabs ”
and “blacklegs,” and
the Melbourne press
is horrified, and says
that something violent
ought to be done.

day, referring to the
execution of a French
hooligan, even hinted
that it would be a
good thing to treat
some of the Melbourne
strike sympathisers the
same way. lam going
to try an experiment
when the Jap invasion
comes along. When all
the other Australians go
on strike against them, I
will hurry to the daily
paper offices and tell them
that it is a glorious thing
to go over to the other side,
as it shows that I have
some of that grand independ-
ence of my forefathers ; and
I will add that I will not be
forced to join the Australian
army, even if it is fighting
on my behalf. Of course, the
daily won’t call me a “scab,”
or a blackleg, or a dastardly rebel,
or a traitor ; but it will shake my
hand, pat my curly hair, and re-
mark that I am a splendid example
of independent thought and a brave
fellow for refusing to be coerced into
fighting for my brothers.
The S. M. Herald lately published a letter
over the name of Caroline Grosvenor on “The
Shortage of Domestics ”: —
There is, however, luckily for Australia, another large
class of women in England from which it is possible, under
certain conditions, to obtain the much-needed help.
Many of the better-educated women of a superior class
are now forced to earn their living. These are thoroughly
trained in all branches of domestic work, and are quite
willing to undertake such work in the overseas dominions,
where no stigma attaches to honest work of any kind.
This is Australia’s salvation right enough. But
what a nasty thing to say about the Dear Old
Home—that it is a reproach there to do honest
work !

“The Shover”: Recently I attended a
Labor meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall. I
was late in arriving—just half an
hour before the proceedings were due
to start —but at length managed to
squeeze in between two pipes of the
grand organ. Next day, the Mel-
bourne press coldly remarked that
“ Mr. Fisher had no reason to be dis-
satisfied with the attendance.”
Another night I went to a “ m< nuer
meeting” of Laborites at the Ex-
hibition Building. To save space
chairs had been suppressed, and
four people were sardined where
at the Town Hall meeting only
one enthusiast had sat. Those on
the outskirts were so far from the
speakers that theycould hearnothing
The account given next day spnte
slightingly of a mere 5000 people !
Later on I attended the formation
of a branch of the “Commonwealth
Liberal Party.” There was a dog
on the door-step, and one or two
agents inside the large and gloomy
hall ; also a brace of reporters, and
a dispirited chairman. Next day’s
Aegus referred to the meeting as a
well-attended and satisfactory gather-
ing, indicative of the state of public feel-
ing. Somehow, I almost begin to suspect
these Melbourne journals of one-sidedness,
or misrepresentation, or defective eyesight,
or something.
Paris House, the expensive manger to
which Sydney’s young man goes when he feels
unusually affluent or unusually flighty, has taken
over the neighboring pub-property on the King-
Castlereagh street corner; and indue course, rio
doubt, the young man will be a devil of a fellow there.
In Svdnev’s early days the corner was put to quite a
different use. On it was the school and residence
of Mr. Cape, who whipped the three R’s into quite
half of the public men who flourished in Sydney a
generation ago. Later on The Three Tuns public-
house arrived, engineered by another distinguished
colonist, Richard Driver, for years a big man in
the city, and father of Dick Driver, a well-known
sporting solicitor. * *
The Law is slowly realising its responsi-
bilities to accused persons. The other day it
abolished the spiked and barred dock in Mel-
bourne’s Criminal Court, and substituted a sort of
wooden pew, not quite as luxurious as the benches
of the House of Fat, yet still mueh less uncom-
fortable than the press form or the jury-box.
When juries were instituted, the Law seems to
have suffered from the idea that they were as
antagonistic to society as the criminal, and placed
them in much the same sort of a den, and it
hasn’t improved their position since; but it has
gradually dawned on Authority that the criminal
really is necessary, and that if there weren’t any
criminals there would he a lot of officials out of a
job. Consequently it is laying itself out to be
affable to that animal. But jurymen still don’t
count; the Law thinks it could get along very
well without them.

At Alfred Deakin’s State Frights meeting
in Adelaide the people who were running the
patter show had the gall to sing, as a prelude,
“The Song of Australia,” which S. Australia
regards as the Commonwealth National Anthem.
The printed programmes scattered through the
hall contained the words, in case anybody shouldn t
know what the rest were bellowing ; and when
the last “Australia” had been sung, Alfred got
up and kicked the whole spirit of the thing to
fragments. Obviously, if the State Frighters will
sing “ The Song of Australia ” at their meetings,
it ought to be in a revised version. For instance :
This is a land where feeble lies,
Stained with the good old Tory dyes,
Vain efforts make to harmonise—to harmonise.
On ev’ry stump and platform bright
Each “ Liberal ” and wild State Fright,
Like large mosquitoes, buzz and bite
Australia, Australia, Australia.
This is a land where drivel flows,
And where the mortgage swiftly grows,
Land of the Pawnshop and the Nose—our
Uncle’s Nose.
On hill and plain the evil sign
Is hanging over yours and mine,
To keep it there two “ Noes” entwine,
Australia, Australia, Australia.
This is a land from whose white throat
The hands of Death are not remote
You must not wound it with your vote, your
two-edged vote.
Heed not the fool nor his address,
Equip your nation for the stress
By marking down a double “ Yes,”
Australia! Australia, Australia!

The Oldest Inhabitant remembers another
Oldest Pub :
The White Hart Hotel, a landmark on the corner of
TSourke and Spring streets, Melbourne, the resort of Par-
is unentarians for over half a century, was offered at
auction sale a day or two ago. The origina l White
Hart dates back long anterior to the building of Pailia-
ment Houses, when scrub prevailed between the top of
Bourke-street and Newtown, as Oolhngwood was then
named. The original owner of the Spring-street frontage
from Little Collins-street to Bourke-street was Mr. r. L.
pqmnhell who was police magistrate at Maitland
(N.S.W.) at the time he purchased. In the first ’:>o’s the
occupier of the old inn was R. N. Coleman, who had for
next-door neighbor “Jimmy” Ellis, formerly of Cre-
morne Gardens, London, and afterwards manager
of the Cremorne Gardens, on the Yarra, for George
Goppin The Amphitheatre had not then been
built bv Mr. G. B. W. Lewis on the site now
occupied by the Princess’s Theatre. Next door to the mn
in Bourke-street was John Cray, “cab proprietor, though
Melbourne’s first hansom hadn’t then arrived to stand on
the rank in front of Scott’s Hotel. Next to Cray was a
saddler named Bullock, whose shop was very soon to be
occupied hv Henry Tolman Dwight, an asthmatic book-
seller who had an immense stock, chiefly second-hand.
Outside was a man in spectacles, who constantly cried :
“ Books, books ; buy, buy ! ” When Mr. Dwight died in
1872 his stock numbered 35,000 volumes, and Cohen and
Co. took 14 days to sell the'4soo lots.
“Ex-Papuan ” : “The expedition cost.the
lives of 17 natives, who perished either by starva-
tion or drowning.” Such is the news we get from
Thursday Island concerning the latest Papuan
expedition. Yet no white man died either from
too little food or too much water. If the captain
of a ship loses part of his crew by starvation or
drowning, he has to explain the matter before the
Admiralty or the Marine Board ; and what is
sauce for the water-fowl ought to be sauce
for the land-fowl. Among other things, we
should know the terms on which the natives went
on the expedition, and whether the relatives of
those who perished are to get any compensation
for the loss of their bread-winners, or are to be
just left to console themselves with the thought
that the white man neither starves nor drowns,
while 17 of his native mates and trustworthy ser-
vants go to their deaths.

“ Billy Beerseeker,” from the Cows :
The local dairy cookies, despite their inborn conser-
vatism and aversion to all change which they can’t bank
look with a kindly eve on the harem skirt. What appeals
to their practical minds is the utility of this latest craze
in feminine garments. It is a rational cow-yard dress ;
Arrayed in it, Jinny will be Jimmy’s equal, not only at
“ bailing up,” but at holding the milk-bucket between t he
knees, and in following the harrowing team in the culti-
vation plot. Jinny long ago annexed Jimmy’s headgear
for out-door exercise ; now she is being persuaded to go
after his leg-gear also. And from the divided skirt to
dungarees will be a short stride for the emancipated
limbs.

Melbourne Age talks truth on the liquor
question :
In Victoria the Sons of Temperance complain that their
young recruits are falling off. Yet public opinion in favor
of temperance is on the increase. ,
Popular sentiment was lately voiced by a keen-
witted Melbourne barmaid, who has been in the
business many years: “Don’t worry about the
Drink Evil. It is curing itself.” If Sons were
not taking to Temperance without signing any
pledge, there would be more force at the back of
the demand made by the latest local missioner—
one Dr. Henry—for stronger legislation. But,
as a matter of fact, Intemperance is the bottom
dog nowadays, and if the Law stayts to kick it
when it’s down. Temperance is liable to turn round
and take its part.

Cheering news item from Queensland :
In the Brisbane Oitv Summons Court to-day John
Chappel, laborer, was fined £2 for expectorating on the
footpath. Defendant was allowed 30 days to pay the
fine, in default 14 days’ gaol.
If everyone who spat on a Sydney or Melbourne
footpath were dealt with on similar lines,
McGowen and Murray would be able for a while
to spurn the pawnbroker, and the dissemination
of consumption and other loathsome and fatal
diseases would be decreased by about 50 per cent.
The N.S.W. and Vic. police authorities might
desist from their untiring pursuit of two-uppers,
and give this matter a moment’s thought.

THE CHILTERN “TIGER.”
Chiltern, Monday.—The tiger scare has
now subsided through the exertions of
Constable Carruthers. Barnawartha. The
tracks which helped to alarm the forest
worker were followed to Mr T. Doolan’s
estate, where a large dog—a cross be-
tween mastiff, staghound and pointer,
striped very much like a tiger—was dis-
covered. The huge animal is noted as
the best fox killer in the district. _

Spoons Forks.
We are showing a window full of nothing but Spoons and Forks in
Cabinets and Cases this week.
We do Spoons and Forks better than any house in Australia—the best
qualities onlv.
We simply take the English Wholesale Catalogues of the leading great
makers, and take off 20 per cent, from their catalogue prices.
It only gives us a broker’s commission, but our great output makes it
pay us, and of course it is a great advertisement for
us to have our goods on the table at every meal.
We guarantee every Spoon we sell to be good after 20
years’ daily wear. Each base is made of white bard
nickel silver, and is then triple-plated.
The models are the acme of elegance.
The range of designs bewildering.
KNIVES— SteeI Table and Dessert sizes, and carvers
and steels we are doing equally well.
It’s an evolutionary experiment, but we think it will
pan out all right—certainly it will for the buyers
of Spoons and Forks.
Table Spoons and Forks—
Best quality, 36/- ; less 20%, 28/10 per dozen.
Dessert Spoons and Forks—
Best quality, 28/-; less 20%, 22/6 per dozen.
Tea Spoons—

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER FACES.
TRAVELLER: “ Can you tell me how far it is to Booblekyne?"
JACKY: “ Oh, yes, boss. Berry long way you walk. Him not so far you ride. Drive
him Mr. McKay's pair and buggy, no plurry distance at all."
“Sapphire Smith”: On sunny days the
fish that walks may often be seen taking his consti-
tutional on the mud flats beside the Cairns ' (Q.)
wharves. He varies from 4in. to Bin. in length;
tapers cigar-like from a very bluff head to the place
where he leaves off; is dark brown in color, al-
though I have a suspicion the complexion is alter-
able to accord with the surroundings; and has ab-
normally large eyes standing out like boot-buttons
from a steep frontal bone. Progress over the slush
is accomplished with the aid of two stiff-looking fins,
apparently reinforced with fine cartilage, set close up
to the head. At the least motion on the watcher’s
part, the beast executes a bewildering series of aban-
doned handsprings, finally landing in the nearest pot-
hole, and burying himself in the silt. I don’t know
what his endurance record is for staying out of the
wet, but probably he returns as soon as he finds he
is getting dry feet.
“Saladin” on a national habit: —
We had been talking of some costly “shouts,”
when someone recalled that Jack Gray, of Gray s
Find” (W.A.), set ’em up at the cost of £lOO the
day the stamps dropped on his first crushing. Inci-
dentally, it was stated that the same Jack, who
had handled over £60,000 from the Find, was back
on scratch again. A Bananalander, who told of the
royal “shouts” of the squatters in Central Queens-
land at the time the Canadian Borers were striking
artesian water, declared it to be an open question
which flowed the more freely—the water from the
bore at Barcaldine, or the liquor in the township.
Then there was the celebrated “shout” at Strike-
me-Blind, once a flourishing little township on the
W A Goldfields. There were two rag-and-bag
shanties in the place, doing a roaring business, while
awaiting the erection of permanent buildings on the
main street of the town site. Permission was given by
the warden that the new pubs should be opened on
New Year’s Day, but on the New Year s Eve, when
he arrived on a visit of inspection, a few of the
bovs put it to him that the occasion was worthy
of throwing onen the new bars, which were already
stocked, at once. At the thirteenth whisky he
agreed, and things hummed. For some time there
had been bad blood between the two pubkcans, and
some of the jokers set out to make the peace be-
tween them. Rollins, being told that Keegan spoke
very well of him, and was anxious to make it up,
promptly gathered all hands and marched to Kee-
gan’s pub. “Let the boys have some wine,” he
said smiting the counter; “and it’s champagne I
mean, Mr. Keegan.” And it was. Case after case
was split °P en - all han< l s mopping it up out of
mugs, and glasses, and pint pots, and Jack -Sheas,
and some of them out of bottles. Men who had
never previously tasted champagne—and who prob-
ably never have tasted it since—had a skinful that
night. In the thick of the guzzle Keegan sprang
on the counter and called for silence. “Boys,” he
announced. “I’m taking me frind the warden up to
Jerry Rollins’s, and I want yez all to come wid us,
and have wan more or so before the old year be
forgotten.” By daylight there wasn't a of
sparkle left in either pub, and a cyclist had to be
sent along the track to meet the teams, broach a
case of wine, and bring in a few bottles to fix up
the warden, so that he could preside over his Court.
All the auditors in the West could not have
straightened the accounts between Rollins and
Keegan, so they agreed to call it quits.

“Leo Lear” : Afraid I can’t elucidate for
“James Pannikin” (B. 9/3/’ll), the reason for the
sheep man’s sense of the beautiful being above that
of the gent who farms the horned animal; but such
an expert on bush hospitality as “J. Pan.” should
have discovered that gardens and hospitality usually
run together. Approach a station selection or humpy
that possesses a garden, and you need have no qualms
on enquiring within for tucker or a bunk. The
heart-rending job of running a garden without a water
supply no doubt accounts for many a barren home-
stead environment; still the bush home that has not
a geranium or honeysuckle on the premises is a
rarity. Incidentally, I would place these two an easy
first as the most common and widely-grown flowers
Outback.
“Curse o’ Moses”: “Waipuna’s” notion
(B. 2/3/’ll) that white clover will exercise a
check on the egg-depositing extravagances of the
blue-bottle buzzer may be all right north of Auck-
land ; but it is all wrong in the wilds of inland Nel-
son and Westland (M.L.). Nothing is of any use
against the pest except darkness. The sizzling hor-
rors will not operate to any extent after the light
goes out; but the man who dared to wear a button-
hole of white clover, in order to protect his hat
from insult, would be merely offering defiance to
tne enemy. The blowfly is a bird with whom it is
policy to keep on good terms. Treat him trucu-
lently, and nothing about your camp, from a cellu-
loid collar to a crowbar, is safe. Should you de-
cide on war, however, use burning sulphur. For
anyone who likes the scent it is admirable; but you
must catch the flies to administer it.
LEFT HIM IN THE LURCH.
WAYBACK PARSON. (consolingly): “ It’s very gratifying indeed, Mr. Grabbit, to hear you
speak so movingly of the demise of your dear wife. You must indeed miss her."
GRABBIT: “Miss ’er! Miss ’er ! Cast yer eye over them crops waitin' ter be cut, an'
them poddy calves s ingin' out ter be fed, an that fence wot wants mendin', an'
that wood'cap to be cut—an' 'er goin' orf of a sudden on top of it all! She might
’ave ’ung on till after Harvestin', anyhow."
“Kola”: “Stickpicker” (B. 20/311), in
his remarks about the carryings-on of a wasp and a
large spider, casts an unwarranted aspersion on the
lady wasp’s character. He says he has noticed her
occasionally “dragging the spider home, either very
weak or very sozzled.” But it was a different spider
each time. And she had previously stung him, which
accounts for his “sozzled” appearance. When she got
him home she packed him away, after depositing an
egg in his body. There, not quite dead, and yet
hardly alive, the spider will lie until the . egg is
hatched. The young wasp will then proceed to use
the spider as a lunch-basket, and eventually nothing
but the skin will be left. By that time the young
wasp will 'be able to go out into the world and hustle
for himself.
* * * *
“Leo Lear”: So all this howl against the
cocky petered out like a dry storm in a drought, and
the maligned citizen can hold up his head in the
land and open his mouth without being condemned as
a stray devil. Now that the attack has expended
itself, he can step out into the open, hoist his flag on
the roof of the silo, and to the applause of his own
separator, winnower, harvester, or eornsheller engine,
proclaim his virtues as under: —
(1) That he is an indispensable adjunct to the
prosperity of Australia. .
(2) That early in life he blesses himself with a
wife, and rears more young Australians per acre than
any of his traducers.
(3) That he puts in more solid graft per day than
the next man, and solid graft is a valuable asset in
opening a country.
(4) That he turns a desert into an orchard and a
sheep-walk into a wheat-field.
(5) That his freights pay for most things above .
axle-grease on the railways.
(6) That a life of hard beds, hard graft and hard
tucker is moulding him into a defender Australia
will be glad of in the day of trouble.
“Sleepy Dick”: Re par. in “Aboriginali-
ties” (B. 16/3/’ll) in which “Arsemo” asks for in-
formation concerning jungle fowl. The bird is pro-
bably the lowan, or mallee hen, as it is named by
most bushmen. Have seen one of their nests in the
Swan Hill mallee (Vic.) sft. high, about 30ft. in
diameter at the ground level, and conical in shape.
The nest is chiefly composed of sand, with a few de-
cayed leaves in the centre where the eggs are placed.
When pioneering, in 1894, I visited the nest in ques-
tion once a week for three months, and gathered on an
average four eggs per visit. The remarkable thing
about the nests is that there is no evidence of the
sand being taken from anywhere in the vicinity.
How do they get it there ?
“Jack Jay”: “Hamer” (B. 2/3/’ll) runs
foul of the theory of the scientist (wasn t it
Macmillan Brown?) who laid it down that the
Maori will be absorbed in the white race. Though
I had pretty well accepted the Mac-Brown theory
on personal experience, “Hamer’s” statements made
me sit up and put a wet towel round my head,
After thinking of 10 families with the touch of the
tarbrush in them, I took off the towel. Not one
case could I place of reversion towards Maori where
male or female half-caste had married a white,
Young Maoris are certainly more European-looking
than the elders, probably from the fact that, until
the last 15 or 20 years, there was considerable in-
troduction of white blood to the Kiangas. Now,
whose experience gives the rule? “Bob B.” tells
me the Maori wahine’s well-known hip-waddle is
always visible in her half- or quarter-caste descend-
ants on the female side. Haven’t yet investigated lo-
cally, but doubt it. I know a very nice quarter-
caste; but if she waddles like gran ma 111 have
to reconsider the position,

WHEN THE PUMPRING BLGOM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In summer—dusty, dried-up, good, old, blazing
summer-time—
Oh, see the fatted pumpkins, blooming in their
summer prime!
The pigs may pine for skim-milk, and the cows may
nose for grass
Where frequent, fatted grasshoppers the care-free
moments pass ;
But there’s a good time coming when, in autumn,
once again
The bulging, bloated pumpkins show they have not
bloomed in vain.
What though the spring-cart come to grief upon its
rocky trip
For tucker from the township—let the blanky tucker
rip !
Although the larder's getting bare, and presently we
see
Our bacon’s running out; although in winter-time,
maybe,
The weekly butcher’s bushed, or blocked by roaring
creeks aflood,
We see good tucker clear ahead when all the pump-
kins bud.
When, later in the season, there is little left to eat,
Since father’s sold the goat and some financier owns
the wheat,
And prime, unpoisoned rabbit’s scarce, and ’pos-
sum’s overdone ;
When all the roosters silently have vanished one by
one,
And every blessed pullet has refused to play the
game,
Ripe pumpkin, always on the spot, comes forward
just the same.
Ah, when the kindly pumpkins bloom, we see new
hope ahead ;
With pumpkin-chops and pumpkin-steaks the house-
hold will be fed,
And pumpkin-soup there soon will be, and pumpkin-
pie all right,
’Twill send us whistling to our work and welcome us
at night.
We have no time for cursing, now; there is no need
for gloom. ... ;
There’s hope ahead of us, in tons, when all the
pumpkins bloom 1

An inside view of big-game hunting, as
shown in a letter from Henry Tarlton, formerly of
S. Aus., but now of Central Africa, brother of
the Tarlton who “ran” Roosevelt’s expedition there:—
We went away again last September after rhino,
buffalo, and hippo, but we only brought back two
young rhino for three months’ strenuous work. I
sold the small one for £150, and still have the big
fellow. He is said to be the largest yet caught,
and took 15 of us to handle him after I got the
rope on ... He gave a lot of trouble for about
four days, but soon got tame with those lie knew.
He broke an Indian’s leg coming through Fort
Hell —just to show how it was done . . . He is quite
tame now, and goes out grazing all day with his
koy, following like a dog . . . Leslie’s friendship
with Roosevelt has been productive of several new
clients to murder game. This big-game hunting is
a poor affair. The game does not get even a
sporting chance. All the “sportsmen” use different
calibre of cannon, and most have a white hunter
behind to take the brunt of a charge, if it should
come.
COMPLICATIONS.
“ It's insomnia I got, Henery, complicated by
snorin'. When I sleep I snore, and when
I snore I can't sleep.”
THE PESSIMISM OF FAT.
VISIT OR: “ That's a fine young crop you have.”
SQUATTER: “ Yes; but the blanky white ants is likely to get into the fencin' posts any
day now.”
“H.S.M.”: Was travelling with a friend
recently, when, just outside Scone (N.S.W.), some-
thing began to squeak, and we pulled up beside a cot-
tage to investigate. A crowd of three small young-
sters immediately collected, and looked on while my
friend poked about under the car. “Give us the
oil can,” he sang out; “there’s something wrong
with her inside.” I got the can, but it was empty ;
so I said to the oldest child, a girl of about 10
years: “Would you, like a good girl, run and ask
your mother if she could give us a little oil?” She
ran away, and returned breathlessly to say: “Please
mother hasn’t any oil, but she says if you wait a
minute she will give you some salts!”
“Penitent Form”: I wish to announce my
conversion. For years I simply laughed at The
Bulletin’s attitude towards Loans and Borrowing.
I took the side of the Herald and Telegraph. I
assiduously practised borrowing on my own account.
The following are some of my loans: —
120 half-crowns (because I left my money in my
other trousers’ pocket).
3978 shillings and sprats (for a feed).
9586 thrums (towards a feed).
20,000 browns (for tram fares).
3000 profane books.
8742 pipes of tobacco.
1,798,430 matches.
587 umbrellas.
50,000 Bulletins.
6999 drinks (stuck up in back country).
3 drinks (stuck up in Sydney).
13 bottles whisky (borrowed when barmen’s backs
were turned).
1 bottle limejuice (mistake).
But never again. I didn’t know the monster I was
playing with till the Telegraph, the whilom cham-
pion of loans, opened my eyes. On March 4, talking
about the wild animals of Egypt, it said •
In the various parts of the Anglo-Egyptian Soudan,
where loans are excessively abundant, they ap-
pear to be an unmitigated nuisance, doing much
damage yearly to domestic animals and to hoofed
game; they also kill many human beings; but, as
is the case with lives lost through crocodiles, the
native headmen seem adverse to reporting these
deaths, and the authorities are not generally in-
formed of the lives lost under these circumstances.
This dreadful intelligence has caused a reaction. I
have already handed back the bottle of limejuice to
Mr. Bung. I wish I could return some of the drinks
I borrowed west of the Darling on condition that
Bung himself had to swallow them.

“Les”: Have heard of Australians who
make pets of snakes, but have come across only one
instance of it myself. With a mate, I was travel-
ling the Northern Rivers (N.S.W.) selling jewellery
ana spectacles, and one afternoon approached a
homestead, in front of which was a luxuriant pas-
sion-fruit vine. The banquet to which we invited
ourselves was abruptly terminated by a large carpet
snake. My mate promptly rushed for a sapling.
Just as he was about to use it, an old, wrinkled
woman ran out screaming: “For God’s sake don’t
kill Emily; she’s bin with us fer three years.” We
made apologies, and were invited inside for a bite.
The old lady told us that her husband was dead,
that her sons were not at home much, that she had
made pets of carpet snakes, and that they were “real
company.” When the tea was poured out, I was
going to sit down on an old-fashioned arm-chair,
when the hostess loosed another shriek. “Look
out,” she cried; “don’t sit on pore Flossie.” I
promise you I didn’t, for Flo was the living image
of Em. Next instant I had slammed the lid on the
box of samples (which we had opened in hope of
trade), Jim had dived for his bowler hat, and we
stampeded for the open. Imagine the horror of
James when more snake started to climb out of his
hat. He let out one blood-curdling yell, and dropped
in his tracks. I don’t know how we got away
from that place, but four miles along the road we
heard a horse galloping behind us, and presently a
sawny, freckled youth pulled up and demanded his
mother’s snake, which he accused us of stealing.
The faithful chronicle of “Phil Random”:
“I’ll be leaving at the end of the week, Mr.
Grady,” said the youth to the cocky, ’way down on
the Murray.
“Oh, you’ll be lavin’, will you? An’ where might
you be makin’ for ?” said Grady, reproachfully.
“Well, I’m going up to Queensland,” said the
youth.
“Queensland, eh? Queensland, is it? Then ye’U
repint it, me bhoy. That’s the fust place I set me
fut whin 1 kem to Australia. And it’s there you’ll
have the flies be day and the iniskaties be night.
They’ll go in your tay and on your mait —an’ down
your troat, whollop. An’ it’s there ye’ll see the
wild horse buck. The divil a thing he’ll do at all,
whin yez straddle him, but chuck ’imself heels over
head, and slither out iv the saddle an’ bridle widout
ever disturbin’ a buckle or a sthrap. Yes, an’ it’s
there ye’ll see the straight-haired native wid the
goold ring on his finger an’ the girl tatooed on his
arm—and the divil a thing at all he does for a livin’
but toss the two pinnies, tails uppards, an’ cry ‘Bar
’em.’ And whin yez go down to the crake in the
mornin’ for a dhrink o’ water, the alligator ’ll
schnap the head off you. Queensland, is ut?”
And even after that Grady had to find another help.
“A William-Cann”
“Jimmie Pannikin” inquires (B. 9/3/’ll) why
successful cattlemen live simply, whereas sheepmen,
so soon as their bank balances disclose a bulge,
proceed to “enlarge and beautify their gardens” and
entertain “Pannikin.” My view, which is hereby
presented to my old travel-companion for what it is
worth, is that constant association with sheep has
a malign effect on the brain.
But why cite the cattle-man as typifying the
simple liver? A far more Spartan character is the
ovster-raneher. Years ago I shared a mollusc-farm
with a person who lied to me that he was “Pan-
nikin.” We came by the estate in a queer way.
This pseudo “Pannikin” found the money—l saw
him. Plagiarising the sorry hero of “A Message from
Mars,” 1 remarked firmly, significantly, but withal
quietly, “Halves.” “Pannikin’s” reply was unprint-
able. We decided, after a more or less heated dis-
cussion, to put the plunder into a shell-fish run.
Let me here digress, in order to point out that
there are features about this industry which render
it superior, as a business proposition, to any that I
have engaged in. The Land Tax is impotent to harm
it. Droughts it simply does not know. No herd of
shearers, avid for a living-wage, crowd hungrily
round the oyster baron. Extravagantly-salaried
boundary-riders are unnecessary ; also rabbit-poisoners
and their outfits, pear-eradieators, horses, machinery,
and the myriad other costly details which harass the
bucolic person, whether Out Back or Right In. The
only implements required are —(1) a bathing cos-
tume and (2) a few old rakes, which may be com-
mandered from the nearest Mongol soil tiller.
Behold, then, “Pannikin” and his fidus Achates
Gann, settled in their new home. Things looked
bright ahead. Away beneath the limpid waters
stretched our estate, alive with the luscious fodder
which was destined, as “Pannikin” put it, to bring
“profit to the primary producer and ptomaine-poison-
iiig to Peer and Pug promisculously.” It seemed as
though we were in a fair way to become Bivalve
Emperors. Did we attempt to live like sheep-men?
Did wfe even build ourselves such a dwelling as might
satisfy a cattle king? No; we built nothing. On
the whole of that vast property not so much as a
lean-to shed was to be seen. Our homestead was the
local pub. It was also our club, our theatre, our
banquetting hall and our salon. The back yard was
our stadium; the verandah our debating hall. How,
after several halcyon weeks, I discovered that “Pan-
nikin” was privily hypothecating the stock and in-
vesting the proceeds in beer; how he simultaneously
found that I had mortgaged our land, or, rather,
mud, in seven different places for a similar purpose;
how our genial host essayed to foreclose on the run
in a last desperate effort to connect with our board-
money ; how he was frustrated by a horde of credi-
tors, whose claims, if not wholly sound, were, at
least, less shadowy than his; above all, how James
and I fled the scene in disorder, are matters I pro-
pose to handle at some future date. My present ob-
ject is solely to insist that, as regards stern,
Diogenes-like simplicity of life, even the cattle-raiser
must give place to the hardy pioneer who dares to
blaze the track in the oyster-raising line. I have
been there and I know.
HE WAS WET ENOUGH.
S OAKED HURBY: “ Bin to a fire , m' dear
(hie) —terrible fire.”
THE WIFE: “ Did you put it out?”
“Manuka” : I wish to get my stroke in, anil
disagree with “Kowhai” (B. 5/l/’ll) and “Uncle
Jim” (B. 9/2/’ll) on the toiling ability of Jack
Maori. Years of experience of him satisfies me that
he is a good worker. He excels as a bushman; and
he provides the champion shearers of Hawkes Bay and
the boss timber cutters of North Auckland. But
while I disagree with “Uncle Jim” about the men,
I extend the glad hand to him in regard to the
chastity of the women. Any Aboliar who wishes to
disagree with us, is welcome to free board and lodg-
ing in my camp for a month to get a first-hand view
of things. I think he would be eating his lie for
breakfast on the 29tli day.
“FROG WINE.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When saddled are the trusty nags,
An’ squared the ration bill,
Good-bye said sadly to the booze,
To Fred, Jack, Ned an’ Bill,
With ’ead grog-thick an’ burstin’ ’ot,
With breath ter kill a dog,
Ye camp beside a stinkin’ ’ole
An’ drink the wine called “frog.”
Good things must ’ave an end, fer now
Ye’ve done a big cheque in
Ye swelter in the lonely bush
An’ scratch like ’ell fer tin ;
Gone square-faced gin an’ o.p. rum
Which set the town agog,
But on a stagnant billabong
The booze is wine called “frog.”
It’s blazin’ ’ot an’ damper time,
Since dawn ye’ve cursed an toiled.
Ye guess ye need a drop o’ tea,
The billy must be boiled;
Ye push the reeds an’ grass aside
An’ dip beneath a log—
Green slime, mud, insects, rancid froth;
This is the wine called “frog.”
Ye’ve grafted like a bullock team
With shovel, dish an’ pick. ...
Great Scott, ye’ve struck a patch at last;
No more ye’ll ask fer tick!
Ye load yer crocks with bags o’ tin
An’ slowly pub ward jog;
Ye’ve got a sandy-desert thirst,
But scorn the wine called “frog.”
The frogs may croak,
The drought is broke,
Ye’ll give the bush the sack,
Fer now ye pine,
Fer drink divine,
An’ leave the last dry track;
The door’s ajar,
Ye reach the bar,
An’ order up the grog;
Ye’ll sip straight rum
Till Kingdom come,
But no more wine called “frog.”
VICTORIA.

“10-2-4,” on the latest prodigy :
Re Jacky Baldwin, of Mount Colah (N.S.W.), who was
lost in the bush the other day. I have been waiting 1 ex-
pectantly for a psean from “ Jimmie Pannikin,” “ A
William-Cann ” or one of the other congenital Abo-liars
who whoop about the endurance powers of our black
brothers. In their silence, I beg to supply a brief
panegyric myself. Here was a three-year-old white
and carefully-nurtured baby who went for 72 hours
quite without food. At an early stage he jetti-
soned his hat—and it was well-nigh hot enough, on one
of those days, to have grilled a chop by sunlight. During
most of one night rain poured. After walking 10 miles,
the astounding infant was discovered, doggedly keeping
himself alive by drinking from a bush puddle. Though
weak in the legs he was right enough in the head, and
within three hours his swollen tongue subsided, and he
was able to give a coherent account of his adventures.
How many aboriginal babies would have survived? For
my part, I am satisfied that this Baldwin infant is Arthur
Adams’s only and original Kid in masquerade. I have
never met Adams’s notorious offspring, but find it im-
possible to believe any other on earth can be so wonder-
ful.
Hans Irvine, M.H.R. for Grampians
(Vic.), who is stumping his electorate against the
Referenda proposals, threatens to sell his property
at half what it cost him if the people say “Yes” on
April 26, and get out of this accursed country.
The awful threat—which sounds something like a
draper’s bargain-sale advt. —sets one thinking
over what the accursed country has done for
Irvine. He started his career with F. W. Niven,
of Ballarat, where he learnt his trade as a litho-
printer. After serving his time he spent a few
years on a station down Bombala way ; in those
days he was a reckless young man who would ride
anything with a tail on it. Later he returned to
Ballarat, and his father bought for a few hundred
pounds a partnership for him in Niven’s business,
which then became F. W. Niven and Co. Irvine
travelled for the firm, and amongst his customers
was the late Joseph Best, of Great Western, to
whom he sold a few wine-labels occasionally.
Incidentally he realised what a fine property
Best’s vineyard was ; so he sold out of Niven’s
for more thousands than he had paid hundreds
to go in, bought the vine-leaf property, and '
settled under his own fig tree. The wine j
business boomed, and so did Irvine. Then 1
he became a mining magnate (as a side ' -,
line), and, later on, M.H.R. (also as a side |
line). And there’s scarcely a thing in the world 1
that he knows less about than his last side line.
Died the other day at North Shore, Syd-
ney, aged 79. J. W. Brooks, who was in Ballarat
when the Big Thing happened. In those far
back days he was distinguished as an amateur
actor; and. after Eureka, he took part in a per-
formance got up for the benefit of Peter Lalor.
The beneficiary brought the one arm which the
unpleasantness had left him, and returned thanks
to a crowded house.
Fleetwood Fuller, the new Governor of
Victoria, is a nephew of ex-Chancellor of the
Exchequer Hicks Beach (Lord St. Aldwyn). His
father was a devotee of coaching, hunting and
cricket until he grew too old for such vigorous
amusements. Both father and son are Christ
Church (Oxford) graduates. The father was 10
years in the Commons, and the son had been in
the same Chamber just over the same period when
he was offered the rubber-stamp billet in Aus-
tralia.
Captain William Paxton, who for years
was Port Phillip’s best-known “mud pilot,” has
finished his contract. He took to the sea early,
serving his apprenticeship aboard an East India-
man in the roving ’4o’s; but turned his back on
the British flag soon after to sail beneath the
Chilian, Spanish and United States colors in turn.
After a varied career, he settled down in Mel-
bourne, and for 30 years poked up and down the
Yarra, piloting ships of all nations. He retired
into private life some years back, and was 85
when he was beached on the Golden Shore.
Died at Mackay (Q.) the other day, Daniel
Connor —without the O’ —one of the earliest of
Central Bananaland’s pioneers. He made north
in 1857, took up Princhester station, and had a
hand in much other pioneering. He was the
second to ship wool from Rockhampton, then no
town to speak of; the Archers were the first.
Later on he welcomed A. C. Gregory when that
explorer poked in to make inquiries about the lost
or strayed Leichhardt. His own name goes down
to posterity and the day after fixed to a mountain
range and a fair-sized northern river.
“ Wilhelm,” from the Inside :
The Timks (London) was recently sold to “The Times
Publishing Company.” There is nothing in the file at
Somerset House concerning “The Times Publishing Co.,
Ltd.,” to show who are the real owners of the paper.
The shares are held by nominees, and none of the actual
proprietors are directors. As a fact, the owners of the
Times are the Harmsworths, one Kennedy Jones, and Sir
John Ellerman, of the Ellerman line of steamers. Eller-
man has the biggest number of shares. His father was
Johann Herman Ellerman, of Berlin. Kennedy Jones has
had a queer career. He started life as private secretary
to T. P. O’Connor, M.P. At the age of 46 he is capable
of buying and selling his old employer several times over,
being a director of Associated Newspapers, Ltd., and a
millionaire.
“Gwy”: Longden, the Australian engineer,
whose death in abject poverty in N’York was
mentioned in last week’s Bulletin, starved him-
self for the sake of Science, it seems. He must
have made money after leaving Australia, because
not many years ago he was worth £20,000. He
spent it all on an electrical invention, from which
he expected fame and fortune. At the last it
became with him a despairing struggle and possi-
bly a monomania. Finally, while his apparatus
was lying in a safe deposit vault, he was dying in
a garret. It is a cruel world for inventors—and
the inventor’s cruellest tyrant is usually the in-
ventor himself.
Major C. A. Wilson, for whom the Last
Post sounded a week ago, was born at Penrith
(N.S.W.) in 1838, and began to battle for the
necessary biscuit in a Sydney shipping office. He
was a pioneer member of the First Regiment of
N.S.W. Rifles (the chrysalis of the First Aus-
tralian Infantry Regiment), which was formed in
1854 ; and in 1860, when the corps was re-organ-
ised into the First Battalion Volunteer Rifles, he
got an ensign’s commission, became a captain in
the early ’7o’s, and retired a major in 1895. Inci-
dentally he was one of the first choristers of St.
Andrew’s Cathedral, Sydney, and was something
uncommonly large and whiskery in the Druids’
lodge.
Cann, M.H.R., is a brother of “Jack”
Cann, Speaker of the N.S.W. Assembly. He is
comparatively a recent arrival in Australia, and
was on strike from the Illawarra coal mines when
the last Federal general election took place.
Thinking, probably, that an election contest—
and apparently a hopeless one—was as good a
way of putting in time as any, he mounted a
bicycle and took the field. He worked his way
from town to town, and in each place the Labor
men fra,nked him on to the next. He defeated
the Fusionist, Bowden, by a large majority, to the
great surprise of everyone—including himself.
He is no orator, as Joe Cook is and Brutus was ;
but “a plain, blunt man,’’who looks after the
interests of his constituents, and takes the big
Australia side against the little Australians.
THE SIDE HE WAS ON.
MR. N ONO: “At the — ah—outset I would like
to — ah—to say that I have the interest of
the — ah—large masses at heart."
L. L. Bell, Inspector of Natives in Papua,
who accompanied Staniforth Smith on the expe-
dition that had a lot of luck not to be simply a
funeral, is a son of George Bell, of Melbourne
Argus. He was formerly shipping-clerk in
Mellwraith, McEacharn and Co.’s, and is one of
those adaptable, gritty Australians who will make
niches for themselves anywhere with a fair chance.
W. A. Redmond, J. T. Donovan and R.
Hazleton, the Irish-party delegates who are about
to travel through the Commonwealth and Maori-
land, hunting the oof-bird for the Home Rule
pot, will start at Wellington (M.L.). The trio is
expected to reach there by the direct liner
Rotorua on May 1, and will conduct 12
meetings before tapping Patrick O'Stralia in the
old place.
Dr. J. A. Beattie, who for quarter of a
century has soothed the way of the unfortunates
suffering from incurable cancer in Liverpool
Asylum (N.S.W.), takes a well-earned holiday,
and departs shortly for Europe, where he will
combine personal pleasure with the general good
—the latter mainly by a study of the latest dis-
coveries in regard to inoperative cancer, the most
dreaded phase of the dreadful disease.
A Maoriland family, the Harringtons,
drops in for a nice dry bit by the death of one
Patrick McGuire, of N’Yark. Patrick left
Galway some 50 years ago, got work on the rail-
ways, seized his opportunities by their forelocks,
and led them into his paddock to the alleged
amount of $7,000,000. John Harrington, of Den-
niston ; Barclay Harrington, of Hawera; and
Mrs. A. M. Gow, lately of a Wellington hotel,
but now of the Royal Hyde Park Hotel, Sydney,
cut most of the little lot up among them.
Alfred Tennyson Dickens, the rather un-
poetic-looking son of a famous father, is being
accepted in Britain as something of a national
hero. Since he arrived from Australia under the
clever business direction of one of the Taits, he
has been requested to dine at the expense of
numerous corporations, and in almost every pro-
vincial town he visited to lecture on his pa he has
been feted, receptioned or addressed by the mayor
and councillors. Now he has been invited to the
United States, and has been expressly “com-
manded ”to eat with President Taft. And this
is the Alf Dickens who was wont to complain that
a famous father was a heavy handicap for a man
of only second-rate ability 1
MEASURE. FOR MEASURE.
Once the Referenda are carried the only matters re-
maining for the States to have jurisdiction over will be
impure literature, diseased meat, lunatic asylums and
cemeteries.— C. G. Wade.
Australia: “ Don’t be modest , old man;
speak up if you think we've overestimated
your abilities ! "
“ Good Gracious ” : The arrogance of these
Labor people, once they get a little power ! I
note in an advertisement concerning the recent
census, the following: “By His Excellency's
Command, King O’Malley, Minister of State for
Home Affairs. God Save the King ! ” God Save
O’Malley indeed ! What next?
The casual Australian has been resting of
late, but one of her dropped into publicity re-
cently at Lang Lang (Vic.). A woman left the
Melbourne-to-Warragul train at that station for
some refreshment, and casually took her seat
again, leaving her baby in the waiting-room. She
got three or four stations away before she missed
anything. Possibly a new hat had captured her
attention.
Maoriland has just lost a link with the
past by the death, at 84, of Mrs. Sarah Jane
Williams, of Wellington. Her mother was a
sister of Kendall, the missionary to the Maoris,
who landed in 1814. Her father, Thomas Flor-
ence, surveyed the greater part of Auckland town
and once owned most of the present enormously-
valuable Queen-street, which he swapped with the
old Provincial Government for 30,000 acres of poor
country land.

“ THE MUSICIAN."
J. S. Watkins’ a portrait of Josef Kretsehmann, of
Sydney, just bought by the Sydney Art Gallery.
In N.S.W. Art Society’s current exlr-
bition is shown a portrait of Josef Kretsehmann,
painted by J. S. Watkins and entitled “The
Musician.” The canvas, which has been bought
by the trustees of the N.S.W. National Gallery,
might well have been labelled “Father Christ-
mas,” for the kindly Professor, adored by
children, beloved of his confreres, and ever ready
to give his last away, is Sydney’s Father Christ-
mas. wholly in appearance and largely in fact.
He belongs to a type of enthusiasts essentially
German, and in his old age—he verges on 75 —
works from morn to sunset all the year round
teaching music. Among his former pupils are
numbered not only many eminent amateurs but
several who have attained much distinction on
the concert platform. “ Ach ! ” exclaims this
unworldly veteran, “Vat beautiful schildren and
vat lofely minds you find among der poor ! How
aggreeable it is to teach dot leetle girl und her
brother 1 They schildren of poor storeman—he
keeps eight schildren on two-pound-five efery
week. Und dot leetle poy rnit der bright eyes—
his fader dead und his mutter work very hard to
keep her family.” And the old Professor looks
the part to the life; he is Father Christmas all
the year round.
Queensland is just now in the curious
position of having as sole Commissioner of Rail-
ways a man who didn’t have anything at all to do
with railways until he was past 65 years old.
Thallon was getting ancient, and the Bananaland
railways were growing bigger ; so the Government
a while ago appointed Auditor-General King to
be Assistant-Commissioner, the idea being that
this ex-Customs officer should look after the coni-
mercialsideof theshow. Then, within a few months,
Thallon died, leaving the new-ehum Kingthesole
Commissioner. Thallon had things pretty well
organised, however ; so for a couple of months,
while the Government is considering the situa-
tion. nothing dreadful is likely to happen—as the
result of Thallon’s departure, anyhow.
H. M. THE HOUSEHOLDER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As a householder, the King personally interested him
self on Sunday night in seeing that an accurate census
return of persons at Buckingham Palace was compiled.—
Argus (4/4/77).
Upon the back-door steps he stands,
An empty milk-jug in his hands,
And scans the stars, and breathes “ More rain ! ”
And mildly goes inside again,
And gently locks the kitchen-door,
And searches then for burglars ; for
A model householder is he . ..
That is the sort of King for me !
When burglar-drill is done he goes
To sneak a snack on stockinged toes ;
And then, remembering Tortoise-shell,
He seeks the parlor couch, for well
He knows fat Torty’s little ways.
Some kings and princes never laze,
Of household duties never tire.
That kind of King I do admire!
Within the cupboard soon he gropes
(He knows the right housekeeping ropes),
And rakes out something nice to eat,
The remnants of a favored sweet,
Cold meat, a slice of fat and lean,
A cup of coffee for his queen,
And—yes, three fingers of the best
For him, the King who's earned a rest!
Hail him, the King whose Torty-cat
Exits into the garden at
Ten-thirty sharp ! Hail him, the one
Who goes to bunk, his duty done,
Before the chimes of midnight sound !
A King whom household cares surround
I can applaud like anything !
Hail him, our own Householder-King !
VICTORIA.

For the first nine months of 1909-10 the
commonwealth net Customs revenue was £8,738 143 •
for the past nine months it was £9,856,463, an in-
crease of £1,118,320, which is about 10 times
greater than the anticipated growth. The con-
tinued great prosperity of the country and the ex-
ceeding plentifulness of money is no doubt largely
responsible for the big increase in imports, with the
consequent big increase in import duties. In many
• cases the cost of production in Australia has in-
creased very much, and, as the duty has not gone
up in proportion, the foreigner is able to undersell
the Australian producer. This shows over again the
need to put the tariff and wages boards, etc., under
the one authority. If the duty races ahead of the
rates of pay fixed by the wages boards, the manu-
facturer gets an unfair advantage over the work-
thf, wages rates, etc., race ahead of the
tariff then the workman gets an unfair advantage
over the manufacturer, and presently the orders go
°J tl , le c ? untl- y- The tariff is, and must be, in
the hands of the Commonwealth; and the purpose
of the coming Industrial Referendum is to put the
regulation of wages in the same hands.
. s - Wales on the nine months is £328,307 ahead
of the first three quarters of the previous year—
£10,549,101, as against £10,220,794. The rail-
ways continue to have a booming revenue; they are
£521,357 ahead, and tramways are £125,152 ahead,
together more than wiping out the shortage in the
subsidy which the Commonwealth pays the State.
When McGowen came into office, after the October
elections, he found that the Estimates had been
tramed (as a matter of fact, more than a fourth of
the year had passed), and he practically took them
over. They provided for a shrinkage of £1,200,000
in the revenue, due, of course, to the reduction in
the subsidy paid to the State by the Commonwealth.
As things are shaping there won’t be half that
shrinkage; so, if the expenditure had not been
bumped up, McGowen might have had a surplus of
perhaps three-quarters of a million at the end of the
year. Things stand this way at present:—
9 mos. 1909-10. 9 mos. 1910-11.
Revenue.. .. £10,220,794 £10,549,101
Expenditure .. 9,976,046 10,665,348
Surplus .. £244,748 Deficit £116^247
It is plain from this that the McGowen Government
is pouring out money fast. But as long as it
doesn t show a deficit it is all right. A tricky
financial crowd would defer expenditure, and thereby
manufacture a surplus, which it would wear as a
sort ot halo; after which it would proceed to spend
the money. In plain words, the manufacture of
surpluses is mostly a trick, and the McGowen Gov-
ernment hasn’t learned it. Unfortunately it has
learned the other trick of running to the pawnshop.
It has so far spent £2,842,164 of Cohen’s money
this year, plus £294,581 on account of railway
# sa’® 0r a total of £3,136,745 —an increase
ot it. 473,703 on the figures for the corresponding
quarters of the previous year. Inevitablv there
will be trouble by-and-bye. A handful of people
cant pour out £3,136,745 of loan money in nine
months without producing a boom, a burst of artifi-
cial prosperity; and when the borrowing stops, and
some tens of thousands of men are thrown out of
work, there is bound to be trouble.
The Victorian revenue shows an increase of
£52/,278; the total reaches £6,618,51'5. Railways
show an increase of £269,462. Expenditure re-
turns are, as usual, not forthcoming. S. Australia
shows the remarkable proportionate increase of
£321,532 ; total for nine months, £3,065,076.
The swift growth of S. Australia’s revenue is, how-
ever, partly due to land sales; and land-sale money
isn’t really revenue at all. For years there was
hardly any income from this source; with the open-
ing up of new lands, once supposed to be desert, the
total for the three quarters ran up to £193,265, as
against £95,978 for the corresponding fragment of
last year. The one fly in S. Australia’s butter is
the weak wheat market. Parcels were sold down
to 3s. the other day—and that means Is. less than
the farmers lately lined their pockets with. Some
at least of this shrinkage is due to the large in-
crease in ocean freights. Some time ago S. Aus-
tralia inquired into the local wheat-buying arrange-
ments. With more justification it might now in-
quire whether there is a shipping ring—whose
existence may indeed be taken for granted -and
what its effect has been on freights, and, conse-
quently, on the prices that shippers can afford to
pay this end.
Queensland for the nine months shows up this
way:—
1909-10. 1910-11.
Revenue .. £3,530,217 £3,866,839
Expenditure .. 3,168,773 3,275.453
Loans .. .. 1,140,712 1,455,219
The bricks heaved at N. S. Wales for its borrowing
habits can be taken as picked up again, and heaved
some more at Queensland. Westralia has had a
revenue of £2,808,901, and an expenditure of
£2,626,839; so that nominally it has a surplus of
£182,062. But when a State charges up meals pto-
vided for immigrants to loan account, as Westralia
was doing lately, and is doing still for all this
paper knows, the surplus is plainly bogus.

The increase during the past few years has been very
remarkable, and proves the wonderful prosperity of
N. S. Wales. And in that connection it has to be
remembered, too, that there is another vigorous
Savings Bank in existence. The immigration agent
couldn’t be provided with a stronger magnet than
these very extraordinary figures. Still, the very
rapid growth of deposits may have been partly due,
curiously enough, to the increased facilities offered
for the withdrawal of money. The old objection
was that, if a small saver wanted a small amount
quickly, and especially if he was away from home,
he couldn’t get it; and in the larger centres money-
lending middlemen made a fine thing out of giving
the would-be withdrawer ready cash. Nowadays,
however, the _ depositor can not only withdraw on
demand at his own branch any amount up to his
total credit, but he may on satisfactory identifica-
tion, withdraw £2 in any one day at any other
branch or post-office agency in the State. Moreover,
ls now an arrangement for reciprocity between
the Government Savings Banks of all the States. A
system of transfer has also been established between
this bank and the United Kingdom. All these things
have no doubt added greatly and deservedly to the
popularity of the bank.
The bank has no capital in the ordinary way apart
from the £93,834 of reserves; but it has the entire
resources of the State behind it. It is, therefore,
absolutely the strongest institution in Austral-
asia. Of the deposits and other available moneys,
£10,961,739 has been lent to the State of N.S.W.
on the security of funded stock and Treasury bills,
and another £1,441,707 is on call at the Treasury.
Four-fifths of the funds being in these gilt-edged
Government securities, the earnings are naturally
comparatively small. On the mean funds —which, of
course, include till money—they averaged £3 9s.
p.c.; interest to depositors absorbed a shade over
£2 15s. 3d. and expenses a shade over 9s. sid.,
leaving 4s. 3d. as profit, to provide for contingen-
cies. The unsatisfactory feature is the very small
amount of the savings which is being used to finance
other strugglers—-or perhaps the same strugglers.
There certainly is an Advances Department, a crea-
tion of the past two or three years, but only
£798,050 of the Savings Bank money is being em-
ployed in that business. Probably, especially in the
earlier days of the Advances Department, there was
a good deal of red-tape about the administration,
and men who might have been customers of the State
bank had the money they were in need of pushed
into their hands by private banks. This paper isn’t
going to heave even a clod at the private banks of
Australia, which are, on the whole, institutions that
the country can be proud of; but, at the same time,
their object in life is to make dividends for their
shareholders. This State Bank has no shareholders
to make dividends for ; and the one object of the Ad-
vances Department is to forward the interests of
the borrowers, while, of course, safeguarding the prin-
-01 jf. a cus t° m er has borrowed for 30 years
and has undertaken to pay in instalments spread over
that period, and if he then has the luck to strike a
good season or two, the bank will allow him to re-
duce the debt straight away—which is more than the
private mortgagee will do if the security is good and
improving. He wants the debt reduced when the
borrower looks shakier ; when the latter is firmer on
his feet the mortgage is all the better property, and
therefore, to be hung on to. And in other respects
the Advances Department shows that its job in life
is to fatten the borrower and not the lender.
The Advances Department was started on the debris
of the business of the old Advances to Settlers’ Board,
which wasn’t run on banking lines, and was looked
on as a good deal of a charity. (It operated mostly
in the days of drought, distress, and seed wheat
‘ advances,” and its clients were those who weren’t
in a position to borrow money from anybody else.)
Nominally, the old Advances to Settlers’ Board had
made profits; but these and much more have been
absorbed by bad debts. This shows how the whole
business has fared:—

During the past year a further £634 was written
off on account of losses made on the old Settlers’
Board advances; on the other hand, and by way of
a pleasant change, £1292 was recovered on account
of old advances written off. When the bank took
over the Settlers’ Board business the advances
totalled £401,741; the total has been reduced to
£135,317; and the amount of interest and instal-
ments in arrear on December 31 was only £2276.
The present bank is, therefpre, winding up the old
business with infinitely more success than at one
time seemed at all probable!. And at the same time
it is building up, though slowly, a new business on
a much improved basis.

People are beginning to find out that Australia can
do a thing or two besides grow wheat and watch
sheep grow wool. The importer had it all his own
way in Sydney for very many years; but he will get
it less and less his way the more the manufacturing
interests grow. This co. is among those that will
profit. At one time it had to be content with odd
jobs, mostly of cleaning and scraping, done for the
cargo-carriers; now it begins to do much more im-
portant engineering jobs, and the outlook is vastly
improved. No doubt it is on the latter account
that, lately, pref. shareholders have been asking to
have their shares converted into ordinaries. They
evidently reckon that the prospects are good enough
to make the preference unnecessary; and they want
to join in any larger dividend that may be going.
(They at present stop at 6 p.c.) Pref. shares will,
therefore, presently disappear, and all will rank
alike. The management writes off something against
depreciation, but the amount isn’t mentioned. Be-
sides its share capital it has £148,300 of debenture
money—and that, of course, means a first bite out
of revenue whether things are good or bad. Very
much depends upon the amount of revenue written
off against depreciation. The principal balance-
sheet items have changed in 10 years as follows:
1900. 1910.
Property, plant and stocks.. ..£327,758 £373,653
Cash and other assets .. .. 85,823 55,478
Total assets £413,581 £429,131
Less liabilities 175,660 169,012
Net assets £237,921 £260,119
Nominally, therefore, £22,198 has been added to
the assets in 10 years, so that the surplus over the
dividends has averaged £2219 a year, which is
nothing at all tremendous for a co. with a capital
of £200,000 and £170,000 of other people’s money
to safeguard. But, as remarked before, it may be
that the management has been paying for a good
many things out of revenue, and writing the cost
off against depreciation; though, on the other hand,,
it may not have been writing off enough. It is a
case of trusting the management entirely.

In addition to the usual dividend credited to share-
holders, a bonus of 2s. 6d. per share is this year
declared payable on the maturity of the shares. As
usual in such cases, the shares are £5O when they
reach maturity; and then, as usual, the capital is
withdrawable. For 3s. lOd. paid per month for 15
years (=:£34 10s.) a subscriber gets £5O; or, for
£l7 18s. lid. paid now, £5O is forthcoming in 21
years. This is guaranteed. Any surplus after pay-
ing interest to depositors and other creditors, paying
Working expenses, and providing for bad and doubt-
ful debts, goes to the credit of Profit and Loss ; and
when the surplus is regarded as more than sufficient
to guarantee the fixed interest, a bonus is allotted,
as has been done for the past year. The bonus on
this occasion amounts to £432. There is no capital
to guarantee the promised interest; the only guar-
antee fund is provided by the reserves. Hence the
wisdom of keeping them large. Moreover, they have
to do other work. The total capital (all withdraw-
able by degrees) was £47,377 on December 31. The
deposits totalled £62,645. These deposits are in-
vested in the business—that is to say, in shrinkable
securities; they are practically all advances on
building-society terms. Whether they shrink or not
the society has to pay the depositors 20s. in the £,
and the reserves have to do most of the guaranteeing
of that also. However, the risks are not large. Pro-
perty in and about Launceston is not subject to
violent fluctuations; and a moderate fluctuation
shouldn’t do much damage to a building society
which gets safer and safer with every fortnightly or
monthly payment made by a borrower. The greatest
danger is when there is a sudden boom demand for a
large sum ; if a slump happens then, the society is
liable to be left with a large block of depreciated
assets. The Equitable isn’t troubled with these
sudden demands. Things, on the contrary, move in
a very leisurely way:—

Expenses of management last year were £1293, or
about £1 2s. 6d. p.c. of advances. It isn’t much
use trying to compare this with other figures, be-
cause different societies charge different items to
management; some, for instance, have large repairs
to pay for, and some deduct rates, etc., from income,
while others show their income gross, and add taxes
to expenses of management. The figure in this case
appears to be exceedingly moderate, and the manage-
rnent generally prudent; while, if no big return is
offered, a shade over 5 p.c. is available with very
little risk indeed.

Out of the half-year’s profit £750 is put to a re-
serve for retort renewals, etc. No doubt this will
disappear next half-year, when it will be shown as
written off. An unknown amount is charged to Profit
and Loss, and written off, to cover general depre-
ciation ; the item is lumped with manufacture. This
money is no doubt spent in renewals and possibly in
extensions. A certain amount of profit can legiti-
mately be spent in this way in extensions; it is
really a set-off against the depreciated value of the
rest of the undertaking. Great progress has been
made in the last seven years. Some figures;—
1903. 1910.
Liabilities.. .. £17,546 £17,053
Liquid assets .. 3,859 13,412
Deficiency .. £13,687 £3,641
Meantime, £13,525 has been added to the book
value of the plant—-and probably a great deal more
than that has been spent. Further, the gas sales
and other revenue have scurried along from £7438
to £12,570. The figures are all remarkably good.
The liabilities consist chiefly of 4 p.c. debentures
payable in 1915; and, though it is very cheap
money, the directors are evidently saving up to get
out of pawn.

Profits are shown after “providing for wear and tear
and depreciation” ; but the amount of the provision
is unspecified. “Mining property, including mineral
lands, buildings, railway, rolling-stock, pits, tun-
nels, etc.,” stood on June 30 at £100,642. The
corresponding item on December 31 was £97,986.
That looks as though £ 2656 has been written off
out of profits. But it may have been either more or
less. It may have been more because some addi-
tional plant may have been bought during the half-
year ; and it may have been less, because some may
have been sold. The former is much the more pro-
bable. A comparison of the principal figures now
and eight years ago shows up as follows: —
1902. 1910.
Liabilities £1,473 £13,810
Mining and fixed property 83,901 97,986
Liquid assets .. . 91,567 52,047
From that it would look as though the co. hadn’t
got any forrarder in the eight years, inasmuch as
liquid assets have decreased while liabilities have
increased. Blit there is no telling how much has
been put into fixed assets. The liquid assets —prac-
tically all cash and book debts (£21,419) —are
still very substantial, and reach almost to the total
of the capital (£100,000). Apart from these few
things, nothing of any consequence is to be got out
of the published accounts. More is to be got out
of a survey of the past. For very many years the
dividends have swung between 35 and 10 p.c.,
and for the past 10 years have averaged about 17
p.c. The co. is not in the coal vend, though it is
certain that the threatened bursting of the vend
would provoke a bitter competition, which wouldn’t
do this co. any good. Besides its mine, it owns
very extensive surface properties and a tramway,
and it enjoys a large revenue from both of these
sources.

In the previous six months £5OOO or thereabouts
dropped into the accounts without saying where they
came from; evidently the directors had a reserve
of some kind up their sleeve, and shook it down.
There has not, therefore, been any real slump in
profits. The co., moreover, writes off something un-
specified for depreciation of plant and mine. This
shows the change in the cash position in the last
five years:—
Dec., 1905. Dec., 1910.
Liquid assets .. £14,701 £22,024
Liabilities .. 2,061 939
Surplus .. £12,640 £21,085
Thus the div. has been paid, and all extensions of
plant, etc., provided for, and £8445 of solid money
put in the stocking. (The liquid assets include
£19,564 on deposit.) It wasn’t always so; the
change came when the competitive system, whose
virtues we hear so much about, was given a spell, and
the Lithgow Coal Association was formed to put
an end to the throat-cutting. Everything, or almost
everything, depends on the maintenance of that com-
bination.

The original goodwill was £57,500; the total capi-
tal was £60,000. The co. thus started 22 years ago
with £57,500 of paper and £2500 of substantial
assets. As shown above, it has now £33,147 of sub-
stantial assets and £26,853 of paper. Moreover, no
less than £15,136, or almost one-half of the sub-
stantial assets (chiefly deposits), has been added in
the past five years. The great activity in the city
and suburban property market has, of course, helped
the co. enormously; but even apart from that, the
larger the snowball of substantial assets grows, the
faster it grows. The interest on the present accumu-
lation means about £1250 a year; and, even if no
other additions were made to reserves out of profits,
that sum put by yearly, and invested with interest
accretions at 34 p.e., would prodi co the required
£26,000 odd in 15 years. When that happens,
the co. will, of course, have 20s. in the £ of cash or
its equivalent, as well as the business.

The few remarks at the top of the table sufficiently
explain the history and occupation of the eo. The
Freehold Investment and Banking Co. had a short
life and a wild one. It was born in the debauch of
1892, and soon accumulated liabilities of about '
£1,300,000. When the smash came an arrangement
had to be made with the creditors, who were just
about as much to blame as the shareholders, and
new deposit receipts were issued. These were the
“A” series, A “B” series followed, representing
unpaid interest. After the mess had been* cleaned
up to some extent, it was decided to finish the job
on a sudden and wholesale scale. The old share-
holders were dropped out of the calculation, for the
remaining assets were only equal (according to the
valuation) to the paying of 7s. 7d. in the £ of the
remaining liabilities. Still, even that was better
than had' sometimes been expected, seeing that some
creditors had sold their deposit receipts to the under-
taker for as little as ss. in the £. As some of the
assets were not expected to be very productive, even
on the 7s. 7d.-in-the- £ basis, and as, moreover, it
was intended to get rid of them as fast as possible,
the capital of the present co. was fixed at £74,245,
equal to 3s. in the £ ; 4s. was represented by de-
bentures, issued to the old creditors; the other 7d.
was treated as the nucleus of a reserve fund. The
co. has had a very good time, on the whole; and,
besides paying a good dividend and adding materially
to the reserve, has accumulated a contingent re-
serve of £14,355. This, branded as a realisation
suspense account, is the profit expected to be made
on transactions not yet completed. At the end of
1908 the co. had in hand properties of the book-
value of £76,438. This has, in the intervening two
years, been reduced to £66,133. The more or less
liquid assets showed up as follows at December 31,
1909 and 1910 respectively:—
Cash and loans at short call.. .. £29,328 £28,825
Debentures, bank stock and deposit
receipts 24,444 36,755
Advances (balances, etc.) .. .. 55,089 51,109
Shares in other cos 11,721 13,344
Trifles 560 118
Total .. £121,142 £130,151
The liabilities, chiefly debentures, total £83,991;
so the surplus of more or less liquid assets is
-£46,160; and, besides that, the co. has £66,133
of unsold property, mostly freehold. Whether that
will fetch 20s. in the £ this paper doesn’t know.
Evidently what has been sold so far has averaged a
good deal more than that, the balances on completed
realisations during the past three years having been:
—l9OB, £2872 ; 1909, £1512; 1910, £5963. Rents,
interests and dividends last year totalled £17,662,
which was equal to 9 p.c. gross on the average of
the assets. Out of that interest and exes, have to
be paid, and amortisation provided to extinguish the
leasehold asset; but that the whole assets bring in 9
p.c. suggests that there certainly isn’t much over-
valuation. On the contrary, it looks as though some
at least of the property is worth more than the books
say it is. If so, it will mean more surpluses later
on.

A stone quarry is a wasting asset; but in this case
the waste is so small that it is said to be almost
imperceptible. Moreover, what there is of it is un-
derstood to be allowed for apart from the sums writ-
ten off for depreciation and shown above. In other
words —or so it was officially stated some time ago
—'wear and tear at the rate of 2d. per ton is in-
cluded in the cost of quarrying. Altogether, then,
it may be taken for granted that the profit shown,
after deducting the sums Written off, is true profit
—which it isn’t in the case of 99 mines out of a
hundred. The Co. has had a very good time these
last few years, mainly, no doubt, because of the
general prosperity, the rapid growth of Sydney arid
suburbs, the extension of roads, the increase of rateS
and the consequent patching of old roads, etc. In
the dull times some years ago things were very
sick with the Co., aiid £6BOO was written off capi-
tal as lost Or hot represented by assets. Recently,
as the table shows, this amourit was restored, and
about the same time another £6BOO was called.
The capital is now £40,800. In the past five
years this change has occurred with regard to more
or less liquid assets: —
1905. 1910.
Assets other than quarries and
fixed plant .. .. .. £3817 £8409
Liabilities.. 7814 464
Deficiency ' £3997 Surplus £7945
The position has thus been improved to the extent
of £ 11,942 in five years; but of that amount,
£6BOO is represented by new capital called up. The
business itself has paid the dividends, bought a new
property at Guildford ( £1441, book value), added
considerably to plant and machinery, increased the
quarry land and equipment at Prospect (over £4OOO
has been spent here), and put £5142 into the co.’s
stocking, or cigar-box, or whatever it keeps its loose
change in. The record is extremely satisfactory;
but this paper doesn’t know how long it will con-
tinue. The goods the co supplies can’t be regarded
as necessaries, like bread or beer; and in poor times
building almost ceases, and we put up with almost
any old thing in the form of a. road.

“0.K.”: One of the commercial sins of the Mel-
bourne City Council is the Corporation Baths —a
business which represents an annual loss to the rate-
payers of £2OOO to £3OOO. The loss is not directly
shown in the council’s accounts, wherein the baths
are tangled up with the markets and other matters;
but the deficiency is an annual event, nevertheless.
Under certain circumstances, the fact that the city
was losing money on the business of washing its
citizens, wouldn’t be very terrible; there are some
necessary municipal jobs—road-making and smell-
chasing, for instance—which one doesn’t expect to
be directly payable. But in the case of the baths,
the loss is wholly, or almost wholly, caused by some
side-shows that are not wanted at all. Also, the
big monopolised building includes a Turkish bath,
heated by a wrong system of steam-pipes, and patro-
nised mainly by parties of stout Hebrew ladies, who
are attracted by the bargain sale system of manage-
ment. In Melbourne there are but two Turkish baths
nowadays; and tpe city bath, which was opened
whilst the larger establishment was being rebuilt,
has reduced its rate to six tickets for 10s. This re-
duction doesn’t benefit the citizens as a whole; it
benefits merely a few stout parties, who, in 99 cases
out of 100 (or in 999 cases out of 1000), are well
able to afford the old rate. Really the ratepayers
are paying for some of the Turkish baths which the
Rachels and other fat citizens and citizenesses take;
and, incidentally, they are no doubt making it very
uncomfortable for the principal Turkish bath boss,
who hasn’t got any ratepayers to subsidise him.

changing over to the Metals Separation process, and
when that has been installed lower-grade stuff will
be handled. Still it is an amazing performance, see-
ing that it is all done on material which up to a
very few years ago was reckoned waste. And even
after the Zinc Corporation had started, success
seemed so uncertain only about three years ago that
a 20 p.c. preference had to be offered for the last lot
of money raised on shares.

tinues to drive its levels to the north, but prospects

The plot thickens at Bullfinch. When
Lionel Robinson’s best man, Frank Powell, wanted
to have a look at the big mine the other day, he was
told that it couldn’t be done; and now a report is
to hand that Fred Morgan’s objection to working the
property to suit the Board in London has reached
breaking strain. Just what the trouble is between
Morgan and the bosses, or why it was considered
advisable not to let Powell go below, no one seems
to know; but the market, which is generally a
pretty good guide as to how things are looking
underground, has lately been booted, from piUar to
post, and more kicks are said to* be in store.*
Dvason, Bonwick and Greenway, whom
the Westralian police couldn’t get within a mile oi
convicting of conspiracy over the Chaffinch business,
have each put in a claim for £lOOO as compensation.
* * *
Kalgurli (W.A.) lias decided to take a
null The strain of working the mine honestly and
finding ore of sufficient value to maintain present re-
turns, has begun to tell, and in order to avoid a
serious breakdown the grade is to be brought down
and the output reduced. In making this recom-
mendation to the London directors, the extra-careiul
manager, Black, says: “It is difficult to make any
definite forecast of probable returns, but the next
few months’ operations should indicate the working
grade of ore from the stopes and the fresh bodies of
ore opening up.” Beading between the lines, this
seems to indicate that values in the present working
levels are unreliable, and that the bottom of the
mine looks sick. #
At the Oroya Exploration meeting in
London lately, held with the object of inducing
shareholders to put up £lOO,OOO more cash to de-
velop five mines, because the market was not favor-
able for floating them at once, chairman H. C.
Hoover was in great form. The Youanme mine in
W.A. covered 4000 ft. along the proved ore-body. At
the 80ft. level (down to which a wild cat might fall
from the windlass without hurting its spine), the
reef was 1156 ft. long, sft. 6in. wide, and worth 50s.
a ton. This body for evfery 100 ft. in depth would
yield a profit of £60,000. At the 170 ft. level, the
shoot was 480 ft. long and worth 505., showing a
profit of £40,000. They wanted to open out at
300 ft., and if the ore body did not lose its character
(sounds like the lapse of a servant girl) the mine
was worth over £300,000! (Prolonged applause.)
The Meekatharra was another phenomenal property.
Above the 160 ft. level (the wild cat might crack his
spine or break his legs falling this far) there were
47,000 tons of ore, which would give a profit of
£42,000; and every 100 ft. of extension in depth
would mean another £30,000. If the 250 ft. level
were as good as the 160 ft., the profit above that
depth would be £72,000! (Applause.) Hoover
then transported his shareholders to the Babilonia
and Los Angeles mines in Mexico, where the revolu-
tion is coming from. The Babilonia was worth
£45,000, and the Los Angeles £20,000 per 100 ft.
of depth. Another wave of the hand, and the Oroya
illusionist took his spellbound hearers to the Maikop
oil-field in Russia, where — But, anyhow, the total
profit was £252,000 (on paper), and with an ex-
penditure of £25,000 another £120,000 could
easily be earned, or £372,000 in all. After all
this there was only one dissentient, a deaf man, and
the shareholders uproariously agreed to subscribe for
200,000 new shares at 10s., making the capital of
the Oroya Exploration Co. £250,000. Nobody
thought of asking what the directors meant to do
with the balance of ,1:75,000 of new capital. Pos-
sibly it will be deposited with the Birkbeck Bank.

News has just come from the West that
the Oroya Exploration has secured another batch of
options at Meekatharra, including one on a half-
interest in the Ingliston Consols for £52,000.
A hullabaloo was caused in Adelaide and
Perth last week by the publication of a Southern
Cross (W.A.) wire, to the effect that the Young
Bullfinch, Birthday Gift and Rowan’s Find had shut
down for want of funds. Several infuriated sup-
porters of these extremely doubtful properties in-
vaded the paper offices and cursed the sender of the
telegram for wiring such a cock-and-bull yarn about
concerns that had plenty of cash, and were still
spending it. Judging by the way developments are
shaping in the three properties, and the expenditure
that is being, incurred in their upkeep, it won’t be
long before the state of affairs reported by the of-
fending correspondent will come to pass. Already
several Bullfinch concerns have given up hope, and
are looking for other shows on which to Spend the
remnants of their capital.
R. B. Pettigrew has had his say with re-
gard to the row which the Westralian shareholders
have been making over the way in which the affairs
of the Pine Hill are being conducted. Pettigrew
swears that, if his advice had been followed by the
Board, everything would have been all right. He
also mentions the fact that the co. has still a bit of
cash in the bank, and that the trouble most to be
feared is want of water for crushing purposes. On
the other hand, there are some Job’s comforters,, who
say that the shoot has snuffed out, and that the
directors haven’t mustered up enough courage to
break the sad news to shareholders.
“McG.” : That doleful tale of the chairman
at Gwalia Consolidated (W.A.) meeting but bears out
writer’s remarks in The Bulletin in January or
February, 1908, regarding this Wiluna show’s re-
quirements. Any practical miner could thus early
—aye, two years before—-foresee the ultimate end
of the shortsighted policy of chopping out and
treating the shallow, though somewhat lengthy and
patchy, body of oxidised ore. Often enough at that
period monthly returns left profits; yet no attempt
was made to grapple with the antimonial sulphide
problem. To-day, minus cash or credit, and with
the curses of scrip-holders as an accompaniment,
they’re going to experiment and explore—or, per-
haps, they are just starting to think of doing so.
It’s part of the old, old tale in mining. Local
management may have desired correct working, but
a hungry London directorate desired a show of pro-
fits, and hang the future. And the future —together
with the chances of what looks like a legitimate
mining proposition—appears to be hanged fairly
well.

Mt. Morgan is gradually improving its
smelting practice. Last month’s output was worth
£76,004, which makes the total for three months
£230,762. The feature of the return for March is
the larger quantity (6699 tons) of basic ore used
from Many Peaks. This increased proportion of
basic ore, containing only a few grains of gold per
ton, naturally reduces the average extraction; at
present it is 2.99 p.c. copper and 6.76dwt. gold.
As time goes on the average will fall still a little
further; but there should be a set-off in the shape
of much reduced costs. Meantime a few shares are
still dropped' on to the market, particularly in
London, “at best,” which seems to suggest that
there are a few bears about.

After three months’ hard trying, Gt. Fitz-
roy (Q.) has put through 3679 tons of crude ore by
the flotation process, for a yield of 531 tons concen-
trates, containing 77 tons copper and 170 oz. gold.
Taking copper at £5O per ton and gold at £4 per
oz., the metals recovered are worth between 245.
and 255. per ton of crude ore; but even this low
value is subject to slight furnace losses. It is fairly
clear that 8., M. and Co.’s troubles are not over yet.
The flotation process is getting out less than 80 p.c.
of the copper and only 52 p.c. of the gold ; and the
stuff is only worth 2| p.c. copper in the first place.
Last month the whole output was valued at £11,464,
while the working expenses ran to £14,874.

Corbould, of Mount Elliott, has gone
south. He has done some great hustling since he
was put in charge of Elliott. “Reminds me,” said
a miner, talking of him lately, “of one night I was
going home, and there was an old fellow with a dog
just ahead of me. The old chap was blithered, and
the dog was frisking around at a great rate. Coming
across an old bag, the dog tore round and round
with it. The inebriated one gazed at him in disgust.
Then he went up to him. ‘Paddy,’ he said, ‘you’re
too energetic for North Queensland. You’d suit
Corbould.’ ” # #
Corries, of Brisbane, have put up a for-
feitable £lOOO to pay for an option over the Blair
Athol coal property. The price is £165,000, of
which £65,000 is to be in cash; and the option-
holders must speak on or before June 30.

South Glanmire and Monklaad. Gympie,
crushed 560 tons for 2170 z.—a poor return that is
excused by the mullocky nature of some of the
stopes and the poverty of the Inglewood formation.
Prospecting continu. ■< for the Power reef, which re-
cently helped No. 2 S. Great Eastern to clean up
850 tons of loz. stone. S. Glanmire would feel
quite happy again if it could get that; but the best
things at Gympie generally live near a slide or cross-
course, and do not extend far.

East Mexican, Charters Towers, crushed
367 tons for £2173, an average of £5 18s. sd.
The last previous lot of 240 tons averaged £8 38. bd.
per ton; but variable results are to be expected
from a shew like the Mexican, with its erratic ore
shoots. . .
The Tasmania gold mine has got fS’fpO
from 4963 tons ore and large quantities of by-
products. At some mines this would be good ; but
the Tasmania is one of the few that treat both by
cyaniding and chlorination; and this elaborate
method helps to account for high costs. The deepest
levels show a considerable improvement, particularly
the crosscut at the 1250 ft. level, which, after pene-
trating 43ft., has exposed a lode 4ft. wide, worth
over loz. The 1370 ft. level has been driven 338 ft.,
with Oft. of stone assaying 17dwt. at the end. the
last 40ft. has shown consistently good prospects. A
rise from the deepest level (1370 ft.) is up 88ft., the
face showing 6ft. of stone, averaging 16dwt. If the
crushings can only be made to average 15dwt., or
70s. per ton on 4000 tons a month, there will be a
substantial profit.

A Maoriland correspondent writes that “the
Christchurch syndicate which hopes to do some-
thing with iron is interested, not in the iaranaki
iron sand (B. 16/3/’ll), but in the Parapara ore.
The Parapara is situated on the Colingwood 1 enin-
sula, Nelson. The confusion has arisen, no doubt,
from the fact that the late E. M. Smith held an
option over both properties.”

THE AUSTRALASIAN WIRELESS CO., LIMITED.
The persistent, though somewhat monotonous,
regularity with which Australasian Wireless, Ltd.,
has secured the Commonwealth and M.L Govern-
ment business and shipping cos’, ship stations in
the face of the keenest interested opposition, nas
culminated in the Wireless float—the Australasian
Wireless Co., Ltd., £65,000. In other words, the
little preliminary co., after a short, but highly suc-
cessful career, blossoms into a bigger co. to carry
out the contracts secured, and conduct and develop
the message-traffic business arranged.
The £65,000 capital is divided into 50,000 £1
ordinaries and 15,000 6 p.c. cumulative prefs., ear-
marked towards purchase of patent rights. Of the
50,000 the public is offered 30,000 at os. on appli-
cation, and ss. on allotment, and ss. monthly, if
required. The remainder—2o,ooo ordinary shares
.—are allowed the vendor co. (the little Australasian
Wireless, Ltd.) as purchase consideration for con-
tracts secured, agreements entered into, and plant,
machinery and stock at factory in Underwood-street,
Sydney.
In a concern such as this, management is every-
thing ; so the Board is the old Board strengthened.
Old Board members, Hugh R. Denison (director
Australasian Tobacco Co., Ltd. the tobacco com-
pany that runs the allied tobacco companies in-
terests) and William Macleod and Walthcr Staerker.
To these are added E. Owen Cox (Birt and Co.,
Ltd.), and Sam Hordern (Anthony Hordern and
Sons). The whole of the working capital has been
underwritten. The share list opens on April 12,
closes on Thursday, April 20, but list will be closed
as soon as the full number of shares are applied for.
Applications may be sent through any broker, or to
the Secretary, J. H. Forrest, 129 Pitt-street, Sydney.
Where does the co. come in as to profits? It has
been pretty decidedly laid down by Commonwealth
and M.L. Parliaments that wireless is a postal mono-
poly—-excepting as to some small advisory business
on the naval side of the Defence Department. This
monopoly is a cast-iron one as regards . shore
stations; but as both Fisher and Ward promise an
Act making it compulsory for steamers to be fitted
by wireless, it widens the field of ship-station work-
ing. In short, the business is cut up between the
Government that runs the shore stations and the com-
pany that runs the installations on the ships. In
other words, the revenue from a message costing 55.,
either to or from a ship, will go 2s. 6d. into the
postal revenue and 2s. 6d. to the credit of the
ship’s wireless station, which explains the notifica-
tion in prospectus that arrangements have been made
for the installation and equipment of steamers
belonging to Union S.S. Co., A.U.S.N. Co., Hud-
dart Parker and Co., and Howard Smith’s. Natur-
ally these shipping companies come in on the
adoption of the company’s system by the Common-
wealth and Maoriland Governments. Then there are
the profits on Government installations, of which the
company already has on hand £35,000 worth.,
This, of course, is only a beginning.
The Company’s system deserves a word. It is
the Telefunken quenched singing spark. It has
been adopted officially by the Governments of Russia,
Austria, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Holland, Bel-
gium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Mexico, Brazil,
Argentine, Chili, Peru, Uruguay, and China, and
used almost exclusively by the Navies of these
Powers. The British and Indian Governments have
ordered Telefunken Field Wireless Outfits for Army
purposes, and the United States have recently in-
stalled with this system 20 of its long-distance
Naval Stations, and all of its new warships. This
system speaks in all languages and all codes, just
like the telegraph.
The “Patent Rights” bogey seems to have
been successfully laid, as the Telefunken patent
rights have never been successfully assailed, although
working alongside every system, in all countries, and
in all 'waters! Even the little 300-mile station on
the top of the Hotel Australia has sung nightly
unmolested, to such purpose that the Wellington
Postal authorities heard it talking from a little
tov station in the Wellington Post Office, whereupon
Ward took the system for Maoriland.

Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in
transmission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Roller
Bearings save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent,
of oil, so one of the first duties is naturally for
engineers to direct their special attention to these
bearings and to car boxes for trucks. Hyatts are
in continuous use in Cement Works, Ore Dressing
Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bushings of
flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or
truck wheels, etc. Should engineers require further
details, they can apply to the Australian Agents,

house and Co., of Wellington, the agents in New
Zealand.*

The most modern, simple and effective Vacuum
Slimes Table is the “Wilfley.” It is continuous, and
consists of a revolving drum which is partly submerged
in a tank of slimes or material to be Altered. The
drum is covered with a filter cloth supported on
grooves on the drum, which are connected by means
of holes to the interior to allow the liquid to be
withdrawn. Through the trunnions at the ends of
the drum the vacuum pipe passes to the interior.
This pipe connects with the interior of the drum,
through which the liquid and air are withdrawn by
means of a vacuum pump. The filtered slime is re-
moved by a Simple apparatus placed at or below the
level of the pulp in the tank. So that directly the
cake is removed, the surface of the filter cloth as it
revolves is immediately re-immersed in the pulp
ready to receive a fresh cake, thereby preventing the
sucking in of air, and consequent loss of vacuum
between the time the cake is removed and a fresh
one is forming. The residual liquid in the slime
cake is removed by distributing water over the sur-
face of the semi-dried cake. Owing to the fact that
the filter is circular in form, it will be seen that it
is continuous in operation, and has no complication
of valves to get out of order; furthermore, work is
being done continuously during the whole revolution
of the filter drum. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have the sole manu-
facturing rights of this filter.* [2

Serving tea to one’s visitors
in the evening is an idea which
is catching on all over the world.
And men seem to appreciate it
just as much as the ladies do.
The next time you have visitors,
without saying anything to them
about it, have some tea freshly
made and offer it around, and you
will be surprised to see how many
will take it in preference to
anything else you may offer
them.
Of course, to be thoroughly
appreciated, you should use the
finest tea you can lay hands on,
which is Robur “ Special ” grade.
It's dainty aroma and rich good-
ness is most pleasing, and will
make your friends think —even
if they don’t say it —“ what a
lovely cup of tea.”
Quite recently it won the Gold
Medal at the Paris Exhibition;
it must be good tea to do that,
don’t you think 1
QUALITY—BUCHANAN WHISKY
“BLACK & WHITE
A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, April 10, 1911.
My Dear Arini, —
The launch of the first Australian-con-
structed warship Warrego was connected, by
official inference, with the Last Trump. The
invitation list disclosed the names of well-
known persons who are notoriously dead.
Not content with this intrusion into the
murky waters of Charon’s Ferry service, the
deceased were labelled amongst those who
had accepted the invitation to be present.
The Society of Ghosts ought to protest
against this infringement of their copyright
in Hades.
Mr. Share revised the invitation lists at
Admiralty and Government Houses. Not
before they had become monumental effigies
of official stupidity. Captain Leslie Wilson
had a memory. Mr. Robertson Kerr-Clark
always invited the living, on behalf of Gov-
ernor Rawson. Chamberlain Richard Nevill
a Silt-bound Australian edition of
v\ ho s Who.” Captain Ralph Yerney
casts an agreeable manner over the sorry
work of rejecting the socially importunate
who are aggressively alive. The desire to be
present at Governor Chelmsford’s Easter
party is a prevailing disease in dress circles
this week.
“All Nations’ Fair” was not a Beauty
competition. Occasionally a pretty girl
sprinkled the solid worth of serious suburban
matrons. The Wretch says it was so oc-
casional that male creatures explored the
Town Hall organ pipes, the visitors’ book,
and the dolleries stall before they could find
anything good-looking enough to “keep the
change.” Nevertheless, financial success
went on its way rejoicing, and the chink of
coin falling into the treasury box echoed in
Queen Victoria Markets.
The Puritans in the doll stall were
amongst the best-groomed girls in the charity
fete. Mrs. Michaelis was one of the notably-
responsible persons present. Miss Molly
Levy, who seems to have grown up sud-
denly, was probably the youngest damsel, in
dove grey, with white muslin fixings. The
Greek stall (Mrs. Ross responsible) put its
faith into hurried cream draperies, with the
Greek key pattern in gold soutache. The
attendants wore their heads in the orthodox
gilt straps. In their coiffures they were
distinctly early-Athenians. The China
ladies (Mrs. Meacle was stroke oar) showed
a fine contempt for the head-greasing com-
petition peculiar to the Chinese belle of the
well-oiled locks. China had to bear up un-
der modern Australian coiffures. An inde-
terminate skirt, under a tunic with a mild
Pekin flavor in its upper cut, gave an eva-
sive hint that China was present.
The Northern Suburbs promptly retired to
the kitchen. Things inanimate at this
stall —pots, pans, kettles, new and strange
devices for not boiling milk over on to the
stove made a strong appeal to every woman
ot homing instincts. Mrs. Treflg—with an
accent over the final e, and a husband in
the State Ministry—is this kind of woman.
Her pound cake has a serious reputation for
solid merit. Her way with a goffering iron
and a .muslin frill is said to exterminate
competition. She might have acted as
interpreter last week. Even the Northern
Suburbs, which live in the kitchen (the do-
mestic help being almost extinct in the wilds
of North Sydney), met its Waterloo. This
was a round iron vessel, with two bodies,
and large holes in its head. Will Mrs. Treflg
please explain its secret habits?
Akenehi (Miss Conor-O’Brien), whose
brilliant pen illuminated this page for nearly
10 years, dismissed herself a few weeks ago.
Her approaching marriage this week
with Mr. William Macleod was her sole ex-
cuse. Newspaper women of every shade of
politics gave Akenehi a farewell tea and
strawberry party at the Australia last
week. A silver chain-bag was the votive
offering to the departing writer of the
graphic phrase.
Whether the Sheffield Choir will find time
to unpack its voices when it strikes this city
in June is not known to the casual be-
holder of their entertainment list. The
resourceful Southwell must dive into de-
tails of this kind. The Philharmonic So-
ciety means to arrest the Sheffield Glees on
their arrival in Sydney, and will give the
visitors the largest welcome the Town Hall
can hold. A conversazione that is already
taking steps to turn itself into a ball is
ear-marked for the occasion.
Montreal is the possessor of a hall that'
can squeeze 17,000 people into two per-
formances. It cheerfully accomplished this
herring-barrel feat as a mark of its appre-
ciation of the Sheffield Choir combine of
Earls and girls.
Melbourne, with its Exhibition Building,
and Ballarat with its Coliseum, reach con-
cert pitch in the housing of Australians who
are determined to go to musical events
Sydney’s Town Hall, with 4000 people, or
thereabouts, jambed up together in agitated
tempers, with other persons’ boots scraping
their chair rails, is too small for special at-
tractions.
Sydney ’Varsity has evolved a woman
student who threatens to be an authority on
Australian mineralogy. Blessed be the
name of Smith! This bright and shining
light has found favor in the learned eyes of
the Senate. To Catherine Smith is award-
ed, therefore, the John Coutts and Deas-
Thomson scholarships. Post-graduate re-
search is her chief offence.. Miss Smith, in
consequence of scholarship trimmings, will
continue _to soak her grey matter in un-
tamed minerals. She takes a cheerful view
of their “optical properties.”
The man who prospects for minerals is
generally supposed to be the person who
wants optical properties. Perhaps Cather-
ine Scholarship Smith will invent some new
and reliable method of growing gold mines
in the back yards of the deserving poor.
This is her only hope of convincing male
cynics that a woman knows the technical
difference between a brass poker and a gold
muff-chain.
Australian manufacturers’ week has in-
cited a Sydney girl to deal severely with the
blouse. Most women need no introduction
to the vicious conduct of a blouse that bucks
at the belt. They lie in wait and stab it
ivith a safety pin. They claw it with a
sharp-tongued buckle. Every resource
known to the ingenuity of woman has at-
tacked the blouse in its weakest moments.
Miss Jeanne Roth, has, continuing the fight,
invented a new blouse-grip. Its prowess will
be displayed in shop windows next week.
Jeanne is the daughter of a Swiss father
(Mr. J. J. Roth) and a French mother.
Australian-born', she has the mixed nation-
ality useful to any girl who tackles the
old-time “rising-up” nuisance. I have tried
this invention on a young and innocent
blouse. It is still struggling to find out
what hits it in the (back when it tries to
rise out of its belt limit.
Miss Connie Simpson, who has taken her
Greek cameo profile to London music-halls,
writes to deny that she is still “Corona.”
Connie has knocked “Corona” into a departed
stage memory. As Constance Craven she
was playing and singing under Alfred Butt’s
management, at the Palace, when she sent
this inky item to meet your eye. Craven
is said, by Fog-bound managers, to adjust
itself better than Corona to the thick-headed
British suspicion of foreign sounds.
Constance Craven records meeting Maie
Sydney Reynolds in Piccadillly, “looking
very sweet and dainty.” She was then just
off to India. Constance also digresses into
harem skirts, and asserts that London (Feb.
28) was mad on two subjects—“ The Choco-
late _ Soldier,” and a new dancer, Sahary
Dzeli. This Oriental enchantress gives the
well-worn Salome dance one or two fresh
features. She substitutes a stained knife
for the gruesome head of Maud Allan’s first
frenzied leap into London Society.
Mrs. Nigel Gresley died recently in Lon-
don, at the age of 83. In the ’7o’s she was
known as one of Tasmania’s “leading host-
esses.” A brilliant musician in her youth,
Mrs. Gresley kept her musical faculties al-
most to the last. This is in sharp contrast
to the average modern matron. Her atti-
tude towards the family piano is to assault it
with a feather duster in the morning, and
hire it to a professional pianist in the after-
noon. Payment in kind —fruit salad and
weak tea —is going out of fashion.
Miss Christine Kong Sing will presently
add her artistic pin-feathers to the great
flight to London. She leaves Sydney
early in May. Miss Bess Norris (Mrs.
Tait), a friend of Christine’s student-days
in Melbourne, has achieved the golden art
of getting good prices for her miniatures.
She will hold out the brush of welcome to
Australian-born Kong Sing. Her objective is
to snare the elusive art of miniature paint-
ing in its native haunts.
Dolores has had to delay her return to
Australia, owing to the prevalence of a
Maoriland rush for her concerts.
George Alexander, like most managers in
a big way of business, is aggressive qn the
topic of amateur theatricals. As a passport
to the golden gates of stage-land—alleged to
be inlaid with diamond tiaras —he considers
a long course of amateur theatricals fatal to
success. Ella Crone, of this State, shows
every symptom of escaping this blight. She
has come, apparently unscathed, through an
epidemic of amateur charity performances.
Her stage presence is good. Her intelli-
gence is acutely dramatic. Miss Crone will
have left Sydney by the Orvieto before this
reaches you. She intends to pursue the
mummer’s art in London stage schools.
Miss Madge Hellmrich escaped the kitchen
tea which generally inundates, with sauce-
pan lids, the bride-elect who has a large
circle of admiring girl friends. A swan-
song concert, to commemorate her marriage,
was the farewell offering of Girl-urbia.
Longstaff threatens an immediate descent
on this city, and may be here before the
ink dries on this letter.
The Frank Coffee American tour is likely
to begin when Sydney achieves its nearest
attempt at mid-winter weather. Mr. Coffee
was an American citizen, who once believed
he would rather be run over and killed by
a New York street car than live happy
ever after amongst Australian wattles. He
has changed his mind, and cut his wisdom
teeth. Years bring these treasures to the
mouth of middle age—to take liberties with
Carlyle, who forgot to add whether' they
could be left in a glass of water overnight.
The naturalised Australian, Frank Coffee, is
as patriotic as the home-grown bean. He
has developed into a good Commonwealth
citizen, and finds life at Chatswood much
more alluring than death on a New York
tram line.
Mrs. John Toohey, of Wahroonga, has en-
tered into possession of the Greenoaks Cot-
tage.
The Jim Osbornes have taken Uig
Lodge, the Beatons’ house at Point Piper.
They will abide there during the race-week
festivities, and for some time after. The
Wills-Allens have had the place for the last
couple of years, but Mr. Wills-Alien, sen.,
died in it a couple of weeks ago, and so they
are going elsewhere. Mr. Osborne, by the
way, ever in the forefront of fashion, is de-
liberately growing whiskers. The “best
people” of the male sex are taking enthusi-
astically to these adornments in London.
Mrs. Markell, one of Sydney’s most fas-
tidious frockers, is proving the charm of a
blue and emerald combine. Certain shades
of green and soft azure tints of blue were
the first choice in Nature’s original color-
box —witness the atmospheric garb of Aus-
tralia on a fine day. Seen recently in a
street costume, Mrs. Markell had laid blue
and green under tribute to her charms. Hat,
frock, parasol and jewellery were a fine
blend of the two colors, which, in partner-
ship, w r ould have sent our grandmothers into
hysterics.
The harem skirt is now officially known
as the jupe-culotte. According to the Il-
lustrated London News, it has recently
taken an airing in Regent-street. M. Poiret
is, so far, the only famous French dress-
maker who has a good word for the jupe-
culotte. He believes it will lead to an era
of ankle-bangles, handsome shoes, and high-
stepping soles. Worth has d —d it with
faint praise. He regards the “harem” as
the only logical sequence of the hobble skirt
—otherwise, as a passing folly.
The pros and cons of “dressing for the
theatre” are getting much press discussion in
London. There the snobs who sit among
the nobs in the most expensive seats have
always put on their war-paint, under the pre-
tence that it is their everyday dinner garb.
In London, the custom of “dressing the
house” is, or was, maintained by the system
of “papering” it, for the free passes to pri-
vate boxes, Stalls, or grand circle, bore the
printed order—-“ Evening dress indispensa-
ble.” In Paris and New York patrons go as
they please to theatres, and the deadheads
are not more beautifully arrayed than those
who buy their seats. Australia’s big cities
thus far have been slavishly English in their
dress-circle customs, and here, even more
than in the great British Fog, the women
have delighted to go to the play as though
they were going' to a dance—the men being
bound more or less to follow suit. Natur-
ally, the mummers plead for the continuance
of this feminine rule. It pleases their
vanity. It pleases, also, the management
that part of the “house” should provide
something of a show for the rest of the
house. Louis Nethersole, who acted as
business manager for Margaret Anglin in
Australia, rejoiced over the smart appear-
ance of a first night crowd in Melbourne or
Sydney, as compared with a fashionable
audience in America. Yet it is doubtful
whether the war-paint regulation does more
good than harm to theatrical business. The
London papers have almost decided that
many people are staying away from theatres
because of the trouble of changing their
clothes for the sole purpose of going to see
a play. In this country there is more
temptation for the women to flaunt abroad
in airy finery, but the tax upon the com-
mon-sense of the men is almost as severe as
in the Cold Country, and they are likely to
insist upon a revolt against the rule of
“Evening dress indispensable.”
“Have you forgotten, father dear, all the
wonderful stories with which you used to
enchant our long country walks, when my
tiny legs were unwilling, but when I forgot
to complain of fatigue, asking you instead :
Et alors, petit pere, what did the Princess
do?’ ” Thus “Martouche,” in the brief pre-
face to “Phrynette and London.”
The woman who can write a book without a
preface, or make a remark without a post-
script, is on the high road to fame. Marthe
Troly-Curtin, author of “Phrynette,” has not
escaped the' preface, but she is picturesque
and abbreviated. Dymock’s are responsible
for the arrival of “Phrynette” in the middle
of this letter. She is worth quoting.
“Amongst the things I jotted down in my
note-book,” says “Phyrnette” of France, “is,
that skating Englishwomen seem to have a
fondness for feathery hats and anachronistic
streamers... .My aunt is busy making hor-
rid little crochet things for a bazaar. She
asked me if I could help her. I had to con-
fess I could not. She looked surprised.
‘Why, all my er —under —clothing, I
trimmed myself with crochet as a girl.’ I had
thought as much. I could not imagine Aunt
Barbara’s lingerie of transparent batiste,
trimmed with frothy Valenciennes.”
Roycroft and other Sydney libraries are
circulating Elinor Glyn’s last book, “His
Hour.” “Women will have it, and give it
up with reluctance,” said one librarian who
is steeping his aching brow in cold tea-
leaves. He has to keep calm. “Why don’t
men go to church?” and “Why don’t you
get more copies of ‘His Hour’?” are smash-
ing up the mental outlook of every other
young and susceptible librarian. The Glyn
maelstrom of whirligig emotions ds drawing
the Young Person to worship at the shrine
of the Greek god.
Elinor Glyn found her opening situation
for “His Hour” at the feet of the Sphinx.
Tamara, the heroine, is obviously English,
in spite of her Russian name. She visited
the Sphinx—in search of a new sensation —
at 2 o’clock in the morning. Elinor Glyn
knows all the romantic ropes that tug even
a tourist resort into a daring defiance of the
narrow ethics of Mrs. Grundy. Her clever,
vulgar style is full -of sharp epigrams. Her
saving grace is an unshaken desire to hit
Mrs. Grundy in her line of least resistance.
She introduces the inevitable —a beautiful
bounder of princely rank, in this manner:
“At first I was angry,” he says, “when I saw
your camel against the sky.... I like to
have her (the Sphinx) all to myself. But
afterwards, when I watched you, I saw you
meant no harm; you aren’t a tourist, and
so you did not matter.” Tamara, though
a nicely-brought-up young woman, takes
this impertinence in good part. The Sphinx
is chaperon. Prince Milaelavski leaves the
impression, on the merely Australian reader,
that his beauty would have been spoiled in
any Commonwealth school or college by a
comprehensive thrashing at least once in
every day.
Many passages in “His Hour” make the
same appeal to the Young Person of to-day
that Ouida made to the schoolgirls of 20
years ago. Ouida was devoured in prim
boarding-schools, by the uncertain light of
secreted candle-ends. Elinor Glyn is swal-
lowed in public. Times have changed for
the better. Novels of a certain type-’ show
less improvement in their false heroics and
fancy-dress emotions.
“An Australian Night” will be given to
Madame Boult on April 21. As hon. sec.
of the Australian Dramatic Authors’ Asso-
ciation, this compliment is intended as a
strong hint that the said authors appreciate
her interest in the now going concern. St.
James’s Hall, Phillip-street, will be top-
dressed in palms for the Boult entertain-
ment.
Wandering Australians who scratch the
snow at St. Moritz for Swiss glacial-period
amusements, send me joyous, frost-bitten
post-cards. They don’t seem to remember
that we have heard of St. Moritz before to-
day. The late George Robertson, of Colac,
an Australian, really started the festive
Moritz on its prosperous career in the tobog-
ganing trade.
Carine Cadby, who shakes an informative
pen on Alpine sports, is very sound on the
reformative effect of ski-ing for “catty” wo-
men. Tobogganing is also said to be a
good nerve cure. For the neurasthenic pets of
modern society, however, ski-ing is particu-
larly commended. Husbandettes might
also try it. It gives courage. One of its
charms is that it is such a sociable sport.
The girl who sprains her ankle to enlist the
sympathy of a handsome young man needn’t
play those pranks at a ski-ing party. The
active beau is too busily enployed pulling
his broken nose out of an adjacent snow-
drift to worry about good-looking ankles
that belong to other people. The woman
tvho can’t learn to take care of her feet is
safer in a St. Moritz hotel drawing-room.
She can put them on the fender.
From “the man Outback” came a cheque
for St. Margaret’s Hospital for Women.
Matron Abbott forwards a consignment of
thanks per safe conduct of the penny post.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, April 10, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Two separate garden-parties sunned themselves
on the clipped lawns of Stonington last week. On
Monday, beneath a blue sky, the bulk of the
motoring multitude ran out and shook hands,
l’he Carmichael lady, in a petunia-colored gown,
stood under an awning for this wearisome part of
the function. Niece Ena, in a white muslin
frock, and with her hair up, helped in the polite
pump-handling, and Governor Carmichael smiled
and bowed like clockwork. Secretary Victor Hood
and Aide Vaux directed the stream of guests to the
vice-regal pressure, whence it flowed on to the ter-
races and lawns. Stonington is an ideal place for
carden parties. The house ODens its hospitable
doors to the men guests, while the women trail
round the flowers and wait for afternoon tea in
the usual marquee. This time the Pierrots had a
circus tent all to themselves on the upper terrace,
where roses nod in the wind when there happens
to be any.
The continued-in-our-next party on Tuesday
afternoon was devoted mostly to artistic people,
though the Zoological Society was also repre-
sented. The Carmichaels showed some origin-
ality in the drawing up of the two guest-lists.
No ordinary garden could possibly hold all the
people who figure on the vice-regal visitors’ list.
Former magnates got out of the difficulty by
inviting people alphabetically. The arrangement
did not bring any joy to the people who were
recorded in the M to Z ledger, because the A to L
division got first call every time. Mrs. Acid
laughed at Mrs. Muchcash, and the air of
superiority Miss Lukewarm assumed when she
met poor little Miss Zero was unbearable.
On Tuesday, Federal members had their innings
with the Art section. Prime Minister Fisher and
Mrs. Fisher drank their tea at the Governor’s
table along with the “Jack ’’ Thompsons and the
Peter Mcßrides. The Mcßrides brought with
them a 17-year-old daughter with her own curls
pinned up in the Early Victorian style, which is
just in again. The hostess wore intricate braid-
ings all over her mauve-colored gown. Mrs.
Fisher wpre a black gown low in the neck, accord-
ing to the latest fashion ukase, and a turban hat
of royal blue with a band of gold.
The .Cloyne Maddens were absent in a
bunch, the day being the anniversary of one of
their many family bereavements. The Frank
Madden two were present, however, dressed in a
droopy, l artistic way. A girl who drew the atten-
tion of all was Roma Clarke, daughter of W. J. T.
Clarke, of Mount Schanck, in South Australia,
where the Carmichaels stayed during their Mount
Gambier wanderings. She’ was quite the best-
dressed girl on the lawn, in a lovely white frock.
Artist Longstaff held a reception of his own on
the lower terrace. The Abrahams pair were also
on hand, and several studios full of V.A.S. mem r
hers wandered amiably at large. Ambrose Patter-
son had his n«Jw little wife with him, under a
granny hat. Author Paul Wentz cut his
part in the social stroll as short as pos-
sible,'and drifted away. Some artistic souls
perched the stove-pipe hat of convention on top
of their artistically tangled hair, and thereby
achieved a weird effect which almost stampeded
their friends. The University crowd was also in-
cluded in the Tuesday party. Serious professors
gave up an hour or two to butterfly fluttering,
and seemed to enjoy themselves in a placid, re-
flective way. Mrs. “Queen’s” Sugden wore a
dress all browns and autumn tones.
The music, supplied by a band and a string
orchestra, was intensely Scawtch. Also, two
kilted warriors pranced nimbly through a sword
dance.
The Arts and Crafts gathered tearfully for
their third annual meeting on Friday night.
Lady Carmichael, as president, was in the
chair for the very last time. The Governor and
Aide Vaux accompanied the capable lady and
listened attentively to the remarks she made to
the admiring band of craftswomen. She quoted
the cjmical words of some unobserver that “art
in Melbourne has been, so far, in a tub” (it
sounded like “pub”), and declared that, if that
was so, the Arts and Crafts Society was at any
rate pulling it out.
The room was cosy with hatted and furred
dames, and the function had the friendly atmo-
sphere of a come-in-and-hring-your-work after-
noon. This despite a plentiful sprinkling of men
—mostly of the decorative (or decorating) species.
Architect Walter Buller made one of the throng,
and I noticed the aesthetic furnishing Stockfeldt!
Auguste Fischer (who only sees through the glow
of stained-glass windows) and the artistic Black-
well were also about. Mrs. President, with two
big blooming cabbage roses in her black dress,
sailed confidently ahead, and fairly pelted the
house with practical suggestions. “Specialise in
the prizes,” said she. “ Last exhibition we had a
model nursery for a house. Give a prize for a
library or a dining-room ; only make the onlooker
realisetheproportions.” Thensheranon to describe
an ideal living room in the house of author George
Macdonald, and advanced the suggestion that the
society should take possession of almost-completed
houses, “such as are springing up all round,” and
design all the decorations, including the garden.
“ Commandeer one room for A. and C. exhibits,”
advised the clear-eyed enthusiast 1 , “until the
work is finished.” Another striking suggestion
was that the society should gather together a loan
collection of portraits from the people who have
good things hanging on their walls, and like them
to be admired.
The Art's and Crafts Society is branching out.
An exhibition will be held in Launceston during
the first week in May. The whole Commonwealth
is invited to send exhibits. Victorians may send
through secretary Mac George, who has her office
in the Collins-street rooms.
The Osborne-Atherton wedding was a theatri-
cally spectacular affair. The beautiful bride was
attended by a group of beautiful bridesmaids.
(Which seems to show that the bride isn’t of a
jealous disposition. It takes a lot of good-nature
and courage to invite comparison.) St. John’s
ivy-covered church in Bast St. Kilda provided the
setting. “She” wore crystal-white satin, thus
bravely pitting her brilliant complexion against
daring white, instead of softening ivory. The
dress was a long-trained affair covered with
crystal beads and fringes on Brussels net.
The veil, which was pleated round her face like a
Butch cap, was adorned with orange blossom.
Then came the phalanx of bridesmaids—Molly
arid Muriel Atherton, Gwladys Chirnside, Nan
O’Hara and Gladys Box —in pink satin. Their
frocks kept the women guests whispering for a
quarter of an hour. “Fishtail backs !” was ex-
citedly telegraphed all round the sacred edifice.
They also had the newest kimona coats of net and
lace, and their dainty bonnets of pink tulle and
silver lace glimmered in the stained-glass sunlight.
Everybody was at the wedding, or else came on
from the other orange-blossom affair a mile or two
away. Most of the motoring people “did ’’ the
two—the reception parts, at any rate. The re-
ception occurred at Illawarra, in Toorak, the
Atherton house, which had been redecorated for
the occasion. All Toorak was in attendance.
Ruby Madden-Osborne was over for the affair,
also Mr. and Mrs. Hope Osborne and the rest of
the clan. The ballroom was hung with native
clematis, and the breakfast was overhung with
pink roses. Mrs. Atherton wore a smoke-grey
dress in tulle and satin, with some red Jacqueminot
roses for color. The bride put on black velvet for
travelling, with a coat and furs of musquash that
a thoughtful bridegroom had provided. Her
granny motoring hat, which accompanied, was of
royal blue and black.
At time of writing, speculation js rife as to
whether the Buchanan-Cumming or the Brookes-
Emmerton wedding will reach the loftiest top
note. Each is to be a veritable scream. But as
the bridegroom and the best man at the former
wedding are to be dressed for the part in their
respective war paint, and as the ceremony is to be
witnessed by the G.-G., it is likely it will win by
half a tone. There seems to be no just cause or
impediment why Norman Brookes, the tennis hero,
should not also sport his insignia of Greatness; and
his best man could be beautiful in a blazer too.
The Emmerton heiress set Australia at naught as
regards her trousseau, for she and her parents
tripped off to Europe to collect it. The bridal
veil and gown are of valuable Venetian lace. A
court train of velvet will be held up by a small
Staughton girl, whose mamma had her court train
upheld on her wedding day by the Emmerton
chick. A diamond necklace, given by her parents,
will glitter upon the bride’s neck.
The future Mrs. Buchanan will not be out-
classed in the lace scheme, as her all-white will be
enriched with old Wragge lace. Not old rag,
but precious fabric which has been in the Wragge
family for years, they say. (N.B.—One of the
Gumming brothers took unto himself a very
pretty Wragge for better or worse, and ’tis she
who is responsible for the decoration above-
mentioned.) Lauehlan Mackinnon, the third, will
keep the gallant captain in countenance by
attending to the bridal train in all the bravery of
kilt and sporran.
Said that a marriage is forthcoming between a
western district girleen and the successful peti-
tioner in a famous divorce case. No sooner had
the poor man disembarrassed himself of the
respondent than Rumor found many “second
tries” for him. One effort of the old lady’s
imagination was to assign him as a candidate for the
hand from which he had got legal release. There
was nothing whatever in that yarn; but Rumor
seems to be telling the truth this last time.
The other Wednesday the City newsboys ten-
dered a goodbye concert to their President, the
Carmichael lady, at their rooms in Coromandel
place. A couple of hundred young voices which
nightly quicken the pulse of the city bv calling,
“ ’Orrible Tragedee /” cheered their kindly
patroness as she entered the hall, and later the
owners of the voices received from her hands the
picnic prizes, including suits of clothes and strong
boots. The clothes were examined and the boots
tried_ on at the back of the hall with much
rustling of brown paper. Then, in their turn,
theswarm of small hosts presented the lady with a
fountain pen. While struggling through'a pretty
speech of thanks, the recipient was encouraged to
proceed by a shout of “ That's all right, Mum ! ”
from a hoarse-voiced lad at the back. In addition
to the Pathe Freres pictures of cowboys and
things, IJnie Russel] and some other clever people
contributed a good programme of music. Among
the visitors on the platform were Vera Clarke,
the vice-president, and Colonel Reay, of the
’Erald, the evening sheet in which the boys are
at least commercially interested.
Paris Nesbit, the handsome K.C. who had a
howling match with a Port Melbourne audience
on Saturday, had just got back to Adelaide from
the remunerative boundary dispute when he was
induced to return to Melbourne by the “ Liberal ”
side to speak against the Referenda proposals.
Nesbit never uses notes. He ruminates in
some quiet spot for an hour or two, and mar-
shals whatever arguments he has. Then he rises
prepared for the fray, and, when the right
moment comes, starts the oratorical procession.
When he isn’t allowed to proceed without inter-
ruption he asks his audience if they would rather
be bigger fools than they look, or look bigger
fools than they are, and sits down angrily
on his hat. He is always liable to break out in
unexpected places. Years ago his front name used
to be spelt with two s’s; but he made up his mind
that that was wrong, and so got the S. Australian
Court to prune one of them off. He used to occa-
sionally bring out a paper to uplift Adelaide; and
once he wrote in it an article to maintain his view
that The Bulletin is one of the half-dozen most
really and truly religious papers in the English-
speaking world. In fact, I think his idea was
that there were no more than the half-dozen alto-
gether. I’m sure you’ll be sorry to hear that he
didn’t even mention the S. M. Herald.
Ye Olde Englyshe Fayre (blame the invitation
card for the spelling), in aid of the Alfred Hos-
pital, is to be officially opened on Saturday after-
noon, April 15, in the vast, barnlike Exhibition.
The Carmichaels are to do the little job in polite
burgling. Immediately afterwards, sassiety
matrons and more or less sweet girls will start to
hold up the public in the interest of Charity.
Mrs. McCubbin turned the opening of the
McCubbin-cum-Patterson picture show into an
affair of drawing-room cosiness. There was an
unusually large number of males on hand for the
opening ceremony, including several of the picture-
buying variety. Laurie Abrahams, who has lent
a lot of his McCubbin paintings to the show, was
present, of course. Hr. Myer, too, was among
the inveterate art hunters; whilst Bernard Hall
and other Feltonians prowled with interest.
Monty Brown (who shortly exhibits), Mrs. May
Vale Gilfillan, Mrs. Heardon and Dr. Wood like-
wise helped to obstruct the view. A little girl,
who ambled round the room in a fierce little toque
of bright yellow, perched on the side of
her bronze locks, was a startling sight even
for an Art show. Beatrice Day wandered
about in a simple white frock, with a bunch
of violets tucked into her waist belt. The
McCubbin hostess, in a high-waisted grey
velvet frock and a black picture hat, looked as
if she had just walked out of a frame. Young
McCubbins hovered round, handed pr ogrammes,
and generally looked after the comfort of the
drifting visitor. Sheila and Kathleen, the two
little McCubbin maids whose portraits adorn the
walls, were there in the flesh. Mrs. Abrahams
bought a picture of Lou MeCubbin’s, called “The
Stone Crusher.” The young man is an ardent
student, and those who know what is what in the
world of art are confident that he will do bie
things.
Ambrose Patterson had a corner full of his
most recent work, including some drawings and
several glimpses of Port Phillip beaches. “ Beau-
maris” is a picture looked at keenly by the
Gallery ; also a fine picture of detail called “On
Change.” Pretty Mrs. Ambrose, a young Eng-
lish girl who came out to Australia to marry her
artist just a year ago, helped in the entertaining.
Quite a party of old Paris chums gathered round
her, and talked gaily of old times.
I suppose Prime Minister Fisher, now on the
high seas, will take himself to Edinburgh
after the Coronation, if it be only to pose against
the much-photographed Wall. Fisher has been
farewelled to so many bagpipes that he owes it to
his friends to visit the place. It has become
almost a proverb that no Scotchman goes back to
his own country for good. They do revisit it,
but only to show themselves and remember how
poo-er they were before they got out. Then they
come away again.
Mrs. Secretary Sheppard, whose husband at-
tends Prime Minister Fisher, had her own batch
of good-byes, and gathered a crop of bouquets
from her window of the departing Adelaide
express. She takes away with her a trunk or so
of Australian-made frocks.
The Dudley children have been gathered
together, well wrapped up and shipped to
England. Doctor Dunhill, who did, some ’itis
chasing in the Dudley family, instead of going in
the later Morea, as he originally intended, handed
his august patients over to another medicine man,
grabbed his professional bag and a suit case, and
rushed for the liner with the olive branches. Ifi
all probability a rush made in courtesy to the
Countess, who felt qualms about entrusting her
family during a long, wobbly voyage to the care
of nurses, governesses and maids.
The manager of a tall hotel in this city said he
felt like a Salt Lake elder when the census papers
happened along. He was merely head of the
house according tp the regulations ; but flurried
guests who didn’t understand their papers marked
him down as “ Father ” and “Husband.” It took
himself and a worried collector several solid hours
to straighten,out the papers and his own repu-
tation.
Mollie Carpw has taken a 12 months’ engage-
ment from J. C. Williamson to play Nellie Wil-
son’s parts. Miss Mollie has stacks of confidence
and other valuable goods. When she interviewed
the J.C. W. management it requested her to sing,
and proposed to call in music and accompanist.
The little lady flirted her bright head and said
that neither was necessary, and forthwith sat
down and sang and played music. Then the
astounded managers engaged her on the spot.
Also her best girl pal got an engagement too, so
that the fair Mollie would not be lonely.
“Flat” life in the city affords one some queer
roof-glimpses. A Gothic thatch, festooned with
“the wash,” sets me wondering how the washer-
lady managed to negotiate the Alpine slopes
without the usual icepick and rope. Looking out of
another window at the back of a pile of buildings
which present a dignified front to a fashionable
street andareinhabited principally by medical men,
I observe the spiral fire-escape which offers the hur-
ried butcher, baker and milk-ob the only way of
getting at their high-level customers. Marianne,
spick and span in the regulation uniform, looks
from her breezy steel watch-tower at a bread-
laden knight clattering gaily up in a sort of aerial
dance. It is idyllic to see her leaning out like
the Blessed Damozel and taking the offerings
from the panting devotee.
Melbourne people are promised anew moun-
tain-air resort not too far from town. About four
miles from the Warburton railway station there
is an earth pimple which rises fully three-quarters
of a mile above the station level. A winding-road
about eight miles long would make the summit
accessible to coaches and open the route to habi-
tation, so the Public Works Department talks of
making it.
The way Australian political visitors are being
quartered on the British nobility during Corona-
tion time reminds one of the way most of the big
church conventions are run. Staunch adherents
get strange, visiting clergymen dumped upon
them ; they take whatever angel has been allotted
them, and treat him as kindly as possible. Any
private thoughts they have in the matter are
buried deep in their churchy hearts, or hissed at
intimate friends behind the Sabbath belltopper.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
There are signs that we are awakening from our
summer lethargy. Some dances threaten, and on Saiur-
dy the North Adelaide Golf Club is to smite its first ball
to an accompaniment of afternoon tea. Last Saturday
the S.A.J.C. Autumn meeting transpired at Morphett-
vil'le. Sartorially, it was an off day. Frockers hesi-
tated, for the most part, between remnants from
last winter and belated muslins. The most profit-
able happening of the day was Brownloek’s win
in the Hurdles, which gave his supporters £27 10s.
for £1. There was the usual rush and scramble at train
and tote ; if a paternal Government won’t increase our
betting facilities, it might at least protect us from
trampled toes and battered headgear on the road.
By the way, are jockeys superstitious? All the “ boys”
sported crfipe armlets for late President Baker, and it’s
not everyone who’d care to start in a hurdle scramble so
bedizened.
Secretary von Doussa looks like establishing a re-
cord for Onkaparinga. "Gates and booths have sold
for £1058—top price to date—and everything on wheels
has long since been chartered for the day. The Club has
made some necessary innovations and alterations, which
include a motor enclosure and an improved entrance.
Our Admiral Ex. doesn’t let the grass grow under his
feet. He’d no sooner returned from the South E ist (and
made nice remarks anent its need of a decent harbor)
than he set out for Moonta and Wallaroo. Wberebi’
hangs a tale. Kadina was to have been included in the
itinerary. But the City Fathers had no official knowledge
of the visit till too late —that is to say, till a local mag-
nate had commandeered vice-rovalty. The mayoral
dignity felt hurt, and said so. Telegrams flew ’twixt
Government House and an almost tearful Council. The
Upshot was that his Ex. has. been politely invited to
officially visit Kadina in October, and not before.
Patrons of “The Dandies ” lam-nt the illness of Mrs.
Claude Dampier. As Ireha de Vere the little lady has
danced and smiled her way to wide popularity. She and
her husband contribute to much of the success of the
show, and appear to enjoy it themselves as much as
anyone.
Talking of sickness, doctors and lodge-patients are at
variance, and apparently the Adelaide Hospital is em-
broiled. Anyway, Grand Mast- r Solomon, of the
A.N.A., threatens to establish a hospital of their own for
their own benefit.
The Grosser Kurfurst further depleted our population
to the tune of medico Bollen and his wife. When he’s
not ricking his neck looking at processions, the doctor
will turn his attention to the latest in x-rays and operat-
ing apparatus. There’s some talk of a big hospital near
Woodville, which is within the Bollen range of practice.
After a perfect orgy of farewells, the Mayor Cohens
make their final bow on Friday.
At present parading these streets are two individuals
with wild beards and long, lank hair stretching wpll
below their waists. They affect mustard-colored suits,
and are here as the exponents of a doctrine which
preaches, among other things, absolute immortality.
Most people would prefer a shorter life and a less extra-
ordinary appearance.
The Society of Arts’ annual show is responsible for the
exhibition of some good work. Hans Heysen deals hap.
pily with gum trees and oxen. He gets the spirit of the
bush excellently on to his canvas, and his work is suffi-
cient answer to those who blab of “monotony” and
“lack of character” in our scenery. President Gill’s
contributions include a “Portrait of a Lady,’,’ which is
worth looking at. There are, by the way, more portraits
and figure studies than usual, and if some of them deserve
more credit for technique than beauty, it’s neverthe-
less a phase of work to encourage. A head of an
old fisherman, by Rose Maepherson, calls for com-
ment, and the same lady carries all before her iii the still-
life class. The Ashtons, between them, cover a wide
range from seascape to suburbia. A couple of Victorian
scenes from Edward Davies and a head by Elsie Wells
also deserve the nod of approval.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.
The suffragette joke in Britain, which was
getting to be‘a very old and frayed joke, tooka bright
new turn on Census night. The angry women
gathered together in sundry places and spent the
night at skating rinks, etc.; so the police
“ roughly numbered them, and entered them as
‘homeless.’” '

This Woman Spent Weeks
in Agony Until She Tried
the Tonic Treatment.
• o
Many who are tortured with neuralgia will read
with interest the statement of Mrs. J. Adcock, of
Bunburv, W.A., who was cured of a very severe
case by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. Her experience
is only one of many, as these pills have cured a
host of cases, and those who have used them tor
neuralgia have gone on sound medical lines.
Neuralgia is a nervous disorder, and experience
has proved that there is no better nerve tonic than
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. Mrs. Adcock, whose
husband has a store on White’s Road, lives at the
corner of Railway Parade and Carey Road, She
“ We were living in Derby, and the| climate
there affected my nerves and brought on neuralgia.
I suffered dreadfully for weeks, and in spite of all
the remedies I tried I could not find any relief.
The pain was present all the time. I could not
sleep or eat. and fell away in looks. I would try
applications of hot salt and hot bran, and anything
that I might get a little ease from. Every nerve
of my face gave me pain. It would throb up to
my temples and affect the back of my eyes. 1
could not see to read or sew. At night I could not
sleep. 1 would rise and walk about quite frantic.
It was in cold weather, and I dreaded to go out-
side; the nagging, shooting pains always felt
worse, and I would often have to bandage my face
to avoid a chill. I don’t know how I got through
the day’s duties, but they had to be done. I tried
many remedies all in vain, then I read in a news-
paper about Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and Mr.
Adcock got them for me out of our store. I hey
gradually toned up my system, and drove the
neuralgic pains away. I am always glad to re
commend this tonic, for I have never had an
attack since, my health remaining capital, i
took three boxes altogether.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are sold by chemists
and storekeepers, or sent by mail, post paid on
receipt of price, 2s. 9d. per box, six boxes 15s. 3d
by the Dr. Williams Medicine Co., of Australasia

POLITICAL
POINTS
When Alfred Deakin spoke in Adelaide he
dwelt upon the probable awful consequences to
the railways if the people voted “Yes” with
regard to Federal Arbitration. “ Everybody,” he
said, “will ask: “ Who owns the railways?’”
And, as he asked “Who owns the railways?”
Deakin turned to his chairman. His name was
Cohen.
“Vic.”: Justice Higgins’s recent lecture
on the Growth of Constitutions throws up the
windows and invites us to look back. The first
Victorian Parliament sat in St. Patrick’s Hall,
from 1851 to 1856-. This St. Patrick’s Hall Par-
liament was very one-sided. In theory the Par-
liament was half nominee and half representa-
tives ; but the second half represented sheep and
cattle more than men. The Speaker was Dr.
James Frederick Palmer, duly qualified, but re-
duced to gingerbeer making. He was an ex-
mayor of Melbourne, and in 1856 became Presi-
dent of the Legislative Council. An invaluable
contemporary picture, by Strutt, shows the St.
Patrick’s Hall Parliament. O’Shanassy loomed
very large in it in every sense ; he followed Went-
worth’s course in turning from Radical to Tory.
On the other hand, McCulloch, afterwards the
Radical, was picked by Governor Latrobe as a
fitting Tory Nominee.
Notable how Decayed Fish and “ Liberal-
ism ” walk ever hand in hand, so to speak. The
following from the Australasian has been re-
printed in at least four English dailies in the last
two months :
Membership of Parliament (in Australia) is deemed a
reasonable and natural ambition for any person, how-
ever uncouth and uninformed. Knowledge, experience
and strength of character are, indeed, by many people
deemed disqualifications, for they unfit men to content
themselves with the ignoble role of a cog in the caucus
wheel. The position is regarded as a “ billet ” pure and
simple—a billet requiring the suppression of one’s indi-
viduality, it is true, but well paid, and still conferring
some conventional distinction.
And then the Australasian— the paper which
represents that the country it lives in is run by
uncouth people, lacking in knowledge, experience
and character—wonders why Britons are shy
about immigrating here.
APPLES OF OBLIVION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Tory lay on his last lone bed ;
The tears were wept, and the prayers were said,
And back he fell on the pillow—dead.
A floating cloud of inflated lies,
His soul soared up through the starry skies
Till it reached the Gardens of Paradise,
Where angel-guardians hailed him : “ Wait!
Here Apples hang, of the store of Fate,
Which each must taste ei i he pass the Gate :
“So swallow Oblivion’s fruit, and thus
Forget the Earth and become as Us ! ”
But the Soul outspluttered : “ Prepos-ter-ous!!
“ Shall 1, a provincial Soul, wot fights
For States, forget—in a few swift bites —
All thoughts o’ States an’ their damaged Rights?
“An’ threats that ‘the Constitootion fails’?
An’ the Sydney Morning Blowfly’s tales
Of ‘Gross Affronts’ upon Noo South Wales?
“ An’ th’ ‘ Federal Pin-pricks,’ sharp and sore ?
An’ Bruce Smith, wild with his yells of ‘ War !’?
Why, ivot on earth is a Heaven for t
“ I spurn your ‘ Bliss’! I refuse your Prize 1
I prefer my crusted Provincial lies
To all the Happles o’ Paradise ! ”
He turned, as one who had chosen well,
And toddled down to the brawls in Hell;
While out from realms where the Great Bear plods
Rang the endless mirth of the Great High Gods.
N.S.W.
AUGUSTUS BLOWFLY.
IT IS POSSIBLE TO REDUCE FLESH
WITHOUT DIETING OR EXERCISE.
It is not only possible but being done everywhere.
Exercise, unless carefully professionally superin-
tended, may easily do a deal of harm to the over-
burdened body. The stout man or woman who is
determined to get thin is only too likely to over-
strain the muscles by ill-advised exercise, and so
cause troubles that may develop into something
far worse than too much flesh. The same with
dieting. Starvation is certainly effective, but it is
sure to weaken the patient constitutionally, while
at the same time it is constant torture.
Fortunately neither dieting nor exercising is
required or desirable if one uses the right remedy
for reducing fat, and, strange to say, that remedy
is a simple, wholesome home mixture the ingre-
dients of which are obtainable at any chemist’s at
a small cost. This mixture is as follows : One half-
ounce of Marmola, one ounce of fluid extract of
Glycyrrhiza B.P., one ounce of pure Glycerine
B.P., and Peppermint Water to make six ounces ;
atid the proper amount to take is two teaspoonfuls
after meals. This mixture takes the fat off rapidly
but naturally, so that no wrinkles are formed and
no harm is done to the stomach, as is too frequently
the case with “ patent ” or "secret” remedies.
In order to meet a constantly repeated demand,
the above prescription has been condensed in the
form of a compact and perfect tablet known as
Marmola Prescription Tablets, and those readers
who prefer them to the liquid form can obtain same
of any chemist, 3s. Gd. per box, or post free from
The “Marmola Co., 7 Barrack Street, Sydney,
N.S.W.*
The tremendous indignation of Wade
(V.C.), Wood, Garland, Solemn Lee and the
Sydney daily press at the alleged “gagging” of
Holman recalls the famous scenes in the N.S.W.
House when Wood was putting the Coercion Act
through. Then the gentlemen who are now
shedding crocodile-tears over the silence of
Holman made no bones of moving the gag at
every stage of a bill which was without parallel in
N.S.W. legislation since the infamous Treason
Felony Act of the Ws. To be wept over by
Wood, Wade, Garland, and the whole crowd of
his former gaggers ought to be enough to make
Holman’s gorge rise. ,
This is how the Australian correspondent
of one Maoriland paper described lou Ward’s
dash through Sydney en route to the Big Smoke :
His visit was admirably stage-managed ; his whole
journey is admirably managed. Seemingly he will reach
London, an Ambassador of Empire, before any of the
other Prime Ministers ; and be will have the colonial
stage to himself quite long enough to be able to show
England that his is the leading role. Mr. Fisher, for Aus-
tralia, straggling in several weeks later on, will find the
limelight pre-occupied. Once more Maoriland is lead-
ing, and competition follows a long way behind. After
three days in Sydney—one for “ Veni,” one for “ Vidi ”
and one for “ Vici”—Mr. Ward is on his way to Canada,
with triumphant cable messages preceding him, and con-
gratulations bobbing in his wake.
And after a few weeks in London Joseph will be
on his way back with the shadow of the trium-
phant mortgage preceding him and the sign of
the three balls gleaming in his wake.
A PERSONAL APPEAL.
Canvasser (protesting): “But, my good sir, if you vote for the Referendum it will put
an end to the powers of the State.”
Mr. OwiTT : “ Will it put an end to the summons court l”
Canvasser: ‘ ‘ Of course
it will. It will
actually stop anyone
prom enforcing pay-
ment."
Mr. Owitt: “ That
settles it. Pm going
to vote ‘ Yes ! ’ "
Replying to a request that the btate
Parliament should be summoned to deal with a
request for more Wages Boards, John Weary un-
intentionally threw mud at his own action in
opposing the Referendum. Said he : “ What is
the use of such Boards if their determinations are
not obeyed?” Exactly! What is the use of
continuing to place industrial regulation in such
feeble, flaccid hands when a competent and
powerful authority like the Commonwealth
Parliament is willing to take over the job?
As forecasted months ago, the Victorian
Government finds itself stumped for land for the
new settlers, and is trying to induce would-be
irrigationists to take up Mallee and other “dry-
farming” blocks. El wood Mead’s settlers are
coming in steadily, and he and his Water Supply
Board are doing the best they can for the trickle;
but they can’t acquire land “ on their own ’’- they
must go to the Closer Settlement Board. And that
body finds the compulsory purchase powers hope-
lessly ineffective, as the House of Fat Landlords,
no doubt, intended they should be.
Willie Watt babbled the other day about
its “being 100 to 1 on the Wages Boards as
against the Arbitration Court.” and that “ the
State Parliament could be called together at any
time and could create 40 or 50 Boards in two
hours.” Whereupon one of the workers’ women
organisers reminded Watt that Boards for a dozen
trades had already been asked for—in some cases
repeatedlv—wherefore she invited him and Weary
to call Parliament together at once and get busy.
Then Watt’s silence was like the stillness of Ice-
berg Irvine, who was the last man to call Parlia-
ment to session in haste. But he didn’t do it to
create Wages Boards. Scarcely !
The recently-formed M.L. Labor party
has started to cut its teeth, and is going to try
their edges at the municipal elections this month
in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and a
number of smaller centres. “Tommy” Taylor,
the “independent” member in Parliament for
Christchurch North, has signed the party pledge,
and is contesting Christchurch city mayoralty.
The other day the Const’toosh’n was al-
most fractured, the marriage-tie rent asunder,
and Capital hounded out of the land because an
inoffensive Scotchman named Carmichael pro-
posed to have a yarn with an old pal of his named
Fuller. One is the departing, the in-
coming, sub-excellency of Victoria, and Carmike
proposed to stay till his successor arrived and give
him a few points on local customs and manners.
But officialdom was aghast; the thing was with-
out Precedent. It was almost as bad as two
claimants to one throne colliding in one back yard.
So Carmichael is going to loiter about in Adelaide
until Fuller arrives, when the pair may yarn and
whisky until the boat leaves. One of the things
that Fisher might explain to the “ men in Down-
ing-street, ” when he speaks with them at Corona-
tion time, is that these absurd State Governors
simply don’t count, and that Australia really
thinks far less of a Mother that imposes them
upon it than it would if she recognised their
superfluousness and authorised the Chief Justice
to do the legal part of the business. The other
part doesn’t want doing.
A vigorous No-No canvas is going on
among the wheat-farmers in way-out N. S. Wales.
Farmers and settlers 5 delegates are telling
them that the proposals are “against their best
interests.” The delegates don’t explain why or
how—which is probably just as well. It might
be awkward, for instance, if the delegates started
to explain what a beautiful thing it would be for
the farmers to have a Trust in the implement
trade, so that they would have the privilege of
paying £lOO for harvesters and £45 for ploughs.
From that great patter comedian, Alfred
Deakin, M.P.:—
It is quite possible that the decision (on the Referenda)
would be given by only a minority of those entitled to
vote. The best antidote to this political lassitude which
my own experience enables me to offer is the presenta-
tion on every occasion of the positive, progressive pro-
gramme of the Liberal party, which comprises measures
adequate to the completion of our Federal Constitution
by the addition of all the powers essential to give it
effective national control of the issues which are sup-
posed to warrant the present inapplicable, injurious and
anti-Federal amendments.
After getting your breath you are entitled to sit
down and ask'where is the “positive, progressive
programme of the Liberal party ” ? The bulk of
the Deakin orators clamor against the Referenda,
but they are as silent about the details of their
amazing Liberal programme as the most taciturn
oyster that ever hung on to its rock at Stewart
Island.
In almost every neighborhood you will find
someone who, during the summer months, had a
severe attack of colic or English cholera, and who
had been put to the most severe suffering before
medicine could be procured or a doctor summoned.
A reliable remedy for this complaint should be
kept at hand. The risk is too great for anyone to
take. Chamberlain’s Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea
Remedy has undoubtedly saved the lives of niore
people and saved more pain and suffering than
anv other medicine in use. It can always be
depended upon for this ailment.*
Strange tales are related of the Willunga
railway poll mS.A. It is said that a dozen men
or more who have long been lying comfortably at
rest under flattering gravestones m Brighton
cemetery, left their beds to vote against giving 1
guarantee that the State demanded before it
would build the line. But even then the Ayes
won by a narrow margin.
Alfred Deakin, who used to be an Aus-
tralian Nationalist, says that “powers should not
be given unless they are to be used. lhe las-
manian Government has power to legislate for
the creation of wages boards, and doesn t use it;
yet Deakin doesn’t want the power taken from
the Tasmanian Government apparently. Vic-
toria has power to make laws for the gaoling of
the baby-murderers who sell rotten or reduced
milk : but it simply sits back and allows such men
to go on putting 4£d. into the poor box. Queens-
land has power to see that the sugar-farmer gets a
decent price for his raw sugar. The power isnt
used ; yet Deakin hasn’t said a word about taking
it away. Still, because the democratic Australian
Government wants more power, Deakin is beg-
ging Australia not to give itself a free hand,
because it mayn’t want to use every ounce of its
new authority. It sounds like bluff. It has the
appearance of bluff. It is bluff.
Replying to Hughes’s remark that the
Commonwealth Government won t necessarily
use all the powers it asks for, Alfred Deakin says
that power shouldn’t be given if it isn t exercised.
On the same principle, of course, power that
isn’t exercised should be withdrawn or resigned.
Under these circumstances The Bulletin is
waiting to hear that A. Deakin, barrister-at-law,
has applied to be disbarred. Alfred has power to
practise and doesn’t practise, wherefore on his
own showing the power to practise should be
taken from him.
Owing to want of foresight on the part of
the great railway expert Tait, Victoria is suffer-
ing from such a shortage of railways trucks that a
scarcity of coal is threatened in Melbourne, and
there is an actual firewood famine. Newport
workshops are said to be building vehicles at top
speed • and now Weary and co. talk of cabling an
order for 1000 trucks. If there must be importa-
tions, what’s wrong with dropping a word in the
rio-ht place that Victoria wants a heap of railway-
barrows and hasn’t enough men to make them as
fast as it wants them ?
IMPROVEMENTS.

And haunts no fair abode ;

A man is kinder when he’s wed

A dog is gayer when he’s fed
And hunts the festive flea.
A horse is safer when he’s old ;

SPORTING
NOTION
The cheerful offer of Clarence Weber to meet
champion slugger Jack Johnson under Greek pancratium
rules has raised a cloud of dust. The excitement over
the Referenda is a trifle compared with it. Under pan-
cratium rules, both men are free to hit or wrestle ; so, in
the long run, Weber’s offer boils down to a proposal to
take Johnson on for a rough-and-tumble to a finish. And
that would not bean edifying spectacle—in fact, it would
be such a brutal exhibition that even the somewhat gory
United States would probably prohibit it. Anyhow, it
would if it were a civilised country. But if a wrestler were
allowed to wrestle only, and the boxer were restricted to
punching, a struggle would throw some light on a dark
question. The trouble is that so much depends upon the
men. Whether boxing or wrestling is the better method
of defence will never be settled. In any case, a contest
of the sort would be unsatisfactory, as the boxer would
wear gloves, but there would be no gloves in a strangle
hold. So to give any true index it would be necessary
for the boxer to wear gloves that weighed about loz.
each. And that again would be descending to brutality.
So, apparently, there is no satisfaction to be got out of
the matter.
As 10,000 argumentative bar-breasters and
sundry newspapers have already pointed out, boxing
as practised is an artificial method of fighting. When
one meets a footpad on a lonely road there is no time-
keeper and no referee to disqualify for hitting below the
belt. But the strongest footpad caught suddenly round
the knees and brought down on the back of his head is out
for keeps. A heavy swing right on the jaw from any man
of ordinary sense would probably have the same soporific
effect. Considering both methods of defence from the
purely utilitarian standpoint, the wrestler has the
advantage in that his art stands to him in the last stage—
that of “ holts.” A boxer who is agile enough to pre-
vent the wrestler getting a hold would, of course, win ;
but in that case it is his speed that saves him and downs
the other fellow ; wherefore the real art of self-defence is
ability to run and side-step. So what’s wrong with teaching
the rising generation to run? Agility, more agility, and
still more agility is what is wanted. When advancing
years make it impossible to show the agility, then it’s
time to take on jiu-jitsu.
Mick Nathan, ex-lightweight boxer, blew into
controversy and told how he had met a gentleman named
Duncan Ross, who, though he ought to have been Scotch-
byterian, was Yankee, in a boxer v. wrestler contest, and
knocked him out in a few minutes. Ross was allowed to
hit as well as wrestle, but apparently didn’t know how.
So the boxer got the best of it. Ross, who was beaten,
weighed 14st., while the boxer scaled only lOst. Which
meant that boxer Nathan undoubtedly had more agility,
and was able to keep out of the way of his heavier adver-
sary. It was very interesting ; but it threw no light on
what would have happened had Nathan met a wrestler of
his own weight and nimbleness.

The aftermath of the ladies’ sculling match.
Miss Ryan was accused of having used a sliding seat,
whereas the conditions stipulated that the race should
be rowed with fixed seats. To the accusation, Peter
Kemp, who trained Miss Ryan, gave an indignant denial.
But his explanation of how the “mistake” occurred
bangs Banagher. Miss Ryan wore Canadian knickers,
and the back part of them was made of leather,
which had been polished and made slippery by
treatment with blacklead, or something of that sort.
On to the seat of the skiff was screwed a board, which
bad likewise been made slippery. And on this the lady
slid just as easily as if she had been in a sliding seat;
nevertheless, it is tri v ' ~.iantly claimed that the articles
were faithfully adhered to. The only result of the ex-
planation is to enounce the glory of Miss Lewis’s win,
for, although the articles may have been kept in the
letter, there is a grave doubt whether they weren’t badly
fractured in the spirit.

Sydney First Grade cricket’s 10th round came
to an end on Saturday and provided some surprises.
The struggle between the leading clubs, Redfern and
Gordon, was the hub of public attention. On the pre-
vious Saturday Gordon had piled up 237, and Redfern
had accumulated 28 for the loss of one wicket. On this
Saturday Redfern struck trouble in the shape of a long
succession of single-figure scores ; and although Emery,
who carried his bat, made a great stand, his solid 83
could not save his side, which disappeared for 199, leaving
a margin of 38 in favor of Gordon on the first innings. At
one time Redfern had seven wickets down for only 83, and
it looked like a rot and a rout.. But Emery then put in an
appearance, and aided by Kerim, of Palestine, who made
34, the outlook lost some of its horror. All the same,
Redfern, like the turtle, got into the soup at the last.
Three centuries lent a glory to the cricketers’
afternoon sunlight. The owners were Norman Deane
(North Sydney), who piled up 162 ; P. Newton (Padding-
ton), who carried his bat for 123, and then saw his side
make only a draw'of it; and R. B. Minnett (University),
who smacked up 123 also.
Redfern’s downfall placed Gordon at the top of
the poll with 14 competition points to Redfern’s 12, Uni.
running third with 11. After that, single figures above
and below zero, except in the case of Middle Harbor,
which has distinguished itself by getting 10 behind
nothing. North Sydney downed Central Oumbeiland
with a margin of 188 runs. Petersham, having totted up
286, was disgusted to find that Glebe managed to
keep the evil hour off long enough to make a draw' of it
with 233 for eight w'ickets. Which was g>ood generalship,
anyhow. Burwood overwhelmed Waverley by 68 runs —204
to 272. Paddington, with its little 255, never had a hope
against University, which lashed up 436, leaving 118 to
sp ire. The defeat of Sydney, which wasanticipat* d, was
made real by Middle Harbor scoring 196 to Sydney’s 156.
Strange how some people can perform when the day of
grace has fled ! Sydney, back at the sticks in the second
innings, which did not affect, the match, promptly smote
up 163 (seven more than it made in the first innings) for
the loss of five w'ickets. But life was ever thus I

“J.G.”: Re curious ways of getting out at
cricket (B. 23/3/T1), Years ago, when I fancied I could
play well enough to be in the Aus. XI, I w'as batting at
Ballarat. Getting a loose ball from the local Spofforth,
I banged it with the intention of smashing the boundary
fence. The hall, however, made straight for the umpire
at leg and hit the bat he was holding, then struck square
leg, and rebounded on to the wicket, and finally was
caught by point. Meanwhile, I was streaking for the
other end, and both my partner and I were out of the
crease when the ball hit the wicket. In a few minutes a
terrific dispute was raging as to whether it was a case of
run out or caught out, or whether the ball was dead after
it hit the umpire, so that neither of us were out. A
policeman settled it —I forget how.

The Australasian Lawn Tennis Association finds
itself very comfortable, thank you. The assets stand at
£435, with no liabilities; and the visit of the over-seas
notabilities towards the end of the year, when the Davis
Cup will be lost and won, will bring more grist to
the mill. The N.S.W. Association, however, is in
a bad plight. The liabilities tot up to the sombre
amount of £357, and, as treasurer T. P. Carr
puts it, the “ Association has no provision for
an overdraft, all the assets being mortgaged.” In other
words, the Association is dead broke. A committee has
been formed to consider ways and means, and the Sydney
Club has handed over to it the right to control the State
Championships, a concession that will bring a few
sovereigns to the Association’s fainting purse. As for
the debenture-holders, they are smiling between out-
bursts of appropriate language.

Aubrey Faulkner not only did not return to
South Africa with the other cricketers, but likes this
country so much that he is hard at work looking for land
to take up. The only doubt—it may have been decided
by this time—is whether Vic. or N.S.W. will get the
benefit of his spare moments. The news will be a horrid
jar to Africa. What it will do in England in 1912 without
the backbone of its XI is hard to imagine. Even for its
recent Australian tour, it had to send for Llewellyn,
who has been an English county player for years. As it
seems to be settled that no man shall play in Test matches
for more than one country—as witness Crawford’s idle-
ness during the recent series, though he is now a bona-
fide Australian resident—Faulkrier’s big cricket is pre-
sumably at an end. This is a pity, for if an absolutely
representative XI were being chosen at the present
moment—say the sporting fixture of This World against
the Next —Faulkner would be one of the certainties.

The N.S.W. Ladies’ Amateur Swimming As-
sociation, which is horrified at the idea of men spectators
at women’s swimming races, is in holts with the Public
Schools’ Association. The schools had their annual carni-
val last month, and men spectators were present, the
Schools’ Association having followed their usual practice
of years past. Now the Association has warned all affili-
ated clubs that all its members who took part in this
carnival have been suspended, and if any club or clubs
allow any of these immodest persons to race in club
events the whole club will be disqualified. The Wowser-
ess Association, having gone this far, should go farther.
Lavender Bay is one of the Association’s chief centres,
and the swimmers in the baths are in full view of the
male passengers in the passing trains. It is reasonable to
suppose that rude men have at one time or other gazed
at every member of the Association. So the obvious
course to adopt is for the Association to disqualify itself
holus-bolus, and the difficulty will thus promptly end
itself.

Probably the best story of the hundreds
that could be told of the lately-deceased Victorian turf
identity, A. F. Bradshaw, is associated with his pro-
prietorship of the Richfield (Vic.) suburban racecourse.
The V.R.O. had raised the minimum amount of stake
money to be raced for per day at a meeting. Bradshaw
got round the difficulty by adding the Yellow Hammer
Stakes to his programme, and appropriating to it about
half the value of the day’s prize money. Only horses
sired by Yellow Hammer (Bradshaw’s own property) were
eligible, and there were only two of them. Bradshaw
owned one and a friend owned the other !

Motorists are rejoicing, for the Dunlop Rubber
00. has announced a reduction of 15 per cent, in the
price of motor tyres, which means 3s. in the £. The re-
duction is due to a fall in the price of Para rubber,
which has slumped to 7s. per lb.

If Westralia succeeds with the fund now being
raised to send Finlay, the 220yds. breast-stroke champion
of Australia, to the Festival of Empire, Australasia will
be fairly well represented. Champion has left Maoriland
for the hub of the earth, and Hardwick, of N.S.W., is
also afloat. These two will have to decide which of them
is the better man, as only one representative is allowed in
each event. Champion left his Maoriland shore in a
blaze of glory, having covered 880yds. in llmin. 37 4-ssec.,
a feat which convinced the ricketty isles that the local
Champion is The One.
The motor invasion hits in all sorts of curious
ways. For instance, Adelaide Zoo complains bitterly
that, it cannot get enough broken-down horses for its
carnivora to eat since the horse-drawn vehicles have
been so largely superseded. Even the jackals are not yet
educated up to dining off a section of condemned rubber
tyre. Apparently the only thing to be done is to fill the
gap with broken-down chauffeurs and those convicted of
furious driving.

The fact that Douglas Mawson is taking with
him to Antarctica—if he can raise the money to go at all
—a two-seated aeroplane, suggests that the race of
daredevils is not yet extinct. One could understand him
taking some sort of dirigible ; but an aeroplane ! An
aeroplane is at the merey of a mere gust, while a dirigible
can at least run before a storm, although the bulk of the
storms in Antarctica appear to be altogether over the
odds. Moreover, petrol is always liable to freeze in that
awful temperature, or, rather, lack of it. And the
slightest stoppage of the engine means death to that
aeroplane’s reckless crew, for if the fall did not prove
fatal the cold would, unless they escaped scot free. The
aeroplane is to have a petrol capacity equal to 180 miles
—equal to 90 miles out and back again ; and in a somewhat
lonely place like Antarctica a fellow can get into a lot of
trouble in 90 miles. Mawson certainly ought to take a
dirigible on which to do the rescue act in the almost
certain event of the aeroplane breaking down. And,
anyhow, is the old Pole worth it all, or worth even half of
it all?

George Gray’s natural preference for making
his losing hazards off the red rather than off the white
ball is likely to rationalise billiards still further by bring-
ing about an alteration in the score values of hazards
and cannons. Nobody knows why a cannon or a scoring
transaction with the opponent’s ball is worth only two,
whilst a hazard with the red is worth three. There
never was a reason for the discrepancy, except that it
had existed for ages. Next time the rules of billiards are
amended, the cannon will probably be raised to three in
value, and the hazard with the red reduced to two. Or
if this is left at three, the white hazard will be raised to
its level. Why not?

The Hawkesbury autumn meeting indicated
that the ancient club has weathered the glacial age that
descended on it after the smash of the boom, and is re-
viving rapidly. Saturday last saw probably a record
crowd on the course, and some excellent racing. The
club is blessed with about the best racecourse manager in
Australia, Mr. C. S. Guest. The proceedings were marred
by one accident, in the Two-Yt-ar-Old Handicap. Wool
(what a name for a horse !) fell and smashed his rider’s
collarbone. No horses were injured.
Followers of form concentrated a lot of atten-
tion on the Autumn Handicap, for every one of the nine
starters is likely to be a trier in the Doncaster and Syd-
ney Cup, or one at least of these two classic and recently
re-gilded plums. Flavinius and Sandbath took the popu-
lar eye most at 9 to 2 and 3to 1 against. Apple Pie,
which, with Eric, had gone out at sevens, immediately
dashed to the front, and went like the wind, with Some-
thing Irish and Mil in hot pursuit. The two favorites
were far to the rear, but the second-last horse of the
bunch was Eric. At the straight, Flavinius was running
second, but at the half distance the field, coming with a
tremendous rush, closed right up. Then Eric and
Adagio, who had hitherto chased the others along, came
round on the outside with a great sweep, passed the
bunch, and dashed into first and second places in that
order. Sandbath was third. Eric won by half a length,
and Adagio beat Sandbath by the same distance ; so it
was a fairly close thing, and the Scriptures were fulfilled
by the last being first.

The latest effort of “conscience’’ beats all
records. Recently the record-breaker with a load on his
mind sent along £5 to a Melbourne bookmaker, with a
note to the effect that Ikey Moses had overpaid this
amount. Ikey’s friends hope that the double shock will
not prove fatal. It is an article of most religions that to
take down a bookmaker is no sin, and one or two, rather
more sensible than the rest, regard it as a virtue. This
fellow is evidently a degenerate.
The scratching of Blairgonr for the Doncaster
Handicap last week was one of the pills which should
remove an inclination on the part of the public to try to
make money by backing gee-gees. The brute was brought
to Sydney for auction sale, and the new owner, after
careful inspection, decided that he was not fit to run ih
the race, and accordingly scratched him. Blairgour has
been the popular fancy for months, and is now one leg of
innumerable doubles and the subject of a fearsome crowd
of straight-out bets at long odds. The introduction of
the Tote at least would save the fool public from this sort
of spoliation.

A feature at the Sydney Show is the Russell
aerial colt-catcher. From a post in the centre of the
ring an arm rotates so as to cover any portion of it. The
breaker is located in a sling depending from this arm,
and sweeping round he catches the colts from above,
without the danger that he would have to face in catch-
ing them from the ground. The man’s superiority is so
thoroughly demonstrated that the horse seems to give in
at once, and is captured without anv ferocious struggle
to damage the animal’s nerves and ruin his temper. Also
it accustoms the neddies to being handled in slings for
transhipment on to steamers, railway-boxes and so forth ;
and altogether it seems to be a big improvement on the
old and somewhat brutal style of doing things.

The daily papers announce that the ancient and
dishonorable profession of “ whispering ” is to be abolished
at Randwick (Sydney) by some ground alterations. But
there is nothing in it. “Whispering” will go on merrily
as long as mugs attend races ; and the supply of mugs
seems like the mercy of God—inexhaustible and infinite.
“ Whispering,” be it known, is a humorous arrangement
by which a number of more or less disreputable small
boys and unshaven youths make a gullible, public keep
them for nothing. The “whisperer” is supposed
to have inside knowledge born of companion-
ship with the jockeys and stable-boys, and he im-
parts it on the understanding that, if the tip
comes off, he will get a small cut of the sugar-plums
won from theinnocent, bookmaker. And he always does.
If there are six horses in a field of 20 that have a reason-
able show, he tips the whole six to six separate mugs,
giving each mug a different horse. And whichever one
has backed the winner, the “whisperer” sticks to like a
guilty conscience. It must take some smartness to keep
the six mugs in view ; but, somehow, the “whisperer"
detective system seems to be infallible, as the mug never
escapes paying his toll. The new arrangements will
certainly have one good effect. In future the public
will not be able to surround the jockeys as they go to
mount, and the world will be saved the disgraceful exhi-
bition of smartly-dressed females ogling and ear-wigging
the disgusted horsemen for tips as they file to the course.

Sydney Metropolitan Rugby Union is not dead,
nor sleeping; but it is going to have a very quiet year
indeed. Economy is the order of the day, and it is going
to be of a very stark nature. Players will not be
insured, unless they pay their own premiums, or the
clubs do it for them ; guernseys will not be supplied free
as of yore : and even the number of clubs is to be re-
duced, Sydney District being wiped off the football map.
The only outside event will be the match with Queens-
land, and though there is some talk of a Maoriland team
coming over towards the end of the season, no one
expects to see it. Meanwhile, the selectors are busy
picking and choosing, or finding men to fill the gaps in
the ranks. The gaps appear to he unusually large.
The Rugby League, on the other hand, is put-
ting forward a most alluring programme, and one that is
expected to knock the recent successful season into a
cocked hat. Maoriland and Queensland will both call in
and make for sport and big gates ; but what tickles the
players’ palates most is that gorgeous trip to Britain to
play the Northern Union. The Kangaroos will number
26, and will be picked from the players who show up best
between the start of the competitions, on the last Satur-
day of this month, and August 5, when they will board
the steamer. The chief danger ahead of the League just
now is that disastrous complaint known as swelled head.
By that sin fell the angels. True, our Leaguers are not
all angels.
Apparently, the Soccer people found that last
year they had spread themselves out rather thinly;
hence four whole divisions of the metropolis are wiped
out and joined to others, so that the number of First
Grade teams drops from 12 to eight. This would not
appear to be a slump, but due merely to an honest
endeavor to consolidate the game by having larger and
wealthier clubs. Football is, or.rather was, threatening
to become top-heavy in Sydney.

Saturday was a sweltering day in Sydney, and
the people who were not seeking reputation at the noble
game of’oofball felt sorrv for the grimy, sweating, half-
roasted footballers who were playing their practice
matches. But it was a splendid day for shifting surplus
tissue, and the way those ’bailers left their original
dimensions was very gratifying. The whole eight clubs
of the League were abroad, and put in a strenuous after-
noon. The possibilities of getting into the English-
touring team spurred them on tCMioble deeds.
The Australian League footballers are going to
boom in Sydney this year. H. R. Denison, who started
the game in VVestralia 27 years ago, has again turned his
attention to it, and with his aid the League has secured
the freehold of the old Rosebery Park Racecourse, which
is an ideal ground for the purpose. But the body is
about to sustain a severe loss t hrough the departure of
J. J. Virgo, who made the Y.M.C.A. a collection
of manly young fellows and a credit to any city.
Virgo goes to London to be a large dog in the Y.M.C.A.
in that wintry land, and threatens to establish the Aus-
tralian game there. And Virgo is a man who has a knack
of keeping his promises. For years he has been vice-
president of the League, and it will miss him.

The action of the Ladies’ Swimming Associa-
tion moved the secretary of the Public Schools body to
do a cruel thing. In his mirth he told the truth, and
pointed out with barbaric frankness that “ ladies over a
certain age never swim,” because mostly they dare not be
seen in swimming' costume. Also, he pointed out that the
action of the L.S.A. is merely the first act in a tragedy of
suicide, for if the Ladies will not admit to membership an v
school girl who takes part in the schools carnivals, it will
practically have to import all new members* The Public
Schools body has done most valuable work, and, through
it, thousands and thousands of girls have been taught
and encouraged to swim, with the result that they are of
finer type and better development than the frumps "’bo
had not the advantage of swimming In early girlhood.
Now the Ladies’ Swimming Association is squirming, it
never expected such beastly straight talk from so mild-
mannered a man as secretary Lappin.

Old Dick Coombes, off to the Coronation blow-
out as manager of the Australasian Athletic Teatn, has
had more to contend with during the last few weeks than
in all the rest of the 28 years he has beeh mixed up with
amateur athletics. Banquets, presentations, stnoke con-
certs and such like have fallen on the quiet, unassuming
manager, until his sleep is haunted with nightmares
of large bottles and floods of oily words. Coombes owns
up to having won 160 prizes at sport, and Australia owes
much to his sound knowledge of the games he has taken
an interest in.

Lacrosse, which promises big things in Sydney
this winter, is better off in cash and members than ever
before in its 28 years’history. Three new cluhs will be
added to the first-grade competition, and two extra'
clubs will join in the second-grade struggle. Inter-State
teams will also liven the game up considerably, and,
generally, lacrosse players are beginning to regard them-
selves as among the salt of the earth. The real question
is where all these clubs and increased numbers are to find
biffing grounds. Looks as though sundry streets will
have to be closed to traffic to give room for sport.

Adelong (N.S.W.) saw a horrible sight last
week, when the most revolting “contest" on re-
cord earned its promoters the heaviest sentence
possible for cruelty to animals. A. local reptile-
fancier challenged Australia to produce a snake with
more venom to the square inch than his pet “ tiger,” and
put up £2O to show his challenge was genuine. A
Cooma man heard the challenge, and rushed the
offer with a 6ft. Murray coppa, or some such reptile.
Rabbits were introduced as the third party to the argu-
ment. It was a one-snake affair, as the “ tiger’s” bite
killed the rabbit in 2£ minutes, while the bite of Kelly’s
reptile took four hours to prove fatal. This sort of thing
deserves attention at the hands of the police.

COMSTOCK’S NERVE AND BONE
LINIMENT
Is a powerful penetrating preparation, which acts
through the pores of the skin on the nerves, bone
and muscles. It possesses the marvellous pro-
perties of an immediate pain-killer, and is un-
equalled as a remedy for the pains and aches to
which human beings are subject, and which'only
an external remedy can relieve.
It overcomes all pains and aches by relieving
the effect on the delicate nerves, causing the cir-
culation of the blood to be fully maintained
through the injured part. It is an invaluable
remedy for sprains and for reducing all swellings,
which under its influence become softened and
disappear.
Rheumatism, sciatica and lumbago all yield to
the powerful, penetrating and conquering proper-
ties of this liniment if used in connection with Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills, according to directions.
For stiff joints, neuralgia, lame back, scalds,
burns, contracted muscles and painful swellings it
will be found that Comstock’s Nerve and Bone
Liniment has no equal. It prevents severe blister-
ing, and draws the burning sensation from burns
and scalds, and averts discoloration of the skill
from bruises.
Comstock’s Nerve and Bone Liniment may he
obtained at all the leading chemists, or will he
forwarded by mail (post paid) at the same price,
2s. fid. per bottle (6 bottles 13s. fid.). Address—

THE: HILL-CLIMB at KOWEN
GOES TO A “TRIUMPH.”
At Kowen Hill, Que.inbeyan, Mr. T. A. Trotter, on a 3£-h.p. TRIUMPH
recently won a very stiff hill climb. Competition was keen, too,
there being a specially built racer in the event.
Two other “ TRIUMPHS ” also put up a fine run in this test, and one
of them only lost the championship by a second. Suppose you
call and see one. Our Pitt Street Depdt is open till 9 p.m. on
Fridavs for those men who cannot call during’ the day.

Sole Agent 9 for “Triumph ” in N.S.W., 234- Pitt Street, and Castlereagh Street, Sydney.
“Thomas Spook”: Spotswood (Vic.)
owns a little weatherboard chapel which believes
in the sweet uses of advertisement. Over its
entrance, in huge silver letters on a background of
blue, is painted the notice : “Prepare to Meet
Thy God ! ” I saw this notice through a railway-
carriage window; and, being pressed for time, I
could not alight and examine the other notices
which I feel sure must be there. For instance :
“ The best preparatory establishment in Victoria.
Only the best instructors kept. No. of passes for
1910, 365J —minimum fee, 3d. a week. Principal,
Rev. William Traybitt, D.D. Read Our Refer-
ences.”
A few days ago passengers on the Mil-
dura (Vic.) train were amazed at the sight of a
herd of about 50 deer close to the line between
Otiryo and Birchip. This is away up in the Nor’-
West, on the fringe of the rnallee, and a couple
of hundred miles or so from where any deer were
supposed to be. How they got there is a mystery.
There are herds of them about the coastal dis-
tricts of Gippsland—but that is 250 miles off.
Previously in good seasons they have been
known to make small incursions inland ; and
apparently the extra-good season has enticed
them further afield than they ever got before.

THERE are Pure Food Laws and Pure
Beverage Laws for the protection of
the people of Australia to-day.
Chateau Tanunda Brandy is distilled
under the direct control of the Federal
Government, and from the time the
grape juice leaves the presses until the
Brandy is thoroughly matured the Com-
monwealth officers watch every process
IN YOUR INTEREST.
The presence of that u G.R.” label on
the bottle means that your Government
guarantees the contents to be distilled
WHOLLY FROM GRAPE WINE by
a pot still, and that the Brandy has been
matured by storage in wood for a period
of not less than two years.
In no other part of the world is Brandy
made under conditions that offer such
complete protection to the consumer.
Ask for Chateau Tanunda—the pure
Australian Standard Brandy.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will he
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted, whether sent by post or handed
in; and no MS. will be returned unless stamps
(of any State) accompany.
T. J.M.: Neat; but there is very little
market here for parodies. .. .P. Random: Thanks;
but they are iiqt new thoughts, nor old thoughts told
in a new way. .. . M.: Now, what ditch are you trying
to drag us into? The performance was noticed —■
and noticed quite as well as it deserved —in the
dailies I. Rad: Quite unsuitable, some be-
cause it’s too old, but most because it’s too green.
...Jack Jay: If proceedings in Chambers have been
open to the Maoriland press for so many years,
why was the exception made in that particular
ease? You don’t make it clear, and it is the most
interesting point.... Ealyn: That automobile story
is smart; and we hadn't heard it—for some time.
....Sparker: Depends what you call a “slight em-
bellishment.” • The point of the yarn is an able-
bodied steal. .. .Worsley: No, Clever man; but
we know a few which can’t be got after the arrival
of each mail. . . .Bareoo (Q.) : Story written in glim-
mering indelible pencil declined without any regrets
....Waring: You say nothing that is worth saying
until you reach the end —and then you say something
that would have been better left unsaid. Story now
taking the count in the basket...E. Wilder: Unsuit-
able. .. .J. & K. A.: No spray or foam in the sea
verses. .. .E.T.R.: The sonnet is full of earthquakes,
high winds and crashing tempests; and for the sake
of the widow who has her mite invested in an in-
surance office, we’ve tied it down in the basket....
Bellerive: The broad-arrow person may have a run
for his life:
THE EX-CONVICT’S REVENGE.
Not a breath of wind did ruffle the trees
And the stars shone clear and bright.
As a squire reclined in his easy-chair
On his varandah one summer night,
When before him appeared a ragget tramp
Whose cheeks were worn and pale,
A poor disgarded innocent man
H e had sent for five years to gaol;
We meet at last, exclaimed the tattered wretch,
I’ve watched and waited all Day,
And he fastened upon his enemy’s throat
Like a tiger upon its prey.
The victim writhed convulsively
In the grip of the convict grim,
When the servants appeared upon the scene
He had choked the life out of him.
The miscreant slouched among the trees
In horror and guilty despair.
While with glaring eyes and contorted brow
The squire lie dead in his chair.
...W. Wills: Futile attempt to be funny... Bury the
Pen: Well, why don’t you?... .Spillpenny: Story
creaks along like a heavy coach up a bad hill road,
and finally breaks down miles from a climax
R.S.T.: You may have four lines wherewith to hang
yourself:
Yes 1 Yes I No 1 No ! Can it be so ?
It really seems familiar;
In days of old, ore kings were bold,
I’ve heard of something similar.
Guess you must have lost your rhyming ear in a rail-
way accident. .. .F.O. (Sydney): Hardly good enough
... .Stiggins: Doesn’t get us. .. .Rene R.: Sorry can-
not, find room for “The Phantom of Despair.”....
Tahuna : P’airly poor work.... Bushwhacker: Treat-
ment not powerful enough. .. Hal B.: Think the pre-
vious attempt must have been better. .. .Jane Dale:
Cannot use either... .Spuds: Heavy-footed foolscap
humor. It is a strange thing, but the writer who
uses foolscap is almost invariably long-winded. There
is some deadly influence in the tombstone-like slab
of paper... .J.8.C.: Betting chatter not sufficiently
interesting... . J.C.M.: Too slight, and the handling
doesn’t help it F.G.L.: Some day we will put a
stop to this sort of thing:
And trembling like a Leaf, she said
“I was in such a state!
I dreamt I seen you lying down dead
By the hut near the blasted gum.”
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
W.M.K.: Local interest only; the B. wants things
that will be looked at with equal interest in Thursday
Island and Fremantle. . . .
“Singemoine” : According to Sydney
Evening News, “ a census-collector asked a Do-
main dosser, ‘What is your religion? ’ ‘Scotch,’
he replied, and went to sleep again.” What mag-
nificent frankness ! We all of us have two re-
ligions : (1) the real (“Scotch,” beer, rum, or
girls, as the case may he); (2) the bogus (Wowser-
ism. Primitive Methodism, Imperialism or what
not). One of the things that will stamp the 1911
census on my memory for all time is the fact that
the authorities had to go, Diogenes-like, with a
lantern, to a damp, wind-swept cave, to find the
only really honest man in the community.
Thus Frank Dilnot, in London Daily
Mail, on William Archer Redmond (who
reaches Australia in a day or two), his maiden
speech, and the Redmond family generally :
He looked indeed the son of his father as he sat there
frowning with nervousness with a bundle of notes in his
hand, crossing and uncrossing his legs as he waited for
the opportunity which was so long in coining. He has
his father’s bold, hawklike nose, his square jaw, his
determined mouth, and there is the Irish Leader’s ex-
pression in his eyes. The resemblance would be pheno-
menal were it not that in place of the grey hair, thinning
rapidly, of his father, he has a luxuriant mass of dark
hair. When the Speaker at last called on him he rose
amid enthusiastic cheers from the Nationalists and
plunged at once into his facts and arguments. He
spoke fluently, but with just a trace of awkwardness,
which will disappear when lie becomes accustomed to his
environment. His voice is a strange blend of his father’s
and his uncle’s. Mr. John Redmond had a place at the
end of the bench in the comparative obscurity of the gal-
lery ; and one could imagine his emotions as he leaned for-
ward to lose no word of his son’s first speech. Mr. William
Redmond came hurrying in from the Lobby and stood at
the Bar listening to the young man with an expression of
happy reflectiveness. As to the members in general,
they divided their attention between father, uncle and
nephew. Everybody had temporarily forgotten Home
Rule, and for once in a way politics were far from the
minds of all.
Now it is , the Premier of France who is
introducing legislation to prevent trade mono-
polies,' the bossefi of the local alcohol trade being
suspected of a scheme to corner the market.
From everywhere in these days we hear of the
wicked Socialists interfering with Private Enter-
prise ; and no wonder the representative stout
gentleman pauses between his third and fourth
muffin at breakfast to remark that things are
coming to a pretty pass.
By one of those coincidences which will
insist on occurring, London Punch published re-
cently a cartoon of Balfour standing by the grave
of Preferential Trade, on the very day that his
younger brother, Eustace, died. Editor Seaman
expressed his regrets through the daily press, and
showed that the cartoon had been decided on 10
days before. Eustace was manager of the vast
Grosvenor estate, in London. The difficulty for
PUNCH would have been more awkward if he had
died the day before publication. It would have
been a very big thing to have suppressed the
number \ yet .su.ch things have been done—-a whole
edition of “ Whitaker’s Almanac ” was once sacri-
ficed because of a serious error.

ONCE=A-WEEK PIANO TALKS
One of the essentials in the construction of high-grade pianos is carefully-
selected and thoroughly-seasoned timber. For this purpose the services of
timber specialists are required. Our specialists examine every piece, accepting
only perfect planks.
DRIED and SEASONED timber are not synonymous terms. Timber
may be dried rapidly at the expense of developing cracks, but that is not
SEASONED ; because the sap is forced out and the timber is left porous
instead of the particles drawing together and consolidating, thus rendering it
subject to expansion or contraction by every change of temperature.
The timber used in BEALE High-Grade PIANOS is first of all
matured for years in the open air, protected from the sun and rain, and is then
finished gradually on scientific principles in patented seasoning kilns. By this
means it is properly SEASONED, and will remain straight and fiat for all time.
The Hon. Sir Arthur Rutledge, K.C.M.G., ex-Attorney-General of
Queensland, on visiting our factories, said: —-
“That which interested me most, as I thoroughly understand the subject, is the apparatus
and system for seasoning timber. Not merely is the timber exposed to the air, under cover, for
years, but, above all, the perfect method of uniform extraction of the sap without injuring the fibres
will enable the wood to resist all climatic influences. It is the only perfect system I have met with
in Australia, and 1 was not aware until to-day that it existed amongst us. Messrs. Beale and Go.
are enabled to use in Australia patents for timber seasoning which are elsewhere mutually exclusive.
Hence the complete success.”
Further, timber to be used in a tropical climate should be SEASONED
in a tropical climate. It is not to be expected that timber seasoned in, say,
Germany (where for months in the year there are heavy rains, snow, ice and
bitter cold), could withstand the high temperatures of Australia as well as
timber seasoned in this climate.
But in addition to all this, the cabinetwork of BEALE High-Grade
PIANOS is constructed on a patented system of cross-plies, which we have
already described, and which of itself is sufficient to render warping or crack-
ing impossible in any climate.
You are cordially invited to call and inspect the New Models of BEALE High-Grade PIANOS.
They are of excellent workmanship, the materials used throughoutare of high quality, and the tone is delightful.

ANTINEURASTHIN
and Nervous Breakdown.
ln nervous breakdown the brain and nerve cellsmust be
FED, and not stimulated by medicines in the form of
tonics or sedatives, which give temporary relief, but can-
not effect permanent improvement.
Ij cithin is the ONLY substance by which the brain
and nerves can be nourished ; and it is Lecithin which
the system requires in all cases of neurasthenic condi-
tions. (Nervous Disorders, Dyspepsia, Neuralgia, Brain
Fag, Insomnia, Depression, Insanity, etc.) If the brain
and nerves can be supplied sufficiently with Lecithin the
cure is certain ; Antineurasthin supplies that substance
and effects the cure.
ANTINEURASTHIN is the ONLY known preparation
containing an effective percentage of Lecithin in an
active organic state, completely assimilable, and with its
valuable principles undiminished in any way.
A sample of Antineurasthin, together with a valuable
treatise on Nervous Disorders, will be despatched by
return of mail by the Wholesale Distributor for Australia

“Woomelang” re the quality of Victorian tweeds.
More than 30 years ago Albion (Vic.) productions
were being sold in Collins-street as best West-of-
England, and prices on that basis were paid by the
“nothing colonial” crowd. The same crowd is not
yet any wiser so long as the hat-band *or boot-tag
or trouser-button is branded “Made in England,” or
some other place that isn’t Australia. The Union
Mill at Geelong was started with the view of crush-
ing the Victorian industry, and for some years after
its foundation turned out shoddy, which was offered
by the “no Australia” crowd whenever Geelong
tweed vvas asked for. But the other three mills
wore this “no Australia” prejudice down, whereupon
the Union (now Collins) saw the error of its ways,
and the profit to be made by turning out the genuine
article. Since that change came over it, it has helped
to show what can be done by Australians in Aus-
tralia. As to there being anything wrong with the
Victorian article, the fact that for many months
past all the 10 Victorian mills have been working
overtime, and that a new one has just started in
John Weary’s town (Warrnambool), makes it look
as if the public doesn’t think there’s anything
wrong, anyhow.
* * * *
“0.K.”: Talking of the baked wheat industry
lately started in Melbourne, one point was over-
looked in a Bulletin “Plain English.” The food-
stuff in question—“Crispies” by name—is produced
by machinery made almost entirely in Australia;
and this fact, that special machinery is needed, may
explain why the manufacture of fancy wheats has
not previously been undertaken hereabouts. No
doubt also the Yankee firms’ profuse advertising has
helped to scare opposition away; for the retailer not
unnaturally prefers to handle goods whose alleged
virtues are shrieked into the public’s ear half a
dozen times a day. In Melbourne, at any rate, one
has to bully the retailer into supplying an order for
the locally manufactured wheat. True, it is con-
sideraby cheaper than the well-advertised foreign
brands; but as that probably means less profit for
the grocer, it doesn’t make him any the more eager to
push it. Still, he’s a reasonable person, as a rule
accustomed to weighing things, and when some of
his customers demand local wheatmeats in preference
to imported ditto, he will begin to speak kindly
about the goods.
* * * *
Luck has lately stuck doggedly to one Hansen, of
New South Wales. In a ballot for a Bananaland
block he won, and took possession of the little piece
of Australia. But a birthday-book put the show
away—-Hansen wasn’t of age. The matter got to the
ears of the Lands Office, and Hansen had to quit.
Then the land was thrown open again; but it hap-
pened that the matter was hung up just long enough
to let him have his 21st birthday. He accordingly
dropped in another application, and, winning in that
too, hastened back to the old love.
“Te Babarantiko”: Most people picture the South
Sea Island trader as a bold, bad man, something
a la cowboy of the Deadwood Dick type, ever ready
with revolver and rifle. The present-day trader
isn’t anything of the kind, sad to say. Circum-
stances are very much against him. The chief cir-
cumstance is himself. There are too many of him
in all Pacific Islands groups, and more of him in
the New Hebrides than elsewhere. In a district
where two traders would make a comfortable living
(not amass enough wealth to be burdensome, mind
you), one almost invariably finds from three to five.
The result is fierce jealousy, lying and belittling of
each other to the natives, and resorting to tricks so
mean and paltry one wonders if they really are
white men, after all, despite their color. That they
are under the natives’ thumb is, therefore, inevit-
able—the nigger is boss all right. For any white
trader to offend the noble native seems death as far
as his business is concerned—he’d be tabooed right
away. Instead of combining to stop the niggers’ in-
solence, the trader is apt to run to the Resident
Commissioner for redress against grievances entirely
of his own making, the remedy for which lies in his
own hands, and which no sane man would worry any
Government with.
ANY JAMES TO ANY JOHN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
John, ’tis true charity surpasseth knowl’ge, know-
l’ge is science, cultiv. purity of mind. Your bro.
James. — From “Personal and Missing Friends” col.
of daily paper.
John, I must own that I received your letter
And read your most unbrotherly appeal:
You seem quite to forget you are my debtor
And owe me—well, I’ve lent you a great deal.
But let that pass; I fear I shall not see it;
These money-matters cause me only pain ;
If the Lord wills, I lose it—then so be it:
I beg you’ll not refer to it again!
But, John, I have good counsel now to send you—
Advice worth thousands, if it be applied ;
Was I not ever ready to befriend you ?
Did I not do so when our mother died ?
You used to think my zeal for eliurch-work
“funny”—
It would surprise you what the Lord has done I
The reason 1 inherited the money
Was just because I was a model son.
You write that Charity surpasseth Knowledge ;
No doubt, but what are either to a church f
You can’t blame me — l kept you on at college,
Some brothers would have left you in the lurch!
You never go to church—l’ve heard you say so ;
Too much to wine and women you’re inclined—
Oh, shocking! What is worse, you never pray, so
That proves to me you have a godless mind.
You hint that this time you are in great trouble;
“A hole,” you say, and add “my cash is short —
By great bad luck I barely missed a double
Which would have made me. . . Oh, this
wicked sport
Will be your ruin, John! Why will you perish?
If you could be like me, John, you would find
A higher and a holier hope to cherish,
And cultivate true purity of mind.
You know I’ve always tried to be a Beacon—•
A Better Influence—to your wild youth;
It is, of course, the province of a deacon
Whose life is dedicated to the Truth—
Ah, blessed Truth ! I wish, John, that you knew it—
The living Word that comforts and sustains
In this dark Vale, and helps, as we go through it,
To lift us from all thought of earthly gains!
I cannot —as a churchman and a draper—
Assist you in your wicked course of sin.
Suppose the story got into the paper?
My deaeonship would not be worth a pin!
No, .John! I bear a spotless reputation
While you, it seems, have stooped almost to crime;
I cast you off! although you’re a relation,
For sacrifice, if painful, is sublime.
1 fear your backsliding will bring disaster
Upon you and your family affairs,
Yet /, as a meek follower of the Master,
Will not forget you in my humble prayers.
Oh, let this be a source of consolation '
And like a fire, or wind, your hard heart search—
A brother with a blemished reputation
Is prayed for by a deacon of the church!
God bless you, John! But, ere this letter’s ended,
I must express once more my deep, deep pain
At finding that a brother I befriended,
And lent a hundred pounds to, asks again l
But let it go: lam content to lose it—
Thy Will, O Lord! .. . I Here our connection ends,
For I can plainly see, John, you abuse it:
Henceforth count me among your Missing Friends.

Incidentally it may interest you to know that
this Tobacco is being smoked by Sydney’s
business men. It is one of the finest Tobaccos
obtainable anywhere. My Hairdressing Saloon
is the best fitted in Sydney. I cordially invite
you to come in and inspect it while in town.

NOW is a good time
to g'et an EDIvSON
PHONOGRAPH.
DURING the long, cold nights of Winter the Edison Phono-
graph will provide a ready form of entertainment that will
keep things from going flat or becoming monotonous.
It is a harmless, wholesome amusement maker, that always makes
the time pass pleasantly. It plays the latest musical comedy successes
and band marches, renders perfectly the finest orchestral selections
and instrumental solos, tells the funniest stories in the funniest way,
and gives you the songs of present and bygone days. And if you
care to have a little two-step or waltz, the Edison is always ready to
provide the music.
There is an Edison Phonograph to suit everybody’s means, from
the Gem at £2/12/6 to the Amberola at £45. Call to-day on the
nearest Edison dealer and hear the latest records. If you do not
know the whereabouts of a dealer, write us and we will tell you the
name and address of the nearest, and also send latest lists of
machines and records.

GOVERNMENT NOTICES.
fgd
Census of 1911.
ATTENTION is drawn to the fact that under the provisions of the Census and Statistics Act ITOR, and the J-egu-
lations made thereunder, every person who at midnight on the night between Sunday the 2nd and Monday the
3rd April was in any part of the Commonwealth, or was on a voyage between any two Commonwealth ports, is
required to fill in a personal card, and hand it to the Collector or to the nearest postmaster.
In the event of such a card not having been supplied to any such person, it is his or her duty to apply to the
nearest post office for a blank card and copy of instructions, and to fill in the card and hand it to the postmaster.
If such person was the head of a household at the date of the Census, he or she is, in addition, required to obtain
from the post office a householder’s card, and to fill in and hand it, together with his or her personal card, to the
postmaster. In no ca«e must two personal cards be filled in for one person, nor two householders’ cards for one
household. G. H. KNIBBS, Commonwealth Statistician,
“ The Rialto, '' Collins Street, Melbourne.

'ays the Dago has no grip whatever on the fish,
fruit, oyster and catering trade in his village.
I’ll grant the fish and catering, but I’ll go four
that the Dago has more than a slippery hold on
the fish and oysters. There are two firms in
Adelaide that practically control the market for
marine vegetables, one openly doing business
under a Greek name, while the other is a doubtful
quantity. Further, the price of fish—ls. per lb.
for Murray cod and Is. 2d. for sehnapper—is
proof of the existence of a ring ; and a fish-ring in
Australia without a Dago somewhere in its cir-
cumference is too wonderful to contemplate.

Leading' Architects
building homes for their own ownership and occupancy,
are the foremost users of
WUNDERLICH CEILINGS.
This is the strongest possible reason why you, too, should have “ WUNDERLICH CEILINGS ” specified in YOUR contract.
THE Ceiling illustrated above is atypical example of the artistic results produced by using Wunderlich Ceilings.
Incidentally it may be mentioned that it is composed of Patterns No. 920 .and 921, Frieze Pattern No. 935,
and Cornice Pattern No. 1306; but these are only a few of the hundreds of attractive designs we have to offer.
We have appropriate Ceilings and Wallings, Friezes, Cornices and Dadoes for every room of a House, from Drawing-
Room to Pantry, and for all classes of buildings.
WUNDERLICH METAL CEILINGS and WALLINGS are not only highly artistic; they fill every
requirement of Utility, Practicability, Economy and Permanency. They have established new and higher standards
of building comfort, safety and investment value, yet they cost no more than the old-fashioned ceilings. The light,
strong Wunderlich Metal sheets can be quickly and easily put up. Anyone handy with tools can nail them in new
rooms, or fix them over the lath and plaster of old ceilings and walls. Wunderlich Metal withstands strains, shocks
and vibrations that wreck old-fashioned walls and ceilings.
Before you build your house—before you get your plans—before you decide anything—send for and study our
64-page Catalogue, which illustrates hundreds of the Wunderlich Patterns, shows dozens of handsome Wunderlich-
Ceilinged Interiors, and contains full technical yet easily understood information and diagrams explaining the simple
method of fixing and the many advantages of WUN DERLICH M ETAL.
Whether you mean to build early or at some future time, learn about this modern standard of Ceiling
Construction NOW. Write for a copy of the Catalogue. It is free. Address Dept. L.

IN BANANA LAND
The new Queensland Redistribution of
Seats scheme wipes out the Labor strong-
holds of Clermont, Crbydon, Bulloo and
Burke, and creates a number of fresh con-
stituencies, mainly about the capital, by way
of compensation. The new arrangement
will probably benefit the Denham party far
less than it was expected to, as jjolitical feel-
ing in and around Brisbane is steadily wax-
ing in Labor’s favor. In any case, Redistri-
bution was the correct thing, as the gigantic
anomalies existing were a direct negation
of the principle of One Adult One Vote.
Bananaland teetotalers are being whipped
up to vote “No,” on the ground that, if “Yes”
is carrV-d, the liquor traffic may be nation-
alised. These silly people don’t know, ap-
parently, that the traffic can be nationalised
just the same if “No” is carried. In fact,
it is being nationalised by degrees in Wes-
tralia, where various State pubs are in full
swing, and in South Aus., where municipal
pubs have made a start. A “Yes” vote
won’t make the least difference in the power
of nationalising the liquor, or any other
business.
There is a superstition that bore water
is valueless for raising crops in dry country,
owing to the soil becoming impregnated with
alkali after a time; but W. A. McVean, of
Oondoroo station, near Winton, says the
idea is all wrong. The trouble is not with
the water, he says, but with the land, for
he has seen the same water a huge success
on some soils, and a howling failure on
others. lie has produced fine crops of hay,
maize, sorghum and lucerne on deep, loamy
soil irrigated with bore water, but has found
that sandy and clayey soils became hard and
unworkable. While . managing Thurulgoona
station, on the Warrego, he took five crops
of hay off one paddock in successive years,
and in 10 years never had a failure. The
average crop was three tons per acre. He
didn’t trouble about the yield of grain, as
hay was wanted, but he made a test once,
and got a yield of 40 bushels to the acre.
“Bromide,” on the still-piebald North: —
The slimness of the sugar-cocky in dodging the
employment of whites while collecting the “white”
bonus will get him and his industry into trouble
some day. At the Palms and the Pleystowe, in the
Mackav district, the cane is tipped at “loading
stations” alongside the line. It is then loaded on
the railway trucks by colored aliens, nominally en-
gaged by the mills, who are paid Bd. per ton, which
is deducted when the farmer gets his returns. Thus,
the farmer is able to claim the bounty, as he does
not directly employ the aliens, although, as a matter
of fact, they handle his crop. In one sugar district
there is a plantation which belonged to a Civil
servant. To get the bonus he settled his house and
about half an acre of land around it on his wife.
He then fenced this piece off, and when he was
planting he had Kanakas working inside the fence,
preparing the plant-cane and passing it through the
fence to whites, who put it in the ground. His
elastic conscience afterwards allowed him to swear
that no colored alien was employed on his land.
For tricks that are mean the heathen Chinee isn’t in
it with some sugar Cookies. Australia will get
very tired of it all some day; and then bang will go
the bonus, and smash will go the industry.
From a man who ought to know all about
it: —
Ex-Premier Kidston’s long tenure of office has
left many marks of his personal love of economy;
and in this respect the Marine Department is very
conspicuous. Lighthouses and navigational marks
have not been increased in proportion to the raplS
strides that shipping has made; in fact, there is one
light-vessel less, and that one has been shifted from a
locality where it was sorely needed, i.e., Proudfoot
Shoal, where vessels from “the East,” bound for
Thursday Island, are liable to knock, and not be
heard. N. S. Wales, Victoria and South Aus., which
have one clear side where vessels can flounder and
harm no one, are all more liberally served. Im-
poverishment afflicts the whole Department, and,
naturally, the personnel has suffered; and in the
Pilot service the highly qualified man is the excep-
tion, and not the rule. The best interests of
shipping, the keeping of staff and plant in a state of
efficiency, and the development of navigational facili-
ties, to keep pace with the times, have all been
pushed into the background by a most virulent type
of Scotch economy. Plurality of duties and low
pay, is the watchword. The man who can fill the most
positions on the least pay is the man who gets
advancement, whether he has the qualifications or
not. To the lay mind a man filling the position
of Harbor Master, Pilot, Inspector of Fisheries, Light-
houses, Explosives and Shipping, Examiner and Ship-
wright Surveyor should be drawing close up to £lOOO
per annum. As a matter of fact he seldom draws
£3oo—and naturally the qualified man is not
tempted to either come in or stay in.
From an Ancient Mariner: —
The Yongala disaster has advertised the fact that
the Queensland maritime authorities are all behind-
hand. Notoriously one of the most difficult to navi-
gate, the Queensland coast is nevertheless the worst
lighted in Australia. Nor is it equipped with the
up-to-date methods of signalling adopted nearly
everywhere, such as Morse signalling by night.
Further, no attempt is made to warn shipping of a
threatened storm. Had there been any way of noti-
fying Dent Island of the approaching cyclone, as
there ought to have been, the Yongala could have
had ample warning to take necessary precautions.
Even the Chinese have better storm-signal systems
than Queensland owns.
During the Northern cyclone of March 16
a train entered No. 11 tunnel on the Cairns
line, and the passengers were entertained to
find that big boulders commenced to roll
down the mountain side and block their pro-
gress. Retreat was impossible, for huge rocks
had also closed up on the rear of the car-
riages. Night passed amid fear, trembling
and hurricane lamps, and rescue did not
come till next morning. Some day 500 ft. of
a mountain peak will wipe out the work of
Robb for ever and ever. Meantime the Bris-
bane Courier is excogitating a method of
sheeting home disasters of this kind to the
machinations of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment.

When I am gone, send up no supplication;
Pray not for me
Some fresh existence fair, or renovation
Of Life from Sorrow free.
Bow not in grief within some solemn portal,
And fondly beg the skies
That he may rise again, a proud immortal,
Who, softly sleeping, lies.
Pray just that neither joy nor care nor cum-

May break the rest below;
In Nevermore’s Nirvana let me slumber;
And, Gabriel, Do Not Blow!
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, April 10, 1911.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
One of Brisbane’s best-known and most-
caricatured figures in municipal life passed
over on Wednesday—Aid. John Davies.
“Old John,” with his Dundreary whiskers,
his long frock coat, much-oiled hair and an-
gular figure, always reminded me of the
chemist in the fable who was mistaken by
the little boy for the skeleton. All the
same, the departed city father called for
more than a passing word of gratitude, for,
amongst other things, he was instrumental
in obtaining a fine park, now called after
him, for his constituents. He was at one
time chosen by the Tory plebiscite to run
with Willie Stephens for Brisbane South,
but Philp couldn’t stand his whiskers, or
the amount of invisible soap he always used,
or something, and turned him dowrn. As a
chemist Davies administered free pills to
many a hard-up sufferer, and generally acted
the part of guide, philosopher and friend to
the needy.
The marriage of Harold Parker (the Bris-
bane boy who hewed the lovely Ariadne from
her native marble) and Miss Robinson has a
double interest for Queensland, as the bride is
bonnie Jean, daughter of Agent-General
Thomas Robinson. The orange blossoms
bloomed last month.
Pretty Greta Baynes, in a frock of white
satin and Duchess point lace, with the usual
accompaniments, gave her word to be a house-
hold blessing to Mr. Arthur L. MacDonald,
of Yaamba station, on Wednesday. The
bridegroom is a son of the P. F. MacDonald
who .■ sold “CuHm-la-ringo” to the ill-fated
Wills, just before that unfortunate and
almost the whole of his party were killed by
the blacks. The bride’s father, Harry
Baynes, is one of Brisbane’s most popular
sports, and a lover of a good thing between
the shafts.
How one’s past does intrude itself, to be
sure. Many things have been said of Pre-
mier Denham, but it was left to the Daily
Mail (London) to announce that he “was
born at Langport, Somerset, and served his
apprenticeship with a local drapery firm dur-
ing the years 1872-77.”
A lady in the woolly West, in a burst of
generosity, has forwarded a letter to the Gen-
eral Hospital Committee, offering to donate
a certain proportion of the rental of a shop
in Allora to the funds of the institution, if
the committee will send along a tenant. Un-
fortunately, the idea of running a land and
estate agency has not yet struck the com-
mittee with any force. Besides, very few
people want to go to Allora.
There is yet another engagement to chronicle,
and it has to do with pretty Miss Fitzgerald
and Mr. Nigel Shand, of Toowong.
Miss Fanny Donkin will marry, in Syd-
ney, Mr. Cadell, of Deepwater, on the day
after this reaches you. The Cadells of
Deepwater are some of the best known and
liked of the highlands cattle and sheep men,
and Miss Fanny, whose father once drove
the smartest four-in-hand hereabouts, has
friends by the streetful.
Great sympathy is being expressed with
Mrs. Townley and her daughters at the un-
timely death of a son of the house, in the
Malay Straits. His father, Capt. Townley,
died last year, while the two girls were
visiting the brother.
Another well-known about-town whose
condition is causing his family some uneasi-
ness is John Forrest, until recently the gen-
eral manager of Moreheads, Ltd., and one of
Queensland’s biggest cattle men. Dengue
on top of other troubles has kept him down.
Amongst the names on the big passenger
list of the Orient liner Orvieto, which sailed
on Wednesday, was Mrs. Bocock, well known
in literary and charitable circles, and Mrs.
Cecil Palmer and hubby. The scribe lady
should get a good look in at the Coronation
shivoo, if letters from the Macgregor clan
cut any ice.
Ferman MacKinnon, who has for some
half-dozen years put his shoulder to the pen
for the local Telegraph, takes the editorial
chair of the Darling Downs Gazette, Too-
woomba, at Easter time. MacKinnon is a
prophet of practical Socialism, in addition
to his other virtues.
The Home Sec., with a party, has been
touring the Burnett district, and, during the
tour, called in at the ancient and interesting
town of Mt. Percy, where your Mario had
an opportunity of seeing copper smelting.
The sight of the hissing trays of molten
metal and the sluggish stream of slag pour-
ing from the furnaces like the overflow from
Tophet, produced a 6 x 4 thrill. If the
place which begins with a capital H is any-
thing like those smelting works, I’m going to
be good in future. The old mine, which
was going in the early ’7o’s, is now the deep-
est for copper in Queensland, the ore com-
ing from 1100 ft. down; soon it will be
grubbed for a hundred feet deeper. Even
with the metal at the present low price, the
works run at a small profit, thus bearing out
the faith of late mining-man Bennett, who,
in spite of public and official discredit, clung,
limpet-like, to his belief in the property.
A Northerner writes me:—
Alma Moodie, the Queensland child-violinist, is
getting good help in the Big Fog. The wife of
good Australian Coghlan (N.S.W. Agent-General) is
interesting herself in the youngster, and, as hints
have been thrown out that Royalty is interested,
Society is flitting to her aid. The child, even as
a three-year-old babbler, had a wonderful ear. She
could tell the notes composing any chord (with or
without accidentals) struck on any octave of the
piano. Her mother was a music-teacher —I learnt
from her —and 1 often saw the child at these re-
markable pranks. She learnt her violin from
Hage, of Rockhampton, who was recently asked to
make one of Lemmone’s eight violins for Melba’s
Australian tour. (He said “No,” by the way.)
Alma must be nearing 13 now.
Yours affectionately,
MARDG.
Premier Denliam, anxious to catch the
Temperance vote at the Enoggera election,
forecasted the introduction of a Licensing
Act Amending Bill at the commencement of
next session. The Alliance News (Rec-
habite) thanks him thusly :
Of course we must riot forget this promise was
made at an election, and our past experience has
taught us to be careful how far we trust expressions
of this kind.
Poor Denham! Bung doesn’t like him, and
the Wowsers mistrust him!
The ancient, insanitary custom of “kissin’
the book,” by way of taking the oath, has
been meeting with much public disapproval
in Queensland lately. In the Jondaryan
murder trial a doctor said it was an unclean
and disease-spreading practice, and he wasn’t
going to take any risks, when the risks were
supremely unnecessary. There was the
usual argument, which was bitten off by the
Judge telling him that he must kiss some
800k —either the Court’s cancer-carrier or
one of his own. Whereupon the medical man
did what most men do under the circum-
stances, and the farce was ended.

When Weaning Baby
The Best Food to give is
The ‘Allenburys’ Milk Food No. 1.
On the addition of water as directed, it forms an accurately estimated
humanised milk, and may be given alternately with the natural food
without fear of upsetting the child or causing digestive disturbance.
Weaning can therefore proceed gradually with comfort both to mother
and child. Farinaceous foods should not be given at this time.

A GREAT OFFER
To all Lovers of Dickens.
No lover of books, no one who enjoys a
good story, with its blended elements of re-
freshing laughter, tender feeling, and wise
and humorous views of life —above all, no
family circle-bought to be without an edition
of the novels of Charles Dickens.
We have no hesitation in affirming that in
the London Edition of the Works of Dickens,
in thirty volumes, we are offering to the pub-
lic the most attractive and the most useful
edition yet offered to the public of all the
editions of Dickens that are continually be-
ing put on the market.
THE LONDON EDITION OF DICKENS
includes a splendid Life of Charles Dickens,
by the late F. G. Kitton. Each novel is pre-
fixed by a short illustrated introduction, giv-
ing the date and circumstances, in which it
was written, and interesting particulars about
the actual place in which the scene of the
novel is laid. And the most famous and real
of Dickens’s characters are traced back to
their original prototypes; this is a very in-
teresting and valuable feature.
CRUIKSHANK’S ORIGINAL
ILLUSTRATIONS.
No edition of Dickens’s works is complete
without the famous original illustrations by
“Phiz,” Cruikshank and Leech, Seymour and
Cattermole; for Dickens himself approved
their work as the best embodiment in picture
form of his own idea. These illustrations
have hitherto appeared in black and white
only, except in the case of one or two novels
issued at very high prices. But in this fine
London Edition, out of a total of 336 plates,
104 are beautifully colored, and this for the
first time is an edition at a popular price.
Besides these splendid plates, there are, in
the specially-written introductions to the
nevels, interesting illustrations of famous
places in Diekensland. These have been
specially drawn.
A FREE BOOKLET.
The Publishers have compiled a hand-
somely illustrated prospectus of “The LON-
DON DICKENS,” which will be sent POST
free to all who use this form. It tells all
about this fine edition, the division of the
volumes, etc., and gives specimens of the il-
lustrations. It also tells of their offer to
deliver the edition, carriage paid, for a first
payment of 55., the balance being paid by
small monthly payments.
To Mr. T. G. Lothian ,
100 Flinders Street, Melbourne.
Please send me, free of charge, and without
anti obligation , fullest information about
“The London Dickens,” with particulars of
your plan of monthly payments.

A CIGAR is the BEST
SMOKE OF ALL!
But why can’t you get a
Good Cigar in the Country?
A LL over Australasia the only places you can
r\ buy a really high-class Cigar is in the big
cities. In the country districts a good Cigar
cannot be had; because it’s only at the pubs that
you can buy Cigars at all in the out-back districts.
The publican knows that selling liquor pays him
better. He reckons that his customers only call
for a Cigar when they ve got a few drinks in and
want to dodge getting ‘‘fu’ the noo." Any old
Cigar does for that.
So he buys a few hundred at a time from
some back-yarder"-real “Flor de Cabbage"
with big gold pictures all over the box and
mighty pretty bands round them—made from the
waste leaf and the cheapest growths, but called
by some high-fain tin’ name. (The making of these
Cigars is another story-I’ll tell you about it
another time.)
sfďghf
Thestorekeeperor tobac-
conist in country towns does
not sell good Cigars either.
If he does, he has to add to
the selling price of the Cigar,
the maker’s profit, the profit
of the warehouseman he
buys from, the profit of the
traveller who calls and sells
them to him, and his own
profit.
So that a good Cigar
that sells in the city at 6d.
he’d have to charge gd. for,
and not grow fat on it then,
because the number he would
sell would be small; and
good Cigars have to be kept
in a uniform temperature,
free from exposure to the
air, or else they’ll go off.
Those are just some of
the reasons why you can’t
get a good Cigar in the
country parts of Australia,
and also why so very few
Cigars are at present smoked
in the country.
Buy a 100-box of my
DIADEMAS,” smoke 5 or
6 of them, and, if they’re
not as good as any 6d.
Cigar you’ve ever smoked,
you needn’t pay a penny.
That’s the way I’m in-
troducing my Cigars into
Australia. I know Cigar-
making from A to Z. I know
these DIADEMAS Cigars of
mine are just the coolest,
smoothest and most luxu-
nous smoke any man could wish for. Cigar-
smokers of a lifetime say so; and the more you
know about a good Cigar the better you’ll like
them.
My DIADEMAS are made from the very
finest, mild, rich, mellow, Java leaf, the filling or
inside heart of the Cigar being all straight long
Brazilian. The Cigars are hand made by skilled
workers, and every box has to pass me before it
goes out to a customer; and is guaranteed to
burn free and draw easily. The Cigar is 4 inches
long, and the picture at the side is a copy of it,
exact in size and shape.
Now, this DIADEMAS Cigar is as good as
any 6d, Cigar, sold in the cities by high-class
tobacconists, as I sell it direct to the customer—
saving the cost of wholesalers’, salesmen’s, and
retailers’ profit. I only charge you 22/6 the box
of 100 DIADEMAS, postage paid right to your
address.
Send 22/6 to-day, and get the box of 100
DIADEMAS by return post. In ordering, say
whether you like the mild, medium, or strong
grade. Please add exchange to country and
interstate cheques.

WHAT IS CATARRH ?
Catarrh is inflammation of the lining
membrane of the nose and adjoining
passages. If this inflammation is not ar-
rested it invades the passages which lead
from the nose to the head, ears, throat and
lungs. It injures the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense of taste and smell, ren-
ders the breath offensive, breaks down
the affected tissues, and consumes the
nasal cartilages. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and stomach, causes
dyspepsia, also consumption. Do you
v~nt relief and cure? If so, try our
great remedy.

Miss Ivy
Schilling
Swears
by...
REXONA.
ONE of the most sensational star items ever seen on an
Australian Stage is the acrobatic “ Danse du Vaurien, ’
given by Miss Ivy Schilling and that noted artiste and
dancer, Mr. Fred Leslie, in the record-breaking Musical Comedy,
“Our Miss Gibbs,’’ sLill playing to enormous business in its
seventh month at the Theatre Royal.
While touring with the “Jack and Jill” Pantomime, Miss
Schilling won the Maskelyne and Devant Prize for Beauty at
Christchurch, N.Z.—a valuable gold watch and chain, which she
wears daily.
Miss Ivy Schilling is the winner of West’s Pictures Surf
Sirens’ Competition, in which close on 100,000 votes were •
recorded. Her figure is a perfect model of athletic symmetry
and grace. To preserve its litheness, its vigor and its strength,
she uses REXONA.
This is what the admired acrobatic actress says :

invaluable as a protection against sunburn and freckles. It is a
wonderful healer, and I always keep a tin of it handy.
Yours sincerely,
(Sgd. ) IVY SCHILLING.

Dark Stars.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SINGLE suns that, slowly burning, m their
orbits swing and press;
Planet-souls and spirits turning own
paths of nothingness !
Blackened lives, remembered only by the aze 0
vanished light—
These are sweeping, stark and lonely, throug 1 ie
Everlasting Night! ..
These are drifting where no laughter in the a-S
of Silence rings;
Where the dead shall drift hereafter with t leir
sirens, priests and kings !
Suns long set—their day all over ; as the clouds
in terraced bars
Round the far worlds lift and hover, swing the
dark and perished stars !
Stormy sunsets, lurid-glaring—who remembers .
Who regrets ?
Vanished leaders —these are faring down the
Nights’ blown parapets;
Suns whose splendor paroxysmal lit the way of
creeping Man,
Fallen down to depths abysmal from the Army s
shining van !
Cold and heavy lie the vapors, choking out the
fire of life ;
Quenched stars and flameless tapers that were lit
in days of strife !
Dim and red, in shadows sweeping—shining once
like peerless Mars ;
Where the suns are vigil-keeping troop the dark
and nameless stars!
Stars that hold their proud dominion, beacon-souls
that shine and guide ;
Lo, with these on silent pinion earth’s long-
vanished leaders ride !
Where the ages loom and darken Christs and
Buddhas nameless are;
None may heed and none may hearken —star rides
on with comrade star !
Not alone !—with dark star-shadows, Nazarenes
whose day is done ;
Signal-souls whose El Dorados were in dreams
ecstatic spun !
Side by side, the Rebels holy ride upon Olympic
'cars,
Where the suns are sinking slowly, fade the dark,
ouce-lustrous stars !
Souls to-day are world-ward landing whilst their
sands of glory run ;
You and I, half-understanding, at the death-bed
of a sun;
Out of Space and Time appearing—out of dark-
ness into light,
Whilst the dying stars go veering down the high-
ways of the Night!
You and I—of star-dust fashioned, shaped on
earth, we think and see,
Whilst the suns new-dead, unpassioned yield their
shining panoply !
Perished globes—l see them dying, going down
like sinking spars;
Where the mist-wrapt worlds are flying drift to
dark, unanchored stars!
Sphere-like souls, their light departed, ’thwart
the seas of Space disperse;
Stars unknown, unnamed, uncharted, rolling
through the universe;
Retinues of souls slow-marching o’er the ages
stretching wide;
Where the pallid moons are arching souls of
vanished leaders ride !
Planets cold, beyond our vision, wandering light-
less and forlorn,
Till the hour of soul-collision, when the bright,
new stars are born !
Souls that sweep on through the darkness, waiting
for new avatars,
Where the dead worlds roll in starkuess lie the
one-time splendid stars !
VICTORIA.
GRANT HERVEY.
Wilson, the Crocodile and the
Cabman.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rri HERE is a certain garden in a Mel-
bourne suburb which contains a
stuffed crocodile. It is an unusual
sort of ornament, and was placed there
many years ago by an ex-squatter from
Queensland. He did not attach the thing
very firmly to its stand, and the gales of
years have left it supported only by the
midship section. The ugly head, with its
half-open jaws, and the big tail hang loosely
above the ground; and when the wind blows
they wag slowly from side to side, giving
the thing a horribly life-like look, especially
if the light isn’t very good. Short-sighted
people have fled from it even at high noon.
**. * *
It was 2 o’clock of a misty moonlight
morning when the cab pulled up under the
pine trees that fringe the Garden of the
Crocodile.
“’Ere you are,” growled the cabman, open-
ing the window at the back of his seat, and
addressing the man in crumpled evening--
dress who lay dozing in the corner.
“Don’t sound like it,” muttered the fare
without opening his eyes. “Y’ didn’t drive
over any gravel. Don’t sound like it a
bit!”
“Well, it looks like it,” retorted the cab-
man fiercely. “It’s th’ place you de-scribed
an’ I’ve drove yer to it, an’ now I want you
t’ get out and give me me fare!”
The passenger yawned immensely, and
without any show of agitation, remarked,
“I bleeve I’ve met you before somewhere.”
“Never mind about that now!”
“Voice sounds fam-famil’r,” muttered the
man in the dress-suit. “Swear I’ve met you
before somewhere. What’s color of yer
hair —red?”
“Look ’ere, you,” said the cabman wildly,
“you wake up an’ shut up an’ pay! I
won’t take that sorter thing from anyone,
an’ I’m not goin’ f drive yer any more t’
night! Gome on now!
The fare’s sleepy eyes opened, and jested
for a moment on the cabman s flushed face
\yj\ ffringe of rod tuiir. otro&din ry .
he mlSbS 5 “Same man! Always wants
’ "Welh d ain’t it natclier'l?” shouted the
driver, indignantly. “If anyone owed you
five shillins’, wouldn’t you wanter to be
Pa -Ts five shillin’s ’mount of your fare?”
‘‘Yes it is ! ,J
“Do you always charge same ’mount from
Club?” ,
“Yes —an’ you orter know it!
The fare held out his right hand. Well,
give us ten shillin’s change and shurrup
’bout it!” ,
The cabman turned and spat over the
wheel on to the road. “Tork sense!” he
sneered. “Yer never gave me no suvrin, an
if yer sez yer did, well, then I sez that ye’re
—that ye’re wrong !”
The man inside sat up, and, leaning for-
ward, leered in the enraged driver’s face.
“Don’ you remember drivin’ me once be-
fore?” he inquired.
The red-haired cabman looked hard at his
customer, and started. “Now I come t' look
at yer, I do. An’ a rotten bad time yer give
me —kep’ me messin’ about arf’ th’ blanky
night.”
•‘Qui’ ri’,” said Wilson, triumphantly.
“Yer tried t’ give me in charge, an’ charged
me ten shillin’s, an’ I gave you las’ sov’rin
I had. Give’s ten shillin’s change an’ shur-
rup !”
“Blimey!” yelled the cabman, aghast, as
soon as the full import of the words had
soaked into his understanding. “Lor’ blimey,
you’re a bosker, you are! Yer give a man
a few bob over and come at ’im for it as
change ’bout two year afterwards. W’y
don’t yer tork sense?”
“Shurrup, and give me ten shillin’s
change,” growled Wilson, aggressively, from
the interior of the cab.
“You don’t get no change outer me,” said
the cabman desperately, speaking through
the trap-door.“ That sorter thing won’t ’old
in law, you see.”
Replied Wilson: “I don’t wanter see yer
father-in-law! I want ten shillin’s change!”
“I didn’t say nothin’ about me father-in-
law !”
“Well, f’r th’ Lord’s sake, don’t! I don’
want yer t’ drag yer relations inter a pri-
vate matter of this kind. There’s no neces-
sity t’ drag old gentleman inter it at all.
Daresay he’s got troubles enough of his own,
poor old josser.”
“Oh ! ’old on! I didn’t say nothin’ ”
“’Scuse me one minute! There’s one
thing I partic’ly dislike ’bout cabmen and
washerwomen —they always wanter drag
their relations into argument, and tell yer
how many children they’ve got t’ s’port.
That’s not satisfact’ry way doin' business
—it isn’t business-like !”
“Oh, ’old on a minit! I didn’t say nothin’
about me father-m-law —I ain’t got one!
Wot I said was that that there gag o’ yours
wouldn’t -’old-in-law! It’s no good tryin’ t’
put me orf. I want me munney!”
A scornful laugh was the only reply.
“An’ what’s more, I’m goin’ t’ yet it!”
“Qui’ ri’!”
“It’s no use you tryin’ any funny bizness
on me! I know my rights, and’ I’ll stick to
’em!”
“Qui’ ri’, my boy !”
“You don’ get me drivin’ yer round all
th’ blanky nigiit f’r nothin’! I’ve been at
th’ game too long !”
“Bet you haven’t been at it as long as yer
rotten old horse!”
The sally maddened the driver. ‘lts a
good enough horse f’r th’ likes o’ you!” he
yelled. “If yer wanted t’ get ’ome quick,
w’y didn’t yer tell yer bloomin’ shover t’
bring yer bloomin’ moter for yer?”
“’Scuse me one minute,” said Wilson with
dignity. “I wasn’t complainin’ ’bout the speed
of th’ thing; I was referrin’ t’ th’ scrap-
heap’s age. You know d —n well that it
ought t’ be in th’ Benevolent ’Sylum.”
“Never mind where it oughter be ! It’s
finished with draggin’ you roun’ orl th’
bloomin’ night f’r nothin!”
“Wrong again, me boy ! It isn’t draggin
me roun’ f’r nothin, I paid for this funeral
two years ago!”
“Well, this ’ere’s th’ cemet’ry, then,”
snapped the cabman. “You get an’
bury yerself an’ lemme get ’ome!”
“Hoi’ on!” said the fare hurriedly. “You
take me up th’ drive. I’m not goin’ t’
walk!”
“I’ll get somethin’ extrv outer ’im f r this
w’en ’e’s sober,” muttered the cabman as he
turned his horse and steered the conveyance
through the open wide gates.
As they crossed the pathway, Wilson
stirred in the recesses of the vehicle, and said
loudly: “They’ve been an’ put up new gates
since tea! D —d ’stravagance !”
Next instant there was a loud shout of
horror, and Wilson, who was a heavy man,
shot head-foremost out of the cab, dragged
the driver from his seat, and ran him with
resistless strength towards the border oi
pine trees. “Quick, f’r God’s sake. he
panted as they reached the biggest. “Climb
like blazes! Make room f’r me!” He
seized the protesting cabman’s _ leg and
hoisted him up on to the lowest limb. “Up
with yer cabby! Quick —climb!” Then,
with astounding agility, he swung himself
up after the man he had saved, and started
to prod and push him skyward through a
splintering maze of branches. “Up, ole
chap! Up higher!” he kept hissing. , The
terrified cabman’s whines of “What tli’ ’ell’s
th’ matter?” and “’Oo th’ devil’s chasin us?”
went totally unheeded in the terror and con-
fusion. Their frenzied progress skyward
ended only when they had reached the tree-
top—or within a few feet of it. The sway-
ing of the mast-like trunk was very notice-
able at that height. The garden and the
dwai’fed stationary cab, seen through the
branches, seemed fearfully remote —the
clouds and moon absurdly near. The wind
moaned and bent the tree, and Wilson re-
marked breathlessly : “By George ! narrow’st
escape I ever had !”
“Was it burglars?” whispered the cab-
man, with his arms and legs tightly wound
round the limb on which he sat.
“Burglars! No! Didn’t yer see th’alli-
gator?”
The cabman almost lost his hold. “’E’s
got the ’orrors!” he whined miserably. “’E’s
got the ’orrors, an’ now I’m up a green tree
with a blue loonertick!”

MBS. GBOSVENOB,
cured of Itching Eczema by Zam-Buk
All Over Chest and Back-
Irritation Was Unbearable.
STRIKING- evidence of the won-
derful powers of that great an-
tiseptic healer, Zam-Buk, in
dispelling disease and growing
sound, new, healthy skin, comes from
Mrs. C. Grosvenor, a resident of 24
Junction Road, Summer Hill, Sydney,
who says
“ Some eighteen months ago I had a
severe attack of eczema. This terrible
disease spread until my chest and
back were covered. It assumed a very
red, inflamed appearance, and the
burning itchiness nearly drove me
mad. My flesh was just like raw
meat. I could neither sleep nor rest
day or night. I was one mass of little
red blisters, so close together that the
point of a pin could not be placed
between them. Neither hospital treat-
ment nor doctor’s medicine gave me
any permanent relief from this ter-
rible scourge, and I became run-down
and weak. I felt like tearing the
affected parts off my body to give
some ease.
“ A lady friend of mine told me
Zam-Buk would cure me. I soon pur-
chased a supply, and before I had

SOOTHES
and
THE
QUESTION of the DAY.
The question of to-day,
of to-morrow and of
every succeeding day is
HAVE YOU USED PEARS’ SOAP ?
If you have not, you have not
done your duty by your skin and
complexion. If, on the other hand
—that is, on both hands, and on the
face, and on the skin generally- you
HAVE used PEARS, you can feel
happy, for you will have done the
best that possibly can be done tor
the skin’s health and beauty. There
can be no question about that.
PEARS has been making beautiful
complexions for nearly 120 years.
PEARS
Matchless for the Complexion.
( ou shut up!” hissed Wilson, angrily.
Open yer eyes and look at it waggin’ its
tail at yer rotten old horse! It’ll start t’
eat it in a minute, an’ serve th’ brute right!
Never seen such a rotten horse in me life!”
The cabman, by dint of craning his neck,
at last managed to get a good view of the
stuffed alligator. It looked horribly alive
in the misty moonlight as it ogled the droop-
ing horse in the shafts of the cab. Still the
wretched man was loath to believe his eyes,
and had sufficient courage left to state the
fact. “I don’t b’leeve it’s a real alleyga-
tor,” he faltered.
“Well, go down and kick it in th’ teeth,”
sneered the rescuer. “Go on, climb down!”
The cabman made no move.
“If it isn’t a real alligator, what th’
devil do yer think it is—a dragon out of a
Chow laundry ?”
“’Ow could sich a thing git ’ere?” de-
manded the suspended cabman, with sudden,
sheep-like ferocity.
“Don’ be fool! Aren’t things always
gettin loose from museums an’ circuses an’
quariums ? Wliat ’bout those lions that
got outer th’ circus the other day in Noo
South W ales ? Only damnfool like yourself
wants t’ go an’ pinch th’ lionelephantigator
to see if it’s alive. Man with presence of
mind like meself gets out of way quick.
You would be inside that d—d old wliat-
d ye-call-um now if I hadn’t pulled you up
here. You oughter be thankful, ole chap,
that you’re alive!”
‘lll be thankful w’en I know f’r certain
that th’ d—n thing ain’t stuffed !”
“Well, my boy, you sit tight where you
are, an watch it eat your rotten ole horse.
By th way it’s wrigglin’ in front of him, I
guess it’s tryin’ t’ make up its mind which
end of him it’ll eat first!”
“Any’ow, ’’retorted the cabman, “if that
there orse is et, you’ll ’ave t’ pay fur it.
You made me drive inter th’ garden.”
“Now, look here,” said Wilson, standing
precariously on a swaying branch, and tap-
ping the cabman on the knee: “I want you
to distinc’ly understan’ that I refuse abs’-
lootely t’ pay f’r anythin’ at all! If th’
what-d ye-call-um eats th’ horse or th’ cab
or both of ’em, I’m not goin’ t’ pay you one
penny! Remember that!”
“Orright, then. We’ll see what th’lor’ll
do about it!”
“No, m’ boy ! We’ll wait t’ see what th’
d—d old allidile does first!”
‘ You’re tryin’ t’ say alleygator, ain’t
you?”
“Oh, no —nothin’ of th’ kind ! I meant
croclcagator! ”
“Try agen!” jeered the cabman.
Certn’ly, my boy! Anythin’ t’ 'blige
yer! How does allicrock suit yer? Are
yer satisfied now, ole chap?”
“I will be wen I get me property back
an lose you! Ullo! There’s a pleece-
man now. I’m goin ’ down!” He made a
move as though to slip off his perch; but
Wilson, with a large fatherly hand, re-
strained him, and peered down through the
branches at the policeman standing at the
gate. ‘ LOOK OUT!” he yelled lustily.
"Be careful of the crocodile!”
The constable, in his endeavor to locate
the spot whence the warning came, rotated
three times on his axis. He appeared to be
unduly indignant; probably he took the
warning for a mere musical comedy frivo-
lity.
“Run !” howled Wilson. “Don’ be a fool!
RUN! TH’ CROCODILE’LL CATCH
“Come down out av thot!” shouted the
constable, approaching the tree. "Stop yer
nonsense an’ come down!”
“Climb th’ tree!” advised Wilson, in a
frenzy of excitement.
The constable took it for a defiance. “I
will, me boy, if you don’t come down whin
I tell you to!”
“’E’s mad!” wailed the cabman, making
futile efforts to escape. “’E won’t let me
come down!”
“How many of yez is up there?” de-
manded the policeman, endeavoring to peer
up through the branches.
“’E’s drunk,” added the cabman. “’E’s
drunk, like ’e alwiz is!”
“An’ phat th’ devil are you! ”
“I’m th’ cabman !”
“He’s a rotten cabman,” interjected Wil-
son. “I’m sorry I saved his life!”
“Oh, I’m a rotten cabman.”
“Yes, my boy, you are —you’re a real
rotten cabman!”
“Hould on there!” roared the constable.
“I’m not satisfied in me inoind about this
at all! I don’t like th’ look av it!”
“Why, you d —d fool, that jus’ why we
got up !”
“SHUT UP, YOU !”
“It’s no use!” screamed the cabman.
“You carn’t get ’im t’ tork sense —’e’s
drunk !”
“It’s my furrm o-pinyin that ye are
both drunk!”
“Thas qui’ ri,” cordially assented Wilson.
“Th’ cabman is drunker than I am, though !
How drunk d’ye reckon you are?”
There was a pause. Then, in a voice of
cold determination, came the answer: “Not
too drunk t’ go up after you if ye don’t
come down right away. Come now, th’ two
av yez, an’ give over talkin’ nonsinse. It’ll
save bother.”
Without more ado they descended —
slowly and with a great snapping of twigs
and much snappish argument. At last, the
long legs of Wilson emerged from the woody
maze and felt for the earth. About liis
shoulders played the busted boots of the cab-
man on the same quest. The policeman
reached up immense arms and assisted them
both tenderly to the ground. They were both
dishevelled and dusty, and Wilson’s top-
hat was crushed over his eyes. It was some
time before the policeman recognised his
captive. When at last he did so, he saluted
smartly with a broad smile: “Mr. Wilson,
sorr ! I didn’t know ye !”
Wilson shook him warmly by the hand.
“Don’t mention it, old feller! Mistake’s
mutual, I ’sure you! HULLO! What’s
old Tom Charlton doin’ here this time of
night?”
The policeman and the dusty cabman
turned round and beheld a large, half-
dressed man with a stick in one hand and a
stable lantern in the other, hurrying to-
wards them.
“Hullo, Tom, you old rotter, shouted
Wilson at the approaching householder.
“Good Lord! it’s Wilson!” gasped the
householder. “What the blazes brought
you here?”
“That rotten old cab, my boy. I fell
’sleep an’ th’ driver mixed up directions
like a fool and drove me in by mistake, I
think.”
“I didn’t make no mistake, at all!”
“Oh! do shut up, ole man . . . W T hen I
got in I saw your d—d old tame alligator
an’ climbed th’ tree, shovin’ this cabman be-
fore me. I don’t know why I saved him;
suppose I must have wanted him t’ drive
me home. It was d —d plucky of me!”
“It was d—d silly of yer!”
“Look here, my frien’! If you don’t shut
up, I’ll pay you only strict legal fare —
whatever it is—an’ you’ll have t’ go ’way
and die of a broken heart. .. . Will you
shut up?”
“Blimey, you think you can say anythin’
to a man, you do!”
“That’ll do, now — that'll do!”
“Anyone ’ud think you was th’ Tgh
Commission’r th’ way you go on!”
“Quit it!” snapped the constable, de-
cisively. “Can’t ye see that Mr. Wilson is
only jokin’ wid you? ’Tis his way.”
The cabman, grumbling in his throat, sub-
sided.
“When did you leave the club, Billy?”
laughed the proprietor of the alligator.
Wilson shoved his belltopper to the back
of his head and scratched his eye. “Blowed
if I know, ole man; but it seems years since
I had that last drink!”
“Well, it’s time we all had another,” said
Chai-lton. “Hold on a minute, all of you—
I’ll bring it out to the garden.” With the
swinging stable lantern he disappeared into
the house, and returned in a minute with a
bottle and siphon. From the pockets of
his dressing-gown he deftly extracted glasses
and handed them round. Then they gather-
ed round the cab, and the chuckle of poured
whisky and the soothing hiss of the siphon
made a whole Peace Conference in itself.
It was the policeman who finally broke
up the gathering, just as day was breaking,
by saying that he had to meet the sergeant
at the corner. Then Wilson arose from the
alligator’s back, and taking his top-hat from
over the brute’s left eye. where it had been
roosting at a rakish angle, offered the officer
a lift.
Charlton, his lantern still burning
bravely, waved the farewell as they drove
out the gates; and the whole three of them
—Wilson, the cabman and the constable—
waved back and cheered. Of the departing
guests, only the horse appeared to be de-
pressed. But then, it had not shared in

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
riIHE haze along the hillsides, the sparkle on
I ’ the Bay
-**- Marconi forth the message of Spring’s ad-
vance to-day.
Now all the fields are blazoned with epaulettes of
gold ;
Now all the trees their standards of Victory
uphold.
In gallant cohorts riding, white gloves upon their
hands,
The soldier seas are marshalled along Port Phil-
lip’s sands.
So dream we here together of all sweet things
that be.
By drowsy Mordialloc, a-facing to the sea.
To-day no red-robed Angel of Discontent shall
mar
Our peace with drums of discord or clash of social
war ;
To-day this land Aegean of roses, love and wine.
In all its lotus splendor is wholly yours and mine,
While Commerce, coarsely strident, plays out her
vulgar part,
Romance shall be our handmaid, with Poesy and
Art.
We left the mart behind us, in Flinders-street,
that we
Might find at Mordialloc a temple by the sea.
Your hair hath meshed the sunbeams ; your voice
is low and sweet
(French heels enhance, ’tis certain, the play of
pretty feet).
This Southern land that gave you your roses and
your pearl
Is maiden yet to conquest; like you—a careless
girl.
These meadows all around us, to me they but en-
fold
Your daintiness—a ruby, set in Australian gold,
The spirit of my own land, vivacious, young and
free,
To-day at Mordialloc, expression finds in thee.
So falls your voice in rhythm ; so beats my heart
in tune ;
While by a velvet stairway creeps down the After-
noon.
Till lo ! at Evening’s doorway she standeth soft
and shy
To wave in sunset blushes duenna Day good-
bye. . . .
Now creeps the slow sail shoreward across the
darkening Bay;
Now close in silent thousands, the blossoms of the
Day ;
The bare- hath left the foreland, the light hath
left the sea ;
White stars, by Mordialloc, burn over you and
me.
l’envoi.
But when the wheels of Action once more around
me whirl,
I’ll think of Mordialloc, a sunset and a girl ;
And where upon his service—the red-robed Angel
—I
Go forth his will proclaiming, all days, until I
die,
Though Duties stern command me, though proud
ambitions call
The waves by Mordialloc shall sing beyond them
all !
And, golden as thy tresses, with inward sight I’ll
see
The sun on Mordialloc go down—in memory.

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indjgestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take ;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use ; their beneficial effects are eV
by the disappearance of headache—a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
- MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite
independent of Aperient Medicines.
