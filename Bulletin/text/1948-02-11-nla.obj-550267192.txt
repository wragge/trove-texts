“SUCCESS TO THE HAWTHORN,” SAY GUESTS OF STATELY CAWDOR CASTLE
COME miles portli-east of Inverness in the neighbouring shire
of Nairn, stands one of Scotland’s best-known castles: the
castle of Cawdor, a few miles to. the west of which is Culloden
Moore, or Drummossie, scene of the last battle on Scottish soil.
Cawdor Castle is not a ruin: its drawbridge is still there, the
weather-beaten towers still defy time and the changing seasons,
and indoors there are magnificent tapestries and furniture that
craftsmen built long years ago. Macbeth, of course, was Thane
of Cawdor, and they may still show you the room in Cawdor
Castle where—according to Shakespeare—Duncan was slain. The
Macbeth’s brother was forefather of the Calders, to whom Cawdor
Castle once belonged, and the tale of its building is interesting.
When seeking a site for his stronghold an Calder was led,
in a dream, to a hawthorn-tree about which the castle was duly
built. This tree still grows within the castle, and for ages it has
been the custom for the castle guests to assemble round the tree
and drink “Success to the Hawthorn.” There is a story that in
early days the Campbells of Innerliver kidnapped a young Calder
heiress named Muriella from the castle grounds who later married
Sir John Campbell, third son of the second Earl of Argyll,
and their descendents are in the castle of Cawdor to this
day.

HOWARD HINTON.
I find it difficult to write about my
ojd friend Howard Hinton, because there
were no complexities in his personality,
no dramatic highlights in his life, and
that life was devoted to a single purpose
from his earliest years to the last breath
he drew on earth. That purpose was
the encouragement and preservation of
the best art of his generation in this
country, and no service to a country’s
destiny can go higher.
When I add that he was the kindest,
most generous - minded and most
courteous of men, I have written his
biography. There was not a spark of
pettiness or malice in his whole make-
up, and in that respect he was unique.
I certainly never met another man like
him for that peculiar nobility of soul
which ignores the eternal warfare of
creeds, iconoclasrqs and personalities, and
goes quietly and intently about its own
affairs, treading an unruffled course
through the fanatical furies of the
modern world of aesthetics.
There were no shades or complexities
or reservations in his character. It was a
complete giving of his whole being to an
inspired mission. I must call it that.
A country has no moral existence with-
out a central core of culture, and without
such men as Howard ITmton it can have
no culture.
Perception is the other half of crea-
tion. Art cannot be created in a vacuum.
Nor can the art of a generation affirm
its own values, however loud it may
shout to try to carry conviction. That
affirmation can come only from the con-
noisseur who ignores studio slogans and
who affirms values from a profound
knowledge of the whole tradition of art.
And no one had a more complete and
annotated knowledge of that tradition
than Hinton. His memory was astound-
ing. You could not mention any picture
by an accredited painter of any period
of which he could not give you its
motif, a precise description of its color-
scheme, its size, and what gallery it hung
in. This faculty was the more amazing
as he was extremely myopic, and usually
went over a picture with his nose a few
inches from its surface.
But, of course, a special faculty of
mind can dominate a misfunctioning of
the senses. And Hinton had trained his
mind from his earliest years. He told
me once that when he was a lad of 12
his father, who must have been a re-
markable man, said to Howard and his
young brother, “I am going to let you
boys decide where you want to go for
a holiday this year. I’ll give you what
money you require, but you must go by
yourselves and calculate your own ex-
penses.” The lads decided for St. Peters-
burg, to inspect its art galleries— at that
time the finest in Europe but now, of
course, dismembered and scattered by
the Communistic hatred of all noble
values.
The next year the two lads elected to
take their holiday in Spain, always with
a view to its iart collections; in the
following years, Italy, Germany and
Austria, till they had covered all the
notable galleries in Europe. Paris was
merely a matter of running over at
week-ends for the Louvre and Luxem-
bourg, •
When still a youth, Howard came to
Australia, his mission sanctified by a
knowledge of the world’s best art. His
brother chose South Africa, where he
devoted his life and income to acquiring
a great collection of books, which he
bequeathed to the Johannesburg Public
Library. Both brothers, it seemed, were
motivated by the same selfless service to
the countries of their adoption. Howard
remained faithful to his first passion for
plastic art, and we know from his collec-
tion at the Teachers’ College of Armi-
dale, N.S.W., and his gifts to the National
Gallery in Sydney what a magnificent
bequest that passion has left this
country’s culture.
His love for art absorbed all other
passions. He never married ; he worked
hard at his business career only to
acquire money to devote to art, spending
nothing on himself except for the simple
necessities of existence, living in a single
room of the guesthouse where he spent
the major portion of his life, and keep-
ing a few specially treasured works in
a large trunk for the diversion of his
evenings at home, when it was his habit
to select a single work and enjoy a couple
of hours’ meditation over its qualities
and its aesthetic appeal.
I don’t know much about the business
side of his life, other than that he went
into the McArthur shipping firm as an
office-boy and worked up to the position
of a partner, from which he resigned in
middle-age, having acquired a sufficient
income for the purpose of his real life’s
work. On retiring, he took one more trip
to Europe for the refreshment of his
knowledge of its galleries, covering also
all the private galleries which he had
not been able to inspect as a boy. That
done, he returned to Australia to spend
the remainder of his life acquiring fresh
works to add to his collection.
Whatever his income amounted to, it
was enough for his purpose as prices
for pictures go in Australia. Even in
the early days, when he was a clerk in
the shipping firm, he bought works
within the range of his income ; but then,
our prices were within the range even
of a clerk’s wages.
I can recall him often in those
days coming to the counter of the
old Bulletin office and buying
examples of the pen-work of Lam-
bert, Mahony and others. And of
course he was one of the first patrons
of our Society of Artists’ exhibitions —
and very few patrons we had in those
days. My friendship with him dates
from that time; a friendship built on an
enduring affection, and one of the few
genuine rewards of a not-too-pleasing
personal struggle in our initial effort to
give this country a tradition in plastic
art.
Hinton never bought “names,” though
names 1 now established in the Australian
tradition were! attached to many pictures
bought by him. His object was to present
a comprehensive view of the best art of
his generation, and wherever an indi-
vidual talent expressed itself he bought
aq example of its effort. Affirmation of
any work was always defined in the
same compact terms: “I like it.”
He never talked aesthetics and never
denreciated a work that did not appeal
to him. It is amazing that a man could
nave passed his whole life in close con-
tact With the most splenetic of all worlds,
the studio world, and never have made
a personal enemy. There was something
truly Olympian in his detachment from
the essential indulgence in spite, envy
and rancor which agitates schools of
opinion in the arts. I never heard him
discuss ethics, aesthetics, polemics, or any
other abstraction over which mental
throats are cut.
Of course, under that kjndly, friendly
exterior there was a subtle mind at work,
with a perfect understanding of all the
fooleries and fanaticisms which have
shattered the studio world of today in i
bedlamite cataclysm of all values. But
that is a temporary process, begotten of
the same moral debacle which has in-
flicted two world wars on this earth.
Hinton himself is the evidence that no
iconoclastic lunacy can destroy estab-
lished values in the arts, for all through
this era of the studio clown and the wharf-
lumper in paint he went on quietly ac-
cumulating works of genuine virtuosity,
as, of course, did all the other Australian
buyers with a refined taste. It is a
notable fact that however vociferous the
minor intelligentsia may be in acclaiming
the evangel of Modernistic Primitivism
in art, it shows a marked reluctance to
back up its opinion with good hard
cash.
My own personal debt to Howard
Hinton is not one that can be paid. It
is not concerned with the encouragement
from his buying examples of my work
over the years, though I record gratitude
for the stimulus of his appreciation, in
which is condensed the understanding
that value lies less in the work that is
bought than in the mind that buys it.
What Hinton means to me in this respect
he meant to every other Australian
artist who strove to record a technical
integrity in his work.
My debt goes to a certain emanation
of the spirit from him that I can define
only by the bedraggled label of Faith.
Even in the blackest and most depressed
years, that emanation assured one that
the job was worth doing. He never said
so in words, of course, knowing that
words have no authority to affirm the
reality of deeds. That assurance was in
the whole content of his being: stable,
resolute, and enduring. It is a great
thing that in the course of a lifetime one
should have known one man who never
faltered in his credo of a love for life,
affirmed by his love for all art, which
in turn affirmed his credo.
But Howard Hinton and his life’s work
are of a significance that goes far beyond
its assumed objective. What he and his
type of mind represent is nothing less
than the moral energy which preserves
a country against a purely destructive
attack by war and politics. No country
can be totally submerged by either evil
while it maintains a high standard of
.culture. It may be attacked but it will
survive, and be the stronger for it.
The evidence of this defensive vitality
in a people, expressed by its culture, is so
apparent that it is a confounding thing to
observe how it is' invariably overlooked
by those historians who have studied the
rise and fall of nations. You have only
to follow the rise of all nations to a
state of world dominance and it is
obvious that their apex of power and
prosperity is reached only when some
great expression in the arts has also been
achieved. The moment that expression
falters into decadence, power and pros-
perity die with it. And when a country
deliberately debases its art, it is doomed
to extinction as a world Power.
We have had this phenomenon under
our eyes in the cases of France and
Germany; France by encouraging every
buffoon to degrade all high values in
art, and Germany by driving every intelli-
gent mind out of the country. Russia,
for all its bluster, is a country now
sterile of all cultural energy. It had a
culture in music and literature which was
a world contribution before Communism
bludgeoned it to death. And since
England has destroyed the moneyed
aristocracy which maintained its culture
we can only assume, with regret, that, fail-
ing some great resurgence of the spirit,
its position as a world Power is in danger.
America today is the only great nation
with an aristocracy which is spending its
wealth lavishly to endow every form of
culture. It has bought and is protecting
all that is greatest in the world’s art. It
has given sanctuary to all the virtuosos
and intellectuals that Europe in its death-
madness has cast out. Its endowments
to assist research and stimulate all intel-
lectual endeavor are endless.
And this, please observe, you moneyed
Australians, comes from the individual
rich man, and not from the State.
And if the impulse of the rich mah to
endow culture is not purely altruistic, it
is inspired by the soundest of rational
motives —and that is to protect his status
of power by giving back to the people
an equal return for the money extracted
from them. It is an amazing thing to
me that the moneyed man in Australia
cannot see that his own security and the
power to go on making money lies in
following the same protective policy. All
hjs foolish efforts to money-grub for
the sake of money—with no proposal to
devote his wealth to his country’s cultural
advancement-will result in his having
it taken from him by the State restric-
tions now being imposed on his income.
And serve him damn well right! We
have had only two rich men in this
country who have given their fortunes to
endow culture: Mitchell and his magni-
ficent bequest of a library, and Felton
with his bequest of money to the Mel-
bourne Gallery. Our culture has been
maintained by men of comparatively
minor incomes, like that of Howard
Hinton . . . professional and business
men who could just spare enough money
to dignify their homes with fine pictures,
and cultivate their minds with fine
books.
It was ia common saying of J. F-
Archibald’s that any man could write his
name across a city for as long as that
city endured by leaving a bequest to its
culture, even if that was no more than
an arch, a statue, or a fountain. And
Archibald has left his own name in
perpetuity by his fountain and his Archi-
bald Bequest to the National Gallery.
Every man with any conscious sense
of his own identity’ we must suppose,
treasures a dim desire to leave behind
him a posthumous reputation that will
keep his memory alive after his death.
And how easily that aspiration may be
attained by attaching his name to a
bequest that will endure after he has
gone. But our moneyed men strive to
take everything from their country and
give nothing back in return, and their
identity vanishes from the records of
mankind with the sods that are dumped
on their coffins.
But Howard Hinton, that kindly,
modest and most unassuming of men, has
left a monument to his own integrity of
isoul that will endure while Australia
exists as a nation. His collection of
pictures at Armidale, already unique,
will grow in value with the years. It is
the only complete collection of Aus-
tralian art in this country ; and one that
demonstrates a strange lack Of foresight
on the part of the trustees of our
National Galleries, where the works
least in evidence are those of Aus-
tralian artists. Knowing how prices
soar when artists die, it is stagger-
ing to conceive what the future
trustees of our galleries will have to pay
for works which might have been bought
for a few pounds in the days when they
were first offered for sale. This; is a
painful subject, but ope forced on our
attention by Howard Hinton’s wisdom
in preserving such a great mass of this
country’s finest art as a gift to the Aus-
tralian people and an enduring stimulus
to our national culture.

Various Verse
Mountaineer .
Never free of the mountain, no man ever
Held his own freedom so precariously
As he who takes the peak as lord, admitting
An icy will that makes the meagre plain
A dubious reality and takes
From simple days their core of consequence.
Although he walk the streets their sounds cannot
Rend the remembered silence, nor can life
Calling along the flat, decorous paths
Deny the voices singing an ascension.
How shall a garden win him, though prostrate
for
His sole content, while his desire returns
To the white beatitude, the fearful bride.
Shining on lovers but whispering with death?
The hungry rivers wait, the thickets spread
Their nets of night, the staring rockface hoards
Its purpose like a god, but he will tread
The wayward slope heeding no prophecies
That darken winds...

Far Other Worlds.
A white wind turns the daylight moon
And Time is whittled on that stone
Where fat heart sits when he is fed
And whets his grief when he is lean.
The living light upon that ice
Is transient amber in saints’ eyes;
There lovers wonder and, love gone.
Grief’s torture-pointed comets rise.
There flares the tree the mystics burn
And there is bent the tree of thorn
And griefs dog-buried in that land
Shall stand up green between the stone.

Bull's Head Inn.
Leaning into the hillside, it seems
Too frail to hold all the memories and dreams
That cling to its saga of walls more hardily
Than the beauty of the pepperina tree
Or the feline stealth of cat’s-claw scratching year
By year at its English attic-eyes. These peer
With century wisdom over the Downs; now
dimmer.
Maybe, but no less aware of the harvest-
glimmer, v
The new faces, pattern of change, and the
blue road —
Clean contrast to sully-red—with its traffic load,
Swinging out to War-wick, sweeping by
To Toowoomba under the summer-purple sky.
Grey souvenir of unremembered days,
Beside the transfigured bullock track it stays
The final clutch of modernity with a quaint
Wooden gesture of grace through its wizened
parchment of paint
And a genteel superiority of age
That erases past notoriety. A page
Of history heightened by a subtle fiction
Is turned in the local diary, crammed with a
diction
That puzzles but babbles a challenge to ardent
research.
A story survives the crease, the scrawl, the
smirch,
Shapes on the tongue and in the heart, reviving
Shadows of men who here designed a living.
To the sign of the truculent bull the Leslies rode,
Still vigorous from exploration; strode
Beneath the swinging banner, itself a dusty
Pioneer with hinges turning rusty,
And talked with Deuchar, Davidson, and Bell:
Poor aristocrats in a world, that could not quell
The blooded sound of laughter, pain of endeavor,
For all its wilderness. A Never-Never
Of undisciplined country slowly yielded to toil
And to dreams one vast communion of soil
With heart, of immutable stone with moulding
hand —
A confirmation came into the land.
O spacious days.. .Sir Joshua’s thoroughbreds
Neighed and champed in the senile stables there,
sleek heads
Thrust out seeking sunlight or the hard
Squatter’s-fondle; and from sanctuary of a
beard
The Reverend Benjamin Glennie preached in the
heat
Of Eighteen Fifty-six in a parlor less meet
For divinity than abiding odors of ale
Or the slap of thighs at a customer’s profane
tale.
Clark Irving, in Sydney anonymity,
“Stood’ 1 ’ for the Clarence and Darling Downs
that year.
His votes assured or lost with the Inn’s best
beer
By lamps that burned for prayer or gaiety...
The “Royal Bull’s Head” remembers in the
dusk:
Old English inn—O magic words —with the musk
Of flowers in the warm Australian evening
Perfecting the beautiful deception. Fling
The windows wide; let the harvest winds dally
With historic sashes. Then only bungally
And the gums under the crystal moon deny
The alien romance of the mind, and the eye
Darkens, disillusioned. But men’s desires
Bred tradition here that endures and inspires.
Go, lift the knocker of carved white brass and
raise
The pleasant ghosts of rediscovered days.
QUEENSLAND.

What causes the Aurora Australis?
It is a phenomenon caused by elec-
trical discharges in the upper atmo-
sphere around the south magnetic
pole. There is undoubtedly some con-
nection between sunspots and aurorae,
as at times of maximum sunspot
activity the aurora is more brilliant
and persistent. That the aurora is
due to magnetic influence is borne out
by the great disturbance it causes in
telegraph instruments and radio trans-
mission.

When a book is said to have been
published under a commission agree-
ment, what is meant? Is this form
of agreement to be recommended?
Under this form of agreement an
author agrees to bear all the cost of
producing the book and to pay the
publishers a commission on sales.
This method is not recommended to
a novice., Publishers are businessmen,
and if there is likely to be any profit
in a book someone will be willing to
bring it out at his own risk. Such
agreements are, however, quite useful
in the case of a book on some learned
but not widely popular theme, where
the author is not expecting any profit,
but merely wishes to give the result of
his work to the world.

Information concerning Australian
glow-worms ?
The so-called glow-worms of Aus-
tralia bear no relationship to their
European namesakes; they are the
larvae of flies belonging to the family
Mycetophyllidce, which includes the
fungus gnats or midges. These in-
sects are well known on the Blue
Mountains and at Bundanoon
(N.S.W.), and in the Otway Forest
(Vic.) in sheltered places under damp
rock ledges. In Tasmania the Gunn
Plains caves have a glow-worm cave,
where in the depths of the earth,
when the lights are extinguished, the
blackness of the cave-roof appears
to be studded with points of glitter-
ing light. The glow-worms them-
selves are thin whitish maggots, like
fragments of cotton thread crawling
about in the damp on a slimy web
spun by the insects themselves.

How to grow daffodils in pots?'
Plant one, two or three bulbs in
a pot, according to the size, but
never overcrowded. The best potting
compost is a mixture of some good
garden loam, silver sand and a little
well-decayed cow- or stable-manure,

If the answer is no to any of these questions—then, thumbs down on spending.
Goods of many kinds are in short supply. If you can do without, leave it for
someone who really needs it.
As for good value, it’s hard to get . . . but later on, there’ll be a better supply

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
“COLD WAR” GOING WELL.
Looking into the prospects for
this year, “World Report” ex-
pects “there will be fighting in,
Palestine and Asia, but World
War 111 is not in sight.”
That, at present, is a generally
accepted view in America; a
typical expression of it the state-
ment by N. Y. “Times” ex-
Moscow correspondent Drew
Middleton, cabled last week
(February 2). Middleton —much
too able and astute an observer
for Moscow, which refused him
re-entry into Russia when he
recently left on vacation —de-
clared that “an aggressive war
by the Soviet is not probable
for at least 10 years.” This
Middleton based on actual
Soviet weakness, in contrast to
apparent Soviet strength, con-
sisting mainly in numbers of
troops.
Despite recurrent scares, sure
to keep cropping up, many signs
of that kind of confidence
are appearing in the U.S., a vast
improvement since this time last
year ; very heartening if sound,
coming from one of the two
major contestants in any possible
world war.
The comparative optimism
is based largely on the fact that,
in the U.S.-Soviet “cold war,”
Russia has made no progress
for a considerable time; has,
instead, suffered a succession of
severe diplomatic and other set-
backs, and is having at least its
share of the prevailing troubles
much more publicised in other
countries.
The “cold war,” however, is
expected to be at its tensest this
year. Major tests in if, says
“World Report,” are about to
begin ; “the next 12 months may
decide the winner.” It is largely
a battle of diplomatic tactics
(with a powerful economic bol-
stering on the U.S. side), 'and
some of the present optimism
springs from the view that Soviet
diplomacy far from being
“brilliant” and “clever,” as it
has often been represented—•
has been all along clumsy and
blundering. Its major blunder
of the year, as typically assessed
by N. Y. “Post,” was “Stalin’s
refusal.,. .to join with Britain
and France in trying to bring
about European agreement on
essential requirements for re-
construction,” with American
aid. “By that act Soviet Russia
stood revealed as willing to
allow starvation, misery and
chaos to stalk Europe.... The
Soviet policy of rule or ruin
suddenly appeared stark and
real.”
Clumsiness was carried a stage
further by Molotov at the
Foreign Ministers Conference in
London, where, as summarised
by former U.S. Under-Secretary
of State Sumner Welles, all
Soviet obstruction achieved was
to “convince all of the French
people, outside the Communists,
that Soviet policy strikes at the
heart of French security,” to
give “greater impetus to the
creation of a Western European
federation,” to make it “im-
perative for the United States,
Britain and France to proceed
with the economic co-ordination
of the three western zones of
Germany into Western Europe,”
and to have “eliminated any
probability of Russian partici-
pation in an international con-
trol of the Ruhr.”
In N. Y. “Sun,” David
Lawrence, who has viewed the
widening U.S.-Soviet break with
more misgiving than has been
noted in most American com-
ment and has been anything but
unfriendly towards Russia, con-
tends that Russia, instead of
winning in the “cold war,” is
badly in need of help, but, by
their own clumsy tactics, the
Soviet leaders have manoeuvred
themselves into a position where
such help is impossible:
The bitterness of Russia toward the
Marshall Plan is largely because of
the inability of the Soviets themselves
to accept direct aid from the democ-
racies lest the Russian people dis-
cover the weakness of the Soviet
oligarchy in Moscow. The tirades
against America and Britain are due
to a misguided belief that somehow
inside the democracies there is a
substantial opinion which favors
Socialism or Communism or both and
that Russia can gain her ends by
dividing the democracies. Italy and
France were selected for immediate
attack. This has been recognised as
a crude manoeuvre transparently de-
signed to coincide with the pressure
of Russian diplomacy in the Council
of Foreign Ministers.
Out of months of silence on what
was really wanted by Russia and
months of propaganda outbursts of
a violently hostile nature, it .Becomes
apparent at last that the Soviets
desperately want money and economic
help. It becomes apparent, too, that
Russia is losing the “cold war” and
that the implications of the Marshall
Plan, even before it is actually trans-
lated into goods or dollars, are giving
the Russians an uncomfortable and
uneasy time.
What has appeared) as an un-
breakable deadlock, Lawrence
sees as now showing signs of
“yielding to the realistic facts of
Russia’s economic weakness and
the corresponding strength of
the three democracies.” While
Russia prepares for the future
with, on its home front, “a des-
per a t e economic situation”
which “bodes ill for the con-
tinuance of the Moscow dic-
tatorship,” the passing by Con-
gress of the “stopgap” U.S. aid
to Europe and “support of the
principles of the Marshall Plan”
will “disillusion the Russians
and bring to an end their pro-
tracted effort to win their way
by bludgeoning.” Lawrence
concludes that “the leverage for
bringing agreement at last seems
to be in the hands of America,
Britain and France.”
On Washington information,
“World Report” states that
“Russia’s recovery is faltering.”
One of the worst troubles is still
transport, which fell short of the
goal set for 1947, and is carry-
ing less than before the war.
“The Soviet Union will prob-
ably export some grain in
1948” —some of it going to
Britain—“but it will not be from
surplus ; it will come out of the
Russians’ own food supply.
Russia probably will not solve
its food problems for several
years”:
Poor planning is partly to blame
for the faltering pace of Russia’s
recovery. Soviet leaders believed
capitalism would collapse soon after
the end of the war. They reasoned
that capitalist countries, to keep their
factories going, would make large
loans to Russia. So the Russians
held their gold, waited for the col-
lapse.
But collapse hasn’t come. The chief
prophet of capitalist catastrophe, the
economist Varga, has lost his job.
But the damage is already done. The
urgently-needed goods Russia might
have bought a year or two ago are
no longer available. They will be
used in the Marshall Plan instead.
Russia’s battle against the Marshall
Plan and European recovery will have
to be fought with political weapons
alone. Russia, for several years, will
have no economic weapons compar-
able to those of the United States.
It is now widely accepted that
the Soviet rulers could not, even
if they would, follow a policy
of co-operation, because thereby
“the Soviet system might well be
exposed in all its defects. Many
authorities on Russia consider
that the Soviet leaders are the
victims of their own creation,
that they would not survive a
change in the system they have
built, and that they are not the
type of men to expose them-
selves to the risk that changes
might involve.”
“United States News” has re-
ported conclusions of U.S.
officials “who assess the present
outlook from a detached view-
point” :
U.S., to date, is winning its “cold
war” with Russia hands down. It is
winning with food, industrial equip-
ment, raw materials.
Russia is in trouble. She is having
serious difficulty in getting her in-
dustries going. Russia’s “Molotov
Plan” for Eastern Europe is designed
to drain resources of those countries
to the U.S.S.R. It is proving hard
to win friends and influence people
on that basis.
On the other hand, in the
European countries linked with
the Marshall Plan “recovery is
further advanced than most
people realise”:
Britain’s industry is producing at
115 per cent, of its 1939 rate. In
France, production is back to 93 per
cent, of pre-war level. Belgium is
producing at its pre-war rate, Hol-
land at near that rate; Sweden, Nor-
way, Denmark above pre-war rates.
Italy has made a marked recovery.
U.S. itself is producing at 182 per
cent, of its pre-war output.
In fact, though some of the
countries are still suffering acute
shortages, gradual recovery is
being reported everywhere in
the Marshall Plan area with the
exception of Western Germany.
If Congress, now considering
that Plan with, a strong brake
on anything like wild enthusi-
asm, should pass it in a reason-
ably substantial form, general
recovery is expected to be greatly
increased later in the year when
the full force of the scheme is
being felt, with rectifying the
stagnation in Western Germany
now listed as one of the open-
ing moves.
By an ironic twist, the posi-
tion has been reached where,
while the Soviet expectation of
a Western crack-up has been
proved a vain hope, there is
held to be some prospect of its
reverse —a Soviet crack-up. In
any case, the official U.S. view,
as reported by “United States
News,” now is that “Russia can-
not sabotage recovery in Wes-
tern Europe.” One of the most
widely-quoted American writers
on world affairs, Walter Lipp-
mann, after months of
vehemently attacking Truman-
Marshall foreign policy on the
ground that the “cold war” was
dangerous to the U.S. and should
never have been started, turned
a lively somersault after paying
a checking-up visit to Europe.
Lippmann wrote in N. Y.
“Herald Tribune”:
My strongest impression after a
tour in Eastern and in Western
Europe, and in Germany, is that the
Russians have lost the cold war, and
that they know it. We, on the other
hand, do not know this, and are
afraid to believe it, have mistaken
the violence of Mr. Vyshinsky’s lan-
guage for Russian power, and are,
therefore, unprepared to use construc-
tively the opportunity for a Euro-
pean settlement which is closer at
hand than we think it is.
“Recovery first, peace later,”
according to “World Report,” is
now to be “the American reply
to Russian stalling on peace
terms in Europe,” and, in Sum-
ner Welles’s summing-up, “Every
week that passes makes it less
probable that the Soviet Govern-
ment’s ultimate objective can be
achieved.”
Against the notion that Mos-
cow still wants delay on /all
fronts, Welles suggests that the
Kremlin’s recent tactics are
proof that the Soviet Govern-
ment realises that time is now on
the side of the Western Powers.
Given Congress endorsement of
the Marshall Plan on a suffici-
ently large scale, “Western
Europe, by the summer of this
year, will already be so far ad-
vanced towards solvency that it
will be highly doubtful that the
Kremlin can then hold its
Eastern European satellites in
line except by force.”
China War Secrets.
Advancing them as “useful in
judging the accusations of un-
dependability flying back and
forth across the Pacific” —that
is, between U.S. and China—
Scripps-Howard correspondent
in Shanghai Clyde Farnsworth
reports a couple of “secrets of
past American policy.”
Farnsworth declares that in
1944, when the Jap offensive was
slicing off south-eastern China
and ill-equipped Chinese armies
were turning it in, General Stil-
well was demanding in Chung-
king that Chiang Kai-shek sign
over all Chinese forces to the
Stilwell command. That would
have been tantamount to hand-
ing over the Central Govern-
ment Rejecting the demand as
incompatible with Chinese
sovereignty, the Generalissimo
promptly asked Roosevelt for
Stilwell’s removal.
Stilwell departed, amid con-
siderable sound and fury, and
Lieut.-General Wedemeyer suc-
ceeded him. “The world learned
nothing of the Stilwell demand,
but the crisis in Chinese-Ameri-
can relations became the first
milestone in a parade of accusa-
tions against the. Chinese Central
Government that goes marching
on today.”
The dther U.S. war secret, as
reported by Farnsworth, is just
as fantastic. In late July, 1945,
he says, the U.S. War Depart-
ment forwarded for Wedemeyer’s
consideration in Chungking a
plan to land the U.S. 10th Army
north of the Yangtze to join
forces with the Chinese Com-
munists and arm them for a
combined assault on Japanese-
held Shanghai.
Author of the plan was Stil-
well, then commanding the 10th
Army on Okinawa:
FortOnately for the Central Gov-
ernment, the war was just about over.
Execution of such a plan probably
would have delivered the lower
Yangtze Valley to the Red armies
and the Communist flag today might
be flying in Nanking.

Ideologues’ Paradise.
Why “the Russian political
order exercises a powerful fas-
cination upon the ideologue,” as
analysed by “Nineteenth Cen-
tury and After” editor F. A.
Voigt:
If Russia had but a strain of
liberalism, if she were more sparing
of human life and happiness, if she
were not such a menace to the world,
she would, indeed, have fewer
enemies, but she would have far
fewer friends, or rather adulators, for
she has no true friends.
She is, to the ideologue, a kind
of symbol, and the dream-world of
his secret ambitions, a world in which
he is master, in which he can, merely
by uttering a fiat, initiate prodigious
reforms, a world in which he can
send all who stand in his way, all
who excite his envy, malice or anger
by their independence and by their
elevation of mind and character, to
death or to the worse-than-death, a
world in which he can be Public
Prosecutor, in trials where there is
no defence, or People’s Commissar
for Education, Propaganda, or For-
eign Affairs, without being mortified
by any opposition or criticism in the
world of letters, or science or in any
Parliament. Here, in this dream-
world, the ideologue finds happiness,
here he garners the adulation which
he believes to be his due, here he
can satisfy his reforming zealotry,
here he can satiate his lustful rancor
and soothe the intolerable itch of his
vainglory and his ambition.
Europe’s Children.
Still with some of the bitterest
of the winter to go through,
20,000,000 children in Europe,
according to a survey made by
N. Y. “Times” correspondents
in the various countries, are
“living in squalor and misery,
in cold and fear.” As an ex-
ample, the survey quotes a
“world-famous doctor” reporting
from Rumania; “Hundreds of
nearly-naked children are roam-
ing the countryside in an eternal
search for food. Many were
casualties of mine-laying and
have lost legs and arms. Whole
families are existing on cucum-
ber soup and on bread made of
dirt and straw.”
Not all Europe, said the sur-
vey, is in straits so bad as
Rumania’s, “b u t everywhere
children in such numbers that
the future of whole nations is
at stake are underfed, under-
clothed and living in a state
bordering on savagery.”
One of the worst spots all
through has been Greece, where
there were already 300,000 or
more orphans of the Second
World War before 150,000 child
refugees of Greece’s own civil
strife were added.
Even Rumania is not the
worst of the Balkan States:
child-welfare experts who have
visited all those States rate
Albanian children as being in
the greatest need: “A compe-
tent official has estimated that
the infant-mortality rate in
Albania is almost 50 per cent.,
which is nearly double the worst
rate recorded in any other
European area.”
A brighter side of the survey
is that “in no area of national
and international recovery is so
much being done to fight the
consequences of war. Perhaps
even more significant, in no
other field is there so much
honest non-political activity that
cuts right across the East-West
barrier.”
Dragnet Digest.
The Pinch in Britain. —Revisiting
Britain, N. Y. “Times” woman writer
Anne O’Hare McCormick reports the
people there as now visibly showing
they are feeling the pinch. They
are, she says, developing a lean and
hungry look they never wore before:
“One notes especially the sharpened
faces of the workers To Americans
the English used to seem impervious
to the cold, but now even the long-
coated policeman shivers as he admits
that the blanketing fog is ‘a bit thick’
or the clammy air ‘a bit chilly.’ ”
Mrs. McCormick adds that “women
look more strained than men.”

Arms for Palestine. —Though com-
menting that “Nothing could do the
Zionist cause more damage [in the
U.S.] than the existence of clandes-
tine gun-running operations illegally
shipping arms to Palestine,” N. Y.
“Herald Tribune” makes out a
reasonable enough justification:
“Everyone, so far, has shirked the
question of security and defence for
the proposed Jewish State, yet in
the harsh world of today it is obvi-
ously the fundamental question in
the whole Palestine problem; and
if the other nations will not them-
selves fight for the Jewish State then
they must clearly afford to it the
means of fighting for and defending
itself.” In what Dr. Evatt is happy
to think an “achievement,” U.N.O.
made the Palestine decision, and the
shirking of that fundamental issue is
the measure of U.N.O.’s weakness.

The Singapore Base. A report
published in Australia that “Singa-
pore is finished as a great Empire
bastion” differs from the account of
a “Christian Science Monitor” cor-
respondent, who reports Singapore
as again “fast becoming one of the
chief bases of Great Britain’s army,
navy and air strength in all Asia.’
It is “no longer paraded as an im-
pregnable fortress,’ ” but both Army
and R.A.F. have established Far
Eastern h.q. there, and “the Singa-
pore naval base does the refitting for
the East Indies station, whose home
is Ceylon, and the British Pacific
Fleet, operating out of Hong Kong.
Singapore is meanwhile serving as a
staging area for British troops being
withdrawn from India. A Gurkha
division will be the main military
strength.

Telling Tito— Washington “Post”
expects Tito to cause further inci-
dents” over Trieste, Moscow bemg
able to tell him “to go the limit with
America because America will not
retaliate”: “The same message must
have gone to Albania’s Hoxha when
the Albanians sowed the mines in
Corfu Straits which wrecked British
ships and drowned British sailors.
The British didn’t retaliate. They
brotight up the atrocity before the
United Nations, and were confronted
with a Soviet veto on United Nations
action. It is time to tell these two-
bit barbarians to cut out the non-
sense. Instead of sendmg No te !
(which are effective only with civilised
Powers, anyway) let us notify the
United Nations that we intend to
strengthen the Trieste garrison. Police
action will cow the conuc-opera
strutter in Belgrade just as effective y
as it did after he shot down our
pilots, and we sent over a bomber
with a Note insisting on reparation.
Recent U.S. moves in the Mediter-
ranean appear designed to tell U»
and Moscow that America is, in taci,
in a mood to retaliate sharply*

DISRAELI'S EXAMPLE.
Parliament re-assembles next week at
Canberra in an inflammable atmosphere
brought about by disorders following the
decline under “Labor” rule of the political
institutions and the industrial health of
the nation. No enemy during the two
world wars ever damaged our industrial
and social prospects as has the party
elected to guide the Commonwealth
through the post-war reconstructive effort
—an effort calling for national co-opera-
tion no less urgently than the late war itself.
Compared with devastated European
countries, Australia, facing this obliga-
tion, had great advantages. There was,
and is, even help offering from overseas
for material aid in the job. All that
was necessary was for the chosen leader
—and he happened to be Mr. Chifley—
to trust to - the character of the people,
assist every effort to mobilise the initia-
tive for which they are renowned, and
repress firmly any malicious or treacher-
ous elements which set themselves against
a national purpose. Mr. Chifley was not
blind either to the opportunity or what
it demanded. He has made a mess of it,
and if he does not realise that now, then
his administration grows the more dan-
gerous daily.
Looking back over two and a half
years since hostilities closed, we can see
now in full extent the evil “Labor” has
dene to Australia and the falsity of its
pretences to govern in any interest but
that of its own pressure-groups and
vested interests. In the name of sociali-
sation as a recipe for his “Golden Age,”
Mr. Chifley—endowed with a great trust,
though with but poor natural qualifica-
tions to fulfil it —has directed the political
wing of his party in parallel course with
the industrial wing of union bosses in in-
discriminate assault on every institution
which made Australia what it has been.
The legislation to expropriate and social-
ise the trading banks is an unmitigated
mischief wrought against the nation’s in-
dustrial enterprise and a perfect corollary
to the Communist-inspired strikes.
Towards the same end —the greed of
a minority and the permanent regiment-
ing of the community —“Labor” under
Mr. Chifley has attacked the very founda-
tions of the Australian Constitution: the
integrity of the sovereign States as parties
to the Federal compact. Past decisions
at referendums seeking powers to author-
ise this encroachment have been ignored.
“Labor’s” steady progress, by fair means
or foul, towards establishing a Federal
monopoly of internal air transport is as
gross an affront to the people’s expressed
will as the planned suppression of the
trading banks. Both these moves, and
the coming prices referendum, have the
manifest purpose of forcing the States out
of their constitutional rights.
It is the duty of the Liberals (in which
term for convenience, as for any
practical purpose, the Country party must
be included) to produce the statesmen
who will lead Australia back from what
Disraeli once called “the march of the
caravan (lured by mirage) towards the
heart of the desert.” They may, and
probably will, have to do some things
reckoned in the narrow party view “un-
popular,” But the corrective required is
not to be interpreted solely from a party
point of view. The first aim must be to
conserve the heritage and institutions be-
queathed from our fathers. Some
overhauling of the Constitution is due,
but the interests, not of the States, but
of the people in their State institutions,
must be recognised, and plans laid for
the extension of those institutions in new
States. By this means, or some other,
the Senate must be restored as something
of a States’ House.
Disraeli fought much the same battle
in Britain 80 years ago, and it is signifi-
cant that Englishmen are turning back
to study Disraeli’s example for support in
resistance to “the new despotism.” In
that struggle people here and in the
Mother-country are finding today a com-
mon political language. The real wealth
of England, Disraeli insisted, was the
character of her people;
The traditions of a nation are part of
its existence. Its valor and its discipline,
its venerable laws, its eloquence, its scholar-
ship are as much portions of its life as its
agriculture, its commerce, its engineering
skill If it be true that an aristocracy
distinguished merely by wealth must perish
from satiety, so I hold it equally true that
a people who recognise no higher aim than
physical enjoyment must become selfish and
enervated. Under such circumstances some
human progeny, distinguished by _ their
bodily vigor or their masculine intelligence
... .will assert their superiority and conquer
a world which deserves to be enslaved.
The Radicals of Disraeli’s time sought,
as the historian Arthur Bryant writes in
his English Saga, “to destroy Mon-
archy, Church, property, and local in-
dependence in the name of abstract
equality, and to reduce the British Par-
liament to a single vote-counting
assembly enforcing the edicts of despotic
party caucuses and State officials.”
Against this movement in the name of
“progress,” Disraeli “reinforced the in-
stinctive but inarticulate conservatism of
the ordinary man with a reasoned body
of principle capable of withstanding the
iconoclast on his own ground.” He
showed them that the House of Com-
mons by itself could not preserve liberty,
that election votes alone could not secure
the people their rights “if the use of
power entrusted by those votes to the
ruling few was not kept in check by the
existence of institutions strong enough to
resist the abuse of executive power.”
Change is constant. The great question
is not whether you should resist change
which is inevitable, but whether that change
should be carried out in deference to the
manners, the customs, the laws, the
traditions of the people, or in deference
to abstract principles and arbitrary
doctrines.
That was Disraeli repelling the attack
on the Monarchy, the established Church,
and the House of Lords in 1867. It is
as fresh now as when it was first spoken,
and as true against the Socialists under
the Chifley and Attlee banners as it was
against the Radicals behind Gladstone.
If our rather cautious Liberals will
study Disraeli they might discover the
reason why great numbers of English
working-men, trade-unionists and all,
have continued to vote Conservative even
with a Labor party in existence.
A New Labor Outlook.
Even Sherlock Holmes’s somewhat short-
scented offsider would find diagnosing the
dominant outlook of trade-union labor
in Australia elementary. He could com-
press it as the Unions v. the Rest, and
the last ones to dispute the finding would
be the union bosses.
That concept is accepted in terms of
perpetual hostility between the two camps
-—the assumption that all who are not of
the unions are against them, and that
the unions must keep up a relentless front
of hostility. In a word, the basic Com-
munist concept of the class-war.
If, as usually happens, any attack in
this war claims a huge number of non-
attacking unionists as victims, that is just
too bad for them. The war must go on,
though—as in the most recent attack
launched on the N.S.W. coalfields—per-
haps half a million in various States, the
great bulk of them unionists, may be
threatened with unemployment when it
is personally urgent for them to be work-
ing and earning.
The openly-boasted tactics of the strike-
leaders were that it was timely to attack
while coal-bunkers everywhere were prac-
tically empty. A generation or two of
strike-leaders —nearly always without any
firm Government opposition' on behalf
of the Rest —had planned and led strikes
in the deliberate strategy of in due time
bringing about that consummation. It
has taken years of consistent effort to
reduce all coal reserves to the point now
reached —where threat of a strike is threat
of the stoppage of industry generally.
The mistake in the latest coalfields attack
was in overlooking that just then pockets
as well as bunkers were empty. It was
timed a bit too soon after Christmas.
The so-called “Governments” in Syd-
ney and Canberra were as somnolent as
ever. These outfits are scared stiff at the
thought that, should they move to assert
the law on behalf of the community, some
Communist squib would dub them
“strike-breakers.” Their conception of
their part is to hold the ring; to see that
the law is left inoperative ; to do nothing
that might make them appear other than
with the union involved, right or wrong.
As it happened—luckily, temporarily,
for the Rest —the cries of the prospective
stricken on this occasion rose loud in the
land. But the Unions will come again, for
the bunkers must not be allowed to fill.
Steel output is already lagging because of
inadequate coal. To permit bunkers to
fill would plainly be against the whole
strategic idea of the class-war. The
position as things are is that the Com-
munist-led forces working on Jhat
strategy have the Rest by the throat, and
so long as they have the passive assist-
ance of “Governments” like those at
Sydney or Canberra, and so long as
unionists at large accept an inferiority,
class-struggle concept of the part of
unionism, they will easily hold their grip.
But that position, though wretched
enough for Australia, need not be beyond
cure. There are the clearest portents
that impotent Governments of the present
Sydney and Canberra pattern are on the
way out. Like the unionist votes;
which helped oust the professedly
impotent Cain “Government,” the general
unionist outcry against the N.S.W. coal-
fields strike was by no means all merely
mercenary. It had some element of good
healthy Australianism in it; some signs
of a better outlook at least trying to
break through.
What the great bulk of unionists would
like to see somehow brought about is a
complete change in labor-management
dealings. They would like to see an end
of intolerance everywhere. They would
like to see operating in the wider field
what is in fact operating all the time in
most places of employment. That, in a
word, is co-operation—the commonest
feature of places of employment taken
separately, and the rarest on the wider
level.
As a general working model they might
point to such an arrangement as Sweden’s
industrial “Parliament,” as reported by a
visitor. The “Parliament” consists of the
Confederation of Trade Unions and the
Federation of Employers, each with equal
rights and powers. Through joint com-
mittees the “Parliament” works out labor
and production problems. In it are
thrashed-out questions of wages and
hours, working conditions, job-security,
pensions, apprenticeships, occupational
accidents, safety committees, production-
costs, business slumps and sales pro-
grammes.
Obviously, it would call for a great
change of outlook before anyone could
think of such a system in Australia. The
whole picture of perpetual hostility is
against it. Nor can anyone visualise in
Australia certain similar aspects of labor-
management dealings which lately caused
London “Times’s” labor correspondent
amazement on a visit to America. Some
of the correspondent’s findings must
sound even more amazing here, including
his quoting from Mr. Philip Murray’s
presidential report to the last C. 1.0. con-
vention. “The situation,” declared that
labor leader, “demands production, pro-
duction, and more production.”
The “Times” man noted, as likely to
prove “of great long-term significance,”
that U.S. unions are “devoting ever closer
attention to research, education and
public relations,” one result of which “ex-
pansion of their thinking” has been “to
give them a closer understanding of pro-
duction problems and a stronger realisa-
tion of the importance to them of high
productivity”;
Their whole approach to this subject is
radically different from that of British
workers [not only different from but directly
opposed to the prevalent concept in Aus-
tralia]. Their aim is not a socialist com-
monwealth, but “More and more, here and
now,” as Samuel Gompers used to put it.
They accept free competition and have
long realised in theory that the bigger the
cake the larger their slice may be, and
that higher productivity is therefore among
their most vital interests.
Other items in the same report sound
utterly fantastic taken in contrast with
the starve-industry-at-all-cost attitude en-
forced by the apostles of the class-war
concept and for long meekly accepted by
the Australian unionists now at last here
and there showing some faint signs of
kicking against it. That at least four
named unions “have experts who give
technical advice to employers” sounds
like a stroke of Gilbertian satire in an
Australian context; but that is nothing:
The clothing-workers have a bank which
lends them [employers!] money. In indus-
tries where there are many small employers
these unions perform some of the functions
of a trade association. Among the newer
unions the steelworkers have worked with
individual small employers in difficulties to
help them improve their efficiency and so
remain solvent.
As another arresting aspect of such co-
operation, consider the “spectacle of both
employers and workers giving evidence
before a Congressional committee in
favor of an increase in the Federal mini-
mum wage.”
It all sounds like news from Utopia;
none of it more so than the acceptance
of the principle that the first requirement
from the unionist no less than from the
general community viewpoint is produc-
tion, production and more production.
"In the Police-Vam."
Impudence in international affairs has
never reached such heights as in the
Soviet Union protests against actions by
the United States. Colossal impudence in
a great Power has rarely achieved so little.
Moscow objects to United States air-
craft flying low over Soviet shipping in
the Yellow Sea—through which supplies
are being carried to the Communist
armies of Manchuria. It protests against
the occupation of an aerodrome in British
Tripolitania by the United States on the
ground that it is a breach of the peace
treaty with Italy. The plain fact is that
the airfield is under legal British suze-
rainty and the United States occupation
is by British consent.
The Russian protest in this case is part
of a policy of Communist infiltration to
control Italy, By bullying, by stirring-up
the population, by every method possible
Russia is seeking to kick all Allied forces
out of the Mediterranean, which it pro-
poses to turn into a Communist sea.
The final subject of Russian protest —
for the present —is against the action of
Americans who are supposedly building
large aerodromes in Persia, arming the
Persians and generally enabling them to
resist the pressure of Russia to force
them to hand over control of oil areas
and the Azerbaijan province. The
Americans are doing no more in Persia
than they have done for many years, and
they have done considerably less than
the Soviet Union.
The significance of the situation lies
not so much in the fact that Russia has
protested on all these alleged breaches of
international behavior as in the recep-
tion which the protests have had in the
outside world. The most apparent reac-
tion to Soviet aggressions and imper-
tinences in countries around the U.S.S.R.
borders has hitherto been fear.
These States have seen Finland dis-
membered and its population brutally
decimated so that Moscow could achieve
strategic territorial gains which would
make it' easier for the Kremlin to con-
trol the Baltic and bully Sweden and
Norway. They have seen the little peace-
ful Baltic States of Latvia, Estonia and
Lithuania seized with force and all
of the population which would not bow
the knee to Stalin murdered in cold
blood, sent to slave-camps in Siberia or
made fugitives in foreign lands. They have
seen Communist “kings,” scourges in the
hands of the Soviet Foreign Office (which
trained and employs them) placed on
the thrones of Bulgaria, Yugoslavia,
Rumania, Poland, Albania and Hungary;
and Austria, Italy, Greece and France
threatened with similar subjugation.
They-saw U.N.O. quietly accept a former
Norwegian Communist as its general
secretary on Moscow’s nomination, and
a citizen of the Soviet Union appointed
as his senior assistant.
Now there is. fear no longer, but only
horror and repulsion, a deliberate accept-
ance of the implications of Russian
actions and a determination to resist
them. Persia’s response to her bullying
neighbor’s protest last week was a firm
rejection coupled with an accusation, so
open that the Government would not have
dared to make it a few months ago, that
when Russian troops occupied Azerbai-
jan they assisted “a batch of terrorist
traitors” to rebel against the central
Government and kept them in power
until the Persian nation overthrew them.
It was added that the Soviet Union was
still succoring these insurrectionists.
Turkey plucked up courage and with-
drew its Ambassador from Moscow.
Canada, which has had ample proof of
the treacherous intentions of the Soviet
Union, the same week refused to allow
Soviet military attaches to attend
Canadian Army manoeuvres until such
time as similar courtesy should be ex-
tended to Canadian attaches in Moscow.
The United States treatment of Mos-
cow’s objections to its actions was no
less firm than the blunt declaration of
Mr. Marshall, accusing the Kremlin
openly of “sabotage”—an “ugly word”
in such a connection, as Mr. Churchill
promptly commented —and followed Mr.
Attlee’s almost derisive summary of the
creed of those who practise “democracy”
behind the iron curtain;
These people claim to be in the van of
human progress. They are only in the
police-van. In the field of human rights
today Russia and Eastern Europe are at
the back of the queue.
Mr. Attlee said that Britain was not
prepared to accept Communism, and
that “if Western civilisation was to stand
against this ideological assault it must
attain a degree of unity.” This was a
blow to Soviet ambitions, the harder
since it followed a cordial American
official reception of Mr. Bevin’s pro-
posal for a Western European union
and declaration of a foreign policy
which has not only encouraged the
“Benelux” countries ’ — Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg —to take
immediate action for unity, but which
also, having secured the approval of the
United States, has forced France to make
an early choice of her path and imposed
the need on Czechoslovakia to determine
whether it will attach itself to the eastern
or western zones of Europe.
Not the least of the portents of the
times isi the fact that while Moscow was
rejoicing last week at “the deserved
fate” of the Royal Navy, whose capital
ships have suddenly disappeared from
their historic haunts, three modern
American battleships appeared off the
English coast and, with the usual cover-
age, began manoeuvres in the Channel,
based upon the British naval port oi
Weymouth. At the same time squadrons
of the R.A.N. and U.S.N, were at sea
together on manoeuvres.


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Showdown Draws Nearer
The Communists’ mobilisation for their
general strike is moving forward. The
seamen under Comrade Elliott have for
some time played merely chorus parts in
the preliminary strikes staged by other
militant unions. That the coalminers and
the wharfies could put strangleholds on
industry was apparently sufficient for
purposes of the moment and the seamen
did not sacrifice their luxurious pay.
Now other orders are out. Boss Elliott
is putting his union dupes on the warpath
in Queensland as a pipe-opener to “a
general strike of Australian seamen within
four weeks if a claim for another £l2
a month is refused.” They already re-
ceive a minimum of £22 6s. and all found
in luxury. The originating move was the
demand on behalf of a few nightwatch-
men on Brisbane River dredges for pay-
ment while sleeping, but the real motive
is defeat of Hanlon’s illegal-strike law.
In Melbourne the other day Elliott,
approaching Premier Hanlon (then visit-
ing that city), rebuffed Hanlon’s sugges-
tion that his complaint should be referred
to the Industrial Court and had the
effrontery to say that he would select ships
and cargoes for boycott in order “to up-
set Government plans,” especially in the
transport of building materials. This is
sheer political blackmail of Hanlon,
who nipped a railway strike in the bud
last month by threatening to use his In-
dustrial Act penalties. The railway work-
shops there have taken a ballot, and all
the railways are idle as a result.
In Melbourne, on the excuse that rises
in prices of commodities shall be halted
while the price of labor soars to any
giddy height, the Communist executive of
the Ironworkers’ Federation has recom-
mended a “one-day stoppage in all key
industries in Victoria.” This follows
Communist Brown’s announcement that
his A.R.U. will call on all unions to exert
“force to change the leadership” of the
Melbourne Trades Hall (1) in retalia-
tion for its “failure to plan any real cam-
paign against the Essential Services Bill,”
and (2) to insist on “more definite action,
including direct action, against rising
prices.” Simultaneously the A.C.T.U.,
having the whip cracked over it, an-
nounced action for repeal of “all punitive
industrial laws on Australian statute-
books,” especially
The Commonwealth Defence Projects
Act,
The Queensland Industrial Act,
The Victorian Essential Services Act,
and “similar legislation which the S.A,
Government proposes to introduce.”
The pattern is quite clear. Those
“sanctions” which railway-union execu-
tives have, with endorsement by the coal-
miners, threatened against States that
oppose socialisation of the banks are
already going into operation in the form
of strikes and tie-ups.
Not merely are a couple of determined
State Premiers to bo put in their place,
according to these union plotters, but the
political A.L.P. is to be taught a lesson
for daring to declare war on Communist-
infiltration of the unions and for setting
up “true-blue” industrial groups from
which Communists would be banned. The
F.E.D.F.A. secretary in Melbourne, warn-
ing the politicals that the union can break
them by refusing funds, has withheld his
own union’s dues for the present quarter.
The showdown is inevitable, and in-
dustry as a whole is simply marking
time until it comes. There can be Only
one result; these union dictators will be
beaten and overthrown. Whether the
process is short or long depends on the
mood of the public and how much it is
prepared to endure before it turns and
rends the contemptible crowd in Canberra
that has allowed this Communist inso-
lence full rein.
Braund and Cancer.
Cancer kills more Australians than any
other disease. The Commonwealth
Year-Book remarks that, although the
national death-rate from all causes has
diminished substantially, that from cancer
has risen continuously. No wonder that
when press publicity was given to claims
by an elderly Sydney layman named
John Braund that he was “successfully
treating cancer” he should attract the
notice first of Australians and then of
the world. ‘
Out of the hurly-burly of a Sydney daily-
press uproar it appears, amongst other things,
that Braund himself is 78 years old and appar-
ently a “little difficult,” with “his head in the
clouds.” Following a furious controversy be-
tween newspapers, doctors, scientists and the
public, the N.S.W. Government was forced to
form a committee to investigate his claims.
, b the beginning, Sydney “Sun,” cautiously,
discovered” Braund. Claims of cures were made
and names given. A manufacturer, E. J. Hall-
strop* promised £20,000 to establish a
clinic, being “absolutely convinced” of
Braund’s claims (“Sun,” 30/1/’4B), This-im-
Eelled Premier McGirr to take some interest
i the matter. The news reached America. Cine-
sound filmed Braund removing a “dead cancer”
from a man’s body. A couple of days later
Braund “rejected a committee set up by the
Premier”; would only consider one “of five
or seven laymen” (“Daily Telegraph,” 2/2/’4B).
Braund and Hallstrom had a sharp differ-
ence, Braund asserting that he wasn’t going
to be bossed about by Hallstrom. All the
same, Hallstrom was ready to give Braund
£lO,OOO if he cured three cases of certified
cancer.
Braund referred to the help of the
Deity in his work. The “Sun’s” afternoon
rival, the “Daily Mirror,” a little soured
and somewhat sceptical, offered, with epithets, a
“£5OOO Challenge to Braund” (£2OOO for curing
a certified malignant cancer, £5OOO if Braund
could draw a liver-cancer through the patient’s
back). Braund refused to see a “Mirror”
reporter.
After more crossfiring in the press, and re-
ports that Braund had been “invited to start a
clinic in Melbourne,” Premier McGirr visited
Braund, whereafter it was announced that a
committee comprising four doctors nominated
by Braund, four by the 8.M.A.,
N.S.W. Opposition Leader Treatt, C. C.
Lazzarini, M.L.A., Hallstrom and Dr. Morris,
N.S.W. Director of Public Health, had begun
the investigation. Braund and Hallstrom, it
was reported, had shaken hands.
The “Sun” all along had placed reliance
on the advice of Dr. Henry Brose — Whof's Who
for 1947: “M.A., D. Phil. (Oxon.), D.Sc.
(Adelaide), F. Inst. P.; Pathologist and Bio-
chemist. Bora in Adelaide, educated at Prince
Alfred College and Adelaide University, Rhodes
Scholar to Oxford in 1913.”
Dr. Brose* in a feature article, said in effect
that Braund’s method consisted of injecting
a fluid into the patient’s bloodstream which
destroyed the cancer cells, after which the
dead cancer was removed. Dr. Brose said he
had been watching Braund for four years, and
hadn’t the slightest doubt that he “could cure
some forms of cancer 1 am sure he. has
the answer to the problem of the malignant
growth.”
The most striking “evidence,” however, came
from John Charles Giffard, a Melbourne
engineer. Giffard is the man from whom Braund
took the growth in the Cinesound film. In
this Braund says he has been treating
cancer for 20 years, can recall “many, many
cures and definitely 318.” Four persons in the
picture testify to having had cancers cured
by Braund. All claimed that no knife was
used and that they felt little or no pain.
In the film Braund a rather alert and
determined-looking man for his age—is seen
to lift from beneath Giffard’s chest a bulbous
object through an opening in the chest. Giffard
immediately gets up and walks to the micro-
phone to tell his story, showing the apparent
cancer in a bottle.
Braund told the “Herald” that he was fined
£3O in Melbourne in 1945 for a breach of the
Medical Practitioners’ Act, adding that he “was
ignorant of the law then.”
Latest report on Monday was that a Can-
adian cancer victim was flying to Sydney
for treatment. Obviously, in the interest
of suffering humanity, a fair and autho-
ritative pronouncement is needed on the
“Braund method” with the least possible
delay ; and in this regard Mr. Braund him-
self should give the utmost co-operation.

th ?u nc r C WaS mentioned m the interview
with Mr. Ward on December 6, 1947, repl ,
It was. In Gardens anger he said.
Jimmy Brett wanted it, he would get it.
Isaacs: Brett is the man who, m R ‘

t 0 iiT/ r j *!? »t iu j u
What did Mr. Ward when Garden me -
tioned Brett? I think it was in the last pa t
of the conversation when Mr. Ward said.
Dont be silly, Jock.
In reply to further questions, Forshaw sa d
neither Farrell nor Garden had attempted to
dissuade him from seeing the Minister.
On the ninth day of the case Mr aa s
produced records from the Bank
Newtown, and Urquhart was recalled a
questioned about his bank accounts and a
safe he had bought in March, 1945.
Isaacs; What did you want a safe for.J
was carrying large sums of money. Iwa
betting heavily at the time. . ftn
B * Q *u^ Uy 1944 v t0 uy 9 ’ 1946, £28,400
went through your cheque account at New-
town?—l don t think that would be correct.
I was drawing out £4OO, £5OO or £6OO on
Fridays for my betting. I would replace much
of the money or all of it on the Monday,
When Urquhart said he ceased keeping
Jgf nVTch’W
out '*
Urquhart: I can’t recollect,
Isaacs: To the nearest thousand? (Laughter),
- 1 1S eing unny ’ you
j 0 tbe nearest hundred pounds?—l still can’t
recollect.
Give us some idea approximately?—l had
no occasion to remember it.
To Mr. Shand (for the Crown) Urquhart
said the highest balance he had at any time
in the Newtown account was £3lOO. That was
in April, 1945. He had betting-slips and a
record of the numbers of his -tickets.
James Reginald Halhgan, permanent head
Qf the Department of External Territories, said
s j£ Ce the suspension of civil administration
in New Guinea no permits or leases had been
granted for timber areas On May 19, 1945,
he informed Mr. Ward by memo, that Parers
lication could not be ap p roved . He met
Parer on May 2 s, 1945. Parer did not say
he held any licence or concession in the Bulolo
Valley. In December, 1946, Parer applied to
the Minister to expedite permission to cut and
j mport timber to Australia. A letter from
[he P Minister to Pa rer dated January 26, 1947,
t t d that the area was native-owned and
was reqiiired by the Plywood Board. On
December 18, 1947, the Minister informed
p arer j e tter that it was not practicable to
grant Parcr ’ s application. To Mr. Shand,
witness said he had told Garden in February,
m7> that nothing could be done about Parer - S
application, as policy did not permit it. To
Mr. Isaacs, he said Mr. Ward had never told
hjm he ha ’ d seen parer sonall about the
matter> Mr Ward bad p quested him to see
Garden, and bad sa j d that Garden was press-
ing b ] m abo ut finalising Farer’s application.
On the last day of the hearing Mr. Ward,
recalled, said it was untrue that he had told
to address a letter to Garden. He
would say definitely that Forshaw had not used
tbe W ords “It would not be that easy for
Parer » He had not read the letter of
November 10> 1947> addresse d by Forshaw to
Garden, before it was produced in court. He
be]ieve J he had hanc j cd the letter to Mr.
Halligan
“The acknowledgment I signed would come
in with the neral mail and l did not rcad
the original j| tter from Forshaw.”
Isaacs: You signed the acknowledgment
without having seen the letter?—That is so.
At tbe d i scuss i on about the Waria Valley,
after Mr. McAdam had said something about
d not be j ng a commercial proposition, did
you say: “I think you had better leave that
t the people spending the money”?—No.
Ward p de p ied that he had said “Don’t be

silly, Jock,” and said he had no recollection
of Garden saying “I don’t want it next year
or next month. I want it now. We will never
get any finality in this thing.”
James B. McAdam, Acting-Secretary of the
Department of Forests in Papua, said he was
present in Ward’s oflßce on December 6, 1947,
when Forshaw interviewed Ward. Garden was
also present. McAdam had said he did not
think the Waria Valley proposition was feasible.
Mr. Ward had said the commercial interests
who were going to risk their capital would be
the best judges of that. Garden appeared to
be unduly excited during the interview, and
at one stage said Jimmy Brett would have been
able to obtain the licence. At some stage ot
the interview Ward had said “Don’t be silly,
Jock.”
When the Crown case was completed
Mr. Shand, K.C., said it had been proved
that the letter of November 10, 1947, had
been sent in a sealed envelope to Garden,
that it had clearly been opened by Gar-
den, because a typist had had the letter
produced to her and had been asked to
type the last page in an altered form.
That, in itself, was a false document,
and the signature on the page was stated
in evidence to be a forgery. He held
that the evidence supported a charge of
false pretences under the N.S.W,, Crimes
Asked by Mr. Atkinson, S.M., if he
had anything to say. Garden replied, I
am not guilty and I reserve my defence.
In committing Garden for trial the
magistrate amended the charge to one of
falsely pretending that he (Garden) and
others had become entitled to take up
New Guinea timber concessions and
thereby, with others, obtaining £50,000
fromi Hancock and Gore; of J-
letter addressed to the Minister (Ward)
and signed “H. G. Forshaw” ; and of
forging a letter to Parer signed m the
terms “E. J. Ward, Minister, per J. 5.
Garden.”
POLITICAL POINTS
It was abruptly announced at the week-
end that' Dr. Evatt would “lead as
counsel for the Government” in the bank
case before the High Court. Who’s going
to “lead” in Palestine? Cal well?
Stafford Cripps has warned Britons
solemnly that if they do not knuckle
down completely “within weeks, not
months or years,” and act “in general
agreement” on “sound economic lines”
under his socialistic outfit, they will have
to submit to “some form of totalitarian
government.” That Cripps appears
to contemplate “totalitarianism” without
a general election shows how socialistic
power rots the political soul of even the
best “Labor” Minister,
Britain has a “‘Labor’ Government”
which can claim “full employment,” has
“nationalised” the Bank of England,
coalmines, airlines, railways and canals,
and is hell-bent on “nationalising” the
iron and Steel industries —as was here
threatened by our Mr, Forde in 1941.
Yet Cripps, the ablest man in the “Labor”
Ministry, said at the week-end that “only
the declining gold reserves of the sterling
area stand between Britain and disaster,”
and, saving the miracle, he dourly fore-
shadowed “some form of totalitarian
government.” Does this convey anything
to Australian “Labor”? If it does, no
sign has been vouchsafed.
Queensland got out of bed on Monday
morning to find the whole State railway
system brought to a stop by strikers
in the workshops. O’Brien, State
president of the A.R.U., unchastened
by a comparatively paltry fine for
a previous strike, bellowed that “when
the men were at work they were
unable to have their claims heard; now
they’re on strike they’re told they cannot
be heard. How do we get into the Arbi-
tration Court?” Premier Hanlon —
Queensland is watching him with keen
memories of how Premier Hollway settled
the Melbourne tram strike—had neither
spoken nor acted when this went to the
printer,
O’Brien, Queensland A.R.U. president,
went on the air to justify the railway
strike, whining that the men couldn’t get
their claims heard by the Arbitration
Court: “We have been waiting since
April, 1947, to have our claims heard.”
He was apswered from two sources. An
Industrial Court man said that if O’Brien
did lodge a claim in April, “almost im-
mediately afterwards he went to the
1.L.0. conference in Europe.” O’Brien
had been offered a date in February, but
at his own request it was deferred to
March 2. Labor Minister Gair’s ver-
sion was that O’Brien had refused the
February date because he had “to attend
a conference at Bundaberg.” O’Brien
didn’t want a date —he wanted a strike,
and now he’s got it.
A Melbourne “Age” paragraph (June
25, 1943):
The immediate appointment of a Royal Com-
mission to investigate the assertions of the
Minister of Labor, Mr. Ward, regarding an
important defence document in relation to “the
Brisbane Line” was announced by the Prime
Minister, Mr. Curtin, simultaneously with an
intimation that Mr. Ward had been “relieved
of his administrative duties” pending sub-
mission of the Commission’s report to Parlia-
ment.
Don’t you remember the occasion, Ben
Chifley?
From the 1938 edition of “Hansard”:
It is amusing to hear people say that we
shall not give up New Guinea. To those people
I would say that if it should become necessary
to defend our mandated territory, they should
defend it themselves. As far as I am concerned,
all I can judge about the necessity for retaining
New Guinea is that a handful of exploiters have
got hold of the country, some interested in
aerial transport, some in goldmining, and some
in the search for oil, which, according to reliable
reports, has already been found. These people
want to retain New Guinea in order to preserve
their commercial interests.
Who said it? Ward!
Ex-publican, ex-M.H.R. Breen, fox
whom “Labor” found a job as Trade
Commissioner in Cairo after he lost the
Calare seat in 1946, has chucked up the
post and is returning to Australia. To
take on a civil job? Well, not immedi-
ately. To begin with he’s to be Ward’s
secretary.
Eire, to De Valera “an independent
republic, associated as a matter of ex-
ternal policy with the States of the
British Commonwealth,” has deprived
him of his majority in the Dail. But it
fell heavily on the Mcßride-headed Re-
publicans, who want to cut loose from
the British Commonwealth altogether;
only ten were elected and 20 lost their
deposits. De Valera’s Fianna Fail re-
mains much the strongest of the five
parties and groups (there are also a
dozen Independents), and he looks like
trying to regain his majority at another
election, as in 1944. In that year he won
76 seats out of 138 (there are 146 now),
after having been reduced to 67 at a
poll taken 11 months previously.
What go-slow blockade of Australian
ports —and especially in Sydney—means
to shipping freights has to be seen to be
believed. Goods consigned from Mel-
bourne to Sydney under invoices dated
mid-December had not reached the
hands of consignees by the first week
of February. Freight from overseas in
vessels which reached Sydney six weeks
ago is still there. Port delays
' have reached a stage where a ship
has in two months done half of a
round voyage between Sydney and Mel-
bourne —three days of which time were
actually spent at sea. What a Govern-
ment !
Supply Minister Ashley, making up his
book on petrol imports, is laying odds
against the forecast of Vacuum Oil’s
local chairman that imports from N.E.1.,
soon to increase, will not permit rationing
restrictions to be relaxed “this year or
next year.” What does he know? That
the wharfies who dictate Government
policy in this region, and have re-affirmed
their ban on N.E.I. trade, will not permit
trade with Sumatra?
With “dramatic suddenness” (what will
Actors’ Equity say?) Dr. Evatt declared
that he intended to appear for the Gov-
ernment in the bank-nationalisation
cases. The Cabinet, which rumor has
declared to have done the deciding for
the Doctor, seems to be less concerned
about his Palestine Commission, opera-
tions of which are threatened with for-
cible jettisoning by Britain and the
U.S.A. And his plan for disciplining
Franco has ended by the substitution of
another plan under which Spain is likely
to be welcomed as a beneficiary of the
Marshall scheme. France, Communist
howls notwithstanding, has reopened its
Spanish frontier, and “trade talks” are
to follow.
It’s come out that about 1000 of 1500
so-called Jewish refugees heading for
Palestine aboard two ships spoke Russian,
some fought with the Red Army or be-
longed to “various Balkan Communist
organisations,” and some weren’t Jews at
all. What’s more, they had been allowed
to move about the Balkans at will, where
ordinarily nobody stirs a foot without
Communist permission. Britain has “pro-
tested” to Rumania about it.
Victorian State Council of the A.R.U.,
of which Communist Brown is boss-
cocky, has called on “all trade-unionists”
to help it “change the leadership” of Mel-
bourne Trades Hall. What is biting
Brown, apart from his recent defeat in
Adelaide, is Hollway’s Emergency Ser-
vices Bill and the “failure of the Trades
Hall executive to plan any real campaign
against it.” The union Brown bosses also (
passed a resolution calling for “more
definite action, including direct action,”
to check rising prices, and demanding
that “no price-increases be granted for
any commodity unless justified in a
public inquiry in which trade-unionists
would participate.” What about in-
creased prices of labor, and current union
demands that they be paid whether a
public arbitrator after inquiry: grants
them or not?
Ever since the war ended the Hanlon
Government in Queensland has been
doing its best to put private road trans-
port out of business on the grounds that
it competes “unfairly” with the State
railways. On Monday the State railways
were paralysed by a workshop strike.
There was a prompt howl for help to the
road-transport men, promising them
everything from extra petrol to police
escorts if they’d do what the Govern-
ment had been trying to stop them doing.
Victoria’s Lib.-C.P. Government pro-
poses to set up a new transport authority
to control all forms of public transport
in the State. It’s a necessary reform,
since few Victorians know where one
transport authority begins and another
ends; but it will have to be watched to
see that it doesn’t become a weapon
against private motor transport in favor
of Government-run railways. ,
Thus young Mr. Fraser, oracle of
Eden-Monaro in the Federal Parliament:
People are wrong in believing that the
Commonwealth Bank will be the only bank
functioning under nationalisation....
actually the only change will be the
replacement of present directors of the
trading banks by others appointed by the
Government.
And presumably all these new directors
will be instructed to compete like billy-oh
against the “180 new banks” and
“tremendous increase in the staff” of the
Commonwealth Bank (B. 18/6/ ’47) which
the governor, Mr. Armitage, said last
June he had arranged to establish
throughout Australia,
One of those Sunday-paper boys who
never let the Opposition dogs get the
better of it has discovered that “Labor”
is “in the box seat.” No prize is offered
for spotting the redundant word.
The Six-hour Day Art Union—to build
a new Sydney Trades Hall—is an even
more curious performance this year than
last. On February 8 an expensive
advertisement appeared in the Sunday
press announcing that the drawing had
been postponed till February 14 and that
“all money, butts and unsold tickets must
be returned not later than February 7,
1948.” Let the Liberal or Country party
try to do a thing like that: let them, in-
deed, even apply for a permit to hold an
art-union to raise funds for political pur-
poses and see what happens.
Biographical note:
In 1901, as a cubr reporter in Kalgoorlie, I
had something to do with two interesting
characters —Keenan, the mayor, a Liberal lawyer
from Ireland, and Johnson, the Labor M.L.A.,
a carpenter from Maoriland. Keenan became
the member in 1905, when Johnson moved to a
snug coastal electorate, Guildford, and in
subsequent years, during which Keenan shifted
to Nedlands, each saw the other have two
periods of Ministerial office, Johnson as well
becoming Speaker of the Assembly. Both were
re-elected last year. Their old association has
been broken by the death of Johnson at 75
—Keenan is 81. Though inveterate opponents,
each had a high respect for the other’s ability.
Johnson turned wheatgrower, helped Westralian
Farmers from the beginnings of their enter-
prise, and when I saw him last was trying to
give the co-operation movement a shove for-
ward in N. S. Wales. A Minister of parts,
he might have become Premier in 1904 and
again in 1911, but on each occasion was passed
over for a better mixer.
The latest body to constitute itself a
supernational authority in Melbourne is
the Transport Workers’ Union, which
announced its intention of beginning a
ban on deliveries in the city on Monday
“until kerbside parking by private cars
is stopped.” Union officers will be pro-
vided to picket the streets to prevent
evasion. It isn’t stated whether they will
be supplied with uniforms and tommy-
guns.
A strike of sanitary-carters last week
deprived several Sydney suburbs of what
the “S. M. Herald” accurately described
as “an essential service.” The blokes who
leave the poetical notes at Christmas-time
went back to work on the understanding
that their claims for a wage-increase
would be heard by the Court on Thurs-
day ; but what surprised thousands of
Sydney’s stay-at-home citizens was the
realisation that so many suburbs of Aus-
tralia’s biggest wen are still unsewered.
They include Bankstown, Premier Mc-
Girr’s electorate, and part of Hurstville,
which Clive Evatt represents but does not
live in, although he shares a telephone-
number there with brother Bert.
The Commonwealth Statistician ex-
pects a wheat yield of 228,000,000 bushels
from the harvest just collected —a record
that would have been greater only for
bad weather. Mr. Pollard’s offsiders in
the Department of Commerce reckon it
will be worth about £170,000,000. What
the grower is to do with his share of
the money isn’t explained, since he can’t
buy material or machinery with it, coal-
miners and the like not having got stuck
into their job like the farming commu-
nity.
Last Friday McGirr, the Sydney
Premier, was loudly trumpeting some-
thing about scores of British manufac-
turers heading for his State to build fac-
tories all over the place, importing
material to build them and men to work
in them. A lot of people, aware that
established industries couldn’t get enough
power and raw material to keep them
occupied, wondered what Mr, McGirr
was talking about. On Monday, with a
coal-strike threatening, they wondered
again.
Mt. Isa strikers have turned it in and
gone back to work. Their strike was
against an alleged delay in hearing claims
for a lead bonus; the 800 or so on strike
lost about £25,000 in wages; they de-
cided on work when they got together in
a mass meeting.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Colonel Hugh B. Hester, recently
appointed U.S, Military Attache to Aus-
tralia, is no newcomer to this country;
for three war years he was in charge
here of procurement of U.S. Army
services and supplies. Born in North
Carolina, the colonel has seen little of his
home-town of Hester (named after his
great-grandfather) since he joined the
Army in 1917, but he still has the link
with home through his voice—a real
Southern drawl. Formerly on the Berlin
staff of the Military Governor of the
U.S. Zone, he applied Australian
appointment as “the Australians were so
much like the friendly sincere people of
the U.S. south and south-west.”
In his own words “first and foremost
a farmer and land-valuer,” Joshua Ross-
Taylor is entitled to the prefix Sir and
has been farming at Duns, Berwickshire
(Scot.), for 45 years, concentrating on
Aberdeen-Angus cattle for the last 25.
He got his knighthood for good work
on committees of the Department of
Agriculture of Scotland, is a director of
the Highland Society and ex-chairman of
the National Farmers’ Union of Scot-
land. Australians will be able to judge
the man at Easter, when he’ll be in
Sydney to judge Black Polls for the
Sydney R.A.S.
Australia’s first aircraft-carrier will
have as commander Captain Roy Russell
Dowling, D.S.O. He entered the R.A.N.
from Jervis Bay in 1915 as a cadet mid-
shipman and earned the King’s Gold
Medal. A lieutenant in 1923 and
commander when the war started,
he served in the light-cruiser Naiad
from the day she was commis-
sioned until she sank under the weight
of German bombs in the Mediterranean
in 1942. He was at Cebu, Wewak, Brunei
and Balikpapan in command of H.M.A.S
Hobart, and took his ship to Tokyo Bay
after the surrender. Director of Ord-
nance, Torpedoes and Mines before his
new appointment, Dowling sails in the
Orion to attend R.N. courses before tak-
ing over his new command.
Cables announcing the death of Lord
Derby, at 82, detailed his racing career,
and added as an afterthought that during
the first world war he was Director-
General of Recruiting and Secretary of
State for War from 1916-18. The refer-
ence hardly did justice to the old boy’s
record of public service, which was
already a long one when he succeeded his
father as 17th Earl of Derby in 1908. A
lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards, he
went to Canada as A.D.C. to the
Governor-General in 1889, and was
elected to the Commons as member for
West Houghton in 1892, holding the seat
until 1906. He served in the Boer War,
first as Chief Press Censor and later as
private secretary to Lord Roberts, and
was twice mentioned in dispatches. For
five years he was one of the Lords of
the Treasury, and in 1900 became
Financial Secretary to the War Office,
leaving that post to become P.M.G. in
1903. After succeeding to the title he
served two terms as Lord Mayor of
Liverpool, and at the end of the first war
was sent to Paris as British Ambassador.
He resigned in 1920, and again held the
post of Secretary for War in the Bonar
Law Administration and the first Baldwin
Government. As Director-General of
Recruiting in 1915-16 he was responsible
for the “Derby scheme,” the final attempt
to maintain the Army on a voluntary
basis. That it failed was no fault of its
originator, and its breakdown tardily con-
vinced the country that modern warfare
demands universal service.
A veteran diver at 26, Colin Kerby,
who descended 500 times to cut up the
Kakariki hulk off Gellibrand Light, Mel-
bourne, is now making a living harvesting
Melbourne’s bumper mussel crop in his
family’s backyard—the Kerbys live in the
St. Kilda pier kiosk. He spends several
hours daily below, sending full baskets
to the surface every few minutes.

Dubois’s impression is the second
recent pictorial record of George Herbert
Patterson; the other is Eric Wright’s
Archibald Prize entry, described by artist
James MacDonald as “the portrait of a
very determined gentleman”—MacDonald
knew the subject in Egypt in the first war.
Determination, among other qualities, has
brought Patterson to the top of the adver-
tising game and put him on the board of
Peak Frean biscuits and Gillette razors.
As a very considerable sideline he holds
ADVERTISING AND RED CROSS.
several positions m the Australian Red
Cross, being vice-chairman of the N. S.
Wales Division, and chairman of the
Social Services Committee, which he
founded. Last year Patterson attended
a Red Cross conference in Geneva, and
returned with two stories which seem
to have escaped Australian notice —one
problem set the Red Cross is the rehabili-
tation of German prisoners-of-war held
by Russia since 1914-18 and lately re-
leased into Allied zones; another faced
and overcome was the German intention
towards the end of the war of blowing
up concentration camps, prisoners and
all. Swiss Red Cross men saw both
Hitler and Himmler, while some of them
went into the concentration camps (on
the condition that they remained in them)
and personally deloused the mines with
which the camps were seeded. Patter-
son has a keen interest in art, artists and
antiques; he plays golf and tennis, and
mention of trout-fishing will set him talk-
ing almost as enthusiastically as he does
of the Red Cross, particularly about its
work on behalf of disabled Diggers.
“Becks” farewells the first of the
many:
Forty-four years after making the first flight
in a power-driven heavier-than-air machine,
Orville Wright died last month at Dayton, Ohio,
where he was born and lived most of his 76
years. The success of Orville and his brother
Wilbur in solving the problem of flight was
no lucky fluke; the two gave years of study
to it, analysing the methods of previous experi-
menters and reading everything that had been
written on the subject, including papers by
Lawrence Hargrave, to whom they later paid
tribute. On the sand-dunes of Kitty Hawk,
North Carolina, they watched the flight of sea-
birds and realised that the secret of flight lay
in the proper control of the angle of the
wing-tips and -surfaces. This was the germ
of aileron control, now universally adopted in
planes. The Wright brothers built their machine,
powered her with a 12-h.p. motor of their
own design and, on December 17, 1903, flew
her at Kitty Hawk. It fell to Orville’s good
fortune to make the first flight. The four
flights made that day were all of less than
a minute’s duration, but the problem was
solved. Man could fly; from there on it was
just a matter of improving the means. The
brothers continued their experiments, took their
planes to Europe and shared with other pioneers
the thrills of the first decade of flying. Wilbur
died in 1912, honored, like his brother, by
many European countries as well as his own.
Four years before that Orville had been injured
when a plane he was testing crashed. He flew
after that, but the effects of the accident re-
mained with him, forcing him to give up
flying in 1918. The company which he and
Wilbur founded commemorated his first flight
a few years ago by giving the name Kittyhawk
to a fast fighter plane.
Alexander Macintosh, of Wellington
(M.L.), has just notched his century. A
native of Welwyn, Hertfordshire, he
joined the Aberdeen Town and Country
Bank, Later he linked up with the Bank
of Queensland, and when it was wound
up was offered a job with the Commercial
Bank of Sydney, In 1889 he became
general manager of the Royal Bank of
Queensland, then, crossing the Tasman,
he became chief auditor and later g.m.
of the Bank of N.Z. After three years he
retired and went to Sydney, to accept
the presidency of the new commission
when the Government of N.S.W. placed
its State Savings Bank under a Board of
Commissioners. Back in M.L, again he
filled several big jobs till his retirement
from active service in 1916, one being
a director of the Wellington Publishing
Co., proprietors of the “Dominion.”
“Ek Bum’s” memory of departed
greatness:
I met Gandhi a little over 20 years ago.
My memory is of being projected out of a
hot, monsoon-season sun into the moist coolth
of a verandah where unwinking brown eyes
stared out of heaps of white washing. There
were several naked brown children who invaded
the interview at intervals and there was a large
goat which had to be occasionally driven away
from the packet of sandwiches reposing in my
topi. The Mahatma himself was laid out on
a charpoy, brown shaven head, somewhat ser-
pentine, rising from his draperies at the upper
end, and two brown and well-used legs emerg-
ing from the other end and culminating in an
expressive set of toes which seemed to take
as much part in the conversation as his tongue.
With eyes shut it would have been like in-
terviewing any other member of the English
bar, except that at certain points one came up
against a wall through which European and
Oriental imaginations were unable to join.
I asked him what he thought would be the
greatest factor in settling the problems of
all-India rule and he said: “Time!” adding
that patience and fortitude were the vital
weapons of the weak and lowly and that since
the oppressed were involuntarily armed and
compelled to use these weapons through force of
circumstances and since they outnumbered their
oppressors millions to one, they were sure to
win in the end by sheer “spiritual momentum.”
At this stage the goat succeeded in acquir-
ing a large bite out of my sandwiches
and was shooed off by the entourage with
much good-humored laughter. I asked the
Mahatma whether he thought time and patience
would recover my lunch. To which he re-
plied: “No. But the world is full of sand-
wiches. The animal cannot defeat you in
getting your meal even if she went on eating

twinkle in his eye, “I hope she won’t. For at
present she is full of the milk for my dinner.”
The dapper figure presented here by
Coventry belongs to Edward James
Ranembe Morgan, president of the In-
dustrial Court of S.A. since 1941, and
chairman of the trustees of the National
Gallery, Adelaide. A generous patron

he couldn’t draw a straight line to save
his life. Born at Warwick (Q.) 48 years
ago, he moved to Adelaide as a boy.

went through Saints’ and Adelaide
’Varsity and was called to the Bar in
1921. After several years in private

Adelaide Police Court Bench in 1934 and

years later, •
Australia has discovered singing police-
men and singing blacksmiths. Mel-
bourne’s forthcoming Australian grand-
opera season at the Princess is to have
the services of a singing milkman, who
will make his debut in the same role as
John Brownlee in “Aida.” According to
Miss Gertrude Johnson of the National
Theatre, which is sponsoring the out-
break, Harry Jenkins has a voice of
superb quality and outstanding dramatic
ability, and in him is another great Aus-
tralian vocalist in the making. He is now
an airline employee.
Invalided out of the Royal Navy, 27-
year-old Melburnian John Michael
Avison Parker has been appointed equerry
to Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of
Edinburgh. A product of Xavier Col-
lege, Melbourne, he joined the R.N. after
being rejected for naval service in Aus-
tralia. While serving as a lieutenant in
British destroyers in 1941 he first met the
Duke. They became good pals and were
transferred simultaneously to H.M.S.
Wessex in the Pacific Fleet, Foreign
correspondents see in Parker’s appoint-
ment evidence of a Royal visit to Aus-
tralia within the next year or so.
Public Library of S.A. gets a new
principal when George Henry Pitt takes
over from Herbert John Keyes, who re-
tires shortly. Pitt, a graduate of Adelaide
Uni., is well known for his work in estab-
lishing the Archives Department in S.A.
More recently he has been chief of the
free-lending service at the Public Library.
Before taking the principal’s chair he will
investigate libraries abroad under
arrangement with the British Council.
He’s 55.
Tom Tunnecliffe, M.L.A., dead at 79
in Melbourne, was one of the last of the
old-style Labor leaders. He was a man
of considerable culture, loved quoting
from the great poets and writers and
enlivened his discourse in Parliamentary
circles with literary allusions. A socialist
of the Wells and Shaw school, he once
joined with poet Bernard O’Dowd in
launching a radical monthly, the “Tocsin.”
It didn’t ring long, but was revived later
as the “Labor Call.” Tunnecliffe edited
“Stead’s Review” for some years and pub-
lished several now-forgotten books on
socialism. He got his learning from the
Public Library in Melbourne and the
Working Men’s College. After trying
his father’s trade of bootmaker he entered
politics as M.L.A. for West Melbourne.
Later he represented Eaglehawk, and
when he lost that seat he took a long
lease of Collingwood. Three times a
Minister, with a short-term as Acting-
Premier, he became leader of the Vic-
torian Labor party in 1932, and was
Speaker from 1937 to 1940. Like E. J.
Hogan, he was at one time a Bulletin
contributor.
Into the Silence:
At Geelong (Vic.), at 80, Herbert Highlord
Wettenhall, famous in sheep-breeding circles
for developing, with his father, the comeback
type known as the Ideals. He was also one
of the promoters of inland freezing works.
In Adelaide, at 75, Dr. Frederic John Chappie,
who practised in the Glen Osmond district for
many years. A graduate of Melbourne Univer-
sity, he was the eldest son of a former Head
of Prince Alfred College, Adelaide.
In Melbourne, at 94, Andrew Wilkie, whose
connection with the Melbourne Zoo lasted 70
years. From the job of gardener he rose to
be director in 1923. He retired in 1936, but
came back later in charge of the Australian
section.
In Adelaide, Madame Delmar Hall, teacher
of singing at Elder Conservatorium for 35
years. She came to Australia with her husband,
H. Winsloe Hall, in 191.2. He died early; she
taught on until illness forced her retirement at
the end of last year.
In Adelaide, at 67, Ludwig Schwab, who
came from U.S. with a world-wide reputation
an accompanist to Kubelik, and afterwards
joined Adelaide Conservatorium, where he added
to his viola repute and built up a strong violin
school. His widow is pianist Merle Robertson.
In Adelaide, at 88, Gilbert J. Dawbarn, for
12 years Professor of Engineering at Ballarat
School of Mines. Bom at Wisbech, Cam-
bridgeshire, he graduated in science at Glasgow
University under William Thomson, later Lord
Kelvin. Leaving Ballarat in 1907 he became
chief engineer of the Wallaroo and Moonta
Company and retained that position until the
mines closed down in 1923.
In Melbourne, at 63, Alick Watkins, leading
cattle authority and owner of many good race-
horses. He was a director of F. Watkins Pty.,
Ltd., for many years.
At 58, in Melbourne, William George Mc-
Beath, chairman of directors of Makower and
Mcß'eath. A son of the founder of the
business,, he was a patron of art and of
charitable causes. He was commodore of the
Royal Yacht Club of Victoria from 1930 to
1938.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Sixenate”: A fine feminine distinc-
tion cropped up in a suburban court case.
A young man on the beach had had his
face smacked by a beauchous damsel; he
summonsed her for assault, as he ex-
plained, to force her to apologise for an
unprovoked insult. The lady’s explana-
tion was that he had stared at her
rudely and she felt the smack was
fully justified. Yes, she had been
attired in a very modern swim-
suit. The magistrate wanted to
know why women wore those provoca-
tive outfits if they did not want to be
noticed; he thought they wanted to be
looked at. “We don’t mind being looked
at; but to be stared at is insulting,” said
Eve. Reasonable enough, perhaps; but
the magistrate ordered her to apologise
or pay a fine.
* * * *
“Eve”; I’ve always been vaguely
interested in wool, whether it’s in bales
or still on the sheep. But I’m a bit
wary now, since going up in the lift of
the building where the wool-sales are
held in Sydney. I said to the driver,
“The place is quiet today.” He nodded,
“Yes,” he said. “It’s only sheepskins
on today. Sheepskins go real quietly.
It’s the wool that makes the row!”
* * * *
“E-Jay”: “Bo’s” appreciation of
Richard Tauber pays tribute to the
tenor’s full-throated attack on a top C.
Tauber was easy on the ears, but I’m
darned if I ever heard him tackle a top
C iq a way anyone could describe as
“full-throated.” Come to think of it, I
can’t recall his tackling one at all.
“Old Australian”: Can’t see why the
initial “1” should be “the great bugbear of
the Latin and Teuton trying to sing in
English,” since the initial “1” is the most
frequent sound in Italian, sufficient
evidence of which is the fact that the
masculine and feminine articles are il
and la. Further, I doubt whether Italian
could possibly pronounce “love” as
“yove” even if quite uninstructed in
English. There is no letter “y” in the
Italian alphabet, the “i” being used in-
stead in a limited range of words, and
it would hardly occur to an Italian to
convert the “1” of his daily use into an
“i,” whatever language he was using. An
Italian on a first attempt would prob-
ably pronounce love as “lohvay,” and
on a second effort “lohv” —but never
would he say “yove” (yuv) or “yohv,”
The main argument above applies also
to the French. As for the Teuton—well,
the German word for love has the initial
, “1,” and that ought to settle the matter.
♦ * * *
“Suvic”: Charged with “milking”
petrol, an ex-p.-0.-w. pleaded guilty,
saying he had learnt the “art” while a
prisoner. It has always been a source
of wonder to me that men who lived
under p.-0.-w. conditions so quickly re-
sumed normal life on release. I stole,
swore incessantly and fought authority
in every open and underhand way. Home
again, my only lapses were occasional
curses breaking through my re-found re-
spectability. And it wasn’t because I
didn’t notice chances ; every piece of food
seen, whether alive or dead, was auto-
matically assessed for “thievability.”
* * * *
“Horty C.”: To the increasing number
of articles stowed “under the counter”
add blood-and-bone mixture. After
walking the city recently I did strike
some, the seed-bloke seeing from my
face that I was kind to my dahlias and
that my feet hurt. Giving the wink, he
proclaimed loudly: “Sorry, blood-and-
bone’s been off for years.” As other hope-
fuls turned away I took the cue and inter-
ested myself in some peat-moss. At last
there was a lull; he shot a furtive glance
at the only other customer, a lady up at
the far end inspecting bulbs, and dumped
a pound of the stuff on the counter with
a whispered plea to keep it under my coat
until I was well away.
* * * *
“Tetapi”: A friendly stranger gave
me a lift into Melbourne, and on the
way we passed at least a dozen swaggies,
I remarked that none of the gentlemen
of the road looked round expecting a
lift nor did he seem to think of offering
one. “Yes,” he said, “things have
changed. My father used to drive once
a week from Swan Hill into the city
"He's a Wolf in sheep's clothing!"
and back and he always stopped and
gave the bagmen a lift. After he had
driven them a few miles he would pull
up and politely ask them to get out so
that he could accommodate a couple
of other members of the fraternity. The
world’s getting worse instead of better.”
At that moment we passed one of the
shimmering blondes mentioned by
“Allwet” in his par. on the Melbourne
tram strike. My friend nearly tore the
tyres off his back wheels as he rammed
the brakes on.
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: I never thought the time
would come when I would admit that
Tin Pan Alley has improved my edu-
cation, but I’m forced to admit the fact;
a popular classic establishes that Sioux
is pronounced Soo. But my long-
cherished inhibitions rebel at the thought.
Of all the redskins that thrilled me to
the marrow in my barefooted days—
Crow, Apache, Pawnee, Cherokee and
the rest —none sounded so deliciously
bloodthirsty as Sioux, pronounced Sykes.
There was something about the name
that set up a glorious blood-tingle when
the hero was making a desperate last
stand in the blockhouse. But who’d
be deliciously frightened of an Indian
named Sue?
* « * * *
“Jurumudi”: The two American
marines who got themselves tattooed in
Melbourne and developed leprosy three
years later, as reported by the Michigan
State Medical Society, weren’t isolated
examples of the extraordinary risks and
sufferings victims of the fashion will put
up with. During the early 1930 s the
habit developed into a craze, and the
few practitioners of the art had queues
of young men and women outside their
premises in Flinders-street on Friday
nights bigger than the handout queues
at the Exhibition-street cafes. A year
or so later the craze subsided, but the
queues were as large as ever —this time
composed of girls who wanted to have
the evidences of their aberration re-
moved. This involved thousands of
deep punctures with the needle, an in-
tensely painful operation. Yet during
the war the queues became as long as
ever. The craze was on again, possibly
through the example of the G.ls.
* * * *
“F.S.”: “Strop” says (B. 28/l/’4B) that
photography is as much an art as music,
with rigid rules of grace, harmony and
balance in composition. In the case of
the Adelaide competition he cites no
doubt the award was inevitable, but not
for the reasons “Strop” thinks. The
girls who get the prizes at the beauty
contests are the ones who look most like
Jane Russell, Marlene Dietrich or Betty
Grable, but the judges no more know
why they seem more beautiful than the
others than the judges of phptographic
competitions. As for the Old Masters’
alleged rules of composition, I would ask
“Strop” to make a simple experiment.
Let him take, say, a Rembrandt repro-
duction and cut it into squares, rectangles
or any shapes he fancies. If he can prove
that what is contained within each frag-
ment isn’t as perfect a composition as
the whole picture I’ll swallow, any make
of camera he chooses to nominate.
* * * ♦
“Uco”: Plastic beer-bottles (B. 4/2/’4B)
may be the means of doing away with the
broken-glass menace, but the idea isn’t
so simple as it sounds. There are
plastics and plastics. Some substances so
labelled may not harm the beer; some
may even improve it; but others will make
it taste like stale grog from an unwashed
drip-tray. So much for the effect of the
bottle on the beer; but what about the
effect of the beer on the bottle? I’ve
tasted beer that would eat its way through
any plastic in 24 hours. On the other
hand the stuff they dish up at my local
pub late on a hot Saturday is so thin it
could sneak through the pores of the
container. Taking it all round, I think
we’d better put our beer in unshatter-
able glass.
“Youanmi”: The only difficulty I can
see in “Melbn’s” recommendation of
plastic bottles for beer (B. 4/2/’4B) is the
price of the bottles. The other day a
chap strolled into my office and casually
tossed a bottle at me from several feet
away. Startled, I fumbled the catch and
the' thing bounced resoundingly across
the floor. On closer examination it
appeared to be made of a smoky-white
plastic which felt like wax (it was much
harder, of course), had a welded bottom
and a screw-top. British made, it was
practically unbreakable, unaffected by all
acids, including hydrofluoric, and but
slightly affected by some of the more-
active solvents. The only snag was the
price—about 15s. each, wholesale.
* * * *
“Bulljo”: G. K. Chesterton, a great
singer of beer and optimism, must have
chuckled to himself in the Elysian Fields
when he read about the 40-year-old
woman tavern-owner of Oregon who,
after obtaining her 15th divorce, could
maintain cheerfully that she still hoped
to find the right man.
* * * *
“Oliver Filter”: Sunday evening and a
revivalist meeting in full swing down the
lower end of Sydney, when along stag-
gered a happy soul having some
difficulty in keeping his legs from plait-
ing. He had been able to fill him-
self with alcoholic refreshment and was
carrying as emergency rations two brown
bottles. He wavered to an uncertain
halt beside the singers, listened intently
for a while and added a few amiable in-
terjections ; then one of the missionaries
moved up and spoke to him very earn-
estly for about 15 minutes, gently took
his bottles from him and led him to the
centre of the ring. With tears of alco-
holic grief the roisterer treated the audi-
ence to a full confession of his past
misdemeanors, announced that he Was
saved and would sin no more. Amid a
burst of clapping he wobbled back to
his savior, spoke quietly at first and then
with mounting noise and excitement until
the whole street echoed with indignant
shouts about “thievin’ cows who pinch
a man’s beer while he’s giving ’em a bit
of a hand.” He got his bottles and
moved on, a picture of righteous indig-
nation.

“X.S.”: Gandhi’s cremation rigorously
followed ancient custom. There have
been similar ceremonies in Australia. The
entire population of Ballarat turned out
15 years ago to see the immolation of
Casa Singh, a humble hawker. Three
tons of firewood were piled on Ballarat
common, the body reverently placed
upon it, another three tons piled upon
the shrunken figure, and, while a priest
chanted incantations, a match was applied
to the pyre in the presence of the city
health officer. Soon all was reduced to
ashes, which were then well mixed with
shovels. A portion was collected and, in
the absence of a sacred river, scattered
on the yellow surface of a farmer’s dam.

“Bo”: One of those innumerable
Soviet writers who are prodded by a
deep respect for thermal lead into
vivid propaganda for the Workers’
Paradise has, as a prelude to a prophecy
that Moscow will soon launch a rocket-
ship to Mars, averred that “the heavenly
body which tore a gigantic hole in the
earth’s crest in Siberia on June 30, 1908,
was a uranium-propelled spaceship
manned by Martians.” Unaccountably
he fails to make the claim that a Famous
Soviet Scientist had carefully removed
the hole to his laboratory and there dis-
covered the perfectly-preserved bodies of
the Martians and the secret of their
method of spaceship propulsion. But the
writer has stuck his neck out, and shortly
he should be sitting on a spiked chair,
directly under a 1000-c.p. light while the
N.K.V.D. closely questions him on two
vital points, viz.: (1) Mention of a
“heavenly” body presupposes the exist-
ence of a heaven, which the anti-God
philosophy of Communist Russia dis-
avows ; (2) by ascribing the discovery of
uranium to the Martians he thereby
robbed Soviet scientific workers, who
really discovered the metal, of the honor.
* * * *
“Garrick”: Brisbane’s only legitimate
theatre has closed its doors to vaudeville
and Sydney Tiv. is to go highbrow. It
is the end of another chapter in the field
of entertainment. I well remember in
Glasgow, 25 years ago, when there w|ere at
least a dozen theatres playing twice
nightly. Many a time I have enjoyed the
“first house” at the Pavilion, then walked
a few blocks to the “second house” at the
Empire. Those artists had to work hard
for their dough; twice nightly on the
stage, matinees Wednesdays and Satur-
days, 14 shows a week. A personal
appearance was not an advertising stunt
to them —it was their bread and butter.
* * * *
“G.E.P.”: Mention of a Jerusalem
celebration by “Brolga” (B. 21 /1 / ’4B) re-
calls the binge with which Shorty, Bill
and Gordon celebrated their newly-
gazetted pips. To the horror of the cafe’s
cosmopolitan clientele, Shorty, appar-
ently grown suddenly morose under the
spell of Wog beer, placed the muzzle of
his pistol against his temple and pulled.
Though only a dull click fell on the
hushed atmosphere, Wogs scattered and
bints squealed as tables were overturned.
Only Bill and Gordon drank on in seem-
ingly callous indifference to the cobber’s
fate. Shorty’s next shot, directed sky-
wards clearly as a test, blew chunks out
of the ceiling. Thereafter his features
registered hopefulness and sheer frustra-
tion as successive trigger-pulls produced
alternately dull clicks and further ceiling
demolitions. Resignedly bolstering the
weapon Shorty walked out with his mates,
leaving the Wog proprietor to explain
things to the Redcaps.
* * * *
“Lackspear”: The attempt to prove
(B. 28/1/’4B) that the quality of good
poetry depends on the presence or
absence of adjectives failed completely,
each side quoting equally good examples.
It is not the form of a work of art but
what is put into the form which makes it
good. A university undergraduate writes
a sonnet and Shakspeare writes a sonnet
and the form may be precisely the same,
but there is a world of difference between
the two sonnets. Shakspeare put into
his a rich understanding of human
nature; the undergraduate may only
put into his the ideas of his grand-
mother. The Bard himself, incidentally,
went adjectivally mad at times, yet on
occasion he could be as hard with the
adjunct relation as a sub-editor faced with
paper-shortage.
POSTAGE-STAMP FAME.
“Three men famous in Australian life will be
commemorated in special postage-stamp issues this
year, Baron von Mueller, W. J. Farrer and Henry
Lawson, the poet.”
Here’s stirring news, you lads who sweep the
lyre
With what you fondly hope’s poetic fire,
And frequently complain your craft affords
Inadequate material rewards!
Renown more lasting than financial lures
(Even though posthumous) may yet be yours.
Now that the ice is broken, who can say
A grateful nation, on some future day
Wise to your worth, will not be moved to
clamp
Your lineaments upon a postage-stamp?
More poets’ visages may* cross the seas
With statesmen’s and explorers’ effigies,
Plus those of emus, platypuses, ’roos
And various other symbols that we choose
To boost this sunny land and advertise
The articles in which we specialise,
And show that even in these far-flung parts
We don’t neglect the rarest of the arts.
Comrades, let nought avail the hope to damp
You still may live upon a postage-stamp.
Consider Homer’s vogue! Though he’s been
dead
Three thousand years and had to beg his bread,
Tradition tells, he left the world a store
Of wealth to last three thousand years and more.
Consider Burns, who gained from verse a bare
Pittance, and now has statues everywhere.
So, courage, brother! Though the spoils be nix
From poetry, compared with politics,
And carping critics seek your style to cramp
Fame may await you—on a postage-stamp.
Stick to your job! There’s always scope for
loads
Of ballads, sonnets, triolets and odes,
And all the other forms of lilting words
Expected from a nest of singing birds.
What though your mere immediate returns
Resemble those of Homer or of Bums,
Bethink no lengthy period may pass
Before you’re up in Henry Lawson’s class
And rapt philatelists will trim their lamps
Upon your classic dial —on postage-stamps.

T. THE R.


“F.S.”: Perhaps the acoustics of Mel-
bourne City Court were responsible for
this one. “Were you on the pier?” the
P.M. asked a witness in a case of petty
thieving. The witness looked surprised,
but promptly answered: “Yes, y’wor-
ship.” “How long were you on it?”
asked the magistrate. “Well, y’worship,”
said the witness after a few moments’ con-
sideration, “I don’t know exactly, but I’d

“Zake”; Decision of the R.A.S. to
ban at Sydney’s Easter Show those side-
shows which “hold the. human body up
to ridicule” will be heartily welcomed
by the harassed father who, guided un-
erringly by the kids, has been importuned
into coughing up a bob each for his off-
spring, and himself as unwilling spectator
as well, so that for about half a minute
they could gaze popeyed on bearded and
quarter-ton ladies, pinheaded Celestials,
hard-dialled dames between the tattoo-
marks on whose epidermis it would be
impossible to put a trey bit, and the inevi-
table slab of skin-and-bone who looks as
if he might snap in two at any moment.
If the public must gaze on human freaks,
there’s a free Exhibition, with even greater
variety available, on any beach on any
Sunday.

“Macnefl”: In years of experience I’ve
found that that part of a warship’s con-
struction which puzzles visitors most is
not the bridge or guns or engine-rooms,
but the roughened surface of all between-
decks steel. Painted white, the steel has
little lumps “growing” over it like fungi.
These are pieces of cork. In tropics,
warm air condenses on the steel deck-
heads, causing sweating and rust, so
shredded cork is mixed with white flatting
and the mixture sprayed on the steel.
The cork absorbs practically the whole
of any moisture reaching it, and rust in a
warship’s ’tween-decks is well-nigh non-
existent.

Did Sawbones was right after all? “Take
it easy on your work, cut out smoking,

Dottle of medicine he’d given me—take
a quart of it! Holidays? Six months at
least. But my resolutions came too late ;
the warrior was making a quick move-
ment with his right hand towards his
shoulder where Claudius tells us they
used to keep a second dagger. Then he
spoke; Got a match, mate?” I opened
my eyes, looked at the cork-tipped gasper
in his mouth, and eagerly begged him to
keep the full box. Later, as I passed the
Little Theatre I saw the notices announc-
ing “Julius Cossar.” Old Sawbones’ medi-
cine? Poured it down the sink.

“Fons”: One thing about women: they
can be economical. I had the pleasure
of inspecting a young one recently,
gowned for dining out in a dazzling
affair of white something-or-other and
black—a really magnificent creation, all
sweeping skirts and gracious rustlings.
The wearer informed me that she copied
the design from a shop-window, the price
of the original being 22 guineas. Cost to
my friend: a few days’ work and £2.
. Which proves also, of course, that women
are pot all economical, and that there
must be a fair profit somewhere along
the chain of gown-providing.

“Dong”; Coming over to our dividing-
fence, my neighbor beamed in triumph.
“I’ve done it,” he said. “Scored off old
Greenfingers on the other side. Every
summer he waits until his garden is roar-
ing with color and then, very patronis-
ingly, comes in and tells me how I can
do the same. He made his appearance
last night, and caught me tying up
my dahlias —naturally I had been
doing it wrongly, and had the stakes to
leeward instead of windward. But I think
it’ll be his last visit. He spotted something
growing at the back of the dahlias.
Highly excited, he told me that this was
a Rigor delecti (or something)—a rare
and beautiful dahlia. I had to tell him
that it was actually a spud that had
sprouted from some potato-peeling
humus.”

“Philp”: “Hic’s” dissertation on cock-
tails (B. 4/2/ ”48} recalled a book which
I owned, more or less for display, in my
salad days. It contained the formulae for
a thousand of the beastly things, each
prescription being followed by a warning
printed in scarlet. The “Bikini” sounds
like a new name for the old “Blue
Blazer” —a concoction of two or three
spirits ignited and thrown from one con-
tainer to another until suitably mixed.
Amateurs were advised to “extinguish the
flames before drinking.” Closely follow-
ing that in potency was a devil’s brew
called “The Corpse Reviver” —one of
them was guaranteed to revive a corpse;
two to “unrevive” it. After sampling
those and one or two other recipes in the
book, I presented it to a rabbit-poisoner,

“Hello”: Renovations to the Common-
wealth Bank in Melbourne have resulted
in the ancient sign: “Exchange 1879”
over the iron gateway at the Flinders-
lane entrance being painted out. Ever
since the 70’s this inscription has re-
minded Melbournites of the site of the
city’s first Exchange, erected by Byron
Moore, of V.R.C. fame. It was over
this old sign that he built a pigeon-
loft to house birds given to him by Field-
Marshal von Moltke. They were used
to bring coursing results from Werribee.
“Curate’s Egg”: Reference by “Fons”
(B. 21 /1 / ’4B) to the hospitallity of Welsh
Rugger addicts brings poignant recollec-
tion of the first time I played for Cunna-
mulla against Charleville. In my callow
ignorance I marvelled at the size of the
crowd which rolled up to see off the
train of victorious Cunnamullites. A few
seconds later I marvelled at the accuracy
of the home team’s partisans, whose
barrage of ancient henfruit took me
amidships, whilst I cursed my team mates
for not warning me that such exchanges
are strictly de rigeur in the sporting code
of the blacksoil country. No rancor
accrues. Six weeks later I opened up for
the home team with extremely potent
ammunition when the “special” drew
out of Cunnamulla with the homing
Charlevillians. By that time I had

Bybren”: “Uco’s” contempt for the
petty bandits whose misdeeds gain so
much publicity (B. 14/1 /’4B) is well
placed. Most of them have a yellow
streak a mile wide. My American mail
details how three escapees from
Colorado State Prison entered a home in
search for food. They left in some haste
after the lady of the house had floored
one with a claw-hammer. From the
opposite side of the Atlantic, however,
comes news of a housebreaker who rang
for the police and awaited their arrival
when his mate fell from a ladder and
fractured a leg while they were engaged
in their unlawful pursuits. This charit-
able act cost him 21 months. Just one
of those annoying inconsistencies that
prevent us from writing off all crooks' as
a dead loss.

“Currumbene” witnesses a little epic of
the sea:
At Huskisson, a little fishing-tourist town on
the N.S.W. South Coast, a Young Digger after
three years of effort built himself a 200-ton
vessel for the Islands trade and was all set
to launch her when a week’s rain came.
The launching-place was a small basin in a
creek with an entrance to the sea about 40ft.
wide and 300 ft. long. With about 25 people
aboard the boat was launched, and the moment
she hit the water a five-foot-high flood swept
down the reach, picked her up like a cork,
snapped every line and shot her through that
entrance Uke a bullet. Luckily she went
straight through had she got across the
channel she’d have been smashed to bits.
Outside was a rocky coast on the south, a
reef on the north, a long and flat beach in-
side the reef, a howling southerly and huge
seas meeting the floodwaters. Fishing-trawlers
gave chase, but every line they got aboard
broke. Then seas and wind pushed her
safely ashore on the beach, and her people
came easily down ropes to the sand. There
she remained while everybody speculated as
to her fate. But her Digger owner knew his
seas. He ran a hawser 300 yards to the reef
and secured it there, dredged up a> heavy
anchor he’d remembered lying in the basin,
lashed it to his winch and dropped it 150
yards out, then waited for the full moon and
a king-tide. Both duly arrived, the winches
went to work and the boat went to sea and
was towed back into the basin.

“Ex-R.A.N.”: “Craiser’s” discussion
on how much force is required to move
a ship (B. 28/l/’48): In July, 1945,
H.M.A.S. Westralia, not long after doing
her bit in the last of the Borneo landings,
called at Lae, N.G., to pick up some long-
service Diggers for return to Australia.
The wharf to which she was secured was
of the steel-pontoon type, and a bent lug
was in danger of holing the ship’s side.
An officer called eight seamen over, and
without a great deal of effort they pushed
more than 8000 tons of Westralia far
enough from the wharf to enable a large
fender to be lowered into position be-
tween it and the ship. The officer, who
had been at sea all his life, told me that
one man, given good conditions, could
with steady pressure move the Queen
Mary,

“Sartor”: I throw down the gage to
“T. McN.” (B. 14/1 /’4B) regarding the
origin of the buttoned cuff. It was not
the “snotties” of George Ill’s Army or
Navy, but the medicos of a rather later
day, for whom the, buttoned cuff—at any
rate, as we know it—was invented.
Doctors of about 100 years ago officiated
at operations in the dressy garb of the
gentleman of the period. Cuffs which
could be undone and turned back were
the answer to the problem, and the
fashion was introduced for the benefit of
doctors only. The buttonholes were real,
and there was no thought of ornament.
As the practice grew and became uni-
versal the utility angle was lost sight of,
and soon the cheap tailors introduced the
mock hole. Real buttonholes are still
hallmarks of the best-grade trade, and I
am assured that they are still de rigeur
when the customer is a doctor. In my
own experience of the finest tailoring
Australia ever knew—l learned its secrets
under the late Southwell Coultas, of mag-
nificent memory coatmakers were
allotted time and paid extra money for
properly-buttoned cuffs.

“Jasby”: As I sat down at the table in
a Sydney hash-house I noticed the bloke
opposite me staring gloomily at his plate.
A waitress walked by and he hailed her
with, “Could you give me a ticket,
please?” Not sensing his mood, she tried
to be skittish, or laundry-
ticket?” she wisecracked. He burst forth
in fury: “NO! A cold-pie-ticket and a
pot-of-weak-tea-ticket.” She handed him
his chit in a split-second ; it took me less
time still to change my mind to sand-
wiches and coffee.

“Taswegian”: “Clooter’s” new tele-
phone gadget (B. 14/-1 /*4B) would suit
an acquaintance of mine down to the
ground. He has a “factory line” and
a city phone on his desk, and when you
visit him you can almost hear him pray-
ing for both phones to ring, so that he
can do his “American Big Businessman”
trick of holding two conversations at
once. One day I went in to get an order
signed, and he had the two phones on
the go. He raised his eyebrows at me,
barked into one phone and then into the
other. I put the order-book in front of
him and thought “got you stumped this
time.” But no. He tucked the handset
‘ between his chin and his collarbone,
gabbled carefully into the mouthpiece,
and signed my order with his free hand.
On second thoughts, perhaps, he doesn't
need the gadget after all.

“The Husks”: I read “Jasby’s” par (B.
4/2/’4B), on the joys of being housebound
at the seaside during a week of drenching
rains with a missus and kids to entertain,
with tears of sympathy. The wireless
in our cabin uttered seven words when we
arrived and lapsed into an apparently
eternal silence which no manipulation or
adjustment could disturb. Worse, the
newspaper-cut was operating, and in spare
moments between deluges we went about
the township begging old copies from
permanent residents. But there was/ a set
of dominoes, and the missus had had the
forethought to take a pack of broads and
a crib-board, both games filling in the
time between meals. The effect was
apparent on the first fine day when the
elder boy, trying for flathead, excitedly
jerked his line. “What you got?” I asked.
“Fifteen two and a bob-tailed flush,” he
answered bitterly. Thirty hours later
\l\ million sandflies swooped on us and
after a siege of three days we capitulated
and returned to the city.

“Mark Heim”: There is a mention of
Maud Gonne (B. 28 /1 /’4B) in ]Mary
Colum’s just-published Life and the
Dream. It tells how one night W. B.
Yeats appeared at the Abbey Theatre in
Dublin accompanied not as usual by
Lady Gregory but by a tall, beautiful
woman aureoled with bright bronze hair.
It was Maud Gonne, who had just
divorced Major Mcßride. The audience
in the pit hissed her because of the
divorce. Says Mary Colum:
The woman stood and faced the hissers
—the most beautiful, the most heroic-
looking being I have ever seen. She was
about six feet tall and of both romantic
and commanding presence. Her height
would have drawn attention anywhere, but
it was her beauty that produced the most
startling effect. It was startling in its
greatness, its dignity, its strangeness.
Whether Yeats lost his heart to her or
not he certainly wrote love poems about
her.
LEAP YEAR.
Five February Sundays, eh?
Before the current month is past.
How many, d’you suppose, could say
Exactly when this happened last
Or when it will occur again?
Still it should serve, unless you’re sleepier
Than most, to fix it in your brain
That Nineteen-Forty-Eight is Leap Year.
Once there were two full moons, I’ve read,
In this same month, on some glad morn
When Queen Victoria’s girlish head
Was crowned, and poet Swinburne born.
But there’s some error here, I fear,
Some mixed-up dates you can’t ignore,
Since Eighteen-Thirty-Seven, it’s clear,
Is not divisible by four.
But never mind the almanacks.
The point to which I would allude
Is here’s the year girls may relax
Their legendary attitude
Of waiting to be wooed and won
And by prescriptive right beginning
The task of concentrating on
Their own technique of woo-and-winning.
Beware, you bold, flirtatious beaux
Of roving eyes and fleeting fancies!
Watch out, you gay Lotharios,
Before you take tco many chances
With honeyed nothings, lightly weighed,
To whisper in the far from sleepy ear
Of some accommodating maid,
Keep it in mind that this is Leap Year!

On the demand side, the outlook for
cement is one of steady pressure for some
time ahead. The heavier consumers of
the stuff—large-scale public works, and
factory, office and flat buildings—are not
at the head of the list of building
priorities. Until the slack in home-
building is taken up, large-scale resump-
tion of other forms of building and con-
struction will be retarded. To what extent
the profits of producers will eventually
benefit, if at all, depends largely upon
movements in selling prices, which are
controlled by official edict, and upon
costs, which are being forced rapidly up-
wards by organised labor’s more-pay-for-
less-work policy and industrial hold-ups,
both made possible by the general
economic position, which is one of
scarcity.
What has happened in the Portland
cement and cement-goods industries can
be seen in the following table, compiled
from statistics published by the Common-
wealth Statistician:
Av. Monthly , —>-Value Production

+ Portland cement only.
* Portland cement and cement goods.
Although figures in the last two columns
cover cement-goods as well as Portland
cement, they indicate the overall trend,
which might not be quite so marked in
the case of Portland cement alone. Be-
cause the gain from expanding produc-
tion has been unable to keep pace with
the heavy increase in outgo, owing to
wage lifts, etc., ss. was added to the sell-
ing price of cement last term, making the
lift 12s. 9d. since war began. And the
trend, which would be more marked still
but for the subsidy on coal, will be
further accentuated by introduction of the
40-hour week from the beginning of 1948.
Australian Cement (paid capital
£760,433) is financially an investment
concern, being an equal partner with
Kandos Cement (paid capital £673,862)
in Australian Portland Cement Pty.
(paid capital £2,000,000), largest producer
in Australia. The operating co.’s two
plants have a combined capacity of some
500.000 tons cement p.a.—the one at
Kandos (N.S.W.) 200,000 and the other
at Fyansford (Vic.) 300,000 tons. It has
been decided to lift capacity at Fyansford
by another 60,000 tons p.a., and, because
plant for overseas would cost more and
take longer to deliver and install, orders
have been placed locally for the necessary
equipment. Shareholders in the holding
cos. will not be asked to assist. Apart
from its holding in the operating co.,
over whose figures the curtain is kept
drawn, Australian Cement’s only other
assets at end November last were £140,742
in Government securities and cash, and
£3750 in shares in Bates (A/sia) Pty.,
which makes the paper-bags the cement
is packed in.
Although production increased last
term, shortage of black coal kept the
operating co.’s aggregate output about
70.000 tons below what it should have
been. And, since tests have shown that
cement cannot be economically manu-
factured with brown coal, there appears
no way in which the co. can sidestep the
problem of black coal, which is one of
adequate and regular supply. The opera-
ting co. has paid 6 p.c. for each of the
last five years as against 9 p.c. before
that, thus enabling Australian Cement to
pay 8 p.c. compared with 12£ p.c, for
the four years to 1941.
The market prices of the two holding
cos.’ shares, and the yields therefrom,
etc., compare as follows:

tralian Cement.

This co.’s history largely reflects the
ups and downs of the international meat-
trade, The old Q.M.E, was split in twain
in 1915, when the pastoral properties
passed to Australian Stock Breeders and
the meatworks (at Townsville and Bris-
bane) to the present co. For the first
five years shareholders averaged 5.8 p.c.,
thanks to war-time contracts.
For the next 11 years they got two divs.,
totalling 9 p.c,, and reserves were tapped
for £BO,BOl to pay them and extinguish
trading losses. That was because Argen-
tina got a stranglehold on British and
Continental markets with chilled and
baby beef, while locally droughts, labor
troubles and wage-lifts bumped up costs.
Still, owing to allowances for deprecia-
tion, etc., the board was able to hang on
to more money than it could find use for
in the business, and ss. a share
(£163,744) was returned in 1933, reducing
paid capital to its present figure
(£491,232 in 15s. shares).
The turning-point came about the mid-
-1930’5, when Britain withdrew restrictions
on Australian chilled, while maintaining
levies and quantitative Controls on ship-
ments from the Argentine. At the same
time the co. spent about £45,000 on its
Townsville works, mainly on account of
chilling. For the four years to 1935 a
regular 2\ p.c. was paid, followed by 4, 6
and 4 p.c., making an average of 3.7 p.c,
for the seven years to 1938. For the next
half-dozen war years demand was stif-
fened by Service contracts, seasons were
good, and shareholders received a steady
7 p.c. Then drought and a State-wide
strike of meatworkers affected the 1945
and 1946 figures, and the div. dropped to
5 p.c. and 2 p.c. respectively.
Operations were uninterrupted last
term, though much of the stock treated
was in poor condition. Still, prices were
firm, thanks to the British beef contract,
under which the Commonwealth Govern-
ment deducts 1 p.c, of the purchase price
for administrative purposes; and tallow
fetched more, though it is still well below
U.K. values. The meat cos. and growers
continue to press for an adjustment of
official prices for hides and removal of
control.
After allowing £7392 (down £226) for
depreciation and whatever was considered
necessary for taxation and other contin-
gencies, the board wrote net earnings at
£30,815 (up £20,027), or 6.2 p.c. on
capital. But that included an overdue
interest payment of £9475 on advances
made to Australian Stock Breeders “some
years ago.” The £21,340 profit derived
from the year’s operations was 4.3 p.c. on
capital as against 2.1, 4.7, 7.1, 7, 7.1, 6.7,
6.9 and 7 p.c. back to 1939. The div. was
lifted from 2 p.c. to 6 p.c., of which
1 p.c. was labelled bonus.
Apart from seasonal conditions (satis-
factory at the moment) and costs (still on
the up-grade), what the future holds for
the industry depends largely upon what
happens when the present meat-export
contract with U.K. runs out in September
next. In the absence of a new agreement
—an unlikely contingency at the moment
—prices would fluctuate considerably
under open - market competition. In
Britain, which remains the chief outlet
for Australian meat, the policy is to in-
crease home-grown supplies, and the out-
put capacity of works in both Argentina
and Maoriland expanded during the war
years. These points need to be taken
into account when considering the co. s
long-term prospects. Meanwhile, the
Federal Government should allow the
co. to turn attention to Malaya, where an
offshoot, Singapore Cold Storage Co., is
making “good progress.”
Reconstruction of the co.’s Australian
works is now well on the way. Last term
£27,607 more than was written off was
spent on fixed assets:

The prospect of Austin cars coming for-
ward in better quantity and in types suited
to the Australian market has had a
notable influence on quotations for the
Victorian agent, Austin Distributors, Ltd.
(B. 28 /1 / ’4B), and is doubtless one factor
in the rising quotes for York Motors,
Ltd., which operates the Queensland
franchise through a subsidiary. In the
case of Larke Hoskins, the N. S. Wales
agent —its franchise excludes portion of
the Riverina and portion of the Northern
Rivers areas —the influence has been
somewhat less pronounced. Buyers
offered 31s. 6d. shortly after the ords.
were officially listed last July and have
now raised their bids to 345. Sellers,
who demanded 375. 6d. in August,
haven’t since put in an appearance on
’Change.
Bodybuilding is now the main bottle-
neck so far as sales of British cars are
concerned. In leased premises- at Cam-
perdown (Sydney), Larke Hoskins runs
its own modern assembly-line and body-
building workshops for Austin tourers
and utilities, and has hitherto depended
on the Melbourne co., Ruskin Motor
Bodies, Ltd., for saloon bodies only.
These are expected in better supply
shortly in view of the reorganisation be-
ing carried out by Ruskin’s new manage-
ment, and it is possible that Larke
Hoskins’s own output will benefit from
closer contact with the English Austin co.
Larke Hoskins also conducts a repair
and servicing business in freehold pro-
perty at East Sydney, and has show-
rooms in William-street. A dearth of
new cars during the war years left repair
work as the co.’s main breadwinner, sup-
plemented by some barely remunerative
munitions contracts. A prospectus issued
last year showed net profits for 1944 and
1945 at £14,028 and £13,047 —represent-
ing a very satisfactory annual average of
23 p.c. on capital. Dividends were 101
p.c. and 10 p.c. respectively. The un-
explained relapse in profits for 1946 still
allowed a comfortable margin above the
10 p.c. div. The distribution was raised
to 15 p.c, last year, when profit improved
by £11,748 and represented over 30 p.c.
on mean capital employed. Depreciation
allowance was £7OOO compared with £lB6O
in 1946 ; tax provisions aren’t specified,
but the last accounts appeared before the
announcement that War-time (Co.) Tax
was abolished, and presumably made
considerable allowance, now rendered un-
necessary, for that impost.
As in the case of Austin Distributors,
the co. is in a good position to improve
its earnings, but later it will face a more
competitive market. The £1 ords. have

For the period covered by the table
profits were derived entirely from the
holding in Pato Consolidated, one of
the co.’s big dredging interests in
Colombia (S. America). Profits are
written after payment of taxation, and
after charging portion of the year’s ex-
penditure ($35,238, down $5277 last term)
to property-inspection account, the bal-
ance of which is charged to reserves. In-
come from other sources ($60,570 last
term) has been credited to the inspection
account.

Bulolo and Asnazu are expected to be
back on the dividend list again about the
end of 1948. Interest centres chiefly in
the S. American holdings, recently
strengthened by formation of Nechi, and
in American Placers, a wholly-owned
subsidiary now testing likely oil-bearing
ground in Texas (U.S.). The other in-
terests promise to be small but welcome
contributors to the pool.
Bulolo, a handsome contributor pre-
war, is in production again. From
Feb. 20 to end May, 1947, two dredges
dug 720,000 c.y. for 13,5590 z. fine gold.
Gravel reserves at end May were
149.000. c.y., of which 128,000,000 c.y.

A drop of 5.9 cents a yard in
average value of ground treated
last term (22.21 cents) was prac-
tically offset by a saving of
5 cents in working costs (12.6
cents). The div. was lifted from
35 p.c, to 40 p.c. Since the close
of accounts the dredges have
been handling 31.69-cent ground.
This is well above mine average,
and augurs well for the current
year’s earnings. At end April
last gravel reserves were;

Future costs and the world
price of gold will determine
whether marginal ground can be
worked at a profit. Another
dredge, fabricated in U.S., is ex-
pected to be in operation towards
end 1948. A further deep-
dredging machine has yet to be
constructed.
Asnazu paid its last div.
(5 p.c.) in 1943, since when net
earnings have been used to re-
duce the debt to Placer and
Oroville Gold Dredging, which
was about $lOO,OOO when the
books closed. This is expected
to be wiped out during the
current term, after which moder-
ate divs. can be expected. At
end April last gravel reserves
were 51,000,000 c.y,, averaging
16.67 cents,
Nechi Consolidated was re-
cently registered in Canada to
take over and work some
124,000 acres of gravel adjoin-
ing Pato downstream on the
Nechi River. Paid capital is
$5,000,000, of which Placer
owns $2,580,000, and Oroville
most of the balance. At Sept, 1
last 186,000,000 c.y., averaging
16.5 cents (U.S.), had been
proved, and there was another
100,000,000 c.y., averaging
about 14.5 cents, partly de-
veloped the proved area
exceeds original expectations.
A second-hand 4,000,000-c.y.-
p.a. dredge was recently bought
m U.S., and is expected to be
installed and operating by end
1948. It was originally in-
tended to equip the property
with two big machines, together
to handle 12,000,000 c.y. annu-
ally. On this basis estimated
profit, before allowing for de-
preciation, was $BOO,OOO p.a., or
16 p.c. on capital.
American Placers (paid capital
$634,000) recently acquired a
five-eighth interest in 1295 acres
of likely oil-bearing ground in
Texas (U.S.). Wells drilled not
more than a mile away on the
Ellenburger formation, which is
believed to pass under the
ground just referred to, are
“highly productive.” Only the
drill is the final arbiter as to
where the stuff is. A start is to
be made with test-boring any
time now, and the oil-bearing
stratum expected to be met with
at about 8000 ft. some 60 days
after commencement of drilling.
American Placers is also in-
terested in Canadian Explora
tion, another prospecting and de-
velopment concern which is
profitably working a wolfram
mine in British Columbia
(Canada), and in a number of
commercial and other ventures.
The parent co.’s two Austra
lian interests, which are treating
dumps on the Bendigo field
(Vic.), have started up again,
and are back on the dividend
list —in May last Rutherglen
paid 15 p.c. and Gold Dumps
2\ p.c. Rutherglen has a couple
of years’ work ahead, and Gold
Dumps at least five years’.
On Sydney ’Change Placer’s
$1 shares fetched £lO 10s. last
week, equal to $33.6 in Canadian
currency, at which figure the
immediate return is 1.5 p.c. on
a 50 p.c. div. basis, or 3 p.c. on
a 100 p.c. distribution. Market
value of the undertaking at the
price just mentioned is
$26,528,712, or 33.6 times paid
capital. Obviously the market
likes the co.’s oil prospects.

Wages and Output
The Attlee socialists, by ironi-
cal circumstance, have been
forced to take stock of a deterio-
rating wage-price situation not
from any action deliberately
aimed by the free-enterprise
United States, but by the
move of the French Gov-
ernment, which devalued the
franc and established a free
gold and currency market within
the Republic, It is feared in
Britain that France will be able
to undersell British goods in
overseas markets, and at the
same time, through its “free”
market, will bring about a re-
patriation of sterling in payment
for British exports to countries
from which “hard” currencies
were expected. The French
Government has apparently
promised to co-operate with
Britain in order to prevent un-
due dealings in sterling; but
London financial and industrial
authorities seem to be worried
just the same.
Stafford Cripps, on February
7, warned Britain that only the
declining gold reserves of the
sterling area stood between the
country and calamity. He said
that rises in general personal
income would mean “very x*eal
disaster.”
On Wednesday of last week a
White Paper was issued declar-
ing it essential that there should
be no further general increases
in the level of British personal
incomes without a correspond-
ing growth in the volume of
production. “Under present
conditions and until more goods
and services are available for
the home market, there is po
justification for a general in-
crease in individual money in-
comes,” it added. It threw the
onus on employers to see that
inflation in wages unaccom-
panied by increased production
did not occur, Mr. Attlee ex-
plaining to the Commons that
“any employer granting wage-
increaseS, whether voluntarily
or through strikes, would have to
meet the increases from his own
resources,” Government subsi-
dies or price-rises being, ap-
parently, “out.”
Britain has thus arrived at a
crisis in its affairs more rapidly
than was expected. No Aus-
tralian, or even American, Gov-
ernment has dared to put wage-
rates upon a production basis,
even though “pegging” was
common in most Allied coun-
tries during, and for some time
after, the war. It is feared in
Britain, quite correctly, that
further inflation in wages with-
out a corresponding output per
man-hour will force sterling off
its parity with the dollar and
bring reactions and complica-
tions that will make Budget-
balancing difficult, increase
British living costs, shake con-
fidence in British financial
stability and force readjustments
of the Empire exchanges. The
Bretton Woods Agreement and
all the work that went before it
might come to nothing.
In any case, a better living
standard in Britain, as elsewhere,
can only come from increased
output per man-hour.
Britain has thrown the
responsibility where it princi-
pally belongs—right into the
teeth of the trade-unions. British
unionists are not so well-fed as
their Australian opposite num-
bers', but they have been led up
the garden path almost as much
by their “leaders.” It is entirely
true that trade-unionism in
Britain, as elsewhere, has not
been as productive as it could
have been in post-war years, and
it has been loath to admit that
its own welfare depended more
than anything else upon its own
productive efforts. The posi-
tion has perhaps been obscured
in Britain by the fact that so
much home production has to
be exported in order to buy food
and raw materials, and that it
might take 12 months before
the domestic benefits of higher
production would become ob-
vious to the British wage-earner.
But, judging by the almost des-
perate stand taken by Mr.
Attlee in the Commons last
week —he admitted that the
matter in the White Paper had
not been submitted to the Trade
Union Congress —the British
wage-earner is being called upon
to appreciate a lot about eco-
nomics in a short time.
The governor of the Com-
monwealth Bank has already
said much the saipe thing about
conditions in Australia, but
Prime Minister Chifley has not
acknowledged his warning in
any way. Said Mr. Armitage:
“The important thing is clearly
to increase production, in terms,
of quantities of goods, more
than incomes are increased.
This means, broadly, that the
problem is not only, or perhaps
even mainly, one of greater
aggregate production, but also of
greater production per man-
hour.” Instead of taking heed
of this warning, issued on Sep-
femb'er 3, 1947, the Common-
wealth has adopted a general
40-hour week since January 1,
me oasxc wage rose on February
1, there have been a series of
strikes already in the new year
and Broken Hill Proprietary,
manufacturer of the steel essen-
tial to almost all other forms of
production, has told us that it is
unable to work its plant at more
than 60 p.c. of productive
capacity because of the shortage
of coal. Chifley, the reputed
economist in the Labor party,
is of a very political variety.
Neon Signs
A frank review by the new
board of Neon Signs (A/sia),
Ltd., makes it clear that even in
the absence of war conditions
the co. would have been in
serious difficulties after 1938. In
the formative first seven years
“How much are the hacksaws ?”
of the co.’s lift, 86 p.c. of profits
had been distributed, and while
paid capital had risen from
£2OOO to £lOO,OOO, reserves had
reached only £3760.
But the prospectus of the new
pref. ; issue throws additional
light on the internal financial
structure: —-
At one stage directors had to accept
real estate as part-consideration on
the allotment of shares, and this con-
stituted a frozen asset in a business
requiring liquidity of funds. Hie
increases of capital demanded higher
net profits, the earning of which in-
volved sales expansion—which in turn
required further liquid funds. To
provide these, borrowing was re-
sorted to and at high interest rates.
In fact, by 1938 the co. owed
£44,455, on which interest was
being paid at rates “varying up
to 12£ p.c. and even higher.” In
1939 loan repayments were
calling for “more than £lOOO per
month of revenue.” In that
year the co. failed to show a
profit—the least surprising aspect
of the whole affair. Losses be-
tween 1939 and 1942 totalled
£18,610, besides which £22,804
had to be written-off debts and
other assets following dislocation
of the rental business in war-
time. Following changes on the
board in 1942, profits have been
declared at steadily improving
rates —last term’s £5420 repre-
sented 5.4 p.c. on the £lOO,OOO
of capital —and the deficit has
been reduced from £37,654 to
£15,995.
The board was again recon-
structed last year and now com-
prises W. D. Sykes (chairman),
F. E. Headlam and C, C.
Henrys. They sponsor the pros-
pectus put out in respect of the
issue to present shareholders of
50,000 £1 5 p.c. cumulative
prefs.—the new funds being re-
quired to shake-off the remain-
ing high-interest debts and to
provide more working capital.
The £1 ords. (net asset back-
ing 16s. 3d.) have risen on
’Change from 12s. 9d. a year ago
to around par. Though no divs.
have been paid since 1938, the
board gave “serious considera-
tion” to a payment last tenn,
being “fully appreciative of the
necessity of having the co. re-
turn to the dividend list.”
The refusal of Capital Issues
Control to allow Henry Jones
Co-op., fruit-canners and jam- (
makers, to arrange a new issue
of shares was a shock to the'
investing public last week. The
co. is asking for an explanation ;
it is 20 years since a cash issue
of capital was made, and the
present intention is to erect a
new factory in Perth, complet-
ing a chain of manufacturing
plants in all capital cities of the
Commonwealth. Last year the
co. earned almost as much from
its overseas subsidiaries (in New
Zealand, South Africa and
Britain) as it did in Australia.
It is an efficiently-run concern,
carrying on in spite of rising
costs and shortage of sugar and
tinplate. At the co.’s annual
meeting chairman Palfreyman
said, “As one of the founders of
H. Jones and Co. 58 years ago,
I am bound to say that if it had
not been for the friendly en-
couragement, the excellent
advice and guidance and the
most generous financial assist-
ance which we received from
our private bankers, there would
not be in existence the public
company of Henry Jones Co-
operative, Ltd.”

In reading politico-economic
news from the United States,
Australians should remember
that standards for comparison
and criticism are not always the
same as in this country.
Although price-control once ex-
isted, there was never any
“profits-control” as practised in
the Commonwealth, and in 1946
all U.S. price-control was aban-
doned. One result of the dif-
ference between Australian and
U.S. methods has been that
earnings of public companies in
America have swollen to several
times their pre-war size, whereas
in Australia, for most of the
war period, profits fell away,
and now have barely recovered
their pre-war level; which means
that, in terms of depreciated
buying-power, there has actually
been a big fall. Taxation rates
in the United States have never
been as high as those in force in
this country ; U.S. excess-profits
tax was dispensed with soon
after the end of the war, whereas
in Australia it was only last year
that what was known as war-
time (company) tax was elimi-
nated, and not a great deal was
involved in the Treasury’s con-
cession. War-time rates of
company-tax otherwise remain
unchanged in the Common-
wealth.

Bullock wagons were a common sight in Sydney
when the Bank of New South Wales started
business in 1817.
To-day, bullock wagons are outmoded. Their
appearance in George Street, Sydney, would cause
a sensation.
The development of transport is one aspect of
the economic growth of Australia a growth
which has been fostered more by the Bank of
New South Wales than by any other single
Australian institution.

Money in Maoriland
Money in New Zealand has
been snowballing at the rate of
nearly two millions a month
since Bank of N.Z. finances were
dubbed “extremely liquid”
nearly 10 months ago. In the
increase are bank and savings-
bank deposits and national sav-
ings, but not hoards in old
socks, under carpets, in ward-
robes or in other hidden places.
The inflationary spree has
gone on unabated against
warnings, credit controls and
rather half-hearted consumer
resistance to soaring prices and
costs. Government aud Re-
serve Bank efforts may be build-
ing a barrier against the flood,
but the effects aren’t visible yet.
Perhaps the change will come
w'hen companies, which have
been reshaping plans, begin dip-
ping deeply for funds in non-
banking channels.
The turn of the tide shouldn’t
be far off now. In a New Year
statement. Reserve Bank heads
told Maorilanders that the trad-
ing banks were doing their part
to tighten the rein on credit
under controls which were firm
but fair. Speculative demands
were under complete ban, but
business and industry were still
getting help if they were en-
titled to it and couldn’t get it
elsewhere. There was just this
little difference: that, instead of
finding bank credit the easiest
way, they would now find it
hardest. All outside sources
must be tried first, with three
exceptions—funds to buy raw
materials or stock-in-trade or
pay working expenses, which
didn’t come under control.
To Maorilanders sensitive
about State prying into their
affairs, the Reserve Bank gave
soothing assurance that names
of applicants for credit were
never divulged by bankers while
applications were going through
the mill. London knight Sydney
Parkes, chairman of National
Bank of N.Z., on a visit to
Maoriland, praised the Gov-
ernment’s credit control as “wise
and effective,” and handed a
bouquet to the Reserve Bank,
too For the banks, he claimed
they were loyally carrying out
directions from higher up, and
were satisfied with results so
far. This seemed the complete
answer to critics, and generous
back-slapping all round fol-
lowed, but knight Parkes wasn’t
so complimentary in his refer-
ences to M.L.’s “luxury 40-hour
week” and Maorilanders’ atti-
tude to work.
Buoyant export trade inspires
Maorilanders, like Australians,
with supreme confidence in the
strength of their pound. If it
moves—the majority would pre-
fer to see it stay pat —they know
it will be towards sterling, per-
haps back to parity. They base
;he faith (1) on M.L. exports,
the highest per capita in the
world, and nearly double Aus-
tralian on a population basis.
with a target for this production
season (ending June) of
£136 million; (2) on buoyancy
of exchange funds held in Lon-
don, now building up again after
some big dips to pay off debts
to John Bull and make a splash
in import purchases; and (3) on
shrinkage in the debt-burden on
M.L.’s broadening back. When
a further £NZ24 million owing
to John Bull is wiped off in
March, M.L.’s debt in London
will be down to £67 million
sterling (excluding £3O million
1914-J8 funded war debt) and
less than half the total when the
war ended.
Sums paid off in two years
will then total £71,842,000 ster-
ling. This debt-extinction drive
eclipses all borrowing efforts,
even in M.L.’s most prodigal
days. Maorilanders haven’t
forgotten yet that the solid core
of debt which swallowed nearly
half the income from exports in
the depths of the depression in
the ’thirties just about put them
in Queer-street, financially, and
they’re determined not to risk a
repetition. Exchange funds of
about £NZBO million (includ-
ing amounts in trading banks’
hands) should be a safe margin
meanwhile, with likelihood of a
good build-up later this year.
It is a handy-looking nest-egg in
days when currencies are wob-
bling.
Great industrial activity seems
to be “on” for Port Kembla
(N.S.W.), site of Australian Iron
and Steel’s big steel-producing
plant, with galvanised-iron,
sheet-steel and many other im-
portant iron-and-isteel process-
ing factories close by. Most, in-
cluding A.I. and S. itself, are
B.H.P. affiliations. Now a
tinplate mill is expected to be
established by 8.H.P., involv-
ing heavy outlay and calling for
many more employees. A big
housing programme is planned
for Port Kembla, and the brick
and firebrick concerns in the
Illawarra area, as well as most
other businesses, appear to be
in for an expansive period. As
the Yampi (W.A.) deposits are
developed a greater quantity of
iron-ore will be flowing into
Kembla and Newcastle, and, if
Communism and trade-union •
anarchy are beaten, the founda-
tion fior widespread construc-
tional activity, factory expan-
sion and transport extension
throughout the Commonwealth
seem to be in the process of be-
ing laid right now.

Wool is putting in its strong-
est challenge yet in rivalry with
dairy produce for premier place
among Maoriland exports. Last
season it ran a fairly close
second with a total 6 f
£32,879,000 (year ended June),
against £36,571,000 for butter,
cheese and casein combined;
and this season it’s likely to top
£4O million if prices hold pre-
sent levels. Will this be enough
to outdo the dairy group?
Dairymen don’t think so, for
John Bull is paying Maoriland
255. a cwt. more for butter
under the new two-year bulk-
marketing dairy contract signed
in London a few months ago.
This means an extra million in
every eight, on top of which a
bumper season is lifting M.L.
butter outputs by 10 to 20 per
cent, in all districts. With yields
hitting ceiling levels and prices
the best since World War I, when
M.L. farmers netted half-a-
crown a pound for butter, there
might be an extra £lO million
in 1947-48 payouts. The £46
million target looks safe against
all challengers. Last year’s wool
cheque beat 1946 by £12,236,000,
as shipments bounded by 344,000
bales to 1,268,000, an all-time
M.L. record, and average prices
were a fraction over l£d. per
pound better, reaching 19.1 d.,
to draw a lot of wool from war-
time stocks. World hunger for
wool is adding a few pence a
pound more to prices this sea-
son, but this won’t be more than
wool needs to hold second place
on M.L.’s export ladder.

After a battle of years to win
over the Price Tribunal and the
Stabilisation Committee, Maori-
land’s shoe - repairers have
secured a. 12j p.c. rise in repair
prices. Compare this with 20 p.c.
proposed in New South Wales.
M.L. has had the 40-hour week
for nearly seven years since
the 1940 price-order, but £2 a
week extra wages, 16i p.c. more
for leather, and 50 to 200 p.c. for
grindery and machinery swelled
costs before officialdom would
budge. Price-contfol in M.L. is
a mixture of delaying tactics, de-
moralisation and playing into
the hands of strong groups. Re-
pairers weren’t fully organised—
many outside federation ranks
derided its earlier vain efforts to
get r.edress —and were mostly
small and scattered. Now the
battle’s won the outsiders wilj
be looking for seats in the stalls
and won’t be last in adding on
the 12j p.c. they didn’t fight to
get.

SUNDRY SHOWS
THE "GAUGUIN. "
Sydney dailies have printed a
story from Paris that the French
artist Charles Camoin claims to
have painted the “Gauguin”
which hangs in the N. S. Wales
National Gallery. The painting
certainly does not look like a
Gauguin, not being a Tahitian
lady with enormous feet, but a
French “tavernkeeper”' she
looks like a washerwoman-r-
-with the peculiar chalky and.
wobbly appearance typical of
victims to the art of Matisse —
a sort of childish outline of a
painting.
Camoin, according to Sydney
“D.T.’s” story, was a student
with Matisse, so it would not
be surprising if he painted it. It
would not be surprising if it was
found to be the work of a per-
forming seal. What is, and
always has been astonishing, is
why the Gallery bought it. At
best, it would be merely one of
Gauguin’s lapses; and one of
his Tahitian pictures would
obviously have been of more in-
terest to a city visited every
high tide by the Pacific.
According to the “D.T.,” the
picture came originally from
Paul Rosenburg, an art dealer,
of New York. It was one of a
collection gathered by Basil Bur-
dett and brought to Melbourne
by Keith Murdoch, of Mel-
bourne “Herald.” The “D.T.”
brought the collection to Syd-
ney, and thus the Gallery fell for
the picture, or fell in, or, at any
rate, fell. The price paid was
£l5OO.
If the painting does turn out
to be by Camoin, the incident
may at least demonstrate to the
trustees that it is unwise to
allow the daily newspapers to
direct the policy of the National
Gallery—a fact that remains
true even if, as Rosenburg in-
sists, the crude daub is a
Gauguin.
The Wakefield
Collection.
The collection of prints,
drawings, watercolors, etc,,
bought by the British Council
with a £3OOO gift from Lord
Wakefield shortly before his
death, and intended as a kind
of itinerant shop-window for
British art and craftsmanship,
is at present resting in one of
the side-courts of the N.S.W.
National Art Gallery, As an ex-
hibition of art it is disappoint-
ing, but as a spectacle of crafts-
manship it does well enough.
There are masses of exhibits,
and the total effect is something
like being confronted with a
prodigious number of contem-
porary English novels, essays
and short-stories. As in the
bulk of modern English prose,
there is any amount of crafts-
manship, some experimentalism
and a plethora of fine meanings,
but there is nothing to take the
breath away, or even, in the
crowded setting, to catch the
eye.
In aquatints, lithography and
the like, that is hardly to be ex-
pected. But the watercolors —
judging from pictures by
Brabazon, Buckton, Clausen,
Cowem, Darwin, Dobson,
Roger Fry, Hennell, Hodgkins,
Holmes, Jowett, Lewis, Morley,
Paul Nash, Piper, Ravilious,
Rich, Roberts, Rutherston,
Spencer, Trivick and Wood —
are inferior in everything but
subtlety to the small but bril-
liant group of watercolorists
who are most truly representa-
tive of contemporary Australian
art. Yet, according to English
reports, some of the foregoing
are names to conjure with.
Of the English watercolors
Steer’s are’the most impressive,
but his “Stormy Sky, Whitstable,”
is, at best, a flashing piece of
technique with insufficient im-
pact. Of the etchings there is
Sickert’s “The Old Bedford,”
with humor and virtuosity and
a mature balance ; and Augustus
John’s “Tete Farouche,” a lightly
skilful self-portrait in which the
artist looks very woolly and
perturbed.
Another John study of a horse
and rider is competent, but de-
ficient in the character and
vitality which Lambert has
evoked in a similar study with a
like economy of line (to em-
phasise the contrast Lambert’s
Light Horse sketches are on
view in an opposite court).
“Church of San Spirito, Mes-
sina,” an etching by Frank
Brangwyn, has, within the con-
ventions of the medium, height
and some grandeur.
Charles Frederick Tunnicliffe’s
“Shorthorn Bull” is a marvel-
lously precise piece of wood-
engraving, and Edmund Blam-
pied’s drypoint, “The Meadow
Road,” has a vague and fleeting
richness.
Everything considered, how-
ever, the exhibition is not im-
pressive. Whether that is the
fault of the Council, or because
British art has temporarily fal-
len into the doldrums, is, from
this distance, difficult to say.
At Black Bull.
There are times when one has
an almost irresistible desire to
put a sock in Mr. Priestley, not,
since he has earned some place
among the articulate, as a per-
manent gag, but as a gesture
against his almost interminable
verbosity in such plays as “I
Have Been Here Before,” put on
by the Independent Theatre at
North Sydney,
The play is neither more nor
less than another sentimental
Version of the infernal triangle
—in this'case, about three people
who come one week-end to the
Black Bull Inn in Yorkshire.
One is a wealthy, worried busi-
ness man living on his nerves
and whisky and the other two
are his young wife and the
young headmaster of a school
of which the business tycoon
is a governor. The married
couple have long tired of
each other and the wife de-
cides to go off with the school-
teacher. She is temporarily dis-
suaded by the knowledge that a
train of disasters will follow
such an action —her husband
will commit suicide, his busi-
ness will be wrecked, the school
will suffer, the headmaster lose
his job and it will be impossible
for her and her lover to find
any happiness in the wreckage.
The problem is solved by the
simple expedient of the husband
deciding not to suicide, but to
accept things as they are, face
life alone and shoulder his re-
sponsibilities to his shareholders.
To disguise that simple,
almost banal, material, Mr,
Priestley engages in discursive
action, as it were. Having
cornered his characters, and his
audience, in the Black Bull, he
proceeds to discuss reincarna-
tion with the dull, dogged ten-
acity of a bar-room bore. As
a kind of circle around the tri-
angle, he introduces an old Ger-
man professor whose experi-
ments with reincarnation have
given him a foreknowledge of
the people and events at the inn.
Having come there to test his
prescience of things, he hovers
around the three tormented
characters like a cross between
a clairvoyant and a benevolent
Father Christmas.
The fact that the professor is
aware of what is to happen to
the other three and that he more
or less guides them to happier
destinies lends ho special weight
to the play or to the theory of
reincarnation. His part in the
working-out of the drama could
be, and has been, served just as
effectively by a fortune-teller
or a maiden aunt with second-
sight. All Mr. Priestley’s ver-
biage on reincarnation is based
on very shaky premises, so the
professor’s worried mien, his
direful warnings and verbose
theories about time - cycles,
spirals, treadmills and whatnot
are as significant, as enlighten-
ing and as entertaining as Aunt
’ Clara on astrology, palmistry
and teacup-reading.
It says much for the Indepen-
dents that they held the interest
of a full house with an excellent
production of the play. Atlioll
Fleming, as the businessman,
and George Simpson-Lyttle, as
host of the Black Bull, turned in
some very finely-tempered act-
ing, with Betty Duncan, as the
hostess, matching them
nicely. The romantic business
between lean Edward, as the
young wife, and Anthony Ward,
as the schoolmaster, was a little
mooky, laad, but that is as much
Mr, Priestley’s fault as theirs.
Harvey Adams, as Dr. Gortler,
was suitably worried and pro-
found and would have been
completely convincing had he
been selling anything but Mr.
Priestley’s discussion of re-
incarnation.
"Jupiter Laughs."
A. J, Cronin, like Somerset
Maugham, is a doctor-turned-
writer. The resemblance ends
there, however, and in this play,
produced by William Carr for
Melbourne National Theatre,
there is* none of the observation
of the older playwright.
Cronin tells a pretty story —
there is the usual young
physician engaged in research
work and on the eve of a great
'discovery, and there is the custo-
mary beautiful young woman
who comes into his life at the
crucial moment. In this case
she is a missionary medico from
China. She believes in him
when all the profession is against
him and sacrifices her life in an
endeavor to save his papers
when a jealous matron tries to
burn them.
There is nothing left for the
young physician to do but throw
up his life work and go to
China to save the bodies and
souls of heathen Chinese. The
plot is a very well-worn suit of
clothes out of the theatrical
wardrobe, and Cronin’s pseudo-
psychology fails to give it con-
viction. Reg Gillam and Kath-
leen Reed did their best with
the opus.
At the Films.
When they hand out this year’s
“Oscars,” Morris Carnovsky,
the psychiatrist in “Dishonored
Lady,” now showing at Sydney
Mayfair, should be a sitter for
the small-part trophy. He has
a face like a Cheshire cat play-
ing Hamlet. The film combines
a feasible study of a troubled
mind with murder and some
very interesting courtroom se-
quences, and yet, unlike its woe-
ful predecessors, it gives m*
masses of involved complexes
that have the audience checking
back on their childhoods and
wondering what incidents should
have impaired their judgment so
that now, as adults, they turn up
to see such films.
* * * *
“Burlington Bertie,” enacted
by Betty Grable, is a thought
that strains the imagination, but
it happens in “Mother Wore
Tights” at Sydney Regent.
Equally surprising are the good
performances of all concerned
from Dan Dailey, the father,
down to a couple of children,
who, by usual Hollywood stand-
ards, should be poisonous.
Combined with a number of
bright vaudeville turns and the
character-acting of a group of
human fossils who dwell in a
pleasure resort and who are
found and resuscitated by the
lively family, mother and her
tights are well worth seeing.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
Now that a somewhat bedraggled
Peace is restlessly fluttering about the
earth, and the heroic deeds that stirred
the world between 1939-45, and the very
heroes of those years themselves begin-
ning to be forgotten, it is good to be
reminded of brave. men. Especially as
we are an island country it is good to
recall the deeds and the unflinching
courage which kept the seaways open.
To countless Australians who have
travelled in the Shaw Savill liners the
little book “The Flag of the Southern
Cross” will make great appeal. This is
a record of the things the firm’s sea-
going staff achieved by their sacrifice and
courage. This shipping company alone
lost six commanders, 120 officers, 347
ratings and four members of its shore
staff through enemy action.
1 In these pages you read once again the
glorious passing of the Jervis Bay. If
it were only for that tale alone the book
becomes a treasure. Inspiration here for
that great novelist of the sea C. S. Fores-
ter. The Jervis Bay’s Captain Fogarty
Fegen, R.N., V.C., and the Swedish
Captain Sven Olander, who when night
fell slipped out of convoy and brought
his ship back to pick up survivors of the
dauntless Bay boat, are characters to stir
his heart and mind. Then there is the
untarnishible story of the Waimarama, the
Wairangi and the Empire Hope, which
sailed in convoy to the relief of Malta
in August, 1942, when Malta was being
pounded day and night by an enemy who
seemed determined to level it to the sea.
The book has only 71 pages, but they
are history brought home to Australians
by familiar names.
A very energetic business, playing piano
concertos ... . Quite apart from the
nervous strain involved in performing
with an orchestra and before a large
audience, the muscular effort alone Would
tax the physique of a strong man. But
good-looking Australian Eileen Joyce
takes it all in her stride. While the normal
practice of virtuosi is to play one con-
certo only on the same programme,
Eileen has taken to playing two—
a very exacting matter. Neverthe-
less, she shows herself to be essentially
feminine. At a recent concert at London’s
Albert Hall, Eileen changed gowns be-
concertos: and the audience
weren’t so wrapped up in their Beethoven
and Grieg that they failed to notice the
difference in her appearance. It wasn’t
the new dress that caused the astonished
murmur of reaction so much as another
change—her hair-do. This, says Eileen,
is the best way she knows of refreshing
herself.
Noreen Dangar will become Mrs.
Bertram Wright at Easter, The wedding
will be a family affair with the Dangar
fastness, Gostwyck, Uralla, as the setting.
The ceremony will be in All Saints
Church, built as a memorial to Noreen’s
father. Full-scale cocktail party in cele-
bration was hostessed last week by Mrs.
Grant Giblin (Miss Dangar’s sister) in
the Royal Sydney Golf Club.
Outgoing ships are crammed down with
passengers mostly making for England,
and thanks to our bumper wheat crop
the bread-basket of old England will
probably stand up to the strain. Out-
ward-bound travellers say virtuously:
“Of course I’m having a lot of food
parcels sent forward,” forgetting that food
parcels can only, after all, supply luxuries ;
basic foods must still come from Eng-
land’s fish, meat and grain markets. How-
ever, maybe the sterling the travellers
bring to her shores will help even things
up.
Mrs. Greg McGirr waved farewell to
sister Mrs. C. Perrott and niece Pat
Perrott, of Perth, last Sunday. The two
Westralians have been visiting Sydney,
staying at the Greg McGirr home in
North Sydney and, in spite of our mixed
weather, having a grand time. The
Perrotts are always lavishing hospitality
on Sydneyites passing through Perth, so
there was a mountain of invitations
awaiting them before they arrived within
cooee of Port Jackson.
Sydney wasn’t unduly surprised last
week when the news broke that Betty
Considine was to be married in New
York during the week-end. Betty, pretty
and fair and with a very amusing tongue,
left Australia last August in company
with equally good-looking, dark-haired
Mane Fagan, of Mandurama (N.S.W.),
on a journey that was to take in America
and maybe England. The two have had
a marvellous time, culminating with
Betty’s romance. The young man is
Lieut. - Commander William Leader
Conley, of the Navy Department, Wash-
ington.
The arrangements were: Wedding in St.
Patrick’s Cathedral, Fifth-avenue, New
York, with Colonel August Gearhard, who
was Chaplain-General in Australia with
the U.S., Air Force, blessing the vows.
Marie Fagan bridesmaid, Mrs. Light-
foot-Walker matron-of-honor, and the re-
ception at the Lightfoot-Walker Park-
avenue home. Lieut.-Commander Conley
and his bride will live in Washington,
The Australian - American Society
spread a good lunch for U.S. Task Force
38 —not the whole of the force, of course,
but officers from the Rear-Admiral down
to lieutenants were among those busy
with plates of turkey and ham. The
lunch was a buffet cut-and-come-
again function, and if you are one
of the lucky who can juggle a
plate, knife and fork and a glass at one
and the same time you stood up bravely ;
if you were a craven heart you slunk to
the sidelines, sat down and put' the im-
pedimenta on a chair beside you. The
younger members of the society had lots
of fun talking to one-stars upwards, and
the important and older talked to Rear-
Admiral Martin and other quarter-deck
notables. President of the society C. F.
Horley and Mrs. Horley received the
guests. Mrs. Florence‘Taylor, president of
the women’s group, smiled serenely on all.
Mrs. Ted Scorfield, her pale-gold hair
snooded smoothly beneath a little striped
roundabout hat, saw to many introduc-
tions. With her black frock Mrs. Maurice
Gulson wore a hat of charm, pictorial
yet demure. America’s Consul-General
Nielsen and Mrs. Nielsen were there ; so
was U.S. Consul Knowlton Hicks.

The Orion brought to our shores (for
the fourth time) Austin Innes Anderson, a
director of the Orient company. He was
bora nearly 100 years after his grand-
father, James Anderson of Peterhead,
founded the great shipping line. His
wife’s father was W. R. Lysaght, chair-
man of John Lysaght and Company. She
and their two daughters Elizabeth and
Rosemary have accompanied him on this
journey to Australia. Mr, Anderson
served in the Army in the first war, and
in the Ministry of War Transport during
the 1939-45 upheaval. First evening party
in their honor was held last week in the
Morsheads’ home at Vaueluse.
The N. S. Wales branch of the Associa-
tion for Better Hearing is resuming work
in its Bond-street clubroom and is look-
ing forward to a successful year. The
new sound-amplification-set should open
much wider fields of interest for the
members now it is possible for them to
listen to talks and play readings. The
music for the . Association’s Christmas
party was supplied through an amplifica-
tion-set lent by Mr. Greatorex, of S.T.C.
Greetings for 1948 come from
Stephanie Edye, pursuing ballet in Lon-
don, and from Elizabeth King, seeking
fame in the theatre. There’s also a card
delicately painted with snowdrops from
Australian nurse Dora Maxwell, now with
the 84th Br. Military Hospital, 8.A.0.R.,
in Berlin. Dora finds Germany very dif-
ferent from Italy, where she was previ-
ously. “Hamburg the worst, I think.
Have done a conducted tour of Berlin
today—not many places left intact....
the hospital, however, is nice and com-
fortable, seven miles out of Berlin.”
From Melbourne
There were over 1000 guests at the
farewe., reception given «o Archbishop
J. J. Booth and Mrs. Booth in St. Kilda
Town Hall prior to their departure on
the Orion for England, where the Arch-
bishop will attend the Lambeth Confer-
ence. His Excellency Sir Winston Dugan,
who made a presentation to the guest-
of-honor during the evening, was accom-
panied by Lady Dugan, whose black
satin frock was highlighted with black
tulle at the neckline, Mrs. Booth’s frock
of delphinium-blue crepe featured a small
collar and full skirt. Misses Joan, Mar-
garet and Patricia Booth were with their
parents. With the Chief Justice, Sir
Edmund Herring, was Lady Herring.
Other representative citizens included the
Lord Mayor, knight Ray Connelly, and
knights Robert Knox and William Ang-
liss and their wives.

Many committees are working hard
for the success of the War Nurses’
Memorial Centre Appeal, but the objec-
tive of £250,000 is not yet in sight. The
central committee of the appeal is con-
sidering the purchase of a city building
which would require little alteration for
use as a centre. The committee has also
approved a scheme of endowment of
special sections of the memorial centre.
It has been decided to invite donors to
give their names to library, refectory,
lounge and other rooms. The sisters at
the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital
have their own queen, Sister (“Mickey”)
Syer, an ex-p.-0.-w. Ex-members of the
A.A.N.S. everywhere are doing what
they can to raise money for the centre.
The Maffra Hospital is one of the smallest
to nominate a queen (Sister Joan Newn-
ham) in the War Nurses’ Memorial
Centre contest. Already it has raised
£375 —exes, only £s—and aims to collect
£lOOO before the contest closes in March.
The people in Maffra and neighboring
towns have been most generous; a ball
at Nambrok raised £118; the hospital
fete netted £56 ; Mrs. N. Mclnnes, mother
of one of the sisters at Maffra Hospital,
raised £22 with an afternoon tea. Mrs.
R. Baker, a member of the Geelong
branch of the appeal, decided, while
holidaying at Anglesea, to arrange dances
there. Net result: £lOO.

The “new look” was not in evidence at
Moonee Valley when the Williamstown
Racing Club held its meeting. A pleasant
day, with warm sunshine and a cool
breeze, brought racegoers out in suits
and frocks which were a forecast of
autumn styles. There were, however, few
pointers which might determine overseas
influence in coming fashions. White
ermine tails were bunched on the lapels
of one dressmaker suit; white em-
broidered blouses of the “Gibson Girl”
type had the necks cut high and finished
with a narrow frilling of lace; shoulders
of suits were slightly rounded, and the
hipline of a number of frocks also showed
the slightly-rounded line. But skirts re-
main the same length. Mrs. Theo Lewis
wore a hyacinth-blue angora frock and
matching long coat; her small black-silk
straw hat had tulle rosettes and pink rose-
buds for trimming. The sleeves and lapels
of Mrs. Harry Reed’s azure-blue angora
jacket suit were edged with cornflower-
blue angora. The tones were repeated in
her straw hat, Mrs. W. Pultney Mein,
wife of the W.R.C. chairman, was smart
in black cr£pe jacket suit and filmy white
blouse ; her small black hat carried white
flowers.
Mrs. J. Madden’s light-blue tweed suit
was worn with a navy-and-white-straw hat
and navy accessories. Maida Voigt chose
a tailored coat of frappe lime tweed, and
with it wore an otf-white panama hat.
Nan Dethridge’s London-tan-pleated
frock was allied to a small pill-box of
Hunter-green felt. Mrs. C. Curtain’s suit
was deep royal purple, its pockets and
lapels of grey Persian lamb ; her hat com-
bined purple and royal-blue straw, and
was trimmed with spiky feathers in the
same tonings. Wyn Kellow put a summer
ermine coat over her black frock; her
small black velvet cap was made on
fisher-cap lines. Over Mrs. W, Filer’s
black frock was worn a black Broadtail
coat; green - and - gold - plaid ribbon
trimmed her small upturned black straw
hat. Mrs. Ned Holland’s pale-grey shark-
skin frock cut on tailored lines and large-
brimmed black-straw hat made happy
combination. Her mother, Mrs. W. J.
Forster, wore a smart navy-tailored coat
over a floral frock ; her black hat featured
bows of deep-mauve ribbon. Mrs. A. J.
Tatnall trimmed her black hat with black-
and-white-checked taffeta ribbon, which
matched the checks of her tweed suit.
With her brown tailored suit Mrs. E.
Elkins wore one of the new berets of del-
blue straw ; the flat crown was fashioned
of cyclamen, blue and gold taffeta ribbon.
Vows were exchanged at Newman
College by Alison Mary, eldest daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. L. R. Buxton, of Arma-
dale, and Ross David, youngest son of
Mr. and Mrs. C. W. Batten, of Kew, the
rector of Newman, Rev. Father J. M.
Murphy, assisted by Rev. Father B. Lux-
ton, officiating. The bride’s white satin
gown, threaded with silver embroidery,
was fashioned with a Peter Pan collar,
long sleeves and full skirt ending in a
train. Her long veil was of white tulle,
and she carried an ivory prayer-book.
Sisters Beverley and Carolyn were brides-
maids, and with their gowns of heavy
white satin wore large picture hats of
white stiffened tulle ; their bouquets were
of gardenias. John Batten was best man
and Peter Forrest groomsman. Recep-
tion was held, at the home of the bride’s
parents. Mrs. Buxton, who with her
husband and parents of the ’groom re-
ceived the guests, chose a pearl-grey
chiffon frock which featured a full skirt
witji unpressed pleats ; her strawberry-
toned straw hat was turned off the face
and trimmed with grey satin ribbon.
Professor Bernard Heinze and Mrs.
Heinze, Mrs. Roland Dixon and her
daughters Pamela and,Nanette, who re-
cently returned from America, were
among the many guests.
A party and mannequin parade, given
by corset-company executive T. J. Dowd,
served to lay emphasis on the “new line,”
which included a model to achieve the
“nipped-in” waist. A principal of the
firm said that the bouffant skirt demanded
the slender waistline, which required
high-class corset designing. Mrs. J. T.
Dowd, who helped receive the guests,
wore a smart navy bolero suit with white
trimmings; her navy coarse-straw hat
was upturned with flowers. Mrs. Bernard
Dowd, whose black-pleated two-tiered
skirt was allied to one of the new straight-
over bodices, sported nylons which had
her name, Roma, embroidered up each
side from the ankles. Reta Findlay wore
a smoke-grey fur bolero over her grey
crepe frock, the skirt of which was
swathed round the hips and fully-flared
in front; her large royal-blue straw hat
had pink flowers and royal-blue veiling.
St. John’s Church of England, Toorak,
was decorated with all-white flowers for
the marriage of Lorraine Eleanor, only
daughter of Mrs. Colin Martin, of
Toorak, and the late Dr. Colin Martin,
with Richard Lawrence, second son of
Mr. and Mrs. Helton Daniell, of South
Yarra. A coronet of orange blossoms
topped the bride’s long tulle veil, which
covered her gown of white lace with its
rose design. Her small bouquet was of
stephanotis. Christine Synnot and Mary
Wallace were bridesmaids; their white
tulle frocks were worn with tulle head
drapes, drawn softly to one side and
fastened with brilliant brooches. Hugh
Dentry was best man and Christopher
Daniell groomsman.

THE SERVICE MAN
BROOKE-POPHAM ON SINGAPORE.
“Ek Dum”: The dispatch in
which Air Chief-Marshal Sir
Robert Brooke-Popham outlines
the history of the preparations
for the defence of Malaya makes
it clear that all the chances
had been discussed with care
over a period of two years be-
fore the blow fell. The com-
manders knew very well what
was called for.
They knew that it was impos-
sible to defend even the princi-
pal landing beaches along a
lengthy coastline on which there
were many. They knew that
some of their preparations, such
as those which were made in the
Australian sector about Mersing,
would turn out to be waste
labor, yet that they were needed.
Worse still, they knew from
the beginning that they would
have to fight on the defensive at
the greatest possible disadvan-
tage. Their instructions com-
pelled them to go to the utmost
lengths to stave off hostilities
with the Japanese. They could
not fire a shot even at the most
hostile-looking force without
orders from home unless it was
patently bent almost the next
minute on landing at some
strategic point with a view to
attacking Malaya. They could
not fire at Jap ships at sea till
an act of aggression had been
committed.
When they discovered huge
Japanese convoy fleets at sea,
battleship-escorted, within 300
miles of the north of Malaya,
the day of Pearl Harbor, they
could not strike at them even
though they knew clearly what
they were about. There had
been so little effective intelligence
work, and the Admiralty knew
so little of what was happening
further north, that Repulse was
actually on her way to Darwin
when the war broke out.
When it did come to actual
fight the commanders were
committed to land retreat. They
had been told clearly in Air-
Marshal Popham’s directive that
the requirements of British home
defence, the Battle of the Atlan-
tic and the Middle East must
take precedence over the Pacific
and Indian Ocean, and later the
needs of Russia and, for a
period, of Iran were added to
this formidable list of priorities.
They were No. 6 on the list and
could expect no help from Aus-
tralia.
This assured that Malaya
must accept the irreducible mini-
mum in arms and equipment.
Also it meant that its war
would be an isolated conflict;
that it would have to be fought
for a time as' a sort of siege from
the local base of Singapore,
since it was almost certain that
there would be a phase when
sea communications would be
interrupted. Therefore Singa-
pore was the most vital priority
in defence. While meagre out-
flung forces in the north must
do everything they could to
hamper the momentum of the
enemy, it was inevitable that
they would have to fall back at
once to try to defend the fortress-
island without which no succor
could be received, since without
it the Navy could not operate.
Hopeless from the Start
One senses that the command
knew how hopeless the chances
were from the start, especially
after the destruction of Prince
of Wales and Repulse, which
left the local naval forces
reduced to nothing. There were
the little 5000-ton cruisers
Danse, Dragon and Durban —
Dragon, when she was here
with the Atlantic Fleet in 1924,
performed a gallant feat in the
rescue of the Jap Honolulu
Maru, which was drifting about
in the stormy Tasman with her
bulkheads stove. There was the
Fiji-clas's cruiser Mauritius re-
fitting in the dock. There were
eight destroyers—Jupiter, Elec-
tra. Encounter, Express, Tene-
do&, Thanet, Scout, Stronghold
—in full working order, and the
destroyers Isis and H.M.A.S.
Vampire and Vendetta were
there refitting. The American
zone of operation was limited to
the waters between Darwin and
Sourabaya.
The Problem of “Matador”
The commanders were con-
scious that the vital opening
move, if they were to deal with
an enemy in possession of or
threatening Thailand, must be a
swift and sudden advance in
pursuance of the preplanned
“Operation Matador,” by which
they would seize the Kra Isth-
mus', the bridge down which the
enemy could come and through
which he would maintain his
communications at least 24
hours ahead of a Japanese land-
ing. But this operation was for-
bidden by the politicians alto-
gether until December 5, and
then permission for it was given
only on condition that the
Japanese violated Thailand or
were known to be advancing
themselves to occupy Kra, con-
ditions' which put the whole
movement out of the question.
The Air Defences
The deficiencies in aircraft
were apparent from the first,
and, with a naval shortage, air
strength was vital. The Singa-
pore Conference in October,
1940, decided that 582 aircraft
were needed for the Far East;
while the Chiefs of Staff
Committee agreed that this num-
ber was ideal, they estimated
that 336 would give a very fair
degree of security. This figure
took no account of the defence
of Burma, and was the “bottom
limit.” Though Hong Kong
was included, only three cratt
at Singapore were capable of
reaching it.
A month later the actual air-
craft strength in Malaya (it
must he remembered that the
Battle of Britain was at its
height and Wavell’s advance in
the Middle East about to begin)
consisted.of two squadrons of
Blenheims —24 aircraft two
squadrons of R.A.A.F. Hudsons'
for reconnaissance, two squad-
rons of Vildebeestes —24 aircraft
—l2 R.A.A.F. Wirraways, about
as effective in real combat with
modern machines as windswept
leaves’, and four flying-boats
(Cats).
The Air-Marshal’s telegram
early in 1941 in which he said
“at present not only is our
ability to attack shipping de-
plorably weak, but we have not
the staying - power to sustain
even what we could now do”
is a gem of understatement.
Brewster Buffaloes began to
arrive in February, 1941, but it
was May, 1941, before, with 167
of the little machines in hand,
it was possible to have four
squadrons in being. The pilots
took some time to become
operational. They came fresh
from elementary - training
schools in Australia and N.Z.
Some of the Maorilauders had
never flown any war machine
better than an old Hawker Hart
and had never seen a retractable
undercarriage, 3 variable-pitch
propeller or a flap! It was no
wonder that, splendid fellows as
they were, they were not passed
as fit when war broke out,
especially seeing that no person-
nel could be spared to form a
proper training-school and that
all training had to be done in
the squadrons.
Wirraway men were given
Buffaloes, but were not trained
to full pitch. Reserves of
machines and men were all too
lean, especially since the
Buffalo had a handicap of
about 40 in a love game
when lined up against a Zero,
which could climb to 13,000
feet in 4.3 minutes against the
Buffalo’s 6.1 minutes and which
could notch 315 m.p.h. at
10,000 feet against the Buffalo’s
270.
The manoeuvrability of the
Zeroes made the Buffaloes
(especially with inexperienced
pilots, brave as they were) look
for the most part like lamp-posts.
Night-flying was out of the ques-
tion without flame-dampers for
the exhausts, which were not
available, so that by night the
defence was left to Blenheims
assisted by a.-a. —such as it was.
When war came there were
four Buffalo and one Dutch
fighter squadrons and a Blen-
heim night-fighter squadron on
hand, with scarcely any war-
blooded pilots, whereas what
were needed were seven squad-
rons of fighters at Zero standard,
or better, with men skilled and
experienced.
The total deficiency of the
number required—omitting the
Vildebeestes —was 415 machines,
including reserves. After five
days of fighting only 108
machines' remained, and substan-
tial reinforcements failed to
bring the total number above
127 on Christmas Eve.
The P. 8.1.
On the thoroughly optimistic
basis that there would be 582
aircraft in operation, the cheer-
ful fellows of the Singapore De-
“This might be the last tucker you'll get — they're having
target-practice at daybreak."
fence Conference of 1940 esti-
mated that 26 battalions of in-
fantry, five field regiments and
three light - tank -companies
would be needed apart from
a.-t. troops for local defence of
aerodromes, volunteer units' and
ancillaries. But when General
Percival came in August, 1941,
his estimate was far more
extensive and practical. He
suggested 48 infantry bat-
talions, four Indian recce
units, nine forward artil-
lery regiments, four light a.-a.
regiments, two tank regiments',
three a.-t. regiments, two moun-
tain artillery regiments and 12
field companies.
Air-Marshal Brooke-Popham,
asked for observations, sup-
ported General Percival to the
hilt —“no drastic reduction,” he
said, “could be accepted.”
When December 7 arrived the
establishment was six British
battalions, including one
machine-gun battalion, 18
Indian battalions, six A.I.F. and
one Malay, apart from volun-
teers, Johore military forces and
five battalions of Indian State
forces'.
There were seven field regi-
ments—five of 24 and two of
16 guns, a mountain regiment of
24 guns, two a.-t. regiments, one
of 48 and one of 36 guns', and
two a.-t. batteries, one of six
two-pounders and another of
eight Bredas. Man - power
amounted to 19,391 British,
15,279 Australians,. 37,191
Indians', 4482 Asiatics and about
10,500 volunteers, a quarter of
whom were British of varying
ages.
The overall man-power total
was 86,895. The Army was 17
battalions short in infantry
alone.
Out of 420 anti-aircraft guns
called for only 172 were avail-
able.
Of all the ground shortages,
tanks provided the greatest
worry. There were none and
only half a dozen locally-made
boiler-plate armored cars on De-
cember 7, 1941.
As for small-arms ammunition,
the defence was short of author-
ised holding of 150,000,000
rounds by more than a third.
Australia agreed to increase its
monthly quota of 3,000,000
rounds to 8,000,000 rounds —a
mere fleabite, but useful.
The Japs Arrive
The first sight of the Japa-
nese obtained by Australian
Hudsons at 2 p.m. on December
6 was frightening enough. One
convoy contained 22 10,000-
tonners escorted by the battleship
Kongo, five cruisers and seven
destroyers. Another mustered
21 10,000-tonners escorted by
two cruisers and ten destroyers.
The location of these forces
by R.A.A.F. Hudsons is de-
scribed as a “particularly good
piece of work” in view of their
being at the limit of their pat-
rolling range of 300 miles, a
factor which mad© it impossible
for them to keep contact or
shadow the Japanese until re-
lieved by the three Catalinas
which formed the whole of
Malaya’s long-distance recce
armada.
These started out during the
night, but bad weather in the
relevant area clouded observa-
tion. Sight of the Japanese ships
was lost until the landing at
Kota Bharu from ten ships be-
gan at 1.30 a.m. on Monday,
December 8, only hours be-
fore Jap bombers began to
arrive over Singapore itself in
clouds at from 10,000 to 14,000
feet. There was a bright full
moon and no blackout, and the
A.R.P. organisation (in civil
hands) had not beei#manned. It
was left to the Fighter Group
H.Q. to sound the sirens for the
civil-defence operations to be-
gin-
The first force in action
against the enemy was the No.
1 R.A.A.F. squadron at Kota
Bharu, which with Nos. 36 and
100 Vildebeeste squadrons
sank numerous landing-craft and
did other signal damage, and a
ship supposed to be loaded with
tanks was sent to the bottom.
Japs Underestimated
It is amazing, despite the fact
that the Americans had broken
the Japanese code in July and
knew exactly that plans were in
train for a drive southward, that
this information does not seem
to have been communicated to
the Singapore command, which
“did not believe till the end of
November that the Japanese
might be on the verge of start-
ing war.” And Intelligence,
while it made a correct esti-
mate of the forces Japan could
use at the beginning, had under-
estimated their ability to attack
at several points over an area
thousands of miles wide simul-
taneously.
It was never anticipated that
they would take on Malaya and
the Philippines at once.
There was no anticipation of
Japanese tactical novelties which
afterwards became so familiar
and general —the fast, lightly-
clad screen before main advanc-
ing bodies, armed with light
automatic weapons and 40
rounds and a few grenades —
troops often mistaken for
Chinese or Malays untilit was
too late, many of them being
disguised. And nobody had
thought of the effect of the use
of noise in the best Chinese
fashion —it caused great laughter
among white troops upon
young Indians. Neither had
anybody bargained for Nippon’s
use of rubber wading-belts for
creek and river crossings, which
speeded their advance tremend-
ously.
These failures in estimation
were not the only disabilities.
Inexperience was the greatest
bugbear apart from shortages
in the defending forces. In
Indian regiments there were
rarely more than two or three
senior officers who could talk
the language and who knew
their Indians. These factors and
the necessity of retreat—London
and Malaya were unanimous—
in order to concentrate on saving
Singapore base were important.
A retreat policy carried out
day after day was bound to
have adverse effects on the
best battalion in the world,
especially when operated in
a tropic climate. Thus, what-
ever happened to morale was,
in Air Vice-Marshal Brooke-
Popham’s opinion, “attribut-
able to the general situation
rather than to any fault in the
morale of the men themselves.”
At the same time, in the sketchy
training which had been mingled
with fortification and other
duties in an unaccustomed
climate, the commander thinks it
possible that “the need for offen-
sive action even during a retreat
had not been stressed to officers,
and men so as to become second
nature, and thus, a. tendency de-
veloped to use reserves to hold
a weak portion of a defensive
position rather than retaining
them at all costs to develop a
counter-attack. There was again
a tendency to use the Indepen-
dent Company as a reinforce-
ment, instead of using it for
functions for which it was in-
tended. The lesson had not been
rammed home that occasions
arise when rearguard parties
must hold to the last man even
while the main body is moving
fast away.
Australia’s Part
The R.A.F.’s problems were
great. There were insufficient
rifles and. tommy-guns to arm
ground-staffs. It lacked staff
officers to form a necessary
second group H.Q. —and there
was no such luxury as a plan-
ning staff, all hands and the cook
being needed in operations room.
Also, defence of the naval base
called for the weakening of
fighter forces in the North.
The Air-Marshal speaks of
the co-operation of the Dutch,
and more especially of their sub-
marines’ gallantry in the Gulf
of Siam and of the work done
by the guerrilla band which they
sent to operate in the Japanese
rear to the north of Malaya as
the war tide swept southward.
The report is necessarily in-
complete since Air-Marshal
Brooke-Popham handed over the
Supreme Command of the Far
East to General Paget (succeeded
shortly afterwards by General
Pownall) and left eventually at
the end of December.
But it forms a splendid back-
ground against which to evalu-
ate later events.

Ancestors of an Industry
The Biblical exhortation to "praise famous men and our
fathers that begat us” is one which Britain may well take to
heart, especially in the field of the Sciences. She has ever
been too ready to acquiesce in the claims of other nations to
lead the world in scientific resource and invention, when
history reveals that Britons stand second to none among the
world's scientific pathfinders and pioneers. It is with the
object of demonstrating that Britain has always been in the
van of scientific progress that this series of announcements,
under the title "Ancestors of an Industry,” has been prepared.
It will tell the story from Robert of Chester, the English monk
who in 1144 opened the door of Eastern chemical knowledge
to Western Europe, up through the centuries to Sir William
Bragg and Lord Rutherford, whose researches in the present
century led to the liberation of atomic
energy. These announcements will, it is
hoped, serve to give the people of Britain
a new sense of the richness of their heritage,
and nations overseas some idea of the debt
the world owes to British scientists and
chemists.

AND ITS
RED MILL RUM.
Two good horses, Scotwyn and St.
Fairy, brought off a just-on-perfect
all-round double at Moonee Valley
on Saturday: the pair of them sons
of St. Magnus, trained by T. Lewis,
ridden by R. Heather and owned by
O. Porter.
Scotwyn’s success in the five-fur-
longs Electric Handicap (first division)
was the colt’s fourth in a row. He
was admirably handicapped; his 9.7
well merited, yet not a mere win-
preventing burden. There could be
more such handicapping, especially
of youngsters. It is. surely not the
right object of a handicapper merely
to stop a good horse. Scotwyn beat
Rembrandt and Phoibos by two
lengths.
Under 7.4, the Hellespont filly Bless-
ing won the other division by a wider
margin (four lengths) and in slightly
better time; Blitzmark and Delhi
next. Bengal (favorite) was fourth,
carrying 8.12, and will do better;
but Blessing is a good filly.
St. Fairy had his win in the mile
C. F. Orr Stakes (wi.a.); just head-
ing Chanak on the post, with Lungi
third. Attley, getting into form, was
next. Anything that beats Chanak
from now on will be puffing.
Lucky Robin matched his name in
beating Nagation in the 10-furlongs
Wyndham Handicap. Nagation, after
some interference, failed by half a
head; Antares took third money.
Leonard, good on his day, broke
down past any further racing.
The Agincourt three-year-old colt
Dumfries equalled the course record
(1.12) for the odd distance of six
furlongs less 20 yards in beating Up-
heaval half a head, with another
half-head to Mahram, in the Marine
Handicap (first division). Over from
Adelaide, the Powerscourt three-year-
old colt Comedy Prince lived up to
his repute as a galloper out of the
ordinary in winning the second
division very easily from Jalna and
High Production.
That a race isn’t won till the weight-
flag goes up was given a new twist
in the mile Welter. Oatcake having
got home well ahead of St. Buzz and
Hemlock, some mix-up led to
“Weight” being broadcast throughout
the land instead of “Protest.” Con-
sequently there was paying out on
Oatcake and much tearing of St.
Buzz tickets at Randwick and other
courses, with much tearing of hair
when there was word of the protest,
which was upheld, with St. Buzz
placed first.
* * * *
One of the most eye-taking young-
sters at Randwick on Saturday was
the Brueghel filly Wattle; a well-
developed, powerful light chestnut.
She didn’t win, but that wasn’t sur-
prising. She was loaded with 9.10,
a crushing burden for a two-year-old
filly. The weight stopped Wattle
over the last furlong, Sheba (G.
Moore) running past Cornelian, with
Matinee a promising third. Wattle
(fifth) was ridden by D. Munro, he
having the day before come out on
top in the only appeal he ever made
against a stewards’ suspension. Cor-
nelian only needs a clear break, and
no Wattle, to be a winner; she and
Wattle beat each other. Note that
Pax Vobis was badly left.
Another to take the eye was Grey
Boots, who, with young Selkrig up,
downed Cragside and Gallipoli in the
six-furlongs event for two-year-old
colts and geldings. There’s no doubt
about these grey Nizamis, with the
emphasis very much on the grey.
Gallipoli, also by that sire, is a
chestnut; another of the breed,
Foxami, who finished nowhere, is a
bay. Hiraji, Nizam’s Ring, Grey
Nurse, Grey Boots —there’s certainly
no doubt about the greys. Hiraji,
by the way, has 8.9 —a very nice
weight—in the Sydney Cup.
Grey Boots (from St. Cloud) is as
grey as they make them; a regular
little rocking-horse, with black mane
and tail; blocky and compact. Crag-
side, a Felcrag colt, went uncom-
monly well for one having a first
run.
The boys over the fence kicked up
hell’s delight when Native Son (E.
Fordyce) mowed down the Glenfield
Handicap field, most conclusively de-
feating Barnsley and Smooth Action,
both with a big advantage over him
in the weights. The dry, firm track
was to Native Son’s liking—he’s evi-
dently no good at all on any other
sort. He towered over the field in
appearance, and how much he did
so in fact was shown by his win-
ning with 9.9, while the next five
to him in the weights were all un-
placed. The favorite, Farhad, who
seemed to go unkindly from the start
and finished nowhere, is a Nizami;
a chestnut. Native Son has 9.5 in
the Newmarket, but these Sydney
fields he has been beating have had
no Assams and suchlike in them.
The 12-furlongs Warwick February
Handicap saw New Cashmere (J.
Thompson) just defeat Alkestu in a
photo.-finish, with Cape Neddick
third. As any form guide it didn’t
seem to matter very much.
An Encourage, also over a mile and
a half, was as funny as a circus,
which it most resembled. Nainor
stood at the post and watched them
canter away for a furlong. Then
Kerrigan got him interested, and be-
fore they’d gone two furlongs he’d
caught them and passed some of
them, and he didn’t look to be
exactly flying, either. The whole event
continued on thpse lines till they got
well into the straight, where about
half a dozen of them charged abreast;
Tessie March, who’d had the -sweetest
“ You'll have to see about mending that fence some time ,
Andy.”
of passages all through, forging out,
with Sun King and Orion next.
Anyway, Tessie March was a
winner for jockey N. Sellwood—after
his being on 82 successive losers.
She was, moreover, a hot favorite.
Sellwood’s tough luck was back with
him a couple of races later: he was
on the photo.-beaten Alkestu. The
final event, a mile Welter, was won
in fine style by the imported Precipi-
tation five-year-old horse Cursory (J.
Thompson), with Tattling and Indarra
next. Traddles (K. Birrer) led all the
way to defeat Braganza and Caribbean
in the 10-furlongs Novice for three-
year-olds. Braganza should have
won it.
* * * #
“Kiah” Bastian, possibly Adel-
aide’s best jockey, has dropped out
of the racing game. He learned it
as apprentice to Heywood at Caul-
field (Vic.), but moved to Adelaide
in 1935, and has been at the top
or thereabouts ever since. At 40,
he has for some time been talking
of retiring, and a two-months sus-
pension by the stewards for careless
riding made him throw in his licence.

Some 167 years ago an ancestor
of Lord Derby (who has passed on
at 82) founded and lent his name
to the Derby Stakes —today the
classic race of the world’s Turf.
“Derby” has become practically a
synonym for “classic event” in nearly
any form of racing; horses, dogs,
pigeons, speedcars and even billy-
goats. Lord Derby three times won
the race founded by his ancestor and
collected in all over £BOO,OOO in
stakes. Apart from racing some of
the finest horses of the past half-
century he bred scores of other good
’uns at his model stud. He was
a powerful force in the Jockey Club,
in nursing racing through the diffi-
cult war and post-war years and in
maintaining the' supreme standard of
the British thoroughbred.

tances) :

In the fifth Test, the Australians,
as the racing scribes put it, were “just
plodding along in front,” having again
won the toss and piled up a first-
innings total of 575 (declared), with
India once more starting disastrously,
1 for 2, though after that Mankad
batted in his fine style against the
odds.
Bradman, who looked capable of
making 575 himself, pulled a rib-
muscle and had to retire after knock-
ing up an easy 57. Brown, with a
solid 99 (run out), played himself
into the touring side. S. Loxton and
N. Harvey, on trial, respectively hit
up 80 and 153.'
’Keeper Sen did his best to steady
the opposition, catching four, and
there were only 8 sundries. Eight
Indian bowlers were tried out.
Though beaten by 98 runs by
N.S.W., Westralia, still going great
guns in its first Sheffield Shield bid,
gave Queensland 446 to catch in
Brisbane, D. Watt contributing
129 and Buttsworth and Kessey 60
apiece. O’Dwyer tickled up the
Queensland wickets, taking 5 of the
6 down when play ended on Saturday,
with the Q. score 270.
“A.D.”: Dr. George Robinson, of
the Westralian team, is the only be-
spectacled cricketer playing today in
the big matches in Australia. There
have been few in big cricket; and
what makes Dr. Robinson all the
more of a rarity is that it’s as a
batsman that he has won his place.
“Mat”: It’s a long time since an
Australian XI had an all-rounder who
could get the “double” of 1000 runs
and 100 wickets on an English tour.
Those who have done it inolude
George Giffen (1454 runs and 162
wickets in 1886, 1280 and 148 in
1893, 1208 and 117 in 1896), G.
Palmer (1056 and 110 in 1886), Hugh
Trumble (1183 and 142 in 1899),
Warwick Armstrong (2002 and 130 in
1905, 1480 and 126 in 1909 and
1405 and 106 in 1921), and Jack
Gregory (1171 and 120 in 1921).
There have not been any such in
the last 28 years. Bobby Peel (1011
runs and 213 wickets in 1887-88) was
the lone English player to get the
“double” in Australia.
Westralia has reported an addition
to odd run-outs. In a Railways com-
petition match a few weeks back a
well-whaclfed ball hit “silly mid-on’s”
head (“almost knocking him out’),
bounced back and skittled the stumps
at the bowler’s end, with the batsman
there yards out of his crease.
Victorian swimmer
John Marshall easily
held his Australian
220 yards title at
Manly (N.S.W.), de-
feating the local War-
ren Boyd and Wes-
tralian Garrick Agnew.
Marshall, who shapes
like doing even better,
went 3/5-second faster
than his last year’s
winning time.

This year’s “Ampol”
golf tournament (£lOOO
from Aust. Motorists’
Petrol Co. and Alba
Petroleum Co., plus a
percentage of the gate-
money) is to be played
at Huntingdale, Melbourne, April
14-17. Over 72 holes, it’s the richest
pro. event in Australia. Last year
the places went to Pickworth, Bill
Bolger and Cremin.

Boxing continually on the retreat,
but mixing it willingly enough as he
went backwards and getting home the
cleaner punches, Jackie Wilson (9.4)
just beat Frank Donnelly (9.8£) at
Leichhardt. Donnelly’s non-stop
attack put him ahead early, but Wil-
son steadily piled up the winning
points and his flurry in the last round
clinched it.
* * * *
Using his head for other purposes
than thinking, Bernie Grant (8.12)
still couldn’t damage Ken Wenman
(8.13£) in their savage clash at Mel-
bourne Stadium. Wenman well on
points.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Blime”: Making the long trip into
town for a special appointment I found
I’d left my watch behind. But I spotted
old Alec mending a fence by the road
and pulled up. He hauled out a large
timepiece. “Just twenty t’ two,” he
answered me, “an’ she’s right to the
minute. Take a loan of it if
it’s important,” he offered nobly. “I’ll
be here when you’re coming back. Be
careful of it, won’t y’?” he added. “I’ye
had it a long time, and a bloke sort o’
gets used to a thing like that.” I slipped
the watch into my pocket and rode on.
Later I glanced at it —and blinked. There
was nothing but *a blank face. Both
hands were gone. I felt in my pocket,
rubbed a thumb wonderingly over the
glass, and laughed. That night I returned
it to'the old chap, thanked him solemnly,
but couldn’t refrain from asking
why he carried the thing. “To tell the
time, o’ course,” he replied, looking at
me pityingly. “Y’ can easy see where
the big hand’s bin broke orf, an’ that
gives y’ the d’rection. As for the little
one, cripes, any goat knows what hour
it is” —and he slid the treasure into his
pocket.
* * * *
“Zake”: His name was Tim
O’Flaherty, and he lived in a bough-and-
bark kipsy on the river-bend. He con-
fessed to a strong belief in the circle
chalked round the hut to keep out ants;
he was quite certain that meat wouldn’t
be ’blown if it was kept about 15ft. up
on a pole, even in the sun, that being
too high for the blowflies. I could see
by the bulge in his trousers pocket that
he kept a spud in it to ward off rheuma-
tism. And of course he took his oath
that a red rag hung round a horse’s neck
would keep off the botflies, and that a
snake massaged between the shoulder-
blades with a heavy waddy in the morn-
ing woufdn’t die till sundown. I was
going to ask him whether he believed
McGirr would make good his promise of
90,000 houses in N.S.W. in three years—
but what was the use? His answer would
be a foregone conclusion.
* * * *
“Totem”: Bunyip waterhole, in
Queensland’s Monto district, and believed
to be the crater of an extinct volcano, has
long been taboo by the abos, as they aver
that if anyone fell in he would disappear.
Close by is Telebang Mountain, in the
vicinity of which cattle have stampeded
for no apparent reason. / A few days
afterwards subterranean rumblings were
heard in the mountain, and this almost
coincided with the big earthquake in the
Philippines. There seems reasonable
ground for belief that the Telebaqg
rumblings were a tentacle of the main
disturbance. Even if it proves nothing
regarding the boong and his taboo, the
peculiar mass terror evinced by the cattle
point to a telepathy even more sensitive
than Homo sapiens’ seismograph.
♦ * * *
“Old-timer”: The old gum leaned well
out over the river on the downstream side
of a clump of native willow and flood-
drift, and Jimmy Gallagher caught so
many fish from it that he nailed a few
boards on the bough and made himself a
comfortable seat. On warm afternoons
he’d drop a line in and sit, half-dozing,
till some cod s.wam up and hooked itself
on. There came young Walker, who dis-
covered Jimmy’s seat. Young Walker hid
himself in the willow, waited till Jimmy
was half-asleep, fished for Jimmy’s line
and drew it gently in. Then he fastened
it to the wire loop in the lid cut from
a kero.-tin and waited. Jimmy awoke,
gave the line a tug, then sat up and began
to pull. The line swished from side to
side, Jimmy “played it,” danced with
excitement at the gleam flashing in the
depths and, after about 10 minutes,
hauled it in. He said only one word, but
it meant everything he felt.
♦ * * *
“M 8”: The only two abos. I saw
throwing a returning boomerang (B.
4/2/’4B) caught it the same way, though
strangers to one another and 600 miles
apart. They didn’t “grab as it goes past,”
but rather slid the palm of one hand
under the whirling missile and went with
it slightly while the other palm overtook
and clamped down on it, acting more
like a brake than a grab.
* * ♦ *
“Salmon Gums”: A group of Balts,
who’ve been acclimatising at Bonegilla,
are coming to sou’-Westralian timber
forests. They’ll work well, and those
who stand up to the climate may become
good fellers —no pun intended. But when
they see expert axemen at work they’ll
realise that the job’s all ahead of them.
Strange that countries possessing won-
derful natural forests, which they guard
and preserve with a rigidly-enforced con-
servation system, have never bred a race
of axemen. The forests of Germany are
a timberman’s paradise—tall, straight
giants so closely grown that a dozen trees
may be dropped, each resting on the
"Give her a spin and I'll have five bob on that one."
next, before one hits the ground. Yet
when a couple of Australian p.-0.-w.
commenced felling operations the
countryfolk for miles around flocked to
view their art, and marvelled. Our
blokes swung a strange blade, wider and
shorter than the Australian axe, but they
considered it quite good for that timber,

Lower Tops 1 : For the first time for
nearly nine years, three square-riggers will
load South Australian wheat cargoes for
Europe. All pre-war contestants of the
grain race, the former Danish training
barque Viking, and the 55-year-old four-
master Lawhill, are already loading at
Port Victoria (S.A.) after running from
South Africa to Spencer’s Gulf in ballast
in 50-odd days. Also, the fine ex-German
“saltpetreman” Passat is on her way
back from Port Swettenham, where she
took a load of Australian jarrah. To-
gether with the New Zealand-owned
Pamir, recently arfived in the Thames,
these four vessels seem the only wind-
jammers in commission in the world
today. Rope and cordage supplies are

“Ex-C.0.”: Steinbeck must have seen
that picture ot a nursing mother “using
a simple stratagem" to feed her old
father through prison bars (B. 4/2/48).
He uses exactly that means to feed an
ancient character in The Grapes of
Wrath.
* * * *
“The 0.D.”: Well, well, well; it looks
as though every American Army chief
with an ounce of pride will up and resign,
Yes, sirree bob, they can’t do anything
else since that eminent artillerist “Narrin”
(B. 4/2/’4B) has so drastically condemned
the sights on their automatic carbines
and infantry tommy-guns. Not worth a
cracker, says he, after vainly trying to
see a grey euro against a grey back-
ground. Could be that “N.” is ageing
and his sight fading; still, he ought to tell
the worried U.S. boys just what sort of a
sight would make a grey object any
clearer against a grey background. Some
coves like straight-stemmed pipes, some
like ’em curly—but then, who’m I to
cavil? Isn’t “N.” the cove who shoots
the Murray rapids in a canoe, idly picking
off Joe Blakes with a .22 as they slither
along the distant shores?
* * * *
“23-4”: “W.P.T.” rushed hurriedly into
the Council (B. 4/2/’4B) to assert that
“We lost many traps on the South Coast
because the wedgetails” easily pulled the
peg from the ground and “flew off with
the lot.” In anything but loose sand a
calf couldn’t pull a properly-pegged trap
out, since it has to get a direct upward
pull. An eagle would have to hover two
feet above ground and tug with its other
claw or something. The birds that got
his traps might have been downy, but I
doubt that they wore feathers.
“Betcha”: In these East Gippsland
parts it is no uncommon sight to see a
wedgetailed eagle flying around with a
trap dangling from his foot. A big eagle
can lift even a pegged trap, and for that
reason we tether our rabbit-traps
to trees. So handicapped, the chances
are against the bird catching food for
himself, and he would necessarily live on
carrion alone, while the supply lasted.
A wedgie can both land and take-off
burdened by the ironmongery. I once
saw an eagle in flight with a trap dangling
from each foot.

“C. Bene”: Rented a cottage, sight un-
seen, on the N.S.W; South Coast last
month and found myself planked fair in
the middle of a wild-life sanctuary. Tall
gums grow right to the sea’s rim and
the underbrush is banksia, wattles, tree-
ferns, ti-tree, casuarina and acacias, with
bracken for a carpet. It’s many a long
year since 1 enjoyed such a festival of
birds. At dawn wattle-birds chuckled
and scolded among the banksias, superb-
warblers enriched the acacia thickets, and
jn the gums a variety of honeyeaters
trilled to the sun. Tits and wrens
a bounded, there were doves and wonga-
pigeons and, of course, the kookaburra
and crow. Every now and then a choir
of magpies would excel them all. A
man could sit for hours in that bush,
listening and watching, and any minute
j expected to hear the call “Wippegong”
and se e t h a t indefatigable Aboliar flit
o’er 0 ’ er th e bracken, his pen ready and eyes
and ears o p en to the feathered wonders

as were t h e spirits of all the Aboliars,
embodied in the busy, cheeky, friendly,
skiting and pugnacious family of wag-
tads tj ia j ; lived in the backyard,

“What about him givin’ us a demon-

“Martin Gale”: One of the wagons of
a goods-train being lazily shunted around
the station-yard of a small country town
caught fire. The enginedriver and coal-
heaver, with commendable presence of
mind, decided to take the whole train,
blazing truck and all, 200 yards up
the line to the big overhead water-tank
and flood the truck with th& canvas
hydrant. But the local volunteer fire-
brigade, newly-formed and very en-
thusiastic, was not to be robbed of
its first chance of honor and glory.
The firemen ordered the driver to
shunt the burning truck back to the
station, where stood a 500-gallon sea-
tank, complete with a hand-tap for drink-
ing purposes. After a flow of curses
he complied, and after much giv-
ing of orders a bucket-brigade got into
action. The blaze was extinguished after
it had burnt right down to the bogie, and
the heroes dispersed to pubs and homes
to spread the tale of their success.

“Bogaduck”: All frogs don’t spend six
months between the tadpole and adult
stage (B. 21/1 /’4B). Out in the desert
country of W.A. the “water”-frog exca-
vates burrows in the sand in which it
hides by day; at night it emerges to feed
on insects and to absorb moisture from
the air through its skin ; some which we
tested out by enclosing them in gauze
cages would double their weight between
8 p.m. and midnight through absorbed
water alone. The desert abo. knew this
frog well and made good use of its water-
absorbing powers by carrying them in
string baskets lined with leaves; when a
drink was required a frog’s skin was
tickled and the exuding drops of water
licked off. At night the frogs were
released to feed and absorb water ; those
which didn’t return to the bags of their
own accord before dawn were tracked
down and recaptured. Instinct still
governs their breeding, the eggs being
laid only after rain, but they are laid
in a burrow and guarded by the females
until they hatch into tiny adult frogs,
which soon grow to full size. The tad-
pole stage is passed in the egg. The
only time we ever saw these frogs in
daylight was just after rain; they would
then come out and hop about on the
wet sand. Possibly other frogs of the
type emerging in the same way give rise
to the “rain of frogs” theory in other
places.
♦ ♦ * *
“Fossil Downs”: But were those
American sharpshooters in training mugs
enough to go pot-hunting for squirrel
with a lead ball (B. 7/1/’48)? Watching
my fellow-Australians, I note that when
hunting the kangaroo, the number of
skin perforations being a matter of
financial import, they invariably use a
rifle and bullet. But when seeking mere
sustenance, even in the shape of the
aforesaid ’roo, they make sure of their
mark by using shot, which has the pro-
perty of spreading in direct ratio to the
distance it travels. So I take it that
these canny Yankee backwoodsmen used
shot, not the lead ball that romantic
modern pavement hunters credit them
with. And they could make shot as
easy as lead balls. A tin with small per-
forations suspended 6ft. above a tub of
water, with molten lead poured in, will
provide shot good enough for ordinary
pot-hunting.

“Dronestung”: I’ve watched virgin
queens take mating flights from the hives,
usually a few days after the old queens
or sister virgins have cast off with swarms.
Her Highness steps out confidently on to
the doorstep, heads upwards in spiralling
flight and returns after anything up to
20 minutes. Sometimes she flies on two
or three days before being mated. Some-
times the general routine during her
absence is undisturbed ; at other times 2
panic sets in. It begins with a few bees
running about the entrance with worried
looks, and pretty soon half the colony >5
whirling in and out in excitement. J
dies quickly when the queen spiral-'
down with a high-pitched droning, m-
on air-brakes and alights on the landing,
to be escorted over the threshold wit»
all the respectful attention lavished on a
royal bride.
THE DRAUGHT.
I like the long, white blaze of nose
That gives your head its clean design;
Your great big frame —the strength it shows;
Your high, strong back’s most perfect line.
I like the whiskers on your chin,
The homely way you stand and stare ;
Then, when you show your teeth, the grin
That seems to me to settle there.
I like your great big belly, too,
Where veins like ropes around it run;
Your trusting eyes that stare men through
And ask for chaff when work is done.
I’ve seen you oft, pulling the plough,
Leaving a trail of dust behind,
In some red field or hilly brow
Your mane and tail caught in the wind.
You, with your massive hooves, thick shod,
Your hairy gaiters coarse and long,
Stamping your weight against the sod,
Arching your neck so thick and strong.
I like the way your chaff you grind,
Your nostrils when they blow full red,
The breadth and beam of your behind,
The massiveness of your fine head.
Sometimes I see you in the shade,
Your head in shadow ’gainst the light,
Beneath the trees, a picture made
To please the artist’s perfect sight.
Great draught, dried sweat adown your flanks,
Grinding your feed at day’s soft close,
In these my lines let man give thanks,
And let me stroke your long, white nose.
VICTORIA.
JAMES HACKSTON.


“Wippegong”; Along some of our
main railway systems, just at the edge of
the ballast, there now stretches a faint
track of pale fawn, deepening here and
there into a little golden patch the
spilled wheat from the grain-trucks.
There doesn’t seem to be any great con-
gregation of seed-eating birds; maybe
the season has been such a fat one that
there’s enough and to spare. Sooner
or later, I suppose, the birds will
clean it all up, for you don’t see wheat
established as one of the grasses along
the line. It took me back to Lashio and
the little tattooed Shans waiting patiently
beside the strip for the arrival of the
rice planes. Trucks were always waiting,
and the aircraft were smartly unloaded,
but although a prompt return was desir-
able time was always found to allow the
little brown men to swarm into the
Dakota and scrape out the loose grain.
Stubby fingers ran along the corrugations
of the floor, cleaned up under the ’chutes
at the back, scraped up fallen grain
from the ground below the door; then
round faces cracked into smiles and the
scroungers vanished. I wonder if there
are people today who would like to dive
on the yellow patches which tell where
the heavy trains waited op a siding;
even wonder how close we were to hav-
ing to do that sort of thing ourselves.
Or shouldn’t we remember those perilous
months?
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: More curious
than the tides around Thursday Island
(B. 21 /1 / ’4B) are those on the north
coast of New Guinea between Madang
and the mouth of the Sepik River. There,
in a small naval vessel on and off for
18 months, we spelled at an idealistic
ship anchorage beside Tomakot village.
A verdant coral basin, it was protected
by a barrier-reef abounding with all the
wonders of coral. At that spot never
once during daylight hours did we en-
counter low water —it always occurred at
night. At T.I. an ocean current seems
to flow continually from east to west,
modified by the tide. But along the
Madang coast there is a nor’-westerly
current most of the year, with a sou’-
westerly one during the North-West
season. And in between seasons occa-
sionally there is no current.

“Bughouse”; Science nowadays puts
forth the theory that first life on our
planet took the form of bacteria capable
of digesting iron and iron compounds.
Thus organic life which by every rule
should have required organic life to feed
upon was able to make a meal of an
inorganic substance, while in itself pro-
viding an organic food for bacteria, a
shade higher in development. In the
same way, too, the vast beds of haematite
ore were laid down, enriching large
areas of the present world. This iron-
eating bacteria, of course, still persists.
Recently I came into possession of a
black-iron tank which had served as
water-holder in a wagon that had
traversed considerable areas of the bush,
being refilled a thousand times from all
sorts of water supplies. The odd thing
about this tank, and the reason why it
had been discarded, was that water
within a couple of days became putrid
and foul with rust. Only by burning
it out at a nearly red heat did I clean
it. Seemed as though, somewhere on its
travels, it had picked up an infection of
those original iron-eating germs, for the
action was much too rapid for the
ordinary chemical process of rusting.

‘Colonial Cove”: Eyre’s journey
across the head of the Bight was neither
mad nor a “dash” (B. 7/l/’4B). Eyre
had been to W.A. previously, had found
a good market for stock, landed by ship
at Albany and then overlanded to York
and Perth. He*thus viewed the verdure
of Westralia’s south-west. And as this
extended a then-unknown distance east
towards S.A. it seemed feasible that a
stock-route might be mapped between
the two colonies. He was not alone in
this, for at the same time such a venture
was under consideration by Raphael
Clint, surveyor, and Captain Bannister,
first overlander Perth to Albany, the pair
seeking a Government subsidy for out-
fitting and a monopoly of the route for a
number of years. Captain George Grey,
at the time in S.A., gave Eyre encourage-
ment, himself having travelled con-
siderably in s.-w. W.A. So when
Eyre* west from Fowler’s Bay,
struck dry country he kept on, hoping
soon to meet the fertile W.A. fringe.
This was further west than he ex-
pected. But it must have been an extra-
bad year; the cattle-route was there
all right, with a little expenditure on
well-sinking. For in 1903 the Halfords
of Tarcoola (S.A.), parents, three sons,
four daughters, with 300 head of cattle,
mostly dairy stock, set off for Kalgoorlie.
Following Eyre’s route, more or less, they
were 17 months on the way, eventually
reaching the W.A. goldfields capital
without serious loss.
“Solitude”: I’d been dimly aware of
Seventyfiver growling away about some-
thing throughout the day, but it wasn’t
till the following morning I got the
strength of his grouch, “They shouldn’t
be allowed t’ sell such flamin’ shirts,” he
declared, collecting his trappings for go-
ing out, “It’s gettin’ worse. Not only
the rotten stuff they make ’em out o’, an’
the price they charge, but, cripes, now
they don’t even sew the bits t’gether
prop’ly,” “Does look a bit rough at the
joints,” I agreed, taking a screw at his
nearly-new garment. “An’ not a button
on the thing,” he pointed out, rubbing a
mit over his chest. “ ’Course the buttons
ain’t so important, not on a shirt, but the
silly cows oughter try an’ put the pockets
in the right place. It’s like them coats
that’s got pockets stuck all round the
inside where y’ can’t get anything out.
Three times I lorst me ’bacca yest’y.”
He stopped to stow his tobacco away
carefully. “All George’s fault,” he went
on. “I told him t’ give me a shirt with a
decent pocket. I’ll roar him up,” he
added. “Got t’ go in this mornin’, an’
I’ll make him change the thing,” He
departed, but I’d give a bit to be in the
store and see old George’s dial when he
spots the old cove’s shirt on inside out.

“Esk D.”: The day is a scorcher, and
somewhere there is a blazing forest fire,
spreading quickly and threatening to
pierce a low gap in the ranges. As the
smoke thickens the sun becomes a dull-
red, bloated disk struggling to penetrate.
A dozen danger-points have to be
watched continuously. Then comes word
that one prong of the fire is descending
on Abe Walters’ farm three miles below
the township, where the long, dry grass
would send the inferno sweeping up
the valley. For a couple of hours a
procession of cars and horsemen streams
down the road, while not long after
the familiar car of a neighbor arrives
in the township. Joe, the ancient pub
rouseabout, hobbles over for informa-
tion. “Is the fire safe yet?” he wants
“Back into the queue or you'll get nothing!"
to know. “Dunno,” replies the driver.
“Last I heard they was runnin’ a break
round Abe’s back fence.” “Well, what’s
wrong that you’re not helpin’?” Joe wants
to know. “You ought t’ be there, seein’
your place is next t’ Abe’s.” “Strike
me roan,” says the truant. “You’re as
bad as all those blokes fightin’ the fire
an’ not one of ’em with the sense t’
guard the keypoints. Gripes, where’d they
have t’ go after puttin’ it out if I hadn’t
had the brains t’ be on hand t’ save the
pub?”
* * * ' *
“Flip”: Short of company, Alf greeted
the campers beaming, allowed them to
pitch on the river-bank, and vowed that
they' “wouldn’t get better drinkin’-water
this side of Sunrise.” But among the
party was a fellow with horn-rimmed
glasses, a “complete camper” who’d
brought along a water-testing kit, and
who informed Alf that his beautiful water
was “highly polluted with bacteria.” Alf
bit hard and glumly watched them pack
and head for the falls on Crow Bend,
where, after testing the wog-content, the
“Go and lean on the fence —you're spilling the baby's milk!"
scientific bloke voted it safe to drink.
For a couple of days Alf was quiet; then,
after some midnight horse-work that
brought his team home gasping, he broke
into a devilish grin. He still wore it when
he rode over to the campers in the morn-
ing and found them having breakfast.
Great panic followed his statement;
“Well, this here water-testin’ might be
all right, but you’d never catch me
drinkin’ thirty yards downstream from
a drowned cow.” There he left them.
Riding home he was joined by Harry,
his neighbor, and professed great amaze-
ment at Harry’s story of the Jersey that
“had died last Chewsday up near the
road, and had then somehow got down
to the crick.”

“The Rabbiter”: Because of the un-
usually heavy rains and the consequent
grey skies that have so far largely
characterised Victoria’s summer, blue-
wrens, robins and other birds are still
tending nests, and shrubs that should
have flowered long ago are just sending
out experimental blooms. Generally the
season is out of joint and at least
a month late. One outcome is the
postponement of the Victorian duck
opening until March 1. No bird has en-
joyed the late summer rains more than
the “old blackie,” and they are still breed-
ing profusely. For the first time in the
Cabbage Garden’s history the duck and
the quail season will open on the same
day.

“Macnell”: Professor Beebe in his
deep-water diving-sphere (B. 7/1 / ’4B) had
to overcome a frightful natural force.
He was half a mile down. Each 33ft.
of depth the pressure increases by one
atmosphere (14.71 b. per square inch);
at the depth he reached this would swell
to half a ton pressing on every square
inch of surface. A submarine at this
depth would be crushed like a jam-tin
under a steamroller. So a chamber of
immense strength had to be constructed.
A spherical design was chosen because
a ball is the most perfect shape for even
distribution of weight.
The shape was simple.
Not as tall as a man,
4ft. 9in. in diameter,
the dome’s walls were
Hin. thick, the whole
weighing 54001 b.
There were three win-
dows of fused quartz.
Sin. thick. Quartz was
selected because it is
the strongest known
transparent substance,
and in addition trans-
mits all waves of light
—an important con-
sideration when no
man knew what colors
would be encountered
half a mile down. To
lower it a special
cable of “true-lay,”
non - twisting wire,
the same as is used
to catapult a warship’s aircraft, was
made. Its breaking-strain was 29
tons. In the depths, Beebe reported
that “we had no difficulty in breathing,
the air remaining fresh throughout our
three hours’ immersion. But we suffered
from intense cold.” Outside that tiny
ball swinging at the end of its long wire,
a giant hand was squeezing it with a
pressure that, given the slightest fault in
its design, would have pulped its occu-
pants,
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: A shellfish could hardly
be credited with having personality, but
there is certainly something fascinating
about the actions of a small pipi when
a breaker has licked back leaving him
(and perhaps hundreds of his mates)
stranded. Tentatively his fawn or cream-
mottled shells open a crack, and what
could be described as a proportionally
immense “tongue” creeps out. If nothing
threatens, a few slight licking movements
make the beginning of a small hole in
the water-washed sand; there is a pause,
then suddenly, with a vigor unexpected
in a mollusc, the creature hoists itself
to a “bottoms-up” position. Again there
is a second’s pause as the shellfish bah
ances on the equivalent of its nose, then,
driven by a pulsing action like the pump-
ing of a heart, the burrowing begins—•
one —two-three pumps and, unless it is
a very big pipi, the sand is bare with
no mark visible except the smallest of
depressions. The purplish, full-grown
pipi, however, is seldom washed up,
but a probing foot in the shallow water
or a scratching knife in the wet sand at
low tide will generally locate him. And
for tenacity of life when out of his ele-
ment he carries my money. Once, notic-
ing that the bait-bag was getting “high,”
I dumped the contents in the surf. Seven
or eight of the score of pipis were gap-
ing, obviously dead, but as the waves
whisked the other shells about I stared.
Two small, trunk-like members were
protruding from half a dozen. Within
a minute five had reached the bottoms-
up stage, two had done the disappearing
trick, and another three had their tongues
out. That after seventy-six hours in a
sugar-bag inside a hot tent!
* * * *
“Mat’s Mate”: The other side of
Tiega we were overtaken by a hard-
looking cove in an ancient car. “Want
work?” he asked. “Yair. What at?”
“Cuttin’ down big mallee.” “Where?”
“Hop in, I’ll show y’.” We hopped in
and were duly shown, “What are y’
offerin’?” asked Mat. “Thirteen bob,
not a penny more,” “We’ll do it fr
seventeen.” “Thirteen.” “Seventeen,” It
went on for nearly an hour. In the
midst of the deadlock the tight-looking
cove remarked, “Heavens above, I don’t
know what it’s cornin’ to. Few years
ago I could ha’ got it done f’r ten bob.”
“Yair,” said Mat, “an’ I s’pose y’ hung
orf, hopin’ for a coupler mugs to take
it on at eight. Now look what y’ve
done; y’ can’t get it done under seven-
teen. Few years more an’ it’ll be eight-
een bob or a quid.” It set him thinking,
all right, and we finally took it on at
15s. 9d., no charge for water or carriage
of tucker,

“Flathead”: Jimmy Small recently be-
came a life-member of “The Pinnies” by
declaring that on the previous afternoon
it had taken him three hours 25 minutes
to land a two-pound bream. The precis
of his story turned out to be fairly old —
hooked fish, broke line, cursed, baited
new line, accidentally hooked the broken
one, landed fish, cheftred, bought lottery-
ticket —but it brought other stories. Un-
disputed victor was Bert Johnson, who
claimed that while once drifting over
sand he fouled and snapped his line
on something weighty. Fishing later with
heavier tackle, he hooked it again, slowly
dragged it up and discovered the wisp
of his old line anchored to a derelict
Blucher boot. “While removing both
hooks,” he concluded, “the water in the
boot swished. Emptied it, Whiting—•
three and a half pounds if it weighed an
ounce.”
“O-t.”: Don’t see the force of “Argu-
mentative Mac’s” criticism about “knots
an hour” on the Murray (B. 4/2/’4B).
As for “ringing-down on engine-room
telegraphs,” our skipper rang down by
jerking a cord which pulled a 4in. engine-
nut up against an inverted plough-disc
—one jerk to start, two for slow, three
for full, four to stop. If he doesn’t like
that “two miles astern,” let him rewrite
the line to make it “two miles ahead”
and see how silly it looks. So long,
“Mac”; sorry you couldn’t stay.
CATHEDRAL.
Men truilt St. Mary’s long ago
Upon a low hill’s crown,
Where spacious parks and winding roads
And lawns and trees sweep down.
Queen’s Square is just across the way,
Macquarie-street is near,
There are no crowding offices
Or tall skyscrapers here.
St. Mary’s towers are beautiful,
Men see them far away;
Her chiming bells, melodious,
In hearts rare magic play;
The thunder of her organ notes
Sounds through the traffic’s din,
And worshippers will turn to her
And softly enter in.
St. Mary’s in the moonlight seems
Like something from the stars,
Not of the earth —too beautiful
Where imperfection mars
The works of man no matter how
His deep endeavor plods...
Down through the years St. Mary’s holds
A beauty that is God’s.
Between the city and the bay
St. Mary’s and her bells
Were set to be a sign to say,
“Herein true beauty dwells.”
So in the dawns and sunsets, too,
And in the moonlight sweet
St. Mary’s in her splendor stands
Where sky and Sydney meet.

The New Dips.
“J.R.D.”; An entirely new
technique will be required to
check-up on their merits and
shortcomings. Laboratory tests
are insufficient, so are field tests
on a limited scale. Both D.D.T.
and garnmexane are likely to re-
act in a number of ways that, if
tested on the same basis as
arsenical and phenylic dips, will
only result in inaccurate and mis-
leading findings.
Although D.D.T. and gam-
mexane dips are being marketed
and giving excellent results, users
must be prepared for modifica-
tion of present recommendations.
Research chemists, veterinarians
and manufacturers realise that
they are only on the threshold
and that they still have much to
learn of the behavior of these
new products, particularly when
they pass from the hands of
careful technicians into those of
station labor.
It has already been proved
that, when used in dipping fluids,
they are subject to “stripping,” a
formidable obstacle for the
chemist to counteract. It means
that so much of the active in-
gredient is absorbed by the
wool grease that after a few
hundred sheep are put through
the strength of the remaining
fluid may be far too low. Al-
though this has been counter-
acted in certain products, consid-
erable doubt exists about the
ability of other dips to sustain
their power to kill ticks and lice
throughout the normal dipping
life of a bath.
Another problem is how long
the dips will remain effective
after mixing with water. Dip-
ping may be spread over a long
period, and the usual procedure
is to discard the fluid only when
it is so soiled from droppings,
etc., and there is danger of stain-
ing the fleeces. Consequently,
the original bath may be topped
up over a number of days, and
during time all sorts of
chemical reactions may have
been occurring which may affect
the efficiency of the insecticide.
The new dips should be sub-
jected to a thorough and pro-
longed test. No doubt now exists
about their power to kill keds
and lice. For that they are
superior to any dip previously
used, and they remain potent in
the wool longer than any-other,
so that double-dipping should
no longer be necessary. Official
tests should be made on a mini-
mum of 2000 sheep at one dip-
ping—a larger number for pref-
erence. Only thus will it be
found whether the dipping fluid
retains its potency. Unless they
are thoroughly reliable and fool-
proof from the start, the new
dips, which offer better prospects
in the control of external para-
sites than anticipated, will come
in for some hard knocks and
bad advertisement. One sub-
standard product may damage
the reputation of others.
Worth Examining.
“Teg”: Lambing percentages
in certain areas around Cunna-
mulla (Q.) are the envy of pastor-
alists all over Australia. One
well-known property in that dis-
trict has averaged 104 p.c. over
a period of 20 years, while 95-
100 p.c. is quite common. The
area of high fertility is said to
be confined to a strip about 150-
200 miles wide on the Q’ld. side
of the border. Local graziers
attribute the phenomenon to the
excellent variety of feed and
abundant water supply, but in
other equally-favored areas in
N.S.W. and Q’ld. no such re-
sults are obtainable. The matter
would seem to merit investiga-
tion by the C.S.I.R. —no
one seems to know just what
peculiarities of soil, climate and
pasture are responsible for such
prolific lambings.
Soil-Erosion
“Archaps”: According to a
report to Queensland Lands De-
partment, it was viewed as a
relatively minor problem in the
area of south-western Queens-
land bounded on the east by the
Condamine and on the west by
the Balonne, much of this land
being relatively level, well
timbered and reasonably well
grassed. Local information,
however, indicates that water-
holes in the Balonne have be-
come shallower by as much as
6ft. to Bft. in 20 years.
In the far west erosion con-
cerns (a) the sand-dune area, ( b )
the hard lateritic mulga ridges
of the river basins and (c) the
open Mitchell-grass downs. The
value of the sandhill country is
too low to warrant expenditure
on anti - erosion engineering
works, and the only practicable
control is to limit stocking. The
higher “red” country of ( b ) is
liable, during drought, to de-
terioration by gully erosion; it
is often impracticable to move
starving stock, which gradually
remove all vestiges of feed. This
land, also, does not warrant en-
gineering works, but some
owners are recovering claypans
as a spare-time job. In the vast
areas of cretaceous “downs”
soil carrying Mitchell grass,
north of a line joining Auga-
thella and Bedourie, many
waterholes are being silted up,
but action to control erosion
there is limited by economic fac-
tors, During otherwise dry
periods these areas are liable to
sheet and gully erosion by heavy
thunderstorms. The Lands De-
partment report emphasises the
need “for a more general recog-
nition of the intimate relation-
ship between the conservation of
soil and the conservation and
planned use of other natural re-
sources, particularly water and
forests.”
Teaching the Colt.
“Wirrameju”: If your colt has
been taught to be caught in the
proper way, and no longer
hangs back on his rope when
“I said two and a quarter —not two and a half!"
tied up, the chances are that he
won’t need to be taught to lead
at all. However, there are stub-
born colts and four means
of teaching them.
Put the headstall on, and then
tie the neckrope firmly round
his neck and pass the loose end
through the lower part of the
noseband. Go to the extremity
of the rope and maintain a
steady pull on it, at the same
time flicking him behind the
knees with your whip. Don’t
belt him ; just flick him insist-
ently. After a while he will tire
of this and take a step forward.
Work on alternate legs as each
comes forward, ordering him at
the same time to “come on.”
He will soon know what is re-
quired of him, and the order
and steady pull on the rope will
be enough. As soon as he has
leached this stage, make him
move faster until you can run
round the yard with him trot-
ting behind—you may want to
catch a sheep with him one day.
If this method fails, go about
it the same way as you would
in teaching him to be caught—
adjust headstall and rope and
keep moving to • his rear, and
cracking the whip behind him
so that he keeps slacking the
rope all the time. Don’t give
him any slack, or he might de-
cide to whirl round in the oppo-
site direction.
Those are the best methods.
These alternatives are not recom-
mended except in extreme cases.
For the first, put a bridle and
bradoon bit on him, two long
ropes round his neck, each lead-
ing out through a bit-ring, i.e.,
one on near-side, one on off-side.
A man on each rope stands well
back and directly at right-angles
to his line. Each man in turn
gives a violent pull so that the
colt responds first to one side,
then the other. Soon he will
come easily to one side, and will
probably lead in a halting
manner. I dislike it; but where
an unbroken colt has to be led
home, it is handy.
The second alternative is to
place bridle and bit on him, and
with it a long thin rope Hin.
diameter, 25ft. long). Pass this
through the near bit-ring, over
the back, under his buttocks or
tail (like a crupper) over his
back again and through the off-
side bit-ring, so that both ends
are held in the hand. A jerk on
this usually startles the colt into
jumping forward and leading.
(The same rigging is put to
better use in curing a horse
which habitually hangs on his
neck-rope when tied up.) The last
resort is a relic from the old
“make ’em or break ’em” days
and ways. Get the strongest
halter to be had in the State, put
it on your colt, tie the end to the
back of the truck or any horse-
drawn vehicle and drive off. It
will teach him to lead, but this
method probably begat half the
“head-sensitive” colts in Aus-
tralia.
Remember you are “gentling”
your colt, not “breaking” him.
Bossing the Bull.
“Curlew”: A neighbor had a
good bull-paddock but a very
bad bull which kept getting
loose. The bull had a ring in
his nose, but that was only an
ornament, though useful for
handling purposes. Then two
pieces of galvanised-wire were
attached to the ring and the four
ends bent to form the flukes of
an anchor. And anchored he
was. It seemed dangerous hav-
ing to unhook him, but the ring
teaches a bull some manners.
Eventually, however, a broad
strap was passed around the
horns. A light stick about 3ft.
long by iin. square had a couple
of light iron pins 4in. long
spaced 9in. apart on the upper
front end. The stick was secured
to the ring. Through a loop in
the centre of the strap across the
forehead the stick was held in
position, and could slide up and
down a bit. If the bull put his
head through the fence, the stick
engaged on a wire and put a
strain on the ring so that the
animal thought better of it. He
causes no trouble now.
Stationary Car Engine.
“Oiler”: A car engine, over-
hauled and mounted on a suit-
able block, will give perform-
ance equal to its b.h.p. as a
stationary motor. The gearbox,
clutch, fan and radiator are
stripped off in the set-up de-
scribed, which has proved itself
capable of taking the strain of
heavy loads. A 44-gallon drum
takes the place of radiator, with
the hoses fitted on in like
fashion ; the fan-blades are re-
moved as unnecessary and likely
to prove dangerous.
The flywheel is retained, hav-
ing a shaft with flanged end
bolted, on at the end of the
crankshaft. Shaft should be
long enough to take fast and
loose pulleys, and a bearing at
the end to guard against strain

Table Poultry for Britain.
“Vautier”: By supplying
Australian producers with a
continuous supply of chicks
from mass-incubation centres,
the British market can be
assured of regular supplies of
table poultry. Chicks can be
prepared for marketing in from
12 to 16 weeks.
There are thousands of pro-
ducers in Victoria alone pre-
pared to fatten chicks for ex-
port. Arrangements are already
in hand for a supply of day-old
chicks from existing suppliers, a
start can be made and within
six months from date of starting
large supplies can be made avail-
able for export.
Each producer can handle
batches of 5000 and 6000 birds
triennially. Cost of equipment
per farm to produce (say) 15,000
birds per annum is estimated at
between £3OO and £4OO. The
capital would be provided by
forming each group into limited-
liability companies or co-opera-
tives. A group of 100 producers
each fattening 15,000 birds per
annum of an average weight of
31b. per bird could provide some
4,500,0001 b. of table poultry. At
2s. per lb. (a conservative price
for chickens) this represents a
turnover of £450,000 for each
group. This can be multiplied
throughout the Commonwealth.
Arrangements for the supply
of feed in bulk could be made
through State Agricultural De-
partments. Prior to the war
Great Britain spent some
£12,000,000 per annum on im-
ported table poultry from foreign
countries. This vast sum could
be diverted to Australia.
Markets in other countries could
be exploited later if shipping
space is available.
Cutting Corrugated-Iron.
“Prof”; “Perseverando’s” hint
for cutting corrugated-iron (B.
31/12/’47) really works, and as
he says, “the wire will cut the
iron like a hot knife going
through butter.” However, it is
impossible to cut perfectly
straight, and the cut edges are
irregular and bent, while the
trampling necessary to hold the
iron down flattens out the corru-
gations.
Bush carpenters and the like
in my locality use an old wood
saw to do the job. The iron is
raised! on to boxes with the part
to be cut projecting just over
one edge. If is then clamped
down and held rigid with a piece
of sawn timber as long as the
proposed cut held on the iron
with one knee. Make a nick
with the tinsnips to start the
cut, then saw quickly, keeping it
going all the time until right
through. I have also seen a
spade used for cutting corru-
gated- and plain-iron. A corner
of the spade is driven into the
iron on the line of the proposed
cut and the edge of the spade
then levered through the iron.
The spade is then moved along,
and the edge again pressed
through from one corner.
Hints far the Farm.
“E. 2”: Cabbage, cauliflower
and others of the ilk require rich
soil and should be kept growing.
Fresh manure may be used, pro-
vided it is not given too liberally
and the ground watered copi-
ously. Best growth I’ve seen was
when fowl manure from below
the roost was watered into the
soil at weekly intervals. Dwarfed
plants are the result of a check
in growth, and such vegetables
haven’t the quality of quickly-
grown ones. Where winters are
cold it’s a good plan to have a
crop coming to heart for that
season. They won’t run to seed
for several months and frosts
improve the texture and flavor.
“Sundowner”: Cockchafer
grubs in lawns can be dealt with
by dusting with lead-arsenate
powder using ilb. per 100 sq. ft.
or 51b. per 1000 sq. ft. mixed with
a bushel of soil slightly mois-
tened. After 24 hours hose the
grass to wash off the poison.
D.D.T. at the rate of 20 p.c.
gives satisfactory results.
“Bogan Joe”; For a drinking
basin take an old combine wheel,
cut out the spokes and place an
inch or so of concrete in the
base. It will not, leak, is too
heavy for stock to kick over and
low enough for all, even fowls,
to drink from.
“W. Court”: The old kerosene
emulsion is just as good for beat-
ing fowl-lice as it is for horse
parasites (B. 21/ l/’4B). Use a
strong force-pump to drive it
into every crevice, and no fowl-
ticks, lice or scaly-leg mites have
a chance of survival. If left un-
disturbed, these parasites will
rapidly increase and reduce egg
production. Furthermore, if the
henhouse is handy to the home-
stead, the fowl-lice will enter the
house.
“R.N.”: Amendments to the
Stock Act in Tasmania make the
branding of sheep optional in-
stead of compulsory. The use
of tar, pitch or paint is pro-
hibited, the brand must not ex-
ceed 4in. by Sin. and the brander
must be of metal not more than
three-sixteenths inch in diameter.
Only Australian State in which
branding is compulsory is New
South Wales, though E. H.
Graham, Minister of Agricul-
ture, has promised legislation
providing for optional branding.
“C.S.”: - A Swan Hill (Vic.)

relief on 160 acres of wheat

without emphasis, and are essential
to the humor, dialogue and drama
of the story. They may be passed
for general exhibition if sufficiently
slurred to go over the heads of
children. They will be deleted, how-

Horse Sense.
“Horsebreeders in the Soviet Re-
public of Uzbek are seeking to de-
velop the fastest horse in the world
by crossing the Russian horse with
the wild Mongolian donkey.'
It was Joe who first drew the
Politburo’s attention at a secret
meeting to the need for speedier
Russian horses.
It has long been the proud
boast of Russian military
leaders that throughout history
the retreats they have ordered
have been bigger, better and
faster than those of any other
army in the world. It had
therefore come as a mortifying
blow to Joe to discover a sad
fact when browsing through his
Russian history one day.
Here he had read that on
at least seven other occa-
sions Russian Imperial
armies had set speeds
up to 20 miles a day faster
than the Red Army had
done on the occasion of
“stop wriggling, Ronnie, or you'll break the needle!”
his quondam pal Hitler’s in-
vasion. Obviously the reason
lay in the deterioration of the
equine standard.
Determined that were the
warmongering Western Demo-
cracies to attack the peace-loving
U.S.S.R., they would have to
turn on super-speeds to catch the
Red Army, Joe and his Polit-
buro gave orders for the evolu-
tion of horseflesh that would be
capable of giving the fastest
Anglo-American tank 10' yards
in a hundred while burdened
with a bullock-wagon.
The Turf Commissar had
rubbed his hands in glee at the
decision. Perhaps he could
clean up on the English and
Kentucky Derbies or the Mel-
bourne Cup with one of the
Soviet superhorses.
Contrary to belief outside the
Curtain, horseracing is allowed
in the U.S.S.R. Not, of course,
for the happy toilers in the
Paradise, for if some of them
were to win a wad they would,
in the words of an obscure near-
comrade in some far barbaric
country, become “little capi-
talists.” But it was a flourish-
ing industry enjoyed by the
specially privileged 7,000,000
commissars, party members.
bureaucrats and secret police,
who always explained that they
amassed their fortunes from
horseracing, even though the
bookmakers seemed still to
flourish.
The consequent work of the
Manager of the Collectivised
Stud Farm in Uzbek, M. Beli-
bandski, was followed with in-
tense interest by the Kremlin.
The first progeny of the cross
was a wonder. As the Mon-
golian donkey has a beard and
hair reaching to the ground, its
colt had the appearance of a
large hairy goat—and not only
the appearance, as the Commis-
sar sourly remarked when he
saw it race.
In the first furlong it tripped
six times over the long hair
streaming from what looked
vaguely like its fetlocks. This
was remedied by an application
of a blowlamp that really
worked.
Notwithstanding that its long
ears kept getting caught in the
barrier, ij was felt in Soviet
racing circles that with the aid
of a strong battery it might still
beat all Russian turf records by
doing the mile in 2\ minutes.
Unfortunately, at its first trial
over six furlongs, the super
horse-donk stopped dead in its
tracks after doing two furlongs
in 38, and it took five champion
heavyweight wrestlers half an
hour to shift it while it kept up
a maddening barrage of “Hee-
haws, hee-haws.”
Put in one of the Red Army’s
latest streamlined, light-iron-
tyred bullock-wagons, one of
the new horse-donks, after hav-
ing a fire lit under it, easily beat
a Sherman tank that had been
thieved from the Americans.
This performance, however, was
viewed in military circles with
no great optimism, for the tank
had been serviced for a year by
Soviet mechanics.
One day M. Belibandski was
pondering how he could elimi-
nate the “interfering” which was
one of the minor defects of his
new horse-donk when the dis-
trict O.G.P.U. commander
came to the Collectivised Stud
Farm with a firing-party, col-
lectivised the manager and
parked him against a suitable
wall. As they were taking aim
M. Belibandski, greatly daring,
asked what the trouble was.
The O.G.P.U. man regarded
him sternly. “You informed
the press you hoped to breed
the world’s fastest horse,” he
said icily, “and the statement
was broadcast to the world. You
should know that everything the
Fatherland has is already better
than what anybody else in the
world has. You are therefore
guilty of grave anti-Soviet
propaganda. Squad, fire! ”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid

A Sheet of Iron
Three months ago I applied for a sheet
of corrugated-iron. Hoping that it might
be “in,” I recently dropped in to the hard-
ware-store. “Sorry,” I was told. “Not a
bit of iron in the place.” “What do you
call that?” I asked, pointing to a huge
pile of the stuff at the back. “Don’t
mention that,” the shopkeeper snorted.
Apparently a nearby dairyman had
ordered the iron more than a year ago
to roof his new cowbails, the old ones
having been condemned. His new
bails were complete with cement floors
and all the trimmings—everything,
in fact, except the roof. The dairy in-
spector paid him a visit and immediately
wrote to Labor and Industry to hurry up
the corrugated-iron.
By some weird process known only to
L. and I. the material duly arrived,
but at a different hardware-store. Fol-
lowing closely came a second lot of iron,
this time to the .first hardware-shop.
L. and I. threatened the protesting
farmer with dire penalties and made him
take the first consignment. That left my
hardware-merchant with roughly £ 100-
worth of corrugated-iron on his hands.
Nine months later it is still there—he is
forbidden to sell a sheet of it.
Meanwhile I have a most unpleasant
leak in my roof, while all over the district
people trying to build homes are clamor-
ing for corrugated-iron. —Mac (N.S.W.).
Soldiers
“Ole Bill” (B. 21 /1 / ’4B) is certainly an
old campaigner, but he overlooks
one important thing. Most of those
joining the present Australian Regular
Army are not the veterans who
won their spurs at Tobruk, Shaggy
Ridge, Balikpapan and many other proud
memories of the Second A.I.F. They
are mainly young men who, sick of the
humdrum of Australian life, are joining
a show where they do not have to think
and where everything is provided.
The dinkum soldier will never join the
“perms.” It’s too slow, inactive and
routine for him, and he probably can get
more adventure in civil life if he looks
for it.
The food ration of the Old Contemp-
tibles was much the same as we received
in New Guinea jungle—except ours was
dropped from the air instead of arriving
by packhorse. For two months I had
dog-biscuits, cheese and bully-beef—and
felt much better than I do today.
The Old Contemptibles were “big-time”
in their day, but no bigger than the men
of the A.I.F. who saved Australia from
the Japs.— Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.).
S.P. Betting
A North Queenslander was recently
fined £5O for keeping a “common gaming
house” ; since 1946 the same gentleman
has contributed no less than £250 to the
State Treasury for the same offence.
The fine has always been £5O, which
dispels any idea that it was inflicted as
a deterrent. No increase has been made
with each succeeding offence, and the
regularity of the raids, coupled with the
names of the small number of deadbeats
(£3 per head) caught on the premises, is
very, very strange.
Obviously the law can never put down
off-the-course betting, and the method of
extracting “rent” by regular raids is so
obvious that even the veriest dullard is
aware of it.
Surely a State which sanctions the
Golden Casket, makes it impossible to
walk through the main street of its capi-
tal without having to run the gauntlet of
chocolate-wheels and “art-unions” for
every deserving and undeserving cause
under the sun, and which, until recent
years, ran regular “Bingo” games for
the A.L.P., can see its way morally

Macquarie Rediscovered
Perhaps the most important conse-
quence of the publication of M. H. Ellis’s
Lachlan Macquarie is that the daily news-
papers have rediscovered Macquarie.
Headings such as “Australia’s Greatest
Governor” adorning the reviews of Ellis’s
book are, perhaps, an even more potent
stimulus to the re-evaluation of Macquarie
than the book itself. Mr. Ellis should
feel gratified that he has educated the
Australian daily press into consideration
of some greatness outside that of race-
horses, athletes and financiers.
The next step, one hopes, is that the
writers of school text-books will be re-
educated by Mr. Ellis—a sensible sug-
gestion is that Mr. Ellis himself might
prepare a shorter and simpler school-text,
presenting in broad outline the story he
has so painstakingly pieced together in
detail.
The “Bligh hiding under the bed”
legend is slowly dying; the “vain Mac-
quarie” legend has received its death-
blow from Mr. Ellis, and when his esti-
mate of Macquarie’s character and im-
portance reaches the popular mind an-
other vital , aspect of early Australian
development will come into its true per-
spective. Macquarie’s greatness was
clouded for many years by the adulation
poured upon his bitter, self-seeking
enemy, John Macarthur, both through
the newspapers and by snob litterateurs.
The restatement of the true significance
of Macquarie, both as a man and in rela-
tion to his period, is the most welcome
addition to Australian source-literature in
a long time. It is unfortunate that the
price puts it beyond the reach of the
average man’s bookshelf. No doubt
“Well, if you doan Want ’em I'll give ’em to Wirths!”
cheap editions will follow ; certainly they
should.
Macquarie was not only a great Gov-
ernor—he was an authentic statesman, a
rare figure in a country which has more
than enough politicians. Mr. Ellis’s book
clearly, if unintentionally, reveals how
wide is the gap between the statesman
and mere politicians. In Macquarie’s day
Parliament as an institution did not exist
in Australia, but if it had it is not diffi-
cult to see Macquarie as a towering, if
turbulent, figure in it.—W. D. (N.S.W.).
Pilots
I can’t believe that the school for blind-
flying at Hullavington (England) can be
classed as an example of advance in
specialised training (B. 21/1 /’4B).
For five years the R.A.F. had to pay
me for services rendered and I have never
heard of a “clear-weather” pilot—we
called them “fair-weather” pilots, and
it had nothing to do with ability. During
my “sprog period” all of us had to do
about an hour’s Link Trainer per week,
plus a similar time under the hood in the
air. This training included blind tri-
angular cross-country trips with another
pupil or, if collaboration was suspected,
an instructor. On the Link we practised
various beam approaches, both old and
new, and generally became conversant
with the Sperry instrument-panel.
I can’t remember how many hours we
had on both types, but it was
well in excess of “five hours on instru-
ments or two on instruments and eight
hours under simulated black conditions.”
The reference to “rough exercises” is
enough to make the old pilots of ’39 and
’4O groan in disgust.
It is a waste of time and money to send
“R.A.A.F. delegates” across to the school,
as there are flying men in this country
who would be more than pleased to teach
the newcomers all that they can learn on
“blind-flying.” At 26, I may be old-
fashioned, but ip is possible to overtrain
a man.
A pilot should be allowed, as far as
possible, to work things out for himself.
Initiative is the operative word. Flying
with a night-fighter squadron in the
Western Desert we had 19 crashes in 22
days, all of them pilots who had attended
the various schools and courses that had
sprung up since the days of ’4O and ’41.-
They had been taught to use every known
aid to n.f., but on arriving on ops they
were hopeless. We landed by the light of
the moon, when it was up, and by a
very dim flarepath when it was down.
No floodlight—that attracted the Hun.
The point I want to make is that all
of us “old codgers” battled through with-
out specialised training, taking conditions
as they cropped up, and there were no
crashes, major or minor. There is no
teacher like experience, and the more
“procedures” that are crammed into a
man the less able he is to handle the un-
expected.—Landsdowne-Wynde (Q.).
Why Not?
“Being an agreement between a free
citizen of the Commonwealth of Aus-
tralia and the elected Democratic Gov-
ernment thereof, whereas I, William John
Brown, being of sane mind, and re-
siding at 20 Optimum-avenue, Ballyhoey,
in the State of Victoria, do agree to
accept as my due wages and weekly re-
ward the sum of Eight Pounds per week,
free of all taxes and dues at my occupa-
tion of Barnacle-stripper, instead of the
Ten Pounds taxable wages I now receive
and further agree that I shall furnish an
annual statement of any moneys received
over and above the aforesaid tax-free
reward.”
And why not? Such an agreement or
permit would benefit all and sundry.
The employee would know his real
wages, the employer would be relieved
of extra responsibilities and worry ; taxa-
tion staffs would have less work, and
less paper, fewer stamps and fewer
records would be wasted on non-pro-
ductive business. —M. W. (A.C.T.).
Private Enterprise
“Sceptic” (B. 12/11 /’47) is all theory
and no practice. He wants Governments
to stop interfering with industry because
the ordinary Australian is fully capable
of dealing with all problems as they arise
and can do it far better. All the evidence
goes to prove just the opposite—that de-
prived of Government interference (i.e.,
assistance) Australia would starve.
“S.” wants Australia to emulate
America, where, so he says, the Adminis-
tration concerns itself only with utilities
like power and highways. So he says.
Who found the billions of dollars to
build airports and internal waterways
and to run uneconomic foreign-going
ships?
In Australia, how much wheat or
butter, wool or beef would be produced
without this “interference”? How long
would Leigh Creek (S.A.) or Mt. Isa (Q.)
continue to operate if suddenly deprived
of assistance? How much transport
would there be had private enterprise
been left to build the railways, roads and
airfields? Even coastal shipping, the last
stronghold of individualism, has now
been reduced to operating on a Govern-
ment dole.
The truth of the matter is that, in a
world where all laws of economics have
gone by the board, undiluted private
enterprise is a thing of the past and in-
dustry can, or will in the very near future,
operate only with Government assistance.
And Governments which pay the piper
without having a large say in the choice
of the tune are not of this world. —
Tidapa (Singapore),
Land Values
After an agreement between the Chifley
and Hanlon Governments, an Act en-
titled “The War Service Land Acquisition
Act” was proclaimed and became opera-
tive in 1945. It provides that the value
of land taken by the State Government in
Queensland for soldier-settlement shall
be paid for at a value not higher than it
could have been sold for in 1942.
If, however, the same Government re-
sumes land for any public purpose other
than soldier-settlement, a dispossessed
owner is entitled to compensation based
on present-day values.
It now takes about one-third more
capital than it did in 1942 to yield an
equal interest return. It follows that dis-
possessed owners whose land is taken for
soldier-settlement are being arbitrarily
deprived of about one-third of its real
Value, and no one can blame them for
objecting. Many of them are old soldiers
of 1914-18 who have striven hard to
build up profitable holdings.—W. E. A.
(Q-).
Stage and Screen
Last year, audiences at legitimate
theatres increased 300 per cent., both in
England and America, while “live”
theatres in Australia packed their houses
nightly. One stage show in Melbourne
is now in its second year.
Making the most of the film industry’s
relapse, stage companies are setting a
higher standard of production and bring-
ing the world’s best artists to Australia.
Already a large proportion of the best
film-“stars” have returned to the legiti-
mate theatre. That alone is hastening a
deterioration in films.
Australian theatre combines should
study the gradual but certain move away
from the celluloid and have more legiti-
mate theatres. Conversion costs would
be comparatively small. —W. W. (Vic.).
Root of the Matter
In 1940 the number of cars in use by
Government officials in the N.T. was 79.
Today, according to figures released by
the Department of the Interior, the total
number of official cars in use in the
Territory is 1245. These require a large
maintenance staff, and the amount of
petrol used reaches staggering figures.
Taxpayers foot the bill, of course. —
Territorian (N.T.).
The American war cemetery at Rook-
wood (N.S.W.) was a very beautiful place
and a credit to those responsible for it.
Since the bodies of American servicemen
have been exhumed, the polished brown
granite entrance pillars and the splendid
granite centre column have been removed.
It seems a pity that the little area was
not left as an Australian memorial park
to the American servicemen who were
buried there for a short time. —W. P. T.
(N.S.W.).
I took a walk last Saturday morning to
see what effect the 40-hour week has had
on pedestrian traffic in the city. By all
hotels were crowds of men earnestly dis-
cussing prospects for the races; the bars
were full and the barmaids busy. The
city paths were never so crowded with
“workers,” but oddly enough little more
than ordinary business was being done
where things like lawnmowers and spades
were on sale. There were more husbands
waiting outside shops than formerly, and
scores of women and children in door-
ways and corners were licking ice-creams.
The question is not why shouldn’t they,
but can Australia afford it? Or is' it just
a case of “bread and circuses” to make
people forget their ills? — Bill Ding
(W.A.).
Tea is used in almost every household
in Australia, but must be imported rather
than grown in any of our suitable dis-
tricts. The total cost to the consumer isn’t
fully realised, since we get it at half-price
through the benevolence of a Govern-
ment subsidy. Of course the people pro-
vide the money for this lefthanded means
of keeping the price down. It was once
maintained that tea couldn’t be grown
profitably here, but times have changed.
At five-bob a pound it should be worth
considering as a commercial crop. —
X. E. D. (Vic.).
One effect of the 40-hour week will be
less work for those “trades” which call
for little or no skill but demand fancy
wages—painting, for instance. The old-
time painter, like his contemporary
carpenter, was a craftsman who learned
his trade the hard way ; his modern suc-
cessor is little more than a glorified
laborer. Anyone of reasonable intelli-
gence can paint his own house, so what
man of moderate means will pay a 1948
painter £lO a week to do the job?—
Dutigalla (Vic.).

The Industrial “Spinning Wheel”
It is a far cry from the craft of the old spinning wheel to the organised industries of to-day.
But it symbolises the amazing industrial development that has been made possible in
Australia by the enterprise, foresight and practical backing of important financial
organisations.
The Metropolitan is proud of the assist-
ance that it has rendered to Australia’s
secondary industries. Their continued
development will make for healthy
expansion, prosperity and full employ-
ment; and the Metropolitan’s financial
backing will continue towards that
objective.
By effecting your Assurances with the
Metropolitan you are linking up with
an old established progressive Office,
and at the same time supporting Aus-
tralian Industry.
