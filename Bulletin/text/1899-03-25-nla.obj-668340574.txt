The Song of the Sword.
(To Rudyard Kipling.)
The Sword
Singing —
The voice of the Sword from the heart of the Sword
Clanging imperious
Forth from Time's battlements
His ancient and triumphing Song.
In the beginning,
Ere God inspired himself
Into the clay thing
Thumbed to His image,
The vacant, the naked shell
Soon to be Man :
Thoughtful He pondered it,
Prone there and impotent,
Fragile, inviting
Attack and discomfiture :
Then, with a smile —
As He heard in the Thunder
That laughed over Eden
The voice of the Trumpet,
The iron Beneficence,
Calling his dooms
To the Winds of the world—•
Stooping, He drew
On the sand with his finger
A shape for a sign
Of his way to the eyes
That in wonder should waken
For a proof of His will
To the breaking intelligence.
That was the birth of me :
1 am the Sword. . . .
I am the feast-maker :
Hark, through a noise
Of the screaming of eagles,
Hark how the Trumpet,
The mistress of mistresses,
Calls, silver-throated
And stern, where the tables
Are spread, and the meal
Of the Lord is at hand !
Driving the darkness,
Even as the banners
And spears of the Morning }
Sifting the nations,
The slag and the metal, *
The waste and the weak
From the fit and the strong j
Fighting the brute,
The abysmal Fecundity;
Checking the gross,
Multitudinous blunders,
The groping, the purblind
Excesses in service
Of the Womb universal,
The absolute drudge;
Firing the charaetry
Carved on the World,
The miraculous gem
In the seal-ring that burns
On the hand of the Master-
Yea ! and authority
Flames through the dim,
Unappeasable Grisliness
Prone down the nethermost
Chasms of the Void !
Clear singing, clean slicing;
Sweet spoken, soft finishing ;
Making death beautiful,
Life but a coin
To be staked in the pastime
Whose playing is more
Than the transfer of. being ;
Arch-anarch, chief builder,
Prince and evangelist,
I am the Will of God :
I am the Sword.
The Sword
Singing —
The voice of the Sword from the heart of the Sword
Clanging majestical,
As from the starry -staired
Courts of the primal Supremacy,
His high, irresistible song.
HERE is the rugged, careless, jolly, oyni-
cal face of William Ernest Efenley—
Henley, the writer of verses, of plays
(with Stevenson), of articles, of criti-
cism of literature and art; Henley, the lover of
naughty things and naughty words, collaborator
with J. S. Farmer in an unfinished slang dietion-
ary; Henley, editor of the Magazine of Art, editor
of the Scots (National) Observer, the most brilliant
weekly of its epoch— too brilliant, alas ! to live ;
editor of the New Review, dead also, killed by
British Philistinism; editor, too, of Burns and a
bit of Byron (pray he live to complete it!); Hen-
ley, the keeper and courager of young lions,, with
T.k eye f° r talent, welcoming Kipling, Charles
Whibley, Marriott Watson, and shouting their
praises m the market-place till the sleepy
public turned, and wondered—and bought ;
Henley, crippled in his youth, now sadly fading in
his sere, yet opposing a brave heart (if a grumpy
temper) to the tide of illness and trouble ; Henley,
pensioned by the Government, crowned by the
Academy , hated by the Common Burnsites and
the crowd of small scribblers for whom (as bal-
ancing his enthusiasms) he has never scrupled to
show contempt, beloved and exalted by his friends
(these of the best and worthiest) beyond all other
mei VT( n a word ’ kIKNLKY, giving literature many
good things, stimulating many better, an English-
man from 1840. a writer, a man, and a brother.
* • *
For the permanency of his name and fame
Henley relies on his poems, and unluckily his
poems are no better than clever man’s verses—or
say very clever man’s verses. What is it, this
mysterious something that, for all minds tuned to
it, so distinctly sets apart poetry from verse?
One does not know—it is indefinable— an influence
subtilising, clarifying, suddenly piercing the veil
’twixt you and the Poet and setting you tingling
at his will. One does not know —Henley has
heat enough and light enough, yet somehow from
his furnace of passion, thought, phrase, image,
there does not arise that white flame which vivifies
all it leaps upon. He is like~those alchemists
who, with all the ingredients, vainly sought the
elixir, panting for the incommunicable secret of
the combination. So Kipling. So Buchanan. So
Stevenson. So a dozen other men of noble impulse,
of high capacity, with the fullest knowledge of what
they seek, the models and precedents at their fingers’
ends, the hot stir at their hearts —yet unable to
crystallise, impotent to create. And comes along
some rude, unlettered rogue of a ballad-maker,
with not a tithe of their learning or of their talents
—a touch, and the thing’s done ! A word added
or deducted, or a relationship taken or given, and
10, a Poem ! One does not know—it is some mys-
tery of the molecules. But the results are as
clearly divided as the sheep from the goats of the
legendary Judgment-Day. Henley writes—
Stoop to my endeavor,
O my love, and be
Only and for ever
Sun and stars to me.
That ia verse. And an unknown Australian
Writes—
Love, love me only,
Love me for ever,
My life’s been lonely,
A joyless endeavor.
Though earth were heaven,
I in it for ever,
Of thee bereaven
I’d love again never.
That is poetry. And Henley writes—
Kate-a-Whimsies, John-a-Dreams,
Still debating, still delay,
And the world’s a ghost that gleams—
Wavers—vanishes away !
We must live while live we can ;
We should love while love we may.
Dread in women, doubt in man . . .
So the Infinite runs away.
That is verse. And an unknown woman in Para-
guay writes—
We did not think, did we ?
Love had us in his net.
Now we may not remember,
Nor yet may we forget.
That is poetry. And so on. In Henley’s boo c
there is a verse—
O, Falmouth is a fine town with ships in the bay,
And I wish from my heart it’s there I was to-day ;
I wish from my heart I was far away from here,
Sitting in my parlour and talking to my dear.
Then comes the refrain—
For it’s home, dearie, home—it’s home I want to be.
Our topsails are hoisted, and we’ll away to sea.
0, the oak and the ash and the bonnie birken tree
They ’re all growing green in the old countree.
The verse (which is Henley’s) is verse: the refrain
(which is not Henley’s) is poetry. The differenc
ns not as wide as a church-door, but it serves
Henley was thrilled by the old burthen ; possibly
he felt it as fully as the old writer ; but he coulc
not match it for the life of him. He has all th
imagination, the power of invention, expression
that is needed, but he cannot get the freshness
the spontaneity, the natural magic. So with al
the verse-writers who are—and are not—poets
They better the luckless rascal in the Arabian
tale, and never dream of crying “ Open barley !
when they should cry ‘‘Open sesame!” Thev
have the right words, and the right watchword
and still that abominable door does not open.
* • * •
It must be Art which comes between us anc
Nature, giving freely, yet doubtfully giving a
much as site takes away. Our brains are stuffec
with impressions from books, teased and janglec
with the hurries and worries of “civilisation,” anc
we cannot regain the clean sight and sense of our
youth: if we could, the fatigue of the laden
centuries bars us from regaining the ample vision
of the youth of Nature.
Who can see the green earth any more
As she was by the sources of Time 1 /
Who imagines her fields as they lay
In the sunshine, unworn by the plough?
Who thinks as they thought,
The tribes who then roamed on her breast,
Her vigorous, primitive sons?
What girl
Now reads in her bosom as clear
As Rebekah read, when she sate
At eve by the palm-shaded well ?
Who guards in her breast
As deep, as pellucid a spring
Of feeling, as tranquil, as sure ?
What bard,
At the height of his vision, can deem
Of God, of the world, of the soul,
With a plainness as near,
As flashing as Moses felt
When he lay in the night by his flock
On the starlit Arabian waste?
Can rise and obey
The beck of the Spirit like him ?
This tract which the river of Time
Now flows through with us, is the plain.
Gone is the calm of its earlier shore.
Border’d by cities and hoarse
With a thousand cries is its stream.
And we on its breast, our minds
Are confused as the cries which we hear,
Changing and shot as the sights which we see.
Henley’s book of verses, then, is a book of tours
de force and turns of sentiment. And, though he
rhythms and rhymes most variously and felici-
tously, and achieves remarkable successes of epi-
thet and phrase, his originality is confined to his
style : he gives no new outlook, suggests no new
thought. His voluble lightnings of language dazzle
the eye and ear, and,warmly light the fancy, but
do not penetrate to the farthest of the mind. Per-
haps this is the reason why Henley’s criticism in
“ Views and Reviews ”is so unhelpful. It is al-
ways clever ; it says many, true things in many
tine ways ; but it seems too much occupied with
externals, too little with intimates : it never
reaches the heart of the subject. Take his notice of
just-quoted Matthew Arnold, a poet who to many
men is the nearest and dearest companion of all.
“ In every page of Arnold, the poet, ” says Henley,
“there is something to return upon and admire
. . . how many of the rarer qualities of art and
inspiration are represented here, and here alone in
modern work ! ” This is true enough, hut it is an
empty statement when unsupported or unex-
plained, and Henley never makes it fuller. You
can say the same thing as truly of Heine, of
Pater, of Baudelaire—of a dozen 6th'-m, each in
his kind, but which kind? Henley doesu t say :
he goes on to praise “ the unique and unapproached
Balder Dead ” as Arnold’s chief poem. But it is
not: it is a narrative and descriptive poem, and
therefore doomed to be intrinsically unpoetical, aa
dealing with things which seem, outsides, not
things in themselves, thoughts, inmost meanings.
The poetic stimulus of “A Summer Night,”
or “The Buried Life” is far intenser than
any to be derived from “Balder Dead.” And
the lesson of his collected criticism is that Henley
cares more for the art and architecture of a piece
of verse or prose than for the mind-stuff at the
core of it: though this is certainly not the attitude
he took when editing Burns, or when writing that
Burns commentary as full of suggestion as some
of his earlier commentaries are barren.
• • « •
But enough—maybe too much—has been said in
drawback and qualification (to attempt to make
clear to readers, unversed in Henley, just where
Henley stands in literature, and why). It is
fairer to take the man at his own estimate—“ a
summer’s flower to the summer sweet, ” and to
acknowledge the hearty, breezy manliness of him ;
the charm of his tender moods and thei
force of his brave ones ; his versatile and most in-
genious craftsmanship ; the attraction of Bis
iconoclastic assaults on Philistine conventions, of
his frank return to Earth, his Pan-worship and
petticoat-worship. The unrhymed verses “In
Hospital ” hunted London vainly for a purchaser,
so dense are editors : as the samples on this page
show, they are curious, interesting, capital, yet
content with the lower claim of journalism
or a little better just fragments of life
caught fresh and coloured vigorously on the
canvas. Yet to catch even one moment, or one
mood, and picture it finally, is no mean thing.
Henley has succeeded with many moments, many
moods. His “ Arabian Nights Entertainments ”
ns a brilliant reconstruction of the Romance of
Boyhood, with the most dexterous of verbal ad-
juncts and artifices, telling of the dear days when
Every lone Hillside
Mijfht open upon Elf-Land, every Stalk
That curled about a Beanstick was of the breed
Of that live ladder by whose delicate rungs
You climbed beyond the clouds, and found
The Farm-House where the Ogre, gorged
And drowsy, from his great oak chair,
Among the flitches and pewters at the fire,
Called for his Faery Harp.
“ The Song of the Sword ” (part here printed) ia
keyed on perhaps the highest note of emotion Hen-
ley has struck : there is. a fervour of appeal in it
to which he rarely rises.
• • • •
Henley admits a section of “Echoes ” into his
book; and indeed he is full of echoes. The
recently-quoted “Out of the night which covers
me ” almost good enough to be called grand, —has
perhaps something more than a comparative rela-
tion with Emily Bronte’s “The Old Stoic.”
Stevenson and Henley alike desire life to
roar to a full-flooded close—and which desired
first ? But Henley’s main themes—Life and
Death and Love (and Fight)—-are every-
body’s property : how can one avoid treading on
somebody’s footprint in a crowded street ? Perhaps
the most original, most characteristic Henley ap-
pears in pieces like that grim gallows-chant—
CARMEN PATIBULARE.
Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Crook
And the rope of the Black Election,
’Tis the faith of the Fool that a race you rule
Can never achieve perfection :
So, ‘ It’s O, for the time of the new Sublime
And the better than human way,
When the Rat (poor beast) shall come to his own
And the Wolf shall have his day !'
For Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Beam
And the power of provocation,
You have cockered the Brute with your dreadful fruit
Till your thought is mere stupration :
And ‘ It’s how should we rise to be pure and wise,
And how can we choose but fall,
So long as the Hangman makes us dread,
And the Noose floats free for all ? ’
So Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Coign
And the trick there’s no recalling,
They will haggle and hew till they hack you through
And at last they lay you sprawling :
When ‘ Hey ! for the hour of the race in flower
And the long good.-bye to sin ! ’
And ‘ Ho ! for the fires of Hell gone out
For thg want of keeping in ! ’
But Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Bough
And the ghastly Dreams that tend you,
Your growth began with the life of Man,
And only his death can end you.
They may tug in line at your hempen twine,
They may flourish with axe and saw ;
But your taproot drinks of the Sacred Springs
In the living rock of Law.
And Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Fork,
When the spent sun reels and blunders
Down a welkin lit with the flare of the Pit
As it seethes in spate and thunders,
Stern on the glare of the tortured air
Your lines august shall gloom,
And your m33ter-beam be the last thing whelmed
In the ruining roar of Doom.
* * « *
The same flavpur, heightened by thieves’ slang,
appears in these almost devilish (good) lines “To
W.R.”
Madam Life’s a piece in bloom
Death goes dogging everywhere :
She’s the tenant of the room,
He’s the ruffian on the stair.
You shall see her as a friend,
You shall bilk him once and twice ;
But lie ’ll trap you in ihe end,
And he’ll stick you for her price.
With his kneebones at your chest,
And his knuckles in your throat,
You would reason plead protest !
Clutching at her petticoat ;
But she’s heard it all before,
Well she knows you’ve had your fun,
Gingerly she gains the door,
And your little job is done.
How the writer has the air of rolling his sinister
symbol round his pen, with what luscious smack-
ing of lips, or thighs !

his ballades are superb. Some have been here

BALLADE.
MADE IN THE HOT WEATHER.
Fountains that frisk and sprinkle
The moss they overspill:
Pools that the breezes crinkle }
The wheel beside the mill,
With its wet, weedy frill;
Wind-shadows in the wheat ,
A water-cart in the street;
The fringe of foam that girds
An islet’s ferneries;
A green sky’s minor thirds—*
To live, I think of these !
Of ice and glass the tinkle,
Pellucid, silver-shrill ;
Peaches without a wrinkle ;
Cherries and snow at will,
From china bowls that fill
The senses with a sweet
Incuriousness of heat;
A melon's dripping sherds ;
Cream-clotted strawberries J
Dusk dairies set with curds—
To live, I think of these !
Vale-lily and periwinkle;
Wet stone-crop on the sill;
The look of leaves a-twinkle
With windlets clear and still;
The feel of a forest rill
That wimples fresh and fleet
About one’s naked feet;
The muzzles of drinking herds;
Lush flags and bulrushes ;
The chirp of rain-bound birds—
To live, I think of these !
Envoy.
Dark aisles, new packs of cards,
Mermaidens’ tails, cool swards.
Dawn dews and starlit seas,
White marbles, whiter words—

In Hospital.
BEFORE.
Behold me waiting—waiting for the knife.
A little while, and at a leap I storm
The thick, sweet mystery of chloroform,
The drunken dark, the little death-in-life.
The gods are good to me: I have no wife,
No innocent child, to think of as I near
The fateful minute ; nothing all-too dear
Unmans me for my bout of passive strife.
Yet am I tremulous and a trifle sick,
And, face to face with chance, I shrink a little:
My hopes are strong, my will is something weak.
Here comes the basket ? Thank you. lam ready.
But, gentlemen my porters, life is brittle :
You carry Caesar and his fortunes —steady !
OPERATION.
You are carried in a basket,
Like a carcase from the shambles,
To the theatre, a cockpit
Where they stretch you on a table.
Then they bid you close your eyelids,
And they mask you with a napkin,
And the anaesthetic reaches
Hot and subtle through your being.
And you gasp and reel and shudder
In a rushing, swaying rapture,
While the voices at your elbow
Fade—receding—fainter—farther.
Lights about you shower and tumble
And your blood seems crystallising—
Edged and vibrant, yet within you
Racked and hurried back and forward.
Then the lights grow fast and furious,
And you hear a noise of waters,
And you wrestle, blind and dizzy,
In an agony of effort,
Till a sudden lull accepts you,
And you sound an utter darkness . , .
And awaken . . . 'with a struggle . . ,
On a hushed, attentive audience.
NOCTURN.
At the barren heart of midnight,
When the shadow shuts and opens
As the loud flames pulse and flutter,
I can hear a cistern leaking.
Dripping, dropping, in a rhythm,
Rough, unequal, half-melodious,
Like the measures aped from nature
. In the infancy of music ;
Lik» the buzzing of an insect,
Still, irrational, persistent . . .
I must listen, listen, listen
In a passion of attention ;
Till it taps.upon my heartstrings,
And uiy V '.ry life gUes dripping,
Drpp]riug| dripping, drip-drip-dropping,
In the drip-drop of the cistern.

ATTENTION, PLEASE!
"V*7HY are the Preparations manufactured by E. HOL-
VV land, Hair Specialist, superior to and in greater de-
mand than all other Preparations for promoting the growth
and restoring the color to the Hair ? Because they are the
result of a practical knowledge—2o years’ experience—of all
the Diseases of the Hair, and what is necessary to remove
them. Whereas nearly all other preparations are manufac-
tured by quacks, and are nothing but quack nostrums,
ji A gentleman in writing says : —“ Everywhere Igo I hear
people speaking highly of your Preparations for the Hair.”
Another gentleman says : —“ By a mere chance I have had
a good opportunity of witnessing the good effect of your now
well-known Hair Restorer. A friend of mine since boyhood
was quite bald on top of head, and, to my knowledge, tried most things mentioned without any result. A few months
a” he informed me he was intending to give your Restorer a trial. Of course I laughed, and for which you must for-
.rTve me. I did not see my friend again until a few days ago, and, if you can, judge my surprise on finding my old com-
"ado, not with a bald head, but with a full, thick head of hair. —P. J. CONNORS Esq., Tooma, N.S.W. 20/9/97.

The Song of the Darling Hirer.
The only national work of the blacks was to fowa dam
orilvke of stones across the Darling Uner
The'stones they carried from Lord knows where-a«d the
Lord knows how. The people of B °"rke kept «P " a
tion for months above the town by a ‘
The Darling rises in blazing droipJ.ls f ‘ or "
land rains. There are banks and beds of good clay an
rock along the river. H.L.
The skies are brass and the plains are bare,
Death and ruin are everywhere
And all that is left of the last year’s flood
Is a sickly stream on the grey -black mud;
The salt-springs bubble and quagmires quiver,
And—this is the dirge of the Darling River :
«I r i S e in the drought from the Queensland rain,
I fill my branches again and again ;
I hold my billabongs back in vain,
For my life and my peoples the South Seas drain ;
And the land grows old and the people never
Will see the worth of the Darling River.
“I drown dry gullies and lave bare hills,
I turn drought-ruts into rippling rills
I form fair islands and glades all green
Till every bend is a sylvan scene.
I have watered the barren lands ten leagues wide !
But in vain I have tried, ah ! in vain I have tried
To show the sign of the Great All Giver,
The Word to a people : O ! Lock your river.
“ I want no blistering barge aground,
But racing steamers the seasons round ;
I want fair homes on my lonely ways,
A people’s love and a people’s praise—
And rosy children to dive and swim—
And fair girls’ feet in my rippling brim ;
And cool, green forests and gardens e'er ”
Oh, this is the hymn of the Darling River.
The sky is brass and the scrub-lands ylare,
Death and ruin are everywhere ;
Thrown high to bleach , or deep in the mud
The bones lie buried by last year's flood,
And the Demons dance from the Never Never
To laugh at the rise of the Dari in ' River.
Sydney, February, 1899.
HENRY LAWSON.
The Tale the Stampers Tell.
When a fellow-man detains you by the button of
your coat,
With a most alluring story of a mine he has to
float,
Then remember, lest the tempter o’er thy prudence
should prevail,
That the stampers, if consulted, could unfold a
truer tale.
They’ve a lease, he says, located on some famous
line of reef;
It's a fortune for the owners, is his confident
belief;
Do they fear to grow too wealthy that the owners
wish to sell ?
Ah ! you wonder what the story is the stampers
have to tell.
And their four-foot reef was assayed, and the
assay paper showed
It would yield upon an average some ounces to
the load—
Or the lode ! you think, and murmur something
like “Oh, very well,
I’ll see about it ! ” —when you hear the tale the
stampers tell.
He produces a prospectus from a pocket near his
hip,
Like a pistol, to persuad * you to accept a pile of
scrip.
Be on guard ; it might be loaded like a dynamiter’s
shell,
Built to “ bust ” if brought in contact with the
tale the stampers tell.
He unrolls the deadly foolscap and displays to
mind and eye
The opinion of an expert, on whose judgment
they rely.
Yes ! they’ll all re-lie upon it, never fear; but
you’ll do well
If you anchor your reliance on the tale the
stampers tell.
There are many other points on which emphatic
stress is laid,
Till it’s certain, on their showing, there’s a fortune
to be made ;
But you notice one omission in the proofs on which
they dwell,
For there’s not the slightest mention of the tale
the stampers tell.
So you take that deadly paper, with its expert-
man’s report

“puffs”—and resort
To the mill-shed where the stampers raise their

The Legend.
IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,
determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, having
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreating
' trough New Jersey on New York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth.
La Payette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
fight, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fought
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Fayette’s soldiers
i were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
them. Marching with drum and life
was an old man, Jeremiah Wynton, and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
through the field. The son with ban-
daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
catching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
out with him the soul-irispiring rattle of
the drum. Father, son, and grandson
had accompanied the troops as volunteers,
and were ever in the forefront of the
fight. The fierce light of battle was in
their eyes, they knew no fear, arid many
a wild cheer arose, as on that fateful
day Yankee Doodle was heard as never
was heard before or since.

Breaking Out in a Hew Place.
Several years ago Premier Reid promised
on his most solemn Yes-No that he would
proceed as speedily as possible to reform the
Legislative Council of New South Wales—
to “ bring it in touch with the people ” —to
“make it responsible to the people”—to
“ let air in upon the stuffy atmosphere of
fossilism ” —and many other things of the
kind. The promise proved to be mere
deception and blither and confidence-trick,
like almost every other promise of progress
and radical reform made from the same
quarter ; still it is worth remembering just
now that such a promise existed. There
was no serious difficulty about its perform-
ance either. The Reid Government then
had a huge majority in the Assembly—suffi-
cient to carry the Reform Bill a dozen times
over. It had the people at its back ; George
Reid went to the country in ’94 and ’95 and
’9B to ask for authority to mend the dreadful
House of Nominees and came back to office
each time. He was in a position to demand
the appointment of enough new Councillors
to carry his Bill in the Upper House itself.
And the Council jumped on his tail with
sufficient vigor to rouse any courageous man to-
action, when it rejected his Probate duties,
and otherwise turned his policy wrong end
up. Yet the unreformed Council still lags ,
on, simply because all desire to reform it has
apparently gone out of George Reid—if
any such thing was ever in him. And when
he sent up the new Federal Bill—the one in
which he professes to believe most ardently
—to the unreformed House which he knows
to be against* Federation in any shape or
form, he didn’t even fill up the existing
vacancies by the appointment of a few real
Federalists so as to give the measure a show.
Through deaths and resignations the New
South Wales Upper House has dwindled
from a membership of 70 in the latter days
of ’95 to 57, so there are a large number o .
seats waiting to be filled. And Reid, who
added 10 members to a House of 60 in order
to carry his provincial finance policy, didn’t
send up one to a smaller House when the
question at issue was the making of an Aus-
tralian nation. ,
* * » *
The unreformed Council made four notable
alterations in the Enabling Bill, all tending
to its destruction. It decreed that before
Federation can be accomplished the Constitu-
tion Bill must be accepted by a majority at
the polls, and that majority must consist of at
least- one-fourth of the electors—equal to
about 80,000 voters. If there are 75,000
voters for the Bill, and one man, or not even
one man, against it, the one man, or no man
at all, is to win, and the 75,000 are to count
for nothing. It also enacted that the poll
must not be taken for three months, in order
to give the people time to grow weary of
the subject and to give the Anti-Bill party
leisure to flood the country with more lies
and misrepresentations. A third alteration
was that New South Wales would not fede-
rate under any conditions whatever unless
Queensland came* in—in the elegant phrase
of G. Dibbs, New South Wales is to “bow
down at the feet of its youngest child ” and
wait its permission to federate. And then,
by way of rounding off the Council’s great
effort, a clause was inserted stating that the
Legislature carefully refrained from any ex-
pression of approval regarding the Federa-
tion scheme (which, seeing that the Council
is only half the Legislature, isn’t any very
notable adherence to the truth); it merely
sent the Bill to the people with its warmest
curse, and with all these limitations on the
popular will, and with the silent reservation
that, even if it is accepted by the largest
majority ever known in New South Wales,
the Council may refuse to concur after all in
applying to the British Government for the
necessary confirmation, and thus shunt the
whole matter into oblivion.
* * * *
All these remarkable doings were effected
in a thin House of about 30 fossils, who re-
present nobody except themselves and the
mostly dead and gone and disgraced Govern-
ments that gave them their billets, and who
hold their places by the vote of not one man
or woman or dog in all New South Wales.
The 30 deliberately reversed the decision of
the Popular Chamber—the one which repre-
sents 324,000 electors, or as many of them
as care to vote. They were encouraged to
do it, partly because they have already
trodden with impunity on the weak Premier
over the Probate Bill and other matters ;
partly because they were incited to resist the
popular will on the matter of Federation
by the frenzy of Attorney General Want,
and Reid took Want back into his
Ministry as a guarantee of approval;
partly because, through long experi-
ence, they have learned to regard Reid’s
threats of Council Reform as the wails of
a man of straw crying in the wilderness.
Also, they were encouraged above all things
by the significant fact that when four Coun-
cillors of the Federalist party—almost the
whole fighting strength of that party in the
Upper House—resigned in order to contest
Assembly constituencies last year Premier
Reid made no effort to fill their places with
new M’sL.C. of a similar persuasion. He
deliberately left the parochial party in
possession, and sent the Enabling Bill up to
be at its mercy, and the parochial party
took the hint. Whatever action the pres-
sure of popular opinion or of the Assembly
majority or of his own uncertain conscience
might cause him to take afterwards, that was
the situation last week.
* * * *
The reasons assigned by those of the
fossils who attempted to assign anything
were mostly pitiful efforts to put an appear-
ance of patriotism on what was pure selfish-
ness and narrow bigotry. Kater, who pro-
posed that New South Wales shouldn’t fede-
rate unless Queensland did likewise, alleged
that the tariff of Queensland was lower than
in the other provinces (amount raised
by tariff duties per inhabitant per annum
in various provinces ; Queensland, £2l4s. 7d.
Tasmania, £2 3s. lid.; Victoria, £1 15s.
lid. ; South Australia, £1 13s. sd. ; New
South Wales, £1 3s. Id.). Therefore,
according to Kater, Queensland, being a
low-tariff province, would be affected by the
Braddon clause in the same way as New
South Wales, and would help New South
Wales to get rid of it. The real trouble is
that Queensland’s adherence makes the
financial difficulty vastly worse than it ever
was before. Westralia being specially pro-
vided for, the question formerly was how to
raise enough tariff revenue to keep Tasmania
solvent, that province being accustomed to
obtain £2 3s. lid. per inhabitant per annum
from its customs and excise ; now it is a
question of making a tariff that will keep
Queensland afloat—a province that has been
accustomed to get £2 14s. 7d. per inhabitant
yearly from its tariff, so Queensland wants
to maintain the Braddon clause 25 per cent,
worse than Tasmania, and is nearly twice as
much interested in the maintenance of the
Blot as Victoria. It is difficult to suppose
that a man who quoted Queensland as a low-
tariff province was in his right mind, but
Kater did so quote it, and that was the
only reason assigned why New South Wales
should federate only on condition that the
Piebald Land comes in. The reason assigned
for demanding a delay of three months before
the Referendum was that the people might
have time to think over the measure, which
has already been thought over f or about a
year. And the 79,000 or 80,000 minimum
was inserted on no alleged grounds at all
except that Jago Smith said it was reason-
able—as the Smith intellect understands
such things.
• * « *
The little Heydon push which took these
remarkable liberties with the people’s votes
has no commission or authority from the
people whatsoever. It once tried to get
such a thing when it put up five candi-
dates at the election of Federal dele-
gates, and the people left the ridiculous
little Heydon clique in a suitable place
of ignominy at the bottom of the poll.
And the fact that this crowd which the
people contemptuously kicked as they would
any other lost dog the only time they came
into contact with it, should have, technically
at least, as much authority to govern New
South Wales as the people’s own repre-
sentatives, is a very powerful reason
why the reform of the Council should
be proceeded with at once. Even if the
present difficulty is got over, the same crowd
of provincialists will be lying in wait to
destroy the Federal design after its accept-
ance by the people. And if Federation is
accomplished there will still be many matters
left in the hands of the State Parliament,
and a sane and honest Legislative Council
will be wanted then almost as much as it is
now. New South Wales has waited long for
its promising Wobbler to begin his loudly-
advertised reform, and in view of the latest
outbreak of the House of Fossils it is now
waiting harder than ever. The present
situation is a stupid anomaly. If the House
which doesn’t represent the people says the
same thing as the House which does repre-
sent the people, it is useless ; if it says the
other thing then the people have to go to
great trouble and expense to put it down,
for to allow the House which represents
nobody to undo the work of the one
which has a mandate direct from the
nation is turning Representative Government
upside-down. At the same time a House
elected on a property suffrage is merely a re-
version to the worst evils of the plural pro-
perty-vote system ; and one elected on the
same suffrage and by the same separate con-
stituencies as the Assembly would be a use-
less duplicate of the House of Roads and
Bridges ; and the abolition of the Upper
House, thereby leaving all the power in the
hands of the men whose chief business it is
to snatch roads and bridges and culverts for
their own separate constituencies, is doubt-
ful policy. The one promising device is to
make the Council a body elected on a man-
hood suffrage basis with the whole of New
South Wales as its constituency, so that it
will represent the interests of New South
Wales as a whole—not those of Kiama or
Tumberumba or Boggabri separately ; and if
some less uncertain Wobbler than G. Reid
would arise and effect this reform the coun-
try would owe him a statue many cubits
high.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Legislator’s Reasons.
Judging by the S.M. Herald’s report, the
member of N.S.W. House of Nominees who
put up the biggest record for bumptious ignor-
ance was Macintosh, M.L.0., an old gentle-
man who has been forgetting things in the
Council ever since ’Bl :
The effect of Federation would be that they would be
more heavily taxed than they had ever been taxed before.
Money would be collected from the customs which would
not be expend) din the colony. (Hear, hear.) If the Bill
were passed New South Wales would have to pay £50,000
to reimburse Victoria her loss by the abolition of the
stock-tax. Every article the people of this colony pur-
chased would be subjected to a heavier price than they
had paid hitherto. Then, New South Wales would have
to impose fresh customs taxation to keep up its own
revenue. The land and income taxes would have to be
doubled, and the exemptions would have to be given up.
So that every person in New South Wales owning land
would have to pay a land-tax. The other colonies were
now in a position that they could hardly pay their debts.
Most of them were in a decline. He could not conceive
that Queensland should ever enter the federation. She
must have colored labor, and that would prevent
that colony from joining in the federation. He did
not want the city of Sydney created as the Federal
capital, but he wanted to see the Federal capi-
tal in the vicinity of Sydney. The “ conces-
sion ” in favor of New South Wales was thrown
to them as a bone would be thrown to a dog. This
colony required the use of the whole of its rivers for
purposes of irrigation. If the Bill were passed they could
no longer have a free breakfast-table. The objection to
the Federal tariff would not be so pronounced if the
money raised under it in New South Wales were to be
spent in the colony ; but that would not be so. It would
be taken to equalise duties abolished in the other colo-
nies, especially such as the £50,000 or £60,000 now raised
by a stock-tax. If the Commonwealth Bill became law,
the taxation of the country would fall upon the masses of
the people ; and if the present direct taxation were to be
doubled, then the exemptions would have to be abolished.
That would affect a large number of struggling people.
Sydney was entitled to be selected as the site for the
Federal capital.
It is the same old yarn about how the wonder-
ful Victorian is to somehow take anything he
wants from the imbecile Cornstalk, without the
latter kicking once in his own defence. There
is nothing in the Federal Constitution to make
N.S.W. pay Victoria’s lost stock-tax any more
than there is to make Victoria pay up N.S. VV.’s
lost spirit-duties. N.S.W., under Federation,
can’t “impose fresh customs taxation to keep up
its own revenue”—no province will be allowed to
do anything of the kind. Macintosh might as
well say that he will be forced to cut off his
own head and pub it in pickle. And old Mac.
holds that because N.S.W. will raise more cus-
toms taxation than it does now, therefore it
will be so liard-up through getting all this
extra money that it will have to double its
direct taxes, otherwise it will go broke by
reason of its surplus. The old man is much
troubled because the other provinces are all in
a financial decline, but seeing that they all,
barring Westralia, show a great increase of
revenue this year, he seems to be tearing his
scanty hairs on this subject quite need-
lessly. And seeing that N.S.W. has got
a pretty firm lien on the capital, where a lot of
the money will be spent, it looks more like a
case of it getting the customs revenue of the
other provinces than of losing its own. And
Macintosh actually thinks the people
of N.S.W., with its sugar and tea duties,
have got a free breakfast table. It is
difficult to imagine how any self-respecting
community would trust a man who knew so
little as Macintosh to manage a baked-potato
can, but the ancient is a life-legislator, and has
been slopping over with such wisdom as the
above in the senatorial halls for 18 weary years.
Our Homicidal Defenders.
Dear Bulletin.—Seems to me that Labor-
member Hancock, who has a reputation for
“ hating the very sight of a soldier,” could
very easily justify himself by introducing to
the Yic. Assembly statistics showing the
enormous proportion of murders and man-
slaughters committed in Australia, during the
last 10 years, by men who have borne arms on
behalf of Her Gracious. I can remember several
instances, and can also remember that I’ve for-
gotten the names and details in many more
instances where a cold-blooded murder or reck-
less manslaughter was the act of a soldier or
ex-soldier. Considering the limited number of
Tommy Atkinses in this country, the large
number of butcheries registered to the dis-
credit of “ Her Majesty’s uniform ” should be
a matter for serious discussion between the
friends and opponents of military spirit. There
are men laboring always at the collection
of all sorts of dry statistics for political
purposes, but none up to now has ever
gone to the trouble of showing the awful effects
of “ military spirit ” in the modern crime annals
of the British portions of the world. Great
Britain, being the least military of the powerful
nations, offers the best test. As far as the
Australian figures go, the result of the enquiry
would be a world-startler, I believe. This
letter was inspired by a Bulletin reference to
murderer Briggs, of Sydney, as an “ ex-artil-
leryman,” which set me thinking of how
frequently a soger, active or retired, had been
tried for blood-shedding. Then I came across
this in Melb. Argus :
The shooting of Gunner Briner, of the Permanent
Artillery, by a fellow-soldier, named Pollock, seems
motiveless. . . . Ten days before the tragedy, he was in
company with Gunner Brown, and, without any mention
of the subject previously, he said, “ Brown, I’ll shoot
you.” ... On the night of the tragedy, the men were
retiring to rest together when Pollock, turning to Gunner
Hamilton, said, “ Will you dare me to shoot you? I’ll
shoot a man for less than sixpence.” Hamilton turned
the subject off, but Briner, who was sitting on the bed,
interposed, remarking, ‘‘l knew you weren’t game.
You’re a great bluffer, Pollock.” The man instantly
took down his rifle from the rack, loaded the weapon, and
fired point-blank at Briner. The bullet passed right
through his body. . . . Pollock served for nine years in
the Imperial Army.
The Argus suggestion that the shooting of
gunner Briner was “quite motiveless,” is
quite worthy of that hundred-eyed journal.
The motive for gunner Pollock’s crime sticks
out a mile. Military spirit was the motive—
simply that and nothing more. Train a man
to the profession of arms, license him to carry a
gun for the possible destruction of a fellow
creature, and the germ of homicidal mania will
surely develope in his nature, if it was favor-
ably disposed to the germ in the first instance.

The Great Skedaddle.
The plaint of the Melbourne Age about how
the high income-tax is driving foreign capital
away from Victoria has caught on with that
section of the press which doesn’t think for
itself, but gets the loan of its opinions ready
made. In Victoria the tax on incomes derived
from property is nothing on the first £200;
Bd. in the £on the next £1000; Is. in the £on
the second /1000, and Is. 4d. in the £ after
that; so a man with ,£3200 a year derived from
property would pay £l5O tax —equal to 11R1.
in the £ all round. In N.S. W. he would pay
only £75. Undoubtedly the Victorian income-
tax hits the enormously rich man more heavily
than he is hit elsewhere. And David Syme,
being one of the handful of very rich men who
are affected by the top rate, desires to point
out to his afflicted land that the tax which smites
him heavily on the pocket is ruining the blessed
country, and on behalf of the country he asks
that the impost which bangs him personally on
his tenderest point should be removed. Accord-
ing to David Syme’s organ, £8,000,000 of foreign
capital which used to be in Victoria, costing the
country about £400,000 a year interest, has gone
away, and new foreign capital isn’t pouring in
as it used to pour. The province isn’t import-
ing debts and liabilities and embarrassments as
it did. When any British capitalist has money
to lend, according to the Age, he now sends it
to N.S.W., because of the lower income-tax;
and N.S. W. has to pay the interest and struggle
with the liability. The Age holds that this
alleged state of things is very disastrous in-
deed, and is conclusive evidence that the Is. 4d.
in the £ should be abolished. And, apropos of
the alleged £8,000,000 which has left Victoria,
and the money which has ceased coming into
Victoria on account of the income-tax, and the
money that is said to be pouring into N.S.W.
by reason of its smaller income-tax, the follow-
ing is a matter of some interest: The visible
stock of money in Victoria, as shown by the
banking returns, has diminished between
January, ’95 (just before the Vic. income-tax
started), and January, ’99, by £1,632,435;
while that of N.S. W. has declined by <£1,665,349.
It is difficult for a tremendous lot of capital
to fly out of any country except in the form of
coin. Lands and houses and railways can’t
bolt, and the wool and surplus grain go in any
case. So when the province which is said to
have lost £8,000,000 of capital through its
heavy taxation shows a smaller decline in its
stock of cash than the province into which the
money is said to be pouring on account of its
lighter taxation, it looks as if the alleged
exit was only a Fatman scare, got up by Fat-
man to discredit a very necessary impost which
strikes the Fatman a rather severe whack on
the money-bag. The mournful little moan
about how foreign capital is being “driven out”
is never backed by any evidence. It is simply
alleged that the country doesn’t owe so much
money to Bull as it did, and the fact that it is


bad not to owe so much money to Bull is
spoken of as being so self-evident that it is
quite absurd to bring proof in support of it.
It is one of those things which ary fool can see
at a glance. And a good many fools do see it,
or think they do.
A Plan for Suppressing the Aged Poor.
It seems generally recognised in Victoria,
despite Premier Turner’s denials, that the last
refuge of the aged poor is the gaol —failing the
ever-yawning Yarra. Nearly a year ago an old
lady of 66 was sentenced by the City Bench to
12 months’ hard labor for having no lawful
means ; and, in fact, for want of a proper place
to bestow her. Recently the old lady had an
attack of paralysis, and became even more
helpless than before. Her term expired a week
or two ago, and as even callous Mel-
bourne has not yet reached that stage
when it can unconcernedly chuck the old
poor into the Saltwater River, and as the
sight of an aged paralytic expiring in the
public street would be an offence to the eyes of
the populace, a local J.P. attended at the gaol
and sentenced the ancient dame to a further
twelve months. It was done, apparently, in
the blessed hope that she would expire before
the year was. up, and so cease from being a
source of expense to the Treasury, and an
affront to the self-satisfaction of the well-to-do.
Meanwhile it is quite a new thing to learn that
a person who is already in gaol for having no
visible means can, without open trial, be sen-
tenced to further imprisonment by a single
magistrate for still having no visible means.
If this disgraceful process is lawful, then a
J.P. can give a workless man six months as a
vagrant, and, every time his sentence is
near expiring, call in at the gaol and give him
six months more ad infinitum. Still it is a
simple way of getting rid of those objectionable
nuisances—the aged poor.
Another Boiler.
Another burst boiler ; this time at Parkes
(N.S.W.) :
A magisterial inquiry was opened re the death of Jambs
Heraohty, killed in the recent hoiler explosion. Evi-
dence was given that deceased was thrown a distance of
70yds., and that the clothes were stripped from his body.
From the evidence of John Mackey, one of the tributors,
it would appear that he had driven the engine for the past
12 months, except when his brother, Thomas, relieved
him when ill. He was so relieving at the time of the
accident, and had been in charge nine days. The boiler
used to blow off at 651 b., but had a pressure of 701 b. on it
occasionally. When the boiler was put in position 12
months ago, it was subjected to a hydraulic test of 1121 b.
It had not since been tested. The lever of the safety-
valve had been lengthened, but the ball was lighter than
that belonging to the boiler. He was aware that the
regulations provided that the boiler should be tested
every six months, and this had not been done. He saw
the boiler tested in the first instance, and no visible
effects were produced by the water pressure.
Thos. Matthews deposed to recommending the pur-
chase of the boiler from the Caleula mine. It was then
subjected to a water test of 1161 b., and struck with a
heavy hammer. Witness had tested it before work was
started up to 1201 b. He would not have recommended
his co. to purchase a defective boiler. He had advised
making the lever longer, as they had to hang chains on
the valve if they required 601 b. of steam. The boiler
would blow off with less than 701 b. of steam on.
Henry Hooke, District Inspector of Mines, gave evi-
dence. The boiler was 15ft. long, with a diameter of sft. ;
it was of the Cornish type, and was over 20 years
old, and was weak in construction. The inspector
emptied the water far below the crown plate. There
was no convincing evidence of overheating. The
crown plates were blown downwards, but the boiler
was not shifted, nor were the mountings destroyed.
Where fractured, the iron appeared to have lost much of
its porous texture, and to be crystallised. The water-
gauge was in a position wholly wrong, being seven inches
too low. On the 24th Aug. of last year two inspectors of
mines had warned the tributors about the pressure the
boiler had to hear. It was then up to 90 pounds ; the
safety-valve being weighted. Notice of legal proceedings
was then served. He attributed the accident to the
weakness of the crown plates, caused by gradually wear-
ing out, and was of opinion that the pressure at which
the boiler was worked—6s pounds—was too great for one
of its type and age. The plates were three-eighths of an
inch thick.
Good old faithful, worn-out, crystallised-iron
boiler with its water-gauge out of place, and
chains hung on to the safety-valve to keep it
down. Still, that Land Boilers Inspection Act
will come along some day.

The “Australian Naval Station.”
The average Australian citizen, and nine-tenths
of Australian politicians, are wonderfully ignor-
ant of the true situation as regards the
“ Auxiliary Squadron.” When, the other day,
an outbreak of hostilities was reported from
Samoa, the intervention of the squadron was
thought in many quarters to need the sanction
•of the Australian Govts. But this is a delu-
sion. Sydney is the headquarters of the fleet,
but where the Admiral may take it in time of
emergency is a matter of such loose arrange-
ment as to leave Australia totally at the mercy
of circumstances. Australasia pays ,£126,000 a
year for the fleet; £91,000 as maintenance, and
£35,000 as interest on the prime cost of con-
struction. Yet it can’t be sure of having a
ship of the squadron on hand if dire necessity
called. What deceives most people is the
widely-published clause in the agreement stat-
ing that the vessels shall not be employed be-
yond the limits of the Australian Station with-
out the consent of the contributing Govts.
What are the bounds of the Australian Station ?
The ordinary citizen takes them to be a few
miles round the Australian coast. But the
Admiralty has defined the Australian Station
to run “ from 95deg. E. long, by the parallel of
lOdeg. S. lat. to 130 deg. E. long. ; thence north
to 12deg. N. lat., and along the parallel to
160 deg. W. long. ; bounded on the south by the
Antarctic circle ; and including the numerous
groups of islands situated within the limits
specified.” Take up a map and trace out the
area of ocean here defined, and a new idea of
what the Australian Naval Station means will
assert itself. From the extent of the Station,
the Squadron could be lost to Australia for
months and yet be acting up to the letter of
the contract.

Medical Sweating.
A m:edico holds forth on the lodge sweating
question :
Ed. Bulletin. — He the medical man who is blamed by
his younger brethren because, while possessing a fair
private practice, he takes lodge business—it is not alto-
gether his fault. His private work lies largely among the
relations and friends of the lodge patients ; and if, in a
oountry town, he refuses lodttc-work, things hot
dSfndiw on the in-aglnatior^of
the narrator, and he finds that is a. ] n i\ge.
Also, if the practitioners of a town comb "® ™ ™ S ,? ,o Un g
rates, a city advt. will promptly br.ng along
man, on the look-ou t for an opening, a new
petitor for practice will be added, with t k
influence behind him. with a
Much of the evil is due to faults of tr^'" lr 'r; ,
firm belief in his own powers and an “ !u' inrl »
ignorance the young medico is launched on the world. A
few locums, or a term at a hospital, oonttra® him in trie
opinion that he is a second Galen, and he saves sufficient
money to buy a practice. Then he marries and settles
down"; ” but as the patients do not come, and his com is
running out, his original contempt for lodge-busin .ss
(imbibed from the top-notch physmians and surgeous of
his hospital) has to give way, and at first opportunity he
joins the noble army of martyrs. ‘ Adenoid (ft,
22/10/’9B) speaks cheerily of hanging up the shingle in a
lodge-less district, but its presence would result in a crop
of clubs within a twelve-month. Refuse them, and they
boycott the pioneer and import a raw production of the
schools- 11 another doctor.” (It is no exaggeration to say
that within a decade nine-tenths of Australians
will be in lodges, and the other tenth outside
only because they are too thriftless to pay their dues.)
But worse than he is the hospital hard-bargain, desiring
merely a new place to run up a grog-tick, the man who
is driven to desperation by miningcalls, and the drifting,
aimless incompetent generally. But a doctor is alwaysa
doctor to a lodge-committee, and anything with a regis-
trable qualification will do to be sweated. The solution
lies inter alia in a return to the old plan of apprentice-
ship to a reputable practitioner during half the training
course. Medical ethics also should form a subject of
instruction and of examination, and particularly the
club system should be squelched on the lines advocated
by Bruck and others —namely, by a, pro-rata subscription
of, say, ten shillings per cent, on the candidates’ income,
such income to be sworn to in a statutory declaration.
With these provisions, two things would happen. We
should not have the spectacle of an ex-Minister of the
Crown, with a big pension, using his lodge privileges to
the utmost at an outlay of 16s. per annum ; and we
should obtain as medical men many brilliant young
fellows who see clearly the coming ruin of the younger
portion of the Australian medical profession by the
avarice of lodge secretaries and committee-men.
A Divorce Deadlock.
To the lay mind, petitioner Belton certainly
seems to have a grievance. Some years ago he
sought relief in divorce for desertion, &c.,
before a Victorian Judge. His desertion claim
appears to have been a good one, but a counter
petition by the wife revealed the fact' that he
had in some degree contributed to the deser-
tion. Both parties desired divorce, but the
Judge said that, under the circumstances, he
couldn’t act. After this rebuff, Belton wished
to resume matrimonial relations, but Mrs. B.
declined—in fact, she was in England, and
meant to keep out of his road. Three
years passed, and B. applied for a divorce
again, on the ground of three years’
desertion. But Judge A’Beckett has re-
fused him relief because the desertion was
only, he holds, a continuance of the previous
desertion, and because an English case in 1869
decided that there can be no desertion unless
it is a termination of a previous cohabitation.
The English courts have carried this idea to its
logical conclusion by holding that there could
be no desertion where there was no cohabita-
tion at all, so that, if a man left his wife at the
church-door and never came back, even 50
years’ desertion wouldn’t entitle her to
relief. Yet, on the analogy of a Melb.
case of a few years ago, the Judge could surely
have found a way out of his merely tech-
nical difficulty. In this case petitioner had
proved adultery with a doctor against his
wife, but had failed to obtain the divorce,
because he himself had also been guilty
of adultery. When, however, some time after
petitioner sought divorce on the strength of
subsequent adulteries of his wife with the
doctor, he got it—with ease, despite the pre-
vious refusal and his own previous adultery.
Surely the effect of a contributing cause of
desertion should not go on for ever and ever,
when the effect of a contributing cause of adul-
tery ceases with a divorce'suit. Such a slate
of the law, if it is the law, will hardly conduce
to public morality. It is highly undesirable
that there should be any persons in the com-
munity perpetually debarred from divorce,
even when both parties are willing to be
divorced, on grounds open to all other members
of the community. Such a state of things must
inevitably produce on a small scale the same
train of evil consequences to children as would
be the case if guilty divorced persons were
barred from subsequent marriage.
A Word of Sympathy.
A sympathiser, who reckons that The Bulle-
tin is going wrong, sends along some kindly
advice: —
Bulletin’s interest as well as policy is Federation, and
the sooner the better.
G. H. Reid is de facto leader, and the only possible one
above ground at present.
Why, therefore, play into enemy’s hands by raking up
the past ? That’s Sydney D.T.’s game.
Our policy is to make Reid's case strong.
Why antagonise Ms.P. by pointing out, without appar-
ent cause, reductions in their number ? See your last
issue.
Let the enemy, and we have enough of ’em, point out
these things.
Don’t let a line go in from on Federation. He’s
been an enemy from the jump, and I attribute all pars. I
complain of to him.
Let’s be united, welcoming help from the devil himself.
This paper is grateful for the advice, anyhow.
At the same time it doesn’t exactly know
where its interest lies —in fact, personally, it
doesn’t even see its way to getting the price of
a sixpenny drink out of Federation, beyond the
fact that it gets stamps of all the Seven Pro-
vinces in payment of small sums, and, when the
same stamps are good all over Australia, it will
save something in discount—so it isn’t worry-
ing much on that score. And it isn’t good
enough for any paper which believes enthusias-
tically in Federation, as The Bulletin does
with all its heart and soul, to back up Reid, the
Wobbler, as the only possible leader. For The
Bulletin is almost convinced that Reid the
Wobbler will w’obble again, therefore its policy
is to keep all Federationists in mind that he
was a wobbler all along, and to keep before
them the fact that when next he wobbles the
cause hasn’t lost an essential guide, but can go
on just the same. To teach the people that a
limp rag tyke (I. Reid is essential to their cause
is only preparing them for despair when next
the limp rag deserts. For the rest,
doesn’t write a line for this paper, and
hasn’t done so for years. And The Bul-
letin isn’t antagonising M’s.P. by pointing
out that many of them must lose their billets
in a reduced State Parliament. Every M.P.
knows that, and 76 per cent, of them
are secretly hostile for that reason. Why The
Bulletin yells this matter in the public ear is
that it is essential for the public also to
know it, and keep it in view. When
M’sP., for the sake of their billets, try, directly
or indirectly, to influence the people against
Federation, allegedly on grounds of pure
patriotism, and when Sydney property-owners
do it because the only thing that will pay them
is to have the Federal capital right on top of
their allotments, and when papers do it for
fear of losing their free postage at the expense
of the taxpayer, it is always well to keep it
before the public that these persons have a
powerful cash inducement to lie against the
Federal movement, and that their statements
are not to be received with absolute faith in
consequence. The Bulletin would cheerfully
accept the assistance of the Devil in the good
cause; but at the same time it isn’t good
enough to rely on the Devil’s unsupported
assurance that he is leading in the right direc-
tion. It’s best to have a compass in one hand
and a tight hold of the alleged assistant’s tail y
with the other.

Victorian Gold Grabs.
People who place faith- in the mumblings of
irresponsible philosophy may perhaps be pleased
to discover that, inasmuch as the unemployed
pressure in Victoria has proved the absolute
rottenness of gold-prospeciing as a wage-earn-
ing resource, it isn’t altogether an unprofitable
disaster. When the rush of miners to Wes-
tralia took place, the leading papers were full
of astonishment that people should throw aside
the bird in hand for the prospect of the fowl
in the bush. It was pointed out what an im-
mense area of Vic. land remained unprospected.
Miners were conjured to c. insider the folly of
leaving behind them nuggets that only wanted
looking for, in search of gold that had but a
problematical existence. But the papers didn’t
mention that the whole known area of gold-
producing country in Victoria is pretty well
leased by individuals or syndicates that don’t
work the ground, and that the prospector is met
on all sides with the notice, “Applied for Lease.”
All round Clunes, Majorca, Cresw’ick, and other
centres, hundreds—nay thousands—of acres are
thus barred against the inquisitive prospector.
Some of these leases have a couple of men
“ working ” upon them (to keep up a respect-
able appearance) at half wages. Many of these
leases have been held—for speculative purposes
—for 10, 15, and even 20 years with practically
no work done. Solong as the rent is paid, dummy
leases can be conserved, under the present rotten
system, until the day of judgment. Company-
mongers and stock-jobbers, and rings, and every
device for grabbing public rights and turning
them, by chicanery, into profit, have ruined
the gold-producing interests of Victoria. At
any rate, they have driven the best of the
mining population out of the business. It is
enough to make an honest man spit at the bell-
toppered, frock - coated, Collins - street pick-
pockets of the Stock Exchange when he thinks
of the hundreds of honest, long-suffering miners
who are now doomed to fossick old claims for
bread, while such a large area of good ground
is locked up to no purpose. Then the papers !
Oh ! they “ think the evil is exaggerated.”
So does Minister Foster. So does everyone
who knows no more about the circumstances
than Official Returns and Red Tape Reports
feel inclined to reveal.

A Curse from the Holy City.
The Bulletin receives .from Adelaide (S.A.)
an infuriated letter..:— :
To The Bulletin.— l have just been reading Mr.
Millen’s appeal re the Afghan case, and Tip, surprised at
your sticking- up tor the black s.. If you really
started the subscription with £lo'you blight to know
better. Why it’s the best thing ever happened; It will
perhaps teach the Afghans to keep in their own part of
the Globe. It has been done.only to choak ’em off.
’em, there is too many of ’em in Australia now, an’, for
God sake, don’t encourage ’em.—Yours, &c., An Austra-
lian Afghan.
It is curious what, .kind of logic some alleged
white men can be guilty of. The Bulletin
thought the best way to “choak ’em off,” in
the absence of a proper Alien Act, was to hit
the co. which imports them a severe blow in
the money-bag by breaking up the form of
agreement which makes their importation so
profitable. And the above person reckons that
the best way to abolish the imported nigger is
to protect the co. which imports the nigger,
and assure it that it may go on bringing in en-
slaved niggers from Asia, for the law here will
help it to keep them when they arrive, and
maintain the system which makes the importa-
tion of niggers a paying industry. In other
words, be wants to encourage the big responsi-
ble nigger—the boss Afghan of the Camel
Carrying Co.—to keep the small nigger, by
way of discouraging niggers in general. And
The Bulletin, in its ignorance, was trying to
discourage the large boss nigger who was the
beginning of the whole trouble.
N.S.W. Council decided that N.S.W. should
not federate unless Queensland came in, the
obvious idea being that the capital could then
be planted just at the back door of Sydney, not
because Sydney wanted it there from any sel-
fish motive, but because Sydney yearned to do
the fair thing to both Melbourne and Brisbane
by putting the Federal city half-way between
them (at Sydney). But as the old bell-
toppered fragments couldn’t well say this
they pretended to believe that Queens-
land (with almost the heaviest tariff in
Australia) was a low-tariff province, and, there-
fore, the natural ally of Foreign-trade N.S. W.
Then, on 20th March (just a day or two later)
the chief anti-Billious organ, Sydney Tele :
graph, in its commercial columns gave the
show away by estimating that Queensland
depends so much on its customs that the aboli-
tion of border duties and the imposition of a
moderate Federal tariff would leave that
province with a deficit of <£2 3s. per inhabi-
tant per annum, the biggest shortage (per head)
of the lot—about £1,070,000. And it Adds
that it would be madness for Queensland to
come in unless the Federal Government helped
it to the extent of a million a year. So one
section of Anti-Billites says that N.S. W. should
only federate if the rich and prosperous Queens-
land conies in, and another Anti-Billite section
alleges that Queensland is so poor that it can’t
come in unless it gets an enormous subsidy and
urges that province to stand out unless the
subsidy is forthcoming. This is very much
mixed.
I’iiE one striking and eminently satisfactory
feature of the first hatch of Queensland elections
was the summary defeat of the shuffling, unre-
liable members of the Labor-party and the sub-
stitution therefor l of straight men. The
rejection of Hooran by the Cairns electors was
welcomed with joy by every decent Democrat
in the North, for it was u,ell known that he
had left the Burke only. because it was
too hot to hold him. Cross had only
himself to thank for losing.his hold on Cler-
mont. The victory of Grassey at Bundaberg
was emphatically a white Queensland victory,
and Charles Powers may now go and play his
pro-kanaka pipe elsewhere. Personally, Powers
is actually more popular than Grassey in Bun-
daberg, but the little sugar-town would rather
elect Nosey Bob than give alieii-coddlers a
show. And doesn’t the Q. Govt, feel losing
Bundaberg ?' Dickson paid a special visit to
the town on behalf of Powers, arid was saluted
with cries of “ Where’s your kanaka?” Not
being able to answer this question, Oiry
Jimmy was not allowed to proceed with his in-
tended oration, and posterity must weep the
loss accordingly.
“6 x 8 ” writes from N. Queensland :
Dear Bulletin.— Re the Bourke Afghan-agreement
scandal. In N.Q. the legalised selling of Japs, and
kanakas into slavery is alread3' alarmingly influencing the
conditions of white workers. Employes on N.Q. and
other sugar mills have to sign a cast-iron agreement (I
enclose copy) which compels them to work 12 hours a day
or night out of the 24, for the magnificent sum of from 20s.
to 275. 6d, a week and rations—latter consisting of 151 b.
meat, 81b.'flour., tea, 21b. sugar and 71b. sweet-pota-
toes —the latter “if procurable.” The firemen, for a trifle
more wages, have to work' 13 .hours on a stretch. The
mill agreements stand good for the season of generally 6
or 7 months. Part of the wages is “ a bonus of so much
per week provided that you give; satisfaction throughout
the crushing season.” it goes without saying that not all
give that satisfaction. At one mill over 20 men lost their
bonus last season. Also said india-rubber agreement pro-
vides that “ the co. shall deduet from the first two months
the sum of t‘6 (!) such money to be returned if satisfaction
is given, but forfeited if discharged for drunkenness, mis-
behaviour, or neglect of duty.” What is meant by neglect
of duty, and where it begins or ends, is not stated. “ The
c 0.,” says clause 7, “ may at any time discharge said
servant on paying him wages due.” No obligation to pay
the deducted £b. Alt gether, the conditions of the white
Kanaka are scandalous. At two mills last season, the
stipulated meat-ration was of scandalous quality and
frequently in a most smellful condition. Nearly all the
mills employ Chinese cooks only. Water is often stag-
nant, and mixed with stinking molasses —run off into the
creeks : and the scarcity <>f tea is made up by handfuls
of soda thrown into the buckets to “draw the tea-leaves.”
Accommodation wretched; drains unknown; and the
stench and filth about the cook-houses and huts past
description. Overseers and gangers are soused to driving
Kanakas and Japs that no different treatment is dealt
out to whites. Altogether, sugar-mill employes are
whites only in color. If the sugar industry cannot be
carried on except on such conditions, it is high time some
one put down his foot severely on the whole industry.
How radical legislation is handicapped in Tas-
mania. A new electorate had lately been
formed on the West Coast, and, in view of the
fact that upwards of 2000 names (mostly
miners) have been added to the rolls within
the past year, the new seat seemed to offer a
good chance, for a labor man. But it now
transpires that the Act creating the new elec-
torate: expressly provides that the “existing”
kills;shall be oisedri-Le., the rolls compiled in
jyifov., 1897. Thus the 2000 miners who have
been in the district for nearly two years will
b'e disfranchised: Attorney-General Urquhart,
who is personally interested in.the new electo-
rate, was anxious to delay the election until
April of the present year, thus allowing those
who had registered in Nov., ’9B, to have a say
in the contest; hut, to his great surprise, the
other day he discovered that the cunning
Tories had emasculated the measure in the
House when he wasn't looking, by inserting the
little word “existing.” There is a gang of
legislators in Tas. who base their claims to states-
manship upon their ability to take advantage
of the lackadaisical style of legislating which
characterises the Land of Sleep a Lot.
The value of the declaration of the shuffling
Dickson Ministry, that it has closed the gates
of Mongrelia on the Jap, is badly discounted
by the publication of the following in a
Northern paper :
Dear Sir.—ln view of the heavy labor requirements for
this year we would be glad if you would kindly let us
know as early as possible the number of Japanese you
will be wanting so that we may be in a position to advise
our head office in Yokohama in time to allow of a thorough
canvass being made through the inland districts of Japan
by the recruiting officers of the Immigration Department;
in this way we are enabled to send out picked men. In
the evenj of orders arriving in Japan after the beginning
of the harvest season we experience considerable trouble
in securing first-class labor, as their services are then in
demand. Awaiting your prompt attention and handing
you copies of the necessary papers for completion.—Yours
truly, Bowden Bros. & Co., Ltd., Thursday Island.

A Democratic.barrister bo The Bulletin, on
the subject of “ A Muzzled Mandamus ” :
A dangerous bar to the assertion of public rights re-
vealed itself during the late Vic. Court discussion on the
claim of squatters in vermin-disi nets to put swing-gates
on public roads. 11l the assertion of private rights of
property, the House of Lords decided a few years ago
that, however malicious the motives of the property-
owner, he was entitled to his legal pound of flesh. And,
in regard to contraetoral rights, the same tribunal de-
cided similarly in the great trades-union strike case of
Allen v„ Flood. But.it seems that in applications for a
mandamus to compel a council or other body to perform
a public duty, the motives of the applicant, may be called
in question, and some-authorities would seem to go so far
as to say that the Court will deny a bond fi.de claim
for a public right, sucti as the right to use a public
road, if it 'is convinced that, the applicant is also
animated by feelings of malice -or revenge against
the robber of public rights. This is certainly not
as it should be. Mandamus is the only means by‘which
lethargic or corrupt public bodies can he spurred on to
do their duty to the public in a whole catalogue-of public
rights. And apathy with regard to such rights is so uni-
versal that the man whose passions or whose individual
interests lead him to demand (hat these rights be re-
spected; is, whatever his motives may be, in' sojne'sayt a
rare public benefactor. And in "such things as encroach-
ments on reserves and fencing roads, it would "be' hara fo
find in .any squatting district a man courageous enough to
face the undying enmity of a squatter, by setSirig the law
in motion against him, and at the same time not
by .feelings against the squatter that construed
into malice. ‘ Such a doctrine would really tend to en-
courage the unscrupulous to raid without fear the help-
less public. So far from I he-right to assert public rights
being hedged around with difficulties unknown to the
suitor in purely private matters, it should be free from
all difficulties whatever.

A Sydney theatrical column this week is
a mockery, and an emptiness, and a vacant cavern
full of Dibbs’s reasons for being a provincialist.
There hasn’t been a new show in the City of
Painted Rails for weeks, and the only old one of
any size is the evergreen “Geisha,” which still
trails its Japanese glories over the stage at Her
Majesty’s. For six solid weeks the Firm’s red
property sun has set nightly on that land of easy
virtue and podgy brown Flossies, and it is in-
tended to keep the Jap. play going all this month,
and probably a good part of next. On April 1
the “Geisha” will do its 100th consecutive night.
There are reports of a revival of “lolanthe” in
the far distance.

Fitzgerald Brothers’ circus opens at Red-
fern (Sydney) on Saturday, when our two old
friends, the lion and the elephant, will ride round
on the big tricycle in their usual reckless fashion.
The tiger that rides on the horse will appear on
the same date; and Ajax, the weird and wormy
one, who used to turn himself into strange boneless
reptiles at the Tivoli, has been added to the co.
since its last appearance. Various gutta-percha
ladies who fall from dizzy heights and bounce up
again, and a number of new performing animals,
and all the usual horse performances, besides some
unusual ones, are on the programme. That frail
and apologetic little beast which is put down as a
bunyip, in the absence of any evidence to the con-
trary, gets a line to himself in the bill, where, by
reason of the doubts as to his identity, he totters
between inverted commas. The circus has been
considerably enlarged since its last appearance in
Sydney, and brothers Daniel and Thomas begin to
wear the large corporation of a prosperous life,
and show other signs that portend the accumula-
tion of great wealth.
** * *
In the absence of any further law reports
about the fury of the American gentleman who
used to offer cocktails to the press of Sydney, it is
generally understood that the troubles of Dante
and his late partner have been settled. At all
events, Dante and manager Lohr are left in peace-
ful possession at the Palace, and the former draws
his spectral refreshment out of the empty drain-
pipe with the air of a man who has no troubles on
his mind, and his programme of strange appear-
ances and disappearances, and his bottle of in-
numerable drinks, and his other mysteries, hustle
along in a pleasant, light-hearted fashion. Dante’s
real name—as sworn to when the embittered
American gentleman wanted damages, or the
earth, or something—is Oscar Eliason, which would
look a good deal better on the bills, in The Bul-
letin’s opinion, than his professional cognomen.
At time of writing, Dante was doing his 81st
night in Sydney, which is a remarkable record for
a one-man show, and the glad smile on the skull
of the Burnt Woman—the smile which shows a
suspicion of gold-stopping in the skull’s back
tooth—is a visible sign of prosperity.

Jimmy Shields, the One-Legged Comedian,
whose absent limb was highly spoken of in Mel-
bourne, has joined the Sydney Tivoli co. Also,
the Howard Sisters have arrived, and Miss Cora
Caselli, whose prancing limbs aroused much ap-
proval on her previous visit, has come back to
prance some more.
** * *
Sydney Opera House opens on Saturday
with “Round the World in Eighty Days,” and
this paper hopes for the best. It has hoped for
the best at the same theatre on many previous
occasions, and been left, but it is still hoping.
** * *
The Criterion also re-opens on Saturday,
when George Rignold will produce “Othello.”
The Moor of Venice is nearly the only important
character that G.R. has never yet played in
public, and it seems a fair thing that this omission
should be repaired forthwith. Mr. Diver will do
the sinuous lago, and reach up to breathe sus-
picions in the ear of the towering Moor, and a pro-
mising company has been got together. And all
these strange, dreamy people who write long letters
to each other in the papers, whenever Shakespeare
is on, about the hidden meaning of a comma in
the 54th line of scene 16, or debate in two columns
whether some Shakespearean character was mad, or
only a lunatic, or whether he was an insane man
pretending t ) be deranged in order to disguise the
fact that he had lost his mind, are waking up
again. Most of them have already left off getting
their hair cut, and are cultivating a far-off expres-
sion, and have bought larger collars than usual.
No one really knows where these people lie torpid
when there is no Shakespearean drama on, but
when the warm Bard shines they become a great
and learned aggravation, and their moaning on
the bar is a depressing sound. Then the tide of
Shakespeare ebbs again, and all along the shore
great masses of erudition decompose in the sun,
and the critics get their hair cut and hibernate
once more. The man who resurrects the Bard in
Sydney has a great deal to answer for.
** * *
The Brough Co., which drew fairly good
business for “The Brixton Burglary,” is now
playing its positively last nights at Melbourne
Pnnoess a. The present season has been a pretty
constant financial improvement on Brough’s not too
encouraging season at the Bijou, nevertheless he is
quite decided on the point that the co. will not
return to Melbourne. For which matter they
would not be able to show again at either theatre
even if the manager were disposed to change his
plans. _ The bill for the remaining nights of the
week is “ Mrs. Tanqueray ” on Thursday, fol-
lowed by “ Dandy Dick ” and “ Niobe,” and any-
one who likes to see the last of the Broughs
in these three strikingly various plays will admit
that their versatile talent deserves a warmer ap-
preciation than it has earned of late. Australia is
apt to under-rate the artists whose mannerisms
have been before the public for many years. The
*®rm “old favorites” sounds satirical when ap-
plied to high-class comedians. Mr. and Mrs.
Brough, so far from benefiting by their popularity
m the past, are nowadays less admired for their
merits in a round of characters than they would
be if they were new arrivals, with no long list of
successes to their credit.
* * * *
On Easter Saturday the Firm will resume
active management of the Princess’s, and the
much-talked-about “Belle of New York” will
begin to boom.
££
At Melb. Royal they are putting “ The
White Heather ” through it's sixth week, and the
family circle and gallery are becoming inured to
the awful heartlessness of Walter Baker ; neither
does the weird Scotch accent of their old friend
Brown shock them as it did. The Bulletin
has long ago forgiven Brown’s accent for the
sake of sundry little bits of parental feeling which
he displays in his office. There are about 65
different ways of patting a bairn’s head on the
stage, and Brown’s way is the best. In fact, the
converted low-comedian seems so unobtrusively
natural in his bearing and bye-play that he may
be recommended to apply for the‘billet of kind
father in Bland Holt’s co. as a permanency. In
his more usual character of a jilted policeman, a
fraudulent bookmaker, or a hard, unflinching mer-
chant, Brown is comparatively wasted, but he can
bow a sorrowful head and drop a silent tear against
any actor of his size and weight.
** * *
Fred Poplar and Kitty Wager are the
latest re-arrivals at the Bijou residence of
Rickards, the bill otherwise being very like what
it was last week. Also,' the Alexandra is closed,
and the Opera House is in course of destruction,
the same as usual, and nothing out of the ordinary
way seems likely to happen anywhere except a
mixed entertainment at the Exhibition Building in
aid of a hospital. A renowned German pianist, with
long hair, is understood to be coming to Melbourne
presently, but he is not expected to start opera-
tions this side of the Holy Bun period.
At Poverty Point.
Justice Simpson’s order that the stage-name of peti-
tioner Daly should not be published raises a question as to
whether any ordinary divorce petitioner would be en-
titled to take proceedings under an alias, if he wished to
keep his identity secret. An actor is known to the world
only by his stage-name. For all purposes of publication
his family name is an alias.
‘‘Shifter” : Miss Mary Weir, now under the legal foot-
hghts, was a child pupil of Mrs. O. B. W. Lewis (Rose
Edouin) in Melb., one of her comrades being demised
Ohnssie Peachey, who married George Darrell. Mary
decided her vocation was dancing, and after being harle-
quina in a Royal Pantomime, she went to London to pick
up tricks. Her row with Alice Lethbridge at Melbourne
Princess’s is historical. Rehearsing the “ Forty Thieves ”
Mary tried the Serpentine, and Alice saw she herself was
a goner ” if the Australian girl got that slap at the
stalls. So the managerial ban was put on Mary ; but
most mysteriously she bounded on at night and brought
down the house 1 If Mr. Williamson persists in declaring
it was without his knowledge, let him be credited. Any-
how, Mary did not get another chance till Lethbridge
and Lonnen went.
Fred. J. Broomfield, of Sydney, is writing a four-
act drama for George Rignold, with Paul Kruger as
the central character. The masterful Oom Paul, washed
and civilised, and with his hair cut, would make a grand
central figure for a military play, and Broomfield takes
the liberty of washing Paul, in which matter he does old
Kruger a much-needed kindness.
In a side-show in George-street, Sydney, a beautifully
painted damsel, clothed after the 'fashion of a ballet
dancer, reclines in the shop window with a fan in her
hand and a bewitching smile on her countenance. She is
a big attraction, too. But think of the agony of smiling
all day in a shop window ! After a few hours of it, the
struggle to beam the same old happy radiance on the
170th Johnny must be like the effort to haul a loaded
dray uphill.
William Simpson, the variety-man, who was burnt to
death at Broken Hill, was a miner by day and stage-
performer at night. For his latter work he got £1 per
week, less expenses. The Gaiety Hall, where the tragedy
occurred, is one of those places where the show is “ given
a\vay with a pint of beer.” You buy your beer—and
drink it;. and the barmaid hands you a ticket for the
hall, which is next door.
The wife of a well-known Australian actor, having re-
lieved her feelings by smacking the other lady's face
seems to have gone away somewhere to nurse her jealousy’
and brood over the fact that hubby made her apologise
to the face of the other lady.
The meaning of some of “The White Heather” lines
doesn’t strike a melodrama audience on this side of the
world. For instance, when the duke’s sister (Mrs.
Blandolt) comments on the “ well-bred ” appearance of
the small child in the first act, and the old nurse remarks
that there are many such youngsters knocking around the
Heelands, the dook’s relative looks discreetly down at
her boots and says, “ I have heard so.” The reference is
of course, to the number of “illegitimates” fathered by
grouse-shooting lords and such. ' A late lamented prince
is said to have freely distributed his favors among the
Scottish lassies, and his good-looking features are now
“all over the shop.”
Dear Bulletin.— l am not “ wholly at sea” instating
that the “ faculty of distinguishing musical pitch ” can
be acquired. I also speak from personal experience
(though not of 30 years’ duration, perhaps), and am just
as likely to know what I am talking about as your other
correspondents, seeing that I come of a very musical
family, and have lived in an “atmosphere” of music all
my life. About six persons possessing the “ rare faculty”
have been quoted in your columns; I could instance fuily
six others, including three members of my own family. I
do not remember being able to tell the pitch of a note as
a child, so conclude I have acquired the faculty by subse-
quent familiarity with musical sounds. Ido not say any-
one can acquire it; but any musician with an accurate
ear can. Others support me in this view.—T.A.B. [Any
more letters on this weary subject will be used as pipe-
lights.—Ed. B.]
How old is Billy Jones, the veteran circus-ringmaster ?
Writer remembers him, as far back almost as he can
reach, with Burton. If it is the same Billy, he was then
a rather fleshy acrobat, with that easy, india-rubber
efficiency generally noticed in stout men. Walter Aircy
was then clown, and Burton himself, I think, juggled
with knives, balls, plates, etc. I remember these three
best, and it was my first circus. Airey belonged to Tas.,
and not long ago his brother, Bill, an old Brandy Creek
(Tas.) miner, made the fatal mistake of swallowing a dose
of carbolic acid for gin.
“ 8.E.” : The Bulletin in a recent par. advises Clement
Scott, during his forthcoming Australian lecture-tour,
not to pose as the “great” critic of London D.T. It
also calls him “a pompous adulator of managers and
mummers,” points the finger of scorn at his writings ever
having been really “ free and independent,” and winds up
by accusing him of having always “ sat at the profes-
sion’s feet.” Let’s see, wasn’t it C. Scott who wrote (in
effect) that no actress was, or could be, virtuous, and was
cursed throughout all Buskinland for writing it? [Didn’t
he take it all back and apologise later on ?— Ed. B.] That
looked like sitting at the profession’s feet, didn’t it? Now,
the present scribbler does not admire Scott, he much pre-
fers G. B. Shaw’s critiques, but —fair’s fair. Has the
writer of above-mentioned par. ever read any of the
theatrical criticisms (\) which appeared in London papers
prior to Scott’s debut in the Weekly Dispatch and Lon-
don Figaro ? If not, he’d better read ’em. Scott's
articles were sledge-hammery, and he certainly didn’t
“adulate” either managers or mummers. Quite the
contrary. Clement Scott was the pioneer of “ free ”
dramatic criticism, which was not subservient to the
advts., and didn’t care a hang for anybody. Many have
followed in his footsteps, but, as the leader of them all,
Scott was, and is, entitled (more than some) to the
epithet “ great.”
Apropos “ Three Musketeers.” The day before the
death of Dumas he said to his son : “ Tell me, Alexandrej
as a critic and a brother artist, is there anything of mine
that will live ? ” “ Yes ! ” said Alex., “ ‘ The Musketeers,’
for ever! ”
“Shifter”: D’Artagnan, in the “ Three Musketeers,”
owes some London vogue to being- so like Cyrano de Ber-
gerac. Clarence Holt, Bland’s dad, was immensely
popular as D’Artagnan, in Melb. When in management
with Hoskins, Clarence would say, “ * Hamlet,’ I suppose,
for Saturday night ? ” Billy: “No, Clarence, the good
old * Three Musketeers.’ ”
Young Sydney Smith, the smart boy who plays The
Urchin in Brough’s “ One Summer’s Day,” is the nine-
year-old son of a Princess’s stage-hand.

W. O. Hodgkinson, explorer and late Q.

Madame Radalyski (who has been re-

and will soon be exhausted.
Had Barton instead of Reid “ negotiated ”
the schedules to the Commonwealth Bill, one-half
the sting would have been taken out of the pre-
sent logomachy. The centre of the engagement
now consists in comparing pro-schedules Reid with
anti-Bill Reid, and thus countless points intended
to tell against the Bill and the schedules are logi-
cally only effective when directed against the anti-
Bill and pro-schedules Premier.
John Norton, after being about a week in
the little bagman city of Brisbane at the south-
east coast of Bananaland, reports that that pro-
vince (668,000 square miles of it) is dead against
Federation. Also, he says that not one Queens-
land elector in 10,000 has even heard of the
Enabling Bill. As he can’t be sure of that with-
out having first interviewed 86,869 electors, scat-
tered over 668,000 square miles, and ascertained
that they don’t know anything of the Bill, this
looks a large order. But'the world knows John
as a strictly accurate man who never makes frantic
statements or uses wild language with a head on it.

John See, M.L.A. (N.S.W.), on one aspect
of the Federal question :
I have just returned from Melbourne, and during my
stay there I certainly did not hear anything which would
lead me to suppose that they regard'the question of the
Federal capital as anything of very vital importance.
They look at the question from a practical point of view,
holding that the capital should be fixed for the conveni-
ence of the Commonwealth, and not for the aggrandise-
ment of any State. As to the talk about Victorian jealousy
of N.S. Wales, I saw none of it. It seems to me that
people who talk about the jealousy of Victoria are simply
looking for a bogey with which to knock the Federal
movement over. Some of the Anti-Federalists appear to
think that Victorians have some design on hand to secure
some special monopoly or advantage for themselves. I
did not see anything of the kind. I consider that those
who talk of having the Federal capital in Sydney take a
very narrow view of the whole question. The capital is
for the Commonwealth —not for any particular colony.
Hobart Mercury : r ,
This direct antagonism (over the site of the Federal
capital) between the two principal mainland cities, a
contest of municipal mountains, has not been neglected
or lost sight of by the municipal mole-hills. . . . Hobart
ceitamly has not yet lifted up its voice again in that
respect, though it might very well.
Then follows a column of reasons why Hobart
should be chosen as the Federal capital, thus
giving point to the “ municipal molehills ” gibe.
A few noisy Q. Democrats at Bundaberg
and elsewhere howled down their opponents’ re-
presentatives—a silly proceeding at best. The
Govt, press is highly indignant at this denial of
liberty of speech to its darlings, and fulminates
accordingly. This was the same good, old, libertv-
loving Press that bolstered up the Q.N. Bank
concealments; that backed up the Govt, in striking
112 names off the Barcoo roll ; that silenced
Democratic M’sL.A. by refusing to print a line of
their speeches. And it clamors for “ liberty of
speech'! ”
S. A. Parliament passed the Federal Enab-
ling Bill without amendment. The Assembly was
friendly, and in the Council that weariest of
bores, Ebenezer Ward, cursed against, Australian
union practically all by himself. S.A. will also
be first with the referendum, which will be taken
in a few weeks along with the general election.
And here Kingston playt* into the hands of the
N.S.W. obstructionists^a mistake which the
patient and worldly-wise Turner has avoided ; for
when S.A. accepts the Bill the boss-liars of the
N.S.W. provincial party will point to its accept-
ance as evidence that necessitous S.A. sees its way
to make great boodle out of the scheme at the ex-
pense of the fat, rich, good-natured Cornstalk.
S.A. grape-growers, largely German, com-
plain bitterly that the wine-makers will not give
more than 30s. a ton for any but a very choice
sort or two of their produce. In one important
vine-district they held a meeting to consider the
situation ; and, after several speeches in mixed
English and German, somebody suggested an
association. “You mean a union,” some other
body interjected ; and he said, he did. Whereat
the meeting paled with horror. Of course, in
those circumstances, they resolved that all they
could do. was to go home and heave strange oaths
at the wine-makers. Yet, curiously enough, when
somebody else at the same meeting suggested that
the Govt, should supply the. growers with arti-
ficial manures free, the meeting didn’t pale any-
thing-worth .mentioning.
Sydney Daily Telegraph (March 16)
Because a considerable section of the people of this
colony show an indisposition to accept without question
and gladly the Federal agreement arrived at bv the
secret meeting of Premiers, the Melbourne Age cannot
find terms of opprobrium hard enough to apply to them.
Daily Telegraph (March 17)
The strongest encouragement given to Mr. Reid for
continuing the policy of bustle and bluff very appropri-
ately came from Melbourne. The natural anxiety of that
city to have the Conference Bill rushed through and the
sacrifice of N.S.W. completed before the people realise
what is being done induced the Melbourne press yester-
day to urge the Premier into trying a coup d’etat. . . .
In its indecent eagerness to finger the spoil, Melbourne
may very easily counsel our Premier to attempt dicta-
torial action, but it could not give him much help in
carrying it through. ... A Melbourne-directed assault
on the constitutional rights of N.S.W. will consequently
not come off just yet, and the bared teeth and whetted
appetites of the expectant land-boomsters must be kept
under restraint for at least a little longer.
Daily Telegraph (March 18)
Mr. Reid came back from his secret visit to the brewery
of the five drunkards with a Federal stagger, etc.
Taking them all round, however, the N.S.W.
anti-Federalists have been very restrained in their
language. They started a year ago by calling the
Melbournians and the people of all the four
southern and western provinces thieves, wolves
and robbers, and a few things like that, and they
have kept on at it ever since, but, on the whole,
the N.S;W. provincialists have been very gentle-
manly.
The combustible town of Kalgoorlie (W. A.)
has some kind of a fire-brigade—mostly crippled
for want of water—but no salvage corps. Every-
body takes a hand at the salvage business when a
big fire happens, and the amateur salvage corps is
a fearful and wonderful affair. It begins in a
wild state of excitement and grows wilder and
madder as it goes on, till it bursts open every
house and shop in the street where the fire is
located, and in the next three streets as well, and
throws the stock and the cash and the proprietor’s
baby 40ft. in the air, and lets them come down
whack, and then treads them in the mud and
leaves them there while it rushes off and bene-
volently, wrecks some more premises—all with a
view to saving the goods from destruction. At
the last big fire in Kalgoorlie the amateur salvage
corps worked nobly without hope of reward,
and broke nearly everything within a quarter-
mile ,of the conflagration. But it is much the
sande every where. Rockhampton (Q.) used to be
given over to these unobtrusive benefactors,
but one night a judicious jeweller with a
gun. so damped their ardour that the amateur
salvagers pretty well dropped the business.
The usual fire was on, and the well-meaning
crowd had cleaned out the adjacent grocery,
which was in practically no danger ; and some of
them had saved the kippered herrings by carrying
them home, and the rest had saved the eggs by
heaving them into the road under the boots of the
multitude. Then they rushed to rescue the
jewellery shop next door by hurtling the gold
watches and the bangles through the air; but the
owner biffed the two foremost benefactors in the
eye, and then swore to fire promiscuously among
the kind-hearted crowd with a navy revolver if it
didn’t disperse. It dispersed accordingly, but the
letters it wrote to the papers about the ingratitude
of that jewellery man (whose shop never took fire
at all) in not allowing his stock to be thrown into
the street were very severe indeed.

Briseis Tin-M. Co. (Tas.): Some hope of share-
holders benefiting by the little tin-boom. Admitted at a
meeting in Melb. lately that, for 15 years, the mine had
been “eking out a miserable existence ” owing to want
of funds. Also, openly confessed that, as soon as there
was some prospect of a sale being made, shares rose on
the Exchange. Mr. R. Curtis came from Sydney to tell
the shareholders that, “ considering the present pre-
dicament, they need not think themselves unfor-
tunate in passing the mine into the hands of
another set of men.” Intended to say a lot more
about the management, but would content himself by
moving a set of resolutions, the most important of which
authorised the sale for £150,000 cash and a j fully paid-up
interest in a London co. having a working capital of not
less than £40,000. Said if these resolutions were not
carried shareholders would have to “tap themselves” for
a further £30,000 or £40,000. Resolutions carried unanim-
ously. The optionist had agreed,to put up £lOOO deposit
on the deal, but magnanimously, agreed to make it £2OOO,
for which a six months’ option has been given, with the
right of another three months for another £lOOO. Meet-
ing then adjourned for drinks, during which bonder said
he was sure the flotation would be a success, and the
bonded replied that they hoped so, too, and gave many
assurances of support to carry the deal through. Every-
body appreciated everything but the humor of the situa-
tion. The cash means £2 10s. a share, and after the
meeting the market —“ finished strongly at 355. 11 ”

Manager “Tom” Dibbs, of the Commercial
Banking Co. of Sydney, at that anti-Bilious meeting where
his long and cumbersome ex-Republican brother presided,
advanced as one reason why the Federal capital should
be in Sydney that the bank deposits and advances and
note-circulation of N.S.W. were larger than those of Vic-
toria. He might also have added that N.S.W. had a
bigger mountain than any in Victoria, but he probably
forgot. Why the province with the largest note-circula-
tion or the largest mountain or the longest ex-Premier
should claim special concessions, any more than the one
with the biggest wheat-crop or the largest desert or the
greatest export of hides, the two ponderous brothers ex-
plained not. And while pointing out that N.S.W. had
£375,000 more note-issue than Victoria—in other words,
thatthebanks werethatmuch more in debt —T.Dibbsquite
failed to mention that Victoria has £940,000 more actual
coin, which possibly counts for something. The fact that
Dibbs’s bank, or any other N.S.W. bank, owes an awful
amount for the redemption of its paper money has nothing
very obvious to do with the location of the Federal capital
in any case.

The Westralian Govt, announces that 3J per
cent, stock can be bought daily at par at Perth Treasury.
The Forrest Ministry has already floated loans with all the
banks that seemed to want its Treasury Bills, and raised
half-a-million from the A.M.P. Society, and it has bor-
rowed just about as much in England as Bull seems
inclined to stand, so an appeal to the local public was
inevitable. The most significant fact is that W.A. seems
to have given up trying to raise the wind at 3 per cent.
Its credit isn’t equal to it, and it admits the fact,
and it is time some of the other provinces did likewise,
Probably the 3}4 per cent, will attract some cash from
Sydney and Melbourne and Adelaide ; all the money that
Perth subscribes on its own isn’t likely to be much.

Westralia has doubled the rate of commission
on post-office orders —a P. 0.0. for any sum from Is. to £2
now costs Is. 6d. commission instead of the former 9d.
This is an attempt to stop the outflow of money, so far as
the small people are concerned. The people who send
little sums by P. 0.0. are miners and the like remitting
something of their scanty wages to the children or the
old woman in other provinces, and Big John wants to
check these outgoings. But 20 times as much goes out
through the banks to pay dividends to English share-
holders and money-lenders, and that outflow can only be
reached by an export duty on gold—the increase of 9d.
on small P.O. orders (supposing that nobody took
out an order for less than £2) would equal an ex-
port gold duty of Is. 6d. per ounce. As it is it
probably equals 2s. And Big John shows no sign
of taxing the big outflow, or levying on the big people
who take £500,000 at a time out of W.A. But when he
finds a man sending £1 to the old woman, John comes
down on him like 1000 bricks with a view to keeping that
£1 in the country. Of course in the absence of a gold
export duty the only result is that the banks can do the
work at a cheaper rate, and the post-office order business
is falling off tremendously.

The W.A. Government cut down its expendi-
ture for February, ’99, to £185,440 (£98,153 less than the
expenditure for February, ’9B), so, despite the sorely-
diminished revenue, there was a surplus for the month of
£17,634. The expenditure for January and February,
’99, was £185,114 less than that for the first two months
of ’9B. Forrest is retrenching with a big axe these times,
and it is no wonder the Sandgroper civil-servant is being
cast wholesale on a hard world to go dry-blowing for a
maintenance.

The Standard Fire and Marine Insurance Co.
of Maoriland had a slightly better year, the profit for 1898
being £4373. A dividend of 6i per cent, absorbs £4687
10s., so again the Standard goes back —this time by £314.
The proceedings of this co. for the last few years have
been as follows;
Profit. Dividend.
1891 .. £9,768 .. per cent. = £5625
1892 .. 17,908 .. 10 „ = 7500
1893 .. 11,751 10 „ = 7500
1894 .. 8,176 ... 10 „ = 7500
1895 .. 5,134 7$ „ = 6625
1896 .. 5,822 .. 7J „ = 5625

Profit.
1898 .. 4,373 6i „ =. 4687
Profit £58,060 Dividends £47,812
After writing off £4OOO in 1892 for depreciation of securi-
ties, the result is that the funds have increased by £6248
in eight years.. Still the Standard is a much smaller
affair than it was at the end of 1894 ; during the last four
years, through paying dividends that were only partly
earned or not earned at all, its funds have diminished by
about £9OOO. The most reckless proceeding of all was the
raising of the dividend again from the 5 per cent, of ’97
to 6J per cent, in ’9B. After dropping more than £B6O0 —
a tremendous sum to a comparatively small co. like the
Standard —in ’97, the board of directors which would
deliberately encroach on the already depleted funds by
paying away £3OO more than the earnings in order to
raise the 1898 div. from 5 to 6| per cent., is the sort of
board which ought to be fired out of office with all pos-
sible speed. In fact, it might reasonably have been
ejected a year ago when it paid the dividend for the
second half of ’97 out of the reserve-fund. The only
other notable feature about the balance-sheet is that the
Standard describes most of its assets simply as “ Invest-
ments, 162,308,” which is as small a mass of information
as could well be put in one line.

The New York Life Insurance Co. .ssues its
report for 1898 —the 54th year of its existence. Its
Sremium income was £7,059,740, being £528,811 more
lan last year’s figures. Interest on investments was
£2,016,076, being £204,067 more than last year. Total
income was £9,348,131, and of this the New York Life Co.
saved and added to its funds £3,072,626, making the total
funds £44,433,089. This is a good-sized pile, and the
surplus of assets over liabilities is £1,774,345. According
to United States law, all U.S. life companies, in
making up these elaborate calculations, whereby a life
00. finds out whether it has or has not burst in the night,
must assume that their assets will realise not more than 4
?er cent, interest in the future, and on this basis the New
ork Life has a surplus of £7,793,452. But the manage-
ment, on its own account, has cut down its interest
estimates to 3 per cent., thereby greatly reducing
the sensational surplus on paper, but making things
vastly safer for policy-holders. Among Australasian com-
panies there isn’t one which travels on the 3 per cent,
estimates, and there is only one other foreign office doing
business in these provinces which adopts this eminently
desirable precaution. In addition to this the New York
Life Co. publishes a complete list of its assets—every
separate stock and mortgage and bit of land °su? r , * , J
mortar which goes to make up its £44,000,000 of assets
with the value set against each ; also the certificate or a
State auditor who announces that he has not only,
audited .the accounts and looked to the accuracy ol
the additions and subtractions, but that he has
examined into the values of these assets and found
them fully worth the prices set against them. No
Australasian co., except the Maonland Government
Department, has any State audit to guarantee that its
assets are worth their alleged value. And not one Aus-
tralasian co. issues a complete statement of its assets, so
the public has to take a great deal for granted.
The New York Life Co. has written more than
£300,000 off the book value of its real estate, with a view
to making it yield 4 per cent, on its book value, which is
another commendable act of caution. In fact, barring its
heavy expense rate (nearly 20 per cent, of total income)
there is nothing in the New York Life Co.’s present
balance-sheet which isn’t commendable. And the Ameri-
can style of life insurance, which consists so largely of
short-dated tontine policies, seems to make a high
expense rate inevitable.

In Westralia to-day all the signs are reminiscent
of the conditions that prevailed in Melbourne six years
ago before the financial institutions began to fall like card
houses. The same sinister rumours that could not be
stifled, the same official contradictions of “ unfounded
slanders,” the same strained business relations between
merchants and bankers, the same declaration of divi-
dends, the same frantic efforts on the part of traders to
get in cash. Like conditions do not always lead to like
results—but if The Bulletin had any stock in any institu-
tion wholly identified with W. A., it would keep its eyes
open.

The Chillagoe Railway and Mines, Limited, has
started to raise the wind in a rather expensive fashion by
the issue of £400,000 worth of 6 per cent, debentures.
This is the concern which has got a 50 years’ lease of 2000
acres of land at Chillagoe (N.Q.), said land being sup-
posed to be rich in copper and other things ; and which
is building a railway 103 miles long to connect its pro-
perty with the Govt, line near Cairns. The prospectus
sets forth that it has already issued 600,000 shares fully
paid up to £2, but the paid capital is to be reduced to
600,000 shares of £1 each ; so that half the present alleged
paid-up capital is to disappear. The debentures have a
20 years’ currency, and, in addition to the 6 per
cent, interest, the holders are to have the right
of exchanging them, at any time before Ist April,
1902, for shares, at the rate of a £1 share for
each 30s. invested in debentures. If Chillagoe proves
a great success, and the £1 shares go up to £2 or
£3 or £5 each within the next three years, the debenture
holders will, of course, convert unanimously. If some of
them don’t convert, and the co. wants to pay them off
before 1919 and get rid of the heavy interest liability, it
can do so any time after 1909 —giving them £llO for each
£lOO invested. Also the first three years’ interest (£72,000)
has already been deposited in the bank in the name of
trustees. Altogether, the Chillagoe Co., if it really has a
great and assured success on hand, is buying
money at a rather high price. The holder of £3OO worth
of debentures is offered : (1) £lB a year interest, the first
three years’interest (£54) deposited in advance; (2) the
chance of con verting into 200 fully paid shares which may
be worth £5OO or £lOOO ; (3) the chance of being paid off
after ten years with £3O bonus. And if things go wrong
the debenture holders have a first mortgage on the rail-
way and everything else. Still, as the co.’s shares are
fully paid up, the properties are the only thing that the
debenture-holders have to fall back upon, and if the
mines did fail the line would be a line to nowhere in par-
ticular, and might be not quite the asset it looks. In fact,
it might be mostly grief and old iron. Possibly the Chil-
lagoe debentures are not quite the dazzling affair they
look.

“ Pyrrhotite ” : Charters Towers is a striking
example of a goldfield developed by local capital to the
practical exclusion of J. Bull. The latter’s emissaries
generally get hold of the best things in the way of pay-
able mines—also a goodly proportion of bad ones. On the
•owers, however, Bull’s foothold has never been strong,
jo the bulk profits of many years’ successful operations
have been retained locally. These have been re-employed
in extracting the metal from mother earth, and success
has consistently followed. There comes a climax, how-
ever, in every field’s history when it is a question of intro-
ducing outside assistance or witnessing decline. This
brings us back to the inevitable Bull again, for there is a
limit to local magnates’ spending powers when deeper
levels are taken in hand. Will be interesting to watch
how Bull responds. He has had quite enough of ex-
ploring the outskirts, whither he was conducted by
local promoters, and he will now be asked to de-
termine unknown areas lying underfoot. Becent ex-
periences are not calculated to make him keen on the
subject, but, probably, a wholesome consideration in the
matter of “ terms ” will achieve the desired object.
Would appear from this that future of Charters Towers
will be largely one of John Bull and gradual elimination of
old identities. The latter are quite conscious of their
past accomplishments and resent the looming of Bull on
the horizon. They have grown wealthy and would, doubt-
less, have become duly stodgy with favorable climatic
conditions. Are characterized by total absence of affecta-
tion, great perseverance in mining matters, and utter dis-
regard for attractiveness of surroundings or physical im-
provement of town. Thus no attempt at permanent side-
walks, recreation ground or architectural design. Muni-
cipally, things at a standstill. All this destined to receive
a shaking up with advent of Bull, whose coming will be
welcomed by the advanced minority. Probably, then
some tributary districts now languishing will receive
adequate attention. These, notably Eavenswood with its
rich complex ores and, Mt. Success, warrant exploitation
but have been neglected owing to concentration of local
capital in the Towers. To extend the mining industry in
these parts, foreign money must be introduced and receive
the co-operation of resident mining men. Fields like
Charters Towers, which yield continuous and payable re-
turns on small working capitals even in N.Q., are not dis-
covered every day. People here seem to have cultivated
tropic apathy towards future potentialities, and the press
might take a few hints from some of the other provinces
in matter of advertising their mineral resources. Figures
alone are dry facts when unaccompanied by explanations.
[The Bulletin publishes the above mainly as a
shocking example of the Australian tendency to lie down
and howl for “ foreign capital.” Even if the above theory
were correct, which it isn’t, it only amounts to a state-
ment that a choice lies between letting the gold go to
England now, or waiting till some day or other Australian
capitalists tackle the neglected reefs of North Queensland
and get the gold out for the benefit of Australia. There
is no period in the history of any Australian goldfield
when Australian enterprise can’t do the needful work
just as well as the British article. The theory that
Bull will make new sidewalks and fill the Towers
with improved architecture—that the advent of a few
dozen foreign managers, who have no interest in the
place except to pay the lowest possible wages, and drag
out all the available gold, so as to cover the ruinous ex-
penses of London management and pay divs. on a ridicu-
lously inflated capital, will make any perceptible differ-
ence in municipal affairs—is pitiable bosh. The most
lamentable mining centre of any tize in Auitralia i« Kal-
goorlie, where Bull Is supreme. The best one is Bendigo,
where the Australian looks after his own business.
British management has wrecked many a good mine by
loading it with an impossible capital and piling up ex-
penses—not the wages to Australian workmen, for they
are cut down to the lowest possible figure, but the salaries
of the ornamental robbers in London—but it has never
made a bad mine into a good one, or an old mine into a
new one. And'it never will. Will the unpatriotic fool
minority—the “advanced minority” it has the cheek to
call itself—at the Towers please note.]

Mt. Morgan residents are at present optimists
of dangerous and contagious enthusiasm. The North Mt.
Morgan is in formation showing stone similar to the
Linda lode, and may get the reef “any minute”—if the
Light o’ Day, on the other side of the Mount, doesn’t get
it first. A strong Rockhampton syndicate is sinking a
shaft 1000 ft. to test the outlying ground. Two claims at
Crocodile are “looking well.” Copper in “lodes of
gigantic proportions ” has been found at Mt. Alexander.
The Council is starting a scheme of sanitary cremation.
And the Mayor has fallen out of his bread-cart and es-
caped unhurt. The intelligent resident sees in all these

The best feature of the newly-discovered ore in
the Consols mine, 8.H., is that it occurs more regularly
than at the higher levels, where the slugs could be hardly
more relied upon than nuggets in gold-alluvial. The

ised, Bull-owned property) enthusiastically talks of 10
years’ life as assured; but three months hence will be
time enough to form estimates of this sort.

B.H. Junction directors have been telling an
Adelaide Judge and jury a great deal more than share-
holders have been permitted to know. While Chairman
Howe was at the Federal Convention in Adelaide, his col-
leagues entered into an agreement for the sale of concen-
trates. Howe denounced it as “ ruinous,” and spent a
good deal of time afterwards stalling-off an action for
damages for non-fulfilment of another contract. Howe
and one director, it appeared, mostly pulled together;
the rest pulled the other way. Things climaxed, during
a visit to the mine, in a snapping of fingers in the face,
exchange of such compliments as “ hypocrite,” “ bully,”
“ cur,” “ ignoramus,” and “ tinker,” some “ stoush,” and
an action for £lOOO damages for assault by Howe upon
Beaglehole. Verdict for defendant. Since then share-
holders have been looking for some reference to this
“ ruinous contract” in. the last report; but they can’t
find it.
The disclosures during the Howe-Beaglehole
trial in Adelaide are not likely to make Australian share-
holders in the Junction feel any more comfortable. A
syndicate (whose name in private life is mostly Isaac
Wolfenstein) is reported to hold about half the co.’s shares,
or a trifle more ; same syndicate is interested in Australian
ore-reducing works and ore-shipping enterprises. Nothing
is wrong about this, of course ; in fact, the arrangement
might be advantageous to Australian shareholders. On

Paddy Lackey, N.S.W. :—Two years ago
there was talk of the purchase of this mine by a
London crowd who had put up over £2OOO to bond it, but
they forfeited that £2OOO because there was no boom on
in London. Owners (a Salvation Army crowd, if you
please) then started to sink a new main shaft, have opened
out at 500 ft., driven 180 ft. north, and had first crushing
from the stopes recently—2oo tons, 1990 z. I7dwt., leaving
6dwt. in the tailings. Erecting cyanide plant for these.
Owners write : “The stopes show a good reef from the
shaft in and there is a splendid reef in face of drive.”
This, worked for many, many years, is one of the few con-
sistent gold-mines in N.S.W., and the men who did not
buy it when they got the chance did not know their
business.

Cobar-Chesney:—Cutting down shaft, making
it wider and 3ft. longer. Tailings sold to Gudgeon and
Hunt, of the Young Australia, where they are cyanided.
Average contents nearly 6dwt. ; over 20,000 tons in heap,
about half of which contains too much copper for cyani-
dation. Buyers will probably make a fair thing out of
one-half at 10s. 6d. a ton, and leave the balance for the
co. to work in with their smelting ores later on.
• • * •
The Chesney-Cobar directors object to The
Bulletin’s criticism of their management of the mine.
Here is a sample of it. The old Chesney tailings
have, as above stated, been sold to Gudgeon and
party at 10s. fid. per ton, and it is “ officially
anticipated” that at least 10,000 tons will be taken.
The average worth is estimated at over fidwt. per
ton. The 10,000 tons, on this estimate, will be worth
£12,000. The lot is to be sold for £5250. Having engine-
power and pumps at the tailings-site, the Chesney Co.
could erect a cyanide plant for about £6OO, and, judging
by the Occidental experience, the cost of treatment ought
not to exceed 3s. 4d. per ton, or £l5OO. The account
would stand thus : Cr. —Value of 10,000 tons tailings,
£12,000. Dr.—Plant and cost of treatment, £2100;
balance, profit, £9900. This is what has been sold at
£6250. And that is the sort of management which one
should commend 1

Great Boulder Co. has been freed from the

make a reasonable arrangement for introducing some
other process.” Konemann has shipped to England “to

“ The money expended on the installation of
the Koneman plant will not be altogether wasted. Mr.
Hamilton, the manager in possession, will alter it as
promptly as possible and begin the treatment of tailings
by whichever is the best way. The co. will have the free
use of the plant.” How consoling?—the free use of a
plant admitted to be an ignominious failure and for which
the co. has also had the pleasure of paying to the extent
of £20,000. Directorial inspiration seems to permeate
these pars. Money not altogether wasted ! The plant is to
be worked as the manager thinks best, and .the tailings
are now to be treated in the best possible way. Are any
of the deluded shareholders gulls enough to think that
this can be done for nothing? The Boulder directors
entered into this rascally contract months before it was
known, and then it leaked out. They went ahead in face
of warnings, and when it could have been cancelled with,
out loss; they proclaimed its success before the process
' v *® tested, and now, when concealment is impossible,
talk about the money not being altogether wasted. Same

Of 100,5650 z. gold exported from Westralia in
February, 66,3990 z. went direct to London, 44,106£0z. to
Melbourne, and 59£oz. to Adelaide. Apropos, a corres-
pondent writes to The Bulletin wanting to know the
respective values of the Queensland and Westralian gold-
production for ’9B. This paper can’t tell; and nobody
else knows either with enough accuracy to swear to.
Some approximate figures may be obtained ; but, speaking
generally, this is one of the weakest spots in Australian
mineral statistics. For instance, this 56,3990 z. exported
fromthe West in February has been lost sight of, and
will hereafter be represented in sterling statistics by an
estimate—high or low, just as it suits the book of the man,
who makes it. Writer knows of a case in which the
declared value ” of a given quantity of metal of approxi-
mately equal intrinsic value differed so much within six
months that the maximum was 50 per cent, greater than
the minimum. And the only explanation given was that
it was “ politic ” to revise the basis of valuation.

Plunderderry Gold-mine, Coolgardie : Recon-
structed in London, capital reduced from £700,000 to
£70,000. Now remains for the gold to increase ten times
to straighten things out. Bought from the owners—with
four months to pay £lBO,OOO cash and a sixth interest,
and, before the money was paid, sold in London for
£417,000 cash, and a third of the shares in a £700,000 00.
Meanwhile the mine was carefully fenced in. The speci-
mens—Big Ben especially—were Worked for all they
were worth in London and Paris, after which they were
returned to the finders as they did not go with the mine.
What then happened the world knows. Again cabled
that Fingall and Myring have agreed to return their flota-
tion profits.
Some of the Kanowna “ lead ” claims are proving
more consistent than most of the wise men from the
quartz and telluride “ shows ” foretold. One, and that
not a specimen mine, has just had its fourth battery
clean-up ; 303oz. was got from 245 tons, bringing up the
total to 1585oz. from 903 tons. But another 500oz. will
about see the end of the dirt.
Bull’s taste for a comprehensive title has been

Westminster is said to have been hooked for-a £40,000 in-
terest. The local proposal is to work from the No. 1
South Clunes ground.

SOCIETY
Local gossip would indicate that the
souvenir-jewels presented by Sydney ladies trrex-
Gov. Hampden’? wife and daughters were far
from as expensive as hinted at the date of 1 hand-
ing over. The pretence and makerbelieve of such
ceremonies Would certainly be in keeping wjth
“society” insincerity. But Lady Hampden and
her daughters were lucky to get the things, what-
ever tljeir value, in their hands.at once. Other
Governors’wives who were profflised magnificent
souvenirs in the future got nothing or trifles.
Lady Denison, for instance, was assured of a-
representative-souvenir by the effusive dames and
damsels of Sydney, but told them not to hurry, as
they could send it to England after her. Dames'
and damsels accordingly rolled up and-read yards
of tear-wet addresses, and cried, “Oj mfilydy, we
will send you a souvenir from our heart of hearts ! ”
Months after, Lady Denison received an emu’s
egg set in silver !

With reference to a recent Bulletin allu-

from the ’9B Duel that the old gentleman was un-

If what Bishop Thornton, of Ballarat, and

propose to allow the constables to remain in the

to say that the Bench believed the constables and
fined the bishop. An altogether new element is
imported into the case by the declaration of the
lady, whose position will secure much credence
for her story.

The recent new appointments to the trust
of N.S. W. National Gallery are not too satisfac-
tory. Only one of the nominations —that of Mr.
Sulman, the well-known architect—can possibly
be defended, as there is not a single known art-
amateur among the rest. Why on earth it should
be necessary, in filling such positions, to look only
among stodgy politicians and their friends and
hangers-on, is indeed a mystery. A witty noble-
man—the only witty nobleman who has ever
visited Australia said that Sydneyites were
people who sat in 30-guinea- chairs and admired
30-shilling oleographs. A lot of such people get
on the Art trust. The story goes that at the first
meeting attended by the new trustees Allan Hut-
chinson’s bust of a Chinese was submitted for
sale ; but the newly-appointed politicians (or one
of them) said he wouldn’t consent to buying any
representation of a Chinaman. Art is long and
politics are short. Hutchinson’s bust will live
when those politicians are dead utterly, unless
Hutchinson condescends to immortalise them in—
well, brass would fit the occasion.

One of the Sydney debating-clubs—incu-

for and five minutes against each proposition.
.This should be soothing to Premier Reid. Imita-

commencing to rush along his tracks. The rising

arena well equipped “ from the jump.”

Chief Com. Chomley, of the Vie. police,
seems to have dropped a tear over the official
document in which he recommended that the
whole of the boot-box tragedy reward should go
to a person unconnected with the fooree. “He
saw no alternative,” he said—which (considering
that the terms of the Government proclamation
never admitted of an alternative) was a quite un-
called-for remark. Even the girl Dhbberke could
not have made out a legal claim to any of the
money, for her confession to the police was the
natural result of her previous confession to the
“ gentleman in Prell’s Buildings,” who practically
handed her over to the Law. As for the claims of
sundry detectives, they had no existence whatever
save in the crawlsome suggestions of newspaper-
reporters.
* • • •
The name of the real Pratt who captured
the boot-box boodle (.£550) was bound to come
out. A Melbourne paper had already given away
the “open secret ” in such a clumsy manner as to
cause grief and pain to the wrong individual, for
there are two Pratts with offices at Prell s Build-
ings, aiid the reckless rag in question contrived to
mix up their initials and identities. Pratt, the
friend of damsel Dubberke, is a young man of
ordinary worldly tendencies, whereas the other
Pratt is an elderly gentleman who takes a Sunday-
school class. After it was state din print that the
right Pratt ran the other man’s business and took
a lively interest in the church, life became unen-
durable for both Prates. Kerristian friends
started to denounce the innocent one as a whited old
sepulchre, whilst irreligious acquaintances twitted
the other Pratt with his alleged piety and said
they never would have believed it of him. Con-
sequently each Pratt felt that his reputation was
at stake. The real Pratt affected an unwilling-
ness to have his name published, but all the same
he was probably glad for the world to know the
difference between himself and his namesake who
teaches the story of Jonah and the whale.

The most hopeless claimant in the matter
of the Yarra boot-trunk unpleasantness was a
middle-aged gentleman who said he had been de-
ceived by the Government doctor and wanted
compensation for time spent in running after the
wrong woman. The doctor originally estimated
the age of the decayed head and the bones at 30
years, instead of 18, and t* e applicant thereupon
set to work making inquiries about middle-aged
women who were missing. The labor was thrown
away as a matter of course. Consequently the
applicant was much boot-leather out of pocket;
also some colonial beer spent in approaching
people who looked like the kind of people who
would know about a missing woman of 30, and
the ends of his pants bad become frayed and his
hat bleached in the search, to say nothing of loss
of time and bone-weariness. He wanted payment
for these things, but Premier Turner turned his
blank ear to the appeal, so another vote is lost for
next election.

The second Gatton inquiry is evolving
some strange information or hazy police legend.
The strangest deposition up to date is that of the
Gatton police-sergeant—the first bobby on the
scene of the murder —who declares that the only
tracks leading from the gate to the bodies, or
anywhere near the bodies, were those of the
Murphys’ cart and one horse—the old plate of
meat in the shafts. Yet there ought to have
been at least three sets of tracks, if not four or
five. The three essential ones were—(l) That of
the Murphys’ horse and cart arriving on the spot;
(2) That of the murderer getting away ; (3) That
of O’Neill when, as he alleges, he followed the
tracks of the cart next morning and found the
bodies. These three sets of tracks should haVe
been there to a dead certainty, but there were two
others which might reasonably have been ex-
pected—(l) That of the murderer arriving on the
spot, unless he arrived in the cart with the
Murphys, in which ease he would leave no sepa-
rate traces ; (2) the footprints of that hazy myth
that so many excitable people were prepared to
swear afterwards they saw waiting for his
three stalwart victims. The Gatton sergeant
declares that, to the best of his solid metho-
dical belief, none of these other tracks were there
—nothing but the traces of the old horse and the
cart with its wobbly wheel lumbering along to the
place where the victims got out and died. The
same officer states that he made a lot of notes at
the time, and lost them all afterwards, so that he
has to trust entirely to his memory ; also, that his
memory is better now than it was at the time, and
he can recollect things that he missed then.
Another thing which this remarkable bobby
remembers now is that the sliprails were not all
down, after all; two of them were down, but the
third was up or partly up. There were no foot-
prints of the man who put it up again after the
wobbly vehicle entered, so it looks as if the trap
had bumped over it. And, if so, there are more
doubts than ever about the wraith or banshee
waiting at the gate, for if that murky prowler had
been there with the plans of a deep-laid conspiracy
concealed in the lining of his hat, he would
probably have had the entrance to the paddock all
ready. And, besides, as already mentioned, the
constable who was first on the spot swears that he
saw no footmarks of any mysterious assassin lying
low outside the fence. There were footmarks
there when the black-trackers arrived, but by
then all the adjacent inhabitants had been stand-
ing round discussing the horror and making foot-
marks.
Same policeman says that, though M‘Neill told
him he had gone into the paddock and found the
bodies, and though he noticed no tracks showing
where M‘Neill had been anywhere near the
bodies, still he didn’t ask the said M‘N. any ques-
tions. Altogether, on his own evidence, the Gat-
ton sergeant looks like a good, solid, cast-iron
bobby, eminently fitted to arrest the heavy-weight
local drunk and take laborious notes in a large
book that the property found on him was one
strawberry-mark and a black eye.

“ Who did it ? ” as “ How many people are in the
know ? ”

In Ipswich (Q.) could recently have been

fourth Richard Burgess, with his wrists chained
to the saddle and ankles chained together under
the belly of the horse. Next came a burly, red-
faced detective, with his revolver very niuch in
evidence.; and finally, the sub-inspector in charge
of the “exploring expedition,” with the Mount
Walker resident who had acted as guide. To give
the devil his due, the prisoner looked bv far the
best horseman of the lot, and has evidently done
a deal of riding. Everybody along the route
quickly picked out “ Burgess ” before his trap-
pings were discernible, thus showing how easily a
man can be “identified ” after his photo, has been
scattered broadcast about the country in the news-
papers.

Most of the old-strike bitterness has died
a lingering death at Broken Hill; for one thing,
there has been an almost complete change of
managers since then. The companies still, how-
ever, apparently “ mark ’ men, and exchange
full descriptions of those so treated. A printed
form, duly filled in and signed by one manager
and addressed to another, lately came into the
possession of the Miners’ Association, was photo-
graphed, and a copy passed on to the Mines
Minister, who looked wise, and, of course, said lie
could do nothing. The cruellest part of the busi-
ness is that men thus black-listed are not informed
of it, but hang about for months, passing from
mine to mine. Then, their funds exhausted and
their credit gone, they find themselves in an
isolated district with only one industry, and that
closed to them.

N.S.W. Executive, in fixing the date of
execution of Stuart Briggs, the Petersham mur-
derer, gave him what is called the advantage of
two intermediate Sundays. Two Sundays is now
the generally-adopted N.S.W. period between an
Executive decision and the gruesome performance
of Nosey Bob. Ex-Premier Dibbs did much to
fix this period. There is no law, and not much
rhyme or reason, in making the interval any more
than one week or a few days —unless it is made
a few months, so that the public may chew
the matter over thoroughly. Till 1836 English
"statute law commanded that murderers should be
executed the day following conviction, except
when law-points were reserved for the higher
court. The change was then made to a week, and
afterwards to a fortnight, to give the parsons an
innings or two at the condemned. In China, exe-
cution follows conviction almost immediately, ex-
cept'where torture is expressly decreed, the theory
there being that it is cruel to keep the prisoner
waiting longer than is absolutely necessary.

Mayor Harris seeks to transfer to another
sphere Sydney’s present town-clerk, and put in
his place someone possessed of more business ex-
perience and administrative capacity. Time out of
mind Sydney has never had a town-clerk who, a ■■
town-clerk, was worth much more than his sal t.
Sydney town-clerks have always been more or less
the obedient and humble servants of their vulgar,
absurd, and incompetent masters, the aldermen
—instead of being large, lordly, magnificent,
brainy, diplomatic personages who said “Haw.”
wrote and talked unexceptionable English,
and with a flicker of the eyelash or a curl of the
lip kept the herd of fat and aitchless aldermen in
the places for which God obviously designed them.
A proper town-clerk is a man whose personality
utterly overshadows that of his alleged bosses.
These latter, it would appear, must inevitably be
vulgar persons ; experience teaches that, broadly
speaking, no alderman can ever be a gentleman any
more than any gentleman can ever be an alderman.
To be an alderman is essentially a vulgar ambition.
The fashion may change, but that is a fact.
Sydney town-clerks, in a word, have hitherto
been gentle, harmless creatures —white mice, pink-
eyed rabbits, Italian greyhounds. It is time to
appoint to the position a well-bred, well-trained
powerful brindled bull-dog whom (to mix the
metaphor) the pack of empty, yapping blather-
skites and genial, placid old donkeys that the
ratepayers elect to the Council will instinctively
address as “Sir.” Sydney Corporation doesn’t
want a town-clerk who will be a good servant. It
•jants a town-clerk who will be an unchallenge-
ble Boss, and do his bossing with intelligence.

One Maoriland claimant for
an old-age pension had a difficulty
in proving that his residence in the
province commenced 25 years back,
as required by statute, but he got
over that. He produced a certifi-
cate showing that his eldest son was
born in Maoriland rather more than
25 years ago, and placed the docu-
ment before the court with a proud
thump of satisfaction. The court
looked at it, and scratched its ear.
‘'This document proves that your
wife was in the province 25 years
ago,” it insinuated, gently. “ The
court has noticed that when a birth
takes place the lady is generally—
ahem—present. But how does it
prove that you were in the pro-
vince ? ” Then the applicant opened
his mouth violently to say some-
thing, stopped short with it wide
open, and closed it slowly, while a
new idea spread by gradual instal-
ments over his countenance. Next
he scratched his head, gathered up his
hat and the certificate, and left.

In spite of what some of your correspondents say, I

The decision of Mr. Justice Simpson in a
recent N.S.W. divorce-case wherein he practically
decided that a suspicious night-visit of a female
respondent to a house of questionable character,
was not in itself sufficient evidence of adultery, is
rather at variance with a Vic. decision of not long
ago, where the Judge said that the (male) respond-
ent, who said he had only visited a house of pleasure
to “ shout for the girls,” must be held to have com-
mitted adultery, although there was no positive
evidence of the fact. There rarely was, the
Judge remarked.

The lumpers’ strike at Fremantle has
livened things at that somnolent. port. Moxon,
local manager Adelaide S.S Co., is credited with
having started the trouble, and comes in tor
special execration at the hands of the whai
laborers. Many men were working for less than
255. per week, owing to the scarcity of shipping,
and to reduce the rate was looked upon as most
unjust. Public sympathy is entirely with the
men. Freights and passenger-fares have gone up,
so, according to the philosophy of i lie s.s. owners,
wages must come down. The men may win,
despite the thinly-disguised sympathy of Govt,
with the other side.

The inquest on “ Lord Leamington ” and
his girl at Newcastle reflected great credit on the
watchfulness of Constable Sparks. The officer in
question seems to have been on duty when “ he
saw both the deceased on the balcony of the Gt.
Northern Hotel, a few minutes after noon. Miller
had his arms round the woman’s neck. . . . The
couple retired to their room, and reappeared 2.1
minutes later. . . . The woman drew away from
Miller, who beat his hands together and left the
hotel hurriedly. . . . The woman at this time was
bending over the rail of the balcony twirling a
handkerchief in her hands.” The evidence of
Constable Sparks should warn couples not to be
emotional in a public place. There’s always a
policeman looking out for that sort of thing.

The man best-hated by the Collingwood
(Melb.) tote-push is one Arthur Smythe. Smythe,
who was present when the police raided the
Johnston-street tote-shop, was secured by them as
a witness, and was thereafter approached by tyvo
of the push for the purpose of making it worth
his while to forget a lot when in the box. Smythe
feigned acquiescence, but told the tecs., who
planted themselves in Smythe’s lodgings, so that
when the negotiators came around to fix up the
transaction they were promptly “lumbered.”
The result is that, in order to prevent Smythe’s
immolation, the tecs, have had to put him into safe
hiding. But the push says it can wait.

The engagement appears to have been broken off
at Miss Cligny’s own instance. Hardly anything,
at all events, could be more explicit than, her an-
nouncement, in a letter to defendant, that: “ I

it was merely because she was tearful and hysteri-
cal — that it was, in fact, the kiss-consolatory, not
amatory—and strictly without prejudice. The
Bulletin doesn’t think a jury of women would
have awarded Miss Oligny 500 pence.
ANOTHER FAMILY DISASTER.
ETHEL : “ Aunty, dear, do have another cup of
tea.”
AUNTY: “No, thank you, dear.”
E.: “Ah, do, please, aunty.”
A. (chanyiny her mind): “Very well, dear, I
shall; but why are you so anxious? ”
E.: "Pa says you drink just like a fish!”
The pomps and vanities of the military-
mind seem to come out strong every time the Vic.
Commandant has a holiday. Two or three years
ago it was Col. Templeton, the burly liquidator,
who took sudden possession of Melb. War Office,
on the ground that all his superior officers had left
the province for change of air. The story of how
Templeton banged his brolly on the table, and
started to write despatches and things to the
Defence Dept., was beginning to be forgotten
when Victoria learned, the other day, that some-
thing had happened to Col. Bingham’s amour
propre. After Commandant Holled Smith had
gone on his jaunt to Maoriland, the Minister of
Defence found that Bingham also was off duty,
but without leave from the Dept. Whereupon
the Minister wired Smith to return in a hurry to
explain the absence of Bingham, and Smith ex-
plained that Bingham had got special leave to be
absent all the time Smith was away, in order that
he might be spared the awful indignity of serving
under a less exalted officer.

A while ago the committee dames of
Melb. Women’s Hospital were complaining that
collectors for the rival Queen Victoria Hospital
for Women (where female doctors form the staff)
lri l been “ using the name ” of the older institu-
tion, as though it were a thing to conjure sub-
scriptions with. After last week’s calamitous
mismanagement at the older institution collectors
for the new show, which makes rapid headway in
its temporary premises, will doubtless take good
care to disown any connection with the other
concern.

The steady increase of inmates in the
Parramatta (N.S.W.) Benevolent Asylums is
again causing the authorities grave anxiety.
Should any of the institutions catch fire,
the world will be shocked by an indescribably
hideous holocaust. Successive Colonial Secre-
taries have dodged the question, but the reck-
oning will have to be paid. Stairways, pas-
sages, and floors are all crowded with sleeping,
infirm, and invalid patients, without a hope of
escape from the lofty, inflammable, old buildings.
The fire-appliances are primitive, and the nearest
fire-engine a mile away. <£500,000 canjbe voted
for selectors because they have votes, but the
<£30,000 urgently needed for the helpless and hope-
less poor will never be appropriated.
• * * *
N.S.W. military authorities (in direct con-
travention of the recommendation of the Roya
Commission, which decided that the work could
be done by ordinary drill-instructors) have ap-
pointed one of the staff to the superfluous position
of musketry-inspector, his duties being to surrep-
titiously swoop down and inspect the shooting of
a corps, without advising the commanding-officer
of his visit. Rather suggestive of the aged gentle-
man in the slippers, who shuffles up quietly and
looks over the clerk’s shoulder to see what he is
writing.

Some intemperate
clerics, backed up by
the W. G. T. U M
Christian Endeavor,
&c., met in Hobart,
the other night, to
demand that gamb-
ling, drink, and the
social evil should be
Put Down. One
white - chokered en-
thusiast declared that
a visiting English
clergyman went for
a walk one evening,
in Hobart, not very
late, and in one short
half-hour, in a cer-
tain street, was ac-
costed by no fewer
than 40 ladies of the
pave! The young
man who writes this
knows Hobart well,
and has traversed
the street referred to at
all hours, but has never
met with more than a
tenth of the shepherd’s tally
in the time given. And only one of
the ladies said that she gave discount-coupons —
though that is a side issue. But, of course,' he
isn’t a parson. These things evidently make a
difference.

Reported from the scene of the Hurricane
disaster up north, that the blacks, apparently of
their own accord, turned to and buried the bodies
of the drowned men which had been washed ashore.
This was at Cape Melville. At Weymouth Bay,
further to the north, where Kennedy founded his
death-camp and six men out of eight died of
starvation, the survivors of the Kennedy expedi-
tion were too weak to bury the bodies of those
who died last, and all they could do was to put a
few boughs on them. They were subsequently
buried by a party dispatched by Govt, in the brig
“ Freak,” for the blacks had left the dead alone
although they had incessantly harried the men
when they were alive. This was in ’4B. And
now, in ’99, the descendants of these blacks are
voluntarily burying the bodies of the colored men,
whom they dislike more than ever they did the
whites.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, March 21, 1899.
My Dear Myee—
Even if you don’t believe in it, you must admit
that a family superstition is a really respectable
kind of heirloom. For one thing, it points out
that there is a family, or was, as you can’t have
too much past tense in the matter. We now learn
that our coming Gov. is bringing out, among his
otherpre-histOric bric-Abrac, a Family Curse to
the effect that “noeldest son of an eldest son can
ever succeed to the family honors,” just as he
can’t in the Family Herald. Our Earl’s father
was a second son, but the Earl himself is an
eldest son. “ M.A.P.” describes The-Much-
Talked-Of as sparely-built, and elegant of figure,
looking exceedingly delicate, with a lot of delicate
ancestors behind him. Also, he believes in the
Curse, which is the only way of letting a curse
fulfil its promises.
Another warning to local Snobility is sounded
by the same number of “ M. A. P. ”: “The Austra-
lian . heiress has never taken the place of the
American, but there have been instances where
her opulent dowry has made a desirable addition
to the income of her English husband ! ” This is
nasty for Sydney heiresses intending to annex
Lord Beauchamp; and for girls who are not
heiresses it’s about as comforting as pickled mis-
sionary on the side-board to a converted cannibal.
By the way, everyone knows that the Earl is in-
tellectual. I do hope he will learn that Sydney
has made a rush on Meredith lately, and can’t get
enough copies of “Beauchamp’s Career.” And
here is a thing that so far has not been printed in
Australia. Earl Boauchamp is reputed to be the
biggest holder of English bank-stock, from which
he has an income of £40,000 a year.
“Dear Myee,” writes a Maorilandress from
London, “there is quite a ‘bewtiful’ though
’umble romance about your new Governor, Lord
‘Beecham,’as he is called. Three years ago he
fell passionately in love with a maid who was in
his mother’s service. Despite all opposition he
determined to make her the Countess. With that
end before him he sent her to school on the ‘ con-
tinong.’ No nuptials are expected just yet, and it
behoves every Australian spinster to leave no lock
Uncurled nor any frock unturned to upset such a
mesalliance. Any eligible parti will, I am sure,
receive every assistance from Lady Mary Lygon,
who is to keep house for her brother in the Bota-
nical Garden by the B.H. So wade in, you
feminine cornstalks.”
St. Patrick was the instigator of an Irish
concert at the Town Hall. The concert took
place on the evening of that day which is only
supposed to understand itself in the morning.
A huge shilling crowd struggled for an hour
or so at the doors; indeed, the scene was only
a shade less violent than the first Albani
racket. When you did get inside, a forest of green
rosettes rose up everywhere, even on female heads,
and when people raised their arsenic-colored pro-
grammes a wild green glare spread over the hall.
Through the glare I managed to notice the acting-
Governor’s party in the front row. The Acting-
Governoress was not there, but Miss Darley was
looking tall and fair in a white chiffon bodice, with
white sleeves, and white silk skirt, and, by way of a
little extra vice-regal finish, wore white satin
ball-shoes. His Ex. expanded himself genially
alongside the Cardinal in a scarlet wrapper, and
the only Aide left over from the past was wrapped
all the evening in an interesting “ has-been ” look.
The concert vvas Irish all through. Dr. Mac-
fuire, accompanied by his handsome wife, put his
est brogue into the “ Wearin’ of the Green,” and
ever so many patriots rubbed their eyes. Miss
Josephine O’Reilly, who has not been heard in .
public for a long time, was there in a black elbow- <
sleeved frock, with a green rosette on her shoulder,
to sing a technical ditty about “Savourneen :
Deelish.” Her genuine feeling for the country
fained her an encore later on for “Terence’s
'arewell ” to somebody. Then there was old
“ Kathleen Mavourneen, ” who isn’t so very faded
after all when a fresh voice: like Miss Rooney’s
sings about her. Mrs. Tierney brought out a very
high edition of “ Come Back to Erin ” and shook
off some charming top notes; and, when you closed
your programme, advertisements of four different
kinds of whiskey (it’s Irish to spell it with an “e ”)
gave the happiest Hibernian note of all to the en-
tertainment.
En route for Melbourne, “The Belle of New
York ” girls stayed a day in Sydney. They put
up ■ at the Australia Hotel, and there was much
flutter and bustle going on there on Monday as
the merry insouciant Yankee visitors went in and
out. Some of them are decidedly pretty, but not
in a style we are used to. And some of them—
but they may have been chaperones. I noticed
one pretty freckled “belle” with a very ’Murkan
profile and red-brown hair dressed in an oval [
knob on her collar, go out sight-seeing in a black
frock with a turquoise collar and waist-belt, and
a little shapeless grey felt hat that would have
extinguished the light of a Menus. It was the
sort of detrimental felt that a good young man
in the suburbs wears under the impression
that he is looking like those big men about town
in genuine “slouehers.” ‘ I also noticed a grateful
absence of forced-yellow hair among the co. ;
althoiigh the more artless-looking Titian brown,
vf which there seemed to be a good supply, may
owe j est as much to —well, to reflection. As the
day beauty and the night beauty are such different
beings, I feel sure these girls with their piquant
profiles and dashing figures will make up into
“ daisies.”
The first thing an actress does in entering a
■trange hotel is to rush straight to the photo.-
oases m the lobbies. As the belles went m and
out they all flattened their noses against the cases
of local pros, and commented loudly. They sized
up the merits of pictures at a glance, and went
out. They came in and went for the cases again,
and did more sizing, mostly complimentary.
Groups of local johnnies lounged about admiringly
in the vestibules, but they had no chance what-
ever while those photographs of the women were
there to attract.
Who says that women don’t admire women?
It’s a malicious libel. You can't give the average
woman a greater treat when she comes to see you
than to leave her alone in your sitting-room for
an hour, and let her “ do ” the photographs of
actresses and other pretty women slowly and
alone. She will go round and round, and won’t
know how the time goes. I grant you she some-
times throws out such faint cavilling as “ that’s a
lovely picture, but it isn’t like her,” but, then,
that’s a fault that you find heavily underlined in
men. I never knew a man yet who thought any
woman’s photograph was like her. Women do
admire women—in photographs.
What a pretty stage-woman is Mdlle. Edmunda,
who now turns out to be Mrs. Dante ! I must say
that I would never recognise her in the street, but
on the stage she is a handsome, well-groomed
woman of the Gibson type, with dark, sleek hair
parted in the middle, a cunningly effective make-
up, and a fine cool smile. She looks her best in a
cream suit with short trousers and a tail-coat that
follows the sweep of her figure. And then, as I
said before, seen in the street she is quite a differ-
ent being. Up to the present, it is hardly realised
that a lovely and magnetic woman who can look
like an angel in the glare of daylight may pass
unnoticed on the stage (look at Mrs. Maesmore
Morris, who loses mysteriously but positively
when she makes up and gets behind the foot-
lights) ; and that a woman with some kind
of a profile, a good smile, and a cultured
idea of hair-dressing, may triumph all over
the world as a great stage beauty as long
as she knows how to keep up the semblance.
Of all charms, the strongest, subtlest, most irre-
sistible lies in a voice. Just now there are two
curious voices catering for Sydney’s amusement,
Miss “ Geisha ” Perry’s and Mdlle. Edmunda’s.
Miss Perry’s peculiarity is an aggravated drawl
that always broadens as the play moves on, until
you have her singing about “ Ase-ear ” and
“Gaze-ear.” As for Edmunda, if you want to
hear something truly distressing, go and listen to
her spelling out, in a rasping nasal voice that
doesn’t sound as if it could possibly belong to that
sweet being, “Wan, Art,” which, being inter-
preted is “One, Ought ” —otherwise ten.
The farewell evening given to Mrs. Boesen by
many of her Sydney friends went off pleasantly.
Needs’ rooms are quite the nicest locale in Sydney
for a thing of this kind, as corners, conservatories,
and staircases do everything they can to break up
the awful stiffness of your usual conversazione,
and at this one everyone talked as if it wasn’t a
conversazione at all. Plenty of men and music
filled up all blanks. Mr. Heydon, Q.C., read and
presented an address to Mrs. Boesen, setting
forth the general goodwill of everybody; and
Mrs. Boesen, whose round, good-humored face
has beamed sympathetically over more musi-
cal prodigies and full-blown’stars than any
other face in Sydney, made the usual little
feminine speech, -with a break in the middle,
that conveys so much more than it says.
As far as dressing goes, the assemblage
wore rather an unpremeditated look. The
honored guest was in black, and carried about a
lovely presented posy, with red and white
streamers, out of compliment to the Danish Con-
sulate. Miss Enid Gotthelf wore an exquisite
white frock, with long, clear, sleeves and much
clever embroideries. Madame Kellermann was
remarkably youthful in pale blue, with her hair
hanging down in the frisky French fashion, that
takes 10 years off any woman who has 10,years to
spare. But, “if the frocking was chiefly of the end
of the season variety,: there was so much really
good music that it seemed quite frivolous to be
taking account of things sartorial. Mr. Euras-
iaalker controlled the programme, which went off
as brilliant as. a rocket, and only came ;down like
three clever sticks, in the cases of - Miss Dampier
and Messrs. Stael and Vollmar, whose violin and
’cello solos were all gems. The rest of the‘music
was contributed by Madame Keller man n, Miss
Braund, Mr. Burns-Walker, and dashing Mr.
M'Quade, a pianist who doesn’t often come before
the public. ,
The two other farewell parties of the week were
given to M. and Mme. Blanc, the popular Messa-
geries manager and his wife. M. Biard D’Aunet’s
at home on Wednesday, and ah afternoon on the
Polynesien on Saturday, were both complimentary
goodbyes. Pretty Madame Blanc’s charm is of
that simple irresistible kind that is rarely found
outside a Frenchwoman. Everybody has admired
the harmonious little family circle, including Mrs.
Robertson (Madame Blanc’s mother, a charming
old lady who married a Scotchman), Miss Robert-
son, the Blancs themselves, and their three graceful
Frenchy children.. . 1 The whole .• family left. on
Monday by the Polynesien for Marseilles, where
M. Blanc will take the sub-management of the
head-office of the M; M co. ;
The youngest daughter of the late , Hon. Billy
“ Commotion ” Pearson recently tripped to Hobart
and captured a nice-looking youth for a husband
in the person of one of the supernumeraries em-
ployed at “ Tattersall’s ” consultation-factory.
The lady is said, in sporting parlance, to “ sit
behind ” close on <£loo,ooo, and, despite objections
raised by relatives, took the youth for better or
worse at St. Andrew’s Church, Hobart, on March
7. The lucky man’s name is Percy Miller, son of
“Handsome Charley Miller,” an old-time Hobart
identity who subsequently settled near Geelong
(Vic.) and who boasts a strain of the ancient Dun-
leath blood of ould Ireland.
The marriage of a well-known belle to a stipen-
diary magistrate is to be followed a week later by
the union of her father to a lady with a Hebrew
appellation. The engagement is said to have
been pending for some time. Other weddings
shortly-to take place are those of Miss Rose
Masters and Mr. Armitage, and Miss Thompson
and Mr. Eady. The engagement of Miss Hague-
Smith has _ been lately announced. As several
other weddings are also about to come off, and
this is the Lenten season, it can only be con-
jectured that Sydney youths feel anxious to secure
their brides before the advent of a fascinating
bachelor Earl.
A mistake somehow crept into the papers re the
wedding of Miss Beatrice Airey, which wa.s sup-
posed to be fixed for 15th March at St. John’s,
Darlinghurst. At an early hour the usual rush to
a fashionable wedding set in, and all the regula-
tions which have been adopted at St. John’s since
the wedding of Miss Nellie Hill, as to pew-holders
only being admitted and so forth, were strictly
enforced on this occasion. But audible comments
were passed freely in the gallery as the guests
began to arrive, such as “A pique skirt for a
wedding ! ” “A blouse and sailor hat! ” “ More
sailor hats ! What a wedding ! ” At last the truth,
dawned upon the assemblage. This wedding was
only a tame little affair got up from Womerah
Avenue, and the sightseers had been just a week
too previous in regard to Miss Airey.
Sydney medical students are “velly solly for
we.” Since the Adelaide Hospital warfare the
Adelaide students have had to abandon their
course at the end of their third year, and finish up
at Melbourne, Sydney, or Edinburgh. One of the
first of these batches has just passed his fifth year
in Sydney, and carried off the highest honors at
graduation (Dr. Blackburn); and the present
fourth-year class has been informed that four
Adelaide men have swooped down upon it. What
with brilliant female students and the enterprising
Adelaideans, the fourth-year medicoes feel any-
thing but happy just now.
During the recent examinations at Sydney Uni-
versity consternation was caused amongst candi-
dates at the Logic and Philosophy examination to
find posted on the door of the exam.-room the
notice, “ Papers have not arrived.” The exam.,
of course, had to be deferred, and’one fair student
has to give up a trip to Queensland on that
account. Of course the printers are blamed, but
everyone says a recent honeymoon had something
to do with it.
Some of the Radical papers in the South of
England describe new Governor Tennyson as a
bad-tempered, easily-offended, and very conceited
person. He has quarrelled with the Parish Coun-
cil in the district where he resides in the Isle of
Wight, and refused to sit upon it any longer, be-
cause he couldn’t have things all his own way.
Also, agrarian outrages have been committed on
his estate—apparently by rustics who wished in
this way to emphasise their opiiiion of the land-
lord. London Truth describes the new S.A.
Governor’s qualifications for i the billet as 000, and
prognosticates storms and wreckage. Certainly
Tennyson’s ultra-imperialism was not likely to
commend the new man to “Labby.”
It is told of the elder of Tennyson’s youngsters
that, ‘when informed that his father was going to
“represent the Queen in South Australia,” he
remarked, “ Then I suppose I shall represent the
Prince of _ Wales.” Tennyson, by the way, is
strengthening the crimson bonds by sending out
to Adelaide in advance the late , Laureate’s car-
riage, which he announces that he intends to use
on “State” occasions. Everything points to
more fuss-and-feathers at S.A. Govt.-House than
for very many a day past; and the relations of
Premier Kingston with the new man are looked
forward to with much curiosity.
On the other hand, “Lady Tennyson,” writes a
friend from London, “will suit the City of Churches
up to the spires. She is a sweet-faced, soulful-
looking woman who wears her hair o’er her classic
brows like our mothers wore it (their own) o’er
their classic brows. Neither ‘ my lord ’ nor ‘ my
lady’is likely to more than placidly ripple the
Capital of the Wheatfields.”
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ Governor Brassey is a dreadfully funny-look-
ing old man on a hot day. He has got a white
duck suit and a big.helmet, low in the eaves and
high in the peak. What you see under it is like a
piece of carved beetroot. The garb and manner
are such as the late A. A. Sleight, the mammoth
undertaker, would have surely copied, as suitable
to his business in hot weather.
“Everybody raves over Amy Castles and her
wonderful voice. It is a wonderful voice, and no
mistake. Rich, pure, organ-like tones poured
forth without .the slightest effort. ‘A dramatic
soprano, ’ say authorities,' The lucky possessor is
a Bendigo 17-year-old. She , doesn’t look more
than 15—just an uriaiffeeted school-girl with dark
hair hanging over her shoulders, and black-lashed
grey eyes. The Austral Salon, and all other
societies and individuals who have heard-the-little
stranger sing, tumble over one another in their
eagerness to claim her as a protegee.
“ Other girlish warblers, encouraged by kindly
Salomtes just now, are Bertha Bird and Nellie
Archer. The former, a slight, fragile warbler,
didn’t get too much jam from local musical critics
for her concert achievements (11th March). In
consequence, she looked rather harried and heotic
this week, and the Amy Castles craze is probably
another thorn in the elder girl’s spirit. Nellie
Archer is to have a benefit shortly. She too has
a nice voice ; but, like Miss Bird, suffers vocally
in this scribe’s estimation through having been
heard on the same day as the Bendigo prodigy
aforesaid.
“ The Oruba ‘rolling home to Merrie England'
with fashion, music, song, and story aboard should
make a lively run, when once passengers find their
sea-legs. Mellow-voiced Maggie Sterling has in
charge the 17-year-old girl-winner of the Clarke
piano-scholarship, and the second-cabin won’t be
christened the ‘Vale of Tears ’ this trip if midship-
mite Tommy Titheradge can help it. Local
theatrical tipsters predict for Lily T. whatever
roses and raptures fall to the share of successful
ingenues in the Big Smoke. Anyway, old friends
cherish her memory as a winsome operatic lad,
despite that girly trick of grabbing every two
seconds at her boyish stage back-hair.
‘‘ In the second Brough production, Winnie
Austin, as a French drummer-boy, was so stolid
and chunky as to suggest a small Dutch y, rather
than a Parisian powder-monkey. A juvenile
M’sieu is generally less phlegmatic than his own
bulk in quicksilver. Present scribe knows a girl
who, in early life, once refused the last bit of
elastic in her boot-sides to le petit Louis, a little
foreigner addicted to the manufacture of lillipu-
tian ‘cats’ fiddles.’ The baffled genius promptly
hanged himself to the bath-shower by a towel,
was cut down, and between gasps accused his
paralysed playmate of ‘ teazing ! ’ Hustled to bed
m disgrace, the latter was lulled to sleep that
night by bowdlerised accounts of Delilah,. Jezebel,
and other bad biblical girls who grew up to drive
‘ good men ’ to desperation.
“In the ‘Brixton Burglary’ Grace Noble’s
appearance as a grown-up married baby provides
a splendid object-lesson on the importance of being
well-dressed. As a picnic-belle in ‘ One Summer’s
Day ’ she was a tall, graceful ‘ somebody, ’ simply
though smartly clad in well-cut white blouse and
skirt, the latter’s long, unbroken lines adding in-
credibly to the wearer’s apparent inches. As Mrs.
Pontifex, of the present production, Miss Noble is
just a prettyish, suburban nonentity in a cut-up,
trimmed, blended, green and blue frock, and
medley toque in blues, greens, magenta and
clusters of pinkish purply phlox.
The green cloth skirt trails fashionably and has
an inner pale-blue frill. The cut-away coatee
reveals the full vest of the coming winter, worn
over a blouse, but the tout ensemble is somehow
stale, flat and unprofitable. Neither are there chic,
compensating details—such as rapturous gloves—to
set women spectators tossing enviously through
wakeful watches of subsequent nights.
“ As for that serviceable red stuff, braided with
black, which clothes the sweet young sister-in-law
(Evelyn Marthege)! Well, a woman standing her
trial for heresy or worse, by a jury of severe
matrons, would be wise to appear at the bar in a
fac simile of that warm, comfortable, utilitariar
garment. Result—discharged without a stain
upon her character.
“Mother-in-law Bessie Thompson’s pale grey is
braided, too. Come to think of it, thejdre all
braided ! This lively matron, in white chiffon
blouse, blonde hair, and pink roses in her belt,
thanks to the juxtaposition of such down-tailed
daughters, shines out like a person with a past
taking a class in Sunday-school. Said Mrs. Frazer
Green is a splendid one to laugh. By the way, a
school for laughing has been started for the benefit
of pork-heiresses and sich in New York. First
lesson explains the mechanism of the ‘ sarcastic
laugh, ’ which may not be the simplest brand of
giggle for all that. First culinary lecture,
disciples generally tackle omelets, but, though
many have passed through a cookery course, few
are successful omeleteers. The ‘low, mellow, con-
tralto laugh ’ is described as the mos*- difficult of
attainment.
“ Talking of single eye-glasses and similar
dangling fal-lals of the moment, ’tis said that such-
like are less prevalent at ’Ome than with us. One
of Lady Carington’s daughters lately appeared at
some evening function m pale blue silk muslin
without the ghost of a trinket on view.

Chief Justice—then Mr.—James
Martin was the originator of the quip about
George Thornton, M.L.C., having met
Captain Cook. Martin was speaking in the
House on some question involving a matter
°f bygone N.S.W. history when Thornton
made an interjection. “I stand corrected,”
said Martin, “ the honorable member ought
to know, if any man does, for I have it on
good authority that he was sitting on a
rock out Botany way waiting to give Cook
aweleome on his first landing.”
“ Saw Rhodes 1., the Chartered

is about five feet ten, broad and full, hint-
ingly aldermanie, heavy face wrinkled like
a railway map of England, and well-ad-
vanced towards greyness. Thick hair
pushed off and away from strong forehead,
brusque ‘ nigger - bossing ’ manner, the
‘caged-lion ’ walk, ever-restless hands, and
plainly dressed in a black sac-suit. When
excited, his voice broke into a boyish
treble that suggested stretched nerves and
that a discussion on the ‘Little Eng-
lander’ was not good for the Jingo King.
He relieved his feel ings by kicking the
grate of blazing coals viciously and with
much confidence in his bootmaker. The
‘wiping-up’ of Mr. Kruger or his suc-
cessor and the best kind of crumb-brush

purpose of his cogitations with Chamber-
lain. C.R. is a man you would pass in
the street—as opposed to Sirdar Kitchener,
whom you couldn’t in a paddock—buta few
minutes in a room and the overpowering
force, or self-belief, of the African ex-
ploiter demands tribute to an extraordin-
ary personality.”
Tyson, like other people, was not
uniformly successful. Over 20 years ago he
made a good spec, in Q. sugar. He bought
the whole produce of one plantation cheap
for cash and shipped the lot to Adelaide,
whence he ran it up the Murray and’
Darling to his stations on the Q. border at
Tibooburra—selling much of it on the way
at such high figures that what was left
when the sugar reached his stations was
enough for two or three years’ require-
ments free of cost to him. His next sugar
venture did not end so well. He advanced
a big sum on another Q. plantation. Rust
and frost killed the cane, and Tyson had to
foreclose, and sent a nephew to take charge.
The nephew, knowing nothing about the
business, went fooling with the machinery,
had a bad smash, and wrote to his uncle
to know what he should do ? The old man
replied that his nephew surely could not
have forgotten that for many years he had
been liberally supplied by him with pocket-
money; and, as he had no doubt saved
largely, he might depend upon it that if
he devoted some of his wealth to repairing
the injury he had done, he would never
hear one word of complaint from his affec-
tionate uncle James. The nephew paid the
bill (£114) Tyson about the same time
went in largely and unsuccessfully for
sugar selections on the Johnstone.

affecting the solvency of certain banks and busi-

pretty constantly of late, and the Govt, organ
took on itself the responsibilitv of publishing dis-
claimers on the part of one of the banks, and a

however, apparently thought the apology was
worse than the disease, and promptly fired in a

to do with his action against a paper that has
always displayed a slavish attachment to the For-

THE DEPARTURE OF THE XI.
“Dan” Martin, Central Queensland
pioneer, recently died at Rockhampton whither he
went shortly after its foundation and engaged in
carrying to Copperfield (Clermont) in the days ,of
niggers and no railways. Made his “pile,” and
not being “ in the know,” invested all and more
in Mt. Morgan shares when they were in their
“teens.” Lost everything. Never got over it,
and died broken in health and fortune.
Dr. Broughton Kyngdon, who died, the
other day, at Bowral at the ripe age of 80, was a
father of Australian homoeopathy. For years he
practised at Darlinghurst, Sydney, inducing many
of the exclusive people of that quarter to trust to
similia similibus. He took his medical qualifica-
tions in England in 1842. But it was as a social
improver his character was strongest. In this
sphere he encountered no allopathic opposition.
Catherine H. Spence, the brainy little
woman who pushes her effective-voting scheme at
every opportunity, haR popped up again in view
of 8. A. elections. Is 74 years of age, but with all
the energy and enthusiasm of a Gladstone or a
red-ant. For 20 years Miss Spence has been
writing S.A. Register leaders.
The two Drs. Bollen, who have pulled
“General ” Booth through his illness in S.A., are
comparative youngsters, and are among the few
Australians who were sent to ’Murkan medical
schools in preference to English. Bollen, sen.—he
died a few years back —divided a generation be-
tween local preaching and homoeopathic dosing.
When the man who hasn’t smoked or
drunk grog dies at 90, his old age is promptly
ascribed to his abstemiousness. The other day a
South Australian, Adam M'Arthur, died at 86.
When a young man of 60 or so, he fell down a
shaft 83ft. ; also, his wives had 14 children. But
down to date, nobody seems to have added these
to the recipes for reaching within seeing-distance
of the century.
R. Barr-Smith, S.A.’s free-handed mil-
lionaire, has packed up for England, perhaps
never to return. He married the sister of Thomas
Elder, his deceased partner, and it is believed
that his wife is almost as wealthy as he is. B.S.
has scattered his money almost as prodigally as
Angas in benevolent objects. In Torrens Park he
owns, perhaps, the finest suburban residence in
any Australian city.
Attorney General Want was extremely ill
just before he left Sydney. His medical attendant
strongly warned him against appearing in the
lengthy Atacama case, during which he once had
very ugly symptoms indeed. As two of “Jack’s ”
brothers have died more or less unexpectedly
during the last few years, it is no wonder he
stretches every point to obtain rest.
Davis, M.L.A., who ousted Miller for
Bourke, is a noted and popular character in his
district, where he is familiarly and to his face
known to everyone as “Baldy.” One night he
stopped at a station for tea, and the mistress
called a black-gin cook and gave instructions for
the entertainment of the “gentleman.” Mary
pricked up her ears. “Genelman, where him?”
pointing incredulously to the visitor. “No fear
baal him genelman—him on’y Baldy Davis ! ” ’
John White, the oldest leader of the Melb.
unem pl °yed, and a Yarra-banlc agitator, will be
(J ea , rfl . o,d m May next. An ex-Londoner, he
ooks back to a state of things of which most men
nave only second-hand information, and dates his
scorn tor the Oppressor back to the time of the
Ohartist riots.

to England, of Victoria, is dead, aged
i•), ana his remains are going ’Ome to be buried in
a tomb he bought there years ago. The old man
tought more law-suits than the average 1000 men,
>ut Ins forte was attending meetings of share-
holders of mining and other companies in which
he was interested. When he turned up things
were always made red-hot by reason of the knotty
questions he would put to the chairman, after
which he would metaphorically scalp the directors.
1 his line of conduct, though it allowed him to
attain a green oid age, probably sent many others
to early graves.
Dead Julius Vogel was a man of many
schemes always had some fresh idea for turning
the world on end. But it is the man who sticks
undeviatingly to one thing at a time who sees his
projects through. Before "Vogel finally left
Maoriland he sought the assistance of his acquaint-
ances in bringing out a sort of M.L. Picturesque
Atlas in London, but the work was never issued.
As a rule, his political ventures also missed fire or
stopped half-way, with the result that Maori-
landers remember him with scorn and bitterness,
and Robert Stout probably execrates the day that
he fell in with hoomster Vogel.
Jack Kidman, eldest of the Kidman
brothers, whose names are becoming almost as
well-known among stockmen as Tyson’s, died the
other day at Broken Hill, which he had made his
conveniently - central quarters. The Kidmans,
who had been among stock all their lives, found
their opening at Broken Hill, just as Tyson found
his at Bendigo; afterwards they began the live-
stock trade with the West, and have retained
almost a monopoly of it. They followed the old
man’s lead, too, in steadily adding to their land-
holdings ; Tickalara station, on ’ the N.S.W.-
Queensland border, was their last purchase. Jack,
the keenest buyer of the brotherhood, went under
at almost his first attack of illness, while still in
middle age.
“0.J.”: Dead, Pat Carroll, who con-
veyed wounded Peter Lalor from Ballarat to Gee-
long after the Stockade fight. Herewith Carroll’s
own account of the occurrence. He was returning
from Ballarat, with an empty waggon, when a
priest sounded him as to whether he would under-
take to carry the wounded man to Geelong. .£5OO
had been offered for Lalor’s body, dead or alive,
and this was impressed upon Carroll. “ Bloodr
money ! ” said he, with disgust. “ Where is he ? ”
A.nd with a Cornishman named Marks to help
him, Carroll made Lalor as comfortable as he
could, under a tarpaulin, and jogged out of Bal-
larat. Mounted police were scouring the country,
and Carroll was bailed up at Buninyong, Mere-
dith and all along the road, and rigidly examined.
But nobody thought of lifting the tarpaulin, ap-
parently thrown carelessly on the floor of the
waggon. One did poke at it with his sword —an
anxious moment ! But Marks sat with his legs
thrown across Lalor’s body, placidly smoking his
pipe. “’Twas thanks to God I gave,” said Car-
roll, “ when I rolled into town with the poor man,
safe through the trouble.”
Apropos Dubberke’s proposal to stay at
Melb. gaol until the sensation should have blown
over, there would have been no difficulty about
such a course. Sullivan, one of the Maungatapu
(M.L.) murderers, in the 60’s lived at Wedder-
burn (Vic.), and, several gold-dealers being missed,
Sullivan was suspected and fled to M.L. Here he
joined Burgess, Levy, and Kelly, and they had
murdered several men before they were caught..
Sullivan, who was ringleader, turned informer,
and his mates were hanged. He returned to
Wedderburn and lived in a mia-mia near the house
of his wife, but people naturally shunned him, and
some pals of the three who were hanged (also Vic-
torians) were going to “deal it out” to Mr, Sul-
livan. He appealed to the police and, for protec-
tion, was promptly “ vagged ” and kept in Melb.
gaol for three months, during all which time his
enemies hung about in the hopes of meeting him
when he was discharged. He was quietly fired
out of gaol, nobody but those immediately con-
cerned knowing where he was sent. Years later
he was railway sub-contracting in N.S.W. when,
he sickened and died in hospital.


Among the varied phenomena of Australia, the
“ Zetz” natural mineral spring at Bullimore, near Dubbo,
N.S.W., takes no unimportant a place. Right from the
heart of Nature’s laboratory this spring pours out daily
an illimitable supply of sparkling mineral water, now
sold everywhere as Zetz-Spa water. The enormous in-
crease in the demand testifies in a striking manner to the
popularity and good effects of Zetz-Spa water, which is
rightly called “ The Premier Natural Mineral Table
Water.” The best imported waters cannot equal it.*
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*

“ Bellourne ” : Interesting to note how
familiar birds, and even lizards, will become, “ if
encouraged,” in parts of the W.A. goldfields
where there is no surface-water for hundreds of
miles. Around this camp there are many bell-
birds, parrots, and crows, which come every day
looking for something to eat or drink. The most
notable are two old crows (naturally very sus-
picious birds). I often leave a pannikin of water
just outside the tent, where I can reach it from
my bunk with the side of the tent strapped up,
and these two crows will come at peep of day,
watch till I am perfectly still, and then hop down
and drink. The lizards, commonly called “ fly-
catchers,” will come with very little encourage-
ment, and catch flies on my boots. Visited a
neighboring camp one Sunday afternoon, and
found occupant asleep with one of these lizards
(about Bin. long) perched on his chest keeping a
bright look-out, and, when a fly settled on the
man’s face, the lizard would have it. My friend
informed me that after one afternoon spent in this
way, the lizard would sleep till following Sunday,
and then resume operations.

“ Trebless ” : Humors of aN.S.W. Dis-
trict Registrar’s office. Man registering birth of
THAT TIRED FEELING.
7th child, gave all particulars up to year and
place of marriage, but not being able to give pre-
cise date, was allowed to sign the register and
depart with promise to supply the needed figures.
As he hadn’t shown up in a week, he was
written to, whereupon his “wife ” called and said
her “ husband ” must have forgotten they had
never been legally married, although they had
lived together for 16 years. Of course all entries
had to be cancelled and children registered afresh
by the mother as illegitimate. Tried hard to get
the pair to consent to a marriage, but though the
man was willing the woman, strange to say, re-
fused. Said he’d “ never raised his hand to her
since they took up together, and she was afraid if
she was tied to him he might start playing up.
Then she would have to stand it! ”
Another man—stranger in district —on regis-
tering death of child, enquired as to an under-
taker. Gave him address of one. Week later
received letter from undertaker expressing his
gratitude for my putting custom in his way, and
winding up with —“ If ever I can do anything in
my line for you, or yours, I will make it as cheap
as possible ! ”
Again, married a couple one night at 8 o’clock,
and two days afterwards husband registered birth
of child, born on the wedding-night!

“J.F.D.”: “Out back met a trooper
and a black-tracker. Trooper was sitting on his
horse waiting for Jacky, who lagged behind, to
come up and open gate. Lazy Jacky didn’t feel
disposed to get down, so trooper rushed him and
dragged him off, and then prepared to ride over
him. Jacky bolted for fence, and from a safe
point let himself out: —“ That’s enough, missa
plurry trooper. Me tellem your wife one plurry

A police-sergeant at a W.A. coastal town
was noted for his luck. Used to put away a noble
amount of grog without turning a hair, and when
the boys were “ pretty well on ” the sergeant
would suggest a marble; yet never would he be
“ stuck.” But one morning he was found dead in
bed with his uniform on, and when he was turned
over, out of his pocket dropped a marble. It was

At Ana-Branch, near Charters Towers (Q.),
Mollie Brennan, a little 10-year-old girl, got
bushed on a recent Monday, and, though the
country was scoured in every direction, was not
found till the following Friday. The oppressive
heat, and the many outrages committed of late
years on females in Mongrelia by kanakas, In-
dians, &c., made it a welcome surprise to discover
the child, 22 miles from home, in a wonderfully
vigorous state after being five days foodless. The
girl’s pet pony stuck to his small mistress well.
He used to feed close around her all night, and
voluntarily come to her to be mounted in the
mornings. Tying the pony up never entered the
child’s head.

A Jaypee candidate at a recent N.Q.

The prickly-pear—hitherto considered a
pest —is turning out a blessing in disguise. It
makes an excellent ensilage element, and has such
an extraordinary effect in enabling cattle to with-
stand the effects of drought as to make its culti-
vation in such circumstances of more value than
its extermination. A Sydney D.T. correspondent
instances the case of two cows which for four
months were kept in good condition, without water,

A crank with a snake-bite antidote struck
Launceston (Tas.) the other day, and was far
more cocksure over his alleged discovery than
“King Billy of the Mooki ” ever knew how to
be. Two snakes, fresh from the bush, were sooled
on to two cats. The first cat bitten died, without
the antidote, in 55min. ; the second one, treated
with the antidote, was a dead cat in exactly an
hour. Enraged at his failure, the antidote person
wanted to let the snakes bite him, but the assem-
bled doctors declined to stay and officially chroni-
cle the result.

“ N.N.” on a pastoral subject:—
A satire on the efficacy of the rabbit-proof netting on
Harden-Blayney railway-fence (which netting was put up
by Govt.) is the fact that a colony of rabbits has made its
home in the ends of the railway embankments where
they abut on the bridge over Thornhill-street, Young.
The netting is affixed to the fence on the west side of the
line, and therefore, if it were of any use, no rabbits
would exist either in the railway enclosure or on the
eastern side of the line ; but they may be seen any morn-
ing or evening, at the place indicated, running across the
street from one embankment to the other.

“Caledonia,” on a more or less literary
subject:—
Henry Lawson’s recent “ Red Page” wail recalls an expe-
rience of my own. Travelling in the bush for nothing in
particular, I found myself at bedrock in a one-pub. Cen-
tral Q. town. Having a weakness for spinning sentences,
I interviewed the local editor, with an offer to write him
a leading article for the price of a drink. The hairless
man of letters was up to his eyebrows in compilation—his
organ came out once a week, and was filled mostly with
extract matter and dummy advts.—but my offer struck
him as attractive, and, after some talk, he agreed that I
was to “ dash off ” 20 or 30 political leaders, and he—
“ having no authority from the proprietor to pay con-
tributors”—would, in return, hand me over his week’s
screw. On the strength of this apparently satisfactory
arrangement, I made merry in X until pay-day. On
the fatal Monday morning the editor was out early hunt-
ing up the cashier, and the cashier was out earlier hunt-
ing up subscribers. I was hanging round, waiting for
something to turn up. But the editor kept his word
honorably. I got his week’s screw—exactly 2s. Bd.

“H.M.1.”: In reply to “Wal” and
others, didn’t mean it at all to be inferred that
the paper-bark tree was indigenous to W.A. The
nature of the country would undoubtedly govern
the character of the flora subject to climatic in-
fluence. But can “ Wal ” suggest a use to which
the paper-bark can be put? The days of the
palimpsest have passed away, and paper is as
cheap as—well, string. Ergo, a suggestion to the
point might induce an industry.
- Almost every report of N.S.W. Aborigines
Protection Board pipes pseans of satisfaction over
the work done. Invariably, however, the facts
recorded prove loose morality on mission
stations and other subsidised centres. Ad-
ditional evidence in this direction conies
from the recent criminal court sittings
held at Narandera. During the hear-
ing of an assault case there, Judge
Rogers and counsel are reported to have
made “remarks that were anything but
complimentary regarding the morality of
the Warangesda mission station ” —the
scene of the alleged assault. “ Coun-
sel,” the report goes on, “described
the station as the breeding-ground
of illegitimate children, who were
bred and fed at the expense of the
Govt.” Yet the Aborigines Pro-
tection Board announces annually
that all goes well.
“ H.M.1.” : The daintiest thing
in Westralian game is the ordinary
grey ’possum between the months of
Nov. and March. During this period
he feeds on the young leaves of the
“jam” tree, and is mud-fat, the skin
consequently being utterly valueless.
Cooked in native fashion, he is then as
sweet as the proverbial nut, and more so,
the tongue and brains being especial de-
licacies. A connoisseur couldn’t tell him
from a capon roasted in a Christian oven.
Strange to say, writer was introduced to

“J.F.D.”: Lately met, out-back, a

fool of every tramp who tried to work along-
side her.
A Gippsland resident, felling a tree near
his house the other day, came upon a relic of quite
an ancient courtship—a letter dated 34 years ago,
almost dust, and barely decipherable, but giving
information enough to show that it had been
deposited by an amorous damsel in a small hollow
in the tree for a bucolic lover who never called at
the post. The name of the writer is legible The
letter lay in a sapless niche quite overgrown with
bark and new layers of wood, and the nice young
man to whom it is addressed may have it by
affording proof of his identity.

“Monk Housen ” : Caught “Nomad”
tripping. Although born in Bendigo, and brought
up on the Shelly Beach at Warrnambool, I’ve also
travelled much in Arabia, and want to say there
are no “bul-buls,” famous or otherwise, there.
Spent a week once at Jeddah with George Robin-
son, an Eton boy, then British Vice-Consul and
agent for the Ottoman Regie. If “Nomad’s”
friend travelled a mile outside Jeddah (the only
place the foreigner penetrates in Arabia) I bet he
has one of three things—(l) A scar on his throat,
(2) a bullet-wound in his back, or (3) a fine taste
for lying. One can always see bull bulls, some
black, some white, in the abattoirs at Footscray,
that other Araby the blest, but never oh ! never
in Arabia. “Nomad's” friend’s Arabian shep-
herd’s companion must have been a magpie—or a
myth.
M'Cooey on the bul-bul
-Rathe “shepherd’s companion.” If “Nomad” (8.,
4/3/’99) refers to the Australian sauloprocta, his “friend”
is absolutely at sea in thinking it identical with the
Arabian “ bul-bul.” Sauloprocta sp. is essentially Aus-
tralian, and in no way, not even generically, remotely re-
sembles the bul-bul. We have, however, an admixture of
bird fauna of other countries with our ornithology. Years
ago, our own Dr. Ramsay astonished the ornithological
world by proving that one of our quails was identical
with Gmelin’s European quail ; and Darwin makes great
and interestingly illustrative use of this discovery in his
“ Origin of Species.” Several other instances, equally un-
expected and interesting, of the admixture of the bird
fauna of this and other countries have been pointed out
by Dr. E. P. Ramsay.

“ J.P.M.” on certain aspects of the kan-
garoo :
“ S.R.” (8., 18/2/’99) must have studied ’roos’ habits at
the Museum. Have seen a pet kangaroo of my own jump
into the Goulburn when a banker and" swim about
amongst the dogs for the pure fun of the thing. Have
seen old and young-men ’roos swim the same river in full
flood, and go almost straight across, despite the current,
and the Goulburn in flood is no slouch. Also have seen a
powerful kangaroo-dog drowned by an “ old man ” in the
middle of same river where 40 or 50ft. deep, said dog
having himself previously drowned many a kangaroo.
The pet ’roo aforementioned would start with the dogs
after any wild ’roos who came near the house paddock,
and, strange to say, any lagging dog would pass her in
the hunt and follow up the wild ones. If the chase was
short, she would be a deeply-interested spectator at the
kill. All her sympathies seemed to be with her mates—
the dogs. Regarding ’roos’ family affairs, I have never
seen more than one joey at a time with mother, and. I
have seen hundreds of them in Moree (N.S.W.) dis-
trict. Seen lots of females killed with joey at foot; never
found a twin in or out of pouch. Refer to red or grey
species ; know nothing of w'allabies.

N.S.W. District Court Judge Murray,
who goes to England for a holiday, has done much
good work in judicial capacities. Apart from
bench business, he has discharged numerous im-
portant public duties. He helped to divide
N.S.W. into the electorates which now return 125
members. He was also a local-government com-
missioner. He has conducted about a score of
royal commissions, covering matters of diverse
character. His chief University distinction was
in mathematics, and the habit of close thinking
and logical reasoning implied in that study
appears to stick to him in his public duties. Mis
impartiality is admitted on all sides, Protectionist
and Freetrade Premiers showing equal confidence
in his judgment. On several occasions Judge
Murray was named for a seat on the Supreme
Court bench, but custom and prejudice have, so
far, stood in his way. When such a vacancy
occurs political influence is also a factor in deter-
mining the new appointment.

A Yankee journalist, who lately visited Aus-

cricket than they do of God.” In which connection a
well-known man avers that he came into Sydney, from a
distance, on the afternoon of Friday week, on an affair of
much importance t o himself and a client. He went to
the Copy right-office at 2.15-the office is not supposed to
close till 4-and found the place hermetically sealed, each
individual official having gone to the cricket-match, lie
was thus prevented from proceeding by that evenings
express to Melbourne. He is unreasonable enough to feel
aggrieved at this.

THE GIRL OF HIS HEART: “ What yer think? I

Often wondered how a Sydney wood-
carter gained by selling “ this cart of best box-wood,
lidy, for half-a-crown.” But it’s all very simple. Drives
up to front of house and trades the load to old lady, who
tells him to drive round to the back. On the way there
Clontarf Bill tips out most of the “best box” in some
quiet place, and dumps the rest—mostly stringy-bark or
gum—into yard. Then returns and re-loads boxwood.
Old lady none the wiser till “ father ” comes home. Also,
Cion-Bill finds about 8 p.m. best time for selling. His
pathos when lying about how he’s been out all day without
turning a “bob” is weakening, and when he says his
Robbo is feedless and breaking down with heavy load
Horsestralia’s sympathetic heart buys wood—generally
worthless. But a good turn has been done for a horse.

A N.S.W. agricultural expert recently visited

and fruit-trees, were recently put up to auction for unpaid
water-rates, and knocked down for £l. “Go on the

“Steve”: Re the small trader’s bag-tricks
(8., 11/2’99), the whole question of retailers’ weights and
measures demands legislative attention. The supposed
lb of candles is oftener than not only 12 or 14oz. Bars of
soap are 28’S, 30’s, 36’s, 40’s (number of bars to the cwt.),
and the apparent difference between the bars is so slight
and unnoticeable without weighing that the “ ringing-in ”
of 32’s for 28’s is very easy. The “ 21b.” tin of jam also is
mostly but 28 or 30oz. gross. Packet teas may be nett or
gross. If nett, it is mentioned on the packet; if gross, it
is not, and the grossness may amount to 2 or 3oz. of lead-
foil, mill-board, or paper. Same with tinned peppers,
coffees, and, in fact, all packet goods ; canister, bag, and
packet-manufacturers make as many different sizes as
they are asked for. But the bag of flour is the champion
swindle. In a score of shops one may notice, apparently,
the same-sized bag ranging from, say, 6£d., in halfpennies,
up to B^d., but they are also 24’s, 26’s and 28’s, and so on
to the cwt., the difference in some cases amounting to
only a couple of ounces. Again, a butter-manipu-
lator can work in an ounce or two of water to the
pound. The inspector of weights and measures may
prosecute for false scales or weights, and for short
weight in bread or coals—but go into a grocer’s and ask
for 101 b. flour, and if you get but 91b. the grocer has only
to say it was a mistake. Wholesale merchants connive
at this systematic short-weight giving. The travellers
will offer to pack a ton of flour, or soap, or any other
article in any sized packet you like, and are even ready
to put your particular name or brand on in addition.
Some low-down tea-merchants also open chests of tea, re-
pack them, soldering the lead inner-wrapper, put on the
mat, and re-label. Yet none of these practices are within
the “Weights and Measures” or Adulteration, Act.
Traders should be compelled to label packages not only
with exact quality and kind of contents, but also with
nett weight. If 16oz. must be in the lb. of bread, why
shouldn’t it be so with every other commodity ? Man
does not live by bread alone.

“O.P.”:Know of a Sydney watchmaker who
has on hand a score or so of watches left for repairs, and
never claimed. Each one represents to him an equitable
asset (the repairing charge), but he is legally debarred
from ever recovering it, and compelled to go on wiping
the cobwebs off them with disinterested affection till his
hair goes grey. Same with boot-repairers and all others
in position of bailee and part-proprietor —vastly different
from that of banker, trustee, or Chancery boss, who is a
bailee only, and has no vested interest to lose by being
compelled to hang on to the “lost heir’s” cash. Of
course, every tradesman has his risks to run, but it’s a
fool of a law that makes him do himself out of his own
lawful earnings, and go on incessantly tempting himself
to get run in for appropriating goods partly his own,
though nominally belonging to nobody else.

The methylated spirit-refining industry booms
in Sydney. Meth. spirit is spirits-of-wine made nasty and
undrinkable with a blend of naphtha and pyridine, which,
when fined out again, leave that “white spirit” which
the ingenuity of commerce fixes up to masquerade as
almost anything else in the liquor line. Last year, the
Col. Sugar Co. and Elliott Bros, manufactured 52,000ga1.
meth. spirit for legitimate sale purposes. Much also is
made by other local firms, and much imported ; and, as
it is absurd to think of at least 100,000 gal. as used up for
varnishes, &c., in N.S.W., a vast quantity of the stuff gets
into the cheap pubs. Pyridine is vile stuff, but neverthe-
less has a smell somewhat like bad whisky. Much of the
filthy taste and smell of the blend can easily be got rid of,
and a little flavoring essence of whisky or brandy does
cute in thS price of white »nd >.'ethylated epmti

When an advt. appeared some years back in Sjdney
dailies for “an accountant, apply Box > ’
like “ Scottv’s ” man, shepherded the 1.0. box, also the
boy who cleared same, and found that advertiser was a

ences was accepted, /hen it suddenly occurred to the
’ boss to inquire how I came to know who had ad-
vertised f owned up, and was told that they
wouldn’t, dream of having any truck with a per-
son who adopted such disreputable tactics.
Wonder if it was this failure to appreciate enter-
prise that sent the firm “bung ” not long after ?

The English Queen’s Bench lately decided that
debentures transferable by delivery are negotiable instru-
ments, and thus, even if stolen, cannot be recovered from
bona-fide holders for value. This has already been the
better view of the law, and has been acted on since 1874
by the stock exchange and brokers, and the Vic. court
acted on it in the cases arising out of the Onyans frauds,
but there has been no clear English decision till now.

“ C.” : In a Sydney tobacconist’s shop, recently,
saw a man examining briar-pipes. He was evidently
hard to please, hut patient; and he sucked and pulled
at every stem and blew his breath through every calumet
of the lot. Then asked for more samples, but was told
that; he had exhausted the supply, so he walked out,
leaving, possibly, in the pipes enough microbes to scatter
cancer, tuberculosis, and things broadcast. I had come
for a briar, but I went elsewhere for it. Like my microbes
a little stale, at any rate.

London boomsters and promoters seem quite
unable to leave well alone. As soon as the Sons of Gwalia
started to make a name for itself in W.A., London put off
the Star of Gwalia and the Prince of Gwalia, and pro-
ceeded to incubate the Daughters of Gwalia and the Pride
of Gwalia. After these no doubt would have come the
Father and Mother of Gwalia.
The most remarkable point in the story of
the recent Newcastle (N.S.W.) tragedy, wherein
that well-known Sydney adventurer, T. W.
Miller, and a 20-year-old girl named Elizabeth
Altardyoe, were found dead together, poisoned
by cyanide of potassium, i< the statement given by
the murdered (or suicided) girl s mother to a
Sydney Daily Telegraph man :
I thought him the nicest gentleman I hart ever met—so
handsome, you know. . . . Poor Liz ! She was such a
good-looking girl, so bright and vivacious. ... Once he
took her up to Grafton with him. . . . On Friday night,
when she asked if she might go to Newcastle in the boat
with him, I said yes. Miller said . . . they might not
return till Sunday evening.
As it happened the witness’s unmarried daughter,
who (though she was engaged to be married to
another man —then in Westralia) had been allowed
THE NEWCASTLE
Miss Elizabeth Allardyce.
to go away for a two days’ excursion with ( the
nice, handsome gentleman who was “ <J | ie
in a thousand ” and could talk and play the
piano so beautifully, never returned at all.
The why of the double suicide, or murder and
suicide, is uncertain. Miller was the same
glittering crank who staggered the people ot
Hobart seven years ago when he appeared there as
“Lord Leamington,” and got into great woe for
bigamy, having married a handsome figurante
while his first wife, honest Sarah Jane Irish, was
still alive. The bogus aristocrat faced the music
cheerfully until the incongruous name of Sarah
Jane Irish was mentioned, and then his knees gave
way visibly. And when it was further mentioned
that he was married at a Baptist chapel by Parson
Soper, he went all to pieces like a cluke who was
being sued for non-payment of 3s. (id. for hall-
soleing his boots. To a man with a yearning alter
sham titles and decorations it must have been per-
fect agony to be named Miller and married to
Sarah Jane Irish.

There is no priest at the Chatham Islands, the

had settled there was slowly dying of cancer and
wanted absolution. The Kahu, on its two-monthly

815 GEORGE STREET, SYDNEY
(nearly opposite Railway Station),
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Prom way up in North Queensland The Bulle-
tin hears of two indefatigable cricket cranks who devote
all their spare time to a series of international test-
matoheB. One lunatio does duty for Our Boys, whilst the
other represents All England. Each in turn plays 11 suc-
cessive innings in his 11 different characters, and his op-
ponent the while impersonates all the bowling talent (if
necessary) on the other side. As captain, he takes himself
(as Richardson or Trumble) off the job if he is getting
severely punished, and hands the ball to himself (as
Noble or J. T. Hearne) and resumes the attack. Every
time a wicket falls the batsman registers a change of his
identity—from Hill to Darling, or from Jackson to Mac-
laren, as the case may be. Occasionally the pair of multi-
farious antagonists take an interval in order to check
their respective scores and bowling averages. At the
conclusion of a match they draw up a joint report in
choice journalese, stating that Gregory’s leg-hitting was
quite up to Syd.’s best form, and Hearne's bowling was
remarkable for its fine length, &c., &c. Then they ad-
journ to an imaginary pavilion, and the captain of the
losing team proposes the health of his eleven-fold adver-
sary, and says that the best men won, but he hopes to turn
the tables at their next attempt.
* * * *
At a Rawkes Bay (M.L.) cricket-match one
team made only 16. Their opponents replied with 23.
First team made less in second innings—l 4. Needing
only 8 to win, the other crowd went in to score a glorious
victory, but the whole job lot were sent back to the
pavilion without making a run. Record 1
* * * *
Little Briggs and other equally-expert Hinglish
critics have admitted that the best Australian bowling is
superior, on Australian wickets, to the more mechanical
work of the best professionals from ’Ome. If the bowling
is better, how about the batting ? Against the attack of
Jones, Noble, Trumble, M‘Leod, and Howell a second-best
Australian eleven made a bigger score than Stoddart’s
team was capable of in four out of five attempts, whilst
against M’Kibbin, Giffen, Giller, Laver, and Coningham,
the Australian eleven proved themselves far better bats-
men, on paper, than either of the All-England combina-
tions that Stoddy has brought out here. Given fair
health all round, the team tljat goes ’Ome next month
should, from an Australian point of view, whip All Eng-
land on both sides of the game. If the difference in
cricket conditions in the two countries will permit of All
England whipping Australia, the “ science of the game ”
isn’t half as scientific as it is cracked up to be.

J. Charles, who runs W.A. “ Tattersall’s,’
wrote to Perth Cricket- Council promising £2l to the fund
for bringing over the S.A. cricketers at Easter. He also
started a “ consultation ”on the opening match ! ! This
latter part of the business is strongly resented by sup-
porters of the game. If sweeps on big cricket-matches
became general, bowlers might be squared to give loose
Ones to certain batsmen, who in turn might run others
out. Fielders could drop catches, and even an umpire
might be greased.
* * * *
A Melb. daily once received a cable to the effect
that, “ Stoddart had chosen his team ; critics considered
he would find need of batters before end of season.” Of
course capitals don’t come through the cable, but the
man in charge put that right, and the amazed public read
this in the evening : “ Stoddart has completed the selec-
tion of the next English eleven ; competent critics de-
clare that he will feel the need of Batters before the end
of the season.” And then came a note in the usual way
explanatory of the cablegram—“ Batters is one of the
best county men of the year. He is at the head of the
English averages,” etc.
1 asmania s and Maoriland’s entrance into
interprovincial cricket introduces a physiological pro-
blem. Ought not these two additions to give us sturdy,
lasting players, for bracing climatic conditions are in
their favor; while from the opposite cause S.A. and
Bananaland should produce “ that-tired-feeling ” man ?
Yet it is almost vice versa.
* * • *
Maoriland Rugby Union authorities are con-
sidering suggestions for revision of rules with a view to
improving the game. That some change is necessary to
sustain public interest was obvious last season. Rugby
has degenerated - from a spectator’s view-point. That
new “ knock-on ” rule, among other things, has tended to
make the game too slow. The public chafes at the over-
free use of the referee’s whistle, necessitating continual
stoppages, the majority of which are for paltry infractions
that a discreet official would overlook. Spectators like to
get a glimpse of the ball sometimes instead of having it
imprisoned in packed scrums with opposing sides hugging
each other. Some good suggestions have been sent in
but others are absurd. One genius suggests that half a
point (why not half a pint?) should be scored for each
“ force-down,” and another cheerful idiot favors points
for punted goals!

Were Reedman picked for England and George
Giffen left behind, there would be in the inci-
dent something of an element of revenge. When Geo.
Giffen, then in the zenith of his career, was approached
for the ’9O tour, he made it part of his price that brother
\V alter should go. The latter’s inclusion robbed Reed-
man, admittedly one of the best juniors, of a trip.

A good deal of thishorse-recognition-under-any-
circumstances is mere Thomas-rot. The average man is
capable of riding a horse 40 miles one day and not know-
ing him the next. F rinstance—A medico in northern
N.S.W. imagines himself a great horse judge, and was
therefore, much disgusted at his latest purchase turning
out a weed ; so when his feed-man’s bill for a couple of
pounds came along he tendered the quadruped as pay-
ment, and, said he, “ VVe won’t fight about the change.”
Some weeks later he met a squatter friend who had just
driven into town. “Hullo!” said the doc., “that’s a
stylish-looking horse you’ve got.” “Yes; he’s a bit too
fresh for me—let you have him for a tenner, though.
Bred him myself.” Bargain cemented on the spot. Next
morning Dr. M'Galen asked his groom what he thought
Of the new purchase, and was much flabbergasted at the
reply: “Well, docth >r, me opinion’s not changed since
last time ye bought him.” “ Banjo’s” story of “'Partner”
repeats itself.
* * * *
A M.L. Chow, so fat that he could hardly quiz
the tote numbers, waded in at a recent country meet and
struck every winner in five races, good divs. returning
£175. The crowd surrounded him before the last race,
eager to know his final pick. “Oh ! put tree quid on
any tarn ting—allee same,” said he to the tote man, who
promptly rung it on a consumptive-looking moke of indif-
ferent aspect who hadn’t won a race for two years, and
didn’t seem likely to. But it got home by a nose this
time, and t 36 was added to “cabbagee’s” winnings
Current sporting nb■ • - i s , “Follow a Chinaman.”

The famous “Wren’s tote” in Johnston-street,
Collingwood (Melb.), was again raided bv the police the
other day, with but very little more success than usual.
There are ten ways of getting into the notorious
tote-shop, but the easiest one is barred by about eight
strong doors, and as the customer is taken in b} T instal-
ments, the last door being locked before the next one is
opened, seven of them are always fastened. Also, there
are about 60 ways out of it. This time the force rushed
the place via an adjacent tea-shop, and hewed their way
in with axes, but meanwhile the customers were pouring
like rain over adjacent roofs, down trapdoors and
chimneys, and through secret passages and cellars, and
only four arrests were made after all -three suspected
tote-conductors and a customer, presumably the old
slow customer who is always at the tail end of the retreat.’
They all got out on light bail, and the famous tote will go
on as usual. Attorney-General Isaacs is understood to
be desperately anxious to suppress it, but he has met
with no success worth mentioning up to date.
The simplest mode of suppression is for the
State to liee.ise the local racing authorities to run totes
openly on the racecourse, with a supplementary tote in
the city for the convenience of persons who want to put
on their humble, honest bit without going to the course
and take 6 per shent of the gross proceeds. But, if
Melbourne is too much bossed by the saints who ran
the swindle-banks of ’93 for such a thing to be
possible, something might, perhaps, be done by a
law providing that, when the police could produce
sufficient evidence to convince a Judge that a tote was
run in certain premises, His ’Onah would thereupon be
required to issue his order to the owner of the property
to shift the sinful thing inside three days. Said order
would cancel any lease or agreement the tote man might
have, and entitle the owner to the assistance of the
whole local police-force if necessary to clear his tenant
out. And if the tenant wasn’t out inside three days a
minimum fine of £5OO should then become due, and be
recoverable by the sale of the building and contents if
necessary. Provided the law doesn’t mind hitting the
sacred property-owner there are plenty of ways of getting
at the tote-man.

A leading Sydney metalHcian had a gambling
experience recently that caused a lot of talk at Tatter-
sail’s. The layer of odds became acquainted with a new'
arrival who put up at a fashionable hotel, and whose only
mission in life seemed to be to get rid of money quickly.
Bookie and his new-found friend played cards one night.
Bookie won about £2OO. They played again—continu-
ously from early Tuesday evening till the following
Thursday morning—by which time the new arrival’s
shirt-cuff showed that he had £2BOO coming to him. It
was paid.
* * * *
A certain horse-owner has a jockey who is deaf
for all practical purposes, and until the other afternoon
no one ever heard the boss address him when mounted
for struggle. At the sound of Deafy’s inquiring
“ Hey?” a crowd gathered round to hear this dialogue :
“Do you know what you've got to do?” “Hey?” “Do
you know what you’ve got to do?” “Hey?” “Do you
know what you’ve got to do?” “No : how can I ? You
never told me.” “ You’ll get well away, and let him run
his own race. He’s sure to die at the turn. Don’t knock
him about.” “Hey?” Here the crowd stampeded for
the ring, and left the owner yelling instructions. Thev,
in their wisdom, backed the next best, and had the satis-
faction of seeing Deafy’s non-stayer run his own race and
win it handsomely. The owner, presumably, had been
talking at the “fly-flats” rather than addressing the
jockey'.
* * * *
At a recent Melbourne race-ineeting a promi-
nent penciller took his little eight-year-old boy with him.
The favorite won, and the youngster, carried away by the
public enthusiasm, stood by innocently clapping* his
hands and hurraying like the rest. His loving parent,
turning round, spied him, and, in a voice of suppressed
passion, exclaimed, “ What the are you clapping
for, you little idiot ? Bad enough for me to lose without
any family applause ! ”
* * * *
“Scrip”: If race-clubs could only stick to the
neddies they disqualified in most palpable cas3B of swind-
ling, it might have the effect of decreasing the number of
non-triers, or of teaching jockeys to “ pull ” a little more
artistically.
* * * *
At a tin-pot M.L. horse-carnival, the rider of
second horse in one race protested against winner for
jostling. Decision : Accusation proved, but first horse to
retain stake ; its rider fined £2, and in default of payment
to be disqualified for life. Unique !
* * * *
“Tassy”: Ever noticed how many of our best
hurdle-race horses were, prior to being schooled over the
little sticks, sprinters only, who could not get over a mile
at racing speed to save their lives? Yet we see them
winning mile-and-a-half and two-mile hurdle races. The
only apparent reason is that the pace is so slow in jump-
ing races that they never have to gallop until over the
last fence, and then their turn of speed is all there for a
sprint home.
* * * *
Recent improvements at Flemington have swept
away a grand old landmark, which will be much missed
by such as have been drinking the health of two or three
winners in succession. The slippery mound that slanted
down to the ’freshment bar under the grand-stand has
passed away. Memories of bygone falls had endeared the
mound to most of the Fleming ton habitues. It was
either glassy or greasy, according to the state of the
weather, and it generally brought one to undignified grief
? aJT whisky had got home by a neck. Glen-
loth s Cup day was a great occasion for the mound.
IJundreds of punters, including teetotallers, descended
heels-foremost from its treacherous ridge, followed by
roars of hollow mirth. Glenloth’s victory had left very
lit tle room for merriment in the crowd, hut they enjoyed
themselves as well as they could every time an influential
citizen went travelling down the hill on the tails of his
long frock coat.

A BILE BEAKS MIRACLE.
Three Neighbors’ Corroboration and Declaration
Before a J.P.
One of the Greatest Cures of the Century.
(From the Adelaide “Advertiser.”)
A Proved Miracle.
Many wonderful cures have been placed to
the credit of Bilk Beans for Biliousness, and
we have now to chronicle the marvellous case of
an old lady of eighty summers, who has suffered
the most excruciating agony for the past 40
years, and has been discharged from a hospital
as incurable. Mrs. Bridget M'Arney, the lady
in question, resides in Gibson-street, Bowden,
Adelaide, where a reporter of the Adelaide
Advertiser interviewed her a short time since.
Mrs. M'Arney is a typical daughter of the
“ Emerald Isle.” She has lived at her present
address for nearly nine years, and in the dis-
trict for 17, and is very widely known. “ Tell
you the story of my illness ?” she said, in re-
sponse to a preliminary question ; “ certainly I
will, with pleasure.
“ About 40 years ago I became very ill. I
suffered from severe pains in the head, chest,
and stomach, and used to have bad fits of
retching, and always, on getting up in the
morning, had a bad taste in my mouth. I
could not enjoy my food, and at last became so
bad that I had to call in a doctor. He pre-
scribed for me, and I continued taking the
medicine, but it did me no good. I then
called in another doctor, who told me that I
was suffering from a disordered liver, and ad-
vised a change of climate as the only remedy.
I tried other medicines which did me no good,
so I resolved to try the change of climate, and
came out to South Australia. My health,
however, did not improve ; but, on the other
hand, I gradually became worse, and often
when venturing a few yards from the house to
get a little fresh air, fell down in the street,
and had to be assisted to my home. I gradu-
ally became worse, and my friends took me to
the hospital, but, after the doctors had nearly
physicked me to death, they discharged me as
incurable. When I left that institution I was
so weak that my daughter had to assist—
almost carry—me from the door to the tram, a
distance of only a few yards. The doctors alse*
told my daughter that I was not to be left
alone, as I might be called away from this
world at any moment.” “To look at you now,
Mrs. M‘Arney,” said the reporter, “ no one
would think you had suffered a pain in your
life!” “That is just how I feel,” replied
the old lady, cheerfully, “ and it is all
through Bile Beans.” “ What induced
you to try Bile Beans, after the best
doetors had failed?” “Well, I will tell
you. I saw a report in the paper of a
person who had been cured by them, and I re-
solved to try them myself. I obtained a box,
and in about a week my health began to im-
prove. I continued taking them until I had
finished the first box, and then obtained two
more, and, before I had finished the third, all
pain had left me, my appetite had returned,
and I was able to sleep well, and, alto-
gether, felt in splendid health.” “Did you
take any other kind of medicine during
that time, Mrs. M'Arney ? ” “I took
nothing whatever but the Bile Beams, and
that is why I know that they alone cured
me.” “ I must say you look well enough now,”
said the reporter. “Yes, and I feel well, too!”
observed the lady, “and, instead of dying, as
I was expected to do, I can now walk into Ade-
laide, a distance of about two miles—and,
after a short rest, return without feeling any
the worse for it, and, what is more, I am now
living by myself, and doing all my own work.
All my relatives and many of the neighbors
know —and will tell you —how bad I was before
I took Bile Beans. If it had not been for
this wonderful medicine, I am quite sure I
would not be alive to-day to talk to you ! I can
assure you I shall never be without a supply of
those wonderful Bile Beans.” As the reporter
wished the hale old lady good-bye, it was im-
possible not to feel that the cure was indeed a
marvellous one.

“/ } Bridget M l Arney , of Gibson-street , Bowden, in the

“ And I make this solemn declaration, conscientiously be-
lieving the same to be true , and by virtue of the provisions of an
Act made and passed in the sixth year of the reign of his late
Majesty King William the Fourth, entituled 1 An Act to repeal

Testimony of Several Friends
Margaret Carter, of Bth-street, Bowden, has
known Mrs. M'Arney for several years, during
the whole of which time, until a few weeks ago,
she has known her to be a great sufferer. She
says: —
“ She was taken to a hospital in Adelaide,
and after being there for some time was dis-
charged, looking quite a 3 bad as when she went
there. I have seen her many times during the
past few weeks, and on each occasion have
noticed a great improvement in her health—in
fact, she is now so well that she does her work
quite easily, and, what is more, takes a good,
long walk occasionally without feeling any the
worse for it. Her recovery has astonished me,
as when I saw her a day or two after she left
the hospital I did not think she would live to
see the week out.”
Mrs. C. J. Gliddon, of Gilbert-street, Bow-
den, states that she has known Mrs. M'Arney
for over five years, and knows well how she
suffered during the whole of that time. She
says :
“ I was present when she was taken to a
hospital in Adelaide, more dead than alive, and
saw her immediately after she was discharged
from the above institution as incurable. I
know that she was advised, as a last resource,
to try Bile Beans, and that after taking a few
boxes she was completely cured. She tells me
that she has not felt so well and strong for 30
years.”
Mrs. Mary Ann Rimes, of Gibson-street,
Bowden, says :
“I have known Mrs. M'Arney for about six
years. I knew of her severe illness—that she
was regularly attended by a doctor for over two
years—and I was present when she was re-
moved to a hospital.
“ The poor old lady was so bad that I cer-
tainly did not expect to see her come out alive.
I know that she has been taking Bile Beans
for some weeks, and am astonished at the re-
markable effect that medicine has had upon her
health. She certainly seems quite well now.”

Robert Shaw, L.D.S., M. 8., D.A., holds the
highest of medical honors, and has held positions
'of confidence, securing favorable commendation
throughout Queensland as one who loves humanity
and seeks by every means in his power to benefit it.
He states: “I have much pleasure in stating
that I have prescribed Warner’s Safe Cure very
frequently whilst acting as medical officer on the
Cairns-Herbarton Railway Contract, and obtained
more satisfactory results from it than any formulae
of my own prescribing.”
Men like Dr. Shaw do not speak hastily of
things of which they have not thoroughly tested,
and when such a well-known physician speaks in
such frank and manly terms, as he does of this-
remedy, there cannot be the slightest question as
to its good merits and its power to benefit man-
kind.*
Mr. Frank Senior, who has been chemist
to the N.S. Wales Governors for many years past,
has conferred a blessing upon the citizens of his
country by discovering a wonderful cure for head-
ache. The new remedy cures instantaneously, is
very palatable, and perfectly harmless to both
ladies and gentlemen. Moreover, it is perfectly
effectual, no matter what the cause of the head-
ache may be. This cure, the result of years of
experience, can be had in 4 sizes, by post i/4, 2/6,
3/8, 4/8, in N.S.W. only. To all the other colo-
nies 1/8, 2/8, 3/8,5/2. Beware of imitations. Only

POINTS
Let Federalists agree to call the Federal

NURSERY RHYME.
I love little pussy, her coat is so warm!
And if I don’t hurt her, she’ll do me no harm.
I won’t pull her tail, or drive her away —
But pussy and I will play all the day!
i Reid’s former barracker, Sydney Daily
Telegraph, “ appears in two capacities ” —in
provincial politics it supports him and regards
him as a heaven-sent Freetrade leader ; while, as
a Federal politician, it is now engaged in blasting
and blithering him in linotypic fury. When the
-Federal clouds roll by he will once more take his
orders from King-street.
Among the serious charges against financial
men, freetrade magnates, wool people, and
directors of various magnitudes, in Flanagan’s
pamphlet against Rowan, is one which
alleges that sundry Melb. people bought
a piece of land in N.S.W. with the
offering it to a prominent
N.S.W. politician in gratitude for ex-
pected help in connection with a N.S.W.
tramway concession that didn’t come
off. The politician’s name is not given.
Why should Way get only £4500 when act-
lng as Chief Justice and Governor of S.A., whereas
Darley, for similar duties in N.S.W., is allowed
to drawilO, soo ! Or, why should Darley, &c.,
while Way, &c. ? ’
According to its own just-published re-
turns, Westralia has lost 7482 people in the six
months to 28th Feb., ’99, by excess of departures,
which is rather rough on a province with 168 000
population and such a debt.
Sydney Sunday Shellback stirs up the
anti-Federal broth in this way : “Melbourne will
remain the Federal capital—there is no doubt
about that.” Also, “ Melbourne people mean to
have Albury as the Federal capital.”.
A feature of the first batch of Q. elections
was the support afforded mummer Bentley against
Dickson’s jackal, Foxton. Had a really good
Democrat taken the field, he would, on this show-
ing, have wiped the floor with the man of law.
Under the baleful influence of his front
name, Edwyn Lilley split the Opposition votes at
Oxley (Q.) election, defying the accredited demo-
cratic candidate who had been nursing the seat,
and Dicksonite Grimes crawled into Parliament by-
nine votes.
That anti-Bill petition to N.S.W. Parlia-
ment, imploring it to throw out the Federation
Bill on its ovvn hook and not have any referendum
could be boiled down to a sentence: “We, the*
anti-Bill crowd of Sydney, say we are 'in a
majority, but for God’s sake don’t give us a chance
to prove it! ”
Army boss Booth’s notion : “ What Aus-
tralasia wants is a peasantry, fixed on the land
living on it and getting their living from it; who
serve God and get salvation, and read the news-
paper (the War Car) once a week.” In most of
which the old man’s 70 years and Englishness ob-
trude themselves.
Melb.: The Age wasfor a long time a deadly
opponent of Federation and was only driven to the
opposite side through observing the headway
made by its hated rival, the sincerely-Federation-
ist Argus. The Age, in now daily publishing
columns of abuse of Sydney and its people, knows
full well that Sydney D.T. will reproduce these to
the prejudice of the cause of union. Foiled in its
.attempt to block the Federal consummation in its
own province, the Age is making a wily, despic-
able effort to thwart it in N.S.W.
Opportunity first, man second, or further
baek. If Federation comes shortly, Q. Premier
JJickson, the utterly commonplace person whose
supporters even admit that he is quite destitute of
convictions, will figure in papers, pictures, docu-
ments and history as one of Australia’s great men
who brought about the union of the provinces.
Five seats will shortly become vacant in
Tasmania's dreadful House of Landlords. By
Braddonian influence the whole five could be filled
by men a little less gruesome than the present
occupants, but it is a gridiron railway to a rasp-
berry that Braddon won’t use that influence. To
a weary politician like Braddon a House of Scape-
goats is a perfect godsend.
In its anti-Federal crusade, Sydney Dailv
Telegraph is now reduced to reporting at half-
i^ en gth the Sydney Domain utterances of
Mr. George Perry,” “Mr. Macnamara,” “Mr.
o. A. Jxosa (who turns up as a Sydney-im-
P°L fc e rs champion !), and “Mr. Kohen” with a
K, who “ said he was not generally a supporter
of the Legislative Council.”
Sydney D.T. has practically dropped the
cry, ‘Freetrade in Danger.” Reid’s tea-duty and
other tariff proposals last session have killed it.
Mongreha, with its duties on N.S.W. coal and
almost everything else, and its export-duty on
wool crossing the Northern border, is the province
the JN.c.W. Foreign-traders now put their trust
in, and we are to “wait for Queensland.”
S.A. Laborites have now decided to make
T ederation an open question, although chairman
-tSatcheJor and one or two other prominent leaders
are bitterly opposed to the measure. The whole
party unitedly opposed the original Bill at the
referendum last year, but a repetition of that
attitude at the approaching election would result
in wholesome defeat. The Laborites are, in fact,
so timid in the matter that strenuous efforts are
being made to have the federal referendum taken
subsequent to the district polling, instead of
along with it as at present intended.
Our little “reptile contemporary,” the
Richmond (N.S.W.) Gazette, states that at last
® I referendum “ the Federal Bill was defeated,
and The Bulletin lies most consumedly if it
again denies this palpably (sic) truth. If it
wasn t defeated, why was not Federation pro-
ceeded with ?’’ Well, if a majority of 5367 in
tavor of the Bill meant that it was defeated, why
then it was defeated, of course. And as to why it
wasn t proceeded with, it was simply a case of the
first horse being disqualified by the dishonest
judges who had their own money on the second
animal.
lired out by Jack Want, his wolves and
robbers, and by a long course of Sydney D.T.
charges of treachery, insolvency and worse, the
Vic. papers naturally exasperated by the latest
attack (on the Capital question) of the Cabbage-
Tree mob, begin to hit back. And when one
paper made some disparaging remarks about the
Sydney climate the Gabbage-Tree Mob, which has
cursed Melbourne for years past, whined piteously
about it in N.S.W. Assembly. Almost on the
verge of federation, the old Sydney v. Melbourne
jealousy is more virulent than it has been for
DRINKY ARITHMETIC.
No. 1: “ Where shall we go?”

years. A parallel in its tin-pot way with the
spectacle of Europe holding a peace-conference,
and simultaneously increasing its armaments
wholesale.
Although Tas. West Coast is the flyspeck’s
Labor centre, and has lately entitled itself to
another Assembly seat, the Labor crowd give no
sign of an intention to fill the gap with one of
their own candidates at the ensuing special elec-
tion. So far, pushing publicans and highly-
respectable storekeepers are the only aspirants
mentioned, but the miners may yet wake up
sufficiently to nominate a man of their own. With
the Coasters solidly on the job, a Labor-party of
half-a-dozen should be possible at the general
elections due at the end of the year. Launceston
will return at least one, Hobart ditto (Clipper
Paton’s Labor votes recently showed 100 per cent,
increase on his previous polling), and the Coast is
able, if solid, to do the rest.

heyday of

considered
that Austra-

white tie, opposed the resolution.
S.A. National Ass is spending tons of
money in running anti-Ministerial candidates at
f ii!° r c om ' Assembly elections. One cause
ot this fierce attempt to down the Govt, is the
tact that Kingston intends to make State fire-
assurance a prominent item in the Govt, pro-
gramme. S.A. has no local co. since the S.A.
insurance Co. died, but Tory magnates make nice
pickings on the boards of locally represented
foreign co.’s.
Delightful bit from Brisbane Courier :
We have to keep in mind that to get rid of the kanaka
by evolution is to assist the sugar industry, while revo-
lutionary methods are bound to cripple it. The evolu-
tionary process is even now doing what the impatient
critic would compass with a stroke. The actual number
of kanakas is less than in ’94.
“Getting rid of the kanaka by evolution ” is about
the neatest euphemism ever devised for the Q.
commercial slaughter of Polynesians. And so
this manuring of the cane-fields with human blood
assists the industry,” does it ? We should think
it does, for Queensland exports all her island
gua.no to Europe— not a ton goes on to a eane-
faeld. ... No need for it. . . . Polynesian death-
1* t four times that of the European popu-
‘ ‘ The evil that men do lives after them. ”
The Parkesian policy of always promising Local
Government in N.S.W. and never giving it—this
to keep ah political power in the hands of the
gang-in-ofiice—accounts for most of the (just now
suppressed) feeling against the Federal Bill
amongst local M’sP. Yet Parkes was a great
federalist, Quite half of the present roads-and-
bridges canvassers would have no further reason
tp.be if local authorities raised their own road and
bridge taxation, and, with a subsidy from the
general revenue, did their own work without the
necessity of having an agent roosting on the de-
partmental door-mats. The road-agent (which,
by the way, is Yankee for highwayman) will not’
if he can help it, vote for his own painful extinc-
tion.
The anti-Federal Sydney Telegraph got
up again last Thursday to allege about
how the 80,000 minimum did the anti-Federal
cause a lot of harm last June. Anti-Federalists
who would otherwise have voted in overwhelming
numbers stayed away because they knew the
f ederal party couldn’t raise the 80,000, but if there
had been no minimum the provincial crowd would
have won on its merits instead of being licked by
5367 votes and having to crawl through on a side-
issue by. disqualifying the majority. Also, the
party which says it could have won by sheer force
of numbers last year alleges that it is much stronger
now than it was then. And still it is howling for
another 80,000 minimum. Pathetic indeed is
this desperate anxiety of the Provincialist crowd
to do itself an injury.
Tasmania, where the Chinaman comes in
on a <£lo poll-tax, has long been the back door
through which many lepers leaked over in the silent
night to the Australian mainland. Last year the
island so far woke up that it passed a new'-Restric-
tion Act on the Natal principle, with a mildedu-
cational test for the incoming
heathen, and that Act is sup-
posed to have gone ’Ome for
Imperial assent. But it dropped
so completely out of sight that
many began to fear it had
fallen overboard en route. It was
passed in Sep. ’9B, and, according to
latest ad vices, there is still no news
of it—it has vanished, just as
some men do when they step out
to see another man about a dog.
Presumably it will turn up again
some day, unless somebody forgot it
at this end and it was never sent to Eng-
land at all.
Backhouse, M.L.O. (one of Premier Reid’s
appointees, by the way), demands a minimum
affirmative N.S.W. vote of 160,000 on the revised
Federal Enabling Bill. Last time the prescribed
number was 80,000. Backhouse characteristically
raises it by 100 per shent.
Citizens are presumed to take an interest
in the affairs of the State. Those who don’t must
abide the consequences. To enact that a minimum
vote must be given before any well-discussed
public question can be decided is to offer a premium
to the political indifference and the “tired feeling ”
which have ever been the curses of Australian
politics. If electors don’t take the trouble to vote
when a long-discussed question is up for final
decision, let it be “ their own funeral.”
Maoriland paid its first old-age pensions
at the beginning of this month. The pension
system is practical and methodical aid to the
poor ; while the sand-shifting jobs are only spasms
which die away again, leaving the workless masses
just where they were. Above all things the pen-
sions are paid out of revenue ; while the sand-
shifting and forest-thinning are charged to loans
and a future generation is left to pay for the
benevolence by which this one hands out a casual
crust to its derelict population.
Adelaide Critic :
The Kingston Govt, will probably announce its election
programme in a week or two, and it will inevitably con-
tain something for everybody. . . . And we are no
doubt to have State fire insurance, early closing, law
reform, adult suffrage, and all the other necessary sops
for the wretched crowd who have the gall to dub them-
selves Democrats. . . . Now is the time for the people
to work if they wish to arrest the mania for reforming
everything out of existence. “ Moderation ” should be
the watchword, “ hard work ” the motto of every elector
who wishes to preserve the remaining independence of
the people.
The real hard-shell Tory’s recipe for “preserving
the remaining independence of the people”:
Don’t reform the law; let all shop employes work
long hours, and don’t let every adult have a vote;
—the really independent man doesn’t vote, but
allows his boss or his landlord to do the governing
for him.
‘ ‘ Alone ” : Attended (at a safe and respect-
ful distance at first) the last meeting of the great
“Victorian Freetrade League, ” held in Prell’s
Buildings, Melbourne—the place where the boot-
trunk woman’s friend lived. At 20 minutes after
the advertised time, no Freetraders having shown
up, I was turning disappointedly away to further
consider the matter over a solitary beer,
when the appearance of two persons caused me to
wait a bit longer. I lingered around discon-
solately for another 20 minutes or so; but
nobody else came. Meanwhile the two had let
themselves go, and were explaining to themselves
that it was nothing but blind ignorance that made
the people indifferent to the “greatcause.” Being
one of the blind, ignorant people, I cursorily re-
marked that any policy that advocated sending
money out of a country for anything that could
be made in that country was economically and
manifestly rotten. Just here the meeting pub-
lished a contemptuous grunt, and went away from
me. Then something put the light out, and I was
left in my darkness.

DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
Staijd Aloos aS a Wonjao’S BsSt Frisi)d.
They Do Not Weaken. They Do Not Sicken. They Do Not Gripe.
A Cruel King.
ANOTHER SUBJECT IN THE DOMINION OF DISEASE
IS RESCUED BY DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS.
Nero at- his worst was overflowing with the milk of human
kindness compared to the king who held sway over Miss Maggie
Jones, Albert-street, Sebastopol, Ballarat (Vic.). Pity the su jec
of King Biliousness! The tyrants of old did not upset the
stomach and derange the whole human system. This is what hap-
pened to Miss Jones. She relates : “ For a long time I was sub-
ject to biliousness and fainting fits. Lately I have a lo o
people saying what a splendid medicine Dr. Morse s Indian Root
Pills are, and this induced me to try them. Now I can endorse
what others have said, as the Pills have cured me completely. 1
have not finished a bottle of them, and the improvement is so great
that I will not need any more medicine. I have, spent a consider-
able amount of money trying to get better, and Dr. Morse s Indian
Root Pills have cured me at scarcely any expenses. I should say
that there can be very little sickness in the house where these Pills
are used as the household medicine.”
A Great, Glad Surprise.
COMPLAINT PECULIAR TO WOMEN.—UNABLE TO DO
HER WORK.—DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
CREATE A SURPRISE BY CURING HER.
The man who digs a hole to make a well and finds he has
struck a gold-mine gets a surprise. It is the right kind of surprise.
Well, such a surprise came to Mrs. Harrison, Alexandria .Terrace,
Victoria Parade, Fitzroy (Vic.). She writes : —“About six weeks
ago I first used Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, and I must state
that I found them a most superior medicine. My complaint was
peculiar to women —languor, debility, and bilious attacks, which
combined to make my days thoroughly wretched. Indeed, there
were spells when I used to wonder in the morning how I could
manage to get through my household duties, and was forced to
struggle through the day when I should have been in bed. You
may imagine from this how genuinely surprised I vvas to get such
a valuable medicine as Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills after every-
thing I had tried failed to do me good. The Pills have made me
vigorous and well. I noticed the change from the very first dose.
I have since recommended them to many, and in every case they
have given perfect satisfaction.”
A Critical Period.
A MELBOURNE L ADY'S INFLUENZA.-SHE SUFFERED
FROM CHRONIC COMPLAINTS.—DR. MORSE’S
INDIAN ROOT PILLS MAKE AN ALL-
ROUND CURE.
In seeking for a small gain, Mrs. Kilner, 15 Sydney-road,
Moreland, Melbourne, found a great blessing. She was unlike the
people we hear of who are given an ell and who take a yard, but she
was given the yard when she only asked for an ell. Nor is she un-
grateful for her good fortune. She writes : —“ A few weeks ago I
had occasion to try Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills for influenza,
which was beginning to take a firm hold on me. They were recom-
mended to me for that terrible complaint. Previous to getting in-
fluenza, for a long time I had been listless, languid, and quite un-
able to do my work, owing, I believe, to the change of life. . I can
only describe my life as a most wretched one, owing to this condi-
tion. Well, the Pills not only cured me of influenza, but I was de-
lighted to find that I was cured of the depressed, run-down feeling,
and I became bright and energetic ; in fact, I am far and away
better than I have felt for years, and I take pleasure in recommend-
ing the pills to all who need a medicine for such complaints.”
Straight as an Arrow.
HE GLADLY RECORDS HIS RESTORATION TO HEALTH.
-DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS GET
THE CREDIT.
Truthful words are like well-aimed arrows ; they are straight
and pointed, and fly true to the mark. There is no fooling about
the truth. It always strikes home, and this is how the words
written by ME John IMcColl, 12 Caledonian-street, Paddington,
N.S.W., make such a deep impression on everybody who reads
them. He writes : —“lt .is with great pleasure that I send you
this letter to inform you of the great benefits I have derived from
the use of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. For years I have suffered
greatly from constipation, and have tried all sorts of medicines
other than yours, but without avail. A few months ago I was re-
commended to try your Pills, and am pleased to say they have been
in every way beneficial to me. I am now enjoying the best of
health. You may use this letter as you think fit, and I shall be
glad to always recommend your valuable medicine to all my friends
who may suffer from such complaints from which I am now free.
—
A Great Faith.
SUFFERED FROM THE HEART A FRIEND’S FAITH
IN DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS SAVES HIM.
Mr. W. J. Trim, Royal Hotel, Port Macquarie (N.S.W.),
should know the true value of faith. The man who believes in
not iiirig is a most unfortunate fellow. In fact, faith probably saved
Mr. Trim’s life, s'nceit induced him to try Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pill’s He writes: “Having been suffering for some time With a
pain round my heart, which caused me much uneasiness, a friend
advised me to try Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. Maybe he did
not know that they were good for the heart, but he considered that
they would cure anything. Well, lam of his opinion now, as the
Pills in question have cured me.”
A Real Bad Time.
A GOLD - DIGGER SUFFERS MUCH.—TRYS MANY
REMEDIES.—DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT FILLS
GIVE HIM A REAL GOOD TIME.
Mr. J, C. Price, at present employed on the breakwater, Port
Macquarie, N.S.W., is a gold-digger who has been going tiie usual
road of agony which Sufferers travel. He now writes to us to give
us the first good news of his recovery “ I desire to thank you for
the benefit received through taking Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
For two years I have had a real bad time with indigestion, and
during that time I was put to endless expense buying different
guaranteed cures, and when they failed I would despair of. ever
getting well again. Indeed, it seemed that my ailment was incur-
able, when a friend advised me to try Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. I took them with no great hope that they would do me any
good. I am happy to say, however, that they proved thoroughly
effective, and I am quite cured, and, it is worth stating, at very
little expense. I wish this had been the case with all those that
failed. I have no hesitation in recommending these Pills to any-
body suffering with the same complaint. You are at liberty tb
make use of this as you like.”
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
HAVE CURED THOUSANDS, AND WILL CURE YOU.
One of the roots from which these Pills are made is a sudorific,
which open's the pores of the skin, and assists nature in throwing
out the finer parts of the corruption within. The second is a plant
which is an expectorant that, opens and unclOgs the passage to the
lungs, end thus, in a soothing manner, performs its duty by
throwing off the ph'egm hnd other humors from the lungs by
. copious The third is a diuretic, which gives ease, and
double strong l h to the kidneys : thus encouraged, they draw large
amounts of impurity from the blood, which is then thrown out
bountifully by the urinary or water passage, and which could not
have been discharged in any other way. The fourth is a cathartic,
and accompanies the other properties of the Pills while engaged in
purifying the blood ; the coarser particles of impurities, which can-
not pass by other outlets, are thus taken up and conveyed off in
great quantities by the bowels. _

xnziko th© policeman’s lot happier. A way-back
sergeant, suspecting a man of a crime, told him he
was wanted at the police-station, and, having got
bixn there, said, “Now, I want you to tell me
where you were” on a certain evening between
certain hours. The statement was made, the man
signed it, and was then arrested and charged.
Judge Tin 0 B. P. Gibson admitted the statement
as evidence, but stated a case on the objection that
the admissions were made under compulsion and
without warning. The Full Court upheld Judge
Gibson. .
The N.S.W. Council’s demand that the
dice shall be loaded in the Anti-Federal interest
with a minimum of 80,000 or thereabouts is rough
on Reid. He cheerfully assented to that minimum
last time as being a fair thing, and denied that he
was committing an act of treachery in departing
from the agreement for a minimum of 50,000.
JNow he has to devour his own vocabulary, so to
speak, and declare that his own minimum is an
impossible disgrace, and that though it was quite
fair to break the old agreement for a 50,000 mini-
mum, it is gross treachery to break the new one
for no minimum at all. The draggled old fowl
has come back to roost.
Concerning a Barrier railway matter ;
, T *? e “ ana £er of the Silverton (Broken Hill-to-the-
border) Tramway monopoly announced himself to con-
test a local Municipal Council seat against the most
prominent and restless of the barrackers for the construc-
tion of a Govt, line from Menindie, on the Darling, to
connect via Broken Hill with the railway at Cockburn,
"j’j-u u son ' e h o w, despite great personal popularity
and the other man’s personal unpopularity, the manager
prudently retired. As a matter of fact, red-hot ant-ago-
n sm to the Silverton Co.’s monopoly is growing at Broken
Hill, and Ministers have encouraged the movement.
Lyne, however, does not believe that the Silverton Tram-
way Co. should be disturbed, a past Government haviri»'
given it certain rights; so one important wing of the
Labor-party is tied tighter than ever to the Yes-No
chanot-wheels. If Lyne remembered that at the time
the Silverton promoters were working their project
through, Mathieson and others had also a project for an-
other line, the route of which had been surveyed, it
might possibly affect his judgment.

F >r the pace he can go. will be breaking their hearts
And he ends with the “ Bobadil dash.”
But i here’s one’in the race is a fancy of mine
Whenever the distance is far—
Crosslake ! He's inbred to the Yattendon line
And we know what the Yattendons are.
His feet are his trouble they’re tender as gum !
If only his feet are got straight,
If the field were all Bobadils—let ’em all come
So long as they carry the weight.
For a three-year-old colt with nine-three on his back—
Well, he needs to be rather a star !
And with seven-stone ten we will trust the old black,
For we know what the Yattendons are.
He is sired by Lochiel, which ensures that his pace
Is enough, and a little to spare.
But the blood that will tell at the end of the race
Is the blood of the Yattendon mare.
And this “ Bobby ” will find, when the whips are about,
It’s a very fast journey and far.
And there’s just the least doubt—will he battle it out ?
But we knovi what the Yattendons are.
In the rest of the field there are some that can stay,
And a few that can fly—while they last.
But the old black outsider will go all the way,
And finish uncommonly fast.
If his feet last him out to the end of the trip
Bare-footed or shod with a bar—
If he once gets this Bobadil under the whip,
Then he’ll show what the Yattendons are.
The Banjo.

would not! But there are lots of
people who are doing' so; they are

save the £7.0:0 or £lO :0 : 0 that

It’s not the cheapest in price, but

Dr. Bowker, a political curio, of 11 years
continuance in N.S.W. Council, says he is dead
against the Federation Bill because it has the
referendum in it. Bowker “ considers that the
referendum deprives the people of the rii/ht of having
their opinions properly voiced.” The venerable
doctor, in his mansion at Darling Point, is ail
broken to rags lest the people should have their
opinions smothered by being allowed to say exactly
what they want. Also—
Dr. Bowker said the chief reason why he would vote
against the measure was that its operation would inevit-
ably lessen the capital employed in prof u lion. It
would be a continuation and intensification of i lie terrible
legislation which had recently been imposed in the form
of direct taxation, and it would place the burden of taxa-
tion on the masses of the people.
The average Fat Man is so much afraid lest the
tax on his big income should indirectly hurt the
masses that he would almost as soon let the
masses pay the tax themselves.
Sfc. Patrick’s Day dinners in Sydney oscil-
late between the riotous but interesting and
orderly but uninteresting. That of the other day
at Moore Park was a mere mutual-admiration
luncheon. The guzzlers were of as many races
and breeds as could be whipped in, nothing dis-
tinctively Irish in tone or tendency being allowed
to obtrude. The dinner that lost Henry Cope-
land his Cabinet post gave off sparks of Irish fire
and purpose anyway; and so did many other
dinners before and after. But that of the other
day was purely show, show, show. Heart was
gone, soul was gone. The guzzlers were too
amiable to carry either.


Sure Cure
for Colds
When the children get their feet wet and
take cold give them a hot foot-bath, a bowl
of hot drink, a dose of Ayer’s Cherry Pecto-
ral, and put them to bed. The chances are
they will be all right in the morning. Continue
the Cherry Pectoral a few days, until all
cough has disappeared.
Old coughs are also cured; we mean the
coughs of bronchitis, weak throats and irrita-
ble lungs. Even the hard coughs of consump-
tion are always made easy and sometimes
cured by the continued use of
Ayer’s
Cherry
Pectoral
Your own doctor will explain this to you.
He knows that wild cherry bark is the best
remedy known to medical science for sooth-
ing and healing inflamed throats and lungs.
You may rely upon Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral tfo
stop your cough.
Beware of worthless imitations. The name
Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral is blown in the glass of
each bottle. Put up in two sizes.

W. H. Malyon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir,—For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “ Ligmolliene,”
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “ Cum Grano Salis," and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing “ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully, GEORGE J. O'REGAN.
WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY

My dear Mr. Malyon,— August 21st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suffered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M‘Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours
sincerely, THOS. LE GAY HOLTHOUSE, M.R.C.S., L.

lhe Wesleyan Conference in Melb. ex-
pressed a fear that the Spirit of Wesley is weaker
than of yore. A fiery young cushion-puncher
complained that, “Preachers did not preach, as
they used to do, the clear-cut distinction between
the con verted and the unconverted. They were
beginning to fancy that there was not so great a
difference after all between the saved and the un-
saved—were,-in fact, beginning to assume that all
the members of the congregations were in the
chu eh undergoing a process of salvation.” For-
tunately the Wesleyans have not yet started to
assume a possibility of salvation for anyone who
doesn’t go to church at all. Nevertheless, it is
evident from aforesaid remarks that Wesley's
Spirit must be deteriorating :
More aidermanic amenities. N.S.W. South
Coast alderman extends hand to. ex-alderman,
just defeated. “Thrown-out” man refuses to
take it, saying he’d “ rather take a blackfellow’s
hand.” Other retorts that he “ only offered his
hand out of sympathy. Under any other circum-
stances, he’d prefer to shake with a Chinaman.”
John Wesley in his wisdom knew
The Truth of what he loved to lull.
He comforted his chosen few
By dooming all the rest to Hell,
Down into Tophet’s Pit they slid
Unless they did as Wesley did.
The multitudes who laughed andsvig,
And had a somewhat pleasant time,
He sentenced, in his wild harangue,
To transportation to a clime
Where things are made absurdly ’ot
For such as deem his dogmas “ rot.”
John Wesley knew that girls and boys
Are simply born to bear the rod ;
He scowled at childhood’s fleshly joys,
And filled the kids with fear of God.
And O ! it was an awful life
That Wesley led his lawful wife.
A lot of unsuspected sins
John’s new religion brought to light.
Woie, lambs with stubborn, tufted chins
Maintain his laws of Wrong and Right,
But not as grimly as of old,
When John was shepherding the fold.
Their fathers’ way of finding grace
Is not so vehemently taught.
Men are not damned in every case
For “ doing as they didn’t ought.’*
Sometimes the Nonconformist eye
Will wink at sin upon the sly.
Come down to earth John Wesley’s wraith !
Come down to earth without delay,
And put new brimstone in the Faith
Before its stubborn hair turns grey.
Come down, or up, from where you dwell
And give the easy-goers Hell !

Aifaline Herbal Remedies.
Kalgoorlie, September 12,1898.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know,
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.

complaining of rheumatic attacks. With kind regards,
I have the honor to be, yours truly,

Dear Sir, —Having suffered for some time from a com-
plaint of the liver and kidneys, for which I took medical
advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Aifaline Remedies, and their effect was
magical. I have often since recommended them to my
neighbors, all of whom have felt the benefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,
as several doctors had given me up, as my husband can
testify.—Yours truly, (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.

they, have effected a complete and permanent cure, al-

doctors without effect. For the benefit of those who may

gratitude, you are perfectly at liberty to publish this short
noted'* the interest of suffering humanity.—Yours Grate-

Rescued from Nervous Suffering.
Mr. THOMAS MUDIMAN,
The well-known Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-street, Sydney,
states, on oath, how his shattered nervous system was
completely cured and restored.
Statutory Declaration.
I, THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-
street, Sydney, in the Colony of New South Wales, do
hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the NERVES, which affected me so much that
I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried
several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail.
Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rass-
mussen’s Purely Herbal ALFALINE VITALITY PILLS,
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare COM-
PLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and although
this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since.
The ALFALINE PILLS also cured my wife, and I make
this solemn declaration conscientiously believing'the same
to be true.
Declared at Sydney this 29th day of April, 1898.
THOMAS MUDIMAN.
CHARLES COLLINS, Justice of the Peace.

COUGHS, COLDS ontheCHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
i ■
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“ Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. * At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I- got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Haipin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“ After suffering from asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try 'Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883,14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cure me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power. ” Signed by
the Rev. John Sinclair, Myers-street, Geelong, and 59
other leading residents.

MORE WORDS OF COMFORT FROM A WIDE-
AWAKE MAN.
Launceston, Tasmania, 23/2/*99.
Mr. MORRIS, the much-travelled agent, gives his
opinion of Mr. Webber’s Vitadatio as under—and at the
same time hands us his photograph that there may be
no mistake as to the gentleman referred to. He says :
It vas while we were playing in Melbourne I first heard
of Yitadatio through Mr. Palmer, the agent, who as-
sured me he had been cured of Hydatids and Bright’s
disease of the kidneys of 14 years’ standing by the use
of this great remedy. I had been a great sufferer with ,
Kidney and Liver troubles, which gave me great incon-
venience in my calling, and tried very many medicines
to effect a cure, but all was of no avail. I then went in
for a course of Vitadatio—and with such good results,
it having cured me completely—and I am again in
splendid, condition,mil the ill-effects of my trouble have
disappeared—and, moreover, I cannot keep quiet on
the subject. I give Vitadatio my strongest recom-
mendation to all who complain of being in any way
“ off.” lam told as a blood-purifier Vitadatio has no
known equal, and I quite believe it.—Yours gratefully,
J. MORRIS, Agent Fitzgerald Bros.’ Huge Combined
Shows.
WHY will so many ladies rush to operations which
are extremely dangerous, often fatal, and at such an
expense (financially), not to mention physically, when
they can be cured by VITADATIO, at a minimum of
cost and no pain ?
209 Fitzroy-st., St. Kilda, Feb. 25,1899.
Mr. S. A. PALMER, Agent for VITADATIO, Melb.
Dear Sir.—For about 12 months I had been troubled
with enlargement of the liver and indigestion. The
usual treatment produced no good effect, and hearing
of Vitadatio I determined to try it. After taking five
bottles I feel quite recovered. This medicine is a grand
tonic and enables one to relish his food at all times, is
easy and pleasant to take, and does not necessitate
absence from business. For people engaged in seden-
tary employment nothing could be better. Wishing
you every success, I remain, yours truly, THOMAS
FRASER, C.E.

A CASE WHICH BAFFLED THE SKILL OF THREE
NOTED DOCTORS CURED BY SIX BOTTLES
OF VITADATIO.
Mr. W. Webber. Hagley.
Dear Sir,—For about 15 months I was a great sufferer
with what three noted doctors said was sluggish liver
and indigestion. None of their treatment did me any
good. In December, 1893, I tried six bottles of VITA-
DATIO, which put me thoroughly right, and I have not
since been troubled with my old complaint.—Yours
truly, SAMUEL BADCOCK.
AI.—PROOFS BUILT ON PROOFS.
NO JUGGLING FOR THE SAKE OF BUSINESS.
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.
A knowledge of how to blend herbs is necessary to
cope with the diseases of this life. The cures effected
by VITADATIO is proof that this knowledge has been
attained. It has wrought great cures where the
sufferers were said to be “incurable.” All chemists
sell it. Thousands are drawn to look at the Angelus
by Millet. Such pictures are invaluable moral teachers.
They send the lessons down, into the heart more effec-
tually than the choicest words of eloquence. Our
Great Herbal Remedy, VITADATIO, sends a thrill of
joj' through the whole system, by giving great bodily
strength, great nerve strength, great mental strength,
and great digestive strength.
THE DOCTORS Wf»E CALLED IN FOR
TWENTY-tfVVO YEARS.
Launceston.
Dear Sirs.—l feel it a duty which I owe to the public
to say a few words in favor of your VITADATIO, which
has done me much good. About twenty-five years ago
I had a severe attack of Inflammation of tiie Liver,
which left that organ in a very weak condition ; in fact,
so much so that three or four times every year I re-
quired the doctor to “ patch me up.” It is now about
three and a half years since I was recommended to try
VITADATIO. The effect was most wonderful. After
taking five bottles I did not feel I had a liver, so
thoroughly had that organ been put right, and so
easy did it do its work. From the first day I began the
use of VITADATIO to the present hour, I have not
required the services of a doctor for what was to me for
so many years a most distressing Liver Complaint. It
gives me great pleasure to recommend VITADATIO to
the public, and, on that ground alone, you may make
any use you please of this.—Yours faithfully, JOHN
GOODGER. Witness—l. L. Forbes.
George-str. Baptist Church, Fitzroy, Oct. 3, 1898.
I have known Mr. A. J. Wylie intimately for the past
three years and it affords me much pleasure in testify-
ing to his high Christian character. I regard him as
one upon whose word I could place the strictest reli-
ance, and whose natural ardor of temperament has de-
veloped into a fixed and permanent habit. His restora-
tion to health is little short of miraculous, knowing, as
I do, how, for a short time, his life seemed to hang upon
the slenderest of threads.

Mr. S. A. Palmer, Agent VITADATIO.
Dear Sir, —I have been.a great sufferer for the last six
years, have had the best medical advice in Christchurch
and Dunedin without receiving any satisfaction, was
told my disease was cancer or abscess in the bowels.
After the doctors had failed to effect a cure, I was ad-
vised to try Webber’s VITADATIO, which I did, and
after taking one dozen large bottles of it a thorough
cure is the result. Now I am able to return to my
work, and can confidently recommend VITADATIO to
all who are not enjoying good health ; and am thankful
this greet remedy is now in the colony of New
Zealand. —Yours very truly,

OBSTINATE INACTION
OF THE LIVER:
An Absolute Cure
The Case of
Mrs. Sarah Hall
(From the “ Windsor Gazette.”)
(by our special reporter.)
A representative of this paper called on
Mrs. Hall, who lives next the railway line
at Richmond, N.S. W.
“You have been ill, I believe,” said the
reporter ?
“ Yes, replied Mrs. Hall, but I am pleased
to say lam better now. The start of my
sickness was obstinate constipation, which
for a long time
Defied Every Medicine
I tried. Owing to the weakening effect of
purgative medicines I was obliged to discard
them, and, anyhow, they were of no real
use, for I found they only tended to con-
firm the ccfnstipation instead of curing it.
[Note. — Mrs. Hall is quite correct in her
opinion here The use of purging pills only
aggravates complaints of the digestive tract.
The organs get educated to the use of the drastic
cathartics of which pills are composed. The
temporary relief is alone due to the escharotic
and irritant action on the secretory glands.
The dose has to he continually increased as the
disease progresses. Purgative pills do no
good whatever, and besides greatly weakening
the system, the glue or chalk used in coating
them is highly injurious. — Ed.] “ I also suffered
from severe and continuous headaches, which
is not to be wondered at under the circum-
stances. Every now and again I was taken
with
A Bilious Turn.
Food of any kind was then distasteful to
me, and I promptly vomited what I did
man-'ge to eat.”
“ Did you have any listinct pains ? ”
“ Yes, sharp pains u ider my shoulders and
lower down the back now' ahvays troubled
me. One
Continual Dull, Heavy Ache
always oppressed me. The whole of the day
I was dead tired. If there was anything out
of the way that I wanted to do it would take
me about a quarter of an hour to make up
my mind to tackle it; and if I worked for
a few minutes I had to sit down for an hour’s
rest afterwards My appetite grew' worse
and worse till I didn’t think it worth while
to cook. Nothing could tempt me, and I
would as soon eat a small piece of dry bread
as the most dainty dish. Even a bit of
fcread would give me a pain in
The Chest and Stomach,
and sometimes when I ate a little some-
thing which I fancied would be more
nourishing, I should have the most agonising
pain for three hours afterwards. Windy
spasms came on, and these gave me greater
pain than I ever thought possible for a
human being to suffer. I swelled out ter-
ribly, and as this distension went on my
stomach would press on my lungs and heart,
causing intense agony and a feeling as though
I w'as
About to Suffocate.
Once or twice the pain and distension were
so awful that I thought I was not going to
get over it. ”
“ Did you have a doctor ? ”
** Oh yes, I did, and he said my liver was
diseased, but his medicine did but little
good, and that only temporary. I really
believe I might as well have drunk so much
water. Nothing did me any good, aud the
medicines I got from the chemists w r ere of
no earthly use. lam a strong woman, but
my health and strength gradually broke
down. A bad nervous collapse was the next
result of my long-continued illness.”
“ How did this shew itself ‘l ”
** I couldn’t sleep at nights. I couldn’t
keep my head still on the pillow. It
Twitched Backwards and
Forwards.
I turned round in bed often enough, but
wherever I put my head it was just the
same—jumping and twitching as though I
had St. Vitus’ dance. All night long I was
like this till I was dead worn out, when I
should fall asleep, but my head still kept on
twitching while asleep. My nerves got
intensely sensitive. The trains which pass
close to my house every day used to worry
me, although I was thoroughly accustomed
to their noise. I didn’t care to visit my
friends, and never went into town unless I
wasabsolutely compelled. Nothing interested
me, and I began to look on the dark side of
everything. I became very melancholy.
Strange f ars for the future beset me con-
tinually, and L as always frightened some-
thing dreadful was ab ut to happen.”
“ 13id you look ill ? ”
“ I looked very bad indeed. Ask tltfe
neighbours. My skin began to look a dirty
yellow colour. My eyes ached and felt
heavy, and you would find me supporting
my aching head with toy hands, and wishing
the day was over, and when night came, as
I explained, I could get no rest. When I
think of
What a Miserable Time
I had then I hardly know how I lived
through it When a poor woman feels that
the doctors can do nothing for her, and every
day she is getting weaker and
Nearer her Grave,
you can readily understand what a hopeless
state she falls into, and how eagerly she
clings to the weak st hope. 1 was like this
when I had a gleam of hope.”
“ Yes, Mrs. Hall, what was it?”
“ Well, I started trying a new medicine,
which I found totally unlike all the others
that I had been taking. It was Clements
Tonic—it did me
A World of Good.
You’ve no idea the change it made in me in
a week or two’s time. I threw off the
melancholy, and positively began to feel
hungry. Gradually my whole system under-
went % great change for the better, My
nerves got as steady as a rock. I could feel
that the blood in my v< ins was once more
circulating briskly, and instead of being as
heavy and down hearted that life was not
worth living, I felt lively and could go about
my work
As Happy as the Day
was long ; and that’s just the difference a
healthy or a diseased liver makes to a life,
Clements Tonic also cured my constipation,
and all the other minor symptoms went
away, too.”
“ May I publish what you’ve said?”
,f Yes. I feel so grateful for the very suc-
cessful cure which Clements Tonic has
effected for me that I should like everyone
to hear of it.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sun was fieroe, the wind was hot—
The dust blow thick and thicker;
And two perspiring citizens
Got arguing of liquor.
“Now, hark to me,” said Number One
(The man who did not drink),
“I’ll tell you what a drunkard did—
You tell me what you think.”
“Speak short, my friend,” the toper said—
I’m dry as any brick,
Two letters I’ve to send away,
Two stamps I’ll have to lick.’’
“ A week ago,” said number one,
I stood just where we’re speaking,
When an old, gray-bearded, withered man
To me for bread came seeking.
“I gave him threepence, and his eyes
With gladsome moisture glistened ;
A feeling queer I felt just here,
As tc his tale I listened.”
“ With words of blessing, then he left
To purchase bread ?—no fear !
He hied him to the nearest pub.
And straightway called for Beer.”
“ Oh, say no more,” the other said,
“My sympathy is hearty,
Your feelings must have been like mine,
With such another party.
“A week ago, like you, my friend,
I stood just where we’re speaking;
An old, grey-bearded, withered man
To me for beer came seeking.
“ He said, ‘ To tell the honest truth,
I’m feelin’ somewhat dry, sir.
And, if a threepence you can spare,
A glass of beer I’ll try, sir.”
“ I liked that man—that honest man 1
I gave it him with pleasure.
But what I said to him I’ve since.
Repented at my leisure.
“ What did he do ? Deceitful dog !
(‘God bless you, sir,’ he said.)
Then hied him to a baker’s shop
And bought—a loaf of bread ! ”

Shades of Governor Arthur and John
Price ! It is enough to make Eaglehawk Neck
blush for shame. Within the two ends of a recent
fortnight two prisoners escaped from Hobart gaol.
Both followed similar methods, though each found
a different track to liberty—through a hastily-cut
manhole in the ceiling to the roof ; thence clam-
bering along by easy stages, finally dropping
gently down into an adjacent garden arid vanish-
ing. When the mail left, the escapees were still
at large. Attorney-General Urquhart, after per-
sonal inspection of the gaol, bluffly expressed the
opinion that any ordinary prisoner left to himself
for five minutes could escape. One of the escapees
has served two years of a nine-year sentence for
illegally entering.
The Gentler Sex—A Sketch
from Life.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lahgb, pleading, wistful eyes lookup with baby
innocence from that nun-suggestive face. Like a
realised ideal she fills the imagination ; gracious,
low-voiced, perfect in manner and speech the
exalted feminine in look and movement. Com-
manding adoration inevitably from every man of
us; hearts yielding homage and ears most rapt
attention, as the rose-bud mouth ripples forth
“ I suggested knocking out two of the front teeth
to prevent recognition.” And—“lf I had known
the body would float, I would have ripped it
open ! ”
Is Thekla Dubberke abnormal in mentality, or
is she merely more candid than her average sister ?
The question is disturbing. It is mostly the mule
student who faints at the operating-table, while
the sweet young nurse placidly mops up the blood.
It is the husband who blushes in the Divorce-
court, while the wife smilingly discourses on mat-
ters of severely domestic interest. Also, angelic
creatures slice up liver and tripe in Sydney small-
goods emporiums.
Which recalls the Casey family.
When the ripened fruit was lying in worthless
heaps under the orchard trees, and the melons
amidst the corn were turning their green flanks to
gold, Mat Casey bought the annual sucker and
housed him in the dog-leg stye. The whole
family welcomed the visitor like a brother, car-
peting the stye with doughy oranges and peaches
hard as bricks. Mat himself never passed with-
out adding an unreliable melon or a dubious
pumpkin to the heap, and each morning carefully
measured the girth of the pig with a string kept
with a knotted record. The attentions of Mrs.
Casey were no less careful. She daily washed and
scrubbed the porcine guest. The pretty Miss
Caseys, Maud and Ethel, found a playmate in
Piggy, who would stand up to grunt salutation
over the log fence, and rumble internal satisfaction
when they scratched his poll.
As the pig neared maturity, the calm of family
life was broken by hot discussions between the
girls.
“No, Maud ;it was your turn last year. I’m
sure I’m big enough. You went to the picnic,
and you get all the chances —it’s not fair ! ”
“ Well, I don’t care ; you went to the dance.
Mother said I could—and you can help hold him.”
At last came a day when Piggy filled the string
to the last knot, and, said Mat to the wife, “He’s
fit, Bell. Are you ready?”
“Of course I’m ready. What sort of man are
you—not to be able to do a simple thing like that.
Sharpen a knife for Maud, will you.”
The blade trembled in the man’s hand over the
grindstone, while the girls clamored about him for
possession ; and, when the wife came down the
yard with the axe, Mat dropped the knife and
fled. He crossed the orchard, leaned over the
dividing fence and resolutely stuffed his ears with
his fingers. “ Are you right, Mat ? ” shouted the
wife. “Goon ! ” came the hardly audible reply.
The pig was liberated. Maude and Ethel held
on by his hind legs while Mrs. Casey adroitly
brained him with the back of the axe—what time
Ethel sat on his prostrate form, and Maud deli-
cately cut his throat.
At tho distant fence Mat, despite his closed
ears, could hear the dying squeals—the choking
gurgle of the blood. His face went white; he
pressed his fingers harder into his ears.
When all was still, Maud, with her smiling
madonna face, stood up triumphant. “Didn’t I
stick him well, Mother?”
Mrs. Casey nodded approval, as she shouted
across the orchard—“ You can come now Mat.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Most women have a forte—the pathetic appeal
was hens. The pathetic appeal is woman’s most
effective bait: it confers upon the man, in addi-
tion to the usual sentiments, the gratification of a
large intention of benevolence.
Hippleton thought it would be an act of charity
to take this poor, lone, helpless innocent into his
heart, and shelter and protect her. Eventually he
desired to do it, and was much gratified. She
made him. pleased with himself, and there is no
surer way to a man’s affections.
She posed as a friendless, suffering creature,
craving sympathy; but one whose misfortune it
was to be misunderstood even by those who should
have been most anxious to tend and comfort her.
Harvey Hippleton might have seen that the rela-
tions who had taken the orphan into their family
circle were assiduous and tactful in their efforts to
make her comfortable and happy, but he did not
observe it. When he was in Ethel’s company she
monopolised his faculties.
Ethel was not a clever girl, and Harvey was not
more of a fool than the average, but she deluded
him to the top of his bent. She had dark, lan-
guishing eyes, which she rolled clumsily, with the
disingenuousness of a ballet-girl ; but he found
them expressive only of suffering borne with
humility. She was stupidly, incurably lazy;
hated the calms of suburban respectability with
inward ferocity, and longed for vulgar gaieties ;
but he thought her a gentle lady of weak health,
galled by an odious obligation.
He proposed and was accepted. She clung to
him, weeping, murmuring that he at least under-
stood her. This 'ovo had saved her from some-
thing or other unspecified.
They were marr ed, and the usual disenchant-
ment began—but it began earlier than usual.
What maddened Hippleton most was to find his
wife resuming her old pose of the afflicted and per-
secuted innocent, but now it was he who misun-
derstood her. She still rolled her eves, but nowit
was in the direction of other men, particularly in
that of Horace Conyers, a slim, fair man with a
complexion and small feet. Already Ethel had
told Conyers that lie alone really understood her—
which he did not. A women reproaches the men
who do not understand her, but she hates the man
who does.
Although Harvey and his wife had had a quarrel
or two about Conyers, the young man—who was
still in love—did not doubt Ethel’s fidelity; he
questioned her discretion only, and they quar-
relled about that. But of late they quarrelled
a>out most things. Mrs. Hippleton continued to
languish, and Conyers to offer sympathy. Hip-
pleton thought his wife’s sole object was to irri-
tate him, but at length he was impelled to speak
his mind to the man, and Conyers, with a fine
contempt for the fool-husband, answered inso-
lently. In the fight that started on the spot
Horace was grievously man-handled, and then he
was kicked ignominiously along the whole length
of a passage, and down ten stone steps.
Mr. and Mrs. Hippieton quarrelled over this—
quarrelled brutally, with bad language and broken
china.
“ You have degraded me in the eyes of the
world,” was the wife’s lament, damnably iterated.
. Hippieton defended his position : “ The man
insulted me to my teeth. As if his attentions to
you were not insulting enough ! ”
“It is you who have insulted me. You never
understood me, never ! Oh ! if I were not alone
in the world—alone ! alone ! But you have pre-
sumed on my defencelessness all along. I will
leave you.”
And so on, and so on, until Hipp eton had
smashed the last vase, and then he grasped his
hat, confounded by the invulnerability of a wife’s
unreason.
“ I will leave you ! ” he said, purple with pas-
sion, “ and I will come back when you send for
me—not before ! ” He flung out of the house and
away.
Hippieton took up his residence at an hotel, and
waited for his wife to come to reason ; but, happen
what may, the sex only comes to its own reason.
He still believed in her basic honesty, and expected
his recall every hour. He waited for six days, and
it did not coine. On the seventh night he sat late
at his bedroom window, gazing in the direction of
his home. He ached to return—pride alone with-
held him. The streets had long been deserted,
and as Hippieton gazed, absorbed in bitter
thoughts, a luminous spot grew out of the black-
ness just where it had seemed to him his house
must stand. At the same moment there came to
his ears the clangor of a big bell.
Hippieton sprang up and started from the room.
He rushed down the stairs and into the street,
hatless and coatless. He was going home.
The young man’s instinct had been true to him
—his house was afire. When he reached the spot a
crowd was already congregated in the street, and
the firemen had battered down the door, but were
standing irresolute.
A policeman attemped to keep Hippieton back
with the crowd.
“For God’s sake, let me go!” he cried. “My
wife is in there. My wife, man ! ”
“ Best leave it to the firemen, sir. You ”
•Hippieton sent him down with a blow, and
sprang up the steps and past the firemen into the
burning building. A minute later the crowd saw
him tear aside the blinds of an upstairs window
and peer out, as if seeking a way, and it cheered
him wildly. He disappeared again, and a strange
hush fell upon the people, and they were silent
till he staggered forth from out the flame and
smoke, bearing in his arms a human form swathed
in blankets, just as he had plucked it from the
bed.
A fireman took the figure from his arms and
laid it upon the ground. Two others supported
Hippieton tenderly. His hair and whiskers were
burnt away, his face was blackened and disfigured,
and his hands and arms were not nice to look
upon.
“She is unconscious,” he muttered, pointing.
“ Only the smoke. The hospital—quick ! ”
The crowd pressed closely as the folds of the
blankets were hastily thrown aside, disclosing a
pale face, an immobile, handsome face, peacefully
insensible —the face of Horace Conyers !

As I rode in the early dawn,
While stars were fading white,
' I saw upon a grassy slope
A camp-fire burning bright;
With tent behind and blaze before,
Three loggers in a row
Sang altogether joyously—■
Bull up the stakes and go !
Pull up the stakes and go,
The world is free, and so are ice,
Pull up the stakes arid go.
As I rode on by Eagle Hawk,
The wide blue deep of air,
The wind among the glittering leaves,
The flowers so sweet and fair,
The thunder of the rude salt waves,
The creek’s soft overflow,
All joined in chorus to the words—
Pull up the stakes and go !
Now by the tent on forest skirt,
By odor of the earth,
By sight and scent of morning smoke,
By evening camp-fire’s mirth,
By deep-sea call and foaming green,
By new stars’ gleam and glow,
By summer trails in antique lands—
Pull up the stakes and go !
The world is wide, and we are young,
And sounding marches beat,
And passion pipes her sweetest call,
In lane, and field, and street ;
So rouse the chorus, brothers all,
We’ll something have to show.
When Death comes round and strikes our tent —
Pull up the stakes and go !
Pull up the stakes and go,
The world is free, and so are we,
Pull up the stakes and go.

The natural life of a dog is from 12 to 14
years. A London Field correspondent
The oldest dog I have ever known was a collie, belong-
ing to Lord Ogilvie. He died at niv infirmary from a
compound fracture of the femur, having been run over
by a butcher’s-cart, at the age of 23. I was instructed to
have his name and age inscribed upon the coffin in which
he was sent to Scotland to be buried. The next oldest
dog was 19 years, and a nurse was kept on purpose to at-
tend him. He had a bronchitis-kettle in his room, and a
hre all the year round, and wore red flannel drawers, be-
sides the usual dog clothing. He was literally “ sans
ej r es, sans teeth, sans everything,” and was fed on beef-
tea, and “ the softest of puddings without any plums was
the dish of all others that suited his gums.” The natural
life of a dog we believe to be 12 years or thereabouts.

Two days with a Maori Chief.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Honk Wktere Tk Rerenga, hereditary chief of
the most powerful sept of the Ngatimaniapoto
tribe, had been for 20 years an outlaw with blood
on his hands and a thumping reward in pakeha
gold on his head.
His name ? Well, his life’s history is epitomised
in his name. He told me, when we became
sufficiently acquaintedfor confidences, that he had
been “caught young” by the missionaries, who,
during his boyhood, had worked their way up the
pleasant Waikato Valley with the Bible in one
hand and a handful of cherry-stones in the other,
inculcating a knowledge of the white man’s Atua
and planting orchards as they came.
Hie chief was a small, shirtless rangatira when
a good missionary solemnly threw some waimaki-
riri (very cold water) in his chubby copper-
colored face and solemnly told the wondering tribe
that the name of the lad was to be “John Wesley.”
“ Hone Wetere ” is its Maori equivalent.
Hie name, I gathered, was rather against the
inclinations of Wetere’s father, who had been
attracted to the white man’s religion by the
lengthy genealogies of the worthies of the Penta-
teuch and by the glamour of the warlike deeds of
the fine old chiefs, Aperahama, Ihaka, and
Hakopa, as related in Genesis and the other puka-
pukd of pakeha. Hone’s father would have
preferred as a name for his son that of Joshua,
who had destroyed his enemies’ pah with a blast
of trumpets, or that of Solomon who had three
hundred wives and other lady friends so numerous
as to exhaust the capabilities of mere Maori
arithmetic. It would have taken the money-
counter in the pakeha bank at Akarana to have
told you their number correctly ! Nui tangata !
What a man ! What a man !
But the missionary had said that there was to
be no more war and no more polygamy, and the
name he had put on with the sacred water was
one of peace and virtue, and must remain for ever
and ever.
Then 20 years passed, mostly in singing hymns,
and the Maoris found that the religion of the
pakeha did not open up according to sample.
“We looked up to Heaven, and prayed to the
Atua of the pakeha, and when we looked down
our land was gone ! The pakeha had stolen it
while we were speaking to his God.”
So the Maoris rose in rebellion against Queen
Wikatoria, and believed no more in the God of the
white man, though they continued to have a rever-
ence for Joshua and other mighty men-of-war men-
tioned in the puka-puka of the missionaries. Who
could help admiring these?
And the Maoris slew many of the pakeha land-
stealers, and they killed , some of the missionaries
too, and drank their blood out of their own com-
munion-cups ; for had not these lulled the Maoris
with sweet hymns while the surveyors were steal-
ing the whole country-side by means of their
three - legged - magic - cannon - with - a - gl ass - eye-in-
the-muzzle ?
Hone, on his first war-party with the pakeha,
had shown himself a man-slayer of might—a real
kaitangata —and this he could prove by the notched
death-register on his greenstone mere, and he had
proudly added to his baptismal name the fearful
title of “ Te Rerenga ” —Anglice, “ the snag.”
But the arms of the pakeha at last prevailed,
ihe Ikiti Pipi (65 Regt.) and the soldiers from
Ireland, with green on their cuffs (18th Royal
Irish), and Von Tetnpsky’s men, who fought for
pleasure (the volunteers), came and drove the
Maoris, step-by-step, from the plain-land, and
Hone and the rest of his tribe were forced into the
fastnesses of the Mokau country. Here they were
safe as long as they remained within the borders
of the land where the Queen’s writ did not run,
but a cordon of pakeha forts and military posts
prevented forays on the rich lands of Taranaki, to
the southward, or on the rolling downs of Wai-
kato, to the north. And so the outlaws hungered
on their sterile_ hills, and with sore heart looked
over the beautiful plains wrested from them by
the pakeha, partly by chicane and partly by supe-
rior prowess.
I have described the Mokau country as “ im-
penetrable,” and so it is. I was out on an expedi-
tion with Minister of Public Works Mitchelson
and some surveyors when I first met Hone.
Mitchelson, desiring to cross the Mokau bush
from Ruangaraha on the Mokau River to Strat-
ford near New Plymouth, pub his thumb on the
map and said laconically, “ How far? ”
‘‘ Eorty miles,” said surveyor Carkeek.
Two days? ” said Mitchelson with a question-
ing glance.
“No, six weeks,” answered Carkeek. “We’d
have to chop our way right through the bush, and
a mile a day would be good travelling.”
So we decided to journey down the river to its
mouth, and thence along the coast to New Ply-
mouth and civilisation.
A few months before this conversation took
place. Native Minister John Bryce, hopeless of
completely pacifying the country, had pardoned
some hundreds of Maori rebels, Hone Wetere
amongst the number. As Hone controlled a river
rich in coal and perhaps other minerals, it was con-
sidered politic to further bind the ex-rebel to the
Crown by conferring on him the post of pilot of
the Mokau with ,£4O a year as salary, and a brass-
bound cap of naval pattern and a pilot-boat, as
recompense for his services. When we met Hone
we round him thin and gray from his 20 years of
hardship. But he was grateful for the amnesty
a 2. d absurdly proud of his new dignity as a public
othcial. Down the arrow-swift river, between for-
bidding cliffs which showed the coal measures on
their scarped sides, we journeyed in Hone’s
ancestral grand canoe ” manned by 70 male and
female rowers. The chief, dressed in a flax mat
and with his much-prized cap on his grizzled locks,
stood in the stern-sheets and deftly steered us
through a thousand dangers of rapid and snag—
dangers which one had scarce time to realise ere
they were passed ; and when we reached the lower
valley, where the widening of the river diminished
the speed of the current, he had time to converse
with us on matters that were foremost in his
mind.
“ What name of that fellow who killed the
giant with the stone ? ” he suddenly asked.
“ Eh ? ” said Mitchelson, startled.
Carkeek also “ passed ” on the question.
‘David,” volunteered our chainman, who had
been making surreptitious advances to a Maori
maiden amidships.
{ Y ps .> E)avid, said Hone, evidently pleased.
Kapai David. Him father of Solomon. Kapai
Solomon ? Kapai Adam ? Kapai Eve ! Kapai
Esau ? Kapai Paul ? Kapai Moses ? Kapai
Habakkuk ? ” Hone was apparently under the
impression that this glib evidence of his recollec-
tion of his old missionary instruction would be
accepted as a demonstration of loyalty.
“ Miterehena,” said the chief presently to the
Minister, “you know the whale that eat up
Jonah? Maori all the same Jonah; Pakeha all
the same whale. Now Jonah come out of the
whale’s belly and be good friends with the.
whale.”
When we reached Hone’s settlement at the
mouth of the river we found that the one object
of interest was the newly-arrived pilot-boat.
The men were carving posts for a boat-house;
the women scrubbing away at the brass work of
the new toy. Hone, even before he had shown us
our whares, devoted a good 20 minutes to the
feverish examination of the gunwale of his beloved
craft, spick and span in its coat of white and blue
paint. When he detected the smallest pin scratch
he uttered terrible imprecations, and the brass-
polishers and the wood-carvers bent to their tasks
with redoubled energy, furtively glancing at the
exasperated rangatira.
Amongst the chief’s most treasured possessions
was the torn page of a child’s religions, book. It
bore a picture of Moses bearing the tables of stone
down Mount Sinai. It was.because of this picture
that he nearly worried the lives out of his pakeha
guests with questions as lo the sequence of the
Ten Commandments. After much mental travail
we pieced our recollections together—you can’t
expect politicians and pressmen to remember the
Commandments—and supplied the chief with a
pretty good paraphrase of the Decalogue.
Next morning we found that under his direc-'
tions a Maori carver had scribed on a board a
Maori rendering of the Decalogue. We stood
round it with appropriately grave faces, Mitehel-
son and Carkeek translating when our knowledge
of Maori failed. Hone followed our eyes with
rapt interest. When we got to tekau (ten), CfSr-
keek’s facial muscles began to work painfully, and
Mitchelson had a broad grin, for the Tenth Com-
mandment had no bearing on the sin of covetous-
ness, but read :
“ Thou shalt not damage the paint on the pilot-
boat, neither shalt thou leave the oars on the
beach ; and any man who does not get into the
boat one minute by Captain Hone Wetere Te'
Rerenga’s watch after Captain Hone Wetere Te
Rerenga has said ‘All aboard!’ shall be surely
put to death.”

gives energy and power.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
7
Mrs. L. Kennington, of Station St., Petersham, New South Wales, sends U*
the above portrait of herself, with the following letter :
“ I have used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and have found it a wonderful strengthen-
ing and invigorating tonic and restorative. .
“Some time ago I caught a severe cold and an attack of rheumatism fol-
lowed. I suffered terrible pains, could not eat or sleep, and feared I might be-
come a helpless invalid. .
“I did not obtain any relief until I was given a prescription for Sarsa-
parilla.’ My husband took it to a chemist, who said, ‘Try Ayer’s.’
“ I noticed a decided improvement from the very first, and I was soon able
to do my work again. I know of several, people who owe their good health to
this great medicine.”
These remarkable results are not due alone to the sarsaparilla, m Ayer s
Sarsaparilla. They are due to the combined action of many ingredients. No
other sarsaparilla contains the same medicines. There is no other sarsaparilla
like “Ayer’s.” This is why the people call it
"The World’s Greatest Family Medicine."
“ Ayer’s ” cures. You know this. You have to experiment with others,
and you can’t afford to do that.
For removing impurities from the blood, for making thin blood become
rich and iife-giving, for restoring strength and vitality, and for building up the
nervous system, there is but one medicine:

“The fire* night I had slept a little from sheer exhaustion. The
next was terrible. I vomited incessantly; I was chilled to the bone, and
could not warm myself. I suffered horrible pain in the head, and through-
out my whole body. Next day, of course, I was a wreck. They told me I
had been delirious half the night I remember nothing of the day; but
next night I got a couple of hours’ sleep, and was rather better in conse-
quence. But vomiting went on steadily, and the fourth night I was again
delirious. The next day I was as bad as ever; but, thanks to a good
dose of Bee cliam’s “Rills, i had an excellent
night, and I truly believe that they saved my life. I knew well where I
picked up this fever—in the marshes of Mwenzo, and near Kituta—and the
killing thing was being unable to stop to cure it; the ten days on the lake
especially—often without food for twenty-four hours—nearly finished me.
I felt certain at the time that I was done for; and I very nearly was.”— See
“ Three Years in Savage Africa ,” by Lionel Becle — Methuen <k Co., London.
Mr. Lionel Decle covered a distance of over 7000 miles at one
stretch, between Capetown on the South and Mombassa on the Bast coast of
Africa. It is worth noting that this “ unique journey ” would probably
have been cut short ; and, to quote the introduction by Mr. H. M. Stanley,
M.P., “its vivid record” would never have been penned had not Mr.
Lionel Decle provided himself with a supply of

BONNINGTON & CO., Manufacturers of Irish Moss, See.,

Dear Sirs,—Being a sutierer for years from fibroid phthisis and bronchitis, I de-
sire to add my testimony in favor of your Irish Moss. As a soother of irritating
cough, with much expectoration, I have found it to be the most effectual of anything
I have tried. It loosens the mucus, which, therefore, comes more readily away, and
the cough is thereby considerably pacified.
I remain, Yours respectfully,
THOMAS STOKES.
Always ask for BONNINGTON’S.
