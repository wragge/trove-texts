The Bulletin


National Notebook
Before the flood
7T*he Bulletin this week moved to 181
A Elizabeth Street from the old home
at 252 George Street, which it occupied
on November 11, 1931, in the middle
of the depression and on the verge of
the 1931 Federal election. Before that,
the building had been the headquarters
of a wholesale hardware store which had
fallen victim to the depression.
Mr M. H. Ellis, our staff member
of longest standing, writes:
I had not then joined the staff and
first entered the new offices a week later
with George Patterson to arrange a
series of political advertisements. George
Patterson Advertising have become the
new owners of the building as The
Bulletin now moves out.
The Bulletin had had a number of
earlier offices, all except the first of
which had been haunted by the sub-
terranean presence of the Tank Stream.
It had begun a fitful life in the Imperial
Arcade, in Castlereagh Street, had pro-
gressed to Bulletin Place, off Pitt Street,
where even a king tide could flood it
out.
It had progressed to 214 George
Street, where the nether recesses seemed
always flooded and where the senior
members of the editorial staff divided
their time between ward-
ing off the army of impe-
cunious poets above flood
level, and the impinging
waters below. It was
difficult to say which flood
was the more menacing.
The Tank Stream follow-
ed the staff to 252 George Street and
haunted it to the end.
When the move of 1931 was made,
the legendary days when James (“Henry
Horsecollar") Edmond presided at his
desk were over, and S. H. Prior, who
looked like President Wilson in one of
his more convivial moods, was editor,
with the brilliant and daring John Webb
as his associate. The Lindsays, Percival,
Leason. B. E. Minns, Souter (of cat
fame) and Oswald Pryor were all draw-
ing for the paper.
The subject of the first leading article
printed at 252 George Street on Novem-
ber 11, 1931, was inflation and the pro-
posal to devalue the Australian pound.
Hie word “inflation” was in process of
becoming familiar. The cartoon that
week was about an impending tramway
strike and The Bulletin moves again
this week to 181 Elizabeth Street to the
accompaniment of the anguished wails
of the victims of a current bus strike.
1 he Australian scene obviously shows
little intrinsic change in the basic issues
of its bread-and-butter politics. But
The Bulletin itself has changed and
none of those who produced it in 1931
are here to move with it. I came in in
June, 1933—though I had contributed
long years before and am the only
piece of nearly original furniture to go
into the van which takes the rejuvenated
paper to its new home.
Success
TTow to succeed in modern fiction:
The publisher of the paperback
edition of Nicholas Monsarrat’s “The
White Rajah” (Pan Books) quotes a
review in “Books and Bookmen”:
“Lust, passion, cruelty, and hate . . .
a story told in the best Monsarrat
fashion.”
Bobby
1%/|r Robert Helpmann offered us an
hour of his time and an hour, to
the minute without any furtive glance
at his watch, it was. Timed like a per-
formance. There is no stage at which
Mr Helpmann would imagine that he
wasn’t worth an hour of anyone's time.
But it takes far less than an hour to see
why he is still at the top of the tree,
and, apparently, on top of the world,
when other ballet-dancers of his vintage
are retired or forgotten. “I know per-
fectly well what I have
accomplished and xvhat I
am,” Mr Helpmann said.
This poised intelligence
is refreshing. So, too, is
Mr Helpmann's assurance
that wild horses wouldn’t
drag him back to Aus-
tralia to live. “I'll never come back
here because the centre of things
is in London,” he said. “Also, I think
any Australian in creative fields can do
more good by working abroad and
coming -back when he has something
good to offer. And he’s better appreci-
ated here if he’s not seen too often.”
This doesn’t mean that Mr Helpmann
doesn’t enjoy his visits home.
“Coming back revitalises me,” Tie told
us. “It enables me to find my essential
roots again. You know, it was interest-
ing coming here with Katharine Hepburn
in 1955. She adored the place, and she
made me see a lot of it with fresh eyes.
For instance, it was she who first saw
the lyrebird's dance, which now, nine
years later, has become the inspiration
for my ballet, ‘The Display.’ Imagine
a bird being able to dance! And it’s
been here all the time.”
Mr Helpmann said that one of the
pleasant things about coming home was
that “everybody was so nice to him.”
“And they’re not to everybody, you
know,” he said. “I think it’s because

I’ve never tried to kid anyone. But I
find it very touching when people are
pleased that I’ve done well.”
Mr Helpmann said he felt he had
noticed more changes for the better in
the nine years since he was here last
than he had noticed in 1955 after being
away since 1932. “But there are so
many changes,” he said. “In those days
you couldn’t even wear suede shoes
without being marked out as odd.”
But Mr Helpmann isn’t too sanguine
about the chances of young dancers who
follow in his footsteps and go overseas.
“The standard of dancing is now so
much higher than it was when I got
going,” he said. “Young dancers in the
corps de ballet are so much better. Then
it was easy for me to make the transition
from dancer to actor, simply because in
those days the Sadler’s Wells and the
Old Vic were under the same manage-
ment. I had only to go to them and
say I wanted to do a play. I took my
first part at the Old Vic in 1936 and
I didn't leave the ballet until 1950. But
it wouldn’t be so easy for a dancer these
days because he would have to convince
strangers that he could act.”
Mr Helpmann has a busy few months
ahead of him. He returns to London
for a revival in March at Covent Garden
of his ballet “Hamlet”. In May he will
do a spectacular—song .and dance, any-
thing—for BBC television. In lune he
will appear in a film of Huxley’s “Brave
New World,” being made by Samuel
Bronston in Spain. He will go to Japan
in July to direct a stage production of
“The Tempest,” and will be back here
in August for further performances of
“The Display.” We hope he notices
further changes for the better here then.
Playwrights
■Robin Lovejoy returns to Sydney,
slightly flushed from the success of
his production of “Troilus and Cres-
sida” at the Adelaide Festival to take
over his new assignment for the Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust. Mr Lovejoy will
look after the lunch-hour theatre, renew
the search for Australian plays, run
the playwrights’ workshop and supervise
readings by professional actors of likely
local plays.
Although Mr Lovejoy has remained
on the Trust's strength since he returned
from overseas a year ago, this is the
first indication of what the Trust in-
tends to do with him, or, in fact, that it
intends to make much use of his talents at
all. The new job at first sounds rather
like the scrapings of the barrel after
all the good jobs have been handed out,
but Mr Lovejoy doesn’t see it like that.
He sees the four jobs as linked, and
as, perhaps, offering the first logical
path for local playwrights to take from
hopeful amateurism to experienced pro-
fessionalism. In theory, you'll be able
to go from the playwrights’ workshop to
professional readings of your play and
then to a lunch-time presentation of
your brilliant one-acter.
Although Mr Lovejoy himself has
worked at nearly everything in the
theatre in his time, he doesn’t particu-
larly subscribe to the theory that young
playwrights need a theatrical apprentice-
ship. “That has its uses”, he says,
“but the first thing is to create an eco-
nomic climate in which the writer can
get the best possible outlet for his
work. This gets right away from the
hit-and-miss level of ‘Summer of the
Seventeenth Doll’.
“I want to bring the writer and the
market closer together. For instance,
if we get a good short play for the
lunch-hour theatre, the chances are that
it is a good television play too”.
Mr Lovejoy said he regarded the
lunch-hour theatre as “taking the
mountain to Mahomet”.
There seems no reason why Mr Love-
joy’s new field cannot yield results, pro-
vided, of course, that the local play-
wrights, who have been grizzling quietly
for so long about lack of help, can
write plays that people want to see.

PLAIN ENGLISH
After “The Group”—See
You in Court
signs have been there for
A some time signs that a new
censorship row was about to break
out, that the creeping liberalism of
our censorship administration could
not last much longer without pro-
voking the bluff, hearty, too often
dirty-minded bigots to counter-
action. Consider what has happen-
ed. Firstly, with extreme caution,
but nevertheless clearly, the Com-
monwealth Literature Censorship
Board and the Minister for
Customs have shown despite a
few concessions to the yahoos —•
that they value both liberalism and
literature. Secondly, State censor-
ship authorities have been unusually
quiet. The Queensland Board of
Review is still licking its wounds
after its humiliation in the High
Court when it tried to ban some
harmless comics. Victoria’s Vice
Squad had until last week
no new discoveries to boast about.
In NSW we had last year the
most striking symbol of the new
atmosphere the case of the Scpik
River statue, which the magistrate
found not to be obscene: it was
obvious from his judgment that he
was a little unhappy about this
verdict, but, one assumes, given the
state of public opinion, he knew
that any other verdict, with a
court order to destroy the statue,
would bring the roof down on him.
Coinciding with the spread of
this modest Australian liberalism
has been a much greater liberalism
overseas and much more outspoken
literature. Literary censorship has,
at last, almost disappeared from
the United States and Britain where
writers are again as free as they
were in, say, the eighteenth century.
The result is that both serious and
trashy works of a type which would
not have got past the Customs
sheds a few years ago are now
being imported into Australia and
freely distributed.
A blow-up was inevitable. At
first there was the formation of such
groups as the Sydney League of
Decency (inspired by Ohio). Then
there were the rumbles about
“Lolita” being used by English
students at the Australian National
University, which was most signifi-
cant for the very fact that there was
any controversy at all: traditionally
the Minister for Customs has always
permitted students to import other-
wise prohibited books and has
never set himself up as a director
of university education. But, of
course, it was Mary McCarthy’s
“The Group” that brought things
to a head with Melbourne’s Vice
Squad pioneering the new tech-
nique of not openly banning books
but of frightening booksellers into
withdrawing them.
TTIE question now is what is to be
done to ensure that the few gains
we have made against censorship
are not lost.
Fundamentally the best way to
push forward the limits of liberalism
is through action in the courts to
establish rights, instead of depend-
ing on the goodwill of Govern-
ments. Court action, of course, can
lead to defeats, but if we are right
in our belief that enlightened public
opinion is on our side it is almost
certain that the courts will be more
liberal than the politicians and
policemen a view strengthened
by overseas and Australian ex-
perience.
From this, two things follow.
Firstly, booksellers and publishers
must, as overseas, get into the habit
of fighting every case in court. They
should no longer meekly knuckle
under to police and political bully-
ing. This will cost money, but organ-
isations can be formed to raise it.
Perhaps the best result of “The
Group” farce in Melbourne is the
formation of the Freedom to Read
Committee which is determined to
raise money and co-operate with the
book trade in fighting cases.
In due course this principle in
dealing with State police should
be extended into the Customs field
and court challenges issued to
Customs prohibitions, whether
made on the advice of the Litera-
ture Censorship Board or not. There
is nothing legally final about a
Customs ban, but in this country we
have been content to bellyache
about Customs censorship without
once going to court to try to
reduce it.
Further, despite the good work
the Literature Censorship Board has
done in the past, it seems that the
time may have come to abolish it
and replace it with an open, judicial
tribunal. Here our model could well
be New Zealand. Contrast its new
Indecent Publications Tribunal with
our Literature Censorship Board.
The Board meets in private; it has
no real authority, only the right to
advise the Minister who may reject
its advice; it does not deal with all
serious books, only literary ones
(and therefore was not consulted
about C. H. Rolph’s “The Trial of
Lady Chatterley”); it does not make
its reasons for the decisions public;
it does not issue any reports; it
has an Appeal Board but there is no
further appeal; it deals with legal
matters but it does not have law-
yers, let alone judges, among its
members.
The New Zealand Tribunal is
open to the public; its proceedings
are reported in the Press; it deals
with all sorts of books; it is headed
by a judge (Sir Kenneth Gresson
whose famous judgment in the NZ
Court of Appeal that “Lolita” was
not obscene was then overruled by
two less enlightened judges); and
its decisions can be challenged in
the Supreme Court.
A tribunal such as this in Aus-
tralia would take the arbitrariness
out of Customs censorship, would
encourage the book trade and
readers to fight cases in Court, and
being a judicial body and not
merely an advisory group of ama-
teurs would have more authority
in the States and may make the Vice
Squads vacate the literature field
and concentrate on vice.

THE VOYAGER
Why 82 Died
Confusing “ to ” and "two"?
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
MR JUSTICE SPICER
Royal Commissioner
T>y a bizarre coincidence one Sydney
cinema last week opened with one
of those perennial English comedies
about the Navy. But only a few blocks
away from the theatre the Royal Aus-
tralian Navy was before the public in a
Royal Commission which, far from be-
ing lighthearted, was rather an epilogue
to a tragedy in which 82 men died.
The Royal Commissioner, Mr Justice
Spicer, began the hearing of evidence on
how the destroyer HMAS Voyager
came into collision with the flagship of
the Australian fleet, HMAS Melbourne,
off Jervis Bav on the night of February
10.
The Commissioner has not only to
enquire into how the collision came
about, but also on the preparedness of
ships, equipment and crews and the facts
relating to rescue operations and the
treatment of survivors.
From behind a stack of statements
several feet high the counsel assisting the
Commission, John William Smyth, QC,
in characteristically flat unemotional
tones told the story of the collision and
the sinking of Voyager, Mr Smyth, an
active amateur yachtsman, is a hard
advocate, capable of implacability, where
necessary, as at least one member of the
legal profession in Sydney can testify.
He told the Commission that it might
efnerge that there had been some mis-
understanding over the meaning of mes-
sages sent from Melbourne to Voyager-
In reply to a question from Mr Justice
Spicer, who interrupted his address, Mr
Smyth said that it was correct to say that
if the orders sent had been carried out
there would have been no collision.
The messages sent between Melbourne
and Voyager in the last crucial few
minutes have been tabled at the Com-
mission, but so far publication has been
restricted because of codes. However,
in his opening address Mr Smyth did
refer to a mesage sent by Melbourne
to Voyager “Turn together zero to
zero”. This order meant that the two
vessels should endeavour to turn and
use the same turning circles. Later on
Friday during cross examination of
Tactical Operator Everett, of Melbourne,
who sent the messages through the radio
telephone, the question of possible con-
fusion of “to” and “two” was raised
but not in specific terms.
In his opening address Mr Smyth
canvassed the question whether messages
should be repeated instead of merely
being acknowledged. He also referred
to the fact some men on Voyager
were trapped because spanners to open
the escape hatches were not available.
Mr Smyth also spoke of one statement
that an officer on board a life raft after
the sinking had to read a pamphlet to
learn how to operate it gnd cited
the opinion of some members of the
crew that more lives would have been
saved if lifebelts had been available in-
dividually to the men rather than being
stored as is peace-time custom.
The first witness
npHE first witness was Rear-Admiral
A Otto Humphrey Becher, Flag Officer
Commanding the Australian Fleet. A
fluent witness, the Rear-Admiral gave his
evidence in a firm, didactic tone with
gestures to match. Mr Smyth spent
some time working around the question
of whether orders should be repeated in
transmission, before he bluntly asked
the Rear-Admiral: “You will agree that
in future all messages should be re-
peated?” The answer was just as blunt:
“No.”
Mr Smyth’s cross-examination was
wide-ranging and searching. He even
touched on the question of the availabil-
ity of drink to officers on board ship.
Rear-Admiral Becher answered that it
was generally understood that officers
who were to keep watch should not
drink, but that there was nothing to stop
them.
The cross-examination of the Admiral
by his junior, Captain R. J. Robertson,
commander of Melbourne, touched off
the first muted clash of the Commis-
sion. It emerged that the Captain had
spoken to the Admiral on the preceding
night. When Mr Smyth suggested that
this might have been done to ensure
that the Admiral would give answers that
were favorable, Mr Norman Jenkyn,
QC, for the Navy, objected. Eventually,
however, the Admiral admitted that it
might have been unwise.
Captain Robertson, who only a few
months ago sat as President of a court-
martial which found another officer
guilty on one charge, is representing his
own interests at the Royal Commission.
After only a few days it is already clear
that tension exists between the Captain
and Mr Smyth, sitting at the other end
of the table. After a number of asides
about a chart, prepared by Mr Smyth
and tabled. Mr Smyth finally objected.
Mr Justice Snicer told Captain Robert-
son to be patient for a while, pending
evidence.
Shrewd question
Tt began to emerge later that Mel-
bourne's actual course at the time of
the collision would be a matter of dis-
pute. The pilot of a Gannet aircraft, Lt-
Commander Dadswell, who witnessed
the collision from the air, gave evidence
that the wake of Melbourne appeared
to be crescent-shaped, while Leading
Tactical Operator Everett said he had
the impression that Melbourne was still
turning slowly to port at the time of
the collision.
The Commission was in camera for
most of Thursday and part of Friday
morning while witnesses from Mel-
bourne gave evidence.
The first witness after the Commission
came out of camera was Everett, who
told the orders on the bridge in the
seconds before the moment of impact.
His evidence indicated that no one on
the bridge knew of the danger of col-
lision until Voyager was within two or
three hundred yards. Everett said that
he looked up to see Voyager only
that distance away and after that he
heard an order “half-speed astern”. Then
after Voyager was within 80 yards he
heard another order, this time from the
Captain, “full speed astern”.
A shrewd question from Mr C. L. D.
Meares, QC, appearing for the relatives
of Lt Price, officer of the w'atch on
Voyager, shed some light on some of
the confusion about times of the collision
and associated messages. Three QCs had


questioned Everett about times he had
taken from his watch when he made log-
entries and being answered with precision
as to minutes, but the first question from
Mr Meares was to look at the watch
and he found it to have no single
minute marks.
No one wants to make an estimate of
how long the Commission could last,
but there are millions of words to go.
CENSORSHIP
“Freedom to Read”
A test case over “The Group”?
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
A. G. RYLAH
“Badly”
T etters went out last week to a
number of leading figures in the
universities, the publishing and book-
selling trades, to writers, editors, pro-
fessional men and others, inviting them
to a meeting to discuss the formation of
“a permanent committee on freedom to
read, and to consider, if desirable, the
steps necessary to make a test case of
the banning in Victoria of Mary Mc-
Carthy’s book, ‘The Group’.” The in-
vitations were issued by Mr Newman
Rosenthal, head of the Audio-Visual
Aids Department at Melbourne Uni-
versity. The meeting was to be chaired
by Professor Hector Munro, who holds
the Chair of Philosophy at Monash
University.
Earlier, when Professor Munro and
Mr Rosenthal made it known that they
intended to fight the State Government
over “The Group” case, both found
themselves inundated with offers of help.
Mr Rosenthal estimates that at least 100
people approached him, personally, or
by letter or phone, with offers of assist-
ance. One letter he received was signed
by 26 masters at Melbourne Boys’ High
School, all offering their help. Many
letters included donations, sometimes a
fiver, sometimes a few guineas. There
were some who apologised for not being
able to send more like the young
schoolteacher who sent a pound, and
the gentleman who wrote from a home
for retired Jewish people, sending ss.
Many of the volunteers had ideas for
fighting the ban. Some offered to sell
the book publicly in the streets to force
a test case. Others suggested finding a
bookseller who was prepared to “break
the law” in order to make a test case.
One writer wanted to organise an
exhibition of books banned in various
countries down through the ages. As
he pointed out, most such books were
now readily available, and the exhibition
could be organised cheaply. Neither Pro-
fessor Munro nor Mr Rosenthal were
prepared to prejudge the various tactics
suggested; this was a question to be
decided by the meeting they were con-
vening.
Some of those concerned at the
growth of book-banning in Victoria are
convinced that there is some behind-
the-scenes collusion between Customs
officials and the Victorian Police. At
one time, Customs officials were in a
position to initiate bans, but the reforms
introduced by Senator Henty have
deprived minor officialdom of the oppor-
tunity to indulge themselves in this way.
These frustrated book-burners, so the
argument runs, now satisfy their zeal by
prodding the police into action whenever
they get the chance.
Undoubtedly the most insidious
feature of the Victorian system is its
sly, unofficial nature. A policeman
warns a bookseller and the latter
hurriedly gets rid of the offending works.
How many books have disappeared by
this method, or been removed from
shelves in anticipation of trouble, nobody
knows.
Mr Rosenthal, who had assailed the
Victorian system of bans and censor-
ship in a newspaper article the previous
week, commented to The Bulletin:
“The booksellers have told me they are
absolutely terrified that was the word
used to me yesterday.”
It is not often that a Rabbi addresses
his congregation on book banning—but
that is what Rabbi Sanger did in Temple
Beth Israel last Saturday after the ban
on “The Group” became known.
Both by his performance in Parlia-
ment and in TV interviews the Attorney-
General, Mr A. Rylah, has come out of
the present controversy very badly.
Before it is through he seems certain
to have to defend his action in a court
of law.
BUSINESS
The Rugged
Explorers?
Shaking up the oil industry
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
A lthough paying for oil imports is no
worry at the moment with overseas
reserves topping £.828 million at the
latest count, looking to the future, oil
search had become an even more press-
ing business after last week’s news that
crude oil imports rose by 100.000 tons,
or by 8 p.c., last year. Going on that
rate of increase and, without counting
in further discoveries of crude oil here,
imports would double in nine years and
cost about £3OO million.
While the Minister for Mines in
Queensland was saying that one of the
international oil companies operating
here was trying to throw an economic
cover over the development of indige-
nous oil resources by intransigence on
the Moonie oil price question, that was
not the mood of the Australian Petro-
leum Exploration Association meeting in
Melbourne last week nor seemingly
of Sir William Spooner, the Minister for
National Development, who addressed
it. Their emphasis was not only that
oil search be stepped up but also that
the nation grasp the power possibilities
in the accumulating new discoveries of
natural gas.
Sir William said what everybody else
was thinking, that it was high time in-
terests with widespread oil search tene-
ments should either do more themselves
in exploring their areas or let in others,
by farm-outs or otherwise, to ensure more
intensive exploration and to speed dis-
covery. “In some cases the large tene-
ments held tend to limit the amount of
exploration,” Sir William stated, “and
I believe those holding these large tene-
ments would do well to think more of
making farm-out arrangements. This is
a matter within the province of the
State Governments and the Northern
Territory Adminstration, but I think
public opinion will create an atmos-
phere as further discoveries are made
which will make it difficult for large
tenements to continue unless there is an
adequate exploration programme.” In
this observation the Minister was as-
suredly pointing the bone at WAPET,
which has most of the sedimentary
basins in Western Australia under per-
mit. But WAPET has already indicated
its intention to let a few others into its
far-flung tenement empire.
Except in saying that “I have in mind
the need for greater encouragement for


wild-cat drilling,” Sir William unfortu-
nately said nothing to whet the explor-
ers’ appetites on the score of raising
Federal oil search subsidies. Of course,
as Mr Eric Avery, Vice-Chairman of
the Association, commented: “Sir Wil-
liam told us of the modification sub-
sidy, especially the footage formula and
I doubt if many of us will grumble at
the demise of something which never-
theless has been effective in getting a lot
of holes drilled quickly and efficiently.
But if anyone has succeeded in beating
the 30 p.c. maximum subsidy on one
well, this has only meant that he has
probably been able to drill four wells
instead of three on a cost subsidy basis.”
Clearly the Association wants more than
that and won’t rest until the 50 p.c.
subsidy per well is restored.
It was left to geologist, Mr R. C.
Sprigg, Chairman of APEA, to point to
what seem to be the consequences of the
inadequacies of the Commonwealth's
subsidy policy in saying that consider-
able idle time and unhealthy price cut-
ting plague the drilling industry. He
instanced “the failure of geological and
geophysical exploration to get safely
ahead of the drill.” “While,” he stated,
“there are still far too few adequately
defined targets laid out for the drill,
numerous large sedimentary basins or
portions of such basins remain almost
entirely unprobed.”
Even so, the explorers appear to be
just a little sensitive of the Govern-
ment’s hand in their business. Sir Wil-
liam Spooner got this reply from Mr
Avery on remarking that the task is
primarily one for private enterprise.
(Of the £23 million spent last year the
Government found about £6 million or
26 p.c.) “I would guess,” jibed Avery,
“that true to their character, rugged
private enterprise, whom I am address-
ing, will try to ensure that the 26 p.c.
does not wag 74 p.c. of dog.”

THE ALP
Two Labor
Foreign Policies?
Dr Cairns v. Mr Beazley
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
DR. CAIRNS
Influential
James Cairns is now a very im-
portant and influential man in the
Labor Party. He was one of the first
elected to the Federal Parliamentary
Labor Party Executive. At 48, he is
being pushed hard as a potential and
brilliant successor to Mr Arthur Cal-
well as Federal Labor Leader.
For these reasons his speech on inter-
national affairs last week in the House of
Representatives merits attention. It
merits attention for other reasons also.
In my view Cairns’ speech:
• When compared with that made by
Kim Beazley (Labor, WA) in the same
debate points up the basic division in
Labor’s ranks on foreign policy;
• Is another illustration of how words,
as such, no longer have any real mean-
ing in the Labor Party; and
• Shows the penchant of some Labor
men for being more merciless critics of
social shortcomings in non-Communist
countries than of social shortcomings in
countries with Communist governments.
Both Cairns’ and Beazley’s speeches
were critical of the Menzies Govern-
ment’s foreign policy. If anything
Beazley’s was more forcibly condem-
natory than Cairns’. But Beazley spoke
within a framework similar to that within
which the Government was operating.
Beazley argued that the key to
Western policy everywhere was the con-
tainment of Communism. What he did
not like was the way the Government
was going about that containment. He
made no bones about where he stood.
He said military obligations ought to be
undertaken by Australia in Asia. Aus-
tralia’s goals in South-East Asia, must
be first military security and second to
prove that Australia respects and cares
for the future of the people of South-
East Asia.
Recalling Chinese genocide in Tibet,
he accused the Menzies Government of
being “a major factor in sustaining Com-
munism in China” by allowing the export
of 5,000,000 tons of wheat to that
country. “The Government’s attitude
towards Red China is that we will have
money and other people will have
death,” he said.
Cairns’ speech was a fascinating con-
trast.
He spoke of Red China’s “aggression”
but left it undefined. He was most
laudatory over the patience China had
displayed over Formosa. “What other
great power in the world would accept
the occupancy (by another and rival
power) of islands three to five miles off
her coast?” he asked. But in pleading
for diplomatic recognition of Red China
he, himself, suggested the reason other
than Red China’s monumental patience
why islands three to five miles off main-
land China are still occupied by Formosa.
Recognition of Red China would not
mean that Formosa would be “sold out”
he said. The United States—and others
would approve “the continuance of
the cordon around Formosa to prevent
any invasion or interference with that
country”. In other words it was not
Red China’s patience that was responsible
for its forbearance towards Formosa.
Having described China as a model
of patience and an aggressor Cairns then
proceeded to give a further example of
how words have ceased to have any real
meaning in the Labor Party.
According to Cairns a nuclear-free
Southern Hemisphere does not mean a
nuclear free Southern Hemisphere.
Giving the words their plain meaning
was “a deliberate distortion" originated

by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert
Menzies, and carried on by his “fawning
supporters” ever since.
Amusingly this puts ALP strong man
Mr F. E. Chamberlain, for years the
official interpreter of ALP policy, in the
position of being one of Menzies’
“fawning supporters”.
At page six of the official report
(printed, issued and authorised by the
ALP) of the special ALP conference held
in Canberra in March, 1963, to deal with
foreign affairs and defence appears the
following:—
“Opinions had (now) been expressed
that the Nuclear Free Zone Document
in its present form was completely
defensible and that we (the ALP) could
agree to a base being established without
in any way offending against the Nuclear
Free Zone statement. The secretary, Mr
Chamberlain, said that he did not agree
with these opinions.”
But Cairns goes even further than in
effect dubbing Chamberlain one of
Menzies’ “fawning supporters”. His new
interpretation of a nuclear-free zone
would, if the policy had been adopted
originally, have been a sensible one. In
essence it says let us not declare the
Southern Hemisphere a nuclear-free
zone. Let us do something quite dif-
ferent. Let us leave the nuclear situation
untouched as far as the great powers—
Russia and the United States—are con-
cerned. But let us minimise the nuclear
risk by seeking to restrict manufacture
and possession of nuclear weapons to the
great powers.
Page 15 of the report of the con-
ference at which Chamberlain made his
pronouncements discloses that the
nuclear-free Southern Hemisphere was
not to be merely an act of renunciation
on the part of the small countries, as
Cairns claimed in the Parliament last
week. The Antarctic Treaty powers
were to be included in that act of re-
nunciation. Both the United States and
the Soviet are Antarctic Treaty countries.
Illustrating the habit of some Labor
men to be more critical of the social
defects of non-Communist countries
than of Communist countries, Cairns in
his last week’s speech complained about
the fact that Formosan authorities had
arrested members of the political opposi-
tion. Quite properly he was scathing
about this. Authoritarianism is still
authoritarianism in any guise.
Sir Wilfred Kent Hughes (Liberal,
Vic.) by interjection suggested that
things might be even worse in Peking
where there is evidence to suggest that
oppositionists not only get arrested but
shot.
Even though last Thursday’s inter-
national affairs debate was a one-day
affair, it was still long enough to show
that divisions in Labor’s ranks on foreign
policy are at once significant and lasting.
THE COMMUNIST PARTY
Over the Hill
Preparing to bury the Moscow-liners
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
TED HILL
“Master tactician”
T>oth Laurie Aarons’s Muscovites and
Ted Hill’s Pekingese are having
their successes and disappointments in
their attempts to rally support before
the Communist Party of Australia’s
National Congress due to be held in
June.
A major victory for Hill, which has
gone almost unnoticed, was the defec-
tion of John Nolan, a youthful and
popular member of the Queensland
State Committee. At a meeting of the
Committee at the end of February,
Nolan moved a pro-China motion.
When it was rejected he promptly re-
signed and left for Melbourne to consult
with Hill.
Nolan is only one of many who have
been lying low in the Communist Party.
As a State Committee member who was
trained overseas he went to the
Soviet Union and China in 1957-58
he is a big fish. But to Hill, the landing
of Nolan is only a prelude to more in-
tensive fishing in the troubled waters
of the Communist Party and its most
valuable ‘’front” organisation, the Aus-
tralia-China Society.
Hill recently sent to Sydney one of
his most loyal followers, Harry Booley,
who not so long ago was employed by
the Australia-Soviet Friendship Society.
Booley has acted as Hill's emissary be-
fore; his two visits to China last year
bear witness to this. It is significant
that since his visit, Hill's supporters in
the Australia-China Society have come
out more openly in their pro-Peking
statements. A takeover of the NSW
branch of the Society by the Hill group
would not be surprising.
Hill has been active in other direc-
tions. Mrs Doreen Lorbach, a former
Victorian organiser of the Liquor
Trades Union and a staunch Hillite, has
been posted to China in a permanent
liaison capacity, a position formerly held
by a CPA member.
The battle for the Bendigo (Vic.)
bookshop has turned out to be a blood-
less victory for Hill. Elsie Sydes, a
long-standing and trusted CPA member,
had the lease of the Party bookshop
at Bendigo in her name. When she
recently joined Hill's group she brought
the bookshop with her.
Wharfie Syd Clare is also stepping up
the activities of the Hill group in Syd-
ney. Originally numbering only 40, its
figures are increasing rapidly. Clare is
working hard to build a group to run
for office this year in the Sydney branch
of the Waterside Workers’ Federation.
Important, too, are the number and
status of Hill supporters visiting China
at the invitation of the Chinese Com-
munist Party. Besides Booley, veteran
Communist campaigner from Mel-
bourne Dr Gerry O'Day and Mrs Rose
Johnson, wife of the former State Pre-
sident of the Victorian Branch of the
CPA, have been in China recently. On
March 19 Clarrie O'Shea, Secretary of
the Victorian Tramways Union and
former State Committee member of the
CPA, left for Peking.
When Dr O'Day and Mrs. Johnson
were in China, the leader of the New
Zealand Communist Party a pro-
Peking party Vic Wilcox, was also
visiting there. On his way home from
China, Wilcox spent twenty-four hours
in Sydney, during which time he held
secret talks. But the participants in
these talks are said to be so surprising
that even Laurie Aarons would be
shocked to learn of their identity.
Distrust and suspicion are now the
watchwords in the CPA. The Aarons
brothers are reported to be in constant
session with Disputes (Control) Commit-
tee chairman Jack Hughes.
Prime suspect of the movement is
Seamen’s Union Secretary E. V. Elliott
who makes frequent trips to Melbourne
on union business. Present opinion is
that, at the worst, he confers with Hill;
at the best, he is sitting on the fence.
In the past, Hill was a particular friend
of Elliott and often appeared in
court as advocate for the Seamen's
Union. Elliott's last trip to Melbourne
happened to coincide with Wilcox's
visit there.
In view of these developments, Laurie
Aarons may well fear that Nolan's de-
fection to Hill will be the forerunner of
many others. At the moment the ball is
with Hill, who fancies himself as the
master tactician.


THE SENATE
The End of WA’s Country Party?
Liberal revenge for the CP deal with Labor
FROM A WA CORRESPONDENT
HPhose who believe the Country Party-
Labor Party deal in the WA seats of
Forrest, Canning and Moore has passed
into history as just another party
manoeuvre during the 1963 Federal elec-
tion are due for a rude awakening. It
is more than possible* that the whole
matter will be reopened during the
Senate election which must take place
before June 30, 1965.
The alleged architect of the “1963
Deal”, Senator T. C. Drake-Brockman,
is the Country Party Senator who must
next face the electors. So far he has
never denied the Liberals’ allegations
regarding his part in the deal and he
cannot be so naive as to believe that his
election can come and go without some
pretty ruthless examination by the
Liberals.
Unfortunately for the Senator, irre-
spective of the allegations made against
him, the plain fact, as shown by the
voting figures, is that his chances of re-
election are not so good. And, indeed,
as time goes on, could get worse with
each succeeding election.
In 1955, the first election in which the
Liberals and the Country Party ran
separate Senate teams, a Senator needed
a quota of 48,859 votes. Senator Agnes
Robertson, who, sacked by the Liberal
Party, had joined the Country Party,
polled the necessary quota on the pri-
maries.
However, with the increase in the
population of Western Australia the
quota rose to 52,062 in 1958, 54,696
in 1961, and may well be anticipated to
be not less than 57,000 in 1964-65.
Coupled with the rise in the Senate
quota has been the dramatic fall in the
Country Party primary votes. This has
been to such an extent that at the 1963
poll the three Country Party candidates
Hallett, Maisey, and Oates —• could
muster only some 27,000 primary votes.
What must have been more disturbing
to the Country Party, in each electorate
Liberals topped the poll in the primaries.
Making due allowance for Country
Party voters retired and resident in the
metropolitan area, and the small CP
vote in the Kalgoorlie electorate, it is
hard to see how Senator Drake-Brockman
is going to poll anywhere near a quota
especially in view of what the Liber-
als think of the reaction of the anti-
Labor, County Party supporter will be
if there is sufficient publicity given to
the “1963 Deal ’.
The question already being asked in
WA is whether the signs portend the
elimination of the Country Party from
the Senate, State by State. This cer-
tainly will happen if the Liberals refuse
to give the Country Party number two
place in a joint-team. Left to run
alone the Country Party would eventu-
ally be displaced by the Liberal Party
in the Senate.
Inquiring Liberal eyes in WA are
wondering if the Country Party is pre-
paring to face such a crisis. Suggestions
are being made by political observers
that in the attempt to return Senator
Drake-Brockman to Canberra the CP
will come to some arrangement with
Labor.
It would be ironical if the long-term
result of the alleged Country Party-
Labor “Deal” resulted in the CP no
longer being able to poll a Senate quota
in WA and only continue to hold Can-
ning and Moore through arrangements
with Labor or by a gerrymander.
What happens in the WA Senate elec-
tion, and what happens over redistribu-
tion in the House of Representatives,
could well be a guide as to whether or
not the Country Party will be left as a
force in Canberra.
GAMBLING
The High Rollers
“There’s no such thing as a fair game in Darw in"
FROM PETER BLAKE IN THE NORTHERN TERRITORY
HPiiRRiTORiANS are patient people;
they’ve got to be or they would go
“troppo” with frustration. A case in
point is the legislation passed at the
recent sitting of the NT Legislative
Council.
It is a bill to amend the Lotteries and
Gaming Ordinance to allow off-course
betting shops to be set up in the Terri-
tory. It is a gamble on the part of elec-
ted members that paid off after nearly 14
years.
The legislation had a stormy passage
in that time. Three times it passed the
House but the Government vetoed it in
Canberra. It was one of the issues which
led to the famous “walkout” by elected
members four years ago and indirectly
to minor constitutional reforms.
Last year the Government sent the
Bill back with suggested minor amend-
ments, and it was in that form that the
House passed it for the fourth time.
Under the Bill, Administration will set
up a three-man Betting Control Board
with wide powers. The Board will
license betting shops (on a population
basis with a minimum of two) through-
out the Territory.
Outside Darwin and Alice Springs,
which have weekly race meetings, the
shops will be open for business for
Saturday as well as mid-week races. In
Darwin and Alice they will have to
close at noon on days when there is a
local race meeting.
They will be operating in fertile coun-
try, as Territorians are keen on a punt,
especially in the centres down the track
which have to take pretty cramped SP
odds at present. The really big betting-
shop business will be done in Katherine
and Tennant Creek and there is sure to
be a scramble for licences.
Flush meatworkers from Katherine
and miners from Tennant will ensure
a steady flow of cash in the coffers of the
betting shops. They won't be such a
good proposition in Darwin where there
is a strong and active betting ring at
the Fannie Bay races, and a service for
punters unrivalled on any course in Aus-
tralia.
Nobody bets much on the two or three
Darwin races a day, unless he has a horse
running or likes an “outsider’’ at even
money. The bookies are very wary of
the locals and are loath to bet on them
at all. It is not uncommon in a three-
horse race to see odds of 5/1 on, 3/1
on and even money, which takes some
of the zest out of betting.
But from three metropolitan courses
(Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide)
there is a prices service with a complete
call of the board at least twice for each
race, plus up-to-the-minute fluctuations
and a broadcast of each race.
In other fields of speculation Darwin
is extremely well catered for with a
number of exotic and mostly floating
card games. There is kabu for the
smaller gamblers, a pontoon-like game
rarely played in the same place two

weeks running yet the word passes
around in a mysterious bush telegraph
manner and prospective players never
have any difficulty getting there.
For the big money men there is the
game played with domino-like pieces
and with a particular fascination for
Darwin’s free-betting Greek and Chinese
gamblers. It is not uncommon for
£20,000 to change hands when the heavy
money is there.
Others fancy sa-lang (stud) or la (a
sort of 13-card poker). Raids are rare
because the games are very hard to find.
They are hard to find because, unless
you are known, you can’t get within
coo-ee of the dealer. Police know
about one big game going at the moment
but how to get at it has them buffaloed.
It is played at such an inaccessible spot
that they would have as much chance of
surprising it as a buffalo would have of
walking a tightrope.
Strangely enough the national game is
almost unknown on a large scale. It is
probably because swy has little appeal
to the migrants and Chinese who are
Darwin’s high rollers.
In Darwin they play their cards very
close to their chest, and with a good
reason. One professional gambler who
has tried to beat the odds in most
cities of the world said: “Up here if they
can get away with it, there’s no such
thing as a fair game. The ordinary rules
don’t apply”. He modestly declined to
be named on the grounds that it might
bring him some odium around the big
schools.
TASMANIA
Rivals for
the Empress?
The ferry again
FROM A HOBART CORRESPONDENT
!Tobart shipping and business interests
convinced themselves that the
Empress of Australia was the Sydney-
to-Hobart ferry. But in Northern Tas-
mania they believed from the outset that
the vessel would have terminals at Bell
Bay, one of Launceston’s deep-water
ports.
Cornered by angry Hobart leaders
who insisted that the Commonwealth
Government and the Australian National
Line had gone back on their word, the
new Minister for Shipping, Mr Freeth,
revealed a hitherto well-kept depart-
mental secret. The ferry, he said flatly,
had originally been planned to run
between Sydney and Bell Bay only, but
Hobart and Burnie had later come into
the ANL thinking.
The change occurred when the Union
Steamship Co., long associated with the
Hobart-mainland trade, decided to build
two roll-on, roll-off cargo ferries for the
run. The ANL, aware that about 80
per cent of their vessel’s revenue
would come from cargo, realised that
Hobart tonnages would necessarily be
shared with the USC, and began to
think in terms of additional runs to
Bell Bay and Burnie, where ferry ter-
minals are in existence and big, regular
cargoes for Sydney are offering.
Hobart interests are deeply con-
cerned with the passenger traffic and
the prestige associated with the Empress.
They took fright and forced the issue
into the open on Federal election eve.
Now they are disappointed and hurt.

Ninety per cent

FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
Qome very fancy amounts are being
bandied about as to the price paid by
the US firm, Ted Bates and Company,
to buy a majority control of Australia’s
biggest advertising agency, George
Patterson Pty Ltd. Rival advertising
executives are gossiping about £1 million
and envy the more than handsome
capital profits falling into the laps of
Patterson’s staff shareholders.
A number of these happy few may
feel content with their gains, but large
sums are likely to find their way back
into the new business, since American
agencies tend to encourage this kind of
interest among senior employees.
Professionally, Patterson’s must be
rated high up with the leaders, both in
Australia and overseas, although it’s
a common opinion among advertising
men that 90 per cent of the new ideas
in most agencies seem derived from
America.
Is American domination of three out
of the four top Australian agencies an-
other example of lack of local origin-
ality? The surviving independent, Jackson
Wain and Company, denies this firmly.
Mr John Jackson, of Jackson Wain,
does not regard the process as inevitable,
either from a technical or financial
standpoint. He should know, since Jack-
son Wain has turned down several
American and British advances. These
have not been just nibbles at an attractive
Australian prospect.
Pattersons has already taken a run-
ning jump into Asia through a sizeable
holding in Cathay Agency, of Hong
Kong, Singapore and Bangkok. The
Bates’ alliance joins it to an agency
active in England, Canada, France, Ger-
may, Italy and Spain.

A Modern Passion Play?
The Vatican and the Jews -an examination
By ISI LEIBLER
ON November 17, 1962, Rolf Hoch-
huth, an unknown young German,
was awarded the coveted Gerhart
Hauptmann Prize for the best German
play of 1962. The same play later won
him the 1963 “Young Generation Play-
wright Award” of the Berliner Kunstpreis.
In brief, Hochhuth’s drama focuses on
Pope Pius XII (“The Representative”)*
and condemns the Pontiff for alleged
passivity and quiescence in the face of
Hitler’s mass slaughter of European
Jewry. It was of course inevitable that
the theatrical dramatisation of such a
theme involved over-simplification of
great and complex issues. For these
reasons, “The Representative” was
immediately regarded as a political event
rather than a stage play. Within a short
span of time the play had been translated
into all the major European languages
and became a world-wide best-seller. It
also aroused tremendous passions.
Hochhuth was only eleven years old
(and in fact a member of the Hitler
±We will shortly publish a Roman
Catholic commentary on “The Represen-
tative”.
•“THE REPRESENTATIVE”, by Rolf Hoch-
huth, translated by R. D. MacDonald and
published by Methuen & Co. Ltd, London,
Jugend) when the events dealt with in
the play took place. He therefore gained
his background material from books
rather than experience.
Being a German and a Protestant,
Hochhuth was immediately accused of
trying consciously, or subconsciously, to
find partners, outside the German people,
in the “great guilt”. There may be some
truth in such allegations, but Hochhuth
does not spare words in condemnation
of the German people collectively. He
states that “the fact that today we can
tour Auschwitz as we tour the Colosseum
does not make it any less difficult to
believe that only seventeen years ago, in
our own world of reality, this gigantic
factory, with full railroad facilities, was
operated by ordinary human beings for
the purpose of killing other human
beings, and that these same people are
today earning their bread as letter
carriers, judges, doctors, salesmen, pen-
sioners, Secretaries of State, and obste-
tricians”.
Throughout the play, Hochhuth high-
lights the builders, managers, and other
profiteers of the death factories—“the
captains of industry like Krupps, who
converted human blood into gold for
their treasuries”. There are also re-
ferences to scientists like Professor
August Hirst, the “collector of human
skulls”, and Adolf Eichmann, the most
zealous functionary in the Nazi enter-
prise of death”.
One of the chief characters is an anti-
Nazi Storm Trooper—Kurt Gerstein—
who tries to influence the Nuncio to take
drastic action to save the Jews. Gerstein
is one of the characters modelled on an
historical figure. Yet Hochhuth’s Gerstein
states categorically that “the Germans
must bear the chief guilt”.
Despite this, in a penetrating review
in the journal “Midstream”, Michael
Harrington contends that Hochhuth’s
drama has all the banal conscripted doers
of evil on one side (the average Nazi
bureaucrats); the satanic figure of the
evil Doctor in the middle; and on the far
side, the Pope who is cursed with the
gift of choice. Harrington maintains
that although Hochhuth concedes Nazi
guilt as the primary cause of the exter-
mination of the Jews, in terms of the
dramatic and emotional impact of the
play, most of the Nazis are seen as fated
to do evil, while the Pope is made to
choose it.
In this regard it is significant that in
the shortened stage version of the play
performed in Germany, the 120 pages
deleted virtually all deal with the role
of the Germans and Nazism.
Another critique implying that the
play is primarily a cleverly constructed
piece of anti-Catholicism, is also a gross
over-simplification. After all, the chief
character and hero of the play is a
Catholic the saintly selfless Jesuit
Father Riccardo Fontano. After failing
to persuade his spiritual superiors to act,
Father Fontano dramatically pins the
Star of David on his soutane and leaves
the Papal Palace. From there he joins
a batch of Jews being deported to Ausch-
witz. In the horrifying final act, in which
he ultimately perishes, Father Fontano’s
faith is challenged by the satanic Nazi
prison doctor. Even here he stops short
of finally condemning the Pope—“ Let us
not be his judges”.
“Objectionable”
Vet Hochhuth clearly insists that Pope
Pius XII the Representative of
Christ on Earth —did fail in his duty to
the Jews, to humanity, and to God.
Father Fontano expresses Hochhuth’s
conclusion when he is made to exclaim
“A Vicar of Christ who knows all that
(is taking place) and still keeps quiet for
mere reasons of State; a Vicar who even
hesitates a single day is a criminal”. On
one occasion Hochhuth even goes so far
as to imply that the Pope sacrificed the
Jews in order to safeguard the financial
interests (“the Hungarian stocks”) of the
Vatican. Apart from being manifestly
untrue and objectionable, “dramatic”

passages such as these tend to compro-
mise the central issue raised in the play.
No serious observer can suggest that
Pope Pius was indifferent to Jewish
suffering. The absurdity of such imputa-
tions can be seen by the tributes Jewish
organisations paid the Pope after the
war, for the Vatican wartime succor
given to thousands of individual Jews.
It must also be remembered that prior
to becoming Pope Pius XII, Cardinal
Pacelli, as Vatican Secretary of State,
was the man primarily responsible for
drafting Papal anti-Nazi statements such
as “Mit Brennender Sorge” issued in the
name of Pius XI. Cardinal Pacelli and
Pope Pius XII were one and the same
man. Perhaps Pacelli was a better
Secretary of State than a Pope. But to
accuse him of sheer indifference to
Jewish suffering under the Nazis is quite
unjustified.
And yet the question must be asked,
why did the Pope remain silent whilst
God’s children were dying a thousand
terrible deaths before his eyes? Knowing
all the facts, why did the Pope limit
Vatican protest to the extermination of
European Jewry merely to an ambiguous
general statement, not even specifically
mentioning Jews? Why did he not cry
out and appeal to the thirty-five million
Catholics in Germany? Why did he not
tell the Catholics in Lithuania, Latvia,
and Poland not to collaborate with the
Nazis in their extermination drive? Did
not the excommunication of active Com-
munists prove that Pius XII could act
with decisiveness in the political field?
Had not Pope Pius protested bitterly to
President Roosevelt when American
bombers raided targets over Italy?
60 notes
HThe Pope did protest when specifically
Catholic issues were involved as is
testified by over 60 notes between the
Vatican and the German Government
referring to violations of treaties be-
tween 1933 and 1944. These included
protests against the dissolution of Catho-
lic schools, impediments to religious
freedom, against the absolute oath to
the Fuhrer, against the sterilisation and
subsequent killing of the insane, and
against the imprisonment of priests,
monks and nuns 3500 of whom
had been thrown into Dachau. But
there was no single protest condemning
or protesting at the “Final Solution”.
Hochhuth bitterly rejects interpreta-
tions implying that the necessity to main-
tain neutrality at any cost was the reason
why no threat of excommunication was
even utilised. “What had Hitler’s
measures for the annihilation of one
entire race in Europe to do with the Sec-
ond World War? Are Auschwitz or the
gigantic mass graves of murdered civilians
theatres of war? . . . The ‘Final Solu-
tion’, like the euthanasia programme, is
not to be treated as the passing trans-
gression of a warring power. No greater
spur can be given to a legend in favor
of Hitler than to regard this plan to gas
an entire race, and the crimes connected
of necessity with this plan, as being
within the framework of the general
conduct of the war.”
Hochhuth maintains that one of the
main factors restraining the Pope from
an outright break with Hitler was his
desire to see a weakened and obedient
Hitler in power, rather than a conquering
Stalin. Such a theory must remain a
matter of sheer historical speculation.
But it should be borne in mind that at
the peak of “appeasement” when it was
fashionable for Western statesmen to
appeal for “restraint” in dealing with
Hitler “the bulwark against Bolshe-
vism”— Cardinal Pacelli courageously
drafted “Mit Brennender Sorge”. Nor
were the repeated attempts by the Vati-
can to extricate Italy from the war the
acts of one desiring to strengthen the
“Axis”.
Yet there is no doubt that today,
armed with the benefit of historical hind-
even many Catholics feel that the
Pope should have spoken out.
Still others, including many who were
intimately connected with the Pope,
point out that the Pope had in fact little
choice other than to act as he did. He had
to choose the lesser of two evils. For
had he spoken out, he might well have
sent thousands upon thousands of people
to their deaths. The experience in
Holland had been that immediately
following a statement issued by the Dutch
bishops attacking the deportation of
Jews, the Nazis reacted by also deporting
Catholic converts of “non - Aryan”
descent.
In one of his last acts as Cardinal
Montini, the present Pope forcefully
stated this viewpoint: “Let us suppose
that Pius XII had done what Hochhuth
blames him for not doing. His actions
would have led to such reprisals and
devastation that Hochhuth himself, the
war being over, would have been able
to write another play ... a play, that is,
about the ‘Representative’ who through
political exhibitionism or psychological
myopia would have been guilty of un-
leashing on the already tormented world
still greater calamities.’’
Apologists for Pius also point out that
the additional victims would in no way
have minimised the suffering of the Jews.
Not even Hochhuth goes so far as to
claim with certainty that an intervention
by the Pope would have saved thousands
of lives.
“A matter of taste”
Tn fairness, when judging Pius, one
A would do well to take account of
the role of other Western leaders. After
all, Hitler could have been stopped in
the early 19305. But this was the period
of “appeasement” when the Western
Powers were conducting a Machiavel-
lian policy designed to play Hitler up
against Stalin. The two dictators had
the last laugh by concluding the notori-
ous Nazi-Soviet Pact with its disastrous
consequences. Yet had Hitler’s early
insane Judenrein exhortations been dealt
with firmly, the “Final Solution” might
never have been put into practice.
One should also remember that in
1939, when Stalin telegraphed Hitler that
“the agreement between the USSR and
the German Republic was sealed in
blood”, our Soviet allies-to-be had a
bizarre partnership with the Nazis and
were handing over to the Gestapo wanted
anti-Nazis (including Jews) from the
Soviet Union, where they had been given
political asylum. This was at a time
when Molotov stated that Nazism was
merely “a matter of taste”.
Nor is the role of the British Govern-
ment beyond reproach. The imposition
of the White Paper in Palestine had the
result of denying a haven to hundreds of
thousands of stateless Jews who might
otherwise have escaped the gas chambers.
In some cases ships, crammed with refu-
gees, turned away from Haifa, struck
mines and all perished.
The discussions relating to the Jews
that allegedly took place between Roose-
velt and Stalin at Potsdam and Yalta
also hardly reflect to the credit of the
leaders of the Western Alliance.
Even non-governmental bodies like the
International Red Cross had their reasons
for not denouncing the Nazi extermina-
tion programme. Count Bernadotte feared
that such denunciations might provoke
the Nazis into rejecting the Geneva Con-
vention and thus “jeopardising the
humane activities of the Red Cross”.
Granting that Pius shared what some
describe as his “error in judgment”
with most Western leaders, and accepting
the Pope’s sincerity and good intentions,
one is still tempted to speculate that
neutrality and diplomatic immunity
appear to have become somewhat of an

obsession with him. For it is most un-
likely that the successors of Pius XII
(or for that matter his predecessor), even
taking account of all the circumstances,
would have remained silent. But then
the Catholic Church has undergone con-
siderable transformation over the last
thirty years which is reflected in its
current ecumenical movement and over-
all heightened social consciousness.
The noted Catholic scholar Francois
Mauriac is probably echoing the senti-
ments of many Catholics when he states
that “the silence of the Pope and Cardi-
nals was a most terrible duty; the import-
ant thing being to avoid even worse mis-
fortunes. Nevertheless a crime of such
magnitude falls in no small measure to
the responsibility of all those witnesses
who never cried out against it—whatever
the reason for their silence.”
Hochhuth’s play, divested of its sen-
sationalism and distortions, highlights the
role of passivity in the face of evil. One
is tempted to conclude that the course
of Pius XII in not speaking up openly
and boldly against genocide was wrong.
That he shared this error with most other
European leaders is undeniable. But his
reasons for remaining silent, no matter
how wrong, are neither sinister nor
Machiavellian, as Hochhuth’s dramatic
presentation implied. In fact, it must be
recognised that the value of the play as
a moral drama is compromised by the in-
jection of vulgarisms and distortions re-
flecting Hochhuth’s prejudices.
Breaking the ice
'J'he question that should not be asked
by non-Catholics who do not recog-
nise the Pope as God’s representative on
Earth is “Should not the Vicar of
Christ have been expected to rise above
his contemporaries at a time of crisis
. . . ?” In the future such a question may
well be posed and answered by Catholics
assessing Pius XII as the Vicar of Christ.
It is Catholics, and Catholics alone, who
can grant Pius XII the verdict of history
as the “Representative”. Most non-
Catholics will probably conclude that, as
a human being entrusted with great
leadership responsibilities, the Pope
shared the failings of most European
leaders with regard to Nazism —the fault
of temporising, appeasing, and remaining
silent whilst a barbaric totalitarian regime
committed unspeakable crimes against
humanity.
There are some who feel that the
timing of Hochhuth’s play—raising the
delicate question it does—is most in-
opportune in view of the progress being
made at the present time between the
Jewish and Catholic communities. That
is a wrong approach. Understanding
between religious communities cannot be
realised at the expense of frankness.
Suppression invariably breeds suspicion
and bad feeling. Hochhuth, the Pro-
testant German, has produced a drama
which is not free of distortions. But a
restrained dialogue relating to the moral
question posed by Hochhuth can only
break the ice and pave the way for more
harmonious relations between Catholics,
Protestants, and Jews. The controversy
raised by Hochhuth can be all for the
good as long as it is not utilised by
sectarians and their like to promote anti-
Catholicism, and provided also that
Catholics do not “over-react” to in-
dividual acts of stupidity or malice. The
question of passivity in the face of evil
is worthy of serious discussion and
thought by all those concerned with the
moral standards to be adopted by leaders
in the “Open Society”.


OUT AND ABOUT
Getting in the Picture
Fashions in portraits -and portrait-painters
By CHARLES HIGHAM
Suppose you wake up one morning,
like the look of your face in the
bathroom mirror, and decide to
have it immortalised. By noon, the idea
becomes an obsession. By mid-after-
noon, office chores or household duties
brushed aside, you are busy making
enquiries. If you are well-to-do, the
names William Dobell, Ivor Hele or
William Dargie will probably be the first
to spring to mind. If you are not so
rich, you may more modestly contact
someone in the “middle range” of
painters those regularly accepted by
the Archibald, but not famous yet, and
charging somewhere between 100 and
300 guineas. You’re unlikely to get
the daub done cheaper, unless you know
one of the door-to-door painters who
may do it for as little as 50 guineas. So
far we haven’t anything like the Ameri-
can firm Portraits Incorporated, which
supplies limned likenesses pastel blurs
at specified measurements in return
for a submitted photograph and a fee.
The chances of getting Dobell to
paint you are very slight indeed, how-
ever rich you are. He’s apt to paint
only people he’s known for years, or
at least had the opportunity to observe
at close quarters. It he were persuaded
and the chances are he wouldn’t be
- the cost would be astronomical, pro-
bably well over 2000 guineas. This
isn’t nearly as much as some American
portraitists charge (20,000 dollars is not
an impossible fee in New York) but
it’s not chickenfeed. And Ivor Hele
and William Dargie, -both many times
Archibald winners and the doyens of
the country’s more conventional por-
traiture, ask up to 1500 guineas for a
portrait, according to dealers I’ve
spoken to. Failing these men, the
society women, businessmen, judges,
doctors and so on seized by the immor-
tality urge will go to people like
Harry Hanke, Bill Pidgeon, Joshua Smith,
Graeme Inson, Reshid Bey, Judy Cas-
sab, Shirley Bourne who will charge
anything up to 300 guineas and beyond
for their services.
Often a business firm wishing to pre-
serve a director’s likeness will go to a
dealer for advice. The dealer meets the
client, studies him carefully, and makes
a lightning analysis which would do
justice to a psychiatrist. How conser-
vative the man is, how much abstrac-
tion or inventiveness he will accept, how
literally he wants the background done,
for instance whether he will insist on
the chair he is sitting on and the cur-
tain or wall behind him being precisely
delineated, whether he will accept some
stylishness or strong personal flavor in
the portrait. In the case of a private
client, income and honesty with him-
self whether he will accept an un-
flattering work have to be deter-
mined. Finally, weighing income, con-
servativeness, intelligence, acquaintance
with art and half a dozen other factors
the dealer of necessity a shrewd
judge of character makes a decision
on what painter should do the job. He
will often give the client a number of
sample reproductions of the painter’s
work, and once approval has been
earned will arrange for painter and sit-
ter to meet. After that, he’ll collect a
percentage, which may go to as much as
33y per cent of the fee, and this makes
arranging for portraits a very good busi-
ness proposition.
The dealers are a fascinating breed.
The two I met John Brackenreg and
Rudy Komon of Sydney are perhaps
the most successful of their kind in the
country (a third man, Gordon Marsh of
the Gordon Galleries in Double Bay,
Sydney, proved notably publicity-shy and
postponed being interviewed until I
finally gave up). Both Brackenreg and
Komon deal in portraits, although the
former is more- active in the field.
Brackenreg and his assistant Dennis
Colsey make a most agreeable impres-
sion, with their immaculate Raymond
Chandlerish Gallery in, of all places,
the humdrum Sydney suburb of Artar-
mon. This gallery sends paintings all
over the world. Colsey mentioned
casually that a quarter million pounds
of paintings hung on the walls as he
arranged the trip wires for the burglar
alarm system, and both men and their
establishment exude an air of well-bred
opulence. Smoothly assured, they talk
about portraits with considerable enthu-
siasm, and believe portraiture is still
very much alive here as an art form.
But although portrait fees have risen
from an average top price of £6OO to
an average top price of £l5OO since
1939 they feel that the portrait business
has been in decline since that time.
“The reasons”, Brackenreg said, “are
the improvement of Australian art as a
whole and the emerging of photography
here.
“As people grow more used to ‘ad-
vanced’ paintings they see less and less
value in portrait paintings. This, of
course, is a pity.
“With the improvement of portrait
photography a businessman may well
prefer to order a huge photograph

Not surprisingly, Rudy Komon also
professed an admiration for portraits.
He said he felt out of sympathy with
the frequent attacks on portrait painting
in Australia. But he added the quali-
fication that a portrait must have “con-
temporary vitality” a genuine
modernity and be an analysis of
character, not merely a likeness. “Every
student can do a likeness. If he can’t
he has no business to take up a career
in art. Dobell, Drysdale, Molvig, Pugh
and a few others can convey character.
“But most are content with a photo-
graph. Dobell and the others I men-
tioned will only accept a commission
after they know a person. After they've
had a few drinks with the sitter in the
pub or dinner . . . take a cold com-
mission? No, of course they won’t do
that. These people paint not for money
—but for love of painting. Their sub-
jects give them inspiration . . .”
What of a man like William Dargie,
eight times Archibald winner? Does he
convey character? “No. I don’t want
to hurt him, but no. He is an acade-
mic painter. In the true sense. If you
look at his portraits they have the like-
ness of the person but not the character.
All those judges he paints they can’t
have the same character yet he paints
them the same. They are the same man
in his hands.
“They have the same flesh, the same
wig, the same eyes! But there must be
more under the wig!! More under the
eyes!”
And what of Ivor Hele? “Ah
well, he has more character. He touches
more of the person. Of course, with
Dobell it is different again. He goes
much deeper. I remember when I had
a little shop in Waverley. Dame Mary
Gilmore came to see Dobell’s picture of
her for the first time. She had a friend
with her. The friend did not like
the portrait. ‘lt’s bloody awful!’ she
said. But Mary told me, ‘Don’t take
any notice of her, my first impression
when I saw the portrait was I see
my father. They are the same eyes. If
I had wanted a likeness I would have
called a photographer.
“A portrait is of course a marvellous
thing if the painter sees deeply. An
artist has a much greater vision of peo-
ple than we normal people have”. Who
would Komon name as the most pene-
trating portraitist in Australia? “Jon
Molvig”, he replied.
Startlingly vivid
"l/ffosT of the people I spoke to seemed
agreed on that. Molvig is by no
means only a portraitist —he paints por-
traits only when he is excited or inspired
by a person’s face—but when he does a
likeness it is often startlingly vivid and
exact. Nancy Underhill, The Bulletin's
Brisbane art critic, sent a few com-
ments on this most distinguished of
Queensland painters:
“Reputably Peck's bad boy of
Queensland art, Molvig has recently had
a near miss at the Archibald after which
he was reported to have said that he
might eventually get it ‘on perseverance
alone’.
“His entry this year, a flashy study of
Joy Roggenkamp, was to many the
obvious winner. If this is the case it
seems certain that with a first-class work
he shouldn’t miss.
“Molvig feels very strongly that por-
traiture has been eclipsed in the rage
for ‘abstract’ painting and that the Aus-
tralian figurative painters may well start
a newer trend which will upgrade por-
traiture”.
Dobell, though according to both
Bernard Smith and Robert Hughes no
longer the artist he was, still commands
wide respect. A “Time” cover artist,
he is perhaps the onlv Australian port-
raitist to have become internationally
famous. Influenced by Rembrandt earW
on, he has always had a passion for
expressing a way of life which Br>an
Penton once described as “a whore wi f h
fat jowls and a mouth that sometimes
tries to smile”.
William Dargie is, of course, the aca-
demic painter par excellence , his income
often estimated as high as between
£7OOO and £lO,OOO a year. He has
published a book “On Painting a Por-
trait” in England and introductions to
the works of other painters. Bernard
Smith’s reference to him in “Australian
Painting” is acid and, I found, widely
echoed: “Dargie was the pupil of Archi-
bald Colquhoun, who had been the
pupil of Max Meldrum, who had been
in turn the pupil of Bernard Hall.
“It is quite surprising at first to think
of the number of Australian portrait

Mr. Hiller and his craft
The Importance of a Name. It’s important to realise that there
is such a person as Mr. Ernest Hiller the label that goes on to
his suits is not a “brand name” but his own personal signature.
It’s a guarantee that the suit has been tailored to Mr. Hiller’s
demanding standards (hand detailed where only hand work
will do); that the materials are of a superb quality.
The international styling of an Ernest Hiller suit is
undisputed as is the value-for-money that goes with
every suit that carries his name. From £25.19.6.

cream and brown patches; but it is the
levelling mode of portraiture which a
society deeply egalitarian in its sympa-
thies and prejudices seems to have found
curiously satisfying.”
Below Dargie, Dobell and Ivor Hele
in the portraitist echelon are several of
the middle rank in Melbourne Paul
Fitzgerald, and Louis Kahan, who caus-
ed a rumpus when he painted Patrick
White as what seemed to me The Crea-
ture from The Black Lagoon and
Robert Hughes as what I would call
The Picture of Dorian Gray, Last
Stage. A fellow Melburnian specialising
in society portraits is the exotic-sound-
ing Reshid Bey.
Other names that spring to mind are
Margaret Olley, Judy Cassab, Carring-
ton-Smith. There is Carleen Parker of
Sydney, who has painted the wives and
daughters of prominent men, and the
talented young painter Andrew Sibley,
who has done some portraits.
Sine qua non of many portraitists’
existence, the Archibald Prize must be
one of the most bitterly attacked com-
petitions on earth. Robert Hughes has
ruthlessly satirised it, and Bernard
Smith condemned it outright: “(It) is
the last stronghold of tonal illusionist
painting in the country; a sleek, flatter-
ing, oleaginous manner having been
favored by the Trustees . .
I visited Eric Langker, OBE, Presi-
dent of the Board of Trustees of the
Art Gallery of NSW and one of the
judges of the prize, to ask him about
the selection of the winner. “Between
125 and 150 paintings come in each
year”, he said. “On the first judging
day we look at the paintings.
“Immature work or work which
doesn’t fulfil the conditions of the will is
immediately written off. Then we each
go by ourselves to look at the pictures
and make a list of the best 10.
“Our selections are put in a ballot
box. The painting most often voted for
is the winner—there are no other prizes
or commendations.
“I myself often go back five times
before making a judgment. In my view
the Archibald has too many judges. I
would have preferred two artists and
a layman. We are frequently criticised
for using the Trustees as judges but
what people forget is that Archibald’s
will laid this down as a condition. We
couldn’t alter the conditions if we
wanted to.”
Was he against avant-garde painting?
“No. I like a great many of the
moderns”, he said.
Less conservative
'C'stablished by the will of J. F. Archi-
bald, first editor of The Bulletin,
the amount of the prize varies each year.
Lately, the judging has grown a trifle
less conservative. And the choice of
Dobell's painting of Joshua Smith in
1944 could almost be described as
daring, resulting as it did in one of the
oddest court cases in Australian history.
Two artists, Mary Edwards and David
Wolinsky, charged the Trustees with
having committed a breach of trust in
awarding the prize to a caricature not
a portrait. They asked the Gallery to
refrain from handing over the money
to Dobell.
Garfield Barwick for the plaintiffs
asked J. S. MacDonald, formerly direc-
tor of the Gallery, whether what Dobell
had painted was in fact a portrait of
the sitter. “No”, MacDonald, himself
a portraitist, replied. “What is it?” “I
think it is a pictorial defamation of
character”.
Dr V. Benjafield of Macquarie Street
said: “The portrait discloses the body
of a man who has been three months
dead”. Garfield Barwick, himself bril-
liantly painted by W. E. Pidgeon,
weighed into modern portraitists when
he asked a witness: “Although you have
not seen Picasso’s portrait of his father
as a pair of packing cases, if I had a
certain spiritual reaction to my mother-
in-law, could I paint her portrait as a
coil of barbed wire?” And on Modig-
liani’s famous self-portrait: “To call it
a portrait is to give violence to the Eng-
lish language”. The outcome of the
case was a judgment against Edwards
and Wolinski, who had to pay costs.
It’s hard to imagine anything like the
Dobell case occurring today. Apart
from the slight ripple caused by Louis
Kahan’s recent prizewinning portrait of
Patrick White, the public is on the
whole willing to accept a contemporary
and personal portrait from an artist, and
it may well not be far off before Jon
Molvig wins the Archibald. When that
happens, and when any other of the
advanced portraitists bent more on
painterly excellence and character ana-
lysis than on photographic precision
wins the prize, we may say that Austra-
lian portraiture has come officially of
age.

The South Will Not Secede
The live issues in the Riverina
By PATRICIA ROLFE
You can pass the word around in
Macquarie Street—the south will
not secede. Recent reports that
the people of the Riverina would either
turn themselves over to Victoria or set
up a separate state seem, on the evidence
of a recent tour, to be vastly exaggerated.
The only sign of a strong underground
movement was a conference on the
subject of a Riverina state at the new
Wagga Civic Theatre. But the Town
Clerk seemed more worried about
possible damage to his theatre than by
the thought that he might have to
organise a freedom march on Sydney.
The tour is the annual event organised
by the Royal Agricultural Society and
sponsored by the Shell Oil Company in
each State. In NSW it is a preliminary
to the Royal Easter Show. This tour was
the eighth. Different ground is covered
each year. It is possibly the closest thing
that newspapers will ever get to a
journalists’ picnic.
Of course, when a party of 30-odd
people from newspapers, radio and tele-
vision go along together, there is a
certain disparity of interest. Agricultural
writers stand enraptured with pencils
flying before glowering bulls, wallowing
pigs and sullen sheep. This is the really
solid stuff that keeps the country going,
even if it takes sample bags, fairy floss
and spacemen to get the crowds through
the turnstiles at Moore Park. But in the
tour, just as at the Show, there is some-
thing for everyone.
The tour is necessarily short. You may
not get to the roots of the grassroots,
but you get some interesting stuff to swap
over the trolleys at the supermarket. For
example, did you know that the manu-
facturers of smaligoods label their
sausages “breakfast sausages,” not be-
cause they care at all what time of the
day you eat them, but because mutton
(perhaps instead of the traditional bread-
crumbs) is used with beef. Another fact,
gleaned from the Letona cannery, is that
the syrup used for fruit canned for
Britain is heavier than that used here and
the syrup for Canada is sweeter still.
At the research station in the grounds
of Wagga Agricultural College they are
doing research into better types of soft
wheat. Millers have since the ’thirties
paid premium prices for hard wheat,
grown mostly in the north of the State
and planned to provide better bread.
Now the biscuit-makers’ demand for a
wheat consistently low in protein and
absorption has meant premium prices for
good soft wheats. This has come about
with the advent of packaged biscuits. A
variation of even one-hundredth of an
inch in the depth of a biscuit can throw
all the machinery out.
The tour took in McWilliams and
Penfolds wineries at vintage. Consump-
tion of table wines is slowly gaining on
sweet fortified wines, traditionally known
as plonk, but not within earshot of a
Penfold or a McWilliam. The proportion
at present stands at about one-third to
two-thirds, but the table wines, no matter
how hard we try, may never overtake
the dessert wines. Glorious thought is
that at the Penfolds winery 5+ acre-feet
of wine are stored.
An odd observation is that as country
life gets a little easier and cities spread
further, farmers tend to get up later and
city workers earlier. Visitors from the
city, used to getting up before seven to
spend H- hours travelling to work, find
that their country hosts often don't get
up before eight.
This is marginal stuff. If a separate
state isn't the life issue in the Riverina,
what is? As we got it from the lips of
a local shire councillor, it is decentralisa-
tion. We thought that hoary old hobby-
horse had galloped off into the wide blue
yonder years ago. But the whole argu-
ment comes out as fresh and muddled
as ever.
Decentralisation, point out the country
opinion-makers, has become something
of a cargo cult. “They expect to go to
sleep one night and wake up in the
morning to find a whole GMH factory
at the end of the main street.” The
opinion-makers don't think of GMH
factories or even of those small, isolated
enterprises which gave employment to
20-odd people for a few years before
going broke. They think mainly of in-
dustries related to the country. Instead
of a GMH factory at the end of the
main street they dream of the Mascot
boiling-down works. They know, vaguely
or well, what has been done in France
to decentralise. But however strongly the
concept of polarisation is accepted, it is
a different matter to find towns which
are prepared to let their neighbors grow
at their expense. “Leeton and Griffith

are worse than Melbourne and Sydney,”
say the locals, and rivalry between
Albury and Wagga shows no signs of
slowing down.
However, anything which brings
people to the country is decentralisation
in a sense. At present the first farmers
are moving into the Colleambally irriga-
tion area, which will eventually carry
something like 770 farms. Development
of the Colleambally area depends on
the completion of the Blowering dam,
part of the Snowy scheme, but which
is being built by the NSW Government.
Glamor crop
T>rogress at Coleambally, part of which
will be used for the Murrumbidgee
Irrigation Area’s new glamor crop,
cotton, was held up for years by the
inability of the State Government to
make up its mind whether it would go
ahead with the dam or not. Now new
settlers are moving in under conditions
similar to those met by the original MIA
settlers 50 years ago. In contrast with
the Ord and the Snowy, no township
has been planned or prepared at Coleam-
bally. The NSW Lands Department gave
the responsibility for building a town
to the local shire, which has about 400
ratepayers. There is still not even a
general store.
These are practical difficulties. As well,
the Coleambally farmers feel they are
facing what seems to them to be an
organised and vociferous anti-irrigation
faction. People in the MIA believe that
this faction, consisting mostly of city-
based economists, is closer to the ear of
politicians and the editors of metro-
politan dailies than they are. The
Development Bank is believed to be
strongly anti-irrigation. So are many
academics, with the ANU reportedly a
hotbed of propaganda on the subject.
The CSIRO is pro, and so is the Snowy
Mountains Authority. Within the MIA,
which is inclined to regard itself as an
experienced elder brother of newer
schemes, irrigated farming has a strong
champion in Mr Eric Hoare, of the
CSIRO Irrigation Research Laboratory,
Griffith. Mr Hoare has been in this
country from Britain only five years.
But with some justification country
people feel that lack of understanding
by politicians and others of the prospects
and problems of farming isolate the
farmer just as much as poor transport
and communications did in previous
generations. For example, the Riverina
people say the Prime Minister has never
visited their area. “He told me he
changed trains once at Narrandera when
he was a young barrister,” a local said.
“He asked then what the wines of the
area were like. He was told tolerable,
Apparently, that wasn't good enough
because he’s never been back.”


A SHORT STORY
UNPLANNED
DEVELOPMENT
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Bob Crampton dropped dead on the
14th green of the West Lynwood
course, having just failed to hole
a putt which would have given him a
par three.
An hour later Constable Ferguson
pressed the four-note chimes beside the
Riviera-pink door, then, following Isobel
Crampton into her Regency-reproduction
living room, broke the news to her in
the most tactful manner possible. Con-
stable Ferguson, who had been brought
up on a small dairy farm on the North
Coast, asked if he could call the neigh-
bors. Isobel frowned. Neighbors? Of
course, he meant the crowd at the golf
club, or the charming people who lived
in the surrounding streets, named after
Prime Ministers, or avenues, named after
Australian poets.
“I don't want to see anyone,” she said.
“But perhaps you could let the children
know.” “I'll send your children home,”
Constable Ferguson said, “but you must
have someone here with you now.” So
she told him Mrs Hardcastle, who lived
in the split level on the corner of Chifley
Street and Henry Kendall Avenue, and
Mrs Lewis in the first Cape Cod in Henry
Kendall Avenue after Lyons Street. Con-
stable Ferguson's handsome brow creased
over Cape Cod, so Isobel thought a
moment. No. 32, she said. He went,
first to tell the women, then to get the
children.
Nobel's children weren't due home
from school (Crampton had been playing
mid-week golf) for some time. Amanda
was at ballet class and Jonathan was
working for his Duke of Edinburgh
award. “Let Amanda finish her class,”
Isobel had said to Constable Ferguson,
“and tell Mr Throssell that Jonathan can
finish what he's doing before he comes
home.” Constable Ferguson, who when
his own father died had had to take
over milking 25 cows within the hour,
took it that Mrs Crampton did not really
understand yet what had happened and
put this curious attitude down to shock.
Several minutes passed after the con-
stable left. The women did not come.
Perhaps, Isobel thought, they were not
at home. Perhaps Helen Lewis was
caught up with the baby who had had
colic. Isobel, in a cashmere sweater and
pleated wool skirt, sat quietly with her
hands in her lap. She did not quite
know what to do or to think. She went
into the bedroom, wiped off the red lip-
stick she was wearing and put on pink
and took off her gold bracelet hung with
semi-precious stones. Then she went back
and sat down again. She looked around
her living-room at the furniture she and
Bob had so carefully chosen, the curtains
and covers she had so skilfully made.
The house represented everything they
had dreamt of, everything they had
worked towards, in 16 years of marriage.
Now he would never see it again. He
would never again come through the
front-door, first playing a jolly little tune
on the chimes to let her know he was
home. Never again walk through the
house for which they'd saved and worked
so hard. He had gone and left every-
thing, including a £7OOO mortgage,
behind.
Ohe began to cry. She regretted now
that she had never had a love affair
before she met Bob and grew resentful
that they had been married without his
ever proposing properly. She felt that
she had missed a lot. While her tears
flowed, she heard the sounds of husbands
returning from work, thrusting their cars
up concrete driveways and slamming the
brakes on at the last possible second to
avoid hitting fancy brick walls or knock-
ing over potted monsteria. There was the
sound of a vicious, headstrong motor-
mower, and the cries of parents calling
their children to come in this minute.
Now she was cut off from all this. She
was husbandless. She just couldn't
believe it had happened to her and not
to someone else.
“I just can’t believe it,” Madge Hard-
castle cried when Isobel opened the door
to the sound of chimes. “I’m so shocked.”
Isobel even in her distraction felt
angry. She was the one who was not
able to believe it. She was the one who
was shocked. After all, it was her husband
who had died. She felt a not rare resent-
ment towards Madge.
But Isobel recovered her position
quickly. She sank back into her chair
and sobbed.
“I feel it's all my fault,” she cried.
“It was I who made him take up mid-
week golf. I told him he needed more
exercise for his health.” She wailed again.
“And that it was good for business.”
Business, and he was dead at 38 without
ever becoming a senior executive,
although, of course, he had got to the
stage when he could play mid-week golf
with clients.
“But, Isobel, nobody could have ex-
pected it,” Madge said. “You always
looked after Bob so well.”
“Yes, Isobel,” Helen said. “Don’t think
that way. Don't reproach yourself.”
After that, like a shower of rain pass-
ing, the emotion drained away. Isobel
had made her point. She was the bereft.
Then they were back on the smooth,
skimming basis of friendship between
members of the West Lynwood Golf
Club.
“I’ll make you a cup of tea,” Helen
said.
“I couldn’t drink it.”
“But you must have one,” Madge in-
sisted.
“Well,” Isobel said. “I'll come and
show you where things are. The kitchen
is in a mess.”
“In your house,” Helen said. “Every-
thing is always in its place.” She went
into the kitchen, the design for which
had been torn from an American
“House and Garden” and which still
looked like a color reproduction of a
kitchen, and where tea was in a canister
marked tea and sugar in a canister
marked sugar.
“Where are the children?” Madge
asked in the living-room.
“Constable Ferguson went to get them,
but I told him to let Amanda finish her
ballet class. She does love it so.”
“Oh,” Madge said, remembering that
Isobel was quite a stupid woman, but

wondering just what you were supposed
to do when your husband died.
“Constable Ferguson is a very pleasant
young man.” she said. “For a police-
man. He's well suited to this area.”
“Yes. What an awful job, though!
Having to tell people—l felt sorry for
him. He asked if he could call the neigh-
bors. It sounded so odd. Like paling
fences and cups of tea. You don’t think
of the people around here as neighbors.”
“No, not in that way. But there’s such
a wonderful spirit here. Look how every-
one worked together for the community
centre! And remember the agitation to
get a shelter at the bus-stop! But people
here never interfere, never intrude.”
“Exactly,” Jsobel said.
“Ed hate to live anywhere else,”
Madge said. She lit a cigarette. “I was
looking at Constable Ferguson at the
school-crossing the other day. He looks
so young. And quite divine-looking. They
say it’s a sign that you're getting on when
you begin to notice how young police-
men look.”
“I never notice them,” Isobel said.
Madge could well believe it. But she
should not have said that about Constable
Ferguson. You couldn't talk about hand-
some young policemen to a woman whose
husband might even now be lying dead
on the 14th green—-the 14th was 180
yards, uphill with a bit of a dog-leg,
Madge recalled, but you wouldn’t think
it would kill anyone. What would Isobel
do now? Madge looked across the mush-
room-pink carpet at Isobel and was aware
of the gulf widening between them.
Helen came in with the tea, but the
three women only went through a form
of drinking it, raising cups to their lips
and sipping, frowning. As soon as
Amanda came home, her pink ballet
slippers in her hand and her face white,
Madge and Helen left.
Amanda was shocked, but at 13, a
quiet and sensible girl, she felt that, after
all, her mother had had the greater loss.
Jonathan went to his mother’s arms. With
her two chicks under her wing, Isobel
began to feel a plucky little widow.
She explained that they would never
see their Daddy again, something which
the children had perfectly understood and
perfectly accepted from Constable Fer-
guson. Amanda’s brow drew to a frown
and she looked at Jonathan over her
mother's faded gold head. What would
they do about Mother?
They would never see Daddy again,
Isobel insisted. Unless—she said to her-
self, and her heart shrank, because she
had never seen a corpse, not even her
mother. At this moment she could
visualise Bob lying on the 14th green in


‘SCRATCHING AROUND’
FOR EXPORT MARKETS?
TRV SOUTH AFRICA
“Side-tripping” to South Africa, on your way to
(or from) Europe/U.K.. is a very logical thing to
do. Firstly, it enables you to investigate per-
sonally today’s excellent export opportunities in
South Africa and her northern neighbours.
Secondly, it offers wondrous sight-seeing
opportunities (such as Kruger National Park) —
a welcome break from the beaten tracks of tra-
ditional routes. And finally, it costs as little as
£15.10.0* in extra air fares, including S.A.A.’s
Boeing Stratojet service between London and
Jo’burg. Your travel agent has full details.

his yellow wool shirt with the shadow
check and his grey Daks, the putter
beside him. In actual fact, he was already,
as Constable Ferguson had told her, in
the morgue of the North Side hospital.
Would they—who were they in a case
like this?—expect her to go and look at
his body? Identify him? What did one
do about death these days? In a place
like West Lynwood it seemed so remote.
As it turned out there was no problem
at all. The cremation the next day w'as
handled quite beautifully. Apart from a
few awkw'ard moments when Mr Kent
had to interrupt his soothing flow of
words to read the prayers laid down in
the book of Common Prayer, you would
hardly have know'n it was a funeral.
Quite a number of the crow'd from the
golf club were there, many of whom
Isobel had never seen before without
either a golf bag on their shoulder or a
glass in their hand.
It was the first funeral that Isobel had
been to since she had come to live at
West Lynwood. In fact, she reflected, as
she lay sleepless that night in the spare
bed in Amanda’s room, Bob was the
first person to die in West Lynw'ood that
she could think of. There were some old
cottages towards Lynwood proper. The
old people who lived in them must some-
times leave the rattan chairs on weather-
board verandahs and go inside quietly to
die. But nobody in the streets, named
after Prime Ministers, or the avenues,
named after Australian poets, had died
in West Lynwood’s 10 years of existence
as a higher-income-level planned develop-
ment.
Of course, death touched them at
times in a remote way. The Arnolds’ son
had been killed when his car overturned
in Europe, but he had been buried in
Switzerland. Isobel’s mother had died
only three years ago and had been buried
from an old bluestone church in the hot
Western Suburbs. Other people occasion-
ally had an elderly parent living with
them for a time but these went decently
to a home or hospital before the time
came to die.
Isobel looked unblinkingly through the
darkness to the ceiling which she had
so competently papered in tiny sulphur
roses on ivory. No one ever died in West
Lynwood. Her burden of guilt seemed
heavier. She had killed her husband and
she had brought death to West Lynwood.
She closed her eyes. From the other bed
Amanda gave the quick, nervous cry
which children sometimes give in their
sleep while their faces show nothing. I
am alone, Isobel said, what shall I do?
There were people to help her decide
w'hat she should do. Madge was right.
There was a wonderful community spirit
in West Lynw'ood. The crowd from the
golf club took on the attributes of neigh-
bors. That is, they freely gave advice.
Madge and Helen came some time each
afternoon for the next few days, always
together. They gave barbiturates and
sympathy, so that Isobel no longer gazed
at the sulphur roses but crept back
between her own sheets.
After a week or so Madge broached
the subject of Isobel's plans. Helen was
in the kitchen making tea, her hands
moving easily from canister to canister.
“Isobel,” Madge said, as Helen passed
cups, “have you thought about what
you're going to do? I mean, if there’s
anything we can do—”
“You mean about the house and the
children and money? Of course I have.
For a whole week I’ve thought of
nothing else. Except Bob, of course.” She
paused and her lip trembled, but she
raised her cup and sipped her tea.
“Things are going to be very different
from now on.” The cup banged un-
steadily on the saucer. “The main thing
is the children. I want' them to have
everything that Bob wanted them to
have.”
The two women nodded encourage-
ment.
“You'll keep them at Clanbank and
Lynwood?” Madge said.

“Oh, I hope so. I hope so. I want
that above everything. And Mandy’s so
talented at ballet. I want her to have
that. I’ll do everything I can. First, I’ll
get a job.”
“That will mean dropping out of the
Thursday tennis,” Madge said.
“And the Tuesday morning golf,”
Helen said, and in the pause that
followed she accepted Madge’s frown of
reproof at this tactlessness.
“I might even sell the house,” Isobel
said, her handkerchief going to her eyes
again.
“Leave West Lynwood?” the women
cried together. “That would be a complete
tragedy,” Madge said.
“I might have to,” Isobel said.
“Daddy’s a widower. He has his own
house in the Western Suburbs. He lives
alone. It would be sensible to go and live
with him.”
“The Western Suburbs!” the women
cried.
“The children couldn’t travel all that
way to school each day,” Madge pointed
out.
Isobel smiled bravely, very much the
plucky little widow. She could now see
herself clearly in this role with, miracu-
lously, her hair as golden as it had been
on her wedding day and her body re-
lieved of the eight or nine pounds she
had been trying to lose for several years.
She could almost hear herself being
called a brave little woman by someone
with a gruff, manly voice.
“I have a plan,” Madge said. “I'll get
Bruce to come around tonight after
dinner and talk it over with you. He’s
an accountant, so he'll know what can be
done. He can work all sorts of fiddles
with income tax. He’ll work it so you
.can stay.”
This was agreed on and the women
left.
“Tt’s a problem,” Helen said as they
A crossed Henry Kendall Avenue.
“Yes, but I'm sure Bruce will fix
things,” Madge said. “Isobel is only too
willing to sacrifice herself. She'll enjoy
the martyrdom. I know that sort of
woman. She'll leave here, cut her child-
ren off from their friends, their schools,
everything, and never ask was it really
necessary.”
Helen turned aside to wave to Phil
Menser as he came out of his garage.
“That’s another thing,” she said. “It’ll
make a difference having no husband.”
“Awkard socially,” Madge said. “We
won’t be able to have her to dinner
parties. Unless there's a spare man.”
“I haven't got a spare man,” Helen
said.
“I’ve got George.”
“Yes, of course. Then there’s the other
thing. Mind you, I don’t make Frank sit
up and beg for it, but if I don’t feel
like it he doesn’t get it. All the same,
I’ll admit I wouldn’t feel too happy about
having it cut off, just like that. It’d be
like giving up smoking.”
“Don’t talk about that. I counted the
other day. Thirty-five in one day.”
“I’ve been trying to cut down. None
before lunch. None watching TV.”
“I always give up like that,” Madge
said, flicking her fingers. “Cutting down
doesn’t work. Smoke the last one in the
packet and that’s that. I never eat
sweets either or anything like that.”
“Oh, I couldn’t eat sweets! I’d be the
size of a house.”
“But it always breaks down. Some-
thing happens and I’m off like a chimney
again.”
“Yes, it’s a problem.”
Isobel remained a problem, too, even
after Bruce Hardcastle came that evening.
Isobel sat at his elbow and answered
questions while he went through the con-
certina file into which Bob had somewhat
carelessly put the papers that represented
their financial future. She had opened the
bottle of beer she had put in the re-
frigerator a week ago for Bob to have
after his golf, and had made some ham
and sour cucumber sandwiches.
Hardcastle talked about superannua-
tion, overdrafts and mortgages. The
extent of her indebtedness did not
embarrass Isobel. In West Lynwood you
were expected to owe money, but, other-
wise, she had only the vaguest idea of
her financial position. Hardcastle ex-
plained that she could stay at West Lyn-
wood and keep the children at their
schools only by eating into the lump sum
from superannuation to meet interest
payments on the mortgage and by taking
a full-time job to meet day-to-day ex-
penses as best she could. By the time
the children left school she would have
very little superannuation left and she
would still be a long way from owning
the house. On the other hand, if she
sold the house, went to live with her
father and took a job she would manage
very easily. She could keep the children
at their schools; although it would mean
a lot of travelling for them.
“Of course,” Isobel said, lifting her
chin. “I’ll go and live with Daddy.”
Hardcastle sipped his beer and nodded
approval. He looked around the living-
room which was almost identical with
his own and then at Isobel. He didn’t
know her much. She was younger than
Madge. Prettier. A different type. But
until now he had never spoken to her
much. Not that men and women didn’t
mix freely in West Lynwood. They did,
and nearly bored themselves silly at times
trying to prove that the old Australian
cliche about the segregation of the sexes
was no longer valid.
“You know, you're being pretty
plucky about this,” he ventured, and
Isobel smiled in radiant recognition.
Several times during Hardcastle’s
nocturnal visits it was decided that Isobel
would sell the house and go and live

with her father. Each time the decision
was reversed during the afternoon visits
of Madge and Helen. In the end it was
their will which prevailed. “Isobel will
get married again,” Madge told her hus-
band. “In West Lynwood she’ll meet the
sort of man who can give her the life
she’s been used to, who can take over
the children and the mortgage. But out
there —” “But all the men here are
married,” Hardcastle pointed out. “But
they know the sort of man that Isobel
should marry,” Madge said. “I feel it's
letting us all down if Isobel goes. What
does West Lynwood stand for if she gives
up without a struggle and goes out to the
Western Suburbs? If anything happened
to you, I’d fight to the bitter end to
stay here.”
"JV/r adge showed that she really meant to
help Isobel by finding a job for her
at the Knick Knack, the pretty little shop
where they sold the most divine things
in West Lynwood’s planned shopping
centre. Isobel dusted the wooden salad
bowls and wiped the thumb prints off
the white-painted kitchen novelties.
Sometimes she sold things, mainly to her
friends. Then she discovered that Mrs.
Wyatt who owned the shop was a steady
and not very silent drinker, so she left.
“Just the same I think I need some-
thing with more future in it,” she put
it to Madge. “After all, I have to think
ahead.”
Madge frowned and took the problem
of Isobel back to her husband.
“I thought you said there was a lot
of work in your office at the end of the
financial year,” she said.
“Yes, why?”
“Isobel. She’s left the Knick Knack.
She says that Mrs Wyatt drinks, although
I can hardly believe that. She says she
wants something with some future in it.
I suppose she’s right. Could you try her
out in your office?”
“Can she type?”
“She says she can. She could go in
with you in the mornings. That would
save her fares. It all helps, you know.”
Hardcastle knew that now that Madge
was down to discussing details he might
as well regard the basic idea as set. He
didn’t mind really. After all, they had to
do something about Isobel.
About three months after Isobel was
widowed, Madge decided it was time to
bring her back into the social life of
West Lynwood. She arranged a dinner-
party for eight and invited her brother,
George. George was legally a spare man,
but Madge, who saw him rarely, had no
real idea how his failed marriage had
twisted his soul. His wife’s open contempt
for him had made him feel ridiculous,
but her astuteness at gaining handsome
alimony had made him feel even more
foolish. He could hardly afford the
upkeep of his charming flat at Elizabeth
Bay, his own little dinner-parties, his
collection of stereophony and his annual
trips to the snow. Madge’s dinner-party
was a disaster; George openly scornful
of West Lynwood's mores and of
Madge’s vichyssoise from a tin, Isobel
at first coy and silly, finally drunk and
weepy.
Madge gritted her teeth over the
George fiasco. After that, Isobel was
asked around for drinks on Sunday
morning and to an odd cocktail party,
but no one was able, or prepared, to
produce a spare man for dinner again.
However, Isobel seemed to be getting on
all right at Bruce’s office. Bruce picked
her up at her gate each morning in his
station-waggon and brought her home
every evening. He now rarely stayed in
town for drinks with men-friends or a
visit to his club. So, Madge decided, it
was an ill wind. . . .
But, inevitably, Isobel began to drift
away. She went for Sunday walks alone,
passing houses where husband and wife
worked together in the garden. She
would stop and discuss bulbs or pruning,
then move on alone. Or she would walk
around the rim of the golf course, where
players suddenly concentrated on their
strokes as she passed. She lived at West
Lynwood but she no longer belonged.
Sometimes on Saturday or Sunday she
took the children across to see her father.
She would spend the afternoon helping
him in his garden, where he still grew
the old flowers, larkspurs, clarkia,
aquilegia, that he had grown when she
was a child. He had always fancied him-
self as a cook, although he had only
picked up the knack of scones and fruit
rolls from her mother. But there would
be a long high tea, after which she
would hate the thought of the trip back
to West Lynwood. “It’s getting used to
public transport again,” she said to her
father.
At the end of September, six months
after Crampton died, the annual
dinner-dance of the golf club was in
prospect. Madge grew obstinate. Some-
thing must be done some time towards
finding someone to take over Isobel, her
children and her mortgage. Isobel must
somehow be found a partner for the
dance. Madge cast about her and her
eye lit on her elder son.
“I don’t see why Timothy can't take
Isobel to the golf-club dance,” she said
to her husband.
“Good God, Isobel is old enough to
be his mother.”
“Well, she’s not his mother. I am, and
I say he can take her. He’s nearly 19,
old enough to learn social respon-
sibilities.”
“But he's got Fiona.” 1
“He’s not engaged to Fiona. He can
take Isobel and I’ll pay for the tickets.”
It was easy to order Timothy but
harder to persuade Isobel. In fact, Isobel
was persuaded only when Bruce, driving
her to work one morning later in the
week, said, “Do come. It’ll do you good
to get out a bit.”
Jt might have been all right if Timothy
had been the ordinary, insolent young
man, but he was grave and polite. He
smiled without flinching when Isobel
could not follow his style of dancing
at all, and let his eyes slide off her face
when she grew flushed from drink and
heat.
His air that there was absolutely
nothing in the world he would rather do
than be with Isobel at the golf-club
dance finally unnerved her. She pressed
her cheek with the back of one hand
and looked around the crowded room.
“Do you think we could get some
air?” she asked. “It’s simply stifling in
here.”
They went on to the terrace. The
half-dozen there turned to look, then
turned away again. It was quite normal
behavior but Isobel convinced herself it
was not.
“It’s so crowded here,” she said.
“Could we go for a little walk?”
Timothy nodded brightly and took her
arm to help her down the rough-hewn
stone steps. They walked towards the
first fairway. Isobel now began to move
quickly, plunging across the grass in her
thin shoes.
Then she stopped. “This is the 14th
green,” she said. “Did you know my
husband died on the 14th green? Just
here. This is the first time I’ve seen it
since.”
This was too much for Timothy. He
frowned and mumbled.
Isobel felt he hadn’t understood what
she had said. She grasped his arms to
shake sense into him. “He died just
here,” she insisted.
“Isobel!” Bruce Hardcastle cried as he
came towards them. He staggered like
an old man because the smooth soles
of his dancing shoes would not carry him
easily across the sand hazard. “For God’s

Isobel was grateful that, of course,
Bruce's children did not go with them.
They stayed in West Lynwood with their
mother. She never wanted to see Timothy
again after that embarrassing incident on
the 14th green.
She moved away from Bruce in the
front seat of the station-waggon and
fanned herself with a newspaper.
“Lord, it's hot now,” she said.
“We’re getting further north,” he said.
“The last signpost was five miles to
Murwillumbah.”
“Perhaps we could stop for a drink,”
she said. She spun around. “Would you
like a drink or an ice-cream, children?”
Amanda and Jonathan nodded. They
had been quarrelling amiably over the
restricted sitting space in the back of the
station-waggon, loaded almost to the roof
with the entire portable possessions of
the Crampton family and Hardcastle.
They were in a state of excitement at
leaving West Lynwood, at this un-
expected trip, at the thought of a new
home. They seemed almost to entertain
some foolish idea that from now on life
would be one long holiday.
“Here’s a cafe,” Isobel said. “Here.
Stop here, darling. You children can get
out and buy the drinks.”
“Can we have a drink and an ice-
cream?” Jonathan asked.
“Yes, if you like,” Isobel said, smiling
at Bruce. “Just this once. A plain ice-
cream cone for me. What’s for you
darling? And a coke for Uncle Bruce.”
Qhe watched the children skitter across
the pebbled path to the shabby
cafe.
“Darling,” she said. “Our motel won’t
be like that, will it?”
“That dump! Good God, no! It’s got
a swimming-pool and restaurant.”
“That’s good. I’d hate to think of us
living in a place like that. I hope it goes
all right. After all, we’ve had no ex-
perience at this sort of thing. I’m begin-
ning to get cold feet rather. I suppose
it’s nervous reaction after the strain of
the past few weeks. I do rather wish
we’d told Madge. I know' we decided
not to, but somehow it does seem mean.
In a way, though, it’s her own fault.
After all, I wanted to go and live with
Daddy. She made me stay at West
Lynwood. What would she expect w'ould
happen?”
“This, perhaps, this.”
“But I don’t feel bitter towards her.
Not at all. I only hope she can manage
to stay at Lynwood. She does love it so.”


Australian Premiers -IV
Thomas Reibey
Church , State and a sex scandal in Van Diemen's Land
By M. H. ELLIS
At the end of 1792, just before the
departure from NSW of Governor
Phillip, there arrived in Sydney:
(a) a large consignment of rum and
porter which made the colonists beat
their wives and burn down their huts,
and (b) a young lady aged about 15
named Mary Haydock who had been
sent to Botany Bay to atone for her sin.
A tale as good as any was that Mary,
orphaned daughter of a Lancashire sur-
veyor, while at a ladies’ school put on
boys’ clothing on a Sabbath afternoon
and stole a pony in a field for a lark
and was caught in the act. Horse
stealing by anybody in England
around 1790 was a very serious offence.
So off she went to NSW.
However, chance was kind to her.
She did not suffer the fate worse than
death which was apt to befall young
ladies of 15 who voyaged to Australia
in convict ships in those days. She
fell into the arms of a young officer of
the ship whose name was spelt variously
as Raby, Reiby or Reibey, the last form
becoming permanent. She married him.
When he went for voyages as a coastal
trader or to India she showed herself a
shrewd young business woman.
After her husband perished in 1811
as the result of the Indian climate and
possibly its favorite remedy (brandy
paunee), her concerns as a merchant and
farm chatelaine expanded more regularly
than those of most inhabitants, for she
had the advantage of being a woman and
therefore excluded from politics and the
taste for rum, and she had the sense to
build fine buildings when they were most
needed during the Macquarie era (in-
cluding one which she rented to the
Bank of New South Wales when it was
founded in 1817).
By 1820 she was a rich woman and
was able to take her daughters “home”
and launch them into society and be
received in triumph in her native town
of Blackburn in Lancashire.
In the next year there was born in
Tasmania to one of her sons who had
settled there in the delightful manor of
Entally at Westbury since acquired by
the Tasmanian Government as a relic of
more spacious days her grandson,
Thomas Reibey, first and last of his Tas-
manian born line. His birthday was Sep-
tember 24, 1821 only a few weeks after
the end of Governor Macquarie’s final
tour of Van Diemen’s Land.
Far different was the atmosphere of
his youth from that of his mother. He
lived in a world of mansions and squires
in his adolescence, a world that would
have been home to Surtees.
His mentor was Harry Jellicoe of
Quorn Hall near Campbell Town, who,
while Tom Reibey was in his teens,
presented him with a pack of hounds.
This was the beginning of young
Reibey's education before he was sent
to England to matriculate into Trinity
Hall, Oxford, to train for the Church.
He left Oxford unhooded to return home
and assume his patrimony, carrying
letters dimissory from the Bishop of
Exeter which secured him patronage
from Bishop Francis Henry Nixon, Tas-
mania’s first bishop who quickly had him
ordained as deacon. He was now the
Squire of Entally.
Livings, however, were not exactly
plentiful in Tasmania but to a squire
this fact presented no difficulty. He
had a parish created on the Norfolk
Plains called Carrick and endowed a
church for himself and for many a year
(without stipend) distributed the consola-
tions of religion among the Van Demon-
ians in general. His intimates ranged
from Government House to his neigh-
bor Richard Dry on Quamby. And he
still held on to his Quorn Hall hounds
and his rods and his gun. Indeed,
when Bishop Nixon offered to appoint
him Archdeacon of Launceston, he de-
clined on the ground that the incum-
bency of that exalted post would interfere
with his hunting and fishing. But even-
tually he gave in and became an Arch-
deacon.
Luxuriating in his archdeaconate he
seemed to conduct a mission to the dogs
rather than to the morally very needy
inhabitants of Van Diemen’s Land —-
until around the fateful year 1868, when
there were rumors that the Archdeacon
was indulging in a new sport. In that
fateful year, he was engaged in some
small controversy over an appointment
to the cure of souls at St John’s Church
in Launceston, an affair in which his
early indifference suddenly changed be-
wilderingly to warm dissent which led
presently to his apparently inexplicable
resignation and retirement into the
solitude of his estate for three long
years. During that period the agri-
cultural shows saw him no more. The
hunts were bare of his hounds and of
his tall figure with its flowing beard.
All this was mysterious to the common
man.
Yet, behind the closed veil of class
security which surrounded the life of
the upper crust of the County, was
concealed an astonishing tale. For a
young lady alleged that on a Sabbath
afternoon the worthy cleric called upon
her and in her own drawing-room
sought to give her a practical lesson in
masculine anatomy which much affronted
the proprieties. It was, in fact, alleged
that he had “betrayed the confidence of
his oldest and dearest friend” by “seeking
to corrupt the chastity of that friend’s
daughter—and that daughter one who
has grown up from childhood under his
own eye and for whom his feelings
should have been of a paternal
character.”
The retreat into the haven of Entally
far from the censorious world was ex-
plained by himself at a later stage in a
pamphlet. He declared that his sup-
posed sin was not the cause of his
resignation from his Church office. Mr
B. the complainant, he said, had ridden
to Entally and “made the false and foul
charges against me”. And Mr B. had
asserted that he had held back from
taking criminal action only because the
errant shepherd had promised to resign
his office and leave Tasmania. But the
shepherd himself gave clerical differences
as his reason, adding, “There is no
wound So sore as the poisonous sting
which the slanderer can inflict . . . such
hurts are hellish pain.” “The sore . . .
will poison and burn until death shall
come,” reflected the wretched exile at
Entally, to which he had retired to suffer
his agony.
He brought a libel action which
was heard before the redoubtable
Sir Francis Villeneuve Smith, C.J;
and whatever one may think of
His Honor’s charge to the jury as a
judicial document it contains proof of
the lengths to which the leaders of Tas-
manian society were ready to go to
protect a close friend. His Honor
warned the lieges in the jury box that
what they were doing, in effect, was to

find a good and pious man guilty or
not guilty of a charge that he had
committed “an aggravated criminal
assault” on the daughter of his old and
trusted friend, followed up by “frightful,
solemn and wicked perjury”; to find in
effect that "having failed in his base
attempt upon (the young lady’s) virtue,
he had resorted to the unmanly shift
of casting the blame upon her and
saying she was the tempter.” And he
warned them of the results to a virtuous
man of a verdict against him.
All unmoved by His Honor’s pathetic
oration, the jury found for the defendant
and the matter had further consequences
when the squire was told by his friend
Mr Meredith that it was commonly
being asserted that he was afraid to
emerge from seclusion to meet a re-
quisition by admiring friends to stand
for Parliament.
“Then”, said the gallant recluse,
“stand I will.” Whereupon a number
of virtuous electors wrote to the Press
recalling the libel action and the Chief
Justice’s charge to the jury and holding
that if her would-be seducer were coun-
tenanced as a legislator it would be tanta-
mount to a base reflection on the virtue
and veracity of the young lady involved.
were more actions in which the
attackers of the Archdeacon's virtue
seem to have come off best, but that did
not prevent him from being elected un-
opposed in 1'874 for the fourth largest
parliamentary constituency in Tasmania,
being leader of the Opposition within
a year afterwards and being sent for
by the Governor, Sir Frederick Wells
on July 20, 1876, two years after he
entered Parliament, to become one of
Tasmania's fly-by-night annual premiers.
He remained in office for a year and a
fortnight and is remembered for only
one notable act: He reformed Tas-
mania's horrible prisons of which he
made a study, and abolished the hell-
hole of Port Arthur.
Then he retired to the leadership of
the Opposition, later refusing a second
term as Premier and preferring to hand
the office to his friend Dr Crowther and
serve under him as a Minister. He sat fit-
fully in Opposition for some years, cross-
ing the House when his conscience moved
him to abandon Braddon or- Dobson on
some issue. He served a brief while
as a Minister Without Portfolio in one
of Braddon’s ministries and eventually
they made him Speaker and he held
office for four years ending in 1891
with great dignity and fairness and re-
mained in Parliament until after Federa-
tion, when he retired from politics.
- In his later years, his love for the dog
world did not prevent him from be-
coming a great figure in Australian
racing. But the malign fate that seemed
to clamp down on him, marring hiis
clerical life and denying him great emi-
nence in politics followed him to the Turf.
He was famous for his virtues as an
owner, one who never had a bet, never
made a wager, yet one who owned
nags with names that in their day were
household words and sources of lucre
to bookies and jockeys and punters
alike. At last there came an afternoon
in 1882 which seemed likely to crown
his racing career with the winning of
the Melbourne Cup. All the odds were
on his Speedwell that day. But as he
stood at the rails at Flemington, sharing
his umbrella with the legendary "Honest
John” Tait, it was impossible to hear
anything for the gusty rain squalls except
the yells of "Speedwell! Speedwell
wins!” from a populace far back in the
mist, or to see anything but the sinister
though fog-hung centaur of Assyrian
showing a clean tail to the field and
Speedwell from go to whoa. It was
little consolation to the venerable ex-
Archdeacon that "Honest John” in his
indignation smashed the umbrella as he
shouted: "By God, Tom, you lost a
grand race by bad riding or something
worse.”
In his old age the man who could
boast the strangest life and career of
any Australian Premier appears in his
portraits as a mild, somewhat bewildered
old gentleman with pop eyes above a
narrow silver spade beard which Aaron
would have treasured.
Apart from its content, indeed, his
life had a remarkable span. He wr?s
born while Macquarie was still Governor
of New South Wales, of which Van
Diemen’s Land was still part when
the continent and its southern appendage
had not yet acquired officially the name
"Australia” and had a population of
under 40,000, convicts and visiting
military included. He lived till February
10, 1912, to see the Commonwealth
more than a decade old with a popula-
tion of 4.6 millions and with Australia
on the verge of sending abroad, within
the following six years, an army twelve
times as numerous as the whole popula-
tion of the continent when he was born.


OVERSEAS
France’s Bright New
Oriental Look
Icing magnificent, but what about the cake?
From STANLEY KARNOW in Hong Kong
'VTurtured by President de Gaulle’s
recent recognition of China, the
French presence is beginning to bloom
in the Far East. Like so much else in
the French realm, however, it is difficult
to distinguish between mere appearance
and significant reality. The icing is
magnificent but it is still to be proved
whether there is genuine cake beneath it.
Certainly in the field of what they
persist in calling “manifestations”, the
French are hard to beat. In Hong
Kong, for example, they have been
holding a “French Fortnight”, and this
British colonial community has' rarely
enjoyed such a pleasant divertissement.
There have been parties, wine-tastings,
ballet performances, avant garde films
and a visit by the attractive actress My-
lene Demongeot. The shops displayed
miniature Eiffel Towers and tricolors.
On the surface, at least, the cultural
crusade appears to have left enough of
an impression on local residents to have
increased enrolment in French-language
classes by 75 per cent over the past
year. Of course, as French teachers
readily explain, students are far less
interested in Corneille and Racine than
in learning the Gallic idiom for business
purposes. For they have all read the
publicity about the promising French
commercial boom in Asia, and they
want to know how to count their francs.
French trade fairs are scheduled for
Hong Kong, Manila and Peking this
year, and there may be similar shows
in Bangkok and Singapore. With the
signing last May of the commercial
agreement between Japan and France,
there has been much talk of increased
business between those two countries.
But the chances of a radical lift in trade
between France and Asia are rather
minimal. Individual companies may
profit, but overall commercial increases
are not likely in the near future.
At the moment, Asian business inter-
est in France is highly selective. Several
countries are attracted by French capital
equipment for such projects as fertiliser
plants, railways, dams and airports. The
Caravelle aircraft is popular and is now
being used by the Thais and Indians.
The possibility for consumer goods is
limited, however, for many reasons.
Markets for foreign merchandise in each
Asian country are small, and often their
deve/opment is inhibited by tight trade
restrictions to prevent the outflow of
foreign exchange.
At the same time, there is still a resi-
due of protectionism in France that
keeps doors closed to Asian products.
Last year French purchases from Japan
trailed those of Britain, Germany and
other Europeans. Though the recently
signed agreement is supposed to cor-
rect it, the imbalance of Franco-Japan-
ese trade in favor of France has not
pleased Japan.
The hope that China’s 700 million
customers will be available to France is
one of those dreams that has been
tempting European businessmen for de-
cades. But Chinese purchasing power is
restricted by shortage of exchange and
lack of desirable merchandise to balance
trade. French exports to China last
year, which consisted principally of
grains, were valued at only about $6O
million. France may be able to push
sales to China up to about $lOO million
per year. This might require an exten-
sion of long-term credit to the Chinese
Even so, China trade within the con-
text of total French commerce is likely
to remain a very small fraction.
Without doubt, the greatest impact
France is making in Asia is political.
De Gaulle’s recognition of the Peking
regime is certain to inspire shifts in
alignments, and the new attitudes will
not be statistically clear until next
autumn when UN members stand up to
be counted on the question of China’s
seat. At present, however, de Gaulle’s
advocacy of neutralisation for South-
east Asia has principally served to di-
vide and confuse a region already Bal-
kanised beyond easy comprehension.
It had been hoped, for example, that
the traditional rivalry between South
Vietnam and Cambodia could be patch-
ed up. But by suggesting that Saigon
accepts neutralism and reunification,
which would clearly lead to a Commu-
nist takeover, while supplying Cambodia
with tanks and jet aircraft, de Gaulle
has exacerbated relations between the
two neighbors.
Though these moves have played into
the policies of Peking, de Gaulle has
received precious little in the way of
thanks from the Chinese. On the con-
trary, the Peking Press openly criticised
the General for “honoring” the “trai-
tor Chiang Kai-shek” in his Press con-
ference early last month. Furthermore,
Peking indicated its irritation with de
Gaulle’s suggestion that China’s progress
was attributable to the Communists’ “im-
placable control of the masses”.
Analysts here do not expect that
France and China will have an easy
relationship in future. For in his in-
tense nationalism and sense of righteous-
ness, nobody quite resembles a French-
man so much as a Chinese. (ofns)

Mr. Khrushchev’s Trouble
in Albania
A foothold for China in Europe
From EDWARD CRANKSHAW in Lonlon
latest incident in Russia’s dispute
A with Albania the seizure by the
Tirana Government of the last remain-
ing Soviet Embassy buildings, appears
to make the breach between the two
countries absolute. But Albania, the
smallest and weakest of all the Com-
munist States, and the one most de-
pendent on material aid from the Soviet
Union, manages to survive.
What is more, although her masters
have defied Russia in language unpre-
cedented far more violent and con-
demnatory than the language used by the
Yugoslavs at the height of their quarrel
with Stalin she still maintains her
links and a certain amount of trade with
at least some of the East European
satellites Poland, Bulgaria, East Ger-
many, and, most demonstratively,
Rumania.
Because Albania has always been
thought of as nothing but a pawn in
the great Sino-Soviet dispute, very little
attention has been paid to its own
peculiar position. When, in November,
1960, Enver Hoxha stood up in the
Kremlin and denounced Khrushchev
before the assembled delegates of 81
Communist Parties for betraying the
memory of Stalin and the whole Com-
munist movement, and for trying to
starve Albania into submission, this was
seen simply as a supporting move in the
interests of China.
When, at the 22nd Party Congress in
October, 1961, Khrushchev publicly at-
tacked the Albanian leadership in
equally violent terms, the world was so
caught up by the implications of the
Sino-Soviet dispute that for Albania it
read China and did not stop to ask why
on earth Albania should be in that gal-
lery at all.
But Albania, squeezed between
Greece, Yugoslavia and the sea, a tangle
of mountains, primitive and wild in
life and aspect, is a country in its own
right. Its existence, its survival as an
anti-Soviet Communist land, presents
Khrushchev with problems which, at the
very least, enlarge the area of dispute
between Moscow and Peking and also
confuse it. The Chinese know this very
well and are prepared to make sacri-
fices to keep this tiny country, so insig-
nificant, so far away, on its feet. So,
perhaps, are other Communist Parties,
above all the Rumanian.
It has always been Albania's lot to
act as a stalking horse in the manoeuv-
ring of large Powers and, at the same
time, to gain from this an importance
disproportionate to its size and wealth.
Kaiser Wilhelm II could dismiss it
contemptuously and ask rhetorically
why anyone should go to war for the
sake of “the miserable goat pastures of
Scutari”. But the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, Serbia and Italy skirmished

confidently round and about this tiny
stretch of land the Italians looking
for a foothold on the Eastern Adriatic,
the Serbs seeking a way to the sea, the
Austrians seeking to contain them both.
After the First World War she main-
tained her existence under King Zog,
but with the triumph of the Communists
in 1946, it looked as though Communist
Yugoslavia and Communist Albania
would work in amity. In the whole of
Eastern Europe nobody was more
Stalinist than Tito and Enver Hoxha.
But with Tito’s defection in 1948, the
Albanian position became difficult in the
extreme. She had an enemy against
her mountain border. Yet at the same
time the presence of Russian submarines
and warships in Albanian harbors was
a standing threat to Tito.
Worse was to follow. No doubt the
Albanians knew that before the quar-
rel with Tito, Stalin had cynically sug-
gested that the Yugoslavs might just as
well swallow up Albania. When Khrush-
chev made things up with Tito, the
Albanians found to their dismay that
the same line of thought might be
reborn.
Khrushchev showed himself capable
of consulting in secret with the arch-
revisionist Tito about the desirability of
putting down the arch-Stalinist Rakosi of
Hungary. If he could do this, he could
also connive at a coup to remove Hoxha
and perhaps subdue Albania to Yugoslav
influence. Indeed, there is a very strong
suspicion that just such a coup was in
fact planned—though whether Tito was
privy to it is not known.
So Hoxha has two good reasons for
exalting Stalin and Stalinist methods and
allying himself with China. It is only
through the most rigorous repression
that he can hope to control his own
wild and turbulent mountaineers. For
although the country is now over one-
and-a-half million strong, increasing at
the rate of over 3 per cent a year, and
although it is turning with surprising
rapidity from a poor agrarian land into
a semi-industrialised land, it is still not
an organised society as we understand
the term. On the other hand, it is only
with Chinese support that he can hope
to stand not only against Russia but
also against Yugoslavia.
Albania is more than a catspaw, how-
ever: for Khrushchev it is a trouble
centre in its own right. Through this
tiny country China has secured a foot-
hold in Europe; and, as centrifugal
forces make themselves increasingly
felt within the European Communist
bloc, relations between individual Com-
munist countries and Albania can com-
plicate the old stark simplicities and as-
sume a more than symbolic importance,
Thus, even now, Rumania, actively try-
ing to play off China against Russia in
its determination not to be swallowed
up by Comecon, is demonstrably dis-
playing a new-found affection for Al-
bania, Khrushchev’s bogy and Mao’s
first European satellite. (ofns)

The Unwanted
Field-Marshal
Okello's fading image
From a Special Correspondent
in Nairobi
Il/’ITHOUT his oversized black cap with
’ the white band, and wearing a suit,
instead of his black shirt and two pistols,
the self-styled Field-Marshal Okello of
Zanzibar appears just a young man with
a resonant voice and a big chip on his
shoulder. Shorn of the trappings of re-
volution, and seated in the drawing-
room atmosphere of a Nairobi hotel,
holding a Press conference, Okello’s
image as a cold, calculating revolution-
ary leader faded before an array of TV
cameras and newspaper correspondents.
To any Government wishing to con-
form to the minimum standards of inter-
national behavior, Okello is a decided
embarrassment, and he certainly proved
so in Zanzibar. It is widely believed
here that one of the main reasons for
the hesitancy shown by Britain and
America in extending formal recogni-
tion to the new Zanzibar regime was
because of Okello’s behavior. When
he left Zanzibar to visit relatives on the
mainland, recognition came swiftly, and
now it seems most unlikely that Okello
will resume his post as chairman of the
island’s Revolutionary Council. On his
return there, he was held at the airport
by security forces and then returned to
Dar-es-Salaam. He does not hold Zanzi-
bar citizenship.
Because he is believed to be looking
for fresh avenues to explore and another
opportunity to use his unique talents,
the mainland Governments in East
Africa have shown concern about his
movements. His methods of entering
both Kenya and Uganda last week gave
added cause for concern, as he displayed
little respect for the normal immigration
formalities, or the usual Government
contacts sought by VIPs.
Even the unflappable Mr Oginga
Odinga found it politic to issue a strong
denial, through one of his spokesmen,
that there had been any association be-
tween him and Okello. When Mr Toni
Mboya, Minister for Justice, rushed
through an urgent Bill to enable “unde-
sirables”, including Africans, to be de-
ported from Kenya with the minimum
of formalities, Parliament building was
alive with conjecture about Okello’s
future destination.
It proved to be Dar-es-Salaam, where
the Zanzibar “strong man” informed an
African newspaperman that he was not
Okello at all, but a Kenya citizen by
the name of Gideon Baker who had
never set eyes on Zanzibar in his life.

Around Melbourne
LET HANSARD CORRUPT YOUR CHILD!
IyfELBOURNE has been in a strange
state of mind over the last week
or two. Or, rather, there have been
some strange states of mind in Mel-
bourne. At the Scientology inquiry at
the National Herbarium ordinary-
looking citizens have sworn on the
Bible that they remember extra-
ordinary things. One chap took a
space flight lasting 6000 light-years
some forty-odd trillion years ago,
and another was the Mad Monk,
Rasputin.
Mr Kevin Anderson, QC, appro-
priately for a man sitting almost in
the middle of the Botanic Gardens,
has been receiving this rhubarb with
friendly composure. The scientolo-
gists seem to feel their affair is being
well handled, and, in confidence of
ultimate vindication, harbor no hard
feelings.
We cannot say that the same
simplicity and trust have marked the
controversy over Mary McCarthy’s
post-graduate study of the virgins of
Vassar. Our Melbourne air has been
filled with fire, fog and fury—just
when we’ve been having our summer,
too.
The individual with the greatest
role so far has been Mr Arthur
Gordon Rylah, the Chief Secretary
and Deputy Premier, who began the
battle calmly, advised us to forget the
whole thing, then grew crosser and
crosser, and finally appeared to do
his block on the floor of the Legis-
lative Assembly. He took to assailing
imagined conspirators; to issuing
statements to one paper while not to
another; and to talking about his
teenage daughter although she’s in her
twenties.
This is the first time Arthur Rylah
has been alone under the full blast of
a Press and public assault, and he
has shown that he doesn’t like it
much. We expect our politicians to
be tougher than that, especially when
they’ve been in office for more than
eight years.
He scored with one move. He read
bits of “The Group” to the House
after a bevy of teenage girls had been
ushered from the gallery. He got the
tough stuff into Hansard. The public,
including the teenage girls, can now
read officially what Mr Rylah and
Sergeant Mick Miller of the Vice
Squad believe is obscene detached
from the rest of the book, which may
or may not justify the sexual passages.
Perhaps the shops could now put
expurgated copies of the novel on the
market with a free bonus issue of
Hansard with each one. Perhaps
some silly fellow will care to com-
plain to a magistrate or two JPs that
Hansard has corrupted his child, a
person open to corruption.
Arthur Rylah, 54, is a solicitor,
the son of a solicitor who founded
the firm of Rylah and Rylah in Collins
Street. He went to Trinity College
and Melbourne University. He en-
listed as a gunner in the AIF in the
last war and served in New Guinea
and the Islands. He became member
for the Tory-toned electorate of Kew
in 1949, taking over from Wilfrid
Kent Hughes. He’s had his present
portfolios since 1955.
In 1937 he married Ann Flashman,
who is a veterinary and writer and
leading figure in Girl-Guiding. The
veterinary surgery is at the Rylah
home in Victor Street, Kew, and the
house often has a couple of score of
animals.
riIHE Rylahs have two children, Anna-
bel, who married recently, and
Michael. They have a country retreat
near Strathewan, about 30 miles out
of Melbourne, and not far from a
place called Arthur’s Creek, which is
not named after Arthur, although
there might be times when he feels
that he is well up it.
Arthur Rylah as a Minister is
popular with his department; he has
made a name for himself in prison
reform (not to the extent of abolish-
ing hanging, however) and in social
welfare. He and the Premier and a
couple of others make up 95 per cent
of the brain power and ability of the
Cabinet. In Parliament he is known
as “The Little Leader”, although no
one calls Henry Bolte “The Big
Leader”. He and Henry Bolte just
get along at times.
Arthur Rylah has a sensible attitude
to liquor reform, and initiated the
present Royal Commission into the
drink trade that Mr P. D. Phillips,
QC, is conducting.
He enjoys tennis and racing. He’s
a well-read fellow, as we come in
Melbourne. Strange to relate, he even
has an “open mind”, as he has put it,
on the obscenity of “The Group”,
although he supported the decision
that the booksellers should be asked
to withdraw it from the shelves.
This sort of thing may betoken a
certain conflict in Arthur Rylah,
between his private self and the
ambitious politician. After all, he has
to keep a close eye on the ladies of
the Kew electorate, who include such
figures as Olive Allison, wife of busi-
ness magnate Sir John Allison. Lady
Allison, in a letter to the “Age”,
said “The Group” should be burned
and the blurb writer punished for
sacrilege. Both Mr Bolte and Arthur
Rylah are conscious of the women’s
vote and of female influence in the
Liberal and Country Party. It affects
their policy on hanging as. much as
on obscenity allegations.
As he spars on in “The Group”
controversy, Arthur Rylah is probably
as annoyed by what has been dis-
closed about police methods as much
as anything else. Many people who
do not mind a good prosecution still
don’t like behind-the-counter arrange-
ments for taking books out of sight.
Many people are also disturbed at
another revelation of our Chief Sec-
retary’s mind. He has told the House
that the police have dossiers on all
Reds and fellow travellers, quite
apart from the Security Service
dossiers. Is political work a State
police matter? And who are classed
as fellow travellers?
This is a reminder that Arthur
Rylah, while not by any means among
the wild McCarthyites (either Mary
or Joe) of our State, is perhaps over-
apprehensive of the possibility of Red
revolution as well as of the effects of
literature in society.

DISCONTENT IN THE SERVICES
Sir,
In October, 1963, my husband applied
for a discharge from the Regular Army
on grounds of financial difficulty and
had it turned down. The request has
once again been denied. However, the
substitute offered was the opportunity,
the first in almost two years of service,
to take a trade test which, if successful,
would increase his rank from Private
Group 1 to Private Group 3, and his
salary by approximately 255. a week.
This increase, though not sufficient to
cover our debts, was better than nothing,
so he took the opportunity and passed
the test with 77%. He is still waiting
for his rise. What civilian firm would
bribe an employee in this way and then
keep him waiting over four months
before the promise is fulfilled?
This is only the latest of many such
disappointments my husband and I have
suffered during the course of his 23
months’ service with the Army. He was
once an enthusiastic young soldier; now
he is disillusioned, depressed and wants
only a discharge to enable him to enjoy
the rights of a citizen of a free country
once again.

Sir,
Unlike “Another RAAF Officer”
(14/3/64), I believe that there has been
a definite decline in RAAF morale over
the past few months. Once a clear
picture of the “DFRB Racket” was pre-
sented in the “Critical Group-Captain’s
paper” (22/2/64), the morale of all
RAAF members fell. Apparently in an
attempt to restore morale, the RAAF
representative on the Defence Forces
Retirement Benefit Board was sent to
RAAF units to present the unpopular
superannuation scheme in a kinder
light. This mission failed, partly be-
cause he could not explain why many
of the anomalies had occurred, and
partly because he freely admitted that
there were many parts of the DFRB
Act that he himself could not follow.
He also admitted to the gathering at-
tended by my husband that he “only
spent ten minutes a day on DFRB”.
In addition, the morale of profes-
sionally qualified officers was under-
mined by a letter from the Department
of Air, signed by a member of the Air
Board, explaining the alleged problems
which had to be overcome by the Air
Board before the higher rates of pay
granted to civilian engineers by the
1961 Award could be paid to RAAF
engineers. This letter was written, no
doubt, in an attempt to justify the Air
Board’s failure to reach a decision
during the previous 2+ years. Any
person with any slight connection with
the RAAF knows that there are no valid
reasons for the failure to pay a profes-
sional allowance to RAAF engineers.
“Another RAAF Officer” implies
that an Air Force technical officer
should not receive a professionals allow-
ance because he has obtained his quali-
fications at RAAF expense. Why, then,
are the aircrew, dentists, and doctors,
who have obtained professional quali-
fications at RAAF expense, paid a
handsome allowance?
“MY HUSBAND'S ADVICARE”

Melbourne (Vic.).
Sir,
I think the biggest injustice of the
Defence Forces Retirement Benefit Fund
has been overlooked by your corre-
spondents. This is the fact that it is
compulsory for all regular members of
the Forces to contribute to it, and yet
they have no say in it. Should a Service
officer pull out with less than 20 years’
service he is eligible for only a refund
of contributions, although the Fund has
been using them to gain interest through-
out his service.
Whilst officers of fighting units must
retire at 47, those of the supporting
Services have to serve until 55 to get
their pension. The sum an officer re-
tiring at 55 would forfeit in pension
would be very considerable. Add to
this the rate of contribution to the fund
he would be paying for the eight years,
and it can be seen that the advantage
is with the officer who retires earlier.
The small increase in pension for those
extra years could in no way balance the
financial loss involved.
The stipulation that a member “may
be requested to serve on the reserve” to
get his gratuity makes the Act an exten-
sion of Army Orders.
My contention is that a member of
the Services should have the right not
to be a contributor to the fund, and
should a present contributor wish to
withdraw from the Fund he should be
repaid his contributions together with a
pro-rata gratuity or the compound
interest that his contributions have
earned.

Sir,
I have been reading with interest the
letters to the Editor by Service officers,
and note that none. has been prepared
to give his name. I can only assume
that these men fear victimisation for
having the intestinal fortitude to tell the
generally poorly informed (on defence
matters) public that all is not well in the
Armed Forces.
I commend The Bulletin for the
stand it has taken in this matter and
will be most interested to see how our
three Service Ministers handle this situ-
ation will they attempt to persuade
Cabinet that these men are right and
that something obviously must be done
to better conditions of employment, or
will they adopt a head-in-the-sand atti-
tude and attempt to stifle the discon-
tent by instructing the Service chiefs to
punish dissident officers who have voiced
their thoughts?

COMMUNISM IN INDONESIA
Sir,
Professor Legge seems to agree with
me now that the Indonesian Communist
Party is a real Communist party and
powerful. This was not evident from
his original article and subsequent letters.
I wonder whether he also agrees now
that the PKI is growing.
Professor Legge also now admits
Soviet military presence in Indonesia.
His statement that it “does not neces-
sarily mean a Cuba-type of commitment”
is, of course, true and platitudinous: we
are living in a contingent world in which
almost anything may happen. The pro-
bability that Indonesia may develop
along Cuban lines is considerable.
I did not quote Dr Hindley to support
my interpretations, but merely as a
reputable source of empirical evidence.
I agree, of course, that vigilance must
be combined with readiness to negotiate.
But this does not imply softness towards
blackmail and treachery towards allies.
At the present time Australia can do
very little, since we lack military'power,
without which diplomacy must be
spurious. The paramount task is to
create a “defence-minded” climate of
public opinion and increase our defence
forces. So far, the contributions of
neutralist academics have tended to
strengthen the forces of capitulation by
minimising or obscuring the perils in our
vicinity.

WOOL AND RED CHINA
Sir,
Sir William Gunn has returned from
Peking with the statement that he has
been engaged in international trade, not
politics. It will be recalled that an earlier
visit was postponed indefinitely because
Red China chose that particular time to
launch an unprovoked military attack on
India. No doubt that occasion was
highly embarrassing to the International
Wool Secretariat. Now that the dust


has settled a bit, however, it has tried
again, apparently in the naive belief that
leopards do change their spots, and that
a short-term boost to the wool market is
worth the risk of a not-so-long-term
take-over in the political sphere, when
we could lose the lot.
About 30 years ago a paranoiac
named Hitler wrote a book outlining a
fantastic scheme of national self-
aggrandisement. Now Chairman Mao
has also written a book; and whole-
heartedly he supports others who have
written similar books, including Lenin,
who predicted that “when the capitalist
world begins to seek our trade, they will
finance their own destruction.”
Chairman Mao, being of the opinion
that any stick is good enough to beat
a dog, and being equally clear as to the
interaction of trade and politics, was of
course much too tactful to draw the
attention of the IWS to such things.
Instead, with infinite Oriental charm,
he conjured up a quantity of wool and
instructed his henchmen to pull it gently
over the eyes of Sir William Gunn.
The needs of Communist countries
for wool should be met in the usual
course of trade, with the reservation that
wool promotion in such countries is a
sheer waste of money.
Where Red China is concerned, trade
and politics are inextricably entwined,
and even the chairman of IWS cannot
unravel them. He should abandon the
attempt, and continue to investigate
ways of developing wool markets
amongst the 430 millions in India,
giving that country top priority in the
field of technical assistance.
A. L. WALKER

Sir,
As a result of Sir William Gunn’s
Peking visit we woolgrowers find our-
selves in the same category as the water-
side workers in that we both have to con-
tribute to the building up and advance-
ment of Communism through a com-
pulsory levy on our earnings; the wool-
growers’ contribution is subsidised by
the taxpayer.
In view of the proposal to use wool
industry and Commonwealth Govern-
ment funds to provide economic aid to
Communist China, how can Sir William
Gunn claim that his proposals are just
a private business deal? And how can
his actions amount to a private business
deal? Sir William is not a wool buyer,
neither is the Wool Board.
Sir William claims not to have made
contact with his friends in Peking at
Government level. This statement is
false and misleading, and it is incredible
that Sir William does not realise this.
Surely he cannot claim that private
enterprise flourishes in the Forbidden
City? The agency he dealt with is a
Government agency. If everything is
so aboveboard, why is it necessary to
deceive the Australian public?

AUSTRALIAN HISTORY
Sir,
Relative to my letter headed “Aus-
tralian History” (7/3/64), a much more
important matter than the opinion of
Mr M. H. Ellis —or anyone else
regarding the first flag-site is a question
involving editorial ethics.
Although the Royal Australian
Historical Society is just as accessible
to The Bulletin as is Mr Ellis, it was
not invited to add a comment to his
vicious and jumbled attack upon it
(15/2/64), but when I replied to that
attack he was allowed to attach a foot-
note to my letter. Such a procedure
strikes me as being quite lopsided.
For the rest, I desire only to say that
the “numerous errors” which the foot-
note ascribes to certain members of the
RAHS are not nearly as numerous as
those which Mr Ellis himself has
achieved from time to time.
“Only” (see above) is written
advisedly, for I do not propose to pursue
this discussion. As far as I am con-
cerned, Mr Ellis can have the subject
of “errors’’ — his or others' —all to him-
self, and can continue, on the historical
front, to stew in his own peculiar juice.

EICHMANN
Sir,
Those advocating the complete and
absolute ban of “Lolita” may rejoice now
that they hear from Dr F. Knopfel-
macher (7/3/64) that Eichmann “ex-
pressed shock and dismay at the book”
when an Israeli guard gave him a copy
of it. Eichmann’s reaction is doubly
important since, so we hear from that
book review, he was not a freak, God
forbid a monster, but rather the very
sort of person whose judgment is sought
after in this censorship issue: “an
ordinary, very conventional, slightly
shoddy semi-intellectual in pursuit of a
job and in search of prestige, with senti-
mental attachments to Franz Josef and
“gay Austria . .
This is, of course, only a side-effect
of Arendt's-Knopfelmacher’s submissions
and an unintended and unforesee-
able one, maybe. But it throws light
—or, rather, darkness —upon the sort of
“evidence” which one writer adduces
and the other adopts in trying to con-
vince the reader that Eichmann “was
not a monster . . . (was) averse to
cruelty and emotionally not involved in
anti-Semitism . . . (and) despised rabid,
emotive Jew-baiters . .
True, Eichmann did not look like a
monster. This was my and probably
everybody’s surprise and to some extent
disappointment when I saw him sitting
there within the glass; although there
was something inhuman and therefore
monstrous in the very fact that not even
once during the long trial did he turn
his face towards the audience. Had he
done so he would have certainly met the
understanding—almost forgiving—eyes of
a-n American journalist, but, alas, he did
not know it. In all other relevant
aspects he proved himself to be a savage
killer, and not just that innocent and
ignorant “transportation officer”, that
false image which he was trying so hard
to create.
This is no place to indulge in a factual
analysis of the case. A whole book
might be needed for that task. And
actually the book exists already and Dr
K. can avail himself of it if he is really
interested in the facts: it is nothing else
but the full typescript (in English) of the
trial, including both judgments of the
District and Supreme Courts. Suffice it
here to say that it is quite inconceivable
that any intelligent, open-minded and
honest person who is familiar with the
evidence and the judgments could think
that Eichmann was “averse to cruelty.”
Eichmann might have been fastidious,
himself not being able to kill (thus
following the even more striking para-
dox of many SS “manual” killers who
could not see a cat hungry), but surely
he did his best, and more than that, to
ascertain that greater, always greater,
numbers of Jews would be liquidated.
So insatiable was his thirst for Jewish
blood that on several occasions his
superiors had to slow him down a little.
Indeed, one need not indulge in any
factual discussion since, in the writers’
view, the whole trial from its very begin-
ning was lacking in sincerity, it being
intended and designed by Mr Ben-
Gurion to use it “as a platform for
transacting Israel's quarrels with the
Arabs”. This is, to put it squarely, a
blatant lie, but of course as with all
lies regarding intentions, its exposition
is difficult and almost impossible. May
I only say that exactly such was the
claim of the Arab countries which, in-
cidentally, helped Hitler, hailed and hail
him to date and regard the massacre of
six million Jews as “a Jewish hoax”. So
the writer and the reviewer are in good
company.

URQUHART OF THE NMP
Sir,
In his review of “A Thousand Miles
Away, a History of North Queensland”
(7/3/64), in his list of noted omissions
why does M. H. Ellis give pride of place
to “men such as F. C. Urquhart of the
Black Police”? Presumably Mr Ellis
is referring to the Native Mounted
Police.
Urquhart left the NMP late in ’96 or
early in ’97 to go to the CIB, Brisbane.
He was then a very junior inspector with
a number of officers of senior rank,
greater experience and achievement in
the NMP, all of whom lacked good
Press agents or any political pull.

“\F IGHT on ® ald Mountain” is the
Guild's third Patrick White pre-
miere, following “The Ham Funeral”
and “The Season at Sarsaparilla”. All
three have been produced by John
Tasker.
The curtain rises on the shack of
Miss Quodling, the goatkeeper, on Bald
Mountain. In the dawn light this extra-
ordinarily ramshackle structure, made
of old palings, rusty iron and tattered
hessian, has a surprising beauty. The
biblical simplicity of the setting (de-
signed by Wendy Dickson) is matched
by Miss Quodling herself who is busy
milking her goats, alternately cursing
and wooing them before she sets them
free to leap about the mountainside.
Having escaped from suburban stuffi-
ness many years ago, she has found
peace and self-sufficiency on Bald
Mountain. She delights in the harsh
freedom of her life among the rocks
which are like iron on frosty nights,
the spindly scrub and the thin soil which
produces only runty apples and sour
apricots.
Miss Quodling does not “go nap on
human beings”, but she is kept closely in
touch with the natural rhythms of life
by her goats. Her colorful, down-to-
earth speech reveals Patrick White’s
wonderful ear for dialogue. The play
begins and ends with Miss Quodling
talking to herself and to her goats.
The scene moves, or rather revolves,
from Miss Quodling's shack to the big
house up the hill. By contrast with
Miss Quodling, who is tough, sane and
good, the inhabitants of the big house
have crippled spirits. Hugo Sword,
Professor of English, is egotistical, con-
stricted, afraid of the flesh, while his
wife Miriam is a dipsomaniac. Into
this unhappy household has come Stella
Summerhayes, a 30-year-old nurse, to
look after Mrs Sword.
The development of the action is
melodramatic. Professor Sword, who
has always been repelled by his wife’s
sensuality and who has had no physical
relationship with her for years, is attract-
ed by the purity and innocence of Stella
and almost rapes her. During this en-
counter, Stella discovers that she is at-
tracted by Sword, only to become aware,
brutally prompted by him, that it is
‘because he resembles her father, whom
she worships. Appalled, she throws her-
self over the cliff.
conclusion of the play seems to be
that happy personal relationships,
especially sexual relationships, are im-
possible to achieve. Miss Quodling is
self-sufficient and has avoided the pro-
blem except insofar as her goats are
concerned. For the purpose of breed-
ing she has to keep a buck, Samson,
locked up in a yard separate from the
does. She explains that she “never went
nap on the bucks” and she regards
Samson as a necessary evil. But, apart
from the fact that he stamps and shakes
the fence and once gets out and threat-
ens Mrs Sword’s roses, Samson is not
a major problem.
But Hugo and Miriam Sword and
Stella Summerhayes are all defeated by
their own sexuality. The dramatist lays
all the blame for the destruction of the
two women on the shoulders of Hugo
Sword. But this ageing Professor, an
uncreative poet who produces only “dry
sticks”, does not fill the role of devil
incarnate very convincingly. Miss Quod-
ling says of Stella that she was “too
good” and that “they” destroyed her.
But perhaps she was too innocent.
Similarly, it does not seem credible, in
a realistic play, that all the fault for the
failure of a marriage should lie on one
side. Yet Miriam is presented in an
entirely sympathetic and Hugo in a
completely unsympathetic light. I found
it impossible to really believe in, or be
moved by, the events involving these
characters. It seemed much more up-
setting when Miss Quodling’s favorite
goat, Dolores, leapt off the cliff than
when Stella did so. Miss Quodling is
so much more real than the other
characters. It is the poetry of her life
amid rocks, goats and silence that gives
the play depth and, in spite of the melo-
dramatic events, serenity.
Nita Panned is Miss Quodling just as
she was Miss Docker in “A Cheery
Soul”. A shapeless figure in her layers
of ancient garments, heavy in her move-
ments although quick in her perceptions,
Nita Pannell's Miss Quodling plods
about with the cheerful patience of one
who enjoys life in a hard world, but
takes it all liberally sprinkled with salt.
With the other characters it is diffi-
cult to sort out what is unconvincing in
the characterisation from what is uncer-
tain in John Tasker's production or dis-
torted in the acting. Although Miriam
describes her husband as “handsome”
and “a god”, Alexander Archdale plays
Hugo Sword as pettish, and, in the all-
important bedroom scene with Stella,
painfully absurd. With such a Hugo,
the role of Miriam and Stella are more
difficult. Joan Bruce as a red-haired,
histrionic Miriam is very good when she
is getting drunk. Myra Noblet manages
well the minor role of Mrs Sibley, the
housekeeper, who is the exact opposite
of Miss Quodling: timid, conventional
and longing for cosiness.
Although it is a “fringe” production,
neither sanctioned nor subsidised by the
Festival Committee, “Night on Bald
Mountain"’ is the major dramatic event
of the Festival.
“Macbeth in Camera” is a dramatised
argument between a young lecturer in
English literature who is organising a
provincial festival and a small company
of actors who are rehearsing “Scenes
from Macbeth” for this festival. Written
and directed by Harold Lang, who also
acts the part of the Producer, this is
based on an actual argument which took
place in an English provincial town.
Visiting the rehearsal, the lecturer is
horrified to discover that the actors are
not speaking Shakespeare’s words but
their own. When he threatens to sack
them, the producer and actors try to
convince him that staging a Shakespeare
play is not simply a matter of speaking
the poet’s immortal lines with reverent
feelings. They explain that they are
paraphrasing in order to make sure they
understand Shakespeare’s meaning and
to fit the action to the words.
As an argument against the extreme
“armchair”’or “immortal bard” approach
to Shakespeare, this is cleverly con


structed, cogently reasoned and very
amusing. As a demonstration of the
effectiveness of the paraphrase method
for illuminating difficult passages, the
imaginary rehearsal of the “England”
scene with Malcolm and Macduff is
quite dazzling.
I found this brilliant lesson in theatri-
cal methods far more stimulating than
many Shakespearean productions I have
seen.
The Flinders Street Revue Company
has contributed a lively and polished
revue to the Festival “fringe” with “On
the Fringe ’64”. Many of the sketches
lightly satirise the Festival which every-
one is happy to laugh at because they
are enjoying it so much, in this city
where the sun shines every day. In a
pleasant skit on the Beatles, the four
Cockroaches sing a song with the refrain
“You haven't lived until you’ve drowned
yourself”. Three Australian Mums —
Mrs White, Mrs Nolan and Mrs Help-
mann—lament their un-Australian sons,
while Mrs Hoad praises her very Aus-
tralian boy. I also liked a parody on
a song from a popular musical entitled
“Costalot” which is sung by Daphne
Kirkland.
LETTER FROM LONDON
Barnstormer
The Tower. Hal Porter. Hampstead
Theatre Club, London.
TTal Porter’s play “The Tower”, ori-
ginally commissioned by the Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust and published last
year in the Penguin “Three Australian
Plays”, has been given a first perform-
ance by the Hampstead Theatre Club in
London. The premises of the club are
a newly built small theatre in one of the
outer suburbs, with a capacity of about
200. Any seat in the auditorium is
thus intimately close to the performers,
a situation particularly suitable for Mr
Porter’s play, concerned as it is with the
clash of wills in a colonial family.
The play is set in Hobart in 1850. A
ruthless, assertive merchant, Sir Rodney
Havilland, murders his step-daughter in
order to safeguard his prospects for ad-
vancement in the colony, since they were
threatened by her affair with his con-
vict steward. The murder is witnessed
Jjay Edwin, the steward's son whom
Havilland adopted as a baby. The boy in
conjunction with his real father, uses
the knowledge to make Havilland sub-
mit to his will.
This is a plot which surely demands
concentrated development, especially if
the stark ending, with Edwin forcing
Havilland to admit his subjugation, is to
be justified (the inevitable comparison
is with the Losey-Pinter film “The Ser-
vant”, still showing in London).
But the play is in fact overloaded
with what, on the stage, are seen to be
side issues. These other issues may deal
also with the struggle for self-assertion
Havilland's new wife wants to change
purple lilac for the white; the step-daugh-
ter, one suspects, becomes the steward’s
lover mainly to thwart her father
nevertheless they blur the central struggle
and it is not until the last act that the
play moves in a definite direction. The
third act’s concentration, compared to
the first two, unhappily makes it seem
melodramatic.
The principal role is that of Edwin,,an
expert study in sinister precociousness.
But this is precisely the role which must
be most difficult to fill, requiring a 14-
year-old boy with the cunning and hypo-
crisy of Iago; and the production failed,
almost inevitably for me, because the lad
chosen was so inadequate.
Giving his first professional perform-
ance, he was just not up to it nor
was he helped by direction which obliged
him to shriek one of his most awkward
lines standing on a chair.
The rest of the cast was convincing,
if not always word perfect. In particular
I admired Peter Eyre, who put consider-
able life into the role of the suitor, com-
bining severe diffidence with epileptic
outbursts of violence.
This production then pitilessly exposed
the play's weaknesses (such as the crude
use of sound thunder and lightning
at the “right” moments and odd, inter-
mittent bursts of seagull cries). It also
revealed some effectively dramatic
writing (for example Edwin's witnessing
of the offstage murder, though it was
unimaginatively staged). Mr Porter’s
next play should be very interesting.

pany. VAYC Hall, Melbourne.
was a struggle with “Twelfth
"*■ Night”, rather than a production of
it. Although almost everyone concerned
scored points for some felicitous touch
or other, and a few of the performances
were notably good, the over-all result
was never in doubt nobody won, and
Shakespeare came last. In a way, this
seems an appropriate thing to have hap-
pened in Melbourne during Moomba.
The root of the trouble lay in the fact
that the producer, George Dixon, was
also one of the principal players. If
ever an actor needed a producer’s help
in calculating his effects, it was Mr Dixon
as Feste; his movements were awkward,
and his fixed esoteric smile conveyed
the unfortunate impression that he
thought he knew the secret of the part,
but was unwilling to commit himself too
far in case he was wrong. And it was
clear that no steady producer’s-eye-view
had been taken of the play as a whole;
this was very much a one-scene-at-a-time
production, with unnecessarily long pa-us-
es in between, and little or no sense of
development. Mr Dixon may have had
solutions in mind for the play’s notorious
problems of balance; if he did, he failed
to articulate them.
The performance I saw was marred by
a number of mistakes on stage, and by
very poor lighting; when the lights did
eventually come on, they were frequently
focused on the wrong part of the stage.
On the whole, the text was well-spoken.
Lola Russell, as Viola, was sensitive and
intelligent, but somewhat staid. Neville
Thurgood brought Sir Toby Belch vigor-
ously to life, and lan Harrison and Joan
McGrory managed rather well as Orsino
and Olivia.

Jam Session
Eddie Condon and his American Jazz
Stars. Festival Hall, Melbourne.
"Teamed for his off-beat witticisms,
liquor capacity (his hangover cure:
“Take the juice of one quart of whisky”),
and New York night club, guitarist
Eddie Condon has been associated with
“Chicago-style” jazz since the ’Twenties.
Considering his doctor’s warning that to
attempt this tour was to commit suicide,
his agile-fingered performance (although
barely audible) and his laconic commen-
tating were little short of heroic.
The personnel of this unclassifiable
band (they fall squarely between the
Trad and Modern fashions of the
moment) is: Buck Clayton, trumpet; Pee
Wee Russell, clarinet; Bud Freeman,
tenor sax; Vic Dickenson, trombone;
Jimmy Rushing, vocals; Dick Cary,
piano; Jack Lesberg, bass; and Cliff
Leeman, drums.
With a group of individualists such
as this the inevitable method of presen-
tation was that of the jam-session: an
ensemble statement of the melody, solo
choruses by each musician, and a
climaxing ensemble. The talents of the
front-line men were further show-cased
by feature numbers and these were
amongst the most rewarding moments of
the concert.
Pee Wee Russell in his two solo fea-
tures demonstrated why he is known as
the eccentric poet of the clarinet. The
sensitivity and suspense of his “Pee
Wee’s Blues” held the audience enthral-
led. Associated with Russell since the
early days and not unlike him in his
individual approach is Bud Freeman
who, with his alternately tender and
explosive style, combined uncanny

Freeman, in conversation, showed him-
self to be erudite, eager to talk, a-nd
impressed by Australia and the Austra-
lians, who he considers the politest people
in the world!
Trumpeter Buck Clayton (like Vic
Dickenson and Jimmy Rushing) is a free-
lancing ex-member of the Count Basie
orchestra. Always considered a most in-
ventive and melodic improviser, his
concert performance displayed a fierce
brilliance of tone and execution not
apparent on all his records. Dickenson,
despite an occasional disconcerting
jerkiness in his phrasing, is a lyrical and
wryly humorous trombonist. An exotic
addition to the brass on several numbers
(notably Ellington's “Caravan’’) was the
alto horn (or E-flat bedpan as Condon
called it) of pianist Dick Cary. Cary's
piano, both during solos and when work-
ing with the rhythm section, was invari-
ably tasteful and showed a rich musical
imagination.
Lesberg and Leeman worked w j ell to-
gether to provide a swinging beat which
was an object lesson to local musicians.
By the time Jimmy Rushing (a Negro of
alarming proportions) was offered as the
piece de resistance, one could scarcely
object to the five numbers devoted to his
lusty, frog-toned, blues-tinged vocalisms.
These top-drawer, if unfashionable,
jazzmen w'ere unanimous in their dis-
satisfaction with the American jazz
scene. Bud Freeman described it as a rat-
race infested with gimmicks. By re-
fusing to compromise, all these musi-
cians have endured periods of hardship.
Dick Cary said that the situation in Los
Angeles was so bad that, on completion
of the tour (which is to include New
Zealand and Japan), he intends to settle
in Sydney.

FILMS
Trial of Strength
A Knife in the Water. Director,
Roman Polanski. Savoy Theatre,
Sydney. i
HPo most people, the Polish cinema
means Andrzej Wajda, director of
the celebrated war trilogy “A Genera-
tion”, “Kanal”, and “Ashes and Dia-
monds". But Wajda is only one figure
in a national cinema that appears, even
on the insufficient evidence available to
us here, vital and inventive, ranging
from the toughness of Aleksander Ford’s
“Five Boys from Barska Street”, through
the zany humor of Chmielewski’s “Eva
Wants to Sleep”, to the shattering disil-
lusionment of Kawalerowicz's “Mother
Joan of the Angels”, seen briefly in Syd-
ney last year.
Roman Polanski's “A Knife in the
Water”, originally reviewed from Perth,
is a very stylish film, bearing the stamp
of a highly personal intelligence. A
successful writer and his handsome wife,
on their way to spend a Sunday aboard
their yacht, pick up a young hitch-hiker
and casually invite him to go along. The
two men instinctively resent each other
the boy is humiliated by the man's
expertise, the man envies the boy’s
youth and they embark on a sort of
trial of strength before the woman, who
watches their bantam-cock struttings
with contemptuous indifference. The
ironical conclusion is startling but in-
evitable.
Polanski's film is clear-sighted and
unemotional. His observation is totally
without moral bias. The film offers an
unusual consistency of mood and eco-
nomy of construction, underlined by the
use of uncluttered black-and-white
photography and natural sound.

Rebels and Reactionaries
Conflicting themes of 20th century fiction
By DAVID MARTIN
The Modern Novel. Paul West. Hut-
chinson. 755. 6d.
fFiiis is a book to embarrass the hardiest
reviewer. He comes in at second
remove, being called upon to criticise the
critic. There is something appallingly
unreal about such a task. When he has
to deal with a practitioner like Paul West,
who seems to have read all the novels
of all the major literatures of Europe in
the original, you should pity him. How
is he to extract a leitmotive from such
a barrel of facts and opinions, having to
admit, with many blushes, that he is
familiar with only a fraction of these
works? The best would be to ask Paul
West to review himself except that
then there would be no leitmotive at all.
That’s the trouble with this opus —-
this outsize Ph.D. thesis. Mr West starts
off with an excellent idea: a sweeping
analysis of the whole range of modern
fiction, to see where it has got to between
the poles of documentary and psycho-
logical reality, but he knows far too much
to stick to the point. This is sad, be-
cause the exploration is overdue. How
stimulating could it have been to Aus-
tralians, whose contemporary literature
is bedevilled by this very problem, a
wing of documentary realism and a wing
of subjective “stream”, with practically
nothing in the middle! But there is no
debate —how could there be in such a
welter? —and Paul West has overlooked
us here. Henry Handel Richardson gets
one line to Dorothy Richardson’s long
pages; Patrick White and Martin Boyd
do not appear at all, and yet these two
would have illustrated his argument
extremely well.
The author mocks up a few bold
generalisations. The English novel (he
says) is handicapped by excessive con-
cern with class distinctions, from worm’s-
to bird’s-eye views; the Americans try
to create a Summa of their society by
documenting massively or resorting to
myth; the French try to eliminate
psychology by cataloguing the external
world; the Italians fight a tradition of
ermetismo by an almost over-compen-
satory verismo, whereas the West Ger-
mans counter painful recollections by
turning to Parnassianism and fantasy.
The Spanish novel goes towards an
exercise in surfaces which throws the
burden of interpretation on the spectator,
and the Russian well, the Russian is
dead, except for “Abram Tertz” and
Pasternak.
The largest section is dedicated to the
English novel. It is also the most annoy-
ing. To bring about some continuity
from writer to writer, Paul West
meanders down countless side streets,
creating artificial links between such un-
likely companions as D. H. Lawrence
and May Sinclair or Dorothy Richard-
son and Doris Lessing. The former
“emancipates consciousness from time”
and the latter “judges and chooses the
light her people will appear in.” How,
we used to ask at school, did the cow
get on to the roof? Alas, these invalid
comparisons lead to queer misunder-
standings. We are told that Doris Less-
ing’s “The Golden Notebook” suffocates
us with information about its double
heroine, and this harks back to the
author's useful thesis that an almost
unbridgeable gulf now looms between the
novel of metaphysical defiance and the
novel of social observation. But Miss
Lessing is interesting precisely because
she tries to bridge the gulf, and since her
split heroine represents almost the first
conscious attempt in the new fiction to
operate on both levels, the subjective-
romantic and the realistic-objective, the
criticism is misdirected. She ought to
have been dealt with in a different and
broader context, perhaps in juxtaposition
with Simone de Beauvoir: at least both
probe a similar dilemma.
are legions of such overstrained
and thrown-away comparisons, most
regrettably because Paul West can also
be illuminating. Though opinionated to
a degree, his opinions are frequently
original and demand attention. One
would like to send him back to his tre-
mendous filing cabinet, with a request
to dig out half a dozen or so important
novelists, do them over thoroughly and
allow us to see the trees in the wood.
That way we might judge whether the
abstract and social view of man can be
brought back into proportion with the
stream of consciousness. Less history
would have produced more truth.
On individual writers “The Modern
Novel” is often very good. On C. P.
Snow, for instance. (“He may at times
seem to be fondling the notion of power
in much the same voluptuous way as
Camus fondles the idea of justice.”)
Worth saying, but why add, “his novels
have so far shown little awareness of the
religious side of man”? Paul West
appears to think that this unawareness
is a fundamental weakness of the modem
novel. As to Snow, the simple and crude
answer is that he is just not that kind
of writer. Or is Mr West throwing out
a hint for someone to write a post-
graduate essay on “The Absence of the
Religious Element in C. P. Snow”? But
maybe the author is probably seeking to
prove that, nowadays, the classical
approach by-passes inner reality as much
as does the type of novel which Snow
himself has often debunked, and which
strives for cosmic insight by fragmenting
man in his kaleidoscopic environment.
The one catches only a mirror reflection
of attitudes, the other dissolves reality in
a vain endeavor to reproduce it in toto.
“The novel, I believe, must fuse as
many views of man as possible; and
such a fusion is most feasible in the
manner of the roman-fleuve as handled
(although not with constant success) by
Proust and Lawrence Durrell,” West
says in his introduction. Later, he notes
Durrell’s problem. “His writing is too
brilliant . . . Against his magnificent
tapestries plain language looks like
ivory.” True again, but if Durrell, too,
“blurs and dissolves” the novel as,
according to this study, Robbe-Grillet,
Faulkner, JLinger, Malaparte, Bely and
Baroja do or did in their countries, where
is the re-integration? What, particularly,
becomes of the claim that “structure has
been brought back to help create
suggestive patterns” in the English novel?
Where has this happened? There is a
contradiction, and in fact there is no
re-integration. To many it would seem
that the prongs continue to diverge. The
extremes may meet somewhere: in the
no-man's land between the stream (“the
least disciplined form of romantic
poetry”) and the aridity of Huxley
between the desire to leave nothing out
and the determination to embody man
as idea, sense and sensibility are mutually
abolished.
Unfortunately, Paul West hardly looks
for the reasons. He does not suggest
that both tendencies are trying to escape
from the same impasse and, dialectically,
for identical reasons. To him, the way
forward is still lit by Dostoevsky’s
torch. A realisation of the eclecticism
of art underlies his thinking, but because
he is the greatest eclectic of them all,
he leaves the situation more confused
than he found it. I believe the finest
writers today have a clearer grasp of
the problem than he has. The truth is
glimpsed in an aside of Carlo Levi (“we
are obliged to interpret Italian realism
as a religious metaphor”). I don’t know
about that, but novelists like Levi are
certainly trying to merge the concentric


circles that, in fiction, isolate social from
“private” and spiritual man. In the end
every writer wants to do that, and the
most useful question to ask is not, ad
infinitum, how do they fail? But why
do they fail? Only thus can the critic
justify his existence.
If this sounds as if “The Modern
Novel” is not worth reading, I am sorry.
Everybody should read it who considers
he has the necessary staying-power, for
the intelligent interpretations it contains,
far outnumbering the clever gaucheries.
Paul West is at his best in laying bare
a writer's basic defect. (“Lawrence failed
to realise that myth expounds itself and
needs little commentary.”) He is at his
worst when raising “pregnant” issues,
only to produce this sort of miscarriage:
“Anyone who contends . . . that the
French novel has fallen a victim to
abstraction, should try to explain the
neglect of Anatole France.” The Ger-
mans would say “er quatscht wie ein
Entenpopo” —he quacks like a duck’s
bottom. As I tried to show, he doesn't
always do this. Item, his chapter on
France, with its splendid pieces on Rol-
land, Romains, Roger Martin du Garde
and. above all. Camus. (“A feeble sense
of social structure.”)
Indeed, all the foreign sections are
better, because more selective, than the
English, though this does not quite hold
for the American, divided into “A
Mystique of Documentary” and “Time,
South and Identity.” The chapter on
the Russians is debilitated by the usual
absolute refusal to meet them on their
own terms and, at one point, made
ludicrous by Mr West's courage in re-
writing a nature passage from Sholokhov.
The German part gives too much space
to second and third rankers at the expense
of outstanding figures like Doblin and
Musil, but it is strong on the central
preoccupations of German fiction since
before the war. The Italian is, I should
say, the best; if only because it sets the
later Silone, as well as Moravia and di
Lampedusa, in their proper perspective.
Finally, there is a succinct and empathe-
tic envoi on Spain, whose literature is
gradually emerging from the neglect it
has suffered outside, and also partly
inside, its own country. To see a lance
broken for Ramon Sender is very
pleasing.
To quote from the blurb, “by com-
paring the twin extremes of the flux
novel and the novel of the choistes, the
author hopes to suggest that there are
certain things the novel cannot attempt
without repudiating the whole idea of
art as a deliberate artifice.” Well roared!
The novel that tries to be fife destroys
itself. It only remains to say that the
critic of the novel can fall into the same
trap. By embracing too much he can
lose the essence.

Oacred or profane, love makes the
world go round, and some fall off,
as innumerable authors have demonstra-
ted. Three of its latest fictional victims
are Paul Danner, threatened with the
electric chair for rape in “Without Con-
sent”, Antonia Mount the headmistress
with an eye for the bosoms of her girls
in “The Finishing Touch”, and Richard
Dalleau the Parisian whose experiences
are those of a young man with normal
personal difficulties made worse because
they occur in a 1914-18 society which is
also breaking established rules under
wartime pressures.
Of all the people in these three novels,
only Richard’s doctor father and mother
are truly innocently in love, through
years of dullness, respectable poverty,
and, in Paris, the echoes of the rigors
of war. And Richard’s father tells him:
“I see you need women, and 1 see it’s
not easy for you to accommodate your-
self to this need. You are unable to ac-
cept the urge as on a par with hunger
and the need for sleep. No, you must
prettify it. You daub it with coarse
colors. Be careful, my dear boy, or one
of these days you’ll confuse everything
and lose your bearings and be incapable
of happiness with any woman”.
Paul Danner’s father, in contrast, was
a hard, God-fearing Florida man whose
instruction was limited to the principle
of “tell ’em nothing, and slap ’em if they
try anything”. So when Paul was
seventeen he first learned the biological
facts of life, and at nineteen he could
not resist an assault on the person of
Mildred Dudy, the Chamber of Com-
merce beauty queen who won because
she looked so good in very short shorts
and who continued to wear them as a
kind of badge of her success.
Strange as it may seem in Australia,
where punishment is on a lesser scale,
Paul seemed a certainty for the electric
chair. As prosecutor Ony Weed de-
clared, rape was rape, the reasons be
hanged, and the only penalty for it was
death. Paul’s lawyer, helped by a re-
tired professor of psychiatry, tried to
convince a practical judge that a sen-
tence of ten to twenty years was more
suitable. Most of the story is told during
the trial, when the characters are deve-
loped and, to some extent, the society
of the 1960 s and its supposedly en-
lightened attitudes are surveyed.
“Without Consent” is written tersely,
but it’s an edged terseness that cuts
deep. Ony Weed speaks for a tribe,
Dr Talton for a person. The tribe de-
mands an eye for an eye, but is as
blind in its condemnation of human
weakness as it can also be of human
rights.
Good writers excel in catching these
weaknesses in moments of bright truth.
Joseph Kesse! takes one inside Richard
Dalleau's schoolboy brother: “Daniel
knew the rules according to which one’s
life should be conducted. This sense
of right was more instinctive than the
result of education, it was as if inscribed
in his heredity. But his character and
temperament rebelled, could not con-
form to the rules”. So he was easily
led home and to bed by an obsessed
woman.
When Richard heard of it: “A humili-
ation, an unavoidable jealousy overcame
him. To think that he was still ignorant
of what Daniel had just experienced.
And the recital had caused him an odi-
ous sensual stimulation; with horror he
felt a tingling warmth flood his face”.
Fortunately for Richard there was no
Florida beauty queen willing to ride out
to the swamp to see the bird flights.
There was “a grubby servant girl” named
Mathilde to go to, and “he was glad to
have Mathilde live, through him, a
mysterious life, really a life not to be
shared, and he witnessed the propagation
of his own pleasure, and was afraid of
his power.”
17'essel tells his story of the Dalleaus
and the war, where Theodore Pratt
lets the story be told in the homes,
streets, cafes, offices, and the court
house of Poinciana, Florida, by the in-
habitants. So does Brigid Brophy, whose
manly Miss Braid opens her short novel
with a baritone, “Men are . . . coarse”,
and Miss Antonia Mount with a mur-
mured soprano, “The note . . .” which
exhausted her as though she had sung a
whole aria.
It was a note from a sailor to one of
the girls at their finishing school, to
which Royalty was coming, from Lon-
don. Miss Antonia “can’t bear being
adored by ugly girls”, but she attracts
crushes. And towards her prettier girls,
poor dear, she has urges. Could she,
sitting among them reading texts, lean
forward to touch Regina's neckline with
her lips without Royalty noticing? “Ah,
one could not . . . ah, ache”.
Unfortunately Royalty was then stung
by a wasp, and on the neckline. With
only the purest thoughts Antonia drew
out the venom, a jealous little girl took
a picture, which appeared in the papers
and drew thunder from the Palace.
Down came a Commander to escort
Royalty home, and either he or Antonia
succumbed to the other. Perhaps the
clue to Antonia is that, “I am a person
who all her fife long has been unable to

In Light and Darkness. Chris Wallace-
Crabbe. Angus & Robertson. 17s.
6d.
Poems. Gwen Harwood. Angus &
Robertson. 17s. 6d.
Tn these attractively produced volumes,
Angus and Robertson display the
work of three Australian poets who have
little in common except their refusal to
display their Australianness. All of them
use the language and the land they were
born to for their own individual purposes
rather than for national advertisement.
Of the three, John Blight is easily the
most single-minded. The ninety pieces
which make up “A Beachcomber’s
Diary” are devoted to a single subject
(the sea) and a single form (the sonnet).
Within this deliberately restricted range
Blight creates a remarkable variety of
patterns. From time to time, indeed,
his rhyme and metre depart so widely
from the conventional forms that it is
questionable whether some of his 14-line
poems should be called sonnets at all.
Yet it is pattern which is at the basis
of all his work: patterns of verse struc-
ture and texture, patterns of perception.
Some of the best pieces in “A Beach-
comber's Diary” are those in which
Blight simply transfers into verse the
arrangements of creatures and objects
which present themselves to his vision.
“Cormorants” is a poem of this order,
or “Mangrove.”
One would suspect that such fidelity to
one particular kind of poem would be
motivated by (and would generate) some
more human passion than the desire to
record the movement of the ocean and
the life along its edge. And “Why I
Write About the Sea” does state what
appear to be the wider intentions of “A
Beachcomber’s Diary”. From the beach,
the land appears to the poet like a huge,
untidy ship in dry dock:
From that littoral which is the haunt
of scavenging gulls,
the “ship” looms important, and looks
large and majestic: and so the ocean
lulls
me into a sense of ease, and thus I
write my books.
What is to me the most disappointing
feature of Blight's verse is that it does
not really carry out the programme sug-
gested in these lines. The land and its
inhabitants get into his sonnets chiefly
through some coyly developed metaphors
(“Low Tide”, “Beacon”) or through
moralistic couplets attached to the sea-
scapes. He never really makes the sea
viable as an allegorical mirror of man’s
life. On the contrary, his lines most
clearly have the thrust of passion when
(as in “A Sea of Jellyfish” or “Mud”)
he writes of it simply as elemental crea-
tion. John Blight seems to me a para-
doxical figure: a poet who is at his best
when he disregards people.
“In Light and Darkness” starts out
from an attitude which, on the face of it,
makes it rather easier for Chris Wal-
lace-Crabbe to create a humanly relevant
poetry. The epigraph to the volume is
taken from John Locke: “Our portion
lies only here in this little spot of earth,
where we and all our concernments are
shut up”. That these words accurately
reflect the living concerns of the poems
that follow is attested by some of their
explicit statements as well as their whole
quality and conduct. “A Wintry Mani-
festo”, for instance, leads to lines which
give Wallace-Crabbe’s own version of
his central theme: “Our greatest joy to
mark an outline truly / And know the
piece of earth on which we stand”.
The poet’s particular piece of earth
is modern Melbourne, but the problem
which most vitally exercises his imagi-
nation is an old one the duality of
man’s nature; and his solution is essen-
tially the humanist one the hopeful
acceptance of the variety of this world.
The problem and its solutions spread
through the book by means of the
imagery suggested in the title poem.
Images of light and dark, night and day,
carry out for Wallace-Crabbe a more
than pictorial function. And they are
aided in their task of realising his themes
by a reticent but firm control of verse
structure witnessed, for instance, by
the splendid sestina, “Out of the Sha-
dows”.
Wallace-Crabbe’s response to form is
not a purely technical one. In “The
Ritualists” he sees the stylised game of
cricket as a suggestive metaphor for the
whole conduct of a man's life it is
a drama in which personal needs are
shaped and regulated by public conven-
tions. On the one hand, his awareness
of the public conventions leads him to
some convincingly satirical pieces
(notably “Melbourne”). On the other,
his sense of life as drama, development,
underlies what I take to be some of his
most rewarding verse. “End of Term”
is perhaps the best poem of “In Light
and Darkness”. And it owes its excel-
lence to the fact that Wallace-Crabbe has
projected his theme into the narrative
mode a mode, that is to say, which
demands development and resolution,
and which permits of contemplation.
In contemplating school children at the
end of term, he is reminded of his own

all the year round.
childhood (another important source of
his inspiration) and released into a
moving consideration of his own and
everyman’s present condition. At its
best, as in “End of Term”, Wallace-
Crabbe’s poetry is strong without being
tough, attractive without being speciously
charming, and is borne along by an
unspectacular but expert technique.
Of the three volumes, Gwen Har-
wood’s “Poems” is in some ways the
most substantial and intense. The poems
in Part I, especially, are united by the
two motifs of pain and music. Some
of the pieces (“In Hospital”, “The
Wound") deal with the literal pain of
illness and surgery. Elsewhere, the
theme becomes the pain of love and
living. Nearly always the emotion is
cast in a dramatic and intensely personal
mould, the technique being used (in part)
to enforce the power and immediacy of
the experience. It is her love of music
which often makes the pain tolerable
for Gwen Harwood (and her readers).
In “The Waldstein” its power to heal is
stated explicitly. In other poems, musi-
cal imagery carries a large part of the
meaning. In yet others, the concern for
music is translated into a rhythmic line
extended at quite remarkable length.
The flowing phrases work against the
urgency of the created situations to give
the poems their special aesthetic balance.
Gwen Harwood is blessed with a fur-
ther major item in the equipment of a
poet: the ability habitually to translate
and compress her experience into image
and metaphor. Time and time again
one is struck by the originality and power
with which her language renders feeling
and thought. Beneath the lyric melody
of the lines, one is made unmistakably
aware of a genuine verbal complexity.
This quality is discernible even in the
second section of the book, that contain-
ing the “Professor Eisenbart” poems.
Buttressed by the most insistent rhymes
in the volume, these start out as a seem-
ingly satirical series on the limitations
of the scientific mind. If, how'ever, the
sharp point of the irony deflates Pro-
fessor Eisenbart into ordinary frailty,
the force of the poems’ verbal beha-
vior deepens him, in the end, into genu-
ine humanity. He is transformed from
a cipher into a person. The same fun-
damental qualities of imagination (w'hich
I would unhesitatingly call virtues) con-
tinue into the third and last group of
Gwen Harwood's poems, those originally
written over the pen-name of “Walter
Lehmann”. Although their motivating
situations move away from the writer’s
own experience, they retain their con-
cern for all that is most personal in
human life, and continue at the same
level of achievement. For, although
this is a first volume, “achievement”
rather than “promise” is the appropriate
word to select from the critical vocabu-
lary; and achievement, at that, of no
mean order.

Master Builder
Walter Burley Griffin. James Birrell.
University of Queensland Press.
105 s.
Ilf alter Burley Griffin must be the
" most researched and the least pub-
lished of all architects. Scores of people
have accumulated material about him;
his associates, friends and admirers all
gathered material and, not least, his
widow gathered a monumental heap of
data about him. All this was for books
that were never written, but now James
Birrell has got his work into print to
make a very good book.
By no means does Mr Birrell con-
fine himself to Griffin's Australian acti-
vities, but properly traces his life and
work on the three continents that bear
Griffin work. Griffin’s emergence from
the most advanced American architec-
tural school of his time is carefully
traced and the net result is somewhat
disappointing for the early Griffin build-
ings are except to the eye of love
indistinguishable from the Frank Lloyd
Wright buildings of the period. As they
also suffer from Wright’s mannerisms
Griffin is revealed as a somewhat less
original designer than w'as previously
supposed. This is not criticism, but
indeed oblique praise, of Mr Birrell’s
fine research into his subject; research
that is at least documented, if not
heavily so.
Even Griffin’s drawings could be mis-
taken for those of Wright, which does
neither Griffin nor Wright any good. And
even if Wright had been half as good
as his opinion of himself that was no
reason for Griffin to lose himself so
much in another man’s ideas.
But the most important work, to us,
is the plan of Canberra which Griffin
won in open competition in the early
years of this century. Mr Birrell traces
the history of this project in admirable
detail even if he indulges in the sad
joke of “Capital Capers”.
Griffin moved from the United States
to Australia at that time and Mr Bir-
rell has been painstaking, thorough and
clear in tracing and analysing his purely
architectural local work. There is
shown to be a surprising amount of it
much still in existence and an
attempt is made to show that it affected
the course of Australian architecture.
Not true. Griffin was a bird of passage
in Australian affairs and most of the
influence Mr Birrell attributes to him
belongs really to the glossy American
architectural magazines that have, more
than any other single factor, kept Aus-
tralia from having an architecture of
its own.
Perhaps Griffin did give Australia
its first (imported) modern houses (Mr
Birrell somewhat oddly calls them
homes as though the two terms were
completely interchangeable). The houses
certainly are interesting even if their
influence when they were built was non-
existent. But Mr Birrell shows Griffin
as a rugged pioneer of modern architec-
ture. in an Australia that was overloaded
with the decayed revivals of the revivals
of the architectural styles of the 19th
century. Griffin was a brave man to
have tackled the then Australian stodgi-
ness in that way; but then he had enor-
mous prestige as author of the Canberra
plan. The idea of Canberra evolved at a
time when modern town planning was
cutting its milk teeth and thus Canberra
is, and will be for some time, a town and
not the metropolis it should be. But
Griffin gave it a basis from which the
National Capital Development Commis-
sion has every chance of producing the
fine city of Canberra of the future.
The last chapter of Mr Birrell’s book
comes into the crystal ball department,
but as his is a flawed and clouded crys-
tal ball it need not detain us here ex-
cept to remark that it lacks the wide
scope and sound basis of the chapters
which precede it.
Much work has gone into this book:
it is widely researched, beautifully writ-
ten, well illustrated and, merely as an
object, a beautiful book to hold in the
hand. For this latter quality the pub-
lishers, the University of Queensland
Press, should take much credit. It is
impossible to conceive that in the future
any collection of books devoted to Aus-
tralian architecture could exclude Mr
Birrell's important book.

Plenty Optimism but Short on Orders
A survey of 340 Australian manufacturing companies
indicates a widespread improvement in industrial
activity and buoyant hopes for the immediate future.
The survey, released last week by the Bank of NSW and the
Associated Chambers of Manufactures, exudes confidence to
a degree that, in one sense, the impression could be gained
that only a shortage of labor is holding back production.
This impression comes from a statement that 20 p.c. of the
companies surveyed listed labor shortages as the principal
factor putting a brake on output. Other companies also
complained of an emerging labor shortage but evidently are
not rushing to install automation.
A little more perspective is given by the president of the
Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, Mr
R. V. Allison, when he said that optimism should be tempered
by the realisation that more than 40 p.c. of Australian industry
was stiff operating below satisfactory rates of operation.
It is a fact that surplus production capacity remains, and a
shortage of orders is a more likely impediment to expansion.
Export orders and deliveries appear to be lower than
anticipated last November and stocks of raw materials have
tended to. rise. So those who complain about a shortage of
labor evidently are in a more fortunate position than those
who are anxious for orders.
Of interest to the capital market is that slightly stronger
expenditure is expected on plant and machinery over the next
year, but expenditure programmes on new factory buildings
remain conservative. This suggests a hesitancy to add to
surplus productive capacity in certain sectors.
The survey gives the impression of less pressure on available
resources but possible wage inflation for skilled workers.
Japan Expects Balance -
of-payments Problems
/Confirmation, through official trade figures for January,
that Japan now is Australia’s best customer throws into
relief the imbalance of trade between the two countries.
Commonsense suggests that, as a long-term trading partner,
Japan must strive to improve her flow of goods to Australia.
She has been making rapid headway, but not rapid enough
if related to Japan’s balance-of-payments problem.
The three-to-one trade gap gives Japan the opportunity to
speak with more assertiveness when talking of growth pros-
pects. Also the Commonwealth Government is well aware of
Australia’s need to develop stiff further its role in Asia. That
is why the hard facts of life, involving the debits and credits
in the balance of payments, must inevitably become a major
issue with the two countries.
The Japanese Government last January published its fore-
cast of the balance of payments for the year to March 31,
1965. The forecast, issued by the Japanese Economic Plan-
ning Agency, estimates that exports and imports would balance
at 6.2 billion US dollars each, but invisibles of 550 m. dollars
would create a deficit on trading account. On capital account,
Japan expects to achieve a surplus of about 400 m. US dollars,
giving an overall deficit of 150 m. dollars. This forecast could
be optimistic, because there is some doubt that exports will
reach the anticipated level of 6.2 billion dollars.
Estimates for 1963-64 indicate a trade gap with the rest
of the world of 250 m. dollars plus invisibles of 410 m. dollars.
Capital account is expected to cover most of this, but the
overall balance is an estimated deficit of around 99m. dollars.
Under Japan’s old system of six-monthly foreign exchange
budgets, an estimate is made of foreign currency available
from commodity exports and other transactions during that
period. After calculating the likely amount of foreign cur-
rencies that may be used during that period, the authorities
fix specific foreign exchange quotas for commodity imports
and invisible trade.
Many import items, such as wool, receive automatic appro-
val when application is made. As from April 1, however,
Japan has arranged with IMF to transfer from Article 14
countries to Article 8 countries and has agreed to abandon
her foreign exchange budget system. When this changeover
is made there will be no direct measures left to Japan to con-
trol imports except on a few special items such as agriculture.
Japan will still retain its import collateral system under
which the importer must deposit about 1 p.c. in addition to
other normal financial arrangements. The Japanese Govern-
ment can increase this deposit if circumstances require it,
but a more effective method of restraining importers is to
tighten bank lending and to raise bank rate. This would
tend to restrain import growth.
Naturally, the Japanese Government must become in-
creasingly concerned over the loss of foreign exchange in
areas where Japan is not earning her way and, to this extent,
some internal pressure could develop. So it follows that
Japan is likely to seek some means to correct the imbalance
of trade with Australia.
Tug-of-war again Disturbs
Copper Prices
A ustralian copper producers are presumably viewing the
**•*■ flurry in world prices with considerable interest. The
sharemarkets also have lately learnt to watch a wider range
of commodity prices with a very keen eye.
So far as copper is concerned, it seems certain that stable
markets will be restored long before Australia's newer sources
(notably Broken Hill South’s Cobar mine) come into produc-
tion. Nonetheless the present tussle between overseas pro-
ducers and the London Metal Exchange looks particularly
educative.
Any too vigorous upward price burst has to hold the ex-
tremely competitive position of aluminium well within its
sights. The immediate situation, however, shows a strong,


world wide demand, thoroughly justifying the Rhodesians’
return to full capacity.
But they have not been able to maintain their selling price
(for contract wire bars) at £stg236 a ton, as planned when
the productive breakout was announced in January. Rates
to UK and Continental buyers were last week raised to £stg244,
while American producers brought their prices into line as
well.
LME levels have, of course, gone much higher, in an
atmosphere of some irregularity. Despite producers reitera-
ted willingness to supply metal well below the LME, that
exchange does appear to reflect a few of the political and labor
problems harassing copper at this moment.
At the lower price, producers also face a decided pressure
on stocks, especially by consumers who can't see prices going
back.
Coal under Challenge for
Gas Making
Cir Edward Warren sprang very virtuously to coal’s defence
after the chairman of the Australian Gas Light Company,
Mr C. G. Crane, had trailed an obvious coat on the use of
substitute materials in gas making.
Natural gas and fuel oil are
much before the public eye at
present. In particular, Mr
Crane was not being over-
dramatic in claiming that “the
accelerated oil exploration pro-
jects in Australia make the pos-
sibility of the discovery of
workable quantities of natural
gas an exciting prospect”.
Known natural-gas reserves
would have to multiply tre-
mendously to make their utilisa-
tion a practical proposition. Mr
Crane, though, made the future
challenge exceedingly precise:
“The extent of the partnership
between the coal and gas indus-
tries in the future depends on
the coal industry itself and how
well and how quickly it can
adapt itself in the present com-
petitive energy market”.
Sir Edward almost gave the
appearance of shrugging this
off 'by observing how “the pro-
portion of black coal produc-
tion used for the manufacture
of town gas would not exceed
8 p.c. of the total consump-
tion”. But, most significantly,
he did not hesitate to urge the
critical need to corisider Aus-
tralia’s fuel and energy require-
ments on a national basis.
Last week, directors of colliery owner Waned Holdings
referred to the coal industry’s “obscure” future and the
chairman of the Australian Gas Light Company threw
doubts on the continued use of coal for gas making.
NSW output dropped from a 1962 peak of 19,030,000
tons to 18,886,000 tons in 1963. The 1962 figure
benefited from high exports to Japan. Some sources see
these increasing again soon, though most of the export
advantages lie with Queensland.
More Marine Linkages for
the Bounding Mayne
mighty P & O's purchase of a 20 p.c. shareholding in
Mayne Nickless Ltd may have more to it than merely
buying into a thoroughly successful land transport company.
Mayne, too, could mate closer to the shipping group than
just obtaining a sizeable loan to fund its short-term debt.
Mayne Nickless runs a thriving bulk commodities section,
which must surely gain even greater appeal among raw
material producers as an expanded Commonwealth roads policy
gets under way. P & O has only lately decided to add bulk
carriers to the fleet.
There would appear no reason why these shouldn’t be
capable of profitable operation on an Australian route.
Unfortunately P & O’s 1963 report has belatedly to confess
that ‘‘British shipowners have not been amongst the leaders
in bulk carrier operation, but this type of vessel is well
established on world trade routes and, with the steady develop-
ment of new ore fields and the ports to serve them, they
seem likely to continue to prosper”.
So the four recently ordered carriers, each of 38,850 tons
deadweight with a service speed of 15 knots, do not enter
the service until 1965. Integration with Australian interests
sounds highly feasible.
Trucks Lead February Rise
in Registrations
confirmation, if it were needed, of the revival in
private investment is seen in the record February figures
for motor vehicle registrations, which show that the propor-
tionate increase in registrations of trucks far outmatched all
other classes of vehicles. Com*
pared with an overall rise of
9.7 p.c. in motor vehicle regi-
strations over February, 1963,
registrations of trucks increased
just on 25 p.c. and those of
motor cars by 11 p.c.
However, it has to be remem-
bered that while most of -the
motor cars registered are now
wholly or mostly manufactured
here, this applies to a far less
extent to trucks. For instance,
Bedford trucks, which had
about a third of the Australian
market with 6577 registrations
out of a total of 20,674 for
the year ended December last,
are assembled here from im-
ported engines and panels, only
such parts as batteries and
tyres being manufactured in
Australia. Ford, with 2594
registrations of trucks last year,
has all the engines of their
heavy trucks imported.
The most notable exception
to this appears to be Interna-
tional Harvester, which account-
ed for 4153, or about a fifth
of new registrations of trucks
in 1963. Most of these trucks,
including the engines, are
manufactured in Australia (the
company claims its Geelong
foundry is as big as any in the motor industry here). Ihe
company told The Bulletin last week that two orders of
600 trucks each from the defence services had been most
encouraging. It is now launching a new series of from 30 cwt
to six ton trucks of an entirely new delivery van design which
have been a great success in the United States, the hoods
being made alternatively of steel and aluminium.
The commercial vehicle trade is expecting a further intensi-
fication of competition from trucks made in Japan and
assembled in Australia.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The Employers’ View of Wages
“Commission flirting with unions’ philosophy ”
At the outset of his presentation of
the employers’ submissions in the
basic wage case, their counsel, Mr James
Robinson, said the annual cost to wages
bills of the unions’ claims for a 525. a
week increase in award wages would be
£312 million, compared with the Arbi-
tration Commission's estimate of £6O
million for the 12s. increase awarded in
1961.
The claim for 525., he argued, was
ipso facto ruled out by the 1961 judg-
ment because 21s. of this was put in to
cater for cost-of-living increases between
1953 (when c. 0.1. adjustments ceased)
and 1961, whereas in the 1961 judgment
increases in the c. 0.1. since 1953 were in
fact catered for by the accumulated in-
creases in the basic wage in the inter-
vening years and the 12s. increase
awarded in 1961.
So far as c.o-1. was concerned, Mr
Robinson said that, if relevant at all in
the light of the accepted criterion of
capacity to pay, these should be related
to the period since 1961.
Between the March quarter, 1961, and
December quarter, 1963, the consumer
price index moved by the equivalent (in
terms of the basic wage) of an increase
of Is. lOd. a week.
However, as Mr Robinson stated later,
the Commission's reviews in 1962 (extra
week's leave case) and 1963 (margins
case) have already taken rises in pro-
ductivity cum capacity into account and
he asked the Commission: “Because the
1962 and 1963 reviews were on matters
other than the basic wage, does that
mean in the 1964 review the Commission
will ignore what it did in 1962 and 1963
and proceed as if it never happened,
merely for the reason that this is a dif-
ferent matter? It seems the Commission
has to be convinced that it should not
distribute the same productivity twice or
three times, in margins, annual leave,
adjustments for prices and so on.”
4An this point he said employers were
” gravely alarmed at the extent to which
the Commission was flirting with the
unions’ philosophy, which he described
as wanting periodic assessments of
national productivity gains, every three
to four years, for margins and also in-
creases in award wages as though no
distribution to workers had occurred
from the productivity kitchen during
the intervening periods. These increases
were then to be capped by further un-
known amounts in the light of price
movements —in the basic wage annually,
in margins on the three to four year
review.
But adding the Bs. Bd. from produc-
tivity to the Is. lOd. from c. 0.1. gives
a sum of 10s. 6d. a week and, Mr
Robinson added, on the basis of what
appeared to be the productivity cum
capacity plus prices principles adopted
by the Commission, this should be the
amount debated in these proceedings.
“We fundamentally disagree with the
method of wage fixing involved in arrive
ing at the 10s. 6d.” Mr Robinson said.
“But it is important to note that the
quantum difference between what we will
be submitting is the proper method of
wage fixation (65.) in total award wages
and the application of the Commission’s
1961 judgment is 4s. 6d. We do not say
that the amount is insignificant —it
represents about £27 million per annum.
But it does indicate the setting in which
the Commission can, in due course, con-
sider the employers’ application to have
the ‘total wage’ concept adopted.”
1%/Ir Robinson then gave the Commission
a preview of the sort of arguments
he said he would be developing in the
total wage case (which is to follow the
basic wage case) on what the employers
considered to be the appropriate method
of determining award wages.
“How can we be guided by produc-
tivity movements for the future,” he
asked, “when history shows wide fluctua-
tions from year to year? The answer
lies in eliminating the fluctuations by
taking a moving average of productivity
increases over a longer period.
“Australian experience has shown a
pattern of 4 to 5 year cyclical fluctua-
tions. We have taken the period since
1948/49 and, with the use of a four-
year moving average, it can be seen that
fhe growth in national output per person
employed has progressed at a remark-
ably even rate.
“On this basis, the Commission can see
that in a four-year period such as the
Commission suggested in 1961, Austra-
lian experience could not be expected to
provide real increases in wages beyond
6 to 7 p.c. or from \\ to If p c. a year.”
(Compare union claim which envisages
13.9 p.c. in a single year.)
“It is our view that the Commission
should review the economy annually;
that the Commission should exercise its
discretion upon proper evidence and
argument to increase award wages be-
tween 1 and 2 p.c. The range is dictated
by the annual rate of growth.
“If, as in recent years, the rate has
declined, the range may have to be lower.
If Australia’s rate of improvement
quickens and becomes comparable with
overseas countries, the range may, in-
deed, be raised. But, on Australia's
proven rate of increase, an assumption
beyond li p.c. to 11 p.c. is not avail-
able.
“If the Commission goes to 3 p.c. this
year on the basis of anticipated rise in
the forthcoming season, the four-year
moving average figures show that only
one p.c. a year would be available over
the following three years.
“The yardstick for the Commission
should be between 1 p.c. and 2 p.c. Two
p.c. maximum allows flexibility and does
not prevent the application of a dras-
tically lower figure in the remaining years.
“f| NE cannot, of course, guarantee price
” stability, but it would allow Aus-
tralia the best chance, within reality, of
having substantial stability of costs and
prices with steady development. If this
occurred, employees, too, would have
the vital benefit of increases in wages
uneroded by prices a feature which
was lacking in the ’sos.
“It is hard to appreciate why such an
approach is not readily embraced by the
trade union movement including the
white collar associations. It is hard to
appreciate why the approach is not en-
dorsed by the Commonwealth.
“The reason is probably that the unions
consider they can achieve more by
claiming outrageous figures and then
relying on the price adjustment sanctuary
to protect the surplus the amount in
excess of productivity gains.”
For as Mr Robinson demonstrated, if
the total level of wage costs rises at the
same rate as the real increase in the pro-
duction of goods and services, the
increased efficiency and production
should, on the basis of the economy as
a whole, be able to absorb the higher
level of wage costs.
“However, if the level of wage costs,
whether by action of the Commission or
otherwise, rises faster than the increase
in productivity, absorption in profits of
the increased wage costs is not a realis-
tic prospect but inflation of prices is.
“If the Commission’s estimate of the
productivity gains were too high, the
rise in prices may affect the real increase
in the award wages, but this would be
both expected and equitable”, Mr
Robinson said.
“As to increase in prices for other
reasons, much falls within the province
of the Government. Undoubtedly, by
financial policy in its widest sense, the
Government should smooth out the de-
mand curve and take whatever action is
necessary.”

Measuring Cost of Protection
Textile Council and the Tariff Board
npHE recent bombardment of the Tariff
A Board by evidence in the textile
industry’s application for higher tariffs
has thrown new light on the measure-
ment of the cost of protection, notably
by Mr A. W. W. Godfrey, the research
economist of the Textile Council of Aus-
tralia, in reply to arguments by Caesar
Fabrics Ltd (opposing the application).
Caesar Fabrics has claimed the vali-
dity of three propositions, and if these
are accepted by the Tariff Board, Mr
Godfrey believes they will affect its
judgment not merely in the textile in-
dustry case but also in all its future in-
quiries into any industry.
In short, the three propositions are:
• That protection to any industry
imposes a measurable cost on the com-
munity;
• That this cost varies directly with
the level of the tariff required and the
value of the protected local industry’s
output, and the cost can be measured
relatively between industries and possibly
in absolute cash terms;
O That the cost, as thus imposed,
should be the main factor deciding
whether or not a particular industry
should be encouraged.
Without tacitly admitting that there is
such a cost, Mr Godfrey advances the
view that Caesar Fabrics (taking a simi-
lar line to the 1929 Brigden Committee
but for a different purpose) is mistaken
in adopting an accountancy method in
calculating it. “The method of mea-
suring such a cost (if any) must be based
on different criteria, the concept of
‘opportunity’ cost,” he says.
“It would seem,” he goes on, “that
there may be an advantage in buying
cheaper goods from overseas instead of
making them at home, if the local re-
sources displaced by the change can be
moved to a no less efficient alternative
use and, in addition, the move allows
sufficient increased exports or import
replacement goods of other types to be
generated to offset the increased im-
ports.
“The cost of protection would be a
measure of the cost of failing to take
advantage of this opportunity. This
quantity is very difficult to measure, but
it is certain that it would be very much
less than the difference between the
price of the locally produced and the
imported products.”
Although for space reasons they can-
not be gone into here, Mr Godfrey has
produced convincing arguments to de-
bunk Caesar Fabrics’ approach and has
put forward what seems to be a much
more realistic line to take, based on the
proposition that the major factor in
assessing costs of protection is growth
potential.
The growth argument for protection
(that is, that the tariff, by stimulating
economic development, has caused Aus-
tralia’s real income to be higher than it
would be without protection) was the
only one to be supported by A. J.
Reitsma in his treatise on “Trade Protec-
tion in Australia”.


Competitive Pricing in Carton Industry
Outsiders cause reduced profit margins
Last week the bulletin pub-
lished a survey on the packaging
industry. Reed Paper Products,
National Bag Co. and Australian
Sisalkraft dealt with the growth
and the latest trends, and now
other large manufacturers state
their views on the future of the
industry which is at present sell-
ing between £35 and £4O mil-
lion worth of goods a year.
IY/lanufacturers of cardboard cartons,
containers and boxes report that their
sales for this time of year are higher than
last year and that forward prospects are
encouraging.
The consumption of paperboard in-
creased dramatically from a low of
204,100 tons in 1961-62 to 240,300 tons
in 1962-63 due mainly to a recovery
from the credit squeeze. Increased
exports, too, have helped, greater
demands being made on packaging com-
panies for containers for products to go
overseas.
Last week prospects and trends in
packaging were discussed. This week
competition and its effect on profitability
are discussed.
Mr J. J. Mcllwaine, general mana-
ger of J. Fielding and Co. Ltd, one
of the largest producers of cardboard
containers, cartons and boxes, said in-
creased activity in Government Print-
ing Offices had caused severe com-
petition in the carton industry.
Because Government Printers are
now undertaking work which had pre-
viously been farmed out to job printers,
the private concerns had turned to other
operations to maintain their income.
One of these was an entry into the
carton field. “Because of this there
are a lot of small operators who, to get
business, have cut profit margins right
back and have created a difficult mar-
ket for the older established com-
panies,” he said.
“Also in this country there has grown
up a system of do-it-yourself printers
who print their own packages, thereby
adding to the industry’s capacity and in-
creasing competition still further. Near-
ly all large users nowadays have their
own carton-making plant which has
taken work away from the industry.”
But despite stiff competition and re-
duced profit margins, Mr Mcllwaine
said things were brighter than they were
last year and sales were up.
manufacturers are worried about
increases in the cost of raw materi-
als and labor, which they will have to
face very soon. “There have been in-
creases in rates of pay, liberalisation of
long service leave and increased annual
holidays,” he said. “And these, although
they have not caused any significant
rises, must eventually result in increased
costs both to us and our suppliers.
“So far the box maker has been loth
to pass these costs on to consumers,
but it is getting harder every day to
contain them. If the basic wage is
raised soon and with dwindling profit
margins the manufacturer is going to
have to put up his prices or go broke.
We were able to cope with it five or six
years ago because of the increased
volume of business, but now that the
volume has stabilised prices will have
to go up.
“Australian packaging compared with
overseas is very high due mainly to the
raw material from the paper mills. If
we could import paper without having
to pay the high protective tariff, the cost
of packaging would drop and types of
packaging could be expanded.
“I don't know which country has the
lowest packaging prices, but America
is well below our level because of their
paper resources. The cost of labor is
higher, but the far lower cost of raw
materials offsets this”.
1%/fR Mcllwaine said the greatest
single advance in Australian packa-
ging since the war had been the develop-
ment and refinement of the cardboard
carton, and the widespread use of pre-
packaging.
The corrugated carton used to be a
dull, unattractive container, often poor
in quality Now it has been dressed
up, made more colorful and has become
a definite aid to selling. It also offers
more protection from rough handling
and extremes of weather.
Advanced printing techniques and re-
search into strengthening and water-
proofing had contributed to the cartons’
advanced stage of development. “It
has become a very good advertising
medium toe," Mr Mcllwaine added.
He expressed the opinion that a
closer liaison between advertising agen-
cies and packaging manufacturers could
provide still greater advances in the
carton field. “Often,” . he said, “the
agencies design for the manufacturer a
package which is impossible to dupli-
cate, either because of the colors or the
printing the agency requires, or because
the goods to be packed are of such an
irregular shape that the cost becomes
prohibitive because of the inserts needed
to protect the contents.
“The future of the packaging indus-
try should be good if competition is
stabilised. The future is in line with Aus-
tralia’s future. We are growing at a faster
rate than the population and I believe
we will start exporting a lot more goods
which need packaging,” he added.
11/fR K. H. Dodge, managing director
of Dodge Consolidated Industries
Ltd, said the Australian packaging in-
dustry was just on the borderline of
over-capacity with the amount of
machinery it had. Large runs of pro-
duction by some companies had caused
a reduction in prices.
“Prices fell during the credit squeeze
when costs were still high,” he went on.
“Some packaging lines had bad results
which continued later on in view of the
fact that .here 'is quite a lot of machi-
nery in Australia and the big operators
try to fill the capacity of their machines
to the fullest extent. This has affected
the price structure more than anything
else.
“So far the cost of raw materials has
been reasonably steady. There was an
increase in ink prices and there could
be an increase in other prices if there
is a wage increase.
"But still the use of big machinery
is dangerous. It can be used to gocd
effect in America and the Continent
where demand is greater and a larger
volume is required. It has not become
quite as necessary here. It also poses
big problems in warehousing because the
customer wants tc stockpile and draw
on his supply whenever he wants it. This
causes big space problems and is very
costly”.
Mr Dodge, whose company makes
corrugated, solid and pre-cut cartons,
showcards, posters, display cartons,
paper bags and record covers, said sales
and production for this time of year
were higher than for last year.
There had not been very much in
the way of new developments in the
industry, but more and more aluminium
foil would be used in the future. The
trend to unit packaging had increased,
due mainly to the influence of super-
markets.
“The future of the packaging indus-


try is good as it hasn’t really been
touched yet,” he said. “Paper and
board consumption in Australia is
roughly one-quarter that of the United
States but it will continue to grow as
our standard of living continues to ad-
vance. Profitability will recover, but it
is all a question of rationalised manu-
facture. For our part the forward order
position is much better than last year”.
Australian Consolidated Industries,
which makes corrugated paper and car-
tons, said in its 1963 annual report that
Australian sales of these containers re-
covered in 1963 with a resultant increase
in profits. The joint general managers,
Mr G. Haile and Mr H. J. Quinn, said
there was still over-capacity in the in-
dustry. Although profits recovered,
competition and increasing
costs resulted in lower profit
margins.
In New Zealand the group
turnover and profit were satis-
factory but slightly down on
1962. Plants in both countries
had been maintained to produce
at high efficiency.
Mr W. G. Firth, managing
director of P. J. Firth Ltd,
said fierce competition in all sec-
tions of the cardboard packaging
industry had reduced profit
margins. In the carton section
there had been the fiercest com-
petition.
The main problem was that
there had been tremendous
development in machinery for
the industry since the Second
World War. Many jobs which
previously had to be done by
hand could now be done by
machines.
“This has meant a tremendous
influx of complex plant to meet
demand and competition,” he
said. “Supply has more than
outstripped demand because of
The above graph shows the most recent figures available
from the Commonwealth Statistician on Austral ion paper-
board production. Annual production has now recovered from
the 1960-61-62 slump which was due to the credit squeeze.
the over-capacity. The market can more
than meet any demands placed upon it.
“A lot of people in the industry are
trying to keep their plant working at full
capacity in order to increase profit
margins, and still supply at a competitive
price. They are relying on volume of
production.
“In the paper box field the main com-
petition comes from the wire-stitched
box. Anybody can afford a wire stitch-
ing machine, in effect an industrial
stapler. It is not a very costly piece of
machinery.
“Quite a number of former employees
of the industry have become employers
and entered this field. And on the corru-
gated carton side of the business, there
have been a lot of people entering the
trade.
“While this side of the packaging busi-
ness was quite remunerative a few years
ago, there have been so many people
entering it that profit margins are now
hard to maintain.
“New plant gives increased production.
This helps quite a lot for a while, but
when everybody gets new plant it has an
adverse affect on yearly results. Our
figures are up on last year’s, but I under-
stand some smaller producers are having
a hard time.
“A lot of business is being done in the
trade which is not profitable. This is
revealed in recently published balance
sheets. The trade generally is facing
very severe competition. In certain
sections of the printing industry
particularly in the flexographic and litho-
graphic sections —there is about one-third
over-production.,
“Costs, including wages, have bounded
up, which doesn’t make things any easier.”
Mr Firth said Australian packaging
had developed tremendously since World
War 11. The demand for better packag-
ing had grown rapidly.
“If we turn out a bad package we
don’t do business with the company
again,” he said. “So we must maintain
a continually high standard to retain
orders and meet competition. Demands
of the user nowadays are such that we
must turn out a first quality product
because of competition, whereas a few
years ago customers were not so demand-
ing.
“We also have better packaging
materials available now in Australia. This
means that we can meet a customer's
quality specifications. Australian packag-
ing has made big strides in improvement
and development.”
Mr Firth sees a continual advance of
growth in the Australian packaging in-
dustry. It was going ahead, he said, and
would continue to go ahead. There had
been new styles of packages which were
not available a few years ago.
An executive of Broons Consolidated
Industries Limited said the cardboard
packaging industry had quite a lot of
surplus capacity. The competition it
caused did not affect only the cardboard
container section of the industry but the
packaging industry as a whole.
“But as far as we are con-
cerned,” he said, “we are
optimistic regarding the future.
We are thinking of ways to
utilise the excess capacity and
think we will be successful.
“Because of the greater
capacity than current market
demand we need to find these
new outlets. We are limited by
our population growth and we
have to contend with this more
than other countries with similar
living standards. So we have to
turn our minds to some other
form of outlet for our product.
“We cannot export our pro-
ducts because we cannot com-
pete in price with the American,
Japanese or Swedish product.
Another limiting factor is high
freight rates. Because our pro-
ducts are light and bulky,
freight rates become prohibitive.
“So we must look for new
markets in Australia.
“One that has great potential
is the fruit and vegetable in-
dustry. We are trying to
persuade producers to use fibre-
boa-rd cartons instead of wooden cases
to pack their goods. One development
in this field has been the use of heavily
waxed cartons to pack bananas.
“Growers are gradually turning to this
sort of packing although not as fast as
we would like them to.
“Other avenues are packing poultry
and freshly caught fish. All these things
can be packed in our products. Some
may need to be specially treated, but it
can be done. In this way we can reduce

Britain’s Financial Position
Stronger than Assumed
False picture of gold reserve figures
From SAMUEL BRITTAN in London
JT'he Bank of England has just pub-
fished a completely new rough
balance-sheet which shows that Britain’s
financial position in the world is
enormously stronger than most foreign
financiers and certainly most British
people have ever thought.
These exercises take a long time to
prepare and the balance-sheet, therefore,
relates to the end of 1962. But the
rough picture is as valid now as it ever
was.
The totals at the bottom of the
balance-sheet do not mean an awful lot.
But for what it is worth they show total
assets of (in round figures) £12,800
million, and total liabilities of £11,200
million. These are minimum estimates
of identifiable items. Fortunately, the
Bank is convinced that the understate-
ment of UK assets is much more serious
than the understatement of liabilities.
But to get anything of value out of
this, like any other balance-sheet, one
must look at the details. The first thing
that stands out is how false a picture is
given by the much publicised monthly
gold reserve figures. These reserves
stood at around £lOOO million at the
end of 1962, and are now £938 million.
Little would any innocent overseas
speculator realise that the British
Government has in its own hands and
available for use £385 million of dollar
securities acquired from British residents
during the war.
There are rumors that the Treasury
would like to count these as part of the
reserves, but that the Bank of England
is fighting an obscurantist battle to stop
this happening. For some unfathomable
reason the Bank seems determined to
publish as low a reserve figure as
possible.
the tentative balance-sheet for
the end of the 1962 just mentioned,
which is the first comprehensive exercise
done by the Bank, leaves out of account
Britain’s drawing rights at the Inter-
national Monetary Fund.
A section of these drawing rights is
counted as part of Britain's reserve in
the monthly bulletin put out by the
highly conservative IMF itself and by
most other overseas and international
monetary publications. Only the Bank
of England itself insists on publishing a
reserve figure which is lower than the
one found in any other standard source
of reference. Its behavior would be a
great political scandal if the issues could
be made comprehensible to the general
public.
One can’t help feeling that the Bank
is anxious to minimise the room for
manoeuvre it has, lest any Government
should take too many risks on an expan-
sionist economic policy.
But then if the room for manoeuvre
is so limited, why is the Bank so anxious
to get rid of the last vestiges of exchange
control and expose the reserves to the
free movement of money into and out
of London? Fortunately or unfortun-
ately, there is no great sinister explana-
tion tying all these threads together—
only an inherited assortment of con-
servative financial attitudes and an
attachment to the international financial
role of the City of London, which often
exceeds the enthusiasm of the actual
institution involved, which finds a lot
of this overseas prestige business much
less profitable than arranging amalgama-
tions and take-overs inside Britain.
T>ut to come back to the 1962 balance-
sheet. The most interesting single
item is the figure of £3OOO million for
the total value of dollar and other over-
seas securities held by British residents.
These are certainly mobilisable in an
emergency, and it is quite fantastic to
exclude them from any assessment of
Britain's second and third lines of
reserves.
All that would be necessary, if it
came to it, would be for the British
financial authorities to offer to purchase
these securities from private holders at
their market value. A good many
holders would probably surrender them
voluntarily if the appeal were made
sufficiently forceful. Indeed, even now,
when there is no emergency, why should
not the Government offer to buy these
securities, when the market seems ripe,
at, say, a 5 p.c. premium over market
value?
Such a transaction might not seem
good business for a private individual,
but for the British Government it would
be the best piece of business transacted
for a very long time. For the securities
purchased from private citizens would
be convertible into dollars or other
foreign currencies, and could thus en-
large the monthly reserve figure if the
latter were properly computed.
As the shortage of reserves has been
the main single factor holding up
Britain’s progress, it seems incredible
that nothing of this kind has been
thought of before.
Another interesting item shown in the
1962 balance-sheet is that British direct
investments abroad that is factories,
plantations, and other physical assets
are valued at £3500 million. This ex-
cludes the oil companies whose overseas
assets are valued at £.llOO million.
By contrast, overseas long-term in-
vestments in Britain are very much less.
In total they come to approximately
£2BOO million compared with a total
of about £BOOO million for British
private holdings of overseas long-term
assets.
new balance-sheet did not become
A available until March 9. Even so,
the London Stock Exchange has been
feeling a little more cheerful for the
past few weeks, partly owing to an
exaggerated idea of the extent to which
the public opinion polls were showing
a Conservative recovery. Even a speech
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that
gave the broadest hint that a Chan-
cellor has ever given in a pre-Budget
period that taxes would go up, did not
cause more than a tiny drop in the share
index.
Earlier in the week, the February
gold reserve figure showed a loss of
£l7 million, rather less than expected.
Most of this has probably already been
made up by money coming to London
since the Bank Rate was raised.
Retail trade statistics, published earlier
in the week, showed that sales in the
shops in January, the latest month for
which returns are available, were buoy-
ant but that there was nothing like a
wild buying spree.
There was also a small flurry in the
London gold market which was simply
a reflection of the weakness of the
Italian lira. The gold purchases, in fact,
came from Switzerland, presumably
made with money smuggled out over the
frontier. The chairman of the Bank of
London and South America, Sir George
Bolton, cheered the City with a very
buoyant review of the prospects for food
and raw material prices.
This will not help to keep the cost of
living down in Britain, but it will be of
great help to the under-developed
countries who depend on these commodi-
ties for their export earnings; and
although in theory it can be argued
either way experience has shown that
Britain has less trouble with her own
balance of payments when the primary
producing countries, especially those in
the sterling area, have well-lined pockets.

MARKET POINTERS
A Mixed Bag for Easter
Company results published last week
contained a few more reports of
lower earnings. The share market was
warned on this several times last year
lest it became too enthusiastic about
overall prospects.
Some of the latest reports indicate
that even selective share buyers are
getting a few surprises.
★ ★ ★
TJORG-WARNER (AUSTRALIA) had
its profit trimmed and evidently is
finding that its earnings have caught up
with the huge tax losses accumulated
before 1959. Latest profit is after pro-
viding £295,000 for tax compared with
a relatively light provision of £105,916
in the previous year. If the tax pro-
visions are added on to the declared net
profit, the net result for 1963 is still only
£817,016 compared with £897,132 in
1962.
The company is getting the benefit of
the current heavy demand for automatic
transmissions and the latest earning rate
of 24.1 p.c. on ordinary capital is pleas-
ing to those people who have been bid-
ding up for the lOs 1 . shares.
Earnings yield looks good but market
yield is still poor at 2.1 p.c. on the latest
6 p.c. dividend. If this dividend is
doubled again next year, yield will rise
to only 4.2 p.c.
The market apparently is confident
that Borg-Warner’s boom will continue.
★ ★ ★
TOHN LYSAGHT (AUSTRALIA)
LTD is the sheet steel in the sand-
wich at the moment. As BHP’s largest
customer it is affected by any rise in
local prices, but also must contend with
import competition.
Part of John Lysaght’s status in the
share market sprang from its monopoly
in steel plate-rolling. As the supplier
to Australia and New Zealand of sheet
steel for the motor vehicle and refrigera-
tor industries, also galvanised iron sheet-
ing for customers in the rural and
building sectors, John Lysaght was ex-
pected to share solidly in the current
economic recovery. This argument
particularly was aligned with the motor
vehicle boom.
But the drop in overseas steel prices
encouraged increased imports, notably
in the automotive industry. It also
affected exports. Reduced prices of un-
coated products applied from the start
of 1963, the company reports, so its
trading reflects the relatively quieter
period of early 1963.
The £808,627 fall in net profit to
£2,436,322 reduces earning rate from
20.9 p.c. to 15.5 p.c. still well above
the 12.3 p.c. achieved in 1961 but well
below the 23.6 p.c. of 1960.
Latest profit rate provides adequate
cover for the 10 p.c. ordinary dividend,
but John Lysaght will not be permitted
to take things easy while the current
world competition exists from over-
supply of sheet steel.
Its share market price fell below BHP
but the 10 p.c. dividend gives it a
margin over BHP for income yield.
This factor probably would influence
investors to take advantage of lower
share prices after the report of a profit
setback.


INVESTMENT SECTION
Portrait of Transport Development Group
Way for Cargo Distributors takeover now open
A large proportion of Cargo Distribu-
tors’ shareholders must by now be
agog to receive the formal takeover pros-
pectus from Transport Development
Group Ltd, of London. Their directors,
slightly superior but conscientiously pro-
tective, had withheld complete approval
of the bid until assured that the English
group's profitability and financial stabi-
lity did not take any knocks during 1963.
The hurdle has been whisked away in
a distinctly glamorous manner.
Transport Development can flaunt a
12 p.c. advance in consolidated net pro-
fit for the year to December from
£5tg1,304,178 to £stgl ,461,541 after
25 p.c. and 24 p.c. increases in deprecia-
tion and taxation respectively. The re-
sult is further sweetened by bringing
dividend to 13 p.c., following two years
at 121 p.c.
The gilding does not stop here, how-
ever. Another bonus issue, at one-for-
four, caps the remarkable record of
seven issues, including five bonus, since
1958. Cargo shareholders take this
benefit too.
They have, of course, seen the ss.
shares go to 21s. 3d. on the strength
of the offer, whose direct cash arm
totals 20s. (Aust.) a share and whose
combined share and cash arm represents
a present value of about 225. Cargo
shares reached a top at 15s. 3d. last
year and have not been under 15s.
during 1964.
The Transport Development results
may largely speak for themselves to most
Cargo shareholders. It is well, though,
for them to learn exactly what they are
getting, on top of the evident prosperity
of transporters in Australia.
A thorough foretaste of the prospec-
tus picture is to hand from a Sydney
broker, replete with recommendation yet
also containing plenty of solid support
for that attitude.
So far as future investment dealings
are concerned, successful acquisition
of Cargo will lead Transport to seek
Sydney and Melbourne listing. “Shares
on Australian registers will not be inter-
changeable with those on English regis-
ters except with approval obtained from
the Exchange Control Department of
the Reserve Bank of Australia.”
The usual taxation complications of
Anglo-Australian shareholdings ensue,
yet the net effect means only Australian
tax payments on Transport dividends.
Anyhow, investors should start becom-
ing used to such procedures, since it is
quite possible that the English takeover
wave will gather force during the next
year or two.
Both political and economic develop-
ments make that programme highly
feasible.
While on politics, it is useful to dis-
cover that Transport directors have al-
ready examined the chances of trans-
port nationalisation if the UK Govern-
ment changes. The chairman, Mr P. S.
Henman, points out that “between 1947
and 1953 it was only the long-distance
haulage companies which were affected”.
“Short-distance haulage, certain types
of contract hire and other specialised
forms of activity continued in private
ownership. Thus, if the pattern of
nationalisation were to be repeated,
while some haulage companies might be
affected, there would remain in the
ownership of the Group many active
and profitable concerns which in 1962
earned profits totalling almost
£stg 1,700,000 before tax”, he consol-
ingly adds.
Capital released in this (unlikely)
manner could be used advantageously
by the Group.
Turnover figures don’t appear to be
available yet for 1963, but sales climbed
from £2.9 to £15.7 million between
1957 and 1962. Contributions to pre-
tax profits in 1962 came from haulage
42.3 p.c.; storage 31.2 p.c.; shipping,
packing and other transport services
10 p.c.; miscellaneous 9.5 p.c.; lighter-
age 6.6 p.c.
Funds will be directed towards the
expansion of Cargo Distributors after
the takeover. Other transport com-
panies might then enter the firing line!
Getting Quarts from Pint Pots
VTow that the once-notorious Carlton
and United Breweries’ “Z” shares
have been granted official status, both
shareholders and investors alike must de-
cide between CUB scrip or the shares
of the listed holding companies as the
most successful means of making
money.
The following figures have been ex-
tracted from a table compiled by a
Melbourne broker:—
Book val.
Value of CUB at of other Mkt.
Co. 76/- 77/- 78/- net assets Price
B'rat 10/- 25/4 25/8 26/- 10/11 (a) 34/-

S'rock 10/- 39/10 40/4 40/10 1/2 37/-
(a) After allowing for £250,000 pref. capital.
The values given for each share, if
CUB is at a certain. price, have been
calculated on the holdings of the various
companies after they receive their one-
for-two bonus. Ballarat Brewing is in-
cluded in the list although it owns no
ordinary shares because its holdings of
Z scrip totals half a million units.
By adding the appropriate figure in
the second column to the value of the
other assets we see that every company
is apparently underpriced according to
its true worth. However, this under-
pricing is not really a factor to warrant
preference for the holding companies
rather than CUB, as brokers have re-
cently calculated that the latter’s net
tangible assets backing on present day
values is somewhere between £6 and
£7.
Assets backing is the only statistical
score in which CUB or any other com-
pany dominates to any significant de-
gree. The market yields for the whole
group fall between the 2.5 and 3.5 p.c.
level.
As statistical comparisons can vary
enormously in the long run, it seems
logical that the key to picking the best
performer in future years lies in a study
of the other operations carried on by
each company.
Carlton Brewery offers the most solid
investment as it holds more than 26 p.c.
of CUB’s capital in addition to thirteen
hotel freeholds in Wonthaggi, Sheppar-
ton and the Melbourne suburbs.
At the other end of the scale we have

the more speculative Cohn Bros, for
the brewery investor who prefers to be
a bit more daring. The company holds
only about 4 p.c. of CUB so its profit
is not so dependent (or secure, which
ever way you look at it) on CUB divi-
dends as Carlton’s.
Because Cohn is the least reliant on
CUB’s performance it may well show
the best record in future years. None
of the other companies have such a
range of outside interests.
If CUB does do really well in future
years then Carlton and Melbourne
should benefit greatly because of their
big holdings. But the five other small
holders will not be so generously en-
dowed through CUB’s performance.
That is why Cohn Bros, looks the most
attractive of them. It may even be bet-
ter than the two large shareholders if
CUB continues, as expected, along the
present steady lines while Cohn lifts
profits from its other activities.
WRC Empire Flourishes
A ll is serene on each W. R. Carpenter
front, directors infer from their in-
terim report on trading for the first half
of 1963-64.
Production and commodity and pro-
duce prices have been maintained at
“good profitable levels” which contribu-
ted to higher merchandise turnover,
directors reported.
Balance date of September 30 is being
brought forward to June 30 to synchro-
nise balance dates of manufacturing and
trading companies. The exception will
be Southern Pacific Insurance Co. Ltd
which closes its books on March 31,
and is separately listed on the Exchange.
The shares, now at 345. 7d., are only
Is. sd. less than at the beginning of
November, three weeks before the one-
for-four bonus was announced.
As the 15 p.c. is being held on the
higher capital, the present yield is 2.1
p.c.
Valiants Safely Parked
“Valiant” parked itself
firmly in the new-car market in the
year to November 30 last. The com-
pany recently reported that registrations
rose 38.6 p.c. in comparison with a 15.8
p.c. lift by the overall Australian market.
The new, sleekly-lined model is at pre-
sent proving more popular than the ori-
ginal “bulldoggy” look, according to in-
formed circles, so the company should
be making further inroads this year.
The fact that profits tumbled from
£504,965 to £212,883 in the latest year
does not contradict the car’s success or
the fact that sales reached new peaks.
The main reason for this is the tax
which took £289,000 compared with nil
in 1962. In addition, the depreciation
charge jumped from £506,840 to
£1,098,180. Abnormal expenses were
borne because of expansion and reorga-
nisation.
RMC Programme
A fter a 2s. return of capital, Ready
Mixed Concrete shareholders have
been promised (subject to no adversities)
a dividend of 63d. per 3s. share (18.05
p.c.) compared with 71d. on the old ss.
shares (12+ p.c.).
What is more, the prospect of future
increases is dangled before their eyes,
“on progressive implementation of the
group’s expansion”.
The new rate does not apply until
interim and final dividends in respect of
1963-64 profit are out of the way in
September, 1964. Deducting the capital
yield on the new divi-
dend rate from a current purchase at
13s. 7d. would be 4.6 p.c.
Thanks to considerably better trading
in Australia, the RMC group (excluding
RMC of UK) earned £556,000 after
tax in the six months to December, 1963,
compared with £472,000 and £588,000
in the two preceding half-year periods
ending June, 1963, and December, 1962,
when UK profits were included.
In a circular to shareholders dated
March 11, 1964, directors rather pointed-
ly drew attention to the fact that the
return of 2s. capital would leave RMC
with £412,988 more for development
than under their original plan (rejected
by shareholders) to set up an under-
writing and development company with
£5.7 million proceeds from the sale of
interests in RMC (UK).
A three-year programme of develop-
ment has been formulated by manage-
ment, and directors consider it neces-
sary to retain the £3.35 million for its
implementation and to improve earn-
ing capacity.
The money will be used not only to
buy capital assets but to financially
assist approved contractors tendering for
certain civil engineering projects. (Civil
authorities now want the benefit of
extended terms of payment.)
Tenders will shortly be called for
£1.5 million worth of contracts of this
kind, and £2 million worth have been
completed or are now in progress.
A Crest of Profitability
Tt looks as if Crestknit Industries could
A be in the running to maintain last
year's 20 p.c. earning rate on capital
which has subsequently been increased
by £112,198 to £424,590 through a one-
for-four par issue. The interim an-
nouncement from the Melbourne knit-
wear manufacturing group reported re-
cord sales and profits in the December
half-year.
Sales in the current half-year will be
further boosted by the recent cash ac-
quisition of the Sargood Gardiner sub-
sidiary which manufactures the well-
established “Top Dog” brand of shirts
and pyjamas.
If the new acquisition proves valuable,
then there is every chance that earnings
will be maintained. In any case, profits
are sure to climb back over the buoyant
1960 level of £70,000. Last year they
reached £65,000, staging a substantial
recovery from the £38,000 of 1962 and
£36,000 of 1961.
Amplification Needed
HThe directors of Dowell Australia are
antagonising their shareholders by
not revealing the rate of profit earned
in the half-year to December 31. This
might have been regarded as a “must”,
seeing the company lost £6579 in 1962-
63 and omitted dividend after 11 p.c.

had been distributed in the previous year
from a £73,538 profit.
Last week’s interim report merely
stated that in view of the “small” profit
achieved directors would not recommend
an interim payout. The vague statement
tells the shareholders “sweet nothing”.
The fact that the directors consider
prospects for the rest of the year as
“encouraging” does not help things very
much because they preceded this com-
ment by saying that competition was
still severe. As far as can be seen,
things are not good in the camp of this
Melburnian metal window and door
frame manufacturer.
Preston’s Profit Pruned
Tt was rather a blow last week when
Preston Motors announced a profit
dip from £313,000 to £305,000 during
their 1963 calendar year. The firm distri-
butes Holdens, Chevrolets and Buicks in
the Melbourne metropolitan area.
This was a disappointing result, especi-
ally as the chairman told shareholders at
last year’s annual meeting that increased
sales were anticipated and that the 1963
Holden range had had a “splendid public
acceptance”. As this fact is undoubtedly
true, then one must conclude that the
group’s profitability is suffering from in-
creased costs.
But directors made no mention of this
in their preliminary announcement.
Instead, they pointed out, first, that the
1962 result benefited from the tax losses
of some newly acquired subsidiaries, and,
secondly, that the 1963 figure was subject
to a new charge—£B9,l32 for a special
amortisation.
This is all very well, but tax and
depreciation provisions were lower this
year than in 1962. The net effect can
be seen by adding the 1962 tax and
depreciation figures (£272,722) and com-
paring this sum with the same provisions
for 1963 plus the new amortisation
(£294,730).
So, these charges have increased by
only £22,008 during the year—a figure
which can be regarded as purely average
in the normal course of expansion and
development.
Anyway, despite this unencouraging
result, Preston Motors should go on
proving as lucrative an investment in the
future as it has in the past. Directors
have always been very generous.. Last
year dividend was 22\ p.c. Then a one-
for-two bonus was made. This year’s
dividend on the increased capital is 15
p.c. which is more than adequately cov-
ered by the earnings of 35.9 p.c.
AWA Signal Loud anti Clear
It 275. 6d. the ss. shares of Amalga-
mated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd
appear rather vulnerable.
Although the chairman (Sir Lionel
Hooke) intimated in mid-December that
rapid technological progress in the elec-
tronic industry might necessitate the
company conserving funds for develop-
ment a broad hint that the 16 p.c.
dividend could not be counted on with
certainty this year the market seems
to expect another 6 p.c. bonus on top
of the basic 10 p.c.
The yield from a 16 p.c. dividend
would be only 2.9 p.c., and if the com-
pany reverted to the 14 p.c. rate paid
in the years 1960-61 and 1961-62, the
income return from a present purchase
would be only 2.5 p.c.
Directors last week notified share-
holders that overall operations of the
group were “maintained at a satisfac-
tory level”, although consumer products
trading was very competitive in condi-
tions of fluctuating demand.
The other divisions of AWA’s business
engineering products, marine and
navigation equipment, broadcasting, and
data preparation equipment are more
dependable and predictable profit earn-
ers with great potential.
But from an investment viewpoint it
does not pay to anticipate the future too
far. AWA shareholders have been
warned.
Too’ee Again
Interim report from Tooheys Ltd
simply stating that sales and pro-
fits were higher in the six months to
January 31 gives no inkling of how good
this achievement is.
Last year to July the company, which
is the third biggest brewer in Australia
as well as a hotel proprietor, reported
far and away its best result of £686,785
(previous best £425,192 in 1959-60).
The earning rate recovered from 7.3
p.c. to 10.4 p.c. which was close to the
rate regularly earned before conversion
of £2.4 million notes in 1962.
Rather surprisingly, the usual 9 p.c.
dividend was trimmed to 8 p.c. in 1962-
63 to retain funds for reorganisation,
and this is continued with a 4 p.c. in-
terim.
Investors who bought in last year
around the low of 7s. 3d. can shout
“Too’ee” for the present price of about
4s. higher.
Nonetheless, R. W. Miller, which is
also a collier and haulier, is the only
brewing stock with a longer yield than
Tooheys’ 3.6 p.c.

CHAIRMAN'S
Annual Review
FOR YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 1963
BRITISH TOBACCO COMPANY
(AUSTRALIA) LIMITED
In his ANNUAL REVIEW for the year ended
October 31, 1963, the Chairman (Mr. T. J. N.
Foley) reported to stockholders:
The improvement in your company’s trad-
ing results, which became evident in 1962,
showed steady progress throughout the year
and the consolidated profit for that period
from all sources amounted to £3,939,383,
after making adequate provision for deprecia-
tion on buildings, plant and machinery. The
amount set aside for income tax was
£1,431,963, resulting in a consolidated profit
after tax of £2,507,420. This compares with
£2,453,008 in the previous year but when
profit on the sale of assets is excluded from
each year’s figures the net operating income
of your company in the year ended 31st
October, 1963, was £2,505,368 or £234,035
higher than in the previous year.
In view of this encouraging improvement in
the company’s net operating income your
directors increased from nine and one-half
per cent to ten per cent the dividends paid
on ordinary and “B” ordinary stock. The
total dividend requirements were £1,995,261,
leaving £512,159 of the year’s net profit to
be added to reserves and accumulated profits.
• Much of the increase in profit for the
year has been due to a gain in the overall
level of the company’s cigarette sales. After
a number of years of sharp decline in the
sale of non-filter cigarettes the fall in 1962/
63 was of a considerably less degree and
since our brands of filter-tipped cigarettes
continued to make steady progress, being
successful in capturing more than 50% of
the overall market-increase in filter sales, the
net result has been a quite promising rise
in sales which is evidence of brighter pros-
pects for the future. The two brands which
have contributed most to this situation are
CRAVEN FILTER and COUNTRY LIFE, the
latter, although extended to national distribu-
tion only in July, having attained major status
in the market by the end of 1963. There is.
of course, stil' the problem of the decline
in the use of "roll-vour-own” cigarette tobacco
as more smokers change to machine-made
cigarettes. The use of pipe tobacco, on the
other hand, maintains its popularity and
the market for pipe tobacco showed a small
increase in 1963 With new brands and pack-
ings in this field, including IMPERIAL
CROWN Aromatic Pipe Tobacco, we have
been able to gain a proportionate share of
this increase Cigar sales are higher than a
year ago and vour company’s brands have
retained their majority share of the total
market in Australia which, of course,
includes a considerable proportion of imports.
The MONOPOLE range, modernised in design
and style of packaging during the year,
and MIDWAY Little Cigars are still the
leaders in their respective sections of the
market.
The reorganisation of sales branch activi-
ties, with particular emphasis on the dis-
tribution of goods through van delivery
services, has now been completed in all
States and has added considerably to the
efficiency both of the sales promotion groups
and the work of distribution. A slight delay
was caused in the development of the Mayne
Junction site for the Brisbane warehouse
and van selling depot through the acquisition
of additional land adjoining the original
block. This called for a re-design of the
site layout but, nevertheless, the new build-
ings will be completed and occupied during
1964.
During the year a cigarette factory was
established at Madang as part of a plan to
develop our share of the small but growing
market in the Territory of Papua and New
Guinea. This venture, with the approval
and support of the Territory Administration,
involved the first endeavour to manufacture
cigarettes locally and has been most success-
ful. W T ithin three months sales of PLAYERS
GOLD LEAF King Size Filters have reached
a profitable level and it has become necessary
to extend the factory, both to increase pro-
duction and to house primary processing
equipment as the next stage in the develop-
ment of this new industry in the Territory.
Success has also attended the company’s
operations in Fiji, which are conducted in
partnership with British-American Tobacco
Company Limited, London. Rising sales and
increasing production in that area have made
it necessary to build a new factory for
cigarette and tobacco manufacture which was
opened in October and is proving to be a
most efficient unit.
• The Commonwealth Government’s regu-
lations governing the production and use of
Australian-grown tobacco leaf continue to
be as unsatisfactory as ever. The controls
in force are still causing a great deal of con-
cern in the industry and manufacturers and
growers alike have, during the past year,
attended meetings with Government depart-
mental officials in the belief that changes
in the existing regulations are necessary
if the long-term stability of the leaf-growing
industry in the country is to be secured.
Unfortunately, very little real progress can
be reported. Alternative methods of giving
basic support of efficient leaf growers without,
as the present system does, providing an in-
centive for the uneconomic expansion of the
industry were put forward by manufactur-
ers in the series of discussions with growers’
representatives and departmental officials.
When it became clear that certain differences
of opinion could not be, resolved, it was
agreed in October that a full report of these
discussions be referred to the Government
for urgent consideration prior to the com-
mencement of the selling season in March,
1964. The manufacturers’ viewpoint which is
not ungenerous to the growers, has been
clearly stated and we believe that the Com-
monwealth Government now has a firm
responsibility to act impartially in the econ-
omic interests of all sections of the industry
and of the public generally
• The project for the erection in Macquarie
Street, Sydney, of a head office building has
progressed through most of the preliminary
stages and approvals have been obtained
for a building consisting of sixteen floors
and two car-park basements’ The demolition
of existing buildings on the site, immediately
north of the Cahill Expressway, is now in
progress and the schedule provides for com-
pletion of the building in the latter half
of 1965.
• Two developments occurred during the
year in the company’s printing and packag-
ing division. In December, 1962, negotiations
were completed for the purchase on a cash
basis of all the shares in Asher & Co. Pro-
prietary Limited. This company operates as
cheque and security printers in a well-equip-
ped modern factory at Blackburn, a suburb
of Melbourne.
Then, in September, 1963, the directors of
British Tobacco Company (Australia) Limited
and of Mardon International Limited of
England announced the completion of ar-
rangements between their two companies to
become associated in a new company which
consolidates the various interests in printing
and packaging operations previously held by
S. T. Leigh & Co. Pty. Limited. The name
of the new company is Leigh-Mardon Pty.
Limited, with an issued capital of £4,500,000,
in which Mardon International Limited holds
a substantial minority interest. Mardon
International Limited is owned jointly by
The Imperial Tobacco Company (of Great
Britain & Ireland) Limited and British-
American Tobacco Company Limited and was
formed in July, 1962, with the object of
expanding the printing and packaging inter-
ests of these two companies in the United
Kingdom and overseas.
Leigh-Mardon Pty. Limited will operate
under the names of the separate companies
of the former S. T. Leigh Group and the
trading policies and relations with customers
will not in any way be affected. It is antici-
pated that the combination in Leigh-Mardon
Pty. Limited of the knowledge of the Aus-
tralian printing and packaging industry
already existent within the group with the
ready access to wider experience and tech-
nical developments in the industry in coun-
tries abroad will further, strengthen the
company in its activities in the Australian
market.
The sale to Mardon International Limited
of an interest in your company’s printing
and packaging organisation was effected on
the basis of current values of the assets of
that organisation. The amount received from
Mardon International Limited was, therefore,
in excess of the book value of the proportion
of the net assets sold and this has caused a
significant movement in interest of outside
shareholders in subsidiary companies and in
trade marks and goodwill. Whilst there has
been a transfer of portion of stockholders’
equity to our new partners, the price at
which the transfer was effected has resulted
in an increase in the net tangible assets
backing of your company’s stock.
• Further expansion has occurred in the
pastoral activities of your company. Naroo
Pastoral Company Pty. Limited was formed
in 1960 in association with British-American
Tobacco Company Limited, of London, to
acquire “Glenrock” Station in New South
Wales. The two principal contributors each
had 43% of the issued capital of £A500,000.
The balance of the issued capital was sub-
scribed at par by directors and certain
employees of your company and of British-
American Tobacco Company Limited.
With the acquisition of “Jemalong” and,
more recently, ‘’Mungadal” Stations, the title
to this latter having been transferred on
22nd January, 1964, it has become necessary
to increase the capital of Naroo Pastoral
Company Pty. Limited to £A1,500,000, so
reducing the company’s dependence on loan
money to finance development. Your company
and British-American Tobacco Company
Limited have subscribed equal proportions of
the increase in capital.
All three of these properties are being
developed to a co-ordinated plan and your
directors are pleased to report that, although
no immediate dividend return is to be expect-
ed from this investment, the company is
now operating at a profit and current indica-
tions are that it will prove to be a most
satisfactory investment.
In addition to the three New South Wales
properties of Naroo, your company acquired,
late in 1963, a 70,000-acre area in North-East
Tasmania known as “Icena Estate’’. This
estate consists partly of freehold land and
partly of leasehold areas capable of conver-
sion to freehold tenure, and it is planned
to develop and improve the land for pastoral
and mixed farming pursuits in a programme
which will extend over a number of years.
• Your company’s partnership with Ameri-
can Machine & Foundry Company of New
York was reorganised during the year on a
basis of a 50% holding in American Machine
& Foundry Company (Aust.) Pty. Limited,
which company now encompasses the entire
AMF operations in Australasia. Expansion
was continued v/ith the opening of new AMF-
tenpin bowling centres and with the develop-
ment of new products at the company’s
Northmead factory. The bowling industry is,
at present, not valued highly by the share
market, as evidenced by the market price of
shares in the public companies conducting
bowling centres, but the programme of instal-
ling new lanes and pin spotting machines
in new bowling centres is still progressing
steadily and the numbers of regular players
of the sport continue to grow at a satis-
factory, if not spectacular, rate. There is
every indication that in the next few years,
as the sport becomes more completely organ-
ised and the standard of play rises towards
international levels, the game of tenpin
bowling will become an integral part of the
life of a large number of Australians and the
industry will be judged a success in all of
its phases. In the machinery manufacturing
operations, the most interesting item was
the manufacture and sale to Japanese com-
panies of two large bread-baking and bread-
handling installations. These have, in the
fourth quarter of 1963, been shipped and are
expected to be in operation by February,
1964. It is anticipated that this venture into
export trade will bring wider contacts and
increased sales to Japanese industry.
« Your directors are confident that progress
of a very real nature has been made during
the year in all sections of the company’s
varied activities. Once again, it is emphasised
that there is no room for complacency or
over-confidence but there is reason to believe
that, despite problems and difficulties which
will undoubtedly arise during 1964. the com-
pany should experience a satisfactory year.

Customize is increasing
this man’s life assurance policy
That's what we mean by “Guaranteed Insurability”!
Four years ago, at age 36, this
man took out a Customlife policy,
with guaranteed insurability.
Today, although stricken with a
heart attack, he is exercising his
option to increase his cover by
£5,000 —the amount of his
original insurance.
It is granted without question.
Without penalty rate.
This option is possible through
our “Guaranteed Insurability”
plan. Briefly, it guarantees you
the right to increase your life
assurance cover periodically with-
out the need for further medical
examination —regardless of the
state of your health at any of the
option dates.
Customlife realises that one cannot
depend on constant good health, and,
realising this, provides for your protection
in the event of any illness at any time.
Let’s look at specifics:
From birth to age 40, it is possible for
you to increase the cover on your life
five times. Option dates exist at ages 24,
28, 32, 36 and 40 to increase cover by
an amount not exceeding the original sum
assured . . . which can be up to £5,000.
Thus, taking advantage of all options,
you have a maximum amount purchas-
able of £30,000, with only the one
medical examination when the initial
policy is taken out.
m
Even if you should delay to, say, age 35,
you still have two further option dates.
Perhaps you are thirty now; you have a
young family and a responsibility for
their future and your own. You can
take out an initial policy for any amount
up to £5,000, and increase it as you will
at the option dates, with no fear of
refusal on medical grounds.
The coverage, of course, applies to
women, too. The same complete protec-
tion applies to you as a career woman,
or a young wife sharing family responsi-
bilities.
This is worry-free security, enabling you
to plan for the future with a new
confidence.
You can have more specific details of
this Life Assurance plan by contacting
your nearest Customlife office (listed
below). If you have delayed buying life
assurance, this may be the wisest time for
you to move. Customlife will tailor a
policy to your requirements immediately.

share capital, because its debenture
capital must not exceed six times
shareholders’ funds nor four-fifths of
current assets, whichever is the lesser.
It can be predicted with reasonable
certainty that FCA’s next call for capital
will be within two years, and be a one-
for-six at par 10s., payable in two in-
stalments of ss.
Cum the one-for-five issue to share-
holders as at April 17, the shares have
been offered around 265. where the
eventual yield on an invariable 10 p.c.
dividend would be 4.2 p.c.
Norwest Passage Easy
A lthough defeated on a show of hands
at an extraordinary meeting on
March 11, a poll ratified the proposal
of directors of Project Development Cor-
poration Ltd to acquire an 80 p.c. in-
terest in Norwest Development Corpora-
tion Ltd for £474,000 from the mana-
ging director, Mr E. S. Clementson.
Voting was 50,694 votes in favor
and 3690 against the motion. The ratio
was 93.21 p.c. in favor. Directors de-
clared that with the votes of Mr Cle-
mentson and Tangible Securities Ltd, the
vote in favor of the motion was 84.97
p.c.
Now Norwest will proceed to buy the
Broome and Derby meatworks and cattle
stations, from which it expects, accord-
ing to PDC calculations, to earn about
£133,000 a year.
Now it's up to PDC to fulfil Norwest
expectations. Shareholders will follow
closely meatworks and station develop-
ment.
E. A. Greenwood Recovers
TAirectors of E. A. Greenwood Ltd,
softgoods wholesaler, predict that
results for this year to June will exceed
last year’s.
Shareholders can, therefore, expect at
least partial recovery of the earning rate
which last year slackened from 36 to
30.2 p.c.
Sales in the first half of this fiscal
year were up 10 p.c.
Alliance with Ret. Acceptance
A lliance Holdings Ltd, hire-pur-
chase financier affiliated with the
MLC, is in expansive mood. It has
made a flat offer of 4s. 6d. cash per
ss. share in Retailers Acceptance Ltd.
These shares have been languishing on
the market at between 2s. and 3s.
As one of the smaller financiers
(capital £375,000), without a banking or
assurance godparent, Retailers Accept-
ance has suffered a three-year profit de-
cline. The last result gave an earning
rate of 10.2 p.c., from which an 8 p.c.
dividend was paid.
Alliance opened an Adelaide branch
in the first half of the current year, and
it also formed a joint company with
Holidaywise Ltd to take over from
Latec Investments Ltd the Florida
Hotel, the Terrigal Hotel, a shopping
arcade, guesthouse and land at Terrigal
on the central NSW coast.
Alliance ss. shares are currently
valued at 10s. 10d., to yield 4.6 p.c.
which puts the company well up the
scale of hire-purchase financiers. Per-
haps unfortunately for Retailers Accept-
ance shareholders, no alternative share
offer was made.
Firnls in the Scrap Heap
Ocrap metal merchant Albert G. Sims
Ltd has so improved its level of
earnings and liquidity in the six months
to December, 1963, that arrears of pre-
ference dividends carried over from
1962-63 only will now be paid. This
will involve £lB,OOO.
Profit was £207,596 before tax, but
after providing £82,470 for deprecia-
tion. Compare this with the losses of
the two preceding full years: £155,119
in 1962-63 and £292,697 in 1961-62.
Liquidity has improved by over
£900,000 following the sale of the
MV Wanganella and some of the Morts
Dock land. Several companies are now
showing interest in the balance of this
land, which will be sold subject to a
satisfactory offer.
Sims was very successful until 1960-
61 when it diversified into Hong Kong
shipping, a Melbourne pig-iron plant and
a hardware business, and was involved in
litigation over the Morts Dock property.
Although the metal market can be
variable, Sims should be able to re-
establish its reputation, so the ss. shares
at around 4s. 4d. are not without pros-
pect.
The last dividend paid to ordinary
shareholders was 6j p.c. in 1960-61,
after 10 years of 10 p.c. A modest dis-
tribution could perhaps be made this
time next year.
Driving for a Dividend
Tf the trend exhibited by Melbourne-
based Australian Motor Industries
since the 1961 collapse continues along
present lines, the shares would prove
good buying at the current price levels
which are half of the ss. par value.
In 1961 earnings reverted from the
1960 profit of £281.000 (in round
figures) to a loss of £2,054,000. Need-
less to say, dividend was omitted. In
1960 it had been 10 p.c. In 1962 the
loss was cut back to £378,000 and last
year it was only £58,000.
The first six months of the current
term produced a profit — exactly what
figure is unknown. But it is certain that
the company has entered the final stages
of recovery and, although no dividend
may be forthcoming this year, the 1965
result could warrant some payment.
That is, if it is in line with the current
recovery trend.
Japanese vehicles are rapidly making
inroads on the Australian market and
AMI should be helped considerably by
any further improvement in Toyota sales.
It also handles Triumph cars which make '
the successful Spitfire sports car.
Engineer’s Sales Hoisted
Oales of Sydney manufacturing and
chemical engineer W. J. Manufactur-
ing Co. Ltd, rose by 66 p.c. in the
December half-year, but of this 50 p.c.
was attributable to the new subsidiary,
Waratah Chemicals Pty Ltd.
Directors expect no trouble in hold-
ing the 10 p.c. dividend on capital en-
larged by a one-for-four premium issue.
The new shares, anyway, rank only for
the final dividend in 1963-64.
W. J. is yet another company to com-
plain of higher wage costs, which are
putting the squeeze on profit margins.
The company continues to consolidate
at Brookvale (NSW), and directors re-
ported that a large quantity of un-
delivered orders justified their decision
to increase capacity in the industrial
materials (laminates for heavy engineer-
ing and automotive industries) division.
Other products are industrial, frictional
and building materials, industrial chemi-
cals, fibreglass, textiles and engineering
equipment.
The 10s. shares yield 4.8 p.c. from a
present purchase of 20s. 9d. The earn-
ings yield calculated on last year's rate
of 20.9 p.c., is an attractive 10.1 p.c.
Perhaps 1963-64 may not produce
maximum profit, but the following year
the benefits of consolidation should be
evident.
Mr Whelan and the barristers
Tn the issue of March 14 (page 53) a
-*■ statement by Mr J. G. Whelan in
an address to the Victorian branch of
the Chartered Institute of Secretaries
was misconstrued to mean that the per-
ception and understanding of barristers
on matters of company law left much to
be desired. Mr Whelan was actually
stressing ‘'the importance of an under-
standing by counsel and court officers
of the principles involved in the ac-
counts presented before the courts and
principles of auditing”.

Fleecy-lined Future for Brokers
Tt has been generally accepted that the woolbroking firms
A later this year will be reporting fairly big profit increases
for the 1963-64 term. In fact, the current prosperity of the
rural industry will enable most of them to chalk-up record
results.
The latest figures showing the returns from Australian wool
auctions confirm that they must be collecting much more
brokerage than last year. In the eight month term to the end
of February wool sales came to £323.7 million. This figure
is the highest since the same term of 1956-57 and represents
a £71.9 million increase over the same term of last year.
On present indications the wool cheque for the full year
will come very close to the £483 million of 1956-57.
Such a figure would represent a healthy increase over last
year, but the wool-brokers are undoubtedly cherishing sweet
memories of the 1950-51 season when the Korean War brought
on heavy buying from the US, Britain and Russia. The wool
cheque that year climbed to a phenomenal £636 million.
Only inflation or another crisis could bring in such heavy
returns again.
Stopping the 66 Stop-Go”
Tf Australians wish to see no more of the country’s notorious
-*■ “stop-go” economics, then they must accept the regular
application of moderating pressures- by governmental authori-
ties to apprehend sharp fluctuations in the level of economic
activity. This sound viewpoint was put forward by Mr 'Stani-
forth Ricketson at the annual meeting of his company, Capel
Court Investment, in Melbourne.
Mr Ricketson pointed out that the problems of prosperity
were perhaps less understood than those of adversity. For
this reason a slower rate of growth could be acceptable if it
guaranteed a reasonable degree of cost and price stability.
Ferment Among the Accountants
accounting and auditing professions are being healthily
brought out into the open as they adapt themselves to
contemporary business pressures. A possibility of accountants’
registration in Victoria and a Queensland demand that auditors
be obliged to report “unusual” elements in company accounts
should provoke noticeable discussion.
Spurred by “radical changes in the structure of society” the
Australian Society of Accountants has launched a survey of
professional education and admission standards. It has also
begun “to exercise a firmer supervision over the professional
conduct of members”.

Can Clyde Regain Its Fame?
But shares are not unattractive at present prices
By “SECURITY”
\ fter a period of three years Clyde
Industries Ltd has returned to the
“take-over” field. At this stage it
would be difficult to predict whether or
not the bid for Tomlinson Steel Ltd will
be successful, and there can be little
doubt that the 1961 Companies Act has
made the practice of the “art” rather
more difficult.
It will be interesting to see if the
“ace take-over company” (as Clyde was
called by one financial writer in mid-
-1960) can regain the title. But there is
one other factor which makes Clyde's
task much more difficult now than in
1960.
In June. 1960, the last sale of Clyde’s
ordinary shares took place at 18s. 3d.
and prices had ranged between 20s. and
17s. during the first six months of that
year. The issued ordinary capital at
that time consisted of 12.363,762 shares
and therefore the market value was
nearly £11.3 million.
Today, Clyde's issued ordinary shares
total 14,332.903 and are valued by the
market at 10s. lid., making the total
market value of the ordinary capital
about £7.8 million.
The total market value of the equity
has, therefore, declined by 30 p.c. over
about four years, but, more importantly
from the take-over viewpoint, the actual
market premium per share has fallen by
more than 50 p.c.
At this stage there does not seem
much likelihood of any recovery. Having
in mind that the dividend yield at
10s. lid. is 6.9 p.c. and the earnings
yield at 8.8 p.c., one must wonder
whether the market has not written the
shares down too far.
In an excellent publication issued in
1963, the introduction states: “Clyde is
more than 100 years old, but its re-
markable expansion has occurred since
1949 when Clyde Industries Limited
was formed”. The annual report for
that year certainly presents a different
picture from the 1963 annual report.
The consolidated balance .sheets are
shown below:—
1949 1963
£'ooo % £'ooo %
Ordinary capi.al 636 25.9 3583 17.6
Reserves 235 9.5 5982 29.4
Preference capital 450 18.3 600 2.9
Minority interests 13 0.5 518 2.5
External liabiliries 1128 45.8 9701 47.6

Fixed assets 958 38.9 6525 32.0

Current assets 1419 57.7 11453 56.2
Intangible assets 35 1.4 132 0.6
2462 100.0 20384 100.0
This comparison shows that the ordi-
nary shareholders’ equity has increased
quite substantially, mainly at the ex-
pense of the preference shareholders,
and there has been a quite substantial
increase in investments.
The list of subsidiary companies has
increased markedly over these 14 years
and a few interests but only a few
seem to have disappeared. The most
notable omission is the textile group,
which in 1949 consisted of McLeod
Bolton & Co., Trugrade and Australian
Stockinette. I would imagine that the
withdrawal from this field, which seems
to have occurred before 1955, was a
wise decision. The interest in Fairey
Clyde Aviation Co. was sold to Fairey
Aviation in 1952. Other than this, the
interests held in 1949 still seem to be
held today.
The consolidated profit and loss
statements compare as follows:
£'ooo
1949 1963
Tax provided 28.8 258.8
Depreciation 44.5 456.8
Net profit after tax 38.7 716.8
Preference dividends 17.9 30.0
Ordinary dividends 36.4 537.5
Surplus (15.6) 149.3
Apart from making the comment that
the tax provision seems low in the 1963
year and accepting earnings as reported,
it would seem that per share earnings
have increased nearly sixfold. Yet
strangely enough the shares were selling
at the equivalent of ss. 4d. in Decem-
ber, 1949. and at 11s. in December,
1963.
Those shareholders who purchased
the shares at the end of 1949 were well
rewarded over the next ten years. The
market value of a constant investment
would have increased by 375 p.c., or at
an average compound rate of 17 p.c.
per annum. The dividend income from
the constant investment would , have in-
creased by 223 p.c. or at the average
compound rate of 124 p.c. per annum.
As in many instances, investors took
little notice of this remarkable growth
until it had nearly ceased and the shares
were selling at ten times earnings as
late as 1958.
After that year, per share earnings
declined and although there was a re-
covery in 1960, the recession years of
1961 and 1962 brought about a 30 p.c.
fall, while from November, 1959, to
November, 1963, the market value fell
by nearly 40 p.c. These figures are
all based on a theoretical constant in-
vestment, which means that prices and
earnings have been adjusted for new
issues.
We have, then, the picture of a com-
pany whose shares have certainly lost
favor with investors and once this has
happened it is frequently difficult to
regain that favor. Currently, it seems
likely that the group as a whole is
doing well.
Judging by Press releases over the last
12 months, it would be expected the
heavy engineering side would be opera-
ting at higher levels than it has been for
some time, and the bid for Tomlinson
suggests that Clyde believes that this
field has long-term prospects.
To the extent that Clyde is involved
in the automotive industry through sub-
sidiaries such as Apac and Clyde Bat-
teries, one would expect better profits
from these activities.
Some concern must be felt regarding
the future of the financing subsidiaries,
particularly as the consolidated accounts
of the group showed that nearly <£l.3
million of debentures, notes, deposits
and other loans would fall due for re-
payment or renewal before June 30,
1964.
From the income viewpoint, prior
charges in the form of interest and pre-
ference dividends were covered frac-
tionally over three times by the 1962-
63 profit and at this stage the 15 p.c.
dividend rate on ordinary capital does
not appear to be in any danger.
While the growth of the ’fifties may
never be repeated so far as Clyde In-
dustries is concerned, the shares are
not unattractive at current prices to
show a yield of 6.9 p.c. covered nearly
1.3 times by reported earnings.
One thing that is clear from the past
record is that the board has passed on
benefits very quickly to shareholders.
Evidence of this is in the bonus issues
in successive years in 1954 and 1955,
followed by a 25 p.c. increase in the
dividend rate in 1956.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
The Troubles of Courtaulds
Long struggle for respectable profit
problems of Courtaulds (Austra-
lia) Ltd are twofold: Competition
from overseas fibremakers and the fairly
recent advent of nylon tyre-cord pro-
ducers on the Australian scene.
Courtauld's major investment is in
rayon tyre cord, and the year before
last Courtauld’s admitted that over 85
p.c. of all tyres produced in Australia
were reinforced with Courtauld’s viscose
rayon tyre cord.
The trend overseas is for nylon to
make heavy inroads on the rayon tyre-
cord market, and when plans were
announced for the establishment of two
nylon tyre-cord plants in Australia
(Fibremaker Ltd in Melbourne and
Allied Chemicals of Australia Pty in
Sydney), Courtaulds came out with a
high tenacity rayon tyre-cord marketed
under the name “Tyrex”.
Now directors have advised Court-
aulds’ shareholders that the growing
competition in the tyre fabric market
has made price reductions necessary.
Although profit and sales for the first
half of 1963-64 were slightly ahead of
the previous corresponding period, a
lower profit is anticipated for the second
half.
Interim dividend has, therefore, been
trimmed from 3J to 3J p.c. Of course,
conditions may not be as bad as feared,
so that last year’s total payment of 7i
p.c. could be repeated; but directors are
playing it safe, so investors are justi-
fiably cautious.
Result of trading for the year 1962-
63 was a profit of £756,649 after pro-
viding <£484,000 for tax and £450,537
for depreciation. The record profit repre-
sented 11.5 p.c. on capital.
Courtauld's (Australia) was formed in
1949 under the sponsorship of Court-
aulds of the UK, which holds the de-
ferred capital of £675,000 (converting
to ordinary shares in 1974) and some
of the £6,169,000 ordinary capital.
A plant at Tomago (NSW), 15 miles
up the Hunter River from Newcastle,
produces the tyre yarn and fabric and
the textile yarn.
Courtauld’s tyre business, of course,
suffered severely when the Government
imposed economic restrictions specifi-
cally aimed at the booming motor
vehicle industry.
The return to more stable conditions
in the motor vehicle industry in 1962-63
allowed a substantial improvement in
Courtaulds’ tyre fabric sales. Yarn is
also being used in increasingly signifi-
cant quantities for the manufacture of
industrial hose and belting, and man-
agement is vigorously exploiting other
end uses for rayon cord.
The other major product of Court-
aulds, acetate textile yarn, sold at re-
cord levels to both the weaving and
knitting industries in the last year to
June 30. Acetate is benefiting from
the present trend to the use of mixture
fabrics.
Courtaulds’ “Estacel” fabrics are be-
ing used by manufacturers of high-
quality garments.
The company asserts that there is a
need for adequate tariff protection for
efficient Australian industries such as
the textile industry, which, it says, uses
modern machinery, is a large employer
of labor and has never taken advantage
of its position to earn excessive profits.
The chairman (Mr R. J. Vicars) told
shareholders at the last annual meeting
that the protection must give a sub-
stantial margin and be of a continuing
nature, so that production could be
maintained at the highest possible
level for minimum unit costs.
During 1962-63 the Tariff Board did
not confirm the emergency duty for the
weaving section of the man-made fibre
industry. In June the Special Advisory
Authority examined the position and
the Government approved a modified
sliding scale duty which should give
better protection for the higher class
fabrics.
The company is sole Australian agent
for Lustre Fibres Ltd, yarn distributing
subsidiary for Courtaulds of England.
Its sales in 1962-63 showed improve-
ment despite competition.
Courtauids has no liquidity problems,
which is fortunate because holders of
shares which have trouble in maintain-
ing par value would not take kindly to
a call for capital. There is, however, very
little reliance to date on loan capital.
During 1962-63 £200,000 was invested
in first mortgage debenture stock of a
company listed on a prescribed Stock
Exchange, and the company at balance
date had £600,000 cash on deposit.
The company has had a long struggle
towards a respectable level of profit-
ability, and its marketing problems are
far from resolved.
The reputation of the UK parent is
such that it is not advisable to dismiss
the stock from investment calculations,
but at 17s. 9d. to yield 7.3 p.c. the 20s.
units have only limited appeal.

DODDS CONS. IND. LTD
From 80.3 p.c. Earning Rate to 4.4
a company to see its shares tumble
from a peak of 335. 6d. in 1960
to par value of ss. three years later, is
a humiliating experience.
After recording the fantastic earning
rate of 80.3 p.c., Dodds Consolidated In-
dustries Ltd made a four-for-five bonus
in October, 1959. Shareholders then with
some dismay watched the earning rate
collapse to 4.4 p.c. in 1961-62.
When a loss of £195,655 was an-
nounced for the year to June 30, 1963,
the news was iconoclastic. But some of
the damage to Dodds’ image has been
repaired in the directors’ report.
Like all large engineering contractors,
Dodds, specialising in the manufacture
and instalment of large-scale steam
generating plant and firing equipment for
Governmental electricity authorities and


large industrial companies, has an ac-
counting problem.
It adheres to a long-standing conser-
vative policy in regard to incomplete
contracts. Until contracts are com-
pleted a large provision is made out of
progress payments against performance
guarantees, so that the major part of
profits is not brought into account until
efficiency trials are successfully per-
formed.
Reference to the accompanying table
shows the value of uncompleted con-
tracts in hand. In 1961-62 the company
secured a contract with the SEC of WA
for the Muja power station, and the
following year for two boilers for the
Calcap power station for Capricornia
Regional Electricity Board in Queens-
land.
These are worth a total £4i million,
and scheduled completion dates are
August, 1967 and May, 1966 respectively.
It is worth keeping these dates in mind
as likely years for record profits.
Analysing the performance of the
various subsidiaries in 1962-63, Riley
Dodds Australia Pty Ltd (which has
manufacturing rights from the Riley
Stoker Corporation of USA), accounted
for the bulk of the loss. No substantial
contracts were finished during the year,
work being done mainly on long term
projects due in 1966 to 1968.
Profits are still being deferred on cer-
tain contracts which were referred to
the year before as experiencing some
delay in demonstrating full performance.
Other subsidiaries to operate unprofit-
ably were Alfred Snashall Pty Ltd, which
represents English and American makers
of scientific and electrical instruments,
Mechanical Handling Pty Ltd (acquired
in 1960) and the newly set-up New Zea-
land subsidiary.
Alfred Snashall found margins were
low, and it was necessary to write down
substantially the stocks of overseas equip-
ment made obsolete by rapid technical
advances.
The loss by Mechanical Handling was
only nominal.
The NZ subsidiary began operations
in October, 1962 and after 12 months
achieved break-even point.
Other subsidiaries which were profit-
able were Riley Dodds Instrumentation
Pty Ltd, RDA Workshops Pty Ltd, Lenix
Services Pty Ltd (makers of electric
hoists), Pascoe Industries Ltd (an Ade-
laide company acquired in 1961), and
Dodds Consolidated Industries (Far
East) Ltd.
Dodds recently announced 50 p.c.
higher sales in the December six months,
and a return to profitability. Although
they have no reason to believe that this
trend will be reversed in the second six
months, directors decided to pay no in-
terim dividend.
Riley Dodds has secured substantial
short term contracts including boilers
for a number of sugar companies in
Australia and Fiji, and for a large muni-
cipal incinerator. This supplements the
longer term power station work.
The ss. shares accordingly have
steamed up to 9s. Id. Should a 10 p.c.
dividend be paid as a final, repeating
the heavily reduced rate of 1961-62 the
yield from a current purchase would be
5.5 p.c.
The company obviously has the capa-
city to earn big profits, and trading ex-
perience of the last two years was the
only unhappy period in the company’s
public history.
Shareholders may never again have the
same sense of security about their in-
vestment in Dodds, but it should prove
once more to be a worthwhile holding.
Little advance on present price levels
should be expected, however, until a
return to dividends is confirmed by 1964
results.

CONKEY AND SONS LTD
Meat Exporter’s Progress
and Sons Ltd is convinced
there is a great future for boneless
beef and mutton in North America and
Japan.
The company has abattoirs at Coota-
mundra and Newcastle in NSW. Under
a long-term agreement the Producers’
Co-operative Distributing Society Ltd
distributes Conkey-manufactured goods
in Sydney, Wagga, Cootamundra, Leeton,
Goulburn and Canberra.
The shares were listed in Sydney on
June 30, 1959, a couple of months after
a one-for-three bonus. The small pre-
ference capital was cancelled and re-
placed by debentures in November, 1962.
The company has only a small capital,
but it is making its mark on investors’
minds as being a reliable profit earner,
with annual profit advances.
The 10 p.c. dividend paid for the first
two public years has been increased to
11 p.c. in the last three, and over the
last year to June, earning rate advanced
from 26.0 to 28.3 p.c. on capital.
The company has shown a deficiency
of working capital on the last two balance
dates, and the extension of bank over-
draft from £75,289 to £117,495 on June
30, 1963, plus a programme of invest-
ment in new facilities, pointed to the
imminence of fresh capital raisings.

SPECULATORS DIARY
Boom Talk Takes a Knock
Disillusioning results from Borg-Warner and J. Lysaght
TI/I-iile everyone’s talking about the
’’ booming prosperity, out come the
results of Borg-Warner and John
Lysaght. Because of the higher tax pro-
vision, Borg-Warner can be partially
excused. On the other hand John
Lysaght was simply a case of a 25 p.c.
profit fall.
The announcement knocked 10s. off
the price, providing those day-in-day-
out traders with a very good oppor-
tunity for a quick profit.
Not quite so dramatic a fall of a
share price but nevertheless significant
was Australian Chemicals (not to be
confused with Amalgamated Chemi-
cals). In this case, the share price had
been about 235. after the favorable
interim report some weeks ago. Now
it’s back to 19s. 6d.
Australian Chemicals has had mixed
success over the years. Originally the
two main subsidiaries of the group
were Reichhold Chemicals Pty Ltd and
A. C. Hatrick Pty Ltd. The main
business of the group was the pro-
duction and distribution of synthetic
resins and industrial chemicals. As a
company whose activities were con-
fined to the chemical industry it did
very well.
The move into engineering by the
takeover of Frank G. Spurway in late
1959 and then Die Casters Ltd in 1961
ushered in a sudden change of fortune.
In fact, profits were halved in 1962
and earning rate was a paltry 8 p.c.
Some recovery in profits was made
in 1963, allowing the company to raise
the dividend from 8i to 10 p.c. with
directors talking about a steady increase
in sales for the first six months, and,
with profit keeping pace, further re-
covery is fairly evident. Why, then, is
the present price of 19s. 6d. for the
10s. share only 2s. 9d. above the lowest
level for several years?
Some people may point to the recent
conversion of notes into shares as the
reason. True, this enlarges the capital.
But surely the probability of a record
profit this year more than offsets this
argument. My order was for 500
shares.
My second purchase for the week
was 500 shares in Besser Vibrapac
(Queensland) at 9s. One astute friend
Kad mentioned these shares shortly
after the annual meeting in November
last year. It needed the interim report
and the very strong Queensland build-
ing statistics to bring me into action.
Besser Vibrapac (Queensland) has
the distinction of being the only really
successful Besser company operating in
the different States of Australia.
Amongst Australian industrial com-
panies, it stands out as being one of
the select few whose plant has been
damaged by an act of sabotage.
This year’s result could be quite ex-
ceptional. All three manufacturing
centres Darra, Burleigh and Rock-
hampton are contributing to the
record sales. A second Besser machine
is to be installed at the main factory at
Darra a good indication of the in-
creased demand.
It’s the old story of how to meet the
cost of my purchases. First of all, I sold
the AVVA shares, which strangely enough
had risen to 275. 9d. after the usual
cautious interim report. Keeping com-
pany with AWA were the 200 Tutt
Bryant notes at 345. and the 500 Country
Television at 13s. 9d. These three sales
resulted in a total profit of £73.
A number of stocks in the portfolio
are standing in the books at a loss. It
becomes a case of watching the market
closely to weed them out.
The week's transactions were:
SOLD
200 Tutt Bryant £1 notes, 34/- .... £335
500 Country Television, 13/9 .... £337
200 AWA, 27/9 £273
BOUGHT
500 Australian Chemicals, 19/6 .. £498
500 Besser V. (Q’ld), 9/- £232
A debit balance of £264 stands in the
account. Things seem to have quietened
down temporarily but I’m hoping, for
some action on the tin front shortly.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
The Storm Over Irrigation
MIA an “unfulfilled vision ”
Vf/HiLE hardly anyone—except maybe
” the Eskimos —is unaware of the
possibility of world disintegration
through nuclear warfare, another kind
of threat is currently exercising the minds
of scientists in many countries.
This is the growing shortage of water,
which is fairly obviously related to the
output of food and the population
explosion.
Some quite remarkable work is being
done in Germany at the present time in
evolving machinery which will convert
sea water to fresh in sufficiently large
quantities to offset the using up of
natural water.
The detailed workings of these pro-
jected plants are complex, but the
important point is that it will be possible
to take care of the annual needs of
three million people at a cost of £45
million and it is predicted that, as the
scale of usage of these conversion units
increases, the costs could be reduced
to one-fifth.
By 1980, it is predicted, up to 10 p.c.
of the world's fresh water may come
from the conversion methods.
No one, as far as is known, has pre-
dicted how long it will take for all the
sea-water to be used up. However,
what is more important, at this time
and in this place, is a map produced in
Germany showing world water re-
sources.
Australia comes out rather badly.
\ part from the narrow strip east of the
Dividing Range, and Tasmania, the
whole of Australia is shown as either
“desert areas where irrigation is possible
only with difficutly or not at all” or
as “land which is cultivable but where
there is still a shortage of water.”
Whether we like it or not, we corre-
spond to the larger part of North
Africa, the Middle East, India and the
regions bordering Sinkiang in China.
The map is clearly generalised, but
it should make us at least think a little
more clearly about “Australia’s un-
limited future”.
Until 1947 the Commonwealth Year
Book gave the total flow of all Aus-
tralian rivers as 60 million acre feet,
which is one-fifteenth of the flow of
rivers in USA. (The Mississippi system
alone 474 million acre feet.)
Population capacity is related to
water. On these figures it would appear
that if the USA can maintain a popula-
tion of 200 million, then Australia
could maintain no more than 14 million
—and we’re not far off that now.
Since 1947, however, the compilers
of the Year Book have replaced the
total flow of 60 million acre feet with:
“Though river gaugings have been re-
corded over considerable periods in
some parts of Australia, records else-
where are intermittent, of short duration,
or non-existent. At present, therefore,
it is impossible to estimate, with any
degree of reliability, the total average
annual flow of Australian streams.’’
/Yne might ask: “If we can measure
everything from the consumption of
peanut oil to the time spent on watch-
ing TV, why can't we measure the
rivers? Is there a relationship between
the vagueness of the river flow of the
continent and the desire (since 1947)
to attract overseas capital to Australia?
It is not true that there is total un-
awareness of Australia’s real position
in relation to water resources.
Scientists had a good deal to say
about it at the recent National Sym-
posium on Water Resources held by the
Australian Academy of Science.
Visiting speaker, Professor R. K.
Linsley, head of the School of Engineer-
ing at Stanford University (USA) said:
“If there is anything I have observed
in Australia in the water field, it is that
you do lack an organised programme
of hydrologic data collection. In parti-
cular there is no single agency respon-
sible for co-ordinated collection of
stream-flow data.
“We know that the ultimate fate of
every reservoir which we build is to be
filled with sediment. Will it last long
enough for us to get value out of it?
“This is not intended as a threat
that when you build a reservoir it is
going to disappear overnight. In many
instances it will be there for several
hundred years, but we need to know
more about sediment production as it
affects reservoir design and harbors.”
On irrigation, Professor Linsley said:
“I would submit there is no compelling
reason why we should irrigate any
desert land unless we have some need
for the products that Would be derived
from it. But if the cost of providing
water is less than the benefits of land
production, then this is a wise move.
“If we have a use for the water, then
it is quite true that we should not let
it run away into the ocean. If we have
no use for it, there is absolutely no
reason why we should worry about this.
After all it isn’t going to waste. It is
going into the ocean from which it will
be evaporated and returned to us in the
not too distant future as rain.”
T)rofessor Linsley’s view on irrigation
A is timely. The matter of irrigation
is a hot topic.
Professor Linsley is clearly not against
irrigation as such. It is wise, he says,
if the cost of providing the water is
less than the benefits. Cost and benefits
are the operative words.
Other men are currently more out-
spoken.
At the recent ANZAAS Congress in
Canberra (3000 scientists from Australia
and overseas) the Research Fellow in
Economics at the School of Pacific
Studies at the Australian National Uni-
versity, Mr Bruce McFarlane, referred
to the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area
as “an unfulfilled vision” and that the
Australian population as a whole
“clearly preferred centralisation in the
cities to decentralisation”.
Farmers in the new Coleambally
irrigation area of NSW, drawing water
from the Snowy scheme, hit back with
a public meeting at Darlington Point
which condemned “attacks in academic
and banking circles on irrigation”.
Banking was included because of a
statement by the general manager of the
Commonwealth Development Bank (Mr
B. B. Callaghan) in a talk to the Pro-
ductivity Council in Melbourne. Mr
Callaghan said that Australia might
have to reconsider plans to use land to
be irrigated by the Snowy scheme. He
said:
“To be realistic in these matters a
man starting a farm today would be in
a better position if he invested his
money at 8 or 9 per cent and stayed
at home”.
Another critic of irrigation in Austra-
lia has been Economics Professor Keith
Campbell who told the National Sym-
posium on Water Resources in Can-
berra: “Government expenditure on the
extension of irrigation areas is probably
not as socially desirable as other forms
of national investment”.
Apart from the farmers, naturally
worried at this kind of criticism getting


HELP
LEGACY
all the year-
round
to politicians with a resulting drying up
of government funds, the lone defence
of irrigation in the academic sense has
come from Mr A. J. Grassby who is
secretary of the NSW Government and
CSIRO-sponsored Irrigation Research
and Extension Committee of the Mur-
rumbidgee Irrigation Areas.
Mr Grassby has said that the figures
quoted by the critics are simply wrong.
With a good deal of justification he puts
the real yearly contribution of irriga-
tion to the gross national product as
£5OO million. And this all comes from
a mere total investment of govern-
ment money over 64 years of some
£l2O million less than one year’s
expenditure on defence.
He predicts that in 30 years’ time
the food needs of Australia will have
increased 200 per cent (including ex-
ports) and that as, even at the present
time, a severe drought could be ruinous,
irrigation is the logical answer.
l|/fR Grassby contends that whereas Mr
McFarlane holds that development
of Coleambally will cost £l6O million,
the actual cost will be nearer £5O mil-
lion.
The farmer trying to make a go of
it, not to speak of the average city
man, would be excused for being
much confused by these apparently con-
flicting views.
They are, most of them, both right
and wrong. They are views of the
same subject from different ends. What
they ignore (Mr Grassby, however, does
not) are the human factors.
Had the views of the critics been
stated in, say, 1928 before the bulk of
the irrigation systems were under way,
that would have been the time to recon-
sider irrigation. But now there are
involved, as well as statistics, the lives
of men, women and children.
The same thing applies in other fields
of agriculture notably dairying. But
to implement the ideas of the critics at
this stage would mean uprooting people
and no Australian government would
be likely to seriously contemplate such
a move let alone implement it. At least
let us hope so.
Also the academic critics assume,
wrongly, that there are alternatives to
irrigation areas. For example, if
Coleambally should cost £9O millions
(halfway between Mr Grassby and Mr
McFarlane) this would mean roughly
1000 farms at a total cost (over a de-
veloping period of, say, 25 years) worth
about £90,000 each.
Now this would buy a very nice pro-
perty indeed (although not a fantastic
one) in premium farming areas.
For the amount of money spent on
developing an irrigation area, there
should be more economic sense in buy-
ing twice the number of farms in an
area which does not necessitate irriga-
tion. But try to buy those farms in any
quantity. The present owners of them
simply would not sell or, once the word
got out, would jack up their prices even
higher.
Going back to 1928, it is undeniable
that there were better areas at the time
to irrigate than the Murrumbidgee Irri-
gation Area. (The region between
Corowa and Albury stands out in this
respect.)
But, again, the point is that the only
land available at the price was the near-
desert sheep run encompassing what is
now the MIA.
Irrigation certainly has its drawbacks.
Irrigation-based enterprises tend to need
government subsidy. The land becomes
waterlogged and will not perform as it
should. Water which makes the chosen
area fertile spills out somewhere and
the increased salt content makes that
area infertile.
But improved farming and engineer-
ing techniques can minimise these
things.
Irrigation is only one of a number
of things that this country perhaps
should not have started out on in the
first place . . . but it is a bit late to
start changing our minds at this stage.
It is not that we have all that water
to use or not use (the as yet incomplete
river flow statistics) and at least irriga-
tion is by definition at attempt to put
water to use.
Around 1900 that versatile Australian
author Dr C. E. W. Bean predicted
that by 1960 the sheep raising region of
Australia would have been pushed out
to the near-arid semi-desert “red” coun-
try.
Had the fairly simple “give it a go’’
attitude of the Australian people at that
time prevailed under an unhindered
free-enterprise system, that assuredly is
what would have happened.
But it did not, and it is a fact that
much of our best land is probably being
used wastefully to raise sheep. But
short of a revolution there does not
seem to be much that can be done
about it.
It is, despite the drawbacks, better
to irrigate some land and get some new
people on farms than to stand still and
do nothing.
Certainly the weight of evidence
against irrigation cannot be under-
estimated. A national policy and
approach appears indicated and any
future plans may need more careful
consideration than those in the past.
But to deny those people who have
committed themselves already to a life
of irrigation farming would be a cruel
act.
It is significant that the current storm
in academic circles over irrigation is
confined to NSW and does nqt touch
the big Goulburn Valley irrigation sys-
tem in Victoria. The clear and un-
questioned success of the Goulburn
Valley scheme is in itself a “hands off
notice” to academic critics.
TPhe Goulburn Valley was initially
better situated to irrigation in that
the water source and the markets were
closer, thus reducing the overall costs.
Give it time and Coleambally may
catch up.
Many of the “Sydney side” irrigation
areas today present a fairly bleak and
barren appearance unlikely to impress
academic types used to the comforts
of Sydney and Canberra. But Shep-
parton in Victoria is a growing country
centre likely to impress even the most
severe critic and most of its wealth
stems from irrigation.
It is difficult to believe that in the
last century the Goulburn Valley was “a
land of bush, scrub and summer heat”.
Author W. H. Bossence has recently
written a history of Kyabram, in the
Goulburn Valley, and has pointed out
that in the early years the settlers left
their horses and other livestock on the
banks of the Goulburn because there
was no water at all on their farms. Iron
tanks in those day were precious items
which had to be imported from England
and very few people could afford them.
But then if what could be afford'd
had been the criterion, there would have
been no settlers at all.
Valuing Hops
season, for the first time. Britain’s
hops crop worth £7 million !ast
year is to be valued by the Hops
Marketing Board under artificial light.
The board is using a special lighting
system, a result of three years' trials. In
the past the visual test could be carried
out only under a natural “cold north
light” unobstructed by heavy clouds or
fog. Any variation in the light could
alter the appearance (and value) of a
sample.


The Wonder Bull was a Flop
Value of performance testing
T>anchory Wonder is a Shorthorn bull
not on parade at Royal Sydney
Show. But it is a safe bet that wherever
cattlemen gather throughout the world
this bull will be talked about.
Banchory Wonder was performance-
tested (Bulletin, March 14) in Britain
for live weight gain, food conversion and
conformation. He emerged top bull of
10 finalists.
He should, on his statistics, have
fetched a big price at the Perth (Scot-
land) sales during March. But in a sale
in which the average price was 452
guineas, and one bull brought 8000 gns,
Banchory Wonder sold for a mere 130
guineas!
The British rural journals wrote up
the episode under such headlines as
“Pundits Demoralised The Wonder
Bull a Flop”.
One writer suggested that the breeder
of the unfortunate animal might have a
case if he sued the Government-spon-
sored testing body.
Generally speaking there was much
merriment at the expense of the
academics who in Britain, as in this
country, have been criticising show
standards and promoting the cause of
(costly) performance testing.
Of course, the assembled cattlemen
from USA. the Argentine and other
parts who attended the sale could have
been wrong. They might have passed
up the opportunity of buying the best
bull of the decade.
T>anchory Wonder could yet fulfil his
** destiny—if he gets the chance. But
that is now unlikely. At 130 guineas
(on British prices) he is more likely to
end up as sausages.
However, it would be a pity if the
case of Banchory Wonder spelled finish
to performance testing. One animal
geneticist pointed out that it was a mis-
take to put him in the sales at all.
The processing of data gleaned from
a performance test was simply not de-
signed to determine which bull would
top an auction sale.
Mistakes may have been made also in
the interpretation of the data. Obviously
there was a need for a closer study of
regional requirements and this would
necessitate much wider selection of
animals for performance testing.
This kind of whitewash is unlikely to
impress the diehard critics of the scien-
tific approach to breeding. Neverthe-
less, the contention that it was wrong
to put the bull in a sale does appear
to have merit. Whoever gave the okay
on that was gambling, and that is not
the scientific approach.
There is every indication that per-
formance testing can aid the commercial
breeder; and there is also every indica-
tion that a good many commercial
breeders realise this better than anyone.
They are using it now and have been
for some time. Others have never
countenanced it and that, surely, is their
business.
It is also apparent that one or two
of the more outspoken academics, who
have referred to breeders in the mass in
rather churlish terms, are not doing their
cause, or their hard-working colleagues,
much good.
Going on the recent bash at the
medical profession, emanating from that
ANZAAS Congress in Canberra, could
it be that some of the bright young men
of science believe with P. T. Barnum
that any publicity is good publicity?
One cannot help feeling sorry for the
master of Banchory (whoever he may
be). In providing his bull for testing he
must have hoped that his wretched
animal would gain in market value
through the bestowal of a performance
test rating—a kind of bovine B.Ag.Sc.
no less.
It seems that performance testing has
a long way to go.
Blowflies Have Their Uses
Pollinating agent for onions
TTave you ever known anyone to have
a good word for flies? We spray
them with insecticides, we swat them, we
curse them.
But the ways of nature are both com-
plex and infinite. Those people who have
had a feeling that in exterminating in-
sects, because they make us uncomfort-
able, we may be tampering with the
balance of nature will be heartened by
news of an interesting experiment being
conducted by plant breeders of the Vic-
torian Department of Agriculture.
This experiment is using, among other
things, blowflies as a pollinating agent in
the growing of new and better
varieties of onions.
The new varieties, produced at the
Burnley Plant Research Laboratories
(Melbourne), are superior in yield and
quality to existing varieties while they
retain the excellent handling and preser-
vation qualities of the well-known Vic-
torian brown onions.
Onions are difficult to cross-pollinate
by ordinary methods. The florets on the
heads are smqll and numerous and
mature unevenly. To remove the stamens
to prevent self-pollinating, and then fer-
tilise the floret with pollen from another
plant, would be impossible on a large
scale.
To overcome these difficulties, a special
method developed by American scien-
tists is now being used at Burnley. The
basis of it is the heritable character of
male sterility that is, the inability to
produce pollen inherent in some varieties.
In these varieties the stamens die and,
therefore, do not produce pollen. This
means that the flowers produce seed only
if they are fertilised with pollen produ-
cing a fertile male flower by a suitable
insect.
Normally bees and other numerous
insects carry out the work of pollination.
But this would be too slow and too in-
efficient at Burnley, where numerous
crosses involving many varieties are
wanted.
A male (sterile) and a male (fertile)
variety, showing the characteristics it
is desired to combine, are grown along-
side each other. At flowering the heads of
the two varieties are enclosed in an
insect-proof cage of wire netting.
Blowflies, which are specially bred at
Burnley for this task, are then put in the
cage over the onion flowers. These carry
pollen from the male fertile flower to the
male sterile flower which thus creates
seed for a new hybrid onion.
Many of the hybrids are of little use
and are discarded. Only a few are
worth multiplying and releasing to grow-
ers.
In the United States 70 p.c. of
onions are hybrids. Some of these have
been introduced to Australia, but do not
do well under our climatic conditions.
That is why the locally produced varie-
ties with invaluable help from blow-
flies—are needed.
Being hybrids, of course, seed cannot
be saved for future crops, so each year
more seed will have to be produced. It
will cost more but it is expected that the
extra cost will be more than offset by
higher yields.

Fly to London with reliable KLM— the airline
that has been flying longer than any other
[44 YEARS]
(Read why many experienced Australian travellers prefer to fly KLM)
KLM has been flying since 1920 —longer than any other existing
airline. That’s 44 years of perfecting KLM’s renowned reliability,
efficiency and service. Today, KLM operates the world’s second-
largest international air network. KLM carries an average of 4,000
passengers every day —about twice the capacity of a big ocean
liner. Now read more reasons why it pays to fly to Europe with
reliable KLM.
1. KLM flies you to Europe in a DC-8 jet
believed by many to be the finest
passenger jet aircraft ever built. The
first non-American airline to operate
DC-8 jets, KLM commissioned famous
designer Raymond Loewy to style the
interior so as to speed up service and
increase passenger comfort.
2. KLM flies to 44 cities in Europe, has
77 European offices. English is the
official language in all of them. So,
wherever you go in Europe, a KLM
office is close by with assistance in
language problems. KLM’s Multi-
Stopover Plan lets you make more than
one stop en route to your destination
at no extra air-fare.
3. A KLM jet captain never stops learn-
ing. Before a KLM pilot can become
a DC-8 jet captain he must have 12
years' flying experience. Even then, he
goes back to school seven times a year
for refresher courses.
4. The flight engineer on a KLM DC-8
jet checks 369 points before take-off:
117 in the cockpit, 123 outside the plane
and 69 in the cabin. He even makes
sure the coffee makers are working
perfectly.
5. A KLM DC-8 intercontinental jet
leaves Sydney every Wednesday at
10.15 a.m. Melbourne passengers can
IS
:4rWr
make a same-day connection comfort-
ably. You can breakfast in Rome, lunch
in Amsterdam, dine in London punctu-
ally on Thursday.
6. Ask your Travel Agent to plan your
tour.- With his professional know-how
he can help you make the most of your
time and money. Two of every three
KLM passengers are recommended to
fly KLM by experienced Travel Agents.
