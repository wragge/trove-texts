H. J. Heinz Co. Austro Ha Ltd. recognise the difference in fencing
igßEgg brand security fencing lasts longer
because it’s better made and better erected
Heinz preferred Cyclone’s 67 years of experience
when it came to choosing a security fence to guard
their valuable plant and assets.
Although the security fences Heinz compared
looked alike, they chose Cyclone brand because
they could be sure it was better made and better
erected. These are the reasons why big industry
throughout Australia prefers to specify Cyclone
security fencing above all others. They know they
get top quality materials, a first class erection job,
and will always be able to rely on service.

MASTER-KEYED SYSTEMS
A Master-Keyed System is one in which each
Jock has its own individual key, which oper-
ates that lock only and no other, but where
each lock is also built to a Master-Key which
will open all locks in the group.
Within a Master-Keyed System, if required,
certain locks may be grouped in a section
Keyed-Alike to a given Service-Key, and still
subject to. the Master-Key.

Each group is subject to its own Master-Key,
which opens all locks in that group, but no
other group.
However, all locks are also subject to a
Grand Master-Key which opens all locks in
all groups.
As with Master-Keyed Systems, Keyed-Aiike

WHEN the decimal currency education
campaign was at its fiercest, when a new
Commonwealth loan is floated or a
fresh batch of national trainees are due
for call-up, ABC television becomes
interlarded with advertisements in a way
that the newer television channels must
envy. But, of course, all these advertise-
ments are unpaid and most are for
Government departments, although some
poor but worthwhile bodies, such as the
Road Safety Council, which shares a
chairman Dr Darling with the
ABC, get generous treatment. The
National Trust has enabled Ampol to
get its name across to ABC viewers with
a series that petrol company sponsored.
However, just as some Ministers of
the Crown believe they should be able
to tell the ABC what it should take off
the air, some Government departments
believe they should tell the Commission
what it should put on the air. Most of
the advertisements are, like anything you
get for nothing, not much good. The
ABC says that it agrees to take these
advertisements on certain conditions:
that the advertisements are of “pro-
grammable quality”, that they are pro-
grammed as often, or as rarely, as the
Commission wishes, that acceptance
establishes no precedent and that the
subject is of “public interest”. Which,
unfortunately, isn't the same as saying
that the public will be interested.

AN EGYPTIAN REPORTER in Cairo
n °ted that writer Angus Wilson’s mother
w as South African. “Was she colored or
white? ’ he asked. “White,” said Wilson.
“Ak £ U c l u ' te sure ?” asked the reporter.
Absolutely,” Wilson replied. “Ah! Our
headers will be very disappointed,” said
the Egyptian.
Wilson, brimming with ruddy English
um°r, is spending a week in Sydney
e ore opening the writers’ seminar at
e Adelaide Festival. He came straight
f om eight weeks’ stay on a River Nile
which was complete with
ree Arab servants and an enormous
Nubian captain “very
Conradian indeed,” he
said.
At home, in Bury,
Suffolk, Wilson writes in
his wood-cutter’s cottage
on the edge of a wood.
He said he was writing
more slowly these days
it took only four
weeks to complete his
first novel, “Hemlock
and After”, in 1952.
Later books, such as
“Anglo - Saxon Attitu-
des”, required four
months’ work. “Laugh-
ing Mirrors”, Wilson’s
current novel, is taking
longer because it is
more “experimental” than the others
it opens, he said, with the obituary
notices of the story’s characters.
When Angus Wilson says he wants
to look at gardens in Sydney, it is no
idle touristic interest. Gardening, for
him, comes second only to writing, and
he reviews gardening books for the “Sun-
day Times”. Wilson observed that there
were two types of gardening journalism:
articles giving practical hints and articles
on the aesthetics of gardening.
Wilson said the late Victoria Sackville-
West’s articles for the newspapers were
typical of the aesthetic school and were
written in a very Bloomsbury style. But
Wilson told how she once advised lily-
growers that they could buy bulbs at ss.
each, but if they were poor like she was,
they ought to get all their friends who
went to Turkey to bring bulbs back in a
sponge bag.
Delay
THE LONG-AWAITED and long-delay-
ed “The Art of Australia” by Robert
Hughes is to be further delayed. Although
"Every now and again he darts in and tweaks the
nose—reckons it's worth every cent of ten dollars !"
review copies had been distributed and
at least one review had appeared, Pen-
guin Books have “regretfully announced”
their decision to cancel the entire first
edition. The general manager of the
company, Mr J. H. Stephens, says that
the “extremely disappointing production
standards below the level acceptable to
Penguin Books, Australia, Penguin
Books, England, and to the author” are
to blame. Mr Stephens says the book
will be brought up to date and reprinted
in Britain in about a year’s time.
Tokyo's "One Day"
SYDNEY ACTOR Ben Gabriel, just
back from a Tokyo season of “The One
Day of the Year”, thinks Seymour’s
play was an “inspired choice” for Japan,
not because of its Anzac Day associa-
tions but because it deals with the con-
flict between the generations. “Every
night after the show young Japanese
mostly university students would
come around backstage and talk about
it,” he said. “They identified strongly

Why do so many businessmen fly TAA?
Because TAA is a successful
business enterprise
TAA is a business enterprise required
to make a profit and pay a dividend just
like any other commercial undertaking.
And people naturally prefer to do business
with sound, competent enterprises.
The Airline is operated by the Australian
National Airlines Commission, in the same way
as a public company is controlled by a board of
directors.
I\% DIVIDEND
TAA has a capital of $15,000,000, unchanged
since 1961.
Out of a net profit for 1964/65 of $1,409,052
TAA’s 74% dividend to the Treasury absorbs
$1,125,000.
TAA PAYS TAX
TAA is subject to income tax, payroll tax, sales
tax, etc., normally met by other commercial en-
terprises, and has to pay special tax on aviation
fuel and air route charges as well.
In its operation TAA enjoys no special privi-
leges over its competitors. TAA must win every
passenger and pound of air cargo in open business
competition.
BUSINESS EFFICIENCY
The fact that TAA gains the greater overall
share of the competitive passenger market is in-
dicative of TAA’s business efficiency.
The continued business success of TAA helps
to preserve the competition vital to a healthy
airline industry.
BENEFITS OF COMPETITION
This competition guarantees that every Austra-
lian will continue to enjoy the right to choose by
which airline he will fly, or consign air cargo.
Competition also helps maintain the highest
standards of service for Australian air travellers.
Supporters of free enterprise, in placing busi-
ness with TAA, are preserving for themselves
these benefits of business competition in the air-
line industry.

Out of the 'twenties
AMERICAN newsmagazine “News-

“Australia on the March”, and a spread
©f color pictures. From the pictures of
lifesavers and of Sydney Harbor Bridge
that pre-war engineering marvel
they might have meant Australia on the
march out of the ’twenties and into the
thirties. Australia may be a dull country,
hut surely we don’t still make a religion
°f dullness.

THEY SEEMED as matter-of-fact and
businesslike about it as young executives
putting through a routine deal. This was
Australians Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall
a nd Rod Laver, playing in the Profes-
sional Tennis championships at night at
Sydney’s White City courts, playing an
incredibly efficient power game, never
moving towards a ball unless they are
sure they can return it, each constantly
aceing the other to win their service love-
game. This is the game which Hoad said
he had to turn professional to learn, the
game that Davis Cup manager, Harry
Hopman, who, apparently, had old-
fashioned ideas about trying all the time,
never taught him. It is, too, one might
think, the game which has now led to
crowds of 200 or 300, compared with
5000 or 6000 a couple of years ago, and
the announcer plaintively urging, “Come
again tomorrow, folks, and bring 100 of
your friends.” But it seems hardly likely
that Rosewall and Hoad, who have
satisfactory investments out of their
decade of professional tennis, or even
Laver, who signed up for $lOO,OOO
three years ago, would worry much if
the Sydney gates these days hardly
pay their taxi fare home.

HOCHHUTH’S controversial play, “The
Representative”, opened in Melbourne
last week. The Union Repertory pro-

Play!” That should get in everyone
except the Red Chinese.
young man said with great feeling, T am
Hughie Cook’ and the girl with him
added, ‘I am Hughie Cook but
different’.”
The play was put on at the English-
speaking theatre, a project directed by
American Fred Groton, a former off-
Broadway producer who works for an
immense Japanese entertainment group
which produces films and television and
stage shows. The theatre has the backing
of some American corporations, includ-
ing, Gabriel believed, the Chase Man-
hattan Bank and the National Cash
Register Company. “The One Day” was
the first non-American production.
Gabriel said that Dorothy
collector of Aboriginal art at present in
Tokyo, had passed some Australian plays
to Groton and he had chosen “The One
Day”. Melbourne actors Bunney Brooke
and Sydney Conabere were also in the
cast.
The audiences, Gabriel said, had been
80 per cent Japanese, with about three-
quarters of these students. The theatre,
seating about 600, was filled for most of
the eight performances. Gabriel said he
felt they had got well away from the
sort of “official” audiences which the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra had during
its Tokyo visit. Groton made texts of the
play available to audiences a week before
the performances.
However, Gabriel felt the audiences
had been with them all the way. Delivery
was slightly slowed down but few
changes were made in the text. (He
didn’t want to make invidious compari-
sons with audiences during his Australian
country tours with the play.) “I don’t
think they had much difficulty with the
slang,” he said. “At least not more than
Fred Groton. We were at final rehearsal
and I had been saying ‘You’ll be sweet’
to another character time and time
again before Groton realised this wasn’t
meant to be taken literally.”

THIS AUSTRALIA
THE ALL'ANCE
The Man from Minnesota
By SAM LIPSKI
After Vice-President Humphrey’s long, black limousine had driven off and the
last of the anti-Vietnam demonstrators had dispersed outside the Canberra Hotel
last Saturday, an Australian official summed up, “What an extraordinary speech
what a shame there were no television cameras to cover it. It would have been the
best thing since Lee Kuan Yew broke down”.
The remark was not meant cynically,
for Humphrey’s listeners had been
treated to a remarkable burst of sincerity,
oratory, political know-how, Minnesota
charm and dramatic pleading. Although
he was to have spoken only for a few
minutes, Humphrey ended up speaking
for nearly an hour, leaving a bedazzled
Prime Minister Holt searching for the
right words to express his admiration.
Television cameras, Australian and
American, had been set up to cover the
combined Press conference of Humphrey
and Holt, but there had been none
inside the dining room where the Aus-
tralian Government had arranged a
luncheon in honor of the visiting Vice-
President. Secret Service men guarded
entrances and looked suspiciously at
waitresses as they brought in the turkey.
Speaking without notes for most of
the time and smacking one hand into
the other for emphasis, Humphrey began
with some home-spun pleasantries about
how the night before when his blue and
white Boeing 707 had landed the sunset
reminded him of South-Western Texas,
of how the crisp air in the morning
reminded him of Minnesota, and of how
the placards and demonstrators outside
Parliament House had finally made him
feel really at home.
It seems worthwhile to emphasise
Humphrey’s public appearances, his
speeches and his style. For what mattered
last weekend was the fact of his visit
rather than any major decisions taken.
In the brief contact he had with Aus-
tralian leaders, little of practical value
could be achieved. But the first visit of
an American Vice-President since 1953
(even if the high-powered team was
minus McGeorge Bundy it still had
Averell Harriman and special assistant
Jack Valenti) coming at this time visibly
bolstered the confidence of Holt and his
new Government.
Humphrey also heard the views of Mr
Arthur Calwell publicly and privately.
In public Mr Calwell said that the Aus-
tralian people were divided on the war
in Vietnam. While he did not advocate
unilateral withdrawal of American forces,
he thought that it was an “unwinnable
war”. To which Humphrey replied that
the United States and its allies not only
would win but must win.
Turning on the great flowing warmth
which explained why he is such a for-
midable grass-roots politician in the
United States, Humphrey told his
luncheon listeners how the first man
he had phoned on arrival at the American
Embassy had been Sir Robert Menzies
in Melbourne. They had spoken for an
hour and a half. (That morning
Humphrey had met the whole Australian
Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee
of Cabinet and its advisers for two hours
and 20 minutes.)
were the expected gracious re-
marks about common purpose and
common traditions and that, it seemed,
was going to be all. Not so. Humphrey
began to speak as much to the assembled
foreign diplomats as to his Australian
hosts. All freedom-loving nations should
join in the fight against Communism n
Vietnam. “The free nations must under-
stand that across the underbelly of Asia
there are powerful forces at work that
will destroy them.” His travels had left
him with the strong impression that
nations in South-East Asia must think
increasingly in regional terms, in terms
of economic development for the whole
area as well as in terms of holding back
Communist aggression. Essentially there
was nothing new in his message, but the
fervor and eloquence of its expression
was an admission of how desperately
keen the United States was to be under-
stood, and to communicate its own sense
of itself to other peoples. Thus,
Humphrey pleaded, Americans did not
want to be known as “a nation of
warriors”, but as a nation of healers, of
educators and builders. They wanted to
bring “good works” to the world, to
free it from disease, poverty and hunger.
“We are the revolutionaries. We are the
liberators. We are the agents of justice
and reform,” he declaimed.
But the threat of Communism had to
be met. Aggression unchecked was
aggression unleashed. Not only did
Humphrey take over the mantle of social
revolution in the name of the United
States but, he also proclaimed, “history
is on our side”, and however badly or
pessimistically the war seemed to be
going in Vietnam, he felt “restrained
optimism” about it.
Vietnam was the pilot-project of inter-
national Communist doctrine, the “test-
tube” for the theories about wars of
“national liberation”. His views on
this give some idea of the vice-presi-
dential style (and incidentally reflect the
impact of the Kennedy-Sorenson speech-
making school as well).
“The wars of ‘national liberation’ they
call them—from Peking. What a play
on words. How the Communists have
destroyed the meaning of words.
“They speak of liberation when they
mean oppression. They speak of a
‘people’s republic’ when they have no
regard for the people and no definition
or understanding of the word republic.
They speak of the ‘people’s democracies’
and there is not a single democratic
thought or institution that’s been de-
veloped. The Communists have polluted
and adulterated the meaning of words
that decent humanity has known for
centuries.
“I think it is about time that we under-
stood that fact. They not only fight us
with weapons, they not only use every
conceivable device that is known for
the purpose of human destruction, they
destroy the meaning of language. They
destroy the meaning of the precious
word. Words like ‘freedom’, words like
‘democracy’, words like ‘liberty’, words
like ‘justice’. These are words of the
spirit. These are precious words.
“The Communist not only destroys
the village and the hamlet in South
Vietnam —he not only attacks estab-
lished government and tries to discredit
it in nation after nation, he destroys the
very meaning of life as one interprets
it in the written word and the spoken
word.”
Quite clearly the man speaking inside
the Canberra Hotel could not feel that
the demonstrators outside really under-
stood what the United States was about.
For their part the demonstrators little
old ladies with crude swastikas on
placards, Left-wnig and Communist-
dominated union groups with “Humphrey
Warmonger” as their chant, students
carrying Campaign for Nuclear Dis-
armament flags and posters bearing the
words “Bomb Washington” were more
than pleased.
Earlier, as Humphrey left Parliament
House, the peace-front groups and the
Communist Party had scored an im-
portant propaganda coup. Nearly every
one of the 32 American newsmen travel-
ling with the Vice-President filed stories
on the demonstration, and television
cameramen from a number of major
American networks had at last found
some action on the trip, as the demon-


strators surged forward. Nowhere else on
the Vice-President’s tour of Asian capi-
tals had there been any demonstrations
against him, explained the newsmen. The
American Secret Service men, übiquitous
and efficient, were quick to ensure that
the demonstration passed without major
incident, although the demonstrators were
after publicity not Vice-President Hum-
phrey.
At the combined Press conference
which followed the luncheon, some
pointed questions to both leaders brought
some useful answers. Prime Minister
Holt revealed that the Australian Gov-
ernment was actively considering send-
ing more forces to Vietnam although
Humphrey had not asked for them during
his meeting with Australian ministers;
ways and means to improve the lines
of communication between Washington
and Canberra were discussed; Humphrey
was convinced that the military war
could be won although he would not
commit himself to a time limit the
job of ensuring economic and social
progress as well as a stable Saigon gov-
ernment were far harder tests of Allied
purpose; Humphrey re-affirmed Ameri-
can willingness to accept the Vietcong
as part of the North Vietnamese delega-
tion at any peace talks even if not as
a separate entity.
Although Humphrey was quite pre-
pared to answer more questions, the
combined Press conference came to an
abrupt end when three Secret Service
men, at an agreed signal, leapt to their
feet and shouted in unison, “Thank you,
Mr Vice-President”, turned on their heels
and made it quite clear that the con-
ference was over.
As Humphrey prepared to leave for
New Zealand the next day, he told re-
porters at Fairbairn airport that Holt
had asked him to pass on a request to
President Johnson for a conference of
the Allies either at summit or other
level. However much he might protest
otherwise in public, there seems little
doubt that Mr Holt is anxious for closer
co-ordination of political and diplomatic
activities on Vietnam. Vice-President
Humphrey’s visit should help in- this
direction. At the very least, Mr Holt
must be hopeful that in Vice-President
Humphrey he will have someone who
will speak more soothingly in public
about Australia’s Vietnam commitment
than last year’s visitor, Senator Fulbright.

President Humphrey is on page 20.]
THE LABOR PARTY I
Power for the Rump
By ALAN REID
Both the leadership and State Aid are, oddly, only side issues in the present
Labor struggle. The real issues are ALP-machine control of the Federal Parliamentary
Labor Party, and Foreign Affairs.
In the Party sense, ALP machine
control of the Federal Labor Party is the
most important issue since the ALP
Federal Executive at its recent Canberra
meeting asserted complete authority over
Labor's Parliamentary wing and can
now control Labor’s Foreign Affairs
policy through its directives. But foreign
policy is also important in itself. For the
group that controls the ALP Federal Ex-
ecutive is anti-United States. The group's
policy directives to Labor parliamentar-
ians could well effect the United States-
Australian alliance. The US administra-
tion has to think some years ahead and in
its long-range defence planning in this
area of the world, consider the possibi-
lity that the Parliamentary mouthpieces
of the group controlling the ALP Federal
Executive could become the government
of Australia.
To understand what is happening in
the Labor Party, it is necessary to realise
that there are two Left-wing groupings.
Jfoth groups have the same long-term ob-
jectives ALP-machine control of the
Federal Parliamentary wing and com-
plete control of Labor’s foreign policy
and both groups work closely together.
Both groups appreciate where the real
power in modern Australia lies. They
are completely indifferent to whether
there are or are not State Labor govern-
ments. Realistically, they concentrate
upon the real seat of power—the Com-
monwealth Government. While they work
together, their tactics, but never their
objectives, sometimes diverge.
Group one led by F. E. (“Joe”) Cham-
berlain, the WA ALP Secretary is anti-
US, backs, is backed by, the Left-wing
Victorian ALP Executive. This group
wants machine control of parliamentar-
ians, control of Labor’s foreign policy,
and no State Aid.
Group two which backs Dr J. Cairns
and also draws its strength from the
Communist-influenced Victorian ALP
Executive, wants machine control of par-
liamentarians (it is easier to control a
machine than a Federal Parliamentary
Party that is susceptible to electoral pres-
sures), control of Labor’s foreign policy,
and power. It is almost indifferent to
State Aid. If the giving of State Aid
would give it power it would give State
Aid. But it cannot be completely indif-
ferent to State Aid because of Mr Cham-
berlain’s implacable opposition to its
existence.
It is not without significance that Dr
Cairns was the architect of the offer
to pay one dollar a week for all school-
children which Mr Calwell dangled
(seemingly unsuccessfully) as electoral
bait and as a substitute for State Aid
after the ALP Executive meeting.
Whether or not Dr Cairns approached
Mr Whitlam for the “shadow” External
Affairs portfolio (Mr Whitlam told the
Sydney meeting of the Federal Labor
Parliamentarians that this had been done
in December last but Dr Cairns the next
day denied it had ever been done either
by himself or, as far as he knew, by any-
one on his behalf), a Whitlam-Cairns
alignment would be by no means un-
natural in view of the lack of intensity
on the part of the group supporting
Cairns on the question of State Aid.
As Whitlam’s original letter to the
Federal ALP Executive showed (after the
Executive had made their anti-State Aid
decisions) he was concerned only with the
effect on the electorate of the decisions.
He missed the real issue—the fact that
the ALP Executive was establishing a
stranglehold over the parliamentary
wing which, once established, would be
almost impossible to break and which
would provide the ALP Executive not
only with control over the parliamen-
tarians but over what the Left wing was
principally interested in foreign
affairs. It was not until Mr Allan Fraser
pointed up the real issue the funda-
mental struggle that existed between the
ALP machine and the parliamentary
wing that Whitlam started to grasp
the significance of what was happening.
By then the side issues of leadership
and State Aid had become inextricably
mixed up with the major crisis in ALP
machine-Labor Parliamentarian relation-
ships, and Whitlam had further clouded
the real issue by revealing his leadership
ambitions nakedly. Yet before all this
developed, those supporting Cairns could
have quite easily allied themselves with
Whitlam to find a compromise solution
to the State Aid issue on which only the
machine politicians like Chamberlain
had a fixation. Provided that Whitlam
did not stand in the way of establishing
machine control over the parliamen-
tarians and the Left wing’s domination
of Labor’s foreign policies, they could
have gone along with him to get the real
prizes while he enjoyed the prestige.
But once the situation developed to a
point where Whitlam’s activities threat-
ened machine control of Labor’s parlia-
mentary wing, the parliamentary group

supporting Cairns were as one with their
machine allies. Whitlam was no longer
of any use to them. In fact, he could
become a danger to their long-term aims.
Whitlam was written off. Cairns came
out with a declaration of support for
Calwell, and the Left wing mustered
behind Calwell to keep him as leader
until the remoulded Labor Caucus,
almost certain to be under clearcut Left
wing rule, reassembled after the next
elections.
On the State Aid issue, Labor could
lose up to fourteen seats at the next elec-
tions and this is what, in addition to
clamping ALP machine control more
tightly over the parliamentarians, the
anti-State Aid Federal Executive decisions
were designed to do. Of the fourteen seats
lost, two will (on the Left wing’s estima-
tion) belong to the group that normally
supports Cairns in the Caucus. But there
have to be casualties even in the most
successful battle. And the Left-wing
estimate that the remaining twelve will
belong to anti-Cairns, anti-Victorian Ex-
ecutive group.
With the Federal Parliamentary Labor
Party already under machine control,
the Left wing will also have control in its
own right of Federal Parliamentary
Labor Party from the Left wing’s
viewpoint the most dangerous power
point in which the opponents of the
Victorian ALP Executive still have a
majority. Actually there seems to be no
good reason why the Left wing fear the
anti-Victorian ALP Executive majority
in the Caucus. It is a fragmented, con-
fused majority. But by establishing a
Left wing majority in the Caucus, the
Left wing makes its grip doubly secure.
After that the Federal ALP Executive
can march into NSW, at present a Right-
wing ALP branch, take it over and dis-
pose of any remaining opponents through
preselection ballots.
This is hard, tough thinking which
looks years ahead. If the Left can pull
it off they finish in complete control of
the Labor Party. Even if their thesis
(which shows an almost Communist con-
tempt for the intelligence of ordinary
voters) that sooner or later the present
non-Labor Government will collapse
through external or internal causes and
they will then be the only available alter-
native government is wrong, the rump
to which Federal Parliamentary Labor
Party will be reduced will be, in the
words of Mr Allan Fraser, “A tight or-
ganised group that would advocate mass
industrial action even violence
against a conservative government”.
And as Fraser accurately points out,
this would wreck parliamentary govern-
ment of the type Labor has always believ-
ed in. The next few weeks are going to
be as interesting as any in Labor’s tur-
bulent history.
THE LABOR PARTY II
In Cairns’ Yarra
As Alan Reid’s report makes clear, the future of Dr Cairns in the long run is
as impor ant to the future of the ALP as that of Mr Whitlam. But there is a challenge
to Dr Cairns, coming not from within the ALP but at the polls, which may upset
many calcula ions. From Melbourne, Dr Cairns’ home territory, Brian Buckley
reports:
In 1963 it was Haylen; in 1966 it
could be Cairns. The possibility of a
Left-wing Caucus takeover after the
almost certain heavy Labor losses at the
next election has already been widely
discussed with the name of Dr Cairns
featuring most prominently as the future
ALP leader in such circumstances.
The one significant item so far omit-
ted from these speculations is the chance
that there could be a new name along-
side the Federal electoral district of
Yarra in Hansard, 1967.
Labor has always held Yarra with an
absolute majority but the vulnerability
of its position was revealed in 1961
when, despite a nationwide swing
against the Government, the Cairns vote
fell to an absolute majority of 1300. In
1963 the vote improved to a majority
of 3800 but this was probably caused
by a combination of three factors: illness
and consequent lack of vigor in the
campaign of the DLP candidate, Stan
Keon; a rather desultory Liberal cam-
paign which altogether lacked the enter-
prise and industry of that led by pre-
sent State Liberal President, Andrew
Peacock, in 1961 and the confusing pre-
sence of a couple of Independents with
some local following.
If Keon can recover the 800 votes he
dropped in 1963, and some more, and
the Liberals can win a corresponding in-
crease, Cairns will be in a lot of trouble.
In short, if he loses half of his present
absolute majority, he loses his seat. In
his favor is his personal popularity which
is continually maintained by the spend-
ing of generous amounts of time and
energy on the problems of local electors.
This personal appeal is backed by a
highly efficient local political machine,
one of the most industrious and well-
disciplined in Australia.
But a number of factors are running
against him this time:
• The Liberal Party has chosen an


able and ambitious young candidate in
Leo Hawkins. A Commerce graduate
like Cairns, Hawkins has an advantage
in that he has spent some time in Asia,
including a two-year period with the
Ghurkas in Malaya. Hawkins will get a
lot of practical support from the Young
Liberals and will concentrate on personal
contact work;
• Migration has increased the Ca-
tholic population of Yarra to around 30
per cent, and athough recent Catholic
migrants are not so sensitive to the State
Aid issue as their Irish predecessors,
Cairns’ opposition to State Aid will count
against him;
• Whilst the population of working-
class Richmond is static the population
of Hawthorn, the other large area of
Yarra, is increasing. Most of Hawthorn’s
new citizens live in new cream and pink
brick flats for about 18 dollars to 30
dollars a week. They will increase the
Liberal figures;
• The likely DLP candidate, Stan
Keon, is fit and active again. He has
a strong local following which recent
Labor events will not diminish;
• There is a lot of work to be done
on the Richmond and Hawthorn rolls.
(Voting day is known to the local wags
at Richmond as the “day of the triennial
resurrection of the dead.”) In Hawthorn
it is thought that hundreds and, perhaps,
thousands of recent arrivals have not en-
rolled or changed their enrolment.
Whilst Cairns will rely heavily on his
personal appeal and his efficient local
ALP corps, Hawkins will concentrate on
national issues, defence, and foreign
policy: areas which may influence mig-
rants and the flat-dwelling middle-class.
The DLP which has enjoyed a great
boost in morale over the Labor State Aid
split has its issues presented ready-made.
Some of the local Liberals believe that if
they can even bring the rolls up to date
they can take between one and two
thousand votes from Cairns’ majority.
Rumors that Cairns is anxious to
transfer to the electorate of Melbourne
when Arthur Calwell retires probably
have their base in his recognition of this
possibility. But has he delayed his move
too long?

THE LABOR PARTY III
Real Issues
The opponents of the ALP Federal
Executive should band themselves to-
gether into their own Parliamentary
Party and call for the support of every
anti-Communist element in the Labor
movement. That was the only real policy
for victory.
This was the unequivocal advice given
by Mr B. A. Santamaria, President of the
National Civic Council, in his weekend
telecast. Was he saying in effect that now
was the time for the DLP and the anti-
communists in the ALP to start talking
in time for the next Federal elections?
Whatever the speculation his telecast
may raise, Mr Santamaria was definite
about what the “real issues” were in the
current struggle for power.
Fie said that the Federal Executive’s
recent decisions on State Aid, although
motivated by sectarian malice, were the
least important of all. Of far greater
importance were the three pro-Com-
munist, anti-American resolutions
attacking South Korea for sending
troops to Vietnam, calling for an investi-
gation into the hypothetical activities of
the CIA and “whitewashing” unity
tickets which made it clear that if
the Labor Party had not been kept out
of office for the last 10 years, American
Vice-President Humphrey would not be
visiting Australia, our links with America
would long since have been weakened,
perhaps broken.
Alongside the question of Australia’s
security, the party’s attitude on indepen-
dent schools was secondary. At some
point Mr Whitlam, Mr Fraser or some-
body else had to get beyond State Aid
and the technicalities of Labor’s consti-
tution and say openly: “I will not rest
until Communists and collaborators with
Communism are put outside the ALP.”
Mr Santamaria said that someone
could win the leadership of the ALP
without saying it. But he could not be-
come Prime Minister of Australia with-
out saying and doing it.
IMMIGRATION
The Locsin
Challenge
The Loesin ease has presented Mr
Harold Holt with a potentially explosive
diplomatic and political challenge. It is*
of course, also a magnificent opportunity
to do something about the nagging and
inescapable facts of an immigration
policy geared to racial exclusion.

from Oscar Villadolid in Manila shows
the intensity of feeling in the Philippines
on the Locsin Case. He writes:
Filipinos, in and out of Government,
are itching for a showdown with Aus-
tralia, its “down-under” neighbor, for her
“White Australia” policy. They are still
roaring mad over the refusal by the Can-
berra Government to allow entry of
Aurelio Locsin, a 35-year-old Filipino
banker from a prominent southern
family, after leading him on to hope for
more than seven months that he and his
family were acceptable candidates for
entry as immigrants.
Now, Locsin a six-footer, fair com-
plexioned man weighing 200 pounds
has no longer anything good or sensible
to say about Australia. Locsin, as the
name sounds, is of Chinese ancestry,
with obviously a liberal sprinkling of
Spanish blood. “I don’t care a whit about
racial discrimination if Australians keep
to themselves instead of passing them-
selves off as Asians,” he said recently.
Locsin, whose two brothers are Filipino
journalists and whose uncle was Manila’s
late fiery and progressive mayor, Arsenio
Lacson, said that, while no longer interes-
ted to go to Australia (“Why should
Asians be discriminated against in
Asia?”), he would file a formal protest of
discrimination against the Australian Gov-
ernment with the Philippines’ Depart-
ment of Foreign Affairs “for the
sake of others who’d be discriminated
against”. Secretary of Foreign Affairs,
Narciso Ramos, is eagerly awaiting the
Locsin protest. “I would take action,”
he said, “if necessary to protect the
national dignity.” The view from Padre
Faura (Philippines’ counterpart of White-
hall) is that the Aussies are practising
apartheid and must be denounced under
the United Nations convention against
racial discrimination.
Afficial eagerness to pick up the case
stems not only from the well-known
Gamboa case of more than 15 years ago
which still rankles every full-blooded
Filipino. There is also the nagging suspi-
cion that Australia supported Japan, a
former enemy country, all the way in
the crucial balloting last year (the Philip-
pines won by only one vote) for the site
of the Asian Development Bank, despite
careful hints from Australian Embassy
officials here that Canberra, the Philip-
pines’ partner in the South-East Asia
Treaty Organisation and in the Colombo
Plan, preferred the “enemy” because of
trade considerations (“They can’t sell us
the wool, that’s what,” said one disgusted
official).
Furthermore, the feeling here among
officials is that Australia identifies herself
with Asia only when it suits her. Actual-

H ic
ly, there’s no serious support here behind
Australia’s claim that “she belongs to
Asia”. “Asians are good enough to buy
Australian goods, but not good enough to
live side by side with Australians,”
decried “Manila Times” columnist
Maximo Soliven. He added: “If Aus-
tralians expect Asians to accept this as a
fact of life, they must be supreme opti-
mists. We may be poor, but we’re not
stupid.”
“Manila Daily Bulletin” columnist Rex
D. Drilon views the problem in a slightly
different light. His approach is a tit-for-
tat affair. “Let’s bar the Australians, ex-
cept the brown natives who are perish-
ing in that big island, from coming in as
tourists,” he said, “conceding that Aus-
tralia has the right to like or dislike a
person on the basis of the color of his
skin.”
But Drilon had some acid comments.
Said he: “Every time we see a white Aus-
tralian in the Philippines, we should look
him in the eye, not to spit on him, but
to exclaim: ‘So you are from that country
built up by the white prison convicts
and which now tells the Filipinos never,
never to contaminate its lily-white purity!’
Then he would answer: ‘Why do you
inferior people insist on contaminating
others?’ To which we would counter-
ansv.er ‘Your days in Asia are numbered.
Woe unto you when the deluge comes!’ ”
What has this reaction meant in Can-
berra? John Webb points out that the
Locsin case has emphasised once again
the way in which our immigration poli-
cies, and in particular their ham-fisted ad-
ministration, clash with the professed
aims of other arms of government. From
Canberra he reports:
Locsin case creates a neat division
of opinion between Commonwealth
departments on the use of discretionary
power. Since the Immigration Depart-
ment decided against the application last
August it has not heard from Locsin,
directly or indirectly, and has not been
approached on his behalf.
The Department rejected the applica-
tion on policy grounds ruling that the
five categories which permit an Asian to
enter Australia for an indefinite stay did
not apply to Locsin. (The categories are
designed to cover persons with outstand-
ing cultural attainments, professional or
technical skills, certain businessmen, and
a few others.) The discretionary power
held by the Minister for Immigration,
Mr H. Opperman, and delegated to his
officers, may be exercised to admit a
person who cannot meet one of the
five policy categories.
But Immigration argues that a person’s
influential connections should not entitle
him to exceptional treatment. It is on
record as saying that Government policy,
not departmental discretion or lack of
it, is responsible for the decision not to
admit Locsin.
Certainly, the application of policy
provisions has been consistent. The Ex-
ternal Affairs officer in Manila, respon-
sible for processing the many applications
for admission to Australia received each
year, is able to reject most on the spot.
The remainder he refers to Canberra,
Locsin is not the only “important” or
“influential” Asian refused entry.
The essential difference is that Loc-
sin (not being concerned whether he was
beaten on policy grounds or discretion)
has howled, his case has become celebrat-
ed and the damage to Australia’s image
is severe. This is where the division of
opinion on use of discretionary power
comes in. The Departments of Trade and
External Affairs have never complained
publicly about the damage caused by the
Locsin case. But they have been battling
for adoption of what they regard as a
more realistic approach to applications
which, if rejected, can hurt Australia,
politically and economically. The argu-
ment, in cold, hard terms, is: why
strike a moral pose and refuse to apply
discretionary power to the detriment of
Australia?
The Government, of course, is the
responsible authority. But the argument
that the Immigration Department should
administer the law with some practical
flexibility to avoid what may be needless
harm to Australia’s image and work over-
seas, carries a lot of weight. Against this,
one feels inclined to applaud a Govern-
ment agency which says: “We do not
want to apply one law to the rich and

Humphrey—
the Favorite Son
In LBJ's metabolism league
From GEORGE McGANN in New York
Hubert Horatio Humphrey stood in a paddock at the Tansonnhnt agricultural
experiment stations, near Saigon, the other day and tried the hog-calling technique
be had learned as a boy in Minnesota.
“Hoo-ee, hoo-ee” trumpeted the Vice-
President of the United States at a group
of hogs lying in the South Vietnamese
sun. The sleeping beasts paid no atten-
tion to the vice-presidential summons.
Later the ebullient American emissary
was photographed giving the three-finger
boy scout salute to a group of uniformed
Vietnamese kids. “I’m an honorary life
member of the boy scouts,” the Vice-
President told them, adding: “This is the
most fun I’ve had in months it is a
riot.”
Next day the Vice-President gave his
host, Premier Nguyen Cao Ky, what an
aide described as “high-priced instruc-
tion” in the old American art of politick-
ing. With shirt-sleeves rolled up, Hum-
phrey hopped out of his helicopter at
outlying villages, ran along a line of
welcoming children patting heads, made
a speech, shook hands and, teeth gleam-
ing in a farewell “so long”, hopped back
into the chopper. By the end of the day
he had Marshal Ky doing it too, to the
astonishment of Vietnamese peasants
who had never before seen their head of
state in his shirtsleeves.
At Thailand, next point of call for
America’s diplomat a go-go on his hit-
and-run, instant goodwill tour of the
Far East, Humphrey leaped out of his
helicopter in a dry rice paddy at Non-
ghkai, directly across the Mekong River
from Laos. After a quick glance around
him, the ever-smiling Vice-President told
200 peasants and soldiers gathered in
welcome: “You have some fine country
here - it looks like Minnesota.”
The dramatic up-grading of Vice-
President Humphrey’s role in the John-
son administration, of which this present
Asian tour is an example, has been ex-
plained in various ways. One of the more
obvious reasons is that the President is
a well-known reader of, and believer in,
public opinion polls. He has said that he
considers Humphrey “the best man in
America for the job” of President. Presi-
dent Johnson’s antipathy towards the
presidential ambitions of Senator Robert
Kennedy is no secret. If the President
wants to beat Kennedy with Humphrey,
this line of reasoning goes, he can do
nothing else but give the Vice-President
more scope and more exposure to the
public at home and abroad.
Presidential office has been the over-
riding ambition of Hubert Humphrey,
now 56, since he was Minnesota’s
“favorite son” candidate in the presi-
dential primaries of 1952. Eight years
later he took on John F. Kennedy in the
same presidential primary and suffered
a disastrous loss. But the ambition was
still there and Humphrey withdrew from
the presidential race to run successfully
for re-election to the Senate. Humphrey,
a product of the depression years, had to
work to put himself through the Univer-
sity of Minnesota, where he was a bril-
liant student in political science.
After a brief teaching career, Hum-
phrey went into politics as a staunch
Roosevelt New Dealer. His first try for
office was a failure, as he lost the close
election of 1943 for Mayor of Minne-
apolis. Characteristically, he was spurred
on by the defeat, and two years later
became Mayor with the help of the Left-
ist Farmer Labor Party, whose votes he
had assiduously wooed. The Farmer
Laborites played a large role in Hum-
phrey’s subsequent elections to the
Senate in 1948, 1954 and 1960 and con-
tributed to the “pinko” label which
Republican opponents have always tried
to pin on him.
The Vice-President and the President
have much in common besides a rever-
ence for the philosophy of the late
Franklin Roosevelt. “Humphrey is sus-
tained in the vice-presidency, as he has
been during a busy lifetime, by a modi-
fied Calvinist view that he owes the
world a living,” one biographer wrote.
“As if this were not good enough to
cause him daily to stretch the outer
limits of man’s capacity for work, he has
the additional spur of Johnson’s own in-
fernal energy. It has been said that the
two men control a good share of Wash-
ington’s entire adrenalin flow; in fact,
Humphrey is probably the only man in
Washington who belongs in the same
metabolism league with Johnson.”
And everywhere he went, the Vice-
President hammered home the twin mes-
sage he carried with him as Lyndon
Johnson’s personal ambassador: “There
are two wars in South Vietnam the
military struggle against the Vietcong
and the social revolution. Both of these
wars are being won by us.”
This combination of mid-western com
and Madison Avenue hard-sell techniques
might or might not be having the desired
effect on the Asiatic multitudes. But it
was causing a great deal of uneasiness
among Americans back home who felt
that the cheerful Vice-President was
overdoing the folksiness and the glad-
hand approach and painting a far more
glowing picture of the reality of the
South Vietnam situation than was visible
at this distance.
“Thus far the voyage is proving an
application of words, words, words and

a great outpouring of cheer upon a grave
and tragic situation,” the “New York
Times” commented. “But Madison
Avenue public relations and the methods
of American politics, understood at home
but not always abroad, are not going
to do the trick.” The trick referred to,
of course, was the conjuring up of peace
in Vietnam and the consequent bestowal
of vast economic benefits upon that un-
happy land.
If Americans at home were having
their doubts about the efficacy of the
vice-presidential odyssey, the Americans
on the spot in Saigon were apparently
even more critical of his bouncy pro-
nouncements. Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge said he was happy to see fresh
faces among the Washington reporters
accompanying the vice-presidential party.
The Washington Pressmen, the ambassa-
dor confided to an official, were not
“jaded and cynical” about the Viet-
namese struggle. Presumably the resident
Americans were. One such cynic noted
that Humphrey’s fervent missionary
approach to the war fell flat in the
face of “the palpable background of
Vietcong power, Saigon’s lack of popular
support in the countryside and the
immense task of reforming Vietnamese
society”.
An unidentified spokesman with the
Humphrey tour gave reporters in Bang-
kok this version of the underlying pur-
pose of the fast-paced vice-presidential
swing around the Pacific:
The Vice-President was actually carry-
ing out three distinct operations, accord-
ing to this inside source. The first,
“Operation Commitment”, constituted a
firm restatement of America’s determina-
tion to help defend South-East Asia from
the Communist threat—and provide “all
necessary assistance” to the countries
being threatened. The second was
“Operation Momentum”, an attempt to
use the “Declaration of Honolulu” as
a means of impressing the South-East
Asian governments with the necessity of
moving ahead with social, political and
economic reform as part of the struggle
against Communist subversion. The
third, “Operation Recovery”, was aimed
at reassuring those Asians who might
have feared that the recent pause in the
bombing of North Vietnam or the Presi-
dent’s peace offensive indicated that the
US might give up the struggle or
recognise the National Liberation Front
as the effective power in South Vietnam.
This tidy little package of American
aims in South-East Asia made easy read-
ing, but seemed slightly out of focus
when looked at in thj light of what was
happening back home. People watch-
ing the televised Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee hearings under the
chairmanship of Senator Fulbright in
recent weeks were certainly not getting
the impression that any such clear-cut
attitude toward South-East Asia pre-
vailed in Washington.
Senator- Fulbright summoned the com-
mittee into session at the same time as
the President’s highly publicised (and
hastily organised) visit to Honolulu. That
visit and the consequent Declaration of
Honolulu overshadowed the Fulbright
hearings at the time. However, the testi-
mony of such eminent individuals as
retired Lieut-General James Gavin and
former State Department planning chief
George Kennan, a noted expert on Com-
munist relations, has absorbed the atten-
tion —and enlisted the sympathies—of a
large segment of the population. Neither
“hawks” nor “doves”, Gavin and Kennan
have espoused a third course, involving
withdrawal of American forces in South
Vietnam to protected “enclaves” which
would provide a permanent American
“presence” in South Vietnam without
the danger of ultimate confrontation with
Red China.
Many Americans formerly committed
to the Administration’s line in Vietnam
have been frankly puzzled by presiden-
tial behavior before and since the
Honolulu meeting. As political columnist
James Reston put it, “The President
seemed to be thrashing about, rejecting
peace offensives and then trying them,
stopping bombing and then starting
bombing, rejecting the UN and then
appealing to the UN.” On its face,
however, the Declaration of Honolulu
appeared to offer some prospect of
eventual solution to the conflict in Viet-
nam. At least it was not as hawklike as
the Goldwaters and Lemays would have
wanted it to be. Instead of a commit-
ment of as many as a million men, it
indicated that only another 100,000
would be added to the 200,000 already
there, in the opinion o f informed Wash-
ington military people. It did not en-
compass increased bombing of North
Vietnam, and certainly not of Hanoi or
other- population centres.
The general interpretation of the docu-
ment was that the war would remain a
limited one, that new social and economic
reforms would be implemented when-
ever possible in South Vietnam and that
peace efforts would go on, in the UN, in
neutral capitals, and wherever the Ad-
ministration could find anyone to talk
peace with. Perhaps the most immediate
meaningful decision taken at Honolulu
was for a renewed “pacification” pro-
gramme in the countryside of Vietnam.
This strategy is similar to that tried,
without success, during the Diem regime.
There is no apparent reason for expect-
ing that it will work now. In any case,
pacification is to be attempted on a very
modest scale at the beginning.

How can a jet do a vertical take-off
without moving an inch ?
A new wind tunnel has been designed and built by Hawker Siddeley Aviation
at Hatfield specifically for V/STOL research. The first in Europe, it has a
working section of 15' x 15'. The tunnel floor can be raised and lowered inde-
pendently of the model, and air-speed through the tunnel varied to simulate
different aspects of vertical and short take-off and landing.
Hawker Siddelev know how.
The jet aircraft is an accurate scale model. The vertical
take-off is simulated in Europe’s first V/STOL wind
tunnel, designed by Hawker Siddeley Aviation. Instead
of the model moving, the tunnel floor moves. And
research into V/STOL development progresses.
Hawker Siddeley have the world’s first operational
V/STOL jet to their name—the P. 1127. But the
Hawker Siddeley name means far more than this. It
represents a complex of companies that make Hawker
Siddeley a world-size industrial group.
You find Hawker Siddeley products almost every-
where. They go down on the farm—haul trains —steer
and power ships—probe space—equip power stations—
roll roads—store heat—fly people—transform electricity
—pack food—fuel aircraft. And maintain a daily
turnover of $A2| million. Aircraft of the future are
already part of this turnover. But only part. That’s what
makes Hawker Siddeley a group. With group power.

Water Board Follies
Vicious restrictions on home gardeners
By KEITH O. CAMPBELL
(Professor of Agricultural Economics, University of Sydney)
As a direct result of the drought
which has afflicted large sections
of the Australian mainland in the
past 12 months, many towns and cities
are currently being subjected to water
restrictions arbitrarily imposed by muni-
cipal or water-supply authorities. In par-
ticular, those two and a half million
Australians who are unfortunate enough
to be customers of the Sydney Water
Board have since August last been pro-
hibited from hosing their gardens, save
between the hours of 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
and then only with hand sprinklers.
This pattern of restrictions, picking
out the home gardener for special atten-
tion, is characteristic of the rationing
procedures adopted by most water-
supply authorities, when, because of the
vagaries of weather or more likely their
own shortcomings, they have insufficient
water to meet their customers’ demands
at the going price of water.
The question arises why water-supply
authorities traditionally restrict, often
viciously, the rights of citizens to use
water for gardening, but allow the
profligate user of water for other pur-
poses to go unchecked.
Various answers can be given to the
question. It might be claimed that the
use of water for gardens can be more
easily policed than other uses. More
pertinently, water-supply authorities are
unwilling and, in many cases in the short
run at least, unable to meter all water
used, and thus cannot use water pricing
as a means of encouraging a more saving
attitude to water usage on the part of
all consumers.
Perhaps the basic reason is that water
engineers, the world over, believe that
the use of water on gardens represents
an unessential use of water. An interest-
ing insight into engineers’ attitudes to
this question is provided by a paper
delivered by Mr J. R. Dridan, of the
Engineering and Water Supply Depart-
ment of the City of Adelaide, to the 1963
symposium on Water Resources, Use and
Management arranged by the Australian
Academy of Science. In this paper on
“The Urban Uses of Water”, Mr Dridan
lists his priorities. To the question “What
purpose has the greatest claim on water
resources?” he replies:
“Human consumption and the pro-
duction of food for human consumption
must rank high in priority . . . Large
quantities of water must be used for
the production of chemicals, metals,
machines and implements of many kinds.
Therefore industrial use must now rank
high on the priority list.
“Commerce, transport and other ser-
vices are also essential and involve the
use of large quantities of water. The
herding together of many people in large
towns and cities . . . calls for a far higher
standard of personal and community
sanitation than was necessary when most
of the world’s population lived in small
communities with a low population
density and a large percentage of all
water supplied in urban areas now finds
its way into the drainage system. This
is another purpose which must be
accorded a high priority.
“All of the purposes mentioned are
essential to the life and health of the
community and this leaves a very short
list on the lower end of the priority
scale. This list includes wafer used for
aesthetic purposes, e.g., ornamental
plants, fountains, air-conditioning, etc.”
This statement of the consumption
habits of urban dwellers and their im-
plications for water rationing is in-
adequate and unsatisfactory in many
ways. For one thing it reflects that
extremely common, but basically absurd
notion that water, because of its phsysio-
logical role in the sustenance of humans,
plants and animals, should not be subject
to the ordinary criteria governing the use
of resources in general. Like the ancient
Egyptians, people of this persuasion
ascribe certain mystical, if not sacred,
qualities to water.
If the citizens of Sydney or any other
city, following their best aesthetic in-
stincts, wish to devote portion of their
income to improve the environs of their
homes and do something to increase the
attractiveness of the city in which they
live, the water-supply authority should
take cognisance of these developments
and not stand in their way. It should
adjust itself to twentieth century living
and allow citizens to develop their sense
of civic pride. It should not be per-
mitted arbitrarily to decide that all water
used in industry and that water which,
in Dridan’s terms, “finds its way into
the drainage system” must be accorded
a high priority, whereas water used for
gardening and some other domestic tasks
is unessential.
Those who have visited some of the
world’s cities which are built on really
arid land, like Denver and Salt Lake City,

will appreciate that, without adequate
supplies of water for what Dridan called
“ornamental” or “aesthetic” purposes,
these cities would not be what they are
today. The citizens of a city like Sydney,
which is in a superior position climatic-
ally to these places, should not allow
the prejudices of their Water Board
consisting in quite a few cases of aider-
men, who think that to install water
sprinklers in suburban parks is the height
of prodigality—to stand in the way of
civic improvement.
If water has to be saved, the logical
way to do it is to meter the water and
sell it at a price which will encourage
all consumers—in homes, in factories,
and on farms—to be sparing in their use
of this commodity and, in particular, to
avoid waste.
Man of
Affairs
The night before at the reception to
mark the first printing of “News-
week” in Australia, Mr W. P.
Rogers and his fellow-members of the
magazine’s board and management must
have shaken at least 250 guests by the
hand, and murmured as many greetings.
The next morning Mr Rogers, the US
Attorney-General from 1957-61 when he
handed over to Robert Kennedy, showed
few of the after-effects of his ordeal.
A prime example of the American
“man of affairs” Mr Rogers has been
prominent in his own profession of law,
in public service, in politics, in diplom-
acy, and in his association with the Press.
He served in the Eisenhower adminis-
tration, first as Deputy Attorney-General
and then as Attorney-General, both
posts deeply involving him in the now
historic Supreme Court judgments on
civil rights and in the preparation and
guiding through Congress of the first
civil rights legislation since the Civil
War. Thus the first question in the in-
terview was fielded with a certain legal
delicacy. Was there any truth in the
suggestion that Mr Rogers still had un-
fulfilled political ambitions and even had
his eyes set on the White House?
At 52, Mr Rogers felt that he was still
young enough to have unfulfilled political
ambitions, but he was not considering the
White House job. As was the case in the
Eisenhower cabinet, Mr Rogers thought
that if he went back into politics it would
probably be as an appointee although he
did not rule out the chance of standing
for Congress.
In his work Mr Rogers divides his time
between the Park Avenue law firm of
Royall, Koegel, and Rogers in New York
and the family home and other office in
Washington. Commuting between the
two cities and speaking to men in busi-
ness, politics, journalism and the law, Mr
Rogers has noted the way in which the
topic of Vietnam has become the main
conversation piece. Despite the draft-
card burning, the marches, and the poli-
tical and academic dissenters Mr Rogers
did not feel that there was any lack of
support for American objectives in Viet-
nam. He felt that the great majority of
Americans, even in traditionally isola-
tionist areas, felt strong action was need-
ed to stop the advance of Communism.
There was however, a lot of “second
guessing” about whether Vietnam was
the place to make the stand and there
was a great deal of questioning about the
methods being adopted—what Mr Rogers
called “Sunday morning quarter-back-
ing”, analysing and criticising the moves
already made.

Nostalgia Terribly, Terribly IN
Coach lamps , pianolas and plastic cast iron
In Toorak Road, South Yarra,
there is a mod shop called The
General Store. It reeks with
Edwardiana. The string, in the old
ironmonger’s style, is in a little wire
cage and hangs down from the ceiling.
There’s a dear old cash register, big
brass scales, an old clock on the wall
and pots of good Victorian-style ferns.
The fact that The General Store sells
the most aggressive male-snaring
bikinis in all SEI-SE2 has nothing
to do with it.
Nostalgia is terribly, terribly in.
Here in the past few years restaurants
have opened sometimes at the rate
of one a week and unless you have
some good Edwardiana or Victoriana
you don’t rate. The keen man who
foresaw all this in 1960 and went in
for production of gas lamps, coach
lamps and plastic cast iron would have
made a considerable fortune.
For example, just down the way
from The General Store, we have the
Pickwick. This had nice old ochre and
red veranda tiles on the floor, maible-
topped sideboards, lead-lighted win-
dows, gas-style lamps and a truly re-
markable bar which is a combination
of wrought-iron and balusters taken
from an ancient staircase. The pic-
tures on the walls are superbly cor-
rect, 19th-century terribly bad oils
in big frames, of dreamy lake scenes
and bosomy country girls. Perhaps
the most tasteful decor is in the
lavatories, called M’lord and M’lady.
They have cedar panelling through-
out, lovely doors, beautiful sideboards
and 20th-century flushing systems.
Then last Friday night we saw the
opening of the Music Hall Restaurant
in Chapel Street, in the manner fo
George Miller’s Music Hall at Neutral
Bay, Sydney. This place is vast. It
can seat and feed 500 in comfort and
700 in discomfort. Ray McCormack,
one of the joint-operators, calls it
“the biggest music hall restaurant in
the Southern Hemisphere, if not the
world”.
We do things in a big way South
of the Yarra.
Also last week we saw the opening
of The Lamplighter Restaurant in
Bourke Street, City. This is very gas-
light era stuff. The walls are timber,
burnt off with a blow torch, the tables
are padded leather, the carpet and
ceiling are crimson and the lights
gaslike. For atmosphere, they have
an old pedal piano with such pianola
rolls as “Show Me The Way To Go
Home” and “Keep The Home Fires
Burning”.
Oh, it goes on. There’s Fanny’s in
Lonsdale Street. Oh, yes, curse you,
you’ve guessed it. That’s short for
Fanny by Gaslight, and in Little
Collins Street vve have the Little
Reata which goes for pop nostalgia.
There the seats are railway sleepers,
there’s a truly wonderful Wild-West-
era cash register and their best picture
is a very large framed photograph of
the Melbourne Democratic Cricket
Club, 1895. For the real touch of
genius, instead of silver ice buckets
they use large flower pots, and they
make a bottle of Houghton’s white
burgundy look quite charming.
Oh, one could go and talk about
the Stagecoach, the Walnut Tree or
Tikki and John’s. Tikki Taylor and
John Newman opened their restaurant
recently just down the road from the
J. C. Williamson’s Empire and the
walls are all plastered with Edwardian
and Victorian playbills.
We’re all eating as hard and as
nostalgically as we can to keep all
these places alive, but can we stand
the pace? We are told that there
are 1800 restaurant seats in the city
area alone, to say nothing of the gas-
lighted belts of South Yarra, Carlton
and St Kilda.
There’s just one new restaurant that
I failed to mention. This is not in
the Roaring ’Twenties style. It is the
Oriental Gourmet Club in Little
Bourke Street and the decor is very
Chinese. The light arrangement is
quite remarkable, diffused through
3000 open-ended beer cans. The pro-
prietor, Bill Lew, got boys to collect
them at the MCG for 2c a can. The
Oriental Gourmet Club may be the
only truly Melburnian restaurant.

FINE OLD SCOTCH WHISKY A
THE INTELLIGENT WOMAN'S GUIDE
Constant Dripping
There had to be a Romano’s in it
somewhere, so the “Australian
Gourmet Magazine” found them-
selves giving their inaugural launching
dinner in Sydney at Renzo’s, in Rose
Bay, which seemed more in the gourmet
belt than Dad’s old place in the city.
All the right people were there, from
members of the Escoffier Society, the
Wine and Brandy Producers, the tele-
vision ladies, right down to the afternoon
columnists, who are mean men when it
comes to a pie. The prawns, the duck
and the strawberries went down well
with three kinds of appropriate wine,
although it was hard to keep track with
so many executive-type gentlemen ex-
pounding on Traminers and Cabernets,
scarcely letting the ladies get a word in
about their triumphs with mulberry wine
and brandied peaches.
I wanted to ask about some friends
who once made sake from raisins in
a garbage can, somewhere around the
Cross, but it didn’t seem wise. There
are gourmets and gourmets, after all.
Trad, experimental, cooking, non-cook-
ing, all sorts. It wasn’t until Mr Carlos
Zalapa, an ardent wine-and-fooder, arose
at coffee that the platform of the Gour-
met Magazine was revealed.
“We hope to stop Australians cook-
ing with dripping,” Mr Zalapa an-
nounced. A noble cause, of such hope-
lessness that only a sincere and dedicated
gourmet, a real traditional gourmet,
could espouse it.
“I must say I’ve always loved bread
and dripping,” said a woman from the
ABC. She spoke quietly because we
were close to a man called Rodriguez,
obviously in league with Zalapa. Bread
and dripping, plain or toasted, were one
of the joys of her childhood, a security
symbol she still resorted to when the
children were out of the house and she
felt a bit restless. And what of boiled
turnips, mashed with butter and salt?
Were they to go, too?
Her fears were soon set at rest by the
magazine’s editor, Mr Frank Geiringer.
‘Even the humblest food can become
gourmet fare if it is cooked with love
and tenderness,” he said in an earnest
Viennese accent. “There is no reason
why turnips shouldn’t be a dish for the
gods if you treat them properly.”
Mr Geiringer, an expatriate Viennese,
has managed hotels from Spain to
Shanghai, including the Bombay Majestic
and the Calcutta Eastern. He coped
pretty well with caste cooking, because
the very religious Indians didn’t usually
get as far as eating in Western-style
hotels, but trouble came with the In-
dependence, and the consequent pro-
hibition.
Geiringer came to Australia in 1949,
to the horrors of public-service tea in
a Government job, but last year he
abandoned security to get his magazine
under way with the help of an insurance
underwriting firm of two keen gourmets
in Woollahra.
Like Carlos Zalapa, he is an anti-drip-
ping man. “Dripping is what you make
candles out of,” he declared firmly. It
was a peculiarly English custom, un-
known in Europe, and-generally believed
to be caused by British thrift and the
large numbers of beef cattle by-products
which had to be used somehow.
There was plenty of good food about
all that was needed was to teach Aus-
tralians how to cook it, and especially to
convince restaurateurs that brown beef-
cube-and-flour gravy must not be used
indiscriminately on whatever roast meat
happened to be going. He had kind
words, though, for frozen chickens
(“quite palatable if you baste them, and
use patience; Australians are not patient
people, I’m afraid”) —frozen vegetables,
and stock cubes.
“I used to be horrified about packet
soups and soup cubes when I arrived
here,” Mr Geiringer said, “but I see now
they’re a means to a good end, if they
encourage women to experiment with
gourmet dinners.” There was., a wistful
note in his voice as he recalled his
mother, supervising enormous stockpots
in a Viennese hotel kitchen from dawn
until dusk. “Australia is one of the few
countries in the world where the husband
doesn’t come home for lunch,” he said.
“We want to go much further than the
women’s magazine recipes,” he said.
“There’ll be stories about how certain
food and wine came into use, their special
properties, and good solid advice on how
to treat different foods. Even foods that
seem virtually non-existent in Australia,
like goose. There must be some geese
somewhere. Goose fat is indispensable
for gourmet cooking.”
With increasing overseas travel Mr
Geiringer thought Australians were now
ripe for a special gourmet magazine. But
wasn’t a lot of this travelling being
done by elderly dripping-users, and im-
poverished teenagers not likely to get
further than Lyons Corner Shops? Per-
haps, but he believed there were suf-
ficient rising businessmen, and their
wives, to level things out.
“Our main aim is to help the young
executive, his wife, and the people who
find it necessary to entertain their friends
and business associates either at home
or in a restaurant,” he said.
“As well as food and wine we might
even have a section, on, say, gourmet
cigars, or after-dinner liqueurs.”
Mr Geiringer also hopes his magazine
will be of help to the career woman who
wants to impress her boyfriend. He
means well, I suppose, but it’s hard to
see any man worth his boeuf a la mode
tamely letting a woman tell him what’s
wrong with his cigar, or his choice of
wine. The male ego is vulnerable enough
without depriving it of these traditional
props.
He may well fight back by talking
football and car engines for the rest of
the evening.

ENGLAND,
Whose England?
Vietnam and the crisis of confidence
From GEOFFREY FAIRBAIRN in London
English attitudes to Vietnam are not of any great interest except in so far as
they throw light on the country’s present sad malaise. As Malcolm Muggeridge said
recently, English opinion is no more relevant than the opinion of the' Eskimos and
the Laplanders. But, of course, the fact, and the refusal to admit it, is what color
English thinking about the Vietnamese struggle.
One may begin with the young pro-
fessional aristo who thickly pronounced,
“Of course, if we were there, sh’ole
thing'd been over long shince, what?”
There was the stockbroker, a darkly dis-
appointed man of great charm who
asked, hopefully, “The Americans really
are making a mess of it, aren’t they ”
And the beautiful young Jewess who said
angrily, “If the Americans go on like
this, the Russians will bomb London, and
that would be truly serious.” Then there
was the highfalutin (brilliantly so)
youth in the tall building of a news-
paper for whom everything that lay East
of Suez had become a crashing bore.
Envy of anything the Americans tried
to do anywhere and a complete lack of
interest were the two most- common
attitudes. Only one man started asking
about the nature of the struggle in detail;
and he was Freddy Spencer-Chapman
who wrote the epic of guerrilla endur-
ance, “The Jungle is Neutral”. Richard
Gott, a protester fresh from the Royal
Institute of International Affairs, hardly
mustered a company of support when he
fought the Hull by-eJection specifically
on the Vietnam issue.
Of course, there was an Australian
demonstration: eight white banners of
protest were carried around and around
Australia House in the rain. The banner
carrier I spoke with admitted he knew
nothing much about Vietnam, was not
interested enough to ask any questions
when I mentioned en passant that I had
been there recently, but told me that the
list of sponsors had a “very deep”
knowledge of the subject. I looked at
the list. There was Bob Hughes the art
critic, along with six painters and a man
from an art gallery. Then there were
two fiction writers, a musician, and three
people connected with drama, which
made up 14 out of 20 signatories. Of
course, there were academics: a philo-
sopher of science, a statistician, two
anthropologists, an economist and . . .
ah yes, Dr John Burton, who once
declared his belief that the misled Aus-
tralian electorate would probably one day
come to listen to the views of India and
Indonesia on how Australia should act
in international matters rather than
follow their own Government.
Being informed that the banner-
bearers were all Australian post-graduate
students (except, presumably, the one I
spoke to who described himself as “tech-
nically a citizen of the United Kingdom”;
stolid pride is not exactly a feature of
England in 1966) I sought out the Press
representative, also a post - graduate
student, who informed me that perhaps
not all the sponsors were exactly experts
but that the purpose of the demonstration
was to catch the eye of the English
papers. Reports in the English Press,
he gravely informed me, might influence
Australian Government opinion. When I
asked him his name, he gave it to me,
but said it must not be reported. When
I suggested that his request was a little
odd, he could not understand why. I
tried to explain. But he said, cryptically,
“But if it weren’t for people like myself
such organisations would never get under
way.” Doubtless.
But . . . the English. The reason why
the English are either cattily envious or
superiorly bored by the struggle in Viet-
nam is because England is undergoing
a serious crisis of confidence. Of course,
the Left is confident enough as always
in its screeching attitudes of moral
superiority, its blood running hot with
anticipation that in the end the British
Army will be ordered to shoot down
White Rhodesians (an Amritsar is all
right with them so long as the victims
are white), sneering at American soldiers
who are presumed to shoot Vietcong
by day and “return to comfortable
billets at night”, waiting for the moment
that Harold Wilson gets a smacking
majority that wili allow them to alter
a policy that they would never be called
on to make themselves.
And the Government, especially after
Hull, shows no signs of letting a
hideously large rescue-loan and the
probability of a terribly serious balance-
of-payments crisis later in the year dim
its confidence.. “Damn all that, damn
Europe, the country looks prosperous,”
seems to sum up the the mood here.
That it is a “prosperity based on national
bankruptcy”, as a very clever liberal
editor put it, is often admitted privately
but of course would require a much
more forthright leader than Mr Harold
Wilson to admit publicly.
The measure of England’s present sad
malaise can best be judged by the mood
of Tories and Labor men who vote
according to. the dictates of the “hip-
pocket nerve”. The latter are seldom
willing Little Englanders; the former
hardly ever so. The mood has various
manifestations: first, there is a blood-
chilling hatred of dark men exacerbated
by the knowledge that England’s color
problem has been caused by England’s
search for cheap labor for dirty jobs,
further exacerbated by a deep-seated
sympathy for lan Smith’s government,
yet further exacerbated by a vitriolic
loathing of the man Wilson who has
staked British prestige on bringing down
lan Smith “even if it means bringing
down the economy of Central Africa and
Kenneth Kaunda as well”, as an in-
telligent African-sympathising specialist
on that continent put it to me.
Rhodesia has become (along with the
Commonwealth’s slow dying) a kind of
much-too-late-in-the-day symbol of
Britain’s place in the world—and not
only for Tories. But the reason for
choosing this symbol lies not so much in
the Rhodesian mess itself but at home:
in those little flat-vacant notices with
their sentence: For European tenants
only.
It is a very unpleasant experience to
hear a gentle, cultivated Englishman
whose hobby is gardening and who visits
Africa frequently talking about people
“who are just down from the trees” and
then proceeding to justify the remark by
an appeal to history—or rather, as he
would say, the lack of it. It is in a way
even more chilling listening to an African
specialist who is not in any sense a racist
speaking of a “coming struggle for
power” in which “they will go down,
because we have the technology and the
scientific know-how”.
But basically the whole thing is simply
a reflection of a crisis of confidence which
at the silly end finds its expression in the


distinctive
office
furniture
to reflect
your good
taste
inspire your
executives
impress your
clients.

following letter to a newspaper: “The
current use of certain words has now
departed so far from the original con-
notation that I suggest it is time we had
a more up-to-date glossary of terms:
Traitor —owing allegiance to the mon-
arch and refusing to sell one’s country
to Communism; Patriot —one who uses
the monarch for party ends and sings
‘The Red Flag’ in preference to ‘God
Save the Queen’; Loyal toeing the line
dictated by UNO in the interests of
world Communism, etc.”
Now that kind of thinking is not new
to the backwoodsmen of the Tory Party
but the Rhodesian issue—unnecessarily
rendered acute for reasons of folie de
grandeur by Harold Wilson, according
to many intelligent Lories—taken with
the local “color problem” and the now
predominantly “black” Commonwealth
and England’s sinking prestige has caused
it to be reflected, in slightly less sim-
plistic forms, in the thinking of quite a
large number of English people.
“Going down”
are convinced England is “going
down” but neither at home nor abroad
do they feel they know what must be
done. The emotional perks of empire
are difficult indeed to relinquish, even
long after the reality of empire has dis-
appeared. (I remember an Englishman
returning from a gambling session at Le
Toucquet soon after the war. He had
done well at the tables but he was deeply
depressed: the French had been let into
the Casino. Similar distress was observed
amongst Englishmen who found post-war
Venice crowded with rich Italians.)
And this process is all the more dis-
tressing today because an utterly bogus
organisation, the English Crown-tipped
Commonwealth, has for years provided a
facade behind which Englishmen could
avoid facing up to new realities. Men
like Sir Robert Menzies have done their
beloved England a hideous disservice by
persuading Englishmen that they belong
to a truly significant country in terms
of world influence. Nov/ reality is begin-
ning to crowd in quickly and immediate
reactions are ugly when they are not
schizoid. Ugly in many ways beside
those mentioned above: the viciousness
of the private “criticism” of Harold
Wilson, for example. Another example
encountered: Churchill’s Yalta policy
being attributed to his having an Ameri-
can mother! At least the malaise has
evoked one witty remark (at the Aus-
tralia Day reception in Australia House,
of all places, and from an Englishman):
“There’s only one answer now: Great
Britain should withdraw from the Com-
monwealth.”


CATHOLIC
DILEMMAS
Beyond Liberalism and The New Wave
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
Catholics throughout the world are
still trying to divine whether the
most recent Vatican Council was
the product of direct overpowering in-
spirations of the Holy Spirit, the cul-
mination of long years of careful clerical
intrigue by “progressive” cardinals, or
simply the result of a whim of a
generous-minded and unpredictable old
Pope. But all are agreed that Mother
Church (will even this image survive?)
shall never be the same.
After an age of Roman centralism,
papal supremacy and curial bureaucracy,
the most widely spread and compelling
of the world’s religions enters a new life:
a life in which the qualities of intran-
sigence, intolerance and single-minded-
ness are less evident than those of
liberality, extraversion and benevolence.
Debates which raged only a couple of
years back seem suddenly a generation
old. The image of Catholicism as a
theist ideology with its own special kit
of universal answers seems long vanished.
It comes as a shock to remember that
in Australia, where the Church had
always been more concerned with
morality than theology, as late as 1961
two formidable Catholic laymen, Dr
T. K. Suttor and Vincent Buckley, were
locked in public debate over the issue
of religious liberty and the rights of
non-Catholics: Dr Suttor having pub-
lished in “Arna”, the interstate journal
of the Australian Arts Association, that
Catholic theology allowed no rights to
non-Catholics to have their religious con-
victions and practices protected by the
State.
A few months less than three years
ago a scholarly young ex-Catholic, Austin
Gough, and Catholic intellectuals, chief
among them Dr Max Charlesworth, were
embattled in the pages of “Prospect”
over the question of whether it was
possible to be Catholic and a liberal: the
former protagonist taking the view that
“liberal Catholics” are “hopelessly un-
representative”, not practising the logic
of their beliefs, and, in the strict
ecclesiastical sense of the word, “un-
orthodox”.
Mr Gough argued his case well and
with enthusiasm, but one cannot imagine
him advancing it in 1966. Nor, probably,
would he want to; possibly only the
besieged curia itself would take seriously
a weight of argument which only a short
time ago appeared logically and historic-
ally impressive. To the despair of the
ultramontanists, and the amusement of
Malcolm Muggeridge, God and history
seem to be on the side of the liberals.
The fact that slogans such as “Error
has no rights” are no longer respectable
in canonical journals may not much stir
the soul of the suburban Catholic, but
there have been other developments
which have less stirred than staggered
him, chiefly, of course, the birth control
debate.
Consider the case of generations of
Catholics maturing in a society heavy
with English puritanism and being
dogged from adolescence by Irish Jan-
senism: sex, whether enjoyed, tolerated
or despised, often means guilt. Add to
this circumstance the facts that there is
more and more social pressure to raise
small families and that the means of
avoiding conception become readily
available. Complete the picture by super-
imposing a reverend and respected clergy,
whose teaching comes directly from
Christ, which feels itself morally com-
pelled to persistently condemn from
pulpit and pamphlet all chemical, surgical
and mechanical forms of birth control,
and to threaten with the possibility of
eternal damnation those who refuse to
obey the natural law and who live “in
rebellion against God”.
In this situation it is understandable
that the birth control issue has loomed
large in the lives of those Catholic
couples. However they have acted, most
Catholics have been in no doubt, until
recently, about the teaching of the
Church in the matter and the vast
majority would have believed this teach-
ing to have been given with the full
weight of papal infallibility.
The reports from the Council that
many bishops and priests are not happy
with the Church’s traditional stand on
birth control, and the general reopening
of the whole question, have left a con-
siderable number of Catholics lying
in the aisles. Whether they are just
spiritually winded, or suffering some
deeper injury, remains to be seen. But
if the Church significantly changes its
promulgations on birth control, many
ordinary Catholics, unlearned in the
finer mysteries of theology, are going to
judge that the doctrine of papal in-
fallibility is of dubious candlepower.
Whatever the outcome of the birth con-
trol dissension, there was overwhelming
support at the Vatican Council for the
declaration on religious liberty (and con-
siderable applause commanded by Car-
dinal Beran when he asked for penance
for past Catholic sins committed against
religious liberty). The emphasis on
ecumenism and the recognition of the
evils of sectarianism, the concern for in-
creasing the authority and responsibility
of the laity, and the reform of the liturgy
are all signs suggestive of a new spirit
of enquiry and tolerance in an institution
formerly remarkable for its authoritarian
strength.
The conservatives and anti-liberals are
in retreat but they are not, of course,
yet vanquished. Whether clerical or lay
in station, they are deeply suspicious of
moves to increase lay initiative in the
Church; the grace of holy orders, they
feel, generates all the power necessary
to keep the mills of God grinding. In
a crisis they are disposed to take the
word of their pastors as guide: a circum-
stance which has sometimes encouraged
episcopal excesses such as that of Mel-
bourne’s Bishop Fox, who told the faith-

Lysaght Penciline provides all that’s new and
desirable in internal partitions. Its principal
features are galvanized steel framework
and damage resistant vinyl covered steel cladding.
The unique, uncomplicated design gives great
stability and fast erection. The insulated
Marviplate cladding in a wide variety of
colours and stylings gives pleasing appearance
and negligible maintenance.
Commonwealth Experimental Building Station
Sound Control tests have proved
Penciline more effective than conventional
internal walls. Penciline is slim and lightweight.
Being a hollow partition means that service
wiring can be carried within the walls. It
is completely demountable and re-usable, can be
moved at will to suit future accommodation
requirements.

The anti-liberal forces suspect recent
innovations in the liturgy, such as the
English Mass (“why should we meddle
with the faith of our fathers?”); if
educated they are hostile to all forms
of modern philosophy and generally
suspicious of the theory of evolution;
although they seem to accept modern
welfare-State capitalism without much
worry, they often hold t' private theories
of distributism; they are defenders of
the regimes of Franco and Salazar; they
are inclined to see the cold war as
basically a battle between Catholicism
and Communism; although publicly
opposed to the methods of Senator
McCarthy they are inclined to think that
something like him was probably neces-
sary at the time; they feel that the history
of the Church must be largely a history
of physical and ideological siege; their
favorite hymn begins with the words
“Faith of our fathers living still in spite
of dungeon, fire and sword”; their
favorite meditation is on the sorrowful
mysteries of the rosary (Christ’s agony
in the garden at Gethsemane, the scourg-
ing at the pillar, the crowning with
thorns, the carrying of the Cross and the
Crucifixion).
Politically all the Catholic liberals,
until the last few years, proclaimed
themselves to be anti-Communist, anti-
fascist and anti-authoritarian; they were
suspicious of most of the political
machinations and operations which make
up much of the balance of democratic
politics (they rarely know much about
day-to-day political processes and there-
fore save themselves a lot of worry).
They were often hostile to organised
anti-Communists (a frequent contributor
to the liberal “Catholic Worker” last
year described himself as “a zealous anti-
anti-Communist”); they knew that Com-
munists were international trouble-
makers but felt that the West was obliged
to keep making efforts to win the con-
fidence and trust of the ruling parties
of Russia and China. They were wary
sometimes of American intentions and
more often of American practice; they
felt that slogans like “Vietnam is not a
military problem but a political and
social one” contained a lot of truth;
they had a firm loathing of most
American cultural and entertainment ex-
ports, and they commonly believed that
countries go Communist basically for
economic reasons.
The Catholic liberals were often found
searching for signs that might indicate
ideological thawing behind the Iron and
Bamboo Curtains. They were very much
inclined to accept any such portents at
face value (for example, “Catholic
Worker” editorial, December, 1965-
January 1966, “Fresh View on Red
China”, which caused even a frequent
contributor to the “CW” to feel obliged
to write in the following issue that he
wished “to dissent most strongly”). Their
strongest strictures were often reserved
for conservatism or hypocrisy in the
Church itself.
They usually liked to attach adjectives
like “obsessive” and “arid” to anti-Com-
munism and believed that it was their
task to build up the world’s credit of
goodwill and tolerance rather than
investigate the nature of power politics
in the modern world and the necessity
for military solutions for military
problems.
Liberal Utopians
Typically, Australian Catholic liberals
are opposed to the White Australia
policy, censorship, hanging, capitalism
and Iberian politics; they support
ecumenism and want the lay voice in
Church affairs to be louder. Fervent
admirers of Pope John, they regard
Cardinal Ottaviani and the Roman curia
with open mistrust; they wish that Pius
IX had never compiled the “Syllabus of
Errors”; they love their neighbor,
especially if he is Asian or African. Their
favorite passages of the Scriptures were
the Sermon on the Mount (“Blessed are
the peacemakers, etc.”) and Christ’s last
discourse to his Apostler (“A new com-
mandment I give untu you, that ye love
one another . . .”).
Until a few years ago it was almost
possible to divide Catholics into liberal
and non-liberal according to their
attitudes to the Santamaria “movement”
Over the past five or seven years, how-
ever, there has been a significant diver-
gence of opinion amongst Catholic
liberals in their attitude to Santamaria,
the DLP, politics and liberalism itself.
It was most apparent in the attack on the
“Catholic Worker” by “Critic”, an educa-
tional and social broadsheet produced by
a number of Melbourm Catholic gradu-
ates, mostly in their late twenties.
Many factors have contributed to this
cleavage: the slow tightening of the
grip of the Communist and fellow-travel-
ling union machine on important sectors
of the ALP; the Communist military
challenge in Asia; the trans-
parency manipulation of
people of goodwill at “peace” conferences
and other fronts; the filtering-down of
the full horror of the details of the
Khrushchev 20th Congress speech and
the repression of the Hungarian Revolu-
tion; the penetrating attacks on “gutless,
amorphous, gelatinous” liberals by men
such as James McAuley; the powerful,
analytical anti-Communism of Dr Frank
Knopfelmacher and his brilliant seminars
at Melbourne University; increasing
familiarity with- the writings of Orwell
Arendt, Hook, Aron and other highly
intelligent anti-Communists; and even
the broadening political analyses of
Santamaria and some of his top cadres.
“Critic” attacked the “Catholic
Worker” for being unrealistic about
totalitarianism and the possibilities of
“Dialogue with Communists”, for having
an ambiguous attitude to the 1964 Peace
Congress in Sydney and supporting it by
inference, and for displaying naivete in
its interpretation of Pope John’s En-
cyclical “Pacem in Terris”. “Critic” felt
that its attack on some of the political
attitudes prominent in the “Catholic
Worker” was necessary because that
magazine was usually taken to be the
chief organ of Catholic liberalism in this
country, “a guide to the political
attitudes of the progressive Catholic
middle class”, and because some of
its leading members such as John Ryan
and Max Charlesworth were men of
such obvious ability and integrity.
Presumably for similar reasons Pro-
fessor James McAuley remarked in the
“Australian” in the course of reviewing
a book on Cuba that the author “is a
good example of the 'progressiste’ men-
tality of a minority of Catholic intel-
lectuals. His book exudes a mating-
scent which some writers in the ‘Catholic
Worker’ in Australia can hardly fail to
pick up". When challenged by the
“Worker” to back up his aspersion,
McAuley wrote (June, 1965) explaining
that he felt some writers in the magazine
were guilty of:
(1) A failure to confront realistically the
problem that Communism sets us by
its skilled application of the “organ-
isational weapon” over the whole field
of political warfare:
(2) a tendency to think hopefully about
a Dialogue with Communists without
stating the proper conditions for such
a Dialogue;
(3) a disposition to deny the right of
self-defence by all military means up
to and including willingness if need
be to use nuclear weapons;
(4) a tendency to be indulgent to neutral-
ism of the Nehru kind, “which 1
believe to be intellectually untenable
and morally and politically destruc-
tive”;
(5) and of a tendency to minimise the
evil involved in Communist leverage
on the defence and foreign policies
of the ALP.
“The Catholic Worker” responded to
the “Critic” attack with rather more
hysteria than liberalism. An editorial
in April, 1965, hurled terms like “in-
sincere humbug”, “juvenile”, “inside
dopester” around with a fury surprising
in a magazine which normally takes such
pains to propose “charitable and tolerant”
Dialogue between Catholics and their

And a car for all reasons, too. Not ours
alone, but those of automotive authori-

is an extract from ‘Road Test’, a maga-
zine that accepts no automobile adver-
tising, the better to remain unbiased.
The editors are biased, of course, in that
they can’t abide a shoddy automobile.
We quote: “There are very few cars
which are directly competitive with the
Rover 2000 or even try to be. It could
best be described as a GT car, designed
to carry four passengers in supreme
comfort at high speeds over all kinds of
roads, with considerable economy. It
Is, of course, useful for general family
puttering, but this would seem to be a
waste of a good thing. It could also be
described as a sports car, inasmuch as
it will handle corners and curves with
an agility completely unexpected in a
sedan. Most of all, it is a quality car,
built to exacting tolerances by crafts-
men with a proud heritage. We regret
that we can’t say as much about some
of its British cousins which cost more
money . . .” “What makes the 2000 dif-

ferent to start with is its unique unit con-
struction which combines light weight
wih immense strength. Equally up-to-
date is the braking system. Dunlop disc
brakes are used on all four wheels. A
warning light is connected to the master
cylinder of the hydraulic system to warn
of low brake fluid. This is a safety feature
which could well be required by law on
all cars. Of particular interest is the fact
that the complete car was designed
around radial cord tyres which offer vast-
ly improved road holding and up to three
times the tread life of conventional
American tyres. Medical advice was
sought and used in the bucket seat de-
sign, and never before have there been
automobile seats which give such pro-
per support in the small of the back.
Even the ventilation system is different;
for a purpose. Two outlets direct cold air
to the face to help’prevent drowsiness,
even when the heater is used." The edi-
tors of ‘Road Test’ rate the Rover 2000
as a ‘‘best buy”. So, we respectfully sub-
mit, will you.

former opponents. From the tone of
these replies it appeared that an exposed
nerve had been hit.
The clear fact is that the columns of
the “Catholic Worker” reflect the present
crisis of Catholic liberalism in Aus-
tralia. To some extent these conflicts
mirror a crisis in liberalism throughout
the Western world, a crisis which has
been described with rare insight in the
writings of Reinhold Niebuhr and Sidney
Hook.
The “Sermon on the Mount” Catholic
liberals believe, along with many other
liberals whom Niebuhr calls “soft
Utopians”, that the character of in-
dividuals rather than social systems and
arrangements are the guarantee of the
just society; that appeals to love, good-
will and brotherhood are bound to be
efficacious in the end; that if they have
not been so to date we_ must have more
appeals to love, goodwill and brother-
hood. They also believe that wars are
stupid and evil, and therefore can only
be caused by people who are more stupid
and evil than those who recognise the
inherent irrationality and moral horror
of war.
The stance of a Catholic liberal, such
as Morris West, to the downward thrust
of Asian Communism in Vietnam might
very well fall within the boundaries of
Niebuhr’s description of Christian
liberals who have no understanding of
the complex problems of justice.
Politics aside, the two contending
branches of Catholic liberalism today
have a great deal in common inside the
Church. They share common ground in
urging lay initiative, less clericalism, litur-
gical reform, a Gospel-based theology,
the minimising of the Roman bureau-
cracy, Christian tolerance of conflicting
faiths, and the clear separation of
Church and State.
Their problem, inside the Church, is
that there are signs that this tradition
is losing its attractive power amongst the
laity. Apart from Melbourne, the
Catholic university societies have de-
clined into minor Catholic holding
societies, and the Melbourne Newman
Society, whilst maintaining its numbers,
no longer seems to generate much intel-
lectual ferment. The “Catholic Worker”
in recent years has found itself almost
unable to attract younger members to
its councils and it is still struggling des-
perately for circulation and finance.
“Prospect", which shifted headquarters
to Sydney, has not so much died as
faded away. Nowhere does there appear
any group of Catholics under their mid-
twenties with any religious fixations,
theological enthusiasms, or even fantasies,
which they are determined to parade or
have accepted.
The cause of this malaise may lie
partly in the papacy of John XXIII and
the reforms introduced by the Vatican
Council. Catholic liberalism, especially
amongst the laity, gained some of its
strength from sheer reaction to the
clericalism, Jansenism and stolid sacra-
mentalism of the Australian Church.
Now that even Cardinal Gilroy is in
obedience to the Pope’s wishes, relatively
enthusiastic for a modicum of reform,
there is not so much to excite the an-
tagonism and reformist energies of a
militant laity. Religious liberalism is the
new wave amongst a previously con-
servative clergy. The immediate benefits
it will provide for Christianity through-
out the world, under the banners of
ecumenism, doctrinal tolerance and
religious brotherhood, are obvious. Of
equal importance to the world will be
the power of the newly inspired priest-
hood to resist the temptation to accept
the vices of liberalism as well as the
virtues.

FBISTIVAL
UMA-’GO
Racing cars, torch-lit parades, “fast-
draw” shooting contests, and hundreds
of celebrations will make your 1966
visit memorable.
Charming hoop-skirted hostesses will welcome
you to the Natchez Pilgrimage in Mississippi
(March 6-April 3) for a re-creation of the
romantic 1860’s. Delightful tableaux and
tours of plantations add glamour and spec-
tacle to the occasion.
Fiesta, rodeo, and fun in the West
San Antonio, Texas, becomes a carnival of
light and gaiety during Fiesta (April 15-23).
Illuminated floats on the river, a Battle of
Flowers, and a Flambeau Parade make this
a brilliant spectacle.
A most exciting four days and nights take
place at the Las Vegas, Nevada, “Helldorado”
(May 19-22). At daily rodeos, cowboys tame
wild bulls and broncos, compete in “fast-draw”
contests. Star entertainers and gambling add
to the excitement.
Further west in Angels Camp, California,
mirth reigns at the Jumping Frog Jubilee
(May 19-22). Overseas visitors may enter a
frog in the contest free —winner gets $1,000!
You can pan for gold in nearby streams —or
go on to San Francisco, a few hours away.
Fast cars, classical music
It takes matchless control to win the USA’s
famous auto race, the Indianapolis 500 in
Indiana. Time trials and galas begin mid-May,
go on until race day, May 30. Later, you
should visit Detroit to see typical American
cars being made.
Tropical Puerto Rico plays host to a great
musical event—the Casals Festival (June 1-17).
Pablo Casals himself occasionally conducts
the orchestra, chorus, and soloists.
More travel bargains than ever!
For example, 99 days’ bus travel costs just

LETTERS
The Geneva Conventions
SIR. —I would like to correct an im-
pression given by the letter of Messrs.
H. S. Blanks, A. E. Carey, 1. Firth, A.
Fischer, I. Morrison, and VV. Sparkes
(8., Feb. 12).
The implication by these gentlemen
that our troops are not “fully instructed”
in the Geneva Conventions is not only
utterly incorrect, but one which could
only have been made by someone who
has no knowledge of Army training and
procedures. Every Australian soldier is
instructed in the terms of the Geneva
Conventions as part of his basic training
at the Recruit Training Battalions. Every
soldier receives a copy of “The Soldier's
Flandbook”, which contains an annexe
summarising his rights and obligations
under the Geneva Conventions. Every
soldier receives a copy of “The Soldier’s
before going overseas, a special pamphlet
containing a summary of the Geneva
Conventions. Every soldier who is a mem-
ber of a unit about to go overseas re-
ceives instruction in the terms of the
Geneva Conventions as part of his unit’s
pre-embarkation training.
As well as this, every unit in the Aus-
tralian Army is issued with a unit guide
to the Geneva Conventions dealing with
the treatment of prisoners of war, rights
of prisoners of war, treatment of wound-
ed and sick, treatment of civilians, oblig-
ations imposed by the Conventions, and
definitions of breaches of the Conven-
tions.
In the light of this, to suggest that
Australian troops are not fully aware of
their rights and responsibilities under
the Conventions is quite incorrect.

Death Duties
SIR. I strongly object to your South
Australian political correspondent’s
report (8., Feb. 2) regarding the Suc-
cession Duties Bill which was rejected
by the Legislative Council. The Bill was
not misunderstood; on the contrary, it
was because a wide section of the com-
munity came to understand the Bill very
well that it was so vigorously opposed.
It was not, as your correspondent
stated, a fact that the Bill would have
lightened the burden of death duties on
estates of $38,000 or less and increased
them over that figure. An increase in
duty on an estate as low as $19,000
passing to a widow was apparent under
the amending Bill. The Opposition said
quite frankly that they would approve a
Bill that granted increased concessions
to widows and increased the duty on
larger estates, but they rightly rejected
the legislation before the Council which,
in some cases, penalised widows and
levied higher duties on quite moderate
estates.

The Unqualified Employer
SIR. Donald Brook, in his article
“The Unqualified Employer” (8., Jan.
29), has drawn attention to the prob-
lems of professional art education in
New South Wales and insofar as his own
unhappy experiences are concerned, I
am not able to comment. He does, how-
ever, draw attention to problems and
attitudes which are much more wide-
spread ;n Australia, and there can be few
art teachers in tertiary institutions who
would not agree with his observations
concerning the necessity for a better
understanding of the special needs of the
art school in terms of staff, accommo-
dation, equipment and not least in the
quality of student entering into courses
of study.
His title misled me initially, since his
criticism is clearly directed at the Tech-
nical Education Division of New South
Wales, and not at the equally important
employer from commerce and industry
and, in the final analysis, the general
public. The traditional role of the art
school, including most of those “great”
schools is one of acceptance of the
responsibility to train professional artists
in all fields and to provide every facility
for the encouragement and nurturing of
artistic activities in the community as a
whole. The support and encouragement
given to the art school by the community
at large is at least as important as the
contribution of the nominal caretaker.
In this respect most, if not all, art
schools in Australia have been at a dis-
advantage. The fact that Technical Edu-
cation Divisions in my own and in other
States have accepted the responsibility
for the art school is to be commended,
for as he well knows, art education at
this level is a complex and often pre-
cocious child, however enlightened and
sympathetic its mentors may be.
1 do not dispute the fact that in most
areas of training the Australian art school
falls behind the achievements of many
great schools in other places. Technical
education has for a long time been the
poor relation in the scheme of general
education, and the art school itself has
not in the past always had people who
could communicate their needs to
authority. This, combined With a general
apathy from artists, employers, and the
public alike, makes it all the more re-
markable that the art school has survived.
Mr Brook does a service to all of us
in drawing attention to the broader issues.
It is a pity that he has seen fit to with-
draw from the field at a time when tech-
nical education as a whole is on the
threshold of most exciting and challeng-
ing developments, developments in which
this art school will play a significant and
necessary role.

ENGLAND AND THE
CATHOLICS
80 Years Ago: February 27, 1886
XHE Englishman has proved himself a
sturay conqueror and an admirable
colonist. But in one thing he is entirely
deficient the art of conciliating those
whom he subdues. This, perhaps, is not so
much Bull s fault as the fault of the ruling
classes vho, for centuries, denied him
knowledge while cultivating his prejudices.
Now that a suffage but one remove from
universal has toppled the "upper" classes
from the elevation they so long usurped
and disgraced, the political tutelage of the
Englishman may be said to have ended. It
will, of course, take time and training to
bring the ordinary Briton in line with the
advanced doctrines of today. And this
brings us to the small number of Catholics
returned for English constituencies. It is
not to the absence'' of candidates of that
creed, nor to their ineligibility, that the
fact is due. It is to the prejudices en-
gendered by centuries o f class government.
We are no lovers of Lome or of her teach-
ings. But we trust the day is at hand when
the fact of a man's believing in one God
or three, or none at all, will be kept
severely out of sight by an enlightened
democracy, and that a person's fitness or
unfitness to make laws will not depend
upon the meridian under which he hap-
pened to be born, or the faith he imbibed
with his mother's milk.
The Monash Teach-in
SIR. I am grateful for Mr Samuel’s
courtesy in explaining (8., Feb. 5) why
he believes some of the Monash staff
attempted to prevent Dr Knopfelmacher
from appearing at the Monash teach-in.
Grateful, but unconvinced.
Of the three professors he names,
McMahon Ball is a professor of Mel-
bourne University, which, Mr Samuel
will recollect, is not the same place as
Monash. As a departmental colleague of
Professor J. D. Legge, I know as a
certainty that he never at any time
attempted to stop the students inviting
Dr Knopfelmacher to speak. (Why,
incidentally, hasn’t Mr Samuel accepted
Professor Legge's denial on this point?)
Far from being among those who wish
to gag Dr Knopfelmacher, Professor
Legge was one of the first academics to
protest in public against Sydney Univer-

The Fugitive
SIR. —Frank Roberts was obviously in
the kitchen making himself a snack
during the telecast of last week’s Fugitive
episode. In his review (8., Feb. 19) he
says Kimble found his one-armed man,
who, after admitting to the killing of
Kimble’s wife, dies. The one-armed man,
in fact, is very much alive, fully re-
covered from his accident and is now a
fugitive himself, running from the re-
lentless pursuit of Kimble.

Merinos
SIR. I read with interest your article
(8., Feb. 5) “Improvement after Reten-
tion”. I found this article most interest-
ing, but I find it necessary to correct one
paragraph in this article dealing with the
Australian Merino Wool Campaign. In
the paragraph you stated:—“The Free
Market committee was closely allied
with the Merino Wool Campaign com-
mittee. The Merino Wool Campaign
committee was largely the creation of
the late George Falkiner Boonoke is
one of the Falkiner stud properties. Both
the Free Market committee and the
Merino Wool Campaign committee are
closely allied with the NSW Graziers’
Association.”
The Australian Merino Wool Cam-
paign Committee was formed in Decem-
ber, 1962, by a group of people interes-
ted in the improvement of Australian
Merino wool. Mr G. B. S. Falkiner was
not one of these people, because he died
in October, 1961. Whilst Mr Falkiner
had discussed the necessity of continual
improvement of Merino wool with my-
self and others for many years, he had
never intimated that a committee should
be formed to promulgate the importance
of improvement.
The Australian Merino Wool Cam-
paign Committee has never been allied
to any one organisation in the wool
industry. It has, and is, a completely
independent organisation on its own.
Whilst the members of the committee
are themselves members of various
graziers’ associations both in New
South Wales and Queensland, there is no
official link between the committee and
the New South Wales Graziers’ Associa-
tion.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Electronic Worship
By TERRY STAPLETON
Decca’s in North Adelaide, is a sort
of dollar arcade. A block of old
cottages has been converted into
a modern-looking complex comprising a
restaurant (indoor and outdoor), a wine
store, a recording studio, an auditorium,
a hat shop, a lamp shop, a dress shop
and a beauty salon. The man behind all
this, with a long, well-bred finger in
these and other stylish pies, is Derek
(family nickname Decca) Jolly.
Jolly is tall and lean and moves with
economy and elegance He has dark,
longish, straight hair, parted on the left,
very British. In his face, ruggedness,
sensitivity and even petulance fight a
strange battle. His age seems to fluctuate
with his moods. He looks 27 going on
45. He is in fact 38.
He talks about himself eagerly, un-
selfconsciously, rapidly. His thoughts flit,
tumble, recover, trip. He rarely finishes
a sentence; restlessness often compels an
“and so forth” before his mind side-
tracks, backtracks or races on.
A car-racing career (1948-62) brought
him national prominence, immense ex-
hilaration and a forest of cups which
adorn his shelves. It was interrupted
seriously by a “blindingly bad accident”
in Melbourne in 1958. During the last
half-mile of a 100-mile race the radius
rod on his Lotus dug into the road and
the car cartwheeled into a tree. Jolly
finished with the chassis over his shoul-
der, 17 fractures and, ultimately, a more
rugged profile.
London-born, Australian-bred, Jolly is
the son of a colorful adventurer-wanderer
(“I think it's rubbed off in a 20th-century
sort of way”) and great-great-grandson of
Dr Rawson Penfold (hence the family
money and a lingering fascination with
the wine industry).
His Decca’s enterprise seems to be a
determined attempt to have Europe and
eat it too. He wants Decca’s to be a
place where people can find food, wine,
paintings and recording facilities of inter-
national standard. He admits the unit is
virtually a personal hobby-shop but
insists that making it a commercial
success is supplying the sort of challenge
he’s always wanted. He remains con-
science-stricken with remembrance of
things not passed (university, account-
ancy, etc.) and has tended to live in the
shadow of a younger, more stable, mo r e
academically brilliant brother. In
Decca’s, Jolly sees his chance for a sense
of achievement, acclaim and, perhaps, an
eventual monument.
Artistically, the most controversial
and significant enterprise to emerge tfius
far from his recording studios has .been
the “Sound and Image” recitals. These
concerts achieve considerable aural,
visual and emotional impact by using a
mixture of color slides (rear projected,
lap dissolved, rotated), music, sound
effects and narration. A Christmas, 1965,
concert in Bonython Hall was rushed
and packed and occasioned great excite-
ment, stimulation and praise.
Rehearsals have begun for a two-part
“Sound and Image” programme for the
Festival of Arts. First half: experiments
—poetry written by a computer; elec-
tronically designed images and music;
primitive, improvisational dancing by
South American Antonio Rodrigues.
Second half: lonesco’s “The Mire”
being the literal disintegration of a man
who longs to escape his body and to
romp, unfettered, with his mind. The
45-minute disintegration will be narrated
by actor Alexander Hay. Other ingredi-
ents: eight operators, seven projectors,
400 slides, 40 speaker consoles and four
dimmers.
Jolly’s part in all this is hard to assess,
harder to communicate. “Sound and
Image” is the exciting offspring of a
somewhat uneasy marriage of con-
venience between Jolly and Polish-born
artist Stan Ostoja-Kotkowski. The con-
venience stems from Ostoja’s impressive
imagination and Jolly’s impressive bank
account. The uneasiness stems from
their interdependence which seems
mutually disagreeable.
Ostoja insists that Jolly’s only con-
tribution to “Sound and Image” has been
in providing the lavish equipment neces-
sary. He claims that all praise for the
creative conception belongs to himself
and Adelaide artist John Dallwitz; be-
tween them the two artists shoot and
operate the slides, selec* material, music
and effects. Jolly says; “Stan is Polish.
They’re like the Russians. They think
they invented everything.”
Unable to paint or play a musical
instrument, Jolly relies on photography
(“the act of pressing a button is the only
creative part of me I can find at the
moment”) for expression.
With his money and his car-racing and
his other arty enterprises, Jolly is often
compared with Kym Bonython. But he
won’t play. “Compared with Kym,” he
says, “I'm only a dreamer.”
Derek Jolly seems genuine, sensitive,
likeable. His faults art the traditional
ones of the silver spoon set and so are
his anxieties. He wants to be liked and
respected and sought after for himself
and his talent. Not just because he’s
the man who can afford the equipment.
THEATRE
O’Neill’s Moonshine
A Moon for the Misbegotten. Eugene
O’Neili. Old Tote Theatre, Sydney.
Hans, The Witch and the Gobbin. Indepen-
dent Theatre, Sydney.
O’Neill family provided materia]
for melodrama, if ever a family did.
O’Neill’s mother was addicted to drugs
and his brother to alcohol. O'Neill him-
self was tubercular and both he and his
father, while not actually alcoholics,
were over-fond of whisky. In “Long
Day’s Journey into Night” O’Neill was
able to write about them, and himself,
with clear-eyed compassion, without
romanticising their virtues nor exaggerat-
ing their faults. But, as the Gothic title
presages, “A Moon for the Misbegot-
ten”, in which O’Neill’s brother re-
appears, has a strong tendency to melo-
drama.
The first act, which takes place in
daylight, contains some marvellous
comedy. But later on, under the in-
fluence of two kinds of moonshine (it
is 1923 and Prohibition), things deterior-
ate.
As well as excess of whisky, Jim
Tyrone is suffering from a chronic split
in his mother-image. He adores his
mother, associates with whores, and is
tormented by a sense of sin. Josie Hogan,
who is in love with Jim, has got into a
muddle over her own image. Almost
six feet tall and as powerful as any man,
Josie believes that no man would find
her attractive. So she pretends, out of
some peculiar pride, to be brazenly
promiscuous. Meanwhile. Jim is, looking
to her to be a substitute mother, pure
and forgiving, on whose breast he can
weep out his sins.
Despite long and embarrassing
stretches of dialogue, in which O’Neill
dots every i several times over, the
dramatic suspense h sustained through
the intricacies of the plot. The fact that
the play itself suffers from a split
between sunlit comedy and moonlit melo-
drama gives the producer (Robin Love-
joy) a difficult task. But he has an
excellent cast and the production is
well worth seeing in spite of the flaws in
the play.
Stewart Ginn gives a wonderfully
comic and sensitive performance as the
mercurial Phil Hogan, Josie’s wild Irish


father. Jacqueline Kott is very moving
as the womanly Josie sorrowing in the
moonlight over her new-found, but for-
ever lost, lover. She is rather less at
ease as the brassy hoyden. Jim Tyrone,
middle-aged adolescent, is the least
successful character in the play, but this
is O’Neill’s fault. Ron Haddrick gives a
very skilful performance, lacking only
in immaturity. Ron Reid’s setting with
its ramshackle Connecticut frame house
is very well done.
Daisy Crowfoot, in “Hans, The Witch
and the Goblin”, is a deprived witch
who, because she sprang full-grown from
a burning bush, has no childhood
memories. So she steals Princess Alicia’s
memories and pops them in a phial, with
a neat label. Before the play is over she
has quite a collection, while most of the
Court are rushing around the forest in
circles not knowing who they are.
Both imaginative and funny, this de-
lightful play was originally written for
the Manchester Children’s Theatre.
Noelann Gandon’s lively production has
the advantage of a really splendid witch
in David Goddard. Never still for a
moment, darting and skipping and
dancing about, Mr Goddard’s tireless
but disciplined exuberance makes him
an excellent actor in children’s plays. A
strong supporting cast includes Bill Far-
ley as the aristocratic swineherd, Sylves-
ter, Mary Meares as Mrs Crabtree, a
woebegone witch-diviner, and Neil
Duck-Chong as the perplexed King.
Michelle’s forest settings are attractive
and the costumes and make-up are most
imaginative. Daisy’s striped dress and
orange wig, exactly copied by her doll-
familiar, come from the witches’ Dior.

Speaking for Itself
STEWART GINN as Phil Hogan.
A Break in the Music. Playhouse, Perth.
Tn his programme notes for “A Break
in the Music”, being given its world
premiere at the Festival of Perth, Alan
Seymour calls it “a simple piece of
theatre . . . which will speak for itself”.
He then proceeds to make a liar of him-
self, embellishing this simple piece of
theatre with much that is extraneous. It
is basically a good play, attractively
fashioned in an untidy way. The semi-
biographical story of a Fremantle boy-
hood is staged over a random picking
of memories, not all in time sequence.
At no time does this device become un-
wieldy, and credit must go here largely
to Alan Hopgood, playing the central

from 40-year-old man to teenager and

There are one or two dead spots, par-
ticularly when Derek is away from the
real people of his family, and these are
compounded by Seymour not allowing
the play to speak for itself, but putting
the interpretation into the mouth of the
contemporary Derek Nichols, who speaks
them, steps back into the stage to act
them, and then returns —and this seems
unnecessary—to hammer home the mes-
sage the audience has just seen.
The “off-stage” contemporary role of
Derek's wife Dorothy could, in fact,
have been dropped completely without
loss . . . unless she is made more
obviously like the teenage boy's lover-
confidante Eleanora, and there is no
indication in the play that this resem-
blance was intended.
Nita Panned, as Derek’s mother, was
in a role that might well have been
written for her, managing to maintain
sympathy through her coarseness, bigotry,
and a full range of comedy. Margaret
Ford and her deadpan daughter, Mavis,
and James Bailey as the seaman-
wharfie, were fully plausible; Rosemary
Barr as Eleanora gave probably her best
performance.

Sex and the Single Girl. Director, Richard
Quine. Regent Theatre, Sydney.
npHE name of Pontius Pilate (and I
A really don't think he was jesting all
that much) is inevitably associated with
the question “What is truth?” He prob-
ably didn’t stay for an answer because
he knew damned well he wasn’t going
to get one.
Jean Genet has worked it out, even
if not entirely to his satisfaction, that
the only ultimate truth- is death. Life
can be romanticised, so can sin and
violence and even the deaths of others,
but not the fact of death. After birth
(also an undeniable fact) we spend our
lives making life bearable by fantasy
until we undeniably cease to exist.
“The Balcony” is set in a highly
organised brothel in an unidentified city
at present racked by bloody revolution.
The madame. unconcerned, knows that,
whoever seizes political power, she will
still have clients clamoring for the
specialite de la maison the oppor-
tunity to live their dreams for a while
and for a fee.
Ben Maddow’s screenplay sometimes
adds to Genet's original the police
chief’s interpolated speech is a brilliant
parody of every politician’s rallying-crv
but also diminishes it. But what
remains is stimulating, scarifying, funny.
“Lady L” is dedicated completely to
amusement, and very delightful enter-
tainment it is. this light-hearted tale of
an 80-year-old great lady who scandalises
a pompous would-be biographer with the
real story of her rise to the aristocracy
(which incidentally involves a brothel
run very much on the lines of Madame
Irma’s). Peter Ustinov’s direction is
stylish, witty, frivolous; Sophia Loren
gives one of her best and most subtle
comedy performances.
Despite its bold title and the elbow-
in-the-ribs advance publicity, “Sex And
The Single Girl” is a highly moral film
which proves that nice single girls are
rewarded by becoming nice married
ladies. Though not in the “Lady L”
class, it’s a very pleasant diversion.
BEVERLEY TIVEY
MUSIC
As Good as a Feast
Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Conductor,
John Hopkins.
first three of the ABC’s 1966 series
of Sydney Promenade Concerts, with
the Town Hall cleared of seats and banks
of greenery separating audience and
orchestra, were a promising start for the
season. The concerts, conducted by John
Hopkins, vindicate those who, for years,
have campaigned for more adventurous
programming. The composers represented
in these three programmes were Beet-
hoven (twice), Berlioz, Davies, Dvorak
(twice), Mahler, Monteverdi, Nielsen,
Sculthorpe, Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky.
Of the 12 works heard, no less than
eight were uncommon fare, at least six of
them either first Sydney performances
or the first for over a decade.
Credit for such fine programming
goes to John Hopkins, the ABC’s
Director of Music: that he also prepared
and conducted all these work's himself
shows admirable determination, though
one might wish the ABC had a pool of
fine conductors in reserve who could
take turns at coping with so major an
undertaking. The only thing to militate
against full enjoyment of almost every
piece heard so far was the Town Hall’s
renowned acoustics.
The quality of performances in this
series has shown steady improvement.
In the first concert, only one work
emerged as wholly satisfactory: Peter
Sculthorpe’s “Sun Music”, heard in
Sydney for the first time. This was very
favorably received by English critics
after its Commonwealth Festival pre-
miere and I find that it improves with
every hearing. Using strings, brass and
percussion, Sculthorpe has constructed
an impressive collage of sound, some of
it auite menacing and wrought with fierce
feeling.
The second concert was more suc-
cessful. The excerpts from Monteverdi’s
“Vespers of the Blessed Virgin” are as
modern and exciting now as they must
have seemed in 1610. The performance
lacked some of the style this music calls
for, but it was intelligently directed and
very well played by instrumental soloists
and orchestra.
Peter Maxwell Davies’ “Fantasia on
an In Nomine of John Taverner” was
another Sydney premiere. Davies (who
will spend some time at Sydney Univer-
sity later this year) has written a very
colorful piece, using various wind
timbres, a ’cello-oboe combination,
hand-bells, etc., and has imbued his
music with a haunting quality that I will
not quickly forget.
The third concert proved the best yet.

Stravinsky’s “Capriccio for piano and
orchestra” had been last played here by
the late Noel Mewton-Wood in July,
1945, with Sargent conducting. Gordon
Watson appeared to play the difficult
piano score very well but this is music
of a quiet, intricate texture and the acous-
tics of the hall, with the piano drowned
by orchestral sound of insufficient crisp-
ness, left me in some doubt of what the
work really sounded like.
The “Love Scene” and “Romeo’s
Reverie and Fete of the Capulets” from
Berlioz’ grand “Romeo and Juliet”
fared much better. Clearly, Mr Hopkins
has considerable affection for Berlioz.
PAUL FROLICH
TELEVISION
Love Is What?
T ast week public affairs television took
two notable steps backward. The
first was Ann Deveson’s “Love Is Love”,
an excessively ladylike programme of in-
terviews with female sex deviates, which
managed to suggest that it is all rather
like a harmless girls’ party. Two even-
ings later “Mavis Bramston”, by now
an expert commentator on the queer side
of life, gave us a more honest account
of it in a Ronnie Stevens sketch. If
this left most viewers unamused, Miss
Deveson’s timid approach could only
leave us bewildered.
It contained not so much as an im-
plication that there are two “sexes” of
female deviates, and that jealousy among
them often leads to violence, and prison
or mental hospital. It was stated that
young girls are never seduced or re-
cruited. Drug-taking was not mentioned.
The trouble lay in Miss Deveson’s
method, which was to let the female
homosexuals, as they preferred to call
themselves, give their views on the subject
and let it go at that. Naturally those
views were heavily biased.
“Mavis Bramston” also cast a cold
eye at Project ’66 last week. It could
have been worse, had the comment been
aimed at episodes such as last week’s
“On the Wool Track”, a broad misnomer
if ever one was.
The new “Mavis Bramston” Show,
under a cloud for misusing parts of Sir
Robert’s final Press conference, blithely
came on last week with a send-up of Mr
Holt, his wife and three stepdaughters-
in-law. It was cruel, but legitimate
comment on recent Press photographs
and television interviews. So far, the
“Mavis Bramston Show” seems all the
better for the absence of its “star”, Gor-
don Chater, whose main talents were in
eating pies or having them squashed on
him. The new man, Ronnie Stevens, is
funnier in more ways.

‘Ain’t White Folks Got Rhythm?’
By PETER COLEMAN
The Making of a President, 1964. Theodore
H. White. Cape. $6.60.
Crisis in Black and White. Charles E.
Silberman. Cape. $5.15.
A privately made film shows Barry
Goldwater in his San Francisco
hotel suite at the precise moment of his
victory at the 1964 Republican Conven-
tion in the Cow Palace. Goldwater is
watching TV, his eyes glazed, his face
pensive. Now he smiles wryly, says:
“Ain’t white folks got rhythm?”,
laughs, and lapses into silence. “A young
man enters the room,” says Theodore
H. White, “bends over, kisses his hand;
and then Goldwater sits alone again,
pensive, peering through the black horn-
rimmed glasses, and one is conscious of
how handsome a man this is, with the
white hair and the firm lines and how
perplexed, how utterly joyless is his mien
at this hour of victory.”
This joylessness, interspersed occa-
sionally with the gaiety of desperation,
marked the Goldwater campaign in 1964.
It was not exciting like the Kennedy-
Nixon contest which Kennedy won by a
whisker and which he claimed he would
have lost if Nelson Rockefeller had been
the Republican candidate. The 1964
election was over before it began as far
as the result was concerned; even Gold-
water's supporters knew he had no
chance of winning, and Goldwater cam-
paigned accordingly, like a doomed
prophet in the wilderness.
Yet the election will always have a
certain fascination, not because Gold-
water ever had a chance, but because of
the questions it raised and the silent
thinking it must have forced American
voters to do. By 1964 the Left-liberal
orthodoxy which had dominated America
since F. D. Roosevelt’s first Administra-
tion had been worked out. As White puts
it in the new volume of his series on
American elections, the labor unions had
been freed but become ponderous
bureaucracies like the Steelworkers or
hoodlums’ rackets like the Teamsters,
the biggest free trade union in the world.
Throughout all America except the South
Negroes had won every civil right but
were in a mood of racist violence. Pros-
perity, welfare, education, home owner-
ship had spread but the quality of life,
the sense of freedom or at least of satis-
faction had declined. Americans had
handed over $lOO billion of their tax
money to foreigners as aid which
seemed only to make more enemies for
America. The sense of direction had
gone, and perhaps the real tragedy of
President Kennedy’s assassination is that
he died before he could establish a new
sense of direction.
Goldwater's uniqueness it that for the
first time in over 30 years here was a
major Presidential candidate who chal-
lenged radically, if crudely the
liberal ideology, who set out to offer “a
choice, not an echo.” He did it in the
name of conservatism, but his own ide-
ology was Right-wing radicalism. John-
son’s was, paradoxically, the more
conservative voice, and while he struck
the classic conservative note: “We’re in
favor of a lot of things and we’re against
mighty few”, Goldwater issued the
radical cry of Babylon!, shouted Israel
had grown fat! and scolded Americans
for abandoning their country to social-
ism, bureaucracy, appeasement, crime,
immorality. Is this the sort of America
you want? he asked with obvious sin-
cerity.
He aroused tremendous enthusiasm
among a few supporters but at least three
things went wrong. First, he was a
lousy candidate and knew it. He lacked
enthusiasm for the campaign. His ele-
ment was the off-the-cuff crack in con-
genial company: “Let’s lob one into the
men’s room at the Kremlin!”; “I'd like
to see the eastern seaboard disappear
into the Atlantic”; “Why not abolish
social services?”; “You can’t legislate
race prejudice out of the heart”. This
was all right at a Phoenix grocers’ annual
dinner but fatuous in a national debate.
The slogan “In your guts you know he’s
nuts” was a cruel one, but made the
point: he obviously did not have Presi-
dential timbre.
Secondly, he had no real programme.
It is one thing to point out that the
country has lost its sense of direction,
but his only solution was to “get tough
with the Reds” and “give the people
back their freedom”. It is true he knew
far more about missiles and bombers
than most of his critics (he is a tech-
nical expert), or that he opposed segre-
gation, but this did not result in a general
or detailed plan of action. He brought
a passionate vision of America to his
politics but nothing as precise as John-
son’s Great Society which, whatever
else it means, clearly means abundance
(i.e., a high growth rate), peace (through
military strength) and freedom
(especially civil rights). “I believe in
these things,” said Johnson irresistibly,
“and so do you.” What did Goldwater
believe in —in practical politics?
Thirdly, Goldwater’s ideology was
little more than an indignant response
to the way freedom of choice was being
limited by welfare capitalism and civil
rights legislation at home and by the
balance of terror abroad. He repre-
sented not a new conservation but a
nostalgic yearning for the frontier values
of the Goldwater ancestors who, in the
early wave of Jewish pioneers of the
American West, had opened up Arizona.
HThe point could be underlined by
reference to Vietnam where Presi-
dent Johnson’s policy shows how plain
silly was Goldwater’s criticism of the
Democrats as appeasers—or by reference
to civil rights, the subject of Silberman’s
“Crisis in Black and White”, un-
doubtedly the best book yet on civil
rights. Silberman starts from what he
considers the unpalatable fact that there
is some truth in the hideous Sambo
stereotype of the American Negro.
Negroes, he says, are less ambitious than
whites, do have “looser morals”, their
crime rate is substantially higher, they do
“care less for the family”, their IQ
scores are lower, and their children do
poorer work in school. This is the prob-
lem and civil rights legislation alone will
not solve it. It is the result of American
history, which in relation to Negro
slavery is best illuminated to the Nazi
concentration camps that produced so
many white Sambos.
About four centuries ago, Negroes
from complex, often Muslim, tribes of
what is now Nigeria, Togo and Ghana,
were sold by their tribal leaders to white
slavers and transported to Protestant
colonies where their customs, religions,
rights, languages, families, names were
eradicated. They have today still not
overcome this terrible degradation.
It is instructive to compare the Ameri-
can slaves with those in South America.
Catholic Spain and Portugal maintained
the Roman law which recognised
Spiderman

Many filaments
To fellow-men, to
Other places, things—
I try to see. I
Touch, taste, spider-like,

Feed me. What buzzes,
Struggles in the web?

And blood? I run out

slavery as an unfortunate accident that
might happen to anyone, to any free
man. The slave kept many of his rights
of property, religion, marriage, edu-
cation, contracts, and the right, ulti-
mately, to become free again. Tribal
customs from specific parts of West
Africa can be recognised centuries later
in Brazil, and in the 17th century there
were famous Negro soldiers, in the 18th,
Negro bishops, in the 19th, professional
men of all kinds. But in the American
colonies, English common law did not
recognise slavery; legally it simply
could not exist and dealings with slaves
were invalid. The colonists solved the
problem by classifying slaves as animals
and treating them accordingly. The
Negro was totally brutalised, and no
race was less prepared for the freedom
which it did not win but which was given
to it after the Civil War. What is needed,
according to Silberman, is a massive
politics of repair not only by con-
ceeding civil rights but by building a
sense of identity (with Africa and
America) and a sense of power (in
politics), by rehabilitating of the family
by education and job training.
To lay the ghost of Sambo, Silberman
argues, it is no use breaking up neigh-
borhoods by bussing Negro children to
white schools in other districts —which
simply reminds the Negro children their
schools are inferior. The first step is
make all Negro schools good. Going
further yack, it is idle to talk of “starting
with the children”, if it means leaving
home life marked by shiftlessness,
crime, immorality unchanged. One
should rather “start with the parents”,
with a programme of family rehabili-
tation and job-training which means
subsidising Negro employees since it
would be no help to discriminate against
better-trained whites in recruiting employ-
ees.
Silberman emphasises a long, system-
atic haul because the problem is centuries
deep. The point, getting back to 1964,
'is that Goldwater, while genuinely
opposed to segregation, had nothing to
offer beyond saying that it was a problem
for the States, not for Washington, and
that he believed in freedom for all. The
result was that he won Mississippi and
Alabama! Johnson was committed to at
least something like Silberman’s politics
of repair.
The lesson of 1964 would seem to
be that the authentic conservatism in
America is represented more by Presi-
dent Johnson than by the alliance un-
intended by Goldwater of nostalgic
individualists, doctrinaire intellectuals,
and reactionary segregationalists.
The Demons of Balzac
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Prometheus: The Life Of Balzac. Andre
Maurois. Bodley Head. $5.30
Tn France the Balzac literary industry
* almost rivals Bardology in England.
More books have been written about the
author of the “Comedie Humaine” than
about any other French writer. There
have been whole volumes on Balzac’s
economic ideas, his religion, philosophy,
relations with society, relations with
women —to say nothing of the flood of
biographies and critical estimates of his
place in the French literary pantheon.
Andre Maurois, an old and practised
hand at popular biography, has done a
masterly job in skimming the cream off
this bottomless well of information. This
translation of his life of Balzac is, I
think, the best balanced and most in-
formative book on the subject that has yet
appeared in English.
Balzac was the annalist of the most
grossly materialist era in French history.
(One remembers Guizot’s famous advice
to his countrymen: “Never mind about
politics. Enrich yourselves!”) Infant
capitalism had its romantics in England
too; their most disarming productions
were those aquatints of ruddy furnaces
and black chimneys belching over the
misty Midland valleys. But it was money,
or rather the power of money, that fas-
cinated Balzac, and Paris, the capital of
the money-changers, the speculators,
bankers and swindlers, rather than the
mills and factories.
And what a world it is! Sometimes, to
purloin Rupert Brooke’s description of
the plays of Webster, the reader feels as
though he is peering at the feverish
turmoil of a nest of maggots. Most of the
characters, even the most sympathetically
observes, are driven by some single dem-
oniacal force —Gobseck by his avarice,
Birotteau by his craze for speculation,
Raphael de Valentin by his lust for
pleasure, old Goriot, as great a fool as
Lear but less human, by his doting
paternal affection. Men, in one of Bal-
zac’s own phrases, are killed by an idea
as surely as by a pistol shot. There is
not much of the sunshine of human ex-
istence in Balzac. With all his gusto, his
womanising, his extravagances and
Rabelaisian antics, Balzac was a profound
pessimist. His humor is sardonic when it
is not savage. His society was a jungle of
pitiless self-seeking in which the weak
were trampled down and the strong only
deluded to destruction by their ruling
passions. Occasionally Balzac revolted
against the world he portrayed with such
scarifying energy. “Oh to live the life of
a Mohican!” he cried after reading
Fenimore Cooper. It was a cry from the
heart of sophisticated Europe, a heart
bowed down by the weight of its money,
its culture, its history and its flaring gas
lamps. But probably it was, after all, a
piece of romantic bravura rather than a
genuine cri de coeur. Balzac would have
perished of boredom in the woods of
Connecticut.
Balzac’s faults are glaring and obvious;
so obvious that they have blinded some
critics, contemporary and recent, to his
extraordinary achievement. Throughout
his life he wrote with the devils of debts
and publishers’ deadlines at his back.
Fame brought money, but money poured
through his hands like water. The chroni-

cler of the grasping bourgeoisie slept in
a satin bed and evolved fantastic schemes
for making a fortune by growing pine-
apples or exploiting the ancient Roman
silver mines of Sardinia. Once on the
treadmill he could never get off. Often
he was writing two or three novels
simultaneously, working eighteen hours
a day with pot of black coffee at his
elbow. At the height of his reputation he
had to churn out “Cousin Bette”, one of
his masterpieces, in seven weeks. He
could be as wearisomely prolix as the
sorriest hack and as vulgar as his rival
in serialisation, Eugene Sue. But Saint-
Beuve merely exposed his limitations as a
critic when he contemptuously dismissed
the “Comedie Humaine” as “commercial
literature”. Beaudelaire castigated “the fat
child bulging with genius and vanity” for
his hasty, slapdash style, but he paid gen-
erous tribute to his magical story-telling.
Andre Maurois, however, is more con-
cerned with Balzac the man than with
literary judgments, and Balzac’s own
life rivalled any tale he ever told. “I have
two passions, love and fame,” he de-
clared, and he satisfied them both at a
price as deadly as that paid by Raphael in
“The Wild Ass’s Skin”. Like Rastignac
he looked down on Paris from the
heights of Pere-Lachaise and swore to
conquer it. He was an ugly little man with
flabby cheeks and broken teeth, improv-
ident, boastful and crude in speech and
manners. But women were fascinated by
him and they opened the doors into every
stratum of society he wanted to explore.
Considering the headlong pace at which
he lived and worked it is astonishing that
he reached the age of fifty-one.
One Thin Irishman
By LEONIE KRAMER
Collected Letters, 1874-1897: Bernard
Shaw. Edited by Dan H. Laurence. Max
Reinhardt. $7.35.
In recent months critics have told us
that George Bernard Shaw is enjoy-
ing a revival. This news came as a sur-
prise to me, because I had not thought
of him as dead. So it is reassuring, to
say the least of it, to find him so
vigorously asserting his vitality in his
letters. Not that I would argue that Shaw
is immune to the somewhat arbitrary
dictates of literary fashion. Literary
history is littered with premature burials
and belated resurrections (and vice
versa), but it was surely a more than
usual capricious change of opinion which
declared him defunct while “My Fair
Lady” was still sounding triumphantly
from *he stage.
This is the first in a series of four
volumes which will contain in all some
2500 letters covering 77 years of his life.
To judge from this sample, the editorial
work is excellent. Full but succinct notes
supply all the information a reader might
require, yet they are neither obtrusive
nor distracting. The letters in this first
volume date from the time when Shaw
was still living in Dublin, to the year
before his marriage. And what extra-
ordinary years they were! Here is Shaw
as unsuccessful novelist, as dramatist,
as music critic, as tireless lecturer on
Fabian socialism, and as.equally tireless
hunter of women (though he always
managed to persuade himself that they
were hunting him).
Shaw is the dramatist even in his per-
sonal letters. No matter to whom they
are addressed, they are always dramatisa-
tions of his own personality, as nicely
calculated in their effect upon their
audience as any of his stage tricks. He
casts himself as critic, as distracted lover
snared by the conflicting demands of his
women, as defender of the rights of man,
and as clown. But always he is his own
hero, and behind the individual recipient
of each letter one senses the wider
audience to whom, like his plays, pre-
faces and essays, they were undoubtedly
addressed.
It did not take Shaw long to realise
that for a man of his ambitions all that
mattered was one’s audience, and that a
certain way of capturing and holding it
was by cultivating an outrageous per-
sonality. It follows that in his private
correspondence (it is private only in
name, hardly in intention) he shows him-
self to be vain, arrogant, demanding and
infuriating. He lectures Florence Farr
on genius, finding himself to be a genius
"°f the first order”, “produced by the
breed throwing forward to the godlike
man”. He declares her to be an idiot,
and condemns her “to talk instead of
listening”.
In this way, he supposes, he, “being
the greater intelligence”, might possibly
learn something from her. He lectures
Ellen Terry on acting: “You would not
stick five bars rest into a Beethoven
symphony to pick up your drumsticks;
and similarly you must not stop the
Shakespeare orchestra for business.” And
in a very different tone he lectures Julian
Sturgis, the librettist whom he had
described as “a journeyman hired for the
job , on the kind of language required
by a composer. For Janet Achurch he
has words on diction: “When I saw ‘Doll’s
House’ for the second time at Islington,
you inflicted such torments on me with
every syllable you uttered that my affec-
tion for you finally came out by the roots.
I really cannot love a woman with a saw-
mill at each corner of her mouth.”
Here, of course, is the legendary Shaw
—hard-hitting, no respecter of persons,
maddening in his confident assumption
of superiority and rightness. The sheer
provocativeness of his writing guarantees
the interest of every letter. Even the
most trivial is not without some point
which forces one into a silent debate with
its author. Yet to seize upon this as
the only, or even dominant, aspect of the
letters is to misrepresent Shaw. There
are stronger and more abiding elements
in his personality than his surface bril-
liance —his intensity and seriousness as
a dramatist, especially perhaps in his first
plays, his perfectionism, his genuine (and

BUL
advanced) social conscience, his ability
to see and cut through the hypocrisies of
the social order. Nor is his sense of
humor and his sharp wit always turned
away from himself. He can describe him-
self falling off his bicycle with all the
zest of a man writing a scene for a farce,
and the theatricality of his description
in the later letters of his pursuit of
Charlotte Payne-Townshend is to his dis-
advantage rather than hers.
More important still for a just assess-
ment of the man is his recognition of
greatness, and his refusal to be distracted
by fashionable preferences in art. Though
he talked incessantly about his own
genius, he not only acknowledged the
genius of others, but understood what
he meant by it. His championship of
Wagner in the face of an unreceptive
English public, and his appreciation of
Ibsen, are evidence enough of this.
(Though it is difficult to excuse his
judgment of Brahms, who, like Tenny-
son, was “an extraordinary musician,
with the brains of a third-rate village
policeman”.) As a creative writer himself,
he had a strong sense of the critic’s
responsibility a sense not always
shared by those whose only business is
criticism. “The critic’s first duty,” he
writes, “is to admit, with absolute respect,
the right of every man to his own style
. . . There is always a vulgar cry both
for and against every man or woman of
distinction; and from such cries you can-
not keep your mind too clear if you wish
to attain distinction yourself.”
In a word, the popular view of Shaw
the icpnoclast is much too simple for so
complex a personality. He is no mere
image - breaker, nor flashy comedian.
Much of his criticism, theatrical and
otherwise, stems from conviction, and
at least some of his vanity is proper
pride. Though even in his letters he
seems to stand upon the public stage,
there is wisdom as well as wit to be
found in them. Behind the glitter of w'it,
the sharpness of intelligence, the agile
arguments, the opinionated pronounce-
ments, the dictatorial gestures, there are
penetrating insights on many subjects.
Above all there is a conviction of the
importance of the arts, and of the main-
tenance of the highest standards of per-
formance in them. He may himself not
have possessed the very highest qualities
of genius —in spite of his famous
declaration he is after all not better than
Shakespeare. But he had what is very
nearly as important, the power to recog-
nise and acknowledge them in others. To
Robert Buchanan he wrote: “The in-
evitable does not touch me; it is the non-
avoidance of the evitable, the neglect of
the possible, the falling short of attain-
able efficiency, clearness, accuracy and
beauty, that set me raging. I really care
deeply for nothing but fine work, and
since nobody can help me in this, no less
can greatly affect my self-sufficiency.” If
in these words he defines his own limita-
tions, he at the same time justifies many
of his attitudes. Does Shaw really need
to be pronounced alive again by the
critics? How he would revel in the idea!
“Do you suppose,” he would say, as he
wrote to Ellen Terry complaining about
the possible postponement of one of his
plays, “I will let you treat me like Shake-
speare—play me centuries after I am
dead?”

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Getting in on the Act
rFHERE is no point in ignoring the controversial new British Companies Bill; the
A same sort of legislation can happen here and there is a fair chance it will.
Something like it is aiready in the air,
as Mr Jay’s Bill is soon to be closely
examined by the standing committee of
State Government officials who are at
present investigating possible amend-
ments to the 1961 uniform Companies
Acts in Australia. There seems little
doubt that many of the significant
clauses in the British Bill will be in-
corporated in the Australian Acts and
a fair chance that some of the Jenkins
Committee recommendations left out of
the British Act may also appear locally.
Already the State Attorneys-General
have asked for the opinions of account-
ants, lawyers and stock exchanges on
the Jenkins Report and the standing com-
mittee has been considering these for
some time. But the transfer of so many
of the Jenkins theories into practice by
the British Bill will no doubt be a spur
to local action.
There is no doubt that action is
needed. Despite the striking improve-
ments in recent years (particularly in
the amount of information disclosed to
shareholders) that have followed both
legislative and stock exchange action,
there is still too much scope for company
directors to do the wrong thing and
still too many of them actually doing it.
The British Bill would go some of the
way, at least, to limiting that scope.
The most radical provision of the UK
Bill is to require the accounts of all
limited liability companies, private or
public, to be publicly filed. Even in the
US, where company disclosure is prob-
ably greatest, the private company enjoys
more privacy than the listed. Still, there
is some justice in the British view that
a company which is given the benefits of
limited liability should be required to
show the world, and its customers in
particular, what sort of risks they are
running in doing business with it.
One of the more far-reaching clauses
(which will be of greatest benefit
to investment analysis) is that requiring
turnover to be revealed and, where
sections of the business differ sub-
stantially in kind from one another, a
breakdown of sales and profits in all
these different branches of operations.
Not too many Australian companies care
to volunteer their turnover, though why
this should be of greater value to com-
petitors than ultimate profit is hard to
see. Few already volunteer the pro-
portion of sales or profits in each major
activity.
The UK requirement that the true
value of a company’s trade investments
be revealed, and the naming of those
where holdings represent more than 10
p.c. of capital or where they contribute
10 p.c. or more of the investing com-
pany’s profits, cover broadly the UK
stock exchange measures, but goes well
beyond Australian law or practice. Our
Act requires separation of investments in
the accounts into Government, municipal
and other public debentures, stock or
bonds; investments in subsidiaries; invest-
ments in listed shares or debentures of
non-subsidiaries; and investment in other
companies, stating “the method used to
arrive at the amount under each heading”.
There are many who say the British
Bill goes too far, but there are many who
complain it does not go far enough.
Three pertinent criticisms from Mr
Nicholas Davenport, the sage commen-
tator in “The Spectator”, are that the
Bill does nothing to make nominees
declare their beneficial owners, to make
insiders declare their minority or
majority holdings, nor to make com-
panies reveal their contributions to
charities in the same way as it forces
revelation of their political contributions.
“This kind of largesse can be just as
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy : Another cocoon of protec-
tion has been spun around the motor vehicle industry
by the Federal Government’s acceptance of a Tariff
Board proposal to impose an extra 10 p.c. duty on
imported assembled cars and station wagons in any
two-year span when these imports exceed p.c. of
total new registrations; observers differ on the effect
this will have on the popular and cheaper Japanese
models . . . January’s unemployment statistics showed
a slight, though far from dangerous, drift with un-
employed registrants rising by 4300 and vacant jobs
falling by 2400—registrants being at their highest and
vacancies at their lowest for two years . . . Wool sold
at auction during the seven months to January 31
brought in 9 p.c. less than in the corresponding period
of 1964-65; the drought meant fewer bales sold and
affected quality . . . Trading bank liquidity rose in
January, even after a small rise in advances (mostly
to farmers) . . . Private overseas investment in com-
panies in Australia (capital inflow) totalled $516 million
for 1964-65, against the previous year’s $414 million.
For the markets' A good measure of pre-
decimalisation euphoria fled from Australian share
markets last week and they gave the impression, too,
of having passed the usual new year bounce. Most
industrials, including the leaders, lacked lustre, while
mining issues, especially base metals, were examined
with great care. There is still, among metals, some
shine on the beach sands . . . London gives every
appearance of imperviousness to poor economic news
the index’s forward creep could not be halted by
bad January trade figures and rather doubtful behavior
by sterling. Once again, scrip shortage is a decisive
factor, especially as a group of new unit trusts chase
equities . . . Rather in contrast with London, dealings
on Wall Street look erratic, for investors are really
trying to digest various interpretations of the economy’s
future. Officialdom harps on expansion (including war
demands) without inflation; some non-Administration
economists begin to doubt this kind of reasoning. The
index see-saws on high volumes.
For Companies .* A steady reiteration of in-
creasing costs came from many company chairmen
last week . . . Perhaps the most distinguished example
was furnished by ICIANZ’s full 1964-65 report: profit
has plainly lagged behind rising group sales: However,
there’s no retarding expansion: projects authorised and
proceeding total $72 million . . . Conditions in the
motor trade brought lower results for both Repco
fhalf year) and Borg-Warner (full year), though divi-
dends were held and Repco in particular hopes to
equal 1964-65’s record profit over the whole of 1965-66

spending and Woolworths had to be content with a

wicked, for it is not uncommon for a
director to persuade his company to con-
tribute to causes from which he per-
sonally gains prestige or gains face.” Or,
it could be added, an occasional honor.
The fact remains that Britain, like the
rest of Europe, is moving a long way in
improving its company legislation. France
and Germany have recently introduced
strict new regulations; Italy has some on
the way; Belgium and the Netherlands
are at present looking into the matter.
Even the better Swiss companies are
following the trend to more disclosure,
though there is no compulsion (nor any
likely) in Switzerland.
So the shoutings of finance journalists
and the nagging of stock exchange
authorities cannot really be dismissed by
Australian company managements as the
noisy irrelevancies of an unimportant
nuisance group. The world-wide trend
is to more disclosure.
Going on Super
rPHE coming of the superannuated man
has meant a striking change in the
life assurance business. The life offices
are breaking their necks to get into t’;e
employee superannuation business that
has suddenly blossomed with the spread
of the welfare State (encouraged by
legislation) into the factory.
Figures for the latest five months
issued by the Commonwealth Statis-
tician show that the amount of super-
annuation business done by the life
offices has jumped by a further 18 per
cent, following the previous year’s
strong rise. This has been largely at the
cost of normal life assurance business,
as people who are being asked to join
voluntary superannuation schemes are
often deciding against taking up an
ordinary life policy and in many
cases are cancelling those already held.
The latest figures show that not only
has the rate of increase in new business
done on ordinary life policies dropped
sharply to only 7 p.c., but there was
also a sharp 14 p.c. rise in the value of
discontinued policies from the same
period in the previous year.
Sales “representatives” of the big
offices say that they have been under
instructions to go after the super-
annuation business for all they are
worth for the last couple of years. But
they say that much of the recent in-
creases in this field are once-and-for-all
and that in a few years the industry will
settle down to a normal growth rate
over all its fields.
Equity Oysters
YMhen Mr Holt speaks of Australia
having a big equity stake in over-
seas-owned companies operating here he
is not on the same wave as local investors.
It is true, as he implied in Queensland
last week, that overseas-owned companies
work just over two-fifths of their time for
the Government, since nearly 43 cents
out of every one dollar profit made here
smaller advance in its latest profit than for the previous
year; earning rate, though, was practically held . . .
British Tobacco, however, was in no way restrained:
a peak profit at $6,978,682 was achieved by a 24.5 p.c.
jump, suggesting also that the bevy of food and drink
diversifications has contributed handsomely . . . Henry
Jones will be forced “to expend a substantial sum . . .
on plant and machinery” to contain costs, but is thank-
ful that past diversification “has enabled the con-
tinuance of the regular dividend” . . . The ES&A Bank
does not expect its current year’s profit to rise because
of “exceptional” expenses involved in the decimal
changeover . . . Fertilizer optimism was a trifle dashed
by Australian Fertilizers, which sees reduced demand
from drought-stricken northern NSW . . . That situation
also dragged woolbroker Winchombe Carson’s profit
back and interim dividend was kept at last year’s lower
3 p.c. rate . . . Amalgamated Chemicals duly received
Continental Oil’s bid of $1.20 a 50c share for 65 p.c.
of its capital. Will Dow lift its $l.lO a share offer?
Directors favor Continental, ambiguously; the share
market, though active, stays cautious . . . Dunlop
Rubber, following a disappointing 1964-65 result, is
to raise $l4 million in unsecured notes . . . International
Harvester has formed a finance subsidiary and is
expected to seek $6 million in debentures . . . Positive
profit gains were made by James Stedman, A. G. Sims,
Wynyard Holdings and Mutual Acceptance.

by overseas investors goes in taxation.
There’s certainly no harm, and prob-
ably a lot of good, in looking at overseas
investment in this way. But why Mr
Holt raised the hare of Australian parti-
cipation in the Dawson by-election fight
is a bit of a mystery.
The familiar, oddly-assorted chorus of
Labor politicians, institutional investors
and leading stockbrokers advocating legis-
lation to oblige overseas-owned com-
panies to share their equity capital with
local (40 p.c. was once suggested by Mr
Staniforth Ricketson; though some of
the politicians would like it higher) has
been remarkably quiet lately.
Labor politicians are probably too busy
at the moment with domestic quarrels
to give the subject much thought. None
of them appears to have noticed that the
record rate of capital inflow in recent
months makes it more obvious than
ever that overseas participation in Aus-
tralian industry is growing apace.
When he was Treasurer, Mr Holt
wielded the big stick over institutional
investors by making them captive sub-
scribers to Government loans. Even if
only as a quid pro quo for this dis-
criminatory treatment, it wouldn’t be too
much to ask the Government to have
another look, as Canada has done, at the
question of opening the equity oysters
of foreign companies for Australian in-
vestors.
For this relief . . .
withdrawal, however slight,
from its London Metal Exchange
peak at £stg7oo a ton must have
occasioned some relief among producers,
as well as among the LME’s rather
harassed marginal buyers. Not that the
producers, staunchly attempting to hold
their world price at £336 a ton, can’t be
described as harassed, too. To the
multiplicity of problems they have faced
during the last year or so has to be
added a considerable resurgence of sub-
stitutes, particularly aluminium. This
substitute appeal has certainly not been
missing within Australia.
Chilean labor stoppages, of course,
have almost become epidemic lately and
were the main cause of the recent US-
embargo even on forward scrap exports.
Some honoring of these forward con-
tracts is now permissible.
The latest fear to hit producers is that
a breakdown of trade between Zambia
and Rhodesia could mean no supplies
of Rhodesian coal for the Zambian mines
and a cutting of Zambia’s rail link
through Rhodesia Some London
observers still seem very cheerful, per-
haps too cheerful, about this situation.
Any immediate drop in world prices
depends largely on the Rhodesian out-
come.

The Treasury’s Cosy Chat
“Everything will be all right”
By CROESUS
TSTE’RE a bit tired of politicians speaking to civil service briefs on subjects they
” know precious little about. So it tickled us somewhat to see Mr Lindsay Brand
of the Treasury, the top official in the decimal currency play, popping up on TV at
a Press conference and talking about newsboys slightly short of cents on the opening
day of doing business in dollars.
We like to think of our Treasury men
being human, as indeed they are. If we
could drink with them in their Canberra
clubs, we’d probably find they get into
their cups too, like the rest of us. Mostly,
though, we visualise them as sinister
ogres at the receiving end of our tax
returns and one often feels that, like
opposing solicitors, their set teeth bely
their natures and their inclinations.
How pleasant, then, that Treasury
worms allow themselves to turn towards
us occasionally, opening their hearts as
earthy pragmatists, discussing this and
that in polemical vein. Thus, for the
financial journalists at any rate, life is
enriched.
There is not only Mr Brand. There is
. somebody in the Treasury, and we have
a good idea who he is, who has come to
entertain us with delightful effusions
which see the light of day in the aweful
and most anonymous titles of supple-
ments to Treasury Information Bulletins.
The latest of these, as you will know, is
on the balance of payments; it is a sort
of follow-up to another one flung into
the same stream last May on private
overseas investment.
Here is a Treasury official really letting
his hair down and, without naming any
names (like Wheelwright or Vernon, for
instance), taking up his pen for the
Treasury as anybody else might seize a
sword to slay overbearing outside mon-
sters, academic and otherwise, who dare
challenge the Treasury’s prerogative to
defend and guide the course of things
at the nation’s economic citadel.
Talk about flying in the face of the
enemy. Here is this winsome writer talk-
ing in the name of the Crown as if he
were the Queen’s personal jester, imply-
ing it is really too funny that “you know
who” thought it could convince anybody
that the Australian balance of payments
would be in a state of ruins in 1975,
wrecked by an avalanche of overseas
remittances on the torrent of capital in-
flow we’ve been receiving these many
years and no more voluminously nor
helpfully than in the last six months or
so.
The entry of this Treasury bulletineer
into the lists on the capital inflow
argument is timed perfectly—not only
because we have never had so much
capital inflow in any six months as we’ve
had in the last half of 1965 but also
because only last week GMH told us
we’d been stung for a dividend remit-
tance to the United States of $2 million
more for 1965 than for the previous year,
despite the company having dropped $l2
million in profits in the latest year.
Some people will take the arguments
advanced with a grain of salt, if only
because they are largely an apologia for
the Treasury’s confessed inability to draw
up a balance of payments forecast for,
say, ten years ahead, as the Vernon
Committee bravely attempted to do and
got so many slaps in the face for its
efforts.
It could be that, when he was
Treasurer, Mr Holt often felt rather
lonely when espousing the case for un-
restricted capital inflow to fellow Aus-
tralians without more convincing am-
munition being supplied by his officials
on where this policy might eventually
lead us. His officials probably told him
they didn’t know the long-term answers
and that he need not worry about them,
anyway, because we live in an uncertain
world where anything can happen to
make a-laughing stock of long-term fore-
casters, official or otherwise. And they
probably reminded him that in the last
resort the politicians have to take the
blame.
At any rate we now know from our
bulletineer that the Treasury officials
don’t know the answers and that in his
view nobody can possibly know them.
For the Treasury, we learned last year,
“projection” is a dirty word. With that
costly computer up there one might have
imagined that a few series of figures
could have been shovelled in on this
subject. For instance, figures asking the
computer to tell us what would be the
amount we would have to pay to over-
seas investors given a number of possi-
bilities as to the amount of capital which
would flow in during the next ten years
(say); the possible rates of return that
might be expected to be a charge on
the balance of payments in 1975, and so
on. Possibly the Treasury has worked
out a range of answers but it is keeping
mighty quiet about them.
Stopping short of the idea that they
could well tell economic journalists more
about their statistical findings in con-
fidence as background information (but
who ever heard of the Treasury holding
a Press conference —here's Mr Mc-
Mahon’s chance for a bit more Treasury
humanisation), perhaps the bulletineer,
or a more mathematically minded col-
league, could extend his field by writing
up the Treasury’s own projection story
(if there is one) on the balance of pay-
ments in the Economic Record (what
about it, Professor Downing?). Until
we see something tangible from the

Treasury on this, one can only recom-
mend the veneration of the Vernon
efforts, even if the assumptions don’t
please everybody; a few arithmetical
corrections must be made and the whole
thing is probably just a game of dice.
In the meantime, the Treasury leaves
us to sit back in comfort with the cosiest
of arguments on the beneficence of capital
inflow for our economic weat at home,
and even for our solace when looking
over the fence to our external payments.
It says, in effect, that everything will be
all right if we keep the economy flexible.
“There is not in our economic situation
anything to suggest a continuing long-
term state of external imbalance.” In
its view the only niggers in the woodpile
are not economically branded —“factors
not of economic origin could alter the
prospects radically”.
It is all summed up magnificently in
what must be the most complacent-ever
utterance from an Australian Govern-
merit department, viz: “A compounding
sum of income payable abroad will not,
contrary to a common view on this topic,
in itself necessarily prove onerous. The
rise in outgoings is but one side of the
equation and it is quite wrong to con-
sider that rise while positing no change
in the other side. That other side in-
cludes the impact of overseas investment
on productivity, on imports and on ex-
ports, These are as much the continu-
ing and increasing results of overseas
capital inflow as the service charges on
that inflow. While the one may appear
a more tangible prospect than the other,
and thus cause unease, it must be re-
membered that overseas capital need not
move directly into export or import-
replacing industries (though in many
cases it does) to have a beneficial effect
on the balance of payments. It is essen-
tial to grasp this point”.
Tt goes on: “As a corollary it is well to
remember that if we postulate a very
large increase in income payable over-
seas we are implicitly postulating a very
large increase in overseas capital in Aus-
tralia (sic). When the great impact of
overseas capital on the economy to date
is observed, it is impossible to contem-
plate such a development not also having
marked effects on the economy. This
would be particularly true, if, as in the
past, such an inflow of overseas capital
were regarded as complementary to an
equally large increase in population
through immigration.”
It is not to be said, however, the
bulletin concludes, “that action related
to the balance of payments is never re-
quired, or that it can be left until the
last moment. On the contrary, at any
point of time there may well be grounds
for action designed, for example, to
strengthen the basic infrastructure of the
economy in those areas in which, so far
as can be seen, the prospects for the
growth of exports in the medium-term
seem brightest: for action of this kind
does take some years to plan and with-
out it the future growth in production
of exports could be impeded. What is
suggested is that, the short-run aside,
the long-term future of the balance of
payments is best safeguarded, apart from
particular action of this kind, by work-
ing towards a flexible economy in which
resources can flow to their most produc-
tive uses, and in which, as a result,
producers can respond quickly and
effectively to the new and changing
opportunities that will rise”.
Granted there is pleasing open-minded-
ness in all this, as indeed there is
throughout the 59-page survey. But
surely it is time for the Treasury to get
off its academic pedestal and match some
figures with the Vernonites.


New Computer Link for Trendex
Through the co-operation of the Sydney Stock Exchange authorities,
Trendex is now using the Exchange’s big IBM 1460 computer to cover
new ground in its market timing methods. The Trendex buying and sell-
ing signals, which have been pointing out tops and bottoms in the prices
of some important stocks in recent years, can be extended considerably
Choosing Stocks
Trendex & Co Pty Ltd are port-
folio managers. Company reports
and earning capacity are analysed
to select suitable stocks. However,
Trendex advises investment in a
stock only if its price is more likely
to rise than to fall. No stock is a
good investment at a time when a
price decline is probable. For every
company—whether a leader or not
—there is a right time to buy and a
right time to sell. It is better to have
the wrong stock at the right time
than the right stock at the wrong
time.
Timing Methods
Trendex has been developing its
market timing techniques for more
than 10 years. In 1961 “Trendex”
was first published, to bring the
methods to the notice of discerning
investors. No other organization in
Australia had used such timing
methods, or knew of their useful-
ness.
Trendex has created an aware-
ness of the great importance of
market timing. Some institutions
and more progressive broking
houses are now starting to use the
methods.
Some of the Trendex market tim-
ing techniques originated overseas,
and have been used by sophisticated
investors in the United States for
many years. They are fully describ-
ed in the book “Forecasting Aus-
tralian Stock Prices With Trendex”.
Some important timing methods
have been specially developed by
Trendex for use under Australian
conditions.
Inside Knowledge
Every observant investor knows
that stock price is influenced only
in a general way by company merit.
Price movements are dictated by
the interaction of buying power and
selling pressure. Big price changes
can be caused by the buying or sell-
ing activity of astute people who
know or guess, well in advance,
what will happen to the earnings,
dividend rate, or control of a com-
pany. These people make real
money.
Trendex measures buying power
and selling pressure, and detects
the influence of astute or informed
buying and selling. This is translat-
ed into buying and selling signals—
in time to act.
Many of the market timing tech-
niques are simple to use. Because
they are fully explained in Trendex,
subscribers throughout Australia
are applying them for themselves,
with excellent results. The methods
are now becoming accepted. Some
knowledge of them has been recog-
nised as a need by the Sydney Stock
Exchange, which now includes it as
part of the training course for Stock
Exchange personnel.
New Selling Signals
The more specialized timing sig-
nals being developed by Trendex in-
volve a tremendous amount of
statistical research. The Phi signal,
which successfully pointed out the
“top” in such stocks as Dunlop,
C.S.R., Ampol, 8.H.P., G. J. Coles,
C.A.G.A., Custom Credit, John Fair-
fax, National Consolidated, Rocla,
and H. C. Sleigh, was developed by
laborious calculations over a period
of years. Up to 11 people were en-
gaged part time on the work.
Two more timing signals show
promise of being just as successful
in picking market tops and bottoms,
but the testing has been slow. The
Sydney Stock Exchange computer
is now doing statistical work for
Trendex on contract, and will great-
ly speed up the studies. The signals
will be used as additional tools in
portfolio management by Trendex
& Co. Outstanding examples also
will appear in Trendex itself.
Each week the computer produces
for Trendex about 200 large sheets
of statistics, arising from over one
million calculations based on Stock
Exchange data. Moreover the Tren-
dex staff can now push on with new
valuable research work, and improve
still further the qiiality of the Tren-
dex service to clients.

By-election
Anyone for developing
By MICHAEL
REX PATTERSON
For Labor Party
irony of next Saturday's Dawson
-*■ by-election is that despite the valiant
efforts of the Labor candidate, Dr Rex
Patterson, the real issue will not be
northern development. Instead it will
probably be decided on the tawdry ques-
tion of which band of political oppoi-
tunists should lead what remains of the
Australian Labor Party.
It is almost as if the staggeringly im-
portant question of what should we do
with the northern part of Australia were
too significant to be decided in a small
country electorate in Queensland. It is
certainly unreal that the two socialist
parties in the Federal Parliament the
ALP and the Country Party should
be pretending to disagree at Dawson
about whether or not the Government
should spend more money on the north.
But let there be no doubt about the
fact that there is disagreement about the
north; that the issue is a serious one con-
cerning every Australian but gives few
any real concern. The economics that
lie behind the Dawson by-election (and
which will be all but submerged by the
vulgar political considerations that the
ALP has once again raised lemming-like
in an eager effort to destroy itself) are
worthy of discussion. And not simply
academic discussion, or the back-slap-
ping reassuring repetitious rituals that
disciples of the development cult go
through at such pseudo-academic
gatherings as last week’s symposium at
the University of NSW complete with
a tame devil's disciple who was allowed
to blaspheme for a strict 20 minutes
while the leader of the northern develop-
ment push, Labor’s Dawson candidate,
was given twice that time to spread the
word.
The issue of northern development,
over which the Dawson by-election
should be fought, is the sort of thing
that is ideal for the hustings. It is one
on which a prejudiced position can be
readily rationalised from the volumes of
well tried argument used over recent
years. Emotionally charged, goodies-and-
baddies stuff, it presents everything in
black and white. Dr Rex Patterson is
Omo-white as Defender of the Faith;
Dr B. R. Davidson is quite unspeakable
as the leader of the forces of Darkness.
tTUtE whipping boy is, of course, the
A Federal Government, whose failure
to find some sort of coherent policy for
coping with the north is almost as
astounding as the ludicrous comment
from the Minister for National Develop-
ment, Mr D. E. Fairbairn, at last week’s
symposium, that the present Common-
wealth set-up for the north was “a suit-
able and adequate one”. The Govern-
ment appears to be hoping that out of
its untidy mess of ad hoc decisions to
assist various northern projects, some
policy may finally emerge. It has not
managed to so far. We stilt don’t know
whether the Government would prefer
the north to be developed to, say, the
Mallee.
And if Mr Fairbairn’s assurance that
the Government’s arrangements were
“adequate” referred to the 20-month-old
Northern Development Division of the
National Development Department, then
the Australian public should feel most
alarmed. Unless the situation in Can-
berra has changed materially since I
occupied a research position in the
Policy Division of that Department, the
prospects of its Northern Division actual-
ly achieving anything in policy terms
apart from drawing a few maps are
non-existent. The Department has been
treated as a joke by Treasury for years,
and most of its best people spend a
great deal of their time anxiously scan-
ning the lists of jobs going in the Trade
Department.
Nevertheless, the Government does
have a recognisable position on this sub-
ject. It is that northern development is
up to free enterprise, and that the pro-
per role for government is to assist pri-
vate enterprise by providing services
which would act as a catalyst to encour-
age that development, along with help-
ing create the “right climate” for it
through trade treaties, protection and
subsidies. This is the way things have
gone in the past, and it’s the way the
Government considers they should go in
the future.
This begs the question of what the
Government wants to happen in the
north what sort of “climate” it intends
to create. Does building an uneconomic
dam or two for sociological or strategic
reasons in the area come within the
scope of Mr Fairbairn’s climate cliche?
But why should the north be develop-
ed? What about the slamming attack on
the development myth by Dr Davidson?
And what is his line, anyway?
As he demonstrated at last week’s
symposium, Dr Davidson won’t have a
bar of the economic arguments in favor
of developing the north. He established
that no sound economic reason existed
for intensive agriculture in the northern
areas, and that extensive grazing was the
best thing for the north. He demolished
five Aunt Sallys he put up as representing
the main non-economic reasons advanced
for developing the north, too. These
were the need for tropical crops to
feed Asia, to save imports and help the
balance of payments, to get a large
population in the north for defence pur-
poses, to fill it up before the Asians do,
and to raise the standards of the
Aborigines.
"LTe says that Australia could produce
food, either for sale or as a gift to
Asia, far more cheaply in southern Aus-
tralia; that a 12 per cent expansion in
exports of wool, wheat and meat would
be equal in value to all the cotton, sugar,
rice and tobacco (all produced under
subsidies or other protections) consumed
locally; that there is nothing to prove a
populated north would be easier to de-

fend; that it was doubtful whether greater
development would benefit the Abo-
rigines.
Davidson’s attacks have certainly
dented the developers’ case, but they have
not destroyed it by any means. His line
is clearly too narrow, his attitudes too
determined by the slide rule to be useful
in a world where hardly any international
commodity trading is done at prices that
honestly represent supply and demand
forces. For Dr Davidson to attack a pro-
ject like cotton-growing in the north
only because the end product could not
compete on world markets not only
ignores the other considerations involved
in settling the area but also implies a
naive approach to world commodity
pricing.
Nevertheless, there seems far more
good sense in his suggestions about deve-
loping the grazing industry more effici-
ently than in many of Dr Patterson’s
visionary schemes.
Dr Patterson wants a big plan for
developing the whole north of Australia,
with the Government playing a major
role. He rejects the Davidson economic
analysis, pointing out the importance
of the secondary impact on the economy
of northern industries like sugar which
may look uneconomic on the surface be-
cause the protected high domestic price
in effect subsidises exports. Patterson
points to the profits Queensland rail-
ways make from this area, and the great
dependence of other industries on sugar
to provide a viable base for the economy
of the region. But Patterson does not
even discuss whether the investment that
went into the sugar industry, for example,
may have brought even greater second-
ary impact had it gone into another in-
dustry in the south.
Patterson defends the Ord and
Emerald rivers schemes, against Dr
Davidson's mathematical approach,
claiming that the value of lucerne and
cotton by-products is far greater than
simply their sale price to the farmer. “The
averted losses of breeding cattle and
calves in time of seasonal distress, to-
gether with the annual increment in beef
production on properties as a result of a
supplement being available during the
critical months of the year will provide
substantial benefits. In a similar manner,
external economies in - freights, power
costs, fertilisers and so on will be gene-
rated in the irrigation project itself as well
as in other industries.”
But everything here presupposes that
northern development is of itself a desir-
able aim the basis of Dr Patterson’s
faith. He thinks that there is scope for
greater activity by private enterprise
under present conditions, particularly
in mineral development and the utilisa-
tion of oil and natural gas, with govern-
ments providing technical assistance, ser-
vicing facilities and normal requisites
like communication and towns.
TTe wants the Government’s policy to
require local processing of minerals;
he wants more beef roads, he wants more
development of the brigalow country
through co-operative Government and
private investment programmes; he
wants “positive action on water conser-
vation” involving many dams and irri-
gation schemes that would counter
droughts; he wants more technical and
economic research and more training
facilities. In short, he wants a policy
which will cater for everything, includ-
ing questions like incentives to private
industry, such as concessions on income
and sales taxes, provision of satisfactory
development capital, and establishment
of a sound freight structure.
His plans could only be achieved by
“Government intervention through the
supply of funds” and other encourage-
ments, and he says that initial govern-
mental activity would generate more
development from private enterprise.
Patterson would also want this private
capital to come more from local sources,
while allowing that some foreign capital
and skills are needed.
But all the economic questions of
northern development—and the political
ones that spattered Mr Gough Whitlam’s
paper to the symposium last week and
are being tub-thumped around the
electorate now —will probably not count
for all that much on Saturday. And if
this is what happens when the former
head of the Northern Development
Division resigns and stands for Parlia-
ment, what chance has northern develop-
ment got as an Australia-wide election
issue later this year?

MAN ON THE LAND
How to Educate Farmers
Not only a duty of government
An the academic side of agriculture in
Australia there is a problem. What
is it?
To begin with we have the depressing
statistics that 1300 potential students have
been turned down by agricultural colleges
in Victoria and NSW this year. The two
Victorian agricultural colleges, Dookie
and Longerenong, received 840 applica-
tions for 140 vacancies. Both raised their
entrance qualifications this year and thus
eliminated many aspiring students. Yet
eight per cent of those who reached the
necessary standard still had to be rejected
because there was insufficient room.
In NSW there is a similar situation.
The NSW Minister for Agriculture, Mr
Chaffey, has been quoted as saying that
his Government is keenly aware of the
urgent need for extending agricultural
education facilities. Claims for the estab-
lishment of agricultural colleges in par-
ticular localities in NSW are being
investigated. Hawkesbury and Wagga
colleges received 600 applications for
only 120 vacancies; Yanco had 200
applications for 100 vacancies.
Mr Chalfey said that any increase in
agricultural education facilities would de-
pend on three things:
• Determination of the type of new
institution to be established, or the
degree of expansion in existing in-
stitutions.
• Availability of staff to cope with in-
creased enrolments.
• Availability of finance.
We must also wonder what would have
happened had all the 1300 rejected stu-
dents been accepted this year. On com-
pletion of their courses what would they
have done with themselves? What open-
ings are there for diplomates (and the
agricultural colleges grant diplomas and
not degrees)?
The plain facts seem to be that open-
ings for diplomates are not as readily
available as might be imagined and defi-
nitely do not pay as well as might be
imagined. Regardless of the disappoint-
ment felt by those rejected, it is just
possible that the outflow of diplomates is
about what the employment market can
satisfy. To be precise about this we
would need to know a statistic we do not
have, namely, the number of intending
students who, upon completion of their
courses, would return to their family
farms or begin farming themselves.
It may not be justice but it would be
practical to have many young farmers
given the benefit of a higher agricultural
education. A more selective process
might be warranted, in the practical sense,
to ensure a flow of graduates going into
extension and the ancillary side of agri-
culture.
Farmers’ sons, and young men with the
wherewithal to buy farms, do, of course,
go to agricultural colleges. Strangely,
they are almost non-existent in the still
higher strata of agricultural education
the universities. It is reasonable to
generalise on this and to state that the
university-trained agricultural scientists
go almost to a man into the various
State departments of agriculture, the
CSIRO, other government departments
(Federal and State), or to academic teach-
ing posts. Why this is so remains some-
thing of a mystery.
It is possible that few practical farmers
see the benefit of a higher agricultural
education. It is also possible that the
university degree courses are more closely
attuned to the requirements of the depart-
ments of agriculture than to agriculture
generally. It is an historical fact that the
universities created courses in agriculture
in Australia in close co-operation with
the departments.
The Australian situation is different
from that existing in the UK and USA,
where aspiring practical farmers, and
private practitioners, attend the univer-
sities in large numbers, along with those

destined for departmental careers. It
seems safe to say, however, that as the
private farm adviser gains ground in
Australia, a shift away from departmen-
tal influence over the university degree
courses in agriculture will be discerned.
Australia’s private farm advisers seem
here to stay. Some are doing extremely
well; others not so well. Much depends,
naturally, on the quality of the man him-
self, but more depends, possibly, on the
attitude of mind of his clients.
None of this really helps the 1300 boys
who wanted to take an agricultural college
course this year and who missed out. One
would hate to have to tell each of them
that it might have been for his own good.
It does seem wrong, in principle, that
agriculture generally has so little to offer
those who are unlucky enough not to be
born rich or sons of farmers.
Farmers themselves, in their organisa-
tions, will argue till the cows come home
over such matters as unity, wool reserve
prices, drought aid, and so on. One can-
not recall a serious discussion on the lack
of opportunity for youth in Australian
farming. Let’s not kid ourselves about
this. Boarding-houses in Sydney and Mel-
bourne are full of country boys who just
had to make the move to the big smoke.
Sir Samuel Wadham has got close to
this problem with his plea for courses for
the training of farm managers. But if little
seems to be happening it is only because
farmers themselves do not look closely
enough. By continually demanding more
and more millions from the taxpayer for
subsidy, semi-subsidy, and hidden subsidy
devices, Australia’s ageing farmers are
setting themselves up for takeover by the
vertically integrated contract farming
complexes.
One root problem of agricultural edu-
cation in Australia is that the farming
fraternity generally does not like having
to pay. It sees the provision of farm
extension services, veterinary services, and
so on, as a duty of government. It is
almost a case of many farmers believing
that this is what government is for.
There are some private agricultural
colleges in Australia (the Catholic Church
has a number), but, generally speaking,
they are short on facilities and their
scope is necessarily limited. The recently
established Marcus Oldham College at
Geelong, which appears to be well-en-
dowed financially, may be the forerunner
of similar institutions.
As farming has become so specialised
there may need to be more specialisation,
and more attention to regional problems,
in agricultural education. The only thing
we can contribute, by way of helpful
suggestion, is that a start to finding the
answers may be forthcoming when, and
if, farmers remove the idea from their
heads that it is a government problem
and not their own.

Tapered smoothly over the entire length for
streamlined beauty, this new type of Tubular
Steel pole has a very wide range of uses that
will appeal specially to architects and engineers.
Here are some of the main advantages:
1. Being of circular cross section and even wall
thickness throughout, they offer superior
resistance to wind forces and ensure maxi-
mum strength for carrying of top fitments.
2- High resistance to corrosion due to absence
of corners and flat surfaces.
3. Painting maintenance reduced.
4: Adaptability - suitable for Lighting, Sign-
posts, Flag Poles, TV Antennae Masts,
Telephone and Telegraph Pities and many
other structural purposes.
5. Tapered tubes are supplied in straight
lengths ready for fabrication to the required

Optimism on Myxomatosis
Still going strong in Victoria
“Tt is clear from research results that
the level of inherited resistance to
myxomatosis in the wild rabbit popula-
tion is still relatively low in practical
terms, and myxomatosis can be expected
to spread and cause worthwhile kills in
rabbits for some years to come.” So
writes Mr G. W. Douglas, deputy
chairman of the Vermin and Noxious
Weeds Destruction Board of the Vic-
torian Department of Lands, in a report
on the performance of myxomatosis in
that State since its release in 1950. This
is the most appreciative and optimistic
view of myxomatosis to be expressed in
almost a decade. Back in 1958, at a
national conference on rabbit control
held in Melbourne, Professor Frank
Fenner, of the Microbiology Depart-
ment of the Australian National - Uni-
versity, remarked that “We cannot
expect the disease on its own to keep
rabbits down to the level required for
efficient exploitation of Australia’s agri-
cultural and pastoral potential. Its
effectiveness must steadily and inex-
orably decline as natural selection in-
creases the general level of rabbit
resistance”.
Two years later, at another rabbit
control conference held in Sydney, the
subject of myxomatosis was not even
listed for discussion. And, about that
time, the CSIRO’s Division of Wildlife
Research virtually wound up its studies
on the disease and shifted the emphasis
in rabbit control to poisoning techniques
based on the use of “1080”.
The Victorians have, however, per-
sisted with the natural control weapon,
using the highly virulent Glenfield strain
of the virus. find that it still causes
a mortality between 96 p.c. and 98 p.c.
when inoculated into wild rabbits col-
lected from any part of the State. This
high killing power obviously offers an
extremely valuable degree of control.
Accordingly, the Victorian Department
strongly advocates regular inoculation
campaigns by landholders. (The num-
ber of inoculation centres in the State
has steadily increased from 416 in 1958
to 606 last year.) The Department’s own
rabbit control personnel also pursue
this policy energetically and can point
to many highly gratifying results. For
example, an outbreak was established on
Rabbit Island, off Wilsons Promontory,
in the autumn of 1965, and within a
month the high rabbit population there
had been eliminated.
The chief limitation on the effective-
ness of the disease, at least in Victoria,
would appear to be the availability of
enough mosquitoes to spread it, rather
than any weakening in the virus itself or
any resistance on the part of the rabbit.
The mosquitoes need water in which to
breed, so myxomatosis is most destruc-
tive in the high rainfall years. Thus,
excellent kills were recorded throughout
the State in 1952, 1956, 1960 and 1964.
In those years poisoning campaigns, no
matter how vigorously or properly con-
ducted, could scarcely have accom-
plished as much as the disease. Mr
Douglas’ report also draws attention to
the fact that even when a rabbit is able
to resist infection and is not killed out-
right, but merely sickened for a few
days, its chances of surviving are, never-
theless, pretty slim. Most of these weak-
ened rabbits fall easy victims to preda-
tion.

Keeping Free from
Exotic Disease
/"|nly a few months ago, cattle in
Queensland’s Mount Crosbie area
escaped infestation by the fearsome blue
tongue disease. Both primary and
secondary tests on tissues sent to South
African laboratories showed no blue
tongue.
Yet well before the results of any
testing could be made known, the
Federal Government had ordered the
mass slaughtering of the suspected
animals (not even baulking at the
requisite compensation to farmers).
Some eyebrows were naturally raised
when it was discovered that South Africa
was the nearest place for trustworthy
testing.
Support for ruthless action in dealing
with exotic animal diseases, and a plea
for more scientific veterinary services,
found a prominent place in Professor I.
Francis’ talk, “Exotic Diseases and the
Animal Industries”, delivered to the just-
concluded Symposium on North Aus-
tralian Development. Incidentally, Pro-
fessor Francis stayed refreshingly down
to earth and refrained from grinding any
particular economic or political axes.
It should be realised that “nearly all
the most feared exotic diseases are
caused by viruses and during recent years
there has been considerable spread of
virus diseases such as blue tongue, African
horse sickness, African swine fever and
a special South African type of foot
and mouth to large areas of the world
where these diseases previously did not
exist.”
With all these increasing dangers, Pro-
fessor Francis pointed out, “there are
only some 1000 veterinarians in Aus-
tralia to protect, if fully mobilised, a
country of nearly three million square
miles, a population of about 11 million
people, over 17 million cattle and about
153 million sheep”.
The present stringent quarantine pre-
cautions are plainly justified. Further
consideration should be given, however,
to disposal of garbage from overseas
ships and the risks associated with air-
craft passengers from disease-inflicted
countries.
Almost above all, both field and
laboratory veterinary services must be
strengthened. This clearly requires “better
and more adequate veterinary schools”.
The extreme dangers of isolated northern
areas also demand at least one major
laboratory with “maximum security” to
handle large-scale vaccine production.

MARKET POINTERS
A Free Tipping Service
By JASON
TAO you want a tip about a share that could rise in price by at least 10 p.c. in six,
or three or even one month?
Then look at the daily lists of stock
options written. The tips may not be
much good, but they are at least what
some people are prepared to back with
their money.
Even though most options do not pay
off, market “punters” should not fail to
keep a close eye on stock options sales.
There can be no doubt that in some
instances they give a clear hint to specu-
lative thinking about special market
situations.
Look at all the “call” options written
in recent months on Amalgamated
Chemicals. A great swag of these were
taken out early in November at 63c,
either on information or merely intelli-
gent guesswork about the . fertiliser
situation. They have certainly paid off
as two takeover offers have sent the
stock up to $l.lB or thereabouts. The
cost of this little spec, was about 12c
a share, leaving a profit of 43 cents, or
three times as much as the outlay.
Since the takeover bids were an-
nounced for Amalgamated, there have
been even more “call” options bought,
as someone clearly hopes for even better
offers. But Amalgamated Chemicals is
not the only recent success for options
holders.
Options have recently been exercised
at a profit on King Island Scheelite (the
star performer), Gold Mines of Kal-
goorlie, Kathleen Investments, United
Uranium, Greenbushes, Ravensthorpe,
Ravenshoe, Exoil, Broken Hill South and
Mount Isa, and amongst industrials,
F. W. Williams, Myer SA, International
Resistance, ACI, James Wallace, Waltons,
Auto Totes, Avala, and THE MLC.
If this meant a profit for options
holders, who would have faced charges
of at least 10 p.c., how much more profit
would have come to investors who
bought the shares themselves at a
brokerage rate of only 2 p.c. each way?
Among the options coming up for
exercise as a result of calls three and six
months ago, and on which profits will
probably be made, are Aberfoyle, Mt
Isa, Mr Lyell and New Broken Hill.
Around 38,000 Ardlethans are coming
up for exercise between now and mid-
March. These were taken out between
83 and 94c at a cost of 12c. The present
price is around $l.OB.
Of the industrials featuring in recent
“calls”, 5000 YIAs taken out for six
months at 52c (costing 11c) arouses
curiosity. (Manufacturing prefab steel
products, office partitioning and fittings,
VIA produced a spectacular trading
result for 1965.) A one-month call last
week on 1000 Petrochemical Holdings
was no doubt in response to the in-
creasingly interesting fertiliser develop-
ments. Market rises were predicted for
United Holdings, Hilton Bros, Freighters,
Publishers, Vehicle and General, Thiess,
Fire Fighting, BMI, Berlei, Swan,
Cottecs, Bisley, Golden Poultry, Borg
Warner and Allied Meat by recent options
buyers, although they were not risking
very much on most of these. Clyde
“calls” were bought in rather more sub-
stantial quantities.
Very few of the pessimists the
buyers of “put” options, who expect the
market to fall have been sufficiently
right in their estimates to justify exercis-
ing their options.
The biggest-ever mistake in the Aus-
tralian options market was the purchase
of “puts” on MLC which lost a Mel-
bourne businessman about $20,000 when
he wrongly forecast the impact of the
H. G. Palmer disasters on MLC’s share
price.
In any event, investors are optimists
by nature, so, currently, “calls” out-
number “puts” by something like six to
one.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Pressing on with Expansion
APM now operates close to capacity
T often think that Australian Paper
Manufacturers Ltd (APM) and As-
sociated Pulp and Paper Mills (Associ-
ated) are considered by many investors
to be in the same business. It is quite
common for their names to be coupled
when there is any new development in
the field of fine paper and when there is
any development in the field of packag-
ing paper. The fact that Associated is
mainly a producer of fine paper and
APM is mainly a producer of packaging
paper and board is usually completely
overlooked. The fact that past growth
rates in demand for those two types of
paper have been materially different and
the probability that future growth rates
will also differ are also overlooked.
In the previous article, I gave figures
for the percentage increases year by
year from 1957-58 onwards for the con-
sumption of fine paper. Unfortunately,
similar figures are not available to me
for the consumption of packaging paper
and paperboard, but the following figures
give the approximate annual percentage
increase in prouction. Clearly, this
pattern would be affected by imports
and stock levels:
Year to
June 30 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Percentages 11 11 4 32 12;> 11 II
APM's
sales n 1U (7) 4 14 9\ 7
While the 1960-61 and 1961-62 years
show some interruption in the growth,
there is some evidence here of a strong
upward trend and one could say that on
average the rate of increase has been
about 9 p.c. to 10 p.c. per annum. An-
other interesting fact is that, since 1954,
the growth in the per capita consumption
of paper other than fine paper has been
at the average annual compound rate of
5 p.c., whereas the growth in the per
capita consumption of fine paper only
seems to have been 4 p.c. over the whole
ten-year period.
Of course APM is not exclusively in
packaging paper and board, for over
the last five years it has continued to
supply about 4} p.c. of the fine papers
used in Australia. Yet it can generally
be said that this market is not im-
portant to APM.
However, it is only necessary to com-
pare the accounts of APM with the con-
solidated accounts of APM and its sub-
sidiaries to realise that the parent com-
pany is by far the major profit earner.
It is also interesting to note that, by
almost any standards, while growth may
not have been very dramatic, it has been
remarkably steady over the last eight
years. The indices of sales and pro-
duction in volume terms are as follows:
Year to
June 30 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Sales 100 107 120 111 117 132 145 155
Production 100 111 119 118 118 134 146 162
Again it is apparent that a setback
occurred in 1960-61 and 1961-62, but
an almost complete recovery had been
made in 1962-63. However, when we
come to compare the indices for sales
in volume with sales in value it is
apparent that the average prices of
APM’s products have fallen slightly to
1963-64, although there was a reinstate-
ment in 1964-65 and this is confirmed
by the graph in the 1965 report.
Tn these circumstances one would have
expected to find that there has been
some deterioration in APM’s profitability
rates because there can be no doubt that
at least wage costs have increased quite
substantially over the last eight years.
When w'e look at an index of earnings
per share, adjusted for new issues, con-
vertible notes and for seemingly under-
statements of the tax provision, the
following picture is seen:
Year to
June 30 1953 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
100 103 99 64 72 100 100 103
If we take net profit before tax and
depreciation instead of the adjusted earn-
ings series, this index becomes:
Year to
June 30 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
100 106 102 87 90 110 109 115
Again, the impression is of steadiness
rather than rapid growth but it is
apparent that, even in difficult times and
despite falling prices and rising costs,
the company has managed to increase
its profitability rate. This can only be
due to highly effective management.
So far as the future is concerned,
APM is pressing on with the expansion
of its paper-making capacity, for it seems
highly probable that, in the last six
months, the existing machines have been
operating close to their capacity. In
June, 1966, a new machine with a
capacity of 21,000 tons per annum will
come into operation in Western Aus-
tralia, and in 1967 a new machine with
a capacity of 70,000 tons per annum
should come into operation at Fairfield,
Victoria. Two years after this a further
paperboard machine is planned to come
into production.
Over the last eight years, APM share-
holders have seen their dividend income
increase quite satisfactorily. The average
compound rate of growth in dividends
per share has been about 5i p.c. per
annum. When the ordinary capital raised
last April is fully paid the total ordinary
capital will be $64.3 million and the
current dividend rate of 8|- p.c. will
require a payout of $5,626,250 — an
increase of 46 p.c. on the 1964-65 pay-
out. While it is perfectly apparent that
even the 1964-65 earnings, without any
earnings from the new capacity, would
be sufficient to meet this commitment, it
would be Unwise to expect any increase
in the dividend rate in the short term.
Nevertheless, over the last ten years this
rate has been raised from 7} p.c. to 8£
p.c. despite two convertible note issues
(one-for-ten in 1958 and three-for-ten in
1959), a one-for-four bonus issue, con-
version of preference shares to ordinary
shares and a one-for-five cash issue.
APM’s record is surely worthy of a
better price even than the current rather
high level of $1.80 if Associated Pulp is
worth $1.74.

More Amalgamated Chemicals
And a few selling changes
IF volume is the prime measure of importance on the stock market, then Amalgamated
Chemicals remains undisputed leader. Since my purchase of 400 shares last week
I’ve seen the shares fall back to $1.13, only to rally again when the details of the
Continental Oil offer were announced last Wednesday afternoon.
It seemed certain that such an offer
was forthcoming on the Wednesday
morning, when the financial editors of
all the major papers received a photo
of the president of Continental! The
bid of $1.20 (after the final dividend for
the 1965 year) for 65 p.c. of the share
capital is decidedly a better deal than the
original offer by Dow Chemicals. How-
ever, as Dow has whetted its appetite,
it may do an “Esso” with a revised offer.
On the Tuesday I had purchased a
further 200 shares at $1.15, to bring
my holding up to 600 shares. If I can
ultimately sell The lot for $1.30, I’ll end
up with a small profit and be quite happy.
On this subject of selling, I have made
several changes to the portfolio. By
itself the interim report of Union Car-
bide read well enough. But when
matched up against the chairman’s
optimistic report given only a few months
ago, it registered a disappointing change.
Selling at $3.65 proved to be a break-
even proposition.
I fared much better with Tennyson
Textiles. Through no fault of the com-
pany, the shares had been marked down
to 70c when I bought them. The present
price of 82c is a more realistic one and
that is the price at which my shares were
sold. Result a $l7 profit.
The other sale of the week was the
Canberra Television at $1.35. A promis-
ing interim report, including the raising
of the annual rate of dividend from
8 p.c. to 10 p.c., but not spectacular
enough to bring fresh interest into the
stock.
Instead of supporting the television
industry in Canberra, I’ve decided to
swing my interest south to Wagga.
Riverina Television is one of the newer
country stations, having commenced
transmission on June 18, 1964. It usually
takes two years of transmission before a
television station breaks even. By show-
ing a marginal profit of $3094 in the
1964- 65 year, Riverina Television
managed to achieve a break-even stage in
just one year.
Like any other television station, the
future of Riverina Television depends on
advertising and cost of programming.
With no commercial competition in its
telecasting area, covering 125,000 per-
sons, advertising volume should not be
a problem. As for programmes, the tie-
up with the John Fairfax group (which
owns a substantial part of the capital)
should ensure that programme costs
never become exorbitant. With the
interim report only just around the
corner, I purchased 400 shares at 74c.
This, together with 400 Western
Titanium ctg. shares at $1.15, made up
the purchases for the week. The whole
mining market has gone into a slide,
with no discrimination between the bad
and the good. At $1.15 the Western
Titanium ctg. shares looked cheap against
the price of $1.28 recorded in the
previous week.
While copper is currently the glamor
metal, it is the beach sands that should
prove the most stable ir behavior. And
of the beach sands companies, Western
Titanium is probably the most exciting.
Last year, sales rose by 60 p.c. and profit
doubled. In that year, production of
ilmenite was 142,000 tons and produc-
tion of zircon was 9000 tons. Directors
now plan to lift production of ilmenite
to 200,000 tons. So this would ensure a
further healthy increase in profits, even
if the prices of ilmenite and zircon
remained only steady.
The week’s transactions were:
SOLD
400 Tennyson Textiles, 82c $321
300 Canberra Television $1.35 .. $397
100 Union Carbide, $3.65 $357
BOUGHT
400 Riverina Television, 74c .... $3Ol
400 West. Titanium ctg., $1.15 .. $470

changed to the credit side, with a figure
of $63.

Beer is dest . . . A dedicated soul, the true beer drinker. His educated palate
is sensitive to minute differences in taste and temperature.
At Frigrite, we go to a lot of trouble to keep people like this happy. With Frigrite
refrigeration. Glass chillers, even. Freezers, too.
We keep him cool on the outside, with Frigrite air conditioning.
And should his drinking companion be a Scotch man, more than likely it’s cooled with
ice from a Frigrite ice-maker.
As a matter of fact, Frigrite go to a lot of trouble for everybody—in air conditioning,
refrigeration, agriculture and industry.
