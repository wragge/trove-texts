LITERARY NOTES.
“Celt” is a label which covers a lot, yet
William and Elizabetli Sharp—jointly re-
sponsible for a new anthology of Celtic verse
—seem almost to regret that it does not
cover more. In fact, there is in the intro-
duction to “Lyra Celtica ” a hint that, if
you banish the Celt from tlie realm of poesy,
there will be hardly any realm left. It
appears that a Celtic poet is, firstly, a poet
born under Celtic skies. Or, second, he is a
poet of Celtic blood born under any skies—
and a very little blood, a very long way off,
is sufficient when the Sharps are out for
scalps to decorate the Celtic wigwam. Or,
third, a Celtic poet is anybody who cannot
be proved not to have been Celtic—Shakes-
peare, for example. Or, fourth, a Celtic poet
is anybody in whose work Mr. Sharp can find
the Celtic soul—like Robert Louis Stevenson
(a typical Scotch Lowlander). So that Mil-
ton, cockney Keats, lowland Burns, Byron,
and even Swinburne were born real Celts, in
• —O dexterous phrase ! —“ the geography of
the soul.”
♦ ♦ * *
It is no wonder, thus, although the editor’s
practice does not go quite as far as the preface-
maker’s theory, that the present volume of
500 Bvo. pages is only to be considered as a
foretaste of a big Celtic book which is coming
in a year or three. Most people will rest
content with the little one, which contains
many old favorites, and many new pieces
which as yet are only to be had in rare
volumes and limited editions. An anthology
should be good nowadays to justify itself, and
this Celtic one is good enough. The appen-
dix of biographical notes on the sampled
authors is an excellent feature. One reads
that when Gerald Griffin’s “ Eileen Aroon ”
(Nellie, my darling) came under his notice,
Tennyson “ went mooning about for days,”
repeating with endless gusto the lovely
closing lines :
Youth must with time.decay,
Eileen Aroon !
Beauty must fade away,
Eileen Aroon !
Castles are sacked in war,
Chieftains are scattered far,
Truth is a fixed star,
Eileen Aroon !
* * * *
As a flower from the Celtic bouquet, take
this little piece in modern vein :
POPPIES.
The sudden night is here at once :
The lost lamb cries and runs and stands,
For all the poppy cups are hands
To seize and take him when he runs.
The dusky cups are blood colour ;
And like a cup of blood this one
To drink, and be with Babylon,
And love and kiss the lips of her.
Thy sins as snow ! —just then it burned
The dark —a flaming face and bust;
And just beneath here in the dust
The Scarlet Woman laughed and turned.
Charles Weekes.

Even as a poet, Coventry Patmore is little
known in Australia. As a critic, few of us
can appreciate him ; and it seems that “the
reader who desires to obtain a full view of
him as an aesthetic writer must travel back ”
to the reviews of 30 or 40 years ago. In the
March Bookman, Richard Garnett accuses
him of making the author whom he criticises
“less his quarry than his stalking-horse,”
and elevates his capacity at the expense of
his critical capacity. But there is pith in
these of Patmore’s dicta :
The follies of a Blake or a Hartley Coleridge
are venial when compared with those of the
thoughtful and prudent fool—the fool in respect of
great things, as the other is in respect of small.
It is a peculiarity of the very highest work of
every kind that it is not the result of painful
labor, but that it is easier to do it than not to do
it, when it can be done at all.
A wise or tender phrase in the mouth of a
Byron or a Moore will be despised, where a com-
monplace of morality or affection in that of a
Wordsworth or a Burns will be respected.
Originality consists simply in a man’s being
upon his own line. A society of persons of true
originality in manners would be like an oak—the
leaves of which all look alike until they are care-
fully compared, when it is found that they are all
different.
All the music of verse arises, not from infraction,
but inflection of the law of the set metre.
The real value of a large aquamarine may be
more than that of a small emerald.
In the realms of art and letters genius is, in its
initial stage, perceptive reason, the rare power of
seeing self-evident, things.

Dr. W. Wright quotes the maxims in
which three-well known artists embodied for
him their theories of art. Said Church, the
American painter of Niagara and Damas-

the leading feature.” Said Holman Hunt :
“Put your conscience into every leaf you
paint, and line you write.” Said Leighton :
“ Do little or do much, but do it well.”
* * * *
Lovers of Matthew Arnold may be com-
mended to Frederic Harrison’s essay in the
March Nineteenth Century, which stimu-
lates new admiration for Harrison’s critical
ability. Indeed, of all critics now writing,
he strikes one as likest to Arnold him-
self—So lucid, so impartial, so sane. “ No
poet,” he declares, “ in the roll of our
literature, unless it he Milton, has been so
essentially saturated to the very bone with
the classical genius”—as Arnold. He is
classical “ in the serene self-command, the
harmony of tone, the measured fitness, the
sw'eet reasonableness of his verse.” He is
never “incoherent, spasmodic, careless,
washy, or banal. He never fliesupinto aregion
where the sun melts his wings ; he strikes
no discords, and he never tries a mood for
which he has no gift. He has more general
insight into the intellectual world of our age,
and he sees into it more deeply and
more surely than any contemporary poet.”
(This is true. Tennyson mostly transmutes
dubious intellectual commonplace into sound-
ing harmony : he is essentially shallow.
Browning goes deeper, but his verse-stuff is
tagged witli quirks, and cranks, and thin
emotional threads : it isn’t reason - proof.
Arnold not only fits your mood, but fills and
satisfies your mind).
* * * *
“On the other hand,” says Harrison,
Matthew Arnold has “little passion, small
measure of dramatic sense, but a moderate
gift of movement or of color, and—what is
perhaps a more serious want—no sure ear for
melody and music.” The “ sure ” qualifies
into correctness a statement which would
otherwise be instantly challenged by ‘ ‘ The
Forsaken Merman” and the hymn in “Em-
pedocles,” and half-a-dozen other deliciously
rhythmical pieces. But Harrison distin-
guishes between “music ” and “modulation
and polish,” and suggests, among others,
three lines from “The Merman” itself in
support of his judgment :
—From heaths starr’d with broom,
And high rooks throw mildly
On the blanch’d sands a gloom.
* * * *
Certainly, these lines are not musical when
repeated aloud. But is it always necessary
that verse-music be considered from the
view-point of oral emphasis ? Is there
not a music of the eye as well as of the ear ?
To illustrate : an expert musician does not
need to play a score over to understand
and enjoy it. It sings to him by vision.
Possibly he might receive a truer, fuller,
better impression of it when played aloud ;
but can it be contended that poetry and
music, in this respect, stand, on the
same footing 1 Quite conceivably not. Some
minds are helped to a better understanding
of “Hamlet” by Irving’s acting ; but it is
clear that a mind more in tune with the spirit
of the play than Irving’s is—and doubtless
there are many such—might rather be ham-
pered by an interpretation of that spirit
which did not chime with its own.
* * * *
This is a delicate and devious theme, but
the writer, at all events, would be disposed
to hold that the capacity of poetry to be read
aloud is not an ultimate, or even a necessary,
test of its merit; that the poet who appeals
chiefly to the eye does not inevitably take a
lower status than he who appeals chiefly to
the ear ; and that, consequently, since there
is no finality of standard, every poet should
be regarded as a challenged duellist, and
permitted to choose, in this matter, his own
weapons, his own standard—rapier or pistol,
eye or ear. To take a local example, Victor
Daley is an exceedingly clever color-poet, but
a comparatively moderate tone-poet. His
harmonies often appeal more to eye than to
ear : his verse often loses, rather than gains,
by being read aloud. Then why insist that
reading-aloud should be a criterion of it
merit ? Every cultured person knows that
he does not consciously read letters, or even
words. The practised reader’s eye flashes to
his mind at once the picture-meaning of a
phrase, a whole sentence. Often, with a
single glance at a page, he can disinter the
buried thought, or thoughts, which are its
message. The sound of letters, or words, or
sentences, need not concern him at all. Is
it not then possible to insist too much on the
canon of vocal melody ?
» * * *
This divagation has nothing whatever to
do with some pregnant remarks by Harrison
on the general principles of criticism, which
are accordingly here quoted from the same
essay :
Criticism, according to Arnold’s practice, if not
according to his theory, had as its duty to lay
down decisive canons of cultured judgment to sift
the sound from the vicious, and to maintain the
purity of language and style. To do all this in
any masterly degree requires most copious know-
ledge, and almost encyclopaedic training in litera-
ture, a natural genius for form and tone, and
above all a temper of judicial balance. Johnson,
in the last century, Hallam, and possibly Southey,
in this century, had some such gift. Macaulay
and Carlyle had not; for they wanted genius for
form and judicial balance. Now, Arnold had
this gift in supreme degree, in a degree superior to
Johnson or to Hallam. He made far fewer mis-
takes than they did. He made very few mistakes.
The touchstone of the great critic is to make very
few mistakes, and never to be carried off his
balance by any pet aversion or pet affection of his
own, not to be biassed so much as a hair’s breadth
by any salient merit or any irritating defect, and
always to keep an eye well open to the true pro-
portion of any single book in the great world of
men and of affairs, and in the mighty realm of
general literature.
For this reason we have so very few great critics,
for the combination of vast knowledge, keen taste,
and serene judgment is rare. It is thus so hard
for any young person, for women, to become great
in criticism : the young lack the wide experience ;
women lack the cool judicial temper. It is com-
mon enough to find those who are very sensitive
to some rare charm, very acute to detect a subtle
quality, or justly severe on some seductive failure.
The ire power is to be able to apply to a compli-
cated set of qualities the nicely adjusted compen-
sations, to place a work, an author, in the right
rank, and to do this for all orders of merit, with a
sure, constant, unfailing touch—and without any
real or conspicuous mi-take.
* * * *
By the \yay, Harrison himself would come
off hardly were ‘ ‘ the capacity to be read
aloud ” insisted on as one of the distinctive
standards of good literature. The Positivist
prophet is a little, oldish, greyish man w ith
hardly voice enough for chamber-oratory, let
alone an organ-hall; and his essays are in-
comparably better read than heard.
* * * *
Again by the way, Mr. W. M‘Millan,
also a little man, and also with large ideas,
is reported to have instructed a Sydney
audience, the other day, to avoid current
literature, and adhere limpetly to the old
classics. Passing the obvious rejoinder that
the audience which adhered to the classics
would never hear Mr. M‘Millan, it is quite
clear that, if the gentleman really did say
anything like this, the gentleman is wrong.
The chief use of the old classics is as a
pleasant guide to present conduct, and
to use them to the utmost of their
old classical capacity you must have
the gloss of current literature. Matthew
Arnold, for example, would probably rank
as a classic in the M‘Millan sense of the
word, and doubtless Arnold can be enjoyed
independently of the dicta of Harrison or
other critics, but the lover of Arnold who
dips into the Nineteenth Century gets a
keener zest for his enjoyment. He finds,
maybe, his own opinion crystallised in
the inevitable words which he could not
himself command ; or he finds an an-
tagonistic opinion which sets him keenly
on the alert to examine and defend his own
opinion ; and either way he profits. Classi-
cal literature is good, but current literature
is sometimes as good, and always as necessary
to a complete education. Mr. M‘Millan’s
theory would deprive his followers of the
high privilege of contact with the best minds
of the ago ; and to what purpose ?
* * * *
Miss Badham, another Sydney lecturer of
capacity, fell into a similar error when she
exhorted a little suburban flock to steer
straight for Kipling and others, and shun the
gulf of Sarah Grand and others. Miss
Badham, like Mr. M'Millan, has her pre-
liminary paradox, for plainly she has plumbed
that gulf-—or how could she know where it
is ? And how can an accurate view of cur-
rent literature be obtained without some ex-
amination of the school of Sarah G. and her
kindred ? In truth and in fact, it is a grave
literary offence for a gentlemanly Ipse Dixit
or a lady-like Ex Cathedra to rise and attempt
to narrow the scope of the enquiring mind.
The first essential of ariy mind which is a
mind is catholicity. It gleans in every
field, and everywhere adds to its sheaf. It
cannot, without loss, pass on its task of
judgment to any other mind whatever : Ipse
and Ex may give evidence if they like ; but
from Ego must come the verdict. And a
local motto for every reader might be : No
eclecticism before survey !

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I w rile you thie acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous 1 had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.’’
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the hack and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.” —Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
59 other leading residents.

BEFORE YOU
T. E A. F ;
When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-
tation m the form of a pretty show ; there is
.B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and C
who says that he is the man for your money •
and so on, throughout a list as long as

thing to say and to offer.
Please Pause
Hearken not to the song of the syren, sing

the charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Your pocket’s concerned ; and there are
pirates about. As the poet pertinently puts
it: “There be land-sharks and water
sharks, and it is for you to see that your
dealings are with none of these voracious
monsters. Take warning in time, for it will
be no use when the new taxes come round—

In the slighted, blighted North where the giant
kauris grow, 6
And the earth is bare and barren where the bush-
bee usec * to hum,
When the luok we’ve followed’s failing and our
A , . a . re out of hailing,
And it’s getting narrow sailing by the rocks of
Kingdom Come ?
ihere s a way of fighting woe, squaring store-bills
as you go,
In the trade of digging gum.
And the new-chum and the scum
. And the scouring of the slum,
And the lawyer and the doctor, and the deaf and
halt and dumb,
And the parson and the sailor, and the welsher
and the whaler,
When the world is looking glum,
Just to keep from Kingdom Come,
Take to digging kauri gum.
In the. scrubby, grubby North when the giddy sun
is set,
And the idiot-owl-cicada stops the whirring of
his drum;
When the night is growing thicker and the bottled
candles flicker,
And the damned mosquitoes bicker in a diabolic
hum,
There s a way of ending fret and of pulling down
a debt
In the task of scraping gum.
And the new-chum and the scum
And the scouring of the slum,
And the lawyer and the doctor, and the deaf and
halt and dumb,
And the parson and the sailor, and the welsher
and the whaler,
When the world is looking glum,
Just to keep from Kingdom Come,
Take to scraping kauri gum.
In the sloppy, floppy North through the dismal
winter rain,
When the man is merely muscle and the mind is
nearly numb,
When the old, old pains rheumatic fill the bones
from base to attic
And a sound of words erratic sets the pannikins
a-thrum,
There’s a way of killing Cain and an antidote to
pain
In the task of hooking gum.
And the new-chum and the scum
And the scouring of the slum,
And the lawyer and the doctor, and the deaf and
halt and dumb,
And the parson and the sailor, and the welsher
and the whaler,
When the world is looking glum,
Just to keep from Kingdom Come,
Take to hooking kauri gum.
And the man of law has gambled through another
man’s estate,
And the doctor’s special weakness at the present
time is rum,
And the parson loves the clocking on a pretty
maiden’s stocking,
And his stories (mostly shocking) scare the
neophyte new-chum.
By the smouldering ti-tree fire, when the wind is
howling higher,
They are cracking jokes that blister the Recording
Angel’s slate,
And the matters that they mention are too primi-
tive to state
At the scraping of the gum.
But the new-chum and the scum
And the scouring of the slum,
And the lawyer and the doctor, and the deaf and
halt and dumb,
And the parson and the sailor, and the welsher
and the whaler,
When the Day of Judgment’s come
O, won’t they be looking glum !
As the mighty trumpets thunder and the harps go
tinkle-tum,
And they’ve finished with the digging and they’ve
scraped the final crumb,
And the bottom’s gone for ever from the trade of
kauri gum.

The Alleged Small Landholder.
The continually increasing lack in New
South Wales of available land within easy
reach of a market, and of such quality that
it will afford a living, or even an existence, to
the small holder, is driving the Government
to follow the example set in Maoriland and
take measures to “ burst up the big estates.”
According to Minister Carruthers, an
attempt will probably be made next session
to pass an Act whereby the Government will
be empowered to compulsorily purchase large
holdings, and re-sell them in small lots on
easy terms. In other words, instead of
“ opening up to settlement ” the remote
wastes of the Central District, where roads
and railways are few, and water scarce, and
droughts plentiful, and markets far-off and
ruinously expensive to reach, the Reid
Government has begun to realise the truth
of The Bulletin’s oft-repeated state-
ment that it is the Eastern Division
of the province which most wants open-
ing. Within the last year or so there
has sprung up in the Cornstalk province an
unusually intense desire to go on the land,
not because the land holds out any greater
promise than it used to do, but rather because
it and the Benevolent Asylum are almost the
only places left to go to, consequently G. H.
Reid and Co. promise to fill a great and
urgent want, and desefve the thanks of the
community accordingly.
* » * *
The large property-owner has become so
widely recognised as a public evil that hardly
anybody save the National Ass seriously
defends him. It is to the interest of the
community to create a great mass of indepen-
dent proprietors rather than a handful of
big landholders and beneath them a nation
of slavish, hard-worked, underpaid peasants,
and this for at least a dozen good and easily
understood reasons. The division of the
country into small holdings enables the soil
to support a larger population, therefore it
relieves the congestion in the cities and allevi-
ates the unemployed evil which is always
with us. It causes the unearned increment
—that good old phrase of which everyone is
now so weary —to be divided among a larger
number of people, therefore it tends to
create a great multitude of well-to-do agri-
culturists instead of a society with a few
bloated millionaires on the top looking for
titles in England, and beneath a vast mass
of helpless poverty. It increases the num-
ber of people who have, in the well-worn
phrase of the National Ass, a stake in the
country, and who will defend it if need be
because they have something in it that is
worth defending. Closer settlement in the
interior means more railway traffic and, con-
sequently, more revenue ; greater possibili-
ties of irrigation, because there is a larger
population to bear the expense ; a diminution
of the class which is addicted to taking its
wealth to Europe and turning absentee, and
an increase in the class which is inclined to
take root in the country ; and many other
things. And undoubtedly there is great
need to foster the small proprietary class in
New South Wales. Of the 42,000,000
acres alienated in that province up to the end
of ’94, one-half was held in areas of over
10,000 acres ; and 043 persons owned
half the private lands of the province
at an average of 32,633 acres apiece. The
small holdings (under 201 acres) amounted to
only 2,190,000 acres. In 15 years 19,300,000
acres were sold by the State, and 10,800,000
acres of this went in areas of over 10,000
acres each, while only 300,000 acres went in
small farms of 200 acres and under. In
other words, during 15 years the area held
in lots of 200 acres and under hardly in-
creased at all; that held in lots from 200 to
1000 acres increased about 40 per cent. ; the
area held in estates between 1000 and 10,000
acres more than doubled, and the space held
in areas of over 10,000 acres also more than
doubled. A province which is progressing
backwards in this fashion badly wants to do
something to its large estate-holders.
* * * *
Unfortunately the method proposed by the
Reid Government, though good in itself, is
wholly insufficient. By obtaining power to
acquire large properties and re-sell them in
small lots on easy terms, something may be
done to create a desirable class of small pro-
prietors ; the difficulty is to keep them in
existence after they are created. For many
years the State, by its land-selection laws,
has been creating an exactly similar class,
and they have kept vanishing almost as fast
as created. Many of them were dummy
selectors, whose lands were peacefully ab-
sorbed in due course by the adjacent squatter.
An enormous number were eaten up by
hanks, finance companies, and private money-
lenders, who accumulated large estates by
the foreclosure of the mortgages they held
over many small proprietors. Other estates
have been built up by systematic purchase.
The people have been going on the land in a
continual stream for a generation or more,
and they have hardly begun to arrive there
in any definite sense even now. The number
of small selectors who have gone amiss-
ing out of the New South Wales list
of land-holders is an amazing quantity.
And if the Reid Government sets
itself systematically to cut up big estates
and settle small independent agriculturists
on the land, and the bank or finance co.
which principally infests that special locality
keeps on devouring them in the good old
way, until the big estates come into existence
again in a slightly alleviated form, it only
means much labor to very little purpose.
♦ ♦ * *
The experience of the past shows that
something more is needed than merely to
subdivide the land and leave it at that.
What is wanted is a system of taxation
which will make large estates so much less
profitable than small ones that no person
with a due regard for his own interest will
want to be a large estate-holder. The
remedy, as The Bulletin has pointed out
on previous occasions with an iteration
which has made many persons feel very
weary indeed, is a graduated land-tax, only
with a steeper graduation than has yet been
attempted. If the system were applied in the
Eastern Division of New South Wales, where
the need of land for close settlement is most
urgent, and, assuming that all agricultural
holdings under, say, 400 acres were free of
tax, that all from 400 to 1000 acres paid Id.
in the £ on their capital value ; those
between 1000 and 2000 acres, 2d. ; those
between 2000 and 3000 acres, 3d! ; and
thereafter an extra Id. in the £ for each
additional 3000 acres, until a maximum of,
say, 9d. in the £ was reached, the results
would be somewhat as follows. Assuming
that the land in its untaxed state was worth
£1 per acre all round, and that the average
rental was 5 per cent, on the value, an
estate of 400 acres would remain worth £1
per acre. One of 1000 acres, by reason of
the tax, would be worth 18s. 4d. an acre
A property of 2000 acres would be worth
16s. Bd. per acre ; one of 3000 acres, 15s. ;
one of 6000 acres, 13s. 4d. ; one of 12,000
acres only 10s. ; and so on till the value of
the largest was only ss. per acre. Thus the
man who cut up a massive property and sold
it m small allotments would increase the
value by so doing, and profit thereby
while the one who swallowed up a
number of small owners and made one
vast property out of their combined home-
steads, would make his estate less valuable
the more of it he acquired. In the pastoral
districts of the centre and west the untaxed
area would have to be greatly enlarged, and
the tax would necessarily increase more
gradually, and in the urban districts the tax
would have to go by value instead of area
but the principle would remain the same in
all cases.
* * * *
Under some such policy the land would not
require to be subdivided by any forciblepro
cess of law ; it would subdivide itself. More-
over, it would remain subdivided, which is
another and quite a different thing.
system would prevent English an ° *
foreign syndicates holding estates in this
country, for a considerable area is necessaiy
to make it worth a foreign syndicate s while
to exist as a landholder, and the tax would
make that area not worth holding. It would
practically shut down on the absentee laiM-
lord industry ; only tlie very wealthy
landholder can go 'Ome to skirmish tor
a title at the Imperial Institute,* and
that person would be gradually ex-
tinguished. It would prevent banks
and finance companies bloating themselves
with hundreds of thousands of acres of un-
saleable property, to their own ultimate- un-
doing. It would greatly reduce the land-
jobbing business, for even the temporary
ownership of extensive properties would be a
costly process. If considered necessary, a
year or two’s notice might be given before
bringing such a law into operation, in order
to give the people most affected time to stand
from under, but, beyond this, there is no
reason why they should receive any considera-
tion whatever. The Retd Government has
already expressed the conviction, by its pro-
posed policy, that it is advisable, in the in-
terests of the country, to create a class of
small landholders in place of the overgrown
proprietors w r ho now own more than half the
alienated portion of the province. The Bul-
letin invites it to further consider the fact
that there is little gained by bringing that
class into existence unless it can be kept in
existence afterwards, and experience has, so
far, shown that under present conditions it
can’t be kept in existence to any extent
worth mentioning.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Exit Parkes.
The death of Henry Parkes removes a man
who, ten or fifteen years ago, was regarded as
indispensable and irreplaceable in New South
Wales politics, and who drops out after all, as
most “indispensable” men do, without leaving
any perceptible vacancy. Parkes looked for
many years like a massive historical figure.
He had the art of seeming great, yet no one
could really remember, even at the zenith of his
career, that he ever did anything in particular
to deserve his reputation. He was a master of
the science and mystery of remaining—and
that was about all. No one could boss a party
better than he did, and yet he never knew how
to use it for any great purpose, save the pur-
pose of keeping the party together. No one
could steer a party into office so adroitly as he,
yet when he had office he never knew what to do
with it, except to keep it as long as possible and
then get back to it with all convenient speed.
He never learned that the country wanted
measures more than men—even if the most con-
spicuous of the men was Parkes. Therefore
he kept the counlry waiting 25 years for the
promised system of Local Government, and left
it waiting when he died ; he kept it waiting for
Freetrade and never gave it ; he promised land
reform, financial reform, the North Shore
bridge, the land-tax, and any number of other
things which also never came. He never really
understood that the country was serious in its
desire for anything ; his idea of politics was
simply that there should be two parties, on the
English model ; that each party should be
slavishly subservient to its leader ; that the
sole business of each party was to get into
power and stay there; that the difference
between parties was simply that one wanted to
put Parkes in power, and that the other
wanted Robertson, or Stuart, or Dibbs ; that
the country existed to support these two
parties ; and that the object of legislation or
promises of legislation w'as simply to please
the country to such an extent that it
would support Parkes, or Robertson or
Stuart, or Dibbs, or some other man. In
which respect he was like the ordinary poli-
tician of his school. Under these circumstances
the advent of the Labor party in New South
VV ales politics killed Parkes politically. It
reduced his political world to chaos and threw
him hopelessly out of his bearings. Govern-
ment by Contradiction was the only art he had
ever learned, and he had learned it to per-
fection; but that system is based on the theory
that there shall always be two parties in
politics, no more and no less, and that each
shall support its leader, whether right or
wrong, and have no conscience save his The
advent of a third section which actually
anv of ,°1 d °r t UllgS J Whidl Wouldn ’t follow
any of the two recognised leaders ; which
didn t regard party tactics, and the great art of
remaining, and the loaves and fishes as the
whole mystery of politics; which refused
flatly to recognise that the one busffiess
of Parliament was to be divided into
parties which aimlessly contradicted each

Federation. T. Dowling’s ideas on the subject
are unique in their mild simplicity, as will be
seen by the following sample :
Nobody was more desirous of Federation than himself,
but he would not sacrifice any principles or smash up the
Constitution to attain it. He was vitally opposed to the
system of representatives at the convention being- elected,
not bv Parliament, but by the people. Federation was a
grand thing, but this was too great a price for it alto-
gether. He did not believe that under the Enabling Bill
the best men would be returned.
So far as can be judged by the debates in the
Council, T. Dowling’s attitude in this matter
is that of the 48 Rich Landlords in general. T.
Dowling, however, seems to be the first land-
lord of them all who has had the courage to
deliberately call his constituents together and
tell them what he thinks of their mental
c.ipacity ; also, he is the first landlord who has
been sufficient of a blatant ass to do so. Accord-
ing to T. Dowling, the people can’t be trusted
to elect the members of the Federal Con-
vention because they don’t know how to
choose “ the best men.” The same people
elected Dowling, therefore Dowling isn’t one
of the best men. Dowling is to be entrusted
with the selection of the Convention delegates
because he is good enough for that duty, but
the people who politically created him can’t
be allowed a voice in the matter because they
haven’t sufficient sense to be entrusted with the
work. Here the attitude gets a good deal
mixed. Either T. Dowling knows himself to
be an ancient and reliable ass, and the fact that
the people elected him is a proof that they can’t
be trusted with the power of election ; or else
T. Dowling isn’t an ass, and in that case the
fact that the people elected him shows that they
can be trusted with the aforesaid power. In
other words : The people elected T. Dowling,
and if Dowling is good enough to be trusted
with the selection of the constitution-makers,
that circumstance proves that they are
capable of selecting a good man, in which
case there is no earthly reason why they
shouldn’t make the selection themselves;
or else T. Dowling is an incapable, and
the idea of leaving the selection to
him is absurd. Anyhow, the spectacle of
Dowling, who was created by the people and
is their servant, telling the people that he
won’t allow them to have Federation, except on
his own terms, and that for T. Dowling to
allow the people (who can unmake him when
they feel that way inclined) to have a voice in
the matter is really absurd, is a beautiful
example of arrogance. The best answer to this
inflated creature, who says that it is better to
lose the chance of a united Australia than tread
on the dignity of T. Dowling, is to cast him
out bodily when he comes up for re-election
two years hence, and to do it sooner if possible,
and, at any rate, to do it with a thud that will
be heard all over Australia. T. Dowling ought
to be politically thrown out with such vim as to
enable the people at Cape York to distinctly
hear his skull crack. The Bulletin presumes
that T. Dowling has some sort of a skull.
The Newcastle Strike.
Newcastle (N.S. W.) colliers have gone out on
strike for higher wages, after an abortive con-
ference with the masters. The men pick a time
when trade is reviving, and a large number of
vessels are in the port. Their work is paid by the
piece, and is differentiated on an elaborate
scale, and the conditions vary so much in differ-
ent mines and at different times that it is ex-
tremely difficult for anyone but a local expert
to reach a general conclusion as to the rights
and wrongs of the dispute ; and the experts
contradict one another flatly. The men pro-
duce pay-sheets to show that some miners, in
some mines, at some times, have worked for a
starvation pittance; the masters are equally
ready with proof that other men in other mines
at the same times, or in the same mines at other
times, or under different conditions Jn the same
mines at the same times, have earned splendid
wages. Striking the best average obtainable,
it would appear that the industry doesn’t pay
the laborers precariously employed in it any-
thing like decent wages. That is, on the whole,
the rights of the dispute are with the men, who
are entitled to more money if they can get it.
the question whether they can get it opens up
an entirely fresh set of considerations as to the
expediency of the strike, quite apart from the
question of right. The owners say they can’t
raise wages without raising the price of coal,
and they can t raise the price of coal vilhout
driving the export trade to Japan and other
places where competition with Newcastle,
nourished by previous strikes, is already
successfully carried on. The miners con-
tradict this; and it is impossible to say
decisively which side knows most about the
matter until the experiment is tried. As the

m reach justice. There will not then exist the
olaspheiny-provoking spectacle of a suitor in
the Equity Court having his claim dismissed
“ with costs ” because his remedy is at Law, or
of a plaintiff at Law being restrained by an in-
junction of the Equity Judge from proceeding
with his suit at Law, because the defendant has
a good defence in Equity of which the Law Courts
will not allow him to take advantage. The
department of pleading, too, will come in for
its badly-wanted share of reform. The present
system is a survival from the middle ages.
One of its worst features is the gross ignorance
in which it leaves one or other of the parties to
a suit, as to the lines on which the case is to be
pursued or defended. A plaintiff never knows
the real defence a defendant is going to set up.
If he did, he would be able to bring out the
witnesses necessary to meet it; at present he
must bring to court everybody who knows any-
thing about the case for fear the evidence may be
wanted, and lest he should be taken by surprise
at the trial; and defendant is in the same
predicament. Add to this that the pleadings,
with their rejoinders, rebutters, demurrers,
and so on, are highly technical; so that it may,
and often does, happen that judgment is given
on them alone, without a tittle of evidence
being heard, and without any regard for the
justice or merits of the case. Under the pro-
mised Act the plaintiff will set out plainly in
paragraph form the various points of his case,
and defendant will, in like manner, state his
defence ; then suitors will have a fair chance of
getting their case to a jury, and there will be
less scope for all the frill and froth with
which the Jeremy Diddlers mask their
doubts and duplicities. This is one of the best
features of the Judicature Act, but Premier
Reid appears inclined to give Loo much weight
to the opinions of some “very high lawyers”
who are opposed to the new pleading. Of
course they are—to what reform are they not
opposed ? Besides, having grown old under a
particular system, they naturally object to any
change in it. Premier Reid says, too, that
they (“the high lawyers”) are of opinion that
the new method of pleading is open to abuse.
So is any system. The existing one is grossly
abused, and it would be a physical impossibility
for any newer method to completely do away
with the games of the stupidly mischievous or
intelligently malicious lawyers. It is, how-
ever, the duty of the Court to see that its pro-
ceedings are not abused, and this matter may
be safely left in the hands of the Judges. The
style of pleading which has been in vogue in
N.S. Wales for years in the Equity and Divorce
Courts is chiefly modelled on the Act sought to
be introduced, and, if it has proved a success
(as it admittedly has) in these jurisdictions, it
would puzzle the slippery brain of a Salomons
to say why it should not also give satisfaction
in the Common Law r Courts. The Judges will
be given ample powers—which they have not
at present —to deal with that hoary old abuse,
sham pleading; then there will be no more
“pleading to gain time,” and the pettifog-
ging lawyer will lose a large source of
revenue, and another of the blots on the admin-
istration of (alleged) justice will disappear.
Terms will be done away with, and the Court
will sit for the hearing of causes all the year
round —save, of course, during the inevitable
vacations ; and thus another license for fee-
thieving will be squelched. The Judges will
be empowered to call in skilled men, actuaries,
accountants, and other scientific persons, in
order to hear and determine causes with their
assistance. This may or may not prove
to be a valuable innovation, in proportion
as the expert is chosen for brains and integrity,
or for his social standing, but it is, at all
events, one that will find favor with suitors.
Upon these lines, or half of them, the introduc-
tion of the Judicature Act will be the greatest
legal reform initiated in,N.S. Wales for many
years. In simplifying legal procedure it will
also do something towards cheapening it. I
fear, however, that “cheap law ” is still in the
distant future: Mr. Reid is not much of a
lawyer, but he is too much of a lawyer for
that.— Shark.
The Melb. Hospital Lady Meds.
Writes a well-known Bulletin correspon-
dent :
The latest annual appointment of six resident medical
officers at Melbourne Hospital is a historic event. Two
ladies were, for the first time, included among- the first
half-dozen students of the year, and, in the natural course
of things, this promising pair claimed the privilege ac-
corded by custom to the highest graduates. Their invasion
of the ancient male monopoly was hotly opposed (also m
the natural course of things) by the monopolistic party,
and the local Arqcs was laid on to suggest all sorts of
alleged reasons why women should be denied the oppor-
tunity to gain medical experience in treating out-patients,
casualty cases, &c., at a hospital open to sufferers of both
sexes. The organ of fossildom and vested interests quoted
the foolish remarks of ignorant patients, groaning upon
hospital beds, as evidence that lady doctors are an insult
to civilisation. The prejudiced drivel of Professor Halford
was splashed in the face of the Argus’s own con-
servative Fat Man, who found the stuff very refresh-
ing. But nothing came of this pitiable demonstration
save a full exposure of its failure. The tw T o lady students
placed fourth and sixth, respectively, on the exam, list
will take up their quarters at Melbourne Hospital for
twelve months, and society at large will, to some small
degree, be benefited by the novelty. 1600 feminine cases
are admitted to the institution every year. Of these the
more enlightened minority will accept medical treatment
from one of their own sex as thankfully as they consent
to be washed by a neat-handed Phyllis, instead of plead-
ing for a hall porter to perform that service. Twenty
years hence no woman with pretensions to a sense of
. decency will detail her private ailments in a strange man s
ear, or suppose him qualified, by a bold brass-plate, to
handle her bare body and deliver her of a child. The
first effect of the female doctor in America and Europe has
been to remind the fair sex of a long-forgotten self-
respect as regards its medical treatment. Women can
no longer say that they have no choice in the sex of their
hired body,scrutineers. The day of the "dear doctor
who could identify embarrassed young matrons—not to
mention blushing maidens—by a mole on the left leg is
waning fast. Men and prostitutes will, save under excep-
tional conditions, be his only patients ere the world is a
quarter of a century older. “ Mixed ” hospitals, of course,
are doomed to become impossible. If the two sexes of
patients shall be admitted to the same institution they
will not both of them provide practice and instruction for
the sex that has run the show hitherto. The spectacle of
a mob of voung men, perspiring from expectation around
the bed of a specialty fine girl, awaiting the arrival of a
learned professor who will presently expose the dainty
morsel to view, is a hospital scandal which must soon be
numbered with prurient medical memories of the past.
Women's diseases, now so prevalent, will disappear to a
great extent, under the timely, intelligent treatment of
women doctors, consulted months, nay years, sooner than
the patient would have been able to bring herself to the
ordeal of an examination by a man. Society is deeply
interested in the multiplication of woman doctors, and
the relegation of male practitioners to their proper sphere.
„ t socl ety, being a slow-witted slave to musty prejudices
moss-grown precedents, doesn’t as yet understand
that the surgeon in petticoats is a bright promise of new
nealth and happiness to domestic life.—E.F.
Judge Murray, during a case at Sydney
Quarter Sessions, administered a well-merited
rebuke to the police for springing evidence on
an accused at the eleventh hour, without notify-
ing defending counsel that such evidence
existed and would be forthcoming. The police
practice is, in all cases, to bring forward just
so little evidence at the lower courts as will
secure a committal, and then, when the c ( ase is
before the higher tribunal, to suddenly produce
what deadly weapons they have kept up their
sleeve. Which is unfair to prisoner and an
affront to J ustice. The public, which wants every
man to have a fair trial, with a view to
securing which it cheerfully foots a big bill
every year, grows weary of the tricks and
dodgeries of the police for securing convictions
—fairly if they can, but in any way to secure
them. When Premier Reid redeems his pro-
mise of recasting the N.S. W. criminal code, the
Democratic members of the House should see
that a Public Defender is appointed. Then
and not till then—will the public get the kind
of justice it hungers for and pays for.
Politically contrast South Australia with
Queensland. Each country had a distinct pro-
gressive democratic policy before it. In S.A.,
that policy was backed by the Kingston Go-
vernment party and the Labor party, and was
opposed by the National Ass and Fat Man.
In Mongrelia, the democratic policy was backed
fully by the Labor party and partly by the
Oppositionist crowd, and was opposed tooth-
and-nail by the Government and Fat Man. In
S.A., the democratic programme triumphed ;
in Leperland, it was trodden under foot.
Now, contrast the two modes of election.
In Kanakaland, the Shark Government worked
the “plural” vote (male Fat and Property v.
male manhood), “ Bulcoeked ” the electoral
rolls, disfranchised thousands of nomadic voters,
rushed the elections a month ahead in order to
prevent other thousands of acknowledged voters
from qualifying by law, and spread the elections
over weeks in order to suit the movements of
the Government wirepullers and of plural-vot-
ing Fat and Proputty. In South Australia,
every adult elector—male and female—had a
chance to vote, and only one, and the elections
were all taken on one and the same day, thus
giving the Government no special advan-
tage. In each case, the existing Government
triumphed, contrary to the experiences of
party-Government. Thus, in S.A., Democracy
and womanhood, with fair play, won the battle ;
in Q., the Government, by foul methods, held
its own. Elections, like horses, “run in all
shapes.”
Hinglish resident critics write with contempt
of the performance—dramatically considered—
of Ambroise Thomas’s “ Hamlet ” at the Scala,
Milan. Ophelia and Gertrude are described
as simpering in garments of late nineteenth-
century cut. The Melancholy Dane resembled
a waxworks figure, and “ the acting of every-
body, from the ghost to the gravediggers, was
an offence to histrionic art.” There is no
occasion for surprise in these rough remarks.
Experience of grand opera and concert enter-
tainments teaches the ordinary, uncranky ob-
server that a talent for music and singing is
commonly associated with bad taste, extreme
personal vanity, and a marked lack of “ gump-
tion ” in the tuneful artist. People who live
by music are the least reason?,ble and most
petty-minded Of all theatrical pros., as any
manager will testify. The men make bizarre
objects of themselves in the public streets, and
take the cake for meretricious mashing.
The women have all the tantrums of
a Bernhardt with very little of Sarah’s
brain-power, and no singer, fiddler, pianist,
&c., or teacher of either sex will readily
admit merit in a rival. In short, the exponents
of music and naught else—leaving rare operatic
“stars’’out of the question—seem to have no
understanding to spare for anything else, even
when they are capable of putting a little soul
into their art, which, as often as not, they don’t.
The sweetest and most fluent warblers, males
especially, are passionless sticks upon the stage
all their lives. They learn nothing, talk
nothing, think nothing but music, music, music,
nor do they improve rapidly in that. There-
fore, when a prophet predicts an Australian
nation of singers, The Bulletin casts an anxi-
ous eye towards Italy, whose emigrating organ-
grinders wear dirty velveteen coats, and brass
rings in their grimy ears, and begins to fear for
the future.
The people who harry Sydney University
authorities to examine for the valuable LL.B.
degree, without obliging candidates to put in a
certificate of haviug attended a specified course
of lectures in the University, rub close to a
subject of genuine and general public import-
ance. Why should not all University degrees
be attainable by examination merely, the ex-
amination to be made comprehensive enough to
meet the practical needs of the various pro-
fessions ? Of course, a University must live,
and Sydney University justifies its demand
that candidates shall listen to its lectures on
the ground that it cannot at present do
without their fees; but this is making
the monetary necessities of an institution
as at present constituted the limit to a
just and honorable public demand. It is of
less general interest that Sydney University
should cease to teach than that it or some other
should assume the duty of national examiner
for all degrees attesting knowledge or con-
ferring influence. Where a man is educated
matters little. He may study law in a second-
hand bookseller’s shop, may master Greek
while a college valet, or be given lessons in
practical surgery for his services as cleaner-up
in a dissecting-room ; he may be educated by a
staff of professors or within his own. family
circle, under denominational auspices or amid
atheistic surroundings ; but if his knowledge is
wide enough and deep enough for a degree the
University of the nation should confer it on
him, without any question as to whether he ate
University dinners, paid University fees, or
played the fool at University commemorations.
Hence the agitation to throw open, as it were,
the LL.B. degree merely introduces the public
to what is a large and rapidly-growing national
requirement.
N.S. W. Registrar Henry suspended a bank-
rupt’s certificate last week because, inter alia ,
bankrupt had incurred debts without “ reason-
able or probable expectation of being able to
meet the obligations.” Bankrupt was a land-
owner, whose property had deteriorated in value,
and in his affidavit he protested that when he
incurred the debts he had substantial hopes
that land would recover its market-value in
time to enable him to meet his creditors in
full. This the Registrar ruled to be “not a
reasonable or probable expectation.” In other
words, reliance on a revival of the land-values
of a few years ago is, according to Mr.
Henry, a contravention of the Bankruptcy
Act in the same sense as would be reliance on
winning the first horse in a racing sweep.
A recent number of an English law magazine
contains an article dealing with the evils which
result when judges retain their offices, although
through age or ill-health they are really unfit
for work. A copy of this article might, with
good effect, be circulated among the occupants
of our own Supreme Court bench. N.S. Wales
has seven Judges ; but, of those, two are away
on leave, and of the remainder two are, sad to
say, in a very poor state of health. The con-
sequence is that work has become very
congested. Cases appear in the lists often for
months before they can* be heard and
disposed of. Litigants are put to enormous ex-
pense each term in collecting witnesses and pre-
paring for their cases, only to find that they
have to stand over. It is a most mistaken
sense of duty which prevents a Judge from
resigning and taking his pension when he feels
that he is really not well enough to cope with
the work. One of the Judges, now in England,
recently attempted to resume his work. He
sat for about a week, during the whole of which
time it was apparent that he was suffering great
pain. This martyrdom was quite unnecessary.
A Judge is not called upon to do the Spartan
Boy business. The public will not grudge a
pension, being more than compensated by the
advantages which accrue from the appointment
of a stronger and younger man.
John Haynes, M.P., threatens to smash some-
thing if the Reid Govt, does not give him an
opportunity of rescinding the hateful income-
tax in the course of next session or as early as
business will permit. There is a chance that
the opportunity will be afforded, for the soul of
Single-tax still breathes in the N.S.W. Pre-
mier’s parliamentary tail, but the Government
must perforce refuse its sympathy, as if income-
tax went another penny would have to be clapped
on the land, or a slice of Dibbs-Protection be
brought back. Reid and Carruthers have
already sworn off, so far as an addition to land
tax is concerned, and the whole Ministry, except
perhaps Young and Garrard, who were never
fiscally coherent, must fight to the death against
the old'* enemy. But yet many will support
Samson Haynes. There is plenty of argument
on his side, and he will be able to absolutely
sail about on a bottomless sea of mercantile
and trading sympathy. He will feel an urban
and suburban population buoying him up, but
how he will satisfactorily explain it all to his
farmer constituents is another question. “ You
may tax the farmer’s land,” said Walpole
once ; “he is a sheep, and Government can
shear him without a murmur. But the trader
in the town is a boar, and if by ineome-tax you
try to take a bristle from his back he’ll yell so
as to awake the country.”
The next politician who proposes to do some-
thing towards simplifying the law should
seriously consider the case of Rigg v. the
Standard Bank, which has dragged on for over
a year in Melbourne. Rigg and others had a
claim on the bank, and after a long, weary, ex-
pensive trial they gained a verdict. Then an
appeal was lodged, and the parties waited
about twelve months for a hearing. In the
appeal the bank pointed out that the names of
certain other people indirectly interested
should also have been inserted as plaintiffs,
and because they weren’t inserted the Full
Court held that all the time and money
and parchment were wasted, and the
proceedings must start again de novo, and
everything except the ruinous co.sts was
just as before. The omission of the names of
these other people w'asn’t even alleged to make
any difference in the facts or the evidence. The
people themselves offered to come into the case
as it stood, and abide by the decision of the
Court on the other points of appeal, instead of
going over exactly the same evidence again
from the beginning, but the law decided in the
sacred name of Costs that this couldn’t be
allowed. So plaintiff is ordered to pay his
own costs and the bank’s costs, and start the
case and the costs all over again on a technical
point, which has no bearing whatever on the
merits of the dispute.
The Old Pioneers’ luncheon in connection with
Melb. Eight-Hours festivities was a pitiful exhi-
bition of the direful effects of decay. Almost
rebels in their youth, certainly fearless and inso-
lent fighters for a great principle, these pioneers
of one little triumph have in their old age
deteriorated into a coterie of slimy grovellers at
the shrines of Respectability, Law’norder, and
Royalty. The toast of the Queen, even in
the Fattest of Tory circles, is gulped down
without comment, yet the hoary presi-
dent of the show could not permit the
swill to pass without ten minutes of ful-
some laudation of the British throne. Gov.
Brassey’s health elicited another unholy crawl,
and the remaining toasts were all more or less
wandered from to put in a good word for the
Pimperial connection or the Royal Family. The
one comic note of the whole show was struck
by one W. E. Murphy, who has just published
a book, and who took the opportunity to adver-
tise the fact m a long speech. Later on the
same Murphy bowed down before Gov.
Brassey under the exhibition dome and im-
plored his acceptance of an edition de Luxe of
the immortal work, gilt-edged and jewelled in
every hole. Altogether, the portion of the
Eight Hours show as conducted by the pioneers,
tempered by Murphy, was a disgusting spec-
tacle to every decent Democrat.
An apparent attempt to introduce the French
system of inquisition before trial was revealed
during the evidence before the coroner in the
M'Carthy murder case at Ballarat. Detective
Wardley was cross-examined as to the means
taken to get a statement from prisoner. He
explained that an information was sworn against
her for vagrancy several days after her arrest
for murder in order that she could be got out of
gaol and questioned by Detective Cawsey and
himself. The magistrate’s order was the only
justification for this proceeding. She was kept
at the detective office for two hours, while
attempts were made to get her to explain her
movements on the day of the murder. This
course was taken because there were special
orders against her being questioned in gaol.
Well might counsel say with reference to this :
“ The police seemed to have got their theory
first and fitted in the evidence afterwards.”
When the detective was asked how he justified
arresting her for vagrancy, he coolly replied :
“ She was got out of gaol that she might ex-
plain her conduct. It was an absolute necessity
to do so.” The woman was acquitted by the
coroner’s jury, but the Crown has since filed a
presentment. There used to be a branch of the
law of contempt dealing with abuses of the
process of the court. Here is surely a good
instance of such an abuse, if the law is alive
still. The means taken to procure this evidence
should prove a standing warning to the other
provinces not to follow in Maoriland’s footsteps
in extending the admissibility of statements
extracted or extorted by detectives.
The letter of Col. Bell, U.S. Consul-General
in Sydney, to the Chicago Times-Heraed,
which has been extensively quoted from and
condensed in local papers, merely expands a
well-known old Chicagoan sentiment when it
directs attention to trade possibilities with
“ countries bordering the great Pacific.” Over
a year ago, at the annual Thomas Jefferson
glorification by the Iroquois Club, Judge Shep-
hard (as reported by this very Times-Herald)
said :
For the future prosperity of this land (Yankeeland), I
would rather court the trade of Japan and China than
that of Europe. Our course of supremacy in trade tends
towards them instead of eastward. In the possibilities of
the future, I would rather have Hawaii for America than
Gibraltar.
However, Col. Bell has expanded the Chica-
goan sentiment by drawing special attention to
Australia as a happy hunting-ground for the
hog-pedlar, and the Foreign-trade press has
accorded him an effusive vote of thanks accord-
ingly. Col. Bell’s complaint is that Chicago
hams go to Hingland and are there rehandled
and transhipped to Australia as Hinglish ’ams ;
but that they don’t come to Australia direct.
This paper’s complaint is that Australia can
grow its own hams; and a similar remark
applies to the Kernel’s attempted Yankee boot
boom.
That estimable Fat Man organ, the Austra-
lian Star, starts out, in the interest of the
private trustee, to prove that a Public Trust
Office is a failure :
The N.Z. Government boast that if they possess one
department more than any other calculated to soothe a
man’s path to the tomb, and keep him jocose when the
spring flowers wave above him, that department is the
—Public Trust. All a person has to do in New Zealand is
to die —the Public Trust does the rest. You just'put a
penny into Death’s slot, and there you are ! The Trust
winds up your estate and invests the money. And you
chuckle as you lie down below fondly imagining you have
the security of the State. The Kaitangata fund is in the
hands of the Public Trustee. It was thought some of
that fund might be available for relief of the widows and
orphans made by the Brunner tragedy. JBut the Kaitan-
gata fund is sick. It now amounts to £7725 and a build-
ing let at £IOO a year. But on one of the mortgages,
amounting- to £4375, the department expect a loss of
£2OOO. So much for the security of the State and the
State’s investments !
The real fact which the Star ignores is that the
Kaitangata fund was for some time under pri-
vate management before it was handed over to
the Public Trust Office, and that it was the
private trustees who put the money of the
widows and orphans into that ruinous invest-
ment. Since the fund was in the hands of the
Public Trustee there have been no losses, and ij
there were the /rubtic revenue would have made
them ijood! If the Star didn’t know these
facts then its remarks are only ignorance and
incompetence ; if it did know them then they
are something else which need not be specified.
Admiral Bridge, when in Maoriland,
deplored the fact that little advantage had been
taken of the exceptional privileges given to
“colonials ” joining the navy. The Admiral also
complained that “they don’t seem to think the
pay of an able seamen (I s - hd. per day) sufficient. ”
it surprises the very English Admiral that blue-
jackets don’t consider the proffered living w?ge
worth dying for.

The second edition of “ Djin-Djin,” which
was put up last Saturday, is as bright and tuneful
as the first. It has all the old scenery and the old
people and the old legs, only the legs are set to
new dance-music, and a lot of fresh frivolities are
inserted. A song about a bicycle, and one about
an undertaker, and one about a baby that wanted
the moon and felt hurt at not getting it, and a
soft, zephyrous, soul-wail about a cottage by the
sea, where an odor of fish and old sea-weed would
naturally come in at the front door, are among
these new efforts. The general result is all that
oan be desired. In its fresh setting, “ Djin-Djin”
is practically as good as new, and should be capable
of another long run if wanted.

very large affair.

“ Saved From the Sea ” is to be staged at
Sydney Royal on Saturday. The present produc-
tion has enough glare and shock and limelight in
it for another fortnight’s run if things were in
their ordinary condition, but just now competition
is at an awful pitch in Sydney, and managers are
reaching for each other’s scalps with unwonted
ferocity, and the manager who falls behind in the
race will be promptly flattened out by the others
rushing over his trampled form. “ Saved From
the Sea” sounds attractive, anyhow. The name is
vaguely suggestive of the sea-weed, and the prawn,
and the mermaid, and the disappeared coal-ship,
and the bleached skeleton on the raft, and all that
sort of thing, and it seems like a piece that might
draw business.

week, and on Saturday night a four-act pro-
duction called “ In the Queen’s Name ” will make
its first Sydney appearance. On this occasion it is
expected that the British Flag will again have an
opportunity to make a few well-chosen remarks
about itself, and will rise manfully to the occasion.
One day last week the dispute between the
managements of Her Majesty’s and the Royal, re
the copyright of “ Called to Arms,” turned up
again in the law courts, and the Royal won
definitely. Therefore it is generally understood
that A. Woods and B. Holt don’t play in the same
yard now, and that Woods doesn’t allow Holt to
holler in his rain-barrel any longer.
** * *
At Sydney Cri. “ Fedora ” is also doing its
last week—in fact, nearly everything is doing its
last week just now, and Saturday will see a rush
of ne\v dramas that will be simply awful in its
intensity. “ Thoroughbred ” will be B. and B.’s
new attraction, and it is understood to be fun and
horse-farce pure and simple. Meanwhile this
1 taper drops a pearly tear over “Fedora,” which
deserved a longer run and better luck, and many
other things which it somehow didn’t get. It is a
beautifully-finished drama, very well played on
the whole, and, above all, it is true to nature. It
ends just as things almost always do end in this
ugly, mismanaged, disjointed scrag-end of a uni-
verse. So many dramatists have been at work
fixing up happy endings for their characters, or
else making them die in a state of beautiful
resignation, that it is refreshing to come across
one production where the wheels roll cheerfully
on over everybody and everything just as they do
in real life, and the anguish of a woman in a low-
necked dress won’t stop them going round worth a
cent. That kind of drama wants to be encour-
aged because of its truth, but it isn’t. Therefore,
as already mentioned, the B. and B. Co. is going
on Saturday to stage something .awfully funny
about a horse.

“Important business” having taken Harry
Rickards to Melbourne, Sydney Tivoli is at present
in a bereaved condition, but Winton, the ventrilo-
quist, and Alice Leamar are doing their best to
compensate for the loss. The suddenness of
Rickards’s departure has created an impression
in some quarters that he may possibly have gone
over to wallop somebody, or to be best man at
somebody’s wedding, or to collect a bad debt, or
to see a man about a dog ; but these are only con-
jectures. The Music Hall is going on much as
usual; if possible it is even a little more usual
than before.

Fitzgeralds’ Circus and the biggest tent
ever seen in Australia are coming by the Rotokino
from the land of Hinemoa, and open in Sydney
next Thursday (May 7th). The advt. says the
show is ten times larger than it was at its last
appearance, which fact is so overwhelming as to
make comment practically impossible.
** * *
“ The Work Girl ” continues to beard the
sweater in his den at Melbourne Royal, although
the prevailing demand for that slop-made melo-
drama is not very brisk. A Jennie Lee, or Polly
Emery, or an Emma Chambers in the name-part
might have helped the show along considerably,
but the crude methods of Miss Florrie Forde don’t
assist it much. A sense of something wanting is
wafted over the footlights by Miss Forde, even
when she heads an insurrection at the mantle-
factory, and captures a pair of pants from the
enemy. She has no acting-resources to fall back
upon in times of need, and the fat that falls to her
share is treated in a way that makes it appear
thin, whereas a more experienced stage-business
lady would fry the tit-bits in oil, so to
speak, and enhance their native greasiness.
However, these sins of omission are felt
rather than observed, and cheerful Florrie
is popular enough. “The Work Girl’s” most
palpable defect is the want of a noble young
hero with a strong right arm, who would lay down
his life for an orthodox sweetheart, if necessary.
Scot Inglis is the nearest approach to a hero, but
he becomes a weary white-haired widower after
the first act, the only object of his affections being
a long-lost daughter, and the daughter forfeits all
claim to public sympathy by falling a victim to an
empty-headed Edgar. No interest attaches to
Edgar, or the girl he has betrayed, or the father
who swears to avenge her wrongs. Plimmer
seems to be first favorite when the curtain falls,
and Plimmer, at the best, is merely a dissolute,
unshaven person who turns Queen’s evidence
because a cleaner and more respectable villain has
stabbed him in the back.

The fourth week of “Trilby” finds that
weird, attractive entertainment proceeding with
undiminished vigor. It fills the Princess’s every
evening, and supports a matinee on Saturdays.
In some respects the performance improves, in
other respects it is none the better for having
gained confidence since the first week. Two or
three of the male characters assert themselves
more than they did at the beginning, and their
extra emphasis grates upon the ear. Little Billee
is the worst of these offenders. The Bulletin
can’t blame Billee for wishing to make a splash,
but the fact that he means well in this matter
doesn’t lessen the effect of his grievous error. The
duty of some actors is to keep their histrionic
powers chained up as much as possible.

Uncle Tom and dear little Eva are still
discussing the rudiments of Christian faith at
Melb. Alexandra. Probably they will sing hymns
together on the old plantation for another week.
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” noivadays, is largely a
variety show, interspersed with pantomime and
slave-traffic ; there are more “ breaks ” in its dark
cloud of sorrow than formerly, and the niggers, as
a rule, appear to wax fat on ill-treatment. Dan.
Barry’s darkies are frequently rotund and seldom
cast down, or, if they get cast down, they often
manage to retaliate by upsetting the brutal over-
seer. Consequently, the boast that Britons never
will be slaves is losing much of its early force, in-
asmuch as the average slave at the Haleck would
rather bleed to death in a cotton-field than change
places with a member of Hingland’s Submerged
Tenth.

The arrival from Sydney of La Belle Maie,
the pretty little wire-dancer, is a popular event at
Melb. Opera House, where Charles Godfrey will
take an afternoon benefit next Wednesday, pre-
vious to making a farewell appearance in the even-
ing. One William Crackles is announced as the
coming comedian engaged to fill the gap.

Mesmerist Kennedy, whose instant sup-
pression would be a gain to humanity at large,
will reproduce his nasty show at Melb. Athenaeum
Hall next week, Providence permitting. Since
the Svengali-Trilby case has been cited as an ex-
cuse for Kennedy it were well to remember that
the Hebrew musician doesn’t debase his subjects
intellectually, or afflict their insides with horrible
compounds. Svengali gives them the benefit of
his genius at the cost of his life. Now, if the pon-
derous hanky-panky man, with the unpleasant
voice, would produce a miraculous singer and die,
The Bulletin might begin to think kindly of
him.

“ The German Court Singers ” are to ap-
pear at Melb. Town Hall on Thursday (30th) and
thereafter, supported by Professor Marshall Hall
in charge of the orchestra, and Madame Wieder-
mann. A question is raised as to whether the
Professor’s occasional association with show specs,
ought to be encouraged. By virtue of his £ 1000 a
year for filling the Chair of Music this intolerant
faddist has started a Conservatorium of Music,
which cuts into the trade of unsubsidised teachers,
and on the strength of their Conservatorium posi-
tion the Professor and his colleague, Madame
Wiedermann, have seemingly arranged the enter-
tainment under notice. Madame W.’s worn voice
is billed as “ honorary,” but the Professor doesn’t
publicly put in a claim to be working gratis.
** * *
When Fitzgeralds’ Circus opened at
Burnie, Tas., the other night, before a big audience,
it was announced that a difficulty in the way of
Prof. Peart doing his high-dive act was the fact
that there was but 20in. water in the tank. When
the professor was ready Dan Fitzgerald said he
would leave Peart to decide when on the platform.
There were many calls from the audience to come
down and not risk his life, but Peart said he had
never been known to come down off the platform
the same way as he went up, and as hundreds had
come many miles to witness his feat he would try
it and believed he would succeed. He emerged
smiling amid great enthusiasm, having made the
world’s record dive—sBft. in 20in. water.

The “ Trilby ” company will not appear
in any other piece, luckily for those gushing critics
who regard a capable performance of an easy
character as a striking proof of genius—in a new
actor. The “Trilby” people—notably Reuben
Fax, Morrison, and Hubert Carr—start with the
advantage of being able to realise Du Maurier’s
pictures of his literary creations. Their parts are
fitted to them. Morrison, as Gecko, is the most
striking case in point. Everyone acquainted with
the illustration in the novel accepts him as the
genuine Gecko before he opens his mouth. For
the rest, he is required to be very dazed and
reproachful, and to speak with a dramatically
“ foreign ” a-ccent. In the third act he has to
shake his wig a bit and get excited, under cir-
cumstances calculated to make him a favorite ivith
the audience. Mr. Morrison’s burst of excite-
ment is, in truth, not nearly as effective as it
might be, although it is generally praised to the
skies. He is a successful Gecko. He does very
well—but he has a very soft thing ne S T^Uby

Cockaigne: “Re the death of Boucicault’s eldest
brother, through an English railway accident. The cir
cumstances involved a strange play within a pla.v. It was
the last night of Boucicault, senior, at Drury Lane, in the
> Shaughraun,’ and, as usual, he had his manager,
Chatterton, up in arms. Boucicault meant to deliver a
claptrap speech on the Irish Question, and Chatterton
managed to foil him. Yet Chatterton had laid aside all
anger, which was merged in pity. During the first act ot
the play, he heard of the fatal accident to young Bquci-
cault, but sedulously kept it from the ears of the droll
Shaughraun and quizzical Moya—Mrs. Boucicault until
the curtain dropped on the fifth act.” „
Svengali Fax was manager Kaw in the original “Trilby
production, and understudy for Wilton Lackaye. He
got a show to play Svengali one afternoon when Beerbohin
Tree was present, and the latter admits having modelled
his Jew on Fax’s impersonation.
“Dot” Boucicault has a mummer-brother, Aubrey, in
the States, where for years he has been playing a round of
parts, from Shakespeare to comic opera. He trades more
on an attractive personal appearance than on any' great
ability as an actor, being described as superficial, careless,
and irresponsible generally.
There are three members of the “ Trilby ” co. —perhaps
the three most artistic—who, The Bulletin' hears, would
like to stay awhile in Australia : Trader, Morrison, ami
Jennie Reiffarth, the Zou Zou, Gecko, and Madame Vinard
respectively of the “ Trilby ” production. Brough might
find room for Trader, Rignold would have a good man in
Morrison, and Jennie Reiffarth would be invaluable in the
Comic Opera Co., as she has been singing in opera for
many years.
Mrs. Potter and Curly Bellew, who open their Australian
tour at Melb. Princess’s in about a month with “ As You
Like It,” bring a few ’Murkan mummers along to fill lead-
ing parts. The rest will be local—veteran Cathcart among
the number.
Jennie Reiffarth, the “mother” of the “Trilby” co.,
has played with both J. C. Williamson and Rignold in
’Murka - with the former in “Struck Oil,” and with the
latter in “ Henry V.”—l7 years ago.
The paintings shown on the Princess’s stage during the
studio scene of “Trilby'” are the work of Miss Portia
Geach, sister of Mesmerist Kennedy’s manager. This is
the lady who rode'manwise 500 miles through the Gipps-
land bush. The charcoal drawings in the studio repre-
sent some of the best known Melb. nude models, and are
the work of National Gallery students.
Melb. University students missed a point in their pro-
duction of Aristophanes’ pla.v, “The Birds,” by not
localising it and bringing it up to date with Old Bird, the
J.P. of Lormer Board notoriety, as principal funny man.
The piece would then have run for three weeks to crowded
houses.
E. D. Davies, who suicided at Esperance last week, was
about the oldest professional ventriloquist, pure and
simple, on record. He had lost a good deal of his youth
when be appeared at the earliest London music ’alls, and
was reckoned a marvel. Ventriloquism has developed
considerably since Davies entered into the business.
In London, the other day, an actress who sued a country
manager for damages sustained by being tripped on the
stage (the case was contested on the ground that the
alleged damage was only imaginary), won her suit by
showing a Rontgen photo., evidencing a displacement of
one of the small bones.
There was to be a notable performance at London
Criterion to celebrate the 20th year of Wyndham’s
tenancy. First an act of “ Money,” with the Bancrofts as
Dudley Smooth and Mrs. Franklin respectively, Beerbohm
Tree as Evelyn, and his wife as Clara Douglas. Then
“ School for Scandal,” with this great cast William
Farren, Sir Peter Teazle ; Forbes Robertson, Joseph
Surface; Wyndham, Charles Surface; H. H. Vincent
(once with “the Firm”), Oliver Surface; Cyril Maude
Sir Benjamin Backbite ; Crabtree, Tom Thorne; Teddy
Righton, Moses ; Weedon Grossmith, Snake ; Fred Kerr,
Trip ; George Alexander, Careless. Fir Harry Bumper
was to be played by William Terriss ; Sir Toby by Arthur
Bouchier; Mrs. Candour by Rose Leclerq ; Lady Sneer-
well by Miss Milward ; Maria by Mary Moore ; and, finally
the Lady Teazle was to be Mrs. Patrick Campbell. The
like of such a cast has seldom been seen before.
The charming Trilby Crane has now gained her point
with “ the Firm ” and wears natural flowers. But it is
said she has to accept responsibility re accidents from
scattered leaves.
An irritating feature of the exponents of Taffy, the
Laird, and Billee is the lackadaisical manner in which
they address the bootless heroine. Any sensible girl like
Trilby would have assaulted with a frying-pan a meaty
Bohemian who addressed her as if she were a puling infant
afflicted with measles. Murkan stage sentimentalism is
S ?,T< mawklsh outside of its own country, and
Taffy and Co., as represented in the visiting “ Trilby ”
Co., are not three British artists, but three actors from the
States. This fact obtrudes itself.

Avrovos the B. and B. production of “The Importance
of Being Earnest,” critic William Archer calls the play
« an iridescent filament of fantasy, grateful and comfort-

artist’s fingers runs with crisp irresponsibility up and
down the keyboard of life.”

Pro. : “ I was one of the audience up-country (N.S.W.)
when ‘The Shaughraun ’ was played with six people.
One man essayed five parts, and only objected to his work
when, in .one important scene, two of his impersonations
had to converse. The same night the leading |&dy took
ill half-way through, and the last act was played without
a Clare Ffolliot. Yet “bush-whackers” wonder why
they have to walk back to Sydney.
Pro. : “ Apropos your remarks re pirate plays : from
half-a-dozen men in Sydney I can get “scrips” of
nearly every play produced in London, New York or the
colonies. That is, of course, plays of any value. It
would pay the holders of rights to have a detective watch
some of the travelling co.’s. Many of these barn-storm-
ing troupes simply alter the name of a play, others don’t
even take that trouble. And the murderings of the
pieces—Ugh ! ”
A recent Sketch devotes a page and a-half to an inter-
view with J. C. Williamson, and a column notice of Harry
Musgrove. J. C. says “ the Firm ” has made most money
out of comic opera.

Fergus Hume’s farcical comedy, “ The Fool of the
Family,” ran for about the shortest time on record—two
consecutive nights. Then it was “reluctantly with-
drawn,” and handed hack to the author along with the
management’s deepest curse.
Max O’Rell has blossomed as a playwright, a farcical
comedy of his called “John Bull on the Continong”
having been played in Canada.
A composer attributes his recent insolvency to “an

lii one respect the S.A. general election
just concluded was very different from its prede-
cessors. The last Parliament amended the elec-
toral law by making it an illegal practice to publish
posters, circulars, or advts. attacking the charac-
ters of candidates without the name of the person
authorising such publication being attached. This
has resulted in the abolition of one of the brightest
features of the old election days, when it was cus-
tomary to circulate at the eleventh hour posters
suggesting that candidate Smith had been living
in adultery with another man’s wife, and asking
the electors if such conduct was worthy of a local-
preacher ? Another wholesome amendment of the
law is the provision for a statement by candidates
of their election expenses—now limited to <£loo
for every 2000 electors on the roll.
The death of ex-Premier Parkes arose
from heart-failure following on pneumonia. For
several days the medical men in attendance on
the veteran had considered his case well-nigh hope-
less, owing to a recurrence of the cardiac weakness
which so markedly showed itself when he broke
his leg some years ago. The boi>des,sly-improvi-
dent old man made no will, having nothing to
dispose of—there were but a few shillings in the
house when he died. The only legacy he will leave
his wife are six children, still young, by a former
marriage. There can be no doubt that provision for
the maintenance and education of these children
will be made by Parliament, failing immediate ade-
quate private action in the matter; for Parkes
so long, with the consent of the people, occupied
the position of head of the State in N.S. Wales
that it would be ignoble and even disgraceful to
leave his children to the uncertain care of inter-
mittent charity. The Bulletin hopes to see a
resolution on the subject submitted by Govern-
ment at the opening of Parliament.
That excised portion of Bird, ex-J.P.’s
published letter to the Vic. Solicitor-General was
as follows :
And now I must refer to a matter I wish I could leave
unsaid. Judge Williams should first have pulled that
beam out of his judicial optic and then he would have
seen clearly to pull the motes —and they were only motes,
for from faults there are none of us free —out of my, then,
magisterial peepers. As soon as I mentioned that I
hailed from Cork, where the honorable and learned Chief
Justice also hails from, it had the same effect on the
Judge (Williams) as holding up a red rag to a bull in a
paddock has. His demeanor towards me instantly
changed ; he became petulant, and when opportunity
offered exhibited a bias against me. A Judge who did
write such a fiercely malevolent letter in the Argus of 9th
as Judge Williams did against the learned
f I have no faith in until he practises some
of that moral courage which he preaches in what Manning
calls the “ garish day bright ruling his wile,” bv publicly
withdrawing that letter and apologising fpr having
written it. Although the season is Easter-tide, immola-
tion of a Cork honorary magistrate upon the altar of his
country can never atone for the wrong done to a Cork
Chief Justice, for two wrongs never did nor never will
make one right.—l am, &c., George Bird.
Lovely idea : the two gintlemen from Cork!

The balance-sheet of the Colonial Bank (Mel-
bourne) is about the most disappointing document of its
kind issued since ’93. It sets forth that the net profits for
the half-year are £2564, as compared with £7BO for last
half-year (when the reduction of interest was only par-
tially effected), with a loss of £4694 for the half ended
March, ’95 (when the 4J, per cent, rate still prevailed), and
a profit of £2246 for the half ended September, ’94. The
situation, consequently, pans out as follows : The Colonial
has £1,597,354 of deferred deposits. The interest on these
has just been reduced from 4}4 to 2U per cent., which
means a saving of £15,973 for the halbyear. Yet, com-
pared with the results for the last half-vear at the old
rate, the concern is only £7258 better oft, and £2300 of
this is gained by cutting down working-expenses;
so, by its own showing, the Colonial’s business has
depreciated so much that over £B7OO of the saving
made off the reconstructed depositors has already van-
ished, and onlj r hard economy kept the vanishment from
being £ll,OOO. Six months more of deterioration at
the same rate would leave the institution with another
big loss to faoe, despite the reduction of deposit-interest.
It is to be hoped that bottom has been reached ?
The Colonial Bank’s old deposit money now
amounts altogether to £1,901,398. Of this £304,044 has
been converted into preference shares which at present
receive no dividend ; the balance carries 2| per cent., so
the rate all round is only £2 2s. 2d. per cent. Yet even
though it gets the bulk of its funds at this amazingly low
rate the Colonial does little more than pay working ex-
penses ; its profits only represent 12s. and an odd copper
or two per cent per annum. The Colonial, like two other
banks, is waiting for an amendment of the Companies
Act to enable it to write off lost capital and
formally reveal to the public its actual position. If a
bank that has written off its losses and got
into a sound position should pay 5 per cent, dividends—
which doesn’t seem unreasonable when the bulk of its
deposits only cost 2£ per cent. —and the Colonial proposes
to get to this destination, it will have to write off, on the
present basis of its affairs, £740,000—a1l its paid-up
ordinary capital and two-thirds of the preference capital.
The current business seems to have somewhat improved
and the available cash (£506,000) is equal to 21 per cent,
of the liabilities to the public, which is a considerable
improvement on previous figures. Otherwise affairs look
none too rosy.

Commercial Bank of Aus. preference shares

Colonial preference (£9 15s. paid) were at 715., whereas last

to account for either movement, so evidently the “ resto-
ration of confidence ” is doing it.

The Riverina Frozen * Meat Co., a Melbourne
concern now only in its second year, shows a profit of
£1420, equal to over 7 per cent, on its small capital of
£19,551. This is after paying £383 preliminary expenses,
carrying £l5OO to a reserve for depreciation, and paying
£1293 Interest on a £lO,OOO overdraft, and £15,000 worth
of debentures. The Riverina F.M. Co. is staggering
along under the burden of a great deal too much bor-
rowed money in proportion to capital, and it needs to go
very slow indeed in the matter of dividends until this
burden is lifted. If it does this its prospects look first-
rate.

The first Vic. beet sugar co. is being formed at
Maffra. It is to treat 30,000 to 40,000 tons of beet per
annum, which should mean 4000 to 5000 tons of sugar.
This will supply one-tenth of the local consumption, so it
is at least a good beginning for the new industry. The
State assists the enterprise with a loan of £50,000 at 4
per cent., repayable by instalments spread over 24 years,
and the infuriated importer calls this aid “coddling” and
“ grandmotherly legislation,” and other unpleasant names
which don’t matter to anybody.

Two new English banks — the Bank of Western
Australia and the London and Western Australian Bank
—have been registered, with a view to the further ex-
ploitation of this suffering country. Australia was badly
over-banked a little while ago, but if the Mercantile,
Federal, and City of Melb. have only dropped out to make
room for some more foreign institutions, the result is a
loss instead of a gain. An absentee-tax which will strike
the absentee bank along with the rest is much needed.

The latest statement of accounts re the Cheviot
estate, that allegedly disastrous speculation of the Maori-
land-Govt., shows thatthe amount which the State has in-
vested in the property is now £274,000, and the rents from
small settlers are £13,379 a year, equal to a little over
£4 17s. per cent, per annum. As the Govt, raised the
purchase money at about £4 6s. per cent, the result shows
that the Seddon Ministry has its head distinctly screwed
on the right way.

Tooth’s Brewery Co. (Sydney) has made £44,568
out of beer during the last six months. It pays a div. at
the rate of 7 per cent, per annum (£31,500) ; adds £6OOO
to reserve, making it £60,000;. £2OOO to depreciation
account; and adds the rest to the balance carried for-
ward, making it £8614. What is the good of preaching
the great Cold Tea gospel in the face of such figures ?

The reconstruction scheme of Carlton and West
End Brewery, Limited (Melb.), doesn’t look like eventuat-
ing. To an outsider, any scheme for converting unsale-
able call-bearing shares into new shares with a lighter
sword of Damocles attached, would seem to be a boon,
especially at a time when the ordinary speculator is
deafened with calls. Certain ungrateful shareholders,
however, spurn the benefits sought to be shed upon them.
Meanwhile, certain institutions interested to £750,000
are praying that it may please Providence to paralyse or
“ take home” the arch-objector, and that at the earliest
possible moment.
Speaking of brewers and brewing in Victoria.
Out of every one of the many breweries that have gone
bung as limited co.’s or are in a dubious condition, the
original proprietors made either competencies or hand-
some fortunes. “ Limited ”in re breweries seems to indi-
cate the length of career. At the present moment, there
are not more than two actually prosperous Ltd. breweries
—of any importance—in Melb., but it is noteworthy that
several small concerns, making a specialty of sound,
drinkable beer, are gradually getting good foothold. This
could not have been possible five or six years ago, for the
reason that all the big Ld. breweries were permitted by
the banks to advance almost anything they liked on any-
thing the breweries chose : hence the competition among
bank-supported breweries to secure “ tied ” houses not
only inflated the values of such properties inordinately,
but shut out the little men whose only merit was good
beer. It only required two or three years’ industrial de-
psession to convince the “ tied ” customers that they had
paid ruinous premiums for the title of landlord. The
result is the “ writing-off” of millions by Melb. breweries.
Ine writer predicts that “ lease, license and good-will ”
will cease to have a commercial value within the next five
years, except in cases where the position of the hotel is in
itself a big thing.
Some 570 respectable individuals, who had a bit
to invest in the “ good old boom ” days, were reminded by
Justice Holroyd last week of the evils of drink, especially
beer. lor this admonition his Honor charged them ss.
.? r .i? s^'are . they held in “The Victoria Brewing,
Malting and Distilling Co. Ltd. (in Liquidation).” The
expense of writing and printing the name of the co. alone
would ruin any concern outside Rothschilds.
Aitkcin, the original proprietor, made a pile ; the
Nations, his successors, also did well at it, and sold the
concern to abovenamed limited co., £255,000 capital. A
short career and the co’s bankers sat down heavily.
Some 12 months ago the co’s late bankers sold the con-
cern in London, taking part cash and part debentures.
The London co. proposed to knock sheol out of all the
other local breweries (lager and tanglefoot) by erecting
new machinery and adding largely to the premises. They
also planked down a good stiff sum, but a hitch arises
now.

This present resurrection of Jimmy Mirams and
his building society dealings ought to be considered
together with a certain abortive scheme for getting
Mirams whitewashed by the Vic. Assembly at the moment
when a prosecution of Matthew Davies was impending.
Several friends of Mirams and Davies—as The Bulletin
doesn’t forget—were anxious to pose him in a martyr
a-ttitude before the J. B. Patterson Parliament. The
libel-action now raging in Melb. County Court will show
the exact amount of sympathy due to Mirams, whose
“ barrackers ” of three years ago included James Service
and Alfred Deakin. Therefore, the political honesty of
Service and Deakin is almost as much upon its trial as the
Argus, seeing that the newspaper denies the possibility
of intelligent belief in Mirams’s cause. .
* * * *
Amusing to compare reports of Mirams v. the
Argus in the two Melbourne morning journals. The Age,
as of yore, shows no enthusiasm for revelations touching
the cruel fate of the Premier Building Association’s funds.
It doesn’t mention that a certain newspaper proprietor
was one of the original trustees, and it omitted to print
Puryes’s exhaustive narrative of the scandalous land jobs
carried through by a relative of that newspaper man’s
and the precious Murphy family.

The Govt. re-valuation of station properties in
north-western N.S. Wales has resulted in a reduction of
rent of something like 50 per cent. If the re-valuation in
other parts of the province comes out on anything like
the same basis it will mean that there has been a pretty
general fall of at least 25 per cent. Supposing this to
happen, and it seems quite probable, will certain banks
which hold enormous areas of squatting property keep
them standing in their books at the old figures, or write
them down to present values? If they do the latter,
what will happen to them now? And if they don’t, what
may happen to them later on ?

One peculiar feature of the Sydney boot-trade
dispute. Masters usually prefer piece w ork as a guarantee
that a full equivalent for wages paid is obtained, and
object to time-payments because money may pass for
work not done. In this instance it is the men that prefer
piece-work —evidently because a fair return for work done
is larger than what the masters wish to pay per day for
the same amount of work.

Hearken to a summary of “a representative
colliery proprietor’s ” views of the situation in the New-
castle (N.S.W.) coal-trade strike : “ Strike can’t last; men
lack resources ; not been provident in the past good
lor ! what had they to be provident with ? —“ A.M.A.
virtually wichout funds ; public sympathy absent; other
trade-unions can’t give sufficient aid ; and every effort
would be made to prevent the granting of credit tr the
strikers.” ! ! ! The law of human existence : If no money,
no food, no credit, and no livable work, then either Go-
vernment must feed, or food must be got by force.

N.S.W. Govt, is moving to re purchase lands
from pastoralists in order to offer them for agri-
cultural settlement. Ashton, M.P., has suggested
that the values stated by squatters in their land-tax
returns should be taken as forming the basis of such re-
purchases. And why not ? What other possible basis can
a logical Government take ? The Bulletin said long ago
that the State should reserve the right of purchase at,
say, 19 per cent, over the owner’s valuation. With that
provision the land-tax would yield a lot more money than
it does, and resumption would be about 80 per cent,
cheaper.

At Drake (N.S.W.) Hynes, a butcher, was
owner of an hotel erected on ground held by business
license and rented to a tenant who refused to pay his rent
and eventually jumped the ground on the plea that a
business license was invalid unless the holder lived on the
ground. Warden Steele decided in favor of Hynes, but
notice of appeal has been given.

New Bushman’s, Parkes (N.S.W.) —645 tons
4050 z. What excuse this time ?
Lone Hand, Bulgandra (N.S.W.) :—“ Since the
mine was opened up 120 tons stone have yielded 4000 z.,
the average being well maintained throughout.” The
fact that the mine has been opened up nearly two years is
not worth mentioning. It is the omissions in N.S.W.
mining that make the writer feel tired.
A party of miners have found a good copper-
lode near Blayney and are sending away 100 tons of high-
grade ore. It is on private property. The N.S.W.
Mining on Private Property Act, almost unworkable in
any direction, does not apply to copper at all. These men
are burdened with a 10 per cent, royalty.

The mess made at Wyalong by the Mines Dept,
will, it is hoped, never be repeated in N.S.W. Wyalong
was proclaimed a miners’-right field. No leases were
allowed, consequently the place is pegged out in small
areas, averaging about 200 ft. on the line of reef. One
claim measures 17ft. The Dept, allows claim-
holders to change their claims to leases, but not
to take in any additional area whether available
or not and it does not permit of amalgamation of claims
with that view. At Wyalong bigger blocks are as neces-
sary as better titles, and the latter have been given
without the former. The articles recently appearing in
Sydney D.T. give the best description of the field that has
yet appeared. They indicate that in many cases the
veins from which splendid returns have been made will
pass out of these narrow claims at comparatively
shallow depths, and the side-on ground, because of
the early bungling on the part of the Dept., is not
obtainable. Wyalong returns are as follows: Battery
treatment, 7895 tons, 19,4320 z.; average per ton, 2oz.
9J4dwt. Chlorination (ore), 755 tons ; average per ton,
soz. 14>/>dwt. Chlorination (concentrates), 155 tons, 960
oz. ; average per ton, nearly 6oz. 4dwt.
When Wyalong started, nobody knew whether
the gold would “go down ” into the rock, or whether it
would end with the soft surface country. Most of the
experts held that the mullock veins wouldn’t live into
reefs. Consequently, there was a general outcry that the
field should be kept for “ working miners”—and it was.
Consequence : instead of being divided into a dozen big
leases, resting on exemptions and trying to float them-
selves into £lOO,OOO co’s in London, the field has been cut
into 100 profitable little claims, the profits are well divided,
and a big population has been nourished from the start.
Now that it is found many of the reefs improve with
depth, the obvious plan is for adjoining claims to amalga-
mate into leases, take up vacant land alongside, and get
capital to do the sinking on the bettered security. Why
won’t the Mines Dept, permit amalgamation ?

quality. These reports are true. The ore is wide and it

pass into the North (perhaps even into the extreme north-
west corner of the British).

Whispered that the B.H. Proprietary has
acquired a large area of ground on its eastern boundary.
* * * *
Re the proposal of a European co. to take over the
B.H. British mine and smelting-plant—the latter a very
costly piece of machinery—it is just as well to remember
a report called for by Govt, from the Board of Health ex-
perts on lead-poisoning. Dr. Ashburton Thompson, the
officer despatched to make the report, recommended that,
although it was not advisable to insist upon the furnaces
in blast being provided with fume-condensing appliances,
no idle plant should be permitted to restart without such
appliances. The British has been an idle plant for some
time. Meantime, the improvement in the appearance of
the workings continues, though most work is being done
on shallow depths—on the 200 and 100 levels. Along with
the sulphides, the development of carbonates proceeds :
a big dump of the latter is being made at surface. The
concentrating-plant, in the erection of which there has
been exceptional expedition, is now being finished.

Good coal has been found 103 ft. down at
Queensferry, Western Port Bay (Vic.). The co. has 3700
acres, and reckons that there are 22 different outcrops of
coal on the surface of its ground. If the new discovery
proves as big a thing as is imagined, the co., with cheap
water-carriage at its front door, should have a big thing
in hand —if it has sense enough to hang on to it, instead
of selling out to the omnivorous Bull.

Britishers are said to be putting the old Cornish

Trial from the east leg of the reef, cut in the 980 ft. level

from the 1405 ft. level. Maintains this steady average all
the year round. No wonder adjoining co’s are breaking
their necks to get this lode. North Magdala seems to
have got it, and another nine weeks should bring it on

The erratic Collman and Tacchi looks in for its
annual div. turn. Prospecting at the 1645 ft. level has
exposed a 7ft. body of payable stone, 232 loads milling
1490 z. 9dwt. The lode has a permanent appearance, but
then the Collman has so often looked well and gone back
on its backers. Last half the co. paid one div. (£675),
later on asked for it back, and also borrowed £5OO from
Lansell to avoid making another call.

“ As rich specimens as were ever before taken

Burning rivalry exists between Coolgardie and

There has been fierce excitement in Perth (W. A.)
over the reported gold-find in the Darling Ranges, 50
miles distant. As soon as the field began to attract
general attention the ex-editor of a Perth paper, after a brief
inspection, pronounced it a duffer, and alleged that there
was no stone in the district like that shown as coming
from the field. The inference was that persons interested
were trying to work a swindle. The ex-editor soon dis-
covered that he had stirred up a wasp’s nest. The spon-
sors of the field immediately set forth to prove its genuine-
ness. This they did to the satisfaction of the Perth share-
broking-boom people, who loudly called for the head of
the ex-editor on a charger, forgetful of the great ad. he
had given the field. After the boomers had raged for
some days the field was hall-marked, according to the
accepted traditions of Westralia, by the Mayor of Perth
“ receiving ” the discoverers at the Town Hall, whereat
the great men of the Stock Exchange positively proved its
genuineness by drinking its health and the health of its
discoverers and a lot of other healths in champagne.
After which it is time to look for crushings. A good
feature is that there is no talk of “ jewellers’ shops.”
Plenty of stone is promised, and the grade is described in
dwts. The situation of the field is favorable for cheap
working, and a very few dwts., it is claimed, will pay.
T. J. Oashman wires The Bulletin : “Have
been month Dandalup, Darling Range; examined it
thoroughly. No trace of gold in reef. Consider it a rank
duffer, and the greatest wild-cat I have seen in 26 years’
experience.”

The Bulletin has by mail the just - issued
London prospectus of a W.A. mine—capital over £lOO,OOO
—and notices that the show has been reported on by three
people (two ex-Sydneyites and a Melbourne man), two of
whom, to this paper’s certain knowledge, never saw a
mine in their lives (barring potato-mines) until within —to
give a liberal margin—the last 14 months. And yet, so
far as is disclosed by the prospectus, their reports are the
chief reasons adduced to J. Bullion for buying the alleged
show. Knowing those people as this paper does, theii
appearance as mining experts is as ludicrous as would be
the sudden appearance of poor old Paddy the Ram as
coiffeur in a fashionable ladies’ barbery. The smellfulness
of that Westralian boom !
* * * *
Letters to hand from Day Dawn, Cue, and other
places on the Murchison ; from Coolgardie, Hannan’s,
White Feather, and other parts of the Coolgardie fields ;
also from Dundas and the Norseman, all telling the same
story, and all warning men not to come there for work.
If The Bulletin published the letters received every
week in support of the stand it has taken re W.A. boom-
mining, it would have no room for anything else.

Menzies, W.A., has started with two very fair
crushings—Crusoe, 130 tons, 5620 z. ; Friday, 100 tons,
2400 z. Big things have been said of Menzies by big men.
W. R. Wilson, one of the gamest of mining men, swears
by it. The veins are in a formation distinct from Cool-
gardie’s.
* * * *
Bayley’s No. 1 South —140 tons, 2720 z. It has
a big lode in which there are occasional rich pockets. It
has never paid a div., and its two years’ working and
crushing proves it a very low grade concern altogether.
Reputable Barrier manager’s terse comment on
the Junction Consolidated, Adelaide’s latest B.H. float:
“ Not even position to recommend it.”

Croesus Extended. — One paper said .£lO,OOO
deposit had been paid, and that the purchase price was
£26,000 as well as shares; another, that it was £450
deposit. It now transpires that the mine has been placed
under offer till the end of June, and the cash considera-
tion, if the deal comes off, is £3500. The exact amount of
the deposit is still generally unknown. Ten days ago the
shares were Is. 3d. ; they, then, on the strength of fairy-
tales about the sale, jumped to 4s. 6d., and afterwards re-
ceded to 2s. 6d. No comment is necessary.
Great assistance is lent to the wild-cat promoter
by the Westralian system of mining registration, every
lease being given a new number when a transfer is
lodged. Thus, when Gilligan’s Reward South is re-
christened the Rat-Catcher by a new gang the Eastern
and English public have absolutely no means whereby it
can be identified as the magnificent swindle which went
20cwt. road-metal to the ton and so effectually cleaned out
investors. Even those on the field experience the
greatest difficulty in “ placing ” distant blocks, hearsay
being, as a general rule, more reliable than official evi-
dence. The same patch of valueless earth is consequently
sold and resold, perhaps to the same shareholders, without
anybody suspecting that the lease 224,570, over which
they blewed their good gold six months before, is identical
with lease 56,278 now being floated for £150,000 in London.

Britishers have practically diddled the Adelaide
people out of the Lake View. Before mooting the pro-
posal to refloat the co. in London for £250,000 they quietly
mopped up 60,000 out of the 80,000 issue, and could thus
dictate. When the Adelaide directors were inclined to
“ buck ” at the game, the syndicate had the steeled cheek
to tell them, “We have a much higher opinion of the
mine than you have, and we consider that instead of
scratching the surface as you have been doing, you should
develop it, and for that you want better heads and more
capital.” The grabbers’ troubles in developing it. They
are after a big “ cut ” out of the new float. Proposed co.
will have £30,000 working capital, a sum the mine could
amass in no time if shareholders forewent divs. for a short
period. As it is, the co. has £lO,OOO in hand for machinery
purposes.

Charters Towers has five mines whose average

“Probably for all dairy purposes in this
country the Ayrshire cow will be found to be the
best, but care should be taken to change the sire
in a herd at least once in three years,” said Gov.
Hampden at West Maitland (N.S.W.). His Ex-
cellency is clearly “on the job.” He had on

Sydney Daily Telegraph brevity: “Lord
Hampden thinks that the possession of capital is
needed by young Australians who would settle
on the land.” H.E. isn’t quite sure of it, you
will observe, and he only speaks of young Aus-
tralians ; he hasn’t even got so far as thinking
at old or middle-aged Australians would be the

oetter of capital under the same conditions. The
Bulletin is now waiting to hear from Gov. Hamp-
den again when he has beeome quite sure that
young Australians settling on the land need to
have capital. One of the dreadful features about
being a Gov. is that he has to make about four
speeches a week without committing himself on
any burning question, and he is even afraid to be
positive that young men settling on the land re-
quire capital, lest he thereby becomes too much of
a partisan. Almost the only thing he can say
with absolute certainty without stepping out of
his sad. and washy sphere is that there are 1760
yards in a mile.

Gov. Buxton has so far Avoided Adelaide
theatres, and his trip to Sydney was a good excuse
for not attending two big race-meetings in Ade-
laide. Even Lieut.-Gov. Way rarely visits the
theatre, and is never seen on a racecourse. Ade-
laide society, by the way, is already showing signs
of discontent at the exclusiveness of the Govern-
ment House crowd, and the consequent prospects
of a dull winter.

Secretary Wallington has formally parted
from Gov. Brassey, on the basis of a “ handsome
compensation. ” It wasn’t that Brassey had ceased
to love his Wally, or vice versa. Each of them
deeply regretted the “ necessity for a re-arrange-
ment of H.E.’s staff,” whereby the old secretary
is compelled to make way for a new-chum, and
soothe his sorrow with a lump sum. Hon. Ran-
dolph Capel, brother to Lady 8., is to join the
family party presently, and the capable Walling-
ton’s vacant chair will be preserved as a sacred
relic.
* * * *
There are various versions of the climax of
the revolution at Melbourne Govt. House. As
explained some months ago, before there was any
talk of Sec. Wallington leaving, it was impossible
for the pushful Earl Shaftesbury to allow anyone
to occupy a position senior to himself, and as he
began to shove and elbow, Wallington—who had
been used to having things all his own way —turned
“ shirty.”

Captain Wallington has had unique official
experiences since his arrival in Australia. He has
been secretary to Carington, Hopetoun, Mel-

appointment of A.D.C. to Gov. Duff before the
latter’s last illness.

A five-figure will proved in Sydney a
couple of weeks back was that of an Irishman who
died in Ireland, but had spent years in N.S.

A noteworthy feature of the will was that he left
one shilling only to each of 23 members of his
family circle.

“Trilby ” is another
thorn in the cloth of the
Church— i. e., Protestant
Church. Harwood’s per-
formance of the Rev.
Thos. Bagot brings that
unctuous, worldly-min-
ded shepherd into ridi-
cule, and the audience
enjoys the spectacle.
Protestantism, anyway,
is based upon common
sense ; it recognises the
existence of mean, con-
temptible apostles of the
creed, and doesn’t scruple
to grin at their religious
absurdity. But the
R.C.’s ! No British dra-
matic author has yet
ventured to poke borak
at the shaven priest-
hood, except in plays
where the action is dated
ages back. Women re-
fuse to entertain the idea
that they pour confes-
sions, at times, into the
lecherous ear of an im-
pudent hypocrite. Their
faith teaches them to
be suspicious of all men
outside their persuasion,
and mistrustful even of
all Catholics that are
not priests. Hence the
girls are generally vir-
tuous, and the wives
mostly unhappy—apart
from the “ comforts of
religion. ”

The other day the members of the Public

tain Sydney Government department during the
temporary absence of its chief, began to’ask a
subordinate officer some awkward questions con-
cerning the chief aforesaid. He protested : “It’s

similar case the same day he told the Judge that
the accused was stupid, but quite fit to plead, and
that he would understand the proceedings as a

these occurring almost daily, punctuate the de-

phantic dictum of the Judges in M'Naghten’s case

The Maoriland courts are strug-
gling with a tough divorce-case. It
started in a hotel. A Northern
hotel-keeper has a pretty wife, and
among the lodgers in the house was
a gorgeous commercial-agent. The
pub.-owner came back one night after
a few days’ absence and accused his
wife of immorality with the agent,
and the lady straightwav confessed in
writing that it was alftrue. When
the case came into court the agent
called a housemaid who swore that
she slept with her mistress every
night when the old man was away,
and that none of the things alleged
m the lady’s confession ever happened.
His theory is that plaintiff and his
wife found their marriage a fa'ilure
and got up the confession by mutual
consent, and that he was selected as
the co-respondent because he was a
tall, military person of noble appear-
ance, and the lady having to allege
that she was wrongfully clasped to
somebody’s chest chose his as the
best chest available. In other words,
he was made co-respondent because
he is the kind of man that a lady of
good taste might reasonably want to
co-res pond with, and one whom she
might really enjoy swearing that she
co-responded with, even if she didn’t.
Ur, to put it more briefly, he says that
she says he is the co-respondent be-
cause she is very sorry he isn’t. The
case stands adjourned while the law
gets its second wind.

What has happened to a man in N.S.
Wales ! “ Fraudulently alluring from her father’s
residence, with intent to marry her, she being
under the age of 21 ” —is the wording of a charge
on which “ a lovyer so brave ” has been committed
for trial. The girl is 19 a fully developed woman
according to the laws of Nature, which are laws
of God, but an “infant,” a “ minor,”according to
the narrow laws of man. Why, in Queensland,
a girl of 18 may take up a selection, and yet
she cannot marry without her parents’ or her
guardians’ consent, or, if she has no parents or
guardians, without the permission of a magistrate
authorised to consent to the marriage of minors.
Surely a 19-year-old girl should be mistress of her
own movements ? How can she be “ lured
away”? Further, is “intent to marry” a 19-
year-old girl, even without her father’s consent, a
crime ?

In the stage version of “Trilby,” author
Du Maurier has consented to be hoist with his
own petard. Readers of the book will remember
a little incidental dissertation on the absolute
purity of Art. Painters, we are told, agree in
maintaining that “nothing is so as the
nude” and so forth. In the drama laffy hurls
this fine-art doctrine at Mdme. Vinard, who asks
him to lower the studio blinds (out of considera-
tion for the girls employed at the glove-factory
opposite) whenever a model may be posing for the
‘ ‘ altogether. ” Taffy declines with scorn to con-
sider the glove-factory’s prurient blushes. A
moment later Billee rushes -in, horror-stricken, to
tell of how he has just seen Trilby sitting naked
before a roomful of students. Taffy and the
Laird are shocked likewise. Then Mdme. Vinard
points her satirical moral: “To ze pure all things
are pure —no-sing is so chaste as ze nude ! ” The
matron leaves the artists utterly routed. Their
faith in the supreme chastity of nakedness couldn’t
reconcile them to the thought that fifty young
men had just been gloating over the unclothed
figure of the woman they loved.

A Melb. chiropodist tells a Bulletin man:
“ This Trilby business is a perfect God-send. I

podists ought to memorialise him.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Twas all on a fair summer morning,
My love pressed her lips to my mouth,
And passed without shadow of warning
To a city unfamed in the South.
When one speaks of that city, I listen,

I watch when the wind changes southward,
I sleep with my face to the South.

There has been a good deal of discussion lately among
Sydney clergymen as to whether they are liable to pay
income-tax.
The parson who keeps well in view
The words of Christ on other fax,
Is apt to lose sight of the few
Texts relevant to Income-tax.
The parson dear is trying here
To save a weary world from hell;
But “ world,” you know, means all things, so
He’s bound to save his cash as well.
The church in debt, coin hard to get,
Make parsons think their people lax :
Their proper way should be to pray
For coin to pay the Income-tax.
If prayer can gain from heaven the rain,
Why should it not make coin increase ?
And Csesar Reid might then succeed
In raking in his tax in peace.

The most important point for the consideration
of all persons who desire to possess photographs
of those nearest and dearest to them is with regard
to permanence rather than price. No photograph
that will turn yellow, break out in spots, or vanish
into nothingness within a few weeks can have its
value expressed in figures. When delivered, it
may shine like the enamelled mystery on a soap-
box, but the seeds of disease are there, and must
come to the surface. This may be regarded as
one of the certainties of cheap photography at per
dozen.

Sydney, April 28, 1896.
Mv Dear Moorabinda—
Sydney Polo Gymkhana last Saturday at Ken-
sington racecourse must be regarded as one of the
most successful jousts ever held by the club, for
the day was fresh, the lists full, and only one bad-
looking cropper occurred—in the costume - race,
when Dr. Scott concussed with Mr. Paterson and
looked like the “ late Dr. Scott ” for twenty
minutes, but ultimately relieved everybody’s feel-
ings by walking off the course. It was rather hard
on the audience that this serious-looking fall
should have occurred in the farcical “ costume-
race.” Nobody could help grinning at the vulgar
spectacle of Lieut. Taylor got-up as a New
Woman in black and billowy bloomers, scarlet
blouse with big sleeves, golden wig, and sailor hat
with neatly-arranged white chiffon veil, cantering
over to the disaster quite forgetful of his outrage-
ous attire. It recalled a scene I once saw behind
the curtain at a pantomime, when a fainting fairy
was being brought round by two living vegetables
and the hind legs of an elephant.
Next to the costume-race for comicality came
the tandem heats. Some of the chop-tailed little
gee-gees in the lead—anyone who chops a horse’s
tail in Australia should get six months’ hard and
then be transported to Hingland for life—scarcely
seemed to know what was wanted, and conse-
quently the shaft horse forged level with and even
ahead of his leader more often than not. I was
glad to see that one or two polo youths had
humanely left a switch on their mounts, regardless
of its anti-English appearance. The needle-thread-
ing race went off quicker than usual, suggesting
that some of the damsels at the barrier had
supplied themselves with spring needles for the
occasion. By the way, how very domestic it
looks to see the married amateur jockey receiving
the needle from his wedded wife ! One almost
expects to see her utilising the thread to sew a
button on for him when ne returns to scratch.
The musical ride, by members of the Defence
Force, was a pretty spectacle cleverly manoeuvred,
and just circusy enough to be characteristic of
Australian “sojerdom.”
There was an excellent lawn attendance. His
Ex. turned up nursing an umbrella with a golf-
stick handle, and looking much brighter and more
sunburnt than usual. Gazing on fat pigs and
prize pumpkins in various country towns—as Lord
H. has been and is still doing—appears to agree
with the V.R. constitution in all its bearings. I
think, too, that His Ex. ’s genius for mingling with
the silk-petticoated throng and conversing with
the society female in her best hat is likely to keep
his memory green when Jamberoo is the Federal
city. Lady H. wore a grey dress with a white
vest d la seagull, the pink roses in her bonnet
being hardly on kissing terms with her red
famp, and I was also surprised to see that Her
lx. humped her own brown wrap. The private
secretary who wrote about the attributes of Aus-
tralian Governors might now favor the world with
a disquisition on what “suites” are hired for if
not to relieve Madame of all responsibility regard-
ing wraps ? I never saw Lady Jersey carrying
her own waterproof. Miss Brand wore black
crepon on pottery-blue ; with white bib collar and
cuffs and black and white hat.
Society was exhaustively represented on the
lawn. The pretty wife of an Australian Croesus
wore a black coat and skirt with purple silk vest
beaded gorgeously, and a purple toque with black
suggestions, and chaperoned a Sydney belle not
long back from Europe, with apparently some
wild-goose’s feathers stuck in her hat. Sydney’s
best-dressed society woman almost escaped notice
in a sealskin sacque finished off with fur, and
somebody else in pale-heliotrope had nose and lips
en suite, for the wind was high, cruelly revealing
sometimes that society had not pulled up its socks.
There was a great diversity of male attire, from
the white riding-breeches suggestive of flour-bags
to knickerbockers ; one plump youth, by the way,
showed great thrift by the masterly manner m
which he held a half-smoked cigar behind him
what time he shook hands with Lady H. Sydney
cigar-stump hunters must be experiencing evil
times when a man prefers clinging to three inches
of sixpenny smoke to raising his hat to a lady.
The recent contretemps at Perth, W.A., when
Governor Smith omitted to quench the Great Aus-
tralian Thirst of the local soldiers lined upi at his
daughter’s wedding, and has been apologising, per
aide-de-camp, to every big-wig in the barracks
almost ever since—reminds me that when Gov.
Brassey “invited” the Sydney nurses aboard the
Sunbeam the ministering angels were charged six-
pence a head admission, and did not even get a
bun out of it at that. Nor would that have
mattered a row of pins if there had been no re-
freshments at all—only some of the sisters Dora,
peeping through a skylight, saw a society company
revelling in tea and tarts in the saloon while they
starved on deck. Vice-regality should never for-
get that modem Australian “ loyalty ” is largely
a question of eating and drinking. But, apropos
nurses, have you ever remarked that Florence
Nightingale, in her square-shouldered black cloak
narrowing in to the feet, is gruesomely suggestive
of the shape of a coffin ? And I saw one the
other day with a bunch of tuberoses in the front
of her frock—just like the little bouquet the truest
friend of a dead woman sorrowfully places on the
name-plate to conceal the age of the deceased.
# Her many admirers and well-wishers in Austra-
lia will be glad to hear (I have it from London)
that the erstwhile somewhat greaseful Ada Cross-
ley, who promised to be beef to the heels in a few
years’ time (like pretty nearly every other typical
contralto), is fining down in the big smoke, and is
not half so florid of face and generous of outline
as of yore—besides being much slighter in the
figure. At the Lemmone concert, at the Queen’s
Hall, she was very elegantly gotten up in an in-
describable but very smart black-and-gold gown,
which has earned her the expensive reputation of
being the best-dressed woman on the English
concert-platform.
Sydney Y.M.C.A. Hall was, last Wednesday,
the happy hunting-ground of a band of Society
amateurs, who lifted up their voices in aid of the
Home for Working Gentlewomen, before a fashion-
able house headed by Her Ex. in wonga-pigeon
blue brocade, with darker velvet sleeves and cream
chiffon vest, and her hair arranged like an oyster-
pate. Lady H. was in ambush behind a huge
bouquet of multi-colored roses, in which gracious
shelter she yawned almost unperceived, while
Bishop Smith, out in the open, had to try and
make his forty winks look like silent prayer. The
platform was artistically draped in rainbow stuff,
with palms and pampas-grass and huge baskets of
’mums. Perhaps the most soothing thing about
the show was that no flowers found their way up
to the women. The spectacle of a squally she-
vocalist being deluged with herbs by her friends
and near relations only looks as if they were
accentuating their gratitude to her for leaving off.
The chiefest vocalist on the programme was Dr.
Maguire, whose well-cultivated operatic baritone
made the success of the evening with “Eri Tu,”
which gained a big encore, and a cavatina from
“La Traviata ” —Mrs. Maguire, in black satin
and green jet embroidery, contributing an excel-
lent accompaniment. Otherwise the programme
was principally the Hon. Francis Egerton, A.D.C.,
and Mr. D. Hopkins, R.N., private see. to the
Admiral—judging by the applause they got. Capt.
Egerton (fiercely accompanied by Miss Ida Gilles)
sang a love-ditty in a most lady-like manner with
one toe poised like a dancing-master, but, of
course, he was wildly encored, and turned up again
and won the respect of the audience for contri-
buting an encore one verse long—or, I suppose I
ought to say, short—until it leaked out that his
accompanist had to out him off because she
couldn’t play any more of it at sight. The naval
youth picked out his own accompaniments. His
song was comic and sung in a tone that appeared
to be the still small voice of conscience. His
classics were “The tin gee-gee;” a ditty about
the probability of the society girl taking out her
teeth and hanging her golden hair on the gas on
retiring (enthusiastically received) and “ Our
Parents,” which was the cleverest of the batch.
Mr. Hopkins appeared to be a huge success and
turned his end of the Y.M.C.A. into a music-hall.
A respectable old gentleman was heard calling out
(but ineffectually) for more comic songs whenever
the loo’tenant showed signs of leaving off his
Lonnenesque lay. One touch of the Tivoli makes
the whole world kin. A Liszt solo was amusing
because of the labial and other gyrations of the
lady-performer—who made music as a baker
makes dough. Nathless she was applauded.
“ Persons and not performances ” was the general
rule for applause on this occasion.
The wedding of Miss Ethel Turner, the popular
young Australian authoress, and Mr. H. R. Cur-
lewis, a rising Sydney barrister, took place at St.
John’s Church, Gordon, on 22nd inst., in the pre-
sence of a huge wedding-party that completely
swamped the little church, where the decorations
were of white chrysanthemums to match the
bride’s cheeks, becomingly pale for the cere-
mony. The pretty blonde bride wore white
satin and chiffon, and carried a fragrant posy,
and her four maids were alike in cream with
chiffon fixings and straw hats en suite, and carry-
ing bouquets of white and yellow chrysanthemums
and ferns. After the ceremony a reception was
held at Bukyangi, and afternoon tea was served
in a marquee on the lawn, while the handsome
wedding presents were displayed in the dining-
room. After a lively interval of congratulations,
unharassed by set speeches of any kind, Mr. and
Mrs. Curlewis left for their honeymoon, the clever
little bride going away in a grey gown with shot
Eurple ribbons, hat en suite. Mosman's Bay will
e the serious home of the happy, young-looking
pair.
At the gaslight wedding last week of a popular
Sydney medico —who married a nurse, of course, as
nearly all the medicine-men do, propinquity being
one of the chief factors in love—the very pretty
bride almost fainted before the ceremony, and no
wonder. The church was a seething mass of
sightseers who occupied every coign of vantage,
stood on the seats, and blocked the aisles, and it
took all the steering in the world to get the lady
to the altar with her veil in one piece. So un-
seemly was the crush that the minister sharply
lectured the mob on the way they were crowding
the church. I really think weddings should he
held in camera. A mob of strange
and raping round a girl most y 8 P
rf LffiEL the ceremony .v» gar ordeal I
am one with Max Nordau on the .mpropnet^ol
modern marriage rites. And yet, I Ipo >
a police-court point of view, it woul would
marriages contracted altogether sub «wo-it would
give the amorous bigamist too many chances.
Apropos weddings. A well-known Sydneyite
lately went up-country to take unto 1 _
wife, and as everybody in the bush township knew
what he had come for, he was subjected to much
chaff. The day before the wedding he was para-
ding the main street with his best man, when he
all at once became aware that Blankeyville was
convulsed with merriment as one unit. Booking
behind them the spruce pair saw that “e “aker
man was following them up with the gotten g
white wedding-cake on a tray upon his head.
Then that procession became the most depressed
one ever seen since the last man was driven to the
gallows sitting on his own coffin.
Talking of the newly-married—a pair of honey-
mooners were travelling from Sydney by tram
the other day, and, at one of the stations, the
bridegroom left the bride alone for a little while.
Imagine the bride’s flattered feelings (it is every
bride’s ambition to look as little newly-wed as
possible) when up popped the guard and asked
her if she would mind travelling in the ladies
compartment, as he wished to reserve a carriage
for a newly-married couple ? But the lady rose
to the occasion, and diplomatically replied that
she was travelling with a gentleman and could not
very well take him into a ladies’ carriage ! But,
mind you, that hoodwinking reply was only
possible with a bride conscious of having no rice in
her hat-brim.
A suburban female ‘ ‘ literary ’ club held a dis-
cussion the other day as to when was the best age
to marry ! All the young members, thought the
bride should be eighteen and the groom twenty-
two, while the members with long horse-teeth, of
the English sort, sacrificed the lady at thirty (!)
and the man at thirty-six. But I think neither
party hit the mark—one went over it, and the
other below it, to my mind. Boy-and-girl mar-
riages have more drawbacks than admirers
of youth imagine and possibly the most
solemn of all is that, when the juvenile husband
finds it necessary, in the ordinary course of events,
to fly for the doctor at 2 a.in., he is likely to be
received with suspicion by that potentate, who
takes the distracted youth for a bad boy trying to
“pull his leg,” as they used to say in the Dean
case. I heard the other day of a boy bridegroom
who refused to go for medical assistance, alleging
that it would not avail, as the medico would be
almost certain not to take him seriously ! So a
married he-relative, who looked the part, was
sent flying in his carpet-slippers instead.
Apropos doctors—a lady who recently under-
went an operation in a Sydney private hospital
tells the story of her visions after an opium-injec-
tion, and thereby clearly reveals why women-
doctors haven’t Buckley’s chance with their own
sex outside of a Zenana. “ When I came to,” she
says, “ the doctor was stooping over me with an
anxious expression. ‘No more opium for you,
little woman, ’he said. ” There you have a great
trunk of medicine-man philosophy. Doctresses
will never have their own way with their own sex;
they cannot say “ Now, little woman ” the least
bit effectively.
Australian relic-hunters, whose mania it is to
secure a button off Captain Cook’s waistcoat or a
footmark of La Perouse, will be sorry to hear that
so sterling a curio as the first watch made out of
Australian gold (to the order of the gold-discoverer,
Hargreaves) is not in the Museum, where it ought
to be, but is casually worn by an irreverent youth
in the bush, who would just as soon have a Water-
bury to apprise him that dinner was ready. Aus-
tralians are curiously uninterested in the early
relics of their native land—perhaps because so
many of ’em (I mean the relics) look lonely with-
out a gaol in the middle-distance. Which, some-
how, reminds me that a new collecting mania has
arisen in Sydney—for the tops of matchboxes.
Preparations are afloat in Sydney for the hold-
ing of a charity ball in aid of the Jewish Education
Board, which is suffering from overdraft and wants
■£loo to enable it to go to sleep o’ nights. The
ball, which is in the hands of a competent Jewish
committee, certainly ought to be a great success.
But what is one ball to an Israelite ?
The annual ball in aid of the working and fac-
tory gfirls club will come off, under vice-regal,
naval, and civil patronage and presence, at Pad-
dington Town Hall on Monday, 4th May, at 9
o’clock. The factory girls’ club ball is always an
intensely toney fixture, and tickets for it are stuck
in the mirrors of the truly fashionable every year.
Mrs. (Lieut.) Harvey and Mrs. Villeneuve Smith
are hon. secs, to what promises to be the usual
brilliant turn-out.
Apropos of balls, it is evidently “the high
society plan ” (as they say in “ Club Life ”) that
when hubby is seriously ill madame should show
her wifely anxiety for his welfare by doing more
dancmg than she ever did before at all the big
public balls. But let us be charitable. This is an
age of Indian religions in fashionable circles.
Perhaps such ladies belong to the order of the
dancing Dervishes who turn themselves into tee-
totums to mollify the Fates ?
My Melbourne correspondent writes :
‘ Melb folk are sniggering over the sad fate of
h^ gh u ty youths from ’ ome who came from
Adelaide by express. At Bacchus Marsh they
descended gorgeously attired in elaborate silk
pyjamas, to get an early morning cup of tea,
I hey strolled about the station airily, and were so
much engrossed in noting the impression that
their appearance made that they heeded not the
Wn ing A i[’? d S °o got bad, >' left the plat
lZhl' A S th f t i ain departed the passengers had a
sight of two forlorn, eye-glassed figures with their
silk garments flapping round them in the piercing
wind, hurling the latest things in high-class impre
cation at all beastly engine-dwiving boundahs.’
k 6 St ? ry oes that on a recent Sunday two
members of a vice-regal circle cycled down to a
ior reirestiment. The officer,’ who is alwavs
lying in wait to catch hungry, thirsty and unwary
excursionists on the hon nmmnfli, ,V ”
them and demanded their names. JponteLmng
who they were the man in blue discreetly retTred
to his hiding-place, and the hon. and his wife
after satisfying the wants of the inner male and
female proceeded merrily on their way in search
of fresh ad ventures. Just as they set forth 20 or
30 common ordinary cyclers pulled up at the same
t^wereallji,.pounded by the same nollee^T
and, in due course of things, fined for a breach of
the law. There is no moral attached to this little
narrative.
“ Longstaff’s life-size portrait of Melb.’s late
Mayor Snowden is another win for the Australian
painter of ‘ The Sirens.’ By his splendid painting
of the robes—the mere sight of the rich brown fur
would be comforting on a cold day, while the sym-
bolic gold chain would make Bill Sikes’s fingers
itch—and the fine force of an atmospheric back-
ground, he has lent ‘ his Worship ’ a dignity which
the casual passer-by can’t easily detect. The
Council sets so awesome a value on its gold chain
that it was sent up by the caretaker with special
instructions not to let it out of his possession.
Longstaff dressed up the caretaker in the gold
chain, and saved himself from a fit of melancholy
by thus painting the subject by proxy, for poor
Snowden took his presentation portrait so seri-
ously that he grew woe-begone in his efforts to
look the right thing.
“ Of the ten ardent young Melbourne Anglicans
who, 13 years or so ago, took solemn vows of
eternal celibacy, tall Ernest Selwyn Hughes, now
chief curate of St. Peter’s, is the only one up to
date who hasn’t retrograded. The devotional
Spicer, of cross-bespangled All Saints, East St.
Kilda, led this crusade against the wiles ‘of the
world, the flesh, and the devil,’ and the first to
secede was the lately-elected Bishop of Brisbane,
then popularly known as ‘Jack Stretch.’ He had
been engaged to a young lady in Geelong before
the sacerdotal fever seized him; and when he
begged the damsel to consider herself supplanted
by a more abstract kind of bride,'she imme-
diately fell ill, and the impressionable Stretch,
finding that he would have to break either
a heart or a vow, chose the latter sin.
At intervals followed another and another
defaulter. Then Spicer himself fell a victim to
feminine bewitchments, and this brought about
general disorganisation. Now it is reported that
Rev. Evelyn Snodgrass, Lady Clarke’s brother, is
engaged, ■ after all along proclaiming ‘never,
never !’ in protestation. Old Canon Gregory, of
All Saints’, had a lively time with these would-be
monks while the craze lasted—their ecclesiastical
pranks nearly put him in his grave. They all but
celebrated Mass, openly prayed to the Virgin, and
were great upon vestments and processions. Now
these things remain as humorous memories chiefly
to the girls who onetime sighed over the per-
formers.
“ Edith Crane, the Princess Trilby, owes much
of the man-worship accorded her to the fact that
she wears no stays in either the first or third acts.
The spectacle of one real, live, palpitating woman,
especially if decollete, will bring the average man
to a state of subjection in a quicker time than all
the weaknesses of Solomon encased in stiff whale-
bone.
“ Lady Brassey has grown noticeably older since
she has been in Melbourne. She shows grey by
the side of her fringe. Yet she is only 38.
“ Dr. Freda Gamble, one of the newly-appointed
women resident surgeons at Melb. Hospital, is one
of the tallest girls in Melbourne, and one of the
strongest. She hasambition enough to accomplish
anything, and the tireless industry of a traction-
engine.
“ By the way, House-Surgeon Molloy, of Melb.
Hospital, is too wary to express any opinion about
the admission of the two lady medicos who will b a
under his charge. ‘ Bless their little hearts,’ is hi
stock comment. Now, there are several ways of
blessing people’s hearts.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
A Corowa (N.S.W.) medico insists on all

The other day Melb. saw his little daughter pat-
tering barefooted down the Block with him in
pouring rain. -
The Eight Hours Day “banquet” at
Melb. Exhibition building was commendable for
its native simplicity and economical principles.
Victorian fruits, cakes, wines and lager beer were
the refreshment provided, and the guests didn’t
number more than 175, all told.
Prof. Harry Brookes Allen, who was at
the bottom of the whole stramash about women as
residents of a general hospital like the Melb.
Hospital, is the only graduate of Melb. University
who was first in the first class with honors through-
out his course.
Solicitor Sam Lyons, Premier Turner’s
partner, trips to Europe, thus doubling Turner's
work. Now, as Turner is already suffering from
over-work, Lyons’ present trip probably means
turners early retirement from office, and this
rneans either Isaacs or Peacock in the Premier s
boots.
At time of writing (Tuesday) the returns
for S.A. elections were still incomplete, but suffi-
cient have come in to show that the National As>
has come down on its ear with a thud. Forty
members have been elected out of 54, and of the
40 there are 16 Ministerialists, 11 Labor members
who are practically Ministerialists, and only 13 of
the lory and Ass persuasion. Also, six other
elections are. practically settled though the final
returns are. not yet in, and they make up the totals
o 19 Ministerialists, 12 Labor members and 15
lory Oppositionists. Batchelor and Premier
Kingston were returned by huge majorities,
Kingston being 1306 ahead of the nearest
Ass candidate. Last election he was only
830 m front At East Adelaide the Ass was 700

them by larger majorities than at last election.

Minister of Railways via Parliament. But it will
scarcely come off.
According to Siam Free Press, Vic.

Eight-Hours day isn’t a bank holiday in
Victoria. It doesn’t matter much, perhaps, but
the proclamation might induce an odd bank to
close, which would practically mean a holiday for
hundreds of shop-assistants.
German steam tonnage from Hamburg to
Australia has risen from 24,162 tons (7 vessels) in
1886 to 111,691 (26 vessels) in ’95. Likewise sailing
tonnage, irrespective of coke-ships for Port Pirie,
has gained 9812 tons in the ten years.
Some of the Boodlewraithian election
dodges were most pitiable. In one case a quarter
of a democratic Northern constituency containing
several hundred votes was not allowed a polling-
booth, and electors had to tramp in, two and three
miles, to the centre of the city. On the other
hand, a “ safe ” country constituency was allowed
a polling-booth in a bush township, where a sum
total of one vote was recorded. In the North,
men rode 40, 50 and 79 miles to record their votes,
and in one Central constituency 40 men rode
90 miles to vote for the Labor candidate.

One of the chief features of the S.A. elec-
tions, last Saturday, was that the working-woman
voter almost always asked the poll-clerk : Are
you quite sure that nobody will be able to find out
how I vote ”? The fear of “the missus J led to
caution. Also, Premier Kingston says that the
provision for postal-voting by female voters who
reside more than three miles from a polling-place
is liable to be grossly abused, because servants
may be coerced by their mistresses.
~ John Lowles, British M.P., now on an

The recent J.P. nominations of the Reid
Govt, contain a far larger percentage of country
journalistic appointees to the magistracy than any
similar list ever promulgated in Australia. Thus
does the God-fearing Ministry make friends with
the printers’ devil!
The new President of the Orange Free
State exhorts every Afrikander to stick tight to
his Bible and his Gun.” This confiscation of
British sentiment by the arrogant Boers is an
insult to the whole Anglo-Saxon race. It must
have been inspired by the Kaiser, whose grand-
father was a whale for piety-cum-slaughter.
In Maoriland from 1886 to 1890, when the
Conservatives were in power, the province lost
14,000 people by emigration; from 1891 to 1895, under
a Democratic Government, it gained over 15,000
by immigration. Yet the Conservatives of that
past Ministry—those that remain of them—are

The country has a short memory, but it is hardly
so short as all that.
The whirligig of politics. The M‘Millan
trumpets himself as a Republican ! Or else what
means this (S.M. Herald) :
Mr. M‘Millan : . . . The time is coming when Aus-
tralia will march from the mere seat of a colonial life to
the seat of a nation. We cannot be a nation now-a-days
without taking upon ourselves the responsibilities of a
nation. And, in this great Southern Sea, if Australia is
to be a nation, it must be one among the many nations of
the world.
Another N.S.W. solicitor was committed
for trial last week on a charge of unlawfully
prigging the trust money. The law is getting into
a beastly habit of sending the alleged fraudulent
solicitor for trial just like any other man. It has
been a long time getting into the habit, but it
really seems to be arriving there pretty satisfac-
torily at last, and as a result there has been quite
a rush of Gentlemen One to gaol within the last
month or so.
Charles Beer, Kingston’s opponent at West
Adelaide, the wild-haired person who wanted to
float a loan of £1,000,000,000, didn’t go to the
poll in any serious fashion. A few days
before the election the poor fellow seems to
have gone off the small remains of his head, and
he was arrested as a pauper lunatic and sent to an
asylum, where he is now floating his enormous
loan in peace and quietude. He got 32 votes all
the same.
The Germans are going in for a serious
attempt to land Westphalian coal in England at
prices that will compete with the British article,
and with reduced freights and practically nominal
rail charges they reckon it can be done. The
German’s desire to cut out the Englander in com-
merce and manufactures has become a passion,
and some day or other it will probably be decided
that the world isn’t large enough to hold these two
States. Then something will break.
Nearly everything that hard, unmitigated
lying and slander can do to overset the M.L.
democratic Ministry is being done by the National
Ass in the present campaign. One fine specimen
statement is as follows :—“ The Seddon Govern-
ment raise money on Treasury bills in the colony
at 4 and per cent., and when they have reached
the limit permitted by law these bills are ‘con-
verted ’ in London into permanent debt. ” To
which Premier Seddon replies that since the
democratic Ministry came into power the issue of
Treasury bills has never reached the limit fixed by
law, and none of the Treasury bills have been
converted into permanent debt. It was the old
National Ass Government which did these things,
and that animal now blandly charges its own acts
to its opponents and says reproachfully that these
doings are very wrong indeed.
The Dean of Melbourne on foreign mis
sions :
He was pleased to see that the Jelap Pass had been
forced, and the Cross carried even into Thibet.
He also impressed upon people the necessity of
pushing forward with the work in the Soudan,
and with the evangelisation of Uganda. And in
Matabeleland surely, where the red-coated mis-
sionaries are carrying the “maxims” of Chris-
tianity to the “pore heathen.” The “cross”
follows the sword, and trade follows the cross.
Every missioner is a commissioner, and of such is
the Kingdom.
The Q. elections have again em-
phasised the fact that the miners and
shearers are the backbone of democracy.
Two-thirds of the Labor representation
comes from these quarters. Governmental
strongholds are the coast towns, dependent
largely on political patronage.
Colonising Kaiser Wilhelm has an eye on
German New Guinea, as well as on the Transvaal.
Prospector Braddon, looking for gold on the Mem-
pare River, was met by the Governor of the Ger-
man colony, who “informed us that he had been
advised from Berlin that a party of prospectors
had left Cairns, and he was instructed by the
Emperor to see that they did not encroach on
German territory, and take a lot of gold away
with them.” Germany must have some sharp
spies in Australia.
W Gaunson —David’s little brother Bill—
the other night, endeavored to induce the metro-
politan committee of the A.N.A., Melb., to call
upon Purves, Q.C., to assert his loyalty to the
Throne and Person, and take an oath of allegiance
to his Gracious Queen and Imperialism generally,
or words to that effect, or be hounded out of the
A.N.A., and repudiated with a cold shudder. The
attempt failed, but the fact that it was made, and
the fact that all over the country leading lights
of the Natives’ Ass have struggled to the
surface to repudiate Purves’s prediction of an
Australian republic 2000 years hence, shows that
the A.N.A. has become a mere machine for tuft-
hunters and a thing to provoke the contempt of
the native with a spine of his own.
Foxton, who takes Barlow’s place as Q.
Minister for Lands, is an obscure country lawyer,
with a political reputation for cunning, and a
fine record of solid votes for Boodlewraitii. Also,
he is supposed to have driven bullock - drays
through most of the weak places in the couple of
score Land Acts which the province enjoys, and
to be gifted with some kind of craving to codify
that vast mass of legislation. For the rest, he is
simply a reliable mediocrity.
Egypt is starting a State Loan Depart-
ment, after the Maoriland model, to supply loans
to agriculturists at 6 per cent., the private money-
lender’s rate having hitherto been from 36 to 70
per cent. The Indian Govt, is alleged to be
incubating a similar idea. Evidently it is getting
nearly too late to rave against the cheap money
scheme as a rash and socialistic experiment only
advocated by revolutionists and irresponsible
people who sleep in Sydney Domain.
•The glory of Melb. Trades Hall is indeed
departed. Up to last year the programme of the
Eight-Hours procession was always printed in full,
and the coming event got at least a column of
notice. This time a four-inch paragraph in the
Age, mentioning that the annual show would
follow a certain route, was all the preliminary puff
it received from the dailies. The Argus scorned
to remember that a labor festival was at hand,
merely remarking the fact of a public holiday
having been gazetted.
Sargood, as representative man of the
tyrannous Vic. Leg. Council, retires in Aug., and
may be defeated by a vigorous democratic canvass.
Barbour, who ran Murray Smith close at the As-
sembly elections for Hawthorn, is already an-
nounced as a probable candidate for S. Yarra,
Sargood’s province. It was in this province that
Godfrey defeated Boomster Davies last year on
the democratic ticket. Whatever happens, Sargood
will have a big fight this year. He is a clever
man, and a strong man, but his strength and
cleverness are pitted against the democracy.
A number of Yic. military officers, thirst-
ing for glory, are agitating Govt, to pay for the
transport of a local regiment to South Africa,
where, it is understood, the Empire is being
nigger-assailed. The heroes would go “on their
own, ” but they wish the matter to be an affair of
State. It is declared that the despatch of a Vio-
torian force would “ convince the world of the
unity of the Empire,” and have a soothing effect
generally on the European situation. The envy
inspired in Victoria by Sydney’s Soudan goat and
jackass is responsible for all.
In last issue appeared announcements from
two private speculators who propose applying to
Parliament for authority to build the long-expected
North Shore (Sydney) bridge. Also, there are
rumors that a tunnel syndicate is again in the
field. This violent rush of syndicates is evidence
that there is likely to be much good money in the
enterprise, and the fact that they desire the conces-
sion so badly is a solid reason why they shouldn’t get
it, and why the State should take up the matter
itself without further delay. The new syndicate,
like all previous ones, wants to annex the one good
crossing-place (from Dawes to Miller’s Point),
which means that sooner or later the State will
have to buy out its monopoly at an exorbitant
price to make its own railway connection, there-
fore the State might as well do the work at the
beginning. The amount required, estimated at
<£500,000, could be borrowed in Sydney at a low
rate on very short notice, and as the present syndi-
cate would borrow its money in London the
country would do better to owe it locally than any
other way. No great work is ever done in Aus-
tralia without owing the money somewhere, so the
lo m element may be taken for granted.

Sir Claude Champion de Crespigny has

The correct pronunciation of the names of
some of the Australian Governors is a matter de-
serving more consideration than it receives.

Buxton (but this everybody knows) is Fool-Buxton,

Percy Spence and wife return to Australia
per incoming mail. Spence’s London friends much
regret his decision to return to Australia, for he
had already made a name for himself at the “ big

his wife found the English winter trying, and the
move to sunnier skies was imperative.
A big effort is being made to drum up a
decent testimonial in Melbourne for Lormer, J.P.,
who worked the crusade against his rocky brethren
of the Bench. It is a good cause, and the fact
that Lormer is called upon to fight a libel-action,
as the result of his public-spirited attitude, gives
him an additional claim upon the lovers of clean
justice.
Old Jack Monahan, Melbourne’s illiterate
millionaire, once heard a guest at a London d inner
say that the champagne was “ simply splendid !
nectar for the gods ! ” The observant Monahan
noted the remark as useful for a future occasion,
and, later on, being asked what he thought of the
wine, replied “ Grand, sor. Grand! Simply
splendid ! Be me sowl, it’s a necktie for the

A Broken Hill paper published a full re'
port of the banquet tendered by the citizens to
Governor Carington, in the days when fortunes
were being made out of silver-shares. The proof-
reader was so knocked-up with the hard night’s

report proofs he wrote the words “Thank God ! ”
The comp., when correcting the galley-proof, made
it read “ Lord Carington then left for Singleton,
thank God ! ” The comp, didn’t suffer this time,
but the proof-reader was “ sacked.”
There has just left
Queensland the last of
a somewhat notable
family—the Archers of
Gracemere. The Ar-
chers were of Scottish
descent, though the
family settled in Nor-
way 70 years ago.
There were nine bro-
thers (three now dead),
who all at various times
resided in what is now
Queensland (some be-
fore its separation from
N.S. Wales). Seven of
them, at one time or
another, managed
Gracemere station,
which was taken up by
Charles and William
Archer in ’53, and
stocked in ’55. Brother
Alexander perished
with his wife at the
Quetta wreck. Brother
Colin, now in Norway,
is a naval architect, and
designed the Fram, in
which Nansen started
for the North Pole.
Then came Thomas,
the late Agent-General,
and Archibald, mem-
ber for Rockhampton
in the last Q. Parlia-
ment and sometime
Colonial Treasurer. Ar-
chibald first put up for
Rockhampton in ’67,
and was defeated by T.
Fitzgerald, a well-
known Northern poli-
tician. Fitzgerald
elected to sit for Mac-
kay, which also chose
him, and Archer sue
ceeded to the Rock
hampton seat a few
weeks later. Out of the
Gracemere estate the
city of Rockhampton
was carved, but the
squatter Archers main-
tained their popularity in the new city for
many years. Archibald’s ratting on the Separa-
tion question sealed his political career in the
North. He leaves Bananaland, at the ripe age of
76, on a visit to Norway.
At poor old Parkes’s recent sale was
sold his copy of Stepniak’s “ Story of a Nihilist,”
which he had bought in London in Oct., 1888.
The old man was then hobnobbing with royalty
and the aristocracies almost hourly; but he had
been so impressed by the tragic story of Sophia
Perovskaia that he then and there pencilled on the
end pages the first draft of his “ Beauteous
Terrorist.” Apparently, even in Parkes, there
was illustrated Emerson’s saying that a man’s
youth never dies. On the very day that he pen-
cilled those lines he was the guest of B ntlsh
Premier, and dined with the Prince o •
The humorless Snowden regards himself
with amazement. It is almost incredible thing
Snowden, that within the space of Jour years
can have been three times Mayor of A ’ f
addition to becoming a knight and a “ember o
Yic. Leg. Council. It does seem incredible. Even
the knighting of Bingy Benjy, after he had been
three successive mayors, was not much m
derful than Snowden’s case.
The King Charles’s head of Gov. Brassey’s
speeches is that well-contented potentate’s decease
pa. A rough estimate shows the old gentleman in
seven out of ten of the gubernatorial efforts. •
Hampden only once or twice smote the family
sepulchre, and Gov. Buxton lets the dead lie,
afraid probably of creating a smell of beer,
Brassey, when talking to a crowd, appears to keep
one eye fixed constantly on his dad.
Purves, Q. 0., dealt mercifully with old
Jock Nimmo in his remarks (Mirams v. Argus)
upon the management of Melbourne Premier Per-
manent Building Society. The venerable blather-
skite, said Purves, was honest enough but Ins
capacity, beyond understanding a volume o
Burns, was entirely questionable. The capacity
of any man who idolises Bobbie Burns is open to
grave suspicion. However, this is blasphemy
enough for the present.
After all, it seems possible that Harmy
Booth dropped upon his son Ballington for extrava-
gance, or carelessness, in managing the funds or
the American “corps.” The hallelujah officers
over there were found to be living fatter lives
than their redeemed brethren in other parts ol the
world. Some had managed to build houses, one
kept a carriage, and nearly all of them rode their
own safety bikes. Which accounts for their
loyalty to Ballington B.
Nat. Kinsman, the Melbourne auctioneer-
parson who holds the marrying “record,” was 73
in February. He still ties knots, but owing to the
inroads of advertising blackleg rivals, who do the
deed at sweating prices, his trade has much fallen
off. He conducts a Sunday-school and two ser-
vices each Sabbath. His' marriage fee was
witnesses provided, and “my photo, in my gown
with a blessing and a circular, not, as currently
believed, 2s. 6d. and under. Men employed at a
neighboring undertaker’s used to act as witnesses,
for which they were paid by the priest of Hymen.
As many as seven coupled have been on Kinsman’s
premises at one time awaiting their turn.
Mining-speculator Ziman’s late offer of
<£IOJO towards the cost of building a battleship for
the British navy is not the first, nor by any means
the largest offer of that sort, made in these regions.
An “old hand,” who had been transported for

not, because the pardon only extended to the
Australia. His desire to see his old home again
was so great that he offered, if the Government of
the day would only permit him to make the visit
to build a frigate, completely arm her, and hand
her over free of cost. His offer was declined.
Mary Meldrum, of Wangaratta, who died
th ® ° th ® r d fy> was a fine old relic of the stirring
goldfields days. Bom at Clare, Ireland, in 1807
she landed in Victoria in ’35, and, five years later’
married a publican. She delighted in telling of
two diggers who once called for 50 bottles of
champagne, when a bullock-driver replied with
an order for 70. These were produced, but a
digger, who topped the lot with an order for 100
could not be supplied owing to shortness of stock!
In those golden times, her hotel-takings often
amounted to LI 50 per day; but she died poor,
after all.
The last M.L. mining-boom (in the seven-
ties) was the boom of the working miner. Now it
is the boom of specs, and promotions. The most
prominent figure in the present upheaval is Mr.
I> Ziman, who, though he does not look like a
giant of speculation, has formed a L 250,000 com-
pany in London, and tackled some huge ventures
on the rugged West Coast, where, with the assist-
ance of experts like Gordon and Parkes, late of
the M.L. Mines Dept., Yankee Phil. Foster and
others, he should, having been early in the field
and deliberate in his ventures, make money. Mr.
Ziman was born in ’OO in “the fair land of
Poland.” In ’BO he made for South Africa, where
he speculated in produce, ostrich feathers, gold,
and so on, until the glamour of M. L. came over him.
There he bonded for a little money down such mines
as the Globe, Progress, Wealth of Nations, Sed-
don, Cadman, Salisbury, Welcome, Golden Fleece

&c., &c. With the option in his pocket, he landed
in London, reached the purses of the Roths-
children, the late Baron Hirsch, and others who
follow these leaders, so that the Consolidated
G.M. and Exploration Co., of M.L., with a
quarter of a million for a start, soon laid hands
upon whole areas of West Coast properties. The
pick of experts were obtained, others were bought
out of the Govt, service—and now Mr. Ziman has
taken up his residence at the centre of his field of
operations.

One Alderman Leggatt, of Kiama (N.S.W.),
rose up the other day in defence of the British
flag, a,nd if he doesn’t get a K.C.M.G.-ship there
is no justice left in this world. Leggatt’s trouble
was over the big painted advt. of Hixson’s
Conqueror tobacco, which represents one vessel
being sunk by another, and going down with
her flag flying. Leggatt demanded vociferously
that this sort of thing should be squashed
with the hoof of patriotism. “It is an insult to
the people,” said the Kiama loyalist; “the idea of
a British frigate being sunk by an American. It
is an insult to Us Britishers. An American never
sunk a British frigate yet.” Evidently they don’t
study history much at Kiama, and never heard of
the days when Yankee cruisers practically block-
aded Liverpool, and raged up and down the
.English Channel, and. captured two British war-
ships in the German Ocean, and otherwise made
themselves unpleasant. It is painful to record,
too, tha/b Leggatt boiled over at Kiama to no pur-
pose. The Blow-Hole municipality wants all the
advertising money it can get, and unless Alderman
Leggatt demolishes the publication with an axe in
the night it is going to remain. The most annoy-
aii Y as that the picture represented
the American ship Alabama being sunk by the
American ship Kearsage, and the nag which poor
Leggatt was raving about wasn’t the British flag
at all (Leggatt evidently doesn’t know his beloved
ag when he sees it), and the co. never attempted
to allege anything detrimental to Leggatt’s mother
country, and the whole row started with a lamen-
table mistake.

T. B. Browne’s “ Advertiser’s ABC for

cerning newspapers and periodicals in all parts of
the world. The number now on the globe’s list
appears, at a rough estimate, to be 3,416,878 —and
exactly 3,416,878 of these, more or less, profess to
be “ the oldest established paper ” or to have “the
largest circulation in the- district,” and proceed to
smear the wary advertiser with the stickiest kind

The PROPERTIES comprise Land and Buildings in some of the best
portions of the city, a"nd “Tattersall” can recommend this distribution
to all his customers, as the whole of the properties have been approved of
by him.
The FIRST PRIZE is of the value of £28,500, and consists of
splendid rent-producing properties in the heart of the city, which are
returning now a nett yearly rental of £866, though the rentals have been
greatly reduced to meet the existing depression.
THE SEVERAL PROPERTIES have been placed in distribution
at less than cost price to the owners, and there is little doubt that the
increased demand for Sydney City properties, which is already apparent,
will enable the fortunate prize winners, at an early date, to dispose of their
prizes for an amount equal to the value placed upon the properties.
PRIZE WINNERS will receive Title Deeds free of any deduction
whatever, including cost of conveyance and stamp duty, and LAND TAX
will be paid on properties for the year 1896.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Australian Fourteen did not sign agreements
nntil after the Cuzoo left Albany. The agreements are
not the same, and it will take the manager most of his
time to keep peaoe. The soreness on previous trips has
almost invariably arisen, in the first instance, through cer-
tain players getting a bigger share of the profits than
others. They all do the same work, and if one or two of
the “ lesser paid ’’ happen to “ come off,” as they usually
do, the trouble begins.
Harry Trott takes the least exercise of the team
©n board ship, when travelling. M'Kihbin seems to he
always at it, and plays the usual round of deck-games
from morn till night, and, even when going from one part
of the boat to another, swings on ropes and crossbars like
a monkey.
Bye : “ The trouble re the selection of the Aus-
tralian Eleven was caused primarily by the Cricket Council.
The Council takes no part in financing the tour, that part of
the business being left to the manager, and yet this
utterly irresponsible body claims the right to ratify
agreements and dictate rules down to the veriest details.
The contract signed by the members of the team had to
be approved by the Counoil, and the question naturally
arose—“ What have they got to do with it \ We’re taking
ourselves to England. The next Australian Eleven
should be selected and managed by those who find the
cash. It will save a lot of trouble.” On the other hand,
it is selection and endorsement by a representative body
like the Cricket Council that make “ the Australian
Eleven." “ The Australian Eleven ” isn’t any self-satisfied
dozen of cricketers who agree to go on the rampage after
British cash.
Eady, who (excepting the Test-match) has never
played in fiMi,-class cricket, owes his inclusion in the
team to the fact that he represents a fourth province,
and is “ presentable socially.” Harry, undoubtedly a
better cricketer, was practically “decided against” from
the very date of his selection because he was not likely to
shape well in bell-topper and frock-coat society.
The present English tour is likely to be handled
by Harry Musgrove on far better business principles than
preceding ones. At least' one of the recent tours is not
settled financially yet—and not likely to be.
The match usually played at Colombo by, the
Australian cricketers is really only an elaborate picnic for
the Eleven, when members sign for any drinks they want
and eat a tremendous luncheon—the whole carouse being
paid for by the Colombo Englishman. From a cricketing
point of view, the match is valueless.

Carlton’s captain, “ Jacky/ Worrall, by his
phenomenal average of, 108 runs per innings, wins Wil-
liamson and Musgrove’s crieket-trophy. The permanent
possessor had to head pennant cricket batting averages

the trophy, .with a life free-pass*to all the firm’s theatres.

Vic. football grows deader every year: gate-
money, cronk professionals and the cycling craze. A few
years back Melb. April papers reeked with particulars of
movements of the big player, the promising junibr, and
Billy the Long-drop. That seems a nightmare of the
pait.

The Sydney Polo Club’s gymkhana at Kensing-
ton last Saturday provided the usual amount of smash.
Last year a steeplechase was run, which resulted' in the
laying out and severe injury of most of the riders.
This year there was no chase, but the management, know-
ing that the spectators wanted blood for their money, put
on a-“ Gretna Green race” —an affair supposed to repre-
sent a race between a lot of eloping couples and in which
some of the competitors put on women’s clothes of various
degrees of loudness and bad taste, and started to race
over hurdles. To make the thing more exciting, two or
three men from the barracks were introduced as police-
men to catch the eloping pairs, and either under instruc-
tions or from sheer native idiocy they rode across the
competitors who were racing at the hurdles. This
naturally led to trouble, and after some narrow escapes of
a smash “Banjo” Paterson, in dodging one of these
“ policemen,” as they were called, came full speed
into 1 Veterinary Surgeon Captain W. Scott, with the
result that both horses were thrown and Capt. Scott was
Stunned and severely-shaken ; the Banjo’s horse was badly
hurt, but the rider escaped scot-free, though another
competitor rode over him at full gallop as he struggled to
his feet after the first smash. This incident imparted a
pleasing variety to an otherwise insipid entertainment.
The race was ordered to be run over again, as the “ police-
men” were introduced without the sanction of the
committee or the knowledge of the competitors as
a whole, though some of them afterwards .confessed
they were in the know.” In fact, after the
race, no one seemed anxious to claim the credit
of this dangerous and stupid bungle. The “ non-
bloodshed ” events resulted satisfactorily, “ Tom ”
Watson winning the polo ball race, as he always does,
while Paterson secured the cigar and umbrella. Brock
■Won the Cup and tandem and costume races, and Dr. Fox
and Mr. Oulley, of Narandera, accounted for the other
two events. Then the spectators, who were mostly of the
very Mite, retired to their ancestral castles, saying that it
had been an excellent day’s sport except for the accident
to poor dear Captain Scott; hut so long as the polo com-
mittee can guarantee plenty smash and injury to horses
and men at their races they will never lack a fashionable
audience.

M.L. Amateur Athletic Association has decreed

Frank Geale, the Tas. axeman who chopped
second to Tom Reeves for the championship last Nov., is
to chop Curran, of N.5.W.., for £lOO on May 24. As
Geale was only beaten by a few splinters by champion
Reeves, the corns.talk‘ win be a wonder if he beats the
slab-sided Tasmanian. In chopping matches, big stakes
seem to be the vogue. It’s one of the very few games
in which the favorite can’t run a bye, or ease up when
no one’s looking.

If Fitzsimmons has nous he’ll lie back and take
a long breath. Jonnel and Gentleman Jim didn’t fight
for years when they bossed the ring, and a credulous
’Murkan public stood by them. Corbett, by the way, is
allegedly eager to get at Fitz. When champion a few
years ago he' was equally anxious to publicly batter
Mitchell. He knew Mitchell was in gaol at the time.
Articles have been signed in Wellington (M.L.)

The Megson-Lewis benefit cycle-meeting at
Sydney last Saturday was a great success ; honors were
divided between Megson, Payne, and the ever-constant
Martin. The League’s arrangements were not up to the
usual mark—in fact, the show progressed at times with
the speed and motion of an overladen hearse.
In the final of the lap dash (a most interesting
Innovation, by the way), Martin went to the front at
gisboi-oraok, and came home a length from Parsons. The
Tank, again showed himself the best Judge and strongest
tmd gamest rider. Compared with other riders, it might
he sard that Martin has brains in his feet.
The race for boys under 12 was a dull and flat
proceeding relieved by protests. One under-12 boy was
protested against because he was a father, a second for
not having shaved for two days, a third for being above
the age of consent.
The motocycle, judged by its exhibition, is a
fearful vibratory engine, riding which should be tanta-
mount to riding a lame camel whose hump is a galvanic
battery.
Somebody put two charges in the (Chinese)
starter’s gun, with the result that the starter-nearly died
through shock to the system. Recovering, he told a
story meant to be apropos :—“Lunce, lahlah timit lung
fellah he like it to be a sholjah ; so he go join em army.
He out on dlill wit his legiment. Each time charge lung
fellah put in, each time offisah call it fi-ah ! Each time
offisah find lung fellah cove his report not go off ! Offisah

Martin, scientifically paced by M‘Lean (the 10-
miles championship), added a few more (lols. to his ever-
growing pile, by winning the Melb. 8-Hours’ wheel
race. That pub. in America must be nearly within the
Plugger’s reach now. Judging by his recent perform-
ances, Martin should be quite able to preserve order in
his bar, unless Johnell Sullivan happens to drop in for a
social evening.

Adelphi melodramas. Miss Bella was born to the stage,

of the Melb. boards 10 or 15 years ago.

Vic. Wheelmen’s League intends “enforcing
decency on the track,” and, to begin, interdicted the use
of woven knickerbockers, which are alleged to show up
the shape too much. A deadly stab at feminine interest.
A prominent cyclist is credited with being in
league! with the bookmakers, a rumor given color to
by the factUhat when he scooped the pool at a recent
meeting the penc.illers would not iaj' a penny against
him. As a manly sport cycle-racing is rapidly becoming
flyblown—like other sports where the man with the bag
gets a footing.

“ He won’t win another race this season ; and
yet he’ll piek up rnoro\ in@ney than any of us ;” said one
racing cyclist of another two months ago. Since then
that other has paced several men to victory, finishing
ignominiously himself. One case was particularly glar-
ing ; even the easily-hoodwinked public commenting.

From a spectacular standpoint the recent Christ-
church (M.L.) ladies’ cycling carnival wasn’t a success.
The bloomered talent were “ trained too fine,” and the
back view, when racing, was remembersome. A solitary
fair, fat, and fancied damsel was the only exception. She
was apparently fed up for the occasion, but her wind
gave out. The spectators were very candid, too : “ Take
yer machine home, Sis, and pad out next time.” “ Look
at her, the wish-bone of a turkey dolled up in pants.”
When people get the particulars of a woman’s anatomy,
it’s too late t@ start “ putting on flesh.”

The Rev. Rentoul, ye ken, Presbyterian meenis-
ter of Melbourne : “I dislike to see a young man astride

cyclist is the image of his Maker.

Memmott—who, by the way, seems to .ha we
asserted a supremacy over Stevenson, the South African
champion—talks of returning from London to Australia
this winter. Melbourne is dead, as regards professional
billiard-playing, so, if Memmott is to work up a boom, it
will have to be in Sydney, where Gray (another Victorian),
James, and veteran Harry Evans are available for exhibi-
tion matches. Two years in London, among the masters
of the game, must have improved Memmott considerably,
and he ought to be able to teach a lot more than he knew
himself when he won the Australian championship.

Upon the discovery of the spot-stroke in billiards
all-round play became a thing of the past, and to make
the game of interest it was found necessary to “ bar ” the
monotonous spot. As with billiardists so with glove-
fighters. The discovery that a man has a chin has re-
volutionised the game, and in place of the old-time hun-
dred Founds of blood apd thunder the average glove-fight
now consists of a round and a half, until one of the
fighters finds his opponent’s chin. To remedy the evil
and return to the good old Mays of gore—and gate—there
is.but one course open—to follow in the wake of billiards,
and bar the “ chin stroke.”

V.R.C. committee had a backed-up =£2o appeal
the other day from a decision given by its stewards. The

vary appeals from other clubs, including Caulfield ; in

recent meetings—especially Onkaparinga—that only three
or four have so far met their engagements. Better to be
an organ-grinder than an Adelaide “ book ” these.-days.

A Rand wick lady visitor, an attractive moving
picture, with cobwebby tresses of shimmering gold,
approached a noted jock, the other day and told him
she’d drawn his mount in a sweep. Mr. Colors thought
it was Tatt.’s sweep, but it turned out to be a half-crown
swindle. Nathless, she hoped “ he’d lay back-until the
finish and then come up and win.” It sounded like telling
a barber to go and get pis ’air cut.

“Charlie” Morris’s hunting champion, Fair-

has cleared £l5O in show prizes.

Tatt.’s sweep on Canterbury handicap had the
customary interesting effect; 18 started out of 36. Had
the expected “ bit to nix ” been forthcoming the whole
crowd would have probably been saddled. One thing
about a sweep-race is that neddies seem to try much
harder than usual—if there’s nothing more tempting in
the immediate future.

Mr. Herbert Creek, who spent some time in
Australia, and who recently married one of the wealtny
Misses Dugdale, met with a fatal accident whilst h anting
with the Cotswolds a few days ago, writes The Bulletin s
London correspondent. He has been in *!»

himself of the large pads, and the horse rolled on him.

Two men engaged in the business of “inform-
ing ” on Melb. tote-keepers have been committed tor per-
iurv. They carried on the industry under aliases, as the
“informer"” is, somehow, not looked upon with special
favor, and in giving their evidence they swore to their
names in the usual way. Ikey Mo. discovered the state ot
affairs, after a very long investigation, and informed on
them, with the above disastrous results.
A Sydney trotter ‘ ‘ ringing-in ” gang has been
active in M.L. lately, but its game is being checked,
and suspects are passed out weekly. Officials regularly
watch the arrival of vessels North and South, taking a
descriptive note of every suspicious-looking crowd and
their prads.

A Tote-bill is on the tapis for next Yic. session.
If so, the ho'y and unholy combination will have to once
again “ organise.” Mention the subject to. a frightened
bookie now, and he assumes the gloomy air of the last
man at a funeral.
* * * *
It is likely that should the tote continue to
reign in M.L. an attempt will be made to deal with the
double-string business. An owner running two in a race
is invariably accused of winning with the outsider in pre-
ference to the favorite for the sake of the div., whether
such was his intention or not. Under the French method
the pair would be bracketed, and losers paid if the stable-
mate won.

It is said that the ill-starred owner of the yacht

Parsons and Harris are rather neatly-footed, but
have each a fair share of hand. Porta does not take
“ladies’ two” in footwear, but Martin’s extremities are most
generous, and the late Chang would probably/have found
little difficulty in wearing either his boots or gloves—pre-
suming, of course, that “ Plugger Bill ” ever descended to
the extravagant frivolity of gloves.

At Bathurst (N.S.W.) show, a local horse
(for the special edification of Gov. Hampden) bucked
himself clean out of the saddle, the rider—W. Wright, of
Yetholme—holding his seat all the time. Which perform-
ance will probably be reported in Hingland as tending to
tighten “ the silken bonds.”


THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H- Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newnran is also a
quyer of all other Australian gems.*

Capt. Rossi, noted in N.S.W. public
memory as the layman champion in the long and
heated Goulburn Anglican Cathedral dispute, now
claims to be Comte do Rossi, and is acting aceord-
mgly. The “ berlud ” “ runs back to the 9th cen-
tury,” says le Comte, modestly, “ and then Louis
XYI. of France confirmed the title later.” The
title has fallen on lo Comte “ by a detour,” to use
his own phrase. “It isn’t like a title by purchase,
you know,” adds le Comte ; “ and, when you get
it by right, it’s something, isn’t it ? ” Then Count
Rossi relates how the French Government (Re-
publican !) had instructed its Consul-General in
Australia to discover the noble Capting’s where-
abouts, and declare to him his sang pur.
Re Prenjier Reid’s recent shark-catching
exploit, it is related that the Premier arranged
with Proctor, the professional shark-slayer, to go
down Sydney harbor and kill the next shark which
should take one of Proctor’s buoyed baits. Early
on Friday week Proctor saw the buoy dipping, and
found a 12ft. 4in. monster hooked. So as to make
it a short and easy job for the Premier, the shark-
expert reduced the length of chain, which meant
less play for the fish and an earlier death. Mr.
Reid was telephoned for same day, but, as he
ouuld not find leisure till mid-day on Saturday,
the soldiers in camp were convulsed at the sight of
Georgey Porgey going out to kill a dead shark.
From the boatshed, where the men were messing,
the vengeful G. H. could be seen, harpoon in hand,
“dealing it out” to a lifeless fish. When the
Premier returned with his victim, the soldiers
were about to greet him with three ringing cheers,
but were cautioned by the eye of “ discipline.”


Health and Strength
RESTORED

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. M. A. Cumming, of Yarraville,
Victoria, Australia, Says:
“About a year ago, I had a severe
attack of Influenza, which left me
very weak, without energy, appe-
tite, or interest in life. Obtaining
little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recom-
mended to me, I finally tried Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, and from that time,
began to gain health and strength,
I continued the treatment until
fully recovered, and now have very
great pleasure in telling my friends
of the merits of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla,
and the happy results of its use. I
consider it the best blood-purifier
known.”

The idea of utilising native cats to destroy
rabbits was tried lately near Broken Hill, with
the result that bunny and the feline fraternised
most amiably. A farmer in that locality points to
a big burrow which for long protected a choice
assortment : a ’guana, a native cat, a little
mongrel fox-terrier slut with four pups, and a
family of rabbits.
The other day, a deputation of three
Cabinet Ministers, three M’s.L.A., and three
municipal councillors brought down all the way
from Ballarat, applied to Vic. P.M.G. Duffy to
make the Ballarat postmaster live on the post-
office premises, so that he could be roused out at
dead of night by anyone who wanted a penny
stamp. Great inconvenience, it seems, is caused
by the present arrangement to people who want a
stamp at night or in the small hours of the morn-
ing. Australia has got the deputation craze badly.
Australian saltbush is being profusely sown
in the alkali districts of the S.W. States ofU.S. A.,
where formerly vegetation was totally unknown.
It grows and spreads splendidly. It has also
been thoroughly acclimatised in French North
Africa, and by the English from Cape Town to
the tropic of Capricorn. Australian pastoralists
in poor country might well follow up the hint,
and systematically sow saltbush where grass is
weak. The African and American sowings are
the direct results of Baron von Mueller’s advice, to
which also is due the gift of the eucalyptus to
swampy Southern Europe, and of the tan-wattles
and gums to Yankeeland.
The Argus, dilating on the iniquities of
Melbourne J.P.-ism, always points its moral and
adorns its tale with the “ Collingwood Trades
Hall affair,” as it prefers to call the Shelmerdene
case, in which a number of Radical Js.P. —avowed
partisans—turned up to have a say on a Bench
packed with avowed capitalistic sympathisers.
There are lots of more awful examples, but the
Argus flourishes that instance of unionistic
abomination for all it’s worth. The Trades Hall
can count on that infamy being still actively on
the job, illustrating the low, immoral, and corrupt
nature of radicals generally, when Baxter and
Rapiport are faded and forgotten, and when the
Bird who fouled the magisterial nest has fallen
out of vogue as a journalistic bogey.
Dear Bulletin, — Re contribution by
“How’s That.” The omission of one letter from
a name may entirely alter its signification. The
Holey Box—a camp about midway between Hay
and Wilcannia —received its appellation, in the
days when the world was wide, from the excep-
tional size and depth of the crab-holes in the box.
“ Box,”of course, signified a clump of swamp box,
—Riverine taciturnity admitting of no superfluous
words. The last of the box-trees at this camp —
there were only a few to begin with—was used up
by carriers and drovers about 18 years ago ; hence,
the title has become a mere meaningless, anti-
quated figure of speech, like “ Gracious Majesty ”
or “ Most Reverend.” Still, it is historic, whereas
“ Holy Box,” as spelled by “ How’s That,” seems
to smack of Orange ignorance and wanton ir-
reverence.—Tom Collins.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, arid have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Speoial
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

The Meudon tanneries, in which skins of
guillotined aristocrats, male and female, were
tanned into leather “ resembling chamois,” subse-
quently converted into breeches and gloves for
good patriots and patriotesses, were among the
most gruesome phenomena of the French Revolu-
tion. Well, something of the sort, in a small
way, still exists to prove that human hide-tanning
is not a lost art. The writer was recently shown
a piece of skin, soft and flexible, which had been
tanned for a medical student by a Richmond
(Vic.) tanner. The tanner, asked if he did much
work of this ghastly kind, replied that he did not,
but that there was a man he knew who did plenty
of it. Then he related the history of the piece of
corpse-skin held in his hand. “ When it was sent
to me to tan,” he said, “ I couldn’t make out what
sort of skin it was. First I thought it was pig-
skin, but when I compared it with some pig-skin
I had I saw that this (tapping the leather) was
much finer in grain. Then I thought that it
might be elephant-skin ” —here he explained
that the skin of the inside of the fore-thighs
of an elephant is extremely thin and fine.
“ But I found out it wasn’t that,” he went on,”
“ and didn’t try to guess any more, but tanned it.
The medicai student who sent it to me called the
next day, and told me it had been taken from the
left breast and part of the side of a woman, who
had died in the hospital. He said he was going
to have it made up into a pocket-book and
tobacco-pouch.” The writer subsequent’y met
the man who made a specialty of this shudder-
some business. He was affable and communica-
tive, and said that he had had in his possession
some time back tanned pieces of the skins of two
women—one old, the other young. He had
divided the latter amongst his friends, and had
none left, but he still had nearly the whole piece
of the old woman’s epidermis. “ Nobody wanted
it,” he said ; “ they all went for the skin of the
young party.” Sentiment, it seems, can survive
death, and even tanning. These facts are curious,
if not cheerful, and show that no man ever dies
really destitute. His skin is always an asset of
some value, which, if he likes to do a graceful
thing, he can bequeath to his friends.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their

Attention, Please!
ASTONISHING, isn’t it, that eighty out of every hundred manufacturers of Hair Restorers are
positively bald ! Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that we are fast becoming a bald-
headed people ! “ Physician, heal thyself !” could be most appropriately applied to these impostors
and charlatans. I can destroy all parasital growth as it affects the hair directly, but THESE parasites
I cannot remove. Their life or death is in your hands. Hitherto they have reaped a rich harvest at
your expense. The result is the premature loss of your hair. You can stop their little game by
refusing to buy their nostrums. If you suffered from any ailment of body you would not consult a
bricklayer or a carpenter. You would go direct to a doctor who had made it a life’s study. Why
should you continue to use preparations that are manufactured by people who do not possess even an
elementary knowledge of the “ Hair and its treatment ? ”
Send two stamps for my Illustrated Pamphlet on the “Hair and its Treatment.” To all who
desire a good head of hair, it is worth its weight in gold. Every person who wishes to escape pre-
mature baldness cannot do better than use my
Marvellous Hair Restorer.
Thousands of Testimonials to hand prove that it contains all the essential elements necessary to
produce and to keep healthy a good head of hair.

The Recording Angel’s Tear.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The man s face was neither heated nor angry.
He had cold, scrutinising eyes and a straight,
hard mouth. There was a line showing irritation
between his eyebrows.
“I had rather hear no more,” he said quietly as
the girl paused for a moment. “ The past is done
with. It was not so pleasant that I should wish
to hear it recalled. May we consider this inter-
view at an end?” His hand went towards the
befl. I he girl was almost baffled, but she made
one last effort. She had pleaded with tear-dimmed
eyes, and she trembled in every limb.
Oh, can nothing move you ? ” she cried tremu-
lously. She was such a child when she married
you, and you were always so cold. She couldn’t
live without love, and so she fell, but she always
loved you. She has repented for years. She is
dying, and night and day she moans for you, to
see you and ask your forgiveness. Oh, if you ever
cared for her, if you have not a heart of stone
send some message if you will not see her. She is
dying.”
. The man turned on her sharply. “Dying
is she. and you want a message ? Tell your
he said slowly, “that I would to God
she had died before I saw her, before she was able
to ruin my home and drag my name in the dirt.
Damn her!” he said with sudden violence, “let
her die ! ”
Outside, the night stillness was broken by the
hoarse, jarring shriek of the flying-foxes, the
snapping of twigs and tearing of leaves as they
threw themselves among the branches of the fig-
trees, and the gurgle—like dropping water—of
innumerable frogs. Inside, there was a buzz of
mosquitoes and the rattling, labored breath of a
dying woman. Her body was already dead ; only
the head turned restlessly from side to side, and
the eyes in their agony told of the mind that would
not die. The question in those eyes, as the door
creaked and opened, was so imperative that the
incomer could not choose but answer. Her hesi-
tation ceased as she saw the restless longing.
“ He was away from home,” she said, trying to
put truth into her voice. She drew aside the
mosquito-net and fanned the hot, clammy face ;
but the question still remained in the dying eyes.
“Yes, dear,” she went on, soothingly, “of course,
I wrote as you asked me to. He will get the letter
to-morrow, and then he will come.” But her heart
said, “ Before then, please God, she will be dead.”
The eyes closed, and the breath came pantingly
through the discolored lips. The hands, lying
powerless on the sheet, were blue and swollen.
The hours passed wearily by. The doctor came in
silently, saw the mark of Death’s finger-touch, and
left her undisturbed. The flying-foxes were silent
at last. A large moth flew in and flapped its
wings along the papered ceiling, and at last the
eyes opened.
“Is he coming? I can’t wait. Won’t he come?”
The girl bent over her.
“He is coming-,” she said, in an agony of sym-
pathy. “ He will soon be here.”
“ Will he—ever—forgive? ”
“Yes, that was his message; he forgives and
loves you still.”
“Loves?”
“Yes, he has always loved you.”
The end was very near, and the eyes were
glazing over. The watcher braced herself for the
last lie. Very tenderly she raised the helpless
figure.
“He is coming, dear,” she whispered; “he is
coming—I can hear his step upon the stair,” and
there was a smile of great joy on the dead face as
she gently lowered it on to the pillow.
Q-
M.A.B.
Dear Bulletin, —lie seamen and “stiff-
’ uns >” Artemus Ward’s body was “manifested”
f ()r the States as 44 one statue in case,” but during
the voyage the truth somehow got abroad amongst
the crew, who made the rest of the trip accord-
*n 3 blue funk. Isn’t this corpse-terror a
. inconsistent in men who go every day to sea
in 4 coffins ” upon the wholesale scale? —l£edge.
The Vic - Board of Health was cheered up
the other day by a worm two feet long, which the
chairman placed on the table, explaining that it
h . ad been found in the Melb. water-supply. Con-
sidering how many people bolt to a tap in the dark
and drink off a & la ss of water without bringing it
t 0 the % ht for inspection, there is something
oppressive about that two-thirds-of-a-yard of
worm
Hawkesbury Agricultural College has
to pped the Sydney market for N.S.W. cheese
wlt h 9d. per lb. wholesale. The college cheese is
<d a B P ec i*J and excellent flavor and much less
?°apy than typical Australian cheese. Likewise
it is decorated outside with what at first glance
seems like a linoleum cover. The one vital ques-
tion is whether that cheese, sold at 9d., cost a
?i li 1 1 1 ling ° r ha lf-a-crown to produce. Hawkesbury
;l° ege a Government institution. Whatever
cost ’ btate Socialism certainly produces good
cheese -
Melb. Age on the recent military man-
oeuvres:—
It is worthy of note that the horse artillery got their
guns to the top of the hill without the carriages falling to
pieces. These guns are in a pitiable condition through
?I d age ! and itj if t really not safe to move them. The guns
themselves are obsolete, while the carriages and limbers
are not merely out of date, but are literally tumbling into
fragments through decay. Five of the axle-boxes were
thrown off when the guns were fired, their iron brackets
being broken, while the screws simply drew out of the
ho,es - On the way back to camp to-day another axle-box
was . found lying-in the road having fallen off the gun-
carriage and never been missed. There is only one of the
three guns now intact, and the condition of all of them is
seriously defective, the woodwork being rotten from end
to end. If the Defence department can arrange to find
the money, it would be a great gain to the defence of the
00untr y to provide Maxim guns instead of these ram
shackle weapons ’ and this could be done at no great cost
The suggestion that pastoral tenants of
the Crown should be made to pay rent based, not
on the fair carrying capacity of the country, but
on the number of stock actually carried, has some
sound, hard sense about it. If carried into effect
it would, at any rate, not put a premium on over-
stocking. As matters stand, the chances are that
in rabbit-infested country quite as much damage
has in many instances been done by over-stocking
as by the vermin, and now the State is required to
suffer through a rent-reduction for the deliberate
spoliation of its own property. The arrangements
made between the benefiting occupier and the
mortgage co. in almost every case tend to over-
stocking and to the consequent permanent damage
or ruin of tracts of country which presently, be-
coming wholly unprofitable to all concerned, are
abandoned—and that is the worst possible thing
that can happen both to the property and to the
neighborhood.
The municipal pub. has been tried success-
fully at Elan, near Birmingham (Eng.). It is
closed on Sundays ; opened on other days only
from noon to 1.30 p.m., and 5.30 to 9 p.m. Three
quarts of beer, administered in instalments, are the
maximum daily allowance per customer. The nett
profits for the first half-year were £l4O (Elan is
only a village), and were devoted to the establish-
ment of a reading and recreation-room. Whole-
some liquor has been dispensed, and drunkenness
minimised.
It is sad to think that ‘ ‘ our literature
can never be graced by the idiom of the indigenous
digger, for the simple but convincing reason that
his pet phrases and most characteristic appella-
tions are altogether too gorgeous for publication.
Sad to say, it is the Australian-born miner who is
mainly responsible for the existing vocabulary,
and by him everything, from a dumpling to a plug
of dynamite, is designated by a term that is utterly
impossible in print. The alleged Australian ad-
jective lost its effect by use long ago, and is now
never used by a convincing linguist, excepting
in tow of a more lurid and spirit-stirring
blast. The miner swears more in friendship than
in anger, and the man cursed and condemned from
eyes to ankles knows that the : procession is in his
honor, and is duly grateful.
In Southern Queensland there are Ger-
mans who positively buy nothing but leather and
cloth. Their bread they make from their own
corn; their meat is raised on the farm —some-
times pork, sometimes wallaby; they raise their
own tobacco; grow their own coffee, and some-
times the sugar also with which it is sweetened.
The driver of the Echuca - Koondrook
(Vic.) coach picked up on the track the other day
a pair of handcuffs, evidently dropped by a police-
trooper. Out of curiosity he tried them on to see
if they fitted. They did, and so well that he
couldn’t undo them, even after applying axle-
grease to his wrists, and he was finally obliged
to drive, handcuffed, to the. next township, where
the lockup-keeper released him.
Dear Bulletin, —Re aboriginal cave-
paintings. About 65 miles from Northam, W. A.,
is a granite cave in which I counted 17 hand-pic-
tures perfectly delineated, and of the size of an
ordinary human hand. They appear to be in-
grained into the stone. Singularly enough, they
all represent the left hand. I have made many
enquiries of the natives as to the reason of these
paintings, but found them always either unable or
unwilling to tell.—J. Price, Kalgoorlie, W.A.
E. D. Williams, member for Castlemaine,
tried to be too pleasant on the subject of honorary
magistrates. He said that although he had been
long associated with the fraternity he could only
call to mind two cases where justices had been
swayed by wrong motives. This sounded very
gratifying until somebody suggested that Williams
didn’t associate with any beaks outside of Castle-
maine, and therefore he was casting aspersions
upon a pair of local men. At latest dates the one-
horse town was agitating for names, dates, and
other details, and Williams, M.L.A., was very
sorry he spoke.
Alexander Collie, one of the grandest
swindlers of his generation, died not long since in
America. The Collie firm failed in London about
1875 for a small trifle of £3,000,000, after dis-
counting =£1,600,000 worth of bogus bills with
various banks. Alexander, the boss man of the
firm, was let out on £ 1000 bail and his own recog-
nisances for ,£lOOO more, the law quite failing to
recognise that tying down a £1, 600,000 swindler
with £lOOO bail was much the same as fastening a
robust elephant with thread. He wisely left per
first steamer, as any reasonable man would have
done under the like circumstances, and never
came back.
Dear Bulletin, —‘ ‘ The poor farmer,
struggling under a heavy mortgage.” Yah !
Why doesn’t someone publish an enquiry into the
proportion of liens due to misfortune, and that
owing to mere recklessness or land-grabbing?
At any rate, about here, five “ cockies ” in ten
badly neglect onion-bed and manure-heap, and
their embarrassment is thus much akin to that of
the boys discovered “ wagging it.” Half the
phrase, at least, is mere “barracking ’ for beer
(or beer’s collaterals). To speak simply, they
struggle because they don’t. (P.S. —Excepting
the offer of State mills, by a blazing Freetrade
Premier, to expiring sugarcanists, and barring
also our Holy Faith, I take this to be the
“ record ” joke of this planet. Pardon this noble
pride.)—J.O., Harden.
Christmas at Home .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Grasshoppers in millions —sun beastly hot—
d the flies ! It’s just like old times.
“ Christmas Eve —and I haven’t been home for six
years. Another half-hour’ll do it now. Wonder
how the old people are getting on. Soon home—
the house in sight. Just over this bit of a rise,
and I’ll see the old place I was born in. Lord !
I’ve been in a good many places since I left it.
Shorn a few sheep in my time. Driven a few
mobs of cattle—seen a bit of hard life on the
Darling—and a bit of harder on the goldfields—
since I last climbed that old woollybutt tree
there. It hasn’t changed much.
“Ah, there it is ! Same old hut; same kitchen ;
same log fence round the garden where the
pumpkins grow. There’s old Polly grazing down
on the flat. She looks pretty poor this Christmas.
Look at her ribs ! And there’s mother with dad’s
hat on looking over the fence. She’ll not know
me, I’ll bet.”
We met. Mother and son, after six years ; and
great was the rejoicing in the little farm-house in
Native Dog Gully. I saw at a glance that things
were going hard with the old folks this year ; and
mother’s lips quivered when she told me that the
drought killed all the crops. I looked out into the
fields ; they were baked up—nothing left.
“ Now’s my time,” thought I, and out came
half my six years’ savings. Then things hummed
in Native Dog Gully. Dad went straight away
and brought back a lot of bottles in mother’s egg-
basket, and joy reigned.
Clinking of glasses ! Whisky ! Wine ! Beer !
Joy ! More joy ! Merry Christmas ! There’s the
dinner-bell! Christmas dinner ! with the dear
old folks at home.
“Dong! Dong! Dong!” rang the night-shift
off. I awoke too late. I looked out of the win-
dow, and saw the day-shift, with billies and tucker,
flocking to the shaft. I went back and sat on the
bed, rubbing my eyes. Where was Christmas
dinner ? Where were mother and dad ?
Yesterday was Christmas day.

The Sweater.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
And shall all men the Sweater meek deride,
And not a voice be raised upon his side ?
Perish the thought! Behold one hireling pen
Shall praise his virtues in the face of men.
He shall not go unsung his doom to meet,
Spurned hell ward by the “wild mob’s million
feet.”
What is a nation’s strength, a nation’s pride ?
Ye fools, it is the Sweater Glorified —
The portly-stomached magnate of Toorak !
Ye are but parasites upon his back.
Your days, your nights are his: your children,
wives,
Blood, sweat, and breath are his —your very lives.
And would ye seek to blight him with vain breath
Whose pedigree is old as Sin and Death ?
When Adam first from Paradise was driv’n
And unto him the stern command was giv’n
To till the earth—a fairer Earth than now—
With bitter sweat of his ancestral brow,
Behold, O foolish, thoughtless working men,
Was Satan not the first of Sweaters then ?
But his descendants show in other guise. . . .
Devout and fat, with upturned pious eyes,
You may in church upon each Sunday note
The Sweater, dressed in glossy broadcloth coat
List’ning to some fine sermon, frank and free,
Upon the Holiness of Poverty.
Is he a sinner ? Say so if you please !
He has the faith of the old French Marquise,
And thinks that God will ponder twice ere He
Will damn a person of his quality.
Why should God damn him ? In the great design
Is he not, too, an instrument divine,
Whereby through pain and anguish men are driv’n
To look from hopeless Earth with hope to Heav’n?
For, lo—ye wicked scoffers, cease your laughter !
His Hell on Earth preserves from Hell hereafter.
“Your wives and children starve?” Ye griping
crew,
What then ? Has he not wife and children, too,
Who must be fed upon the very best
That gold can buy—in raiment rich be dressed,
And all the pleasures that the Earth can give
Enjoy—if they will condescend to live? . . .
Ev’n then they find—with all these at command—
Life harder far than ye can understand.
O gaunt-faced woman, with weak, straining eyes,
Sewing by candlelight ! I hear your sighs.
But, hard as you may think your lot in life,
’Tis joy to that of the poor Sweater’s Wife,
Compelled —her social duties to fulfil
And hold her own place on the Social Hill—
To rush from rout to rout, from ball to ball,
And miss no function and no festival.
The Sweater, too, whom ye revile, is he
Not sweated also in his own degree ?
Observe him at a “Fair-trade ” Banquet rise
With brow perspiring and congested eyes,
Glass in his hand—in orator’s position—
Responding to the toast, “Free Competition ! ”
Ye wretched grumblers, by good luck debarred
From such dire ordeals —is his fate not hard ?
Ye, who can revel upon wholesome tea
And good dry bread, how would ye like to be
Condemned day after day (and not complain)
To eat roast turkey, and to drink champagne ?
While ye are toiling—all the long night through,
Perhaps—at work he’s given you to do,
Is he not lying on his bed of down,
Planning to dock your wages half-a-crown,
Manfully grappling with the problem tough
How to contrive to leave you just enough
To keep alive—he is no soulless Turk !
Yet get from you the last half-ounce of work ?
Workers ! This Pillar of your Church and State,
I beg ye do not scorn nor execrate !
Give him whate’er he asks —not much you’ll find—
He only wants the fruit—you get the rind.
The smallest sweater of them all has rights
To be considered —also appetites.
What though for bread your starving infant begs,
Remember he must have his ham and eggs !
These to refuse him would you be so base?
The knowledge that you would not lights his face,
And makes him murmur with a smile resigned :
“ There is, thank God, no hunger —l have dined.”
The sweater is no fiend, no monster fell,
Too foul for Earth, and ev’n too vile for Hell.
He is your good, kind friend. How when he dies
Some papers praise his virtues to the skies ;
Tell tearfully about the gloom outspread
The city o’er when men heard he was dead ;
Call him of Trade a Prince and Pioneer,
And end each sentence with a larger tear !
Go to the graveyard where his body lies.
Yon noble column pointing to the skies—
Seeming thereby to dumbly indicate
To all men his celestial after-fate—
Inscribed with golden letters, carven well,
Which all about his many virtues tell—
If ye but knew it, was upraised by you —
Built by your sweat, ye unbelieving crew !
Now read the last lines of his epitaph,
And if ye do not weep, pray do not laugh !
“ A just man gone to meet his blest reward—
Weep not for him. He sleepeth in the Lord.”
V. J. DALEY.
There seems to be a strange fatality about
the editorship of the Pall Mall Gazette. Since
its foundation in ’65 four of its five editors have
been fired-out by irate proprietors : Frederick
Greenwood, W. T. Stead, E. T. Cook, and Henry
Cust have all in turn departed precipitately. John
Morley, who was editor for about two years,
“resigned,” and so escaped the usual ejectment
process.
Lovely woman cropped up at Collingwood
(Melb.) police-court, the other day, in the unusual
character of an apologist for her husband’s obscene
language. Having casually assured their worships
that she had banged her old man’s head with a
boot until words unfit for publication came stream-
ing from his mouth, the gentle lady was called as
a witness for the defence. Whereupon she kissed
the Book, and deposed that she did well and truly
give “a blanky hammering” to the defendant.
For the “blanky ” she was charged with contempt,
and locked up for six hours, whilst the victim
of the assault got sentenced to 205., or three
days, on account of the original offence. Foul
language, it seems, is a misdemeanor under any
circumstances. Even though your heart’s best
love address you with a garden-shovel, or a pair of
tongs, you mustn’t reply with anything stronger
than poetry.
Of 693 students attending Melb. University
last year, 193, or two in seven, were women. Of
these women-students 48 studied in arts, 14 in
medicine and two in science ; while of 143 music
students no less than 129, or over 90 per cent.,
were women.
Argus, Age and lawyers all take unkindly
the suggestion to abolish the long vacation. Then
by all means abolish it.
When one of the directors in the late
lamented City of Melbourne Bank was asked in
court if certain securities had become valueless,
he got up on his dignity, and retorted hotly : “ 1
think it is very bad taste to ask me such questions.”
Whereupon the Argus in a burst of sarcasm :
What is the use of living in a colony possessed of the
antiquated and so-called radical notions of forty years ago,
if embodiments of Victorian radicalism are to be asked
questions devoid of good taste ?
“ Embodiments of Victorian radicalism ”! Thirty
odd members of Vic. Leg. Council are directors :
the average director is a fatted Tory, blatant in
his hatred of all forms of radicalism. But with
the Argus the man who is found out is always a
radical.
Gloucester (Eng.), which was largely
opposed to vaccination for many years, is suffer-
ing from a small pox epidemic, and a sudden
demand for lymph has sprung up in its midst.
This proves nothing, either for or against the
vaccination doctrine. Few people doubt that Dr.
Jenner discovered a means of checking the spread
of small-pox, and reducing its virulency. An in-
flamed arm is less undesirable than death, there-
fore a terror-stricken community chooses the less
evil in preference to facing the greater one with-
out taking precautions against it. The question
as to how much disease is conveyed from un-
healthy bodies to healthy bodies by compulsory
inoculation remains as vexed as ever. Likewise,
the question whether an unvaccinated person who
has survived an attack of small-pox isn’t better
off than his vaccinated brother who never caught
the infection. One thing only seems quite certain.
Vaccine is blood poison, harmless or otherwise, as
the case may be.
The Dental College and Hospital of Vic-
toria opened its new lecture-hall with an im-
posing social splash. Honorable Bob Best
made a speech, full of references to pathology,
histology, bacteriology, therapeutics and false
teeth, after which the hall was understood to be
properly started as a going concern. Otherwise,
the function consisted mainly of two simultaneous
concerts, upstairs and downstairs, varied by much
refreshments in a marquee. The Dental College,
although barely a year old, seems to be a well-
established success. Students of both sexes—
Speaker Berry’s daughter figures among the girl
graduates —are coming along steadily, and several
resident patients have testified to the quality of
the institution. Also, it has been taken up by
the Melbourne medical profession. About 70
surgeons and doctors dropped in during the other
evening to lend the light of their countenances to
Principal Oldfield, so it happened that when one
among the other 400 guests (an elderly lady) was
taken ill, she had to be fenced in with chairs to
preserve her from the awful rush of qualified
practitioners. Ultimately the patient escaped
with her life, by the mercy of Providence.

Ye were one of them, Joe. Yes, I could claim a
pension now. Half-pay, Joe—half-pay. There’s
nothing to keep me nere now since the wife and
the poor old mother died. I’ve been here five-and-
thirty years, Joe —bushman, digger, farmer, and
schoolmaster. I’d like to be near the sea in my
old age. The times have changed, Joe, the times
have changed. There’s nothing to keep me here.
Come up and have tea with us, Joe —for auld lang

He retired next year—without a pension.

AYER’S SARSAPARILLA
CURES
Indigestion, Sleeplessness, Loss of Strength and
Appetite, and Nervous Disorders,
%
The following letter from Mrs. S. Gash, of Kent Town, So. Australia,
whose portrait is given above, is additional testimony to the remarkable
health-giving power of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla:
“For two years or more I suffered considerably from indigestion,
sleeplessness, and loss of strength and appetite. When I did sleep I was
not refreshed, and I always had a severe headache in the morning. I was
induced to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and was more than pleased at the
result, for after taking three bottles my complaints disappeared, and I
have been in the best of health ever since. 1 can strongly recommend
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla to any one afflicted as I was.”
The wonderful success of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla in purifying the blood and
restoring health and strength to systems enfeebled by disease, or the enervat-
ing effect of a warm climate, has led to the placing on the market of other
preparations called Sarsaparilla. Remember that imitation is the sincer=
est form of flattery, and be sure that you get AYER’S SARSAPARILLA
which lias stood the test of time, has won the highest awards at the world’s
great expositions, and has been a blessing to the people of Australia, and
all civilized countries, for more than a generation. No other medicine operates
so effectually in removing general debility, languor, and all outward symp-
toms of the grave mischief caused by disordered nerves and impure blood.
