“Ait in Australia.”
During the present period of high-falutin,
Centennial “ blow,” Australia has pulled herself
together ani carefully and categorically gone over
the entirety of her attractions. She has com
pared her progress with that of the nations of the
earth, much to her own satisfaction. Her trade,
her industries, her resources (mineral and agri-
cultural), her advancement In the various branches
of science, her sport, even her literature and her
art, have each and all been measured and gauged
wioh an infinitude oJ self-gratulation. Members
of Parliament, advocates of Imperialism, Pre-
miers, ex-Mlnisters, newspaper-writers, and pre-
sidents of art societies have seized their trumpets
of tin and their cymbals of brass and assisted in
the laudation of everything Australian. In a
recent issue of the Sydney D.T. some callow
c rushes into print to deliver his
ideas on the subject of “Art in Australia,” and,
ot course, such views at such a time as the present
take a special Centennial colouring. He says of
an artist’s appeal for Governmental aid and State
patronage that it was a
Manly and outspoken opinion upon the subject of art and
for the suggestions made by him as to the advisability of the
Government providing a system of education which would
hava a tendency to develope to its fullest extent the capa-
bilities and genius which, unfortunately, are at present dor-
mant in the youth of Australia.
He deserves the warmest thanks of the com-
munity. # # *
We fail exactly to see where the manli-
n )ss comes in here. There is nothing particularly
ennobling in the appeal for a Parliamentary
“ shore ” to prop np that which ought to be self-
sip porting. The “ genius " which is of so poor a
q lallty that it 1s at present “ dormant ” for want
of national charity had better remain so, for all
t lings nurtured and patronised by statesmen are
simply instruments and panders Inasmuch as their
existence depends upon caprice on the one hand
an I flattery and subservience on the other. Under
a system of Government patronage the artist
w mid paint for the Government and not for the
pmlio. Why should the Government “ patronise’’
talent because it takes a particu’ar form I The
buiding but penniless financier, with a “ genius ”
for manipulating untold sums, has quite as much
lOilc on his side when he demands loans from the
St ite in order that his “ dormant ’’ “ capabilities
and genius" may got a field for their exercise.
We are compelled to admit —and we admit It with
p a t a —that art has too often been the humble tool
aid grovelling slave of Rink, of Wealth, of Dss-
potsm. Art has “flourished” in the darkest
perl ids of the world’s political servitude. Every
tyr iat nearly has bson noted for the extension of
his “ patronage” to art, and the regal bully gene-
rally kept his artist for the same reason that he
ks jd hfs Court fool, viz., to amuse him in the first
In nance, to glorify his rule, and to flatter his
va iity. Two of the worst men that ever rode
rough-shod over Christendom, Charles V..
K operor of Germany, and Henry VIII. of Eng
laid, were famed as “ patrons" of art, and the poor
drivelling would-be tyrant Charles I. was fond of
pictures and “patronised” artists extensively. In
own time it Is not the merit of a picture
which makes its reputation. That exalted per-
s mage Tummy lets fall a word of commendation
and the picture becomes the “rage" of the
seisin The Prince of Wales’ smile is of In-
finitely more value to an artist than any amount
of genius, “dormant” or otherwise.
* * *
Artists are ever prone to glorify the
glorified and seek to paint the lilies of rank and
wealth. Julian Rossi Ashton said in his recent
D.T. Centennial art paper •
0 damns from special correspondents would not avail to
vivo so graphic a presentation of an heroic incident in our
national life as Da Neuvilles " Defence of Rorkes Drift.
The emotions are more strongly stirred by the, work of tin
artist because the mind of the beholder is able to grasp the
whole situation at once.
Yet the hero Roy finds no place in this artistic
pa nt-offering to England’s alleged greatness. It
was loft to a newspaper to call public attention to
hi i miserable plight, when In sightless dependency
he was starved and kicked about in the noisome
cells of an Australian pauper refuge. But there
remains a chance for some Australian artist to
embody the latter Incident, and Mr. Ashton might
prove his prowess as a large-souled artist by em-
ploying his brush to depict it.
* * *
Art only in rare instances does aught for
our common humanity. In the Victorian
Assembly, not long since, it was proposed
that the sum of £lOOO should be place! on
the Estimates for the widow of the late Marous
Clarke, the author of a truly great book, which it
is not the least of Victoria's glories that he pro-
duced, but the motion was negatived without
division. The Sydney Echo attributes this to the
“ democratic dislike to the liberal arts," but this
is all nonsense. The people of America, the most
widely-advertised, if not the most genuine, Damo-
craoy of present times, give every passible en-
couragement to the liberal arts, as well as to in-
dustrial pursuits, and so will it be in every
country where the arliat has the sense to put him-
self en rapport with the public, with the endea-
vour ta please it, instead cf attempting the reali-
sation of fads and theories to please himself, In
the case of Marcus Clarke, too. there was some-
thing accomplished, something great and worthy
done; there was no effort to compliment the
great or to pander to officialdom, and th's was,
perhaps, th* reason why his widow received no
pension. He was dead, and consequently could
notask for a gratuity that he might “dovelope
capabilities and genius” of the stiongly-marked
“dormant ’ brand, Perhaps the loudest in their
clamours that his widow should not receive this
sum of £lOOO were those very artists who shoutFo
loudly for a Government subsidy. For most
“ artists " can understand the existence or possi-
bility of no art but pictorial art, and this alone,
they consider, should be encouraged.
• • #
Let the artist ia Australia—alas ! that we
cannot say the Australian artist—paint what hPs
the public taste and the public will buy it, but
this pitiful wailing after a State crutch is too
nauseous and spineless in its dolorous mendicancy.
The callow correspondent aforecited trots out the
ancient objection that the people are not educated
to recognise “true art,” &0., and then imme-
diately contradicts himself by saying that—
Hogarth was, without doubt, the first painter to touch
the right chord and arouse the popular feeling. But his
admirable productions were very expensive and only found
purchasers among wealthy connoisseurs. The public crowded
around the windows of the shops in which Hogarth s
paintings were exhibited and gazed long and fondly at them,
but were unable to purchase. . . . IS was not till the
works of George More and were produced that the masses
had the opportunity of possessing pictures of merit.
Showing that when the artist really touched the
“ tight chord," when he hit the taste of the public
he had patrons enough and to spare. The fault
lay with the artists themselves, and no amount of
State aid to “ dormant ” genius of certain pecu-
liar types of dormancy would have made the pic-
tures of some artists popular. The writer dis-
proves his own contention in these words :
I do not believe that art will be allowed to deteriorate
i a Australia ;i it only requires a little patience and perse-
verance on the part of the artists themselves to make their pic-
tures famous. The public are every day becoming more
alive to the necessity of art, and ere long it will hold a high
position in this Southern Continent, and those who help to
attain it will be amply repaid for thei? trouble.
• •
The troth ia that people have hitherto
looked in vain for the qualities of genuinely
original art in Australia. Many self-styled Aus-
tralian artists are simply copyists who depend
upon the truthfulness of their imitations of native
scenery and who seem to be utterly incapable of the
merest exercise of their imaginations. If the
sole aim of art ia to “ copy ” a bit of rock, a bit
of water, a bit of cloud, and to get as far away
from Nature without getting into anything else
while “copying,” the photograph will always
have the preference. The people always “ under-
stand” a great picture —the representation of a
great joy or a great sorrow ; a splendid achieve-
ment or something of that human nature one
touch of which makes all the world akin. Give
them something of this sort, and they will not
haggle and split straws about bid drawing or in-
different colouring, a faulty i ieca of composition,
or a wrong distribution of light and shade. The
D.T.’s correspondent says elsewhere :
After spending weeks, ofttimea months, in the pro-
duction of a picture, the artist exposes it to the
gaze of the critic. Perhaps to the critic's mind, the
colour is not distinct or pronounced enough, or
the light and shade totally opposed to that which his (the
critic’s) imagination pictures, and the production ia at once
designated—though it may be of sterling and genuine merit
—a " daub ”or a failure. Faults are found with the moat
trivial details, and the artist's labour is, for the time being,
thrown away.
If the work of art depends exclusively upon its
technical reproduction cf colour, form, chiaro-
scuro, &o , for whatever of merit id may possess it
must be judged rigorously upon these grounds.
Where the artist labours to shadow forth a piece
of his soul, some great and splendid ideal, the Im-
pertinences of mere technical criticism are not to
be endured for an instant. If the picture is
trivial it is right and proper for the critic to find
fault “ with the most trivial details.” If the pic-
ture is great it must be viewed from quite another
standpoint.
• • •
We are not here dealing with the critic
who has not “ a vestige of art in his composition, *
but to maintain that any man, because he is not
an artist, cannot be a critic, is to condemn art at
once and for ever. Its aim disappears—its use
fades away from the roathetic needs of life. In
other words, a man cannot enjoy—critically- a
play of Shakespeare's without being a dramatist.
He cannot appreciate—critically -the representa-
tion of Hamlet by Irving without being an actor.
He cannot critically lose his recollections of the
demands of the material world In the melodies of
a Mozart without being a musician. It narrows
the world down to the little admiration societies
of Little Pedlington. Surely no artist who had
an atom of self-respect would care to have his
works purchased by those who understood not
their meaning ? Yet if artists only are capable of
a proper appreciation of art—which we are told is
universal and eternal—artists must starve. And
ail this nonsense arises from a notion, a poor, nar-
row, lame idea, that a knowledge of art is a mere
knowledge of technique. If pictures were painted
with a tar-brush on a pale-fenoa it would not sig-
nify to the true critic. The effect, the totality, is
all in all, the means by which it Is arrived are
not worth discussing—save to the artist. That is
his business. He may paint pictures on packing-
felt, with a sponge dipped in whitewash, If ho
chooses. The critic adjudges the value of
the work—not the means by which the
work is produced. And the further conten-
tion that only artists should be trustees
of art galleries is another fallacy. Being artists,
they would be to some extent disqualified. The
bold splendour of a “ genius” that was not “ dor-
mant” but rudely expressionful, would probably
be cast aside for the laboured dilletanteism and
technical correctness of some careful draughtsman
or artistically toilsome colourist. The glorious
but budding greatness of a Michael Angelo, who
had not learnt to draw properly, would perhaps
be consigned to a lumber-room to give place to
the painstaking but eviscerated efforts of “ dor-
mant capability,” which, like Professor Haxley's
prodigy, “ could make an accurate elevation,
plan, and section of a pint-pot.” In other words,
the greatest attention would be given to those
studies which evinced “ a most valuable training
of hand and eye,” and little or no attention
to those which evinced great imagination,
powerful conception, and that almost indefinable
quality Hszlitt was fond of designating as
‘gusto.”
* • *
And if the State must foster art, why not
all art ? Why should not the nation be put to the
cost of a training-school for poets ? Literature
has done most to lighten the woes of humanity,
therefore the litterateur should be fed by a grate-
ful fatherland, and, with the pictorial artist, fat-
tened for public use in an aesthetic sty.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Whatever the song, it never
Basils long with the bard who sings ;
Real toil and leal trouble sever
Whatever his fancy brings.
As scenes in the distance only
The artist can wholly paint,
The poet sings joys when lonely,
And strength when his heart grows faint.
But only when strivings bitter
Have frightened these joys away,
Yet time haj not quenched their glitter
Nor hidden their bright array ;
Whiie, mocking and tantalizing,
They watch from the heights afar,
Where the heart is too faint for rising—
Attalnless as phantoms are.
The sight, and the loss, more keenly
Deride with the lost things’ worth,
And, drawn by the'r beauties queenly,
The passionate song finds birth.
Yet sooner the dream Elysian
The rapt mind has scarce enjoyed, v
Than knows it is all a vision,
And nought is but dark and void.
And when in the daylight streaming
Perchance shall such poet stand,
A hundred strange eyes are gleaming
From shade nooks on every hand.
And midst joy and midst strength he writeth
Their horrors, to feel them bo
As day-dreams that sunshine lighteth
Ere night can make real their woe.
Yet times are when the ideal
So brightly dawns on the heart,
That songs of a fervour real
Like carols of free birds start;
More bright, that the past was dismal;
Tranecendent, the while they last !
But oh I to what depths abysmal
The fall, when Ideals have passed 1
The soul that for song is fashioned
Is not for this world of ours,
Where fierceness taints all impassioned,
And serpents are in the flowers ;
Where strife and deceit are thronging.
And airs are with venom rife,
And the hours are filled with wronging.
And warfare alone is life !
While scarce the world’s wealth Is tasted
By those who bring forth its store,
And, they, with their first-fruits wasted,
Toil vainly for evermore ;
While earth from earth’s sons is riven,
Who have not a place to stand,
And even as slaves are driven,
Or starve at their lord’s command—
While all of earth’s good worth keeping
Is reft from by whom it was sown,
And garnered the bounteous reaping
By schemers who toil alone
To grasp what the rest are making ;
And on to eruption mad
Humanity’s mount seems quaking—
Tnlnk you, can tha bard be glad ?
He longs for a world where gladness
Is wide as the radiant light;
Where sloth is the only sadness,
Where bight Is the oal> might.
Great joys from this world’s beginning
Have been ; he would share their bliss,
But he shrinks from the ghastly winning
By strife, as the world now is.
And yet, if now guideless bending
His footsteps to what is best,
The vanmost shall, in the ending,
Be first with the bright goal blest.
As his trial now it is, bo it
Shall be for his comfort given ;
And the chant of the world’s last poet
Shail peal from the vaults of Heaven !
J. A. ANDREWS.
Protection and laud Nationalisation.
Land Nationalisation is a great and a noble cause
but it does nob comprehend within itself the
defence against every political danger to which
our community is exposed. Advocates of this
reform are prone to fall into the error of supposing
that it does : they are carried away by the very
vastness of the scheme, and seem to think that
when its enormous advantages are secured no-
thing more will be wanting to the perfect social
bliss of all classes of citizens. In this matter they
err in distinguished company. Henry George,
their leader in this great reform, is their leader
also in this error. In him the blunder was natural
enough. His theory is based upon the writings of
Bastiat, Quksnk, and others, whose bHe noir
was indirect taxation, for which they proposed to
substitute direct taxation of land values. He
expands and modifies the theories of these
authors, and, like them, makes the whole system
of indirect taxation bear the brunt of attacr.
His book on the question of “Protection and Free-
trade ” is almost entirely an attack upon indirect
taxation. Protective duties are to him (vide p. 86)
the only species of Custom House taxation capable
of any justification ; his fiercest censure is directed
against the revenue duties on imports—the duties
to which “Freetraders” of our day so resolutely
adhere. It is true that he regards protective
duties as being unnecessary, even under present
circumstances, the basis of this view, being the
somewhat startling argument that men who work
long hours do not do so much as men who work
short hours, and that men who receive high wages
do not produce so cheaply as men who are poorly
paid—a proposition wnioh he does not support
with any sufficient proof. But because he de-
clares for absolutely free ports, and for the aboli-
tion of all indirect taxation very many of his ad-
herents are prone to do likewise without examin-
ing the arguments upon which his sweeping
generalities are supposed to be founded.
* * *
Before pointing out why Protection must be
necessary to Australia, even after I and Nationali-
sation is accomplished, it is worth while to re-
mind enthusiastic associates of that reform that
their millennium is yet afar off. In acquiring the
unearned increment for its rightful owners, the
people, they will have to overthrow the banded
phalanx of land owners—a work requiring long
decades for its perfect accomplishment. He is a
super-sanguine man who supposes that the work
of reform will be completed during the next 30 or
even 50 years. And what is to become of the
working-classes meantime ? Are they to draw
sustenance from the anticipations of next century {
Will they be able to cash “post obits” payable
after the death of private ownership of land i
Even if the interval were only 10 years there
would still be the necessity of affording present
relief, for the workman who can live upon nothing
for a whole decade is not yet reprt sented in the
community.
* # *
Apart from the foregoing consideration, it must
be evident that whether Land Nationalisation be
adopted or not, some measure of Protection must
always be necessaxy so long as the cost of produc-
tion is greater here than in other countries. And
Henry George to the contrary, notwithstanding,
the cost of production must, generally speak-
ing, be greater so long as the wages
per hour paid are higher than in coun-
tries with which we have to compete. A
proof of this fact may be found in the cabinet-
making industry of Sydney. A few years ago
this work was all done by eight-hour Australians,
but Chinese, working for less than one-half Aus-
tralian wages, have now almost completely
ousted our countrymen from this industry.
Hundreds of other familiar facts might be cited
to prove the same truth. In the matter of loco
motives, for instance, it is shown that England
and America can supply at 40 to 50 per cent, less
than Australian prices. Protection is a necessity
to the eight-hour system. If Australians were
content to work hours a day for the present
day’s wage there would be no need of Protection ;
our limitless natural wealth of raw material
would make competition possible within an area
of production sufficiently wide to provide ample
employment for all willing workers. Such reduc-
tion of the rate of wages would, in fact, be
equivalent to an all-round protective duty of 50 per-
cent. on imports, Henry George’s argument as to
the dearer production by artisans working longer
hours is absurd, in face of the fact that a lower-
wage is paid for the long, Old World day than for
the shorter term during which labourers work in
Australia. Break down the eight-hour system,
and Protection becomes unnecessary to our com-
munity ; sustain that system, and Protection is a
national necessity.
• * #
Land Nationalisers must also remember that
their reform would not directly tend to the crea-
tion of national wealth. Even if a yearly revenue
of £50,000,000 were by this means secured to the
Treasury, not one penny piece of that amount
would represent wealth added to the State or the
community. The sum would simply be taken
from the monopolists and given to the State.
There would be nothing more than a re-distribu-
tion of income ; if the State had so much more
revenue, individuals would have so much less.
Further —and this is a most important point—it
must be remembered that the increment of land
value depends entirely upon the productiveness
of the community. Wealth must be produced, or
else land ceases to have any value at all. Take
the records of New South Wales and Victoria
during 1887 as illustrative of this basic truth. In
that year employment in the protected colony was
abundant—that is to say, the production of wealth
was great, and land increased in value from 10 to
200 per cent. ; in the “ Freetrado” colony, on the
contrary, employment was scarce, there was
but meagre wealth-production, and land in most
localities actually decreased in value. Instead of
there being any additional unearned increment in
New South Wales during 'B7, there was, generally
speaking, no increment of land values at all.
Therefore, even with Land Nationalisation
achieved, the sum of national wealth would not
increase if the productiveness of the land were
checked by the suppression or extinction of
national industries. Protection and Land
Nationalisation must, in this land of high wages
and short hours, go hand in hand ; the one is the
complement of the other. Else when the battle
of land ownership is won, it may be found that
the spoils of the fight—despite the great natural
resoux-ces of our Continent—were not worth the
trouble of winning. Natural stores of the materials
of wealth are worthless if foreign competition
takes from us the power of utilising them for our
owix enrichment.


Parkes on Private Character.
At a recent Centennial banquet, Sir Henry
Parkes waxed eloquent over the functions of the
Press. He praised one paper for its Opportunism
—of "which we are thankful to say he cannot
accuse The Bulletin— and bestowed a faint
eulogy on another organ on account of its large
circulation. Sir Henry, however, denounced
The Bulletin for “slandering private character,”
and he did so simply because he cannot stand on
his private character and challenge the criticism
beneath the fierce light of which a Gladstone
walks unsullied. But The Bulletin glories in
being denounced by a man who has to totter
through a jeering world with the private char-
acter of Parkes. The record of his life is a tabu-
lated analysis of the most terrible propensities
which modern society—in Australia— ssems will-
ing to endure in its “ statesmen.” Each letter of
his name might stand as the synonym of an
odious characteristic—selfishness, ingratitude, in-
consistency, (reachery to old and tried fi lends,
the fomentation of religious bigotry, egotism, in-
tolerance of opposition—the list is well nigh in-
exhaustible. The spectacle of such a man at the
head of a nascent nation at the ce ebration of its
hundredth birthday, is enough to make the angels
weep. After all, when we read Parkes’ Centennial
Frees speech, calmly and seriously, we think it is
better to be denounced as he denounced The Bul-
letin than praised as he praised certain of the Syd-
ney dailies. The opportunities, the golden oppor-
tunities, so eagerly seized and turned into coin ia
the shape of Government advertisements, which
Parkes so warmly recognised as forming no in-
significant part of the policy of the Australian
Press, we regard as so many gilded smudges on
its reputation. The autocrat of New South
Wales accuses us of attacking private character,
simply because he cannot see that the private
citizen is inseparable from the public man. In
proof of this, we have only to take the fact that
the same person who sold a mortgaged allotment
to a day-wage labourer endeavoured also to cele-
brate a nation’s festival by a political burglary,
and treated colonies much in the same fashion as
he had time and again treated individuals. The
private life and the public life are indivisibly in-
tertwisted. We hold that a man who is dishonest
privately is dishonest publicly. Parkes may
object that the private citizen is one individual
and that the politician is another. He cannot re-
cognise that the functions of one overlap the
functions of the other. The law, however, does
so. The insolvent—unless he be a Parkes —is
compelled to vacate his seat in Parliament. The
man who has in certain ways transgressed cannot
—unless he be Parkes —represent a constituency
in the Parliament of the country. In some parts
of the world this rule is made more stringent than
in others, Parkes derives all his power from his
ability as a trickster, none of it from his moral
worth. The other day he told Australia that
honour did not consist in paying twenty shillings
in the pound. From his moral constitution,
Parkes is absolutely unable to tell Australia in
what honour does consist.
• * *
Parkes has no friend, simply because he never
understood the meaning and sanctity of friend-
ship. His force of will is great—great enough to
overawe the abject mediocrity of a cringing Par-
liament, but he derives none of his ascendancy
from the beauty of his pi’ivate life. His egotism
is supernal, and history proves that egotism ia
one of the most valuable factors in political ad-
vancement In moments of stupendous vanity
he flatters himself by publicly-made comparisons
of himself to Gladstone, a man from whose
private life calumny shirks in terror, and against
whom malignancy of the blackest dje turns pale
at its inability to launch one telling shaft.
Parkes clings to the skirts of Gladstone, but
he is of the broed that Gladstone spurns with
disgust. We want men as pure in their private
and in their public life as George Hig in botham.
Men of flesh and blood and human sjmpathies
who would transact the affairs of nations with
the same scrupulous regard for snow-white pro-
bity as they would the affairs of private indivi-
duals—not tricksters who would “ slip up” their
creditors on Monday and coquette with States on
the day following ; who would sell their country
for a letter of the alphabet to be appended to
their names, and their election pledges for a gew-
gaw. Honesty is an individual and not a political
virtue. If a man has it not in his own proper person
in private life it surely does not suddenly descend
upon him when about to purchase for the State
and pay for from the public Treasury already
State-purchased and State-paid-for land ! And if
our affairs are to be conducted by men whom their
own alleged friends cannot trust, how can we be
trusted by the nations with whom on our account
they transact business 2
• * *
One nation should be able to deal with another
nation, as one man of honour with another man
of honour. But ho w can this be when we are
forced to speak through such sullied mouthpieces 2
Parkes, with hiSjtremendous egotism, will attempt
to justify himself alone upon his political career
Look well to it! To Foster and Greenwood he
owes his vaunted Education Bill. He is the
champion “ disher ” of his opponents. He is the
monumental plagiarist of Australian politics.
Not one single great Act owes its parentage to
Parkes’ brain. He has alternately supported
and denounced every principle. The private
insolvent Parkes is the public Parkes, the
wholesale appropriator of other men’s ideas. The
citizen cannot exist seperate from and coeval with
the politician, and Parkes is such a stupendous
egotist that, large though his frame may be, there is
no room in him for anybody but himself—himself,
the cold-blooded, ungrateful old vendor of mort
gaged allotments, and parent, by repute, ef
second-hand enactments. Sir Henry objects
that we attack private character. Need any fear
the attack but those whose characters are vulner-
able? Let us take any fictitious case. Would Hr
Henry hold for one moment that the man who
filled a high and important office in the State was
not mentally and morally incapacitated by such
dubious characteristics as denouncing the char-
acters of good-hearted, steadfast men simply
because they were opposed to him 2 Of taking
to his bosom the cast-off and degraded creatures
of former days simply to subserve his own ends 2
Of dealing in moral and high-sounding platitudes,
while men walked the streets, whose
lives he had commercially ruined? Of , whole-
sale deception for immediate advantages? Of —
of transgressing every law of that unwritten code
whose observance makes society possible and con-
duces no less than the laws inscribed within the
Statute-Book to the solidarity of a State 2 There
are men who have not the great ability of Sir
Henry Parkes who are honoured for their pri-
vate worth alone. There are men in the Parlia-
ment over which Sir Henry “rules,” some few,
and few enough, but enough to preserve that
Parliament from absolutely rotting, who would
perish ere they would allow a single stain to
smirch their fair reputations as mere private
citizens. From the statesman we demand that
fierce, that almost unrelenting integrity which
borders on the austere. It is not enough
that he should be able to tell us what honour is
not. We require that he should know and prac-
tise honour as it is. His life, though private,
should be like hers who aspires to be the wife of
CDesar —above suspicion. His private character
should be as flawless as any human being's can be.
He should never excuse the laches of the citizen
by urging the claims of the statesman. Provided
his own honour were clear as the noonday sun, our
honour would be safe and untarnished in his
keeping. He should disdain to cover the sins of
the man with the mantle of office, and if he some-
times blundered we should feel that it was but
the stumbling of one whose steadfast eyes were
fixed upon the light of high-set stars.
PLAN ENGLISH.
The Only Real Remedy.
Editor Bulletin, —The Press has been in a fer-
ment over the “discovery” of the fact that
manure-factories, known by the title of “ baby-
farms,” exist about Melbourne; that women
saddled with illegitimate children, and even
legitimate ones coupled with misery, hand them
over to these establishments —in some cases ignor-
antly and blindly, on account of the cheapness,
and in other instances with a full expectation of
a fatal result ; that, instead of being Killed in
the comparatively humane fashion which might
be punished by the gallows, the wretched infants
are starved and exposed in every possible way to
death in its most wearisome and horrible form
to the living tomb of corruption born of deliber-
ately-inflicted want, and squalor, and disease, and
foulness, until the end would be a present mercy
even could the shattered frame be doctored into
living for the natural term. They are eloquent
over these horrors, and well they may be, but of
what sort is their eloquence and of what avail 2
It is all very well to shudder at what is evil; it
is quite another thing to act and rectify it. There
is nothing on earth more pitiful to contemplate
than this spectacle of mothers driven by poverty
and ignorance ; nothing more appalling than that
of those cruelly dead to all natural affections ;
nothing more bitterly heartrending than that of such
as are forced by circumstances and the unnatural
shame of maternity—the intention to engage in
which has not been registered in advance —to
trample upon and crush those feelings, trafficking
with feminine ghouls, and purchasing ruin
and destruction for their own flesh and blood.
What, therefore, can be the first thought but to
find a remedy ? And one would fancy that
thoughts, under these conditions, would be
earnest and serious, not mere haphazard sugges-
tions. Yet not a word has been said as to any-
thing which might be more than a slight allevia-
tion of the slightest portion of the evil. We hear,
forsooth, of Morality Associations, and again of a
creche or Foundling Hospital, the latter of some
slight use in its way, no doubt. But it would
chiefly benefit the merely indigent, for those
women who stood in fear of shame would still be
haunted with a knowledge of the child’s where-
abouts and the fear of future complications, and
would largely, in sheer selfish terror, prefer the
death system minus responsibility, as at present
organised by the harpies whose evil deeds have
aroused Melbourne to pious indignation.
The dead are soon forgotten, and de-
velope no likeness which suspicion can me
in evidence; they have no interest in dis-
covering their parentage at, it may be, the most
inconvenient time ; and thus the evil at bottom
would remain untouched. There is only one way to
strike at the root of this national crime, and that is
to retain the marriage contract as a mere arrange-
ment for domestic management, and legitimize
not only all children, but all child-bearings.
For the very germ of the morbid state of mind in
which it is at all possible for a woman to compass
her child’s destruction is this, that the bitterness of
shame and degradation within her mind at the
fear of what the world will say and do, rebounds
in the form of positive hatred of the physical
body of the infant. And this is purely owing to
an artificial state of surroundings. There is no
reason for society to concern itself with the cir-
cumstances of any birth as such. The marriage
contract is a mere civil security for maintenance,
say what anyone will ; everything must be
either intrinsically right or intrinsically wrong,
and the mere fact of a contract directly or in-
directly bearing upon it cannot affect that must.
It does not matter whether a tree is planted under
contract or otherwise—and the land contains it
just as legally; if it were not so, nobody would be
surprised at the grower of an uncontracted-for
tree uprooting it to avoid calumny. And what
holds good of the one case does of the other. It is
simply the present condition of the marriage sys-
tem, &c., which holds out a premium for the ex-
termination of children not begotten under
authorised patronage. When it becomes other-
wise, three-quarters of the desertions, with all
their attendant sufferings, will cease for want of
a purpose.

Centennial Civilisation.
Just upon one hundred years ago—it was in the
May»of 1788 —two sailors of H.M.S. Sirius com-
mitted a common assault upon a man on Shark
Island, just inside the entrance of Sydney Har-
bour. They punched his head and otherwise
cuffed him, and the authorities of the day
awarded them each 500 lashes. The punishment
could not, however, be “ completedthe men
were suffering from scurvy. History repeats
itself. The other day it was sought to fittingly
celebrate the glorious first century of Australian
settlement by flogging a degraded wretch for an
indictable offence on a girl, and the
punishment here, too, fell through, for the man
was suffering from scurvy, but it was inside, not
outside. It was scurvy of the mind. It was his
second flogging. He had already suffered the
nervous tortures incident upon the application of
15 lashes, and he utterly broke down. He was a
highly-strung man, suffered acutely in his mind
beforehand, and, in official language, “gave great
trouble ” as he dreaded the punishment extremely.
Blood was drawn at the second stroke, and
the recent festival received its libation of
human gore. At the tenth stroke the doctor
ordered that the prisoner he given a drink of
water and the flogger was commanded to finish
up the dose by “pretending” to flog so as to
comply with the sentence. The Press, which per-
sists in a strangely studious silence regarding
these matters, reported that “ the scene was a
very painful one.” Painful is no word for it, but
just look at the case! Here was an admittedly
broken-down, nervously-wrecked man condemned
to two years’ imprisonment, but lest he should
sybaritise too luxuriously in gaol he is further
condemned to two floggings of 15 lashes each. To
flog for crimes possibly springing from nervous dis-
order is sheer lunacy. Offences of the nature
for which the man was flogged involve a study of
and an almost supernal acquaintance with the
whole phenomena of the sexual mystery, and an
admission of his guilt might only be tantamount
to an admission of his insanity. But the greatest
evil lies in the fact that the sentence was ordered
to be merely “formally complied with.” The
dogger is instructed to lash a coat or the legs of
the triangle, and thus is the law brought into
contempt. If it is necessary that society should
avenge brutality by brutality why is the judicial
brutality administered only in form 2 Either
the punishment is a deterrent or it is not.
If its shadow is enough, why not go through the
mere form of hanging for murder, and rest
satisfied with the result 2 If brutal sins must be
washed out by brutal punishment, then, Society,
fulfil your mission! Seize with your whetted
teeth the ear of the offender, and chew it off ;
bury your fangs deep in his larynx ; but do not thus
bring scorn and contumely upon your laws. If they
are necessary, administer them. This playing at
retribution is only offering a bonus to daring crime
The truth is that such punishments are fast de-
generating into a farce. Assaults of the most
flagrant and unredeemable nature may be com-
mitted provided the offender is a “ gentleman.”
To the well-attired and the well-connected novice
is denied or visited with corporal punishment. The
lash is no longer of any meaning as regards crime
It is simply an evidence of the social status of
the offender. It proclaims that the criminal
wears a fustian jacket and not a coat of broad-
cloth. If you would sin with impunity, put on a
frock-coat. Your face c ay be sufficient to hang
you, but your coat, carries redemption in its
patrician folds. Herein is the disease and the an-
tidote. No evilly-disposed man should neglect
his wardrobe, or fail to keep on good terms with
Ills tailor.
SI Versus 1130.
The wilted Orange rooster fought what looks like
his last fight at Newtown, Sydney, on Friday,
and by tremendous exertions the draggle-tailed
bird came in ahead by a majority of 81. In the
New South Wales general election of February,
1887, the leading Freetrade candidate scored 1120
votes in advance of his Protectionist rival, and
even the lowest of the three supporters of Parkes
and his policy of assistance to foreign industries
received 822 more suffrages than the badly-
defeated Smith. One year’s experience, however,
of the glorious prosperity which attends on a
Freetrade policy has sufficed to reduce this
majority of 1120 to the miserable total of 81; the
actual strength of the Protectionist vote at the
polls has increased by 600 votes, and against this
600 Freetraders, who 12 months ago were pre-
pared to bet their immortal souls on Parkes,
disappeared from the list of his supporters. But,
while cocscious that their cause is going down-
hill with a velocity almost unexampled in Aus-
tralian politics, the Freetraders mads ever / exer-
tion that men could make to cover the dreadful
falling-off. Abigail, the semi-illiterate cobbler,
who helps to boss a pawnshop with a spread-
eagle title on the brass plate outside, which
charges the working man 200 per cent, for
a loan on his horse and cart, stumped the
electorate aad appealed to the toilers whose blood
Is sucked by his gilded institution to support the
cause which is fast putting all New South Wales
up the spout. The renegade geophagist from
Mudgee raised his old cry that the R.C. vote was
going solid for Protection and that every good
white man who wanted to rile the Pope must vote
for Abbott. 'I he Orangemen, who industriously
propagated the yarn of a great t apal organisa-
tion, were themselves organising, and at a con-
clave held at Newtown they resolved on giving
their unanimous support to the Freetrade candi-
date. The Government also lent a hand by fixing
the polling day for a t‘ riday, when a large number
of the working men, whom interests lie in the
promotion of local instead of British, German, and
Chinese industry, were debarred by their occupa-
tions from voting; and, in addition to this side
blow at the Protectionist cause, they released the
Civil servants —the men who, as a rule, care little
for the country so long as they get their screws re-
gularly and can buy elegant English boots
with facility and despatch—to give a solid vote for
Abbott. Why the Civil servant should get a
holiday in order that he may vote, instead of taking
his chance before or after working hours like any
other man, has never yet been explained, and
why elections should not be held on Saturday, so
that the humble labourer who wants Protection
may have as good a show as the dude who will
probably be sacked if he doesn’t go for Freetrade,
is another unfathomable problem. Yet, with all
these agencies at work, the Freetrade victory was
only the forlorn shadow of the triumph of 12
months ago. The result was so uepressing that it
is more than doubtful if the Grange phalanx will
ever roll up again as a united political force. It
is held together chiefly by the oft-repeated false-
hood that the Pope is the head of the
New fcouth Wales Protectionists, and when
this mendacious bubble bursts, as it goon
must, the unnatural union between re-
ligion and politics will be at an end. In Victoria,
the leading Orangemen are among the heads of
the Protectionist party, and this alone should
show that the ghost of Dutch William has not
necessarily any connection with ihe cheap pants
ana foreign gimoraoks which are manufactured
for the colonial market by the white slaves of
London and Birmingham. Mr. Abbott himself
went back on the unscrupulous bigots who dragged
the spectres of old sectarian feuds from their
graves to fight for the Calico Jemmies of York-
street, and declared that “if other issues had
been brought into the contest it had not been by
him,” The chief apology now put forward by
the Freetraders for the hideous falling off in their
roll-call is the bald old assertion that a
great number of their party did not vote,
while the Protectionists rolled up to the last man,
but this assertion is a palpable lie in view of the
fact that more electors voted last Friday .1. u at
the poll of February, 1887, and the only c ngo
noticeable was in the sentiments of the >■ pie,
who, 12 months ago, were gulled into pi. ing
their trust in Parxes. The only living Free-
trader who has any cause for congratulation over
the Newtown Election is Francis Abigail, who
emerged from the shady halls of his pawnshop to
offer a reward of £5 for the capture of any voter
who was found in the act of personation. The
reward, presumably, was only offered for the
scalp of any personating Protectionist, and as the
chief personators were the Freetraders, it
was not claimed. The election was won
not at Newtown but at Sydney, where wholesale
and shameless manipulation ran up a majority of
over 100, and consequently Ihe Minister of
the pawnshop saves the proffered £6, and adds
it reverently t® the bank account where another
£25, offered under somewhat similar ausp ices, is
still reposing.

About the drollest job ever perpetrated w ith
Victorian public money is that elegant Govern
ment steamer, the Lady Loch. No serious
attempt to explain the raison d'etre of this
novelty was made at the outset, but the public
swallowed it with their usual indifference, and
took it for granted that a Government steamer
was a long-felt want. Perhaps the large ma-
jority believed the Lady Loch to be a fast cruiser
intended to repel Russian invasions, and other-
wise assist the great cause of freedom. Two
j ears’ experience of the movements of this expen-
sive and appropriately-named craft show that she
has no other mission than that of providing
Duncan Gillies and his ministering angels with
water picnics—charged to the Estimates. When
the penny-wise and-pound-wiser Premier needs
rest and recreation, he victual t the Lady Loch
with chicken and champagne, and has a howling
lime on the ocean wave, his grateful colony
squaring the account. From time to tint- there
have been remar. s that this thrifty bachelor in-
tended to create himself an admiral and hoist
his flsg on the Lady Loch, so that he might live
rent free afloat when he wasn’t drawing his salary
ashore. Up to the pre-ent, however, Duncan
has found it more convenient to «eeo on his town
house, and use the steamer as a p:ivate “yot”
merely. He yetted her over to Sydney the other
day—expanses being charged to the Estimates, as
per usual Truly, Duncan might have saved
time by using a special train, also free of charge;
but then he must have paid for his own refresh-
ments at stopping-places, which he avoided by
taking the ocean route. And just here we may
mention that Chief Secretary Dbakin didn’t Cen-
tenniate because he feared to participate in this
last scandal. Young Alfred is but a novice in
political crime—the dread of being bullied by a
virtuous Opposition when “Lady Loch” is next
under discussion kept him in Melbourne after he
found that his superior officer had determined to
go a-s ailing on the never. Possibly Alfred’s con-
science reminded him that his European friend,
Lord Salisbury, has the decency to pay for what he
eats and drinks when travelling just like the
meanest taxpayer. Possibly the still, small voice
whispered to him that the most brazen British
Tory Ministry has never ventured to build a
Government pleasure boat. Anyway, it is stated
as a fact that the Chief Secretary of Victoria re-
fused to aid and abet Premier Gillies in this last
wanton waste of other people’s cash. Let the
Victorians rouse themselves from their contented
slumber and keep their eye on the free-victualling
owner of the Lady Loch. The opposition
which Deakin affects to fear has no existence ex-
cept in Hansard’s reports. When Mr. Tommy
Bent and his followers raise a sham rumpus over
one job it is only to divert attention from a
greater one in which they are aiding their friend
the enemy.

The Sydney Sunday-School children have had
their Centennial treat, but, according to all
accounts, it was a severe frost. They gathered
at the Agricultural Show Ground on Ith February
and, after marching about for hours in the fierce
sun, were gathered together in a heap without a
particle of shelter opposite the old grand-stand—
the new one having blown down. The aristo-
cracy, the nobility, the clergy, and the people
who were good enough, upon payment, to mix
with them, were accommodated with shade and
seats and shelter in the stand itself, but the chil-
dren. who had already done a good day’s work,
were herded together in the pitiless downpour of
the unmitigated sunlight and compelled to recite
the Lord’s Prayer and sing nine long hymns,
which, when printed, make quite a respectable
pamphlet—we have a copy of this precious pro-
duction. But this was only a tithe of their suffer-
ings. Bishop Barry, from the shelter of the
grand-stand, lectured the poor little beggars about
Ch istian endurance, and the Secret of England’s
Greatness, for along, dreary time —his speech lasted
over 10 minutes—and Lord Carington had also a
lictle piece of Vice-regal twaddle for their special
edification. We must, however, in justice to the
latter, state that, unlike Barry, he showed some
consideration for the children, and said as little
as possible. Then the youngsters were informed
that they might go and eat; that is, each school
was granted hind permission to provide refresh-
ments for its own scholars, hut the Government,
which had recently spent thousands of pounds in
entertaining a lot of titled loafers and travelling
bagmen with second-rate handles to their names,
had not a penny to spend upon the creature com-
forts of the poor little brats who had been march-
ing, and howling, and praying in the remorseless
glare of an Australian midsummer sun, to lend a
little sanctified glitter to the tawdry celebration
of the “ Day We Were Lagged.” A lot of schools
could not afford refreshments for their scholars.
The money had to come from somewhere, and
some schools were too poor to feed all their
youngsters. At all events, the cost of a public
event was thrown upon private charity. Reliable
authority bears testimony to the fact that a lot of
children fainted, and a great number went home
without refreshments at all. Some schools were
very indignant, as, had they known the
intention of the Government, they could have
made arrangements, even if upon no other line,
by staying away. But what a frightful satire
was this upon the Church’s most cherished insti •
tution—that of prayer, 'i his is calculated to bring
the chief bulwark of the State —religion—into
contempt. thousands of children recite the
Lord’s Prayer, and ask trustingly for “ daily
bread,” with the expectation of getting a currant-
bun and a bottle of ginger-beer, and they get
neither a stone nor a drink of water. If the state
is anxious to preserve the inviolability of faith it
will be necessary either to plank the “grub, ” or
make some arrangement with Providence for a
supply. To allow these quickly-apprehensive
little intellects to discredit the power of prayer
is calculated to shake the very foundations
of our national greatness. Perhaps, however,
this is another of the moral aspects of Freetrade.
Dear Bulletin, —The pen was never
employed to urge a mere noble and deserving
cause than that of the starving unemployed of
London. I humbly congratulate you on your
eloquent appeal to true hearted Australians to
mark the centenary of Australia by ministering to
the dire necessities of their ragged fellow-men,
who, in this season of our festivity, are without
help or pity starving in Modern Babylon, How-
ever, “ solid pudding against empty words,”
and it now remains for all men possessing a
“ripe and good heart” to practically exem-
plify their desire to relieve their suffering
brothers, who are tasting Tory coercion in re-
sponse to their bitter and justifiable cry for help.
Australians ! if you have pity, if you possess a
particle of manly feeling, give sterling evidence of
it now, and thereby repudiate the acquiescence
(implied by silent apathy) in the shameful actions
of British (!) rulers, who, scintillating in pompous
magnificence and rolling in abundance, laugh at
the calamities of hunger-stricken London poor.
If The Bulletin will receive subscriptions, I
firmly believe that the hungry will be fed, and a
stream of sunlight from Australia will be shed on
the wretched so-called homes of these, our miser,
able English brothers.— A. Rickard, Paddington,


HISTORY OF BOTANY BAT.
One of the heroic stories of the period is
thatcf “the Scotch Martyrs,” who were trans-
ported In 1794 They were Messrs. Mnir, Palmer,
Gerald, Margarot, and Sklrving, and the story of
these men is a standing comment on the British
civilisation and enlightenment of the day. At
about this time England bad just goaded the
Americans and Irish into rebellion, and begun her
career of arms in India under Wellesley,
the period of fraud being over. She had
founded New South Wales, and frustrated
the designs of Providence by making Australia
the abode of all the vile growths that her own
grim social and political codes had called into
existence. Having successfully created such a
receptacle for vice and crime, it is instructive to
see the class of people she sent out to fill it.
# • *
Muir was a Scotch barrister, and when an
association was formed in London to bring about
certain reforms in Parliament by constitutional
means, his sympathies were enlisted. He helped
to form a branch of the “Filends of the People”
in Glasgow. All the members subscribed to a
declaration of adherence to the established
Government, and claimed to ba acting merely
within their constitutional rights. The Glasgow
Association reprinted seme tracts Issued by the
Lot don branch, and Mr. Muir was thereupon
charged with “ sedition." The others were in-
dicted with him, and the trial Is one of the scan-
dals of history. The ruffianly Brabonrne helped
to try the cases, and all the Court influence was
worked on and off the Bench to secure a convic-
tion When the accused left their hotel to attend
the Court the horses were taken from the chaise,
and an applauding crowd took their places.
Arches and wreaths were held over Margarot as
he passed along the street, bearing such words as
“ Reason,” “ Liberty,” and so forth inscribed
thereon. The Lord Provost, with some con-
stables and a “ press-gang,” met the procession,
smashed the emblems, and took many into cus-
tody. There was never any doubt about the ver-
dict. Margarot was sentenced to 14 years’
transportation beyond the seas, Muir to seven
years, and the others to various terms.
• » •
An appeal was made to the Commons on
behalf of Muir, and the Right Hon. William
Adam moved and Mr. Fox seconded an address
to the Crown on his behalf. The Government
whipped up its party and defeated the motion,
and the Annual Register for 1794 says that on
February 10 ; - “ Messsrs. Muir, Margarot, Skirv-
ing, and Palmer were removed from Newgate In
a post coach and four, attended by two King’s
messengers. We learn that they were taken on
board vessels bound to Botany Bay.” Gerald
followed a few months later. The Secretary of
State charged the gaolers of these men to “ keep
a watchful eye over their conduct,” and to search
their effects diligently for seditious literature
before allowing them to land. Brick huts
along the side of Sydney Cove were assigned for
their residences. Muir afterwards lived at
Hunter's Hill, which he named after his patri-
monial estate in Scotland, and Gerald bought land
where the Botanic Gardens now are in Sydney.
They made repeated applications to be allowed to
return home, but the vindictive spirit that sent
them forth dreaded freedom of opinion too much
to accede to these requests. Gerald, who was a
man of amiable and refined character, died in
1796, and was buried in his little plot of ground
at his own request. Sklrving only survived him
three days. “A dysentery "was the apparent
cause of his death,” says Collins, “but his heart
was broken. Amongst us he was a pious, honest,
worthy character. In this settlement his political
principles never manifested themselves, but all
his solicitude seemed to be to evince himself the
friend of human nature. Reguiescat in pace,”
adds this good Collins, feelingly, A “friend of
human nature ” was more likely to rest peacefully
under the ground than on it in Botany Bay at
that time.
* * *
When the story of these prosecutions be-
came known In France and America, the newly-
awakened popular sentiment cf those countries
was deeply stirred. The whole business was ore
of barefaced and shameless persecution. The late
Chief Justice Cockburn has stated that the jury
in Muir's case was packed by Lord Jeffrey of
“ Edinburgh Review ” fame ; the former never re-
ferred to this iniquitous case without horror.
Muir’s treatment In prison, we are ex-
pressly told, was vindictive and cruel.
He employed his time after reaching fydney in
alleviating the miseries of the more abandoned of
the convicts, and in protesting against being
treated himself as a felon. The speeches of Adams
and Fox had been read, and honest men had felt
their blood boil at the story they told. Washing-
ton, In America, interested himself on behalf of
this sufferer for liberty, end a vessel called the
“ Otter” was fitted out to enable him to escape
from the colony. She arrived in Port Jackson
under pretence of trade, and on February 11 Mr.
Muir was smuggled on board, and made his es-
cape out to sea. The ship got safely away, but
was wrecked off California All were drowned
save Muir and two sailors. They followed the
shore-line for four thousand miles on foot to reach
Panama. At Vera Cruz, Muir shipped as a sailor
on board a Spanish man-of-war going home. But
capricious fate followed him, for the ship was
captured by a British frigate, and Mu’r, in the
conflict, had the top of his head shot away. When
the boarding-pan y came cn board one of the men
lifted the apparently lifeless body of Muir
in his arms to throw it overboard with
the rest, when an officer saw a Bib'e
in his clasped hand. He opened it, and knew
Muir’s name as that of a dear old friend and
schoolfellow. He was carefully examined, found
stiil living, and sent to the hospital at Cadiz.
Here he recovered, and the French Directory,
hearing of him again, invited him to
Bordeaux, where be was entertained at a ban-
quet by 500 French gentlemen. Then he went to
Paris, where he was publicly welcomed. He rose
to speak at the banquet given him there, and
fainted from excitement and weakness. He was
taken to Chantilly, where he died In 1798, the
French Government decreeing a State funeral to
this early colonist, of whom Australian political
leaders Eve never mentioned the name. The
story adds that a message was sent to the mar-
tyr’s pan nts, “ who soon after died of grief at his
loss.” His age was 33.

This is a romantic story, which will be
printed in school-books and told to every Aus-
tralian schoolboy before another generation
passes away; and the lives of these men will be
quoted as lessons from which the Australian
public spirit of the future may draw sustenance
and vigorous life. Young Australia will learn
from such stories, as well as from its own history
when candidly 'old, why this Continent cannot
consent to remain an appanage Of a country which
has progressed much and far since these things
were done, but which Is kept back in the race of
modern development under a dead weight of un-
wieldy interests, vested rights, and inherited cus-
toms, by which Australia need only be tram-
melled as long as her people please. It is the
names of men like Muir and Margarot that will be
taught to schoolboys by-and-bje, and not the
names of squalid gaolers and convict-officers who
masquerade in Australian history as our early
officials and governors. Siberia has no more
romantic story than that of Thomas Muir.
* * ♦
Margarot had other work to do ; and the
mention of his name brings our story back to the
trading officers of the New South Wales Corps,
and the events which culminated in what is nobly
called the “ Deposition of Governor Bligb.” Mar-
garot served out the whole period of his 11 years’
sentence in the colony, and it was two years later
before he was allowed to get away. He was
present all through the latter 16 years of the
Corps’ career of wholesale robbery and spoliation,
and from his evidence given before the Committee
of the House of Commons on the state of the
colony we are able to draw unexceptionable in-
formation as to the officers' ways and means.
Something has already been said about tbelr
usury, their daylight robbery, and their mono-
poly &f*trade and business of every kind and this
will serve to throw light on what is to follow.
We will look at Mr. Margaret’s evidence again
later on.
* * *
The case of Governor Bligh has been made
one of the difficult points of Australian history.
The reason for this is apparent at a Blance. From
what has gone before, the unprejudiced reader
will be able to glean a fair idea of the men who
exercised early authority in the colony, and of
the officers of the New South Wales Corps in par-
ticular. What he has read will not have pre-
pared him to find these persons leading a popular
movement, and defying the King's representa-
tives in the name, and on behalf of, a suffering
people. Yet this Is the character these men have
unblusbingly given themselves. Facts have been
distorted, and feeble psrverters of Australian re-
cords have been corrupted, either by a pander’s
bribe or by native stupidity, to repeat the story
the officers and their friends have shamelessly
put forward. The time has come to change all
that, and to show that the claim of ” our first
families,” in this instance, is based on hypocritical
cowardice and false pretences alone. In clearing
up this moot point in the squalid history of Botany
Bay, as in the others elsewhere given, the present
writer has collected facts from all sources, and has
putthemtrgether in their properorder. This simple
yet novel arrangement ef Australian records puts
the case before the reader in the plainest and
most candid way. He can then iudgefor himself.
•
The conflict between the Corps and the
Governors, as we have seen, did not begin with
Bligh. It began with Phillip, and every Governor
after him felt the consequences of any inter-
ference with the nefarious practices of the officers.
Governor Hunter, whose intentions on the whole
were much better than his grammar, incurred
their special enmity. Macarthur went home to
work up influence against him at headquarters,
and his machinations led to Hunter’s recall,
Captain King was commissioned ostensibly
to relieve Hunter, who merely gave up
his appointment temporarily. As soon as
that respectable man was “crimped” on
board, as it were, it became known that
King’s appointment was a permanent one. Hun-
ter went home and was allowed to die in neglect.
King was a typical sea captain, fall of strange
oaths, and irascible to a degree. Of course he
quarrelled with the Officers. He filled a despatch-
box with elaborate reports on their misconduct*
They bribed a London pickpocket to pick
the lock, look out the documents, and put In
old newspapers in their stead. W hen the box
was opened in London the Duke cf Portland
doubtless thought the uncouth sailor-governor
had blundered, as it were, in a passing moment of
intoxication, Mr. Macarthur wanted to fight a
duel with his colonel, and King sent him home
under arrest.
* * •
The real nature of the quarrel between
the officers and the Governors came out when
King gave certain emancipated convicts the right
to sell rum. This was wounding the officers in
the apple of the eye, so to speak. They protested
against this monstrous interference with their
privileges, and Major Jphuston, who was wise in
council as we have seen him brave after battle,
objected In these gallant words “I do not look
upon convicts conditionally emancipated as amen-
able to the articles of war, or on a footing with
those who are considered the respectable. Inhabi-
tants of this colony, nor do I Imagine that I could
justify my conduct were I to sanction such a
measure.” This was in 1803, and it expresses
the jealousy felt by the officers in regard to the
emancipated convicts, who were beginning to
compete with them in trade. For 40 years after,
attempts were made to keep the line of demar-
cation rigidly defined.
« * *
The officers persecuted King until they
drove him out of the country. Their attacks took
the meanest and most imsoldierlike form. They
wrote rude and indecent verses, and dropped
them in a cowardly way about his premises. They
circulated clumsy lampoons from hand to hand,
of which the venom was more apparent than the
wit. One bard was inspired to sing thus : -
“ For Infamous acts from my birth I'd an itch,
My fate I foretold but too true ;
Though a rope I deserved, which is justly my
due,
I shall actually die in a ditch.
And be damned.”
It will be scan that the officers kept an eye on
Jack Ketch even when they burst into song.
The verses of these people were as bad as their
moral characters. They secured their point at
last in making King “ humbly implore leave of
absence to submit his conduct” for home consi-
deration. He got it, and Bligh took his place.
Melbourne Leader had an article on
“ The Analysis of a Tear." I) quite depends on
how you pronounce it, but as the Leader says
there ia soda in it we are sure of its orthoepy.
We will accept that journal’s authority oa tho
subject without a moment’s hesitation.
Joy! “Sydney May all,” apparently an
English visitor, writing to the Melbourne Herald,
says : “ For all-round smartness, for the strength
of its splendid satires, and for the Aristarohlan
power of its iconoclastic leaders there is, perhaps,
no paper in the world ahead of the Sydney Bul-
letin, and few, if any, that can range alongside
it.” The same enlightened man states that he
has heard many of our native nobility speak of
“ tryantulas ’—but that’s nothing. In the very
best circle 3 they a r e “ tryantelopes."
CORRESPONDENCE
A, Martin : The reason why the Adelaide sea-
men gave way in the recent strike for the amalgamation of
the Masters and Mates’ Union with that of the seamen was
this : A large portion of them distrusted the masters and
mates, who had ratted on them before, and the Melbourne
and Sydney Unions completely agreed with them in this
feeling. Consequently, the more advanced men, who saw
that the masters and mates were as much wage-slaves
though on a higher plane, as the seamen, were over-ruled,

How She Came There.
(NUNQUAM'S THEORY OF FEMALE HVOLUTION.)
There came to the making of woman,
On an April morning bright,
When shower and shine were intermixed,
A sly, malicious sprite.
With radiance of the sunbeam,
With fickleness of the wind,
With treachery from the ocean waves,
He fashioned a female mind.
He moulded her flesh of rose and cream,
Of jewels he formed her eyes,
And coloured them fair with living blue,
Filched from the Southern skies.
He gave her the kitten’s joy in play,
And the cat’s revengeful claws,
And the peacock's pride in vain display.
To make her love applause.
Then he whispered, “ No worse I’ll make her.
For fear, by some mad caprice.
She tempts me in wrath to break her,
My tricksy masterpiece 1 ’
And again he said, and winked his eye,
‘ 1 No fairer 111 form this maid,
Lrst, caught by my own devioaejsly,
I learn to love the jade.”
So he gave her some silk to rustle,
A wobble and mince, for style,
A number eleven bustle,
And a patent, self acticg smile,
With a bonnet, a muff, and a tippet neat,
A satchel, sun-shade, and fan ;
Then dropped her into the world, complete.
To make things lively for Man.
A Parliamentary measure—a full pint.
Barefaced people— actors and priests.
“ Pastoral Enterprise ’’—making collec-
tions.
A mane liquor law —the closing of the
Sydney public-houses at 11 o’clock. Yours truly,
J). Hooligan,
“ Several thousand tons of old horae-shoea
exported from America to China to make gun-
barrels." Sure to kick.
Haynes, M.P., wants to call N.S.W.
“ New Holland,” on the ground that it is ruled by
the ghost of Dutch William.
Over a thousand million of eggs annually
imported by the D sited Kingdom. No wonder*
Her Gracious prefers privacy to publicity.
The Cooktown (Q.) Independent has gob
the war-scare bad. It states that “ Russia baa
massed 250,000 infantry, 25,000 cavalry, and 800
guns on the Australian frontier.”
The S. M. Herald says it is known that
the Queen is going to make a Jubilee present to
the nation. Another Prince Consort, perhaps f
or may be “ nation” is a misprint for Nation.
From a Sydney religious paper:-—“Mr.
Walker delivered an address on temperance, andl
also made an experiment with bear, which, on the
whole, proved very satisfactory.” Of such are
the Kingdom of Heaven.
Auckland (N,Z.) is close up on the hand
waggon of civilisation. Her principal streets arc
n,ow lighted by electricity and she has 504 sub]
scribers to her telephone exchange. Her magis-
trates hear 210 debt-cases every Friday,
A large number of Sydney citizens dis-
played on the fronts of their houses and offices
during the recant Centennial illuminations, tho
figures 100, It was marvellous how often tho
wind caused those figures to look like lOU, out

A Taranaki (N. Z ) settler writing to a>
local journal says “We have a Col-Commando
ant at a large salary, with all his attendants and
expenses, kept simply to protect our insignificance
and poverty, in the shape of dishonored bills,,
mortgages, and bad debts, from the Russians.”
How’s this for the high military and naval
circles ?
A Victorian up-country newspaper puts
an obituary thus : “ We have again to record the
death of Mr. .” This reminds us of Mr. W.
Pearson, of Kllmany Park, Vie., who. in writing
to the Minister for Lands on a mysterious disease
which had attacked his cattle, said that they had
“ commenced dying again, and continued doing
so fer about a fortnight." These two statements
are worthy of Tipperary.

Men don't believe in a devil now aa their fathers

But who the devil is doing the work the devil

#* * *
“ Faust ” is in possession of the stage at
Sydney Gaiety, and MepMstopheles is in posses-
sion of Faust, and spreads his tail over the habit-
able globe. A lot of new and beautiful scenery
has been painted and upholstered for the occasion,
and a well-trained chorus adds greatly to the at-
tractiveness of the show. Mr. Dampler, with
carnage in his eye, plays the part of Mephis-
topheles, and, from the moment of bis first ap-
pearance, when he comes in chewing thunder and
presents his fiendish card to the doddering
Faustus, to the closing scene, he is an unalloyed
success. He is calm and dignified in every
action, and even in his most malignant moments
is all that a gentlemanly devil ought to be.
Faustus, the old philosopher, is played by Mr.
Baker, an d his successor, Faust, the dude who is
born again only to be dropped howling into Ge-
henna, by Mr, Boothman. We have, on more than
one occasion, been called upon to haul the great hogs-
head of charity over the first-named gentleman,
but as Faustus he requires no such consideration.
Mr, Boothman is also very good in spots, but be
suffers somewhat by comparison with Mephisto-
pheles, and he hardly looks miserable enough in
the last act while going down with incandescent
coat-tails, to spend a hot Forevermore. Most
men would wear an aspect of considerate annoy-
ancs under such circumstances, and if Mr. Booth-
man could contrive to put more smothered ferocity
into his visage, and would look more like a rise
in the price of gas mixed with pre-eminence In
grief and a desire to attack a full-grown lion with
a hoe, he would give considerably more satisfac-
tion to the boys who gnaw green apples in
the pit. Miss Dam pier’s Margaret is nearly
perfect, and her acting in the psison scene
made one lady we’p in the circle, to the serious
injury of a valuable complexion which was
stronger on one side than the otter. Miss Rose
Dampler perpetrates a pretty solo with success;
Mr. Holloway, as Brander, is shot after he has
done some singing, whereas he ought to be shot
before; Mr. Leston does some good comedy as
Siebel, and Miss Julia Merton achieves a glaring
victory as an old nurse of the description of Gamp
let loose. The scenery and mechanical accessories
in “ Faust" are beyond praise, and unless the per-
verted taste of a Sydney audience can’t be satisfied
without Mephistopheles dancing a break-down
and wearing a tall, the drama ought to have a
long run,
** * *
The resurrection of the“ Mikado” at Sydney
Royal promises to be a profitable speculation for
somebody. During the long career of the. poten-
tate who wants to make the punishment fit the
crime, he has torn up human probability by the
roots all over the known world, and in every land
where the bird of freedom roosts upon the tree of
life he is known and respected. But still we re-
gret to say that the “ Mikado 11 at the Royal is
not quite what he was twelve months ago. The
new Yum-Yum, Miss Leonora Braham, Is beauti-
ful enough, and sings sweetly, and looks all that
the Lord High Executioner could ask in the way
of a bride, but she puts a painful waddle into her
little feet when engaged in locomotion, and if her
stride is purely Japanese then our washerwoman
comes from the land of the rising sun. When she
stands still her acting is admirable, and she looks
young and picturesque, but when she trots round
about with the other two little maids from school
the has the stalk of an ancient prophet with the
gout. Maggie Moore, too —with all reverence be
it spoken—has grown somewhat considerable in
dimensions, and is not so noble-looking a ruin as
Alice Barnett. Her voice is as sweet as ever, and
her acting almost without a flaw, but somehow
the part of Katisha has become associated with
the towering female who used to gaze down scorn-
fully from her tremendous altitude, and who
looked, even in her calmest moments, as if she
could tread all the geography out of Asia and
pound Japan flat with her feet. Any unplea? ant
remarks which we have ever made re"
garding Miss Colborne-Baber, however, are
hereby withdrawn, that lady’s impersonation of
Pitti-Sing being splendid throughout. Mr.
Edwin Kelly is a fine Mikado, and his noble-
lacking potentate—ln the eloquent words of the
advt. —supplies a long-felt want, and
Mr. Howard Vernon seldom gets less than two
encores for his song, “ I’ve got ’em on the list."
The tailor and tame executioner is probably the
best character in the cast, and without him the
“Mikado” would be almost as void as a son of
Jacob without the awful nose which the heirs of
that ancient patriarch have carried through the
rolling centuries of history. Mr. Woodfleld plays
Pooh-Bah with his old vigour, and Mr. Duncan
Young drives his chariot over the mangled corpse
of criticism as the minstrel, Nanki-Poo. As we
write, the “Mikado" has only been in Sydney
two days, and already the small sons cf a gun
who sit in the gutters and sell newspapers and
matches, have begun to fake up strange, weird
versions of Ko-Ko’s little list, and girls with bang
tails hanging down their sketchy-looking backs
have commenced to whop the time-payment piano
and sing that they have been “ Taken from the
County Jail.” One little female who lives next
door to us did this last night for four hours
straight ahead.

It doesn’t pay to be an ordinary vulgar
thief now-a-days. There was a time, long cen-
turies ago, when thieves wore gold and gems and
had slathe s of property and lived in terrific style
until they fell into the hands of the ancient police,
and then they were generally boiled, or else tied
up in a bag with seven oats and a snake, and a
quart of assorted scorpions and spiders, and a
pint of cockroaches, and a few rats, and a jug of
ants, and the whole lot was kerosened and set on
fire and then dropped into a river, but unhappily
that romantic era has fled. The thief of the pre-
sent day, unless he happens to be a politician, is a
miserable, rusty individual with a mouldy hat,
who hangs for hours round a back-door in a back
street, and is finally rewarded by the chance of
capturing the scrag end of a ham and bolting
three miles with it under a blazing sun. The
“ Forty Thieves,” at Sydney Criterion, however,
belong to the old species, the kind that used to
blow a trumpet while they were lifting the petty
cash, and who, when they had been and gone and
done it, would depart leisurely on horseback with
a thousand menials behind them carrying a ton of
diamonds to their secluded haunt in the forest.
They were an assortment of the maddest of
Arabian dudes, and when they weren’t embez-
zling or splitting a widow down the baok and
hanging the two halves of her np to dry, they
spent their time in singing comic songs which
weren’t invented till a thousand years
further on in the vasty subsequent, and in
dancing with the police and authorities and hold-
ing orgies which turned Arabia upside down, and
covered the silent desert with empty bottles.
They enjoyed life while it lasted amid a wilder-
ness of lovely scenery, and sang sweet melodies,
and made love to pretty girls, and chopped up
passers-by into small hash, and never went to
church or gave a cent to an orphan, and finally
they were scalded to an untimely end by a bounc
ing slavey of the ancient time. They make a
go gaous burlesque, but they were sadly deficient
in moral principle when they were alive, and we
have our doubts as to where they have gone to.
Mr. Robert Brough, who, we are glad to note,
seems to be quite recovered from his long illness,
brings down the premises nightly as Ali Baba.
Miss Fanny Robina, attired like Solomon in all
his glory as he appeared before he fell into the
hypochondriac stage of his existence, represents
All’s son Ganem, a young man of loose and fishy
habits, and trills like a nightingale, or some other
bird that we don't know the name of, and Mr.
Royce plays Hassarao, the robber chief. Owing
to the heat we can’t say any more just now. No
one can do justice to a subject when he is perspir-
ing as we are.

We fell violently into Sydney Academy
of Music on Monday night and stayed there as
long as we could. The nigger has long since
palled upon oar weary soul, and the day is not far
off when we will abjure his coal-coloured coun-
tenance and all his works, but for the present we
are doing our best to hold up. The accession of
Mr. W. B, Warner has made the Federals a good
deal more amusing than they have been for some
time past, and Horace Bent and Sam Keenan have
fixed up two of those peculiar farces in which one
nigger jumps on another’s hat, and the rest of the
action consists in a small coloured man putting

Poor Amery’s departure has left a blank In the
Academy combination, and Charles Fanning is a
woeful substitute for the Alf. Lawton of old, but
otherwise the company is about as good
as a minstrel show can be in this world. Perhaps
they will do better in the next, but we have our
suspicions on this point.

Messrs. Meats and Donovan met at the
Bondi Aquarium, on Saturday, for “ a mounted
sword contest,” and hacked at each other with
sharp pointed weapons till Meats was cut open in
several places, and was in imminent danger of
becoming dead meat. There was little science in
the show, but the men tore round on a pair of
terrified horses and hit out at each other’s legs
until gore flowed in several directions, and at last
a scared referee suggested to a demented police-
man that he had better haul the blood-
thirsty pair apart, if he didn’t want
somebody to be killed. He hauled them
apart accordingly, and the much-damaged
Meats was removed to the hospital, while the
crowd hissed and hooted Donovan, and mani-
fested a desire to go for him. It is not yet known
whether any more shows of the kind will be per-
mitted in Sydney, but, anyhow, we would advise
Mr. Donovan and Mr. Meats to give up this sir
of thing. In a country where people are liable
to be hanged for 22 different sins mounted sword
contests are too risky.

George Rignold still tows the same vener-
able pageant along at Her Majesty’s (Sydney.)
** * *
Essie Jenyus, the sole support of a sick
company, has made her first SHakespearean at
tempt in Melbourne, opening proceedings as
Juliet at the Bijou. Immediately upon her re-
turn from a certain historic trip to Europe she
played at the local Royal, and at that time vivid
memories of Mary Anderson, Ellen Terry, and
Miss Eastlake were entangled In her fair young
brain. Since then Essie has arranged her dis-
ordered impressions and become a clever exponent
of the imitative art. There is no lurking sneer
in that last sentence. With a wide tract of water
separating her from the actresses mentioned,
Miss Jenyns is fairly entitled to be considered a
star, whose borrowed brightness is set off by the
gloomiest company that ever talked blank verse
with a twang. Anyway, it is no small
thing to construct a Juliet—original or
otherwise—such as now draws good houses at
the Bijou, and though a London audience might
find Miss Essie’s performance too reminiscent, it
doesn’t follow that she will never start her own
business and achieve some measure of solid fame.
Just in the meantime Juliet might renounce an
Anderaonian habit of fetching up notes from the
deepest recesses of her dear little chest, and let-
ting them off at Romeo like dynamite explosions
—also, she might keep her eyes under close re-
straint. Her laboured baritone often kills the
text, and her glances seldom hit the bull’s-eye. In
that ball-room scene the ill-starred Romeo couldn’t
possibly catch his Juliet's eye unless he climbed
up a pole to intercept her line of vision, while
the mashed maid’s exit, with her gaze intently
fixed on nothing at all, is of an epileptic
character. These are the most easily effaced
blo.s on an effective plotora carefully worked up,
and showing a hundred skilful touches. There is
power and charm (and plenty of it) about this
Juliet, though she overpostures, overgushes, and
overlooks the parties she is supposed to be ad-
dressing. Miss Jenyns has caught every trick
and gesture of the actresses she studied, and re-
produces them with a graceful fidelity which
stamps her as a clever girl. We’ll tell her so—
You have a fetching face,
And hair so brown and glossy,
You’re full of studied grace,
And genius, too—in posse.
So, if you keep your head,
Sweet lady, smart and dressy,
In time it shall be said
That genius is in esse.
Of the rest, silence. If the leading lady can beep
her shaky company on their legs through a legiti-
mate season, she deserves well of them. There is
every indication that the
task will be accomplished.

Melbourne Alexandra
is finding a temporary tenant
in Mr. Harry St. Maur, who
has set up the “Arabian
Nights” at reduced prices.
This is the old, old story of a
loving husband enjoying one
solitary spree and fitting on
the horns cf a dilemma
through three acts, and it
contains enough St. Maur to
withstand the murderous on-
slaught of a company
mostly dug out of the
bowels of the earth. A minor extenuating cir-
cumstance is found in the risky character of a
“ Gutta Percha Girl.” Without giving ocular
demonstration of her flexibility, this coy maiden
smokes a cigarette, liquors up, and makes ceru-
lean remarks in a style which is improving as im-
pressive. Under happier conditions “ Arabian

“Dorothy” and Nellie Stewart—equally
charming productions in their respective spheres
keep Melbourne Princess’s in a chronic state of
boom. Now that cur young Australian prima
donna (see advt.) has put her lily forefinger upon
the pulse of the people, and found its beat strong
and true, she wears a look of easy contentment.
Any first-night doubts about the improved
quality cf Miss Nellie’s voice have vanished, but,
as an actress, she doesn’t let herself half go in
“ Dorothy." The Royal Pantomime has been
granted another v eek's grace, closing this Friday
instead of last. When the poor Pant, was almost
past praying for, they shook it up a bit,
and brightened its declining days with a further
infusion of Miss Florence Coventry and John
Gourlay. At the Opera House, Professor Kennedy
is “mesmerising” the same old shabby crowd
night after night, before audiences which are
partly cash and the rest In bills. The Age took
up this contemptible show in all seriousness and
published a maudlin notice, dealing with mes-
meric phenomena, hypnotic trances, quasi cata-
lepsy, &c.

Phil Beck returns to England in April.
This will cause lamentation and woe among the
love-sick maidens who haven’t seen Philip in his
plain, everyday state. If it will assist them to
bear the blow we would mention that this young
man is over 40 years of age and by no means
divinely beautiful In front of the footlights. He
looks best under the influence of slow music.

But a few short years ago the merest
sentiment utter id on the stage, having reference
to Royalty, would biiog down the house, but now,
no matter how glowing the “gag,” not a
“ hand ’’ is given. In “In the Ranks ” a sentiment
is put into the mouth of Mrs. Buzzard. It is in
the Fourth Act, where she finds her son Joe at
drill in the barrack-yard ; giving him a maternal
hug he exclaims, “ You mustn’t do that as I am
now the Queen’s property.” “Well,” quoth the
old lady, “ she’s a mother herself, and has a
mother’s heart for her son, I suppose.” Uttered

“ Revenge ” or “ Sentenced to Death ”
has been produced at the Theatre Royal, Adelaide,
and for genuine sensationalism and crying villainy
this drama takes the cake. All the characters
have a bad time of it. There is a rich landlord
who wishes to destroy the happiness of one of his
tenants, a farmer, by endeavouring to run away
with his wife. The farmer objects to this inter-
ference, and there is a row. The villain, for
revenge, accuses the agriculturist of stealing some
bank-notes from him, but through the smartness
of an old gentleman, who is always hard-up
and “requires the price of a pint,” he finds
them in the depths of his own pocket. Then two
children, who are very much alike, get mixed up
considerably, and for a long period their parentage
Is in doubt. Then there is a robbery and at-
tempted murder, and an innocent man Is sen-
tenced to be strung up, an idea he does not like,
and as the police are either out of court for a
drink or having a sleep the prisoner has little
difficulty in escaping from the dock and biding in
a churchyard. Here there are a few more fights,
and the thirsty old boy is precluded from having
any more drinks in this world as he gets shot and
dies repenting. There are a lot of other howling
situations which are too numerous to describe.
Mr. Herbert Flemming, Mr, B. N. Jones, Miss
Morris, and some other capable artistes are re-
duced to take part in this dismal drama, which,
however, has been drawing well. The large
audiences which nightly fill Garner’s Theatre
testify to the popular programmes presented by
Tommy Hudson, whose riches must now be untold.

A Sydney dramatic critic, writing of W.
J. Holloway’s appearance at the Bijou, Mel-

ten years.

The very latest :
11 Well, gentlemen," he said, “ I remember once, I was
fearfully pushed for a ballet-t-ir). A ballet was down in the
bills, and I must have one girl that could dance ; hut the
onlyrea dancer in the ehow had sprained her ankle and
couldn't possibly go on. Well, I telegraphed and engaged
one ; she was usually a prince or something in burlesque,
hut she said she could do it, and I had to take her. She
came on the stage at rehearsal pretty well got up—-nice
tights, good form, everything apparently all right. I was
about to cor gratulate her when I noticed that she wore a
pair of spectacles. ‘ That is ridiculous,’ said I. ‘What? 1
said she. ‘ Those spectacles,' said I: ‘ a ballet girl in spec-
tacles is impossible.' ‘ All right, manager,’ said she. ‘ I’m
ready to throw up this job at any minute. I hope I have
some native refinement and modesty. I have taken eft'
pretty much everything else for the purpose of appearing in
this play, but I am going to draw the line av the spectacles,'
and the fun of it was that instead of the thing destroying
us, it took the place by storm. Nothing was talked about
but my ballet-girl in spectacles. It was a novelty, you see,
and we did grand business night after night.

Mlsa Florence Meyer, of Melbourne,
pianiste and composer, has created a great sensa-
tion In Vienna. Bland Holt declines to out hia
hair. A correspondent informs us that in a cer-
tain company playing somewhere in Australia one
cf the leading gentlemen has been doing some-
thing he oughtn’t to, and a circumstance which
he doesn’t expect Is likely to transpire in conse-
quence. This item is necessarily rather vague on
account of the libel law. Little Josef Hoffman,
infant phenomenon on the piano, objects to visit
the homes of England’s aristocracy because the-
ladies cut off locks of his hair and tickle him.
The duchesses will have to find some one else tu
tickle —but we won’t mention names. George
Leitch, of “Harbour Lights” and “Human
Nature,” is doing a tear round the N.Z,
sounds for the good of his health. We had
a friend once who went round there and was
never heard of any more, and if George comes
across his bones he will please send them along.
J. R. Greville, the well-known actor, is said to be
worth £30,000. Ssme day Anarchy will come and
Greville will have to divide up. An English lord
drifted in behind the scenes at a Melbourne
theatre the other night. He came out again very
suddenly, and told some one who Eeemed to be
close behind him hot to do it again. The
amphibious and much-travelled R. S. Smyth
has turned up from England by the Aorangi
after doing South America, He intends to>
pilot Max O'Rell through Australia shortly.
While Nellie Stewart was in England, a poisonous
insect bit her lily-white hand and disabled her for
some time. Mr. G. R. Ireland, of Bland Holt’a
company, was accidentally stabbed in the face by
Miss Ida Herbert while playing “ Alone in
London "at Newcastle, last Saturday. The Aus-
tralian theatT ical managers lost a great chance
during the Centennial week. Someone ought to
have revived “ The Ranger,” the first play ever
produced in Australia, which was written by a
convict and acted by a convict company nearly a
century ago. Kate Bishop knows so well the
exact effect which the footlights have on her face
that she can make up without a looking-glass.
Melbourne is choke-full of actors just now, and

A small boy at a Melbourne suburban
State school last week assaulted his teacher with

less his father keeps, a wood-yard.
Groom, Speaker of the Queensland As-
sembly, is a small man who wears a frock coat all
the year round, with a bit of shirt-front and a
black cross tie. He has a generally shiny look,
and at moments, as he walks up and down his
own Toowoomba, where he is a power political,
commercial, and social, his lips can be seen In mur-
murous movement. He is understood to be say-
Irg, “God bless you I” or perhaps he is only
repeating the prayer he “ opens proceedings " in
the House with.
The present Mayor of Sydney is son of
Dr. Harris, who formerly owned the whole of
Ultimo and built the old house in Harris-street,
now occupied by one of his sons. There Is a little
history attached to this property. The doctor, at
his death, bequeathed it jointly to both his sons,
John and George, but, unfortunately for himself,
through an oversight George was a witness to the
will, and, of course, by law could not inherit. He
does not lose by R, however, as his brother, the
Mayor, honorably shared the estate with him.
“ The Sydney Ministers’ Union” [Trades
Union.— -Ed. B ] “held their monthly meeting to-
day. The fearful extent to which Sabbath dese-
cration prevails in Sydney was brought under the
Union’s notice, and attention was drawn to the
fact that the evil was spreading in many ways,
and that the Day of Rest was fast slipping away."
Precis“ly so In Sydney, the tram-cars and omni-
buses and ferry-boats run on Sunday to carry
people to church, and shops keep open to sell
tram-tickets to alleged Christians on their way to
the sanctuary, and then sinners take advantage of
the facilities thus offered to the elect and dese-
crate the Sawbath by using these same trams to
go to see a shark-fight at a carnal aquarium. It
is sad—very sad.

According to the Sydney papers, Messrs.
Burke and Foley, pugilists, &0., are again going
to welt each other's frontispiece for £5OO or
£lOOO a-side. This time, it is understood, the two
men are both roused to a state of awful ferocity,
and each will smash up his enemy to the last gasp.
This sort of thing, of course, is good sport for the
quarrelsome public, but we respectfully submit
that it is very rough on two ladies whose
feelings ought to be respected. Only a few weeks
ago, Mr. Foley, who is a thing of beauty and a
joy for evermore, bestowed his classic figure upon
a very charming g’rl at the hymeneal altar, and
with all his worldly goods he did her endow.
Larry is a noble and well-respected youth, and
Mrs. F. is justly proud of him, and now she learns
that he is going to expose his speaking counten-
ance to be smote by a total stranger, and if the
stranger only smites hard enough the beauty
which won her heart will be gone for ever. She
did not marry a ramshackle object with a broken
nose and an eye driven out of the perpendicular,
and a mouth hauled round until it interfered
with his ears, but her good-looking husband Is
voluntarily going out to get himself converted
into such, and it is rough. Mr. Burke, too, is a
gentleman of noble coun-
tenance, and he has a
wife and family depen-
dent npon him. No doubt,
Mrs. Burke, as she well
may be, is proud of his
lordly aspect, and yet,
quite irrespective of her
feelings,, he intends to
expose that aspect to be
pounded by Mr. Foley'
and is voluntarily going
out to get his ear split by
that gentleman’s wind-
mill fists. Out of regard
for two amiable ladies,
who are deeply concerned
in the result, this sort
of thing should not tran-
spire. There could be no
possible objection to the
frenzied combatants en-
tering into an arrange-
ment to gas, and blow,
and snort for £5OO aside,
but we entreat them not
to hit each other. There
isn’t any reason why they
should. The public are’nt
used to it, anyhow, and
all they want is that
Mr. Foley and Mr.
Burke should put their
fathomless animosity into
the papers, and then take
the stakes. At present
Mr. Bennett, of the
Evening News, is hold-
ing the coin, but it doesn’t
signify anything to him
whether the men fight or
not. Possibly, however,
it was because Alfred
was acting as bottlehol-
der to this funeral that the local Herald and Tele-
graph kept aloof from hla recent Centenary
Press banquet. Perhaps they thought he was
sinking the dignity of the Press. Anyhow, we
trust these few remarks will be taken in good
part by all concerned. We appeal to Mr. Foley
and Mr. Burke to cork up their rage for the sake
of their wives and children and not to go out and
get thumped in a vital part. At the same time,
we trust that they won’t give vent to evil passions
and come down and tear round this office. We
don’t mean any harm in saying this ; we oan’o
fight ourselves worth a cent, and it Is unfair to
hit a man when he isn’t standing up.

The “ Guide.” recently published by the
Orient Steamship Company, is not distinctly an
attempt to straddle the higher walks of literature,
nor does the Company venture upon airy flights
of verse, but the book contains a few ideas that
are worth nothing, all the same. Here is ore
Within that Bnacioua haven, the most valuable gift of
nature to the Australian Continent, the British enaign was
hoisted in Sydney Oove, the spot which is now the centre of
the busiest life of the Continent, hereafter probahly to be the
object of associations as sacred to the future Australian nation
as the Plymouth Rock is to the descendants of the passengers
by the Mayflower.
There is 10,000 horse-power cheek in that one
little paragraph. Nothing smaller than an inflated
steamship company would have ventured to com-
pare the miserable convicts who were brought
ashore to live in chains in an earthly hell, and the
murderous gaolers who were 10 times worse than
they, with the Pilgrim Fathers cf whom Mrs.
Hemans wrote :
Amid the storm they sang,
And the stars heard, and the sea,
And the solemn aisles of the dim wood rang
To the anthems of the free.
There was too much snuffle and too many Scripture
quotations among that steeple-hatted crowd of
pilgrims, but still they never, even in their sad-
dest moments, dreamt that a steamship company
would one day arise and write a book in which
they were compared to the human refuse who
sold stolen rum and built a gallows on every hill
with the proceeds, The comparison is an insult
to the melancholy dead, and we ask the Orient
Company to act as becomes a white corporation
and take that paragraph back.

The blessed institution of the Centenary
has come to an end at last, and the bird of victory
has gone back to his perch. The show ended with
a great display of fireworks, and the men who
had been drunk for a week were all shaken up by
the fiery snakes in the air, and went home under
the impression that they had seen Satan tearing
through the atmosphere with rockets in his tail.
For our own part we kept strictly sober, but still
we hailed a hearse io William-street, Sydney, on
that firework night, and, thinking it was a ’bus.
requested the vehicle to drive us to our residence.
We have wondered a good deal since then as to the
significance of the omen. Next to the fireworks the
chief Centennial nuisance was the N.S.W, flag,
with its five-starred cross, which was flying every-
where. When the Deity fixed up the Southern
Cross He only put in four stars that can be seen by
the naked eye, but Parkes and Co. perceived the
mistake and fixed in their flag an extra luminary.
Some day, probably, when Providence has been
out late, it will note the omission and set the Con-
stellation right. If it hasn’t sense enough to do
this there will be no other resource than to alter
the flag. We trust, however, that this extreme
measure won’t become necessary, but, if it should
we move that three stars and a battle-axe in the
centre would be a good, reliable symbol which no
one could object to, and the Soudan motto.
“ Whisky and Blood," might be attached to ex-
plain the position. Or else we might have the
three stars with the old favourite war-cry of
“Advance Australia," and a crab attached to
show which way Australia was advancing. We
present these ideas finely to our bleeding country,
and ask for no reward except the gratitude of a
nation which is just recovering from the jim-jams.

CENTENNIAL THOUGHTS.
Young Thomson, a journalist, from the
back-blocks, has been patriotically celebrating the
Centenary of his country for two days and nights.
These are his thoughts on the third night: —
Whose head is this I hare on ?
It must be another fellow’s —my own is not half
as big.
I suppose they played this trick on me while I
was asleep. They might as well, while they
were about it, have put the head on the right way.
I shall never be able to look anyone In the face,
with the back of my head turned in front.
Hal Hal Happy thought !—
I’ll put my clothes on the same way and button
my coat at my back.
Hum 1 It will be infernally awkward at first.
How about my arms 2
I suppose I’ll have to get them disjointed and
turned round, too.
Beastly bora I
I wish I had never gone out with that crowd
the last two nights.
I wonder what that green cow in the corner
means by wearing a poke-bonnet and a red veil.
How the mischief did she get in here, anyhow 2
Must ask the Professor of Natural History
whether this is a common habit of cows or only an
eccentricity.
Ah ! So there you are—the Sea Serpent 1 Ac-
cept the assurance of my most distinguished con-
sideration. Yoop 1 Shoo 1 Take your eyes
off me.
Hah ! The Count Alvaro, bowing with old
Castilian grace to his opponent, lunged lightly and
George the Third was a corpse,
I wish I had a pencil.
I could write a novel in the best style of Dumas
now—
Why should a cat
Wear a white hat 2
Why should a cat,
For the matter of that 2
I’ll remember this, and write it all out in the
morning.
Lying In my little bed,
Thus unto myself I said,
Wish I had back my own head,
Not another man’s instead.
Next week I shall bring out a volume of poems at
ten guineas a copy. I would have done so before,
only I was afraid of hnrting the feelings of Brun-
ton Stephens and John Farrell—and Parkes. But
genius cannot.bs hidden all the time. After I
have done this, I shall go homeland buy out the
Czar. He ought to sell cheap.
1 What are those two devils in yellow
plug-hats doing at the bottom of the bed 2 You
needn’t glare at me like that, gentlemen.
You’ve called a good deal too soon. Drop in
about the next Centenary, and I may be able to
attend to you.
JH !Stop dragging at my feet, or I’ll kick your
head in.
John Jenkins was a fisher bold.
He fished upon the sea,
Ha caught ten snakes on the weather aide,
And nine upon the lee.
Must write that out, too, in the morning.
Reminds me of the Ballad of Sir Patrick Spans.
Could go on writing poetry like that all night.
Must be in splendid vein.
Wish I had back my own head, though. Don’t
properly understand the working of this one.
Think 111 go out and find the fellow that owns it
and get mine back.
If he refuses, I’ll punch it into a jelly for him.
Weep not for me when I am gone.

No Australian native spoke at the Sydney

Mr. George Higinbotham, the Victorian

London Punch, we notice, is getting ready

failure.
Vanity Fair, the impotent British Tory
“sassiety” rag, talks of Sir Patrick Jennings
coming “ from Victoria,” and calls the colonial
delegates “the representatives of England at the
antipodes.” Some fools tell the everlasting truth
by mistake at times.
The Victorian farmers urge Premier Gil-
lies to lower the freights, and Gillies says he can’t
because it would not pay. But why not tax the land
through which the railways go for the “ unearned
increment” value they have got in consequence,
and let the farmers’ freights pay only for carriage,
and not for the interest of the construction of the
railways ? That’s Henry George’s idea.
Cardinal Moran sent round his congratu-
latory Jubilee address from the Australian R.C.
Bishops to Queen Victoria. The Bishop of Sand-
hurst refused to sign it unless a clause were in-
serted praying her Pre-eminence in Grief to grant
Home Rule to Ireland. Moran could not get up
to that quite, so the address went home without
the signature of the old Irish churchman.
At the Bennett banquet Premier Parkes
observed :“I am a very curious kind of man. I
sometimes associate with newsboys, and I try to
get information from them.” Well, this is cer-

stood inside putting leading questions to an

Mr. Purves, the criminal bar ister, seeks
the presidentship of the Australian Natives As-

of hi i practical inexperience in regard to the

sary time to devote to its interests, and the un-
round judgment displayed in his public utter-

is not a political president, but a worker.

M‘llwraith is essentially a hasty politician,
and his administration “ never forgets its friends."
He utterly failed to understand the new attitude
of the old Tory paper, the Courier, which Fell-
berg, then its principal leader-writer, was aiming
to bring about—the attitude, namely, of “the
man on the fence.” He said of Feilberg that he
was “ the most dangerous man in the colonv,”
1 and would fain have dislodged him. Later on
they got to know more of each other, and Foil-
berg would demonstrate to him that the day of
the purely “spoils" administrations was past in
Australia, or that, at any rate, it was the duty of
the Press to make it so. M‘llwraith followed his
dead friend to the grave.
Some years ago an eccentric character named
Larry Bourke, put up for Kilmore (Vic ), intending,
if returned, to represent the constituency in the
Roman Catholic interest. One night, after Larry
had delivered an energetic address to a room full
of the free and enlightened constituents, the chair-
man. as usual, asked “if ar’ a gintleman had a
quishtion to ax Misther Bourke?” The great
majority of the congregation were Misther
Bourke's strong supporters - brawny, clump-
footed toilers and moilers from the fastnesses of
Tipperary, and when a bald-headed oppositionist
upended himself, and put a query which cast re-
flections upon the cause, the independent electors
arose with a wild howl, and, taking him bodily,
spun him out into the mud, where he lay a be-
draggled wreck. When the audience had com-
posed Itself the chairman reared once more, and,
with an expression of babyish innocence, asked :
“ Would any other gintleman like to put a quish-
tion to Misther Bourke ! ” No one liked. Politics
were run on pure Buffalo Bill principles in those
days, and many a burning question was settled
“ wld a bit ov a shtick.”
The S M. Herald blasphemously pokes
fun at the author of ' ‘ stolen momenta ” for a little
bit of rhyme worked off when the perpetrator
was a poor friendless lad. (He is now a poor,
friendless old man.) He is charged with the high
crime of attempting to make “ morning ” rhyme
with “dawning," but that is nothing in a great
poet. “Orion” Horne once wrote a “threnody ”
on the death of G. V. Brooke for the Melbourne
Yoriok Club, and therein made “ law ” rhyme
with “ war.” But then Horne was not a genius,
he was only eccentric.

When the pallid moon was beaming,
And the diamond dew' drops on the grass
All around our feet were gleaming,
Then I met my pretty, blue-eyed lass.
Locks of richest golden yellow
Clustered on her neck so warm and white,
And my darling kissed her fellow
While the stars above were shining bright.

Oh! golden sil-ver
(Revolve on another toe.)
Diamonds twinkling in the dewy grass ;
( Walk round.)
Can I e’er forget that evening—
Warmest, whitest, winsome, witching lass?
( Breakdown.)
Now the purple shades are falling,
And the birds are singing on the trees ;
I can hear my loved one calling
’Mid the balmy whispers of the breeze ;
Merrily I go to meet her,
Fold her form so fondly to my breast;
Nothing in the world seems sweeter —
Crimson sun declining in the west.

Oh! golden sil ver
(Revolve on other toe.)
Little fairy footsteps on the grass.

Can I e’er forget that evening,
Ling'rlng in the mazy mountain pass?

Love can never more grow older.
Golden jellow looks turn never gray ;
When within my arms I fold her
On that ne'er-to-be-forgotten day ;
Strolling through the fragrant heather,
Moonbeams casting haloes round her head.
Throbbing fingers twined together—
Waiting for the hour when we may wed.
(Revolve as before.)
Oh! golden sil-ver
(Other toe.)
Crimson-purple shadows on the green—
(Walk round.)
Can I e’er forget that evening,
Rosy, romping, royal little queen.

David Gaunson will be interested to hear tha
Mr. Justice Windeyer has been welcomed home
to Sydney by an assemblage of choice spirits,
which, while it, of course, included Sir Alfred
Stephen and the Sheriff, also comprised nearly
all that large company of grovellers who are ever
ready to welcome and bow down to anything that
happens to be in authority. The chairman, Sir
Alfred aforesaid, proposed the toast of the guest
of the evening, ‘•in warmly laudatory terms,
doing justice to his ability as a criminal
lawyer." Nevertheless, the independent sec-
tion of the community has long ago
arrived at the conclusion that Mr. Justice
Windeyer is utterly unfitted by temperament to
sit on the criminal Bench of any country, how-
ever admirably he may be adapted from a Vande-
monian standpoint for administering a Stephen -
made criminal code which boasts of 22 offences
punishable by death, and 30 or 10 visitable with flog-
ging. Amongst the guests of the evening was the
editor of the S.M. Herald, which cowardly
paper, on 7th January last year, said, in reference
to the Mount Rennie trial, presided over
by Mr. Justice Windeyer, that “reasonable
facilities had not been afforded for de-
fence by the prisoners’’—nine lads, four
of whom were subsequently hanged, and
that “ no case had been heard of in modern times
in which English judges had compelled jurors and
counsel in criminal cases, involving issues of life
and death, to sit all through the night, in spite of
repeated protests and requests for adjournment.”
This having been the opinion of the Herald, it
is an instructive and remarkable circumstance’ to
find its editor turning up to congratulate Judge
Windeyer on the beauty of his character as a
criminal lawyer. The plain fact of the matter is
that Judge Windeyer’s appointment was a
political iniquity, and his retention, after what
happened at the Mount Rennie trial, is a slur
on British justice in Australia.
Richard Seddon, the burly member for
Kumara, N.Z., and a prospective minister when
Vogel’s party again get the upper hand, did not
learn to read until he was 30, Despite a constant
contempt for the letter “h” he is a powerful-
even an eloquent speaker. One of his favourite
expressions is “ the ’igh ped destal of fame.” One
night a weary scribe in the press gallery at Wel-
lington penned the following anent Dick

Mr. Henry Stuart Russell, in his most
interesting book, “ The Genesis of Queensland ”
(recently published in Sydney by Turner and
Henderson), writes thus about an extempore our#
of pain practised by Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt dur-
ing his Australian exploration :
One night the smell of roasting wokfr me: were they
(Leichhardt’s party) so hungry that they couldn’t wait for
breakfast? Where and what can they be cooking? Un-
screwing myself out of my blanket, I followed my nose
which led me to Leichhardt’s small separate room To my
wonder and horror there he was, lying on his back with his
shoulder on the edge of the bed, frizzling over the flame of
a fat-lamp placed under it, i e. , the shoulder, His rheumatic
torture must have been, indeed, intolerable to find relief in
such a cautery. Yet Leichhardt declared it was the first
alleviation of his distress that he had been able to devise
The prescription was an opiate for him, the sight of it robbed
me of further sleep.
There’s a Sydney reporter who has spent
hia half-century life among the dead. He was
the favourite nephew of his uncle, the city
coroner of Dublin 30 years ago, and in childhood’s
happy hour he used to go with his learned rela-
tive to morgues and dead-houses and play with
scalps and pericardiums and things, and cry when
he couldn’t have a mucous membrane for him-
self and a biliary duct to bring home to his little
brother. As years rolled on, he became a news-
paper reporter, and for 30 years or so he has
haunted Coroner Youl, of Melbourne, or Coroner
Shiell. of Sydney, like a happy dream. If you
find this man at any time sad, or sorrowful, or re-
ticent, talk to him cheerfully of the morgue and
the post-mortem, the dark flowing river and the
genial poison, the glittering razor and the rusty
dinner-knife, the convenient rope and the cheer-
ing voice of the blunderbuss, and you draw him
out till he melts in eloquence and pathos.

"When the other evening a British blue-
j acket was deputed by his comrades to publicly
present a bouquet to Lady Carington at the
Sailors’ Festival in Sydney, he contented himself
with shaking the hand so cordially held out to
him by her Ladyship. When, however, it came
to the turn of a Russian sailor to present a
bouquet on behalf of bis shipmates, the Czar’s
minion, not content with merely shaking hands,
gallantly kissed the lady’s glove—which quite
brought down the house, and was so unexpected
a demonstration as to make Lady Caringtcn blush
furiously. At supper time, however, some of the
Russians were so nervous at the presence of the
ladies that they actually lost their appetites at
the table. The British tar, on the contrary, did
not lose his little appetite, and ho straightway
proceeded to improve the shining honr by making
fast and furious love to his hostesses. He had no
hesitation whatever in demanding of matronly
ladies, per medium of conversation lozenges,
Whether they were “engaged”; and when, in
feply to a direct qiiery of similar character orally
addressed to a very pretty girl who has bnly
lately been married, she held up her ringed finger,
Jack laid bis hand on his heart, turned up
his eyes and gave a most affecting and genuine
sigh of disappointment. One young lady, (he
daughter of a well-known professional man, got
nine distinct and pressing offers from Diamond
blue-jackets to “ see her home.” “I am so glad
they only gave the sailors ginger-beer,” she re-
marked ; “if they had had a little ale, 1 am quite
sure they would have pinched me.”

"Very strained relations exist just now,
We are told, between Admiral Fairfax find Sir

minated the other day, when an application was
made by the Admiral that the electric light ap-
pliances used at the great Centennial banquet
should be left standing for the Sailors’ Festival.
The request was flatly refused, so the Admiral
vows that he will go to New Zealand waters and
visit Sydney as rarely as possible. Which episode
forms an admirable procf of the expediency of the
colonies subsidising an Imperial fleet. Mr. Fair-
fax and Mr. Parkes have a personal row, where-

Canon Dalton, who visited Australia as
tutor to the Prince of Wales’ sons, is the fortunate
proprietor of 200 acres ot land on One-tree Hill,
at the head of Fern-tree Gully, about 25 miles east
of Melbourne. The Princes’ bear leader was so
enraptured by the lovely panoramic view to be
seen from tfce emineccs named that he deter-
mined, at all hazards, to obtain a grant of a por-
tion df the hill, the whole ot which was supposed
to be strictly reserv ed by the Grown for public
purposes. Chiefly through the influence of
royalty and Loch and Co., the Canon is new the
possessor of 200 acres of this lovely spot. Which
is, without doubt, one of the greatest political
jobs ever perpetrated in any country.

Among the guests at Lady Carington’s re-
ception the other day was a lady from the back
regions of New South Wales, where they only
raise a fraction of a shock headed boy to the
sqnare mile and don’t pnt on the hereditary frills
common to the effete dwellers In large cities, and,
being a stranger, she was naturally taken in. She
shook hands with Lady Cariogton in an impres-
sive fashion, and said she 'oped she was keeping
'earty, also the old man and the kids, and then
she seemed to feel that an eye was upon her, and
she turned round—to meet the gaze of the
Governor’s gorgeous Tnmmas in livery. There
was a look of reproach in Tummas’s eye, and be-
lieving that she had hurt the feelings of the
veneered menial she said humbly, “Oh ! I beg
your pardon,” and shook hands cordially with him
also. Then her eye fell on the flunkey’s calves
and she staggered. The aspect of these porten-
tous limbs convinced her that she had been taking
liberties with a Russian Grand Duke, and feebly
saying that she was very sorry she drifted aim-
lessly away and was lost to view. Even Tnmmas
smiled a fleeting smile, and then his wooden
visage closed up and ho looked thoughtfully at
his legs. # m
At last! E. J. Smith, Mayor of Adelaide,
has been knighted. Which reminds us that
another Smith, Robert Burdett, of that ilk, of
Sydney, who has long struggled for a knight-
hood, has now one more chance offered him
of securing the coveted bauble. Parkes has ap-
pointed him to represent N.S.W. at Melbourne
Exhibition. Years ago, yet another of the Smith
family—be who was seven times Mayor of Mel-
b urno —went ‘ 1 home ” with an address of wel-
come to Queen Victoria on the marriage of the
Prince of Wales. This colonial Dick Whittington
expected at least a baronetcy He took unto him
a private secretary and a chaplain—Rev Perks,
of Richmond—but came back plain John Thomas,
and was accompanied by a donkey. Imagine St.
John’s Tavern Smith going home with a chaplain!
His portrait was published in the Illustrated
London News, frilled shirt and all, and he might
have been knighted but for a little incident at
Birmingham, over which we draw the horse-cloth

An aristocratic emblem of England’s great-
ness, or, as the Peat’s Ferry folks called him, a
“real, live lord,” with his lady and suite, paid
the Hawkesbury River a hurried visit on their
way to Gosford. After a precarious voyage at
low tide, the pilot managed to reach there safely,
having only scraped bottoih once. My lord was
pleased at the cleverness of the pilot, and
Showed his approbation in a handsome manner :
he gave the pilot (who had the extreme honour of
handing her ladyship, with about five hundred-
weight of luggage, off, the steamer), a whole
shilling for himself and another shilling to be
divided between the engineer and his assista” t.
His lordship felt much disgusted on hearing the
pilot (who evidently thought at first that his was
a sovereign at least) most emphatically exclaim,
“ Only a ——- shilling 1” The bloated aristocrat
and his crowd sped on by train at Government ex-
pense, and the pilot drank confusion to him with
the “bob."

Lady Parkes, wife of Sir Henry Parkes,
died on Thursday, February 2, at Balmain,
Sydney, aged nearly 75. For several years she
has been almost unknown to the world, and her
death now recalls her to the memory cf many who
had almost forgotten her existence. She was a
native of Birmingham (Eng.), where she was mar-
ried in 1836, and two years later came to Aus-
tralia with her husband. Despite the many years
which she spent in N.S.W., Lady Parkes was
little known to the public, though she was de-
servedly loved and esteemed by her circle of per-
sonal friends, and so retiring was she that she was
only once persuaded, during her husband's long
political career, to appear at the opening of Par-
liament. She died from that disease which medi-
cal "science describes as natural decay, and her re-
mains were interred on Saturday in the secluded

“ventilate”—l believe that is the proper term—
the following grievance relative to the employ-
ment of women. Having tried various “genteel”
ways of earning an honest living, from governess-
ing in the back-blocks to canvassing for a bogus
land sale in Melbourne, I hailed with delight the
following advertisement which appeared in the
columns of the Sydney Morning Herald, and to
which I sent the subjoined reply
WANTED, a Superior Working Housekeeper, must be
industrious, educated, musical, trustworthy, good
cook, good needlewoman, wages £4O. Address testi-
monials to “ Qdid Pro Quo, G P.O.' 1
“ gir,—ln answer to the above I would like to say
that I possess some of the desired qualifications.
For instance, I am equally at home in the kitchen
and the drawing-room, being able to do anything
from splitting wood for the stove to painting
water-lilies and dreams in blue'and-gold for the
parlor brackets. 1 am industrious, always liking
to work till 11 o’clock at night, and not caring to
rise later than five in the morning. I am fairly
educated, having entered Melbourne University
* with credit ’ and come out ‘ with honors ’ I
am musical; thus, after washing up the dinner-
plates and putting a superfine polish on the sauce-
pan lids I could entertain you with the master-
pieces of Mendelssohn, Mozart, Beethoven, Bach,
or Sarti; should you feel sad, the gay airs of
Verdi, or a delicious waltz by Strauss mightmake
you grateful that such men had lived. At other
times Wagner might exasperate you, or Sullivan
remind you that ‘To polish up the handle of the
big front door ’ was one of my daily duties. If
you sing I could accompany you ; or if you would
be sung to I could —after having laid the kitchen
fire, and got your boots ready for the morning-
warble to you in French or Italian. I am trustworthy:
you could give me untold gold, and find it quite
correct when you cams to count it over. I can
cook —Soyer and Brillat Savarln were mere
culinary quacks ; besides, I am a philosopher, and
a man’s face is but as an open page in a cookery-
book. Like Shakespeare’s heroine, lam ‘ delicate
with my needle,’ and can sew anything, from car-
pets to fine lace. As it is not mentioned, I sup-
pose the washing is ‘ put out,’ which latter is a
pity, as that branch of domestic economy is my
special pride and joy. Wages no object; age, 24;
complexion neither fair nor dark ; figure tall and
slender; family good—blood of the bluest blue,
but
Necessitas non habet legem."
Would you believe it, dear Bulletin—out of 40
applicants, I was rejected, solely on the ground
that “ I knew too much ” ? This set me thinking,
and the result was that I began at ones to drop
my h’s, and any other educated nonsense that I
had about me; put two yards extra steel in my
“improver," let down my back-hair in a pig-tail,
donned a poke hat, and marched forth, resolved
to conquer or to die. I enlisted as a “ general," the
field of battle was a registry office, the skirmish
was short, sharp and decisive. In half-an-hour I
was dictating the terms of peace—sixteen shillings
a week, no washing, every night out, and a holi-
day whenever I liked. Verbum sap. P.S.—At
prisint Oi’m doin’ a mash wid the mas liter, whoile
missus is toastin’ her face In the kitchen, cookin’
the dinner.—Yours truly, Biddy-which-is-
Maud.

An individual who hasn’t relf-respect
enough to walk before a lord, and would prefer to
wriggle Into his presence on his stomach, sug-
gests, per the sympathetic S. M. Herald, that
the exact spot where Carington stood when per
forming the ceremony of opening the N.S.W. Cen-
tennial Park, should be marked by “an obelisk”
bearing Bob’s name and address, and any airy
trifle of like breathless interest, on a brass plate.
Also the data when he did it, and a photograph
would be inserted to show just how he looked as
he did it, and a weather map, too, ought to be
here, to show our great-grandchildren what sort
of a day it was while he was doing it. There’s
lots of scope in an obelisk ; and if there was more
room left the genius who suggested the thing
might preserve one of his ears in oil, and nail
that up too—but we don’t suppose there’d be
space for it.

No wonder Bcmnor, the “Australian
Giant,” continues to stay in England. Here is a
slab of the marmalade served out to him in a
recent issue of—hold your breath—the Family
Herald: —
Mr. Bormor, the Australian cricketer, stands 6ft. 6in. in
height; but you surely do not think that his immense height
makes him ungainly ? He is quick as a kitten, strong as a
horse, and so handsome and graceful that he is finer than
any Greek statue that we have seen. Our opinion is shared
hy Mr. Ruskin, who was taken to see the Victorian giant.
Bonnor was constantly at exercise when he was young, and
his magnificent thaws make his height seem unexaggerated.
Again, take Mr. W. G. Grace. He stands about 6ft. 2in.,
but his chest is about 47in , and his limbs are gigantic.
While he was growing he was always at cricket, and the con-
sequence is that at 40 years of age he is one of the biggest,
nimblest, and most splendid athletes in Great Britain.

The Auckland Club—immortalised by
“ Ocaana ” Froude—gave a recherche spread to the
officers of the Fleet during their late trip to the
North Island of N Z, Which reminds us that one of
the greatest of modern sights is to see a senior officer
enter a club accompanied by three or four mid-
shipmen each aged 13 or 14 years. “Will you
have a drink 1 ” says the senior officer. “ Yaas,"
chorus the midshipmen. “ Smoke ? ” says the
senior officer. “Yaas,” chorus the midshipmen,
who immediately proceed to pull out nine-inch
cigars and place themselves outside brandies and
sodas inches taller than themselves. It is
rumoured that the other night in Auckland a
midshipman fell into a glass of whisky-squash
and would have been drowned in It but for the in-
tervention of a gallant .navigating lieutenant. As
it was he bad a very narrow escape and sank
twice ere he was pulled out.

There was a full-flavoured joke perpetrated
at a church bazaar not long since. Two young

kisses at the rate of sixpence each, or go-as-you-

starting business, they partook of the cold colla-
tion purveyed by the local psalmist—cold ham
and pickles. When the first log-roller came up
to the scratch he quickly collapsed and begged to
be excused. Reckoned he didn’t come down here
to weed no onion-beds, anyway. The simple-
minded settler searching for grace Ilketh not the
aroma of the pickled onion. Let us pray,

How the plunging Marquis of Hastings
sneaked the promised bride of Mr. Henry Chaplin
is an oft-told tale. How Chaplin revenged him-
self upon his rival and the faithless fair-ha! ha !
—by winning the Derby with Hermit (a horse
which the Marquis was induced to lay against to
the tune of £100,000) is also a matter of history.
But, if rumour doesn’t lie, the patient Chaplin is

THE ONE THING NEEDFUL.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
She was gentle and very good-humoured,
Her beauty no language can tell,
And she had (it was commonly rumoured)
A nice bit of money as well;
She danced like a sylph, or a fairy,
So gracefully glided and sprang—
But the fly in the ointment with Mary
Was a horrid Colonial Twang.
Her teeth were of ivory whiteness,
Her hair in sweet wantonness curled—
She seemed like a vision of brightness
Come down to illumine the world.
But the spell in an instant was broken,
My poetic bubble went bang,
When her first words of welcome were spoken
With a horrid Colonial Twang,
She chatted with sweat animation,
Her grammar was quite without flaw ;
But, while she kept up conversation,
Dear Mary kept dropping her jaw ;
She played very well the piano,
Then (after some pressing) she sang,
And billed a most tender soprano
With a horrid Colonial Twang,
What odds, though her gold tresses glistened—
What mattered how clever her quips
To me, as I shuddered and listened ?
Oh ! why did she open her lips ?
I sighed as I left her for ever,
And felt at my bosom a pang—
But I never could love her, no, never.
With that horrid Colonial Twang.
Though the words of a woman bo witty.
Though her song have an angelic ring-
O ! in talking, or warbling a ditty,
The accent is really the thing ;
For the fairest of Mother Eve’s daughters
I care not a button—a hang,
If Her Gracious's English she slaughters
With a horrid Colonial Twang.

Four loafers were sitting in a store—four slow,
meditative loafers, all waiting till the storekeeper
should get so tired that he would give them some-
thing to eat in the hope that they might go away.
The storekeeper sat on the counter with his legs
hanging down, and thoughtfully sized them up.
They looked as if they had taken root, and after
two hours of waiting he acknowledged, with a
sinking in his heart, that there was nothing for
It but to let them feed. So he carelessly prised
open a barrel of dried apples, and then he sat as
before with his legs hanging down, and watched
the deadbeats wade in. They gob half-way
through the barrel, and then four loafers began to
clamour for something to drink. The emotionless
shopman brought in a dipper of Water, and
scratched his unshorn chin pensively and gafced
with lack-lustre eyes at the unseen while they
swallowed a pint apiece on top of those dried
apples, which Immediately swelled up to such an
extent that they obscured the premises. Then
ensued a scene of agony. Bach unemployed
complained that he was several shies larger than
his skin, and wanted to get out and look at himself

and presently the four were wallowing on the
floor crying and using smothered expressions
culled from the slums of their mother tongue,
and asking for something—St. Jacob’s Oil, ink,
patent hog-specific, hair-restorer, gum, anything
at all, and be dashed quick about it—to relieve
their misery. Meanwhile the storekeeper sab
peacefully on the counter with his legs resting on
nothing, and his far-away eyes roaming over the
boundless fields of Time, apparently oblivious of
the racket around him. At last, however, he got
down slowly and reached for the castor-oil —but
the subject is not worth pursuing any further.
He simply reached for the castor-oil, and the story

Mr, Speight, Chief Commissioner of Vic-

(who wax fat upon the manufacture of rolling-

Speight objects to this on the ground that too
much banquet is apt to interfere with the active
discharge of duty, so “public” devotion towards
the locomotive gentleman must be restricted to
an Illuminated grovel and a purse of money. A

A CONVERSATION OVERHEARD IN
PITT-STREET.
No, thanks! I’Uever go in for gold or silver
mines. At the best, if all’s square, they are but
lotteries. I like something solid and sure. The
shares of the Australasian Trust Management
Company are my only fancy. Nothing like them
for safe and increasing dividends. I took 1000 of
their first issue early last year. Can’t get any
more of them, so I’m going in for 200 of their £5
Guaranteed Preference Shares.
Guaranteed shares 2 Wha > are they 2
Why, you pay one-fouith (£1 S' - .) per share in
cash, or by instalments of Is. per share per month,
and if you have houses, or land, or shares, or
deposit receipts or cash, you can deposit your
deeds, shares, deposit receipts or cash as
a guarantee for the balance of £3 15s. per
share, and you continue to occupy your house, or
to draw your rents or dividends, or interest pay-
able as usual on your deposited securities ; or if
you guarantee by deposit of cash you dray? in-
terest thereon at Current Bank Rates, receiving
also, in any case, a bonus of £8 per cent; per
annum on the amount so guaranteed, together
with a share Of profits on ard from payment lip
of the £1 as. per share; And you may change of
withdraw your security at pleasure.
Why, hov can they afford to give a bonus of £2
per cent, on money they cannot employ 2
Well, you see, as they need a big capital to
secure a special Act of Parliament and the con-
fidence of trustees, it’s easier to get out a large
capital in this way, for there are thousands who,
having houses, land, or other securities, are glad
to make a second profit on them ; and it’s cheaper
to give a bonus of £2 per cent, than to pay a high
rate of dividend on a large paid-up capital, so
shareholders and company are both benefited 5
and while the public have the guarantee of an un-
doubted capital, the company, being able to afford
such a solid security, attracts a good business, and
makes a good return on the part paid up.
It seems all right; but I never heard of such
shares before ! .
Oh! guaranteed shares are common in Holland
and the Cape, and you know the old But ch finan-
ciers are safe, long-headed fellows and I don t
suppose anyone would object to follow their
good example, and make a second profit on their
securities when they have the chance.
Well, no, if it’s safe.
Safe! Why “trust management” business is
at once the safest and most profitable of businesses
—nothing like it for safety, and nothing has ever
equalled it for large and constantly increasing
dividends.
That’s a strong assertion.
Well it’s true—nothing more true. You see,
being only an agency business a trust company
has no risk ; and its bu iness once well started
increases as testators die off to an extent which
must y eld an amount of business on which to
draw commissions very many, many times in ex-
cess of its capital; The profl sof every business
depend on doiag the largest amount of business
on the smallest possible capital, and Trust Manage*
ment business gives this chance in the highest de-
gree.
What will they pay 2 You seem to have studied
the matter.
Well, you know I’m cautious. I never go in for
anything with my eyes shut, bnt why I know so
much about the matter ie—you remember meeting
Moller at my bouse about three years since, when
he was on a visit to the Cape—well, he expressed
surprise that we had no Trust Management Com-
pany here ; couldn’t do without them at the Cape
he said. He told me of several friends who, or
whose widows, are now drawing enormous divi-
dends which bad increased in 30 years from £8 to
£3OO per cent., and more in one case.
That seems too good to be true.
Well, it is true ; but it has taken time, of course
—it’s the growth of business over many years. He
told me no Trust Company has ever gone wrong,
they can’t go wrong, they all make steady progress.
What has been done at the Cape and in Melbourne
can surely be done here; Why not 2
One would think so I didn’t know they hat!
any such compat ies in Melbourne.
Oh, yes, and all doing weil ; one already pays
I £2O per cent.
What do you expect to make 2
I calculate on a certain £8 per cent, perhaps
£lO, as soon as the company gets its capital, and
I am sure I am within the mark in looking for an
increase of at least £2 per cent, per annum; so
that my wife, when I’m under the turf, will get
say 30 per cent, on my £lOOO, or £3OO a year.

hundreds to inve .t.
Ihen £1 “Preference” shares, the third issue

scribe for a few of them, and you will certainly
make money. You have no need to guarantee
them. They may be paid up in fall, or to ss.

of one shilling. They bear a preference dividend
of £6 per cent, per annum from payment of ss.

for yourself and the wife and 100 apiece for the

ROW’S
Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken two
or three times a day i a wlneglasafnl for an adult,
smaller quantity for children.
For general Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of Dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, Is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known,
Persons suffering from Skin Disease will find
these Bitters Invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals, diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day,
THEY PURIFY THE BLOOD AND LIVER.
SEE WHAT A MEDICAL GENTLEMAN SAYS
ABOUT THEM.
Messrs. B. Rowe and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried.
Yours faithfully,
HENRY CHARLES CURTIS,
M.R.C.S. England,
Fort Adelaide, October 30 ISS6,
Gentlemen,—l have great pleasure in recom-
mending Row’s D anelion Bitters, I have been
suffering for several ye-ws with Liver complaint,
and been under several doctors for it without any
curative result. I have only taken two bottles of
your Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a different
man. I can, therefore, with truthfulness, advise
all who suffer from Liver complaint to try them,—
Yours,
0. R. UPJOHN, J.P,
Tamworth, August 31. 1886.
Read an expression of thankfulness received by
the undersigned i—
“ I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, Indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feelings of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced an
unexpected and wonderful effect and change In
my system, and has removed from my mind the
horribly depressed feeling and former condition of
bodily ailment I have so unhappily experienced
for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afflicted as I have
been may take advantage of them,

all going to be damned or saved together woult
rob existence of its one gre »t charm,
Long before Dr. Boss, M.P. for Molong
N.S. W, ; giiccess’uliy contested his electorate-
then included in the Wellington division—he hat
dr his oppot eat James Wakt field, an Identity c:l
the West, sis Ce deceased. Wakefield was
Sqndttcr with all the cun ing of a bu h lawyer
and on maty occasions proved too much far th.
Doctor. Hearing that the 1 ater would address
the electors in a b ck pareour of ge ial Jack
Wynne’s pufiic-hou e on the Molong River, he
daiernained to outdo him cnee more. Wakeflelt
had In his employ a loquacious shepherd with
thorough knowledge of the cur.ent politics oi 1 ,
that time. D.rguisirg this man in a sundowner's
gatb, the proverbial “ bluoy,” find a bidy-can, he
sent him off ti the meetirg. The politician’s elo-
quence flowed uninterrupted by disorder for half-
an-hour, when the stranger began to catechise the
speaker, some of the questions telng staggerers.
The electors up to this period sat listlessly, gap-
ing about the room; now, however, they began
to grin hideously, maddening the fiery Celtic
temper of the Doctcr, who had to suffer the
double indignity of being f allied by a tramp and
iaughed at by boundary riders, grooms, and shep-
herds. For 10 minutes he put up with the tumult,
then, overcome by his unsympathetic surroundings,
he grabbed up his papers and fled f.om the room.
The shepherd, bluey, and billycan succeeded the
candidate and his papers For two hours spoke
the follower cf Wakefield, and gained such
applause that Dr. Ross, for the time, abandoned
politics and fame, and wichdrew from the contest.
To this day, however, he did r ot know that he
was outwitted 1-y his rival, James aforesaid.

receipt of instructions for country buyers who can-
not attend the sale at the lowest rates.
THE land is the best ever yet submitted by
subdivision around Melbourne, and it is
admittedly the acme and perfection of the most
fashionable, the healthiest, the most charming,
and the most romantic spot of 1 ooi ak, which, it
is needless to say, stands without a rival amongst
the suburbs of Melbourne. The Estate, which is
surrounded by Mansions, has a beautifully pano-
ramic view. For accessibility to the City the
Estate excels all other fashionable residential sites
By road it is about miles from the Post-office
by rail it is considerably less. The Glen Iris R-i
way branches off from Burnley,'and after travel
ling one mile and three-quarters reaches the Rail
way Station to be erected on Mr. Ferguson’s pro
perty at the Glenferrie-road. This Station is two
minutes’ walk from the GREAT TOORAK
ESTATE. By rail the City will be reached from
your breakfast-table comfortably in fifteen
minutes. The Toorak Tram, now in course of
construction, will take you from the heart of the
City to within eight minutes’ walk of the Estate
for Threepence, and the omnibuses from the Tram

PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT.
MOUNT GILEAD.
Situate upon the Great Southern Line of Railway
four miles from Campbelltown Railway Sta-
tion, and less than two miles from Menangle
Station, divided by the Nepean River (to
which it has nearly two miles frontage) from
the FAMOUS CAMDEN PARK ESTATE.
ABE A, 2063 ACRES
TITLE. TORRENS’ ACT.
MILLS and PILE have received instructions
from Edmund B. Woodhouse, Esq., in
consequence of his intended departure from the
colony, to submit to auction, at their rooms, 130
Pitt street, Sydney, on THURSDAY, 12th April,
at 11.30, the above
MAGNIFICENT FREEHOLD ESTATE.
MOUNT GILEAD is distant from Sydney only
two hours by rail and road, being only 30 minutes’
drive from Campbelltown Station by an excellent
metalled road. The property is unique in charac-
ter, and the auctioneers can unhesitatingly de-
scribe it as one of the most valuable and highly im-
proved properties ever submitted for sale in the
colonies. About 1600 ACRES have been cleared
of dead wood and unsightly trees, leaving only

ABOUT THAT SOAP.
“And she went into the garden to cut a cabbage
leaf to make an apple pie, and a great she-bear
coming up the street poked his head into the shop
window and said!— ‘What! No Cashmere Bou-
quet Soap! ’”
Many intelligent people who are very particular
tn the selection of only the purest food and the
best made fabrics, give very little thought to the
kind of toilet soap which they use, overlooking
the fact that impurities of soap are readily
absorbed into the pores of the skin, producing
roughness, chapping, and injurious results.
The sale of the CASHMERE BOUQUET Toilet
Soap for the past year exceeded the importations
of all toilet soaps from England, France, Ger-
many, Italy, and all other countries combined,
as shown by the ofhoial reports of the United
States Treasury for 1886.
COLGATE and CO.’s large Perfumery business,
situated where the firm first began business, in
New York, enables them to make the most deli-
cate perfume for their Toilet Soaps, and 30 first
awards from foreign and domestic exhibitions
testify to their superiority.
COLGATE and CO. are the oldest and largest
manufacturers of toilet soaps in the United States.
Soaps bearing their name are distinguished by
their attractive appearance, by their soft and
creamy lather, and by the richness and delicacy
of their perfume.
Sold by all Chemists and Dealers In Perfumery.

The office held by the kidneys is one of import-
ance. They act as nature's sluice-way to carry
off the extra liquids from the system and with
them the impurities both those that are taken
into the stomach and those that are formed in the
blood. Any clogging or inaction of these organs
is therefore important. Dr b six's bitters ara
nature’s efficient assistant in keeping the kidreya
in good working order, strengthening them, and
inducing healthy action. If you would get well

The Chtne.se in Victoria.— On many of the sheep-farms
and sugar plantations, Chinamen are employed to ass'st, and
the faith that the inhabitants of the Flowery Land have in
(he virtues of Freeman’s Genuine Chlorodyna may be in-
ferred from the fact that most of tee sheep-owners and
planters order one hundred and twenty dozen of Freemans
Chlorodyne at a time for the use of John Chinaman and the
other employes. A gentleman, in writing to Mr Freeman,
► ays— ‘I have much pleasure in tessifying to the excellent,
curative properties of ymir Ohlorodvne in many diseases
during many years’ residence in New Zealand I have given
-it repeatedly and always with gool effect, both on
Kuropeai s and Celestials, and have never found it fail to

WICKED FOR CLERGYMEN.
Rev. , Washington, D C , writes: I believe it to be
ell wrong and even-wicked for cUrgymsn or other public men
to be led into giving testimonials to quack doctors or rile
t tuffs called medicines, but when a really meritorious article
made of valuable remedies known to all, that all physicians
use ard trust in daily, we should freely commend it. I there-
fore cheerfully and heartily commend Dr. Soule's American
Hon Bitters for the good they have done me and my friends,
firmly believing they have no equal for family use. I will
not be without them.”—" New york Baptist Weekly.”
CURED OF DRINKING.
“ A young friend of mine w’s cured of an insatiable thirst
for liquor, which had so prostrated him that he was unable
i o do any business. He was entirely cured- by the use of
Dr. Soule’s American Hop Bitters It allayed all that burn-
ing thirst; took away the appetite for liquor: made his
nerves steady, and he has remained a sober and steady man
for more than two years, and has no desire to return to his
cups; I know of a number of others that have been cured of
drinking by it.”—Prom a leading R. R. Official, Chicago, 111.

IT AGAIN*
Plain reading, but freighted with material,
V7r-“- ' solid meating.
Our Buooesßora have depended largely upon bold
essay and extraordinary enterprise. No firm can
t oldly declare prices unites they feel thoroughly
(hat they mean business and are deer mined to
give bargains that make those who reap the ad-
vantages declare promptly and immediately:
That they are astonished 'lhat they are
pleased. That they are astounded. That they
are gratified,
And can we do it ? Ah ! Can we do it ? Can
aay one else so boldly declare that they can bene-
fit the public. That’s the important part of it.
Well, we can do it. We can benefit the public.
We can help them to benefit themselves. And
we recognise this important fact, that we cannot
hope to have the encouraged business that has
been our blessed share unless we solidly, clearly,
end unmistakably give evidence of our ability.
We have proved ourselves eminently superior to
a’l competitors ia the many special departments
upon which we have ventured. And we ask—
Who can sell Furniture with us ?
Who can sell Upholstery with us?
Who can sell Bedsteads with us ?
Who can sell Bedding with ns ?
Who can sell Ironmongery with us ?
Who can sell Glassware with us ?
Who can sell Chinaware with us ?
Who can sell Electroplated Ware with ns ?
Who can sell Earthenware with us ?
Who can sell Carpets with us ?
Who can seil Drapery with us ?
Who can sell Underclothing with us ?
Who can sell Corsets and Gloves with us
Who can sell Linens with us?
Who can sell Clothing with us ?
Who can sell Hats with us?
Who can sell Mercery with us ?
Who can sell Gents.’ Underclothing with us?
Who can sell Clothes with us ?
Who can sell Boots with us ?
Who can sell Shoes with ns ?
Who can sell Laces with us ?
Who can sell Boys’ Boots with us ?
Who can sell Boys’ Trousers and Vests with us?
Who can sell Youths’ Clothes with us ?
Who can give better value than we ?
And perhaps in this last line the kernel of the
commercial nut may be found centred.
WELD, HERE IS THE SECRET ! - Content with
small profits, knowing that we must sell cheap,
WE ARB BOUND TO DO OUR LEVEL BEST
TO KEEP ODR6 ELVES BEFORE THE
PUBLIC ; and keep before them we will, if the
very heavens should fall.
BEDSTEADS—
When in the public press it ia noticed that LAW-
LERS’ have a sale on, then let the Lord help all
essayists for the days of profits are numbered.
Holding 27,000 Beds f eads and Cots in |
stock, there is no firm in this or the old I
world can turn out so many hedsteads of |
a kind es we can.
Last Ootobar we were deluged with country
customers requesting onr bargain parce’s. Tne
town and suburbs were at it from neon till night.
The nine vans were as busy bees delivering north,
f outh, east and west. AND WHY ? Because we
offered bargains like the following IN BED-
S' TE ADS :We essayed and submitted immense
Four-post a-d Half tester Tabular Double Bed-
steads, together with wove wire mattress, together
with hair mattress, together with hair bolster,
together with two feather pillows, and we swore
we’d let the lot go astounding as the value is—
we swore we’d let the lot go at £6 12s. 6J., al-
though worth £lO 17s. 6d., the same lines.
Our immense assortment of bedsteads, the
numerous styles, the various s zes, preclude a
clear statement of lints, but the lot aforesaid
clearly proves our ability to show marvellous
va ue throughout the house. Remember, we do
not choose a claptrap line to endeavour to prove
t a'ue. We went straight away for one of our
bast lines and quoted it at our lowest price.
We would be wanting in our gem realty to
single men were we to omit to quote the follow*
lag extraordinary uue* :
Single Bedsteads, eitnor hJ'-’rs e rf rrpos’.
Palliasses for same.
Heavy Flock Mattress for same.
Flock Bolster and Kapok Pillow.
The lot for £2 7s. 61., well worth £2 12s.
This sale is meant to be another of our SPECIAL
THINGS, so that we must touch furniture And
in touching furniture we would quota special
lines : -
Chests of Drawers, for instance, 255., 355.,
47e. 6d.
Wardrobes, with glass doors, £5 15a. to £7 15s.
Couches in cretonne, 27s (id., 355.

Haircloth Couches, 475. (id., 65s , 75a.
Dinlng-tab’es, 14s. 61.. 20?., 255., 355.
Whilst in Carpets and Floorcloths wa say “ facile
priseeps” yet to back us out in our venturesome
statement we must qnote prices. To get Tapestry
Carpets at a low and reasonable price and to give
satisfaction at lj. 61. Is one of those things that
few are able to do. We do It. We do it. We do
it. And we can sell Carpets at la. 3d. to 4a. 6d.

BOOTS and SHOES. - Nobody likes boots to
wear out in a hurry. A ll are anxious that they
should stand a sole or two at any rate. Everyone

GOB GKBQIBGMai STREET
A COURAGEOUS BISHOP.
A CENTENNIAL OFFER.
A CONDITIONAL CHALLENGE.
Telegraphic agents never tell tarradiddles.
Should one be discovered doing such a thing, even
by accident, he would be promptly dismissed. This
makes them careful and their facts, as they
appear in the daily papers, are at all times to be
relied on, until they have been upset by later in-
formation. Therefore we attach considerable im-
portance to the publication of a statement said to
have been made by the Anglican Bishop of
Ballarat that he would undertake to walk down
Start-street in a costume of pea-green, if by so
doing he could benefit the golden city. The
reason for this courageous offer appears to be in
soma way connected with the supposition that
neither the seven Australian Governors, nor
Parkes, nor any of the principalities or powers
(including the press), had the decency to say,
“For what we are about to receive” at the
Sydney Centennial Banquet. Undoubtedly a lot
of people did say it; but there is always so much
noise made at these entertainments by the worthy
guests who get a good start on the oyster and
scrape him out of his shell with their knives, that
appearances were in favour of the supposition.
But it is still further accentuated and aggravated
by some wicked newspaper which has represented
the bishops of one denomination, with their
aprons and gaiters, in a back seat, whilst the
dignataries of another in gorgeous robes passed
in and took the cake. Any well-balanced bishop
would reseat this sort of thing, and if his Grace
of Ballarat does form himself into a pea green
procession in illustration of this peculiar phase
of Centennial sectarianism, and that brotherly
love which all Cnristians are supposed to have
for each other, then on certain conditions the
Waterbrny Watch Company will distribute the
wonderful Waterbary free throughout the function
to all participants and spectators. It is a good
bishop and the best of all watches. Just now it
sella freely all over the colonies at 13s. 6d., and
the demand outpaces the supply; but, for the
purpose of perpetuating the memory of the Cen-
tenary, this offer will be kept open for one calendar
month from date, and for ail business and canoni-
cal purposes during that time it may be referred
to as “ The Conditional Pea Green Centennial
Waterbary Watch Challenge of 1888.”

“ lb has become so common to begin an article,
in an elegant, Interesting style,
“ Then run lb into some advertisement that we
avoid all such,
“And simply call attention to the merits of Dr.
Soule's American Hop Bitters in as plain, honest
terms as possible,
“ To induce people
“ To give'them one trial , which so proves their
value that they will never use anything else.”
"Tse Remedy so favourably noticed in all the papers,
Religious and secular, Is
“ Having a large sale, and supplanting all other medicine.
*'There is no denying the virtues of the Hop plants, and
the proprietors of Dr. Saules’ American Hop Bitters have
shown great shrewdness and ability. * *
“ In compounding a medicine whose virtues are so palpable
to every one's observation.
Did She Die ?
“No !
“ She lingered and suffered along, pining away
all the time for years,”
t , “ The doctors doing her no good ; ”
‘ ‘ And at last was cured by this Dr. Soule’s
American Hop Bitters the papers say so much
about.”
“ Indeed ! Indeed ! ”
‘•How thankful we should be for that medi-
cine.”
A Daughter’s Misery.
“ Eleven years our daughter suffered on a bed
of misery,
“ From a complication of kidney, liver, rheu-
matic trouble, and Nervous debility,
* Under the care of the best physicians,
“ Who gave her disease various names,
“ But no relief,
“ And now she is restored to us in good health
by as simple a remedy as Dr. Soule a American
Hop Bitters, that we had shunned for years be
fore using it."— The Parents.
Father is Getting Well,
“ My daughter says :
“ How much better father is since he used Dr.
Soule’s American Hop Bitters."
“ He is getting well after his long suffering
from a disease declared incurable,"
“ And we are so glad that he used your
Bitters.”—A Lady of N.Y.

On Saturday next Kemp and Clifford meet
in a sculling match over the N.S.W. champion
course, but we are not going to hold ourselves or
Australia up to outside ridicule by adding that it
Is for the Championship of the World. Clifford,
as a sculler, the writer does not, and never did,
think much of, and if Kemp is up to anything
like alleged form he must win. There is little or no
excitement over the event, “ Our William” having,
if anything, injured his protege by dubbing him the
“ Champion of the World,” when it is so weU
known that the world is fairly bristling with

Saturday’s cricket at Sydney showed that
the Britishers did not over-estimate their ability
to successfully negotiate Turner on a good wicket,
that trundler failing to snare a wicket during the
whole day’s play; M’Shane took the whole of the
captured five wickets. Mac 's performance on
such turf was a good one, and in selecting a team
to go to England in March, the Melbourne left-
hander’s claim should not be lightly passed over.
Ulyett, for the first time for years past, showed
hi a true form, and it looked as if he was really
trying to get runs, an impression not always con-
veyed to the onlookers whilst he is at the wicket.

The greatest joke of the Burke-Foley
fight was not taken up by the dailies. During
several preliminary bouts between lesser lights of
the ring, the pugs, to a man, showed and shed
their blood in the boff, without remonstrance from
the police. When Foley and Burke appeared the
foorce discovered that the interests of mora’ity
required the men to wear guernseys I

The success of M‘Shane’s bowling on
Saturday was attributable to the fact that he did
not sacrifice pace for precision, but was content
to bowl medium pace. A like result was achieved
by M’Shane a few seasons back, also against an
English team, through adopting the same tactics.

Mr. A. T. Milson’s 40 tonner, the Era,
on Saturday last continued htr successful career
by securing a leg-in for Col. Gascoigne’s chal-
lenge cup. The Era is a “heeler” without a
doubt, atd Mr. “ Jack’ Want must “ whip the
eat” with a vengeance over his experimenting
with a big centreboard. We of Australia know
nothing of big centreboardera, and, as we re-
marked at the time she was laid down, a 10-
tonner is rather a large and expensive craft to
moke trials with.

The Sydney dead-head contingent are
likely to number considerably less at future big
cricket matches, both as regards “gate” and free
luncheon. Strange to say, this class of people all
seem to come from those who are best able to pay
for their luxuries.

Percy M‘Donnell, the brilliant bat, has
had much trouble of late. First he lost his
mother, after a few days’ illness. Then his second
eldest brother, who had been an ecclesiastical
student at Lyndhurst College, Sydney, died of
consumption. This was followed by the sudden
death of hla eldest sister, while the doctor was
writing a prescription for her. Then his father
(formerly Attorney-General of Victoria) was
stricken down by paralysis, and, finally, the other
day, his surviving brother was killed by a tram
accident in Melbourne !

The A. J. S. Bank has given Turner,
Ferris, and M‘Donnell twelve months’ leave to
enable them to go home to play with the combined
team. Ferris's arm being weak he will probably
not bowl again till he gets to England.

New chums must have rubbed their eyes
after reading that a Melbourne lumberer was sen-
tenced to six months for ticket-snatching at
Moonee Valley races. In England thousands of
“ brief a ” are anatched every year, bub the victim
who perchance collared the thief wouldn’t be able
to induce a policeman to take him in charge. Or
if he did contrive to put Mr. Snatober In the dock
the magistrate would coolly tell prosecutor that
he was engaged in an illegal transaction and the
law —the almighty Law— couldn’t assist him.
Under the “ home ” sys em, welshing and other
branches of racecourse thieving are positively
protected industries. An inner ring, where bets
are boot ed, is provided for the accommodation of
the nobility and gentry, and the vulgar public must
take care of themselves. But until we get Im-
perial Federation in sport the brief of the humble
Australian backer will remain a thing sacred to
himself —not at the mercy of the first greasy
scoundrel who can grab it.

Naturally enough —as it will appear to
those who have any knowledge of the surround-
ings of English professional pugilism—the so-
called fight between Smith and Kilraln was fol-
lowed by a foul murder. Mr. M'Nelll, who went
over to Boulogne to report this barney for the
London D.T., has been found drowned —his
pockets rifled, and his throat showing signs of the
garotte. Ere this appears in print, further par-
ticulars may be furnished respecting this beauti-
ful sequel to a beautiful exhibition, but, whether
or no, it is safe to assume that the ‘boys”—the
bullet-headed blackguards by whom prize-fighting
has been dragged down to the lowest depths of
iniquity—did poor M’Neill to death If he had
been on the staff ot a recognised sport-
ing paper, he would have taken care to
avoid the inevitable fate of any “ mug” who, with
a pound or two in his pocket, trusts himself alone
among the beetled-browed villains comprising 92
per cent, of the attendance at a merry mill. This
energetic special was probably seeking material
for “copy” among the “ talent,” when they quietly
choked him and flung his body into the water.
Of late the London papers have been endeavouring
to boom the noble art of self-defence. M‘Neill’s
murder ought to show said papers whab a miser-
able thing they have taken up, and how miser-
able is their chance of ever restoring it to the
position it held in the days of Tom Cribb. The
Bulletin has stated, more than once, that a
bare-knuckles fight in Australia is quite a
drawing-room entertainment as compared
with the bestiality of the pure British
article. The present w. iter once witnessed
what was termed a quiet little turn-up on
the banks of the Thames. A yoang lord
chartered a steamer to os try us to the rendezvous,
and provided a £5O cheque to be taken by the
victor. The fight took place at i in the morning,
under most select conditions for an affair of the
kind. And, by Heaven I when this scribe calls
to remembrance the faces that grinned round
the ropes, the little incidental fights that cropped
up as the onlookers’ blood got heated, and the
ugly scrimmage following the throwing up of the
sponge, he marvels that he lives to tell the tale.
The young lord wasn’t drowned, because he had
hired a body-guard of old bruisers to be paid when
they brought him safely back to town.

The so-called combined team had a bit of
bad luck as regards weather during their recent
match against Llllywhite’s lot, when the Britishers
won by five wickets and a run, but the writer
does not think the rain made any difference in the
result of the match, and that, all things being
equal aa regards weather, the Britishers ar6 far
and away the better team. A combined eleven
from the two British lots should prove a hard nut
to orack, but good as they look on paper it would
take them all their time to put under a genuine
co’onlal combination, consisting of, say, Turner,
Ferris, M‘Donnell, Moses, M'Shane, BJackham,
Jones, Bruce, Trumb’e Horan, and Garrett.
* * *
M‘Donnell has won the toss wbli Smith
three times in succession. He put the British era
in for the fl st match and put N.SW. in for the
last two. The odds are 7to 1 against pulling off
a triple event with the coin.

PARALYSIS AND INSANITY.
Human existence is no longer a measured
march, but a rapid race. It leaves little time for
rest and none for reflection. Our minds and
bodies are like so many engines, wi'hthe furnaces
always alight and the machinery always working
under high pressure. Now and then it breaks
down, and, as we hear of this or that person bei* g
carried off by appoplexy, or disabled by paralysis,
we pause for a mamant to utter some expression
ot compassion or sorrow, and then resume the
wild gallop in which he participated, and by
which he suffered. Our very recreations belle
the epithet They are pursued with such energy
that they become very hard work, Kven the
“ duties of society” per;ormsd by women, who?e
circumstances exempt them from the necessity of
making other exertions, are laborious in the
extreme, and the wear and tear ot fashionable
life Is responsible for a disease— neurosis— which
was unknown in former times. Wor<e than all,
insanity is rapidly on the increase, especially in
this colony, as shown by Mr Hayter’s Year Book,
from which we take the following figures : —ln
1861 there was one lunatic in every 819 persons ;
In 1871 there was one in every 392 persona; in 1881
there was one in every 304 persons. Now, sus
tained mental excitement and tension must be
reckoned among the predisposing causes of lunacy,
and the stages by which It is arrived at are thus
described by Dr. Koose :—Want of tone, sleepless-
ness, indigestion, and loss of appetite, derange-
ment of the heart, and hypochondriasis. Wnen
this has been reached, he observes, “the border
lands of insanity are within measurable distance,
even if they have not already been re»ohed." But
what are we to do? says one. We reply, live
more leisurely, and aid tired nature with Warner’s
cafe servic e. No one can ba well who does not
enjoy sound sleep Warnsr’s safe nervine ia not
a narcotic, it Is as harmless as water, and will, it
you are suffering from nervousness, headache,
et~., do you a vast amount of good. Mrs. A.
Toffo, of Stounton Hill, Townsville, (Q ), says
“ For the past four years during the hot season I
suffered greatly witn giddiness, violent throbbing
in the head, and down the sp;ne, causing great
weakness and irritation in the system. About
three months ago, when suffering severely, I took
Warner’s safe nervine, in teaspoonful doses every
two hours, in half a wineglassful of water, and
found immediate relief. I can safely say that it
is the most simple, and, at the same time, tbe
moso powerful remedy for soothing all nervous
aliments I know of" Mrs. Tofft’a experience is
but the experience of hundreds of others. If jou
are nervous and sleepless, and continually grow-
ing worse, unlees aided to health, you are on the
sure road to paralysis, or the mad-house. Calmly
think over tbis matter, and decide at once to
“ right about wheel," and pursue the road to re-
newed health and strength. *
