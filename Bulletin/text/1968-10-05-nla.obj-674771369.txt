One more week
COMING CLEAN
THE “Sydney Morning Herald”
last week presented as an item of
interest that the cleaner of the men’s
lavatories at the Sydney “Daily Tele-
graph” was Miss Anne O’Neill, daughter
of the Prime Minister of Northern Ire-
land. We cannot quite see why the
“Herald” thought this newsworthy; we
■had always understood that the
“Herald” cleaners were all PMs’
daughters, or better.
GETTING A MOVE ON
PEOPLE who believe that Melbourne
is a one-horse town should be pleased
to know that things are improving.
Consolidated Foods, the firm which
has Melbourne’s milk distribution by
the short hairs, so to speak, with
annual sales of $24 million, has
announced a plan to breed milk-cart
horses. Mr. Warwick Cayley, the chair-
man, said in the firm’s annual report
that they would establish a stud farm
at Laverton to make them self-support-
ing in horses.
This has been done not without some
financial thought. Mr. Cayley says it
costs $7OO to put a horse on the road
compared with $4OOO for a truck.
Furthermore, the average horse gives
10 to 15 years of plodding service and,
unlike a truck, keeps going while the
milko delivers bottles.
PICKING WINNERS
NOT DAUNTED by the rather shat-
tering experiences of Melbourne when
Princess Soraya and Jean Shrimpton
were brought there to enliven the Mel-
bourne Cup, Sydney this year is plan-
ning to put more glamor into the
spring meeting although, initially, at
least, there are no plans for anything
as spectacular as foreign royalty and
the glimpse of an elegant knee-cap
would hardly create much interest these
days.
Three months ago, the Australian
Jockey Club hired its first public-
relations officer, Frank Bird of Infoplan,
whose job it is to “personalise racing.”
According to a survey the AJC com-
missioned a short time ago, people
haven’t exactly forgotten what horses
look like, but they could do with a
few reminders of the attractions of
watching them race. So Frank Bird is
embarking on what he calls “a long-
term PR process to increase attend-
ances,” beginning with the Spring
Carnival this week at Randwick.
The stake money has been increased,
so that it totals $231,400 for the four
days of the meeting, children’s merry-
go-rounds have been set up in the
grounds, and Miss World will head a
contingent of beauty-contest winners
putting in an appearance on the day
of the Waratah Handicap.
Randwick’s 96 gardeners have been
working diligently to present a fitting
display of floral splendor, and trum-
peter Bill Burton has been commis-
sioned to compose “a call to the post,”
which is being trebled on a tape-
recorder and played for five minutes
before each race.
The grounds will be marred slightly
by construction work on the new $4
million five-storey grandstand, but race-
goers probably won’t mind that, since
the grandstand, scheduled for comple-
tion next Easter, will contain the ulti-
mate in facilities for a comfortable day
at the races.
But Mr. Bird is taking no chances. He
has in mind an “educational program
with posters about racing to make it
more interesting and television and
radio advertising. This sort of thing
is done in the U.S.”
His last job with the Shell Oil
Company had more to do with the
horseless carriage than horses, but he
did begin his career as a turf writer
in Western Australia. As he sees it, his
task now is “to make people realise
racing is not just a vast collection of
tote machinery but that there are
people involved. We want to make the
up-and-coming jockeys household names
in the way Bill Lawrie and Johnny
Raper are.”
One disadvantage in all this is that
people aren’t so fond of horses as they
may have been once. For one thing,
they don’t see so much of them any
more. But Mr. Bird is determined to
overcome all these handicaps in his
popularity stakes.
FULL CIRCLE
ART CRITICS wrangle over the
significance of “hard edge” painting and
Messrs. Bonython and Stern continue
to elevate the high-priced tip of the
Australian art market. But its unpub-
licised and traditionalist centre, as
represented by a thousand flower
studies and a thousand landscapes on
a thousand living-room walls, goes on
steady, unchanging, and lucrative.
Alan Baker, a Sydney painter who
has been turning out his meticulously
realistic paintings since 1945, has never
been able to meet the demand for his
Alan Baker ... chequebooks ready
work. His latest exhibition opened in
the gallery of Proud’s, a Sydney jewel-
lery store, at 11 o’clock one morning
recently. By one o’clock, a third of
the paintings were sold, and judging
by the number of middle-aged and
elderly women with chequebooks in
hand it seemed as if the whole business-
would be over by five o’clock.
The flower studies went first
Incarnata Camellia at $75, Pink Roses
at $2OO, Pink Japonica at $3OO. Next
came the landscapes— Westerly Change,
The Oaks ($130), and so on.
Baker, genial, dark-suited, with grey
hair and glasses, had come to the
exhibition from Camden, where he
paints in a studio near his house sur-
rounded by six and a half acres of
gum trees and fruit trees. Buyers either
come there to see his work or purchase
it from his dealers, who told him 23-
years ago that they would be able to
sell three of his paintings a week if he
could supply them “and it’s gone on
ever since until it’s impossible to meet
the demand.”
He has had only one previous one-
man exhibition last year in Bris-
bane although he now seems to be
making a habit of them, with plans for
two more next year.

You’re moving interstate
So who wants to pay to move an empty van?
You’re shifting to, say, Alice Springs.
Now, unless the removalist who quoted for your
move has a branch in that distant place, his
quote will have to include the expense of get-
ting the empty van back to Melbourne or
Sydney or wherever you moved from.
Not with Wridgways.
Wridgways have the largest network of branches
of any removalist in Australia. Name a place. If
Wridgways don’t have a branch there, at least
it’s on one of their many scheduled routes.
So you never pay to move an empty van. By
back-shipment of goods, Wridgways make sure
every van is full—at no extra cost to anyone.
And, because Wridgways operate scheduled
services, you never have to wait for a big van
to be filled; you move when you want to move.
Almost as fast as moving by air. And whoever
heard of paying to fly an empty airplane back
to base?

TERSONAL
STORAGE
can save
you money
To replace furniture costs money.
To store it is much more economical
than you might think.
So if you’re temporarily without
housing after selling, while build-
ing, overseas or for any other reason
think about storing your belong-
ings.
Wridgways offer Australia’s largest
storage facilities. All under cover.
And at Wridgways it’s Personal
Storage because it’s locked con-
tainer storage. This means that all
your goods are sealed in individual
containers. Well packed. Dust free.
Moth and mildew free. Free from
pilferage.
And private.
You won’t find storage quite this
good anywhere else.
And it costs no more than anywhere
else. Certainly much less than re-
buying.

paintings Sir Robert Menzies, the
N.S.W. Chief Justice, Sir Leslie Her-
ron, the National Librarian, Mr. Harold
White. Baker is a Fellow of the Royal
Art Society and often adjudicates the
representational sections of art competi-
tions. Modern art, he says, is “a refuge
of the incompetent.”
“It’s a short - cut. Young painters
leave tech, and before long one of
them has a one-man show. And abstract
art is a hard thing to judge. It’s diffi-
cult to tell whether it’s a good abstract
or whether it’s been done by a monkey.”
The human figure, he says, is the
basis of art. “You can tell people what
they should buy, but it’s the widows
and housewives using their instincts
who come along and buy. And people
do have an instinct about the best. I
know by the people who come to my
studio. Invariably, they pick the best
things there, even when they haven’t
had much experience of art.”
Mr. Baker also believes that “modern
art has been put over on the semi-
sophisticated public by a flood of clever,
hypnotic talk, and without these sly and
subtle sophistries, spun endlessly by
sensational critics and book editors, so-
called modern painting would have
quickly come to nothing.”
As we were leaving, we looked across
at the lengthening queue of women,
chequebooks ready. “It’s funny,” the
gallery director said, “I suppose you
could say traditional painting has fin-
ally become more controversial than
modern. Things have turned full circle.”
Taking one last look at Magnoliaflora
($130), we agreed.
IN THE BLOOD
MARGARET WEBSTER is a kind of
one-woman theatrical tradition. Her
family has been in the theatre for five
generations her mother was Dame
May Whitty, the British actress, her
father, Ben Webster, also an actor —■
and she, herself, is an actress, producer,
and creator of several one-man shows
with which she has been touring
Australia.
One is a Shakespearian anthology
(“excerpts put together by me with
sort of Scotch tape”), the other a re-
creation of the lives of the solitary
Bronte family in their bleak Yorkshire
village. She also does a program woven
around Shaw’s work (“not that I don
a white beard or anything”), but she
has left that out of her Australian tour,
since Max Adrian, another G.B.S.
interpreter, was here a short time ago.
Although her recitals are the only
facet of Miss Webster so far familiar
to Australian audiences, her versatility
is formidable she directed Paul
Robeson in “Othello,” “Richard II,”
with Maurice Evans, and was hired by
Rudolf Bing at the beginning of his
reign at the Metropolitan Opera House
in New York, to direct “Don Carlos.”
“I thought he must be mad. No, I’d
never worked in opera before, but I
suppose he wanted to bring theatrical
techniques to it. It was terribly difficult
the timing and trying to get the
singers to take their eyes off the
orchestra.”
The Robeson “Othello” was another
complex and, at first, seemingly impos-
sible project. It took her and the
others involved in the production five
years to convince managements to
accept the Negro singer in the role.
“We did it on our own initiative put
it on at a tryout theatre in Princeton,
where it went well, and it later moved
into New York. Once we’d done it, it
was a huge success.”
Although she was born in the United
States, Miss Webster grew up in Eng-
land, spent a year at drama school,
then worked in the small club theatres
in London, which “existed mainly to
dodge censorship.” There, her repu-
tation as an actress and later as a pro-
ducer established itself through her
work with people like John Gielgud,
Sybil Thorndike, and Lewis Casson.
And Maurice Evans invited her to go
to New York for “Richard II.”
“He wanted someone who could both
act and produce. I acted for a while,
then gradually turned to producing.
Only because I was asked. It would
have been marvellous to keep on acting
actors don’t know the facts of life.
They’re just looked after.”
Now grey-haired, with an accent
which seems to have resisted firmly the
effects of 30 years of life in America,
she lives on the East Coast island of
Martha’s Vineyard, spending part of
each year in London. “I used to share
a house with Pamela Frankau (the
novelist), until she died the summer
before last.”
To hear her tell it, her experiments
with her recital programs have been
simple developments arising quite natu-
rally out of boredom with the literary
lectures she used to give. She says
there’s more of Shakespeare than Mar-
garet Webster in the Shakespeare
anthology, while the Bronte program
happened accidentally, when she was
preparing a collection of excerpts from
the Bronte sisters’ books to be per-
formed in the same way as the Shake-
speare ones.
“I realised the story of their lives
was so much more exciting than the
material I’d planned to do. So I
decided on much more of a contem-
porary study of the Brontes. I use their
letters and the memoir by Mrs.
Gaskell.”
Before coming to Australia, she
directed a New York production of
“Carving a Statue,” by Graham Greene,
who, she says, is “a little oblique as
a playwright.” “This one wasn’t a suc-
cess people said there was too much
symbolism in it.” And after she returns
to the United States, she will be
correcting proofs of a book she has
written about her family in the theatre.
“I had a lot of help from my parents’
letters letters of Shaw’s to my
father, and Ellen Terry’s to my mother.”

THE BIG SELL
FOR THE
BIG SPENDERS
IT IS always Australia’s policy to be
loved by the United States at all times,
but there is a particular angle to this
which does not get a great deal of
publicity. That is to prove to Ameri-
cans that Australia is a desirable place
to visit and to woo as many of them
here as possible.
Indeed, we are working very hard at
wooing the Americans right now. The
Australian Tourist Commission
receives $1,750,000 a year from the
Government and it aims at extracting
another $500,000 from industry. This
year one-third of this will be spent on
North America. After all, the English
market is rather flat, New Zealand is
suffering the economic horrors, so the
best growth markets are North America
and Japan.
Last year we had 38,000 tourists
from North America, this year it will
be 47,000 and, God willing, next year
it will be over 60,001). The lovely thing
about Americans is that they spend
so well. The average American stays
two or three weeks and spends $7OO.
In a year that makes $3O million or
two-and-a-half F-l 1 Is.
Our big move is to get the conven-
tion of the American Society of Travel
Agents to take place in Sydney in 1971.
If this comes off it will be a coup
the equivalent of winning the Olympic
Games or a World Fair and more
profitable. Your correspondent contacted
Basil Atkinson, general manager of the
Australian Tourist Commission, immedi-
ately on his return from San Juan,
Puerto Rico, where the present con-
vention is taking place.
Basil Atkinson went there with an
Australian team of 22. The men wore
green blazers with a map and “Aus-
tralia 71” on the pocket, the girls wore
brilliant gold dresses symbolic of sun-
shine. They took over a “hospitality
suite” in the El San Juan Hotel. Actu-
ally it was a nightclub, but they got it
for four hours daily and all day on
Sunday. It was decorated as a Western
saloon and during the week all 3000
delegates came through. As each dele-
gate entered he had an “Australian 71”
badge and a gold kangaroo pinned
on his lapel. “Some liked to wear
their badge upside down, as symbolic of
being “Down Under,” according to
Basil. It was a good badge but they
had some strong rivalry from the Virgin
Islanders. Their badge read “I AM A
VIRGIN” then “Islander” in very
small letters. Everybody liked wearing
those.
Originally they planned to fly over
a stack of genuine Australian meat
pies, but this proved too difficult. It
didn’t work in with the hotel’s cater-
ing arrangements. However, it was very
hot in San Juan in September, so they
decided on a series of ice-cold cock-
tails with Australian names. There was
the Boomerang, the Walkabout, the
Surfers Hang Five, the Didgeridoo, the
Sundowner, the Sydney Sling, the
Jackaroo, the Waltzing Matilda, and
the Southerly Buster. The Bondi
Boomer, for example, was two portions
of gin, a portion of passionfruit, and
a dash of Angostura bitters.
Then they had 160 dozen bottles of
Fosters Lager. “But do you know,” said
Basil, “incredibly nearly everyone went
for the beer. They’d say ‘Boy, I like
this Australian beer, it's got a real
kick in it.’ Although I understand
under American law foreign beer must
have the same alcoholic content. Well,
they were so keen we ran out, and had
to fly down another 30 dozen from
New York.”
Part of the wooing process was to
show film, fly waratah from Sydney,
serve Australian wines. Then they gave
shows with the Le Garde twins singing
Aussie songs and putting on a whip-
cracking act.
Basil Atkinson said our biggest rivals
for 1971 were Brazil and Holland. Rio
produced a book for the convention
and Amsterdam turned on a fair on a
local island and spent $50,000. Basil
said the Amsterdam night was very hot
and sticky, a long bus ride out and not
a big success. Why, some of the dele-
gates even started singing “Waltzing
Matilda” on the way home.
We will know next May whether
those 3000 travel agents will come to
Sydney in 1971, and the racing odds,
according to Basil, are six to four on.
Well, how else are they spending
their money? They have made a whole
series of two-and-a-half-minute TV
news features on things like the Sydney-
Hobart yacht race. It’s not hard to get
these on U.S. TV news programs and
“First we have to find something Aus-
tralian to promote!”

they are claiming a potential audience
of 51 million. Then they do the same
with radio scripts to 2000 stations.
But the really crafty deal is with
those Rest and Recreation leave men
from Vietnam, now coming in soon
at the rate of 7000 a month. Imme-
diately they land the Tourist Com-
mission looks them over and asks if
they would care to be photographed
with a koala, a kangaroo, or even
better-looking fauna, like a Sydney
girl. This never misses. Then they send
a picture with news story back to the
R & R’s hometown newspaper.
Actually it does not work with the
New York “Times,” the Chicago “Tri-
bune,” or the Los Angeles “Times,” but,
by heavens, it works with all the
little ones.
Basil Atkinson brought out a file of
the clippings that had just arrived
and there were beaming soldiers with
their koalas, published in the Sacra-
mento “Bee,” the San Diego “Union,”
the Toledo “Blade,” and the Boulder
“Daily Camera.”
The idea is that all the folk in
Toledo, Boulder, Sacramento, and
wherever, will look at their home boy
having a terrific time in Sydney and
want to go there, too.
Then a great deal of money goes on
the hard sell, putting advertisements in
the “New Yorker,” “Look,” “Life,”
“Holiday,” and others.
This is terribly reassuring one
realises it is not really necessary to go
away after all. Here is the latest spread
appearing in a number of the glossies:
“IF YOU’VE SEEN THE GONDO-
LIERS IN VENICE YOU AIN’T
SEEN NOTHING YET.
“Still to be seen: brawny crews
battling waves two storeys high in a
surfboat race off Curl Curl beach.
“Or a chorus one hundred thousand
strong carolling by candlelight in the
Myer Music Bowl.
“Still to be seen: Sydney’s Opera
House with its billowing concrete sails
reflected in the improbable blue of the
harbor.
“And have you seen a city stop? It
happens on the first Tuesday in Novem-
ber when they run the Melbourne Cup.
Everything in Australia stops. Then, as
the thoroughbreds thunder home, a
nation cheers itself hoarse.
“Until you have seen the wonders
DOWN UNDER YOU AIN’T
SEEN NOTHING YET. Go ask your
Travel Agent.”
Or how about this? “Kings Cross, the
swingingest square mile. Anywhere.
You’ll hear half-a-dozen languages
before you stroll half a block. You can
buy a cup of Arabian coffee or a
Cantonese Dim Sim. Dine on Oysters
Kilpatrick, richer than Rockefeller.
You can blow you mind to the big
beat uptown. Cool in a candlelit
cavern downtown . .
Yes, once the rest of the world wakes
up to this billowing, brawny, carolling,
swingingest, thundering, improbable
big-beat Australia, the rest of the
world won’t have a chance.

Just the way it crouches low to the ground imparts the sensation of full flight! The new Dodge Phoenix
is a car with enormous power: under control but ready for release when you say so. Even the most
hardened sceptics are amazed by its agility and instant response. That’s easily understandable, too,
when you consider the size of the V 8 engines: a 318 cu. in. 230 b.h.p. or a 383 cu. in. 270 b.h.p. But
power alone is not enough. The Dodge Phoenix is also the ultimate in luxury, softness and silence.
Words are a poor substitute for your own sense of touch and feel. And that’s reason enough to see
your nearby Chrysler Dodge Phoenix dealer. Soon!

OUT AND ABOUT
Daphne Guinness
LOOKING AT THE
WORLD THROUGH
GIG LAMPS
IT IS noon on Friday and the girls
are shimmying into Jerry Lapin’s Cap-
rice restaurant, checking their makeup
via his mirrored wall and saying how
well everyone looks, how fabulously
brown, through their newest outsize
bronze tinted gig lamps, and what fun
this lunch, is gonna be. Trust Wiska
to produce another fun-idea. The last
one being can anyone forget?
that incredible Princess Soraya jag. It
is extraordinary how, all this time later,
ten months to be exact, Wiska Listwan
and Princess Soraya remain synonym-
ous. Anyway, for today’s fun-idea,
which is in aid of the Children’s
Medical Research Foundation, Mrs.
Listwan and her Cornucopia Com-
mittee have gathered unto the Caprice
a section of the Sydney set, the fun-
section that is, with the object of dis-
cusing after lunch “The Best of All
Worlds.” What the hell does that
mean? the more relaxed girls are ask-
ing. It was to have been “How To Be
International,” but that was discarded
as too snobby. And, says Mrs. Revlon
(Australia), a little conceited, too,
don’t you think? Right, then. Into the
routine. Part with entree card. Part
with $6.50. Part lips into a great Mary
Quant shiny all-purpose smile and enter
Mr. Lapin’s pink-pink-and-purple decor
with, as travel agent Dickie Keep puts
it, floating kidneys in the ceiling.
The panel is seated round a table
near the door in various relaxed
attitudes. Interior decorator Leslie Wal-
ford is lolling over 2GB’s Andrea and
wearing an out-of-this-world color
combination of green suit, blue-and-
pink shirt and electric-blue kipper tie.
Andrea’s beige. Couturier Vera Fels
flicks a mini-Isadora scarf. Comedienne
Anna Russell is nodding Shirley
Temple curls. Outfitter John Lane is
blazered and powder-blue turtle-necked,
which L. Walford says takes getting
used to. Film Producer Donald Wynne
is relaxing hard on his third whisky
and midway through his fourth beard
this year. And entrepreneur Harry
Miller makes a dramatic entrance in
his think-pink shirt and new floppy
hairdo, asking at once for the lavatory.
Is that, he wants to know, is that the
right word to use on this occasion?
Mrs. Listwan is looking anxious. She
is not at all sure how this thing will
work out, but that’s charity work the
world over. There are some people who
come to these lunches as a matter of
course, like art gallery openings. There
are others whose husbands don’t care
and they must dress up for someone.
And others who love saying they hate
them. Actually, says the rich, willowy
Patti Edwards, pushing up her gig
lamps and flicking in eyedrops all in

one movement, actually she’s here
because it sounded amusing. Yeah,
well, Dickie Keep is here, too, and
wishing they’d get on with it.
Mrs. Listwan has an announcement.
There is to be a lovely raffle, with lovely
whisky, lovely champagne, a lovely scarf
from Vera, and a lovely Hermes scarf
from John Lane which is not for now
but for a future occasion. Everyone
swivels to stare at Mr. Lane, who looks
a bit bashful about the whole thing.
Anyway, Andrea draws the raffle and
wins Vera’s scarf. Everyone is overcome
at the coincidence.
Around two o’clock the calories are
spreading and a certain restlessness is
setting in. Patti Edwards reaches for
her pills and sighs. If there is one thing
she can’t resist it is ice-cream. She has
demolished one and is halfway through
financier Frank Markovic’s when the
panel shuffles down to a large empty
table and sit with their backs to the
splendid harbor view. “And now”
announces Mrs. Listwan, if everyone will
give her a minute to speak, “and now
here is the panel in these exquisite
arrangements ready to discuss the best
of all worlds.”
A sea of mascaraed eyes, a little
flushed from white wine with a certain
Shylock gleam filtering through, fix on
to the panel. This had better be good.
Leslie rises and says this is not gonna
be serious, this is gonna be fun. Like
everyone is listening in on their conver-
sation. At the same time everyone can
learn something from his fellow panel-
lists who, after all, have something to
give. Dickie Keep rolls his eyes to Mr.
Lapin’s purple kidneys. My God, has
he given up three hours of his work-
ing day for this? So, we’ll kick a few
ideas around, continues Leslie. Now,
Vera; what about fashion? Vera says
she’s anti the leather-and-steel brigade,
she’s not mod couture. Andrea has a
question. Does Vera think she would
look good in a steel bra? Leslie is hav-
ing trouble with the microphone which
is mansize and is passed with difficulty
up and down the table. Conversation
turns to good taste. Oh, my God, good
taste. Harry Miller groans. Have Aus-
tralians got it or haven’t they? Yes,
says Vera. No, says John Lane, begging
Vera’s pardon. Not like the Italians or
the English. Let’s whitewash Bondi for
a start. H. Miller says hell, he’ll do
without the mike. Has anyone been to
Nottingham? To say the English have
class is just not true. But Andrea buys
all her pressies from Marks and Sparks.
One at a time, girls and boys, shouts
Leslie. Australians rubbish themselves,
booms Donald Wynne. Yeah, they have
an inferiority complex, says Andrea.
John Lane does need the mike but can-
not reach it . . . compared with other
countries Australia hasn’t begun to crawl
. . . and then Andrea is heard saying
to Vera, you know you told me to plug
you, and Vera says she was only joking,
anyway, Andrea got a scarf for noth-
ing .. .
“Vogue’s” Sheila Scotter is unable to
appear on the panel as publicised. She
has an engagement in Melbourne.


Comment by ‘Observer '
A STAFF OF THE PM's OWN
IT HAS NOT been one of the noted
functions of this column to defend Mr.
Gorton from his critics, but there is
one particular kind of criticism now
being made of him that considering
from whom it comes seems quite
■outrageous. This is the criticism ’of him
for trying to build up a staff of his own
in the Prime Minister’s Department.
The reason .why this - criticism is out-
rageous is that some of it is coming
from the. very people who last year were
■urging '.Mr. Holt to' do exactly the
same thing and who this year praised
Mr. Gorton when he first became Prime
Minister because of reports that he was
going to install his own “think tank.”
It is true that it is one of the ironies
of political change that you might
spend part of your life urging some
reform.and' then spend the rest of your
life regretting the results of the reform
when it happens. But in this case Mr.
Gorton:- simply seems to be beginning to
carry out’the prescription exactly as we
armchair 'prime ministers ordered it
for him. Whether ..the people he is
picking are'the right people or not is
one thing. But the way he is going
about it seems unexceptionable.
That the appointment of a relatively
Treasury official to a key posi-
tion in the Prime Minister’s Depart-
ment has aroused the resentment of
some senior Govern’ment officials does
not in itself settle things. What on earth
does it matter that Mr. G. J. Tredin-
nick, 44, has gone up six grades in
public-service status and $3200 in salary
in his jump from the Treasury to the
Prime Minister’s Department? The
point is going to be whether or not Mr.
Tredinnick will be any good at his new
job.
Modern political leaders need expert
staffs around them, and they should be
allowed to gather them from whatever
sources they like. Grade II chief finance
officers, ex-editors of “The Age”
wherever their fancy takes them. Con-
comitantly, those who accept these jobs
shouldn’t be surprised if they lose them
when the next Prime Minister comes
along. A Prime Minister is in a very
special position in a government and,
unless he sees himself as nothing but
the chairman of a com'mittee, he has to
have some people sorting things out for
him. Methods differ. Some political
leaders pick up their best ideas at
dinner; others, like Sir Robert Menzies,
learn to make use of the whole appa-
ratus of government. Mr. Gorton wants
a personal staff in his own back room.
In this he is nojt extraordinary.
In fact we can expect very little from
him until he has it. He seems to have
a very individualistic view of himself as
Prime Minister, and if he (or any other
political leader anywhere in the world)
simply relied on his own resources he
would make a fool of himself ■— and
of Australia. It is true that things might
be awful if he picks the wrong men.
It is quite relevant to question, as
some critics have, whether the best fish
to have swimming in your “think tank”
are those who have so far been distin-
guished as administrators, not policy-
makers. But what we should do is wait
and see how they go. And if, as some
have hinted, Mr. Gorton wants them as
administrators and has some dream of
somehow running the country himself
well it will be interesting to see him
come a cropper. After all, in theory,
perhaps even in practice, if Mr. Gorton
makes a muck of the Prime Minister-
ship, his Party or the nation could
try someone else.
The questions of how Mr. Gorton
himself will go as Prime Minister are
in this regard less important than
the fact that what Mr. Gorton is doing
now all future Prime Ministers will go
on doing tomorrow. Government offi-
cials will have to work out ways of
accommodating themselves to this
change. So far as this represents a
threat to their promotion prospects we
cannot give them our sympathies. The
rest of us are in that boat already. So
far as it will represent a livening of
government, an unloosening of the
“normalities” that were invented and
then became rigid in the Menzies
period, it must be welcomed, even if
things go wrong for a while. And many
Government officials, including perhaps
the best of them, may later find that a
loosening of old normalities may be
more of a liberation to them than a
threat. It might mean that they end
up getting a better go.
At the same time, as a politician,
Mr. Gorton should pay a bit more
attention to getting himself more sup-
port among the senior officials in the
departments, or some of them. If he
imagines he can get away with alien-
ating most of them, he has another
think coming. It will be our loss as
well as his if morale in the public
service which has not been too good
since he arrived—becomes lower. There
is little doubt that a resentful public
service would get the better of him.
Apart from anything else, this is a
matter of expediency. As a politician,
Mr. Gorton should know that he doesn’t
live in an ideal world and that his
job is to get things done.
TWO VIEWS ON AUSTRALIAN OIL
Comment by Alan Reid
AUSTRALIA’S oil future was last
week the subject of conflicting view-
points. The Minister for National
Development, David Fairbairn,. was
guardedly optimistic. So was Mr. W. M.
Leonard, managing director of Ampol.
Sir lan McLennan, managing director
of BHP Pty. Ltd., was almost deter-
minedly pessimistic.
Said Mr. Fairbairn, addressing the
American Chamber of Commerce at
a Melbourne luncheon on Septem-
ber 16: “I would certainly say that in
three years we would be able to pro-
duce in Australia all the crude that
can be used by the Australian market.
This would mean an improvement in
our balance of payments of about
$250,000,000 a year.”
Said Mr. Leonard, addressing a
marketing seminar in Canberra: “My
own company’s discoveries with our
associates in Western Australia, parti-
cularly at Barrow Island (together with
the more major and substantial dis-
coveries in the Bass Strait) look as if
they will be of sufficient quantity by
1972 to satisfy between 50 and 60 per-
cent of Australia’s requirements. I am
encouraged to believe that within a
decade we will make further discoveries
and we could have sufficient oil to
satisfy 100 percent of our demand.”
Said Sir lan, addressing the National
Press Club, also in Canberra: “Let us
keep the whole (oil) development in
perspective. On present figures, the
Gippsland Basin and all the other oil
fields so far found in Australia will not
be producing anything like the coun-
try’s needs in say 1970. And if, during
the ensuing 20 years, Australia is to
become self-sufficient in oil, we will
need to find reserves ten times greater
than those already found at such great
cost.”
Put those statements together and
you get a very confused picture. Mr.
Fairbairn’s is the official picture, cau-
tious yet hopeful. Mr. Leonard’s is the
most optimistic. BHP’s, as enunciated
by Sir lan McLennan, is the most
pessimistic.
BHP is not entirely disinterested.
McLennan wants continuance of the
incentives for the discovery and pro-,
duction of Australian oil, which are
under threat because of the likelihood
that they could result in Australian
motorists being charged more for their
petrol. BHP had to outlay enormous
sums to develop its Bass Strait oil-
fields, where recovery from depths ex-
ceeding the norm elsewhere in the

world means, in McLennan’s colorful
phrase, that BHP and its partner, Esso,
are “working at the frontier of techni-
cal knowledge.”
BHP’s anxiety is understandable.
Despite the immensity of its operations,
it is developing on a scale that leaves
it permanently short of cash. Even
with its giant resources, development
capital is a problem, and, as McLen-
nan, a managerial rather than a capital-
istic type, has pointed out himself, the
spectacular rise in BHP shares over
recent months does not give the com-
pany a penny more in working capital.
But important as is the confusion for
the investor and would-be investor, it
is even more important to the defence
planner. While the investor stands to
lose only his money much more could
be sacrificed if defence planning is
based upon faulty premises.
Two recent academic publications,
both of which have a defence aspect,
are even more determinedly pessimis-
tic than Sir lan McLennan.
In “Oil Supply in Australia’s Defence
Strategy,” a strategic and defence
studies publication put out by the Aus-
tralian National University, Dr. Alex
Hunter writes, “. . . at this point of
time, despite recent successes, the (oil)
picture is not all fair. Before 1966-67
exploration, drilling in Australia was
all onshore and mainly inland. And,
although ample strikes of natural gas
were made, the crude-oil discoveries
were disappointing and high cost . . .
(the) Moonie and Alton oil is pro-
tected by a formula which requires
refiners to pay about $U.5.1.15 per bar-
rel more than the prices for foreign
crudes. It is clearly marginal produc-
tion that could not persist without
some such support-price scheme, and
reports indicate that the field, after
four years’ production, has already
passed its flush period . . . thus during
what may be termed the inland phase
of exploration for oil the results were
disappointing.”
On the offshore operations, Dr.
Hunter is more optimistic. He points
out that the Gippsland discoveries
pushed the success ratio to 17 percent
for the whole of Australia. If this ratio
were maintained and bettered it would
not be unreasonable for Australia to
look for self-sufficiency around the
period 1975-80.
In “Consumption and Production of
Petroleum from the Australian Main-
land, 1968-69,” produced by the De-
partment of Geography at the School
of General Studies of the Australian
National University, Mr. K. Stacey
comments: “. . . how can we reconcile
the poor discovery record with the
great hopes that have been aroused?”
Stacey argues that the incentive
should not be continued and that
Esso-BHP will not stop either produc-
ing or exploring if the incentive is re-
moved. Offsetting Fairbairn’s
$250,000,000 savings in foreign ex-
change if domestic oil is substituted for
imported, Stacey claims that there
would be $100,000,000 flowing back to
the United States and Esso.

AUSTRALIA
Federal Labor stages
a real cliffhanger
ALP Senate Leader Murphy
Federal secretary Wyndham
Senator Cohen
Gough Whitlam .. . caught
between Executive and
Caucus
THE STORY OF how Federal Labor
decided last week to oppose the Federal
Commissioner’s redistribution proposals
in Queensland but not in New South
Wales was a classic cliffhanger.
Its background was simple enough:
Parliamentary Party Leader Whitlam
and Federal secretary Wyndham
wanted desperately to block the elec-
toral redistribution proposals in both
States, and Mr. Whitlam’s original
tactics had been to launch a High
Court challenge to the redistribution
rather than in Parliament. But when
the Party’s legal committee consulted
Professors Zelman Cowan and Geoffrey
Sawer on the chances of such a chal-
lenge, both calculated that it was
extremely unlikely to be upheld, though
it would not be immediately thrown
out of court: it could have a delaying
effect of perhaps two weeks, but the
cost would be upward of $30,000. After
seven meetings of the legal committee,
Mr. Whitlam was finally reconciled to
dropping his challenge.
Meanwhile, the Whitlam camp had
come across the minority report of
one of the electoral commissioners, Mr.
I. Weise, who differed quite radically
from the majority recommendations for
redistribution in Queensland. As a
result, a meeting of the Parliamentary
Caucus called for a special Federal
Executive meeting to consider taking up
this point and reconsidering the earlier
decision not to contest the redistribu-
tion proposals. Secretary Wyndham
telephoned around, asking members of
the Executive whether they wanted to
hold a formal meeting to discuss an
attack on the redistribution proposals
for N.S.W. and Queensland. They said
they didn’t, and it was announced there
would not be a meeting.
Mr. Whitlam was dissatisfied and
asked for soundings on how the Execu-
tive might vote. When these revealed
that Mr. Whitlam would have the
numbers after all, it was decided to
hold simultaneous Caucus and Federal
Executive meetings in Canberra last
Wednesday, get policies straightened
out, and go into Parliament with them
in the afternoon. So Wednesday morn-
ing was when the cliffhanging began.
The Federal Executive was to meet
in Cyril Wyndham’s fourth-floor suite
over the Commonwealth Employment
Service in Canberra’s Civic Centre at
9 a.m., so that there could be a
recommendation for Caucus at 10.30
a.m. The legislation was to be brought
into Parliament by the Government at
3.15, so the schedule was tight if the
Parliamentary Members were going to
plan their debating strategy.
Timing began to go astray when one
plane into Canberra was late and
Queensland delegate to the Federal
Executive, Tom Burns, did not arrive
until after 10 a.m. The Victorian dele-
gates did not arrive at all, having
declared the special meeting unconstitu-
tional. Then the Executive took four
hours to reach a decision, so Caucus
met at 10.30 and adjourned after a
hasty call from Mr. Wyndham’s staff to
the Party Room in Parliament, telling
Caucus nothing was moving at the
Executive meeting.
In the Executive, Mr. Whitlam was
quickly beaten on the idea of opposing
the redistribution proposals in N.S.W.,
although the margin was slim: eight to
seven. Labor’s Senate Leader, Lionel
Murphy, stood firm, but his deputy,
Senator Cohen, voted with the Queens-
land, S.A., W.A., and Northern Terri-
tory delegates to down Mr. Whitlam.
The debate in the Civic Centre suite
raged on over the High Court challenge
and the Queensland redistribution
(which the DLP had said it would
support in the Senate). There was little
support for the costly High Court
challenge and it went down. Finally,
opposing the Queensland redistribution
was put to the vote and the Whitlam
camp won through.
It was a handsome victory: 13 to 2,
and in the end Mr. Chamberlain and
his colleague said they had only voted
against the motion because they had
been bound by their State Caucus. But
the way was clear for Mr. Whitlam to
report to his waiting Caucus, and he
dashed from the Civic Centre build-
ing, only to have his car caught in
the jam of public servants returning
to work after lunch.
When the long-adjourned Parliamen-
tary Caucus finally met at 2 p.m., Mr.
Whitlam ran into more trouble. Two
N.S.W. parliamentarians, Mr. Devine
and Senator Douglas McClelland,
attacked the Executive’s decision not
to contest the redistribution proposals
for their State, declaring that Labor
was accepting a gerrymander which
would make it almost impossible for
it to win government. When Mr. Whit-
lam had the gag moved because he
had to state the Party’s attitude in
Parliament within three-quarters of an
hour, Mr. Bryant (Victoria) responded
angrily, “The Party has been grossly
betrayed.” He claimed it was now im-
possible for Labor to win an election.
Anyway, the cliffhanger was over,
even if some of the Party’s men were
very dissatisfied. In the Senate during
the next 24 hours, Labor and the DLP
combined to block the Queensland re-
distribution proposals. In the debate


DLP Leader Senator Gair said: “We
consider it desirable that , the three
(Queensland) Commissioners meet
again in an endeavor to reach unani-
mous agreement.” Referring to the pos-
sibility that such a move might prevent
the Government holding an early elec-
tion, Senator Gair said, “The Govern-
ment is totally unable to make a case to
justify taking the Parliament to the
country 14 months before the life of
the present Parliament expires. The
Government enjoys a record majority
in the House of Representatives. There
is no major political issue on which
the Government should seek the
opinion of the electorate. The DLP in-
tends, by opposing the Queensland
recommendation, to give the Minister
for the Interior, Mr. Nixon, the oppor-
tunity to refer back to the Commission-
ers a recommendation rejected by one
House of the Parliament.”
Though the debate on the redistri-
bution proposals could wreck the
Government’s timetable if it has an
election in mind, there is no legal or
constitutional barrier to the Govern-
ment holding an election on new boun-
daries in five States and on the old
boundaries in Queensland. But the
Government could decide that, as the -
Parliament still has over a year to
run, political morality demanded that
the election should be held on new
boundaries for all the States, including
Queensland.
SABAH
NOT BUGGING IN
SINCE THE Australian Government
has been trying to play the Sabah
dispute cool, it has been pleased that
there has not been a single question
on the subject in Parliament, nor any
pressure for an official statement. This
is not to say that Australia hasn’t
got a position. It recognises the existing
border between the Philippines and
Malaysia and rejects the Filipino claim.
But it doesn’t want to make a fuss
about it. In particular it does not intend
to allow Australian troops to become
automatically involved against the
Philippines, although if the Filipinos
really ran amok, Sukarno style (which
is extremely unlikely), Australia would
probably be there.
The Government has given the
Malaysians an assurance that Australian
troops will not be withdrawn if things
get hot which seemed easy enough
to do since the troops are all at Teren-
dah safely on the mainland of Malaysia.
This does mean that in the event of
all-out war and an invasion of main-
land Malaysia, Australia wouldn’t bug
out. But it’s not going to bug in either.
The Government wants the Malay-
sians to believe that Australia will not
become an all-purpose guarantor for
Malaysia in the British style. But it
seemed to be going about this in an
unnecessarily tough -way last Wed-
nesday when the Malaysian Ambassador
in Canberra, Dato Stephens, seeking an
interview with Prime Minister Gorton,
was told that Mr. Gordon Freeth, a
junior Minister acting as Minister for
External Affairs in Mr, Hasluck’s
absence, would deal with the matter.
When he visited Mr. Freeth on Thurs-
day, Dato Stephens came away most
unhappy.
He had been told by Mr. Freeth
that the Australian Government
assessed the Filipino threats as mere
election gimmickry, and that the Fili-
pinos had neither the wish nor the
capacity to launch any serious military
action. For that reason alone there was
no need to add to the dispute by forcing
Australia to join the propaganda battle.
In addition there was something of a
threat when Mr. Freeth pointed out
that the present Australian defence
reappraisal might not go well for
Malaysia if it looked as though the
Malaysians were likely to pressure
Australia into involvement in every
minor dispute.
The Canberra line is that Malaysian
Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman
and Deputy Prime Minister Tun Razak
are satisfied with Australia’s non-
involvement. Tun Razak is said to have
confirmed this in a Press conference
in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday.
Meanwhile in Manila the Australian
Freeth ... no propaganda battle
Embassy is busy trying to keep things
as cool as they are in Canberra. There
was a minor incident when Australian
warships in convoy with a British
flotilla were said to have been warned
off and told that in future they would
have to get permission before they
entered Philippine waters. But this is
now straightened out, and Australia will
continue to notify its naval movements,
but not seek permission.
Australian relations with the Philip-
pines have never been close. Many of
the most Asia-minded people in the
External Affairs Department have
something close to a blank in their
minds when it comes to the Philippines.
But they do see the Philippines in a
wider context than a purely regional
one in the context of ASPAC,
SEATO, ECAFE, Vietnam and they
are now remembering this context.
THE F-111
ACT OF FAITH
PEOPLE CLOSE to the Government
are trying to shrug off the F-11l affair
as irrelevant. And, of course, in one
sense it is. It was the decision not of
Mr. Gorton, nor of his predecessor,
but of the Prime Minister before that.
Similarly, it was not Defence Minister
Fairhall who was involved but the late
Mr. Athol Townley, also at two re-
moves.
The present Government could easily
plead innocence to charges that it be
held responsible for the way the original
decision was made, The personnel of
the Government has changed quite
radically in the four years since Sir
Robert Menzies announced the order
for the plane. But the F-11l case is
potent anti-Government material for
all that.
One reason is that the Government’s
PR handling hasn’t notably improved
as time has passed and the project pro-
ceeded, As recently as a month ago
Mr, Fairhall was saying optimistic
things about the plane that now have
political danger. And the cost esti-
mates have been covered up in some-
thing of the manner of the VIP affair.
With the tabling of documents in the
Senate last week, it became clear that
the present estimated cost of $U.5.294
million announced in Parliament last
session was in fact available to the
Government and the subject of high-
level correspondence a full year earlier,
a time at which quite different figures
were being put out..
The docutnents also show quite in-
controvertibly what could before be
dismissed as propagandist and unproven
assertion namely the Government in
1963 rushed headlong into the F-11l
deal, hurrying to get out an announce-
ment before the election. There was,
to be sure, quite thorough technical
evaluation of the F-11l and alternative
bombers by the Air Force. But there
was no attempt whatever to sew up the
deal with the United States to safe-
guard Australian interests. In the hurry,
a deal proposed by U.S. Defence Sec-
retary McNamara was accepted in days
by Mr. Townley, without amendment.
There was no negotiation whatever. And
while the technical evaluation was
thorough there appears to have been
no attempt to get economic or legal
advice. The Treasury appears not to
have been consulted about the financial
implications, or asked to give any esti-
mate of the cost-effectiveness of this
plane as opposed to alternatives. It
appears also there was no legal advice
on the need to insert escape clauses or
get the agreement framed in a way
which would protect Australia.
In October, 1963, the Australian
Government rushed off a letter of
acceptance of McNamara’s “Memo-
randum of Understanding” one day,
then announced the order in Parlia-
ment the next, and an election the
third day.
Only in June, 1964, was a detailed


“technical arrangement” agreed, which
showed for the first time the expensive
complexities of the project. Even then
the Government agreed to a clause
saying that corrections to the plane or
replacements of parts found faulty
would be made at the expense of the
Australian Treasury.
No attempt appears to have been
made to negotiate any ceiling price
until the British got into the act and
negotiated one. From the beginning, the
■deal appears to have been treated as
an act of faith in the United States
rather than as a hard-headed defence
deal.
The present Government is in trouble
because it doesn’t make itself look as
if it has learned the lessons of the
mistakes of its predecessors. Mr. Fair-
hall got himself seriously in trouble
last year with his claim that the F-11l
would be good value “whatever the
cost,” and Mr. Gorton, in tabling the
documents, repeated the ’mistake. In a
flourishing series of phrases, he de-
clared: “The second best is not good
enough for any defence requirement
that we have ... it is not expensive for
a nation which needs the best in the
world.” This, of course, ignores the
point that in buying the “best in the
world” in bombers (and it has yet to
be proven they are the best) Australia
is sacrificing the best of a lot of other
things the best of artillery, of tanks,
of transport aircraft, of helicopters, and
so on and is doing without quantity in
demanding the best in quality. The
RAAF’s interest in scientific excellence
on the frontiers of technological inno-
vation can make inroads into the rest
of the Defence budget.
IMMIGRATION
NO "ASIAN HORDES"
MR. BILLY SNEDDEN, the normally
fluent Immigration Minister, was
unusually reticent when winding up the
debate on his Department’s annual ex-
penditure in Parliament last week. Not
once in his four-minute summary of
the two-and-a-half-hour debate did
Snedden mention the issue uppermost in
Members’ minds—Asian immigration,
or “non-European” immigration as his
Department euphemistically call it.
Snedden had set the tone for the
debate at question time earlier in the
day when he flatly declared that it was
not Government policy to create a
multi-racial society in Australia. “The
purpose of this policy is to maintain
the homogeneity of the Australian
people and to avoid the creation of
enclaves of bitterness or dissension
which have bedevilled so many other
countries,” he said.
But Snedden was taking an unusually
hard line here. Actually he has usually
been very adept in selling the liberal-
ised policy on Asian immigration
adopted by the Government in March,
1966. Under this policy, the Australian
Government accepts “non-European
immigrants” on the basis of their cap-
acity to settle here and to integrate into
the Australian community, and their
possession of skills “of positive value to
Australia.”
The success of this policy was
evident in the debate on the Immigra-
tion Department’s estimates. Even
dyed-in-the-wool “white Australia” men
loudly proclaimed their support of the
Government’s policy. Open advocates
of change, such as Sydney Liberal
MHR Ted St. John, said they only
wanted to expand the present policy
and certainly did not support the old
bogy of opening the door to the so-
called “Asian hordes.”
Mr. St. John gave by far the Inost
lucid account of the case for change.
Newcastle Labor MHR Charles Jones
St. John ... 1000 a year
had claimed that “only an imbecile”
would advocate any breaking down of
present immigration policy. “I declare
myself an imbecile,” St. John replied.
“I do not believe that this question of
race prejudice can be solved by estab-
lishing any cordon sanitaire around
Australia.”
St. John acidly commented on Gov-
ernment claims that the present policy
was to preserve racial homogeneity: “It
would be highly dangerous if we were
to e'mphasise our desire for homogeneity
merely as a mask for racial feeling, a
luxury for which the price is altogether
too high in the modern world.”
He argued that, as “the best-informed
estimates” put Asian immigration at
about 1000 people a year, Australia
was gradually achieving a widespread
intake of non-Europeans. Figures sup-
plied to The Bulletin by the Immigra-
tion Department reveal that what St.
John suspected is correct. In fact, his
estimate of 1000 a year is less than
half of the actual figure.
The departmental figures show that
since the liberalisation in March, 1966,
the Government has approved immigra-
tion applications from 1475 non-
Europeans. As each immigrant brings
an average of two dependants, this
brings the total inflow to about 4500,
or something more than 2000 a year.
These figures do not include the “seed”
immigration of families of Asians
already in Australia, so the actual figure
would be well over 2000.
The figures also indicate that the flow
of Asian immigration is building up
from the slow start immediately after
the 1966 liberalisation. Of the 1475
approvals, only 256 have actually
arrived in Australia, indicating a con-
siderable upsurge of applications in
recent months. Immigration officials,
too, have not been over-anxious to reject
immigration applications from qualified
Asians. Only 334 have been rejected
since the liberalisation.
Government immigration policy then,
while appealing to “white Australia”
supporters on the one hand, is slowly
edging open the door to Asian im-
migrants with the other. Small wonder
that Snedden was loath to join the
argument.
RELIGION
RENDING OR SEWING?
AS THE POET of Ecclesiastes said, for
everything there is a season. A time to
rend and a time to sew: a time to keep
silence and a time to speak. For an
assorted group of dissenting Melbourne
priests, the times for silence or speech
had, in their various ways, arrived last
week. For the Reverend David Pope,
the bearded, agnostic “rebel” activist,
the time was definitely one of silence.
Mr. Pope raised a nation of Anglican
eyebrows in April with his belief that
if God exists He exists where human
love and concern are given. He said he
wanted to “give the idea of God a
rest.”
His young wife, Paddy, met re-
porters at the door with an impene-
trable, “He’s gone interstate for a time.”
On the day that fellow-clergyman Dr.
Malcolm Mackay in Parliament called
Mr. Pope a purveyor of subversion and
sedition, she said she was rather glad
that her husband wasn’t in town. Some-
how, she said, the news had leaked out
that Mr. Pope had resigned his priestly
faculties and had also nominated for
the seat of Batman, now held by
Captain Sam Benson. Mrs. Pope
Lane ... “enough said”


doubted that her husband would be
talking about either decision when he
returned.
For the Reverend Peter Lane, whose
parish is also in an industrial inner-city
area, it was a time of “enough said.”
Mr. Lane had supported Mr. Pope’s
stand in April and had suffered from
the same reaction. He said he would
let Bishop Arnott’s statement speak for
hi'm. By coincidence, the Vicar-General’s
statement, which disclosed that Lane
was resigning from his Kensington
combined parish to take on secular
work, came at the same time as the
news of Mr. Pope’s resignation from t?ie
Church. Bishop Arnott said he wanted
to make it perfectly clear that no
pressure was put on either to make
them offer their resignations.
For Fathers Crotty and Phelan, the
two radical Catholic priests whose
pastoral duties were suspended by Arch-
bishop Knox for their stand on the
Pill and the question of Papal
authority, it was a time of exile. Father
Phelan left for Sydney, while Father
Nicholas Crotty, the Professor of Moral
Theology at the Passionist Fathers’
Templestowe seminary, accepted a posi-
tion as an assistant at St. Joseph’s
Church in Hobart.
Only for the Reverend Neil Glover
was it a time for speech. Having been
expelled from his vicarage in late
January for having married again after
his divorce, he has now launched an
appeal against the finding of the
Pope ... a time for travel
Diocesan Tribunal which declared him
guilty of “conduct disgraceful of a
clergyman and productive or likely to
be productive of scandal or evil report.”
Curiously enough, the lawyer who
has found fresh grounds for appeal,
Mr. Frank Galbally, is one of the
prominent Catholic laymen who have
declared their support for Fathers
Phelan and Crotty.
Mr. Glover will also have another
opportunity for speech. This week his
column starts in Melbourne “Truth,”
the same weekly newspaper that has
faithfully reported every incident of his
life since his marriage to a pretty, young
parishioner.
The moot point remaining was
whether all these actions amounted to
rending or sewing.
Premier Askin’s Budget speech last week
NEW SOUTH WALES
PAUL REVERE BUDGET
WHEN, IN mid-September, Mr.
Askin, the Premier of New South
Wales, launched his guerilla war on
the Gorton-McMahon junta at the
annual gatherings in Sydney Town
Hall of loyal Liberals from all over
New South Wales, the audience was
not satisfied with three deafening
cheers; they insisted on six. But some
Federal politicians were seen ostenta-
tiously refusing not only to cheer but
even to clap. “A pre-Budget tactic,”
they muttered. “Thinks he’s Paul
Revere.” (Like saying “He must be
mad. He thinks he’s Premier of New
South Wales.”)
But the “pre-Budget tactic” thepie
stuck and added to the belief that Mr.
Askin was preparing a Horror Budget
and needed to use Mr. Gorton and
Mr. McMahon as an excuse. As it
turned out, it was tough but by no
means a horror. (Perhaps this was his
real tactic: prepare for the worst, so
that what happened would bring relief,
not horror.) The Labor Opposition
seemed in a good mood as they watched
the Premier try to put a bold face on
it, but there were few interjections,
and no signs of theatrical rage. They
smiled like starving cats before the
cream bowl when the Premier advised
them avuncularly to approach his Bud-
get the way he had approached their
Budget in 1962.
There was not much good news.
There will be a total deficit of $413m.,
and except for small surprises in Rail-
ways and Maritime Services a deficit
in each fund or undertaking. Con-
solidated Revenue will be $667m., but
payments which go to everything
that counts, especially education
($237m.) and health ($100m.) will
be s67lm. Railways will earn s23Bm.
and pay out only s2o4rh. Buses will
earn $28.6'm., but pay out s33m. Mari-
time Services s2lm., but pay out sl6m.
Charges will go up. Increased hos-
pital fees have to help cover the s3om.
increase in wages and improved nurs-
ing conditions. Increased fares have to
help meet a slsm. increase in the
Railways wages bill.
The introduction of the turnover
tax 1 cent in each $lO was
inevitable, and in New South Wales
will not be extended to wages. In a
full year it will bring in s2om., but
it will not operate until February 1,
1969, and will only be worth s4.Bm.
(Poker machine taxes give s24£m. to
the Hospital Fund.) Land taxes, how-
ever, are reduced (the 15 percent re-
bate on primary production land in-
creased to percent as a step to-
ward elimination of the tax).
On the bright side, spending on
education will increase so that includ-
ing building costs New South Wales is
now spending $1 million a day on
education. Teacher trainee scholarship
allowances will go up 10 percent and
the “State Aid” payments for inde-
pendent (i.e., largely Catholic) school
children will go up: from $l2 to $24
per primary child and from $lB to
$2B per eligible secondary child (the
means will also be eased).
A Go-Slow Budget. There is little
sign of Premier Askin being able to
finance the New Era. Inevitably he
repeated the facts about the “unfair
deal” New South Wales was getting
from the centralist junta in Canberra
and said he was sick of Canberra get-
ting the affluence while the people of
Australia get the effluents.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
NO VOTES AT 18
LAST WEEK THE debate in the South
Australian House of Assembly on the
Opposition motion proposing voting,
drinking, and contractual rights for 18-
year-olds continued to arouse Members’
passions. While the Government is not
prepared to act on the. matter at the
present time, its manner suggests that
it might consider introducing a Bill of
its own with similar provisions in the
future, though it feels such changes
should be made in concert with other
States and the Commonwealth.
The debate produced some startling
emotional arguments against the
measure by Government backbenchers.
Apparently believing that the very
moral fibre of the State would dis-
integrate were the Bill to pass, their
arguments against the measure ranged
from Student Action in Asia and
Mexico to the lack of religious instruc-
tion in American schools.
The Member for the country elec-
torate of Eyre, Mr. Edwards, held firstly
that the 60,000 additional voters would
grossly upset the Electoral Reform Bill
to be placed before Parliament shortly,
and in addition that it was unjust to
expect students who were giving time
to serious study to have the burden of
voting rights thrust upon them. Ques-
tioning the Opposition’s motives, he
said he did not wish to see the State’s
young people used as political footballs
and continued: “I am sure young
people do not want this responsibility
placed on them at 18 years of age.
Would the Member of Whyalla like to
see a few more Andrew Jones’?”
The member for Barossa, Mrs. Byrne,
followed with the Opposition’s case, re-
marking that “the age of 21 survives
as the age of maturity more because
of legal convenience and medieval cus-

tom than because of biological neces-
sity.” The LCL Member for Gumeracha
then took up the debate with an im-
passioned plea for the rejection of the
measure. Remarking that he considered
it to be one of the most important
measures introduced in the House for
many years, he quoted State statistics
showing that the number of bridegrooms
aged 18 had risen from eight to well
over 200 between 1903 and 1966, while
in the same period brides aged 18 had
risen from 93 to well over 800. On
this kind of evidence he held that 18-
year-olds are much more mature today
than they were 50 years ago. But he
did not take his own point. Responsi-
bility and privilege should be earned, he
said; going on to speak of a young
schoolteacher he had recently spoken
to who wanted to spend the rest of her
life being 18.
On the subject of drinking rights for
18-year-olds, Mr. Giles held that drink-
ing led to drugs among young people
and that were the Bill to be passed in
South Australia the kinds of problems
that beset America could occur here—
which can’t be much consolation for
New South Wales and Victoria, where
J 8-year-olds already have drinking
Reaching a high note, Mr. Giles
pleaded, “Do not let us be the insti-
gators of legislation that will reduce our
standing and lead us to a point of no
return. Statesman is the name of an
apple as well as a term applied to cer-
tain politicians. When one apple rots It
immediately affects the surrounding
apples.”
“Now we are getting to the core of
things,” remarked an Opposition Mem-
ber.
THE WEST
"LASH" SHIPPING
IN THE WEST’S Pilbarra and Kim-
berley regions concepts of the new
pioneers have been scaled up to match
the impressive environment in a way
that never fails to leave visitors
slightly breathless. And into this area
Knox ... in a big way
as big as all Britain it is now planned
to introduce a method of shipping to
challenge containerisation a “lash”
or lighter-aboard-ship concept that
packs barges on ships then pushes them
ashore rather like big floating con-
tainers.
The idea was first explored some
years ago by the old West Australian
Coastal Shipping Commission, but has
now been taken up in a big. way (only
way he knows how to operate it) by
the West’s one-man “think tank” John
E. Knox, who was being paid more
than Premier David Brand when he
took up the appointment of Director
General of Transport. Backing him on
this, Transport Minister Ray O’Connor
is emerging as a real force in the
Western Australian Cabinet, along with
Mr. Charles Court, Minister for the
North-West.
Their problem: a necessary shipping
service, losing $2.4 million annually,
which will have hoisted its prices three
times in four years on October next,
and which operates along a 2000-mile
run with 17 stop-over points from
Geraldton to Groote Eylandt, most
offering only poor port facilities. To
overcome this situation, the W.A.
Cabinet has decided in principle to
explore new transportation methods,
and the “lash” concept is the most
likely, with its proponents seeking
almost door-to-door service, challenging
containers even more closely.
All this is subject to cost. Two barge-
carrying ships would be needed to set
up the service, with perhaps 40 to 60
barges. Designs have been submitted
to Britain’s Yarrow Admiralty Research
Department, a subsidiary of Yarrow
and Company, and another will come
from U.S. naval architects Friede Gold-
man; barge-carrying ships are being
used along the American coast, with a
transatlantic service contemplated.
Pressure is being exerted on the Com-
monwealth to back the scheme. The
“West Australian” last week editorial-
ised: “The Federal Govern'ment, which
is well aware of Western Australia’s
urgent need of money for development,
would be open to strong criticism if it
rejected such a request soon after
denying Premier Brand’s well-grounded
plea for special housing funds.” The
cost of the barge-carrying ships has
been estimated at $l2-15 million, and
alternative financing within the intent
of the Commonwealth-States financing
arrangement backstops the approach
to Canberra.
There was a tentative move over-
stated by Opposition Leader John
Tonkin in Parliament by Thotnas
Nationwide Transport to take over the
State ships; but required safeguards
were not forthcoming for port servicing,
frequency of service, freight rates, and
continuity of employment, so no firm
offer to buy was actually made. Mr.
O’Connor has said freight rates could
be cut as much as 40 percent and a
“significant cut could be made in the
service’s losses.” In fact, the proposal
is so radical that he hopes W.A.’s
loser might even be made profitable.

The Savoy Plaza is one of Melbourne’s most popular hotels,
right at the centre of things. Across the road from the major
interstate rail terminal, a few minutes from the airway
terminals, just a step from the city’s commercial hub and a
leisurely stroll to Collins Street, famed for its shops, restaurants
and theatres.
It has a brand new Convention Centre and everything that
goes to make for well organised, smooth-running conventions,
big or small.
The Savoy offers top class accommodation and round-the-
clock room service seven days a week, with liquor at bottle
shop prices between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. Mondays to Saturdays.
On the spot there’s the exciting atmosphere and superb
entertainment of the Rainbow Room Restaurant and for
something a little more active the Bavarian heartiness of
the Keller.
With all this, no wonder the Savoy Plaza is popular.
A phone call to your nearest Federal Group hotel will bring

INTERNATIONAL
Nixon: the campaign that never was
RICHARD NIXON’S drive for the
White House is rapidly becoming the
campaign that never was.
Following a majestically leisurely
schedule, the candidate drops from the
skies twice a day at some local air-
port, descends like a god from his
Boeing 727 and then, almost lost in
a massive motor cavalcade, is whisked
away to a downtown rally, an appear-
ance in an auditorium, or even (as
happened the other day) to an hour-
long boat cruise. This last type of
option is clearly considered the most
attractive, since there is no question
of Nixon having to say anything at
all.
By six o’clock each night the
shutters are up. The candidate and his
wife retire to their hotel suite, the
travelling Press corps makes deter-
minedly for its lavishly stocked hospi-
tality room, while the local citizenry
settles back to worrying about the com-
ing baseball world series. There can
never have been a less hectic or more
relaxed approach-march to the White
House in American political history.
It is almost as if Mr. Nixon had
already made up his mind that this
year the tide is . with him and that
from now on he needs to do no more
than surf-ride his way to victory in
November.
For a politician whose journey back
has been all the way from the knacker’s
yard, he puts up a performance of
remarkable confidence and elan. Only
his wife, Pat with her tight smile,
her tired eyes and her tense brightness
bears eloquent witness to the fact
that the electoral process claims its
victims just as surely as the political
system produces its victors. But for
Richard Nixon himself it is clear that
1968 has already supplied joy for all
his sorrow, balm for all his wounds.
The crowds, though they slipped a
bit in the border states of Missouri,
Kentucky, and Tennessee in the past
few days, are not just politely cordial:
they are noisily ecstatic. They are also,
as the candidate himself never tires of
pointing out, predominantly young.
They squeal, screa.m, and jump just
as they did eight years ago for the
man Nixon always felt overawed by,
John F. Kennedy.
Today, of course, there is no Ken-
nedy to oppose him: and Richard
Nixon fully accepts that that is one
of the many lucky breaks he has had
this year. (His latest piece of cam-
paign literature, the “Nixon Year Book,”
even goes to the length of including
a genial photograph of himself and
Jack Kennedy smiling together, with
the one-word legend underneath:
“Friends.” But to explain Nixon’s new
popular impact solely in terms of other
men’s mistakes, the year’s events, and
history’s accidents is too easy a way
out.
So is the endless discussion about a
“new Nixon.” The shy, solemn fellow
who has supposedly become a gay,
extrovert Prince Charming. To those
who saw him in 1960, there is nothing
new about Richard Nixon this year,
unless it is the slightly lower jaw and
his suspiciously even teeth flashing
every time he makes what he considers
is a joke. But his way with audiences,
his approach to persuasion, his concept
of leadership are just the same as they
always were.
Even today with an enthusiastic
crowd before him, he relies not on the
Nixon ... the young squeal and scream
power of positive statement but on the
appeal of negative suggestion. “I want
to tell you,” he will begin, giving his
audience an ingratiating smile, “about
the kind of Americans who have been
turning out to our meetings across this
land, just as you have today. They’ve
been the people who haven’t been
breaking the law, who haven’t been
shouting and demonstrating, who
haven’t been violating our American
society.”
His method after that is to skim the
surface of a dozen subjects without
ever properly tackling one. No man in
American public life is more skilful at
skirting hard issues while at the same
time contriving to leave the impression
that he has faced up to all the nation’s
problems and addressed himself to
every one of its difficulties.
The cheers ring out, the applause
volleys forth and maybe that would
always have happened. The difference,
perhaps, is that today in marked
contrast certainly to 1952 when, reveal-
ingly enough, Richard Nixon was
using exactly the same phrase about “a
national housecleaning in Washington”
few seem inclined to point out the
inadequacy of his kind of flesh-creeping
approach to “the law-and-order-issue”
on any judgment a daunting and com-
plex problem.
Possibly the explanation is contained
in something a Nixon-booster said at
the Republican convention at Miami
Beach. “Richard Nixon,” the Governor
of Alaska opined solemnly, “is, I am
convinced, the man to match the mood
of the nation.”
It sounded all right until an irrev-
erent questioner inquired: “Governor,
I’m a bit puzzled. You said that you
thought that Nixon matched the
country’s mood—but doesn’t everyone
agree that the national mood is pretty
depressed and despairing right now
55 •
The rest was lost in a gale of
laughter, but the mirth may well have
been premature. If in four weeks of
successful ' campaigning Nixon has
demonstrated anything, it is that he is
probably justified in believing that
today, far from wanting hard answers
on the problems of peace in Vietnam
or justice at home, the electorate yearns
instead simply for emotional release.
Yet, if that is Nixon’s current
strength, it is also a potential danger
to his prospects. The danger does not
come from Hubert Humphrey, but
from the third man in the race, George
Wallace. In pandering to prejudice,
feeding on fears, and making the flesh
creep, the totally uninhibited extremist
always starts with a solid advantage in
any tiger-riding race. Whatever else he
may aspire to be, Nixon throughout
his career has always tried to play the
man in the middle and there were
clear signs last week that the still-
booming Wallace candidature was
beginning to cause active concern in
the Nixon camp.
So far, Nixon’s tactic has been to
ignore Wallace entirely even to the
point of talking, when he talks about
his opposition at all, solely of “the two
major Party candidates for the Presi-
dency.” There are those around him,
however, who now doubt whether this
course is any longer liable. In the
handsome western city of Denver last
week, one of his aides even went to
the length of confiding: “I tell you, we
never wanted to get into anything with
Wallace, but I just don’t know how
long we can hold out.”
It seems clear that Nixon is


determined to hold out if he can. Asked
last week why he would not engage
in television debates with his two
opponents, Nixon failed entirely to
make the kind of distinction between
Humphrey and Wallace that some of
his staff were yearning to hear. Instead
of making any personal attack on
Wallace or delivering a ringing denun-
ciation of what he was trying to do to
American society, Nixon rested his en-
tire case on the constitutional impor-
tance of maintaining the two-Party
system. He thereby provided further
fuel for Wallace’s brush-fire movement
against “those two big Parties of ours
who think they’ve got a divine right to
carve this nation up.”
It was not an impressive perfor-
mance, and it .may even have been the
first visible sign that, despite the regular
recitation of his recent popular
triumphs (“We had an audience of
600,000 in Chicago, 300,000 in San
Francisco, 250,000 in Philadelphia”),
Nixon is now badly worried by
Wallace. What he is seeking to do
has been clear enough from the be-
ginning: the whole tone of his cam-
paign, not least its pervading air of
leisurely ease, has been designed to
create a bandwagon psychology
irresistible to Right-wingers.
The temptation, and his own current
inclination, is plainly to persist in play-
ing out his gamble of simply ignoring
Wallace and pretending he is not there.
But it would be the supreme irony if
eventually the length of Wallace’s
shadow forced Nixon finally to take
a position. This, quite possibly, might
be the making of the .man who still
on balance seems likely to be the next
President of the United States.
SABAH - I
"JUAN-COME-LATELY"
NATIONALISM
THE “Crush Malaysia” signs now out
in Manila, as a result of the Malaysia-
Philippines Sabah crisis, are one of the
signs of how the Filipinos’ “confronta-
tion” has borrowed from Sukarno’s.
The tired hyper-nationalist slogans, the
familiar name-calling, the monumental
over-simplifications, and the atavistic
resort to sticking pins in the enemy
and burning his effigy are once more
widely evident. What is new is the
possibility that these carryings on will
destroy some painstakingly built-up
relationships designed for purposes be-
yond nationalism.
By a curious twist of logic, which
shows that if you are mad enough to
beat a dog even a bent stick will do,
Filipino nationalism in Asian terms
a Juan-come-lately which has been
demanding an end to the “little brown
brother” Relationship with the United
States has now turned on America for
not being sufficiently big brotherly.
When the dust was hurriedly blown off
the Philippine-American defence treaty,
Filipinos found to their chagrin that
Washington had never promised to go
to war “forthwith” to defend the
Philippines.
For that step to be taken a “common
and present” danger must be shown to
exist and agreed on by both sides. But
the Filipinos who demonstrated outside
the American Embassy see the issue
with passionate clarity. Britain has sent
a squadron of modern jets to defend
Sabah for Malaysia. So America must
do likewise for the Philippines.
Naturally, things are .much more
complicated than that. Britain and
America are SEATO partners with the
Philippines, pledged to mutual defence
action against a common enemy. But
the common enemy contemplated by
the South-East Asia Treaty Organisa-
tion was a beast of a different color.
SEATO then may be the first
casualty of the Sabah crisis. The
Philippines has been the most dutiful
South-East Asian member of the
alliance and Filipinos are angry over
Britain’s continued use of Clark air
base as a filling station on the way to
Sabah. But anti-Americanism will be-
come even screechier in Manila than
it used to be in Djakarta. A brother
nursing a sense of betrayal is predict-
ably more venomous.
SABAH- II
MALAYSIA'S BEST
IN THE Philippines it often happens
that laws are made not to be imple-
mented. But the Filipinos’ objections
to the passage of British warships bound
for Operation Coral Sea off Australia
through the Sibutu Passage near
Sabah suggest that they are prepared
to back up their recent Bill asserting
sovereignty over Sabah. For the British,
Sibutu Passage remains an international
waterway. President Marcos is still pri-
vately asking Tunku Abdul Rahman of
Malaysia to tell him what can be done
to lessen the international friction
engendered by the pressure of Filipino
public opinion on the Sabah issue.
There is talk of a summit, or at least
preparatory talks. But these will
founder on the Philippines’ insistence
that its claim must be discussed: the
Malaysians rule out any talk on the
sovereignty of Sabah.
President Marcos floats the idea of
putting the claim on the shelf for the
time being. The Malaysians feel that
enough is enough, and that the Philip-
pines must choose whether internal or
international reality is to take prece-
dence. The effect of the Western Powers
shutting their eyes and hoping the dis-
pute will go away is that the Filipinos
will continue to put the demands of
internal politicking first. So the pros-
pect is of a long and increasingly
bitter dispute, with Sabah becoming the
Kashmir of South-East Asia.
The dispute has effectively silenced
those in east Malaysia Sarawak and
Sabah—who would like to say goodbye
to the Malaysians, and those Malaysians
who would like to say goodbye to the
east. President Marcos has possibly done
more to help Malaysia’s ruling Alliance
Party get itself re-elected next year than
he has done for himself.
VIETNAM
SWEATY OPTIMISM
FAILURE by the Viet Cong to deliver
a third attack against Saigon has done
wonders for the spirits of American and
South Vietnamese officials in Saigon.
Their feeling now seems to be that
while the Communists have shown the
worst they can do, Saigon can only get
stronger.
There is much in the military situ-
ation that appears to justify this opti-
mism. All the signs are that Hanoi and
the Viet Cong still do want to launch
new attacks on the cities, above all,.
Saigon, since these are an essential part
of General Giap’s scheme, and to aban-
don them would be to admit that the
“decisive victories” promised for this
year are no longer possible.
The repeated failure of Viet Cong
attacks to come to anything a move
on Saigon was expected on September
1 has persuaded even the most
pessimistic that the Viet Cong simply
cannot get through the new defence
system put up around Saigon.
The'Saigon Government has certainly
gained kudos for its success in keeping
the Viet Cong tiger well away from
the city’s gates. The Saigonese are defin-
itely less nervy about the chance of
another attack than they were three
months ago. Nonetheless, the Viet Cong

tiger is still very much alive. The
Americans estimate that the North Viet-
namese and Viet Cong have 2000 more
troops in the Third Corps area than
they did at the beginning of the year.
If militarily the situation looks like
a stalemate, it is far from being so
politically and in this sense the official
optimism in Saigon is less justified.
For politics in Vietnam now mean one
thing peace. And the Viet Cong’s
peace strategy has all along been
aimed, just like their military strategy,
at weakening the Saigon Government.
President Thieu’s problem is first
to show that he personally is not an
obstacle to peace, and second that he
is the right leader for a peace-time
South Vietnam involved in some form
of political competition against the
Viet Cong. In spite of vigorous, and to
a large extent well-founded American
assertions that the Thieu regime is the
best and most efficient this country
has had since the early years under
President Diem, Thieu has not yet con-
vinced an overwhelming majority of
his own countrymen on these two
points
It is ill is which explains the signifi-
cant t< i-iI.» of recent weeks over the
possible return to Saigon, of General
Duong Van Minh, hero of the 1963
coup against Diem. Few people look
less threatening than Minh, a typically
easy-going southerner for whom even
his admirers do not claim political or
military brilliance. After four years in
exile in Bangkok, they say, he would
simply like to come home to play
tennis and eat pho, the Vietnamese
noodle soup.
Thieu’s dilemma is whether General
Minh’s popularity would be an asset
or a threat to his regime. For if Minh
really does have no political ambitions
there are plenty of others, including
possibly the Viet Cong, who do have
plans for him.
The real measure of the progress
this Government still has to make is
that, while for the moment it has
little to fear from the advance of
Communist armies toward its capital,
the prospect of a jovial retired general
arriving at Saigon airport can still
make it sweat.
CZECHOSLOVAKIA
THIN ICE UNDER DUBCEK
LAST WEEK WAS a week of dead-
lock in the protracted battle of wills
between the Czechoslovak leaders and
the Russians. The visit of a Czecho-
slovak delegation to Moscow, con-
fidently predicted, has been twice
postponed, apparently at Russian re-
quest. One reason may be continued
Russian hesitation about what to do
next.
Even more important may be dis-
agreements with the Czechs about who
should represent them and what
exactly they should talk about. Russia
may want to insist that the Czech dele-
gation should turn up with specific
proposals on a number of steps which
Party leader Mr. Alexander Dubcek
and his colleagues are not prepared to
take or even, perhaps, to discuss: much
tougher measures to muzzle the
Press; a purge of liberals in the Party
and the Government; an official ad-
mission that there were counter-
revolutionaries in Czechoslovakia before
August 21, who .must be liquidated; a
postponement of federalisation plans.
But according to the most persistent
rumors it is the Russians’ choosiness
over whom they will talk to —or rather
not talk to that is causing most of
the trouble. In particular, they do not
want Mr. Dubcek. From the Russians’
point of view this is understandable; if
their aim is to get rid of Mr. Dubcek,
who uniquely symbolises Czechoslovak
unity and will to resist, then obviously
they do not want to endorse his leader-
ship by negotiating with him and
this time as a free man in the
Kremlin. But increasing Russian pres-
sure only seems to make the united
front presented by the Svoboda-Dubcek-
Cernik-Smrkovsky quadrumvirate more
solid and impregnable.
Last week Mr. Smrkovsky pointed
out that the Party was much stronger
than before the crisis and that it de-
rived its new strength not from
“bureaucratic and power levers” but
from the “minds and hearts of the
people.” This is the Dubcek team’s
trump card and they are making the
most of it. In these circumstances it
can hardly be easy for the Russians
to find someone else to step into Mr.
Dubcek’s shoes.
So in Czechoslovakia the Russians
are faced with a rebellious Communist
Party which not only seems to be
completely united but also enjoys over-
whelming popular support. Some
observers think they will play the
problem along as quietly as possible
until after the world Communist con-
ference which is due to open in Mos-
cow on November 25 unless they
decide to put the conference off.
The Russians may be hoping that
if they play a waiting game the
Czechoslovak leaders will crack under
the strain. They may hope to use the
continuing presence of the occupation
troops to drive a hard bargain with
the Czechs. Or, of course, they may
lose patience and impose a puppet
regime (if they can) or even an out-
and-out military government. Indeed,
the grave danger implicit in the
Czechoslovak leaders’ gallant perfor-
mance is that they may end by leav-
ing the Russians with no other choice
than that. Mr. Dubcek is skating on
very thin ice and, if he goes through,
not even his undoubted popularity will
save him.
MEXICO
NOT FUN AND GAMES
NEVER WERE THE evils of conser-
vative government better exemplified.
Ripples of dissent against the old guard
of the Partido Revolucionaro Institu-
tional, against the bosses of an aging
political machine, lapped the toes of
President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz when he
took office in December, 1964. By last
w r eek the ripples had grown into a
tidal wave of student anger at the
inflexibility of the Mexican establish-
ment. Four years ago the discontent
might have been pacified with a legis-
lative concession or the resignation of
an unloved political figure. Now the
frustration has become so strong and
so widespread that it not only
threatens the staging of the Olympic
Games, due to start in Mexico on Octo-
ber 12, but may in the long term bring
about upheavals inside Mexico’s ruling
party such have not been seen since
the troubled days of the revolution
some 50 years ago.
The violence in Mexico City last
week, when several people were killed
in battles between riot police, troops,
and students, has its roots in the grad-
ual realisation that the party which is.
the doyen of surviving revolutionary
parties, and whose founders had been
in power when many Bolsheviks were
still in the Tsar’s prisons, had settled
down to a comfortable life with many
of its revolutionary ideals still unful-
filled. Since the early 1930 s the PRI
had been gradually edging toward the
Right, with short intermissions for
revolutionary fervor. Not long after
President Diaz Ordaz took over, the
party machine was given into the hands
of Dr. Lauro Ortega. This administra-
tor appeared quite content with a situ-
ation in which many PRI representa-
tives, particularly in country districts,
were virtually indistinguishable from
the feudal bosses that the revolution
was called into being to annihilate.
It was predictable that the revolt
against the old-style revolutionary
party would come from the students.
Before Dr. Lauro Ortega took over
the party machine, a radical politician,
Sr Carlos Madrazo, had been
challenging the old guard of the party.
Sr Madrazo derived much of his
strength from younger members of
the party. His removal from a central
position of the PRI, and his recent
disappearance from the political
scene, must have gone a long way

Stadium
toward convincing many young people
that the renaissance of the party
needed much more than gentle
pressure.
There is no hope that the trade
unions might try to inject radicalism
into the revolution. The PRI is the
boss of the unions, and union leaders
who object too strongly and
vociferously to the Government’s labor
policy are quickly jailed under the
broad provisions of the laws against
“social dissolution.” Mexico’s peasants,
who have good reason for calling for
change, are organised in handy PRI
packages which render them innocuous
at all levels above that of the parish
council.
The powerhouses of discontent were
inevitably the universities. Violence
first broke out two months ago at the
National University, when a demon-
stration turned into a riot. This famous
autonomous body, whose history goes
back to 1550, is just across the road
from the main Olympic stadium, and
the Government sent in its troops to
occupy the campus on September 19.
So the riots then switched to the In-
stitute Politecnico Nacional, where
battle raged last week. Sr Al-
fonso Corona del Rosal, Governor of
Mexico City, brought in troops and
ordered a crackdown on the students.
Perhaps he was over-anxious for his
city’s good name as host of the
Olympics. The stage is set for further
trouble.
RHODESIA
TIGER PROBLEMS
PLANS FOR AN early meeting
between British Prime Minister Mr.
Wilson and Rhodesian rebel leader
Mr. lan Smith are now being carried
forward in an atmosphere of secrecy
reminiscent of their last encounter,
aboard HMS Tiger in the Mediterran-
ean in December, 1966.
According to an official spokesman,
nothing is happening at the moment
beyond the continued evaluation of the
report brought back a week ago from
Salisbury by Mr. James Bottomley, a
senior official at the Commonwealth
Relations Office.
This thin smoke-screen was appar-
ently intended to prevent the projected
Wilson-Smith meeting being made a
major issue at last week’s Labor Party
conference at Blackpool. Tactically, Mr.
Wilson would undoubtedly wish to get
his talks going with Mr. Smith at a
time to coincide with the Conservative
Party conference, which starts on
October 9. This would serve to switch
attention from the Tories to Mr.
Wilson’s new peace efforts.
Because of the unhappy memories
associated with the Tiger talks
described later by Mr. Smith as a “well-
laid trap” it is unlikely that any new
talks will take place at sea. It is equally
unlikely, however, that they will be
held in South Africa, a suggestion put
forward by its Prime Minister, Mr.
John Vorster.
However, the possibility of a neutral
venue close to South Africa possibly
Swaziland or Malawi cannot be
ruled out.
Mr. Wilson might favor the
South African leader using his influence
with Mr. Smith to prevent a repetition
of what happened on the Tiger when,
toward its close, Mr. Smith calmly
announced that he had no authority
to commit himself to any agreement.
One of Mr. Wilson’s preconditions
for a meeting with Mr. Smith this time
is that the Rhodesian rebel leader will
be empowered to put his personal signa-
ture to anything that might be agreed.
South Africa’s interest in getting a
Rhodesian settlement is dictated largely
by concern over its involvement in
guerilla operations and over sanctions.
It seems fairly certain that the in-
tensive exchanges between London,
Salisbury, and Pretoria in recent weeks
have been largely concerned with get-
ting a draft document prepared in
advance of the talks to narrow down,
as far as possible, the difference be-
tween the two sides.
Both sides have now agreed to use
the Tiger document as the starting
point of their new negotiations
despite the bitter language used by
Mr. Smith when he last rejected it.
The crucial question that still
divides Mr. Wilson and Mr. Smith is
the British insistence on unimpeded
progress toward majority i.e.,
African rule. Mr. Smith has lately
said several times that he does not
contemplate the possibility of African
majority rule in his lifetime or for
the foreseeable future. He has spoken
of it as something that could be dealt
with by his grandchildren.
NEW ZEALAND
"SEA PRODUCTS" SINKS
FISHING has been billed as such a
glowing growth industry in New
Zealand for years that last week’s col-
lapse of the Government-supported
“New Zealand Sea Products” gave a
traumatic shock to more than the
export conscious.
Australia has been the biggest market
of N.Z. seafood exports. Growing
demand, the forthcoming weekly roll-
on, roll-off transtasman shipping service,
and the benefits of devaluation all sup-
ported the belief that the Australian
market offered great prospects for New
Zealand fish. The traditional pastoral
products provide such a large section of
the country’s export earnings that fish’s
one percent of earnings seems small, yet
fishing has been paraded as one of the
saving props of the dependent economy.
“New Zealand Sea Products” was
one of the main ventures in the indus-
try and was created in a mood of
euphoria reserved normally in New
Zealand for coronations. Former Naval
Chief, Sir Peter Phipps, was installed
as Chairman of Directors, 5000 share-
holders invested one million dollars, and
the Development Finance Corporation
and Government came in with emer-
gency capital to bolster the company
in its flagging attempts to. develop.
In the soul-searching accompanying
“Sea Products” entry into receivership
last week, New Zealanders did not
obtain information to show that Gov-
ernment or local private enterprise was
to keep at the attempt to make some-
thing out of the offshore fish resources
that have been good enough to attract
Japanese poachers for years. “Sea Pro-
ducts” emerged as a company that was
undercapitalised, despite the Govern-
ment assistance granted. Two trawlers
were not enough to keep a constant
supply of fish to shore installations.
Researdi is still inadequate.
The industry has not combined small
units to pay the overheads required to
develop its potential.
The alternatives to disarray in the
immediate future include hints of a
German company’s interest in the
assets. This might give the industry a
new chance. The Government seems scr
shocked that it doesn’t know what to
do. Instead of confirming its hostile
attitude to Japanese fishing activities, it
might have to swallow its pride and
step up efforts to obtain Japanese and
other know-how in a big way.


THE WEEK IN AMERICA
THE QUEEN INSULTED?
DID or did not Canadian Prime Minis-
ter Pierre Trudeau say recently he
“didn’t give a damn for the Queen?”
Trudeau denies he said it, but Con-
servatives, including former Prime
Minister John Diefenbaker claim that
he did. Regardless of what Trudeau
said, his known anti-monarchial views
have become something of a political
issue. Omission of the Queen’s name
and the traditional statement of loyalty
to the crowm from the Speech From
the Throne, written by Trudeau, has
inspired questions in the House con-
cerning the Prime Minister’s views on
continuation of Canada’s ties to the
monarchy.
Quebec Province separatists have
proposed a republican form of govern-
ment for Canada, severed from the
British crown.
Trudeau, replying to questions in
the House, said the monarchy would
stay “until the people of Canada” de-
manded a change. The monarchial
government might well be reviewed at
the federal provincial conference he
planned to call late in the year,
Trudeau said. Meanwhile he saw “no
necessity for the Government to have
to parade loyalties publicly every once
in a while.”
Quebeckers view republicanism as a
Trudeau ... a known anti-monarchist
practical step toward decentralisation,
giving their French-speaking province
the powers desired in exchange for
staying in the Canadian federation.
Many English-Canadians seek to sever
existing legal ties to the British Par-
liament, but want to maintain allegiance
to the Queen and the parliamentary
system.
CHASING ZOND-5
STUNG by the Russian feat of sending
Zond-5 around the moon and success-
fully recovering the unmanned space-
craft fro'm the Indian Ocean, Ameri-
Anti-war protesters in Milwaukee last week burnt thousands of draft records seized
from Government premises. Priests were among those arrested. AAP-AP picture
can space officials were suddenly con-
sidering putting three astronauts into
lunar orbit before the year’s end.
Apollo Project engineers at the
manned spacecraft centre in Houston,
Texas, contend such a flight is neces-
sary to give astronauts and ground con-
trollers experience in navigation and
communications at lunar distances
before attempting to land men on the
moon, hopefully by 1970. A manned
orbital flight would also help enhance
American space prestige, which has
been considerably lessened by the latest
Russian achievement.
The Americans have drawn up a
detailed blueprint for Apollo 1, a
flight of three astronauts orbiting the
moon at an altitude of about 70 miles
some time this December. Instead of
simply looping the moon, as Zond-5
did, the American crew would circle it
several times, photographing possible
landing sites and testing effects of lunar
gravity on their spacecraft.
This lunar attempt hinges on the
success of Apollo 7, a manned earth-
orbital flight scheduled for next Friday,
October 11. Apollo 8 would be the first
manned flight launched by the Saturn-
-5 moon rocket and would have more
than enough power to reach lunar orbit.
Zond-5 did not close in enough to
attempt orbiting the moon. Its closest
approach was reported as 1210 miles.
American officials made no secret of
their envy of Russia’s continuing suc-
cess in space achievements. James E.
Webb, who recently announced his resig-
nation as administrator of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration,
called the Soviet moon feat “the most
important demonstration of total space
capability up to now by any nation.”
Webb warned that Russia would retain
its space lead over the U.S. for many
years unless there was a sharp change
in American financial policy regarding
the space effort. Sharp cuts in the
budget for NASA, as well as the 20-
month setback from the Apollo space-
craft fire in January, 1967, have seri-
ously delayed the program for placing
two men on the moon by 1970. Ameri-
cans now fear the Russians will get
there first.
TROUBLE UP AHEAD
LEADERS of the radical New Left,
elated over their success in disturbing
the streets of Chicago during the
Democratic Convention, are now said
to be making plans to sabotage the
Presidential election of November 5.
“Students for a Democratic Society”
and similar militant youth movements
are making elaborate preparations to
“zero in” on key voting precincts in
the big cities which normally produce
an overwhelming vote for the Demo-
cratic candidates. The SDS leaders in-
tend to disrupt the voting by staging
noisy protests, intimidating voters, and
sabotaging voting machines. The New
Left is determined to bring about the
defeat of the Democratic candidate,
Vice-President Hubert Humphrey, in
order to demonstrate the power of the
radical youth movement, which prefers
Senator McCarthy to Humphrey.
Chicago showed they could make an
impact on the American public and
world opinion out of all proportion
to their actual numbers.
Until election day the youthful
radicals are keeping busy on university
campuses, staging protests of various
kinds, and following Humphrey and
other Democratic candidates along the
campaign trail, heckling and booing
speakers, and doing what they can to
disrupt their public .meetings. Massive
protest meetings are scheduled for the
last week of this month, just before the
national election, to co-ordinate with
similar protests in Britain, Japan, and
other countries.
THE BANKRUPT PARTY
THE SERIOUS SPLIT in the Demo-
cratic Party between “custodial” liberals
and “humanistic” liberals had effect-
ively bankrupted the Party, which was
“without a great issue, without a hero,
and without a live constituency.”
This was the conclusion of a study
of the U.S. Congress made by the
National Committee for an Effective
Congress, a non-partisan group.
Liberal Democrats, once highly
unified, have been “torn apart in their
search for the life force of American

politics.” “Custodial” liberals were
defined as classic, orthodox labor
liberals, who defended President John-
son’s policies at home and abroad, and
were “contemptuous of intellectuals
and nonconformists, of those who chal-
lenge the familiar routine of Party
power and main-street morality.”
“Humanistic” liberals were con-
cerned with civil liberties and accepted
protest as an inevitable social force
rather than a breach of law and order.
They have been “restive under Johnson
and his leadership, which they regard
as out of touch with the temper of the
times.”
“Custodial” Democrats almost auto-
matically favored Hubert Humphrey,
the committee found, while the human-
ists preferred the politics of Senator
Eugene McCarthy or the late Robert
Kennedy. The two types, the study
showed, “speak essentially different lan-
guages and do not speak very much
to each other.” This split in Democratic
ranks was a major threat to the Party’s
chances of victory at the polls in
November.
THE NEW HUMAN?
AMERICANS have been anxiously de-
bating the consequences of an awesome
power which seems to be coining within
the reach of scientists the ability
to engineer a whole new genetic en-
vironment for mankind. Their fears
were touched off by a recent inter-
national congress on genetics in Tokyo,
which produced the startling predic-
tion that it might soon be possible to
alter human genetic make-up and even
refashion the course of human evolu-
tion.
Many scientists and observers of the
congress were apprehensively wonder-
ing whether society was ready to accept
the enormous changes possible in the
approaching era of genetic engineering
of human beings.
Scientists themselves had no clear
view of the long-term consequences of
tampering with man’s genetic blue-
print, the New York “Times” pointed
out.
“Headlong advances in understand-
ing the basic molecular 'mechanisms of
heredity over the past two decades have
led geneticists to suggest a wide
variety of practical applications for
their discoveries. They speak seriously,
for example, of programming human
cells with new genetic information, of
pre-selection of sex, of cure of disease
by replacement of defective genes, of
preservation of sperm and egg cells of
superior persons for use long after
death, and even asexual reproduction
of humans—like plants. Frogs have been
reproduced successfully many times by
implanting the nucleus from the cell
of a grown frog into a fertilised egg.
The frog that emerges is identical to
the donor animal. Of course not all
these prospects are just around the
corner, but many scientists feel it
essential that the public begin to deal
now with the complex moral, social,
and legal problems likely to arise.”


De Gaulle’s
Commonwealth
“This is part of France,” de Gaulle bluntly told New Caledonians on his last
visit. This year he met demands for some local autonomy by sending in troops
Typical French interference in African
affairs was the dispatch of paratroops to
bolster up the unpopular regime of the
late President of Gabon, Leon M’ba
ONE OF General de Gaulle’s most
successful hoaxes has been his ability
to gain the reputation of being an
anti-colonialist, when the facts are
that in many Darts of the world the
French Empire still lives on and in
other parts, although independence
has been granted, the French have
been able successfully to continue a
colonialist’s role, if in “neo-colonial”
form.
For Australians this should have been
obvious enough when the General’s
hydrogen bombs were exploded in
French Polynesia this month. But this
did bring up the question of how much
longer de Gaulle can get away with
the pretence that France’s possessions
in the South Pacific are an integral
part of France, and not really colonies
at all.
Time seems to be running out for
France in the South Pacific. New
Zealand has granted independence to
Cook Island and Samoa. This year
Nauru gained its independence from
Australia. It is recognised that some
time Papua-New Guinea will be inde-
pendent and it is doubtful that the
British will want to hang on to their
possessions in the South-West Pacific.
What then happens to New Cale-
donia, the islands of French Polynesia,
and the New Hebrides (at present
shared with Britain as a condominium)?
France refuses even to discuss inde-
pendence for these colonies, but local
nationalism may defeat de Gaulle’s
highhandedness.
In elections late last year in French
Polynesia, two Parties which cam-
paigned for internal self-government
won 16 of the 30 seats and six other
seats went to independents, some of
whom will probably side with the 16.
And in January this year New Cale-
donia joined French Polynesia in pres-
sure for internal self-government within
the French Republic, when New Cale-
donia’s territorial assembly voted 24
to nine in favor of it.
But the answer in February, from
General Pierre Billotte, then Minister
for Overseas Territories, was a cool
warning: “It must be remembered once
and for all that New Caledonia, despite
its distance from France, is part of
the national territory, and that this
situation will not be brought into
question again.” To reinforce the
point, in April the French sent 300
paratroops to New Caledonia, officially
“to reinforce safety measures in the
South ’Pacific,” but in plainer words
because they feared that demands for
greater autonomy for the island might
turn into violence.
The sudden airlift surprised the
89,000 inhabitants of the island, because
at that time delegations from New
Caledonia and French Polynesia were
in Paris to put their case for a greater
say in their own affairs. The Minister
for Overseas Territories refused even
to see them. When the leader of the
New Caledonian delegation came home
empty-handed he said: “We have the
impression that we are the leftovers
of decolonisation, and simply for
strategic reasons.”
The strategic reason is obvious
enough. New Caledonia is almost
solidly composed of nickel-bearing ore
and other valuable minerals. Mining
began there in 1875, shipping enormous
quantities of nickel and chrome matte
to France. Gold, silver, lead, copper,
and mercury were found in quantity
and there are large deposits of coal,
iron, manganese, and cobalt. Today,
New Caledonia is the world’s third
biggest source of nickel, after Canada
and the Soviet.
It has been French strategy that has
also worsened relations with French
Polynesia when, in 1966, France
switched her nuclear test sites from
the Sahara desert to the Mururoa and
Fangatafaufa atolls in Polynesia. In
January Polynesia’s territorial assembly
asked France to appoint a six-man
international commission to “control
radioactive pollution and its fallout”
from this year’s tests. The French
refused. The assembly also asked that
six atomic scientists three from
France (all hostile to the tests) and one
each from the United States, New
Zealand, and Japan be allowed to
observe the tests. The French again
refused.
In the Americas, French interests
display many of the strengths and
weaknesses of de Gaulle’s Fifth
Republic. To many people he has given
a new pride in being French, yet in the
Caribbean area the French colonial
administration is so archaic that it is
in danger of having to fight another
FLN as it did in Algeria 14 years ago.
Most extraordinary has been de
Gaulle’s chauvinism toward the French
Canadians of Quebec, who have been
singled out as a culturally distinct
people who should be encouraged to
form an independent State, or une
patrie, as the General calls it. Canadians
have not forgotten his use of the Quebec
slogan Vive le Quebec libre when he
visited Montreal last year, after being
the first French Head of State to visit
the only colony France has left in
North America ■ — a group of eight
small islands off the coast of New-
foundland that have now enjoyed 400
years of French rule. And to most
Canadians his later square-off seemed


to compound the offence: “At Mon-
treal, the second French city of the
world, the outburst of liberating pas-
sion was such that France had the
sacred duty to reply solemnly without
beating about the bush.” Last month
the Canadian Government protested
against the alleged activities of an
alleged French agent in one of the
Canadian provinces.
De Gaulle has shown no correspond-
ing interest in Haiti, another concen-
tration of French-speaking people who
are removed from the influence of
Paris. Freed from French rule by a
slave leader at the beginning of the
19 th century, and under American
occupation from 1915 to 1934, Haiti
kept few links with France except
cultural ones, and the present totalitar-
ian regime of President “Doc” Duvalier
has no appeal to de Gaulle.
But however fine independence
sounds in Montreal, it has no appeal to
the French in the three French posses-
sions in the Caribbean Martinique,
Guadeloupe, and Cayenne. These are
three overseas departments of France,
and therefore integral parts of the
De Gaulle at the first Pacific atomic
testing in 1966. Recent explosions of
France’s H-bombs defied world-wide
opinion
French nation. Their whole economy
and administration are organised as if
they were 30 miles from Paris and not
3000. The large numbers of French
officials go home to France for their
annual leave and local students attend
universities in Paris and Marseilles.
The white settlers of Cayenne and
the smaller islands of the Guadeloupe
dependencies, descendants of the
original Breton and Norman settlers,
live in remote, patriarchal communities
of fishermen, shipbuilders, and farmers.
But in Fort-de-France, the capital of
Martinique, and Basse-Terre, and
Pointe-a-Pitre, the main towns of
Guadeloupe, the Negro and Creole in-
habitants have a very different attitude
to life.
In May, 1967, there were bloody
riots in Guadeloupe which brought to
the fore a new organisation in the
mainstream of Latin American in-
dependence movements. This is the
Guadeloupe National Organisation
Group (GONG), which sent delegates
to the 1966 Tricontinental Conference
in Havana, where it called for the
“total liberation of Guadeloupe.”
GONG literature captured by the police
shows the influence of Che Guevara.
When members of GONG were
brought to in Paris this year in
the Paris Criminal Court a spectator
echoed the words of de Gaulle by
shouting “Vive la Guadeloupe libre.”
And the Left-wing philosopher Jean-
Paul Sartre gave evidence for the
accused in a show of solidarity which
France had not seen since the Algerian
crisis.
The most damning indictment of
French colonialism, however, came from
a Negro Gaullist Deputy from Guade-
loupe, who said that although he was
not a supporter of the independence
imovement he felt bound to say that
it would thrive in a system founded on
corruption, honor for those who sold
themselves, and persecution for those
who tried to get somewhere by their
own work. “The truth is,” the Deputy
said, “the Government is not master
of the administration in that country.”
But unless drastic reforms of the
administration are introduced soon,, the
anti-Gaullist separatists of Guadeloupe
and Martinique may soon be attracting
more attention than the Gaullist-
inspired separatists of Quebec.
In Africa, the success of de Gaulle’s
facade of “anti-colonialism” was
measured this year when he sent a
battalion of paratroopers to bolster up
the tottering Francois Tombalbaye,
President of Chad. If this had been done
by Britain or Belgium the resulting in-
dignation and allegations of “neo-
colonialism” would have occupied hours
of debate in the Organisation of Africa
Unity or the United Nations. Yet there
was scarcely a murmur of protest against
the French action. Nor was there protest
when French troops were sent in
December to the aid of President Jean-
Bedel Bokassa in the Central African
Republic or earlier to the assistance of
the late President Leon M’ba when
he was having a hard time ruling Gabon.
The extent of French influence in
Africa is often obscured by the variety
of agreements Paris has made. The
island of Reunion, for example, is an
“Overseas Department,” while the
Comoro Islands on the other side of
Madagascar are an “Overseas Terri-
tory,” as is Djibouti—perhaps France’s
most difficult colonial problem, because
of the conflicting claims upon it by its
neighbors, Ethiopia and Somalia.
Apart from the colonies, there are
six independent States which are mem-
bers of the French Community
Chad, the CAR, Congo-Brazzaville,
Gabon, Madagascar, and Senegal.
Another seven States have joined with
these in the French-speaking OCAM
group: Cameroun, Dahomey, Ivory
Coast, Niger, Mauritania, Togo, and
Upper Volta. And France even has
special agreements with radical “out-
siders” like Mali and Algeria, as well
as maintaining close relations with
Morocco and Tunisia.
How does France get away with this
neo-colonialism in Africa? Much of the
secret lies in the very close personal
relationship de Gaulle has with some
of the Francophone leaders who firmly
believe he was the benefactor who gave
them their freedom.
As for the “second generation” of
African Heads of State, mostly military
men who deposed the original leaders
after independence, the main attraction
of France today is hard cash. France
boasts that per head of population she
gives more in aid to her former colonies
than any other country in the world.
There is, too, the military “presence.”
Although Britain was forced to abandon
its “presence” in Africa many years
ago in the face of mounting OAU and
UN opposition, France continues to
maintain her “Force d’lntervention”
garrisoned in Chad, Ivory Coast,
Senegal, Gabon, CAR, and Madagas-
car, and these detachments occasionally
join together for military exercises, as
they did last year in “Operation Alli-
gator” in the Ivory Coast. It is also
estimated that in addition to actual
combat troops in Africa there are more
than 1400 French officers and NCOs
from all services, including gendarmerie,
attached to newly independent States,
mostly as advisers or as training in-
structors.
While the Belgians and the British
left behind them in Africa fairly
populous States, the French left behind
a cluster of what has been termed
“client States,” mostly with popula-
tions of less than two million and
almost all heavily dependent on French
aid. The loyalty of her African ex-
colonies toward France is directly
related to the extent of this aid. Thus,
because President Massemba Debat of
Congo-Brazzaville was too friendly with
the Cubans and the Chinese for
France’s liking, no attempt was made
to avert his recent downfall, and this
was caused largely because of the lack
of French financial support.
Since France’s own upheaval last
May and the severe economies which
have been imposed, the extent of
French aid to Africa is bound to drop,
possibly by as much as ten percent.
French-speaking Africa will certainly
feel the pinch, and the cut in aid is
bound to spell trouble for some of the
more insecure governments. Those
leaders who regard their French con-
nections with pride and make a habit
of spending their “summers” in France
are going to find this becoming more
of an embarrassment when confronted
with the disgruntled rank-and-file
seeking jobs and food.
The resulting dissatisfaction and the
breaking up of the Francophone “club”
may be less effective in keeping
questions and criticism of French neo-
colonialism off the agendas of the OAU
and UN. We are likely to hear more
bitter words spoken against France.
And certainly the Nigerian delegations
at the OAU and UN will lose no
opportunity to lead the chorus of
attacks since France’s recent gestures of
support for Biafra.

THE NEW
NATIONALISM?
By DONALD HORNE
WHEN JOHN GORTON first fluked
the Prime Ministership of Australia at
the beginning of this year someone
asked him how he saw himself as a
successor to Sir Robert Menzies, who
had looked to Britain, and to Harold
Holt, who had looked to the United
States. Mr. Gorton replied that he saw
himself as an Australian.
Although it wasn’t a very good ques-
tion (Sir Robert may have talked more
about Britain, but he did not at any
stage take his eyes off America, and
Mr. Holt was an Asia-looker as much as
a U.S.A.-looker) there is no doubt
that Mr. Gorton gave a good answer —
and that it came naturally to him. He
now seems, in the political manner,
to have become more selfconscious
about his nationalism. His speeches on
his recent tour of development projects,
his “First, I am an Australian” speech
to the Henty electorate council in
Moorabbin, Victoria, a fortnight ago,
and the sensation he caused last week
by announcing his plan to prevent
foreign control of the MLC are the
beginnings of what is likely to be the
most coherent and determined attempt
of an Australian Prime Minister to
identify himself with a nationalist
spirit since the Welsh-born W. M.
Hughes articulated the Anzac aspira-
tions of Australians in World War I.
If Mr. Gorton continues with this
theme and even if from many points
of view he doesn’t make much of a
job of it this is likely to cause Aus-
tralia to lurch into the kind of debate
about itself that, to its detriment, it
has managed to avoid for something
close to 50 years, and which will almost
certainly have an end different from
any that Mr. Gorton may himself
imagine.
Before guessing at the kind of way
this debate could develop it is neces-
sary to de-Gortonise it. The mere
modus operandi of Mr. Gorton’s inter-
vention in the MLC affair tells us a
lot about him, but nothing about Aus-
tralian nationalism. Mr. Gorton is a
loner who is quick on the trigger. He
has a very considerable respect for his
own ability to make up his mind about
anything and he is rash in action.
In modern politics the more usual
idea is for a shrewd political leader
to plug himself into as much of other
people’s talent and originality as he
can assemble (these are his “factors
of production”) and by this means to
amplify his own talents so that he
becomes larger than life. But Mr. Gor-
ton does not yet have much regard for
the talents that surround him. Although
the head of the administration, he is
still something of a stranger in it, and
distrustful of it, as if he were still a
backbencher, free to criticise. In other
fields in which he has made off-the-cuff
public announcements or private
decisions nothing has happened; things
have gone on as before, because he has
ignored the intractabilities of situations
in making announcements or decisions;
events closed in on him most
obviously in the series of contradicting
definitions of Australian foreign policy
by which he marred the opening of his
Prime Ministership and he got no-
where. But in the case of the MLC he
could make an ad hoc, enforceable
decision just as he could when he
sent a naval patrol boat to keep an eye
on the Russian prawning fleet in the
Gulf of Carpentaria. He now has to
make it clear that his MLC decision
was a single decision and not just a
general policy. But good luck to him,
anyway. There are faults in rashness,
but there are faults in caution and he
has at least started something off. But it
is not his manner of making decisions
that is most important; it is the kind
of concept he is likely to build up,
in his own way, of an Australian nation.
To certain kinds of Australians to
speak of a possible Australian
nationalism is to speak of something that
they distrust or even despise. It has
been an unfashionable idea among
politicians for some time partly be-
cause of the highly romantic theory
that people are always most stirred to
vote on pragmatic issues of easily defin-
able material, self-interest, and partly
because of a wider disability that poli-
ticians share with other parts of the
community: if they were going to speak
of an Australian nation, what would
they have talked about? The rhetoric
of the old rural and mateship nation-
alism collapsed: the idea of ourselves
as a nation of bushwhackers became
demographically unbearable and no one
convincingly retranslated the rhetoric of
mateship into new terms. But nothing
new took its place.
This emptiness reflected among
other things the desire to be “mature.”
Australia was taken to have come of
age to the extent that it ceased to be
like itself and became instead like some
other place a mythical “Overseas.”
The earlier contempt for Australianness
compared with an idealistic view of
Britishness or of Southern Englishness
extended into an aspiration to a vaguely
defined cosmopolitanism.
There was, in addition, a kind of
anti-nationalism, specific or implied,
among intellectuals, sub-intellectuals,
and demi-semi-intellectuals who, at
first hand or fifth hand, were aware of
how nationalism was now supposed to
be seen in Europe it had caused
the war, and so forth. That the Euro-
pean nations continued to be nationalist,
but in different and more acceptable
ways, often escaped the vision of those
who, in trying to imitate European
habits, did not understand what they
were imitating. The point about nation-
alisms is the obvious one that they
can be good or bad. There is nothing
intrinsically good or intrinsically bad in
building up an idea of one’s nation of
which one is proud, and which seems
to provide some characteristic and
familiar framework for aspiration and
action. Whether nationalism is good or
bad depends on the nature of the idea
that one has of the nation: if it is a
good idea, then the nationalism that
expresses it is good; if it is a bad idea,
then the nationalism that expresses it
is bad. But to insist on a non-idea of
the nation, and to have nothing else
to put in its place, is to insist on not.
having a familiar framework for aspira-
tion and action. If carried out literally
this would mean that, as a community,
we lived without hope and without any
sense of whether we should do one thing
rather than another.
Of course, as a nation, we have not
lived like this. Individual humans can-
not survive such a condition without
hope or a feeling of sense they go
mad or die and it seems possible
that communities are in a somewhat
similar position. Our articulated sense
of ourselves as a nation became tenu-
ous, but not fatally so. We didn’t die
of it. We went on acting from some
assumptions about ourselves. Since the
rest of this article is to be a summary
of possible forms that a revised Aus-
tralian nationalism might take, it might
be best to begin by examining what
the assumptions have been that we have
acted on lately.
The first and most significant of these
has been the idea of Watch Australia
Grow that we should get more
people into our nation by immigration
and that we should use more of its
natural resources by development. This

THE OLD NATIONALISM
seems such a self-evident ideal for us
that we do not recognise its compara-
tive uniqueness. One way or the other,
almost every country in the world has
a rhetoric of building up its GNP and
hitting a certain percentage in
economic growth statistics; but this is
different from our particular Austra-
lian ideal of national development,
which is that we should get a bigger
and bigger population and not leave a
resource untapped until we have
become a real bigshot.
At present, Canada and Australia are
the two main examples in the world
of ambition in a nation of small popu-
lation to become a really big one, and
the Canadians, with the ever-present
reality of what they see across their
border, are less florid in their hopes
than we can be. There are no other
modern industrial nations of Australia’s
and Canada’s kind of population size
that would dream of such an ambition,
(This is one of the ways in which Aus-
tralia is significantly different from New
Zealand.)
Very largely, the idea of an expand-
ing Australia is our nationalism. It
certainly makes up the larger and more
concrete part of Mr. Gorton’s rhetoric,
It is true that this sense of expansionism
can have many absurdities and naive-
ties in its expression, but it provides
one of the most bouncy factors in Aus-
tralia: it is a creative drive, releasing
action. How well we go about it is
another question. So is the question of
why we should become bigger, of what
good our greater size could be to our-
selves or to humanity. But without this
particular creative drive what would
Australia be?
It is important to realise how differ-
ent our expansionism is from the GNP
nationalism of most other modern in-
dustrial nations. Because of its peculiar
emphasis on population figures and
land and mineral use, Australia has lag-
ged behind .most of these other nations
in the ideology of economic growth.
It seems to be investment itself that
means more to us than growth. We
have a remarkably high level of in-
vestment, but our ecMiomic growth
figures (once you allow for population
increases) are, overall, not remarkable.
While we talk the language of immedi-
ate material prosperity, our actions are
as much those of nation-building as of
the HP age. We are not as lost in the
stupors of “affluence” as, in our most
critical moments, we think we are. It
might have some good effects if our
politicians took this more into account
when they make speeches. They could
make us see ourselves as being perhaps
a bit more idealistic than we usually
admit.
In terms of technocracy and tech-
nology, in the general league of pros-
perous industrial nations, we are a com-
paratively primitive society. Our present
principal metaphors of growth popu-
lation, irrigation, mining, and quarry-
ing are not those of the technologi-
cal age at all but of the colonial age,
and in our education policy, which is
the greatest single factor in building a
technological society, we are, at least
in terms of quantity, well down the
list among the industrial societies, al-
most at the bottom (thereby distinguish-
ing ourselves remarkably from Canada,
which is near the top). It is here that
the kind of economic nationalism ex-
pressed recently by Mr. Gorton and
also his Minister for National Develop-
ment puts the cart before the horse,
or perhaps puts up a cart without a
horse. If cart equals physical resources
and horse equals human resources, the
first is useless without the second.
What is critical about our future
economic development is not who owns
some hill of iron ore or who runs some
Australian insurance company (which
a few years ago did a notably bad
job of investment anyway, even if it
was Australian-owned). It is whether
or not we have men equipped by their
education to be good technocrats and
technologists and whether the tech-
nicians and other parts of the work-
force who work under them have been
educated up to their potential. If we
haven’t got them our only hope is
foreign management.
The wiser course for an economic
nationalism might be to concentrate
on these essentials. In the short term,
since we haven’t got enough trained
people to go around, two expediences
are available. If we are to encourage
more Australian investment into the
more forward-looking industries, we
may need to import more trained
foreigners to help us run them; at the
same time the Government should con-
sider how it can encourage the entry of
more Australians into those foreign-
owned firms that for the moment ex-


elude Australians. But after a while if
we haven’t got enough Australians good
enough to do the job this becomes mere
blowing against the wind. Our economic
nationalism will be little more than
farmers’ and quarry owners’ boasting
unless it expresses itself in education
policies suitable to the technological
and technocratic age and in government
support (partly through its own spend-
ing, partly indirectly) for the develop-
ment of sound science-based industries
in Australia.
One extraordinary feature of the de-
cline in Australian nationalism has been
in the erosion at least in politicians’
rhetoric of the concept of Australia
as the land of the fair go. Australia
was one of the first countries in the
world in which the underground aspira-
tions toward egalitarianism and frater-
nalism of Europe came above ground
and received continuing, confident ex-
pression. Yet they seem now to have
slipped out of even the Labor Party’s
rhetoric. In social services we are now
nothing much for an immigrant to
write home about; in our social rela-
tions, although we are achieving a re-
markably relaxed and non-deferential
style, our leaders do not know how
to praise us for it, nor most of our
intellectuals how to describe it, or even
to see it; and one no longer hears any-
thing at all from on top about the ideal
of Australia as a land of comradeship
and brotherhood.
When Australian nationalism was
born it was above all else its American-
style belief that here we were establish-
ing a new society of a quality that
would be better than any other in the
world that gave it value. There were
crudities, absurdities, and irrelevancies
in this, but it nevertheless shone through
as a defined hope that could affect
action. Along with the idea of “coming
of age” the idea that men could be
brothers was the principal emotional
value of Anzac Day, our true national
day. It was believed that in the quality
of its life Australia could become a
better nation than any other nation in
the world. Now the best we usually
do is to boast of our mining and
quarrying.
The usual reason given for this de-
cline is that our industrial and commer-
cial growth killed it. But is it dead?
Are there not signs that it continues
to lie in the hearts of many Austra-
lians? What has happened is that the
tongues of Australia’s leaders can no
longer give these old words new mean-
ing. This is the opposite of what
happened in America, where, although
industrial and commercial growth was
of a much higher order of magnitude
than our own, the old aspirations, the
old belief in America as a moral idea,
nevertheless continued to exist in
national rhetoric sometimes, in the
manner of rhetoric, in shabby pretences,
but also as a potential creative force
opening up possibilities of new action.
Mr. Gorton is now said to be con-
sidering a new deal in the social services
and in his speechmaking he has shown
awareness (although he is too vague
about it as yet) that finally minerals
are not enough: that there could be
some kind of society here that would
be better than other people’s. Even in
style he fits a certain “Australian.”
Unfortunately, in his character role as
an Australian, he wears a rather old
hat the Cornstalk improbably arises
from the past and now confronts us in
our Prime Minister. If he wishes to
give some external sense of Australian
distinctiveness he might later consider
extending it beyond his own person to
those symbols the flag, the national
anthem, and so forth in which we
might well follow Canada and provide
something of our own.
But it seems unlikely that Mr. Gorton
or anyone else can successfully fabri-
cate a new idea of the nation if it is
to be no more than Australia confront-
ing its own visage. It is above all the
flukes of Australia’s contrasts in history
and geography a European society
adjoining the societies of South-East
Asia that give us the opportunity
to develop a new sense of nationhood
and a pride in new achievement that
could revive our rhetoric of comrade-
ship, but give it much wider meaning.
Here Mr. Gorton can do either great
good or great harm. For about 20 years
now there has been a growing tendency
in parts of our successive Govern-
ments and elsewhere for Australians
to see a special sense of significance and
even of excitement for themselves in the
opportunities that the conjunctions of
history and geography have provided.
All the External Affairs Ministers have
seen these opportunities (and two of
them talked very well about it, trying
to interest their fellow-countrymen in
new visions). When he became Prime
Minister, Harold Holt also fumbled
toward a new idea of what Australia
might be if it developed new kinds of
with some of the nations of
Asia.
But in Mr. Gorton’s early period
as Prime Minister, history seemed to
march backward. Whether he intended
to do so or not, he appeared parochial
and inclined to be isolationist. At the
same time, within his Party, those who
saw Australia’s relation to Asia as
nothing more than that of a threatened
party wanted to do a complete bunk
back home when American policy
seemed to wobble.
Yet, if we want to be proud of our-
selves, in some important way, what
are our other chances if we withdrew
from those given to us by geography?
The great issues of the immediate
future would seem to be the tensions
of the new technological and techno-
cratic societies, the tensions between
rich nations and poor nations, and the
tensions of the relations between the
races. Australia is not likely to be great
shakes at becoming a notably tech-
nological society. In fact, unless we pull
ourselves up by our bootlaces very
quickly we are likely to be even more
derivative as a technological society
than we have been as an industrial
society. But, by the chance of our
place on the map, we might play a role
in the questions of the rich and poor
nations, and of the relations between
the races that would give us a real
sense of connection with the main-
stream of the future, and which would
wash away those connections with the
past that make up our provincialism,
so that we could have the only true
sense of nationality which comes not
from a sense of becoming like other
nations but of becoming different from
them, and in some ways better than
them. It is the confidence of having
one’s own sense of excellence. The
alternative is grisly: a rather second-
rate European-type society cutting itself
off from its environment and from the
mainstreams of the age, trying to keep
its spirits up by boasting about its
material success when even that, in
comparative terms, might cease to be
worth boasting about.
Take four examples: treatment of the
Aborigines, present immigration policies,
economic assistance to poor countries,
and Australian policy in Vietnam.
Although the question of Aborigines is
difficult, nevertheless, compared with
the nations which have serious racial
tension, in magnitude Australia’s prob-
lem is comparatively trifling. Generous,
imaginative, subtle, and intelligent
policies, if quickly developed and if
properly articulated so that our political
leaders made us interested in the ques-
tion, could give us a proud sense of
contribution to the future. The same
feeling could come from a redefinition
of immigration policy even if, to begin
with, we went no further than the
recent Canadian reforms. (Surely what
Canada can survive is not going to rend
Australia asunder.) In economic assist-
ance to poor countries, if we put up our
ante, concentrated resources on
our neighbors and put a lot of clever
people together to think about what we
were'doing, we might again contribute
something to the world’s expertness
ajd to its goodness as well. We were
already doing this in South Vietnam.
The policy of the Australian Task
Force was both more humane and more
effective than the overall American
policy in South Vietnam. But our
Government did not boast about this
enough, or put extra resources into it
and now it is being dissipated.
There is a great emptiness, a great
yearning in Australians for new style
in political leadership. The endless dis-
cussion about how our politicians go on
television goes beyond celebrity-craving:
it reflects a desire by people to see in
their leaders some idealisation of some
good, new, and interesting thing that
Australians might become. It is as actors,
as dramatisers of issues and views of
life, that political leaders can some times
have their most lasting effects, casting
new images of potential, new dreams
that can be more lastingly effective than
Acts of Parliament and administrative
decisions. It is in this sense of using
the idea of the nation as an ideal of
the good that nationalism can have
an effect that is noble and liberating.
But for Australia much of that sense
of nationalism may now have to be
found by actions outside Australia itself.

By PETER COLEMAN
THE KEY to the current State-
Federal dispute is soon enough out-
lined and the absurdity of it, the
ease with which it could be settled
easily made apparent: in the stage of
Australian history since World War 11,
the public has plainly come to expect
further, better, and costlier Government
services (schools, universities, hospitals,
social amenities from libraries to
sewerage); the State Governments have
the responsibility, the power, the ideas,
the programs to meet these demands;
the country has the money to pay for
them; but the Federal Government col-
lects the money and channels it to
other purposes most of them good:
defence, pensions; some of them ridicu-
lous on any rational scale of priorities:
a telephones’ budget which exceeds the
whole of the allocation to the New
South Wales Budget for building
schools, hospitals, ports, and railways;
or an $8,000,000 library for the 100,000
people of Canberra, while paraplegics
at a major Sydney hospital are hosed
down to keep them cool in summer.
More generally, whatever label we
place on the age we live in an age
of New Frontiers, Rising Expectations,
of Affluence, of Social Reform, of the
emergence of a new white-collar class
whatever it is called, everyone knows
what is involved. The old frontier is
for most people closed down. They will
no longer be fobbed off with speeches
that “This is a new country . . . ,” that
ds, with backward social, educational,
and other Government services that we
just have to put up with. We may be
nostalgic, we may admire the remain-
ing representatives of “less pampered,”
more relaxed days, but the fact is that
people now feel an unchallengeable
right to better and longer schooling
for their children, better hospital
services for their families, better sub-
urban amenities from transport services
to libraries and sewerage. They also
want, outside themselves, the under-
privileged deserted children, orphans,
the intellectually or physically handi-
capped, the old, the Aborigines to be
decently treated.
But the point is that these are all
matters of social reform, and social
reform is predominantly a matter for
State Governments, not for the Federal
Government. Every State has its social
programs, although probably in New
South Wales the “social revolution” is
more advanced than in the less populous
and more relaxed States, and I’ll use
two examples from New South Wales.
The Education Department has a com-
plete program for education from pre-
schools to universities and tertiary
institutes. The Wyndham Scheme and
the new universities are parts of it. But
it is under-financed, and even those
parts which have already been launched
show signs of it teacher shortages in
specialist subjects, library shortages,
building delays. (The Federal Govern-
ment, however, proposes to spend
nearly twice as much on a Canberra
swimming-pool as it contributes to pre-
school teachers’ colleges in N.S.W.
$195,000 as against $100,000.)
The Health Department has a pro-
gram for the complete root-and-branch
reorganisation and upgrading of health
services, going far beyond the
$200,000,000 worth of repairs now
urgently needed to maintain existing
services. It includes the building of new
hospitals and the co-ordinating of the
State’s existing hospitals, ambulance
services, domiciliary services, charities.
When carried out, it will bring general
health services to the level already
reached in psychiatric hospitals. But,
meanwhile, for years in one State hos-
pital thousands of operations annually
have been carried out in a non-sterile
operating theatre, and, in another, one
patient in five picked up an infection
while in the hospital. (The Federal
Government, however, plans to spend
nearly five times as much on a theatre
restaurant in Canberra as it contributes
to emergency housekeeping services in
N.S.W. 557,000 as against $12,000.)
One could mention since they
are i m p or tant State matters the
Child Welfare Department’s plans for
underprivileged children; the Prison
Department’s for rehabilitation of
prisoners; the plans for transport, highl-
ways, ports, dams, farms, power,
migrant centres. (Migrant centres! Can-
berra is getting a public mortuary
costing twice as much as the Federal
contribution to New South Wales-
migrant centres 589,000 as against
$40,000.)

Now the stage is i eached when it must

eminent is short-changing it.
In the welter of statistics there are

$8 million. Right, the N.S.W. Minister for Health, Mr. Jago, visits

Hospital, Sydney
only three main points concerning
taxes, loans, and debts. The Federal
Government does not deny the basic
facts:
(1) In the 1960 s all States have
been getting back less of their income
taxes. In 1960 they got 38 percent
of the income tax collected; now they
get 30 percent 5250,000,000, in
other words, has been diverted to non-
State fields. New South Wales has a
particular complaint: it acknowledges
that Western Australia, which gets back
$2.00 per head for every SI.OO New
South Wales gets, is entitled to a bigger
cut because of its size, its deserts, and
its small population, but New South
Wales even gets less per head than
Victoria, a smaller, more fertile, and
equally industrialised State. In fact,
since the uniform taxation scheme was
introduced in 1942, every State’s per-
centage share of income tax has gone up
regularly except New South Wales’
and Queensland’s: Queensland’s has
fallen approximately one percent, New
South Wales’ ten percent. If all States
have been short-changed, New South
Wales has obviously been treated worst.
Consider the increase in tax reimburse-
ment between 1959-60 and 1967-68: it
increased by $136,000,000, whereas
spending on education alone went up
by $152,000,000 in the same period.
(2) Loan allocations to the States
(mainly for public works) have fallen
as a proportion of national income in
the 19605, and again, while Western
Australia and Tasmania need more per
head than other States, New South
Wales has got the worst deal. Over the
past ten years it has been allocated
$450,000,000 less than Victoria, which
represents the building of a lot of
schools, hospitals, houses, ports, and
dams. New South Wales’ share has
even got worse in recent years: in
1965-66 it received $9 per person less
than Victoria; in 1967-68 it received
$12.40 less, despite special additional
allocations to New South Wales.
(3) At the same time as the Federal
Government has reduced its public debt
(from $3,730,000,000 in 1950 to
$3,600,000,000 in 1968), the States’
debt has risen nearly $6,000,000,000
(from $2,367,000,000 to $8,316,000,000).
Before the States can spend a cent they
have to meet an enortnously increasing
interest payment and capital repay-
ment. (The Federal Government
finances its works from taxes on which
it does not pay interest and which it
does not repay—and even lends some
of this tax money to the States on
interest!)
One important development in the
1960 s has been the expansion of special
grants from the Commonwealth under
section 96 of the Constitution, grants
to the States, which the States must
spend on specific purposes selected by
the Federal Government. These grants
are made on condition that the State
Government either matches the Federal
money or does not reduce its own
expenditure in the chosen field. The
science-laboratories program is a good
example. Provided the State did not
reduce its investment in school science
laboratories, the Federal Government
helped finance the building of labora-
tories in all schools. The States could
not possibly reject this money, but the
result is a network of laboratories with
unused equipment and a shortage of
science teachers, while State money,
which could have been spent on train-
ing and recruiting science teachers or
on the hundred other needs worked out
by the States on a scale of priorities,
was tied up in a policy imposed from
outside without regard to the priorities.
We get laboratories all right, but what
a ridiculous kind of education planning.
What a way to run an education system.
It is particularly ridiculous when, by
simply returning the money to the
States without section 96 strings to it,
it would have gone mainly to labora-
tories but also to other education needs
according to planned and rational
priorities.
Similarly, at the Royal North Shore
Hospital in Sydney, State money has
matched a Federal section 96 grant to
build excellent student quarters, while,
alongside, patients live in squalor: State
money, which on any rational plan of
priorities should have gone to patients,
has been tied down to student buildings.
What a way to run a health service.
This section 96 tying down of the
States, without regard to the plans
based on close knowledge of what
should or should not be done in what
order, is one clue to the whole problem.
The money could be given without
strings and spent more sensibly, but it
seems clear the Federal authorities
insist on central direction, however
wrong-headed. This is the ideological
essence of the current dispute: central-
ism and federalism. Obviously a Liberal
Government is subject to strong federal-
ist pressures. The Liberal Party is a
federalist party and one shudders at
what idiocies of central planning would
have been attempted if there had been
a Federal Labor Government in the
1950 s and 19605. Liberal Party members
are federalists in principle as are many
(one cannot say most) of the Federal
politicians for domestic and even
international reasons: Sir John Cramer,
for example, advocates federation with
New Zealand and emphasies there is
no hope of this ever happening unless
there are strong States in Australia;
otherwise New Zealand just would
never be in it. But Canberra is the
centralist capital, the capital of the
Stateless men, and the Liberal Govern-
ment is becoming increasingly centralist
in temper.
This is apparent in small as well as
big matters. Take the Federal grants
for universities, smaller in New South
Wales than the State Government’s
expenditure, but still of great import-
ance. The three universities in Sydney,
for example, are good universities with
good staff and good administrators.
They know what they want and, given
the money, how to spend it best. But
the Federal authorities override expert
university decisions not only on what
sort of building is needed but down to


such details as the style of carpets, the
width of corridors, the sort of bricks.
But the matter goes beyond this
style of administration of pettifogging
interference. It goes to the heart of the
whole tax system. The States have the
right to re-enter the income-tax field,
but, obviously, they cannot because
Federal authorities exhaust the supply.
The Commonwealth has other sources
of revenue: payroll tax, Customs and
Excise duties. It would be a compara-
tively simple matter as Canada has
shown to reduce its income tax by,
say, ten percent, leaving the States free
to collect that small amount, and, if
necessary, the Commonwealth could
develop its other sources of revenue.
It would still maintain ‘economic direc-
tion of the country. But apparently it
chooses as a matter of policy to raise
its revenue by exhausting the income-
tax field, keeping the States out of it,
and gaining an extra lever of control
over the States. The present income-
tax system is maintained, not for
economic but for political, centralist
reasons. The States, in other words, are
not just up against unsatisfactory
financial formulas but against an
ideology of centralising power and of
weakening the States as a matter of
policy.
For this reason, I believe Mr. Askin
was right to “rock the boat,” however
undesirable a public dispute between
Liberal governments is to him and
any Liberals involved. There have
been dozens of conferences, private
meetings, committees, and speeches.
But nothing has come out of them and
Canberra decisions have continued to
prevail over the decisions of Mel-
bourne, Sydney, Adelaide, and so on.
Mr. Askin was right to sharpen the
issues, because the Liberal Party and
the public prefer government from
Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and the
other capitals to Canberra government,
and by “rocking the boat” he widened
his support.
The problem is common to all Fed-
erations. America is now discussing the
Heller plan for “revenue sharing” to
strengthen the States, but, while inter-
esting enough, its relevance to Australia
is slight because many of the American
States are far weaker than Australian
States, their Governors (Premiers)
being restricted sometimes to one term
and the Public Service being regu-
larly turned over. Many American
States, unlike Australian States, simply
lack any will to govern in a socially
progressive way.
Canada is more relevant to Australia.
After a generation of centralisation in
Ottawa following the maintenance of
its wartime uniform-tax scheme and
a generation of gloomy acceptance of
the inevitability of Ottawa control of
the Provinces (States) the trend
was reversed and since 1962 under the
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements
Act, the Ottawa Government has heavily
reduced its income tax to leave room
for the Provinces to re-enter the field;
each Province now imposes varying
inco’me taxes; each taxpayer still fills
out only one form; and Ottawa still
collects both taxes, returning to each
Province what it has imposed.
In. his speech when introducing the
Act a speech which could well be
studied in full in Canberra (the refer-
ence is Debates of the Canadian House
of Commons, 1960-61, Vol. VII, page
7910) —the Federal Minister of Finance
said: “There can be no question that
in a healthy Federal State in which the
goal should be enlightened co-operation
rather than centralisation, it will be
better for the Provinces to face up to
their responsibilities of levying taxes
for provincial purposes in the tax fields
which were assigned to them in the
Constitution.”
The Canadian system is, in my
opinion, the ideal solution. If conser-
vative Canada, however, is too radical
for Canberra, the alternative is a simple
one of reforming the tax reimbursement
formula to increase the base amount
and to allow for higher growth-rate
element. In terms of a s6£ billion
Federal Budget, the dispute is about a
marginal amount of something in the
order of $100,000,000. This is why I
started by saying the solution is, in
principle, very easily found. The prob-
lem is not in finding the answer but
in overcoming the centralist ideology of
the Federal, authorities.
Meanwhile, the Governments which
administer the most important domes-
tic matters in the country stagnate. The
Stateless Men of Canberra take “a
wider view.” And they do this in the
name of Australia!
The view from
Constitution Avenue
By PETER SAMUEL
IS MR. ASKIN’S conference with other
State Premiers going to be just another
meeting at which they whinge about
their financial problems and blame the
Commonwealth Government, the public
relations being more manageable than
usual because the Commonwealth isn’t
around to put its views? That is the
way it is being judged in Canberra.
It has to be admitted there probably
are short-term political benefits to be
reaped by the Premiers trying to off-
load responsibility for deficiences in
their services by throwing around some
well-prepared • statistics which give
apparent proof of Commonwealth nig-
gardliness. But the story has been re-
peated so often that the time must fast
be approaching when it becomes politi-
cally counter-productive.
If the Sydney meeting is anything
more than a political public-relations
exercise, then people in Canberra will
be very surprised. Maybe they are too
cynical. But there are certain completely
new lines the meeting will have to
follow if it is to progress and make
movement toward alleviating some of
the very real problems which exist.
The Premiers might start by con-
sidering whether the needs of the nation
do not require a larger proportion of
the economy’s resources for the public
sector generally. In the past they have
spoken as if all the Commonwealth has
to do is exercise a bit of care and
moderation in its own spending and
that it will then be able to give them
the money they need. Or else the
States demand some of the Common-
wealth’s tax powers, asking it to vacate
an area of taxation, and somehow make
do without the revenue it is raising
by that taxation. That is the politics
of futility, a bashing of heads against
a wall, making noise, maybe, but no
movement.
The Commonwealth is simply not
going to make any gifts. It doesn’t see
any more fat in its Budget than the
States see in theirs.
Mr. Gorton is ambitious to do much
more in the direction of social welfare
and health. He is also keen on develop-
ment. He will be forced to do some-
thing about defence. And the mainten-
ance of the Coalition depends on hefty
handouts to farmers. He’s getting more
deeply into education all the time.
His Treasury has primary respon-
sibility for steering the economy along
an appropriate path between inflation
and unemployment and of maintaining
a balance in our international
payments. The Commonwealth Govern-
ment is not going to surrender any
significant powers, and the State
Premiers will, one day, have to admit
this as a fact of political life. The
States won’t get anywhere by just
trying to squeeze things out of the
Commonwealth.
There is only going to be movement
toward solving State problems if both

sides in the continuing dispute accept
that the resources of all Governments
may have to be expanded. The propo-
sition can be put in the framework
of a certain easily observable tendency
in the process of economic develop-
ment. The first stage is when top
priority has to go to finding food, a
stage which this country, unlike most,
has never been worried by. Second is
the stage when we buy gadgetry and
accumulate privately owned goods as
top priority. Third is the stage when
priority has shifted toward the services
and the provision of the community
infrastructure. In the fourth stage,
economic development simply becomes
less important as people come to value
leisure more heavily than either goods
or services. <
Australia would seem to be in the
process of shifting into the third phase
where people are beginning to value
services many of which can only be
provided by the Governments more
highly than privately owned goods, and
therefore want resources shifted that
way. The position roughly is that for
the past couple of decades top priority
has been given to acquisition of the
private mechanics of living houses,
cars, the labor-saving household gadgets,
the TV, and so on. Although these
demands will, of course, diversify, it is
arguable that Australians now are pre-
pared to shift priority toward services.
Most now have cars but the roads
aren’t fit for them, they have houses
but not the sewage pipes to take away
their effluent, they can get to a doctor
who is well fitted out but can not get
into a decent hospital. And if there is
one thing everyone wants a great deal
more of it is education. Now, some of
these things can be provided by the
Commonwealth, some by the State Gov-
ernments, others by municipalities. What
would not seem arguable is the fact that
there has to be a general shift of
resources away from individual private
spending toward Government services.
All Governments need an increasing
share of resources, and the problems
cannot be solved principally by attempts
at redistribution between Governments.
Now this suggests that the States
should give up attacking the “formula”
Financial Assistance Grants, or tax reim-
bursement payments as they still like to
call them. A variety of arguments can
be arrayed as to why they should not
and are not likely to be much enlarged.
The formula increases these payments
according to population increase and
the rise in average wages, and in addi-
tion adds a 1.2 percent betterment
factor each year, ensuring that from this
source, at least, the States get an
increasing share of total resources as
measured by GNP. They are already
on a good thing with the financial-
assistance grant and they should stick
to it, and direct their demands else-
where.
The reason they attack here, however,
is historical. The Financial Assistance
Grants, once titled Reimbursement
Grants, were instituted when the Com-
monwealth took income taxation over

A CAESAR FABRlC—Serving Australia Uniformly
from the States, and the Premiers are
trying to get it back at least in
part. But the Commonwealth is now
utterly committed against any return of
income tax, and on good grounds. Per-
sonal income tax is complex and costly
to administer, it is one of the more
unstable taxes, varying considerably be-
tween boom and recession, and it is a
vital element in overall management of
the economy, which must remain a
Federal responsibility.
The States seem to have their eyes
on it because they see it as a great
growth tax, and they quote figures to
show that revenues from it have been
rising at ten percent a year during the
’sixties. But the facts are that this has
been an unusual period and that income
tax in future is not likely to be nearly
as productive of revenue. Effective
income-tax rates have risen greatly and
there isn’t a great deal of scope for
further rises. Next year it is quite likely
that the Commonwealth will restructure
income-tax schedules so that the rates of
tax on middle-income earners are re-
duced. The Treasurer is very keen on
doing this, and there will be a great
deal of electoral support for such a
move. But this is certain to take a lot
of the annual growth potential out of
the tax. The point is that Australia has
got to the stage where personal-income
taxation hits very hard in relation to
other taxes, and like, other countries we
are now being forced to put" the
emphasis on other taxes.
What other taxes? The Common-
wealth itself is probably going to move
in the years ahead increasingly into
general sales taxes as well as hitting
petrol (our taxes here are still much
lower than in most other countries),
cigarettes, and alcohol. It may also
apply some of the burden of social
services through a special system of
compulsory salary deductions.
The most that the States can expect
to get in the way of extra Common-
wealth assistance is a more generous
approach to capital payments. Loan
Council authorisations for works and
housing have been the one area of
Commonwealth-controlled finance in
which the States have a really strong
case. They have been lagging badly be-
hind most other areas: the increase in
the past ten years has only been 74 per-
cent compared to a 120 percent increase
in the Commonwealth Budget and
equivalent increases in most elements of
the States’ finances. With money for
works and housing rising at a similar
rate, the States wouldn’t be in nearly
the trouble they are.
If they cannot realistically expect
more from the Commonwealth than
this, then they have to look to their
own sources of revenue. And here, con-
trary to what has often been claimed,
there is plenty of scope for getting
money. All States now have receipts
taxes and with some adaptation these
can be developed into major sources of
revenue. They can even be made to
become the dominant source of State
revenue.
At present the rate is only one tenth
of one percent. Excluding the element
on wages and salaries, these yield
around $25,000,000 for New South
Wales, $15,000,000 for Victoria, and
so on. At these rates they only hit capi-
tal transactions heavily, and elsewhere
no one is really troubled by them. So
if capital transactions are granted some
form of exemption or special treatment
there is no reason why the rates of
receipts taxes should not be radically
increased. In the United States' it is
not uncommon to have such turnover
taxes at rates of one percent; in West
Germany four percent is the usual
figure. One percent would bring N.S.W.
about $200,000,000, which would be a
huge supplement to its $700,000,000
Budget, an indication of the potential
of the tax. Such a rate would allow
the State Government to abandon a
number of smaller, costly-to-administer
taxes of other kinds.
There is one difficulty with this sort
of tax which is causing European
countries to abandon it. That is its
tendency to artificially encourage
mergers and monopolisation, and to
discriminate against the small firm. The
large firm, which can get its semi-
processed goods from a subsidiary
rather than buy them from outside, is
able to avoid the tax.
But these discriminatory tendencies
only apply when the turnover-tax gets
to a rate of two or three percent. At
any level which is conceivable in Aus-
tralia in the next five years or so, it is
not going to be a worry. Beyond that
it might be necessary to consider
changing to a value-added basis of
assessment, and this might be combined
with a reform of Commonwealth com-
pany taxation.
For some time to come the States
should be able to finance most of their
ordinary requirements by raising
receipts taxes. If they can agree to work
in harmony with one another, and en-
courage the Commonwealth to apply a
similar tax in its own territories, it
should not be too onerous politically.
Otherwise, individual States do have
grounds for arguing that they don’t get
the treatment they deserve on redistri-
butional grounds. New South Wales at
present has a good case in relation to
Victoria. Its per capita receipts from
the Commonwealth are slightly lower
than Victoria’s, when, on every criterion
which can be thought of, they should
be higher; the State’s per capita income
is slightly lower, so on grounds of
redistributional justice it should do
better, its urban services are more ex-
pensive to construct, so the provision of
equivalent services is bound to cost
more, its area is larger and, therefore,
more expensive to service. Similarly,
Queensland has an excellent case for
getting some of the money going to
Western Australia.
The sort of deal the State Premiers
should be trying to work among them-
selves is one which ensures that N.S.W.
and Queensland get more from the
Commonwealth without Victoria and
Western Australia suffering.


Assignment for a company of uncommon enterprise:
Speed production
of specialty
steels.
Increasing specialty steel production
five-fold within the limitations of a forty
year old plant, hemmed in from further
land acquisition: that was the problem
Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation faced
in the river town of Natrona, Pennsylvania.
They assigned Dravo the task of building
a melt shop complex under these circum-
stances.
The plant is now in operation producing
high-grade specialty steels. The facility
includes a large hot blast cupola and two
basic oxygen furnaces that convert a con-
tinuous flow of molten iron into high-grade
steel.
Dravo not only built the multi-million
dollar melt shop and installed all the
equipment, but also designed and fabri-
cated the cupola, its two holding ladles
and scrap charger. Dravo also designed
and built a river dock to serve the plant.
Dravo’s services to the steel industry
also include engineering and construction
of continuous casting facilities, circulating
flow vacuum degassing systems, lime
calcining plants, and iron ore sintering and
pelletizing plants.

IRASSHAIMASHI
A SHORT STORY BY HAL PORTER
HER NAME is Fumiko.
She stands, as though
immortal or mechanical,
second after second, min-
ute after minute, hour
after hour, day after day,
week after week, fort-
night after fortnight,
month after month, at
the foot of the escalator
in a Tokyo department store. It is her
job to do so. She has been standing in
the one place for one whole year, and
the second year of her standing there,
an elegant and formal ornament, a gim-
mick, is nearly half over: plum blossom
and cherry blossom have come and
gone like whimsical diseases; irises are
on the point of unclenching their arro-
gant fragilities. Although she stands
throughout all the orthodox and christ-
ened seasons, and throughout the
nameless twilight seasons, and is en-
closed, by mandate, like a shop-window
effigy, in the kimono appropriate to
each sequent season, the weather
she stands in is rarely that of the
world beyond the preposterous and
seductive barriers of plateglass, and
almost always its direct opposite.
When, in the blinding squares and
avenues of high summer, the public
pigeons skulk and brood like ex-
hausted mountebanks, and her kimono
is printed with elements imitating
coolness reeds, ripples, the unkempt
hoar-frost foam of waves the depart-
ment store is filled by the exhalations
from its own manufactured North
Pole. Outside, she can see men with-
out coats wading the glare, ice-creams
being openly licked by the shameless,
the tense, and shimmering skin of
hundreds of nylon parasols. She can
see the heat. She does not feel it.
When, midwinter, on the Imperial
Palace moat a block or two away, the
visitor oyster-catchers, the Birds of the
Capital City, wheel and counterwheel
in bickering flotillas through the jigsaw
panes of ice, and the rampart slopes
are deeply manured by snow, and she
is sealed in a kimono sprinkled with
maple leaves of burgundy and carmine,
the department-store climate is as
ardent as Bombay’s.
These perverse interior seasons are
lit by fluorescents as by an unsetting
sun without orbit, focus, or outline. No
warmth comes from it. No cloud flows
across it. It exerts itself from every
direction, and those who tack about
the glittering false distances in search
of unbought objects to buy or leave
unbought do not recognise themselves
in the looking-glass perspectives which
imitate infinity, and do not cast any
shadows. Lest they should consider
thought, a continuous music saturates
the treated air like an inferior scent.
Nowhere, floor mounted above floor, is
there a shaded and empty corner or a
mute and empty pause in which a
feeling can settle, come into being, and
thicken toward shape.
Whatever the weather, within or
without, obverse or reverse, equatorial
or arctic, all weathers her hands are
always gloved one white, two white.
Both of them, fixed like the paws, the
padded pincers, of a mild and mean-
ingless automaton, hold a pad of cloth,
geometric, white. The pad touches,
just, the asphalt-grey of the forever-
ascending endless-belt handrail. There
is a pretence ... or is it true, after all,
in this place of bogus seasons and swind-
ling vistas? . . . that the white pad clip-
ped in the white, white pincers erases
from the sliding asphalt-grey whatever
is left there by the hands brought in
from beyond the plateglass portals
the sweat of timidity or fever or lust,
the grime of money and sloth and
cupidity, the grease of cheap food, the
stickiness of hair-oil or caramels, the
outrageous odor of hotel-lavatory soap
which has just washed off furtive semen,
or the unworldly smudges of blood spilt
without proper permission.
As whoever owns the hands, and
brings them in and, stepping on to the
escalator, sets seraph or demon or
idiot or darling fingers just beyond the
white, white paws and the white pad,
she, Fumiko, whispers, “Irasshaimashi!”
and inclines her head.
“Irasshaimashi!” . . . “Welcome!”
“Welcome!” to children and con-
sumptives, mothers-in-law, and roues,
ex-barons and failed thieves, suicides-
to-be, crooks, snobs, typists, truck-
drivers, gigolos, nuns, university
students, Buddhists, sister-boys, shop-
lifters, anti - vivisectionists, and
murderers, to those who would rather
be other than they are, to those who
will never again be what they were
“Irasshaimashi!”
At the beginning, months and months
and months ago, centuries of. frustra-
tion ago, she had looked into the
hands’ faces, had now and then varied
the position of her own hand, had
moved her lips as she made her greet-
ing, and had thrown away smiles.
Now, no smile ever, and her lips
painted like a waxwork figure’s no
longer need to move as she whispers
her sole salutation. Now her hands are
numb and sapless in their dead gloves.
Now her body is wooden in its succes-
sion of untruthful kimono. Only her
head, its hair clipped and lacquered
immobile, its eyelids always down as
though carved down, its brush-stroke
eyebrows shaved clearcut along their
upper edges, only this marionette head
bends a fraction, lifts a fraction, bends
and lifts on its hinge to make an in-
clination of make-believe courtesy.
Twenty thousand times a day, week
following week, the inclination is per-
formed. Twenty thousand times a day,
month following month, as her head
makes its minimal and exact noddings,
Fumiko is it still really Fumiko?
whispers, “Irasshaimashi!
Irasshaimashi! Irasshai-
mashi! Irasshaimashi! . .
She is one of those
demi-beauties, unsullied
by intelligence or morals,
ravenous, fortified by a
petulantly stubborn will,
who come to bud in the
remotest and least likely
places. From every last corner of the
archipelago, from foetid sties in island
villages reeking of fish-guts and animism,
from sea-picked sand-dune cabins on
littorals scarified by Siberian winds,
from the most decayed shack in ham-
lets rotting away among mountain mists
and ceaselessly dripping hemlocks, from
the loins of basalt-faced mothers and
toil-deformed fathers, from the midst of
sibling broods already caricaturing in
miniature their brutish and weather-
scarred parents, appear these decor-
ative changelings with the skins of
angels and the eyes of princesses, sports
of heredity who not only break the
pattern of centuries of feral homeliness
but, with a hard nervousness and shifty
guile, the tribal patterns of superstition,
duty, and obedience. However primi-
tive and taboo-riddled the community
they are born into like descendants of
fairytale heroines, however squalid the
family nest, however distant from the
terminus of the once-a-week ram-
shackle bus or fractious ferry-steamer
or 1901 steam railway which begins to
connect their outrider birthplace to the
twentieth century and Tokyo, these
present-day goose-girls and dairy-sluts
and cinder-maids succeed in reaching
the city. They reach it, moreover, still
young, absolutely and purposely alone,
and by their own ruthless and mono-
maniac connivings.
In the city they are no longer abnor-
■mal. There, they are commoner than
sparrows and, like sparrows, they are
soon at home in parks and plazas; out-
side pinball parlors and penny arcades,
sleazy cinemas and dubious coffee-
shops; under the rogue-haunted arches
of overhead railways; along the edges of
back-alley gutters; on doorsteps and
street corners. Having levanted as soon
as possible from rural obscurity, and
slipped into the deeper obscurity and
radiant nightmare of Tokyo with no in-
tention other than settling in, of never
returning, they are soon forgotten, and
they no longer remember. No one
misses them except, perhaps, here and
there in the dunghill villages they have
fled from, some pockmarked oaf or
lechery-ridden cripple, someone who,
from behind a bamboo fence or between
the salt-scorched reticulations of a seine
he was 'mending, spied on a flesh-and-
blood goddess. However low in the
scale of things, she was beyond his
touch but still inhabits his dreams as a
divine torment, a rarer animal to touch
and take and sully like a tycoon.
Pallid with hunger, feverishly wide-
awake, exhausted from days of cheapest
travel, their handful of rubbishy posses-
sions bound in a square of colored cloth,
these outback beauties set their feet at


last on the hexagonal paving-stones out-
side Tokyo railway station. In the
obscure moment between obscure past
and obscure future, there they pause.
Terrified but ecstatic before the Great
Wall of din and violent movement they
have arrived at, they draw together all
the filaments of their disarrayed senses
and instincts like animals atavistically
preparing to reconnoitre an unknown
tract. Then, seeking to be lost so that
they can be found, they step from the
honeycomb tiles, they plunge into the
city packs of those who seem to know
they are going somewhere, and move
inexorably in the direction of a some-
where they do not know but will in-
stantly recognise, pimps and all, in the
direction of the anywhere or nowhere
they have elected to finish up at.
The vicissitudes of amazement, be-
wilderment, discomfort, and humiliation
they must undergo in the first week or
two are forgotten as they occur. No
rebuff or distress can do more than
faintly and momentarily mist over the
surface of a pig-headed satisfaction in
having accomplished the exchange of
one kind of squalor for another. Their
ignorance of what they could be re'mains
untampered with. They have never
been intelligent enough to be innocent,
nor has innocence been permitted them.
It is deliberately, on no information ex-
cept what intuition seems to give them,
that they have chosen their doom, that
they have lied and wrangled and
badgered and jockeyed to have the right
to become the victims they need to be
and desire to be, the beatified prey of
whatever and whomever it is that waits
for them.
As if they had all their lives known
every twist and fork and short-cut on
the sparkling and elaborate map of
the city’s vice, they advance like clair-
voyant sleepwalkers to the very shadow
from which will emerge, his gold tooth
twinkling like a star, his sideburns
steeped in camellia oil, the expected
accosting young gangster with the
world in his delicate and subtle hand.
A-a-a-a-a-h! Here is the porter, as
mortal as poison, at the doorway to
fleshly gaiety and purifying violence.
Hen-brained minor beauties without
the nous to reach anywhere except
nowhere, they have reached their
destination. Unprincipled and lax, not
because of the effect their identifiable
charms of structure have on themselves,
but because of the refraction of the
effect on others, they placidly watch
the porter uncover his brilliant fangs.
There occurs one of those dead-points
in which animals, face to face, com-
municate without a sound. It holds
long enough for two raw truths to be
swopped crudity is, after all, one of
life’s conditions. Then the game of
words is played. Perhaps at first affect-
ing reluctance to be taken in by the
pimp’s suave wheedlings, his pearl-
embroidered entreaties, and ultimate
ferocious clauses of passion, they next
appear to be dumb enough to let them-
selves be taken in, and follow him
through any door he indicates. Moan-
ing “It hurts! It hurts!” in simulated
and flattering pain, they take their first
lessons in the craft of being corrupted,
the craft of being themselves able to
corrupt. Behind this initial door are
other doors and, very soon, manicured,
scented, shampooed, painted, got up in
the glad rags or peeled to the near-
nudity which goes with their new
station, they make their debutante
entrance through one or other of these
doors on to the crowded stage of prosti-
tution—barmaid, cabaret hostess, drink
stewardess, cafe waitress, turkish-bath
attendant, masseuse, inn maid, taxi-
dancer, petty gangster’s rented-out moll,
actress for the cinema bleu, model in
pornographic photographs.
Nothing of this sort has come
Fumiko’s way, none of the exhilarating
cruelties or vile transports she has
intrigued and fought to escape to.
Ungenerous gods, for all her prayers,
deny her pollution and depravity. The
past, like a fallen tree, lies across her
track to freedom.
Far off, in a miserably bleak and
almost inaccessible valley, Fumiko and
her jelly-natured mother and her jelly-
“The Actors, an
Image of the New
Japan,” by Hal
Porter (r.) will be
published next
week by Angus &
Robertson. The
book, along with
several new short
stories, including l
“Irasshaimashi,” resulted from a return
visit by Mr. Porter this year to Japan,
a country he knew well as a teacher to
children of the Occupation Forces
natured and fish-plain sisters made, as
the family ancestors had for several
generations, sunshades of oiled paper.
They were ruled and regimented by
the father, a sardonic and poverty-
stricken miser, harsh in his stinginess,
dangerously taciturn in his sonlessness.
Fumiko’s earliest attempts to cajole
freedom he swatted silently, as one
dealing with silly mosquitoes, they
female, too. Later and more wilful
and forceful pesterings were treated by
chastisement with the bamboo handle
of a sunshade while mother and sisters
squatted by with gelatinous and
inexpressive eyes. Still later, tantrums,
hysteric outbursts, and suicide threats
were mocked, giggled at as though she,
already peculiar in prettiness, were also
harmlessly peculiar in manner. All
this maddened her to visions of run-
ning away but, so enclosing was the
valley, so minute her father’s adminis-
tration of his domestic factory, that,
even had she miraculously got money
from somewhere, flight from the one-
street village itself would have been
nearly impossible, outright flight abso-
lutely so.
At last, and just at the time whet
her dodge of threatened suicide was
turning into an authentic intention to
fill her kimono sleeves with slag and,
thus ballasted, wade into a depthless
local tarn, a letter arrived. It was from
the father’s sister, an aged and childless
widow as miserly as he, who lived alone
in a Tokyo suburb, and was a request,
smelling of barter, that one of his daugh-
ters be let come and live with her.
There was an equivocal hint, which
could be read as meaning that death
was not far off, and a less ambiguous,
purposely tempting insinuation that the
loan of a surplus daughter would, in
death’s good time, be repaid. Avarice,
as much as clan obligation, stirred the
father to action. It was cynical action.
The fact that it was what Fumiko
yearned for was not a consideration. As
the family freak, the moody and least
useful daughter, she was almost immedi-
ately dispatched, like a duty gift of
botched confectionery, on the first of
the prostrating stages of the journey
that would take her from the imprison-
ing ravine and the single street of
sombre hovels which littered its bed, to
the ferro-concrete ravines of Tokyo,
their vertical steeps flashing with acres
of glass, their crests flaring with neons.
Overspent, but elated, Fumiko arrives
at Tokyo railway station. The aunt is
there, less to meet politely a rustic
niece than to collect a form of smart-
money for being old. Fragile, desic-
cated, stooped as a marmoset, the
ancient-seeming woman is animated by
a febrile vitality like that of a sinister
girl’s. Instantly Fumiko sees that her
aunt’s' eyes, slivers of jet behind their
spectacles, contain a union of all sorts
of shrewdnesses and spites, and infran-
gible powers. She senses menace or
madness, but not its nature, and, her
elation jarred, enacts a most vivid
smile for the wizened creature, and
bows low, low, lower.
“Follow!” says the crone, scuttling
off, and ahead, quickly as a spider, not
out and out into the city sparkling, and
roaring beyond the arches of the station
entrance but down and down into the
reverberating and sterile catacombs of
the subway. Fumiko follows.
The aunt’s house in a mean suburb
overhangs a canal from the black slime
of which protrudes a domestic jetsam
of rotting charcoal bales, unravelling
baskets, basins of split plastic, and dead-
beat aluminium kettles. Inside the
house the padded floors are aslant, and
marred by threadbare sores, the
paper-paned shutters torn, and askew,
the walls a deformed mappamondo of
stains and mould. As she enters,
Fumiko smells the familiar umbrella-
makers’ odor of glue and tapioca-
paste from which she has just escaped,
and sees armadas of tiny garish para-
sols set out to dry all over the tilted
floors. The house has become a work-
room where, using the ancestral skills
learnt as a child in the far-off valley
hamlet, the aunt makes miniature
paper parasols. Rich enough, she needs
not do this. She cannot stop herself,
however, from defending her position


in the scheme of things as a money-
grubber.
Fumiko, her face assuming the sly
and factitious composure of a corpse’s,
goes inwardly sullen with rage at a
suspicion that she has been tricked into
becoming her aunt’s assistant, that she
is the victim of an underhand contract
between the skinflint father and his
skinflint sister. Not so. The aunt looks
on her, she very soon learns, largely
as a form of evening recreation, as an
It with which to fill in the hours be-
tween an old woman’s brief and shallow
sleep and the close of a day’s parasol-
making. For the rest Fumiko is ex-
pected to earn her own money, to pay
her way. She has been in Tokyo three
days only when the aunt arranges the
escalator-girl job in the department
store to which, for years, she has sold
the handmade toy sunshades.
Trapped in the remote and forlorn
valley, Fumiko had shapeless and
bizarre dreams and daydreams of
charging the barricades of experience
with head recklessly down and eyelids
serenely lowered, of becomirig a
vivacious and immoral stray with a
mink stole and a cultured-pearl choker,
no fastidious rights, no delicacy of
feeling, and no worm-eaten obligations.
She could never have foreseen herself
snared between two only situations,
both of them so exhausting and time-
eating, and of such a nature, that she
—• who does not regard herself as
having the puppet’s nature is to be-
come a puppet almost overnight.
During the day, day after day, fort-
night after fortnight, month after
month, she performs the incomprehen-
sible duties of the department store
with its fabricated climates and sham
vistas, she stands as though eternal and
clockwork making her minute obei-
sances, daily whispering a hundred
times, a thousand times, ten thousand
times, twenty thousand times, “Iras-
shaimashi!’.’
Having lied the final “Welcome!”
of each day she returns to the house
which trembles on the point of shuff-
ling apart, and slithering like a cascade
of rubbish into the rancid ooze of the
rat-haunted canal. Here, her fatigue
and stupor serve her usefully by blur-
ring the old woman’s attacks, spiteful
attacks disguised as auntly privilege
and the wisdom of old age. Mute all
day among her sour paste-pots and fairy
sunshades the aunt, with someone to
bite, becomes lively and venomous as
a viper. As she hands a bowl of rice
or the smaller part of a fish across the
chasm between them, as she doles out
the beggar’s meal, she more lavishly
dispenses her delicacies of malice, her
gobbets of self-pity.
“Today, my belly aches is.”
“Today, neck aches is.”
“Twelve minutes being late you are.”
“The eel you buy too small is.”
“Lazy creature you are, I think so.”
“Bad-tempered creature you are, I
think so.”
When, mute and numb after a day
of uttering one word, Fumiko remains
so, her tormentor says:
“Cannot hear, please, bigger voice
with.”
She does not really wish to have
Fumiko speak, not yet. She is not tired
of her old woman’s nasty game, not
yet. A retort would interrupt the stim-
ulating exercise of spleen, would break
its flow, would rattle, and infuriate.
Later is, however, different.
Later, when she is prone on the
floor, swaddled in shabby and haem-
orrhaging eiderdowns, and the night of
demons and goblins crowds along
the canal toward the focus of her
sleeplessness, then the earlier silence is
translated into an offence, an insulting
lack of veneration for the old, a crime
against family obligation. To absolve
herself Fumiko must read her aunt to
sleep. Perhaps out of pity which is no
more than a form of contempt, but
mainly to have peace, to have the
black and wicked eyes hidden in their
pods of skin, and the whining voice
cut off so that she herself can sleep,
Fumiko reads the children’s stories that
are the old miser’s sleeping-draught:
“Long ago, long ago, an old man
and an old woman there were. The
old man mountain to, wood-cutting,
went. The old woman river to, clothes-
washing, went. River in a large peach
floating came . . .”
“Long ago, some place in, old man
there was. This old man, right cheek,
big swelling had. One day, the old
man mountain to, wood-cutting, went.
Heavy rain to fall began . . .”
“Long ago, long ago, somewhere, an
old man and an old woman there
were. The old man, every day, bamboo
grove to, bamboo-cutting, went. The
old man, one day, a lovely bamboo-
tree found . . .”
Just as, in the first few weeks at
the foot of the escalator, Fumiko had
been externally animated, a sort of
witlessly smiling and devised human
being, so she had, within herself, been
also animated. This concealed anima-
tion was that of anger, of agitation that
a vision of hurtling headlong into the
pleasures of pollution had been so
abruptly blotted out. In those early
days of constraint, every hour that
kept her from the giddy and carnal
future of her imaginings was one of
bitter resentment and fury. Because she
posted no censor inside herself, behind
the unengraved brow, and figurine
prettiness, behind the commercially
tasteful kimono, she experienced con-
tractions of hate against her aunt, and
the zombie job her aunt had arranged,
against the enervating demands, and
killing austerities of both the pointlessly
palatial department store where the
glittering and narcotic sands of each
day ran out with cruel slowness, and
the unnecessarily sordid canal house
with its always overcast interior through
the murk of which she looked into the
aunt’s eyes, and saw there nothing but
the deadly still coil of a broken spring.
Impaled on her obsession for other
gaudier forms of she con-
ducted semi-crazy dialogues with her-
self, overhauling all the ways the aunt
could be annihilated and, with her, the
necessity for family allegiance.
Even after she had given up any
outward pretence of being other than
a perpetually whispering and ceaselessly
nodding machine, she still prayed,
though less and less anarchically, and
less and less for the death that would
enfranchise her and, with a kink of
reasoning, for the deaths of the old
men and old women of the children’s
stories who, like sharks a waterlogged
raft, seemed to follow her on the
oncoming tide of every night.
Then, suddenly, all this is over. She
has passed through every zone of
fatigue, every tropic of furious despair,
and is in the inner vacuum. Senses,
nerves, fancies, emotions, and hopes,
all are parched beyond resurrection;
the terrible process of acclimatisation
is complete; she stops, all through, like
an overwound clock or an engine taken
over by rust. Next, in the manner of
a body finished with the contortions
and convulsions of drowning, she floats
to the surface. All that remains in her
head, in the foreground of her hearing,
is a kind of insensible and imprisoned
humming. She is as out of feeling as
if she were out of breath, and the winds
that make the ripples on which she
torpidly moves the little distance from
here to there, there to here, are' without
temperature to her.
There, in the house by the canal, she
reads the children’s stories of old men
and old women to the old woman until
the old woman sleeps. Then she, too,
sleeps. Plummeting instantly into the
abyss, her fingers a loose tangle, her
mouth fallen open like an unattended
corpse’s, she sleeps, exhausted, in an
abandonment itself exhausting, on the
floor beside her aunt, in winter under
the same decomposing eiderdowns, in
summer beneath the same musty and
ragged mosquito-net tent around the
boundaries of which, like a fair for
atomies, are set streets and streets of
midget parasols.
Here, at the department store, she
stands, moored, finally processed, irre-
vocably outwitted. She is in no snug,
rowdy dive, moving with mock
-languor, outrageous earrings, and
silver fingernails through the rufous
dusk. Every least shadow in the vast
store has been ferreted out and killed.
Every colorless cell of air is steeped in
music which is less music than a syrup
unceasingly sprayed out as a disinfec-
tant to silence. The seasons continue
to change, and to be contrary: when
the footpath planes and willows are
going bald in the cold, the artificial
indoor trees, rootless and sapless, insen-
sitive to the conservatory warmth, are
rich with plastic leaves, nylon blossom,
and fruit of spun glass. She stands;
her head on its hinge goes down, comes
up, goes down. She is her own dead-
weight, an enigma to herself. Apostasy
has been unavailing. Her nature has
been betrayed by forces too drugging
to her will. On the horizon lie no

scruffy and sensual islands sending up
the pink smoke of invitation; its line is
straight and sharp and clean as a sword
edge. Tired of existence, she is too
immeasurably tired to make any effort
to end that existence. On and on
beyond the two white motionless some-
things that were her hands, the narrow
stream of asphalt-grey bears upwards
its flotsam of other hands. She nods
and nods and nods, and whispers from
the arid nirvana she has reached,
“Irasshaimashi! Irasshaimashi!
Irasshaimashi!”
Nirvana can be breached. Its husk
is no more than skin and bone and
nerves.
One day, in the month when the
irises are beginning to uncrumple, late
in the afternoon, just at closing time,
there occurs a flash of lightning. It is
so enormous and violent a rupture, so
intense and essential, that its incan-
descence gashes through her lids to
the very heart of her eyes. She raises
them to see that the world beyond
the plateglass is transformed, that the
lofty facades outside and opposite are
darkened to deep livid across which
speed berserk assaults of electric blue.
At the moment she lifts her eyes
thunder erupts in appalling detonations,
and it becomes closing time.
At the foot of the now purposeless
escalator, she stirs.
She lifts the white, white pincers and
the attached white pad from the asphalt-
grey. She stops standing. She begins to
move. She walks, smoothly, even grace-
fully, but there is nevertheless a hint
of restriction as though exquisitely
interfitted cogs and ratchets and pivots
controlled movement. She reaches the
staff changing-room where, having come
to her locker, she does not change, does
not remove the gloves, take off and
hang up the kimono, dress herself in
Western fashion for the subway journey
to the house by the canal. She merely,
as if she has read a code in the light-
ning, and received a command from
the thunder, takes her handbag and
leaves the department store. She does
not, as usual, hurry to the subway but
moves somnambulistically in the direc-
tion of anywhere, deeper into the city,
through streets flailed by vast blades of
lightning, volted with some mysterious
and elemental menace, streets above
which, far up, against the sagged-down
draperies of darkness, grotesque
enormities of neon race about, shuttle,
slide up and down like brilliant blinds,
and phosphorescently blaze.
She moves for a long time, not quite
aware that the lightning is meantime
reducing itself to more and more mod-
erate outbursts as regular as pulsebeats,
the thunder modulating its imperial
rantings in a portentous upper obscurity
no longer its own but night’s. She
reaches Shinjuku, that part of Tokyo
until recently known as the Town of
Violence. Behind the skyscrapers of
Shinjuku, the theatres and titanic
cabarets, the cinemas and tea-houses and
revolving tower-top restaurants, behind
plazas where fountains nervously spurt


among the giant ventilator-stacks of an-
other Shinjuku lying underground in
layers, is a cobweb of narrow alleys, the
rookery that is the remains of the Town
of Violence. In the defiles of this Tom
Tiddler’s ground violence is still a ten-
ant. All doors are dangerous; each cor-
ner is peril; those who strip to sleep a
killer’s sleep in the back rooms lay last
and tenderly on the top of their dis-
carded clothes, the cosh or the
strangler’s cord, the petty gangster’s
cleaver, or the honed and beloved
butcher’s knife.
She has just paused, faltering sud-
denly from tiredness, on the pavement
of a flashy square, when the tense
bruise-black belly of the firmament
bursts, and disgorges a cascade of rain,
warm and thick as blood, vertical, offen-
sive, succinct. By luck she has run down
under the shelter of the fantastically
scalloped marquee, rimmed by a triple
row of electric light bulbs, of a Mam-
moth Bar. She retreats to the entrance
of the place and, needing support for
her faintness, sits on the rim of one of
the two ponds of effervescent purple
water there. So that she will not close
her eyes she looks toward the square,
and watches the rain disappear and,
from up or out of the shelter they had
fled to, the others reappear. They begin
again to walk on the surface of the
gorgeous and molten reflections,
through the odors of soaked concrete
and refreshed stone. They are neither
rich nor poor, good nor bad, lovely nor
ugly, magnificent nor paltry. They are
born extras, no more, these elderly
men and women brazenly exposing their
years to the vulgar night and the God
of Thunder, these students miming hap-
piness though suffering the anguish of
being young and temporary, these hus-
bands and wives resigned to tolerating
each other’s imperfections, these lovers
fatigued to silence by too much of each
other’s company.
Pale, mindless, unlit from within, and
no longer under the eccentric impulse
the first charge of lightning had started
up, she sits and watches out of her
stupor of weariness, and does not see
that she is watched.
Presently, choosing its moment, the
voice, light and stammering, says above
her, “Impolite it is, but self-introduc-
tion I make, I Masao am, so I say.”
She does not look up instantly, but
looks up at him, the watcher who has
watched her, and looks away again
from the strange eyes steadily glit-
tering, and the lips divided in a young
man’s smile too beautiful to be trusted.
She is no longer the she who once
longed to be importuned by a young
man of lust and doom, no longer the
she intent on rushing to embrace vile
and superb creatures of her own
creation, creatures without existence
except for such as she. He whom she
would, eighteen months ago, have
greeted with skittish guile and hidden
fervor has arrived too late. The
wicked flash of some promise that she
saw on his face is not for her, now, to
be drawn by. He must go about his
business. He does not, however, despite
her silence, her turned-away eyes, her
insultingly indifferent head with its
lacquered and immobile coiffure, go
about his business. She does not know
how much his business she especially is,
she and her pallor, her moronic pretti-
ness, her end-of-tether lassitude, even
her spotless and unstained kimono that
is not hers, not one white petal of all its
blossoms, not one anther, not one pink
thread of its wide sleeves. She does not
know how much more than much he
needs her, or that the lightning which
mysteriously egged her to sleepwalk
willy-nilly in the direction of the
Mammoth Bar’s purple pool is the
same insane shriek of light which has
started him off toward the same purple
pool from a cul-de-sac in the Town of
Violence.
He does not go. He stands by her
as if mesmerised, smiling down at
her hair, gently stuttering out formal-
ities to which she makes no return.
“Impolite it is, but self-introduction
again I make. I Masao am, so I say.”
“Approach to you having happened,
glad I am.”
“First time I am meeting you, my
regards I pray.”
“Impoliteness, but your name?”
Between these flickering sentences
occur darkish and silent hollows which
should be being filled by the coquet-
tish intrigue and counterfeit emptiness
of her replies, hollows in which she
senses a darker and fanatic wraith to
be doggedly crouched, aping patience
but feverish with impatience, unwill-
ing to accept her muteness and thus
accept loss of face, potent yet aware
of potency’s weakness against her in-
curiosity. She feels each next sentence
being tested, and selected as if it were
a dart, and she a dartboard.
“Dreadful weather is.”
“The weather worse to become, per-
haps.”
“Last month much rain fell.”
“Every day rain only falling, bad
feeling comes.”
“This week’s Monday, umbrella
without, market to I went. On the
way, rain falling, wet I got.”
She has begun not to hear his un-
colored and somehow immasculine re-
marks and, in the hushed depressions
of darkness between one and the other
remark, to forget what he looks like;
his smile bums out; his eyes fade away
like smoke. His voice and he have
nothing to do with her and her torpor,
yet, when he speaks again, she does
hear him.
“Alone you are. Alone I am.”
Alone?
It is her mind using this singular
and unseasoned word which arouses
her a little. She feels him hear her
confessing to have, at last, heard him.
She turns her head, and looks up again.
There are the eyes, wide open, glitter-
ing under the dead-straight, dead-black
dandy’s fringe. There is the unaltered,
dead-steady smile. To her upturned
face, this time he speaks quickly, no
flickering.
“Let us inside sit, then a little let’s
talk.”
Before she can accept or refuse, he
speaks again, touching the knot of his
tie with a little narrow hand on the
smallest finger of which the nail is
long and pointed.
“The throat has got dry. Beer wish-
ing to drink is it?”
It comes to her that she is hungry
and thirsty. She stands and, by the
purple and fizzling pool, hears her own
voice say, “Yes, I don’t mind, please.”
Sooner than immediately, her per-
ception a step to the rear of her in-
tuition, she knows that she has reached
out her hand to touch the key of a
door on which, in faint but not illegible
characters, is marked a word that re-
sembles Danger. His alluring but cor-
rosive smile, his smile at one and the
same time as sad as a saint’s and
gloriously arrogant, flees, for a brevit
of time, abruptly and utterly away, and
the glitter on his eyes goes still at the
knowledge of some future. In this
fleeting interval she sees that his face
is a face with a gate behind it. Behind
the gate? Intuition continues to warn
her that behind the face, behind the
gate, is something faceless, but intuition
has no time to inform the smile
swiftly and skilfully reopens as if an-
nouncing I am the world itself, come
to pay >u a visit, and his voice flies
fluttering out again.
“Together do we go, please?”
“Gladly.” Of their own volition her
dummy lips move to make this correct
and well-behaved word.
“Follow, please.” He speaks like a
husband, a master, a priest unused to
denial. Just as, a century of eighteen
months ago, she had followed her crone
of an aunt darting ahead like a spider,
and down and down into the subway,
so she followed him, he supple and
stealthy in bi-colored shoes and foppish
ashen suit, into the Mammoth Bar.
It is faithfully mammoth, but the
walls and ceiling, and pillars, the sides
and tops of the island bar-counters, the
shelves and doors, the troughs over-
flowing with vermilion artificial roses,
the huge prisms slowly revolving far
up, are one and all of deep pink
looking-glass, and make mere mam-
moth, by a multiplicity of reflections,
and re-reflections, illimitable. This rose-
tinged infinity, with its filigree-backed
and gilded cocktail highchairs, and
looped-up drapings of gold-fringed
crimson satin, and unpausing Musak,
has none of the intimacy and humanity,
none of the lack of privacy of a private
house, no grandfather drooling his way
to death in a corner, no embittered
mother-in-law or unused and hysterical
spinster sister, no stench of mosquito-
repellent or blocked drain, no rubbish
tins, chipped teapots, dripping taps,
crying babies, or stuck drawers. Here,
it is possible not to be human. Here
it is possible, embedded in a melodious
and man-made dawn, in the multifold
privacies of lovers, and the relaxed


solitarinesses of escaped husbands, and
delinquent mothers, and all their sum-
less and rosy reflections, to be private
and solitary.
Thus, private and solitary, they sit
side by side at one of the circular
bars.
“Meeting you glad I am.” This is
polite, and as it should be. It sounds
to her also otherwise, as if glad means
more than manners need it to mean.
“Ah, is that so?” She needs commit
herself no further.
“Beer wishing to drink, is it?”
She is about to say, “Anything all
right is, please.”
She remembers to force herself to
say, “A martini. A chicken sand-
wich.”
Now it is he who says, “Ah, is that
so?” and orders what she wants, and
vodka for himself, or for the faceless
one behind the gate behind his face.
She is not aroused from her lethargy
by chicken sandwiches, by another,
and and another martini, not
refreshed by the comfort of the gilt-
backed chair, not soothed by the sooth-
ing edgelessness of the milieu nor the
flattery of her reflection. Between the
silences which rise, like the fumes of
a narcotic, from a secret store of sil-
ences, he tenders scrupulously chosen
samples of small talk and muffled
blandishments, but, as an experience, he
remains outside her. The fibres of her
nature are too flaccid to absorb even
the mildness of phrase and pettiness of
subject he presents. Even her intuition
cautioning her that watches and waits
is becoming too drugged and irrespon-
sible to be depended upon. He is, per-
haps, skilled in turning woman’s own
weapon, intuition, back on her, and
willing to be patient for a long time,
inerasable and inexorable.
Every now and then, each time he
buys her another drink, he touches her
glass with his, saying, “Excuse, I
Masao am, so I say. Impoliteness, but
your name?”
She stares through the glitter of his
eyes, and the enticing and yet minatory
hindrance of his smile, to the locked
gate behind them, and then looks down,
wordlessly, into the hueless liquid as
though seeking her name there, as
though expecting an answer to “Who
am I? Am I still Fumiko? Who is
she?”
Not once, wearier and more be-
numbed by drink, does she tell her
murderer her name.
It is not until three days later that,
lying as indolently as a cat on the
matting of his room, he reads her name
—at last, at last—in a newspaper.
“Fu-mi-ko,” he says tenderly, and a
number of tears run out of his wide-
open eyes.
At the Mammoth Bar he feels the
moment draw up that he has waited
for, the exact moment that even one
more moment would overturn. She is
still not exhausted enough or drunk
enough not to move inconspicuously to
her execution; she is worn-out and
dazed enough not to defy it. She says
she must leave, and find her way to the
nearest subway. He expresses sadness
at the necessity and a willingness to
guide her.
“Late it is. Station up to, seeing
off, wish to do. Here from walking
ten minutes is.”
“Alone I am,” she says, and then, for
a long time, nothing else.
They stand, they walk, subtracting
their reflections first of all from the
looking-glass bar and, move by move,
from the other flushed surfaces, the
revolving prisms aloft, the ceiling, the
walls, the panels of the pillars. He
walks slowly beside her but never near
enough to be touching her, because she
walks slowly and he never touches
women, not even with his sleeve if he
can help it, never with his cold hands.
They move down the entrance stair-
way away from the rosiness and re-
flections, between the aerated purple
pools, under the scalloped marquee, into
the square, out among the people.
Now, the night stale and manhandled,
the thunder used up, the people crowd
along shoulder to shoulder like beasts
under the specious and needless illum-
inations, the sky-high neons, the sizzling
fluorescents, toward let-down and
chaotic dreams, toward quarrels and
self-pity, toward all the punishments of
a greed for false happiness, for the
sensual and temporal, for cakes and
circuses. They are neither delicate nor
coarse, as they jostle brazenly and
stupidly toward the terminus, neither
gentle nor brutish, faithful nor false,
joyful nor despairing, sane nor mad
but, the disciplines of the day too long
thrown off, their coarseness shows, their
brutishness, falsity, despair, and mad-
ness show. Night is the time when all
that the centuries have taught drains
back into the earth. Day is when people
are caught up in creation and have no
time to see what they are; night is when,
with time on their hands to undo and
destroy, they know what they are.
It does not take long to be out of
sight of the herd which, like a brain-
storm in someone without a brain, mills
about in the more flamboyant avenues
•and plazas that are the facade of the
Town of Violence. Like runaways from
a zoo the revellers surge together, their
mouths opening and shutting to per-
form a desperate laughter, their eyes
metallic with the misery of having to
enjoy themselves, of frittering away
freedom in the exertions of pleasure.
It does not take long for him in his
ashen and flashy suit, and her in the
department store kimono with sprays
of wax-white plum blossom woven
across its pink, to unlink themse'ves, to
leave the incoherent rout behind.
Although she still moves with the robot
slowness and circumspection of some-
one in a trance, one foot after the other,
they are soon out of sight of the hulla-
baloo of neons, and the lurid currents
of rowdies. As though plague-stricken,
the streets become emptier, and empty,
the street-lights farther and farther
apart, dimmer, half-blindfolded. It does
not take long for the ever-narrowing
streets to become dogleg alleys, zigzag-
ging deeper and deeper into a maze of
tortuous passages.
It does not take them long to reach
a cul-de-sac and, at its end, a brick
wall topped with fangs of broken glass.
He has been walking a little in front
of her, not needing to say “Follow!”
for she has followed, and looking back
only now and then to see her, still
in her coma of silence, stepping with
care around puddles, holding up the
kimono a little above her ankles.
When he stops, as he must, at the
soot-grimed brick wall patched with
posters, and injured posters, and stands
beneath the light of the last lamp-post,
and turns to face her, she stops, too,
not far off, with her own air of finality,
the air not of one who has been en-
ticed but of one who has manipulated.
They look at each other across the
funnel of light.
Since their ears are no longer em-
ployed in listening to their own pro-
gress, and now that they are immobile
and quiet, they hear the mean, hissing
whine and irregular blurred drumming
of the streets they have left behind,
and feel the buckled pavement of this
final blind alley vibrate in a mild palsy
of reverberations from the far-off and
preterite.
He has stared smilelessly but, a de-
cision made, opens his eyes more widely
under the immaculate black fringe,
and smiles at her, fully, truthfully,
with an exquisite and evil ardor.
She watches the gate behind the face
swing open, and he who stood beyond
the gate, faceless and nameless, advance
toward her. He, and he, are one, and
she knows now that she knew it always,
and that the annunciation was not 1
am the world itself , come to pay you a
visit but is I am death, come to grant
you exemption. Without haste, he takes
out the knife.
Her lips move a little.
His smile goes. Quickly, lightly, but
not quite kindly, an arm’s length away,
he says, “You something to me wish
to say, is it?”
A smile, the first of her he has seen,
arrives to disorganise the decisive calm
of her face, almost to dimple her drawn
cheeks, a wild smile, and mocking
something to say!
He is near enough, not to touch
radiant filthiness with his narrow little
hand or any part of his own flesh, but
near enough to mutilate and demolish
it without touching. The moment being
nearer, he says softly, advisingly as a
priest:
“Losing your head don’t. Doing that
won’t do.”
He stabs.
She makes an impolite exclamation
or two of shock on her body’s behalf
but, as he continues to stab, and stab,
she attempts, for as long as she can,
to receive the thrusts with courteous
inclinations of her lacquered head, with
whisperings at last sincere of,
“Irasshaimashi! Irasshaimas hi!
Irasshaimashi!”

BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
Toward a dreamland of economic independence
“A few areas where
whatever technologies
the nation shows most
aptitude for may be
developed ...
AT BEST, the Prime Minister’s recent
gestures toward the dreamland of
economic independence could mean the
beginnings of a new and questioning
approach toward economic policy as a
whole and where it should be leading;
a sort of patriotic and instinctive com-
mitment to the international race for a
future stake in a post-industrial society.
At worst, of course, it could all be
nothing more than cheap political hay.
And if such a race is to be joined a
completely new attitude toward foreign
investment is indeed required. To allow
the stuff to wash in as it may is no
longer acceptable; to interfere with the
flow through ill-planned emotional
action could be disastrous; to live with
it and extract the full advantages from
it is presumably the new order of the
day.
Apart from a completely negative
one, there can be no simple approach
to the complex psychological, political,
and economic considerations involved
in a conscious approach to the problems
of foreign investment in Australia.
And Australia’s approach was never
entirely negative. Rather, with its in-
centives of subsidised and protected
industries it has been too permissive,
and some times subservient, in trying to
make an attractive investment prospect
still more attractive. But it has
achieved just that. The question now is
whether and in what areas it is attract-
ive enough to support a more aggressive
and demanding approach toward
would-be investors, what form that
approach should take and how it should
be made.
In the minerals and oil field the huge
amounts of foreign risk capital
attracted here have already delineated
a massive potential which many consi-
der attractive enough. But it is only
too easy after a Bass Strait has been
discovered to decry an over-large oil
subsidy and forget that ten more Bass
Straits would be worth discovering, that
a good deal more foreign capital will be
required to d 6 that, and that there are
a good many other places in the world
where that capital could be applied. It
is only too easy to look at Weipa
bauxite, Hamersley iron, and Bougain-
ville copper and lament that the Aus-
tralian equity holding in CRA is only
15 percent and not the officially
“reasonable” 44 percent (the difference
of an initial sl2 million stake now worth
some SSOO million) or, as far as the
bauxite and iron are concerned, that
neither Kaiser Aluminium nor Kaiser
Steel are interested in any Australian
equity participation at all.
It is better to accept that many
golden investment opportunities have
had to be missed in the name of general
development and that many more will
present themselves on which a firmer
grip could perhaps be taken. And if
the Minister for National Development
turns from defending the massive sub-
sidised profits that an un-Australian
Esso is to reap from the Bass Strait,
to call for more partnership between
foreign and local capital, it is, after all,
only sensible to alter attitudes to
foreign investment as the country de-
velops, but it should be unthinkable to
renege on those companies which have
helped to make that development
•possible.
More partnership along the vague
Fairbairn lines is essentially a psycho-
logical need for a country which is
finding its nationalisim; for more
partnership does not mean more
economic control. And if, for a start,
Mr. Gorton’s rush to the defence of
the MLC against foreign takeover was
completely lacking in political finess
and economic sensibility, it at least
struck the right psychological note
foreign control of his savings is a far
greater affront to the national sensi-
bilities of the man in the street than
foreign control of some mineral deposit
somewhere up North. And with Mr.
•Gorton now fending off all efforts to
make him particularise about any other
foreign investment perils, there can be
little justification for fearing that harm
has been done to Australia’s attractive
overseas image of “political stability
and sound economic management,”
whereas there is something to be said
for letting it be known abroad that
the era of complete Australian per-
missiveness toward foreign investment
is probably drawing to a close.
But as it does so, the need for a
clearer and less-permissive approach
to domestic economic policy becomes
more pressing also. The psychological
and political aspects of living with
large amounts of foreign investment
are indeed important; economic con-
siderations aimed at utilising the
benefits and countering the possible
long-term drawbacks of that invest-
ment are essential. Europe, which has
been gnawing at the bone of American
investment contention for some years,
has shown how complex these economic
considerations can become.
As Britain sees it, stopping American
investment is unthinkable. For a start,
American companies may well be
accounting for only six percent of the
gross national product, but they are
being devastatingly successful in their
export performances, accounting for
no less than 17 percent of Britain’s
manufactured exports. Britain admits
that the rate at which its standard of
living is increasing is not all that could
be desired; it also admits that without
American investment the rate of in-
crease would be far worse. American
productivity records are some 80 per-
cent higher than their British equiva-
lents and have been found to rub off
on to the British employees of Ameri-
can concerns to produce more efficient
workers with fatter pay packets. And,
of course, American companies do not
just import capital but new processes,
new technology, and new management
techniques as well.
The drawbacks of American invest-
ment are also well defined. There is
the everpresent danger that, for
example, a corporate giant in New
York will make a decision on the export
balances of its overseas subsidiaries
which could vitally affect the economic
performance of those countries con-
cerned; there is the very real prospect
of American companies dominating
those areas of UK industry that are
likely to be the mainspring of future
industrial development those involv-
ing the high research costs and high
profits of the high technologies; the
spectre of Mr. Wilson’s “industrial
hegemony” is everpresent.
For the time being the Wilson Gov-
ernment is attempting to promote a
policy aimed at meeting, competing
with, and flourishing alongside Ameri-
can investment there. Industry is being


rationalised, modernised, and regrouped
to produce new entities which are
efficient enough and resourceful enough
to get somewhere near competing.
Government-sponsored “Productivity”
and “Quality and Reliability” cam-
paigns come and go with increasing
effect, as do the squads of British
executives to the seminars of the Har-
vard Business School.
It’s nowhere near the complete solu-
tion, of course. With all the current
huffing and puffing up the roads to
higher and higher technology there is
still a seemingly impossible amount
of ground to be made up before Europe
could shake off the U.S. domination
in computers and sophisticated elec-
tronics, for example. But it’s a refresh-
ingly active and constructive change
from the passive reaction of empty anti-
American rhetoric which was extant
a few years ago.
It was a fair enough start for Mr.
Gorton to throw some mock heroics
in saving an institution like the MLG
from the threat of foreign dominance,
but in arguing that foreign control of
such an institution could be used to
pursue nationally undesirable invest-
ment policies, he invited the inevitable
query as to what had been the desirable
policies pursued by the financial institu-
tions to date. For, after all, it is
through the channels of these institu-
tions that the lion’s share of Australia’s
capital funds flow into the economy.
Unfortunately, such desirable policies
are not at all apparent. The same per-
missiveness which has allowed overseas
capital to flow willy-nilly into the
country has allowed far greater
amounts of domestic capital to find its
way into all manner of unprofitable
and unnecessary corners of the indus-
trial spectrum.
If, as the Government seems to be
indicating, a bright new constructive
attitude toward foreign investment is
being hatched, it is reasonable to expect
that some bright new ideas for domestic
capital investment will be turning up
also, for you cannot have the one with-
out the other. It would, for a start,
be edifying to see the institutions
exploring investment possibilities with
the aid of the latest techniques in cost-
benefit analysis. It would be encourag-
ing to find the Government, narrowing
down the field of investment in general
and concentrating some of the nation’s
relatively meagre resources of man-
power and capital into a few areas
where whatever technologies the nation
shows most aptitude for may be
developed to that high level of excel-
lence which the future will demand.
MEN AND MATTERS
IN A 'WEEK when the Common-
wealth Government promised legisla-
tion to limit the overseas-controlled
shareholdings in Australian life insur-
ance companies (triggered by nominee
buying into MLC) and Mr. Askin
accepted the first life policy from Occi-
dental of California in apparent con-
tradiction of policies, Mr. Charles K.
Reid II arrived in Sydney from the
Life Insurance Agency Management
Association (LIAMA), Connecticut, to
conduct two schools for life offices’
established ’managers. They are to be
held at Terrigal and are the second
series of such courses. Reid was here
seven and a half years ago to conduct
the first.
Reid views American entry here as
motivated by the desire for world-wide
exposure. Although Australian life
offices may be diffident about going
P. E. Hull
Charles K. Reid II
into the American market, they have a
history of overseas operations.
Australia is certainly assurance-
minded, yet, measured by the relation-
ship of assurance to national income,
Australia ranks only eighth in the world
assured as to one year’s income. Canada
is the best-insured nation in the world,
with assurance 1.9 times the national
income. Assurance current in the U.S.
passed the milestone of a trillion dollars
(million million) for 200 million
people, and Americans are insured for
1.6 years’ income.
Reid entered the life insurance busi-
ness in 1935 as an agent with Union
Central Life in Philadelphia, after
attending the evening school for insur-
ance at the University of Pennsylvania.
From 1943 to 1945 he served in the
Army-Air Force Personal Affairs
division, teaching insurance, and later
directed the National Servicemen’s Life
Insurance conservation program. He
trained agents for the Washington
agency of the Lincoln National Life
Insurance Company before joining
LIAMA in 1953 as a consultant. Fie is
now associate director of company
relations.
V His current enthusiasm is tracing the
family tree. Charles K. Reid I, his
grandfather, came to Australia in the
1850 s, married a Miss Annie Monk,
and made money in tea and coffee, in
partnership with a Mr. Brown. They
subsequently went into gold and sheep,
but lost their shirts. Sir George Houston
Reid was his grandfather’s cousin,
premier of N.S.W. in the ’nineties, Aus-
tralia’s fourth prime minister, in 1904-5.
After serving in London as High Com-
missioner, Sir George became a member
of the House of Commons in 1916. His
father was born in Australia, and all
that generation of the family went to
the U.S., via the U.K., except one uncle
of Charles K. Reid 11, who upset family
traditions and all actuarial calculations
by dying of typhoid, the only member
of the family to die under the age of 75.
Reid is filling in the gaps on the
Monk side of the family, and has dis-
covered that Mr. Albert E. Monk, presi-
dent of the ACTU, is a kinsman.
THERE’S USUALLY NO knowing
who the world’s leading wool bodies
will light on to pilot their promotion
activities. A classic case was W. J.
Vines, brought out of the paint industry
to head the International Wool Sec-
retariat seven years ago and still there
after a distinguished reign. Getting
near home (though Mr. Vines himself
■is a Victorian), there is Miss Nan
Sanders, who came over from ICIANZ
ten years ago to take charge of wool
promotion in Australia for the Aus-
tralian Wool Board. This she did suc-
cessfully for a decade until she retired
recently, leaving behind a firmly estab-
lished organisation on which the Wool
Board is now in the process of develop-
ing its expanded commercial director-
ate. To head this it has chosen Mr.
P. E. Hull, who comes straight fro’m
the Sportsgirl-Sportscraft organisation,
one of the country’s most exclusive
makers and marketers of woollen fabrics
and garments.
In his last year at Sportscraft, Hull
has been director of finance and de-
velopment, which is, of course, in the
field to which the Wool Board has for
some time been gearing up its market-
ing structure for a “hard-sell” effort.
Although Mr. Hull is 58, his experience
in development looks, at least on paper,
to be rather limited. The lie to that
could be in Sportscraft rapid growth
in recent years and in the wealth of
commercial experience behind him. He
first joined Sportscraft' in 1951 as a
qualified accountant and chartered
secretary, moved up to be general man-
ager three years later, and, on the death
of the present chairman’s father, in 1959
became joint managing director. Before
all this he had been at Scotch and Mel-
bourne University. During the war he
was with the RAAF, ultimately leading
79 Squadron in New Guinea. J
OIL POLITICS
WHAT PRICE INCENTIVE?
BHP’S MANAGING DIRECTOR, Sir
lan McLennan, was at pains to mini-
mise the significance of his company’s
oil strikes in Bass Strait last week. He
was speaking to the National Press


Club in Canberra and, of course, it is
good business for his firm to present a
gloomy face at present. It wants to
give the Government as little ground
as possible for saying as it has to
the cotton industry recently ■— that
the incentive subsidies have succeeded,
done their job, and are therefore no
longer needed.
Australia is not well-endowed with
energy resources, Sir lan claimed a
strange assertion in view of the fact
that this country is in the world league
as an exporter of coal, has a high
per capita production of electricity,
and will on present prospects be pro-
ducing considerable quantities of oil
and gas. If we are not well-endowed
in energy, which countries are? Western
European countries and Japan, which
import almost all their oil and a good
deal of coal as well? The United States,
which relies heavily on Latin America
and the Middle East for oil? In any
case, we are rapidly moving into the
atomic-energy period, in which scien-
tific and industrial strength rather than
natural endowments of raw materials
will determine the energy potential of
nations.
Esso-BHP, naturally, does not want
the price support they are at present
getting “whittled away.” They have a
strong case for maintenance of prices
and incentive payments until the
existing arrangements have run their
course in 1970, simply because they
are a Government co'mmitment and
Government commitments should be
honored. But beyond that time prices
must be reduced. Sir lan McLennan
stuck to the BHP traditions of secrecy
and silence by refusing point blank to
comment on outside estimates of the
production costs of Bass Strait oil.
The Com'monwealth Treasury has
produced estimates which suggest that
oil will be delivered at the Western-
port refinery having paid piping
costs and royalty charges and a reason-
able 15 percent return on exploration
costs at a cost of around $1.40 or
$1.50. Other independent experts have
put the figure at $l.BO, some at $1.20.
In the absence of any information
from BIIP-Esso, it has to be assumed
that $1.50 is a reasonable estimate.
Now, under present arrangements, they
are due to get $3.50, adding a quality
differential and a 75c incentive payment
to an estimate of the cost of landed
Middle East oil. The Esso-BHP com-
pany can reasonably expect to retain
a considerable proportion of the wind-
fall, but there appears little justification
for forcing local refiners to buy the
local crude at a higher price than
imported crude when it can clearly
compete without any subsidy or price
support at all.
The one thing that everyone can
agree with Sir lan about is his sug-
gestion that the Government should get
on and make its decision as to pricing
policy beyond 1970. Not only producers
and explorers but refiners need to know
what the future holds.
Speculator’s Diary
THOSE BEARS MAY
STAMPEDE, BUT
THE GAME GOES ON
HAD PRUDENCE prevailed, this
speculator would now be a spectator.
Not being made of such stuff, however,
I forsook the temptation to withdraw
from the market in favor of the savings
bank and braced myself to withstand
the stampede of the bears.
It was indeed with great restraint that
I did not embark on a bargain-hunting
spree around the oils board, but a
glance at my portfolio soberly reminded
me that I already had a pretty substan-
tial stake in oils. I had been thinking
of International Oils, the new listing
with some exciting prospects in In-
donesian Timor, yet in the present mar-
ket climate they can now only be des-
cribed as “good medium-term holding.”
Certain things were obvious in the
frothy days of the boom. One was that
it would be easy to float an oil explora-
tion company offering little, initially,
except a taxation deduction. Yet few
acted. Two who did were the entre-
preneurs associated with O’Connell
Corporation, Paul Murray and John
Maguire, and many including myself
also profited from their enterprise in
forming Basin Oil, sold from my port-
folio a couple of weeks back.
In another move a few months ago,
O’Connell Corporation acquired a
majority holding in Ronald J. Murray,
Sydney-based boilermaker and by no
means a spectacular performer over the
past few years. O’Connell Corp. is in
the process of dusting a few of the cob-
webs from its new subsidiary and has
also stated its intention of merging its
own profitable subsidiary in the same
field, Maxitherm Boilers, into the
business of R. J. Murray.
O’Connell paid fifty cents a share for
its majority holding in R. J. Murray,
which has an asset backing per share
of about twice its current market price
of 35 cents. If O’Connell thought fit to
pay fifty cents a share, I think that a
small dabble on my own account 15
cents below this could eventually prove
rewarding to me.
Continuing my search for recovery
stocks, my attention was drawn to
International Resistance. The company
has had a lean time over the past few
years, taking a battering in certain of
its traditional lines. It was embarked
on an extensive reorganisation program
which, inter alia, has involved the sale
of its important capacitator division to
the L. M. Ericsson organisation of
Sweden at a capital profit. Whilst
profit was “substantially lower” in the
half-year to December, and the final
report for the 1967-68 financial year
will be two weeks overdue by the time
it is released this Friday, I decided to
buy 500 shares. Even if the profit is
negligible (although directors in their
report said that, by the date of
the company’s next report, the lost
ground will have been more than
recovered), it won’t worry me as I’m
interested in the present and the future
of the company. With its competent
management in a strong-growth indus-
try, I think I should do well. Besides,
the company is always being mentioned
in takeover rumors.
The MIX Ltd. was my last brave
purchase in the sad week that was.
The Commonwealth Government’s
sledgehammer tactics in stopping a
foreign takeover of this company have
sliced dollars from the market to the
point where the MLC must (perhaps
I should say should) attract the atten-
tion of our local institutions. They
could find it an attractive acquisition
at lower prices than did the overseas
majors. The combination of the MLC
and one of our major trading banks
would be a fascinating one, although
the imaginations of the banks may not
stretch that far. I’m only a speculator.
Of course, ironically speaking, there
are plenty of other functions which
this sudden Prime Ministerial patronage
of the MLC could justifiably fulfil and
some of my Press colleagues have not
been backward in pointing them out.
For instance, the Prime Minister’s
(and MLC’s) newfound enthusiasm for
revealing the beneficial owners of
shares held in life assurance companies
through nominees could quite naturally
extend to shares held by life assurance
companies through nominees in other
companies. After all, sauce for the
goose and all that. A life company
recently used the nominee device to
buy secretly a controlling interest in
another company: our old friend the
MLC did an incognito market opera-
tion to beat Stocks and Holdings for
control of the Australia Hotel!
Having to think of a sale to pay
for my purchases was difficult, but I
settled on Osti, which yielded me a
quick profit of $296
Kitty is now $284.

BRIEFLY
The economy: Following significant nominee and
presumed overseas buying of MLC shares, the Federal
Government proposes to restrict overseas shareholdings
in local life companies; the MLC is regarded as a “special
case,” so the Government’s general attitude to foreign
investment remains unaltered.
The first annual report from the Commissioner of
Trade Practices, Mr. R. M. Bannerman, reveals that ten
“major cases” are receiving intensive study; they cover
about 100 horizontal agreements and a great number of
distribution agreements.
The three months to June saw Australian
listed companies raise $123 million much more
than the $43.4 million obtained in the June quarter of
1967; fixed interest raisings accounted for $87.2 million
and shares for $35.8 million.
The 10 cents in the $1 tax rebate on Commonwealth
bonds is to be abolished; the abolition applies to issues
on or after November 1.
Not unexpectedly, the N.S.W. Budget for 1968-69
included a receipts tax 1 cent in $lO.
The morkets: Price levels on Australian share markets
have gone back to their position of five months ago,
but last week’s, part of the retreat was cataclysmic the
Sydney all-ordinaries index shed a net 39.23 points
and lost 21.51 of these on Friday. In this climate,
individual rises are negligible.
Industrial leaders and the big miners are now taking
a heavy battering. Oil or no, BHP fell $1.55 to hit
$16.95. Mining losses are legion: Western Mining $9.60
(down $2), Great Boulder $18.40 ($3.90), Peko $10.60
($3.35), King Island Scheelite $12.50 (90 cents), CRA
$15.10 ($3.80), CGA $7.35 (45 cents), Mount Isa
$6.80 (42 cents), and so on and so on.
Under its own special crisis, MLC declined by $1.90
to $7.70. York Motors, in a bidding battle,
climbed 49 cents to $1.61.
Equities have drifted back in London after a good
couple of weeks; Australian mining shares could not sustain
a rally on Friday.
Wall Street tended to consolidate toward the close
following seven straight days of blue-chip-led advance.
Companies: The share markets may be crackling
around their ears, yet the actual behaviour of many
companies still looks quite enlivening . . . Some cheer
could properly be taken from Esso-BHP’s plan to produce
25 percent more oil by 1970 than previously forecast,
with the Gippsland field now beginning production early
in 1969; the week also saw Flounder A-l named
as a major gas strike.
Two of the Barriers brought along pleasant surprises:
Broken Hill South pushed earnings up by 33.3 percent in
1967-68, helped by Cobar Mines and Electrolytic
Refining; North Broken Hill did rather better than expected
with only a 9.4 percent earnings decline ... A
dividend cut from 14 to 13 percent was a natural
consequence of E. Z. Industries’ .14 percent profit drop;
there were compensations, however, in an optimistic
reserves report from E. Z.’s lead-zinc prospect at Beltana
(S.A.) . . . Consolidated Gold Fields Australia is not
out of the fight for King Island Scheelite . . . Maker of
diamond drills and drilling equipment Mindrill
suffered a plunge in earnings, from $318,911 to $206,398,
but is holding its 13-£ percent payout.
Masses of excitement surrounded York Motors, which
has now found an anonymous first-come-first-served offer
at $1.40 a share withdrawn, but remains under siege to
Mr. Gordon Barton’s Tjuringa Securities at higher levels;
directors are countering with a one-for-two bonus and
notice of much higher profits . . . Higher tax and devaluation
forced earnings of radiator maker National Consolidated
down slightly; the 20 percent dividend was in no threat.
Shipbuilding was the principal trouble at Evans
Deakin, whose loss turned out to be a thumping $3.3 million;
reorganisation is in train . . . John and Waygood Perry
Engineering perhaps felt some slackness in South
Australia, for earnings came back from $2,295,550 to
$2,192,696 . . . Martin Bright Steels also slipped.
Five stores in South Australia remain as the sole legacy
of the H. G. Palmer crack-up; Eric Anderson (with a
strong Philips Electrical component) has just bought
22 stores . . . On the appliance front as well, Malleys came
along very nicely to send profit $112,543 higher to
$969,105 and to cover 11 percent nearly twice.
Oddly enough, “excess rain” provided farm-equipment
maker Connor Shea with the excuse for the $111,948
profit slide to $287,409, but its 11 percent is also twice
covered . . . Dairy-equipment supplier Bell Bryant’s worry
was the drought and low capital spending, so there’ll
be no 1968 dividend.
A bevy of excellent results as a change . . . Textile complex
Bond’s Industries practically held earnings, and
certainly held the 14 percent payment against a 35.9
percent earning rate . . . Photographic equipment maker
Hanimex jumped profit by 21 percent, paid a full cash 20
percent again, and proposes a one-for-twenty bonus . . .
Motelier TraveLodge’s best year found profit up by
20 percent.
Food processor Scotts Provisions met “intense competition”
but improved its trading position . . . Confectioner Life
Savers wasn’t overcome by the first-half setback as the
year’s earnings finished 25 percent up and are
accompanied by a one-for-five bonus.
STATISTICS


THE LAND
A rearguard action for dairy stability
DAIRYFARMING organisations in
the eastern States have voted solidly
in favor of a series of proposals which
in the broad aim are meant to achieve
two things. One is to give the dairy-
farmer a bigger share of the gross
returns coming into the industry. The
other is to share the returns more
evenly among dairyfarmers and to
enable them to plan their production
more rationally and securely.
The plan seeks the reconstitution of
the Australian Dairy Produce Board
to include seven farmer representatives.
(At present there are only three dairy-
farmers on the Board but eight factory
representatives, despite the fact that
farmer investment in the industry
amounts to $l5OO million, while invest-
ment by factories is not more than
$lOO million.) It recommends the vest-
ing of all milk for manufacturing
and processing in the ADPB when
reconstituted, gives 'the Board the right
to set the price paid to the dairy-
farmer for his milk, and places on the
Board the responsibility of negotiating
and developing overseas markets. Fur-
ther, the Board would allocate a quota
of total sales to each farmer. This, the
authors of the plan suggest, would
provide dairyfarmers with a secure
share in the home market and enable
them to evaluate their costs in relation
to returns from various outlets. They
also contend that this arrangement will
strengthen the home market and 'that
by enabling farmers to plan ahead on
the basis of a stable home market it
will reduce the risk element to a small
section of their total production.
The proposals also seek payment to
farmers on total solids content of milk,
it being considered that underwriting
of the solids non-fat content was desir-
able for casein and skim powder and
that this would mean the eventual
evolution of a total solids payment.
In themselves, these proposals do
little, if anything, to increase the gross
returns likely to come into the industry.
For the most part this is a matter which
the industry is content to leave to the
Australian Dairy Produce Board recon-
stituted on the above lines and to a
series of industry approaches to the
Government these are aimed firstly
to get it to compensate the industry
for devaluation losses in the current
year (as it did for 1967-68), secondly
to get it to restore the $27 million
dairy industry subsidy to its 1957 real
value, and thirdly to raise its guarantee
on the industry’s equalisation agree-
ment.
It may be an oversimplification of
the industry’s position, but on the show-
ing of this latest plan its organisations
are trying rather too much to make up
on the local swings what the industry
is losing on the export roundabouts in
face of an untenable costs situation
and superior competitiveness of overseas
rivals. This isn’t to say that efforts are
not being made in many parts of the
industry to streamline costs and
through the Government’s own Dairy
Industry Rationalisation Plan to weed
out the least efficient producers. Bene-
fits will flow from these in the long run,
but hardly in time to rescue exports,
which are the crux of the immediate
impasse facing the industry. Some
figures from the annual report of the
ADPB underline this, though in
weighing their relative importance it
must be borne in mind that milk
production dropped 6.5 percent in Aus-
tralia in 1967-68 (butter production
fell 14 percent, cheese rose slightly,
and dried skim milk production was
steady) and overall gross returns from
milk production (less subsidy) dropped
by $16.5 million.
The biggest fall in export sales last
year was that of 42.3 percent to $43.4
million in butter, followed by one of
41 percent to $9.2 million in dried skim
milk, and then cheese, whose sales fell
by 9.9 percent to $11.7 million. The
bulk of the reductions are attributed by
the report to the weak state of the
British market, but loss of sales to
Japan is also reported. In a word, the
Board sees no relief from the build-up
of stocks of butter and dried skim milk
overseas and it thinks these would fur-
ther depress export prices, particularly
in the case of butter. The chairman,
Mr. Roberts, poses the thought that
only international agreement can stop
the rot but doesn’t speculate about pos-
sible progress on that front. In the
meantime a percent rise in shipping
freight since revaluation has aggra-
vated the export problem, though some
benefits have accrued from container-
isation.
Trade figures for the first two months
of this financial year show that exports
from dairy products are still declining
after last year’s slump from $114.5
million to $92.9 million. However, the
drop so far this year is not catastrophic
they are down by about $1 million
to $10.5 million for the first two months
(the figures include exports of eggs,
which are not separated in the monthly
trade returns).
While it may simply be a case of
faute de mieux, with the industry’s
position in export markets unalleviated
and price a dominant factor in home
consumption (domestic butter con-
sumption per head rose slightly last
year but that of cheese and dried milk
declined), the plan adopted by the
various farmer organisations involved
smacks rather too strongly of a rear-
guard attempt to get belated stability
for their members and is directed all
too vaguely to the urgencies of the
export situation. It seems content to
leave the whole question of export
competitiveness to the Australian Dairy
Produce Board.
It is true, of course, that under the
plan the Board would be given the
power to set quotas for milk produc-
tion on individual farms and by this
route it would be much easier for it
to control the level of exports than
under present arrangements. But this is
not, it seems, the main motivating idea
behind the quota scheme. In this
respect it fails to face up to the basic
problem not only of the industry’s
own future level of activity but also
of the extent to which 'the rest of the
economy should support it.

NEW LINES IN PESTS
THOSE CONSTANT and vigilant
allies of the man on the land, the
State Departments of Agriculture, have
drawn attention lately to a number of
new worries. Over in the West, the
Department has become concerned
about possible invasion from the East
by red-whiskered bulbuls. Handsome
though these creatures may be, the
Department has warned that they have
been declared vermin under the Act

Sydney area, and their numbers are
increasing around Melbourne. Brought
originally as migrants, many years ago,
from Africa and Asia, they are now
spreading out from the suburbs into the
orchard districts surrounding these
capitals and stealing the fruit. It is
feared that they will become a major
pest, especially in the soft-fruit areas,

and farmers should meet them gun-in-
hand to protect their livelihood.
Back East a plant pathologist in the
Victorian Department of Agriculture
has recognised a potentially disastrous
disease of subterranean clover. The
West, of course, runs on sub, and when
our rich cousins over there get to hear
about this they will surely fall down in
a paroxysm of fright, if their reaction
to a small fruit-eating bird can be
taken as a measure of their neuroticism.
The new disease, dubbed “Red Leaf”
by its discoverer, Mr. A. W. Kellock,
reduces sub clover to a totally unpro-
ductive condition.
The virus strikes in spring and
causes the plants to collapse and rot
on the moist ground. The first signs of
infection are mottling between the
veins of the oldest leaves, which then
turn red at the margins. The symptoms
are all too obvious, but can be easily
confused with those of magnesium
deficiency or, possibly, of Clover Stunt,
another viral disease distinguished five
or six years ago by a CSIRO scientist.
To counter this affliction, the resistant
variety, Howard, was specially bred,
but it is susceptible to the new disease.
On present indications Red Leaf is
very much more destructive than
Clover Stunt, although it does not seem
to attack red or white clover or Hunter
River lucerne.
Neighboring States clamped an em-
bargo on Victorian lucerne hay,
chaff, meal, and seed last year after
Kellock, that bearer of sad tidings,
showed that bacterial wilt, a dreaded
disease of lucerne, previously known
only from overseas reports, was present
in Victoria. Follow - up studies by
Kellock have disclosed that this disease
is still confined to the areas in which
it was first found. Eight infected
lucerne stands have now been located
along the Murray in the vicinity of
Strathmerton. The other focus of in-
fection is near Sale, in East Gippsland.
It seems that under Australian con-
ditions bacterial wilt develops where
there is irrigation, particularly sprink-
ler irrigation. The Victorian Depart-
ment has introduced some resistant
varieties of lucerne that have been bred
in the U.S. Lahontan, Buffalo, and
Caliverde are currently being tested as
possible replacements for the highly sus-
ceptible Hunter River. Plant diseases
are often very dependent upon certain
aspects of the environment, such as
average temperatures and humidity.
With luck, therefore, it may turn out
that Red Leaf cannot readily establish
itself beyond the areas where it has
already developed.
Not to be outdone in this gloomy
business of discovering new plant
diseases the New South Wales Depart-
ment of Agriculture has reported a
condition which it calls “Summer
Death” of beans. As the name implies,
this disorder causes yellowing and
death of certain varieties of beans
after hot weather. A virus is thought
to be responsible and it could be spread
by the same insect, a leafhopper, that
carries Clover Stunt.


INVESTMENT
The Markets
WHO SHALL DECIDE
WHEN ALL THE
PUNDITS DISAGREE?
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS • OIL TABLE
LAST WEEK’S DRASTIC cut in share
prices across Australia brought out all
the experts to have their say. Every
possible reason seemed to be advanced
for the market’s sudden readjustment.
Chartists rushed to point out quite
proudly that the fall had been on the
charts since June (although no chartist
predicted the nature of the fall as early
as that). Reasons given for the 25 per-
cent adjustment in the prices of the
“boom” stocks covered the whole gam-
bit of the share game: “short” selling
by professionals, forced selling to cover
credit call-up, profit-taking, London
selling, and the oft-expressed view that
the gloomy prognostications of BHP
chairman Sir Colin Syme and the
failure of the group to increase its
dividend a fortnight ago created an in-
secure attitude among local investors.
Nowhere was the absence of buyers
noted.
Yet in the absence of buyers lay
the basic reason for the market’s
accelerating downturn a fall which
culminated in a record 21 points being
shaved off the Sydney all-ordinaries
index on Friday, September 27. Buyers
clearly have been dropping by the
wayside, sated perhaps, but more
likely scared off by the extraordinary
upswing in the boom stocks of the last
18 months. London buyers were
notable by their absence; the local
investors were obviously shy pro-
bably for the rather sane reason that
the rise just could not go on for ever.
The psychological factors were all
there; they did not show up on the
point and figure charts.
Looking ahead, it is very uncertain
when buyers will return to the Austra-
lian equity market in any great force.
Lower prices of what are basically
sound stocks the leaders of the
mineral section, WMC, BHP,
Hamersley, CRA, and the like will
attract some support. But the psycho-
logical deterrent here is that there is
a decided prospect that even these
shares will come lower.
“Bear” cover if, as most imagine,
“shorting” was part and parcel of the
downturn * — will provide some sort
of base for fluctuating movements in
the coming weeks and BHP’s treatment
on Monday gave some pointer to that.
On this score it is interesting to note
that the Sydney Stock Exchange will
introduce rules restricting “shorting,” a
practice not before covered at all.
In the same way that it is the basis
of future trends in the economy, capi-
tal inflow will be the basis for future
trends on the share market. Directly, a
return of foreign buyers to the share
market will provide the prop for
another advance. No one can predict
when this will happen; certainly the
better home economy in the U.K.
makes it doubtful if the flow for share
investments will be restored to the
levels of early this year in the foresee-
able future.
Indirectly, capital inflow provides the
excess liquidity in the economy to
enable purchase of shares. It can be
seen, then, that in the capital inflow
lies the key to any revival to the
market of 1968-69.
Sir lan Potter has gone on record
with an estimate that the balance of
payments for the current year will be
in order with a $7OO million current
account deficit offset by a capital
inflow of much the same figure. Assum-
ing this estimate is correct, it must be
pointed out that the $7OO million is
just on $4OO million less inflow than
apparently recorded for 1967-68. In so
far as some part of the $4OO million will
be replaced by additional export
income, there lies a cushioning effect
for the local liquidity scene. However,
the percentage drop in the inflow
figures will be magnified in the port-
folio investment side of the inflow.
For, if no other factor intrudes, the
Government’s direct borrowing will
take up a larger slice of the inflow than
hitherto.
It thus emerges that there will not
be large supplies of money available for
investment in shares or, more certainly,
not as much as was available in the
boom.
Neglected in all the flurry of the
share market is the background
economy. It is agreed all over that the
economy is in great shape. Yet hidden
in lengthy economic prognostications by
the Reserve Bank, the Commonwealth
Bank, and the Treasury (in its White
Paper) in recent publications is the
utterance of a need for caution because
of the capital inflow prospects.
Possibly the White Paper from the
Treasury was more direct than the two
Government agencies were when it sug-
gested that any serious deterioration in
the capital inflow would require “a
shift of resources within the economy
and a pause in the rate of growth.”
Shed of economic qualification, the
“shift of resources” clearly means some
THE CHARTIST SAYS: CSR has been reproduced this week along with
the all-ordinary index No. 15, to illustrate a classic example of a break in trend
and the close relationship in the price movements of the stock and the index, which
is the actual trend of the market. It would now appear that CSR has “topped”
and there is now the possibility of a minimum probable fall to the support level
at $4.00, where the situation would again call for reassessment. Last sale price on
26/9/68 $5.24.
THE CHARTIST WARNS
THE CHARTIST again draws in-
vestors’ attention to the changing
trend of the market and that all higher
projections for stocks previously recom-
mended now can be discounted.


structural changes within the economy.
While the situation has yet to get any-
where near the level requiring such
moves, the trend is there. Against that
background there is little hope for an
early restoration of boom conditions.
OIL SHARES
AFTER THE BOOM
THE STEAM IN THE OIL market
having evaporated, it is instructive to
look at the performance over 12 months
of a representative selection of oil
shares. The accompanying table shows
that current prices may be less than
half boom levels, but they are still a
vast improvement on those ruling at the
end of September last year, when oils
had not caught the public imagination.
Peak prices shown for 1967 and 1968
contain inflation for any issues to share-
holders, there have been a few place-
ments, and in most instances paid-up
capital has also been increased by calls
on contributing shares.
Alliance had a one-for-five par in
December, 1967, and a one-for-two issue
with no renounceable rights, but with
options, in May, 1968. Amalgamated
made a placement in May, 1968. Atapol
Exploration had a one-for-four issue in
November, 1967, and AOG a two-for-
seven in July, 1968. Beach made a one-
for-two in February, 1968, and Magel-
lan has had two issues at one-for-five,
in December, 1967, and August, 1968
(both at premiums). Planet made place-
ments to Mr. W. G. Waterhouse and
Australian Gas Light to finance its
drilling programs.
Quentin Cameron in his “Exploration
News and Views” writes that, although
investors still holding plenty of oil scrip
may not agree with him, in his opinion
the current shakeout is the best thing
that could have happened to the oil
market. If prices had held up at their
previous high levels, or even risen
further, he continues, market activity
would have been greatly diminished as
the number of buyers willing to pay
these prices was gradually exhausted.
A large number of successful investors
will be prepared to try their luck again,
and the main enticement will be low
prices rather than good news. Sooner
or later there will come a general
realisation that oil shares have been
marked back too far and there will be
a rise right across the board. That is
the time to move, Mr. Cameron con-
cludes.
Nonetheless, it is The Bulletin’s con-
tention that good news would not go
astray, and there is no better source
than BHP.
JOHNS AND WAYGOOD
TAXATION ANTICS
IN ITS SECOND RESULT since the
1966 merger, Johns and Waygood
Perry .Engineering was expected to
exhibit increasing strength as economies
of scale and location were considered to
have had time to filter into the
accounts. Something looks to have
blocked the process, if, indeed, it has
been going on at all, because the second
year’s results were worse than the first
showing a drop from 17.7 to 16 per-
cent in the earning rate. But before
rushing to conclusions about this fall
there are the antics of the group’s
taxation provisions to consider. This
year the tax provision was somewhat
higher than the previous year, even
when taking into account the $112,000
(of the net $183,000 addition to the
provision) arising from the increase in
the company tax rate in the last Budget.
Against this, however, the tax provision
was lightened by $45,000 , over-
provision in the previous year now
written back, which compared with
$91,000 similarly treated in the previous
accounts. All of this makes the taxation
provision an unreliable guide; how
much, for instance, has been over-
provided in the latest accounts? The
chairman won’t know this, of course,
when he stands up at the annual meet-
ing. At least he will be expected to
elucidate the year’s experience in other
structural directions, something the
preliminary statement singularly failed
to do.
If trading results turn out to have
been lower for the full year, then, fol-
lowing the reported even result for the
first half, this would indicate a worsen-
ing in the second half, which could
point to a mixed performance between
the various States where the group
operates, and perhaps to South Aus-
tralia, the Perry half’s home State,
again dragging its feet.
The $1 shares, which were as low as
$1.65 earlier this year, have had a
fairly good market recently,, and the
preliminary announcement, in which, of
course, the 10 percent dividend rate
was confirmed, caught them 20 cents
down on their $2 peak for the year.
Some sellers were around at that point,
where the shares yielded 5 percent
and which, even given the present
lofted height of equities in general,
looks a bit inadequate considering
more wage increases seem to be brew-
ing.

have all broadened away from the basic
ice-cream delicacy. Likewise, the one
company which has kept on with the
well-known name, to no apparent disad-
vantage—Peters Ice Cream (W.A.) Ltd.
As with the others, it is as much recog-
nised for a diversification of food
products. And as with the others, and
with all groups concerned with selling
food in Australia, it has had to meet
very intense competition among all
lines handled. In its latest year, the
W.A. company came through fairly
successfully.
But Peters (W.A.) has still another
claim to fame, and investor attention.
In common with so many food enter-
prises in recent years, it has been sur-
rounded by speculative takeover rumors
especially associated with those
“foreigners” away in the eastern States.
Certainly the company could fit very
nicely into the British Tobacco or
George Weston Food empires, and one
or two genuine foreigners could be
interested as well.
Peters, however, has often made it
clear that it does not intend to be
swallowed by “those easterners.”


System / 360
success story:
it's even better
than we promised.
Less than three years ago we
delivered the first SYSTEM /360, a
new concept in computers.
Today SYSTEM/360 will be found in
practically every business in
Australia*. From the model 65, the
largest in Australia, to the smallest
model 20, SYSTEM/360 is living up
to all the forecasts and
expectations claimed for it!
We said SYSTEM/360 would grow
as your needs grow.
It will.
We said it would get even better.
It has.
Better Spaed and Performance
Performance has been boosted
even beyond the outstanding
problem-solving power we had
promised. We’ve cut cycle time
from microseconds to
nanoseconds.
Better Protection of Your
Programming Investment
New hardware devices make
conversion to system/360 easy.
It’s possible for IBM customers to
convert without costly
re-programming. When you get
SYSTEM/360 it’s ready to go to
work.
Now Better for Smaller Businesses
Last June we announced a new
small size SYSTEM /360 with higher
performance cost ratio than
anything we’ve ever offered before.
We are not through improving
SYSTEM/360
The nice thing about this unusual
system is this:
When you need a new way to put
information in or take it out, we can
connect the new device you need
onto this System without changing
in any way how you solve your
problems. We can incorporate new
technological developments in the
System, as they come along. The
System is open-ended. It will grow
as your needs grow.
SYSTEM /360 is the computer with
a future.
We plan to keep it that way.

AUSTRALIAN UNITED CORPORATION LIMITED
Chairman’s Address
As delivered at the Annual General Meeting held on Friday,
13th September, 1968, at 41 1 Collins Street, Melbourne.
Before dealing with the formal mat-
ters relating to the Annual Accounts I
should like to refer to the change in
the management of the Corporation
mentioned in the Report of the
Directors.
Mr. Harty retired as Managing Direc-
tor in March this year. He had held
that position since March, 1963, when
the merger of The Anglo-Australian
Corporation Pty. Limited with this Cor-
poration took place. I am sure share-
holders will join me in thanking Mr.
Harty most warmly for the invaluable
part he has played in guiding the
progress of the Group. I am glad to say
that my colleagues and I will continue
to have the benefit of Mr. Harty’s
assistance as a member of the Board.
We have appointed Mr. Harper, for-
merly Manager of the Corporation’s New
Issues Department, as General Manager
in succession to Mr. Harty’s position as
Chief Executive.
It is with pleasure that I now submit
to you a motion for the adoption of the
Eleventh Annual Balance Sheet and
supporting Accounts of Australian
United Corporation Limited together
with the Reports of the Directors and
the Auditors.
The Consolidated Net Profit of Aus-
tralian United Corporation Limited and
its subsidiaries for the year ended 30th
June, 1968, is $1,313,055 compared with
$1,237,444 for the previous year. Of this
profit $1,276,260 remains to Australian
United Corporation Limited after
deducting the minority interests. Last
year the comparable figure was
$1,189,936.
The Consolidated Net Profit has been
struck after providing for taxation on
a basis consistent with that of the last
two years, although, of course, for this
year’s Accounts, at the increased rate
of tax announced in the Budget. Allow-
ance for past losses of a subsidiary and
for the method of applying taxation to
companies deriving the bulk of their in-
come from dividends and interest are
reflected in the calculation of this
provision.
An interim dividend of 5 percent on
the ordinary and preference capital was
paid on 15th March, 1968, and the fixed
dividend of 5 percent on the preference
capital was paid on 28th June, 1968.
A final dividend of 5 percent on the
ordinary and preference capital has been
declared payable on 13th September,
1968. The total dividend requirement
absorbs $345,352 of the year’s profit,
leaving an amount of $930,908 to be
added to the unappropriated profits of
the Group from the year’s operations.
From these unappropriated profits
$802,046 has been transferred to re-
serves — $325,273 to General Reserves
and $476,773 to Reserve for Contin-
gencies. After payment of the year’s
dividends and the transfer to reserves
the balance of unappropriated profits at
30th June, 1968, was $2,095,919.
As previously announced it is the
intention of the Board to make a bonus
issue. You will, at this Meeting, be
asked to increase the authorised capital
from $4,000,000 to $6,000,000. Subject
to this increase being approved the
Board will declare the bonus issue of
$804,695 (which ignores fractional en-
titlements) to be made out of share
premium reserve in the form of ordinary
shares in the proportion of one new
share for every four ordinary and partici-
pating preference shares held at 30th
August. These bonus shares will rank
for dividend as from 1st July, 1968,
and we expect to maintain dividends
at the annual rate of 10 percent.
I shall now refer to the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.
There was no change in the paid-up
capital of Australian United Corporation
Limited during the year. As stated in
the Directors’ Report accompanying the
Accounts the sale of the Group’s interests
in Ring-Grip Limited and the Palais
Group and the removal of their reserves
from the Consolidated Balance Sheet
affected certain Group reserves and
profit and loss appropriation account.
The transfers to reserves of $802,046
referred to above had the effect of
restoring General Reserves to $2 million
and increasing Reserve for Contingencies
to a Group total of $3,156,501 compared
with $2,542,273 at June, 1967. Part of
this Reserve ($1,800,000) is shown in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a
deduction from various classes of assets.
Reserve on Consolidation has fallen by
$732,461 as a result of the disposal
of certain assets in Australian United
Finance (formerly Sargood Gardiner
Limited) and the sale of the Group’s
interests in Ring-Grip Limited and the
Palais Group of Companies. Reserve on
Consolidation represents the difference
between the cost to Australian United
Corporation Limited of its investment
in subsidiaries and the net worth of
those subsidiaries at the date of acquisi-
tion. As pointed out on previous
occasions this Reserve fluctuates from
year to year as assets which were owned
by companies at the time of their acquisi-
tion are realised. The overall effect of
all movements in Reserves is to show a
reduction of approximately $500,000 in
Shareholders’ Funds over the year.
Current liabilities have risen by
$41,515,405 which reflects increases in
deposits of $42,704,866 and provision
for taxation of $100,173, offset by reduc-
tions of $832,821 in Sundry Creditors
and Clients’ Balances and of $373,288
in Bank Overdraft. These reductions
follow the removal of the accounts of
Ring-Grip Limited and the Palais Group
from the consolidation.
Investments in quoted securities
decreased by $376,331 and the market
value of the Group’s holdings at the
end of the year exceeded book value
(after deducting $900,000 Investment
Fluctuation Reserve) by $1,907,907.
Investment in securities which are not
quoted increased by $913,505. Advances
rose by $13,161,091, holdings of Com-
monwealth Government Securities by
$30,844,365, and of Commercial Bills by
$2,591,461. These increases reflect the
substantial rise in deposits resulting from
a significant expansion during the year
in the activities of our money market
subsidiaries, to which I will refer below.
The substantial reduction in other current
assets and in fixed assets arises through
the sale of Ring-Grip Limited and the
Palais Group of Companies and the
consequent removal of their assets from
the consolidation.
I have given you a summary of the
changes which have occurred in the
Balance Sheet and I believe you will
agree with me that it now more truly
reflects the nature of the business of the
Corporation and shows it to be in a
sound position. I shall now comment on
the various activities of the Group,
during the year.
In the official short-term money
market, in which we operate through
United Discount Company of Australia
Limited, the opportunity arose to make a
further substantial increase in the level
of our operation, and I am pleased to
report a satisfactory increase in the
profits for this subsidiary. I feel it appro-
priate here to record the happy associa-
tion we have had over a number of
years with The Colonial Mutual Life
Assurance Society Limited, who are our
partners in this company.
In November last there was an
increase in yields on the short-dated
Government Securities in which U.D.C.
deals, and these higher yields were
reflected in the cash and conversion
issues offered by the Commonwealth
in February and May of this year. Such
movements (in either direction) are
inherent in the market in which U.D.C.
operates and pose frequent problems in
adjusting the company’s portfolio of
assets in anticipation of likely develop-
ments.
As has been mentioned at previous
Meetings there are three further devel-
opments in the official market which we-
consider would be beneficial to its
operation and would enable it to perform
a still better service to the economy.
The first (and we believe the simplest)
would be a further increase in the
percentage of portfolios which dealer
companies may hold in bills which are
trading-bank obligations. The second
would be for the Reserve Bank to be
able to resell Treasury Notes discounted
by it before maturity, thus making very
short term assets available to the market
to enable it better to absorb the substan-
tial surges in very-short-term funds
which it is called upon to service. Finally
we consider that a valuable service could
be performed for an important sector
of the Australian economy if the official
market was empowered to hold short-
dated semi-governmental authority
securities thus enabling it to make a
market in these obligations.
Through Australian United Accept-
ance Limited and its subsidiary in New
Continue on page 65


Continued from page 64
South Wales, A.U.A. Limited, the Group
provides short term finance to sound
industrial and commercial companies by
loans and by discounting of commercial
bills.
The total outstandings of these Com-
panies have increased substantially over
the past year and this has resulted in a
pleasing increase in operating profit.
Over the last two or three years a
number of companies have been formed
to operate in this short-term commercial
market, mainly by way of bill finance.
Providing sound management is avail-
able such companies can provide a most
useful service in the developing Aus-
tralian economy.
Our investment department has
enjoyed a year of increased activity and
profits. Apart from our own operations
many companies have consulted us on
the matter of the management of the
investments of their superannuation and
pension funds. As' I mentioned last year,
we expect the demand for this service
to increase as the pressure of business
on the direction and management of
industrial companies mounts. Currently
funds which the Corporation manages
or advises amount to some $100,000,000.
As regards our own investments it is
pleasing to see that the profit shown
in the Accounts from dealing in these
investments has been greatly increased
and that the margin at the end of the
year of market value over book value,
which declined only marginally, was still
very substantial. Although there may not
be many years in which market move-
ments assist dealing as much as has this
last year’s market, we will continue active
in this field.
It is of interest that our investment
in L. M. Ericsson Pty. Limited, which
forms a considerable part of our portfolio
of unlisted investments, * received the
benefit of payment in the year to 30th
June, 1968, of the first dividend by that
company.
Although reports in the daily Press
over the past months have indicated that
the flow of new money into the mutual
fund and unit trust industry has been
offset by the rate of redemption of exist-
ing holdings, it is pleasing to report that
the Funds associated with the Group,
through the management company,
Investors Services Limited, have enjoyed
a most successful year.
When one studies the tremendous
growth of the mutual funds and unit
trusts in other parts of the world it is
readily realised the capacity which the
Fund industry possesses for the marsh-
alling of large amounts of individuals’
savings. The results being achieved by
our Funds should ensure that the rate
of application for our units will continue
to grow from within Australia and we
believe that investors from abroad will
increasingly recognise the benefits to be
had from investment in the Funds.
Activity in the business of underwriting
and a placing of new issues was mar-
ginally lower this year than in the
previous year and a greater proportion
of the business done was in areas in
which commissions were somewhat lower.
The result was that the underwriting
department did not contribute to Group
profits in as substantial a manner as it
normally does. However for the coming
year we foresee a considerable improve-
ment in this area.
There has, over the last year or so,
been something of a proliferation of
agencies operating in various fields of
finance in this community. There is of
course no great difficulty attached to
the creation of an agency but those
which are really welcome are those
which are able to show their capacity
to increase the resources of Australian
capital markets, either by opening up
fields of previously unused or unavailable
capital, or by introducing new skills or
techniques to the management of existing
capital. One has only to look at the
quite extraordinary growth of activity
in European capital markets to see what
can be done. In this regard it should
be noted that very many European
capital issues now take the form of a
convertible security. This Corporation
believes that the Australian financial
market is being deprived of an invaluable
tool by the retention of the legislation
introduced in November, 1960. That
legislation was necessary to check a prac-
tice which was making ineffective the
distinction between interest on the one
hand and earnings for equity on the
other, which distinction is basic to the
Australian tax system. We believe how-
ever that it is entirely valid for a com-
pany which has in prospect a long-term
development to seek to raise the cheapest
money possible — borrowed money —
and reward the lender accordingly
when that money has become fully pro-
ductive.
The basic reason for the employment
of the mechanism of convertible notes is
that newly introduced funds of a com-
pany cannot, for some years, be expected
to earn profits at the same rate as the
existing capital of the company. When
convertible notes are issued the offer of
conversion into the future equity of the
company should be on the basis that
the shares will be at a higher price than
at the time the convertible notes were
raised. This is on the assumption that
the company will, as a result of the
successful employment of the funds, be
more profitable than before. If this even-
tuates, the noteholder wall elect to
convert. But in the event the market
value of the shares at the time of con-
version is less than the price of the
shares offered by way of conversion, it
would seem to indicate that the company,
for one reason or another, has not been
as profitable as had been anticipated.
In these circumstances, noteholders would
not exercise their conversion rights and,
therefore-, should be offered at a pre-
determined future date, the repayment
of their loan money.
In our view this type of convertible
stock is not another form of equity
capital. There are, in fact, two agree-
ments made at the time of issue. Firstly,
the lender agrees to lend to the company
and the company agrees to borrow from
the lender and to repay such borrowings
at a fixed future date. And secondly, at
the point of time when the money is
lent, the lender is given an option
exercisable at his choice to subscribe at
some designated future point in time for
new shares at a price determined at the
time of the offer. The effect of these
two agreements is that the lender is
repaid his money. If he is repaid early
then it is so that he can invest in the
equity of the company. If he does not
choose to invest in the equity of the
company he is repaid at a later date.
The tempo of activity on the Aus-
tralian financial scene increases year by
year. We who are associated with it are
keenly aware of the ever greater respon-
sibilities and opportunities which are
being presented to us as a nation. The
fact that Australia did not devalue along
with sterling in November last year may
have marked the beginning of a new
era in the role which the Australian
dollar can play in international finance.
A strengthening of confidence in our
currency must be the initial step to a
future in which we can expect to be
called upon to act industrially, finan-
cially, and economically as a leader in
the Asian/Pacific region.
Uncertainties in the outlook for inter-
national liquidity have affected Australian
capital markets directly during 1967/68
and will continue to do so in the current
fiscal year. The rate at w’hich investment
funds have flowed to Australia during
the past year, despite restrictive measures
imposed by various countries, increased as
overseas investors sought portfolio invest-
ment in Australian mineral stocks as a
hedge against the uncertainties. In addi-
tion, funds for direct investment, especi-
ally for development projects, have been
high and have facilitated greatly the
rate of expansion now taking place.
Within Australia the mobilisation of
funds for investment has been helped by
the formation of the Australian
Resources Development Bank, which
made its first public borrowing with an
issue of transferable certificates of
deposit towards the end of the fiscal
year. At a later date the Bank hopes
to borrow abroad, as and when funds
become available at rates of interest
which can be matched with lending
opportunities in Australia.
Mineral developments undertaken
during 1967/68 have been unprecedented
in the history of our country. Whilst
substanial reserves of nickel and oil and
natural gas have received the greatest
publicity, iron ore, bauxite, coal,
uranium and beach sands have consoli-
dated their known reserves and future
export positions.
The potential which this new mineral
wealth holds for expanding exports, for
import replacement, and for increasing
the degree of industrialisation in Austra-
lia in the 1970s and beyond, is great
So long as Australia can find markets
for her minerals within a world economy
which has been given favourable condi-
tions for growth, and so long as Australia
can achieve the necessary measure of
restraint over rising industrial costs, the
benefits are obvious.
Australia will share with the world
anxieties for a successful and workable
outcome to the efforts now being made
to resolve the problems of international
liquidity. With so much promise for our
national well-being in sight we more
than most must do all we can to co-
operate with those efforts.
The outlook in 1969 for the Australian
balance of payments is as reasonable as
our economic situation normally allows.
The intention of the recent Budget would
appear to have been to restrain demand
somewhat and thereby assist in keeping
imports to a lesser figure than last year.
At present the economy is in a very
buoyant state and we are still endeav-
ouring to do a great deal in a short space
of time. This is understandable and in
many ways not undesirable. But we must
always be aware of the inflationary
pressures such a situation induces. A
flexible approach to such problems is
necessary and the Treasurer has indi-
cated that he will be prepared to act
accordingly.
I should like to close this address by
asking shareholders to join the Board in
expressing their appreciation of the
efforts made by the management and
staff during the past year.


C AG A
FINANCE
COMMERCIAL & GENERAL ACCEPTANCE LIMITED
(Incorporated in New South Wales)
Registered Office: CAGA House, 453 Kent Street, Sydney, N.S.W. 2000
CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS
delivered at
THE ELEVENTH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY
September 24, 1968
CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS
As copies of the Directors’ Report and Accounts for the financial year ended June 30, 1968, are already in your hands,
I assume that you will agree to take them as read.
REVIEW OF ACCOUNTS
The Group net profit for 1967/68 was as announced on July 30 and referred to in the printed accounts $2,466,677, after
providing $1,589,478 for Income Tax.
1 The effect of the increase of 2.5 cents in the dollar retrospective to July 1, 1967, in the rate of tax imposed on public
companies to which reference was made in the Federal Treasurer’s Budget Speech on August 13 was to increase the provision
required to $1,678,378 with a consequent reduction in the net profit to $2,377,777. The comparable result for the previous
year was $2,115,594.
Shareholders’ Funds of the CAGA Group at June 30, 1968, as shown in the accounts and before providing for the above
tax adjustment were $20,873,789, an increase of $1,132,077 from 1967. The General Reserve is now $2,500,000.
At the end of the year under review, public borrowings of $120,796,370 (last year $110,550,012) and Gross Receivables
amounting to $153,219,465 (last year $134,684,225) highlight the year’s expansion.
The published Report contains a comprehensive comparative statement illustrating the consistently increasing after-tax
profits.
One of the Board’s major policy objectives is continually to improve the return on shareholders’ funds.
Action is taken to combat rising costs by aiming for increased efficiency through the constant review of operating
procedures and the maintenance of rigid administrative controls.
The result for the past financial year demonstrates the effectiveness of this policy.
BORROWING
The high rate of inflow of working funds by way of issues of Debenture Stock and Unsecured Notes is due to the status
achieved by CAGA in the open-market borrowing field and in particular to the support of The Commercial Banking Com-
pany of Sydney Limited and Members of the various Stock Exchanges.
The attention of Shareholders is directed to the availability of these securities for the investing of funds for both long
and short terms at favorable rates of interest.
The Company’s healthy cash flow and high liquidity provide at all times adequate funds to meet maturing holdings.
GENERAL
The Company has now completed ten years of operating and each year has shown progress both in business written and
in the profits achieved. There is every reason to think that this progress will be maintained not only in the current year
but in the years ahead.
The area of business has been widened from the early days when the emphasis was on consumer credit. Whilst consumer
financing continues to represent the biggest part, the proportion of commercial financing is increasing. This category covers
bridging finance, commercial loans and lease.
In this past year lease showed the biggest increase in any category. This type of financing is restricted to soundly estab-
lished commercial organisations. The operation of Lease Plan has enabled many manufacturing and service industries to acquire
more efficient plant and equipment than would otherwise have been possible had those organisations been restricted to tradi-
tional sources of finance. It is now clearly established that the finance industry has a valuable role to play in extending its
services beyond the consumer field.
Modification of existing finance plans and the introduction of new plans and services is constantly under review, and
improvement in the range and standard of our services is being achieved.
While there is a wide and growing demand for finance, the Company selects its business with care, but pays special
attention to old and loyal customers. Business has expanded in all States, excepting Tasmania, where the Company has as
yet not operated.
Since our last meeting, Branch offices have been opened at Bundaberg, Queensland, and Warrnambool and Frankston,
Victoria. All Branches are operating successfully.
Having completed ten years of operations and completely overcome some early problems, one would be justified in
predicting an even brighter future. If our progress continues, as I really feel it will, we shall have further reason to congratu-
late our management and staff.
I have always stressed that finance companies do play an important part in a developing community. Because they do
this successfully they should not be penalised by special taxes but should be encouraged to maintain overall progress by
assisting development generally and many young families in particular.
Of immediate significance to shareholders is the satisfactory rate of profitability of trading since June 30 last.
THE COMMERCIAL BANKING COMPANY OF SYDNEY LIMITED
The Managers and Officers of The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited, which has held 40 percent of
the Company’s capital since its incorporation in 1958, have been untiring in their efforts to promote business on behalf of
CAGA, and to them the Directors extend well-deserved thanks.
MANAGEMENT AND STAFF
The shaping of the Management structure has been a important factor in the Group’s success. The individual responsi-
bilities of each executive and staff member are clearly defined at every level.
The Board is ever mindful of the loyalty and enthusiasm of all members of the CAGA Group.
R. J. VICARS, Chairman of Directors.

Indeed, a few years back it proudly
asserted, and proposed to maintain, a
75 percent Westralian ownership. With
listing on all major exchanges, this can
hardly remain true always. Cautious
easterners have perhaps been liking the
prospects and attractions of the West
more and more. The population of
Perth is forecast to expand by 66 per-
cent over the next 12 years. All these
new Western Australians must eat.
The company’s shares, though, have
not lately given particularly vivid evi-
dence of taking much benefit from the
W.A. boom. A perhaps justified fear of
“enormously wealthy” foreign competi-
tion fighting a price-cutting battle has
forced investors to view the situation
carefully, abetted by a warning in this
matter coming from the chairman last
year.
The in-built growth element in the
domestic market has made it reason-
ably easy to show improved results. And
one or two Peters lines are assuredly
in dynamic markets. Quick - frozen
vegetables are now being consumed at
a rate of 10.61 b. a head, compared
with only 2.321 b. in 1960. Poultry, also,
has shown an impressive upward trend
in consumption and per capita con-
sumption has been higher in W.A. than
in the other States; this trend must be
levelling out now. Cultured dairy
products yoghurt, cottage cheese,
and sour cream are finding more
favor, as are frozen snack lines and
frozen meals.
Apart from the distribution of milk
and other dairy products by Brownes
Dairy in Perth and by Peters Cream-
eries in the south-west and southern
areas, Peters has moved into poultry
processing, frozen vegetables and fish,
and Arctic cold storage products.
Dairying is becoming increasingly less
prosperous and export markets have
evaporated. So the company must con-
centrate on the growing domestic
market and confront the supply of
quick-frozen food from the eastern
States.
Peters must face competition from
British Tobacco’s Diamond Foods, Geo.
Weston, Hunts and O’Brien’s in the
chicken market, by Diamond Foods
and Sunny West Co-operative in ice-
cream, and by British Tobacco again
and Edgells in quick-frozen vegetables.
It does not process its own vegetables,

AUSTRALIA'S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
constitute a major part of Peters’ acti-
vities and large sums have been spent
on the Brown’s dairy for modernisation
and extensions. In July, 1965, milk
treatment margins rose for the first time
since 1960, thus boosting the 1966 and
1967 results. But the company found
seasonal conditions in 1967 not good, so
profits dipped. The 1966 result has now
been overtaken by an excellent profit
for 1968, returning 21.8 percent on
capital to allow a 1£ percent bonus
dividend on top of the usual per-
cent rate.
The current share price around the
peak for this year of $1.45 shows a
4.9 percent yield on dividend and 7.6
percent on income more attractive
than Petersville’s 4.8 percent and 5.9
percent. But it must be recognised that
this latter includes some of the inflation
of recent takeover speculation. The
Peters (W.A.) present price compares
with the 1966 peak of $1.92 prior to a
one-for-eight issue at 30c premium in
July of that year. At about $1.44 the
share price cannot be considered exces-
sive, as the 1966 top price, if adjusted
for the issue, would have been $l.BO.
The dividend lift may be a gesture
of optimism by directors or it may be
the bait to another recourse to share-
holders for funds; the bonus dividend
may not be repeated.
The company has seemingly outlayed
about $5 million on new plant, land,
and buildings for expansion in the past
few years. This has been financed by
two issues at 60 percent premium, a
one-for-ten in November, 1964, at 80c,
the one-for-eight in July, 1966, by
retained profits and internal provisions,
and by increasing dependence on
bankers. Capital commitments not yet
provided for and footnoted in the
accounts, were $358,000 at 1968 balance
date, compared with $196,000 in 1967.
So the big spend is not over.
Working-capital, ratio has never
looked very strong. Directors have com-
plained in the past about the slow
return of milk bottles and their non-
return causing serious and growing loss,
too. Homogenised milk is now sold by
the company in cartons. Bank accom-
modation rose again this year for,
although the overdraft in current liabil-
ities fell from $1.5 million to $1.2 mil-
lion; an additional $450,000 of bank
borrowing was classified as secured
long-term liabilities in 1968 accounts.
A more formal arrangement of bor-
rowings or a fresh injunction of equity
capital seems indicated.

BELTANA'S SHOT IN THE
PROFIT ARM
OF E. Z. INDUSTRIES
IN THE CONDITION of the market
at present, it is hardly surprising that
E. Z. Industries’ announcement of a
considerable increase in the proven
reserves of its high-grade zinc/lead
Beltana (S.A.) deposit didn’t attract
much demand for the shares, especially
as the company’s final dividend was re-
duced following a fall in profit from
18.8 c to 16c per share. Nevertheless,
this deposit, which was first reported
in November last year, must take on
considerable significance with the
latest ore reserve figures.
The latest figures are based on re-
sults from a total of 7923 ft. of diamond
drilling which has so far proved up
several separate but connected high-
grade zinc ore sections with different
lead contents. So far, ore reserves are
estimated at 730,000 tons of 37 per-
cent zinc and 2.9 percent lead, and
97,000 tons containing 24 percent zinc
and 12 percent lead. The total footage
has been obtained in 43 holes, giving
an average depth of slightly less than
200 ft. per hole, while the ore has been
proved to extend to a depth of 300 ft.,
indicating that an open-cut operation
would be quite feasible. Earlier dril-
ling had not jajone below 200 ft. and
it could well be found that the ore
continues to greater depths.
The significance of the continued
improvement in reserves at Beltana can
be gauged from a comparison of the
ore grades of 37 percent zinc to the
grades of ore being mined by the
company itself on the west coast of
Tasmania and of the ores mined by
the Barrier companies at Broken Hill.
The Beltana ore is twice as rich in zinc
as the ore which EZ extracts from its
own mines and more than three times
the grades mined at Broken Hill. In
term of value per ton of ore, the Bel-
tana deposit would be to EZ what Juno
is to Peko-Wallsend. At the current
price of zinc at $230, a ton of Beltana
ore (ignoring recovery, etc.) is worth
around $B5. This figure compares with
the Juno ore, which is worth around
$llO (but which is from an under-
ground mine); with EZ’s own mines
in Tasmania, which were the richest in
Australia before Juno and which have
a metal content worth about $l2O per
ton of ore; Mt. Morgan’s $6O per ton
from its copper-gold open-cut; and
Western Mining Corporation’s Kam-
balda nickel ore, worth some $7O per
ton, which again is from an under-
ground mine.
The company has not indicated how
much overburden would have to be
removed in order to extract the ore,
but in other respects there is sufficient

information to suggest that the Beltana
operation will be particularly profitable.
The actual desposit is only 1£ miles
from the central Australian railway line,
some 150 miles north of Port Augusta.
As the ore is a silicate rather than a
sulphide, its high grade would allow it
to be fed directly to a smelter circuit
without going through a process of
concentration. In fact, a limited amount
could be added directly to the smelter
which the company already operates at
Hobart. The combination of these fac-
tors builds up quite favorably; as an
illustration, the deposit certainly
appears capable of being developed for
an extraction rate of, say, 100,000 tons
of ore per year using a recovery
rate of 90 percent and ignoring the
lead content, the zinc content of the
ore treated would total just over 33,000
tons of zinc, giving a gross revenue of
$7.6 million (at $230 per ton for zinc).
On the costs side, the economies of
open-cast mining could be diminished
by the relatively small tonnage assumed,
but offsetting this to some extent is the
lack of any great developmental expen-
diture necessary the deposit is very
close to existing rail facilities and the
company has extensive plant at Hobart.
It is rather difficult to calculate the
cost of smelting and refining the zinc
ore, as the Hobart smelter-refinery com-
plex uses concentrates coming from
both its own mines (which make up
about 30 percent of feed in a normal
year) and the Broken Hill mines. But
bearing in mind the possibility that
actual mining and concentrating costs
will be relatively low, a reasonable esti-
mate would be in the range of $l5-$2O
per ton of ore, a total of between SIJ
and $2 million giving a gross profit of,
say, ss£ million.
On its mining operations at present,
the company pays tax at the rate of
about 30 percent, and with tax then of,
perhaps, $1.5 million net profit from
the Beltana operation would be in the
vicinity of $4 million. It is likely to
be rather more than this in the event
that the deposit is worked on a scale
larger than the 100,000 tons per year
which would bring mining costs to a
lower figure.
On the company’s 36 million shares,
the calculations above indicate that
profit could benefit by some 11 cents
per share when production begins from
this new deposit. This is a significant
amount compared to earnings for the
year just past of 16 cents per share and,
should further increases in ore reserves
be made, the potential profit from
Beltana would be increased consider-
ably as, on the extraction rate assumed
above, the deposit would have a life of
about nine years.
By the time the company is treating
its first ore from this deposit, it is likely
that its production from the existing
mines on the west coast of Tasmania
will have begun to increase. Last year
these mines produced a total of 296,953
tons of ore and by 1972 could be pro-
ducing up to twice as much as this.

Both Beltana and the west-coast mines
are rich lead/zinc deposits and the
company appears to be increasing its
interest in these base metals with its
joint proposal (with Peko-Wallsend
Limited) for the exploration and assess-
ment of the “Woodcutters” lead/zinc
prospect near Rum Jungle, in the
Northern Territory. This prospect was
discovered by Federal Government
agencies when looking for uranium in
1966.
On the industrial side, the company
is engaged in a $5.5 million capital
expenditure program at its Risdon
plant, which will increase capacity at
lower cost, and in July it announced
its intention to join with Mt. Lyell
Mining in the construction of a $l4
million sulphuric acid plant at Burnie
which will treat the pyritic residues
from both its own mines and the Mt.
Lyell copper mine at Queenstown.
This plant, to be commissioned early
in 1970, will be one of the biggest
sulphuric acid plants in the world, and
its financing is to be by way of $lO
million of loans with the balance of
$4 million to be contributed jointly
’by both Mt. Lyell and E. Z. Industries.
With its very strong cash flow, E. Z.
must rank as one of the most promising
.mining situations should share prices
continue to fall, as it appears unlikely
that shareholders will be asked to con-
tribute more capital and the major
areas of growth in the immediate
future years will come from higher
production rather than improving metal
prices. Of course, should base metal
prices take a turn for the better, the
benefit to E. Z. would be considerable,
but last year’s profit is likely to be
the lowest the company should ex-
perience for some time, as it >vas
affected not only by lower metal prices
but also by the rationing of electricity
due to Tasmania’s very bad drought.
The drought meant that power con-
sumption was reduced by 35 percent
during the last financial year and this
affected both the company’s production
of refined zinc as well as its sulphate
of ammonia production.
Security analysis
BRICKS AND MORTAR:
THE HIGH RISE OF
STOCKS & HOLDINGS
THE SHAKEOUT behaviour of the
sharemarket in the past fortnight has
reminded me of the 19 th century
father’s admonition to his profligate
son: “Put thy money in bricks and
mortar, lad.” Well, an analyst has to
follow the market even in the down-
turns, but that sound advice set me
thinking about the property develop-
ers who have been reporting a high-
rise year. Profits and dividends are on
the upswing, while bonus issues have
brought a smile to shareholders’ faces.
Smiles are rare in the current market,
yet I have noticed property stocks are
holding their own while the rest of
the market is taking a pounding. How-
ever, I still think the Australian in-
vestor hasn’t yet woken up to the fact
that investment in property doesn’t
pay off next week or next year. He has
consistently undervalued this section
of the market, preferring to bid up
mining and oil on what they may be
dragging out of the earth five to ten
years hence.
They take a different view of these
things in London, as I realised after
doing some work on 33 leading
property companies listed on the Lon-
don Stock Exchange. After Australian
experience it was interesting to see
price/earnings ratios range from a 14.9
low to a rarefied high of 50, with the
median at 28.2. Bearing in mind that
the ratio expresses the number of
years’ earnings the market is paying
for the share based on its current price,
one can see the long-term attitude of
the London investor.
The key point is that property com-
panies with strong management, a first-
rate development program and top-
flight financing provide an investor with
a virtually guaranteed income. The re-
quired return on capital investment is
known, this sets the rents, tenants are
available, and steady income is there-
by assured. That’s more than can be
said for most industrial stocks, which
live from year to year. It seems to me
that buying into “bricks and mortar”
has twofold advantage of beating mar-
ket cycles and inflation at one stroke.
The lowest price/earnings ratio for
a British property company listed on
the London Exchange was 14.9 for R.
Green Properties Ltd. Even by Aus-
tralian standards this is not a large
company, as total assets were £stg.s.7B
million in 1967 (in post-devaluation
terms, around $12.5 million). Earning
rate on capital was 14.0 percent. At the
other end of the scale, Trafalgar House
Investment Ltd. has a ratio of 50,
total assets in 1967 were £stg. 16.09
million ($34.8 million) and earnings
represented 7.2 percent on capital. By
comparison five leading Australian
developers I examined had these ratios
and earnings:—-

•Hooker 12 2 13.9
Stocks & Holdings 13 6 54 5
Westfield Development 14 8 27 0
Lend Lease 10.7 21.4
On this basis the Australian com-
panies are well below the London
norm, and in view of their growth
record seem badly undervalued. At the
moment I want to take a closer look
at Stocks and Holdings, since in rela-
tion to earnings on capital it seems
to have the lowest price of the five by
far.
Applying the three measuring devices
used in London, Stocks and Holdings
makes the grade on all counts. Invest-

ors have regarded the company’s man-
agement as a one-man band under its
founder, Erwin Graf, and, while it is
true that Graf controls the organisation
created 18 years ago from scratch, he
has built up a strong managament team
to handle the group s expanding
activities. Technical and administrative
talent in depth is a must in a property
company which also does its own sur-
veying, engineering, architectural, and
legal, work, and men of the calibre
required woudn’t stay around for long
if there was no delegation,
On the development side, Stocks and
Holdings’ most notable project to date
j s the Park Regis mixed development
i n t he heart of Sydney. Park Regis is
the first commercial/residential corn-
plex to go up in any inner-city area,
an d t he company’s belief in demand for
city apartments is paying off hand-
somely. The building is fully integrated,
with two shopping floors, four car-park
levels, a ten-storey motel, and 29
storeys of apartments, topped by a
swimming-pool 430-feet above Park and
Castlereagh Streets. Apartment sales
have been described as excellent and
good income will start flowing in
during the current year.
Although Park Regis is a major pro-
ject, Stocks and Holdings has wide-
ranging interests throughout New South
Wales and Canberra. Special attention
has been given to the company’s tradi-
tional interests in land development,
housing estates, home units, and town
houses. The group is currently en-
gaged in erecting a luxury 13-storey
home unit block at Manly, a 750 home
development at Oyster Bay, continua-
tion of the Ocean View Park-Maroubra
project, which will eventually provide
housing for 4000, and smaller develop-
ments at Roxborough Park, Jannali,
Baulkham Hills, and Drummoyne.
Balancing up housing activity is the
strong investment division. The Im-
perial Arcade between Pitt and Castle-
reagh Streets is well known as a highly
successful venture, as are the group’s
ten shopping centres scattered through-
out New South Wales, all of which are
contributing solidly to profits. Future
expansion in investment properties is
based on the YMCA site in Liverpool
Street and Piccadilly Arcade, also be-
tween Pitt and Castlereagh. Stocks and
Holdings plans a Park Regis-type
development in Liverpool Street with
a tentative completion date sometime in
1971. Using Park Regis as a yardstick,
the scheme looks geared to success from
the start. Piccadilly Arcade is to be
used as a straightout investment for a
few years, although the group is work-
ing on its eventual redevelopment when
the overall picture in the central-city
area becomes a bit clearer.
Sound financing is an outstanding
feature of Stocks and Holdings’ opera-
tions. The company’s balance sheet at
June 30, 1967, showed a gearing (ratio
of shareholders’ funds to total assets)
of 1.9, the lowest in the Australian
property business, and better than most
English /property companies. The ex-
traordinary low reliance on borrowed
funds has minimised outflow of interest,
and given the company a financial
strength which will enable it to weather
the worst crises.

(AUSTRALIA) LIMITED
FOURTEENTH
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING,
Address by the Chairman
1968
The Company fought back strongly in
the year under review and consolidated
its position in both sales and profits,
which is not an easy feat in this highly
competitive market. The trend through-
out the year was upward, a refreshing
movement after the experience of pre-
ceding years.
Although it normally takes at least
three years to establish a new brand
with reasonable volume, it is encourag-
ing to see that certain brands we have
released in the last two years are already
selling at a good rate, which suggests
they will have a long-term future.
While the brightening sales picture
has helped to raise profits, this should
not obscure the valuable contribution
which has also come from the constant
search to improve efficiencies and elimi-
nate waste.


Looking to the future, with the ob-
jectives of minimising costs and avoid-
ing the inroads of obsolescence, a firm
programme is in hand which will keep
factory buildings up to the most modern
levels and ensure that the factories are
at all times equipped with the latest and
most efficient manufacturing devices.
The programme involves substantial
capital expenditure, but it should be
possible to provide the total sum re-
quired from internal resources.
Indeed, the Company’s financial
position is very strong. Its assets are
well depreciated, or otherwise conser-
vatively valued. It has virtually no long-
term liabilities, and its current liabilities
are within desirable limits for this in-
dustry. There has been a significant re-
duction in short-term deposits, all of
which mature at convenient dates. Its
reserves and undivided profits at
$12,175,278, are now well in excess of
the paid-up capital of $9,112,500.
You will have noted how the Com-
pany has been quietly and firmly attack-
ing new segments of the cigarette
market. Its market strength is growing
in all price classes and in the various
types of cigarettes. The association with
Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co., the
famous American cigarette manufac-
turers, will add further to this competi-
tive strength. The entry into the cigar
market a few years ago has had splen-
did success, and now in this past year
the first moves have been made to
market the well-known pipe and roll-
your-own tobaccos from the House of
Edgeworth, Larus & Brother Company,
Inc. of U.S.A.
In short, I am confident that the
Company has come out of the trough
which beset it for some time, and has
prospects of good growth under the
concerted plans for future development
which are being implemented.
Consequently, we expect to see con-
tinued improvement in sales and profits
in the current year, and the dividend
rate of 16 cents per share should be
comfortably maintained.
The results which are emerging re-
flect consistent hard work by our
General Manager, executives and staff,
and my colleagues on the Board wish
me to make special reference to this,
because the effort has been quite extra-
ordinary. I know this effort will be sus-
tained.

Discovering beautiful
sounds among the chaos
Nigel Butterley (in coat and tie) de-mystifying his music in a demon-
stration at the Sydney Conservatorium ... “My music isn’t avant-garde”
Classicist Barry Conyngham (left) and jazzman
Don Burrows ... now they have more to talk about
By SANDRA HALL
AT A TIME when Australian school-
children still tend to believe all com-
posers are dead, young Sydney composer
Anne Boyd, with short skirt, blonde hair,
and a complexion which doesn’t need
make-up, is probably modern music’s
best kind of public relations officer.
It needs one. At present it is leaving
behind not only the musical conven-
tions of harmony and melody, but also
some of its audiences. Australian com-
posers are well aware of this, and in
Sydney are trying to de-mystify their
art with a series of lecture demonstra-
tions at the Small Hall at the N.S.W.
Conservatorium of Music.
“The thing is,” Anne Boyd was
saying in the cause of clarity, after last
week’s talk by Nigel Butterley, “every-
body can be a composer. Recently, I
went to give a talk on contemporary
music to a very sedate group of North
Shore people 35 and upwards. After
I’d talked for a while I said the best
thing to do was to have them join
in, so we got together every music-
making device in the house knives,
forks, spoons, and saucepans, as well
as instruments like guitars and flutes.
“I said right, we’re going to make
sounds, and they did ... a ghastly
effect at first, chaotic. And I told them
so, and got them to put some shape
into it. And you know, at the end of
it, those people, with no formal musical
training, actually had produced a short
composition sitting on the floor in
this North Shore living-room.”
One interesting by-product of
modern music’s revolution (if it is a
revolution, which is another topic to be
discussed in the lecture series) is that
acceptance of improvisation has given
classical and jazz composers more to
talk about. Jazz musician Don Burrows
hasn’t missed one lecture in the series,
and he had his own anecdote to con-
tribute about the workshop sessions
in which he has been taking part with
classical musicians.
"They wanted me to improvise, and
I refused. What was the point? I
thought it would be more interesting if
they, men who’ve always said they
just can’t improvise, were to try it.
Well, they didn’t know where to start
they said so. So I got them to
take three notes only and to think of
a sunrise something we’ve all experi-
enced . . . the warmth, the light and
to express it as they felt it, joining
me as they felt impelled to respond
to anything I played. And they did
they crept in one at a time until bit
by bit we had the most beautiful piece
of music.”
Musicians like Burrows and Anne
Boyd can afford to talk in such radical
terms, of course, because they have
solid musical backgrounds and know
very well all the conventions from
which they’re deviating.
So far their credo of “creative music-
making,” or experiments in sound, has
managed to filter into university classes
and into some of the schools, but the
N.S.W. Education Department’s con-
servatism makes it prefer its students
to work on the more proven intricacies
of imitation Bach chorales.
“And if kids have been doing that
kind of work up to the age of 14 or
15, there’s not much chance of getting
them interested in experimental music
after that,” Barry Conyngham, one of
Australia’s youngest composers, who
also teaches at Abbotsleigh, believes.
“You have to introduce them to it
before they’re 11.”
He and Anne Boyd, both in their
20s, are explicit about the cause of
their own emergence as composers
while still students —Professor Donald
Peart of Sydney University’s Music
Department, one of the organisers of
the lecture series. “Any student who
comes to him with a score is heard
immediately,” Anne Boyd said. “I tutor
at Sydney, and even in the first-year
class I take, the students write sound
pieces.”
This kind of encouragement and the
overseas success of the earlier group
of Australian composers, represented
by Richard Meale, Peter Sculthorpe,
and Butterley, has meant that things
have been made easy for Conyngham,
Anne Boyd, Alison Bauld, and the other
young writers just beginning to make
their names known.
“It’s been a phenomenon of the past
five years,” Anne Boyd said. “Peter and
Richard did have to fight, and they
came back from overseas and paved
the way for us —so that it’s been made
easy. In America, I’m told, it’s mar-
vellous. The colleges have excellent
facilities, and everything the students
write is done, but in Europe it’s extra-
ordinarily hard for young composers.”
Conyngham put it even more
succinctly. “I’ve been in composing
for two years and already I know
everybody.”
Nigel Butterley’s lecture demonstra-
tion was enlightening because of its
glimpses into the motivations and the
methods of a composer. Unlike Scul-
thorpe, with his preoccupation with
Asian music, and Meale, who is in-
fluenced by everything from Japanese
Kabuki music to the Beatles, Butterley
named no specific sources for his in-
spiration. Paintings, poetry, friendships,
good meals, and good wine all played a
part. And Butterley determinedly dis-
claimed the avant-garde tag, although

The card for the man on the move!
his audience may have felt differently
about some of the tapes they heard.
“The term avant-garde doesn’t mean
anything much,” he said. “My music
isn’t avant-garde it has no particular
label.”
He was interested in overlapping
patterns of sound —“the idea of several
things happening at the same time”
and he demonstrated what he meant
in “Music for Sunrise,” a piece written
for the pupils of a school in the Sydney
suburb of Beecroft, where he lives, a
second piece for the New Sydney Wind
Quintet, and his orchestral work, “The
Meditations of Thomas Traherne,”
which was completed this year and
played by Moshe Atzmon and the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra.
The last, triggered by “Centuries of
Meditations,” a book by Traherne, the
English poet and metaphysical writer,
had been in his mind for four years,
waiting until he found time to do it
and until his style matured. “I think
it improved by waiting. When it came
to writing it, I felt relaxed about it.”
Apparently he was justified, for when
it came to the end of the tape and that
excruciating time when question time
is called, there were no questions, just
one comment from a woman who said
quite firmly that she thought it was
beautiful. The tension broken, the
audience applauded enthusiastically.
Modern music will bridge that com-
munication gap yet.
UNFORGETTABLE
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
SOME SINGERS are possessed of a
magical quality which completely
annihilates the barrier between them and
their audience and, oddly enough, there
are quite a few indifferent performers
among them. But when this rapport is
wedded to a voice of warmth and
beauty the experience is unforgettable.
In Janet Baker’s singing this quality
is paramount, for there is an almost
tangible link between her and her
listeners, although she makes no over-
tures of the “my dear public” ilk and
her work is always stylish and techni-
cally immaculate. She exhibits perfect
control over every aspect of vocalis-
ation, making the music flow with the
smoothness and an inevitability which
is astonishing, for she can reduce her
voice to a thin thread of sound which
is at the threshold of silence, but still
has a depth and presence which be-
speaks perfect voice production.
I often wonder how many people
imagine singers swan on to the plat-
form and toss things off and how few
realise the devotion, dedication, and
damned hard work that goes into the
most seemingly simple and undemand-
ing song. Although Miss Baker possesses
a naturally beautiful voice, all her work
shows meticulous preparation, nothing
is left to chance, and yet the mechanics
are never superficially apparent.
The people who only heard her in
the “Alto Rhapsody” of Brahms at the
Town Hall with the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra, under Fritz Rieger, prob-
ably wondered what all the fuss was
about. Brahms’ autumnal piece is not
calculated to stir up much rapture,
despite its title, and there is a sort of
austerity about it which not even the
warmth of a Baker could assuage. In
fact, the main success of the concert
was a first-class performance of Hinde-
mith’s symphony “Mathis der Maler.”
There are few composers today who
can make music sound like Hindemith
can, and Fritz Rieger released all the
sonority in the work and rarely has
the orchestra played better.
The ardent quality in Janet Baker’s
voice was manifest from the first note
in the Handel cantata “Armide Abban-
donata,” with which she opened her
recital at the Sydney Conservatorium.
It is some seasons since we have heard
such a flood of beautiful sound. This
was, indeed, the major ingredient of the
recital, for at no time was there a
hint of the cavernous hooting much
beloved of mezzos and below, and her
top notes had a purity, and at times
an ingenuous quality, which was most
affecting.
Miss Baker is a great recitalist, but
I doubt if she is yet a great lieder
singer, and I say this in the face of
almost irrefutable evidence to the con-
trary. Her recording of the “Woman’s
Life and Love” cycle of Schumann and
the great majority of the lieder in this
program were as close to perfection as
one could wish, yet there were times
when I missed the touch of the brittle,
of sophistication, and of extroverted
histrionics. However, it seems a poor
thing to quibble about a singer lacking
worldly and unworthy traits, yet I do
feel that in the vast spectrum of music
these traits have their place. Where
Miss Baker is almost unique is in her
vocal portrayal of the warm, the gen-
erous, and the sparkle of uncomplicated
joy, which made Peter Warlock’s
“Pretty Ring Time” such a delicious
experience.
It did not require the superlative
straight pianism of the postlude to
Quilter’s “Love’s Philosophy” to
advance the claims of Geoffrey Par-
sons’ musicianship, for this was
apparent all the evening and the pro-
gram’s quote from the London “Daily
Telegraph”— “. .. he must be un-
rivalled among today’s accompanists”
is no opinion but a clear statement
of fact.
The Musica Viva’s last offering for
this year, the Parrenin String Quartet,
gave the first out-of-town run of their
visit at Trinity Grammar for the
school’s Society of the Arts. I cannot
remember when I enjoyed a concert
more. In an ideally sized hall with
superb acoustics, the immediacy of the
sound was startling. The ravishing lyric-
ism of the first movement of Alban
Berg’s String Quartet was given the
most eloquent reading I can ever
remember having heard, and the fiery
vitality in the second movement was
electrifying.

ORSON THE GREAT
Chimes at Midnight. Director, Orson
Welles.
FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
“A PLAGUE of sight and grief! It
blows a man up like a bladder,” says
Falstaff, in excuse for his increasing
girth. As the role is often played, this
sounds like a bit of humorous extrava-
gance spoken by a comical old party.
When Orson Welles speaks the line, it
seems like a rueful, accurate state-
ment of fact.
For there is always a deep under-
current of sadness in Welles’ interpreta-
tion of Falstaff. He continues his mad
career of drinking, wenching, and gen-
eral irresponsibility because it is the
only one he knows, but the joy has
gone. He recognises himself as an
anachronistic survivor from an obsolete
age and, in any case, was it ever
as jolly and carefree as he likes to
pretend? “How subject we old men are
to this vice of lying!” he reflects after
a reunion with Shallow, who beguiles
his old age with senile and inaccurate
reminiscences of his wild youth.
Even Falstaff’s association with the
young heir-apparent has its undertones
of a melancholy prescience of parting.
Hal’s amicable teasing of his fat friend
is rapidly turning into vicious baiting.
Both he and Falstaff realise that their
friendship is only temporary, an interval
of sowing wild oats for a man who
knows he must soon assume the respon-
sibility of kingship. When at his coro-
nation the new King Henry V coldly
rejects his old companion, Falstaff
shows bitter disappointment but no
real surprise his earlier promises to
get his old friends appointments and
benefits were obviously hollow even
when made. “The King has killed his
heart,” said Mistress Quickly as Fal-
staff lies dying; but though Hal may
have dealt the final death blow, the
mere passing of time has already
afflicted him mortally.
Welles’ performance is undoubtedly
a great one the interpretation is
original and beautifully sustained by
the acting, as well as by Welles’ own
arrangement of the screenplay from
the Shakespeare plays. The film is not
to be missed for this central character-
isation, though as a piece of film-
making it has grave faults. These are
not on the whole to be blamed on
Welles’ direction, but on the fact that
his conception is obviously grander
than the available finance and resources.
So, though the use of camera is often
imaginative, the lighting is dingy and
fuzzy. The synchronisation of dialogue
is often off-beam to the point of distrac-
tion. One comes away from “Chimes
at Midnight” admiring Welles as an
actor rather than as a director, though
there are some striking scenes not-
ably the battle sequence, a horrifying
picture of men hacking, bleeding, and
dying in the mud. Heroism and valor
are forgotten in this senseless carnage


“What is honor?” asks Falstaff
bitterly.
In general, Welles’ supporting
players don’t do him justice. In par-
ticular, Keith Baxter is totally inade-
quate as Prince Hal; his performance,
full of modern, Method-ish soul-
searching, has no feeling for the period,
and, worse, he never convinces either as
a roisterer or as a prince of the blood
royal. John Gielgud, frail and wraith-
like, is far more impressive as Henry IV.
There are impressive names in the
cast Jeanne Moreau, Margaret Ruth-
erford, Walter Chiari. But, since they’re
badly miscast, their participation is
not as helpful as might be. However,
with all its faults, this film is rewarding
for the complexity and deep under-
standing of Orson Welles’ splendid
performance.
SHAW'S REVENGE
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
You Never Can Tell. George Bernard
Shaw. Old Tote Theatre, Sydney.
THIS PLAY seems to me remarkably
short on contemporary appeal. By this
I do not mean simply that Shaw’s ideas
are dated. No doubt they are, but that
is not enough in itself to make a play
seem totally out of sympathy with its
audience. Nor do I believe that realism
of character-drawing or verisimilitude
of plot are valid criteria today. What
makes an old play sympathetic or
relevant now is neither its technique
nor its subject-matter, but rather its
total artistic meaning.
The program tells us that Shaw’s
intention was to imbue “the form of
commercial farce popular at the time
. . . with the reality of life.” This means
that a set of characters whose natures
and reactions are conceived in terms of
some sort of psychological realism are
put into a flatly conventional plot. A
scene of reunion after 18 years is
played by a cross and unlovable father
and “modern,” intelligent children who
have been brought up in ignorance of
his existence.
Shaw speaks in the preface of “an
exhibition of eating and drinking by
people with an expensive air, attended
by an if-possible-comic waiter” as a
convention of popular comedy. But his
aim. is 'to “show that the drama can
humanise such things as easily as they,
in the wrong hands, can dehumanise
the drama.” Consequently, the
luncheon in “You Never Can Tell” has
one of the guests (the father) furious
with the others (the family who have
abandoned him), the whole situation
being controlled by a philosophising
waiter. This would be a perfectly con-
ventional farce situation were it not for
the fact that it is made to support
Shavian dialogue jokes about democ-
racy and the Church of England, and
squeezed into four pages of 'text: a
four-course meal for seven angry
people in rather less than ten minutes.
Thus Shaw contrives to write a con-
ventionally funny scene and to send it
up at the same time.
This means that, ultimately, charac-
terisation, plot, and verbal wit do not
add up to a total point of view or
•statement: the characters are designed
for the express purpose of making a
mockery of 'the plot, while the comic
dialogue of social comment forms a
rather deceptive facade to the play’s
internal division. This scheme of things
does not seem to me to allow any
sense of independent life to the char-
acters, or to form the “superbly warm,
optimistic human document” of which
the program speaks. I found, on the
contrary, only a rather half-hearted
send-up of a now-vanished style of
commercial theatre and its audience of
“perfectly commonplace people.”
Soon after finishing it Shaw wrote of
the play, “Could anyone read it? It
maddens me. I’ll have my revenge in
the preface by offering it as a frightful
example of trying to write for the
theatre of today.” In short, Shaw’s
conscience and commercialism cannot
be said to combine very successfully.
The play is directed by Jim Shar-
man with model restraint. There is a
notable freshness in some surface details
of the production, there is a generous
and appealing attempt to locate a heart
in the play’s mechanism, but, finally,
this is a smooth, honest, and thoroughly
professional treatment of the text.
Jacki Weaver’s part seems to have
been written with her in mind; Ken
Shorter’s spirit is willing, though his
technique not yet quite able; together
with Rona Coleman and Ross Thomp-
son they do remarkably well in infusing
a sense of youth and vitality into the
play. Shaw and Dan O’Sullivan do
little to make the unlovable father any-
thing more than unlovable; Doreen
Warburton’s whole stage presence
inevitably suggests a slight comic exag-
geration, but she is admirably restrained
as the mother, and Ron Haddrick is
ideally cast as the waiter. Yoshi Tosa’s
delightful set the most successful
use of the Tote’s stage I’ve seen
Jacki Weaver, Allan Edwards in “You
Never Can Tell”
PHOTOGRAPH BY ROBERT WALKER
contributes greatly to the freshness and
directness of the production. I wish I
could see as much life in the play as
there is in this treatment of it.
NOT A GOOD YEAR
ART/ELWYN LYNN
The Blake. Commonwealth Savings
Bank, Sydney.
Jannis Spyropoulos. David Jones’,
Sydney.
THE 1968 BLAKE is in general so
timid, so bleak, so sweet, or so brash
that one wonders whether the visionary
urgency of its past successes has been
inhibited by all that seems hardly
transcendental: the pill, swinging par-
sons, and secular vicars. The creative
zest of art has been so often associated
with religious ecstasy that for some
even the most dead-pan minimalist can
evoke that oceanic sensation that Freud
found in religion.
Certainly a good flat-abstractionist
can attain some of the rhapsody and
buoyant rapture that, for example in
Hopkins’ earlier poetry, has been re-
lated to joyous revelation and heady
contentment, but the new abstrac-
tionists, here represented in a minor
way by Stuart Maxwell, Sylvia Holmes,
Robin Kitching, and Patrick Boileau,
abhor the notion that their work might
harbor metaphysical messages. It is al-
most an article of faith with them that
they do not exhibit in theme-shows. All
this reminds us that the better days
of the Blake coincided with the release
of creativity associated with the advent
of romantic abstract expressionism
which saw art as a symbolic enuncia-
tion of the feelings.
One feels as sceptical of the identi-
fication of creativity with religious ex-
perience as one does of the notion
that art, as supporters of Arts Vietnam
seem to think, is anti-destructive and
the motives associated with it pacifistic;
well, Tinguely has made self-destruc-
tive machines and Morse Peckam’s
“Man’s Rage for Chaos” sees art as
bringing not peace but a sword.
Without going at all deeply into
what feelings are involved in religious
or secular art, let me tell a moral tale:
outside the Galerie Schone Aussicht
which held part of the Documenta at
Kassel, Germany, was a huge sign
urging visitors to see a protest exhibi-
tion opposed to American and Russian
imperialism. The exhibition of suffering
bodies was painted before the Czecho-
slovakian occupation by Russia, but the
artist, who obviously thought Docu-
menta an uncommitted game, felt com-
pelled to include the Russians. His was
a Vietnam-Czechoslovakian lamenta-
tion. One recalls the anti-Fascist exhibi-
tion in Melbourne in 1942, when you
could hardly hold them in Germany
or Italy, though you have anti-Ameri-
can exhibitions in New York right now.
It might be more difficult to stage
a religious exhibition like the Blake in
New York; the lone protester is Keith


Looby with a triptych of drawings,
Rejection of the Wholly One, which
combines Martin Sharp, Scarfe, and
Looby’s peculiar view of the world as
human fungus proliferating pendulous
flesh. Only Salvatore Zoffra achieves
some exuberance in a crucifixion that
takes place in Gauguin’s Brittany.
Arch Cuthbertson’s Crowning With
Thorns in crusty brown has a remote
majesty achieved elsewhere only by
Roger Kemp in two resonant works,
much freer and less bound in black
than usual. Geoff Parr’s large mauve
emptiness with a pale cubist city fading
away at the top is lost in the babel of
styles which range from kinetic lights
to Nigel Murray-Harvey’s appropriately
named Tower of Babel, a kind of tossed
salad of Indiana’s blocky letters.
Few have been washed in the blood
of a lamb or have felt the anguish of
departing faith: sweetness in Ken Buck-
land is a pleasant yellowed crustiness;
in Jean Appleton it is cool triangles,
and in Kmit it reduces Chagall to
trifling decoration. Even Orban, who
won in 1967, produces in Genesis little
more than a stained golden sun as
though the creation began with restaur-
ant interiors. Only Kemp and Weaver
Hawkins with a rather happy Death of
Orphans deepen their works with com-
plex rhythms.
In two rather unsuccessful works, Eric
Smith is the least complacent of
believers; it’s not clear what his A
Christian Artist Looks at Today’s World
(he sees mainly loose action paint and
an emaciated Biafran (?) child) or
Medieval Man and Christian Man are
about; maybe they look unresolved
(and memorable) because he does not
feel saved or safe.
The true visionary who shows what
metaphysical depths may be found in
painting is the distinguished 52-year-
old Greek Jannis Spyropoulos; his
world is a dark brown, black, or grey
void where one glimpses fugitive forms
of floating headstones crumbling at the
edges, or fragile documents. Sudden
flashes of red, a yellow sliver of light,
or abrupt pieces of collage render dra-
matic works like Page No. 4; a manu-
script may be wafted up through misty
greys; in Prothessis L a faded city is
about to emerge or sink beneath a black
sky with its red-and-white horizon.
Nowhere is his work a matter of
mere atmospherics and, even in the
quiet, undramatic, small oriental pieces
(14 x 9in., $435), those subterranean
forces, which erupt so powerfully in
Diptych, are present. One feels always
on the verge of discovery or, as with
Rembrandt with whom this romantic
abstractionist has some kinship, as
though something intangible is con-
tinually eluding one.
It is an art so full of suggestions
that it reveals (if it ever does so fully)
itself gradually. Why, like Nolan’s large
Greek landscapes, they are so dark is
a matter of conjecture: perhaps, unlike
others, he sees civilisation as an ephem-
eral flash in the gloom; he certainly
doesn’t see the world in clear black and
white as do protesters and proselytisers.
Communicating
JOBBING ANDREW
WHEN Rigbys published an estimated
70,000 copies of Andrew Jones’ pre-
cocious autobiography last year, the
young Liberal Member for Adelaide
seemed like a fair bet for the quick
best-seller lists, even if only for his
curiosity value. Now it seems that
“Andrew Jones MHR by Himself” was
not a good publishing proposition at
all. Last week, Adelaide bookshops
were jobbing it out at 10 cents a copy
as an “Outstanding Special,” while one
enterprising bookseller, displaying an
undoubted bias, took the process further.
His display for the book read: “Unique
Publishing Feat — While they last! —
Autographed copies, two for one cent
— Plain copies, one cent each —
Extended Credit Facilities Available.”
THE OPERA OPERATION
IT MIGHT be coincidence, but since
the appointment of opera-loving
Stephen (“Don’t misquote me or I’ll
hit you”) Hall as the Elizabethan
Trust’s co-ordinating executive, plans
for the 1969 opera season have under-
gone changes. Proposals for costly pro-
ductions of Mozart’s “Cosi Fan Tutte”
and Pizzetti’s little-known “Murder in
the Cathedral” have been dropped. The
full program, to be announced officially
soon, is: “Falstaff” (to be produced by
Tito Gobbi, who will appear with it
in Melbourne only), “Ballo in Mas-
chera,” “Madame Butterfly” (produced
by Sir Robert Helpmann), “School for
Fathers” and “Boris Godounov” (which
is the last-minute replacement for
“Murder in the Cathedral”). Talk of
Stephen Hall and Stefan Haag appear-
ing in a Trust season of Gilbert and
Sullivan was just a wildly unfounded
rumor.
DOUBLE-EDGED PATRONAGE
UNDER a recent redrawing of munici-
pal boundaries, the unconventional
Sydney suburb of Paddington is now
part of the somewhat starchy Woollahra
municipality. The relationship isn’t
comfortable and hasn’t been helped by
the terms of Woollahra Council’s 1968
art competition: a $600 prize for trad
art and one of $200 for modern
abstract. The mods of Paddo are indig-
nant. Similar disparities occur at Syd-
ney’s Royal Easter Show, but it is rare
in municipal competitions and particu-
larly odd as Woollahra now encompasses
Gallery A, Stern’s, Bonython’s, Komon’s,
and the new Howell Gallery at Double
Bay — all places where trad art is
hardly dominant.
But then, according to the terms of
its competition, Woollahra Council
hardly seems to have an understanding
about how artists feel. There is one
condition, unprecedented in its grimness,
is enough to dissuade any painter
from participating: if any painting is
unsold or uncollected after a month it
will be destroyed if the council thinks
it is unsalable.
THE AGE OF CHANGE
SINCE WE reported the planning by
the Melbourne “Age” of a new broad-
sheet for Australia’s student-intellectual
audience, its proposed editor, Pete
Steedman, is said to have run into
trouble with his plans to make it more
like an Australian “Esquire” than an
intelligent monthly newspaper. Its
scheduled time of appearance, if it
appears at all, has been put back to
next February.
But the “Age” is, more than ever,
intent on capturing a large slice of the
nation’s intelligentsia as a reading audi-
ence. Its managing director, Ranald
McDonald, has announced that his news-
paper will guarantee the advertising
revenue of every edition of “National
U,” provide a scholarship for a full-
time editor and make “Age” facilities
available.
The student newspaper has described
the terms of the agreement as “gen-
erous,”. but the “Age” is on a pretty
good wicket in being able to offer
advertisers a paper with a guaranteed
circulation of at least 50,000.
Although “National U” claimed the
deal ensured complete editorial inde-
pendence, the thought of an unemployed
Steedman ensconced in the “Age” office
has started speculation as to whether
the “Age” intends to keep its two-
ventures separated.
COOL AND HIGH
JAZZ in Sydney is coolly blowing up
from its cellars to literal and figurative
heights ... to the 600ft.-high Skywalk
on the Australia Square tower, for in-
stance. Begun a month ago as a Friday
night special, to give tourists and
Sydneysiders more than a magnificent
view for their $1 a head elevator ride
to the top, Skywalk jazz sessions have
become so popular that the Tommy
Hare Quintet now plays to as many as
400 customers a time, Wednesday to
Saturday from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m., and
on Sunday from 2.30 to 6 p.m. And
now the Wentworth, the Qantas car-
riage-trade hostelry, is about to begin
Wednesday to Saturday night jazz in
what it calls its Supper Club, which is
a converted half of the fifth floor Garden
Court lounge. For a $2.25 cover charge,
patrons will be able to dance, eat a
light supper, and listen to some of
Australia’s best jazzmen — Don Bur-
rows, George Gollan, Ed Gaston,
Julian Lee.

LOOK WHAT THE
STORM WASHED UP
CATHOLIC GUILT
By NANCY KEESING
A Boat Load of Home Folk. Thea
Astley. Angus & Robertson. $3.25.
THEA ASTLEY is undoubtedly one of
the best novelists writing in Australia
at present no serious student of the
genre will or can disregard her work.
In some ways a new tautness of
style and form this is her best novel.
However, no readership is composed
entirely of serious students other
people must read her admirable,
imaginative, but often cruel pages.
Hitherto her books have had an Aus-
tralian mainland setting of city and
small town merciless as they were,
their readers could identify with, or
recognise at least, .many protagonists
who typified contemporary Western
issues and tension. Often the utter
dreadfulness she described the aridity
of middle-class people in our culture;
their failures of communication, dignity,
and balance was tempered, even
spiced, by the author’s malice and wit.
In the past, too, some of the impact
of Miss Astley’s explosions was
cushioned by a convoluted and some-
times over-involved prose style. For
this she received some adverse criticism.
One had to read her books slowly
whether one relished or disliked pas-
sages like: “The tweed-clad arms in-
terpreted marital love around her
small shoulders which stiffened at once
and pulled back. He experienced
thereupon an illogical sense of injury
synchronised with a heaving fear, as
he lowered himself, white-faced, to the
grass beside her. His lips set in the firm
line they did when he was discovered
at fault.” (“The Well Dressed Ex-
plorer.”)
“A Boat Load of Home Folk” is
Miss Astley’s fifth novel it shows
a clearly discernible alteration in her
work. Both space and time are circum-
scribed to two days on a small Pacific
island. Everyone, even residents, seems
to expect South Seas islands to be
exotic and excessive both as to land-
scape and people. Therefore Thea
Astley can take for granted types of
behaviour and thought which needed
longer explanations in her earlier
novels.
Again, her island is such a backwater
that in one sense the book seems
almost a “period novel.” For instance,
as is common in Miss Astley’s books,
an important figure is a conscience-
racked priest. The factors which pre-
cipitated Father Lake’s crisis are old
and basic. None of the over-aired pre-
occupations of mainland mass media
the Pill, marriage for clergy, etc.
emerge here.
However, the most important change,
and one which will certainly affect
Thea Astley in her future writing, is
in style. Her effects are still often
elaborate (“but eyes moved past her
like a school of fish”), but the whole
is now tamed, controlled, and straight-
forward to read. There is, also, less
leavening of wit. Each character is
precisely impaled on a sharp pin and
little of softness, compassion, or pause
is to be allowed to ameliorate their
(or our) distress as they squirm and,
some of them, die.
For a terrible hurricane lashes the
island. It wrecks the ship which trans-
ported the “boat load,” destroys most
material objects on land, and pitilessly
exposes the people of the book.
Who are they?
Miss Trumper and Miss Paradise are
elderly spinster friends; Father Greely
is the “spiritual investigator” of homo-
sexual Father Lake; Gerald and Kath-
erine Seabrook are bound in drearily
unfaithful matrimony; Stevenson, an
agent, has a painful incurable heart
condition, a broken marriage, and an
impossible dream of love and poetry.
All are guilt-ridden and guilt-pursued.
There are catalytic minor characters
who are not really touched by events,
because they are pivots and do not
Astley ... easier style, same sharp pin
wobble down and up on the scales
Johnny Terope and Marie Latimer are
chief of these.
Whether or not they are Roman
Catholics (and many of the cast are),
all are influenced in one way or another
by Catholicism. After the hurricane
only three important, and symbolic,
buildings are left reasonably intact.
Some people are “skulking in the Glare
Bar, huddled over the counter with
their inner griefs held tight for com-
fort,” but more are listening to the
bishop at his thanksgiving Mass “. . .
this prison and church have been the
only places spared apart from some
of the houses along the lee of the hill.”
The author’s interpretations of Catho-
lic guilt, Catholic gallantry, Catholic
expiation are the core of the book. And
to this list must, I think, be added
Catholic cruelty, for when I search in
my mind for other writers so prepared
to make “Aunt Sally” use of their
characters (though often with more
compassion) it is Catholic authors, in
recent fiction, who suggest themselves.
I am not, of course, saying that all
Catholic writers are cruel or that all
are preoccupied with Catholic dilemmas
many have completely different sub-
ject matter and approaches. But there
is a large body of fiction both here and
overseas which is so imbued with guilt
and spiritual discussion that, even when
it is satirical, it runs pei uously close to
the tiresome for non-Catholic readers.
UP AND AWAY-AY-AY!
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Sword and the Myrtle. Richard
Beilby. Angus & Robertson. $4.50.
The Horsemen. Joseph Kessel. Arthur
Barker. $3.90.
BOTH THESE novels are what used
to be known as rattling good adventure
stories, the kind that used to be given
to nice uncles for Christmas. Well
written and well constructed, they rely
more on unusual and exotic settings,
on local color, and on strange cus-
toms for their interest rather than on
any strikingly outstanding literary
merits. In a sense, they are both cloak-
and-dagger historicals “The Sword
and the Myrtle,” chronologically, being
set in ancient Greece; “The Horsemen,”
anachronistically, being set in
“modern” Afghanistan, which appears
to have scarcely changed since
Genghis Khan slept there.
“The Sword and the Myrtle” gains
added interest through being a first
novel by a new Perth author, whose
accounts of famous battles like Ther-
mopylae and Salamis ring with the
authentic echoes of his own ex-
periences when fighting there, centuries
later, with the AIF in World War 11.
Richard Beilby has a gift for vivid
verbal landscape painting, for evok-
ing an atmosphere, and for drawing
unspoken parallels between then and
now, between old gods and new, be-
tween fifth-column plotting and the
enemy within, both past and present.
If it all seems a bit on the Techni-
color side, with star human-interest
parts specially written in for Greek
Olympic charioteer Charlton Heston
and his maty rival in war the Persian
Yul Brunner, the actual historical
background seems factually well
researched. Toward the end, the
author seems to find it more difficult
to sustain the tension, and resorts to
an increasing number of exclamation
marks (my top score was 11 on one
page), often where they have no

grammatical business to be. But, by the
time-renowned device of introducing
a supposed Greek renegade as spy into
Xerxes’ advancing armies, he manages,
skilfully, to let the reader both run
with the Medes and fight with the
Spartans.
Bernard Knight deserves a mention,
too, for his striking red, black, and
brown frieze-like cover design.
“The Horsemen” is perhaps more
subtle in its interplay of human
emotions and relationships. Its main
theme is the stiff-necked besetting sin
of pride which turns a love-hate bond
between a too-alike father and son into
a complicated game of onedownman-
ship. Joseph Kessel reveals the Asiatic-
Moslem mentality from the inside. He
shows how the other half thinks,
Beilby ... old gods and new
reasons, and acts. Too many East-West
relations have foundered on the failure
to appreciate this inbuilt dichotomy.
Rather than be defiled by a foreign
female nurse, the son, who is a famous
player in the Royal Buzkashi (an old
contest of steppe horsemen), leaves his
hospital bed, removes his plaster cast,
and, with his leg broken, rides for days
across the lonely mountains of Afghani-
stan to his home.
The story is an account of this
journey, w'hich is both physical and
spiritual, showing how fine a line there
is between courage and stupidity,
daring and lack of imagination, ignor-
ance and innocence. This one is only
for uncles with strong stomachs, for
the nauseating stench of the rotting
wound gradually permeates the book,
the various stages of gangrene are
faithfully described, and the piece de
resistance is the amputation without
anaesthetic.
The closest I ever came to Afghani-
stan was when my husband and I once
found ourselves sharing a carriage on
the Rome Express with its ex-King
Amman Ullah and a quantity of sticky
sweetmeats. From ,my recollection of
that occasion, I should say that Joseph
Kessel obviously knows his Afghans.
CERTAIN IMPERFECTIONS

National Gallery of Victoria: Painting,

hard.) 132 pages. $9.50.

color pages. Introduction, Patrick
McCaughey. $2.50.
AS YOU MIGHT expect, books like
Dr. Hoff’s and Miss Plant’s and Mr.
Mollison’s, which mingle scholarship’
promotion, and didacticism, tend to
waver in the emphasis given their varied
aims. 4he Cheshire book is a good
introduction to and reminder of much
of what may be seen at Victoria’s
gallery, but the treasures before the 15th
century and the splendors of the decor-
ative arts are omitted. The sensible in-
troduction is rather too defensive about
the gaps in the gallery’s collection; as
the bulk of the book is concerned with
the discussion of individual works in
reproduction, the introduction deals with
styles and schools and, therefore, gives
undue attention to minor pieces like
Chagall s “adorful” gouaches and their
only original Picasso, a drawing, while
Pollaiuolo’s great etching Battle of the
Nudes is summarily dealt with as re-
flecting “the artist’s interest in anatomy
and in classical antiquity and his use of
line.”
In the rest of the book a page of
text faces a reproduction, and it is
refreshing to find someone talking about
the actual work of art, but too often
the authors describe what is all too
obvious, though, for example, the
treatment of Wyndham Lewis’ Inferno
and Blake’s Antaeus does revealingly
associate aesthetic purpose with pictorial
reportage. In a book obviously aimed
at the “intelligent layman,” it is strange
that the simplest treatment is given to
familiar styles, while the moderns are
often described in the cliches and
jargon of criticism; further, the stimu-
lating and probing approach accorded,
for example, to Klee or Jeff Smart uses
a terminology that is not applied to
traditional works of art; one wonders if
different aesthetic canons are being
used for different eras. Certainly some
of the notes are aesthetically irrelevant,
but the public, which simply craves
for factual information, may be set on
the right path by learning that orchards
bloom in Conder but never in Roberts.
Though the text is best when it is
comparative, plates are rarely placed
so that pictorial comparisons can be
made, and in such a didactic volume
it seems, for example, pointless to com-
pare Olsen with Dubuffet, whose work
is not in the Gallery, and not with
Appel, whose work is. The black-and-
white (that is, grey on grey) plates are
misty and lack definition and density;
the color plates vary enormously, but

are fine with Blackman, Brack, and de
Stael (surely the de Stael background
is red and not orange as the text says),
and disastrous with Van Dyck’s Countess
of Southampton, who becomes a flashy
Victorian prima donna. For such
an educational work the Melbourne-
oriented bibliography is unforgivably
skimpy and oddly balanced: why
mention books on Appel and Bacon
but not on Sutherland, Tapies, and the
Thames and Hudson work on Nolan
and Drysdale? When Norbert Lynton’s
“The Modern World” (Hamlyn)
arrives in Australia, readers and writers
will have a model of opposite, inter-
pretative, and analytic comment.
Fred Williams’ oil paintings are such
distinguished interpretations of the
local landscapes that a book on his
etchings is like having a critical
anthology of the poems of Thomas
Hardy or George Meredith before any
assessment of their novels had appeared.
Even if this is an Australian innovation,
like the signed comment by Daniel
Thomas used as a dustjacket blurb, one
wonders why the minor modes of
distinguished European and American
moderns cannot be found within hard
covers, or soft, for that matter. Why
do we need this beautifully produced
book? Some of the etchings are tense
and telling, others blotty and repetitive;
no attempt is made to “place” Wil-
liams among modern etchers; John
Brack thinks that etching gave disci-
pline to Williams’ early “farouche”
paintings, but I incline to think that
Matisse and Cezanne and, more
recently, oriental paintings provided
the discipline. In any case, one could
hardly justify the book for what it tells
us about works it does not deal with.
Mollison’s meticulous research has
been much commended; I find it
antiquarian and pedantic. It is
antiquarian in that it is for connois-
seurs and archivists and not for art-
historians who are concerned with
genesis, influences, reception, and social
impact; it is pedantic since it records
minute changes in plates (called
“states”) without mentioning their
significance. Actually, the pedantry fails,
because the appendix reproductions are
so small that the changes cannot be
seen; where is the vertical line in State
111 of plate 66? There are other prob-
lems: if etching is one of the arts of
reproduction, what are we to think of
the 11 variations in the 67 prints from
plate 63? What the aesthetician wants
are prints from the various states of a
plate alongside one another in order
to obtain some notion of the artist’s
quest. What we really get is a list of
significant characteristics as though each
etching were the result of identikit
processes. Mollison’s useful glossary of
terms adds to the air of pedantry; lists
of techniques and ingredients hardly
answer the question of what Williams
had done as an etcher.
Brack inclines to the view that the
works speak for themselves; Patrick
McCaughey’s introduction to the Cen-
tral Street publication speaks up for
the new abstraction, and the plates,
which lift out separately, do speak for
themselves, even if echoes of
McCaughey’s views are heard as you
look at them. The folder records two
years of achievement and combines
promotion of a style and proselytisation
without pretension and irrelevance; and
it’s refreshingly democratic, as no artist
is promoted more than another.

Lit from within like lanterns
Through hushing leaves we pass
Across the yielding face
Of our tender blue planet
Vulnerable, sentient,
Scored home of birds, beasts, men,
Insects, plants, The moon
Symbol of otherness
And perfect barrenness
Faintly scars the sky
Its glaring basalt day
Tamed by our depth of air.
To feel the silent roar
The shrivelling solar wind
Eclipse of flesh and mind
Snatch one away, to fall
Lurching through that black hole
Endless, swarming with stars,
To see the robed world pause
Whorled, glittering; swing away
In warm grass where I lie
A spider rears to claim
My offered leafstem
A ladybird explores
My thumb, hesitates, draws
Herself together, splays
Her orange shards, and flies.

REVALORIZING POUND
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
Ezra Pound. Michael Reck. Rupert
Hart-Davis. $5.05.
THERE WAS A number of oracles for
the modern movement in English
poetry, but the man who really set the
party going is Ezra Pound. Of that
group, which he helped set in motion,


Eliot, Williams, e. e. cummings, and
Yeats in his later phase, Pound is the
last survivor, like Ulysses washed up
alone at the end, and now as blind as
his idol Homer was in the legend.
The number of writers whom Pound
helped or influenced is phenomenal. He
had an eagle-eye for talent, encourag-
ing the young Eliot and Hemingway,
raking up assistance for an unknown
James Joyce, drawing attention to the
work of an obscure forty-year-old
Robert Frost. At a crucial phase in
Yeats’ life he worked as Yeats’ secre-
tary and played a critical part in the
development of Yeats’ later poetry.
Pound, in an early poem entitled “The
Lake Isle,” took a swipe at Yeats’ “Lake
Isle of Innisfree” and expressed yearn-
ings for a little tobacco shop “with the
little bright boxes piled up neatly on
the shelves' instead, of course, of Yeats’
“small cabin ... of clay and wattles
made.”
With a friendly and caustic intelli-
gence, Pound moulded the work of a
whole generation of writers. The faults
and virtues of his generation can be
traced to their fountainhead in his work
and personality. Without Pound one
cannot imagine the new vigorous trans-
lations of the Latin and Greek classics
which have completely transformed our
appreciation of ancient literature.
“Homage to Sextus Propertius” and
other early works of Pound took the
solemnity out of the classics, made them
sharp, gay, and irreverent.
Robert Graves may have wanted to
have Pound executed for treason at the
end of World War 11, but one won-
ders whether Graves’ very fine trans-
lations and the translations of Arrow-
smith and C. Day Lewis would be as
they are now if Pound had not done
the initial spadework and let air into
the language. Pound’s marvellous
translations of Li Po have helped to
make Chinese poetry accessible to the
English reader. Pound himself, as Reck
points out in this book, was a com-
parative ignoramus when it came to
Chinese scholarship. Reck, when he
had studied Chinese at Harvard for
half a year was approached by Achilles
Fang, the eminent sinologist and
admirer of Pound, one day in the
library and Fang said, “Now you know
more Chinese than Pound” —then strode
off.
Reck writes: “The Cantos, allusive
and multilingual, are an incitation to
learning. It should not be supposed that
the poet claims expertise in all the
areas to which he refers and all the
languages he cites. He simply wants
the reader to be as curious as he
himself has been. A passage from the
Thrones section is illuminating:
“1 shall have to learn a little greek to
keep up with this but so will you, drratt
you.”
Pound saw himself primarily as an
educator and much of the obscurity
of his poetry derives from a desire to
educate his readers, to make them look
up the sources which he quotes, and
read about the historical figures who
people the pages of the Cantos, and rub
shoulders with mathematical formulae
and descriptions of mountain lakes.
Surely few books on economic theory
could have as many percentage signs as
there are in the Cantos.
Pound wielded tremendous influence
over T. S. Eliot. Looking at Pound’s
“Ripostes,” published in 1912, one dis-
covers “Portrait d’une Femme” which
is the obvious source of Eliot’s “Por-
trait of a Lady.” In the same volume is
Pound’s translation of “The Sea-Farer”
which heavily influenced Eliot’s “The
Dry Salvages.” In both cases, however,
Eliot has, I feel, tunnelled the vein
much deeper than Pound was able to.
It is interesting also to compare the
poems in “Lustra” with the poetry of
Pound, after his release in 1958
the great modern Greek poet C. P.
Cavafy. A poem such as “Arides” who
“married an ugly wife, He was bored
with his manner of life . . . He went
to his doom” is almost perfect Cavafy.
Cavafy was considerably older than
Pound, so it seems unlikely that Pound
was an influence on Cavafy. At the time
“Lustra” was published Pound could
not possibly have known Cavafy’s work.
But the similarity is there, in poem after
poem. “Lustra” reveals Pound’s weak-
ness when compared with Cavafy.
Cavafy, as an Alexandrian, bears the
mantle of the Byzantine and Greek
civilisation which he writes about much
more naturally than Pound, whose
Graeco-Roman poems by comparison
are those of an interloper.
Cavafy’s poetry has a coherence and
concentration which Pound lacks.
Pound writes as an American, a Proven-
cal, a Chinese, and a Roman by turns
and sometimes simultaneously. Pound
disliked bland, cosmopolitan civilis-
ation, which is why he writes so often
in dialect or his own personal “Pound-
ese.” One wonders, however, whether
his constant jumps from language to
language produced the very cosmopoli-
tanism he wished to avoid. His wish to
bring together oriental and occidental
cultures, which lies at the heart of the
Cantos, is in conflict with other parts
of his personality.
Yeats’ dramatis personae is compara-
tively small. If you go to the trouble
of learning a little about Lady Gregory
and Maud Gonne and a few others,
most of the personal references in Yeats’
poetry can be unravelled. However,
Pound, because of his lack of concen-
tration, has a rogues’ gallery which is
stupefyingly vast. Anyone reading
Reek’s study will glean some facts about
the Cantos which will make it a bit
easier to read, but for me it is still a
gigantic Chinese puzzle with a few very
beautiful passages.
Alexander Pope in “The Rape of The
Lock ’ managed to have as many refer-
ences to the line as Pound has in “The
Cantos.” With Pope, however, ignor-
ance of these references does not stop me
from enjoying the poem. With Pound,
knowledge of the references is generally
necessary for appreciation of the work.
Reck makes no bones about some of
Pound’s deficiencies. He tells the story
of Pound’s visit to Mussolini. Pound
recorded their conversation in the first
line of Canto 41.
“Ma questo,”
said the Boss, “e divertente,”
catching the point before the aesthetes
had got there.
. Mussolini or “the Boss” was refer-
ring to a draft of the Cantos on his
desk before him and announced politely
“This is entertaining!” Pound mistook a
casual comment for a profound insight
into his Cantos. Mussolini, with a mini-
mal knowledge of English, would almost
certainly have been nonplussed by
them.
Sometimes Reek’s partisanship of
Pound is excessive. At times he seems
to blame our society for Pound’s years
of poverty in Italy, when he received
no literary awards or assistance of any
type whatever. If Pound chose to live
in Italy this was Pound’s decision.
Obviously if Pound had returned to
the United States in the 1930 s he would
have received assistance from univers-
ities and similar organisations. It was
not society which was agin Pound, it
was Pound who was agin society, and
that is the way Pound wanted it.
After Pound’s release from a mental
asylum in the United States, where he
was incarcerated because of his broad-
casts for Mussolini, Pound became
very depressed, Reck records. It is
typical of Pound that while he was
incarcerated under appalling conditions
by a government that he hated, he was
quite light-hearted. As soon as he was
tolerated he became depressed.
Ultimately Pound remains a mystery,
a contradiction. He is a great elucidator,
a great source of clarity, yet also a
master of confusion and crankiness. He
is a peculiarly 20th-century success and
failure.

LOVE POTIONS
FROM
THE KITCHEN
TO ME love and food are almost
inextricably linked.
The first time I fell in love I recall
most vividly. I was about five years
old and staying with my grand-
father in Sweden while my parents were
travelling around Europe. My grand-
father had been widowed early in life
and his housekeeper had brought up
his two daughters, and when they
married she remainded to care for him.
She was, I recall, a small, birdlike
woman, stiffly starched and firmly
dedicated to the idea of “eating what is
good for you.”
Eating was not, at the time, one of
my greatest joys. Nursery food is never
exactly exciting and it becomes even
less so when you are threatened with
dire remarks of “eat it or you will waste
to a shadow by the time your mother
returns.”
Eventually my grandfather, con-
stantly reminded of my imminent fate
by his housekeeper, decided to do some-
thing about it. On the pretext of taking
me for a walk, he led me to his favorite
restaurant, where he lunched every day
of his life: undoubtedly this place was
responsible for his happy disposition.
I vividly recall the room: white
tablecloths, bent waiters solicitously
hovering over seemingly hundreds of
people, all busily munching.
My grandfather ordered, and I sat
patiently waiting for food which 1
didn’t want to be set in front of me;
food that would have to be forced
down. This was the first time that a
gentleman had taken me out to eat, and
I was sufficiently feminine to know that
I had to make the most of it or it
might never happen again.
I can recall that meal to this day.
Later we took a carriage home and I
recall jogging along under an avenue
of trees with a thick rug over my small
knees, both of us looking very smug.
When I refused to eat my dinner that
night, the housekeeper again complained
to my grandfather. “The child will not
waste away,” he said, “she tucked into
a whole bowl of Russian caviar, ate
a whole lobster thermidor, and finished
that off with a hot orange souffle, which
she enjoyed so much that I let her eat
mine, too.”
I don’t know where that old chest-
nut first fell the way to a man’s
heart is through bis stomach but
I must confess that it works for girls,
too.
I have been wooed, I’,m happy to
say, in many ways, and some of the
most successful were through my turn.
The first love of my life was a naval
officer a whole eleven years older than
I. A bon vivant if ever there was one.
He owned a superb little house in
Kensington, which was furnished like
an ad in “House and Garden.” Next
to the bedroom the kitchen was his
favorite room. He prepared a mean
eggs benedict after a cocktail party
that could melt any girl’s heart.
If you have a gay blade for a son,
you may care to pass on the recipe
for eggs benedict. Husbands can also
be tempted with these for a late Sun-
day morning breakfast. Serve it to
him in bed once his eyes are open.
Poach lightly two eggs per person.
Meanwhile fry until golden in butter
a thick slice of white bread, without
crust, per egg. Place on paper towel
to absorb excess fat and spread thickly
with good pate, top with a slice of
ham, and sit the poached egg on top
of that. Into a saucepan, over a low
flame, place one tablespoon of good
mayonnaise per egg; add one table-
spoon of dry sherry per two table-
spoons of mayonnaise, stir lightly, and,
when warm, pour over poached eggs.
There is a saying that Latins make
lousy lovers. Then why is it that every
year literally thousands of girls,
attached and single, travel along the
Mediterranean coast and return, usually
having left more than their heart
behind them?
The ,men who grow up along the
sunny coast of this beautiful part of
the world may not be the most faith-
ful husbands on this planet, but, by
golly, they know how to make a woman
feel like a woman.
I was once wooed by such. He
cut a dash in the drawing-room, had
an excellent reputation in the bedroom,
and his savoir-faire in the kitchen has
since been surpassed by none.
In view of the fact that I fancy my-
self particularly in the latter, our
association became one of challenge
and I’m happy to say that neither of
us was defeated. The recipes he taught
me never came out of a book. He main-
tained that preparing good food was a
labor of love.
As his lobster thermidor was a
memorable experience, let me pass it
on to you: it is simple enough to pre-
pare and nectar to eat.
Split cooked lobsters in half length-
wise. Remove meat from the shells,
cut into cubes, and dry shell with a
clean cloth. Crack all claws and empty
the meat and juice. Prepare I pint
of bechamel sauce with cream instead
of milk; season with 1 tablespoon of
french mustard, freshly ground black
pepper, salt, and a dash of cayenne.
Add a glass of sherry, stir in prepared
lobster, and heat through. Fill lobster
shells with mixture, sprinkle lightly
with grated parmesan cheese, dust with
paprika, and dot with butter. Place
under grill to brown. To serve, flame
with brandy when bringing to the
table.
So we don’t have lobsters in Aus-
tralia crayfish will do just as well.
But, for goodness’ sake, please don’t
serve it with rice and peas, than which
there is surely no more unromantic
combination of vegetables.

Australia's art
Your article on a cultural meta-
morphosis at Canberra (8., Sept. 21)
serves no advance purpose unless Aus-
tralia is to analyse the lack of pene-
tration of its art abroad. Some Aus-
tralians earn recognition as expatriate
artists, but no one domiciled here is
accepted overseas because his country
is a generative base, as is the case with
artists who live in places like London
and New York and exhibit elsewhere.
Unless it is the resolve of the Govern-
ment that our artists achieve this
parity, it is wasting public money if
it merely repeats in Canberra what
the States have done already.
Australia, despite the local activity,
holds a lowly place as' an art* nation.
It has surprised many to find that,
in 1962, the Tate Gallery did not make
its special-event admission charge for
the Australian exhibition sponsored
abroad by our Government, because
people in London lacked the interest
to see a group show from this country.
In fact, there is antipathy in art circles
in Europe toward Australia. This is a
relic of the Menzies era.
Australian art, as a result, is unknown
in Europe; and when it goes in group
shows, now belatedly, to the U.S.A.
(as did the Mertz collection), the
critics there deride it as emulative.
Only by candid reassessment of re-
peated showings in the best galleries
abroad does a nation’s art acquire the
specific virtues. Yet officials at Can-
berra are not keen to see our artists
accept this discipline, but have switched
to showing them in trade fairgrounds
where there are no criteria.
With the prospect of a new gallery
at Canberra, one could expect more
resilience from our art advisers. In-
stead, we find that when Australia was
invited by the Mexican Government to
send the work of painters to a grand
exhibition of culture, current with the
Olympiad, she again opted out.

Defending John Barraclough
I found Daphne Guinness’ dreary little
piece of sad spring fun both inaccurate
and unacceptable when it referred to
John Barraclough. What, one wonders,
does a young hardworking politician
do in the circumstances? Apart, of
course, from regretting bitterly that he
had ever agreed to an interview with
Miss Guinness in the first place. There
is really very little any David can
achieve against the Goliath of Consoli-
dated Press but perhaps an apology
over the name of the editor of The
Bulletin might help.

The Rhodesia lobby
Your article “Looking for a Lobby”
attempts to show that the “Rhodesia
Lobby” consists of no more than three
Federal MPs. I have been in contact
with a considerable number of Govern-
ment backbenchers and I can assure
you that support for Rhodesia in the
Federal Parliament is far greater than
you are prepared to admit.
You point out that in fact only
two Government MPs have been pre-
pared to vigorously support action
against Rhodesia. Of these, only Mr.
St. John has supported sanctions ouc
of a belief that what Rhodesia is doing
is wrong and on most issues he
could not by the widest stretch of the
imagination be taken to be representa-
tive of the Liberal Party thinking.
The N.S.W. Liberal Party and Young
Liberal Movement have called for the
re-establishment of normal trade rela-
tions with Rhodesia. In the N.S.W. State
Parliament, support for Rhodesia is
nothing less than overwhelming. Several
State Ministers are, in fact, patrons of
the various Rhodesia associations.

The IPA and industry
Much of the criticism of the new IPA
booklet (8., Sept. 21) “Better Living
Standards The Key Is Productivity”
is unfair. The author of the article
contends that the booklet exhibits a
lack of understanding of industrial
psychology and ignores the primary
responsibility of employers themselves
for achieving productivity improve-
ments. But the booklet states, “It
(productivity) is a matter of respon-
sible, intelligent, enterprising work,
whether by a managing director or a
lad on the factory floor . . . Big
advances can come from better organis-
ation of work, better production
methods, more skilful management.”
The booklet is intended to be no-
more than a piece of general education
on the relationship between better
living standards and higher produc-
tivity, and the special importance of
the latter if Australia is to achieve its
national goals. It aims to bring about a
wider understanding of this simple but
vital truth by statistical demonstration
of what has happened in the past and
by comparisons of living standards in
different countries.
What the booklet is trying to do is
to establish a general climate of under-
standing in which efforts to improve
productivity are likely to have a better
chance of success. In this regard we
agree with the author of your article
that these efforts must come mainly
from employers; at the same time the
tremendously important part played by
public attitudes, and also national
economic policy in the preservation of
incentives and the avoidance of
inflationary pressures, must count.
A review of the Institute’s activities
by the respected American newspaper
the “Christian Science Monitor,” of
Boston, stated, among other things, “In
addition to exercising a big influence in
shaping thinking in high places in Aus-
tralia, the IPA has done much to
combat the ignorance, prejudice, and
deliberately anti-democratic propa-
ganda that has dogged Australian
industrial relations. Certainly a great
change has come in this sphere of public
thought, greater peace, more harmony,
more understanding. To the IPA must
go much of the credit.”
All this makes nonsense of the
implied assertion in The Bulletin article
that the IPA is contemptuous of such
matters as industrial psychology and
the social sciences.
