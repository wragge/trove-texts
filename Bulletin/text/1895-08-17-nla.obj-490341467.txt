A BELATED BOOK.
A memory of hastily-scanned chapters in Har-
per’s fathered the suggestion in this column, a
week or two ago, that “ Trilby ” might be “dull.”
That is the last thing which should be said of it.
Author and reader enjoy a camaraderie which
puts tedium out of the question. Certainly the
fascination fades in the last half, where the
machine-gods perspire at their labor, and pathos
and humor grow middle-aged along with the char-
acters ; but the book can be read to the end with-
out much trouble —and the first half is delicious.
English has no other picture of Paris Bohemian-
ism to equal this, though Thackeray has caught
the atmosphere here and there. It is not a pic-
ture to hang on the line—not at all a formal story
—just a vivid, natural sketch which glows and
breathes and charms you. So far as there is a
plot, the personages make it as they go along, and
the interest clusters always around them, not
round their deeds. The air of the Latin Quarter
may have changed in the gone half-century ; but
it does not matter. Du Maurier’s tints are real;
if the so-called reality cannot match those brilliant
reds and blues, so much the worse for the grey and
drab reality.
Whether “Trilby” deserves all her vogue is
another matter; probably she doesn’t; certainly
her vogue will pass, if it has not passed already.
Her poetic feet cannot make her a classic, even a
pseudo-classic. Her voice is better —the descrip-
tion of her wonderful powers fills some of the most
effective pages in the book; but “Ouida” is at
least as good when lavishing similes on the voice
of Oorreze. It is the studio scenes and chat which
one is thankful for—with Trilby only a figure, not
the central figure, and the priggish Little Billee
surrounded by so many foils that he has not time
to be heavy and objectionable.
Du Maurier’s knowledge is well seconded by his
styles—it might be truer to reverse the statement.
His should be the triolet’s motto—“sans peser, sans
rester ” —with such an air of incorrigible butterfly
does he flutter from paragraph to paragraph ! He
is spirited, and unaffected, and breezy, and easy,
and handles his pen as freely as his pencil—more
freely, perhaps.
A word to readers. “ Trilby ” isn’t good, solid,
fictional roast beef; it isn’t exciting; it wants a just-
a-little-cultured palate to appreciate it fully. If
you can’t make a meal off cheese and salad
and a bottle of light wine—the salad oiled
with a liberal sprinkling of French phrases—
better stick to people with reliable plots. Du
Maurier does, indeed, kill off four or his chief
figures at the close; but the killing is rather
clumsy, and the blood doesn’t make an attractive
mess on the carpet.
Australians get “Trilby” in a very good illus-
trated edition —paper, 35.; cloth, 4s.
NOTES.
The Bulletin Magazine is now well under
weigh, and the first number should make the port
of publication in a few weeks. It will contain
about 48 pages of prose, verse, and illustrations,
chosen from the best in The Bulletin repertory,
with possibly a new feature or two. The size will
be somewhat reduced from that of The Bulletin.
“ The Banjo’s ” book of verse will probably see
light about the end of this month; and Henry
Lawson’s verse should follow it before the end of
next. His prose tales and sketches will come in
another volume a little later. Daley’s book is
still in the clouds.
Ethel Turner’s new book will reach Australia in
another month or so. * * Seven Little Australians ”
has sold well in this country ; but, so far, hardly as
well as was anticipated in England or America.
However, there is plenty of time; for juvenile
books are almost independent of “seasons.” It
is interesting to note that there is nearly as much
difference of critical opinion regarding the death
of Judy as touching that of “ little Nell.” Coul-
son Kemahan, Ward, Lock and Bowden’s
“ reader,” whose “ Dead Man’s Diary ” and other
works are sufficient proof of his literary capacity,
is affected almost to tears when the big tree
falls. Others say they feel the jar of false senti-
ment and bad art. When critics disagree, it is
lucky that the author has decided beforehand.
Wilkie Collins’ “ Moonstone,” which rivals
“ The Woman in White ” in power and interest,
will also be obtainable shortly in a cheap edition.
Olive Schreiner (Mrs. Cronwrlght) recently gave
birth to a girl, which only lived a few hours. How
jioor woman pays for genius !
All the wholesale booksellers declare that
nothing goes better in Australia than Mrs. Henry
Wood’s novels—especially “ East Lynne,” which
.-ells every day. This is the more surprising, as
these books are only issued at 6s. —a price gener-
al'y too high for good Australian trade. But,
when you go into middle-class homes, you will
almost'certainly find “East Lynne,” or “The
Channings,” or “Mrs. Haliburton’s Troubles,”
among the half-dozen volumes which the mistress
of the house specialises as her own. Mrs. Wood,
in fact, is the favorite woman’s-novelist. She is
moral, yet not too moral, but just moral enough ;
and she spices her sanctity with a substantial thrill,
hither authors, like Miss Braddon, can give the
dear ladies the sex-stimulant which they crave ;
others, like Edna Lyall, can give them the con-
.scieuce-sedative which they need ; but none has
ever so well as Mrs. Wood combined stimulant
and sedative, naughty “nip” and hypocritical
peppermint, in a single delicious draught.
Grant Allan has dramatised “The Woman Who
Did.”
Mrs. Humphry Ward’s new tale, “The Story of
Bessie Costrell,” will be to hand this month.
The original of Kipling’s “Mulvaney” is said
to be a certain William' M‘Manus, now of Ban
Francisco, ami formerly in the British Army.
M ' Manus remembers K ipling well, and describee
him as “a plucky, inquisitive little fellow with a
short, stubby black moustache and specs., who
used to pass the bottle round freely among the
m-ivates. and pump out of .us all the yarns of the
Larrack-room. ’
Miss Dunne, “George Egerton,” of “Keynotes”
tune, is now alleged to have been born in Mel-
bourne. With two editions of 50b0 each, her first
and best book *an be counted as successful com-
mercially as it is in a literary sense.

PUBLICATIONS.
“ The Australian Slang Dictionary ” (paper,
Is. 3d.), by Cornelius Crowe, is an amazingly
ignorant production. The author has mixed an
olla-podrida of linguistic scraps picked up every-
where—most of which are either not Australian or
not slang—and enriched it with little bits of his
own. The spelling is atrocious, and the defini-
tions are worse— e.g., “Pyjands, a kind of loose
drawers;” “Axe to grind, disseminating (!) for
personal ends ; ” and so on. The collection, how-
ever, is not without interest —one likes to know
that “ japanned by the Salvos ” means “ converted
by the Salvation Army ; ” it has a good deal of
unconscious humor —■“ bubble company ”is defined
as “ land and mining syndicates; ” and it will
doubtless find the readers it deserves.
Three new books in the handsome “ Keynotes ”
series (cloth, 4s. 6d. each), are “ Women’s
Tragedies,” by H. D. Lowry; “Monochromes,”
by Ella D’Arcy; and “Grey Roses,” by Henry
Harland. All three are worth buying, though
possession of literary tastes improves their flavor:
the two latter are largely compiled from “The
Yellow Book.” Mr. Lowry has, perhaps, the
greatest gift of dramatic presentment; though
Ella D’Arcy runs him close. This new writer
does characteristic woman’s work, exhibiting a
fine emotional cleverness, but her limitations are
obvious and never overpassed. Henry Harland’s
characteristics are an easy, graceful style, cosmo-
politan fluency, amid a knack of interesting us in
sentimental pictures of modern life seen from a
thoroughly modern point of view.
Morier’s “Adventures of Hajji Baba” is re-
issued by Macmillan in a very nice cloth edition,
well illustrated (45.). This hook, though thrown
into narrative form, is really one of the classics of
travel, and gives a quite unique picture of Persian
life and character. Another good old book in the
same seines is “Tom Cringle’s Log” (45.), a
splendid sea romance whose tang and gusto Time
has vainly tried to stale.
One of the best and most readable books about
China is Chester Holcombe’s recently-published
“ The Real Chinaman ’’(cloth, Bs.), adorned by many
good photo-illustrations. The author, an Ameri-
can, was for many years secretary to the U.S.
Legation at Peking, and reads the riddle of the
Mongolian sphinx by the light of a knowledge
which' few other Westerners have attained to.
The book is unusually well worth its price.
Vols. 3 and 4 of the re-issue of the “Author’s
Favorite ” edition of the Waverley novels—“ Guy
Mannering ” —are now to hand (cloth, 2s. 6d.).
The handy size and neat typography of this edition
(which contains all the original engravings) have
already been commended.
“ Studies of Men ” (cloth, 10s. 6d.), by G. W.
Smalley, is almost an ideal illustration of gossipy,
personal journalism, and most pleasant reading.
The subjects are many and various.
Anthony Hope’s new novel, “A Change of
Air” (cloth, Gs. 6d.), reaches his latter level, and
is readable enough.
George Moore’s “Celibates” (cloth, 6s. 6d.), is a
series of character studies in which the author’s
toucli, always a little heavy, crushes out most of
the interest of his subjects in the effort to make
them true.
“The Ameer Abdur Rahman” (cloth, 45.),
by S. E. Wheeler, can be cordially recommended
as an up-to-date and graphic sketch of Afghan
men and affairs.
In his monograph on “Louis XIV.” (cloth, ss.
6d.) Arthur Hassall gives a very good and readable
account of the French monarchy at the zenith of
its power.
“The Ruined Cities of Mashonaland ” (cloth,
45.), by J. T. Bent, is a new and interesting book
of African travel.
Webster’s “ Book of Beekeeping ” (Is. 3d.) can
be recommended to amateurs and beginners.
Baddeley’s “Lawn Tennis” (Is. 3d.) is a good
little manual, with records and wrinkles up to ’94.
83T NOTE.— As most of the books men-
tioned are in strong demand, some may
be temporarily out of stock. In such
case, orders will be filed, and the books
forwarded immediately on arrival of next
shipment.
Any book not in this list will be for-
warded on receipt of price, particulars
of which will he given to enquirers.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
OHmS A ND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
uuivED BY Hearnes Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful _ under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill_ with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now, I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it ; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
-Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“ Dear Sir, —I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

QURSE L V E SI
We wish it to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely inclusive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS,
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life —honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
never cease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

A GOLDEN SHANTY,
ELLEAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Your face is with me yet—
I loved you so—
Sweet, tender, sad regret
Of long ago !
Time cannot dim your eyes.
The old-time grace—
Each look in loving-wise—
I still can trace ;
Still see the sweet, faint flush
That once I saw.
When Love first made you blush
In days of yore;
When ’neath the scented vine
You stole unseen.
And kissed me, and were mine.
My lost Ellean!
There, murmuring each to each,
’Neath listening boughs,
In passion-shaken speech
We made our vows;
And though the years’ grey ghosts
Throng thick between,
They cannot steal from me
That night, Ellean 1
I wonder if the breeze
That kissed your hair.
Beneath the arbor trees,
Still seeks you there ;
Seeks through the roses round
To find a red
To match the lips caressed
In nights long dead.
It never shall be found
And ne’er has been
Since the last night of all—
Of all—Ellean !
• • • • •
Ah ! I would fain forget.
If that might be,
The sorrow and regret
In thoughts of thee ;
For when the lips of one
Who loves me now
Press as I felt yours press
So long ago,
I see two great sad eyes
Rise up between,
And know I loved but once—
Loved you, Ellean !
And when at night I lie
Awake—alone—
I hear the tremulous sigh,
The tender tone,
Whose music sways my soul
As some strong wind
Sways whispering leaves ; but when
They bring to mind
“The saddest thought of all,
What might have been,”
I wish that 1 were dead
Like you, Ellean !

BURON GRAHAM.
“I lately saw a queer prospecting party
start from a Westraliau town (writes a Bulletin
correspondent). There were four—father and son
(Dutchmen), a mouthy English youngster about
19, and a sailor who was to be a sort of man
Friday. None of them had ever been in the bush
before, so they equipped themselves for all
emergencies. They have 10 eases of tinned soup,
fish, meat, and vegetables ; 10 guns and rifles, 10
revolvers, C saddles, 3 cane couches, 3 stone water-
bottles, and various items too numerous to men-
tion, including 7 or 8 bowie-knives. The swag
weighs about two tons, and there are three pack-
horses to carry it; three elephants couldn’t get it
all aboard, much less hump it. They are all
dressed just as they left ’Ome; even the sailor
wore a blue pilot jacket, wide trousers, and
oheesecutter cap ; each one had a revolver strapped
to his waist day and night in the township, and
they keep a sharp look out over the sandhills for
hostile blacks. It is said they had several severe
chills when they first came, caused by the sudden
appearance of the Japs, who run the laundry
here, hanging out clothes. However, confidence
was restored when one Jap. shook out what they
took to be a flag of truce. It was only one of the
local dude’s white shirts at the wash, but they
didn’t know any better. The amusing part of
the matter is, they are going out to Cossack to
select a reef, then to London to float it into
a co. in three months from date. They have not
the slightest doubt about their ability to do it, at
least the Dutch professor—who is the leader—has
not. They don’t want to kill any more blacks
than they can help, so Herr Professor has pro-
vided a large quantity of detonators which will
explode on striking the ground. These they will
throw at the blacks as they approach— to frighten
them. Should the black breddern disregard the
warning, then their blood will be on their own
heads— i.e., if the prospectors can find their guns
in time and shoot straight. The serene asinine
oocksureness of the party, even to the finding of
the reef, and the price they will ask, is simply
marvellous.”

The Eu-Chen Massacre.
The periodical tale of missionary massacres
arrives from China. In that country the
missionary-slaughter season comes much as
the drought year does in Australia ; it has
no fixed date ; there may be a long or short
interval between the times of its recurrence,
and its severity and duration and the area
affected are all uncertain—but sooner or later
its coming may be relied upon. Just now
China is more disorganised than usual, and
a faction known as the “ Vegetarians” has
been raging more bitterly than it generally
does, and the latest missionary slaughter—
so far as the daily-paper accounts are to be
lelied upon —has been even more gruesome
than it is at ordinary times. Many of the
victims are women —some of them Australian
women, for the fanatics of this country have
lately been seized with a craze for the con-
version of the Chinaman ; and, therefore, the
tale of outrage and horror is of much local
interest. So far, it is only the missionary
side of the story that has been heard, and
probably things will remain that way ; the
Chinese story, if there As such a thing, is
never listened to. A discordant howl for
vengeance has gone up in all -directions,
and in reply to the demands made for
blood and retaliation the Mongolian autho-
rities have promised the fullest satisfac-
tion. Satisfaction, in such cases, mostly
consists in the arrest of a number of
the poorest and least influential in-
habitants, whq are tortured, probably along
with their wives and children, until some
acknowledgment of their guilt .'fs'obtained,
and then executed by various shuddery pro-
cesses. The real criminals, as a rule, repre-
sent secret societies which the local man-
darins dare not provoke ; so when the repre-
sentatives of European alleged Christianity
demand justice—well-knowing what manner
of justice is to be expected—and leave the
details of it to the Chinese official intellect,
there is very little to choose between them
and the “Vegetarian” mob. The pious
element of this country is hereby invited to
seriously consider this aspect of the case.
* * *
The periodical missionary slaughter is a
subject which is generally regarded from one
side only. Yet it is a question which has
many sides and many aspects. The mis-
sionary is forced upon the Chinaman by
brute force and insolent aggression. Be-
cause the Mongol is much more ignorant
than the Western, therefore his religion is
much more real —to himself ; education
breeds religious indifference, whereas ignor-
ance and pious fervor go together. To him
therecomes an aggressive, black-coated person
to tell him that he is a fool and a mere heathen
—that his religion is blank superstition —that
his ancestors, whom he regards with a rever-
ence wholly incomprehensible to the Euro-
pean, are probably in a new and awful variety
of hell, and many other things. The .mis-
sionary, because he is backed up by foreign
ambassadors and foreign ironclads and
foreign bayonets, is a symbol of conquest.
If he is insulted or injured his country
demands “ satisfaction,” which means .
butchery and torture, practically on his own
unsupported version of the case ; therefore,
he is not only an insult to the Chinaman's
faith but an insult to his sense of justice and
his national feeling—if he has such things.
The Englishman, or Scotsman, or Irishman,
in the days when he believed sufficiently in
his own creed to take any serious interest in
it, would have probably been almost as mur-
derous, if somewhat less brutal, under simi-
lar provocation. The history of the British
isles is dotted over with stories of religious,
wars and disturbances and persecutions and
tortures, some of which compare not at all
unfavorably with the recent doings in China.
And it is a dead certainty that the English-
man, or Scotsman, or Irishman of to-day
would rise in revolt against foreign mission-
aries who were forced upon him in the same
fashion that he forces himself upon the
Mongolian. This is not intended to excuse
the Chinaman, for that unspeakable heathen,
in some of his aspects, is past all excuse ; it
is only meant to show that there is more
than one side to this case, as there is to
every other.
«
Australia, of recent years, has taken the
Chinese missionary craze badly. Many
enthusiastic young people, mostly female,
have gone to almost certain death in some
shape or other—probably a death of violence,
torture and outrage—in the interior of that
almost unknown land, and have been
whooped on in their fatuous career by stout
and comfortable pastors who have them-
selves carefully remained at home. The
Bulletin's opinion of these pastors would
be best expressed in tar and feathers ; the
conduct of the men who will cheerfully shed
the blood of some foolish and misguided girl
in a cause for which they will not adventure
their own, can be better described in that
way than in any other. And the cause itself
is so pitiably, miserably, unspeakably hope-
less. Europe and America and Australia
are about as little Christian as Asia. The
Gospel has been preached to the white races
for nineteen centuries, and almost the only
result is a contemptuous indifference. There
was some semblance of real belief in the
ignorant Middle Ages, and the Church was
then a great and unsavory reality ; now it is
little more than a shadow. If the white
races to-day believed in their own creed the
whole fabric of their civilisation would drop
to pieces, for it is all built on greed and
commercialism and strife and injustice and
miscellaneous iniquity. And since the Church,
after many centuries of opportunity, has
failed to convert a respectable fraction of its
own professed believers—since it has even
failed to convert itself—it has exceedingly
little hope of making an impression on the
stupendous dead weight of Asiatic heathen-
dom. It knows this fact well—it cannot but
know it—and therefore its action in sending
out helpless girls to be outraged and
slaughtered by the unspeakable leper to no
possible purpose, save that they may serve
as a gaudy advertisement for its own inter-
ests, is all the more reprehensible. The
man whose sister or daughter insists upon
going upon such an errand, if no possible
form of dissuasion will prevail, is morally
justified in shooting her to save her from the
far worse fate which, sooner or later, will
almost certainly befall her.
» * *
The whole scheme of missionary enter-
prise is based on that curious kink in human
nature which makes the most distant field
look the greenest, and the Chinese apostle,
and the Paraguayan emigrant, and the
Soudan Contingent, and the digger who
wanders to drought-stricken Coolgardie, are
all cranks of the same order. Asia and Africa
are dotted oyer with mission stations,
and thousands of pounds are spent annu-
ally in offering to the Moslem and the
Buddhist and the. Brahmin and the Con-
fucian those dogmas in which their own
professors are steadily losing faith—and the
really authentic converts could probably be
countedonthe fingers of one hand. The whole
propaganda is a dismal failure. And mean-
while the ugly, prosaic, dingy, unromantic
heathenism of Little Bourke-street and the
Sydney “ Rocks,”* and countless similar
places, not to speak of the equally hopeless
heathenism of Toorak and Darling Point,
passes unnoticed. In the desire to convert the
man afar off who has a religion already--and
perhaps almost as efficient n one as that
which is offered in its stead—very little
account is taken of the person near at hand
who has no real religion at all. The sensa-
tional adult fanatic who desires to go to a
strange, weird land of images and old tradi-
tions, and preach to a picturesque face with
pig tails, is, after all, only an etherealised
variety of the sensational small boy who
reads penny dreadfuls and wants to go
wildly forth and scalp the alleged Indian in
Arizona. The people who subscribe vast
sums for the conversion of the picturesque
person with the pig tail, and yet leave the
hungry, sordid, dingy ruffianism of their own
cities practically unnoticed, represent the
same order of mind at second-hand. The
English-speaking races send out more mis-
sionaries than all the rest of the world put
together, for the same reason that they
explore more strange countries, and kill
more Indians, and climb more tall moun-
tains, and shoot more bears, and go to more
prize-fights, and are more anxious to find
the North Pole than most other people. In
other words, they do it because they are a
roving, restless, unsatisfied race with the
love of adventure and loot in their souls, and
some of them take the Scripture along with
them by accident.
• *
This same spirit of. missionary enterprise
has been a curse to many lands, but to few,
of late years, more than to China. The
teacher who goes to the back blocks of that
feebly-governed land takes her life —for they
seem to be mostly females nowadays in her
hand, and frequently loses it. Then the
unspeakable mandarin, being ordered to do
justice to the murderers, with whom he is
generally in sympathy, indulges in wholesale
butchery among the more friendless of the
inhabitants, or among his personal enemies,
with all manner of miscellaneous horrors
thrown in. The converts are very scarce,
and the butchery is generally very plentiful.
Therefore, every Australian girl-fanatic who
wants to go on .the Chinese mission, would
do well to remember that she not only risks
her own life but .may i>o indirectly the cause
of torture and’ death .and unimaginable
horrors to dozens of innocent inhabitants
who will have cause to curse her memory,
and that the missionary in China is re-
membered chiefly by the blood of the wrong
person that is shed to avenge her death.
Presumably every individual lias a right to
suicide as he or she may think proper, but
the right to buy a gaudy martyrdom at the
expense of others, even indirectly, is more
than questionable.
# * *
The recent massacre will probably assist
rather than discourage the Chinese mis-
sionary movement. There is an element of
pathetic romance in the story which appeals
strongly to a certain class of mind. Pew
people could read without genuine sympathy
the tale told in the Australian daily press of
the two sisters from Melbourne who were
killed in that upheaval, and of their mother
who looked with tearless eyes through her
spectacles and refused to grieve over their
“glorious death” as martyrs —adding that
if she had more daughters she would gladly
give them to the Cause. And, meanwhile,
as likely as not, some yellow mother on the
river Min looks out as steadily through her
horn spectacles and refuses to weep for her
sous who were executed .for their share, or
alleged share, in the massacre, because they
also died in the good cause of religion. The
good cause of religion covers a multitude of
sins ; and the relatives of those who died in
trying to spread one set of incomprehensible
dogmas, and the relatives of those who were
executed for defending, in a crude and
primitive fashion, another set equally in-
comprehensible, probably feel the same up-
lifting of soul. Also, each crowd regards
the other as benighted heathens with the
same pitying self-complacency, and the
same stolid confidence, born of their
own ignorance, in the ignorance of the
other lot. All religions rest, more or
less, upon ignorance ; by the time one
gets to know anything worth speaking
of he has begun to realise how little he
really does know, and then he hasn’t
sufficient faith left in his own dogmas
to obtrude them upon anybody. There-
fore, there is about as much chance of the
Confucian converting the Christian in the
end as of being converted himself ; the
former, being the more ignorant of the two,
is at least a great deal more certain of his
Confucianism than the latter is of his Chris-
tianity. And there is very little chance of
any nation being converted from one creed
to another by modern methods ; most, if not
all, of the nations which have been con-
verted owe their conversion either partially
or entirely to brute force, and if there is
even one reliable instance to the con-
trary The Bulletin fails at the present
moment to recollect it. Therefore, the
Chinese side of the case —for even so bad
a case as this has a Chinese side which
deserves a fair hearing —may be summed up
in three sentences : (1) The sending of mis-
sionaries to the “ heathen ” is a supercilious
insult, inasmuch as no one really knows for
certain which creed is more heathen than
the other ; (2) the sending of missionaries
to teach a creed which its own professors
obviously don’t believe is an anomaly ; and
(3) the Chinaman is more or less human,
like the balance of humanity, and when a
superior foreign person, who tells him that
his dogmas are mere folly and superstition, is
thrust on him by military force he resents it
‘ —just as the Englishman would under the
same conditions. But, being a barbarous,
medi.eval sort of person, he resents it more
brutally than the Englishman would do.
The British Elections.
Here is a ten-years’ table of British elections :
Lib. L.U. Conserv. Imlep. Parn. Nat-
-1885 331 249 4 86
1886 192 77 316 85
1892 x 275 46 268 9 72
1895 176 ' 72 340 12 70
So that the purely Liberal minority in the
present Parliament is the smallest for the
decade ; the purely Conservative majority
is the largest for the" decade. there is
a nearly two-thirds majority against Irish
Home Rule. The Irish party, as a whole, has
gained one seat, but it lias failed to recover
other four seats wrenched from it since ’B5.
The Parnellite section has won ground ; the
Nationalist section has lost it. Anil the purely
Conservative party is far the strongest in the
new House —has indeed a majority over all
other parties combined. \ Just before the
election, the utmost majority the Unionist
leaders hoped for was 65 —some put it as low
as 31 ; the electors gave them 154.

Mathematicians claim that, given a complete
knowledge of the state of a particle ol matter-
at any instant of lime, you would know its
history from and to all eternity. Doubtless it
is the same in politics : a complete knowledge
of conditions would mean a complete know-
ledge of causes and effects, and make prophecy
inevitable and superfluous. Though the Liberals
may not be able to understand the necessity of
their defeat, it seems natural enough to both
sides. Three months ago “one of the ablest
Radicals (Laboucheke) acknowledged that
the Conservatives were likely to be in power
for fifteen years out of the next twenty. The
Unionists, he said, will probably be in power
from 1896 to 1902. And even if a Separatist
party is then returned, it will scarcely be able
to keep office more than two or three years
against the Opposition in the Commons and in
the Upper House ” (Saturday Review, May 4).
# # •
The fact is that when Gladstone espoused
Irish Home Rule lie laid his axe to the root of
Liberal-party prosperity. Not through the
rupture alone, though that was sufficiently
serious ; but because he saddled his followers
with what is, for the present, essentially a
losing cause. Nearly every impartial observer
admits the justice of Home Rule for Ireland ;
but a great many impartial observers doubt its
expediency for Britain —if conceded on anything
like the lines which the Irish desire. A
majority of English electors certainly share this
doubt. In spite of the advances of Liberalism
in the towns, the bulk of English sentiment
remains persistently Tory. To the instinc-
tive dislike of change is added a racial antipathy
to the Irish. Seventy-five years ago Sydney
Smith published a cultivated Englishman’s
opinion of the Irish. He said :
The Irishman has many good qualities : he is brave,
vsltty, generous, eloquent, hospitable, and open-hearted ;
but he is vain, ostentatious, extravagant, and fond of dis-
play-light in council—deficient in perseverance—without
skill in public or private economy —an enjoyer, not an
acquirer—one who despises the slow and patient virtues
who wants the superstructure without the foundation—the
result without the operation—the oak without the acorn
and the three hundred years of economy.
The lapse of time would not prevent many
cultured Englishmen of to-day from cordially-
assenting to this judgment; and the uncul-
tured distrust the Irishman for his bad
qualities, distrust him almost as much for the
good ones which they are characteristically in-
capable of comprehending.
» # •
Every year since ’B6 has made it clearer
that Gladstone shouted for Home Rule before
English electors were ready—and English
electors send to the House of Commons more
than two-thirds of its members. At the outset
it was confidently prophesied that the Unionist
Liberals must soon return to the Grand Old
Shepherd’s fold ; that their coalition with the
Tories could not last; that Home Rule was a
certainty in a year, in three years, in five.
Yet even while Gladstone’s influence remained,
it was clear that he had either very much
over-rated that influence, or very much under-
rated the obstacles opposed to it. Now that
Gladstone is gone—with all his faults, the
Achilles of the Liberal camp—the achieve-
ment of Home Rule seems indefinitely postponed.
The mere passage of a Home Rule Bill through
the Commons by a small majority, as in ’93,
will never be accepted by the Lords and the
Crown as sufficient reason for a constitutional
change so momentous. And the Crown and the
Lords must be reckoned/ with ; they are part of
the system of “things as they are;” and
though reason and enthusiasm may destroy
them every day in speech and argument,
they still exist. There is little effective
republican sentiment in England ; the cru-
sade against the Lords has fallen miser-
ably flat. Rosebery may not have been
diplomatic, but he was certainly correct
when he endorsed Salisbury’s statement that
“ before Irish Home Rule is conceded
by the Imperial Parliament, England, as the
predominant member of the partnership of the
three kingdoms, will have to be convinced of
its justice.” And the conversion of England
proceeds more slowly than in the days of
Colitmba. Possibly the issue may be what
seems to many Australians the most sensible
course : the concession of Home Rule to Eng-
land, Scotland, Ireland and Wales alike, and
the release of the “ weary Titan ” among Par-
liaments from the burden of all but matters of
Imperial concern.

The position of the Unionist Liberals in the
new House is interesting. The English genius
still runs to Government by Contradiction—as
is partly shown by the snuffing out of the
independent Labor-party at last election, and
the failure of the highly-moral “New Party”
to make any impression on the serried Liberal
and Tory ranks. Hence.the Gladstonian con-
clusion that it was only a question of time till
the dissentients should find a third-party career
impossible. But it was forgotten that there
was a choice. Instead of advancing with
Gladstone, the Unionist Liberals have re-
treated with Salisbury ; or, rather, they have
marked time until Salisbury came up. The
drift to the Tories has ended in fusion, and
quite probably the Balfour - Chamberlain
alliance will result in the permanent loss of the


Liberal- Unionists to the Liberal camp, and
their permanent gain by the Tories. After all,
new Liberal is but old Conservative writ broad ;
the Tories to-day (thanks partly to Randolph
Churchill) are further advanced on many
points than the Liberals of half-a-century ago;
and the Chamberlain strain will still further
improve the blood. So that the new coalition
Ministry is likely to be quite as democratic as
British electors wish.

The Parnellite gain of three seats, as con-
trasted with the Nationalist loss of two, has
significance, and it is a gain which may be ex-
pected to increase. The Irish are characteristic
extremists, and the results of the M'Cauthy
policy arrive too slowly to satisfy them long.
Ireland has not yet recovered from the loss of
Parnell. Apart from the weakness of the
“split,” there is the weakness from the trans-
ferred leadership. Justin M'Cakthy, with all
his capacity, is too much the amiable old gentle-
man to stand at the Irish party’s helm in stormy
political seas. Undoubtedly his policy of
moderation is the best policy possible. The
antics of a dynamite faction stir, not fear, but
resentment in English minds. On the other
hand, English minds are sluggish, and apt to
forget Irish wrongs altogether unless persis-
tently pricked to notice them. Perhaps
M‘Carthy has been too lax : already there are
symptoms of revolt from his mild rule. And if
Irish Home Rule is to be indefinitely deferred,
it is unlikely that the Irish calm will continue.
Genius and Gingerbread.
“ Letters, ” wrote Hobbes, “are the Message
-of the Ages, and I hold him no true bearer
thereof who knoweth not that in such sort
there can come to him no honor from the hand
of lesser man—-even though that man weareth
crown and calleth himself king!” “Litera-
ture,” says Hume, “ is the loftiest of all pur-
suits, and confers, in itself, a real rank upon its
followers which cannot be other than soiled and
diminished by the futile distinctions of an
adventitious one.” The straight, strong voices,
these, of men, who honored and were honored
by that Ars Maxima so pitifully bedraggled
nowadays by such small, apologetic snivellings
as marked the recent congratulatory Besant
function. The “Sir” conferred upon that
assiduous book-builder was intended, it was
alleged, to proclaim to a respectful universe
that “a man of literary genius might properly
be a man of rank.” “ Rank, sir ?” said Vol-
taire to Congreve, when that superlative
person affected to take the great Frenchman’s
visit as paid, not to the author, but to the fine
gentleman. “Have you tlje temerity to suppose
that, but for the man of letters, Voltaire
would have wasted a thought upon the mere
man of rank ? ”
* 1 # #
That was the case in a nutshell, and no self-
respecting scribbler, with this trumpet-note in
his ears, can fail to blush for the broken-backed
amenities of the Besant, banquet. Whether
Hall Caine meant that the title could now
“properly ” come down to the man, or the man
to the title, is neither clear nor of much conse-
quence, for, in the opinion of everybody who
doesn’t crawl upon literary all-fours, he is
wrong both ways. The title cannot condescend
to the man, any more than the man should
condescend to the title. And such a title !
The literary taker of a tin-pot “ knighthood ”
has not even the miserable satisfaction of find-
ing himself upon the social level of the multi-
tude of men whose genealogy has been for-
gotten in their genius. Smollett, Fielding,
ByroN and Shelley claimed aristocratic lineage,
yet recognised, nevertheless, their truest distinc-
tion in a pursuit the dignity of which is now
grotesquely supposed to be enhanceable by the
same titular label that is bestowed, as a
matter of form, upon the successful huckster,
who chances to be Mayor of Lickspittleton
when Victoria by the Grace happens along that
way.

It was a remark of Addison’s that things are
often considered inherently ridiculous merely
because they have been cleverly laughed at;
which is not more true than that, conversely,
the most intrinsically pitiful absurdity may be
gravely accepted because it has not hitherto
been laughed at at all. And, so hard is it to
make the middle-class Briton conceive of any
sort of title, in any sort of circumstances, as
other than a lovely and delightful thing, that—
even when, with Besant and Caine, and a host
of others, he takes successfully to literature—
he never realises that, as a partaker with the
Immortals in the dignity of letters, he cannot
hut be humiliated with a title aristocratically
endurable only when it is proudly borne aloft'
by a member of the profession which gallantly
cuts throats for glory—and wages !

Right away at the tail-end of that melancholy
catalogue, the Order of Precedence, “ literary
persons and others ” are faintly discernible-
lumped thus ignominiously together as being
quite too absurdly remote from the haughty
cognisance of the Boss-Jeames to be worth any
further discrimination. But the “ literary
person,” when he isn’t also a self-seeking snob,
will be the last to quarrel with the inference
that in this gilded register of flunkeydom he
has properly no place at all, and that—were
the procession, with a right-about-face, to
march from the throne, as Men, instead of
towards it, as lackeys—the Last would be First
and the First Last !
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Judge Windeyer's “Hard Luck.”
■'N'.S.W. Judge Windkyjsk lias “bard luck.”
On top of a judicial record stained with such
an outrage on justice as the Mount Rennie case,
with such an averted outrage on justice as the
Dean case, are now piled his Honor’s misfor-
tunes in connection with the Butler divorce-
case and the Sanomann perjury case. The
first lias to do with Thomas Butler, a Sydney
chemist .who wanted to get rid of his w.fe. He
hired Charles Davis, a private detective, and
Susannah Peake, a concocter of pills, to fur-
nish evidence to incriminate her. Failing to
get it by fair means, it was obtained by foul.
Davis got admittance to Butler’s house while
Mrs. Butler was alone there ; Butler burst
in, according to a pre arranged plot, and found
Davis under the table. Judge Windeyer heard
the case; summed up against Mrs. Butler;
she was found guilty of adultery ; and the
divorce was granted. In giving his decree,
the Judge said tiie adultery was clearly proved ;
Mrs. Butler’s story (that Davis and her hus-
band were in collusion) was full of discrepancies
and he entirely disbelieved it ; while he be-
lieved the petitioner, dismissed a counter-
charge of adultery against him, and.gave him the
custody of his children. Further, one Johnson,
Mrs. Butler’s brother, had given evidence
tending to exonerate her. Judge Windeyer
said he believed Johnson wasa perjurer; gaveas
partly justifying the belief the grotesque reason
that Johnson shuffled his feet in the witness-
box ; and committed him for trial accordingly.
In due course Johnson, who shuffled his feet,
was hauled up before another Judge, and got
three years’hard labor for perjury. There, so
far as Judge Windeyer was concerned, the
matter rested. Luckily, Mrs. Butler didn’t
rest. Broken in health, mourning for her dead
father, craving for her children, without money,
almost friendless, she struggled on until she
accumulated evidence on which Butler, Davis,
and Peake Were last week brought to trial for
conspiracy, found guilty on clear evidence, and
sentenced, Davis and Butler to seven years’,
and Peake to four years’ penal servitude;
while the jury also found that Mrs. Butler
was not' guilty of adultery. In fairness to
Judge Windeyer, it should be borne in mind
that lie had before him only part of the evidence
adduced at the last trial, and did not know
the vital fact that Davis, the detective,
and Williams, the missing co-respondent, were
the same person. It was just his “ hard luck ! ”
In the second case, an obscure person named
August >Sandmann, on June 11, swore before
Judge Windeyer that his landlord smashed
open his door with a hammer and chisel. Mrs.
Sandmann corroborated. Judge Windeyer
didn’t believe them; and they were both thrown
into gaol on a charge of perjury. Sandmann
was brought out for trial on July 29, and a jury
acquitted him at once—just like Judge Win-
de yen’s “hard luck!” Mrs. Sandmann
remains in gaol with an eight-months-old baby ;
her husband is too poor to bail her out ; and he
says he can’t ascertain when her trial is to take
place. Johnson, who shuffled his feet, is also
in gaol at. time of writing. Possibly he and
Mrs. Sandmann will, in the.course of the year,
be. let out to rejoin Sandmann and Mrs. Butler.
Then they may gather up the tangled skeins of
their .lives; and thank Fate that at least theya
have not, like other victims, been crushed out
of existence altogether ; and bemoan Judge
Windeyer’s “hard luck.”
Tote Charity.
Editor Bulletin,— Bluff parson Edgar (Melb.)
wanted to know, the other day, why all the
tote profits are not to be given to charities.
The question probes a fundamental principle.
Edgar’s 17 stone of admirable misdirected
enthusiasm is aghast at the penury of dole and
donation societies. This poor-sinner protests
against the whole mob that is palliating and
soothing the sense of wrong in suffering man.
The charity clause in the tote proposal is catch-
penny at the best—in its essence it is one with
all the schemes that keep breath in the bodies of
laborersuntilFat Man wants to hire their brawn.
Charity is rose-water, and we want disinfectant.
The rule of the old French courts was perfume
and no bath—civet disguised the dirty-human
exhalation, and the timps were satisfied. In
our times charity hushes up a multitude of
sins. Charity says with Compromise, in the
words of a Bulletin bard :—•
The limpid clarity of truth
I phosphoresce with lies.
Charity is among the many vicious propensities
that make Fat Men dangerous. Some brewer
who has committed adulteration all his life
gives .£lOOO to the benevolent-.asylum—what
does it do but spin out the miserable existence
left to the survivors of his adulterant practices ?
In the case of tote-charity—what wilt the pro-
ceeds do, as far as they go, but help to stave
off the day of reckoning with the laud-mono-
polist, the machinery-monopolist, and all the
hell-brood ? Be just, and you will not need to
be generous. In my opinion, gambling is a
luxury as indispensable to the present genera-
tion of men as linen collars. The man who
goes to excess in linen collars is an evil, but no
one proposes to put a tax of per cent, on
linen collars to keep down dudes. Let the
• tote be fought for on its merits—don’t let- it
rank with the wicked dramateur performances
that defame art in the name of charity. Men
ask for justice, and they get—charity.
The tired world sits hungry and cold
’Neath Charity's cuis ,
A thief that lias stolen ns gold
Returning the purse.
The other Bulletin bard who said this prac-
tically wrote finis to the discussion. So 1
answer the excellent Edgar by saying that
tote-charity is a mistake. Gambling is an
element of man’s enjoyment, and he should get
it unadulterated. I l ’.

A large number of remarkable items appear
among theN.S.W. Government’s loan expendi-
ture for the first half of 1895. Some of the
most striking are £74 for cranes, moorings, etc.,
at Byron Bay; £Bl9 for additions to Newington
/Asylum ; £3718 for alterations to Circular
Quay, Sydney ; £972 for wood-paving on certain
city streets; £(i lbs. lid. for removing an
obstruction in Clarence River ; buying sites for
Land Board offices, £770 ; lighthouse, £157 ;
alterations lo sundry gaols, £6019; bridge at
Bullock Island, £1075 ; dredging Richmond
River, £15,931; ditto Clarence River, £10,636 ;
ditto Cook’s River, £437 ; and draining Rook-
wood cemetery, £3182. Then come—surveying
and taking soundings of sundry rivers, £6212 ;
more alterations .at Circular Quay, £1513;
taking snags out of creeks tunning into Rich-
mond River, £562 ; removing obstructions from
Clarence River, £lO9l ; ditto Tweed River,
£241 ; more alterations to Circular Quay,
£l4ll ; more dredging of Tweed River,
£8574; altering and patching old dredge,
£1591; and thinning-out forests, £13,488. The
total expenditure of borrowed money for
the six months, apart from mere book
entries re the conversion of old loans, is
£1,024,000. And of this amount about
£OOO,OOO is for works which produce no reve-
nue, and which there is no possible excuse
for charging to posterity, seeing that the nation
will need to keep on building new bridges, or
re-building old ones, and dredging rivers, and
repairing old dredges, and thinning out State
forests, and making drains, and repairing or
altering, or rebuilding public offices as long as
the present variety of civilisation lasts. As
posterity will have to pay its own annual bill
for these works for ever and ever, it is the
meanest kind of dishonesty to charge it with
the bill of the present generation also. Previous
New South Wales Treasurers, who were mostly
a politically dishonest and unscrupulous crowd,
spent, on an average, £400,000 a year of loan
money on works which yielded no revenue
and which should have been charged to current
revenue, but G. H. Reid, the most utterly
unscrupulous of the crowd, “ blews ” the
borrowed funds for revenue purposes at
the rate of fully a million per annum,
and may fairly be described as times
worse than his predecessors. The country, as
a rule, only demands that the Treasurer should
have an alleged surplus at the end of the year ;
if one Treasurer meets the public liabilities
honestly and comes out with £300,000 shortage
his reputation promptly drops to zero, while
another, who pays £1,000,000 of his ordinary
ex.’s out of loans and then has £lOO,OOO of
bogus surplus, can live for years afterwards on
the financial reputation thus acquired. Premier
Reid, however, charges over £1,000,000 a year
of his current expenses to posterity, and has a
huge deficiency besides, and the fact that he
has contrived to make some kind of a financial
reputation out of these two circumstances,
either one of which would have wrecked any
other man, is a marvellous proof of the power
of bunkum and moral grease.
A Fire-Insurance Item.
For 34 years past there has been in force in
Queensland a wise law whereby no bequest
to any church is valid unless the will by
which it is effected is made in the presence
of three witnesses, and is executed and regis-
tered at least a month before testator’s decease.
The reason of this is that almost every man is
more or less weak-minded in his last moments,
and when a ghostly comforter with an itching
palm whispers horrible things about hell in his
ear he is sometimes willing to disinherit all his
relatives and make over his property in the
most reckless fashion by way of effecting a fire
insurance on his soul. The said law is not an
absoluteguaranteeagainst undue influence on the
part of the ghostly comforter, but it does a good
deal in that direction. Now, however, Attor-
ney-General Byrnes has a bill before Queens-
land Assembly for the repeal of this wise
enactment, so that the ghostly comforter may
have better opportunities than hitherto to grab
the inheritance of the deceased as he drifts into
the shuddery hereafter. Up to date, though
several Labor and Opposition members warmly
opposed the bill, and thereby made Attorney-
General Byrnes very angry, the public has not
manifested any serious interest in it; even the
local Worker passes it by with the casual
remark that it contains nothing of public in-
terest. The Bulletin has grave doubts whether
any bequest to any church should be valid, even
if it were made 40 years before the death of the
testator and signed in the presence of 3000
witnesses, let alone three. Death-bed libe-
rality is not a thing to be encouraged. If a
man doesn’t care sufficiently for the Church to
give his money to it while he is alive and well,
and thereby deny himself for its benefit, there
seems no sufficient reason why he should be
allowed to deny his |g,mily—-supposing he has
one—-for its benefit when he can’t hang on to
the money himself any longer. This paper has
a profound respect for the person who sacri-
fices his own comfort for a good cause, or even
a bad one which he believes to be good ; but the
person who enjoys his wealth to the last day of
his life, and then tries to be a public benefactor
at the expense of his family only, succeeds in
being a first-class hog.
Spasmodic Charity.
Several Victorian bodies have been moved by
the Eldorado disaster to suggest the establish-
ment of a permanent fund for the relief of
sufferers by fatal mine accidents. Something
of this kind is badly needed, and not in Victoria
alone. New South Wales is even worse off;
for there is some sort of fund in Victoria, and
there is none at all in the older province. At
present the widow and family of the miner who
is killed by himself in a commonplace way
stand very little chance of getting a sixpence
from mineowners or public. He may leave eight
or nine children in peculiarly bad circumstances;
but the public knows nothing of that —it
reads only the two-line notice that “John
Smith was yesterday killed by a fall of stone
in the Big Blow mine,” and thinks no more of
the insignificant item. But when half-a-dozen
men are killed in a sensational manner, the
public does not stop to inquire into the circum-
stances of the families, but hysterically rushes
off either to get itself on the committee or to
plank down its money. Nine men were killed
at Broken Hill the other day. They were
nearly all young men, several of them un-
married, and they left “only 25 children among
them ” ; and several of these were, compara-
tively speaking, well provided for. In a
few days, however, £l5OO had been col-
lected the mine-directors paid £5OO, the
Melbourne Stock Exchange, £lOO. At the
same time a woman with seven or eight young
children was living in destitution, her husband
having just before been killed at another of the
mines and only with the greatest difficulty
could a few pounds be scraped together Locally
for her and her children’s relief. During last
year nine.men were killed in. the Broken Hill
mines; but, except in one case, they had the
misfortune to be killed “by ones.” What became
of their families nobody seems to know, and
nobody seems to care. It is not complained
that the relatives of the sixes and the nines
who are killed get too much ; but it is com-
plained that the relatives of the ones, who
suffer just as keenly, should not get anything.
And it seems that nothing short of a permanent
fund, administered by reason and not controlled
by hysterics, will remove the cause of the com-
plain t.
Another Pipe Contract.
Premier Reid, the head and boss of the
N.S.W. Freetraders, has fallen away into Pro-
tection. Every Freetrader wants Protection
for his own industry, if he has one, and every
Freetrader has to go back, from utter shame,
on his own soulless, bowelless faith sooner or
later. A large number of the pipe-moulders of
Sydney are out of work just now, and, to
relieve them, Premier Reid has given a large
contract for pipes to two local firms. This is
certainly not consonant with any Freetrade
doctrine which he has ever preached. When
the deputation of workless pipe-moulders waited
upon him he should simply have said something
like this : “My friends, I am sorry for you,
but the doctrine of Freetrade says that we
must buy in the cheapest market, regardless of
the personal sufferings of individuals. Free-
trade is absolutely correct at all times,
and, even if you, and your wives, and your
infants, starve under its operations, yet it
remains correct all the same.” Then he should
have called for tenders, and if an English
or Belgian firm offered to do the work at a
fraction under the local price, lie should have
given them the business and let the local
workers and their families starve if need be.
Instead of which he did not even call for
tenders locally, but gave the order privately in
order to supply employment, regardless of pos-
sible cost, on the theory that it is better to
find work for the people of the country than to
get things a shade cheaper from a foreign
market. This is the doctrine of Protection
exactly. But why should the city workers,
who mostly voted for Freetrade, not get it,
while the country ones, who mostly voted
against it, are to have it in all its beauty ?
Premier Reid’s ten appointments to the N.S.
Wales Legislative Council are another proof
that the good politician and the bad politician
are very much alike when they get into office.
When he was an irresponsible fat man in Oppo-
sition, G. H. Reid complained bitterly, from a
lofty moral standpoint, of the iniquity of shov-
ing rejected and cast-off politicians into .the
Council, and thereby making a life-long legis-
lator out of a person whom the country didn’t
regard as. good enough to be trusted with the
same office for three years. Yet, of his own
nominees, Daniel O’Connor has been rejected
at three successive elections ; S. E. Lees has
just been been badly beaten at the Nepean
by a constituency which had tried him and
found him a woeful failure; Pulsford is a
defeated candidate who never even got into
the Assembly ; and Blanksby, the Newcastle
ex-preacher and building society manager, has
been rejected at two successive elections. In
all, seven out of the ten are politicians whom the
people have decisively voted down at the polls.
All ten are solid Foreign-traders, despite the fact
that Premier Reid was wont to complain
bitterly of the policy of making appointments
on purely party lines; and only two are sus-
pected of any serious democratic leanings.
Altogether, the only serious objection to G. H.
Reid’s nominees is that they are almost every-
thing which G. H. Reid has proved that they
should not be.
The Rev. Edgar, Wesleyan pulpiteer of Mel-
bourne, predicts the demoralisation of owners
if the “ tote” is permitted. It seems, accord-
ing to the parson’s view, that the good, kind
men who own racers will strive to deceive
people as to the condition of their nags in order
to work the machine for all it is worth. Then,
to show that he knows what he is talking about,
the reverend wedges slabs like this into his
sermon. Verbatim quote
Repents will be circulated that “ Daimio did a three-
mile ao the other morning, and, after clearing six fences
‘ like a bird,’ without putting a toe on one, skipped over
the last six furlongs in 1.4, and pulled up without turning
a hair.” Or that— “My horse, poor devil, I don’t know
what’s up with him. He couldn’t raise a gallop fit to
keep himself warm. I gave him a ‘go,’ and, after baulk-
ing once, he got over three fences, clouting every one of
them, barking his front legs, and, I think, hurt his stifle.
I am just starting him on the off chance.”
We are always wishing parsons would be men
of the world, and yet when they try to be they
invariably make pathetic exhibitions of them-
selves. The spectacle of a seven-foot adult like
Edgar anathematising the machine as calculated
to introduce an element of fiction into the tips
and racing rumors, as if they weren’t already, as
full of it as they can be, is calculated to give
the man in the street cramp in the stomach.
The bi-metallic problem is not growing -any
more lucid as time goes on. The perpetual
depreciation of the silver coinage of India,
China, Japan and other countries is admittedly
producing strange convulsions in the commercial
world. The Indian rupee, for example, con-
tains practically the same amount of silver as
the British and Australian florin, yet while it is
worth almost as much as it ever was to buy goods
in India it is worth only a little over Is. for ex-
changing into gold. Therefore, the Hindoo who
sends wheat to England can exchange every
sovereign he receives in payment into 20 florins
while the Australian exporter can only get ten
florins for his sovereign. Consequently, the
Hindoo gets twice as much for his produce as
he used to do. And, on the other hand, he has
to pay nearly 20 rupees instead of 10 for ill
worth of English goods, therefore ho-is protected
to the extent of 100 per cent, all round, conse-
quently in India and Japan manufactures are in-
creasing much faster than in England—in some
lines 10 or 12 times faster, according to
latest advices. This looks like a solid argu-
ment in favor of bi-metallism, only several
other considerations block the w;ay tl 'lndia
and Japan are doing well at present in
certain, directions because they have a depre-
ciated silver currency. Argentina is also

exactly the same results. Apparently, there-
fore, under certain circumstances which are not
very well defined, a depreciated silver or paper
currency may be a blessing to the community,
for a time, at all events. The latter has the
advantage of being much easier to obtain ; all
that is required is to issue irredeemable Govern-
ment notes in sufficient quantities and the
thing is done. The paper is also much easier
to keep in the proper stale of depreciation, and
it costs much less to produce in the first place.
Also, if it shows any signs of leaving off being
depreciated it can always be shoved down-
again by a new issue. Bi-metallism consists
practically in enacting that so much silver is
worth so much gold ; the other thing consists
in enacting that so much paper is worth so
much gold. And both of them—but The Bul-
letin here leaves off to take a well-earned rest.
Nothing else in this world is quite so wearing
as the bi-metallic problem,
Walter Besant, the English novelist, says
in one of his books that England will one
day slick up a huge placard on her side of the
Straits of Dover, with the inscription for all the
world to read, “Suicided for the sake of Free-
trade.” Joseph Hatton, another English nove-
list and journalist, made a few remarks recently
on the same subject
It was so cold on that mountain that you couldn’t
sp ak the truth. Mark Twain had been there, and he
knew. It is tile same with the Fieetrade mountain. No-
body is ever certain of himself there. He certainly never
speaks the truth about it. Political controversy is, how-
ever, proteeted by a generally acknowledged licence to
exaggerate, if not to lie outright. The late John Bright
couldn't lie any more than Washington, but, like bis
great prototype, lie could strong language. If you
talked Protection or even reciprocity to him he called yon
a fool, an idiot, a pudding-head, and metaphorically landed
you one in the eye. Cobden'S breach of Freel rade principles
in his negotiation of the French treaty did not influence
him in the least. Bright squared his broad shoulders as
before, and swore—in his heart, if not in words—at every-
body who did not bow down to the fetish which he and
Cobdkx had set us. It often happens that men who can
manage everybody else s affairs cannot manage their
own. Coburn couldn’t manage his. Admirers had to
come to his rescue with subscriptions. Bright knew
better. His Freelrade was not all absorbing. It didn’t
allow of any interference with freedom of contract
between him and his work-people. He would have no
Government controlling their hours or wages. The wicked
Tories, however, like the Dock in Dover’s play, “had
sumthin’ to say to that,” and the English laborer got a taste
of freedom at Rochdale as well as llre foreigner. Nobody
asks for Protection to-day. A good many, however, sigh
for a little reciprocity. Freetraders no longer call these
people fools, but they tell them flnnncial romances. Even
Mr. Brvce, M.P., among his West Aberdeen constituents,
talked as if “ other count ties ” had gone hack to Protec-
tion. Few of his hearers probably knew any better.
“The countries which are now under Protection are suf.
fering as much as us,” he said. What other countries?
No other nation has ever adopted Freetrade or dreamt of
it. Every foreign nation since the days of Cobdf.x lias
increased its tariffs, to thedeslrn -lion cf more than one
ort wo great Engli-h industries. Then,of course, Mr. IIRYCK
talked of what we had done with the aid of Freelrade.
He might have sp'ken of what we had done in spite of
it. With a moderate import duly ou foreign goods,
not a protective duty, a duty for revenue, our agriculture
would not have been a ruined industry, our workhouses

The arrogance of Freetraders is colossal ; they claim
everything, allow nothing for natural progress,’for the

Peter Anderson and Co.
A SKETCH OF CITY LIFE.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
He had “ offices ” in Sydney, not so many years
ago,
And his shingle bore tho legend, “ Peter Ander-
son and Co. ;
But his real name was Careless, as the fellows
understood—
And his relatives considered that he wasn’t any
good.
Their gentle tongues had damned whatever “ char-
acter ” he had—
He was fond of beer and leisure—and tho “Co.”
was just as bad.
It was limited, in number, to a unit, was the Co.,
’Twas a bosom chum of Peter’s, and his Christian
name was Joe.
Tis a class of men belonging to these soul-for-
saken years:
Third-rate canvassers, collectors, journalists—and
auctioneers.
They are never very shabby, they are never very
spruce—
Goin" cheerfully and carelessly and smoothly to
the deuce.
Some are wanderers by profession, “ turning up ”
and gone as soon,
Trav’ling second-class, or steerage (when it’s cheap
they go saloon);
Free from “ists” and “ isms,” troubled little by
belief or doubt—
Lazy, purposeless, and useless—knocking round
and hanging out,
They take what they can get, and they give what
they can give,
God alone knows how they manage —God alone
knows how they live !
They are nearly always hard-up, but are cheerful
all the while—
Men whose energy and trousers wear out sooner
than their smile !
They, no doubt, like us, are haunted by the bore-
some “ if ” or “might,”
But their ghosts are ghosts of daylight—they are
men who live at night!
Peter met you with the comic smile of one who
knows you well,
And is mighty glad to see you and has got a joke
to tell.
He could laugh when all was black, and he could
grin when all was blue,
Sing a comic song and act it, and appreciate it,
too.
Seldom serious—doing business just as ’twere a
friendly game
Of billiards —nothing graver. And the Co. was
much the same.
They tried everything and nothing ’twixt the
shovel and the press,
And were more or less successful in their ventures
—mostly less.
(Once they ran a country paper while the editor
was ill,
And the local sinners chuckle over dingy copies
still—
Which are not upon the file—“ standing ” cause of
pain’d regret
To the editor. He hasn’t done apologising yet.
Yet, the editor would often, with an odd, pathetic
smile,
Bead a copy of the issue which is not upon the file,
And he’d think of his chum Peter, and perhaps of
his chum Joe,
And, maybe, he’d write a letter, care of Anderson
and Co.)
They'd been through it all and knew it in the land
of Bills and Jims—
Using Peter’s own expression, they had been in
“ various swims.”
Now and then they’d take an office, as they called
it —make a dash
Into business life as “agents”—something not
requiring cash.
(You can always furnish cheaply, when your cash
or credit fails,
With a packing-case, a hammer, and a pound of
two-inch nails—
And, maybe, a drop of varnish and sienna, too,
for tints,
And a scrap or two of oilcloth, and a yard or two
of chintz.)
They would “pull themselves together,” pay a
week’s rent in advance,
But it never lasted longer than a month by any
chance.
The “ office ” was their haven, for they lived there
when hard-up—
A “ daily” for <* table-cloth—a jam-tin for a cup;
And if the landlord’s bailiff happened round in
times like these
And seized the office-fittings—well, there wasn’t
much to seize,
They would leave him in possession. But, at last,
it came to pass
That a landlord seized the shingle, and he sold it
for old brass !
And it troubled Peter greatly—’twas a name, you
understand,
That he couldn’t purchase cheaply on a brass-plate
second-hand.
“ Might ’a’ left our name,” said Peter, with a
doleful smile at Joe.
“ Dash it all! I wish to gracious that our name
was ‘Smith V Co.’
What did Shakespeare say about it when they
treated him the same ?
‘ He that stole his purse was better than the skunk
that stole his name.’”
But a happy notion struck him and he got a plate
to match—
Sort of movable arrangement that was fasten’d
with a catch,
And when bad-luck brought the bailiff there’d be
nothing to lie seen
Save a piece of bevelled cedar where tho tenant’s
plate had been,
There would be no sign of Peter—there would be
no sipi of Joe
Till another portal boasted “ Peter Anderson and
Co.”
They hung out as long as possible, and after that
they shot
The moon, and took an office where the landlords
knew them not.
And when times were locomotive ! billiard-rooms
and private bars —
Spicy parties at the cafe—long cab-drives beneath
the stars;
Private picnics down the Harbor—shady camp-
ings-out, you know —
No one would have dreamed ’twas Peter—no one
would have thought ’twas Joe !
Free-and-easies in their “diggings,” when the
funds began to fail,
Bosom churns, cigars, tobacco, and a case of
English ale—
Gloriously drunk and happy, till they heard the
roosters crow—
And the landlady and neighbours made com-
plaints about the co. ;
But that life, it might be liken’d to a reckless
drinking-song,
For it can’t go on for ever, and it never lasted
long.
Debt-collecting ruined Peter—people talked him
round too oft,
For his heart was soft as butter (and the Co.’s was
just as soft).
He would cheer the haggard “missus,”and he’d
tell her not to fret,
And he’d ask the worried debtor round with him
to have a wet;
He would ask him round the corner, and it seemed
to him and her.
After each of Peter’s visits, things were brighter
than they were.
But, of course, it wasn’t business—only Peter’s
careless way;
And perhaps it pays in heaven, but on earth it
doesn’t pay.
They got harder up than ever, and, to make it
worse, the Co.
Went more often round the corner than was good
for him to go.
It seems the girl that he loved with the one pure
love of life,
Who, perhaps, loved him—and pitied—had more
sense than be the wife
Of a vagabond and drunkard —well, the world is
free to think
That his., death was caused, or hastened, by
debauchery and drink.
“ I might live,” he said to Peter, “but I haven’t
got the nerve—
“l am going, Peter, going—going, going (no
reserve).
“‘Eat and drink and love’ they tell us, ‘for to-
morrow we may die,’
‘ Buy experience ’ —and we bought it—we’re ex-
perienced, you and I.”
Then, with a weary movement of his hand across
his brow:
“The death of such philosophy’s the death I’m
dying now.
“Cricket, football, gambling, racing, larks and
syrens, roaring sprees—
Pull yourself together, Peter, there are better
things than these !
When you feel your life is sinking in a dull and
useless course,
And begin to find in drinking keener pleasure—
and remorse—
When you feel the love of leisure on your careless
heart take holt,
Break away from friends and pleasure, tho’ it give
your heart a jolt.
Shun the poison breath of cities—billiard-rooms
and private bars,
Go where yon can breathe God’s air and see the
grandeur of the stars !
‘ Find again and follow up the old ambitions that
you had ”
[See if you can raise a drink, old man, I’m feelin’
mighty bad.]
“ Pull yourself together, Peter, ’tis the dyin’ wish
of Joe,
* That the business world shall honor Peter Ander-
son and Co.
Bid ’em bear me to the forest when I’ve smoked
to kingdom come—
Let me slumber ’neath the daisies—for my last
request is—rum.
Hot and sweeten’d, nip o’ butter—squeeze o’
lemon, Pete,” he sigh’d.
And, when Peter went to fetch it, Joseph went
to sleep—and died
With a smile —anticipation, maybe, of the peace to
come,
Or a joke to try on Peter—or, perhaps, it was the
rum.
Peter staggered, gripped the table, swerved as some
old drunkard swerves,
At a gulp he drank the toddy, just to brace his
shattered nerves.
It was awful, if you like. But then he hadn’t time
to think —
All is nothing! Nothing matters! Fill your
glasses—Dead man’s drink.
Yet, to show his heart was not of human decency
bereft,
Peter paid the undertaker. He got dnink on what
was left;
Then he shed some tears, half-maudlin, on the
grave where lay the Co.,
And he drifted to a township where the city
failures go.
Where, though haunted by the man he was, the
wreck he yet might be,
Or the man he might have been, or by each spectre
of the three,
And the dying words of Joseph, ringing through
his own despair,
Peter “ pulled himself together and he started busi-
ness ” there.
But his life was very lonely, and his heart was
very sad,
And no help to reformation was the company he
had—
Men who might have been, who had been, but who
weren’t in the swim—
’Twas a town of wrecks and failures—they appre-
ciated him.
They would ask him who the Co. was—that queer
company he kept—
And he'd always answer vaguely—he would say
his partner slept;
That he had a “sleeping partner”—jesting while
his spirit broke—
And they grinned above their glasses, for they
took it as a joke.
He would shout while he had money, he would
joke while he had breath—
No one seemed to care or notice how he drank him-
self to death.
Till at last there came a morning when his grin
was seen no more—
He was gone from out the office, and his shingle
from the door.
And a bound’ry-rider joggingout across the noigh-
b’ring run
Was attracted by a something that was blazing in
the sun ;
And he found that it was Peter, lying peacefully
at rest.
With a bottle close beside him and his shingle on
his breast.
Well, they analysed the bottle, and it would ap-
jiear that he
Qualified the drink with something good for
setting spirits free.
Though ’twas plain ’twas self-destruction—“’twas
his own affair,” they said.
And the jury viewed him sadly, and they found —
that he was dead.
And they “laid him ’neath a gum-tree”. Drink-
ing mates—inspired by rum—
Took the nlate in maudlin sorrow and they nailed
it to the gum—
(And the friendly hands were shaky as evinced by
many a dent) —
Nailed with nails of diff’rent breeds and sizes (most
of them were bent),
And for months the plate was polished 1 Wo are
tempted here to state
That the angels down from heaven came and
polished Peter’s plate—
Or the spirit of his partner. But ’twas rumored,
anyhow,
That 'twas polished every evening by a noighb’ring
cocky’s cow.
Twas a sheltered spot in winter when the flats
were bleak and dam]:) —
Cosy nook among the ranges where the cattle used
to camp
And perhaps some mangy horses. Let the gentle
reader choose
Twixt the angels and the cattle of the local cock-
atoos.
And the cattle went on camping till there wasn’t
any mound —
There was nothing save a dusty little hollow in
the ground.
There’s a chance the plate corroded and it fell off
bit by bit,
And was buried in the grasses, or the bark grew
over it—
Anyway, it disappeared. We have reason though
to think
That a wand’ring swaggy stole it and exchanged
it for a drink.
’Mongst the happy careless angels, loafing round in
promised land,
Some there will be who have “been there,” who
will smile and understand
When they see a spectre drifting (rather vaguely)
_up the aisle
With a brass-plate in his hand, and on his face a
lonesome smile —
They will know that it is Peter —having heard of
him no doubt—
And perhaps he’ll get a corner there to hang his
shingle out.
Where he’ll start again in business, and in part-
nership with Joe :
“Harp and crown and music-agents—Peter
Anderson and Co.”

The Wild-Cat Column .
The annual report of the Maoriland Government
Insurance Department is another solid evidence that
Stale Socialism, in this line of business, is a vast success.
For Ihe year, the department is-md 3301 policies com-
pared with 3204 last year and 2615 in 1892. The total
premiums for the year were £242,424, and the total in-
come, including interest on the invested funds, £369 478,
or mo f e than in 1893. Interest alone yielded
£115,270 —while the total claims by death and maturity
of endowments were barely £114,000. Over £135,000
was added to the funds during the year, making them,
apart from a large and solid reserve, £2,264 239. The
expenses, despite the fact that the Land and Income-tax
bear far more heavily on this institution than on any
other of its kind in Australasia, were only 15 per cent, of
the income—the smalltst rate in Australasia, ihat of the
A.M.P, Society alone excepted. Considering that the
JI.L. Government department charges the lowest pieminm
rates, one society alone excepted, in Australasia; that it
is the only concern of its kind where every policy is
guaranteed by the State ; and that it is economically
managed, and further supported by the second largest
insurance fund in these provinces, it is the ideal insurance
office of the world. Also, it is a solid evidence that State
management can be both cheaper and better than the
private article.

Goldshrougb, Morfc and Co.’s British debenture-
holders have accepted the proposed re-arrangement,
whereby they are to get 4 per cent, on one-half their
liability and 3 per cent, on the other half, making 3i
instead of 5 per cent, all round. The 3 per cent., also, is
to be pdd only if earned. Considering present interest
rates, 31 per cent, is certainly abundant, while the pre-
vious 6 per cent. was ridiculously extravagant. The new
arrangement will save the co., even if all interest is paid
in full, about £38,000 a year in debenture inten st, and
perhaps £30,000 more in interest on bank overdrafts and
other outlays. As it is announceel that the next
balance sheet will show £60,000 less, it, is evidei t that
a re-construction was inevitable. The banks which hold
the co.’s overdraft agree to accept one-third of their
debt in debentures. G. 51. and Co. are pnslora'ists on an
immense scale, and a reduction of Id. per lb. in wool
means £BO,OOO a year vanished out of the profits—her oe
the recent troubles. Another period of even reasonably
go; d prices would restore this solid and well managed
institution to its former prosperity. Meanwhile, three
large shareholders Inve announced their intention of
paying their calls, amounting to £280,000, in one lump,
and taking preference shares, as provided by the sell* me
of arrangement, and it. is expected that £600,000 will be
received from shareholders in the course of a few months.

The British depositors having proved utterly
unmanageable, the City of Melbourne Bank closed its
doors last week. There is talk of a possible re-opening,
but the chances are 100 to 1 against it. Looked at from a
purely business standpoint, the institution is much belter
dead. It bad hardly em ugh business latterly to pay
expenses, yet its existence helped to intensify the com
petition. Its deposits were almost wholly English, so
most of its interest, payments went out of the country,
and its closure slops an outflow of £120,000 per annum.
If the British depositors had accepted the offers made to
them, it is just possible that they would have got the
whole of their £2,750,000 in the end, whereas by liquida-
ting they will probably get about half of it, so that one
item of Australia’s foreign indebtedness will he wiped off
at a cheap rate. The shareholders won't lose much in
calls, for past experience has shown that they
are a very unpromising lot to extract calls
from, and, meanwhile, the attempt to collect them
may afford profitable employment to somebody. They
won’t lose much in the way of dividends either,
for there was no visible prospect cf any divs. for
many years to come, and their capital—which wasn’t
much—was practically gone already. Also, there is just
a chance that the fate of the City of Melb. Bank, which
burst through its British deposits, may help to prevent
other banks rushing, in the same insensate fashion, after
British capital, and that the less of the British dep sitors
may scare some of them off this country for the future.
Apart from the melancholy fact that about 70 people are
thrown out of employment, the result is a thing to be
thankful for in every respect.
Already it looks as if there was going to be a
desperate struggle to smother possible “ revelations ” in
re the City of Melbourne Bank. It was known about 9.45
on Wednesday morning that the British creditors were
going to demand a liquidation order, hut instead of
waiting for the inevitable the board look such exceed-
ingly active steps that by 10.30 the Attornev-General
hurst into Judge Hood’s court and obtained an order
on tile hoard’s own petition. He also turned up
befor- the C.J. with a second petition by a private share-
holder, and shortly afterwards he arrived again b< fore
Judge Hood and secured the appointment of the board’s
nominee as liquidator. A few hours afterwards lie turned
up again as the representative of the British ci editors and
wailed to the eff* ot tbat. it was an absurdity to appoint the
directors’ nominee to inquire into the directors’ alleged
mismanagement, and demanded the appointment of
Dtn-ker as liquidator, hut lire Court declim d to alter the
arrangement already made. Evidently tire slow-going
British cnditor dorsn’t understand yet the velocity of
which a Melbourne director is capable at a crisis, or he
would have climbed over tire hoard’s dead body to get
his petition in first.
Fivo minutes after the City of Melb. Bank
closed its doors, a youthful lover of tire naked truth bad
chalkeel on its walls near the door lire legend “ BUNG I "
The Colonial Bank would almost certainly have
met with a similar fate, only that it wisely abjured
British dipositors altogether. And now, if the board
has any sense of gratitude, it will hold a special service of
thanksgiving for its escape, and set apart a day for a
great orgy among the staff, and Swilliarn Claike. if a
really grateful man, will let off rockets, and set a barrel
of tar on lire, and bold a notable dog-flght on the lawn in
front of his big mansion.
Over .£300,000 of the money which the Melb.
Metropolitan Board of Works borrowed at au exorbitant
rate in England is in the City of Melbourne Bank. If
that Institution pans out for 10s. in the £ the Board's
financing will cost the people of Melbourne £150,000 in
immediate cash and £6700 a year interest thereon for the
next half-century or so.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION. ,
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying th<
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
tiimnphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled O its is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of

Maoriland Govt, reckons on a surplus next year
of just. £9357. The estimated revenue is 165,000 less
than last year, and the estimated expenditure 165,0 0
more. If these figures prove correct the beautiful
Treasurer Ward is getting dangerously near to having a
deficit instead of a surplus. In Maoriland the surplus is
the only support of t lie Public Works Fund; if it slops
the fund necessarily breaks down, and then the borrowing
disease will probably start afresh.

The Royal Bank of Queensland still lives up to
Its reputation as a sound and well-managed concern. Its
profits for the half-year are £5946 against 16476 last half,
and £6360 the one before. It, pays its usual dividend at
the rate of 2t) per cent, per annum, adds £l5OO to reserve,
making it £28,500; and has a balance of £7051 still to
credit of profit and loss. The coin, bullion, Govt, securi-
ties, and Treasury notes ( 1245,444) equal 31 per cent, of
the entire liabilities to the public. Theßo.vnl, by I lie
terms of its reconstruction scheme, lias to carry to reserve
regularly cue-fourth of its profits, and it is a great pity
that the same wise provision does not apply to all other
banks. Ttie balance-sheet lumps together, after the
usual heterogeneous fashion, current accounts, recon-
structed deposits, and new fixed deposits, and in other
respects it gives about the same amount of information
as usual. So far ns the information goes, however, it
looks remarkably well.

The South Australian Insurance Co. pays its
usual dividend of 10 per cent, for the year (equal to

an excellent j ear’s work.

At the Commercial Bank of Australia’s meeting
a bird of ill omen named Gillolt got, up to remark that
*'further reconstruction must he carried out hecaus it
was impossible for the hank to pay ail its debts within the
five years prescribed by the reconstruction scheme;” If
the idea is that every depositor will take his money when
it comes due and carry it away in a hag, it is quite
probable that neither the Commercial nor a good many
other hanks could stand the shock. Hut the chances are
that, so long as Gyles Turner’s institution seems able to
pay the 4) per cent, regularly, it will have to make its
depositors remove their money by brute force. The
depositor only wants his money when he thinks he can’t
get it; if he can get it, then lie would rattier not have it,
and wants the interest instead. When it looked as if tlie
City of Melbourne couldn’t pay, the depositors wanted
their cash in less than half an instant; hut when the Vic-
toria recently released an instalment, it was almost ail
re-deposited at a lower rate of interest. Hanking is a
curious science, which depends mainly on the fact that
mvi always wants immediately the thing lie can’t get,
and doesn't care a straw for the tiling he can have at any
time.

of £5OOO and £1994 to credit of profit and loss; and its

reduced its overdraft by £569 during the year ; it Inis a

£3561 to credit, of profit, and loss, and it seems economi-
cally and carefully managed. Hut a concern, however
sound, with £0825 of paid-up capital, is a very small pot

small dividends for a good while to come, and set itself to

All Much property is exempt, and where either widow
or widower takes a life interest in property yielding
a yearly income of less than £5OO, collection of the duty
is postponed until the death of the life tenant. So the
Treasurer proposes to abolish all exemptions on all pro-
perty devolving upon a wife or husband, barring estates

Melb. Jews say that a spunky pawnbroker
holding out for 12 months is sure of a fortune, Vic,
pawnbrokers’ recognised 80% interest-ride is calculated
on half-crown loans. A man gelling 2s. 6d. on a pledge
pays 2d. a month interest; anything over 2s. 6d. and
under ss. pays 4d. In other words, the charge is 2d. per
month on every half-crown or part of half-crown. Small
advances, therefore, pay the broker best—as the workman
scon finds out. An unfortunate mechanic forced to pawn
his tools one by one receives, p rhaps, on a chi-el 3d. ; on
a plane, 4d ; on a saw, 61. U •is charged in e ich case (he
full interest on 2s. 6 1., and by the time his whole kit is
“up t.ie spout,” though he may not have had half-a-
crown da the lot, lie will have to pay a 500 per cent,
redemption penalty. In England 25% is charged on the
same basis, the average for European countries being
about 121%. After the State Hank, the Slate Trustee,
and the State Grog-shop, must come the Slate Pawn-shop.

When Mr. Patton introduced the system of
squ ire set timbering with Oregon into the Broken
Hill mine, he said he adopted this method because
filling in w ith surface mullock (as cosily a work,
lie aided, as the breaking of the ore) would he
avoided. Very soon, however, it was found that filling-in
was still necessary. Mr. Zeb. Lane was the first to pro
minently insist upon the absolute necessity of it; audio
that policy, pursued under his ninnagem nt and ever
since, is to he ascribed the fact that Block 14 lias siood fast
while serious movements were occurring on both sides.
The collapse of the British, costing, according to some
estimates, £BO,OOO, proved once for nil that, no matter
how much timber might he put in, a Broken Hill-mine
would cave in if the workings were not “mullocked up.”
The new si stem of limbering was, however, pretty to look
at and the nice sawn limb r was easy lo handle ; so the
system has not been seriously challenged since, notwith-
standing that it failed so utterly to do the work which
Mr. Patton expected from it.
One proposal made some years ago, and now
likely to he revived, is to substitute concrete pillars for
timber in the B.H. mines, slag being the base of the con-
crete. Some Adelaide people (they afterwards established
the cement works at Marino) first put this proposal for-
ward. Their claim, they say, was jumped by a Sydney
syndicate, which did nothing hut spend ah its capital.
The Proprietary Co. alone has been paying over £100,090

regarding possible Tasmanian supplies of hardwood;
but. shortly afterwards Mr. Patton came along lo knock
that idea on the head.

Proprietary ore is insignificant as compared with the

him. The nugget was very ugly—a mere coarse clot of
gold with no more beauty than a bullock’s liver. As far
as the present writer knows, Westtalia has produced no
nugget bigger than 950 z. The Yandoit nugget, had it
been found in Westralia, might, have led on a rush of 5000

good mines in the district, which, if capitalised and

A mining boom is on in Auckland province
(M.L.) owing, principally, to the attention of British
capitalists and spectators having been attracted
by the rich yields from the Hauraki Co.’s mine at
Coromandel, and the Wailii Co.’s mine. Upper Thames.
Since Ist O t. last £65,000 bullion has been won from the
former mine. The Wailii has yielded during the present
year £60,742, and last year £83,023.
A number ot Coromandel properties have been
floated in London on the strength of the Hauraki output.
Some have good prospects of success, hut the field is noto-
riously patchy, and there are likely to lie many failutes.
Fifteen claims have also been floated in Auckland - iii
some instances with the idea that British co.’s will even-
tually buy.
Messrs. Byles (a mining expert), Roth well
(panner in a London firm of stock-brokers), and Well-
stead (an English capitalist) lately inspected several Upper
Thames properties which are being placed in London on
terms which should prove very satisfactory to the present
shareholders. These mines have all been considerably
d velnped, are yielding bullion, and will at hast, give the
shareholders a for run. The Held is extensive, hut, the
slom> is not rich. The bullion v aries greatly in quality,
Woodstock being worth about 95.; Wailekann,2ls.; Wailiq
275.; Cronri. 355. Though most of whatever profits may
he mad 1 will go into Brilisli pockets, the winning of the
bullion, especially in the low-grade Upper Thames district,
w ill give much employment. Twice in the past the failing
fortunes of ttie Auckland province have been retrieved
by a mining r rival. And th-re is every indication that
the i xperience will again be repeated.
Hauraki shares, 2s. Cd. paid, are quoted in Lon-
don at 15s. A small parcel changed hat <ls in Auckland
at 20s. The co. is a most entirely British, and, until a
f> tv months ago, there was only one shareholder in the
pioxince, hut some thousands of shares have since been
bought by Aucklanders. .None of the local men sue-
Deeded in getting in at much under 10s. There art
320,000 sliares in the co.
A year ago Wailii sliares stood at 335. ; they are
now quoted at £7. This makes tlie market-value of the
mine £1.120,000, but £'250,000 is probably nearer ill
value. Very few shares are now held in M.L., London
purchasers having, some months ago, bought all obtain-
able shares at figures much uud r present, quotation. The
co. has a big body of stone, hut it is very doubtful
whether returns will balance present stock-price.
Some yields for July ; Hauraki, Coromandel,
value £9900; Kapanga, Coromandel, £1438; Waihi,
Upper Thames, £9581; Waitekattri, Upper Thames,
£1117; Woodstock, Upper Thames, £988; May Queen,
Thames, £1854 ; Try Fluke, Kuaotunu, £676; Kauai Ver-
mont, Kuaolumi, £2235.
At last the Thames deep levels are to be pro-
perly tested, a London co., working capital > 90,000, having
been formed for that purpose. Work will he commenced
On the Queen of Beauty ground.
The Silverton mine, floated in England a few
months ago as I h >J Waihi Silverlon, is looking well, and is
likely to pay. The properly had le-eii long under offer,
and was only floated on the last day given to the agent.
It is reported that Col. North makes 116,000 over the
deal, 16000 of British money has been spent on the pro-
perly during the last four months.
The Waihi has struck the reef, at the lower
level opened up six months ago; quality of the stone is
much better than that at preset l obtained fr< in the higher
le\el. This was anticipated, but its realization should
give fresh impetus to the mining revival.

Out. in one of the south-western parts of
N.S. Wales there is an immense plain, and in over
100 square miles of dead-level surface one tree
forms the only break in the monotony. Apart
from it there is hardly even a shrub or a twig in a
long day’s ride. A few years ago an old resident
of the locality was driving across this howling
waste -in open- daylight at midsummer, and by
some misadventure, which he never has been able
to explain, he wrecked his buggy against that
tree, maimed his horse, broke his harness in
several places, and dislocated himself considerably.
All the Marine Board inquiry in the world would
never have revealed how he did it. This is
probably the way the Catterthun got on to the
Seal Rocks, only as her misadventure took place
at night instead of in broad daylight, it is all
the less unaccountable. The Board will doubtless
find that she arrived at her lamentable end through
the course being altered prematurely, or not altered
in time, so that she was going in the wrong direc-
tion—as no vessel ever arrives at the wrong place
except by going in the wrong direction, this is a
thoroughly gafe assumption. The settler who, in
his sober senses and in broad daylight, drove into
the only tree within 100 square miles, got there
from the same cause. But this explanation doesn’t
explain how either of them happened to go in
the wrong direction.
The cussedness of objects inanimate probably
has a good deal to do with such mishaps, and bad
luck has a good deal more. The writer once came
across a beautiful illustration of the latter cause.
He was troubled with nocturnal blindness, and
for some weeks he used to get home late at night
along a very quiet road on the outskirts of a very
quiet town, principally by groping his way
along the fences. One night he put a hand
out suddenly to feel for the fence and struck a

fndy a tremendous whack on the mouth —the only
1 idy probably who had come along that way at
that hour any time in six months or more. Ten
minutes of copious explanation in the middle of
the road left her still unconvinced, and when at
last she went on her hysterical way to tell the
story to her male relations her assailant had lost
hi a, sense of direction utterly, and had to make a
fresh start at random. If he had been the Catter-
thun and she had been the one "small rock in a six
months’ voyage, there would have been a high-
class wreck that night.
On the evening of the wreck some of the people
on board the Catterthffn got talking of the
Wairarapa disaster, and the chief officer remarked :
“I have quite made up my mind that whatever
death I die I will not be drowned.” Next morning
he was among the missing, but he may yet turn
up floating on a hen-coop somewhere ; the opti-
mist seldom gets drowned. Captain Fawkes, the
pilot, who hung on to a board in a cold, stormy
sea, and cheerfully told the man on the other end
of the plank to “ keep his pecker up,” is a case in
point.
Already about 10 people have been heard of who
just missed sailing by the Catterthun through a
variety of remarkable causes. About this number
of people always just miss sailing in every vessel
which is lost, so presumably an eqdal number miss
the one which gets safely to its destination. From
these data The Bulletin roughly estimates that
every year over 100,000 Australians miss their
passages and are accidentally left behind. Evi-
dently we are a beastly unpunctual race.
# * *
Most of the lady passengers by the Catter-
thun seem to have been too terrified to leave the
saloon, and they drowned there. So far as the
evidence goes the Chinese and other Asiatics who
formed the crew behaved remarkably well ; but
there were only a few minutes in which to do any-
thing, the night was dark and stormy, all the
boats save one were smashed by the heavy seas,
and in every possible respect luck was against the
unfortunate ship. Also, though every possible
survivor seems to have been persistently inter-
viewed no one seems able to explain how the
Catterthun contrived to get so far out of her course.
The gale, at all events, cannot be held responsible,
for it would tend to drive her further out to sea
rather than to force her in-shore. Moreover, there
are two lighthouses in the immediate vicinity of
the disaster. So far there are not even the usual
number of picturesque incidents to relate—pro-
bably because no one had time to be picturesque.
Probably the best one up to date is that told by
Capt. Fawkes, the Torres Straits pilot, who bor-
rowed the captain’s knife to cut a table adrift.
He went overboard with it in his hand, and as he
sank it occurred to him that he would like to
preserve the knife as a memento, so he put it in
his pocket. AVhich is strongly suggestive of Mr.
Wemmick, who always held on to Portable Pro-
perty, even under adverse circumstances,

The message on the billy is a familiar
pl an with entombed miners. The writer was
trucking in a Vic. mine, about 13 veara ago, when
r i r ... . ... ’i ■ m i ■
a Cousin .lack faceman was trapped m a i- drive.
They were 50 hours getting at him, and when the
victim was dragged out he looked as if he had
been in a month. “How long have I been in
here, men?” he asked. He was told. “Thee|s
lyin’ to me,” he said ; “aw counted 10 days.” His
billy was brought on top after he was taken home,
and the boss of the shift and the engine-driver
spent an hour trying to decipher the message
scratched upon it. At last it panned out :
“Praetor, I did steal they ducks, and may the
Lord have mercy on me. Amen ! ”

The men entombed in the M‘Evoy mine
at Eldorado, Vic., burnt all their caudles. They
evidently recognised from the first the impossi-
bility of a rescue, otherwise they would have
extinguished their caudles. Every miner knows
that it is wise to put out his light when trapped,
and reserve all the air for his own consumption—
or, if there is air enough, to save the candle for a
possible meal. The M’Evoy miners seem to
have looked the situation in the face, and resolved
to have it over as quickly as possible.

It looks as though Acting-Gov. Madden
may need to be placed under proper control before
bis hour of greatness has expired. His sense, of
the eternal fitness of things as regards vice-regal
performances seems to begin and end with a serio-
comic “make-up.” In a burst of enthusiasm
Excellency Madden stuck his signature at the
head of a requisition to the O’Hara, desiring that
athletic citizen to stand for the position of indoor
surgeon at Melb. Hospital. Such displays of
partisanship—for the Hospital election is gener-
ally a fierce struggle between rival practitioners—
ill become a deputy-royal personage, and ought to
be promptly suppressed.

Mrs. Governor Madden’s hysterical glori-
fication of debutantes at Government House has
added a new horror to Melb. life. Local papers
publish portraits of these young women. Every
fond mocher in the district is laying plans to get
her budding daughter “presented ” as soon as
possible, because she’s certain that the dear child
can’t suffer by comparison with several of the
visions that have already got into print. The
average picture of a debutante seems calculated to
console any aged buck for the loss of his dancing
days.
# • #
In their Guvmentouse dances the Maddens
have been trying to improve on private secretary
Wallington’s methods. The result has been
disaster. Instead of inviting all from the same
district at a time, they proceeded alphabetically,
thus upsetting all the neighborly cliques of the
Hopetoun rigime. And the dais exhibition of
debutantes was unpopular, too; but their worst
blunder was the supper, which even the Argus
distinctly reflected on. Sassiety won’t wag its
tail without cakes, and so for the second dance
there were 400 refusals.

'Victoria's Acting-Governor is making the

In Morrison’s “ Tales of Mean Streets ” is
a story of two women, mother and daughter,
named Perkins. From being in a position of
comfort their little possessions gradually go from
them, the piano first, until in the end, having col-
lapsed through utter destitution, they are found
by their neighbors after being dead some days.
All of which, without exception—name, circum-
stances and relationship—fit the deaths of Mrs.
Perkins and her daughter at South Melb. about
the beginning of the year. Unconscious cerebra-
tion or coincidence —which ?

Minnie Dean, the Maoriland baby-farmer,
according to a recent Dunedin paper, is getting a
new and very becoming dress to be hanged in.
She eats well, sleeps well, and talks pleasantly to
her visitors about all manner of subjects, including
her trial and execution. “ Hanging has no terrors
for her,” says the local scribe, “and she is not at
times averse to a mild joke on the subject.” No
doubt, to that rare woman who has a genuine
sense of humor, there is something wildly ridi-
culous about an execution, even her own execu-
tion. Just here the question arises; What does
the alleged deterrent effect of capital punishment
amount to in the case of a woman who gets a new
and very becoming dress to bo hanged in ?

A N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge, last
week, suggested that two litigants, fighting over
about half-a-square-foot of land, should toss-
up” for it. Is this the Full Court’s answer to the
“ Anti-Gambling Demonstrations ? ”
The wife of a
big-hearted Mel-
bourne journalist,
after gratuitously
entertaining, a t

four of her hus-
band’s “ picked-
up ” literary
friends for periods
ranging from a

The widow of
a big Melb. land-

remarkably far-
seeing, and 40

an outlying subur-

always believed it
would prove a
gold-mine, and
held on right
through a host of
difficulties. At
last came the
boom. “Told you
so !’’ and he
pocketed over
,£30,000. With
that he went to
Paris, and died of
joy. The balloon
afterwards burst,
and the money
having been wisely
invested in Melb.
securities, every
penny went. Now
the widow goes to join him, with the news.

Maoriland hospital nurses are coining on.
Their demand that all head-nurses lie called
“ Sister ’’was first granted. Asked whether t.iey
would prefer to append their Christian or sur-
names to this handle, they answered Christ ian.”
.So when some rude kid remarks, “ Sister Mary
walks like that,” the nurse will understand that
the fault is her own. One boorish trustee then
proposed that male attendants should he called
“Brother,” and the matron “Mother,” and the
doctor “Father John,” and then the trustees
might drop in as “Grandpa,” with the secretary
as “Uncle.” The “Sisters” said he was a very
nasty man. But, really, is not the whole system
of uniforms and “Sisters” and things nothing
more than a sickly imitation of the nunnery, or
else a copy of that silly custom that men have of
sticking on blue aprons and tin regalia, and then
calling erfch other Lord High Knights and Right
Worshipful Nincompoops, and things like that?

The Melb. divorce-case, wherein ib was
alleged that the woman had misbehaved herself
with the co-respondent, a butcher, in the refriger-
ating chamber attached to the shop, somewhat
recalls the case of a certain Australian hospital
nurse who, having an extensive amatory corres-
pondence, was in the habit of repairing to the
hospital dead-house to read her letters. Passion
in a freezing chamber! Australia is a great
country.
The tremendous in the Butler con-
spiracy case, at Sydney, was in no small degree,
it would appear, brought about by a vendetta
between two divorce-detectives.

Mrs. Butler’s brother, now under sentence
for perjury, is the unfortunate whom Mr. Justice
Windeyer knew to be guilty of perjury “ because
he shuffled his feet while in the witness-box.”
The learned Judge cited excellent authorities in
proof of this theory that shuffling the feet is an
indubitable proof of lying, and then committed
Butler for perjury. And yet the foot-test, despite
its great antiquity, has shown itself as unreliable
as Dr. M'Oarthy’s more modern door-test. So
long as arbitrary Judges suffer themselves to be
in any way influenced by such fads s trial by jury,
faulty though it is, must remain immeasurably pre-
ferable to trial by Judge.

The Vic. authorities have of late been
doing their best to form a Hebrew colony in
Pcntiidge prison. But it is safe to predict that
when the Chosen again breathe the air of freedom
their very first move will be to apply for the
sequestration of the estates of the gaol officials,
who by then are bound to be heavily in their debt.
That they will still contrive to trade and take
down the Gentile admits of no manner of doubt.

This farmer owns close upon 2000 acres of land, and
gets £2l per week for his milk. The men’s hut is a
wretched hovel, so draughty that we could hardly keep a

venience of .any description, not even a tin-disb to wash
in. I and three other men had to rise at 4.30 a.m., milk
.26 cow’s" %’ch,' then wash up cans and buckets. After this,
breakfast (sait meat, dry bread, tea). Sinking post holes
in stony ground till dinner-time (for dinner, salt mutton,
potatoes, rice, water). More post-holes till milking (4.30).
At 7.30 supper (corned “junk,”, bread, treacle, tea).
Then mix up cows’feed for nex( morning. Finished the
day’s work at B.3o—about 98 hours a week for 10s.

Mr. Justice Simpson deprecates, in the
interests of a “ most repectable body of men,” the
application of the term “ detect! ve ” to persons,
some of whom, lie has just discovered with amaze-
ment, “ would apparently stop at nothing !” But
isn’t this lamb-like innocence of the Bench a little
unconvincing—considering that the unscrupulous
scoundrelisrn of the divorce-evidence-jackal is as
commonly notorious as the fact that a good many
of Judge Simpson’s “respectable men” (from
whose ranks the private detective very often
comes) also will “stop at nothing” to secure a
conviction. Still, as the official “D” is under
responsibilities entirely lacking in the case of the
private inquiry man, why not place the latter
under license, promptly forfeitable for malpractice
by himself or his creatures?

Melbourne Mayor Snowden’s one fierce

Photo. by Mendelssohn.
The slaughtered Lady Missionaries. The Misses SAUNDERS (late of Melbourne)
and their mother.
Salmon Wilson. What he wants to commemorate
in the late knight of Eroildoune nobody really
knows. All Wilson did was to fail in acclima-
tising Angora goats, ostriches and salmon, and to
succeed with axis deer. He also accumulated
much money from Australian sources, and care-
fully spent most of it at the other side of the
world. Being but a little pot of sounding brass,
he wanted a long handle, and got it by paying
some £30,000 to Melb. University to build a big
and useless hall. Also, bis money got several of
bis family married into swell but impecunious
families. One prominent lady, bothered by
Snowden at a Govt. House function about this
memorial project, gave him a prompt and decisive
retort courteous : “ If Sir Samuel Wilson’s family
arid friends think a memorial to him desirable,
then they are quite well enough off to pay for it
themselves without bothering the public!” Said
a distinguished member of Melb. University :
“ Snowden getting up a memorial to Wilson ?
Humph ! One nobody commemorating another
nobody—and Snowden is such a nobody.” And
the congregation softly sighed “ Amen ! ”

According to Dr. W. L. Mullen, of Melb.,
nine or ten years ago it was the regular thing for
a new arrival, or a fresh local M. 8., to take in his
first two years fees amounting in the gross to

country town, and in five years had netted
<£16,000. Nowadays, the man who can make
,£5OO a year in Melbourne has good cause to crow.
The passengers on an Adelaide to Mel-
bourne train had a breezy adventure, the other
dav. The driver, who was peacefully drunk
during the earlier part of the journey, suddenly
developed a fine case of the horrors after leaving
Nhill, and started trying to outrun a hairy green
devil with a blue tail who was pursuing him along
the rails. Then for about eight minutes the train
bumped along at a tremendous pace, and pas-
sengers were thrown on the carriage floors and
against the roofs, and everybody had his hair full
of travelling-bags and hat-boxes and umbrellas
which flew off the racks and moved around in all
directions. Meanwhile the fireman and driver
were having a joyous free fight for the possession
of the engine, and the latter being finally laid
out with a crowbar the train was pulled up and
the circus terminated. Some appropriate re-
marks about the accursed drink are held over for

LOOKING BACKWARDS.
Upon the glimmering seascape low
I see her face divine,
And in the rippling wavelets slow
Her azure glances shine.
Behind the purple dusk of even
Her paler form appears ;
Her whisper hushes in the heaven
The music of the spheres.
’Tis all a shadow that I see,
A form unreal and vain ;
For long ago she passed from me
And left me to my pain.
Too pure, too radiant white she gleamed
For love’s tumultuous glow ;
So tender and so frail, it seemed
She only came to go.
Her lily’s life was but begun
When God, who loved her best,
Took her, a maid unwoo’d, unwon,
To His scarce brighter breast.

O'er wind-piled weeds I feel her breath
As we tread thro’ a shingled strand.
How well I can banish the fear of death,
Just by holding her dear white hand !
There’s a drug for the pain of life
And a chance in eternity ;
So I catch at frail Lilian, my wife,
And hurry along to the sea.
One long kiss in the velvet dark,
While the life’s on your trembling lip :
Together we’ll lie in the depths that mark
The lashing white wake of a ship.

Hygiene teaches that nothing is so bene-

ourselves in a clean condition, which ought to be
the first aim of every individual with any esteem
for himself. The use of Amykos has proved to be
very important to this end, by its great sanitary

My Dear Moorabinda—
The Rev. Chad band’s moan of horror over
the birth-markon the “Shop Girl ” has been sud-
denly squelched by the missionary massacres in
China which have filled the papers for the last
few days, and set the “religious” world sending
black-edged cards to the various sections of itself,
and buying its cabbagee from Caucasians until the
thrill wears off. It is certainly dreadful reading,
conveying to the frivolous worldling the idea that
the Deity is not in touch with the Zenana mission
and the Church Society. Yet these institutions
will not take what looks to an outsider like the
very broadest hint from head-quarters, but will
continue sending young men and women to use-
lessly preach a strange doctrine, at great expense,
to a large, bland, apathetic yellow nation which
wouldn’t buck up spiritually even if the Pope him-
self went itinerating. Heaven is not a British
institution, and English-speaking people are not
responsible for the state of soul of a dun-colored
heathen planting cabbagee on the borders of
Russia; but still they will go out and try a fall, as
it were, with Confucius, and they never seem to
think when they get knocked out that, after all, the
money mayn’t be all behind them, as the sporting
men say. But these little suggestions that they
aren’t Wanted in that corner of the vineyard work
just the opposite way with the missionary party.
The certain result of this holocaust will be hordes
of hysterical pietists breaking their necks to win
bold advt. and martyrs’ haloes abroad, while their
own back-alley probably spells God with the
smallest of g’s.
Mark Twain, and his wife and daughters, are
now eii route from Vancouver to Sydney, where
M. T. starts his Australian lecture-tour, under the
aegis of the Most Travelled—at least, they were to
come by the VVarrimoo. I am prepared to find
Mark a disappointment—he cannot be so enter-
taining as his books. A book has the same
advantage over the writer as hidden music has
over a fat, oily tenor, with short arms, howling in
the open—the musio may be the same, but the
entourage destroys the bouquet and distracts your
attention. You cannot picture an ideal Mark
Twain—your fancy patches up a weird impos-
sibility with a poet’s hair, a cynic’s eye, an artist’s
hands, a wit’s profile, and a low-comedian’s feet —
and the reality will perhaps be n-iyiniscent of
Pastor Haweis. There is only one thirty I will
not forgive Mark Twain. 1 will not forgive jiim
if he only suggests “ Mr. Clemens.”
The Wibbigilla (or, words to that effect) dance,
got up by ’Varsity students at Need’s rooms
last Thursday, was in every way successful
—partly, I think, because it is so new, in
this day of charity festivals, to go and
dance purely for your own amusement, and not
to provide toothpicks for converted Chinese or
something of the sort. The place was stiff with
nice frocks, and if the prettiest turn-out was a
pale-blue satin and chiffon gown, with little blue
shoes and cheeky forget-me-nots in her hair, still,
a pale-yellow silk with snowdrops on top, worn by a
fine-looking Melbourne girl, made a close second.
Indeed, the field finished in a heap, as you may
say, for a dark-eyed double of Miss Inez Bensusan
in pale-blue silk with lace and blush ruses ran up
well; and the only really unpleasing turn-out was
that of a damsel in a very decollete take-poison-
in-the-limelight frock of white satin, green velvet,
and tea-colored lace. It was an ideal gown in
which to play the first act of a “Woman with a
Past ’’—the sort of garment which looks lively
with a cigarette, and completely out of place
on a well-meaning citizen at a students’ dance.
Miss “ Seven Little Australians ” Turner (who is
engaged to Mr. Curlewis, of the Sydney legal
brigade) wore a simply-girlish frock of white
cr£pon with scarlet poppies sealing her corsage, as
it were. Besides being so prettily dressed, the
wibbly-wobbly dance introduced the fashion of
having dance-programme and admission-ticket
on the same card—an economy that secretaries of
charity dances would do well to follow, if it
would work on a large scale.
Sydney Suburban Bicycle Club and the Dar
linghurst Harriers announce their intention of
holding a ball at West’s rooms on 22nd inst. Mr.
W. Kerr and Mr. Brierley are secretaries to what
promises to be a very smart little hop. And,
talking of dancing, reminds me that I have re-
ceived a waltz from W. H. Paling and Co. en-
titled “ The Venus,” by Madame Terlier. It is a
very chirrupy and melodious waltz with a certain
—shall I say—fretfulness about it that is piquant.
I like the “Venus;” it is so Frenchy, for one
thing. From Melbourne Miss Louisa Clarke
sends “ La Vision ” skirt-dance, dedicated to one
of the noble army of Melbourne amateur high-
kickers. I don’t know how it would go with the
skirt, but going alone the trifling music does not
leave a deep impression.
I hear that “ Lady ” was taken in hand,
some little time ago (at the instigation of a
Governor’s wife, I believe), by the Sydney Church
Home people, who thought to make a big ad. out
of Australia’s most notorious female character by
leading her gently back into the paths of repent-
ance. Their ill-success was the more disappoint-
ing because, while in the Home, Lady ’s
natural refinement came out on top and her
behaviour the whole time was absolutely perfect—
it was not possible to find fault with her. How-
ever, the Church Home should have had more
experience of human nature than to be buoyed up
by that. If a real work of reformation had begun
Lady would have been a little restive —to
say the least of it—now and then. The woman
who behaves perfectly while her whole life is
being stood on its head only means to endure it so
long as it suits her.
It strikes me that “Ladies ” would be
painfully frequent in the streets of the Australian
capitals if patient male relatives didn’t turn their
homes into inebriate-asylums to shelter them. It
happened recently, at a certain fashionable
Southern store, that a society lady rolled up in
her carriage and dived into the refreshment-room,
where she sat and imbibed a couple of bottles of
wine. When she rose she began to stagger and
daw the air for support in so alarming a manner
that an attendant (not altogether unused to such
crises) escorted her, with difficulty, to the lift, and
thence to her carriage, in which she bowled home
with her bonnet sideways and herfeeton the front
seat—a solemn warning to her tippling friends.
Sydney, also, is not without its share of red-faced
women who smell of corks. ■
There is a huge station-property in the droughty
Australian West where they do things in heavy
style—reminiscent of Lonnen’s “We dine at
sa-a-ven; whether there’s any dinner or not.”
Evening-dress is an of course, and. when the
rouseabout, disguised as a butler, announces dinner
served, the animals go in two by two d la Putts
Point. There everything is the usual silver-
smith’s show—and all is lovely but the bill of
fare. Salt horse, boiled potatoes, and pumpkin
cannot very well be disguised in even menu-
French,
Apropos of style in the back-blocks, a Bourke
correspondent tells me that black dress ties have
just reached Bourke, and asks me why men have
taken to them, repudiating the old white choker?
It is so long ago and men’s fashions are generally
so unreasonable (if anybody objects to this I only
point silently at sheep-hurdle collars which saw
their ear-lobes, and silk hats in summer) that I
scarcely remember; but I believe the first idea
was to distinguish the guest from the waiter.
Then, in Sydney, people pretended they wore
black haberdashery as mourning for the late
Governor. The only people who wear them in
town now are people who make a point of wearing
their clothes right out.
Mr. Malone, the popular Gee-Gee manager, has
had a heavenly time (from a strictly feminine
pbint of view) since the score of “ Gentleman
Joe ” came to hand. He has had all the costumes
to fix up for the new production (which arrived
with no instructions as to business or dressing, by
the way). People who pump-handled Mr. Malone
last week were left with little bits of frivolous
feminine materials in their grasp, and odds and
ends of pink silk and other dress patterns might
have been observed bulging out of his pockets.
The “Gentleman Joe” dresses are going to be
gorgeous, so they say, and so they ought to be if
a hungry craving for patterns on the managerial
part is any criterion.
This rush of new gowns is a nuisance to the
Gee-Gees, who pass hours at the frock-builder’s,
which might be more amusingly (I won’t say
profitably) passed elsewhere. Pretty Grace
Palotta found the rag-rush too much for her last
Thursday, and fainted at David Jones’, to the
consternation of everybody in the vicinity. I hear
that the rush for sal volatile and other (stimulants
was nothing short of a stampede—the men flying
for restoratives, while the women soaked her face
with water, hoping to see some of her fresh com-
plexion slipping, I suppose—but it didn’t. If you
really want to prove that your color is your very
own, there’s nothing like fainting when there are
women about. Though I don’t suppose, for in-
stance, that cold water would fetch off much color
from the face of a certain stalwart actress whom
we all know. It looks as if only sand-paper would
be equal to that.
“ The Shop Girl ” prospers at Sydney Lyceum,
despite its reputation for a certain malodorous-
ness of text here and there—though in one in-
stance the present play scores one for gracefully
waiving a rare chance to be suggestive. I mean
where Sir George Appleby (Cecil Hope, who
means to try his luck at later on) re-
marks : “Good Heavens ! is this my sou ? ” No-
body even winks or coughs here. The stage feel-
ing following this leading remark is absolutely
correct, and, I think, atones in part for the much-
discussed strawberry-mark dialogue, or Blanche
Massey’s reply to the question : “Does he take
your temperature?” “He takes everything."
The new polyglot (Hobson and “'Dolly ”) in
“ The Shop Girl,” distinguished throughout
by the perfect English accent of the per-
formers, no matter what tongue they are
warbling in, is a poor substitute for Maud
H. alone in “The Foundling” song; but
wherever Mr. Kooley uprears that strange ginger
poll a deep sadness falls on the show, and you lose
sight of the “ pond re de riz and little touch of
rouge” aspectof the “Shop Girl,’’and fall to think-
ing drearily that the Legislature really ouyhl to
make a rule to let the poor things sit down in work
hours. Apropos of the gigantic Mr. Monkhouse—
his taste for glittering jewels in private life is
quite Masonic and reminisceucy of the lady with
rings on her fingers and bells on her toes. One of
his chief ornaments is a diamond watch-chain,
which suggests (in the evening) that the elephan-
tine funny man has an electric railroad across the
frontiers of his person. Apropos of the Gee Gees,
I hear, on the very best authority—the manager’s
—that the co. is only to appear in Melbourne
and Sydney, and anxious enquirers from the other
Australasian centres are hereby informed that it’s
no use saving up their pocket-money for a show
that will never come. After Melbourne and
Sydney are squeezed dry the triumphant co.
either goes to Japan or straight back to England.
Sydney Criterion is the prettiest theatre, and
the best adapted for comedy, in Sydney—though
the performers do seem to rather loom over you
after the longer perspective of the larger play-
houses. There was only one fault in front on
Saturday night, and that was that the electric
points were kept full-cock when the curtain was
up. Although this sort of thing is very gratifying
to the woman with diamonds on, it detracts from
the brilliancy of the stage-picture. Quite the
feature of the Elton revival of “The Guv’nor”
was the orchestral music, under David Cope, who
received an encore for the march-past before the
last act. Mr. Cope’s interpolation in the overture
of what used to be “ Elton’s music ” in the “ Old
Guard,” in the days when Mr. E. was funny-man-
in-chief to the Firm, was a master-stroke, and
quite warmed the house for the star.
“ The Guv’nor” was so picturesquely put on
that it didn’t matter a row of pins how the ladies
dressed—the scenery always went one better.
Harrie Ireland, of the Bernhardt locks, suggested
sackcloth and ashes in the first act; but her other
gown of black silk with a Queen Anne horse—no,
1 mean a collar—of black satin fastened with a
huge paste buckle was exceedingly emotional—
only rather more suggestive of Mary Queen of
Scots in a tumbril than the frisky young spouse of
an elderly comedy-husband. Pretty Madge Cor-
coran wore a cheerful pink-and-white peppermint-
lolly sort of frock in the first act and a maize
gown in the last, while Blanche Carlyle’s cham-
pion effort was a well-fitting, drab-colored turn-
out in which nobody could help missing her in a
dust-storm. A stage debutante, so far as I am
concerned, was Miss Josie Kelso, who played the
chambermaid in natty cap and apron. Miss
Kelso is a very plump mummeress and good-look-
ing to boot, which is probably the reason why she
never-turns her back on the audience.
Apropos of the Governor—l mean the rea*
Governor Hampden—the happiest augury up to
date is that the Tocumwal (N.S.W.) Jockey Club
has already named a racehorse after him. Thus
his approaching Ex. is metaphorically taken to the
bosom of Tocumwal, which may be the key to the
vice-regal position, for all you know. I haven’t
heard of any iS.A. racehorse being christened
“ Buxton,” yet—though the name seems peculiarly
appropriate for some wild-eyed, rat-tailed neddy
with a hump in its back, don’t you think ? Gov.
Buxton has been farewelled in London, I read,
and it has been ponderously remarked that Sir
Fowell’s administrative capacity, and his loyalty,
“ would tend to solidify the connection of the
colonies with the mother country.” Tough Fowl
evidently intends to govern everybody’s head off.
“Solidify the connection,” too, is depressing
language. It sounds as if a state plumber were
being exported from ’Ome.
But this is the sort of neat-and-tasty thing
which really does more towards another strand in
those silken bonds, and encourages the deeper dye
in the crimson thread of kinship, than all the
“administrative” Governors in a bunch. It
comes from Maori land, and is to the brief effect
that the Princess of Wales has ordered two dress-
lengths of Kaiapoi tweed —Kaiapoi being the
place where they make the loveliest and cheapest
all-wool rugs I have ever seen. That, I repeat, is
the sort of invidious overt act which makes every
tweed-faker a most loyal person. When the Royal
Family import all their cabbages from Victoria—
their oranges from N.S.W.-, their bananas from
Bananaland, and their chaplains from Adelaide—
the Democratic orator will find his occupation
gone.
Apropos of locally-manufactured dress-stuffs, a
very interesting article on “Dangerous Dress
Materials ” appeared in a Sydney daily, the other
day, setting forth the peril that lies hidden in the
folds of the flannelette wrapper, “ this style only
four-and-elevenpence-three-farthings,” which so
many women wear o’ mornings when they’re coax-
ing the fire to light with kerosene. “Few people
have any conception of the readiness with which
this substance will ignite,” says the article referred
to, owing to the “fluffy or feathery nap of its sur-
face.” This, it appears, blazes like dry chips at
the least encouragement, and “ is so combustible
as to be almost explosive.” Quite a nice Xmas
present of drapery for your mother-in-law, evi-
dently. The more cottony the fabric the more
danger of its igniting. Altogether, anybody who
in the land of wool makes flannelette after this
notice ought to be found guilty of arson in the
first degree.
University Dramatic Society is billed to give a
performance of Sheridan’s famous old comedy,
“The Rivals,” at Sydney Royal Standard
Theatre, on the 21st inst. Meanwhile, where are
“The Idlers ” with their promise of “going it”
early in August ?
Everybody will be glad to hear that George
Rignold is to be tendered a complimentary benefit
by the citizens of Sydney who stayed away most
faithfully from the show, and j’et rush to shower
rose-leaves over the entrepeneur when he at last
decides to up-kellick, as Theodore Macclesfield
would say, and sail away ’Ome, leaving a good
deal of second-hand limelight behind him. The
“ ben,” promises to be a brilliant one, and Mr.
Town Clerk Daniels and Mr, City Surveyor
Richards are hon. secs, to what I hope will be a
big thing financially.
My Melbourne correspondent: Between us, the
conversazione given by the W. J. Clarkes at Clive-
den was not a success. Both the members of the
Salon and the members of VAlliance Francaise
were invited ; and, though the Salcnites lay claim
on all the local “culchaw,” few (if any)
of them are regarded as “society” folk.
On the other hand, the Alliance people
may not be intellectual, or know anything
whatever of parley-voos, but they are smart.
Consequently, the two “ pushes ” don’t blend, so
all the evening the Salonites wished they were as
“smart ” as the Alliance and the Alliance wished
that it knew as much French as the Salon, and
there was no health in the affair. Besides, what
■on earth is the good of spending much money on
a new gown and tricking oneself out in gauds and
■otherwise undergoing torture when there is not a
single man to behold one ? The few men present
were not single; they were mostly greybeards,
and weren’t permitted to behold anything but
their own large wives, who clung to them fiercely
all the evening.
The musical programme was excellent, nearly
all the singers being professionals. Miss Maggie
Stirling, who might pass for a handsome copy of
the Countess of Hopetoun, is about the best true
mezzo-soprano Melb. possesses; Miss Regina
Nagel, Mine. Steinhauer’s latest discovery, has a
most promising voice, with about twice the power
of Ada Crossley’s, and a timbre unlike anyone
else’s; Miss Laura Fisher, a tall and stately
young Maori lander, another fine cdtatralto, sang
charmingly. The supper was as good as the
music,’ and on a still more lavish scale.
Mr. Purvea’ lecture to the law-students, legal
fraternity, and friends, received with uproarious
approval at the time, has since encountered much
hostile criticism, on the ground of its alleged
“coarseness.” Knowing ones say that the audi-
ence went home in so high a state of chuckle that
their womankind never rested till they had
wormed out all the Q.C.’s spiciest stories, only to
ruffle their feathers as soon as their curiosity was
satisfied, and set up a shrill, infectious cackle of
disgust. Certainly, the lecturer’s reminiscences
of Bench and Bar were gay enough—so much so,
indeed, that even the diluted, second-hand version
pune as a shock to the mammas of law-students.
These good ladies, ’tis said, have been doleful
ever since, lamenting the “awful temptations,”
unsuspected till now, awaiting their “poor, dear
boys.”
An Australienne in England : “I spent a day
with Mrs. Haweis at her home, Queen’s House,
Chelsea,- where Dante Gabriel Rossetti used to
live. You may imagine what a joyful thing the
drawing-room is—panelled with unpolished oak,
the celling of gold with a dull cinnamon band all
round the frieze. On an exquisite stained-glass
window languishes one of Rossetti’s damosels.
The room is full of books, pictures and statues,
&c. No trivialities. They are quite ‘ out ’in
smart drawing-rooms, so please burn bulrushes,
fans, photos., Jap. figures and all ‘sic havers ’ (as
the Scotch call them).
“ I met Mrs. Mannington Caffyn, whom success
has in no way spoilt. She was moaning about the
expensiyeness of living in London. Australia is
much cheaper, she assures me, now that house--
rent is down.
“There is an affair on at the Col. Institute to
which I am bidden, but I won’t go. Too slow—
everything given in that pile is deadly save for
the orchestra. There is always splendid music
there. I heard Dan Godfrey’s band play ‘ Marche
Lorraine,’ at the Institute. If you should by
chance hear of its being played within 100 miles,
go to hear it or you will be sorry. It has in it
‘ Just look at my Sabots’ (evidently an old French
air), wi(;h the acoent different from the song.”
I am told that a “swagger” (Melb.) society
girl who started costume-building a year or two
back is doing such a roaring business that her
head woman is getting .£3OO a year, and she keeps
about 40 girls employed all through the season.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.

Extract from a letter by one of the
massacred missionaries: “The head catechist of
the district, Lung Sing Mi, is such a devoted,
simple-hearted Christian of many years standing.
I would ask you to remember him in your prayers.
The Lord has seen well to deal with him in what
one might think a strange way, in taking from
hjm one by one all his children except one little
girl.” Perhaps the Lord forgot to remind Lung
Sing Mi that his drainage was unsatisfactory.
The action against Huddart, Parker and
Co. by Mrs. Kilpatrick, widow of an engineer
who went down with the Alert, promises to be an
awful satire on trial by jury, Mrs. Kilpatrick in
the first instance got £6OO damages from a Melb.
jury. This verdict was set aside on appeal to the
Full Court. The widow is now struggling to raise
means to start afresh, and she applied last week
for a postponement of the new trial until next
sessions. Her application was granted, although
Huddart, Parkers counsel made out that any
postponement would be unnecessary cruelty, inas-
much as Mrs. Kilpatrick can’t possibly succeed,
after the Full Court finding, and ought to be
wiped out without more ado. The case is well
worth watching. If Mrs. Kilpatrick couldn’t get
damages from the court in which she won her
case, what was the use of trying it, anyway? And
if she can't win another case, after the Full Court’s
decision, why is the unfortunate woman permitted
to wear out her body and soul in further legal
proceedings? The particular Judge who con-
sidered the matter last week thought it was pos-
sible that further evidence might be obtained. If
that learned man can suggest any kind of evidence
capable of getting over the law laid down by the
Full Court (and which the same tribunal would
laydown again if a second jury awarded damages
to the plaintiff) The Bulletin will buy him a
new wig.
F. : Yic. general municipal-elections take
place on 22nd Aug. next, when the ratepayers will
have a chance of saying a lot of things to candi-
dates. The sleek and oily person who downs the
minimum wage and anti-subletting principles
every year will come forward with an oleaginous
smile to indicate that he has done faithfully and
well for the workers of his constituency in the
past, and will do so some more if returned. Then
a seedy Socialist at the back of the hall will ask,
in a loud voice, if the candidate has not ground
the faces of the poor, and sweated the helpless.
Two large policemen will thereupon run in the
seedy Socialist on a charge of blasphemy, and a
motion of confidence in the candidate will be
carried with acclamation.
Thanks chiefly to the exertions of mem-
ber Pratt, Yic. Legislative Council rejected the
flogging clause proposed by Cooke, M.L.C.,
as an amendment to the Gaols Act. From
a return it appeared that prison-visiting jus-
tices already had power fo award terms of im-
prisonment extending sometimes to 18 months,
with plentiful doses of solitary confinement. It
was generally agreed that this power is excessive,
it being, as regards “solitary,” beyond that ever
exercised by Supreme Court Judges—not one of
whom, said Solicitor-General Cuthbert, had ever
been known to give more than a fortnight’s soli-
tary, while the prison justices frequently awarded
a month.

The Cockney Duchess who writes the

Buxton accentuates previous impressions of that

Dr. Jefferis and Charles Bradlaugh, and one

with the subject’s hand reverently grasping it.
History repeats itself. An old colonist
states that during the excitement attendant on
the first election contest under constitutional
govt, in S.A., George Kingston, father of the
present Premier, thrashed Sparks, senior, an
aggressive Yankee, for dragging the Union Jack
in a Hindley-street gutter. That was early in
1857.
Novelist J. M. Barrie squawks a congratu-
latory poem in London Sketch re Walter Besant’a
title. Barrie makes “ the living present” rhyme
with “ Besant,” yet the latter calls himself B e-zant,

word. His sister-in-law calls herself Mrs, Bess-
ant —but even that does not rhyme with “ pre-
sent. ”

Dr. J. E. Neild and Dr. James Jamieson

Jamieson has a magnificent lot of “first editions.”
Both have excellent collections of Australian first

James Blanksby, of Newcastle, one of the
Reid batch of Ms.L.C., once ran a little journal
in Sydney, and had hopes of moving a large part
of the world with his lever. He had at that time
enthusiasm enough for several, and energy that
made its own work. He had also faith. “This
spread,” lie said to the writer one night, waving a
hand towards “groaning” tables for the frail out-
casts of Sydney, “will stand me in quite .£l5,
and I haven’t a penny. But it’ll come.” And,
before the writer left, a note came to hand from a
rich man (Kbenezer Vickery), stating, “ What-
ever the expense of this night’s entertainment is,
charge it to me,”
“ The testimonial
to ‘ Charlie ’ Rawson

The Bulletin's Lon-
don correspondent by
the mail before last),
“which will take the
form of a piece of plate
and a good-sized
cheque, is to be pre-
sented at the Queens-
land dinner this week.
Thanks to O.R.’s work
and popularity these
annual dinners are the
most successful gather-
ings of the year. How
is it, by the way, that
the old hands from the
other Australias never
try anything of the
kind ? Ranny Want
toiled hard to work up
an annual N.S.W. din-
ner, but failed.” The
answer is easy. A
strong leaven of the
Bananalanders resident
in London were, in days
gone by, comrades in
the bush and on new
gold-fields, the homes
of true camaraderie,
whereas the other Lon-
don - Australians were
mostly born in frock-
coats and nail-keg hats,
and are just as much
cockneys as if they had
never seen a billy boil-
ing.
The real reason for
the Continental tour,
now in progress, of Mr.
Armytage, ex-M.L. A.
for Grant, in the Vic.
Assembly, is said to be
that the father of that
able and highly- cul-
tured young politician
discovered that he was
developing dangerous
democratic opinions,
and thought that a
wider survey of the world would bring his son
to a better frame of mind. Anyway, the contest
against such an opponent as Mr. Percy Chirnside
threatened to be an expensive undertaking, as it
is said boats might have been sailed on a sea of
beer when Mr. Chirnside was a candidate for the
electorate.
Chief Justice Madden, when sworn in,
gave his religion as “Roman Catholic;” but he
seldom attends that church. The first Sunday
after he was made Acting-Governor, he entered
the Governor’s pew at Toorak Presbyterian
Church. The old verger at once pounced on him :
“Coomoobof thot, mon, that’s for the Gov’nor
ainly.” And H.E. had to give a satisfactory ex-
planation forthwith.
One of the most persistent agitators on be-
half of the Mount Rennie boys—they are all men
now—is Father Carey, the R.O. gaol-chaplam.
Though hardly a year in his present office, he has
interested himself from the first in the matter;
and, after going carefully through all the volumi-
nous papers in the case, and, being fully seized
of the essential facts, he has made it his business, in
season and out of season, to advocate the recon,

sideration of the whole matter. He has also
gathered a mass of additional evidence and new
facts of an undoubtedly startling nature, which he
will be only too glad to lay before a properly-con-
stituted tribunal.
A. G. Taylor, the bailiff-besieged editor of
Sydney Truth, has had good training for his pro-
tracted beleaguerment. A few years back the
brilliant penman lived the life of a soldier in Vic-
toria Barracks, Sydney. Clothes supplies were
short in those days, and A.G.’s toggery had gone
without renovation for Heaven knows how long.
A big parade b, iug ordered, the lengthy one com-

mind,” he was told ; “ put on the best you’ve got,
and borrow if you can.” He did borrow. At a
sort of rehearsal-parade in the barracks, Taylor
appeared in a pair of spurs, a necktie, and a billy-
cock hat. He didn’t go on public show that day,
and, strange to relate, escaped punishment.
Lecturing recently at Adelaide Democratic
Club, Premier Kingston got stuck through not
being able to read his memoranda, which were in
his own writing. After the meeting, the Register
reporter asked him for his notes, and the Premier,
who has been quarrelling with that paper, had
delicious revenge. The only readable epistle
Kingston ever wrote was, it is averred, the lette*
he sent to Chaffey Baker containing the famous
challenge to fight a duel.
Jack Want, predominant partner in the
Reid Ministry, belongs to a school almost extinot
—the old Sydney “ cabbage tree mob.” They
were men of large stature, large ideas, large pas-
sions and large appetites ; strong, hungry, lusty,*
brainy men, who spoke, and still speak, the argot
of old Sydney. Of this type, Dibbs and Want
remain to astonish the country with a bygone
slang interspersed through debating speeches.
The son of a well-known
Maoriland politician became bank*
rupt some years ago, mainly
through backing a bill for his
father. It was not, as he after-
wards explained, his father’s failure
to pay which hurt his feelings,
but the soulless levity of the old
man. The bill was for a larg*
amount, and had been signed undei
extreme pressure. When it was
nearly due the young man began to
walk about at nights thinking
over it, and at length he called on
his progenitor and laid the matter
before him. “ Look here, father, 6 ’
he said, “the long and the short
of it is, if you don’t pay that bill
I’ll have to go insolvent. Now,
can you pay it?” “My son,”
said the patriarch, placidly;
“You’ll just have to go insol-
vent. I hope this will be a warn-
ing to you never to back bills in
the future, I thought, with all my
careful training, you would hav«
known better, but it seems that
you can only learn by painful ex-
perience. Good morning.” And
the son found himself gently
shown out, while the good old man
wend back to his books. That’*
why theold man and his son don’t
speak now.
Mr. Alex. Kennedy Beve-
ridge, P.M. at Bega, N.S. W., who
died the other day- after a long
lilness, the result of a lung being
rendered useless by a broken rib,
belonged to a well-known Scottish
family and was originally a British
cavalryman. After acting as a
Japanese army-instructor, became
to Australia and took a police
captaincy, whence lie drifted into the magistracy.
Mr. Beveridge was an ornament to the Bench,
and in all relations of life an ideal gentleman.
“In the case of two of the Melb. girls'
murdered in China, the whole cause of then
going,” writes a well-informed Bulletin cor-
respondent, “ was that they were affected almost
to hysteria by a ranting evangelist down in Mel-
bourne, The excitement was kept up by another
devil-dodger of the same type, with the result as
per cable the other day.”
Mrs. Campbell-Praed, in her novel, “Mis.
Tregaskis,’’ now meandering in the Age, speaks
of the unionist shearers “fighting for freedom of
contract.” She also describes the carriers as cart-
ing their families about with them, the wife and
children living in a tent pitched on top of the load
of wool. Residence abroad always improves one’s
insight into Australian morals and manners.
George L. Lukin (brother of Gresley
Lukin), for years police-magistrate at Gympie
and Rockhampton, and latterly at Maryborough,
purposes retiring on a pension. Friends credit
him with an intention to enter Q. Parliament.
From G.L.’s previous tussles with authority, it is
expected that in the House —if he gets there—he
will be generally “ agin ” the Government.
Mrs. Mood, who died at Parramatta last
week, had for 70 years resided there, having
arrived, when only 22 years of age, as matron of
the female convicts’ “factory.” She claimed close
relationship with Geo. IV. It would have been
to the pecuniary advantage of a Parramatta busi-
ness man had the old lady died years ago, as he
purchased her property with an annuity, and lost
about 150 per cent, (not including interest calcula-
tions) on the transaction.
Vogel as a speaker revelled in finance.
He never missed an opportunity of talking mil-
lions, and when he got into seven figures he wa*
unction and impressiveness itself. In his last
M.L. budget speech he fairly waded in millions,
and the manner in which he wound up with—
“ And the entire wealth of the colony is one-
hundred—and—twelve mill-ions,” lingering lov-
ingly over each syllable—was up to date the most
impressive sample of oratory ever heard in the
Land of the Moa.
In a recent S. A. Assembly debate, Opposi-
tion member Howe accused Kingston of dragging
Parliament down to the lowest depths of degri*-
dation, and prophesied all sorts of evil if the
House did not rise and fling off the incubus.
Kingston (loq.): “The hon. member for Glad-
stone predicts that the Ministry will sink, sink,
sink like a Japanese diver. Well, like all other
bad eggs, the hon. member will float, float, float,
and similarly age will only increase his buoyancy
and malodorousuess.”
A Melb. land magnate, who died some
five years back, when he became a “ gentleman
commissioned a popular artist to paint his por-
trait. After several sittings a flattering (profile)
likeness of Michael, minus ten years, duly arrived
at his stucco mansion. Mickey, however, refused
to pay, and was haled before the county court,
where he pleaded that the artist had painted him
with “ wan oye,” and he wasn’t going to throw
away his hard-earned cash on half a likeness.’
The court decided for plaintiff, and Mickey com-
pletely “ swore off ” artists.

Premier Reid is merely ex-Premier Parkes
—Bowdlerised and with his hair cut; emasculated
and bald ; chubby and glass-eyed. Parkes is Reid,
leonine and rampant.
The Sparks assault episode has made
Kingston’s seat for West Adelaide absolutely
safe; whereas had he been whaled, his election
path would have been stormy. This is a queer
world.
Over Premier Turner, now in the zenith
of his popularity, a dark cloud impends. The
Argus has taken to blessing him, and, to a public
man, the benison of the Argus is “ fatal as cat’s
breath to baby.”
Murray Smith, M.L.A, (Vic.) : “You can
no more make a country rich by Protection than
you can make water run uphill.” Rogers, M.L. A. :
“You can make water run uphill. I’ve seen a
Chinaman do it.”
The Bulcock circular issued by the Queens-
land National Ass. (Nelson’s pet organisation) was
entitled, “How to Purify the Rolls.” At the
bottom was inscribed the legend, “ To be detached
and destroyed.” Suggestive!
The Wise-Parkes letter, read at the Wise
banquet, Sydney, last week, was published in full
by the S.M. Herald, but wholly suppressed by
the Daily Telegraph. The letter revealed
Premier Reid as his closest political friends know
him.
Illiteracy and loyalty again. The most
unlettered man in a certain Australian Parliament
was the lately-deceased A . It was touching
to hear him talking about his respect for the
Governor and the Governess (i.e., the Governor’s
wife).
South Australia, which has just practically
abolished its militia in the interests of economy,
grows very tired of the annual payment of £lO,OOO
towards the expenses of the Australian squadron,
more especially as the ships are so seldom seen in
local waters.
A strange feature of
Vic. civil - service re-
trenchment is the hazi-
ness which many old
fogeys seem to have about
their own age. A man
on entering the service
always endeavors to
make himself as old as
possible in order to be
senior to bis mates. But
when the Act was passed
making retirement com-
pulsory at 60 years, a
good many officers found
that they had made a
mistake in stating their
ages, and instead of being
59 they were only 56.
One venerable gentle-
man, who looked at least
70, lately wanted to
amend his birthday and
make himself 43, or so,
but the tyrannical Board
wouldn’t dream of it.
“Beal prosperity,
such as will reduce the
workless thousands to
hundreds,” writes the
eternal William Mainer
(who is he?), in S.M.
Herald. The sort of
mind that can contem-
plate hundreds - of men
going about starving, in
the vain search for em-
ployment, and call it
“real prosperity,” ought
to be labelled and sent to
a psychological museum.
Of course, everyone
guesses what is meant.
Just a sufficient number
of unemployed to play
olf against labor, but
not enough to become a
source of anxiety to the
plutocracy. Enough to
jostle other working men
for bread, but not the big
number that would take
the cake.

Zeal, grand Panjandrum of Yic. Leg.
Council, opines that, “notwithstanding the de-
ficit, if our railways were let to commercial men,
I believe they would pay well.” (Applause.) No
doubt. Highway robbery is usually profitable
while it lasts.
The Vic. Executive will shortly consider
the advisableness of retaining in custody the con-
victed Abrahams brothers, who are allegedly very
ill. The spectacle of Premier Turner’s Govt,
sitting in judgment on perhaps the best lot of
paying clients its chief ever had will be a truly
edifying one.
A substantial testimonial is being raised
,for “Jim Morgan,” late M.P. for Dubbo, by his
local supporters. He got beaten at the election
mainly by Ins own poverty—and makes no secret
of the fact that he embarked in the fight with .£3
odd in his pocket.
Under the old Vic. tariff, the local
distiller paid 4s. per gallon less duty than the im-
porter, and flourished considerably. The new
tariff protects him to the extent of from Is. to 3s.
only, and'whether the distilling industry can
stand the shock is doubtful.
In 1888, Sam Griffith pointed out that the
then surplus of .£116,000 in Queensland was con-
tributed by the North, and calmly abstracted and
absorbed by the South. Things have mended
since then, say the Southerners. Here are the
“ mended ” statistics : Taxation per head—<£4 12s.
for the North, <£4 for the Centre, .£1 17s. for the
South.
“I thank God I am able to supply you
with work,” said Premier Reid to a deputation
of pipe-moulders. G. H. R. always closes with a
benediction nowadays, and The Bulletin hereby
requests him not to be an objectionable snuffler,
but to stick closely to business. It doesn’t look
well to see a fat gentleman thanking God through
an eyeglass.
Regulations to limit the proportion of im-
provers and boys to tradesmen are badly wanted
in Vic. Govt, contracts. The minimum-wage
provisions are evaded by the simple device of em-
ploying, as improvers or boys, workmen forced to
accept less than minimum wages. The latter (im-
provers or boys) are exempt from the operations

The Labor League at Junee (N.S. W.),
which gave its enthusiastic support to Arthur
Rae, the Freetrader, at the late election, has
passed a resolution demanding the retention of
the present duties on agricultural produce. Junee
is an agricultural district, and the local Free-
trader wants Protection for his own industry, as
usual. They are all built that way.
The Maoriland Referendum Bill passed its
second reading in the House of Representatives by
a two-to-one vote, despite the almost open hos-
tility of Premier Seddon. Seddon’s objection to
the Referendum is almost as violent as his objec-
tion to the idea of an elective Ministry. The
present system made him a Premier, and a system
that does that is quite good enough for the burly
ex-storekeeper from the West Coast.
When Gray, member for Prahran (Vic.),
wanted “spirits distilled in the colony for manu-
facturing hair-restorers ” placed on the free-list,
Staughton asked the chairman whether he, as a
bald-headed man, could vote on the motion. The
House roared. Then the hairless Gurr opposed
the motion on the ground that baldness was a
desirable state and should be encouraged, and
the House shrieked. Finally Zox got off the

A GREAT HERO .
(A fragment of a stump-speech on football.)
“ With harrarkers to de right ob ' im; barrackers to de left oh 'im;

Parliament, it is alleged, holds the written resig-
nation of each one of its members in safe keeping
to be forwarded to the Speaker, without consulting
either the member or his constituency, if he
should offend the majority or break away from
the fold. Does Premier Reid intend to apply a
modification of the solidarity pledge to his new
Council appointments?
The ballot is nominally secret, but it’s not
very secret on those stations where there is a poll-
ing-booth presided over by the overseer with his
jackeroo as poll-clerk. “ All the men on the
station,” writes a Bulletin correspondent, “vote
as understood beforehand. They are watched
carefully if there is any doubt about them, and if
the count doesn’t come out according to calcula-
tions ‘ the sack’ is the prescribed remedy. As
there are only a few strange voters at these places
it is easy to tell how the station votes.”
A candidate and his trusted henchman
awoke one morning at the principal hotel of
Heifer Flat, N.S. VV., and called for whisky and
milk. They were told there was plenty of whisky
but no milk, as there were no cows on the Flat.
“No cows!” said the henchman, “then tell the
inhabitants that if Mr. X. gets in he will have a
sum of money at once placed on the estimates for
the purchase of a public cow for Heifer Flat.”
He got every vote there except one, that of a man
who wanted a sum also placed on the estimates
for public whisky.
Sydney D.T., which seems to have taken
a Boodlewraith retainer, upbraids Michael Davitb
for promising to enquire into the case for Q.
separation. It urges the refreshingly naive argu-
ment that, if there was any case, Q. Parliament
would have petitioned long ago. Bless the
D.T.’s innocent little Japanesy heart! It doesn’t
know that? the Southern members in Q. Parlia-
ment form about a two-thirds majority ; that the
revenue surpluses of the Centre and North are
annually milked to makegood the chronic deficits
of the South ; and that as long as separation
means a big cash loss and no-separation a direct
cash profit, it is as hopeless to expect the Southern
majority to pass a Separation Bill as it is to expect
a usurer to petition Parliament for a bill to reduce
the rate of interest.
Says Sydney Telegraph :
Taken in the larjfe, the new N.S.W. Legislative Coun-
cillors are a severely unobjectionable lot. From every
pore they exude right-thinkingness, and the ten white
flowers of their ten blameless lives Will, on the opening of
Parliament, appear in the Council as a bouquet of fresh-
pulled politieal lilies. Many of them have been raised
from the political grave, where they lay like warriors
taking their rest, with their martial cloaks around them,
or words to that effect. Others had wandered away and
died in the political hush without anybody having missed
them until Mr. Reid stumbled over th.ir political skele-
tons. For all these it is a glorious resurrection. Another
some have nervously shied at the ballot-box, and got a
quiet leg-up while the electors were not about.
To which it may be added that every one of the
ten wears a beiltopper. Hardly one of them is in
himself “ toney ” enough to be able to dispense
with His beiltopper. Which in one act ends their
reputation as democrats —of the sort that Reid
promised to appoint, or denounced his enemies for
not appointing.

The N.S.W. Ministry
may have reckoned without
its host in its Leg. Council
appointments. Dan. O’Con-

The champion humorist
of the N.S. W. elections was
a man who stood for Denili-
quin and district in the in-
terests of general reform.
He proposed to swoop down
upon the Legislature with
a Bill for the manufacture
of a 500-mile canal to con-
nect the Murray and the
Darling, from Moama to
Wilcannia. His idea was to
work the canal at low rates,
in order to do the railways
badly, and make a splendid
profit for the enterprise by
planting mahogany trees at
brief intervals on both
sides of the waterway. The
yield of costly timber would,
by the candidate’s calcula-
tion, pay the interest on
’Enery Parkes’s national
debt, and the foliage of the
trees (after they had been
cut down and converted into
furniture) would afford
delightful shade for mariners
cruising between rivers.
This genius polled eight
votes, including three from
grateful Hindoos. He inter-
prets the Hindoo tongue,
and to this devoted trio he
unfolded his policy in a
speech that nearly turned
’em pale.

EPITAPH.
COn a certain eminent statesman lately deceasedJ.
He sought our land, a prince of roaring Rada.,
Possessed and puffed with fifty furious fads;
Deep down he dived, a Legislative whale,
And banged a myriad minnows with his tail.
In youth a Chartist bold—mature, a Tory;
In age a doggerel bard and Premier hoary ;
One t'me he waved aloft the Orange rag
And “Down with Popery ” flew upon his flag ;
One time “Freetrade” the subject of his lyre;
Anon he joined the Pure-Protection choir,
The while with juggling arts and jeering jaw
He smote a listening land with silent awe.
Avowing all he wished was Peace and Rest
He sought the battle with a furious zest;
Protesting ne’er for office did he lust.
For office fighting'fierce he bit the dust.
He fooled his simple country while he could—•
His country left him for his country’s good.

Sydney Criterion re-opened on Saturday
and looked the brightest, cleanest, healthiest and
least microbe-infested establishment in the city,
Lohr’s new company started well. “ The
Guv’nor ” is a breezy comedy with just enough of
a possible New Woman element in it to suit the
popular taste, and as the suspicion that pretty
Harne Ireland is a New Woman proves wholly
unfounded in the last act, the comedy is as respect-
able as anyone could desire. The plot is simple
enough. An elderly man has a young wife, a
next-door neighbor insists on putting his death’s-
head over the garden wall and telling him about
a strange man who is frequently seen in the
summer-house. Whereupon the husband collects
corroborative evidence from a deaf man who
thinks he is talking about something to drink,
and believes that he sees a chance of selling a
boat, and from a man with a dreadful stutter
whose statements are wholly incomprehensible;
and among them the story becomes about as
shapeless and horrifying as a dog that has been
under a tram-car. There is no moral intended,
unless it be the moral that the man next door is a
ghoul by nature, and a perjurer by habit and
education, and when his clammy skull appears
above the fence it should be hailed witli road-
metal. But Elton, as the deaf boat-builder, is a
flowing river of mirth, and his chuckle is an in-
spiration ; and his call hat, and his hopeless incon-
sequence, and the patient, doggish expression with
which he regards tlie enraged husband, and the
dreadful cordiidity with which he shakes hands
with the people who are cursing him in a loud
voice, and his untimely offers of rum hot, and his
negotiations with the man who the brick in his
speech, are alarmingly funn\.
When one comes to remember
that Hans the Boatman possibly
came to look and chuckle like
that in his old age, all the
poetry vanishes out, of Arnold’s
big-dog drama. But this is a
side issue.
• * *
Westmacott, as an athletic
young man of fortune with a
stutter, is more humorous than
he usually is. His stutter
doesn’t bear the slightest resem-
blance to the real aiticle, but it
is amusing, while the authentic
stutter is just as interesting as
a corn. Miss Maine Ireland is
a lovely and picturesque heroine,
and Frank Emery, as the wicked
old head appearing over the
fence, is a fine piece of comedy.
The rest of the co. is satisfac-
tory, with ti e i-ing e exception
oi George Inland, who has a
pa't which Brough would have
made a continuous shriek of
mirth, and who labors through
it with the airy brilliance ot a
steam dredge. Still the piece,
has vitality enough to stand
even this, and Elton’s attempts
to introduce rum and good feel-
ing into a distracted family more
than compensate for everything.
Also, a horsey young man from
Yorkshire, who is always found
. t ti \ ing moments w ith a huge
I iece of bread and in
I.is hand, deserves a passing
mention.
#* * *
Still another revival of
“The World Against Her”
eve ituated on Saturday at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney. The man gcinent accom-
panted it with an intimation to the general effect
that a wave of something or other was passing
nver the community, and it was considered advis-
able to endeavor to promote something or other
with a view to combating the affair before men-
tioned and encouraging various things which The
Bulletin can’t remember just now. But the
tendency of the advt. seemed to be that it was
necessary to give virtue a lift at this critical
moment! And with a view to doing this, Mr.
Rignold has deliberately staged a drama in which
a bad man tries to mash a beautiful and virtuous
woman, and her noble husband comes in and bangs
thingsaboutand refusestolisten toany explanation,
and gets a divorce, and throws his wife out, and
sends certain ugly-looking individuals after her,
and makes her life a misery generally. The
obvious moral, through three weepful acts, is that
only a cast-iron woman, who can stand living in a
damp cellar, and going barefoot through the snow,
can afford to live up to her principles, and anyone
whose constitution isn't copper-fastened had better
elope with the rich, bad man at once, provided be
will settlea water-tight house and aspring-mattress
upon her. Misit Maud Williamson is the heroine on
tlie present occasion, and looks very sad and pic-
turesque with her hair down ; and Mr. Scot Inglis
is the bad man who calls on her, and Mr. Plimmer
is the good man who throws her out, and Mr.
Sweehey is the kind, but coarse, man who takes
her in and gives her a baked_ tatur, and they all
help to point the moral that virtue doesn’t pay,
** * *
Further consideration of the “Shop Girl”
only confirms last Week’s impression that it is a
sketchy performance and as thin as the side view
of a New Woman. Moreover, the opinion is
gaining ground that Hooley’s desire to inspect the
ladies’ marks is not altogether respectable, and
the fact that Maud Hobson’s mark is located in
the middle of Iter back doesn’t seem so interest-
ing, after a week’s acquaintance, as it did at first.
The airy fashion in which Bradfield skims over
his part covers most of its deficiencies, but Monk-
house belongs to the hulking variety of humorist,
and when he plunges heavily through his charac-
ter, like a mail-clad knight going over a bog, the
fact that there is very little character becomes
apparent. The “ Shop Girl ” doesn’t seem likely
to develope any new humor as time goes on, and
the old humor is pretty thin, and mostly concerns
Miss Hobson’s back. The rest of it —that part
which doesn’t concern Miss Hobson’s back—is
concentrated in Fred Kaye’s legs, and when Fred
Kaye’s legs are not in evidence and Miss Hobson’s
back has dropped out of sight, there is very little
left. Monkhouse gets a “farewell matinee per-
formance ” next Wednesday.

Several more “ unrivalled artists ” have
lately joined the two Sydney variety houses.
Harry Shine lifts up a fine, well-trained voice at
theTiyoli; and Miss Ada Colley, who is vastly
superior to the ordinary variety person, lias re-
turned to the Empire, and helps to keep it out of
the desolate rut of the nigger and the Irish come-
dian. The Bulletin takes this opportunity to
remark that the nigger with his dreary yarn about
the stolen chicken, and tlie Irish comedian with
his wailful song about tlie Bridget he left behind
him, ought to be about extinct by this time.

A movement is on foot to give Mr. Rig-
nold a large and enthusiastic benefit before he
leaves for England. If only for the sake of the
scenery which he has placed before the public he
deserves the largest thing of the kind which can
be put together.

The juvenile variety troupes that ape their
elders around the Melb. suburbs are undesirable
things in all respects. The best of them gives a
sickening show at the prices—3d. and 6d. There’s
no money in it for the performers or their parents.

look in. Last, but not least, there’s the manager
who takes the money, and who seems to live
pretty comfortably over the business. The chil-
dren can’t get much out of it, beyond a bad train-
ing. Two of the girls in one of these troupes
have voices that could be made valuable if they
were captured by some competent teacher, and
taken out of harm’s way immediately. At pre-
sent they seem to be educating themselves in the
worst form of music-hall twang, and will soon get
beyond redemption.

“The Importance of Being Earnest,”
which was staged at Melbourne Princess’s on
Saturday, suggests that Oscar Wilde’s characters
grew brighter and lost some of their high-toned
boredom as the shadow of the imminent gaol
began to fall upon their author. Some of them
are reasonably young, whereas in “ Lady Winder-
mere ”■ they were all very old and haggard in their
minds, and several of them have a certain fresh-
))ess which was conspicuously absent in the other
crowd. None of Wilde’s new crowd of people
look real, but they probably were not intended to;
they all live in an atmosphere of high-pressure
epigram, and . the trail of an unearthly smart-
ness is over them. But none of them have an
objectionable past, and they don’t commit any
notable sins, and their brilliance is amusing and
harmless. The title seems to have been thrown
j n promiscuously, as it were, for no one is earnest,
or even pretends to be, and no one professes to
the importance of anything. Ward and
Boucicault, and the pretty Miss Beryl Faber, sup-
port the most of this pleasant butterfly drama,
which is to hold the stage until Friday,
Then there will be a spell of the “ Village Priest,”
and the season closes with another attack of
“ Mrs. Tanqueray.”

Miss Elizabeth Watson, the sister of Aus-
tralia’s lamented Henrietta, made her first appear-
ance at Melbourne Royal on Saturday, and was
accepted with enthusiasm, partly for her own
sweet sake and partly for that of Henrietta afore-
mentioned. The new drama, “Saved from the
Sea,” is not, however, a specially striking effort.
It belongs to the ordinary, bulky variety of
horror, in which the raw, red villain is pre-
dominant, and the hero is always being sent to
R a( d f° r enormous periods on no sufficient
evidence, and the simple heroine is heiress to a
stupendous fortune, and a very large and crude
conspiracy is blown up at last on the unsupported
evidence of somebody whose testimony is obviously
wort hless. Also the two villains bungle as dread-
fully as usual. Which is saying a good deal, for
average melodramaHe viHam emit walk

relies mostly on Walter Baker and the attractive
Mias Watson, though several dozen other charac-
ters get in each other’s way a good deal and
block the view of some really line scenery.

The London newspaper men, if they had read “ Dorian
Gray,” were magnanimous in their notices of Oscar
Wilde’s plays. Dorian speaks of a little Hebrew manager
who complained "that all the dramatic critics were in a
conspiracy against him, and that they were all to he
bought.” To which Dorian’s evil genius replies—“ I
believe he was quite right theie. But, on the other hand,
most of them are not at all expensive.”
Melb. audiences have a keen scent for local allusions.
An enthusiastic “push” from Collingwood way strayed
into the Royal, the other night. When Baker, in the
third act of "A Sailor’s Knot,” delivered Ids gallery
speech about the glory “of Nelson and Collingwood,” the
“ push ” applauded vigorously. If Bland can work in a
reference to Geelong in his next piece its success is
assured.
At the Polygorama entertainment given in Melb. Town
Hall, views of the South Seas were being thrown on the
screen. Seven pictures were displayed at a time, and a
rev. lecturer orated on each in turn. Suddenly a slide
was shown which would have been a good illustration for
the suggested part, of Louis Becke’s “A Ponapea.n Con-
venanoe." The audience laughed—they could because it
was dark and the lecturer said he would not dwell too
long on the scenes as time was pressing, and the lantern
men changed the pictures.
The rivalry between Melb. suburban dramatic com-
panies led to an amusing duel I lie other day between tw o
bill-stickers. It was caused by the usual barnstormer
practice of pasting- over the hills of the rival show. The
men slashed at each other with their brushes; one
emptied his bucket over the other, and then they closed
and fell. No one came near enough to separate them,
because paste was flying in all directions, like mud off a
wheel, but the men left, off when they were tired, and got
up and made for the nearest horse-trough to clean them-
selves. Had the suit been hot tlie pair would have stuck
together;. ,
If ever Henry Irving comes to Australia, writes a cor-
respondent, it will he.uuder the auspices of the B. and B.

It was counted as an ill omen for Oscar Wilde’s play at
Melb. Princess’ that the acting-vice-regal Madden had
“commanded” the first performance. “The Thorough-

Near Condobolin, N.S. W., a selector

Southern Cross (W.A.), the place where
Bailey Deeming was captured, has some trouble
on with its Mayor over a cablegram of grovel to
the Queen. The Mayor, who basks under a short
name and four large initials, requested the Council
to settle a bill of <£3 Os. 6d. for “ a cable message
to Her Majesty congratulating her on the 58th
anniversary of her accession.” The councillors
objected, and, when last heard from, the Mayor
was plunging violently about the municipal pre-
mises and using the sort of language which the
average Mayor does use when requested to pay for
his own grovel. Somehow the genuine groveller
always wants someone else to pay for his congra-
tulatory cablegram. If Southern Cross is like its
Mayor the hairy-eared Deeming did well tc out
of that town.
Victoria got to the end of its financial year
with a deficiency of .£114,000, which was about
the amount exp -cted, and by far the best result
achieved since Gillies’ time. The accounts would
have squared if the Fat Men of the Council had
passed the Land Tax Bill, but they didn’t, and,
as there is no means of putting effectual pressure
upon them, Premier Turner accepts the inevitable
for the present. Next year £’250,000 worth of
Shiels’ Treasury bills fall due, and as Turner lias
to liquidate them and also to prevent a renewal of
the present shortage, and has no extra revenue in
view at present, he has manfully hacked another
.£400,000, or so, off the expenditure, and, by this
means, lie hopes to make ends meet. If his esti-
mates come out right, the accumulated deficit will
be reduced by a quarter of a million. Meanwhile,
the Council has gained very little by its rejection
of the proposed new Land-tax ; the only result
has been a heavy reduction in the municipal
subsidy, which means increased taxation for local
government purposes. The more advanced party
in Victoria is beginning to complain that Turner
is a man without democratic instincts, but, at all
events, for an uphill fight with an empty Treasury
he is the most promising person Australia has
produced for a good many years.
Last week, The Bulletin, in alluding to
the election ol Speaker Abbott to the presidency
of N.S.W. Art Society, remarked that “an
organisation which could not keep within its own
ranks any honor which might attach to its presi-
dentship only invited the contempt of the public.”
With reference to this, a correspondent contends
that, “ dealing with the peculiar circumstances of
the society, it cannot be held that any contempt
attaches to the majority of members through the
election of Speaker Abbott. Last year, a majority
professedly in favor of electing artists, and artists
only, to manage and judge, had an excellent
opportunity of carrying its precepts into practice
by electing as president an artist nominated for
the position; but, instead of electing him, or
nominating another artist to oppose him, they put
up an outsider, Mr. Reginald Bluxsome, not an
artist, but a Philistine, and secretary of the Water
and Sewerage Board, who beat Mr. Collingridge
by two votes.” Proceeds this writer: “The
annual smoke-nights of the Art Society were
usually Bohemian affairs ; yet the first under Mr.
Bloxsome had on the card that it was a ‘ dress ’
affair. Now, I confess I haven’t got a diess-snib
—and many other members are, no doubt, similarly
circumstanced. The Art Society, from being a
decent Bohemian organisation, was thenceforth
conducted on “dress-suit” principles, and even
some of the good, old, clever Bohemians, who
theretofore smoked tobacco and wore sac coats,
took (after they sold a picture or two) to cigars
and long coats. Seeing that tlte members pre-
ferred lone —which I myself do not despise—l am
glad to find that, this year, those who last year
supported Collingridge, endeavored to get it, by
putting up a man—an outsider, a Philistine, if
yon will—but one who occupies one of the highest
social positions in the province. I am not per-
sonally influenced by position or title, but, if they
would have an outsider, thought I, let’s give them
a first-class outsider; if they would have tone,
let’s give it them, with plenty of intellect as well.
And so I voted for the Speaker of the Legislative
Assembly in preference to Mr. Reginald Blox-
some.”

THE GOOD SLEEP OF A BAD MAN.
In a certain prison that we all have heard of lay
a convict upon his narrow iron cot. He was to be
hanged the next morning. Yet he lay there,
covered by a rough blanket, sleeping as quietly
and soundly as a tired schoolboy. Occasionally
the guard in the passage outside peered between
the bars of the cell, only to find his charge breath-
ing deeply and regularly. This man had violated
the law prohibiting murder ; yet he had not vio-
lated the physical laws governing his own body,
and nature rewarded him as if he had been the
noblest of his race.
That same night, less than a mile away, a rich
man tossed and tumbled upon his luxurious bed.
He was a good and useful member of society, yet
he could not sleep. And, worse still, this hap-
pened to him every night. Sleep—that blessing
which the Psalmist says, “God giveth his
beloved,” was practically a stranger to this man.
What ailed him? The tortures of conscience?
Want of money ? The fear of enemies ? Nothing
of the sort. Then why didn’t he sleep as well as
the murderer ? You would like to know ? Right,
let us look into the matter.
“I got no sleep at night; I would lie for hours
tossing about. In the morning I was worse tired
than when I went to bed.”
Thus writes Mrs. Eliza Mathews, of 1, North
Road, Burnt Oak, Edgware, near London, under
date of September 22nd, 1892. Just two years
before this time she lost her health. A foul taste
in the mouth, loss of appetite, and great distress
after eating were among the first things she com-
plained of. She craved food at times, and fancied
she could eat heartily, yet when the very dishes
she had asked for were set before her she turned
from them as though they were filth from the
gutter. Her skin grew sallow, her eyes yellow,
and she had a constant pain at her chest, sides,
and between her shoulders. Her bowels were
constipated, and the least exertion set her heart
thumping as if it must jump up into her mouth.
At such times it was as much as ever that she
could get her breath. She got so thin and weak
she was no good for work. She couldn’t walk out
doors without stopping to rest every few rods
almost.
The doctor did what he could for her, all any
doctor could do. At first he said lie thought her
illness was owing to the smell of the farm-yard.
This looked possible. Even the smell of violets
has made strong men turn pale and faint dead
away. Yet the doctor was wrong. If he had
been right, she would have got better when the
family left the farm at Bently Priory and went to
live at Burnt Oak. But she was not improved by
the change of air ; she grew worse and worse.
“In May, 1887,” says Mrs. Mathews, “I went
over to Chlemsford to visit my aunt, Mrs.
Troughton. She told me of the good Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup had done her when she
had indigestion and dyspepsia. She bought me a
bottle, and I began taking it. After a few doses I
felt relief, I kept on taking it, and in two months
I was strong and well as ever. My husband and
friends were astonished, yet I assured them that
Seigel’s Syrup had done it. Yours truly, (Signed)
Eliza Mathews.”
The point is plain enough. The convict slept
soundly because he was a healthy man, although
he was a wicked one. Our rich friend rolled about
all night because his nerves were unstrung by the
state of his stomach. Our correspondent was
prostrated by the same thing—indigestion and
dyspepsia. The remedy named (aired her because
it has that power. The reason remains a secret
with the roots and herbs from which it is made.
Yet so long as it drives away disease and gives us
back our health and strength, who cares for its
mystery ? Results, not arguments, are what we
all want.
“Burnt Oak House, Edgware, September, 22nd,
1892. I have known Mrs. Mathews for some
seven years, and remember her long and lingering
illness. She informs me that Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup cured her, after medical and other
means failed. Mrs. Mathews is a lady of respecta-
bility, and her word can be implicitly relied upon.
You can use this statement in any way you may
think proper. Yours truly, (Signed) T. H. House,
Grocer and General Provision Dealer, Burnt Oak
Stores, Edgware.”

Dear Bulletin, —I went to a Sydney
■doctor the other day. He gave me a prescription.
The body of it was just this : “ Mist. Rubra ” —
no more. “ You take this,” says he, “ to Quercus,
the chemist, at such-and-such a number in So-so
street.” “But I deal with Picrotoxin and Co.,”
said I, “ and as I happen to know that this is
only a ‘ tally ” prescription—* Red Mixture ’ —I
want a proper one; a menu of contents, please.”
“You go to Quercus, and that prescription will
fix you up all right. Picrotoxin and Co. put any-
thing in their mixtures, and you can’t rely on
their drugs.” “Defamation, that! doctor, if I like
to make trouble. I’ve been in the trade myself,
and know.” ... Of course I got my pre-
scription, and the doetor lost one commission on
Red Mixture out of Quercus. It’s a pretty little
game, but it’s time the public knew about it.
Every man has the right to choose his own
chemist. I could tell a few rousing yarns of
medical-commission connections and of “Mix-
tures ” that were real patents for absorbing the
surpluses from any and every cause, until the
“Winchester quarts ” had to be broken to get at
the curious insolubles gradually sedimented, layer
on layer, making thebottle useless. —Yours, Dipso.
Dear Bulletin, —Let me supplement your
last correspondent’s par. re the fortunes made by
original Broken Hill holders. The Horns were
“ somebody ” prior to buying in to the Hill—they
had a lot of money out all over the Barrier. The
Wilsons were also somebody, inasmuch as W. R.
Wilson was general-manager for the Barrier
Ranges Association, and a hard worker and
genuine speculator. To Horn and Wilson,
ably assisted by W. P. M‘Gregor, of Glen-
lyon, belongs the credit of forming the
property into a large consolidated co. But
the lion’s share of kudos in connection with
this property unquestionably belongs to George
M‘Culloch, then of Mt. Gipps. He was the
ruling genius long ere either Walter Sully or J. S.
Reid had any interest in the mine. As a matter
of fact, Reid did not come in till after the mine
was floated, and shares were .£l4 or £l5 each.
Sully certainly did own a small original interest,
but how does your correspondent arrive at the
idea that Sully and Reid were the only know-
ledgeable workers of the crowd, when neither ever
worked an hour on the mine, and the “ work-
ing ” of the float, &c., was due, as I have said, to
Wilson, Horn, M‘Gregor, Bowes Kelly, and
George M'Culloch? Yes, to George M'Culloch,
I, as an outsider who watched the rise of this
marvellous mine, assert belongs the credit of
keeping together the Proprietary in the sometimes
black and cheerless days before any co. was formed.
Your correspondent also errs when he says Charley
Rasp pegged out blocks 1 to 14. The blocks pegged
out were 10 to 10—seven in all, and they were
held by a syndicate of the employes of Mt. Gipps
station (on which the mine is situated) with G.
M‘Culloch, manager of the station, as secretary for
said syndicate. The names of the original holders
were Rasp, M‘Culloch, Urqubart, Lind, Poole,
James and Phillip Charley, and they held one-
seventh each. Owing to sales of half inter-
ests here and there, the shares were made into
fourteenths, which in turn became again divided
by sales, and so on till the co. was formed. I
don’t quite agree with your correspondent as to
the amount of kudos he gives Reid and Sully.
Certainly they did their best, but there were others
who did far more, and who assuredly did not
make their success by “stubbing their toes in the
dark.” There was a fairly long and trying
struggle before Broken Hill was an assured suc-
cess, when her poor returns were completely over-
shadowed by the brilliant, but patchy, Day Dream,
Lubra, Apollyon, Bobbie Burns, &c., &c. The
majority of the originals stuck well and deserve
what they got.—W.

“Six years ago, I liad an attack of Indiges-

several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
my customers recommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-

Cable news that Brazil felt injured by a
British annexation of Trinidad must have set the
little world of foreign-stamp collectors thinking.
The only Trinidad known to philatelists has been
quite English for many years. The ancient figure
of Britannia on the postage - stamps was sup-
planted by Queen Vic.’s head some years ago, and
the money is, in the language of stamp albums,
“like Great Britain.’’ Trinidad proper lies not
far from the Venezuelan coast, and is, in fact, a
good deal nearer to Brazil than the paltry little
island, way out in the South Atlantic, about which
they are making such a to-do. The other Trinidad
is a lone, forgotten lump of rocky ground, only
six miles in circumference, so England may as
well have it, and stamp it with V. R’s. beautiful
young head according to the custom of the country
“ Gallia,” by Menie Dowie, is a fine sample
of the fin-de-siecle novel. Gallia is a lovely New
Woman, brainy, phiianthropical, sweet-tempered,
and disposed to hug the man she loves without
asking his consent. He holds aloof from the
maiden’s strong intellectual caress, but lacks the
manliness to admit that his coolness is mere pru-
dence, forced upon him by heart-disease. This
leaks out in the last chapter, after Gallia has
entered upon the task of trying to love another.
Gallia has liberal views on marriage and
maternity. A woman, she expvins to her
girl friends, may be an ideal wi\ c e, although
her constitution doesn’t justify experiments
in the way of offspring. “ What, then, would
be the reasonable tiling to yo ? Sacrifice
the poor woman for the sako of a weakly
baby ? ” Gallia answers her own conundrum
on the spot. “No, of course not, but gee in a
mother ! She would he a splendid, healthy
accredited woman, and probably physically very
attractive. The man’s sentiment, if lie had any,
would be greatly in her favor. He would have
been able to indulge his very highest feeling in
the choice of his wife. It would make enormously
in favor of morality.” This is a novel for hus-
bands to read and dream over, bet ore the winter
fire, when their lawful spouses have retired to
rest. Married ladies, as a rule,.will not support
the notion for “getting in a mother.” Menie
Dowie writes for men. Her story, readable from
cover to cover, is dedicated to her own husband.
She sympathises with the male person’s sense of
duty to amorous impulse, and rounds off her
reflections with a mock Osoaric epigram. Thus—
“ Nature has no regard for the fitness of
things, and Life arranges the most tasteless
contrasts. For instance, it was far from
agreeable of them both to make Gallia attract
Mark with the light lit by Essex’s kisses,
and it was equally outr6 in them to send Mark to
the arms of his mistress with his head filled with
the thoughts of another woman. But none of the
persons concerned were to blame for these con-
tingencies. Life and Nature were alone respon-
sible, and can only be excused on the ground that
neither is well-bred.” The mistress whose arms
Mark was sent to is a confiding little French girl.
She falls ill (under circumstances which The Bul-
letin would blush to understand), and Mark finds
poor Oara one day groaning upon the couch, in
charge of a charwoman. The charwoman thinks
he ought to know something about the case, but
he doesn’t. He is astonished to hear that the
poor girl was taken ill whilst dancing. “ A
sharp look from the faded eye of Mrs. Miles
was lost upon him.” He bent over Cara to
enquire why she had danced so much. Cara said “I
was frightened, and so I thought I would dance
and dance.” He shook his head vaguely. “ Bein’
no stairs to come up and down,” said Mrs. Miles,
in a furtive undertone” . . . Somehow there
is an air of reality about “Gallia.” It is con-
sistently written. One hopes that the heroine will
be happy with her husband, despite her passion
for the icicle with the diseased heart. She pro-
mises him that “my hands and arms will know
perfectly how to clasp you,” although she has no
sentiment worth mentioning. “Love-making,”
says Gallia, “is a trick of heredity. Hands, arms,
and lips are born with the cunning of it.” Where-
upon “Mark shivered with sudden passion.” An
entertaining work, with no unpleasant char-
acters in the plot, and very little plot that doesn’t
shiver with passion.
All around the always beautiful Albany
Pass, and the islands of that extreme portion of
North Queensland, the cocoanut trees (planted by
Govt.) now grow in profusion, and make an ideal
tropical picture of what was even formerly one of
the loveliest show places of the eastern coast of
the continent.

The N.S.W. Opposition—Who Shall
Lead It?
Editor Bulletin, — The king is dead! Yester-
day George Dibbs was leader of the N.S.W.
Protectionist party —to-day, none so poor lo do
him reverence. Even the meanest mid lowest
specimen of roaddom and bridgedom declines to
sink his insignificance to make room for a noble
ruin—a discredited leader, or inisleader, of men.
George Dibbs is a man who casually wandered
into politics. His training, his temperament,
his mental bias, his vices, his very virtues, all
unfitted him for the political sphere. Yet, in a
mistaken moment, lie became a politician. In
a country like N.S. Wales any man is a possible
leader. In tlie country which endured—nay,
worshipped—the able trickster Parkes, sup-
ported the pauderer Martin, tolerated that
mixture of humbug and self-seeking Stuart,
and loved that strange combination of slang,
snuffle and blasphemy, Jack Robertson, it was
not a surprise when, one morning, George Dibbs
walked accidentally into the room of a newly-
fledged Protectionist parly, and, catching the
words “ We want a leader ! ” offered his alleged
services, and was accepted.
» * •
Who can forget the night when he delivered
his first speeeli as a convert from Freetrade in
Sydney Masonic Hall ? A crowded audience,
a crowded platform, enthusiasm fore and aft.
Ou the platform uany a good man who had
fought the battle of Protection against crusted
tradition, inborn stupidity, religious cant, and
racial prejudice, sat there that night knowing
not that a buccaneer was being given command
of the ship, and that many a man would go
overboard aud many a shipwreck threaten
before the new captain could be dislodged. The
history of Protection since then lias been but
a record of dwindling disaster. The common-
est political tyro could never have committed
the mistakes which are placed lo the record
of this big-hearted bungler.. Every step lias
been marked by the most malicious stupidity,
the most malign contempt for the interests of
a great parly —for even the common safety of
its members. The instinct of self-preservation
is common to the lowest, as well as the highest
of the animal kingdom. So in politics. The
soaring eagle of politics, even in his loftiest
flight, knows the right time to flutter down-
wards. But this big, manly man, this fine
fibre of a gentleman, knew no more about the
instinct of political self-preservation than a
sheep does. Seeking lo represent a great
majority of the people, he always insulted the
masses. Scorning to be the tool of a section of
tlie community, he always placated tlie classes.
Always ou the look-out for political chances,
be always missed them. Unconvinced, uncon-
cerned, unable to distinguish Freetrade from
Protection, indifferent when shown the diver-
gence, he floundered along through the shifting
quicksands of politics, sinking lower and lower
until escape was impossible,, and with oppor-
tunities neglected, with chances thrown away,
a party decimated by his callous, wilful or
stupid acts, he is shut out of political life at a
moment most inopportune for himself, but, we
may hope, most opportune for his party.
* m *
What was the secret of his decline and fall ?
For one thing, as lias been said, bis tempera-
ment. Shallow, unread, ignorant of literature,
especially iguoranl of political economy, he in-
troduced into politics a Micawber-like fatalism,
an unready groping for something tangible in
the fluctuations of an unconvinced mind.
Brave, undoubtedly ; manly and generous, un-
questionably ; kindly aud attractive in bis per-
sonality, he would have won all hearts had he
only had a very small percentage of sincere
political conviction to base his personal quali-
ties upon. Again, never in tlie whole history
of politics has a man been cursed with such a
run of political ill-luck as George Dihbs.
All the financial disasters, all tlie deficits,
all the brutal and unjustifiable hangings, all the
unemployed crises, have managed to bring
themselves under notice in connection with his
name. Dickens knew the value of a name to
create a mental bias in a reader. It was a
lucky thought when he invented the name of
Squeers for Yorkshire schoolmasters as they
were then. Aud so tlie monosyllable Dibbs has
always had a fatal significance attached to it in
New South Wales, sufficient to make the owner
and any party he led stagger under it. He
stopped the sale of public estate. Yet he is
cursed as the creator of the “Dibbs deficit.”
He was opposed to the introduction of Chinese,
yet he has been called Chinaman Dibbs. He
feeds tlie hungry, clothes tlie naked and never
turns a deaf ear to a tale of distress. Yet he is
accused of having said that the working men
should “ eat grass.” What a fatality of rapidly
rolling circumstances have followed in his un-
happy footsteps—until the fortunes of his party
may be said to depend upon his utter extinction
as its leader aud his entire disassociatiou from
its policy. #
Long live the king ! But who shall he be ?
Lyne? Well, he has long hankered for the
sceptre of authority. A blatant man, with a
pugnacious demeanour, a crusted Conservatism,
a selfishness which one could cut with a knife, a
bullying habit; per contra, a fair administra-
tive capacity, and a reputation for courage and
unswerving consistency aud for sticking to those
who stick to him. Added to this, a small know-
ledge of procedure, no fertility of resource, poor
debating power, no knowledge of constitutional
law, and you exhaust the man. Next—Joint
See! No administrative capacity, a long-
winded flatulence in debate, a habit of repeti-
tion, a costermonger’s knowledge of figures, a
constant habit of declaring that he is “ animated
bv the very best of intentions ” —a substance we
.bear Hell is,paved with. Shall he assume the
-.man tie of Dibbs? O’Sullivan, stand forth ! Shifty,
mustable as water, adroit; no debating power, but
;a certain force and finesse which occasionally
tells. Well, this man is preferable to tlie weak
and apologetic. See, or tlie headstrong and
bulky, belligerent Lyne. Next —Crick. Well,
here's a leader, at any rate. A born leader is a
man who knows ids own road, aud never needs,
to follow. Crick is all that, and something
more. He lias the highest debating power and
readiness-rough, Lis true, but great for all
that. Courage is his. As a constitutional
authority he ranks above the Speaker. When
he debates a constitutional point or a point of
order, he settles the question clearly and de-
finitely. The wordy Barton could not out-
argue him. Neither could the silly, gabbling
Reid, or the utterly insignificant Gould, who
rushes in always where angels fear to tread.
Against Crick in the full height of his intellec-
tual power, with his wild oats nearly sown,
stands the Crick that was, with a load of pre-
judice to carry, with a cross of boyish foolish-
ness to hear. The past rises up against him.
Then, again, the unfortunate combination of
letters constituting liis name—Crick—nearly as
had as Dihbs or Squeers. And yet, in the
kingdom of the politically blind, he stands alone
a one-eyed king.
* » *
These are the present visible alternatives
from Dihbs in the leadership of the Pro-
tectionist party. Away into the night of
oblivion goes the titled Republican, the
soft-hearted, Executive hanger, the attrac-
tive personality of political repulsiveness.
Who shall succeed him ? May his rest he long
and peaceful, for his party shall build its
success upon the negative service he does by
his absence ! The longer his absence, the better
for his parly, though the kindly, headstrong,
blundering man of reality is nothing like tlie
creature which has been set up in the daily
press and labelled Dibbs —saddled with all the
political delinquencies of the last 15 years,
loaded with the crimes which others have com-
mitted, held responsible for disasters which
others have brought about, attributed with
sentiments utterly foreign to the man and Ids
nature. And who shall succeed him ? The
king is dead, long live the king—but which !
Jacques.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
The proposal that the next Australian team
should play a special match to “benefit” Hie veteran
Caffyn is not likely lo awaken much public sympathy.
That concentres itself upon the stars; devotes its many
thousand shillings, for instance, to \V. G. Grace ; but, as for
poor old Caffyn, who taught Ausiraliansa great deal of their
cricket— well, let him keep on earning his three-ha’pence
a shave in his present obscurity.

Dear Bulletin, —You said last week that “the
omission of Giffen from Hie next Australian Eleven would,
no doubt, mean Hie withdrawal of Hie w hole 8. A. brigade,
which would never do.” The whole S.A. brigade except
Giffen would secretly chuckle were Giffen left out. The
whole S.A. brigade remembers how Giffen forced brother
Walter into l he last team in preference to several better
S.A. men. When a cricketer has slaved 12 years or so for
the purpose of realising bis darling ambition, (bat grand
English trip, lie won’t gladly forego bis present chance
because Giffen ousted him before. There are two or three
of Hie S.A. brigade who think that an English trip would
make them more serviceable to Australia than even Giffen
is. There are several S.A. men and many Vies, and
Sydneyites who say that Giffen lost Hie past season’s first,
and last test-matches. Giffen’s conceit and temper have
made him the most unpopular cricketer in Australia, and
the whole S.A. brigade would delight in seeing the great
man brought to reason. —Key.
* v v «.
E l. Bulletin, —The reason why George Giffen
should not captain Hie next Australian eleven is that
Giffen, when captain, acts as if Giffen were Hie whole
eleven. For instance, Capt. Giffen starts with Hie best
bowler (t.e., Giffen); and if the best bowler doesn’t come
off lie toils <iii the next best, w ho is Giffen ; ami if this
second-best, bowler doesn’t succeed, he puts on the best
change bowler, viz., Giffen; and if this best change
bowler gets p st‘ il, he tries l he whole eleven one after the
other, w hich is Giffen ; and he, too, failing, not lung is left
but for the captain lo put himself on, who is Giffen. This
being ineffectual, Giffen goes on himself lo keep the runs
down, and by this time Hie opposing team has scored
neaily 1000 and won Hie match. I have in my mind’s-
eye two men who could most adequately fill the post, if
only Hie one could be relied upon lo do the right thing at
Hie proper time, and if Hie other would keep off the cursed
drink. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, either would
lie belter than Hie always sober and too energetic Giffen,
for Hie first could be bullied into taking advice from Hie
rest of tlie team, and the second could never get so drunk
as to believe himself eleven men.—Sam.

The W. G. Grace testimonial committee plead
that “a ‘ testimonial’ would be acceptable lo Hie cham-
pion, as it is an open secret that his life-long devotion to
the interests of our national game has necessarily inter-
fered with Ins practice as a medical man.” Grace lias
us.'d his medical diploma for all it was worth, extracting
larger professional fees through it as an amateur cricketer
than any professional cricketer everobtained, and making
in one y ear’s Australian tour ±3OOO, which as a doctor lie
would probably have taken ten favorable years to earn.

The connection between sculling and cycling—
tlie reason why crack scullers generally prove good
cyclists—is that Hie exercises are practically iden-
tical. This is proved by the snap-shot photos, of
champion Zimmerman in the current Scniu.NERS,
where this abnormal cyclist is shown in the nude
on ids machine from a rear aspect. Tlie first pic-
ture shows him in repose, nut in the second—“ scorch-

The amateur athletic associations of Sydney
define an amateur as “ one w ho lias never competed for a
money prize, slaked bet, or declared wager, or who lias
not knowingly competed with or against a professional
for a prize of any description, or for public -exhibition, or
who has never taught, pursued, or assisted in Hie prac-
tice of any athletic exercise as a means of livelihood or
for pecuniary gain.” Few Australian amateurs reach
this lily-white standard. H fenders of the cash or bogus
amateur argue that, under the ideal am.at nr system, the
amateurs arranged wins a id backed their men accord-
ingly, and were altogether so Impel, ssly corrupt that the
introduction of tin* filthy -lucre sy stem i < ally endm ed to
comparative straightness. One result, of the above defini-
tion is to relegate the “amateur ” ciickelers of the Aus-

T 1 m N.S.W. League of Wheelmen’s road-race
brought 32 cyclists to the post to graft 19 miles and back
over the hard and Lilly' road between Parramatta and
Penrith. Those sleepy villages turned out in force for
the event; close upon 200 cyclists were upon the road
pacing and encouraging their fancies. Willis, tire
Head Bird, was paced by many admirers, including a
racehorse. But lie fell, like many others, with a sad fall.
Of those wdio capsized, II rris, it is said, is still in tied.
The cracks, Megson end L wis, didn’t race; at least,
Megson did for three miles and then gave up because bis
tire had punctured ; Lew is couldn't race because of an
affliction which has immortalised Job. Buck, who is 45
years old, rode three machines altogether, the first punc-
turing and the second breaking. Five miles from home
Buck led M’Coombe, the second man, by five minutes,
but when only a mile remained M’Coombe and a big bill
came together and the exhausted Buck was beaten.
Thenceforth M'Coombe ran merrily on and won by lialf-a-
mile. Buck, encouraged l>y six friends, struggled on,
getting second place, lint the severe ordeal prostrated him
for two hours after. M’Coombe, who won on a Humber
machine, is an ex-Maorilai der and Victorian, He won in
’92 the one-mile championship of Maoriland and the five-
mile championship of Australasia. The first prize was a
new cycle.

The 8000 people, including Lieutenant-Governor
Harley, who watched Victoria play N.S.W. Rugby foot-

with the conviction that no biilliant Victorian footballer

N.S.W. players were away in Brisbane losing the match
against Queensland, but (base left behind beat ibe Vic-
torians by 25 to C. The Vies, numbered, it is said, 10 ex-
Maoiiiand Rugby men, but surely no Maoiilander ever
played Rugby in the courteous and obliging spirit the
Victorians showed. Madigan, for instance, w lien nearing
full-back M'Malion, never dropped the ball and started
dribbling it; lie held it under his arm with the zeal of a
crusader nursing a sacred relic, and he charged the full-
back with tlie fell resolve of an enraged bull. Rugby, to
be played properly, must be played either with all pluck
or no sense, and as the Vies, last Saturday played with
pluck temp red by sense their exhibition new ssarily failed
to reach the crowd’s accepted standard of Rugby foot-
ball. The return match is play ed on Saturday, 17i.fi hist.

Tiio cable about the Corbett Fitzsimmons bar

brain Fitzsimmons with a chair,'whereupon Fitzsimmons
felled Brady. Then Fitzsimmons and Corbel I fought, ai d
the ace mni says in ' ff cl that Corbett did it all himself,
getting Fitzsimmons’ In a I into chancery and punching it
severely; als', that it took three of Corbett’s ftiends lo
bold Fitzsimmons while Corbett savagely cut the laller
with a knife. The narrative goes on to explain that ulti-
mately friends interfered preventing Fitzsimmons renew-
ing the light, and that also Fitzsimmons didn’t have a
chance to renew the light because Corbett had already
fled from the room leaving Fitzsimmons victor. Then
both these lasi statements are contradicted by the asser-
tion that the police cleared Hie saloon to prevent a free

makers’ faith in Turkish baths. Dunn, of old, used to
take “a blanky good sweatin’ ’ about four tunes a

arm in a sling, or a foot that can be seen coming hall-a-

The match run last Friday at Carrington
Grounds, Sydney, between Irving Sayl 8, the daik
comedian, and the 'smart Vic. ped., Franks, tor tot,
preitv well exposed the colored gentleman s hand.
Sayles would have had a “dead bird' _ were he
not the very worst starter on earth. He 1 3 . sput up
like a pair of compasses and looked “ terrible nt,
his long, lean, bronze legs recalling Hewitts in
the latter’s prime. Hewitt was much disgusted at
his pmt6g6’s weakness as a starter. After letting rranKs
away with four yards lead the darkey buckled to and
20yds fr m home was level. Four yards further he led
by half-a-yard, and, though the compact white jumped a
dozen feet in his last effort, Sayles broke the string (in.

Moroncy’s 15th Carrington Handicap of .£l5,
run in conjunction with the Sayles-Franks match, was a
well-contested event. Denny Braithwaite (4jyds.) ga\ eas

himself the best local sprinter of the day, not barring the
Marshes. In the final, Braithwaite pnlb d off 111 the last
stride of a hopeless race, and “Potter” (9Jyds.) won by
7in. from M’Farlane (9Jyds.). Baird’s registering-machine
was proved, in this handicap, to lie a really marvellous
and unchallengeable judge. “ Potter,” the winner, is a

J.D. : The Fizzers were a famous mob of wild
horses, the progeny of a thoroughbred called the Fizz* r,
which only became extinct in or about ’74, and could be
found anywhere on the plains between Togamain—owned
by Jacky Dow—and the Murray, in earlier times. Jacky
Dow was one of the earliest and biggest squatters between
the Murrumhidgee and Murray. All Riverina men know
of the Fizzers, and many can tell of famous rides after
the mob. A man who captured a great many Fizzers still
lives in Peechelha—where Morgan was shot-and is known
as "Jack the Fizzer.” He is the sire of the famous
horsewoman, Mrs. Ambrose, who owns and rides at Aus-
tralian shows Gratis, Nimrod, Innisfail, and other horses.

The yarn comes from Mb. Victoria, N.S.W.,

The two Marshes (aboriginals) and the three

theory that “ brothers of cracks, boss nr man, ain’t never

best sprint runners, and Fred, Ernie, anil C. A. Maitineer
are within two yards of each other in six score, and the
two first were, in their day, within three yards of world’s
championship form. Their father, in his day, was one of
the first three jockeys in Australasia, and he isn’t a bad

The manner in which the victorious Daimio
was trained for his engagements puzzled the Fb mington
touts considerably. All he was doing, so far as they conid
see. was an ordinary working gallop every morning, and
he never went near the schooling fences. Consequently,
the talent wouldn’t have him at any price. They were
not aware that, besides his morning gallop on the tracks,
he was taken over four or five miles of hilly, hunting
country around Maribyrnong, jumping everything he
came across, and carrying a 12st. man. Consequently,
when the race came on, he outjumped, outgalloped, and
outstayed everything.

The Turco-Figyptian Tobacco Co., which

renowned tobacco on its own plantations in Mace-
donia, where the unspeakable Turk possesses a
■oil and climate specially adapted to tobacco
culture. Nowhere save in his dominions docs it
present Quite the same delicate aroma, and all
attempts to grow an exactly similar quality else-
where have failed. Possibly the result is owing
to the fact that the blood and brains of almost
every race known to history have been spilt on
the Macedonian plains, and the soil has been
enriched bv old dead crusader and many other
fertilisers—anyhow, the result is incontestable,
whether the dead crusader is the cause or not.*

The Queensland bores already in operation
would supply 100 towns the size of Brisbane with
water. And yet this is only an insignificant frac-
tion of the real rainfall. According to geologist
Jack, the Darling only receives 1J per cent, of the
rainfall in its catchment basin, the remainder
soaking down into the cretaceous rocks. _ r lhe
question is, would a prolonged drought seriously
affect the output of the artesian wells in the West ?
Many authorities say it would.
Moses Coldwells, one of the Liberator
Building Society directors, happened to expire the
other day, and his decease is attributed (says the
cable) to the great mental worry occasioned by
the prosecution. Worry, one may observe, didn t
run Mo. Coldwells to earth until his old pal,
Jabez Balfour, had been fetched back to London.
He lived through the wails of busted shareholders
and the screams of the press as long as Jabez was
keeping retribution at bay. When the actual
prosecution arrived, the ex-member for Lambeth
North thought it time to die a natural death. He
couldn't do less under the circumstances, and he
might have had the good taste to suicide.
A perennially hard-up Adelaide citizen
recently had an order of five days’ imprisonment
issued against him on an unsatisfied debt-sum-
mons. Whereupon the prosecuting lawyer re-
ceived the following ;
My Dear Sir,—Yours yesterday’s date just received.
While sincerely thanking you, I am sorry to have so far
trespassed on your friendly forbearance, which I will do
no longer. If you will be good enough to take out a
warrant, and send Connor (my own particular sergeant)
down to escort me to gaol, I will meet him at the Glan-
ville Station (where the Largs train joins the Semaphore
line) at 9 o'clock sharp. As you are perfectly aware,
Wednesday evening is, from the debtor’s point of view,
the most eligible lime to commence a five days’ order, and
I am sure you will spare me the unnecessary annoyance
of being arrested by the 1< cal bailiff. Moreover, by baring
me arrested as I desire, you w ill ire doing me a great good
service, as on Friday I shall be able to again see tire only
doctor who lias ever thoroughly examined me, and in
whom I have every confidence as completely understand-
ing my constitution, and who is only available under cer-
tain circumstances. Youi s, &c.
Percy Spence has arrived in London, and

Blackie and Son have given him another book to
illustrate (lie did one for them in Australia,
Faveno’s “Secret of the Australian Desert”),
and lie has also another private commission to
illustrate a boy’s book. He writes: “The
Academy exhibition is stunning. Tadema,
Leighton, Stanhope Forbes, Luke Fildes and
many others are first-rate ; but there is an all-
pervading air of cleanliness about the pictures
that is positively sickening. When you see
Bastien Lepage or Pelouse, you feel quite re-
freshed after the academical work. The English
artist disdains dirt. His landscape has evidently
to be washed before he paints it. The idea of
having any dirt about the earth seems absurd to
these sweetly pretty painters. That a farmer
returning from work should have a speck of dirt
on him seems to the English artist an impossi-
bility.”
Mr. J. I, Marshall, the well-known Sydney

When old James Wilson owned St. Albans,
a big supporter of the stable, whom we will call
Joe, once matched a man for a sum of money in a
footrace. Not being altogether sure of the ped.’s
morals he sent an artful friend to interview him
and see if “ he would listen to reason ” for a con-
sideration. The “ped.” professed to be most in-
dignant, and wound up a vigorous protest by ask-
ing what the tempter thought his mother would
say if he were to lose a race he might have won !
Joe, on receiving the answer, was satisfied, and
piled on the “sugar,” thinking his man was all
right. But, alas and alack! at half the distance
the honest “ ped.” palpably fell, and the only
satisfaction Joe had was to yell in his ear, “ What-
ever will your mother say ? ”*
Some years ago an Israelite, who made a
small book, and a local trainer were suspected of
touting the St. Alban’s horses at work, but they
were not found out until one morning just before
a trial gallop. The then proprietor armed himself
with an ancient pistol, charged only with powder,
and went for a quiet walk round the track as if to
inspect it. Under the ample boughs of the acacia
hedge, about a quarter of a mile from the winning-
post, he noticed a heap of something which he
made for at quick march. At his approach up
rose the suspected parties (they had not seen the
pistol) and made off. Their movements were
greatly accelerated by a tremendous report, alter
which ditches and fences were taken in Grand
National style, and they got off clear, minus a
hat and an overcoat.*
Gossage’a prize soap, for which Gill Bros.,
of 33 York-street, are sole Sydney agents, marks
another advance in the great art and mystery of
cleanliness. In remote days the primitive Aryan
man was content to go wholly unwashed ; lie
accumulated vegetable mould from his cradle —if
he had one—to his grave. Then he occasionally
scraped himself with a flint. Later he began to
wash in a perfunctory fashion, and so the process
went on until now, in the cleanest circles of
society, soap-making has become a fine art, and
every respectable inhabitant washes himself
occasionally, if not oftener. Soap has gone
through many gradations ; it began with a bar of
a coarse and horrible yellow material which took
the skin off the patient in places and left him of a
bright red color, and it ends, so far, with Gos-
sage’s, pure and fragrant."

Hardly any of the big Australasian life-assur-
ance societies ever dreamt, in the good days of high
interest and constantly-increasing revenues, of putting
aside a respectable reserve-fund to cover losses at some
possible future date, when the value of their properties
and their mortgages might go down heavily. Only a
few of them, even now, make any serious effort in this
direction. The Mutual of Victoria has just £6020 to
covet possible depreciation on £900,000 worth of property,
or about 13s. 4d. per £lOO. The Widows’ Fund has
£3768 to cover possible losses on £1,200,000 worth of pro-
perty, or 6s. 3d. per cent. The balance-sheet of the
Mutual Life Association shows no reserve whatever.
Neither does that of the Colonial Mutual. The Govt.
Life Depaitraent of Maoriland has a reserve of £43,000,
equal to *.2 per cent., and the National Mutual has
£35,000, equal to over t 2 4s. percent. The City Mutual
(Sydney) has £l5OO (£1 ss. per cent.); the Temperance
and General, £2834, or almost the same as the City
Mutual; and the A.M.P. has the (by comparison) stupen-
dous reserve of £416,000, or £3 4s. per cent. This last
reserve, which shows out magnificently in contrast to
the others, has, however, all been accumulated in the
last two or three years, so that the present policy-holders
are paying for the want of forethought shown in times
past, and for the high bonuses of previous years. Still the
fact that it has been made shows a readiness to grapple
with the situation, and if the A.M. P. maintains its reserve
for the future no such trouble should again arise. Amongall
these offices the Maoriland Govt. Department is the best
protected, inasmuch as a comparal ively small proportion
of its funds are invested in land and mortgages—the
items where tire heaviest depreciation generally comes.
The A.M.P. conies next, and the National Mutual third,
while the rest are various distances behind—some of
them quite out of sight. The possibilities of a big insur-
ance office, with a million or two of mortgages and a
merely nominal reserve, or no visible reserve at all, are
alarming in a time of severe depression.
♦ » * *
Some of the reasons why a uniform and entirely
new form of bank balance-sheet should be enforced when
the new Banking legist dion comes along will be found in
the following facts: Among the banks doing business in
the three eastern provinces, the Bank of N.S. W., the
City of Sydney, Bank of New Zealand, Commercial of
Sydney, and A.J.S. don’t show the amount of their work-
ing expenses, so that whether the management is extra-
vagant or otherwise is not known even to the share-
holders. The A.J.S. lumps together its new fixed
deposits and its long-dated reconstructed deposits. The
Commercial of Sydney, Royal of Queensland, Colonial
(Melb.), Bank of Victoria, Queensland National and
8.N.Q., lump together their reconstructed deposits, new
fixed deposits, current accounts and “other liabilities”
in one awful mass. The City of Melbourne lumps
together reconstructed deposits, new deposits, current-
accounts, and amounts due to other banks. Among the
reconstructed banks the Commercial of Australia, Lon-
don and National(MelbJ are the only ones whiCfr show
accurately the amount of their old fixed deposits
still unpaid or not released, so that a definite
idea can be formed of how they are getting on at
wiping out their old liabilities. Also the Commercial
of Australia is the only one which shows separately the
amount of unrealisable assets of the old bank and the
amount of interest they yield, as distinguished from the
revenue from ordinary banking business, and it is the
only one which shows the amount of property on hand
apart from its own banking premises. The Union-and the
Bank of New Zealand are the only ones which explain
fully how their reserve-fund is invested or where it can be
found if wanted.
The National (Melb.) announces that its
advances are £5,813,000 “after deducting office re-
serves,” but what the office reserves are, or how much
they are, and consequently how much provision is made
against depreciation, doesn’t appear. The City Bank of
Sydney, which is about the briefest of the lot, seems
to lump together, in one item, bills discounted, Govt,
or other debentures, notes of other banks, miscellaneous
landed property, overdrafts, and mortgages. A few
banks distinguish between their assets in England and
those in Australia, but the majority don’t. Not one gives
separately the amount of advances on mortgage and those
on miscellaneous securities. Three or four state what
amount has been paid in interest on deposits, but most of
them lie low' on this point. Some of them state that pro-
vision has been made for bad anddoubtful debts, but not one
explains how much has gone in this direction, and many
banks don’t even allege that they have made any provi-
sion at all. The nearest approach to accuracy in this
respect is the Commercial of Australia, which shows the
amount regularly set aside to cover losses on its old
business; and the London and A.J.S., which show each
half-year the state of their contingency-fund set aside for
the same purpose. Also, in three cases the auditors only
state that the balance-sheet is correct “ according to the
books,” which means absolutely nothing. Under all
these circumstances the public, in most cases, knows
absolutely nothing about the condition of any bank
except what can be gathered from the agitated state of
the share-market it the directors try to sell out too
hurriedly before the crash arrives. A balance-sheet, with-
outa system of independent Slate audit, only' rests, in any
case, on the statements of the manager and directors,
and the evil is further aggravated by the fact that these
gentlemen, in many cases, practically state nothing at all.
♦ * ♦ *
One sufficient reason why the public should
prefer small banks to large ones is that the former are, in
most cases, much the safer of the two. As an example,
in the Royal Bank of Australia the unpaid capital is
equal to times the whole liabilities to the public ; that
of the Bank of N.Q. is equal to its whole liabilities, and
that of the Ballarat Banking Co. to 60 percent, of its
liabilities. On the other side, the unpaid capital of the
Queensland National or the City of Melbourne wouldn’t
cover one-tenth of what they owe to the public, and
many other large banks are in a very similar situation.
* * * »
The Vic. Bills of Sale Act, in existence some
years, was framed by the principal of a trade protection
society, and is about the best Australian measure of its
kind. It provides that before a B.S. can be granted 14
days’ notice must be given. This is published in the
trade circulars, so that creditors may be able to stop the
B.S. until their claims are satisfied. But why should the
banks and big pastoral oo.’s be able to get their stock-
mortgages and wool and crop liens through without any
notice of intention to file, while other people can’t get a
fiver on their furniture without 14 days’ previous pub-
licity?
* ♦ * *
One smart person, at all events, has got badly
left in the Maoriland gold-boom. A local merchant had
a lot of shares which, despite the general inflation, kept
going st°adily down. He deposited them with a broker,
giving instructions to sell at a certain figure ; but they
got further and further away from it every day. So the
owner went up to inspect the mine, and from there he
wired in frantic terms to hold on—not to sell at any price
—to refuse all offers, and various other things to the same
hysterical effect. Whereupon the agent concluded that
a big discovery had been made, and he promptly wired
back: “Shares sold at your price just before telegram
arrived.” And now that merchant is safely out of a bad
spec., and a broker with a huge bundle of unsaleable
scrip on hand wants to bite the globe to express his
feelings.

Nearly every fashionable Melb. hotel has its
tame money-lender (a rabid extortioner, as a rule), who
lives in the best rooms, fares sumptuously daily, and is
always prepared to judiciously stand a bottle in likely
“ pithneth ” quarters. The billiard-room marker, hall-
porter, the elevator man, and all the rest, are tipped to
give Shylock “ the office ”asto a lodger’s position. One
shark boasts that he has been making over £2OOO a year
profit on his hotel introductions.
It is said that empty Danish butter-kegs come
to Auckland (M.L.) to he filled with butter and shipped
hack to Denmark, where they are marked as Danish, and
shipped to London. Then the butter competes with the
Maoriland article in that great market under the brand of
some well-known Copenhagen exporter.

Mr. Deering, late S.A. Assistant Agent-General,
invested his retiring allowance of £2500 in buying an
annuity. The office got the best of the deal, for he died
within a year. “A relation of mine,” writes a Bulletin
correspondent, “failed in a similar bargain. At 60 she
invested all her money in buying an annuity, and she
limited the term to 20 years, as she was sure she would
not live past 80, and so got a little more money by the
arrangement. She survived till 95, however, and had to
rely on her family for the last decade.”

Edmund Mitchell, erst special correspondent
for the Age, &c., has returned to London from Westralia,
and, when the mail left, was engineering, with prospects
of success, a new mining co. called the Glasgow Westra-
lian Gold Mines. Principal features: (1) Vendors take no
cash and will rely upon the mine-returns. (2) Before
their shares rank for div. 100 per cent, must have been
paid to other shareholders. (3) No directors’ fees to be
paid; and, what is most unusual, there is no “waiver”
clause, all contracts and agreements being disclosed.
Capital, £15,000 only.

The Bulletin hears of 5-6ths of a mine being
nominally sold for a big sum to a man who, though he
paid no deposit, had the show bonded to him for four
months, and took away on his pack-horse of stone
estimated to contain 50oz. gold. That was five months
ago, and now the owners decline £lOOO to Is. that they
never see an oz. of the atone. The owners of that show
were never on the “ Barrier ” in the days of “ travelling
on the slug.”

At Fermoy opal field (Warrnambool Downs, 80
miles from Winton, 120 from Longreach), opened about a
year ago, £4OOO worth of excellent opals have been sold
to buyers, beside private deals. The opals, writes a Bul-
letin correspondent, are got at an average depth of 10ft.;
the deepest shaft in which good gems have been obtained
is 25ft. The opals are patchy, and the original mines
have been worked out. About 50 miners are on the
ground, and about the same number prospecting on
adjoining runs—upon one of which a couple of good finds
have been made. Last month Mr. Goldstein (S. Hoffnung
and Co., Sydney) bought about £l3OO worth of opal at
Fermoy ; Mr. Aplin, of Aplin and Co., Brisbane, about
£3OO, and Mr. Pender, of Melbourne, some £4OO worth—
amongst them one piece of sandstone opal of pipe forma
tion which realised £63.

“Economy’’ writes: Payable stone is some-
times accompanied by expensive management. At a
mine near Glen Wills, about 30 miners are employed.
There are no less than six bosses, consisting of local
director (stipendiary), manager, underground manager,
and three shift bosses. The 00. having no battery, some
of the first three named must find their billets tolerably
easy. This big expense, added to the poorer returns of
free gold (as the stone becomes more mineralised with
depth), and the cost (something like 30s. a ton) of getting
stone to the public battery, minimises shareholders’
chances of profit.

cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true.—

Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testi-
mony carries special weight, writes thus : To Herr Rassmusskn.- Dear Sir, - I think it my duty to
inform you that a course of your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who have all been cured by their
use. —Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb., July 18, 1892.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Pills completely cured i. ,£> of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention that several of my friends
to whom I have recommended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them; therefore, I consider you are deserving of success, wmco
I do most heartily wish you.
Yours gratefully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Hkkr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, atid
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper oi
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.
As witness; John Hagerman (my husband), caretaker Tivoli
Theatre, Castlereagh-street, Sydney.
A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which d’d
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Great Debility and Weakness Cured.
51 Barkly-street, Ballarat, Victoria, Aug. 29, 1892.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted must wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.
A Lady’s Wish Fulfilled.
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform you that your cele-
brated Alfaline Universal Pills cured me, when all other remedies and
doctors failed, of a stubborn case of Debility of 18 years’standing. My
wish is fulfilled at last,-and I don't know how to thank you enough.
Dear Sir, I shall recommend your Alfaline Remedies.to all sufferers I
. come across. You are quite at liberty to publish or make what use you
like of this testimonial, and anyone writing to me will have full
particulars. I am, yours respectfully, Mrs. E. SMITH, Port Mac-
quarie, Hastings River, N.S.W.
A Miraculous Cure.
The father of Mr. Peter Larsen, the celebrated Bandmaster to the Queensland
Military, writes as follows:
Ithaca st., Normanby Hill, Brisbane, Sept. 20, 1802.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir, —1 am- jubilant to inform you that your wonderful
Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a very obstinate internal Com-
plaint; and that, although I am now over 70 years of age, I feel as
strong as any young man, and shall always be grateful to yon.
Yours very truly, N. LARSEN.

CRAWFORD & CO.,
250 & 252 Fliuders-st., MEE HO URNE,
A young woman walked into Melbourne
Supreme Court, the other morning, and placed a
sultry affidavit before his Honor. She was a co-
res pondent wjiq, aoipehow, didn’t appear in a
divorce case tried Two iiponths ago, and she now
dropped in promiscumlidy with a view to quashing
the decree • nisi, which inis not yet been made
absolute. The damsel’s affidavit set forth that in
November, 1890, she was requested by the fair
petitioner, to live with her husband as his
wife, down at Qneenscliff, while the lady her-
self carried on a laundry with another fellow at
MeU>, The damsel did as desired, her paramour
passing (at Qneenscliff) as his lawful wife’s brother-
in-law. Previous to this arrangement she had, in
the capacity of domestic servant to the congenial
pair, set up amorous relations with the husband
under bis wife’s patronage. The course of illicit
love rah smooth because it was carefully levelled
for them by “missus.” Finally, in May last, the
wife visited her husband, when the damsel hap-
pened to be within earshot, and promised him
if he would refrain from opposing her divorce-
suit. He refrained, and —if the affidavit be truth-
ful—probably drew bis <£G. There seems to be a
beautiful lesson for married folks in the co-
respondent’s statement. It shows how peace and
goodwill may be maintained between a wife and
husband, after mutual affection is dead to all
feeling of jealousy, by the introduction of a third
partner into the firm. The lodger, instead of
causing grief and ructions, is, under these im-
proved circumstances, a poorer of oil upon
troubled waters, and the acquiescent third party
sails gracefully away to a new haven of shelter :
A LOBERTINE LOVE SONG.
When Love is dead, poor mortal thing I
Quite dead, not merely,dozing,
A dismal lay most dullards sing
The while ’tis decomposing.
Corruption crawls from cold desires
Across their lives ill fated ;
O fling the corse, when Love expires,
Upon some bright new passion’s tires—
’Tis easily cremated.
Fools case it in a gloomy shell
And oaken coffin polished.
Or plant it in a flowery dell
By worms to be demolished,
Placing a stone to mark the spot
Whereon decease is dated.
When Love is dead, embalm it not"
See that your furnace Ares are hot.
And have the thing cremated.
Nothing remains, save ashes grey,
Quite clean and disinfected ;
And they are better blown away
Than carefully collected.
Enjoy new raptures, strong and sweet,
Until each sense he sated
And Love’s last heart h is ceased to beat—
Then wrap it in a winding sheet
And get yourself cremated.
A New Cream Separator.
The Sharples Cream Separator is guaranteed
to obtain from the milk of the farmer’s cow
and Ids neighbor’s more cream than can be
separated by any other invention. Testimonials
are numerous and highly commendatory : “ it
skims clean and does it cheaply ; ” “ no other
machine can be compared to it; ” “it saves
money and is thus a money-maker;” “beats
all competitions on butter-yield,” &c., &c. It
began its prosperous career six years ago in
America, and the first model, though going
daily ever since, has cost for repairs but one
dollar. Its economy is inferable from its requir-
ing but one-third the steam, and but one-tenth
the oil of its best rival ; it needs neither engine,
shafting, gearing, nor belting. It occupies but
two square feet of space, is of the simplest con-
struction ; it can be cleaned in four or five
minutes. Moreover, no Sharpies machine has
ever burst, and the manufacturers stand alone
amongst prominent makers of separators from
the fact of no person ever having been injured
in the slightest degree by one of their machines,
although thousands are in daily use. And thus,
while other cream separators occasionally spread
havoc and death and hurl the unprepared
butter-maker into that mystic eternity where
they skim not neither do they milk—the
Sharpies goes faithfully on as smoothly as a top
upon a china plate, cooling and aerating the
cream, resulting in the finest butter and biggest
dividends. It is being introduced the whole
world over, and is already saving fuel, oil, life,
time and money in America, Europe, Australia
and Maoriland. It keeps on taking first
prizes at dairy shows ; it has secured every
important prize for the last five years in
America, including the gold medal at the
World’s Fair, Chicago. On the - *"whole, it is a
machine calculated to butter on both sides the
bread of the farmer who uses it. TheN.S.W.
and Queensland agents are Denham Brothers,
of Sydney and Brisbane.*
Younger and Co.’s ale—the celebrated
Revolver brand—is a cool, light beverage, whose
rich brown hue, when it is held up against the
summer sun of Australia, is inspiration for a
painter. If Rubens or Raffaele had painted it the
work would have ranked as a masterpiece.
Younger’s ale is clear, absolutely pure, sparkling
and invigorating, with no sediment in it and no
adulterants of any kind. Very few liquors can
equal it for quenching the great Australian thirst
—probably, in the December days, the greatest
thirst on earth. Then there is coolness and
refreshing shade in the pale, amber hue of this
famous ale, and its gurgle sounds like a stream
plashing down a ferny dell, and the snowy head
upon it suggests a view of a distant Alp, and the
man who drinks it feels as if he could lick six of
the men he was a minute previously, or twelve of
the men he would shortly have been if the refresh-
ment hadn’t arrived.*
i
Mr. P. R. Larkin, the popular proprietor
of the Prince of Wales Hotel, 778-784 Qeorge-
street, Sydney, has returned per Oceana after
doing a prolonged tour of the world. His return
is not likely to improve the quality of the liquor
at his hotel, or the general management of the
establishment, for both have been as good as they
well could be, but all the same a great number of
people will be glad to see the veteran after his
long absence. Mr. Larkin is one of the oldest-
established hotel-keepers in Sydney, and during
all his long career his personal character and his
liquor have always been able to stand inspection,
and the eagle eye of the Cold Tea fanatic has
never been able to find any trace of fusel oil or
Other adulterant in either of them. Also, so long
»s the Prince of Wales is under its present
nanig-ment, tin- proprietor intends that the
f. ii L dispersed there will lie, as heretofore, the
Dost to be obtained in the city, and that they will
oe sold at the lowest price which will enable him
to keep out of the insolvency court.*
With the first touch of spring all the
drapery houses seem anxious to exhibit their new
spring and summer novelties. Show days are the
means adopted of opening the seasons. Mel-
bourne Indies always look forward to these days
! when the fashions for the coming season are re-
vealed to them in the most attractive and
picturesque manner. Messrs. Hicks, Atkinson
and Sons, of Collins-street, announce that they
are making their special spring show this week,
and invite the inspection of all ladies who desire
to see the choicest examples of Parisian and Lon-
don taste.*
ENO’S “FRUIT SALT.”—In pimples and
blotches on the face, sallowness of the skin, and
depression of spirits, it is most useful, for not the
least of its recommendations is its resemblance to
fruit in the natural way in which it relieves the
system of effete or poisonous matter, which, if
retained, poisons the blood ; and its ad vantages
over fruit are that it can be always at hand when
required. Its preparation has been truly styled
one of the triumphs of modern chemistry. In hot
or foreign climates it is invaluable. It allays
nervous excitement, and restores the nervous sys-
tem to its proper condition (by natural means).
In the nursery it is beyond praise. Sold by all
Chemists and stores.*
Warner’s Safe Cure seems to have becom 6
almost indispensable on earth, and it is even
hinted that the regularity of the heavenly bodies
is secured by periodical doses of the same well-
advertised remedy. So when H. H. Warner and
Co.’s representative, who has just finished with
Sydney and suburbs, is met touring through
N.S. W. this month, he will probably be found
well worth inspection.*
Francis Abigail, in his press articles on the
prison system of N.S.W., incidentally alludes to
a “man who had married nine wives, all now
alive, and killed the child of the last one,” and
who, “by some extraordinary proceeding, gets
liberated in seven years.”

The agitation that justice may be (Jone in
regard to tlie hideous and unparalleled Mount
Rennie trial, which agitation The Bulletin is
proud of having .journalistically initiated and
kept alive for years, grows steadily, and will
be greatly promoted by the admirable series of
articles printed by the Australian Star. These
articles, which The Bulletin hopes to see re-
printed as a pamphlet, should be carefully studied
by every member of Parliament, as the question
will be made a burning one during the session.
The Barrier people, who remember Dis-
trict-Court Judge Gibson’s sneer : “ And these are
the men to whom democracy has given a vote ! ”
are somewhat entertained at the way in which his
Honor treated certain absent jurors the other day.
“1 will not,” he gravely said, “fine them on this
occasion, but direct that they shall not receive
their jurors’ fees.” At the hands of a Judge
noted for his severity, what a punishment! They
should not be paid for duties which they had not
performed 1 The defaulting jurymen, by the way,
were in the very first flight of local wealth and in-
fluence, yet for them it was sufficient punishment
that they should not receive what they had not
earned !
Detective Loniaine, who suicided in Vic-
toria, is said to have been another “ missing heir.”
According to the “story now circulating, he ran
away at an early age from his home and his
wealthy relatives, and became a humble policeman
under an assumed name. His chief purpose in
life seemed to be to keep out of sight of a certain
enormously rich uncle who de-dred to leave him
all his money, and when the old man died, and
Lomaine found that he was urgently wanted to
come along and inherit .£120,000, he blew his
brains out. Some mm have a hard time of it in
their struggles to avoid inheriting large sums of
money.

Dear Bulletin, —The true story of th e
disinterment and republication of Gordon’s poem>
“The Feud,” is as follows: In 1864, Mr. J. B-
Mather, now S.A. Advertiser artist, was
engaged in the printing-office of the Border
Watch, at Mount Gambier, S.A. The pro-
prietors pointed out some rough proofs in a box
and strictly enjoined their employes not to touch
them, as the matter contained was meant for'
limited private circulation. Mather was a small
boy, and the prohibition gave peculiar value to
these scraps of paper. So he took one and kept it
for years, as he was attracted by the poetry
and knew the author, who used to drop into
the Watch office and yarn for hours with
editor, printer, or devil. Returning to Mount
Gambier for a holiday, in ’9l or ’92, Mather asked
Mr. A. F. Laurie, one of the owners of the paper,
whether he remembered the existence of the poem,
and, if so, whether he thought a copy could be
found. The reply was that Mr. Laurie recollected
that only 30 copies were printed, and that he
believed it impossible to find any. However, a
search was rewarded by the rescue of one time-
stained pamphlet, which now lies on the table
before me. It is printed on good thick paper,
in paper covers, and, on the front page, bears
these words; —
The Feud,

Dedicated to Noel Paton, R.S.A.,
As a key to his illustrations of
‘•The Dowie Dens o’ Yarrow,”
By A. Lindsay.
Mount Gambier :
Laurie, Watson, and Laurie.
1864.
The explanation given for the omission of the sur-
name is that Gordon did not wish to admit the
authorship, except to his friends. Mather gave a
copy of the poem to Editor Bonython, who sent it
to Mr. A. Patchett Martin, in England, and also
published it in the S.A. Chronicle. —Yours, W.

Lady Colchester says to an interviewer :
“Revolutions pass and leave behind them great
benefits. We are passing through a critical time
and some of the exaggerations of emancipated
womanhood are sad; but one day the exaggera-
tion will pass, the senseless chatter of the new
womanhood will disappear like foam, and the
strong, pure current of the strengthened and
widened sphere of woman’s usefulness will be seen
flowing peacefully below.” After which it is sad
to find that Lady C. is on the Grand Council of
the Primrose League, an organisation intended to
check political advancement by encouraging new
womanhood in acute snobbism.

HER MAJESTY
AND
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE
Prince »r Wales
Retribution.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He generally cruised in the black depths tmdet
the lee of the breakwater. Sometimes a well-put
stone from the pier threw up the water a yard or
so from his visible fin—somewhat shattered by an
ill-timed frolic with a working dredge. The
gloomy wharfinger, pondering certain facts and
possibilities, had dubbed him “Retribution,” and
the name had stuck. And in this disagreeable
manner did he connect his name and himself
with the family of Joe Simpson.
On Sunday afternoons it was Joe’s custom to
unbend his mind from the boiler-plate and rivet,
and woo the lighter fancies of the sea. This day
Joe had permitted his little girl to accompany
him. He regretted the impulse; for she was
restless, and disturbed the Sabbath fisherman’s
calm.
“Let be—let it be.” A fillip on the ear sends
the child whimpering to the rails. She was
always fingering the bait. A woman strolls down,
lurching occasionally as her ragged boots strike
the uneven woodwork. She is on speaking terms
■with several firemen belonging to the vessels on
the berth, and from the fumes of yesterday’s orgy
springs tlie conviction that it is Saturday after-
noon still. A twist of red hair is blown into the
corner of her large, smiling mouth. Three men
are fishing, shoulder to shoulder, rod to rod; a
half-turned cheek catches her eye.
“ Why, splice me if it ain’t Joe 1 ”
She comes forward with many greetings learned
from the lips of sailor-men, and permits her hands
to wander affectionately about his head.
“ Gerrout! ”
She recoils with lofty assumption.
“Don’t threaten me, Joe Simpson; not me,
d’ye hear?” . . . ...
Hereupon she mentions, in conjunction with
Simpson, the name of a well-known fighting
stoker; also the other fishermen appear to have
assumed a taunting aspect, and the aggressive
stoker is apparently willing to fight any number
of persons at her bidding until he dies from
exhaustion. She cracks nuts on an empty seat,
and flings the shells at an elderly gentleman who
walks the pier regularly after Sunday-school.
The black fin drifts over with the tide. A surf
springs along the line of storm-tossed boulders.
“ Keep your damned fingers from the bait ! ”
Joe is angry and raises a jack-knife to rap Little
Yellow-Hair’s knuckles. She creeps away with
tear-filled eyes. Some one lands a kicking
flounder.
From afar the bedraggled creature lifts up her
voice in querulous song; the elderly gentleman,
up for- the third time, remonstrates. She sinks
into a monotonous crooning, edged with blas-
phemy, Her besotted memory wanders back to
the filmy past before the fall—when she was a
waitress at the “Welcome” boarding-house, where
Joe promised to marry her—“ the swine ! ”
“ Who are you, eh? ” From the inside of her
bleared eyes she glances sullenly at the fretting
child. „
“ I’m Bessie Simpson, please. The yellow-
haired mite backed unconsciously from the frown-
ing, begrimed face.
“ Come here, you little hussy, d’ye hear? ’
But Bessie only backed faster. The woman
darted forward, throwing out her hands—perhaps
it was a warning gesture. There was a little cry*
a splash. The black fin disappeared.
“Gawd! there’s old Retribution sneaking
under the piles, Joe. Ain’t he a daisy? Beta
caaer he’s bigger’n the Customs launch. What’S
that? O Christ ! ”

ALBA DORION.
A Coolgardie Hush .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some weeks ago a prospector arrived in Coolgardie
from “out,” bursting with the news that rich
alluvial had been struck near Lake Cowan. Al-
ready 10,000 oz, had been brought in, he said, and
lodged with one of the banks. The papers located
the find 75 miles from the township, and about
two miles from Lake Cowan. That was good
enough for Coolgardie. . M „
My mate and myself got the “office” very early.
Our luck was in. We hired a camel (cow) and
loaded her with a fortnight’s provisions, and dry-
blowing utensils such as picks, dishes, sieves, etc.
Loading a camel is an art which wants practice.
Our tins of concentrated indigestion rolled about
all over the saddle, and the ropes we tied would
have shocked a sailor. However, with the aid of
two men who knew nothing about it, and another
who had packed a horse when he Was a boy, we
fixed our stuff on the ship of the desert so that it
wouldn’t fall off to any great extent. Then we
St The'road was like all Westralian roads—a dreary
strip of dust and sand, running through country
covered with the eternal gum, stunted scrub and
bastard saltbush, broken now and again by huge
granite rocks, with soaks at their bases. At one
of these we halted for our first camp, 27 miles
from Coolgardie. About 9 a.m. next day we were
overtaken by the first sign of rush We had seen, in
the shape of a weary and draggled cyclist, Who
had left town with a handful of biscuits and a tin
of meat. We gave him some “ tinned dorg” and
a drink, which put so much heart into him that
he instantly began his return journey.
That day we negotiated 30 miles. About 4
p.m. next day we calculated that we had come 84
miles from (joolgardie, and decided to strike in
due east next morning and hit the lake. We soon
struck the new 13 1 in das Hoad and the vanguard of
the rush —twenty or thirty men with camels or
paokhorses. Each man had a friend who had seen
the gold brought in from the find, and every eagle
was confident of reaching the carcase to-
m Next day a party of us, eight in all, continued
our course eastward. Our leader (whom we
named Stanley, because he always went on_ in
front to show us the way, and invariably lost him-
self) was a cheery, imaginative youth who had
been everywhere, and who knew everyone you
could mention— including Rudyard Kipling, who,
he said, was “ a long red-’aired bloke, wot used to
be a barman in Coolgardie.” The anxious man of
the party bestrode a rugged Westralian horse,
whose condition spoke of a li. ) spent in rushing
on a little glass and less Water. His saddle was a
blanket secured by a rCpe surcingle: ahd another
bit of rope, thrown across and looped at each end,
made grand stirrups. The bridle was a handsome
combination of rope and fencing - wire. ihe
anxious man wore dungaree trousers far too short in
the leg, and he had lengthened them by sewing
bag on the ends with string and a pack-needle.
We discovered that he cooked well, so we always
made him sleep in the dampest places, so that he
would be up and have breakfast ready early. Ihe
rest of the party were of the nondescript type
that always haunts rushes —except one fat man,
who never spoke, but blew his nose _ most artisti*
cally, and spent all his spare time in baking and
eating sodden damper.
Next day we reached the north side of Lake
Cowan at a place called Binyarinya, and, getting
up on a high rock in the neighborhood, saw that
the eastern side was barren and sandy, and a
very unlikely place for alluvial. Stanley, of course,
had been right through it, and confirmed our ideas.
So we steered north-east, in the hope of striking
tracks, but found none. In the afternoon we
altered our course and struck the main road; and
then we met the rush in earnest. Parties of old
dry blowers, numbering from ten to thirty, sur-
rounded our group every half-mile, and demanded
the road to the indecent rush. “Ain’t you bin
there ? No kid now ! ’’ On one occasion we saw
a large party which had hired an Afghan and a
few camels to take them out; and now that the
locality of the rush was found hard to determine,
they turned on their Afghan with “You take us
rush! We paid money! You take us rush!
“Which way rush?” asked the bewildered Asiatic.
“You tell which way rush and I take you rush .
The dry blowers threatened to grease the Mahom-
medan with bacon if he didn’t 44 take them rush
instantly, and he came over to us to borrow some
cartridges. We lent them and left speedily.
Where the road crosses Lake 4 Lefroy we met
the first teams from town. The horse-power was
in every case totally inadequate to the weight of
the loads, so all hands had to yoke up abreast of a
sapling, and assist in dragging the drays through
the water. Most of the men resented being turned
into beasts of burden, and expressed a desire to
handle “the bloke wot started this (indecent)
rush.” After crossing Lake Lefroy, we heard a
rumor that there had been nu hud at Lake Cowan,
but a rich patch had been struck in the Wood-
giemoola district, 12 mi.es S.E. of the Cardiff
Castle mine. We reached camp at Wbodgiemoola
early next afternoon, and loafed about till dark.
It was raining, and everything was gloomy and
miserable. Then the fat man spoke for the first
time i he looked up from his sodden damper and
proposed athletic sports. No one took any notice,
but we were all glad that he had not spoken
before. .... ...
The anxious man began feeding his horse with
our oatmeal and rice, and, when we objected, went
away to find some grass. He returned with the
news that there was a duck on the lake, opposite
our camp, and proposed that' someone should
shoot it for tea. Stanley had a repeating Win-
chester and 14 cartridges. He could also shoot—
“ not too stinkin’.” He fired 12 shots without hit-
ting anything, even the lake ; with the thirteenth
he blew one ear off the anxious man’s horse;
and with the last bullet he shot the duck dead.
The anxious man moved about and framed blas-
phemies, but the horse didn’t seem to mind. One
bf the party owned a dog, a champion retriever
which he was never tired of praising. It had
taken goodness knows how many prizes ; and the
owner’s yarns about its wonderful sagacity had
brightened many a weary mile. The dog was
sent to retrieve the bird, while his owner stood
proudly on the bank and said many times “ Good
dog! Go fetch.” The dog understood. He
reached the bird and swam with it to the other
side of the lake, where he proceeded to eat it at
All the "next three days we Wandered about
seeking “rush.” Our provisions Were nearly
done, and we realised that it was time to go
back. When we reached town we found that a
crowd of hoaxed miners had already returned, and
wanted to tear down the newspaper offices. The
promoter of the rush was seized, kept under lock
and key for one night, and then taken out in a
cart next day, guarded by four desperate dry-
blowers determined to make him show where the
lOjOOOoz. were taken from. However, he escaped
from his guards one night, and has not been seen
since. How that man must have laughed !
Ooolgardie, July 5.
PORTHOS.
Statements are made, and denied, that
the Salvation Army in Melb. has led to respect-
able women marrying criminals. In one case,
the result was a divorce, but in another there has
been 10 years’ allegedly-happy union.
The Melbourne weekly which lately pub-
lished the portrait of a bar-lady as a type of
beauty would greatly oblige_ The Bulletin by
taking credit for the aforesaid work of art in its
next half-dozen issues. The average person who
happens to note a newspaper illustration in a
shop window, or elsewhere, is sooner or later
bound to believe that he, or she, “ saw it in The
Bulletin.” Not wishing to rob a contem-
porary of any distinction it is justly entitled to,
The Bulletin now mentions that the type of
beauty aforesaid was not, as alleged by popular
error, published in these columns. There are two
or three reasons why the announcement seems
called for, and one of them is that the young
lady’s portrait turns out to be not much like the
original.
Somebody writing in Sydney D.T. remarks
that N.S.W. National Gallery ‘‘looks all the
better for the weeding-out to which the pictures
have been subjected in consequence of the loans
to country districts,” and proceeds to say that
“ Early Morning on the Doggerbank ” should cer-
tainly not have been marked for removal. ‘‘lf
large canvasses are necessary,” says the writer,
“ as well as small ones, to complete the loans to
Bathurst, Goulhurn and Newcastle, then there are
a pair of bush scenes—huge, upright pictures, high
up on the southern wall of the Australian court—
and there is Mr. Johnstone’s painting, “Off the
Track,” that suggest themselves as being in need
of country air. And, though this may seem a
poor compliment to the people of the towns
referred to, it is manifestly the correct thing
to do, seeing that Sydney is a centre,” &c.
It is indeed a ghastly thing that there should be
found in Australia any man capable of expressing
such sentiments in regard to “Off the Track” —
which was, until lately, skied over De Neuville’s
“ Rorke’s Drift.” “Rorke’s Drift” is a great
work, but “ Off the Track ” is also a great picture
—one which contains more of the soul of the grim
Australian bush than all the other Australian
pictures in the Gallery bundled together. John-
stone is a genius who has left Australia for ever,
and “ Off the Track ”is his worthy memorial. It
is a canvas to which every true Australian takes
off his hat.

The Old Camp Oven.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We don’t keep a gran’ pianner in our hut
beside the creek,
An’ I’m pretty certain Hanner couldn’t
bang it, anyhow,
But we’ve got one box of music, an’ I’d
rather hear its squeak
Than the daisiest cantata that’s bin
fashioned up to now.
It’s an ole camp-oven merely, with a handle
made of wire,
But no organ built could nearly compen-
sate to me fer it
When I come off graft an’ find it playin’
tunes afore the fire,
An’ I’m feelin’ sorter vacant, but jes’ won-
derfully fit.
In its sizzle, sizzle, sizzle,
There’s a thousan’ little airs,
An’ no man can sit an’ grizzle
’Bout his troubles an’ his cares
Whiles the flames are gaily windin’.
An’ the tea is down to brew,
An’ thq ole camp-oven s grindin’
All the reels he ever knew.
When the %et winds meet an’ whip me in
the early winter nights.
An’ the hissin’ hailstones clip me all the
way across the flat,
As I battle for’ards, water-logged, to’ard the
beck’nin’ lights,
There is alwus there a welcome to console
a chap for that.
For my little wife is glowin’ brisk an’ bright
beside the lamp,
An’ the ole camp-oven’s goin’. Gosh ! I
feel jes’ like a kid
As I peel an’ sluice so slippy, an’ I hear the
storm winds vamp
To the singin’ of the oven when the missus
lifts the lid.
There’s a sizzle an’ a splutter
An’ a whirr of many harps,
Where’s the instrument can utter
Such a maze of flats an’ sharps ?
Not fer me the great creations
When the ole camp-oven plays
“ Home sweet Home ” with variations
At the end of workin’ days.
In' tlie evenin’s dim an’ hazy, stretched out-
side along a butc,
Feelin’ reasonably lazy, blowin’ clouds
that curl an’ climb,
l can hear the old camp-oven on the logs
before the hut,
Rippin’ out a mellow chorus that jes’ suits
the place an’ time.
If we strike it in the ranges, or The Win'-
mill turns out well,
I suppose there’ll be some changes, an’ I’ll
wanter make things gee,
But the time will never happen when I’ll be
so steep a swell
That the ole camp-oven’s measure won’t
be melody to me.
’Neath its bubble, bubble, bubble,
There’s the lilt of jigs an’ reels ;
All the common kind of trouble
That the “ ’orney-’anded ” feels
Is wiped out in half a minute
By the restfulness it brings,
An’ the peaceful rapture in it
When the old camp-oven sings.

EDEARD DYSON.
Followed Under! A Queer Quest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ In the interests of science,” said Fetherstone
—and fired.
One of the creatures fell shrieking from the tree;
the other two sprang nimbly down, skipped to
and fro for a moment, then squatted chattering
beside the fallen.
The shooter made a wry face. “Painfully
human sort of thing,” he said. “Never did like
firing at apes—but this looks uncommonly like a
new species.”
He put a cartridge in the empty barrel, crept
through a patch of lallang, looked again, and
thrilled with self-congratulation.
“ Entirely new species, by all that’s lucky:
wonderfully smooth coat! Nearly the color of a
Dyak, too ! Pity ! —but I must have another !”
A dozen yards further, upon hands and knees ;
then the rifle rose slowly—steadied—went down
again with a jerk.
“Why, bless my sou' ! they are Dyaks—they
can stand erect? It’s a man I’ve potted—or a
boy, rather! Hang the imps ! —such climbing
would have taken anybody in ! ”
Fetherstone mustered up his little stock of
Dyak and walked out of the sheltering lallang.
The wounded boy was being helped on to his feet
by the others; the white man got unseen within
20 yards, and then a fresh surprise stopped him.
Yard-high and stark naked—these three creatures
were not boys, after all! They were men! —and
one of them grizzled. Fetherstone closed his eyes
—then looked again ; but there was no doubt
about it—these pigmies were adults ! Before
him stood three of the “monkey-men” of the
Malays—the orang karra whose existence he had
so often laughed to scorn.
“Human beings, sure enough ! —and well-built
little—hullo ! they’re off ! ” —and Fetherstone
started, top-speed, after the dwarfs as they fled
down towards the lake—the wounded one holding
his own, and all three traversing the ground so
fast that the white man only got to the bank in
time to see them vanish heads-first into the dark-
green water.
“Dive like dagger-birds, of course !” he said, as
he sat down on the rocky verge. “Well, I’ve
seen ’em for myself, at all events, though it’ll be
hard to get any white man to believe me ! ”
Then he lit his pipe, and waited, and watched,
and wondered, for nearly five minutes before the
astonishing truth burst upon him. They weren’t
coming up at all. He jumped to his feet as he
remembered the Dyak assertion that these people
lived under water !
“ Which, of course, is rubbish. And yet, if
they’d showed even their noses, I must have seen
’em; the lake’s like glass.”
He tucked his Martini under his arm, and
patrolled the bank until he had determined that,
of two things, one must be true. Either the
pigmies were still in the water —drowned, or they
had left it through some passage with a sub-
aqueous entrance. The rock was volcanic basalt,
rising gradually backwards to the thunder-smitten
hill that stood out black and naked against the
pale-green slopes of jungle behind. Fetherstone
looked back to the ridge from which the dwarfs
had started, followed with his eye the track of
their flight, and marked that the spot they had
plunged from was not the nearest to their starting-
place. “ If there’s an under-water hole, it’s there-
abouts,” he decided. “They’d make a line for
it, of course.”
He got his clothes off, strapped his sheath-knife
round his loins, dived, and bottomed at about
20ft. Along the rock he groped as he rose—it
was solid to the surface. He scrambled out, moved
eight or nine feet along the edge, took breath, and
plunged again ; and this time, as the water forced
him upwards, he came upon a greater darkness in
the shimmering shadows—an opening into which
he swam. But still the water lifted him, until his
back was lightly pressed against a roof of rock.
This, with half-a-dozen inward strokes, he cleared,
and found his head, next moment, out of water,
but in profoundest darkness. Further in he swam,
until his feet touched sloping bottom and he
scrambled out upon smooth rock.
So far, his keen exploring interest had left no
room for fear; but now, as he strove to pierce a
darkness inconceivable, he shuddered. Could he
find the way out again ? Yes !—in that direction
was a faint something—a trifle less intensity of
gloom, and with a nervous dash he went down,
swiftly along the tunnel, and up again into the
reassuring sunlight. But, as he dressed, ho took
shame to himself. He, a pioneer of science ? The
first white man to behold the legendary pigmies of
Borneo ! —was he going to turn tail upon further
discovery when the way was straight before him?
He put down the coat he was about to don, took
from it a little vulcanite case, and from that again
a small thermometer, the place of which he sup-
plied with vestas. Off then went his clothes
again, and, with the little case of matches fas-
tened to a bootlace round his neck, he made the
sub-aqueous trip once more.
It was a cleft-like cave, with upward-sloping
floor, and walls that narrowed inwards till they
seemed to meet. But, with a second match, the
shivering adventurer found the angle not com-
plete. Where should have been the apex was a
lofty slit, just wide enough to let him through
into the warmer air of a natural passage that led
gently upwards till, when his seventh match went
out, there came, reflected on the rock above him,
an intermittent reddish glow that strengthened as
he went. Then before him he saw a transverse
ridge thrown into outline by the leaping light be-
hind it. Fetherstone looked over and down, for
far below him was the floor of the mighty cave he
dimly saw.
There they were !—“ monkey-men,” “ water-
dwarfs,” or what not!—squatting, jabbering and
eating round the fire that snatched here and
there out of the gloom a faint indication of the
lofty roof. In sable silhouette upon the hither
side of the blaze, and touched into ruddy bronze
upon the further, these half-hundred pigmies filled
the watcher with a horror he had not felt for more
repulsive savages—an odd perversion of the solid
sense that served him well enough in upper air.
The gnomes of German story—the “ wee folk ” of
his native land—a hundred legends jostled in his
brain, till at the need for instant action the cob-
webs cleared away.
Beyond the fire the cave-floor rose again to
where, almost level with the watcher’s place, there
showed upon the gloom a little patch of greyish
light. 111-defined and faint—it could have but
one source. “Daylight,” said Petherstone to
himself. “There’s an opening over there from
the hill. Water’s a short cut, I suppose.”
To catch a better view he stood upon the ridge
of rock—sent a loose stone scattering down —and
was seen.
The little women squealed and snatched up
their doll-like children—then, with a shrill yell,
the little men started up the slope towards the
glimmering white figure of the enemy. For half-
a-minute Fetherstone scorned to bolt. He even
laughed ; but then came “flick, flick” upon the
rocks around him, and he knew that it was no
laughing matter. These were sumpitan-darts, and
back he rushed into the rocky corridor, bruising
himself cruelly as he stumbled through the pitchy
darkness, and falling plump into the unseen water
before he thought he had got near it.
Two Dyaks, wondering over a rifle and a heap
of clothes, saw, rising from the deep, a battered
human countenance, and put a hundred yards
between them and the bank before they ventured
to look back. The Antu—if Antu it was---was
putting on the Whiteman’s leg-sheaths, and calling
to them, in good Malay, not to be a pair of idiots,
“ And the voice,” said one of them, as he told
the tale that night to his gaping fellows, “ was
the voice of Fersun Tuan. Then went we back,
trembling, and behold, it was the Tuan himself!
And when we asked of him the meaning, he said
a strange thing. ‘ I have been,’ he said, ‘ among
the water-dwarfs! ’ ”
An awe-struck silence followed, and when, at
dawn next morning, Fetherstone was stepping
from his door, he stumbled over a basket of
mangoes, with two pencil-fishes crossed upon the
fruit. It was the offering to a god !
“ Your career’s finished, Phil. Fetherstone ! ” he
said to himself, as he kicked the whole concern off
the platform. “ You can’t get higher than
apotheosis ! ”
