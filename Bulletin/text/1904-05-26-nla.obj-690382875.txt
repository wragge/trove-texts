THE BED PAGE.
The Heroic Soldier.
THE success of Lieut. Bilse’s book, A Little
Garrison Town, is of course a success of
scandal. The book relates rather badly,
in the literary view, a story of life with the
idle German army. Bilse’s material is taken from
the typical years of his comrades and subordinates.
He exhibits captains and majors drinking, dicing,
and wenching while waiting impatiently for a
war- that shall supply the reason of their exist-
ence : he exhibits corporals and privates humi-
liated and tyrannised by their superiors in
rank, oppressed by a load of drill and
discipline that brutalises their manhood. An
exposure of fact, an overturning of stony con-
ventionality to show the foul decay and noisome
reptiles underneath. The book made its author
notorious and earned him imprisonment at the
hands of outraged Decorum; it has been trans-
lated into half-a-dozen languages; yet doubtless
many who read it in English will wonder what all
the fuss was about.
But the book’s significance is far greater
than the book, especially in Germany. Bilse
is an officer whose mipd has been aroused
from the torpor of professional routine: he
opens his eyes, walks out of his place,
and lifts himself above the accustomed formula of
• million men to ask To what end ? Why ? It is
Social Democracy in epaulettes : a thing to make
Bismarck turn in his grave. And Bilse urges ils
it essential that officers should be ignorant and
arrogant, that privates should be treated cruelly ?
ia it impossible that the military brute, either
tyrant or slave, should be converted into a man ?
His German simplicity is curiously seen : he de-
sires and pleads that his brother-officers shall
educate themselves and elevate the men they
command: he has a vision of a modern Puritan
array, realising its true national function, realising
■its features of inferiority to other classes of the
nation, open to all sweet influences, attaining all
noble ends. His sincerity is almost pathetic.
And he does nob comprehend. Military men-
tality is everywhere of a low type. One profes-
sional soldier in a standing army repeats another.
European military officers, writes Albert Lantoine,
do not feel it necessary to cultivate general intelli-
gence : they exist to defend a nation, and for
nothing else. Their business gives no incitement
to profound thinking or generous aspiration.
From morning till night they spend their time in
■watching the grotesque exercises of men who
range themselves carefully in order while shouting
out numbers, or in making sure that the regi-
ment’s breeches are correctly fastened, and that
there is ho dirt in the regimental ears. After a
day so well filled they find relaxation in drink, or
women, or cards.
J*
Yet they are potential heroes. True; but the
point is that their heroism is in exact proportion
to their lack of high intelligence. Only men who
have no full sense of the value of individual
life or individual freedom can shout “ Mori-
turi te . salutamus ” at the beck of a Caesar.
To go to death like a brute when titular
authority bids is the part of a brute, not
of a man. To charge unreasoiingly like the
“ noble Six Hundred ” is the part of a fool or a
slave. Just in proportion as a man s mind
widens, so does he lose that apathy in- the face ot
death which is the essence of barbaric heroism.
The civilised gladiator has to be drugged to
die with alcohol, or maddened with excit-
ing music. The British army does not nowadays
face plain impossibilities : as Kipling points out,
it runs away. Like Lieut. Bilse, it asks To what
end ? Why ? It dares do all that may become a
man, but it understands that the reasonless accept-
ance of extinction is becoming only to the brute.
The point is not without its local application.
To the north we see,in the Japanese a race in
whom barbaric instincts persist vaingloriously.
Death for the Mikado is prized as an individual
ideal. When European troops hung back during
the Chinese war, the Japanese advanced cheerily
to doom. In face of shot and shell theirs was the
superior morale. Why? Because the Japanese
mental attitude is still the slave’s attitude of
implicit obedience to a master: the civilised
European mind demands an explicit reason for
authority, a clear justification. of self-sacrifice.
And with this nation of scientific fanatics Aus-
tralia may presently be contending for the empire
of the Pacific, even possibly for the empire of
Australia. Is she ready ? Is she making ready ?
A Historical Mystery.
N.S.W. Education Dept, is still encouraging
its children to buy and read the remarkable
History of the Australian Colonies compiled by
Joseph Finney, B.A.—that history full of literal
and grammatical blunders such as the reference
to “a track about 200 miles square” (p. 104), or
“ preserving the land for the Moaris’" (p. 310), or
“ the strife ... which centred around ” (p. 92), or
“the production of many of the most valuable
products” (p. 330). N.S.W. Education Dept, is
still encouraging its children to learn and digest
the remarkable maps in that remarkable History,
including a map of Queensland railways that
omits Cairns, and joins the Cairns and Cooktown
lines in one most remarkable line. In short, the
History is still being sold with all the errors that
two and a-half years ago exacted three columns of
this space to state only a portion of them. So
foolish or so mulish is N.S.W. Education Dept,
je
Therefore, apparently, a contributor is stimu-
lated to express* new horror at the old History.
He writes —
The extraordinary History of the Australian Colonies,
by Joseph Finney, 8.A., perpetrates an error in its very
title, inasmuch as “ Australian ” is strained to cover New
Zealand, Fiji, Samoa (spelled in the contents page
“ Somoa ”), and the New Hebrides. The book is lop-
sided and disproportioned. The titles of sub-sections of
chapters are clumsy. We have, for instance, such mon-
strous appellations as “ The Portugal and Spain Period of
Australian Discovery,” the Holland period, and the Eng-
land-France period, when there are usable adjectives like
Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, English, and French. There
was, moreover, no Portuguese period of Australian dis-
covery, and very little Spanish. The argument as to
European knowledge based on old maps can properly be
left with experts.
The author styles De Quiros “ captain and chief pilot
of Phillip’s expedition. He was properly the navigator,
I as De Torres was the ammiral (not “ the second in com-
mand ” as Mr. Finney states). The ammiral was in those
ancient days not a navigator, but a chief holding a mili-
tary command. It is written that De Torres “ must
have discovered Australia.” We know that he sailed
through the Straits which bear his name. Says Mr.
Finney, “he probably sighted its shores.” The. opening
section of the book is a catalogue of “ probabilities.”
Considering the limits of the book, too much space is
devoted to discovery. Pelsart and the English Dumpier
mean everything of value for the western coast; Cook,
everything for the eastern and for English settlement.
The French had practically as little to do in the matter
as the ancient Trojans.
Coming to the settlement of New South Wales, candour
would have made a more explicit statement. Sydney
was not founded with a view that the colony “ might in
time counterbalance the loss in America." Sydney was
founded as a penal rubbish-heap whereon to shoot crimi-
nals, because the independence of America closed the old
plantations to the off-scourings of the gaols in England
and Ireland. The utopian schemes put forward by Matra
and Young were never entertained by the English autho-
rities. Mills, G. C. Lewis, and other writers insist that all
British colonisation was founded on transportation and
slavery. The beautiful colonising ideals attributed to
I King’s advisers are as much a matter of myth as
-ernor Phillip’s alleged speech at Dawes Point. Mr.
ney is hugely and quite unnecessarily complimentary
>oor Phillip “ as the founder of a new colony, destined
irwards to grow great and free.” The voyage of the
irst Fleet” is gratuitously detailed—a great waste of
ee. Everything in Australia’s history genuinely pic-
esque is barely touched upon.
&
Vhy are the years extending 1 between 1788 and 1810
iuped in a period as “A Crown Colony of the Military
pe”? The four Governors ruling at the time were all
irter-deck men. Macquarie, the first of the British
;itary officers, did not arrive until 1811 ; and then
lowed a long succession of Major-Generals and Colonels
tp nearly the time when responsible government was
inted. Then the “social” governor was instituted,
:ied by the occasional “official” vice-royalty. But
. Finney is intensely fond of labels and periods. His
:ond time-allotment is from 1810 to 1831, when New
nth Wales becomes a Crown Colony of the Ceylon type,
e third period reaches from 1831 to 1850—when the
lony becomes free —which, we may state in passing,
,s not until six years afterwards —and possesses a “ wool
i.” Of course, there is also a “ gold era.” The trouble
out these periods and eras is that they are nob
fficiently distinct one from the other to parcel off in
is happy-go-lucky fashion.
Moreover, such meagre modifications as were made
administration prior to the granting of responsible
■vernment were the outcome of bitter agitation on the
rb of emancipated prisoners ; the originally free were
nsistent enemies of change. The cessation of trans-
udation did not make New South Wales a free colony ;
ere were still great numbers of convicts to be absorbed
to the manumitted population. Responsible govern-
ent was not the final link in a chain of continuous
ivelopment. It was the offspring of the discovery of
fid. The new Constitution was not evolved : it was
■eated.
J*
Mr. Finney’s caption “From a Crown to a Free
olony: the Wool Era ” is erroneous. The squatters
ere dearly and deeply in love with convictism. Con-
icts provided them with preeminently the cheapest form
t labour. Unfortunately, Mr. Finney’s effort to be con-
ise often makes him obscure, and he attempts in
rrangement of his matter under specific heads what
rould have been better done by a good index. His sins
re mainly sins of omission. He leaves out all the
olour, all the light and shade of events as they have
een recorded by eye-witbesses. He presents no con-
inuous narrative. His method of book-making is after
he manner of Tit Bits and Answers.
In the Victorian section, it is stated that the escape
-iade by that colony from the drawbacks of a convict
rigin was a narrow one. This is true to the extent that
’ictoria was hot used as a-penal-headquarters, but prior
o the cessation of transportation and the discovery of
•old the whole of settled Australia was over-run
iy expired-term prisoners and ticket-of-leave men. In
he early days of settlement Victoria was the happy
mnbing-ground of gangs of bushranging desperadoes,
ix-convicts and gaol-breakers. In the Victorian section,
is throughout the book, there is nothing illuminative,
lothing illustrative. The facts are there, and the dates,
frim and gaunt, stark and stiff. But the deductions are
>ften wrong and always superficial. In short, Mr.
Finney displays a very plentiful lack of historical culture.
For instance, referring to Farm Cove, he says, “ Here the
convicts were set to work. . . . under the direction ofthe
Sovernor’s own servant, one of the two or three men in
;he settlement who knew anything of agriculture ” ; but
he doe 3 not tell us that this “Governor’s own servant”
was Philip Schaffer, a German, who came out with the
First Fleet as an agricultural superintendent, chiefly with
a view tp attempt the culture of tobacco on behalf of the
Government, and that he was the first free man to under-
take the cultivation of soil in the colony. Nor does he
tell us of James Ruse, the convict, who entered on his
farm of 30 acres at Parramatta on the 25th February,
1789. Surely these facts are of more interest than specu-
lations about the type the Government of New South
Wales assume# under various administrations at various
periods.
But Mr. Finney is the sworn friend of officialdom, and
endeavors' to justify the ways of the Colonial Office to
the development of free institutions in the colony, when,
as matter of cold fact, everything worthy the name of jus-
tice and freedom was absolutely torn out of the maw of the
British lion by ex-convicts; in other words, by eman-
cipists. Free and high-bred officialdom fought against
all free institutions, and the British authorities upheld
them with a supercilious indifference to Australian eman-
cipist demands. Mr. Finney is always writing, however,
something in this strain The Imperial Government,
seeing that the time had now arrived to confer on the
colony, etc., etc.—whatever the mighty concession may
have been. The cessation of convict transportation was
largely won, in the teeth of the originally free and
bfenisoned “ pure merinos,” by the bulk of the emanci-
pated time-expirers—assisted by a mimber of brainy free
immigrants ; but that was late in the day. Granted, also,
that some renegade emancipists, like Wentworth, took
sides with the colony’s masters—the squatters.
f
“Barren ” is the word for this remarkable book “ pub-
lished by Authority” for the use of'children in State
schools. If the art of editing is the ability to leave out.
this i 3 one of the best-edited books in the world. The
chapters devoted to exploration appear to have been
written in a year of aggravated drought, for they are
nothing but arid wastes, damned with the abomination
of desolation and the gleaming bones of bleached names
and dates. Their aqpuracy is unimpeachable, lor one dry
sentence will embrace an aeon-agony of exploratory'
As'the book wanders from New South Wales it grows
more perfunctory, more “snippity”; but what is want-
ing in vivid and vital information is made up by masses
of isolated, and, consequently, uninstructive statistics.
When Maori land is reached this egregious history col-
lapses utterly. The glorious, many-coloured story of the
various native wars is dismissed with the curt dryness of
'a remainder biscuit; but some sapient remarks are made
about the “ constitution.” Mr. Finney can never pass a
constitution ” without having a tilt at it.
In conclusion, the historian “by Authority has
attempted too much. The history of Australasian mari-
time discovery should be treated b.v itself. The history
of the Early Governors and the Primal Gaol would make
another volume. But a school history of Australasia
should begin with the fight for the tardily-granted free
institutions, when emancipated convictism first saw the
dawn-blush pf a far-coming liberty.
The Passing Scribe.
Prof. Lounsbury discusses “ the split infinitive
in April Harper’s. He points out that to I “ €^ e
the infinitive is a usurper: it was originally the
sign of the gerund. Even now, after verbs such
as bid , make, let, hear, and others, we do not use
to. Why then should to be directly connected
with the infinitive: what dignity hedgesit? Louns-
bury affirms an increasing habit of shifting the
to to suit the emphasis, and refers to classic writers
as -‘splitting” unabashed. He finds one curious
example in Macaulay. The essay on Lord
Holland, as it appeared in The Edinburgh for
July, 1841, contained this sentence: “In order
fully to appreciate the character of Lord Holland,
it is necessary to go back into the history of his
family.” When Macaulay published his essays,
carefully revised, in 1843, he printed “to Why f-P"
preciate.’’ Lounsbury, having proved that the
charge of “ corruption of the language is ndt-
culous, comes to the conclusion that if ambiguity
be lessened or emphasis increased by. changing
the order of words in a sentence, no, arbitrary rule
against the change can stand.

Vignette opinions by Carlyle, from the newly-
published Letters —
Macaulay. —The sublime of the commonplace, not one
of whose ideas has the least tincture of greatness or
originality or any kind of superior merit except neatness
of expression. .
Thackeray.— There is a great deal of talent in him, a
great deal of sensibility—irritability, sensuality, vanity
without limit —and nothing or little but play-actorism to
guide it all with.
Buskin.— A bottle of beautiful soda-water.
The lust pin, at least, comes near to transfixing
gospel.
Edmund Gosse relates a conversation with Ten-
nyson. “The dunces fancy,’’ sard Tennyson to
Gosse in 1888. “it is the thought that makes
poetry live ;it is n’t, it’s the expression, the form;
but we mustn’t tell them so—-they would n’t know
what we meant.” The “dunces,” explains Gosse,
are people who trace similarities, and think that
a mediocre poet is more to be praised than a good
poet who succeeds him if the latter adds nothing
to the substance under treatment. Gosse reminded
Tennyson of the ritual of the Rosicru-
cians: “Our holy house, though a hundred thou-
sand men should have looked upon it, is yet
I destined to remain untouched, imperturbable, out
of sight, and unrevealed to the whole godless
world for ever.” Tennyson paused to listen, and
then beat bis walking-stick upon the gravel with
fervent approval. “Yes, yes!” he murmured,
“ that is the truth about the highest poetry ; it
may be popular, and praised in the magazines,
and yet the secret of it is 1 unrevealed to the whole
godless world for ever.’”
«—
Alix: In March English Illustrated Justin McCarthy
says of Mrs. Campbell Praed that “ she first: became
known to the reading world as the authoress of novels
which pictured with remarkakle vividness and artistic
completeness the life of various parts of Australia, and
indeed I think it would not be too much to say that
she created modern Australia for the novel-reading pub-
lic." Later he tells that Mrs. Praed “ left Australia
twenty years ago!” Mrs. Praed’s “creation" seems
to have had a curious effect upon McCarthy,
for he relates that he expected to find in her
“ a vigorous, energetic and rather effusive young woman,
loud and rapid of speech, expressive in word and action
of that wild and untrammelled life which I had come to
associate with the descendants of the earliest settlers on
the shores of Australian seas.” Why should the descen-
dants of the earliest settlers be supposed to lead a more
wild and untrammelled life than any other species of
Australian ?
When Swinburne and Rossetti were domiciled together,
quotes an English paper, Rossetti made a pun. Speaking
of Swinburne’s early amorous verses, he remarked, Of
course Swinburne is poeta nascitur, but unfortunately
non fit for publication.” One doubts the pun’s paternity.
H. S. Merriman’s Tomaso’s Fortune (Lond., Mac-
millan; 2s. 6 d.) exhibits his clean,_ clever method of
handling shorter stories. The work is readable, sugges-
tive, and evanescent.
M. : Yeend King says that standing one day in front of
Luke Fildes’ picture, The Doctor, he overheard two doc-
ters discussing what disease the patient was suffering
from. The more venerable affirmed croup, urging the
demeanour of the doctor and the fact that the time was
evidently the early morning, when croup sufferers are at
their worst. The younger man, after a little consulta-
tion, agreed. King asked Fildes if he had had any
especial malady in mind, and received the answer that he
had never given the question a thought. The story has
several obvious morals.
In. a Keats letter, recently sold in London for 261., the
poet wrote :—“ lam convinced that fine writing is, next
to fine doings, the top thing in the world. The ‘Paradise
Lost ’ becomes a great wonder.... I feel it in my power
to become a popular writer ; I feel it in my strength to
refuse the poisonous suffrage of a public... . The soul is
a world of itself, and has enough to do in its own home.
Professor Griffis, of Cornell (Amer.) University, says
that when he had spent some time “ among the sweet-
faced women” of Japan, “Caucasian women had tne
most cruel and repulsive appearance” to him. Utner
foreign residents in Japan have made a similar com-
ment : in fact, there is a quite respectable body of testi-
mony to justify Edwin Arnold’s infatuation.
Says Lond. Daily Chronicle of the other fellow’s
Browning— Edward Bowden’s: “The criticism, from
start to finish, is admirable. Avoiding every sort oi
I temptation—eschewing windy paraphrase and pretentious
grandiloquence—it moves straight to the heart of tne
poetrv, probing its intention and sifting its performance
with great exactitude and no little subtlety ofapprecia-
tion It is, in short, true literary criticism of the highest
order, making no attempt.to display its own cleverness
bv paradox or violence, but simply setting about its
business in a businesslike way, and performing its proper
task with high efficiency and by no means without
eloquence.” Aha !
In England, hy the way, they have recently erected a
tablet in Woodgates parish church to the first known
forefather of the poet Robert Browning, formerly
footman and butler to Sir John Banks of Corfe Castie.
Thus is the memory of Sir John Banks of Corfe Castle
perpetuated among men. As for Browning !

“He’s all here, what there is of him. He’s sound of limb, no bones
broken, and carries no superfluous flesh. He has as many ribs as
anyone—you can count them; and all he needs is a new supply of
Vitality, and that he can get from Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt.”
Give us a man who is Broken in Health, who is Nervous, whose Brain and Body are Weak, whose
Strength and Vitality, are Failing, who Sleeps Badly, Awakes More Tired than when he goes to Bed, who
is easily Discouraged, inclined to brood over imaginary troubles, who has Lost Energy and Ambition
to tackle hard problems, or who Lacks Animal Electricity, and in Less Than Three Months we will
Reorganise his entire Nervous System, Build Up where he is Broken Down, Invigorate his Circulation,
and pump his system full of New Life, New Energy, and New Vigor.
Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt
will do it for every Weak Man who has lost his power and strength, men who have allowed themselves
to go into decline through excesses and bad habits, causing a waste of the amount of Electricity Nature
gave them; and more, it will positively Cure All Pains or Aches, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Weak Back,
Sprains, and All Troubles of the Liver, Kidneys and Stomach. Marvellous results are obtained
where Ailments have been of fifteen and twenty years’ standing.
LUMBAGO AND DEBILITY.
MOEWELL, GIPPSLAND, VIO.
Gear Sirs, —I must state that your High-Grade Belt has been a great success in my case.
The pains in my back and legs have entirely disappeared. I can highly recommend your
Belt to every sufferer. —1 remain, yours faithfully, F. G. GRUNDY.

Skin'Tortured Babies
AND TIRED MOTHERS
find Comfort in Cuticura
Instant Relief and refreshing sleep for Skin-tortured Babies and
rest for Tired IMothers in warm baths with Cuticura Soap , and
gentle anointings with Cuticura Ointment, the great skin cure and
purest of emollients, to be followed in severe cases by mild doses of
Cuticura Resolvent Pills, to cool and cleanse the blood. This is
the purest, sweetest, most speedy, permanent, and economical treat-
ment for torturing, disfiguring, itching, burning, bleeding, scaly,
crusted, and pimply humours, eczemas, rashes, irritations, and
itchings, with loss of hair, of infants and children, yet compounded.
MILLIONS USE CUTICURA SOAP
Assisted by Cuticura Ointment, for preserving, purifying, and beautifying
the skin, for cleansing the scalp of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the
Stopping of falling hair, for softening, whitening, and soothing red, rough,
and sore hands, for baby rashes, itchings, and chafings, in the form of baths
for annoying irritations and inflammations, or too free or offensive perspira-
tion, in the form of washes for ulcerative weaknesses, and for many sanative,
antiseptic purposes which readily suggest themselves to women, especially
mothers, and for all the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery. No other
medicated soap ever compounded is to be compared with it for preserving,
purifying, and beautifying the skin, scalp, hair, and hands. No other
foreign or domestic toilet soap, however expensive, is to be compared with
it for all the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery. Thus it combines
in One Soap at One Price, the best skin and complexion soap, and the
BEST toilet and best baby soap in the world.
CUTICURA RESOLVENT PILLS
(Chocolate Coated) are a new, tasteless,
odourless, economical substitute for the cele-
brated liquid Cuticora Resolvent, as well as for all other blood purifiers and humour
Cures. Put up in screw-cap pocket vials, containing 60 doses.

Why not look
young ? There’s
genuine pleas-
ure in holding
back Father
Time fif-
\teen or
twenty
’years. You
can do it
A easily with
Ayer’s Hair
Vigor, for it
gives all that deep
and rich look to the
hair which belongs
to young life.
Ayer’s
Hair Vigor
You know the story—how good
Queen Bess, pointing to the beautiful
hair of a peasant girl, said, “ There’s a
real royal crown. I would trade my
golden one for it.” That was long ago.
Now you can have a “real royal crown”
of your own, simply by using Ayer’s
Hair Vigor. It makes the hair grow
thick and long and stops it falling
out.
When your hair is rich and heavy,
and when the closest inspection fails
to detect a single gray hair, you will
certainly look a great deal younger,
and you will be much better satisfied
with yourself, too. Isn’t that so ?

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My Sweetheart’s Eyes.
Fancy, clothed in colors brilliant,
Plays in retrospective mood
With the wraiths of fitful dead loves,
Misty shapes of womanhood,
Pictures fair of skies unclouded ;
Many lovers maidens woo
On the Parks, ’neath moon unshrouded.
Aye—my sweetheart’s eyes are blue.
Golden ringlets, kiss-curls waving
In the laughing seaward breeze,
Surges white the gunwale laving,
Boom awash in swelling seas.
Voice and hands and lips resisting,
Eyes, inviting, flash “You may ! ”
Cupid in the bows assisting.
Yes —my sweetheart’s eyes are grey.
Hail, the lure-lights of the city
Haunts of fleeing reckless bliss ;
Love, personified in Kitty,
Waits the nightly burning kiss.
Lips flushed blood-red, tresses raven
Coiled in dark majestic crown ; v
Conscience cries, in moments craven :
Yea—-my sweetheart’s eyes are brown !
Borrowed gold of ripened wheat-tops
Gives her orbs a passing sheen ;
Lustre caught from sunlit dewdrops
Lingers in her eyes serene.
Dark to blackness midst the bush mire,
Hazel on the open rise,
What care I for grey or sapphire ?
Love shines in my sweetheart’s eyes.

The Red Cedar.
Birds hold court within the branches
And the shadows of the cedar,
And tue trees, if trees have feelings, must regard it
As their sylvan lord and leader.
Daytime, lancing sunshine lights it,
And its blossoms cling and cluster,-
But, at night, it is the night’s heart, ’tis the dark
fold
Where the forest shadows muster. v-
Silent grows the bell-bird’s call-note,
Songless sit her fellows drooping,
As o’er dry leaves and o’er dead leaves to its shelter
Come the forest shadows trooping.
Not in vain they seek dark rest there,
Not in vain an thou wouldst heed it;
For a last use and a sad use hath the cedar
In the day when thou shalt need it.
Peace, the world may not imperil;
Sleep serene, by no means crowded,
Shall possess thee when it holds thee with thy shut
eyes
And thy body whitely shrouded.

I fill our glasses
With glowing wine,
For Night soon passes.
Lean your soft cheek, love,
Gently on mine—
Our hearts will speak, love.
We part to-morrow-
joy ever goes
In hand with Sorrow.
Your lips enthralling
Are like a rose
With petals falling.
So full of passion,
Yet blent with pain
In curious fashion.
Your warm hand presses,
And I in vain
Kiss lips and tresses.
Would I could hold you
For ever thus,
Till Death enfold you.
Would there were naught, dear,
But God and us,
And Love and Thought, dear.
Your eyes are star-lit,
And, like a rose,
Your lips flush scarlet.
But, linked with Sorrow,
Joy ever goes—
Ah, me ! — To-morrow I

On the Ranges.
Fern trees in the frosted gully drooping,
With the high clear morning blue o’erhead ;
Underneath, all green and grey the mosses,
Tangled bracken, twisted, brown and dead.
Fern trees by the roadside silent standing,
Robed in shining snowy bridal white 1 ,
Decked with gleaming, glittering diamond dew-
drops,
Scattered by the Fairies of the Night.
In this silent, still white world of Winter,
Never sound save waters’ whispering flow,
Broken, maybe, by the magpies’ carol
Where the tall gums catch the sunrise glow.
Fern trees waving where the long-horned cattle
Camp at night the leeside of the hill,
Where the rank dead native grass hangs over
Pools all ice-bound, motionless and still.
Soon are lost the few fair days of Winter,
Soon the Storm-King rules the land again,
While the gullies, hills, and plains are shrouded
In a weeping wreath of mist and rain.

Scepticism Thwarted.
Such Daily and Hourly Proof Must
Convince all Unbelievers.
The Cast of JAMES WINGFIELD.
(BY a SYDNEY 8CBIBB.)
What with the seven years’ drought, a re-
cnrrence of tho plague in our midst, and
lhocks of earthquake in various parts of the
country,it is high time that a definite policy
for purposes of personal defence should bo
dopted, and although thore are some
elements of disaster which cannot be re-
sisted, it is no reason why wo should not
make the most of tho opportunities at our
disposal for overcoming some of them.
Effective aid in tho shape of advice is given
below by Mr. James Wingfield, of Mo. 14
Garden Avenue, Glebe, who says :
“Whenl came from the country seven years
ago I was down for eighteen months with
inflammation of the lungs and pneumonia.
My constitution was fairly broken up, as for
nearly three years I was not able to do a
stroke of work, and, of course, that meant
everything going out and rot'iing coming
in. The consequence was that as toon as I
could get about at all I took the first job
available. The work was heavv—much too
heavy for me, in fact—so that what little
strength I had was soon exhausted ; but it
eras not until I severely strained my back
that, I realised the great risk I had been
running. - Following closely upon that mis-
hap, I caught a terrible cold in the kidneys,
which, in turn, was attended by an awful
attack of influenza, thus showing how one
misfortune follows another. I managed to
jog along in extreme difficulties until the in-
fluenza came, but that proved too much for
me altogether, as I went right under as
toon as it seized me.”
“ Was it necessary to tako to your bed ? ”
asked the pressman.
“ Rather/' The pains in my head were
so intense that I could not hold it up, and
my temperature rose to an alarming degree.
My back ached woree than ever, while my
limbs were so much affected in the same
way that I could not get any ease no matter
in what position I lay. Supervening upon
those tortures came a burning pain in my
eyes, over which I had two bandages placed,
and also one around my forehead, to see if
my agony could be reduced. I must have
looked as if I had been at the Boer war,
but I can tell you it was no laughing matter,
for 1 could neither eat nor sleep, and 1
deeply regretted to find that the cold was
getting on my chest, which became clogged
up during the night, and in the morning, as
soon as daylight came, 1 started to cough,
and a very heavy feeling oppressed me till
I got my chest cleared again. However, I
have to be very thankful that at the critical
moment, when there was every likelihood of
a prolonged and calamitous illness being
again experienced, 1 resorted to a medicine
which had previously enlisted my implicit
confidence, as, by its timely use, the im-
pending destruction was averted. To be
explict, I must tell you that after my ill-
ness with. pneumonia I took to using
Clements Tonic for the purpose of recuperat-
ing my vitality, and I met with so much
success through the revivifying powers of
that medicine that 1 naturally looked to it
to strengthen me again. But Clements
Tonic had a chance of doing more this time,
and it was quite equal to the occasion, you
see, when I was lying prostrate with in-
fluenza I did not waste much time before j
getting Clements Tonic, and thus that
dreadful complaint was held in check. My
excruciating head pains were very shortly
relieved, and the agonising manner in which
my eyes were affected wasgreatly minimised.
The wonderful relief I then felt through
tho agency of Clements Tonic helped me
along considerably, and as my strength was
gradually improving under the eame
remedy, so was there more vital power in
my system to fight against my adversities.”
“ You mean,” said the reporter, “ that
your disease made no further headway.”
Exactly,” was the enthusiastic reply.
"It was like a pitched battle between two
gladiators, and there is no doubt that
Clements Tonic won easily, as it prevented
the cold from getting a further hold upon
my chest, and the heaviness and difficulty
in breathing were entirely removed. I
used to think that Iliad lost control of my
nerves completely, because they trembled
so whenever anything happened to excite
me, and, besides, I got irritable at the least
thing. If I chanced to hear anybody
whistling or singing I felt annoyed, for it
seemed that everybody could bo
happy but myself, and that is a very
melancholy frame of mind to be in, believe
me. But the Clements Tonic I was taking
quickly held the upper hand over theso
troubles, for my nervous system was re-
stored to order, and the general sense of
ease and comfort which I was gaining had
the effect of making my mind more peaceful
and contented. The awful complication of
complaints from which I had suffered had
made such a wreck of me that I could not
get quite strong for some time, as, in the
meantime, I felt languid and drowsy all
day, and with my limbs for ever aching ;
but.it was a grand thing that Clements
Tonio had gone so far as to make me well
enough to go back to my work, although for
a while I felt very exhausted when I came
home at nights, and was always glad when
Sundays came round.”
“Were you resting better then than
before ! ”
“ Oh, yes. I found that Clements Tonio
was a fine medicine for making mo sleep,
and I was pleased to feel refreshed and
active when I woke up. because I had pre-
viously been put to such distress on getting
out of bed that I had to straighten myself
gradually on account of the pains in my
back, which at last yielded to the curative
properties of Clements Tonic, like the re3b
of the miseries which I had suffered from.
After a certain period my shattered con-
stitution was properly welded together
again, and whenever I have been asked how
it was done my friends have always received
the same reply— through using Clements
Tonic, and so long as I live it will be a
pleasure for me to advise all sufferers to
take the same medicine for curing thiir
complaints. Food had to be very tempt-
ing, and even then I could notalwaya touchife
before taking to Clements Tonic, but after-
wards I felt so hungry that I could take a fair
quantity of any kind of food, and thoroughly
enjoy it. Moreover, my digestive organs
were so benefited by the use of Clements
Tonic, that tho assimilation of my food
followed as a matter of course, and
I suppose that is one of the princi-
pal reasons why flatulence, headaches,
body pains, giddiness, and other physical
defects do not trouble me now.”
“ Have you any objection to this state-
ment being published ? ”
“ Not the slightest. You can publish
these words of gratitude to Clements
Tonic in any way you may prefer.”

Wonderful Home Treatment that Cures
Without Pain or Loss of Time.
Dr. W. S. Bice (Dept. 1317), 8 & 9, Stonecutter
Street, London, E.C., has invented a method that
cures rupture without pain, danger, operation, or
an hour’s loss of time from the day's work. To
Mb. A. Docherty.
avoid all questions of doubt, he
sends free to every sufferer a
free trial of his method, and
there can be no earthly reason
why anvone, rich or poor, should
not avail themselves of this
generous offer. As an instance
of this remarkable method,
the cure of Mr. J. J. Hogan,
Cobar, N.S.W., is well worth
noticing. He was cured at the
age of 70 years, after suffering
10 years. He made an affidavit
to this effect, of his own free
will, before two J.P’s.
Mr. J. Kubank, a farmer of Yarloop, Western
Australia, was cured after suffering 48 years from
a scrotal rupture. Mrs. F. Medley, 177, Sturt
Street, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia, was cured
after suffering 5 years. Mr. A.Docherty, 23, War-
wick Street, Birkenhead, Cheshire, England, was
cured of an irreducible scrotal rupture—one of the
worst kinds known. No treatment he had used
would enable him to return the rupture to its
proper place. He tried the method of Dr. Bice,
which not only reduced the rupture, but also
effected its complete cure, and he is now as sound
as a bell. A full description and sample'of this
remarkable method of cure will be gladly sent
upon application. It has cured thousands M Do not
hesitate to give it a trial. Write at once—to-day.

THE FEDERAL SITUATION.
As this issue goes to press the fragments of the
Coalition that didn’t happen are the principal
debris in the Federal arena. Presumably the
fragments may be put together again, but for the
present the subject of Coalition is somewhat in
abeyance. The whole idea and the whole negotia-
tion reflect discredit on everybody concerned.
George Reid held office in N.S.W. State Parlia-
ment for five years with a minority as regards his
own direct following—held it solely by the grace,
aid and countenance of the Labor party ; and he
tried his hardest to do the same thing in Federal
politics—would have done it, in fact, if the dis-
covery of his gross treachery hadn’t snapped the
negotiations carrot-fashion just when they were
nearly completed. Alfred Deakin held office on
similar terms in the Federal Parliament for
three years, and in all that time there was
only one hitch between him and his allies. The
Labor party, in each case, gave this support gratis.
It asked Reid and Deakin for no share of the
portfolios and salaries —for none of the loaves and
fishes. All it required was'the passing of measures
which it regarded as for the benefit of the country.
Seeing that it constituted half the Barton-Deakin
Government’s following, the Watson section of
the party had as much right to say that the pass-
ing of the Arbitration Bill was the price of its
support as the Mauger, Isaacs, and Chanter
section had to say that the Protective tariff was
its price. Watson parted from Deakin when the
latter “turned dog” on Arbitration, just as
Mauger and Chanter would have done if he had
“turned dog” on Protection.
* * * *
Nevertheless, just as soon as the third party
took possession of the loaves and fishes itself,
for the first time in 13 years, it was dis-
covered by the other two parties that third
parties were an invention of the devil, and that
“minority rule” was one of the seven deadly
sins. Then began a remarkable series of negotia-
tions, by which Reid was to join his deadly enemy
Deakin, and Deakin was to combine with hisvilifier
and traducer Reid, in order to show their joint
ingratitude to the party to which Reid owed all the
State Premiership he ever enjoyed, and to which
Deakin owed his resurrection from the oblivion
into which his luckless Coalition with Gillies sent
him 14 years ago. The proposed terms were that
each party was to sell its principles for
office. The Reid _ party professes to be-
lieve that the existing Protectionist tariff is
ruining the country, and it cordially agreed
to give up all attempts to save the country from
ruin during the term of this Parliament—provided
it got office. The Deakin party holds firmlv that
the tariff isn’t nearly so Protectionist as it should
be for the, good of the country, and it was pro-
posed that it should also pledge itself to give up
studying the good of the country—provided it got
office. There were the terms which the two
leaders arranged in secret caucus at Pumpkin
Smith’s hash-house, and the Freetrade party
accepted them enthusiastically. It made no secret
of the fact that it was ready to sell anything for
office. But William Lyne ably and manfully led
a revolt of the Protectionist party against the
degrading proposition—he had engineered the
revolt while his chief was surreptitiously engaged
in Pumpkin Smith’s hash -house-and the deal fell
through, at least for the time. The falling through
was accelerated by Deakin’s own refusal to take
office with his own proposed Coalition. Appar-
ently he felt he had drifted into an unfortunate
and degrading business, and wished himself out of
it
* * * *
The whole business was squalid and sordid t®
the last degree. The only grievance Deakin pro-
fessed to have against the Watson party was that
it wished to put the Arbitration Bill on the same
basis as when he and Barton originally drafted
the measure, and that it upheld an opinion which
presumably he and Barton also held—till they gave
it up at the remonstrance of Victorian State Premier
Irvine. The only grievance which Reid professed
was that the Watson party stood by an opinion
for which most of Reid’s own direct followers had
voted at Reid’s direct and public instigation.
Over this matter Deakin and George Turner
entered into negotiations with the crowd
which had lied about them and slandered
them over the Six Hatters incident, and which
had, almost in so many words, called them mur-
derers over the Petriana myth. And, with the
prospect of office in view, the other party was
perfectly willing to eat all those old lies. Also,
the Freetrade papers which had charged the
Deakin Government with crimes and offences
which, if these papers had believed their own
words, should have made all reconciliation im-
possible, were full of admiration for Deakin and
Turner as prospective rulers, in conjunction with
Reid. As for the sacred principles of Freetrade,
the Freetrade papers dropped them in the ash-
barrel with enthusiasm when the prospect of sup-
pressing the Democratic Watson Government
came in view. All this was supposed to be done
for the good of the country and for the
restoration of majority rule. And at the same
time Reid and Deakin were adjured to make
haste before the Watson Government gathered
strength. There was a dreadful fear lest the
Watson Government might do what the Tory
papers professed to want most of all, and restore
majority rule by presenting a programme that
would attract a majority, and Deakin and Reid
were urged in the name of majority rule to make
dead sure that Watson wouldn’t have a chance to
re-establish majority rule. All the Tory party
and the Tory press professed to be certain that
Watson’s programme would prove his hopeless
incapacity, and that his administration would
cover him with ridicule and disgrace—and at the
same time their anxiety that Watson shouldn’t
have a chance to show his incapacity and cover
himself with disgrace was pathetic in its intensity.
The whole attitude of the Tory party and the
Tory press was a disgrace to every principle of
political decency and ordinary fairplay.
* * * *
The proposed Coalition was also, among its
other virtues, to abolish the nefarious three party
system, but though that was to be the ostensible
reason of its existence everybody knew it would do
nothing of the kind. There would still be the
Deakin party, and the Reid party, and the Demo-
cratic party led by Watson— only the Deakin and
Reid parties were to work together until 1906,
after which date the old chaos was to supervene
once more. Also there would be, as everybody
knew, a fourth party, led probably by Lyne, con-
sisting of those Protectionists who refused to
coalesce. Consequently, for three years there
would be three parties—counting the ill-assorted
Reid-Deakin combination as one and at
the end of that time, when the temporary
two-headed monstrosity resolved itself once
more into its component parts, there would quite
possibly he four. The Coalition was also to
abolish “minority rule,” though, unless a large
number of politicians have been voting in shame-
ful opposition to their consciences—have been, in
short, liars and traitors—there never has been
minority rule. Certainly there was no majority
which had sold its conscience to the Deakin
Government and was prepared to swear that
everything that Government did was right, even
when it was wrong. Nor was there any visible
majority which was prepared to back Reid in any
political villainy, intrigue or degradation. But
unless some politician is able to prove that a
considerable number of politicians of whom he has
certain knowledge—probably acquired through
being one of the gang—have been sordid liars,
scoundrels and traitors, voting for sordid
reasons in support of things which they be-
lieved to be wrong, the majority has ruled
in every instance. Every measure since the Aus-
tralian Parliament began has been carried by a
majority vote, and if that isn’t majority rule what
is it ? Even assuming the alleged sordid wretches
who voted against their consciences and against
what they believed to be the country’s good—even
assuming them to exist, and assuming minority rule
to exist, the Coalition only proposed to make it
worse. On the first and most urgent issue, the party
which regards the tariff as extortionate and the
party which regards it as wholly insufficient were
both to be set aside, and the minority, of perhaps
half-a-dozen at most, which regards “the tariff as
quite satisfactory, was to run the show. So it was
in everything else. The majority was to prevail
in the sordid matter of grabbing the portfolios,
but in nothing else. And after all the Tory
denunciations of “caucus methods” the basis of
the new arrangement was to be the secret caucus
of Reid and Deakin at Pumpkin Smith’s assigna-
tion house—his political assignation house; then
the caucus of the two parties; then the joint
caucus. In fact, it was to be caucus all through.
For that matter, however, every political party
holds caucus meetings, and did so long before the
Labor party was heard of.
• e *
As a solemn matter of fact, it is absolutely neces-
sary to run Parliament with three parties, or
even more, if every man votes according to his
conscience. Of course, it is easier, and requires
less conscience, to have only the old two parties ;
the party that will do anything to get office and
the party that will do anything to keep office, but
the mere matter of ease and convenience isn’t the
only one to bo considered. Unless a House is always
divided into the “Ins” and the “Outs,” and no
question except the sordid one of being in or
being out is allowed to arise, no Legislature can
keep on the two party system. The theory
that there should be only two opinions in politics
—one being that the Leader of the Government
is always right, and the other that the Leader of
the Opposition is never wrong—is as silly as the
theory that there should only be one opinion on
religion. There are many immoral devices in
politics, but of them all the two party system is
the second worst, and the Coalition is the worst.
The Coalition is a device whereby two parties
which profess to hate all each other’s principles,
agree each to drop all the principles that the other
objects to. Gillies and Deakin did this years
ago in Victoria, and when they had dropped all
their principles to please each other, there was
nothing left for them to do except borrow money,
They had to do something to fill in time, so they
borrowed money. And with the monev thev built
hopeless cockspur railways to fill in" time, and
made a demented boom, and an appalling
burst, and filled the land with ruin and miserv.
It took years to disinter Alfred Deakin’s
reputation from under the ruins, and he
ought to know better than to repeat the experi-
ment- . I) eakin has no luck in the way of
Coalitions. He began his political career by
selling himself to a Tory without hair or prin-
ciples, and he nearly ended it last week by selling
himself to a Tory without grace, dignity or brains.
* * * *
Meanwhile the Watson Government has
announced its programme, and that is a serious
blow to the Coalition movement. It is so fair
a programme that those who lately denounced
Premier Watson as an incendiary now denounce
him because he doesn’t propose to burn, slay or
confiscate anything. They complain that the new
Premier isn’t living up to the ruinous and
disastrous policy which the Tory faction
alleged that he possessed. They lament, in short,
that he is the real Watson, the Watson he
has always been—a capable, prompt, level-headed
politician ; and that by being himself he meanly
puts in a Hole those lying papers and persons that
always explained to the public how the first
Democratic Government would take office with a
flaming torch in one hand, and a gory dagger in
the other, and a newly-severed head trailing behind
it at the end of a bit of string. Watson, in fact,
has deserted the imaginary principles that the
Argus invented for him, and the Argus and
its clan want to throw him out for not being
horrible enough. And after preaching of the
Watson party as the apostles of class legis-
lation Toryism in general complains that these
alleged class legislators have meanly concealed
themselves behind a policy that has hardly
a sign of class legislation about it. Most of the
things the new Government proposes doing are
things that the old Government either tried to
do but didn’t accomplish, or things that the
old Government approved of in a general way but
admitted itself too weak or too tired to seriously
attempt. Probably the bitterest grievance against
the Watson Ministry is that it proposes to provide
old age pensions for all Australia and has
devised a fairly promising means of raising
the necessary funds without additional taxa-
tion. At least the means a Government
tobacco monopoly in the manufacturing and
wholesale branches of the trade —has been tried
and proved workable and highly profitable in Italy,
France, Japan, Spain and other countries, and if
the Tory party can get over its deep-rooted im-
pression that an Australian is naturally more in-
capable than a Spaniard it may allow the experi-
ment to be tried here also. The Watson party is
the only one which has any scheme for
providing old age pensions, though both the
other parties are full of hazy and general ap-
proval of this humane idea. Now the other parties
are still scheming more or less vigorously to drive
Watson out of office and prevent him providing
the old age pensions which they hazily approve.
The Coalition, if it comes to pass, has at least a
name ready for it. It will be known as the Society
for the Prevention of Food to the Aged.
PREMIER WATSON ON BANKING.
Evert time any proposal is made to improve the
woefully clumsy and costly banking system of
Australia (generally by some approach to the
Canadian method) the financial column of Sydney
Telegraph, which is the chief opponent of all
change, utters a pathetic moan to the effect that
the idea of doing anything at all is too dreadful to
be contemplated. Every movement has to en-
counter the obstruction of petrified things like the
Telegraph, which hold that to be absolutely
motionless, inert, and stationary is the secret of
all true greatness. But in this particular matter
the paper always flies off its head, and is ignorant
and puerile, even beyond the average. The
Australian banking system is neither English,
Scotch, nor anything else in particular; it is
only clumsy, expensive, and accidental. It is
practically regulated by no laws at all. It involves
the constant retention of the ridiculously large
sum of about £20,000,000 in coin, and seeing that
Australia owes about £200,000,000 abroad in public
debt alone, this represents £20,000,000 of borrowed
money lying idle, and costing Australia some
£BOO,OOO a year in interest. This £20,000,000 or so is
the average balance whi ch is always stationary in the
country, which is never sent away for any purpose
whatever, and which costs £BOO,OOO a year interest
for merely lying around. In Canada the banks
are compelled to hold at least 40 per cent, of their
cash reserves in State notes, which system, if
applied in Australia, would mean that about
£8,000,000 of paper money would lie idle, or only
move from one part of the country to another, in
place of £8,000,000 of coin, and that the gold lying
idle or only changing its location a little in
the country would be only £12,000,000. On
this subject the Sydney Telegraph recently
lamented in the following regrettable fashion: —
The Canadian precedent is wholly inapplicable to Aus-
tralia. Take the following comparison :
Canada. ...Australia.
Note circulation ..£11,200,000 £3,250,000
Coin and bullion .. 2,500,000 18,200,000
Government notes .. 4,800,000 (Queensland) 600,000
Money at call in U.S.
and London.. .. 9,300,000
In Canada notes are free of duty, and the great bulk of
the cash reserves are held in New York and Chicago,
withdrawable at a day’s notice, but earning interest. Our
banks have no New York in which to deposit money at
call, where it would be available in 24 hours. The Com-
monwealth now says : “I will take 40 per cent, of your
gold, or £7,300,000, and compel you to take my notes in
exchange. Of that £7,300,000, I will sink £5,100,000, in
the Federal capital and public works.” The coin in the
banks would be reduced to under £11,000,000 and that has
to stand the strain not only of internal circulation, hut
constant withdrawals for export, for which Government
notes would be no good. It would be no use for the
banks to attempt to circulate the Government notes ; they
would be compelled to holcWO per cent, all the same, and
lock them up for all time, and it would cost the banks
£200,000 a year to hold them. If the Federal Parliament
passed such a law, it would be incumbent on the banks to
remove as much of their coin reserves as possible to a
great distance, and £10,000,000 held in Maoriland would
reduce the Commonwealth 40 per cent, very materially.
Otherwise we should have a scare.
* * * *
In Canada, it seems, the system works so
well that the banks, though compelled to keep
only 40 per cent, of their local cash reserves
in State notes, actually keep over 66 per cent. If
it paid as well in Australia there would be nothing
to complain of. But the special childishness of the
Telegraph’s yarn lies in two statements. The
first is the very silly and crude complaint that
the £11,000,000 of coin left in the hands of the
banks would have to “ stand the strain of internal
circulation. ” For internal circulation purposes the
banks would be able to pay out Government notes
and gold, so long as they kept in hand £4 in notes
for each £6 in com. They would have j ust as much
money available for internal circulation as thev
have now. Also the £11,000,000 or so of golcl
wouldn’t require to stand the strain of “constant
withdrawals for export” any more than the
£18,000,000 or £20,000,000 of gold has to do now ;
the fact that this amount of coin remains on hand
almost constantly, in good years and bad, shows
that it doesn’t stand the strain; the export of gold
is covered by the new output of the mines. But
the most outrageously foolish yarn of all is to the
effect that to keep £8,000,000 of paper lying idle
or circuiting internally instead of £8,000,000 of
gold would cost the banks £200,000 a year.”
How it would cost the banks any less to
have gold lying idle and earning nothing
instead of paper, or cost any more to pay out £6
a - nd £4 , P, a P er for local Purposes instead
of £lO m gold, the Telegraph wisely doesn’t
attempt to explain. The writer has interviewed
three bank managers on the point, and they can’t
explain either. They merely suggested that
perhaps the Telegraph was talking in an amateur
sort of way, or perhaps it was liable to have fits
like that whenever the Watson Government was
concerned. The statement that the banks couldn’t
circulate the Government paper because they
must still keep 40 per cent, in hand is also one that
the three bank managers gave up as a bad job If
a bank had £1,000,000 cash reserve it would natu-
rally, under the proposed system, have £4OO 000
paper and £600,000 coin. If it paid awav half of
this, it would pay away £200,000 in paper and
£300,000 in coin, and still hold 40 per cent, of
its cash reserves in paper. And if it didn’t pay
away anything, it would keep both the gold and
the paper lying idle, and one would be as heavy a
loss as the other. That position ought to be simple
enough for any paper’s comprehension.
AFTER THE LAST BOOM HARVEST.
There are only two ways by which Australia
can earn its bread and cheese. It can do it by
working the “great natural resources of the
country,” growing wool and wheat to'sell at the
other end of the earth, and getting in return
manufactured goods; or it may manufacture for
itself the things it needs, even if it has to grow
for a while less wool and wheat. The foreign-
trader says that this country wasn’t intended for
manufacturing purposes; presumably he holds
that the vast quantities of coal and iron and other
raw products, now either not worked at all or only
to a limited extent, were dropped here by acci-
dent. He says _ that Australia’s business—the
business for which it was obviously designed
in the scheme of things —is to grow
wool and wheat, and leave the rest to
others. When a drought occurs, or grasshoppers,
or rabbits, or red rust, or fluke, or tick, and the
wool clip and wheat harvests are a frost, he lays
low, and fills in time talking about “ the return of
prosperity,” and demanding State bonuses of all
sorts for the men whom he has induced to go into
a business which can’t support itself. But when
the usual things forget to happen to the “great
natural industries,” and a phenomenally good
season is reported, the old yell of “On to the
land !” is heard again. Last season one of these
rare accidents happened, and New South Wales
reaped a remarkable wheat harvest averaging 19
bushels, and the wool and sheep country also had
a good time. Then the men who had been crawling
to the Government for aid for the wheat-farmer
and wool-grower began to refer again to these as
“the backbone of the country,” and to refer to
their callings as the “great natural industries’’;
and the Foreign-trade papers were sure that the
19-bushel harvest clearly showed what the State’s
natural and proper business is. In these circum-
stances it is just as well to dig into the past
and see what has already happened. In 1890
there was just such a season as N:S. Wales has
now had. The previous year, 1889, had been
disastrous; the wheat yield averaged only 475
bushels. The next followed with 15 - 65 bushels;
and, as on the present occasion, it seemed bigger
than it really was by reason of the contrast. In
the pastoral country there were almost identical
conditions to those of the past 12 months. Also
just the same vague inanities followed about our
resources, and our manifest destiny; just the
same demands that we should “ encourage settle-
ment on the soil ” and forget all about our need of
factories; just the same rush for country. The
land revenue jumped ; and this list, showing the
receipts from various sources, is the history of
what followed :

The figures for 1895 are for the half-year; the
financial year was then altered to end on June
30th. In addition to the amounts shown as
received in 1903, £77,782 was collected condition-
ally under the Western Lands Act. Altogether
the list forms an awful record of the disappoint-
ment and disaster which followed that former
boom in land settlement in the remote parts
—the only parts where land was available
except at extortionate rentals. There is a
volume of tragedy in the reduction of pastoral
rents from £447,656 to (say) £125,000, allowing for
the payments to the Western Land Board. That
reduction means scores of holdings abandoned,
after a desperate struggle in which the lessees lost
every pound they owned ; it means, in other
cases, that the State has cut down the rent by half,
it having been proved absolutely impossible for
the men, no matter how they might starve them-
selves and their families, to pay on the old absurd
basis—just such another basis as we are at the
E resent moment building upon. The slump in
omestead-lease rents shows that the small man
has suffered in the same way. Payments on con-
ditional leases have been fairly well maintained,
partly through the holders being able to pawn
their conditionally-purchased holdings, and partly
because most of these holdings are not so far from
the coast. On the other hand, the great slump in
conditional-purchase deposits, notwithstanding the
enormous amount of borrowed money spent in
opening up country for selection in this form,
shows what little land that looks suitable for
selection in ordinary seasons has been available.
More may look suitable for selection just now,
with the glamor of the 19-bushel harvest upon it;
but what will happen in the ordinary season ?
And it ought to be remembered that, prior to
1902, the seasons for several years had been better
than ordinary. How disastrous was the booming
of the “ great natural industries” on the text of
the 1890 harvest and clip the foregoing figures
partly show; and it is just as certain as anything
can be that, unless the coastal lands are forced
open, the rush of settlement in consequence of the
1903 harvest will end in exactly the same way.
And even if the coastal lands are forced into use it
is extremely doubtful whether the settlers will be
much better off so long as they have to depend
upon a market 15,000 miles away.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Federal Capital.
The proposal of the Watson Government to fix
the area of the Federal capital territory at 900
square miles is an example of almost painful
moderation ; though some consolation lies in
the thought that even if this inadequate area
serves as a compromise for the present it may
be greatly enlarged at some future date. The
Constitution provides for the taking of any area,
no matter how large, but it decrees that the
territory must not be less than 100 square miles.
The ideal Federal territory needs to be large
enough to contain the Federal city and its
suburbs in the first place. Then it should con-
tain a catchment area that will supply the Federal
capital with abundant water; if the catchment
lies outside the Federal territory the city will be
at the mercy of a possibly hostile and probably
indifferent State authority for the. preservation
and purity of its water supply. Sydney requires
an area of 354 square miles to furnish
it with water, and even this space, which is
times larger than the ridiculous minimum to which
a certain clique in Sydney wants to restrict the
Federal territory, has been found insufficient.
Further, the Federal territory should be of such a
size that the increase in land values created by the
expenditure of the public money on the building
of a capital shall be all, or nearly all, inside that
area and be retained as the property of the people ;
Australia doesn’t want to spend its money to
enhance the value of the properties of private
landlords in N.S.W., or victoria, or anywhere
else, and to enable them to screw larger rents out
of their tenants. The territory should not be
surrounded by any one State, and thus liable to
be some day wholly dependent for railway and
road communication on a frantically anti-Federal
State Premier like John Haynes, or one like
Bruce Smith, who regards the Commonwealth
Government as accursed because it won’t fill the
land with Chinese. And the Federal territory
should have its own port if possible—though on the
basis of 900 square miles this seems very unlikely
at present. Of course, even Premier Watson’s
exceedingly mild proposal is far in excess
of the ideas of the small but vociferous anti-
Federal clique in Sydney. Its idea is a
Federal territory of 100 square miles (10 miles
each way), surrounded by the lands of
N.S.W., dependent wholly on the forbearance of
the N.S.W. State Government for road and rail-
way communication and water supply, drawing
all its food supplies from N.S. W., so situated that
all its trade must go to Sydney, and creating, by
the expenditure of the money of all Australia, an
immense increase in N.S.W. land values. A Iso
the attitude of this clique is that it is the indubit-
able right of N.S.W. to have the capital, and,
consequently, to surrender the requisite territory;
that tnere is a base conspiracy on foot to prevent
N.S.W. having the capital, and, consequently,
surrendering the requisite territory; that
N.S.W.’s magnanimity in surrendering the
territory isn’t sufficiently recognised; that
N.S.W. should only surrender what ter-
ritory it pleases and where it pleases, and
should have the sole right to fix the site of the
capital of all Australia ; that there is a shameful
conspiracy afoot to take territory from N.S.W. ;
that the N.S.W. State Government should block
the selection of a capital till it gets its own way
as to site, area and everything else; and that if
the capital isn’t selected immediately it will show
that ‘ ‘ Victorian influences ” aro again at work.
Barring these few difficulties Premier Watson
has no troubles worth speaking of to contend with
in this matter.
♦
The Victorian State Labor Party.
One of the motives which prompted Deakin to go,
with disinfectants in his shoes and his political
reputation in his hands, to talk coalition with Reid
was that he was discouraged from talking coalition
with the Labor party by the fear that that party
would not be able to enforce any union of purpose
at a general election. He might come to an agree-
ment on Radical lines with the Parliamentary
Labor party, and he and his followers, at the
first electoral appeal, might find themselves op-
posed by Labor candidates—not sanctioned by the
Parliamentary party, but by the outside Labor
leagues. There is something in the contention.
The Labor party more than any other party has
its Parliamentary and its eleqtoral organisations
dissociated; it is more difficult in the affairs of
that party than of any other to bind the outside
leagues with the word of the inside members.
Still there have been instances to show that it is
not impossible. When Reid in N.S.W. went to
the country to seek a mandate to end or mend the
Upper House (which mandate was given but
never enforced) he went in alliance with the Labor
party, and an almost absolutely harmonious electo-
ral campaign was carried through to a successful
issue. Again, to give another sort of instance,
when in N.S.W. the outside personalities in the
Labor leagues—led by Hughes and Holman,
who now both know better—sought to attack
the Parliamentary Labor Party and force on
it an impossible form of pledge, the result of a
bitter struggle was in favor of the Parliamentary
party. That lesson will probably prevent in the
future any attempt by the “outside” men to
unfairly control the inside men. It is possible for
the Parliamentary Labor party to bind the Political
Labor leagues on a fair issue, and such a bond
would be recognised by all except a few irrecon-
cilables. That is a fact, but it is not easy to believe
it to be a fact in Victoria just now when, the
pressing political duty being the destruction
of Bent, the Labor party is carrying on a foolish
cut-throat campaign which serves the interests of
the enemy. Against Bent there is the Labor party
and the “Liberal party” led by Mackinnon.
Obviously the tactics of the Labor party should oe
to help Mackinnon, or rather to let Mackinnon
help it. ButitattacksMACKiNNON with just as much
vehemence as Bent, and in many constituencies
by setting up a three-cornered fight makes the
return of the Bent candidate almost certain.
That is bod politics, bad in its immediate results
in Victoria, bad in its indirect effect on Australian
affairs. The Labor party has come to the point
in Australia when it must cease to be merely a
party of incoherent protest. It has a policy, and
it must show itself ready to administer that policy.
An increasing number of electors each poll turn
to the Labor party as the organisation holding out
the most hope for relief from the worn-out shibbo-
leths and the tired aims of older parties. The
Labor party must justify the confidence which in
a sense is forced upon it, or give way to some other
organisation. An Ishmael policy will not serve
in practical politics. The Labor party, to be suc-
cessful, must be ready to offer and accept—and to
loyally observe—alliances.

Philp’s Fables.
Ex-Premier Philp the alleged business man — in
his capacity as leader of the Queensland Oppo-
sition, recently visited the northern parts of the
State and exposed his ignorance and incapacity on
many platforms. But it was at Charters lowers,
when holding forth over a glass of. wine to a com-
Sany of importers and other reactionaries, that. he
naily unburdened himself and put the coping
stone on his reputation as. an ill-informed, preju-
diced and incapable politician. Compulsory Arbi-
tration was the subject on which he mostly let
himself bolt, and his fables were principally as
follows :
Mutual agreement was better than going before a judge.
. . . One side, when law was resorted to, always was
satisfied it had not received justice and bad feeling was
bred. . . . Arbitration was not an unqualified success in
Maoriland or N.S.W. In N.S.W. both employers and
employees were sorry they had it. . . . The court had 15
months work ahead and both sides would like to cry
truce. . . . Employers got out of the Act by paying
daily wages and had no trouble. . . . Men did not like it.
Employers thus dodged the court, etc., etc.
Peiilp, who ought to know but apparently doesn t,
forgot, or dishonestly refused to mention, that the
N.S.W. Act recognises that mutual agreement is
better than judgment, and consequently provides
for conciliation and the drawing up of agreements
satisfactory to both parties, and that many such
mutual agreements have been made and are work-
ing well. As to “dissatisfaction,” a burglar or
cronk bank director, as well as a sweating em-
ployer or rapacious employee, is always dissatisfied
when Justice hands him down a sentence of seven
years, and bad feeling against the law is thus en-
fendered. Still, only anarchists like Philp and his
loodle party, or the criminal classes themselves,
want to destroy the Law and destroy Judges.
Arbitration is not an unqualified success. Well,
neither were the banks that broke in ’93, nor the
Continuous Government. But no sane man asked
the people of Queensland to abolish Governments
and banks rather than amend or perfect them.
Only anarchists and silly Tories of the Philp
party talk of destroying a thing because it isn’t
perfect. Anyhow, Queensland isn’t sorry it has a
Government, even though the Morgan Ministry
may not be an unqualified success. It is an im-
provement on the Philp affair, and can be
bettered. So can everything else in this world.
The N.S.W. Arbitration Court, according to
Philp, has 15 months work ahead. Well, the
Morgan and future Queensland Ministries have
possibly 15 years work ahead straightening up the
administrative, legislative and financial muddle
created by the Philp-Leahy-Nelson party. Still
Queensland isn’t going to fling Morgan out on his
ear and refuse to have any legislation at all on
that account, and neither will Maoriland nor
N.S.W. abolish Arbitration because past condi-
tions have caused an accumulation of injustices
that require 15 months to arrange. Accord-
ing to Philp, N.S.W. employers easily dodge
the Act, and have no trouble. If the Act
is so easily dodged, how is it that the
court is so full of work, and why are the
employers so aggravated at the existence of a
law which, being easily dodged, doesn’t affect
them ? Finally Philp assured his audience that
“the London scare was caused by Labor
speeches.” Yet London is much more scared
of Turkish securities than of Australian ones, and
in Turkey the man who makes Labor speeches
disappears and remains that way, and Abdul
Hamid attends to all necessary Arbitration
himself. London, as a matter of fact, heard that
Piiilp and Go. had accumulated, in proportion to
population, the biggest debt on earth. It heard
of the Philp deficits, the Philp helplessness and
hopelessness, the refusal of Philp to raise suffi-
cient taxation to make its interest safe—and
London grew alarmed. It is the silly, childish
boast of Philp and his kind that they are so
perfect, so wise, so solvent, and in such good
repute, that London would lend anything they
asked for so long as it was sure they would remain
in office ; and that nothing save the downfall of
that brightest gem in the world’s aggregate
intellect, Philp, could have stopped the rush of
loans. And yet a man’s political IO U and his
personal lOU must have some relation to each
other. Has Philp been such a gorgeous success
in any walk of life that his mere presence at the
head of the Government is a sufficient guarantee
of solvency ? How many banks sit on his
doorstep urging him to take a £lO,OOO overdraft on
his own personal security ?
The Rail and Tram Slaughter.
The increasing length of the “ butchers’ bill ” of
the N.S.W. railways is startling. The “Statis-
tical Register” gives the figures for 10 years
past: —
Tramways Railways
r x ✓ *"'■ " i
Killed Injured Killed Injured.
1894 .... 7 9 28 144
1895 .. ..5 21 42 160
1896 .. .. 9 22 25 118
1897 .... 9 9 25 135
1898 .... 9 6 29 112
1899 .... 7 3 23 120
1900 .. .. 26 202 36 255
1901 .. ..25 191 46 441
1902 .. .. 32 545 34 822
1903 .. .. 37 594 42 808
The increase under the heading of tramways
is obviously due to the gradual substitution of
electric traction for steam, coupled with the
extension of the system. But while the length of
line has been rather more than doubled in 10 years,
fatal tramway accidents have been multiplied by
five and non-fatal by 50. Some increase was ex-
pected ; N.S.W. knew it would have to pay some
price fijr the improved facilities. But it is getting
close up to the point of paying one life a week
besides breaking up two people a day, and that is
a heavy bill, which it takes a lot of facilities to
justify. Certainly the citizens may be as much to
blame as the system. If they knew the size of the
bill they might take a little more care not to add
to it themselves. If they realised that the tram-
ways are rushing after two victims a day they
would probably take fewer risks. The railway
figures show no remarkable increase in the number
of killed, but achieve something striking in the
matter of injured. Ten years ago the latter num-
bered 7'5 per million of passengers carried. Last
year they numbered 25 '2 per million. On the
basis of mileage run, the comparison, so far as
employees only are concerned, was worse. One
employee was injured for every 77,100 miles run
in 1894; now the proportion is one for every
15,700 miles. Besides showing an enormous
increase, the present rate appears to be about the
highest in the world. Adding Coghlan’s figures to
those given by Mulhall, these results are shown:
Injured Per Million Passengers.
Norway .. .. 3'o United Kingdom 7 - 2
Holland .. .. 4'2 Denmark .. 7‘4
France .. 4’6 Switzerland .. 9 - 0
Germany .. 5'7 Portugal .. 10‘3
Sweden . . 71 N.S. Wales .. 25'2
Ten years ago the N.S.W. figures were fair; to-
day they are appalling, and demand an explana-
tion. Either the management of the railways is
shockingly bad, or the railways themselves have
been allowed to drift into a dangerous state of
disrepair, or mishaps are regarded as injuries in
N.S.W. which are not so regarded elsewhere. Even
if the last alternative is accepted, the fact of the
enormous increase has still to be explained. The
figures, at any rate, are so startling that they call
for an official inquiry into the whole subject.
A Milk Issue.
N.S.W. Supreme Court seems to have joined the
Deform party, judging by the violence of its
attacks on the present Government over the
“milk case” —a new rival of the Friedman case
in its ingeniously raised false issues. The facts of
the milk case are that N.S.W. Board of Health,
after some inquiry, decided to _ forbid the use of
boracic acid as a preservative in milk. There is
some scientific controversy as to the harm or
otherwise of the practice; in The Bulletin’s
opinion the use of the preservative is
condemnable, not merely because the supply
of a partly poisonous drug, even in minute
quantities, to infants in their daily is
undesirable, but also because preservative drugs
serve to disguise uncleanliness. One milk co.
engaged in making “concentrated milk” ob-
jected to the Board of Health bye-law, and thus
raised another question—whether a prohibition
which applied to fresh milk should be extended
also to a preserved milk in which a very small
proportion of boracic acid was used in place
of sugar as a preservative. Presuming that
“ concentrated milk ” is intended for con-
sumption only when fresh milk is unobtainable
it might with some reason plead for an exemption.
But it is not stated that concentrated milk does
confine itself to that sort of trade. The Board of
Health, anyhow, refused to make any difference in
its regulations for concentrated milk, and there
began a prolonged and somewhat sordid squabble.
It was suggested, on behalf of the Concentrated
Milk Co., that certain persons “having influ-
ence ” with the Board of Health and the Muni-
cipal Council were shareholders in Sydney milk
co.’s which were interested in killing the con-
centrated milk business. This was brought
forward as a bye-issue to support a con-
tention, which several doctors agreed with—
that the amount of boracic acid in the
concentrated milk was absolutely innocuous.
However, the concentrated milk people were
prosecuted and fined. They appealed to the
Executive (which was, at the instance of the
Board of Health, the author of the boracic acid
bye-law and might have repealed it at any time),
pointing out that a business in which they had
sunk £30,000 was at stake, since concentrated milk
could not be manufactured without the use of
boracic acid. The Cabinet referred the matter
to a select committee of Parliament, and
gave instructions that the fine imposed on the
C.M. Co. was not to be enforced pending that
inquiry. This procedure was absolutely legal, had
been followed for a score of years by successive
Governments, and amounted to a stay of proceed-
ings pending appeal. Since it was a bye-law and not
a law which was in question, and this bye-law could
be repealed, just as it was created, by the Cabinet,
the Cabinet was the proper court of appeal, and
the Cabinet, to assist it in coming to a decision,
had a right to appoint a Parliamentary Select
Committee. The committee was appointed, and
reported in favor of the Concentrated Milk Co. (the
constitution of the committee was such that this
decision did not inspire as much confidence as
would have been won by the judgment of a more
representative body), but the Cabinet finally
decided to ignore the decision of the committee
and enforce the Board of Health regulation.
Meanwhile the Sydney City Council, acting
unreasonably and probably with an eye to
helping the Deform Party, invoked the Supreme
Court to enforce with imprisonment the payment
of the fine which had been suspended, poured out
a mass of allegation against the Government for
“ interfering with the course of justice,” and the
Supreme Court, it is to be sincerely regretted, fell
in with the attack, and from the Bench “ slated ”
the Government for a course which was absolutely
legal, had the warrant of many precedents, and
was not only just, but a necessary step against a
possible injustice. To add a humorous feature to
the milk case, some members of the Labor party
—which has an uneasy consciousness of the fool it
has made of itself in backing up the long course
of wild borrowing and prodigal expenditure on
the part of the Government —conceived the
idea that this would be a good issue on
which to part company with See; one caucus
meeting has already discussed the position, and
another is to follow. The N.S.W. Labor party
unblushingly backed up for five long scandalous
years the financial and other maladministration of
Reid, and then threw him out with a bang because
he had given twopence or so out of the Treasury
to Jawbone Neild without full warrant. If now,
having approved of all the extravagance, the
muddling, and the borrowing of the See-Owe-
Sullivan Government, it gives as a reason for
secession this milk business, it will establish itself
as having an incurable habit of looking at the
twopenny side instead of the £1,000,000 side of
national affairs.
The Battering of a Coalition.
From the Federal gallery :
How the first Coalition project came to fail through is
a simple enough 'story. The solid Protectionist party
stood between Alfred Deakin and himself. From the
time he decided to enter the Coalition negotiations his
followers determined on that course because they knew
Deakin’s weakness in self-effacement. Practically the
caucus discussed no other point. There was no other point
to discuss. The complete surrender of the REiD-ites on
policy left no escape. The difference was that the policy
was to be in the hands of a man whom few members trusted
instead of in the hands of one whom all trusted. From
that neither Isaacs, nor Turner, nor Bonython, nor
Keating would budge. Turner and Isaacs said bluntly
that they wanted Deakin, and that if he stood out they
stood out. The only Victorian who would take office was
Allan M‘Lean, of Gippsland, who is anti-White Australia in
his sympathies. Bonytiion said that his State was either
Deakin or direct Labor. Keating said the same : “We
have broken the REiD-ites to pieces in Tasmania. To
what purpose if Reid is now to come to power ? With us,
too, it is Deakin or direct Labor.”
The best of the Federal situation is that the Labor
party is active. With Deakin available, either in front or
behind, it is time it was. But the Victorian situation
is in the way when Victorians are dealt with. Tom Mann
goes in and out blackguarding men who worked hard for
Labor when he was following a lazy man’s job in London.
The burden of his Labor addresses in the face of Bentism
is not Bent, ill-looking and ill-doing as he is, nauseous
in his private and public life, but, as Deakin
put it, “the men nearest are the men who are stabbed.”
The danger of a Labor split is wholly in Victoria, and it is
just Victoria which Watson does not seem able to con-
trol. With a combination of Deakin and Watson every
Victorian seat but Kooyong would be won, and, with a
good man, Knox would be downed. With Labor cutting
in and making it a three-cornered fight—Labor, Liberal,
and Tory—nearly every Vic. seat goes Tory. The Deakin-
ites must either swing Tory or Labor. They are holding
out to go Labor, but they will not go until the Tom Mann
lot are brought to heel. They doubt whether the lot can
be brought to heel. Once dispel that doubt, and the
trouble is over. The sympathies of Deakin are all with
Watson?
It is no use blinking the fact that there is a chance of
George Reid carrying his no-confidence motion. As the
lines are now drawn there are men who will vote for his
motion—men like M'Goll, Salmon, and M‘Cay, who have
no intention of staying with him. Their electors have
pledged them against Labor, as Victorians know it. They
are pledged against Tom Mann, and against Bung, who is
patronising the Labor movement in Victoria, and growing
iat on it. They are not pledged against Watson or
Hughes or Batchelor,
It was a good thing that Reid spoke in the Reps, on
Friday. He may not have lost votes, but he slipped back.
Reid in a conciliatory mood is like Bent talking religion,
or the Devil in the confessional. For three hours he
wandered on, trying to undo what he was doing. He
built up one moment, and regretted it the next. His
handiwork displeased him because everywhere it was out
of plumb, and rocky. He was talking on a policy he
knew nothing about, or was at enmity with. So he
wandered on. “ I will finish in five minutes,” he pleaded,
and went on for half-an-hour, because the knobs were
sticking out all round his speech, and he wanted to pare
them down. He kept the lunch hour waiting to try and
finish, and, after waiting fifteen minutes, Page jumped up
in disgust and went out. Others followed. “ I will only
be a few minutes,” he pleaded, but members were dis-
gusted, and more went out. “ All right,” he cried, “ I’ll
finish after lunch.”
Reid went back. Hughes went right forward. What
a great thing it was to hear the fine, nervous English of
the Minister for External Affairs ! Reid’s pose as an angel
of light was but a ragged magpie when Hughes finished
with him. It was a sad pity that Webster towards the
end gave Reid a chance to walk out in high indignation.
Had Reid sat opposite Hughes another ten minutes
there would have been such a flare of temper as would
have enlightened the Commonw'ealth to the kind of man
wanting to come to power. The test of a speech is the
extent to which a man does what he sets out to do.
Hughes set out to destroy Reid as a menace to the Labor
members and the DEAKiN-ites. He did so; and estab-
lished his place in the Federal Parliament. Whoever
comes or :nes Hughes has to be reckoned with ; but he is
no longer a REiD-ite, or on the RsiD-ites’ list. This much
then has the week’s debate done. It has fixed a gulf
between Reid and the Freetrade Laborites. It has des-
troyed, not sunk, the fiscal issue in the Labor camp. It
has determined the Ministers to demand from the
machine the right to govern themselves, and this being so
the way is clear ahead for the Deakin combination, either
in front or behind Watson. If Deakin has his way it will
be behind. If the combined party has its way, I think it
will be in front.
Extract from a Canadian correspondent’s letter
in Brisbane Courier :
We want to deal fairly with our kinsmen across the
seas; we want to see Australia succeed as we do our-
selves. You need population, as we do. You may offer
them kindlier climate, more fertile soil, but if you want
the people to know it, blow your own horn ; spread
broadcast your pictures, not necessarily of the humble
cottage of the earlier settler, but of the palace of the
old. Show your possibilities, stir up the ambition of
your would-be compatriots. You get a better citizen in
the end.
The Courier thinks this is a great idea, and says
“ Advertise ! ” But haven’t the Courier’s friends
(and the Courier) been advertising Australia for
all they were worth ? Didn’t their whole stinking-
fish crowd advertise Australia as a country that
wouldn’t admit six English hatters —who had
been admitted all the time? Didn’t thevadvertise
Australia as an uncivilised country whose Gov-
ernment held off a drowning crew with
pitchforks said crew having been decently
and comfortably provided for all the time ?
Didn’t the same stinking-fish crowd advertise
Australia as a debased land, which rushed a
German into gaol simply because he couldn’t read
Greek—the fact being that the “ German ” was a
half-breed Egyptian and a criminal, who was
merely detained until he could be shipped back
home? And when the Courier’s stinking-fish
friends have spread their little advts. over the
earth, they stand back and point to the fact that
there isn’t any great rush by immigration to these
parts, and they say that the Labor party ought to
be ashamed of itself.
♦
The “ great natural industries” of Westralia have
entered upon the same system of cadge and sponge
as their brethren in the East have long been
famous for. Westralia is this year building up,
in proportion to population, the Continent’s boss
deficit, and Premier Jimmy is looking forward to
the time 18 months hence when he will be able to
borrow “plenty of money” and repair the local
culvert; yet “an amended scheme of subsidies ”
has been adopted by the Minister for Lands under
which “subsidy on the basis of 10s. in the £ on
cash prizes may be paid to agricultural societies,
horticultural societies, poultry societies, ploughing
matches, and pruning contests.” The great
natural industries take so much propping that a
man can’t even grow an out-size in pumpkins now
without requesting a trifle from the Treasury with
which to celebrate the vegetable.
♦
From a man who has the misfortune to be
acquainted with Bent :
As could hardly have been otherwise, considering: the
nature of the person, Bent is fighting- his election on lines
of gross personalities and petty insinuations. His hypo-
critical pretence of ignorance of MacKinnon’s land policy
was the most childish of fakes. “ What is an unimproved
land-value tax?” said he ; “I would like to know what
that means.” Yet Hansard for ’93 (vol. 72, p.p. 780 and
781) reports Bent as saying : “ I see no difficulty whatever
in imposing a tax on unimproved land values. I would
ask why a man who has a piece of land in Melbourne should
not be taxed as well as a man who has land in the country.
If a man erects a house on his land he pays a tax on every-
thing he uses, and gives employment as well; there may
be another piece of land adjoining whose value is improved
by the industry of this individual, and the owner does not
pay one penny in taxation. ... If, instead of there being
an exemption, the tax were made to fall upon the land,
the idea would be removed that it was a party or class
tax.” Which exemplifies MacKinnon’s policy to a T. Then
the ignorant, scrubby man went on to vilify a couple of
ex-railway men, saying they were strikers who had got
pensions by pretending illness, and “ now wanted to crawl
back to the Department.” One of them promptly proved
that he left the railways five months before the strike, that
he was retired after proper medical examination,
and that Bent himself had signed the papers
approving his retirement. Of the other, Mr. A. M. David,
of Ballarat, Bent said : “ This gentleman worked the
usual ‘bodily infirmity’ dodge, got his pension, and
straightway went on the Stock Exchange.” David
quietly replied that, as he had joined the service in 1885,
he had never been entitled to a pension, that he had
not retired through illness, but because he saw more
scope for a smart, self-respecting man outside, and that
if he chose to become a stockbroker it was entirely his
own business. Also, he hinted at a libel action, where-
upon Bent apologised in a hurry. Bent is dragging Vic-
torian politics to the level of the gutter, and the only
amazing thing about him is how he ever attained to a
seat even in a municipal council. And That is what
Brighton preferred to George Higinbotham !
+
South Australia’s cantankerous Jenkins is again
giving trouble. There is a sort of understanding
that the Commonwealth will build a railway to
connect Westralia with the eastern States, and
Premier Watson is anxious to keep this promise,
or half-promise, to the letter. The railway, how-
ever, can’t be made without the consent of S.A.
and Westralia; and Premier Watson wants to
know, before spending £20,000 or so of public
“splosh” on a survey of the route, if S.A.’s con-
sent will be forthcoming. But a long correspond-
ence has failed to drag from the shifty Jenkins,
who seems to be even more sour than usual, any
statement as to whether his Ministry will let the
Commonwealth supply S.A. with a valuable rail-
way at the Commonwealth’s own expense, and in
view of this hog attitude on the part of Jenkins
there is a deadlock. Jenkins, apparently,
hasn’t recovered from the recent trouble about the
nine Chinamen at Port Darwin. When those
heathens presented themselves at Australia’s back
door, and the Federal Government hesitated
about letting them in, Jenkins declared that they
were all “known residents” of the Northern


Territory, and that to shut them out was an out-
rage. Later it proved that they were all frauds
who had neiEpr been in the Territory before, and
when Jenkins was asked why he had guaranteed
nine strange swindlers as well-known local citizens
there was no answer—only a noise like a very
angry man banging Picturesque Atlases about
in the distance.

Australians ought to rush the new play at
Her Majesty’s (Sydney). It will show them the
son of one of their bushrangers—which bushranger
is not specified—occupying a front place in the
dress circle of English society. “Raffles” is the
name of the son and of the comedy-drama.
Raffles’ father died whilst bushranging in Aus-
tralia, but whether he died through trying to
climb up a rope with his neck is also not specified.
But he must have ’ranged successfully and got a
capital run for some one else’s money to be able to
give his son a University education and the
enefits of travel and the best tailoring. Young
Mr. Raffles, when the play opens, is the
pet of an aristocratic group; yet this finely
tailored person, who makes despairing speeches in
beautiful prose, whose superb self-possession never
fails him, who has won the heart of a noble girl—
of a lot of noble girls—is a thief, and is known to
the police as an amateur cracksman. Because he
does not thieve for a living he’s an amateur. He
steals ancestral jewels, crown diamonds, and the
like; then when he’s tired of laughing at news-
paper accounts of the robberies and the antics of
the detectives he returns the property to its owners.
The play is welded out of stories by E. W. Hor-
nung. If Conan Doyle were not Hornung’s brother-
in-law, Doyle might say to Hornung, “I wish
you wouldn’t be following my Sherlock Holmes.”
To which Hornung might retort, “I ain’t follow-
ing him ; I’m only going in the same direction—
and a long way behind, too.”

Men who write for certain papers have found
fault with Raffles, saying he’s an improbability. So
he is, and partly because the audience was tired of
probabilities (such as the gas man, the rent collec-
tor. and the servant girl giving notice) it gave
Raffles, at the end of the third act and at
the fall of the curtain, the most spon-
taneous bursts of applause given in the new
theatre. Not until Raffles loves and is beloved
by a lady of quality does he discover, and regret,
with a broken voice, that he is a “criminal.” Men
in love are apt to take themselves too seriously.
Raffles is a sport who goes a-burgling for much the
same reasons that the Alpine climber walks on his
hands on the top of the outer edge of an ice preci-
pice. If he married the lady by-and-bye he would
certainly pick the performing bishop’s pocket of
his gold timepiece and return it (with a graceful
speech) at the breakfast. But whether he marries
the lady or not doesn’t appear. As the house-
breaking amateur Cuyler Hastings has a character
that suits him from the ground up to the
American parting of his hair. Even his assumed
coldness in the love scenes is “right there.”
Miss Chevalier as Gwendoline does her
best acting since her part of Lady Marv in the
“ Admirable Crichton.” Miss Lane as the tem-
pestuous Mrs. Vidal acts up to her usual good
standard. Miss Susie Vaughan and Miss King-
ston adorn the drawing-room scenes. Hamilton
Stewart and Athol wood, as a detective and an
insanitary burglar respectively, make the most of
their limited opportunities.

This coming Saturday Tom Nawn’s Co.,
which supplies music and comedy cut into short
lengths at the Palace, will have its first complete
change of bill. There have been one or two small
changes already : Mr. Pete Barker has remodelled
his first night entertainment, and now does some-
thing up to his reputation ; and the “tossing
Austins,” the xylophonists, and Mr. and Mrs.
Nawn and others furnish an artistic variety
programme.

The “Marriage of Kitty” is the struggle
for a Man, with £lO,OOO a year in his pocket.
It is a struggle between Twenty-eight and
Forty; Twenty-eight, who finds herself left
with £9B Bs. 4od. and a rooted aversion to
work ; Forty, rheumatic-y, but with the advan-
tage of having been over the course before.
It looks a fair race, though on paper the Widow
should win. But Twenty-eight doesn’t run fair.
The £16,000 a year (with Man attached) comes
from an Uncle John, who has passed the cash on
to Reggie on condition that he promptly marries
somebody who isn’t a Peruvian widow —and Forty
is a Peruvian widow. (Uncle John knew her.)
. Of course to Reggie the widow is the only woman
in the world ; therefore, not to lose either
widow or fortune, he is advised to marry “any
old thing,” get a divorce, and then marry
Forty. Kitty agrees to be “any old thing,”
makes up for the part (this is where Kitty
runs crooked), and is married. The £16,000-
a-year happens to meet her later; and then the
race really starts. Kitty has got tired of that sort
of marriage; a settlement isn’t everything. So
the two turn into the straight—charming Twenty-
eight, wife already; Forty not charming but a
widow and a fiancee. Even now The Bulletin
would put a shilling on the Widow if she didn’t
so greatly neglect her opportunities. But she
knows really nothing of the business; and while
Kitty is giving the Man visions in a tea-gown of
pink mousseline-de-soie, the other one offers him a
nightmare in hysterics. Of course the tea-gown
wins. It is the Triumph of the Milliner.
* * * *
The first act is the finest, and shows Miss
Rose Musgrove—she who is Twenty-eight—at
her best. It is at the office of her godfather,
Reggie’s solicitor, the go-between in all the trans-
actions. “Can you make yourself look ugly?”
asks the godfather. “Oh, any woman can do
that ” —and off comes two-thirds of her thatch ;
the rest (the cruel disillusionment of it !) goes up
into a plait at least four inches long, a
tug at the neat. travelling clothes here
and a shove there, and Jealousy can’t live in the
same room. Reggie sees his bride and is ill; the
Peruvian lady sees her and is happy. The trans-
formation is a liberal education for a man who
hasn’t a sister, and a nightmare for the man who
only hopes to have a wife. Alone it would almost
carry the comedy. Wilfred Draycott is a robust,
even florid, Reggie. The piece is Anglicised
French, but Reggie has been left half-way. Neither
adapter nor actor seems to have quite made up his
mind what to do with him. In the French he
may have been a rou6; here he may be anything
at the start, but the final conception of him is a
Reggie. Why Kitty should really fall in love with
him is one of the unsolved mysteries, and how long
even she will hold him Heaven only knows. Miss
Hamer is the widow who doesn’t know half as
much as a widow should —an adventuress
who is hysterical and spoils everything. A
difficult part and a rather thankless one; yet
there is no weak point in her rendering of it.
Athol Forde has the heavy but easier role
of godfather-solicitor—just an ordinary lawyer.
Practically these four complete the cast. Three
servants come and go and do little, but do it well.
Miss Le Clercq, a dainty French maid, will be seen
in larger parts presently ; she made this small one
full of character. Compared with the smart dia-
logue the mounting and dressing go for little ; yet
in three acts Miss Musgrove contrives to wear five
frocks, including the fatal mousseline-de-soie. Also
she sings to her Reggie, and so adds one more
charm to a performance which, on the opening
night of the season, was enjoyed by the brightest
audience which Sydney Criterion has held for
many a day.

Sydney Lyceum, at one time the recog-
nised home of the theatrical bigamist, the dead
body in the river, the forged will, and the com-
busted dwelling with the heroine throwing herself
and her wild back-hair from the top window, re-
opens on Saturday after a long silence. It makes
its re - appearance under improved conditions
with Stephenson’s Musical Comedy Co. in “The
Rose of the Riviera.” The co. is a strong one with
some old-time favorites mixed with new stars.
** * *
The “Players” were again in evidence
last week at Sydney Lyceum, and on Satur-
day night produced Arthur Jones’ power-
ful four-act solemnity, “The Physician.” In
its way “The Physician” is a masterpiece.
It preaches a powerful temperance sermon,
but carefully keeps its drunk out of sight.
There is no squalor about it. The debased one
is a rapt prohibition worker, who takes lightning
trips through the British Isles, fighting for the
cause and getting wildly and dreadfully screwed
in the London slums, and comes back a Wreck
to be nursed round by his trusting sweet-
heart, and the almighty expensive London
specialist whom she has hired to treat her Wreck
for nervous prostration and overwork. The
Physician struggles to reform the Wreck,
then buries him decently in New York,
and comes back to marry his sweetheart. Mr.
Philip Lytton staged the play in his usual
excellent style, but neither he nor Mrs.
Lytton appeared in the caste. Lincoln
Jones made a good, convincing specialist,
while R. Gray was a little less satis-
factory as the repentant but unregenerate
Wreck. Miss Beatrice Brandon Usher filled the
lfyd. of white muslin worn by Edana Hinde, and,
though a trifle weak, was charmingly free from
amateurishness. The shoulders and head-dress of
Miss Eadith Shepherd gave the part of Lady
Valerie a real halo of glory.

Since last week wrestler Carkeek’s toughest
jobs at the Tivoli have seemed to be when he has
stripped to grapple with Victor Sabas, the French
guide, philosopher, and friend of the large-sized
Algerian, Merzouk. Sabas’ style is Grseco-
Roman ; yet even in catoh-as-catch-can he gave
Carkeek a warm and willing ten minutes, though
the Cornish-American certainly never looked like
a loser. Sabas wants to bring Carkeek and Mer-
zouk togetherj but Carkeek’s agreement with
Rickards prohibits matches during the 16-we3ks
season. After that—well, anything may happen ;
though when wrestling champions get together it
takes a long time for anything to happen, as a
rule. A pretty exhibition was given at Saturday
afternoon’s matinee when Rivenhall, of J. C.
Williamson’s Co., put on the scanty clothes of a
Christian martyr of the Superbus period, and
struggled on Carkeek’s carpet for three minutes.
The ,Rickards co. has been strengthened by the
arrival of a Scotch contralto, Miss Jeanie Fletcher,
who sings the old songs sweetly and had a very
fine welcome on Saturday.

Since Fitzgeralds’ Circus came to Belmore
Park, impartial Time has rolled nearly three
months over the heads alike of the beautiful vision
that dances on the slack wire and the hyaena that
smiles a welcome at the door. Yet Time has been
kind to the brothers; business still flows their
way in a steady stream, and the lion and the tiger
continue to conduct themselves like well-ordered
citizens, so that the expense of burying trainer
Zapf, with full circus honors is postponed.

“The Golden Ladder,” revived by Bland
Holt, at Sydney Royal, last Saturday, is melo-
drama of an older-fashioned type than “The
Great Millionaire,” and suffers by comparison.
Still, it is a good story—in that part dealing with
the humble life of the Dickensesque Peckabys, an
excellent story —and, were it not for the fact that
the drama is rudely disturbed so that it may be
dragged, shrieking its protest, to Port Arthur,
where happen various utterly impossible
things in an utterly unreal setting, “The
Golden Ladder ” would be open to little
serious criticism. Act 11., showing “Russia’s
Iron Hand,” the shelling of a British mission
at Port Arthur and the sinking of a Russian war-
ship by Britain, is, presumably, dragged in to give
some up-to-date scenic effects, and to make an
ad clap-trapandum, appeal to the gallery; and it
seems to be popular enough ; but it is a big descent
from the coherent and reasonable happenings of
recent Bland Holt productions.
* * * *
The acting is, as usual with this co., evenly
good. Miss Ross as a heroine of sunshine and
shower acts with grace. Walter Baker represents
the heroic parson who goes to China as a
missionary and makes a fortune (a touch of
modern realism that!) and is good in patches;
but the part is an impossible one in which to
achieve any coherent impression. That’s the fault
of the dramatist and not of the actor. Albert
Norman earns the wages of sin (which is, as usual,
the glossiest bell topper in Acts 1 to 3 and gaol at
the end of Act 4) as the villain, and is such a
villain as every little milliner dreams of as pursu-
ing her with his evil intentions and the baleful
glitter of his hat. A very good bit of child acting
is that of Brightie Smith as Alexander Peckaby,
which name recalls that the brightest spots in the
drama are provided by Samuel Peckaby (Bland
Holt), with some assistance from his wife. Of the
benevolent vendor of cough candy, Holt gives an
amusing and sympathetic reading, which has a
good deal less than usual of Bland Holt and a
good deal more of the character that the dramatist
invented.
** * *
Lack of versatility is the rule with actors
who have sufficient weight for the name part in
“ Silver King.” There are three varieties of
Wilfred Denver —firstly, a drunken, horse-racing
fool, who carries a revolver in his pocket, and
whines about his dear wife and his hopeless de-
gradation, whilst refusing to listen to the lady;
secondly, the same Wilfred, scared into a sober
state and doing just what his wife tells him';
thirdly, a remorseful millionaire Denver, alias
Franklin, who broods over his lonely pork supper,
and dreams of a dead man’s hand that drags him
to the gallows. Melbourne has seen eight
or nine Denvers who were satisfactory peni-
tents in every case, but only one or two
of them —notably the versatile Titheradge—
could play the busted drunken punter and
the horror-stricken fugitive in a realistic man-
ner. Julius Knight took his turn, as the
Silver King, at Her Majesty’s on Saturday, and
that popular hero was sufficiently forceful and
pleasing without being priestly, in the part of the
returned convert. He wore his white hair short
instead of long, his legs were not dressed in
accordance with the familiar poster picture, his
fur-collared coat had none of the sad, sweet senti-
ment of the traditional Denver article, but in
other respects he came up to expectations after he
had struck the silver mine. He was not con-
vincingly drunk and restless at the outset, nor
strikingly effective in the second act; nevertheless
he gave a good, virile Julius Knight per-
formance. Miss Maud Jeffries seemed somewhat
dull (and mechanical as Nellie Denver, judged
by comparison with her clever work in previous
parts. None of the other principals scored a con-
spicuous success or otherwise, but the Jaikes of
Eardley Turner, who made the old man less
ancient and creaky than usual, was interesting in
spots. Also little Miss Denver approached nearer
to naturalism than any previous Cissy within this
scribe’s recollection. “ The Silver King ” is the
best of melodramas, and the present revival, being
highly respectable, although in no way brilliant,
will serve to fill Her Majesty’s every evening until
next Wednesday, when the season closes.
** * *
The first week of “Three Little Maids”
left it still an open question as to whether the
new Gaiety Co. will achieve a boom, or merely
establish a success in the best business sense of
the word. For those people who prefer corned
beef and carrots to young lamb and peas, and whose
taste inclines to dumplings with the beef, the
present menu at the Princess’s is not every-
thing they could desire. “ Three Little
Maids” has the merit and the disadvantage of
being written and composed by one man, whereas
the ordinary musical comedy is worked up by two
or three librettists and the same number of
musicians. The sole manufacturer of this
straightforward little piece called it a
“musical play.” The occasional ballad or
duet is introduced in a conversational manner as
though the talkers were bursting into song for the
sake of variety. There is no chorus worth
mentioning, nor any interpolated items which
overwhelm the narrative for fifteen minutes at a
time, and cause its reappearances to look like
unwarrantable intrusion. Liking the “ Three
Little Maids ” at a first hearing, one is bound to
like it better next time, for the refinement of the
humor is more keenly appreciated, and the
characters grow more interesting on acquaintance.
Besides, the general “pitch” of the performance
has been raised since the first night. The
sweet, clear warble of Miss Delia Mason,
as the very sentimental Maid, is a particular
pleasure, and the English lord who talks and
walks and has his being in the person of G. P.
Huntley, promises to stamp this show upon the
memory of every citizen whose mind is open to
receive an indelible impression. The art of the
actor identifies the absurdity of Lord Cheyne with
the fact that his noble pedigree is devilish long
and unquestionably genuine. If he were not as
pure bred as a prize dog with a black roof to its
mouth he couldn’t have quite the same mannerisms,
although he had led the same “fearful life” in the
same fashionable set. All the brains in his lord-
ship’s ancestry for the past five centuries have
been tired. Like the old English proverb, “0
Lor’, O dear ! 0 dear, O Lor’ ! ” which he quotes
incidentally, the brains of his forefathers went out
of use. There was no call for them.

At Melbourne Royal there is a rather un-
seasonable melodrama wherein the Soldiers of the
King figure numerously from time to time, headed
by an evil captain and supported in the rear by a
blatant brass band. The captain is a bigamist in
a large way of business, and when his wives, law-
ful and otherwise, begin to clash with the new
girl he has arranged to marry, he removes No. 1
from his path, and disowns No. 2, who is
hampered with a baby which she describes as a
burden of shame. The burden of shame gets
saved from a watery grave along with its mother,
who loses the run of her offspring and becomes a
hospital nurse on active service. Later on, the
lost child turns up as a junior member of the
Royal Irish, and his astonished mother receives
him from the hand of a dying soldier during a
battle. The rest of the drama is devoted to the
rout of some invisible Arab forces by the brass
band, the curtain falling on a triumphant muster
of the British Army. Manager Anderson has
spared no supers and scenery in the mounting
of “ Tommy Atkins.” George Rignold staged the
same drama at the Royal eight years ago, when
the production was respected for its liberal display
of auxiliaries in uniform. The present show is
not less densely populated. One way and another
it stirred the feelings of a wet, muddy audience
last Saturday night, in spite of the weather.
When the bigamous officer, or a depraved
accomplice, was denying one of his crimes, a voice
from the gallery called him a Liar, and the house
greeted the impeachment with warm applause.

The last nights of the Uessem boys are
passing at Melbourne Opera House, but the names
of the other people who will arrive when that
wonderful turn is withdrawn had not been stated
at the time this paragraph went to ink. Mean-
while Burke, Moller, and Fuller —which is a
heavy, wearisome combination of titles for a
variety sketch —have earned a good charac-
ter for the tail-end of their performance.
Burke, Moller, and Fuller strike one as being
misguided American citizens until they cease their
foolishness and start to dance. Burke, the male
member of the trio, is an exceptionally cute and
graceful dancer, superior even to Hugh Ward in
Hugh’s happiest way. This is a matter to be
noted, because the preliminaries to Butke’s dancing
are so sad that the more jaded patrons of Rickards’
have been observed to rush away to the refresh-
ment bar, and so lose the real show.
** * *
At Adelaide Royal, the Pollard co. has
finished its quick-change season of comic opera
with a single performance of “ The Geisha.”
“The Belle of New York” proved to be the
biggest attraction, and was well presented. Alf.
Stephens, W. S. Percy and Harry Quealey, with
Olive Lenton, Jessie Ramsay, Alice Pollard and
Nellie Wilson make up a very useful team of
principals, and they alternate the leading parts in
a give-and-take way that is unusual. Arthur
Crane was dropped into “The Belle” ; his acting
has greatly improved. At the Tivoli, the quiet
humor of C. P. Bates contrasts curiously with the
mercurial efforts of the rest, who infused into
“Mama’s New Husband” much fun that did not
naturally belong to it. The present production is
“ Brown’s in Town,” advertised by posters show-
ing all the stock characters of the Yankee stage
crowded into a drawing-room, where a fire-hose
is being played full on a man’s face. This scene,
with strange though unconscious satire, is labelled,
“ The acme of Comedy.”
Defence Minister Dawson started as whip
boy ; has been also grocer and editor (Chai'tei .
Towers Eagle). Ultimately became an amalgr -
mator, and is one still—not an engine-driver, a
some papers have incorrectly stated.

The Wild Cat Column.
S.M. Herald in a recent leading article wasn’t
above propping up the Victorian Bent Government by the
further circulation of a very exploded old lie : —-
“ He (Bent) reminds the electors that since Mr. Irvine
took office a debit of £900,000 has been changed into a
surplus of £500,000.”
The simple facts of the case, which can be verified by any
one who cares to look up Coghlan’s latest statistics, are
these:—
Peacock came into office in January, 1901, and he
closed his financial year at 30th June, 1901, with a
surplus of about £40,000.
Irvine and Bent came into office at the beginning of
June, 1902, and they closed their first financial year on
30th June, 1902, with a deficit of £400,000, for which
Peacock was largely responsible, though it was made
worse by the efforts of Irvine and Bent to put Peacock’s
accounts in the worst possible light.
Irvine and Bent said that they (through their own
bad management) saw a prospect ahead of a deficit of
£900,000 in 1903, but no such deficit was ever shown to
exist, and if it ever existed Irvine, Bent, and Shiels were
responsible. The year closed at 30th June, 1903, with a
deficit (Irvine and Bent’s deficit) of £lOO,OOO or so,
which was turned into a considerable surplus by annex-
ing sinking funds as revenue.
Bent says that there is a £500,000 surplus now—
including the stolen sinking funds —but refuses to pub-
lish any figures in support of his statement.
Therefore the record of the Irvine-Bent crowd is that it
was partly responsible for the deficit of 1902 ; it was wholly
responsible for the deficit (turned into a surplus by steal-
ing the sinking funds) of 1903 ; and it refuses to publish
any evidence in support of the alleged surplus for 1904.

The net additions for the year were £107,966.
The expense rate has been higher than usual,
mainly through the item, “ Brokerage, commission, and
travelling agents’ expenses, £24,376,” as against £19,714
in 1902. This appears to be chiefly the result of a larger
proportion of rejected proposals and the smaller average
amount of the issued policies. Ten years ago this average
was £297 ; in 1901 it was £257 ; in 1902, £262 ; last year it
was only £233. Progress (or otherwise) in the matter of
total expenses has been for 10 years :

But the earnings ought to be calculated on total funds,
including investment fluctuation reserve ; the amount to
the credit of that reserve is supposed to be represented
by just as hard assets as are held against the other

1899 .. 319 4 „ 1902 .. 319 4
1900 .. 317 11 „ 1903 .. 319 8
These are unusually low earnings, and seem to suggest
either that the securities are very gilt-edged indeed, or
that very considerable writing- down ought to be done.
And they don’t look anything extra in the way of gilt-
edge. The distribution of assets of the Maoriland Life
Department, the A.M.P., and the Colonial Mutual com-
pares in this way :

“Freehold and leasehold property” seems to be the
weak point in the society’s affairs. Also, through the
multiplicity of branch offices scattered over half the globe
unusually large cash balances have to be maintained. But
this least can be said i That while other societies* earn-
mgs on total funds are still falling a little, the Colonial
Mutuals are improving’.

That is, all shares will have a liability of £2 10s., no
matter whether they are £3 10s. or £5 shares. In certain
circumstances (possibly remote) the few £5 shares (£2 10s.
paid) may be no better than those paid to £l. Under
the amended arrangement of 1897 it was provided that
the shareholders of the bank may, after depositors and
stock-holders are paid, “ out of any surplus profits receive
a dividend of 2s. per share per annum.” While there are
any “A” and “B” depositors or inscribed stockholders,
it seems, therefore, that the £1 shares may get a 10 per
cent, dividend, but that the few £2 10s. shares may not
get more than 4 per cent. Yet even 4 per cent, looks a
long way off.
The directors don’t even now say that this is a
complete cleaning up. In fact, at the special meeting at
which this scheme was adopted the chairman said that
they didn’t say anything of that sort —which is a different
matter from saying nothing on the subject. They “do
not take the responsibility of saying that the amount now
proposed to be written off will be full cover for all losses
on the old business, as the difficulty of assessing the pre-'
sent value of assets of such great variety as the bank is
possessed of must be apparent.” That sounds like calls;
for the new business isn’t able to give much help. Since
the rearrangement in 1897 the profit has been :
Banking Profits £42,523
Profits by purchase of depreciated deposits 242,589
£285,112
Less written off 11,000
Total net profits (61 years) .. .. .. £274,112
As to the chances of a recovery, there naturally isn’t
much data available. When the bank’s affairs were gone
into in 1897 it had £1,214,319 sunk in pastoral properties
in Queensland, N.S.W., and (to a small extent) in the
Northern Territory. One firm alone had advances of just
over £700,000 ; another of just under £200,000. The'
whole of these were reckoned at the time to be worth
£602,750, leaving a loss of £611,569. Of the losses now
provided for, approximately £743,900 is in respect of pas-
toral properties. Thus, notwithstanding that there
have been some successful though small realisations
since, over £130,000 has now been provided for more
than was thought to be necessary seven years ago.
Presumably there must be rock-bottom somewhere ;
but securities that have gone 20 per cent, lower than what
was thought to be rock-bottom seven years ago (and that
was at least 50 per cent, lower than they had been
reckoned at a few years previously) aren’t pleasant securi-
ties to have about the premises. And whether the bank
will pull through without calls or not (apart from any that
it may be thought necessary to make in order to work the
new business) depends upon how those securities behave
themselves during the next few years. Just at present,
some of them are not shaping very well. Rabbits are
giving the A. J.S. a lot of trouble in one quarter.
The A. J.S. Bank’s new business is said to be
safe, if not highly profitable. Only £lO,OOO, it has been
stated by the directors, has been lost since 1897 ; and that
has been provided for in ordinary course. The burden is
being steadily reduced by the repurchase of deposit
receipts at a discount—which may not be a nice way for
a bank to reduce its burden ; but the A. J.S. can’t afford
to be too nice. And the turnover is obviously increasing
(the balance-sheets show that); and, in spite of the con-
cern’s shocking record, there is no reason why it shouldn’t
increase, seeing that new business is a first charge on all
assets, both old and new, and is thus very well secured.

The capital is now £125,000, as against £lOO,OOO hitherto ;
the 2500 new £lO shares have been issued to existing
shareholders at £22 10s. each, so that the 17} per cent,
dividend on these shares is equal to a shade over 7J per
cent. It is impossible to say very accurately what the
shareholders’ funds have earned on account of the new
share capital and premiums having come in at various
times during the half-year. On the basis usually adopted
—that of capital and reserves as at the commencement
of the term —the earnings were at the rate of £l2 os. 4d.
per cent, per annum. Taking, however, the mean
of the total funds as at the commencement and at the end
of the half-year as a basis, the earning-s were at the rate
of £ll os. sd. per cent, per annum. This compares with
recent earnings (on the basis of funds as at the commence-
ment of each half-year) as follows:
March, 1901.. £7 6 8 p.c. March, 1903.. £lO 15 6 p.c.
Sept., 1901.. 10 15 6 „ Sept., 1903.. 11 14 0 „
March, 1902.. 10 9 1 „ March, 1904.. 11 0 5 „
Sept., 1902.. 9 1 3 „
These are remarkable results—just about as good as any
that Australia can show. The Bank of Australasia alone
publishes figures which work out at a higher rate ; its last
half-year’s rate was £ll 3s. 3d. The Bank of Australasia,
by the way, is the institution whose general manager has
just been deploring the results of Socialistic legislation.
Two Maoriland institutions show still higher figures ; and
Maoriland has had a good deal of Socialistic legislation too.
Some general managers evidently don’t even yet know
which side of the bread the butter is on.
The Westralian Bank’s present position com-
pares with that of 12 months ago in this way :

Twelve months ago liquid assets were equal to 59 per
cent, of all liabilities to the public ; they are now equal to
58 per cent. The proportion is very high, but as against
this the very large amount of-deposits not bearing in-
terest, and presumably at call, must be set. Of the assets
£866,774 is now in coin, against £777,167 a year ago. A
satisfactory feature is the growth of the holding of public
securities, though the amount is still small. The increase
in advances rather more than absorbs the additions made
to capital and reserves during the year, which is a satis-
factory feature.

This is another remarkably fine result ; on total share-
holders’ funds (capital and reserves) as at the commence-
ment of the half-year, the profit was at the rate of £lO
Bs. sd. per cent, per annum. In the previous year the
rate was £9 6s. per cent. As to how the profit was made
the balance-sheet gives no hint —it is all simply described
as “ profit on transactions.” In addition to shareholders’
funds the eo. is working on £25,226 owing to depositors
and other creditors ; and its assets consist of freehold
properties £30,991, borrowers’ and purchasers’ balances
£60,836, and a cash balance of £1604.

According to a full statement, just published,
the renewal of Victoria’s unfortunate £5,000,000 loan last
year resulted in an addition of £309,712 to the public
debt, but against this the saving in interest amounts to
£39,160 a year. So if this £39,160 per annum simply goes
to aid the revenue, then £309,712 of interest has been paid
out of loans —and so far nothing has been heard of any
part of the saving being applied in reduction of the loss
on the renewal of the loan. The £309,712 is simply the
price paid for the saving in interest, and if the whole
amount saved in interest is spent in the usual way, and
the price of the saving is made part of the permanent
debt, the transaction is pure swindle.

Bent’s trains are still making records ; 7000
pairs of rabbits were recently condemned in one day at
the Government Freezing Depot, having decayed en route.
The main reason was that Bent’s trains went too slowly,

railway service that can’t go fast enough to keep ahead of
a germ.

The paid capital is now £15,200 against £15,000 six
months ago. The reserves consist of depreciation fund
£1229, reserve fund £750, and undivided profit £123.
If the depreciation fund represents depreciation which has
already taken place the reserves are, of course, only £873.
The half-year’s profits were at the rate of £7 Is. 4d. per
cent, per annum on capital as at the commencement of
the half-year ; the previous half-year’s rate was £6los. Bd.
The co. is increasing its deposits slightly (now £SSOI), but
its loans on mortgage (£26,331) are increasing faster ; in
fact, it has had to acquire an overdraft, so the increase is
probably too rapid.

In the first five months of the current financial
year, which began on October Ist, Cobar Gold Mines made
a profit of £15,639 ; previous year’s profit, after writing
off £5722 for depreciation, was £21,545 ; so that, with
£4991 brought forward, the co. had at the end of February
£42,175, practically all in hand. Board’s intention is to
distribute none of this money, but to nurse it in view cf
the need which will soon arise to work the sulphides.
Present oxidised ores will be exhausted before the end of
this year, unless developments, which don’t look very
likely, occur, and then the mine will be a smelting pro-
position like Great Cobar ; and as a good deal of develop-
ment underground will also be necessary, directors have
wisely resisted pressure put upon them to pay even a
shilling div. Mention was made at the meeting in London
of an amalgamation with the adjoining Chesney, but no
formal steps were taken to bring it about.
* * * *
The first report of the new Mt. Lyell Co. (Tas.)
does not make comforting reading. There was a net
profit of £110,950 on about 7£ months’ work at the amal-
gamated mines; this is after providing £13,843 for
prospecting, and crediting £13,966 to an account to pay
for removing overburden ; but nothing has been written
off for depreciation. Of the £13,966 put to overburden
account all but £2174 was spent. Therefore, without
writing off anything for depreciation, the true profit was
£113,124. The total quantity of ore treated, including a
small lot of by-products from Crotty smelting works,
was 240,554 tons ; the yield was 4944 tons copper,
510,9060 z. silver, and 13,1390 z. gold. Taking- the whole of
the profit as made from copper, it is equal to £22 17s. 9d.
per ton produced. With copper at from £57 to £5B, this
is a very good margin to work upon. But general manager
Sticht’s estimates of the stuff remaining don’t make
things appear as pleasant. The value of the Mt. Lyell
ore treated during the term and the value of the ore
estimated to be now in the mine compare in this way:—
Copper. Silver. Gold.
Treated to March 31st .. 1'25 p.c. 2'170z. 0’0660z.
Reserves in the mine .. 0'59 p.c. l - 990z. 0.040 z.
Approximately, the Mt. Lyell ore treated during the
period was worth 245. 6d. per ton gross ; while the reserves
in the mine are worth, at the same metal prices, only 14s.
sd. Per ton of ore the present costs are 15s. lT6d., which
is a good deal less than the old Mt. Lyell Co. ever reached ;
so that, although these very large reserves exist, it looks
as though the only hope of working large quantities of
them lies in further reduction of costs, in the discovery
of rich bodies in North Lyell, or in improved prices.
And prices have frequently been a good deal lower
than they are at present. Nor is there any level at which
the ore is very strikingly superior to the average. Sum-
marised, the reserves are estimated as follows :
Levels. Tonnage. Copper. Silver. Gold.
Above No. 4 837,793 o'7o p.c. 1'720z. o'osoz.
Nos. k and 5 1,682,889 o'6o „ 2'oo „ o'o4 „
Nos. '5 and 8 1,974,628 0'53 „ 2'09 „ o'o2 „
4,495,310 0'59 p.c. 1'990z. o'o4oz.
The bottom level by itself shows o'sooz. copper, 1'540z.
silver, and o'o2oz. gold—the poorest of all. What there
is below No. 8 level it is impossible as yet to say ; and,
judging by what is at No. 8, it doesn’t at present seem to
matter either.
The ore reserves at North Lyell are a matter of
guess-work mostly. They occur in disconnected and
variable bodies. General manager Sticht estimates them
as follows : —Available by open cutting, 22,129 tons;
available by mining, 148,365 tons ; total, 170,494. This
is down to the 500 ft. level, and as far as explored. As to
value, going upon past results, they may be—Copper,
6'25 p.c. ; silver, 2'250z. ; gold o'oosoz. —which, however,
as Sticht admits, would in the circumstances not be a
payable grade without the Lyell ore to serve as flux and
fuel. What isn’t known now, any more than it was
before Sticht made his latest estimate, is the quantity of
ore in Lyell of approximately the grade which has been
treated lately. The profit in the 7t months was equal to
about 9s. 2d. per ton of ore. But, as shown, the Lyell
reserves average 10s. Id. less than the value of the stuff
lately treated ;so where is the profit ? Except, of course,
by picking the stuff, as has evidently been done, in order
to make the profit now shown ; and that can only be done
by still further reducing the average value of what is left.
* * * *
It seems most likely that Lyell ore is useful only
for flux, and that for ore the co. must depend on North
Lyell for the present. Here there is 21 months’ supply,
and about 4s. in divs. sure. Outside that everything
depends on:—
I. Development of ore in North Lyell at depth •
11. Use of metal-bearing' flux quarries ; ’
111. Purchase of outside mines which may have ore '
or IV. Improvement in method of treating low grade
ores of mines and field.
As to 1., four bore holes at the North Lyell 400 ft. level
have proved a serious constriction of the ore body from
the 300 ft. down. No real development has been done at
500 ft.; so that it is surmise to say what exists there. But
it is not too clear that the ore isn’t pitching into the Crown
Lyell. As to 11. the South Tharsis flux can’t be reckoned
in—what little is left of it—and the Royal Tharsis flux
lias to be mined. Besides, its grade is low—l-5 copper.
As to HI., the Lyell Tharsis is the only show avail-
able, and it is but 3 per cent, stuff. Co. may see its way to
pay for the bit of good ore left in the Lyell Blocks. As to
IV., the ore of the field is so low grade that, unless some-
thing new turns up, no plant in the world will make it
pay. Position, actually, on the basis of North Lyell
170,494 tons of 6 per cent, ore, is that about 600,000 tons
of Mt. Lyell ore may be mined to flux it. Remainder of
low-grade ore may be turned to account on somewhat the
same lines as they treat pyrites at the Rio Tinto, in
Spain, but that’s dubious. So, if one puts 10s. a share
value on Mt. Lyell scrip, after calculating all assets in, he
makes a liberal estimate of! its to-day’s worth. This, of
course, is not taking into account anything outside
Sticht’s figures, as developments have to be chanced.

Lyell Blocks’ (Tasmania) new plant has been
given a trial spin, followed by a joyful chorus from visit-
ing directors. Yet share values have gone back, for more
calls are to be made. Duff, the chairman, hasn’t been seen
calculating figures in his note book of late, so there may
be something ahead at last. Nicholas, mine manager, got
a 90 per cent, recovery of copper with the Wilfley tables.
As the specific gravity of the metal and the pug is so
diverse, it would have been a miracle if a good recovery,
had not been achieved. Nicholas says capacity of plant is
at least 2000 tons a week. Probably Duff has worked out
what that tots up on 2 per cent, dirt, with all charges
paid. Why doesn’t he fire the fact out and stiffen up
scrip ?

Mount Lyell shareholders ought to turn up
holdings of directors to-day to compare them with hold-

Kelly held 1745, J. C. Syme 1050, W. Knox 1090, W.
Jamieson 1090, and Lindsay Tullock 1050. For holding
these shares each director gets £5OO a year. Most of them
have only their bare qualification. With the show in its
present state they’ll surely cut their screws.

It is recognised that much of the loss in con-
centration is due to the feeding at the same time of many
different sizes of ore particles, and while to a certain
extent the loss is obviated by the installation of hydraulic
classifiers, the constant addition of volume bf water in the
various stages of classification practically always entails
a heavy loss in fine mineral carried away in the overflow,
thus, though a more or less regularly graded product is
obtained and the percentage of saving over the concen-
trators, calculated on the value of the material fed on to
them, has been increased, yet the aggregate loss has not
been diminished. The McDermott Sizer differs from other
classifiers from the fact that the separation into various
sizes is effected by means of a submerged screen. Care-
ful tests have proved there is an absolute freedom of move-
ment of the particles under water, and that the pulp can
pass in succession through a series of screens each finer
than the preceeding, thus permitting effective separtion
into sizes most admirably adapted for close concentration
work. The Austral Otis Engineering Company of South
Melbourne, are the Agents and Sole Manufacturers of the
“ McDermott Sizer.”

London Mine, Ravenswood (Q.), looks a derelict,
but it is not exactly what it looks. At beginning of the
year things promised well; shares were steady. Then in
quick succession came a big drop in market values,
declaration of dividend, and resignation of directors and
mine manager. The secretary stuck to his post, however,
and with one or two more confident shareholders is now
disentangling the gear. Company has a good deal of
trouble ahead of it, and a call or two ere the next divi-
dend will be announced, but the mine should come right
with decent handling. Of all the States, Queensland is
most in need of the services of good geologists ;_but the
average Bananaland mine-manager scorns geologists.

HOW TO BE HAPPY.
HEBE: “ Well , how do you like being married ? ”
BENEDICT: “ Tip-top. Why, most of the time I
don't remember I'm married at all I ”
The usual winter massacre of shop assist-
the rag trade has begun in Sydney. At
the beginning of summer, when the busy season
opens, some unscrupulous drapers hire little hordes
of improvers to “ learn the business,” at anything
from nothing to 2s. 6d. a week. These are the
usual victims when winter dulness sets in, just as
they were expecting to get something in the way
of wages.

The British aristocracy supplies the world
with a good deal of amusement in a quiet way.
The latest outbreak of the salt of the earth is the
marriage of Emma, Dowager Countess of Ravens-
worth, to her youthful coachman. Emma had al-
ready planted two husbands, and is now aged 59.
Her second husband, the Earl of Ravensworth,
took her in 1892, when Emma was 47. He was
then an aged person of 71 with one foot and a
previous wife in the grave. He died in 1903,
being then in his 82nd year, and the tombstone
had hardly settled over his remains when the
mature Emma consoled herself with the coachman

Justice Gordon took his first Divorce Court
in Adelaide, the other day, and ran against a
tough argument for a start. The point was whether
a very small baby’s eyes had anything to do with
the case. Respondent’s lawyer said the infant
had the petitioner’s eyes; and if the petitioner’s
story was true, it ought to have had somebody
else’s. “-.Look at the child’s eyes and tell me,”
said the respondent’s lawyer to the petitioner.
“Don’t do anything of the kind,” said the peti-
tioner’s lawyer. Justice Gordon was appealed to.
He tried to smoothe the trouble away. ‘ ‘ What
will be the use ?” he asked. ‘ ‘ Merely a matter
of opinion—and what is his opinion worth ? ” The
infant cried, and the Court took a spell. The
Judge asked for authorities, but nobody had any
ready. “ All right,” said the petitioner, “ but I’ll
bring other witnesses—the child’s eyes must go in
as evidence somehow.”

Two politicians are going to enjoy the
blessed opportunity of proving their words. Act-
ing-Premier Wise, of N.S.W., has invited Oily
Joe Carruthers to explain what policeman and
which police magistrate were removed (apparently
Joe meant removed by the See Government) “ for
being just enough and brave enough to do their
duty.” And over in Maoriland, Tommy Taylor,
M.H.R., is being invited to pay £lOOO damages
for saying that Captain Seddon, son of King Dick,
was court-martialled in South Africa for running
away at a great pace and leaving his men. If Big
Dick’s military son and Thomas of the Teapot
really get into court they should, between them,
clear up a multitude of very curious rumors which
have drifted around for a long time.

A recent writer in Melbourne Herat.?)
shows the hypocrisy of the Fat party’s snuffle
about the stoke-hole of a mail steamer in the
tropics being no place for a white man and only
fit for a nigger. He quotes the temperature
of the engine-room and stoke-hole of the Friedrich
der Grosse, as taken from the chief-engineer’s log,
during her last run from Fremantle to Port Said,
March Ist to 22nd. Right through this tropical
run the engine-room averaged B'B° hotter than the
stoke-hold. The highest temperature the firemen
were expected to stand was 107‘6°, the lowest
96'8°; while the engine-room thermometer varied
from 107*6° to 116*6°. So far the Fatman has
expressed no concern for the steaming white engi-
neer ; nor has he explained why the British ships
must employ black labor while their German and
French competitors can run their boats with white
sailors and firemen.

No Public Board has
ever made more stringent
regulations to preserve itself from a
suspicion of nepotism and every kind
of family favoritism than have the Com-
missioners of N.S.W. Public Service.
The limits of relationship within which
they must not make appointments are
minutely defined. People they must not
appoint to the service include their
fathers, mothers, stepfathers and step-
mothers, brothers, sisters, half-brothers,
half-sisters, uncles, aunts, daughters-in-law,
brothers-in-law, nephews, &c., &c., also their
wives’ relations. If the Board wants to appoint
any relative to the Public Service except its great-
grandfather, it must certify in writing that the
country will be ruined without his assistance, and
the Governor must sign the document and seal it
with his seal of office.

‘ ‘ Balm Oral ” about Bent’s trains :
Our trouble began at Albury, where we got on the
Yictorian train and were shunted to a siding and left for
20 minutes locked up like cattle in a truck. We crawled
into Melbourne 20 minutes late. Next day we went to
Hamilton, in the western district, and on the trip lost
three-quarters of an hour. On the return trip the train
was 25 minutes late leaving Hamilton, hut made up a
little time before we reached Ballarat, where we got off for
the night. We got up next morning to catch the express
(my wife and mother were with me). These two ladies
were on the platform three minutes before the advertised
starting time, and the train was five minutes late
getting away, but as all carriage doors were locked
and not a porter within hail, they couldn’t get a
seat. I was patiently waiting in the parcels room for some
one to come to hand over the baggage. Five minutes before
the train started I was calling loudly for a porter to put
the baggage in the van, but all in vain, and the train
moved slowly off without us. The porters apologised and
told me that there were only two of them, and they were
on from 4.30 a.m. till 7.20 p.m. No more of Bent’s trains
for me 1

Not surprising that Edward VII. wrote a
letter of condolence to his old acquaintance, Mrs.
H. M. Stanley, formerly known as Dorothy
Tennant, a dashing figure in London’s “smart
set.”. Dolly Tennant was rather notorious for
running after society lions, and when at last she
became engaged to the elderly explorer one of her
toney lady friends —a duchess, or somebody—re-
marked “What a blessing that she isn’t going to
marry a black man! ” After their wedding the
happy pair got more advt. for a while than the
bride had expected. Poor Stanley was seized
with acute stomach pains—a return of his African
complaint—and he passed the early days of his
honeymoon in poultices.

The awful waste of child-life through the
feeding of the undesirable infant on improper food
has at last moved a "V ictorian coroner to commit a
nurse for manslaughter. The doctor who post-
mortemed the little incubus said :
The child was simply a skeleton covered with skin. He
could find no trace of disease causing death ; the child
had died of exhaustion, caused by improper food. It
weighed 7ilb., whereas it should have weighed 201 b.
Another doctor swore to the same effect: —
In his opinion the child had died of starvation. He had
never seen anything like it.
There was no question of lack of money in the
case, for the infant’s father had paid the nurse Bs.
a week regularly.

S. Australian Scotchbyterians have elected
as Moderator a man who seems to have some
ideas:—
Those ancient prophets only spoke when they had
something to say. Suppose we were to imitate them in
that ? Better be silent than speak because we have got
to say something.
There is an impression that the citizens
own the Sydney pavements. This is incorrect;
the pavements belong to the butchers, slop tailors,
shoddy mongers, and furniture vendors, whose
right it is to let beef bleed, trousers flap, drapery
flutter, and furniture spread out on the pathways.
Certainly bye-law No. 14 prohibits the encroach-
ments, but bye-law No. 14 is hardly ever enforced.
Besides, it is seriously proposed to repeal bye-law
No. 14 and let beef bleed legally on the sidewalks.

English County Court Judge Parry, dis-
cussing the peculiarities of witnesses, in the Cokn-
hill Magazine, sets a problem for psychologists
to worry over :
One curious circumstance I have noticed in “running-
down ” cases is that a large percentage of witnesses give
evidence against the vehicle coming towards them. That
is to say, if a man is walking along and a brougham is in
front of him, and going the same way as he is, and a cab
coming in the opposite direction collides with the
brougham, I should expect that man to give evidence
against the cab.
Now why ?
“THE HERALD’S” DERANGEMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The S.M. Herald of Saturday, May 21, under
the general head of “The Federal Situation”
printed in double-column measure the following
staggering captions
Ministers to be Challenged.
Several Angry Brushes. Scene in the House.
Mr. Reid Refused a Hearing.
He Leaves the Chamber.
And immediately following these startling head-
lines was a verbatim report of Reid’s speech
in seven solid columns of brevier.
Is the Herald growing- balmy ?
Is it going off its dot ?
Is it ratty
On its chatty,
Patty,
Rotund Patriot ?
Is it off its blessed napper ?
Is it imbecile ? Or what ?
These remarks are not so stupid
As at first sight might appear.
Seven stolid,
Stodgy, squalid,
Solid
Columns of brevier
Formed the dismal Jeremiad
Which the House refused to hear I
“ Mr. Reid refused a hearing ! ”
Says the Herald, with a screech,
With a wailing,
Bitter, railing,
Hailing
Everyone in reach !
And below this very head-line
Is his seven-column speech !
Has the calm and stately Herald
Let its judgment go to pot ?
Through its pages
(Li ke the Age’s)
Rages
Rampant tommy-rot!
Has the common-sense of Watson
Caused bewilderment; or what ?
“ Mr. Reid refused a hearing ! ”
That’s the Herald’s very word !
Such a “ pitch ” is
Full of hitches,
Which is
Palpably absurd !
For the comps, set seven columns
Of the speech that wasn’t heard !

The hard-up S. Australian Treasury gets
another windfall through the death of reputed
millionaire J. H. Angas, though it will not be as
big a windfall as it would have been if Mr. Angas
hadn’t made such liberal gifts during his lifetime.
It is remarkable, considering what poor resources
the State owns, how great a number of fairly rich
men it has—or had. Per inhabitant its income
derived from private sources is reckoned less than
that of any other State (£4O 6s. per year against
N.S. Wales’s £45 18s. and Victoria’s £43 145.) j on
the other hand, in proportion to population,
nearly twice as many of its breadwinners get over
£2OO a year as in any other State. In prosperous
Westralia, for instance, only 5"9 per cent, of the
breadwinners top the £2OO mark; in S. Australia,
11’3 per cent. S. Australia, moreover, can save
on £2OO a year where Sydney and Melbourne
would ruin their butcher and bring their draper to
ashes. Most of its wealthy people put on no
‘ 1 side ” whatever, and the other crowd that isn’t
wealthy takes its cue from that; you can see more
Brummagem jewellery in one tram in Sydney
than you can blink at in 24 hours in Adelaide—
unless you happen to be out after 9 p.m. The
share-dealing crowd is certainly altering things a
trifle, but it hasn’t got far yet; and even some of
the share-dealing crowd is putting its money into
dairy cows instead of into diamonds for its wife.
S. Australia has a big pull, too, over
N.S.W. especially, in the fact that it hasn’t very
much of an absentee landlord curse. Except the
S.A. Association, those who took up the best of
the country in the early days still hang out in the
State, or have their descendants there ; and they
have not even got into the habit of tripping to
Europe for half their time. In fact, S. Australia
is a good deal of an absentee owner itself ; it has
used its geographical situation to get deep into
properties in south-west Queensland and western
N.S. Wales (though it got out of many of these
latter squattages at the right time), and it has had
most of the plums of Westralia and Broken Hill.
It even owned and ran what for many years was
N.S. Wales’ most profitable gold mine—the
Baker’s Creek, at Hillgrove—and some of its
judges thought it was going to own Mt. Morgan,
when that property was jumped. It also hung
on like glue to the only three big mines it ever
produced itself—the Burra, Moonta, and Wallaroo.

All manner of Tories and advocates of the
yellow-brown invasion assembled in force t’other
night at Hobart to hear Dr. Elkington, Tasmanian
Chief Health Officer, lecture about “Insects and
Disease.” The speaker said tropical diseases were
mainly due to insects which carry or develop
disease microbes, and when proper care is taken
against flies, mosquitoes and fleas, the white man
can live indefinitely and work satisfactorily in any
country or climate or zone. Medical science sur-
renders first place to sanitation. Drainage of
stagnant pools and prompt destruction of refuse
prevent insects breeding and make whole com-
munities healthy where formerly malaria, yellow
fever, typhoid, smallpox, plague and other dis-
eases were rampant. The doctor was heartily
applauded, the audience being too dense to see
that he was knocking the props from under
their wheezes about the impossibility of white
men living and working in Queensland and the
Northern Territory.

The Leichhardt (Sydney) ladies who decline
to appoint as life-governors *of their institution
the nominees of an art union charity committee
assert a sound principle. The money promised to
the institution was not the nominees’ money, nor
yet the committee’s; it was the shillings of the
public. If the claim were admitted—and, unfor-
tunately, some institutions do admit it—all the
institutions of the country could be worked in
under the wings of a coterie of charity-mongers
who gave nothing themselves. The rule entitling
the donor of a fixed sum to a life-governorship
was meant to cover only those who subscribed
their own money; it was never meant for the
sincere or insincere advertising cadger.
THE OLD HORROR.
Little Girl ( three years old, in her cot): “Please ma, will you look under my cot afore you
blow out the light ; a little boy might be there.”
After all the beating of the loyal drums
and banging of the plate for Melbourne Queen’s
Jubilee Memorial Hospital for Infectious Diseases
—started in ’97 and only now about to be opened—
it is discovered that the blessed institution
(having only one male and one female ward) can
treat only one form of disease at a time, most of the
£20,000 subscribed having been spent on ad-
ministrative offices, &c.
The disappearance of Gtippsland farmer
Bellerby brings up memories of similar unaccount-
able vanishings. Another Gippslander went to
Melbourne years ago, wandered on to a boat at
the wharf and stayed there, a victim of some
uncontrollable impulse. He went to India with
the ship, and worked there for five years, although
all the time aware who he was and where he ought
to be. Then, broken down in health, he returned
home, only to die. Twenty years ago Ebenezer
Neill, a rich Bendigonian, visited Melbourne, and
after a couple of days in town disappeared. That
was the last ever seen of him. A little later Con-
stable Ryan, of White Hills, near Bendigo, sud-
denly disappeared. He was supposed to have
been murdered at the Chinese camp, or to have
fallen down a disused shaft, but though thorough
search was made no trace of him was ever dis-
covered. A quarter-century back a Vic. western
district identity, a shire president and J.P.,
mysteriously vanished. He was sought high and
low, but vainly. Eight months later this victim
of meinory-lapse “ found himself,” working as an
Ordinary laborer at a Creswick flour mill. After
staying at home a while he had another seizure and
disappeared once more—never returning alive. The
body of a swaggie, drowned while swimming the
Murray near Corowa, was identified as that of the
missing man, and taken home and buried. Another
lost person wandered into Russell-street (Mel-
bourne) police station one day in ’9B and asked to
be informed who he was. He had forgotten every-
thing—name, life-history, locality, all were a
blank. After long inquiry he was identified by
his wife as an Albury resident who had unaccount-
ably vanished long before. Even when identified
he failed to recognise her, and was taken home a
man with absolutely no past —to begin life afresh
and make love to a strange wife. Only a year or so
back Mr. Curran, well known in Port Melbourne,
left a lodge meeting one night to walk home and
never reached there. He is supposed to have been
drowned, but there is no certainty. Rosa Scholtz
is also among the list of the “wanteds.” She
faded into the ewiykeit one night in ’O3 after a dis-
agreement with her husband, a Fitzroy shop-
keeper, and so far remains missing. She was
suspected of having been murdered, but the closest
investigation gave no clue, and she may have
suicided or have wilfully kept in concealment; or a
memory lapse may have overtaken her and she
simply can’t return, no matter how badly she is
wanted. The memory is a vague, uncanny sub-
ject, and seems liable to give out when it is most
required or to go off at a tangent at any untoward
juncture.

This is the sort of item that one may find
almost any day now in almost any paper pub-
lished in Western Victoria
The return of Mrs. Robert Chirnside to Carranballac
after a three years’ visit to Europe, was made the occasicn
of a very hearty demonstration of welcome by the resi-
dents of Skipton. The township was decorated with flags
and arches. The school children sang appropriate songs
and marched in procession. Mr. E. C. Earles, J.P., and
Rev. F. M’Queen, on behalf of the residents, welcomed
Mrs. Chirnside home, and Mr. J. H. Gardiner returned
thanks on behalf of Mrs. Chirnside.
The trail of the “squire” is over the land, and
whenever his aunt gets married, or his cousin goes
away, or the haughty parasite himself returns r
after spending the rents for three years in sup-
porting English instead of Australian industry,
some such crawl as this happens. The “villagers ”
assemble, also the school-children ; and the J.P.
is overcome with emotion, and the parson is full
of gladness, and everybody realises his proper and
humble station in life and blesses the shocking
little brass god and his relations.
The monument on St. Kilda-road (Melb.),
erected to the S’African glory of the sth Vic.
Mounted Rifles, will be formally “dedicated”
next Sunday afternoon. This depressing work of
masonry was completed many weeks ago, several
years after the contractor first took it in hand,
and the news, of its intended dedication is a rather
startling reminder that Melbourne in general had
forgotten the sad Jingo circumstances which led
up to the forthcoming event.

Outlawed Bushman Ellis, alias McKenzie,
required for the shooting of Collinson in
Maoriland, has gone into the apparition busi-
ness. Pie was seen at nine places, many miles
apart, within a fortnight of the murder, and on
each occasion (at night) dogs heralded his approach
by barking loudly. It is the habit of dogs to bark
loudly at persons suspected of murder. A week
later he was seen at White Rock station and at
Alfredton, 60 miles distant, on the same day and
hour. That night a boar rushed down from the
Rimutaka ranges and fell dead on the door-
step of the nearest police station, pierced by
a bullet which, it was at once decided, was fired by
Ellis. If two people meet in the scrub anywhere;
on the Wairarapa now, they dodge under coyer
simultaneously, and report the circumstance at the
nearest settlement with embroidery and informa-
tion concerning the color of Ellis’s eyebrows. Ellis,
was arrested at Waitara, on the other side of the
island, last week. He was potato digging at the
time. He was also arrested at other places. The
writer had a beer with Ellis last week. The
murderer, who wore lizards in his hair, refused a
second one with regret, as he was due to be seen,
at a place some fifty miles away, within the
next five minutes. Ellis is the most extensively
seen and arrested man the writer has met.

Sydney Morning Herald, in an effort to
secure sympathy for the disconsolate Reid, thus
outrageously misrepresented facts in head line 3
spread across two columns in its leading page r
SCENE IN THE HOUSE.
MR. REID REFUSED A HEARING.
HE LEAVES THE CHAMBER.
Then follow six columns of Reid’s speech, and the
reader finding that Yes-No had been heard to the
bitter end would gape at the headings in astonish-
ment. But further on he would find that Reid
suddenly demanded that a Minister should stop
in the middle of a speech so that he (Reid) should
make another oration there and then; that one
private member objected (the objection of even
one member is fatal in such a case); that Reid
had to wait like an ordinary human being for his
chance to hold forth ; and that he boiled over and
departed. But for his girth and his eye-glass his
exit would have vaguely suggested Sultan Boabdil
el Chico leaving Granada, or the abdication of
Charles V., or the Old Guard charging 6s. Bd. at
Waterloo, or something.

The King has “ granted the privilege ” to
members of the first Federal Parliament that they
shall be entitled to use the title of honorable
on condition that the title should not be used or carry
with it any rank or precedence outside of Australia,
Which reminds The Bulletin, in a distant kind
of way, of a girl who wasn’t married but ought to
have been, and who begged her lord and master to
allow her to wear a wedding ring, just to pretend
to the other cats in the street. And he gave per
mission, stipulating that she was only to wear the'
ring in the house, where they both knew it didn’t
mean anything. And the lady felt there was no
satisfaction in that arrangement.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was the duty of the Melbourne Corporation to enable
the barrowmen to sell at low prices in the streets.
Although he was Premier he would never forget the men
with whom he started. (Hear, hear.) It was often said
he was “ only a cabbage grower.” He was always delighted
when he heard that remark. (Cheers.) Some people said
he was rather too rough on the public servants. But he
was as tender as water-cress. (Loud laughter.) The
pension list amounted to £375,000 a year—£looo a day.
“ Ye gods ! ” continued the Premier, “ what do you think
of that? (Laughter.) Ye who sell Jonathans at Is. 9d. !
(Laughter.)— Vic. Premier Bent at Doncaster.
Praise to the gods that gave us Bent,
Fountain of true nobility.
The zephyr that from heaven is sent
Blows sweeter when it kisses thee—
Oh rare caress !
Thy virtues like the dewdrops shine,
Illumining a wicked world,
Till men cling to thee as a vine—
Or slugs and snails to lettuce curled,
My Watercress !
Great Jove might envy thee thy power.
What cabbage hath a head like thine !
What cabbage—aye, what cauliflower !
Jove, could he see it, would resign,
His light put out.
Yet thou art tender as thou’rt great.
No lush and bloated raspberry
That squashes ’neath its neighbors’ weight
Could seem as soft as thou to me,
My Brussels Sprout.
Beneath thy breast a noble heart,
True, sound, and trusty to the core ;
Search any market-gardener’s cart,
Tomatoes you’ll not find with more,
Sweet rhubarb Bent.
And if it come to pluck and grit,
What radish can with thee compare ?
What melon is thy peer in wit,
What beetroot says “ I am as fair,
Magnificent ! ”
And then thy grace, O godlike Bent!
The fairies envy thee thy walk,
Nor manage its equivalent;
The pumpkin withers on its stalk—
So die all fops 1
There’s power and grace in every stride,
Jove joined to nimble Mercury ;
The rippling brook, the ocean’s tide,
The two in one, the two in thee,
My Turnip-tops.
So bring the crown, and put it on ;
Of onions let it be —for tears —
The meagre pittance going or gone
From them whose crime is weight of years ;
Or rue for bitterness.
And for thy sceptre let there be
A bunch of carrots held behind ;
Then shall thy subjects follow thee
And find thee soothing, gentle, kind
As sewer-grown watercress.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, May 24, 1904.
My Dear Abini
Sydney society gave so little proof of life during
the past week that I’m inclined to think it was
chloroformed. The only persons who didn’t
“take’’the anaesthetic were the Northcotes and
the Rawsons. The latter have a fairly “stiddy
job” (which is a quotation from the blacksmith
who was in love with the untidy, tired girl in a
Nat. Goodwin comedy) and consequently little
leisure. The former are amusing themselves and
feeding a horde of persons who have all got chefs
of their own. They took good advice, however,
about going to Katoomba and reviewing “ Lilian -
fels” (how the Japanese maples are all on fire
there amongst the sombre valley foliage) ! And
last Saturday they spent the day at National
Park. But someone else must have told them of
National Park.
The card of invitation to witness laying of
foundation-stone _by Lady Northcote of the new
Alexandra Hospital for Children intimates that
her Ex. will receive “purses” in aid of the good
work. “Purses” sounds very grand and mediaeval,
also it has its advantages. One of those long,
knitted, silk purses, holding five shillings’ worth
of coppers would make a good show in transit to
the lady, and provoke a guinea smile from her.
On the other hand, five sovs. going up under cover
might only get its giver a five-shilling smile. All
the same, you couldn’t expect a Governess-General
to hold out her palm for subscriptions, just like a
mere State Governor’s wife.
His Right Reverence the Bishop of Goulburn,
Dr. Barlow, who is a comely, young, and un-
married prelate, has shipped off to London for a
holiday from his adoring female parishioners. He
isn’t a boudoir ecclesiastic at all, and just wanted
to be left to his church and his study. But if
women go dotty over the curate, they cannot be
expected to keep an untottery intellect in the
presence of a bachelor bishop. And the Goulburn
ladies didn’t try. Report says that wild curates
and savage watchdogs slept on mats outside all the
street doors of the episcopal mansion as guards,
lest his reverence should be proposed to through
the keyhole in the silent hours, or have love letters
inserted in at his bedroom window on a long fish-
ing-rod. Bishop Barlow will probably bring back
a wife with a long rigid spine and a lot of money,
and so divert from himself the artistic prostra-
tions of the ewe lambs of his flock.
The unofficial wife of a certain titled Australian
(he did not take her with him on his last cruise)
was lately about Sydney in a unique get-up. A short
fawn skirt—so short as to lie quite 12 inches off
the road—fitted her so tightly at the back and
followed the lines so closely as to give her a
mermaid outline. She held her sable muff very
low and her chin very high, and from her fair hair
to her shoes of many straps she was a joy to the
mossifaces.
Four women, the eldest no more mature than
the prime of life, tall as to stature, generous as to
development (not one of them has a saucer-shaped
depression or catchment area below her collar-
bone) ; four women moving as easily over the
stage as the seagulls in Middle Harbor, beauti-
fully gowned with trailing clouds of flower-toned
trains—trains that swirl and swathe and billow as
their respective wearers turn to speak the loving
word or the conventional good night, or merely turn
for art’s sake to make a picture on a staircase !
These four women are Susie Vaughan, Mabel
Lane, May Chevalier and Olga 8.-Kingston, and
their ascents and descents of the staircase in
“Raffles,” the new play at Her Majesty’s, make
an emotion and a moral. The emotion is un-
qualified admiration of the undulating, leopard-
like grace of the comings and goings. I haven’t
got the moral ready.
Miss Vaughan, as Lady Melrose, gowned in
white satin—its white gleam softened with misty,
black drapings, and on her neck the diamond
necklace which her distinguished guest steals—
says good night and loads the way up the crimson-
carpeted steps below the portraits of ruffled,
sworded and love-locked ancestors. Next follows
her guest, Mrs. Vidal (Miss Lane), seething with
jealousy, in a robe—l once saw a flying fish just
the color of that robe, but I can’t give the robe’s
hue or the fish’s complexion a name. A
girl in the audience told me the dress was
a bright shrimp pink (how truly awful !).
Another said it was like some nasturtiums.
Thirdly floated up the stairs the youthful Lady
Ethel (Miss Kingston) in draperies non-committal
as to color—pale straw, or cream, perhaps; and
fourthly, after her went the Lord’s ward (Miss
Chevalier) shining in sky-dyed silk cunningly
fashioned to spread out in great fan-like pleats
around the tootsies that so many men desired to
kiss. Now I’ve got them, all four on the stairway,
and they make a gracious picture; then the three
upper figures vanish one by one into darkness, and
the girl in the forget-me-not blue silk pauses, turns,
droops for an instant towards the man looking up
at her, then she, too, drifts out of ken.
Some Japanese garbing was apparent amongst
the first night audiences both at “ Raffles ” and
“Lady Kitty.” There were two theatre coats
(not worn by neighboring sitters either) on
the kimono plan, and of materials that
bore, in the one case, what looked like
eels doing a wild wriggle, and in the other
chrysanthemums doing a wild sprawl. Another
lady had her hair dressed with tea-caddy
picturesqueness. Talking of hair-dressing: that
ball in aid of the Consumptive Sanitaria will have
one capital side-attraction for galleryites. They
are to guess (for a prize presented by Mrs. J. C.
Williamson) what characters in history or fiction
are represented by the hair-dressing down below.
I he historical or legendary dancer will do her best
to betray her alias by her hair-dressing or head
dress only. The rest of her will be 1904. For
instance, when you see me at the ball with a fire-
man’s helmet on my tightly-screwed hair you’ll
know I’m Boadicea.
Bland Holt driving a smart little cart about
town is a good sight these cold days. His handling
of the fiery lamb in the shafts is masterly.
A Melbourne friend sends me a portrait of an
uncommonly beautiful girl, May Fairclough, who
is said to be playing good parts at St. James’s
Theatre, London. The girl, who is a Victorian,
born at St. Hilda, is the daughter of a once well-
known Australian singer, Elsa May, and of
Boothroyd Fairclough, who had considerable
vogue as a tragedian some 25 years ago. Eugenie
Legrand, who afterwards became the wife of
Hector Wilson, a Victorian squatter, came out
with Fairclough as his leading lady. This is the
artiste who was previously married to Kyrle
Bellew. Fairclough, his wife (who is also a Mel-
bournienne), and their daughter left Melbourne
some years ago. He had been giving lessons in
elocution for some time, but as he threw away his
art at the rate of a guinea a lesson he wasn’t
rushed with pupils.
There are milk-vendors about Sydney suburbs
who are quite as insanitary in appearance
as the professional domain dosser. Lately,
whilst waiting for a tram in a third - rate
suburb, I watched a boy milk-seller serve a
wandering customer. He put the cover of his
can on the dirty crowded side-walk whilst he
ladled. It left a milky rim in the dust, and no
doubt took up a few germs. Then he got into a
cart about as clean as a garbage waggon, and
drawn by a horse that didn’t look as if it had been
groomed since it was foaled.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“The Sydenham Clarkes, by latest advices,
have been renewing confidences with Melba.
Little Miss Clarke—the ewe lamb of the correct
grey pair—is still having her voice trained in the
way it should go, somewhere in Paris. Melba,
by the way, now values her Saxonia losses (you
remember a pipe leaked into her cabin and washed
a considerable stock of treasures out of the port-
hole) at £6OOO. And the shipping co. makes up
its case slowly. The lost fans Melba frets for
most. These, she said, were of all ages, and not
to be replaced. The music-scores are another
source of woe. Melba stormily declares there was
so much lost that she can’t recall all to memory.
And the co. must make good even the unremem-
bered things—or the diva will know the reason
why.
“ The going of the Bulky-Johnsons has caused
Toorak to put on its considering cap. The Bulky
seemed plumply and pinkishly pleased with
things till his long interesting mate came along
and viewed her new environment through an
ebony lorgnette. She took Melbourne’s fancy,
however little Melbourne took hers. Society cir-
culated that Mrs.- Bulky-Johnson was a first-
cousin of the fair Langtry. This increased inte-
rest in the graceful, beautifully-tinted blonde with
the clear sparkle as of frost in her roving eye.
And now the Bulkies have gone. They took ship
for ’Frisco, and make for the St. Louis Fair.
“ The Block charmer who was ready to fall on
the bosom of Maurice Farkoa, has discovered that
the dear one takes his substantial braised steak at
a Collins-street cafe, that he has a large, active
appetite, and that his front grey lock is a quiet, dull,
ineffective matter by daylight as it looks down on
a large, massive steak (braised). Maurice may put
a lot of sugary emotion into his ‘ Kiss ’ duet every
night, but off the boards he doesn’t philander, he
doesn’t ogle, he doesn’t play the ‘ Block ’ games.
He just eats steak in a healthy and manly fashion
and lets his grey forelock hang anyhow.
“At the Federal House on Wednesday Sir
Reggie Talbot and Aide Fitzpatrick disembarked
from a plain, massive, green and orange motor
that had whirled them in from their remote quar-
ters. Several showers had enlivened the trip, and
the rims of the two tall hats were as flooded
gutters. Some hats hold fully a pint in the rim.
But the pair dripped up the steps to the House
stolidly and, refusing to be hung out to dry, sat
their damp selves down for four hours to hear
Premier Watson voice his good intentions.
“To the she-visitors of the Federal gallery the
extravagant willingness of Mr. Alfred Deakin
to oblige opponent or partisan becomes a cause
of irritation. His constant nod of agreeability in
reference moments gets on the nerves, aud one
feels inclined to smack hard the neighbor (a
casual at the House) who keeps up a train of
admiring ejaculations at the Deakin attitude of
good _ boy. When leader Watson occasionally
fell into referring to the Prime Minister, last
Wednesday, Alfred Deakin would, with sugared
sweetness, lean forward and unostentatiously (as
it were) murmur ‘ Ex.’
“It was surprising to find the fashionable
element in such strength at the first sitting of the
Democratic Government. And they rushed early
seats. ‘House full’ quoth the officials at an
unadvanced hour, and even then Mrs. I. Isaacs,
and Mrs. Landale, in handsome upholsterings, had
to be accommodated in the small pen behind the
chair of the Speaker. As Mrs. Isaacs assumed
a Madame Recamier attitude of ease (as far as the
chair exigencies permitted) the Gallery eye of the
fashionables found something to dwell upon after
a long view of the plain sac-coated Government.
“Feminine connoisseurs aver that a beardless
Watson would look very youthful. Doubtless.
The boyish expression of face and figure is un-
deniable, and a fresh and earnest impulse of speech
give the lie to the elderly beard.
“Mrs. Norman Armytage has gone with her
husband to Bananaland. The decline in the wool
clip lately affected the lady’s fortune. However,
she showed pluck, took a small cottage in Sand-
ringham, and ironed the children’s pinnies in a
highly becoming manner—the manner of a Grand
Duchess in exile. Some Toorak teas were ten-
dered as a farewell to Mrs. Armytage last month.
“An interesting feature of the Marmora’s de-
parture last week was the sealing of bullion. The
precious stuff, stored in rough wooden boxes (the
land the pudding-basin is usually packed in), re-
ceived the wax impress in a ridiculously apathetic
fashion. Two or three bank officials stood round,
hands in pockets. Officers told of how impres-
sively the gold is landed at Colombo and other
ports, its revolvered escort, and its ceremonious
change of hands. At the Westralian port the
officials stand with the business end of the fire-
arms not far from one’s nose, and the Force forms
a square with artillery at each corner and cavalry
• 1 the flanks, or something like that. I even
fancy some one wears a cocked hat. But there is
just as much emotional stress in the branding of
the bullion at Melbourne’s Port as if it were
chilled rabbit.
“ The audience that crowded to Judge
A Beckett’s Breach of Promise entertainment at
Melbourne Law Courts last week got a few solemn
lessons and some amusement for its trouble. The
case was _ quite a family matter, all interested
parties being of the Chosen race. Plaintiff, a tall,
dark, desirable damsel of 22, came from Russia to
Leeds (Yorkshire) some four years ago, and after
putting in a little time as a tailoress in Leeds —at
12s. a week for from 12 to 16 hours per day—was
imported into Australia by cousin Nathan Harris,
so she swore, under contract to marry him. (Seeing
that she got work in Harris’ factory immediately
on arrival at 245. 6d. a week for eight hours’ work
the damsel is herself a charming piece of evidence
of the beauties of Protection). The prospective
bride admitted that Nathan had bought her no
presents but a sixpenny string of beads, and that
she could name nobody who had seen them walk-
ing out together because when they thus went
a-philandering ‘ she was always looking at
Nathan.’ This simple little tale was flatly con-
tradicted by various cousins, aunts and what-nots
—rinostly named Cohen or Harris or Woolf or
Goldman—but the fascination of a pair of fine,
dark eyes evidently told on the jury and plaintiff
got £lOO of the £5OO she asked for.
“It is possible that Scherek of the woolly mane
may set up in London in the impresario business.
Benno hates teaching, and it has grown more
irksome since visiting stars have petted him here
and in S’Africa. To go back to chromatic scales
and adoring, callow pupils after that is not an
alluring prospect.
“One result of the overthrow of the Deakin
Ministry was the sudden return of the men thus
freed from office to their old domestic habits.
George Turner began at once to oust the slugs
from his Hawthorn garden, and Alfred Deakin
enticed his wife from her high-walled eyrie to long
walks over the Toorak quarter.
“ One. bold little society dame has absolutely
vetoed introductions in her house. You must
‘ mash ’ your girl or perish, unless you happen to
know one beforehand. It’s a risky thing to try
and get an unintroduced party into swing.
Authorised mashing, like the complaisant kiss,
has neither flavor nor charm.
'A plucky little Frenchwoman (resident in
Melbourne) who issued a book on the gardening
art as a pot-boiler, and realised a fair sale, is now
doing well as a landscape gardener. She keeps
a staff of men in her employment, and merely
directs and supervises. She does not squash the
hairy caterpillar with her own fair hands, or per-
sonally hunt down the rose bug.
“ A Melbourne man refuses to learn bridge. * I
do not play,’ lie says. ‘Do not seek to rob me of
my only distinction.’
“A gladsome event ahead is the opening of the
new hospital operating theatre by Governor Tal-
bot’s wife. Malcolm M‘Eacharn’s dame has cir-
culated cards, and a cheerful tea is due after a
preliminary peep at the butchery department,
and the guests, as they munch over the seed
cake, can muse of appendicitis and the com-
forts of the operating table.
“ Collins-street lost its most venerable and
longest-known dandy last week—Mr. Peter
Henderson, an ancient with snow-hair hanging in
the distaff fashion, and a pair of sharp eyes look-
ing out vigilantly under their grey-fringed mantels.
In the nineties he attended town every day, and
flourished as well-fitting a coat as any of the Block
juveniles. He never forgot that he had been
naturally endowed as a ‘ killer ’; that his French
wife had been a charming member of a sex he had
done homage to all his life ; and that his six sons
were forging ahead in various professions. Life
had been good to him, and his good-humor
abounded to the last.
“Westralia is the paradise of the she-golfer.
A Melb. player writes of her joy at the novel con-
dition of things out West. The first day she men-
tioned _ golf in a mixed assemblage, five male
enthusiasts rushed to issue an immediate invita-
tion to the links. The next day ten were ready to
escort her to the ‘ driving tee.’ Invitations still
descend upon her head, and the golfing jersey is
in constant wear.
“Distributing prizes for St. John Ambulance
Association in Melbourne, recently, His Waxcel-
lency let his gallantry go. Being apparently
drowned, he said, he would reckon as one of the
1 distinguished pleasures of life ’ if only the sweet,
blushing, young girl ambulancers he saw before
him were there to bring him back to life and meet
his returning consciousness with a sweet smile.
But would the sweet young thing smile when she
beheld the Chief Justice outside his tapes and
whalebones, and with the beautiful moustache
unwaxed and limp, and hanging like two depressed
dogs’-tails ?
(Continued on page 25.)
6. H. Prendergast, one of Victoria’s best
Labor advocates, has given that very blood-thirsty
Christian person Fitchett a good bump. Fitchett
is part owner and editor of the Southern Cross,
a little Wesleyan rag, and in it he accused Pren-
dergast of being responsible for an anti-religious
article that appeared in the Tocsin. He further
asserted that Prendergast was editor of the
Tocsin, and that all sane and decent people
should vote against him in North Melbourne at
the election. Prendergast informed Fitchett that
he was not responsible for the anti-religious article
in question and was not editor of the Tocsin, and
threatened Fitchett with an action at law.
Fitchett, who has made such a lot of money out of
florifying fights, was not taking any fight with
’rendergast, so in the next issue of the Southern
Cross he climbed down, and referred to
Prendergast as “an able, earnest and influential
leader of the Labor movement.”
G. H. Reid, in the House of Reps., the
other night:—
I have pursued from boyhood a life of perfect truth and
consistency on the subject which has dominated the
politics of Australia for 30 years. Have I ever changed on
it ? Have I ever betrayed it ? Did I not fulfil my trust in
my hour of power ? Did I then put forward a milk-and-
water programme to attract support? Noll immediately
came forward with the radical policy of my life. I
attached myself to Freetrade and land taxation.
Yet what an awful lot of things the perfectly
truthful and consistent Freetrade George protected
all the time he was in office ! He “attached him-
self” to Freetrade and Land-taxation, and both
the betrayed females had to support themselves
by taking in washing.
In addition to being an ass, the Law in
many cases is a monstrous iniquity. Justice
Hodges, in Victoria, has called attention to a
brutal state of affairs supported by the existing
code. The mother of an illegitimate child by the
late Roady Carew, of Warrnambool, sued the
executors of his estate for £554, arrears on a main-
tenance order which she obtained against Roady
during his lifetime. The woman lost the case,
and Justice Hodges pointed out that, even where
it had been unmistakably proved that a man was
the father of an illegitimate child, and was well
able to maintain it, the maintenance of that child
might be thrown on the State or on charity if the
father happened to die while the child was still un-
able to maintain itself. That is barbarous enough
in all conscience, but Hodges seems to have over-
looked the fact that the law permits a still worse
piece of brutality. There is nothing to stop a
wealthy man willing away the whole of his pro-
perty from his legitimate children, and thereby
throwing them upon the State or the charities.
This is one of the concessions that the law has
always made to the property-owner. As it was
nearing election time when Hodges made refer-
ence to this matter, Bent immediately began
making promises to amend the law. If some one
does not tie Bent up to a big Gippsland tree he
will soon have promised to outrage all the sacred
rights of property as known to the existing law.
AT POVERTY POINT.
A M.L. suggestion is that the Government should
oblige managers of outside theatrical co’s. to put up a
sum of money as guarantee for salaries before allowing
them to play in Maoriland. Slips are inevitable, but
numbers of managers carry a troupe across the Tasman
Sea, and leave it to the Maorilanders to send the members
back. The managers come back on their own, and set
cheerily about enlisting another team.
As an encore at a Sydney suburban concert last week a
performer attempted to chatter “The Absent-minded
Beggar.” But times had changed, and floor-scraping and
hissing put the doggerel to sudden death.
The following is told of Rignold when playing Shak
speare in his palmy days in Sydney. He was rehearsing
the mechanical contrivance for producing the thunder
ejects in “ Julius Caesar.” The artificial clap didn’t
satisfy George’s idea of thunder, and he sent for the stage
mechanist. “ That thunder won’t do,” he said ; “ it’s
not sufficiently realistic.” The mechanist humbly ex-
plained that the peal was not the work of human shall, as
the elements were just then producing the real effect.
“ Well, it won’t do,” said the actor-manager; “ it’s not
my idea of thunder. It may be good enough for the
Almighty, but, damn it —it’s not good enough for George
Rignold ! ”
Eva Quinn, who is getting a chance with the Knight-
Jeffries co., is a sister of Ada Guildford, impersonator of
many a long-suffering heroine and an occasional adven-
turess in Andersonian melodrama. Miss Guildford re-
cently became Mrs. W. J. F. Mount.
When theatrical co.’s strike Kalgoorlie, the miner and
his best girl ruffle it with the toniest of “ society” in the
front rows. One or two of Pollard’s comic operas were
rather long drawn out, and the miners would have to get
up before the finish to gird on their bowyangs in time for
night shift at the mine.
Wilson Barrett’s new drama of Australian interest,
styled “The Never Never Land,” appears to be a very
inferior play of its type, as well as a lurid libel on this
country. All the sin and wickedness in the story is
allotted to three Australian-born blackmailers who have
followed the erring hero to dear old England. One
villain is “Raphael Moses Wolff, a Sydney solicitor.”
Barrett would naturally be struck by the numerousness
of Wolffs in legal circles hereabouts, but did he take the
trouble to assure himself that there wasn’t a Raphael
Moses among them ?
Mrs. Langtry, who comes this way in June next year, is
the godmother of a ’Murkan town christened Langtry by
the leading local lunatic. The most important building
in the town is a Jersey Lily Saloon, where the inhabitants
drink to the memory of her intoxicating charms. The
memory is getting ancient, but the whisky is new enough.
S.M. Herald (19/5/’0I) contained an advt.: —
TV ANTED, ARTISTS willing to assist Concert in aid
'' of the Animals of the Zoological Gardens to send
their names to
17, Herald Office.
Look at it as one may, it is a crying shame that what is,
or ought to be, an educational establishment should be
allowed to go to the dogs while money can be found for
arches and decorations to celebrate the visit of a Governor
in whom nobody takes any interest. The Zoo lion is
much more really interesting than the Governor ; yet the
Governor gets an arch and a reception and a banquet,
while the lion gets a scanty piece of dead ‘bus-horse
thrown with a bounce and a whack on the floor of his
residence.
Arthur Roberts, the burlesque comedian, has produced
a nonsense play in London entitled “ The Darling of the
Guards” in which the principal song is “Under the
Beerbohm Tree.”

PERSONAL ITEMS.
British Government has agreed “to
consider” the matter of Witton’s release when
he has served three years—that is one year from
now. Probably he will be released then.
W. J. Lyne crossed the Rubicon of 60
years last month. In all his quarter of a century
of Parliamentary life, office was never so irri-
tatingly evasive and difficult to lay for as in the
present Donnybrook of parties.
Rev. George Walters, of Sydney Unitarian
Church, married Premier Watson to his present
wife 14 years ago. Mrs. Watson, a pleasant
gentlewoman, close to Mrs. Edmund Barton in
appearance, has not yet come forward to share her
husband’s honors.
A son of the late John Hancock, the
Melbourne Labor member, had a son born to him
on Eight Hours’ Day, April 21st, last year. The
child died. This year a successor came to town
on April 25th, the Monday appointed for Eight
Hours holiday and procession.
According to the London Gazette, the
British War Office has now to the credit of the
late Harry Morant (“ The Breaker”) £123 6s. Id.
Are there any persons in Australia entitled to
claim the amount, or will it ultimately go to the
British Government to defray the cost of execu-
tion?
Rev. Samuel Day, retired from the Particu-
lar Baptist ministry in Victoria at 94, has had 70
years of service as clergyman of that sect, and 41
years of the 70 were put in at Geelong. Geelong
is the place where the visitor pinches himself to
ascertain if he is really alive, and often finds that
he isn’t.
Old Jules Joubert is determined to have
his final flutter in exhibition management at
Sydney, and is shaking the Melbourne dust off his
feet. Joubert is a wonderful man, full of vitality
at the age of 80. He was born at Angouffime, and
landed from a French man-of-war in Sydney 65
years ago.
Peter Henderson, railway engineer, who
died, the other day, at Glenferrie (Vic.), aged 90,
was apprenticed to George Stephenson, and
remembered seeing the first train run from Stock-
ton to Darlington. At one time he was engaged
in railway building in N.S.W., having lived in
Australia since the ’so’s.
It takes some people a long while to fully
realise their injuries. Dr. Leith Napier, onetime
surgeon-major in S.A. military forces, was, in
January, 1900, thrown from his horse while on his
way to join the military encampment at Marino,
and seriously injured. Now in 1904 he is claiming
*6500 damages from the Jenkins Government.
Jenkins doesn’t seem to be having any, and the
matter will shortly come before the court.
SENATOR STEWART, OF QUEENSLAND
Guy Madden, the Waxcellency’s son, is a
youth of many parts. When papa appears on the
stage as Lieut.-Governor, Guy is gorgeous in
kilts, sporran, porridge and other Scotch plumage
as Captain Guy, A.D.C. Recently, during the
temporary absence of Barlow, Guy donned black
gown and white bands and posed as pa’s Judicial
Associate.
Among the names of re-instated railway
strikers—a list of whom was published in the
Victorian Government Gazette lately—occurs
that of William George Bent, of Brighton, cleaner
at from 4s. to 6s. a day. The directory gives only
tit 6 ™ Brighton, and doesn’t mention any
Wm. George anywhere. Which of Thomas’s
relatives struck?
Some people get good returns for their
work in Melbourne. The four men who took on
the blasting job at the E., S. and A. branch bank,
Box Hill, netted £5OO each. It is about 40 years
since a branch of the E., S. and A. was stuck up.
De Gruchy, who defended the bank’s treasure at
hitzroy, has retired on a pension and on his
reputation as a hero.
Old T. S. Reed, secretary of Adelaide
Geographical Society, who completed his 86th
year on May 23, won a bronze medal, of which he
is very proud, at the London Exhibition of 1851
for a silk-weaving loom which he had invented.
He was then in business in London. He came to
Australia a few years later as the only chance of
saving his life, then threatened by lung disease.
Zionist preacher Voliva has more pluck
than his master, “Elijah” Dowie. In the
Sunday scrimmage at Melbourne Zion Taber-
nacle, Voliva took off his coat in the middle of
the service and went down on the floor of the
house light into the thick of the fight, proving
hitnseli an expert chucker-out. Voliva was a
lawyer in the United States before he became
converted and began to use language that no
judge would have tolerated.
Ever since there was
constitutional govern-
ment in Westralia, Fre-
mantle has been repre-
sented by “Jack” Higham
—good-natured and harm-
less, and popular enough
in the refreshment-room
to be Government whip.
He was born in Fre-
mantle, and married into
the wealthy Bateman
family. Old Bateman
is also a Groper, having
lived for more than 70
years in Fremantle —
founded in 1829. He
traded in rum, old
anchors, spars, sails, sea
biscuits, damaged to-
bacco —a nyth i n g that
skippers had to sell or
that the sea washed up.
One of his sons is at the
head of the business,
now one of the most extensive in the West.
It is generally believed in the West that lie
sits behind a million at least. A determined
effort was made to get a new man to stand for
Fremantle this election, but Jack Higham’s
friends worked the National Political Ass to select
him, and it will be a straight go between the
sitting member and Needham, the Labor man.
Alick Kethel, M.L.C., off to Europe and
America chiefly on timber business, promises to
be back in Sydney at next kilted gathering.
Alick’s one indulgence in disloyal language was
when Governor Duff declined to put on Lilts at
the Highland spree. What made the offence
worse was that Duff was the first N. S. W. Governor
from the land o’ cakes since the days of Macquarie.
Two simultaneous telegrams to a Sydney
paper from Hobart: —
Mr. W. Dodery has been elected President of the Legis-
lative Council, vice Mr. Adye Douglas.
The Government Statistician claims to have a piece of
tree found in Southern Tasmania which, he says, is from
15 to 20 million years old.
And no one recognised it as the sudden discovery
of the material that Dodery’s head was made of.
J. 0. Lorraine, Broken Hill’s first broker,
has just left the silver field for the West. He 17
years ago reared a tent and hung out his signboard
where a leading bank now stands in the main
street, and has carried on a fluctuating business
within a stone’s throw ever since. Although
Lorraine passed through the Hill’s best times, he
leaves just about as well off as when he arrived —
which isn’t saying very much.
A Yan Diemen’s Land pioneer, who had
nearly completed the century, died at Ballarat
(Vic.), on Sunday, 15th, in her 96th year.
Mrs. E. Amos arrived in Hobart Town by
the ship Greenock in 1826, and was married
in old St. David’s, Hobart, in 1833. In 1826
Governor Arthur ruled in V.D.L., and the Rev.
William, “the fighting chaplain,” was minister at
St. David’s.
Malcolm M'Eacham, with his wife and
family, are going to Hingland for ever —so it is
reported. Never again, says the knight of
“Goathlands,” will he take an interest in Aus-
tralia, except in the sense that he will watch from
Mayfair the dividends earned by his ships in Aus-
tralian waters. The black ingratitude of the
country that elected Maloney is sharper than a
serpent’s tooth, and it has bitten Malcolm in a
place where he can’t get at the injury even by
taking off his clothes.
Quite a number of Australian Labor mem-
bers sit behind a very respectable pile, Page and
King O’Malley being probably among the most
affluent. The Labor party, as a whole, is more
generally solvent than any other and has a big
stake in the country. Some of the Oppositionists
have appalling overdrafts, and the aggregate
financial condition of about two-thirds of them is
blank insolvency. Yet they profess to be the
Stake-in-the-Country party.
Sydney Kidman, the Cattle King, was in
Sydney last April. Adelaide Register sent a
representative with the “king” right through his
tour, but in Sydney he wasn’t even interviewed.
Kidman is a healthy, middle-sized, middle-aged,
dark man with black, shimmering eyes that reflect
the gleaming horns of mighty mobs of oattle.
He hates telegraphing about business, although he
probably reoeives more telegrams from all over
Cattleland than any other Australian. He never
smokes, drinks, or swears, and takes his wife with
him everywhere he goes.
Hanged at Fremantle gaol (W.A.) re-
cently, one Mynoor, an Afghan, for murdering a
countryman. Mynoor was given leave to be
jerked off to Mahomet in all his Afghan finery..
According to the newspapers :
The tunic was of bright green silk, the trousers of
Assam silk of fine texture, the socks colored and striped,
in keeping with the remainer of the clothing, and the
headgear conical in shape and of good quality.
This looked right enough until the fanciful head-
gear had to be taken off, to allow the adjustment
of the white cap. Then Mynoor looked as if
arrayed for a fancy dress football match.
A BLIGHTING- ACCUSATION
No. 1: “ What were you saying against me to
Fitz ? ”
No. 2: “ Against you! Not a word! Why, I told
him you were my mother!”
It seems that “Bleeds that Won the
Empire” Fitchett prepares his sermons in exactly
the same way that he writes leading articles and
books. When invited by the Argus to say how
he prepared his sermons, Fitchett innocently
remarked
When a subject is chosen, or rather has chosen me, I
read, if I have time, everything I have in my study bear-
ing on it. I want to know the best things that have been
said or thought on that particular topic by the wisest
minds within my reach.
Are those “best things” then fired off as Fitchett’s
very own ?
Masonry (a Victorian paper), of May 12,
grovels in a leading article to the Order’s local
High Panjandrum, Peacock, and expresses joy on
behalf of
every member of the Order who must feel sincere satis-
faction that the Royal Commission appointed to inquire
into charges of bribery in which the Most Worshipful
the Grand Master of Victoria was involved, has com-
pletely exonerated him so that no stain of dishonor
attaches to his name.
Another illustration of the fact that there is
nothing like an injudicious friend for making
things uncomfortable for a man.
The Arcadian Cole, despite his strange en-
thusiasm for a Black and Yellow Australia, is not
wildly illusioned on the subject. In his latest
circular to friendly cranks Cole remarks that
the White Australia Act “will have to be
much talked about, discussed and thought
out before it will be either judiciously
modified or repealed.” The spectacle of
Cole waiting patiently for this country
to be converted by his pro-Chow
pamphlets is somewhat pathetic as
regards the kindly old bookseller, and
very amusing as regards his business.
Cole’s latest fad is the crowning
advt. of his respectable career, and
has given a new significance to the old
sign of the rainbow with which his
name is identified in Melbourne. The
rainbow is now taken as a symbol of
Cole’s dream of a colored Common-
wealth.
A N.S.W. political publican is said to "
employ a literary man, at fair average journalistic
pay, not only to write out letters and speeches, but
to supply him with correct views on current hap-
penings.
Notable how familiarity has not bred con-
tempt in Australian politics. Politicians who
have been known by abbreviated front names
“Charlie” Kingston, late “Billy” Browne
“Andy” Dawson, “Chris” Watson, &c., &c.—in
every case the familiarity expressed affection and
respect. The men for whom contempt is felt get
a nick-name, such as “Yes-bio” Reid, or are
“sirred” derisively.
A notable person recently bore witness in
N.S.W. Arbitration Court—“ Butty ” M ‘Mahon,
carrier, of the remarkable buggy, the worried
cantering horse, and the old, squat, blue suit.
His breezy simplicity, and his entire absence of
unhealthy “dog,” stamped him as a self-made
man unspoilt by pelf. His figure is the nearest
approach to “as broad as it’s long” that can be
imagined. The Arbitration Court, which is said
to be fiendishly driving capital out of this
unfortunate country, does its deeds in
a somewhat sleepy, sad fashion. Judge
Cohen is always alert, but both Sam Smith and
Cruickshank appear as if just aroused from a
deep sleep. M‘Mahon woke up this tired public
authority. He got the first start along the road to
wealth drawing copper ore at Clermont (Q.). Now
he has Sydney’s chief carrying trade, owns about
300 turn-outs each valued at £5O, possesses two
stations valued at £40,000, is suspected of owning
numerous terraces, and is the president of the
Sydney Master Carriers’ Association.
“F.C.”: As to Mr. Ni Gan, solicitor, of
Bendigo, he has a compatriot in Wm. Ah Ket, of
Melbourne, who gets himself retained considerably
by the Lilly Buck-stleet Chows, and was rushed
with fees during the Chinkie strike. He was also
counsel for the two remarkable youths who lately
took a baby from its girl-mother and deposited it
one cold night on the -banks of the Merri Creek.
I have also a dim recollection of an Ah Mouy, a
solicitor, pervading Melbourne about ’92, but can
find no record of him.
J. H. Angas (S.A.), who died last week,
ag( J 81, arrived in the State in September, 1813,
just before he completed his 20th year, his mission
being to “look after the affairs of his father in
the new colony, to examine and develop the large
tract of country purchased by Mr. Flaxman (his
father’s agent), and to undertake such measures as
would tend to retrieve the fallen fortunes of the
family.” The affairs of his father, George Fife
Angas, as well as those of S.A., were, indeed, in
confusion. Governor George Grey managed to
rehabilitate the State finances and to put S. A. on
the road to prosperity, and Angas did. the same
for his father. The old man died in 1879, aged
90, worth over a million; two daughters died
worth from £300,000 to £400,000 each, and now
the son has died, one of the wealthiest men in the
Commonwealth.
Two Hebrew nonagenarians, who died in
Melbourne on May 15, left numerous grand-
children and great grand-children. In one case,
that of Louis B. Josephson, most of his children
had pre-deceased him, whilst he lived on to ponder
over family history like Zola’s old woman who
brought into the world the Rougon-Maequarb
family. Two of Josephson’s dead sons-in-law
were noted men in Melbourne. Aaron Waxman,
who invented the “H. Order” for Victorian
civil servants, during the Darling-grant dead-
lock, was killed by a spirited trotter in a buggy
accident. The other son-in-law, Moses Goldstein,
who proved a failure as a money-lender and lost
all his wealth, cut his throat with a razor. The
other deceased ancient was the widow of Rev.
Solomon Phillips, who many years ago officiated
as Jewish Rabbi in Sydney. She was the mother
of many sons and daughters, the best-known of
whom is P. D. Phillips, the solicitor and
Shakspearian scholar. Fox, the artist, whose
“Landing of Captain Cook” is on the walls of
the Melbourne National Gallery, is a grandson of
the deceased Mrs. Phillips.
A GOOD WRITER.
PROPRIETOR OF COUNTRY RAG (seldom sober
enough to take charge): “ Where the deuce
did this tripe come from that you've set up
for this week's leader?"
FOREMAN (proudly): “ That was wrote by a friend
of mine—a prize writer. I arst him to spread
himself. You can't tell his hand-writin' from
copper-plate printin' when he really spreads
himself."
George Kerr follows Airey, successor to
“Billy” Browne, as leader of Queensland Labor
party in the Assembly. Kerr, who sits for
Barcoo, came in with the first flood of Laborites,
and has battled hard and kept the seat ever since.
Like “Billy” Browne, he got a good deal of his
Radicalism at Croydon, where even the lawyers
are Radicals ; then went into business at Tambo.
He is a steady, reliable goer. Queensland, for one
reason and another, has had an unusual number of
changes in its Labor leadership—Glassey, in a
sense Plumper Hoolan, Dawson, Browne, Airey,
and now Kerr. S. Australia has had three
leaders—M'Pherson (whose dying message, “Tell
the boys to stick together,” has since been the
S.A. party’s motto), Batchelor and Prioe. The
N.S. Wales party has had M‘Gowen all through.
The S.A. party has, in all its years, had but two
seceders, Charleston and Wood, both now out of
Parliament.
HEAVY COLDS.
Pale, weak people whose hands and feet are chill for want of rich, red blood, always catch cold. Their
lungs are soft and moist —the heart can’t send out blood enough to make them sound and strong. Then comes
the cold and cough, racking the poor frail frame and tearing the tender lungs. And the cold turns to pneu-
monia, influenza, consumption or bronchitis—a lingering illness or a swifter death. Now Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills are the best tonic in the world for these ailments. The rich red blood they actually make heals and
strengthens weak and tender lungs, and banishes forever heavy colds and the deadly ills they bring.
“ I caught a heavy cold through being out in the wet,” says Mrs. K. Pirnie, Sorrell-street, Parramatta, Sydney, “and soon
it turned to Influenza. Aching pains came in my back, shoulders and limbs. I lay a helpless prey to heavy, thumping
splitting headaches. I could not eat and, of course, rapidly grew thin and weak. I felt hot and feverish and had dreadful
pains at the back of my eyes. After six weeks of aches and feverishness I left bed and could only get across the room by hold-
ing on to furniture. There was such a dreadful weakness in my legs that I could not stand. And my head used to
swim round and round. If I even moved my eyes, something used to start jumping in my head and I would have to lie down
again. I had a nasty hollow cough and my chest was sore and tender. The least exertion would tire me out and set my heart
thumping. The doctor treated me but I made very slow headway. At last I read that Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People
were a splendid medicine for building one up, because they actually made new blood, which strengthened every part of the
body. I sent for three boxes to Washington Soul’s and in a week I was a lot better. They braced me up wonderfully. Every
day after that I grew stronger and ate better. My head and back stopped aching and iny legs lost that weak, shaky feeling.
Three boxes fixed me up altogether, how lam as well as ever I was. My lungs are so strong- that I never catch cold, even
though Igo out in the Winter’s wet. I have proved that Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People do really make rich red blood
which creates a splendid appetite and makes you quite bright and strong.”

AN UNWILLING BACKSLTDER, OR THE
VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCE.
JAMES: Elio! what's this 1 I thought you was
never goin’ to touch it again.”
WILLIAM: “ Neither I was. Fact ish, lan'lord
was drunk at the pub, no one was in sharge
of the bar—it was forced on me !”
The picturesque Maori’s rebuke :
Complaints having 1 been made that a wire stretched
across the Wanganui River by the natives for the purpose
of carrying firewood was a danger to navigation, the
Harbor Board instructed its secretary to write the natives
asking them to remove it. The following characteristic
letter was received by the Board in reply : “ Greetings !
I have received your letter concerning the wire for cross-
ing goods from Rakato on the Wanganui River, and asking
chat it be taken down. The wire has been down nearly
three months. On the other hand, I should like to ex-
plain to you that the steamer could not reach the wire if
it went during a flood ; and further, a steamer could not
steam against such a flow as to allow it to touch the wire.
That is all.—From your friend, Hoani Timuaki.’*

“ Wallaroo ” : Drunks aren’t in it for luck
with reckless well-sinkers. Know one who has
experienced three windlass collapses. First time
it was merely a fright-and-language affair. Then
he acquired a broken head—the bucket hit it.
Afterwards he was smitten by the whole show—
bucket, windlass, and sundries —the lot falling a
depth of 30ft. They stuffed his remains with
wadding, and, after many months, started him
Sydneywards to be relieved of a quantity of posts
and galvanised iron that were embedded in his
constitution.
Ne’er-do-Weel ” : There were plenty of
aboriginals to be seen in the streets of Brisbane 20
years ago. They were perfectly under control,
were never seen drunk, and used to be pointed out
with considerable pride to newcomers. One of
each group used to wear a brass plate round his
neck denoting that he was King Billy or King
Neddy. Now a blackfellow or a gin in the streets
of Brisbane is looked on as a curiosity. During
Xmas week I saw a crowd round a Queen-street
fancy-shop. Presently a gin with a colored Xmas
supplement in her hand came out. She had on a
big mushroom hat, tied tightly under her chin
with yellow ribbons. She also wore a long pink
wrapper sort of garment. This garment was thin,
and as she stood with her back to the sun
one could not help “seeing through her,” as I
heard it neatly put by a lady standing near me.
lor all the hindrance it was to a thorough under-
standing of her dusky charms, the colored lady
might have discarded her pink garment. When
she moved on the crowd followed her, making the
facetious remarks peculiar to Brisbane crowds.
She took no notice—just sailed majestically along
as though the eccentricities of a Brisbane push
were quite unworthy of her notice. At last a
policeman, with more intellect than the general
run, dispersed the mob. Then the black lady
proceeded to cross the street ignoring nobly ail
cabs, bicycles, carts and trams. She had many
hairbreadth escapes. She stopped between the
tram lines to expostulate with a cab-driver who
had just pulled up in time to avoid knocking her
down. She advised him to “go alonga bush an’
learn drive ’em yarraman.” Suddenly a yell made
her jump six feet clear of the tram lines, and a
tram, with a purple-faced motorman putting the
brakes hard down, occupied the space she had just
vacated. Then she did open out: “Whaffor you
no look out longa me ? Baal you look out. You
bin try knock me down. Toopid phfeller you, my
word ! Whaffor you no look out longa me ? Close
up you bin killem me. I bin tell ’im boss, you
get ’im sack. Toopid pfeller altogedder. My
word ! ” Then she proceeded with great dignity
on to the footpath and up Ed ward-street, and the
setting sun seemed to reveal more of her charms
than ever as she ascended the hill.
“Drifter”: Never expected to see real
pictures of “way-back” life within 20 miles of
Sydney, where the “ Aboriginalities ” are
printed. On the Old Dog-Trap-road (now
Woodville-road) lately saw two middle-aged,
dilapidated, broken-down women in charge
of dray-loads of wood, walloping a brace
of sad, lean mokes towards Granville.
Also noticed an old woman, wrinkled
and bent almost double, usmg a hoe
with surprising force and skill in an
orchard. Gives impression that the
sorrowful “Land of the West” we
read about, where struggling women
dig and toil like men, is creeping
within sound of the roaring city,

People in a city like Melbourne
have little idea of the difficulties
connected with a bazaar out back.
A lady, booked for the flower-stall at
a church fair on a goldfield, worked
for a year beforehand growing the
plants, and scraping and saving every
precious drop of water for her parched
nurselings. Flower-pots being too ex-
pensive owing to the cost of carriage, she
haunted rubbish-heaps for months col-
lecting suitable tins. Long before the
date of the fair, annuals and such were
all a-blowing, so they were sold or raffled
as they were ready, and the money banked.

“ Ed.” : Re “ Prooshan ” on ants’ inability
to bite if the breath be held (B. 25/2/’O4). I have
a time fox that invariably snatches a quick breath
if a gun be pointed at him. I have often fired at
rabbits and hares, and could never understand
them not falling, but “Prooshan” has solved it ;
they hold their breath when they hear a shot,
rendering themselves unpuncturable. The same
thing is noticeable with bike tyres—so long as they
hold their breath there is no need to fear a punc-
ture. When travelling in a train recently a
passenger darted in from a wayside station and
disturbed my solitude. “ Gawd ! ” he said, “I
nearly missed it! ” He told me he had walked 12
miles for the train, and got to the station two
hours early. He had a few beers, and then sat
down under a tree to wait for the train. Went to
sleep, and the whistle of the engine woke him.
Then he said, “ What’s that ? ” and leaped up in
the carriage. “ I’ve got ants on me !” he cried.
I thought of “ Prooshan’s” advice. “ Hold your
breath ! ” He did. He looked like an ant-bed as
they crawled all over him. “No good,” he said,
and then they bit. They were worst at his legs ;
he started picking them off. “ Too damned slow,”
he said, and pulling off his pants, he reached out
the window and shook them outside. The train
just then passed a tree and they caught. He
looked in the carriage, “Gosh!” he said,
“they’re gorne !” We looked out, and against
the sky saw the pants in mid air on the tree. He
had no luggage. When the train pulled up he
d irted into an open station room. He had only got
to the doorstep when shrieks scared him off. He
ran out on to the platform. A paper boy brought
him a Bulletin. He felt down for his sixpence,
but it was in his pants. They locked him up for
obtaining goods under false pretences. After
that he became a raving maniac, and was put in
an asylum, where he tried to hold his breath for
two years. When he recovered he married a
widow with three children. He holds his breath
now every time he sees her coming.
“ WOOL AWAYI"-SUNDA Y AT THE

SHEARER BARBER (busily engaged, to full-bearded

“Ed.”: Along the “inside”
Ninety-Mile Beach (Vic.) are large
mounds consisting of cockle, peri-
winkle and mutton-fish shells, and
occasionally bones mixed with ashes
and charcoal. I have dug them
out, got to the bottom at 4ft., and
now and then found stone axe-
heads, sharpening stones, and once
a seed-grinding stone. I have found
these “blackfellows’ ovens” also in
the Western district (Vic.), along
the Avoca River and on the banks
of creeks in the Goulburn Valley.
In one of these in the Goulburn
Valley I saw many bones unearthed,
together with a human skull. Whe-
ther the corpse had been buried
there, or the bones first picked clean
and flung in, I could only surmise;
the bones and skull mixed with
ashes made me suspicious of canni-
balism. Around Port Phillip bay
these ovens are still to be seen.
Very prominent ones are on the tops
of Red Bluff, St. Kilda; Ricket’s
Point and *Red Bluff, Sandringham.
These coastal ovens are found only
on headlands, where a reef of rocks
runs into the bay, which suggests
that the blacks resorted to these
places for a feed of mussels, peri-
winkles, and other shellfish found
only on the rocks. Judging l ;
the accumulation of shells, these
points must have been resorted
to for many generations. Have
heard of skeletons being unearthed
from these ovens in other parts, but have
myself only found the remains of one. Can any Bul-
letin reader say as to whether these ash-heaps were
used as burying-grounds, on account of the easily-
turned-over soil, or are the bones the remains of
banquets ?

“F.W.C.”: While knocking about this
district (Clifton Q.), I had an adventure with
what the local liars inform me was a genuine
bunyip. Was fishing in King’s Creek one day about
sundown, when I noticed an animal moving on
the water. As it approached I saw it had a head
resembling a calf’s, dark brown in color, and a
large body about sft. in length. It had four legs,
the two front ones like a monkey’s, with-
out the fingers, and the body was covered with a
thick growth of hair. As it got within 30ft. of us
I shied a stick at it. The animal immediately
stopped and assumed a perpendicular, with its
forearms half-raised. My mate threw another
waddy at it, and welted it on the neck. It growled
and moved up the middle of the creek. I then
saluted the animal with a large stone. It suddenly
dived towards us, and came up close to the bank,
making a blood-curdling noise. I started off to
look for my moke. My friend stayed to investi
gate. In about two minutes he also came horse
hunting; he said the beast had started to climb
the bank. The tiling, he said, looked like a seal
(he has never seen a seal), and it snorted like a
grampus. On another occasion a stockman was
riding past a swamp, and he started an animal
that set off at a great pace toward the river, half-
a-mile distant. This animal looked and ran liki
a man, and was about sft. high. Although the
stockman had a good horse, and fled rapidly in a
c mtrary direction, the bunyip reached the river
b fore him, and he never saw it again. Another
pirty was fishing in the Condamine, and
hooked a bunyip. It rose above the water and
growled. Two men failed to pull it out, and it
broke away, and was not seen again. The descrip
tion tallies with the one I saw. I was told of a
bunyip that chased a man and his dog a mile,
caught the dog, and would have got the man also
only he dived into a hollow log. However, 1
think this is only a yarn.

THE OLD TIN TRUNK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is battered, old and broken, and its race is nearly run,
But I cherish and retain it for the service it has done,
And the memories it conjures up of early hopes and fears,
Silent witness of my struggles through a score of weary
years.
It once was bright and handsome and a stylish air it
wore
When we sailed away together from the distant English
shore.
As the old John Elder started there it lay beneath my
bunk—
Ah 1 the outfit that was hidden in that old tin trunk !
It has guarded little treasures that no money could
replace,
And otherwise its usefulness in many ways I trace ;
It has made a good camp wash tub and a comfortable
seat,
And has kept the ants and ’possums from our sugar,
bread and meat.
It has been in dingy lodgings and in elegant hotels,
And Cobb and Co. have dumped it where the outback
settler dwells ;
It has shared with me eviction when my treasury has
shrunk,
And I fled at night in secret with that old tin trunk.
It could tell some stirring stories if it only had a tongue,
For we’ve had our share of hardships since the days when
we were young.
Each dent upon its surface is a sort of outward sign
Of the knocks we have encountered nearly all along the
line.
But the clouds are slowly lifting, and the road is not so
hard,
And I’ll keep a cosy corner for my travel-weary pard.
Though apparently quite empty, and a useless metal
hunk,
It is full of reminiscences, that old tin trunk.

“ Yacka ” writes :
On the Westralian goldfields some years ago I was
lying in my bunk drowsing when 3ft. 6in. of black and
white iguana came stealthily into the tent. I watched
him snap up a couple of dozen flies in as many seconds,
keeping an eye on me all the while. When I got up he
left, but circled closely around the outside of the tent,
and in a manner held out the olive-branch of amity. We
placed a saucer of sugar and water some yards away, and
he scoffed the lot. After that every day he came out of
the hush and took possession of the tent in our absence.
Although he became fairly tame he always kept at arm’s
length, which was unnecessary, as we didn’t want to
touch him. He was as good as a watchdog ; he could
hear approaching footsteps at a distance of 300 yards,
and would sit up in a listening attitude like a dog, and
when 3Mt. of iguana sits up he is a circumstance.
The greatest sporting event in this neighborhood
was when another iguana came and applied
for our fellow’s billet. The new iguana had his
testimonials with him to the effect that he was a sober,
early-rising animal, and had been two years in his last
place. They fought like a couple of dogs, standing up
and grappling each other and rolling over and over, biting
wherever they could get a hold, their long tails lashing
and writhing with anger. The fight had been in progress
about five minutes, and the betting was even, when our
’ana got a good grip of the stranger’s neck, with his teeth.
The latter rolled over in a vain endeavor to dislodge his
adversary whose hold was a “half nelson.” Then the
applicant made off for the bush with his foe hanging on
like a bull-dog and trailing behind. Our fellow let go
after being dragged about 20ft., and the stranger slipped
away like a streak of buttered lightning. After consider-
ing things our animal, who was considerably damaged,
took to the bush in the opposite direction. He remained
away for three days, and we were thinking of writing his
obituary notice when he lined up again as fresh as paint.
The vanquished reptile never re-appeared ; I fancy he was
a non-unionist. Some months later we broke up camp
and returned to Perth, and parted from our iguana with
a pang of regret. He wept when he saw us going and
banged his head against a tree.

“ Win” writes from the centre of this
great country: —
Re boomerangs. I have seen the two-handed boomerang
in Oentralia, but it is never intended for throwing—only
as a club. Here (Winnecke’s depot) the blacks never
throw a boomerang into the air, but in such a manner
that one end strikes the ground about 15 to 20 yards away
from the thrower’s feet. It then ricochets with incredible
swiftness in a series of whirling bounds. When thrown
by an expert in open country it will travel for upwards of
150 yards before it loses its momentum. The boomerangs
here are not made for circling in the air. I have had
some of the blacks trying to make the boomerang return
on its flight in the air, but even several sticks of ’baccy
could not induce the boom, to come back to the thrower.
When the blacks fight they arm themselves with a shield
and two or three boomerangs, which they throw along
the ground at each other, and are wonderfully straight
shots. They are also experts with shields. I have seen
four blacks attack one, who, although only quite a lad,
kept off the others’ boomerangs with hie shield, while he
vigorously returned the attack. The spear only comes
into use as a last resource, and then the niggers do their
utmost to spear each other from behind. All the boome-
rangs and spears are made from mulga wood. In the
north-west of Westralia the blacks use a kind of boomerang
which they calla “kylee.” This is much thinner and
with a sharper curve than the boomerang of the Cen-
tralian blacks. The kylee, when thrown, will whirl round
for several circles in the air before falling to earth. I have
a number of different kinds of boomerangs, and the local
blacks can tell me from which districts I got them
by the markings on and the different bends in them. The
aboriginals here are a low, treacherous crowd. Filth is
their god, and most of them are affected with what is
known as “ blackfellow’s leprosy.” Never let a blackboy
walk or ride behind you, but always make him go in
front. Also, never get on the leeside of him. He is no
relation to attar of rose, and he never even heard of Araby
the Blest.

“ Eiddal” ; In S.A. the sports hunt the
bustard (wild turkey) for all they are worth—in
fact, there’s no other feathered game worth
speaking of since the dry years. In Victoria a
paternal Government protects the noble bird
under its game laws all the year round. “ Getting
at” a wild turkey on the plains is a fine art, and
it generally requires two or three horsemen to en-
compass the fowl’s doom. One man dismounts
and takes cover behind some scrub, while his
mates set off on horseback at a walk to “work”
the victim towards the hiding-place. Zig-zag they
go, perhaps all day long, for as soon as the horse-
man seeks to head the turkey the bird turns and
stalks just the opposite way. Backwards and for-
wards, to the right and to the left they amble,
while the sport in ambush has to have the patience
of Job, with often no turkey for dinner after all.
Aboriginaliars in want of a stronger perfume than
flving-fox are invited to stand to leeward of a
wild turkey’s innards freshly removed.
AN ABORIGINALITY.
MISS ’POSSUM : “ Why is that terrible bounder
Mr. ’Roo—so stuck-up and proud ? ”
MR. ’POSSUM: “ Oh, he claims descent from the
plague rat.”
A bit of old Yandemonia, recited by
lecturer Beattie during the centenary celebrations,
February, 1904 :
Elizabeth Murphy--per Sophia—before Rev. R. Kuop-
wood and Lieutenant W. Sladen, tried for writing or
causing to be wrote a letter directed to Francis Drury,
containing the most infamous language, and accusing
him of a most heinous crime, sentence confirmed by the
Lieutenant-Governor, Colonel Collins : To be tied by her
hands to the cart drawn by the gaol gang, stripped, and
receive 25 lashes, and sent to the settlement at Risdon.
It is to be noticed that, as was usual in those old
times, there was a reverend on the bench. A
large proportion of the floggings of Elizabeth in
the early days seems to have been ordered by
reverends.
HOW ONE WOMAN UNDERSTANDS ANOTHER.
HE: “If she’s so very nervous about ants why does she attend picnics ?”
SHE : “ That isn’t nervousness.”
HE : “ What is it then ?” SHE : “Silk stockings ? ”
“Teddy the Trapper” : It is the hard-
earned money of trustful souls in the bush that
pays to a great extent for the big romantic pill
ads. that form the backbone of the press in Aus-
tralia. The bushie seldom troubles about the
effect (if any) of the new patent medicines he
samples ; all he requires is the uncorroborated
statement of somebody that the stuff is good for
something. Then he sends along his cash and
gives the pills or potion a fair and impartial trial.
The first time I noticed this was at Arajoel station
in the Wagga district. Before any of us had left
our bunks one morning, one of the outside hands,
a strong, health y-looking fellow, came into the hut
with a paper in his hand, and shaking up a
sleeper, said: “Dan, are you goin’ in t’Wagga
to-morrer?” “Yes,” said Dan, “why? You
haven’t finished that last lot of whisky already,
have you?” “No,” was the eager reply; “but
there’s a new blood-purifier advertised here, an’
accordin’ t’ th’ testimonials it’ll just about
cure enythink you name. I want you to
bring me half-a-dozen bottles.” No mor-
phia-maniac could wait with more eager im-
patience for his drug than Jimmy waited
for the new “purifier.” The moment he got the
bulky parcel he tore it open, held up a bottle to
the light, and after gazing at it much as a con-
noisseur would at a bottle of old port, he poured
out a cup full and drank it off. “ Bites all th’
way down,” he said cheerfully ; “it’ll make a new
man o’ me, as that cove says that’s got his futto-
graph over it in the paper.” I have seen a bush-
man mix two liquid medicines together and
swallow the dose on top of half-a-dozen pills.
Pills are occasionally used as counters by bush
card players, and it is a common thing on some
runs to see them staked either loosely or in full
boxes in a game of euchre or poker. I once saw
a trapper win ten boxes of assorted pills and two
bottles of pain-killer, and it is safe to say he swal-
lowed the lot.

“ C.C.” on bush quacks :
If Dowie had made a tour of the backblocks he would
probably have done good business in recruiting for Zion,
for the average bush-dweller is a whale on anything new
in the healing line. The other day, One of the travelling
physicians, who “ cure when all other doctors have failed,”
bore down upon a settler’s house near Bungonia. The
settler’s wife had never seen him before, and he declined
to give his name, which was a foreign one. In a casual
sort of way, she allowed him to make an examination of
herself and daughter. After he had finished, he shook
his head gravely and answered that the mother was suffer-
ing from dyspepsia, which is a pretty safe diagnosis of any
case in the bush. The daughter’s case, he said, was
worse—it was something terrible. Her “tired feeling”
was caused by a string from her heart to her lungs, and
he pledged his medical reputation that she would be dead
in six months—if he didn’t save her. However, he was
willing to cure them both —the mother for 30s. and the
daughter for 10s., though how a girl with her heart and
lungs lashed together by a piece of twine could be saved
from a horrible death for 20s. less than the cost of curing
a simple case of too much salt-horse and damper was not
explained. The woman handed over the 30s. in the good
old casual way without getting any receipt for the cash,
and her suddenly adopted medical adviser departed with
a promise that the miraculous medicine would arrive in
three days to worry the “ string ” and the ill-digested
damper. A week or so later he called again, and demanded
another 10s., and when the woman complained that the
medicine had not arrived, and that the damper still lay
heavy on her chest, and she feared that the “ string ” was
getting worse, he strolled off remarking that he couldn’t
understand why the medicine didn’t come when he
whistled for it. The case ended in court with a fine of
£lO and costs ; alternative, four months. The thrifty
foreigner took the four months. And there are people
who would use the Immigration Restriction Act to keep
desirable scientific men like this out of the country 1 It
is dreadful to think of.
“Boro-Belle”: Be “F.W.C.’s” state-
ment as to the butcher-bird’s method of killing
(8., 11/2/’O4). The laughing-jackass kills its food
m much the same way. While gardening one
morning beneath an old gum tree I heard a blood-
curdling squeak up above, and immediately after
two hollow thuds, followed by an hysterical laugh.
On looking up I saw a jackass perched on a splin-
tery branch holding a frog by the leg in his bill.
Every few minutes the jackass threw his head up
and down, thus giving the frog a couple of whacks
against the branch, after which his mate would
laugh a fiendish laugh. On another occasion I
noticed a jackass with a small bandicoot in his bill
perched on a fence near a prickly-pear bush. He
seemed very busy leaning over the prickly bush,
and when I came suddenly round tne corner he
flew off, leaving the bandicoot impaled on a large
thorn. The bandicoot was already speared m
about four places and quite dead.
THE BROLGA GIRL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Miles and miles the river wanders,
Deep still pools and dancing rills,
Spread o’er the plains
By recent rains
Till it reaches Brolga hills.
Miles and miles of sandy desert,
Salt-bush flats burnt blue and brown,
Wattle trees
On grassy leas
Overlooking Brolga town.
Under skies of dazzling clearness,
Evening skies of rose and pearl,
Morning bright
Or sultry night,
Dreaming of a Brolga girl.
Riding close behind the cattle,
Where the noisy currents swirl,
Urging ever
Thro’ the river
Home to one dear Brolga girl.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be taken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MS. No liability is under-
taken in any case re contributions voluntarily sub-
mitted, whether sent by post or handed in ; and in
no case will MS. be returned unless stamps (of any
State) accompany.
G. Elwyn : “0. and Two Doctors” is rather
steep, and we have already a tale on hand with an almost
identical dissecting room incident... ,-P.B. : Suggestion
too late.... “Jackaroo ” : “Eavesdroppers ” very old jest.
F.F.F. : Verse very stiff : other item rather labored
in humor Phyllis: Rather pretty, but lacks vital
interest S.T.C. : Lively theme flattened out by ponder-
ous treatment Bandar: As far as we can understand
your protest, if you edited the paper you would have put
the pronoun “ I ” 29 times in that short paragraph in
addition to the “ I’s ” that are in it already. Begin to
have a dark suspicion that if you edited the paper it
would cease to be a saleable organ... .R.J.E.O. :If the
other verses were really yours written 18 years ago your
Muse has degenerated in the interval... .J.A. Mac. : Love-
letter not unusually remarkable Junction : You would
rank high in a bad verse competition.. ..W.H. : “Days
Long Ago” is very joggety-jog sort of verse.... Chon :
Vague and battered verse about the “ tyrant’s thrall.” We
like particulars about the “thrall.”.. . ..S.J.C. : The
Bulletin said the same thing on 31st March, and in
various other issues... .Malthus : The play upon the names
of dramas has been done too often. We pay for tales, if print-
able..M.M. : Inland Australia was hospitable once. Nowit
is broke.. .Tony : You’ve tangled it into unintelligibility...
Protectionist: Many thanks for letter. Will write up
some of the points contained in it J. Guthrie : You’ve
got it wrong. The Protectionist principle aims at making
the country rich ; the Democratic principle at preventing
the wealth being monopolised by the few. The U.S. has
Protection, very little Democratic principle, and many
millionaires. France has Protection and a strong Demo-
cratic principle. Consequently it has no millionaires as
England has —but the French workman or peasant, when
he dies, leaves behind him, on the average, about Jive
times as much as the Englishman of the same class....
Ury: No life or vigor in the telling H.E.D.S. : Not
badly written, but arrangement stiff and style too wordy,
F.H.R. : “How he Apologised” and “When Things
Went Well” both rather dull J3.C.5.: “Neath Aus-
tralia’s Sky” has some promise, but metre is irregular,
and subject is one that has already been versed to death.
T.G.D.: “ Lay of Lyne ” weighs more than Bill himself.,..
Herr Bloak : Only a weak pun M.M.C.H.: Not quality
enough —Romley: Good “situation,” but treatment
very slack and inadequate Bombagamie: Funny, but
awkward and sloppy Louis R. : Tamely told J.A.:
Obviously from life, but otherwise uninteresting... Chubb :
Not quite up to standard, but very good for your age.
You should in time do capital work Gideon J. : Verse
rather weak. Prose sketch better W.W.: “ Top-notch
verse ” you consider it. It certainly isn’t—though it’s not
in the lowest notch either Max: You’ve a poor notion
of rhyme, and none at all of metre W.H.T.: Nothing
incredible in the statement, if you consider that a yard of
water weighs scwt., and then multiply this weight by the
velocity.. ..H.W.K.: Sorry still not up the mark....
P.C. : It seems worth while printing a sample, any-
how :
A scheme of economical reform so drastic
Based on that best of all foundations common sense
Will not exempt from its provisions the foreign ecclesiastic
Will not hold sacred peter’s pence
An economical scheme so equitable and fair
The humane heart prompting the enlightened brain
Will ensure no matter how Csesar or the Usurper may fare
That the toiler mental or manual will toil in vain.
P.S
What a hollow mockery the cry Australia for Australians
If they tolerate in any form or pretext the intermeddling
of aliens.
.... Half-past: You are confusing Byron with Byrom
the satirist H.W. (M.L.) : Has one decent stanza ; the
others range from awkward to horrible... .Diorite : Medi-
ocre only. The mining yarn, like the racing yarn, requires
exceptionally vivid treatment Gadfly: Juvenile work.
Merlin : Hopelessly out of our line F.W.: We couldn’t
give any such undertaking Zamiel: Mere purposeless
piffle B. Mac. : You’ve labelled it “ original.” The
spelling and syntax certainly are Cosmos : Your cheer-
ful assurance that the adoption of Henry George’s land-
tax theories (which you seem to have just discovered)
will settle everything—will even stop the attempted influx
of Chinese and Japs to Australia —is very young and
fresh. So is your proposal that we should explain George’s
idea to the Japs, and then they will settle down peace-
fully in their own country and not trouble us. Japan
tried George’s theories before there was any George;
land-tax, in the old and very hungry days, was practically
the sole source of Jap. revenue. The Japs could give
you a lot of information about Henry Georgeism....
G. Munro : That well-meaning old gentleman’s maun-
derings on behalf of a Brown Australia hardly need
replying to. Still, will be glad to hear from you if you
have anything interesting to say C.C.H. : Will try
to give “ Bill ” a lift... .D.W.D. : Considering the admis-
sions made by the butter brigands themselves, can’t see
where the unfairness came in C.K. : “Two Songs”
rather a weak addition to the avalanche of small love
verses Ed. : Some good items. We don’t undertake to
acknowledge pars. This column would burst if we did.
Several of your previous contributions were already in
type Sive : “ Butterflies ” rather mechanical verse....
Dux : Sorry they fail Alcohol: There is no secret cure
for drunkenness ; the one way is to give up the alcohol,
and where the patient’s mind is too weak for a voluntary
cure, the only reliable remedy is segregation The
Weaner : You go over old tracks; no g00d.... J.A.S. :
You state the obvious and commonplace with a pomposity
of phrase worthy of B. Smith Eyetalian : The lawyer,
as a bye-product of our complicated social processes,
seems just at present to be a necessary evil W.E.H.:
Will do so privately Courabyra : Bulletin absolutely
refuses publication of your instructions for the murder of
satin birds.., .H.E.G. : It’s a neat little log in verse, your
nautical poem, and has been put in the wood-yard with
the other logs F.R.C.T. : Thanks, but we’ve no time
to translate German remarks to fit Thos. Bent; the
resources of the English language are not yet quite ex-
hausted Tom Hack : Yes, Millicent was a nice girl, but
you don’t dish her up quite well enough. Pars, all too
much drawn out, though fair in form and matter....
Star : Some skill certainly ; not up to publication mark.
Max Murphy: One verse anyhow deserves the glare
of publicity:—
Why should there be such bitter strife
Among sky pilots ?
’Twere better they should lead the life
Of modest violets.
A DREADFUL ACCIDENT.
“ Oh, Lor’ I And he’s got all the cigarettes in
his pocket.”
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
J.H.F.: Drawing rough and joke small G. 8.: Is
your sketch meant to imply that the old age pensioner’s
address would naturally be in front of a pot of beer at a
bar ? Do you think Bent’s pension leaves much for beer ?
Henry Clay : Poor drawing ; poor beer joke
N. H. Skinner : Dull joke, and heaven only knows what
the apparition in the background is meant for Emac :
No human being ever looked like that... .M.E.H. : Horse
joke very obscure P.S.P. : Words fail to say how poor
it i 5.... A.W.Well, it nearly got there J.H.C.: You
can’t draw —except perhaps a wheelbarrow or an inference.
K.C.N. : There are things better left unsaid Un-
suitable : Hardy, H.H.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“W.E.” : Never trust a religious contractor?
Have known a few, and as holy frauds Dowie wasn’t a
patch on them. One had a contract for splitting fencing-
posts at per hundred. Had them nicely stacked for
counting ; and they were counted and passed, but when
the posts came to be handled later on all the bottoms
of the heaps consisted of post-ends about lti inches long
carefully placed to look like the genuine article. Another
had a contract for pine boards. Cut the timber on
, Government reserves during the week days and expounded
the “Word” to the men on Sundays. ' They were often
caught, and he bought the confiscated pine cheap ! Only
heard of one man being paid in cash, and he waited on
the holy man in his office with the meat-axe.
‘‘A.P.R.’” : The imaginative man is often dan-
gerous. Ten years ago a foolish exporter blended a
quantity of eucalyptus extract with a cargo of honey,
thinking the mixture would boom for medicinal purposes.
John Bull immediately concluded that the odious flavor
was natural to all Australian honey, and has, since then,
paid half-value for the best local bee-juice. Apparently
it is part of Bull’s economical system to conceive a violent
prejudice against our products, such as meat, and there-
after to buy them cheap.

A Melbourne suburban photographer has this

“Alevnous”: Robbery and fraud seem to rule
the roost in this land of the “boundless resources.” A
lady friend entered a nail-driving competition for a prize
“ valued at a guinea,” and paid a shilling entrance fee.
After hitting her thumb 613 times and the nail about
half-a-dozen, she succeeded in winning the prize, and
smilingly sailed up to the platform to receive it. She was
then presented with a box of someb idy’s pills with the
advertisement “worth a guinea a box” attached. As
sle is in a thoroughly healthy condition she doesn’t want
tie pills. They are not worth to her a penny a box. If
she takes legal proceedings she will lose a d >zen guineas ;
and if she does nothing she countenances the fraud. Un-
necessary to remark that the affair was connected with a
church.

Recent reports knocked most of the heart out
o; the men who have taken up the mohair (Angora goat)
industry in the inside of Australia—the market, it was
said, was well supplied at a shade over a shilling per lb.
But now there are trade reports of large sales of lustre
dress-goods in America, the mohair market is looking up,
and the goat isn’t the despised beast he threatened to be.
AH the same, it has been made fairly clear that growing
mohaar is a precarious business, like every other business
that depends on the fashions in women’s dress.

An Adelaide bailiff proposes forming a City
Property Owners’ Protection Society, with himself as sole
director. The endeavor of the society would be to keep
undesirable tenants out of dwellings. The bailiff has had
a, very large experience of undesirable tenants, and his
business would be to inspect persons who wanted houses,
and report, for a small fee, as to whether they were
known as individuals from whom rent was collected with
difficulty. Some such method is in vogue in parts of
London, and in a small community the method should
work all right—unless undesirables begin to tip the
society to report favorably upon them.

Beth ” : A man I know has a selection on the
. fth Coast containing a gold mine, which for years has
yielded about Boz. to the ton —-besides another ounce in
the tailings, which isn’t bothered with. He works hard
at the selection, and, while he can make ends meet, leaves
the mine alone. But if he gets behind, the battery is
started, a couple of hundred pounds’ worth of gold
knocked out in no time, and then the mine is shut down
again. Asked him why he didn’t work the place regu-
larly, and he looked at me in disgust. “The money’s
there ; safer than yer banks ; an’ I can get plenty when-
ever I want it.” Told him he could get thousands for the
place to-morrow, but he wasn’t interested. “Could ’a
got it yesterday,” he said, “ but thousands is no use ter
me.”

Salvarmy Booth’s latest cadge asks that the
false teeth of the dead should be donated to the Army !
One of the funniest things in the world is to
hear one bookmaker proposing the health of another
bookmaker and paying tribute to his unswerving in-
tegrity and unquestionable uprightness. And the next
funniest thing is to hear the toasted Isaac reply with some
well-chosen remarks touching the untarnished honor of
his brother Moses.

A quaint item cropped up in a Towers (Q.)
vagrancy case. The police discovered on the person of a
certain vagrant a dummy note. It was explained that
aforesaid dummy was not intended for circulation, but to
be flourished as a sign of solvency in a “ two-up ” school,
n the nourisher won—well and good. If he lost—the
sooner he lit out for foreign parts the better.

uact with the Br.tish Government, reserves the right to

A correspondent to the Australian Manufac-
turing Jewellers’ Gazette writes, cautioning the public
against “ rheumatic ” rings, and cites the case of a young
man who recently came into his shop with his finger
very much inflamed and swollen through wearing a ring
of this description. It was found that the ring was of
such hard steel that neither file nor saw would touch it,
and the jeweller experienced very great difficulty in
breaking it. Had it been too stout to break, it would
probably have meant the loss of the. finger. He recom-
mends that people wearing rheumatic rings should see
that they are of soft steel.

South Australia has now to get at least £250,000
or £300,000 a year more for its wheat and hay crops than
it did 10 years ago in order to make the same profit. In
1890 artificial fertilisers were practically unknown there ;
in 1895 the imports only amounted to £670 ; last season
anything from 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 acres were fertilised,
requiring about 45,000 tons, valued at about £200,000.
The purchase of drills and the extra labor involved absorbs
another £lOO,OOO, or close up. A little more than half
the total fertiliser used is now manufactured within the
State, and the proportion is growing steadily.

A smug piece of evidence was given before the
Victorian Butter Commission by a very smug Scotch
person named J. P. McMeekin. McMeekin was one of
the butter agents who admitted that he had received a
secret commission from the shipping companies. And
yet a hunk from his evidence read as follows: —“ One
factory manager asked us for commission on business we
did with him ; and another, a young man, made a similar
request. I wrote to the latter a private letter, pointing
out the impropriety of his proposal, and he thanked me
for my advice 11”

Recent death of “old Tom Smith,” who, in the
seventies, was head of the Bendigo stockbroking firm of
Smith and Robertson, recalls the time when “ The Bee-
hive ”of Bendigo hummed. In ’7l-2 the firm’s turn-over
in scrip ran into £2,090,000 a year. At that time there
were 2000 registered mining co.’s and syndicates in
Bendigo, and 300 more at Eaglehawk. Not long before
his death, Smith described to an unbelieving group of
jobbers how he once floated a co. of 24,000 shares in two
minutes. “ And now,” the old man concluded mourn-
fully, “ it would take me two years to work off anything
in the company line.”

The Victorian Miners’ Association is getting
into rough water. Some of the members who have
travelled a bit want to lead it into politics ; and the old
hands, who are in most of the offices, are kicking, and a
split is threatened. The old hands’ idea of a union is a
society that pays sick and funeral benefits and occasion-
ally ventures to ask the mine-owner if he would be so
kind as to send its members down a little more fresh air.
And when he isn’t so kind—well, there’s the funeral
benefit, anyhow. They are well-meaning veterans, most
of them, but they don’t understand the new boss whose
god is called Dividends.

Premier Jimmy, of Westralia, making an
election speech, said he “ expected a great change in the
London money market in 18 months, and hoped they
would then be able to borrow plenty of money for public
works.” This spectacle of Mr. Jimmy looking forward to
the time when they will be able to build the local drain
and a few miles more railway out of loans is pathetic. It
shows that, as soon as Cohen gives the sign, at least one
State will rush him just as vigorously as ever. And that
State is the very one which ought to be most ashamed of
borrowing, because it is the State which is using up its
capital the fastest. Instead of making' the wealth of the
country pay for the development of the country, it is allow-
ing the State to be gutted of its g-old and its timber, and
the development is hung up until money can be borrowed
to do it with. The people who have taken the cream will
thus escape payment, and the bill will be handed on to
those who are left with the skimmed milk. Jimmy, who
says that his State is the richest in the Commonwealth,
and boasts of its vast output, brands it nevertheless as a
poor country that can’t make its local drain without bor-
rowing the money to do it with. It is about up to
Westralia to hint to its Jimmy Government that it
expects it to live up to its boasts.

The case of the Hordern frauds has moved on a
little further. It“ is over a year since Anthony
Hordern, of Sydney, secured the conviction of two em-
ployees for pilfering. The alleged steal was under £lO
in each case, and on these charges accused received long
terms of imprisonment. Ever since Horderns have been
trying to recover from the estates of the prisoners some
of their stolen goods, which they estimate at thousands.
The estates were thrown into bankruptcy. Horderns then
sought to prove a claim in each estate, each claim being,
not the firm’s actual losses, which could not be proved,
but the balances lying to the credits of bankrupts when
they were arrested. These respectively were £lOO5 and
£750. The Registrar in Bankruptcy held that, as the
bankrupts’ only excuse for the possession of these sums
was successful gambling, and as no fortune could be
honestly amassed on the pittance of a salesman, the pre-
sumption is that the £1755 belongs to the Hordern firm,
and has ordered accordingly. Next step will probably be
an appeal to the Full Court, especially as good old Costs
will come out of the estates if the bankrupts lose, and
they can’t lose more than the whole lot in any case.

Shareholders in the Transpacific (Brazil) Mining
Co., principally Charters Towers men, are endeavoring to
digest a long report, by one Fred Brown, on their ven-
ture. After spending some thousands in equipping their
dredge, etc., shareholders were given a run for their
money. A few ounces of gold were promptly recovered,
the dredge capsized, and two men were drowned. Ad-
vised now to put up another £4OOO for a fresh start. Also,
they are advised that if they put that £4OOO into proper-
ties nearer home, and sit on a log just handy and watch
it, they’ll probably get quicker returns.

Dean Pigou, in his lately-issued “Recollections,”
gives the authority of Dr. Pettigrew, one of the most
fashionable London surgeons, for the existence of a high-
toned burglar who must have been the original of the
Spider in “Silver King.” This man, in trying to get
away with the silver plate from one of the stately homes
of England, was fired on by the butler, and received a
charge of small shot in the back. Pettigrew was sum-
moned to extract the shot at the burglar’s residence. He
had to enter at a secret door. Then a hole was opened
through the ceiling. Pettigrew was hauled up by a rope
round his waist, and found the burglar in his study. After
extracting the shot the surgeon was lowered again through
the hole, and found a recherche supper awaiting him.

San Francisco Examiner alleges that six people
of that city have discovered that they are heirs to property
in Australia, valued at £5,000,000, and two of them are
coming out to secure it. The Frisco editor adds that
“ the property is situated in Mudgee, a populous suburb
of Melbourne.” This is inverting things with a vengeance.
Hitherto it has been the Australian who found he was
heir to millions in Timbuctoo, near London. Now we are
going to be rushed in our own country by wild Americans
who want to take our Mudgee away in a carpet bag.

Deakin as a Federalist.
From the Federal Gallery comes this view of
Deakin as a Federalist:—
There are many kinds of men to be afraid of, but the
most‘dangerous is the polite man who knows what he
wants, and sets out to get it in his own way. That is the
kind of man Deakin has been in Federal politics.
In 1894, when he cro sed over from the Patterson
Ministry to the side of the House where Shiels led a
remnant of a great party, Deakin broke up the Patterson
Ministry by that very act. The remnant had
no prospective Premier, certainly no prospective
Treasurer, amongst them. Deakin proposed that
George Turner should lead. .Shiels agreed. When
the Patterson crowd were swept away George Turner
was sent for. “Where will I And a Treasurer?” asked
Turner. “Be a Treasurer yourself,” said Deakin, and in
a gingerly sort of way Turner set out to be a Treasurer.
“What are you going to do?” asked Turner. “Sit
behind you,” said Deakin ; and he did. Sat behind
Turner for five years, voting as solidly as the merest
hack. Shiels said he would do the same, but the Raven
was intriguing before the first session was half-way
through. Step by step Turner was pushed on the
Federal way, and when he was at Hobart, negotiating
with Reid for the Federal Convention, Deakin was there
attending the last meeting of the Federal Council,
watching and guiding all the time. Then the Convention
came, and, Turner dropping into the background for a
time, Barton took the lead, and Deakin was behind
Barton as he had been behind Turner.
Australia will always marvel how Barton came to chase
the Federal ideal through the N.S.W. electorates with
vigor and courage. The goad was behind him all the
time, and Deakin, who never appeared in N.S.W., kept
Barton at his top, and in time the game was won. In
Victoria there was a time when the chances of the Bill
looked ugly. The Labor party said it was not democratic
enough. The As® objected because it saw power slipping
away. Turner and Isaacs wavered, but plucked up
courage when Deakin threw down a challenge at Bendigo.
Victoria went solid after that, but it was touch and go
that there was as bad a split as in N.S.W. After Bendigo,
Deakin could not get back out of the open, and Turner
missed a great chance of keeping the lead that had been
forced upon him.
Chamberlain sent word that he wanted to alter the
Bill, and it was being fixed up that Barton should go as
the delegate from Australia to meet him. To Barton’s
dismay he found Deakin and Kingston going with him.
Such times as they had in London ! Isaacs, who was there
at the time over the tramway case, says : “ Australians
have no idea of the stirring times the delegates went
through.” Chamberlain fought hard to keep the new
Commonwealth in chains. He did strike out the strong
words in the preamble making the Act bind the
Crown. “ But for this,” says Isaacs, “there would not
be a shadow of a doubt as to the Arbitration Bill being
constitutional.” Chamberlain wanted the Privy Council
to be supreme, too, in law. When Kingston and Deakin
failed with Chamberlain, they drove home their argu-
ments at the big Conservative banquets held in their
honor at night. “ You should have heard those speeches,”
says Isaacs." Deakin says but little about them, but he
does tell a story of * one deadly dull banquet. “ I
tried them with a story,” he said, “ and they
caught on, but Kingston, who followed, was
reckless. He poured out story upon story upon the blue-
blooded aristocrats, and broke them all to pieces. They
yelled with laughter, and cheered with enthusiasm. ‘ I
wish we had you fellows here,’ said the Conservative
Agent afterwards, ‘ you see what sticks we have to win
with 1 It was the day after that that the delegation
threatened to appeal to Her Majesty’s people against the
refusal of Her Majesty’s Government to grant full powers
to the High Court, and Her Majesty’s Chamberlain gave
way. He didn’t want those men on the platforms. It was
after that that the “ honors ” came along, and Deakin said
“No thank you ” to everything—K.C.M.G. and P.C. and
D.C.L. and all the rubbish. “If you want to make a good
deal when you go to London take nothing for yourself,”
says Deakin. “It worries them, and they get so troubled
finding out what the unusual game is that it is much
easier to make the deal.”
They all came back, and, in an evil hour, Hopetoun
listened to Potts Point, and sent for Lyne because every-
one knew that Reid could bump Lyne, but the Ministry
had been fixed up two months before, and Lyne
could get no one to join. “What is Deakin doing?”
was all the reply Lyne got. Deakin was shooting
rabbits at Point Lonsdale at the time. “ I don’t think
the chain will hold,” he said, when the news came
through from Barton —just a short wire, “It is Lyne.”
But it did hold. One last intrigue before the end was to
keep Kingston out and put Holder in, but Deakin said
they might just as well not start at all as start without
Kingston. He was quite right. The only time when the
game ran queer was when he failed to persuade Kingston
to stay in the Cabinet. “ All right,” he said in the last
interview, “ I suppose we will go down. Good luck.”
Kingston had mighty bad luck. Hence the trouble to-
day. What might not have happened with a bold, daring
Kingston with his tack to the wall these days ! He
would not have been silent throughout three critical
weeks.

How to Treat Cuts and Bums.
When the outer skin has been broken or removed
by a fall, a blow, or some other form of violent
friction, giving rise to pain, discoloration, or in-
flamed swelling, the first step is to wash away
every particle of dirt from the injury. Arrest
bleeding by pressure round about, and then apply
Zam-Buk direct with the hand, or with the aid of
a piece of clean lint.
For burns, anoint gently with Zam-Buk, and
cover up at once with clean linen rags or cotton
wool, so as to exclude all the air. A fresh applica-
tion of Zam-Buk upon a piece of lint subsequently
will hasten the healing of the sore.
Cut wounds, lacerated wounds, punctured
wounds, poisoned wounds, and gun-shot wounds,
may be treated by Zam-Buk with equal effect.
Zam-Buk combines the advantages of a soother, a
healer, and an antiseptic; and being free from
rancid animal fats and mineral poison, can be
used with perfect confidence and safety. It is also
most easily absorbed by the skin.
You may send a penny stamp to the Zam-Buk
Sampling Office, Pitt-street, Sydney, for a sample
box ; or obtain a full size-size one for Is. 6d., or
3s. 6d. (family size, containing nearly four times
the quantity), of all chemists, or direct from the
Zam-Buk Co., Pitt-street, Sydney. Zam-Buk is
approved by athletes and all classes of workpeople
as a valuable “first aid” in everyday accidents.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
As a party we are opposed to borrow-
ing. ■ From the first Ministerial speech of Prime
Minister Watson.
The rush for the civil service seats in Vic.
State Parliament is simply chaotic. At time of
writing there are 33 candidates for the Assembly
seats and four candidates for the one Upper House
seat.
The Argus reported Labor man Solly’s
slogging of Bent even to this : —“ Recognising the
jobs Bent had put up, to place him on the Treasury
benches was like putting a burglar in a bank and
asking him to be honest.”
The ideal coalition would have Bill Lyne
as Premier and George Reid as Postmaster-
General, with Bill telling George frankly every
now and then about the vastness of his incapacity
to even lick a stamp correctly.
Says Melbourne Age (16/5/’O4)
,^, ia » foregone conclusion that the Bent Government
will be returned at the next General Election by an over-
whelming majority.
It is a fine large prophecy. But wasn’t there once
a man named Trenwith ?
Considering how Bent’s crowd in Victoria
protests against “class legislation,” it is inter-
esting to note that every deputation of the
farming class (which specially supports Bent) that
has waited on the Globular One has come to ask
for money, aid, concessions or legislation on
behalf of the farming class exclusively. Its life is
one long howl for class legislation.
The British politician seems as fond of
alliteration and rhymes and catch phrases as John
Norton hunself. Disraeli once upset a Liberal
Ministry with his denunciation of “plundering
and blundering.” Now a Liberal heaves at
Balfour s Tory Ministry an accusation of “sham,
shuffle and shunt,” which sounds, with its suc-
cession of hisses, like the arrival of three serpent^
The Victorian farmer is still crying out for
Socialism without knowing in the least the name
of the thing he is calling for. The Colac farmers
have over 2000 tons of potatoes and onions stacked
a ® Bo Ba y. an d as the low prices ruling in
Melbourne and elsewhere won’t pay the freight on
the produce they are now asking the Government
*°.. < ?P en U P an export trade, as otherwise the stuff
will have to lie and rot.
, I* is all very well to advise Australia to
. thl . nk Imperially,” but so much that the Empire
is mixed up with has begun
to stink Imperially.
EXPLAINED .
INDIGNANT CITIZEN : “That brute you sold me as
a silent watch-dog barks all night through
FANCIER: “There y ar' guvner, yue gorn an’
left him in the night air, an’ he’s got a touch
o’ whoopin’ corf !”
The British income-tax cormorants have pro-
posed that if an Australian company has a branch
office, however small and unimportant, in England,
it must pay to England income tax on all the profits
earned in Australia. Surely it is time that Aus-
tralia retaliated with an absentee-tax, or did
something to kick back at the outrageous J. Bull ?
Sydney D.T. when the coalition that didn’t
come off was being arranged—
All the points have been considered, and it is stated
that nothing has been embodied that will wound the
susceptibilities of the most radical or the most conserva-
tive.
There showed the master hand of Reid—a perfect
Yes-No coalition.
With the one exception of Kingston, who
reigned for over six years, Premier Jenkins
has held continuous office for a longer period than
any other head of the Government m S. Australia.
.f° the end of his third year on May 15.
Which is a significant commentary on the manner
in which Federation has denuded S.A. politics of
its best men.
A fair example of the N.S. W. “ Reform ”
candidate is John Miller of Bathurst. John says
he is a strong Freetrader who is in favor of en-
couraging local industries. He pro-
poses to reduce railway freights
to a “commercial basis”—they
being already so low that the
railways don’t pay. He
seeks to restrict borrowing
(he doesn’t say how far—
probably he means to
restrict it to £5,000,000
a year) except for such
works as are “ virtually
necessary to the internal
welfare of the State.”
That is to say he de-
clares himself, if his
words mean anything, in
favor of unrestricted
borrowing for necessary
works whether they are
reproductive or not
(road-repairing, for in
stance is a necessary
work) and restricted
borrowing (how restricted
he doesn’t say) for needless
works. Also he proposes (after
reducing the railway revenue and
not making up the loss in any other
way) to extend the old age pension
system and spend a lot of money on water
conservation and resumption of large estates.
Likewise he favors “sound and constitutional
(Government ” without explaining what that is.
Big John Forrest, of Westralia, after
touring round and personally inspecting Federal
capital sites, reported thus :
In my judgment Lyndhurst in no way compares with
Dalgety as a suitable site for the Federal city, and it is
astonishing to me that there should be anv room for two
opinions on the subject.
Peacock, who has only once had to fight
for his seat at Clunes and Allendale (Vic.) in the
last 15 years, and then against a very weak
antagonist, isn’t expected to win by much this
time. Iwo rival candidates and the £5O he got from
the boss of the 1.0. F. Assurance concern make up
52 very strong opponents.
This pertinent idea was advertised and
Pfid for in the Election Notices of the Age,
W 04 > by a woman in Tommy Bent’s electorate,
(ohe attended Marshal Lyle’s meeting, and openly
asked the opponent of the Unspeakable Tommy
whether he would support the idea): —
mHE Declining Birth Rate.—Friends of the young
-»• bacheior support only those CANDIDATES who
pledge themselves to tax heavily the wealthy, elderly
bachelor, the money to be set aside for the purpose of
assisting the young bachelor who is anxious to marry but
is prevented through lack of means.
During the first quarter of 1904N.5.W.
gamed 4982 people (or at the rate of 19,928 per
annum) by excess of births over deaths; and 2098
(or at the rate of 8392 per annum) by excess of
arrivals over departures. This means that the
mnux of population is greater than it has been
sinoe 1891, and also greater than in 1887, 1888,
or 1889; but the usual remarks about the Six
Hatters, and about immigration being suppressed
by democratic legislation, will doubtless appear in
the Sydney papers just the same.
The Victorian railway employees will prob-
ably make the Bent Government wish, very soon
after June 1, that separate representation of the
public service had never been thought of. For
the first time there will be a man in the
Assembly whose sole business it will be
to show up the shifts, dodges, steals, mean-
nesses and rottenness of the railway sys-
tem. The regulations prohibit the men
from “communicating to any person . . .
upon any matter affecting the De-
partment'or business thereof,” and the
result was that no previous member
ever knew the real inwardness of
the service. But now, through the
action of the Bent-Irvine Govern-
ment, the railway men will have
a representative who doesn’t need
to be illegally “communicated”
with—he will know already.
Probably among the first people
to feel sorry and to rush to
Bent for the repeal of ‘ ‘ separate
representation ” will be those
who yelped loudest for it—those
Deformers who have been for
years in the habit of extracting
“concessions,” “rebates,” “al-
lowances,” “special rates,” &c.,
&c., from the railways.
The cheapest policeman in Austra-
lian pay is the Papuan native village con-
stable. He gets 10s. a year and two uni-
forms, and after a while is entrusted with
a pair of handcuffs. When that point is
reached there are no other worlds for him
to conquer.
Under a section of the Federal Judiciary
Act, which provides that any accused person, who
satisfies a Supreme Court Judge that he or she is
without means, may claim counsel’s services at
the public expense, Justice Hodges has intimated
to Attorney-General Higgins that the woman
Olive Douglas, awaiting trial on two charges of
personation at the recent election, should be given
means of defence. This is the first case under
that section of the Act.
“ Every Britisher likes to see the freehold
ahead of him,” said one of Bent’s poodles at a re-
cent Vic. election meeting. Possibly he does, but
in his own country, where he allows two or three
hundred men to own practically all the land, the
freehold is too far ahead to be seen through a
telescope. And in Victoria three-fourths of the
people can’t see the freehold ahead of them till
the big estates are broken up by a much more
sincere agriculturist than Howler Bent. Why
they can’t see it is that the convexity of the earth
blots out objects that are several generations
ahead.
The Labor Party is sending Brandt, a
Melbourne man, up to Hampden, and is thus
doing its best to give the seat to the Bent crowd.
Left alone, Oman can easily beat Trashworth ;
but every Brandt vote is a vote less to Oman, and
the result now is uncertain
SOMETHING USEFUL.
Bent: “If there's going to be a fall Til have
something to fall on!"
Victoria’s humorous “Freetrade and
Liberal Association ” has decided to run a Cobden
Centenary celebration in Melbourne in June next,
and has asked Yes-No Reid and Josiah Symon to
play first fiddles thereat! That is an unkind
way of dragging up Reid’s past. It’s quite a
month since he has been a Freetrader.
Already favorable press opinions of the
new Australian Government are drifting this way
from Bull’s country. Here are two recent cable-
grams :
St. James’s Gazette says that Mr. Watson’s attitude in
regard to military organisation seems to promise that the
Ministry is inclined to accept responsibilities.
The Pall Mall Gazette says the intention of Mr. Wat-
son to maintain military efficiency has a significance which
our anti-armament Radicals should note.
A feature in Vic. country election meet-
ings is the cheer given when the candidate de-
nounces the Age. A paper that, a few months
ago, stated that the Irvine-Bent people were “ not
fit to live, not ready to die, and whose methods of
finance would, if carried on by private firms, land
them inside the gaol,” can’t expect to be taken
seriously when it turns round and supports the
party it so reoently vilified.
Melbourne Argus doesn’t make any bones
over the motive impelling the Tory Coalition
The Coalition may not take plaoe exactly on the lines
which Mr. Deakin marked out, but it is certain to come.
If two separate herds on poor grass are divided by a low
fence from a fat pasture, there will soon be a coalition on
that pasture. That is not transcendentalism, but it is
politics.
Cynieal, but doubtless true. The Tory paper
knows best what greedy and unpatriotic a.nima.la
Tory members are.
Hughes on Reid :
At the elections, as is well known, Mr. Reid and other
members on his side strongly denounced the contract
labor provision, the White Ocean policy, the six hatters
incident, the Petriana myth, and other matters, and he
and they now come down and ask the House to endorse
their right to carry out the administration of this Act.
What an abandonment of principle was this ! What a
oomplete repudiation of hustings pledges ! (Cheers ) I
ask the country now what credence, what faith, is to be
placed upon a man of this kind ?
Bent’s campaign of bellowing at large
seems to have weakened what little brain he ever
possessed; he couldn’t understand why the rail-
way men should select Solly and Hannah as their
candidates. “Why didn’t they put up decent
men, who would meet the Government half way’”
he complained. That’s just what Solly and
Hannah intend doing. As a rule, when the fight
begins the combatants meet half-way—in the
middle of the ring. Then one of them biffs the
other hard.
“Pinch”: The importation of foreign
labor at sweating rates of pay is more pronounced
in Westralia to-day than before the introduction
of the Alien Immigration Act. In a court case
recently, a member of a German street band
sued for his wages. It was admitted in court that
he had been imported under contract to receive
17s. a week wages; but he couldn’t tootle satis-
factorily and was sacked. Three members of the
band run the show and employ five others at that
munificent rate.
Melbourne Age on coalitions :
In its very nature a coalition is always an evil. We
have never had a Coalition Government in Australia but
what its after consequences have been a lengthened
obliteration of party fines, with a consequent stagnation
of political thought and enterprise. Any temporary good
achieved has always been neutralised by a long course
of legislative barrenness. It may be doubted whether
Victoria has even yet recovered from the blighting effects
of the Service-Berry coalition, which led to the Gillies-
Deakin coalition, with all its ruinous railway and other
expenditure, in which millions of money were wasted
with no vigilant Opposition to check it. It is quite true
that a Deakin-Reid coalition is urgently pressed in all
Conservative quarters ; but that is in the hope that it
would sap the life of Liberalism and give to a Conserva-
tive minority an undue weight in the counsels of the
Commonwealth.
The Yes-Reid and No-ditto, from S.M.
Herald report of the Affirmative-Negative's-
recent speech:—
One of my grayest objections to the Labor party is that
while pandemonium may rage in the caucus, and indivi-
dual opinions assert themselves freely and strongly, thi
moment a decision is reached the voice we hear in thii
chamber is the view of the collective conscience and in-
tellect of the party.
Also about his own secret caucus with Deakin:—
There is a stage, however, in every (party) negotiation
that must be private. The public should not know what
principles are talked about, they only want to know what
is agreed upon.
Vic. Premier Bent received a letter from
a State school teacher offering to stand for one of
the separate representation seats as a Ministerial
candidate. The writer of the letter remarked
among other things that “ It would be my duty to
endeavor to check the fires of discontent and
mutiny whereby we are descending to the level of
Russia, and to persuade my fellow servants to
come to reason.” It is to be hoped this amusing
person does stand—just for the satisfaction of
seeing how badly he falls and hearing his skull
bump on the hard, hard road.
Marshal Lyle is doing good service by
fighting Victorian Premier Bent at Brighton. The
Victorian Fatman can only vote once, but he can
vote either where he lives or where his property is
located. Brighton is full of Fat, and if it votes
for Cabbage Thomas at Brighton then it can’t vote
against Labor man Tunnecliffe at Melbourne. On
the other hand, if it swarms into Melbourne to
wipe out Tunnecliffe it may down him, but some-
thing shocking may happen to Bent. Already
Fairbairn, of Toorak, is urging his friends not to
sacrifice him for the sake of the city contest.
The Akgus on the Watson Government’s
proposed tobacco monopoly:—
What are the people to gain by it ? In France the
Government has a monopoly of the tobacco, and in no
civilised country is tobacco dearer for the execrable
quality supplied.
The people are to gain old age pensions by it —but
the Argus apparently didn’t observe that trifle.
It is wonderful the things the Argus can avoid
noticing. It could pass an elephant on its own
staircase without seeing it—if it thought the ele-
phant was one of Watson’s reforms.
“ Ramrod ” writes :
The farcical nature of Legislative Council elections in
Victoria may be fairly gauged by the proceedings at a
meeting recently held at Warragul, one of the principal
centres of Gippsland Province. The audience, chairman
and reporters included, numbered twelve, and to this
“ huge ” assemblage Pearson and Crooke delivered the
usual platitudes of Legislative Councillors. Then the
audience was allowed to ask questions. At first it seemed
as if no one took sufficient interest in things to ask any
questions. Finally an old gentleman who owns muon
local property asked in a quavering voice if either of the
candidates would be good enough to tell him the meaning
of the words “ Dei Gratia" found stamped on coins of
the realm. The two solid Tory candidates didn’t volun-
teer a translation. “Don’t know what you mean,” said
one. “ Can’t understand you,” said the other. There
was a painful pause. The chairman came to the rescue
and expressed the opinion that “ it meant one of the titles
of honor of the King. ” “Ha ! ha ! —wrong again ! ”
shrieked the old property owner. Then, after a painful
pause, and squaring his shoulders, he went on : “I’ll tell
you what it means. It means ‘By the power of the King,’
and why, I want to know, can’t we have the Bible in
State schools Dei Gratia, and chuck the referendum ? ”
Then the meeting closed as feebly as a broken port-
manteau.

THE
PROPOSED
COALITION.
“Mr. George Turner did not make such extensive
efforts to conceal his movements. He had on an old hat
and a flannel shirt, and looked as though he was off fish-
ing.”—Sydney TELEGRAPH .
Quite a number of people have been
busily engaged lately calling Vic. local Pre-
mier Bent a liar. In one of his whirling,
incoherent speeches Bent alleged that A. M.
David, of Ballarat, had retired from the Public
Service through infirmity of body on a substantial
pension. David promptly stated that he never
retired owing to infirmity of body and he never
received a pension, and he called Bent a liar or
something suggestive thereof. Bent simply
tumbled down, and remarked as he tumbled that
“ someone had told him so.” Then Bent stated
that one J. J. Griffin, who retired from the-
Railway Service sometime ago, was going around
whining to get back. Griffin immediately labelled
Bent’s statement as a lie. And Bent again
tumbled down, remarking, as he went, that
“someone had told him so.” Premier Watson
also took a hand in branding Bent a liar. Bent
alleged that the Victorian transferred depart-
ments were costing thousands of pounds more
under Federal administration than they did
under State control. Watson produced indisput-
able figures from the Treasury to show that Bent
did not know what he was talking about. Almost
every specific statement made by Bent during the
election campaign has been proved to be untrue,
and Bent’s standing excuse is that “someone or
other somewhere or other told him so.”

A POLICY foe the COMMONWEALTH,
Price, 6d.; Posted, Bd.
Thus C. E. Davies, M.L.C. (Tasmania),
on the defeat at the polls of nonagenarian Adye
Douglas :
It is poor recognition, after 36 years of such valuable
service. It is a reflection to find the faithful and able
efforts of a public man so ungenerously rewarded.
In the army, the navy, the civil service—in almost
every walk of life—the ancient is retired when he
becomes too old to be reliable. But even when
the politician is doddering on the rim of his 90th
year he calls it black ingratitude that the people
will no longer trust his palsied hand at the wheel,
and his rheumy eye on the outlook, and his failing
intellect on the bridge, and be satisfiied to see his
cataract of white whiskers streaming over the
deck. He thinks every Methusaleh should be
superannuated save himself.
The Rev. Robinson’s Melbourne “record
Bazaar ” art-union carries what looks like the solidest art-
union prize ever offered in Australia. “Athol Park,’*
which looks out to Coogee on to the ocean, and is alleged
to have originally cost £BOOO, goes to the first-prize taker.
Presumably to give the winner a chance to look up an
heiress who will pay for keeping up the establishment,
Father Robinson throws in a Ist return ticket to London.*

A picture of a great Tory statesman :
To see Premier Bent at his best—or worst—one wants
to spot him as he emerges from his favorite hash-foundry
in Swanston-street, Melbourne, about 7 p.m. He has
fully sti ked himself, and to keep the lower storeys of the
edifice steady, so to speak, he piles on a few wafers or
crackers as he meanders up Bourke-street. These he
tosses into his jaws and munches steadily, the while plod-
ding heavily on. The massive carcase sways from side to
side, threatening every moment to capsize, especially as
the brief right leg seems more bent than its mate. His
belltopper is ill-balanced, and he perpetually mops his
face and neck. Passing the Victorian Club and the
Palace the spielers and magsmen there congregated nudge
one another and grin ; one or two venture a “ Good night,
Mr. Bent.” Bent nods without looking; perspiring, puff-
ing stodgily onwards. No one stops and speaks to him.
The shopkeepers shrug their shoulders and laugh : “ It’s
only Tommy—Tommy Bent.”

“ A Bush Honeymoon” and other stories (there
are some 33 of the other), by Laura Palmer Archer,
is on the market. A very attractive flock of tales
and sketches of Australian life. Mrs. Archer s
knowledge of Queensland station life covers a con-
siderable area, and she writes of wliat she knows
with sympathy and humor. Most of thesestoncs
have appeared in the Australasian. Rolf Boldie-
wood contributes a flattering preface.
Two N.S.W. teachers, during the patriotic era
in our history, two or three years ago, made a
small bet as to which of them would obtain the
higher skill mark from the inspector. One of them
worked like a nigger, the other like two niggers ;
but No. 1 hit upon the expedient of placing a
photo, of the Queen in his school and surrounding
it with the Union Jack, and he won in a canter !
There were some historic Australian names at
the marriage, the other day, of Rev. John Elkin,
of Abbotsford, to Mrs. Reibey-Meredith. The
bride is a daughter of the late Wm. Hannibal
Lane, of Christchurch (M.L.), and widow of
Richard Reibey-Meredith, of Beaumaris station.
The head of the Merediths arrived in Hobart m
1821. His son, Charles Meredith, became pro-
minent in political life, having been Trea-
surer on several occasions. The Reibeys are
old in New South Wales and Tasmania, the grand-
mother of the present Thomas Reibey having
arrived in Sydney about the year 1790. Her son
Tom went to Van Diemen’s Land in Macquarie’s
time, with a big land grant in his pocket, and
settled on the island, where Tom 111. now lives,
aged 80 odd.
What an awful occupation that of a tram-driver
must be for any but a man with buffalo-hide
nerves! Some weeks ago a nerve-wrecked tram-
driver started for Maonland for a holiday. On
the voyage his mind quite gave way, and, of
course, M.L. would not let him land. On the
return voyage the poor fellew —he was locked in
liis cabin—hanged himself, and was buried at sea.
Prof. Anderson Stuart has accomplished at least
part of his mission to England. He has secured a
matron for Sydney Prince Alfred Hospital. The
Prof.’s mission looked, for a time, as difficult as
that of Col. Younghusband to Thibet. The lady
is Miss Mabel Newill, and the dread council of
selection met at the Agent-General’s office, where
she struggled through the needle’s eye ahead of
the other 22 candidates. At present Miss Newill
is something at Brompton Hospital for Consump-
tion. The Professor can now devote all his
energies to hunting for a title.
Sydney photographers’ windows are giving their
best panes to the portraits of the new Gov.-Gen.,
consort and staff, and the new Prime Minister.
A party of female Mossifaces paused opposite the
vice-regal group lately and studied the figures in a
silence that was broken by but one comment: “I
like ’er —but as for the men, I wouldn’t care to
have enny wan of them callin’ fer me on my Sun-
days off. If I did ’ave a chice I’d take the wan
w’ose trousis fits ’im. All the rest is in slop
pants.” Then they turned to Mr. Watson’s
portrait—a bust—and were unanimous in say-
ing that he had “ a nice face,” but that
“he didn’t look as if he could fight.”
Mama Mossiface turned to her following and
added, “Every man that goes into Parlia-
ment and gets on there wants a fyce like
tins ” —she thrust out her strong lower jaw and
made a really good chimpanzee countenance. It
liberalises our education to hear opinions of our-
selves.
A fashionable boy baby had a tony christening
last month in our metropolis, and, as his parents
ar.e rich, he, of course, got a lot of valuable pre-
sents. One of his uncles, a spiky old bachelor,
declined to come to the ceremony, but sent as his
present a gorgeous shaving mirror, mug, and
razors, and three little booklets— “ A Treatise on
Billiards.” “ Hints about Racehorses,” and “Ball-
room Etiquette for Gentlemen.” Strangely
enough, baby’s mama threw the books into the
fire, but put a card, inscribed “ From Baby’s
Loving Uncle Joe,” on the silver things.
Our sometime visitor, that mysterious, pictur-
esque “Right Hon. and Right Rev. Monsignor
Count Vay de Vaya” (and the rest), has been
telling Pearson’s how he interviewed such large
deer as the Czar and the Dowager-Empress of
China. The count’s literary style is simple to the
verge of the nursery-narrative type, and of the
account of the meeting with the terrible old
Empress her words make the best reading.
The diplomatic representatives of the foreign
powers stood in a row before the throne, and
the leader spoke a long, cordial and very
flattering speech. Prince Ching translated, add-
ing more decorations, and presented to her the
butter of grovel on a lordly dish. She listened in un-
winking silence, then ordered her reply to be read.
“ The Empress is glad that the representatives of
the Powers have had such a favorable day for
their visit.” That was all. Was the weather
ever before turned to more diplomatic account !
In the preface to his series of “audiences,” we
are told that Yay de Yaya—it sounds mightily like
Yere de Vere—delivered no fewer than 363
sermons, lectures and addresses during his nine
months stay in Australasia. This is, of course, a
very large red fox. He didn't speak at all in
Eublic, that I know of, in Sydney. And although
e camped as guest with both the Teniiysons and
Rawsons, the Cardinal and Archbishop Carr gave
him quite the cold cassock. He was curiously fond
of appearing in his fine priestly robes with medals,
crosses, and stars on his breast, and he used to
carry the togs and orders about with him in a
brown-paper parcel, and put them on in season
and out of season. Report says he once got into
official array on a city footpath. Anyhow, he and
his paper-parcel once called at Riverview College
whilst the community was at dinner. The Prin-
cipal left him alone for a moment to order a place
to be set for the guest, and when he returned the
noble priest was in State dress. If he cannot
write or speak very well, Monsignor is a good
lightning change artist.
My Melbourne correspondent continues
“ A Melbourne touriste who has been doing
Paris m an artistic spirit, writes her emphatic
annoyance at the Yank shopper: ‘ These pork and
pickle heiresses are overwhelming. Their one
aim is clothes. From the time of the coffee-roll
to the midnight cock-tail, the one occupation,
thought, and interest is dress. All day long they
whirl from shop to shop, amassing tons of superb
personal effects and those individualistic creations
that the successors of Worth pride themselves on
exchanging for the mighty dollar. The Yank
girl is a clothes-fiend—and Paris is her only faith,
one is anathema to the art-loving. 5 -
A high-toned section of a religious flock is
exercised as to the lack of frill displayed in their
nearly-new chief shepherd’s domestic arrange-
ments. His Reverence, ’tissaid, welcomes dinner
guests to homely joint and vegetables, the diners
passing their own plates for second helps in good,
old family style. The good man’s predecessor-in-
affice, it seems, regarded spruce handmaidens as
necessary. One extra-high-stepping prelate added
to the dignity of the official fold by a haughty
male flunkey, who illustrated the ‘ camel-through-
the-needle’s-eye ’• parable every time he admitted
a visitor through the jealously-guarded front-
door.
“ One of the Hopetouns’ ex-carriage-horses now
grafts between the shafts of a wood-cart in a Mel-
bourne suburb. The big chestnut was imported
by Hopey at a cost of £2OO. He seems fairly con-
tented at present. Maybe he prefers wood-yard
society to some of the folks he met at Govern-
ment House.
“ There is a Mr. Jim Osborne (something of a
seasoned charmer) in Melbourne owning first-
cousinship to the gentleman who stands as the
affianced of Miss Jeffries. The Melbourne Osborne
is a somewhat sensational sport. He has a heap
of trophies, scored at every branch of athletics
under the Australian sun.
“Same newspaper which announced the birth
of Hon. Mrs. Lindsay’s first-born (a daughter),
also contained the notice of young Mr. Newbigin’s
death. Both events occurred on May 6. Last
time Mrs. Lindsay, then Miss Mary Clarke, of
Cliveden, cropped up in the same streak of hap-
penings as the late Newbigin, junior, was when
returning from the Durbar. That trip, Mr. New-
bigin developed smallpox on the eve of arriving in
Melbourne, with the result that Miss Clarke, with
the rest of the patient’s shipmates, was landed in
Quarantine. The Clarke Miss had just got en-
gaged to the captain (now her husband), the son
of an Earl, no less. To her relatives, thirsting
for details of the capture, her detention at such a
time seemed maddening. Fortunately, the
prisoner took the delay more calmly than her im-
Eatient kinsfolk, and occupied her time writing to
>u chesses and such, who had shown her hospi-
tality while abroad. By way, no doubt, of sharing
as far as possible her social advantages with her
fellow captives, the tireless correspondent made a
practice of asking this one and that to post her
highly-destined missives.
“ The parental Newbigins have had their share
of trouble. A while ago their daughter—a
sprightly, dark-eyed Miss, though less of an
acknowledged belle than her sister, the graceful
Mrs. Willie Robb —married and settled in Ceylon,
only to die after a short experience of wedded
happiness, leaving a tiny baby.
“ A woman, who always did look well at com-
Saratively small cost, has just returned from a
iuropean jaunt, freshly rubbed-up and renovated
as to sartorial instincts and intuitions. ‘Black,’
she says, ‘ the very best black, is the only wear for
a pauper with dress aspirations beyond her purse.’
Sartorial sages always have realised the value of
black. Once upon a time they looked dignified in
black velvet and point lace or staunch black silk
with real net tuckers. Now silken, subtle, cling-
ing material is the idea. Our toilette expert has
brought back an inky-hued creation with two
bodices—one for evening, t’other for day wear.
Three underskirts were sent home with the
gown, a trim, black silk-taffeta affair for
slip-slop weather, and a rose silk for evening,
and a foam of white muslin and lace for
sunshiny shivoos. No tan shades are worn in
gloves, only black, pale-grey or white. Suedes of
the very best quality are recommended. Women
wash their own hand-wear, nowadays, not with
benzine but with the best white-curd soap and
water. Put them on your hands and dabble perse-
veringly, but don’t rub. In the last water put a
teaspoonful of glycerine, then hang the paw-bags
up to dry.
Parsons may say what they like, but I can’t
believe that women are responsible for the declin-
ing birth-rate. In a big city-shop, t’other day,
the whole costume-staff seemed en fete because a
customer, while being fitted-on, had handed over
her girl-baby, just beginning to talk, to the care
of the ‘ young ladies.’ Those girls clustered round
the child like bees round honey. Even attendants
at remote tables wistfully eyed the little thing as
she queened it, mounted on a counter. To one
another they remarked sotto voce, ‘how sweet’
and ‘ lovely.’ It was all genuine, for there wasn’t
a man to be impressed nearer than the next floor.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
A casual bishop named Ridley offers,
as a solution of the White Australia diffi-
culty (where is the difficulty?), that a line be
drawn on the map, to the north of which colored
aliens could come, and south of which they must
not trespass. This solution was originally tried
for the tick problem. Learned men, in conference
assembled, drew a line across Queensland, south of
which the tick was not to dare venture. The tick
was not present at the conference, and not being a
consenting party has kept coming south ever
since. The line on the map has already been
shifted two or three times, and the tick still laughs
a metallic laugh and comes on southward. The
bishop doesn’t say who is to stand on his line and
shoo the nigger back.
“ W.” : Lately I’ve been for eight months
in one or other of our Sydney hospitals.
Most of the inmates were, like myself, men of the
industrial class. What I noticed most was the
ease with which I picked out the trades-unionist.
He was usually able to speak on one other subject
than his stomach. He read the papers and re-
jected what appeared to him as padding and the
incidental lies in support of the paper’s “policy.”
But the others, the men who had never been m a
trades-union —what dolts they were ! Their con-
versation floated from two-up to the Melbourne
Cup winner, but seldom further. When they did
light upon a topic of political or social import their
only refuge was, “Well, the Tellygraff says so,
anyhow,” or “I see by the paper that George
Reid’s going to win easy,” or “I ain’t going to
vote for Buggins, the paper says he’s a Jesuit m
disguise,” and so on.

The man is dead, his bones are lime.

The nation is a Painted Show,
That boasts about its Long Ago.
The book is closed for those who say
“ You should have seen us Yesterday.”
The paper should expire that week
Which says, “ This issue is unique.”
The scribe who says, “ I used to write,”
Does then his epitaph indite.
The man or race that says, “ To-day
Is ours ; behold me ! ” must decay.
The man or race will take the throne
That says “ To-morrow is my own.”
They praised the past in prose and rhyme—
Manana is the golden time.

The favored child of poetry.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
... outcome of BobSievier Sutton’s abortive
libel actiQn is very distressing. He has been warned off
the English turf by the autocratic Jockey Club and the
places where the “owner of Sceptre” used to raise his
hat to the hoorooing multitude will know him no more
All because a detective testified that Sievier is known to
the pol ice as an associate of card-sharpers and an all-round
trickster. The same detective could doubtless have given
similar evidence against men who loom large in the holv
Jockey Club circle. Numbers of noble earls and suchlike

Williamstown (Melb.) Racing Club has struck a
new device for “ queering” the game of the town book-
maker and his stay-at-home punters. The numbers of
non-starters are not withdrawn from the scratching board
until shortly before the time for each race, consequently
the town book ’’ is kept in the dark—whereas under the
old arrangement he got the names of starters wired to
him half an hour beforehand, and his clients bet accord-
ing-ly. But what is sauce for the absentees is almost the
same sauce for bookmakers and backers on the spot
They likewise are kept in the dark to a great extent. It
may be argued that they are in a position to learn what
horses are going for a race without consulting the hoard.
.b i lls p as much as can be learned on the course can be
wired to town. The new Williamstown “check” is an
absurd thing.

Lack of originality in turf nomenclature is
lamentable. There are no less than nine nags named
Blue Bell running this season.

Sydney bookmakers are complaining that they
have been too liberal in the way of odds lately, and that
in two or three instances at Randwick Saturday week’
they were betting to almost certain loss. The Bulletin
fails to see where anything like “ certain loss ” can come
in with two or three others almost equally as well backed
as the favorite in each event, and only a point longer in
price. For instance, at Tatt.’s meeting, where the big
risk is said to have been run, Mo. laid 3 to 1 each The
Mite (winner) and Driscoll, 4 to 1 Jacobin, and 5 to 1 each
Commissioner and Toonga for the Hurdles. Flying
Handicap saw him lay 5 to 2 Camira (winner), 9 to 2 Ibex
and sto 1 Suivre, both losers heavily backed. Though Cakel
walk (winner) was at 2 to 1 for Tatt.’s Stakes, Bright Star
saw 6 to 4, and started at 5 to 2, carrying heaps of coin.
Winter Stakes b itting was very close ; winner, Lamrock
lined up 5 to 2 against, with The Relic 7 to 2, and
Barindi and Carragheen 9 to 2 each, all weightily sup-
ported. For Welter Handicap, Ninyas (winner) was at 2
to 1, with Praleen (for long 6 to 4 and even money) 9 to 4
and several others fancied. Prices now offered make the
layer more than safe, unless in isolated instances where
big money is laid against a successful outsider.

The bitterness of it. After recent Onkaparinga
race meeting, owner of forefront ’chaser Tom Brown was
offered £3OO for his nag, and asked £2OO more. At subse-
quent Morphettville races Tom Brown was killed.
M.L. horse racing is coming on at a great rate.
New Zealand Cup stake has been increased to £2OOO of
which second nag gets £3OO and third £2OO. Grand
National ’Chase prize will, in future, be £lOOO (£250 more
than ever previously given for a leaping event in ML)
and that for Grand National Hurdles £7OO.

Queensland turf authorities are putting the
screw on Mo. tighter than ever, and, though he kicks and
squirms as he always does, he keeps on in the same
luxurious groove. Latest infliction (which has caused a
tremendous howl) is a charge of 40gs. each for the privilege
of betting at Charters Towers two days’ meeting. Books
threaten to strike, but that’s the usual thing—they never
go further than threatening and will disgorge sooner than
miss the opportunity to bet. In Victoria, too, increased
fees are being exacted, and there also the hook-nosed vow
they’ll stay away sooner than submit. N.S. W. is the only
State where the raucous-voiced are never molested, and it
is indeed a land of milk and honey for them.

liberal allowance made for depreciation, a net profit of
£5288 had resulted. At the three meetings held £6600

out previous 12 months, and since last annual meeting
£20,296 had been spent in improvements.

Queensland St. Leger (Saturday), as most
people expected, fell to Fitz Grafton, who dashed away
and passed the judge easily ten lengths to the good in
3min. 16Jsec —one of the fastest races ever run in

2 to 1 were laid on Fitz Grafton with the “ books,” and
tote paid 13s. for every 10s. invested.

The Forbes (N.S.W.) Farmers’ and Settlers’
Association has decided to hold a picnic race meeting on
the old Wowingragong racecourse on an early day. The
old course is historic. It was here, in the early sixties,
that Ben Hall, Dunn and Gilbert waited at the back of the
course to get a pot-shot at Inspector Frederick Pot-
tinger whose horse, Bushranger, was entered for the
principal event. The ’rangers, to whom he was personally
unknown, expected to see him ride in police uniform,
whereas he rode in his racing colors, so they let him pass
unheeded.

A recent bull-fight at Bordeaux appears to have
been a more stirring conflict (on the bull’s part) than the
other animals had bargained for. A matador drew first
blood by sticking a sword into his intended victim, but
the bull indignantly tossed the sword out of his shoulder
and had the satisfaction of seeing it drop, point down-
wards, into the countenance of a Spanish naval person,
who was present as a guest of the management. The dis-
tinguished foreigner had to retire to the nearest hospital,
and meanwhile the bull scored some clever horn-drives in
the ribs and legs of a torero. Then the audience tore up
the seating accommodation and threw it at the bull, from
a safe distance, protesting that the hired slaughterers
were frauds. Finally the bull trotted back to his dressing
room, bleeding but triumphant, and the performance was
rung off.

The big deficit incurred by Warner’s cricket
team on the last Australian tour is attributed by the
manager largely to the abolition of the distinctions be-
tween amateurs and professionals. “ Hitherto it has been
the practice for the amateurs to stay at the best hotels,
and for the professionals to put up with less pretentious
places. During the last tour, however, all the players
have been treated alike in this respect. The difference
between ‘ boarding ’ six men in first-class style and eight
others in, so to speak, third-class fashion, and boarding
fourteen men in first-class mode, would, in a few months,
amount to a formidable sum. Add to this the extra
charge for superior class railway fares, and there one has
a potent factor, if not the actual cause, of the deficit.”
J. J. Lyons, the one time cricketer and champion
hard hitter, passed his 41st birthday on 21st May. There
is no hope of Jack ever taking to the game seriously again.
The natives of Keoato, near Samarai, are the
champion cricketers of Papua. A missionary man, known
as the Rev. C. W. Abel, has coached them, and the native
team recently drubbed an eleven picked from the mis-
sionary whites by seven wickets and nine runs. The
niggers scored 117 and 31 for three wickets, and the
preachers 54 and 85.
Albert Knight, a. member of Warner’s cricket
, ls reported in S.A. Advertiser as having said:
Th ® howling of the crowd (in Sydney) reminded me of
the dog Cerberus barking at the gates of hell.” Now

Joe Darling is back in Adelaide, but he explains
that, though he may play in club cricket, he will have to
be over in Tasmania for the shearing in November and
December (he hasn’t given up his farm), so they must not

Mrs. Major Taylor took her Ma degree in Aus-
tralia, and with her husband and infant daughter will
leave for U.S.A. early in June. On Monday, Orlando
Stevens, F. H. Scheps and W. Palmer left on a racing
tour. Scheps is not likely to go to the World’s Cham
pionship meeting, but will seek the substantial dollar at
the judge s pistol mouth in the land where the successful
merchant wrote those remarkable letters to his son about
how to make hogs pay.

Next season’s cycling prospects are looking very
bright in Melbourne. The new track at the Exhibition
Oval is to be completed in good time ; and rumor has it
that an enterprising sports promoter is going to create a
Melbourne Thousand, handicap, of which the first prize
will be £5OO. This will leave £250 more for the other
placed men than in the Sydney affair.

Now that road-racing has commenced in deadly
earnest, it is well to get a horse which does not look upon
the flying bike as an enemy. On the roads round Sydney
the scorcher is abroad, and the road-racer is being paced,
and it’s safest to keep on the grass. P. J. Goatley,
of the Marrickville Club, did the fastest time
in the ten miles paced race, although he was only
placed fourth. Starting from scratch, he got over it
in 29min. 6sec. Annandale’s fastest man did five miles in
14mm. 45sec. Considering it is the start of the season
and the men are not supposed to be in good fettle, these
times are not too bad, and they will be vastly improved
upon in a few weeks.

Already 13 clubs have notified their intention of
entering teams for the Dunlop inter-club championship.
The first racing will take place on June 11, and after that
further proceedings will ensue on alternate Saturdays till
the shield is won. At present, the trophy is in the hands
of the North Sydney Club, whose team won it last year.
Balmain has also had it in its possession a year, and, as it
has to be won only twice to secure ownership, either of
these clubs has a good chance to be the ultimate possessor.

N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union has decided to prohibit
the re-entry, as amateurs, of men who have chased the
elusive dollar that flies along the professional track.
Hitherto the amateur wheeler has been allowed to turn
pro. just when it suited him, and then when he felt the
other way he was promptly re-admitted the ranks of the
amateurs. Now the Council has ukased that once a man
turns pro. he stays pro. for the rest of his natural life.

The Australian football game evidently forges
ahead. The three Deformers who are at present scragging
each other for the Darlinghurst nomination anxiously
make themselves prominent as patron (Lees), president
(Levy), and vice-president (Stephens) of the East Sydney
Australian Football Club. The politicians know which
way the ball bounces. And the Australian footballer
seems to be skilled in “ marking ” that shy bird, the com-
plimentary guinea.

The English footballers, now on their road to
’Stralia, count amongst their numbers two Maorilanders
A. B. O’Brien and P. M‘Evedy. They both belonged to
the Canterbury district; went to St. Patrick’s College,
Wellington, where they learnt their footer, and after-
wards played for Christchurch Boys’ High School. They
went to England to study medicine.

Sydney first-grade Rugby drew about 17,000
spectators to various grounds on Saturday afternoon.
Probably by next season Sydney Cricket Ground people
will realise that they made a grand mistake when they
fell out with the Rugby Union. Fully 9000 people
paid to watch the North Sydney v. Glebe struggle
at University Oval, while the Cricket Ground had
only a thin sprinkling, mostly ticket-holders, to
watch a game played under the Australian rules.
When the Lacrosse Association held its annual meet-
ing at the S.C.G. the vast array of empty stands and
the vacant hill had a most depressing effect, and took all
the glitter out of the function. Taken all round the play
on Saturday indicated that things had evened up
much. Interest was stimulated by the fact that in
most of the games there was a greater element
of uncertainty, and anything seemed possible. For-
wards have improved in speed, and backs show com-
bination. North Sydney forwards were as fleet as swallows
and South Sydney backs played a beautiful game of
machine-like precision. Dribbling was better all round
than on the previous Saturday, but kicking was not so
good ; the speed of the forward attack prevented good
touch-line kicks being made. The chief troubles now are
lack of combination among the forwards, slow picking-up
erratic kicking by backs, and neglect to take advantage
of opportunities to pot goals when chances of obtaining
tries are doubtful. North Sydney beat Glebe by Bto nil;
yet Glebe had three splendid chances to pot goals, and
threw them all away in a vain endeavor to press home for
tries when there was mighty little chance of getting them.
The fatal tendency to run across the field is still very
much in evidence ; when a player finds himself in that
predicament, he should promptly go for a touch-line kick.
It has just the same effect as if he had got through the
forward pack and been rushed out by the backs. He will
have gained the ground for his side and given his forwards
a breathing spell, and the fact that the other side has the
throw in doesn’t matter. Next to scoring, the best thing
is to keep the leather well in the enemy’s territory, and
good kicking is one of the ways of doing it.
A Sydney sporting paper denounces the refusal
of the Federal Defence Minister to send a rifle team to
Bisley (England) as neglecting Australian defence ! 1!
How providing free board and travelling exes for a team
of pot-hunters is going to increase the defensive power of
this loan continent was not explained. The provision of
one “ running man target ” for the use of school cadets
and rifle clubs will do more for Australian defence than
sending 10 teams to Bisley for the next 1000 years. As
the Minister said, every penny is required to provide arms
and shooting instruction here in the land we may have to
fight for. In modern battle 1000 men who can shoot well
are worth 10,000 who cannot. To make a nation mighty
in war time, train up the youth in the way they should
shoot, and when they are old they will not need to hit
with the butt end.

“ A. 8.” : Touching the statement that Sandow’s
prescription for Strong Men was “ to use his ‘ developer ’
for 10 minutes every day.” Sandow gave me to under-
stand something very different. He spoke slightingly of
the ‘ developer ’ as a health-promoting toy for people who
are not disposed to take the dumbbells, and as a desirable
adjunct to weight-lifting exercises. He never said that
the “ developer ” alone could convert a weak man into a
Samson. The first thing he did after his arrival in Mel-
bourne was to put an ad. in the dailies to the effect that
the “ developer ” was a small matter in the system as
compared with grip dumbbells. Sandow’s pupil and
assistant, James Young, gave some beautiful exhibitions
of exercises in which there was no “ developer ” and no
heavy-weight-lifting.

The record for swimming under water has lately
been broken in Melbourne, but owing to the painful cir-
cumstances of the case the effort is never likely to receive
official recognition. It happened at the annual sea-side
picnic of a very large soft-goods firm. The men were
mostly swimming, and the boss, feeling that it was an
occasion when the distinctions of rank should be laid
aside, ungirded his loins, and lowered himself carefully
into eight feet of water. In the water a nude boss looks
very like any other man, so the youngest commercial
traveller mistook the back view of him for that of Bill, the
packer, and hit him a tremendous smite on the hinder
portion, making it blush like a full moon. The boss’s
yell, and his wild threats to disinherit the man who
slapped him, revealed to the youngest bagman the full
horror of the situation, and he dived for his life, or at
least for his job, and fled under water in order to establish
an alibi. He only re-appeared at the far end of the big
bath, and there he watched the corpulent guv’nor indig-
nantly climbing out with the brand of his recent anguish
red upon him. Yet owing to the absence of time-keepers,
referee and other sordid excrescences, nothing can be
done to preserve this record, which is said to beat any-
thing previously heard of by five yards.

Looks as if the girls are going to make further
swimming history for Australia. Atop of Miss Keller-
man’s recent fine performance in the smellful Yarra
comes the performance of Miss Liddell (aged 16) at Spring
Hill Baths, Brisbane, on Saturday, when she covered '2lm.
in lh. 59m. 32s.—the longest distance ever negotiated by

As expected, the fight between Jack McGowan
of Melbourne and Tasmanian lightweight champion Billy
Maher, at Ballarat, last Friday, was a sanguinary struggle
and was eventually stopped by the police. Ballarat has
seen some awful fights and this was about the most whirl-
ing of them all. Maher had the better of things mostly,
but in the fourth round Mac. slogged him on the cheek
and the gore spurted out. Another frightful bash on the
nose increased the flow, and then Maher swiped like a
windmill and sent McGowan to the boards for six seconds
ere corners. Then a violent impact with Maher’s elbow
broke McGowan’s arm and the dwarfed giant became a
target but kept g'oing till the 11th round when the police
stopped the fight. If this isn’t McGowan’s last appearance it
ought to be ; a man who has reared two families and been
punching and punched for 20 years is due for honorable
retirement, but presumably McGowan has not made a
fortune at the game and will go on fighting for the money
there is in it till he is finally slugged out.

Sydney’s Golden Gate and Gaiety Athletic
Clubs have settled down to the business of pug nurseries,
or bruiser plantations, and for some time past both clubs
have been running “Novice Tournaments. 1 ” There is
more gore for the performers and fun for the audience in
a novice tournament ” than in high-class scraps between
recognised professionals. The N.T. is full of uninten-
tional burlesque and humorous incidents to the on-
lookers, but to the raw youths in ancient socks in the ring
the whole business is full of dark tragedy. Some of them
get unmerciful bumps, and occasionally a youth g*ets such
a walloping that even the mention of a bruising club
makes him feel bad about the diaphragm. The Golden
Gate brought its “tournament” to a close on Saturday
night, when a husky youth named Matthews was, after a
couple of lively final scraps, declared winner, and left the
hall amid many congratulations. He looked as though
he felt that it was better to acquire fame in the G.G. ring
than die unhonored and unsung in even a Potts Point
boarding-house. And who knows?

The Cooper-Flemming meeting at Sydney
National Sporting Club last week was mostly a mauling
wrestle. Flemming seemed to have the best of it till
near the end of the first round, when a stinging right on
the jaw sent him staggering. Then he hung on like a
bottle of leeches, and they both clung and shoved and
hustled in turn and together. Flemming certainly
seemed the worse offender, but he also had the best of
whatever thumping there was. In the fourth round the
referee disqualified Flemming, who then lost his head,
and had to be held down by his seconds and friends. He
evidently feels very sore on the subject, as he has gone to
work, declaring he will never fight again. And when the
pug goes to work he is disgusted.
* * * *
Great stand made by Tom Dunn, in his sensa-
sational and generally wholly unexpected triumph over
little Britisher Jessop at Kalgoorlie recently still provides
subject matter for sporting scribes. Dunn possesses a
right-hand punch liable to land any time as long as he
keeps the perpendicular; it may get home in the first
round, or it may not find an opening till the tenth, but once
it does make contact the effect is marked, and the man
who gets it fair must go; a clever boxer, however,
shouldn’t let the blow reach him. Jessop’s carelessness
and contempt for the enemy proved his undoing ; if they
fought again a different story might be told. Dunn
fights “Hock” Keys next at Sydney National 5.0., and
will probably lose on points, for Keys’ cleverness should
stand that right off always.

The wrestling boom grows. N.S.W. Sports
Club is arranging to bring off a tournament for the
amateur championships of the continent on or about July
7. The club has drafted an extensive code of rules, con-
ditions and definitions which seem to safeguard the show
from any possibility of fraud, professionalism or brutality.
A big entry should result. The amateur boxing cham-
pionships will be carried out at the same time, and, alto-
gether, July promises to be an exciting month in the
sporting world.

That the Towns-Tresidder sculling match has
now reached the stage of signed articles and cash deposit
is due to the persistency and self-sacrifice of Tresidder.
Towns seems to have been desperately anxious to avoid a
meeting, and his treatment of his challenger is as bad as,
if not worse than, that which he himself received from
Jake Gaudaur, and about which he complained so bitterly.
The final and nearly fatal disagreement was a dispute over
a difference of a week in the date. Towns said July 30 ;
Tresidder wanted a week later, alleging that he could not
be in condition by July 30, and that August 6th, being
pay-day in Newcastle, meant a big increase in the
steamer takings. To all of which Towns replied in a spirit
of crass obstinacy : “I have had my say, and I won’t
depart from it. ... I have got the championship in my
hands, and I’m going to keep it as long as I can.” In
order to avoid missing the match, Tresidder gave way
and agreed to race on July 30. The meeting is for £5OO
a-side, championship of Australia and the World, and if
Towns loses he is to get 75 per cent, of the net steamer-
takings. If Tresidder loses he will only get 50 per cent,
of the loot. Seems almost a pity, from a business stand-
point, that Towns didn’t ask for the lot. Even meanness
ought to be complete.

Sydney Kensington Coursing Club’s two days’
meet last week was at least as successful as any previous
venture by the same body. Hares stood up remarkably
well, and dogs were in prime fix, but the gate was bad,
and the club is said to have lost. Coursing never was a
big public attraction in Australia. Years ago when dogs
were, perhaps, better than now and wealthy men sup-
ported the game, even to the extent of arranging a sweep-
stake of eight different dogs from different sections of the
continent at £5OO each, people generally didn’t enthuse
much over the sport and there’s little difference now.
The same old faces (a good many certainly) are in evidence
every time, and, while backers complain that the betting
is no good to them, a similar growl is heard from Ikey,
and as a rule only the “outside” division of him takes
coursing on. Winner (Clarence Mangan) of principal
event was originally let in by the owner of the runner-up,
Carbineer (a hot favorite all through and for the final),
withdrawing a nomination, and one of Clarence Mangan’s
get (Debonair) ran up in the deciding course of the
Maiden Stakes.

Pedestrianism booms in Brisbane. For the
current Brisbane £lOO handicap, starts have been allotted
to 132 peds., entered from every State of the Common-
wealth, and even from Maoriland. A name that strikes
the eye and sets memory ajog is “ C. Samuels (a), Dalby,”
on 13J yards. If this is the old-time flier he must be get-
ting rather ancient for the game.

“Bung”: The inconsistency of the law as
represented by Constable X. If one man’s nose bleeds
freely a fight is stopped, but in the first round of Rugby
Premiership matches the ambulance was requisitioned
eight or nine times for players more or less badly injured
—one match alone produced four casualties, but the
police didn’t stop that fight, nor did the onlooking goody-
good hold up their hands in holy horror. A wound suffered
by one player necessitated 16 stitches. It isn’t on record
that anything like such a rent was ever made in any man’s
body during - a fist-fight, but writer on that account doesn’t
condemn the sport—the kick is against the set made on
boxing, which is mild compared with Rugby.

Present English amateur top-notch distance
runner, Shrubb, is heaps better than any who have pre-
ceded him. Standing records are nothing to Shrubb.
Within past couple of seasons he has created new world’s
figures IJ, 2,3, and 4 miles and the cable told late last
week that he had knocked out another previous best
(Sid Thomas’ 24.53 2-5 for sm. set up in 1892) by getting
over the ground in 24.33 2-5. Atop of these distinctions
Shrubb owns the English and International Cross Country
Championships.

Everybody who rides a bike is interested in
literature dealing with tyres, and should promptly apply
for the 48-page “ All about Dunlop Tyres,” which has just
been issued by the enterprising co. whose name it bears.
The publication this season devotes a considerable amount
of space to motor t} r res. There are special advantages
about using Dunlop tyres and rims, and they are all set
forth in detail in the handsome little publication which
the Dunlop Tyre Co. will post to anyone upon application.
A venerable and somewhat pompous
M.L.C. recently drove back to his club at 1 a.m.
and ordered a bed in tones of grumpy anger. He
explained that he reached home at midnight, but
his daughter, who has joined some sort of White
Cross society, had locked him out. She has fixed
10 p.m. as the right hour for pa to be home.
The bitterest foe of the Watson Ministry
is Bigjohn Forrest, who wants the people of
Westralia to believe that their interests are in
jeopardy while he is not a member of the Austra-
lian Government. When Watson announced last
week that the Westralian Government had pro-
mised to treat the Commonwealth liberally in con-
tributing towards any loss through the Trans-con-
tinental railway, John looked like a man
sitting on a cactus hedge. The Watson Govern-
ment had done more for the railway in three
weeks than Bigjohn, with all his bluster, had done
in three years.
This was the final appeal made to Riverina
electors by J. M. Chanter’s Wentworth Com-
mittee :
Remember, Prime Minister Watson, that prince cf
Labor leaders, appeals to you to return another supporter
to assist him to carry out the democratic legislation he
has taken in hand.
And Riverina did. Of course the Sydney dailies
haven’t mentioned this as proof of what the coun-
try thinks of the Watson Ministry. Yet when G.
H. Reid appealed to, and was elected by, East
Sydney a few months ago, they demanded to
know how, in the face of this clear expression of
the people’s will, the Deakin crowd could remain
a day longer in office.
It has been decided by the Full Court of
S.A. that a man who is fired at by a plain clothes
constable has a right to shoot back if not engaged
in wrongdoing at the time. Three men were
approached by three constables (out of uniform)
on the river bank outside Adelaide, and forthwith
ran (possibly they took the constables for credi-
tors). They were chased on suspicion, and scat-
tered. One trooper singled out a fugitive and
fired at, or towards, him across the Torrens. Shots
returned. Nobody hurt. Prisoner taken, and
convicted of “firing to prevent lawful arrest
subject to the point of law now decided in his
favor. The court held that one is not bound to
surrender to any unknown person or push that
may chase him, and that when he is shot at by a
person who may be an officer or a lunatic or a
criminal he has certain rights of self-defence.
Melbourne for a little while forgot the
elections and Bent and the Reid-Deakin combine
in admiration of a scientific burglary. Three
gentlemen burglars having picked the Box Hill
branch of the E. S. and A. Bank as a desirable
field for operations, raided a blacksmith’s shoo for
tools, annexed some cushions from Bent’s railway
carriages to deaden all sound, then calmly
entered the bank, gagged and bound the sleep-
ing teller, and blew open the strong room and
the safe, with seven charges of nitro-glycerine.
The result of 90 minutes steady work was
£1760, in gold, silver and notes. Then they
cut the tyres of the teller’s bike, so that, if he
managed to break his bonds he shouldn’t follow
them too speedily, commandeered the manager’s
fast pony and trap, and drove away. If the bank
had spent £5O in laying underground electric
alarms on to the police station, a few hundred
yards away, it would probably not be now lament-
ing the loss of its good gold. (The Melbourne
Cemetery trustees saved their coin a while back
by a similar device, and the use of automatic
electric lights.) But the average bank is a con-
servative institution that only learns by experi-
ence, and not always then.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
stand alone as the best remedy for the cure of all
disorders arising from imperfect digestion. They
get at the cause where other so-called remedies
give only temporary relief, leaving the system in
worse condition than before. They touch the
liver, and make the stomach clean and pure,
assisting the nutritive and digestive organs in
properly assimilating the food. Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills are a perfect blood purifier and
a permanent and positive cure for biliousness,
indigestion, constipation headaches, sallow com-
plexion, liver and kidney troubles, piles, pimples,
boils and blotches, and for female ailments.

(Greener’s Representative),
The Gippsland coal-miners’ strike is over, after 16
months of manful struggle —the longest in Aus-
tralian strike-history. The strike pay all through
has been the very barest subsistence; for some
families it would not have amounted even to that
had it not been possible to add rabbits to the
larder and earn an odd shilling or two by wood-
cutting. The Vic. gold-miners gave no great
amount of support. Somehow there rarely is very
much affection between the metal-miner and the
coal-miner; and the Vic. gold-miner is in any
case not too enthusiastic a unionist —a lifetime
lived in bad air, often on miserable wages, has
knocked most of every sort of enthusiasm out of
him. The N.S.W. coal-miners provided most of
the strike pay ; but lately the N.S.W. coal-miners
haven’t had a good time themselves, and doubts
were also raised as to whether, under the Arbi-
tration law, they could make strike levies even for
the support of a Victorian struggle. In the end,
therefore, the Gippslanders were told that the
stream had run dry ; and this practically ended the
long effort. All that was left for the com-
mittee to do was to formally declare the
strike off, and authorise the men to get back
on the best terms offering.
While the “ storm in a teapot” (as B. R.
Wise called it) was raging as to the instructions
given by the N.S.W. Department of Justice to
withhold a warrant in a certain case, the S.M.
Herald gave special prominence to every letter
and paragraph which was against the Government
action. But when Mr. A. J. Gould, an ex-
Minister for Justice and an opponent of the
Government party, wrote, fully backing up the
Government’s action, the Herald put the letter
on an obscure page, among six columns of advts.
Yic. Water Supply Minister Swinburne
told the people of Hawthorn some unexpected
truths about Bent’s supporters of Kyabram and
elsewhere. Said he, referring to the irrigation
schemes of past days :
The landowners seemed to always expect the State to
come to their assistance, and never seemed to hold them-
selves responsible for the money advanced. . . Only one
municipal council in Australia had ever tried to repudiate
loans from private individuals, but when it came to loans
from the Government they had not the slightest com-
punction in trying to evade payment. . . The writing-
down, in ’93, of the Water Trust’s obligations was dis-
graceful.

PURE AND SIMPLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Says the organ of the Licensed Victuallers : “ Scotland
has no barmaids pure and simple.”
And where has little .Janet gone ?
What lord led Her astray ?
And where is dark-eyed Alison ?
And where is Mysie May ?
And where are-all the barmaids straight,
And pure as Highland snow,
■Whose smiles lit up the Gallowgate
A score of years ago ?
All gone ? A lie. It is not so,
They are both pure aand fair—
But who would into Scotland go
To find them simple there ?
C.R.
From “The Cynic’s Posy,” a book of
epigrams :
Manors make the man. Worth makes the woman.
When in doubt, go home.
A coquette is a harlot of the heart.
A lie in time saves nine.
“Marat” writes of the dwindling stock-
in-trade of a decayed clown :
George Reid is a back number. The snap has gone out
of his humor and the days of cheap beer and Poverty
Point are closing in on him. The globular clown will soon
he retailing to new cornermen, stories of big hits made
when his wit sparkled like a spieler’s diamond, and they
will sneer and buy him another pint out of sheer pity. I
listened to George the other day, and he joked frequently
and badly. The countenances of the listeners resembled
craters as they yawned ; and I saw the beginning of the
end. The man who builds his reputation on his humor
builds on mud. The clown has a meteoric existence
and goes by like a comet, leaving only a husk of a joke
behind him as a tail. If the brain is not equal to a fresh
crop of jests he falls hack in despair on the old ones, and
the discriminating galleryite throws the vegetable at him,
and his sun sets with a surprised yap. Reid’s decline is
more noticeable because his perception of the ridiculous
has left him completely. The true humorist is introspec-
tive, and is more keenly alive to the ridiculous in his
own actions than in the actions of others. Reid’s wobbly
manoeuvres between his hotel and Parliament House
during the Federal crisis, vainly expecting a message from
the Governor-General, while a tired continent jeered at
him, prove that the huge vanity of the decayed mummer
has settled on him like a punt of mud falling on to a
caterpillar. I think if Reid could only look back over his
zig-zag career, dotted with alleged mirth, broken pro-
mises and mighty deficits, he would hire a small damp
cave at Jenolan and hermitize for the rest of his days.

On the March.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
So the time seems come at last,
And the drums go rolling past,
And above them in the sunlight Labor’s banners
float and flow; s
They are marching with the sun,
But I look in vain for one
Of the men who fought for freedom more than
fifteen years ago.
They were men who did the work
Out at Blackall, Hay and Bourke —
They were men who fought the battle that the
world shall never know ;
And they vanished one by one
When their bitter task was done—
Men who worked and wrote for freedom more
than fifteen years ago.
Some are scattered, some are dead,
By the shanty and the shed,
In the lignum and the mulga, by the river running
low ;
And I often wish in vain
I could call them back again—
Mates of mine who fought for freedom more than
fifteen years ago.
From the country of their birth
Some have sailed and proved their worth ;
Some have died on distant deserts, some have
perished in the snow.
Some are gloomy, bitter men,
And I meet them now and then—
Men who’d give their lives for Labor more than
fifteen years ago!
Oh, the drums come back to me.
And they beat for victory,
But my heart is scarcely quickened, and I never
feel the glow;
For I’ve learnt the world since then,
And the hopelessness of men,
And the fire it burnt too fiercely more than fifteen
years ago.
Lucky you who still are young,
When the rebel war-hymn's sung,
And the sons of slaves are marching with their
faces all a-glow,
When the revolution comes
And the blood is on the drums —
Oh! I wish the storm had found me more than
fifteen years ago !
Bear the olden banner still!
Let the nations fight who will!
’Tis the flag of generations—flag that all the
peoples know;
And they’ll bear it, brave and red,
Over ancient rebel dead,
In the future to the finish as a thousand years ago !

ALWAYS GETTING
GOUGHS AND COLDS
“Always getting coughs and colds” is an
expression very common, when mothers meet,
in referring to their children. Because this
condition is so common, very little heed is
paid to it. Manifestly it indicates a condition
much below that degree of health which gives
us the power to resist coughs and colds. If
they are not resisted or not properly treated,
it is not long before they develop into some-
thing with a more serious grip on the body.
Coughs and colds are almost always fore-
runners of bronchitis, consumption and other
troubles of the lungs. If anyone you love is
always catching coughs and colds get Scott’s
Emulsion, and in a very short time you can
make his or her system strong enough to be
practically immune from coughs and colds,
and of course free from any of the graver
illnesses. Scott’s always does this, and it has
not failed to do it once in 30 years ! Here is
an encouraging story of a quick and perfect
recovery
Blue Spur, Lawrence, N.Z., July Bth, 1903.
Dear Sirs, —My little daughter, Irene, until
she was five years of age, had very little
appetite, and hardly
seemed to eat enough
to keep life together.
She was always getting
coughs and colds, and,
instead of getting on
she seemed to be going
back. The Doctor
advised me to give
her Scott’s Emulsion,
which I did straight
away. She is now
seven years of age,
and seems a different
child in every way,
_ has a good appetite,
IRENE HANCOCK, never gets weary and
tired, like she used to, and a cough or cold is
practically an unknown thing with her.
Yours truly,
(Mrs.) Sarah Handcock.

Where Sammy Grows.
This letter comes from Kyabram (Vie.), the cen-
tre of the great political family of begging farmers
who are always refusing to pay their just debts to
the Treasury, and crying for Socialistic aids from
the Government, and calling themselves the back-
bone of the country
About the merits or demerits of , t i? e , Kyabr
Reform programme the electors of Rodney apart o
an assertive clique of no account locally concern them-
selves not at all; but the fact is becoming apparent to the
residents in adjacent towns in the electorate, or on its
fringe—Tatura, Rushworth, Rochester, Shepparton, El-
more, Echuca, Tongala, Ardmond, and Dimboola—that
Kyabram, the hub of the movement, is the coming town
of the north-west. This is more by reason of its irrigation
supplies during the past drought spells than anything
else. When the bulk of the farmers of the State were at
their wits’ end to find fodder for their stock which
mostly died in the end after three times its value
had been eaten in time-payment fifth-rate straw sup-
plies at exorbitant rates —Kyabram, with. Sammy
Lancaster, M.L.A., to look after its interests
and grab public money on its behalf, was an oasis in the
wilderness. The cockies waxed wealthy by being adjacent
to the Water Trusts’ arteries, that have cost the whole of
the State as much as the price of a small war m repudiated
loans. The orchards round Kyabram were well irrigated
almost gratis, while the rich swindlers of the district re-
fused to pay their liabilities to the State, and left the city
artisan and the public servant to be taxed to make up for
their villanies, while with sickening hypocrisy these
sneak-thieves blattered about “ honest government. By
reason of their great cadge and steal theirs were the only
fruit supplies available ; and the amber cane and lucerne
patches made the land smile after the crops—-disposed of
at famine prices—were harvested. Now the cockies
round about are Reforming themselves 1 They’ are
building fine houses of brick on every hand. Kyabram
itself is spreading out. Property is on the rise ; an air of
prosperity, painfully absent in the towns around, is
asserting itself. Artisans in the building line are receiving
calls from their starvation patches to come along and
earn wages again. The cocky who intends building, after
repudiating his water-rate liabilities, sets the brickmaker
to work in a corner of his paddock where he thinks a
dam would be useful. Here the handler of mud moulds
his cubes, sun-dries them, then has a couple of nights
brilliant illumination —all on the premises, so to speak.
Then the bricklayer is called in, and so on till the new
domicile is erected. A German count, of high aristocratic
degree in his own country, has spent several thousands in
having a splendid home built on a large orchard he pur-
chased a few years back—one deserted just before the
Reform wave rose from the local dung-hill—and he has
brought his frou, young and commendable like himself,
to breathe the air of the locality, which is excellent but
for the smell of the Sammy Lancaster movement.
Local legend has it that there are 62 hat-racks
and 144 clothes stands on the Count’s premises.
Strange to say, well-irrigated Kyabram is bitterly opposed
to the extension of the irrigation scheme which now
reaches to its own back door and stops there. The
barrenness and starvation of other parts enhance the
value of Sammy Lancaster’s swindling oasis. When the
Mallee-Goulburn National Irrigation Channel becomes a
consummation—the success of the Labor party is the
only guarantee at present available that it ever will —the
monopoly of the past lean years that have put the
Kyabrampootras on their feet will be unknown. There-
fore Sammy and Co., being irrigated themselves, regard
all further irrigation as “ socialistic.”
The Coraraonwealth’s Colony
A local resident sends a few facts about British
Papua:—
The annual revenue raised is, in round figures, £13,000 ;
the expenditure, over £30,000 ; Australia has to provide
the balance required to make both ends meet.
Out of the £13,000 local revenue the present Acting-
Administrator, with his yacht, costs over £10,000. The
cost of upkeep of the Merrie England in 1902-1903 was
£7500.
Governor Robinson’s contributions to science and to
civilisation are probably cheap at £2000 per annum, but
to provide him with a yacht costing nearly £8000 is mis-
guided hospitality. In the early days, before the coast-
line was properly surveyed and charted, the Merrie
England was one of the few means of communication
between ports and stations and did some useful work.
Now things are entirely altered. The fine steamers of
Messrs. Burns, Philp and Oo., the Airlie and Guthrie, run
a six-weekly service calling at Samarai, Port Moresby,
Yule Island and Thursday Island, en route for Singapore.
There are two monthly steamers from Cooktown to
Samarai and Woodlark Island. Two small steamers run
every two or three weeks up the N.E. coast, and a
schooner chartered by the London Mission Society does a
six-weekly trip along the southern coast, calling at all
stations, and moreover there are five Government sailing
vessels, together with numerous whaleboats. The Merrie
England is now an absolutely unnecessary expense, simply
cruising about with the Governor and his suite.
By way of contrast, compare the pay of other members
of the service. The Government Secretary’s salary is
£500, the Treasurer’s £450, the Chief Medical Officer’s
£400, the senior Magistrate’s £400, while the Assistant
Magistrates are living (or dying) in malarial swamps on
handsome salaries varying from £175 to £200 a year.
No funds are “available” for any public improvements.
Not one farthing is devoted to educate the white and
half-caste children running wild about Samarai and Port
Moresby. The hospital at Port Moresby has not been
opened for lack of funds, and those on the Mambare River
and Samarai are closed for like reasons; and all this
because £8000 is wasted every year.
The Executive and Legislative Councils are composed of
a few Port Moresby officials, appointed by the Adminis-
trator to obey his ruling, while the 600 or 700 miners and
traders who are developing the country are without voice
or representation in these august assemblies of self-styled
“ Honorables.”
There are ugly reports of wholesale massacres by the
native constabulary, which for blood-curdling ferocity
would equal any Bulgarian atrocity, villages having been
burnt, and women brutally outraged by these bayonet-
armed myrmidons of the Law.
These civilising methods are adopted chiefly in the
North and North-Eastern divisions which at present are
in a state of dangerous unrest. Natives armed with
stolen rifles and shot guns are on the warpath, and within
the last month there have been several serious encounters
with the whites.
It need hardly be said that there is no public press in
Papua wherein these deplorable miscarriages of Justice
might be ventilated. The Territory is a closed book,
but it will soon be opened.
Oripps-Clark writes this well - founded com-
plaint :—
I inquired, recently, per medium of the Goulburn Penny
Post, which is an enthusiastic supporter of the yapping
Fed. rep. for Werriwa, why Conroy voted with the Labqr
party against his much-advertised principles. The Post
replied in a footnote that “ he wanted to kill the Bill and
the Government also, and therefore he voted for the
amendment,” which, of course, is an eminently satis-
factory explanation. But, in the following issue of the
Post, this noble sentiment appeared in the leader
“ A person who is perfectly willing to not only abandon
his principles at the beck of possibly a majority of one in
caucus, but to vote in the. House in a way he believes to
be wrong, comes perilously near to being a man without
principle, or, if the phrase be preferred, an unprincipled
man.”
This appears rather rough on its special pet, Conroy, until
it is explained that the Post is merely referring to the
detestable Labor party. My letter to the Post was also
answered by an indignant admirer, who addressed me
anonymously thus: —
“ Dere Sir, I notisd you letter rea Mr. Conroy in the
Peny Post an i mus say that it was writ entirely with out
any sence. Fools rush in angles fear to tred. I trust in
futre you will have a little comon sence and give you
uterances more consideraton befor making such a fool of
youself (Signed) Freetrader.”
Considering that the letter was posted without the
formality ®f a postage-stamp, the signature is_ rather
superfluous, but the letter itself is characteristic of
Conroy’s supporters, and is the clearest argument m hie
favor put forward by his friends to date. I intend to put
it up in a conspicuous place so that those who, like mj self,
are puzzled to square Conroy’s high-toned principles with
s recent vote may be enlightened.
The Bed Indian Assurance institution was
not left with much scalp by; the Victorian Royal
Commission; but, if the political operations of the
society had been fully investigated, it is freely
stated that its condition would have been even
more unpleasant. The former manager of the con-
cern in Melbourne, Mr. M‘Nair, wished to give
evidence before the Commission but was blocked.
Why? The allegations now made are that the
£5O paid through Peacock represented only a very
small proportion of the money distributed as bribes
by the agent of the 1.0. F., and that certain
Victorian State Ministers and present mem-
bers of the Federal Parliament received money
from Montague. One amusing yarn is told of
two recipients of bribes losing the money at cards
subsequently to the 1.0. F. man, who, it seems,
knew how to play. Federal Premier Watson has
been asked to take a hand in forcing on an inves-
tigation, as two members of his Parliament are
involved in the rumors current. Emphatically,
for the sake of Australian public life, tne matter
should be probed to the bottom. If there has
been more bribery the public has a right to know
of it, with a view to the punishment of the poli-
ticians and the society. There is, by the way, no
talk, so far, of any proceedings against the 1.0. F.
agent in connection with the last bribery matter.
The issue of a warrant and a demand for the fat
man’s extradition would be about the most direct
method of investigation.

Thomas C. Dawson, Secretary of U.S. Legation,
Brazil, discussing the suitability of the tropics for
white settlement, writes in the Popular Science
Monthly
It is an accepted commonplace of popular belief and
scientific discussion that the white man is not fitted for
the tropics—that European races cannot live and multiply
in the fertile regions near the equator. It is assumed as
a self-evident truism that the blacks or colored races can
best resist the climatic conditions. As to permanent
powers of reproduction and survival, the existing pre-
dominance of colored races, and the ill-health and dis-
satisfaction of newly-arrived whites only create a pre-
sumption—they do not conclusively prove anything. The
negroes may predominate in Jamaica, because black
immigration to that island was vastly more numerous
than white, and not because the whites who did go there
died out. No one can long travel and reside in Brazil
without noticing that white families are large and their
children healthy. A large proportion can trace their
descent to colonial times. Whites are preferred to
negroes, mulattoes, or Indians as laborers on the railroads
and coffee plantations, not only because they are more in-
telligent, but because they are stronger, healthier,
and more energetic. A white may be susceptible
to certain climatic diseases, but the negro
is less able to resist others, and is decimated
by such communicable maladies as small-pox and con-
sumption. The white eats more and better food, lives
more hygienically, and protects himself more effectually
against the weather. A study of the population statistics
of Brazil leads to some surprising conclusions. The
returns of marriages and births show that the whites are
more fecund. In 1890 an enumeration was made in the
city of Rio Janeiro. The average number of children in
families where both parents were white is given as 3'507,
while the black families produced only 2 987, and the
intermarriage of blacks and mulattoes 2*908. Of all the
children 75-2 per cent, were the offspring of parents who
were both white, leaving 24 - 8 per cent, for children of
mixed or colored blood. The total white population was
returned as (52’7 per cent., and the other races 517'3. It is
therefore clear in Rio, a sea-coast city whose climate is
particularly fatal to Europeans, whites are more prolific
than the black or mixed races.

“ Muru ” from Maoriland :
The fight—Freehold v. Leasehold—in M.L. is not of such
importance as one would imagine after reading the Tory
newspapers. The fact that seven-eighths of the Maonland
newspapers are Tory, and that the people persistently re-
turn a Liberal administration by an overwhelming ma-
jority, about sums up the influence of the Tory papers,
anjdiow. The leasehold is safe, because Premier Seddon
has threatened to appeal to the people if he is defeated in
the House on the question, and there are many exponents of
the freehold who are not hungering for an appeal to the
people. That child of the city money-lender, the Farmers’
Union, has supplied the most discordant howl for the
freehold, so far. The Union from the start lived up to its
name, and unitedly refused to pay its subscription. Then
this reincarnation of the National Ass mouldered and fell
away at the heel because the small farmer, who wants
more land, couldn’t pull with the big squatter, who wants
to keep what he’s got and add to it. Even the bogey of
“ socialism ” has hardly interested the small farmer in the
Union. He doesn’t employ much labor outside of his own
family. What has interested him is the sudden and
unanimous yell of the money-lender and big squatter for
the freehold. There is an instinctive desire on the part
of every farmer to call his selection his very own, and it
looked as if the farmers had found that union which
Is strength politically. But the advocates of the leasehold,
after giving the subject deep thought, suddenly expressed
their temporary conversion to the freehold system, with an
outbreak of demoniacal joy. “ Certainly, give the small
farmer the freehold—the ‘small farmer who is pay-
ing a huge and burdensome rent to the private
squatter landlord.” Then the squatter and the
money-lender drew back and looked like the
man who boiled a bad egg for breakfast. It is
one thing for the big landlord to rise and say that the
State’s tenant should get the freehold, but when he con-
verts the community so effectually that it decides nw
private tenant should have the freehold, then he gambols
about in a ridiculous fashion, and his yells can be heard at
quite a distance. As things are now the Farmers Urn® 11
amounts to no more than an ink-blot on the “ Yes side
of George Reid’s nose. Its collapse has been sudden ana
tremendous.
«,
An expert correspondent of Melbourne Herald
lately set forth a host of anomalies in Vic-
torian criminal law, showing the urgent neces-
sity for the codification thereof. For flying a kite
in the street a boy is liable to a £20 fine or six
months imprisonment, but the street larrikin who
behaves in a riotous manner (which may cover any-
thing short of mutilation, murder, or sudden death),
can only be handed £6 or a month. Obtaining
money by false representation in writing may bring
two years, but for obtaining money by false pre-
tences the accused must be committed and a J udge
may give him five years. A reputed thief, found
frequenting a public street, may be gaoled for two
years, but, if he actually steals anything under £2
value, the most he can get is three months. In a
simple case of petty larceny, if the accused prefers
to go before a jury, depositions must be taken and
the petty sessions justices must commit; con-
sidering the habits and customs of V ictoria s
honorariums this is a very desirable circumstance,
but those same justices, for other offences, may
fine up to £200 or sentence to three years with
hard labor and whipping, even though the accused
prefers to go before a higher court. And the
reason of these things no man knoweth.

“ A.H.B.” writes from Perth (W.A.): —
In my time have tried many varieties of toil, from
counter-jumping to bullock-punching, engine-cleaning
and cockying, and, almost necessarily, thought the
worker had many real grievances against the employer,
and that the latter were mostly inhuman brutes, who
treated their men (I speak of hard graft) more like dogs
than humans. Last few years I have had some oppor-
tunity of looking at it from the boss’s standpoint, and can
quite understand why the one-time sturdy socialist and
good fellow develops, with money, into the grasping,
“self-made man.” At heart I am still a toiler, and treat
men fairly and well. I find for my trouble that they
will take me down freely and well when opportunity
offers ; that they will engage under written contract and
break such contract upon the smallest inducement; that
they will buy tools, stores, etc., on tick from me with
which to start work and next day sell the lot to their
fellow-workers and clear with the proceeds; that to a
smaller extent they will even take down their mates,
and that they will' lie with blushless effrontery when
repudiating their obligations. To cap the lot, I shall
hear in the next township how Bill and Jim, on their
way through, were telling sensational yarns about the
amount for which they had taken me down, which amount
they usually multiply by three !
You will say “ prosecute,” and show them they cannot
do these things and go scathless ; but it would not stop
the practice. Also, I have neither the time nor inclination,
and the punishment would probably be so light that I
should only feel it to be an additional aggravation and in
no wise a compensation for the trouble entailed.
How can a man conscientiously work for an amelior-
ation of the condition of the workers when said workers
act in so contemptible a way? And how can a man who
continually suffers from such actions help acquiring the
habit of treating such men as beings who are below the
standard of humans ?
For Heaven’s sake answer me these questions from the
boundless stores of your experience, and thereby
straighten up at least one individual who is toppling from
the pedestal of democracy.
The Bulletin reckons this gentleman will just
have to go on toppling. When a man gets to an
angle of 45 degrees it is best to let him drop, and
buy a new man.
Much troubled in mind, the Cynic reclined,
His star was not in ascendant;
He deigned not to scoff for he had a bad cough,
And a tear from his nose was pendant.

specimen ” stuff has been stoped this year, and prior
to the sudden 10s. slump, market values had gradu-
ally declined £l, and just as gradually the reserve disap-
peared. Management reported to the various Stock
Exchanges that there was no reason for alarm, “ as far as
the mine looks ” also that “ the general quality of the
crushing stone is quite up to the average. Not quite
so much specimen stone is being obtained at pre-
sent, but from the appearance of faces in many
places/specimens’ may be obtained at any moment.
This is doubtless what the management has been
relying on since January to keep it out of the mess. But
the present reserves ran out before new finds were made
(they may not be made for a couple of years), and then
the. truth had to be told. Meantime, the gradual
shrinkage of values showed that somebody knew and was
quietly getting o.ut; but the first serious doubts seem
to have followed Bulletin remark (May 12) that the
specimen disease was afflicting the leading Gympie
mines. Buyers are now at 50s. ; four months ago brisk
business was done at 90s. It is hard enough at the best
of times to assess the value of most Queensland mines,
on account of wretched business methods above and
below ground ; but the “specimen” disease makes it,
for the outsider, impossible. While it lasts, and if the
insider is that sort of person, any villainy is possible.
During Phdp’s declining days the Queensland Govern-
ment, through the Mines Department, was anxious to pro-
tect the public against misleading prospectuses. A mis-
leading prospectus is not in the same street as a co.’s
gold return if the management wants to work the
market. Queensland Mines Department, which isn’t
administered badly, should look into this matter.
* * * *
Thanks to Charters Towers, Queensland is just
a bit more than keeping up to its last year’s gold figures.
Total for the month (for the whole State), 54,1060 z. ; last
year, 49,1570 z.—an increase of 49490 z. The Towers’ con-
tribution was 25,4820 z., or 57550 z. ahead of last year’s,
“till, it isn’t disguised, even by Towers’ enthusiasts, that
the field isn’t looking as it did 12 months ago, though they
pm their hojaes to the fine lot of prospecting and develop-
ment which is going forward.
* * * *
Chillagoe R. and M. debenture holders have
given board six months to look about, and won’t charge
interest in the meantime. If co. hits any ore it may gasp
along till Keats knows if he can get the Etheridge
scheme off. Anyhow, Chillagoe is another sick copper
show without a Sticht to guide it.
* * * *
Clarence, Bendigo, had a good half-year : 10,393
loads crushed for 52110 z., or an average of lOdwt. per ton.
Divs. declared represented Bs. per share. This, in view of
shaft-sinking and crosscutting at 980 ft., shows up well
Reserve, £4295. Saddle cut at 2280 ft. shows a little gold
in one leg. Should this stone turn out well and 980 ft.
dirt average up to trial lots, shares may have another jig.
Co. has paid £121,875 in divs., or over £4 a share.
* * * *
Float just through in Melbourne affects a slab of
alluvial ground lying dead between Duke and Main Leads
Consols and Burnt Creek claims, Maryborough (Vic.). As
they will pump it dry if lead runs as marked on pro-
spectus, inquisitive people ask how it was directors
turned up their noses at it, or why they let the holders
keep the ground unworked, for so long. Prospectus does
not show who has promoted the show. This ought to be
compulsory in all prospectuses.
* * * *
New Loch Fyne, Matlock (Vic.), cut the dyke
at 1760 ft., and shares were given a sickly sort of a lift. A
few brokers who bought low have been engineering
values upwards for a couple of months, but they are not
out yet. The main asset of the co. to-day is a £4OOO
reserve. Directors talked about ear-marking some of this
cash for erection of new plant, at a suitable site. Eesolve
is very wise, but it would be more prudent to see that
there is stone for crushing before spending money on new
stampers. Co. is one of the most economically and best
managed concerns in Australia ; and shareholders, bar
outside jobbing intrigues, will get a fair run for their
money. This is the good side of the show, and it is a lot
nowadays.

Gold production of Victoria for first quarter
of 1904 was 182,2250 z. ; divs. £148,915. This is getting on
towards £1 for each oz. won, which is not bad work.
Bendigo, however, paid £2 for each oz., and Ballarat 10s.
Bendigo mines yielded 48,3190 z., Ballarat 12,7790 z.

April outputs of principal W.A. mines -.—Fine
gold : Great Fingall, 13,0940 z. ; Oroya Brown Hill,
12,4450 z.; Perseverance, 11,7210 z. ; Ivanhoe, 11,0480 z. ;
Associated, 74670 z.; Sons of Gwalia, 52600 z. ; L.V. Con-
sols, 42150 z.; Cosmopolitan, 40220 z.; Associated Northern,
27920 z.; East Murchison Utd., ISOOoz. ; South Kal-
gurli, 13360 z. ; Golden Link, 9350 z. ; W.F. Main

Bullion : Golden Horseshoe, 17,016 oz.; Great Boulder,
13,2940 z. ; Mount Morgans, 42240 z. ; Westralia and East
Extension, 14370 z. ; Ida H., 1121 oz. ; Queensland Menzies,

Menzies Consols, 8240 z.; Champion, 718 oz. ; Greenmount,
5450 z. ; Cumberland Niagara, 3860 z. Most striking fea-
ture is the decline of 27000 z. in the Perseverance return,
and of 400 oz. in Boulder Main Reef. Latter is due to a
breakdown, and former to a decline in average from
1.350 z. to 1.090 z. This is the first month’s return under
8., M. and Co.’s supervision, and shows a decline in value
of about £12,000. The quarterly divs. of £87,500 must go
by the board on such a return.
* * * *
. Great Boulder (W. A. ) is being actively exploited
m all directions since Manager Hamilton returned. The
mam shaft is to be pushed down another 150 ft., to 1900 ft.
The new shaft on the north block is going down at the
rate of fully 100 ft. a month, but it is doubtful if this pro-
gress can be maintained in really hard ground. Present
depth, 500 ft. The additional treatment plant (Krupp’s
No. 5 mills) are being installed. These mills are proving
a success on Associated Northern.
* * * *
Prospects of North Kalgurli (W.A.) have bright-
ened considerably since prospecting was resumed. The
new lode at 500 ft. is opening up very well, and is being
stoped out 10ft. wide ; but test bores prove it to be at
least twice that width. The ore is going’ direct to the
mill. The North Kalgurli has been most disappointing in
the past through sheer mismanagment; For seven years
it was regarded as an absolute wild-cat, and although nine
levels were opened down to 1000 ft., nothing but broken
and isolated patches of ore were found. Co. was recon-
structed in 1901, and a new 10-head mill erected last
year, since when monthly profits of fully £lOOO have been
earned by neglecting all developments. Only recently
has exploration been resumed. Co. is now in 350,000
shares, so that, at ruling rates, mine is pretty highly
valued, and a good deal of the future appears to be dis-
counted. Working with a 10-head mill on such a highly
capitalised Bull-managed co. is the height of folly ;
and, as there is boiler and engine power for 20 head, the'
extra 10 stamps should be provided at once.
* * » *
North Boulder, Kalgoorlie, has crosscut through
a lode at 900 ft., but it is so low grade as to be practically
worthless.
* * * *
Merton’s Reward (W.A.), which was take - over
some time ago by Bewick, Moreing and Co., has closed
down, and some 150 men are out of work. At the annual
meeting, recently held, Kaufmann told most gaudy tales
of development; but the truth is that since Fred Merton
sold out, the concern has proved a complete frost. It is
said that Kaufmann has redeemed all the shares taken up
by Lord Rothschild, as the latter reckoned he had been
misled.
* * « *
Golden Link (W.A.) has sacked practically all
the men from the Eclipse lease, on which 200 were em-
ployed. The whole of the payable oxidised ore, not to
mention a lot of unpayable, has been depleted. Of course,
manager Haig tells directors, and incidentally share-
holders, that the co. must now depend on sulphide ore,
which he designates as payable ; but he has been working
on that ore for years without any returns, payable or the
reverse. Co. recently purchased adjoining Croesus mine
for £6OO. Croesus Prop, prospected down to 500 ft. with-
out any result, and it is extremely unlikely that anything
payable will now be found. Golden Link directors, in
addition to other financial follies, invested a lot of co.’s
funds in May’s patent gold-saving process, which was also
bought for the Flagstaff, Coolgardie. The plant on latter
mine proved a frost, and the one on the Eclipse was never
even tried.
* * * *
Westralia Waihi, Davyhurst (W.A.), floated,
some three years ago, in Adelaide, on reports furnished by
John Lonsdale, of the Golden Bar, Coolgardie, and David
Lindsay, is about to reconstruct. Co. is now alleged to
have a 22ft. reef worth 10 to 15dwt. per ton, but three
years ago an Bft. lode was stated to exist, which writer
couldn’t find even with a microscope. Only last November
four reefs were alleged to exist at 110 ft. aggregating 21ft.
and worth 20Jdwt., but nothing has been heard of them
since. After the fiascoes with Victory United, Ivanhoe
Junction, Island Eureka, and a few other Adelaide-bred
wild-cats, investors had better be pretty careful in accept-
ing the tales embodied in reports. Not long ago it was
seriously stated that the Golden Pole lode had taken a
kink and t- 'sted round into the Waihi; but the hard
nature of the country discredits such a yarn.
• * * *
During April, W.A. gold mines declared divs.
totting up £313,290, against £288,660 for same month last
year. Co.’s responsible areHorsehoe, £90,000; Great
Fingall, £87,500; Ivanhoe, £75,000; Cosmopolitan,
£20,000; Kalgurli, £15,000; Mt. Morgans, £15,000; Ida
H., £5400; Brown Hill Extended, £5000; and Golden
Eidge, £390.
* * * *
Very rich ore has been found at the Gsoft. level
of the Hainault (W.A.), in driving south. This find was
made 200 ft. south of the shaft, and well on to the South
Kalgurli boundary, on the Perseverance lode. This lode
has been practically untouched in the South Kalgurli, and
its development, from recent testing's (such as the bore to
1500 ft., which showed 4oz. ore for a width of 14ft., 90ft.
south of the Hainault boundary), speaks well for the South
Kalgurli’s as well as Hainault’s prospects. The addi-
tional 10-head mill for the Hainault has arrived, and
should be erected and going by July. Co. may then come
on the div. list. In the past this has been one ol the
worst-managed mines on the Golden Mile, and it says a
good deal for Manager Moss that he has succeeded in put-
ting it on its legs. Capital consists of 130,000 shares of
£1 each, of which 9000 are under option till December 31.
Some effort to boom them will certainly be made in the
near future to induce the option holders to ante-up for
the outstanding scrip. It is pretty safe to predict that
shares will be quoted at or over par before end of year.
• • * •
Boulder Deep Levels, Kalgoorlie, appear to
have got a very rich run of ore at the 900 ft. level. This
ore was struck some months ago from a western borehole
at a point 180 ft. from the main shaft of the Boulder
Bonanza lease. The joke of the thing is that, when the
co. reconstructed about a year ago, the particular part of
the property on which this rich find was made, was
excised and abandoned, and was only re-pegged on March
30, after the crosscut had confirmed the bore’s rich find.
This find is considered to be a continuation of Hannan’s
Star’s Morrison lode, and should tend to improve the
prospects of that co., as well as those of the Horseshoe
South (the old Boulder Half Mile South). Nearly two-
thirds of the shares of the Boulder Deep Levels are, or
were, held by Frank Gardner, and were or are pawned to
the Great Boulder Perseverance for the balance of an
advance amounting to £36,000. Under the circum-
stances shares can’t be recommended, as these pawned
shares will be, and are being, realized to liquidate the
loan. Official information as to the find is withheld,
but the lode is 7ft. wide, and worth 3 to 4oz. to the
ton. The Morrison lode is, however, very patchy, and a
poor zone may be come upon at any time, as has often hap-
pened before, both in the co.’s ground and in that of Han-
nan’s Star,
* * * *
The management of Victory United, Cudding-
wara (W.A.), has been discreetly silent of late since the
crushing returns failed to confirm the optimistic reports
of alleged finds. In December the manager reported ore
4ft. wide worth 3to lloz. In January it ranged from Bto
10oz., and, in February, it was more explicitly written
down to be worth 3oz. 12dwt. The crushing panned out
along way under an ounce. Co. is now making the usual
monthly calls, and, if shareholders had a grain of sense,
they wouldn’t pay a bean until the whole past manage-
ment had been inquired into thoroughly. Co. is one of
the numerous Adelaide-run wild-cats, which enjoy the
reputation “Yankee rails” held for years, as gambling
counters with no possibilities.

You all have seen, I have no doubt,
.How many people go about
With puffed-up eyes and noses red,
A heavy feeling in the head.
’Tis wondrous strange to me that these
Should not endeavor to appease
These ills, which they so oft endure,
By using “ Woods’ Great Peppermint Cure. !
“J.F.D.” writes in the interests of
humanity, if there is any left :
Went to Randwick a few weeks back to punt heavily On
a horse in the first race, but it didn’t come off ; so having
no more funds I started to walk home, and drifted un-
consciously into the Zoo. Now I wish to raise a howl on
behalf of the imprisoned. The white and grey opossum,
the suricate and a few other animals whom Nature in-
tended for night duty only, were shut out of their
hutches and confined in the open part of the cages, pre-
sumably for the benefit of visitors. Their efforts to roll
themselves into balls and bandage their tails tightly over
their eyes to shut out the dazzling sunlight were pitiful
to see. The door of the suricate’s hutch was torn with
claw-marks where the unfortunate little beast had been
vai ;ly trying to push it aside in order to get in out of the
glare. The polar bear lay on his back perspiring freely
and dreaming of ice floes and long irghts. The keeper
hit him on the nose with a junk of beef, and he gave a
mighty leap thinking he had been run down by an ice-
berg, but noticing the grinning faces of the Y.M.C.A.
c.’owd outside the bars he remembered his position, and
d ishing into the water made a determined attempt at
8 ticide. The Tasmanian devil —poor devil, he looks like
a blackfellow’s dog—had a lame leg and a lump of
skin and flesh missing from each hip, and was trying to
ascertain which side was the least painful to lie on. And
the poor old moth-eaten lions and tigers ! When the
keeper let down the feeding-bars, they knew they were
expected to rage violently around their cages, because
the crowd of gapers looked for it. The moment the piece
of ancient ’bus-horse was thrown in, the occupant of each
cage seized it and, rushing into his back-room, planted it,
and came out licking his jaws, trying to make the crowd
fancy he had murdered the head-keeper. One old make-
believe, who had to be fed on soft beef because his teeth
were bad, looked like Jawbone Neild. I watched the black
leopard stalking a shinbone, trying to imagine it was a
deer, and I wept. The monkeys are uncivilised Japanese,
and behave unseemly if a Christian Endeavorer comes
near their cages. After looking at the owls blinking in
the sunshine and praying for night or death, I rushed
the gate, and nearly collided with a dirty frayed-eared
elephant, who was humping round a whole’Sunday school
and a spectacled curate. The nilghai, the camel, and
a few other misshapen animals, doing solitary for life, were
poking fun at the elephant and calling him “blackleg.”
I wanted to knock down the gate and let them all out for
a run, but an animal who seemed to be in charge of the
unfortunates threw me into the road and I was nearly
run down by a cab containing a fat bookmaker, who was
coming home after the last race. If you meet a lot of
Etrange animals in George-street some morning you can
write me down as the cause. Re that lion that looks like
Jawbone Neild, you needn’t be afraid ; he has no teeth.
THAT TIRED FEELING.
When possessed with that tired feeling, feel

A Dangerous Poliey
THE most dangerous po'icy a man can pursue is to
neglect his Health and bring about his destruction.
Millions do this annually. A young man dies to-day.
Why? Imagine a man at 23, strong and healthy at 22,
dying of a decline of his physical powers. But so it is in
the world to-day. The way to the modern cemetery is paved
with negligence and misplaced intentions.
READER, WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU ?
You may feel ill, and not understand why you are so. Reflect. Was
your fat'ier a healthy man? No. What did he suffer from? Blood
Disease? You may inherit it to-morrow. What is that sore? It proves
corrupted blood. Your life, and that of others, is in danger. The Medical
Experts of
The FREEMAN & WALLACE
MEDICAL INSTITUTE
are the men to consult, for they have made a special study of all classes of
diseases arising from impure blood, congenital causes, or hereditary taint.
They cure to stay cured, and they cure rapidly, permanently and secretly.
BEAD THESE PROOFS:—
DEBILITY.
Mr. CHARLES P. CARMICHAEL,
of Station, near Brewarrina, who
had to give up work preparatory to
coming to a Sj'dney hospital, consulted
us, and in three months’ time wrote :
"Your methods of regenerating
weak men are wonderful. I am
surprised at my ability to work.
Thanks to you I am a cured man.”
BLOOD POIBON.
Mr. HENRY M. STONE, of Perth,
W.A., whose condition could not have
been more serious, after four months’
treatment writes:—
“1 am glad to say that I am
much improved in health, fly
friends thought I was a dead man.
You have saved my life.”
* our remarkable treatment will positively cure longstanding cases

forms of 1 aralysis, Anaemic and Nervous Headaches, Hysteria, Epilepsy, Nervousness,
or at. Vitus Dance, yield quickly to this treatment, endorsed by some of the
greatest scientists in England and Europe.
MEN—Young, Middle-aged and Old ! Are you Weak, Low-Spirited, Tired of Life ?

The Troubles of Men.
Upon the shoulders of man lies the brunt of the responsibilities of life. It is necessary for him to be
healthy, for Health is the Magic Key that opens the Golden Doorways to the Shining Walks of happiest Life.
The Sick Man s ways are Shrouded in Shadows, Darkened by Despair, and Melancholic with Misery and Kemorse,
Weary, degenerated men, walking the earth like shadows, pauperised in blood—these are the men upon whom
decay has set its inevitable blight. Degeneration of the vital essences of life necessary is present, and the
victim can count the weeks left to him. Any man in this condition, if not attended to by a Specialist courts
death. The Specialists of the Freeman and Wallace Institute are the People’s Specialists.
Good Health is the working capital of Humanity. Those who lose that are wrecked indeed. If you have
not the life and strength of an able-bodied, ambitious person, you should have yourself examined by these
eminent Specialists, who have cured so many thousands of what others have considered “ hopeless cases.” No
matter if Disease has you completely in its grasp; no matter if, through violation of the hygienic rules of
health, your System is Completely Shattered and Broken Down, write to these Experts, who offer you a System
of Treatment entirely Original and peculiar to themselves, which has been the means of saving thousands of
others ; and, if you will only take their treatment, they will surely' save y'ou.
• r L te ot l Ce ’ atK * not delay ’ for delay is the precipice upon which thousands stand to-day. Beneath
is the abyss of death. The Specialists may be consulted daily, FREE OF CHARGE, and private interview
may be arranged upon any important cases. The Physician-in-Chief, RICHARD WALLACE, M.D.,L.R.C.P.,E.
L.F.P.S., E., L.M., is registered by Australian, English and American Medical Boards, and bears the highest
credentials as a Medical Expert and Skilful Diagnostician. He is late of Hospital Staff, Melbourne, and
Imperial Army Medical Staff.


N.S.W. coal-owners put rather a mixed
case before the Railway Commissioners the other
day. They cursed the Socialistic legislation of the
Arbitration Act which compelled them to pay fair
wage rates, and then they asked that the State
railway freights on coal should be further reduced.
The coal-owners don’t object to the Socialism
which gives them cheap freight—only to the
Socialism which refuses them cheap labor.
Poor Philp seems to be a completely
busted politician now. Even the Brisbane
Courier rends him like this :
. The ex-Premier has proved himself as weak in the
irrelevancy and inconsistency of his negative criticism as
he has been demonstrated to be lacking in the qualities of
constructive statesmanship. The petty gibes in which he
indulges when speaking of his successors are hardly likely
to make electors forget the policy of drift which was
represented by himself and some of his “ tired ” colleagues,
who had exhausted alike their Ministerial usefulness and
the patience of the country, and whose retirement was
welcomed with a sense of profound relief by most sections
of the community.
It seems about up to somebody to say something
now concerning the Courier, wh :h humbly
supported the weak, useless and inconsistent
Philp during all those years when he carried the
basket with the loaves and fishes in it.
“ Curlew ” writes :
Was present at Vi 3. Minister of Mines M'Leod’s speech
at Bendigo on the 11th inst., when that excitable little
gentleman was responsible for the following statements,
delivered at the rate of 175 words a minute, or there-
abouts :
(1) Borrowing should be abolished.
(2) Taxation is unnecessary.
(3) Development of the “natural resources” of the
country will provide all cash necessary. (Questions dis-
allowed here.)
(4) Borrowing will be continued for “ reproductive
works.”
Government assistance of gold-mining will raise
Victoria’s “ credit in the London market.”
(6) Repeal of the labor clauses in the Mines Acts is
necessary to attract “ English capital.”
(7) Mining doesn’t pay for itself (and is apparently
a curse to the country, like a Freetrade Press).
(8) The burden of a graduated land-tax would fall on
the poorer classes.
(9) The Labor programme is a return to aboriginal
customs.
“ J.R.” gives an impression :
It was Premier Watson’s first trip from Melbourne to
Sydney. Previously he had travelled as an ordinary
member, now he was Premier, but there was no difference
in his circumstances or his demeanor.
There were no fat men with belltoppers to see him off ;
instead there were one or two men with hard-hitters, who
talked earnestly and puffed their pipes between times.
“ I see we have Watson on the train,” said a fat, well-
fed “ commercial” who, by a strange incongruity of cir-
cumstances, was travelling for ladies’ corsets.
“ Yes,” said an American confrere, “ and he can play
bridge darned well. I was just watching him playing
with young Kelly of Double Bay.”
“Think he’ll make a good Premier?”
“Raa-ther,” answered the ’Murkan ; “a man who can
play bridge well, and can hold his tong-ue, will make a
success, of anything 1 ”
At the various refreshment stopping-places the smiling
but inscrutable Watson would make a bee-line for the
telegraph-office, where, as a rule, messages were awaiting
him. Having attended to these, he would come back with
his papers tucked in his inside coat pocket. If time per-
mitted, he would secure a homely sandwich or scone. On
the Victorian side such items can be relied on.
When the sleeping car pulled up at Moss Yale in the
morning almost the first man to step ashore was Watson.
As usual, his destination was the telegraph office, and
while the other travellers were revelling midst bacon and
e B'§' s i grilled steaks and cutlets, the new Premier, spick
and span and fresh-looking, was engaged in the despatch
and receipt of telegrams. Prssent indications suggest
that Premier Watson will never suffer from swelled head,
and when he g-oes out of office it will not be as a result of
any indiscretion on his part. He is not given to super-
fluous talk ; he is methodical and quiet, and has a wide
knowledge of men and things.
Sydney Worker prints a letter from Car-
ruthera, dated July 28, 1891 —to a correspondent
who is unnamed, but there is no doubt about the
genuineness of the letter (the Worker reproduces
a photo of it): —
July 28th, 1891.
Dear Sir,
You may enrol my name as a member of the Single-Tax
League of Rockdale, and, as I seldom see you, my brother,
A. G. Carruthers, will give you the necessary fees.
I would also join the Labor League, but fear, if I do so,
my action will be misinterpreted. However, lam quite
in accord with the platform of the League in almost its
entirety, and when I am free to act independently as a
private member I shall publicly avow myself on your side
and in the membership of the League.
On the Single-Tax, I have been one of the oldest
adherents of Henry George’s views in this colony, and
have frequently publicly advocated them, as my reported
speeches will show.
If I can be of use to you in helping forward the move-
ment I shall be glad to do so.—Yours truly,
J. H. Carruthers.
“ Spring ” attends a meeting of Deformers:
& Sydney’s Gaud Mayor Lees has turned into a political
cuckoo. This bird always steals another’s nest. Lees had
a fair fighting- chance as a Deform candidate at Penrith,
but wanted to steal little Le vy’s nest up Potts Point way.
He found there was a snake in it. At a general meeting
for the local selection of a Deform candidate three entered
■ but only one was Chosen. The Lees and Stephen bar-
rackers were engulfed in a sea of noses and unredeemed
diamonds. It was the most unruly and best-dressed
political meeting I ever saw. If a Labor meeting behaved
thus the Tory press would have lectured with unctuous
horror for a week. A man who had taken a drop too
much meandered into the expensively-clothed gathering
thinking to have a quiet snooze in the arms of Respecta-
bility. He was awakened by a mighty, uncouth sound
like all Israel offering- to lay 30 to 1 Stiffun, and saw a
dense mass of Cohen howling at a red-faced Deformer.
The man on the platform spoke gently to the children of
Israel but finally subsided, muttering darkly about wha-
Cocky Carruthers would do to them all. Levy was after,
wards selected by a big majority over the Gaud Mayorf
And thus was the house of Lees destroyed in the camp ot
Dan by the Levites.
“Jack Shay” : Be “Brehon” (B. 28/4/’O4) :
“ Pensioners,” “ trades union officials in remote past ”
and “ blocking capable tyros ” are a few of “ Brehon’s ”
loose remarks. In “political dead-beat pensioners” he
finishes his break. Here is mine. Minister of Defence
Dawson, Premier Watson, External Minister Hughes,
Customs Fisher, Senators Givens and Higgs (Senate chair-
man), Reps. Spence, M‘Don aid and a host of others are all
old routine officials. M.L.A. Hollis, Don. M’Donnell
(N.S.W.), Prendergast (Vic.), Dunsford, Ryland and Kerr
(Q.), are also old union officials. Would recognition of
their service and ability lower anybody’s collective intelli-
gence ? As to capable tyros who were not union officials,
here are a few. Mahon (Federal Minister in three years),
Parson Ronald, Dr. Maloney, Wm. Culpin, King O’Malley,
Bamford and J. Page, all members of Parliament. This
doesn’t look as if Albert Hinchcliffe, of Queensland,
Thrower and Lamond, of Sydney, and other officials with
long service in routine union work were doing much
blocking by pushing their claims for consideration. Any-
how, people don’t rush out and give untried and unknown
strangers their cash and principles to mind, and it is only
natural that the tried men in office who have fostered the
political movement and helped its evolution from the old
trades unionism should be trusted to go farther and do
better ; and experience has proved the wisdom of the
course. For the tyro who is satisfied to become a Federal
Premier in 10 years, or a Minister in three, there isn’t a
better opening if he will only identify himself with the
movement for long enough to be proved—or found out.
When there are several aspirants for the
honor of being a Deform candidate in N.9.W.
they all go up before the Deform League and
exhibit their mental deformities, and the most
weird specimen wins.
The importers and the barrackers against
Australian industries are very fond of running
down Australian workmanship. The burden of
their song is—“ Australians can’t turn out work
equal to Britishers or other foreigners.’ On this
subject the opinion of Mr. J. M. Smail, Engineer-
in-Chief to Sydney Water and Sewerage Board, on
one class of industry, penned after a world tour,
is interesting:—
The system adopted in Great Britain for the supervision
of work did not appear to be as satisfactory as that ob-
taining in Sydney. A good all-round man was excep-
tional, and he doubted very much if one could be
obtained. The Sydney system of sanitary work generally
was equal to that in Great Britain, and the quality of
British workmanship was not superior to that turned out
in first-class jobs by Sydney plumbers.
Although Bully Bent is for ever bellowing
“Retrenchment” for every other branch of the
Vie. public service, he says nothing about a re-
duction in the cost of running the local seat of
Government; £BlOO is to be saved by getting rid
of 27 salaried legislators, but the other members
are going to cost just as much in working expenses
as was voted for the support of the larger body.
The “maintenance” bill of the State Legislature
amounts to £15,000 a year, exclusive of the sum
swallowed up by the printing office. The refresh-
ment room alone represents an annual loss of more
than £lOOO, owing, in a measure, to the large
nobbier of whisky which Bent and co. allot to
themselves for sixpence a time. How about re-
trenchment in the household exes, of the State
Parliament ?
“A.” : Be “A Quaker’s” protest against
compulsory military training (B. 28/4/’O4), it is
interesting to recall a story told by Benjamin
Franklin in regard to this matter. He says :
My being many years in the Assembly (of Pennsylvania),
a majority of which were constantly Quakers, gave me
frequent opportunity of seeing the embarrassment given
them by their principle against war whenever application
was made to them by order of the Crown to grant aids
for military purposes. They were unwilling to offend
Government on the one hand by a direct refusal, and
their friends the body of the Quakers on the other by a
compliance contrary to their principles, using a variety
of evasions to avoid complying, and modes of disguising
the compliance when it became unavoidable. The com-
mon mode at last was to grant money under the phrase
of its being “ for the King’s use,” and never to inquire
how it was applied. But if the demand was not directly
from the Crown that phrase was found not so proper, and
some other was to be invented. Thus when powder was
wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg),
and the Government of New England solicited a grant of
some from Pennsylvania, which was much urged on the
House by Governor Thomas, they would not grant money
to buy powder, because that was an ingredient of war,
but they voted an aid to New England of £3OOO, to be put
into the hands of the Governor and appropriated for the
purchase of “ bread, flour, wheat, or other grain." Some
of the Council advised the Governor not to accept that
provision as not being the thing he had depianded, but he
replied : “ I shall take the money, for I understand very
well their meaning ; ‘ other grain ’ is gunpowder ”;
which he accordingly bought, and they never objected to
it.

(A VOICE.)
[For The Bulletin.]
The terror of all slippery politicians is that irrepressible
political heckler known to all newspaper readers as
(A Voice).”
It’s really most annoying when I’m going very strong,
And I’ve got the crowd all laughing to a man
At a funny little story told to help the cause along.
And to give me time my sheaf of notes to scan,
When (A Voice) yells from the rear, thick and dank and
full of beer,
To ask me if my dog is black or tan.
It’s really very trying when I’m stating what I’ll do
With the Tariff to improve the toilers’ lot,
And I’m showing how the present fearful price of Bosher’s
Blue
Is the outcome of a subtle Popish plot,
When I hear a shout below, from (A Voice) who wants to
know,
Why I “ fell in ” with that cursed Braddon Blot.
It’s damnably annoying when I’ve proved beyond a doubt,
What the horrors of Protection really are—
How the duty raises prices when it shuts the soft-goods
out
Which our colored brother sends us from afar.
O, it makes me curse my task when (A Voice) gets up to
ask—
“ Have you read your friend M'Millan’s cir-cu-lar.”
It’s really aggravating when I’m fairly in my stride
With a rousing peroration to the free,
And I’ve knocked ’em by declaring that it’s always been
my pride
That the Labor Party never mastered me.
How it spoils the good effect for (A Voice) to interject—
“ But they made you take the duty off our tea !”
It’s very disconcerting if my chairman calls for hands
In my favor, and they make a goodly show,
When he asks for those against me—in reply to I his
demands, . .
Just to see those same paws rising in a row,
And (A Voice) I’ve heard before will inform me with a
roar—
“ That’s how Georgie-Porgie likes to vote, Yes-No !”

The Babe of Melancholy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I FOUND the Babe in the gloomy back yard
of one of those dens of dreadful despair
known in Woolloomooloo as lodging-houses.
It was about two years old; its curly hair was
brown, its eyes were blue, filled with an expression
of painful bewilderment. Owing to some mys-
terious affliction of the legs it could not walk, but
shuffled about in a sitting posture.
The first time I saw it, ’twas in the sink, catch-
ing in its palms the dirty water from the waste
pipe of an upstairs bathroom, and —drinking it.
I lifted it out, went to the kitchen, and pouring
somebody’s milk into a cup, handed it to the Babe,
who drank it eagerly, and promptly shuffled off to
play bowls with the cup and an empty salmon tin.
Then an idea seemed to strike it, and it shuffled
hack, sat up, and looked at me long and curiously
without ever the shadow of a smile. Then it
looked steadily at the ground, and seemed to
wrestle hard with some problem, and the puzzled
expression became intensified till it gave it up, and,
talcing one last look at me, crept off, crooning 'to
itself, towards a hole in the fence.
The families lodging in the house were those of
mechanics and artisans—people who sinned
grievously against Nature every day, but who did
so from want of perception and thought, and not
through evil nature.
After the men had left in the mornings the
women invariably went back to bed till about 11
o’clock. The Babe, of energetic nature, disliked
this practice and would protest so strongly that
the mother, to obtain quiet, used to put it out
into the backyard. The yard was paved with
conorete, which, as the Babe rolled about vainly
seeking some soft, warm spot, chilled its little
limbs to the bone.
When the mother at last got up and made a
light breakfast of about a pound of steak and other
trifles, she would go out and scold the Babe for
being such a dirty little devil.
After breakfast it was put into an iron tub full
of cold water and left to soak for an indefinite
period,' while its mother had a little chat and
steadied her poor, shattered nerves with small but
repeated doses of beer. When the household'
irritably expressed itself as “ full up of that kid’s
yelling, ” mama would lift her eyes to heaven and
humbly request Providence to inform her of what
crimes she had been guilty that she was tormented
like this. Then meekly gathering up the Babe’s
clothing, she would proceed to half dry and dress
the unfortunate infant. Having dressed it, she
would carefully pin the clothes up around its neck
so that they should not get dirty, and put it out
into the yard while she got its dad’s dinner ready.
Sometimes the Babe would sit for hours bolt
upright with its little fist stuck in one eye and the
other gloomy, wee optic fixed meditatively upon
the dull, grey concrete —still trying to solve that
problem.
When its dad’s late dinner was well under way
mama would rush into their room wildly toss
things about, and with clouds of dust and much
noise get it “ tidied up.” Then she would make
her toilet, with occasional frantic rushes into the
kitchen in petticoat 1 and corsets, her mouth full of
hair and pins, when a whiff of carbonised meat
and scorched potatoes drifted through the house
When dad came home, and the lights were lit,
and the dingy room did assume some little color
and cheerfulness, the Babe’s tea was rammed
down its throat, its clothes torn off, itself called a
little devil, roughly thrown into bed and threat-
ened with something terrible and indefinite if it
did not go to sleep immediately. _
Its father never romped with it. Nobody ever
took it out, in a pram or otherwise, into the parks
under the trees where the waving shadows fell, to
see the flowers, and trams, and children playing on
the grass ; to hear the myriad sounds that fill the
minds of children with vague subtle delight. Its
solitary pleasure, and the only time it ever smiled,
was when a dirty little kitten crept through a
hole in the backyard fence and played with it
amidst the dirt and smell of the sink.
All its days were sunless and miserable, and its
nights joyless and terrified, till one day the Babe
shuffled out into the sink, gave up the inscrutable
problem, stuck its little fist into its eye for the
last time, and—was melancholy no longer.

FOR
INDIGESTION.
When Griffith, now Chief Justice, heralded
his unholy alliance with M'Uwraith 14 years ago
by striking Glassey’s name from the Commission
of the Peace in Queensland, he would have been
astonished had someone prophesied the Labor
party in 1904—Fisher and Dawson Federal
Ministers, Higgs Chairman of Committees, Tur-
ley, Givens, and Stewart Senators, Page, Barn-
ford, M‘Donald and Culpin Reps., with Groom
and Wilkinson ready to vote Labor; Kidston
State Treasurer, and Airey Home Secretary.
Queensland has changed since the Q.N. Bank ran
its politics.
The late H. M. Stanley, exploring journalist
and showman, was in some respects the antithesis
of Livingstone, the self-sacrificing traveller to
whom he introduced himself in Darkest Africa.
David Livingstone had a happy way with him and
a keen sense of humor. Stanley, judging from
his public lectures and the stories told of him, was
a gloomy-fellow, greatly oppressed by a sense of
his own reputation. His platform style was as
heavy as the subject matter of his discourses.
Australia has never quite forgiven R. S. Smythe
(how rapidly R.S.S.’s ‘stars’ are dying off !) for
bringing Stanley to Australia. The white-haired,
bullet-headed celebrity talked mainly of latitudes
and longitudes in funereal tones, being evidently
persuaded that anything coming from him must
be full of interest for his suffering audience. He
was a bore ! What time he was a society lion in
London many tales were told of Stanley’s dreari-
ness as a dinner-table raconteur. He would dump
any amount of African native language into his
yarns. But on one occasion, when he had been
plodding for ten minutes through a seemingly
interminable anecdote, he was mercilessly extin-
guished. Said he—‘ Nanjijange, the youngest of
my black boys, came towards me crying ‘Pongo
wongo —jambaroo deki koo,’ or some such gibber-
ish. Edmund Yates, or Labouchere, called out
from the far end of the table —‘By Jove ! that’s
just what I expected of him.” There was a roar
of laughter, and Stanley indignantly discon-
tinued his sermon.
“ Hiphen ” on a Yic. military episode :
It was biting cold, with a thin, drenching rain. The
sentry stamped his feet and cursed the Easter manoeuvres,
the day he had joined the militia, and everything else.
Presently from where he stood on Nepean he saw a lamp
flash from the Queenscliff forts. He reported that the
other side were signalling, and word was passed along
for signaller O. to turn out and interpret the message.
After some difficulty he was discovered at the canteen,
somewhat mellow. Meanwhile, from the other side came
bewildering and frantic signals. Everyone thought that the
Russians at least were at hand, and the whole camp turned
out to hear the signaller read off the urgent message.
“ Dot dash ” came the lamp-flash from the other side,
and the half-tight signalman announced “A.” After that
came a wild and assorted series of dots and dashes. Sig-
naller O. seemed somewhat thunderstruck. “ XOVHG
(hic)L —” he stuttered. “ What the devil are you talking
about, sir ? ” roared the officer in charge. “ That’s the
message, shir —sheems to be something wrong —someone’s
pullin’ our (hie) leg.” A telephone message across to the
Queenscliff forts turned out half the garrison into the
wet, where for an hour they searched in vain for the prac-
tical joker. The 0.0. at Queenscliff then advised all at
Nepean to go to bed and sleep it off. After much bad
language had passed over the wires things settled down
somewhat and all was still. Half-an-hour later the
sentry reported more signal flashes from Queens-
cliff. The whole of the Nepean camp turned
out, and signaller 0., who was somewhat more
sober, reported himself unable to make head or tail of
the message from opposite. Blue with cold and red
with rage, the Nepean commandant rushed to the tele-
phone and talked like a soldier and a man for full five
minutes without taking breath or stopping to think of
new cuss words. Slowly, through the rain and pitch
blackness, light after light appeared on the opposite
headland, showing where the search parties were at
work. Presently a loud ring came at the headquarters
’phone. “You were right” came across the wires.
“ Aha ! ” muttered the Nepean C.O. “ We’ve found the
signaller. Three of him. There’s the light in one of the
guard tents, there’s the tent flap, and thirdly there’s this
dam, cold wind. He’s to be shot at daybreak. Anything
else we can do for you, kindly let us know. Good-night.”
Then the Nepean command kicked itself, and lynched
the inebriated signaller. After that one half the army
placed the other half under arrest and went to bed.

1VE ifc chillin ’ ! ”
I -m* “ Haven’t got one.”
“Give it baccy !”
“No baccy.”
“ What!—no got it chillin’ ! —no got it baccy ;
Baal mine think it you gentleman ; where steal
that (so-and-so) horse, eh ? ”
Therewith they marched —long strides, yam-
sticks striking the ground—black gins, full-
blooded, but also fully oivilised. And I had
spoken truth —no tobacco, no shilling, and any-
thing bigger too much wanted to be wasted.
It was down by Gulgolgon on the Bogan River.
There are some few bits of Australia at her best
out by Gulgolgon, in a good season: “Big Plains”
lifting at sundown showing the courses of old dead
creeks outlined in coolabah timber-trees like
umbrellas, and patches of water, spangles of silver,
gold, lead, as the sun declines and sets. Then the
sand ridge right across the western bar. One gets
to love those blown-up mounds (a last relic of the
big mountains which once were here) as the cave
man loved his caves. The pines make a serrated
crest sharp against the sky, and on all the slopes
are kooba and budda bush, and quandongs, and a
tangle of clematis and wild vines. Where they
touch the plain there is a thick green sward with
mile-long stretches of wild thyme like garden
candytuft, and myall whose life-essence, loosed by
a few axe-strokes, is as the breath of Parma
violets at their sweetest. The sun dips, and the
whole ridge is deepest indigo against a band of
sky the color of a ripe wheat-stalk. And it is
purple, like the purple which shows below the
wheat-ear. -Slowly, as a silver lamp quickening,
glows Hesper.
“ Good day to you ” ——
I knew him at a glance. Queensland black,
down with some drovers, been with the police in
his time.
“ I want five chillin’.”
“ Go and ask your boss for five shillings.”
“Look here; all country about here belonga
me, an’ I want five chillin’.”
He was about half-drunk and venomous as a
black snake.
“Clear out, will you,” said I, “and get along
to your camp.”
“ You not give me five chillin’ I’ll take stirrup
iron to you.”
He drew out his boot and began to tug at the
leather. I was minded to put the whip across his
horse’s rump and run him in like a bullock. But
the beggar carried a revolver and might play up
with it at the finish.
Suddenly there was an “Ah!” A boomerang
went whizzing through the air, circled about the
pair of us, within six feet of the myall’s ear, and
returning went down behind old King John.
The dingo looked up aghast. John stood
arrayed in his brass plate only, but carrying a
bundle of assorted weapons, and poising a spear
in his right hand. The myall stared, and whether
it was a doubt that John might get his spear in
before he could get his revolver out, or the hedge
of divinity actually visible about the kingship, I
know not, but after a long look, and without a
word, he who wanted five shillings crouched down
on his horse’s withers, dug in the spurs and bolted.
“Give it chillin’?” said King John, manda-
torily.
“ You shall have half-a-crown, old man.”
“ Gen’lman fellow you. I knew that. Plenny
station alonga Queensland, eh ? ”
We kept company for a spell, but the half-crown
was whip and spur to John, and he beat me by a
chain, with the bar for a finish.
I was walking round to the stable when up
sprang the two gins:
_ “ Kee ! Kee ! Kee! Walk about fellow. Think
him gen’lman. Baal, got it chillin’ ? Baal, got it
baccy? Stealum horse; stealum saddle. Ke-e-e!”
A mixed crowd, not too good, Set up a laugh,
and the situation was a bit awkward, when round
the corner appeared King John, mighty with rum.
He selected a weapon in haste, and the gins were
“kee-e-eing” in a shrill but minor strain.
King John returned, warm with his exercise:
“ Give it big fellow white money.”
“ Baal, John. Give it new shirt; red fellow ;
good.”
“New shirt, red fellow ; you come alonga me.”
He assented and took me to the store. The red
shirt would probably go over, the bar for more
liquor, but that was no concern of mine.
• * * *
A month later I was a bit north and east of that
district. My packer had gone lame and I wanted
to push along. Didn’t know of a station within
five and twenty miles, and couldn’t afford to leave
a good horse for the next man to find. A sound
of wheels in the timber, and a dray appeared ;
loading, a cask of beer and sundries; driver, a
fellow who looked as though he had seen better
days. On a second look one might have added
“and worse also.”
The stamp of “ inside ” was on him. I did not
figure out that second look till later on. He pulled -
up, as was natural, and sympathised, as was
proper. His effective remark was:
“ You’ll never make Brigalow, and Ben’s place
is only three miles down the creek. He’ll do a
swop with you for the packer, and you can hang
out there to-night.”
That fetched me. The packer could limp as
fast as the dray-horse walked, and we “pitched ”
as we went. He could talk, the man with the
beer-cask. He had travelled, and must have been
kicked out from amongst decent people.
Ben’s place was the pub, “The Swagman’s
Home,” and the devil of a home entirely. It
was three miles off the track, buried in the
timber, the only excuse for the location being
permanent water and a bit of good country round
about. Mauldry, in Maurice Hewlett’s sole book,
“The Forest Lovers,” would doubtless have ren-
dered the same reason for her choice of dwelling.
Ben was not as bad as Mauldry; he wanted “ the
stuff” only.
We sighted him first on the verandah, blinking—
a harmless-seeming cuss with a rabbit-jaw sort of
he id, weak eyes, and slavering lips. He showed
his hand a bit when we came to swop half-an-hour
later, and I had to part a fiver to get hold of a
naif-broken warrigal that tried to buck through
the hobble-straps when we turned him out.
“I’ll sell yer a green-hide crupper fer five bob,”
said Ben, my fiver in his pocket, and my horse in
his yard.
Then it was up to him to shout, and, next, tome,
and right away to the man who had brought in
the beer-cask also; and after that supper, which
was not much.
n s *®PP aside, supper over. The moon was
full, the night clear as day, but the outlook
ghastly. Rung timber, sun-bleached all out
towards the plain. A few red gums and black
belabs on the waterholes. Gaunt, bare, hungry,
wicked-looking, everything. And to make things
cheerier there came up from the stockyard the
low of a cow robbed of her calf, and from the
creek timber a mopoke’s hoot. The heritage of
desolation. I was. sick of it. It was a bad
patch of the sorrowful sphere; moreover, 1 had
been bested in a horse-deal and knew it. Was
there no consolation in the ineffable splendor of
the sky ?
“ Give it chillin’ ! ”
“ Hello, King John ; got ’em red shirt yet ?
“ Give it chillin’ ! ”
“No, one rum.”
“Not that one!”
He pointed to the bar as he spoke and shook his
old head, expressing a negative that was not to
be altered. It was the first time I had ever seen
a blackfellow struck that way, and it ought to
have set me thinking. But just then out came the
man of the dray :
“You black swine ! ”
He picked up a loose chunk of timber and
hurled it. King John dodged and escaped. I spun
a shilling after the log, and the old king, holding
it between his finger and thumb, pointed again to
the bar —“ Not that one ! ”
“He would neither have poisoned the air nor
burned the house,” said I to the man of the dray.
“ He’s the two ends and bight of a blamed
thief,” replied that honest fellow; “come in and
have a game of euchre.”
We played for drinks and we played for money,
but, by good luck and careful play, I kept up my
end. Perhaps they didn’t care about getting it
that way. The other was surer, and easier.
Twice before 10 o’clock the old king came pot-
tering around. He wanted to speak “’longa
gen’lman fellow give him big fellow white money.”
But they hunted him away, and on the final occa-
sion his last words were “ Not that one.”
A little before 11 I proposed to turn in, per-
emptorily and determinedly. None of their
hanky-panky tricks for me. I had camped in off-
side shanties before.
A hard and sad-faced woman looked at me, but
did not speak. The room was off the verandah,
an 8x 10 place, meagre and miserable enough. I
packed my “stuff” under the pillow, and lay down
without undressing, for a smoke, and dozed off to
sleep so, and woke with a start. “Not that one,”
seemed to sound from somewhere, and simul-
taneously there was a light tap at the door. I
pulled up and opened quick. Ben was there and
the man of the dray.
“ Not asleep yet ? ”
“ No ! ”
“ We were just looking round before turning-in,
saw your light burning, and thought you’d forgot
it. Put it out before you go off. This old place
would burn like a ragshop.”
It was the man who spoke. I saw some-
thing like blood behind Ben’s eye, and bar-
ricaded that door with all the flimsy furniture of
the room. Didn’t care about going to sleep either
then, but sleep masters bushmen once they get
inside a house, and, after a couple of pipes, I
began to doze and dream. In my dreams old
King John was smothering under a Danase shower
of sovereigns, and I was trying in vain to shovel
them off. The man I had met on the road and
his dray were coming headlong down the pinch
into the creek, and I below couldn’t stay them.
Thud —crash !
I was up with a jump. The furniture was all
over the floor, the door on top of it, and the man
of the dray sprawling over the lot. Ben stood
outside holding a lantern and a revolver ready.
I gripped a broken water jug and prepared to
lay the man out anyhow. But old Ben spoke :
“I can pull before you get in your blow, and
what’s the good? I want the ‘stuff,’ not you.
Turn it out and you can take your horses and a
pound for the road.”
“I’ll see you !”
Before the curse-word was out something went
past my ear like a wild duck’s wing.
The lantern dropped. It was darkness all
round, and from outside came the words, “Not
that one.”
There was King J ohn without the brass plate or
anything else in the way of apparel, but painted
up for high jinks in the old-fashioned style. He
stood out grandly in the moonlight. When I had
struck a match I beheld Ben pinned to the wall
with a nine-foot spear. It had caught him through
the muscle of the arm-pit. The clothes held more
than the flesh, but he was too scared to wrench
away.
Old John had spotted the game from the start
and had marked him down through the window
while in the very act.
He badly wanted to finish him, and also to split
the skull of the man of the dray. But I persuaded
him it was a good time to clear, which we did.
Left Ben tacked-up, and the man grovelling. Got
out saddles and packs, caught the horses, roused
up the camp and marched along—dogs, gins, and
all —towards Brigalow.
* * * *
When I told old Murphy the story he said :
“Ye made but wan mistake, bhoy.”
“ And what was that ? ”
“It was in hinderin’ of Ould John when he
would have made Ben into a porcupine.”
“ Ben is bad, then ? ”
“An’ you’ve the devil’s luck to be relating that
same.”
“ What’s the other man?”
“ Och ! nothing. Ye might use him for a dish-
clout if ye found him hangin’ on a fince. But
Ben ! I'm not forgivin’ ye aisy that ye came
between him and King John.”

“Falk” : Have hitherto held piously to
the English connection ; hard put to it over the
war, but waited for results; was clean knocked
out by three months in London while the Trans-
vaal labor question was discussed ; and shook off
the London mud with a wealth of political signifi-
cance. Time was when I thought Bull-Cohen a
myth ; found him real enough, and nothing to
oppose him but a mass of flabby sentiment. It’s
hard to say which is the worse—the Government,
with its angry conviction of the divine right of the
British peculator to undiminished dividends, or
the Opposition, with one eye on the political situa-
tion and the other on the domestic morals of some
totally irrelevant Asiatics. And you couldn’t
explain to the Englishman ; you shouted across
oceans of misunderstanding ; had to go back and
back looking for a common starting-point. I gave
it up and felt like the wrath of God in a medicine-
bottle. Fact is, as Meredith has been preaching
for half a century, there isn’t an idea in English
political life; only a formula or two, and some
sentiment, and Cohen. England is too big ; the
people with ideas are too specialised, too far re-
moved from political life. It takes an idea about
two hundred years to permeate ; and then it’s
dead. We gam by being better mixed, and have
the glimmerings of an idea, and some grasp of the
need for it; and it’s not well that the “ prodded
ox ” over yonder should be free to mess it about in
one of his plunges.
“ D.”: The R.C. “ soggarths” are making
a vigorous charge on behalf of the birth-rate, and,
if the christenings amongst their flock don’t
increase, it isn’t for want of effort on the reverend
father’s part. Stepped into a church, the other
evening, where a mission was happening, and
heard the father tell a male assemblage that if any
present, guilty of or cognisant of any acts for the
suppression of the undesirable infant, died that
moment, they were murderers, and the rest of the
congregation, by listening, could hear their souls
“ clash into hell.” There was an unfathomable
silence for a few minutes, but, despite the fact that
men were dying all over the planet, I couldn’t
hear a clash. I’ve been listening ever since, and
am convinced that my hearing is defective.
“ Burglar Bill ” : Be scope for missionaries
in the Australian bush. Met a p?isoner in a
country gaol who was serving a sentence for a
serious offence. He thought the gaoler was the
Governor of the State, had no knowledge of dates,
believed that his time would go quicker in winter
on account of the shortness of the days, and
couldn’t tell his own number. During his sen-
tence the visiting chaplain never once interviewed
him individually; and apart from finding out that
the gaoler wasn’t the Governor of the State (he
discovered that whe:i the Deputy-Comptroller
paid a visit), and the acquaintance formed with
his number, he left prison on the same mental
plane as when he entered it.

TORTURE.
No torture can be compared to the long drawn out suffering caused by continued illness. It would
be difficult, for instance, to imagine any torture which we would not sooner undergo than to suffer day
and night the excruciating pain of Rheumatism for 24 years, as experienced by Mrs. Elizabeth
Bosher, of 77 Henderson Road, Alexandria, N.S.W., and narrated by her in the following letter,
dated 14th February, 1903.
“Previous to leaving England, about 40 years ago, I was a great sufferer from Rheumatism,
which continued to trouble me for about 24 years after my arrival in Australia. I consulted several
doctors, but they all failed to do me any good. I also tried various advertised remedies with the
same unsatisfactory result, and despaired of ever getting lelief from the pain. At length I tried
Warner’s Safe Cure—for what reason I cannot tell you, because I did not expect to get any more
benefit from it than from the many other medicines I had taken. I was, however, very pleased to
notice a decided change for the better after a short course of Warner’s Safe Cure. The pains slowly
but surely left me, and at last I became quite free from them. This happened 16 years ago, and I can
honestly say that I have not suffered in the slightest degree from Rheumatism since that time, so that
I have to thank Warner’s Safe Cure for perfectly and permanently curing me. I may say that my
case is very well known in Alexandria, as I have for 40 years resided within half-a-mile of my present
address.”
There is, however, no necessity for anyone to suffer now, like Mrs. Bosher did. Rheumatism is
one of a family of disorders, caused by the retention in the system of urinary poisons owing to
defective action of the kidneys.
Rheumatism
Gout
Lumbago
Sciatica
Gravel and Stone
Bladder Troubles
are all of this family, and are most painful complaints, but each speedily yields to treatment by
Warner’s Safe Cure.
Am ther family of disorders comprises
Indigestion Sick Headache Jaundice
Biliousness Anaemia and Debility Neuralgia
vr tich are produced by the failure of the liver to rid tl e body of biliary poisons, and Warner' .s
S .fe Curb cures them all, simply because Warner’s Safe Cure restores to health and activity the
KIDNEYS AND THE LIVER.
The work apportioned by Nature to the kidneys and liver is that of dealing with, Converting,
extracting, and removing waste matter produced in the body by wear and tear of the tissues. It con-
sequently follows that when the kidneys and liver are perfectly performing their task, none of the
disorders mentioned can trouble us, as the causative poisons are absent.
It is nearly thirty years since scientific research directed specially to diseases of the kidneys and
liver was rewarded by the discovery of the medicine now known throughout the world as Warner’s
Safe Cure. At the outset of the investigation, it was realised that it was necessary to find a curative
agent which would act equally upon the kidneys and upon the liver, these two organs being so
intimately associated in removing the waste products of the body. Warner’s Safe Cure possesses the
desired property in its fullest degree. It acts beneficially alike upon the kidneys and liver, restoring
them to then- original activity, and enabling them to rid the body, by natural means, of all urinary
and biliary poisons. This is the reason why there is no necessity for anyone to suffer from
Rheumatism, Gout, Backache, Lumbago, Sciatica, Persistent Headache, Neuralgia,
Gravel, Stone, Bladder Troubles, Anaemia, Debility, Indigestion, or Torpid Liver,
provided Warner’s Safe Cure is taken as directed. Even Bright's Disease yields to treatment by
Warner’s Safe Cure.
A Simple Test to make as to the condition of the kidneys is to place some urine, passed the
first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and let it stand until the next morning. If it is then
cloudy, shows a brick-dust like sediment, if particles float about in it, or it is of an unnatural colour,
the kidneys are unhealthy, and no time must be lost in taking Warner’s Safe Cure, or Brigli s
Disease, Diabetes, or some less serious but more painful manifestation of their inactivity wi.l
result. [22


Lynette.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE wind still sighs thy name, Lynette ;
“ Lynette” across the blue lagoon
The troubled waters Whisper yet
Below the ghostly moon.
Would God that I might once forget
That golden noon—
The waters —and thine eyes, Lynette !
O golden noon of long ago,
The upland reapers bound the sheaves;
The gentle winds went to and fro
Among the lilies and the leaves;
A bird sang piercing-sweet below
The forest eaves,
A plaint of passion, love and woe.
His song was one with mine, Lynette.
“Lynette ! Lynette! ” it throbbed and shrilled,
An ecstasy of passion set
To rarer notes than ever thrilled
The heart with love’s sweet sorrow yet.
The song is stilled, , .
The bird is flown —and thou, Lynette ?
We parted in the dying day ;
The West a rose of fire became,
Where cloudy bastions, looming grey, ’
Burned awful lights of blood and flame ;
Like lurid torches O’er thy way,
And twilight came
To bar the gates on lingering Day.
But Dawn revealed a dreary strand 1 —
Grey marsh and sky and piping wind ;
Storm stooping o’er a wasted land ;
While pallid Day crept up behind
'The flats of ooze and salt and sand,
And brooded blind,
And chill and sunless on the land.
Our marriage-morn was in the sky,
The sun across the dreary plain,
Blinked once, a baleful, blood-red eye
And sank into the mists again.
And there, O God ! I saw thee lie
In drifting rain,
And moaning winds went hurrying by.
O ! what a bridal, Love, was this !
I held thee close and close, for sign
Death could not cheat us of our bliss,
I swear thy heart-beats answered mine,
Thy cold lips gave me kiss for kiss.
Was ever shrine
Or marriage-altar like to this ?
Oh ! Rose of Eden, mute and meek,
I made my marriage-vows alone ;
My tears upon thy pure, pale cheek, i
Thy cold hands clasped within my own ;
And answer, were there one to seek,
Thy lips had shown,
That smiled, and smiled, but would not speak.
And still thy spirit walks, Lynette,
A gracious ghost, below the moon.
A thousand seasons of regret,
A thousand years were all too soon,
To bid this lonely heart forget
That golden noon—•
The waters —and thine eyes, Lynette,

MAUD PEACCOOKE.
The Daughters of the Fog.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LONDON is a dreary Sahara of blackened
streets with occasional oases of pretty
women. In daylight the greatest of these
delightful spots is Regent-street, the
“Block” of London; after dark the vortex of
the whirlpool of beauty centres in Leicester
Square. London has many lovely women—
women beautiful. in face and form, and with
complexions which, when they are good, are
delicate as a piece of porcelain. But they have
a. tendency to dolliness, and lack the attractiveness
and charm of the Australian girl with her laugh-
ing eyes and swinging walk—larrikin swagger if
■you will, her easy confidence and self-reliance in
all her dealings with men. And beauty never
seems to come to the Englishwoman during her
early youth. From end to end of London you
cannot find the smart, pert, pretty, well-developed
youngsters of 15 to 20 that adorn every Australian
city. England sefems to withhold from woman her
inheritance of beauty until she attains the legal
majority of 21 years. The visiting Australian
is struck first with the utter absence of the
free-and-easy casualness of his sister of the
South, and the remarkable contrast between
the almost servile respect paid by Englishwomen
to men they know and their contemptuous disregard
of those they don’t. In Australia, a girl may be
as chaste as a whole college of vestals, but she
never omits to have a look at a passing man. In
the streets of London, beauty-actors might walk
from Bayswater to Bow, and the millions of pass-
ing women would never shift their gaze from the
distant fog. There are also in every Australian
city a proportion, frequently large, of cheerful,
larky damsels who, without the slightest thought
of wrong, consider a glance and a smile sufficient
introduction to any passable stranger. In Lon-
don, except in Whitechapel and similar localities,
the practice of “mashing ” is unknown. The only
woman who winks a roving eye is the lady with
the Past canvassing for custom. Even the frisky
shop girl—for the shop girl in London corresponds
in the moral scale with the barmaid of Australia—
needs a formal introduction to the gentlemen who
defray the cost of her charming wardrobe. Vir-
tue in London is a commodity, and were the
English a frank people, it would be quoted
among the stocks in the share circulars. There
is none of the Pagan promiscuity so frequently
met with in Australia. All is reckoned on a
cash basis, and the sordidness of the loves of
Londoners comes as a shock to the Australian,
who thought he was destitute of morals when he
left the Fremantle breakwater behind. Fairness
and frailty are so frequently associated that it has
come to be rather a reflection on a woman’s virtue
to be good-looking. Throughout the Old World,
it seems to be recognised by very many that, if a
girl possesses a certain standard of beauty, she
would be a fool not to adopt the profession that is
ready-made for her.
But the beauty of these women ! In Australia,
we look to the stage, to society, to the better type
of our working - girls, for our finest women.
Collins-street Block on a fine afternoon, the lawn
at Flemington, the suburban stations at 6 o’clock,
when the big shops and offices open their cages
and free the pretty birds who toil within —these
are the places where the Melbourne man looks for
the representatives of feminine loveliness. The
Lais of Lonsdale-street would be the last com-
petitor for the Australian beauty prize. But in
England things are different. The so-called pro-
fessional beauty of society or of the stage is
only a mediocrity in the race. If Paris of old
came to London, he might wheel a coster’s barrow
full of apples around Rotten Row and through
the choruses of the leading theatres without being
tempted to cast away the pick of his fruit. But
if he stepped into the promenades of the big
music-halls, he would be so spell-bound at the sight
before him that all the urchins in London might loot
his stock before he recovered himself. As to dis-
criminating, he would give the task up in despair.
Our fallen sisters of London are almost all lovely
in their youth. More beautiful French women
are to be found here than in Paris itself. Swiss
girls, German girls, Scandinavian girls, and Polish
girls are represented on every block. Even Aus-
tralia has sent some of its rouged daughters to
participate in the more lucrative industry of the
Fog. Did Don Juan feel that naught would
satisfy him but the smiles of a lass from far
Tierra del Fuego, he would probably find her
before he had turned-off three laps of Leicester-
square. In the promenades of the big music-
halls gather, night after night, from 50 to 100
girls, and fully 20 of these seem to the unsophis-
ticated stranger to have attained the utmost limit
of beauty that woman can possess. Every type of
womanly beauty is there. There is a Madonna of
Murillo drinking brandy and soda with a fat man
in a belltopper at one of the little tables fronting
the bar behind you. A Gibson girl is making
endeavors to catch your eye on the right. A
Stanlaws girl, dainty as if she had stepped from
a page of Puck, is just bidding you “Good
evening’’ on the left; and the Venus of Milo,
in all the glory of the Regent-street drapers,
stands like a queen at the head of the stairs in an
attitude of command. There are the regal, the
aristocratic, the domestic and the soubrette types;
all in the space of a few feet, and uniform only in
their loveliness. Their dressing is the dressing of
duchesses, with the exception only that they are
never dressed in bad taste. Vulgarity is unknown
to these sirens of the world’s centre. And if they
paint, which some of them do, it is done so artistic-
ally that nothing short of soap and water will dispel
the illusion. This is the quintessence of silken
sin and openwork wickedness. The Australian
man of the world, used to the tawdry finery and
vulgarity of the courtesans of his own land, stands
aghast at the sight of these women. In appear-
ance, bearing, manner and talk, there is nothing
about them to suggest what they are. Anybody,
ignorant of the ways of London, dumped suddenly
down amongst them, would imagine he had strayed
into an aristocratic reception. For these girls are
not recruited, as in Australia, from the ranks of
domestic servitude. Avery large number of them
are educated women —ladies they would be called
but for their profession. Among them are several
wives of military officers who fell in the late Boer
war. Leicester-square, with its appended music
halls, is part of the price that .England pays.for
empire. Another is a girl whose mathematical
career is recorded, on the books of a leading uni-
versity. She reigned as queen there in her year
of triumph. In the republic of Leicester-square
she is but a unit, and she has learned, what the
university failed to teach —that beauty is a more
profitable asset than brains.
Far worse than the aristocratic and high-toned
sin of modern Babylon is the shocking manner in
which the girl who has to work for her living is
forced to accept the attentions of men for whom
she probably cares nothing. A woman who would
succeed on the London stage, be she a Shak-
spearean heroine or a ballet girl, must be possessed
of almost absolute genius if she would obtain the
fruits of her ability and at the same time retain
her v-irtue. The typewriter and female clerk in
London are subjected to annoyances and'pressure
unknown in smaller communities, while the shop
girl is too frequently forced to use her beauty so as
to increase the profits of her employer. “ Haven’t
you got any gentlemen friends ! ” is not an uncom-
mon question for a highly-respectable draper to
ask an applicant when she complains that she
cannot dress like the girls around her on the
miserable wages offered ; while the casual manner
in which official people speak of husbands in high
positions conniving at marital infidelity leaves a
nasty taste in the mouth. , '
But there is a class of London girl whose sturdy
virtue and independence impels every decent man
to take off his hat. Scattered about the Strand
and Covent Garden Market are a score of coster
girls who pick up a few shillings a week selling
flowers. The beauty of some of these girls is such
that they might step straight into the promenades
of the big music-halls and command the highest
market. Yet they are content to spend their
youth worrying out a meagre living with their
“ bloke ”or their husband—for many of them sport
an ostentatious wedding-ring—with an occasional
wild drunk and a black eye and a fine that takes
half a week to make up, as their only relaxation
in life. These pretty, jolly, foul-mouthed, vir-
tuous little coster girls, living from day to day on
the very border line of starvation,, are the
daughters of the city, who illuminate its fog,with a
clearer and more attractive light than all the
dazzling loveliness of the Rahabs of Leicester
Square. .

Disease, which I had suffered from for sixteen
months prior to using Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills. Your reply was to persevere with the
medicine., I did so. I used fifty-three boxes
in seven months, when I left off using the
medicine thoroughly cured. My friends were
all joyfully surprised at the result, and I need
scarcely mention my own feelings about the
matter. My case has been
Looked Upon as Hopeless.
In fact, the doctors said it was the worst form
of Bright’s Disease they had ever seen, and
they told my friends that I would never re-
cover. They believed that it was caused by
an attack of Scarletina, which had troubled
me some time before. My friends asked the
clergyman to tell me that I could not live.
I was not at all surprised to hear the warning,
intuition having told me many and many a
time that I could not bear the burden much
longer, and I had Come to look upon death as
more .a means of deliverance than anything at
all to be dreaded.
“For sixteen months prior to using Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills it had been found
necessary to tap me every month. I was first
tapped in Geelong Hospital. The succeeding
month the accumulation of water was in-
credible, and each month was worse than the
last. I used to get an enormous size. Then
I went to a Ballarat Hospital, where two
doctors were in attendance each time the
water was taken from my system. By this
time I was very ill indeed, and had to be
tapped at home, where, on one occasion, they
Took Away 33 Pints of Water.
I could not stoop to lace my shoes, and I only
managed to go from room to room with the
utmost difficulty. The doctors did not pre-
tend to be able to do me any good ; they just
tapped me when it was impossible for me to
live with a greater quantity of water in my
body. You cannot wonder that I was wearied
of it all, and almost wished for the end that
seemed alone able to bring me rest. I had
been taking dozens of medicines since my
health became so bad; some the doctors had
prescribed, and I used many which friends of
mine recommended. When I was pretty well
at my worst, a friend, who had used Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, advised me to try this
medicine. Shortly afterwards, another friend
who had been cured by the Pills, gave me
similar advice, and after that I got further
advice to use the same medicine. In each
case my friends had taken the Backache Pills
with the best results, so it was a great encour-
agement for me to use them, though I felt that
I was past the power of any medicine to bene-
fit me in the slightest. From the time I started
with them the
Improvement Was Steady.
Four months after I took the first dose I did
not need to be tapped, and three months later
on I was quite cured. I’VE BEEN FREE
OF THE AILMENT TWELVE MONTHS
NOW, not one sign having returned. My
body and limbs are their natural size, and
there is no unnatural swelling.
“ I am happy to be able to write you this
letter, as it may benefit others who suffer as I
have suffered, if you wish it, I can get this
statement signed by clergymen, Js.P., and
other well-known people, as my case is known
far and wide. I cannot sufficiently express;
my gratitude to this medicine, and I trust that-
it will prove' as great a blessing to other suf* ;
ferers as it- has been to me. I will always be
glad to see anybody wishing to inquire into
my case ; of, if they write, answer any 'ques-
tions:” ' '
THIRD LETTER.
2i YEARS CUEED.
TIME IS THE TEST.
Streatham, Vic.,
29th April, 1904. '
Dear Sirs,—l have'much pleasure in
writing to tell you that I am in the best of
health, and have had no return of the
Dropsy or Bright’s Disease in any way. I
have had numerous' inquiries about the
Pills ; eighteen letters in all, I think. I
have replied to each letter, advising the
use of Doan’s Pills. It is now two and a
half years since Doan’s Pills cured me, and
I am confident that I am cured to stay
cured.
. . Yours truly, . . . - . ,

DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS


The Kind that Cures
A Family Medicine. A Household Remedy. A Splendid Tonic.
Used with Satisfactory Results, Always.
a a:
” Q
Mr. Frank P. Peacock, of Given
Terrace, Paddington, Queensland,
sends us his photograph, and
says:
“I have used Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla in my family for indigestion,
loss of appetite, and as a, tonic,
with very satisfactory results,
and have been pleased to recom-
mend it to my friends, who, in
many cases, have used it with
equal satisfaction. Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla is a household remedy
throughout Queensland, and is
the kind that cures.”
This is one of the best things
you can say about Ayer’s Sarsa-
saparilla: “It is a household
remedy.” Keep it on hand. Then,
just as soon as any member of
the family begins to complain,
he can take a few doses and be
quickly cured.
Of course nature intended that every one should feel strong and vigorous
all the time. We are usually to blame if we do not enjoy this good health.
We are overworked, worry too much, have too many cares, and perhaps the
warm climate debilitates us. What shall we do? Keep right on suffering
in this way? Or take medicine that will remove every impurity from the
blood, make the blood rich and red, and give vigor and tone to the nerves ?
Such a medicine is Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. A medicine that has been sold for
over sixty years. ,„ , , „
When you ask for Sarsaparilla be sure to use the word “Ayer s. There
is no other Sarsaparilla like it. Look out for imitations.
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
Just the Tonic for Warm Climates.
Ayer's Pills Sugar-Coated. A Gentle Laxative.
Prepared by DR. J. O. AYER 00.. Lowell, Mass., U. S. A.
The latest London music-hall sensation is “Datas,”a
“memory-man,” now appearing- at the Palace. He was
originally a gasworks stoker. He insists that he is not a
freak, hut works on a rational system of mnemonics,
founded on the association of ideas. The questions pro-
pounded to him are of the most incongruous description
—fit to puzzle a dictionary of dates. The Lord Chief
Justice of England once asked him : “ When was the
Utopia wrecked ; when were the Corn Laws repealed ; and
when did Mr. Lowe propose to put a tax on matches ?’*
The ex-stoker gave the correct answer every time.
Boerbohm Tree, holding forth to an interviewer on the
subject of his noble self and his noble profesh : —“Life
must be simple and natural for the man who seeks to
become a great actor, The imagination will not live in
an atmosphere of scent and sugar-plums and poodles.
No; the imagination is the greatest gift of the gods, and
it demands the rarefied atmosphere of the universal
world. The actor, like the author, must see men and
women with dispassionate eyes. He must have no little
bigotries of his own, no little barriers before his soul, no
little cramping predilections. He must preserve the
open bosom of the lake which reflects the grim mountain,
the wings of the swallow, the fleecy clouds of the heavens,
and the tremulous leaf on the swaying branch, with equal
sincerity. This, is why lam bold enough to claim acting
as an art: it is all imagination, all spiritual.” Tree was
doubtless seated with his right elbow resting on a table,
and his right forefinger pressed against his brow, when ha
got that lot off his chest. ,
The vainest men on the elocutionary racket are the raw
members of Parliament. A Sydney elocutionist, who has
put fully fifty through his hands, says their self-conceit
beats that of a chorus girl. They take their first lessons
bravely, but when honestly told that not much can be
made of them they sulk, pout, curse, and try to get away
without paying the fee.

H.P.” : The amenities of life in Australian country
towns. Our agricultural show was fixed for a certain
date six months ahead. The Town Hall on show night
is a valuable asset for a concert. Our Model Brass Band
got in early and secured the hall. Thereupon the
District Band Committee, which is also largely the Show
Committee, used its influence with itself and got the
show day altered, and immediately handed in an appli-
cation for the hall on the new date to the Borough
Council —again mostly itself. The “ Model ” people have
now a Town Hall on their hands on a date when the
whole population will probably be away at some other
Town Hall.
Apropos clown Tom Barry (B. 21/4/’O4). On his return
to London from Australia Tom took the King’s Head
Tavern, near Astley’s Theatre, where for years he had
been clowning. In this pub. financial embarrassments
overtook him. Barry had too much Bohemiamsm in him
to save money. He retired to private lodgings in Clap-
ham, where he died in 1857, His wife kept on the tavern,
battling with the creditors. On Barry’s death a public
meeting was held to devise means to assist his widow and
enable her to carry on the business.
“ H.” : After Barrie and Ainsworth, we may ask who
was the Admirable Crichton ? James Crichton, called the
Admirable, was a Scotchman, born 1560, died 1582. Thus
his unique achievements were crowded into a life of 22
years. At 15 he became M.A. of St. Andrew’s. In Paris,
he astounded the Sorbonne by proficiency in 12 languages.
Both in Prance and Italy he vanquished the most formid-
able competitors with disputations in theology, philosophy
and mathematics. He was Unrivalled as an amateur actor,
and also at the top in swordsmanship. He became tutor to
Gonzaga, heir of the Dukedom of Mantua, and ousted
him in the affections of his mistress. Therefore Gonzaga,
with two braves, all three masked, attacked him in the
street at night. Crichton beat them all off, but, discover-
ing Gonzaga, yielded his sword to him. The princely
ruffian promptly killed Crichton, who didn’t deserve a
much better fate. The crawl spirit which made him give
up his sword as soon as he found the other fellow was a
prince caused his death.
Walter Howe, well remembered here as one of Bland
Holt’s leading men, writes from London that he has just
completed the authorship of a play, in which he has
such confidence that he intends going into management
“on his own ” and producing it. His son, who has just
completed a tour of America with Forbes Robertson, will
act as business manager.
Said that Maud Chetwynd, the thistle-down dancer of
Williamson’s Opera Co., is going to marry again and leave
the stage, the tie that bound her to hubby No. 1 having
been quietly severed by the plucky little woman last
year. If this be her intention, the public will miss their
fragile friend. A pupil and pupil teacher at the Hyams’
Dancing School (Melbourne) before she joined the
“profesh,” Maud Chatwynd has the lightest feet in
Australia. Witness the nickname “ Fluffy ” conferred on
her by the co.
Pretty Miss Gladys Ure, who took her musical ambition
to America a while ago, writes from San Francisco :
“ There are fifteen or sixteen theatres, and we have been
to most of them. Some of the shows are too dreadful for
words, others a little better, but I have seen nothing to
oome up to our best Melbourne productions. I think I
have met nearly every manager in the city, and they don’t
half like being told that we have superior things way out
in Australia. . . . Melbourne wouldn’t stand some of the
dressing and inartistic scenery that they have here, and
yet all the houses appear to be rushed flight after night.
. . . I have a tempting offer. A New York manager and
the manager of one of the big theatres here are going to
produce a Children’s Opera on an elaborate scale. They
have asked me to undertake the whole of the training of
these children, which means a very pleasing salary and a
trip all round the States. I’ll not decide untir I have seen
the New York man next week.” If Gladys Ure seizes this
opportunity by the forelock and shakes it with all her
energy, she will make a distinctive name for herself in
American managerial circles. The damsel has a rare
talent for training yovyig voices, and before she went on
tour with Musgrove’s' Shakspearean Co. she got some
surprisingly good effects from a number of Melbourne
choir boys who were under her control,
“ P. J.O’D.” from Dublin : “ You will be pleased to hear
that Miss Marie Narelle is keeping up the honor of
Australia this side of the line, and has been engaged to
sing during the concert season at the great St. Louis
International Exhibition. ‘ Poverty Point ’ corres-
pondent (16/7/’O3) was right in stating that ‘our
charming Marie is a Ryan—Molly Ryan ’—but incorrect
in saying she ‘was born at Narellan (N.S.W.) —hence the
stage name.’ As a matter of fact, Narellan had nothing
to do with the auspicious event. ‘Narelle,’ the name of
the queen of an aboriginal tribe at Punk-kalla, near
Moruya, was assumed for stage purposes, by Marie, ‘ the
queen of Australian song-birds ’ (as she is called _in
Ireland). She was born at Combanning, a sheep station
near Temora (N.S.W.). Kindly insert correction.” [Tun
Bulletin inserts correction with pleasure, and trusts that
things are now on a sound basis. First trouble was the
correspondent who said that Sweet Marie was a Rooney—
and also an angel. Then came the correspondent who
said the angel was all right but not the Rooney—that she
was a Molly Ryan from Narellan. Now it seems that she
is a seraph from Temora. If there is any more trouble
Tub Bulletin will say the lady was born in Wilks’
electorate at Balmain, and if she likes to sue for damages
■he can.]
