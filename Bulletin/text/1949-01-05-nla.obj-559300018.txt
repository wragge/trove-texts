UP FROM THE VALE OF ROSES PEEPS THE SPIRE OF ST. DAVID’S
CjT. DAVID’S, a small village in Pembrokeshire, is of Roman origin, and
was called Minevia. It stands on a treeless, windswept plateau over-
looking the River Alan about a mile from the sea. Since the sixth century
it has been the seat of the bishopric and is the smallest “cathedral city” in
Britain. Both the Cathedral and the adjoining Bishop’s Palace are situated
in a deep hollow, formerly known as the Vale of Roses; only the top of the
Cathedral appears above the level of the plateau, from which the descent
is made by a flight of 39 steps.
The See of Minevia or St. David’s was traditionally founded in the
sixth century by St. David, the patron saint of Wales, upon its removal
from Caerleon-upon-Usk. The Cathedral and monastery founded by St.
David have vanished. William the Conqueror paid homage at the shrine
of St. David, but in 1088, during the first year of the reign of his son,
William Rufus, the town was sacked by Norsemen and the Cathedral was
burned. The present Cathedral, part of which may be seen on the right of
this view, is a comparatively small building, being 290 feet in length; it was
built mainly in the Transitional-Norman style of the twelfth and fourteenth
centuries. The interior, built of softly-tinted purple slate, is remarkably
beautiful with its lavish ornaments and richly-fretted nave roof, which forms
a striking contrast to the plainness of the exterior. Among the many points
of interest to be found in the interior are a late thirteenth-century Shrine
of St. David which formerly attracted many pilgrims; the Bishop’s Throne,
nearly 30 feet high, on each side of which is a seat for a chaplain, being
one of the few medieval examples of its kind still remaining in Britain;
and the Ambulatory contains a number of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century
recumbent effigies. Among the monuments is that of Edmund, Earl of
Richmond, father of Henry VII. In a walled-up recess near the High Altar
were found in 1920 a number of bones which are believed to be those of
St. David —embedded in the mortar and probably hidden there at the time
of the Reformation.
Near the Bishop’s Palace are the ruins of St. Nohita Chapel, which was,
according to tradition, the birthplace of St. David in 462, the son of a
Welsh prince and princess and uncle of King Arthur. His birth is said to
have been foretold 30 years before the event. St. David became the patron
saint of Wales and the head of the Welsh church; innumerable miracles were
associated with his name.

TASMANIAN MEMOIRS.
In That Yesterday Was Home (Aus-
tralasian Publishing Co.) Roy Bridges
describes an adventure his ancestors John
and Sally Woods had with the Tasmanian
bushranger Brady:
One of the gang brought in a side of
mutton and cut the chops. Sally fried
them and set the table. Brady and his men
ate their hot supper—or breakfast —with
her in attendance, while the captive colonists
waited under guard outside in the rain.
One of them had a bad cold and was
coughing so loudly that Brady threatened
politely to blow out his brains if he did
not stop. The meal was hurried by the
approach of dawn and the certainty of pur-
suit ; soon Brady and his men moved off
with their prisoners, led by John.
I do not know how far John led them,
though I judge toward the East Coast road
of today. John did not know —or remem-
ber—for, before freeing him and his fellow-
colonists, Brady saw that every man was
well and truly drunk with the rum from
Sorell-town. John staggered drunkenly
home to his distracted young wife late on
the Sunday; he defended himself against
her reproaches; he had only got drunk
at the pistol point—under fear of death.
To which, I assume that Sally used t the
favorite reservation of her old age: “Ah,
that indeed! ’’ But I fear that Great-
grandfather, being human, enjoyed that
morning out with Brady" and his bush-
rangers. No, I don’t fear ; I’m sure that
he did, like every man of his fellow-
colonists.
The passage illustrates the virtues and
defects of the author’s manner of telling
the story of his family and, indeed, the
scheme of the book itself: a mingling of
family history and personal reminiscence.
An encounter with bushrangers is
dramatic enough," and the detail —mutton
chops, setting the table, a man coughing
and being threatened with death for the
offence —gives realism and color. But the
conclusion, rounded as it is, trails off
into the author’s personal reminiscences
and conjectures. It is a dramatic situa-
tion in which the drama is not fully ex-
ploited.
Bridges writes pleasantly and ably
about what interests him —the history of
his family in the Sorell Valley, from the
time of John Nash, the father of Sally,'
who was one of the first settlers to be
transferred to the Derwent Settlement in
Collins’s time, down to the author’s own
boyhood. Contained in this is the story
of the family farm, which builds up,
throughout the book, into a warm and
living picture; one in which every stick
is known, and every stone has its own
history.
But the generations which built it —
the human links in the family inheritance
—are less finely articulated. The author
writes sympathetically about them but
they do not come to life; they are not
drawn in the round. And, too, there are
not many encounters with bushrangers.
Governors and dignitaries wander in
and out of the book, and sections of it
have the interest and value of original
documents. There is record of the “Black
War,” Land Acts and loyal gentlemen
toasting the birthday of King George IV
at Stodart’s Hotel in Hobart Town. And,
in the curious mixture of personal remi-
niscence with the theme of farm and
family, there is a brief —and interesting—
account of the author’s education, and
early experience of journalism, in Sydney
and Melbourne, with glimpses of political,
artistic and journalistic personalities:
Deakin, W. M. Hughes, Lionel Lindsay,
David Syipe, Keith Murdoch.
These few chapters of direct auto-
biography are the best in the book, and
they seem to bear no sort of natural
relationship to the rest. The author
could have made two books out
of That Yesterday Was Home: one,
a novel, based on the intimate knowledge
he has of one locality and family arid the
other a very interesting book of journ-
alistic reminiscences.

Horses and Politics .
Historically, the chief value in the
reminiscences of ex-Senator Alexander
John McLachlan, McLachlan : an F.A.Q.
Australian (Lothian Publishing Co.),_is
the account of his association with
Charles Cameron Kingston, one of the
South Australian stalwarts in the cam-
paign for Federation, and Minister for
Customs in the first Commonwealth
Ministry.
McLachlan was a sturdy Australian
Scot brought up in the hard way on his
father’s station in S.A.’s south-east, where
he remembers the shearers singing in
Gaelic. His accounts of his start in life
as a country solicitor and his chapter on
his racing and racehorse-breeding ven-
ture are entertaining reading.
He has a good (though elderly) story of
a Sydney bookmaker who made up a
party to attend a little country race-
meeting in New South Wales:
There was a race with only three horses
starting and the bookmakers closed up their
books and retired, as it was regarded as a
certainty. The Sydney man kept on bet-
ting, and as the odds were very cramped
was doing little or no business. Presently
a bewhiskered little chap arrived and asked
the price of one horse that appeared to
have no chance whatever. The bookmaker
named a good price under the circumstances,
and the countryman said he would take
500 to 50. Notwithstanding the position
he was laid this and asked if he would
like it again. He said “Yes,” and it was
accordingly booked to him. Judge the
amazement of the bookmaker when the
horse romped in a comfortable winner.
He had had a very expensive afternoon
and said to the backer he had had a good <
win. The little man said “Yes.” “You
are a lucky man to win that money,” and
the little man continued to say “Yes.”
The bookmaker, probing the matter still
further, said “You know, I own that horse
and did not give him a chance.” The
backer then rejoined, “Ah, yes, but I owned
the other two.”
At the age of 24, while earning
“an income beyond my wildest dreams”
as a solicitor on the Gladstone
circuit, McLachlan in 1897 accepted
a proposal from Kingston to join
him in Adelaide as partner. He soon
found he had to bear the main burden of
the work in the new office—Kingston was
then S.A. Attorney-General —and that he
had inherited the worry of straightening
out Kingston’s private finances. King-
ston had been one of a syndicate which
had made considerable sums in the
roaring days of Broken Hill and early
Coolgardie. Yet his financial commit-
ments resulting from bad management
of his investments, assistance of rela-
tions and sentimental purchase of family
trust lands were seriously embarrassing to
the office, though not, it seems, to King-
ston himself. When McLachlan tackled
him seriously on the need, for his own
sake, to give up politics and attend more
to his professional work Kingston finally
replied: “No, I can’t, Mac. The damn
thing is like dram-drinking. Once you
get into it you cannot let go.”
All unconsciously, McLachlan’s later
pages reveal that he himself became the
same sort of addict. His association with
Kingston obviously bent his own career
towards Federal politics, and after losing
two election fights in 1908 and 1910 for
the Adelaide seat in the House of Reps.,
and again for the Senate in 1922, Mc-
Lachlan got in on the Nationalist ticket
for the Senate in 1926. In August of the
same year he was invited to join the
Bruce Cabinet as Honorary Minister.
Thereafter ten years of Ministerial office,
mostly under Lyons, and divided by the
two years’ interval of Opposition during
the Scullin regime, took McLachlan to
the League of Nations, the Paris meeting
for the Kellogg Pact (which he signed
for Australia), and into earlier prepara-
tions to meet Hitler’s war.
McLachlan’s chief work in Federal
politics was his contribution to the pas-
sage of the National Insurance Act, still
on the statute-book, which the late Joe
Lyons was afraid to proclaim because of
“the burden on the country”—which
would make today’s Prime Minister
smile. Either the Chifley Government or
some successor will assuredly have to re-
turn to a principle of contributory
“social benefits” embodied in that mea-
sure. It was, declares McLachlan, really
differences with his chief over national in-
surance and compulsory military train-
ing and not the ostensible objection to
his being chairman of the Hume Pipe
Co. while P.M.G. in the Ministry which
led to his resignation from office. In
fact, McLachlan had inquired before
being sworn in as P.M.G. whether his
connection would be held to conflict with
his duties, and had received assurances to
the contrary.
McLachlan, perhaps from his Mount
Gambier associations as a youngster, was
a lifelong admirer of Adam Lindsay
Gordon, and would for hours on end re-
cite Gordon’s poems and “The Lady of
the Lake” (not the Leg of Mutton Lake,
of course) till Kingston, on an after-
noon’s walk in the Adelaide hills, would
beg him to stop.
Authors in "Who's Who ."
Ten years ago an article appeared on
this page concerning authors included in
the 1938 Who’s Who in Australia, edited
by J. A. Alexander. Alexander mustered
a mixed bunch of 135 authors. The 1947
edition of the same work, edited by A. H.
Chisholm, gives brief biographies of more
fhan 200, as varied as those paraded by
Alexander.
Many authors have died since the 1938
edition: among them “Banjo” Paterson,
Randolph Bedford, Dr. C. H. Souter, C.
J. Dennis, Wm. Baylebridge, John Shaw
Neilson, Louis Esson, Wm. Gosse Hay,
Helen Simpson, Henry Handel Richard-
son, G. B. Lancaster and Fumley
Maurice.
Arthur Bayldon, overlooked in 1938, is
the oldest living poet listed in the 1947
volume. Born 83 years ago in Yorkshire,
Bayldon was “lighter-owner, tea-merchant,
canvasser and fancy backstroke swim-
mer,” and “printed for subscribers several
books of verse.” As was once said: “An
unautographed Bayldon is a rarity —a
book to treasure.”
Dame Mary Gilmore—who ran the
women’s page in the “Worker” for 23
years —is three months behind her one-
time editor, H. E. Boote. The leading
woman in Lane’s “New Australia*’
movement, Dame Mary went to Paraguay
in 1895, and remained there for five
years. Who’s Who says that she “claims
rediscovery of lost secret iof propagat-
ing mate, Paraguayan tea; known by
Australian aborigines as ‘The Dark
People’s Friend.’ ”
Others over 80 are Gilbert Murray,
the only living Australian possessing the
Order of Merit, who lives in retirement
at Oxford (England); poet Bernard
O’Dowd; and Louis Lavater, who edited
The Sonnet in Australasia (1927).
The 70-and-over group is large. Four
of them—Will H. Ogilvie, Frank Fox
(first editor of “The Lone Hand”), Albert
Dorrington and F. J. Dwyer —live
abroad. Dwyer’s address is Boulevard
d’Alsace, Pau (Basses-Pyrenees), France.
Ogilvie, still contributing to The Bul-
letin, is at Selkirk, Kirklea, Scotland.
Others over 70 are Roderic Quinn (now
living at Waverley, N.S.W.), E. J. Brady,
Mrs. /Eneas Gunn —who now remembers
her as Jeannie Taylor?—Ethel Turner,
mystery-writer Arthur Gask, Dora Wil-
cox, J. H. M. Abbott, J. W. Gordon
(“Jim Grahame”), Walter Murdoch,
Nathan Spielvogel (A Gumsucker on
Tramp), C. H. Bertie —he still lectures
on old Sydney—Will Lawson and Hugh
McCrae, who “was articled to an archi-
tect but soon abandoned the rule and
compass in favor of humorous drawings
and serious verse.”
Among writers between 60 and 70 are
Leslie Allen, who still writes verse occa-
sionally ; Katharine Susannah Prichard,
who was born at Levuka, Fiji; Archer
Russell, author of Gone Nomad; and
Monsignor Patrick Joseph Hartigan
(“John O’Brien”), who wrote Around the
Boree Log and was parish priest at Nar-
randera (N.S.W.) for many years.
In the same group are to be found
husband and wife Vance and Nettie
Palmer —Vance’s The World of Men was
published in 1915 and Nettie’s The South
Wind in 1914; Roy Bridges, who has
written 35 novels, and his sister Hilda
Bridges, Who has a dozen to her credit.
Stella Miles Franklin was only 18
when My Brilliant Career was published,
while H. G. Lamond, .who was once a
professional horsebreaker, had to wait
until he was 47 before Horns and Hooves
saw daylight. WB. Plowman ( The Man
from Oodnadatta ) was a Presbyterian
missionary, and Jack McLaren, of the
same faith —his father was a minister —
beachcombed at Cape York and on a
South Sea island. He now lives in Lon-
don.
C. E. W. Bean, who edited the Official
History of Australia in the War of
1914-18, was called to the Bar (Inner
Temple); called also to the Bar (Lin-
coln’s Inn) was F. M. Cutlack, now a
regular Bulletin writer, who wrote the
eighth volume (on the Australian Flying
Corps) of the Official History. Bernard
Cronin went in for cattle-raising and
farming and poet J. Griffith Fairfax sat
in the House of Commons. Poet F. T.
Macartney was a N.T. public servant,
and Brian Vrepont (Benjamin Truebridge)
was a violin teacher, medical masseur,
“roamed Australia on horse, bicycle and
foot,” and spends his spare time in axe-
work.
The over-50 and under-60 class includes
Frank Clune—his hobby is “trying any-
thing once” —who has turned out
15 breezy books since 1938. lon
Idriess’s list of new titles since
then also runs into double figures, but
unlike Clune his wanderings appear to
be over. The Frank Dalby Davison
entry is out of date —no mention is made
of his Woman at the Mill or Dusty, and
he now lives in Melbourne.
William Hatfield (he changed his name
by deed-poll from Ernest Chapman) was
articled to a solicitor in England, but
came to Australia and took up bush work.
He knew Kudramitchie Jim of Inna-
mincka, friend of Burke and Wills, and
Silver, survivor of the Suliman Creek
massacre. W. E. Harney ( Taboo and
North of 23), “drover, cattleman and
trader,” is now a patrol officer in the
Northern Territory. The Bulletin’s
“Brian James” is in under his pen-name,
and admits to having been born near
Mudgee (N.S.W.). He did not begin
writing fiction until he was 50.
Alan Villiers has had the most colorful
career of all in the under-50 group. :
Villiers has been sailing in windjammers
since 1918, except for a long break during
World War 11, and in 1934 bought the
Danish training ship Georg Stage, re-
named her Joseph Conrad, and sailed
60,000 miles around the world. Another
restless author is Michael Terry ( Across
Unknown Australia and Sand and Sun),
who came to Australia the year "Villiers
left these parts as a boy of 15 in the
barque Rothesay Bay. Terry is a land-
lubber who likes getting around in cater-
pillar-track trucks, but he is always pre-
pared to accept a lift from a camel.
Sarah Campion (Mo Burdekin and The
Pommy Cow) was once a cook and “suc-
cessively canteen superintendent, com-
mercial traveller, secretary, librarian,
laundress and dressmaker.” Her occupa-
tion in 1946 Was “storming Australia
House for passage home.” Xavier
Herbert took up “pearl-diving, sailoring,
bacteriology, anthropology, stock-riding,”
and was Supt. of Aborigines, Darwin.
Herbert’s recreation is “prospecting for
gold,” which is as far-seeing as any leisure-
time pursuit listed in Who’s Who,
although there is a lot to be said for
Edgar Holt’s terse preferences, “cooking,
eating,” or for “breeding Australian
parrots,” one of the hobbies of Aus-
tralian-born poet Ernest G. Moll, Pro-
fessor of English at the University of
Oregon, U.S.A.
Jack Lindsay’s recreation is “work.”
He has written or translated over 50
books, while his brother Philip Lindsay,
who has published 25 books, likes “watch-
ing cricket.”
The under-40 group is made up for
the most part of war-correspondents, ex-
servicemen, poets and short-story writers.
Flexmore Hudson, lan Mudie, Rex In-
gamells, Rosemary Dobson (the youngest
poet in the volume), W. Hart * Smith,
Mary Lang, Michael Thwaites, Shawn
O’Leary, John Quinn, Dal Stivens, Mar-
garet Trist and Kylie Tennant are among
those who gain an entry. Some authors
not included are Godfrey Blunden, Eric
Lowe, Kenneth Mackenzie, Patrick
White and Ernest Wells.

BRISBANE
102? FOUNDATION OF HAIG
Lieut. John Oxley and his party anchored in Moreton Bay
and later, on December 2nd, 1823, entered the Brisbane River.
Convinced that a town should be established on its
banks, his recommendation led to a penal settlement
late in 1824. The first camps at Redcliffe Point,
proving unsuitable, were moved to the present site
of Brisbane, a choice that has been applauded by
later generations.

Some particulars about the dog
known as the Great Dane?
The Great Dane is an ancient breed
of fighting dog that originated in
Europe as a much heavier dog than
the present breed. During the last
300 years it has become lighter, being
bred for speed in hunting boar. In-
troduced into England in the nine-
teenth century, a Great Dane club
was founded there, in 1882. The
breed later became fairly popular in
England and the U.S.A. Show stand-
ards are: Height, minimum of 30in.;
weight, minimum of 1201 b.; colors,
brindles—tiger striped with black and
fawn shades, preferably showing
darker muzzles; black; all shades
of fawn and blue; coat, short, dense
and sleek; head should have medium
stop; ears medium and pendant;
body heavy and muscular yet grace-
ful; tail carried low.

(2) The best material to use? (3)
How to get rid of worms which throw
up earth mounds and spoil the
appearance ?
(1) January or early February.
Work the top-dressing well into the
roots and then water heavily. (2)
Loam, with a little sand and finely
sieved, is preferable at this time of
the year. The addition of sulphate
of ammonia will improve the color
of the grass. (3) Worms responsible
for the casts can be destroyed by
applying lime-water made from
slaking 41b. of stone-lime and then
adding 20 gallons of water. Apply it
with a watering-can on the affected
patches late in the afternoon.

(1) Is agapanthus evergreen ? When
to plant it ? (2) What are the names
of the plants and the color ,of
blooms?
(1) Agapanthus (South African lily)
has evergreen foliage, and the bulbs
can be planted at any time of the
year. (2) The flowers are carried on
long stems during December and
January. Umbellatus albiflorus
(white), Umbellatus flora plena (dark
blue) and Welleighni (blue) are cata-
logued by seedsmen and plant mer-
chants.

Method of fishing for snapper and
black, bream and best baits to use?
In N. S. Wales snapper are usually
caught by means of a line, baited with
any kind of fish. Mackerel, yellowtail,
mullet, shark, squid and starfish are
mostly used. The snapper is a large
fish requiring careful playing and
some skill to land successfully. Black
bream can be caught by net or hand-
line. Hauling ana meshing nets are
employed. In the case of fine-fishing
the best bait is the slipper j>rawn,
though the common prawn is suitable.
Mackerel or oysters are sometimes
used with success.

Remedy for Indian wax-scale on
shrubs?
Make a mixture of 21b. washing-
soda, 2oz. caustic-soda and dissolve
in four gallons of hot water. Stir
thoroughly and apply while warm
with a strong jet-spray or a brush.
One treatment in January and another
in late February will clean the pest
up.
* * * *
A few hints as to points that
should be observed when making
purchases for a stamp-collection ?
(1) Refuse any but perfect copies,
free from cuts, tears, stains, finger-
marks, etc. (2) Unused stamps should
preferably have the original gum on
the back. (3) In the case of used
stamps select lightly postmarked
copies. (4) See that perforation teeth
are intact, and that the margins of
alleged imperforated stamps are suf-
ficiently wide to make it certain that
they are not perforated stamps cut
down. (5) The print of a stamp
should be well centred and the color
well preserved; the paper should not
be rubbed or thinned down at the
back.

Origin and source of ambergris?
How much do pieces generally weigh
when found?'
It is occasionally found in the in-
testine of the spermaceti whale. If
ejected soon after it forms, it is soft
and black; if it remains and accu-
mulates it causes death. The carcass
is gradually broken up, eaten by fish,
etc., and the compact brown or grey
material, which is much harder than
the black variety, floats to the surface
of the ocean and may be washed
ashore. It is this variety which has
been found in pieces weighing up to
2001 b. In the majority of cases, how-
ever, the pieces vary from a fraction
of an ounce to a few pounds.
* * * *
Can a blind person become a com-
petent musician?
Yes, though the handicap is great.
John Stanley, bom blind, was at 11
organist of an important church in
England, and at 21 was occupying a
similar position at the Temple Church
in London. Subsequently he qualified
for a doctorate in music. Two other
very important organists and com-
posers, Wolstenholme and Hollins,
were blind, and one of the great
pianists of the world, Marie von
Paradis, was similarly afflicted.
# * * *
How can I identify the spotted
diamond-bird, and what are its habits ?
It is small, active and colored
black and buff, patched with red and
yellow, and with little white spots.
Its loud monotonous call, resembling
“Sleep, baby,” is heard throughout
southern Australia. It lives on insects.
Tunnelling into a bank, it builds a
domed nest of grass or bark strips;
there four or five white eggs are laid.
* * * *
Is there any record of the Maoris
finding an aboriginal race when they
landed in New Zealand?
Yes, the Morioris, whom the Maoris
exterminated or drove out. A last
remnant took refuge in the Chatham
Islands. There are many interesting
relics in the Canterbury and Dominion
museums.

What is a supercargo ?
A term in maritime law (adapted
from the Spanish “sobrecargo,”
meaning “one over or in charge of
cargo”) for a person employed on
board a vessel by the owners of the
cargo to manage their trade, sell the
merchandise at the ports to which
the vessel is sailing, and buy and
receive goods for the shipment home-
wards. He has control of the cargo
unless expressly or impliedly limited
by his contract or agreement.

Whom did Captain Cook marry,
and anything about his descendants?
On December 21, 1762, he married
a Miss Batts, of Barking in Essex.
By her he had six children; three
died in infancy, the others before the
end of the century. James, the eldest,
became a naval officer and was
drowned in 1794; Nathaniel, the
second, born in 1780, also joined the
Navy and went down with H.M.S.
Thunderer at the age of 16; Hugh,
the youngest, died in 1793, when only
17. Mrs. Cook, to whom George 111
granted a pension, lived to be 93,
and died at Clapham on May 13,
1835.

What is the meaning of “Bottled
in bond under Commonwealth
Customs supervision’’ ?
Spirits are imported in casks and
placed in bond, pending payment of
duty. The spirits are then emptied
into vats and reduced in strength.
The contents of the vats are then
placed in bottles. The whole operation
is carried out under the supervision
of a Customs officer.

SAN CRISTOVAL
BY J.H.M. ABBOTT
WHEN you voyage be-
tween the New
Hebrides and the Solo-
mons the first of the
latter you corne to is the big
island of San Cristoval, and, as
you glide over the bluest of sun-
lit seas along its south-western
coast, the massive grandeur of
the towering mountain ranges in
the interior, the wild primeval
aspect of the dense forests
stretching downwards to the sea-
shore, and the seeming emptiness
and solitude brooding over its
rugged outline are strikingly im-
pressive.
As it looks to us today, so
must it have looked to Men-
dana and his seamen over three
and a half centuries ago.
Cape and promontory open
out as we pass by ; bay and har-
bor unfold their gorgeous
panorama of tropical scenery;
curving beaches and jutting
reefs, headlands and little islets,
pass in review before us. Over
all seem to rest the silence and
mystery of many ages, the vague
secrets of unrecorded centuries.
Seldom do we see the little grass-
built villages among the palms
above the beach. Only now and
again does a curl of faint, blue
smoke, show i n g wraithlike
against the deep shadows of the
mountain, indicate that living
men and women people these
dark, still forests. It is only an
odd fisherman in his canoe
whom we perceive occasionally
paddling gently over the placid
waters of some wide bay.
Beautiful and grand as a view
of it from the sea is, there is
something harsh and forbidding
in the very aspect of San Cristo-
val, some tacit warning to the
passing voyager that here is an
inhospitable land, a place of
danger and disaster and the
chance of sudden death.
And so it was, and maybe is
still. San Cristoval *4O years
ago had the reputation of being
one of the savagest and most un-
civilised islands in all the South
Seas. About that time, when
the writer made its acquaintance,
it was the only large island in
the Solomons upon which a mis-
sionary of some sort or another
had not established himself, and
there were no traders there,
either. What trade came from
it was collected by the traders,
in coasting along its inhospitable
shores, directly from the natives
themselves. The island had a
reputation for cannibalism and
headhunting, and “man belong
bush” or dweller in the interior
was said to be the wildest and
most intractable human being in
existence. Possibly, having heard
so much of evil concerning it,
one found something sinister in
its aspect from mere prejudice
and fancy—but somehow it did
really seem grimly forbidding,
even on the finest, brightest and
loveliest of tropic mornings.
Guadalcanal, with the mighty
Lion Mountain towering up
almost to a height of 10,000 feet,
and Malaita, dimly blue in the
distance upon the starboard bow,
seemed almost cheerful and civi-
lised after sombre San Cristoval.
As a matter of fact, the “man
belong bush” in both these
islands is probably as disagree-
able a customer as his fellow in
San Cristoval, but the “salt-
water,” or coast, natives have
come more into touch with white
men than have those of the
latter, and the nearer aspect of
the islands themselves, from
some reason not easily explain-
able, is less forbidding.
At Aola, on the north-east
coast of Guadalcanal, there used
to be a delightfully-situated little
trading station that was typical
of the Solomons. When the
writer saw it it was occupied by
a genial trader who was known
to natives as “Billo”—his name
being William. Aola gets its
name from the Aola River, and
an adjacent native village, but
“Billo’s” house and store were
built on a tiny coral inlet not
far from the mainland beach.
With his schooner at anchor
before it, his white residence
store gleaming through the stems
of tall coconut palms, his copra
and ivory-nut sheds nestling be-
low a huge spreading tree at the
landing-place, a beach of dazz-
lingly white coral sand girdling
the islet, the blue sea shining in
the sunlight across its low, flat
levels, “Billo’s” little kingdom of
about eight or nine acres was
such a delightful fairyland as to
make you fervently envy him its
possession. And when you went
ashore on to “Billo’s” hospitable
verandah and “Billo” sang out
to one of his “boys,” “You
go catchem ten feller young-
feller coconut,” and you
drank the thirst-quenching milk
of a green nut, you felt even stfll
more envious of “Billo” and his
kingdom.
That was many years ago. In
and about these islands,
especially Guadalcanal, history
has been written in the blood of
brown men and white men since.


A DAY IN TOWN
BY GLORIA
RAWLINSON
WASPS! Henry Teke’s meditations
were full of them. It seemed to
to him that they were buzzing in
angry clusters about his mother
as if determined to hold the garrison
where he had sheltered for eighteen
years; where he had been guided (but
more often driven), and where, as Little
Henry, he had been stuffed with slices
of wisdom and old-fashioned precepts.
His mother refused to acknowledge the
difference between Henry the child and
Henry the man.
A week ago, just as he had thought of
trying out the ingenious oral composi-
tion which was his defence, his rake had
struck a wasps’ nest—now, angry and
mortified, he remembered his childish
burst of tears when they had stung his
legs. He could still hear his mother say-
ing “There! There!” as she dabbed the
lumps with her bluebag, which brought
no relief, since there was no blue in it.
Perhaps Mumma had forgotten, he re-
flected as he watched the curious work-
ings of her face when he uttered the
words “town” and “land money.” Her.
life was a long round of regrets for things
she forgot. “Henry. Oh dear, I forgot
to put up the sliprails and the cows are
out.” “Henry, I forgot to feed the
chooks.” “Henry, no dinner. I forgot
to put it on.”
BUT if Mrs. Teke’s memory failed her
in household matters, she never for-
got Henry’s shortcomings. Of course
he was her darling boy, the pride and
joy of her widowed heart, far above his
many cousins and that Sid Timete in in-
tellect and behavior —but he needed firm
handling, and she had big strong hands
and a masterful mind. Nelly, her other
child, was quiet and manageable, except
for standing at the fence and rolling her
eyes at that Sid Timete, a pastime which
Mrs. Teke intended to nip in the bud
when she had finished with this new non-
sense of Henry’s.
“You can argue until the crack of
doom,” she said, smoothing down her
sack apron. “It is useless, Henry, use-
less. Go alone to town indeed! You!
Not if I know it! You used to go with
Papa, and what good were you? You
never stopped him spending my land
money.”
“But, listen, Mumma, listen,” pleaded
Henry. He spoke in a certain soft loose
way with a singing intonation which
threw his sentences into a kind of
rhythm. “Listen, Mumma. I’m grown-
up now. I was only fourteen when I
went to town with Papa. I’m a man
now. I smoke and... Well, I do. And we
need the cash. Sometimes things go
wrong in the post-office, in a rural de-
livery, anyway. Mr. lorgensen told me
he once lost a letter with a lot of money
in it. And, anyway, Mumma, we should
have things, everyone in Manuka Point
has things except us. I haven’t been to
town since Papa died.”
< ( \y OUR Papa was as shiftless a Maori
I as ever lived, though he was easy-
going, I must say, and gave me the
enamel bath for my birthday just before
he died. But he paid for it with my land
money, and no plug, remember. I had to
make one out of an old tyre until the
country supplies came, and then it didn’t
fit too well until I tied the whey-bag over
it.”
“But, Mumma, my share is a sixth. I
want my share.”
“This time I’ll get the farm in pie-
apple order and buy more fencing-wire,
and paint, and chickens.”
“But, Mumma, listen. Papa told me
it is all settled by Land Court many years
ago. When lam sixteen my share is to
be one-sixth, and here I am eighteen and
I want my rights.”
“Your grandfather made the legal
business, and, to be sure, his male heirs
get a sixth on their sixteenth birthday,
and thereafter as written in his will, and,
to be sure, you are his only male heir.
But you are a minor, Henry, and that
means that you cannot do anything with-
out your mother saying yes or no, and I
say no —you are not going to town.”
“But, Mumma, it isn’t fair, after all the
hard work I do and the way I dug in
vow muddy garden yesterday and all, it
isn’t fair. Nag, nag, nag, that’s all you
do, that’s all the thanks I ever get. Nag,
nag, nag, I’ve a good mind to throw my-
self over the Horse’s Neck —then you’d
be sorry. I want to buy a second-hand
jeep with my share.”
“Yes, Henry, I know. Look at the
car you and Papa bought! All its inside
gone, no tyres, no hood. A good nesting-
place for the hens. No, Henry, my land
money comes once only every third year,
and this time I am handling it. You are
too young and too thriftless, like Papa.”
< < I AM the man of this house! ” Henry
1 tried to thunder at his mother, but
there was a deplorable quiver in his
voice. He drew a deep breath and said
with some dignity, “I’m old enough to
milk, aren’t I? Old enough to dig in
your old garden. Igo your silly mes-
sages, don’t I? I’ll go to the dogs, that’s
what I’ll do. I’m sick of your nag, nag,
nag. If I got bottles of whisky, now, and
drank it on the blackmarket like some
men I know”
“Oh, Henry, you are not a man yet.
Not by a long chalk! A man doesn’t
cry when he’s stung by wasps. I once
gave you money to buy milk-cans and
what happened? You brought back a
watch, didn’t you? A watch that broke
its spring two days later, so I had to sell
it to the old-gold man, and he said nine
carrots are only worth a shilling. Now,
that’s enough, Henry, you have all of ;
Papa’s bad points, and would only get
into the hands of swindlers.”
So she had not forgotten the wasps!
“I must keep my temper whatever she
says,” Henry told hiniself, and immedi-
ately the devil took hold of his tongue
and he let loose a long tirade of abuse.
He burst into gesticulations, frowns,
stamping feet, waving arms.
“No, no,” murmured his mother, and
went on murmuring right through his
harangue. “I know thieves would rifle
your pockets, and remember Papa,
though goodness knows I don’t want to
say anything against the dead, but Papa
lived like a lord on my land money.”
“You jealous fat old weka!”
“All Maori troubles seem to be about
land moneys, and I was a patient wife
and mother, never getting very mad at
him, except the time I pushed him into
the pig-trough for being drunk on Sun-
day”—
“Tied to your etfrty old sack-apron
strings! Look at the mess you made try-
ing to build a fowl-run. Forgot to make
an opening for them to get to the nests!
Forgot this, forgot that! Everyone in
Manuka Point knows how you treat me.”
“Every three years it comes, and never
a bit ahead do I get, and now that Papa
has passed through the little white
gate”
“Papa went out through your broken
old sliprails. We never had a decent gate.
And a stinking burnt mess for break-
fast. What sort of kai is that for a man,
I’d like to know! ”
“I forgot I had them on, Henry, if you
mean the sausages. But, as I was say-
ing, the way the world goes is something
you are too young to understand”
“Sending me to church on Sundays to
listen to old Paikaraihe preach—and,
anyway, when I bought the watch it was
because we never know the time. Three
clocks and every one different and none
of them right. Mumma, listen, all the
young men in Manuka Point laugh at
the way you boss me.” He almost
foundered in tears —a pitiful spectacle for
any enemy.
She would never have given in but for
Nelly, who had sat quite still listening to
the argument—a quiet, plain-faced little
girl three years, younger than Henry. At
last she could bear it no longer. She
went and stood in front of her mother
and clasped her hands beseechingly.
“Mumma, listen, if I was to go with
poor Henry I would faithfully see that
he got the cheque money into cash and
put it in your depositing bank or bring
it home safe in good order, and I would
take care of Henry, and if he bought a
jeep I would truly look all over and under
it and see that the man did not cheat
him so that the land money of his would
be spent wisely and well.”
K/f RS. TEKE was staggered. Her flow
* v * of words completely dried up—even
the wasps deserted the garrison. Nelly,
her darling daughter, who had inherited
all of her own good points and some of
Papa’s charm. Nelly, siding with Henry!
She made a feeble protest with both
hands, twisting her apron. “No! No!
Well, that is, I don’t know”
Henry knew she had faltered. He
closed his eyes for a few seconds and
issued an unspoken order. “Make her
let me go, God, go on. You can if You
want to.”
She gave in, but slowly, and with the
air of a dog made to disgorge a bone.
“A girl your age, protecting a great
boy like Henry! Dear, dear, what non-
sense ! Still, we do need the cash for the
farm’s sake, and I was thinking of a
gathering, just our own kinsmen —not
that Sid Timete or his people—a crayfish
or two, the small brown pig, a sack of
flour, perhaps. Still, the farm will swal-
low up most of it, but, then again, you
could wear my hat, Nelly.”
HENRY did not quite believe it until
the morning that his mother opened
her old tin trunk and brought out her
greatest treasure —he gave her an un-
expected hug when he saw the mush-
. room hat. „
“Now, listen, children. Nelly, take care
of this hat. It is an inheritance. I wore
it when Papa and I were married, and
your grandmother wore it on her wed-
ding day. Please the Lord, I’ll live to
see you wear it at your wedding, but
keep away from that Sid Timete, Nelly,
I know his mother —a fickle, peevish
woman who went as a schoolteacher
and met her husband away from these
parts, and very faddy about the house,
but she’d want you to do all the work.
Henry, if you are so foolish as to buy a
jeep with your sixth don’t dare to show
your face in my house unless it has a
certificate of fitness. Nelly, don’t leave
Henry’s side, not for a minute, and don’t
speak to strangers. Papa always said
there are pakehas with tongues oiled like
sardine-tins. Nelly, remember the hat
and the certificate of fitness.”
“Yes, Mumma, I will, but what is it,
this certificate?”
“Ah, you see, I should never let you
go—you are both too young and inno-
cent. It is a receipt from the Govern-
ment to say that you are now not
"responsible for killing anyone because
your brakes are in good order.”
THEY had been less than half an hour
on the train when Henry went to
smoke on the platform, leaving Nelly
alone in the carriage, and when he re-
turned he brought with him the nicest
man she had ever met.
“So this is your sister. How do you
do, Miss Nelly? Good Lord, what has
she got on her head?”
“It’s Mumma’s mushroom hat,” ex-
plained the simple Henry. “Mumma was
married in it. Nelly, I speak to Mr.
Racer about the troubles with Mumma
and her nagging me about not being able
to take care of myself. And, just think,
his uncle is head boss in the bank where
we go to get the land money cashed. And,
Nelly, he knows about a jeep, a good
jeep that is for sale in a garage he knows
about.”
Shfe smiled shyly at Mr. Racer. He
was such an honest-looking man. He
would take care of them. Yes. Miss
Nelly must have new things, a dress —
certainly a hat Nelly gasped and looked
at her brother. Henry nodded care-
lessly. “Yes, this hat of Mumma’s is
very old-fashipned, I will buy you new
things out of my sixth. Mr. Racer knows
the best fish-shop, too. The one Papa
and me used to eat at was no class.”
A LMOST as soon as she was off the
Tv the train Nelly went into a peculiar
trance. She had never seen so many silk
stockings or so much lipstick and powder.
She had not dreamed that so many men
existed or that all girls looked so much
alike. The golden-haired, red-headed
and dark-haired pakeha girls—how pretty
they were, tall and slim, with lovely red
smiling lips. There were Maori girls,
too, with red fingernails and high-
heeled shoes, and Nelly thought, envi-
ously, that they were even prettier than
the pakehas.
“I ought to put Mumma’s money into
her depositing account right away,”
Henry said feebly as they came from the
bank with a roll of notes in Henry’s
breast pocket.
Mr. Racer shook his head. “Plenty of
time, Henry. Plenty of time. Here is
your sister head over heels in love with
the Golden Girl model, aren’t you, Miss
Nelly?”
“It’s a lovely dress. Henry, do you
think, perhaps, can I have this dress and
hat?”
“Sure,” answered Mr. Racer. “Sure!
Henry isn’t a mean brother. That green
rigout' will look nice on you, and the
hat in the corner is the real style to go
with it. Come along.”
WHEN they left the shop half an
hour later Mumma’s mushroom hat
was in a paper-bag and a cardboard box
contained Nelly’s old dress and shoes.
Nelly caught a glimpse of herself in a
shop mirror and for a moment won-
dered who she was. The real Nelly Teke
was partly in the hat-bag and partly in
the box that Henry carried so jauntily
under his arm. The band of her new
skirt was too tight for comfort, and the
shining shoes crushed her toes, but other-
wise there was no real contact between
the new clothes and the old Nelly Teke
of Manuka Point.
Then Mr. Racer took them to see the
second-hand jeep, and Henry gravely con-
sidered it. But his eyes kept straying to
a big green car that stood a few yards
away.
“Ah!” said Mr. Racer. “I get what
you are thinking, Henry. What would
the folk back home think of that big
car, eh? Almost new, none of your
cheap down-on-its-tyres here. Still, times
being what they are, a youngster like
you must be content with the not-so-hot,
eh? I daresay you couldn’t even handle
a big car like this.”
“I can drive any car, any sort, big or
little,” Henry said coldly, and added
“After all, I’m not a kid.”
“Yes, Henry, I daresay you could
drive her, I was only fooling. The point
is that you only have a sixth—you
mustn’t use Mumma’s money, you know.
Mumma wouldn’t like it,” and he shook
a finger playfully under Henry’s nose.
“Oh, well, I might think about it some-
time. Where do we get our lunch?”
“You are my guests, you know. This
poor little girl is nearly fainting. No
fish and chips for you today. Come with
me, right along to my hotel. Leave your
things here.” And he actually opened
the door of the big car and thrust the
hat-bag and box inside. Nelly, parting
thus heartlessly from her other self,
opened her mouth to protest, but Mr.
Racer hurried her away.
HENRY lagged moodily behind. Even
when eating his big plate of chicken
his mind seemed to be far away. But
Nelly was happy except for the tight
skirt-band and the hat that somehow
would not stay on her head. She had
two helpings of ice-cream and two tiny
glasses of something that at first tasted
just like very cold water and smelled of
penny-royal.
“Now to business.” Mr. Racer pushed
his glass of beer to one side. “About this
old jeep, Henry. You know, even an old
jeep is money these days, I own it isn’t
as good a car as I’d like to see you driv-
ing, but you’ll get a lot of hard work
out of it, I hope.”
Nelly woke up. “Has it got the cer-
tificate of fitness?” And Mr. Racer
assured her that it had.
Henry’s cold eyes were fixed on Mr.
Racer. “Ah, yes! The jeep, the chean
jeep. The second-hand, third-hand,
fourth-hand jeep, which I’d like to know.
Well, it’s a pretty poor show. How
much did you say the big green car
cost?”
“No, Henry, you are only a boy, re-
member. It would take all Mumma’s
money and most of your sixth, and you
know she would never allow that. In
any case, I am not sure that it is for sale.

OLD
HEINRICH and the LAMBING EWE
BY E.O. SCHLUNKE
I~\OUNG OTTO
\ / WEISMANN
y was riding over
the farm, feel-
ing for the first time
since his father’s
death some months
ago that it really be-
longed to him. He
had a good horse
under him and two \
sheepdogs following,
which caught up to him at each gate,
generally dripping from some dam or
waterhole they had come across, or
panting extravagantly and giving him
deceitfully pathetic glances because he
was making the going so hard.
At each gate Otto thought to himself:
Now I can shut this or leave it open,
just as I please. I can put the wethers
into the Big Grass or the Reefton wheat
stubble. I can leave the ewes in the Clay
Hill stubble or put them on the oats.
And then he was letting his horse have
its head across the stubble paddock, while
he felt the cool autumn air against his
face and round his neck where it blew
into his open shirt. He watched under-
foot trying to see how the trefoil, ball-
clover and self-sown wheat were lasting,
feeling the softness of the soil under the
horse’s hoofs as an assurance that they
would keep on growing for some weeks
without further rain.
He cantered over the gentle, rolling rise
where the self-mulching red clay made
the horse labor so that the dogs gained on
him and made a hopeful burst as if they
expected to catch him. But they fell
quickly behind again when down the
other side he galloped hard, shouting and
waving his arms because a flock of about
twenty crows had gathered round a pros-
trate ewe.
THE crows, which had kept so
cautiously out of range yesterday when
he had a gun, stayed insolently beside the
sheep, walking round it with their long,
sharp black beaks stabbing the air with
each step. One even flew on to the
sheep’s head to make a last attempt to
maim it by pecking at its eye before Otto,
shouting louder and swearing, arrived
among them.
It flew away after the rest and settled
in a near-by pine-tree to watch: still in-
solent, as if it was confident that it was
only a matter of time and it would have
the ewe. First its eye and tongue: then
a hole in the chest to get at heart and
lungs: helping other crows to strip off the
wool and skin bit by bit, squabbling and
fighting and feasting so heavily each day
that it would hardly be able to fly home.
Otto dismounted and dropped the reins
close to him on the ground, remembering
that he’d have to keep half an eye on the
horse or walk home. The sheep, which
had lain so helplessly flat on its side while
the crows were round it that Otto had
feared it was dead, now began to throw
itself about violently, beating its head on
the ground after each futile attempt to
rise so that it bled from the crow-pecks
round its eye and from the nostrils. Otto
put his hand on it to quieten it, and
noticed that it was just about to lamb.
It looked a strong, healthy ewe, and Otto
cursed the crows that took advantage of
its temporary weakness.
He rolled it on to its other side, know-
ing that the wool underneath would be
wet from lying on the damp ground all
night, and so heavy that its weight had
prevented the sheep from rising. The
sheep seemed relieved and stretched its
cramped legs. It
made a few grunting
noises and the lamb’s
head appeared. Just
then the two dogs
arrived, panting
demonstratively. Full
of curiosity, they ran
to the ewe and
sniffed at it. The
ewe thrashed about
in terror: made a
frantic effort, got to its feet and ran
totteringly, leaning so far over towards
its wet side that it moved in a circle, col-
lapsing again a few yards from Otto.
He swore at the dogs, but they refused
to take him seriously, and confident in
their virtue came creeping against his legs
casting placatory glances at him while he
walked to the sheep. The ewe began to
struggle again as it saw the dogs, so
Otto gave each a nicely weighed and
measured kick: sufficient to convince
them he wanted them out of the way,
but not enough to send them home
offended. He rolled the sheep over again
so that the sun could dry its wet side, and
looked at the lamb.
It was still in the same position as
before, and though the ewe strained and
grunted, there was no progress. Otto
began to realise that something was
wrong. He hadn’t had much experience
with sheep; his father and old Heinrich
attending to them in the few years since
he’d been home from school. But he re-
called a lecture at his agricultural college.
The presentation should take place
front feet foremost; then the head rest-
ing on the legs. Clearly the silly lamb
had made a mistake; what old Taylor
called “malpresentation.” Otto watched
the ewe’s struggles and pondered while
his horse nibbled at the grass, trailing the
bridle.
The sheepdogs sat bolt upright a few
yards farther away, watching too, very
bright of eye and knowing; ears pricked
and giving little sideways nods with their
heads, and glancing at each other as if
they were sure they could soon put things
to rights if they were allowed to go about
it their own way. Meanwhile they were
being very good; only edging a little bit
nearer when Otto wasn’t looking, or when
his face looked as if he wouldn’t mind.
Otto was recollecting.
You washed hands and arms in dis-
infectant, and smeared them with vaseline.
(But while you were away doing that the
crows pecked out the eyes of both the
ewe and its half-bom lamb.) You re-
turned the lamb’s head; fished out the
front feet one at a time, allowed the head
to advance again ; pulled very gently and
very carefully, and all would be well.
But the ewe had no intention of allow-
ing the lamb’s head to be returned ; what-
ever strength she retained she concen-
trated on resisting retrogression, grunting
most outrageously.
Otto desisted ; the thing was obviously
hopeless; there was something wrong
with either the ewe or his instructions.
It was a very messy business, too, and
the lamb looked as if it was dead. He
didn’t know what he should do.
L_j E looked around, and the two dogs
A * came shuffling up on their bellies.
When he said nothing they leapt up with
their paws on his chest, pushing their
heads in front of his face to remind him
that they were more important than a
miserable half-dead sheep. When he
pushed them away absentmindedly, they
raced away in a wide circle, to stop sud-
denly, tails erect, hackles bristling, to
bark at something half a mile away at
the other end of the paddock. A bent
old man in a sulky with a slow, quiet
pony.
That would be old Heinrich ; he’d told
him this morning to go out and mend
that fence. Otto gave a quick look
around for his horse and caught it be-
fore it realised he was after it. He gal-
loped across to the tree where the nearest
crows were sitting, and waved and
shouted until they flew away; all except
the most insolent one, who wouldn’t move
though he shouted until the horse began
to rear and the dogs retreated cowering.
Otto dashed past the dogs, kicking his
horse for more speed, and looking back
at the crow. The dogs leapt out of his
way, looked at each other a moment
wonderingly, decided it was a lark and
went bounding after him in great glee.
OLD Heinrich was so absorbed in his
fencing job that it took quite a while
to make him understand that the morn-
lag’s order was being countermanded.
He was a tall, thin old man with
shoulders stooped from much hard work ;
mild trustful blue eyes, a long, aquiline
nose of the type somewhat loosely termed
aristocratic, suntanned and furrowed
face, an Adam’s apple and a lot of loose
wrinkled skin about the neck. When he
understood about the ewe his face fell
into worried furrows. He began to stare
about anxiously for the sheep with his
short-sighted old eyes. Otto said “Follow
me,” and was off; and after a few
moments of cogitation old Heinrich
clambered into the sulky and flicked the
pony into a sedate trot.
The crows were flying back. Otto
pounded with his heels until he could
feel the convulsive effort of his horse’s
strong muscles with each bounds He
began to shout when he was still two
hundred yards away, but now he didn’t
feel so desperately savage with them.. He
remembered his father saying, “Old
Heinrich’s the best man with lambing
ewes I ever saw.”
The crows departed reluctantly, but
fortunately they hadn’t had time to do
further damage. Old Heinrich arrived,
climbed creakily out of the sulky and
stood looking, making some clucking
noises with his tongue. The dogs, which
had enjoyed themselves chasing the crows
away, now returned and made an en-
thusiastic rush at the men, past the
sheep’s nose. The sheep made a des-
perate plunge, got to its feet, and be-
cause it was beginning to dry managed
to run off, though rather erratically.
Otto chased it, but soon realised that he
couldn’t catch it without what would be
a cruelly gruelling race to the ewe in its
present condition. He stopped and
looked at Heinrich.
Old Heinrich looked aside and rubbed
a hand over his face, embarrassed. He
didn’t know how to behave in the face
of his young employer’s dreadful error.
“What will we do now?” asked Otto.
“We can’t let her run about like that.”
Old Heinrich made an “Ah-rrr” noise
in his throat. Obviously, when he
attended to the sheep no dis-
tressed ewe was ever sent fly-
ing in a panic. But the dogs
were sure they knew what to
do. Their forepaws were on
Otto’s thighs and they looked
in his face, trying to make
him understand. They made
little runs in the direction of
the vanishing ewe, only wait-
ing a word of consent. Otto
said to Heinrich:
“I believe it would be best
to let the dogs catch her.
Better than letting her stagger about like
that.”
The dogs tore off without waiting for
more. Otto gave a yell and a whistle,
but they pretended not to hear him.
Th&y headed off the ewe, and because
she wouldn’t turn they got annoyed and
tackled her. One grabbed her by the
dewlap and the other got a grip on the
wool at her flank. She soon toppled,
and the dogs stood over her, half-pleased
and half-surprised that it had happened
so easily.
Otto came up at a run, scolding them
whenever one gave a tentative tug at her
wool, Heinrich followed with long stiff
strides. Otto sent the dogs away and
Heinrich knelt beside the ewe. „
“We’ll hafter get his legs out,” he
said.
“Our veterinary lecturer,” Otto com-
mented, “said you had to push the head
back first.”
Heinrich stopped, and a look of acute
distress came across his face.
“I always used to just get the legs out,”
he confessed, now utterly at a loss, be-
cause he was a very humble old fellow.
“You do it your way,” Otto en-
couraged him. “Dad always said there
wasn’t a better man with lambing ewes
than you.”
LJ EINRICH turned to the ewe to hide
1 1 a slow, delighted smile; hesitated a
moment and half-turned back again, then
made up his mind and put his hands on
the sheep with a sure, confident touch.
In a couple of minutes he was pulling
gently on the lamb’s' forelegs and it came
away easily.
The ewe gave a great sigh of relief and
lay quietly; breathing quickly and
deeply, its flanks rising and falling so
much that the fleece opened up and
closed with each breath.
“Nice work, Heinrich,” said Otto. “It’s
a pity the lamb’s dead, though.”
He picked up the lamb with his hand
under its chest, and it hung limply down
each side like a wet dishrag. Old Hein-
rich looked at it with his wrinkled face
puckered up, but said nothing. Then
suddenly the lamb’s legs began to squirm ;
it stiffened its body and drew in a deep
breath ; then it gave a sneeze, shook its
head and opened its eyes.
Otto and Heinrich looked at each other
smiling. Otto set the lamb on its legs
and it stood there swaying precariously
with its head hanging low.
“My word, that was marvellous,” Otto
exclaimed. “Coming to life in my hand
like that! ”
Old Heinrich grinned slyly, not saying
a word to indicate that he’d known all
along that there was a good chance of its
being alive.
’T' HEY stood there for a while, the old
* man and the young, listening to the
ewe’s heavy breathing, watching the
lamb moving its head slowly, searchingly
from side to side and edging gradually
towards the ewe, though it clearly didn’t
understand how it contrived to walk ; im-
pelled by the strong instinct of the young
animal seeking its mother.
Presently the ewe’s breathing eased. It
began to roll its eyes round at the men,
and the dogs, and horses. It made a sud-
den attempt to rise, but Heinrich caught
it by the wool.
“Ar, steady there,” he said, and the
ewe lay down again. He turned to Otto.
“When they’ve had trouble like this
they’ll often run for their lives and leave
the lamb and never come back.”
He added after a moment: “She’s been
so scared.”
He picked up the lamb and put if where
the ewe could see it, but the ewe threw
herself about in alarm and tried to get up
and run.
“It’ll want a lot of watching,” he said.
So they stayed there under the plea-
sant autumn sun while an aeroplane
changed from a. tiny spot in the south
to roar over them and dwindle to a speck
in the north. Heinrich stood the ewe on
her legs and held her while she swayed.
Whenever he let go she tried to leap
away. Otto put the lamb in front of her
again, but she backed away from it even
though it smelt confidently at her and
gave the first feeble little wag of its tail.
Old Heinrich said “Ah-rrr” a couple of
times, then added apologetically: “All
these people and horses and dogs around
it.”
So Otto said “I’ll go and look over the
Kurrajong and Trungley paddocks. I’ll
leave her to you and call back to see how
you get on.”
He jumped on his horse and the dogs
raced after him, delighted that all the
tedious hanging around was over.
WHEN Otto returned half an hour
later old Heinrich was working at
the fence again. He rode over towards
the ewe and stopped on the top of the
rise a§ soon as she came into view.
When the ewe saw Otto it became stiff
with hostility. It held up its head, walked
protectively in front of its lamb and
stamped with its front feet. Otto chuckled
to himself. His dogs arrived and looked
about wonderingly, standing on their
hind-legs to get a better view.
Then he was off again at a gallop;
pulling hard on the rein against the strong
curve of his horse’s neck. He felt extra-
ordinarily uplifted, far more than the
mere saving of a ewe and its lamb justi-
fied. He felt, as he bounded along
through the breaking wheat stubble, with
the horse’s hooves dubbing soundlessly
in the soil and his dogs following cun-
ningly in the wake the horse had cleared,
that somehow this morning he had caught
more than a glimpse of the grandeur of
life. He saw old Heinrich looking across
at him, and he waved an ami in cheerful
greeting.
Old Heinrich stared after him for a
long time, wondering if he was supposed
to do something.
Nerve Storm.
Since neither harried love nor wasteful
death
Could break me into weeping, since l
steeled
Myself with silence deadlier than breath
Against loud wrath, and. hoped that l
concealed
Whatever bitterness or fear might spoil
My victory of calm—since I could chain
My hands to all my unrewarding toil
With more indifference than l could feign.
My tolerance and my patience were my
boast
In private. Yet, my fathers being in me,
That merit belongs to some Griselda ghost
Whom / have failed, now my serenity
Crumples into the last disgrace of tears,
And for no reason, save perhaps the
years.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
THE U.N.O. FIASCO.
By an arresting coincidence,
the Paris session of the U.N.O.
General Assembly was under the
presidency of Dr. Evatt and was
its most complete and unrelieved
failure to date. It lifts the
already impressive record of Dr.
Evatt’s directorship of failures
on to the heights of genius.
Haying .watched the entire
• farce, Scripps-Howard foreign
■ editor William Philip Simms
, spoke of the whole show getting
: up to go home “after falling
down again”; but, by general
• consent, the fall had never been
i so utterly flat.
“The debates here,” Simms
, further commented, “together
\ with events in Berlin, have
proved that the world’s hope for
peace must depend on a Western
i alliance strong enough to stave
! off aggression, rather than on
the U.N. The organisation is
just as impotent and wordy as
the old League of Nations.”
The U.N.O. correspondent of
N. Y. “Times,” possibly un-
familiar with the Assembly
president’s unique record, quite
overlooked this in trying to de-
tect what blight or hoodoo could
have been on the show. “It is
difficult to decide,” he wrote in
his review or obituary of the
farce, “how much of responsi-
bility for a rather saddening
record rests upon Paris and its
charms. There is no question
of the fact that delegates have
had a much better time—and
have done much less work —than
they would have if they had been
forced to take the long com-
muters’ road from Manhattan
to Flushing Meadow and Lake
Success.”
Another cause of the flop
diagnosed by that Correspondent
was “the cynicism of many
delegates.” Previous meetings
of the Assembly, he recalled,
had been “slam-bang affairs,”
but “at this session, with the ex-
ception of a few tough speeches,
the proceedings were in a minor
key.”
Former U.S. Under-Secretary
of State Sumner Welles, a fer-
vent supporter of U.N.0., noted
“Marc Aurelio,” Rome.
ATOM-SHELTERS.
that “U.S. foreign policy is rele-
gating the United Nations to the
discard.” The summing-up of
the sad U.N.O. flop by foreign-
affairs writer William Henry
Chamberlin referred to U.N.O.’s
“impotence” and its “badly-
battered prestige”: “The mur-
der of the U.N. mediator Count
Folke Bernadotte by Jewish ex-
tremists in Jerusalem was more
than a personal tragedy. It was
symbolic of the helplessness of
the U.N. in vindicating its
authority and prestige.”
A “Wall-street Journal” cor-
respondent impolitely designated
the Evatt-Lie appeals to the
four Powers to get together and
compose their differences as
“rather silly appeals.” But for
thoroughly devastating comment
on the proceedings London
‘Times” probably led the field.
Conjuring up some of its old
thunder from the vaults, it
opened its post-mortem edi-
torial: “The General Assembly
of the United Nations has ad-
journed at last after 12 weeks
of acrimonious and futile discus-
sion To such a point has the
United Nations fallen from the
high hopes of San Francisco only
three years ago.”
The “Times” further remarked
that “After reading the list [of
what Dr. Evatt would call the
Assembly’s “achievements”] the
chief wonder is that the Latin-
American nations should have
thought it worth while to insist
that in future these proceedings
should be translated into Spanish
as well as into French and Eng-
lish at the cost of another
£75,000 a year.”
If U.N.O, is to continue at all,
the same sulphurous comment
added, “it must be saved from
the ignominy of the recent
session in Paris, which has corf-
tributed nothing to peace and
understanding and not a little
to distrust and ill-will.”
Hurdles for E.R.P.
Quite apart from any such
political possibilities as a Com-
munist take-over in very shaky
France, which could upset the
whole works overnight, a Wash-
ington correspondent of
“Christian Science Monitor”
sees the following hurdles ahead
of the European Recovery Pro-
gramme :
1. Failure to build up East-
West trade in Europe to any-
where near the proportion con-
sidered necessary for success of
the programme. There are esti-
mates that if such trade is not
developed E.R.P. could cost
Uncle Sam another
$1,000,000,000 to $1,500,000,000
a year.
2. The prospect of further in-
flation that eats away the value
of aid that ■ a dollar will buy.
Britain, for example, figures that
its costs of imported food and
raw materials went up 10 per
cent, in the first half of 1948
due to rising costs.
3. The possibility that military
lend-lease will cut into the
E.R.P. programme, either in dol-
lars appropriated for that pur-
pose or in the recovery pro-
gramme of Western European
nations.
4. The failure so far of the
European countries to take steps
of co-operation and co-ordina-
tion that assure a continued
united programme after E.R.P.
ends. So far there has been little
evidence of those countries
adopting the fiscal, economic
and tariff - union agreements
which were envisaged when
E.R.P. was created.
5. Lack of monetary reforms
in many of the countries, neces-
sary if there is to be economic
progress and an easing of ex-
change problems. All of the
E.R.P. countries have agreed to
make needed financial and
monetary reforms looking to-
ward stabilising their currencies.
6. Finally, the danger that
with economic recovery in
Europe will come a double-
edged apathy that could defeat
the programme: namely, Wash-
ington’s hesitancy to continue
E.R.P. at the volume needed to
make it succeed; and Europe’s
unwillingness to co-operate eco-
nomically as conditions im-
prove.
The Churchill Touch.
When Churchill, back in the
wishful ’thirties, was invited to
an official dinner to Ribbentrop
in London, he said it was some-
thing of a surprise in view of
his denunciations of the Nazi
war-preparations, and com-
mented: “Ah, well, I suppose
they wanted to show him they
keep a bulldog that can bark,
and might bite.”
The old bulldog can still do
both, with characteristic bulldog
good-humor. He opened his
notable House of Commons
speech on foreign affairs a week
or two back by saying he joined
in the general welcome to Mr.
Bevin on his return to the House
after a well-deserved and much-
needed holiday. He could assure
Mr. Bevin, he said, that in wel-
coming him back the Opposition
felt that there would be no great
harm to the public interest if
further and prolonged holidays
were taken not only by him but
by those of his colleagues who
sat with him.
Then he turned to the import-
ance of British-U.S. friendship
and to that “tremendous event”
the promise of a U.S. guarantee
to Western Europe, coupled with
practical measures of military co-
operation, the most remarkable
of all the measures of which col-
laboration, he said, was “the
stationing of an American
bomber-squadron in our bases in
East Anglia.”
Mr. Solly (Lab.) interjecting:
“Shame! We do not want
them.”
Mr. Churchill: “The signi-
ficance of such a measure has
not been lost on anyone, least of
all on any potential enemies of
this country’s interests.”
German Reparations.
In a striking review of Ger-
man-reparation allotments to
date, a special correspondent of
London “Times” leaves the im-
pression that, the way things are
going, Fritz may wriggle out as
comfortably as he did in 1919.
The writer states it is unlikely
that the Inter-Allied Reparations
Agency has up to now received
plants from the Western zones
worth more than about
£30,000,000 —little more than
Britain alone spent in any two
days of 1944.
To that can be added a small
amount for scrap and some
£12,000,000 for merchant ships—
altogether an astonishingly low
total, despite the outcry against
dismantling of plants (for repara-
tions purposes) which has been
raised not only in Germany but
even more insistently in America.
The Russians have, of course,
taken a heavy tribute from their
zone.
A particularly “disturbing
feature” noted by the writer is
that the Germans appear to have
succeeded in concealing a large
amount of external assets also
scheduled as reparations. The
Swiss Government, for instance,
which had confiscated important
German holdings, had failed to
release more than 1 per cent, of
the agreed total. Powerful in-
terests such as the Munich Re-
insurance Corporation and its
branches abroad are still largely
intact. Many German assets in
South America have escaped
liquidation. Speaking soon after
the end of the war—since when
little change has been recorded —
the then U.S. Assistant-Secre-
tary of State, William Clayton,
pointed out that Argentina had
failed to eliminate a single case
of suspected German econoniic
penetration. There were at that
time, Clayton said, 104 cases of
Axis business in Argentina
against which no action had
been taken.
Compared with the Versailles
settlement the Germans have
had to pay—at least from the
Western zones, which comprise
two-thirds of Germany and most
of her industrial capacity—only
a small fraction of what they
paid after 1918.
The writer also declares that
the productive equipment of
Western Germany may, in any
permanent sense, be said to have
largely escaped from the respon-
sibilities of Hitler’s aggression.
—Denver ( U.S.A .) “Post”
THE POOL IS GROWING SMALLER.
“Its massive industries in the
Ruhr and Rhineland stand more
or less intact. Its capacity to
produce valuable consumer
goods, enormously swelled by
the needs of war, is almost as
large today as it was in 1944.
Germany’s foreign assets are re-
duced but by no means elimin-
ated ; and she may even turn out
to have suffered less in this re-
spect than the British. Her
merchant fleet has gone, but al-
ready there are plans afoot to
set aside the somewhat harsh
and unrealistic ban imposed by
Potsdam and to begin building
ocean-going ships. For this and
other needs, she disposes of a
steel-making capacity which —
unless present American inten-
tions are greatly revised —is not
likely to prove much less than
19,000,000 tons.
“How quickly her industrialists
may be able to recover, once
they are sure of having eluded
the individual consequences of
defeat and are prepared to put
their backs into recovery, is sug-
gested by the upward swing of
production since the currency
reform in the Western zones.
Output has risen from about 40
per cent, last May to more than
70 per cent today—taking as a
basis 1936, when nearly a quarter
of output went into rearmament.
It would not be surprising in
view of all this if the supposed
ruin of Germany after 1945 did
not prove as complete a myth as
it did after 1918.”
“Big-Four” Meeting.
As reported in cables, Dr.
Evatt, striving to gloss over the
all - too - obvious fact that
U.N.O.’s session in Paris was its
most dismai failure to date,
allotted blame indiscriminately
among the leading Powers.
It was in that spirit he co-
operated in trying to arrange a
further “Big-Four” meeting, on
which a Scripps-Howard corres-
pondent who watched the
U.N.O. Paris flop has com-
mented :
“What Russia really wants
most is another Big Four
Foreign Ministers’ meeting.
“Every German, whether in
the Soviet or the Western zones,
wants an end of foreign occupa-
tion. Every German wants a
unified country under its own
Government whose capital
would be Berlin. Without, of
course, saying that such a Ger-
many would be just another
Soviet vassal like Poland and
others, Russia is already promis-
ing all of these. She is doing
her utmost to make the Ger-
mans think the U.S., Britain and
France are the ones blocking a
free and united Germany.
“A meeting of the Big Four
Foreign Ministers is precisely
the place from which to carry on
this propaganda.”
Young Criminals.
“Today we are faced with the
situation that all our young
people are growing up in a
society which is demonstrably
less honest than hitherto, and
that whereas our fathers taught
us to distinguish the clear differ-
ence between black and white,
we are now encouraged to be-
lieve that there are several shades
of grey.”
Thus C. A. Joyce, headmaster
of the Cotswold School, Wilt-
shire, joining in the recent
London “Times” correspond-
ence-discussion of the alarming
increase in juvenile delinquency.
In the experienced teacher's
view, the trouble is caused very
largely by a lack of ethical in-
struction. As a result, many
have grown up in the belief that
“I want” and “I take” are the
same verb, and “since they have
been given no reason to believe
in the hereafter they know that
honesty is not the best policy”:
“The present situation is
summed up in the answer of a
boy who, when the housemaster
said: ‘Don’t you know what
good, honest behavior is?’ re-
plied: ‘No. What good is it?’ ”
.On the effects of the State
usurping the place of the parents
(referred to by other cor-
respondents), the writer com-
mented: “I think we are on
extremely dangerous ground
when we begin by accepting the
axiom that if little Willie's
father cannot afford to buy a
bicycle, then someone else [i.e.,
the State] should pay for it. Is
there not some support for the
view that little Willie might be
taught to go without until such
time as the bicycle may be
obtained legitimately and with-
out charity?. ... In this same
vein one has often heard it sug-
gested that shopkeepers have no
right to display goods without
adequate safeguard, but here
again it is my submission that
children should be brought up
with some respect for other
people’s property.”
Further on this theme of the
failure of early instruction—a
failure, of course, as much of
education and educators as of
parents—the writer concluded:
“It seems to me little short of
tragic that we wait until
these children are committed to
approved schools, Borstal insti-
tutions and prisons before we
begin to give them the ele-
mentary ethical instruction of*
which they are in such sore need.
I submit we need teachers upon
whose moral standards we insist
as much as upon their academic
qualifications, and that it should
be made clear that most
delinquents are no more nor
less normal than we ourselves.
It is my experience that almost


all our criminals come from
homes where there has been an
absence of discipline.”
Tito’s Troubles.
In the Devil’s Dictionary of
the Corns, the formerly desig-
nated “People’s President Mar-
shal Tito” is now, a Scripps-
Howard” correspondent notes,
“Opportunistic Stooge of the
Capitalists Tito.”
Recent reports from Belgrade
have shown Tito bearing up
passably well under the barrage
of such endearments, but, by his
own words, he is evidently seri-
ously troubled by the economic
ostracism imposed by other
satellite countries, under Krem-
lin orders.
He is not considered to be
actually leaning Westward on
such account, but a Geneva
correspondent of N. Y. “Times”
has reported that “Yugoslavia
is seeking metallurgical coke in
Western Europe to make up for
deficiencies caused by the clamp-
ing-down on Polish exports”
that formerly went to Tito.
In a recent speech, described
by the same paper’s Belgrade
correspondent as “perhaps the
frankest assessment of the in?
temal situation of a country
ever made by a Communist
leader,” Tito clearly indi-
cated that he is having trouble
with his country’s peasant com-
munity, and also that he realises
the plans for making Yugoslavia
over to the Soviet pattern have
been too grandiose altogether
and will have to be cut down.
“The first five-year plan,”
Tito said, “originated at a time
when relations with our allies
[Moscow and its puppets] were
much more favorable than they
are today. We did not count on
any kind of material gifts—or
anyone giving us help without
value in return, but we hoped
we would be extended a friendly
hand and friendly help, and we
would be given value for value
in such a way that we would be
giving them what they need and
they would give us what we
need. Today the situation is
different. Today, not through our
fault, certain conditions have
come about that precisely this
position—help from friendly
Socialist countries —has declined
to a great extent, and for this
reason we have greater difficul-
ties than otherwise.”
Referring to “co-operative
centres and other projects” hav-
ing been “put up everywhere”
under the early extravagant
plans, and indicating that it was
now necessary to pull in horns a
bit, Tito declared: “I am certain,
comrades, that someone outside
our country who hears what I
am saying will say these people
have made megalomaniacal
plans and now they cannot carry
them out. This will be said not
only by imperialists but also by
those who are criticising ( us in a
yery strange way. But we

answer: we will carry out our
plan—and carry it out we shall.”
To that frank admission of
Communist-nationalising failure
Tito added even more revealing
.indications of troubles which,
one day, might well blow up all
round the satellite belt. Com-
munist party-leaders and rank-
and-file members, he said, must
Jake a more humanistic view of
the people of Yugoslavia in
their dealings with them ; it was
no good commanding them to
do things. He said the proper
approach was one of education
and consistent and persistent ex-
planation of problems. Also,
that there were too many
shortages of basic necessities
such as matches and oil for
lamps, and that the peasants’
reaction was that a Government
that could not solve such prob-
lems was a weak Government.
Madame Chiang.
As pictured in his diary some
years back by U.S. Lieut-
General (“Vinegar Joe”) Stilwell:
“A clever, brainy woman ; sees
the Western viewpoint. (By this
I mean she can appreciate the
mental reactions of a foreigner
to the twisting, indirect and
undercover methods of Chinese
politics and warmaking.) Direct,
forceful, energetic. Loves power.
Eats up publicity and flattery.
Pretty weak on her history. * No
concessions to the Western view-
point in all China’s foreign rela-
tions. The Chinese were always
right; the foreigners were always
wrong. Writes entertainingly but
superficially, with plenty of sar-
casm for Western failings, but
without mention of any of
China’s little faults. Can turn
on charm at will, and knows it.
Great influence on Chiang Kai-
shek —mostly along right lines,
too. A great help on several
occasions.”
Madame certainly would need
all her understanding of the re-
actions of foreigners to reconcile
the chilliness of the recent U.S.
official reception of her with the
war-time reactions to her charm
in the same quarters.
U.S. in China.
In a general survey of the
present U.S. outlook on China,
the Washington correspondent
of London “Times” substantially
agrees with interpretations al-
ready given here —that Uncle
Sam hates the idea of a com-
plete Corrtmunist takeover, but
has had enough of Chiang Kai-
shek.
The correspondent points to
two contrasting factors which
make U.S. action more difficult
in East Asia than in Europe:
(1) The absence of a group of
Powers, or even of a single
country, with a tradition of
democratic government, to
which a Pacific edition of the
European Recovery Programme
could be applied with hope of
success; (2) “the guilty con-
science felt throughout the
United States over the treatment
of China at Yalta.”
It is to that “guilty conscience”
that Chiang Kai-shek has lately
appealed; his appeal was not
published in America, but was
reported from-Nanking to have
blamed the Yalta agreement for
the present trouble, Chiang Kai-
shek claiming that the U.S. was
therefore under an obligation to
help his Government in the
present crisis. In the same re-
gard, the “Times” man quotes
a statement by UJS. Deputy-
Chief-of-Staff General Wede-
meyer to a Congress committee
that “the United States has not
kept its promises to China, while
the Chinese Government has
kept its promises to the United
States.”
Such factors notwithstanding,
propaganda against Chiang Kai-
shek has latterly swamped any-
thing advanced in his favor in
the U.S., a lot being made of
defections and graft in the
Nationalist “fighting” forces.
The “Times” man gives a few
of the details that have been
Washington “Post."
“I’D LIKE TO GET YOU ON A SHOWBOAT TO CHINA."
carrying considerable weight:
“According to the best Ameri-
can information, 33 divisions of
the Nationalist armies have sur-
rendered in the last six months ;
during the last 12 months
236,000 rifles have been lost,
which is twice as many as the
United States supplied during the
period. There is good evidence
that the divisions with most
arms are being approached by
Communist agents and are selling
American equipment as fast as it
is delivered. Yet even now, at
the end of these defeats, it is esti-
mated that the two opposing
forces are about equal in man-
power and material. Even those
who disagree with Mr. Marshall
are compelled to recognise that
there must be grave weaknesses
on the Nationalist side and to
admit that, where there are
neither ideals, nor morale,
weapons can do little.”
The conclusion of the London
“Times” survey of the U.S. posi-
tion is that “there is no reason
to think there will be any change
in Mr. Marshall’s attitude [which
is decidedly unfavorable to
Chiang Kai-shek] or any weak-
ening of Mr. Truman’s support
of Mr. Marshall.”
Exit U.S. Isolationism.
How completely isolationism
has been eclipsed in the U.S. is
indicated by former diehard-
isolationist N. Y. “Daily News”
opposing further aid to China on
the same ground that the fervent
internationalists stand on: that
it would “weaken U.S. help to
Western Europe, with its heavy
industries and skilled labor,
which is the most valuable prize
Russia could win in the ‘cold
war’.”
The U.S. frontiers have cer-
tainly advanced a bit when the
same Old Guard of isolationism
can further comment on this
theme:
“Suppose the worst comes to
the worst, and China does go
under the thumbs of Chou
En-lai, Mao Tse-tung, Chu Teh,
Chen Yi and the other rascals
who are stooging for Stalin in
the ancient Oriental country.
Then what?
“Well, there are some
450,000,000 people in China, as
against perhaps 200,000,000 in
the Soviet Union. The average
Chinese has always had a great
contempt for any kind of gov-
ernment. He would probably
sabotage dictatorship from
Moscow with enthusiasm
especially if Moscow tried to
fasten the collective-farm system
on China’s individualistic, land-
avaricious farmers.
“It looks as if the Kremlin
would bite off a terrific mouthful
it it should get technical control
of China. If that control ever
could be made actual (which we
doubt), the job would take years
and years, and would use up
much of the energy which
Moscow is now throwing into
other cold-war sectors, especially
the West-Europe sector.
“While the Soviets were dis-
sipating their energies in China,
we [U.S.A.] could press for for-
mation of a United States of
Western Europe as a strong eco-
nomic and military union, and
could build up our r defences
along the line Alaska-Guam-
Philippines—not to mention im-
proving on the friendship which
the Japanese people now have
for us.”
Soviet Science.
President of the Royal Society
from 1940 to 1945, Sir Henry
Dale lately resigned from his
honorary membership of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences be-
cause it now accepts as its high
priest T. D. Lysenko, “the ad-
vocate of a doctrine of evolution
which, in effect, denies all the
progress made by research since
Lamarck’s speculations appeared
early in the nineteenth century.”
In resigning, he wrote to the
president of the Soviet
Academy:
“Since Galileo was driven by
threats to his historic denial
there have been many attempts
to suppress or to mutilate scien-
tific truth in the interests of some
extraneous creed, but none has
had a lasting success ; Hitler’s
was the most recent failure. Be-
lieving, Mr. President, that you
and your colleagues must be act-
ing under a like coercion, I can
only offer you my respectful
sympathy. For my own part,
being free to choose, I believe
that I should do disservice even
to my scientific colleagues in the
U.S.S.R. if I were to retain an
association in which I might ap-
pear to condone the actions by
which your academy, under
whatever compulsion, is now
responsible for such a terrible
injury to the freedom and the
integrity of science.”
Dragnet Digest.
Unkind to Polls. —From a Washing-
ton “Post” leader, the most unkindest
cut of all so far struck at the “public-
opinion” polls: “According to a news
item from London, the Colonial Office
has discovered that three per cent, of
the British people think the United
States is still a British colony. Three
per cent, comes to about 1,440,000
persons who are supposed to hold this
curious belief. We have a horrible
suspicion that the figure is based on
a public-opinion poll. Perhaps, there-
fore, it ought to be dismissed as
palpably inaccurate.”

Fears of U.S. Eric Johnston,
president of the U.S. Motion Picture
Assoc., interviewed after visiting
Europe: “One of the great fears of
Europe, inspired by Russian propa-
ganda, is that America is imperialistic
—I am talking of the liberals in
Western Europe, those men and
women who are not Communists and
do not want to be Communists. Many
of them have great misconception
about the United States. We can do
something about that. We can bring
over labor-union leaders, newspaper-
men, schoolteachers to America —let
them see that we do have wooden
houses, that some of our houses do
not have bathtubs, that we are not a
super-race with super-gadgets.”
* * * *
Rearming Poland. —Reporting from
Warsaw that the Communist-domi-
nated Government there is rearming
Poland, a “Christian Science Moni-
tor” correspondent adds: “This is
shown in the growing stream of
Russian war material flowing to the
Polish Army and in a number of
other important military measures.
Among these is the decision to halt
the departure of Russian officers
attached to the Polish Army, and the
haste with which former airfields in
western Poland and in Polish East
Prussia, partly damaged and disused
since the war, are being cleared and
restored.” Arms being supplied, the
correspondent further states, include
“some of the newest Russian tanks
and field-guns.”
* * * *
Malayan Corns’ Setback. —Review-
ing the Communist gains in China,
London “Times” editorially com-
ments that “The most notable set-
back the Communists have sustained
[in Asia] has been in Malaya,”
where “the rebellion has been halted”
and “the attitude of Malays, domiciled
Chinese and Indians in supporting
the Government has exposed the
hollowness of the claim that a caucus
of immigrant Chinese and Javanese
deserve to be called nationalists.*’
Also, “Economic sabotage has met
with no better success; the produc-
tion of tin and rubber, vital for
European recovery, has surpassed last
year’s figures. The trade-unions, freed
from Communist manipulation, have
secured steady work.”
* * * *
V.S. Handicaps. —Hearst-press com-
ment by Major-Gen. Barrows: “Our
[U.S.] representatives in the adminis-
tration and in negotiations within the
United Nations are inexperienced and
unreliable. They do not have the
knowledge or the strength of charac-
ter that have been slowly developed
in other countries by centuries of
international controversy and danger.
And the idea that our foreign policies
must at every step be submitted to
international judgment and approval,
and must be executed through an in-
ternational organisation that is not
only weak but will not support us
in any critical situation, is the main
thing that confounds us and defeats
us.”

Jap Trade—Pointed comment in a
“Foreign Affairs” article by a writer
who served as scientific adviser with
the U.S. occupation forces: “If
Japan is to be removed. from the
relief rolls, on which she now draws
about $400,000,000 a year from
American taxpayers, and put on her
own feet, she must be given access to
markets overseas. In a recent speech
Under-Secretary of the U.S. De-
partment of the Army William Draper
estimated that Japanese exports must
increase ‘to almost seven times the
present level before they can pay for
food and raw materials necessary to
provide a tolerable standard of living
for the Japanese nation.’ This im-
plies a generosity of treatment and
unanimity of understanding among the
Allied Powers that, to say the least,
had best not be taken for granted.”
* * *• *
Canada’s Immigrants. Since the
end of the war, a Chicago “Tribune”
Ottawa correspondent reports, immi-
gration to Canada (including displaced
persons) has reached 254,000, with a
further 100,000 arranged for next year.
With more than half the total, Britain
easily leads in supplying the largest
single group.

Why Asia Suits Corns. —A staff
writer of N. Y. “Times” notes a
basic point in the current world
clash of opposing systems: that
wherever Soviet Communism moves
to the east or to the south —in Central
or Eastern Asia —it brings with it a
broadly higher standard of living,
but wherever it moves to the west —into
Europe—it brings with it a lower
standard of living. Therefore, Com-
munism has a much better chance
of remaining in the areas it embraces
in Asia than in areas it overruns in
Europe.

Anglo-Italian Friendship. Stating
editorially that Mr. Harold Macmillan
was speaking for many besides himself
when he pleaded, in a speech at Milan,
for “the strengthening of British-
Italian relations as a useful instru-
ment of peace and European welfare”
and declared that “From a strategic
point of view the Mediterranean is
one wing of a defence system of
which Benelux represents the other,”
London “Times” commented: “Only
the much-disputed future of the
former Italian colonies, where Britain
and the Powers have other binding
obligations to observe, now seems to
stand in the way—if the Italians
adhere without compromise to their
claim for ‘justice to Italy’—of friendly
and practical agreement.”
* * * * .
A French Realist. —As indicated by
various “Uncabled Additions,” one of
the points made to U.N.O.’s credit in
overseas comment is that it serves to
keep Soviet policy-moves where the
world can see them, and the Kremlin
is sensitive about Kremlin frauds.
Even this small credit is disallowed
in a Scripps-Howard report of a
dialogue at the U.N.O. press table.
“What good,” asked the Frenchman,
“will it do to get a resolution con-
demning Russia as a threat to world
peace?” U.S. Correspondent: “It is
bound to have a considerable effect
on world opinion.” Frenchman:
“But the men in the Kremlin don’t
care the slightest about world opinion.
They merely want to win, and don’t
care how they do it. And if they
can stall long enough and produce
enough chaos, misery and mass bit-
terness, they will win."


THE SONS OF NIM
BY GEOFF BINGTTAM
NIM THORGOOD was a small
brightly black-eyed Norwegian, and
it was a pity he ever died.
The Coolbucca people were sure
that they hadn’t recently received fuel
anything like the bloodwood and tallow-
wood blocks Nim supplied. Twenty miles
he carted it, charging seven shillings for
a piled dray-load. There are many tales
told about Nim and his sawn blocks, and
how he always demanded cash, how
the then Mayor of Coolbucca, Mr. James
Portland, had had a load delivered, and
after inspecting the load had pronounced
himself satisfied.
“Very good, my man,” he said. “I shall
order more, I think.”
Nim Thorgood, who seemed not to have
absorbed this latter information, held out
his hand for the cash.
“Ah, yes,” said Mr. Portland. “Send
the bill in, I pay all accounts monthly.”
He then went on speaking to a councillor,
and completely ignored Nim.
Nim began loading the blocks on to his
dray. “No monthly. She ain’t monthly,”
he was saying to himself. Mr. James
Portland looked around and saw with
dismay that he was losing his load.
“Hey!” he shouted.
“She ain’t monthly,” said Nim. He
threw some more blocks on the dray to
prove that.
“Now look here,” said Mayor Port-
land, who had never been refused a
monthly, or even a six-monthly, consid-
eration. “Look here, old chap!”
“Ain’t no monthly,” said Nim. And
a few more blocks went on, after which
the Mayor parted with seven shillings and
a small amount of dignity. Nim always
exacted immediate payment.
NIM had started with an axe, a cross-
cut saw and a wife, all Norwegian.
After a time he bought an engine, and
set up a sawbench. The engine, when it
came, was drawn from nowhere by three
large draughts, and seemed a burden for
them. When Nim started it up everyone
voted him either a very brave or foolish
man, and the crowd which came to watch
regarded the phenomenon from a safe
distance, which was considered to be about
four hundred yards, and when it began
puffing and blowing they retreated even
further than that, and when, finally, Nim
decided to let off steam, or rather to allow
the engine to do so, then every cow in
Garland’s Point and environs gathered its
udder and ran, and worn-out draughts
kicked up their heels and went careering
across the stumped paddocks.
Nim made history with that engine
and his circular-saw. He cut more wood
than he carted, and many said he would
have had that amount again were the
engine not so avaricious, but Nim seemed
not to mind, and gave himself to sawing
more, and carting more, whilst his wife
hurriedly gave birth to children, five sons,
who in no time appeared to be as tall as
their small father.
Sach was the eldest, and then Lash, and
when Sach was ready to work he decided
that milled timber might be a good thing,
and told his father so. Nim, when he
had allowed the idea to sink in, became
quite excited and rushed off to Sydney to
buy a new machine. The great iron-clad
puffing-billy drove the new engine, and
they had sawn timber for housing.
This enabled Nim to put skillions on
the northern, the eastern and the southern
sides of the original building he had con-
structed for his wife and the children, so
ffiat there was no longer any overcrowd-
ing, even if the house appeared to ramble
somewhat. Nim could not help admiring
his own handiwork, and would often
look up from his sawing and spend a few
moments in contemplation. For the most
Part, however, he continued to saw block-
wood, and allow Sach to mill the other
timber.
When Lash was able to partner Sach he
suggested a machine for dressing the
timber, and Nim, again excited, went to
Sydney. It was after that the district was
well supplied with slabs, sawn and
dressed, and dressed strips to nail over
the cracks where the slabs had shrunk.
When Noll came along he proved to
be somewhat of a mechanic, so that they
were able to fix their own machines and
save money on maintenance. The main
thing about Noll, however, apart from
his work, was his violin. Somehow he
had shown an aptitude for this instru-
ment, had been trained in its use, and
was capable of producing the most un-
usual music from its strings. Nim, alone,
recognised the Norwegian in the boy,
although he said nothing about that. He
allowed Noll to play for the dances at
the Garland’s Point Hall, but mostly Noll
played for the family, in the big central
room where the meals were cooked, where
they ate and lived and entertained.
There Noll would play, and Nim, listen-
ing, would be reminded of his own
Norway by the sea, and all that it meant,
and after Noll had finished his playing
Nim would tell the family various old
tales, in which they appeared to take only
a polite and casual interest.
AFTER Noll there were Lars and
Sammy. They were just two more
like the others, short spare men, with no
blfckside to speak of, dropping in a
straight line from shoulders to heels, and
tapered a little, so that they appeared to
be much the same when viewed from
front, sides or rear.
The Thorgoods, then, were a united
family, with the mill as their central pivot-
point, and labor in it their delight. If
there was any difference anywhere
amongst the boys it existed in Sammy,
who was the youngest, and for whom the
entire family maintained a special affec-
tion. Sammy worked as hard as the other
brothers when it came to his time to
work, but he was allowed a skillion all on
his own, whereas the other brothers were
forced to share, and Sammy, in some way,
did seem a trifle different, although he
was not anxious to emphasise differences,
but clung, strongly, to a sameness.
It was when old Nim died that Sammy
showed the difference. He wept where
the others were simply solemn, and at the
funeral cried incessantly “Daddy!
Daddy! ” whereas the boys, and even
their mother, seemed more bewildered
than sorry, as though they dimly felt that
they would miss old Nim and his dray
with the careful mixture of bloodwood
and tallowwood blocks. Nim always
strongly asserted that tallowwood and
bloodwood were made to burn together.
AFTER Nim died the Second World
War broke out, and the boys, having
grown sufficiently by that time, were
eligible for it, although they did not
immediately enlist. It took quite some
time for enthusiasm to filter through to
Garland’s Point, and then another period
of time elapsed before that enthusiasm
penetrated the roar and
whistling of the mill, and it
was not until the Lanyon
brothers enlisted —three in all
—and there was a patriotic
meeting called at Coolbuccal
and two boys from Wirril
Creek joined the Army that
the Thorgoods really knew
there was a war on.
At about that time the in-
,.:W, vasion of Norway was
quickly accomplished, much to the
indignation of the old Thorgood
woman, who immediately insisted that
the boys go across to Europe and do
something. Nothing loth, Sach enlisted,
but he demanded that only Lash might
enlist with him, for, apart from Norway,
the mill was what counted. Noll, how-
ever, overrode Sach and enlisted with him,
so that that meant three Thorgoods in
the Army, and Mrs. Thorgood relaxed
somewhat, feeling that Norway was in
good hands, whilst the mill might easily
be run by Lars and Sammy.
After a time Lars became morose, and
nothing less than the Air Force would
please him. Sammy said it was no use
one working a mill, and that, anyway, he
just couldn’t manage it,, and he revealed
to his mother that Norway was what he
was worried about, and this pleased the
old woman immensely, so that she con-
sented to be left on her own, and with no
sons to look after she took care of the
mill. Sach, however, did not allow his
mother to remain long alone, for one
week-end he brought home a wife, a
Sydney girl who was, nevertheless, sen-
sible. She took up the northern skillion.
Lash, home on leave, decided to marry
a Garland’s Point girl, a sister of Alan
Lanyon, who was in his battalion. She
took the eastern skillion and kept Mrs.
Thorgood, senior, and the other Mrs.
Thorgood company. Then the boys went
overseas, much to the old woman’s relief,
as she had not ceased thinking about
Norway’s plight.
Sammy wrote no word home, and it
was fully six months before they found
out that he was in the Merchant Navy.
This was not, perhaps, considered to be
a fighting force, but it was the next thing
to it, and Mrs. Thorgood was satisfied.
She superintended the weekly oiling of
machines, remembering the roar and the
noise of the mill in its working days, and
hoped all her boys would return.
The news filtered through that Noll
had been promoted to an entertainment
group, but it was to be understood that
he, Noll, would be in the fighting when it
came along, or, as he said, he’d be there
when the whips were cracking. Army,
Air Force and Merchant Navy; Mrs.
Thorgood was puzzled about the delayed
release of Norway. She thought, per-
haps, that insufficient notice had been
taken of her boys, and that they had been
held back, through jealousy, from launch-
ing a quick and effective campaign. She
was puzzled when the boys returned from
England and the Middle East, but
accepted the fact calmly, and even, some
months later, the birth-of a son to Sach,
and a son, also, to Lash.
THEN the war came to a conclusion,
and after a time the boys returned,
that is, with the exception of Sammy,
who had either been killed or was de-
tained in the Merchant Navy. The wel-
come-home dance to the Thorgoods was
a terrific affair, everyone in the district
turning up, especially the girls, who ad-
mired Lars in his blue uniform and
adored Noll’s playing. Some said Noll
would be a fool to go back to the mill
when he could play like that. “Divine,”
most of the girls called it, and there were
not a few who looked knowing, as though
they had discovered a genius in Noll, un-
beknown to Noll, but since they were
unable or reluctant to contact someone
great who would recognise Noll he re-
turned to the mill with the three brothers,
and very hard they worked to restore it

Wakeful in the Township.
Cries the lonely dog all night,
Swims in the stream the shadowy fish.
Who would live in a country town
If they had their wish ?
When the sun comes hurrying up
I will take the circus train
That cries once, once in the night
And then not again.
In the stream the shadowy fish
Sleeps below the sleeping fly.
Many, many around me sleep
But not I.
Near my window a drowsy bird
Flickers its feathers on the thorn.
Around the township’s single light
My cousins die and are born.
1 will join the circus train
For mangy leopard and tinsel girl
And the galloping horses’ gpeat white
haunches,
Whiter than a pearl.
When to the dark blue mountains
My captive pigeons flew
I’d no heart to lure them back
With wheat upon the dew.
When the dog at morning
Barks upon the frost
I shall be in another place
Lost, lost, lost. *

Through the inert >rock of no change
Probes a staccato vibrant drill;
Sound to the silent beds of stone,
Friction with heat to ageless chill.
Darkness, unconscious t undisturbed,
Must yield to charge of dynamite;
Forgotten bubbles in the earth
Bared to an unaccustomed light
Yield now their appalling secret hoards:
The fossil shells, the history;
Truths simple, logical and yet
Most complicated mystery,
Down in the darkness are the roots
From the first cell to the last brain.
Steam-shovels crammed with ancient soil
Scoop out, fling forth, swing in again.
This shell-shape is a frightening thing
Lying cold and sullen, wrenched from
stone,
A deathless death in the daylight,
Life's replica of life unknown.
The drill is harsh and fills with sound
The air, the earth splits with its strain ;
All powerful—but it cannot find
Where joy comes from, or fear, or pain.
Is it there, the answer and the proof
Of strange chance growth and marvellous
rise ?
Man with his feet on fossil coils
And shattered atoms in his eyes?

Through plodding hours and the un-

THE PAST AND THE FUTURE.
Australia has had a good history, one
unprecedented in the story of colonisation
and development. It has been completely
free of war on its own soil, save for a
little bombing 2000 miles from its centres
of population. It has had a virgin
country to develop, and the timing
of its epochs has been such that one
could almost believe that they were de-
liberately planned by a divine Providence.
Wool, for instance, became a matter
of supreme importance to British manu-
facturers, who were the real fathers of
the Australian sheep industry, at almost
the exact moment when the first steps had
been taken in New South Wales to open
up the interior of the continent, so suit-
able for its production. Macquarie came
back from the founding of Bathurst just
a month before Waterloo.
In the era when communication had
been speeded up to the point at which it
was possible to bring in a large popula-
tion here quickly, gold was discovered
in big quantities and acted as a bait. But
if it were not for wool and the fact
that at the period the demand began to
grow for it there were here a few sheep
of Spanish strain —brought by accident,
more or less, on the initiative of Governor
King, who happened to be at the Cape
of Good Hope when their owner died —
Australia would be a poor and meagre
land. And if it had not been for gold
it could not have expected, at its distance
from the great centres of civilisation, to
have acquired the choice, adventurous and
homogeneous population which developed
it. It needed, at the times when the tide
flowed strongest, more than ordinary in-
ducement to bring them hither, and for-
tunately Australia was not the lush type
of land that appeals to Asiatics.
This country has grown rapidly
in conditions in which droughts have not
brought a single real famine, and occa-
sional depressions have never reduced
living to- the normal standard of relatively
prosperous Balkan and East European
countries. It has grown in 160 years to
the point at which its leaders consider it a
world Power and at which standards of
existence are basically the easiest in the
world. Working girls who are privileged
to live in it dress like the rich of a few
years ago. Leisure is all too abundant,
and it is generally true to say that workers
only work when they feel like it, irrespec-
tive of the needs of the community.
Money pours through the shops. The
chief things which are in decline are the
basic sources from which the present in-
flated prosperity springs—the land and
its population, individual productivity,
personal service, frugality, thrift and
the stability of life which comes only
when a people has faith in the honesty
and sound judgment of its Governments,
no matter which party may be in power.
Virtually all development has been
the product of individualism and of per-
sonal ambition and what is called con-
temptuously by demagogues “the profit
motive,” though generally human achieve-
ment is born not so much of an urge to
accumulate as qf an urge to do and to
create something large and impressive.
The motive to do this is being killed.
Every year there is less incentive for per-
sonal initiative.
Almost all checks • and failures have
come to our prosperity not through the
failures of private enterprise, which in
bulk has never failed and never gone
backwards in the whole of our history,
but when the weight of the Government
hanging round its neck has started to
choke it.
Government, enterprise and Govern-
ment economic policies have now given
Australian expansion a sharp check.
Bankrupt Government railway systems
were “designed” to feed the huge cities
from which dominant political parties
draw their power. The voter has be-
come politically more important than
the producer. Government systems
of taxation and restriction have killed
the incentive to produce in large sections
of the community. They have also ended
in the basic alteration of the theory of
rewards, so that it is no longer the pro-
ducer of real wealth who is the apparent
core of the country’s economy, care-
fully nurtured by Governments, but the
purveyor of luxuries —betting, beer, etc. —
to large aggregations of population in the
overgrown cities.
Australia could very well begin its New
Year with a little silent meditation on
hard facts.
The first of these to be considered is
the tremendous importance to every
citizen of our rural industries. The second
is, that in this supposedly unexampled
period of prosperity, when the mob has
only to ask to receive, there is, for the
first time, a natural and regular decline
both in the sources of real wealth and in
♦he numbers of people engaged in pro-
ducing it.
Over large areas the soil is being de-
stroyed by erosion, stock are declining in
numbers, improvements and cultivation
are being limited and with them the ex-
ports from which we draw our external
income. There are 7,000,000 fewer sheep
in the Commonwealth than there were in
1938-39, 200,000 fewer dairy cattle,
550,000 fewer horses and, even if there is
an increase in beef cattle, production of
beef has remained relatively stagnant and
the export hide trade has shrunk.
What is happening is emphasised by the
continual drift of population to the big
cities. It has reached a stage which
frightens even such spendthrift optimists
as Mr. Dedman, who said, the day be-
fore Christmas Eve, that it was “very
serious,” as anybody who has watched
the position could have told him years
ago. Said Mr. Dedman:
In almost every State rural population
has declined. The only significant growth
in population in New South Wales has
been in the industrial regions of Newcastle
and the Illawarra In the Lachlan region
of New South Wales the population has
dropped by more than 14,000 in 14 years,
equal to an outward migration of more than
2000 people a year when the natural popu-
lation increase is taken into account.
His remedies lie in the distribution of
secondary industries, which —of vast im-
portance though they are —depend ulti-
mately for their existence, whether they
are sited at Sydney or Thargomindah.
upon what the soil gives up.
Instead of using the period of apparent
“prosperity” through which we are pass-
ing to lighten the weight of debt which
sits on the shoulders of the country and
to take the huge burden of taxation off
production and commerce in general,
we are actually increasing the national
debt and drawing on our fat to
finance more and more harebrained, half-
Communist schemes for electoral-bribery
purposes at a time when our real re-
sources and real wealth, in terms of
production per head, are steadily declin-
ing.
Mr. Chifley is still preaching the im-
minence of the Golden Age. But it needs
only a 25 per cent, fall in overseas prices
to turn his gold into galena and bring
him and his followers down to earth —and
grass.
Almost all the advances by this country
have been the product of private enter-
prise because private enterprise is the only
system which makes the promoter of it
squarely responsible for success or failure,
which punishes him if he falls down on
the job and rewards hard work, efficiency
and foresight. Government enterprise
generally fails because these elements do
not affect it. When its schemes crash it
simply grabs some more of the taxpayers’
money to put the balance right. It cannot
be brought to account under the present
loose financial system which has grown
up under “Labor” rule and under which
the Auditor-General’s and public criti-
cism are ignored until it shocks the whole
country by the ruin it has created.
That final state of affairs may have to
be faced by Canberra “Labor” at the first
sign of a world becoming unwilling to
pay starvation prices for its food require-
ments and present high rates for wool.
Curtains for U.N.O.
Despite Dr. Evatt’s spurious pretences,
the death-knell of the “United” Nations
as we have known it is ringing in both
Britain and the United States. Respon-
sible newspapers in those countries see no
further use for it in either the settlement
of the late war’s problems or the securing
of permanent peace for mankind. In
Britain leaders of both political parties
are agreed that U.N. debates have, in the
Socialist Attorney-General’s words, “only
increased, not diminished, the tension be-
tween East and West,” that its proceed-
ings are provocative, expensive and
dangerous, and that, as *Duff Cooper
says, “its influence on international rela-
tions is malign.”
Twelve months ago a shrewd observer
writing in the Chatham House monthly
review, The World Today, warned the
Atlantic democracies of the real purpose
behind Soviet Russia’s revival of the
older Comintern in the “Cominform.” It
was the coping-stone on the Red Army’s
seizure of the central European countries
from the Baltic to the eastern Medi-
terranean, including some of those previ-
ously enslaved by Hitler.
The Soviet Union was not prepared to
leave to an international conference or
authority the settlement of affairs in the
countries on its frontiers... .Long before
the charter of the United Nations was
drafted the Soviet leaders steadily set about
extending their security belt ana the scope
of their area of economic control.... [With]
aims bound to arouse the suspicion and
hostility of other Powers the Soviet
Union calculated that it would find itself
in a minority on the Security Council.
From 1944 onwards, therefore, it has been
Moscow’s policy to use the “United”
Nations as a public stage or forum for
opposing every move of the Western
Powers to restore Europe, since Moscow
regards an economically healthy Europe
as immune to Communism. The Soviet
foresaw that sooner or later the “United”
Nations must collapse under this treat-
ment, as Moscow intended that it should.
As early as the formative San Francisco
conference in June, 1945, Gromyko re-
vealed the Soviet’s preparations for dis-
cord. He said:
In the opinion of the Soviet delegation
one cannot condemn beforehand the motives
which may compel a State to use its right
to leave the organisation. The right is the
expression of State sovereignty.
And so, in preparation for the final
act of expulsion or voluntary withdrawal,
Moscow in 1947 created, or re-created,
the “Cominform,” as a substitute for
U.N.O. in Soviet-ruled Eastern Europe.
It is quite ridiculous to suppose that
the men who have represented British,
American and French Governments ort
the Foreign Ministers’ Council, on the
“Security” Council and in the U.N.
Assembly, for the past two years at least,
have been blind to the truth that Russian
U.N. policy has been one of settled and
unalterable malignancy. Because the
Western peoples could be educated to the
truth only gradually and by visible evi-
dence of this Soviet perfidy, their leaders
have had to allow time to be wasted in
futile “efforts” to come to terms with the
Soviet.
Dr. Evatt does the world, and Aus-
tralia especially, gross disservice by pre-
tending that his personally-gratifying but
temporary presidency of U.N. Assembly
can rectify this betrayal, can turn into
gold this lump of dross. “This deadlock,”
he tells the world, as though he were
addressing merely some Canberra Caucus
meeting:
This deadlock in the problems of the
major nations cannot be allowed to block
U.N.O.’s work, to underestimate its many
achievements, and to stifle its certain
growth The people of the world are
behind U.N.0., which could, and would,
stop a third world war.
“The people of the world” are not so
dumb.
From the American press a chorus of
condemnation of the late session in
Paris greets U.N.O.’s preparations to re-
move its huge and useless machinery back
to its transatlantic circus-ground at Lake
Success. Among the British press, even
the “Times,” as is noted in “Uncabled
Additions,” is unable to keep up the farce
of pretending that U.N.O. is anything but
a school for diplomatic scandal and
vituperation, and the “Spectator,” which
has long been trying to make fair-minded
allowances for the Russian temper, de-
clares with finality:
Russia’s strategy is methodical and de-
liberate. She stultifies the United Nations
because she wants to stultify it. The United
Nations, stands for order, understanding
and prosperity—for everything, in short,
fatal to the spread of Communism, which
battens on disorder, dissension and penury.
It was worth while to display patience to
be satisfied beyond a doubt that Russia’s
frustration of United Nations action was
systematic and permanent. No further
room for doubt remains. Russia’s per-
petual opposition to the United States
and Western European Powers makes it
completely impossible to rely on the United
Nations for the organisation of effective
defence. That situation cannot continue.
Apart from the significance of this
simultaneous and common denunciation
on both sides of the Atlantic, the chief
point made in it must ring a warning bell
in every country, large or small, which
has retrenched its defence services in the
belief that the development of U.N.O.
will make them superfluous. That goes
especially for Australia. Whether, when
he resists this debunking of the “United”
Nations, Dr. Evatt is trying to exalt his
presidential chair, or is merely barrack-
ing for his own Government’s policy of
doing without an army or an air force,
is immaterial in face of the truth, now
forced on us, that we have been living
in a fool’s paradise for long enough.
The end of the first phase of Dr. Evatt’s
U.N.O. presidency .was marked by an
intemperate outburst from Australia s
instructed delegate before the “Security
Council against the Dutch action in Indo-
nesia. That present of vodka recently
sent to Col. Hodgson from behin4 the
Iron Curtain with a message of Vyshin-
sky’s esteem seems to have brought out
all “the larrikin strain” discerned by
Mr. Hasluck in Our Foreign Policy.
How the Moscow strifemongers must
have laughed at the Assembly president’s
offsider’s effort in emulating Vyshinsky’s
diplomatic billingsgate! Its only effect
has been to give the all-clear signal to
the Communist bosses of the wharfies and
seamen in Australia and thus doubly
to discredit Australian “good offices” in
Indonesia.
If the Dutch had felt any uncertainty
about .U.N.O.’s impotence to assure ei\-
forcement of its simplest orders, the
current Palestine example must have re-
solved all doubts. Has U.N.O.’s “cease-
fire” orders in that region elicited any
respect from the Israeli “Government”?
Was the murder by invading Jewish gang-
sters of a U.N.O. arbitrator a minor
offence as compared with the arrest in
Java by the Dutch *of Communist rebels
who had made a jest of “good offices”
for over a twelvemonth? And what has
Dr. Evatt’s instructed deputy had to say
about the defiance of U.N.O. and its
officers in Palestine and Greece? Is it
a mere coincidence that Moscow has been
egging on the fomenters of trouble in
all three regions?
When Dr. Evatt revisits Australia and
condescends to address the House of
Representatives he might be pressed to
answer some of these questions. He
might tell us whether China is still one
of the Big Five with a right to veto de-
cisions on the “Security” Council, and
if so, why ; whether a Communist Gov-
ernment in China will fall heir to that
permanent seat and veto, and whether,
in such event, he still thinks the outlook
for peace and unity is all serene.
There are views held in this country
according to which its Deputy Prime
Minister, responsible also for the
conduct of two highly-important Gov-
ernment departments, ought not to
live on the other side of the
world; that no Australian Minister
for External Affairs ought to run about
doing his own errands in foreign lands
while directing a diplomatic corps created
for that purpose; and that least of all
should he canvass Jiis own election to a
full-time job as president of an organisa-
tion engrossed in what is now a highly
dangerous “cold war.” Dr. Evatt should
be required to satisfy his own country-
men on these points also.
"Butter the -s Up."
A few days before Christmas the annual
conference of the N.S.W. Teachers’
Federation passed a motion of censure
on the Teachers’ Anti-Communist League
on the grounds of its “destructive expres-
sions and activities” and because it sought
to “vilify the executive officers” of the
Federation. Mr. Gibbons, a vice-president
of the League, said that Mr. C. P.
Ryan, a headmaster and a member of the
League, was prepared to make a statutory
declaration that “influential members of
the Federation” had taken him to Marx
House and invited him to join the Com-
munist party. This led Mr. Lewis, presi-
dent of the Federation, to step down
from the chair to enter the debate. He
was reported by two morning papers as
saying “I did not take Ryan to Marx
House. I have never been to Marx House
in my life.”
Next day Lewis denied having used the
second sentence. Several reporters said
he had ; several teachers said he hadn’t;
others agreed with the reporters. Whether
he actually made the remark is not of
prime importance. Fourteen months ago
Mr. J. T. Lang told the Prime Minister
and the House of Representatives that
Lewis, who was then representing Aus-
tralia at a Uifiesco conference in Mexico,
had been a member of the Communist
party since 1932. Lewis has not denied
the charge, and the Prime Minister’s
comment at the time was that “of course,
Communism in Australia is a philosophy
which it is legal to profess.” Taxed at
the Teachers’ conference with being a
Communist, Lewis said “I am not going to
affirm or deny my political affiliations at
a conference of this Federation, v and sug-
gested that the important question to
ask of the executive and council was not
whether they were Communists, but
whether they worked in the interests of
teachers on a democratic basis.
Conference apparently accepted this
argument; anyway, it carried a resolu-
tion condemning the Anti-Communist
League, so it may be assumed that dele-
gates felt that Communist members of
the executive were working “in the
interests of teachers on a * democratic
basis.” Had they had an opportunity of
glancing at a letter which Acting Prime
Minister Nash of New Zealand had read
in the Dominion Parliament' the day


before the Sydney shindy those of them
who were not themselves tinged with one
of the many shades of pink and red might
have felt a little differently on the matter.
Mr. Nash told the House that his Gov-
ernment had been concerned at Com-
munist-party efforts to use the trade-
union movement to further the aims and
objects of Communism, and that a letter
had come into his hands giving specific
proof of such activities in at least one
branch of the Public Service. The letter,
said Mr. Nash, was written by Cecil
Holmes, a member of the Communist
party and an employee of the N.Z.
National Film Unit. It read:
Jack, —
I am calling the stopwork meeting at
the studios for 3.30 p.m. Friday, ostensibly
for half-an-hour, but it will quite easily
drift through to 4.30, which is knock-off
time. You and Griffin and Dick Scott will
be present. The “pulsing-up” will be
entirely over to you. At the end pf it,
a fiery, but on-the-line, resolution will be
passed. In your flow of chatter I suggest
a line like this:
(1) Butter the b rs up a bit remind
them of their previous successful struggle
of a couple of years back, of how they
have even been able to help other groups
in the P.S. because of their strong stand
(viz., the N.Z. 8.5.) and so on. Make them
feel the association looks after them.
(2) Outline the nature of the struggle to
date in general and, I needn’t add, most
forceful terms the emphasis on the
salaries campaign rather than the tribunal,
though this matter is, of course, a large
part of the story, as it leads in to the
(3) attack on the Government....
Most people out here vote Labor, of course,
but they are all anarchists at heart, and
don’t give a hoot in hell for anything in
particular.... but with no exceptions
they heartily hate the Administration. You
can rub it in as hard as you like.
(4) Relate the whole how-do-you-do to
the people you’re talking to....they feel,
and naturally, a bit cut-off from the main
stream of events, but they’re interested, not
unintelligent, and will respond to a strong
lead.
After you’ve wound up, this resolution
will be put and carried (unanimously):
“That we, the workers in the Government
Film Studios: —
“(a) Express the opinion that the Gov-
ernment has broken faith with the Public
Service Association in having put forward
the Government Services Tribunal Bill,
which is quite inadequate, and in fact an
insult to public servants.
“(b) Demand that the findings of the
margins and anomalies committee be im-
plemented forthwith.
“(c) Demand that a general all-round
increase in basic salaries of £35 p.a. be
made and other salaries levelled up accord-
ingly with due regard to margins of skill
and experience.”
This resolution is a bit rough round the
edges, but may be all the better for that.
(Sgd.) Cecil Holmes.
I will arrange for you to be picked up at
3.10 p.m.
Mr. Nash explained that “there could be
no doubt” that the “Jack” to whom the
letter was addressed was Mr. J. P. Lewin,
president of the Public Service Associa-
tion. He [Mr. Nash] had in his possession
draft resolutions in the handwriting of
Mr. Lewin, who had in fact addressed the
stopwork meeting. Mr. Nash read the
resolutions. Whether they were as fiery
as Holmes had desired only he could say,
but they included a statement that the
meeting was being held “in defiance of
the Public Service Commission’s ban,” a
declaration that the Government had
“stabbed us and all other public servants
in the back,” and a reference to “the
Government’s attempt to square off this
treachery.”
The Acting Prime Minister also said:
It is known that ifi addition to writing
the letter Mr. Holmes also sent a number
of telegrams to public servants in various
parts of the country to prompt action on
their part 1 feel that it is of paramount
importance that Communist activities such
as indicated in the above-quoted letter
should be -made known to the whole com-
munity and particularly to those interested
in the welfare of the trade-union movement
so that they may be on their guard against
being made the tools and dupes of persons
working for an ulterior purpose or with a
' sinister motive. The technique is one used
by the Communist party in many parts
of the world.
The technique is certainly used in this
part of the world, and it is time sane and
loyal teachers who form the bulk of the
membership of the N. S. Wales Teachers’
Federation asked themselves whether they
are not being used as “tools and dupes of
persons working for an ulterior purpose.”
“Butter the b rs up a bit,” “Make
them feel the association looks after
them,” “This resolution will be put and
carried (unanimously).” Is this the tech-
nique that is being used on members of
the Teachers’ Federation? Members will
have to answer that question for them-
selves. They will get no such lead or
assistance from “Labor” Governments,
State or Federal, as the New Zealand
Public Service has received from its Gov-
ernment.
Mr. Nash has instructed the Public
Service Commission to carry out a full
investigation. The best that our Prime
Minister can manage is a bleat that Com-
munism is “a philosophy which it is legal
to profess”—it was his Government
which made it legal. The McGirrs and
Baddeleys, as far as the Public Service is
concerned, seem to prefer to ignore the
existence of the “philosophy” altogether.
PLAIN ENGLISH
Prices and Propaganda.
How insistent propaganda, so wide of
the truth as to be deliberate untruth,, can
achieve its object was illustrated last
Wednesday, when an honest article, ex-
plaining the reasons for continuous price-
rises, in the “Sydney Morning Herald”
was prefaced with these words: “Many
people who voted at the referendum to
transfer price-control to the States are
beginning to regret their decision.”
That is the propaganda line of the
Chifley Government and its Communist
supporters. It is untrue, and the truth
needs to be stated every time the claim is
made. The truth is that the referendum
asked the people to vote on a simple
question—whether or not they were in
favor of price-control being a permanent
power of the Federal Government.
The people voted against the notion,
but in their innocence they believed that
the Chifley Government would continue
to exercise the temporary price-control
power it had under war-time regulations.
It was because of pique—the same pique
which caused him to announce nationalis-
ation of the banks after being defeated
in an attempt to force certain bodies to
bank with the Commonwealth Bank —
that Mr. Chifley threw price-control to
the States and withdrew subsidies from
several commodities.
Scarcely any of those who voted on
May 29 last year anticipated the action
“ARISE, SIR DONALD!”
of a narked Socialist Government. As
was here said (B. 24/11 / ’48):
In the light of later (post-referendum)
statistical evidence a “Yes” vote would*
not have stopped the rise. High wages
and shorter hours mean mounting costs of
production and that’s all there is to it
The “No” vote, by giving Mr. Chifley the
chance to shift the responsibility at once
to the States, was something in the nature
of a godsend to Federal “Labor.”
And Federal Labor and its Communist
allies have never stopped sneering both
at the people and the States, as their
propaganda has never stopped insisting
that the people voted for transference of
price-control to the States. They did
nothing of the sort, but the quoted state-
ment from the “S.M.H.” article shows
what propaganda can do and why it must
be resisted when it is based on a false-
hood.
Holloway v. Clarey.
One of the treats promised to employers
and unions this year is a “review of in-
centive systems in Australia and over-
seas” to be prepared by research officers
of the Commonwealth Department of
Labor and National Services. This was
about the last 1948 promise made by Mr.
Holloway, the Minister, who had some-
how made the profound discovery
that it is “an economic fact that employ-
ment creates more employment.”
Mr. Hollo.way, who believes that “full
employment” will be maintained in 1949,
also believes in incentive-payments,
though with qualifications:
In some quarters it has been claimed
that incentive-payments provide the panacea
to all production problems. I don’t be-
lieve they are the complete panacea, but I
will continue to encourage them, provided
proper management-worker relations exist
and there are appropriate safeguards.
Hardly had Mr. Holloway got this
out when there arose a challenger in
the person of Mr. P. J. Clarey, president
of the Australian Council of Trade
Unions, who is of Mr. Holloway’s poli-
tical persuasion—at least, with this ex-
ception :
The incentive-payments system has created
hostility among workers and has not built
morale in industry. It has proved a danger
to the workers’ health, security and personal
relations on the job One objection is
that as soon as a worker begins to earn
relatively big money steps are taken to
reduce the payments on the ground that
he is earning too much.
This sort of poppycock has been dinned
into unionists’ ears for 30 years, but
somehow, deep down in their secret
hearts, most honest workers like piece-
work and bonuses. Mr. Holloway, of
course, is aware that many workers be-
lieve in incentive-payments, so he some-
what negatively supports the notion. Mr.
Clarey is equally aware that most union
bosses don’t like it, so he opposes it.
Thus both sides get their sop.
Mr. Clarey, too, is probably aware of
another possibility. Add to the protec-
tion as to wages, hours and conditions
which the toilers already enjoy through
legislation the added privilege of in-
centive-payments, and before long an un-
comfortable number of toilers would be-
gin to ask themselves why they support
highly-paid union officials and their off-
siders. It might make a cheerful be-
ginning for 1949 to get Messrs. Holloway
and Clarey to debate the subject in
Sydney stadium.
Commos Take a Knock.
When, early in December, the Com-
munists in miners’ lodges on the northern
N.S.W. coalfields demanded a new ballot
for Miners’ Federation executive offices
—they having been defeated by A.L.P.
candidates for the senior positions of
president and vice-president, though
without losing majority control —the
move to upset the election received front-
page notice in the Sydney press.
The Communists’ alibi was that, con-
trary to Federation rules, leaflets had
been distributed on behalf of their
opponents for these offices. The elected
ones should therefore, the Corns con-
tended, be disqualified for having been
served by propaganda in their favor, and
a new ballot was demanded.
By means of local snap-votes among
the lodges—the motion for a new ballot
being proposed at any meeting where
a quick count of heads showed it could
be safely proposed—the agitation to upset
the election was worked up. The Com-
munist majority on the northern board
of management secured passage of a
resolution for a new election as a recom-
mendation for district lodges to vote
upon.
By this means the thing was put to the
lodges’ vote during the last working week
before Christmas. But not a word of
the result was given to the press. The
Communist bosses of the Federation saw
to that.
The reason was that the lodges de-
cisively defeated the Commos’ proposal
by 6525 votes to 3225 ; and so the first
ballot results stand.
Meteor War.
Pretty soon the atomic bombs dropped
on Nagasaki and Hiroshima will be
called weapons of a bow-and-arrow
period. “Earth-satellite-vebdcles” are the
new idea, and aeroplanes will become just
nuisances interrupting observation from
beyond the stratosphere.
U.S. Defence Secretary Forrestal
started this hare by revealing that Ameri-
can fighting services are studying ‘the
possibility of creating military outposts
which will hang like tiny moons far up
in the sky.” Scientists, who forthwith
began expounding to the press in large
numbers, said that these “satellite
vehicles” will not be habitable at first, but
that eventually men will live in them.
“Push-button warfare,” 1949 model, is
something guaranteed to make every-
body sky-minded.
The first stage, according to the new
lunatics (that is to say, propagandists for
domicile in artificial moons), will be the
suspension far above the atmosphere of
man-made meteors with atomic warheads
“ready to plunge to earth to a selected
target at a push of the button in a radar
control-room,” presumably on earth,
whereby will be released the force of
gravity previously somehow placed in
suspension.
The following stage, also the subject of
current “experimentation” (says a Dr.
Harry Ross, of some body called the
British Interplanetary Society), is the
building of “space-stations,” to be placed
(never mind how) somewhere between 500
and 22,000 miles away from the earth,
where “men will live and work,” doing
things like manipulating giant mirrors to
focus the sun’s rays on some enemy
country on earth, and handling other
massive “technical equipment” for bomb-
dropping as the target comes into sight
every 24 hours. When not engaged in
these lethal occupations—on signals from
some push-button artist like (say) Mr.
Chifley smoking his pipe in Canberra —
they will be “watching out for illegal
atomic-bomb factories” and for “prepara-
tions for war anywhere on earth.” Such
objects will, of course, be easily recog-
nisable 22,000 miles off.
When all this comes to pass we may be
treated to the sight of Mr. Chambers and
Mr. Dedman standing on the roof of the
C.S.I.R. headquarters gazing into the
dome of the heavens and reciting to-
gether : “Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How
I wonder what you are?” And meaning it.
A National Disgrace.
A N.S.W. police sergeant, in evidence
against a person charged with theft from
the N.S.W. railways, somewhat casually
mentioned that pillage from those same
railways amounted to about £250,000 a
year. Nobody in the N.SW. railways,
or in the N.S.W. Government which runs
them, seemed to be . concerned about it.
Perhaps a mere quarter of a million is a
bagatelle to a Government which loses
millions of public money on its transport
services.
But other eyes noted the item. A South
Australian paper reported it with a
rather virtuous air of detachment, Vic-
torian papers found a morose consolation
in being able to compare with it Vic-
toria’s £75,000 loss from the same cause,
and Brisbane “Courier-Mail” repeated it
in reporting that Queensland railways
pillage losses ran into £17,000 last year.
The Brisbane figure is bad enough at
nearly £l5OO a month, but it fades into
insignificance against Victoria’s £75,000,
which becomes little more than pin-money
against the shocking N.S.W. total. When
to this are added the pilfering losses in
S.A., W.A. and Tasmania, and the round
estimate of £1 million recently made by
an insurance publication for all Australian
ports, it looks as though a staggering
proportion of the transport community is
“on the pinch.” ,
The responsible authorities do their
best to stop it, but their hand is weakened
by the general union attitude that a
unionist convicted of theft on the job
mustn’t be deprived of either his union
membership or his right to continue in
the employment he has abused —an atti-
tude inferentially supported by Govern-
ments not game to bar railways, ships and
wharves to convicted thieves. The public
generally connives. Few people can
resist buying “lifted” goods, and many
take a pride in boasting of how they
got this or that valuable item “off a
bloke.” • >
Not the least alarming aspect of tne
thing is that it is increasing in a time of
“full employment” and general pros-
perity ; this, and the fact that both con-
signors and consignees now recognise
pillage as an accepted risk, suggests pretty
plainly that modern Australia holds some
peculiar conceptions of honesty.
Indonesia—-the Facts.
What the Soviet and its political agents
in the Indonesian “Republic” wanted to
do was to block the steady recover of
Javanese production during 1948, a
noticeable result of the Dutch energies in
reclaiming east and west Java 12 months
“Age’s” special correspon-
dent in the N.E.I. has been revealing die
extent of this recovery. Exports are be-
ginning noticeably to replenish European
lid American supplies of M.esstapte
and imports are rising aiso. Id Festern

been reopened, but 328 of them had still
to be guarded against “Republican”
guerrilla raids.
Some results, as recorded in exports
last September:
Copra, up to 31,505 tons a month,
compared with 46,000 in 1938 (a specially
good year).
Palm-oil, 2640 tons, “a little more than
the best monthly average in the 10 years
before the war.”
Tea, 1313 tons, about a fifth of pre-war
monthly exports. This figure is to be
doubled this year.
Tin ore, 3263 tons, beating pre-wax
figures; bauxite 67,756 tons; rubber 42,689
tons, equalling 1939 exports.
Ground nuts, tapioca, cinchona bark
(quinine), mineral oils, tobacco —all rising,
though some distance behind pre-war re-
cords.
It. is not remarkable that the Dutch,
having by hard work got so much going
again in these tormented islands, upon
exports from which Britain and all West-
ern Europe are relying for fats, should
have decided that a mob of Communist-
led gangsters were not going to sprag the
wheels again in Java. Even Australia
looks for relief from high tea prices to
a recovery of N.E.I. production. Only
the crowd in office at Canberra —in line,
it seems, with the Communist-bossed
wharftes and seamen who dictate Can-
berra policy —ignore the palpable Aus-
tralian interest in the effort the Dutch
have been making.
Australian housewives will pay more
for tea (through the Federal subsidy) and
will continue to be rationed in their daily
use of it for an indefinitely long period
as a result of this insensate hostility of
the Australian Government against
the Dutch.
Soviet Russia has temporarily outlawed
itself from participation in the N.E.I.
recovery, and so does not care. American
artificial-rubber interests have become
alarmed at the spurt in export of natural
rubber, and that may have influenced the
U.S. attitude at U.N.O. If so, it is stupid
in the extreme and entirely against the
conditions of self-help laid down by
Washington for the European Recovery
Programme.
What annoys the Chifley-Evatt inter-
national table-thumpers is the Dutch ex-
ample of hard work in the cause of
speeding up production undler private
enterprise. Their insolence in attempting
to interfere in the domestic affairs of an-
other country is emphasised by their pre-
tence that world interests are being
assailed not by themselves, but by the
Dutch.
POLITICAL POINTS
Australia, through the mouthpiece of
Our Foreign Policy, has told the world,
“Even with our friends we cannot con-
done the breach of a solemn obligation.”
To prove it there is our action against
our former friends the Dutch in Indo-
nesia, our proposal that they should be
expelled from U.N.O. if they do not obey
a cease-fire order. To disprove it there is
our inaction against our present friends
the Tel Aviv Israelites, who, according
to U.N.O.’s acting mediator, Dr. Bunche,
have deliberately broken the truce by
attacking the Egyptians in the Negeb
area.
• The committee which has been inquir-
ing into Communist activities in the
United States has issued its final report on
the “Trojan Horse” policy of the Com-
rades in Red-anting Government depart-
ments. It states: “If the Communists
succeed, the Constitution will go, and the
free American Republic will be dead.”
Canada has already had its probe into
Communism ; Britain is vetting its Public
Service; New Zealand is also looking
into the subject. Of course, we have no
need to worry about that sort of thing in
Australia. Mr. Chifley and Mr. Dedman
keep too close an eye on things for the
Comrades to menace the country’s security
through the Public Service. Or so they
say.
Ligertwood, J., of the S-A. Supreme
Court, is to be. the Royal Commissioner
to inquire into the New Guinea timber-
lease case. His terms of reference had
not been announced when this went to
the printer, so it is not known whether
the activities of Santa Claus will be in-
cluded in the inquiry. At the conspiracy
trial Dovey, K.C., said of Bill Urquhart’s
career as a punter, “If you can believe
what he swore about his betting trans-
actions, then you can still believe in
Santa Claus.” If it turns out that it was
Santa Claus who recommended Urquhart
for the job of managing-director of
Sydney Pincombe Pty., Ltd,, and that the
same benevolent old gentleman secured
for Pincombes the permit to import Halda
typewriters, it might explain a whole lot
of things.
With better judgment than he showed
when he jumped headlong into the Vic-
torian coalition squabble McEwen,
deputy-leader of the Federal C.P., has
come out with a plan which he claims
would ensure “the full weight and influ-
ence of the Country and Liberal parties
being welded into a single instrument to
be directed against the Socialist party in
the next Federal election.” His idea is
that the two parties should each appoint
“a standing executive available for joint
consultation on the general issues of_anti-
Socialistic policy and for the strategic
planning of elections.” Its* job would be
to choose a joint Senate team and to- avoid
three-cornered fights by deciding which
of the two parties had the better chance
of winning a doubtful seat in the light
of the past history of each electorate. If
McEwen can get his plan adopted he will
have done a good job for both parties,
and for the country.
The Prime Minister, in his first
“report-to-the-nation” broadcast for 1949.
said that Australia could not ignore the
possibility of a recession overseas violently
injuring her own economic structure.
Steady, Mr, Chifley. Any member of
your party could tell you that the last
Depression had nothing to do with over-
seas trends, but was caused solely by the
U.A.P. and the trading banks.
Colonel Hodgson, in Paris, speaking
for Evatt, resting in a luxury suite on the
liner Dominion Monarch;
During the war Australia gave the Dutch
forces and Dutch authorities sanctuary
and helped them in every way to reorganise
their forces for taking over their life in the
N.E.I.
Next thing we’ll be hearing that the U.S.
forces sent here in response to Mr. Curtin’s
“without inhibitions” appeal were given
sanctuary in Australia. Without Dutch
shipping New Guinea could easily have
been lost, and at the war’s end the Chifley
Government’s Refusal to allow Dutch
forces to train in Australia was a big
factor in enabling the clique who col-
laborated with the Japs to become the
Indonesian “Republic.”
Macmahon Ball followed the Evatt
line too conscientiously in Japan; Bert
dumped him. If the wind changes again
Colonel Hodgson may find himself pro-
moted to Minister for Liberia.
% Problem confronting many “Labor”
members in sliced-up Federal electorates:
Whether to plump for the safe end of
their old territory and let some new-
-comer carry the banner to- defeat at
’tother end, or whether to throw the
weight of their prestige as a sitting mem-
ber into the fight for the doubtful chunk
in the hope of winning a new seat for
the party. There is no prize for guessing
how most of them will decide.
Definition of a Communist given in
the “Railway Advocate,” official organ
of the National Union of Railway-
men : “A robot who lives and moves
and has his being by remote control
from Moscow.” The “Advocate” said
it in the course of an article support-
ing the secret ballot and claiming that
“show-of-hands” voting tended towards
the destruction of democracy. All sane
unionists are coming to the same con-
clusion, but political “Labor” still seems
to give more heed to the noisy extremists.
N. S. Wales Land Sales Control posi-
tion as summarised by the president of
the Real Estate Institute: (1) The
approved valuer is required to make his
valuation as at February 10, 1942 ; (2)
the Valuer-General is permitted to make
his as at the present day; (3) for rental
purposes both must make their valuations
as at August 31, 1939. It is possible that
all this seems quite sane and sensible to
the controllers, but if it does it is high
time the lunacy laws were tightened up.
The New Year “Honors” list gives a
pretty indication of how much a nation
is Australia, with its “one flag, one
destiny.” Claude Plowman and Don
Bradman, both sporting coves, would not
have got their handles if they had de-
pended on the “Mother State” which
brought them to prosperity, and of which
Bradman is a native. Not even an
Einstein or an Eisenhower could
aspire to a Sir-hood under N.S.W.
or Queensland “Labor.” And all
rewards for services to the .Com-
monwealth of Australia which cannot
come within the purview of appropriate
States are barred. Thus Australian
generals who held high commands in the
war are out.
That braw Hielan’-man Artie Fadden
turned up at the Warwick (Q.) Cale-
donian Society the other day and, after
disposing of a cairngorm lunch and being
entertained by a tune on the haggis, arose
and said t-he population of this bonnie
land could not be increased by the arrival
of a few thousand immigrants each month
and the coddling of old people with free
medicine and social-service handouts.
“The population has’ become senile,” he
declared. The mon’s richt; so have its
politicians and politics.
A motion set down for the A.W.U. con-
vention in Melbourne this month demands

A lot of Feminists are fond of de-
claring that if women made the laws
there’d be no more wars and everything
would be a lot better. Well, somebody
has taken the trouble to count up women
Parliamentarians in Europe, Latin
America and the Far East and made it
685. U.S.A. has nine, Britain-21, Aus-
tralia’s seven Parliaments about half a
dozen. Their effect is obvious. Things
get no better faster.
Victorian Country-party leader Mc-
Donald continues to claim his organisa-
tion is all one happy family ; Melbourne
“Argus” is equally certain it is not. The
old paper with the New Look claims that
a C.P. district councillor confided to it:
Owing to Mr. McDonald’s continued
propping-up of Sir Albert Dunstan, there
is a growing feeling in the party that Mr.
McDonald should be replaced as leader by
Mr. Dodgshun.
In his time Dunstan has been propped
up by many men, some better than Mc-
Donald, some worse. Most of them have
lived to regret it.
Britain’s Home Secretary Chuter Ede
seems to have what most “Labor”
Ministers lack—a sense of humor. When
A. P. Herbert complained that there were
no pianos in the State-controlled hotels at
Carlisle Ede replied that there were, and
that if Sir Alan cared to oblige “with a
tenor solo from one of his own inimitable
works he would find his entertainment
greatly appreciated.” Of the playing of
darts in public-houses the Home Secre-
tary said: “Darts is not only a game of
skill; it is the one way I know of teach-
ing higher mathematics to the prole-
tariat.” He wasn’t quite right there.
Working out the dividend on an each-
way bet on a horse that runs second at
five-to-four on is a pretty good exercise.
“Only opencut production of coal has
offset the decline in underground pro-
duction and enabled the more urgent
needs of the community to be met,” said
Chifley a few weeks ago. Figures pub-
lished in Christmas week showed the
year’s yield in N.S.W. as 10,276,000 tons
from the mines (third-lowest in 10 years),
1,242,000 from opencut workings.
Losses from strikes in the mines were
2,027,000 tons, or nearly twice as much
as opencut workings contributed. How
“the more urgent needs of the commu-
nity” were met is illustrated by these
figures: the steel industry received 74
per cent, of its requirements, N.S.W. rail-
ways 81 per cent., and Victorian needs
68 per cent. S.A. was probably still
worse served. Miners are due to open
their 1949 year on January 17.
In passing a suspended sentence of
six months on a man who had posed as
a N. S. Wales Government building in-
spector and demanded £6O from a con-
tractor, Mr. Bryant, S.M., remarked:
Somebody higher up in the department
was obviously prompting this man, who had
a good character and a good record. The
case calls for an immediate internal and
drastic inquiry into the workings of the de-
partment of Building Materials as to how
this man was allowed to operate as a
dummy for the department with what was
apparently an authorised document.
How far, if at all, the magistrate’s sus-
picions were justified remains to be seen,
but it is becoming clearer every day that
here, as in Britain, the field of controls
and restrictions is a happy hunting-
ground for blackmarketeers and a fertile
soil for graft and corruption.
Montreal ‘‘Star,” commenting on the
blocking of the John Henry Austral
broadcasts by Federal “Labor,” referred
to the ban on dramatised political
matters as “a stupid form, of oppres-
sion of opinion,” and recalled that
Canada’s Liberal Government imposed a
similar ban years ago when the Con-
servative Opposition introduced drama-
tised broadcasts. If there had been any
sense in the noddle of Senator Donald
Cameron he would have seized upon the
Canadian precedent as justification for
“Labor’s” new measure. Instead he
hastened to point out that the Austral
broadcasts were being banned because of
“deliberate misrepresentation, quite a
different thing from dramatisation.”
Then why the deuce does the Act ban
dramatisation?
The old year closed with Queensland
C.P. bleakly studying a Q.P.P. proposal
that the Liberals should have an opejh
go in nine of the 18 new Federal seats,
the C.P. an open go in seven, Herbert to
have a joint Lib.-C.P. candidate and
Fisher to have one of each.. The C.P.
has till Jan. 5 to agree. The C.P. is
unlikely to want that long; its view is
nine C.P., eight Liberal and one (Her-
bert) joint.
In a confidential moment Mr. Chifley
told Parliament that he and Mr. Curtin
had years ago agreed that “It was no use
talking about ‘new orders’ if after the war
the people were to find themselves back
where they were before.” So he’s deter-
mined to put a lot of them further back
still.
On the word of Tourist Activities
Minister Matthews, N.S.W- is about to
acquire a grand new department. He
proposes to declare certain areas “tourist
areas” and to grade the pubs therein
according to their “standards of accom-
modation.” It ought to be mighty in-
teresting when the flocks of grading-in-
spectors invade the pubs to test their
“standards.”


THE HAUNTED PUB.
“Seeking momentary escape from the political headaches awaiting him, Mr. Chifley is holidaying at a quiet hotel in Tasmania.”
“Time, Mr. Chifley—please!”

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Diam”: During a gale which swept
Melbourne suburbs a few days before
Christmas a strange phenomenon was
observable in the sky which was at fifSt
interpreted as a flying-saucer. It turned
out to be a goose which had apparently
been lifted out of a backyard. Hundreds
of mouths Watered as the valuable bird,
looking as fat as butter, fought a losing
battle against the elements in a noble
desire, no doubt, to get back to its owner
in time for his Christmas-dinner. Losing
ground every minute and at an immense
height, it finally disappeared backwards
in the distance.
* * * *
“V’cluse”: An indignant tram-traveller
on a Sydney eastern-suburbs run asked
the conductor why the dashed thing was
now taking 10 minutes longer to do the
trip. “Well, I don’t know,” confessed the
conductor with a grin, “unless that now
the fares are up the department reckons
you ought to get a longer ride for your
money.” He could be right.
* * * *
“Spasebo”: According to Reuter, com-
posers from all parts of the Soviet are
meeting in Moscow to consider how
Soviet music, recently criticised by the
Communist party, can be brought more
in touch with the “Socialist reality.” Like
a good satellite, Bulgaria also announces
an approaching cultural and scientific
purge in the struggle against “aestheticism,
formalism, individualism and decadent
influences in poetry, painting, literature
and the films.” Generally speaking com-
posers aren’t renowned for thinking, but
if the Soviet musicians had a sense of
humor they could easily confound their
critics. There is no such thing as
bourgeois art and Socialist art —there is
only good art and bad art. A picture or
a piece of music is a statement about
something, and it is either a true or a false
statement. Its truth or falsity does not
depend on whether it was executed in the
reign of Mr. Chifley or Mr. Stalin or Mr.
Churchill. The Communist argument
could be extended to mathematics; why
don’t they declare that the statement that
two and two make four is bourgeois and
counter-revolutionary? There are many
arguments the Soviet composers could
use, but I don’t suppose they will; they
will just do a crawl to the party.

“B. A. Ker”: A recent broadcast from
Goulburn jail produced the customary
appropriate sentimentalities and set me
wondering on the sincerity of the singers.
“Beyond the Blue Horizon,” “Parted” —
yes, a man in jail could sing them and
mean it. But surely “Bless This House”
wasn’t unconscious humor? It reminded
me of the time when I was working at a
reformatory for girls. A lass about to
leave after completing her sentence was
invariably surrounded by her friends,
and, with a great show of affection,
sung” “Now Is the Hour When We
Must Say Good-bye.” The opening line
was appropriate enough, but the last sen-
tence, rendered with great gusto, never
appeared to strike the farewelled or
farewellers as ominous, satirical or even
humorous. As a matter of fact they
very often did return —unless they had
grown old enough to qualify for “The
Bay.”

“Waddlin’ Willie”: The sword carried
by the late Lieut.-General Jess through
all his campaigns is now a treasured pos-
session of Melbourne Grammar cadets.
The general’s family has presented the
sword to the school in memory of his
son, Lieut. Carl Jess, Junior, who was
killed at Tobruk. Awarded annually to
the best all-round cadet, its possession
Will be a coveted honor.

“Pitt St.”: ’Twas a busy city inter-
section, with traffic at its peak. How the
van-driver offended I don’t know, but
the traffic cop whistled, signalled him
into the kerb, then strode majestically
over to him. They entered into some
debate or other, with an examination of
licence papers and so forth. Meantime
on the intersection, deprived of its
authority, a first-class traffic-jam built
up, not helped by smart drivers twisting
and thrusting and daring others. Tempers
were frayed, and back along the four
arteries the traffic stream banked. Then
a sergeant of police materialised, glanced
at the cop and van-driver still in debate,
and took charge of the traffic. It took
him three or four minutes to sort it out —
“Maggie had the right idea; I think I'LL leave home, too."
in all, at least 12 minutes had passed.
This sort of thing occurs repeatedly in
Sydney. Oughtn’t it to be sufficient for
the traffic cop merely to halt the alleged
offender, record his number without
moving from his stand, and take the
thing up later? The present method is
something like a fireman leaving an in-
cipient fire to go and argue with one
already out.

“M 8”: The last N.S.W. State lottery
for 1948 was drawn on the last day of
the year. For most of December there
was a lottery a day. The State gambling
joint says its net profit for 1948 was the
record figure of just on £2,000,000, gross
receipts being £5,660,000 and prizemoney
paid out £3,607,300. Heaven knows
what all Australia pays for this legalised
gambling, as there are three State and one
semi-State lotteries and sundry more or
less continuous “art unions” ; but a safe
estimate would be £2 a head for every
man, woman and child in the country.
In N.S.W. the profits are supposed to
support the hospitals, which manage to
defy the lotteries and go on being under-
staffed, underequipped and tottering to
decay. Meantime every worth-while
charity is wilting, and people trying to
obtain funds for worthy objects are
forced to run their own lotteries on the
sly, the public having been thoroughly
degraded into expecting a quid pro quo
for every deener it once freely donated
in the pure spirit of giving. What will
be the long-term effect on the community
—eh? Is that all we got in the Christmas
Special? A lousy tenner! Aw, well,
keep a fiver and send the rest for tickets
in the New Year Special.

“Noonamah”: Some minor countries
pick up revenue from postage-stamps
printed for philatelists rather than for
postal use. It isn’t the need for a few
extra chips that causes America to put
out a continuous stream of fresh issues,
but there are stamp-collectors in every
country, and if they can’t read English
they can read pictures. Uncle Sam is
telling his story to an international audi-
ence and is getting well paid for it. Most
countries follow his lead to some extent,
but Britain has yet to tell her proud
history per medium of stamps.
Dante and Goethe have appeared on
stamps, but not Shakspeare or Milton;
famous scientists, but not Newton or
Faraday; many fighting men, but not
Nelson or Wellington. Captain Cook,
through Australasian action, has better
publicity than any other notable Briton.
Raleigh and his son are shown on a
British Guiana stamp, Nelson’s Victory
on one of Antigua and Stevenson’s home
and tomb on two Samoan stamps. Un-
fortunately all appear on fairly-high-value
stamps, and are not likely to be found
in the average collection. United States
stamps present the likenesses of over 100
historical characters, including all Presi-
dents to Franklin Roosevelt, most of them
on low-value issues.

“X.S.”: The old plea that he didn’t
know his first wife existed when he
married the second one has succeeded
in a bigamy case in Melbourne. An
Adelaide man who had married in 1940
had reached a state almost of separation
when he went on active service. His wife
had told him that if he provided the evi-
dence she. would give him a divorce, and,
on the advice of an Army legal officer,
he then drew up admissions of adultery
with an unknown woman. Later he
accepted the say-so of another Army legal
officer that he didn’t have to attend the
Court and that the divorce would go
through automatically. Believing himself
a free man he married again in 1944, only
to learn later that his legal wife had
dropped the proceedings because of the
cost. A writ of the South Australian
Supreme Court satisfied Justice O’Bryan
that it was a genuine misapprehension.

“Pongo”: How old is the oldest “work-
ing” beer-bottle? Among a half-dozen
captured by me last week was a decrepit
old beerskin whose bottom was branded
1926. I had never before noticed that
beer-bottles were dated. Its scratched
and battle-scarred appearance suggested
that it has been in constant uSe all its life.
So often has it rubbed shoulders with
its fellows that the glaze on the raised
lettering proclaiming it to be “The
property of So-and-So” has disappeared,
and the words stand out in ground-glass
relief. It stands before me as I write,
positively leering. I’ll swear the damned
old rogue knows it is being kept for
an occasion, that Mum counts it and its
fellows every day, and that I haven’t got
the guts to crack it. But I’ll get the cow
later.

“Jaypey”: Eye-witnesses of the action
in which Prince of Wales and Repulse
were lost did not record “the unexpected
chivalry of Jap pilots who dipped in
salute over their enemies struggling in the
water” (B. 15/12/’4B). When the flag-
ship sank all Nip attack-aircraft had de-
parted, and as the last attack was carried
out by high-level bombers who winged
their way homeward as soon as they
dropped their loads it is difficult to see
how the rumor started. Still, I must
admit that all three destroyers carrying
survivors were greeted by the tale on
their arrival in Singapore—an example of
the unconfirmed stories and rumors fly-
ing round at that time which were
accepted as the truth. While “Macnell”
was on the job I regret he did not
publish in toto the letter written to
C.-in-C. Eastern Fleet by Flight-
Lieutenant Vigors, R.A.F., the Buffalo-
leader who stood by during rescue
operations. This indeed was a tribute
from another service that Would make a
fitting epitaph for those who lost their
lives.

“C.Q.”: Some recent awards in work-
men’s-compensation cases in Melbourne
have aroused comment, yet they weren't
as remarkable as a 1932 example. An
undertaker’s widow claimed on the ground
that an act of reverence had caused the
death of her husband. On a typical Mel-
bourne summer day he had stood un-
covered in the rain by the graveside, con-
tracted pneumonia and died. The Court
held that the deceased had died as a re-
sult of injuries received through the
nature of his employment, ordinary men,
working in the rain, being able to keep
their hats on. She was awarded £6BO.

“Uramao”: The niceties of Parlia-
mentary expression are jealously guarded
in New Zealand. Recently an Opposition
member mentioned the appointment
of an undischarged bankrupt. to a post
in England in connection with M.L.’s
emigration scheme. “It savored of graft,”
he said. Up rose a Government member
in protest. Mr. Speaker ruled the expres-
sion unparliamentary, and asked the hon.
member to withdraw. He did so, sub-
stituting “It was a piece of arrant political
jobbery.” Mr. Speaker was satisfied, the
House breathed freshly again, and the
debate was resumed.

“Vicar”: Hansom-cabs? Old Ben is
retired now, but he drove hansoms
and four-wheelers in the days when they
used to ply across the Perth Causeway to
the racecourse. On the return the cabbies
would race their horses and cabs for a
sweepstake of the passengers inside, first
back to the Causeway pub. “Funniest
race was when I got squiffy at the races
and fell out of the boot about a quarter
of a mile from the course,” he told me.
“The horse bolted and went on and won.
pulling up just, outside the pub-door.
When the passengers got out to congratu-
late me on winning they found the boot
empty ; I came along in the cab that ran
last.”

“Minto”: I asked a textile manufac-
turer why his company no longer made
the boast “Sold in 81 countries of the
world.” “We’ve thought about it,” he
replied. “The best we can claim now is
‘Still sold in 70 countries.’ Pull back the
curtain and ask Joe about the rest.”

“Mad Hatter”: Tasmania possessed
other factories* besides felt-hatteries in
the early days. Starch was made in
Hobart in 1821, Colonial oil-cloth by
1827 ; glue and parchment, 1828 ; there
was an export trade to Sydney in these
products. Printers’ ink, made by Andrew
Bent in 1829, also was exported to
Sydney. Other industries of early nine-
teenth century included soap, candles,
pottery, leather, shoemaking, salt (from
the salt-pans, near Richmond), dyeing,
brewing, distilling, tanning, ropemaking,
tobacco-manufacture and coachbuilding.
Beet-sugar was manufactured in Mac-
quarie-street, Hobart, in 1835.

“Helldud”: Few famous comedians
could maintain their reputations as funny
men were it not for the assistance of
gag writers, but I regret to report having
come across evidence that politicians also
crib. A “Readers’ Digest” tells the fol-
lowing :
Lady Nancy Astor, who is noted for her
sharp tongue, once got annoyed at
Churchill. “Winston,” she said sharply,
“if you were my husband I’d put poison
in your coffee.”
“Nancy,” replied Churchill, “if I were
your husband I’d drink that coffee.”
The story was told of George Reid and
a woman interjector about 50 years ago.
Now I’m wondering whether George was
in cahoots with the interjector,

“Uco”: “White Christmas!” said the
shirt-sleeved Yank in the hamburger joint
as the radio assailed our ears with Bing’s
rendition of the popular song. “Lissen,
I’ve had their white Christmas. It’s all
right on the Christmas-cards —snowflakes
fluttering down and all that sort of bunk,
but what does it amount to? Y’ have to
climb out the window and shovel the
snow away before y’ can walk out y’r
front door. If y’ don’t it comes sloshing
in under y’r door when it melts. And the
mud and slush everywhere when it does
melt! Robins on the window-sill? What
about the chickens frozen in the fowl-
house? Sleighbells tinkling in the snow!
Let ’em tinkle. Ever heard the honking
of horns of automobiles bogged down
in the snow? Ever had to clean out a
car that’s been snowed-under? White
Christmas! Peep out y’r window at the
snow piled high in y’r front garden, then
switch on the central heating to get warm.
Y’ can have y’r White Christmas. I’ll
settle for a warm one,”

“The voices of C»sar, Napoleon, Genghis Khan,
George Washington and Pontius Pilate are never

kings, heroes and villains of the recent past will

— V.S. “Time."
A somewiat apt and apposite reflection
About this world of ours, so new and brave,
Showing that we’ve advanced in one direction
To which our rude forefathers never gave
A thought, what you may style the resurrection
Of human voices from beyond the grave
Keeping the very accents and the tones
Of those whose frames are now but coffined
bones.
They knew, and often quoted to his credit,
The words some idol of their time had said,
Speeches for friendly newspapers to edit
About the message from his lips that spread.
But none could reproduce the way he said it,
You’ll note, when once the orator was dead,
Recapture or restore the charm that hung
Upon the music of a silver tongue.
Who wouldn’t thrill to hear the voice of Boney
Or Caesar, and a lot of other chaps,
Spruiking their immemorial boloney
Just as it came verbatim from their traps,
Or quite as clear, as if upon the ’phone he
Was calling, that of Washington perhaps,
Or any other celebrated man
From Pontius Pilate up to Genghis Khan?
All gone! The very sounds they yelled or
muttered
Have vanished with their makers up the flue.
But now the stirring words that Churchill uttered
About how much so many owed so few,
Along with all the curses Hitler spluttered
And Goebbels echoed, Mussolini too,
Have been preserved, it would appear, to hand
Down to oncoming generations, canned.
Posterity from now, I see it stated,
Whene’er it likes will only need to shove
A record on, to hear reiterated
The very words MacArthur used above
Surrendering Japs, or Ed when he vacated
A throne and Crown for overmastering love.
Luckier than us, our sons will, so to phrase it,
Know what a man may say and how he says it.

“Tummas McN.”: At last I’m oil
common ground with a Red. He’s
Colonel Vladimir Kotko, and in a letter
to a Moscow paper he attacks the tipping
habit as’a “pre-revolutionary institution”
and refers to its “indignities and servili-
ties.” These, as anyone knows, cut both
ways; the tipper feels that he’s being
got at and the tipped puts on a smirk
that is supposed to represent gratitude
and respect, though it represents some-
thing else. Anyhow, as a private citizen
I’m with the colonel, and I propose to
bring his strictures under the notice of
the Hotel, Restaurant and Caterers’ Em-
ployees’ Union, which, I’m told, is
Commo-run, and also the Australian
Railways Union or, more specifically, its
Melbourne Commissar, Comrade Brown.
These two unions probably have more
tip-takers in their ranks than any other
organisation in Australia, unless it’s the
marine stewards.
“Findy”: Isn*t “F.S.” (B. 29/12/’4B)
getting news mixed up with history or
something else? The essence of news
is that it deals with current happenings;
their importance to posterity is no mea-
sure of their present interest. Of course
the happenings of 1948 will not be «news
in 2048. No one said they would be.
“F.S.” suggests that a hundred! years
hence Gandhi’s assassination may be the
big news of 1948. If it is remembered
it will be history ; it will not be news any
more than Queen Anne’s death is to the
present generation. Next century the
discovery of a previously uncatalogued
loin-cloth belonging to the Indian leader
might be news. I afn afraid it would be,
as I think “F.S.” will agree with me that
there are few signs that the sense of pro-
portion in news values will be any better
developed then than now.

“Zake”: The airways seem to be
caught up in the alphabetical multiplica-
tion which has given this long-suffering
world U.N.0., U.N.E.5.C.0., E.C.A.F.E.
and other monstrosities. I am implored
to fly with 8.0.A.C., to wing my way
with 8.C.P.A., to enjoy the comfort of
T.E.A.L., to hit the sky with Q.E.A.,
T.A.A., A.N.A., and others. This high-
speed world taxes the memory enough
as it is without the complication of slabs
of initials. How better it would be for
the plain people if the plane people
Were to give their concerns a name as
the shipping companies do. You travel
by Oripnt, Cunard, Union, White Star
or other lines, and when it has to be
initials for brevity’s sake the “P. and
O.” sounds like a word.
* * * *
“Bo”: I always considered that as the
ultimate in futility a U.N.O. resolution
was so far ahead of other “possibles”
that its pre-eminence was unchal-
lengeable ; but I reckoned without
the annual “naming of the world's
ten best-dressed women,” emanating, of
course, from the U.S.A. Most of those
named could spend 500 dollars a day on
clothes, and the probability is that they
leave the selection of styles and material
entirely to their dressmakers, milliners,
etc. Admittedly two women could each
wear a small fortune on their backs, yet
one might look a queen and the other
the wife of a dog-trainer. But my
observation has been that the best-dressed
women —by which is meant the most
tastefully dressed —have been those on
modest incomes. Most of all, the ability
to wear clothes is certainly a more im-
portant aspect than mere expensiveness.
Stand in George-street or Collins-street
any lunch-hour and you’ll see girls, in
clothes they either made themselves or
bought in a shop, who w,ear them as
might a goddess, if 'goddesses wore
clothes. In contrast to this list the ten
best-dressed men were named, but these
were not nearly so prominent. Which
is not strange. Name ten of the world’s
most famous men and you could say that
at least eight would be among the world’s
worst dressers.

“Tackline S.”: I once tried nude
mixed-bathing. On my first visit to a
small Black Sea port, being young enough
“Hit it, don't pat it!”
to appreciate the symmetry of feminine
lines allied to birthday suits, I was not
reluctant to join a mixed crowd swimming
in the altogether. This was in the early
1920’5, and I took the practice to be a
healthy outcome of the then new ideo-
logy, though I was rather puzzled at
the blasts of police whistles which
heralded mass-entry into the briny. The
ship’s agent explained matters. The daily
swim in the aptly-named sea was not in-
tended for enjoyment; it was a compul-
sory ablution for those bathless sons
and daughters of the revolution.

“Spokeshave”: A Scottish baronetcy
which had provisionally been accepted by
Debrett’s as going to William Baden
Powell Hay, a Northcote (Vic.) grocer, is
now being contested by a Canadian
Quaker, Conran Hay, a New Zealand
claimant, Robert Hamilton Hay having
vacated the field. The Quaker asserts
that an ancestor of his died before com-
pleting a legal action in support of his
claim to the baronetcy. The Quaker is
in the more equivocal position. As. a
Quaker he believes in the equality of
man, eschews titles, refuses to take oaths
or to bow the knee to orthodox authority
and is obliged to exclude all, gewgaws and
“ That's what happens to girls who leave home!”
dress plainly. The Northcote baronet still
prefers to be called plain Mr. Hay and
continues to serve sugar over his counter.
No estates or money go with the title, but
he has gained an indirect advantage—his
custom has nearly doubled.

“Ebrius”: Dress reform for men may
be a wonderful ideal, but it is a painful
business trying to make it reality, I once
armed myself with a complete new out-
fit selected with the meticulous eye of a
;§elf-styled connoisseur. The long-awaited
hot day arrived, and I donned my linen
suit, two-toned shoes and panama hat.
As each portion of my livery climbed
into place on my frame the early ardor
began to wane and doubts as to my ulti-
mate reception crept in. Sneaking out
the back door and slinking past the
neighbors, I eventually reached virgin
territory. Here I paraded in all my glory.
The wolf-calls of the boys, sly giggles
from the girls, and unabashed stares of
passers-by pierced the chink in my armor.
I slowed down, wavered and fled for
cover, then sorrowfully returned to my
sweat-box outfit to dream again of the
brave new world.

“G. Iris”: Melbourne’s tram v. bus
argument has reached a new stage, with
the taking of one of the queerest refer-
endums ever conceived. The passengers
who use the Bourke-street line were asked
what they thought. The scheme was
called a “surprise secret ballot” and seems
to have been a success in its way. The
Tramways Board claims an overwhelm-
ing vote —at least more than 80 per cent.
—in favor of trams. The ballot-card was
distributed by tramway inspectors and
checkers to passengers in the Buses and
collected a few stops further on. The
chairman of the board said the staff had
been instructed not to influence passengers
in their voting.

“Thad”: To our cemetery went an
order for the digging of a grave. “Who
for?” asked the gravedigger. On being
told the name he said, “Well, I’m not
digging it. I went into his family’s shop
this morning and was refused tobacco.
No tobacco, no grave!” And he meant
it, too. A rush to the town two miles
away, up and down the street went the
messenger in search of the weed, then
back to the cemetery with two tins of
tobacco. The funeral took place.

“L.F.G.”: Tradition has handed down
an interesting story in connection with
the unveiling of Michelangelo’s statue
of David (B. 29/12/’4B). Soderini, Mayor
of Florence, pretended to know some-
thing of art. When the statue was being
placed in position he expressed dissatis-
faction with it, saying the nose was too
long. The sculptor took his chisel and
a little marble dust in his hand and
mounted to the head of the statue. Pre-
tending to work with his chisel he let fall
the powdered marble and came dowm
“Do you like it now?” he asked. “Yes,”
replied Soderini. “You have given it
life.”

“Eureka”: In old Camperdown
(N.S.W.) cemetery I found an old tomb-
stone which should have an interesting
story. For some reason a surname and
either the .word “Assembly” or “Council”
have been neatly cut out of the inscrip-
tion ; the remaining words are very dis-
tinct. The inscription reads: “Sacred to
the memory of Ernestine, Eldest daughter
of Ernest Vicomte De Satge St. Jean,
the beloved wife of Hon. , Member
of the Legislative of Queensland,
who departed this life, 29th October,
1864, at Sydney, Aged 29 years.”

“Unicorn”: “Forty years ago the
country had plenty of poets who could
break into topical verse at a moment’s
notice; there are few today” (B.
1/12/’4B). May the fact not be that
there are versifiers, but that the scope for
their rhymes is so limited they find it
unprofitable to turn out topical stuff?
There were at least four items in today’s
paper, for instance, oh which I’d have
enjoyed turning out some verse with a
topical twist; but where would I find a
market? Many moons ago, when still
a schoolkid, I wrote topical verse for a

“Macnell”: Admiral Farncomb may
take a new broom with him to his new
flagship (B. 29/12/’4B), but in the ward-
room of a certain R.A.N. frigate in
Sydney a rubber was the instrument —
and used fast. On the mess’s nice yellow
lamp-shades the Navy’s two top-rankers,
Farncomb and Collins, had been per-
suaded to inscribe their names. Un-
fortunately, another guest of the mess,
a young lady from a theatrical company,
was smitten with the same bright idea,
and executed it before anyone could
stop her. Now the names of the two
august ones are crowned by a rectangle
of scratched and rubbed smudge, and all
hands are hoping that inspection of ship’s
lighting is not a feature of the next
Admiral’s inspection.

“Becks”: There’s a bloke wandering
loose around Sydney who should have a
great future on the Australian stage. A
Sydney paper sent a man along to have
a look at the queue of applicants for jobs
as supers for the opera season. He
described the scene, mentioned that there
was a sprinkling of Greeks, Italians and
Frenchmen among the triers and added
“Antonio Scarlatti whistled gay airs
from Aida.” The reporter didn’t say
whether Antonio was among the success-
ful applicants, but he certainly deserved
to be. If he can make “airs from Aida”
sound gay there is no saying what he
might do with a really bright show.

“Fleck”: With a feeling of righteous-
ness I approached the hospital pay-office
after returning from sick-leave and
attempted to return the unexpended por-
tion of my subsistence. I explained to the
suspicious private at the desk that I had
returned prematurely. He would have
nothing to do with it, and called the
corporal. Two-stripes, no less surly,
sought the sergeant. The paymaster him-
self was certain that I was on mischief
bent. He was sure the book of rules said
nothing about remitting unexpended sub-
sistence, and he refused to accept it. I
pointed out that I was virtually being
forced into crime, but he would have
none of it. The terrible truth was that
there was no form which I could fill in,
and finally I was turned away more than
half convinced that I had attempted to
commit a criminal offence.

“Curate’s Egg”: During my term at a
Queensland public school the compulsory
wearing of the straw-decker (B.
24/11 / *4B) was abolished. Our pre-
liminary delight at the news was short-
lived, dying with the horrible realisation
that an unfailing means of raising ready
cash had been suddenly wrested from
us. The hats were supplied by the insti-
tution at a cost that was added to our
term bills; they had a prompt, though
half-price, market value at any Brisbane
pawnshop, and the few bob raised on a
hat was enough to provide a day’s gas-
tronomic adventure for impecunious
lads. Wearing of the hats exposed us to
chiacking from boys from other schools,
who considered the headgear namby-
pamby, and fights were of almost daily
occurrence. IVe heard it said that the
old school hasn’t produced an amateur
pug of note since the straw-boat’er was
abolished.
U.N.O. AND EVATT.
"Australia’s role in U.N.O. is merely that of
the band-wagon which Dr. Evatt uses to ride to
world-wide notoriety.” —Letter to “8. M. Herald.”
It plods along whatever are
The paths assigned it sturdily,
Does nothing in particular
And does it very wordily.
Of worth-while deeds it’s few to show,
Of talk a sad satiety,
But don’t forget it’s U.N.Q.
Gives Evatt notoriety.
It’s just a sort of sounding-board
That holds the opportunity
For various nations to record
How far they’re still from unity.
The orders that it can’t enforce
May seem a bit irrational,
But then it’s made the Doc. of course
A figure international.
His fame is on the lips of men
From Latvia and Liberia
To California arid Cayenne,
From Athens to Algeria.
His very name the wide world through
For eminence a brevet is.
In short, from China to Peru,
Few aren’t aware who Evatt is.
So Heav’n forbid we should describe
This body’s doings too gloomily,
Dismiss its powers with a gibe,
Its powwows with contumely.
Although at best it be assessed
A mere debate society,
Against the things it hasn’t done
Put to its credit that it’s won
Doc. Evatt notoriety.

“Ek Dum”: As events pro-
gress, Australian delegates earn
less and less credit in the
Security Council debate on In-
donesian affairs. They are there
on sufferance. Australia is not a
member of the Security Council.
There is not the slightest
chance of the Security Council
doing anything effective. If the
Netherlands has issued a “cease-
fire” order it is only because it
has achieved its purpose. But the
cackle continues and the pattern
of alliances remains the same as
usual —Australia’s violent emis-
saries in the same galley as
Russia’s and speaking in terms
which would be more worthy of
Russia than of a British Com-
monwealth country, though
whether Australia is still a mem-
ber of the British Common-
wealth probably only Dr. Evatt
knows.
He is quite capable of giving
the place away to Pandit Nehru
if there is any limelight to be
gained by the gesture. And if
events of the last few months
mean anything, all the free
i agreement and mutual interest
which are supposed to make for
our association with other
British Commonwealth countries
really brigade us with Moscow.
The Netherlands Minister in
Australia, Dr. Teppema, has
stated the objective of the
Netherlands:
To bring Republican territory un-
der control of the Netherlands mili-
tary apparatus as quickly as possible
in order to create at the earliest pos-
sible moment, through honest and
capable government, a situation of
order, justice and safety in which the
people can express freely and with-
out fear its political desires, and to
supply the necessary care to the
highly-impoverished population. For
this purpose it was essential to occupy
the main centres and larger and
smaller cities in Republican territory,
as the general pacification was to be
achieved from and in close co-
operation with such centres.
He declared that the population
of Java andjSumatra was spon-
taneously coming to the aid of
the Netherlands troops, since the
people in general were utterly
tired of the terror of the Repub-
lican Army and the misrule and
corruption of the Republic.
The Security Council’s order
to the Netherlands to cease fire
was issued on Christmas Eve.
The Netherlands took no
immediate notice of it beyond
giving it “serious consideration”
and directing inquiries to the Re-
publicans in order to try to de-
termine what its attitude might
be if there were a cease-fire.
Meanwhile, Mr. Van Royen,
the Dutch delegate on the Coun-
cil, announced that the opera-
tional phase of the fighting was
nearly over. He said his Gov-
ernment had given instructions
that U.N.O. military observers
should be allowed immediately
to proceed to the front and that
14 Republican leaders in Batavia
had been released.
The bulk of the members of
the Security Council appeared,
so soon as it was evident that
the Dutch had overrun Republi-
can territory, to be prepared to
wait events, even though some
of them were critical.
"ftie Russians and the Aus-
tralians, however, remained on
the offensive, condemning the
Hollanders in insulting language
and demanding extreme mea-
sures, though Colonel Hodgson
did not go all the way in some
channels of attack.
On December 28 Jacob Malik,
the delegate of Moscow, moved
that the Netherlands be ordered
to stop operations within 24
hours, but the only support he
could get outside the Ukraine,
which, of course, acts under his
orders, was that of Syria and
Colombia, the small gringo
nation whose revolutionaries
made such an exhibition of
slaughter and disorder during
the meeting of the American
Peace Congress in Bogota last
year.
Britain, France and Belgium,
all allies in the Western bloc,
refrained from voting and thus
incurred the bitter censure of
Australia’s delegate, who said he
could not understand the British
stand in relation to the U.K.’s
attitude on Palestine. No doubt
the misunderstanding is mutual.
In any case, Colonel Hodgson’s
words supported Malik’s.
The substantive position is
that by December 31 there was
scarcely any firing to cease. Re-
publican losses in 10 days, during
which their Government, capi-
tal and principal cities and nearly
the whole of their realm in two
islands were captured, are esti-
mated at about 300.
The Netherlands Army put its
losses at 41 killed and 99
wounded up to December 28.
It admits the loss of four air-
craft, two of which were shot
down, it alleges, by ack-ack guns
manned by Japanese.
Pressmen who reached Jogja-
karta on December 28 reported
an acute food shortage there,
and that it began before the
Dutch occupation. Under Re-
“ Remember, Prendergast, I have first claim on salvage
publican rule half the popula-
tion of 800,000 had already left
the city and its environs and the
value of the Republican coinage
had become almost as inflated
as the Chinese.
The condition of Republican-
ism seems to be made clear from
the announcements of its own
friends. The Republican Gov-
ernment -itself is mute because
its leaders are in the hands of
the Dutch, who have been in-
structed by the Security Council
to release them forthwith.
Without waiting to hear from
them, the Republican office in
Singapore announced on De-
cember 28 that a Republican
Military Administration had
been set up in Southern Sumatra
headed by the former Deputy
Premier, Dr. A. K. Gani. It is
distinct from an emergency Re-
publican Government set up
separately by Dr. Sjafruddin
Prawiranegara, a former Repub-
lican Economic Minister.
The Communists are, of
course, active throughout South-
east Asia stirring up bad blood.
Their intense interest in the
issue of the fight is shown by
the bitter attitude of the Sydney
“Tribune” and other Australian
Communist journals.
That interest, wittingly or
unwittingly, the Australian dele-
gates at U.N.O. are forwarding
for all they are worth and irre-
spective of considerations of our
own safety.
Colonel Hodgson went from
denunciation to denunciation as
the debate proceeded.
Expressing the fear that the
Indonesian Republic would be
liquidated before the Security
Council acted—it having ad-
journed till January 6 —he said:
Australia during the war gave the
Dutch authorities sanctuary, comfort,
buildings, equipment, supplies and
planes and helped them in every way
to reorganise their forces for taking
over their life in the N.E.I. But even
with our friends we cannot condone
a breach of solemn obligation. We
stand behind the full principles of
U.N.O.
Apart from the fact that this is
the grossest kind of exaggera-
tion, since whatever Australia
did it had to do in its own de-
fence, and that was not very
much, and only part of the pool
assistance which the Allies were
giving each other, the Colonel
seems to have forgotten his his-
tory or he would not have laid
himself open to the kind of
response the Dutch can make.
If we helped the Dutch when
they were driven out of the East
Indies it was largely on the basis
of reciprocal aid as agreed upon
between the Allies.
And, anyway, the Canberra
Government comprised the war’s
greatest bunch of mendicants at
that time.
The Dutch had, before war
broke out, stood wholeheartedly
with us although they knew that
it meant invasion. They gave
us air-landing grounds and every
assistance to establish linkage
with British defences at Singa-
pore. They openly made it clear
to the Japanese where they
would stand in the event of war.
They refused to enter into
arrangements of any kind with
them which would help them.
When General Wavell was
appointed to command the East
Indies area we had 20,000 troops
in North Australia, which was
included in his command, but
15,000 of them were militia. And
although the “Labor” crowd at
Canberra were calling to
President Roosevelt and Mr.
Churchill to send them 25 divi-
sions of conscripts to defend this
country the Allied armies
could not at that stage have
mustered 25 divisions on all
fronts —they refused to allow a
single militiaman to be sent over-
seas to help to hold what seemed
to be imminent invasion of our
own soil.
And the Curtins and the
Chifleys and the Wards, then
in a state of political panic
and military muddle, demanded
that Australian troops who
were in Java under a com-
mander widely at logger-
heads with his sorry masters
should be given preference in
evacuation over everybody, in-
cluding Dutch women and
children.
If the real political facts are
allowed to get into the war his-
tories —which they won’t if the
present Government is in power
when they are published—they
certainly will not cause a surge
of pride in the breasts of Aus-
tralians.

The Ruhr and France.
“Ek Dum”: The decision of
the six-Power conference in
London to continue control of
the Ruhr indefinitely came as a
shock to most observers.
During the heat of the argu-
ment about the Berlin blockade
it had been decided that con-
trol should revert to Western
Germany, which is to be
moulded into a new German
federated State, it being apparent
that Russia will not give up Eas-
tern Germany save to a satellite
Communist Administration with
a constitution which will
make it possible to mortise it
into the U.S.S.R. without undue
trouble when the time came.
Two facts were very clear. No
Western Germany State could
exist without dependence on
other adjacent countries unless
it had the Ruhr, France already
having the Saar in its pocket. A
State of 50,000,000 without coal
and a steel industry of its own
is not much of a State, especially
when it depends on some of the
exports of its coalfields to pro-
vide it with currency to buy raw
materials or manufactures over-
seas.
Also, it was clear, if Russia
were to decide to roll westward
the Ruhr could not be defended,
since the first line at which the
invasion could hope to be
stopped would be the Rhine.
The French attitude is purely
political. France has a Gov-
ernment which is dependent for
its continued existence on being
able to walk the tightrope be-
tween the De Gaullists and the
Communists. No Government
would achieve that feat with the
stigma of having handed the
Ruhr back to Germany on its
shoulders.
The results of the agreement
are what any sensible man would
expect. The Western Germans
are not mad enough to attempt
to establish a Western State
without the Ruhr. If they did
they would be weighed down
with economic difficulties, apart
from the political mishandling
they would be forced to endure.
The problem is a hard nyt to
crack. The orators of U.N.O.
have always frothed at the
mouth over the rights of minori-
ties and of specific populations
to decide their allegiance. The
tale that the Ruhr is to be con-
trolled to prevent its being used
to develop new aggression looks
pretty thin when argued among
Germans whose nation has been
split in halves between East and
West.
It is a German area compris-
ing the heart of the m ew Land
of North Rhine—Westphalia.
The population is German. If
a vote were taken it would be
solidly for adhesion to Germany.
It contains 12 out of the 50 cities
of Greater Germany (outside
Austria) with populations of
125,000 or more. But it is to
remain in the air indefinitely
under foreign control, along
with its 11,000,000 people.
This suits nobody more than
the Communists.
In France they are able to
shout that they have forced the
Government into accepting the
arrangement. In Germany they
feel able to claim that the
British and the United States
have betrayed Western Germany
for French advantage.
Moscow was jubilant about
the whole business. Its cheers
could be heard round the world
on December 30 when the news
came through. The Kremlin ob-
viously felt that it had scored a
triumph.
But the Christian and Social
Democrats of the area, who last
year expelled two Communist
Ministers from their Coalition
Cabinet, are not amused.
Truman and Russia.
“Ek Dum”: There is room for
disquietude in President Tru-
man’s attitude to Russia and to
military defence, which is caus-
ing a good deal of mystification
in circles which study the pro-
ceedings of the U.S.S.R.
At the moment Communism is
pushing itself into every corner
of the globe. Chinese Com-
munists, obviously Russian-
backed, are taking over China.
Communists are doing their level
best with Russian (and Aus-
tralian) help to wreck U.S.
policies in Japan. Communists,
again with Russian backing, are
doing their best to push Ameri-
can influence out of Korea.
The United States Secretary
of State, Mr. Lovett, has just
now found it necessary to make
a vehement protest against the
arrest of Cardinal Mindszenty
in satellite Hungary, where he is
charged with treason, as “sicken-
ing sham.”
Communists have been proved
active in the United States on a
dangerous scale.
Yet President Truman an-
nounces that he believes that
there is an influential element in
the Kremlin which would be
ready to make friends with the
United States.
He has refused to agree to a
Budget of more than
15,000,000,000 dollars for next
year’s military appropriation,
while service heads have been
pressing for 20,000,000,000 and
General Eisenhower is reported
to have been re-enlisted. The
President insisted on cutting the
air groups proposed to 50 from
the existing 59, and the 70
which the defence authorities
had planned to build for opera-
tion in 1952.
The Army he has cut down
from 790,000 to 680,000, allow-
ing for 10 divisions, instead of
12. And the total armed forces
operative this year are to be re-
duced from the 1,900,000 to
1,600,000.
It is to be hoped that Mr.
Truman is not going the same
way as Mr. Roosevelt, wnose
confidence in and yielding to
Stalin’s whims has cost the world
dearly in lives, material and un-
settlement. The bargain regard-
ing the Japanese war, the agree-
ment, against Mr. Churchill’s
advice, to Stalin’s insistence that
the Balkans should not be in-
vaded by the Western Powers
from the Mediterranean, the
arrangement whereby Western
Allied troops were held back so
that Russia might take Berlin
and Prague, were all consum-
mated through the influence of
Mr. Roosevelt.
The results should be a pretty
sound warning to his successor,
who should have learnt this time
that professions of friendship
from sections of a U.S.S.R. Gov-
ernment which has never kept an
agreement or a treaty which it
has suited it to break are about
as solid as wind.
The position is doubly dis-
quieting since President Tru-
man’s statement was followed
immediately by an appeal by his
Secretary for Defence, Mr. For-
restal, for decisive military
action to extend military aid to
Western Europe.
Where Mr. Forrestal’s
thoughts were tending was shown
by his statement that he had
ordered all possible acceleration
in the search for a weapon that
would defeat the threat of the
Schnorkel-equipped, high-speed
submarines which the Russians
are building in considerable
quantities with the aid of Ger-
man information and German
technicians, and the modernisa-
tion of the forces through in-
tegration of the three services.
It is difficult to believe, in the
face of his report, that he shares
the President’s views. Certainly,
very few American officers in
Asia, close to Communist opera-
tions, would feel it safe to take
the same stand as the White
House, especially those who
know the position in Korea.
China Reaches Crisis.
“Ek Dum”: Matters in China
have reached a crisis, though
time there is relatively longer
than in more civilised countries
and the pace of armies is the
pace of the ox.
The Communist forces are
making a leisurely progress
southwards along the main rail-
way from Peking, which crosses
the Hoang-Ho about 100 miles
from Nanking. On the south
side of the Hoang-Ho is the
town of Pengpu (Pang-fou).
There are no further major
obstacles except a little hilly
country until Nanking is reached.
On December 28 the Nation-
alists abandoned Pengpu.
Nanking lies on the south
bank of the Yangtsz-kiang,
across the wide river from its
companion town of P’u-kou.
Once across the Hoang-Ho there
are several linked roads which
can be used for convergence on
Nanking.
The advancing Communists
seem to have been using these
roads—from Yingchow, from
Tsinkianggou, as well as the
main line of advance along the
railway. They soon proved, by
various operations, that oppos-
ing troops in the area between
the Hoang-Ho and the Yangtsz-
kiang were not safe.
The commander of the
Nationalist forces withdrew his
h.q. to Ch’u-hsien, about 30
miles from Nanking. Every-
thing north of Nanl&ng is in
chaos. The country is under
snow, a factor which has ap-
parently caused something of a
temporary blockage. This is not
likely to last long, as Chiang
Kai-shek and his generals well
know. They have asked the
Communists to “co-operate with
the Government and bring peace
to China.” The Communists,
when this was written, had made
no reply.
Chiang’s appeal is tantamount
to an offer to surrender. No-
body knows better than he
where compromise with Com-
munism leads.
The U.S. Fleets.
“Ek Dum”: Plans are out for
the dispersal of the U.S. Navy
during 1949, subject to events
which might change it radically.
The bulk of the main fleets,
it is announced, are to remain
laid up —664 majof warships
and about 1300 minor ones.
The two main fleets are on a
patrol basis, with from 65 to 75
per cent, of war-time comple-
ments.
In the Pacific there will be
five carriers, three escort carriers,
15 cruisers, 48 destroyers, 35
submarines, five destroyer-
escorts, with a battleship and 16
destroyers on basiG comple-
ments in reserve for training.
The Atlantic and Mediter-
ranean Fleet will be made up of
six carriers, four escort-carriers,
12 cruisers, 53 destroyers, 41
submarines, three destroyer
escorts, With a battleship, two
light carriers, four cruisers, 18
destroyers and five destroyer-
escorts set aside with minimum
crews for training reserves.
Meanwhile; new construction
is limited. The 65,000-ton
carrier which is being, or has
been, laid down with the New-
port News Dockyard Company
is expected to take five years to
complete at a cost of about
£40,000,000 Australian. She will
be comparable in length with the
Queen Mary and Queen Eliza-
beth —about 1030 ft. on the
waterline but will measure
nearly 1100 ft. overall. Her nor-
mal maximum beam will be
190 ft., extendable to 230 ft. by
hinged parts.
The ship will be heavily
armed and will be driven by
280,000 h.p. which is expected to
give a speed well above 30 knots.
The aircraft complement will
be 54 four-engined bombers,
each capable of carrying atom-
bombs —presumably one atom-
bomb each —with a range of
1700 miles.
Other U.S. construction under
way includes a 27,000-ton carrier
of the Essex class, due for com-
pletion towards the end of this
year, the 17,000-ton cruisers Des
Moines, Newport News and
Salem, which should be finished
now. They are devastating and
revolutionary vessels, each
carrying nine of the new eight-
inch rapid-fire, 55-cal. guns,
which will be mounted in “fully
automatic” turrets and use case
ammunition. They are so
heavily armored as to be almost
classable as pocket-battleships.
They could certainly smash up
anything which the Germans
owned under that designation.
Also building in U.S. yards
are two 14,700-ton cruisers
which are classified as “light.”
They are to be named Roanoke
and Worcester, with a dozen
dual-purpose guns in twin
turrets. If these are light, what
is Hobart?
A couple of submarine killer-
ships equipped with the newest
anti-submarine devices they
are somewhere in the 6000-7000-
ton range—four 2500-ton de-
stroyers and 14 submarines
fitted with schnorkel (speed, sub-
merged, about 17-18 knots) com-
pletes the list, and there is a
considerable amount of recon-
struction and refitment in pro-
gress on existing ships to add
the latest gadgets.
It is pretty difficult to find
space for some of these in ships
already congested, but new
equipment will mean a consider-
able saving in work and in small
ships. The helicopters, for in-
stance, with which it is intended
to equip all battleships and
cruisers will cut out a lot of
destroyer work.
Apart from vessels on which
construction is going ahead,
there are several important ones
which are in abeyance. These
include the battleship Kentucky
—45,000 tons, 887 ft. long,
108 ft. beam, originally designed
to carry nine 16in. guns, 20 sin.,
four aircraft and a couple 6f
catapults and a complement of
2700. This giant, compeer of
H.M.S. Vanguard, recently was
in process of being turned into
a “missile” ship, along with the
battle-cruiser Hawaii. Work on
them has been halted apparently
while waiting for further de-
velopment of “missiles.”
Two London Sunday journals,
not necessarily reliable, re-
ported that Mr. Bevin had
warned the U.S. Government
that if Israel continued break-
ing the Palestine truce and
attacking the Egyptians, Britain
might feel bound to make war on
Israel. There has been a U.N.O.
cease-fire order out against
Israel, but, curiously enough,
the flagrant breaches of it have
not generated any fulminatio'ns
from Dr. Evatt and Colonel
Hodgson.
* * # *
Dr. Evatt’s two allies who
have been sharing the hysterics
of the Australian U.N.O. dele-
gates over the measures the
Dutch have been taking in Java
have agreed on a cease-fire in
Kashmir. There the two devout
pacifist Asian States have been
clandestinely fighting each other
for a year. The mediator who
waved the olive branch appropri-
ately came from Colombia,
which last April was under
martial law, its capital described
as a “shambles.”

PERSONAL ITEM!
Don Bradman, Knight of the Scintil-
lating Century, now Knight Bachelor,
Chief Scout Lord Rowallan is in Ring-
wood, Victoria, as Old Man to the 11,000
scouts and rovers brought here from
Pacific countries for this year’s jamboree.
He has four boys of his own (another
was killed in action early in Hitler’s
war), was in France in 1914-18 and com-
manded a battalion of the Royal Scotch
Fusiliers there again in 1940. He suc-
ceeded Lord Somers, a former Governor
of Victoria, to the Chief Scoutship in
1945.
Edward Hamriierstein, in Melbourne
to direct “Oklahoma” for the Firm, be-
longs to the theatrical dynasty whose
Oscar II was responsible for “Rose
Marie,” “The Desert Song,” “Show
Boat” and scores of other plays and
films, the latest production of his flam-
boyant genius being the current opus.
Oscar I was the. German-American im-
presario who invaded the U.S.A. in 1863
and stormed Broadway, built the Man-
hattan Opera House, in which Melba
sang, the Philadelphia Opera House and
other theatres, and then went to London
and built the London Opera House.
When that failed he changed over to The
movies. Hammerstein, junior, was stage
director of the original production at St.
James’ Theatre, NX, of “Oklahoma,”
which, running for five years, three
months *and 28 days, just beat Oscar
Asche’s record with “Chu Chin Chow.”
On the 14th of last month the brand-
new liner Orcades sailed from Tilbury for
Australia. She replaces her namesake
sunk by torpedoes off the African coast
in 1942, anti though the name is about the
only relation the new craft bears to
the old, there is one fitting not
replaced—her captain, Charles Fox,
C.8.E., who saw old Orcades founder
under him. Fast and of revolutionary
construction, Orcades will cut the U.K.-
Melbourne time from 36 days to 27 days,
and on trials her 28,200 tons reached
24£ knots. An unusual feature is the
combination of heft single mast and
funnel in a construction resembling a
naval control-tower. The bridge is further
aft than in earlier Orient types, and no
ventilators mar her smooth lines. Her
innards are a picture; some special suites
are in effect air-conditioned flats, with
bed- and sitting-rooms, entrance-hall,
bathroom and private verandah extending
to the ship’s side. She cost £3i million,
can carry 5500 tons of cargo and 1500
passengers. Her skipper, still on the good
side of 60, went to sea at the turn of the
century, was a lieutenant with the British
Navy in the Kaiser’s war, and he married
a Sydney girl.
It’s come at last —appointment of
Margaret Henderson Kidd, of the
Scottish Bar, as King’s Counsel, is re-

Trinco” views a U.S. diplomat:
Sumner Welles, the 6ft. 3in. correct and
mannerly former U.S. Under-Secretary of State
who was found partly frozen outside his home
in Washington the other day, has been de-
scribed as that “tall glass of distilled ice-water.”
Americans like to think of him as their Anthony
xiden, but the easy analogy, though applying
truly enough to the cool, precise, impeccably-
dressed and greying-at-the-temples aspect of
both diplomats, fails to consider that while
Lden practises in a land where politicians—or
some of them —are gentlemen from top-hats to
spats, Welles was born a little gentleman in a
land of roughnecks. Unlike Roosevelt, he never
got over it. Welles’s whole career followed the
correct and honorable path: he viewed inter-
national affairs in terms of these virtues. When
Hitler marched into Prague in 1939 against his
promises, Welles was stunned and shocked, and
his bitterest indictment of the Nazi leaders was
the fact that, during his 1940 last-minute peace
mission for the President, they lied to his face.
Of II Duce he wrote: “It should never be for-
gotten that Mussolini remained at heart and
in instinct an Italian peasant.”- It was inevitable
that in American politics, whose practitioners
take pains to proclaim their “peasant” origin,
the man who allegedly (probably only a
legend) played as a child with white gloves
? n J^ s kands should go under to the veteran
feuders, the sage political infighters ranged
against him. It is now generally accepted that
he was forced out of, and did not voluntarily
resign from, his job as Under-Secretary of
State. Welles and his chief, Cordell Hull, had
little time for each other, and Hull, old and
sick, refused to retire until assured Welles would
not get his place. It seems Welles’s main fault
was that, in his ambition to climb up, he forgot
to climb down.
Dr. Leonard Huxley goes to the Chair
of Physics at Adelaide Uni., from acting-
headship of Birmingham Uni.’s Depart-
ment of Electrical Engineering, with a list
of distinctions as long as your arm. In
the last dust-up he was head of telecom-
munication research in England, and
made the aerials of Britain’s coastal warn-
ing-stations his particular pigeon—to the
definite detriment of the Luftwaffe. He
relieves Professor Kerr Grant.
P. Kean, a Queensland late-war
Digger working on a silver-lead-mining
venture between Charters Towers and
Townsville, can claim to be a self-made
man if his idea proves successful, as it
promises to. King’s Mine, Ravenswood,
was a big producer in the ’eighties, but
has been idle since 1890. Up to then it
had disgorged £ 136,000-worth of silver-
lead. Kean has retraced its 9ft. to lift,
lode nearly a mile along the surface.
Last year, using two Army Disposal
trucks, he carried, in 20 trips, 90 tons of
mining machinery over typical back-
blocks roads from Maytown, on the old
Palmer goldfield, to Chillagoe. Still over
300 miles from point of installation, the
cumbersome stuff had to be railed to
Mingela, then hauled the last 28 miles
overland to Ravenswood. The Queens-
land Mines Minister thinks Kean’s mine
has excellent possibilities. Whatever it
has, there seems little doubt the perti-
nacious Digger will succeed in getting it.
Revealed here by Prior is B. J.
Edwards, 0.8. E., the television expert
who had a tilt with Senator Cameron
when he called f.m. “an American racket.”
Behind a quiet almost deprecating ex-
terior, Edwards hides one of the most
alert brains in British radio. In Aus-
tralia recently to look over television pros-
pects for Pye, Ltd., the big radio-electri-
cal firm of Cambridge, of which he’s chief
of research —a branch of the company to
manufacture television receivers is al-
ready building in Melbourne—he brought
interesting news of Britain’s television.
Three hundred thousand sets operating'in
and around London, cost £4O each, and
a backlog of 35,000 orders on the com-
pany’s books, which is turning out 1000
sets a week. Edwards declares that the
reason British sets are superior in range,
presentation and cost to the. American
job is that the former use positive modu-
lation, the latter negative. Bitten by
the television bug as early as 1929,
Edwards went on to radar research early
in the piece with Watson Watt, played a
king-pin part in putting radar sets into
Britain’s night-fighters and became radar
adviser to Air-Marshal Harris’s Bomber
Command, where his work brought him
his 0.8. E. He believes our cities could be
televisionally linked by placing relaying
aerials on mountains in between, but that
the stiff excise tax on valves here —tele-
vision uses three times the radio number
of valves —will influence costs. A
B.J. EDWARDS, television expert ,
new camera developed by Pye has a range
of two miles, and can cover functions
from football matches or a ship coming
up-harbor to cooking and dressmaking
lessons for housewives. The next step is
color presentation. Edwards spent
a fortnight in Melbourne before returning
to Cambridge. His hobby is television.
Professor Herbert Burton, appointed
first principal of the Canberra University
College and Dean of the Faculty, was
born at Ipswich (Q.), in 1900, and has
since lived a life almost exclusively con-
fined to the academic cloisters of three
States and at Oxford. Queensland
Rhodes scholar for 1922, he went to
Queen’s College, Oxford, and graduated
PROF. BURTON, Canberra Uni.
Principal.
with first-class honors in the School of
Modern History. A Rockefeller fellow-
ship- in 1935 gave him chance to
study European economy at first hand,
and on return he was appointed Chairman
of the Board of Studies in Public Adminis-
tration, Melbourne. He has contributed
a raft of essays, books and chapters of
books to our knowledge of Australian
economics and history, provided a section
to Hartley Grattan’s Australia, revised the
seventh edition of Ernest Scott’s Short
History of Australia, and is now at work
on biographies of eminent Australians
for the Dictionary of National Biography.
He also studies trout-fishing and golf,
“Fitz”: Just published by Routledge,
The Aunt's Story is Patrick White’s
third novel —the other two are Happy
Valley, a gold-medal winner, and The
Living and the Dead. Born in 1912 in
London, where his Australian parents
happened to be visiting, White spent his
childhood in Australia and returned to
England for schooling at Cheltenham.
Coming back here, he worked as a
jackeroo—father, grandfather and great-
grandfather all were sheepmen—and
scribbled at night. Back in England, he
read Modern Languages at King’s Col-
lege, Cambridge, and decided that writ-
ing was more interesting than tending
jumbucks. Apart from novel-writing he
has 'written short stories, sketches and
lyrics for West End theatrical revues and
verse. Dtiring World War II he was an
Intelligence Officer in the R.A.F. for four
years in the Middle East and a year in
Greece. In Australia again, he hopes to
write more novels and to cultivate olives.
“Unicorn”: Fellow-scribes who got
their start on the now-defunct Christ-
church (M.L.) “Sun” will remember E.
C. Huie, an Australian by birth, but one
of the finest journalists and newspaper
heads Maoriland produced. I met him
again in Wellington after many years, and
the old man, still young in the head and
in his sense of humor, recalled the days
when his handpicked editorial staff tried
for three years to dig the “Sun” in under
the “Herald” and Auckland “Star.” Our
lack of advertising and their concrete
foundations beat us, but it was a good
effort, Percy Crisp, then editor, is now
head of a London daily; lan Coster also
reached the top in Fleet-street; and car-
toonist Minhinnick, thought by some to be
Maoriland’s finest, slipped across to the
N.Z. “Herald.” A number of writers
who have since niched themselves in
Australia started on the “Sun,” and I
think Elizabeth Riddell —whose Poems
was reviewed on Red Page 1/12//48 —
is one.
When warships enter Williamstown
Dockyard in Melbourne for refit, im-
portant compartments—magazines, wire-
less and radar offices and so on —are
locked tight against civilian intrusion.
But to one five-foot-odd civvy the most
secret room is thrown open. He is H.
Mihailoff, a human ferret employed by
the Ship Construction Branch at Navy
Office to check, with a ship’s plans in hjs
hand and in his head the most minute
knowledge of her innards, whether she
still conforms to the original plans laid
down by her designer. Every fitting,
from a mast shroud to bottle-rack stow-
ages for 4in. cartridges, must pass his
eager scrutiny. He is also an expert
model-maker, and in this field developed
a novel method of semi-silhouette,
whereby full constructional details are
shown, and, to bearings well before and
abaft the beam, the illusion of full beam
of the ship is given. During the last
dust-up his models of warships and mer-
chantmen—among them Wanganella and
U.S. cruiser Duluth —filled recognitiorf-
training-rooms. Duluth’s men, who were
in Sydney in 1947, were so impressed by
the image that it now sails in a glass
case in the ship’s wardroom.
The übiquitous Australian again.
Honor of introducing the King’s
Christmas Day broadcast from Bucking-
ham Palace went to a Perth man,
Brigadier Don Cleland. A solicitor before
World War II attracted him to a recruit-
ing office, he got free passages to North
Africa, Greece, Crete, Syria, Java and
New Guinea, as well as a C.B.E. With the
cease-fire he took a hand in politics, stood
for Fremantle in 1945 and found him-
self among the politically slain, Kim
Beazley being the instrument. The same
year Cleland was elected a Westralian
rep. on the Libs’ Federal executive, and
went on to the Federal directorship of the
party shortly afterwards, a job he’s still
holding.
The ranks of Melbourne’s K.Cs. have
acquired their youngest member in J. X.
O’Driscoll, 45, a member of the legal
profession since 1926. A Christian
Brothers’ dux, he graduated in law from
Melbourne Uni., and to the rank of
squadron-leader in the R.A.A.F. in the
last dust-up.
Passed on in Sydney at 59, Tommy
Adrian, the Old Digger who in the
1914-15 swimming season surprised
watery circles by beating the noted
Hawaiian Duke P. Kahanamoku in the
440-yards N.S.W. title event, after the
visitor had shown his soles to Australia’s
best watermen oyer sprint distances.
Adrian early realised “Boy” Charlton’s
possibilities, took him in hand and saw
them realised when the youngster created
a world’s record for the 880 in 1923 and
beai Arne Borg, of Sweden, the next
year. He went with Charlton as coach
to the 1924 Olympiad, but serious illness
contracted en route prevented his seeing
his protege win the Olympic 1500 metres
in world-record time. Adrian’s sickness
kept him in Paris for a year and affected
him so badly that he was unable again
tb interest himself in* bis sport.
Into the silence;
At New Farm, Brisbane, at 60, J. C. Clark,
a grazier in a big way who raced horses and
yachts with equal success. Among the former
was Brisbane River; in \is other element he
won the Australian championship in Sydney and
Brisbane with 18-footer Vision, and the 16ft.
skiff Australian title with Valmas.
At Auckland (ML.), at 77, Archdeacon
Hector Alfred Hawkins, who did missionary
work among the Maoris before going overseas
with the first M.L. E.F. as chaplain. He accom-
panied the Diggers in France, Belgium and
Egypt. During the second war he served five
years in M.L, as senior chaplain.
In Sydney, at 59, Tom Watson, after a long
illness. Few men knew more about western
N.S.W. land values. Connected with land-
settlement in the State for over 40 years, he
qualified as a surveyor in 1912, was with the
Lands Department in the metropolitan, Mudgee
and Forbes districts, and, opening a private
land agency in 1934, extended jt into what is
now a very healthy concern.
At Southport (Eng.), at 81, Bob Martin, to
whom dog-lovers throughout the world are
debtors. Fifty years ago he originated his
famous condition-powders for dogs, in a small
back-street shop in Southport. A qualified vet.,
he attended all dog-shows within range of his
tribycle, and with two greyhounds running
alongside was as well known locally as his
product is globally.


Women’s Letters
From Melbourne
Hogmanay was celebrated in the tradi-
tional manner throughout the city. One
of the nightclubs served breakfast to
many ddncers at 6.30 on the first day of
the New Year. Balloons and bowls of
bright flowers made a gay background
at Ciro’s for the beautiful gowns of those
who danced the old year out. Judge and
Mrs. Simpson, from India, brought a
large party. Mrs. Simpson’s white crepe
dinner-gown had as its only trimming a
wide gold belt. Among their guests were
Mrs. Ralph Skinner, whose aqua-green
chiffon gown was trimmed with matching
sequins; Mrs. Ken Wetherell, who wore
over her floral evening gown a powder-
blue jacket with silver-bead trimming;
Mrs. John Ingleton, her dinner gown of
white crepe, and her sister Eileen Hattam,
in pastel-blue satin. Mrs. Frank Watts
wore dove-grey crepes under a white
ermine coat. Mrs. Branchflower’s beige
lace gown was worn over deep-brown
taffeta, the off-the-shoulder bodice being
trimmed with gold sequins. Daughter
Judy wore a simple gown of aqua-blue
silk jersey. Mrs. N, Dethridge combined
white net and lace. Mrs. Gordon
Leonard’s pink-and-grey-striped taffeta
had the draped off-the-shoulder bodice.
Attendance on New Year’s Day at
Flemington was small, partly on account
of the cold, wet weather. A well-
dressed racegoer was Mrs. Harold
Rabling, whose deep-mauve satin rain-
coat was worn over a black suit and
with a small black hat. Mrs. Voss
Smith’s bright navy wool suit was worn
with a pastel-pink velvet snood with side
drapings. Mrs. James Buchanan added a
small bowler-hat of nigger-brown felt to
her beige-wool tailored coat, which had
a lynx-fur collar. Mrs. A. L. Walters’s
unusual small pork-pie hat of Patou-pink
silk jersey had draperies of the same
material falling from back and sides to
meet under the chin. A lime-green coat
and floral head-scarf formed the en-
semble worn by Mrs. Basil Glowrey. Mrs.
Alfred Fowler matched with a hat her
aqua-blue jacket-suit. Mrs. Keith Kiddle
wore a grey tailored suit; her daughter,
Mrs. Bill Jamieson, had London-tan ac-
cessories for her China-blue wool coat,
suit and hat of London tan. Mrs. Nor-
man Shepherd’s suit was navy, her hat
navy and white. Keira Cameron’s
mustard-yellow suit was topped with a
matching hat which carried brown quill
feathers.
New Year revels commenced for
members of the South Yarra Tennis
Club with a late-afternoon party in the
clubhouse. Among revellers were Mrs.
Desmond Hollywood, in a lime-toned
moire taffeta jacket-suit; Anne Wilton,
who teamed a black ballerina skirt with
a page-boy jacket of soft beige wool;
Mrs. Frank Greig, whose powder-blue
crepe frock had softly-pleated skirt and
draped bodice ; Mrs. Val Gibbs, in black
moire taffeta tailored coat and black vel-
vet snood trimmed with gold studs ; Mrs.
N. Robertson, her frock a black taffeta
ballerina ; Angela Fink, her black-and-
white-patterned blouse allied to a black
ankle-length skirt; and Mrs. Bill Purves,
whose cocktail.frock was of black crepe.
Lady Gepp, who returned in the
Strathaird after a five-months visit to
son-in-law and daughter, Group-Captain
and Mrs. Richard Gething, who live in
Surrey, was guest of honor at a cocktail
party given by Mrs. M. R. Lonie at her
Toorak home. The bodice of Mrs.
Lonie’s navy crepe frock had the new
bracelet sleeves. Lady Gepp wore a
pastel-pink jacket embroidered with gold
thread over a gown of black velvet. The
Gepps’ two daughters were there: Mrs.
Curtis Wilson wearing a poppy-red dress
with an overprint of black and white, and
Kathleen Gepp in waist-length white-and-
gold jacket and black velvet evening skirt.
Large taffeta bows fashioned the smart
hat worn by Rita Findlay with'her black
frock. Sonia O’Brien’s slim-fitting even-
ing gown was of floral silk. Mrs. Frank
Lonie, daughter-in-law of the hostess,
trimmed the net top of her brown crepe
frock with green sequins.
Racegoers at the Mornington Club’s
meeting who gambled on the weather-
man’s being wrong and went in flimsies
were unlucky—the torrential downpour
almost washed the meeting out. Mrs.
Ken Guest was one of the prudent—her
smart raincoat of black satin had the
extra comfort of a, hood; Mrs. J. Cud-
digan’s Alice-blue ensemble was worn
with a matching blue coarse-straw hat
trimmed with pastel-pink roses. Mrs.
Bunty Watt wore a floral frock under a
tailored black coat. Mrs. Reg Ansett’s
dark nautical-blue tailored suit was of
gabardine. A summer-weight grey coat
kept Mrs. J. Mpuntjoy’s florals from the
weather. Nancy Hamilton, who has just
announced her engagement to Tom Guest,
was tailored in grey, with a multicolored
straw hat for contrast. Mrs. A. McHarg’s
black tailored suit was worn with a small
black hat. Mrs. Henry Dennett’s silks
were cerise. Mrs. A. L. Walters sported
a hiplength red jacket over a blue-and-
white-spotted frock. A matching head-
scarf went with Nan Walsh’s blue satin
raincoat.
It was a night of contrasts at the revival
at His Majesty’s of “White Horse Inn.”
Men in the audience removed their coats ;
some women wore street frocks, others
low-cut evening gowns. On stage
members of the cast wore heavy period
costumes and the ballet, despite the high
humidity, danced with a zest more
applicable to Antarctic weather. In the
first act the ballet danced in palest-blue
marquisette skirts and deep-blue satin
bodices, toning with the jackets worn by
the male dancers with their cream flannels
—a bright effect. Another good number
was the “Umbrella ballet,” during which
torrents of rain fell and brightly-colored
umbrellas bobbed up and down. Among
first-nighters were Mrs. M. Sallmann,
whose ankle-length dove-grey chiffon
frock featured a bustle; Mrs. M. Sloman
in a sleeveless dinner gown which was
patterned in cherry-red and white; her
daughter Barbara, whose printed gown in
pastel blues and pinks was finished at the
deep neckline with a ruffle of white
broderie Anglaise ; Mrs. T. Allan McKay,
touches of silver lame embellishing her
hyacinth-blue crepes ; Mrs. A. Silk, whose
Nile-green crepe frock had broad tucks
on either side of the skirt; Mrs. Walter
Rothfield, her powder-blue crepe gown
cut on Grecian lines; Mrs. M. Nathan,
black chiffon with bands of silver em-
broideries her choice; and Mrs. Bill
Paterson in a white net gown, the neckline
of which was outlined with a Bertha
frill of lace.
Attractive and vivacious, June Clyde is
the star of “Born Yesterday,” due to
open next Saturday night at the Comedy.
June has been on the stage since she was
six years old. An American, she has
spent a lot of her time in London making
films. In all she made 22, playing oppo-
site James Mason, John Mills and the late
Richard Tauber. June has one son, T.
Anthony Freeland, who, brought from
America by his aunt, will have to remain
in Sydney until his mother can find a flat
here.
From Sydney
High revelry at King’s Cross and Palm
Beach on New Year’s eve. The Cross
lived up to its reputation of good-
humored fun. All streets leading to it
were jammed tight long before midnight.
There was dancing and singing, and
streamers and lots of fancy costumes. In
fact, all around the city there was danc-
ing, the shrill of the siren, the cracking
of bonbons as the old year bowed in the
New. And the Highlanders were up all
night, and then turned out to the Cale-
donian sports handsome and debonair
with kilts swinging, cairngorms gleaming
and bagpipes making sweet moan. One
of the most pictorial sights of the season
was a group of Highlanders striding out
of the green background of Albert Park
into the grey twilight of New Year's
night. It brought up a nostalgia in which
Bonnie Prince Charley and Bobbie Burns,
and the tartan-bound Southland of
Maoriland, and Lochaber No More
were somehow tangled.
Everybody, of course, is buying, on the
cash or credit system, the first Volume of
the Churchill memoirs, The Gathering
Storm, but there is another Churchill
book going the rounds. It contains quota-
tions from the warrior - statesman’s
speeches. These are as applicable to
conditions in this uneasy peace as during
the perils of war. No finer New Year
resolution than this:
Let us, then, address ourselves to our
task, in good heart and sober confidence,
resolved that, whatever the cost, whatever
the suffering, we shall stand by one another,
true and faithful comrades, and do our
duty, God helping us, to the end.
Not only has Manon music gay and
tender and emotionally passionate to
sing, but she has clothes. The ’teen-ager
of today has nothing on Manon. When
she stepped out of the coach which was
bringing her from her convent school
she was exactly like a Dresden-china
figurine, in the inn courtyard (set on the
stage of the Tivoli). Curls, tiny platter
hat, panniers and all! The G.ls. would
have gone for her in a big way. Then
her gleaming satin pale-blue and pale-
pink panniered frock is surely the right
decor in which to listen to her lover’s
“Dream” aria. Finally, when she has
graduated to the baccarat school, she
glitters with jewels. Her moires of
damson-plum shade are alight with
them ; so are the aigrettes on her tight
little white turban.
Many composers do not consider their
heroines in this respect at all. Aida is
a slave, Mimi a poor little flowermaker
with only a cotton frock and a shawl to
protect her against the snowstorm, San-
tuzza is a Sicilian peasant, Nedda, a one-
night-stand show-girl, and poor Gilda
makes her final appearance in a sack. It
is true that Tosca is beautifully turned
out. But, of course, she is an actress and
earning her own money, and probably the
Actors’ Union of the time would not
have allowed her to be presented shabbily.
No, once the girls step into these parts

Mrs. John Metcalfe, wife of the
chief of the Public Library, has suc-
ceeded Ruby Board, who recently re-
signed, to the, N.S.W. presidency of the
National Council of Women. This is a
job that calls for an all-round knowledge
of women’s aims and women’s move-
ments. Mrs. Metcalfe graduated to presi-
dency through the office of State honorary
secretary of the N.C.W. Mrs. Metcalfe
is also the president of the Lyceum Club
—a women’s club with international
affiliations whose members are actively
interested in the Arts. Dorothy Welding

Sydney has now another knight and

From Lightning Ridge to Boggabilla,
White Cliffs to Wilcannia; from Hay

west Children’s holiday camp at Manly.
The job of keeping the larder full is a
gargantuan one —these times of high prices
it would take almost some Hercules of
finance to balance the budget. How-
ever, no doubt friends and admirers of
this memorial to a grand Australian,
Stanley Drummond, will help out. Who
could help admiring Stanley Drummond
and his wife Lucy, who 25 years ago had
a dream of bringing the Pacific and the
kiddies of the arid far west together?
And in the quarter-century 2850 boys
and girls who had never seen the sea,
who lived so far away from it that even
today transport to the railhead at Cobar,
Dubbo and Coonamble is long and
arduous, have been brought for a raptur-
ous three weeks to Manly, probably the
loveliest beach in Australia. These sea-
side camps arrive with each Christmas-
tide. But all through the year there is
the Far-west Health home in .Manly,
where children from the outback are
brought for medical attention and super-
vision.
Our Art Gallery is one of the
city’s most awkward places to get to.
Unless you go by taxi or car you are in
for a walk through the Domain. But in
spite of last Wednesday’s heat dozens of
citizens called in to see the English water-
colors. One attendant declared that
streams of visitors viewed it each day.
Maybe it is the peace and serenity breath-
ing through these vistas of Windermere
and Grasmere that capture the imagina-
tion. Here in the Thomas Girtin paint-
ing, looking as everlasting as immortality,
the spire of Godaiming Church points to
a soft and luminous sky. Even the arches
and cloisters of ruined abbey and castle
have a tranquillity that endures beyond
the rage and hate yof those who would
have torn them down. There’s a touch of
Merrie England in the Rowlandson “King
George 111 Returning from Hunting
Through Eton.” Looking at the pro-
cession of horsemen are a group of
gypsyish people, a rotund old lady with a
fan, and near by a boy bowing very low
over his off-swept hat, and heads of
townsfolk at the windows of their meti-
culously-drawn houses.
The draughtsmanship in the water-
color drawings is just about perfection.
Malton’s “Royal Crescent, Bath,” and
Griffith’s “Hengwrt House” remind of
the fine detail in Sydney Ure Smith’s
watercolor drawings of a swiftly vanish-
ing New South Wales.
Coming out from this show of lake and
river and nebulous sky last Wednesday
this Letter met Dora Toovey. The clever
artist was bringing in her entry for the
Archibald portrait contest. She has
painted Hugh Laming, English journalist
and writer now writing in Sydney. An-
other entry for the Archibald will be
singing-teacher Roland Foster, who has
been painted by Jerrold Nathan. Inciden-
tally, the Roland Fosters have just had a
cable of good wishes for the New Year
from former American Ambassador in
Australia Robert Butler and his wife.
They also received a greeting-card show-
ing the Butler’s palatial abode in Havana,
Cuba, where Mr. Butler is now his coun-
try’s Ambassador. This is a hexagonal
building with side-wings. Across its front
there are about 40 windows and six bal-
conies. And what will really interest the
Australian housewife is that Mrs. Butler
reports an inside staff of 18!
All last week Sydney was gay. Just
when the Christmas spirit began to sag
the New Year spirits arrived. There were
cocktail-parties and lunches and dances
and suppers. There were races threading
the afternoons; when the AJ.C. ended at
Randwick Tatter sail’s got busy with their
meeting. Dresses were cool, hats shady
and women contented-looking. A number
of country women dashed out for a
flutter between parties. The Morshead
lady was seen with daughter Mrs. M.
Kidd, of Echo Hills. Mrs. Tony Hordern
junior’s flowered-silk frock and shady
brown-straw hat was typical race-dressing.
Mrs. Philip Dare, of Melbourne, was
smart in a peg-top frock of dove-grey
and a large black picture-hat. The Teddy
Hammersteins also gave Randwick a
look-oVer. Mr. and Mrs. Hammerstein
are now in Melbourne, where he will pro-
duce the big Hammerstein show
“Oklahoma.”
Heath Burdoch, who has been in broad-
casting for over 20 years (now 2UE),
celebrated his silver wedding recently. He
and his bride of 25 years ago gave a
theatre-party. Both Mr. and Mrs.
Burdoch are keen poiocrosse players, and
are members of the Killara Poiocrosse
Club.
Tenor Kenneth Neate writes to his
Sydney teacher, Lute Drummond, now at
Whitehall, 27 Tryon-road, Lindfield:
I have received a letter from Maestro
Votto, the director of the May Festival in
Florence, and he said that my voice appealed
most satisfactorily to the committee, and
that they would be most happy to have me
sing at their festival if it could be arranged.
I have also been approached to sing the
Duke of Mantua in Nice this coming
February, so I am hoping I can arrange
with Covent Garden to get a week off.
Next week I go to Dublin for three per-
formances of “Rigoletto.” I am looking for-
ward to this very much, for the Irish audi-
ence is very Latin in temperament and
really goes to enjoy its opera,
Ken is now studying with Giovanni
Inghilleri and with Lucien Muratore,
tenor, contemporary of the De Reszkes
and early Caruso period. L. Muratore,
who has the highest opinion of Ken both
as singer and actor, had his entire set of
Don Jose (a part Ken had studied with
him) costumes prepared for the Austra-
lian, and the last time Ken was in
Paris presented them to him.
What have they got that we haven’t?
At 85 novelist H. de Vere Stacpoole is
still turning out his two or three books
a year. Early in 1949 his 54th and 55th
romances will be published. Their titles
will be The Land of Little Horses and
Man in Armour. This author ignores
typewriters or fountain-pens—he writes
with a quill on lined foolscap. The film
version of Blue Lagoon, the whole cast
of which passed through Sydney on its
way to the Pacific-island location, is
about to be shown in London theatres.

This is Australia’s biggest publishing
house. In Melbourne it turns out two
dailies, three weeklies, one fortnightly,
three periodicals and owns two broad-
casting stations (3DB and 3LK). It also
has substantial share interests in the
“Courier-Mail” (Brisbane), “Advertiser,”
“News,” “Chronicle,” “Mail,” “Express
and Journal” (Adelaide) and “Barrier
Miner” (Broken Hill), as well as in Aus-
tralian Newsprint Mills, a venture which
the co. pioneered and which proved a life-
saver to Australian newspaper and other
publishers.
And the board has a big programme
of expansion and development on hand,
including installation of large speed
presses, with color attachment, for the
dailies, and establishment of a color-
gravure section, to take care of the co.’s
national-magazine and book-publishing
schemes, which the board intends to “de-
velop on a large scale.” First venture in
this direction, “Australian Woman’s Day,”
a 72-page sixpenny fortnightly, was suc-
cessfully launched on August 16 last. It
is to be converted to a weekly when more
plant and materials are available.
All the co.’s interests, except the fort-
nightly, contributed to the pool last term,
major profit - earners being the two
dailies —“Herald,” Melbourne’s unchal-
lenged evening broadsheet, and “Sun
News-Pictorial,” morning competitor of
the “Argus” and “Age.” During the year
daily circulation of the “Herald” increased
from 361,000 to 382,000, and that of the
“Sun” from 390,000 to 400,000. Circu-
lation of all the co.’s other and associated
journals increased, too.
Surprising feature of the latest
accounts was the leap of £46,509 in net
earnings. This was achieved despite a
rise in price' and 38 p.c. cut in the ration
of newsprint, with consequent reduction
in the amount of advertising carried —
the co. had to refuse at least £500,000-
worth of advertising business, the chair-
man says. The effects were only partly
offset by bigger sales, increase in the
number of columns per page and the lift
in advertising rates during the previous
term, as the shrinkage of £318,581 in
trading revenue shows:

It was reduced consumption of news-
print (down £424,256) that saved the day.
The saving here exceeded the drop in
revenue and growth in other exes, by
£34,777. To declared profit the “Wild
Cat” has added £60,860 allowed for de-
preciation and an unexplained £166,
all tossed into the “reserve for restora-
tion of stock and plant.” This reserve
(now £369,494)* is tax-free, and is to be
transferred to general reserves if not ulti-
mately required for the purpose for which
set up. Depreciation in the ordinary
sense of the term —known to be liberal
in the past —is deducted from the book-
value of assets concerned in the pub-
lished accounts.
The £292,330 of profit thus arrived at
covered *pref. requirements and 20.7 p.c.
on average ord. capital, or 18.7 p.c. on
ord. capital as it now stands, compared
with 18.4, 20.8, 20.6, 18.2, 18.1 and 14.5
p.c. back to 1942. On net tangible share-
holders’ funds the year’s profit was 9.5
p.c., a suggestion that assets are
conservatively valued in the boo)|s. The
div. was kept at 14 p.c.
To finance the growth of £665,973 in
net assets, .240,000 new £1 ords. were
issued at a premium of 335. each in May
last, raising paid capital to £1,840,000 in
125,000 £1 61 p.c. and 275,000 £1 6 p.c.
“B” prefs. and the balance ords. The
new capital and share premiums (the
latter were added to reserves) went mainly
into plant (up £370,086), freehold (up
£39,029), stocks (up £296,496) and share-
holdings (up £65,123): —•

Plant, of which more has yet to arrive
from overseas, includes six units of single-
width gravure presses made in the co.’s
own workshops.
The immediate outlook is for an in-
crease in both revenue and expenditure.
As for the net result, much will depend
upon the cost of establishing new publica-
tions, which usually take time to become
steady profit-earners, especially if com-
petition is keen, and it promises to be.
Abandonment of newsprint rationing, ex-
cept for purchases from the dollar area,
means extra supplies from the sterling
market. But landed cost from this source
is now about £75 a ton, as against £46
10s. Canadian and £4l 10s. Tasmanian.
Since the close of accounts the pound
ords. have been split into ss. units, which
the market prices at 20s. 3d. each, return-
ing 3.4 p.c. on a 14 p.c. div. basis. The
6£ per cents, at 325. 9d. and the 6 per
cents, at 30s. each return 4 p.c. Net tan-
gible cover is £24 12s. 2d. first and £lO

Better was expected from this Spring-
vale (Vic.) engineering and foundry busi-
ness, and the sharemarket has recorded
its disappointment. Capital, after being
doubled just before last term began, didn’t
earn sufficient to maintain 8 p.c. to the
ords. and first prefs. There was no major
industrial breakdown to contend with, as
in 1946-47, but the chief snag now quoted
by the board is irregular receipt of raw
materials, which has produced “a very
badly balanced” stock position, ballooned
'overhead charges and called for large
bank accommodation. While the direc-
tors believe production can be steered
nearer to a normal course this term, basic
metals are still in short supply, and some
of the co.’s products are beginning to
meet a stiffer market.
The 50-year-old Kelly and Lewis busi-
ness became a public cp. in 1939, and
almost immediately donned battledress.
When defence contracts tapered off six
years later the co. had expanded its scope
for civilian manufacture, which had
hitherto been concentrated mainly on
centrifugal pumps, air-compressors and
internal combustion-engines. Among the
items turned out nowadays by its eight
subsidiaries are A.C. and D.C. motors,
structural steel, laundry and agricultural
machinery; and these are the lines most
affected by lack of materials.
After a £180,231 addition over the last
twelvemonth, stocks accounted for 58 p.c.
of total assets. Debtors’ balances were
£71,515 higher, and the necessary finance
came from overdrafts (up £227,242) and
former cash holdings (down £34,379):

The net addition to fixed assets was
£12,971 after allowing £13,600 for de-
preciation (up £473) in the consolidated
accounts. Total tax provisions aren’t
specified; the parent’s own allowance
was nearly £4OOO higher at £7643, but in
neither year, apparently, are the provi-
sions final. Until recently the co. was
taxed as a “private” concern, and some
arrears of surtax are still chargeable to
reserves.
The £1 ords., quoted at 30s. a year ago
and 28s. in September, are now around
235. on ’Change; yield at 235. is
5.2 p.c. on the latest div. basis, and net
tangible asset backing is 265. 9d. The
first prefs. at 255, yield 4.5 p.c. from their
reduced div. (they participate with the
ords. up to 8 p.c.), and have net cover
of 735. sd. each. There is similar backing
for the second, non-participating 5 p.c,.

From a string of factories in Australia
and New Zealand this co. turns out re-
inf pipes for water-supply
etc., as well as *a wide range of other
cement products. It also owns 488,068
of the 700,000 £1 ords. in Hume In-
dustries (Far East) and two-thirds of the
£250,000 ord. capital in Hume Steel.
No divs. were received from the sub-
sidiaries last term. The spring of
£36,877 in net earnings was due to in-
creased turnover and efficiency follow-
ing plant additions totalling £71,948.
Shortages of labor, steel and cement
stood in the way of a better showing.
The N.Z. section, which had been a
drag, contributed to the pool. The
£77,079 of profit—best yet—covered
pref. requirements and 13.7 p.c. on the
half-million of ord, capital, compared
with 6.1, 5.7 and 2 p.c. for the three
preceding terms and 11.3 p.c. in 1939.
The div. was lifted from 5 p.c. to 1\ p.c.,
making the average 4,8 p.c. over the last
decade, during most of which earnings
were cramped by war-time restrictions.
The £210,741 added to reserves on
account of assets revaluation was mainly
bonus scrip received from the Far East
company.
Combined net earnings of parent
and subsidiaries was put at £202,099,
after deducting taxation (£53,230), extra
provision for depreciation (£20,000) and
outside shareholders’ interests (£27,099).
The figure is not a reliable guide to
future investment possibilities of the
parent’s scrip. It was bumped up by
inclusion (for the first time) of the Far
East co.’s exceptional earnings for nine
months to end 1947. There have since
been substantial changes in the Far East
co.’s capital account, and its earnings
are not expected to continue at the recent
extraordinary level. .
The Far East co. (Singapore) was
formed in 1922, and did well on a capital
of £50,000, which was increased to
£75,000 in 1937. The figure had grown
to £291,681 at end March, 1947, and
then shot up to £950,000 in 250,000 5 p.c.
cum. par. prefs. and 700,000 ords. The
prefs. were taken for cash by those on
Hume Pipe’s and Hume Steel’s registers.
Growth in ord. capital was as follows:

The bonus scrip came from a surplus of
£421,858 on revaluation of properties in
1946. The co.’s Hong Kong property
has since sold for £99,820 more than its
written-up book-value. Besides concrete
and steel pipes, the co. makes cement-
asbestos products, is engaged in general
and electrical engineering, and, in con-
junction with a U.S. co., in manufacture
of steel oil-drums. Allowing for taxa-
tion (£22,077), profit for the nine months
to end 1947 was £130,040, or 13.4 p.c.
on capital as it now stands. Estimated
profit for first half of 1948 was £59,300,
or at the rate of 12.4 p.c. p.a. on capital.
A 6 p.c. div. would be worth £29,284 to
H.P., or 5.8 p.c. on its ord. capital.
For year to end Sept, last Hume Steel
netted £19,519 (up £10,408), or £765 more
than its own pref. requirements.
Latest combined balance-sheet figures
are not strictly comparable with previ-
ous years, because the Far East co. s
figures are not included before 1948.
This explains most of the growth in the

BREWED AND BOTTLED BY TOOTH & CO. LIMITED
MAKERS OF GOOD BEER SINCE 1835
K8.22.M
time since production began in
1931. Silver-lead bullion, zinc
concentrates and copper-lead
dross are produced on the spot
and railed to Townsville, whence
the bullion, or most of it, is
shipped to Britain, the concen-
trates are sold on the European
market and the dross in U.S.
Technically the co. has put up
an excellent performance all
along the line; but slump,
anaemic metal markets, advanc-
ing costs and other difficulties
robbed shareholders of an early
return on their money. Owing
to war-time difficulties produc-
tion was switched from silver-
lead-zinc to all copper in April,
1943, and then back again in
May, 1946, in time to gather
harvests from rising metal prices.
Hence the sharp growth in
profits over the last couple of
years.
Shareholders got their first
div. (10 p.c.) in July, 1947, fol-
lowed by 17 p.c. in respect of last
term. Subject to the course of
metal prices and costs, better
might be expected when the new
copper plant comes into produc-
tion, and output from the rest of
the mine is stepped up. Mean-
while, the declared aim is to pay
a regular 10 p.c., plus “such
interim divs., from time h> time,
as the financial position of the
co. permits.”
Last term’s £872,921 (up
£370,336) of profit was 19.6 p.c.
on the £4,445,737 of share
capital, of which £1,944,202,
gathered during the first half of
the term for construction of
copper mining, milling and
smelting facilities, has not yet
had a chance to show what it
can do. Construction of the
copper plant has been disap-
pointingly slow, owing to delays
in deliveries and shortages of
materials and labor. Of the
year’s capital expenditure of
£223,996, only 55 p.c. was in
respect of the copper project.
When complete, this plant is
scheduled to handle 30,000 tons
copper sulphides for an output
of 1500 tons blister a month.
Annual metal production is then
expected to reach 2,775,0000 z.
silver, 37,000 tons lead, 24,000
tons zinc and 18,000 tons blister
copper.
Last term’s profit would have
been better still but for loss of
42 days’ production through
strikes, etc., and accumulation of
zinc concentrates —54,200 tons
were on hand when the books
closed. The spring in earnings
came from the rise in metal
prices combined with increased
production. London metal prices
moved in this way:

the co. for lead, f.o.b. Towns-
ville, for the four quarters of
1948 were £74, £B2, £9l 15s. and

the current term’s earnings.

SUNDRY SHOWS
CHILDREN'S WEEK.
Owing to the unfortunate
absence of two expert critics—
one is attending the jamboree
in Victoria and the other is con-
fined to the nursery with mumps
—it was difficult to get an ortho-
dox line on two shows of juvenile
interest in Sydney over the New
Year an exhibition o f
Children’s Art at David Jones’s
Gallery, and “A Kiss for Cin-
derella” at the Minerva.
The David Jones exhibition
had paintings and drawings by
children from a variety of
schools, drawn up, as it were, in
battalions, facing and flanking
each other. There seemed to
be some flavor of defiance about
this, something almost suggestive
of competition.
And there is a general im-
pression—no doubt ill-founded
-—that competition belonged to
the bad old pedagogic days,
when little children were flogged
for not doing their homework
and were forced to draw a car-
nation or a pencil-box while
their teacher surreptitiously read
a novel behind the class-roll.
In those days the drawing of
lions and tigers, circus-perform-
ers, gangsters, cowboys apd—on
occasion high-pigmented and
wasp-waisted young women was
something to be indulged in in
secret. Under the desk, per-
haps, or camouflaged by a piece
of blotting-paper when you were
supposed to be doing sums.
And, while the orthodox draw-
ing lessons, conducted, usually,
by a teacher who knew nothing
about art and cared less, were
a weariness to the spirit, secret
drawing was something of an
adventure and at times attained
the prestige of a secret vice.
Now, apparently, all that is
changed: modern children,
judging by the specimens of their
work at David Jones’s, can draw
or paint what they like. And in-
stead of being discouraged from
the depiction of gangsters and
tigers they will have in attend-
ance an instructor who will sym-
pathetically indicate the best
way to draw a tiger’s claws, and
the correct shading for the
handle of a death-dealing auto-
matic. Or, perhaps, with a
singular restraint, will refrain
from influencing in any way the
spontaneous flowering of the
child’s artistic nature.
This, in theory, should pro-
duce something like a Renais-
sance. But the pictures by the
child artists at David Jones’s
fall more or less flatly into
groups. Little girls draw or
paint admirably long-eyelashed
ladies. Little boys have a weak-
ness for muscles and violence:
and they fall naturally into age-
groups.
The Minerva show is a differ-
ent matter. Here, the appeal is
more frankly to the child, and it
is difficult, after this lapse of
years, to discover what the child
really thinks of Barrie’s whim-
sicality. A healthy child should,
anyway, be well content with
Kevin O’Donnel as Censor, for
he is agile in black mask and
tights, capers extraordinarily
and, whenever he knocks off the
head of a beauty whose size in
feet, or some other defect, have
failed to please the capricious
Prince, achieves a disarmingly
repulsive grin. And so with the
King (Eric Gormley), the illiter-
ate Queen (Nellie Bramley) and
policeman-Prince Grant Taylor.
And Coral Fairweather is, at
times, quite bewitching as Cin-
derella.
But these are the highlights.
Following the feast of the Ball,
there is the hospital scene where
sentiment is laid on so unspar-
ingly that it is rather like an
overdose of Christmas cake.
The Minerva was crowded
with children and guardian
adults, and although the former
let themselves go, as it were,
with shrill cries whenever a head
came off behind the curtains
with a resounding bump, few of
them made any audible com-
ment on the play itself. From a
less strictly juvenile aspect, parts
of the performance were delight-
ful. There was a formidable
mustering of beauty in the
Court scene, including a dark-
eyed Venus who was not, un-
fortunately, clad in Venus’s
traditional garb, but in a simple
white gown.
After the performance several
elderly ladies expressed them-
selves as delighted with the per-
formance. “Just the thing for
the children.” But the younger
children, by this time, w6re
clamoring to go home, and the
sophisticated 10- and 12-year-
olds maintained a dark and
superior silence.
Art and History.
The bulk of the English
watercolors sent out by the Em-
pire Art Loan Society for exhi-
bition in Australian galleries,
now to be shown in Brisbane,
cover the hundred years from
1750 to 1850.
They have, therefore, con-
siderable historical interest.
There are clear indications of
the development of watercolor
painting—which has now come
to be a characteristically British
art —from the early influence of
Wenzel Holler, the Bohemian
who came to England in 1635,
to the clear wash and preoccu-
pation with color and mood
characteristic of the later
painters ; a changeover from the
purely topographical to an
attempt to capture pure light and
emotion. And the exhibition
contains paintings by artists who
are representative, not only
of the development o f
watercolor paintings in Britain,
but of the finest achievements of
British art. Turner, Constable,
De Wint, Girtin, Cox, Palmer,
Varley and Brabazon ; of more
specifically historical interest,
Towne, Cotman, J. R. Cozens,
Sandby, William Havell, Fuseli
and the two Maltons, and many
more. In all, a hundred painters
are represented in the exhibition,
which came to Australia in its
entirety through the courtesy of
many' galleries and museums
throughout England who lent
pictures, and through the
courtesy of the Royal Family.
(Rowlandson’s “King George 111
Returning from Hunting
Through Eton,” and Sandby’s
“The North Terrace Looking
West,” both came from the
Royal Collection at Windsor.)
Yet the exhibition as a whole
is disappointing. Take the
Turners. One can hardly go far
wrong in taking Turner as repre-
sentative of the glory of English
painting; and, indeed, his
“Dudley Castle,” a brilliant
gleaming composition of lights,
darkness, boats and colored
water, with the castle perched
faintly above the shadows, is a
beautiful piece of work. If there
were a few more such paintings
in the exhibition, and if they
were signed by some other
artists one could say that it was
a highly-satisfying exhibition—
one well worth the trouble and
expense of bringing out from
England. But “Dudley Castle,”
beautiful as it is, and character-
istic though it is of Turner’s
style, does not express the com-
plete glory of Turner’s art. It
is not splendid enough. And of
the other Turners—“Malmes-
bury Abbey,” “The Thames
Looking Towards Westminster,”
“Kussnacht, Lake of Lucerne,”
“Exeter” and “Bellinzona”—
none of them shows the artist’s
full powers, and one, “A Swiss
Pass,” is a mere color-note.
Girtin’s “Godaiming Church”
is a fine piece of work. Con-
stable is represented by two pic-
tures, “Brighton Beach” and
“Near Folkestone.” The first is
technically excellent, but is a
type of picture any reasonably
competent English landscape
painter can produce without
much effort; as any gifted minor
poet, on occasion, can produce
an ode to a school chapel.
“Near Folkestone” is small,
lightly touched but individual,
with a rush of dark cloud across
a blue-and-white sky.
David Cox (1783-1859) is
represented by seven paintings,
of which the most striking is his
“Crossing Lancaster Sands,”
with horses and men small
figures on the luminous sands,
the sea a dark and falling
background and a skilful use
made of perspective and propor-
tion. Peter de Wint’s “Thames
a t Twickenham,” “Road
Through a Park” and “Bishop
Bridge, Norwich,” are oddly dis-
similar : “Road Through a
Park” is perfectly parklike—
masses of trees, tended grass and
cattle, with flecks of light on
trees and cattle, used, not as
Gruner would have developed
them, to bring the sparkle of
morning into a clear, open land-
scape but to suggest and, as it
were, reinforce the cool dark-
ness of the trees; an effect
almost equally beautiful.
Sir John Gilbert (1817-1897)
has a “Don Quixote in His
Study” which is as rich and
strong as an oil; a large paint-
ing with character in the seated
figure and the two figures look-
ing in at him from the door and
a perfection of detail in the
fabrics, woodwork and shining
armor in the room. This use to
which watercolor is put is a
contrast to the watercolors of
William James Muller (1812-
1845), whose “Riverside: Tidal
Estuary,” “Fishing Boats” and
“Arsenal Near Venice” are com-
pletely modern in treatment. A
bold, clear free-wash, dark
buildings with more suggested
than stated, boats and beauti-
fully luminous water. Muller’s
style is distinctive and, in its
way, flawless to an Aus-
tralian it suggests such con-
temporary painters as G. K.
Townshend.
On another branch of the his-
torical tree are the watercolors
of Thomas Malton (1748-1804),
Henry Fuseli (1741-1825) and
Rowlandson (1756-1827). Mal-
ton’s “Royal Crescent, Bath,” is
a painting of a huge barracks
with colored figures, officers,
coaches, horses, costumes per-
fectly rendered and the whole
not unlike an old sporting print.
Fuseli’s “Three Female Figures”
is a fine line drawing, with a
free and flowing line ; and Row-
landson’s “King George 111 Re-
turning From Hunting Through
Eton” belongs to the illustrative
genre.
The exhibition falls dowh
on the scarcity of paintings
which, simply and surely on
their own merits, are works of
art. There are paintings of
scenery, with fine draughtsman-
ship and a sweep and variety
more reminiscent of the early
Australian landscapes (which de-
rive from them) than of modern
English painting. There are
architectural records; but the
number of paintings, fike
Turner’s “Dudley Castle',” De
Wint’s “Road Through a Park,”
Muller’s “Fishing Boats” and
Walker’s “Fishmonger’s Shop,”
which command an artistic in-
terest independent of period, can
be counted almost on one hand.
There is, too, rather a
plethora of castles. It is natural,
of course, for English artists to
paint castles, but one would
suspect from the exhibition at
the Sydney Gallery that Eng-
lish artists, for over a hundred
years, have done little else.
There are grounds for sus-
picion that the selecting
authorities threw in paintings of
castles not because they were
characteristic specimens of some
artist’s work but as a kind of
educational coloring, a historical
flavoring.
The historical lessons, then, of
the exhibition are not difficult
to discover. They are almost
obtrusive. There is a gradual
development and a continuity of
tradition. And, here and there,
one can perceive evidence of the
universal nature of art —its re-
fusal to be limited to any par-
ticular school or period: faintly,
for instance, in Joshua Cristall’s
“Goodrich Castle,” with its
simple design, clear wash,
meticulous drawing and break-
ing of light through the
shadowed valley below the
castle —a clear statement in low
tones. In Cornelius Varley’s
“Ruins of Kerry Castle,” a piece
of sombre magnificence, and in
the rather bizarre watercolors of
Samuel Palmer.
Sydney is obviously indebted
to the Empire Art Loan Society
for the opportunity of seeing
these watercolors. But, without
looking a gift horse too ob-
viously in the mouth, it may be
suggested that it is better to have
the best pictures, representative
of an era in England’s painting ;
and if masters like Turner are
represented it is surely proper
for them to be represented only
by their masterpieces.
"White Horse Inn."
It’s always individuals who
start revolutions —mobs never do
—and if future first-night audi-
ences at His Majesty’s, Mel-
bourne, enjoy the proletarian
privilege of being able to sur-
vey the show in their shirt-
sleeves on heatwave nights with-
out fear of police action by the
ushers, thanks will be due to
the unidentified gent, in the d.c.
front-row seat who, halfway
through the performance, grimly
removed his soup and fish and
displayed a fancy line in sus-
penders.
Within a few minutes half the
males assembled had followed
his example, and the blaze of
colored braces almost dimmed
the sartorial gaiety of the stage
show. This gesture of irrever-
ence may possibly have been
stimulated by the quality or lack
of quality of the production,
which wasn’t the best in the
Firm’s long history.
If the tourists, boatmen, wait-
resses, chambermaids, hotel-
porters, Alpine guides, Tyrolean
cowherds, foresters and what-
not changed their costumes once
they changed them a dozen
times; but they were still the
same old crowd of indifferent
singers in the new rigout as the
old one, and a fresh suit of
clothes didn’t have any observ-
able rejuvenating effect on the
humor of Colin Croft and Fred
Murray.
The lastnamed comedian
made the best joke of the even-
ing when he said at the final
curtain that he “had never
played to a warmer audience.”
"The Die is Cast."
Sydney Variety’s current re-
lease, “The Die Is Cast” (“Les
Jeux Sont Faits”), is the finest
film of Jean Paul Sartre, French
novelist, playwright and father
of the philosophy known as
Existentialism.
On the same day, at the same
hour and in the same city two
young people die, both by
violence — Eve (Micheline
Presle) and Pierre (Marcel Pag-
liero). They do not realise
they are dead until they reach
the “spirit world” and their
names are entered in the books
of the Celestial Registrar (Mar-
guerite Moreno), an extra-
ordinary old woman full of
Gallic humor and shrewdness.
The young couple see a lot of
each other and soon are in love.
They plead with the Registrar
for another chance to live, as
they feel they would have made
admirable partners had they met
on earth.
They are given 24 hours to
prove their love; if it is as
strong as they believe it to be,
they will be allowed to live their
life on earth together. They
return to their former existence
as if they had not died, with the
difference that they now know
each other. The experiment,
however, does not work out
happily, and at the end they are
glad to return to the world of
ghosts.
Sartre’s pessimistic philosophy
is delicately conveyed by the
players, especially Micheline
Presle, a lovely young actress,
and Marcel Pagliero. Of the
others Marguerite Moreno’s con-
tribution is a small masterpiece
of character-acting.
Melbourne had three servings
of the “Messiah” during Christ-
mas, and the third, under Pro-
fessor Heinze’s baton, was
unique in having an aboriginal,
Harold Blair, as tenor.
The young man, whose
meteoric rise from Queensland
cattle-camps to opera and ora-
torio is of the same order as that
of Albert Namatjira from
camel-boy to Australian R.A.,
displayed a light voice with a
pleasing timbre and capable of
considerable expression. It
would have been heard to more
advantage if the Melbourne
Symphony Orchestra hadn’t got
it into its collective head on
several occasions that it was in
competition with him. His clear
diction was the most beautiful
feature of his performance.
None of the other soloists was
outstanding, and the Ormond
Professor seemed to have to do
a lot of flogging before he got
the necessary fierceness and
ardency out of the Melbourne
Philharmonic gentlemen and
ladies. When he did, however, it
came out beautifully in “Unto
Us a Child Is Born.”

Henry
Deacon was an Englishman who, in
1868, found a new method of obtaining chlorine
from hydrochloric acid gas, at that time a by-
product of alkali manufacture. His method, known
as the “Deacon Process,” was eventually used all
over the world. Side by side with another process,
also invented by an English chemist, Deacons
invention mad% possible the commercial production
of chlorine. This important heavy chemical is used
in bleaching, for the manufacture of disinfectants,
cleaning fluids and industrial solvents. Munici-
palities employ it for sterilising water supplies.
Chlorine and its derivatives are essential to the
chemical engineering and textile industries.
Deacon was born in London in 1822. His parents
were extremely poor, but they were fortunate
enjoying the friendship of Michael Faraday. The
scientist took upon himself the supervision of
the boy's brief education at a Quaker school in
Tottenham. He left at the age of H. andL was
aonrenticed to an engineering firm, but soon atte

alass a few years later when offered the manager-
Sp of a small alkali works at Widnes. Sub-
sequently he set up works of his
own in partnership with William
Pilkington and later with Gaskell
—his former employers. He died
of typhoid at the comparatively
early age of 54.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHORT!
AND IT'S
REDMILL RUM.
On New Year’s Day Sydney Show-
ground, not to mention sundry other
irenas, witnessed the sporting spec-
tacle incomprehensible to the Sas-
senach mind of large numbers of
large blokes attired in multicolored
skirts and chucking about with care-
free abandon a variety of objects,
including themselves. Items considered
chuckable seemed to range from tele-
graph poles to sets of ball-and-chain,
and the whole affair was conducted to
the accompaniment of what Samuel
Pepys described as “mighty barbar-
ous music.” Mons were hooted,
dinnas and cannas tossed around;
the lasses twirled through the sword
dance and the laddies through quarts
of Highland dew. Thus does the
wild Scot hurl his defiance at the
oncoming year.
* * * *
In Sydney, the New Year’s racing
kicked off with a Tattersall’s Club fix-
ture at Randwick on Saturday, mam
event being the 12-furlongs Tatter-
sall;s. Club Cup of £2OOO plus orna-
mental mug. The racing was inter-
esting enough, but punters may hope
that results did not truly reflect what
they can expect to meet during the
remainder of the year; one favorite
successful in seven is not an extrava-
gantly profitable percentage.
The surprise performance in the
running of the Cup was that of the
aged Limarch gelding Barnsley,
tackling a distance quite foreign to
him and making a first-rate showing.
While first Except, and later Cape
Neddick, did the -pacemaking, Barns-
ley bowled along very comfortably
in secohd place. He really looked
the winner as they entered the straight
and showed no sign of weakening in
the run home. He was, however, no
doubt partly through unfamiharity
with the journey, fairly outstayed at
the finish by Avalanche. Avalanche
was ridden a perfectly-judged race by
W. Cook, to win by three-parts of a
length. Steady, finishing smartly,
failed by only a nose to edge Barnsley
out of second place.
Although Barnsley is now rising
nine, his effort in the Cup might be
yet worth keeping in mind. He has
won a string of races at Randwick,
mostly over the mile journey, but his
most recent win was at 10 furlongs,
and he may now prefer a longer trip.
There is no reason why Barnsley
should not stay, being a son of
Limarch, who won the A.J.C. St.
Leger and dead-heated with Hall
Mark in the V.R.C. classic.
A six-year-old bay gelding, Aval-
anche is one of the several fairly
good stayers produced by the V.R.C.
Derby and St. Leger winner Hua.
While he may be unlikely to ever
approach the stud record of his sire
Heroic, who headed the list in. Aus-
tralia for seven successive seasons,
Hua last season led Australian-bred
sires with 22 winners, taking 36 races
and over £20,000 in stakes. Ahead
of Hua on the winning sires’ list
were 18 imported stallions, with Mid-
stream (£52,000) and Dhoti (£49,000)
well out in front.
The stud careers of the various
sons of Heroic are making an in-
teresting study. There seems no
thread of consistency running through
their progeny, unless it is a tendency
to speed rather than stamina; and
there are any quantity of exceptions
even to that notion.
Hua, as remarked, has got his
stayers and also such speedsters as
San Domenico. Nuffield, another
Derby winner, has produced some
good-looking stock, many of them
with plenty of speed, but nothing
outstanding or even particularly good
as yet. Pure Gold, who should have
been a stayer, being a full brother
to Hall Mark and to Hall Mark’s
Sister (dam of Murray Stream), was
actually a first-class sprinter, winning
at up to a mile, and at stud has pro-
duced nothing but moderate sprinters.
Royal Step (Heroic-Roseflight) was
not an outstanding racehorse, but has
been much more successful at stud,
siring some good stayers, and above
all that grand mare Flight. Valiant
Chief (Heroic-Cohesion) has produced
a mixed bag, but among them some
fair stayers, with Valcurl easily the
best. Captain Oates (Heroic-La
Bergeronnette) has had only a few
of his get in action, but they include
Gallant Gentleman, winner of some
good races on the flat and currently
the idol of Melbourne jumping en-
thusiasts.
The most disappointing and, for
buyers, the most expensive of Heroic’s
sons at stud has been Ajax. Most of
his get are handsome-lookers, the
majority of them chestnuts; many
have shown brilliant speed, but only
a few have justified the big prices
they commanded at the yearling sales.
One Sydney owner, however, in A. T.
McLauchlan has been lucky in his
buying of the Ajax breed. He secured
the best of them in Magnificent and
another very good one in Mine Host,
who, last week, won Tattersall’s
Club’s Carrington Stakes.
Saddled up again on Saturday, the
second day of the Tatt.’s meeting,
Mine Host was beaten but not
altogether disgraced by Romany King
(A. Podmore) in the seven-furlongs
Flying Handicap. Mine Host was
favorite for the Flying at 5 to 2,
Cragside being next in the betting at
fours. With his considerable advan-
tage in the weights Romany King
(7 7) may have won in any case—
as it was he did so by three lengths—
but Mine Host’s chance .was not
improved by completely missing the
jump, nor that of Cragside by being
driven along in front when there was
on hand such a willing pacemaker as
Mine Host. After dwelling a .t Carrier-
rise Mine Host was hard ridden to
be hot on the heels of Cragside as
they reached the three-furlongs mark,
he had reached the front and Cragside
was well beaten at the distance, but
after that effort under a burden or
9st. Mine Host had nothing in re-
serve to meet Romany King s power-
ful finish. Blue Tulip was third
three lengths behind Mine Host.
Romany King’s success, coming
on top of his failure when favorite
the previous week, was poorly re-
ceived by a section of the crowd.
One gentleman in particularly, giving
forth a magnificent bellowing ol
“Robbers!” looked close to doing a
blood - vessel. One wonders why
people who think thus of the game
find themselves obliged to attend the
races.
The naming of the present crop of
two-year-olds has been generally of
pretty high standard, but one owner
rather missed the bus when he chose
Royal Tour as the name for a Majesty
colt which had its first run in Satur-
day’s Nursery; he finished, inciden-
tally, last. The Nursery was won
quite nicely by the favorite Hesdm
(F. Williams), leading all the way to
beat Corosan and Lord Byron. Hesdin
is a brown Agincourt gelding.
Apparently foresight—sufficient of
it, at any rate, to see that they re
cooking their own goose—is a faculty
with which Sydney bookmakers are
ill-endowed. Bullet-proof hide, how-
ever, is a thing they display m
abundance. There were 10 starters
in the Tattersall’s Club Cup; with
Except favorite at 5 to 2, the books
had Steady, the rank outsider, at 16
to 1. Another bright example noted
on Saturday was the Trial Stakes,
with eight runners; two of them
started at 7 to 1 and four others at
7 to 4, 9 to 2, fives and 11 to 2
respectively.
* * * *
Order of the Day at Flemington
on Saturday appeared to be “Make
every post a winning-post.” Four
of the seven races were won in that
fashion, as is not infrequently the
case when the going is heavy; it is
rather less common to see four
favorites successful in such going.
Dull, wet weather persuaded many
regulars that there were more pleasant
ways of spending New Year’s Day,
and attendance was much on the
light side.
Evidently rain, hail or sunshine
makes little difference to the brilliant
two-year-old Regal Scout, who con-
tinued blithely on his winning way
by annexing the five-furlongs Strad-
broke Stakes —the Kinderscout colt’s
fourth in a row. The • crowd, how-
ever, must have feared that the going
would not suit him; he was allowed
to start at the amazingly good odds
of 5 to 4 on.
Now to be spelled until the
autumn, when, unfortunately, he is
not entered for the juvenile classics,
Regal Scout is a really impressive
colt. He is not one of these tear-
away speedsters who seldom come to
much after they’ve cleaned up the
shorter two-year-old events, but rather
the type that can be ridden along
quietly in midfield to simply domi-
nate the opposition when called upon.
Hunch and Centurion, the only others
for whom there was any money in
the Stradbroke Stakes, filled the
places but were made to look very
cheap.
In the 14-furlongs Bagot Handicap
the crowd witnessed, and the vast
minority possessed of a sense of
humor appreciated, as lovely a bit
of race-stealing as has been seen.
J. Gilmore was the culprit, on the
consistent old staying mare Miss
Prim.
Miss Prim is not normally given
to front-running, which knowledge
no doubt helped hoodwink other
riders in the Bagot. Jumping her
smartly into the lead, Gilmore gently
acquired a lead of three or four
lengths, which the others were quite
content to concede him; then, grab-
bing his chance, he streaked away
to lead by a dozen lengths. At the
mile Miss Prim was eight or ten
lengths clear of Real Guy, himself
nearly as far ahead of Curtain Call,
with the rest lengths further back.
Even after another couple of furlongs
of this farce other riders seemed not
a whit concerned, and by the time
they woke up it was all over bar
the shouting—there was any quantity
of that.
Miss Prim, who had started at
8 to 1, scored by four lengths from
Curtain Call, just pipping Real Guy;
the favorite Kongmeng was fourth,
six lengths further back. As run-
ners returned to scale the mob cut
loose with a tqrrent of abuse and
some pungently-axpressed advice on
horsemanship; unfortunately in their
righteous rage they didn’t give Gil-
more the credit he thoroughly de-
served.
Considered to have been a bit stiff
in a couple of recent defeats, Land
Boy (S. Ralph) started favorite in the
12-furlongs January Handicap for
three-year-olds. His luck changed,
but it \yas a close go. Just when
Land Boy seemed to have the race
well won in the straight, Bartolus
found a late run which it did the
winner much credit to withstand,
the official margin was a half-head—
the photo, showed about a halt-men.
Starting favorite for the six-furlongs
Standish Handicap, the New Zealand-
bred High Play made a jolly good
attempt. However, the country per-
former Chal (P. Simonds), enjoying
a pull of 231 b. in the weights, made
his run at the same time as High
Play, and, going stride by stride with
the favorite over the final furlong,
won by three-parts of a length. Chisel
Beach was third.
Over the same journey another
favorite had better luck when Mag-
netic Vale downed Regular Port ana
Delhi in the Maidstone Handicap.
Winning by a half-head. Magnetic
Vale gave jockey A. Breasley his first
success since resuming after a long
spell. The finish of the 10-furlongs
Highweight Handicap was a thriller,
Merry Edition (G. West), Chilperic,
Dhutia and Stamen finishing in that
order, but with barely a half-neck
between the four. Only five started
in the New Year Hurdle, and favorite
Finentigue (W, Aldridge) led all the
way.
* * * *
In races for the younger horses at
Randwick on Monday, topweights
performed up to the handicapper s
assessment. The Duchess and Favour,
each with 8.12, fought out the six-
furlongs Nursery for two-year-old
fillies, The Duchess winning by three-
parts of a length. By a similar margin
in the Quality (7f.) for three-year-old
fillies Sheba (8.11) defeated Revemr
(8.6) and Midwise (8.9). The Juvenile
Handicap (6f.) saw a magnificent
finish, Nerscot (8.9) winning by a
nose from Hesdin (8.5), with Chitral
(9.2) a nose further back third.
They raced also at Caulfield on
Monday, where early winners were
Maelstrom in the Waratah Hurdle
and •Lady Pirouette in the Berwick
Handicap for two-year-olds.

The number of words already
written about Don Bradman runs
into many millions. It would be
superfluous to add more here, other
than to say what all Australians and
cricketers throughout the world would
wish to say “Congratulations, Sir
Donald!”
* * * *
Another sportsman to bag a knight-
hood in the New Year Honors was
Claude Plowman, Tasmanian marine
engineer, radio-expert and owner-
skipper of the beautiful 64-foot cutter
Morna. An hour or two before the
Honors were announced Morna, with
Plowman at the helm, had crossed
the line first for the third year m
succession in the Sydney-Hobart
yacht race.
With a freak nor’-easter on their
tails nearly all competitors in the
yacht race made fast time. Morna
clocked four days, five hours, one
minute and 25sec. for the 680-mile
journey, knocking 22 hours off her
own record. The winner on handi-
cap, however, for the second year in
succession, was the 41ft. cutter West-
ward.

Sheffield Shield:
A pat on the back for the South
Australians, who are doing their
darndest to raise cricket from the
doldrums; it must be the Bradman
influence. After an unlucky defeat
by N.S.W. the S.A. players clashed
with Queensland at Adelaide in a
ding-dong go. Leading 346 to 288
on the first innings, ‘'South” batsmen
barged headlong into the attack and
rapidly piled up 324 for their second
•knock. Faced with 382 to overtake,
the Queenslanders fell to bits and
managed only 162; a well-deserved
'win for S.A. by 220 runs and with
only four .mimjtes to spare. Urged
on by barrackers, Geoff Noblet (six
for 36) and Dooland (three for 35)
did the mopping-up. Noblet’s 10
for 91 in the match is the best
bowling effort of'the season to date.
South Aus. next tackled Victoria
in Melbourne, where the locals, after
having four down for 56, rallied
somewhat to lift their total to 281.
Noblet again bowled grandly, taking
three for 48, and keeper Langley
helped matters by taking a couple
of brilliant catches and allowing only
two byes. South Aus. had lost one
for 28 at close of play, and on Satur-
day J. Pluvius bowled from both
ends without intermission.
N.S.W. v. Victoria at Melbourne
was an innocuous affair. The Walers
were 147 up on the first innings
(334 to 187), and that was the final
result. In Vic.’s 187 Loxton (60)
and N. Harvey (40) alone offered
any resistance to Lindwall (six tor
44) and Walker (four for 30). After
a deadly dull display N.S.W. closed
their second innings at six for 220,
and, when an appeal against the light
was upheld, Victoria had lost four
for 98.
Friday’s heavy rain played Old
Harry with, the Sydney Cricket
Ground surface for the return N.S.W.
v. Queensland fixture, and when
Morris won the toss on Saturday
he sent the northerners in. It was
early apparent that the dry-looking
top on the wicket was a delusion,
and with accurate bowling five wickets
were soon down for 38 runs. How-
ever, Archer (54), Tallon (49) and
McCool (42) combined to raise the
total to 202. The Walers plodded
along to make 55 fpr two wickets
at stumps.

Jack Read nominates the best scraps
of 1948.:
Fans are still arguing whether Ray
Coleman y. Billy Watson at Leich-
“Now we come to the fifteenth. I planks the pill down like
this, and ”
hardt in September, or Tommy Burns
v. Mickey Tollis at Sydney Stadium
in October was the best fight of the
year. With the Australian welter
title at stake the Burns-Tollis match
was the more important, but Cole-
man and Watson are by a street the
country’s best featherweights and there
was never a dull moment in their
match. . .
Always attacking, Burns beat Tollis
beyond question on points, though
that decision met with a poor recep-
tion. Attack also won for Coleman,
who is now itching for a crack at
the fedder title held by Eddie Miller,
at present in London.
Other 1948 contests that come
easily to mind are Vic. Patrick v.
Tommy Stenhouse at Sydney Stadium
in June, Jack Hassen v. Roy Treasure
(Sydney) in November, Harry Hayes
v. Jackie Daniels (Sydney) and Ken
Bailey v. Bernie Hall, (Leichhardt),
both in December, i
Patrick retired after the Stenhouse
scrap, but he went out a winner.
Hassen impressed by stopping George
Kapeen three weeks prior to meet-
ing Treasure, and, untroubled by his
opponent’s southpaw stance, he de-
feated Treasure on a t.k.o. in the
fourth round. Hayes, an outstanding
contender for Burns’s welter title,
found Daniels’s greater experience
bothersome, but, rising above him-
self, won well on points.
Thought to have retired after draw-
ing with Daniels in November, 1947,
Bailey resumed at Leichhardt a few
months back, and wins over Mahom-
med Donnelly, Norm Gent and Bernie
Hall have him now vying with Hassen
for th,e right to the vacant light-
weight title. Bailey v. Hassen, if it
comes about, may easily be the fight
of 1949.

A Washington “Post’’ correspondent
reports an interesting sidelight on the
recent unsatisfactorily-ending match
between American Lee Savold and
the British titleholder Bruce Wood-
cock, each with an eye on the semi-
vacant world heavyweight title. Stop-
ping a low blow, Woodcock hit the
deck, tenaciously remained there, and
was awarded the fight on a foul.
Gathering the sporting scribes into
his dressing-room after the scrap,
Savold’s manager, Bill Daly, said that
the blow was not low, that in any
case there was no power in it and
that both fighters wore protecting
belts. “I’ll show you what you can
do when you’re wearing one of
those.” Daly turned to Savold and
said, “Get off your dressing-gown and
your trunks.” Savold did so, and his
manager waded into him with both
fists and both feet. “Now, how much
was Woodcock hurt?” asked Daly.

The Exchange Rate
Australia’s sterling funds in
London on December 22, as
shown in the return of the Com-
monwealth Bank, totalled £346.6
million, an increase of £172 mil-
lion compared with a year ago,
and up about £9O million since
June 30. The wool clip’s sale
at record prices, higher prices
for metals and a satisfactory
wheat harvest disposed of at still-
high figures have brought in a
big export income, while lack of
dollar credits has curbed our
rate of total imports.
The growth in our London
funds would normally be a very
encouraging sign, but at the
moment it is to some extent an
indication of deranged trade and
inflated price-levels. Some of
our export income is un-
doubtedly arising from the
premium being paid for wool
by Continental countries resell-
ing to the United States for dol-
lars, whereas direct sales to
America even at a lower price
might be of more advantage to
us—such sales would provide us
with the dollar wherewithal to
import essential raw materials
and so increase production.
The big increase in our Lon-
don funds will certainly raise
the question of exchange-rate
adjustment early in the new year.
Never before have we had such
a large accumulation of sterling
funds. But the end-of-1948 total
of £346.6 million (Australian
currency) is still about £2OO mil-
lion short of Australia’s over-
seas public debt, 'mostly owed
in London. Our building-up of
Loncfon funds becomes less of an
exchange-rate factor the more
the question is considered.
In our particular instance
there is no call for readjustment
merely because of our favorable
balance of trade. The real matter
to be considered is future trade
trends and probable future pro-
duction costs in Australia and
overseas.
In Australia the 40-hour week
is only now getting into its in-
flationary stride, and some of
our apparently low costs are
assuming a different shape as
higher wages and the removal
of price-subsidies have their
effects.
The Australian pound-note
should not be brought to par
with sterling without a full re-
consideration of our taxation
and industrial policy on eco-
nomic, not political, lines. It is
no use raising the external value
of our pound merely in an
attempt to stop inflation in this
country. There must first of all
be evidence that we have over-
come the internal factors caus-
ing inflation before we attempt
to cope with external ones.
Otherwise an apparent fall in
the cost of imported consumer
goods will only defer the time
when the producer must come
face-to-face with himself as a
consumer and realise that most
of his economic troubles are
caused by himself as an inade-
quate producer.
It i§ possible, indeed, that a
reversion of our pound to parity
with sterling would be as un-
timely in the long-run as was
the introduction of the 40-hour
week. If the wage-earner had
responded with higher hourly
production in return for the
shorter working week—as he
could have done quite comfort-
ably—the 40-hour week might
have been a success. The level-
ling of our exchange-rate would
only be successful if it tended to
reduce all costs, not merely the
cost of some consumer goods,
and brought a lighter taxation
burden and induced higher out-
put per man. per hour generally.
Maoriland Housing
Many hundreds of well-to-do
Maorilanders comfortably
settled in State houses are con-
tent to stay there, because—it
pays. At a rent only half of
what they’d have to spend if
they built for themselves at to-
day’s costs and paid today’s out-
size prices for building lots,
they’re saving 30s. a week by
letting the State be their land-
lord. It’s easy living for them
—at the taxpayer’s expense. The
State has skimmed the cream
from .the pool of tenants or
potential home - owners, has
helped a lot who don’t need
“I plead guilty, your Worship. I bin readin' too many of
these kids' comics."
helping because they’re well able
to look after themselves but are
losing sturdy independence, and
is pushing ahead with another of
its socialistic schemes to con-
vert Maorilanders into State de-
pendants. Traditional M.L. love
of the freehold still lives on, but
it’s far from universal now.
How much does the taxpayer
have to fork out to help house
the other fellow who is today a
subsidised State tenant? On the
27,000-odd houses let by the
State since March, 1937, when
the scheme kicked off, the tax-
payer is hit for at least £40,500
a week, or well over £2,000,000
a year. Rents average 275. 6d.
a week. Expert valuers and
builders estimate the average cost
of a State house when tenants
step in is not less than £2400. A
fair rental, based on the formula
under the Fair Rents Act, is
figured out at £2 15s. to £3
weekly ; that is, double what the
tenant pays. There are larger
State houses, for families of five,
or more, where the figures are
higher and the margin wider.
As more State houses are
built at today’s inflated costs the
load on the taxpayer’s shoulders
is growing at a rate undreamed
of when the scheme was in its
infancy. Rents, for new houses
must be on a level with those
occupied for years past or spoon-
fed Maorilanders will grumble,
so the loss per house looks like
reaching £lOO a year before long
for every roof, or a million for
every 10,000 houses. Maori-
landers who have to foot the
bill, although it’s hidden away
in departmental files, are asking
if there’s a breaking-point, and
if so, where? Shrewd observers
don’t expect any change before
the next election, at the end of
1949, but the reckoning-day
won’t be easier for- being de-
layed.
Observers from abroad have
been puzzled about N.Z. State-
house finance and the standard
of homes, which they admit is
high. Taxes are the answer.
Thousands are in queues waiting
for M.L. “Labor” planners and
financial’ wizards to build faster,
but, with the red light showing,
the pace is more likely to be
slower. State housing has slipped
a good deal since 1940, when
State-built homes outnumbered
private; today private houses
going up are two-to-one against
State, and the swing will go
further.
Lead and Spelter
For the first time since price-
control came into operation in
Australia a rise in the domestic-
consumption price of lead and
spelter from the fixed £22 a ton
has been permitted. From
January 1 lead will cost the Aus-
tralian consumer £35 a ton,
spelter £4O a ton. Australia
consumes 25 p.c. of its lead out-
put and 45-50 p.c. of its zinc
production. It appears that
North Broken Hill, Broken Hill
South, Zinc Corp., Electrolytic
Zinc and Mt. Isa will comprise
the pool which will supply the
home market at a price still
reckoned to be below cost of
production. The Lake George
co. will be allowed to export all
its production in view of its
high costs and low grade. In
London lead sells for £153 Aust.,
spelter for £ll5 a ton.
Associated Leathers
An important group of Aus-
tralian and Maoriland leather
cos. will be merged under control
of the new holding concern,
Associated Leathers, Ltd., regis-
tered in .Melbourne with
£2,500,000 nominal capital.
Biggest and oldest member of
the group is the 84-year-old
Michaelis Hallenstein and Co.
Pty., of Melbourne. The other
four are Farleigh Nettheim Pty.,
of Sydney; Farleigh Nettheim
(Q’land) Pty.; Rosenstamm’s, of
Perth, and Glendermid’s, of
Dunedin, N.Z. All operate on
similar lines, having tanneries
and warehouses which handle
leather, grindery, saddlery and
canvas, and a number of their
subsidiaries turn out sports-
goods and other finished pro-
ducts.
Associated Leathers will ac-
quire the five proprietaries by. an
exchange of scrip, which is ex-
pected to involve it in an issue
of about £910,000 ordinary stock
fin 10s. units), plus £196,000 pref.
stock (£1 units). Afterwards it
is proposed that Associated
Leathers shareholders will sell
enough of their scrip to permit
’Change listing and taxation on
a “public co.” basis. Terms of
the placement haven’t yet been
indicated ; it is to be carried out
privately by R. A. Rowe and Co.
and J. T. Vinton Smith.
Archie Michaelis, M.L.A., is
the first chairman of Associated
Leathers, and, besides three other
members of the Michaelis family,
the board includes C. H. Dodds,
J. C. Farleigh and H. L. Long-
bottom.
Creeping paralysis has afflicted
gold cos. in Maoriland, and to-
day the industry is nearly pros-
trate under the “new-look”
pound, which cut the price for
gold from £lO 15s. to £8 12s.
an ounce. N.Z.’s most famous
old mine at Waihi, owned by
the Martha Gold Co., is in the
last stages of life as operations
are narrowed down to top-grade
ore before the end comes. Ap-
peals for State assistance to
cover the drop in price and the
rise in costs, as underground
hours are reduced from 40 to
35 weekly, got nowhere, so the
co. has to write off big areas of
low-grade ore now unpayable.
Silver is down from ss. sd. to
4s. 4d. an ounce. Total bullion
values on M.L.’s new-currency
basis are cut by at least £70,000
annually. A dredging concern,
Taramakan, is closing down
until the gold price rises or costs
fail. . •
* * * *
British interests have made an
offer to New Zealand Industries,
Ltd., one of the Fletcher group
of cos., to buy out the business
from individual shareholders.
Knight James Fletcher, chair-
man, started the ball rolling on
his London visit late last year.
His recommendation to share-
holders to accept will be sup-
ported by directors at an extra-
ordinary meeting within a few
weeks. Since it got going in
1945 the co. has paid one 6 p.c.
and two 8 p.c. divs. and has ex-
panded paid capital to half the
authorised total of £lOO,OOO.
Litigation in 1947 and 1948, due
to the co.’s action in cancelling
a contract with the general dis-
tributors of its products, was
fairly costly, but output has
been moving in the right direc-
tion. Sales-talk began when
M.L.’s revalued pound put a
different complexion on the
future, although the co. wasn’t
downhearted about prospects.
With the share-register closed
until January 31, shareholders
have ample time to make up
their minds.

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
From the Londoner’s point
of view, 1948 slips into the
cupboard of recollection with
reluctance; the mind tends to
linger over some of the experi-
ences in the flash-back of events.
It was a better-balanced year
than either 1946 or 1947.
In general, the strain of the
war years punished those who
stayed at home more severely
than those who wore service uni-
form. But demobilisation united
both classes of defender in a
common desire to settle down in
peace and quiet, to work, to re-
lax and to watch the reconstruc-
tion of their battered city.
Nineteen forty-six proved to be
a year of disillusionment, 1947
a year of frustration. Both are
gladly forgotten.
While there is neither reason
nor evidence to hope that world
events promise well, public
understanding of the hazards and
threats is wider and more real.
It is natural for human hearts
to believe that their suffering,
resolution and high endeavor
will ultimately earn rewards of
peace and security and content-
ment. There have been no such
rewards. Instead, the European
scene has worsened. When the
war-dust settled over Europe’s
wide battlefields a new danger
was seen to be suspect. For
many long months British
people were reluctant to acknow-
ledge that the men who rule
Soviet Russia sought power and
dominance beyond their iron
curtain. They still hoped that
an amicable solution might be
found, even though these hopes
were clouded with doubt. The
march of events in 1948 has
established that the doubts were
right after all, and that if the
Soviet rulers halt in their steps
it will not be because they are
gentle, kind and reasonable men.
That the world should not
have learned better, after, two
terrible wars in half a lifetime,
is a sorrowful thought; but it is
also a chastening one. To shud-
der daily at the sight of the
headlines ini the morning paper
is not to live at all, except by
escaping into fantasy.
There are signs that the mood
of the British people has become
more composed during 1948. Be-
cause they are more at grips with
realities, however unpleasant,
their temper is keener and their
enjoyment more full. Despite
considerable political bewilder-
ment, there is altogether a firmer
sense of being together. It is as
though they were beginning to
say to themselves: “Life’s
pretty grim, but let’s get on with
it and face-facts.”
Retrospect: General
Normal daily life seems to
have been slightly easier during
the past year. Bread and pota-
toes —always a harsh reminder
of the post-war deterioration in
food supplies—came off the
ration with no regrets. If meat
is no more plentiful and bacon
scarce to rarity, there has been
a greater variety of food in the
shops. That overtried warrior
the housewife is less tired. She
has been able to rely upon regu-
lar, if infrequent, offal; and
since fish, game and rabbits
have made their appearance on
the counter she has been relieved
of much wearying queueing.
Taxation on tobacco and
alcoholic drinks has surely
reached its limit. When a man
cannot be a moderate drinker
unless he is also a heavy
spender, a pint of beer becomes
something of a luxury, while a
nip of whisky, if obtainable,
seems an extravagance suitable
only for a very special occasion
or for the businessman who has
a generous expense allowance.
Willy-nilly, the nation is forced
into sobriety. Tobacco-smoking,
on the other hand, does not de-
cline, though cigarettes are
scarce and cost 3s. 6d. for 20.
There are more goods in the
shops and, significantly, less
money in the pockets of shop-
pers. The buying of clothes is
governed by lack of money
rather than by shortage of cou-
pons. Consequently, with the
seller’s market on the decline, the
forgotten arts of salesmanship
give signs of revival.
The weather, which in early
1947 played havoc with the
nation’s comfort, and with its
economy, has been indulgent.
The winter of 1947-48 was mild,
and late-1948 astonishingly so;
even the gales were tempered
with warmth. The summer
ruined most people’s holidays,
but mercifully withheld its damp
fury during critical periods of
the Olympic Games and the
Tests. It was a concession that
was a thankful relief to an em-
barrassed host.
The Games authorities had
difficulties enough, especially in
finding accommodation and,
later, in satisfying many of the
competitors that it was the best
that could be found —in all the
circumstances a very good best.
While the financial success of
the Tests was never in doubt,
bookings for the Games at first
were poor. Popular interest and
record attendances were last-
minute reactions and full com-
pensation for a fine job of
organisation. Tactful handling
reduced potential clashes of
temperament and nationality to’
a few trivial incidents.
And, of course, England didn’t
do very well either in the Tests
or the Games. Many reasons
and excuses have been put for-
ward, but none truer than that
she was outplayed and outpaced.
Dental and Medical
July 5, 1948, was the date on
which the much - vaunted
National Health Service came
into being. The scheme was not
the idea of the present Govern-
ment, although Mr. “Nye”
Bevan, Minister of Health, has
the credit for seeing the Bill on
to the Statute Book. Unlike
Duncan’s assassination, ’twere
well it were done cautiously, in-
stead of quickly. Perhaps in a
year’s time, when the doctors,
dentists, chemists and opticians
have applied their professional
skill and sagacity to clearing up
the financial jumble and anoma-
lies, more favorable comment
may be possible, Meanwhile, it
is enough to say that legislation
alone cannot provide the service
it aims at.
The dentists have attracted a
good deal of attention to them-
selves by the vast sums of money
they are causing to be debited
to the Government’s (and the
taxpayers’) account. It is fair
to say that the new scale of
fees is due neither to them nor
to the Minister of Health, but
to the Spens Committee, whose
generous suggestions astonished
even the dentists. Private prac-
tice has proved so lucrative that
dentists in the service of schools
are being drawn away. Their
natural disinclination to be de-
prived of a chance to “have a
go” is thus defeating one of the
purposes of the Act, which is to
make the service accessible to
all. The present annual cost to
the nation is estimated to be'
about £50,000,000 ; the estimate
allowed £7,000,000.
Doctors are pnjoying less of
a hayride. The work of all
general practitioners is ham-
pered by crowded surgeries, so
that they are unable to give
proper attention to the more
serious cases. One G.P. was
heard to say: “Before July,
people came to me when they
were ill. Now they come if they
think they are going to have a
cold!” J
If there is one important
moral to be drawn it is that, in
any project, the respect of all
sides should be won. Certainly
much heavy expense might have
been avoided had Mr. Bevan
learned this elementary lesson.
Doctors can have a sense of
humor as well as a sense of re-
sponsibility. “You asked for it,
chum. Now you’re going to get
it!” is the reaction. Prescrip-
tions are written —and what
prescriptions! Too general, too
frequent and too generous. The
doctor loses nothing, nor does
the chemist; least of all does
the patient. The Minister of
Health has effectively passed
the baby into the hands of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Maoriland Dairying.
“New Zealand should sell its
exports at world levels” is the
latest battl'e-cry of Maoriland
producers, sounded by W. E.
Hale, chairman of the world’s
biggest butter-exporting co., the
Auckland Farmers’ Freezing Co.
A.F.C. shipped nearly 4±
million boxes of butter last
season from the Auckland Pro-
vince, the world’s greatest dairy-
farm, and Hale claims there are
“vast possibilities” of further
expansion if the Government
gets behind producers. But
M.L. farmers will go slowly if
Britain expects them to be satis-
fied much longer with prices well
below those paid to the Danes
or Argentinians. The argument
concerns Australia, too, for
both Dominions are in the same
boat for exports, but feeling is
stronger in M.L. because its
pound is now level with sterling
again.
This is the line of argument:
If N.Z. and Denmark buy im-
ported goods at world levels,
these levels are good enough for
both to sell at. N.Z.’s cow
population has dropped by
100,000 since 1941, and in the
six years before that the drop
was 50,000 —a loss of 150,000 in
13 years. The Danes can’t be
blamed for all this, or even most
of it, but Maoriland cow-
spankers remember their butter
was once running nearly neck
and neck with Danish in Britain.
It’s just as good now, but it’s
harder to produce, because the
40-hour week and high city
wages have lured workers away
from the country. Men won’t
go back to the farms while the
balance is tilted in favor of the
towns, so wages are a touchy
topic with farmers today. Of
course, wage-earners are the
main army of voters, so farmers
are crying in the wilderness.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Jindivick”: “The fogs we get around
this place,” said Joe, “are a real menace.
Last winter I’m out trapping around the
lake when one comes down. Luckily I’d
set all the traps except half a dozen, so
I put them down in a hurry and sets out
in a line which should carry me up the
rise and home. I’m walking for a long
while, dead silent, can’t see a hand in
front of me, when a breeze come up and
I step into nothing and drop after fifty
feet into the lake. When I gets to the
shore I take a wake-up to what’s hap-
pened. Y’ see, after I put me traps down
and started to walk in the direction I
thought was uphill, I was being misled
by the fog that was sticking to me boots —
snowballing on the soles and lifting me
higher and higher, making me think I’m
walking uphill when really I’m walking
out over the lake. I found me last six
traps lying in a row on top of the ground
—l’d dug them into the fog, and all I’d
caught was one lost shag and a magpie! ”
* * * *
“Bfil E.”: Those naturally excellent
stockmen, the aboriginals in the Northern
Territory, have gone into the cattle-
breeding industry on their own account.
From the Bluff and Areyongs area they
are participating in a scheme under which
the Board of Management sets them up
with stock. The board may approve of
sales to markets, members of the associa-
tion or to an outsider, provided his nearest
boundary is not less than 80 miles away
from the boundary of the aboriginal
reserve. Indications are that the scheme,
designed primarily to throw the abos on
their own initiative and resources as well
as giving them a feeling of independence
through productive effort, has more than
a good chance of succeeding.
* * * *
“Mat’s Mate”: We got into Mary-
borough (Vic.) for the Highland festival
one New Year’s eve, and about the first
thing that happened to us was a clan or
a tribe or something of Scotsmen in tartan
skirts who invaded the pub billiard-room
where we had bunks and insisted on play-
ing chanters and practising sword-dances,
with frequent intervals for refreshment.
By midnight the noise was so great that
the publican came to protest. The Scots
repelled him. He called his brother, who
was captured and held as a hostage until
the publican ransomed him with liquid
assets. About all I remember after that
is a haggis with hairy legs pushing me
through a window. I awoke on New
Year morning in a bed of nasturtiums,
and there, gravely eyeing me, was a large
figure in sporran and kilts, a black
velvet jacket with a broad tartan sash
and Mat’s face. “Howinell,” .1 de-
manded, “didya get dolled up like that?”
“Damfino,” he confessed. “I turned in
an’ then missed you, so I turned out
again, grabbed me clobber an’ started
lookin’ for y\ What’s got me worried
is that some blanky Scotchman is runnin’
round Maryborough in my new suit, an’
I got t’ wear this rigout till I find him.
I bin laughed at be the boots an’ two
kitchen-maids, so don’t you start.” It
turned out that the Scot wearing Mat’s
suit had woke up, thought he’d forgotten
to wear his national rig and had headed
out to Avoca, 25 miles away, to get it.
Catching him and getting both rehabili-
tated in their proper garments nearly
wrecked the day’s programme.
* * * *
“Flapjack”: Working for a bachelor
cocky, I had to go over the bare patches
made by a band of about 30 marauding
blue-jays which played havoc with the
first tender shoots of the maize. Know-
ing that if one is wounded the others will
come close to inspect the victim, I de-
cided to use the .22 repeater one Sunday.
The cocky was so used to solitude he
never even asked where I was going. The
ruse was successful, and I settled every
one of those pirates. Nothing was said
for three or four days, when suddenly
the cocky presented me .with my time.
Asking him the reason, he said “I won-
dered what all the shootin’ was for last
Sundey. Now you’ve gone and shot all
me blanky blue-jays. Don’t yer think it’s
quiet enough without doing away with
the only little bit of noise and excitement
I get?” The publican told me the cocky
had for years been threatening to kill the
jays every time he came to the pub, but
never attempted to when sober.
* * * *
“Bo”: Bartlett had unsuccessfully tried
to get some fencing done by contract, so
perforce had to get the holes dug by day-
labor. The two fellows he hired, one
short and fat and the other a long thin
cove, found the going hard in the dry,
shaly ground. When Bartlett came to
inspect after the first couple of days he
condemned the shallowness of the holes
and stipulated that they’d have to go
down at least another 18in. The pair
scraped a fey/ more inches out at the rate
of about an hour an inch. A few days
later the owner again showed up for an
inspection. When he got within a few
yards of them Bartlett was horrified to
see the long bloke, who had been bend-
ing over one of the holes, suddenly keel
oyer. His mate rushed across and, lifting
his head on his lap, began to fan him
vigorously with his hat. Bartlett hurried
over. “What was it?” he inquired
anxiously. “Is he ill?” Nugget looked
up. “Aw, it’s nothin’,” he said. “But he
keeps chuckin’ these doublers every time
he looks down one o’ them holes y’
wanted made deeper—some blokes get
like that from lookin’ down from heights
—vertigo, they call it.”

“Blime”: It was in a little town on
the upper Loddon that I ran into Bob
Jackson. He was collecting jumbucks
round the shanties in the single street, and
“Stop stoking , down there; she's run aground !”
I watched his Border Collie working. The
dog eyed a few near-stragglers, left them
there, and went on to look at a bunch on
a vacant allotment. Bob sat his nag and
waited. Presently the dog returned with
a mob, Bob counted them, and they
moved off up the road. Must have been
about 12 months later that I struck Bob
again retrieving jumbucks from the town
road. The same ring-necked dog was on
the job. He answered Bob’s whistle
readily and dived after a bunch of
woollies, eyed them a second, then, in-
stead of bringing them, chased them off
in the other direction. “Aw, fetch ’em,
y’ silly cow,” came Bob’s roar. “Go
’way there.” The Border went, came on
another small bunch and added them to
the mob heading in a dust cloud for
the horizon. Spilling curses, Bob started
in pursuit. Twenty minutes later he was
still struggling with the dog’s conflicting
ideas. “Cripes, a sheep-dog’s got a single-
track mind, awright,” he remarked as
he passed me. “Can’t tell the cows no-
thin’. You take a lesson from me,
mate,” he advised solemnly, “an’ never
change y’r sheep-brand!”

“Colonial Cove”: Fascinated by
“S. Gums’s” persistent idea of the good
time allegedly had by the old ticket-o’-
leave man, particularly when returned to
partake further of the Queen’s hospitality
(B. 20/10/’4B), I turned to Kimberley’s
History of Western Australia, a work
written for the W.A. Government of the
’nineties, which contains a report of
the convict system based on evidence
given before a Royal Comrafission sitting
in London early in the ’sixties. First, the
ticket-o’-leave didn’t have “usually £1 a
month” —he h'ad to take what wages
offered, if only five shillings. Refusal to
do so was regarded as recalcitrance, and
meant a prompt return to the Fremantle
“college.” A convict’s day in the “col-
lege” started at 5 a.m. in summer, with
the lag making his bed and then scrub-
bing his stone cell floor. Then a wash
and devotions. From 6 a.m. to 8 aun.
he wielded'a hammer on the stone-heaps
—then breakfast, taken in his own cell.
At 9 a.m. the real day’s work began,
which continued, with a break for lunch,
until 5.30 p.m. Good-conduct men were
allowed a light until one hour after sun-
set, the first punishment for misconduct
being the forfeiting of this privilege.
Under those circumstances it is scarcely
likely that an old convict would prefer a
return to “college” to divulging the secret
of a goldmine.

“Bernie”: 1 was giving my neighbor
a hand to load his usual ton of pumpkins
on his lOcwt. utility. As the bags were
more numerous on the right- than the
left-hand side, I pointed out that the
load, being so unbalanced, would be
dangerous. “Aw, that will be 0.k.,
Bernie,” said he. “The slope in the road
will balance it.”

“8.A.”: The Tasmanian “tiger” is not
the only carnivorous marsupial in the
world (B. 15/12/’4B). The so-called Tas-
manian “devil” and the large native cat,
which are found in the same type of
country as the thylacine, are both car-
nivorous. The native cats of the main-
land and New Guinea and the adjacent
islands are also carnivorous, and, to go
farther afield, the American possums,
distributed from the United States to
Patagonia, are meat-eaters, with the ex-
ception of the ichthyophagous yapok, or
water-opossum of Brazil, an animal re-
sembling the otter in general appearance.
I once spent a couple of years on the
west coast of Tasmania, and as the thy-
lacine was common then I had ample
opportunity of seeing him in action. Far
from attempting to “ignore the worrying
•dog” when overtaken, he met,, his pur-
suer with a barrage of vicious snaps,
though it showed no inclination to close
with him. This style of fighting enabled
him to hold the dog off for a time, but
when the infuriated tyke got to close
quarters he had no difficulty in securing
the stranglehold that ended the fight.
* * * *
“Propalong”: I was alone in thick
scrub country when, as a nipper, I shot
my first snake. I marched off home eaten
up with pride, but with scared glances
back over my shoulder. By the time the
house came in sight that perfectly
ordinary sft. brown had assumed the
dimensions of an anaconda, and, after
making the necessary announcements, I
screwed up courage to return for its in-
comparable pelt. I still remember how
my feet went slower and slower through
the sand as I wound through the banksias
nearer and nearer to the fatal spot. And
my front teeth are permanently bent
from the impact of my heart when a
bronzewing flew up when only 10 yards
of bush separated me from the corpse.
Even when the skinning had been ac-
complished the journey home was marked
by a series of spasmodic leaps that would
have reflected credit on a brumby, colt-
each leap being initiated by a real or
fancied rustle in the undergrowth. Now,
10 miles from here there’s a station
homestead that is favored by the presence
of a tomcat who is death on snakes. Big
or little, any reptile that invades the pre-
cincts of the house i§ dead meat as soon
as Sandy gets on its wheel. But for, days
after each victory the big feline is as
nervous as a bat-haunted flapper. A
rustle in the bindi-eye, a sudden move-
ment as a man flicks away a match stick,
a saddle-strap dragged suddenly along
the ground—and Sandy is arched on top
of the nearest post, fur up, eyes blazing,
every taut muscle trembling. That cat
has as much imagination as I have; if
he could speak he’d have started a re-
ligion of sorts before this.

“P.J.A.”: Curious about the noise
going on at the back of the pub, I investi-
gated. Wong, the Chinese cook, was out-
side the kitchen with half a dozen abos
down for the rodeo grouped about him.
Wong was saying ‘What you t’ink I t’ink
now? X pay even money you say right
t’ing.” Jacky spoke up “You t’ink motor-
car?” “No,” said Wong. “Maybe
horse,” guessed Tiger. “No.” “Rodeo,”
Jimmy hoped. “No,” and so on round the
mob, and each time an abo. “guessed
wrong” he paid over his bet. To keep
them coming Wong granted one correct
guess in about 10, and when I left he was
starting another round: “Fi’-bob this
time. What you t’ink I t’ink now?”
* * * *
“E.”: For some time Mum had been
off-color, then one day Dad came in to
find no dinner ready, and the bush nurse
in possession. “Acute appendicitis, I’m
afraid, Mr. Wilson,” the bustling nurse
informed him. “That means a doctor, you
know. It will have to come out.” Dad
pondered the matter solemnly. “Acute,
eh? Sounds pretty serious, nurse. Some
folks dies frpm them things when they
gets caught sudden like that, don’t they?”
“My word they do!” The old bloke con-
sidered again for a bit. “H’m. It’ll
prob’ly mean a trip inter town,” he de-
cided. “Poor ol’ Mum, eh? Awright,
soon’s I get the shearin’ an’ dippin’ over
I’ll take her in in the truck. Don’t care
if I even have to make it a special trip.
Soon’s ever I get the ewes fixed, an’ the
crop in O’ course, that’s if the lambs
is awright, an’ don’t need dosin’ be then.”
* * * *
“Con D. Mine”: “Curate’s Egg” is a
bit astray when he says that the body
of the Boorara murder victim (B.
24/11 /’4B) was reduced to a fine powder
on a pyre of mulga, “fiercest burning of all
bush fuels.” The detectives recovered a
charred bone from the bottom of the
bore which was identified as part of the
femur. It was this and other bones which
led to the conviction of the murderer.
The C. 1.8. men didn’t toil in the shim-
mering heat to rig and insert a sand-
pump ; the plant was already equipped
with one, and it was the murderer him-
self who operated it when it brought the
remains to the surface.
* * * *
“Zake”: There still is no more sturdy
belief beyond the pavement’s end than
the one that the bluebag is the perfect
anodyne for the bee-sting. The magic,
apparently, lies in the vivid color, and I
have seen it applied to the victims with-
out anyone bothering to even extract the
sting. It is too often overlooked that the
poison lies in the hollow of the sting itself,
and that this shouldn’t be pulled but
should be scraped out —a razor-blade is
the ideal instrument. That grand old
stand-by, eucalyptus, or even the homely
ammonia, may be less spectacular than
the bluebag, but is far more efficient
when the Ligurian lets go with its rapier.
* * * *
“W.R.0.”: The Gympie single-hand
hammer certainly was not five to seven
pounds (B. 8/12/’4B). The Victorian
double-hand tool was only eight. The
most popular weight was three and a
half to four pounds. The weight of the
hammer bore little direct relationship to
the speed of boring—correctly-sharpened
steel and accurate drill-turning being the
essentials. A drill can’t be forced
through rock by sheer weight or strength.
My dad punched steel on Gympie and
many other Queensland fields and in
Westralia and was never beaten. In Kal-
goorlie, Victorians, working double-
handed, affected to despise the single-
hand man. One pair, of high repute as
hammersmen, began a hole on the same
shift as the dad, both he and they using
inch steel. As the holes deepened the
easy contempt changed to grim deter-
mination and finally to chagrined dis-
gust. Flinging his hammer down, 14
stone of savage Victorian made for the
shaft and would not be dissuaded. “When
one explosive man can beat two it’s time
to quit,” he snapped. And quit he did.
“With five-eighth steel against their inch
steel and with Bobby Stack to sharpen for
me,” the old chap boasts, “I’d guarantee
to beat any double-hand pair in Aus-
tralia.” My father-in-law, also a knight
of the underground up Herberton way,
supports his views. “It’s all in the turn-
ing,” he says. “Anyone can bump down
a three-cornered hole.” Incidentally, in
competitions on the tinfields, handicaps
were always measured in inches, not in
seconds. All competitors, beginning to-
gether, slugged away for the full period.
Each hole was then measured for depth
and bore with a perfectly cylindrical rod.
The aftermath of such contests was often
more entertaining than the matches them-
selves, and, possibly, a dearth of handi-
cappers may account for their discon- i
tinuance. Mortality rate among these
herp.es must have been high.
A MALLEE SANCTUARY.
Deeply encircled by this arid land,
There is a lonely, blue, breeze-shadowed lake,
Where ripples dance with sunlight to a band
Of bird-calls. Ringed by ancient gums that slake
Their summer thirst at its cool brink and stand
Untired by centuries, its depths provide
A sanctuary where dabbling cygnets play
Untroubled and their graceful elders glide
In sombre dignity. Passing each day
To restless towns, the silver ’planes flash high,
Leaving unsullied by their droning flight
A peace for which the worried world might sigh.
Blue ripples darken and a distant bight
Glows golden as the lengthening sunbeams lie
Athwart its ragged gums. As day greets night
With dusky fingers, stately swans drift by
To reedy nests, and soon a cold, white moon
Slips from the grasping scrub to the clear sky
And keeps her watch above a still lagoon.
VICTORIA.

“Solitude”: Seventyfiver had been talk-
ing so much about the little peach-tree on
the old homestead site that I began anti-
cipating juicy half-pounders by the
bucketful. “Been watchin’ ’em for
weeks,” he chuckled. “I’ll get ’em t’day.”
That night I eyed the little green bullets
in his saddle-bag and nobly refrained
from comment. “Bet they’ll be good
cooked,” he decided, tipping some into
the camp-oven and adding a lump of fat
and pinch of sugar. Twenty minutes
later he declared them “near enough, ’
tasted the nauseous-looking result and
generously shovelled three parts of it on
to my plate. I waded in. The things were
sour as lemons, bitter as strychnine, and
horrible as an income-tax assessment. I
swallowed a bit, chased it with a mouthful
of bread, and paused anxiously to see if
my stomach would stand it. ‘ Not often
y’ get a good feed o’ fruit, Sol,” the old
chap commented. “Uh.” “Bet the
birds’ll be narked.” “Huh!” I
risked another taste, shuddered violently,
and roped in enough courage to suggest
they should have been left on the tree
another couple of months. “Aw, don’t
be so blasted unreasonable, Sol,” came
the old bloke’s protest. “Gripes, if I’d
left ’em till they tasted diff’rent, some-
thing would ’a’ been sure to ’a’ took em.”
* * * *
“Lawnstob”: How’s this for feminine
prowess? The twin 15-year-old daughters
of a Tassie north-east-coast bushman,
Rosalie and Barbara Johnson, sawed
through a 14in. log in 31 seconds, using
a 6ft. 6in. double-handed saw at the Lily-
dale area school show. The two hefty
youths who beat them had a handicap on
them of five seconds.
* * * *
“Old-timer”: The night was hot and
humid, and when Jock fit the lamp a
cloud of variegated flying things swarmed
through windows and door and proceeded
to hold fatal revels around the light.
Jock was trying to read, and he smote and
swished, what time flying-ants invaded
his ears and beetles got down the neck
of his shirt. Presently he arose with a
curse, threw the paper aside and retreated
into an unlit corner of the hut, whence
he surveyed the carnival at the light with
morose interest. He was calmly smok-
ing a final pipe before turning in when a
couple of thumps hit the iron roof asd
something slithered to the ground out-
side. Jock armed himself with a trap-
setter, went out and found his dog ex-
amining the remains of two black ducks.
Ever since that he’s expounded a theory
that fight attracts all winged things, treats
with scorn any suggestion that the ducks
thought the gleaming roof was water and
landed on it, and is dabbling with an in-
vention to set up light-traps in the Boga
swamps and supply the city markets with
poultry.
* * * *
“Stardrift”: Time was when I was
rather sceptical of the ornithological exac-
titude of the title of one of those song-hits
that infest the air, “Walking through the
park I heard a lark bark.” Now I have
definite proof that larks are canine. Riding
through a crop of meadow-hay near
Tennant Creek, my nag put its left
front paw fair on top of a big father
lark. The yelp as the lark sank its molars
into the prad’s ankle blended with my
squawk as I hit the deck and sounded
like the opening bars of “An Airedale
Sang in Berkeley Square.” Further in-
vestigation disclosed that the lark had
nested, and was raising its four pups in
the depression left by,the iron-clad hoof
of a fast-landing seagull.

“D.R.H.”: Effective tactics are adopted
by the rock lizard, alias spiny-tailed slank,
alias Egernia stokesil, when liberty or
fife is threatened. Though inclined to
corpulence, the little fellow, who is
yellowish-brown with a small, triangular
head, will, if captured, droop his forepaws
against his chest in the attitude of a beg-
ging dog and spread his hind-scrapers
helplessly apart. Though entirely without
viciousness, he is heavily armored, each
of the scales on his back terminating in
short, stout spines. His flat little tail with
its V-point is only 2in. or 3in. long, and
is covered with long, hard, needle-pointed
spines. When threatened he runs in a
series of swoops, as though he were trying
to fly. His flight usually ends with a dive
between two rocks just far enough apart
to admit him. Arrived in sanctuary, he
twists his body to bring as big an area
as possible against the stone and flattens
his spiny tail against the rock. With his
sturdy muscles set and his innumerable
anchors out, and biting into every irregu-
larity in the stone, he’s there to stay. If
you want him you must shift the boulders.

“K.W.R.”: For middle-distances my
money is on the racehorse-goanna as our
fastest native, but for the short sprint the
brown snake of the inland (Demansia
texilis) will take some beating. Averag-
ing around sft. in length, and occasion-
ally thicker than the more common,
“ Don't try to do everything at once!”
reddish-hued mulga snake of W.Q., this
reptile is among the most dangerous and
deadly of the dry-country snakes. Muster-
ing a blue-grass flat near the Balonne
(s.-w. Q.) during the mating season, I
disturbed a pair beside a hollow log, into
which one immediately disappeared. The
other was soon dispatched, and four
hours later two of us returned to the
scene. Rolling the log back and forth,
ramming a stick in and puffing smoke
through, all failed to coax the reptile out,
and we’d given him best when I noticed
an angry shape, body flattened to strike,
tongue darting, as it emerged. Both of
us were watching the opening, both had
sticks raised to kill, but that snake had
travelled a measured 12ft. before our
sticks could descend.

“Spinet”: An old showman’s trick in
nail-driving (B. 8/12/’4B) was to offer
an apparently solid block of wood, but
which had a sheet of metal inserted. Into
one corner, free of metal, the showman
drove his own nails, but nobody else had
much chance of winning a box of choco-
lates.
* * * *
“Trim”: A man has to be pretty smart
to be a good auctioneer, although luck
goes a long way towards making things
easier. Shaggy had just got his auc-
tioneer’s licence when he was sent out to
his first assignment, an “in conjunction”
clearing sale of dairy-cattle, plant, etc.
The conjoining firms were bitter rivals,
“Up you get , Clara; We've slept in.”
and it was a matter of vital importance
as to who topped the sale for dairy-cows.
His boss took sick on the morning of
the sale, and the whole burden of the
firm’s prestige rested on Shaggy. There
were 120 dairy-cows to be sold, and
it was agreed that each firm sell 20
alternately, so that neither gained the ad-
vantage of the best cows being sold first
nor was handicapped by a glutted mar-
ket. The opposition won the toss and
began selling. Shaggy was sitting on
the rails when an old cocky said to
him, “Got tons of feed going to waste
—not enough cows —would buy a dozen
here today if I could raise the finance.
Cows could be bought on terms, the ven-
dor financing purchasers through the
auctioneers, so it was no immediate con-
cern of Shaggy’s as to whether or not the
cocky was a good risk. Shaggy told him
that his firm would lend the cash, but,
as it was Shaggy’s firm doing the lending,
it would be right and proper for the
cocky to buy the cows only when Shaggy
was selling. The cocky readily agreed.
When it was Shaggy’s turn to sell he
went into the ring and immediately raised
the bids from five to 10 bob a time. He
used the old cocky only when absolutely
necessary, but to such good purpose that
he finished up topping the market by 50
bob. And the cocky went home with one
cow, purchased on terms, and only got
that because Shaggy was caught ahead
of the market.

“R.W.8.”: “Plane Creek” (B.
1/12/’4B) gives the impression that he is
rationalising. I cannot help but feel that
he is closely connected with a banana
patch in hilly country that as yet hasn’t
started to show any signs of erosion.
When that first sign appears—a small
gully—it will come not as a warning that
erosion is about to commence but as a
reminder that erosion is about 70 p.c.
advanced. The last 30 p.c., from first
gully to abandoned land, goes with a
rush and is difficult to stop, and nothing
can ever fully restore those thousands of
tons of beautiful topsoil that quietly
stole off down the streams during that
barely-perceptible first stage of “sheet
erosion.” “P.C.” asks: “How would
any crop be grown if the country were
not first cleared and the rubbish
burned?” and again, “How would we
get improved pastures without first de-
stroying the timber and cultivating the
topsoil?” I’d like to ask a question in
return: How would any soil be lost if
the country were not first cleared and
the rubbish burned? If your land has a
greater fall tjjan 8 p.c., “Plane Creek,
don’t plough it.
* * * *
“Betcha”: Dad Saunders was laying
down the law to the storekeeper. “But
I tell y\ it’s the only fair way o’ dis-
tributin’ goods that’s in short supply,”
he argued. “Otherwise some poor cow
gets none, see? When y’r goods arrive,
whack ’em up equally between all the
blokes that’s got a order.” “All right,
then,” the storeman gave in. “If you
want it that way it suits me.” For the
next few weeks everyone shared alike
with tobacco, sugar, etc., and contented
themselves in the knowledge. Then I
came on a couple of blokes blowing each
other up outside the pub. Evidently the
bone of contention was paint, and diving
hastily inside I asked Dad Saunders for
the low-down. “Aw, they’ve got nothin’
t’ go butcher’s hook about,” he growled.
“How’d they like t’ be held up with their
sheep-dippin’? Cripes, mine’s late already
an’ the sheep growin’ more wool every
day. Y’ see, there’s three or four of us
always use this partic’lar dip, an’ the
flamin’ store’s gone an’ sent us each a
fraction of our order, which is no good
t’ nobody, Yair,” he banged a fist
angrily on the bar. “An’ I tell y’ my
order wus in a flamin’ month before ol’
Charlie Brendon’s, or Ted Watts’s, an’
hang me if either; o’ them cows ’ll listen
t’ reason!”
* * * *
“Chuck”: Andy had no farming ex-
perience, but was full of enthusiasm when
he bought a back block on Dingo Creek
and built himself a hut. “Living next
to big Jack Woolly ’ll make it a good
thing if I can work him right,” Andy
confided. “He’s an old hand and made
piles o’ dough. If I can get him to
advise me I’ll be home on the pig’s back.”
The following year I found him cutting
thistles in Woolly’s paddock. “Yes, I’m
doing fine,” Andy grinned at me, “I’ve
got a decent line of sheep on my block
and a few cows. All it’ll carry yet,
Woolly says. But, mind you, I was
lucky, getting in with that bloke like
I did. We work it that I lend him a
hand on his place and he tells me what
to do on mine. I grubbed that paddock
for him last spring,” he went on, point-
ing to a big clearing up the slope. “And
he what stock I wanted. Now,
if I cut these sixty acres of thistles and
trap this section for him he’s going to
select my rams for me when he goes in
to get his own. Yair, it means a lot,
getting in with Woolly,” Andy winked
slyly. “Knows what he’s doing, that
bloke. One of the real shrewd-heads
at this game.”

“Col’s Cobber”: Col jambed on the
brakes of the ancient car, almost pro-
jecting me through the windscreen, just
as we came opposite one of those red-
triangle road-signs with a row of re-
flectors in an arrow indicating an S-bend
ahead. “Gotta go back and get some
areca nut,” he explained. “Me old dog’s
got tapeworms.” He swung the helm over
and the old girl sat on her hocks as we
came round. “I’d have forgot altogether
only that wormy-lookin’ plate reminded
me,” he concluded.
* * * * .
“Duckholes”: Neville Cayley in his
What Bird Is That? locates the brown
gannet, or booby, north of Capricorn,
but each winter one visits our waters at
the northern end of Moreton Bay. He is
to be seen either alone or with a flock of
gulls. It is rare entertainment to watch
him dive from heights ranging up to
60ft., then, after pursuing his prey under-
water, he appears again and sits on the
water to feed. In a few minutes he is up
in the air again, repeating the perform-
ance. Why he is called a booby is hard
to imagine.
* * * *
“0.8.5.”: I have no wish to start a
controversy on the vexed question as
to whether rabbits kill snakes, but I
simply offer these facts for what they
are worth. Out on Willyacuddlabingi
station, which, as any Canberra expert
can tell you, is not far from the rocket
route, the following is vouched for. The
witchdoctor of the local tribe, who did
a post-graduate course at Haiti and Har-
lem (N.Y.), decided to indoctrinate a few
rabbits in an attempt to overcome the
snake pest, since rabbits are the only
natural enemies the snake has in these
parts. His method is unfortunately a
secret, but it appears that his most pro-
gressive pupil, an old buck with protrud-
ing teeth, discovered that snakes (par-
ticularly when in the grass) are very
sensitive about the gullet. The buck
built a special warren with a cross-
tunnel about 18in. in and at right-angles
to the main entrance. His observed
method was then as follows: One ot nis
pupils was induced to sneer at a snake
and entice it to the warren. Then at a
prearranged signal the bait would dasn
into the tunnel, turn right and stop dead,
leaving only his tail protruding to tne
snake’s-eye view. At the critical moment
the old buck would tell a hair-raising, sto> y
so that the striking snake would harm-
lessly dislodge some hairs from tne y
now distended tail-fur. These hairs wou
enter the .snake’s nostrils as it drew i
its breath for the second strike, and lodge
in the snake’s gullet, thus causing , a
paroxysm of sneezing which led to Joe
death either by apoplexy or
of the fifth cervical vertebra. When la
heard of the witchdoctor was Minister
and Plenipotentiary to the Upper Orinoco
Delta and the rabbit was on the sec
list in the C.S.I.R.
SEA-COAST SUNDOWN.
One long sword-thrust of scintillating light
Lies on the limpid tide’s tranquillity—
Fire, air, and water, component of all three.
Even as the clouds that ■ wing their lazy night
Westward and on, forever losing height,
Where the sun, drowning, lifts defiantly
Still half his golden buckler from the sea,
And, even as I look, is out of sight.
And suddenly all things suffer a sea-change.
Leaving across the levels of the flood,
And on the fallen clouds’ fantastic range
The ever-spreading scarlet of his blood.
Defeated day upon his own bright blade
Has fallen, and himself becomes a shade.
VICTORIA.

Dangers of Inbreeding.
, “O.R.McL.”: It is high time
breeders were warned not to
take the numerous articles advo-
cating “in and inbreeding” too
seriously without getting a true
grasp of the dangers as well as
the good points. “Ngaduri” (B.
17/11/’4B) attempts to cover a
subject in one column which
couldn’t be explained properly
if the total M.O.L. space were
allotted.
Dr. R. B. Kelley, of the Mac-
Master Laboratory, who has
conducted experiments in this
field, does not advocate “in and
inbreeding” himself for the
ordinary breeder, and I would
suggest that “Ngaduri” buy Dr.
Kelley’s book and learn a little
more on the subject before he
encourages others to tread a
very risky path.
Inbreeding can only be done
with very high-class stock, and
even then the number of culls
is often too high to make the
venture sound commercially.
The dangers are loss of vigor
and vitality, deformities, infer-
tility and loss of size, also loss
of intelligence. The last-named
I have witnessed in sheep-dogs,
and a strong outcross didn’t im-
prove them.
The loss of even a small
amount of vigor and vitality in
the Merino sheep, which is often
subject to drought conditions,
cannot be compensated for by a
more even flock. The gains
would have to be tremendous to
compensate any loss of consti-
tution brought about by inbreed-
ing, as a great strain is already
placed upon the sheep by pro-
ducing an unnatural quantity of
wool.
The margin of safety has
been worked out at about 6£
p.c. for ordinary stock. This
varies, of course, depending on
numerous factors, but at or be-
low that is safe. Until the
scientists have discovered con-
siderably more than they know
now and prove beyond doubt
that no harm can come over a
long period of continued inbreed-
ing the ordinary breeder would
be well advised to keep at or
within the 6 } p.c. Credit to in-
breeding has been given in the
past for producing outstanding
individuals in stock, but men-
tion has seldom, if ever, been
made of the culls the inbreeding
produced.
There has been much talk
about progeny-testing (which,
incidentally, has been done in
the blood-horse industry for -
years, the successful studs dis-
carding a sire whose progeny did
not come up to standard, so this
is no wonderful new discovery
as some would have us believe).
A flock could be improved and
kept at a high level much easier
if progeny-testing could be made
practical for the average
breeder. The drawback is a
great deal of extra work, fencing
and expense. Reading the Prin-
ciples and Methods of Animal
Breeding, by R. B. Kelley,
D.V.Sc., would, I feel sure,
make “Ngaduri” a little more
careful about these matters.
Losses from Bruising.
“Agrie”: According to figures
compiled by the National Live-
stock Loss Prevention Board of
America, in 1947 the bruising of
meat-animals in transit caused
a loss of just under 50,000,0001 b.
of meat. Including dead stock
and stock crippled on arrival at
market, the loss was estimated
to be 70,000,0001 b., worth about
$25,000,000.
Unfortunately, comp arable
figures are not available for
Australia, but in 1938 an in-
quiry into bruising losses in
Queensland by A. Little, on be-
half of the Australian Meat
Board, reported in April, 1940,
that the loss from bruising in
Queensland annually was about
£250,000, or about 10s. per head
of the total number of cattle
slaughtered in the State each
year. The Queensland Abattoir
Commission of 1945 reported
that the question of shrinkage
in transit was the main basis for
practically every application for
inland works, but the Commis-
sion considered the loss could
not be as great as most witnesses
averred.
That was a very unsatisfactory
conclusion, particularly in view
of the estimated annual loss
from bruising. Little had re-
ported the result of personal in-
vestigations, often travelling on
stock-trains himself to assess the
damage. The Bureau of Agri-
cultural Economics, Canberra,
would be serving the meat in-
dustry a good turn if it con-
ducted an investigation into these
losses. As the Brisbane abattoir
is a State Government instru-
mentality, the wishes, of the in-
dustry in regard to inland kill-
ing-works are not likely to re-
ceive much consideration. If,
however, authentic figures re-
garding losses from bruising,
etc., of cattle travelling long
distances to coastal meatworks
were available the opposition to
inland works would break down.
Budding Stone Fruits.
“Mr.”: It is best done in
January and February when the
sap in both stock and scion is
running freely—but don’t expect
immediate growth. These dor-
mant buds don’t shoot till the
spring, even when left undis-
turbed on the tree. Start with
the cherries and plums, followed
by apricots, peaches and
almonds. Choose growth-buds;
these are distinguished from the
rounder, fuller blossom-buds by
their flat, pointed appearance.
Blossom-buds are useless for
budding. The best buds are
found on the two middle
quarters of a mature shoot. Dis-
card the small blind buds near
the base and the immature buds
near the tip.
To make an opening for the
bud cut the bark l|in. along the
upper side of the stock and make
another cut at right-angles half
an inch wide across the top of
the first to form a “T.” Open
the bark in two flaps on each
side of the down stroke of the
“T” to bare the wood. Then
slice off the bud with a thin
sliver of wood adhering, but
“ Don't care what you say, Mum—eight hours' sleep's
enough for any cow."
before inserting remove this
wood by gentle pressure on both
sides of the bark above the bud
itself. Slip the bud beneath the
raised flaps of bark with the bud
protruding through the longi-
tudinal cut. Bind firmly with
raffia previously softened by
dampening. In three or four
weeks, when the bud should
have' taken, cut the raffia down
the back of the stock to relieve
pressure on the uniting tissues.
the bud develops it will
force this away.
Oats for Lambs.
“Carlyle”: Their value was
demonstrated by the recent lift
of 128 lambs from the Walpeup
Research Station (Vic.).
Slaughtered at an average age of
16 weeks, their live weight was
84.51 b.; frozen weight 41.21 b.,
and practically all were graded
first quality. A paddock of oats,
sown at 601 b. per acre without
superphosphate and drilled into
the stubble at the end of March,
supplied most of their feed
during winter.
The consignment consisted
mainly of lambs from fat-lamb
mother and fat-lamb sire trials.
As in previous years, lambs
sired by Dorset Horn rams were
heavier and better quality, while
in the mother trials the lambs
from Border Leicester half-bred
ewes gave higher dressed weight.
Chicken-pox.
“Sarina”: It usually appears
amongst poultry during late-
summer months, when rains
have broken a dry spell. The
chicks may be rendered fairly
resistant to the disease if flowers-
of-sulphur—about a teaspoonful
to every 24 birds —is added
regularly to their mash during
the hot weather. Or give tea-
spoonful doses once qr twice
daily, depending on age and size
of chicks, of this remedy:
Liquid extract of sarsaparilla
ilb., potassium iodide ioz., dis-
solved in two quarts of water.
To be used immediately the
disease appears ; paint any warts'
with blue ointment.
Shelter Breaks.
“Camvic”: In all but the
warmer parts of Victoria
cypresses are ideal, being dense
from the ground up, quick
growers, can be lopped and
trimmed without affecting
growth. Lambertiana and Mac-
rocarpa for cooler districts,
Arizona for the warmer. Pines
thrive in cool areas with an
over-25in. rainfall, and, in addi-
tion to shelter, provide a market-
able timber.
Sugar-gum does well in all
but the wetter and colder parts,
and is well suited to the plain
country of western, northern
and north-western Victoria. As
this gum grows very tall, with
few lower branches, the trees
should be planted close together
(about 10ft.), with every second
one lopped to produce heavy
undergrowth ; all er n atively,
under-plant with golden wattle
or the bushy sugar-gum. In cool
southern districts with moist
soils mahogany-gum is preferred
to sugar-gum. For hot, dry
localities the pepper-tree and the
Athel are ideal. They’re quick
growers, drought-resistant and
provide excellent shelter.
Around the homestead lower-
growing hedges and trees will be
preferred. For warmer inland
districts plant Cootamundra-
wattle, pepper-tree, pincushion
hakea, Osage orange, olive, boo-
bialla or tamarisk; for the
cooler lowlands and foothills,
pittosporum, privet, hawthorn,
Irish strawberry, tree-lucerne
and Chinese hawthorn ; for cold
and mountain climates, holly;
and for the coast ti-tree, boobi-
alla and looking-glass plant.
Repairs By Welding.
“Radian”: With machine
spares in short supply, it is well
to remember that parts worn by
earth abrasion are easily recon-
ditioned by welding. For
economy’s sake, repairmen
usually combine oxy-acetylene
and electric-arc welding for this
purpose, although either method
can be used singly.
In modern practice the worn
part is built up by runs of a suit-
able filler-road, ground to re-
quired shape, then hard-faced
with a metal suitable for the
work intended. Weld metals
used depend on the require-
ments of the part under repair—
a rock-drill requires different
treatment from a plough-share—•
one must withstand both abra-
sion and shock, the other meets
abrasion and tensile strain.
Weld metals now obtainable
for this purpose cover practically
every requirement, and range
from a nickel-manganese steel
which is easily filed to a tung-
sten-carbide-cobalt alloy, so
hard that it turns a common
grinding-wheel into a Mallee
dust-storm. Parts reconditioned
by a skilled welder are not only
equal to new but will last several
times longer.
D.D.T. and Fruit.
“8.W.M.”: D.D.T. is not a
cure-all as an insecticide, as
many orchardists would like to
believe. For codlin-moth control
it is almost perfect, as three
sprays of 0.1 p.c. D.D.T. have
cut codlin damage to 0.2 p.c.—
a remarkably low figure. Ex-
periments at Wantirna South
and Ringwood (Vic.) have
proved this.
There is a catch, though.
D.D.T. also kills the ladybirds,
which control red-spider, and the
aphelinus wasps, that prey on
woolly - aphis. Another new
spray—H.E.T.P.—has had to be
added to the D.D.T. spray pro-
gramme to control these two
pests.

insignificant, as it was kept in
check by the normal lead-
arsenate spray against codlins, is
not affected by D.D.T., so it
spreads rapidly. Apple-moth
damage is no less severe than
that of codlins. Up to 57 p.c.
damage from apple-moth has
occurred when three D.D.T.
sprays of 0.05 p.c. strength has
been used cutting codlin
damage to 0.4 p.c. An arsenate
spray (or two) is necessary to
control this pest. Add arsenate
and H.E.T.P. sprays to the
D.D.T. sprayings and your costs
mount. Is it any wonder, there-
fore, that Agriculture Depart-
ments have not recommended
D.D.T. for orchard work as yet?
Stop Saddle Galls.
“E.H.S.”: When the stuffing
of saddle or collar has become
hard or lumpy through repeated
saturation with sweat it can be
restored by pushing a knitting-
needle through the lining and
teasing it apart. Use of a thick
felt pad instead of the ordinary
saddle-cloth absorbs the sweat,
which would otherwise be taken
up by the lining and stuffing. A
few minutes’ rinsing will remove
sweat and other irritating sub-
stances from the pad. Basil
lining is preferable to the or-
dinary woollen fabric, as sweat
and dirt are easily removed by
washing or sponging; an occa-
sional rub with an oiled rag will
keep the leather soft and pliable.
Dog Diet.
“Jock”: After the dog has
been eating meat for a month
or so start him on bones in the
mornings. He needs good, clean
drinking-water during the day
and one meal at night raw,
lean meat chopped into hunks
and not minced (between ilb.
and fib. for an average-sized
Kelpie). To this can be added
raw, green vegetables (cabbage,
silver beet, etc.) cut up and
mixed with the meat. Once he
takes to the vegetable he will
look for it. Expecting your dog
to work on mixed table scraps,
potato, bread or biscuits, milk
or porridge is as bad as asking
yourself to dig a few chains of
post - holes after Christmas
dinner.
Barren Mangoes.
“Dekko”: Near the home of
the pioneer Jardines at Somer-
set, at the top of Cape York
Peninsula, two mango-trees grew
to a large size, but failed to pro-
duce fruit. However, after the
bark of the trees had been
hacked about by a Chinese cook
they produced good crops. At
the time this was done one of
the Jardines was extremely
angry, as he expected the trees
to die and refused to believe the
culprit’s assertion that this rough
treatment would bring about a
cure. Has anyone any experi-
ence of such a remedy or any
proved method of treatment for
inability to set and/or ripen
fruit?
Soil Can Be Saved.
“Plane Creek”: H. A. Lind-
say (B. 1/12/ ’4B) is right about
soil-erosion. Denuded land
can be rendered useful again
for cropping or grazing. It is
not even necessary to follow his
suggestions in districts of high
rainfall. The country only needs
to be allowed to revert to grass
for a few years without grazing,
and the raw subsoil will gradu-
ally be covered with a layer of
mould.
To illustrate how nature re-
pairs injury to the earth, I will
say that I have seen deep-worn
earth-roads in North Queens-
land that finally got so rutty
that they had to be abandoned.
New roads were made parallel
to the old ones, but before they
became plainly defined the old,
worn roads were growing
Townsville lucerne. Silt was de-
posited in the ruts, with the re-
sult that the old roads gradu-
ally filled up again to the level
of the flat land around and be-
came covered with flourishing
grass.
I know grazing paddocks in
my district which contained
nothing but useless weeds and
lantana after years of overstock-
ing. They changed hands,
whereupon the new owners sent
fires through, destroying much
of the rubbish. They brushed
the rest of it and kept stock off
the land for a few years. At
present, some five years after
the changeover was made, the
paddocks are fairly well grassed
and carrying a few stock, and
they’re improving with each
year.
Hints for the Farm.
“W. Court”: If citrus-borers
have attacked small twigs
it is best to cut them off
and burn them before the borers
can shift elsewhere. If limbs
are withering find a borer-hole
and insert a pellet of cottonwool
soaked in carbon bisulphide,
afterwards blocking that and all
other holes with putty or wax.
Watch all citrus for borers
during warm months.
“Bill C.”: It doesn’t pay to
mix poultry. If ducks are
allowed free range over the
same ground as fowls the former
foul the drinking water and
cause illnesses among the hens.
Ducks cannot compete with
fowls at feeding-time, and, as a
result, they seldom fatten or lay
many eggs when running with
hens. Drakes and roosters don’t
agree.
“Johnno”: A simple yet
effective wire-straightener can
be made by bolting several
spools to a strong rail. The
spools must be upright and in a
row. To use this device thread
the wire between the spools;
then grasp one end and pull the
wire through. This device is also
handy when coils are to be
wound, as it will keep the wire
taut without putting undue
strain on it.
“My”: To prevent rabbits and
hares ringbarking fruit-trees
paint the trunks with a mixture
made from loz. of bitter aloes
and lib. of finely-shredded soap
boiled in a gallon of water for
about 20 minutes. When it’s
cool apply to the trunk to a
height of 3ft. from the ground.
“Plane Creek”: Seed-box
soil intended for raising seed-
lings during the N.Q. rainy sea-
son should not contain horse-
manure. We found that its
presence in seed-boxes greatly in-
creased losses of tomato and
other seedlings through “damp-
ing-off.” The seed-boxes were
out of the rain, but the soil be-
came soggy after watering, due
to the absorption of moisture
from the air.
“Big Billy”: Celery, which
does best in a rich soil which
has had liberal diggings of farm-
yard manure, may be set out
during December and January.
In drier districts trench the
plants shallowly, watering be-
fore setting out Bin. to lOin.
apart. Water evenly and keep
it up to the plants to ensure
succulent stalks.
“Sundowner”: In tomato-
growing areas where potato-
blight, stem-borer caterpillar
and looper caterpillar are
troublesome, Bordeaux mixture,
plus 2oz. of lead-arsenate
powder, should be applied about
10 days after planting out and
repeated every two to four weeks
as found desirable.
“Lamo”: Don’t throw away
jam- or fruit-tins; store them
until needed for seeds. Tops and
bottoms should be removed and
the tins filled with good friable
loam, then stood on a bed of
ashes or sand.


Now, just let us take a stroll up-town, I
want you both to have a good time.”
When they went back to the garage
Mr. Racer was carrying two enormous
crayfish—a present from himself to
Mumma.
“We’ll just pick up your parcels and
fix up about the old jeep. Now, Miss
Nelly, say farewell to this handsome car.
Henry! Whatever are you thinking of!
Displaying a roll of money like that!”
LJENRY gave a little crow of delight
1 * and thrust the money into Mr.
Racer’s hand. “See, now, this car, I buy
it, eh? This is the car for me. Mumma
will be pleased I have not bought chsap
things that break."
“Manuka Point will never get over
it,” said Mr. Racer, and gave Nelly’s
arm a comforting squeeze. “You just sit
up in front, little girl, you look tired.
Henry and I won’t be long fixing up the
business part.”
“Please, Mr. Racer, can you lend me
a knife, or scissors, or something—l’m
so tight.” She pushed the new hat off
her head, and with Mr. Racer’s knife
slit the tight band of the new skirt that
refused to unhook. Then she took off
her shoes and gave a little sigh of relief.
They went for a short drive and soon
Mr. Racer was saying goodbye.
“And remember, Henry, it is all square
and above board. Not a penny under the
bonnet, no priority fee, no waiting.”
“Ah,” said Henry, “blackmarket, eh?”
“No, no, of course not. Mind, I’m not
saying she’s a new car, but she’s not that
old, either, and you have a great asset
here, Henry, a great asset.”
Nelly roused herself. “Has it the cer-
tificate of fitness?” He nodded, gave
some papers to Henry and begged them
to look him up next time they had a day
in town.
“Mr. Racer, you have been so good
to us,” Nelly said earnestly as he held
her hand. Mr. Racer almost blushed. He
looked at the boy and girl and then at
the car and thought comfortably that,
after all, it was a shining testimony to
his goodness of heart.
[T was very late—their train had gone
1 two hours ago. Manuka Point was
still many miles away when Nelly gave
a little frightened scream. “Henry!
Henry! Mumma’s money!”
Henry’s jaw sagged. His mouth
opened, but no sound came from it. He
felt as if he had swallowed a pin-
cushion. For perhaps half a minute he
saw on a flickering screen a hopelessly
sordid scene with his mother. Then he
laughed, visualising another picture—
Mumma standing on the verandah, peer-
ing into the dark, throwing her sack
apron over her head and crying “My
darlings! My little ones! Lost in the
city, run over by tram-cars, robbed and
left for dead in some dark street.” He
saw his own pacifying hand and heard
his manly voice speaking words of com-
fort. “And look, Mumma, an asset! ”
Mumma’s relief at seeing them safe
and sound would at least postpone what
he knew would be a long and lively
quarrel. He shook his shoulders and
glanced down at the battered tearful
Nelly. “That’s right!” he howled as he
made the car race forward. “Go on,
howl, nag, nag, nag! Why can’t you
leave Mumma to me? Mumma’s mush-
room hat is safe, isn ? t it? We’ve got the
certificate, haven’t we? And crayfish,
hey? You got new things out of my
sixth, didn’t you? But no, women are
never satisfied, never. Nag, nag, nag!?*
and the trade they had lost through the
war period.
Their mill whistle shrieked in the morn-
ing, and in the evening at knock-off time,
and everyone set his watch by it, and
many were the bullockies who hauled
their great logs,- and when petrol became
more available the log-lorries groaned
beneath the beloved tallowwood of old
Nim, and red and white mahogany for
the post-war building era. The Thorgood
boys delighted in the orders which they
were unable to fulfil. They employed
hands, and began work themselves
before the hands, and knocked off after
the hands. Sach went to Sydney and
bought new and better machines, and
timber was trucked to Sydney and all
over Australia to build new homes.
Sach built a skillion on to his skillion,
and Lash followed suit, and after a time
Noll and Lars both decided to marry, so
that skillions had to be added to their
skillions, and old Nim’s house rambled
even more, and yet Sammy did not return.
They had heard from Sammy, but not
enough, for Sammy was a close one. Old
Mrs. Thorgood was of the opinion “that
the sea had got him,” which did not mean
he was drowned, but that there was a
something in his blood that enabled the
sea to be his mistress. Sach would not
have that, and the other brothers loyally
supported him, but the old woman con-
tinued her muttering.
A FTER a time Sammy returned.
Apprehensive, the brothers expected
him to have changed, but he was the same
Sammy, only, perhaps, a trifle more
thoughtful. He appeared
very much to enjoy the
welcome - home, especi-
ally the dance part of it,
when there was much
merriment and kind
attention by the Gar-
land’s Point girls, who
felt Sammy’s homecom-
ing to be even more
romantic than that of his
brothers. Everyone
wanted to know what
Sammy would do, at
which Sammy looked sur-
prised and said he was
going back to the mill, of
course, although Sach,
looking at him, was not
too happy about Sammy,
and didn’t think he would
stay long.
Sammy, however, did
stay, and if differences
existed between him and his brothers, and
it seemed a pity Sammy didn’t marry
and have children running about
in the various skillions, yet Sammy con-
tinued to stick to his special skillion,
the western one, which had been built
for him when he returned. Sach, who
wished Sammy to be married, gave it out
that a new house would be built for
Sammy when he was married, as the
skillions were becoming too many. Sach
thought, also, that thi& would be an in-
centive for the Garland’s Point girls, al-
though they needed little incentive in that
respect. No, Sammy seemed scarcely to
see the Garland’s Point girls, although he
was pleasant enough, and after a time
the matter of marriage was dropped.
Sammy, however, appeared to grow
more thoughtful as the days passed, and
this disturbed Sach, for he could not con-
template Sammy leaving, or even tolerate
that thought. He even urged Sammy to
take a trip to Sydney thinking Sammy
might find a wife there, and Sammy went
to Sydney, just to please Sach, but when
he returned it was without a wife.
Then Sammy told the brothers he was
going. “Going?” Sach said. He shook
his head in disappointment.
“What you say, Sammy?” said Noll.
“You can’t go, Sammy.”
“I want to go,” Sammy said miserably.
“The sea’s got him,” his mother said,
as though she knew the sea might get all
Norwegians, even small black-eyed Nor-
wegians like Sammy.
“It ain’t the sea,” said Sammy slowly.
The old woman took no notice, but con-
tinued her muttering.
“I’ll build you a new home, there,” said
Sack. “Get a wife and settle down. You
can’t beat a mill.”
“A new home’d be very nice,” said
Sammy. “But I want to go back to the
sea.”
“Said it was the sea,” the old woman
chuckled scornfully, but the boys were
too worried about Sammy to listen to her.
Their efforts to both retain Sammy
and find him a wife redoubled. Noll
made Sammy accompany him with the
orchestra in which he played. The
orchestra, so-called, was really a dance-
band, and played at most local dances.
Sammy went with Noll, and was intro-
duced to quite an assortment of girls, but
none seemed to take his eye. He seemed
more interested in Noll’s playing of the
violin, and indeed while Noll played he
would never shift his attention. Noll’s
playing appeared to fascinate him. It
made him even more thoughtful, and next
day, after* the playing, he would continue
to be thoughtful.
NE night he told the family he was
k-/ going the next day. That shocked
them.
“Going, Sammy?” Sach said. “But
where?”
“Norway,” said Sammy.
“Norway?” they all said, and on this
occasion the entire family was seated
in the central room. Old Mrs. Thorgood
appeared to be very excited. She forgot
to speak Australian. Sammy would not
say why he was going to Norway.
“Norway?” the old woman said ex-
citedly. “What you go there for,
Sammy?”
“Oh, just go,” said Sammy.
Sach wasn’t content with that. “What
for, Sammy?” he asked.
“I’ll get married,” Sammy said, and
his voice was almost surly.
“Married!” The family was excited,
but not happily so.
“Plenty of women here,” Lash said.
“Or in Sydney,” said Sach, looking at
his wife.
“Or here,” said Lars, looking at his.
Mrs. Thorgood mumbled something
which none appeared to hear.
All the brothers sighed. They gave
Sammy up. Noll went to get his violin,
and when he played it was the curious
music of his childhood when old Nim
listened and nodded and nodded and
listened, and for a time it seemed that old
Nim was with them again, nodding and
listening. They remembered the solemn
tales Nim told, and they thought Sammy
must be very different, and probably it
Cut it out — you’ll start a row with Actors’ Equity.”
was quite right his going home to Nor-
way to live.
When Noll finished the playing Sammy
said he thought he would go tomorrow
all right, but the brothers wanted him to
stay another day at least so that they
could fix up a farewell. Sammy agreed,
and the brothers fixed the farewell pro-
perly. There was a dance at the hall,
and the news, flying quickly, brought all
the local folk, especially the girls, who
thought they’d have a last try. Sach
had bought a keg, and to this keg the
brothers went for comfort during the
night, having recourse to it many times,
Sammy included, and after a time Noll
gave it out that he was going to play
his violin out of the orchestra, which he
did, and the girls all vowed Noll had
never played so beautifully, and those
who knew shook their heads mysteri-
ously, and said it was a pity NoE didn’t
do something with that talent, but NoE
was trying to do something with it, so
sadly, so sweetly, so fiercely he played in
a vain endeavor to keep his brother
Sammy in the family, and with it, but
the sweeter, the sadder, the fiercer the
music, the more did Sammy wish to go
to Norway.
Noll came down to the keg, and after
a time wished to play again, but by this
time the dance had finished and aE had
gone with the exception of the Thorgood
boys, Sach, Lash, Lars, Noll and Sammy,
who insisted they would never go home.
They sat in the rich darkness, and NoE
played and the smaU men wept together,
and in that state Sammy said he’d never
leave them if he could help it, and they
took this to be a sort of promise, so that
they wept again, and Noll insisted on
playing more music, but so uninhibited
was he with the releasing action of the
drink that he played weirdly and beauti-
fuHy, and made Sammy want to rise on
certain wings and flee to Norway with-
out having to work his passage in some
bitch of a tramp.
They all went home to their skillions,
and Sammy slept on the floor in the
living-room. He knew they would use his
skilfion when he left it, and was rather
glad. He worked next day untE three in
the afternoon, and then went inside to
wash. His brothers, who thought, per-
haps, that Sammy’s promise of the night
before meant something, said nothing,
but continued working. Lars, after a
time, said he would see Sammy off, and
it was generaUy accepted that Sammy
was going, and that was that. They did
not regret the dance or the keg.
■SB."
CAMMY said good-bye to them all
quietly, and Lars drove him to the
station. He watched the dusty road
ahead, accelerating in places to make the
passage over the corrugations reason-
ably smooth. “You like Norway,
Sammy?” he asked.
“Oh, fair enough,” said Sammy.
“You’ll stay there?” asked Lars.
“M’m,” said Sammy doubtfully.
“Girl, eh?” said Lars.
“Lovely,” said Sammy suddenly. “Saw
her in Oslo.” His words seemed to pour
as he described her. “I’ll find her,” he
said enthusiastically.
“Engaged?” said Lars.
Sammy chuckled. “Cut it out, Lars,”
he said.
They had reached the station. The
train wasn’t immediately due. Sammy
bought his ticket, a single to Sydney.
“I’ll get a ship in Sydney. Work my
way.”
“But this girl,” said Lars. “What’s
her name?”
“Don’t know,” said Sammy. “She was
in Oslo. I’ll find her again.”
“But she might be married,” said Lars.
“You never know.”
“She ain’t married,” said Sammy con-
fidently. “I’ll find her somehow.”
Lars shook his head doubtfully, and
said “Fancy that.” He was still mum-
bling about it when the Sydney Express
came churning in. He helped Sammy to
a window-seat, and Sammy leaned out,
talking until the train went.
A S the train gathered up its loins, its
r x clinking, clankering loins, Lars
shouted “Well, come back,” thinking
that Sammy never would, and Sammy,
leaning out further, shputed, “I
might,” but Lars did not appear
to have heard, for he was "stand-
ing, shaking his head, and looking
down at the platform. Sammy, in the
train, felt suddenly released from the
strange family which was his, and Noll’s
accursed violin, and so free did he feel
that he thought he might come back,
and he turned to Lars-to say so a second
time, but Lars was lost to him, and the
shout that came back to Lars was muffled
in sound and black smoke that rushed
away from the engine, so Sammy just
waved and waved until Lars and the
station were well out of sight.

1. —Visitors are due on the
3.30 bus. At 3.24 you finish
sweeping the grass-clippings
from the front path and dive
into the bathroom. By 3.26 you
have shaved, and you are just
drying yourself from the shower
as the front bell rings. Hearing
the ladies chattering in the
lounge-room, you decide on a
quick sortie, with only a towel
around you, through the hall
and into the bedroom, where you
left all your fresh clothes. As
you are pulling your singlet on
over your head the towel comes
adrift from its moorings and at
that instant your wife ushers
two of the ladies in to take
their hats off. This wifi, be indi-
cated to you by shrill screams.
Do you consider that, in the de-
bate on the subject which is due
to begin several hours later,
your mild contention that your
wife should have knocked be-
fore entering will weigh heavily
with her, taking into considera-
tion that she will remind you
that at regular intervals from
2.45 on she had tried to get you
in from the garden?
2. —You go out the back door
one morning to get the milk-pot
and the cat darts in. While you
are making the morning-tea he
keeps rubbing himself obsequi-
ously around your legs, and as
you are walking across the
kitchen with the teapot he nearly
trips you. A cupboard becomes
an obstacle to his volition from
your dropkick, and the combined
screech and thud brings from the
bedroom a caustic “Are you
kicking that cat again?” Think-
ing fast, you open the frig, door
and immediately slam it shut.
State whether, in the ensuing dis-
cussion on the subject, you would
pin much hope to the wife’s
forgetting that the screech from
the fummy came before the frig,
door slammed after you had
contended that the screech was
caused by the cat’s injudiciously
waving its tail in front of the
closing door.
3. —Your wife has noticed in
the evening paper a ragshop
special-bargain ad. for the fol-
lowing day. Other arrangements
preclude her going to town, so
she deputes you to get it. She
particularly stresses that it must
be 4} yards of the material so
as to be sufficient for the “new
length,” and that it must be the
pinky-beige slub-repp and noth-
ing else. She further advises
that you write it down so that
there will be no mistake. This
you naturally reject as a reflec-
tion on your excellent memory,
telling her firmly that only a
halfwit could possibly make a
mistake with a material name
like that. When she unwraps
the parcel that evening and
comments tearfully on the
quarter-wittedness of a man
who can’t tell the difference be-
tween dusty-pink seersucker and
pinky-beige slub-repp, and that
the 3i yards you’ve bought
would allow only for a skirt
that would be halfway between
her knees and thighs, briefly out-
line the arguments you would
adduce to convince her that for
a woman with such shapely legs
as hers the ultra-short skirt is
ideal, that the new-length skirts
will be out of date possibly in
a few weeks, that seersucker is
less likely to go out of fashion
quickly than slub-repp, and that,
anyway, she still has pink in it.

work late one afternoon and find
to your consternation the piano-
tuner packing his kit of tools.
The seemingly extra-sweet smile
your wife confers on you con-
firms in your mind your worst
fears, and the piano-tuner’s in-
decent haste to depart after your
arrival lends added confirma-
tion that the idiot had found the
bottle of whisky you’d planted
in the rarely-used instrument’s
works and had handed it over
to your wife, who emphatically
“won’t have whisky in the
house.” As the door closes on
him you anticipate the gather-
ing storm by getting in first
with “My dear, let me explain
about the bottle” —— She raises
her eyebrows at this point and
observes “What on earth are
you talking about?” Forgetting
(temporarily) the monster who
swiped your Scotch, would you
consider it best then and there to
make a clean breast of it, or
would you say quickly: Why,
that bottle of your favorite per-
fume I had sent from Anthony s
—hasn’t it been delivered yet?”
and next day rush an order
through for one?

found by his mother in the
garage pea-green and groaning,
and she gets from him a con-
fession that he has been trying
out one of your cigars. This
enormity, you are informed on
arriving home from the office, is
the result of your abject failure
to exercise your disciplinary
functions as a parent, that if this
is not checked he will turn out
to be a criminal, and that you’ll
have to do something to bring
the young rascal to heel. Under
the circumstances would you
deem it prudent to retire up the
yard with Johnny to the vege-
table patch, so that as you are
disciplining him the roars of
laughter when you describe how
you felt the first time you tried
one of your old man’s cigars
will be less likely to be heard
from the kitchen?

Air-mail in the Gulf
Although Jack Harris’s exploits as the
mailman of the Gulf country (B.
22/12/’4B) make a good Australian
story, it certainly reflects on the effi-
ciency of the P.M.G. Department. The
pedal-wireless may have broken the
silence of the inland, but the mail-service
has not improved in the last half-century.
The P.M.G. could take lessons from
the R.A.A.F., which, when it had many
units in the Gulf country, provided one
of Australia’s best outback mail-services
with an amphibious Walrus biplane
capable of landing on the rivers, the sea
or land with a minimum waste of time.
When stationed at Karumba, at the
mouth of the Norman, in 1943 we had a
mail-service as good as any other in Aus-
tralia. No sooner had the mail arrived at
Normanton than the “old Duck” was
waiting. It then began a systematic
Cook’s tour, landing at numerous A. 0.85.
(advanced operational bases), radar
stations, fuel depots, squadrons and repair
units. Although some of the units were
only six-men strong, they were never
neglected. Even if there were no inward
mail, the aircraft would land or alight to
pick up outward mail the boys had wait-
ing.
What’s wrong with a helicopter service?
The cost would be high, but surely men
who give a lifetime to developing Aus-
tralia’s neglected far north are worthy of
a mail-service at ordinary rates.
Instead of spending his between-session
breaks receiving deputations and issuing
press statements, the P.M.G. ought to visit
the Gulf country, preferably in the “wet,”
and see how he could improve the mail-
service.—Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.).
Ratdio Aids to Flying
One of the- best ways of keep-
ing track of aircraft would be to
fit them with those sets known familiarly
by their code name of “Fanny,” or, more
officially, “ABKS.” These automatically
transmit whenever they come under
search by ground radar, and they
transmit a signal capable of six different
codings as well as a distress signal, all
under control of the pilot, s
They have been tested up to 200 miles’
range, the aircraft not flying below
10,000 ft. With a ground radar at mid-
points between capital cities as well, the
aircraft would be under continuous check
all the way ; codings would be so allo-
cated for each flight as to provide posi-
tive identification. Even if the aircraft
be beyond the normal reflection range
of the radar the reinforced reflection
from the “Fanny” will always give
coverage. The “Fanny” weighs only
351 b. and is available from Disposals at
about £5. — Woag (Q.).
Civil Servants
C. L. A„ Abbott’s article (B. 15/12/’4B)
about Australians being “just pushed
around” says “they have seen hordes
of Federal Government servants created,
100,000 more than in 1939, each blown
up with self-importance, and many of
them rude, overbearing and inefficient.”
Let us analyse this. It purports to be
a plain statement of fact about “each”
Federal servant. I have the honqr
to be one of that tribe —have been for
40 years—but Mr. Abbott does not know
me and I have yet to know the pleasure
of meeting him, nor, so far as I kn«»w,
have we any friends, acquaintances or
enemies in common. So Mr. Abbott
cannot possibly know whether I am blown
up with self-importance or deflated with
an inferiority complex.
“Many are rude and inefficient.” Does
he mean 10 or 100 or 10,000? From a
man like Mr. Abbott, who knows “each”
Federal servant (except me), Bulletin
readers are entitled to hear the awful
truth. Or is he just being rude? —
R. A. B. (Vic.).
Those Six Million Jews
If Dr. Leo S. Bueck, formerly Chief
Rabbi of Berlin (B. 8/12/’4B), is right in
his estimate of 5,500,000 Jews in Russia,
then the Jejvish charge that the Germans
murdered 6,000,000 Jews during the
recent war is wrong. Whitaker’s
Almanac for 1947 prints a table com-
piled on world Jewish authority in which
the numbers of Jews in the world in 1939
and 1945 are given as 16,838,000 and
11,000,000 respectively.
The difference represents the number
alleged to have been destroyed by Hitler’s
orders. In Jewish propaganda it was
stated in round figures, and for good
measure, as 6,000,000. But, according
to Dr. Bueck, there are 11,000,000 Jews
still alive in the United States and Russia
alone, so that the millions of Jews dis-
tributed through the rest of the world
must be deducted from the murdered
6,000,000. There had long been reason
to suspect the accuracy and good faith
of that figure.
It was known, for instance, that the
number of Jews still in Rumania was
much greater than the figure given in
Whitaker, that the figure for South
Africa was understated; and now it
appears that the number of Jews in Russia
was underestimated by more than two
millions. For obvious reasons this im-
mense discrepancy in the alleged facts
of a charge of genocide demands investi-
gation on what Dr. Evatt would call
“the highest level.”—J. W. R. (Tas.).
Equal Pay
There’s an angle to the work of women
in commerce and industry which still
fogs me.
Argue as men will, I can’t for the life
of me see justice in withholding equal pay
for equal work. The “logic” of assessing
wages on the basis of sex instead of on
the type and amount of .work done con-
tinues to escape me.
The common argument against is that
women don’t have as many dependants
as men. Actually, a great number of
them do, though they don’t broadcast the
news. Do women get flats or rooms,
meals, tram rides, clothing, seats at the
pictures, vegetables or fruit cheaper be-
cause they are women? Do women
shareholders receive lower dividends than
men? Of course not. When the cost of
living, then, is equally as high for a
“It's just the thing for these suede shoes.”
woman as a man, for what justifiable
reason is she not paid the same if she
does the same kind and quantity of work?
—Una Auld (N.S.W.).
Amateur Radio
“Nejos” (B. 22/12/’4B) is rather off the
rails in insisting that advisory com-
mittees include members who are “ex-
perienced technical men, despite com-
parative youth.” All amateurs are sup-
posed to be experienced enough techni-
cally in order to function as licensees in
the first place. P.M.G. officers cannot be
accused of laxity in marking examination
papers. I know one man, a first-rate
radio technician and journalist of many
years’ experien.ee, who failed no fewer
than five times because of poor showing
at Morse code. In an advisory-committee
appointment there should be emphasis on
the operating ability of the appointee.
How can one who virtually sits in judg-
ment on his fellow-amateurs be competent
to direct attention to breaches of tele-
graphic operation if he is not a highly
proficient Morse operator?
Despite those who think only in terms
of amateur communication by the spoken
word, the Morse key will be a useful
accessory for decades to come, and it is
easy to commit breaches of regulations
by misuse of it. If the observer is limited
to telephonic operation he is not in the
picture regarding what may pass in a
welter of dits and dahs.
Progress and the increased use of radio-
telephony by amateur stations make ad-
visory committees necessary. The human
voice in its many amateur forms reaches
millions of listeners, and they aren’t all
understanding or even tolerant when con-
fronted with verbal exhibitionism and
performances of bad taste. “Nejos” tries
to pin most of the blame for overmodu-
lation on the part of telephony “DX-
hounds” on to the old hand by asserting
that the veteran takes advantage of tech-
meal “know-how” to push overseas a
stronger signal than the newer man. That
won’t bear examination. There may be
one or two oldsters radiating “poor”
signals of some form or other, but there
are plenty of lads who need guidance both
in the nature of transmission and what
they chatter about.
It is certain that a more fraternal spirit
existed between radio amateurs when the
use of radio-telephony was confined to
a few. Dislike of verbal mannerism can
be responsible for unwarranted friction
between individuals, who, when they may
meet face to face, find that each isn’t such
a bad fellow after all. Which indicates
that everything is in favor of radio-vision
communication between private indi-
viduals in the distant future. — Hadit
(N.S.W.).
Wool Away!
From Isis Downs to Melville Forest
every man who ever clanged the tongs or
juggled a hand-piece, every piece-picker,
tar-boy and wool-presser, every babbler
and every expert, not to mention the
ancient balladists who still think a singing
line worth a dipful of modern verse,
ought to be interested in a wild and
woolly event that occurred at the Inter-
national Livestock show at Chicago early
this month. There, believe it or not, was
decided the “world’s champion amateur
and professional” shearing championship
for 1948.
Chicago “Daily Tribune” put its Lee
Shashere on to write it up. Mr. Shashere,
with that flair which distinguishes the
American, or perhaps the Illinois, re-
porter, promptly discovered a unique con-
tender in the Rev. Hugh E. Dooley, who
back home in Crawfordsville preaches to
one flock on Sunday and shears another on
Monday.... He is pastor at two churches on
Sunday, and all during the week he does
professional sheep-shearing on his neighbors’
farms.
What the A.W.U. intends to do about
this isn’t clear, nor is it stated whether or
not the reverend greasy knocks down his
cheque with the rest of the team at the
cut-out. Anyhow, he was favorite to
beat “Roland Burkhart, 36, left-handed
shearer from Pandora (O.), who snipped
his way to the 1947 championship.”
Roland, possibly the strangest thing that
ever emerged from Pandora’s box,
stoushed the clerical shingler by shearing
three sheep at an average time of 2min.
25sec. per sheep. This, according to the
“Daily Tribune,” made him world’s
champ for 1948. Meantime, in the 4-H
section (equivalent of our Junior Farmers)
a 20-year-old Kansan, Maurice McClure,
won with an average of 6min. 44sec.
It wasn’t stated whether the sheep were
pet longwools or pocket - bottomed
Merinos, but since any good Australian
shearer is capable of knocking off a sheep
in 2min. 30sec. and the guns can give that
10 on and a licking, and since most junior
farmers in the sheep-country would
wonder how anybody who took 6min. to
shear a sheep put in the time, it seems
that a great chance exists for some enter-
prising entrepreneur to gather a team of
fast men, export them to the U.S.A., lie
them low until the time comes, and then
rake off the takings at anything from 10
to 25 to one. Properly handled, it could
partly solve Mr. Chifley’s dollar problem.
It must be very boring for the sheep
when shearing comes around in America.
—Swanbill (W.A.).
Social Services
If you go into a public ward of a
hospital the Government pays. What-
ever X-ray treatment you receive while
an in-patient is also “on the Govern-
ment.” But suppose your doctor says:
“Look, old man, I’d like an X-ray of
that thing. Drop round to the hospital
in the morning and we’ll fix it up.” It
will cost you a guinea or whatever the
hospital’s X-ray fee happens to be. If
you are alert you will reply to the
doctor: “Kindly arrange for me to be
admitted to the hospital tonight so that
I can have my X-ray tomorrow as an
in-patient.” It will then cost you no-
thing.
Also, concerning Social Services
generally, these words emanate from the
highest level: There is no direct con-
nection between social-service payments
made by contributors to the National
Welfare Fund and the benefits they are
entitled to receive by way of social ser-
vices. How true, how very true!
T.H. (N.S.W.).
Naming the New State
The New-State Movement in north-
eastern N.S.W. will take its next step in
February, when a conference will define
boundaries, select a name and draft a
constitution.
While selection of a name may not in
itself carry the revived movement very
far, it should give a rallying-point for
more constructive work. AU down the
years the name New England has been
given to the approximate area of this new
State, though the title belongs more to
the Northern Tablelands than to the
Northern Rivers, which area is the truer
home of the movement.
New England, nevertheless, is a good
name, with historical significance to the
movement and Australian development;
it is to be hoped that it will not lightly
be dropped merely for the sake of some-
thing different.
Queensland has seen something of un-
imaginative naming in an effort to find
a suitable name for the proposed civic
amalgamation of its beautiful South
Coast beach-townships like Coolangatta
and Surfers’ Paradise. So far the
Queensland imagination has not gone far
beyond “Pacific Riviera” or “Pacific
Paradise” synthetic Hollywoodisms
which would impose a staggering initial
handicap on any community.
State-names in Australia would win
no prizes for. originality and few for
beauty ; so, if there is to be a new State
it should be named New England, which
is euphonious, rolls easily off the tongue
and is a link with the land whence we
sprang. New England survived in the
United States not as the name of a State,
but as a memory of an old way of life
out of which much of the best of modem
America has stemmed; it has poetry,
meaning and dignity and could well stand
inclusion in the Australian list of States.
Either that, or a really well-chosen abo-
riginal name should collect the £5O which
is being offered as a prize for the name
finally chosen. — Dee (Q.).
Native Labor
Professional native-labor recruiters in
New Guinea are making big money.
Commercial firms are eager to pay re-
cruiters £l6 for each native who can be
persuaded to contract for one year, and
the demand is still rising. However, many
natives sent to commercial firms are well
below standard; many have been de-
formed and diseased, and have had to be
returned to their villages, a costly and un-
necessary business. The official view is
that a deformity or inherent weakness, or
even positive t.b., in a native who is wil-
ling to work should not be the cause of
his rejection, but the poor types being
passed on from distant centres with Gov-
ernment approval are a reflection on both
the recruiters and responsible administra-
tion officers concerned. Lim-Limbu
(N.G.).
Chemists’ Hours
Like “P.D.” (B. 8/12/’4B) I am a
country chemist, but I find it impossible
to reconcile his statements with facts.
Chemists enjoy certain privileges which
are denied to other traders. One is that
of staying open after competitors have
closed their doors. Too many have
abused this, and it is time the authorities
clamped down on it and only permitted
certain items to be sold during this time.
In our town there are seven pharmacies,
and we close at 6 p.m.—there is a move
to have this altered to 5.30 p.m. Each
one has a good business without recourse
to selling what “P.D.” calls “various
fancy goods, such as china.” My advice
to him is to cease selling these items, and
then he will not have to juggle with “con-
founded partitions.” Stick to your job
selling and dispensing medicines.
Early-closing is here to stay and pre-
vents the unscrupulous trader from stay-
ing open after his competitors have closed
their doors. If there was no Early Clos-
ing Act then we would have little leisure
to enjoy the money we make. As regards
newsagents carrying chemists’ “lines,” this
is ridiculous. The only exclusive “lines”
belonging to chemists are those sold under
a special contract there are no
other goods exclusive to chemists.
This is a free country, and manufacturers
desire the greatest distribution of their
goods, whether they be sold by chemist,
newsagent, grocer or ham-and-beef shop.
—R. W. (N.S.W.).


Marketing Our Goods
A correspondent from Singapore men-
tioned the poor quality of Australian
goods in and about that city. It seldom
was any different in the Far East, where
I have been prowling around for the past
40 years.
Leaving out the quality of the goods—
quite a lot could be written about this —-
the packing is awful and the labels do a
lot of harm. I understand there are
Trade Commissioners in China and
Hong Kong; shouldn’t they see to these
matters?
Just after the recent war there was a
rush of Australian products to this part
of the world. The products sold, mainly
because of a shortage here. People are
already more “choosy,” and Australia
suffers in consequence. It is remarkable
just how people in this part of the world
are attracted by an appealing packing and
label. You can’t make sales any more
of leaky and partly-rusted tins. That old
mentality of “It’s good enough for the
Far East” has done Australia a lot of
harm. I live here, with my eyes and ears
open, and we want manufacturers’ per-
sonal representatives— not Trade Commis-
sioners—to have a look round, as do
those from the United States and Britain.
When the “Golden Age” and horseracing
debauch is over Australia will be looking
for more overseas markets. Only the best-
quality will sell, and now is the time to
shake things up a bit, otherwise Australia
will be on the thin end before long.—
Mariner (S. China).
Our Private Lives
There is a close parallel to “R.W.’s”
account of “National Health” in what
happened in wartime (B. 8/12/’4B).
Hundreds of thousands of men and
women entered the services, submitting to
a strict discipline, forfeiting most of their
civil rights from the right to present a
joint petition to the right to spend their
spare time as they thought fit. Many
were union members, yet, when they were
required to work 20 hours a day with-
out overtime, the unions did not protest.
Every detail of a man’s life was written
down, from his wife and children and
the number of “crimes” he had commit-
ted to the number of filled teeth in his
head, and all this was open to anyone
who handled the records.
The soldier submitted willingly to this
system mainly because patriotism is a
pretty strong force in the average man’s
life, and he felt that only by so doing
could he be true to his country. But
try the same system on him today and
see what happens.—X. Q. X. (Q.),
Youthful Crime
All sorts of things are blamed for it —
the war, talkies, lack of home training,
etc. —but the fact remains that jail holds
no terror for the modem youth, simply
because he believes that conditions “in-
side” are such that life there is not at all
unpleasant. In recent years we have had
broadcasts of concerts from inside
prisons, stories of lifers having songs
published, radio-sets, books and various
other comforts made available to
prisoners, and so forth. The youthful
offender will be shown considerable sym-
pathy on account of his youth, and there
is a good chance of his serving his sen-
tence on a prison farm, where conditions
are even better than in many homes. So
improved is the environment of punish-
ment that a jail term is regarded as some-
thing of a holiday.
The best way to check serious youthful
crimes would be to reintroduce the death
penalty for murder and rape and the lash
for other crimes of violence. Prison-
reform people will be horrified, but how
do they feel about the victims of these
louts and those who mourn them?
Society must protect itself, and namby-
pambyism is about as useful in this re-
gard as it would be against an escaped
tiger.—W. P. T. (N.S.W.).
“The Garden City”
“Chevroford’s” comments on “arboreal
murder” in Melbourne (B. 1/12/ ’4B)
apply equally to Adelaide, self-styled “the
garden city.” Outside the city’s belt of
parklands very little remains to support
the appellation; on the contrary,
Adelaide’s suburbs are a rather dreary
procession of cottages, flats and villas
piled endlessly on one another and en-
closing meagre allowances of space, three-
quarters of which is taken up by the
local sporting clubs. Small room is left
for trees and gardens.
War-time inmates of Adelaide’s mili-
tary (now repat.) hospital at Daws-road
will learn with regret that the magnificent
avenue of gums is gone—with the blessing
of the local council —although expert
opinion was that the trees were not a
danger to newly-erected homes near by.
Latest victims of the axe, several
splendid gums taking up no more than
100 yards of the plantation centring the
Port-road are to be replaced by tennis-
courts for the employees of a neighbor-
ing factory, despite the fact that both
north and south of the small tree-area is
ample room for a dozen clubs. Unend-
ing streams of platitudes have been
lavished on Light, the city’s original sur-
veyor, for his foresight in surrounding
the city with a park. No praisemonger,
however, has followed the Colonel’s pre-
cedent by establishing an outer series of
parklands, present practice tending to the
elimination of such as already exist.
—Karrimba (S.A.).
India Shows “Chif” a Point
The Indian Government is giving relief
from income tax to new industries, which
could, with advantage, be done by
the Chifley Government. The Australian
High Commissioner in India (H. R. Gol-
lan) told Brisbane Chamber of Com-
merce that the industrialisation of India,
on which it had been proposed to spend
millions, had been shelved in favor of
quick development and an early return
for the money spent. At the moment a
serious problem there is the danger of in-
flation. Consumer goods are not available
in large quantities, and the hitherto low
wages have been increased considerably.
The Government there, Gollan said, was
trying to take the surplus money from the
people in savings schemes, and in order
to improve the marketing position many
goods had been removed from the list of
prohibited exports.
New industries were contemplated,
he added, and any industry started
within the next three years would be ex-
empt from income tax for five years.
. When primary producers’ or manufac-
turers’ organisations complain of the
retrogressive effect of high taxation on
production Mr. Chifley naively mentions
the few million pounds granted in
taxation reductions the previous year,
but, as most of this represents taxa-
tion reductions in the lower-income
groups, it has no real effect on produc-
tion.
If Mr. Chifley would go out “incog.”
and speak to the public he would soon
"Would you mind moving away? She's allergic to fish."
realise that the saying “I am not going to
work for Chif any longer or any more
than is absolutely necessary” is not a
figment of the imagination of those sec-
tions of the community always hostile to
a Labor Government. How can any
Government say it does not retard pro-
duction, for instance, when a grazier who
has to sell his sheep in a drought is taxed
as if the receipt from such a sale
is ordinary income instead of being a
realisation of his capital assets? And
how is a grazier going to restock when
the drought eventually breaks if the
Chifley grab has taken most of his capital
through treating as income the receipts
from forced sales of stock? — Chappie
(Q-).
Erosion
H. A. Lindsay’s statement (B. 1 /12/’4B)
that a raw subsoil can be restored to full
health in as little as ten years by methods
developed by C.S.I.R. and the Waite In-
stitute is interesting if surprising. I
gathered from such agricultural authori-
ties as Lord Northbourne, Sir Albert
Howard and Ehrenfried Pfeiffer that,
where the topsoil has been entirely lost,
land becomes desert. I’ve read that one-
quarter of the badly-eroded land in the
U.S.A. will probably never be of any use
for farming again, while a larger area will
need long and expensive treatment to
restore it.
There have been many warnings that
large areas of the world’s agricultural
lands are in danger of being permanently
ruined by reckless methods of farming.
Lord Northbourne, in Look to the Land,
remarked that probably more soil has
been lost since 1914 than in all previous
history.
With such world-wide interest in the
problem it is strange that such a success-
ful process as that described by “H.A.L.”
has not become widely known outside
Australia.
Incidentally, neither Howard nor
Pfeiffer has any time for super., which
“H.A.L.” declares essential to the process
he describes. Howard —he is by no means
alone —says of this and similar artificial
manures: “The slow poisoning of the
soil by artificial manures is one of the
greatest calamities that have befallen man-
kind.” — Castlereagh (N.S.W.).
Fellowship of Writers
While never an active member of the
Fellowship of Australian Writers, as
“Another Freelance” (B. 8/12/’4B), I am
one of those who received encourage-
ment and aid in an hour of need from it
during its earlier days when it numbered
so many well-known literary people
amongst its members. Recently, for the
first time, I attended a function held by
it. Nobody knew me, and I knew nobody
except, of course, Lawson and Brennan,
whose portraits grace the walls of the
society’s room. The executive who
spoke had a foreign accent and said
nothing to induce me to become a mem-
ber of the organisation. Suggestion to
do this came later from an entirely dif-
ferent and unexpected party during a
chance visit I was paying in company
with a “comrade” friend to Marx House.
I was assured that the Fellowship is now
a very live organisation and that every
writer should join it. I have repeatedly
been reminded —even by some members
of the clergy—that unless I lean “Left”
I cannot hope for a hearing as a writer
anywhere today. Which may or may not
be true.
My friend at Marx House was not so
sure about the value of my pen when I
criticised, purely from a literary angle (I
naturally recognised no other), a fairly
recent Soviet prize-winning novel I classed
as very second-rate fiction. This is the
sort of thing that gives a writer to think.
No doubt a strong Writers’ and Artists’
Union, whose members’ votes became
important politically, would alter the
apathetic side-stepping to literature and
art indulged in by the present Govern-
ment. But is that to be desired? While
unionism is good for the group it can
hamper the individual—especially the
writing individual. In any case, with re-
gard to the present controversy on
literary taxation, the Government ought
to pay the individual voter the courtesy
of coming out into the open and at least
naming the other bodies that might claim
freedom from taxation along with the
winners of competitive literary events, if
such were granted to these. The writer
might then know what his standing was,
if any, in the community as recognised
by the Government. One voter might
not make any difference to a Govern-
ment, although the individual’s import-
ance is recognised by the compulsory
vote. And the Government should be
reminded that there is still nothing in
the Constitution to prevent one voter
from becoming an active protagonist.
Before we talk about forming a new
organisation of writers, let us know if
we mean anything at all as a body to
our country.— Competitor (N.S.W.).
Inconsistent Critics
From a certain section of the working-
class comes a steady flow of criticism
of the “big companies” and “capitalistic
concerns.” Yet these same critics in-
variably go to large firms when they want
to purchase expensive goods—radios,
furniture, watches and the like. They
would never dream of buying such articles
at small stores, fdr it is their belief that
not only would they be more costly there
but they might also be of inferior quality.
Which only goes to show that, although
much mud is thrown at progressive firms,
the workers really respect them. —W. C.
(Q-).
Housing
Amending tenancy laws (B. 1/12/’4B)
might persuade a few people with large
home? to sub-let, but that’s no real solu-
tion of the housing problem. Most people
want their home to themselves, and that
applies as much to young couples as it
does to the oldsters.
If war broke out tomorrow there
would be plenty of labor for building
Army and Navy establishments and
plenty of materials for essential indus-
tries in a national emergency. Surely
the housing situation is a national
emergency.
In our shops there are thousands of
articles and tons of rubbish manufactured
in Australia which nobody really needs.
Able-bodied men making those trivial
nothings could be diverted to a compre-
hensive housing plan. If we don’t popu-
late Australia someone else will, and
the blame \yill not lie with young ex-
servicemen who refuse to rear families in
a room or two in someone else’s house.
—lslander (N.S.W.).
Dutch and the Indies
Australia is most interested in the out-
come of the struggle at her northern gate-
way, but nobody would think so to read
the inane statements of her Prime
Minister. Instead of pledging Australia’s
support to constitutional government in
the Indies, which is the status quo of
Dutch supremacy until the new United
States of Indonesia can be set up as advo-
cated by Holland, he expresses “regret”
that the Dutch have once more had the
temerity to do what he himself is afraid
to do here, govern.
Still, one could not expect much sup-
port for constitutional authority from one
whose own actions and that of his Gov-
ernment have been to defeat the con-
stitution of this country in every possible
way, regardless of the will of the people,
to whom he refused the right of a refer-
endum on banking.
Posterity may yet have cause to curse
the present rulers of this land of neglected
opportunities, when the Asiatic hordes of
Communism sweep down through our
northern gateway ; there will be no Dutch
there to take the first blows, for we shall
have jeered them out of the Indies so that
puppets set up by the Japs during the
war, and who now owe their allegiance to
Moscow, might be “free.” “Oh, freedom,
what crimes are committed in thy name! ”
—Repatriate (Q.).
Root of the Matter
In Queensland A.B.C. is talking of
ending the broadcasting of inter-State
racing on Saturday afternoons. Though
they wouldn’t admit it, no better luck
could come the way of the thousands of
optimists who crowd the “betting shops”
on race days. Cessation of race broad-
casts would hit the s.p. bookie hard, for
it would discourage the dumb bettors who
bet on every race as it comes, always
hoping for their luck to change. It is
from these excitable fools that s.p. para-
sites draw the bulk of their riches; they
do not like the quiet chaps who have
a few bob on a good nag when and if
he starts, and ignore the others. — Anti-
broadcast (Q.).
“Labor’s” much-vaunted fight for the
poor man has not done him much
good. Grants of higher wages and
shorter working hours look all right on
paper, but the fact is that few workers are
living as well as they did before “Labor”
got busy with its plans. The older men
admit this quite frankly, saying that in
bygone years they got less money, but
that it went much further. At present
only wealthy people are able to live up
to pre-war standards, and conditions are
still worsening.—W. C. (Q-).
This example of red-tape takes beating:
On the transfer of a senior postal clerk
from one town to another the postal de-
partment refused to pay 30s. a week
rental to hold a house for three weeks
until his successor arrived. However,
after the successor had taken up duty and
missed the opportunity of obtaining a
house, the department paid him a 305.-a-
-week accommodation allowance. This
arrangement lasted for two years, in-
volving an unnecessary expenditure of
£ls6.— Plain Australian (Vic.).
Tell “Melbn” (B. 22/12/’4B) that, after
discussion, the authorities have taken the
reasonable view, and Maughan’s Wild
Life Sanctuary at Balwyn will continue,
permits having been extended to cover all
but a few of the Australian animals and
birds there, which are the delight of Mel-
bourne kiddies.— Janus (Vic.).
I read with disgust of the political un-
rest in Victoria, and suggest to the Liberal
and Country parties that instead of be-
having like schoolgirls they, in this hour
of our trial, black-out their puerile dif-
ferences and amalgamate to form an
Australian Democratic party with the
specific aim of preserving, if not for us,
then for our children, the British way
of life.—H. H. M. (W.A.). '
Federal politicians’ pensions of £8 a
week make it rather pointless that
invalid and old-age pensioners have
to go through the means tests to get a
pension well below the basic wage.
It seems that our “Labor” members
look fifter themselves, but the people can
go hang.— Killoran (N.S.W.).
