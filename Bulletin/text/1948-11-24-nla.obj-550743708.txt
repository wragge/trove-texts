I knew A.G.S. pretty well in Welling-
ton when he was on the “Evening Post”
and I was on the “Dominion,” in 1907 and
perhaps 1908. His coming to the “Post”
was an immense condescension in the
eyes of juniors like myself. It was as if
the editor of the “Spectator” had re-
signed to become assistant-editor of the
N.Z. “Freelance.”
There was only one literary journal in
Australasia then, and Stephens was it —to
young writers. He knew it. I remember
—at second- or third-hand —complaints
of colleagues on The Bulletin that he
thought he was God.
On the “Post” he was just an ordinary
leader-writer and writer of special
articles, with an extraordinary mana,
which probably dimmed a bit when he
was put to writing series of articles on
the Arbitration Act, for example, and
did them not very differently from
another man.
But he was a bracing personality, much
interested in the young—l was 25 —a
stimulating conversationalist, and seemed
happy enough, though I always had a
feeling for him myself as for one who
had come down in the world. I did not
know that he had been a general news-
paperman before becoming the literary
pundit of The Bulletin and had only
been that for 10 years.
It did not seem to raise his status when
he edited his own “Bookfellow,” his final
phase. Oddly, I never saw his Red Pagan
(published 1904), and there is no copy in
Dunedin’s excellent library. I knew it
well by name, but fancy it could not have
made any great stir.
He told me that, in New Zealand, he
missed more than anything else Sydney’s
cheap wines. He felt fitter here than in
Sydney, and believed that his brain
worked better when his body was less fit
—and less dominating. Also, I remember
his remarking that he liked women’s
poetry because of their self-revelations —•
unconscious confessions . . . the suggestion
was of something a little naive. I re-
member the sense, not his words. A
vigorous, kindly egoist.

SKETCHES OF STEPHENS.
F. J. R.
A. G. Stephens was a frequent visitor
to our home in Queensland while he was
editor of the Gympie “Miner.”
I have been surprised to learn since
that he was then only 23, for, to me, a
girl in her ’teens, he seemed a middle-
aged man. Perhaps his fair, well-
trimmed beard made him seem older,
and he would probably have tried to look
older when he undertook his editorship.
In my old birthday-book his signature,
written in black ink, places his birthday
on August 28. He must have used my
ink, for I do not remember ever having
seen his handwriting in any other than
purple ink. When he was leaving Gympie
for his trip to America he gave me a
copy of Zangwill’s Old Maids’ Club (an
institution for which I am since disquali-
fied) and a copy of Mary Hannay Fbott’s
“Where the Pelican Builds Her Nest,” set
to music. Across it is written “With the
publisher’s compliments” in purple ink.
He also, while in America, sent us a
photograph of himself in macintosh and
helmet taken under Niagara Falls.
As I was brought up in a strictly
puritanical atmosphere, I felt very ad-
venturous when he arrived one Sunday
morning to drive us to a picnic at the
Quarries, a beautiful fern glade five
miles out, over a hilly and very indiffer-
ent road. Dismounting from a double-
seated buggy drawn by a pair of horses
from the livery stables, Stephens an-
nounced “Me Lud, the carriage wait£”
—only he said “cawwiage,” for he had no
“r” in his vocabulary.
I am afraid A G. had little understand-
ing of horses, for when one of the steeds
persisted in walking on his hind legs the
“carriage” was taken back to the stables
and a more amenable pair substituted.
However, we reached the Quarries safely,
and though on our return journey we
were stopped on a hill by some saplings
placed across the road by some of the
boys of our party who were determined
to keep ahead of us, and though, later, as
we sped at breakneck pace down a hill a
woman leading a small boy by the hand
walked leisurely across the road, thereby
causing A.G. to swerve the horses on to
the footpath, bringing the buggy to a
sudden full-stop against the kerbing, we
were able to dismount in safety. We
walked home the rest of the way, and
A.G. took the equipment back to the
stables. I am sure I looked on these
narrowly-averted mishaps as a warning
to spend my Sundays otherwise in
future.
But even in those days Stephens tried
to encourage any literary talent that
might be waiting to blossom. At our
literary circle he read a poem of his own
composing, of which I remember noth-
ing but the title “Under the Wistewia
(wisteria) Bush.” He also read there a
paper on Adam Lindsay Gordon.
Later the local Show committee offered
a prize for the best essay on Gordon.
Wishing to compete and having no other
information except the preface in a cheap
edition of his poems, I asked Stephens
to lend me his essay. In it he had
described the poet’s funeral as over-
shadowed by an approaching thunder-
storm which, as the casket was being
lowered, burst in a fury of pelting rain
and deafening thunder. This I and some
others who had access to the essay faith-
fully reproduced, but even now I remem-
ber Stephens’s chuckle as he told me he
“made that up.”
His handling of the “Red Page”
roused in me an interest which has
caused me ever since to look first at that
page when The Bulletin comes in.
"Black War."
Clive Turnbull’s Black War (Cheshire)
tells the story of the extermination of the
Tasmanian aborigines. As Mr, Turn-
bull says, the whole tragic episode is
epitomised in the life of Truganini, or
Trucanini, who died in 1876 and whose
skeleton lies in “a coffin-like box” in the
basement of the Tasmanian Museum:
King Billy was gone, but Truganini, the
“Beauty of Bruny,” lived on, last of the
Bruny Island tribe, last of all the Tas-
manians in Van Diemen’s Land. Her
uncle had been shot by a soldier, her sister
stolen by sealers, her mother stabbed. Her
man had his hands cut off in life, and her
last compatriot his hands cut off in death.
One by one they had all gone, some shot,
some brained with musket-butts, others
rotted with drink and disease or victims
of strange and horrible clothing. They
had been raped, emasculated, flogged,
roasted and starved. They had been
badgered from place to place, taken from
their country to an unfamiliar island and
brought back to die in the pestiferous ruins
of a jail. The colonists’ lusts had been
succeeded by their hatred, and their hatred,
by their contempt. The “black crows” had
become the “savages” and the savages the
dirty, drunken, flea-ridden blacks. Truganini,
the old woman, .had seen it all, her own
story the very story of her race.
Mr. Turnbull is not yet wholly satisfy-
ing as a historian. There is no discussion
in Black War of the extraordinarily inter-
esting fact that on Cape Barren Island in
Bass Strait, among a population of 262
people engaged chiefly in mutton-birding
and provided with a church and a school,
there are believed to be descendants of
the race which Mr, Turnbull, in his open-
ing sentence, declares to have been “utterly
destroyed.” These particular natives
of Cape Barren Island are not, of course,
full-blooded ; they are said to be descend-
ants of aboriginal women lured or stolen
away by the sealers of the early days,
some from the mainland and some from
Tasmania. But the survival of the Tas-
manian strain, even in this diluted form,
was surely a fact worth mentioning.
Mr. Turnbull gives the impression that
he has been careful to verify his facts,
but that where these would tend to modify
that state of intense moral indignation
in which, as has previously been pointed
out on the Red Page, he habitually writes
on art or history, he becomes somewhat
impatient with them. On the vital ques-
tion of how many Tasmanian aborigines
were destroyed, for instance, he writes:
The number of the native inhabitants at
the time of the first contact with the white
races and of European settlement we have
no means of knowing. It has been placed
as high as 8000 and as low as 700. Other
estimates are 2000 and 7000. Speculation
is futile. AH that we can tell, and all that
here concerns us, is that there was a con-
siderable race of men which had been,
apparently, in undisturbed possession of the
island for centuries.
Though men tend to be impressed by
numbers, the moral difference between ex-
terminating 8000 people and 700 people
may be imperceptible; but the factual
difference is considerable, Mr. Turnbull
has surely read enough on the subject to
be able to say which estimate he con-
siders the most probable.
Readers who will share Mr, Turnbull’s
indignation at the story as a whole—as
everyone must —will find that at many
points he has overstated his case. It is
really very rash to assert that the abo-
rigines were not “in any degree the mental
inferiors of their supplanters”: such a
sweeping generalisation assumes, in the
first place, that all the “supplanters” were
of the same mental attainments. Again,
it is absurd to argue, because one abo-
rigine threw into the sea one bottle of
arrack given him by a member of Baudin’s
crew, that the race as a whole was “dis-
dainful of intoxicating liquor.” It is un-
just to regard the repeated attempts by
the various Governors to avert or modify
the tragedy as mere “face-saving ges-
tures” : the present generation has not, as
a historical fact, a monopoly of the spirit
of humanity. And, finally, it is a pity that
Mr. Turnbull’s most vehement outbursts
of moral indignation should be directed
af the clergy: men who, however misled
by zeal, obviously felt for the aborigines
precisely that sympathy which moves Mr.
Turnbull today.
But whatever may be said in defence of
those who, while acting contrary to the
instructions of Mr. Turnbull —exactly
what those would have been is not quite
clear —did their best to avert a tragedy
that became inevitable from the day when
white settlement was established on the
island, the story remains pitiful, brutal,
moving. It is the history of a race dis-
possessed of its hunting-grounds, forced
into outlawry and, finally, when its ori-
ginal 700 or 8000—the generally-accepted
figure is 2000 —had dwindled to 200,
exiled to an island off the Tasmanian
coast where, partly from disease but
chiefly from despair, it perished.
The significance of the story, as lan
Hogbin points out in his foreword, is for
today: “We still have an aboriginal prob-
lem in Australia The early whites in
Tasmania, considering their background
and the time at which they lived, may on
the final count be morally guiltless; but
the twentieth-century world is unlikely to
treat us of this generation with the same
leniency if we repeat the process of
extermination and kill off the aborigines
of Australia by sheer indifference,”
A Sonnet Sequence.
The characteristic flavor of Professor
Ernest G. Moll’s verse—an idiomatic turn
of speech derived from the American
vernacular and from Robert Frost and
Edward Arlington Robinson —is missing
from his sonnet-sequence The Waterhole
(Angus and Robertson), which, in conse-
quence, is rather flat.
In the colloquial sections Professor
Moll has fallen into the error which has
always made Robert Frost’s longer narra-
tives tepid and unconvincing: the failure
—strange in poets who can adapt the
vernacular to very good effect in the lyric
—not only accurately to reproduce the
terms of the spoken language but, more
importantly, to catch its underlying
rhythms. Australians in the outback do
not use quite the language Professor Moll
puts into their mouths, and they most
certainly do not speak in his dead-flat
pentameters;
“Now that’s what I call progress: start out
poor,
Work hard and take your chances with a smile,
And use your brains to make the business pay.
I tell you, boys, of this I’m bloody sure,
If I can just keep off the booze awhile
I’ll have a place as good as this some day.”
The more ambitious sonnets, where
Professor Moll is writing in the high way
of poetry, come nearer to succeeding. If
one compares, however, a sonnet by
Gerard Manley Hopkins with a typical
example from The Waterhole it is imme-
diately apparent that something is lacking
in Professor Moll’s poetry; something
vital. This is Hopkins :
I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day.
What hours, O what black hours we have spent
This night! what sights you, heart, saw; ways
you went!
And more must, in yet longer light’s delay.
With witness I speak this. But where I say
Hours I mean years, mean life. And my lament
Is cries countless, cries like dead letters sent
To dearest him that lives alas! away.
I am gall, I am heartburn. God’s most deep
decree
Bitter would have me taste: my taste was me;
Bones built in me, flesh filled, blood brimmed
the curse.
Selfyeast of spirit a dull dough scours. I see
The lost are like this, and their scourge to be
As I am mine, their sweating selves; but worse.
And this is Professor Moll:
A woman who in sorrow has retired
Out of the hard and hot and bitter race
Into her own inviolable place
Where none, no matter with what hope inspired,
May follow her, wears, like the dawn new-
fired,
A far and delicate beauty in her face
That makes her —oh, the unutterable grace!—
Warmly and wonderfully to be desired.
Such was the beauty of this spot between
The bitter sky and the wide barren land.
If one had seen it there not quite past reach
Amid the sun-glare lying still and green.
He would have walked toward it with a hand
Pressing his heart, but softly and without speech.
Since The Waterhole is essentially pas-
toral and reflective poetry, one would
not expect it to have the impassioned in-
tensity of Hopkins’s outcry of agony, nor
is Hopkins’s “sprung rhythm” necessary.
But Professor Moll’s lines are padded,
his language is frequently hackneyed,
and throughout the sequence there are
far too many borrowings from standard
poets ranging from Shakspeare to Edna
St, Vincent Millay. In Hopkins’s sonnet
the poet is master of the form; in Pro-
fessor Moll’s sonnet the form is master
of the poet.
The sequence, despite its general tame-
ness, has many attractive lines and
phrases and pleasant pictures of the bush,
its birds, its beasts and its primitive
aboriginals. The thought is clear and
deep, and the 1 story of a bush waterhole
eventually filled-in to make a city race-
course is used to convey Professor Moll’s
whole philosophy. It is an interesting
experiment to use a sequence of sonnets
for a pastoral narrative ; and 98 sonnets
—there are 47 of Wordsworth's
“Ecclesiastical Sonnets”—are an impres-
sive total.
Publishing Experiment
James Cant’s Six Signed Artisfs Prints,
published by the artist and distributed by
the Contemporary Art Society, Sydney,
contains between its large covers of red
board three separate kinds of experiment.
In the first place, it is not an art book
in the ordinary sense of the term, but a
portfolio of six drawings on loose sheets ;
a type of publishing venture which has
rarely, if ever, been attempted in Sydney,
though it is common enough overseas.
The advantages of such a production are
that it can be brought out at much less
cost than a formal art book and that the
drawings, if it is desired, may readily
be framed.
Next, the method of reproduction is
original as far as the art world is con-
cerned. The crayon and pen drawings
are reproduced by the “dyline” process,
which is used by engineering draftsmen
for making copies of their charts and
diagrams: a method of photography
which dispenses with the need for a
negative. The effect is not like a photo-
graph, but simply a facsimile of the
original drawing. The possibilities of the
method for all kinds of black-and-white
reproduction should be worth exploring.
Thirdly, the drawings themselves might
reasonably be termed experimental: they
are concerned with fish, reptiles, birds
and Adam and Eve, done in the style of
aboriginal drawings, with surrealist in-
tention. Since Mr. Cant is neither an
aboriginal nor Adam, but an intellectual
of the twentieth century who has studied
art in Sydney and in Europe, it is difficult
to understand why he tries to draw as
if he belonged to the Stone Age. It
would be much more sensible if a Stone
Age man tried to draw as Mr. Cant
probably can draw when he is not bark-
ing up the wrong gum-tree, or gumming
up the wrong bark.
Still, when he has put his drawings
into a portfolio, Mr. Cant obviously be-
lieves in their validity; there is a school
of opinion which would agree with him;
and it may be admitted that, if they could
be regarded as the works of a surrealist
aboriginal, the drawings would be not
unattractive in their primitive simplicity*
The edition is limited to 150 copies.
Two Lyrics.
I.
I strayed with Eros on a cool
honey-soft and clovered hilh
He led me down where dewy briars?
cider-sweetness teased the air,
from shadow up to burning beam
close by water’s glass-bright gleam.
I saw the smoke of chimneypots
entangled in those fingertops,
I felt the flowing forms arise
in those visionary eyes.
Bees at harvest. Blossom abounding.
A bridal thorn my breath confounding.
Drenched in honey-sunlight still
drowsing on the stirless hill
no word we spake. What deep in clover
word should break that golden weather ?
Still splendor throbbed. A thrush in a tree
fluttered unsinging: so silent we.
II:
I dreamt I walked on billowed cloud.
There seemed a voice that called aloud.
I turned. A solemn angel there
Greeted me. His speech was fair.
He took me wisely by the hand.
He said that I should understand.
There was a key. He gave a lock.
I dreamt 1 wrote this in a book.

What is the cause of sleepwalking?
Sleepwalking is one of the neuroses
of deep sleep, really an acted dream.
The exciting causes are usually mental
excitement, overwork, bodily fatigue
or digestive disorders; it is met with
chiefly in persons of nervous tempera-
ment or those who have an inherited
proclivity to neurotic disease; nobody
who is in perfect health walks in his
sleep. An important point is that a
sleepwalker found wandering should
not be roughly awakened but led
back to bed as gently as possible.

Some details concerning the painters
(1) Georges Rouault and (2) Dattilo -
Rubbo?
(1) He was born Paris, May 27,
1871, and his work is marked by a
satirical and religious outlook. He is
regarded as a superb colorist, in the
Expressionist manner, his art repre-
senting a revolt against the academic
standards of his day. It was during
his early studies at the Ecole des
Beaux-Arts under Gustave Moreau, a
teacher whom he has always regarded
with the warmest affection, that his
well-known work, “The Child Jesus
Among the Doctors,” was painted.
His later work departed from this
early style and became strongly
modernistic. (2) Anthony Dattilo-
Rubbo, bom Naples, Italy, 1871,
studied in Rome and Naples before
coming to Australia in 1897. Was for
many years art instructor with the
Royal Art Society of N.S.W., later
starting njs own school. He is a

What are the uses of tung oil?
Tung oil, or Chinese wood oil, is
used in the manufacture of paints and
varnishes. In China it is used for
polishing, preserving and waterproof-
ing wood, for waterproofing cloth,
paper umbrellas and bamboo netting,
and throughout Asia as an ingredient
in the manufacture of putty. In the
remote districts of China it is used
as lamp oil. Lampblack for India
ink is also made from tung oil. The
oil is used medicinally in China for the
treatment of boils, ulcers, swellings
and burns. Best-known and most ex-
tensive use is in the manufacture of
waterproofing varnishes, enamels and
paints, but it also serves in the manu-
facture of rubber substitutes, linoleum
and cellulose lacquers.

SAINT JOSEPH'S DAY
BY E. O. Schlunke
WHEN Alex Denholm first saw
the Italian prisoners-of-war
arriving at the cottage where his
three men, Maringoni, Veracini
and Rizzio, lived, he was annoyed because
they were breaking military regulations,
and putting him into an awkward position.
But he was even more surprised than
annoyed.
At least twenty men had arrived at the
same time. Alex’s sheepdogs barked at
them in a fury of suspicion, and his two
small sons hung over the houseyard fence
to see what was happening. They
trooped into the cottage in a serious
manner, closing the door. But their
voices carried to the house, in a general
tumult. Above it there arose, every now
and then, poignant exclamations, voices
accusing, voices denying, voices enraged
and voices despairing. Sometimes the
door would fly open and a bunch of three
or four dash out as if they needed more
air and space to express themselves.
They would gather into a tight little
circle, shake fists and shout at each other,
mill around, and then, quite unaccount-
ably, all suddenly dash inside again.
Ina, spending an uneventful week-end
on duty and pining for all the things
Which she knew were happening to other
young girls at this very moment in more
exciting places, spied on the prisoners
through the pantry window, and shouted
reports to Mrs. Denholm, Mrs. Den-
holm, ever aware that the prisoners Md
quite recently been enemy soldiers, needed
little encouragement to become alarmed.
She sought out Alex in his den, closely
followed by Ina.
“The Italians are plotting some mis-
chief,” she said, her worried, pale-blue
eyes accusing him, “and you’ll be blamed
for allowing them to congregate at your
place. What if they’re planning to make
an escape? They might raid our house
to get civilian clothes, and what could
you do against so many? They might
murder all of us.” Then she glanced at
Ina’s voluptuous young figure and added,
“or worse.”
“Don’t worry. They get excited about
any little thing,” Alex said soothingly.
But Mrs. Denholm was not to be
soothed.
“They’ll be late getting back to their
farms, and you’ll be blamed. The other
farmers are always saying that the
prisoners do anything they like here.”
Alex looked at her searchingly, a
troubled frown on his face. She didn’t
understand the subtleties of his system—
how much he gained from his prisoners’
enthusiasm and their concern for his
interests, because he refrained from the
constant rigid supervision practised by
some of his neighbors.
“I’ll go and talk to them,” he said,
dubiously.
THEY were all inside the cottage, so he
knocked on the door. All the talking
stopped like a tap turned off. Maringoni
came to the door and gave a rather
sheepish smile on seeing his employer.
But instantly he became the polite host.
He bowed Alex into the room where all
the prisoners were sitting on all the old
discarded furniture which he and Vera-
cini had repaired. All the men sprang
up and Alex was ushered to the seat of
highest honor, a massive old leather arm-
chair.
Standing beside the chair, as if he had
just got out of it, and not very willingly,
either, was a fat, oily-faced prisoner
whom Alex knew quite well. It was
Giuseppe Carofilio from his neighbor
Krantz’s place; a sly, lazy fellow who,
nevertheless, had won a position of high
favor with his bachelor employer through
his excellent cooking.
Although Giuseppe offered the chair tq
Alex, he did it without that spontaneous
eagerness characteristic of the polite
Italian eager to make a good impression ;
there was also a slightly sullen down-
curving of his mouth and evasiveness of
his eyes which seemed to indicate to
Alex that, if the fortunes of war had
been reversed, Giuseppe would have had
great pleasure in emptying him out of
the seat.
Alex sat down and looked around.
The men stood, silent and uncertain in
the red uniform of the vanquished.
Maringoni introduced the strangers and
there was another uncomfortable lull.
The room was hot from the overcrowd-
ing. Alex began to wish he hadn’t come
in, after all. Alex was a fastidious man.
Besides, in a mass the Italians appeared
uncomfortably foreign, not at all
like his own three men when he
had them by themselves. Alex had
a strong impression that he had
interrupted something excessively
important; there was suppressed
urgency in all the mobile brown
faces around him and it flashed in
a variety of dark eyes.
Alex tried to make a little, friendly
conversation as he always did with
visiting prisoners, but the usual flow
of cordiality did not develop. He
began to think that his wife might be
right and that they rea’lly were plotting
some mischief. Then he caught Marin-
goni’s eye, and the expression was re-
vealingly like one of his sheepdogs when
expecting a reprimand.
He searched all the other faces and
knew that they had sensed hostility in
his intrusion, even though he was not
sure of it himself. He made a quick
decision, that, if they expected to be
reprimanded, they must deserve it. It
seemed to be an occasion when the pres-
tige of the employers was in his hands.
So he told them firmly, but not unkindly,
that they should not have collected* in
such numbers, and that the authorities
would punish them if they heard of it.
At that they streamed out of the room
with rather persecuted expressions. They
grabbed their bicycles and horses and
shouted a rivederci to each other. Alex said
a rivederci also and returned to the house.
He had just settled himself comfortably
again when Mrs. Denholm, still followed
by Ina, came in to report plaintively that
the prisoners were defying him and not
going home.
“The knives will start to fly any
minute,” said Ina, who couldn’t get the
popular reputation of Italians out of her
mind.
Alex looked from her foolishly excited
face through the window and saw that
the men had regrouped and were arguing
as tensely as before. He started for the
door, feeling annoyed.
“Take a gun with you,” Mrs. Denholm
urged, her voice full of concern.
But as soon as the prisoners saw him
they dispersed quickly.
“It just shows what guilty consciences
they have,” said Ina,
'T' HAT night the men came filing in for
* tea in their usual order. First Marin-
goni, looking just a little more suave
than usual; Veracini with his worried
mechanic’s face, now, despite his fair
hair and blue eyes, looking distinctly
Italian for once, because he was still
excited ; dark Rizzio yvith his Southern
ill manners, sticking out his lower lip
and shouldering the others as if he had
sustained some injury to his pride among
all the Northerners.
Alex, by way of demanding some ex-
planation, said to Maringoni, in the
common argot:
“Plenty discordo in casa today.”
Maringoni studied him appraisingly,
then his eyes swivelled round to the
Italians and they exchanged the most
significant glances. Whereon Maringoni
turned to Alex again with a disarming
smile, his voice full of the politest modu-
lations and shaking his head slowly from
side to side.
“No discordo, Meestair, ma discorso,’’
he said.
Alex looked at him very suspiciously.
For a discourse it had sounded singularly
violent.
“Plenty contradizione, plenty guerilla,”
he said. Mrs. Denholm and Ina looked
on in dramatic silence.
“Contradizione,” Maringoni admitted.
“Ma no guerilla.' Plenti amabilita.”
Alex continued to stare at him so in-
credulously that the men became quite
crestfallen. They began to talk to each
other in quick, soft voices, crouching
lower over their plates and rolling their
eyes secretively. Then Maringoni said,
with the air of a man who is going to
make a clean breast of the whole matter:
“On next Sunday is Fiesta San
Giuseppe.”
Alex began to laugh. He knew that
about one out of every four of the
prisoners was named Giuseppe, and
realised that they wanted to organise some
sort of celebration, despite the difficul-
ties of their circumstances. He could
imagine most of the rest.
The prisoners looked very relieved.
They began to talk excitedly, each trying
to be the first to tell the most. The cele-
bration Was to take the form of a feast
at “farm Meestair Krantz” because “he
like plenti eat Italy.” Krantz’s man Giu-
seppe Carofilio was to be the chief cook,
but each prisoner had to contribute his
share of the raw material. (Some hesi-
tation here, because the only way they
could get the material was by the grace
of their employers.)
They talked of the food; spaghetti,
meat dish and four big cakes made of
yeast dough with lots of raisins flavored
with wine. (The wine was to be pro-
vided by one of the prisoners whose em-
ployer had promised him two bottles if
it rained two inches within the next
week ; none of them seemed to have con-
sidered seriously the possibility of the
rain not falling.)
As soon as the men had left the room
Mrs. Denholm turned on Alex, looking
very little happier now that the plot had
been proved harmless.
“Captain Pillory will never give them
permission to have their fiesta,” she said,
as if she was glad of his solid, dependable
authority.
“Possibly not,” said Alex. “So I don’t
suppose that they intend to ask for it.”
Consternation appeared on Mrs. Den-
holm’s face.
POURING the next days the men were
cheerful and well behaved. Mar-
ingoni, digging in the vegetable garden,
told Alex how they celebrated the Fiesta
San Giuseppe in Ferrara. There jvas
dancing in the streets, flowers by the
truck-load and pretty girls in hundreds.
Then he drew Alex’s attention to his dis-
coveries ; a pumpkin overlooked among
the litter, and a bunch of eschalots his
industrious spade had uncovered. The
vegetables were donated to the fiesta.
Veracini, who had worked in the
F.I.A.T. factory at Turin, said that the
management always gave a bonus of five
lire to each men to provide something
special for Saint Joseph’s Day, though
he, Veracini, usually spent his allowance
at* the cinema (he was very fond of
Deanna Durbin).
Then, as Alex failed to rise to the
occasion, Veracini told him in a round-
about way that if he had no use for-this
piece of Oregon it could be fashioned into
the special kind of rolling-pin the Italians
used for making 1 spaghetti.
On Rizzio’s farm in Calabria they made
a very special feast on San Giuseppe Day
because his father, his oldest brother and
his mother’s brother were all named
Giuseppe. They always had a lamb,
though most Italians had lamb only for
Easter. And they drank the very best
keg of their own wine. The men had at
least a gallon each. In the afternoon
they had a good sleep, and joined in the
religious procession in the village in the
evening. He was killing the ration sheep
while he told Alex this, and Alex allowed
him to put by all sorts of spare parts
which were usually thrown to the dogs.
But on Saturday night, after they had
all their contributions neatly done up for
transportation in the morning, the dogs
barked furiously and Alex caught a
glimpse of a furtive cyclist arriving at the
cottage door.
ON Sunday morning the men came in
late for breakfast, all with dull hope-
less eyes, hanging underlips and sagging
shoulders, looking pathetically and in-
curably dejected. Maringoni alone had
sufficient spirit to explain briefly that
there had been “discordo on farm Mee-
stair Krantz,” that the chief cook, Giu-
seppe, was in the “calaboose” and Krantz
was threatening to shoot any prisoner
who came within shotgun range of his
farm.
All that day there was morbid inaction
at the cottage. Rizzio was the only one
to do his washing, and he never washed
very much. Alex gave them a bottle of
wine to cheer them up, but after trying
very hard to refuse, they carried it off
as if they expected it to poison them.
On Monday morning Ina came back
from her week-end with a look in her
eye of having had very satisfactory enter-
tainment. She was dressed in a crisply
clean' frock of brilliant colors, with a
luscious purple ribbon round her blue-
black hair. But the prisoners took no
notice of her as they filed in disconso-
lately for their breakfast. She stood and
stared at them.
“My word, you have got a set of hang-
overs,” she said. “Was the spaghetti
too tough for you?”
The men said nothing, merely looking
sadder. Mrs. Denholm explained what
had happened.
“Don’t make fun of them, they have
had a great disappointment,” she said.
Immediately Ina’s bold jeering look
turned to one of lavish sympathy.
“You poor miserable little Ities,” she
said. “So you didn’t have your feresta
after all.”
Maringoni looked at her briefly and
gave his head a slow fatalistic shake. Ina
turned to her employers in great concern.
“But they gotter have their feresta. They
were looking forward to it so much.”
“Prigionaire no possibile fiesta. No
good prigionaire.” This from Veracini,
in a curt and uncompromising manner.
“Very good dead,” he added and
looked at his tableknife with morbid in-
tensity. Ina was horrified.
“You don’t need to get that down-
hearted. Why can’t you have your
feresta next Sunday?”
Maringoni made his hopeless gesture
again.
“No Giuseppe. No farm Meestair
Krantz.”
Ina looked contemptuous.
“You don’t hafter have Giuseppe.
You’re always skiting about how well
you can cook. And you can have the
feresta here.”
She glanced at Alex, not because she
realised that she was taking liberties, but
to invite his support. Maringoni wriggled
uncomfortably.
“No possibile. Meestair Den’oom one
grand signor. No speak permesso.”
Ina turned to Alex with aggressive con-
fidence.
“But you will let them have their
feresta here? They won’t hurt you.”
ALEX saw the men’s eyes turned to
him, all now convinced that there
was really no sound reason why the
fiesta should not be held at his place.
He realised that it was quite impossible
to make them understand that he wasn’t
like Mr. Krantz ; that he just didn’t have
fiestas at his place for various reasons
connected with his prestige ; his neigh-
bors’ ideas of the necessity of keeping
the prisoners in their place, and his wife’s
fears and animosity.
“Me pensare,” he said, ambiguously,
intending that his “thinking” should be
devoted to finding a way out without
offending his men too much. “Difficile,”
he added. “Ufficiale no permesso. Ma-
rne try. Me provare, tentare.”
The three men looked at him earnestly;
all quite obviously certain that .the
“ufficiale” would not be consulted, and
trying to decide what he meant to do.
Alex found it hard to meet their dis-
cerning eyes.
It was Maringoni’s job to split the
firewood and bring it to the kitchen
verandah, and Mrs. Denholm’s barometer
of the prisoners’ behavior was the
promptness of the wood’s delivery and
the size of the pieces.
Today the men seemed to have just
gone when Maringoni was back with the
wheelbarrow piled high with the finest
split wood. He carried some right in
to the kitchen, put a piece - on the fire,
and asked Mrs. Denholm if there was
anything more he could do for her. Mrs.
Denholm smiled to herself. She had
heard him tell 'Alex that in Italy the
fnen were the masters.
To Alex the men were embarrassingly
respectful. Whenever they saw him they
watched him with a kind of suppressed
expectancy in their faces, as tense as if
they were holding their breaths. So
diligently they listened to his instructions,
so readily understanding even if he told
them to do something they normally dis-
liked, so quickly and faithfully they per-
formed their jobs and always coming
back for more, no matter how late,
AT the breakfast table, when Alex told
his wife the arrangements for the
day, they watched closely although they
couldn’t understand much of what was
said, as if trying to estimate her influ-
ence on him. And every morning the
wood continued to arrive in great barrow-
loads until a huge surplus piled
on the verandah, all meticulously split to
Mrs. Denholm’s standard.
By Wednesday night Alex was begin-
ning to feel brutal from seeing hope and
despair continually harassing his men.
He told them at the tea table that he
would telephone the other farmers that
night, and let them know the decision in
the morning.
Maringoni said, “Oh, tank you, mees-
tair,” very gratefully, and then turned to
Mrs. Denholm and said: “Tank you,
Madame,” making it sound like a plea
for compassion.

PARADISE DISDAINED.
By way of showing what
would have happened to the un-
willing Soviet schoolteachers if
their country’s Consul in New
York had been able to enforce
their return to Russia, the U.S.
press has featured this extract
from the Soviet Criminal Code
(1947):
1. Refusal by a Soviet citizen who
is an official of a Government agency
or enterprise of the U.S.S.R. active
, abroad to comply with the request
to return to the confines of the
U.S.S.R. shall be regarded as a flight
to the camp of the enemies of the
working class and the peasantry and
shall be qualified as treason.
2. Persons who refuse to return to
the U.S.S.R. shall be declared out-
laws.
3. Outlawing shall entail:
A. Confiscation of all property of
the convicted person.
B. SHOOTING HIM TO DEATH
WITHIN 24 HOURS AFTER THE
— St. Louis (U.S.A.) “Post-Dispatch.”
WINTER’S ALLIES.
IDENTIFICATION OF HIS PER-
SON.
There are hundreds of Rus-
sians in America to whom that
would apply, and, counting in
all those Russia claims as its
citizens, there are hundreds of
thousands more elsewhere. A
“Christian Science Monitor”
Washington report quotes official
figures showing 140,000 Balts
who have fled since Moscow ab-
sorbed their homelands. Also
(official figures) “28,000 Yugo-
slavs, 26,000 Poles and 8000
Czechs so far have fled their
homeland in the wake of Soviet
domination.”
As a Bulletin “Plain Eng-
lish” article recently indicated,
Australia is getting a careful
selection from these, and there
is certainly good quality among
them. One of them, writing
from Austria, has given in a
London “Times” letter an in-
teresting account of a special
high-quality section that any
country ought to be glad to get
—the persecuted former mem-
bers of Parliaments in the vari-
ous satellite countries; political
refugees because, having carried
on the fight against Nazi domi-
nation, they were no better liked
by the subsequent Communist
totalitarians. The writer, Frank
Palinay, states:
“There are no separate Hun-
garian, Polish, Czech, etc., wars
against Communism: they all
form part of the same immense
struggle of humanity and true
democratic principles against
Eastern barbarism. While we
were doing our bit in our coun-
tries we considered ourselves
fighters of the very same cause,
and as such we were patted on
the back by the Western press
and wireless. As the Russian
grip got tighter some of us were
tortured and killed, some of us
were imprisoned, while some of
us managed to escape, leaving
everything behind. We crossed
the frontier of our fatherland
like hounded game, marching
endless miles through mountains
and dark forests, carrying our
children in the night. Reaching
free soil at last, we expected to
find comrades who under better
circumstances were working for
the same ideals and the same
supreme interests of mankind.
But there we found no sympathy
and neither material nor moral
support.
“A minimum of financial
assistance would mean a lot to
these derelicts of the political
battlefields of our times, but
moral support would have an
even greater effect. If these
political refugees were to receive
preferential treatment as regards
visas, landing permits, shipment,
etc., thus facilitating their re-
settlement in some part of the
free world, that would mean
very much to them. Every
country is considering its moral
duty to give some assistance to
its returned soldiers. What about
the veterans of the present cold
war against Bolshevism?”
In N. Y. “Herald Tribune”
a competent military authority
is quoted as estimating that
the Russians in the Western
occupation zones in Germany
alone may be “15,000 or even
20,000, ranging from Russian
privates to generals and top
bureaucrats and administrators.
In the early years after the war,
this flight west from the Soviet
zones of occupation was almost
a flood. About a year ago, the
Soviet authorities began to take
stern measures to stop the flow.
Soviet occupation troops were
confined to well-guarded bar-
racks. Families were returned
to the Soviet Union as potential
hostages.”
That mass migration—“it is
deeply significant that so great
a number should have risked
their lives to escape the iron grip
of the Soviet system”—is merely
a small percentage of the “Soviet
citizens who have, by hook or by
crook, managed to avoid return-
ing to the Soviet Union since
the war.” These, it should be
re-emphasised, are Russians, not
satellite people.
The “Herald-Tribune” report
adds that there is no way to esti-
mate the total number of these
people, simply because they have
been able to keep out of the
Soviet Union only by success-
•fully camouflaging their identi-
ties. But “estimates range as
high as half a million, and cer-
tainly the total is well up in six
figures.”
When the war ended, states
the report, a mass forging of
papers by Soviet nationals took
place. As a result, there are
now thousands and thousands of
Soviet citizens in the displaced-
persons camps, disguised as
Balts or Poles or Turks or Ar-
menians or what not. And
many thousands more are living
in the cities, often hiding under
two or three false identities at
once. They include professors,
scientists, generals, journalists,
administrators —men who have
achieved real distinction in the
Soviet State itself. “These
people live somehow from day
to day, without the legal right to
exist, like so many ghosts.”
“Freedom of Privacy.”
A thoughtful comment on
“the precious freedom of pri-
vacy” is contained in the fol-
lowing dissent of Justice Frank-
furter in a five-to-four decision
in favor of Jehovah’s Witnesses
after that body had appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court against
the ruling of a police chief who
refused them permission to
operate a sound-truck in a pub-
lic park in Lockport, N.Y. Said
the dissenting Judge:
“The appellant’s loudspeakers
blared forth in a small park
about 1600 ft. long and from 250
to 400 ft. wide, used primarily
for recreation and containing
benches, picnic and athletic
facilities and a children’s wad-
ing-pool and playground. Esti-
mates of the range of the sound
equipment varied from 200 to
600 ft. The attention of a large
fraction of the area of the park
was thus commanded.
“The native power of human
speech can interfere little with
the self-protection of those who
do not wish to listen. They
may easily move beyond ear-
shot, just as those who do not
choose to read need not have
their attention bludgeoned by
undesired reading-matter. And
st> utterance by speech or pen
can neither be forbidden nor
licensed, save in the familiar
classes of exceptional situations.
“But modern devices for am-
plifying the range and volume
of the voice, or its recording,
afford easy, too easy, opportuni-
ties for aural aggression. If un-
controlled the result is intrusion
into cherished privacy. The re-
freshment of mere silence, or
meditation, or quiet conversa-
tion may be disturbed or pre-
cluded by noise beyond one’s
personal control.
“Municipalities have con-
scientiously sought to deal with
the new problem to which sound
equipment has given rise, and
have devised various methods of
control to make city life endur-
able, And so I cannot agree
that we must deny the right of a
State to control these broadcast-
ing devices so as to safeguard
the right of others not to be
assailed by intrusive noise but to
be free to put their freedom of
mind and attention to uses of
their own choice.”
Choice for Tito.
Spread of the Tito revolt
against complete domination by
Moscow has been considered by
many keen observers one of the
strongest deterrents of any
Soviet-launched war.*
The spread is seen by a lead-
ing N. Y. “Times” correspondent
in Europe as much more wide-
spread than has yet come out.
With varying force, the Tito
example is having its influence
in most of the “Iron Curtain”
countries.
Tito himself the correspondent
sees as having only the two
obvious choices —either to get
back in the Kremlin fold or join
the West. “The first is wellnigh
impossible in view of the past
torrent of excoriation. The
second would risk Soviet military
intervention. The wily Yugoslav
marshal is stalling for time right
now, but he must almost cer-
tainly adopt one course —risking
his own life and condemning his
future —or the other —risking his
nation—before another year has
passed.”
The other satellites “are
eagerly watching Tito to see if
he can get away with it,” the
probable upshot being that the
Kremlin will bring “overwhelm-
mg pressure” to bear on Tito.
“Only thus can the dangerous
spark of internal diversionism be
extinguished in other satellite
minds.”
Other correspondents in
Yugoslavia, however, see no
Tito swing to the West. Articles
in the Belgrade Communist
paper “Borba,” credited to Tito
himself, have been quoted by
N. Y. “Herald Tribune” and
other U.S. correspondents in
Belgrade as defending the Yugo-
slav position in opposing com-
plete domination by Moscow,
but at the same time “reaffirm-
ing in the strongest terms that
Yugoslavia is an ally of the
Soviet Union, will co-operate
with it, will pursue the same
policies, and will stand with
the Soviet bloc in all cases.
Yugoslavia will offer no politi-
cal concessions to the Western
Powers, no matter how pressing
her current difficulties,”
Atomic Centres.
Bird’s-eye mapping of present
world atomic developments, con-
densed from N. Y. “Journal-
American”:
The deposits that are produc-
ing significant amounts of
uranium ores are located .at
Great Bear Lake, Canada;
Colorado and Utah, U.S.A.;
Katanga in the Belgian Congo ;
Joanchimsthal in Czechoslo-
vakia, Cornwall in England and
Urgeirica in Portugal.
Large thorium deposits are
located at Vitoria in Brazil and
Travancore, India. The Rus-
sians are reported to be working
uranium or thorium deposits in
Czechoslovakia, Silesia, Saxony,
Manchuria and whatever de-
posits may have been found
within the Soviet Union itself.
Only three countries —United
States, Canada and Britain —are
known to have atomic ovens or
piles to produce useful atomic
fuel out of uranium or thorium.
The U.S. production-piles are at
Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Hanford,
Wash. Canada’s big production
and research centre, with an
operating pile, is at Chalk River.
Britain’s big centra are at Har-
well and Cambridge, and Britain
has two piles, both operating.
France is building a pile at its
atomic laboratory at Chatillon,
near Paris.
Weapons-production in the
U.S. is centred at Los Alamos,
N.M. The other great U.S. re-
search centres are the Argonne
National Laboratory, Chicago ;
the University of California at
Berkeley; the Knolls Atomic
Power Laboratory, Schenectady,
N.Y.; and centres at Miamis-
burg, O.; lowa State College,
Ames, lowa ; and the University
of Rochester.*
Where Russian research cen-
tres are located never has been
publicly disclosed. Most Ameri-
can scientists do not believe
Russia has an atomic pile in
operation.
Many other countries are con-
ducting research in atomic
energy, among them Sweden,
Norway and Switzerland, but
their special facilities for such
work are limited. A growing
number of countries, however,
are doing research with radio-
isotopes produced in the Oak
Ridge pile.
These “tagged” atoms so far
are the only peace-time atomic
products, and are being used in

ceive them, and Iceland and

different research projects are
being conducted with isotopes
produced by the Atomic Energy
Commission,
Favoring Spain.
Back from personally investi-
gating the general set-up in
Europe, U.S. Senator Gurney
(described by N. Y. “Times” as
“one of Washington’s most
powerful figures in military
policy”) came out strongly for
an American policy of “full
cordiality and accord toward
the Franco Government of
Spain.”
In that, the Senator was
adding his influential voice to
what has been noticed for some
time as an increasing tendency
in the U.S. For his own part,
Senator Gurney stressed that he
intended to make every effort/
in every quarter, to bring about
full recognition of Spain in the
“quickest possible” time. “From
a practical standpoint,' and due
to the fact that the Spanish
people are definitely our friends,
we should not leave a stone un-
turned to get back on a friendly
basis with them. It is not up to
us to tell any other country
what sort of Government it shall.
Mve.”
Senator Gurney said he
favored “Spain’s admission to
the Western European defensive
alliance, her inclusion in the
European Recovery Programme
and a grant to her of United
States military aid if the proper
arrangements for this could be
made.”
Another leading public figure,
former U.S, Postmaster-General
and Democratic National chair-
man James A. Farley, also re-
cently returned from Europe
convinced that “enlightened
self-interest requires that the
United States policy in Spain
should be amended,” whatever
other countries in Europe may
think. “Since visiting Spain,”
he said, “I have often wondered
what would have happened if the
Communists were in control,
with the Pyrenees as a fortress
looking down the throat of
Europe and with the Com-
munists looking down from
Gibraltar at the throat of the
Mediterranean.”
Also typical of the developing
pro-Spain attitude, George E.
Sokolsky comments in N. Y.
“Sun”:—
“Ultimately, we shall be
forced to use Spain as much as
the Spanish Government will
permit us because the Iberian
Peninsula remains for us, as it
was for Wellington, the best en-
trance into Europe
“From this standpoint, it is
now essential that the American
people recognise the fact that we
have to do business with Franco
in Spain. We need Spain.
Franco controls Spain. That is
all we need to know about it.
“For years Franco has been
denounced as a Fascist, and I
assume that he is one. Cer-
tainly he does not operate what
we have learned to call a demo-
cratic Government. Neither did
Stalin in 1933 when Roosevelt
recognised Soviet Russia ; nor in
1941 when we joined Russia as
an ally; nor in the subsequent
years when we gave Russia
$11,000,000,000... .When we
were fighting Germany and
Japan we were willing to do
business with Stalin the argu-
ment of those who insisted upon
our alliance with the godless,
Asiatic, materialistic Russians
syas that we needed them to kill
Germans. Today we need Spain
in our preparedness for war
against Russia. The deeper we
plough through the mire of
European politics the more
‘allies’ we have to take on. If
some prove to be brambles it is
part of that situation.
“There does not seem to be
any alternative to this proposi-
tion, and the United States had
— N. Y. “World-Telegram
ON HIS OWN HOOK:
better not waste time concerning
it. The time between war and
peace may be short or long, but
the time for preparation is im-
mediate Spain is an item in
preparedness.”
As another typical example
of this U.S. swing towards
Spain, the following comments
by Scripps - Howard foreign
editor William Philip Simms: —•
“Spain is [now] assuming
more and more importance in
the defence outlook of the West.
“Russia spearheaded the drive
against Spain from the begin-
ning. In San Francisco, Spain
was kept out of the United
Nations on the grounds that she
had collaborated with the Axis.,
Yet official German documents
published by the State Depart-
ment show that Russia did far"
more for Hitlerite Germany
than Spain ever did. Spain did
little more than pay lip-service.
Russia gave Hitler the green
light for war against the de-
mocracies in 1939, and remained
virtually an ally until mid-
summer of 1941.
“Western Europe and the
United States have gone along
with Russia in ostracising Spain.
This is all to the good for
Russia. For Spain might now
be a big help with the Marshall
Plan, and without Spain as a
base and the Pyrenees as a line
of defence the Red Army could
soon occupy all Europe.
“There is no chance that
Spain will be admitted to the
United Nations. Russia will see
to that. But she may find a way
into some collateral activities.
“There is increasing likeli-
hood of some kind of accord be-
tween Spain, the United States
and Western Europe. There are
reports of impending internal
changes in Spain which would
facilitate such a move. In any
case, it is unlikely Washington
will act alone.”
Challenge to Europe.
Taking a detached view of it,
N. Y. “Times” sees the present
state of Europe as “wholly un-
necessary and even ridiculous.”
■ For, it points out, Western
Europe outside the Iron Curtain
still comprises nearly 300,000,000
highly-educated, highly-skilled
and highly-industrialised people,
with combined resources and a
combined production that have
equalled and could again equal
those of the United States:
“Yet these people, who be-
tween them have represented for
centuries the cultural and power
centre of the Western world, and
who, united, could still form the
strongest Power in the world,
stand today in fear and trem-
bling before a still largely primi-
tive empire of greater territorial
extent but with a far smaller and
equally divided population held
together only by the terror of a
ruthless dictatorship. And only
the power and aid of the United
States now save them from
sharing the fate of the East-
European brethren.”
In this situation, what the
peoples of Europe are con-
fronted with is “not a break-
down of the capitalistic system,
as the Communists and Socialists
would persuade it, but with a
breakdown of its system of
national States equivalent to the
breakdown of the city States of
the Middle Ages, which also had
to yield to larger economic and
defensive units. That Europe it-
self is beginning to realise this is
evidenced by the numerous
.movements, both private and
official, looking toward Euro-
pean federation.”
It is “a challenge to their
vaunted intelligence and their
instinct for survival.”
Socialist Sample.
However small the output of
planned Socialist economies,
they are at least prolific in the
mass production of evidence in
favor of free enterprise. The
latest sample, offered by Britain
and eagerly snapped up by
America, is the hamstringing of
the exchange of information on
methods of production.
Before the planners took over
in Britain that exchange was.
natural, unfettered and anything
but one-sided. Many American
industrial methods were based
on British ideas, and U.S. in-
dustrialists were still able and
willing to learn from Britain.
Research experts from both
countries crossed the Atlantic to
their mutual advantage. The
passing of that useful trade is
well recorded by “Wall-street
Journal”;
“In the process of negotia-
tions on the European Recovery
Programme, Paul Hoffman sug-
gested that British industry
seek the advice of Americans
on production methods. Staf-
ford Cripps accepted. Immedi-
ately the whole matter seems to
have become one of high State
policy, with Cripps under attack
in Parliament.
“There you have again one of
the absurd results of the cen-
trally-managed economy. A
man with a factory in England
could come to America and see
what his American counterpart
was doing, and no one thought
anything of it. When the Gov-
ernment controls, or becomes
the principal director of in-
dustry, what was a simple
matter becomes surrounded by
•questions of national prestige to
be gravely considered in Parlia-
ment, and if the mutually bene-
ficial exchange of information
takes place at all it will take
place in the midst of red-tape
and bureaucratic fol-de-rol.
“For years England bought
the bacon and dairy products of
Denmark. The transactions
were arranged by a few com-
mercial travellers or by an ex-
change of cables. The British
Government became the buyer.
Then whole delegations must
make a formal trip, and instead
of buying bacon and butter their
conferences run off into inter-
national politics. Not being able
to resolve these matters, the
whole thing falls through and
the people of England have less
food and the people of Den-
mark no customers.
“It is very difficult to suppress
the natural instinct of people to
make and grow things and to
trade with other people. The
managed economy has done that.
So far as we can see, that is its
only outstanding accomplish-
ment,’* «

Time-Payment Control. Most
noticeable effect of U.S. control over
time-payment systems has been a
slump in used-car prices, cuts averag-
ing ,about $lOO and ranging up to
$2OO. The controls, designed to

Nationalised Doctors. —Dr. W. T. S.
Stallybrass, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford
University, on Britain’s National
Health Act: “One result of the Act
is that the doctor of public patients
now has two duties —one to the
patient and one to the State. That
has a bearing on the old question of
whether a doctor should tell. At
present, I understand that registration
forms are open to inspection by any
member of a regional board, so it fol-
lows that an employer serving on a
regional board could discover informa-
tion detrimental to an employee. It is of
vital importance that communications
made to a doctor are known to be
confidential. Even in criminal cases
doctors should not be detectives; and
in civil cases the interests of society
are better served if doctors received
unhampered information from their
patients, rather than it be felt that
the information might be disclosed to
others.”

gratitude: “The present strength of
the force is 15,000 against a pre-war
normal of 20,000. Yet with three-
quarters strength it had to deal with
127,000 crimes of all sorts in 1947
compared with 95,000 in 1938... .30.9
per cent, of crimes were completely
cleared up in 1947 against 27 per cent,
in 1938. The number of crimes
cleared up per policeman has nearly
doubled since 1933.”

European Commitments. Duff
Cooper on the Empire view, in a
letter to London “Times”: “Surely
from the point of view of the Domin-
ions it is better that Great Britain
should be strong on the Continent
of Europe rather than remain a
perilously situated island, a lonely
outpost which the ■ waters of the
English Channel can no longer pro-
tect? It is wrong to suppose—and
it is becoming a common error —
that Great Britain has to choose
between Europe and her Empire. So
far as I am aware not one of our
- Imperial statesmen from oversea has
ever supported such a view. We have
already a treaty of alliance with
France, By which no Dominion is
committed, but to which no Dominion
has objected. An isolated Britain, is
a liability to the Empire, which may
be called upon to defend her, while
she becomes yearly less defensible;
but a Britain that shall be the heart
and soul of a great European com-
bination will prove a bulwark upon
which the Empire can rely.”

SHADES OF GOEBBELS!
On the bill before the Federal Parlia-
ment to amend the Broadcasting Act by
setting up Government control over all
radio programmes, the name of the spon-
sor is Senator Cameron, the Postmaster-
General. Nothing in the bill refutes
a feeling that it could have been picked
up in the shambles of Berlin where
Goebbels and Hitler took poison.
The bill is nothing less than a blatant
attempt to seize or control the choice,
arrangement and delivery of all radio pro-
grammes whatsoever by a gang com-
mitted to the establishment of one-party
rule of the Commonwealth in perpetuity,
and proposing by this legislation to silence
all criticism of that plan. If the Aus-
tralian people, quite apart from their
sentiments as radio-listeners, tolerate this
bid to turn even their leisure-time enter-
tainment into Socialist propaganda, they
will have held out their hands for the
chains of the serf. The bill follows the
lines of Hitler’s own scheme for exalting
the Nazi party in Germany by extinguish-
ing all freedom of thought, speech and
public debate. It makes political criticism
of the party in power a crime punishable
by elimination of the critic. Goebbels
had the same idea.
Only a deformed mentality could have
conceived it. Only a political gang
fearing itself to be doomed as soon as
the judgment of a free people can be
expressed at the ballot-box could
approve so desperate a device to save
itself from being thrown out of office.
Nothing more was wanted to show
how convinced is this Chifley Ministry
of the defeat awaiting it —and the Gee-
long by-election in Victoria has written
Chifley’s fate on the wall —or what dis-
tortion of democratic processes, what
suppression of free speech, it is willing
to inflict in an attempt to avert a just and
due fate. The Socialists are staking
everything on retaining power at the next
election. If they can contrive that, they
hope to fasten an absolute single-party
dictatorship on this country. The com-
pletion of their socialisation programme
depends on it. By hook or by crook—•
especially by crook—they are out, there-
fore, to bulldoze for its eventual en-
slavement an electorate traditionally slow
to wrath. This Broadcasting Bill pro-
claims their objective in every line.
Freedom of speech and of opinion is to
be destroyed.
And with their tongues in their cheeks
Mr. Chifley and his Ministers take credit
to the whole Government for the “efforts”
of Dr. Evatt abroad to secure for a - world
sick of Fascism in all its forms freedom
of thought and freedom of expression.
The Chifley Government demands that
not only should guarantees of thdse
“human rights” be written into the peace
settlements with our late enemies, but
that special courts should be established
at which redress against denial of them
can be sought. That is for show abroad.
At home in Australia these hypocrites in
high places believe in nothing of the sort.
The incident of the “Manila Girls” has
already exposed their complete indiffer-
ence to any human rights. The Broad-
casting Bill now confirms it. This is what
the Chifley Government intends to do,
denying to Parliament during what pur-
ports to be a deliberative debate any right
to amend the thing:
To create a Control Board of three mem-
bers to take complete control of all radio
stations’ equipment, programmes and
speakers.
All three members will be appointed by
the Government, which will name one of
them as chairman.
The chairman and one other member
shall be a quorum, and the chairman will
have, if necessary, two votes.
That is to say, if, despite every care to
choose as members faithful agents of
this totalitarian Ministry, one of the
members should reveal unexpected in-
dependence of mind, he can be sent on
a holiday and the chairman can then de-
cide all that the Board does. The Board
may delegate to any person anywhere any
of its powers and functions, even those of
the chairman.
This is what the control board is estab-
lished to do, after the best Goebbels ex-
ample :
Lay down what programme services each
radio station shall give, and when, as
approved by the Minister.
Condemn, if so desired, any technical
equipment or method of operation in any
commercial station.
Declare whether any programme is in
“the best interests of the general public.”
Declare what is political or controversial
matter, and acquire “equitable facilities”
for broadcasting of such matter.
Anything whatever it thinks fit, and it»
orders shall have the force of law.
Further, subject to any directions of the
Minister (the slipshod drafting language
no doubt means by the Minister), the
Board can fix the situation and power of
any radio station, the conditions on which
a commercial station may broadcast any
programme, and subsidise any commer-
cial station if the Minister thinks it a
deserving object of subsidy. What a
grand time any station on the Govern-
ment side is going to have!
Even after all this, the Socialists of
Canberra deem it necessary to provide
that only those competent in the opinion
of the Board shall be allowed to operate
any broadcasting equipment.
In case there are unforeseen weaknesses
anywhere in the foregoing, and so that
one particular political critic of the
Government may be tabbed for what
Goebbels used to call “liquidation,” there
is clause 22 banning the broadcasting of
“any dramatisation of any political
matter which is then current or was cur-
rent at any time during the last five pre-
ceding years.” The one amendment of
the bill in the Senate —brought down by
P.M.G. Cameron himself, and hailed with
delight by Information Minister Calwell
—is to this same clause, and provides, by
addition, that the A.B.C. (whose always-
nebulous independence is now ended for
certain) may determine to what extent
and in what manner political or contro-
versial matter may be broadcast at all.
Apart from the legal snags such as
construction of the phrase “the best in-
terests of the general public,” or the word
“dramatisation” in radio delivery—which
would cover every inflection of a voice
—the general contempt for all political
fair play, the creation of a body which
will make laws by decree under direction
from the Minister, and the obvious in-
tention to prohibit any live political
subject from radio debate even during
an election, make this bill the most
monstrous assault on free speech with
which the people of this country has
ever been threatened. During the Senate
debate Government spokesmen gave up
even pretending to disguise their object
Which Minister is finally to be chosen
to fill the role of Goebbels is not yet sure.
He may even, according to Postmaster-
General Cameron, be one, to be ap-
pointed, who will give his whole time to
this propaganda portfolio. That will
make the Goebbels parallel complete.
This Gambling Madness.
When the Communist party began to
infest this country its leaders seemed a
straitlaced lot. Certainly feeding the
. gambling fever in emulation of “Labor”
was no part of their programme. They
knew that Lenin and Trotsky, then the
twin gods of their idolatry, had never
backed a horse or a dog in their lives, and
would have taken a dim view of a Com-
munist organisation which encouraged the
pursuit of private wealth in the craziest
and deadliest way short of crime, even as
a method of speeding up the “socialisa-
tion,” by seizure, of “production, distri-
bution and exchange” and the apparatus
of government. So, in appearance at
least, they had to be consistent.
This consistency is a thing of the past.
The change arrived when Stalin became
the one Red god, with cynical empiricism
as the policy, dictated to his agents in
inferior countries. It occurred to the
gang at Marx House, Sydney, that en-
couragement of gambling would not only
give Communism an appeal to vast multi-
tudes of simpletons previously inaccessible,
but it would help to fan the discontent on
which it trades. So having, as always,
plenty of funds, whatever the source, the
gang bought a “sporting” sheet called the
“Newsletter.” In this publication, which
is now issued from the same printery as
the official “Tribune,” the lottery habit is
lauded and punting presented as the
noblest pastime of man, especially by a
writer who calls himself “The Mug
Punter” and seasons his stuff with smut —
another new Communist touch.
What with the immense volume of bet-
ting and the almost unbroken successes
of outsiders in “important events,” the
spring frenzy was, for bookmakers, the
most- bountiful on record. This has been
admitted by some of the newspapers
which, along with radio stations (to the
disgrace of both), make racing their prin-
cipal topic. But not by “The Mug
Punter.” After the Melbourne Cup race
had gone to a 100-to-l chance (even the
bookmakers offered 66 to 1) that Com-
munist hero had the face to assert that
“all my s.p. friends are moaning [all law-
breakers] .... couldn’t lay the favorite
.... one held £l2O and lost £100.” He fol-
lowed with specimens of the new Com-
munist “wit” (e.g., “Big Time Tess says
a girl that tries to talk her boy-friend
into buying her a dress should not buck
if he tries to talk her out of it”) and with
an affecting personal tragedy, mitigated
at the.last moment:
Kick off with the first fhree winners at
Canterbury (in my Shilling Newsletter tips)
and don’t back one of them Am down
£6. John Allan Shaw bets me eight thirty
bobs Merry John in the last. When Ray
Selkrig kicks him home I’m £6 in front.
You wouldn’t get it for an afternoon’s
work with a pneumatic drill.
Truly a fetching illustration of the
“Australian” Communist attitude to work,
though, if published in the Workers’
Paradise, it would secure for the scribe
and his editor bullets in the back of the
neck. And if the moral fails in the
case of chaps who toy with pneumatic
drills, it remains at the service of coal-
miners, wharflaborers, . trammies and
building tradesmen. In all their unions,
and others under Communist control or
influence, there are hosts of punters who
—to the injury of their own people, to
say nothing of the never-considered
country—increasingly behave in the tradi-
tional manner of “sports” who have lost
their “tin.”
Another incident of the spring frenzy
was the appearance of .Mr. John Wren
in the role of Sir Galahad, championing
a stable concerned in a horse-pulling
charge. It was stated in a confiding press
that the animal must have been “trying”
since John, having got “the oil,” had
risked £5 on it; and £5 was a big wager
for St. John. This “big wager”
must have drawn shouts of laughter
from old hands who remember
the coups Mr. Wren brought off
with Murmur and The Rover when he
emerged from the comparative, though
not unwelcome, obscurity of his Col-
lingwood tote. Nowadays, of course, he
has no need to go punting, except as a
mild diversion. Over the years he has
derived a mammoth income from his in-
vestments in racecourses, in Victoria,
Westralia and Queensland. It looks as
if the so-called Brisbane Amateur Turf
Club will be paying the Wren estate
tribute till the crack of doom.
Yet another item on the record of
an unforgettable spring was a Sydney
District Court case in which it was
asserted in cross-examination that a
“leviathan” bookmaker named Mulligan
had won £12,000 on a horse called Pic-
colo at Randwick. Mr. Mulligan ad-
mitted having recommended the trainer
(Chaffe) and the rider (Simpson) to the
owner (Stevens) and had Piccolo “going
for” him in his “book,” but denied the
promise of £2OOO to Stevens and almost
every other article of the impeachment.
Among other things, he denied owning
a steed called Flying Duke “in partner-
ship with Ashley”—the. Commonwealth
Minister of Supply and leader of the
Senate—though he said “I often take
Senator Ashley to Chaffe’s stables —he is
interested in horses.” Mulligan was not
asked whether the leader of the Senate
had been seen on racecourses behind the
Mulligan stand, as if he had a friendly
interest in the Mulligan operations.
Chaffe, for his part, according to the
“Truth” report, “told Judge Holt that
training fees were not being charged for
any of Senator Ashley’s horses.” His
Honor was not impressed by the “memory
or veracity” of the three principal wit-
nesses.
Senator Ashley Is No. 2 or No. 3 in
order of precedence in the N.S.W.
“Labor” party. When Mr. McKell, now
Gee-Gee, was Premier that party made
history of a sort by introducing legisla-
tion for the setting up of a racing “club”
what time Australia was exposed to the
danger of conquest by Asiatics—the only
white man’s country so exposed since
the siege of Vienna by the Turks in the
seventeenth century. One clause of that
measure is also unique in a dingy way;
Sub-section 2 of section 9: The Treasurer
may advance such moneys. to the club as
the Governor may approve upon such terms
and conditions as to repayment and interest.
This was part of “Act No. 22, 1943.”
In effect, when the enemy had bombed
Australian towns, was trying to annihilate
a captured Australian division by sheer
savagery, and was still on Australian
territory, public funds in the leading
State were to be placed at the disposal
of a glorified gambling hell.
The N.S.W. Opposition should chal-
lenge “Labor” on its subservience to the
Booze and Betting interests. Always
partial to the Booze interest, “Labor”
has ministered to it by making it legal
for licences to be transferred from over-
pubbed slum neighborhoods to publess
residential districts like Cremome, Cam-
meray and Balgowlah, irrespective of the
wishes of the residents. And, when a
coal shortage is certain, the setting-up
of the glorified gambling hell is to be
followed by the establishment of night
“trots” with betting and, apparently, with
mid-week horseracing to be sanctioned
by way of “amendment.”
The craze for gambling is already hav-
ing palpable effects on manners and be-
havior, in the industrial as well as the
social field. Unbridled, as “Labor”
would have it, in wicked betrayal of
“Labor’s” own professions and people, it
threatens the very future of the country,
a country which is no longer secure as it
was when the Empire was supreme and
unchallenged.
Thunder in the North.
“Ek Dum” sums it up:
China, to all intents and purposes, is now
completely at the mercy of the Communists
and of Soviet Russia, the directing force be-
hind them.
The Communist infiltration long ago pene-
trated effectively to the far south of Chiang
Kai-shek’s realm. It holds sway over a large
area on the Indo-China border and of the
greater part of Hainan Island. It has its
cells in the Chinese cities under Chiang’s nose.
It seems that it even has nuclei in his Govern-
ment, for one or two of its members are preach-
ing a policy very much like the Communist
line.
The position of the Chiang regime is not
merely desperate. It seems to be settled. With
the fall of Mukden the fate of the Manchurian
area was decided for the time being. All other
areas held by the Chinese Government are little
better than islands in a Communist sea.
For months Nanking, Chiang’s capital, has
been in a hopeless position. Its population has
been starving, its streets unsafe. Its electricity
supply virtually ceased to exist some weeks ago.
Water, a month ago, was “on” for only an
hour or two a day. The Administration reeks'
with corruption and impropriety. There, as in
other cities, savage bands of human wolves,
constituted by hunger, are being kept down
by the most ruthless martial-law methods.
Chiang himself seems to have disappeared oti
the face of the earth, and his regime for all
practical purposes is at an end, unless he makes
a compact with his conquerors.
The fate of Korea is just as well settled, for
the time being, as that of China, The United
States forces there have been whittled down
to a minimum, and there is every sign that they
may be withdrawn altogether and southern
Korea left to the protection of the benign-look-
ing Singham Rhee, first President of the feeble
new republic which constitutes the southern
of Korea, and his equally benign Premier,
Mr. Lee Bum Suk. Left to themselves they
have no defence against the heavily-armed
northern Korean republic, which is virtually part
of Soviet Russia and equipped by that brutal
and ambitious country. Even with American
background help it was possible to put down
the rebellion which flared up near the shores of
Tshushima Strait last month only after two
towns had been destroyed and hundreds of
lives lost. And this rebellion was not merely
a Communist manifestation; it apparently had
behind it an element which resents the division
of Korea into two parts, and—quite rightly—
blames past American weakness for having per-
mitted it.
With Korea in Russian hands and China in
the Communist grasp, Moscow will own an
Empire which ranges from the Elbe to the Sea
of Japan; from within 300 miles of the English
coast to within 250 miles of the 8.C.0.F. base
in Japan, which at present is thickly infested
with Korean Communist agitators and with re-
turned prisoners-of-war who have been “in-
doctrinated” with Communism in Russian
prison camps.
The areas of Japan which were devoted to
war industry are fruitful fields for the propa-.
gation of Communist doctrines, since the pro-
hibitions which have been imposed as safeguards
have thrown tens of thousands out of work or
condemned them to what they consider menial
occupations outside their natural sphere.
The Australian policy in this area has helped
the growth of Communism. It is the policy
forcibly supported by the Australian Communist
unions and, therefore, of course, by the sen-
sational daily press and by Dr. Evatt. Its
ingredients are the concept that democracy can
only come to Japan through the establishment
of trade-unionism on the Australian— i.e., the
Communist —model, which the Communists de-
sire as a vehicle of organisation and sabotage.
Luckily the Americans appreciate the dangers
of the trade-union situation. General Mac-
Arthur, in direct contravention of Australian,
Russian and British Socialist Governments’
policy, has within the past month refused to
allow the Japanese Government to yield to
blackmailing wage demands of the Communist-
run civil-service unions in Tokyo, has deprived
those unions of the right of collective bargaining
and made it clear through his spokesman that
he will not tolerate a position in which unionism
constitutes a second Government of the country
like that which is at present running Australia
with the feeble Chifley Cabinet as its instru-
ment.
All this points the danger which looms in
the “Far East.” It is inevitable in the case of
war between Russia and the Western Powers
(which outside Australia and especially in Japan
and China many well-informed people fear to
be not only inevitable but imminent) that Korea
would have to be abandoned; just as evident
as that Western Germany would be indefensible
back to the Rhine —a fact which is being tacitly
acknowledged at the moment by the British and
Americans, who are in process of handing back
the Ruhr areas to Germany. This is one of the
most ominous portents of the year.
It is equally evident that with China in its
hands and with Korean bases only 120 miles
from Japan in the south and far less in the
north, the Soviet Union would not be likely
to allow the last-named country, with all its
reservoir of skilled labor and other potentials,
to remain out of its sphere without a struggle,
in case of hostilities with the West. It must
become the instant endeavor of the Russians
in case of war to secure Japanese resources and
apply them to its aggressive purposes. The same
applies to the resources of Malaya, tin and
rubber, invaluable for war, and to those of
India and Pakistan.
War or no war against the West, the Iron
Curtain is coming down over China, and a
policy which has for its objfective the driving
of the white man out of Asia and all its
fringes—out of Japan, Hong Kong, Shanghai,
Malaya, Indonesia —is already in being and
operating.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Victoria Shows the Way.
Recently the Communist organ in Syd-
ney announced that French “workers
had discovered a new industrial weapon,
the “rolling strike,” whereby various sec-
tions of industry were in turn thrown
idle for short periods, thus dislocating
the whole field of industry. There is
nothing new in the technique ; the Com-
rades here have been practising it for
years.
Last March Queensland was the
battlefront when Moscow-minded unions
turned on a transport strike and in typi-
cal class-war jargon spoke of “blockad-
ing” the northern State until their de-
mands were met. Action by the Han-
lon Government and the A.W.U., un-
assisted by Canberra or the McGirrs, put
an end to that business, although the
Queensland Government threw away
some of the fruits of its victory by back-
ing down when the trouble was over.
The scene of the next demonstration of
Communist arrogance and disregard for
the welfare of the people, including the
“workers,” was N. S. Wales, where an
inter-union squabble (Com. spite against
the A.W.U. very evident) was made the
occasion for a general coal strike. Pub-
lic indignation, more than the unwonted
threats of action by Chifley and Bad-
deley which that indignation evoked,
showed the Communists that they had
bitten off more than they could chew,
and the strike collapsed. With it col-
lapsed the temporary fierceness ,of
Federal and N. S. Wales “Labor”
leaders.
Now the “war” has moved further
south, to Melbourne, the scene of a
previous attempt by Communist-con-
trolled unions to hold the community up
to ransom. On November T 3 a lightning
strike of gas employees renewed the
threat to Victorian industry which had
just been averted by the failure of the
coalfields hold-up. The trouble was
settled within a day, though its effects
lasted well beyond the week-end, but
the Victorian Government decided to
govern, and announced that it intended
to proclaim the Essential Services Act,
passed earlier this year at the time of the
Victorian transport strike and since kept
in cold-storage. Acting-Premier Mc-
Donald had been criticised for not in-
voking the Act during the bread strike,
which had just dragged to an ignominious
conclusion when the gas was turned off.
Obviously the, gas strike was the last
straw.
The Essential Services Act prohibits
strikes in essential services unless
approved by secret ballot by a majority
of persons concerned. It prohibits
picketing, and provides for penalties up
to £lOOO for breaches by union officials,
£5O for offences by individual members.
Despite howls and threats from the
A.R.U. and other Communist-dominated
unions, the Government proclaimed the
Act, and the Red unions, against the ad-
vice of the Tra4es Hall Council, called
on their members to cease work for 24
hours in protest. Trams and trains
stopped running, shipping in the port of
Melbourne lay idle and building work
ceased; at Wonthaggi coalminers stayed
on the surface. Although the T.H.C.
opposed the strike, it passed a resolution
condemning the action of the Govern-
ment, calling upon the Federal Govern-
ment to intervene (just how, it did not
state), and instructing member unions
not to take part in secret ballots under
the Act “when that ballot results from
action in accord with T.H.C. policy.”
An all-important feature of the Vic-
torian brawl, absent from the trials of
strength in Queensland and N. S. Wales,
is that the Hollway-McDonald Govern-
ment was put into power only twelve
months ago by an anti-“ Labor” swing
which, while influenced to a large extent
by the Federal Bank Grab, was also a
protest against the Cain Government’s
failure to use a firm hand with the trans-
port-union bosses. Almost as soon as
Hollway assumed office the Reds tried
the same game, and the Premier, claim-
ing that the people’s verdict had given
him a mandate to use effective measures,
brought in the Essential Services Act,
which sent the Comrades running for
shelter. Since then they have been
squealing that the Act is aimed not
merely at them, but is “an attempt
to smash the whole trade-union move-
ment.” Ten days ago when Acting-
Premier McDonald had the gas strike on
his hands he was given an indication that
the people generally have not swallowed
this Communist guff; the early returns
for the Geelong by-election correctly
showed that the swing against “Labor”
was still on and the knowledge un-
doubtedly strengthened McDonald’s hand
when he was pondering whether or not
to proclaim the Act.
When this page went to the printer on
Monday the Red bosses, without consult-
ing their members, were threatening
“nationwide action” if the strike-leaders
were prosecuted, and the Victorian
Cabinet, under the leadership of Mr.
Hollway, an hour or so back from abroad,
had before it the Crown Solicitor’s
opinion on whether it had a strong
enough case to prosecute under the Act
or whether further legislation was neces-
sary. There seemed little doubt that the
Government would use whatever powers
it possessed.
The reception given to the latest Com-
munist challenge to law and order sug-
gests that the rank and file of Victorian
workers are fed-up with Moscow mili-
tancy, and there are signs that the feeling
is not confined to Victoria. It is perhaps
too much to hope that “Labor” Govern-
ments in Canberra and Sydney will take
courage from the example of what a
resolute Government can do ; but, any-
way, the example is there.
Mr. McGirr Unearthed.
Somewhere about the middle of last
week it dawned on some Sydney news-
paper editor or other that, although all
of the other travelling Premiers had been
heard, from, a dead silence prevailed in
the vicinity of Mr. McGirr, the one from
N.S.W. It then developed that even the
vicinity couldn’t be located, and some-
what peevish speculations appeared as to
the gentleman’s whereabcfuts.
He was, said one item, expected in
New York on such and such a date at
such and such a time ; but, when the head
serang or some lesser evil attached to
HE ASKED FOR IT.
the Australian Department of Informa-
tion there went to meet a train which
was expected to disgorge Mr. McGirr,
there was no Mr. McGirr; nor had any-
body, from the loco.-driver to the negro
porter, heard of him.
A couple of days passed in which odd
speculations as to the whereabouts of
this modern Pimpernel appeared; and
just when it seemed Mr. Baddeley or Mr.
O’Sullivan would have to be sent forth
to run him down a voice came out of
disturbed Europe announcing that Mr.
McGirr had been discovered “investigat-
ing housing schemes,” and America knew
him not. It was at first assumed, with
some justification, that he was looking
for a spare cottage or two to make up
the awful deficit between his 1947 pro-
mise of “90,000 homes for the people
of N.S.W. in three years” and the hand-
ful of houses, shacks and converted Army
huts they’ll really get. How little they
of N.S.W. know their Premier! What
he was discovering was that “nowhere in
the world is there a better housing-scheme
than the one in N.S.W.” Whereupon a
morning-paper nark insinuated that it
was unnecessary for Mr. McGirr to have
gone to all that trouble and expense, since
his own Housing Minister would have
said so himself on being given the slightest
encouragement.
Hardly had the N. S. Welsh had time
to savor that when the Pimpernel was
located again, this time spending £250,000
of their money buying “excavators for
State public works.” It was further dis-
covered that “difficulty in obtaining de-
livery of this equipment has been hold-
ing up expansion schemes involving mil-
lions of pounds.” Somewhat puzzled by
all this, the innocent citizens have since
been casting their minds about the State,
seeking from Tenterfield to the Murray,
from the coast to Broken Hill, these
“expansion schemes.” Since about all
they could identify was one single scheme
for the expansion of trotting and dog-
racing, with betting, there is now a con-
viction that the message concerning hous-
ing was correct after all. Obviously the
excavators have a purpose, and obviously
that purpose is to dig caves in which the
homeless can take shelter under the wing
of a benevolent “Government,” what time
they prepare to “invest” the saving in
rent on one or other of the Government-
sponsored trotting, dog-racing or gal-
loping tracks.
The caves, of course, will be dug by
day-labor working a 40-hour week, with
ample tea breaks morning and afternoon,
waiting-time, appearance money, discom-
fort rates and an added margin calcu-
lated on the basis of the difference be-
tween 5-to-2 and the tote odds for the
Flying.
Why Prices Are Rising.
The prices referendum was not to decide
whether or not the Canberra Govern-
ment should at once abandon price-
control (as it did), but whether it should
retain the right to control prices for ever.
Most of those who voted against that
Government wanted prices-control to
continue where necessary and until post-
war conditions adjusted themselves. All
they opposed, and rightly, was the notion
that the central Government should have
permanent power over prices.
Since the referendum prices have in-
creased, and Federal “Labor” and its
Communist offsiders of course blame the
“No” vote; the inference being that a
“Yes” vote would have meant prices re-
maining at their old levels while wages
increased and hours became shorter, the
worker thus to have a pocketful of cash
and plenty upon which to spend it. But,
in the light of later statistical evidence, a
“Yes” vote would not have stopped the
rise. High wages and shorter hours mean
mounting costs of production, and that’s
all there is to it.
The Commonwealth Statistician’s
figures to the end of September show
that prices were spiralling under the
Chifley Government, that the upward
movement was irresistible before the
referendum and that the “No” vote, by
giving Mr. Chifley the chance to shift the
responsibility at once to the States, was
something of a godsend to Federal
“Labor.” It was able to pass the buck to
the States. And it made the States’ task
harder by lifting subsidies.
Adelaide “Advertiser’s” able Canberra
representative points out that up to the
advent of “Labor” in October, 1941, the
Menzies Government had kept prices well
under control. The index showed a rise
of only 10.2 p.c. above the pre-war level.
The Curtin Government, with the Jap
war on its hands, managed fairly well,
so that when war ended in 1945 the
figure was only 22.1 p.c. above the pre-
war level. But by referendum-day
(29/5/’4B) the increase was 43.1 p.c.
It would have been a lot more only
that property-owners had to help keep it
down by being stopped from raising rents,
though the cost o£ owning rentable
property mounted in proportion to other
costs. Further, the taxpayers were forced
to help keep prices down by paying heavy
subsidies on certain goods. Considering
these and other factors, the “Advertiser”
man quite reasonably concludes that by
May last the real price increase was be-
tween 55 and 60 p.c. above pre-war level.
The States find it impossible to keep
prices down for the same reasons that
would have stopped the Commonwealth
from doing it. The post-war shortage of
consumer goods, the rise in overseas
prices which could only be countered to
some extent by subsidies (and since sub-
sidies come ffrom taxes they are merely
increased prices in another form), a
world food famine —all these were power-
ful enough factors in themselves. When
to them was added the rush of Australian
“Labor” Governments to introduce the
40-hour week, to increase' wages, pen-
sions and “social services,” and to bur-
den industry with all sorts of costs, rising
prices were plainly mevitable.
Vanishing Queenslanders.
Although its case is not so bad as that
of the southern States, Queensland has
an ageing population and a continued
drift from the land. It is the most de-
centralised State and has nearly as many
important ports as all the other States put
together, yet its total population is not as
big as that of either Sydney or Mel-
bourne. This would have little signifi-
cance in a country whose overall popu-
lation was rapidly increasing, but in Aus-
tralia, where the population is not doing
that and where Queensland is the frontier
of a comparatively isolated white country
on the fringe of millions of colored
people, stirred from their long sleep by a
great war, it holds a future menace that
can’t be disregarded.
On the night of June 30, 1947, when
the Commgnwealth census was taken,
1,106,415 people, excluding full-blood
aboriginals, slept in Queensland, though
1887 of them were non-residents. In
Brisbane and the provincial cities and
towns generally there are more females
than males, though the outback and
small-town figures bring the males to
567,471 and females to 538,944. This
se6ms to argue that if some northern girls
are to marry they’d better head for the
outback. Thgy’ll be needed there. The
census showed that Queensland’s popula-
tion-increase since 1933 was 16.77 p. 0.,
compared with the general Australian in-
crease of 14.33 p.c., but in “the rural
division” there was an actual loss of 1109
people since 1933.
The real problem, however, is the
ageing population. Comparative figures
for the inter-census periods, 1921-33 and
1933-47, of the contribution of each age-
group to the increased population re-
veal a startling position:
1921-33.
Age-group: Number.
Under 21 48,660
21 to 49 92,310
50 and over 49,616
1933-47.
Under 21 22,503
21 to 49 '56,001
50 and over 76,489
This can only mean that Queenslanders
who were 50 in 1933 mostly kept on
getting older or had their numbers in-
creased by immigrants from the under-50
group and elsewhere, but babies stopped
getting born, and the supply of children
to replace their elders’ passing into the
aged ranks has almost dried up. Since
this is by no means confined to Queens-
land, it ought to be a problem of first im-
portance to the people and their Gov-
ernments. All the vast Governmental
and semi-Governmental plans afoot for
the development and defence of Aus-
tralia, socialist or otherwise, aren’t worth
the paper they’re written on if the race is
to persist in dying out.
The one bright spot in the Queensland
figures is that 89.7 p.c. of Queenslanders
are native-born Australians and 99.6 p.c.
are of British nationality. How long that
brightness will stay depends on how soon
the terrible drop in young stock is arrested.
The Fulbright Act.
It hasn’t received the attention it de-
serves in this country, though New Zea-
land has wasted no time, and a lot of
other places will be getting in on the
ground floor. Briefly, it is a United States
Act under which America will use money
from the sale of U.S. surplus war
materials abroad to finance exchange of
stddents, professors and technicians be-
tween America and other countries.
Talking to the English-speaking Union
in Melbourne about it, U.S. Ambassador
Co wen said the America-New Zealand
agreement provided for an annual ex-
penditure of £36,000. The money pays
the fares both ways of Maorilanders who
can find means to maintain themselves for
courses of study in the U.S.A. Mr.
Cowen hopes a similar agreement will
soon be working with Australia, and,
when it is, predicts an influx of Ameri-
can students and teachers.
To the thoughtful young Australian, as
well as to his professor, there must be
something attractive about America,
which has somehow managed to main-
tain its leading position in the world
without herds of official planners and
without a Government which believes the
profit motive should be stifled and private
enterprise hamstrung. American Gov-
ernments, State or Federal, don’t run
trains or trams or airlines; they seem
to think people can build houses without
endless bureaucratic and Ministerial con-
trol ; nor do they want to take over
coalmines and banks and steelworks. And
Americans somehow go on being happy
and progressive and able to stagger the
world with production figures.
Decidedly a country worth seeing by
people eager to learn. The Fulbright
Act seems to offer opportunities for
observation and, what’s more, a chance
for the two peoples to obtain a better
knowledge of each other.

CARRERAS LIMITED -OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY I
POLITLCAL POINTS
That the Irish bull is no invention of
the fiction-writer is shown by the attitude
of Eire’s leaders on the question of sever-
ing the final tie with the British Common-
wealth —they, want to get out of it, but
bejabers they still want to be in. No one
disputes the right of Southern Ireland to
leave the Commonwealth. As far as
obligations are concerned she left it, as a
political unit, years ago, as was obvious
during the years 1939-45 ; what concerns
her leaders now is that although the
formal link they desire to break entails no
obligations it still carries some privileges,
chief of which is Imperial preference.
Eire’s External Affairs Minister, Sean
Mcßride, has been discussing with British
and Dominion representatives a preposi-
tion that when his country leaves the
Empire she should still enjoy the same
trade preferences and privileges she does
now. Dr. Evatt attended the talks, but
there has been no word from him or from
the P.M. concerning Australia’s attitude
on the subject. A clear statement is
, needed. Australia and the other Com-
' monwealth countries should t?ll Eire that
if she leaves the Empire she leaves with
our blessing, but that preferences must be
considered entirely as a matter of busi-
ness.
The Federal Government and the N. S.
Wales Transport Minister are working on
a scheme for inaugurating a joint air
service in N. S. Wales. Apparently the
idea is based on the algebraic principle
that minus times minus equals plus; by
wedding the Commonwealth airways
deficit to the State transport ditto the
Socialist wizards expect to get a surplus.
Victorian “Labor,” smarting under the
loss of the Geelong seat, will approach
the Prahran by-election, occasioned by
the death of Mr. Quirk, with anything but
a light heart. Prahran was a “Labor”
stronghold once, but a Liberal held it
from 1932 until August, 1945, when
Quirk won it at a by-election. He con-
firmed his right to it at a general election
three months later when he polled 11,949
votes against 8977 cast for his Liberal
opponent and 1459 for an Independent
Labor man. When the earthquake hit the
Cain Government last year Prahran
tottered in the balance; Quirk had a
bare 91 votes to spare when the count
was over. The by-election will doubt-
less be fought on the issue of the Essen-
tial Services Act; the outcome will have
an interest far beyond the borders of
Prahran and Victoria.
Dr. Evatt has established a “shadow”
committee to speed up the work of
U.N.O. It must have been Bert the
poetical parson Edward Young had in
mind two and a half centuries ago when
he wrote:
Fond man! the vision of a moment made.
Dream of a dream, and shadow of a shade.
In a polite farewell message to his
hosts before leaving England—he is the
first of the political tourists to get back
home —S.A. Premier Playford remarked
that “An inspection of almost any one
of Britain’s large enterprises shows that
almost feverish energy is being applied to
rebuilding, reorganising and re-equipping
....No consideration of cost is being
spared to bring [vast new factories] into
production.” This was on the eve of the
British Socialist Government’s introduc-
tion of a bill to “nationalise” the steel
industry, on which all these things depend.
That should put a stop to this “almost
feverish energy.”
Villon and L’Huiller, French Com-
munist Ms.P., are to be charged with
“rebellion and organising an unauthorised
demonstration,” according to a Paris re-
port of disturbances when Communists
there tried to stage their own Armistice
Day ceremony. There was another Villon
of Paris, whom R. L. Stevenson de-
scribed as a “little dark rag of a man,”
and who thought nothing of sharing a
murdered friend’s purse or stealing farth-
ings from a dead street-walker what time
he wrote a roundelay or a couplet. He
lived too soon. In this day and age he
would have made an excellent Comrade
—provided he could lose his sense of
humor.
The Evatt-Lie “peace” proposals got
from the Western Powers the only reply
possible while any sanity remained with
the leaders of Britain, France and U.S.A.
The Doc. can hardly have expected any-
thing else, though it is not in the nature
of Australia’s supreme egdtist to be con-
tent with only one snub; he’ll go on to
invite more. Unfortunately for Aus-
tralia, its Federal Government, which has
no foreign policy other than the whims
of Evatt, has, through the P.M. and
Senator McKenna, given its support and
authority to the ill-conceived move. The
“New Statesman” said- of “Our Foreign
Policy”:
His intervention was ineffective not
merely because he had no new proposals
to make, but because the psychological
moment for conciliation is still far off
Evatt and Lie would be well advised to
concentrate on secondary problems which
give a real prospect of success.
Well-meant, but wasted, advice. Bert
couldn’t possibly interest himself in
secondary problems.
Dave Drummond (C.P.), that consistent
New-Stater in the N.S.W. Parliament,
got on to his favorite theme the other
day—the increasing size of Sydney. Hold-
ing that the 1947 census showed that
two-thirds of N.S.W. population was
concentrated in Sydney, he called it “the
finest bomb target in the world.” He
might have added, with truth, that it
was also a gamblers’ and racketeers’
target and that the two-thirds are hope-
lessly at the mercy of Commo union
bosses.
President Truman has appointed a
Republican, John Foster Dulles, as acting-
leader of the U.S, delegation to U.N.O.
American foreign policy is conducted on
a bipartisan basis. In contrast our
Federal “Labor” Government treats any
Opposition interest in external affairs as
an impertinence. Last week, for the
umpteenth time, the P.M. refused to grant
time for a debate on external affairs. The
refusal is understandable; “Labor’s”
foreign policy is “leave it to Bert,” and
no one can ever be sure what Bert is
going to do next.
Formality in international affairs is all
very well, but Sydney “Sun” overdid it a
little last Saturday when it referred to
Katz-Suchy, Polish delegate to U.N.0., as
Mr. Katzhyphensuchy,
Last week the Opposition asked Mr.
Chifley for an assurance that there would
be no attempt to postpone unduly the
Federal elections, due next year. The
Constitution provides that the House of
Representatives “shall continue for three
years from the first meeting of the House,
and no longer, but may be sooner dis-
solved by the Governor-General.” The
present Parliament met for the first time
on November 1, 1946, which gives it an-
other 11 months talking-time, but there
have been suggestions in the Press, not-
ably the Bathurst “Advocate,” that the
Government plans an election “early in
1950.” When the question was fired at
him the P.M. refused to give any assur-
ance. v
New Zealand makes Australia look
cheap on food exports to Britain.
In 1938 Australian shipments were
worth £46 million, those of N.Z. £36
million. In 1947 the relative figures were
£45 million and £64 million. Mr. Frith,
the C.P. member for Lismore, gave the
Sydney Parliament the figures, and he
should know. He seemed to think it was
because the Sydney Government wasn’t
assisting the producers, but that isn’t the
only reason by a long chalk.
Possibly taking a leaf out of the books
of Messrs. Chifley, Dedman, Ward and
Calwell, Miners’ Federation officials
claimed that reports of threats of bash-
ings allegedly made against A.W.U. men
working on the Kemeira tunnel were
newspaper lies. Lies or not, a mine-
worker was convicted in Wollongong last
week on a charge of having unlawfully
assaulted one of the Kemeira men. Pro-
ceeded against under the Crimes Act, he
was given a good-behavior bond of £2O
for 12 months; costs set him back £5.
Still, the Federation may be right; the
evidence said nothing about threats.
The Metal Trades Employers’ Associa-
tion has had to answer for an article in
the “Metal Trades Journal” criticising
the 40-hour-week judgment, and has been
fined £2OO for contempt by the Full
Bench of the Federal Arbitration Court
Meantime the effect of the 40-hour week
speaks for itself, regardless of Courts, em-
ployers’ or “workers’ ” associations.
Though one morning newspaper put
up the heading, “Growers to Get Wool
Deal Profit,” and a lot of sheepmen
began to think about buying new hats,
Pollard’s bill to “set up machinery” to
distribute war-time wool profits, “if
any,” to growers had the smell of a
catch about it* Grower organisations
have worked out the total of such profits
at around the • £2O million mark, but,
according to Pollard, “the final profit or
loss could not be determined while the
Governments are under an obligation to
buy in wool from current clips which
fail to realise the agreed reserve price.”
One of these days a Government will
arrive at . Canberra ready and willing to
honor its obligations without strings, but
it won’t be the same color as the present
push.
The Reuter man in Washington expects
another international wheat conference to
break out “early next year.” The last
one was signed by 36 nations and was to
“guarantee prices to producers and con-
sumers for five years.” But only 12
nations ratified it, and it fell in like a
N.S.W. wheat-stack when the mice get in.
The Reuter man seems to think Ameri-
can Republican hostility put,the weevils
into the last agreement and that Truman’s
election will put them out. Meantime the
new Australian- “stabilisation” scheme
guarantees 6s. 3d. a bushel to Australian
growers for the next five years, a price
likely to be well under any “international
guarantee.”
Aneurin Sevan’s remark that the Attlee
Government’s biggest headache had been
the shortage of steel must have come as
a surprise to those students of British
politics who had assumed that the Gov-
ernment’s biggest headache was Aneurin
Bevan.
Always eager to seize on any pretext
to keep themselves in the limelight and
to pose as defenders of the people’s in-
terests, the Sydney Commos have been
making a great to-do over the Govern-
ment decision to raise tram- and bus-
fares. Their methods involve “demon-
strations” and proposals to meet the
transport deficit by repudiating the debt
on the tramways system or handing it
over to consolidated revenue, at the same
time cutting down the trammies’ hours
and raising their wages, N.S.W. Trades
and Labor Council held a meeting a
couple of weeks ago and decided to send
a deputation to acting-Premier Baddeley
protesting against the increased fares.
This wasn’t spectacular enough for the
Moscow boys, so last Thursday 8.W.1.U.
delegate Clancy (a small trickle of the
overflow from Marx House) tried to get
the T.L.C. to agree to a two-hour stop-
page of work on December 1. When the
motion was defeated Clancy and his
comrades walked out of the Hall, mut-
tering dark threats.
Army Minister Chambers has refused to
confirm reports that the Defence Act is
to be amended to permit the C.M.F. to
be used for service abroad. If there is
anything in the rumor it will come as a
shock to those recruits who deduced from
Mr. Chambers’s advertisements that the
sole function of his Army was to teach
men a useful trade.
Two conflicting authorities:
“ trade, commerce and intercourse
among the States, whether by means of
internal carriage or ocean navigation, shall
be absolutely free.”—Sec. 92 of the Com-
monwealth Constitution.
“The Seamen’s Union will blockade Vic-
toria immediately if unionists are prosecuted
under the Act. That means no sea trans-
port in or out of Victoria, and, particularly, -
no coal. Without coal Victoria’s gas and
electricity would stop, and without gas or
electricity industry would come to a stand-
still.”—Comrade Elliott, secretary of the
Seamen’s Union.
While the Kemeira tunnel dispute
awaits the appointment of an arbitrator
the Miners’ Federation campaign to oust
the A.W.U. from the mining industry
continues at Captain’s Flat (N.S.W.) and
Leigh Creek (S.A.). Twice in the past
three years attempts have been made to
get the men of South Australia’s only
coalmine to switch over to the Red outfit.
The latest move, made last week, was the
establishment of a branch of the Federa-
tion on the field. The Comrades are try-
ing to make capital out of the difficulties
inseparable from the pioneer stages of a
new industry in an isolated locality, but
there has so far been no great rush to
swap horses in the middle of the desert,
and A.W.U. State president Cameron has
foretold that the attempt will be no more
successful than previous efforts.
The Queensland People’s party has pro-
posed to the Country party a complete
merger of the two organisations. Earlier
there were efforts to come to an arrange-
ment over the allocation of seats for the
next Federal election. Both sides agreed
to tackle eight seats each, and to run
joint candidates for the other two, but
the Q.P.P. backed down on the deal. The
amalgamation suggestion is a surprise
move and seems to have caught the
Country party off balance. Its chair-
man has pointed out that the constitution
of the party binds it to preserve its
entity and independence, but he is pre-
pared to submit any concrete proposal
to the central council next January. In
the meantime the Q.P.P. is calling for
candidates for 10 seats, including Fisher
and Herbert, the two in dispute. If the
two anti-“ Labor” parties can sink their
differences they should be able to win
Queensland; the 1946 Senate elections
showed that.
N. S. Wales Transport Minister O’Sul-
livan, replying to a Dorothy Dix concern-
ing press comment on tramway finances
conveniently asked in the Assembly by
one of his colleagues, said!
I saw the article in last Saturday’s
Sydney Morning “Herald,” and a number
of articles in virtually every other news-
paper published in the metropolitan area,
all of which compared Sydney trams with
Melbourne trams and asked why, when
Melbourne trams made a handsome profit,
our trams showed a loss.
The Minister then quoted an item from
the Melbourne “Argus” which mentioned
that “a deficit of £154,428 was incurred
by the Tramways Board in the 12 months
to June 30.” He commented: “The per-
sons who ought to know the state of the
Melbourne tramways finances are those
who control them.” This brought a reply
from Mr. Bell, chairman of the Mel-
bourne Tramways, to the effect that the
statements in the Sydney press were
accurate, that the tram profit for the year
was £28,496, and that the tram-and-bus
deficit quoted by Mr. O’Sullivan included
a payment of £137,000 to consolidated
revenue (the “Argus” report had pointed
this out). Mr. Bell added that in 30
years the Melbourne Tramways had
paid £3,192,000 to consolidated revenue,
distributed £250,000 to municipalities and
accumulated reserves of close on
£7,000,000. He concluded with “we have
been able to inform the public that for
the next three years to come, anyway,
there will be no increase in fares.” Mr.
O’Sullivan’s reply to that would have
done credit to Dean Maitland.


A JOINT EFFORT.
“The N. S. Wales Government, whose rail-transport industries, particularly the tramways, are incurring heavy losses, has agreed in principle to the joint operation of
intra-State airlines with the Commonwealth Government, the existing airlines of which are showing big operational deficits.”
“This is just a beginning; we’ll be running the double-deficit type in practically no time!”

”AND IT'S PRINTED

“Jasby”: The craze for bringing
ancient statutes up to date (B. 17 /11/ ’4B)
isn’t confined to England; the cables
recently announced that the Scottish
criminal code was also being revised. To
my disgust the hearty old punishment of
drawing and quartering is to be wiped
off the books. It’s a great shame ; those
little attentions to detail took all the
degradation out of hanging. There is a
tradition in iffy family that when my
ancestor, Angus Me Jasby, was sentenced
to death for his part in the McSporran
Rebellion his face was as long as a
fiddle when the Judge (a Maclean) told
him he was to be hanged, but lit up with
holy, radiance when the old boy added
“drawn and quartered.” I don’t know
whether the present mova is a result of
misplaced Socialist hunmfiitarianism or
merely a case of Sassenach infiltration,
but for Angus’s sake I’m glad they can’t
make it retrospective. Records say he
went to the scaffold with a smile on his
face, and when it was all over it was
difficult to say which quarter of him
looked the happiest.

the market these days, the news that
“modem Herculeses” from 10 countries
recently contested the title “Mr. Universe”
might have passed unnoticed in this
household had not a pictorial record of
the occasion found its way into the
house. Prizewinners were depicted in
various poses calculated to show their
outsize muscles to best advantage, and
my spouse showed our first-born the
physical giants. “That’s the sort of
muscles you’ll have if you eat all your
spinach,” she told him. “You’d like to
be big and strong like these men, wouldn’t
you?” Junior took in the 49in. chests,
then shook his head decisively. “No,” he
said. “They haven’t got any hair on their
chests.” I took a closer look. Not one
of the prizewinners had a feather to fly
tyith.
The Kyneton (Vic.) case
of the disputed baby recalls precautions
taken 'in medieval times to guard against
baby-switching. Strype’s Annals of the
Reformation mentions that midwives be-
fore practising had to take an oath: “Not
to suffer any other Bodys Child to be set
brought or laid before any Woman De-r
liyered of Child in the place of her
natural Child so far forth as I can know
and understand,” The oath proceeds:
“Also I will not use any kind of Sorcery
or Incantation in the time of Travail of
any Woman.” Perhaps the learned Jus-
tice should consider himself lucky that in
the Victorian case there is no suggestion
of any bone having been pointed.

“Clooter”: When Mrs. Clooter’s
November-lilies began to illuminate the
back fence and drench the early summer
nights with their heady fragrance, the
Clooter cat invited sundry friends in
to make nocturnal whoopee, whereupon
the neighbor’s sausage-hound invaded the
lily-bed at 90-odd miles an hour, and
violently dispersed the choir on its top
note. Mrs. Clooter shot from her bed
at slightly less speed, uttered a horrified
cry of “My lilies!” and, with old boots,
brooms, lawnmower and Clooter Jnr.’s
slate, assaulted the whole boiling. She
was furiously pursuing something when
the milkman entered the gate. He took
one look at the oncoming apparition,
back-leaped to the footpath and got be-
hind his milk-cart,’ only emerging when,
with an embarrassed explanation, the
floating draperies vanished into the house.
When daylight came the Clooter lilies
were discovered to have suffered but two
casualties, the Clooter cat had a minor
swelling over its starboard eye and was
“Who was the fool who talked about putting a camel through a
needle's-eye?"
promptly gathered up, crooned over,
petted and fed part of the breakfast-steak
and warm milk. It cost me Is. lOd. for
a new slate.
“Helldud”: Ever heard of John
Penny’s goldmine? John, an old lag, was
coachma'n to the N.S.W. Government
Architect in the long ago, and stabled his
coach and horse at the Immigration
Barracks near St. Mary’s Cathedral.
When old-age unfitted him for the job
friends at Court fixed it so that he drew
a laborer’s wage for sitting all day on a
chair in his old stable. Legend said he
was worth a mint when he passed out,
and that he had planted his hoard some-
where around his old stable. I had bor-
rowed my brother’s bike, and when cross-
ing George-street got into a tangle with
a bus-horse, I needed dough for repairs,
so, hiding on the premises until the rest of
the staff had departed, I decided to search
for the gold. From John’s old chair I
saw something gleam in the cobbled floor
and I gouged it out. A golden sovereign.
I had found old John’s plant. Feverishly
I went to work and every cobblestone was
carefully removed. When at 6 a.m. next
day they had been just as carefully re-
placed, the mine had yielded only that
single solitary quid. Still, it paid for the
bike repairs and saved me a tanning,

“Kimat”: Work has now been started
at Springbank (S.A.) on the new “Bedford
Industries” factory for the rehabilitation
of t.b. sufferers. Equipped with dUst-
extracting plant and new machinery, with
a modern layout adapted to meet medical
needs, the factory will carry on under
ideal conditions the good work at present
performed in the small temporary work-
shops at Glenelg which have built up an
inter-State market for such items as play-
pens, bath-mats and step-ladders. The
object is to give employment under
medical supervision to those who can
work only a few shours weekly, and to
others, able to work full time, but not able
to return to their former jobs. Apart from
the factory block and offices, the new
building will contain rest-room, canteen
and nurse-attendant’s room. The venture
has been financed by public subscription
and Government subsidy, on a site made
available by the South Australian Gov-
ernment.

“Melbn”: A new paint that ought to
interest homebuilders has been evolved
by C.S.I.R. Its base comes from beach-
sand deposits in N.S.W. and Queens-
land said to be extensive enough to last
for ever. The paint will withstand 1000
degrees of heat, and in a test made at
Yallourn (Vic.) where the main flue-stack
was painted, the coat was in excellent con-
dition after 32 weeks while ordinary
paints had vanished. The new paint is
non - inflammable, checks salt - water
erosion and stops corrosion in steel. How
to get the stuff off once it is put on is a
bit of *a problem, but perhaps it won’t
arise.

“C.Q.”: Wagner music played for the
first time at the birth of his son Siegfried
was chosen for a special service at St.
Paul’s Cathedral, Melbourne, to celebrate
the arrival of the Royal baby. Siegfried
was Cosima von Billow’s child by Wagner
and was born in 1869. The following
year Wagner married Cosima, who was
the daughter of Franz Liszt and the
Countess Marie d’Agoult. She was first
married to Wagner’s friend and champion
Hans von Biilow, the conductor, and left
him to share the fortunes of the rising
young composer. Siegfried studied com-
position, became a regular conductor at
Bayreuth, eventually succeeded his mother
as general supervisor of the famous
festivals of his father’s operas. He also
wrote operas himself, but none of them
came up to the creations of his father.

“A.A.M.C.”: A few vivid road-signs
might have a salutary effect on the road-
hog. I suggest something like the follow-
ing, which can be seen along more than
one American highway:
3084 people died of gas in this State
last year—33 inhaled it; 51 put a match to
it; and 3000 stepped on it!

“Herculaces”: “Zake” (B. 10/11/’4B)
looks back longingly to the metallic
laces. As a present-day schoolboy I am
more concerned about a revival of the
metal clips (attached to eyelets) under
which the lace could be slipped without
threading through the eyelet. My grandpa
showed me a pair of old boots on which
this snifter gadget was fitted to the six
or eight top eyelets. But why were they
only fixed to these particular eyelets?
And why aren’t they made now?

“Billy T.”: “Lao-dah’s” high-caste
Hindu (B. 10/11 /’4B) was more rigid in
his rulings than the village headman in
Narsinghgarh, where we were the guests
of a Scottish inspector-general of native
police. Out shooting, we had bagged a
chinkara and a few plovers, and, on his
recommendation, were on the lookout
for green pigeon. Our host was in deep
confab, with an assembly of elders,
backed by a throng of villagers,
youngsters, mongs and goats, when the
desired fowl were observed in the pipal-
tree above us. Then it started. Earnest
request by the Scot to the headman ; de-
bate among the elders; relaying of ver-
diet to Mac; reply by Mac. Further
discussion amongst the elders, much
pulling of beards, then nods of assent,
and the boss spoke to Kenheiwa Lai,
who took a shotgun and dropped the
birds. Interpretation? The pigeons were
in a pipal-tree, which is sacred to
Hindus; this was a particularly sacred
pipal-tree, because the slab of sandstone
beneath it had been sat upon by a holy
man returning from a penance. It was
a Hindu State ; the police boys were both
Hindu and Moslem and trained to tact-
ful behavior —all except Kenheiwa Lai,
who was of another raep. It was a vil-
lage-sized example of what Mountbatten
had to handle on a national scale.

“Sixenate”: A rumpus between two
women who were the attachments of one
man came before a suburban Court. Giv-
ing her evidence, the legal wife declared,
inter alia, that the original quarrel with
her husband had arisen because he in-
sisted upon having his breakfast served
in bed, and she had at last rebelled
against it. The magistrate remembered
this bit when the other woman, with
whom the husband had been living for
two years, was in the box, and asked,
“And do you give him his breakfast in
bed?” “Certainly not,” came the reply.
“I’m his de facto wife, not his wife,”

“Bo”: It is strange to recall that, of
the 14 operas which will be presented in
Sydney, six of the most popular—
“ Faust,” “Trovatore,” “Traviata,” “The
Barber,” “Butterfly” and “Carmen”—
were damned by the critics and, with the
exception of “Trovatore,” by the public
at their premieres. A few were utter
fiascos. Rossini was perhaps the un-
luckiest composer. During the first per-
formance of “The Barber” a cat walked
across the stage at a vital moment; then
one of the singers had to attempt to
staunch a nose-bleed in the middle of an
aria. The uproar this caused was capped
when the principal tenor turned his task
of tuning his guitar into a real bit of
unconscious slapstick. But none in the
present repertoire was so predestined to
initial failure as Debussy’s “Pelleas and
Melisande.” Now rarely performed out-
side France, the opera, which is based on
Maeterlinck’s dramatic poem, took
Debussy 10 years to write. The composer
had promised that the dramatist’s
common-law wife, Georgette Leblanc,
should sing the principal soprano role
at the premiere, Carre, manager of the
Opera-Comique, had insisted that the
young and then unknown American,
Mary Garden, should sing it. The deci-
sion aroused Maeterlinck to white-hot
fury, and in “Le Figaro” he wrote that
the performance would take place against,
his will, adding “I can only wish that its
failure may be resounding and prompt!”
He got his wish.
* * * •
“Click”: Agree with “Hypo” (B.
10/11/’4B) that British photo.-lenses beat
the German and still do ; but where their
makers slipped was in making lenses only
and leaving it to the customer to de-
mand that these be fitted to the stand- or
reflex-cameras desired, Fritz saw to it that
his best lenses were easily available in a
wide range of cameras. British manu-
facturers are now awake to this, .though
the prices of latest post-war models
are about double their pre-war equiva-
lent. My pick of all-round aero cameras
in the war was the British F 24. No cap-
tured German job came near it. With
the F 24 you could snap a Tiger Moth
on the ground eight yards away or pro-
duce mosaics for map-making from
20,000 ft., and it was the same camera
which supplied the pictures of Germany
—including Jena —on which the tactics of
Bomber Command were based. It was
later superseded by its offspring, the
F 52, flown in special Mosquitoes.

“C. 8.”: Prefabricated houses? One
of the first*was brought to Melbourne in
1852 by P. I. Burton, but Melbourne
wharves had no hydraulic cranes in those
days, so the edifice could not be unloaded
and had to return to England. Its owner
moved into a tent in Collins-street with
his wife and their three-year-old baby.
The babe became Mrs. Elizabeth Duncan,
who recently died at 96 at Frankston.

“Bacchus”: Our politicians are no
longer renowned for hard drinking—it’s
only the ones who can’t carry their
liquor who make the headlines —but
around about the dawn of Federation
things were different. One hard-headed
lawyer and legislator whose capacity to
absorb liquor without any apparent effect,
bodily or mental, was the envy of friends
and opponents alike "was more than once
the object of a plot to “drink him under
the table,” but it was always he who
showed little or nothing of the desired
effects when the libations were at their
height and the conspirators themselves
visibly incapable. His precaution, simple
and innocuous: a liqueur glass of olive
oil half an hour before the revels began,
ROADSIDE HOARDINGS.
“Roadside hoardings showing pretty girls smoking
cigarettes distracted the attention of motorists and
increased the risk of accidents.”
—President of Shires Association.
Take heed, you chaps who mar the gold-and-
greenery
Of wayside fields, you enterprising gents
Who furnish the industrial machinery
Fo • blatantly-announced advertisements
Whit a play the mischief with our rural scenery
And sorely outrage one’s aesthetic sense,
And now and then evoke a loud demand
For such unsightly objects to be banned.
’Twas bad enough when, yielding to th’ insistence
Of Nature’s spell among our vales and hills,
One was assaulted in the middle distance
By printed whooping that some brand of pills
Would mitigate the burden of existence.
And now one learns that even greater ills
These hoardings hold than anything implied
In the defacement of the countryside.
These posters representing bathing beauties
Toying with fags, gay nymphs in dishabille.
Damsels that Yanks would designate as “cuties,”
May be a magnet, keen observers feel,
To lure a motor-driver from his duties,
Distract him for a moment from the wheel.
It isn’t fair, our shires protectors say,
To put such eye-temptation 1 in his way.
Announcements specifying with precision
Merits of oils and wines and wares like these
Are quite unlikely to confuse the vision
Required for steering horseless carriages,
And cause thereby a danger of collision
With other cars or trucks or poles or trees.
But obviously it’s a different thing
When pictured sirens do the beckoning.
Stick to quack medicines and suchlike potions
Acclaimed as cures for various aches and fads,
You chaps who specialise in hoardings notions,
But oh! beware of meretricious ads,
Portrayals liable to stir emotions
In overly impressionable lads!
The uglier 1 features that these boards present,
You’ll note, the less the risk of accident.

“Curate’s Egg”: The fact that one
Army man didn’t swear —the peak of
his profanity was “bally”—paid divi-
dends during the battle for No. 3 airstrip,
Milne Bay. During a night engagement
the genteel loot was orally directing
mortars from an o.p. so situated that it
was easy for infiltrating Japs to miscall
his fire-orders and so deceive the sig.
relaying the commands by telephone. As
on other occasions the Nips lent false
authenticity to their fake orders by inter-
polating Aussie swear-words. The mortar
boys had just straddled their target, a
concentration of Nips in weapon-pits,
when, in obedience to a Jap-called order,
they lifted their range to drop harmlessly
in the jungle. Then came the order,
voiced with considerable asperity: “I
»said bally well down, not bally well up! ”
The mild expletive dispelled all doubts as
to the identity of the issuer of that order.
The next bombs were right on target.

“H.A.L.”: Wanting to check some in-
formation about the Pacific Islands in
the ’nineties, I went to the library of a
learned society which had been described
to me as “full of old but good books
which .seldom leave the shelves.” I
found exactly what I required— Funafuti,
written by the wife of Edgeworth David,
who took a diamond-drilling rig to that
island to test Darwin’s theory of the
origin of coral atolls. The book listed
everything on which I needed corrobora-
tive evidence, particularly the errors
made by missionaries, which include
making a Polynesian congregation sit on
pews and fidget with discomfort instead
of letting them sit where they are com-
fortable, on the floor ; making the women
and girls give up that pretty and sensible
garment the bark-strip skirt and dress
in the hot and hideous Mother Hubbard.
I found the book a mine of information,
written in a readable style by a com-
petent observer. But here is the remark-
able thing; that book was published in
the early ’nineties and had been presented
to the library in 1923, but before I could
read it I had to cut the pages. A stroll
around the library showed other books
with uncut pages, and I saw some rare-
first editions and collectors’ pieces as well.
Do all learned societies make as little
use of their books?

“Looker-on Junior”: Statistics may
prove that women drivers have fewer ac-
cidents than, men, but it Was only the
other day that I discovered the reason.
The day was a sizzler, and I was waiting
in a Brisbane suburb for a friend to pick
me up and deliver me at my favorite
swimming spot. When she turned up,
nearly two hours later, she blithely in-
formed me that as she was nervous about
driving across the line of traffic heading
for the south-coast beaches, she had de-
cided to turn into the stream and await
a lull to enable her to turn. She made
her turn at last —20 miles down the cqast.

“Blue P.”: A Melbourne paper notes
that with the approach of the Christmas
holidays Uni. students can get plenty of
casual work at good pay: £7 12s. as
shop-hands, £7 with bonuses in some
factories, £7 10s. to £lO 10s. for tempo-
rary railway porters, big money for har-
vest hands and fruit-pickers, with less
but still good money for girls. In a
country where a. benevolent Federal Gov-
ernment' makes financial grants to the
children of poorer people to enable them
to take University courses you’d have
thought this casual work would be a good
thing, since the money so earned would
enable the student the better to pay his
way. But it ain’t so. The rich man’s
son or daughter can take the jobs without
hesitation, but if an “assisted student”
does it his earnings are deducted from
next year’s grant. Aside from the money
aspect, it’s a good thing for youngsters
“Know anything about chip-heaters ?”
to work and hobnob with others in their
spare time, but the so-called working-
man’s Government at Canberra ap-
parently doesn’t think so.

“Nakh”: A genuine Australian
failed to get a bid at a recent auctio'n
in Melbourne. It was a piano belonging
to the Henty family—possibly the first of
its kind to be brought to Australia. When
the Hentys made their landing at Port-
land (Vic.) the instrument landed with
them, so it was certainly the first Vic-
torian piano. Tall, carved, upright, with
the familiar tapestry fa?ade, it is still
capable of responding to the touch of
suburban virtuosi.

“South Coast”: “Bo” forgets that some
fellows have the misfortune to be born
with “tight little waves arranged with
mathematical precision” (B. 10/11 /’4B).
My own kids grew up to view with dis-
gust the hair their sisters would have
given anything to possess. Having asked
Mum why she gave them a “rotten
perm,” the boys used to slop it with
water and brush it flat, only to find that
the more they tried to flatten that hair
the more it rejoiced and shone in pansy
waves. Their only compensation is the
thought that their own daughters may
inherit it.

“Pitt St.”; I was in a mate’s car when
he put out his hand in the approved
fashion to signal his intention to stop.
It was one of Sydney’s busiest intersec-
tions. We stopped. Five seconds later
there was a severe bump. He looked
round and met the indignant gaze of a
lady driver. “Madam,” *he said, with
gentle reproach, “didn’t you see my
hand?” “Yes,” she retorted. “But I
was in a hurry.”

“Imlay Saunders”; My grandfather,
Peter Imlay, mentioned (B. 29/9/’4B) aS
one of the pioneers of Eden district
“Come on —you Wouldn't earn your salt in a steam-laundry !”
(N.S.W.), came over to New Zealand
about 1846 in his own schooner, his
family following later. He settled finally
in the Wanganui district, took up about
six or seven thousand acres and named
his home Balgownie after his birthplace
in Scotland. He died in 1881, aged 90,
and is buried in the family graveyard with
his wife, two daughters and my father.
In addition to farming he took many
trips to the islands in his schooner, some
lasting two or three years. From my
parents I lehrned that he was a tremen-
dously big man, 6ft. 4in. tall, very power-
ful and with a violent temper. Old
Peter was deeply interested in the breed-
ing of thoroughbred horses, and brought
some original bloodstock to this country.
The love of horses has come down
through the generations. My mother,
Jessie Imlay, and Mary and Jennie Imlay
were expert horsewomen. They broke
in their own horses and had a. great repu-
tation as show*riders.

“Bicuspid”: The greyhound that
“stopped like a shot out of a gun and
then folded up” (B. 3/11/ ’4B) had
nothing on a performance noted by
Adelaide “ Tiser” on 26/10/ ’4B. An-
nouncing that a grasshopper plague was
unlikely this year, the paper gravely gave
the reason as due to the fact that “Those
which reached Adelaide died before they
laid their eggs.” A hjuly remarkable
instance of post mortem ovulation.
“Unity”: Tell “Tos” (B. 10/11/’4B)
there was a felt-hat industry in Australia
well over 55 years ago. The Victorian
Felt Hatters’ Union was started in 1874,
so there must have felt-hatters before that.
The Victorian union continued until 1911,
when it amalgamated with similar bodies
in N. S. Wales and South Australia to
form the Federated Felt Hatting Em-
ployees’ Union of Australasia.

“Spokeshave”: According to a London
cable the King’s secretary called up the
London County Council the other day
and said: “What is going to happen to
the lions?” The cryptic remark referred
to a report that the development plan for
the south bank of the Thames for the
1951 exhibition involved the disappear-
ance/of two stone lions from the top of
a disused brewery. His Majesty had
often observed the animals grinning de-
fiantly at the skyline after a blitz and had
developed an affection for them. The
council decided to preserve the lions and
incorporate them in the exhibition, A
pity there isn’t a king in Melbourne.
Every time some board or other decides
to demolish a lovely old building, re-
move an avenue of poplars or ruin a
foreshore with a concrete embankment
there are a babble of tongues and a spate
of letters to the papers, conflicting
authorities argue and before the con-
troversy has half-started the building
is down or the embankment finished.
There is no person who hasn’t an
axe to grind or with sufficient prestige
for his opinion to carry weight.

“Plop”; Gas-shortage over, the
restaurant cooked once more on all
burners. I was determined not to shoot
until I saw the whites of their pies, and
made sure that those creamy underbellies,
which appear when they knock the tins
off, were steaming hot befitting the pastry-
mince combination that ha‘d made the
establishment famous. The pies of yester-
day were chilly, but today’s were slowly
taking warmth, so I waited and listened
for the signal. The counter-girls who had
been saying “The pies aren’t very hot”
were now proclaiming that they were
“getting warmer.” Not long now! My
mouth was watering: “They’ll be hot
soon.” Then, as a girl told someone that
they were “piping-hot,” I made my
charge, only to see the last of those
circular portions of culinary ecstasy go
off to the glutton ahead of me. I had
to be content with a cheese-roll.

“Pongo”: Don’t know about the most
enduring hats, but the cady with the
shortest useful existence was the straw
decker into which we lads poked our
nappers in the 90’s. Made of white or
black-and-white straw, they were stiff as
a board and the serrated brim-edge
would, in the hands of an expert, inflict
a gash that the Razor Gang would have
envied. Their expectation of life was one
month. They were easily damaged ; a
good shower of rain reduced them to a
soggy mass of stickiness. Average cost
was half-a-crown.

“Never Again”: The harmful effects
of whisky-and-oysters are fleabites to
the results of peanuts-and-beer, I’ve
never done it since the night I took
a flapper to a pub 15 miles along a
mountain road for a few beers and a spot
of music. When we arrived the only in-
habitants of the lounge were a well-
dressed giant and a gaudy blonde, both so
far gone that they looked like thumping
the piano unmusically for the rest of the
night. The chap behind the bar was
quite sympathetic when I complained,
and presently delivered to the couple a
concoction which looked like beer.
Fifteen minutes later I helped the bar-
tender lay them out in their car. With
the piano to ourselves we played,
munched peanuts and drank beer. It was
fairly late when a carload of couples
arrived. They must have liked our play-
ing because they all stood around, and
after a while insisted on buying us two
fresh beers. It was soon after that that
the peanuts started to argue with the
beer. We woke up next morning still out-
side the pub in the car.

“Ike Hollar”: Slips in expression crop
up in the written word also. Here’s one
shown me the other day; it was from
a communication from a well-known firm
of solicitors: “As it is essential that action
should be taken upon the lines outlined
above without delay, if you should fail
to receive this letter, please notify us of
such non-receipt without delay, also in-
forming us of your change of address, so
that a copy can be sent to you there,
immediately.” The letter was received
without delay ; the man who wrote it has
been trying to get it back ever since.

“Zake”; That a crane, according to
British migrants on the Italian liner
Toscana bound from Genoa to Aus-
tralia, had to load cargo at each port
through the centre of a dormitory scarcely
merits passing mention. Remember that
floating Christmas-tree the Montecuccioli,
which was out here for the sesquicen-
tenary celebrations in 1938? If any of
the crew had sneezed while above decks,
let a gun being fired, half the top
hamper cluttering every inch of space
between stem and stern would have gone
overboard. Itie ships are all like that.
The diary left by my grandfather reveals
that he had similar congestion troubles
on a trip he once took from Goa to
Whoa in the liner Verrigreasi. One end
of his cabin, through which ran the
propeller-shaft, bisected a part of the
galley. Through a corner of the other
end was the only ingress to the store-room
where they kept the olive oil, which was
used for both culinary and lubrication
purposes. The other corner led directly
to the sick-bay. Sometimes a gang would
come from the engine-room at around
2 a.m. and would shove grandfather’s
detachable bunk through into the sick-
bay, where he often copped a dose of
jalap or was awakened at 4 a.m. for a
wash. In heavy weather the vibration
from the shaft when the propeller left
the water would shoot him in among the
pots in the galley, where he would be
half-drowned in spaghetti. What led him
at last to demand other quarters was that
one side of his chassis developed a heat-
rash while the other got frostbite through
having the aft stacks along one wall and
the freezing-chamber along the other. For
the rest of the voyage he got a com-
fortable doss in the coal-bunker.
JOBS FOR THE BOYS.
“Supply Minister Strauss, introducing the bill for
nationalising the iron and steel industries in the House
of Commons, pointed out that it would enable the
Government to ‘cut out the deadwood from manage-
ments below standard and appoint new men, many
of whom would be drawn from ranks not normally
considered for posts of high responsibility.’ Opposi-
tion cries of ‘Jobs for the boys’!”
Too right! So it needn’t occasion surprise
That the Socialist fetish to nationalise
Whatever it can, from the mines to the banks,
Is highly regarded in Labofite ranks.
Whenever they manage to carry it through,
There’s one thing at least it will certainly do,
Provide, in deciding on whom it employs,
New billets for stalwarts, more jobs for the boys.
It may or it may not —it’s anyone’s guess—
Result in industrial troubles the less,
Though history teaches that men are as like,
When the State is their boss, to embark on a
strike
As when they’re beholden for all they may earn
To some notably capitalistic concern.
But, whatever illusion the system destroys,
It’s bound to be lavish in jobs for the boys.
Under Labor control —so the tub-thumpers tell —
Iron and steel will be better, and cheaper as well,
And the profits accruing in hefty amounts
Diverted from plutocrats’ banking accounts.
They’ll go to the State, as they rightfully should,
For every citizen’s ultimate good,
To add to the blessings the country enjoys
In the prospect of further good jobs for the
boys.
Well, only the future will tell us, you know.
I wonder how far these fanatics will go
In their addlebrained ardor new schemes to
devise,
And what next they’ll be seeking to nationalise.
Will breweries and taverns be placed on the list
Of things to be grabbed with a forcible fist?
Maybe. But behind all the shouting and noise
You mustn’t forget there’ll be jobs for the boys.

Every single
ounce counts if
you’re harvesting
flower seed. It’s a touchy operation.
You know if your equipment can master
this one, it, can save many extra pounds
of other types of seeds,*such as grasses,
legumes, small grains, peas and beans.
The Allis - Chalmers ALL - CROP
Harvester is the uncanny machine which
is successfully handling thousands of
acres of flow-er seeds, from sweet peas
to tiny, fine-Screen petunia seed.

THE MAN
Policy and Command
in Japan.
“Ek Dum” (just returned from
Nippon): The forces of “demo-
cracy” have been in control in
Japan for three years upon a
plan which was framed in the
days of Mr. Roosevelt and the
succeeding period of “Potsdam”
and at a time when Allied
“statesmen” followed Marshal
Stalin round with admiration and
adopted his ideas as a matter of
course.
One could imagine that if
General MacArthur, who has
the handling of the situation,
had much to do with the fram-
ing of the plan he must deeply
regret it, since the existing policy
is not easy to apply, and “allies,”
especially Australia and the
U.S.S.R., are making the task
harder by demanding an open
season for trade-unionism in all
spheres in accordance with the
new Japanese constitution
which means a free run for
Communist organisations.
General MacArthur is a man
of remarkable vigor, and it
is almost impossible on sight
to credit him with his 68
years. He is the hardest worker
in Japan, and seems to thrive
on it. His working days in the
week are seven, often from early
morning till midnight. He keeps
aloof from the public, which
normally sees him only when he
drives to and fro between the
American Embassy, where he
lives, and the Dai Ichi Insurance
Building, where he works. But
his procedure, which involves
endless study and consultation
and makes him in a broad
sense as well-informed as any in
Japan, and his detachment prob-
ably allows him to exercise his
judgment coolly and to keep a
much closer eye on the Govern-
ment than those administrators
who are always in a crowd,
always so close to the earth that
there is no perspective in their
view of what is going on.
Seeing General MacArthur
The visitor who sees General
MacArthur goes to the Dai Ichi
Building and is routed without
escort to an upper floor where he
presently finds his own way
past a sentry to the ante-room
occupied by the General’s two
aides, both of whom have been
in Australia —one of them to
sufficient purpose to marry a
very charming Australian girl.
After an interval for reminis-
cences he is ushered into the
General’s room, which is furn-
ished in soft greys with sofas and
deep chairs. Its main ornament
is a large clock above the door.
He is met at the door by a keen,
vigorous, slim man, dark and
trim and not so tall as his pic-
tures suggest, who shakes hands
firmly and makes a bee-line for
a group of seats and sofas in the
far corner of the room, sits his
caller down comfortably, settles
himself where he can consult the
clock unobtrusively, produces an
old, half-filled pipe out of his
shirt - and - slacks uniform, on
which he wears no ribbons,
utters a few sentences of greet-
ing which show that he has been
well briefed, asks after Aus-
tralian friends and then lets the
conversation take its own course.
When the caller leaves in per-
haps an hour or a little more, he
goes away with a feeling that a
good time has been had by all,
that the General is an unusual
man with the seeds of greatness
in him, that he has a clear and
encyclopasdic mind, and a
minutely detailed knowledge of
the subjects which interest-him.
He has given the impression
of being simple and direct. His
answers have come pat, and he
has shown a very human warmth
about one or two matters, and
once or twice has not hesitated
to say openly, with a mild
emphasis attached, that he
“doesn’t know” —a rare and re-
freshing admission from any-
body who aspires to the stature
of a “statesman.” He does not
hurry himself, and he does not
expect his vis-a-vis to be merely
a listener. He has plenty of
questions of his own.
When it is all over you feel
that if his lot had been cast in
different places he would have
fitted very well into the brother-
hood of the old, lean western-
station men of the type of
Crouch of Alroy, weather- and
worldly-wise, and that anyway
it would be not unpleasant to
know him better, and sometimes
to sit on a fence and help him
smoke a reminiscent pipe after
dinner. And that is a feeling
which you don’t get about many
men of affairs after 40 years of
trafficking with the breed. The
Japanese who have dealt with
him seem to have the same sort
of feeling. He is one of the few
who have made any headway
with them.
The Australian Contrast
8.C.0.F.’s operation of its oc-
cupation diverges in method
from that of the Supreme Com-
mander today. _ _ ,
What this achieves it is impos-
sible for a casual visitor to esti-
mate, though it illustrates the
sectionalism of the Allied Com-
mand. The onlooker can only
report what he sees.
The 8.C.0.F. method is well
illustrated by what happens on
a tour of the Commander-in-
Chief, Lieutenant - General
Robertson, who works hard and
earnestly at his job, but whose
method is the antithesis of that
of General MacArthur, He be-
lieves in personal contact and
personal guidance of his charges,
carried out with some pomp.
Tour in Japan
The tour begins from Kure
railway station. There are two
special trains. These are
primarily to serve the purposes ,
of General Robertson, the
C.-in-C,, and Brigadier Hopkins,
who commands the 34th Bri-
gade, A.M.F. —an entity which
seems to comprise the ancillaries
of a full brigade group serving
three battalions whose strength
is so low that in operational
practice they could scarcely
make one fighting battalion.
On the first special train there
are four large staff cars, a
guard, two white M.P. jeeps with
crews to play head and tail to
processions, also some other an-
cillaries. On the other train are
a coach for staff, a coach forthe
brigadier and his wife and the

ZINCANNEAL is a special zinc-coated sheet. By high
temperature treatment zinc is combined with a steel base
to form a strong coating having remarkable properties.
The resistance to atmospheric corrosion is particularly
good, excellent service being obtained under severe
conditions such as those in coastal locations. This sheet
takes paint readily, without priming.
ZINCANNEAL is produced in both flat and corrugated
sheets.
•%
Corrugated ZINCANNEAL is made in RED and BLUE
qualities. RED ZINCANNEAL for roofing, siding, and
for maximum rigidity. BLUE ZINCANNEAL for curving.
Deliveries are still dependent upon official allocation and
made instead of Galvanized sheet. All applications
must be made through the usual channels and on the
appropriate form.
This advertisement is published to overcome confusion
existing in some quarters concerning ZINCANNEAL. This
sheet is not to be confused with lead-coated roofing Ternes,
which were a Wartime substitute for both ZINCANNEAL
and Galvanized sheet. ZINCANNEAL sheets are excellent for
roof water catchment and in no way affect the water quality.

public-relations officer and one
lone journalist; finally an obser-
vation-coach for the C.-in-C.
Each coach in this train has its
own kitchen and lounge-room,
individual sleeping compartments
and shower-room.
We set off along the lovely
coast of the Inland Sea. Pre-
sently the train slows up. We
look out the window and see, in
the distance on a railway
platform, a sweating local
Mayor in morning-coat and
striped pants, the town council
in a variety of garb which looks
as if it had been borrowed from
Madame Tussaud’s, the local
close - shaven schoolchildren
drawn up in rows and two small
girls in brilliant ceremonial
kimonos loaded with flowers.
Our descent to the platform is
an imposing business r — the
neatly-pressed khaki, the scarlet
tabs and staff caps and gold
braid make a pretty picture. All
that follows is routine. It hap-
pens with variations, according
to time available and import-
ance, in town after town in
Okayama prefecture and else-
where, as Shikoku Island, which
the C.-in-C. previously toured.
The Mayor conducts the proces-
sion out of the station after the
ladies have been presented with
flowers. Here is a scene to stir
any democrat.
Our guard is drawn up with
fixed bayonets in the bigger
towns. The paraphernalia of
“present arms,” inspection and
general salute, bugle and all, are
gone through. His Worship the
Mayor (or the Governor if we
are in a prefectural capital) steps
forward and begins to unroll
what looks like a small white
window-blind. A burst of sound
like machine-gun fire hits the
heavens, and you realise that he
is reading “the address.”
It is, when translated, usually
flowery and sometimes full of
unconscious humor. Occasion-
ally it is poetic and hopes that
the C.-in-C.. will benefit greatly
in health by coming to this
region of blossoming flowers,
balmy airs and scented pine-
woods.
Once it referred gracefully to
the ecstasy and emotion of the
city council at beholding the
charming figures of the wives of
the High Command. Always it
pays some grateful tribute to the
impact of high-souled Western
culture (as represented by
8.C.0.F. Command) upon the
once-benighted, but now-re-
formed, Japanese. And it
almost invariably ends on the
utilitarian note:
Commercial and industrial activi-
ties have been gradually revived to
the extent of 45 and 60 per cent,
respectively of the pre-war level. Our
reconstruction programme, as planned
at the outset, called for a five-year
emergency recovery plan with an ex-
penditure of 2,037,040,000 yen
(£A2,500,000) and a 15-year-limit
permanent reconstruction plan of
6,000,000,000 yen The question
foremost in our mind today is how
to obtain the resources necessary for
the financing of pur reconstruction
programme We are, however, de-
termined to establish a city worthy
of becoming a memorial to peace
May we humbly request your Excel-
lency for continued guidance and
assistance in our endeavors.
This bit from Hiroshima,
which, it will be noted, proposes
to carry out a permanent recon-
struction of six square miles of
completely obliterated city for a
total of about £A7,500,000.
One expects the C.-in-C. to
rush up and embrace his Wor-
ship, demanding that he should
come at once to Australia and
teach us his financial technique.
But normally General Robertson
ignores financial sallies and
elects to concentrate on two sub-
jects—a hint or two at Japan’s
continuing war-guilt and the
need for the reform of the
Japanese social structure along
Western lines.
The Ladies Bless Them!
Having listened to the
Mayor’s address, he puts his
monocle firmly in his eye, gazes
sternly at the multitude and
usually says to his interpreter;
“Tell them that I am glad to be,
here and am impressed with
their welcome, but I am sur-
prised to see that so few members
of the city council are married.”
Surprised looks appear on the
faces of the city elders as this is
translated. . It appears that they
are all married.
“Then where are their wives?”
asks the C.-in-C. in astonish-
ment. “Why are they not here?
I bring my wife —why don’t
they bring their wives?”
He then gives a short lecture
on women’s rights. Great stress
is laid by the Command on the
need to place domestic relations
on a Western basis.
We are off, a procession of
staff cars with M.P. jeeps fore
and aft, to inspect and pass
judgment upon art galleries, hos-
pitals and, of course, rayon fac-
tories, where the directors come
forth with samples in the form
of rolls of material for the
ladies, and the huge staffs line
the gardened approaches and
cheer as if we were Bradman or
the bread-cart.
At the station, when we re-
entrain, hundreds of school-
children, perhaps thousands, are
drawn up to represent the
citizenry, whose adults, apart
from the normal population of
streets, are often conspicuously
absent. There are wild, even de-
lirious banzais and hurrahs, or
the massed youth of the city
sings “Auld Lang Syne” or some
such tune, though, unfortu-
nately, in Japanese, so that one
cannot decide whether the accent
in “Will ye no come back again”
is on the “will” or the “no.”
But whatever the spirit in which
it is accorded, it is a remarkable
exhibition of something.
Official circles agree that the
meeting exudes spontaneous
affection for and trust in the
now almost all - Australian
British Commonwealth regime.
More intimate observers are
not so sure. Some distrustful
fellows there are, with long ex-
perience of Japan, who believe
that it is a sort of passive-re-
sistance demonstration in which
the innocent little children are
made to do the dirty work of
bowing to the victor while the
adults, whose opinions really
matter, stay away working like
beavers to produce the day
when a recovered Japan with
power to bargain need have no
salute for would-be dominant
foreign elements better than a
thumb raised 10" the tip of a
very short Oriental nose.
It is upon occasions like this
that onlookers are glad that Aus-
tralian newspapers are not gener-
ally available in Nippon. If they
were some innocent Japanese
might die laughing on discover-
ing that the bayoneted guard
which accompanies thfe C.-in-C.’s
expeditions represents about
five per cent, of the whole armed
expeditionary infantry might of
our all-conquering Common-
wealth wherever our flag flies.

PERSONAL ITEUS
For their share in cruiser Perth’s fight
in the Java Sea, Lt. Lloyd Burgess,
R.A.N.R. (Seagoing), and Commissioned
Electrician Cecil Vowles, R.A.N., were
decorated this month with the order of the
Dutch Knight of Orange Nassau. Burgess
entered the Service through a side-door,
as it were, from the Merchant Navy, and
Vowles, originally a lower-deckman, came
up through the hawse-pipe. Lt.-Col.
Wright, Netherlands Consul in Mel-
bourne, pinned the gongs.
B. A. Longfield, retiring from the job
of Victorian secretary to the Transport
Officers’ Association, might be considered
a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by
any who may regard Freud, Jung,
Adler and chaps of that ilk as in
league with the devil. For the last 12
years Longfield has spent his day-hours
organising the affairs of an employees’
association. When he closes the office
door he becomes a psychologist bent on
tracking down complexes in the dark
realm of the unconscious. His researches
into analytical psychology have recently
earned him a fellowship of the British
Federation of Psychiatrists and the In-
ternational Association of Psychologists
and Sociologists. And he isn’t an ama-
teur, either —he comes under the profes-
sional title. His distinction was partly
earned by his advocacy of morale and the
human factor in the management of the
State’s railways.
While Albert Namatjira, the abo. artist,
has been’ selling out at Melbourne
Athenaeum—his show of fewer than 50
pictures was priced at £1500—Aus-
tralia House is preparing to give
a sight of the work of himself
and his pupils. The paintings there won’t
be for sale, however. They belong to
L. A. Borgelt, of Adelaide, a motor-cycle
agent and garage proprietor, who is visit-
ing England and who was one of the first
to buy the Arunta artist’s pictures.
* The shore-bound charts in the Marine Editor’s
cabin shook with anticipation—or it may have
been with the voice that rolled through the
door like a Force Six wind. The barrel-
girthed, red-faced man who followed it had
obviously reefed a sail in a Cape Horn blow,
and he gripped the M.E.’s hand with a force
that suggested he hadn’t forgotten how to.
“Captain Bob Stewart’s the name, and I mind
the time when The Bulletin was the seaman’s
bible. I was in a paper once meself. Along-
side Vancouver in ’02—chief of the old Moana
at the time—na sparky young reporter from the
‘World’ climbed aboard and asked why we
had a list. I called to the engineer. ‘Hey,
Chief,’ I yelled. ‘Have you finished pumpin’
them starb’d tanks?’ ‘Aye,’ grinned Jock,
always on for a joke. ‘Right. Then I’ll get
’em folded and stowed thick in the forepeak.’
‘What’s this?’ nosed the paper-man. ‘Foldin’
tanks?’ ‘Sure,’ says I. ‘Haven’t you heard of
the new India-rubber tanks that fold up and
save stowage-space?’ So next day there I was
in half a column about the Australian ship and
its new invention. I remember the time two
days out from Suva” And the charts
listened, and remembered the mast-lights of
tall ships growing pale in the dawnlight, the
ring of chipping-hammers, the roar of a mon-
soon whipping near-by swells into smoke, and
the water breaking into a radiant dust of gold
under the sunbound stem of a ’Frisco clipper.
The M.E., too, remembered. “How are you
liking retirement, Captain?” “Retirement!'”
the voice swelled. “I wouldn’t be retired now if
I wasn’t under petticoat government and kid-
ridden.” The voice lowered regretfully to half-
a-gale. “Now I’m second-mate of a north-
shore fowlhouse.” And the charts curled in
sympathy.
Away from the spur and clash of
action, it took cold courage to resist the
sort of torture the Japs dealt in. For
his share of it Fl.-Sgt. Stanley Wood-
bridge, of the R.A.F.V.R., was recently
awarded a posthumous George Cross.
Shot down in a Liberator over Burmese
jungle in 1945, six of the crew were
caught by the Japs, who tortured them
and beheaded five. Then the Japs con-
centrated on Woodbridge for information
on wireless equipment, secret codes and
wave-lengths. The worst torture was
reserved for the last. After a brutal
kicking and bashing with swords, he was
taken to the place of execution, and
there, when it was obvious to the un-
fortunate prisoner that he was to be
murdered, they finally interrogated
him. The only result was a request from
the gallant fellow that they get it over
quickly. He was beheaded after eight
days of continuous, and fruitless, torture.
Later, an Allied Military Court hanged
three of his murderers.
Sir Patrick Abercrombie, the noted
British townplanner, remarked in Ade-
laide that he wasn’t allowed to see any
slums in Melbourne. Instead of making
a merit of it, secretary McNamara, of
the Town and Planning Board, explained
by saying that Sir Patrick spent only
five days in Melbourne, most of them
round the Royal Melbourne, which he
described as the finest hospital he had
seen on his travels. Anyway, Sir Patrick,
at a Uni. address, said that conscientious
people had been showing him the less
attractive city features, though he wanted
to see the city’s beauties. Perhaps he was
referring to the Tivoli lovelies. He has
a commission for designing a new hospi-
tal for Ceylon before he gets back to
England to take a hand in London’s
face-lift.
Vic Mann has seen his last picture. At
the beginning a Sydney architect, he won
a gold medal for draughtsmanship and
design, went on to study under Julian
Ashton, Tom Roberts and Streeton, and,
engaged to catalogue the State’s National
Gallery collection, became its director in
1905, holding the job 24 years. He also
ran the Macleod Galleries when -they
were housed on the top-floor of 252
George-street. Mann had voluminous
memories of the Sydney art world of his
day. There is, for instance, the story of
the tall visitor who was found standing
long and sadly before the fine picture of
the bloody affair at Rorke’s Drift. He'
turned out to be the heroic clergyman
who is a central figure in the tragedy and
the painting, and the discovery started a
friendship which brought Mann a bundle
of interesting data about the affair and
the artist who recorded it. Mann’s father
was a member of Leichhardt’s expedition
in 1846.

Sir Harold Hartley, chairman of
8.0.A.C., in Australia via one of his
Lancastrians for personal inspection of
his airline’s organisation, is a man of
obvious vigor, and, though frosty-pated,
seems just as young in eye and heart as
when he made his first flight over the
Somme in 1916 to observe smoke-screens,
for whose effect, as chemical adviser to
the Third Army in France, he was then
responsible. A scientist and F.R.S., he
led the Allied mission into Germany to
report on the Hun’s chemical factories.
His foresight just before the second holo-
caust broke laid in enormous stocks of
fuel for Britain’s bombers and fighters,
and his knowledge of the enemy’s stocks
directed those bombers after them. As
chairman of the F.1.D.0. scientific com-
mittee, he reversed his first-war role and
ensured that returning bombers found
their runways cleared of fog-screens. Re-
signing all his diverse interests after the
war. Sir Harold joined 8.0.A.C. in 1946.
He’s remembered also by Britons, from
the King downwards, as the drawer of the

during the Island’s fuel-saving drive.

minding John of his first Bulletin con-
tribution, a poem called “Lord; Think of
the Lambs!” which appeared in the old
“Bards of the Backblocks” column in
1897. John first read his poem in print

called at 252 George-street to talk to the
Red Page about books, and mentioned,
forgivingly, that he had more than once
been insulted in “Answers to Correspon-
dents.” The Red Page had also, long
ago, been there insulted. A bond was
established. The Red Page spoke with
proper appreciation of Around the Boree
Log; John O’Brien, tilting 6ft. north
and 6ft. south in, around and beyond a
totally inadequate chair (which happened
to have been purloined for the occasion
from “Old-timer,” for whose ballads he
professed an admiration), spoke courte-
ously of the Red Page. The bond be-
came firmer. John O’Brien spoke with
warmth of Archibald, Edmond, S. H.
Prior, Lawson, Ogilvie, Paterson, Rod
Quinn (whom he had recently visited),
Norman Lindsay’s Saturdee, Scorfield’s
cartoons, and the brilliant and neglected
short stories of Ted Dyson. The bond
became indissoluble and unbreakable.

also M.Sc. with honors. At Victoria
College Lowe won the mathematics and
physics prizes. Assisted by ex-students
of Wellington Tech., he entered Cam-
bridge, and in two years passed the mathe-
matical tripos. Now word has reached
New Zealand that the Chinese lad has
been awarded a senior scholarship and
a Ministry of Supply scholarship, valued
at £300, which will enable him to con-
tinue his engineering research at Cam-
bridge.
Into the silence: —
At Wollongong, suddenly, at 64, Arthur
George Hardwick, S.M., for 20 yedrs a magis-
trate, 10 of them a P.M. in N.S.W. South Coast
towns, the remainder on the bench in Sydney.
Two sons, one a barrister, another a solicitor,
are keeping the name alive in court, a third
is a dentist and a sister is a high-school mistress,
all four products of Sydney University.
In New York, .Mrs. Edith Melby Cook,
a one-time circus star. She toured Europe, Smith
America, South Africa and India as a bareback
rider with Wirth’s until she went to the U.S.A.
in 1926.
At Kew, Melbourne, Rev. Father Hermann
Nekes, linguist and anthropologist. He was a
missionary in the Cameroons, taught for 20
years in Limburg, Germany, and came to Aus-
tralia in 1935 to study aboriginal languages.
His dictionary of tribal tongues, the result of
eight years’ study, will be published shortly.
At Toogoolawah (Q.), at 73, Herbert Edward
Baker, widely-known pastoralist of the northern
State. A great traveller who left Charleville for
three world trips, he wrote one book on what
he’d seen and had another in hand when the
end came.
From one of them: —
McBeath’s impression of Haydn James (B.
3/11/ ’48) reminded me of mid-war years
in Melbourne. “Jimmie” conducted the
W.A.A.A.F. choir until ha was posted to his
initial aircrew training. Rehearsals were full
of variety, tender-skinned girls shrinking from
his heartfelt appeal to “put some guts into it,
girls! Don’t be so virginal!” When he left
us, the former pianist stepped into his place
as baton-wielder. Under Verdon Williams the
choir became widely known. Air Minister
Drakeford had a habit of commandeering its
services for loan rallies at Moonee Ponds, and
the girls today can boast that they’ve sung in
the Melbourne Town Hall. With war’s end
Haydn’s Harem, which became Verdon’s
Virgins, merged with the R.A.A.F. Choir, and,
inviting membership from all Service bodies,
formed the present Services Commemoration
Musical Society under, the baton of Alan
Dudley.


Women's letters
From Melbourne
A fine record of service was apparent
in the report read at the third annual
meeting of the Air Force Women’s
Association held at Leura, Toorak-road.
The patroness of the association, Lady
Dugan, was present, and Mrs. Beatrice
Campbell presided. The most notable
feature of the report was that branches
of the association had been established at
R.A.A.F. stations at Wagga, East Sale,
Amberley, Archerfield and Townsville.
Still a very important objective of this
group of women is the Memorial Scholar-
ship Fund, which now totals £3OOO. Food
parcels valued at £3OO have been sent to
England, and work for the Fat for Britain
Appeal still goes on. The association
maintains a bed at the After-Care Hos-
pital, and over 200 garments have been
given to the Melbourne District Nursing
Society. Mrs. E. C. Wackett is president
of the association; Mrs. John Black is
hon. secretary and Mrs. W. J. Cameron
hon. treasurer. During the afternoon
Group-Captain Campbell, leader of the
Australian National Antarctic Expedition,
spoke on his experien«es. Farewells were
said at the meeting to Mrs. Walters, wife
of Air-Commodore A. L. Walters, who
will leave on January 11 for England with
her daughter Robin, who will study
dramatic art there ; Mrs. B. I. Fraser, an-
other committee member, who leaves for
England in February; and Mrs. Prick-
man, who with her husband, Air-
Commodore T. B. Prickman, R.A.F.,
returns to England by the Stratheden on
December 15.
The drawing-room of Menzies’ was
the venue for the fashion parade pre-
sented by Maurice Dowd. Mannequins
showed the grey suit in soft flannel, with
the low nipped-in waist; there were
comfortable action-back jackets and
generously pleated skirts in varicolored
Donegals. After-five-o’clock velveteen
suits showed a flattering array of colors
and a variety of styles; there were the
slick mess jacket with a fitting skirt; the
longish jacket fitting snugly at the waist
and with slightly flared, deep-rolled
revets ; the youthful short jacket and the
skirt slim-fronted and a fully-flared back ;
the jacket with nipped-in waist and flared
padded peplum. A warm russet velour
fashioned the new Tent coat with its
dropped shoulder-line and full-cape back
treatment. The black suit, correct for
all occasions, was presented in the single-
and double-breasted styles; they were
of barathea or mousse cloth ; the skirts
either pleated or pencil-slim. Mrs.
Maurice Dowd hostessed the cocktail
party which followed the parade.
A big audience gave a vociferous wel-
come to the return of the Ballet Rambert
to His Majesty’s, and a generous ovation
to the world premiere of Walter Gore’s
ballet “Winter Night.” Among enthu-
siastic balletomanes were Angela Cass,
who draped a beaten-silver scarf over her
long-sleeved black velvet gown; Nancy
Woodrow and Jean Lean, both in draped
white gowns; Mrs. Wallace Mitchell, in
parma-violet chiffons and hip-length
jacket; Mrs. Norman Spry, wearing an
Edwardian gown of white crepe; Bar-
bara Sloman, whose white evening gown
was worn under a deep-red velvet coat;
Joan and Judith Silk, both of whom wore
finger-tip-length swing-back coats of
striped gold and white taffeta over deep-
cream gowns; Verity Alley, in an off-
the-shoulder black taffeta gown; Mrs.
Jean Patterson, whose ballerina frock
was of pink-and-white-striped taffeta;
Mrs. J. Bowen Pain, her sequin-trimmed
black crepes worn under a shoulder cape
of dyed ermine; Mrs. George Barr, in
midnight-blue taffetas ; Mrs. G. Cornwall,
a full-length grey velvet coat covering
her grey taffetas ; and Madame Stoicesco,
silver foxes covering her black gown.
The sun that shone brightly for the
V.A.T.C. meeting at Caulfield raised a
crop of summery picture hats. One in
black was worn by Mrs. Norman Robin-
son, wife of the chairman of the club,
with her beige ensemble. Mrs. John
Quere added to her grey-silk frock a
small beige straw crowned with a multi-
tude of spring flowers. Mrs. Geoff Grim-
wade’s frock was grey with an etched
pattern of black, the skirt full and swirl-
ing ; her large black straw hat was tied
under the chin with veiling. A pleated
silk frock and a double-decker straw hat
which had one brim amber-toned and
the other black were worn by Sydney
visitor Mrs. K. Ellis. A black hat pro-
vided contrast for Wyn Kellow’s pastel-
blue ensemble. Mrs. M. C. Langslow
wore .a blue-and-white-striped silk frock,
navy coat and large off-white straw hat
trimmed with strawberry-toned ribbon.
Mrs. Nigel Prichard’s navy frock was em-
broidered in white flower motifs, her
small white straw hat clustered with white
roses. Mrs. Fred Dennett’s black frock
featured the new “tube” silhouette ; her
dull-green straw bonnet was ruched with
black. A duck-egg-green silk frock and
large white coarse-straw hat made effect-
ive combination for Mrs. Harry Furnell.
Mrs. A. Walters’s London-tan linen
tailored frock carried a gold belt; her
off-white straw hat was trimmed with
London-tan feather-wings. Lady Beaure-
paire’s printed-silk frock was worn under
a black coat; her small black Bangkok
hat was feather-trimmed. A blue-and-
white-spotted frock and hip-length navy
jacket were worn by Lady Wales with a
small cyclamen straw hat. The navy-and-
white-striped frock worn by Sonya Par-
rish had a floral pattern featured between
the stripes; her large hat was of white
straw.
One of those Welsh towns with an un-
pronounceable name was the birthplace
of Daphne Newton, who prepared for a
theatrical career at the Central School
of Speechcraft, where Laurence Olivier
was also a pupil. Daphne was
“discovered” at a students’ matinee, and
went on tour playing at the age of 18 the
role of a 45-year-old vamp. Sara All-
good chose her for the Bristol Rep., then
she graduated to the West End, playing
in “Cradle Song” with John Gielgud and
later with Emlyn Williams in “Spring
1600 ” In the English production Daphne
played Mrs. Antrobus in “The Skin of
Our Teeth” opposite Olivier. She and her
husband, Peter Gray, have just concluded
a successful season in this city ; he played
the lead in Noel Coward’s “Present
Laughter.” Their small daughter
Bronwyn remained in England while her
parents are on tour.
June Patricia, only daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. George C. Tallis, of Morning-
ton, wore a trained gown of ivory French
faconni poulte for her marriage in the
Melbourne Grammar School Chapel to
George Andrew, eldest son of Mr. and
Mrs. George E. Kirk, of Armadale. The
chiffon yoke was outlined with a leaf
design; the skirt was draped to the back.
Her heirloom Limerick lace veil, mounted
on fine net, was held in place with a
wreath of gardenias; lily-of-the-valley
and gardenias comprised her bouquet.
Jocelyn, sister of the bridegroom, and
Suzanne Tallis, the bride’s cousin, were
the bridesmaids. Their full-skirted gowns
of ivory silk organza were full-skirted,
the bodices having the off-the-shoulder
line. Sprays of small roses and lily-of-
the-valley were worn in their hair, the
flowers being repeated in the bouquets.
lan Sprague was best man and John Kirk
groomsman.
The reception was held at Cliveden
Mansions. Mrs. Tallis received the
guests in a gown of midnight-blue chiffon
and a small wimple-veiled matching hat.
Mrs. Kirk wore a greige crepe romaine
gown and pink taffeta hat, finished with
one rose at one side of the brim. Mrs.
C. J. R. Webb’s dinner gown was of navy
crepe, pin-spotted in white; with it went
a short matching jacket. Mrs. John
Roberts’s floral chiffons were smartly
cut. Mrs. Andrew McHarg’s crepe
romaine frock was fuchsia-toned. Pam
Dixon’s full-skirted ballerina frock was
of navy tulle, in contrast to her sister
Nan’s white crepes. Barbara Selleck was
in billowy mignonette-green tulle.
From Sydney
Color heaped upon color: greens and
blues and reds and golds, the flash of
jewels from breast-plates, headdresses
and girdles, music sensuous, exotic and
tragic, glittering scene upon glittering
scene make “Aida” a very hard opera for
the ladies in the audience to contend
with. No matter what they wear their
clothes seem pallid in comparison with
the life on the stage. Still, it can be said
for Sydney belles that they never say
“Die!” They rallied for last Saturday
night’s gala opening of grand opera, and
the foyer and stairway of the Tivoli were
a parade of new frocks, of fur and
feather capes, of finely-embroidered
Chinese coats, of the jewellery that is
called costume and the jewellery that
would mean real money if you had to
pawn it. The women didn’t have it all
their own way. There were one or two
elderly men who blazed with decorations —
warriors, just as Rhadames, the night’s hero.
And as if all this wasn’t enough the
management flung in the excitement of a
fanfare of trumpets, just before the doors
of stalls and circles closed. Blue was the
prevailing color in the frocks. Tulle,
spreading and ruffled, as blue as our own
summer skies, was worn by a pretty, dark-
haired unknown. It was picturesque
enough for Traviata. Blue tulles were
worn by fair-haired Mrs. Rupert
Scammell, lobelia-blue soft satin, the
bodice all ruched, by the Moxham
lady and cobwebby-blue chiffons by
Margaret Gillespie. With Margaret was
her sister—white and silver her choice—
who is just back from a wonder journey
through U.S. and Canada. The place was
sprinkled with Taits and Fullers. And
why shouldn’t the Taits be- there?
They’re responsible for bringing the opera
to us. Mary Tait, just out from England,
came with her father, Mr. Nevin Tait.
She added grey-fox furs to her soft and
swaying grey-blue chiffons. Bright with
sequins was Mrs. E. J. Tait’s blue frock.
With her was Mrs. Amy Scott of Mel-
bourne, whose frocking suggested purple
and blue iris.
One of the few flashes of red came
from Mrs. H. J. Bradys even-
ing-coat worn with a rose-white frock.
The Fuller lady’s frock wedded two tones
of lilac ; her cape was mink. With her
was Mrs. Rodney Slater, and near by sat
her daughter, Mrs. Rainbow, with Judge
Rainbow. Dr. Clement Chapman was
there with Mrs. Chapman, who sparkled
in dahlia-red chiffons. American writer
Beatrice Borst, very pretty in black, was
there, and Mrs. Norman Lowe. Mrs.
Pierre Mann, Mrs. Florence Taylor,
Mrs. Bertie Kelly, handsome in black
brocades and a pearl-and-diamond tiara,
Evelyn Gardiner, Margaret Salenger,
Agnes Caspers and a trio of opera
principals: Maria Huder, Aldo Ferra-
cutti and Rudolfo Morara, Mrs. Neil
Mayer, whose white tulle frock trailed
water-lilies halfway down the skirt,
and film star Freddie Bartholomew,
boyish, slim and very sensitive of face,
were part of the bright and aniniated
scene in the foyer. The Belgian Minister
brought a party of six.
There was also the gentleman who
muttered, when the curtain went up
showing the interior of the king of
Egypt’s palace with the walls decorated
with spirited horses drawing lightweight
chariots in a he-always-rode-to-wm
fashion: “Say, they must have gone in
for night-trotting, too.” .
Mrs. Nourma Handford, pictured in
this Norton Trevaire photograph, is
busy creating stories for young girls.
This is a side of Australian fiction
which has been rather neglected
since the days of Ethel Turner,
Louise Mack and a small group of their
contemporaries. Collins has just pub-
lished Cotton-trees, which is a continu-
ation in the lives of the young people
in Nourma’s Three Came from Britain.
Before turning her attention to the teen-
agers, Mrs. Handford published a novel
titled High River. '
Monday was Lebanon’s National Day.
Reception by Consul-General H. Shebea
at the Australia on Monday and a great
gathering of the Lebanese people at the
Troc. on Tuesday celebrated the event.
The Norwegian community is noted for
its hospitality, and the wife of Lars
Hvinden Jorstad, Minister of Norway, is
a grand hostess. Her before-Christmas
celebration was the big afternoon affair
of last week. It was a cards-and-conver-
sation afternoon, and the guests were
fifty-fifty between the lure of the bridge-
table and the view of the Harbor bridge,
with the docks and the ferries and the
crouching foreshores as seen from this
penthouse home.
The frocks and hats worn by the guests
were a compliment to summer. The
hostess’s printed silks suggested shining
blue-and-white glazes. A nice note was
the deep white collar and cuffs on Mrs.
A. J. Zylstra’s grey silk linens. Mrs.
Bertie Kelly’s black hat was a froth of
tulle, on which a pink rose swooned. The
Jordan lady, Mrs. C. R. McKerihan, Mrs.
G. Kreiger, Mrs. Malcolm MacKellar,
Mrs. Claude Plowman and the Francis
Anderson lady were among the bridge
players. Mrs. Peter Koch’s ice-blue
crepes were finely knife-pleated, and her
hat was a large grey-blue straw with the
twin of Mrs. Kelly’s rose on the brim.
The “Annie Get Your Gun” company
has many bright ideas; none brighter
than the Play Guild formed almost at the
beginning of this musical comedy’s spec-
tacular rqn. This Guild is a company
within a company and gives all members
of the big cast an opportunity to present
their talents to the public. At 2.15 on
Monday the 29th, the curtain will go
up at the Theatre Royal on the Guild’s
production of “Nothing But the Truth.”
This is a three-act farce, and the special
rnitinee is being given in aid of the
Actors’ Benevolent Fund. Norman Lee
will direct the show.
There is probably no man in Sydney
this week with more of the alphabet after
his name than Lieutenant-General Sir
Bernard Freyberg, Maoriland’s Governor-
General. The especially thrilling ones to
remember are V.C. They bring up all
sorts of heroic pictures of this man with
the quiet, direct gaze and the habit of
listening very attentively to the person
talking to him. He and Lady Freyberg
were smash-hits at the reception Sydney’s
Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress gave
in their honor last Thursday. This was
timed for four o’clock, and it was one
operation got through at the double. By
ten past five the Town Hall was like poor
Tom Moore’s banquet hall —deserted.
Lord Mayor Bartley must have been
hot under his robes of State. Mrs.
Bartley’s printed silks on the contrary
looked salad-cool. Lady Freyberg’s outfit
was fascinating. Her satin suit was the
bluey-grey of a mountain pool. Her
toning hat glistered with plastic bows,
and her shoes were also plastic. The
Harry Moxham lady’s cherry hat was
just the right touch with her cool silks.
Pictorial is the word for Mrs. Keith
Morris’s French-silk crepes, coffee-colored
Mechlin lace ruffling around the V-neck-
line. Hats which came in for notice were
worn by Mrs. Harry Twigden, from
Manly, and Mrs. F. Taplin. The
Parker lady was there, and the Elec-
tricity Cramers found that the bulb of
their popularity was not dimmed in spite
of e.l. restrictions. General Berryman
and his attractive wife, the good-looking
L. A. Robbs, Lieut.-General Freyberg’s
son Paul, acting-Premier Baddeley and
Mrs. Baddeley, and the Town Hall’s
Frank Crane, as usual doing a grand
job, were in this civic rally.
Even without the champagne cocktails
which accompanied the Joe Fallons’ in-
troduction of her to a collection of Sydney
writing and radio people, American
writer Beatrice Borst would have made
instant success. Her smile and her
dimples would make friends for her
anywhere. Miss Borst, who lives in New
York, had a success with her first novel,
Down to Earth, and she has now come
to Australia principally because she has
not been here before. She will go on, to
Maoriland after she has visited the Barrier
Reef and other outcrops of the Aus-
tralian scene. The party, as bright as a
newly-beaded glass of champagne, lasted
from six to eight last Thursday evening.
Did .you hear the sound of sleigh-bells
through the city last Wednesday? If
your heart was young enough you did.
Santa Claus arrived in dashing style at
the Goulburri-street entrance of Anthony
Hordern’s at half-past one, his magic
sleigh packed with fascinating Walt
Disney characters. In other stores the
small pine-trees, tinsel and glittering
streamers and blithesome paper wrap-
pings on the most modest purchase re-
mind that the season of spending is at
hand. Small plump Cupids (they are
too solid to be heavenly spirits) fly
blithely on such starry firmament as
meteorologist never saw on the paper
wrapping such humdrum, utilitarian
objects as shoes and stockings. If the
income-tax department has sent you the
cheque it has been promising for the
past six months, the set-up makes for
gaiety, but if the taxgathefer still hangs
on to the money he admits owing you,
the gaudy display in the city marts is
just an irritation. . .
The Harry Evans couple (she is pianist
Beatrice Tange) are throwing wide their
friendly home in Wentworth-road,
Vaucluse, on Sunday, December 5. The
party is to honor the leader and members
of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra for
their work throughout the 1948 season.

Second round of the legal contest in the
bank-nationalisation case is scheduled
to begin on March 14 next —the date
fixed by the Privy Council for hearing
of the Commonwealth Governments
appeal against the High Court’s decision
that Section 46 of the Banking Act, 1947,
was invalid. Broadly speaking, a majority
of the High Court held that all the chief
provisions of the Act were invalid. Four
of the six Justices declared that Section
92 of the Constitution, which provides
that “trade, commerce and intercourse
among the States shall be absolutely
free,” invalidated Section 46 of the Act,
which provides for prohibition of private
banking in Australia.
The Government narrowed its request
to the Privy Council for leave to appeal
against the decision in respect of Section
46 only. That was because, in the event
of a decision favorable to it, other de-
fects in the Act could be remedied by
amending legislation. The leave to
appeal, however, has been granted subject
to the right of the respondents (the
trading banks and three States) to submit
again their argument that Section 74 of
the Commonwealth Constitution prevents
the Privy Council from hearing the appeal
without a certificate from the High
Court. So it is possible that the Govern-
ment might yet have to come back to
the High Court for a certificate before
it can proceed with its appeal. Even if
this proves unnecessary, and even if the
Government is successful in its appeal,
amending legislation will be needed to
remedy defects elsewhere in the Act.
The trading banks and three States con-
cerned can certainly be expected to chal-
lenge the validity of amendments to the
Act in the High Court; and it is not im-
possible that there would be grounds for
another appeal to the Privy Council. It is
therefore doubtful whether our present
socialist Government will be in a position
to actually take over the private banks be-
fore next Federal elections, due about
a year hence.
The private banks have meanwhile
adopted a rational, progressive and co-.
operative policy aimed at developing, in
conjunction with the central bank, wider
and better service. Their activities are
already circumscribed by the 1945 Bank-
ing Act, which provides for control of
bank earnings, and therefore distribu-
tions, though no specific limit is placed
on the rate of dividend.
Today the nature of bank assets and
the level of advances and deposits re-
flect the effects of war and post-war in-
flationary influences, which have led to
liquidity in trade and industry and
economy in the use of bank funds. How-
ever, high prices and scarcities are
obscuring many economic and other
dangers. The wise trader, therefore, will
lose no time in underpinning the financial
structure of his undertaking against the
day when the economic machine gets into
reverse gear; and that might not be far
distant, unless crucial bottlenecks are
speedily broken. Foremost among these
are coal, iron and steel, and output per
man-hour throughout the whole ambit of
trade and industry.
Latest figures of the National —now
second-largest and one of the most en-
terprising of the private banks —reflect
absorption of .the Q.N. Bank, details of
which have been given previously in
these columns. Based on the Q.N.’s
figures at end June, 1947, the surplus on
the deal was £893,991. This was added
to reserves, which also benefited by dis-
closure of £806,009 of the National’s
own inner strength. The £528,252 of
profit was £12,962 stronger than com-
bined net earnings of the two institu-
tions at their previous balancing dates.
It was 7.8 p.c. on capital, but only 4.4
p.c. on shareholders’ funds (capital and
reserves combined). Half a point was
added to the div., making it 6i p.c., the
final being at the rate of 7 p.c. p.a.
Balance-sheet figures compare with
combined accounts of the two banks in
1947 as follows;

accompanied by an expansion of
£8,498,704 in advances, of £5,892,311 in
liquids and of £450,000 in premises, etc.
Liquids amounted to 60.7 p.c. of

to only 46.2 p.c. of deposits, etc,
—an exceptionally strong position.

Considering the two-months siege that
the railway strike forced on North
Queensland early this year, Samuel
Allens have turned in a very satisfactory
showing. While its hotels in Cairns were
cut to about two-fifths of their normal
beer supplies, most of the others in its
circuit stretching down to Bowen fared
much worse during the hold-up, and in
each case the loss was irrecoverable. The
blow was likewise felt by the co.’s re-
tailing sections, where an excessive strain
was placed on stocks, and abnormal over-
time pay has since been incurred recover-
ing the leeway.
Despite that dislocation, the year’s turn-
over passed the £2,000,000 mark, setting
a new record. Gross profit as a percent-
age of sales was lower than in 1947, but
still £14,061 higher on an absolute basis.
The gain, however, was swallowed by
bigger labor costs;
1946. 1947. 1948.

In relation to mean capital employed, the
net profit of £43,573 represented 10 p.c.,
against 12 p.c. in 1947—a new issue of
122,500 £1 ords. at 4s. premium was
nearly all taken in during the term.
Samuel Allen’s main interest is still the
hotel-chain —they numbered 26, all free-
holds, in 1932 and the board speaks from
time to time (as last month) of “further
consolidation” —but over the past five
years headway has also been made in
new fields. Besides controlling the
Townsville retail business of Holliman’s,
the co. has regional agencies for Ford
vehicles and a wide range of electrical
lines. It conducts an old-established ship-
ping agency, and recently joined Mount
Isa Mines and others in forming a steve-
doring subsidiary. All sections had a
successful year in spite of the rail trouble,
and the balance-sheet shows that the
stock position has been well repaired—
the net addition over the twelvemonth was
£75,397;
1941. , 1946. 1947. 1948.

Book debts alone absorbed the new
capital issue; they rose £144,822 to con-
stitute one-third of the co.’s assets, and
are entered after a doubtful-debts pro-
vision which appears to be around
£ll,OOO. Fixed assets increased by
£17,478 —partly in remodelling Holliman’s
store—while the board went outside for
an extra £73,237.
Taking note of North Queensland’s
prospering sugar industry, of increasing
British markets for beef, proposed exten-
sions at Mt. Isa and the new Burdekin
irrigation project, the board expresses
confidence in the co.’s trading future.
Proposed renovations to the hotels and
expansion of storage space at Cairns and
Townsville may possibly require more
funds later on. In the current term
turnover has continued to improve, and
some alleviation of price-controls has
been given by the new State authority,
but freight costs on supplies from the
south are still on the way up. A full
year’s 6j p.c, dividend on the new ord.
capital will call for an extra £4600 this
term, which was easily covered by the
last profit.
In addition to 354,644 £1 ords., paid
capital includes 71,428 first prefs. and a
similar number of seconds. Both classes
of pref. are actually preferred ordinaries
with 6 p.c. cumulative rights ; they parti-
cipate fully in dividends beyond that
figure and would rank on the same basis
as the ords. in a wind-up. Rarely seen on
’Change, they are now quoted about
Is. 6d. higher than the ords.; the latter at
265. yield 5 p.c. on the basis of the last
div. Net aSset backing fox each class
of share is 255.

The leap (£95,942) in last term’s profit
was due mainly to a change in the method
of presenting the accounts, which are
now in the form required by the new
English Companies Act —the co. is
registered in London, though the store
is at Sydney, and always has been.
Hitherto profit has been shown after
allowing unspecified amounts for depreci-
ation, taxation and contingencies. Last
term it was written after deducting
specified amounts for depreciation
(£29,402) and taxation (£133,000), but
before providing for contingencies. Of
the £210,844 shown as profit, £75,000
was used to strengthen the stock reserve
(£250,000), and £27,360 was added to
the contingencies reserve (previously
lumped with creditors in the published
accounts), making it £300,000, and
against which “there is no known lia-
bility.” Hence the disclosure of £272,640
of inner reserves.
Treating the addition to stock
reserve as prudent provision against
an unknown but likely contingency,
the year’s net profit was £135,844.
This is not strictly comparable with the
1947 figure, because the addition to con-
tingencies reserve that year is unknown
and a substantial part of the £37,100
written back on account of overprovision
for taxation relates to abolition of War-
time (Co.) Tax. The accounts as now
presented give a broader and fuller pic-
ture of the business, its strength and its
earning power.
The £135,844 of profit covered the
pref. divs. and 23.9 p.c. on the £400,000
of ord. capital as against 18.7, 18, 15.6,
15.1 and 13.1 p.c. back to 1943. The
cautious board kepfr the div. at 10 p.c.,
and, after sending £lO,OOO to the staff
fund, more remained in the business than
was distributed. Including the stock re-
serve, the lay-by was £119,583 in excess
of the million of paid capital when the
books closed. So the two combined need
turn in only 3.7 p.c. to pay pref. divs.
and 10 p.c. to the ords. The £135,844
was 6.4 p.c. on the £2,119,583 of share-
holders’ funds. It all makes the position
of the ords. look encouraging.
Turnover has continued to increase
since the close of accounts, and, with
more goods available, a bumper Christ-
mas trade is in prospect, while the Royal
visit should give a fillip to retail sales
during the June half of 1949. Still,
basically, conditions are beginning to
change; supply is catching up with de-
mand in many lines of consumer goods.
If the level of retail prices rises faster
than the level of wages and salaries, as
seems likely in the not too distant future, ■
the general effect will be to restrict the
range and volume of purchases, thus
rendering part of the present high level
of demand ineffective. More money with-
out more goods would only go on
pushing up prices and upset the whole
economy. Unemployment and loss of
purchasing-power will come not if we
work too much, but if we work too little
and prices and wages keep on rising. At
the moment no one’s purchasing-power
needs a healthy dose of contraction
more than the Government’s.
Alive to the dangers ahead, the man-
agement has set up a reserve of £250,000
against possible price fluctuations in
stocks, especially fashion goods. This
is equal to 20.8 p.c. (4s. 2d. in the £) of
the figure at which stocks are valued for
audit purposes, which is cost or under,
or selling price less provision to reduce
the cost or under. After deducting this
reserve, stocks were £224,175 higher
than at the previous balance:
1939. 1946. 1947. 1948.

The apparent drop of £185,156 in the
amount coming to outsiders was due to
the disclosure of inner reserves, which
also helps to explain most of the increase
of £308,158 in the more-or-less liquid
surplus (£640,985).

Golden Plateau, N.L.
Operating at Gracow (Q.),
this co. put up an encouraging
performance for the year to end
June last. Despite shortage of
labor (average number employed
80 as against 88 for the previous
year), a larger tonnage of better-
grade ore was milled at lower
cost, and more development was
done. Here are treatment, re-
covery and cost figures:

47 .. 23,542 5050 7621 40/9.8
48 .. 27,067 6869 8072 38/0.5
Larger _ tonnage was the main
factor in lowering costs. To-
gether with the improvement in
grade and abolition of Gold
Tax, it all meant a profit of
£21,619 (up £18,516), of which a
6d. div. (same as previous year)
took £21,000, Ore reserves at
June 30 were figured at 91,300
tons, containing 22,5500 z. fine
gold. Developments on lower
levels at the western end of the
mine are encouraging. When
the books closed current assets
totalled £73,746, of which
£44,513 was in Government
paper and cash, etc. There was
only £1905 coming to outsiders.
Paid capital is £113,750 in
3s. 4d. shares, of which 210,000
are f,-p. and balance called to

Cuthbert’s Misima, Misima
Island (Papua), which recently
issued 50,000 new 10s. shares to
test-drill its mineral leases at
depth, has lost no time in getting
to work. Plant and crew are
now on the spot, and actual
drilling will begin as soon as the
site is cleared and plant erected.
The idea is to test-drill the lode
to 1000 ft., and ascertain whether
the oxides persist below present
drainage level (590 ft.) and extent
and probable value of the sul-
phides. The remaining 9s, a
share yet to come on the
contribs. is to be called at the
rate of Is. a share per month

Montana Silver-Lead, N.L.,
. hopes to take a new lease of life.
It has let part of its property at
Zeehan (Tas.) on tribute, to be
worked to a depth of 100 ft., and
is to receive 40 p.c. of the gross
value of all metal won. Formed
in 1937, the co. sank a shaft to
300 ft., and cut levels at 100 ft.
and 200 ft. and a plat at the
300 ft. horizon. Work ceased in
1940, and the plant was bought
by the Federal Government.
Concentrates, sold in U.S., then
fetched £lO 3s. 6d. a ton ; present
price of the metal is about £B5
a ton f.o.b. Zeehan. Co. also
holds 12,000 acres under pros-
pecting licences adjoining the
leases now being tested by B.H.
South and North B.H. These
areas are being geologically

"AIDA."
Grand opera is, really, an
attempt to perform the impos-
sible: to capture in words,
music and color the full weight
of human experience. Wagner,
who, of course, came far nearer
succeeding than Verdi, whose
“Aida” opened the season at
Sydney Tiv,, conceived the form
as a vast meeting-place of all the
arts; greater than painting and
sculpture because the figures
were alive, greater than abstract
music because there was human
passion in the words, greater
than poetic drama because only
music could express the full
depth and intensity of the pas-
sions.
The theory is plausible: the
result, in “Aida” at any rate, is
an amiable hodge-podge: in
which sometimes, as in the
massed effects of pageantry in
gold and red, in the sombre
temple scenes with their glowing
braziers and ugly Egyptian gods
and in the scene on the banks
of the moonlit Nile, there are
living paintings as impressive as
the tinselled art of the stage-
designer can make them; in
which sometimes, as in the love-
song to the celestial Aida or the
celebrated trumpet march, there
are effects which might be said
to transcend the range of
poetry; in which sometimes, as
when Mario Basiola is giving
his very fine interpretation of
the fallen majesty of Ethiopia,
when Germana di Giulio is
showing the difficulties of. de-
ciding between love and patriot-
ism or when Dora Minarchi is
trying in vain to recapture the
love of Radames so that she
may save him from death, there
are moments of moving drama:
but which, on the whole, re-
mains a hodge-podge, slow-mov-
ing, creaking with improba-
bilities, musically and dramati-
cally patehy.
“Aida” is not as insane in its
plofr as are most of Verdi’s
operas, but it is crazy enough.
The final scene, in particular,
falls to pieces. By what miracu-
lous process does Aida creep into
the tomb in which her lover has
been sealed up alive to die? And
if emotional truth —the fidelity
and despair of lovers —is more
important than mere factual
probability, surely the traditional
dividing of the stage into two
sections (the upper showing the
Egyptian princess mourning in
the temple, the lower showing
tKe lovers singing themselves to
death in the tomb) is a mistake.
Nothing of any Importance
happens on the upper section,
and it distracts attention from
the tomb —in which, open to the
audience as it is, the doomed
lovers merely look like hikers
sheltering from the rain in a
cave. Musically and dramati-
cally the opera really ends in
the preceding scene when Am-
neris sends Radames to his
doom.
It is, however, a little too late
to argue with Verdi about all
that. His attempt to perform
the impossible was doomed to
partial failure in any case, be-
cause no opera could really hope
to have more weight than the
poetic drama unless the words
were as good as Shakspeare’s,
and in that case it would merely
mutilate them to sing them.
“Aida” would come closer to
succeeding were there outstand-
ing singers to make the most of
the high moments. Nobody in
the present performance carried
Verdi to very great heights, but
nobody in the entire company
let him down. The production
was smooth, colorful and ad-
mirably balanced.
Kenneth Macqueen.
Kenneth Macqueen’s “Sun-
glint,” a fine sea-piece, i§
wide and deep-blue with a white
shimmer on the crest of the
ocean—a sparkling impression, a
lyric on the warm sun rising over
the morning sea; it is also one
of the few pictures in the exhibi-
tion of Macqueen’s work at
the Grosvenor Gallery, Sydney,
where the artist has not rigidly
followed a pattern.
Other sea-pieces are patterns,
decorations, and bear a curious
resemblance to minute and deli-
cate records of chemical experi-
ments. “Rough Seas” is rigid—
water turned into ice; and
“Water Study,” which has a kind
of agitated mobility, and power,
suggests not so much troubled
waves of saltwater as the precise
waves and eddies made by
chemical gases in a laboratory.
“Foam is frankly a
pattern. And the landscapes,
too, show the deficiencies of
Macqueen’s style.
There are stretches of choco-
late-colored earth, with a pattern
of stubble ; patterns of hills and
trees; and, in several pictures,
skies with clouds floating in
strict line, with precise tips and
uniform tails.
But Macqueen’s style, at least,
is his own. Too many of his
paintings are decorations, and in
a number of them the effect of
the pattern is to produce a re-
markable flatness ; an impression
of artistic triviality. But the
patterns are characteristic of his
work.
And sometimes the patterns
work. “The Banksia,” for
instance, is a beautiful water-
color: a view of the tree look-
ing up from the ground, the
foliage framed in a clear blue
sky and a delicate dappled
pattern on the trunk. “Above the
Weir” is rich and cool, with
spangled patterns in the still
water; “Trees in the Five-Mile
Paddock” and “The Little
Gully” are authentic patterns of
the Queensland countryside in
which one sees first the country,
and then the design, and “Glass-
house Mountains” has breadth
and the isolation of distance.
The last picture was bought by
the N.S.W. National Art Gallery,
with “The Boat Builders,” a
painting of only incidental in-
terest.
Macqueen’s paintings have
delicacy and style, strength and
coldness. The coldness and
rigidity are most noticeable in
the pictures where nature is most
rigidly clamped into a pattern,
and it is likely that when, with-
out deserting his own technique,
Macqueen approaches his
artistic problems less single-
mindedly—when the pattern
loosens into spontaneity—he will
produce his best work.
Art and Climate.
Opening John Perceval’s show
of paintings at the Melbourne
Book Club, novelist Martin
Boyd said that great art had
arisen in countries like Greece
and Italy that were neither too
hot nor too cold. In hot coun-
tries life was too easy and in
cold countries people were too
busy struggling to survive to
make art. As Australia was a
country that was neither too hot
nor too cold, it logically fol-
lowed that great art must be
produced here.
On the day those axioms were
stated the day was too hot for
most people in Melbourne to
think of anything but beer, while
the day before it had been too
cold to think of anything at all.
Two days later the struggle to
survive in Melbourne was in-
tensified by a train, tram and
bus strike.
All those things could serve
as convenient excuses for not
painting by some artists. Dos-
toievsky, however, must have
been pretty cold at times in his
Siberian prison, but he wrote
great literature about it.
At the other end of extremity
of the climatic scale, Mr. Boyd’s
generalisations don’t seem to
apply either. Life in Java is
easier than it is in most places,
and the humidity is excessive,
but native architects and carvers
succeeded in covering the island
with great temple cities and
miles of frescoes. In the
National Gallery in Melbourne
there is a lovely Dancing Siva
which centuries ago was pro-
duced by some Indian sculptor
who somehow or other came
under the influence of Phidias,
or Praxiteles or some other
snoozer.
Mr. Perceval seems to have
come under the influence of
Breughel, at any rate in regard
to subject-matter. He paints
Nativities, Annunciations, Flights
into Egypt and Noah’s Arks, as
well as Melbourne fishmongers,
butchers, cows, sheep, railway
trains, children and nursing
mothers. He has the riotous
imagination of Breughel, and
all he needs is some of the
quality of his observation.
Contrast in Plays.
Christmas offerings at Sydney
Metropolitan are the Coventry
Nativity Play and Edna St.
Vincent Millay’s “Aria da
Capo.” The nativity play, like
all of its kind, moves to a
pleasant tinkle of medieval
rhyme and off-rhyme and, for
all its antique simplicity, has
more of the freshness of true
poetry than Edna St. Vincent
Millay’s highly-polished sophis-
tication.
But “Aria da Capo,” a light
but deadly satire on the folly of
war, in which Pierrot and
Columbine make love while two
artificially elegant Greek shep-
herds build an imaginary wall
and then murder each other for
their property, is also excellent
of its kind. The twp plays, pre-
sumably chosen for their con-
trast of style, illustrate the whole
difference between Greek and
Christian philosophy: for behind
the nativity play is the concept
of divine benevolence, but in
“Aria da Capo” the sinister
Prompter who reminds the
players of their lines when they
forget the terrible cliches that
will lead them to war is inter-
ested only in drama.
Both plays are effectively pro-
duced by May Hollinworth, and,
enlivened by the villainies of the
Prompter and a fiery and furious
Herod, make charming and
strangely restful entertainment.

Thomas Clark , a Scottish doctor, made the
important discovery that hard water can be
softened by chemical means. A common cause
of what is known as temporary hardness is the
presence of dissolved calcium bicarbonate. This
can be removed by boiling, the hardness being
turned into insoluble calcium carbonate —familiar
to most people as the “fur” in kettles. Temporary
hardness not only wastes soap, but is a serious
defect in water used for’industrial purposes. The
“fur” deposited inside boilers and pipes reduces
their efficiency and leads to undue fuel consump-
tion. Clark discovered that the correct quantity
of lime added to temporarily hard water causes
chemical reactions which change both the lime
itself and the unwanted calcium bicarbonate into
an insoluble carbonate. This can be removed,
leaving the water soft, and suitable for use in
steam boilers and for industrial processes.
Clark was born in Ayr in 1801. Thirty years
later he obtained an M.D, at Glasgow University,
but instead of practising medicine he went to
work at the St. Rollox chemical works. In 1833
he was appointed Professor of Chemistry at
Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he remained
until his retirement twenty-seven years later. He
died in 1867. but his memory is perpetuated in
“Clark's method" of water soften-
ing, which is still in use. All users
of water —from the power engineer
to the housewife —owe an incalcul-
able debt to Clark’s investigations.

AND IT'S
Attendance and tote-turnover figures
for the Kirkham Stakes meeting at
Randwick on Saturday showed a
remarkable increase on figures for
the corresponding meeting last year.
Attendance was 33,500 against 25,800
last year, and the tote turnover soared
from £76,100 to £131,700. Ex-
planation lay in the weather, so bad
last year that riders in" the Kirkham
returned to scale carrying as much as
91b. of pluvial overweight.
With the breaking-up of the power-
ful Payten stable, Maurice McCarten
has something of a mortgage on this
year’s trainers’ premiership. Already
he has saddled up twice as many
winners as his closest competitor,
and a very promising bunch of two-
year-olds in his care should enable
him to keep up the good work.
McCarten is the rare instance of a
really top-class jockey meeting with
equal success as a trainer.
Three of the seven races at Rand-
wick on Saturday were for two-year-
olds. With a starter in each, Mc-
Carten collected a first and two
seconds. His three representatiyes —
Chitral, Chartreuse and Vicereine —
are each Victoria-bred and Melbourne-
owned. Chartreuse, a nice stamp
of filly by Helios-Aperitif, and a
winner at her only previous start,
was beaten a length by The Duchess
in the Maltine Stakes for fillies. The
Duchess is a black filly by Le Grand
Due and' gave jockey T. Clarke his
first winner since resuming after a
spell on the outer. Chitral (N. Sell-
wood) started in the Juvenile Stakes
for colts and geldings and ran a
good even race to defeat Field Boy
and Coronation Gift.
The Kirkham disappointingly at-
tracted only five runners—three fillies
and two colts. In their usual
“generous” spirit the bookies had
Pantomime at 2 to 1, Vicereine 9
to 4, Boneith 5 to 2, Rhumba 5 to
1 and Golden Brew (amazingly) 20
to 1. They finished almost in that
order, Golden Brew, however, beat-
ing Rhumba home. Jockey J. Thomp-
son appears to have overcome Pan-
tomime’s aversion to the starting-
stalls; he had her smartly away and
she led throughout, gamely resisting
Vicereine’s challenge over the final
furlong. Time was 1.1.
Provided she does not revert to
barrier roguishness, Pantomime should
continue to win her fair share of
the shorter two-year-old races. By
Ajax from the Gimcrack Stakes-
winner Ajixa, she is bred for speed,
but it would surprise if she developed
any staying ability.
The seven-furlongs Camden Handi-
cap produced a rattling close photo.-
finish, the grey Granite (N. Sell-
wood) winning by a head from The
Groom, with Except a further head
away, third. The Newcastle galloper
Barnsley finished a close fourth and
is worth keeping in mind. With
absolute regularity he is brought to
Sydney to pick up a race round
this time of the year. Last year it
was the Villiers, and, though rising
nine now, he might again be hard
to beat in that race.
The Newmarket-Australian Cup
double is a long way off yet, but,
if asked to attempt a spot of long-
range prophecy present writer would
plump for Phoibos and Bolivia.
Phoibos might seem an obvious
choice; Bolivia, a four-year-old
Harinero horse, hasn’t particularly
impressive form on paper, but he
looks a real stayer. Contesting Satur-
day’s 12-furlongs Warwick November
Handicap, he was dearty enough
beaten by Cape Neddick (J. Thomp-
son), but two miles is more his dis-
tance.
The Farm Encourage Handicap of
12 furlongs went to Lordly (A. Ward),
a three-year-old son of High Caste;
less than a length behind Lordly,
another by High Caste in High Ideals
was third, just shaded by Protect;
The Melfort geldinjg Indarra - (W.
Briscoe) showed improvement on re-
cent ' efforts .by comfortably winning
the mile Welter.

Their ranks visibly reduced by
several weeks of poor results,, punters
who further tempted fate by attend-
ing Caulfield on Saturday had mixed
luck. Three favorites and a second
favorite were successful; other win-
ners started at fancy odds.
At Flemington the previous Satur-
day bookmakers were accused of
cashing in on public sentiment when
they quoted retiring,Harold Badger’s
last mount Dumfries at much shorter
odds than the horse’s recent public
form seemed to warrant. Dumfries
ran nowhere. With D. Barclay up,
in Saturday’s Rosstown Plate (6f.)
Dumfries started at 20 to 1 and
scored well from Our Title and
Denhoti. Perhaps, for once, the
bookies were condemned in error.
Punters had another unpleasant
reminder of the previous week’s rac-
ing when jockey L. Lott on the
33-to-l chance French Pact beat
Brother Sunshine, Bartolus and other
three-year-olds in the mile Pelham
Handicap. At FlemingtoP, Lott,
recently back from India, had won
the Williamstown Cup on Gayness
at similarly long odds.
The track at Caulfield was very
fast. Dumfries cut out six furlongs
in 1.11. The Dhoti filly Jhelum (J.
Purtell), beating Royal Ravine and
Voussoir in the first Stansmore Two-
year-old, covered five furlongs in
60£sec. Following, and eclipsing, that
effort, the Tuhitarata colt Macshaw
(K. Mitchell), favorite for the second
Stansmore, defeated Royal Pharos
and Syrian Sun in 59sec., knocking
a quarter-second off Ajax’s course
record and going within three-parts
of a second of All Love’s Australian
record.
The Eclipse Stakes (12f.) of £2600
(including £lOO for the fourth place-
getter) was an open betting race, with
five of the nine runners pretty well
equally favored. By a shade of the
odds Kongmeng (W. A. Smith) was
favorite at 9 to 2. Shaping well at
previous starts, and fresher than most
of , the Eclipse runners, Kongmeng
won by two lengths from Red Fury,
with Good Idea third and Buonarroti
Boy fourth.
In other Caulfield races, David Star
(G. Godfrey) survived a protest to
beat Priority and Adjudicator in the
Tara Steeple, and Law Case (P.
Riley), showing that he has some
stamina as well as speed, won the
nine-furlongs Ormond Handicap.

The English racing season concluded
on Saturday and saw the evergreen
Gordon Richards win his 21st riding
premiership; he landed over 200
winners. Next on the list was Edgar
Britt with 145 winners; Britt, and
his fellow-Australian Togo Johnstone,
between them wpn nearly all the
major races, the Derby continuing to
elude Richards.

An accusation sometimes levelled
at Australians is that they are more
fond of watching than participating
in sport. As the relevant governing
bodies would ruefully agree, one sport
to which this certainly does not
apply is tennis. Open as it is equally
to both sexes, tennis is almost cer-
tainly played by more Australians
than any other sport; yet top-class
tennis here, and that is top-class
tennis by world standards, attracts
fewer spectators than any of the
major sports,
A visit to White City (N.S.W.),
where the N.S.W.' championships are
at present being played, makes this
difficult to understand. Facilities are
tip-top and there’s fine tennis to be
seen. On Saturday were played the
finals which were abandoned due to
rain last year. Beating Miss Toomey,
6-2, 6-1, Mrs. Bolton won the ladies
singles title for the sixth time. In
the current championships, which con-
tinue up to next Saturday, Mrs.
Bolton will strike a bit of unfamiliar
opposition in the American girl,
Doris Hart. The men’s doubles,
abandoned last year with the score
two sets all, was won comfortably
on the replay by the old firm of
Bromwich-Quist, beating Long-Sidwell
2-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4. Bromwich is play-
ing vastly-improved tennis; so, too,
is another Wimbledon finalist, Geoff
Brown.

The Lakes Club (Sydney) will hold

George Berwick, of N.SIW. —one
of Australia’s great cricket umpires—
has called it a day. He had his
baptism in Test cricket in the tur-
bulent 1932-33 season; when he and
G. A. Hele weathered the gale of
abuse during the Larwood-Jardine
bodyline rumpus. Berwick has stood
through rain and heat-waves in all
branches of first-class cricket, the
last being with Jack Scott in the
1946-47 Test series v. England.

After defeating Queensland by an
innings and 240 runs at Brisbane
N-S.W. Colts struck a snag on the
way home in slow bowler Fofbes,
of North Coast XI, who gathered
five wickets for 15 runs. The ’Coasters
scored 201 and 84 for four wickets;
“ Doesn’t the vasiness of the ocean make one feel
small, Bertha ?”
Colts 137 and 30 for one wicket.
Their excellent showing in the Bris-
bane fixture earned J. Burke and
A. Walker a place in the N.S.W. team
for the Sheffield Shield opening v.
Queensland on Friday. Morris cap-
tains the side and will have the help
of Lindwall, Miller and Saggers.

The Kangaroo League team had
improved luck in England last week.
After being licked 10-7 by Worthing-
ton, they took revenge on Swinton,
beaten 21-0 —the first time during
the tour that either side has won
to nil. On Saturday the tourists
outplayed a Wales XIII by 12-5, im-
proving their progressive score, which
stands at 12 wins against njne losses.

There was a surprisingly well-
attended miniature regatta on the
Parramatta (N.S.W.) on Saturday
when Evans Paddon and Max Fisher
contested the world professional scull- ■
ing title relinquished by Bobby Pearce.
Belying the belief that pro. sculling
is a dead sport here, a great gathering
thronged the foreshores and a host
of small craft lined the waterway.
As predicted here, Fisher proved much
nippier round the buoys but Paddon
had the advantage of youth and
strength as well as more polished
oarsmanship and outstayed his
opponent. Hailing from the Rich-
mond River district of N.S.W., Pad-
don is a son of the former title-
holder Jim Paddon.

Sydney Town Hall has seen its fair
share of beefy tenors wrestling with
the chromatic scale. Last week the
venerable chamber was treated, by
way of a change, to the spectacle of
equally beefy muscle-men wrestling
with gravity—gravity made tangible in
the shape of iron bars with massive
weights at both ends. In short, a
gathering of weight-lifting enthusiasts
for the Australian Amateur Cham-
pionships. The most muscular effort
of the show was put up by Olympic
rep. R. McGee (N.S.W.), who shifted
8001 b. to take the heavyweight title.

At Leichhardt Mahomet Donnelly
(9.12£) took only four and a half
rounds to demonstrate that he carried

awarded a t.k.o. decision.

At Melbourne Stadium on Saturday
Sydneysider Ken Bailey (9.9 f) de-
feated the best of the local light-
weights, Norm Gent (10.1), in a
disappointingly dull scrap. Palpably
overweight, Gent landed occasional
light taps in the early rounds and
caused Bailey to miss frequently, but
over the final rounds he was too tired
to do anything but defend himself.

Still a Conflict
In spite of high export prices
for Australian produce, a grim
fight still has to go on in in-
dustry for the purpose of estab-
lishing a sounder basis for our
economic future. Gradually
battle with the Communist-
controlled trade-unions is being
joined by- volunteers (and near-
conscripts) one would have
hardly counted upon 12 months
ago, and, although a decisive
conflict may bring the sharpest
single knock to production we
have yet seen, a victory should
be followed by something more
like industrial stability than we
have experienced for five years
at least.
At present, however, produc-
tion is still being strangled by
trade-union misbehavior, even
though the A.W.U. is doing
something for real Australian
unionism in its fight against the
Communists. Building materials
are still extremely difficult to
get, notwithstanding the fact that
those engaged in homebuilding
are slower in their work than
they used to be—in other words,
a carpenter or a bricklayer does
not handle nearly as' much
timber or bricks in a year as he
would have done in 1939. It
would appear that the chief
bottleneck in homebuilding is on
the materials side, since builders
with a team of men ready to
work often have to scrounge for
bricks, tiles, cypress pine, steel,
guttering or piping. It is in the
building industry as a whole that
perhaps the worst shortages
exist—in which the results of
most other raw-material and
transport shortages show up to
the worst advantage.
Under the calculated obstruc-
tionism of the Communist-
dominated unions and the opera-
tion of the 40-hour week, costs
continue to rise in Australia,
and this trend has been accele-
rated by the abandonment of
Federal price-subsidies. Cost-
of-living rises in the basic wage
are followed by more rises in
the cost of living; and a very
nasty economic cycle is now in
progress. It can be best checked
by an increase in production per
man per hour, but such a remedy
is, of course, discouraged at all
costs by the exponents of the
“cold war” now in our midst —
the Communists.
Communists and Socialists
have long ranted about the
“financial system.” They have
certainly entangled themselves in
the financial workings of this
country to a most influential
degree. The world of finance
and industry today, deranged as
it has been by the impact of a
colossal war, at present finds
international politics, especially
the Soviet brand, the most
obvious disrupting factor.
In Australia the class preju-
dices of Mr. Chifley, Mr. Cal-
well and the like have, wittingly
or unwittingly, helped the Com-
munists in their attack upon
Australian industrial and social
conditions, and “Labor’s” social-
isation programme has played
into the Communists’ hands
also. Heavy Commonwealth
taxation has restricted private
industrial initiative, and price-
control has been a similar
hindrance—however necessary it
may have been during the war,
there has been no justification
for price-control as an agency
of socialisation.
With “employment” at a high
figure regardless of production,
the amount of money in circu-
lation continues to grow in Aus-
tralia, but it appears that in-
creasing living costs are taking
away the money from those re-
ceiving it a pace faster than seen
at any time since the war began.
Those in receipt of the higher
wages and enjoying the 40-hour
week seem to be very little, if
any, better off than they were
a couple of years ago, when the
aftermath of war was more
evident. Their rate of spending
is drawing much closer to their
rate of earning, and the steady
savings of the war period are
no longer obvious among wage-
earners. The growth in savings-
bank deposits has slowed down
perceptibly over the last couple
of years.
There has been some talk in
political circles about the in-
crease in the earnings of public
companies. These, in fact, in no
way measure up to the levels of
the pre-war period when buying-
power of money is taken into
account. If the shareholder was
receiving a fair thing, on the
average, in 1939, and had been
compensated for rising living
costs as the wage-earner has
been, his profits and dividends
would be far higher than they
are today.
The sharemarket remains firm
because of the inflation in values
generally and because Australia,
given by its working population
and political parties anything
like a fair industrial chance,
would have the ball at its feet.
Colonial Sugar
Colonial Sugar’s g.m. is the
latest to point to the present in-
adequacy of the statutory de-
preciation allowance when re-
garded as a replacement reserve.
In his half-yearly message to
shareholders Mr. Rothe describes
“the question of providing funds
for the replacement of plant” as
one of industry’s greatest prob-
lems :
You should know that the amounts
that have been allocated, from year
to year, to the replacement and de-
preciation funds (at not less than
the rate allowed by the income-tax
authorities) have, particularly since
1939, been insufficient to replace plant
that required renewing. In this con-
nection, we would bring to your
notice the fact that the Taxation
Departments only allow depreciation
based on original cost, not on re-
placement cost.
The accounting procedure adopted
by your directors in regard to the
replacement of plant is to increase
the fixed asset accounts by the
excess of the cost of renewals over
the original cost. The book-values
of such assets thus increase not only
by the cost of extensions and im-
provements but also by excess costs
of renewals.
The report doesn’t indicate that
there will be any modification of
that accounting procedure—the
system of declaring profits could
be affected if there wereI—nor 1 —nor
that there is an imminent need
for extra capital to meet re-
newals. Indeed, the delay in
securing replacements seems to
be no less serious than their
cost; steel is urgently needed for
the maintenance of plant and
rolling-stock, but orders have
been outstanding since June,
1946. When C.S.R.’s books
were ruled off last March a re-
placement reserve of £6,823,000
appeared against fixed assets of
£14,459,000, Cash balances had
been reduced in the preceding
twelvemonth from £1,944,000 to
£535,000, paying for additional
plant and stocks of sugar.
Storage threatens to be a
greater headache than ever this
season. With a carryover of
270.000 tons of raw sugar await-
ing shipment in Queensland, the
new crop is now expected to be
910.000 tons, or 14 p.c. above
earlier estimates. In N.Q. ports
waterside - handling has im-
proved only “very slightly and
belatedly,” while there is grow-
ing congestion in the south. The
favorable season presents
C.S.R.’s mills and refineries with
a formidable challenge— at pre-
sent they are working at 80 p.c.
capacity because of inferior coal
and shortage of labor —but the
sharemarket’s confidence is ex-
pressed in the price of £6l for
the £2O scrip, compared with
£59 12s. in June.
Last year Mr. Chifley drew
an all-time record tax levy from
the people and spent at a record
peace-time rate. In any year in
which he has made taxation
“concessions” he has belied his
own forecasts by collecting a
“You re not fair; I've had to work hack three nights
this Week!"
higher tax revenue by the time
the year has closed. At the pre-
sent time his handling of the
nation’s money is on a really
colossal scale. He has achieved,
to a large extent, socialisation
through taxation and “controls.”
He realises that by his heavy
taxation he is restricting s pri-
vate initiative, strengthening his
power to buy votes from those
in the lower-tax brackets and
those on the Government pay-
roll at election time. Thus he
is extremely loath to reduce tax
rates to somewhere near their
pre-war level —that is even if we
concede the social-security levy
to be in a class of its own.

In 1938 Britain’s “invisible
exports” totalled £405 million,
“invisible imports” £173 million,
credit balance being £232 mil-
lion. In 1948, if the final six
months of this year show the
same results as the first, “in-
visible exports” will total £494
million, “imports” £462 million.
credit balance £32 million,
British shipping earnings are
rising, but earnings from over-
seas investments have fallen
because of sales of stocks
before lend-lease began to
operate. Costs of Govern-
ment services overseas have
risen steeply, and so has net in-
terest on external debts. But the
all-over balance of British ♦pay-
ments is improving, and, is prov-
ing one of the more cheering
aspects of the Old Country’s
battle for rehabilitation.

The DOCTOR AT LLOYD'S
Although most of the customs and traditions associated
with the early history of Lloyd’s of London have survived
until the present time, there is one notable exception
the “Doctors” at Lloyd’s.
They were a special coterie of Underwriter-Broker, sought
after by their colleagues for re-insurance against a risx
becoming a total loss, such as when a vessel had become
a casualty or was considered overdue, as well as unusual
risks carrying heavy liabilities. However, withadvent
of steam and modern, fast means of communication with
the corresponding reduction in risks, they are fast becoming
a class that to-day is almost extinct.
This little thumb-nail sketch which, we hope, will be of
interest to you, is one of a series of personalities who were
prominent in the early days of historic Lloyd’s of London.

Maoriland Liquor Trade
Long-awaited liquor-trade re-
forms proposed in N.Z. were
like a shot in the arm to brewery
shares, not because of what the
Government planned to do but
because it shied well clear of the
Licepsing Commission’s main
recommendation, made in 1946,
to put an end to “tied houses.”
After sleeping on the commis-
sion’s report for a couple of
years. Government reformers
decided to nothing to do
with divorcing hotels from
breweries, so brewery cos. are
able to breathe freely again.
Temperance leaders immediately
seized on this as the big weak-
ness in the bill, and showed
fight as the Government pre-
pared to push the proposals
through before the House ad-
journed for Christmas. But
while the reforms were exposed
to crossfire the general public
seemed fairly well satisfied with
the promised changes, especially
the prospect of having the final
voice of extending bar hours be-
yond 6 p.m. when the issue is
put to voters by referendum
early next year.
Well over half of Maoriland’s
hotels are “tied.” The Commis-
sion put the figure at 749 in a
total of 1098. This left 349
“free” houses. In the main group
were 202 hotels owned or con-
trolled by M.L.’s big noise in the
trade, N.Z, Breweries, Ltd.,
whose lusty young rival,
Dominion Breweries, Ltd., held
the reins over a shade under a
third as many. Both leading cos.
have been keen to extend their
hotel interests, A lot of the shafts
levelled at them on the score of
M.L.’s overcrowded hotels are
aimed at the wrong target; they
should be directed at the Gov-
ernment, which has held up
operations for years by its build-
ing ban. There’s no sign that
early relief is ahead to help
M. win favor with tourists, so
the outlook for visitors during
the Royal tour next February
and March seems bleak.
A reshuffle of hotel licences
should help fast-growing towns
and cities to get some of the
trade that has lagged behind the
tide of population in old min*
ing towns once prosperous but
today nearly dead. Also, 25
new licences will be handed out,
to be followed by five more for
every rise of 50,000 in the num-
ber of Maorilanders. Still in
generous mood, the Government
will manufacture a new type of
licence for tourist resorts, to a
total of 25, and for public-works
camps. Nor will social and
sports clubs be forgotten, for the
odds are that scores will be
licensed under the new set-up.
N. Forest Products
Enterprises of “great pith and
moment” in Maoriland’s forestry
world were big talking points for
chairman David Henry at the
annual meeting of N.Z. Forest
Products, Ltd., in Auckland, in
mid-November. This co. has
been getting into the news a
good deal with its plans and
prospects, but as for shareholders
—there are 45,000 of them in
Australia looking for divs.,
they’ll have to hang on
for a while yet. The co. has had
a hard uphill grind, but the day
seems to be near when trees
from its 175,000 acres of forests
will begin to feed a growing
chain of mills. Production in the
past year has moved in the right
direction, and the 20-year con-
tract clinched with Australian
Newsprint Mills, Ltd., to supply
12,500 tons of pulp annually, will
give a further lift.
Tree-felling will be speeded
up, production costs will be cut
and the co.’s plant should begin
to purr more sweetly. Henry has
high hopes that the road ahead
will lead to big exports to Aus-
tralian and other markets, which
have been drawing timber pro-
ducts from outside sterling
boundaries. Three aspects of the
co.’s present programme, as he
sees them, are: (1) Development
of existing industries to build up
support for new projects to be
launched; (2) expenditure of
funds to establish new industries
for which finance 5 has been
arranged; and (3) raising of
further finance when required
for the co.’s planned paper-mill
and corrugated-container plant.
Government support by con-
structing rail facilities and sup-
plying electric power is counted
on to help bring results.
To original shareholders,
Henry gives a reminder that they
didn’t subscribe any portion of
their investment for manufactur-
ing plant, but wholly for plant-
ing and maintaining the forests,
so the co. had to seek other
finance to turn the trees into
money. Early this year Mel-
bourne underwriters backed 4%
p.c, debentures for £li million.


ABORIGINALITIIES
In contrast to groper-
grabbers (B. 3/11 /’4B), we cod-fishermen
never skite about the ones we land, ex-
cept when they are really big. I would
not mention about the one I hooked but
for the unusual circumstances that
attended his taking. I got him on a set
line in a big hole a few miles below
Burrinjuck. After a lot of hauling, in
which I nearly blew a couple of valves
in the old ticker, I managed to get him
on to the shingle at the end of the hole
and was examining my prize, noting
with curiosity a big brown patch about
a foot wide on his back, which ran prac-
tically the length of his dorsal, when a
long hairy cove came loping round the
bend. Ignoring me, he grabbed the top-
rail of a near-by fence and started lever-
ing the cod back into the water. As the
fish would obviously be far too coarse to
eat, I grabbed the bottom rail and lent
a hand. As we got him afloat the hairy
gent, unbent sufficiently to tell me that
the fish was a pet and that ffe’d been
feeding him for years. Questioned as to
the brown patch, he said that since the
erection of Burrinjuck dam the Commis-
sion was so lousy with its water that the
hole was barely deep enough, with the
result that each summer the cod suffered
severe sunburn. He added that during the
’45 drought he’d spent many a weary day
and sleepless night poling him off shoals
and snags. Keeping the big cod in rabbits
had developed into a full-time job for him.
I left him, an ardent supporter of the
present State Government in its efforts
to have the Snowy River diverted into the
’Bidgee, for, as the old cove remarked, in
a few years’ time the fish would prob-
ably have his head permanently out of
water, and he supposed he’d have to get
his sister in Adelaide to make the un-
fortunate fish a hat for use in the summer.

and half-blinded by needle-glint, in an
evil moment 1 “pointed the bone” at
Choom’s shade-producer, and almost
immediately into the paddock waltzed
merrily a willy-willy. For a while the
whirling air-current ‘ played wide of
Choom, then suddenly it swooped updn
him. The circle of tarred paper went
skittering and tumbling across the sky,
and soon it looked like a lone starling
winging over the far ridges. “Y’ saved
the handle, anyhow,” yelled the boss.
Despite the din of tractor and header I
got the gist of what Choom replied. That

“Curaie’s Lgg': Inc Booraxa, Bore
murder in the Hungerford (W.Q.) dis-
trict some eight years ago demonstrated
the superiority of mulga wood to the
highest octane spirit in the elimination
of a corpse (B. 27/10/ ’4B). Mahoney
and Bischoff, of Brisbane C. 1.8., toiled
in the shimmering heat to rig and insert
a sand-pump down a newly-sunk bore-
shaft. This apparatus siphoned up a
quantity of sand tinged with finely-
powdered charcoal. The mixture was
sieved to disclose a pair of buckles from
a suit of overalls. These were sufficient
to convict the murderer, who admitted
that he had placed the deceased’s body
on a pyre of mulga, the fiercest-burning
of all bush fuels, which had reduced the
remains to fine powder.

“Herbert Dawson”: “Zake” (B.
22/9/’4B) misunderstands that most mis-
understood of animals the bull when he
refers to the “incensed sire.” Although
the old lad is all on for stoushing any
rival which may exhibit inclination for
dalliance with the blondes or brunettes
of the mob, the bull’s hostility is caused
only by the threat to his harem rights,
never by any threat to his offspring.
Dingoes can kill calves right under his
nose, or cattle-dogs heel-up his cows,
without stirring anything in his bovine
breast. To depict him as a protector in
any sense outside the lists of love is to
place him entirely out of character.

“Drover”: Had “Lower Tops’!” turned
north from the eastern end of his Prince’s
Highway and toured into the few
thousand or so square miles of Alps be-
tween the coast and the border he’d have
struck country where the nag is not a
back number (B. 27/10/’4B). Over track-
less runs, where startled Herefords crash
through the undergrowth and disappear
again when scarcely sighted, the old
saddle and pack still dig their toes in on
slopes that laugh at man’s machines.
Some day, perhaps, science will invade
the area. Imagine it —camped, on black
nights, 100 miles, from nowhere, in one
of those deep virgin gullies, with nothing
to talk to but a machine! The ’roos,
dingoes, emus and the eagles will be
spoon-fed and commercialised. Then the
nags will be really gone; and so, thank
God, will this bushman,

“Gravelsnatcher”; Let “M ouj i k”
adhere to his theories anent Baalbek’s
origin (B. 6/10/’4B), but let him not dis-
parage my “bearded shepherd on the
Bekaa Plain.” That man was real, and
earnest albeit mildly intolerant of the in-
explicable urge that kept me for ever on
the move in some way or another. For
him there was work to be done, or there
wasn’t; and when there wasn’t he em-
ployed, to the fullest degree, the ability,
inherited from a wiser age, to relax in
complete rest. But think not that he slept
while he rested. From where he lay, with
his flock in view, he could look down
upon the city with its ancient ruins.
Farther off, on the other side of the
narrow plains, the snow-covered moun-
tains rose in exaggerated splendor. Peace
reigned. In such surroundings a man
could think who would—think of kings
and conquering armies and slaves and the
inevitable end of glory. That man could
think, and his mind, uncluttered with use-
less learning, was. superior to mine. I
spoke of Australia, the land of great open
spaces, and a smile woke in the eyes of a
man who knew the desert routes to
Afghanistan. I mentioned modern
engineering, and shopped as he glanced
idly to where a 1000-ton bearer sat
atop the temple’s ancient pillars. I praised
the speed of modern travel, and in a
twinkling I was with him in a market-
place 2000 miles away. His knowledge of
ancient history may have been faulty—l
wouldn’t know. But, bearded and dirty,
unkempt and ragged, he was the envied
one of the two men who looked on Baal-
bek’s ruins, where once there dwelt a
king.
“THEY'RE easy; but have a go at this one.”
“B. A. Ker”: Well, well, so “Pongo”
wants to know who told me that jarrah
is one of our hardest hardwoods (B.
3/11/’48)! The answer is: that greatest
of all teachers —experience. But if
theoretical confirmation is needed Sydney
Technical College (Building Trades Sec-
tion) will supply it. Certainly there are
harder timbers grown in Australia. Mulga
is one —and it is more fitting than gidyea
to head “P.’s” list as the hardest of all
hardwoods. Lack of girth restricts it to
being the ideal medium for ornamental
woodturning. But, remember, I was talk-
ing of hardwood as used in the building
trade; that includes bluegum, stringy-
bark, spotted-gum—in fact, all the
eucalypts ; and very few are harder than
jarrah. As regards “Pongo’s” boast that
he will “drive a 6in. nail through a 2in.
jarrah plank with one belt,” several
aspects must be taken into consideration.
Firstly, a 6in. nail, gauge four, would be
less likely to bend when driving than,
say, a 3in. 12-gauge (and “Gravelsnatcher”
would hardly have been using 6in. spikes).
Secondly, the amount of sap in the plank
would play an important part. Thirdly,
as “P.” says, “there’s an art in nail-
driving,” but as he confesses to being a
master with a 26-ounce hammer he can
probably do it —with a pen.

“The Pirate”; The best place I’ve
struck for oysters inside the Great Barrier
Reef is the rugged, uninhabited Flinders
Group of islands, 110 miles to the north
of Cooktown. At Blackwood Island
there it is just a question of knocking
the bivalves off rocks at low water and
tossing them in a dinghy. A year or so
back at the rocky mountain-like isle we
found a party of abos. —whole families,
they had canoed over from the drab
shores of Princess Charlotte Bay—and
neither our efforts nor theirs made any
appreciable difference to the supplies.
Those boongs gorged themselves on
oysters roasted on coals in the half-shell.
* * * *
“Lower Tops’l”: According to a West-
ralian fisheries inspector, salmon trout
run a community hospital of their own.
On the Twelve-Mile Beach near Hope-
toun, 300 miles south-east of Perth, is a
lagoon which is divided into two com-
partments known to local fishermen as
“the hospital” and “the morgue.” In
the former the slightly-wounded salmon
—those with sides torn and tails bitten
off by sharks, seals or porpoises—are
observed resting; in “the morgue” the
more seriously-maimed fish segregate
themselves.
* * * *
“Solitude”: Came in to find Seventy-
fiver busily arming himself with a bucket
of water and an ancient horse-brush.
“Coin’ t’ clean the winder,” he an-
nounced sheepishly. “What for?” “Aw,
well, Sol,” he parried. “It’ll soon be
cornin’ on Christmas, an’ .. . an’ .. . well,
what does anybody clean a winder for?
“Besides,” he added, “Blue’ll be able t’
come in an’ out in the night.” “What’s
jwrong with him coming through the hole
near the fireplace, like he always does?”
Fhe old bloke scowled. “Aw, well, it’ll
let more air in, won’t it?” he challenged,
scrubbing valiantly at the grease that had
got itself on the glass last season,
“In !” X glared round the hut. “Cnpes,
if y’d nail some of the bark back on,
here ’n’ there, and” “Well, I was
readin’ in the paper,” he bawled, baited
at last to his real reason, “that it am t
hy-hygien . . , it ain’t ealthy t’ sleep with
the winder shut. I bin gettin’ rheumatics
lately, an’ I bet it’s that flamin’ winder
doin’ it.” I gave up; and that night a
couple more square feet of gale kept
everything fluttering back and forth across
the hut floor. Maybe it was the rattle that
prevented the old bloke’s hearing Brown’s
foal as she nickered to him for a hunk
of bread. All she could reach through
the new opening was his best- whiplash,
which, excusably enough, she mistook for
a crust of Doughy’s creation. Even the
old bloke doesn’t blame her for the mis-
take, but he becomes violent about the
necessity of a law to prevent newspapers
printing destructive advice.
* * * ♦
“Chemicus”; “Salmon Gums” (B.
6/10/.’48) errs in describing sulphur
dioxide as inflammable; but carbon bi-
sulphide (the substance which he used) is,
and, furthermore, the vapor of the latter
forms an explosive mixture with air.
Sulphur dioxide is normally a gas; car-
bon bisulphide - a volatile liquid. When
carbon bisulphide burns carbon dioxide
and sulphur dioxide are formed.

“Blime”: Henry might have got away
with his drought-area physique if he’d
dressed his mug with a less meek and
innocent expression. His second morning
at the woolshed, he was climbing into his
greasies 10 minutes before the bell, when
big Darby spotted him. “Listen t’ the
wrestling last night, Henry?” he inquired,
blandly. “Bloke got all tied up in the
fourth round. Good hold, too. I’ll show
y’,” The mob gathered, grinning eagerly,
as Darby grabbed the newchum and
twisted him to a helpless position. “Aw,
that wasn’t it, Darb,” Joe broke in.
“More like this.” One after the other the
blokes illustrated their ideas of the hold
on Henry, till interrupted by the arrival
of the boss. Next morning it was a mob
argument on the best way to throw a
calf, Henry very unwillingly filling the
role of bovine. After that came a mis-
laid bale-hook, and, eyeing the little
bloke’s curved beak, Plugger didn’t see
why Henry wouldn’t make a darned good
bale-hook. The substitute was bawling
loudly when the unsuccessful operations
were again stopped by the boss’s arrival.
A week later the boss turned from ring-
ing the bell to scowl as Henry dashed in.
“What, again? Dunno why you scrape
in on the bell every mornin’ lately,” he
grumbled. “You get y’self up a bit
earlier, me lad, an’ arrive here with the
others! ”

“Nor’-west”: That Gippslander who
ingeniously traps eels by means of old
motor tyres (B. 27/10/’4B) is merely
modernising ancient Australian bush
practice. Lacking fish-hooks and -nets,
Binghi practised the ancient art by means
of a hollow log. Selecting a length of,
say, 6ft. he stuffed one end with bark
or grass, then by means of stones sank
the log in moderate shallows. The
modus was to approach in the morning,
stuff the open end with another plug of
bark, then, after draining out the water,
carry the log ashore. There wojjuld always
be something in it —eels, fish, or even, in
season, freshwater crays. Incidentally,
although Binghi might half-cook his fish
or eel in the ashes, he always took his
crustaceans neat, sucking them out of
the shell like the white does his oysters.
I, THE PEKINESE.
I have not the greyhound’s peerless speed
Nor the bulldog’s truculent swagger,
But I’m pleased to be known wherever I go
As a friendly and gay tail-wagger.
Not overmuch given to roaming am I,
And when through the night comes the
murmur
Of waves on wide beaches, I crouch at the feet
Of my mistresses, Ellen and Irma.
My forebears, I’m told, were cherished of old
By mandarins, poets and scholars,
And queens, almond-eyed, brushed and per-
fumed their coats
And graced them with jade-jewelled collars.
I help in the garden when Irma toils there
And while she delves here, and there hoses,
Odd trifles I bury, shoes, bones and the like,
That never spring up like her roses.
And proud am I, proud as Alsatian and Dane
As, leaving the suburb we dwell in,
We three wander down for a romp on the
beach —
The Pekinese, Irma and Ellen.

“Hanko”: We went to neighbor
Chard’s clearing sale for —er—senti-
mental reasons. There was free luncheon
and liquid refreshment; oceans of beer
and harder stuff, too, if you knew your
way to the cellar. “A man’ll hafta buy
somethingsh,” the boss said, tripping over
a fender and putting a boot through a
Japanese fire-screen. “A man’ll hafta”
He sought hardily to recapture his
train of thought. “A man’ll hafta havva
drinksh,” he finished. When next I met
him he was cuddling a picture of “The
Stag at Bay.” We got home somehow,
with a quart of whisky the trunip
had frisked when everyone was bat-eyed.
Three days later we found the stag,
with a gaping hole in a part of his struc-
ture, down by the lambing paddock
“Cripes,” the boss gasped. “The dawgs
got him, all right; they’ve tore the hind-
quarters orf of the poor cow.” It was
the first time I’d laughed since we’d
finished the quart of whisky.

“Billy T.”; When Mat and his Boswell
humped their knots along that Western-
port Road towards Warragul (B.
10/11 / ’4B) they probably stopped for a
smoke at the Lang Lang River bridge at
the foot of Heath Hill. Years ago, before
the railway went through, that was our
destination every Anniversary Day, to
gather the year’s supply for Mum’s black-
berry jam. From the land side the
brambles would have stopped an army
of commando goats, but you could get
into the brown water with your kero.-tin
and strip the long heavy clusters of inky
fruit straight into the bucket. To sustain
the family through this arduous opera-
tion there was the customary Gippsland
snack of meat pies, egg-and-bacon pies,
cheese-and-onion pasties, apple pies, cus-
tard tarts, buns, sponge- and fruit-cakes,
all of which we nippers stowed with ease
on a deep foundation of blackberries laid
and maintained during picking. As the
tins filled during mid-afternoon there was
time for a stroll up the river to where a
great mulberry-tree stood in an old de-
serted orchard, and a bucket of the longer
berries allowed further culinary variety;
then back for a yarn with the old chap
who lived in a neat hut just above the
bridge. His garden was of the richest
river flat, and he grew taters, dahlias and
French beans to perfection. But the high-
light of that outing was the honey-mead,
for at that season Dad was just recovering
from his annual lacing from our few hives,
and, the honey having ceased to drip from
the chaffbag in which the comb had been
suspended, the residue was boiled with
hops and grain for a big batch of mead
instead of the usual hop-beer. Nothing
ever united our family so completely as
that mild, mellow liquor. We helped each
other over logs, lit the fire, passed the
scran, swapped jobs, held barbed-wires up
or down, took old Nell down to water and
harnessed her up again, all without being
told; we worked and laughed all the
afternoon and laughed and sang on the
long drive home. Must dig up that recipe
and send it overseas. It would be just
the thing for Molotov.

“Old-timer”: Sudden heat and a dry
westerly hayed-off Mac’s oats and he
put the binder in. He was blithely
coming up the fourth turn .when he
sighted Toohey racing towards him,
waving his arms and yelling. Mac stared
at Toohey and then saw Crosscut Benson
racing in on a tangent. A noise caused
“Clock shlopped .”
him to look back and he saw flames
eating up the hay behind him. He threw
the binder out of gear and speeded the
tractor straight through the wire fence
on to the safe fallow, where he stopped the
engine, then left the machine and raced
to the house. Meantime, afoot, ahorse,
atruck and acar, the district arrived and
hopped into that fire. After a wild half-
hour of flailing and sweating in the chok-
ing smoke and heat, with smarting eyes
and scorched arms, they beat it out,
though Mac lost 40 acres of oats, a hay-
stack and a set of old spring-cart wheels.
Blowing and grinning at each other’s
blackened faces, they looked round for
Mac. Unruffled, unblackened, calm, he
hailed them from his verandah. “Come
up here, boys!” On the verandah stood
a sgal. keg covered with wet bags, sur-
rounded by waiting cups and pannikins.
“Ran down an’ got her ready soon’s
I seen y’,” Mac confided happily to
Toohey. “Knew there’d be enough of
y’t’ put her out without me, so reckoned
I better get the keg out. Thought she’d
come in handy,” he ended, moving to
drive the bung in. They were too grateful
for comment, but Mac has been warned
never to have another fire unless he’s
dead sure there’s a keg ready.
* * * *
“Biggest Mac”: Ted Braddock, his
missus and eldest son had just come back
from a trip to Adelaide. The station-
master asked him how they’d got on.
“Well, Jim, Mum reckons there was
always a smell about; but she liked the
shops. Bruce? He couldn’t keep his
eyes off the tabbies.” Remaining silent
on his own reactions, Ted had to be
prompted. “Well —them trottin’ horses
got me,” he said, “They’re better-lookin’
an’ go faster than what my mare does. If
I knew where they got them oats I’d get
some sent up for her!”
* * * *
“Aitchel”; Can’t say I have seen the
illustration mentioned by “Herbert Daw-
son” (B. 10/11 / ’4B) depicjting an old
red kangaroo standing on his toes with
his tail curled in between his legs. But
in the Nicholson-street entrance to the
Exhibition Building, Melbourne, there is
a drinking-fountain surmounted by two
sculptured kangaroos supporting a lamp
or something. The kangaroos are
squatting on their hind-legs facing each
other, and each has his tail curled in
between his legs. Horrors!
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: That bob-tailed
goanna I mentioned, and to which
“Hanko” refers (B. 20/10/’4B), is a
sleepy, slow-moving reptile who must
have few natural enemies, otherwise his
species would have ceased to exist aeons
ago. Hfe appears never to emerge com-
pletely from his winter sleep, and in the
spring he moves serenely towards a
sticky end beneath the wheels of any
vehicle in sight. For his living he de-
pends on the fact that he’s one degree
faster than an egg, which he usually
overhauls after an exciting chase, and his
presence in rabbit-burrows suggests that
he sometimes traps a baby bunny in a
dead-end. Without any offensive orna-
ment, he’ll tackle anything that molests
him, and his bluff usually works. He
can bite, of course, and Westralian bush
kids perpetuate a pretty little fallacy that
his teeth leave a wound that never com-
pletely heals, breaking out afresh each
year on the anniversary of the day it was
inflicted. I mentioned him in compari-
son to the “racehorse” goanna.
“Hanko’s” heavyweight lizard can
“scarp over a hundred yards in around
12 seconds.” In that time a “racehorse”
go. would be out of sight on the Nul*
larbor.

“Bo”; Sanderson had just finished har-
rowing his road paddock when old Ti-
tree Henderson, who periodically showed
up in the district after far wanderings,
drifted down the road. He stopped
opposite the Sanderson property and
dumped his knot on a cleared, grassed
patch. Then as an afterthought he
glanced up at the slightly moving tops of
the trees, gazed for a few moments at the
clouds, cryptically muttered “Don’t think
she’ll change,” picked up his swag and
dropped it over the four-strand wire
fence and climbed through. As he
lowered himself down on to it with a
sigh Sanderson said “What’s the diff. be-
tween this an’ the other side o’ the fence,
Ti-tree? Looks the same on both sides
to me.” The knot-humper looked up
quizzically. “Westerly blowin’,” he
replied tersely. “Man’d be a mug to doss
on the windward side when there’s a
fence to block it a bit!”
* * ♦ *
“Mat’s Mate”: “Struck one o’ them
boy wonders once,” Mat said. “He was
owned be a boardin’-house woman in
Mildura. Y’ couldn’t have a yarn or a
game o’ cards or anythin’ in the parlor
at night but what the little cow’d come in
an’ start, thumpin’ on the planner. Then
his mother would get him t’ sing, or
recite ‘Gunga Din’ or somethin’, an’ after
that he’d give what she called a impres-
sion of Napoleon leavin’ Moscow or
maybe Nelson dyin’ at Marston Moor.
Fair give us the willies, it did. Most of
us took t’ goin’ out or goin’t’ our rooms,
hut that Mildura’s a cold joint at prunin’
time an’ we wanted t’ be in the parlor
near the fire. Somebody bought a
draughtboard an’ we took it in turns t’
play him, but—cripes—it ain’t long before
he’s playin’ three or four of us at once
an’ recitin’ at the same time. Old Bill
Carmody wanted us t’ draw lots t’ see
who’d cut the kid’s throat, but we
wouldn’t come at that because we
reckoned the police’d find out. Yair, that
kid had us rattled, I tell y’.” He paused.
“Well,” I asked. “What did y’ do in the
end?” “Well, it was a funny thing,”
Mat said. “But some bloke taught him
that poem about the blankard from the
, bush, with all the dirty bits, an’ he comes
out with it one night. The boardin’-
house woman nilly had a blue fit an’ the
kid ain’t allowed t’ go near us any more.”
I didn’t need to seek the identity of the
tutor.
* * * *
“Sth. E.”: The boss had chipped one
of the men for bad shearing, and the team
at once held a meeting to consider the
affront. No boss, they decided, should
complain without reason. But they
could not prevent his complaints,
so their alternative was to supply
good and ample reason. They returned
to work. Soon a steady stream of lambs
was passing under machines that took a
blow here and there where the going was
easiest. Even the 50-a-day learner hit a
rate that promised a 200 tally before
knock-off. The boss eyed the half-shorn
animals, realised the futility of comment
and retired to the house to think things
over. Came dinner-time, and the team
trooped into the big dining-room. There
each shearer faced a hunk of steak that
had been dropped into the pan and as
promptly retrieved, plus an accompani-
ment of raw spuds fresh from a hot bath.
Following came a plate of hot, currant-
sprinkled dough, and a cup of lukewarm
water on which floated a scum of tea-
leaves. Then the trouble really started.
ROADSIDE HEDGES.
Where lanes and winding roadways go,
The wild and rambling hedges grow,
Taking the dust of cars and loads
That churn and plough the cloudy roads;
And all the dust the north winds Mow.
No pampered hedge is growing here;
No well-trimmed growth; but lance and spear,
And rugged sword against the sky
To stand on guard to passer-by:
Wild hedge with antlers like the deer.
Within its mass the grey post hides,
The wild weeds gather at its sides
And, with its spiked and homy hands,
Its thorned and twisted tangled strands,
Through flood and drought alike it rides.
Beneath its thick and secret mass
The early flowers star the grass;
The lazy lizard lies at rest;
The tits build hfgh their hidden nest
And bright eyes watch the stranger pass.
Stretched Tieath the dome of starry skies,
The wanderer in its shelter lies,
And through the hazy summer day,
The sleek and sleepy cattle stray
And in its shade close fast their eyes.
Old vagrant hedge of road and track
By paddock green and farm and stack,
How often have I lain and schemed
To be as wild as you and dreamed
That branches grew upon my back!
By more than clouds am I oppressed,
Yet I have lain and shared your rest
And still can hold in the mind’s eye
A robin in the blue of sky
Lighting your crown with his red breast!
VICTORIA.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DONT WORRY,IN SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Sheep on Small Farms.
“Mouton”: It is surprising
what may be made out of a
few sheep. A very small flock
becomes so quiet that the sheep
are almost pets, and will poke
about into all sorts of corners to
get their living. As far as one
can tell, they do not reduce to
any extent the carrying capacity
of the farm as far as a dairy
herd is concerned.
Forty ewes will thrive on a
small farm and produce at least
35 lambs, which will provide
ample mutton for a year for the
family. The money saved in
butchers’ bills is an important
consideration.
On the other hand, sold at
present top prices, they would
be worth about £7O. Reasonably
good ewes will cut about 20s.
per head worth of wool, and the
gross return from 40 ewes would
be about £llO. That’s a nice
sideline for a small farmer, and
for all practical purposes it may
be regarded as net return, be-
cause if the sheep were not kept
it is doubtful if any more cows
would be. No extra labor is
required. The shearing can be
done by the family. Besides the
useful money they return, sheep
are splendid scavengers, and can
be used to keep the weeds down
on the fallow and at certain
times of the year to eat the grass
down in the orchard.
Why Drenches Fail.
(Part 1.)
“J.R.D.”: Main reasons are
(1) wrong type of drench, (2)
dose too weak, (3) first drench
not followed by another or too
much delay between doses, (4)
faulty drenching technique, (5)
drenching at wrong time. There
are minor reasons for which the
human factor is mostly to blame.
(1) No single drench is effec-
tive against all internal para-
sites. The owner must know
which parasites are likely to be
causing trouble at any particu-
lar time. Successful drenching
must aim at prevention rather
than cure.
Certain districts —particularly
the tablelands and those with
fairly regular rainfall of 20
inches and upwards—offer the
most favorable conditions for
regular worm-infestation, and
owners in those areas know the
signs and act. Districts border-
ing on these areas often lose
more sheep through worms be-
cause the necessity for preventive
drenching is not recognised and
drenching is not done in time.
Then there are so-called
“safe” districts, where owners
believe drenching unnecessary,
but where under certain seasonal
conditions the biggest smashes
may and do occur. Few in drier
districts know the first thing
about drenching or are able to
diagnose worms, though in a
prolonged wet summer and
autumn worms may cause as
much loss as does the blowfly.
Successful sheepmen take the
trouble to learn how to keep
their stock healthy. By knowing
the life-cycles of the various in-
ternal and external parasites of
stock one is able to recognise the
symptoms of their ravages and
to know when to attack them.
One dose of the right drench
before the stock have started to
suffer will save money and pre-
vent loss.
Although some modern
drenches may cost more they
“Keep better time, Mum. Now—one, two, three, four!”
are much more effective, and
their proper use saves sheep
from diseases previously re-
garded as incurable. The main
internal parasites of sheep in
Australia are liver fluke, large
stomach - worm (barber’s - pole
worm), black scour, nodule and
large - mouthed bowel
Lesser ones are tapeworms,
lungworms, small stomach-
worms and coccidia. It will re-
pay any sheepowner hand-
somely to learn the habits of
each of at least the main group.
He will then be able to recog-
nise seasonal conditions favor-
able to the increase and danger
periods of each one and to take
steps to halt their progress be-
fore the stock are affected by
their unseen depredations.
Liver fluke is restricted to cer-
tain areas. Part of its life cycle
is spent outside the sheep and
depends on the presence of a
certain fresh-water snail. If we
could destroy the snail we could
save thousands of pounds. Blue-
stone will kill the snail, but once
established in the sheep fluke is
vulnerable only when it reaches
maturity. Meantime the imma-
ture fluke ploughing its way
through the organs may kill the
sheep if in sufficient numbers.
This is known as acute fluke
disease. Carbon-tetrachloride is
the recognised drench for fluke.
It will also kill bloodsucking
worms, and as the large stomach-
worm is of this type the use of
carb.-tet. at double strength
(2c.cs. carb.-tet. to 3c.cs.
paraffin) will keep both in check.
But the use of carb.-tet. should
be confined to these two para-
sites.
The one drench that may be
used effectively against all the
other major worm parasites is
phenothiazine, also effective
against large stomach - worm.
This means that by the intelli-
gent use of carb.-tet. and pheno-
thiazine all the important
internal parasites of sheep may
be controlled.
Bluestone-nicotine, which was
used extensively before pheno-
thiazine became available, is not
nearly so effective, blit has its
uses. Although its cost has
jumped considerably, it is still
cheaper on first cost than
phenothiazine, and for general
preventive drenching many
sheepmen stick to it. It is rea-
sonably effective against large
stomach and black-scour worms
and also against tapeworms and
small stomach-worms. Bluestone
used alone as a drench is limited
to the control of large stomach-
worms, and has to be used at a
high concentration in adult
sheep, with sometimes toxic
effects.
Bluestone - arsenic, an old
remedy, is cheap, but is effec-
tive only against large stomach-
worms, Broadly speaking, large
stomach worms are usually
associated with wet summers,
and, being bloodsuckers, can be
detected by pale skin, but more
readily by a paling of the eye
membranes of the sheep. Con-
dition is not affected to the same
extent as with other parasites,
and fat sheep may be found
dead—practically drained of
blood.
Motor Hints.
“Radian”: When an engine
stands idle for any time, lubricat-
ing oil drains away from pistons,
rings and cylinder walls and is
only restored after several
minutes of running. Thus it is
that an engine which is running
almost constantly will not wear
as quickly as one that runs once
a week. Before starting an
engine that has been standing
idle it pays to inject a small
quantity of oil —about a tea-
spoonful—through each spark-
plug hole. This only takes a few
minutes and definitely cuts down
on cylinder wear.
To rid a petrol-tank of water,
take it off and drain as far as
possible. Fasten a piece of
chamois leather to a length of
wire and swab out still 'further.
Pour a pint of methylated spirit
into the tank, swill it well round
for several minutes and drain.
The metho will collect minute
globules of water and carry them
out or hasten their drying-up.
Finally, stand the tank in a warm
place until quite dry, then re-
place.
Docility Pays.
“C.S.”: It does with Poll
Shorthorns in Tasmania, accord-
ing to W, R. Gibson, of Scone,
near Launceston. Upon decid-
ing to start a. registered stud, he
went to N.S.W. and bought a
bull and some females from E, L.
Killen, of Mumbil, as a founda-
tion. Since then he has added to
these purchases, endeavoring to
select the best females available,
Gibson says the docility of the
breed appeals to him, as he runs
all his cattle in paddocks divided
by sheep fences only. In Tas-
mania a large proportion of the
breeding country and larger
holdings are rough country, and
given over to cross-breeding, and
with a high standard of bulls
maintained there is a big open-
ing for the Poll Shorthorn.
Gibson recently exhibited Poll
Shorthorns at the National Show
in Launceston,
Win for Black Polls.
“Agric”: Six Aberdeen-
Angus steers, aged 25 months,
won the second of the 1948
Queensland Meat Industry
Board’s beef-carcass competi-
tions for the Scottish-Australian
Co., Texas Station, Texas, on
the Queensland-N.S.W. border.
Average weight was 643i1b.,
and points scored totalled 520.
Last May Texas won a similar
competition with its entry of
steers, averaging
7311 b., and it also won the
championship at the 1948 Syd-
ney Easter Show for pasture-fed
steers.
When presenting the prizes
Agriculture Minister Collins said
it had been stated that Queens-
land could not rival Argentina
in quality meat, that it did not
pay to fatten steers at years
but to sell them at four and five
years. All the prize-winning
carcasses in the competition
were under three years,
which showed that, at least
under some conditions, Queens-
land could produce meat equal
to that produced anywhere.
Three of the seven entries
judged were rejected as being
over the stipulated 7501 b.
dressed weight. Aberdeen-
Angus also secured second
place, W. E. Webster, Sarum,
Kingaroy, finishing only two
points behind the winner with
steers averaging 6651 b. (518
points).
Citrus Health.
“Myrrhee”: A general yel-
lowing of the leaves is the chief
sign of nitrogen deficiency, and
nitrogen in either artificial or
organic form is needed. Sul-
phate of ammonia, 81b. to the
tree, applied three or four weeks
before flowering, is one of the

Organic manures are slower

Lamps formerly consisted of a
crude wick soaking in a container
of oil or grease. In 1783, one
Argand made the revolutionary
discovery that a circular cotton wick,
with central draught and the flame
surrounded by a glass chimney,
increased the illuminating power
enormously. By 1860, petroleum
or kerosene had also displaced the
animal and vegetable oils formerly
used.
Effective as kerosene lamps became, particularly with
the advent of the incandescent mantle, they were
superseded by the rapid development of the electric
lamp—pre-eminent for clear lighting, safety and

MAT, : Bush marrows may
bo sown until mid-December.
They are suitable for dry
climates as the circular bush
shades the soil and protects the
fruit from sunburn. The white
varieties are excellent for bak-
mg or stuffing, whilst the dark
green are better keepers and are
more like pumpkin in flavor.
The small custard marrows grow
very quickly and mature early,
make good pies and are con-
vement for stuffing with savory
mince before baxing. Running
varieties of marrow may be
trained over fences to save space.
“Bat”: Rockmelons may be
sown until the end of December,
Ordinary loam may be enriched
with well-rotted stable manure,
and a small handful of mixed
fertiliser will ensure success
from every seed hillock if plenty
of water is available. If it is
not, don’t use artificial manures,
but mulch around young plants
and keep the soil loose when
they are firmly rooted.
“Myrrhee”: Climber beans
have a more extensive root-
system than dwarf varieties and
need a deep, friable soil,
Trench the row 18in. wide to a
depth of 2ft,, digging in plenty
of manure. Plant either per-
ennial varieties (White Monarch
or White Czar) or annual
(Epicure) and keep them well
watered. The bean is a warm-
weather plant, but needs plenty
of water. Use Bft. stakes placed
tentwise for support and tie them
where they cross, making a V-
shaped trough a few inches from
the top. Place a ridge-pole along
the trough to hold the stakes in
position. When in flower give
the plants an overhead sprink-
hng once a day; the humidity
thus created helps to set the

“Myrr”: If growth of leaf
crops, beetroot or tomatoes
slackens before maturity, work
in an ounce of sulphate of
ammonia or blood manure to
the square yard. For silver-beet,
Chinese cabbage and other
vegetables which produce over
an extended period, apply as a
liquid manure loz. of sulphate
of ammonia to the gallon to each
plant once a fortnight. Keep the
stuff away from the leaves or
they’ll burn or russet.
“Yendis”: A quick method
for grouting bolts into concrete
or brick'walls is as follows: Use
a mortar of one part of cement
to two and a half parts of fine
sand, fairly stiff. After packing
around the bolt slip a short
length of pipe over the bolt and
hammer the mortar with this
until firm. Repeat until mortar
is flush with the outside of the
wall. It is necessary for the pipe
to fit neatly in the hole and
around the bolt. Bolts grouted
in by this method can be used
immediately and will take heavy
bearers without loosening.
“Green Ink”: pulling
weatherboards off buildings take
the bottom board off first, even
if you have to split it off, then
tap the next one flat against the
studs. The nails will then pro-
trude about Hhi., and are easily
pulled (a crook-ended jemmy is
the ideal tool). The board will
then fall to the floor. Carry on
likewise to the top and all your
boards will be undamaged.


A little patience can
save you a lot of money
£
Because Vauxhall can save them £5O to £2OO, and Vauxhall
is the proved favourite British car for Australian conditions,
more and more buyers are thinking twice before spending
possibly hundreds of pounds more than necessary. Every
year since 1934, when Australians were free to choose
any car they wanted, they bought more Vauxhalls than any
other British make.
If you must have immediate delivery, no matter what it
may cost you, there’s no more to be said. But if you’re
not in quite that hurry, it will pay you to wait for Vauxhall,
the car that will suit you best and save you money into the
bargain. Your Vauxhall dealer has all the facts —the
detailed figures of purchases of all British cars since 1934
and ail the details about Vauxhall’s current engineering
and value leadership. Before you commit yourself to
purchasing any make of car, see your Vauxhall Dealer.

The other men also mumbled
their thanks out of throats
parched with hope deferred,
THAT evening Mrs. Denholm
sat in Alex’s den with her
knitting, dropping stitches by the
score and picking them up again
with stubborn intensity while
Alex telephoned the neighbors,
producing many forceful argu-
ments if they were inclined to
doubt that the fiesta would be a
good thing. When he put in his
sixth call she suddenly inter-
rupted impatiently,
“If you’re so keen on jit why
on earth don’t you just decide
to have your fiesta?”
Alex looked at her astonished.
“I didn’t say I was keen on
it. And I don’t want to have
you worried.”
“But,” said Mrs. Denholm, on
the verge of tears, “do you want
to hive a lot of Italian prisoners
thinking that you’re not master
in your own house?”
Next morning when the men
came in for breakfast they took
one look at Alex and started ex-
changing little half-hidden grins
with each other. Alex had no
need to tell them what he had
decided.
Maringoni looked at him
worshipfully with shining eyes.
He thanked him over and over
again in a soft caressing voice.
Veracini muttered several
“Tank-you’s,” and wiped the
tears from his eyes. Rizzio put
on a smug, contented grin as if
he had expected it all along.
THE day passed in a fever of
excitement, and after tea
Alex allowed the men to take
the bicycles and circulate the
grand news. All night the dogs
barked at strange comings and
goings and at the buzz of con-
versation at the men’s cottage.
In the morning the men were
still bright, but Maringoni
seemed careworn. He had been
appointed chief cook and it was
a “responsibilita tremenda-
menta.”
Each time they came in for a
meal Maringoni approached
Mrs. Denholm in great concern
with some problem. Did she
have some “levito” he wanted to
know, making motions with his
hands something like a man
playing an accordion vertically.
Eventually she guessed that
he meant “yeast,” and promised
to get him some. Then he asked
about some kind of utensil
whose function he demonstrated
for fifteen minutes before they
discovered that the Italian name
for “colander” was the same as
the English.
By Saturday morning the
family was deeply in the
Italians’ confidence and ines-
capably involved in their plans.
The men got the morning off
(as well as the afternoon) in
order to make their preparations.
The spaghetti was to be of a
special kind for the great occa-
sion, namely “spaghetti verdi” ;
the “green” being achieved by
first cooking a huge quantity of
spinach and mincing it fine, to
be later added to the “eggs,
flour” mixture. The yeast-cakes
also had to be prepared, and
here there was a fatal difficulty
because it had not rained two
inches, so the two bottles of
wine were not forthcoming.
Mrs, Denholm eventually
donated the wine.
WHILE Maringoni worked in
the kitchen with busy hands
and anxious brow Veracini and
Rizzio prepared the banqueting
hall, a long verandah off the
kitchen, protected by a bougain-
villea creeper.
They scrubbed the floor,
tables and seats in a passion for
perfection, and when it was
spotlessly clean and wholesome
they begged flowers from Mrs.
Denholm to decorate the tables.
They gushed over the flowers
as much as a couple of newly-
rich ladies in an expensive
florist shop, and when they had
done their best with them they
called excitedly to Mrs. Den-
holm to come and see how
“molto bello” everything was.
On Sunday morning Alex was
awakened very early by resound-
ing shouts of “Buon fiesta”
coming from half a mile down
his avenue. He got out of bed
to welcome his first guests. Half
a dozed knowing - looking
prisoners, wearing a most serious
mien, were in the kitchen with
Maringoni to see how the cakes
had risen. Unanimously they
turned to him, their faces lit up
with lavish smiles and their eyes
shone as they beheld the most
grand and generosamente signor.
They crowded round to shake
hands with him and to thank
him. Then they congratulated
Maringoni again, this time for
having such a “buon padrone.”
A little fellow with villain-
ously black eyes and the sinister
name of Ciano confided to Alex
that his padrone was “molto
avaro.” He never gave him any-
thing ; never took him to town,
and made him work “as long as
the sun” every day. But he
assured Alex, in the most pain-
fully incomprehensible language,
that it made him very happy to
meet a man like him in a country
like Australia, and he promised
that when he returned to Italy he
would send him a great parcel
(as big as he could embr|ce in
his arms) for Christmas.
A gang of picked men was
soon at work in the kitchen
rolling and cutting the spaghetti
verdi. All the men who had no
work to do (and most of those
who did) were taking an extra-
ordinary interest in Ina, who
had forgone her week-end off
to be at the fiesta. Many of
them probably hadn’t spoken to
a girl for years.
All the while the great cakes
were baking in the oven. Each
time Maringoni opened the
door half a dozen eager heads
were thrust in to look and half
a dozen voices exclaimed in de-
light at the continued rising; at
the golden crisping of the out-
side ; and a dozen eyes narrowed
anxiously over the hatpin thrust
into the cakes, which showed
undeniable indications that the
baking within was not keeping
pace with the outside. Profound
discussions followed each view-
ing.
But the savory and the
spaghetti verdi progressed mar-
vellously. The time came when
they were ready to be served,
and everyone was delighted with
the odor of one and the texture
and color of the other. Only
Maringoni’s worried brow re-
minded them of the cakes.
ALEX and his wife were set
in the place of highest honor,
but Ina, who by this time was in
a state of irresponsible exaltation
through having about twenty
men competing passionately for
her favors, was capricious and
uncontrollable, and would not
stay seated anywhere. Alex and
Mrs. Denholm, acting up to
eager expectations, exclaimed
loud and long about the “bella
mangare” and its “bella flavore.”
Then the prisoners started on
plates piled with three times as
much as Alex would have under-
taken in his most lighthearted
moments. Every time Alex
looked up twenty heads turned
to bow to him and faces lit with
smiles for him.
The dogs began to bark
furiously, and Alex had a
moment of horrible panic, be-
lieving that Captain Pillory had
plotted to catch him red-handed.
All the prisoners looked down
the road, vastly concerned. They
gave a little cheer when it
turned out to be a short, fat man
in prisoner red pedalling a
bicycle.
Soon a great shout of “Giu-
seppe Carofilio” went up. They
left the table after hasty
“scusami’s” to crowd round the
scapegoat. Soon several came
rushing back to Alex to tell a
most exciting and heroic story.
Giuseppe had spent five days
in the “calaboose” on bread and
water; been sent to a farm twenty
miles on the other side of Wag-
hurst and told not to put one
foot outside the boundary for
the next month on pain of the
direst punishment. There he had
heard of the rearranged fiesta
by way bf the prisoners’ grape-
vine and had gone A.W.L. to be
at it, starting before dawn.
A PLACE was made for Giu-
seppe. He inspected the
dishes critically, sniffing with his
long, twitching nose and ap-
parently did not think very
highly of them. Nevertheless,
he immediately began to shovel
huge quantities into his mouth.
Then Maringoni, now visibly
shrunken since Giuseppe’s ap-
pearance, remembered the cakes.
Everyone shouted confidently
that Giuseppe should be shown.
Maringoni brought one out to
him, but he gave it no hope.
Then, to make the besj; of an
unredeemably bad job, he ad-
vised that they be cut in halves
and the uncooked interiors ex-
posed to the heat of the oven.
Maringoni soon returned to the
table, but he did not eat much.
He stole crestfallen looks at
Giuseppe, round whom all the
attention centred.
Giuseppe was talking boast-
fully all the time and shooting
sly glances in Alex’s direction
now and then as if he thought
himself completely master of the
situation. The black-eyed Ciano,
who had the “avaricious” em-
ployer, and all the other meek
and well - behaved prisoners
listened absorbed, and Alex had
no doubt that they were learn-
ing a lot about how to handle
these Australians.
MRS. DENHOLM suddenly
stopped eating and rose
‘from the table.
“This food is awfully rich,”
she said to Alex. “I’ll have to
go and take some bismag or I’ll
be ill,” She looked at him
earnestly after glancing round
the table and added “I don’t
think I’ll come back.”
Alex stopped eating, too;
suddenly aware that a feeling of
deep depression was creeping up
from his overloaded stomach.
He looked around the table, and
the few men who caught his eye
gave him uncomfortable and
half-apologetic smiles before
turning again to Giuseppe.
Ina, with a pair of disillu-
sioned and frustrated lovers
paying her half-interested atten-
tion, was sulking in a manner
that would have done credit to
the most heartbroken Italian.
She made several remarks about
Giuseppe, loud, coarse and de-
cidedly unpleasant, of which
Alex approved unreservedly.
Giuseppe’s arrival had made it
almost certain that the celebra-
tion of St. Joseph’s Day would
become known to the Control
Centre, and, even if he contrived
to escape the worst conse-
quences of that, he knew that his
neighbors would never forgive
him for the ruinous effect Giu-
seppe’s escapade and all his sub-
versive talk would have on their
prisoners’ discipline.,

The Stranger.
Dr. Herbert Vere was once
again the darling of the Soviet
press. Who knew? If he kept
up the good work of embarras-
sing Britain and America at
U.N.O. they might even honor,
him by renaming one of the pot-
holed back lanes in Leningrad
the Evattski Prospekt! M.
Vyshinsky had already presented
him, as a mark of the Politburo’s
appreciation, with a specially-
mounted cast of a model of
Russia’s only but truly won-
derful invention-contribution to
the Allied victory: the famous
set of false teeth for cows.
Herbert Vere had been a little
puzzled at the unreasonably
critical attitude of the British
and American delegations and
press to what they unwarrantably
termed his barging in on the
Berlin problem. What they
utterly failed to appreciate was
that had he refrained from doing
so the World Citizen No, 1
would have lost a lot of valuable
self-publicity. As a result of his
bold action his name was even
then probably being spoken of
with deep respect, perhaps with
actual awe, by the Dhoubs of
Cambodia, the Bhoubs of Balu-
chistan and even the Trhoubs of
Tramlandia.
The outcry over the Berlin in-
cident had barely died down
when news reached the Cackle
Factory at Lake Success that
Ecuador had been snarling at
Mexico over an incident which
had in it the germs of a Third
World War.
From garbled accounts it
seemed that, during a lull in the
conversation at a diplomatic
banquet in Mexico City the
Fourth Secretary to the
Ecuadorian Consulate, hear-
ing a loud stomach rumble
coming from the direction
of the lady seated on his
left, had immediately
jumped # up and gallantly
apologised for the miscreant
behavior of his internal
works. Incensed at having
been beaten to ' this quixotic
action, the Fifth Secretary
of the Mexican Foreign
Office, who was seated on
the other side of the lady,
rose and explained that his Ex-
cellency the Senor Cascara
Menincacheesa had evidently
been mistaken by the ventrilo-
quial nature of the stomachic dis-
turbance. It could have emanated
from none other than his own,
for he always rumbled in a basso
profundo. By the very nature
of Senor Menincacheesa’s
scraggy build he would opine
that had he possessed the virility
to rustle up a rumble undoubt-
edly it would be in a silvery
tenor.
At what he regarded as a
mortal insult to his country the
Ecuadorian diplomat seized an
Iceland poppy from a vase and
struck the Mexican heavily on
the wrist with it. Stung at the
physical hurt, the Mexican hotly
rasped out thah all Ecuador
could produce was skinny
bananas.
His gorge rising at this mortal
insult to his country’s justly-
famed fruit, Senor Cascara had
bellowed that the only thing that
had produced more revolutions
than Mexico was an aeroplane
propeller.
No Mexican could possibly be
expected to stand his country’s
political stability being thus
maligned, and the Fifth Secre-
tary challenged the Ecuadorian
to a duel. The latter had in %
“ Yes , it IS an X. Now ,
what's the next line?"
white heat accepted, nominating
as weapons ball cannon at three
feet.
There the matter was resting
when the World’s Ace Trouble-
Shooter, then in Paris trying, on
U.N.O.’s behalf, to buy into a
Balkans fight, heard of this latest
dread threat to the world’s peace.
Hiring a fleet of planes for him-
self and retinue, he rushed back
to the Cackle Factory to set the
General Assembly in , vocal
motion.
Arriving at Lake Success, an
awful thought descended on
Herbert Vere. Perhaps at that
very moment a hot-headed Ecua-
dorian army was marching south
looking for its hated enemy; a
concourse of armed and fierce
Mexicans might be scanning the
northern horizon awaiting the
appearance of the invading
Ecuadorians!
Without waiting to hear an
official version of the incident
or from any high-ranking
neutral diplomats who had been
present, the World’s Ace
Trouble-Shooter rushed in and
condemned the Ecuadorian dip-
lomat for his action. A chief
Mexican official immediately
announced that his country
would create Dr. Evatt
an honorary bullfighter, the
highest honor it could bestow,
and that should the doctor ever
visit Mexico City the largest and
most ferocious bull available
would be put at his disposal for
him to dispatch.
Before this row had died down
the World’s Ace Trouble-Shooter
had hopped in with some un-
wanted criticism on a barney
going' ,on between Chile and
Peru. Both countries told him
to mind his own business.
But such shafts fell blunted
from the pachydermatous hide.
Now regarding himself as
the heavy father of the
whole 58 , nations, Bertie
gate-crashed \ another sharp
exchange, this time be-
tween Holland and Vene-
zuela, only to get, another
knuckle-rap. \
It was while he was tear-
ing like a scalded cat, from
Security Council to Assehajbly
and trying to buy in to argu-
ments going on between tern
small nations that Dr. Evatt’s
fourth sub-secretary informed
him there was a message for him
from Canberra.
Bertie looked at the official
with a faraway look as he tried
to sort all the nations in his
whirling brain. Then in a
puzzled voice he said: “Can-
berra? I’ve heard the name be-
fore somewhere. What country
is it in?”

Rabaul
There can’t be many places that think
more of the pre-war past and less of the
post-war future than Rabaul, former
capital of New Guinea. Few places have
better reason for thinking that way. With
only 40 years of history behind it,
Rabaul is already more of a t£ has-been”
than a “will-be,” or even an “is.”
Even in German times, Blanche Bay,
at the northern end of New Britain, was
a questionable choice as Administrative
headquarters. The whole district is a
volcanic hot-spot, and evidence of activity
was all too clear. Only four degrees
south of the Equator, it was hardly a
health resort. But to the German mind
economic factoA outweighed these dis-
advantages. They found in the Simpson-
hafen arm of Blanche Bay what they
wanted —a fine safe harbor in the midst
of the Bismarck Archipelago which, with
its coconut plantations, shell and sea-
borne trade, was the most important part
of German New Guinea. Besides, they
wanted to get their Administrative centre
away from the wretchedly fever-stricken
mainland co/ast. Accordingly, in 1910,
the Kaiser s Governor was installed at
Rabaul. f ■
. The Australians, taking over forcibly
in 1914, found a steamy, breezeless, none-
too-hsalthy little town, shut in between
harbor and hills, and overlooked by
menacing volcanoes. But it was a going
concern, the only really considerable
I settlement in the colony, and they retained
it as capital. After the organisation of
the Mandate, Rabaul grew aad thrived
until it was the largest and most adult
town in any of Australia’s external terri-
tories. In f he ’thirties, with the develop-
ment of the mainland goldfields, the
Territory began to grow away from its
capital, but while it remained the seat of
government Rabaul had little to fear.
In 1937, its peak year, it was a little
cosmopolis of 9000 people, with over
800 Europeans and 1500 assorted Asiatics,
mostly Chinese, against a predominating
native background. It was well supplied
with shops, European and Chinese, and
native markets. Its gracious bungalows
and tree-lined avenues gave some force
to its claim to be a “garden city.” Its
social life, centred on three good clubs
and three good hotels, and headed by
the Administrator, was the brightest and
best-organised in the Territory. The
natives knew their place, and kept it —■
in those days, a native meeting a Euro-
pean on the sidewalk would step respect-
fully aside into the street out of his path.
The white man was really “masta.”
Altogether, despite climate, volcanoes and
almost daily earth tremors, the capital
must have seemed a pleasant and secure
place to live in.
Rabaul’s brief heyday ended with a
big bang. On May 29, 1937, its pet
volcano, the ever-smoking Matupi, ex-
ploded into shattering activity. The same
day saw a fire-belching horror, appropri-
ately christened Vulcan, rise 600 ft. out of
the harbor waters. The native mortality
in this twin eruption ran into the hun-
dreds. The town was buried in pumice-
dust, and though actual damage was
tremendous, the chiefi sufferer was
Rabaul’s future. The place was plainly
unsafe, and expert opinion recommended
its abandonment. Accordingly, arrange-
ments were made to remove the Adminis-
tration to Lae on the mainland, and this
transfer was in very leisurely process of
implementation when the Pacific War
brought down devastation on the whole
Territory. The capital itself, seized and
held by the Japanese and pulverised by
Allied bomber fleets, was wiped out.
When peace came, Rabaul was barely
more than a name and a memory.
Today it has made a comeback of
sorts. A scattered Army-hut and shanty
town, with the unofficial title of capital
of New Britain, is growing up hap-
hazardly, untidily and not very happily
on the same old volcano-threatened site.
Gone are the bungalows, the tree-lined
avenues, and the well-established social
order. In their place are huts and
humpies of galvanised-iron, fibre, sack-
ing and whatever other materials the
builders could lay their hands on, a few
dusty unsurfaced roads, and the New
Order. Natives no longer step off the
sidewalks for Europeans, one reason be-
ing that there are no sidewalks now, and
another that the natives don’t walk any
more. They drive around in jeeps and
trucks. The harbor foreshores are clut-
tered with the rusting, unsightly wreck-
age of Japanese ships. There are short-
ages of everything, desperate in the case
of building materials. There is one club,
and one hotel, housed in an old Army
canteen hutment.
There is a general air of uncertainty
and temporariness. Nobody knows when
the next eruption will take place, or if
the place is to be abandoned. The
rumored plan to make Kokopo, itself
only 18 miles away, take the place of
Rabaul still seems to be only a plan. In
the meantime, Rabaul is being allowed to
gather population, which must eventually
be transferred elsewhere. The longer the
move is delayed, the greater the risk, and
the more expensive it will be.
Rabaul, ultimately, is doomed.
Whether its end will come with a
Vesuvius-type eruption, or whether there
will be a local repetition of the Mar-
tinique catastrophe of May, 1902, when
33,000 lives were snuffed out in three
minutes, is hidden in the future. Any
one of the town’s five volcanoes, in spite
of the fact that three are labelled
“dormant,” could bring about its de-
struction.
In view of this ever-present risk there
shouldn’t be any question of Rabaul’s
future. It shouldn’t be allowed to have
any.—K. A. S. (N.G.).
Compulsion
What has happened to the character-
istic Australian fighting spirit? There
was no apparent reaction to Mr. Chifley’s
announcement that “there will have to be
transfers of workers, and in many cases
whole communities, to other forms of
work.” Ten years ago industrial con-
scription was one of the ugliest features
of the Nazi regime, yet here in Australia
the same distasteful forced labor is now
openly advocated.
There are only two ways of getting
things done in this world—by inducement
or compulsion. There is no limit to what
men will endure if there is sufficient in-
ducement. Whether in the form of a
school scholarship or a monetary prize
attached to an event like the England-
Australia Centenary air race, there is no
better incentive than some personal re-
ward to stimulate human activity.
Compulsion, however, requires at least
two conditions: (1) someone must have
authority and power to force obedience,
and (2) the person directed must have no
avenue of escape. Already the Un-
employment and Sickness Benefits Act
denies benefits to anybody refusing to
accept employment where directed, and
the “free-medicine” plan will draw the
net even closer. Everything is being
woven into a pattern of totalitarianism—-
all we have to do is carry out instruc-
tions and we’ll have a standard of
security comparable with any of Aus-
tralia’s leading prisons. Moorabool
(Vic.). ■
Potatoes
Potatoes may be scarce for some years,
but it is unfair to blame the newly-
constituted Potato Marketing Board,
which is grower-controlled, and has only
just begun operations.
The cost of growing potatoes up to
the harvesting stage, including cost of
seed, is about £lO per acre. Average
yield is about 3£ tons per acre, but of
that only No. 1 grade spuds go to the
purchaser (or should), which means that
undergrades are sold for what they can
bring.
In an average crop. No. 1 potatoes
represent about one-third of the total
yield, so that, under the contract system
whereby Mr. Chifley guaranteed growers
£l4 a ton less certain charges, the gross
average yield per acre was about £l5
on the guaranteed price. By selling the
undergrades, if you were lucky, this gross
return was increased to about £25 per
acre. Harvesting costs, however, worked
out at 6s. per bag, or £25 for the 3y tons.
Thus, growers, if they were lucky, came
just about square. I’ve grown nearly
700 tons in the last seven years and lost
money. •
Potatoes are a political football because
they are the only vegetable taken into
account in calculating the basic wage.
Efforts by farmers to have the guaran-
teed price raised during the war were
countered by Government policy of keep-
ing prices down. Much the same policy
still applies, but to encourage potato-
growing on any scale the grower will
have to be guaranteed at least £25 per
ton for No. 1 grade.— Red Earth
(N.S.W.).
Rationing
The most sinister feature of rationing
is the way it turns our moral values up-
side down. If, for example, I have two
loaves and my neighbor has none, four
courses are open to me: (1) As a good
Christian, I may give him one; (2) On a
slightly lower plane I may lend him one ;
(3) Coldly commercial, I may sell him
one or (4) I may churlishly refuse him.
The first two courses would be com-
mended by all. The third would earn
neither praise nor blame provided I sold
at a fair market price. The last course
would be universally condemned.
The same holds true if the articles in
question are legs of mutton or shirts.
But if they are gallons of petrol, pounds
of butter or packets of tea, then Christian
ethics, mateship and commercial instincts
must all go together into the discard. No
matter how desperate my neighbor’s need,
I must stick to (4) or make criminals of
us both. — Magnoon (Q.).
Farm Labor
As a banker in country towns for
many years I’ve made a close study of
the problems of farmers. At present
their great troubles are labor and
materials. Shortage of materials can be
understood and the reason assessed, but
the labor trouble goes back a long way.
Dairymen, wheatfarmers and graziers
have been a hard-working, hard-living
band of men, caring little for social
activities and outside interests. They had
little spare time; work and the ambition
to develop their holdings and satisfac-
torily place their usually large families
proved a full-time job. Living and think-
ing that way they developed a rather
ruthless outlook regarding the treatment
of employees, even their own kith and
kin. Hired men were called upon to
work long hours at a pace set by the
boss; they often lived under primitive
conditions and were subject to the sack
at any moment if they did not quite suit,
or if seasonal prospects were not promis-
ing. 9
With gradual enlightenment, the coun-
try worker began to think that he had
had a raw deal, and there was a conse-
quent growth of antipathy between the
landowner and his employee. In many
instances in the past the man on the land
could have treated his workmen better,
both financially and in general conditions.
There are some vital factors to be con-
sidered today. Take the case of married
men employed on stations and farms.
Their wives find themselves without
electric light, running water, sewerage or
other modern amenities. Even the
poorest city dweller generally enjoys those
conveniences. Then there is education.
Some years ago parents didn’t worry
much about it, but the times and the
people have changed. The country
worker is sometimes six or seven miles
or further from a school and he can’t
afford to send his children to boarding
school. So he finds a job in a neaf-by
town, sends his children to the local
school, where they quickly forget any in-
terest they had in farming.
In the town, too, his wife enjoys
modern household conveniences, goes to
the pictures once a week and does plenty
of window-shopping and gossiping. I’ve
talked with many women who left farms
for the towns, and none of them would
dream of going back.
How are these things to be remedied?
Some never will, and over the years the
grazier and farmer who employs per-
manent labor will gradually disappear.
His holdings will be reduced by a slow
evolution, and the land will be owned
and worked in smaller units by one in-
dividual. A few very big landowners
who have outside incomes will be able
to afford homes for their employees with
all modern appliances, plus education for
the children and a weekly visit to the
pictures thrown in. And there will always
be those who prefer the loneliness of
outback, but their numbers are shrinking.
In the long run this elimination of
the large landowner may not be
a bad thing for AustraUa. In 'his favor,
the big holder can, and does in many
instances, spend large sums in improving
flocks and herds, thereby rendering un-
told benefits to production generally. But
that isn’t enough to ensure his survival. —
C. B. M. (N.S.W.).'
Road Accidents
Drastic measures are needed to deal
with the alarming increase in motor
accidents and fatalities caused by
drunken drivers. The major difficulty is
determining whether or not a driver is
actually under the influence. Police and
medical opinions differ so often that
motorists are quick to take advantage
of conflicting opinions escape both
conviction and punishment.
In America the National Safety
Council has found that one in five of
American drivers and one in four adult
pedestrians involved in fatal accidents in
1947 had been drinking. Experts who
are trying to find a foolproof method of
determining when a man is intoxicated
claim that there is a definite relation be-
tween the proportion of alcohol in the
blood and the degree of intoxication.
Once the alcohol in the blood exceeds
.15 per cent, a person is under the in-
fluence. It has been established that
when a driver reached this degree of
alcoholic absorption he became 55 times
more prone to personal injury than the
non-drinking driver.
From all this it appears that the
nearest solution so far discovered is a
blood test in every case. American ex-'
perts, while not claiming that blood tests
are the find answer, suggest that such
tests take the guesswork out of deciding
whether a driver is under the influence,
or whether he is suffering from such con-
ditions as injury, illness, shock or ex-
treme fatigue—all of which may produce
symptoms similar to those of intoxication.
In the absence of any better one, we
should adopt the American method. The
tests will at least help to convict the
guilty and protect the innocent and re-
strict those who would otherwise mix
drinking and driving.
The only other effective method of
curbing the menace is cancellation of
driving licences. Fines and other mone-
tary punishments won’t eradicate the
drunken road-hog. He must be kept off
the roads entirely.—W. S. (Vic.).
“W.P.T.” (B. 22/9/’4B) is right-most
drivers involved in accidents could pass
any driving test. It’s mainly a question
of temperament. Impatience and selfish-
ness, not incompetence, are responsible
for most accidents. Speed-hogs should
be thoroughly punished, but they are not
the only menaces.
Having coaxed my mobile bedstead for
over 25 years and emerged unscathed, I
would suggest that traffic-police should
pay more attention to:, —
(1) Drivers who give incorrect signals
or fail to give signals.
(2) Glaring and incorrectly-focused
headlights which drivers fail to dip when
approaching oncoming traffic,
(3) Potential murderers who, travelling
at excessive speed, ignore the white lines
when ascending hills or bends to pass
slower-moving cars. These criminals give
drivers of oncoming cars little chance of
avoiding a serious or fatal accident.
(4) Cyclists, especially at night and in
industrial areas. Many bike-riders carry
neither headlamps nor rear-reflectors. On
Parramatta-road (Sydney) on any week
night between 5.30 and 7 and 11 and
midnight groups of bike-riders can be
seen riding three, and often four, abreast,
the tooting of a horn by a motorist is
the signal for a tirade of abuse sultry
enough to explode the radiator.
Cars, trucks and motor-bikes are
licensed and subjected to annual tests for
roadworthiness. Why not include bi-
cycles and insist that headlamps ana
rear-reflectors are of suitable standar
and correctly installed? —Spake Part

terms by the art critic of the Sydney
“Sun,” Mr. Tatlock Miller.
Thus Mr. Miller (“Sun,” Wednesday,
November 3):
Stimulating in its eclecticism and wideness
of range, at times extraordinarily forceful
and surprisingly gay, an exhibition of
paintings by Paul Haefliger is a massive,
impressive affair.
Once sombre, heavy-hearted and even
lugubrious, the work of this Swiss-Aus-
tralian artist was often weighed down by
its very volume and mass. Rather than pro-
fundity it reflected an anxiety to please
not so much ourselves as its author.
With an unexpectedness quite startling
in its effect is now discovered a new spon-
taneity and lightness of spirit. He IMr.
Haefliger, presumably] smiles with Bonnard
and Matisse and one welcomes and shares
his gaiety in “Girl with Flowers.”
Mr. Tatlock Miller must have a highly
developed sense of gaiety. “Girl with
Flowers” is a painting of a blue lady,
flowers, fruit and a knife, the lady with
blue expressionless face resting on one
blue hand. It is possible to contemplate
it unmoved, but if one is forced to a
definition it ia “lugubrious,” but sketchy.
There are, true, no immense volume or
overpowering masses. And it is possible
to concede that the artist may have been
feeling uncommonly joyous when he
painted it —which is a matter between him
and his conscience. But even more than
it resembles Matisse and Bonnard it re-
sembles Mr. Haefliger’s other painting,
“The Table,” which also has flowers,
fruit, a knife and an impassive female
head.
The critique continues:
Previous work had prepared for another
discipleship, other guides, and the pursuit
of Kokoschka’s gravely beautiful monu-
mentality. How else could Family have
come into being or People have been so
vigorously achieved, the latter with enor-
mous success, with Daumier?
Rouault led to Emmaus, but Near
Bathurst remains Haefliger alone. When he
dreams it is of Chagall.
Blinking one’s eyes firmly against the
intimidating flourish of Kokoschka,
Daumier, Rouault and the dream-inspir-
ing Chagall, one suspects that what Mr.
Tatlock Miller is trying to say, as tact-
fully as possible, is that Haefliger’s work
is derivative. Haefliger’s particular
attack of “monumentality” in his art
manifests itself in paintings of buildings,
and in the Macquarie Exhibition traces
of it can be discerned in “Young’s”—an
uninspiring view of a comer grocery shop
—“Old Stable” and “King’s Cross.” “Old
Stable” is a hotchpotch of distant city,
trees, a telegraph-pole, some white
masonry, a putty-colored bank and
orange earth. It is not so “lugubrious”
as many Haefliger paintings, but, like the
works of the numerous school of Sydney
painters likewise preoccupied with old
shops, houses and pubs—in particular,
Russell Drysdale and Salj Herman —
there is less of the charm of old
stone and dignity in it than of emphasis
of oddity; with, however, less deliberate
ugliness than is characteristic of the
school. “King’s Cross,” too—which looks
more like a view from Double Bay —
has only architectural interest. It is, how-
ever, pleasant in a brittle way, with an
unorthodox perspective.
“Bondi Junction,” a view of an orange
cutting, a fence and a climbing dark
background, has the solid virtue of
observation and warmth. But the
work on the .whole is heavy, dull
and marred by the technical disad-
vantage of greasiness. “Near Bathurst,”
which Mr. Tatlock Miller has certified as
“Haefliger alone,” is a smudgy and rather
nightmarish landscape which certainly is
not Australian scenery.
“Christ at Emmaus” is small, dusky,
with blobs of bright color, rather like a
hasty impression of some of Justin
O’Brien’s Byzantine-like paintings—the
habit of calling things by their possible
influences is contagious. It is sufficient
to say that Haefliger’s art is, largely, de-
rivative and to pass on to Mr. Tatlock
Miller’s peroration:
The influences are many, but consciously,
wisely chosen and homage is reverently,
openly paid. And if the sudden smile is
yet only upon the face of this work, its
warmth already takes the chill from an
intellectual process, suggesting a happier
blossoming.
On analysis it seems, then, that
Haefliger’s work is not really calculated
to make even Mr. Tatlock Miller hop and
skip for joy. But it may, as Mr. Miller
hopes, lead to a later blossoming. And
then again it may not.
Socialism
“Laissez-faire” Liberalism may have
led to many abuses (B. 22/9/’4B), but it
differed from theoretical or pure Socialism
in one important respect —it worked.
And, as it worked, it could be adjusted
and improved.
True Socialism, on the other hand, has
never been known to work, and the
nation that tries it goes steadily downhill
till it turns to some sort of dictator to
pull it out of the mbss. That end has
arrived in Russia, and in Britain we can
see the process operating. Since the end
of the war, Britain has suffered a steady
industrial decline, particularly in indus-
tries that have been Socialised.
Now Stafford Cripps is in fact
economic dictator, and has introduced
measures that would be condemned as
“speeding up” if a “capitalist” suggested
them. From Russia he has copied, to
some extent, the idea of a legalised black-
market —the bare essentials of life are
rationed while many luxuries are coupon-
free but at prices so prohibitive (because
of luxury taxes) that only those who earn
far above the average can afford them.
But Cripps is caught in the toils of his
own system. High taxation, inseparable
from Socialism, dulls the edge of his in-
centives, and he may yet have to intro-
duce more drastic measures to make men
work. Fortunately, he seems to be, in
the British tradition, an unwilling
dictator, and his power may not survive
the emergency that called it forth.
Apologists for this sorry system point
to rising prices in America as proof of
the failure of capitalism. In that they
are grossly ungrateful. America certainly
got off lightly in the war, but the war
ended three years ago and cannot be
used as an excuse for ever. It is no co-
incidence that America, with her free
economy, has the greatest production per
head in the world. But a large propor-
tion of that production is being given
away free to those who, through mis-
fortune or mismanagement, cannot feed
themselves. Such large-scale generosity
implies considerable self-denial, and the
Americans are paying for it in rising
costs.
The U.S. defence programme, which
may again mean the difference between
life and death to us, adds to U.S. costs.
We have neither given away much since
the war nor spent much on defence, but
our prices are rising fast, and may eventu-
ally outstrip America if we cling much
longer to Socialism. — Heresone (Q.).
Liberal v. Labor
I, for one, don’t deplore the Liberal
party’s lack of a “vigorous policy” (B.
20/10/’4B). It is the absence of such a
policy of meddling and interference that
is really the characteristic, not only of
Liberals, but of all people who are
opposed to so-called Labor and its multi-
tude of “policy” schemes and “planning.”
What we want is a policy of non-
interference ; a negative policy or a “cold-
tea” policy if you like, but at least a
policy of permitting a man to plan his
own business, instead of having it planned
for him.
Some time ago I was travelling round
Victoria with the idea of buying a farm.
I called at one place in Gippsland where
300 tons of potatoes had been stacked in
pits all the winter because the farmer had
to wait for his official quota before
marketing each batch. A few weeks later
I was in a store in the Mallee. The store-
keeper told me he had had all his
customers on short rations of spuds
throughout the winter because of his
quota from the Potato Control Board!
\ Had that Gippsland farmer taken his
idle truck out of the shed and driven up
to the Mallee storekeeper with a load
of much-needed murphies he would have
been in more strife than the Manila
Girls. There are many more similar in-
stances of the result of Labor’s “vigorous
policy.”
When my grandfather came out from
Scotland 85 years ago and cleared the
virgin bush of Gippsland he did not have
a “vigorous policy” of Potato Boards,
Egg Boards, Milk Boards, etc., but he still
cleared the land, and though he lived to
89, he did not need the old-age pension
or any other of Labor’s wonderful social
services.
I’m conceited enough to think I inherit
some of the guts of my pioneering an-
cestors and that, along with a lot more
Australians, I can do more for myself and
this country if I’m left alone than I’ll ever
manage with the vigorous interference of
any Government. —P. C. M. (Vic.).
Victorian Mental Hospitals
’} Re “R.M.’s” remark (B. 20/10/’4B)
that the Victorian Mental Hospitals Com-
mittee’s report might be pigeonholed;
Health Minister Dunstan has already
introduced a bill in the Legislative
Assembly by which a three-man Mental
Hygiene Authority will replace the post
of Director of Mental Hygiene. He said,
rightly, that the task of dealing with
insanity had become too onerous for one
man. Members of the Authority will be
appointed for five years; a doctor will
be chairman.
The Authority’s functions will be: Im-
provement of treatment and prevention
of mental disease ; research into cause
and treatment; inspection and control of
private mental homes; reporting to the
Minister on welfare and accommodation
of patients; publication of reports and
information on mental disease ; mainten-
ance of mental institutions; and pro-
vision (with approval of the Minister) of
new accommodation, out-patient clinics,
after-care hostels, and clinics for retarded,
defective and problem children.
One clause provides that no female
attendant or nurse shall have charge of,
or attend, male patients except in special
circumstances. As the question is a very
live one at present, the bill has an excel-
lent chance of going through very quickly.
—Rodney Fisher (Vic.).
Wool and the Soil
How many graziers have any idea of the
amount of fertility removed from their
holdings when they send away a bale of
wool, a draft of fat cattle or a truck of
lambs? There are good grounds for be-
lieving that the loss of soil fertility under
ordinary management is greater where the
average annual rainfall is more than
20in., and that the loss diminishes pro-
portionately with the rainfall until, below
6in. a year, it is unnoticeable.
That would account for the beneficial
effects of drought in both sheep and
cattle country. Every experienced stock-
man knows that both cattle and sheep are
“Yes — I AM the phrenologist!”
healthier and. fatten more quickly after a
drought than before. He also knows that
in areas of continuously high rainfall
fleeces show a tendency to sogginess, lack
of life and less resistance to hard usage.
It is that quality of standing up to hard
usage on the machines and as finished
cloth that has made the name of Aus-
tralian-grown wool. To keep that good
name depends not so much on the manu-
facturer as the producer, who must never
forget the old saying “Half the breeding
goes down the throat.” Unless that half
is returned to the soil increasing deteriora-
tion is inevitable. — Woolly (N.S.W.).
Nurses
N. S. Wales Minister for Health, Mr.
Kelly, has announced that he is consider-
ing legislation to reduce the entrance age
of trainee nurses to 17. That won’t help
the profession much, A girl of 17, usually
fresh from school, is too young and in-
experienced to face the exacting work and
responsibilities of nursing.
Then there are the patients to consider.
When young girls come face tq face with
suffering, strict discipline and hard work,
the result is apt to be a very rapid
“toughening-up.” They tend to become
hard and unsympathetic, regarding their
work strictly as work, and their patients
only as a duty. No nurse could identify
herself with her patients without becom-
ing a nervous wreck, but she should be
able to retain her sympathy and respect
for the sick and suffering.
If Mr. Kelly wants to alter the entrance
age for trainee nurses, he would be better
advised to raise it to, say, 21. By that
time girls would be really certain that
they wanted to take up nursing, and
would have seen enough of life to realise
just what the job entails. — Mac (N.S.W.).
You can’t blame trade-unions and the
press for the shortage of nurses (B.
13/10//48), During the war, at a large
general hospital, most of the nursing
sisters had to put in papers for their com-
missions, and on these had to be stated
their education. The majority had only
passed the Qualifying Certificate or Q.C.
Sixth Class Primary School, and very
few had the Intermediate Certificate,
That does not fit in with “W.P.T.’s” con-
tention that “a big percentage of them
come from wealthy and near-wealthy
homes.”
The main reason for the lack of nurses
is fear of the so-called discipline in hos-
pitals. Autocratic matrons wield too
much power over the lives of the young
girls. Today there are many avenues
open to ambitious young women, and the
idea of “deriving satisfaction from their
work” went out with bowler hats. Nurs-
ing is just another job, no matter how
much has been written about the
“glamor” of it, and it is not attractive.
There is too much drudgery in the
early years and trainees are only cheap
labor. What has floor-washing, scrubbing
and pan-carrying to do with nursing the
sick? These are the things which girls
prefer to avoid, and, as “W.P.T.” says,
“there are better conditions and bigger
wages in a jam factory.” And in hun-
dreds of other occupations.—R. W.
(N.S.W.).
The Root of the Matter
I’ve just sent a food parcel to Britain
containing 12s. 6d. worth of food. Post-
age was ss. 6d. and half a yard of calico
another Is. 6d. Another small parcel
containing 7s. 3d. worth of food went for
about 3s. sd. plus Is. 6d. for calico.
There could be no better use for part of
the £46,000,000 surplus Commonwealth
revenue than the subsidising of postage on
food parcels.— Mac (N.S.W.).
Our shops are full of British goods, we
drive about in 'British motor-cars and
now British prefabricated homes are to
ease our housing shortage. That’s all
good for Britain’s export drive, of course,
but what a reflection on the condition of
Australian industry! Britain, despite her
own reconstruction programme, can still
come to the aid of a Dominion which
suffered practically no bomb damage.—
D.R.I. (N.S.W.).
Some time ago my, firm sent me from
Sydney to a country branch in western
N. S. Wales. I’d had the phone on in
Sydney and the P.M.G. people said that
it could easily be transferred to my new
address within two or three weeks. After
14 months they announced that they’d be
round to instal it, but by that time I’d
been transferred to the North Coast.
More form-filling and the promise that the
phone would soon follow me to the new
address. I’ve been here for three months
now and I’m still waiting.—G. P. D.
(N.S.W.).
“Hadley Propsting” (B. 27/10/’4B)
complains of high probate costs. He
should be interested to know that in-
heritance taxes have been abolished in
socialist U.S.S.R. —D. C. (Tas.).
Although butter is still severely
rationed large quantities of whole milk
—normally separated to produce cream
for butter manufacture—are being sold
for the manufacture of ice-cream and
other milk products. Cobargo Co-opera-
tive Creamery Company, on the N. S.
Wales South Coast, for instance, has
arranged to supply an ice-cream firm with
2000 gallons of whole milk weekly. A
move has also been made to establish a
milk-processing factory at Bega, which
means that butter production must be
affected. Farmers, of course, cannot be
blamed if they are offered a higher return
for less work, but something will have to
be done about the price paid to dairy-
men for their butter, so that it pays them
at least as well to produce butter as it
does to produce milk for ice-cream and
other products.—W. P. T. (N.S.W.).
