“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonparell
Illustrated Newspaper.
** The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Ib the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians. —The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Rank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System-one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by 'the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form —printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the cl a’ms of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
tothebushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongiest -proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another,
i The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations Ihe cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
I straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
! public.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. M. A. GUMMING,
of Tarraville, Victoria, Australia, says s
“About a year ago, I had a severe attack
of Influenza, which left me very weak, with-
out energy, appetite, or interest in life.
Obtaining little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recommended to
me, I finally tried Ayer's Sarsaparilla and.
K
/*T
from that time, I began to gain health and
strength. I continued the treatment until
fully recovered, and now have very great
pleasure in telling my friends of the merits
of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and the happy re-
sults of its use. I consider it the best blood-
purifier known.”

Editor Bulletin, —You say : “ Glorious
Waterloo was fought on the blessed Sawbath.”
So were Dunbar and Worcester, when the Coven-
anters got specially glorious drubbings.-—J.B.
Dear Bulletin, —Your advice that jurie B
dole out their own mercy and trust neither Judg e
nor Executive, hits the nail on the head. That ha s
been our view up here for some Six year B
ago I served on a N.Q. jury which tried a young
clerk for embezzling -£3. The charge was proved
to the hilt. The Judge was brief; the jury’s
course was clear. They didn’t take it. They
acquitted the accused, whose conduct ever since
has been at least as edifying as if he had been
branded a gaol-bird or had spent 12 months on a
plank-bed.— Jim Crow, C.Q.
In an address recently made before the
Chambre Syndicate des Produits Chimiques in
Paris, Mr. Berthelot proposes to utilize the central
heat of the earth by sinking a shaft or shafts to a
depth of 4000 metres. At the bottom of these
shafts he believes that a temperature of 160° to
200° Cent, would be found, and the pressure
developed could be used for running machinery.
M. Berthelot believes also thafat this depth we
would reach a source of thermo-electric energy
almost without limit.
Wilhelm 11., says an English paper, is not
so tender-hearted to criminals as his august grand-
father, who had an attack of neuralgia and a
series of bad nights as soon as he had signed a
death-warrant. During his reign of 27 years as
King of Prussia and German Empetor, only 2r3
executions took place, and no woman was sent to
the block, the guillotine not being used in Ger-
many. But, since William the Strong’s accession
to the throne, 126 criminals have already suffered
death, out of whom eight were women. The
present executioner is a gentleman called Herr
Reindel, and, as in the case of a favourite actor,
as he performed last week his hundredth execution,
numerous telegrams of congratulation were sent
him from various parts of the kingdom to
Gleinitz, where the interesting solemnity was to
take place. An hour before the execution he
received as a token of felicitation and good wishes a
superb basket of Marechal Kiel roses; one of
them he put in his buttonhole, the others were
placed next to him on the scaffold.
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by
Sharp’s new “Cannalin” treatment, large quan-
tities of which are being forwarded to sufferers
throughout the colonies. It is obtainable, with
advice, from 257 George-street, Sydney.
At Melbourne Democratic Club’s seventh
annual dinner, held on 4th July, 150 hungry
democrats sat down. Once a year this much-alive
institution lays itself out for a birthday spree, and
each year does' it better than the time before.
There was a free-and-easy dress-as-you-please air
about the affair, a solidity about the victuals, and
an absence of a lot of the usual silly, meaningless
toasts. Little Dr. Maloney was greeted with
“ Hello, Bill,” from all parts when he arrived, and
Hancock with “ What price, Jack?” while Tren-
with, who daily grows more like a well-con-
ditioned duck, waddled in amidst subdued
applause, which seemed to say that 1 at is a crime.
It came out that the club was started seven years
ago by five thirsty revolutionaires who wanted to
get a drink one Sunday, and either couldn t, or, if
they could, didn’t like the sneak-thief fashion in
which they were forced to do it. That quintette
thereupon formed the Democratic Club, whose
roll-call has multiplied up to the number of 550.
The club, it seems, has, according to President
Ellis, four distinct varieties of enemies. The
Sabbatarians snort at it because it holds Sunday-
morning boxing contests and Sunday-evening
concerts ; the teetotallers because it, like all other
clubs, sells liquor to members on all days and at
all hours; the licensed victuallers for the same
reason ; and all right-thinking persons because it
is a strong anti-fat influence, and makes possession
of an elector’s right a sine qua non of membership.
Some good songs, &c., were more or less mal-
treated during the evening; among them was
“The man who broke the bank,” See., sung by a
genius who had the temerity to don the horrified
Trenwith’s shiny belltopper and assume his silver-
mounted walking-stick for theatrical effect. Much
of the success was due to‘the fact that the gold-
spectacled and necktieless Jos. Symes at frequent
intervals during the proceedings interjected
“H’ah, h’ah.”

With an ordinary tape measure determuie the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CO,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the loot on a sheet of papM. and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS is,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bootmaking is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.

comfortable impedimenta. All boots made on specially-

A Strange Old Law.
The civil and criminal codes of Australia are
remarkable, not so much for what has been
deliberately put into them as for what the
local law-rnakers have forgotten to take out
of them. When Australia had its first
beginnings it took over, in one solid mass,
the statute law of England, and as much of
that law was obsolete, semi-obsolete or
practically forgotten this country did not
know, and doesn’t know to this day, what it
really did take over on that memorable occa-
sion. Old, dead, mouldy statutes which few
living men ever heard of lie about like loose
boards in the dark, and no one knows of
their existence till, once in a decade or so,
someone steps by accident on the end of the
hidden thing, and it rises up suddenly
and hits him in the eye amidst the ob-
scurity. Even on these occasions, however,
no Government makes any serious effort to
remove the obstruction. Governments,
as a rule, find great advantage in the present
hap hazard system. 'I he Cabinet, through
the medium of the Attorney-General and
the Crown Law Department, is virtually the
power which sets the law in motion, or allows
it to remain motionless, as the case may be.
There are existing, within its knowledge,
but without the knowledge of the general
public, scores of ancient, musty, barbarous
enactments which forbid, under heavy
penalties, hundreds of things of the illegality
of which the community has no semblance of
an idea. In 999 cases out of every thousand
the transgressors of these laws pass abso-
lutely unnoticed. But now and then some
person of obnoxious political or religious or
social views does what the other 999 have
done unnoticed, and then the law—of which
he is ignorant entirely through the premedi-
tated neglect of the authorities to enforce it
—is put in motion suddenly and with crush-
ing severity. He is the person who steps on
the loose board in the dark, and the law’s
administrators, who deliberately led him to
believe the board was sound, leave him to
take the consequences.
• • »
The latest victim of this man-trap and
spring-gun policy is J. A. Andrews, of
Sydxxey, who, being unable to pay a fine of
£2O, was sent, a few days ago, to gaol for
three months for selling an imprintless
pamphlet. Andrews is well-known as an
anarchist—about the most peaceful and in-
offensive anarchist who ever sought to con-
vert an aggressive world from the evil of its
ways. His pamphlet advocated anarchism
from an entirely peaceful standpoint ; it
was as devoid of all tendency towards blood-
shed and “ lawlessness ” as a tea-meeting or
a gathering of the Peace Society ; and it was
objectionable simply because nobody read
it, but everybody assumed, without read-
ing it, that it advocated dynamite and incen-
diarism, bombs, murder and sudden death.
Also, it actually did bear an imprint which
read as follows : “ Issued by J. A. Andrews,
late of Mudgee, and now of 491 Elizabeth-
street, Sydney.” As the object of the
imprint is simply to enable the authorities,
in the case of any publication which con-
travenes the law, to fix upon the person
responsible for its appearance, this fully
answered all requirements. It answered
them, in fact, much more fully than a tech-
nically legal imprint would have done, for
that merely gives the name of the printer, a
mechanical person who puts another man’s
offence into type without realising its full
import, while Andrews’ imprint took upon
himself the responsibility for the authorship
as well as all other matters. Nevertheless,
because he inadvertently neglected to give
the name and address of the artisan who set
the type, the dead and forgotten law was set
in motion with the above result.
• * •
If the said law, however tyrannical it may
be, was equally administered, there would
be little to complain of. But how unequally
it is administered can be guessed by a study
of its provisions. It requires, among other
things, that the printer of any paper or book
whatsoever, whether meant to be sold or
given away, shall put thereon the name of
the town or city wherein he resides, and the
name of the street, lane, court or place in
that town in which he has his dwelling place
or usual abode. This elaborate statement is
to appear on the front of every paper which
consists of one leaf only, and in the case of a
publication which contains more than one
leaf it must appear both on the front and
last leaves. There are a few unimportant
exceptions to the rule, such as bank notes,
bills of exchange, bonds, and the like, but
everything, excepting newspapers, which
can be included under the term literature in
its widest sense, is subject to its provisions.
As regards newspapers, even more elaborate
restrictions come into operation. The
number of documents which must be filled
up, of affidavits which must be written,
signed, sworn, attested and filed with
various officials, and the number of formali-
ties which must be complied with before one
copy of a paper can be lawfully issued is so
vast and elaborate that, in all reasonable pro-
bability, there are not, at the present time, a
dozen legally issued newspapers in New
South Wales. Also, there is, in all human
probability, not one book or pamphlet among
every ten that are published in the province,
which does not make the publisher, the
seller, and even the person who gives it
away to a friend, liable to a fine of £2O for
each individual copy.
* » *
These regulations apply to books and
papers published in the province. The same
law, however, covers —most likely without
any knowledge or intention on the part of
any one concerned—all imported papers in
its elaborate provisions, and does it in
so fearful and wonderful a fashion that,
as an able Sydney barrister long ago
informed The Bulletin, every separate in-
dividual who sells any British or other
foreign paper is, in all probability, liable to
an enormous penalty for every copy sold or
offered to the public. Also, in all likelihood,
the individual who gives away any such
paper is equally liable. These penalties may
be recovered by anyone who likes to take
proceedings, and it is only the general
ignoi’ance of the law, through its constant
non-enforcement, which prevents a whole-
sale and profitable trade being doxie in the
matter. The same statute makes every
person virtually a special constable for the
purposes of the Act, and authorises him to
seize and drag before a J.P. any individual
selling,- delivering, offering or exposing for
sale any paper or book which does not com-
ply with all the regulations made and pro-
vided —which practically means that any
person may seize and arrest any newsagent,
bookseller or publisher in the province.
• # *
This nefarious law is allowed to exist
simply because it is hardly ever enforced,
but while it does exist it enables the Govern-
ment to crush small and uninfluential poli-
tical opponents almost at its discretion. It
was enforced with brutal severity in the case
of the unfortunate Andrews and his harm-
less pamphlet, which pamphlet did bear an
imprint, though a technically insufficient
one ; it is not enforced in the case of the
National Ass, which, at the very same time,
was publicly circulating political leaflets with
no imprint whatever. Also it is nevei 1 , by
any chance, enforced in the case of any big,
influential paper, or any “right-thinking”
publication of any kind whatsoever. The
Government, in fact, takes it upon itself to
decide when the law must be obeyed and
when it may be broken with impunity, and
it always decides that it may be broken with
impunity by the rich, or influential, or
respectable, or obtrusively “ right-think-
ing ” person, and by no other. Under
such circumstances, the so-called “liberal
institutions ” of the country are a de-
lusion and a mockery. The Government
which can practically abrogate laws at its
own pleasure is as autocratic as the Govern-
ment which can make laws at its own plea-
sure. It is the business of the legal
authorities to enforce the law as it stands,
and in its entirety, until it is amended by
Parliament, and it has no more right to
condone the offence of the man who issues
National Ass manifestoes without an imprint
than it has to condone the offence of the
man who commits murder.

The surest and most speedy way to-
wards the abolition of the multitude
of tyrannous old statutes which Australia
inherited from its English forefathers is the
formation of a democratic association to
secure their constant enforcement. If such
an associatioxx were formed, with abundant
funds subscribed by the democracy, with the
best legal talent which could be procured,
and with an army of informers paid strictly
by results, it could, under capable manage-
ment, achieve wonders. Its business would
be to hunt up every old, wicked, forgotten
enactment on the statute-book and enforce
it to the bitter end against all classes, its
owxx included. If the brutal Sabbatarian
law were so executed against every shop-
keeper, every railway and tram official, every
rich man’s coachman and flunkey, everyone,
in short, who breaks the Day of Rest and
who can possibly be dragged into the
net, the whole business of the inferior courts
would be blocked by the incalculable mul-
titude of offenders, and a special sessioxx of
Parliament would be called in red-hot haste to
deal with the matter. If the law under which
Andrews was convicted were enforcedagainst
every printer and publisher in the land,
from the owner of the biggest daily paper
down to the dispenser of theatrical pro-
grammes at the door of a tenth-rate “gaff,”
its radical reform would be achieved within
a month. The same process would apply to
every other such enactment on the statute-
book. And, possibly, while digging among
the debris of the musty past, some forgotten
law might be discovered which prescribes an
appropriate punishment for those authorities
who are paid to enforce the law ixx its
entirety, yet only enforce it at their own
pleasure and convenience. Then the Crown
Law authorities who prosecuted Andrews
for a technically deficient imprint might be
prosecuted—and perhaps gaoled—in their
turn for their glaring and culpable failure to
prosecute the National Ass magnates on
similar grounds. Considering that the
National Ass has included all the members
of the New South Wales Government in its
published list of candidates, the neglect of
the authorities to proceed against it for its
recent breach of the law relating to publica-
tions looks especially significant.
Caesar’s Column.
When Ignatius Donnelly wrote the grue-
some tale of prophecy which he entitled
“ Caesar’s Column,” it is questionable if one
person in a hundred thousand took him
seriously, or regarded him as anything save
a grotesque romancer. His story of the
destruction of a whole world’s civilisation
—of a general upheaval of the Goths and
Huns throughout the entire globe, and their
frantic resolve to leave not one brick upon
another of all the works of man —seemed too
vast and purposeless ever to become even the
semblance of a reality. Yet the doings of
the last few weeks in the United States have
brought that semblance of a reality appre-
ciably closer, and the tale of Caesar’s Column
has come near to being enacted on a micro-
scopic scale at Chicago and various other
cities. It failed, partly because the Caesar
himself was wanting, and without him the
uprising was merely a frenzy of disconnected
atoms with no leader and no central organis-
ation worthy of the name ; and partly
because the time, like the Caesar, had
not arrived. The incubus of capitalism has
grown so heavy that 200,000 men or more
were ready and willing to declare a war of
annihilation against the dominant caste, and
to raze to the ground everything which syrm
bolised its hated existence. If the present
order of things endures, it is only a matter
of time and arithmetical progression until
20,000,000 men are ready to take up the
same cause. Then, providing the Uesar is
forthcoming, the prophecy of Ignatius
Donnelly will be fulfilled. The rioters who
held Chicago last week only wanted
as their leader one iconoclast of com-
manding intellect, and they would pro-
bably have laid the pork city in ashes.
If the same causes which called them
into existence continue to operate, the next
century may see an uprising which will
desolate the land from Panama to the St.
Lawrence, and give every combustible thing
in the United States to the flames.

The American Union is now, without ex-
ception, the richest State upon this earth.
Also, it has more millionaires than any other
nation in all the five continents, and it has
brought the doctrine of private enterprise to
a degree of perfection unknown in any other
civilised country. By reason of its policy of
private enterprise it is par excellence the land
of rail way-wreckers, stock-jobbers, fraudu-
lent syndicates, bowelless corporations, and
financial robbers of every kind and degree.
It has at one end of the scale the richest pluto-
cracy on earth; at the other a vast army of
tramps, paupers, anarchists and all manner of
frozen-out waifsand strays of humanity. When
it has ceased to be a “ new country ” —when
there is no longer a West as an escape-valve
for the crowded East, and the vacant lands
are all occupied, and the curse of private
enterprise has spread all over the union—
then it wiH have more tramps and more
anarchists than any other country on the
face of this sorrowful globe. The same
causes which have multiplied millionaires
and paupers in the past will, unless they are
remedied, multiply billionaires and paupers
in the future. And, meanwhile, the great
middle class which fills the gap between
these two extremes is being eaten up by
competition and private enterprise, And will
continue to be eaten up, while the present
system lasts, with increasing velocity. And,
as it declines, the time steadily approaches
when the Astors and the Vanderbilts will
be hanged by the coming Caesar in Madison
Square, and a war of extermination will be
declared against the whole scheme of
society.
# * #
The situation’ of the United States is a
strange and wonderful anomaly. There is
more wealth to be plundered there than, in
any other country. There is more corrup-
tion and more robbery by the processes of
private enterprise than in any other allegedly
civilised land. The aristocracy of wealth,
whose very existence is a perpetual challenge
to the ever-increasing masses of the poor, is
wealthier and more arrogant and more
garish in its brutal magnificence than any-
where else between the two poles. There is
more education, to teach the masses what
they are and what they might be, than in
the great majority of countries. The burden
of capitalism weighs more heavily on the
people than it does even in Europe And yet
the only reliable foi'ce which stands between
the plutocracy and utter destruction is some-
thing less than 30,000 indifferently -dis-
ciplined Federal troops. The militia of the
various States has been called out over and
over again to quell labour disturbances, and
has almost invariably refused to take action
in defence of “ law and order.” The habit
of military obedience was just sufficiently
strong in this citizen soldiery to prevent it
openly joining the insurrectionists, but, as a
rule, it has stood aloof and regarded the
insurrection with cheerful indifference. The
handful of Federal soldiers is actually the
only force which compels 60,000,000 people
to submit to the exactions of the most bowel-
less, the most aggressive, and probably the
most ruinous financial oligarchy upon eanh.
The whole system is an inverted pyramid
balanced upon its apex ; yet, though it is
always tottering, somehow or other its
fall is long postponed. In Europe, far less
burdensome tyrannies are propped up by
500,000 bayonets, and exist only because
some genius of bygone days discovered
that man is so subservient to mere habit that
he only needs to be drilled for a while,
according to a certain cast-iron formula, and
dressed in a blue or grey or red uniform, and
he will fight to the bitter end on behalf of
his slave-driver against his own class. But
in America the governing class has discovered
that men can be kept in slavery to syndicates
and corporations by the mere habit of
believing that they are free, and, therefore,
the Astors and the Vanderbilts have not
begun to dangle in Madison square—not as
yet.
# # •
Still, granted a continuance of the present
conditions, and the greatest and most deso-
lating Labour war in history will have to be
fought out in the United States sooner or
later. For the masses there is no visible
means of redress save by force. The
States have practically manhood suffrage;
but the machinery of the two great political
parties is so complete and far-reaching chat
the country has merely the barren privilege
of deciding whether Democrats or Repub-
licans shall hold office. The “bosses” of
these two factions maintain a feeble pretence
of differing about certain small points con-
nected with the tariff, so as to give to the
nation the erroneous impression that it has
a voice in deciding how it shall be governed,
but, in reality, the popular decision decides
nothing of any moment. The parties are
equally bought and owned by rings and
trusts and corporations, and the Govern-
ment, like the country, is run by private
enterprise. It will probably take twenty
years of organisation to create a dominant
People’s Party, as opposed to the two par-
ties of capital, and when it is created its
leaders will be bought by the almighty dollar
like the rest. Nowhere in all the world
is private enterprise so supreme as in
the States; it owns everything, even
the national suffrage ; it runs prac-
tically everything, from the Government
and the courts of justice downwards ; and it
is everywhere. The Labour movement in
America is practically a war against this
joint-stock incubus, and that, to all intents
and purposes, means that it is a war against
the whole local civilisation. To abolish the
present system of capitalism by violence is


to leave hardly one brick standing on another
throughout the Union. And to abolish it
otherwise than by violence seems just now a
very far-off possibility indeed.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Painful Business.
In Melbourne Banco Court, the other day, the
legatees under the will of Charles Ibbotson,
of Geelong, applied for an order to compel their
trustees to make good a deficiency of £5400 in
the estate. Said trustees were a pair of soli-
citors (formerly in partnership) and an un-
fortunate surgeon, who had been pressed into
the job by the heirs of Ibbotson, for the pur-
pose, no doubt, of keeping an eye upon the two
lawyers. The blame for the £5400 deficiency
appears to rest with one only of these profes-
sional caretakers. More than half of the
money was paid into their partnership account
by the defaulting worthy, “and has not been ac-
counted for. ” In plain English, one of the lawyers
was alleged to have lost or pocketed all the
missing money, and, as he made no defence
in the case, his profound silence is ominous.
Nevertheless, he is, or was lately, seen about
Melbourne, looking quite easy in his legal mind.
If a trustee, who isn’t a lawyer, pays other
people’s cash into his account and fails to pro-
duce it when called upon, he runs an excellent
risk of going to gaol. The difference between
a shortage in the cash of a trustee and a
shortage in the cash of a bank-teller is im-
perceptible in such a case, A lawyer, however, has
seemingly a license from the law to be short in his
cash with impunity. Judge Holroyd referred
to the delinquency in question as a “painful
business,” chiefly painful, possibly, because it
attracted further public notice to the disre-
putable condition of the legal brotherhood.
The word “fraud,” or a mention of criminal
proceedings, was never spoken in Court,
or if spoken, was certainly not reported
by the press. No “great” newspaper ex-
posed the full dimensions of this disgraceful
scandal, and nothing appeared to come of the
action beyond an order that accounts should be
taken. “ Further directions and the question
of costs would be reserved.” The Judge
couldn’t even make up his mind right away
that the trustees should pay costs, though he
was prepared to “relieve” two of them (in-
cluding the lawyer who didn’t account for the
missing cash) for continuing their duties to the
estate. As regards the unknown “ other direc-
tions,” it is probable that they will not include
a direction to seriously prosecute the cronk
attorney.
The Conspiracy Farce.
A few days since a Melbourne importer, one
J. K. Megredy, was acquitted on a charge of
conspiracy to defraud a French manufacturing
firm of a large sum of money, the proceeds of
“account sales.” The French firm’s goods had
been sold, and the cash for them was not forth-
coming. Practically, it was, prima facie, a
case of embezzlement of goods. Megredy, not
being the whole of the Melbourne agency house
himself, was charged with conspiracy with his
partners to rob their foreign principals, but the
said partners were not present. The Crown
prosecuted Megredy only, in the absence of the
other gentlemen, and the Crown counsel having
clearly shown that the French traders were
mulct of £9OOO, told the jury that an acquittal
would indicate that fraud was a recognised
business custom in Melbourne. The significance
of the barrister’s peroration was intensified by
Judge A’Beckett’s comment upon it. His
Honor was glad to have an opportunity of
informing the jury that “ a verdict of acquittal
in this case would not indicate any low tone of
commercial morality, or indifference to the
frauds which, according to the evidence for the
prosecution, were committed by Mr. Megredy.”
Mr. A’Beckett was not virtuously indignant;
he didn’t spurn the thought that Melbourne’s
financial morality was already open to grave
suspicion, he simply devoted himself to a legal
explanation of how Megredy might be dis-
charged without a stain upon the jury’s
character. In other words, the Judge under-
took the not very pleasant duty of showing that
another Crown prosecution was qualified to
end in a hair-raising fiasco. Hear Justice
A’Beckett addressing the jury :
According to the evidence of the prosecution, Mr.
Megredy committed certain frauds as to which you may
entertain the strongest feelings, and perhaps the strongest
desire to punish, but what Mr. Megredy is being tried for
in-this case is not for committing certain frauds himself,
for which he is personally amenable to justice, but he is
being tried for another offence, as to which, but for their
absence, others would stand in that dock and have to
plead as he pleaded to that charge. He is charged with
the offence of combining and conspiring with others to
do certain things, and, however bad those things are, if
you think that others did not combine with him to do
them, he escapes, not by reason of his own innocence, but
by reason of the fact that you are not convinced of the
guilt of others,
And much more to the same effect. The more
guilty Megredy, the more he must be let off,
explained the Judge, and the jury, after two
hours’ deliberation, found that they had no
proof of the guilt of others, therefore Macredy
was acquitted. The Crown authorities had
charged him with conspiracy, and so the case
failed, as other conspiracy cases have failed
before this. And it is difficult to avoid the idea
that Judge A’Beckett’s summing-up must have
seemed to the jury very like a legal apology for
the failure of conspiracy prosecutions in
general. The most unsatisfactory feature of this
strange business had yet to come, however.
Two or three days after Megredy’s acquittal
the Argus, for reasons that may be guessed at,
published the full text of the Judge’s summing-
up. In another column of the same issue was
printed a letter from Megredy commencing—
“ When you publish on Monday the whole of
Mr. Justice A’Beckett’s charge to the jury.”
Megredy somehow knew that the Argus
intended to direct public attention to the pecu-
liarities of this case, and was ready with a
letter in defence of what he knew would be
roughly estimated as a miscarriage of justice.
The Bulletin strongly recommends Mr.
Megredy, who has been acquitted on a techni-
cality in the conspiracy charge, to demand an
individual trial, in order that his character may
be decisively cleared.
The Pope or Lemonade?
Editor Bulletin. —Pascal and others have
complimented the R.C. Church upon its faculty
of being all things to all men—and women. It
leads, not drives, its votaries. While giving
due prominence to Hell, it does not make a joy-
less life the condition of Heaven. It has allow-
ances for feeble Human nature. Protestantism
insists upon the whole hog; Catholicism is
satisfied with a little bit to begin with. It
humours the individual, suits its doctrine to
circumstances, and makes the punishment
fit, not the crime, but the criminal.
Hence the prosperity which the Protestant
sects are never tired of envying. If a man
must have a creed, self-interest should surely
make him a Catholic, since then he can have a
good time in both worlds ; while to be a good
Protestant it is necessary to mortify the flesh,
and accept “ skim-milk here for the sake of
butter beyond the clouds.” It is Calvin and
Knox, not Escobar and Liguori, who would
rob us of our pleasant little vices.
How often do you hear a priest raving
for prohibition ? But, all the same, a
gentle suasive influence is continually being
exercised on the drunkard ; and not Catholic,
but Protestant countries, are the most drunken.
In which Austialasian province is the success
[i.e., the failure) of prohibition most probable ?
In Maoriland. In which province is Catholic-
ism least powerful ? In Maoriland. In which
province is prohibition least probable ? In
Queensland. In which is Catholicism most
powerful ? In Queensland. Here are some
1891 census figures of population :
Maoriland, 13"9 per cent. Catholics—most prohibitionist*
S. Australia, 14‘7 „ ~ —next most.
Tasmania, 17'6 „ ~
Victoria, 21 - 8 „ „
Westraha, 25'3 „ I next least.
N.S. Wales, 25'5 „ ~ (
Queensland, 53‘6 ~ ~ —least prohibitionist.
The classification is a matter of common know-
ledge, so far as made, and probably the grada-
tion of fanaticism could be extended through
Tasmania and Victoria. Anyhow, the tendency
is obvious. Prohibition is driving Australia
into the arms of Rome. In proportion as
human nature revolts against the repression of
the natural man, so will Catholicism triumph.
When Australians are called upon to choose be-
tween the Pope and lemonade, they will shout
with one voice for the Pope.—Yours, B.

The Odious Afghan.
Dear Bulletin, —You quote Major Leonard
to the effect that “ the Afghan is the dirtiest
brute on record.” Is he dirtier than other
Eastern races ? He is certainly braver than
most. History has praised his mettle ever
since he fought with Darius at Arbela ; and,
though Alexander conquered him, the English
could not. He has defied half-a-dozen Rourke
larrikins to come on all at once—and in vain.
There is a common white-skin prejudice against
“ the dirty blacks ” ; but it is astonishing what
a number of whites contrive to get along with-
out a bath from New Year to Christmas. Lots
of women have only bathed on their wedding-
day ; lots of men are never wet all over at once
till they are laid out for the grave. And,
as a Bulletin correspondent pointed out
recently, “ it’s no use a man being white
unless he’s white inside.” The cry of
“Australia for the white man!” has made
a lot of mean whites look upon themselves
as the salt of the earth. When the Afghans at
Bourka had a festival lately, they killed a
number of sheep and bullocks, and distributed
meat, tea, sugar and flour among these gentry.
It would have surprised you to see how many
proud mean whites rolled up to take the black
man’s bounty. A number of white families are
living on the Afghans now, and taking the
scraps from their camps. Every Sunday night
some of the womenkind of Bourke (high and
low) come to see the Afghans dancing and
enjoying themselves. A carrier’s wife here has
been employed for some time past in making
calico suits for them at 3s, per suit, they find-
ing materials. The other day a local publican’s
wife offered to do them for 2s. The mean
Afghans would not accept the offer. I don’t
like the Afghan; he cannot mix with us ; in
some things he is a bit too good for us ; and I
think he is better out of the country ; but he is
more honest and manly than many of those
who jeer at him. —Yours, Billabong,
Gunny Khan, an Afghan camel-owner, pub-
lishes a remarkable letter in the Central
Australian (Bourke). Some extracts :
When camels were introduced, a great outcry was made
by a certain section of carriers, who said that, if allowed
to come in any great number, the camels would run the
horse and bullock teams off the roads. The Carriers’
Union was then in existence, by-laws and s hedule of
rates being fixed, and I made application to be allowed to
join the union. 1 offered, if they allowed me to join, to
bind myself not to introduce any more camels, and, fur-
ther, to inform other Afghans that it would be no use
their bringing camels to Bourke, as they would not find
sufficient "work for them. Even this promise would
not satisfy, and I warned them that I would
use all efforts to introduce more camels into the
district, and, it possible, smash their union. I then
induced Abdul Wadk to join me, and shortly afterwards
he and M. Green, who afterwards became my partner,
brought over some 120 camels from South Australia ;
eventually, Abdul Wade w r ent to India and brought over
some 350 camels, and to-day I have the satisfaction of
knowing the Carriers’ Union is no more, nor, as far as I
can glean, is there any possibility of its being resuscitated.
. . . It may seem somewhat ambiguous to say that I
have felt sorry for some of the carriers leaving, but they
had no one to blame but their union. I have always tried
to act justly to all parties, squatters, carriers and others,
and it they only acted justly to me, they would have
found I had not such a bad heart—in fact, I have always
opened my purse-strings for any charity or other good
cause for the benefit of Bourke. I have, of late, kept my
camels here simply out of spite: there are plenty of
other places in Australia where I can get as good a living
as here, if not a far better one ; and that is solely why I
am leaving. The Camel is a long-legged animal and can
cover an enormous distance within a short space of time.
If there comes any difficulty here and the squatters do
not support the camel-owners there might he a probability
of their clearing out and leaving them to the mercy of
the carriers.
This gives scope for hard thinking. Evidently
an Afghan’s head has brains in it.
J. M. Davies, brother of St. Matthew of that
ilk, lately furnished the Vic. Council with a
piece of his mind concerning the reckless ex-
penditure of public sympathy upon widows.
Previous speakers had inclined to think that
widows needed protection in financial matters
—a certain amount of shielding from trustees
and so forth, but Matthew’s brother denounced
these ideas as maudlin sentiment. Widows are
evidently a sore point with the busted-bank
crowd and their respectable admirers. They
wish to hear no more concerning the lone, lorn
female who was advised to place her dividends
to her credit instead of taking them out, and
who now goes around wondering why she can’t
get any money at all. She is a vastly over-
rated sufferer, it appears, and references
to her general bad luck ought to cease.
Indeed, references to all such foolish outsiders
as have lost money, and seem likely to start
losing money again when “ confidence” returns,
are absurd. They are likewise very wounding
to the feelings of financiers, who regret, “ no
one more deeply” (judicial gag) that they have
brought grief to —er —themselves. Under these
circumstances The Bulletin calls for silence
on the topic of the widow and the fatherless,
and the retired tradesman, who commits suicide
in commemoration of his departed savings.
Cheerfulness and contentment, and determina-
tion to look at the bright side of things that are
black all round, these are the proper things to
talk about. For the rest, silence. Hssh !
MTntyrb, Minister of Lands, treated Vic.
Assembly last week to a statement of the case
against Affleck Robertson, the philanthro-
pist who has made such a to-do about the
squelching of his Village Settlement. Mac. in
effect said that Robertson had tried to “ work”
the settlement business for his own advertise-
ment. Having got a few men on the land, and
turned a few others off it, dictator Robertson
wanted to “act in a OiiRiST-like manner,” and
“do his best for everybody (D.V.).” MTntyre
carried the House with him by saying, “ Then
my suspicions were aroused.” The rest of the
speech was superfluous. For the person of
CHRiST-like tendencies, genuine or otherwise,
there is no sympathy in the Vic. Parliament
unless he happens to be a member of either
House, like James Balfour. The Bulletin
must also admit a grave doubt concerning one
who writes “ (D.V.).” The great heart of this
journal has never yet throbbed for a member of
the “(D.V.) ” family. Besides, Christ, in this
case, desired first-class railway-passes for him-
self and wife, and only second-class tickets for
the disciples.
*
Wynne’s well-meaning bill to amend the Com-
panies Act has reached the Victorian Assembly
after being considerably emasculated by
“ boom ” sympathisers in the Council, where it
first saw the light. One of these Council
alterations is shockingly humorous. Wynne
proposed to make auditors certify their opinion
as to a balance-sheet being “ so drawn up as to
exhibit a true and correct view of the com-
pany’s affairs.” The Council passed this clause
with a few additional words—“ as shown in
the books of the eompany.” Any lie written
in the precious books is to be read as truth by the
auditors, and duly authenticated. And howabout
the directors who maintain a false appearance of
ignorance by not looking in the books, where
the lies that they know to be lies are recorded ?
The Mercantile Bank books, for instance,
assumed the solvency of Daviesian companies
by taking their worthless shares in among the
good debts, and Davies was too busy to look
at the little mistake. In that case the auditors
saw that all was right “by the books,” whilst
the chairman wouldn’t, or didn’t, see that all
was wrong by the same volumes. No amended
Act will be worth much if it doesn’t make
directors responsible for such knowledge of a
company’s affairs as they must happen to
possess whether they look in the books or not.
The symptoms arising from the action of irritant
poisons, among which are arsenic and antimony,
are almost identical with those proceeding from
cholera, diarrhoea, colic, gastritis, enteritis,
ulceration, and other disorders of the intestines.
Similarly the characteristics of poisoning by
narcotics and neurotics, which include opium,
prussic acid, chloroform, and strychnine, are
difficult to distinguish from those of apoplexy,
epilepsy, tetanus, convulsions, and other cere-
bral diseases. Also, it is possible for a person
to die from the mere shock of a poison’s sudden
action, and, without evincing any symptoms of
poisoning, present all the appearance of having
succumbed to syncope proceeding from valvular
or other disease of the heart. When it is a fact
that in Victoria, for example, about 2000
deaths per annum are ascribed to the diseases
enumerated ; when further it is considered how
many in a million have motives for desiring the
death of certain of their fellows; and, finally,
when it is reflected that the medical profession,
like every other class, has its share of born
fools, whom no amount of education or experi-
ence can ever make anything else, some idea
can be got of the probability now and then
entertained that many deaths, put down to
innocent causes, may really be the consequences
of poisons criminally administered.
Another attempt to legalise the totalisator in
Victoria has failed. Ikey Mo is safe for another
year at least, and some of his Parliamentary
allies have probably swilled champagne at his
expense. As usual, the totalisator’s opponents
were sublimely indifferent to harmony in their
vocal efforts, although they kept well together
when it came to a vote. Frank Madden, re-
presenting the gambling aristocracy of horse-
owners, objected to the machine, because it
would, so he said, prevent the public from los-
ing sufficient money to enable owners to win
enough, whereby these national benefactors
would be forced to sell their studs. Then the
breed of horses would deteriorate, and the
Indian trade would collapse; also “hunting, and
the other joys of the sport,” would perish along
with that essential personage, Ikey. “Let
truth and logic, wit and reason, go, but
leave us still our good old Ikey Mo,”
said Madden in effect. The present system
of betting, according to that enlightened
lawyer, is tantamount to an enormous public
subsidy of the horse-export trade, whilst the
bookmaker is properly privileged to sneak most
of the aforesaid subsidy for himself. After
Madden had railed against the suppression of
horseracing and gambling by a Tote Bill, a
number of other members objected to the awful
increase of gambling that must, so they said*
result from the same measure. They were
afraid to encourage the things that Madden
was fearful of discouraging, and so they
followed at his tail into the lobby. The bulk
of the Opposition, however, wisely refrained
from saying anything at all. They voted.
Isaacs was the only Hebrew champion of Ikey
who ventured to speak, and he perpetrated the
ancient gag that a respectable law ought not
to legalise gambling, although he is well aware
that the law of Victoria treats welshing as a
crime. Apart from Isaacs, there were two
Harrises, two Salmons, a Lazarus, a Zox,
and a Bosisto among the majority. Not one
Jewish-looking name figured among the list of
Tote supporters.

Parses urges that payment of members should
be placed on the same footing in Australia as
payment to Privy Councillors in England
(Hingland, Hingland, Hingland !) — i.e. , that
any member who fell into poverty might apply
for a grant from the Crown. That is as foolish
or as monstrous a proposal as Australia has
been treated to during the whole discussion of
the subject. A Cabinet Minister in England
receives a fixed salary while in office, and on
losing office lie is allowed, if he pleads poverty,
to draw .£2OOO per annum while he lives.
Beaconsfield, Childers, and others have
done so. But, passing over the indefensible-
ness of even that in a democratic country,
how can it be supposed the principle
would act if applied to members of
Parliament in Australia ? First, as the
English pensioner cannot hold office and draw
the £2OOO at the same time, the Australian
member, to complete the analogy, should resign
or be thrown out before the subsidy would
become available. If, however, it be supposed
that a subsidised member retains his seat, the
question arises on what testimony has his
subsidy been granted. Manifestly the claim
must be approved by the Ministry of the day,
and just as manifestly that member becomes,
or will be subject to the public obloquy of
having become, a tool of that Ministry. Second,
a proposal to pay a member because he is poor
and not because he does work introduces into a
new sphere the cast-iron political cheek which
fortifies politicians in being kind at the tax-
payers’ expense to their own ilk.
Thus Sydney Evening News : “If labour is so
grossly in the wrong, and capital so clearly in
the right .... how comes it, then, that
capital has so rooted an objection to arbitra ■
tion ?” A bold and undaunted championship of
Australian labour, this? A fearless and just
denunciation of Australian monopolists? Net
much. The E. News isn’t built that way.
There are two little words omitted from the
above quotation just where the dots mark a
hiatus. And those words are “in America.”
Which quite alters the whole complexion of the
bombastic bravery of the tirade. Like its com-
rade-tories, the News always pretends to take
the part of the workers when the attacked
monopolists belong to somewhere on the other
side of nowhere ; but, whenever there is indus-
trial trouble under its very nose, it hasn’t
language at its command vehement enough
to express its horror and indignation at
the insolence, the presumption, and the auda-
city of the workers, and its grovelling rever-
ence for the monopolist with “ a stake in the
country ” and an advt. in the News. Moral :
Never trust the paper that shrieks at the
iniquity of the Russian knout and applauds the
usefulness of the Australian lash.
Ur. Matthews, of Albury (N.S.W.), recently
acquitted on a grave but unwarrantable charge,
has received from the Colonial Secretary’s office
an official letter, expressing regret, virtually
apologising, and offering on behalf of the
Government “ to reimburse any reasonable ex-
penses incurred in connection with the defence.”
The Bulletin does not object to this handsome
apology and compensation being tendered Dr.
Matthews, but it is tempted to ask whether
the New South Wales Government has seen fit
to send a similar letter and a like offer to the
bushman arrested in Queensland by a super-
intelligent New South Wales constable, and
dragged over to Moree (N.S.W.) as the sup-
posed murderer in the discovery known as “ the
Barwon mystery ? ” That man, concerning
even whose name the wires have been dumb,
has been discharged as a victim of mistaken
identity, but there has been no report of any
offer on the part of the Government to compen-
sate him. Voluntary Government compensa-
tion is for the man in broadcloth, not for the
man in moleskins.
Melbourne Chamber of Commerce has been
treated to a lecture on the local law of in-
solvency by P. D. Phillips, and if the C. of 0.
still holds its peace concerning that legal out-
rage the uncommercial community will draw
some bold conclusions. Of one solemn clause in
the Vic. Act the lecturer said : “It was remiss-
ness on the part of the Government that such a
scandal was not rectified,” though he omitted
to add that the “ remissness ” has been staring
each successive Government in its brazen coun-
tenance for years past. As for private com-
positions Mr. Phillips repeated the oft-told
fact that “ Victoria held to a system which
most civilised countries had long given up —a
system which enabled a certain number of
creditors to accept any composition that
they pleased, and to make it binding
and effectual for those creditors who did
not agree to it, utterly regardless of the
debtor himself. The Vic. system had been
used in a manner that was never contem-
plated (?), and men who were actually criminals
were let through—with some scandal, un-
doubtedly—but the Court was powerless to
stop them.” Mr. Phillips concluded with an
anecdote of one compositioner whose solicitor
had actually prepared a Id. in the £ arrange-
ment, when the insolvent, observing that only
friendly creditors were present, suggested that
a half-penny would meet the case. The lawyer
thereupon reduced the gorgeous offer by one-
half, and it was carried unanimously. But
nobody seems to expect an effort at reform from
the Chamber of Commerce. That august body
knows its own business too well, probably.

The Victorian papers now declare in the plainest
language that the banks can’t go on paying 4jand 4J per
oent. on their reconstructed deposits, and that something
must be done to ease the strain. This probably means
more reconstruction. Interest has gone down consider-
ably since the famous arrangements were made, and the
bargain, which looked an exceedingly good one at the
time, now turns out to be very bad. If interest had gone
up, as was expected in some quarters, instead of going
down, the big pawnshops would doubtless have held on
to their bargain with the tenacity of the fierce, green
lobster; as it is, the case is different. In each instance
the banks retain power to pay off their liabilities at any
time, and those which are reasonably sound will probably
relieve the trouble by releasing the bulk of their deposits
and taking back those which offer at a lower rate, or else
they will secretly buy up a lot of their own depreciated
paper in the open market, as one institution has been
doing for some time back. But for those which dare not
release their deposits there seems no alternative, unless
things improve, save more reconstruction!

For the first time in many weeks ’there are
officially-reported buyers of Queensland National Bank
shares on the Sydney market. Price offering, Is. per
share (£4 paid up). The Q.N. is plainly, in the public
estimation, the most hopeless bank in ail Australasia.
The Queensland public, especially those in the know, will
anxiously watch political developments in relation to this
institution.

The Queensland National Bank (whose
shares are worth Is. on the Sydney market) now holds

* * * *
One of the complications which led the Bank of
New Zealand into its present queer position is that
curious piece of financing by which it professed, some
years ago, to sell a lot of its land to the B.N.Z. Estates
Go. When the Maoriland boom exploded the bank found
itself with between three and four million pounds worth
of land which was not immediately saleable. This awful
lock-up of its capital had to be alleviated somehow, so
the Estates Co. was formed, and the land was transferred
to it. The humour of the situation lay in the fact that the
B.N.Z. held practically all the shares in the Estates Co., so
it virtually sold its own unsaleable land to itself. The only
cash in the transaction was about £1,335,000, which the
Estates Co. raised in London by selling 5 per cent,
debentures at a serious discount, said debentures to be
redeemed on maturity at a premium. All this practically
amounted to the fact that the bank borrowed on its
landed property, alleged to be worth considerably over
£3,000,000, less than half its value, at the alarming figure
of over 6 per cent. The Hebraic rate of interest goes to
prove that the lenders felt anything but confident about
the security. The interest on this awful transaction has
been a mill-stone upon the institution ever since. No
bank can afford to borrow at 6 per cent, in times like
these, and as the debentures don’t mature until 1910, the
prospects of relief are still very remote.
When the B.N.Z. becomes a State bank, which
It probably will do in a very few years, the position of its
two smaller local rivals, the Colonial and the National,
will be tolerably precarious. They have held their own
with difficulty against the big bank in the past, but
when it becomes a State-guaranteed institution it will
mop up all the good business and leave them only the
dregs. If the Government wants to do the fair thing, it
should take over the whole three and amalgamate them
into one big national concern. In 1891, shareholders in
the National B.N.Z. were giving as much as 50s. a share
to anyone who would take the investment off their
hands, and holders who couldn’t do this tried to establish
an alibi, or else fled into places of concealment. The
scare proved unnecessary, and N.B. shares have since
recovered somewhat, but the institution is not in a posi-
tion to compete with a State bank, and is not likely to be
for many years to come.
The new shares of the B.N.Z. {£7 10s. paid up)
have buyers now at 35s. Ten years ago the £10 shares
sold within a fraction of £28.
* * * *
Until the £2, 000,000 worth of State-guaranteed
preference shares are paid off ten years hence, no dividend
is to be paid on the ordinary shares of the B.N.Z., except
by consent of the Treasurer. This may work well in
Maoriland, but in one part of the world, which Tub
Bulletin knows of, it would simply mean that the
Treasurer wouldn’t consent unless ho was allowed an
overdraft.

The official receiver in London of the Mercantile
Finance, Trustees and Agency Co. (Melbourne), demands
“a searching investigation ” into the conduct of the Aus-

somehow got through £600,000of paid-up capital, €320,000
of reserve fund, and something like a million of borrowed
money, and which seemingly doesn’t know to this day
how it was done. It is now being peacefully liquidated
by its own directors, who are thus invited to start a
searching inquiry into their own conduct forthwith.

There is serious talk in Victoria about the
advisability of the State taking over three or four recon-

Mat. Larkin’s brazen impudence hasn’t lost its
lustre in gaol, seemingly. His reappearance at South
Melbourne Police Court on three new charges was very
characteristic of dear old Mat. Dispensing with legal
assistance (though the Lord knows he could pay for
plenty of it), he got permission to sit at the barristers’
table, and there distinguished himself by insulting
accountant Simpson, who was testifying to the state of
the books. “ We don’t want your opinion, Mr. Simpson.
We know what it is worth,” snorted Matthias, and then
came the expected reference to Simpson’s little social
weakness. Financial criminals, convicted and otherwise,
are united in a great hatred for Simpson, the gifted un-
raveller of tangled figures and boss fraud exposer. He
has been clear-headed enough to discover swindles that
other people couldn’t detect as easily, and honest enough
to make them public in a way that was bound to excite
the wrath of Fat Man. It must have been Fat Man who
suggested Mat. Larkin's attack upon this valuable public
servant.
As far back as 1889, Mat. Larkin, in his private
capacity of estate agent, was sued for £3607 by a client
who couldn’t get a settlement of affairs from him. There-
upon Larkin, it is alleged, embezzled the money to meet
this claim from his unfortunate building society. There
doesn’t seem to have been the old excuse of “ mad land
boom speculation” in “honest Mat.’s” case. He wa’
probably (pending other people's cash long before lbs

The oableman sends out from Hingland the
truly important statement that some anonymous
person, calling himself “ A Depositor," has written to
the Times about Australian banks. This harmless ass
suggests that the reconstructed deposits should be con-
verted into stock repayable in 20 years and bearing in-
terest at 5 per cent. As the banks have already nearly
broken their backs in the effort to pay 4J per cent., the
suggestion is just about as sensible as a proposal that the
interest should be paid in worms for the convenience of
any depositor who wants to go out fishing. But it is
Hinglish, and any kind of British drivel is good enough
to oable out to the poor, miserable Australian.

In London, advertising a new 00. with a

ping, packing and postage of prospectuses costs £6
a thousand more. It is reckoned 50,000 prospectuses
should be sent out when raising £50,000 capital. There-
fore the prospectuses would cost £3OO. Add to this the
cost of advertising, and the promoter spends £l3OO for a
start. In Melb. you can float a Westralian Q.M. Co. of

The Trustees, Executors and Agency Co. of
Victoria, which has now been 16 years in existence, pre-
sents a cadaverous balance-sheet for the half-year ending
June 30. The profits for the 6 months amount to £2287
9s. Id., and a dividend at the rate of 7J per cent, per
annum absorbs £2250 of this, and leaves the co. just £37
9s. Id. to the good. This isn’t strengthening its position
to any marked extent. Out of the reserve-fund of £85,000
£65,000 is invested in freehold property, but as the receipts
for rent are only £632, and the expenditure for rent and
taxes is £795, the said investment seemingly yields a net
income of nothing at all, or thereabouts. Under these
circumstances, its value looks problematical. Even leav-
ing the £795 entirely out of the calculation, £632 isn’t
quite 2 per cent, per annum on £65,000, and a property
which only yields 2 per cent, on its nominal value seems
absurdly over-estimated for all practical purposes. There
is also a mortgage of *35,000 on the freehold, and the co.
has a similar sum invested to meet the liability when it
falls due, hut the interest earned on the £35,000 invested
is £320 short of the interest payable on the mortgage,
so the company’s property in reality only produces about
£3OO a year net—or less than 1 percent. All which seems
to suggest that it is a lamentably overrated investment,
and a millstoue round the co.’s neck. Apart from this
the institution has £79,000 invested (£lO,OOO in 4 per cent
Government stock, and the balance mostly on mortgage),
and the interest receipts average nearly 4J per cent.,
from which it would seem on the surface that the mort-
gages are mostly in a reasonably healthy state. The in-
come, however, shows a falling-off from last year,
and the co. spends £5830 in expenses for the purpose of
earning £5990 in commissions. Therefore, it only lives on
the interest on its own capital and reserve fund, and it
might as well shut up the trustee business altogether—
unless it is kept on for the sake of the management’s
health. This calculation doesn’t include interest on the
mortgage upon the office; when that is reckoned the
trustees business is a dead loss of about £l6O.

A Grenfell (N.S.W.) correspondent:—“There
are 19 proved gold-reefs on Grenfell, many of which are
being held on the “ nod.” A few are being squarely
worked. Capital would find good remuneration on any
of these reefs. The depths vary from 150 ft. to 400 ft.
The Homeward Bound, the prospecting claim of which
(six men’s ground) panned out £lO,OOO per man, is still
working. The reason most of the reefs have been lying
idle is that during the Gulgong rush Grenfell had very
wet weather, and as most of the miners had got through
the first gold-strata and could go no further on account of
the water, the majority cleared out for Gulgong. If a shaft
were sunk on any of the Grenfell reefs to the depth of
1000 ft., and driven for one or two hundred feet, it’s a
rail-road to a gooseberry that several reefs would be
out. 300 oz. of gold left Grenfell this last month of May,
the output of four reefs.—July 9.

At Wyalong, the new growl is that both War-

mining law has been broken by both Wardens, inasmuch
as instead of moving No. 1 up to the prospectors and so
on, spare ground has been left, and in more than one
instance the inter-miners have the best oi it. Survey fees
have been paid, and no surveys made.

The newagreement which has caused thestrikeak
the Sunlight (N.S.W.) mine seems to be a case of “ heads,
the owners win ; tails, the miners lose.” It is an attempt
to apply the sliding-scale to gold-raining. The men have
to keep up a minimum output of ore dressed in a par-
ticular fashion ; and their wage is to vary, not only with
the output, but also with the quantity of gold in the
stone ! That is to say, the miners take a large share of
risk without getting a corresponding share of profit. The
system is unfair, unless the miners become shareholders
in the 00. While they remain labourers only they should
be paid for the work they do irrespective of the value of
the stone. The price of gold is constant, unlike that of
coal. Supposing the average Sunlight yield were 20z.,
instead of 9dwts., would the directors ever dream of the
new agreement I

Yalgogrin (writes a Bulletin correspondent)
is 27 miles N.W. from Wyalong and 110 miles S.E. from
Hillston. Its population numbers about 400, and the
township was laid out by a progress committee, directed
by Warden Slee. It boasts 4 stores, 2 butchers, 2 bakers,
a workmen’s club, blacksmith’s shop, a sawmill, 2 J’s.P.,
and an Otis crushing plant, but has so far no police pro-
tection. The battery is now putting through 250 tons
stone from Thompson and party’s claim, which has a well
defined reef 3ft. to 4ft. 6in. wide (ironstone quartz),
carrying good gold. Alluvial is being found 7 miles from
here, on the Napier run. At present 12 payable claims
are raising stone, and some have 60 to 60 tons at grass,
awaiting their turn at the crusher. Warden Slee recom-
mends the resumption of Mrs. R. Payne’s conditional
purchase—a matter that should be attended to at once,
lor the area undoubtedly contains great mineral wealth,
and must lie untouched because the M. on P. Property
Bill practically prohibits mining on enclosed lands. The
resumption of the C.P. would open a field of labour for
hundreds of miners.

“Much bitter feeling is reported at Coolgardie
over the scores/ of those who found the Londonderry."
Silence often pays a good div.
• » ♦ «
Editor Bulletin, —When you come to Cool-
gardie don’t bring over a brace of horsepistols and a
cheap revolver. Arm yourself to the teeth with half-a-
dozen mouse-traps. Firearms are in small demand here,
but tucker and swags must be protected from the mice at
all hazards.
It is noticeable that the insane stampede of
hundreds of people coming over to Coolgardie without
any definite object in view, is quietly drawing to an end.
It seems to have struck them that gold cannot be picked
up in the streets, as they stroll about with their hands in
their pockets.
Things are now assuming a more healthy aspect.
Most of the reefs being opened up show well. The best of
them—mind you, I say “ the best”—even surpass the
average of good reefs, at similar depths, in places like
Charters Towers. This, I think, will prove to be the
“Towers"of W.A.
At a rough reckoning, I should estimate that
most of the alluvial now obtained here costs fully £2O an
ounce to win.
Trade is good, and the supply fully equal to the
demand. Horses, waggons, spring-carts, &0., are falling
in price ; also provisions and other necessaries, the hun-
dreds of teams now competing on the roads being the
cause. Business of most descriptions is no longer so
precarious and risky as in the past. For some time past
bricks have been made and brought into use upon the
field. And now the first house with a stone front is being
well and substantially erected in Bayley-street. The
three hanks here are busy night and day, and the Cool-
gardie Cyclist Express Co., floated almost solely here,
does good biz. A few months more will see Coolgardie no
longer a huge mining camp composed of bag-tents, tinned
meat and profanity, but a good solid place, with wide,
well-defined streets, good buildings (for W.A.), and the
natural business centre for all the outlying fields.
Fresh turnips, pumpkins, potatoes, onions,
oranges, &c., are now landed here and retailed in good
condition at a fairly reasonable rate. Business, generally,
is still hugely overdone ; the fittest only will survive; but
a great crowd are going to get a good living here. The
Qod-forsaken shanties and tents now passing muster for
post-offices, Warden’s Courts, hospitals, &c., are to be
shortly removed, and good buildings will soon take
the place thereof.—Yours, Harry W. Chbesbrodgh,
Bayley-st., Coolgardie, W.A.

Dear Bulletin, —You want the true “strength ”
of Coolgardie. Here you are : Coolgardie is at present a
“spieler’s," not a digger’s, field. There is lots of gold
there—brought there—mostly good Victorian, with heads
and tails. That Coolgardie will some day be a great reef-
ing field there is no possible doubt, but its future is
damned for years by the “ road-metal ” syndicates that
have been floated. There are numbers of claims there
that won’t go sdwts. to the 500 tons. If you have any
spare cash send it to me to get home with—you have far
more chance of getting it back. A pennyweight piece
found at Kurnalpi is a 10-ounce nugget at Coolgardie, and
a 1000-ounce nugget in the Argus, and 1000 more fools are
soon on their way to this “hell” with their earnings.
Coolgardie is bossed by rings and escaped Melbourne
land-boomers. The only people making money are store-
keepers, auctioneers, condenser-owners, grog-shoppers,
and camel-bosses. .Jumpers have done fairly well up to
date, and two ponies were offered to me to “ lep ” a
claim, but I was too much of a new-ohum then—l
wouldn’t refuse it now. There is absolutely no alluvial

In a year or two, perhaps less, the trouble at
Coolgardie will be water, not want of water. The latest
is that a great influx has been met with at 155 ft.
in the Carnage mins. It spurts through the borehole and
work has been suspended owing to the rapid rise of water
in the shaft. Every shaft at Coolgardie that has yet been
sunk 120 ft. has got water. The Government bore, which

there is a great improvement in the mine at iSOft., where

The bug-bear of N.S.W. timber-merchants just
now is the “ pocket timber-dealer.” This is a man whose
stock in trade consists exclusively of a pocket-book and
pencil, and he does his business right off his book, as it
were— i.e., he finds out that a building is to be started
somewhere; he goes to the architect, sees the plahs ahd
specifications, reckons how much timber will be needed,
and then gets the order, same to be delivered on the
ground, say, four months’ hence. When he has got
enough orders to make a cargo he (or a number of
him) cables to America and has his vessel out within
three months. Having to pay no rent, no interest, no
employes, he can do orders at 25 per cent, below the
ruling rate, and pay himself handsomely into the bargain.

Melbourne, J uly 17.
It is comforting to hear that at least one Mel-
bourne woman oan afford to buy a bit of good lace
and put some of her neighbours’ gown-trimmings
to the blush. A matron with an eye for the
elegant in Brussels point brought a gleam of glad-
ness into an old-established draper’s, the other
day, by actually purchasing—not merely looking
at—a piece of five yards at 20 guineas a yard.
I expect she was shown to her carriage with much
devotion after that. Such incidents set one think-
ing that drapery men ought to practise on bass
instruments and drums, for then a prize customer
could be played off the premises by a full band.
A semi-sacred air would meet the case nicely.
After all, our vice-regal Diana seems fated to
become the idol of the masses, even if she doesn t
supplant dear Lady Loch in the affections of the
“bong tong.” That narrative of her ladyships
catastrophe in the hunting-field, told by a privi-
leged eye-witness who carried a whisky-flask,
places the heroine in the centre of the stage with
limelight streaming down upon her blood-stained
beauty. Even the most matter-of-fact men, I
find, are evincing solicitude for the spirited lady’s
health. The subject of her nose quite agitates
them. Some of them would, I firmly believe,
mention the nose in their prayers, if they hadn’t
got out of the way of saying such things. For-
tunately, Dr. Fitz. promises that there shall be no
“permanent disfigurement,” which is satisfactory
in the future tense, but not suggestive of an early
reappearance in public. Saturday before the
accident Lady Hopetoun was looking her best at
Flemington races, in a well-off-the-ground blue
serge, and sable fixings. The short skirt gave the
“ Demmoline ” feet such a fine chance that the
Countess’s boots were as popular as Apsley’s
victory. She was, sportingly speaking, in rare
fettle that muddy day. The Manifold tip had
romped in, and the whole Guv’ment House crowd
had backed it.
The unco’ guid—why is it?—seem to be more
addicted to marrying and giving in marriage than
their livelier fellow-men. I hear that a pre-
eminently pious bank-director, at present on a
financial mission to London, has just announced
his engagement, or rather, re-engagement, on
blush-pink paper. This will be the good man’s
third matrimonial venture, and only the other
day he wept at his daughter’s wedding at Kew,
and painted, in harrowing terms, the desolation
of his widowed hearth.
There seems no lack of mean people, but the
champion unselfish man resides in the neighbour-
hood of Melbourne. He is a very well-known
suburban chemist, and was married recently.
Business is dull, and, after paying the clergyman
and other incidental expenses, funds for the
honeymoon were found to be strictly limited.
During the simple marriage-feast the bridegroom
carefully considered pros and cons. Realising
that a week’s change of air for two would cost pre-
cisely the same as a fortnight for one, he decided
that, from a hygienic point of view, the latter
would be more profitable. So he sent his wife to
a favourite resort, where she still is, no doubt
enjoying her honeymoon tremendously, while
Romeo stops at home to mind the shop and push
the pill trade.
At the Princess’ Theatre, “ Ma Mie Rosette ”
trips lightly towards the end of her sojourn, and
Browntow, quite at ease now, strains every nerve
to acquire his predecessor’s lady-killing knack.
Feminine critics in general aver that so far they
see no cause to blot out the memory of the “ dear
departed,” while the verdict of a fair society
oracle, re Brownlow, is “lovely on the stage, but,
in ordinary dress, only a large English lad ! ”
In some respects, of course, one can’t be too
“ Homey,” and of late every Melbourne marriage-
feast of any importance boasts a “real English
wedding-cake,” made to order in London. Its
sugared inscription, “ facsimile of Princess
May’s,” impresses the guests more than the
alleged cheques in sealed envelopes. It even
prevents the bride “ wishing she hadn’t,” when
hubby mangles his carefully-prepared speech, and
reveals himself in the unfamiliar (to her) aspect of
a drivelling idiot.
To return to “ Ma Mie Rosettethe gilt-edged
gardener’s daughter wears her hair in precisely
the same style throughout her varied experiences,
waking or dreaming. In real life, a brand-new
Marquise, dressed for a ball at a royal chateau,
would probably attempt an ambitious coiffure.
At all events, in the midnight scene, the
Stewart’s head-dress might be more in accordance
with the unwritten code of nocturnal fashion.
In Rosette’s time, a halo of meek braids would, I
believe, be no anachronism. The methods of ’94
are different, but few women, so far as I know,
court slumber in the chignons and Princess May
fringes of daylight.
Apropos, “curling-pins” are recommended as
an invaluable soporific. A friend (who, before
retiring to rest, occasionally flattens and combs
back her hair preparatory to reading a paper next
day on “the enfranchisement of woman,” or some
such topic) finds that sleep will not visit her eye-
lids until she gets up and pegs out her scalp in
orthodox fashion.
The Oamperdown estate, where Gov. Hopetoun
purposes spending the latter end of his Victorian
exile, and where the Countess will probably con-
valesce in this time of tribulation, is prettily
situated on the shores of a lake. The former
owner died some months back, and her daughter
married a few weeks later, so their home is now
available for vice-regal retirement. His Ex,
always has gushed over the beauties of Oamper-
down scenery, which pleased him all the better
from the luxurious conditions of life in those parts.
“Gov’ment House is shockin’ barracky, don’t
y’know !” The local squatters maintain the state
of feudal lords, and supply all their own domestic
needs, even to the making of gas.
It was at Oamperdown, as a press correspondent
remarks with a touch of reminiscent pathos, that
Gov. Hopetoun first practised polo; his tutors on
that occasion being the brothers Manifold, assisted
by scions of other illustrious houses.
Whose family-tree can hope to escape the
blighting influence of poor relations ? When
a party from Melb. Government House visited
Tasmania some years back they had a shocking
experience in point. Ever since then the merest
mention of the Tight Little Island disturbs vice-
regal equanimity, and in my Lady’s own apart-
ments it is the sure forerunner of burnt-feathers
and smelling-salts.
On that lamentable occasion hardly had the
vessel hove-to at Launceston than it was boarded
by an elderly matron and her pretty daughter,
the elderly intruder scurrying hither and thither
in search of “ My cousin, the Countess.”
Havingfound the Countess, this long-lost relative
proved her identity by handing in a faded paint-
ing labelled, “M Castle, the home of our
mutual great-grandmother.” The wily nobles
dissembled their agony and accepted the situation
by falling on their kinswoman’s neck and intro-
ducing her daughter to the suite, en masse. Before
parting they pledged themselves to afternoon tea
with their beaming Tasmanian cousin, who was
kind enough to promise that a photo, of “ M
Castle,” taken from the original masterpiece,
should commemorate the reunion. The day came,
the feast was spread, and the ladies, _ thoughtfully
arrayed in the family colours, waited for their
aristocratic connections until they realised that
the promises of “blood” are not a bit thicker
than water. Henceforth the demon of democracy
possessed this betrayed descendant of Celtic kings,
and she constantly dwelt upon the sins of her
great-grandmother’s line, beginning the catalogue
with “ Poverty ” and ending it with “ Pride.”
Governor Normanby (like Lord Jersey, who
once discovered a cousin of his in the proprietor of a
littleN.S. W. mountain saw-mill) was more tolerant
of obscure cousins. In Maoriland, when travelling
through a country district, he made a detour to
visit an unknown connection, who, having sunk
all his money in amateur fanning, was trying to
raise the wind by an experimental flour-mill.
The Marquis and suite found the miller as white
as Lot’s wife, owing to a hitch in the machinery,
which had necessitated burrowing through vats of
flour. He welcomed the nobility warmly, and
did his duty as a host, all day, in the same
farinaceous condition. Perhaps a bath, by trans-
forming this outer coating into a mass of dough,
would only have made matters worse.
Mrs. Paton, wife of New Hebrides Patom
whose letters were the best part of her husband’s
prosy “Life,” is writing a book on her own
account. She is a merry woman, in spite of her
husband, who weeps in and out of season. During
his recent visit to Canada the lachrymose mis-
sionary was called upon to identify a fraudulent
ex-parson, formerly of Melb., but just then await-
ing trial in the Dominion, for some characteristic
swindle.
As soon as Dr. Paton saw the culprit, he burst
into tears, as usual, exclaiming, “Lad ! lad ! but
I’m grieved to see you here!” “Not half so
much as I am to see you, Old Waterworks !” said
the black sheep. The inopportune arrival of an
Australian acquaintance had made his conviction
a certainty.
Herr Pinschoff, the originator of the “Credit
Foncier ” scheme (so far as Melb. is concerned) is
an authority on cuisine, as well as finance. In
his bachelor days he varied his billets-doux by en-
treating his talented fiancee to bring with her,
when she came to Australia to be married, every
cookery-book she could lay her hands on. She
obeyed with satisfactory results to all concerned.
When two eminent musicians (husband and wife)
visited us some time back, the enthusiastic Pin-
schoff testified his regard for genius by sending to
their hotel every day some chef d’oeuvre of national
cookery prepared at a Coll ins-street establishment
under his personal supervision.
According to a recent Bulletin paragraph,
“the daughters of a boss boomster, pupils at a
fashionable Melbourne college, are not likely to
encounter common people’s children, as, owing to
bad times, the latter are in most cases kept at
home to do the housework.” To make sure, how-
ever, “pa” enrolled the young ladies as “special
boarders,” engaging for their use a private sitting-
room, which even the teachers enter only by
invitation. Thus the wind is tempered to the
partially-shorn lambs.
One can now positively smell that Melbourne is
on the up-grade. “ Times-is-bad ” drove the one-
time smoker of fragrant Havanas to invest in vil-
lainous tobacco, the fumes from which rendered
suburban first-class railway carriages unbearable.
A man with a keen nasal organ tells me that he
can now detect the aroma of some of the finer
brands of tobacco, and that it is gradually growing
stronger.
A friend tells me that while visiting a small
Vic. township near Mount Macedon, the
other day, he attended a country funeral. The
horse was appropriately driven by a solemn man
with an inappropriately long red beard. The
vehicle stopped, and the coffin was conveyed
to the grave. “I looked for the clergyman, but
to my surprise the undertaker, who had retired to
the sexton’s house, then came forth attired in
clerical paraphernalia to read the prayers, after
which he disrobed and drove away. I now find he
is a licensed lay-reader, and acts as curate at
the parish church.” At this rate, we may yet
have a parson-undertaker acting also as doctor
and grave-digger.
The pilgrimage of the “Helping Hands” from
suburb to suburb is nearly accomplished—perhaps
none too soon. In the present cruel weather, the
springs of charity freeze hard, and the bonnie,
blithe, blink of oor ain fireside blinds one’s eyes to
the charms of peregrinating amateurs. Anyone
who patronises “ Helping Hands ” at a draughty
hall soon discovers that their mild sentimentali-
ties don’t tend to raise the circulation like
the methods of old professional hands. The
“spooney” passages in the gently dramati
sketch, “Dream Faces,” for instance, are marred
by the evident consciousness of the young pair,
that people are looking at them. The lady cast
for the innocent maiden titters constrainedly
where she should laugh naturally, while her lover,
who is shorter than his lass, never commits him-
self further than a waxed-moustache smile.
Mr. Innes-Noad is successful as a ne’er-do-well
father, but I think the sausage cut of his legs
would dissipate the last remnant of_ Aunt Mar-
garet’s love—if his butcher-boy winks hadn t
cured her sooner. A woman might condone the
riff-raffishness of her fallen hero, and shabby
gentility would probably awake her compassion ;
but “cheek,” under such circumstances, would
raise the dander of a saint.
Aunt Margaret, played by Mrs. Lewis, struck
one as too chastened for her age. Now that
grandmothers wear butterfly bonnets, a spinster
of 40 in perpetual mourning, with her hands
clasped, makes one impatient. The race of Aunt
Margarets is extinct.
At Max Hirsch’s lecture, the other night, the
chairman tried to prevent argument on the
grounds that the “ softer sex ” wished to catch the
10-o’clock train. Women like fair play, and apart
from that didn’t relish a fat man callingthem
“ the softer sex.” Mr. Zox, who gets no_ thinner,
was on the platform, and might just as fairly have
described us as the “plumper gender.”
At Melb. Women's Hospital, on Friday, the
ladies’ committee rebuked the matron for having a
picture representing kittens at play on one of the
walls. Evidently the committee aims at a mono-
poly of cattish things.
The N.S. Wales General Election.
At the time of writing, the election returns are
very incomplete, but the one fact which is abso-
lutely certain is that the present Protectionist
Government has been about as badly defeated as
any Government could well be. The old Free-
trade party—the men of the M'Millan revenue-
tariff persuasion—will evidently have a working
majority by themselves, and being able to dis-
pense with the support of the Labour element, all
necessity for preserving an outward semblance of
democratic sentiment has practically passed
away. The situation is, to all intents and
purposes, a return to the old days of the
Parkes regime, when land-tax and one-raan-one-
vote were not even dreamt of. Owing to the
woeful falling-off in the Protectionist party,
Labour will no longer hold the balance of power —
in fact, there is no balance to be held. The
National Ass wing of the Freetraders has secured
several seats, and this will probably stiffen the
backbone of the party of landlords and capi-
talists, and make it even less Democratic than
it was in the old days. A very large number of old
members vanish as the result of this election.
Suttor, Traill, Barton, Daniel O Connor and
Neild are among the lost; and of the Labour-
party, Cotton, Hindle, Kelly, and others
are missing. About the two biggest majorities
were those which swamped Traill and Cotton.
The aldermanic element will be very strong in
the new Parliament, which promises to be a
Legislature consisting principally of Parkes and
a vast collection of dull, conservative mediocrities.
The River Murray in its course falls 1

The memorial services to the murdered
French President at St. Mary’s R.C. Cathedral,
Sydney, were originally fixed for the same date as
that on which the Barraba murderers are to be
executed.
N.S. W. Beekeepers’ Association, in object-
ing to State school-teachers keeping bees, is on
the same industrial plane as the mat-makers who
object to prisoners making mats. There is in
both cases a surplus over personal use and that
surplus goes into competition with outside in-
dustry. The policeman’s wife who, out of his
wages, keeps three hens and manages to sell a
dozen eggs a week, is on directly the same footing
and should, as happened years ago in Victoria, be
suppressed if prisoners’ industry be suppressed.
Premier Patterson still maintains at the
perennial banquet, where he rises in evening dress
to pour out his full soul from above the turtle fat,
that there is very little poverty in Victoria, and
that the province is quite able to cope with any
that does exist. Yet every morning he can see
from his official window the police “dispersing”
the frost-bitten dead-beats from off the damp
grass in the Treasury Gardens, where they have
spent the night, and starting them off down the
street lest their presence should be a beastly
advertisement for the country. But perhaps
Patterson never looks out of the window.
The New Order, a Sydney Labour organ,
strikes an important truth :
Attorney-General Heydon holds that missing word com-
petitions are illegal, and has notified promoters to dis-
continue them. Whenever Labour men or Radicals
technically “infringe the law’’ they are never notified by
a kindly disposed Attorney-General— but when it’s the
proprietors of the sixpenny Bulletin and twopenny
Tkijtii there you are, don’t yer know 1
Truly, there you are. When The Bulletin broke
the law by running a missing word competition it
received a polite intimation from the Attorney-
General’s department that it must leave oft doing
it. When Mr. Andrews broke the law by
circulating a harmless pamphlet with a technically
deficient imprint, he didn’t receive any polite in-
timation from the Attorney-General; he simply
received three months. Moreover, Mr. Andrews
obviously offended from pure ignorance, whereas
The Bulletin didn’t offend from ignorance, and
didn’t even pretend to. Therefore, as the New
Order eloquently remarks, “ there you are.”
The Victorian Boom-Its Price in Crime.
In one of bis books Marion Oraweord tells
how, at a certain period of the year, the reindeer,
calmly grazing in their northern pastures, begin
to exhibit symptoms of unrest, which speedily
expand to an uncontrollable'excitement, and,
turning their faces towards the ocean, the herd
with one accord commence their journey at a
gallop over the hundreds of miles that may in-
tervene, and continue without pause until they
reach the confines of the ocean. Then, having
tasted of the salt sea, they return peacefully to
their wonted pastures. Any one who has to do
with large bodies of men finds fitful examples of
like unreason. Soldiers become restless and
insubordinate, workmen discontented, scholars
unmanageable. Of this spirit the prisons afford
the most striking examples. With scarce any
warning murmurs of discontent, prisoners break
out in open mutiny, destroy their clothing and
other belongings, assault their keepers, and
give general evidence of temporary madness,
which subsides more rapidly even than it arose.
* * •
Nor is the general population exempt from
similar disturbances, which appear so un-
accountable on any ordinary principles that
writers of good repute have endeavoured to ex-
plain the phenomenon by supposing some
external physical forces operate on human
affairs. Lyon Playfair formulates a theory of
economic cycles to account for periods of in-
dustrial activity and depression. These cycles
are not the direct product of human agency, and
are not far removed in character from the re-
current periods of disturbance observable in
social life. N.S.W. astronomer Russell
postulates, with some show of reason, a nineteen
years’ periodicity of rain, depending on the size
of the sun-spots; and Statistician Johnston, of
Tasmania, has a theory of light and heavy
mortality dependent on the movement of
Jupiter’s satellites and other planetary eccen-
tricities. To whatever cause they may be due,
there are social as well as industrial ferments
which seem to occur at regular periods. Now,
the impulse puts on the aspect of religion and
is called a revival, now of commercial madness
and is called a boom, and as often as not coinci-
dent with the other two, the social distension is
marked by an eruption of crime as hideous as
unaccountable. Of the three, the last is the
most interesting.
* • *
The late boom, here in Victoria, to which we
attribute all our woes, was fairly under way in
1887, and may be considered as having spent
its force within five years. To illustrate the
business in hand, it will not be unprofitable to
compare the five years which closed with 188 G
with the five years from 1887 to 1891, during
which the boom raged strongly. No one can very
well trace any necessary connection between the
boom and murder and other blood crimes.
That murders should be common in times
closely following a boom is a thing easy to be
understood. But what are the facts ? In the
year before the boom the arrests for murder
and other crimes involving the shedding of
blood had a yearly average of just over 100 ; in
the boom period they numbered on the average
134 —in one year, indeed, the arrests were 151 ;
since the smash, strange to say, the average
has dropped to less than 100. Assaults on
females increased greatly during the boom, but
have since fallen below their former average.
Forgery rose from 70 a year to 110. Drunken-
ness and disorder showed a yearly score of
20,200 arrests before the boom, compared with
26,700 during its continuance. Assaults on the
police averaged 820, compared witli 950—the
present rate is below 700. Violent attacks on
property rose from 250 to 420, other offences
against property from 3200 to 4000, and violent
assaults from 1100 to 1280.
# # #
What is also very curious about this saturnalia
of crime is the pause for breath in 1889, about
the middle of the boom. Crime did not fall
altogether to its normal level, but offences of
all kinds were much less frequent than in the
two preceding and the two subsequent years.
It would be an excellent thing if it w’ere pos-
sible to place all this bloodshed, riot, debauchery,
lust and general roguery to the discredit of
Jupiter’s satellites, but if we do so we must
place amongst the satellites the Melbourne
papers one and all, the Matthew Davieses, the
banks, the Larkinses, and the Government
itself, all having striven with equal earnestness
to augment the social madness. No one has yet
made out a balance-sheet of the boom. When
it is prepared—if it is accurate—it will have to
the debit; 170 murders, 1500 violent assaults,
100 serious crimes against women, 850 bur-
glaries, and 4000 other raids on property, 200
cases of forgery, 32,500 of riotous drunkenness,
all within five years—offences which would
never have been committed had there been no
boom.

It was last week wired to the daily press
that “a band of shearers ” was to be despatched
to dynamite the walls of Tam worth gaol in order
to release the convicts Lee and Cummins. The
calm assumption that the “ shearers ” sympathise
to such an extent with two murderers-for-the-
sake-of-gain is most instructive.
Dear Bulletin, — To know that a rifle-
bullet will lay the recipient out without touching
his skin, doesn’t require an expert—unless Pm an
expert by virtue of having once intercepted a
“spent ” bullet with my manly breast. It didn’t
get through my clothes, but it knocked me heels
over-head like a brickbat. And that bullet had

People will be sorry to hear that a very
prominent N.S.W. politician’s illness is believed
to be heart-disease.
Seven reporters have gone from the Age
staff during the past few months. David Syme
has Speight preying on his liver.
The well-beloved Landseer, M.P., says
the farmers of S.A. “have been scratching their
heads for years to find a solution of the vermin
difficulty.”
Of the eight lady doctors in Melbourne,
three are named Stone. Dr. Constance Stone was
the first “native” lady doctor to practise in the

In last N.S.W. Parliament, of 141 mem-

Parkes’ father, at 70, was an absolutely

Bishop Kennion’s appointment to the see
of Bath and Wells makes the third of such trans-
fers from Australasia to England. Bishop Moor-
house to Manchester and Bishop Selwyn to Lich-
field were similar promotions.
That ex-Ageut-General Bray’s mental con-
dition was much exaggerated is proved by the
fact that less than a week before he died he wrote,
signed, addressed and posted at Aden a perfectly
coherent letter to editor Bonython, of Adelaide.
His object was to catch the Messageries boat,
which was expected to beat the Oceana by a day
in the run to Adelaide.
The mispronuncia-
tion of the word, “Moran”
causes much indignation
amongst Hibernians. A
story in point: Bishop
Moran, of Maori land,
had a parrot which used
to overhear the enquiries
of callers, many of whom
(non-Catholics) gave a
wrong construction of
the Bishop’s name. One
day the parrot was heard
assiduously repeating—
“ Bishop M’ran, Bishop
M’ran, Bishop M’ran—
no, Bishop Mawran,
Bishop Mawran, Bishop
Mawran. Quite correct,
quite correct.”
A review editor,
writing from London to
an Australian pressman,
remarked lately that the
Sladenesque analogies
which Australian writers
institute ■ between their
countrymen and eminent
men of elsewhere, have
a tendency to prejudice
people against Austra-
lians altogether. As if to
illustrate, he stated that
he once received an
article from Australia,
which afterwards reached
print in a London penny
paper, wherein the writer
referred to a Mr. John
Osborne as the Danton of
Australian letters, to a
Mr. Curnow as the
Thucydides, to a Mr.
Drayton as the Rabelais,
and to a Mr. Hogue as the
Mirabeau of antipodean
literature. The review
man added: “Have you
no animals or ancestors
of your own to liken your
great men to ?”
Parkes sent the letters he received from
Tennyson, in re ’Enry’s volumes of verse, ’Ome to
the dead laureate’s eldest son. Parkes possibly
expects a Tennysonian volume of reminiscences
with those letters in a conspicuous position.
The Bulletin hears that a very hairy
politician, who calls himself a “ statesman,” now
writes two leaders a week for the S.M. Herald.
It is understood that a certain prominent Judge
also contributes to the Herald’s leading columns.
The old offices of “ Bob ” Nichols, in Pitt-
street, Sydney, where “Jimmy ” Martin (N.S.W.
Chief Justice) early in life dusted musty law-
books, cut his initials into the legal furniture,
and subsequently served his articles, were vacated
recently, and the time-honoured relics removed
to a brand-new building.
Bad luck pursues Billy Pattison, of Rock-
hampton (Q.), ex-Oolonial Treasurer and quondam
Mt. Morgan millionaire. His uninsured boiling-
down works were destroyed by fire on the 14tn
inst., and he loses thereby several thousands
sterling.
John Dornan, an old N.S.W.-Vic. border
settler, and one of the first aldermen of Albury
(N.S.W.), died on I3th inst., aged 86 years; and
Michael O’Shea, for half-a-eentury a settler in the
Wellington district, N.S.W., died on 14th inst.,
aged 96 years.
Had Cummins, to be hanged at Tamworth
on 20th inst., not been convicted of the Barraba
murder, he would have probably been among the
candidates at the N.S.W. general elections. As it
is, he stands on the hangman’s hustings, asking for
the suffrages of God.
Kemp, the Vic. civil servant who got five
years for embezzlement, was confident that he
would receive a light sentence, and at a football-
match, on the Saturday before his trial, he said
he expected about 12 months. Then the faithful
crowd drank to his speedy liberation.
Cardinal Moran (N.S.W.) says that none
of the party leaders have been able to discover
whether he is a freetrader or a protectionist. The
Bulletin categorises him as—“nayther, and
ayther, and both.” Nayther, politically ; ayther,
educationally; and both, in blended sense.
J. M. Barrie, the novelist, is reported to
be dangerously ill in London, and the doctors are
said to have little hope of his recovery. Yet that
other novelist, Isaiah Reginald Cohen, of Sydney,
continues in robust health. Truly poetic justice
is only a dream and the shadow of a shade.
Apropos medical officers in lunatic asylums
becoming mentally shaky. The resident med.
in the chief asylum of a southern province was
lately examined by leading doctors, who have
confidentially informed Govt, that he is insane.
The officer is now on leave prior to retirement.
The just-demised N.S.W. squatter Rand
was one of bushranger Morgan’s victims. Morgan
made him put up a notice on bis gate: “All
travellers welcome.” After Morgan was shot,
down came the notice. The travellers came. Says
Rand ; “ Eh, but yer freend’s gone the noo.” Yet
Rand was not a mean man.
Kaahu, a Maori chief said to have been
120 years old, died at Turakina (M.L.) on June
18. Nearly a century ago, when the Waikato
tribes warred against Kaahu’s tribe, he, with
others, was captured. He was a slave with the
Waikatos for over 50 years, but 40 years ago he
was permitted to make his way back to his friends.
Which of the Australised sons of Charles
Dickens is the young man for whom the novelist
obtained a business-appointment in China? The
story goes that the son in question was bon-
voyaged by his parent and a distinguished com-
pany at a fine family dinner, and the guest of the
evening carried out the tradition of such occasions
by becoming elevated and noisy. Then father
Charles, in his best manner, suggested that, as
the boy was anxious to gain Chinese experience,
“ a little transaction in tea ” would be desirable.

J. L. PURVES. Q.C.
Mrs. Keirnan, of Albury (N.S.W.), who
died on Friday, 13th inst., aged 96 years, was
supposed to be the oldest native of the province,
having been born at Prospect, near Parramatta,
in 1798. She married the late Dr. Keirnan,
the medical superintendent of the first Australian
immigrant ship, and leaves innumerable descen-
dants.
A. Alston, who won the Yic. National
Gallery Travelling Scholarship of 1890 with his
picture, “Flood Sufferings,” is now doing some
clever black-and-white brush drawings in the
London weeklies. Rupert Bunny (it is not he,
by the way, but his brother George who is the
barrister of the family) seems to be the only other
Australian artist who oan tear himself away from
colour; his work in the French magazines is
simple, pretty and effective.
Our recent visitor, the Duchess of Buck-
ingham, in her “Glimpses of Four Continents,”
speaks of “the portrait of the Earl of Hopetoun
in his hat” as very effective. The Duchess, who
is to be married shortly to a sexagenarian peer, is
chiefly remarkable as the wearer of the biggest
spectacles ever seen off the nose of a Chinese shop-
keeper.
LADY HOPETOUN.
Mr. J. R. Fairfax, chief proprietor of
S.M. Herald, has reprinted for private circula-
tion one of the addresses of his father, the late
John Fairfax. The address was originally
delivered nearly 40 years ago, and contains among
a number of profound sentiments the following
insufficiently-realised truth : “It is a solemn thing
to be a man.”
The Argus has heard from poor old John
Nimmo, ex-M.L.A. for South Melbourne, snuffle-
buster, teetotal crank, Premier Permanent boom-
ster, and once Minister of the Crown. John prays
that “all the good, honest people of Victoria may
be protected from land-sharks, scare-mongers and
wreckers.” Nimmo is living in some out-of-the-
way Scotch hamlet, whence he departed when the
Premier Permanent burst, and his associate,
Mirams, was gaoled. The announcement that he
does not intend returning to Australia proves the
genuineness of his prayer.
Andrew MTlwraith, of jMTlwraith,
M’Eacharn & Co., was lately in Rockhampton.
MTlwraith was really the father of the frozen
meat industry, inasmuch as he despatched the
first cargo of frozen meat to London, per s.s.
Strathmore, in 1880. Singularly enough MTl-
wraith resides at St. Albans, the birthplace and
residence of Francis Bacon, who fell a victim to
his desire to achieve what MTlwraith has suc-
cessfully accomplished. It will be remembered
that the former died from a heavy cold contracted
during chilling experiments.
A connecting-link between past and pre-
sent Sydney passed away on Sunday in the person
of Mrs Isabella Long, relic of that wealthy old-
time identity, “ Bill ” Long. Mrs. Long was the
mother of three daughters, two of whom wedded
men who have made a mark in the history of N.S.
Wales. The eldest in ’53 married the doughty
James Martin, solicitor, afterwards Attorney-
General and Premier, and finally Chief Justice.
Another married the “shirt-sleeved Caesar,”
W. B. Dailey, who became Attorney-General,
and (by reason of his Soudan expedition) a Privy
Councillor, and who could have been Chief Justice
had he chosen. The third married George Cheeke,
nephew and Associate to Mr. Justice Cheeke, of
racing fame. The only son of the lady just
deceased is Mr, W. A. Long, M.L.0., sometime
N.S.W. Colonial Treasurer. Thus “Old Bill”
loved law and politics, having wedded hisdaughters
to the profession and put his son also to the Bar.
The latter, however, has never practised, being
content with the great wealth inherited from his
father.
The chairman at a West Macquarie (N.S.
Wales) election meeting, the other day, intro-
duced W. H. Marriott, a candidate, in these
terms: —“Blokes, we’re yero ter-night ter yere
Marriott. Ye all know him. He’s a farmer
somewheres—a tiller er the soil. On lookin’
around at this yere push assembled, I carn't find
a face as intelligent as his’n.”
The Hon. Berkeley, the present Chief
Justice of Fiji, is very strict and differs vastly
from former ones. The most popular Chief Judge
Fiji ever had was the most eccentric. A stranger
at the Courthouse dared not laugh or express sur-
prise if he should observe his Honor, when deciding
some knotty Coolie case, calmly remove his wig
and place it carefully on his water-bottle. His
first session, it is said, he appeared one morning
with a beard on one side of his face for the clerk
to decide which style he should adopt in order to
meet the exigencies of the climate.
W. J. Tarplee, the veteran Sydney press-
man, ex-chief reporter of the S.M. Herald, who
died last week, appointed himself the providence
at different periods, of three or four of the most
unmanageable pressmen of Sydney. He lectured
them when they did badly, extolled them when
they did well, and was often poorer in pocket on
their account. He drifted into Government em-
ployment in the hope of one day receiving the
appointment of editor of that incongruous pro-
duction, History prom the Records. Tarplee
was the sort of man who goes to Heaven when he
dies, for he had not an enemy in the world, not
even himself.
I DON’T LIKE TO TALK OF MYSELF.
“I’ve little to say of myself.” (Parkes* opening sen I enee
as reported in Review of Reviews.) The pronoun “I”
then occurs just 20 times in 20 lines.
I was born in a cottage at ’Ome,
I deserted that cottage to roam ;
I was young (in my childhood) and gay,
I was fond of the gals in my day ;
I was handsome and tall as a Samson or Saul,
And I’ve little to say of myself.
I am eighty, ye scoffers, to-day.
And a hearty old buck in my way;
I’m a Premier, a knight, and a poet,
And what I don’t pay—why, I owe it;
I’m devoid of all guile, as you see by my smile,
And I’ve little to say of myself.
I once was a Radical red.
But now I’m a Radical dead ;
I am fond of the lay and the lyric,
Of the Empire and all things Empiric ;
I am modest and shy, as you see by my eye,
And I’ve little to say of myself.
From the plains of the West to the sea
You’ll hear ’em a-talking of Me—
Of Me and My eloquence mellow,
My poems on Me and My Stella ;
I could tell you much more, but I mentioned
before
I don’t like to talk of myself.
Q-
P. L.
Purves.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
No Australian barrister keeps quite so much in
evidence as James Liddell Purves, Q.C. He is
always the foremost man in Melbourne’s foremost
case. His ability is most versatile—no man living
is more prompt in receiving impressions and
gleaning the knowledge immediately useful to the
advocate.
Mr.Purves, born in Victoria, began hiseducation
at Melb. Diocesan Grammar School, a little brick
place, near St. Peter’s Church, under the ferule of
Mr. Budd, afterwards chief of an important
ladies’ seminary. His schoolmates there included
Box, the barrister, and Harry Budd, the cricket-
ing and theatrical attorney, while Vicar Hand-
held, now of St. Peter’s, was a kind of junior
master. Purves’ father was a wealthy but
eminently luckless racing man, and but for this
hereditary kink Purves would never have eared
two straws for the turf—so he is as unlucky as his
father was.
Like Dick Ireland and Aspinall, he is no lawyer
■ —from an expert’s view-point. Campbell said of
Brougham, “He would know everything, if he
only knew a little law,’’ and yet lie made an
excellent Chancellor, even as Purves would make
a better Judge than Tubby Kerferd, or possibly
as good a one as Hartley Williams. However, he
is not likely to be one—the job would bore him.
Where Purves excels all is in grasping and
analysing technicalities —whether in surgery,
medicine, soft-goods, sea-craft, mining, engineer-
ing, or whatever may turn up, and proving that
the 30,000 volumes of law-books in the Supreme
Court Library are as entirely off the matter, of
any practical consideration, as was Dogberry’s
statement of the case to Leonato.
Purves is never ill, and never well. Men built
thus must be excused for being irritable and
tetchy, and their hearts may be wrongly blamed
for their stomachs, livers, or kidneys. Shelley
said the “ Cenci” would never have been such a
fine play but for the horrible pain he endured
while writing it. Give Purves a good pain—his
favourite one is a cobbler stitching at his side—
and you will have a good, bludgeony speech. His
malaise may be read in his smileless and soulless
visage, but no man is more beloved by his friends,
for he is staunch and true, shaping up for some
such a character as the Tory Lord Eldon, of whom
the mob shouted “Cheer him; he never ratted.”
When the new Courts were opened, luxurious,
wadded chairs were provided. Purves insisted on
having a cane one for himself.
Like Syme, S. Y. Winter, and other ferocities,
Purves is kind-hearted. A genuine appeal to his
mercy will spoil his cross-examination—and so
will a bold defiance. Otherwise he undoubtedly
sails very close to the bullying line, in
a thorough identification of himself with
the convictions and feelings of his client.
This is not with malice prepense—it is uncon-
scious, and he is inclined to weep if any
club crony tells him he has been cruel. Good
actors nowadays are termed convincing, and here
is forensic Purves—he puts on his cause like a
well-fitting surtout. He “goes blind.” It is an
elephant crashing through the jungle, a Jugger-
naut oar driven on, with its thick wooden wheels,
over any number of carcasses.
He is intense in his fondness of home. His only
drawback there is that he never can shake off his
cases ; go where he will, he always has one,
only one, on his mind, brooding over him, rather
than he over it. Joe Thompson, on the night
before the battle of the Melbourne Cup, was not
more wakeful than Purves is on the eve of launch-
ing a great case, or summing it up—as he is accus-
tomed to tell his juries. It is an octopus,
clasping him round. No one will say his powers
are truly great. Other men, his rivals, could have
done as much, if they were only enabled to have
such a feeling of their business, able to imbue
themselves with their case, live for a day, or a
week, or a month, the very life of their client, as
with an Avatar.
His club is the Athenaeum. Matt. O’Shanassy
is the man he most misses, and he gets on admi-
rably with Harrie Smith, and all those of turfy
flavour, although he really does not care much for
the turf. Popping at pigeons is his offhand little
hobby. He will dabble in billiards and any card
game you like, but never can detach his mind for
any hearty pleasure—always triste, morne, sar-
donic : a mixture of the most awkward points of
the English and German. He has been twice
married, and has a family.

POLITICA
POINTS
Let the Victorian civil servants beware
that they do not lose their votes.
“Queensland capitalists have all the vir-
tues of capitalists generally, except the possession
of capital.” — J. G. Drake.
Ballina, N.S.W., electorate, with some-
where about 2500 names on the roll, has only four
persons described as “ gentlemen.”
Current American events bring to memory
the devices for selling the Australian State rail-
ways. If we sell the railways, we buy a civil war.
When Sydney Daily Worker quotes the
phrases of “a great Australian, the late Chief
Justice Martin,” it should remember that that
great Australian was a cast-iron Protectionist.
Balaam Epps, secretary of N.S. Wales
National Ass., dates his official bulls from
“Aurum Chambers.” “Aurum”— “gold.” Gold
—the colour of carrots. Carrots —the lure of the
Asa.
“ If there is one thing I have to be thank-
ful for more than another, it is that daring my
public life I have saved myself from the disgrace
of ever having been a colleague of Henry Parkes.
—G. H. Reid.
Woolloomooloo (Sydney) hustings orator :
“Lemme tell you, gentlemen, that ther tie which
binds us to ther Mother Country ain’t never so
strong as—er, as—er, as when it ain’t pulled too
tight, gentlemen.”
Maoriland Upper House, which still con-
tains many rich, full-bodied nominees, has
violently shocked the Cold Tea-party by vetoing
the Lower House’s resolution to close the bar of
the Parliamentary refreshment-room.
Sydney publicans, particularly those carry-
ing on business near Parliament House, are,
according to a prominent N.S.W. local optionist,
the most energetic workers in the movement to
abolish the local Parliamentary liquor bar.
The Royal Tar, after carrying a cargo of
coal from Newcastle to Honolulu, will go to Puget
Sound for a load of timber for Melbourne. Ihe
New Australians wishful to return to the old
home will apparently have to wait a long time for
their ark.
Dr. J. W. Barrett, lecturing at Melbourne
on “Government by Popular Clamour,” argued
that the history of civilisation shows that the
dissolution of States has always “commenced
from the time of the full extension of the franchise
to the people.” Now, no State has ever tried
“ the full extension of the franchise to the
people.”
Teetotal fanatics have
quietly cooked their own
goose by their meddling with
matters educational in
Queensland. Owing to tee;
total pressure a weak-kneed
Minister for Education in-
troduced Richardson’s trea-
tise on total abstinence into
the State schools. But three-
fourths of the Northern
teachers drink whisky and
consequently are out of sym-
Sathy with the innovation.
Result —Richardson’s tenets
occasionally taught seriously,
but generally quietly ridi-
culed to the young sprigs in
the Northern province.
Herein lies a valuable lesson
for the Bible-in-State-sohools
agitators.
One of the constantly-
repeated gags among the
daily rot of electioneering
candidates is that “the in-
troduction of female suffrage
will raise the moral tone of
politics.” The men who
mouth this are either the
most arrant among humbugs,
or else they are political
Rosicrucians, who waste for-
tunes of energy over an
imaginary “philosopher’s
stohe.” The naked, brutal
truth is—“ There is no
‘moral tone’in politics ” to
be either lowered or raised.
And, as long as an upper
rung in political circles
means power and easy, if
sinister, means to acquire
pelf, a “ moral tone ” will
never be born into the poli-
tical drum.
“Royalty,” says the
Age, “ is a state of splendid
pauperism, in which the
princes and princesses a.#
quartered as pensioners on
the taxpayers of the nation.”
Pangloss admits that much, but maintains that
the Benevolent Asylum system of government is
the best of all systems in the best of all nations.
At a N.S. W. election meeting. Question :
“ What do you consider the three great factors in
the production of wealth?” Candidate ; “Such a
question his a very good one for a debating
society, but hit his hentirely hout of place at a
political meeting.”
Premier Patterson, in talking high about
the country “ keeping faith with the pensioners,”
now and hereafter, was simply making a virtue of
necessity. The country wouldn’t be so magnani-
mous if it could possibly help it, which was clearly
indicated by the utterances of Ministers on the
subject before the Law Department’s opinion
came to hand. Then the ugly tune was suddenly
changed.
“ The policy of the Parkes Government,”

appeal to the London market for loans until all

Apparently all other resources got exhausted very
quickly under a Freetrade policy.

J, A. Cruickshank, M.P. for Inverell
(N.S.W.), the only candidate returned unopposed
at the general election, owns more than half of the
area of his constituency. Alderman Matthew
Harris (Sydney), who was not elected unopposed
for Denison division, belongs to a family that owns
most of that electorate. Isn’t any such factor
almost an act of bribery or coercion under the new
law ?
There were 529 candidates for the 125
(single) seats of N.S.W. Assembly. Inverell
was the only uncontested ln 29
electorates, there were 5 candidates apiece; 26
districts had 4 candidates ; another 26,_ three ; 21,
two ; 10, six ;5, seven ; 3, ten (!); 2, nine ; and 2,
eight candidates. The average number of candi-
dates for each of the 124 contested electorates is a
small fraction over 4|!
Says a Sydney paper, the New Order
(organ of the L.E.L. Central Committee clique :
It’s now ability and honesty that’s demanded for Par-
liament —and that bill is filled by W. A. Holman.
Which is very charming, considering that the
modest Mr. Holman aforesaid, who put up against
the tried and square Labour-member, G. D. Clark,
is generally credited with having a finger in the
New Order pie. “ Our brother Bill! ”
South Australia is about to cut deeply into
its civil service salaries; all public officers, except
the Judges, are to lose 25 per cent, of the sum
they receive in excess of £6OO yearly. The first
£l5O is exempt, the next .£l5O pays 6 percent.,
the next £3OO pays 12h per cent., and above that
sum as before stated. Thus the Agent-General
comes down from £l5OO a year to £1230, and the
Chairman of Railway Commissioners from £2500
to £1990.
F. M. Stone, a Westralian Legislative
Council candidate: —
1 am opposed to one man one vote.
1 am opposed to payment of members.
I am opposed to a land-tax.
I believe in the stock-tax (which raises the price of meat
for the benefit of the squatter).
I would support a bonus for the best clip of wool.
I am in favour of coloured labour.
As a specimen of the insolence of a landed aristo-
cracy this is hard to beat.

Griffiths’ (Q.) sentence of nine months’
hard, awarded to the “seditious ” Mount Morgan
crank, lately cropped up in Maoriland Parliament.
One loyal Labour member thought the sentence
well-deserved, and hoped everybody who took the
Queen’s name in vain would get as much. Then
said Radical O'Regan: “And yet, on the gold-
fields, I have heard men go even farther, and take
the Almighty’s name in vain ; but I cannot remem-

thus insulting the highest of potentates.” Queens

A while ago Jenkin Coles, the newly-
knighted S.A. Speaker, waxed wrath at the
immorality of land-value taxation. Then a cor-

Victoria will soon begin to shake oil the
imported military and naval persons who say
“ Haw ! ” and dem the colonials. As a preliminary
measure, Patterson has arranged to reduce the pay
of these British heroes, which is J.B.P.’s most
wholesome idea of Government thus far. Jingo

old London ” in November next, will be succeeded
by another majah-general at £5OO per annum less,
A new naval commandant due about the same
time is to get £lOOO instead of £1250 allowed to
present Captain White. The seconds in command
of either service will be genuine Victorian articles

M Millan would refuse to join any N.S._W.
Ministry that proposed to include Wise. Nor
would M'Millan join Parkes, whom the most
men of the N.S.W._ I reetrade-party
now despise on account of his twistings and
obvious desire for office at any price. The hope-
less breach between Parkes and M Millan dates
from the time when the treacherous old man
“ turned dog ”on W. M‘M. over the police-control
business during the maritime strike. In some
circles it is thought that M Millan seeks to sup-
plant his present friend, Reid, as Freetrade leader,
but the suspicion will probably prove to be an
unworthy one, as, to quote the words of a Free-
trade boss,_ M Millan is a perfect little horse.
One thing is certain : Parkes must be Premier or
nothing, and a large number of powerful Tree-
traders are determined that, if they can manage
it, he shall be nothing, however things go.
An official report on insanity in Ireland
declares that much of the neurotic disease and
madness prevalent in that country is due to the
continued inordinate use of tea and tobacco.
This is quite believable. Every reader of this
par. must know several teetotallers who are subject
to recurrent fits of D. Tea., and are ordinarily
“as mad as hatters,” Will some penological
statistician please tell for what percentage of
criminality in Australia tea-drinking is respon-
sible ? The subject is a fearsomepne, and suggests
the necessity of legislation against tea-swilling.
Afternoon tea awakens the malice of the gentlest
women, and makes assassins of them. Post-and-
rail tea numbers its bush loonies by thousands.
Hash-house tea is innocuous, because it mainly
consists of floor-sweepings and boiled leaves that
have been sun-dried again, and curled up by the
oozing perspiration of Chinamen. There s death
and Beelzebub in the family tea-pot, and happy is
he who abjures tea.

America looks ugly. Monopoly of land
and accumulation of wealth are possible up to a
certain point; but America is not like Eng-
land, where an army can be concentrated on any
given point in 48 hours. The strength of the
American army is based on the supposition that it
will have to deal with a people peaceful and law-
abiding. Even a minority of the citizens, if very
much in earnest, can make things highly unplea-
sant for the Government. Let Australia look to
it that her own systems of government do not
repeat the errors which in America drive men to
social revolt.
Editor Bulletin, —In your issue of this
date you state that the Rev. T. B. Tress “ received
an offer of <£6oo and residence from Richmond,
Yic.” As that statement is not true, I must ask
you, in the interest of Mr. Tress, to correct it. The
stipend first offered was >£4oo (not .£600), which
was afterwards increased to £500; but this
amount, from several causes, such as,the different
arrangement that exists in Melbourne as to fees,
the difference in the cost of living, and from
having to leave some members of his family in
Sydney, is not only no inducement but actually
places Mr. Tress in a rather worse financial posi-
tion than he was in Sydney.—l am yours, &c. t

I am Tired !
Sufferers from indigestion and liver complaint at®
subject to a continued feeling of drowsiness, head-
ache, tired aching limbs, and a general inclination
to languor. These symptoms are due primari y
to a deficient secretion of bile, the natural cathartic
of the liver, which, when secreted in insufficient
quantities, permits the coarse and fibrous particles
of the food and other waste and poisonous matter
from all parts of the system to become
impacted in the duodenem and lower intestines,
creating a very dangerous condition which requires
instant and proper treatment. An experience of
five years with Clements Tonic has proved this
remedy a specific for such complaints, and its
universal success has resulted in thousands of
imitations being forced on the market; not because
they possess any therapeutic value, for they are
purely speculative ventures. Sufferers who desire
to get relief must insist on having Clements Tonic.
It acts scientifically, has proved its efficacy in
thousands of cases as effectually as in that of Mr.
C. L. Carter, Queanbeyan, N.S.W., who writes
on May 23rd, 1893 :—I have used your Clements
Tonic with the moat beneficial results. I have
been a severe sufferer for some considerable time
from dyspepsia; I have tried various remedies
without receiving any relief. Hearing so much
about the wonderful cures performed by your
Clements Tonic I resolved to try it, and am happy
to say it done me a lot of good. I can with con-
fidence recommend it to any suffering from dys-
pepsia.—C. L. Carter, Queanbeyan, N.S.W.

UPON BY
MITA'j'IONj,
Society
A will has just turned up, near Melbourne,
dated 1874, which, had it been discovered 19 years
ago, would have been good enough to base a
romance upon. The maker died in 1875, and
under the only will found (dated 1872) disin-
herited her son in favour of her own housekeeper.
The son shot himself, after unsuccessfully trying
to upset the 1872 will, whilst the housekeeper
died from alcoholic poisoning, eight years later,
in Melbourne gaol, without a copper. Under the
later will the son would have got <£9ooo in cash
and a furnished house.

Mdlle. Gdnot, the French lady with the
baggy pants, is pursuing her way through Maori-
land, and her devastating path can be traced by
the paragraphs in the local press. The Maori-
land editors, as a rule, make a great effort to take
the bifurcated visitor seriously, but they are
evidently badly floored by the back view of
mademoiselle when she turns to leave the office.
This isn’t surprising, for there is a shapeless and
cow-like aspect about that back view which is
sufficiently alarming. This is especially the case
when the lady stoops down, under which conditions
sheappears likeagrey feather-bed with boots on. In
Christchurch, where the local girl habituaby rides
a bicycle in a neat knickerbocker suit, the form-
less bagginess of the French lady seems to have
been taken as a personal insult.

Dr. Reunion, Anglican Bishop of Adel-
aide, after a very weak wrestle with the spirit,
has accepted the Bishopric of Bath and Wells at
£5OOO p.a., and as his Adelaide post was only
worth £2OOO a very short wrestle was sufficient.
Dr. Kennion is far from popular in S. A., indeed
the ladies disliked him because he once made ill-
judged remarks about their insincerity as wor-
shippers. His clergy will not be sorry when he
leaves, as on his recent return from England he
commanded them to shave, with the result that
many clerical faces, their “hardness” hitherto
hidden by beards, bore mute testimony that there
was much in the Darwinian theory.
Dr. Kennion has been angling for an English
bishopric for some time, and it was doubtful if he
would return from England on his recent visit,
but “my Lord” denied that he wanted to leave
Australia. Mrs. Kennion is a sister of Sir James
Fergusson, formerly a S.A. Governor, who
perhaps had a little to do with the present
appointment. The bishop is a confirmed Tory
and will be in his element preaching to decrepit
dowagers and decayed dukes at Bath and Wells.

There is joy in Cooktown. A new
Anglican diocese is to be created embracing
northern parts from Cooktown to Port Darwin, and
the southern coast of New Guinea. The grouping
of North Queensland and Southern New Guinea
is a neat piece of sarcasm on the part of the
church authorities. The new diocese will pro-
bably be the most mongrel-ridden district ever
mapped off by sacred or secular authorities.

the slow unfolding of a gorgeous boa-constrictor’e

Melbourne snobs cannot understand that
in the republic of Art a Governor is not necessarily
of any greater consequence that a street musician.
A sill}' groveller who moved a vote of thanks to
Gov. Robinson after the production of the latter’s
opera had the cool impudence to say that H.E.’s
music had all the lightness of Auber and the
French school, with all the delicacy and fanciful-
ness of Arthur Sullivan. Why not all the
grandeur of Wagner, too, and all the sublimity of
Beethoven, and all the beauty of Mozart, and all
the marvellousness of Marshall Hall ?
By the way, when the opera aforesaid was per-
formed before the “select” and invited Melb.
audience, a particular request was made that the
ladies and gentlemen would return the books of
the words at the conclusion. The ladies and
gentlemen at once commenced to smuggle their
copies into their muffs and coat-pockets, and not
half the books were returned.

The W.C.T. Union recently complained
piteously to the Melb. Police Department that
highly indecent pictures were being exhibited in a
certain city hotel. An intelligent constable was
told off to investigate, with the result that he

tionable works of art —they were nothing more,
in fact, than Psyche at Eleusis and the “ Daphne-

A few points for mean men ; Reverse your
hat periodically, wearing it back to front on alter-
nate weeks. Then it is twice as long before the
perspiration-mark in front makes it unwearable.
Never be bow-legged, which is wanton extra-
vagance. The bow-legged man wears the outer
side of his boot-sole, which is its weakest part;
the economical knock-kneed man wears the inner
side, which lasts much longer. Always carry
half-sovereigns; never sovereigns. If you pay
anybody with a sovereign he may give you change
for a half-sov. in spite of your remonstrances ; if
you always give a half-sov., some day or other
somebody will give you change for a whole one
by mistake. If you carry notes always use those
of the most obscure and shaky bank going.
Very often, in panic times, after you
have had a drink or a lunch, the pro-
prietor flatly refuses to take the note of
the shaky little bank. Then you tell him you
have no change and owe hinuthe money. Never
use receipt-stamps. When you sign a receipt put
on the bottom of it a square patch of wet just the
size of a stamp, and let the ends of your name
appear on each side of the damp vacancy. If
this is neatly done, it is apparent that the stamp
was there, but has unfortunately fallen off. Don’t
wear a moustache. The clean-shaved man can
smoke a cigar down to the last quarter-inch, while
the man with a moustache has to sacrifice at least
an inch else his lip ornament will be conflagrated
and the flames will proceed up his nose.

The Duchess of Buckingham, whose en-
gagement to Lord Egerton of Tatton has just
been announced, is a cousin of Governor Hope-
toun. Her determination to re-marry recalls the
saying that “ second marriages are the triumph of
hope over experience.” When she was in Australia
she was chiefly noted for her genial ways and
for her skill in looking at least a decade younger
than her years. Her handsome presence was en-
hanced by a rollicking manner which, on dit,
allowed her to enter into the fun of a pillow-
fight on the mail-boat. In fact, Ann Buckingham,
nee Graham Montgomery, was in every respect
“ awfully jolly.”

There is a Melb. man who, some years
ago, when his wife died, erected a larger tomb-
stone over the grave in place of the diminutive
one which previously bore the name of their child.
He tried to get a substantial rebate for the return
of the old slab, but being offered only 15s. he
concluded to take it home and use it as a “ paste-
board.” Which he did.

Miss Wilson, daughter of Mr. J. A. Wilson, of

Mrs, Windeyer’s project of gazetting the

During the recent N.S.W. election there
appeared in the window of a Sydney assignation
house the placard of a certain Freetrade candidate
with the words: “Vote for . He’s the
Man for Us.” “Us” in this case evidently meant
the tenants of the premises, and when one con
eiders the kind of man who would be the man for
them, and the reasons why he would be that man,
this kind of enthusiasm seems rather rough on the
candidate. It doesn’t help any man on his way
to Parliament to have it publicly announced that
he is cordially approved of in such quarters. It is
as bad as being secretly adopted as a candidate,
without your leave, by the National Ass.

and woman are parts of the same vessel, “jour-
neying o’er life’s solemn main,” and man is linked
to woman as bow is joined to stern—he going
first, she following after. True; sometimes a
vessel moves stern first; but, as a general rule,
man is in advance. The helm is at the stern;
and the helm it is which steadies and controls.
So does conservative woman control and steady
veering, plunging man. But the helmsman is
never captain of the ship, and man remains always
the officer on the bridge.—Yours, A.G.

The Adelaide divorce-suit, Wear v. Wear
and Pophani, the latter a prominent Gawler (S.A.)
medico, about which society has been whispering
for some time, was almost on all-fours with a
recent big London case, and resulted in favour of
Dr. Popham, who was accused by Wear of playing
Adonis with his wife, a fetching Venus of middle
age. The defence was that Mrs. Wear suffered
from epilepsy, and was, therefore, unreliable on
oath. The evidence was unfit for publication, and
the daily papers, therefore, duly published it in
full, with 13 headings and much snuffle.
The big London case aforesaid had one interest-
ing feature of its own. It transpired that the
doctor was in the habit of calling his lady patient
“Dearie,” and when he was asked whether that
was an ordinary practice on the part of medicoes,
he said he believed it was.
The worst feature in the Adelaide case, com-
mented upon by the Judge, was the bringing of a
little girl, not eight years of age, as a witness to
her mother’s alleged dishonour. The jury was
asked to believe that this little child remembered
recognising the doctor’s voice when he visited her
mother years before, when the witness was
only four years old !

When John Downer, Q. 0., went to Eng-
land, some years ago, as S.A. representative to
the Imperial Conference, it was cabled that at the
inaugural meeting he read his speech, because
otherwise he felt that he could not retain suffi-
cent command over his emotions to refrain from
tears. Latterly, the Opposition have been
criticising Playford, tin newly-appointed Agent-
General, and among other things affirmed that he
is not adapted to carry out the ornamental part of
the duties. In reply, Kingston said : “We don’t
want a man with the tone and style of a courtier.
We don’t want a gentleman (‘And you haven’t
got one,’ chipped in Ishmael Grainger) who, every
time he totters with trembling knees into the
august presence of the Secretary of State, has to
put his words in writing lest the solemnity of the
occasion should bring on an irresistible fit of
weeping.” It was noticed that everybody in the
Assembly, except John Downer, laughed just
here.

Dear Bulletin, —It’s only due to “T.G.’s ”

suggest that my skin probably wants washing less

see that I used “rectilinear ” in an approximative
sense only. The rectangular affinities of the
masculine figure, as compared with the feminine,

In a recent English divorce-case, Justice
Jeune “ thought it a most unlikely thing that one
woman should give up her husband to another for
whom she had a great affection. It surpassed
anything that had ever been heard of, even in

at the moment contradict it—there is a new plot

Dear Bulletin, — You are satirical upon
the Melbourne parson who asked, “ Why not have
billiard-tables in the house, where the fathers and
sons can play without the evil associations that
usually accompany the game ?” Well, why not?
Billiards is about the healthiest intellectual
pastime on earth if played by daylight, or even by
gaslight, without the accompaniment of undue
liquor. Good for body and mind. A man who
can play billiards at home is a fool if he prefers to
patronise a public table, apart from the “evil
associations” question. Never mind the associa-
tions—their evilness or otherwise is not to the point
here. I was merely about to say that a billiard-
table in the house has one distinct objection.
Too many “ardent lovers of the game” are
for ever coming up to the house in
search of 100-up gratis. If that Melbourne
parson wishes to preserve a mob of fellow creatures
from the “evil associations” of a pub. billiard-
room, let him by all means have a table in his
home. They’ll come in dozens and bring their
friends with them. They will start by suggesting
one night a week for a pleasant billiard gathering,
and by degrees they will work up to six nights a
week. They will come on Sundays if the parson
isn’t there to stop them. A billiard-table in tin-
home is well-nigh impossible for a good-tempered
father with a large circle of acquaintances. After
a month or two he hasn’t a home left—only a
house and a billiard-table.—A Home Player.

An English court has decided that a cook
can’t be dismissed without notice for smoking in
the kitchen, though the mistress testified that she
was in the habit of inverting the bowl of her pipe
so that the ashes sometimes dropped into the
breakfast. This settles one question anyhow ;
woman has a right to smoke if she wants to. The
burning question now is—does the law recognise
her right to chew tobacco ?

The Queen, a London society paper, asks,
“Are proposals premeditated ? ” It wants to
know whether the average society male gives him-
self away to a girl after serious consideration, or
whether he generally does it on the wild unpre-
meditated hop because he is charmed by the sight
of a pair of white shoulders and a large expanse
of back, and is excited with champagne, and his
head is going round with the giddy waltz. The
balance of probability is that some proposals are
unpremeditated, and are mainly owing to a great
unsurveyed allotment of skin on the upper part of
the lady, and that some, especially in the case of
girls with freckles, are done after serious and pro-
found thought. A much more interesting ques-
tion is—which suitor feels himself a bigger and
more complete ass after the event ? Probably
both of them do.

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHAT IS IT 7
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding' and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a had article for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you ? Will you do your business at

VOU, of course, want the highest quality of tone, action,

you MUST have DURABILITY. Durability is an indispensable

without durability it is worthless. Avoid the cheap

class maker. Therefore, no matter how big a bargain you
think somebody else offers, investigate

One school of scientists asserts that the
lives of hospital nurses are greatly curtailed by
their occupation.
A healthy girl of 17, devoting herself to hospital nurs-
ing, dies, on an average, 21 years sooner than a girl of
the same age moving among the general population. A
hospital nurse, at the age of 25, has the same expectation
of life as a person of the age of 58 in the ordinary com-
munity.
Will the life-insurance actuaries and capable
physiologists endorse this gloomy view of a pro-
fession which is becoming a craze amongst even
society girls? If so, the contest for nursing
vacancies will resolve itself into a struggle between

PAT: “Spake to the droiver; I’m the horse.”
Lurking Death and Feminine Desire for For-
bidden Knowledge! Speaking bluntly, the spur
that first animates nursing volunteers is not
philanthropy, not womanly kindness, not a thirst
for noble deeds, nor even the mere desire to make
an independent living, but a craving for that sort
of knowledge which a mistaken social system
hides from maidenhood under hermetical seals.
Hence the vulgar and universal, if brutal, belief :
“ Wot a trained nuss dunno, ain’t wuth knowin’.”

BECAUSE they have the best reputation ana
are most in demand by the public, consequently,
every dishonest trader tries to trade on their
fame and renown.
It is really wonderful that the Australian people
are so slow to see the truth as regards the un-
scrupulous quacks and charlatans who prey on the
credulity of the Australian public. Scarcely a
week ever passes but what the press exposes the
bare-faced and shameful practices of some of these
harpies, yet, in face of all they seem to thrive,
and the paper who hounds them down most
thrives fattest on their advertisements and cracks
champagne over each balance-sheet. Clements
Tonic and Fletcher’s Fills have never yet stooped
to_ deception and misrepresentation. They are
scientific therapeutical agents, and evidence as
to their value can be found in every district, and
such being the case it is unnecessary to further
extol their virtues.

Napoleon Bonaparte I,
EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH.
THE SECRET OF HIS SUCCESS.
How he Preserved his Nervous System.
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE, second son of
Charles Bonaparte and his wife, Letizia de
Ratnolins, was born at Ajaccio, in Corsica, on the
15th of August, 1769. In the year 1779 he entered
the Royal Military School of Brienne le Chateau.
There he remained till the autumn of 1784, when
he was transferred to the Military School of Paris,
according to the usual routine. He lost his father
in 1785, and the same year he was commissioned
a second lieutenant of artillery, and served as such
at Valence and other garrisons.
Napoleon attempted to obtain military power
in Corsica, but having failed, he fled to France,
where his career as a soldier and leader of men
became the most wonderful known to history, both
before and after that period. He was soon pro-
moted to chef de batallion, and commanded the
artillery at the siege of Toulon, where he highly
distinguished himself, and was the author of the
plan of attack which led to the fall of the place.
He was then promoted general of brigade.
On the fall of Robespierre, Napoleon was ordered
to take command of an infantry brigade in the
Army of the West. Thinking this beneath his
dignity, he refused to comply with the order, and
was discharged as a general. He was, however,
appointed second in command of the Army of the
Interior, Oct. 5, 1795, under Barras, and repelled
next day an attack of the sections of Paris.
Napoleon was appointed to the command of the
Army of Italy, Feb. 23, 1796; he married on
March 9, same year, Josephine Tascher de la
Pagorie, widow of General Victome Alexandra
de Beauharnais, and left Paris immediately for
Italy. Napoleon’s great military genius flashed
forth in its full brilliancy in this his first
campaign. His power lay in the rapidity and
boldness of his decisions, and in the untiring
energy with which he carried them out, confound-
ing his enemies by the suddenness and lightning
rapidity of his blows, which never gave them time
to recover. He performed a very clever move, by
penetrating the point of junction of two strong
armies which were opposing the French army, the
one consisting of 20,000 Piedmontese under Colli,
the other of 38,000 Austrians, under Beaulieu, and
succeeded most wonderfully, although the French
army was only 36,000 strong.
From now his career was one continuation of
triumphal successes, until almost the whole of
Europe and other important parts of the world
was at his mercy. He soon became elected First
Consul for life, and in 1804 he assumed the title of
Emperor, and this was decreed by the Senate
shortly afterwards. The institutions which he
created, and which still remain, were the restored
church, the judicial system, the codes, the system
of Local Government, the University, the Bank
of France and the Legion of Honour. Space will
not permit to describe his unfortunate end, but
suffice it to say, that the wonderful nerve-power,
which he possessed and preserved to the last, was
absolutely due to a secret medical preparation
discovered in Corsica, by a medical relation of his,
and without which his nerves would have been
shattered long before he had reached his great
triumphs.
This great nerve invigorator is known as the
Napoleon Vigour Powder, and is now being intro-
duced into Australia, the sole Australian agents
being The Imperial Drug Company, 239 Eliza-
beth-street (near Bathurst-street), Sydney, who
will forward free pamphlets and all particulars on
application.
The Napoleon Vigor Powder is simply marvel-
lous for restoring a broken-down nervous system,
either brought on through early follies or other-
wise, and an excellent preventative against and
cure for nervousness, despondency, melancholia,
lost vitality and debility. The remedy is sold in
boxes at 65., or in courses of 5 boxes at 255. Double
course, 455. posted. Pamphlets, remedies, &c.,
and all particulars sent strictly unobserved by the
agents, the Imperial Drug Co., 239 Elizabeth-street,
Sydney, to whom all cheques, Post Office money-
orders, postal notes, &c., should be made payable.

Dear Bulletin, —Four people at Inverell
were responsible for 8 out of 23 successful guesses
in your last Missing Word competition. Inverell
must be a darned lucky place to live in. Could
you oblige a Constant Reader with figures, showing
the percentage of correct guesses produced by this
not very large town, and particulars of the
natural features of the district ? I think
I have noticed, too, that Young is a
good town for guessing in. How do you
account for these things ?—Constant Reader.
[The Bulletin doesn’t profess to be able to fully
account for those things. Perhaps, however, the
lucky Mr. MTlveen invested in many guesses on
the strength of his first big win of £l5O. Possi-
bly some light is thrown on the Inverell wins by
the following note, received, last week, from Mr.
MTlveen aforesaid, who, it would appear from
his letter-heading, is a “ share-broker, stock and
station and mining agent, and auctioneer,” at
Inverell]: —
Editor Bulletin, —Am glad to see that I have again
been successful. Kindly hand the odd lie. 3d. to the
postman. One at least of the three other winning guessers
here owes his success to an admission made by me to a
friend, not thinking it would be taken advantage of, that
my pet word contained five “i’s.” An interview with the
dictionary did the rest.—J. MTlveen. Inverell, July 7,
1894.
“ Titus Salt ” in reply : ,
Dear Bulletin,— l will endeavour to make my answer
to Mr. Collins as brief as possible. Mr. Collins’ theory
is that the “ moral tone" nation is the most durable and
the best fighting material; mine is that the crowd which
has a moral tone, and the crowd which hasn’t one, take
an equal chance, and come out much the same in the end.
As regards his particular instances: (1) There is no evi-
dence that the Macedonians were a moral race ; it was
the Macedonian phalanx, not the Macedonian morals,
which swamped Sparta. Also, the generalship of Philip l
had something to do with it. (2) Dunbar wat a generals’,
not a soldiers’, battle. So was Naseby. So were most'
other battles. The Ironsides carried all before them, not
because of their morality, but because of the splendid
generalship of Cromwell. When their moral descendants,
under the moral William 111., met the dissolute
Household troops of Louis XIV. under Luxembourg, who
was a brilliant general and a rake of the worst order, they
went to unutterable smash. When they were led by
Marlborough, who was the greatest leader and about the
worst villain of his time, they were victorious. When
their descendants, again, under the Duke of York, ran up
against the descendants of the men whom Marlborough
conquered, led by such generals as Pichbqru, they went
under. The generals, not the morals, were responsible
every time. (2) Tom Collins asks, re the Janizaries,
“ VVher is dot barty now ?’’ Well, the Janizaries are just
where the Ironsides and the Huguenots and the Pilgrim
Fathers are—dead. But the last of them died fighting
grimly against stupendous odds, and, as far as pluck was
concerned, they never degenerated anyhow. (3) Brother
Collins asks me to compare Massachusetts with Mexico
and see whether the moral or the immoral lot—the sons of
the Pilgrims or the sons of the riff-raff who followed Cortez
—will survive. 1 have compared them, and the result is
an open question. As far as can be estimated from the
available figures—the Pilgrims, if left to themselves,
would have about died out. The tendency to die out
among their descendants is very marked, and if it were
not for the constant stream of foreign immigration it
would probably be very hard to find even the semblance
of an alleged Pilgrim now. Even as it is, New England,
the land of the Pilgrim Fathers, is fast degenerating into
a wilderness of deserted farms and abandoned agricul-
tural lands, and its condition is one of the apparently
unsolvable problems of the Union. At all events, the
present Mexicans are a happier race, and have evolved a
vastly less corrupt system of Government, than the
alleged sons of the Pilgrims, and as to their great men,
Massachusetts never produced so great a man as Juarez,
and 1 don’t think it produced any greater than Miguel
Hidalgo or Porkirio Diaz. If Tom Collins estimates the
Mexican from the typical “greaser” in the American
western drama, or from American border literature, or
from American ideas generally, he is very far astray. (4)
Even granting that Sparta was all that Tom Collins
claims-which it wasn’t—what was its fighting record
compared to that of the Six Nations whose handful of
warriors dominated all the country from the St. Lawrence
to Virginia for at least two centuries? And if they were
moral, the fact has somehow been left out of history.
Also, the Greek, who survived 400 years of foreign
tyranny, was not the moral Spartan, but the hideously
immoral wreckage of the Lower Empire. lam perfectly
willing to admit that the moral men and the moral races
of this world have left a splendid record behind them.
But the immoral races and the immoral men have done
likewise, and the results, so far as I can see, are about
equal.
Dear Bulletin, — Be the Piddington inci-
dent. Despite Dr. M'Laurin’s disclaimer as one
who knew of no undue influence, the business
looks and smells fishy. Piddington might have
been a bona-fide civil servant, and the Sydney
University Senate might have been quite right in
holding that their paid servants should not sit in
Parliament; but they should serve all with the
same sauce. One University professor is a member
of N.S.W. Leg. Council, and two of the lecturers
sat in the late Assembly. The seat of one of these
latter was actually challenged on the ground that
he was a paid public servant, but it was held that
he was not the holder of “ an office of profit under
the Crown.” How does this square with Pickling -
ton’s case ?—Y,
Stead’s book about Chicago is dull stuff,
after all —boom et prceterea precious little. Stead
has been a bright writer in his time ; but it looks
as if he had written himself out. His Review,
which at first was readable, has grown into a
dreary magazine of clippings, and the introduc-
tory articles are heavy as lead. There is a Non-
conformist blight on it. Luckily, Stead has earned
name and fame as the boss exploiter of the Non-
conformist conscience, and is under no risk of
ending his days in a poor-house. What is chiefly
evident in “ If Christead came to Chicago ” is the
height and depth and breadth and thickness of
Stead’s knowledge of the Scarlet Woman. The
book is a splendid advertisement for Chicago
bagnios. A scarlet plan is prefaced, which
tells strangers exactly where they are to go,
and interesting descriptions of the “ best houses ”
follow, with names and all necessary details. The
Scarlet Woman is introduced at the beginning of
the book, and Stead is continually harking back to
the congenial subject. Sketches of municipal cor-
ruption flit casually across the foreground, but
She of Babylon remains always behind, vast and
magnificent. Off the Scarlet Woman, Stead does
not do himself justice. As the Chicago press
said, there is nothing new in the book, though the
exposure of boodling is novel. But there is one
thing abundantly clear, which is that Stead had a
devil of a good time in Chicago.
The half-yearly div. of the IS.Z. Insurance
Co., at the rate of 12\ per cent, per an., is now pay-
able. Last year the available balance, after
paying all losses and defraying all expenses, was
.£71,703 10s. 5d., out of which the shareholders
received £27,500 in divs. and bonus. Recognising
the possible depreciation of investments, the
directors wisely allotted £lO,OOO to investment
fluctuation account, and £15,000 for depreciation
of investments, which left a balance of £19,203
10s. sd. to be carried forward. These figures
speak volumes in favour of the management of the
company, and the shareholders are to be con-
gratulated for having invested their funds in a
company whose business is conducted on so sound
and careful a basis. The New Zealand Insurance
Company is the oldest and largest company of
the kind in New Zealand, and from its commence-
ment has been deservedly popular in that colony.
The market price of its shares is 50 per cent, above
par. The head office of the company is at Auck-
land. Mr. Warwick Weston, general manager.
It has branches and agencies in all the colonies.

M’Burney, Wallis & Co.’s Report.
We are pleased to be able to state that good news from
London still continues to arrive, the recent rise in wool
being fully maintained.
At our local auctions this week the demand was strong
and sales readily effected. In addition to the usual odd
lots of greasy, and country and local scoured, a few clips
of new wool passed under the hammer, and for these bid-
ding was very animated, with a consequence that they
realised more money than when disposed of hers last
year. This gives good promise for the approaching season,
and we must again state that everything seems to point
to a slight increase in prices for the clip of 1894-6.
The shearing trouble seems to have ended in smoke,
and we must congratulate shearers upon their good sense
in keeping out of the clutches of long-winded agitators.
It is now almost a certainty that our market in the
coming season will he patronised by American buyers,
and with wool on the free list and the Yankee presence in
oursale-Doom, must give a big stimulus to business.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The V.B.C. Grand Nat. Steeplechase was
another sermon on the vanity of early fancies for a
jumping handicap, in which weight may mean more or
less, just according to the state of the weather. This
time the ground, as it happened, was all in favour of the
least-known performers that had the least to carry, and a
9st. 3lbs. winner was followed home by four other bottom
weights. Four favourites, including the “ pot,” Coranga,-
mite, fell during the races, and two more of the fancied
ones—Busaco and Medicine—came in lame. The greatest
disappointment was Actress, the handsome S.A. mare,
who looked in good condition, but appeared quite unable
to gallop through the mud.
Glenview, the despised outsider of them all,
managed to get round the course. Miller, junr., of the
show-printing firm, had a commission to back Glenview
for a lady. She had dreamed it and she wanted five
shillings on. So the commissioner went around the
paddock, rejecting miserable offers of 25 to 1 (the highest
price some of them were laying about anything), until he
found a broad-minded Hebrew who was_ prepared to do
the handsome thing. “ Glenview 1” said the reckless
metallician, “give us your half-sovereign, take this ticket
in your left hand, and write down your own price. God
bless you!” So Miller modestly wrote down the wager at
fifties, although he might as well have laid himself a
quarter of a million sterling to the five bob.

*The “books” laid preposterously short prices
throughout the Plemington O.N. meeting. Even the
published odds, which, in nearly all cases, are more than
a punter can obtain about his fancy, showed the folly of
investing a pound with Ikey Mo for the alleged benefit
(t ride Frank Madden) of a small ring of horse-owners.
On Thursday, before the Steeplechase, the newspaper
odds placed Ikey on velvet after laying the first 15 horses
on the list. The odds to £5OO against each of the fifteen
would leave him a sure winner of from £25 to £9O by the
success of any one of them, whilst the_ remaining nine
horses quoted could be running for a “ skinner.”

Mat Dawson, the trainer of Ladas, has been 54
years in the business. He and Mrs. Mat are a “ golden-
wedding” couple, the result of early hours throughout a
breezy bracing life. No fashionable Australian trainer
can hope to last like the Dawsons, Days, and Scolls until
the local whisky improves in quality. These old horsey
identities are good judges of their own blood stock (which
is food and liquor) as well as the equine article.
* * * •
The Bulletin surmised truly that the scratch-
ing of Ladas for Ascot engagements had_ nothing to do
with the shrieks of chapel piety. Speaking at the Eton
celebration on June 4th old-boy Eosebery said : “Never
did I expect to hear I he Provost of Eton congratulate one
of his past pupils on his prospects of winning the Derby.
This is a benediction which should reach far and bring
luck, and lam bound to say-I take this public oppor-
tunity of saying it in answer to representations that have
reached me from various sources, one of them only yester-
day from the secretary of the Anti-Gambling Society—
that I feel no vestige of shame in possessing a good
horse.”
One of the biggest winners on Ladas Derby
was Lord Rosebery’s youthful daughter. Fry, the
leviathan British bookie, was her victim. When he paid
over the £9OOO to Miss Primrose’s commissioner he re-
marked, “ I must have been a myg to lay a big bet like
that (to a bloomin' infant, even) who’s a cross between a
Scotchman and a Jew.”

The pen was put through all Mr. W. A. Dong’s
entries (or Warwick Farm last Saturday, and Rosehill
next Saturday, owing to the death of his mother. Mr.
Long’s sporting proclivities come from the deceased lady s
side of the house. Old “Bill” had a horror of horse-
racing and it was not until his father s death that young
“ Bill ” went on the turf. Mr. Long’s uncle, the father,
by the way. of Mr. W. B. Walford, treasurer of the
A J 0., was the best amateur boxer in Tasmania—in fact,
it was pretty well conceded that there was not a man in
the island, amateur or professional, able to beat him, with
or without the mittens.

It is nob often a horse wins a treble on the one,

The Victorian Governor’s eldest son followed
the hounds for the first time last week, when the “ Mel-
bourne,” under George Watson, scoured the Wernbee.
The nine-year-old hunter rode on to the death, his only
disposition to swerve being from the groom and bearing
rein with which he had been discreetly provided. Hif
mother urged his release; his father thought it wiser fo»
the groom to hold on. As a set-off the youthful sport
was allowed to carry home fch© head of thedeerin triumph
at his saddle-bow. Athletics are coming out strongly ir
this scion of the house of Hopetoun ; haying no playmate!
of his own he may sometimes be seen kicking a football

At a Maoriland junior football-match a local
man awkwardly missed aim, and, hitting the ball with the
side of his foot, skied it over his head and took his own
side’s goal. The umpire ruled that the goal counted for
the other side. This is regarded as funny by several
critics, but isn’t it merely analogous to a cricket-batsman
knocking down his own wickets when playing a ball too
far back, or playing a ball on to a wicket?

Donald lately has been appearing with a poor variety co.,

Surely he is as great a celebrity (in his own line) as

Some weeks or months ago a well-known Syd-

whilst more or less excited, £lOOO in billiard-wagers at
a certain club. A dispute arose as to payment of the
njoney—and the club committee decided that he would
have to pay. The sportsman to whom the money was
lost refused to compound for an amount which the loser
offered. “ Very well,” said the latter, “If you don’t take
that you may get nothing. lam about to undergo an
operation which may kill me. Take it or leave it." The
winner left it, thinking—smart man!—that the operation
story was “ all bluff.” The operation was performed and

lb is surely time the Australian public palled on
the Jim Burge slaughters. They are the essence of
brutality. There is no pretence of a contest, the old
warrior simply undertaking to take the place of a punch-
ing bag for 79 minutes. Last week in Melbourne a deaf
mute smashed him about in a terrible manner for the 20
rounds, but as Burge could stagger to his feet at the con-
clusion it was called a “ draw.” Friday O’Neill is now
billed to smash up Burge—and his hands—for 20 rounds.
A Black Country shin-kicking match would relieve the

Tim Hegarty, the clever Melb. featherweight,
won the championship of that class last Saturday night
by defeating Jack M'Gowan, on points. Hegarty, whose
peculiar tight with Willis a week or two ago will be
remembered, is a lightning boxer, though he hits less
hard than some men of his weight. In a large ring he
should have no difficulty in keeping his present position,
as he is a quiet boy and not given to “ Griffo ” outbursts.
Good Australian pugilists goto America—before
they die. Tut Ryan, whom Mick Dooley defeated recently
for the championship, is the latest scrapper with trans-
pacific intentions. Ryan, unlike many of his confreres,
is a teetotaller and non-smoker, and should be successful
in Yankeeland.

The Calif/raph Writing Machine,
v-
THE CaLIGRAFH embodies all the highest
developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors.
“I like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. The
result is attributable to the fact that th* platen of
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but one
fitted with the ordinary round platen. When you
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and the rest to the left, you
may be sure that yonr correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their type
out of perpendicular. Then remember that the
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every-
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
able bearings.
The Caligraph manifolds 15 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

Dear Bulletin,— The 1.0.G.T. claims to
be on the warpath, and intends an invasion of the
electioneering stump. It lias held a boss-meeting
of lodge officers styled “electoral deputies.” The
duties of these deputies are, generally, to see that
all Good Templars are enrolled and have their
votes secure, and then to try and enthuse them
into voting each for the “ right man ” in his elec-
toral district. My experience of Good Templars,
as voters and I have held office in the Order —is
that their block vote is worth—just nil. Given a
Good Templar who is a conscientious Freetrader,
and he will sooner vote for a beer-guzzling Free-
trader than a water-soaked Protectionist ; and
vice versa. Few, indeed, are the Good Templars
with whom several political issues do not over-
shadow the mere question of teetotal ethics. Many
are theG.T. s who merely join lodges because they
are canny in money matters and yet hanker after
cheap amusement and feminine society. The
lodge-rooms are splendid spooning-places. I
speak by the card. Not 5, not 2 per cent, of the
Good Templars, taking them all round—the luke-
warm, the expediency-mongers, and the earnest
cranks—-really thrill with the idea that they are
atoms in a moral, elevating and regenerating

I know them. They love music-halls songs better
than temperance ditties, and politics of a general

The biggest vine in Victoria is in the
vineyard of L. Giizzi, near Huntley. It trellises
over 35 sq. yds., and, last year, gave 2| tons of
grapes, which yielded 6 hhds. of wine.
A Monaro correspondent:—“ A new man-
ager has arisen to follow ‘ Old Man Mac,’ of Dele-
gate (N.S. W.) Station, This truly grand old man,
known and loved all over Monaro as ‘Old Man
Mac,’ was an identity of over 50 years’ standing as
manager of the station. He was like a father to
the district. Many a man has Mac. gratuitously
set on his feet in this region in days when doctors
were unheard of here. Old Alexander M‘Keachie
was regretted by all.
Editor Bulletin’, —When a man speaks of
patting 8 bags of flour—l6ool bs.—on a camel, and
says the beast got up with the load, it’s about time
the brake was applied. Remember that a camel’s
legs are never thicker than, and certainly not so
muscular as, those of an ordinary Clydesdale horse.
The maximum loads allowed for pack animals are
—elephant, 11201bs. ; camel, 6401b5. ; horse or
mule, according to size, 200 to 3001b5.; bullock, 160
to 2401b5. These are maximum loads, and any-
body looking at a camel will see that he cannot be
expected to carry more than twice as much as a
horse. No camel is so tall as a large elephant—
10ft. or lift, to the top of the shoulder, the hump
is little else than a mass of fat, while its mus-
cular tissue is little more bulky than that of a
d raugh t-horse. —U NT.
Premier Kingston, who once opposed free
education, gave reasons in S.A. Assembly recently
for supporting the system now it has become law.
“ I hope I shall never have to fall back on so lame
an excuse,” exclaimed Griffiths, the Whip of the
party which seeks to upset the Act. “ Don’t be to
sanguine,” advised the Premier good-temperedly.
Whereupon, with a sneer, quoth Solomon : “Evil
communications corrupt good manners.”’ “ Yes,’
responded Kingston, “he is your colleague.”
“Sol” and “Griff ” jointly represent the Northern
Territory —about the biggest single constituency
in the world.
Drake, the Q. Oppositionist, says that in
England he found that people didn’t know there
was any Q. Opposition. The little ring of
absentees who represent “kawlonial opinion”
spread the good tidings of Boodle wraith so
zealously, that the average person is under
the impression that Boodlewraith is supreme, and
that the Labour-party and the Opposition are
only insignificant sections of the people, who
prefer to worship the same deity in their own way.
Even in Sydney Drake found things the same.
Talking to a friend, he happened to mention the
Q. Opposition. “Why,” said the friend, “I
thought there was no Opposition.” “ Who told
you?” “Oh, Mr. Tozer !”
Apropos of the spread of education. There
is a shepherd out towards the Diamantina to whom
reading and writing are equally strangers. He has a
hut on a lonesome part of the run, but even there
the swagger comes along now and then and
demands provender. Generally the shepherd is
out, and then the gaunt wanderer sometimes
bursts the door in and clears the premises. The
last time this happened the shepherd lost patience,
and after that, when he left the hut, he would put
his victuals in a candle-box and plant it carefully
in a hole out in the paddock. The second day
after he adopted this device a sundowner arrived
and rummaged the premises, then finding nothing
he gave way to fury and wrote a quantity of most
unpublishable Barcoo language on the door
with a burnt stick. The reflections which he
put on that door were beyond the power of
any mere city man to express in language. A few
hours later the shepherd came home, and, after
long and serious consideration of the hierogly-
phics, he decided that they were most probably
an important message from the manager. Accord-
ingly, he took the portal off its hinges of green
liide and carried it five miles to a camp of tank-
sinkers to have it deciphered. Eight riba,ld pick-
and-shovel men bore a hand in reading the
message, amid the obscene merriment of the camp,
and when they were through the shepherd broke
the door into flinders against a tree, bounded on
his hat, and poured forth an objurgation which
made even the tank-sinkers fly for their lives.
He is now learning the alphabet off the brands on
an old bullock-hide, so that he may decipher the
next swagman’s message himself and go in im-
mediate pursuit of the offender.


Parkes has been bombarded with con-
gratulations on the attainment of his 79th birth-
day last Sunday. A Sydney D.T. interviewer
went with a blithesome, springy step to dive into
the old man’s recollections of infancy, and ex-
tracted much information regarding his capacity
for goo-goo utterance and mud-pie manufac-
ture. Singularly enough, however, the veteran
omitted the one thing material, and did not say
that he owes his strength and health, under Pro-
vidence, to a judicious use of Marshall’s Tonic
Nervine, sold at corner of Pitt and Park streets,
Sydney.

“ An Unequal Match,” staged on Saturday
at Sydney Criterion, is one of those quaint, old-
world comedies, belonging to an almost forgotten
variety of literature, which used to be called comic
something like 30 years ago. To-day it is hope-
lessly out of date as a comedy, and it is hardly a
drama, and it doesn’t fill the bill as a society play.
Nevertheless, it is an exceedingly pretty love-
story in three acts, and calculated to please any
one who has some semblance of poetry in his soul.
In the first act the author arises and shows how
the British baronet of great possessions loved and
married the beautiful daughter of the blacksmith,
and took her away to let loose her Yorkshire
accent in his ancestral halls. The experiment
pans out only moderately well, for the lady, in
her efforts to fit_ herself for her new station,
smites the piano with an arm of might at 5 a.m.,
and otherwise misconducts herself. Then the
experiment succeeds altogether too well, for the
blacksmith’s daughter becomes a society lady of
so stupendous a type that the baronet is utterly
crushed beneath the weight of her dignity, and
instead of lecturing her for her want of tone, he
finds himself admonished in a frozen fashion for
his own.
• • •
The fact that the baronet ia the sketchy
Mr. Greenaway reconciles the audience consider-
ably tootle fate which descends on his brief and
unconvincing head. It is Greenaway’s misfortune,
somehow, always to seem sketchy and unfinished,
and to look as if he was only printed on one side ;
also, he imparts a vague idea of having been
picked before he was ripe. Miss Hilda Spong,
however, compensates for his little deficiencies.
She is pretty and graceful as the blacksmith’s
daughter, though the Yorkshire accent is a strange
and awful circumstance; and later on she
developes into a personage whom every individual
in the house gets mashed on straight away. The
Bulletin contemplates making some poetry
about Miss Hilda when the election is fairly
over and its boots come back from being
mended. Harry Leston makes a large,
loose, sloppy flunkey, who is all that a flunkey
should be. Miss Fitzmaurioe Gill—the lady with
the ancient Egyptian oast of countenance—is a
moderate success as a female of execrable charac-
ter ; and this paper would like to say something
kind about Mr. Fabert, a highly-intelligent actor
with an aggravating stoniness of expression which
suggests road-metal. Some of Spong’s finest
scenery is put into this production, particularly a
view of one of those small German kingdoms
where an athletic person can stand in the centre
and heave coal into all the adjacent States.
“ Pygmalion and Galatea ” ia announced for next
Saturday, and The Bulletin is haunted by a fear
that Mr. Greenaway intends to be Pygmalion.
** * *
Feeling it necessary fco do something to
demonstrate the perpetual fitness of things, Mr.
Rignold has staged “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” at Syd-
ney Majesty’s, and the frozen Ohio river, over
which Miss Watts-Phillips effects her escape,
makes the wintry audience feel as if the key of the
front door had been mislaid down its back. But
to compensate for this coolness, Uncle Tom is sold
each evening to Albert Marsh, the warmth of
whose language is sufficient compensation for any-
thing. Mr. Marsh is one of the most whole-souled
and satisfactory villains on the Australian stage,
and the wickedness of the drama rests mostly on
his shoulders, the other ruffian having a bad habit
of talking as if his mouth were full of corn, which
seriously diminishes his effectiveness. The un-
satisfactory feature of “ Uncle Tom ” is that, of
the innumerable characters in the drama, the
great majority only flit across the stage and dis-
appear. The two tame dogs, which start after
Miss Watts-Phillips, presently wander into the
wings and vanish. The ruffian with the in-
djstinct utterance is thrown down a preci-
pice, and leaves his brains on the scenery.
Topsy, in the person of Miss Emma Chambers,
breaks things to a song-and-dance accompaniment
for one exciting half-hour, and then retires, and
little Eva is fetched away by the angels a few
minutes before 10. This is a realistic effect, a
patch of Paradise being visible at the back of the
stage, and if George Rignold were seen in the far
distance as an archangel, the effect would be com-
plete. The same lot of angels—one of whom
giggles violently all the time—call for Uncle Tom
about 11, and take that dreadful black elocutionist
up aloft. Hosea Easton’s nigger, if he is memor-
able for anything at all, will be remembered as
the most un-eloquent nigger on record. A lot of
Jubilee singers have been laid on, and there is
enough singing, step-dancing, and general revelry
to make a high-class variety-show. Most of the
17 scenes are works of art, and in a general way
the management has put on the drama with a fixed
resolve to make it a success, or else die and go to
heaven along with little Eva in the attempt.
** * *
The Prodigal Daughter,” at Sydney
Lyceum, is on the high tide of success, and the
Duke wins the Grand National Steeplechase every
evening with a regularity which makes backers
long to meet with a horse like him at Randwick.
One notable example of Bland Holt’s realism is
the crowd which gathers at the racecourse to yell
when this noble animal comes in first with Sass
on his back. It can be confidently recommended
as a typical racecourse crowd, for there isn’t one
face in the lurid gathering which shouldn’t get its
owner six months without the option. If this
isn’t a typical racecourse crowd it is difficult to
imagine what is one. This paper still regards Mr.
Cosgrove with a hollow stare of unbelief, and it
isn’t so sure as it might be about Miss Henrietta
Watson’s heavy father, the old English squire ;
but otherwise it regards the show with a favour-
able eye and bestows its blessing upon it.

Frank Emery had a benefit on Tuesday of
last week at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), which
panned out a handsome cheque for the beneficiare.
The show consisted of the tunnel scene in “ After
Dark,” wherein George Rignold drags Scot Inglis
froth beneath the wheels of the untamed paste-
board locomotive; one act of “As You Like it,”
by Miss Hilda Spong and Oo.; the one-aot play,
14 A Clerical Error,” wherein Mr. Emery made an
excellent impression as the drinky butler; sundry
songs by Harry Rickards and others; and the
comedietta “A Happy Medium.” This last was
tackled by an amateur company, of whom Miss
Ina Wild man earned most commendations.

The music of Gov. Robinson’s opera,
“Predatoros,” is an improvement on the libretto.
That is about the baldest rehash of bandits, moun-
tain surprises, lovelorn maidens, fat old fathers,
and sentimental mothers that have pranced about
the stage since Gilbert and Sullivan put them
there. “Predatoros ”is miles behind any of them.
The ballads are the nicest things about Gov. W.
Robinson’s part of the business. Of these, there
are about a baker’s dozen, and as they are all
pretty much alike they will be easy enough to
learn.
** * *
Governor Robinson’s opera may seem dull
enough, but the process of manufacture was
supremely comic. The author privileged to colla-
borate with “Sir William ” in this great work is
a Mr. Hart—the same Hart, possibly, who erst-
while served as Melbourne press interpreter for
Johnny Toole’s practical jokes, and who imper-
sonated the bursts of merriment when that funny
old man used to walk into a tailor’s shop to buy a
box of cough-lozenges. Hart having become the
Gov. ’s Jester, a Bureau of Libretti, or some similar
public department, was invented for his benefit by
the Westralian Government, and in his capacity
of Bureaucrat the literary wag brought his brain
to bear upon Robinson’s opera. Meanwhile the
musician wrestled with the same matter in his com-
posing-room at Government House, the Bureau
and the vice-regal den being connected by tele-
phone. As soon as Hart had completed a new
lyrio he rang up his noble patron and breathed
the sparkling lines down the tube, where-
upon a voice from afar spluttered, “beautiful!”
“charming,” or “exceedingly quaintand catchy,”
as the case might be. Presently Hart would be
rung up to listen to the bit of music his Excellency
had dashed off in his latest fit of inspiration. The
strains of Sir William’s piano floated up the tele-
phone spout and flooded the Bureau with melody.
Then Hart in his turn answered, “delicious,”
“enchanting,” or “ bright and spirited,” according
to circumstances. And thus the concoction of the
opera proceeded on a sound mutual admiration
system, _ _ The collaborateurs never quarrelled
or criticised each other’s contributions, like,
Gilbert and Sullivan. The course of telephone
composition was interrupted only by Sir William’s
fracious, “See you to-night, I suppose;” to which
[art invariably replied, “ Your Excellency is too
good.” Lie.
** * *
Melbourne shows are much the same as
last week. At the Alexandra, however, they have
renounced “Ally Sloper” and revived Dan
Barry’s own particular setting of “After Dark,”
which is again famous for the mad career of its
cardboard train. The rolling stock on the Alex-
andra railway line is not content with a simple
roll. It also pitches and tosses in a briny manner,
so that if the orchestra were to strike up “A
Life on the Wave,” and Dan Barry flew to the
rescue on a raft, it would seem as though a drown-
ing Major Chomley had been saved from mutila-
tion by a passing steam-boat. The music-hall scene
now includes a ballet, lightly clad, but fairly
heavy in movement. The ballet damsels, having
concluded their entertainment, drop into easy
attitudes among the audience, and the villain,
who glances suspiciously at these innocent-seeming
young creatures, is assured by his guilty colleague
that they have all been in trouble for something
or other. Which is a nasty knock for stage
morality. _ “ After Dark ” may run for a second
week, but in any case the management has a large
stock of revivals ready to hand.
** * *
“Ma Mie Rosette ” booms without ceas-
ing at the Princess’s. Its last nights have been
announced for some time past, yet the tail-end of
them had not come into sight at time of writing.
The opera season itself is understood to be closing
on the 27th, and, in that case, the pretty story of
what might have happened to Nellie Stewart if
she hadn’t fainted before it came to pass might as
well hold the boards until then. There is no
occasion to withdraw “Ma Mie Rosette” in the
pride of its popularity. Nellie grows nicer than
ever, if that is possible. Also, Florence Young is
a growing matter for admiration, and Tapley
improves with practice.
** » *
“A King of Crime” goes on smiting his
enemies at Melbourne Royal, and the corpse of
the curdled traitor welters in its gore without fail.
Nobody mourns for this departed brother, or
troubles to carry his remains to the morgue,
although he was shouting bottled toast and water
for the populace five minutes before the King
stiffened him. On the stroke of midnight a troupe
of gay masqueraders dance a can-can without any
consideration for the presence of death in their
midst, so it must often occur to the poor traitor
that he died in vain. He might as well have been
not assassinated a little bit, for all the notice that
they bestow on his remains. Charles Holloway,
the King, absorbs all the honour, and glory, and
red light. From first to last his domestic virtues
and criminal excellence hold the gallery en-
thralled. Some of the King’s popularity is re-
flected upon his gentle blind wife, owing to a
cheerful suspicion that he really gouged out her
eyesight before the curtain rose in order to dis-
tract her attention from his burglarious wig. The
next play on the Royal list is “ A Grip of Iron,”
promised for Saturday.

Young Percy Grainger, latest of Austra-
lian composers and pianists, made his first appear-
ance at a recent Melbourne concert. He com-
pleted his Bach numbers with an absence of self-
consciousness as delightful as his mastery over the
music was wonderful. He seemed to be a good
deal more interested in the construction of the
laurel-wreath that his discoverer, Dr. O’Hara,
presented, than in his own performance after it was
over. He hadn’t a note before him, but the music
fell from his fingers as though he made it as he
went along. Little Grainger was born at Brighton
(Vie.); he was 12 the day before the concert,
but might easily pass for nine; he has a
face of seraphic fairness, and taken altogether,
looks like embodied music. His father designed
Princes Bridge and other fine structures in and
about Melbourne, so there may be but one brain*
remove between the architect and the musician,
When the boy is not practising Bach’s fugues, he
is snmlintr u. ' „ ’
kt carving huge weapons of

genius doesn’t stop at music—he might just as
easily oe turned out painter or sculptor. His
trainer—Herr Louis Pabst—wants to take him to
Europe, if the money can be got together. The
father of this young musician is, through bad luck
and hard times, at present seeking a living on a
S. Australian station.

Melbournian: “ I was at a full and respectable suburban
concert last night. The 4 National Anthem' was called
for and squeaked by some half-dozen, while the rest con-
temptuously shuffled off with their hats on.”
The difficulty with a Oovernor composing opera-bouffe
is that he has to steer clear of any satire on Royalty, and
that he has to lead the responses in church to the prayer
for the Lords of the Council and all the nobility that they
may bo endued with grace, wisdom and understanding.
Spagnoletti: 44 1 have just had, round my Melbourne
suburb, a boys’ and girls’ variety troupe, the bills appeal-
ing for patronage, on the ground that the show is
44 entirely under juvenile management." There were 21
performers, the girls in a large majority. I sat out the
first part, where the performers looked all under 10.
There were 11 girls in tawdry dresses, and seven boys,
four in black faces. The girls did most of the dancing, the
boys the singing. Without comparing this to an emula-
tion of the thousand page yellow-covered novel of 4 Blue-
skin, or the Knights of the Road,’ one may say it is not
so innocent as the Juvenile Opera Co.”

as that of 44 a rooster stalking through hot mush."
Sydney Telegraph critic thus enthuses about Miss
Henrietta Watson, as the 44 Prodigal Daughter ’’; 44 These
are the heroic, tense occasions in which Miss Watson
excels, for they do not leave unemployed any of her
electric dramatic force, and we have no other actress who
could be so passionate without tearing cats and making
all split.” The idea of the gentle Henrietta tearing oats
is original, anyhow.

The reserved stalls people complain that Nellie Stewart’s

least regard for their opera-glasses. However, if they
must take observations from the front row, why not con-
fine their scientific researches to the chorus tights, and
look at Nellie’s complexion with a naked eye?
A Southern theatrical manager, conspicuous for always
paying salaries, complains that after his people get
about six weeks salary regularly, they grow too big to
“carry their corn,” and become so independent that
they want the pay of an Irving apiece. 44 What do Ido ?”
says he ; 44 1 take to 4 resting ’ for a fortnight, and at the
end of that time I can get 'em all back at my own price
again.”
Minnie Hicks, the victim of the brutal murder at Port
Melbourne, is reported to have been one of the most
accomplished singers and pianistes outside the profession.
In a report of a school entertainment published in the
S.A. Advertiser recently, it was stated that 44 the
dialogue scene between Brutus and Cassius, from Shakes-
peare’s well-known play of the 4 Merchant of Venice ’ ”
was excellently rendered.
Lai Hutton, jmpil of Madame Simonsen, is regarded in
some musical circles as a coming Melba. She is about
16, very beautiful, and her wealthy parents are resolved
to give her all the chances.
Shadow pantomime again. At a select Melb. concert, a
night or two ago, the prima donna so placed her mirror
that all her dressing operations were flashed, in gigantic
shape, on the wall. A semi-reverend gent made a whim-
sical sort of apology to the audience—which didn’t want
any apology, as it enjoyed the situation immensely.
The Melbourne theatrical gala for the starving theatri*
cal charities is tagged all round with morals. Youth is>
more than ever, the sine qua non with a gluttonous
public; the stage is as cruel as the cricket field in this
point. Simply horrible are the sufferings, not only of
hangers-on to the stage in Australia, but of recognised
professionals. And the theatrical gala, at the best, is a
poor measure of relief, considering the mouth of hunger
to be filled. Even the successful veteran surrounds him-
self with young men and women ; there is no place for
the middle-aged, let alone the old. Yet they shoal.
The bifurcated skirt is going to cause trouble. Its
latest victim is a Maryborough (Q.) reporter. Some local
musical amateurs formed an 44 amateur operatic oo.,” and
advertised 44 Maritana," in character. A curly-haired
young lady undertook to personate the pagein bifurcated
skirts. The reporter called them knickers, and said in
print that it ought to draw, hinting that the impending
revelations were beauteous. The lady is adored by a
bank-clerk, who so grievously assaulted the scribe that
the latter is laid up for repairs.
The difference between the 44 King of Crime ” as played
at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), and the same piece in Mel-
bourne is mainly the difference between Albert Marsh
and Charles Holloway. No one can take Bill Holloway’s
brother seriously as the villain ; in fact, it is difficult to
take him very seriously as anything. This is where he
differs from Bill himself, who was always taken seriously,
not to say lugubriously, even in his most festive moments.
Robert Buchanan, the dramatist, is described as “a
big, bald-headed man, with spectacles, who takes himself
tragically.”
Mr. J. P. Macdonald, for many years business-manager
at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), is still, his numerous friends
will regret to learn, very ill, and is an inmate of a private
hospital in Sydney.
Alfred Maltby is returning to Australia as manager of
the London Comedy Co., a joint-stock oonoern, capital
£20,000. He was here some seven years ago, and was
the best feature in a good many of these dreary
mother-in-law- comedies with which Harry St. Maur was
identified. His best character was the fashionable elderly
rake, somewhat inflamed about the nose, very uncertain
on his two wicked old legs, and full of sinful reminiscences
of the ballet, and in this peculiar line of business he had
few superiors.
Essie Jenyns seems disposed to assume the rOIe of fairy
godmother to Hilda Spong.
Gov. Robinson left Melbourne on Friday with his
A.D.0., P. North. This blonde and curly young man has
a voice that should earn him a decent living did Fate oast
his lot in singing places, but when he gives forth his
melody he shows about a square foot of teeth which
remind one of a bull-dog effort to lay hold of something.
Phil Newbury is determined to try his luck against
Belle Cole in M.L. Madame would not concede to Phil
the terms he desired for a tour in the land of his youth,
so ha and his wife have formed a 00. and follow the
distinguished contralto through Maoriland.
At the production of the vice-regal opera, “ Predatoros,”
before the cognoscenti of Melbourne, the guests wondered
mostly why George Musgrove, who occupied a front seat,
made no effort to hide his constant and audible yawns.
George, by the way, was accompanied by his sister on
that auspicious occasion.
Mrs. Besant has changed her plans, and leaves London
for Australia July 27, instead of July 20.
The beautiful contralto, Mrs. Yanderveer Green, erst-
while of Sydney, has obtained great kudos as a show
pupil of Marches! in Paris.
A number of people whose business prosperity some-
what depends on that of Sydney Royal are taking steps
which will much conduce to the success of Mr. Garner’s
coming venture there.
Mr. John Bennett exhibits an interesting relic of the
old Vic. Theatre, Pitt-street, Sydney, being the pay-
sheets for June 12th and 19th, 1847—just 47 years ago.
Amongst the autographs—3l in number—acknowledging
that the “ ghost walked,” are those of J. Gordon Griffiths,
John and Frank Howson, Andrew Torhing, Frank Nesbitt
M'Cron, Madame Oarandini, Mrs. Thompson (mother of
Mrs. Charles Young, afterwards Mrs. Herman Veein). and
Mrs. Guerin. Only two of the 31 now live—Andrew
Torning and Mrs. Guerin, now Mrs. Richard Stewart,
senr., and mother of Mrs. Harwood, Nellie and Maggie
Stewart, and Richard, jun. The pay-sheet does not dis-
close the salaries paid at that time.
Lord Francis Hope Clinton, the young spark who
“ filed ” for £400,000 the other day, is said to have spent
£lO,OOO in bringing MayYohe out as a burlesque star.
He Is also said to have married the damsel, in which
case May wHI naturally feel sorry now that she didn’t
postpone the happy day.
Christie Murray was lately playing a part vice another
man { indisposed, in “A Social Butterfly” at the Opera
Comique. Murray had to act as peacemaker between the
husband and wife of the story, which, considering that
his own wife was suing him for maintenance at the time,
was rather a delicate task for the novelist. But he’s a
born actor, is Christie M. Even his domestic failings
prove that.
Miss Marie Bister (Mrs. Larnach) took her stage-name
from the suburb of Elsternwick, Melb., where she resided
at the date of her debut.
Charles Saunders, the fat and tuneful tenor, was the
only person present at the exhumation of the Needle
bodies, in Melbourne, who had no business to be there.
Queer taste to turn out before 7.30 on a bitter, foggy
morning to see corpses unearthed, Saunders will, no
doubt, soon be singing, with much realism, “Down
among the Dead Men ” and “ The Sexton.”
Charles Turner in his heyday was superb. He always
wanted the nuances of art, but bis vigour was irresistible.
He made much money and spent much, and years of
success left him still at the collar. To his horror, he
grew 'Stout, as tenors will. He never shirked his work,
his voice kept going, going. Now it and he are gone.
The N.S.W. 2nd Infantry Regiment will hold an enter
tainment at Sydney Royal on Thursday, 26th, in aid of
the funds of the recreation-rooms and library. The best
professional dramatic talent locally available has been
secured, and the Sydney Fencing Club is also kind
enough to assist. The dress-circle has already been rushed,
and the trouble will be want of room. “ A Red Rag,”
“Wedlock,” and “A Clerical Error” will form part of
the bill. The object is to furnish what is now a bare room
and get some books and periodicals so that the men may
have a place wherein to meet between parades pleasanter
than a street corner or the usual pub.
“ YOUR LIFE IS NOT WORTH A STRAW.”
Nob worth a straw, eh ? Then it was worth just
nothing—nothing at all. Who has not used that
comparison a thousand times to express absolute
worthlessness? A straw? The wind blows it
away, fire burns it up, cattle tread it in the mud,
it rots by the roadside. What of it? Who cares
for a straw ?
Yet this is exactly what a doctor recently said
to one of his patients, “ Your life is not worth a
straw.” How much is a doctor worth who will
speak so to one that trusts him, and has no hope
bub in his skill? For my part, if he were up for
sale at auction, I would bid one straw tor him—no
more. Even if what he said was true, he had no
right to say it. Such a doctor is more likely to
kill with his tongue than to cure with his drugs.
A woman tells the story, and she tells it well.
If it doesn’t sound like the truth, then I don’t
know what ever does. The dates and the facts
are all there, plain and orderly.
‘‘In the summer of 1878,” she says, “I found
myself feeling tired, languid, low-spirited, and
weak. I felt as if some evil were about to happen.
My appetite was poor, and after eating I had
excruciating pain at my loins and sides. There
was a horrible gnawing pain at the pit of my
stomach, and a rising in the throat as if I should
choke. My head felt as though I had a ton weight
on it. Gradually I got worse, and for months
could take only liquid food. At night I lay awake
for hours altogether.
“Later on I suffered greatly from nervous
prostration. My legs trembled and shook so I
feared to fall. If a knock came to the door I
trembled from head to foot. I had frequent attacks
which began with palpitation of the heart and
sudden stoppage of the breath. At these times I
was speechless and helpless. They say I looked
like a corpse, cold and bloodless, my finger-nails
and lips having turned black. After a while this
would pass off, leaving me weak and prostrate.
I got so emaciated and thin that I was only a bag
of bones, and so weak I had to take hold of the
furniture to steady myself as I crossed the room.
As time went on the nervousness and forebodings
of evil so increased that I feared I should go out
of my mind. The neighbours said it would be a
mercy if the Lord would release me from my
sufferings.
“In this condition I continued for over four
years, during xohich time I consulted jive doctors,
bub nothing they gave me did any good. They all
said my ailment was heart disease, and one said,
* Your life is not worth a straw.'
“ In despair I gave up taking physic, as I felt
that nothing would save me. In May, 1882, ten
years ago, a lady (Mrs. Richardson) called at my
house, told me of Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup,
and strongly advised me to try it. I did so, and
felt somewhat better after the first bottle; and by
the time I had taken three bottles I was completely
cured. From that to this I have had no return of
the attacks, and am so strong I can do any kind
of work. Bub for Seigel’s Syrup I should have
been in ray grave long ago. I wish others to know
this, and will answer any who call or write.”
(Signed) Emma Wiokenden (wife of William
Wickenden, gardener), Pembroke Villas, 123,
Moffat Road, Thornton Heath, March 17th, 1892.
So it turned out that her life was not only worth
a straw, but worth a whole golden harvest of health
and better days. Yet no thanks to the doctors.
Her complicated symptoms puzzled and alarmed
them, to be sure, but why ? Is it not the doctors’
duty to understand such things ? Most assuredly.
Just as a lawyer should know the law, or a pilot
the rooks, tides, and lights of a coast. Had some
of these medical men known that Mrs. Wicken-
den’a malady was indigestion and dyspepsia, and
not heart disease, they might possibly have re-
lieved her. But, confused by the symptoms, they
were blind to the cause. We may well wonder if
there are many such doctors in England.
Cases like this show that the clear sight belonged
to Mother Seigel; and to her remedy hosts of
people in this country are indebted for physical
salvation when, in very truth, their lives seemed
as straws.
Remember, this was ten years ago, and th«
malady has not returned, showing that the cure
was a permanent one.

ON CHOLERA INFANTUM,-Yol. VII.
“Regulation of the diet constitutes, in fact, the

When the mother’s milk is insufficient, Nestle’s
Food is alone to be recommended.” —Pro. Wm. O.
Leube.
On TREATMENT of RACHITIS.-Yol. XVI.
“ In the treatment of rachitis, improper feeding
stands foremost among the causes of those gastro-

venience.”—Prof. Senator.
On SCROFULOSIS.—YoI. XVI,
“What form of artificial feeding ought to be
selected? The results of our own experience may
be briefly stated to be in favour of Nestle’s Food,
the use of which was but rarely attended with
indigestion, while the nutrition of the child im-
proved in the most gratifying manner.”—Prof.

It is lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing Humors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching an»
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour-
ished with pure blood.
CUTICURA
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies, are absolutely pure, and may be used from pimples to scrofula,
from infancy to age, with the most gratifying and unfailing success.

skin purifier and beautifier, externally, instantly allay the most intense itching, burn-

The first type-writer was patented in 1714
by an engineer named Mill, but it was not unto
the last decade that the idea was sufficiently
developed to make it of any practical value. The
necessity of embossing literature for the blind was
the germ of the invention.
A Russian savant has astonished the
scientific world by proving by experiment that
the human body is an electric pile, and that the
skin sends off over the whole surface an endless
number of electric sparks, so small that they can
not be discerned by the naked eye, yet so distinct
in reality that they can be photographed.
A Christian-evidence lecturer, the other
evening, gave an up-to-date discourse, in Christ-
church (M.L.), on “ The Plagues of Egypt.” As
he warmed up to his subject he waxed realistic,
and said that while the plague of boils was afflict-
ing the people, Pharoah “stood up to all his
meals.” But seeing a snigger among the pews he
hastened to explain that the reason he stood up
was that the chairs had all got boils on them.
Dr. Roger S, Chew, of Calcutta, editor of
the Indian Journal of Pharmacy, is the most
systematic leper-curer that The Bulletin has yet
heard from. He publishes a record of 1034 cases
treated, and 422 cured; a cure being effected in
every case (256 in all) in which gynocyanaurizarin
(or C.0.N.) was the agent used. It is worth
noting that Dr. Chew ascribes 148 of his cases
directly to communication of the disease by
vaccination.
The protest by Pastor Miller, of Sydney,
against the action of N.S.W. Parliament in
“omitting to acknowledge God’’at its meetings,
recalls an occasion many years ago in the days when
the President of the Victorian Legislative Council
used to open proceedings with the Lord’s Prayer.
The prayer-book was once mislaid, and the old
gentleman foolhardily started to recite from
memory. He rattled along a bit, and finished it
something like this ; —-“Thy will be dumb; give
us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our
trespasses, as we deliver them from evil. For
Thine is the kingdom, the power of the Tory, for
ever and ever. Amen.” And the fossils present
guessed it was all right, and went on with the
business.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page
19 of this issue.
Mr. Raffles, a very ancient Liverpool
(Eng.) magistrate, died recently, after so many
years’ service on the bench that the date of his
first appearance is forgotten. A long while ago
he. finished his 25th year as stipendiary beak, and
when the court opened on the eventful anniversary
the senior barrister present rose up and made a
few feeling observations on the occasion. Then
the eldest solicitor rose and made a few observa-
tions also ; and the chief constable followed suit;
and after him the principal warder got up and
congratulated his worship warmly. One or two
minor officials ensued- when the warder had
finished. Last of all, just as the court was about
to settle down to business, the prisoner with a
black eye and his ear held together by sticking
plaster, came to the front and began a few well-
chosen remarks, but the court drew the line at
this, and he was rushed into the dock and sent up
for a month.
A recent view of the Transvaal and its
politics :
Johannesburg 1 is a furnace of activity, a perfect pro-
digy. Broken Hill is a mere mining camp compared to
this substa dial town of 50.000 white inhabitants gathered
from every corner of the earth-blacks, Boers, and
British, Levantine and Whitechapel Jews, Yankees and
Russians, French and German, friend and foe —all rush-
ing, gambling drinking together from morning almost to
morning. But the dust ip which one eats, works, and
sleeps is terrible, inconceivable, and, with the rarified air
—the town is about 6000 feet above sea level—makes life
for the first week almost unendurable from chaps and
chilblains. And this staggering city, with its miles of
neat suburbs, ils clubs (social, musical, and racing), its
two beautiful theatres, its magnificently-appointed hotels
that would be a credit to Melbourne, and its shops and
stores fit for Regent-street—all that would be remark-
able in a place of 50 years’ growth—has scarcely
the rights of a municipality, and is practically
disfranchised. For the Boers do not like the English to
put it plainly they hate them—and Johannesburg, which
owes its very existence as anything but a township to
English enterprise, is governed from Pretoria, thepolitical
Capital of the Dutch Republic. This state of things can-
not, it is claimed, continue for very long. When Johan-
nesburg contains as many Englishmen as there are Boers
in all the Transvaal—which will happen soon—it will be
impossible to withhold the franchise, recognised by
Krijgkii as the thin edge of the wedge. The English
annexation of the Transvaal will, we have no doubt, be
brought about, in spite of the assertions of the Boers to
the contrary—but by peaceful means. In Mr. Smvthb’s
opinion Kruger thinks to avert the pressure threaten-
ing from without by the retention of Swaziland
with its 17,000 warriors, but recent cable mes-
sages told us of the outcry raised by that State at the
prospect of annexation by the Dutch, so that Oom Paul
appears to be leaning on„a broken reed. At present
Rhodes does not want this Cinderella of the native States.
Swaziland is of no use to him till he possesses Portuguese
East Africa, which the Cape Government will strive
might and main to acquire, not only because it contains
the port of Mashonaland, Port Beira, but because it
contains the port of the Transvaal, Delagoa Bay, the
finest harbour in South Africa. If the Cape once obtains
the Portuguese colony - and, so far, Rhodes has secured
everything he wanted—Swaziland, with its English sym-
pathies, would be a very easy matter, and then the
Transvaal, completely surrounded by English possessions
and peacefully invaded by English settlers, must become
part and parcel of federated South Africa-the end and
aim of the present policy of Cecil Rhodes.

The real champion mean man ia coming

individual who never bought “ meat,” but always

Poor Lady Henry Somerset! All the spiritual tramps

this good-natured and emotional woman fair game, and
her supposed wealth is being exploited by a host of flat-
terers and schemers, male and female, at a merry rate.
She has been induced to start a newspaper, the Woman’s

“ The corset curse among women is more
insidious than the drink curse among men. Both
sins seek to extenuate themselves on the plea of
moderation. A woman can no more be trusted
with a corset than a drunkard with a glass of
whisky. More barm to the health and vitality
of our race as a whole is done by corsets than by
rum. This article of clothing violates the laws of
good health. It weakens the body, enfeebles the
mind, and dwarfs the soul !” —American paper.
Dear Bulletin, —The best answer to “ J.
Osborne’s” contention that long imprisonment is
no “mercy” as against the gallows is that the
party principally concerned is almost invariably
of a different opinion. The death-punishment—
ceasing with its consummation —lies virtually in
the certain expectation of extinction at a certain
time and in a certain manner. What comes—or
doesn’t come —after is beside the question. It is
the self-preserving part of the animal that suffers —
not the speculative.—A.M.
Dear Bulletin, —That Victorian forensic
notion about a lying witness’s legs is rubbish.
Doubtless a grand essential of good, solid lying is
nerve—to the lack of which mouth and leg-move-
ments may be incidental—but nervous agitation
is as likely as not to proceed from an extreme desire
to be accurate. No rule worth a cent can be
deduced from demeanour. One man can’t assert
that two and two make four without looking like
Ananias; another never looks so veracious as
when he's lying for all he’s worth. The biggest
liar I ever knew couldn’t lie at all unless he looked
you straight in the face.— Whopper.
“ A re-adjustment of the fundamental
principle of the laws of inheritance” is the
panacea of John Downer, Q.C. (S. A.), for curing
the world-wide depression. He argues that what
a man by genius, industry, or' thrift accumulates
during his life should not be interfered with by
the State, but that after his death even absolute
confiscation would be justifiable as no one can
have an inalienable right to property which he
has himself not acquired. “Let a man rob all his
lifetime and only seek restitution after he is
dead?” interjected the Radicals, while the Con-
servatives stared aghast at what they considered
the Anarchism of their putative leader. Downer
has been reading Max Nordau’s “Conventional
Lies of Civilisation.”

Three of the “ unfortunate ” Up South Hebrew
gentlemen, who have “compromised” lately at from Is.
to 2s. 6d. in the £, are now “ prepared to (and do) lend
money to any amount on note of hand alone.” One of
them, whose creditors allowed him (as a matter ot charity)
to retain a few securities considered almost worthless, has
inst realised on one of those securities a reversion of
£18.450, for which he had (prior to his compromise) given
£220. _ # # _ .
Be reversions, —Even the cutest man can be
had. A certain pious man, “who is prepared to grant
monetary assistance to really deserving cases,” was
approached by a meek, heart-broken, Y.M.C.A. youth,
who confided to the pious assister the fact (?) that he had
been led astray and been tempted to borrow a little of his
firm’s cash. The youth, however, had some £14,000
coining to him on his “poor old aunt’s” death, and
wanted to raise £6OO on the reversion to replace the
defalcation. The godly lender, believing that he had the
youth at his mercy, took a pious journey out to a suburb
with the youth, inspected a “poor old aunt” (who looked
80 at least), investigated the will under which the rever-
sion was due, and then—threatened to expose the youth to
his emplovers unless he accepted £415 for the reversion.
The youth reluctantly accepted it, and the lender now
learns that the “ poor old auntie ’’ is only 14 years of age
and that the party he personally inspected is the bor-
rower’s great grandmother. The borrower is at present
in Coolgardie, and the lender wants to hire a lady who is
fond of children on the alleged Needle principle.

When a stockbroker (down South) makes a
time-loan upon mining scrip, he protects himself against
a slump of the security, by getting a written authority to
realise at 24 hours’ notice, directly the value gets below
a 25 per cent, margin on the amount lent. £450 worth of
Westralian scrip was sold on these conditions week before
last, and within 24 hours of the sale the scrip was worth
£2OOO.

An Argus “ correspondent ” addresses Labour-
member Trenwith, suggesting in supposed satire that
there should be a protective tax on sovereigns. The pro-
posal is peculiarly trenchant because we don’t import
sovereigns save when the Argus’ pet banks are more than
usually bung, when the tax really would be useful.
The humorous “ correspondent ” refers to the manu-
facture of sovs. as a “monopoly,” when, as a matter of
fact, the Mints are entirely at the service of anyone who
has gold to coin. The charge in Melbourne for assay,
meltinsr, coining, supervision, and safe-custody amounts
to something less than a halfpenny for each coin, and
this cheapness has been reached, as a matter of cold fact,
under conditions common to all state-fostered industries.
The Australian coining industry is subsidised
by a permanent appropriation of £15,000 in Sydney and
£20,000 in Melbourne, and the local coinage is second to
none in the world. There are revenues to be set off
against aforesaid appropriations, but deficits have existed
all along. In Sydney Mint there is a preferential charge
against the local producer. The “foreigner,” be he
Bananalander or Chinaman, has to pay Id. per oz. less
than the local man. The Argus funny man might venti-
late the Sydney charges with advantage. In Sydney, a
deposit of 500 oz. would be charged at 6d. per oz. or £l2
10a. in all (£lO Ba. if foreign), while the same deposit in
Melbourne would be charged £4 3s. 4d., or if it were good
gold even £3 9s. 6d.

The astute Maoriland syndicate that for many
years persistently and at last successfully backed up the
lesral claims of a "well-known Samoan trader and a native
woman against a big Maoriland-Sydney-cwm-London firm
for uii lawful trespass and seizure of a large estate in Samoa,
is now by no means overjoyed that it ever took a
hand in the game. The case was a famous one, and was
carried from the consular courts in Samoa to Fiji and
thence to Auckland. Sometimes the trader would win,
and then the other side would appeal and a fresh hearing
would reverse the last decision. Finally the English
courts awarded the trader {i.e., the syndicate that ran
him) £BOOO and the land, and forthwith he hurried
back to the land of gin and severed heads and—well, now
he preserves an ominous silence and wears a cold look in
his eye when his supporters seek to know the date on
which he means to fully and finally express his gratitude
in dollars.

Some years ago a syndicate started a “ town ”
near the mouth of a Central Queensland river. The
scheme was splendidly advertised by flaring posters
throughout the length and breadth of Southern Queens-
land. Among other things the syndicate generously gave
half an acre in the centre of the township to each of the
religious denominations. A Wesleyan parson, fresh from
the old country, equipped with a tape-line, proceeded to
the spot to examine the estate which had fallen to his
church. The land was there—undeniably there (as the
worthy man ascertained by means of a boat and sounding-
line) —and had been there under some 4ft. of primeval
swamp-water ever since the days of the plesiosaurus.

After many delays and postponements, says the

MacArthur-Forrest patents is at last to be brought to test
In the High Court of the South African Republic, in
which the African Gold Recovery Co. has begun suit
against Luce and Thompson, who have been applying the
cyanide process at some of the Transvaal mines without
license from the co. The suit is for an injunction and
the recovery of damages, which will bring the matter to
a direct issue. The suit will be watched with much in*
terest; not only by the South African gold mining com-
panies, but by many abroad. The evidence adduced at
Pretoria would be a valuable indication of the probable
result of suits brought elsewhere. Maoriland and Queens-

this affair.

Dear Bulletin, —lie “Megass’s” letter. The
hitch in the Sugar Guarantee Act in S.Q. is the strenuous
opposition of already established mills who see in the
establishment of Sugar Guarantee Mills a certain rise in
the price of cane. Threadbare arguments against Govt,
aiding farmers at 5 percent, to compete with capitalists
at 8 per cent, have formed the key-note of the furious
discussion lately raging through S. Queensland on the
subject. The fact is S.Q. mills will be the test of the
value of cane, and those millers who are giving anything
less than the real value, recognising the fact that S.Q.
mills will be established in spite of opposition, are
hedging as far as possible by making long agreements—
in some cases 21 years, I believe-with those who are na-
able to hold out till the arrival of the Central Mill.

A Ballarat branch of the A.N. A. bewailst a rash
investment of funds. In 1891 it lent £l5OO on • P
perties then valued at £2300. No interest has been paid

that it would not realise the full amount due if sold

bringing a solemn public assurance that bottom naa

A British judge lately decided that, so long as a
company pays its creditors and is an apparently flourishing
concern, there is no reason why it should not go on and
divide profits, though every shilling of capital be lost.
That is to say, the co. is not obliged to make any allow-
ance for depreciation in the value of capital property, but
may go on paying away the business profits until there is
no property left to produce them. The Judge, however,
didn’t sanction the dissipation of depositors money in
bogus dividends to shareholders. There was no question
of deposits in the case, so the judgment has no bearing
upon any of the unpunished Melbourne swindles.

In its eager advocacy of silver-minting for
Victoria the Agb makes the mistake that there is a
dearth of silver coin in Victoria, the tact being that both
the Bank ot Australasia and the London Bank usually
have an over-plus of the stuff. This local coinage of
silver discussion constantly overlooks the fact that the
Mint Charters actually confer the right to coin silver, and
that boldness is all that is necessary to prevent Hingland
continuing its tax on our domestic currency. There is a
present contraction in our currency needs, but that ought
not to blind our precious statesmen’s eyes to the future.

Milk sold to Sydney consumers at 4d. per quart
has, in some cases, been previously sold by farmers and

A N.Q. mining newspaper, which, like the
Barrier press, views with disapproval the pilgrimage of

itself to the statement that “ the reports ‘ f the auriferous

particular, have been much exaggerated.” Then they
found the Londonderry. However, Weslralia has so far
given but a very moderate amount of gold per miner.

When will colonials, and those who affect their
patronage, cease to make themselves appear ridiculous to
the British public ? None are so importunate for adequate
protection ot the Empire, none so noisily loyal, none so
abjectly obsequious to the Court circle, none so gretd.v
of “Queen’s honours,” and none so mean when the
question comes up of who is to pay the piper? I never

merchants who represent Colonial society in London.

world artificialities.

There are some “swagger” lignites in
India ; natives who affix B. A. to their names with
a perfect right to the degree. Their fellow-
students who obtain not the degree still consider
themselves entitled to a high position in the educa-
tional scale, and call themselves “failed B.A.’s,”
in many instances attaching to their signatures
the mystic letters F.B. A. One F.B. A. was lately
writing an essay on the horse. “The horse,” he
observed, “is a noble animal, but when excited
he will not do so.” Probably not. Another
F.B. A. in charge of a traveller’s bungalow, and
evidently desirous of conversation, was questioned
by an English traveller as to the residents in the
neighbourhood of the bungalow. E.T.: “Are
there many residents in this neighbourhood ?’’
F.B.A. : “They are not numerous, sir. The chief
is an old Zemindar, seventy-two years,” E.T. :
“Indeed; is he married?” F.8.A.: “Yes, sir.
He entered the bonds of matrimony the other day,
taking to himself a wife but twenty-four years
old.” E.T. : “Ah! Any children ?” F.B. A. :
“ Yes, sir. There have been two issues—male and
female, which, I consider, speaks well for his
adamantine constitution.”

J . Bull to the Matabele.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Confound your understanding ! Will you never
comprehend
That your country in demanding we but seek you
to befriend !
If your freedom being stifled makes the greeting
rather gruff,
If your treasures being rifled makes the intro-
duction rough,
Still it’s all for your salvation and the glory of the
Lord !
For your soul’s emancipation and the spreading of
the Word !
And, although this insurrection made our indig-
nation hot,
Yet we’ll give you our protection if you’ll give us—
all you’ve got.
If our bayonets are ruddy, if we argue with the
sword.
If the baptism be bloody, blame it not upon the
Lord !
For He viewed with deep dejection from His peace-
ful throne above.
Your obstinate rejection of His messengers of
Love !
So He sent His Anglo-Saxons, His chosen ones, to
spread
His pure and holy maxims (using maxims that
are red),
But the Lamb has shed the shaggy skin he wore
above the fleece
And invites you now to worship him—the God of
Love and Peace !
Then adore ye Christ, the Saviour, fill your
bosoms with His grace !
In the past, for your behaviour, ye have fled
before His face;
Now you’ll understand His preaching, and the love
He bears for you !
(Maybe we’re rough in teaching, and, perhaps,
unchristian, too)
And if we smite you on the cheek, then turn to us
the other
(Though we, perhaps, don’t act as meek and gentle
as a brother),
So ye your savage bosoms fill with peaceful,
Christian Law,
And we—well! we’ll be pious (till it’s time to kill
some more).
The Matabeles hearkened, and the Matabeles
wept,
Their countenances darkened, while the dead
around them slept;
And sullenly they listened to those canting modern
Huns,
While their children they were christened ’neath
the shadow of the guns ;
They were filled with troubled feeling, though
their hearts were free from guile;
They suspected double dealing, they observed the
evil smile;
And silently they pondered on the things that
they had seen;
Did these buccaneers, they wondered, represent
the Nazarene ?
THE WOMBAT.
An Idyl of Nurra Mavra.
THE PARSON’S ELDEST SON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The name of the eldest son of the parson
was Benjamin. Fate’s irony had named him so.
He was the eldest, and was always helped last—
and least. So he was a pessimist. He was 12
years old.
Every year the parson’s salary grew smaller.
Five years back such a thing would have seemed
impossible to the parson’s wife. “It couldn't
get smaller,” she would have said. But it did.
And now she asked her husband, “ Which wilj
you have, jam or butter?” And the parson’s
children were not even asked whether they would
have anything but dripping.
“ It will be * Which will you have, tea or sugar ?’
next,” said Benjamin bitterly, as he chased the
hungry cow out of the front garden into the back
paddock. Then he noticed that the calf was
frisking on the verandah, chewing and licking
away at some white matter. “Shoo!” he cried.
But when he found that it was the fat black book
of hymns, ancient and modern, that it was making
hay of, he stayed his voice and stood dumbly still
and watched. After it had torn out all the leaves
and licked them, and tossed them all over the
verandah, and chewed the cover to a mass of
pulp, Benjamin smi'ed less bitterly and went
away. They always sang out of that book at
family prayers.
Benjamin was not a bad boy. He was only a
hungry one. The world’s well-fed will confound
the two. So the world’s ill-fed are beginning to
make the same mistake about the well-fed.
His one delight was to pick up the tin-tags of
tobacco that smokers dropped in High-street and
imagine they were threepences. He would go
with them and stand before the windows of
Bellamy, the baker. “Now what’ll I buy?” he
would say. “ Two tarts and a bun ? Or a cake
of hokey-pokey, a pennorth of ginger-biscuits and
a cheese-cake ? ” That seemed a good investment.
He imagined these in his mouth. But the tin-tag
was only a tin-tag, after all. Three minutes was
the length of the dream.
One morning the parson came down to breakfast
with a long face, and Benjamin noticed a strange
woman going familiarly about the house.
“ There’s a new little brother for you up-stairs,
children,” said the parson. “He came in the
night.” He tried to look glad.
Four of the children were smitten dumb with
delight. Two ecstatically said, “Oh, Daddy!”
and one laughed aloud with joy. But Benjamin
stood up in his place and burst into wild crying.
“ When it gets a helping there won’t be anything
for me to eat,” he cried, and rushed away from the
room.
Out in the paddocks there ran a little brown
creek with bull-frogs and tadpoles, and many
strange delights in it. Benjamin ran on till he
found himself looking down into its depths.
“What’s the good of living?” he cried. “I
wisht I was dead. If I jumped in ’ere then
they’d be sorry. I just will. I’ve a good mind
to.”
The cow roamed past him, and switched him
with its tail. “Oh,” he said, and gave a great
start, “I was nearly in that time.” Then he
hurried away as quickly as he had come.
The public-school was at the far end of Nurra
Murra, half-a-mile from the parsonage. Benjamin
was walking fiercely school-wards with red eyes,
and a hungry feeling within him, when he noticed
a fat man passing him on the other side of the
road.
. “Now, he's had a good breakfast,” said Ben-
jamin, enviously, “ I know he stuffs. I know
he’s never hungry.” He tried to imagine what he
might have had for breakfast. “Tarts, apples,
bread jam and cream, fried kidneys and
cocoa. ” Really there was nothing that man might
not have had. Oh, the world was a hard place !
Suddenly Benjamin was filled with unreasoning
anger. He looked and scowled. Then he called,
loudly, “Oh, you fat pig !”
• * •
Next day Benjamin saw the fat man again.
Whether he fancied it or not, he certainly thought
the man looked bigger.
“Oh, the stuffing he’s been having !” he said.
He kicked his copper-toes angrily against the
posts of the baker’s shop, and made such a noise
that the fat man noticed him.'
“You greedy gormandizer!” said Benjamin.
But the fat man didn’t hear.
After that the two used to pass each other every
morning in High-street. And every morning
Benjamin had a new epithet for the other. Some
of the epithets were not at all nice ones. But
then, you see, they came from a boy who had had
bread and dripping for breakfast, and would have
bread and dripping again for tea.
One morning it was “ You gorging guzzler,”
and one morning it was “You greedy hippopot-
amus,” and one morning the words his father had
read at prayers were in his head, and it was
You stalled ox!”
One morning the fat man was not there. Ben-
jamin had grown so used to seeing him, that he
wondered. He even propounded theories. The
most feasible one was that someone had had a
birthday, and had asked the fat man to it, and
to-day was the day after.
It was about three nights afterwards that he
heard his father talking to his mother in the
study.
“Most pitiful !” said the parson.
“Ah, the poor fellow!” said his wife. There
were tears in her voice.
“He had eaten nothing for two days,” said the
parson, “He has simply starved to death. He is
dying now, and I must go to him.”
“Take Benjamin with you,” said the mother.
“ The lantern’s broken, and he’ll be company for
you. He can stay outside.”
So Benjamin was called, and was soon walking
away through Nurra Murra with his hand in his
father’s. They went right through the township,
past the church, the bank, the stores, the public-
school, till they came to a cottage standing alone
in a paddock.
“Stay here,” said the parson, “and wait for
me. I won’t be very long.”
Benjamin sat down on the edge of the verandah
and looked up into the sky. What a lot of stars
there were. There was the Southern Cross.
There were the two dogs. There were the five
sisters. What a lot of milk the milkmaid had
dropped to-night. Let’s see, where was the giant?
Ah, there he was. I wonder was he as big as the
fat man. The fat man, why he hadn’t met him
for three days now. The very thought made him
hungry. He jumped up, and went towards the
door of the cottage.
He had been told to wait, and he had waited.
Ho thought he would just look in and try and
catch his father’s eye, and remind him that he,
Benjamin, had been waiting a long time.
He opened the door and went in. He went
down the narrow hall; there was a light in a
mi° m k° the left. He crept softly towards it.
ihe door was just ajar. He pushed it gently.
He saw three people in the room.
One was his father, and one was the doctor’s
sister, and one lay silent on the bed. And even
as Benjamin looked in, the doctor’s sister stooped
and closed the eyes of the silent figure.
“ He is dead,” she said.
it t 't' s the fat man !” cried a little voice.
Is he dead ? Is he really dead ?”
??r»u arne ' n before they could stop him.
~ Oh, daddy, he said, “ what’s the matter with
him ? What did he die of ?”
He starved,” said the parson. “He has been
starving for days, and nobody knew it. Come
away, come away.”
Out in the night, with the red dust underfoot
and the milkmaid overhead, Benjamin cried piti-
fully.
« t J^ alled him a greedy gormandizer,” he said.
I didn’t know. What made him so fat ? How
did I know !”
“That was the dropsy,” said the parson, sadly,
...... , ut , how was Ito know?” said Benjamin.
“Nobody told me.”
LOUISE M. MACK.
Dagonet suggested a good dramatic
effect that should have been worked into the
marriage of Home Secretary Asquith, in London,
t other day. What the occasion required was an
interesting murderer on the verge of execution, so
that Asquith might present his new-made bride
at the altar, with a reprieve for the felon. Then
the bride, in bridal array, could have driven to
the gaol in a gaudy barouche and handed in the
reprieve to the governor, amidst the cheers of a
mighty multitude.
A humourist has been heard from in Mel-
bourne—or rather he hasn’t been heard from,
' s .^ o °ause of the present aggravation.
This individual stole a large copper from the
private house of a gentleman in the metal trade,
ihe owner informed the police, and the police
informed all the principal dealers—save one—to
be on the look-out if the lost article was offered
for sale. The one dealer whom they forgot to
inform was the bereaved proprietor himself, and
the thief, who probably foresaw this circumstance,
went round to his place of business early in the
morning and sold the goods to the foreman before
the boss arrived. When that person did turn up
and found his lost copper sitting placidly in the
yard awaiting him, his language is said to have
been beyond description.

“The Last of Six”:
Tales of the Austral Tropics.
By ERNEST FAVBNG.
With Prefatory Note by Half Boldretvood.
Opinions of the Press :
“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty w e u .... . AU o
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these" faraway
parts. A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.S.M. Herald, July 8, 1803.
“ No writer has given the world a more "vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of this is that
he has, by many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer.
He, too, possesses great descriptive powers.• Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best work. That tlTey wilt he widely read is certain.”— Sidney Mail, July 8, 1893.
“ They present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures ‘>f
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen in wild plm - *
when human hearts are stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. 1 The Last of Six ’is a terrible
tale of cannibalism, treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr. Favenc makes . f
thrilling interest. ‘ The Haunt of the Jinkarras’ suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some extent, but is itself relieved from (ho
suspicion of imitation by faithful local colour and a grotesquerie of conception, in which Mr. Favenc here and" there approaches Foe. Tins
characteristic is especially noticeable in Spirit Led, which the great American might hai'C written, A Grip of Gold Water’ is, perhaps, the
best tale in a collection that should be widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to (purely Australian literature.”—Daily Telegraph
July 15,1893.
‘“The Last of Six and other stories. By Ernest Favenc. (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co ) This is a collection of short but
graphic sketches by Mr. Favenc, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All fcho stories hero arc good
and we can heartily endorse the recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third of The
Bulletin series of Australian reminiscences.” —Australian Star, July 15,1893.
