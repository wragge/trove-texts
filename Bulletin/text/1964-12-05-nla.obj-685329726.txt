When she floats on water, hugs her doll or bounces a ball, Geon is her playmate. Film made from Geon, in a
wide range of applications, opens up a wonderland to manufacturers of plastic toys. Soft and pliable, it brings
life-like quality to cuddlesome toys. Waterproof and colour-fast, it’s a safety factor in swimming aids, makes any
toy brighter . . . to stay that way. Resistant to wear and tear, it stands up to daily adventures in any Alice’s
or Johnny’s wonderland. In almost any industry, Geon can improve products or help evolve new ones. Have
you a product which we can help you improve or develop?

Why did Hanimex add
that ‘F to Praktica IV?
For Fresnal, firstly.
That’s the name of the optical genius responsible for
the latest modifications to Praktica. The same sort of
genius that has developed German automobiles to their
present stage of perfection. Mr. ‘F’ has invented a
new kind of grooved screen view-finder. When you use
it, you’ll see how it concentrates all of the available
light to give a much brighter, sharper picture.
We could have called it a IVFF, actually, because we’ve
also added a new fingertip controlled split-image
range-finder.
This gives the Praktica IVF two new features:
(1) Fresnal screen view-finder.
(2) Fingertip controlled split-image range-finder.
Add these to the excellence of the Praktica IV and to
its fully automatic lenses, its most flexible range of
accessories, its fantastic Hanimex world-wide warranty,
and the finest of service . . . and this justly famous
35 mm. camera is worth more than an initial ‘F.’
The Praktica is a single lens reflex camera with fully
interchangeable lenses. Praktica offers these features
at only a little more cost than simple range-finder
cameras.
Here are the three models:
Praktica IVF with Meyer Domiplan Lens.
This quality f2.8/50 mm. 4-element automatic lens is
hard coated and colour corrected. The automatic dia-
phragm opens and closes as the shutter is released
and the film transported to the next frame. Price . . .
£39/19/6.
Praktica IVF with Zeiss Tessar Lens.
This famous f2.8/50 mm. lens is fitted with a depth of
field preview button and fully automatic diaphragm.
Price . . . £49/19/6.
Praktica IVF with Zeiss Pancolor Lens.
This 6-element f2/58 mm. lens is the finest of its type
in the world—has every modern optical innovation
incorporated, to give the maximum results under all
light conditions. Price . . . £59/19/6.
Praktica offers you the largest range of interchangeable
lenses and accessories in the world. It’s worth a fast
trip to your friendly photographic dealer, who will tell
you a lot more about Praktica and demonstrate every
outstanding feature.
Or, if you prefer, write Hanimex for free literature.
The highly informative handbook, “Praktica System of
Photography,” is also available from Hanimex dealers
at 39/6.

It’s 15 degrees cooler at number 27
It’s hot again. Hot outside and not much cooler inside.
Except at No 27. Last summer they called the Insulwool
people and had their entire ceiling insulated with
Insulwool. So now they’re 15 0 cooler than the house
next door.
Insulwool stops the heat at the ceiling. A thick
layer of rock fibre traps millions of tiny air pockets.
So the heat is effectively retarded. It means you live in a
better climate all the year round.
Insulwool is spun out of molten rock so it never
deteriorates. Lasts a lifetime. Fire-retarding and damp-
proof. It takes less than a day to condition your home
with Insulwool. No mess, no fuss. For an average
home it can cost as little as £45 to install. (It increases
the value of the home by far more than that.)
Cooler in summer, warmer in winter and in winter
you save up to 40% on fuel bills. No other single thing
can add so much comfort to your home.
So, if you don’t live at No 27, ring Insulwool today
for a free quotation. Or at least fill in the coupon below
and get all the facts.

The difference between modern Australian and American offices
Water Coolers!
American management has found that,
workers feel better, work better and
have higher morale when they replenish
body fluids with cool drinking water.
These are facts often stated by medical
authorities.
If you have an eye for increased em-
ployee efficiency and better employee
morale, it is to your benefit to instal a
water cooler or water coolers.
Investigate Temprite water coolers
first. There are 5 good reasons:
1. Temprite water coolers can be bought
(or rented, if you do not wish to make a
capital investment).
2. Temprite water coolers can serve from
10 to 220 employees efficiently, effect-
ively and economically.
3. There are Temprite coolers designed
for every office and plant . . . small or
large. Some models take only 1 square
foot of space. Every model can be
placed near the work area.
4. There is a five year warranty on each
Temprite.
5. Temprite is manufactured in Australia
by Kelvinator, a national name in indus-
trial refrigeration.
Ring Kelvinator for further information
or send for a free brochure.

Few people, even those who have experienced the clarity
and excitement of speaking to someone on the other side of
the world, appreciate the complexities involved in our new
communications system. To take but one example equipment
and highly trained men in OTC’s Paddington terminal are
able to select any submerged amplifier in the COMPAC
cable system and test its performance. These amplifiers lying
at 26 mile intervals in ocean depths to 3,500 fathoms are
dramatically important. They are responsible for boosting
signal levels lost by distance. Before they are used they are
tested for a whole year. All their components are hand made.
All their metal surfaces are goldplated to prevent corrosion or
other defects. And each amplifier is built to contain
duplicate systems working in parallel so that if
one half should fail, the other will
maintain service with negligible effect upon the performance
of the system. That is why OTC constantly check COMPAC’s
underwater amplifiers and maintain the same exacting watch
on the equipment that provides overseas telephone, tele-
printer, telex and leased channel services. And as at
Paddington in Sydney, so at OTC’s international radio
transmitting and receiving stations in other states; in
coastal radio stations around the Australian coastline and
in Papua and New Guinea; at telegraph cable stations as
far away as the Cocos Islands, the OTC is constantly
ensuring that all sections of the Australian community enjoy
the best possible communications with the
rest of the world at the lowest possible cost.

Handmade for you
by Rover.
Much of Rover is hand-finished.
Luxurious? Yes. Extravagant? No.
For one simple reason. It lasts longer
and looks better than anything mass-
produced. Owning a Rover has many
more pleasures and advantages. Here
are just a few.
1. Rover’s attention to finish is a
matter of record. The paintwork, for
instance, is sprayed with five hand-
rubbed coats of special enamel.
Hand-polished African cherry is in-
laid on fascia and window trims.
The simple classic lines change very
little from year to year. (An inter-
national gold medal has been awarded
for coachwork.)
2. Rover is a very lively machine.
Driving in city traffic is deceptively
smooth and docile. But Rover has
great reserves of power. Top speed
is more than 100 m.p.h. The three
litre motor develops 129 horsepower
- —you cruise at 80 all day. Over-
drive is standard equipment. You
may choose between a fully auto-
matic transmission or a more sport-
ing four-speed synchromesh hand-
shift.
3. Rover is also a very safe car. Big
servo-assisted disc and shoe brakes
need only a touch to dissolve even
the highest speeds. Safety padding,
windscreen washers and tamper-
proof locks all add to your feeling
of well-being. Vision is excellent. A
superbly engineered suspension gives
you the kind of smooth road-holding
and handling you’d expect from the
men who designed and produced the
gas-turbine cars.
4. Rover is exceedingly comfortable.
The lack of fatigue over long dis-
tances is quite remarkable. You
relax in fully adjustable seats deeply
upholstered in hides of the finest
English leather. The spaciousness,
thick pile carpeting and luxury
appointments add to your comfort
and pleasure. Door arm rests also
adjust to suit your fancy. Noise and
vibration rarely intrude even at high
speeds.
5. An air of quiet luxury is to be
found throughout the entire car.
Heating and demisting equipment is
built-in. You’ll also find a courtesy
light above each door. Two-level
ventilation for each person. There’s
even a hidden nest of tools. A re-
serve fuel supply. And a switch to
tell you the oil level in the motor.
The silence is supreme, even at high
speeds. Sound absorbing underlays,
rubber body mounts, and thick
underbody sealing keep out dust and
extraneous noise.
6. Parts and service are not expen-
sive. A network of specially chosen
dealers will do everything to keep
you happy with your Rover long
after you've bought it. Rover has
earned a reputation for being one of
the best engineered motor cars in the
world. It is designed to be driven
and enjoyed long after many ordinary
cars have been discarded. Your in-
vestment will in fact cost less to
maintain than most others, regardless
of price.
There are many more exciting aspects
to this fine car. If you would like
the pleasant experience of discover-
ing them for yourself, please write or
call We’ll send a Rover to your
door.

Safety!
“Lubeless” cars and “changeless”
oils ... a promise of more
carefree motoring? But road
safety authorities warn of
the attendant dangers.
I
55
V
How necessary is that regular lube? Let’s
look at the facts.
First, lubrication itself may take only a
fraction of the time your car spends in the
bay. Far more important is that devoted to
checking normally-hidden trouble spots in
linkages, braking systems, tyres, etc.
At Caltex stations, numerous checks are
carried out in the routine of a 1,000 mile
Marfak Service. Result—incipient faults can
be spotted while correction is still a matter
of minor adjustment.
Extend the interval, and you multiply
five or six times the chance of a slight fault
growing into a major repair job. At best,
your “saving” on the services you cut may
turn out a very false economy. And if a
sudden driving emergency, not a service
mechanic, shows up an unsuspected defect
. . . the results may be all too tragic.
In fact, recent road figures show a
disturbing upsurge of accidents due to
mechanical failures. An acknowledged
expert and Road Safety Councillor said
recently that regular safety inspections were
needed to see that wheel bearings, springs,
brakes, universals, shackles and tyres were
in safe condition. Any faults in these could
be spotted —on the lubrication hoist.
The second fact is simply that few Aus-
tralian drivers have a real choice. Experts
warn of serious effects when the oil change
interval is extended for “older” engines. And
only some cars have the special provision
that makes extended lubrication intervals
permissible (though they can be shortened
without adverse effect). For most of us,
1,000 miles maximum is the maker’s
instruction.
These are the facts. The hoist awaits.
The decision is yours.

National Notebook
Great-Granddaughter
TMTiss Monica Dickens was rubbing
W A her one pair of hands with delight
after a particularly successful session,
'signing copies of her latest novel, “Kate
i and Emma,” in the book department of
Farmer’s.
“We sold more than 200 copies in the
lunch-hour,” she said, “and all, I should
think, to people who had come into the
, shop to buy something else. They
couldn’t get past me. I was right in the
middle of the aisle. There were ampli-
fiers going the whole time, telling shop-
pers I was there. The voice started off
| saying I was Charles Dickens’ great-
granddaughter and ‘one of England’s
(most popular writers’, but in the end I
think I had become Charles Dickens’
daughter and ‘England’s greatest author’,
but it was wonderful. I did this for a
whole chain of book-shops in England
fonce and almost nobody came. Generally
‘they say to you, ‘You should have been
[here last week when So-and-so was sign-
ing copies. He sold hundreds’.”
I As well as personally disposing of
Copies of her book for her new publishers,
\Heinemann, Miss Dickens gathered up a
rich sample of Australian speech. “Most
of the people who want you to sign their
copy expect you to dedicate it. This
woman said to me ‘Emma Chisett’, so I
pvrote ‘To Emma Chisett with best wishes
[irom Monica Dickens’, when I discovered
lihat she was saying ‘How much is it?’ ”
j “I find that in Australia books are
bought by a much wider class of people
than in England,” she said. “Here people
sbn't seem to be frightened of them. In
England books still are bought mostly by
jiddle-aged middle-class women, al-
though paperbacks are breaking down
(resistance and getting people used to
hooks. Here, too, I have met the sort
of loyal reader that I don't meet any-
where else, like the woman whose grand-
daughter was called Monica after me.”
’Miss Dickens, who now lives in the
United States, admitted that she had very
(little following there. “My books are too
(English,” she said, “and besides, Ameri-
can publishers are not interested in the
'f>rt of author who can sell a steady
|12,000 copies. They want big best-sellers
everyone will buy and no one will
re ad. And they prefer books by Ameri-
cas. They think Morris West is an
American,” she told the Heinmann repre-
sentative in an aside.
I “But my next book will be the first
“ Eave set in America. I think I under-
Pnd them well enough to try to do this
>w. However, I have a good, strong
;i lot to keep it going. It’s a thriller with
a ghastly old woman as the central
character, a real Bette Davis role. Per-
haps it will be my first American best-
seller and my first book to be made into
a film. Then, of course, I’ll never write
another book.”
Perth Festival
of the events of the 1965 Perth
Festival will be the £5OO Wardle
award for contemporary Australian
painting. The competition is by invita-
tion and entries will be shown in the
Skinner galleries from February 2 to 13.
Art critic of the London “Sunday Times”,
John Russell, will be judge. Afterwards
Russell will visit the eastern States. After
having seen a fair sample of Australian
art within Australia, he should be in a
much better position to estimate it than
those experts who only Nolan know.
Asian Highway
HPhe Asian Broadcasting Union con-
ference, recently held in Sydney,
called for joint efforts between member
nations. The ABC is rather proud of
having jumped the gun on this. A docu-
mentary to be shown this month is the
result of collaboration between Japanese
and Australian teams.
Earlier this year two ABC men, news-
reel supervisor Ivan Chapman and radio
man Peter Barnett joined three sound
"I wasn't always like this."
and cameramen from Japan’s NHK in
Barsagan, on the Turkish-Iranian border.
The team travelled along a major part
of the UN’s 6,500-mile Asian Highway
Project stretching from Europe across
seven countries to Saigon.
Ivan Chapman showed us a map of
the road that snakes through high moun-
tainous regions “we were nearly
blown off the road by blizzards here”
across barren deserts “the mer-
cury jumped to 125°” through towns
and passes rich with history. This is
highway “A-l”, now 97 per cent com-
plete. When finally opened in 1967
motorists will be able to drive from the
English Channel to the Pacific on good
roads all the way.
“We’ve used the road as a recurring
theme in the two one-hour features we
will show,” Chapman said. The magni-
tude of this UN project can be imagined
when we consider that it will affect the
lives of 600 million people one fifth
of the world’s population.
“What stuck in my mind is how much
the road means to them. It isn't only
an economic asset. The road opens up
highways for pilgrims to many of the
sacred Moslem shrines. It also means that
these people will be visited by tourists,
with resultant effects on their local
economy. In almost every village I was
buttonholed by someone often un-
shaven and not particularly prepossessing
who introduced himself as the local
correspondent for a paper. He wanted a
story and the interest we and the rest
of the world were taking made big news
to him.”
Resourcefulness
nPHESE are the dying days of the pre-
sent NSW State Parliament, and
something the Labor Government would
probably like to see die with it is the
report of the Youth Advisory Committee.
The committee met for 11 months in
1961 and saw 147 people from 19 coun-
tries. As long as the committee was
meeting, the Government could meet
criticism by saying: “But we are tack-
ling the problem of juvenile delinquency.
We’ve got a committee.”
The committee's chief recommenda-
tions were the setting up of a full-time
youth commission and the establishment
of a youth leadership training college.
These were estimated to cost something
short of £1,000,000 in the first three
years. The Government said it didn't
have that sort of money. Recently the
Minister for Education, Mr Wetherell,
put forward a scheme for an evening
course in youth leadership, which, Judge

See mile after mile of brown, flat plains . . . silent, empty
aeres ... a lonely monotony of sparse, winter grasses with
spindly box and boree lining ancient dry creek beds. Then,
see these same acres two years later, a colourful patchwork of
flourishing fruit, rice, cotton and green pastures, and you see
a miracle . . . the almost unbelievable miracle that water brings
to a continent known as the driest on earth.
Such a place is the new Coleambally Irrigation Area, stretching
across the land like some gigantic real estate project with
roads, bridges, canals and a contoured pattern of farmlands
destined to be Australia’s largest irrigation area and planned
on the additional bounty of water from the “Snowy” Scheme.
Spectacular, bustling Coleambally is an area of 1 million acres
the M urrumbidgee Irrigation Area in Southern
JN.S.W. New farmers, including ex-clerks, builders and trades-
men, mingle with neighbouring farmers in the Murrum-
bidgee Irrigation Area in a common bond of progress and
achievement.
In tune with the tempo of the area, is the success of two
relatively new crops to Australia—rice and cotton. The 1964
rice crop from the M.1.A., Coleambally, and other Riverina
areas is a record 139,000 tons from 58,000 acres and worth
£l5 million. Coleambally contributed 25,000 tons, equivalent to
the total rice harvest in Australia a few years ago. Already
Australia is exporting more than two-thirds of its crop.
The introduction of cotton in 1963 as an alternative crop to
rice in these areas has added a new zest to rapid expansion.
Australia imports £7 million of cotton lint, and a further £3O
to £4O million in cotton piece good„<i To grow sufficient cotton

for present requirements would occupy about 100,000 acres.
Until 1963 cotton was mainly confined to Queensland. Since
then irrigated cotton has also been established at Wee Waa in
N.S.W., and the Ord River in W.A. In N.S.W. acreage has
leapt from 59 acres in 1959 to 10,000 acres in 1963. This is
expected to reach 25,000 acres in 1965 and perhaps 50,000
acres in 1966.
Mr. E. R. Hoare, of the C.5.1.R.0. Irrigation Research
Laboratories at Griffith, N.S.W., has stated that “it has now
been firmly established that future developments in cotton will
occur only where there is adequate irrigation.”
Thus, a new chapter is unfolding in the brilliant saga of water '
development in Australia and the benefit it brings to the nation. ,

Curlewis estimates, would cost the Gov-
ernment a modest £350.
Judge Curlewis, who was president of
the Youth Advisory Committee, objected
strongly to this course. “We don’t mind
how small the step towards a youth
leadership training college,” he told
| The Bulletin, “so long as it is in the
fright direction.”
But the whole idea of youth training
is to develop resourcefulness and enter-
prise, and Judge Curlewis and his associ-
ates are now trying to show- they have
these qualities. Judge Curlewis, as NSW
chairman of the National Fitness Council,
went to the Council’s Commonwealth
body. As a result a youth leadership
course will begin at the National Fitness
Camp, Narrabeen, in March. The course,
(which will be advertised within the next
few days, will take 90 students from all
parts of Australia, and diplomas will be
awarded. The initial course at Narrabeen
f is for only four weeks, but further work
is required, including 432 hours of prac-
tical work.
Judge Curlewis sees no difficulty in
I placing people who do undertake the
course. At the moment, he said, Kurin-
bai Council has set aside £2500 a year
(for a youth leader, but there isn’t anyone
brained to take the job. Other councils
[had shown interest.
| The trained youth leader is not a very
clear concept to many people and this
fjnay be one reason why the report was
so easily shelved. Perhaps most people
think of Nazi youth organisation, or a
superannuated Boy Scout with badges on
this sleeves and scabs on his kness.
'j The professional youth leader Judge
jCurlewis has in mind is someone who will
take the job on as a life's work and who
would have much the same point of
view as a specialist in child welfare, mar-
riage guidance, vocational guidance or
'any social work.
“We want to get away from the well-
intentioned amateur,” Judge Curlewis
said, “We want someone who can direct
the quiet child to stamp-collecting as well
aj getting the lively child on to the sports
field. But without leadership, the limit of
npost groups’ ability to organise is the
barbecue.”

\New Zealand Import
Cydney has just seen its first exhibition
' of New Zealand art since before
the war. These are the paintings of
Robert Ellis which were shown at the
Komon Galleries. Ellis is New Zealand
only by adoption. He was born in
England.
Ellis explained that most of New
Zealand’s modern painters were concen-
trated in Auckland, where there are four
galleries. The rest of the country
was still held by geyser-painters.
“Even in Auckland not many pictures
ire sold,” he said. “New Zealanders
don’t have their tastes directed for them
as Sydney people do. Consequently they
are often afraid to buy work, the value
of which they can’t assess. Things are
looking up, but generally speaking
artists are oddities. That’s the first thing
I noticed when I came to Sydney. An
artist isn’t suspect.
“Of course, Australia doesn’t make it
too easy. Yours is one of the few
countries in the world that hasn’t ratified
the UNESCO agreement on the importa-
tion of foreign art. New Zealand has.

Man With A Horn
J>erhaps most of the small welcoming
crowd at Mascot were there for
singer Trini Lopez. The young girls
with a pasteboard notice, “Welcome
Trini”, certainly were. But jazzman
Louis (Satchmo) Armstrong wasn’t
worried about opposition. Armstrong,
here on his fourth visit—his third was
his farewell one—had the look of a
man who’d been around for a long while
and might be around for some time still.
He sat, a dissipated-looking golliwog,
and the microphones closed in.
“Retire? . . . Now that’s a dirty word
... I never done it before and I never
seen anyone make a success of it so I
don’t aim to try it . . . You get so tired
sitting around doing nothing ... I got
to take my horn on vacation anyway . . .

as I can blow ... I don’t worry about
what they call the style, rock ’n’ roll,
anything ... If it’s a good number I pay
my 75 cents and buy it . . . No, I don’t
get tired of travelling . . . One place’s

VOLUNTEER SOLDIERS
80 Years Ago, December 13, 1884
Tt is difficult to know to what pre-
cisely to attribute the movement
afoot to form a corps of Volunteer
Cavalry in the city of Sydney. We
cannot regard the proposed troop as
a serious organisation. It is contrary
to commonsense that the city should
furnish cavalry. Artillery and foot-
soldiers are the natural products of a
town population; and of artillery
especially, this colony, and particu-
larly the coast cities and peculiarly
Sydney itself, are seriously deficient.
It is to the inland parts that the
colony must look for its mounted de-
fenders. The Australian settler is
almost invariably a fair horseman—a
better horseman generally than the
class from which the cavalry regi-
ments of England, France and Ger-
many are formed. And the class of
stockmen and young men on stations
are horsemen of the highest grade,
and generally, without being like the
Boers or the Canadian back-woods
men, crack shots, are fairly handy
with firearms. There are thousands
of such men in the country who would
respond with alacrity to a call to
arms, and who in time of war would
be ready at one hour’s notice to pre-
sent themselves with a couple of good
horses, riding one and leading the
other, packed, to receive rifles and
ammunition, and thenceforth to be
ready to make a dash of a couple of
hundred miles in any direction in any
one week.

PLAIN ENGLISH
“The Principles of 1916 ”
Saturday’s Senate election will be a
young voters’ election, not only be-
cause almost half of the electorate is
now under 25 years of age but also
because Mr Arthur Calwell has made
them his special target and claims to
be their -spokesman against the old
men of the Liberal Government. He
ihas also followed up his direct appeals
with a series of TV programmes in
.which younger men and women are
Ithe main spokesmen for the ALP. The
sort of campaign at least recognises
that the young voters are the main un-
known element in the election, since
nothing either party can say now will
persuade the older voters for or against
conscription; they made their minds
up long ago.
But despite the special effort, it
heems probable that this coming
[Saturday will show the ALP to be as
(much out of touch with the younger
[generation on defence policy as recent
'elections have shown it to be on social
policies. It is one thing to emphasise
Ihe importance of the younger voters;
but the emphasis is wasted if no real
effort is made to find out what their at-
titudes are and Mr Calwell is surely
mistaken if he imagines that his urgent
appeals to the great “principles of
j 1916” represent anything more than
[pathetic gibberish to ninety per cent of
them.
The gulf between the generations is
greater in Australia than in most
countries, and it is Labor, with its ap-
peals to the anti-conscription slogans
of the past, that is the real voice of
the past. Electoral field workers, in-
cluding ALP ones, are reporting all
over the country that the only voters
strongly opposing national service are
older people. They are the men and
women who spent their formative years
before World War II when Britain was
a major power; for them it requires a
constant effort of mind to realise that
Australia is no longer for defence pur-
poses an island anchored off the coast
of Europe and protected by the all-
powerful British Navy.
The younger voters have lived
through a radically different era in
which Britain has declined, the United
States has emerged as Australia’s most
powerful ally, and the Asian threat to
Australia, which to many older voters
may still mean Japan, has now taken
on wider dimensions.
It seems most probable the young
voters will vote for selective conscrip-
tion as a commonsense measure to
strengthen the country while a few
of the older people will vote against it.
One may hope that another contemp-
tuous defeat for the ALP would finally
make it realise that its present mixture
of fossilised thinking and Leftist direc-
tion is doomed. But that, too, may be
optimistic. The ALP seems like a
demented man, destined to go on re-
enacting its infantile traumas until it
either dies or receives some new, still
undiscovered, shock treatment.
Lessons from the Congo
the Peking-inspired rebellion in
) the Congo lurches to its horrible
there are several lessons to
be drawn which the world may ignore,
but which Australia, with its responsi-
bilities in New Guinea, dare not. The
; first and most obvious is the dangers
of swift decolonisation. If we, under
'the sort of UN pressures to which Bel-
gium submitted, speedily evacuate
New Guinea before it is capable of
self-government, we can expect the
same sort of tribal wars, break-down
of government, and collapse of the
economy as we have seen in the
Congo. There is no excuse for delay
in building up a native elite, but it
would be criminal negligence to evacu-
ate the country, in the name of deco-
lonisation, before that elite is well
established.
Secondly, we now know how useless
the United Nations can be in such
post-decolonisation situations. When
the rebellions began, the UN crushed
the only well-governed, prosperous
province in the Congo Katanga
produced a state of total confusion
throughout the country, and then left.
For models of how to handle such
situations, one should rather look to
the former French and British colonies:
their governments, faced with rebel-
lions, called in the French and British
armies which suppressed them and
then speedily withdrew. Anything
seems preferable to a UN interference.
Thirdly, it is now clear how idiotic
is the policy of trying to oppose Com-
munism by condemning every native
anti-Communist as a lackey' of the
whites. Along with President Kasavu-
bu, Tshombe has been the only leader
capable of keeping the Congo on a
politically and economically progres-
sive path. But the West drove him out
of the country, and it was only as a
measure of desperation, when the
Communists looked like taking over
the Congo as they have already taken
over Zanzibar, that he was invited to
return and stabilise the country. He
may now succeed. The Communists are
far more aggressive in Asia than they
have been in Africa, and a Congo situ-
ation could easily arise in New Guinea;
there will then be plenty of people in
Australia to call all our New Guinea
friends “stooges”.
Off the Record
'T'he banning of two books by the
Customs Department last week
(Terry Southern’s “Candy” and Jean
Genet’s “Our Lady of the Flowers”)
was, under the present dispensation,
only to be expected. They are
both the sort of book the Department
likes to ban, and although the free
distribution of them would do the
community no harm, they are of no
particular merit either. More import-
ant is the absurdity which Professor R.
Martin draws attention to on page 20.
His University of NSW Library has
been permitted to import £7O worth
of psychology books which the Pro-
fessor of Psychology may only consult
if he promises not to quote them in
any of his lectures, seminars or dis-
cussions with medical, science or psy-
chology students.
Needless to say Professor Martin has
informed the authorities of his Uni-
versity that in the circumstances he
cannot, and will not, use the books.
This is a clear case of Govern-
ment interference in the pursuit of
academic work and the sooner the
Minister for Customs, Senator Ander-
son, puts an end to it the better. This
is the sort of thing his predecessor,
Senator Henty, always tried to pre-
vent.


THIS AUSTRALIA:
A Senate
Election Round-up
L. HAYLEN
J. T. KANE
New South Wales
Otate aid, rather than defence, may be
a decisive issue in the NSW’s Senate
election on Saturday.
A strong section of the Protestant
Churches in NSW has joined a well-
organised campaign to register a protest
vote against the Menzies Government on
State aid. The group is supporting a move
to give Mr Leslie Haylen (Labor) the
number one vote on the NSW Senate
ticket and so prevent the DLP candidate
Mr Jack Kane from being elected. Kane,
State Secretary of the DLP, went close
in 1961 to becoming the Party’s first
NSW candidate to win any election —
State or Federal. In that year DLP
held the number one position on the
ballot paper and Kane lost to Senator
Douglas McClelland by 3412 votes. Had
Kane polled another 1707 votes —half
McClelland’s majority plus one he
would have won the seat.
On those figures the DLP would need
to increase its 1961 vote by one per cent
to receive Liberal preferences and, with
them, win the seat. However, at this
coming election the DLP has not the
advantage of the “donkey vote”, said
to be worth 36,000 votes, but which,
because of fewer candidates and only one
ballot paper, may be worth considerably
more than that. Yet Kane still has a
chance of winning, because whilst Mc-
Clelland belonged to the Left-wing group
he was not nearly as widely known as
a Left-winger as Leslie Haylen.
There is considerable speculation as
to what is going to happen to the
Catholic vote in Saturday’s election. A
“Labor Yes Haylen No” committee
has circularised a pamphlet to the NSW
Catholic clergy drawing their attention to
support for Haylen from the Left-wing
sectarian newspaper “The Rock” which
on November 12 launched a campaign to
draw anti-State aid Liberal voters into
the Haylen camp. Moreover, large
sections of the Right-wing ALP leaders
who applauded Haylen’s defeat in Parkfes,
after 20 years, last November, may not
work for him; on the contrary they are
liable to be working against him. Hay-
len’s supporters are aware of this.
J. A. Mulvihill (ALP candidate) and
Bill Colbourne, secretary of the NSW
branch of the ALP. were in a flat spin
when they heard of “The Rock” article
supporting Haylen. They fear this will
cause large sections of the Roman
Catholic vote to turn away completely
from the Labor ticket.
And since Sir Robert Menzies’ State
Aid proposals of November last year
caused so many former Labor voters to
vote Liberal, they fear this could apply
again. Mulvihill and Colbourne are com-
fited somewhat by having the “donkey
vote” to which the Communist prefer-
ences will be added.
An unsigned letter to the Roman
Catholic clergy from Haylen’s critics
also draws their attention to an article
by the late J. M. Kelleher in the Catholic
Weekly on October 22, 1959, which
concluded with these words: “I personally
do not believe Mr Haylen is a Com-
munist. But no Communist could have
done a better job of Party propaganda.”
James Patrick Ormonde (ALP) is tip-
ped to become the first Australian in
election history to poll a million votes.
In the last Senate poll the top NSW
candidate J. Fitzgerald polled 840,516
votes though his name was opposite on
the 20th square on the papers. Those
840,516 votes were his share of a total
vote of 1,782,732. Ormonde’s two run-
ning mates are Mulvihill and Haylen.
Liberals Sir Alister McMullin and
Kenneth Anderson are certain to retain
their seats while Country Party candi.
date Thomas Bull will fight it out with
Kane and Haylen for the fifth Senate
seat. Kane’s two running mates are Jan
Van Der Rijt and C. C. Mac Naught.
The recently-formed United Liberal
Labor Party contesting the election for
the first time in NSW is headed by R. F.
Sarina, who for many years has stood
as a Labor candidate. With him are
N. A. Ericson and J. H. Wylie. Loss of
their deposits is not unlikely for the
Party will be lucky to poll one per cent
of the votes as will be the case with the
Communist Party candidates (P. M.
Clancy, Barbara Curthoys and L. D,
Kelton) and the sole Independent R. F.
Batley, intriguingly described as a farmer
of Pitt Street, Sydney.
Victoria
Tip to last weekend, the Senate election
in Victoria was as unexciting as a
sacred concert. The Prime Minister, Sirj
Robert Menzies, opened with a quiet i
fatherly talk from a TV studio; Arthur
Calwell, though a Victorian, opened in
Brisbane a thousand miles away, and
was not due in his home State until a
week before polling day; not even the
atomic bomb exploded by the DLP’s
Senator Cole, when at Hawthorn, in the
heart of Jim Cairn's electorate, he advo-
cated Australia’s own nuclear deterrent,
could wake Victoria up. Electoral offi-
cers have commented on the few postal-
vote applications lodged. Apparently elec-
torate workers, who will toil for an indi-
vidual House of Representatives candi-
date, are cold on Senators. One wryly
commented: “Why work for Senators?
We never see them.”
Again there is no Country Party
candidate. By agreement with the Liber-
als, they are allowed one Senate candi-
date every second election, and 1964
was not their turn. C.P. leaders called
for support for the three Liberal Sena-
tors, but the “cockies” were not enthu-
siastic especially in view of the
vendetta in State Parliament between
the Country Party and Liberals.
Sole interest is in who will get the
fifth Senate seat. Senators John Gorton
and Ivy Wedgwood are home and hosed
for the Liberals, and Senators Pat Ken-
nelly and Bert Hendrickson have no wor-
ries for the ALP. Fifth seat will be won
by either Senator George Hannan
(Liberal) or Frank McManus (DLP).
The ALP, despite Arthur Calwell’s
claim of a fifth seat Senate win in every
State, has little hope for its third man,
Wimmera wheat-farmer, Jumbo Sud-
holz. With both DLP and Liberal pre-,
ferences against the ALP, it would need!
50% of the votes to get three seats.]
Six months ago in the State election


the ALP got 36%. ALP preferences go
to the Liberals, Liberal preferences to
the DLP. Therefore, if the ALP polls
higher than the Liberals, McManus will
win on Liberal preferences.
If the Liberals exceed the ALP, Han-
nan will win on Labor preferences
unless the DLP can lift its 15% vote
in the State election to the 161% needed
to win a seat. The DLP is seeking
sympathy votes on the ground that it
polls one in seven in Victoria and holds
not one of the 43 Federal seats. It points
out that Tasmania has fewer than 200,000
voters and has 10 senators. The DLP in
Victoria polls over 200,000 and does not
get a guernsey.
Decisive factor as usual could be bal-
lot paper positions. The ALP drew the
coveted No. 1, worth about 36,000
donkey votes as a start. Its “How-to-
Vote” card is a campaigner’s dream as
it can ask its voters to go right across
the ballot paper, without one variation.
This means few ALP informals and will
boost their vote. They claim they have
a forlorn chance of 50%. The DLP
is mounting the biggest TV campaign.
It claims it has to counteract the much
greater free time given by the ABC to
NANCY BUTTFIELD
C. COURT
G. C. HANNAN
the major parties. It also is throwing
.everything into a personalised campaign
to elect Frank McManus as the Senate’s
proportional representation offers its
only chance of a Canberra seat.
Queensland
Queensland’s current economic and
political climate points at the Liberal-
Country Party and the ALP each win-
ning two of the five Senate seats to be
filled. (The Lib.-CP holds three at pre-
sent and the ALP, two.) This would
mean the return of Senator lan Wood
>(Lib.-CP) and Senator Felix Dittmer
(ALP). It also would mean the election
of Mr I. A. C. Lawrie (Lib.-CP), and
of Mr J. B. Keeffe, the Federal ALP
Secretary. These four are listed one
and two, respectively, on their party
tickets. But what of the fifth seat?
Here lies the uncertainty. And the seat
is vital, because of the Government’s
slender grip on the Senate.
The two candidates, who appear to
have the strongest chances of snatching
this seat are the Liberal-CP No. 3, Mr
R. N. Witham and the Democratic
Labor Party’s No. 1, Mr V. C. (Vince)
Gair. On past voting efforts by Queens-
landers, and taking the economic climate
into consideration, Mr Witham should
get the seat. Born in South Brisbane in
1902, Mr Witham is a man of intellect
and personality. He established a State
record by being re-elected seven times
Mayor of Gympie, a mining centre, in
the Wide Bay-Burnett district, north of
Brisbane. Mr Witham is a former
chemist, who was first in the State in
the dispensing of medicine and botany
in his qualifying examinations in 1922.
He is a foundation member of the Lib-
eral Party, and has said: “I am quite pre-
pared to go anywhere the Party desires.”
The high regard in which he is held
by the upper echelon of the Liberal
Party is undoubted. This was emphasis-
ed on October 5, when he was selected
to displace Senator Roy Kendall as the
Party’s No. 3 Senate candidate. When
this happened, Mr Witham said: “Now I
have a chance to secure my greatest
political ambition.”
His Party platform rests on two up-
rights: promises that he will work for the
establishment of further secondary in-
dustry in Queensland, and also for the
implementation of more water conserva-
tion schemes. (Mr Witham played a big
part in moves behind the building of a
£1,000,000 Nestles powdered milk fac-
tory at Gympie.) These are issues that
will appeal to Queenslanders.
Mr Gair, Premier of Queensland from
1952 to 1957, is a man who is bitterly
disliked by thousands of ALP Queens-
landers yet remembered, fondly, by
many. This election probably will be
recalled as either the triumph, or final
tragedy of Vince Gair. Now 62 years
old, he seems certain not to stand for a
Senate seat again. He missed the fifth
seat in 1961 by 28,272 votes.
Will there be a swing of sufficient mag-
nitude to appoint him this time? Mr
Gair’s chance of being elected will de-
pend on what he is remembered for,
and how much Queenslanders resented
the recent Parliamentary pay grab. He
certainly will stand out starkly in the
memory of those voters over 25. They
will remember how a decision by him
wrecked the Australian Labor Party in
1957. This was when he, as Premier,
refused to obey a QCE direction on three
weeks’ annual leave. Mr Gair said at
the time: “No Government can be
directed by a body outside Parliament on
the timing of legislation,”
Then, he and all his ministers, except
for the Deputy Leader of the Party, Mr
J. E. Duggan (now Opposition Leader of
the Queensland Parliament), walked out
of the ALP, and later formed the
Queensland Labor Party. The QLP then
eventually affiliated with the DLP. For
this action, is Mr Gair recalled by a
majority of Queenslanders as a traitor to
his Party, or a man of great political
courage? What happens on December 5
will answer this question. The DLP has
one early advantage—No. 1 position on
the ballot paper.
The third most prominent candidate
for the fifth Senate seat is Mr George
Irvine Whiteside, a former ALP Senator,
who lost his seat to Senator Ken Morris,
the former deputy leader of the Lib.-
CP, in November last year. And he
only lost the seat after a breathtaking
struggle. Mr Whiteside led by 17,000
votes at one stage, but lost by 9095.
Yet there are few factors which suggest
that Mr Whiteside will get in this time.
Unlike Mr Witham and Mr Gair, he is
rarely demonstrative, and is anything but
a public speaker.
One of the off-beat features of the
Queensland Senate campaign is a new
party—the United Peoples’ Organisation
of Australia. Why is it off-beat? Well,
it has only 14 members, including its
two Senate candidates, Mr F. B. Thomas,
an Auchenflower earthmoving contractor,
and Mr P. C. Curtis, of Salisbury, who
is a public accountant. Mr Curtis ex-
plained the emergence of the Party by
saying: “If people are really sour with
the recent Parliamentary pay rises, I
think we will poll well.”
The Communist Party has nominated
a team of three, and the Social Credit
League a team of two.
South Australia
'T'he election in South Australia has
A been enlivened by the fight for
Senator Nancy Buttfield's return to
Parliament. South Australia, with its
strong Labor vote, appeared certain to
re-elect the three ALP Senators but a
doubt has been cast by the campaign for
Senator Buttfield’s re-election. Placed

third in the LCL team behind Senator
Laught and Mr G. S. Davidson, she had
little chance of re-election until the
Women-for-Canberra movement was re-
vived. Claiming the Senator was “un-
justifiably demoted” by the LCL, the
movement has urged voters to give
Senator Buttfield first vote and has issued
its own “how-to-vote” card. The Senator
has denied that the card was issued with
her consent, adding, “in a democracy,
people have a right to vote how they
like”.
The card has caused considerable
concern to the LCL, as it could lead to
the defeat of its second candidate, Mr
Davidson. To be successful, the Women-
for-Canberra movement must undermine
the ALP women’s vote, an almost im-
possible task, particularly as the move-
ment is mostly composed of Liberal
women. (It has noticeably ignored the
State’s other woman candidate, Mrs
B. E. Miller, a Communist). If sufficient
LCL supporters followed the movement’s
card, they could cost Mr Davidson his
otherwise assured place.
The reasons for the talkative woman
Senator s fall from favor appear reason-
ably clear. There has been speculation
that her stand with SA Labor Senators
in the rail standardisation debate when
SA was pressing the Commonwealth for
the standardisation of the Port Pirie-
Broken Hill line set the seal on her fate.
The State’s two other LCL candidates
are Senator Laught, a well-liked back-
bencher who is seeking his third term
in the Senate, and the new man, Mr
Davidson, who was defeated as the
LCL’s third candidate in 1958, but
served for several months as a stop-gap
Senator after the death of Senator R. W.
Pearson in September, 1961. The three
ALP men, Senators Toohey, Ridley and
Drury, are impeccable Labor men who
rose from rank-and-file unionists to solid
undistinguished back-benchers in the
Senate. Senator Toohey, who is still a
power in SA Labor politics, appeared
headed for the Federal ALP presidency
when he was stopped short by a heart
attack.
The LCL's advantage of front position
on the ballot paper appears to have been
wasted by a jumble of preferences dis-
tributed up and down the card. This
could lead to mistakes causing costly
informal votes which could have been
avoided with the ALP’s simple across-
the-page system.
Another highlight in South Australia
is the return of the Social Credit move-
ment to the political scene. The move-
ment (it stresses it is not a party) was
formed in SA in the early 1930 s and
unsuccessfully contested the 1934
J. G. GORTON
Federal elections. It then disappeared
from active politics. A few months ago,
the movement was revitalised and it con-
tested a State by-election. However, it
is still an infant party. It is campaigning
for the Senate under the slogan “That
which is physically possible is financially
possible.” Its two candidates, Mr M. E.
Dodd and Mr B. Waters, are both former
LCL members who resigned to join the
Social Credit movement.
An Independent candidate is standing
for the first time for several years in
SA. Mr J. Perth who migrated to Aus-
tralia from Czechoslovakia in 1945 w'hen
he was 12, is an LCL member who is
standing. He wants to encourage interest
in politics among migrants.
Western Australia
Tn Western Australia the structure of
A the State’s five-man Senate contingent
is unlikely to change, but one new face
is almost certain that of 35-year-old
Left-wing Perth lawyer, Mr John Wheel-
don. The Liberal and Country League
suffered a severe shaking when Senator
George Branson made his unfortunate
claims about Dr Evatt and the late Mr
Eddie Ward. But it was too late to do
much about it and both he and Senator
Malcolm Scott the big, grey-haired
farmer whose affability covers a great
deal of political acumen look set for
re-election.
Senator Branson’s bout of foot-in-
mouth disease is lining up as the only
purely-local issue on the West Aus-
tralian scene. The issue of defence and
conscription is particularly inflammable
on the western seaboard, where nearly
100,000,000 non-whites are closer than
Auntie Madge in Brisbane. The vulner-
ability of the State has pointed up
defence and northern development as
the banners of the Senate battle. The
Liberals have won support for their atti-
tude towards defence, despite the emo-
tional appeals by the Opposition on con-
scription. But much of this gain has
been wiped off by the half-hearted atti-
tude towards developing the north.
After months of quiet campaigning,
North-West Minister Charles Court re-
established himself as a popular hero
by his provocatively-timed challenge to
his fellow Liberals in Canberra, to put
up the money for Ord development or
the State would get it elsewhere. The
Opposition Leader, Mr Calwell, is an
anomalous ally indeed in this cause.
With Senators Scott and Branson, West
Australians look set to send Labor’s
No. 1 man on the ticket Senator Harry
Cant, a former AWU industrial officer
who has assured support. But the axe has
at last fallen after nine years on
former railwayman Senator Joe Cooke,
remembered still as a man who walked
out on the 1955 Hobart conference. At
the 1957 election he went back on the
strength of the old form of selection
ballot, with all union members eligible
to vote. Under the changed rules Mr
Wheeldon has displaced him as No. 2
on the list. The young lawyer has dab-
bled in all political hues. He was presi-
dent of the Young Liberal movement
in the West before joining up with the
Fabian Society, and is now identified
with the Left-wing “liberal” groups.
Mr Wheeldon recently was chairman
of the State's anti-hanging committee
but played politics and played it safe
by sticking with his campaign rather
than fighting for multi-murderer Eric
Edgar Cooke. The anti-hanging commit-
tee's cause suffered by his tardiness, but
the cause of John Wheeldon did not.
The fifth position is one with the
shadow of a doubt, though Country
Party farmer Senator Tom Drake-Brock-
man looks set to return to Canberra.

Mr Halbert would have been his chosen

Tasmania
Tf the trend of the May election for the
1 Tasmanian House of Assembly and
the December election for the House of
Representatives is repeated, Tasmania
will return three Labor and two Liberal
senators. The loser would be the DLP’s
parliamentary leader, Senator George
Cole. But elections in Tasmania don’t
I follow patterns. People are always more
! important in determining the results
than are politics or trends. Labor in
December won three of the five House
of Representative seats. And in May it
won an absolute majority in the House
of Assembly, lifting its share of the vote
,from 44.3 per cent in 1959 to 51.3 per
Tent. The Liberal and Country Party
vote made up 43.7 per cent against 40.9
per cent in 1959. DLP and Independents
dropped heavily.
From Cole’s viewpoint the decline in
'the DLP vote in recent years spells
[danger, but Cole is a bigger vote-puller
jfthan any candidate, or group of can-
didates, put up by his party. He may
not have the aura he had when he won
for the DLP after switching from the
ALP, but he has done nothing to blot
his copybook. The weakness of the ALP
land Liberal teams will help Cole. Aylett,
.the runaway senator who went to live
(on the Gold Coast, did not seek ALP
Ire-endorsement. The party picked Don
Devitt to top the team, followed by Sen-
ator O’Byrne and Bert Lacey. Devitt and
can be regarded as certainties,
/but neither is a dominating figure.
The Liberals are running Senators
Marriott and Lillico and party president
Lempriere. None of these, either,
is a big vote-puller. Labor, determined
to kill Cole even if it means helping a
third Liberal’s return, is giving prefer-
ences to the Liberals. The Liberals ask
.for preferences to go to Cole. Cole has
drawn top spot on the ballot paper. If
'.he can muster sufficient votes to lead
'the also-rans after two Liberals and two
labor candidates have been elected, he
.will probably hold his seat IF Lempriere
vis lowest, for Lempriere’s preferences
fwould then carry him in.
Against the recent figures and against
toason, Tasmanians are saying Cole will
‘let back. If he doesn’t, again in contra-
diction of recent voting, they give the
ftird Liberal a shade of odds against
ihe third Labor candidate. But a hand-
ful of votes may decide it.

MELBOURNE Three top officials
of the Tramways Employees’ Associa-
tion —all members of the ALP—last
week had not signed statutory declara-
tions disowning a how-to-vote unity
ticket with the Communist secretary Mr
C. O’Shea and the Communist treasurer,
Mr W. Shooter, distributed at the As-
sociation’s executive post elections the
previous week.
The officials, the president Mr S. E.
Edwards, vice-president Mr N. Mad-
dock and the treasurer Mr J. R. Mc-
Callum were to return the declarations
to the State ALP office by last Monday.
(In 1961 the ALP Federal executive
after a series of unity ticket scandals,
prohibited unity tickets between its
members and members of other political
parties. If members are now named on
a unity ticket, they must sign a statutory
declaration stating that the ticket was
published without their knowledge and
consent.)
One ALP official has described this
Tramways affair as the “most unfortun-
ate publicity the ALP could receive with
the Senate election only a few days
away”.
CIVIL RIGHTS I
Clay Question
MELBOURNE There was hope
last week for 60-year-old Victorian
sheep-shearer, Mr Perc Drever, after the
State Parliament intervened in his long
and costly battle to get reparation for
damage to his property and for his share
in the spoils from the extraction of clay
from the property by two Ballarat brick-
making firms which caused the damage.
Armed with a lease from the Victorian
Mines Department five years ago the
brickmakers descended with their scoops
on Mr Drever’s land and in the inter-
vening years, in his words, have torn
it to pieces, dashing his hopes to retire
there and run about 500 sheep where
only a handful are in present occupation.
What is more, he says, the vultures from
Ballarat have made a fortune out of it,
the Mines Department has taken its
whack to the tune of a shilling a ton on
about 40-50,000 tons, but he has gone
unrewarded and uncompensated. The
Mines Department offered him lid. a
ton which he declined: he is now saying,
/‘Surely a reasonable thing is 6d. a ton
for me.”
(Drever was keeping pretty quiet, how-
ever, about the price he paid for his land
under the title of alienated from the
Crown which was actually only £1 an
acre for 250 acres in an area where the
going freehold price is from £l3O to
£l4O an acre. The suggestion is that for
this price he could hardly complain at
its being skimmed for clay. One under-
stands the Graziers’ Association is in
fact using Mr Drever to get an amend-
ment to the Mines Act which would pre-
vent a similar experience on freeholds.)
Hyper-sensitive to rural problems just
now, the Victorian Government simply
had to agree—and most emphatically—
that Mr Drever had a case. The remedy
may be near at hand. The State Develop-
ment Committee’s recently tabled Report
on Extractive Industries recommended
that, although Mr Drever’s consent was
not required before the brick manu-
facturers moved in, his case should get
special consideration. The committee
also stated that, unless the present
definition of “mineral” in the Mines Act
was amended, other properties, including
some soldier settlement holdings, could
be similarly affected. It suggested that
compensation to landholders for extrac-
tive industry should be higher than for
underground mining.

THE NEAREST THING TO AUTOMATION IN PICTURES
NEW KODAK INSTAMATIC 800 CAMERA-
Never before has picture taking been so simple and reliable. The new Kodak Instamatic 800
Camera does everything for you instantly, automatically. In fact, you needn’t know anything
about photography to get wonderful pictures with this camera. You have a choice of films
to give you colour slides for projection, or colour and black-and-white prints for your album
or wallet. Here’s how:
■ 1. Film loading is instant, automatic, and complete. Simply drop in the Kodapak Film Cartridge,
close the camera, and the exposure meter automatically adjusts to the type of film in use—you’re
ready to shoot! No worry; no guesswork.
■ 2. An internal spring motor advances the film automatically. One winding of a constant-torque
spring by pull-tape action positions the first exposure, advances the film after each exposure (one
exposure a second, if desired), and winds off the trailer.
■ 3. Coupled rangefinder and viewfinder take the guesswork out of distance setting and assure
needle-sharp pictures as well as correct exposure for flash pictures. For quick focus settings, there
are zone focus symbols for “Close”, “Group” and “Scene”.
■ 4. Extra fast 38mm Kodak Ektanar f/2.8 Lens is colour-corrected and “Lumenised”.
■ 5. Shutter speeds are automatically reduced from 1/250 to as low as 1/30 second as exposure
conditions require.
■ 6. There are two exposure controls an electric eye for available light and a focus-linked flash
exposure control. A ‘compensator’ permits plus or minus one full-stop modification of the auto-
matic setting for unusual exposure conditions.
But all you need to know about the Kodak Instamatic 800 Camera is how to aim and press the
shutter . . . and where you find your nearest Kodak Dealer so you can enjoy a demonstration

Knock on
Every Door
SYDNEY The newly formed Foun-
dation for Aboriginal Affairs, inspired by
similar foundations in Canada and New
Zealand, may lead to a new approach
to Aboriginal problems throughout Aus-
tralia. In an endeavour to overcome
the race problem in Sydney, the Foun-
dation is trying to:
• improve educational standards by
trying to keep Aboriginal children at
school (often an Aboriginal child fails to
reach third class);
• lower the infant mortality rate by
training Aboriginal mothers;
• direct more Aborigines into work
where they can learn skills; i
• assist the Aboriginal communities
to break down their shyness and indiffer-j
ence.
This Sunday for the first time in 174
years the people of Sydney are being
asked to contribute to Aboriginal wel-
fare. An army of 30,000 volunteers
will knock on every door for donations
to the appeal which has a target of
£150,000. Already the State Premier,
J. Renshaw, has told the Foundation>
that the Government would contribute
£lO,OOO. At the time of going to press
the Loundation has already received
£23,000. Money raised in the door-
knock appeal will be used to complete
the purchase of an Aboriginal centre in
George Street, Sydney, and to provide I
specialist advice for Aborigines. The*
Foundation also plans to spend £ 12,000
for the provision of scholarships for
Aboriginal primary school children
conjunction with the Department of Edu-
cation.

recently requested the purchase of some(
eight books for a total of £7O. “Each of,
the books was required by me for study,”'
Professor Martin said. In due course the
library got the books —but only after <1
the Customs Department released them
on conditions that treat Professor Martin,
or any professor, like a child in primary

Society”. The conditions that the Cus-
toms have imposed, in writing, on all
the books involved are: (1) that the
reader —including any professor—agrees
to use the publication only in the super-
vised area and that his reading be marked
off against his signature; and (2) that he
agrees not to reproduce the whole or any
part of the contents of the publication.
“Under the application of the first
condition,” said Professor Martin, “I
have to visit the library each time I want
to refer to any of these books, ask the
librarian for a key to a cupboard which
he unlocks in my presence. I then must
sign for the book, peruse it only while
in the assistant librarian’s office, sign
again when I hand it back and depart.
Under the second condition I may not
quote any portion of any of the books
in my lectures in Clinical Psychology at
seminars or in my discussions with
medical, science and arts students con-
cerning their work in Abnormal
Psychology.”
Professor Martin is particularly baffled
by the circumstances surrounding the
release of “Abnormal Sexual Behavior”
and “The Homosexual Society”. To
obtain both those books from Customs,
the University Vice-Chancellor, Pro-
fessor John Baxter, had to make a
personal application. “For a while there
we thought the Vice-Chancellor would
have to go down and collect them from
the Customs people himself. But I was
allowed to do that,” Professor Martin
went on. “Another regulation—that the
books be burnt once we had obtained
what we wanted from them —was waived
in the case of these two. Instead, they
could be kept but made available only
upon the written recommendation of the
Head of the Faculty for the purpose of
post-graduate or original research. The
extraordinary thing is that ‘The Homo-
sexual Society’ was financed by a grant
from Britain’s Home Office and is merely
a survey of the number and types of
homosexuals in Britain. It reveals nothing
about their intimate behavior, clinically,
and could in no way be considered
pornographic. It is freely available at
London bookstalls, but here well,
apparently the title must have scared
them.”
Something similar seems to have been
the case in the ban on “Abnormal Sexual
Behavior”. It is a collection of papers
already delivered to medical societies of
a specialist nature throughout the world.
“Most of its contents have already been
freely distributed in Australian medical
journals,” said Professor Martin. Mean-
while, until the Customs Department
loosens its regulations governing his re-
quested £7O parcel of books, he has
advised University authorities concerned
that he “cannot honestly use them”.

Takeovers
MELBOURNE Following the
earlier acquisition of a 25 per cent
interest in Angus and Rflbertson by
William Collins of London, and 3 per
cent by other British publishers, the
cause of the independents in Australian
book publishing looked to have been
dealt another stunning blow last week.
The near 40-year-old F. W. Cheshire
group fell prey to an Anglo-Australian
combination, Wilke and Co. of Mel-
bourne and the International Publishing
Corporation of London (through its
Australian subsidiary Odhams Press).
The consideration for the takeover was
the tidy sum of £846,000, half in Wilke
shares and half in London cash.
The takeover reduces the number of
substantial independent book publishers
in Australia to a mere handful. Apart
from Melbourne University Press, which
has been on the upgrade in the last few
years under its new enterprising direction,
Melbourne is left with only a couple
of any size, of which Georgian House
would be the biggest: Adelaide of course
has Rigby’s and Sydney the energetic
Ure Smith. Sydney University Press has
hardly got going yet and has still to
publish a book. Queensland University
Press has carried the flag of the indepen-
dents alone in that State since the
absorption of Jacaranda by Wilke, but
its output is hardly prolific.
Other Melbourne publishers saw the
main clue to the move in the necessary
provision of more working capital. The
recent message of the chairman, 68-year-
old Mr F. W. Cheshire, to his staff,
assured them that “to all intents and
purposes” the three companies of the
group would carry on as before and
under the same managements, and,
significantly he added that arrangements
had been made to get more working
capital. The trade believes the latter
had been in acutely short supply at
Cheshire’s and that this was mainly
responsible for throwing the firm into
the arms of Wilke and Co., which has
long been handling about a third of
Cheshire’s printing and is believed to
have been a substantial creditor.
The trade ventured the further opinion
that Cheshire’s cash flow must have been
slowed by the firm’s generous credit
terms on sales of text books to schools,
believed to have been as long as eighteen
months’ credit. For a group in whose
book lists text books predominate this
could have been a killer. Equally, profit
margins on text books sold to schools
are notoriously narrow. The usual dis-
count allowed would be as high as 331
per cent.
Despite the high-looking price paid
for Cheshire’s, Wilke at least appears to
have got its share on the cheap, being
able to use the 10s. premium on its ss,
share to absolute maximum effect as
the share exchange terms were based on
the current market price of 15s. for its
shares. This confirms the trade’s impres-
sion that Wilke was in the position of
being able to strike a very hard bargain.
It could be just warming up to the take-
over game. Two years ago it failed in
a bid for P. C. Grosser in a tussle with
British Tobacco but succeeded with
Jacaranda Press and two other Brisbane
companies later.
Although its main interest is still in
printing, Wilke now emerges as a tour
de force in Australian book publishing,
It already produces the Australian
editions of the “Reader’s Digest” and
“Time” and also the Melbourne tele-
phone directory. Its tie-up with the

J. C. HORSFALL
POLICE
Bischof Purge
BRISBANE ALP member for
South Brisbane Mr C. J. Bennett last
week charged in the State Parliament that
the Queensland Police Force morale was
lower than it had ever been. “There is
no consistency in the administration of
the force,” he said. Mr Bennett was com-
menting on the recent transfer of all nine
detectives in the CIB Consorting Squad
by the Queensland Police Commissioner,
Mr Frank Bischof. [The transfers, which
took place on Monday last week, were
announced in a special list attached to
the CIB roster. One of Queensland’s
best-known detectives, the Consorting
Squad chief, Detective M. A. Hopgood,
has been assigned to the prosecuting
staff while others have been transferred
elsewhere.] Mr Bennett said: “If it was
necessary to transfer one or two men it
certainly would not have been necessary
to transfer the whole squad.”
Flowever, the Minister in charge of
Police, Mr A. Dewar, said that there was
no particular reason for the transfer for
such moves were going on all the time
as part of the reallocation of police
duties. Last week, on top of the transfer
issue, Mr Dewar announced that 20 one-
man police stations in country towns
would close while the staff of 15 more
country stations, now carrying between
two and eight police, would be reduced.
The Queensland Police Force has
rarely been out of the news in recent
months. Only two months ago a police
sergeant who had been awarded the
George Medal was sacked from the force
after a Brisbane magistrate convicted
him on three charges of stealing goods
handed in at a police station as lost
property. From December until April the
force came under investigation at the
National Hotel Royal Commission. How-
ever, the Commission found that no
member of the force was guilty of mis-
conduct in relation to the operation of
the hotel. Even so the publicity must
have been damaging, not only to the
reputation of the force, but to the morale
of its members.

ON THE MARGIN
The Doves
and the Owl
HPhey are saying in Britain that students
are too much distracted from work
by their carryings on with the opposite
sex. One of those to make the complaint
is, surprisingly, Angus Wilson, who in
his novels seems tolerant of such failings.
“Love affairs take up all their time at
the university now,” he said sadly.
The problem is not new. Anyone who
has sampled tertiary education, as it is
unpleasantly called today (as if it were
the advanced stage of a disease), knows
that love is the most dangerous spanner
in the works of learning.
We have literary evidence that this has
long been so. Chaucer in The Miller’s
Tale sensitively described the romance
between an Oxford undergraduate and a
carpenter’s wife, in the course of which
he was burned on the behind by a rival
with a red-hot poker. More recently
Somerset Maugham, in Of Human Bond-
age, showed how hard it is for a student
to get on with a medical course when he
is more interested in a waitress.
It is an unfortunate coincidence that
the only period of their lives when young
people have a chance to acquire higher
learning should be the very time when
they are most plagued by low thoughts.
Many men suffer penalties because in
their bird-watching youth they were more
devoted to the doves of Venus than the
owl of Minerva.
The harassed schoolmaster might now
be enjoying the opulence of an academic
post if Amanda Rompworthy’s ripe
charms had not prevented him from
taking a good degree. The clerk might
have become a company director had he
not thrown up his evening course in
accountancy to pursue Desiree Jones.
Various attempts have been made to
get round the difficulty. The oldest is
the Oxbridge plan of segregating male
students in compounds called colleges,
and locking them up at night. It may
have worked once, but when I saw it at
Oxford the system had been much under-
mined. Among the underminers were
comely Scandinavian blondes who came
to the town “to learn the language”. A
university poet wrote bitterly of
Sweden’s icy maidens, virtuous bunch,
Who take but give no recompense for
lunch.
As this heart-cry attests, failure in love
can be as distracting to a student as
success.
Certain American colleges have gone
to the other extreme. Instead of trying
to keep the boys and girls apart, they
encourage them to get together. At
Embraceable U, in Florida, for example,
students used to be able to major in
Pure and Applied Dating, being given
credits for practical work. Since the
Sputniks the Embraceable curriculum has
been tightened up, to compete with Rus-
sia. But the students make more passes
outside the exam room than they obtain
inside.
A new approach to the problem has
been tried lately through chemistry. The
German drug Antirand is claimed to
stimulate the intellect and deaden the
amorous impulse at the same time.
According to the manufacturers, stri-
king results were obtained in test runs
at the University of Gottingen. A stu-
dent named Franz Dopfelbunger, who
barely scraped through first year econo-
mics after a series of love affairs, volun-
teered for a course of Antirand. At
once (it is stated) he shot to the top of
his year. Another subject, Brunnhilde
Schlotz, had failed second year medicine
through an intense involvement with a
guitar-player. After taking Antirand she
won a gold medal for physiology.
However, a leading Sydney physician
whom I questioned on this drug was
sceptical. “Our latest information,” he
said, “is that Antirand has unpredictable
side-effects. The student Dopfelbunger
may have done well in his exams, but he
has taken to wearing women’s dresses.
And Brunnhilde Scholtz has developed
the Leda syndrome—she spends her
spare time in parks mooning over swans.”
In short, there is still no remedy in
sight for the situation that worries Angus

A revolutionary suggestion was put
to me by a man who failed a dentistry
course and is now a taxi-driver. He
maintained that university studies should
be postponed until later in life, when the
students would be able to concentrate
better. “With no girls on our minds,
what brilliant scholars and scientists we
could become!” he said.
But I doubt whether the idea would
work. I would rather have my teeth
filled by a dentist who had been to the
university—even if he was a student
Casanova—than by one who proposed to
begin his dental course in 1975.

The Enigma of Hopman
"The softest-hearted fella "
By J. C. KAYE
Henry Christian (Harry) Hopman
was 58 in August. His sft Bin.
figure is trim and fit. His tanned
skin is fresh, and although his fair hair
has thinned a bit, it's still there. His way
of doing things is direct and courteous,
until, presumably, he is roused to wrath.
To his admirers, Harry Hopman, as
a Davis Cup captain and manager and
as a moulder of young champions, is the
best thing that has ever happened to
Australian tennis. As Hopman says
when his critics open up: “The results
speak for themselves.”
He captained the team that won the
Davis Cup in 1939—the first success for
Australia, as against “Australasia”.
Under his direction, Australia captured
the trophy from the Americans in 1950,
and held it to 1953. The Cup was lost
again in 1954, but Australia took it back
in 1955 and held it to 1957.
Away it went again to the USA in
1958, but Australia took it in 1959, and
held on against American, Italian and
Mexican challengers until America won
in 1963. This year we got it back again.
That amounts to 12 wins since the war,
in 14 challenge rounds. It’s a dogged
never-give-up achievement.
Asa maker of players, Hopman’s work
has fallen into two categories. As team
manager for the Cup and overseas tours
he has had everyone of note under his
wing and under his discipline, but on
certain young players he has spent more
personal care.
He began with Sedgman and McGre-
gor after the war. When they went pro-
fessional, he continued with the teenagers
Hoad and Rosewall. They went over,
and he pressed on with youngsters like
Emerson and Laver.
Today Laver is lost to the pros.
Emerson is saved, at least temporarily.
Stolle is in good form. Hopman is al-
ready concentrating on another lot. He
works now with players like John New-
combe and Tony Roche, and speaks well
of the promise of teenagers like John
Cooper, 17, Ashley Cooper’s brother.
It’s the same picture of patient drive
towards a goal, with difficulties worried
or blasted aside, or somehow sidestepped
or undermined. When the selectors
passed over his protege, Sedgman, early
on, Hopman induced a Melbourne news-
paper to open a fund to send Sedgman
overseas.
When Jack Kramer was angling for
both Rosewall and Hoad with big bait in
1955, it was Hopman who raced about
getting new or better jobs to hold them
in amateurism for a while longer.
In the recent row between the LTAA
and Emerson, Stolle, Mulligan and
Hewitt over failure to keep to the asso-
ciation rules on travel, Hopman worked
to get the top talent back into his team.
He got into the thick of tennis politics,
working for the formula that enabled
Emerson and Stolle to make a last-minute
appearance in Mexico City this year.
In his handling of players, there have
been many times when he has stood by
them against officialdom—even as he was
making them work until they drooped;
even though he was tough in his sys-
tem of small fines to teach them his
ideas of obedience and manners.
When Lew Hoad and Jennifer Staley
married in London in 1955, for example,
it was Hopman who told the angry
LTAA to go jump in the lake. When
Rosewall collapsed with a facial cramp
in Brisbane in 1956, and officials were
worried about keeping the match alive
and the 6000 spectators happy, Hop-
man’s attitude was: to hell with the
crowd, think of Rosewall.
There are many stories of Hopman
the disciplinarian. Some sports writers
have called him “Little Hitler”, “Little
Khrush”, “The Man with the Whip” and
“The Computer”. There’s no doubt he
can be strict. And wild.
On the courts, he shouts at opposing
players; he demands spikes and gets
spikes; he challenges decisions; he defies
officialdom.
He picks gargantuan rows and has
made enemies like Drobny, who wrote in
his autobiography in 1955: “When I see
Hopman I get angry.” There was a
storm when Hopman criticised the parti-
ality of the Wimbledon crowd after
Drobny's defeat of Rosewall in the
singles final in 1954. Hopman was a
bit tactless. Wimbledon is so sacred.
But it all blew over.
Hopman puts it this way: “If you can’t
get something done the right way, you
have to do something to get it done. If
what is going on is wrong, you don’t sit
there and play thinks.” Dale Carnegie
would not approve.
Hopman's critics will not accept all the
pictures I have painted so far. They say
that Hopman is overrated as a team
manager and as a maker of players. They
accept that he makes his players superbly
fit, and able to stand up to long matches,
and that he keeps them well-mannered
on the courts.
They add, however, that he does not
do much to improve his players’ stroke
play, and that he has weaknesses as a
tennis tactician. They say that while
Hopman's discipline is all right for
“babies”, like Hoad and Rosewall were
at the start, it is absurd for older men.

Critics have included several of Hop-
man’s former charges—both Rosewall
and Hoad, Mai Anderson, and Mervyn
Rose. Rose is one who never did get
along too well with Harry. The critics
have a case. Taking orders is always
hard. A man who gives a lot of orders
can't always be right.
Hopman, in dealing with these criti-
cisms, makes no great claims for himself
■ —except to point to the results.
“My main contribution,” he says, “is
to give the boys fitness and endurance.”
He had no coach himself, and he is not
primarily a stroke-shaper. By the time
players come to him their strokes are
pretty well formed, anyway.
“I prefer people to see me as a Davis
Cup captain, and not as a coach for the
team in the usual sense,” he said.
But apart from fitness, endurance and
good behavior he has instilled at least
two sound principles. One is the con-
cept of attacking hard any serve short
of an ace, or near ace. Under Hop-
man's supervision you don’t just get a
ball back, you hit hard and away from
the server.
Another of his lessons is of relaxed
force at time of crisis. With Hopman
you don't go cautious when the whole
thing is in the balance, as Bromwich did,
for example, when he lost the Wimbledon
title to Falkenburg in 1948, although he
had games up his sleeve. You “relax
and go for the lines”.
Another factor with Hopman is that
you know —while he is beside the court —
there is at least someone in the world
whose whole heart is in your success. He
sees what others do not see because he is
not watching the flight of the ball, he is
watching the players.
Lew Hoad put it this way: “Unless
you have experienced something similar,”
he wrote, “I am sure you cannot appre-
ciate the degree of help someone like
Hop can give you when the strain is on
during a tight Davis Cup match.
“He can tell if our opponents are
‘picking’ our best shots or whether they
are staying back a little more than usual,
or whether, say, Vic Seixas is moving in
after service, anticipating a down-the-
line or a cross-court shot.”
When Stolle beat Ralston in five sets
in the crucial singles of the last Davis
Cup match against USA he came off the
court and said: “I couldn’t have done it
without you, Hop.”
From this sort of evidence people out-
side the tennis world can only conclude
} that, for all his alleged failings, Hopman
has been of value.
A lot of Hopman’s character becomes
clearer with a little knowledge of his
family. He is the son of a teacher,
who became headmaster of Rosehill
Public School, Sydney. Three of his
sisters became teachers. One brother,
John, three years older, is a tennis coach
in Cambodia.
In the Hopman family old-fashioned
virtues like courage, perseverance,
modesty, obedience and loyalty were
drummed home.
As a player, he had many successes.
He took the Australian doubles twice
with Jack Crawford, and the mixed four
times with Nell Hopman, whom he
married 30 years ago. For three years
running he took the singles title of South
Australia, and also the mixed and men’s
doubles.
Using his head
ITe was once runner-up to his friend
Jack Crawford for the Australian
singles title. At various times he had wins
over Budge and Vines. He and Nell got
to the Wimbledon mixed final once,
losing to Perry and Dorothy Round.
Crawford has told how Hopman, a
terrier of a player, fought every point to
the last, and always used his head well
in plotting tactics.
Harry and Nell Hopman have no
children, and some say this has made him
a little over-paternal in his control of
young people. But children like him.
He goes to the courts every Sunday to
coach a class. You see kids run up to
take his hand.
Players come from all over the world
to seek him out. The latest to arrive is
Christer Holm, the young Swede who
dropped in unexpectedly during Mel-
bourne Cup Week.
Hopman, who is an investment coun-
sellor, with a seat on the Melbourne
Stock Exchange, never drives a car when
he can walk, and will exercise at a city
gym before going to his desk. He eats
plenty of steaks and fresh fruit but—an
old-style family touch—still loves bread
and butter.
He has the MBE and CBE. He is
president of the LTAV and a selector
since 1962. He is president of the
National Sportsmen’s Association. Prac-
tically every week he gives talks to
lunches or meetings.
He lives in Goodall Street, Hawthorn,


with no private tennis court. Financially,
the Hopmans are moderately comfort-
able but far from rich. He has turned
down several overseas offers to coach
professionally, which would have made
him a wealthier man.
In 1956, he was given £7OOO in a
testimonial raised in Victoria. In 1961
he won a £20,000 libel claim against
Mirror Newspapers, Sydney, which
printed rumors that Hopman had re-
ceived £3OOO from South Africa for his
coaching tour there in 1956. Actually
Hopman coached in South Africa for
modest expenses only, and when an
attempt was made to give him a wallet
of notes, he passed notes back.
The remarkable fact about Hopman’s
career in tennis is that it has all been as
an amateur. What it has cost him in
time spent away from work would take
a lot of adding up.
An operation in 1963 changed Hop-
man’s life greatly. It cleared the deaf-
ness that had troubled him increasingly
since before the last war. Typically, he
said nothing to Nell about the operation
until a few hours before. He went out
one lunchtime and had it done.
He talks without any visible envy of
“What d'you mean boy-friend? It's me that's got to go!"
the fortunes made by professionals like
Rosewall and Hoad.
Hopman is pleased that, since the new
professionalism began, it has been pos-
sible for a champion to find the pot of
gold. The life is hard, he says, with its
continuous travel and the limited range
of competition. But the money is there
all right. To name only one, Lew Hoad
has probably grossed about £250,000.
He feels, as things are, that the richest
days of the pro circuit are over. The
sponsors are not coming forward as they
did, and unless the circuit can continue
to draw off the top amateur champions
public interest must continue to decline.
He sees no advantage for the amateur
game in opening tournaments to pros.
The amateur associations are not rich,
and the pros would need a large part of
the gate. Not even in golf, he points
out, do amateur and pro players play
each other, but compete against the card.
Hopman does not expect Emerson to
turn pro at the moment, if ever. Emer-
son, in his opinion, is happy with the
amateur game, and with his job with a
tobacco company.
Loyal as ever to his own men, Hop-
man names Emerson as the fastest and
fittest player in the world, without ques-
tion. Would Emerson beat Laver? “In
a match played right now —yes.”
Ban on Press *
TTopman opposes LTAA restrictions on
players’ travel. He doesn’t think they
should be kept home longer to benefit
tennis in the Australian countryside.
Players spend five months a year in Aus-
tralia as it is, and that is enough. He
sees no way out of the “shamateurism”
problem.
He is very much for a continued ban
on statements to the Press by all members
of official teams. His argument is that
players can harm their own interests too
easily by some remark that gives away
a secret of form or tactics, or even
needles an enemy to a higher pitch.
Hopman expects Australia to keep the
Davis Cup in 1965. Outside Australia
and USA, he sees Sweden, and perhaps
Germany, as possible future winners.
He believes Russia is still about 10
years away from the top. “They need
a new generation of coaches to come
forward,” he said. “They have to get
away from the old base-line play ideas,
and really learn the net game.”
He attributes most of the attacks on
him in overseas newspapers to the malice
of sports columnists and others who have
been refused favors, or are bitter about
his policy of letting no team member
make Press statements.
He reacts with detachment, but a piece
in “Time” got under his skin a bit re-
cently. Published after Australia's Davis
Cup win it both praised and damned as
“Time” pieces often do. It quoted him
as saying that if the Americans wanted to
win the Cup they had better “get some-
one like me in charge”.
“I did not say that at all,” he said.
“Someone from ‘Time’ telephoned me.
I answered a few questions about the
match. I praised the US captain Vic
Seixas—l’d done that earlier at the public
presentation of the Cup.”
Then “Time” spun its comment.
Hopman smiles if you call him a “fox”
—but if you call him a braggart that’s
another matter.
The “Time” piece quoted a “writer
who has been trailing him around for
years” as the source for the saying that
“Harry is a bad winner”. Actually this
remark originated with the Mexican cap-
tain, Contreras, after Australia had licked
Mexico this year.
The Mexicans expected to take the
round —with Emerson and Stolle unavail-
able—and collect 70,000 dollars for ap-
pearing in the challenge round. This all
went west when Emerson arid Stolle came
back into the Australian fold.
Hopman denies that he never admits
he is wrong. “Of course, I have made
mistakes,” he said. “If anyone points

them out as a reasonable case, I am
happy to listen and learn.”
Hopman denies, too, that he has lost
interest in his former players, since they
became professionals.
“I keep an eye on what the boys are
doing,” he says, “but the way everyone
is on the move, there is little chance of
personal contact.”
Hopman will not be going away with
Australian tourists in 1965. The Cup is
here, however, and if he is asked he will
be in charge of its defence again.
The manager of any touring team will
probably be Neale Fraser.
As years go by now, Hopman will
probably become more a leader in top
tennis officialdom. The LTAV presi-
dency is seen as a first step to presidency,
in time, of the LTAA.
He likes a drink
11/hether he will learn to turn the
" charm on more adroitly, as custom
requires, we have yet to see.
Friends say that Hopman has warmed
noticeably in social contacts since his
operation cured the deafness in his right
tear, although his hearing on the left side
[is still bad. He has a mixed set of
’friends, from the tennis, business and
1 other worlds of Melbourne. As a fitness
fan he doesn’t smoke; but he likes a
drink.
His role as president of the Sports-
men's Association keeps him on the
move, and as a speaker at lunches, din-
ners, schools and clubs, he is one of the
busiest in Australia.
It was at a luncheon in Brisbane a
year or two ago that he said Mervyn
Rose's earnings as an amateur were pro-
bably about £3OOO or £4OOO a year—a
remark that later bounced around the
court in his libel case.
When the LTAA said Margaret Smith
could not practise with the Australian
women’s team that she quit through
dislike of the team’s manager, Nell Hop-
man, Harry pulled no punches.
At a Sportsmen’s Association dinner
in Hobart he got stuck into the LTAA’s
critics, and it became a warm old night.
His marriage has always been happy.
He takes pride in Nell—at the moment
' in the way she has, single handed, raised
£15,000 from Melbourne business houses
for the Federation Cup to be played in
Melbourne in January before the Austra-
lian titles.
At weekends Nell and Harry play what
she calls “hit and giggle” tennis.
Ask him directly: “What sort of guy
are you, Harry?”
He grins and answers: “I’m the softest-
hearted fella in the world, really.”
All the same, I think that if I were
told: “Harry Hopman is going to take
you over and get you into shape,” I’d
blanch noticeably.


Return of a Champion
“Don’t like fights anymore , just old people , animals
and little kids ”
By HUGH CURNOW
The trail leading to Australia’s former
champion boxer Ron Richards was
littered with raised eyebrows. It
began at Ern McQuillan’s gym in Syd-
ney’s Newtown. There mention that Ron
was back in town raised Era’s eyebrows,
if only in appreciation of some sort of
mildly conspiratorial joke. “Yes, Ron’s in
Sydney. I saw him the other day—took
him out to his sister’s place at 30 Consti-
tution Road, Petersham, and got him
lined up with a job. Least I think that
was the address.” He called across two
sparring fighters to a blond-haired man
in a bronze shirt and off-white trousers
and shoes. “Hey, Snowy. What was that
address we took Ron Richards to? Con-
stitution Road?”
There was a pause, then Snowy called
out, “That's right,” and returned to his
interrupted chat with another sportily-
dressed spectator. “Yes, that was it,”
said McQuillan, “I think he’s living with
his sister there. He’s leading a good life,
working and what-have-you. It was good
to see him, really it was.”
McQuillan’s present gym, a shadow of
his former all-Australian boxing stable,
had come to a brief halt at the shouted
sound of Ron’s name. As Australia’s
middleweight, light-heavyweight, heavy-
weight and cruiserweight champion for
three years from 1938, “Ron Richards”
still meant something, it seemed. Now
Clive Stewart, the 26-year-old Australian
light-heavyweight champion and Austra-
lasian middleweight champion, resumed
light sparring with a partner. American
boxer, Ray Perez, stretched flat on his
back on the floor, began doing his deep-
breathing exercises again, fighting off a
cold in the head. And Daryl Harrison,
the up-and-coming bantamweight from
Gympie in Queensland, took another
grip on a pair of skipping-rope handles.
Before I left McQuillan whammed a
medicine-ball half a dozen times onto
Stewart’s stomach from a height. The
supine Stewart didn't even grunt.
Constitution Road was not in Peter-
sham but in Dulwich Hill. Number 30,
a single-storied tenement bungalow, was
locked and the doorbell went unanswered.
The woman next door suggested the local
shop as a source of information regard-
ing Ron’s whereabouts as she “didn’t
want to get mixed up in it”. The woman
behind the corner shop’s counter said
the last she had seen of Ron since he
returned to Sydney from the Aboriginal
settlement on Palm Island six weeks ago
was when he went away with someone
two nights earlier. She suggested some-
body at Number 10, around the corner,
might know where he had gone yesterday
and today.
The woman who opened the door at
Number 10, was apprehensive at first.
“Are you from the Welfare people?” she
asked. Then, when the reply was “No”,
she said: “I don’t know where Ron
is. I just wish I did. He spent last night
here, then left this morning just wearing
a pair of khaki shorts, sandals and a
white shirt. Who am I? I’m Ron’s wife.
He walked in here six weeks ago from
Palm Island. It’s the first time I had
seen him in 17 years. Yes, it was quite
a shock.” She suggested the hotel at
Dulwich Hill might be the best place to
start looking.
The barmaid there said Ron had just
left. It was 10.20 a.m. Some of the
boys breasting the bar said they thought
he had taken the bus to Enmore and the
Warren View Hotel which opens at
6.30 a.m.
The barmaid at the Warren View said
Ron hadn't arrived there yet, today. The
boys sitting on the pub’s threshold with
their thonged feet on the pavement said
they thought Ron might turn up later.
At 11.40 a.m. he walked across the
street wearing, not khaki shorts and
sandals, but full-length khaki trousers
and riding boots. Ron Richards’ gait has
been peculiar since his legs began playing
tricks on him some 15 years ago. He
places one foot gingerly in front of the
other and shifts his weight awkwardly
forward, on his heels instead of his toes.
Something of a cheer went up from the
boys as he reached the Warren View.
“Come on in and I’ll buy you all a
beer,” he said. Two men in unwashed
shirts accompanied him inside to the bar.
The barmaid raised her eyebrows and
asked them what they would have.
“Three beers,” said Richards, and,
catching sight of me at his elbow, added:
“And one for Bill here.” I told him I
wasn't Bill and I was from The
Bulletin. “Ah, Consolidated Press,
mate? You see—-I still got all me think-
ing straight! Have a beer, anyway.” We
had several.
Ron Richards, now 52, looks as fit as
a youngster. Only his legs give him
away when he walks. He prefers to sit
down when drinking. “I get tired,” he
said, rubbing his unshaven, salt-and-
pepper-whiskered chin. Had he been in
any trouble lately? “Yes, mate. I have.
Reckon I'll head back to Queensland as
soon as I can get a few quid together.
Got a job as a carpenter’s laborer. Pays
£l9 a week. Reckon I’ll do that again
in a few days and get back to Queens-
land on a Welfare pass I’m entitled to.
Wish I was there now. No, I wouldn’t
miss the grog on Palm Island. White
blokes smuggle it in for us. They give
it to us once a week—on Sundays. They
pick us up in a truck and drive us out
back of the settlement and open up the
beer. Doesn't do any harm, once a
week. It’s this drinking every day that
wrecks a man. But what can a bloke
do in Sydney except drink? Especially a
colored bloke like me.”
He talked of his “last fight”, when,
as he remembers it, he beat Dave Sands’
brother, Richie, in eight rounds at Byd-

ney Stadium in 1943. “That was a
beauty. I retired after that because I
was getting too old. And while I had
all my own teeth.” He grinned wide.
“Still got ’em, mate. See? That's some-
thing for a fighting man.” He also re-
membered overhearing a fighter in
Townsville say before their bout: “I’m
going to knock that black bastard out.”
“I saw red then. I knocked him out of
the ring into his own grandmother’s lap.
I reckon that was a real good fight,
too.”
Used to working on Palm Island farms,
Richards is proud of his present physical
condition. “Ever seen me stripped? You
should see me stripped, mate! I’m look-
ing like I’m making a comeback, you'd
think. Sometimes I take a look at myself
in a full-length mirror and I say, ‘You’re
in good shape, Ron, mate’. That’s what
I call myself and everyone —Mate. It’s
a real Queensland word. Black or white,
they all use it. ‘Flow are yer, mate?’
they say . . , It’s real good up there.”
He said his wife, Colleen, used to be
an Irish beauty when he left her to find
work at Palm Island “14 years ago”.
Now the pride of his life, he says, is his
granddaughter, also named Colleen. “My
daughter Bernadette had her about two
years ago. I came down to see the little
kid. She’s a beauty. I love old people
and animals and little kids. Don't like
fights any more, just old people, animals
and little kids. When they got me up
on the platform at the White City
stadium the other night and introduced
me to the crowd as the former champion
middleweight, light-heavyweight and
heavyweight boxer of Australia and
everyone applauded, it was all right, I
suppose, but it’s nothing like seeing that
little Colleen. She’s got real lovely blue
eyes and olive skin. My grandfather was
an Englishman. He married a half-
Maori girl. My father married a half-
Aboriginal. Now my granddaughter has
got the blue eyes. She’s a real beaut,
she is.” He smiled happily to himself.
After a steak-and-eggs lunch, Richards
began to complain about the heat and
said he needed another drink. Instead
he agreed to have a shave. The first
barber, an Australian, took one look at
him and said, “We don't do shaves.” The
next barber, a Greek, said he’d be glad
to shave “such a great man”. When he
finished and patted lotion on Richards
face, he shook his hand.
Back in the street Richards said he
smelt “like a billiard saloon”, but he
reckoned the boys would understand.
Then with a cheery good-bye he weaved
off, headed, he said, for Queensland. But
first he had to make one call. “Give
my best to all the boys at Ern’s place!”
he called over his shoulder as he stepped
out into the suburban traffic and crossed,
stiff-legged, to the Warren View Hotel.
As Young as He Feels
By PETER GREEN
As we left the Princess Theatre a
young lady called out: “When will
you be back, Mr Howes?” “About
3.30, love. Wait for me up on the bed.”
There was a girlish giggle in reply. When
one is 69 years one gets away with re-
marks like that. Bobby Howes is a
small, cheeky-looking man in glasses,
who is inclined to effervesce at the right
moment. He has been in the British
comedy business for 55 years on stage
and screen and at first sight he looks
a little happier than most comedians.
But he is sensitive about his age. “I’m
69 in body, but not mentally. I was still
doing somersaults, back flips and acrobats
until I was 52. Not bad. I hate mixing
with people of my own age. To be young
you’ve got to keep mixing with young
people. And I don’t like a lot of
intelligent talk, politics and stuff. I like
down-to-earth people.”
He sounded earnest but really he was
being most jaunty. As he was talking he
was giving instructions all around the
coffee shop, telling the proprietor he was
missing business at the front counter.
There was no point in asking him why
“Finian’s Rainbow” had taken 17 years
to come to Australia. Back in 1948 there
were other musicals about, easier and
simpler to stage. “Finian’s Rainbow”
was set in the mythical southern state
of Mistucky, which immediately posed
the colored question, called for some
colored cast, and even worse, child
actors.
Bobby Howes said: “I was Finian in
a big production in Liverpool in ’5B. An
American woman put up £BO,OOO. I’ve


always loved the show. It’s got every-
thing humor, a bit of Irish whimsy
and, above all, wonderful music. Well,
after that I was invited to do it at the
City Center in New York. I didn’t even
ask the price. Americans always pay
big. Nobody told me this was a prestige
show and all stars were paid the same as
the chorus. Do you know what I got?
103 dollars 85 cents a week.
“Was I surprised? I was rocked. But
they did pay a big cheque for expenses.
We were a success at the Center, so
Finian went to Broadway. Yes, just
in time for the strike. We were only
on a week and after the strike it was
impossible to come back, not unless you
had big advance booking. Pay that time?
I got 500 British quids.”
He likes to talk about his daughter,
Sally Ann Howes, and he talks with real
fatherly pride. “At the moment she’s
on Broadway in the female lead of
‘What Makes Sammy Run’. She married
an American, you know, Richard Adler.
He wrote the music and lyrics for ‘The
Pajama Game’ and ‘Damn Yankees’.
Sally Ann has been in so many shows. I
can’t remember them all.”
It was time to ease the discussion
back to father himself. “TV? No, not
my cuppa tea. I can’t stand the cameras.
I get mesmerised looking at those dead,
glass eyes which follow you everywhere.
Then they put chalk marks on the floor.
You gotta stand here, you gotta move
there. You’ve gotta sit down slowly,
stand up slowly, so that the cameras
can follow. Aw, bloody awful. Yes, I
like films and I’ve made a lot of films.
But I never get out anywhere decent on
location. Sally Ann . . . what happens
to her? She appears with ‘The Admirable
Crichton’ and she goes to Bermuda. Me!
"Didn't you blokes hear me yell out land ahoy?"
Once I got to Watford just out of Lon-
don. Another time I went to the cement
works on the Greys in Essex. Beautiful
lungfuls of cement dust.”
Bobby Howes, apart from the US, has
had no major trips. “I like Melbourne,
the feel and the atmosphere, and the
style of living. I like a big city. My
lungs are so full of carbon monoxide
that if I go out into the country and
take a good, deep breath of fresh air,
I’m practically dead for a week. I’ve
got to come back to the city and breathe
in carbon monoxide to recover.
“I’d like to be out here for a year or
two. Go right round Australia with
‘Finian’s Rainbow’, then to New
Zealand. If things look that good, I’ll
send a cable to my son, John ... he
plays the clarinet with the London Phil-
harmonic . . . and I’ll say, ‘Sell the flat,
darling, I’m not coming home’.”
So we walked back to the Princess
Theatre and I introduced him to the
statue of Burke and Wills opposite.
Bobby Howes claimed that originally he
was an Irishman from Cork and it
seemed a good idea to introduce him
to another Irishman who had made a
name around here.
Rebel with a Cause
By ALAN DEAR
Gordon Barton looks like a man
who splits his time between Adel-
aide and Sydney. Tall and stringy,
he seems to live on nervous energy. He
is the head of IPEC, the Interstate Par-
cels Express Company based in Adelaide,
which is seeking Federal Government
permission to import planes to run an
Australia-wide cargo service. Pure cargo,
no passengers. His efforts to date have
been frustrating, to say the least, but he
will take it as far as a fight in court with
the Government to get what he and his
fellow directors want.
Born on August 30, 1929, in Surabaya,
Indonesia, of a Dutch mother and a
North Queensland father, Barton came
to Australia at the age of two. “My father
was a pearl fisherman, my mother was
a school teacher employed by the Dutch
Government in the Dutch East Indies, as
it was then. I did not go back to Indo-
nesia until 1957, when I was 27. Be-
cause my mother was a school teacher
I spent only nine years at school at
Shore and left when I was 18.
“School had one salutary effect on
me,” he said, “it gave me a hearty dislike
of authority. I do not like the old school.
It was a sporting and religious school
and I don't like religious indoctrination.
But it has preserved me from excesses
later on. Let’s put it this way I don’t
know that I’d be quite as tolerant of
people with different views if I had not
seen what happened earlier on. I believe
your views are your own, you stick by
them, you don’t keep them to yourself
but nor do you try to make everyone
else believe them. The good thing about
private schools is that they guard against
uniformity.
“In 1941-42 my father disappeared
during the Japanese occupation of Java
and my brother did not return from an
RAAF mission. This left my mother and
me alone in Australia. She was deter-
mined to give me the education my
brother had at Shore and to do this
she went to work.
“She had a job in the daytime and a
part-time one at night. As a result I
went to school as if I were a rich man’s
son. I didn't like being poor, I was
frightened of it and I resented the pros-
perity of my school friends and their
families. I wanted to fight someone but
there was nothing to fight except school
discipline.
“My mother told me to apply myself
to my studies, that if I was determined
enough I could successfully fight the
world but the first step was to pass my
examinations. So I made a truce with the
school authority and worked like the
devil was behind me. I was very deter-
mined indeed that when I grew up I
would be successful and rich.
“I’m a bit of a maverick. I just don’t
like people who haven’t views of their

own, who take other people’s and regard

From school Barton went to Sydney
University, just across the road from
which is his Sydney office. He liked
university because it gave him the “op-
portunity and the time to criticise and
discuss without having a master breathing
down your neck.”
“University was very stimulating, like
jumping into cold water,” Barton said.
“The notion at school was that you were
a conservative. I still am I suppose, you
know, bathe every day, white shirt, quiet
tie, clean underwear, clean socks and so
on.
“I joined the Liberal Club at the Uni-
versity and in a fairly short time 1 be-
came president. At the time the Govern-
ment was trying' to push through a bill
on dissolution of Communist parties. I
didn’t like it because I didn’t and don’t
believe a Government has the right to do
this, and I made no bones about it. It
caused quite a stir at the time, I became
very unpopular and left. The bill fell
through after a referendum. It’s not a
great comfort to be in the majority but
this time it was.
Register a protest
“Oince then I have not been very inter-
ested in politics. But more often I
think I've voted Liberal than Labor. The
only time I have voted Labor is in protest
against a Liberal policy. Not because
I believe in the Labor policy more, I
just didn’t like the Liberal policy and this
was my way of registering a protest. It’s
usually been against some philanthropic
proposal of the Government. It’s not a
good thing. They try to do too much
for the people.
“A man who has had a tremendous
influence on me is Georges Sorel who
wrote ‘Reflections on Violence’. He was
anti-authoritarian, as I am. He did not
believe Governments should have the
power of life and death over citizens and
nor do I. He believed in setting up a
government comprised of groups of in-
terests syndicalism. Because of these
interests they could not take over. Self-
help is better than Government handouts.
“Sorel was an advocate of what we
now call the open society. He distinguish-
ed between what he called the ethic of
the producer and the ethic of the consu-
mer. The producer's ethic was one of in-
dividualism, of creativity, of production.
He took an interest in doing something
that was worthwhile, not just because of
the financial return he would get. The
consumer's ethic was one of consump-
tion, of living for the results of produc-
tion. They think more of leisure than

work, they want a shorter week for
greater pay. The only true ethic was the
producer’s and so it should be. It gives
you a good explanation of why people
do the things they do. Like the man at
Marble Bar, for instance. He slaves away

be easier for him to come to Sydney
where he could get paid more for less
work. But he wants to work at Marble
Bar.

nightmare, or in a different world? He’s
helpless and it is the feeling of helpless-
ness today that is so bad. We are bound
by Governments. We have no choice.”
No father figure
being influenced by books, Gor-
don Barton was also influenced by a
man, the Professor of Philosophy at
Sydney University, the late Professor
John Anderson: “A man for whom I had
great admiration. He was probably the
most remarkable man ever at Sydney
Uni. Most of the senior staff, men in their
sixties, seem to exude the father figure
image. Not so Professor Anderson. He
was a man of great authority, a striking
man. He had a tremendous influence on
everyone at the university; especially on
me. I liked him a great deal and I think
he liked me. He didn’t like being pushed
round and made it obvious. And he was
never one to temporise.
“I think that I would have been the
same if I had not met Anderson, but he
inspired me.”
While at university Barton took on
part-time work. His first job was as a
gardener, then he went to the Ford fac-
tory as a storeman. When he left univer-
sity he began legal work.
“One of my first legal jobs was as a
clerk of the Supreme Court of NSW,” he
said. “1 was associate to Mr Justice Ed-
wards. Then I became senior clerk in a
solicitor's office and in 1950 a partner
and I started IPEC. It was hard work,
very hard. He'd drive the one truck we
had and then I’d drive it. It was a long
road but now we have 100 trucks, not a
great many, but we prefer to sub-contact
I started IPEC because at the time it was
hard to find the jobs which fitted in with
my hours.
“I told my wife I have a child and
eight animals, one cat, six kittens and one
dog—you were seeing me and she said
to be perfectly honest because I’d be
found out if I didn’t tell the truth The
rest of it is that I’m basically lazy, now
that I’ve got to where I am. I don't want
to give the idea that I work until all
hours. So, for the record, I usually don’t
come into the office before 11 and leave
as soon as I can.
“Life is not all work. I have a cata-
maran at Rose Bay and sail in competi-
tions. I prefer sail to power. It’s more
exciting, there’s more of a challenge. My
conscience is quite clear now. It’s been a
therapy talking to you.”
And so back to the Federal Govern-
ment to fight for his air cargo line. IPEC
has built up a substantial business in road
freight with overnight deliveries to most
adjacent capital cities. But Gordon Bar-
ton wants to improve this by using
cargo planes. He says the need is there,
that it’s been proved by a questionnaire
he sent to about 1000 users of his present
service.
Nearly all of the replies confirmed his
feelings that present air cargo services
are inadequate and their service is not
above reproach. “My case is strong, but
with two Government-run airlines it will
take time to get started.”


OVERSEAS
Tshombe’s
“Matata”
The Paras v the Simhas
By EMERY BARCS
With the return of 600 Belgian
paras to Stanleyville to snatch
some 1500 European and Asian
hostages from rebel “Premier” Cristophe
Gbenye’s blood - crazed simbas, the
Congolese situation has completed a full
circle.
For these troops should never have
left the Congo. The Loi Fondamentale
passed by the Belgians in full accord
with the Congolese leaders before in-
dependence on June 30, 1960, provided
for continued co-operation between Bel-
gium and her former colony. Belgium
was supposed to play the part of an
older brother guiding the turbulent
adolescent until he reached not only legal
but de facto maturity. The right to garri-
son Belgian troops in the Congo had
been secured to safeguard Belgian and
Congolese interests.
It is difficult to refute the argument
that the story of the Congo would have
been a much happier one during the
past 4} years if in July, 1960, the
Western powers had stood by Belgium
at the time of the rebellion of the Force
Publique. The Belgians could have dealt
with the “problem” instigated by Patrice
Lumumba's backers further north and
by the Soviet Union. Four years of
United Nations intervention at the cost
of £175 million, plus uncounted deaths
and destruction, has solved nothing. At
the end of last June when the ONUC
operation was terminated and the last
blue-helmets were withdrawn, they left
behind complete chaos.
This is relevant because Prime Mini-
ster Moise Tshombe’s efforts to pull the
Congo out of permanent “matata”— the
Bacongo expression for institutionalised
confusion has now provoked a howl
of abuse in a number of African capitals
as well as in both Communist camps.
Tshombe's crime is that he did not sit
back to wait for African help (which
was peremptorily refused to him when he
urgently sought it last July) and that he
recruited help from the quarters which
were ready to give it. No screams of
“foreign intervention” were heard at the
beginning of this year when Messrs Ken-
yatta of Kenya, Milton Obote of Uganda
and Nyerere of Tanganyika requested
help from Britain to put down rebellions
by their own African defence forces. If
Britain had been stopped from giving
such aid the “congolisation” of East
Africa would probably be in full swing
now.
There is nothing new about the appli-
cation of double or even triple standards
by developing countries. Few of them are
fond of Tshombe whom they regard as
(a) an accomplice in the murder of Pat-
rice Lumumba, (b) a front man of the
Union-Miniere du Haut Katanga, the
Belgian-controlled mining company,
(c) a non-Socialist, and (d) a man be-
sotted with love for the West. As Joseph
Murumbi, Kenya’s delegate to UN,
generously admitted last week, Africans
recognise Tshombe as “the legal head
of the Congolese Government,” but not
to the extent of employing Western mili-
tary volunteers or to ask for Belgian and
American help in a desperate situation.
One may sympathise with the African
leaders’ dislike of Tshombe if one is in-
clined that way. But the fact is that at
present this shrewd, 45 years old Katan-
gese ex-businessman is the best hope for
ending the past 4} years “matata”. Last
June he was cajoled back from his Span-
ish exile, after a forced absence of 12
months from his country, because he
seemed to be the only man likely to
obtain the support of the widest variety
of political (which in the Congo means
tribal or regional) leaders. So far he has
done reasonably well. In about 18 weeks
the National Army, spearheaded by the
small force of whites recruited by
Tshombe has cleared most of the
country from the Communist-supported
rebels who only in August had threatened
Leopoldville itself. He has managed to
keep some order among the volatile
politicians of the capital. And if he
survives physically he may launch the
Congo on the road of reconstruction.
This is the point where the West must
stand its ground against the antics of such
Pan-Africanists as Presidents Nasser,
Benbella and Nkrumah who (if one is
charitable enough to attribute the most
nobly unselfish motives to their moves)
simply cannot see anything good coming
out of increased Western help to the
Congo and against the much more ob-
vious condemnation of Belgium, the US
and the UK by the Communist camp.
For there is simply no alternative to
greatly stepped up Western—and mainly
Belgian aid in the Congo unless one
considers that a largely Red take-over is
one.
Potentially the Congo is one of the
wealthiest African countries. But it is
wealthy only if taken as a whole because
there are considerable parts in this huge
(slightly less than one-third of Australia)
tropical region in the heart of Africa
where economic development can be
achieved only by huge investments for
which there is no capital available now.
The Belgian-Congolese financial agree-
ment earlier this year has made the
Congolese Government the biggest share-
holder in most of the country’s biggest
industrial enterprises. This has been
achieved by the handing over of the
Belgian Government’s portfolio of shares
in Congo companies, valued at more
than £3OO million before independence.
Today, owing to the temporary slowing
down —or even complete cessation
of operations by these companies, the
value of the portfolio may be much less.
But with the return of stability the yield
from this huge investment alone would
cover a substantial part of Government
expenses.
The other wholesale massacre
TPhe infrastructure roads, railways,
A harbor facilities, telephone and tele-
graph cables has suffered enormous
damage during the past 4} years. The
jungle has taken over a lot of it. Given,
however, perhaps a year of peace and
good government much of what existed
before could be rescued and new work
could be started. In fact there is no
reason why the Congo should not be able
to recover in an amazingly short time.
Even at the time of the switch-over
from colonial status to independence the
Congo was short of skilled administrators
and intellectuals on all levels. For some
strange reason the rebels have increased
this shortage by the wholesale massacre
of what one would call “white collar
workers” wherever they managed to gain
a foothold. Some observers have sug-
gested that this “liquidation” was under-
taken under Chinese Communist influ-
ence to eliminate “bourgeois elements”.
Be that as it may, the result is that there
are regions where no one above primary
education has survived. And this makes
outside help even more important.

One of the crucial questions is whether
African countries will allow the Congo
the respite necessary for a national re-
covery under Moise Tshombe and under
the terms of Tshombe’s pro-Western
policy or whether they will sabotage his
efforts by helping Communist subver-
sion freely prepared in Brazzaville,
Bujumbura and other places. They can
do a lot one way or another. The task
of the West, however, is clear. It must
do whatever it can to assist the Congo
to full adulthood either with the help of
the rest of Africa or, if this is refused,
against such African resistance.
Soekarno’s
Target
By DENIS WARNER
Dne of Indonesia’s mere persuasive
arguments against Malaysia, stressed
only in private and with great caution by
Soekarno's senior officials, is that since
the Chinese are the biggest racial unit in
the young federation, some day they will
take it over and become a spearhead for
Peking, directly threatening the Indone-
sian archipelago. They point to the
economic dominance of the Chinese in
South-East Asia and to their traditional
political orientation toward their home-
land. Half a century ago Singapore and
Malaya constituted a base and a primary
source of funds for Sun Yat-sen. More
recently, both Singapore and Malaya
were the scene of a Chinese Communist
uprising that took twelve years to con-
trol; and the Clandestine Communist
Organisation in Sarawak, one of the two
Borneo states in the Malaysian Federa-
tion, is almost wholly Chinese.
Of course Indonesians are not the only
people in South-East Asia who worry
about these facts. Fear of Chinese
domination is a motivating force in Prime
Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman’s United
Malays National Organisation, the base
of his Government's Malay-Chinese-
Indian alliance. It was this fear that
kept Singapore out of the Federation of
Malaya when it became independent in
1957 and that resulted in 1963 in the
broader Federation of Malaysia, in which
the Malays hoped that Chinese influence
might be diluted by the presence of other
races.
It might be reasonable to expect, there-
fore, that in its bid to “crush Malaysia”,
Indonesia’s energies would be directed
against the Chinese, especially those
known to be Communists. On the con-
trary, however, from the earliest days of
the aggressive tactics they call “confron-

tation”, the Indonesians have openly
allied themselves with the Clandestine
Communist Organisation. As early as
August, 1963, a month before Malaysia
was formed, the Indonesian military com-
mander at Singkawang in Borneo claimed
that 1600 Sarawakians, mostly Chinese,
whom he was training as guerrillas, would
“soon be ready to return to the north”.
An even more serious situation has
now developed in Malaya itself. There is
a link between the landing of sea-borne
Indonesian guerrillas and paratroopers in
Malaya and the movement of armed
bands of Malayan Communist guerrillas
out of southern Thailand, where they
fled twelve years ago, back into the
jungle vastness of Pahang in central
Malaya. In the name of anti-Commu-
nism, the Indonesian armed forces have
entered into an alliance of convenience
with the Malayan Communist Party to
foment a new Chinese Communist up-
rising in Malaya itself, and alternatively
to attack the fragile Sino-Malay racial
partnership on which Malaysia is based.
Once again we are forcibly reminded
that the war in South-East Asia is one
war with many fronts.
Eleven years ago in the shabby little
town of Betong in southern Thailand, I
discovered that the Communist guerrilla
leader, Chin Peng, had moved in with a
couple of hundred of his followers. Now
Betong is a primarily Chinese town in a
largely Malay province that the Thais
administer with a token police force.
Left to themselves, the Communists set
out their training camps in the surround-
ing jungle, planted vegetable gardens, and
built simple houses. They were prepared
to live and let live, an approach that the
Thais welcomed, especially as their unin-
vited guests were scrupulous about paying
for their food and other needs.
Time and again Kuala Lumpur, first
under the British and subsequently under
the independent leadership of Tunku
Abdul Rahman, appealed for a co-
operative effort by the two countries to
eradicate this little enclave. The Thais
balked at joint military action but in
1959 agreed to combine border-police
patrols. For some reason, the agreement
was never implemented. Unmolested,
Chin Peng went about the reconstruction
of the Communist Party and its armed
units, and subversion of the four southern
provinces of Thailand. For the past
year he has campaigned against Malaysia,
promising the Malays in Thailand that
they will be reunited with Malaya after
“British Malaysia” has been crushed.
Communist medical detachments won
friends by treating villages free of charge.
Others participated in a rural aid pro-
gramme.
More recently Malaysia and Thailand
have agreed to co-operate in eliminating
these Communist forces, now grown to
an estimated five hundred men. But the
agreement is years late. In July and
August the Communist insurgents began
to return to Malaya in groups of about
fifteen, heading for the mountains of
Pahang.
Brief but intensive training
Tndonesia’s links with the Malayan
Communist Party and its sympathisers
date back to December, 1961, when Pre-
sident Soekarno appealed for volunteers
for the West New Guinea campaign. The
Indonesian consulate in Singapore orga-
nised special indoctrination classes, and
handpicked groups, both Chinese and
Malay, were sent to Indonesia for further
political indoctrination and military
training. All of this was quite overt.
Members of the Singapore Government
even went to the airport to bid farewell
to the departing volunteers, though the
police warned that most had Communist
associations.
The recruitment of volunteers in
Singapore and Malaya was resumed early

they were given brief but intensive train-

125 Flinders Lane, Melbourne
A Keith Courtenay keeps its crisp new look longer than any other suit
hinterland, where they expected to re-
ceive a warm welcome from the local
Chinese population and to link up with
the Malayan Communist groups return-
ing from Thailand to form a main base
in Pahang.
Malaya under the British was, of
course, a showcase of how to eradicate
Communist guerrillas. One of the lega-
cies of those years of struggle is a first-
class rural intelligence network. Fisher-
men quickly reported the coastal land-
ings, and around the village of Labis in
central Johore, once notorious for its
armed Communist gangs, the local popu-
lation fell over itself to collect rewards
for information leading to the capture of
the paratroopers and their local agents.
Within a month the original force of
about ninety paratroopers had been re-
duced to twelve. One starving Indone-
sian officer, hearing the sounds of a
party in a Chinese peasant cottage,
knocked at the door and asked for food.
Since the party was being celebrated on
the proceeds of a reward already received
for turning in one of his own men, the
officer was more than welcome. While
the host plied him with food and drink,
one of the guests slipped off to alert the
Gurkhas —and to claim the reward that
would provide yet another party.
An immediate giveaway
TV/liscalculation, misfortune, and inef-
ficiency were all contributing factors
in the Indonesians’ failure. One Hercules
transport with its full complement of
paratroopers is believed to have crashed
into the Strait of Malacca. Paratroopers
who reached their destination landed in
camouflaged uniforms and carried suits
of civilian clothing to help them mix un-
noticed with the local population. Like
the three hundred Malaysian dollars in
crisp single bills each carried, the new-
ness of the suits was an immediate give-
away.
Although the paratroopers’ equip-
ment was good, their training and morale
did not impress the Gurkhas who were
brought in to round them up. Every
man had a compass, but only about one
in ten knew how to use it. Instead of
making a quick rendezvous after the
drop, the paratroopers found themselves
scattered over a wide area. Setting off
in different directions, they soon got lost.
They carried rations for only eighteen
meals and failed to find a ton of food
dropped for their use. Instead of join-
ing up with the sea-borne guerrillas or
with the Malayan Communist groups,
they wandered aimlessly until they sur-
rendered from hunger or were captured
or killed.
It seems certain that Britain, commit-
ted by treaty to Malaysia’s defence and
with investments in Malaya worth more
than $2 billion, will strike back again

against Indonesia itself if there is any
repetition of the landings. The Indo-
nesian guerrilla activities in Sabah and
Sarawak are regarded by the British with
a degree of tolerance that is noticeably
absent in Malaya. Whatever its charges
against the inclusion of the Borneo ter-
ritories in Malaysia, it is argued, Indo-
nesia signed a treaty of friendship with
Malaya in 1959, and its armed attacks
on Malayan territory can only be re-
garded as overt aggression. The agree-
ment is that since Britain and Malaysia
lack the ground forces with which to
meet Indonesia on its own terms, they
should hit back by air and sea, elements
in which the Indonesians, though super-
ficially strong with their MIG-2 Is, Bad-
ger bombers, and missile - carrying
destroyers, are technically weak. The
British believe that they have the means
to destroy Indonesian air and sea power
in two weeks or less, and the Service
chiefs are openly anxious to put their
belief to the test.
A primary restraining influence has
been the Australian view that though
it may prove to be unavoidable, a largely
white man’s war against Indonesia would
damage Malaysia’s Afro-Asian standing
and give support to Indonesia’s claim that
Malaysia is neo-colonialist. This has
occasioned some largely private but
sharply expressed Anglo-Australian differ-
ences, and in British circles here the
charge is frequently heard that Australia
is dragging its feet in honoring its own
commitment to defend Malaysia. Aus-
tralia, committed to advise and consult
with the United States because of its
ANZUS links, is inclined to feel that
British impetuosity is more than balanced
by Washington’s excessive consideration
for Soekarno and his sensitivities. The
differences appear to be mostly in empha-
sis, however: Britain has developed a
hearty detestation for Soekarno; Austra-
lia wants to find a way short of war to
curb Soekarno's expansionist ambitions
before they include eastern New Guinea;
the US, aware that Indonesia must be
considered an integral part of the whole
problem of South-East Asia, wants to do
nothing that will push Soekarno com-
pletely into the Communist camp.
The difficult objective, as in Vietnam,
is to use the persuasive force of military
power as a deterrent without becoming
involved in a war. The difference be-
tween North Vietnam and Indonesia,
however, is that Soekarno seems more
responsive to the threat of retaliatory
action than does Ho Chi Minh. There
was a perceptible, if only temporary,
pulling back in Djakarta in September
when it became obvious that the Malayan
operations had not only failed but also
precipitated a show of British strength.
There is still much that Soekarno can
do to wreck Malaysia without pushing
confrontation to the point where the
British will go to war. The Federation,
which was a year old on September 16,
is racked with stresses and strains. Some
are so serious that they might already
have caused Malaysia to fall apart had
not Indonesia launched a campaign to
crush it.
Actively wooed by Peking
Malaysia was a compro-
mise and an attempt to tidy up the
British colonial residue in South-East
Asia. Sabah and Sarawak were not nearly
ready or large enough to stand on their
own feet. Singapore, excluded from the
Federation of Malaya in 1957 because it
would have given the Chinese a numerical
advantage in the country, needed an out-
let for the energy of its rapidly increasing
Chinese population, which was being
actively wooed by Peking. Torn between
his fear of Singapore’s Chinese and his
even greater fear that the island might
become Communist, Rahman was finally
persuaded that the People's Action Party,
under the leadership of the able and
astute Lee Kuan Yew, had won the
battle against the Communists and that
Malaysia could now care for Singapore's
economic needs while curbing its political
excesses.
There was no other reason in Kuala
Lumpur for including Singapore or the
Borneo territories in a new federation.
Under its own steam, Malaya was doing
even better than the most optimistic had
expected. With a population of less than
eight million, its gross national product
had reached about $2.3 billion a year.
Production of natural rubber, the coun-
try’s principal economic prop, had risen
steadily, and the value of tin and iron-
ore exports was also up. Private car
ownership may not be the best guide to
living standards, but it was symptomatic
of the general prosperity that car regi-
stration jumped from 69,000 in 1957 to
124,000 in 1963. This wealth was not


equally distributed among the races.
Nearly three-fifths of private incomes
went to the 2,700,000 Chinese and only
slightly more than one-fifth to the
3,700,000 Malays; but the Malays com-
pensated for economic inferiority by
wielding the political power.
Even before the Malaysian agreement
was signed, however, Singapore and
Kuala Lumpur had come into bitter con-
flict. Rahman and his fellow Malay
leaders hoped that by restricting Singa-
pore’s representation in the Federal parli-
ament to fifteen seats (Malaya has 104,
Sarawak twenty-four, and Sabah sixteen)
in exchange for various economic and
other internal advantages, they could con-
fine the ambitious Lee Kuan Yew’s poli-
ticking to Singapore. This was a serious
error, and both the United Malays
National Organisation and the Malayan
Chinese Association, the conservative
Chinese communal group in the Alliance
troika, reacted angrily when Lee an-
nounced his intention to contest the
Malayan elections with his predominantly
Chinese but multiracial Leftist People’s
Action Party. Much to everyone’s sur-
prise, Lee’s candidates, though they ran
in nine constituencies, won only one.
This rebuff to Lee did nothing to re-
lieve Kuala Lumpur’s suspicions, which
had already been inflamed when Malay
candidates of the People’s Action Party
defeated United Malays National Orga-
nisation candidates in the three Malay
constituencies in the Singapore elections
the previous fall. As Kuala Lumpur saw
it, the PAP threatened not only the
Alliance’s hold over the Chinese but also
over the Malays.
Excited by rabble rousers
Tn an effort to regain the loyalties of the
A Singapore Malays, UMNO followed
its electoral losses with a Singapore cam-
paign in which Lee and the PAP were
unjustly accused of oppressing the Malays
and of trying to destroy their religion
and culture. This was an open attempt
to stir up dormant animosities between
the two races, which have lived side by
side for many years but have seldom
intermarried.
Excited by rabble rousers from the
UMNO, including its secretary-general
Dato Syed Jaafar Albar, the Malays last
July fell on Chinese bystanders during
a religious procession in the streets and
precipitated the worst racial riots in
Singapore’s history. While more respon-
sible political leaders in Kuala Lumpur
and Singapore tried to calm the now
thoroughly inflamed racial passions,
Djakarta saw a chance that was too good
to miss. A second wave of riots in Sep-
tember was Indonesian-directed. The
result has been a tragic loss of confidence
throughout Singapore and Malaya. Tens
of thousands of Chinese and Malays may
not be living in hate, but they are cer-
tainly living in fear.
In Singapore especially, these tensions
have been exacerbated by the effects of
Indonesia’s “confrontation”. Since July
there has been a sharp drop in all trade
and other economic activity and a sub-
stantial increase in unemployment. To
an appreciable extent the unity that con-
frontation had induced has been broken
by racial suspicions and doubts, in-
advisedly, Kuala Lumpur is pushing
Malayisation and stressing the use of
Malay as the national language. Groups
of Malay youths have taken to daubing
and eradicating English signs and street
names, and the Government is apparently
determined, despite Chinese and Indian
opposition, to make Malay the official
language by 1967.
All of this has contributed to a feeling
among many non-Malays that the official
concept of Malaysia is that it is for the
Malays. “They don't even seem to
want us to join in the fight against Indo-
nesian confrontation,” said a Eurasian.
“Consciously or not, the Malays appear
determined to regard themselves as the
chosen people.” This feeling is prevalent
not only in Malaya and Singapore but
also in Sabah and Sarawak, where the
arrival of Malay Government officials to
take over Federal jobs aroused wide-
spread resentment.
A two-year political truce between
Kuala Lumpur and Singapore has taken
some of the heat out of the internal
situation. It is nevertheless far from
certain that the moderate and genial
Rahman will be able to restrain UMNO
hotheads from carrying on their inflam-
matory propaganda, or that Lee Kuan
Yew will be able to temper his political
ambitions, especially if the economic
situation in Singapore continues to
deteriorate.
British attempts to persuade Kuala
Lumpur to form a coalition government
in the face of Indonesian threats and to
include Lee in a senior Cabinet position,
preferably as Foreign Minister, have been
indignantly rebuffed. Thus, while the
dangers of disunity are recognised, no
one seems willing to make the real com-
promise that the situation demands. Un-
less and until that compromise is effected,
the disunited Federation of Malaysia will
remain a tmpting target for Soekarno.

Saigon: What Is to Be Done
’UU’hat can the United States do in
” South Vietnam? The partial
answer, which is the only answer that
can be offered, is almost as unpleasant
as the circumstances themselves.
Recognising that our vital interests
are at stake, we must act in a manner
abhorrent to American instincts and
exercise greater and more direct con-
trol over both political and military
affairs in Vietnam. We must recon-
cile ourselves to fighting a war of
containment against the guerrillas,
though it will take at least five years
before their resolution even begins to
weaken. We must cut the supply lines
from North Vietnam to South Viet-
nam by bombing the key communica-
tion centres in Laos —and, if neces-
sary, use ground troops to block the
columns of reinforcements and equip-
ment that flow through the country.
We must force Cambodia to close its
borders to Communist units. Finally,
we must use counter-guerrilla forces
in North Vietnam to weaken Ho Chi
Minh’s hold and reduce his ability to
harass the South. We must, in short,
openly commit our forces as deeply
as our vital interests are already com-
mitted in South Vietnam.
Above all, we need to recognise
that we may never win a clear-cut
victory in South Vietnam and that,
in any event, results will be painfully
slow and distressingly meagre. But we
must not yield to the Communist
campaign which seeks to convince us
that we cannot defend South Vietnam.
The conflict in that country has, in a
most direct sense, become a con-
frontation between Peking and Wash-
ington, despite the fact that both fight
through proxies. Since there is no
way for us to withdraw without
abandoning essential interests, we
must remain. Sacrifice is, after all,
the price of greatness, and the quality
of a nation is not assessed in terms
of deepfreezers, computers, and tele
vision spectaculars.
It is curious that the Communists,
who have so little to offer, are so
stubborn in pushing their wares and
so adroit in their propaganda. On the
other hand, the United States, with so
much to offer, is sadly inept in Asia.
Perhaps it is because they care deeply
and we do not. Perhaps it is because
they know exactly what they want and
we do not. Unfortunately, history has
little time for nations that do not
know their own purposes.

In the Wake of the Antipodeans
Three generations of painters , but no relationship
By BILL HANNAN
IN painting as in many other things
Melbourne and Sydney have long
been the chief and more or less equal
centres of activity. For a while, some
five years ago, the two cities were com-
monly held to be artistically opposed,
with Melbourne the centre of figurative,
Australianist painting and Sydney a hot-
bed of International Abstraction. That
was when the most celebrated names in
Melbourne painting were Sidney Nolan,
Arthur Boyd, Albert Tucker, Charles
Blackman, John Brack, John Perceval,
Clifton Pugh—the days of the Anti-
podean Manifesto of revered memory.
This civic identity was very short-lived.
No Melbourne School was established
against which we might contrast more
recent developments. Indeed, as soon as
the tension of the Abstract-Figurative
argument slackened (which it did
quickly) it was apparent that these fig-
urative painters did not have so much in
common, anyway. The Australianist ele-
ment in particular, so strong and engag-
ing in Nolan, Boyd and Tucker, has not
passed on in any recognisable form to the
next generation.
There is in fact no obvious way of
characterising Melbourne painting, or for
that matter Australian painting. One
must look at individual painters or small-
ish groups. In recent years international
styles have sprung up and changed with
extraordinary speed. Australian painters
have spent a good deal of their energy
just keeping up with these changes.
Simple material facts like the great in-
crease in travel opportunities, the steady
rise in buyers’ interest, the expansion of
art publishing, the marked increase in
interstate (and, to some extent, interna-
tional) exhibiting have all contributed
to greater tolerance and eclecticism.
To a considerable degree Australian
painting has always developed in response
to already-established overseas move-
ments. In the case of Nolan, Boyd and
Tucker, who responded variously to
Expressionism and Surrealism, the adap-
tation was most original and of a kind
which gave their painting a marked
regional character. Later styles which
have found favor here, especially the
various shades of abstraction, have not
lent themselves so easily to regional
adaptations. It is now mainly through
landscape that the local environment per-
sists in painting.
The city itself has not been a very
fruitful theme for Melbourne painters.
That most exciting period of rebellion,
the ’forties, saw Vassilieff’s and Bergner’s
slum paintings, Nolan’s St Kilda paint-
ings and Tucker’s “Images of Modern
Evil”. From the same period social
realism has persisted among a small
group which exhibits regularly, and
which includes the often distinguished
work of Noel Counihan.
Perhaps the most obviously and con-
sistently urban painter in Melbourne is
John Brack. Although he is not a re-
formative satirist, he does have an eye
for what is bizarre in the common things
of the city, just as in a more boisterous
way the young pop artists and assemblers
have. He has too much sympathy for
people to attack Suburbia wholesale, but
he does paint a fine picture of a desic-
cated suburb. Currently he is painting
trusses, surgical instruments and artifi-
cial limbs—not people but some of the
props they need to keep body and,
maybe, soul together. One might, too,
call many of Michael Shannon’s subjects
urban, but he is plainly more interested
in the patterning of his red and black
grids than he is in the buildings which
inspire them. Yet even this much refer-
ence to the city is rare enough.
4 i
Figure painting
HPhere is, on the other hand, a strong
tradition of figure painting in Mel-
bourne. In spite of their great contribu-
tion to landscape painting, Nolan, Arthur
Boyd and Tucker depend for their essen-
tial meaning on the human figure, either
for its own sake or as a symbol expres-
sive of its environment. Noel Counihan,
too, relies more on the nobility of pathos
of the figure than on its surroundings to
express the breadth of human concern
behind his social realism. The intimately
personal imagery of Charles Blackman
and Joy Hester, and the unrestrained
personal imagery of John Perceval
equally achieve general validity by their
moving use of the human figure. The far
less popular form of figure painting
portraiture has been kept alive by
notable work from John Brack and
Clifton Pugh.
But the landscape was not abandoned
by any means. I suspect that every Aus-
tralian city can number dozens, maybe
scores, of painters not quite sure whether
they are artists or just plain lovers of
nature. Post - Impressionist landscape
painting, dating in spirit from the ’thirties,
is still very common and, indeed, for the
most part agreeable to look at. Painters
themselves, good or indifferent, have a
predilection for the bush suburbs near
the fringes of the cities.
No Melbourne painter has applied the
formal lessons of abstraction better to
landscape than has Fred Williams. He is
a careful and polished craftsman, whose
gradual abstracting of form from land-
scape builds up clearly developed and
exciting series of paintings. In many
ways he typifies the impact which ab-
straction has had on much Melbourne
painting. In fact, we have seen very few
painters persist with pure abstraction but
we have seen a considerable number
swing between fairly explicit and highly
abstracted landscape painting. Clifton
Pugh provided a recent example for
some years in his landscape and figure
painting, apparently uninterested in for-
malism, he found in a series of seashore
paintings an unaccustomed tendency to
abstraction. By contrast David Keys, a
fairly new but not young painter, has
worked from severely simplified natural
forms towards an ever greater degree of
abstraction. Similarly in several others,
like Robert Grieve, David Newbury or
Arch Cuthbertson, a preoccupation with
formal problems is complemented and
tempered by constant returns to nature.
This same tendency to avoid pure
or total abstraction is common to the
majority of Melbourne’s “non-figurative”
painters, an important group who stood
for some time in opposition to myth-
minded figurative painting. Thus the
terms that can be applied to their paint-
ing are very slippery ones. Roger Kemp,
Leonard French, Donald Laycock,
George Johnson, Leonard Crawford,
Dawn Sime, Erica McGilchrist are not
easily grouped, except on the grounds
of their shared heritage of formalist or
abstract influences.
Roger Kemp is the senior painter
among them. Unlike some experimenters
he has not had much recent success to
compensate for his early years of isola-
tion, although he has earned undoubted
respect. His painting, which in its begin-
nings had some similarity with Futurism,
attempts to discover visual equivalents
for spiritual perceptions, and hence gives
great importance to formal structure
rather than to symbols.
Leonard French, perhaps the best
known of the generation which matured
in the late ’fifties, was one of Kemp’s
closest admirers in his early years. Al-
though French is predominantly a pro-
grammatic painter, it must be remem-
bered that his artistic origins are strongly

Cubist stemming especially from
Leger and Delaunay and hence that
much of his painting is more formal
than symbolic. He has recently, for in-
stance, made much use of an image of a
turtle, which is not a powerful symbol
of anything in particular, but rather more
obviously just a circular living shape.
French is often described as something
of an isolate in Australian painting. There
is admittedly only one painter Jan
Senbergs who shows much of his in-
fluence; nonetheless he does share with
Melbourne painters some marked, com-
mon tendencies. The influences he has
absorbed are those of a well-established
overseas movement. He clearly prefers
images to formal or informal abstraction.
The local scene does not greatly interest
him.
When one looks at an exhibition like
“Recent Australian Painting” one is
struck immediately by the enormous in-
fluence informal abstraction or Abstract
Expressionism has had on Australian
painting. Few of these huge and violent
paintings, however, come from Mel-
bourne. (In fact, in such omnibus exhi-
bitions, few paintings of any sort come
from Melbourne, compared with the
Sydney output.) Abstract painting in Mel-
bourne has been a cooler, more refined
pursuit.
Full acceptance
very broad categories one must use
to describe successive generations
mask, of course, considerable and im-
portant diversity. Nonetheless they do re-
flect the flow of stylistic and ideological
influence. The two generations I have
mentioned so far the Figurative and
less figurative, Humanist and formal, still
contribute the greater part of local ex-
hibitions in the serious galleries, and
dominate the State Gallery’s contempor-
ary collection. The oldest generation
Nolan, Tucker, Boyd and others are
enjoying full acceptance. Their succes-
sors, apart from Fred Williams and Len
French, have been less successful, in
spite of the fact that new painting these
days is very quickly acknowledged. Un-
fortunately their work so far, for all its
competence and honesty, has not been
commanding.
Now the pace of a younger generation
still is quickening. We have recently seen
several one-man and group exhibitions of
painters in their twenties who look like
being important in the near future.
The human figure is once again a
central subject, especially in the work of
Robert Rooney, Gareth Sansom and
George Baldessin. Rooney and Sansom
have developed the sort of wry mannered
horror which is so strong in Francis
Bacon. Their pale figures are flung into
grotesque postures, deprived of all dig-
nity.
George Baldessin seems most likely to
make sculpture his principal medium
though he also paints, draws and prints
well. His graceless, contorted figures ex-
press great vitality and an uncertain dig-
nity. His drawing and prints, like his
sculpture, reveal the same absorption with
the vulnerable strength of man and his
body.
Jan Senbergs, though no older than
several grouped here as young painters,
is already a seasoned exhibitor. He has
in the past worked closely with Len
French, and shares his love for cubist
forms and imposing themes. He stands
therefore clearly apart from his con-
temporaries, and has indeed been obliged
to make his own way without the secu-
rity of belonging to any advance guard.
Senbergs is a somewhat rare case of a
painter in his mid-twenties who has held
several successful one-man shows. Most
wait longer. Bob Haberfield quite recent-
ly exhibited his surrealistic images of
blood and inner organs for the first time
alone. Some exhibit in small groups, like
Graeme Cohen, Winston Thomas and
Richard Havyatt, who showed a mixture
of geometric abstraction and some figure
work, akin once again to the horror
school. Others appear in impressive num-
bers but with disconcerting irregularity
in large shows like the Museum of Mod-
ern Art’s “Young Minds”.
So three generations of painters cur-
rently stock the Melbourne galleries.
Older painters, like William Frater and
George Bell, make welcome occasional
appearances, but the majority of active
Melbourne painters have risen in the
last two decades. Public interest in their
work, in Melbourne, as elsewhere, has
multiplied prodigiously in quite recent
years. About a dozen galleries exhibit
regularly and at peak periods there can
be up to five or six new shows opening in
a week.
This flourishing of galleries and quick-
ening of public interest can, however, be
misleading. The interest in fact is in
national painting, and a large proportion
of exhibitions at the leading galleries
come from interstate or from Australian
painters overseas. The past few years in
Melbourne have been lean ones for new
work, and it is only very recently that the
few promising newcomers have an-
nounced themselves. Actually it is in
sculpture that Melbourne can claim some
pre-eminence. Its painters have been run-
ning a clear second to Sydney’s for some
time. Perhaps the city itself, dispersed
and suburban, induces a certain slack-
ness. Certainly we could do with another
bout of that rebellious vigor which
launched and sustained previous move-
ments, both figurative and abstract.

Letters to the Editor
Academic Salaries
SIR.—I beg to register an opinion very
different from Professor Armstrong’s, on
the recent rise in salaries for academic
persons (it will be a rise for all, surely,
not just for the senior ones as he sup-
poses—and it Will have to be), in his let-
ter (8., November 21). Against Pro-
fessor Armstrong, I submit that it will
easily be found that what draws and
keeps good university teachers, especially
senior ones, is a complex of many things,
and that of these, decent conditions of
work are only one, while competitive
salaries on the world market is another
and a crucial one. Has anyone really
laid down that libraries and so on can-
not be improved while academic salaries
also rise competitively on the world
market?
Admittedly a man in very bad con-
ditions on a high salary may wish to
shift to very good conditions on a lower
salary; but not all high-bidding countries
offer poor conditions. Professor Arm-
strong may be an exception; most aca-
demics will not respond well to a lag in
salaries in Australia. They will tend to
go off to the USA, to Canada, to Britain,
all countries with strong attractions.
(There will be little tendency for the
exodus from New Zealand to stop, as
long as New Zealand ranks even lower
than Australia in competitive salaries, in
taxation requirements, in restrictions on
personal expenditures and imports, and
so on—though New Zealand is one of
the pleasantest places on earth, I should
readily grant.)
Once more against my friend Profes-
sor Armstrong, I suggest that his prin-
ciple of only small increases to senior
persons—to those “least in need” as he
calls them—would be disastrous. I know
of a number of Australians in my own
field who have migrated to North
America primarily for more adequate
salaries and pensions—and they would
all, as senior figures, regard Armstrong’s
principle as ruinous to Australia —as I
think Armstrong can easily verify for
himself. Actually, North American pro-
fessors at present receive nearly double
what Australians receive, in salaries and
pensions, whether measured in terms
of purchasing power under existing tax
structures or in terms of formal rate of
exchange.
Throughout, I think a survey of re-
levant and informed persons will show
the Eggleston recommendations to be
not misguided, but correct and even con-
servative, granted the overwhelming
majority of personal needs and tastes.

The Call-Up
SIR. —While Plain English—“ Beyond
the Wit of Australians?” (8., Novem-
ber 14) contains much to com-
mend, its contention that “The real rea-
son for military hostility to national ser-
vice seems to be a mixture of plain
conservatism and professional pride” lays
the article open to a counter-charge of
thinking in terms of World Wars I and
11. It is not professional pride that makes
the RAN and the RAAF reject NS train-
ing, but the inescapable fact that such
training cannot provide the technicians
which this age demands for navies and
air forces.
The whole tone of the article seems to
think in terms of soldiers and more
soldiers, with presumably Allied Navies
and Air Forces to fetch and carry for
us as in the two world wars. Quite
apart from the fact that Australia has
not the man-power to become involved
in protracted land campaigns, particu-
larly of a guerrilla nature, we seem to
be breeding a nation of ostriches which
refuses to recognise the obvious fact that
Australian armies, large or small, cannot
operate outside Australia in the face of
serious enemy opposition without ade-
quate naval sea and air power.

the main arguments against execution”.
It is not one of the most cogent. For
those of us not already brutalised by our
complicity in the mass killing of the
innocent are unlikely to be much affected
by the individual elimination of the
guilty. (2) If it could be proved that the
death penalty were an effective general
deterrent from murder, then we would
have to choose between preserving the
lives of convicted murderers and protect-
ing those of future victims. Choice of
the latter alternative would not commit
anyone to support for the introduction
of the death penalty (or the lash) for
lesser crimes. (3) Alwyn Karpin’s em-
phasis on the ghastliness of a particular
hanging is no less emotive than J. Edgar
Hoover’s stress on the bestiality of some

Angry Young Painter
SIR.—I feel that the re-emergence of
Andrew Sibley into the bright sunlight
of the art world is a great event for us.
His admirers are legion and his eclipse
distressed them. But now he is back
with his hair grown again; the angry
young man of Australian art. Judging
by the interview (8., November 7),
his sojourn in the shadows has made
him sharper than ever. Great things can
be expected of Sibley if he continues to
ventilate his spleen instead of consuming
himself with his own bitter fire to pre-
serve the outward show of Mr Nice Guy.
Your interviewer is to be commended for
such a superb word picture of this ex-
ceptionally talented artist.

Peace Congress
SIR. —The Education conference of the
Australian Congress for International Co-
operation and Disarmament, was held on
Saturday, October 24, two days before
any of the other conferences met. I
only knew of two people from Victoria
at all well, so I did not know if the
people on the various committees, and
the people who spoke, were Communists
or not. But as the day wore on, and I
was able to observe the debate, the chair-
men, and the workings of the various
committees, it became apparent that the
conference was rigged, and that it was
very sensitive to discussion critical of
the Soviet Union and its satellites.
In the evening’s discussion group on
“The Cult of Violence” I foreshadowed
a motion, “that as a means of lessening
the cult of violence throughout the world
this conference urges that there should
be free dissemination of pacifist propa-
ganda in the USSR” (where it is pro-

hibited). However, in spite of my fore-
shadowing this, the chairman, the Rev.
P. Saphin, kept the discussion going until
there was no time for me to put my
motion in the discussion group.
At the meeting of the drafting com-
mittee I was in order in trying to have
this motion included in the findings,
since I had spoken to it briefly in fore-
shadowing it. However, it was objected
to in shocked tones as being too specific
and certainly divisive. When I proposed
to change the reference to the USSR to
a reference to all countries it was
grudgingly agreed to append it to the
end of the drafting committee’s motion.
When this motion came up for debate
it was objected to strongly. At last Mr
D. Taylor, who was not at this stage in
the chair, walked to the microphone and
suggested, “free dissemination in all
countries of publicity for International
Co-operation and Disarmament” (wild
applause). At no stage was any amend-
ment formally put, but the chairman
asked if the new wording would be
acceptable to the mover and seconder of
the motion. When I refused, the chair-
man simply asked for a new seconder to
the motion. The motion was passed with
my voice alone dissenting.
Before the final meetings of discussion
groups, and the final meeting of the draft-
ing committee, the members of the draft-
ing committee were each handed a long
type-written motion, which had been
prepared beforehand. The drafting com-
mittee passed this as the general finding
of the conference. One interesting point
about this statement is that although it
was prepared some days beforehand, it
is an accurate summary of many of the
contributions to the discussion.
The tone of the conference was that of
a scaled-down Nuremberg rally. In the
evening we had to listen to an hour and
a half’s emotional and rabble-rousing
speeches. There was an unnerving atmo-
sphere of blind mass emotion present.
And interspersed throughout were such
comments as “if we were in South Viet-
nam I’m sure that everyone in this hall
would be fighting with the Viet Cong”.

AROUND MELBOURNE
Do You Ken Yon Peal?
r I 'he passion that bell-
A ringers get for bell-
ringing is awe-inspiring to
see. They have this inter-
national fraternity of bell-
ringers and when on holi-
days they tour the world ringing bells
hither and yon. To the outsider it is not
easy to see why they do it. Partly, per-
haps, it’s the fellowship, partly a fascina-
tion for the pure mathematical beauty
and precision of bellringing and almost
certainly an insensitivity to prolonged
and large volumes of sound.
But bellringers are like normal human
beings. They are not necessarily inter-
ested in religion. Although, of course,
it makes the Dean very happy if they go
to church. Their real passion is the
bells. Organists go from church to
church looking for good organs and it’s
the same with bellringers. While the
bells were out of action at St Paul's
Cathedral the bellringers kept their hand
in at St Patrick’s.
Melbourne, you must understand, is
a good bells town. St Paul's has a beau-
tiful set of bells, the only 12-bell peal
outside the British Isles. But over the
past 70-odd years the old oak bell frame
has begun to sag, so the bells were
packed off to Messrs J. Taylor of Lough-
borough, England, for retuning and a
new steel frame.
Now the bells are back and the bell-
ringers have just had their celebration,
a full peal. There was no advance pub-
licity and it took place on the Saturday
afternoon.
Graeme Heyes, St Paul's bell captain,
had called together a distinguished inter-
state team: On No. 1 bell, Ken Minchin-
ton, an executive at Myers Melbourne;
on 2, Robin Turen, a lecturer at Monash
University; on 3, Harold McDonald, a
demonstrator at Melbourne University;
on 4, Bill Pitcher, an Adelaide bookseller;
on 5, Hervey Bagot, CSIRO Melbourne;
on 6, Miss Enid Roberts, librarian, Syd-
ney; on 7, Ron Russ, Weapons Research
Establishment, Salisbury, SA; on 8, Tom
Goodyer, chief actuary MLC, Sydney;
on 9, Brian Cox, Adelaide solicitor and
on 10, David Blevy, Adelaide law student.
Graeme Heyes explained that they
would attempt a full peal of the Grand-
sire Caters. That is there would be
5201 changes on 10 bells and on no
occasion would they repeat a change.
It would take at least 33 hours of non-
stop bell ringing. The relevant word was
“attempt”; if anyone made a mistake
and it wasn't corrected within a minute,
under the rules of bellringing they had
to stop and the peal was called off.
I suggested that this must be like
catching a crab in a rowing eight or
dropping a catch in a Test match.
“That's about it,” he said. “Nobody
says anything. You just stop. Every-
body sits down without looking at each
other, practically in tears.”
Other thoughts came to mind. What
would happen during that 33 hours if
someone wanted to go to the lavatory?
“Can't,” he said. “You have to be care-
ful not to drink anything beforehand.
And sometimes weird things happen. If
you're a little paunchy, what with all that
stretching your pants are likely to fall
down. We have one bellringer who has
taken to wearing braces.”
I asked if I could stay in the bell
tower and watch the peal in action. Mr
Heyes said, “No.” That was another
rule. Nobody was allowed to watch the
peal for fear that even the slightest dis-
traction could cause a mistake. During
the entire peal the belltower was locked
and sealed. Nobody was allowed in and
nobody was allowed out.
The conductor, in this case, Tom
Goodyer from Sydney, called the
changes, naming each change like
“Bobbin Single”—then each ringer would
be expected to know what to do.
It was easy to see that this was a
serious occasion. Previous peals were
commemorated with large marble and
wooden plaques on the walls. There had
been peals for Coronations, Royal Visits,
the Centenary of Settlement in Victoria
and for the hanging of the heavy bells
back in 1891.
We went down the
spiral stone staircase and
the little door was locked
behind us. At 1.53 p.m.
the bells crashed out and
the noise in the court-
yard seemed ear - shattering. Graeme
said it wasn't merely a matter of just
pulling a rope. Each time the bells
turned right over. When they rang
they were pointing straight upwards,
making their peal towards heaven. So
precise timing was necessary. “If you
get things wrong, you can go up with the
rope.”
For hour after hour the ringing went
on at the rate of 25 changes a minute
with 10 strikes in each change. There
was no tune, just an infinite variety of
sound. Graeme Heyes said: “You don't
have to be able to read music or any-
thing like that. Here you learn by
numbers, like learning music by a graph.
We do it the way its been done for 300
years. There’s a theory that bellring-
ing has an affinity to old English folk
dancing. The bells move in and out,
just the way dancers do in folk dancing.”
Graeme walked all around the city
listening from various vantage points.
He even sat over the other side of the
river and the sound came in gusts as the
wind blew. At 5 p.m. the Verger re-
ported that the Railways had called up,
tactfully, to ask when it was all going to
stop.
Suddenly at 5.41 p.m. the bells stop-
ped and the silence was overwhelming.
Once again it was possible to hear the
trams in Flinders Street. “They’ve made
it,” said Graeme, “that’s the longest peal
ever recorded at St Paul’s—three hours
48 minutes. There’s only ever been one
longer in Australia, at Yass about 1950.
They rang 8000 changes and went for
about 5i hours.”
The door of the belltower opened and
Graeme held out his hand: “Congratu-
lations.” I suggested they must all be
very tired, but Graeme Heyes said in
England sometimes ringers did a circuit
of churches making four full peals, a
total of 12 hours ringing in one day.
“Bellringing is a disease,” he said.

FILMS
The American Jungle
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
America, America. Director, Elia Kazan.
Palace Theatre, Sydney.
The Big Parade of Comedy. Various
directors. Liberty Theatre, Sydney.
Johnny Cool. Director, William Asher.
Esquire Theatre, Sydney.
Elia Kazan combines an intensely per-
sonal approach to the cinema with a
lively interest in, and grasp of, the actual
mechanics of film making. His films,
whatever their content, are always stimu-
lating to watch; and he is extraordinarily
gifted in his use of his actors, with a
capacity for making them give their best
and a little bit more. Has Marlon Brando
ever appeared to better advantage than
in “Viva Zapata”, “A Streetcar Named
Desire”, “On the Waterfront”? Andy
Griffith than in “A Face in the Crowd”?
Natalie Wood than in “Splendor in the
Grass”?
This may be because Kazan has him-
self been an actor. He appeared briefly
but memorably in “City for Conquest”,
a film probably remembered by nobody
but me.
Kazan’s other recognisable preoccupa-
tions are his detestation of oppression
and his delight in man's instinctive revolt
against it. Kazan shows no political bias,
merely a wonder at the toughness,
obstinacy and resilience that make up
the human spirit.
Even for Kazan, “America, America”
is a very personal film. The story comes
from the experiences of his uncle, a
Greek youth who at the turn of the
century managed to get himself out of
Turkish-dominated Anatolia to America.
To him and his like America is a goal
rather than a place on the map. His
burning desire to reach this Eldorado,
realised after years of struggle, turns him
from a dreamy youth into a man pre-
pared to endure anything, do anything,
just to get there. He learns the hard way
that one must fight a brutal society with
brutality. He’s beaten, robbed, starved
and overworked, commits murder and
becomes a “boy whore” but at last he’s
in America, for better or worse.
Kazan gives us the story of the true
refugee-migrant, who must perforce seek
new horizons, not just for novelty. The
film is too long—(it's obviously so close
to Kazan's heart that he couldn't throw
away a foot of it) —but it's a remarkable
achievement, with a surge of genuine
emotion. The photography has a sad,
lyrical beauty, and again Kazan has
picked (and trained) a winner in the
young actor Stathis Giallelis, who with
the director’s help makes the anti-hero
comprehensible, engaging and in the last
analysis heroic.
A combination of nostalgia and frus-
tration, “The Big Parade of Comedy”
gives bits from the films you’d love to
see again and the others you’ve never
seen. From the latter there’s a tantalising
sequence from George Cukor’s “Two
Faced Woman”, with Garbo at her
magical best and a breathtaking bit of
camerawork in Melvyn Douglas’ fall
down a snow-sloue
The film’s often annoyingly off-key—
the short clip from “The Philadelphia
Story” is quite uncharacteristic of this
sleek, witty film—but it has much to
offer: Jean Harlow, The Marx Brothers,
Laurel and Hardy, a splendid comedy
sequence in a lift with William Powell
and Gail Patrick —and some marvellous
moments from the Pete Smith shorts
featuring Dave O'Brien, an expert stunt
man who also happened to be a brilliant
pantomime comic.
The American crime thriller, on paper
or celluloid, fascinates the smart French
cinematographers. One of their favorites
was “Johnny Cool”, a competent, cleanly
photographed and thoroughly second-rate
film about a Sicilian bandit sent to Ame-
rica to exterminate the enemies of a
repatriated gangster. Henry Silva is too
busy rushing from one murder to another
to have time for any acting; Elizabeth
Montgomery overacts for the two of
them. Seems to me those “Cahiers du
Cinema” people can make a cult out of
anythin?

Since the original release of this, her
first recording, Joan Baez has become
the high priestess of America’s folk
revival. Her voice is clear, sweet and
autumn-toned, her choice of material
often plaintive. On “Lowlands” and
“Black Is the Color”, she achieves a
haunting effect, but even more appealing
is the lighter “O, What a Beautiful City”.
Harvard graduate Bill Wood joins her
on “So Soon In the Morning”, “Kitty”,
and “Careless Love”; they team well and
his excellent guitar adds strength to the
accompaniment. Two solos by Wood
“John Henry” and “Travellin’ Shoes” —•
owe much to Josh White, which is per-
haps why they are so easy on the ears.
During the past six years, Henry Man-
cini has won thirty-two major awards
for his background music to films and
television shows. With the scoring of 120
films to his credit, it was inevitable that
he would attempt something for the
concert stage. The result was a tour
with a seventy-piece orchestra playing
new arrangements of some of America’s
most enduring popular songs presented
in the form of concert suites. Four of
these suites are recorded to perfection
on “The Concert Sound of Henry Man-
cini”; one which combines seven
Academy Award-winning tunes; two
which pay tribute to Victor Young and
David Rose; and, lastly, a pot-pourri
of his own television scores from “Mr
Lucky” to “Peter Gunn”. It is all a
little rich for my palate.
If you have not yet sampled Frankie
Avalon, the sleeve note’s statement that
“adoring females flip over his lean and
handsome looks, quiet charm and vel-
vety-smooth singing voice and cause near
riots during his personal appearances”
should be warning enough.
On the “Muscle Beach Party” songs
which occupy one side of the record, his
“velvety-smooth singing voice” is merci-
fully under-recorded and he is hindered
rather than helped by a team of squalling
young ladies and the standard twanging
sounds of the present-day pop scene.
The appalling sleeve-notes which ac-
company “New Orleans Nights” foolishly
try to create the impression that this is a
recent Armstrong recording. More was to
be gained than lost by giving accurate in-
formation. Actually, the greater part of
the album was recorded in 1950, not long
after Louis discarded his inhibiting big
band to form the All Stars, a tradition-
ally-instrumented small group which re-
captured the improvisatory freedom of
his earlier Hot Five.
On the evidence of some mediocre
records made with the big band in the
’forties, many consider that the giant
was tottering, that the exciting part of
Armstrong's career was over. The original
release of the selections offered again in
“New Orleans Nights” demonstrated that
the adventurous and creative talent that
had influenced two generations of jazz-
men was not only still alive but intensi-
fied by a technical mastery that was more
astounding than ever.
On such New Orleans standards as
“Panama”, “My Bucket’s Got a Hole in
it” and “Bugle Call Rag”, Louis leads
these distinguished jazzmen with com-
plete authority and, if the highly in-
dividual styles occasionally fail to mesh
in the improvised ensemble passages, the
solos are magnificent. “New Orleans
Function” is a microscopic portrayal of a
Negro funeral: the sedate march to the
graveyard to “Flee As a Bird to the
Mountain” in three-part harmony; the
graveside oration by the Reverend Satch-
mo interspersed with cries from the
mourners as they lower “oT brother
Gate” into the ground; then the joyous
return to town with “Oh, Didn’t He
Ramble!”, beginning in march time and
winding up as a hell-for-leather stomp.
“The Best of the Weavers” is a hand-
somely-packaged, two-record album of
the original performances, of songs in
their repertoire which have made the
greatest impact during their sixteen years
together. The current interest, now reach-
ing its peak in Australia, will make it a
welcome collection.
Pete Seeger, who resigned in 1958 to
pursue his own burgeoning solo career, is
present on most tracks and the other
members of the group are Lee Hayes,
Fred Hellerman and Miss Ronnie Gilbert.
Probably in the belief that it makes them
palatable to a larger audience, most of
their recordings are made with an orches-
tra and, discreet as the backgrounds gen-
erally are, I believe a simple string ac-
companiment would have made for
greater authenticity.

In view of the reputation for authenticity
enjoyed by the New York Pro Musica
ensemble and its director, Noah Green-
berg, it is perhaps unfortunate that the
very item which opens and gives its name
to this musical tribute to Shakespeare
should be sung by the wrong number of
voices, at the wrong speed and to the
accompaniment of the wrong instrument.
At the merry pace at which the Pro
Musica (and most modern singers) take
Morley’s well-known setting, the original
lute accompaniment is just about un-
playable and certainly unintelligible; Pro
Musica takes the wrong way out by trans-
ferring it to harpsichord. The additional
quirk of splitting up the single vocal line
between male and female voices has no
historical justification that I know of.
Greenberg allows enthusiasm to over-
come discretion at a few other points in
what is in the main a richly varied and
enjoyable anthology from the greatest of
all periods of English music. Although
practice was fairly free in Elizabethan

PROBLEM
How to brand a
rubber diving suit
A SELEX DECAL
Elasfical Transfer
You wouldn’t call this an everyday problem. It was a very
real problem to the diving suit manufacturer, until he called
in Selex Decal. He found, to his surprise, that Selex Decal
had lots of experience in branding rubber —devising
transfers for tyres, waders, vee belts, etc. But this material
was different —black neoprene sponge rubber. Undeterred,
the Selex Decal lab. went to work. Without any developmen-
tal cost to the diving suit manufacturer, Selex Decal pro-
duced transfers printed with a colourful trademark design
which would cure into the rubber, s-t-r-e-t-c-h, and remain
impervious to the effects of salt water, scuffing, even soap.

and Jacobean times, I don’t think the
musicians of those days shared Green-
berg's excessive fondness for “broken”
consorts of mixed orders of instruments:
the fine Wilbye fantasia, for example,
played here by a motley collection of
bowed, plucked and blown instruments
sounds much richer and more expressive
played by a pure consort of violas.
The value of the Pro Musica lies not
so much of in detailed scholarship as in
its ability to bring older music vividly
to life in a form that is at least some-
thing like that in which it might have
been heard at the time it was written.
And in this respect this latest disc suc-
ceeds as well as any of their preceding
issues.
The playing and singing throughout
sounds joyous and spontaneous, and tech-
nically it is almost uniformly sweet and
secure. The choice of examples is repre-
sentative, but wide - ranging, including
such rarely heard items as a pair of bass
viola solos by Captain Tobias Hume, one
time mercenary to the King of Sweden.
In the case of the other record of
English music under review there can
at least be no arguments about authen-
ticity. Benjamin Britten (who, with Pur-
cell, is arguably one of the two most
important English composers since Jaco-
bean times) is a first-class conductor, and
he has here the co-operation of first-class
musicians in interpreting his own music.
Those with memories of Peter Pears’
first recording of the “Serenade'’ around
two decades ago will find that the years
have thickened his tone a good deal and
robbed it of some of its bright flexibility;
but his feeling for the mood of the half-
dozen songs that make up this varied and
beautiful cycle is as intelligently respon-
sive as ever.
Barry Tuckwell, the Australian-born
horn-player, seems no less capable than
the late Dennis Brain, for whom the
obbligato part was originally written; and
if memory serves his playing is more
pungent and assertive than Brain’s.
Britten's “Young Person's Guide to
the Orchestra'’ (Variations and Fugue on
a Theme of Purcell) was written in 1946
for the purposes of an instructional film
in a deliberately traditional style. That
it should have survived to become one of
Britten's most popular works, and one
which retains its vitality and appeal after
numerous hearings, attests as firmly to
his extraordinary gifts as some of his
much more ambitious works.
Many composers have “written down”
to unsophisticated audiences for special
purposes and have imitated past styles,
but it is hard to think of any that have
done so and still retained intact their
normal originality and creative force, as
Britten has certainly done here. (Even
the “quiet spots” which originally served
to accommodate the spoken commentary


sound dramatically and formally “right”
in the pure orchestral version.) The work
has had many recordings; this new one is
the best I know of.

TELEVISION
Sydney v. Melbourne
Project 64: The Rivals. Channel 9, Sydney.
Producer Bob Raymond, who seemed
overawed by his assignment on Britain
today and tomorrow, is happily relaxed
again in “The Rivals”, a light-hearted
survey of the supposed hostility between
Sydney and Melbourne.
Raymond's documentary made it clear
that the notorious rivalry is nothing more
than the natural proprietorial preference
for the place where you happen to live.
But, in the closing words of the pro-
gramme, “there's not much point in being
rivals on a melting iceberg”.
Starting from this cheerfully cynical
assumption, the documentary, skilfully
cutting back and forth from one capital
to the other, managed to demonstrate
that we're really very much the same silly
people. If we laugh at Prince’s Bridge,
the people from Melbourne have only to
mention the Opera House; the confusion
and ugliness of Sydney’s town-planning
can be countered by the information that
Melbourne has more murders per year
than Hong Kong.
Interviewers Alan Barnes (from Syd-
ney in Melbourne) and Kevin Sanders
(from Melbourne in Sydney) entered
admirably into the programme’s spirit of
skittish levity, and managed without be-
ing ill-mannered to show up much of our
solemn foolishness. There was Sydney’s
Lord Mayor Jensen, lolling comfortably
in a chauffeur-driven car as he spoke of
proposed reforms in public transport; and
the Melbourne manufacturer of meat
pies (“a snack and indeed a meal”) who
admitted that Sydney pies were quite
nice, but “I think we have the edge on
Sydney as far as pies are concerned”.

BOOKS
When the Racket Had to Stop
By PETER COLEMAN
The Lucky Country. Donald Horne. Pen-
guin. Bs. 6d.
There are many Donald Hornes in this
engrossing new book on the State of
Australia Question. There is Horne the
Prophet of Doom and Horne the Man of
Confidence; Horne the Puritanical Cen-
sor and Horne the Hedonistic Pagan;
Horne the Journalist, Horne the Tub-
Thumper, Horne the Patriot, and even,
unexpectedly, Horne the Poet of the
People. But what keeps it and its various
moods together is a crisp, epigrammatic
examination of the gravest Australian
problem the gulf between the obvious
threat to the survival of the way of life
Australians wouldn’t swop for any on
earth, and our easy indifference to what
has to be done to preserve it.
It begins with what, I suppose, is
Horne the Prophet: “Everywhere one
goes in Australia among sensitive, intelli-
gent people of the middle generation
once the conversation reaches a certain
depth—one meets a sense of desperation:
What is going to happen next? Those
who love their country, or (in the more
restrained Australian idiom) are worried
about the life their children will lead, or
are simply wondering what is going to
happen next . . . none of these can imag-
ine the future. Among those who are
frightened by a perpetual state of Stand
Easy and it is an emotion breaking
through political party loyalties there
is a feeling of distrust for their own
nation; a fear that responsible, clever
people will just not be found; that there
will be no breakthrough of new men;
things will just go on; no one will do the
job.”
This sense of catastrophe is the theme
of the book. It starts with it, and keeps
coming back to it. In fact, one of Horne’s
reasons for writing the book has been
to set down, for the benefit of future
readers, his idea of “what the huge conti-
nent was like in those early days of the
19605” before the catastrophe happened,
and the Australian way of life was un-
recognisably transformed.
It does this much better than most of
the Australian surveys churned out in
recent years because Horne works out-
wards from what he does so well the
exploration of Australian manners. Some
examples will show the sort of thing.
(This is Donald Horne the Moralist.)
Here is the Australian attitude to “rat-
baggery”:
Faced with odd conduct, Australians
ask: “What’s in it for him?” Such a
view of life can strip calculating self-
interest of its fancy clothes; but it does
not allow for the irrational, the ele-
ment of craziness that may be a more
important element in affairs than
rationality. Themselves calculating,
materialist and optimistic, Australians
find it hard to accept that quixotry,
pessimism, spirituality, desire for de-
feat, boredom, love of rhetoric or of
risk, of wielding power for its own
sake all ratbaggery these may
often impel action. In the narrow shaft
of clear, bright sunlight, where Aus-
tralians think, there is little room for
the view in which we all just seem to
bump around in the shadows with little
understanding of what it is all about.
Australians think they have life
taped . . .
Or the limitations of Australian friend-
liness:
Since Australian friendliness often
lacks knowledge of social forms and
ceremonies, it can sometimes
seem so strange as to be taken
for rudeness, usually for the
one reason that most Austra-
lians are bereft of feelings of
difference; they think that all
people are the same, that what
is good for oneself is good for
anyone else. Their openness
and friendship - seeking is
based on this belief. They seek simi-
larity where often it does not exist
even among themselves. They reach
out for the essential humanity of man
but the apparatus with which they do
it is too primitive for the task. They
retreat into suspicions . . .
Or the Typical Australian:
The image of Australia is of a man
in an open-necked shirt solemnly en-
joying an ice-cream. His kiddy is be-
side him.
But the major theme, according to
Horne, of Australian history and manners
is Luck. (This is Donald Horne the Cen-
sorious Puritan.) Australia is the Lucky
Country. For most of our history, beyond
the early heroic period, we have been
lucky rather than deserving, and we have
developed a sort of religious faith in
our luck. The country grew wealthy, not
like other countries say Japan
through enterprise or hard work or religi-
ous fervor, but because we were sitting
on a gold mine, and overseas countries
protected us militarily while other over-
seas countries provided the ideas and in-
ventions which we adapted. Through all
the crises we developed a flair for impro-
visation and our way of life survived
them all more or less intact. But that
lucky chapter is ending. The luck system
despite continued prosperity is run-
ning down and Australians now face two
great facts that we cannot improvise our
way out of; Asia (whose people will
surely migrate here in one form or an-
other in large numbers) and Technology
(which will leave an imitative society
like ours behind). The Racket is over.
The Kissing will Have to Stop.
But having painted the worst, Horne
is not too pessimistic about it or not
for long. There is plenty to be done.
(This is Donald Horne the Revolution-
ary.) The present leaders of the country
must be replaced. (“Racketeers of the
mediocre who have risen to authority in a
non-competitive community where they
are protected in their adaptations of
other people’s ideas . . . Australians’ con-
tempt for those who run their affairs is
more than a mere expression of egalitar-
ianism; it is an accurate assessment”); we
must start encouraging the immigration
of Asian elites; and we must certainly
scrap the monarchy which reinforces
some of the worst traditions in
Australian life and the delusion
that we are safe and sound. (No
one under 35 takes the mon-
archy seriously.)
In the end, perhaps our faith
in our luck may carry us
through the coming revolution.
The true gambler enjoys losing
and Australian laconicism, toler-
ance, courage and adaptability are yet to
be fully exploited. (It is refreshing to
read Donald Horne the Poet of the
People.)
This is the sort of book it is, but an
outline is misleading; it is a book to be
savored for its details the passing
remarks on everything from puritanism
to northern development. Most readers
will find plenty to disagree with (there
is too much of Donald Horne the Village
Tub-Thumper in some chapters; like his
Australians, he thinks he has everything
taped), and some gaps to complain
about (there is no discussion of religion
in Australian life, surely one major in-
gredient in Australian attitudes). But this
is because it raises basic questions, and
because it is by Horne the Journalist —
that is, it is written by a man who is not
afraid to stick his neck out. What Austra-
lia needs, to borrow one of Mr Horne's
favorite phrases is a pamphlet war, and
this long pamphlet may start one off.
With average luck.


Explosive Asia
The Last Confucian. Vietnam, South-East
Asia, and the West. Denis Warner. Angus
and Robertson, 37s. 6d., also Penguin, 8s.
Indonesia Face to Face. Ivan Southall, Lans-
downe Press. 45s.
Those who are familiar with Denis War-
ner’s work as one of the most distin-
guished and thorough reporters of the
South-East Asian scene for the English-
language Press will find much in this
book which they had read before. Yet
“The Last Confucian” is not simply a
reprint of innumerable articles but a
coherent synthesis of years of thought
and experience in one of the world’s most
explosive areas. In the past Mr Warner
had often irritated his readers with his
gloomy predictions. Unfortunately he
was usually right. Does he hold now
any hope for a “Western future” in
South-East Asia?
On South Vietnam he believes that
“nothing presents itself as an easy way
out. Within the scope of the present
American commitment it is possible to
lose the war but not to win it. Eventu-
ally the war must go to the conference
table. Whether a solution can be worked
out there that does not lead to an ulti-
mate Communist victory depends on the
capacity, and the willingness, of the mili-
tary leaders to embark on a serious cam-
paign for the hearts and minds of the
peasants and the Americans to support
them with a much greater effort.”
Mr Warner rightly points out that “by
the assassination of Diem (on November
2, 1963) the coup leaders sowed a harvest
of lawlessness which the country has
only just begun to reap. To have com-
pelled Diem to abdicate might have
opened the way for constitutional changes
and reforms. The moment General Xuan
ordered the assassination, constitutional
methods were forgotten and jungle law
prevailed”. This was written last April.
Since then the law of the jungle has
spread even wider.
The author’s “catalogue of errors” —an
analysis of the mistakes which helped the
Communist take-over in North Vietnam
and the virtual loss of Laos to the Pathet
Lao—should be made compulsory read-
ing for all Australians who still think of
an easy-way-out solution for their coun-
try’s defence problems.
Denis Warner believes that sooner or
later “seeping Communism” will become
strong enough in Thailand to try to start
some serious business in that pro-West
South-East Asian citadel. During the
past 10 years or so the comrades have
built fairly strong organisations in the
neglected north-east of that country.
They had a fairly easy task partly because
the local population are kinsmen of the
Laotians across the Mekong and partly
because the Government in Bangkok had
only nominal power over the region.
The West “discovered” the extent of
Communist spadework in north-east
Thailand only about three years ago.
Since then at least something has been
done to remedy the situation —and not
merely by strengthening the 1000 miles
border along the Mekong. The local
population is being re-converted to Thai
national feeling by providing the area
with schools, hospitals, roads and other
facilities and by opening up new fertile
regions for settlement. Mr Warner says,
however, that all this may be not enough
because “the Communists have such a
start that armed struggle can scarcely
be avoided”. And he may be right again.
Ivan Southall writes about Indonesia
with much sympathy and understanding.
He attributes much of both to the parti-
cipants of the Australian Volunteer Gra-
duate Scheme whose (so far) 41 members
have done valuable work in Indonesia
since 1951. Mr Southall hints that this
—strangely enough—little known and
much too little publicised scheme might
have inspired the creation of the US
Peace Corps. In writing his book the
author has relied to a considerable extent
on the experiences of the young men and
women graduates who have lived not
only among but with Indonesians during
their two or four years stretches in Pre-
sident Soekarno's realm.
Mr Southall shares the dilemma of
most well intentioned Westerners who
want to draw an impartial picture of
some developing country with a colonial
past. They find so much to love and
so much to criticise. They find the con-
tradiction between a friendly and lovable
people which readily responds to sincere
friendliness and the rigidity, corruption
and lazy " inefficiency of the official
machinery puzzling. Usually (and Mr
Southall is no exception) they bend over
backwards to attribute the first to in-
nate goodness and the second to an in-
heritance of and a hangover from colo-
nial days.
This explanation is much too facile.
Colonialism had many faults and it is
good that the colonial days are over. But
this era had also positive achievements
which become rather obvious if one visits
some Asian and African countries which
have never been under a “Western yoke”.
Most Australians who know Indonesians
well will share Mr Southall's warm senti-
ments about a people which can be so
charming and friendly unless artificially
roused to arrogance and hatred. But
after reading “Indonesia Face to Face”
one feels that the sooner Indonesians
forget past grievances inflicted by others
and concentrate on present failings of
their own the sooner they will solve the
problems of their sadly mismanaged
country.
EMERY BARGS
Wanton Brutality
Albert Angelo. B. S. Johnson. Constable
26s.
Three Cheers for Nothing. Peter Kinsley.
Collins. 20s.
The River of Diamonds. Geoffrey Jenkins.
Collins. 22s. 6d.
Into page 149 of “Albert Angelo” is cut
an oblong three lines deep. The same
oblong is naturally there on page 150;
there is another one on page 151, the
same size and in the same position,
which again naturally is there on page
152. Consequently, from page 149 it is
possible to read three lines of page 153.
This is not the result of the conscientious
vice squad in action, expurgating the
book’s protagonist Albert’s sex life, secret
thoughts or vocabulary. No, these are
“future seeing holes”.
The holes are perhaps the more ex-
treme of B. S. Johnson’s technical de-
vices, which he insists we are not to take
merely as gimmicks. And indeed, though
the novel is full of other tricks of typo-
graphy (one sequence consists of a double
column page and the two columns, when
they run side by side, are to be read
simultaneously) and full of ideas of
Joyce and Beckett and Sterne, gimmickry
is not the final impression.
Sometimes Albert tells his own ver-
sion of the story; sometimes he is
described by a third person narrator; one
section consists of the exercises his class
writes about what they think of him.
The possibilities for humor in the child-
ren's exercises are obviously consider-
able, and they are used fully. This is a
very amusing novel; but it is serious too
in its handling of the obsession about the
girl who left, in its evocation of the
place where Albert lives, and in its depic-
tion of the wanton brutality that, always
present in the novel, emerges disturbingly
at the end. And if the “attempts to re-
produce the moment - to - moment frag-
mentariness of life, my life, and to echo it
in technique, the fragmentariness, a col-
lage made of the fragments of my own
life” might seem to be founded naively
on fallacious, imitative theory, the result
is nonetheless impressive, very readable,
very alive.
Novelty in itself and for no purpose
can be fearfully boring. Peter Kinsley
tries for a modish, “with-it”, gimmicky
humor in “Three Cheers for Nothing”.
His hero lives inside a model whale in
the Natural History Museum, and is
called Jonathan Augustus Gaylord
Cheers. If the belly of the whale might
have suggested a Becketesque humor or
a Nathanael West satire, the reliance on
Augustus Gaylord as funny names should
dispel any illusions. In a very mechani-
cal attempt to avoid the sociological
realism of the ’fifties, this novel careers
through a world of scatty lords and
ladies eating in backstreet caffs because
the lady has fired the cook, debs and

guardsmen, and confidence tricksters
who speak in rhyming slang. Names of
good pubs and restaurants in London are
knowingly thrown in. But it isn’t very
funny, and the writing is totally lacking
in wit or subtlety. Some of the ideas are
promising — trying to sell a kinky
colored diplomat a girls’ private school.
But the episode itself —with the diplomat
pinching the sexy hockey captain’s
wiggly bottom —is dismally uninteresting.
Geoffrey Jenkins in “The River of
Diamonds” is modern enough in his
technical knowledge, but his novel is
splendidly traditional in the line of Rider
Haggard, John Buchan and Conan Doyle.
The fact that he has been praised by Ian
Fleming and by the “Church Times”
immediately arouses curiosity — how
could he possibly please both? Presu-
mably by the striking competence of his
handling of the classic adventure tale.
The plot—and there gloriously is a plot
—involves diamond prospecting off the
coast of SW Africa. A powerful combine
establishes its claim over the mysterious
Shelborne, who for thirty years has held
a right to prospect the area granted by
the German Imperial Government. But
he obtained it in doubtful circumstances
when he left his fellow prospector Cald-
well in the Namib desert. Caldwell never
returned. Shelborne now lives on a
storm-battered guano island that rocks
and moves all the time. And now Cald-
well’s daughter has grown up . . . The
plot is continually exciting, but there is
more than just that; the writing is ex-
tremely competent, and the descriptions
of the mining settlement in the middle of
the desert, patrolled by security police,
or of the windswept island where the
coffins cannot be buried but are cemented
to the rocks, are vividly realised. Com-
pulsively readable, “The River of Dia-
monds” is one of those rare books, an
adventure story that can be read with
no surrender of intelligence.

The saying that of the making of books
there is no end would be more appealing
in Australia if the antipodean publisher
would abandon his punch-drunk habit
of making books in categories. It be-
comes a little wearying to the reviewer
to find on his table week after week or
month after month a pile of volumes that
look as if they might be new works by
writers of world fame, to find that they
consist only of pedestrian, or not so
pedestrian, efforts about the same old
subjects issued in an edition limited to
what the publishers think they can
quickly sell on the strength of a fulsome
blurb (usually by the author) and a glazed
jacket of which the interior of the book
does not fulfil the promise.
Scarcely a month goes by that there
is not on the table a series of local his-
tories or descriptions of regions or shires
or towns or districts. Some of these, if
dull to the ordinary reader, prove valu-
able source books. One was Robert B.
Ronald’s “The Riverina”, issued in 1960,
which I think he had difficulty in getting
published, but which is well worth while
as a starting point for pastoral research,
not only about the area it deals with, but
about the expansions from the district
which were wide and historic both in
men and methods.
Some of the books which metropolitan
publishers are now bringing out have the
virtue of readability combined with
authenticity, even if they fall a little short
of what might have been expected
of the authors and the material. Such
a book is “The Mile that Midas Touched”
by Gavin Casey and Ted Mayman,
which is a version of the Kalgoorlie
goldfields history by two native sons, who
have put down the record clearly and
carefully, though hardly in a way to
justify the claim of the blurb that it is
one of the “most exciting and gripping
books of history ever written in Austra-
lia”. The authors sometimes exhibit the
duality of collaborators and they give
only a moderate inkling of the wild
raffishness of some of Kalgoorlie’s early
history. At times one has the illusion
of reading one of those family books of
autobiography by old gentlemen with
naughty pasts of which they are anxious
to hide the horrid details, while letting
out enough to suggest that they were
dogs in their day. But even at that it is
a good book; one that strikes chords of
memory in the minds of those who have
seen a new r and major mining town in the
full flush of its exuberance. Yet it is
not as good to my mind in its inner
authenticity as Raymond Pauli's little
“Old Walhalla Portrait of a Gold
Town”, which gets inside the reader who
has lived in gold towns.
Another category now being exploited
by publishers is that of the “Red Heart”.
The intent of volumes like this seems
to be to show what a magnificent para-
dise Central Australia is. The illustra-
tions in these books are usually either
official or press and are magnificent and
flattering, whether they note the terrors
of the bush as does Douglas Lockwood’s
“Up the Track”, of which the dust cover
shows a roadside picture with a stretch
of smooth bitumen in the background
and a fearsome and very civilised sign-
post saying “No Water till OT Downs
. . . 120 miles”.
No doubt this gives the passing tourist
a thrill but the terrors of waterless
stretches on any main route in the NT
are a thing of the past. The once
dreaded Murrinji Track had water every
15 miles last time I passed over it in
1946, and the last time I crossed the
much feared Eva Downs mail “perish”
of which the waterless 80 miles nsed to
inspire fear in every traveller, I never
even gave a thought to water. It was
half an afternoon's run to the OT. The
truth is that Central Australia has be-
come three worlds. In the background
is the pastoral industry with some fringe
agriculture and growing mining enter-
prise of immense value. The pastoral in-
dustry still struggles with drought, with
an added burden of labor shortage, and
rising costs to eat up the advantages of
quick transport to markets and higher
prices.
The fate of fringe agricultural enter-
prises, such as the Ord River irrigation,
is still in the balance. The mining indus-
try has its crosses to bear in the need for
huge capitalisation and labor problems.
And everybody permanent lives in a huge
tourist park peopled by visiting tourists—
largely retired businessmen and their
wives—and pushed around by reformers
and a cloud of civil servants.
The attractively produced “The Living
Heart” by (Revd) Frank Flynn, MSC,
with Keith Willey, and the interpretations
of Mr Lockwood, through the eyes of
Darwin journalism, of the Northern Ter-
ritory add several hundred more pages
to the reiterations about the mores and
features and quaint inhabitants of the
Northern Territory.
It may be wonderful that everybody
now knows the Devil’s Marbles and Bar-
row Creek, the beauty of the McDon-
nells, and that we have all been taught
that “Arunta” should be spelt “Aranda”
but to me to read these glib estimations
and school-book descriptions breeds a
nostalgia for the incomparable and beau-
tiful loneliness of the days when the
wind still could be heard singing in the
wires of the OT Line and there was no
roar of road trains, tourist buses, whirling
authors, aircraft; the days when you had
to prove it when you said you had been
to Ayer’s Rock.

Bogus Bureaucrats
The Golden Calf. Ilya Ilf and Yevgenii
Petrov. Muller. 26s. 6d.
“The Golden Calf” is a huge, romping
joke. Ostap Bender, the energetic con-
fidence man surrounded by his three
dubious “assistants”, uses every loophole
he can find to defraud another crook,
Alexander Koreiko, of his millions of
roubles. That these were amassed by
similar trickery and lead a precarious
and secret life in an old bag being shut-
tled from one railway luggage office to
another and back again because the timid
little millionaire clerk is unable to spend
any for fear of giving himself away, only
spices the hunt.
It is an idea in a direct line from
Lieutenant Kije, the soldier who never
lived except on paper to hide a Royal
mistake, and of Gogol's “Dead Souls”
where deceased serfs were the subject of
a business transaction. In “The Golden
Calf” it is the money itself which is dead.
After a hectic chase which includes pur-
suing Koreiko over half the country by
car, rail and camel, Bender gets the mil-
lions only to find that he cannot buy
anything he wants with them, either, not
even the girl his swivelling eye has
fancied. Finally, in a night flight across
the border he is robbed by the frontier-
guards on the other side and turns back
home a wiser man.
There is a decided moral in all this and
that might easily be the secret of its
success. Crime does not pay more than
a couple of roubles anywhere in the
book. The authors can show how easy
it is to set up a bogus bureau like the
State Horn and Hoof Association; or
they can slyly mention such Soviet art as
“The Bathing Collective-Farm Girl” or
clothing of “The Shock-Worker’s Dream”
tie variety; or canteen slogans: “Do not
converse during meals. It prevents the
proper secretion of stomach juices”; or
the old codger who is unable to have
even a decent Czarist dream at night,
anymore; or official poetry: “The iron
steed hurtles ahead, With historic bounds
on steel While our working family
Advances to errors reveal”; or the Rus-
sians’ continuing urge to break into that
melodic old folksong “Stenka Razin”—
the Cossack hero who chose to drown in
his valuable coat rather than to live
without it . . . all this can be said because
the confidence trickster gets his deserts
in the final count. It is as much a moral-
ity play as “Everyman”.
As for the characters, they remain
as crazily, endearingly, pungently Slav
as anything in Dostoyevsky or Pushkin.
Written in the ’thirties, it has taken a
long time for this book, excellently trans-
lated by John H. C. Richardson, to reach
us, but the fun is still astonishingly fresh.
MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Communist Has-beens
Communism and the French Intellectuals,
1914-1960. David Caute. Andre Deutsch.
64s.
David Caute, a young but mature scholar
from Oxford, sets out to seek the answer
to an intriguing riddle. Why has the
French Communist Party (PCF) succeed-
ed in attracting and holding the allegi-
ance of so many prominent, at times
famous, French intellectuals—despite the
basic shallowness of Marxist philosophy,
ideological bankruptcy of “international
Communism”, its disastrous economic
myths, rabid phobias and persistent use
of brutal force?
Over 400 scholarly pages (plus an im-
pressive bibliography and informative
additional notes) Mr Caute looks for an
answer to the riddle. Although his book
does not provide a clear-cut answer it
gives considerable insight into the mat-
ter.
Caute traces the career of many
prominent Communists, Communist sym-
pathisers and ex-Communists—from
Andre Malraux, today’s leading Gaullist
luminary, the controversial Jean-Paul
Sartre to Maurice Thorez (the late Com-
munist leader), and the Stalinist poet,
Louis Aragon. Surprisingly enough,
Thorez cuts a sincere and even sympa-
thetic figure. Louis Aragon, predictably,
does not.
The war years are exhaustively and
objectively treated and Mr Caute pays
tribute to the thousands of French Com-
munists murdered by the Nazis, but also
points out that in France, as elsewhere,
the Communist Party did not officially
oppose Hitler until after Germany in-
vaded the Soviet Union.
He feels that a part of the French in-
tellectuals’ fascination by Communism
is based on the twin myth that the
PCF is both a party of genuine, radical
change and a party of action. De Gaulle’s
dynamic policies have considerably re-
duced the attractiveness of this myth and
the PCF has found no answer to the
challenge of de Gaulle’s personal
“mystique”.
The Hungarian Revolution, Gomulka’s
bloodless coup in Poland and the long,
brutal Algerian war alienated the PCF
from the radical French Left.
Today, the PCF is an ageing, dogma-
tic and waning political force, leaning
heavily on nostalgic appeals to its early
days. Its hold on French intellectuals
is continuously slipping, while its leader-
ship is locked in bitter, intraparty faction
fights.
EUGENE BAJKOWSKI
A Poetry Bonanza
The London Magazine. Special Poetry Num-
ber. November, 1964.
This annual poetry number of the “Lon-
don Magazine” is one of the best that
has yet appeared. With drawings by
Sidney Nolan, it offers seventeen new
poems, among them pieces by Robert
Bly, Roy Fuller, Louis Simpson, Charles
Tomlinson, and, after all these years,
Stephen Spender.
Ten poets from the English-speaking
world, ranging from Elizabeth Jennings
to Judith Wright, contribute to this year’s
enquiry into the contemporary poet’s
attitude to the so-called modernist revolu-
tion. The answers begin well with
Robert Conquest’s: “All this talk about
responsibilities and ‘burdens’ seems to
me to be the merest cant. Poets can
only write in the way they themselves
feel appropriate, on themes which form
part of their properly assimilated, imagi-
native ballast. Good, individual poetry
came out of the experimentalist era, and
it is by now in the background of all
of us, together with the work of the pre-
vious 500 years”. Roy Fuller says that
the greatest danger for poetry lies in the
poet believing in poetry; and adds, “The
example of Yeats frightens one against
being dogmatic about the kind of beliefs
suitable for the modern poet”.
Among the critical articles there is
Julian Symons’ attack on Edith Sitwell:
“Hers is the verse of somebody who has
not felt deeply, but has felt how import-
ant it is to feel deeply, and has expressed
her awareness of this.”
But perhaps the highlight of the whole
issue is the series of interviews with
Thom Gunn, Philip Larkin, Christopher
Middleton and Charles Tomlinson. All
claim that England is poetically dull at
the moment; but they exist, with three
or four others, to prove that this isn’t
the case at all.
VIVIAN SMITH


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Devaluation Pressures
Britain’s actions to halt the run on sterling (by higher
internal interest rates and the import surcharge) may
be inadequate if European and US holders decide that
devaluation is the only course left open. Even official
European Central Bank support can go so far and no
farther.
Although the UK Government has issued strong denials
of its intention to devalue, there is plenty of outside pressure
exerted by speculators and nervous holders who don’t want
to get caught by any alteration in the exchange rate.
If this outside pressure continues to grow meaning
that all types of business groups will attempt to minimise
their risks in sterling—a situation will be created where the
Bank of England is unable to support the £lstg at the
minimum floor level of 2.78£ US dollars. For four weeks it
has been meeting the demands of sellers and was obliged
to pay out between £3O million and £6O million on the
Friday before the Wilson Government upped the Bank Rate
from 5 to 7 p.c. in an effort to stop the drain on sterling.
Evidence shows there has been consistent selling of
sterling each Friday, as holders attempted to avoid being
caught by a week-end devaluation, the obvious time when
such official action would be taken.
Despite Britain’s assurance that it can obtain loans
totalling several hundred million pounds to help cover its
balance-of-payments deficit, there is no outward confidence
that this in itself would be sufficient to offset any psycho-
logical pressures arising from European and American con-
victions that sterling must fall.
Even the EFTA partners in Europe, after approving
Britain’s right to draw at least one thousand million dollars
in its standby agreement with the International Monetary
Fund, pointed out that Britain has already gone into hock
for at least four hundred million dollars in its borrowing
from the European Central Banks and the Federal Reserve.
The pressure placed on the IMF to finance Britain’s
standby borrowings will require some fairly hefty selling
of gold to European countries in exchange for their cur-
rencies and will also require the fund to dip heavily into its
holdings of existing currencies. The IMF is not expected to
cash much of its 3} billion US dollars without causing
problems about existing arrangements.
If sterling devalues, it can cause a weakening of other
currencies, as the sterling area currencies are intertwined
forcibly with the reserves held by banking institutions
throughout the world. The bulk of Australia’s overseas
reserves held in London is in sterling and any attempt to
switch into gold or dollars would cause acute embarrass-
ment. Britain’s move to devalue sterling would make her
exports much cheaper on world markets and give her a
temporary advantage (if others don’t devalue). But it would
have considerable future impact on manufacturing costs
because her imports of raw materials would be dearer,
NZ, already at parity with the £stg, would have her
pound valued higher than sterling.
Australia, faced with the devaluation of sterling, also
would have to consider whether she would follow the
British move either all the way or part of the way down.
If Australia stood pat during the devaluation of sterling
it would mean that imports from the sterling area would
be cheaper but there would be a corresponding increase
in the cost of Australia’s exports to Britain, thus rendering
them less competitive. With Japanese imports increasing
steadily, Australia would have an imports crisis.
While official circles insist that devaluation will be
avoided at all costs, there is no doubt that if world business
centres take it into their heads that sterling must devalue,
it will be hard to avoid this course.
The result of such a move could cause a round of de-
valuation adjustments in other currencies (as occurred in
1949), so the original move by sterling could be cancelled
out. At best, devaluation is a temporary experiment, pro-
viding a breathing space overnight. In unsold stocks it
makes the previous import content of Britain’s processed
goods, say, 10 p.c. or 20 p.c. cheaper. But it undermines
the confidence of those who make long-term investments
in sterling assets.
If the dollar stays steady, it would do so only by facing
up to the fact that the devalued currencies would stimulate
foreign exports to the US, whereas US exports would find
the going much tougher.
Britain’s increase in Bank Rate will not only encourage
British money to stay home but also attract US capital,
despite the restrictive effect of the US Interest Equalisation
Tax on American overseas investment. This hurts America’s
balance of payments and tends to chip away at the dollar
by putting further pressure on the price of gold, which is
something the US Administration wants to avoid. Any in-
crease in the price of gold is a devaluation of the dollar
and plays into the hands of Communist countries who are
forced to sell gold on the open market to finance many
of their commodity purchases. At this stage, therefore, it
is in Washington’s interests that sterling remains firm.
Meanwhile, Britain can take further protective measures,
including a tax on the outflow of funds.

3M Looks Us Over
HThe US Interest Equalisation Tax, which is designed to
restrict the flow of dollar investments abroad, takes
on greater significance with the beckoning influence of
higher interest rates in the UK. There now might appear
to be greater justification to retain it as a permanent piece
of machinery. But Mr Bert S. Cross, 145,000-dollars-a-
-year president of the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
Company (3M), says that US businessmen still regard the
tax as temporary.
In any case, US companies which own 10 p.c. or more
of the combined voting power of an overseas company
don’t have any problems in obtaining funds for their over-
seas operations.
Mr Cross headed a six-man group of senior executives
which visited Australia last week to look at growth pros-
pects and management set-up. The 3M visitors would not
admit to any special plans, other than an apparent desire
by a couple of them to see if any 3M products existed
inside a few nightspots.
Since 1952, the 3M company has built up an operation
in Australia involving a £4m. investment in assets and
employing 800 people. Activities include an abrasives
factory at St Marys, NSW. The group relies heavily on
research to develop new products, which it manufactures in
28 overseas countries, giving it a total sales figure of
761 million dollars in 1963.
The company completed an important deal recently
when it acquired the Ferrania photographic company in
Italy, through which it hopes to compete with the mighty
Eastman Kodak. The 3M group already is a large manu-
facturer of dry photo-copying papers, infra-red copying
systems, micro-film machines, Thermo-Fax office copiers,
etc.
Essentially a growth company, 3M has developed a
35-million-dollar research organisation which is continu-
ally coming up with new products, including the very suc-
cessful development of transparent tape, magnetic tape and
presensitised aluminium lithographic plates. A long drawn
out anti-trust suit involves a charge that 3M has controlled
prices in these three profitable fields, which is taken to
indicate that, if the US Government is successful in proving
its case, prices will have to come down, thus prodding (if
it needs prodding) 3M into new activities.
Hooker Still Long-term
'Negotiations by real estate developer L. J. Hooker
Corporation for US partners are based on an essen-
tially long-term project, and this also should be the attitude
adopted by the public investor towards the shares. Ob-
viously an overseas partner should be interested in the
general pattern of world development and not just particu-
larly in Australia. For example, the prospect of a world
beef shortage in 1970 could influence an institutional
investor to grab a stake in this industry now.
Also, if an institution seeks long-term security in its
investment, the prospect of gradually increasing land and
property values is a powerful incentive. Hooker, with its
pastoral and property development activities, fits the bill
very nicely.
Gradually, and a little more painfully, the L. J. Hooker
group is recovering from the effects of the 1960 credit
squeeze and has learnt the lesson of attempting to finance
too many projects from its own resources (and debenture
borrowing). Today, the Hooker Corporation emerges more
clearly as a property specialist, pre-selling to institutions on
a lease-back arrangement and planning its developments
many years ahead. By doing this, of course, it eliminates
the prospect of large initial projects it can’t finance and
it gains steady income which will tend to snowball in later
years.
A typical proposition these days is where a new building
under construction is sold to an insurance company on a
progress-payments basis, where the equity of L. J. Hooker
is restricted to a profit-sharing agreement. This formula
varies, but it could involve 6 p.c. of profits to the Hooker
group in the first year, 6J p.c. for four years, 7k p.c. for
the next 20 years and then all the profit after that.
By bringing in overseas uncles, L. J. Hooker possibly
may arrange a rolLover of debt, the refinancing of short-
term debt on a long-term basis and some form of equity
interest.
There are problems to consider, of course, including the
discouraging Interest Equalisation Tax in the US and the
need to establish some arrangement (jointly if possible)
to share any disadvantages from a currency devaluation.
But income return can offset this. It is evident that the
way has already been paved by the Hooker offshoot,
Hooker Finance Co. Ltd, in which Lockheed Aircraft has
taken a 20 p.c. capital interest and Fidelity Philadelphia
Trust has taken a 10 p.c. interest.
Looking at the Hooker Corporation accounts for
1963-64, the group was only able to reduce the P. and L.
deficit from £l.6m. to £1.3m., indicating that some size-
able profits are still necessary to wipe out this figure. Never-
theless, earning rate (after £21,608 for tax where accu-
mulated tax losses evidently did not apply) comes out at
7 p.c. Under new tax proposals, no benefits from accumu-
lated tax losses can accrue after this year. However, in
two years’ time the trend towards higher profits should
make itself felt, even after tax.
Banker’s Meditations
Tt is not so very often that the private trading bankers
A go out of their way to pat official monetary authorities
on the back. The chairman of the National Bank of
Australasia, Mr J. A. Forrest, did exactly that last week.
His praiseworthily detached address to shareholders de-
serves full study. Before launching on more general reflec-
tions, Mr Forrest came straight to a point on official be-
havior: “The Government was faced with the risk of an
inflationary situation and is to be commended for taking
early action instead of waiting for evidence that prosperity
had accelerated into boom conditions.”
There followed, not surprisingly, the usual ritual com-
plaints about the burden of statutory reserve deposits, in
which Mr Forrest was later reinforced by the directors’
report of the Bank of NSW. He bolstered the argument by
quoting from a US Governmental Committee’s survey of
financial institutions.
“Although their primary function is to serve as a ful-
crum for monetary policy, reserve requirements have other
effects which are pertinent to policy judgments about the
structure and level of requirements. Reserve requirements
affect the earning power of banks . . . since these require-
ments determine the proportion of bank assets that must
be held in the form of cash,” this committee, under the
chairmanship of the redoubtable Mr Walter Heller, re-
marked.
Mr Forrest then examined the necessity for monetary
policies to give “much greater attention to the ways in
which money and savings may be used outside the banking
system and the effects these have on business and trading
activity.” He philosophically faced reduction of the trading
banks’ share, yet felt, so far as Australia was concerned,
“the decline has been inordinately severe”.

New Slants on Loan Market
Dr R. F. Henderson examines monetary management
11/Tra inflation well inside Britain’s
door, sterling crumbling around the
ears of the Wilson Government, a
£stgBoo million balance of payments
deficit looming up for the current year
and all sorts of panic measures including
a rise from 5 to 7 p.c. in the Bank of
England rate being taken to hold the line,
last week didn’t seem to be quite the
occasion to be extolling the virtues of
monetary and fiscal devices for economic
containment in the Old Country.
Indeed from where we sit it would
seem to have been more appropriate had,
say, some Australian economist been
telling grandmother to suck eggs instead
of an imported one, Dr R. F. Henderson,
the British economist running the new
School of Applied Economics Research
at Melbourne University, picking holes
in our local devices and suggesting filling
them with products from Smith Street,
Westminster.
No reflection on Dr Henderson is
intended by this. In fact we are lucky
to have him here and are certainly
obliged to him for his brilliant paper,
given at the Australian Institute of Man-
agement, in which he broke new ground
in his approach to the problems of
monetary management here. As a matter
of fact, if we can forget about the mess
in Britain at the moment, his advice is
pretty timely, coming as it does after
the £lO million under-subscription to the
£6O million November Commonwealth
loan. He has certainly provided much
food for thought by the authorities, who
don’t appear to have been at all shocked
by the loan result. which still leaves
them less than half way towards the
year’s loan target of £275 millions with
the best periods of liquidity behind them
for the year.
TTaving written his piece before the loan
result, Dr Henderson was not join-
ing in the post-mortems on it, though
what he had to say was distinctly
apposite to them in that he uncovered
some of the very spots in our loan raising
procedures which have bedevilled the
efforts of the authorities this year. For
the moment it suffices to say that one
of these is the irregularity of the flow of
short-term money into the loans, a point
which, behind his mask, Mr Holt seemed
to be worried about when bemoaning
the fact that the short-term tranche only
brought in £6 million this time as against
£2l million in the oversubscribed August
loan and a pathetic £4.8 million in the
ill-fated May loan.
This brings us to suggestions Dr Hen-
derson put up to improve the efficiency
of the Government’s loan raising tech-
niques. Talking about rigidities in the
Australian capital market, he criticised
the practice of issuing Commonwealth
bonds three or four times a year at a
definite price and the provisions made
for advance subscriptions and the accep-
tance of over-subscriptions. He thinks
several unfortunate results come from
this.
One is that it produces big surges and
so an uneven flow of institutional invest-
ment in Commonwealth bonds. “The
institutions pour in funds to an issue if
R. F. HENDERSON
they think the subsequent ones may be
at a lower rate of interest. This disturbs
the flow of funds from the institutions
to the private sector in a manner which
does not promote steady growth. When,
on the contrary, the institutions expect
that the subsequent issue will be at a
higher coupon rate they subscribe very
little to the current loan and probably
soon start lodging advance subscriptions
to the next one.
“Nor does it produce a smooth adjust-
ment of interest rates on Commonwealth
bonds. This can be seen most clearly
if the present system is compared with
a ‘tap’ procedure, as employed in Lon-
don, where the effective supply of Gov-
ernment securities is provided by con-
tinuous selling of tap stocks (usually one
long, one medium and one short) by the
Government broker. (New issues are
nominally made but are almost wholly
taken up by the issue department of the
Bank of England and used to supply the
tap.)
“Under this system the authorities can
achieve smooth changes of price in Gov-
ernment securities either in order to
restrain or stimulate the economy or in
response to market forces; a big volume
of institutional buying will tend to raise
prices, a reduction in the rate of buying
to lower them.
‘‘Tf under the tap system the institutions
were to take a view (as some of
them did in May, 1964, in Australia)
that the next Government loan would
probably be at higher interest rates, they
would reduce their rate of purchasing
and thus depress prices of Government
securities, and raise the level of market
interest rates. These lower security
prices would tempt in some marginal
buyers.
“Thus under the tap system in such
circumstances interest rates rise sooner
than under the present Australian system
and the volume of purchases of Govern-
ment securities does not diminish so
much as under the present Australian
system. Now both these results of the
tap system are desirable. Restraint of
the economy requires a rise in interest
rates. To mop up surplus liquidity and
prevent it from causing a speculative
boom it is desirable that the flow of
institutional funds into the purchase of
Government securities be maintained or
even increased.”
On the other hand, Dr Henderson
thinks it is possible for the authorities
operating the Australian system to
achieve results similar to those of the
tap system, but this would require much
more positive action. Thus, when ad-
vance subscriptions flow in rapidly, the
authorities could move into the market
to buy bonds and so effect a rise in
prices.
He also considers that the present
system hinders the development of a
wide market in Government securities.
Since the main purchasers of such
securities —the large financial institutions
—obtain their supplies by subscriptions
and advance subscriptions to Govern-
ment loans, there is not enough general
buying support for the market on a day-
to-day basis. This thin market makes it
very difficult for the authorities to
achieve smooth, gradual adjustments of
security prices by open market opera-
tions.
In Dr Henderson’s view the transition


towards a tap system could be made
gradually. “If the privileges of advance
subscriptions and acceptance of over-
subscriptions were abolished and a sub-
stantial block of cash Commonwealth
loan allotted to the Reserve Bank on
firm underwriting terms this would
enable a good start to be made. A sub-
stantial volume of securities would then
be purchased on the market by the
institutions from the Reserve Bank and
others. This steady buying for the
accretion of funds to many financial
institutions does proceed pretty steadily
—would encourage selling on the market
also, whether of securities becoming
short for switching, or reinvestment of
funds in other ways. It is no longer
necessary to keep the advance subscrip-
tion privilege for the benefit of in-
dividuals as they are catered for by tap
issues of special bonds.”
He is also critical of the 30:20 ratio
for investment of funds by insurance
companies and pension funds and
believes it should be perfectly possible
to regulate fairly the tax on ordinary
shares and Government bonds respec-
tively without the imposition of this type
of ratio. “The rates of tax on each class
of security should be fixed; they should
not vary according to the composition
of the portfolio of the institution holding
them. The ratio is not necessary to
obtain institutional subscriptions to Com-
monwealth bond issues and its rigidity
and complications are a serious obstacle
to a flexible monetary policy,” he says.
Dr Henderson also expressed the hope
that a further step towards flexibility may
include abandonment of a fixed price of
issue for Treasury Notes —“an anomaly
in a sensitive short term market”. Again,
“the introduction of commercial paper
on to the market would further extend
its influence and so the reach of
monetary policy operating through that
market”.
A full copy of Dr Henderson’s thought-
provoking paper should be sent to the
monetary authorities without delay. Some
of his suggestions have already been
broached in The Bulletin. Now they
have this added authority.
Why So Nasty to GM-H?
A review of “Big Wheels and Little Wheels”
Tf John Veich’s biography of L. J. Hart-
nett, Big Wheels and Little Wheels,
were no more than an arresting inside
account of the growing pains of General
Motors-Holden’s up to the eve of pro-
ducing the first Holden in 1948 it would
still have been well worth waiting for.
As it is, we get so much more.
Written entirely by Veich, the story
reads in the first person as if Hartnett
himself had done the writing. This is a
bit confusing, the more so because al-
though Veich gets a minor attribution of
authorship on the dust cover, Hartnett’s
name is the only one on the stiff one.
Such is the fate of ghost-writers. A pity,
since in this case the writing is high-class
and should encourage Veich to inde-
pendent efforts. The two men worked
about four years on the book. The final
product is a tribute also to the finished
hand and red pencil of Lloyd O'Neill,
managing director of Lansdowne Press
the publishers, who according to Veich
cut the original text by about half.
O'Neill says it is the most important
book his firm has handled. It has been
handled very well.
Its revelations about GM-H are of
absorbing interest, but no more so than
the general theme into which they are
woven. This is the intimate life story
of an Englishman (now the staunchest
of Australians) who, after having been
schooled in the RAF and Vickers, was in
his heyday a veritable production fireball
flashing over the international industrial
scene in the colors of General Motors
Corporation. It was only by chance
that he flashed into the Australian orbit
under GMC's auspices. That was thirty
years ago, when the immediate object of
his coming was to get the newly formed
General Motors-Holden’s on its feet (it
was a merger of the old established
Holden Motor Body Building Company
and General Motors Pty Ltd, which
operated assembly plants in five States).
It is not just a matter of picking Hart-
L J. HARTNETT
nett up when he arrives in Australia, a
top GMG production man, fresh from
triumphs in America, Sweden and Bri-
tain, a man who has won the confidence
of the Corporation’s toppest brass in
battles for new markets and new produc-
tion lines. The story of how he won that
confidence is there in full. In the telling
we get an illuminating spotlight on the
men, thinking and methods which made
GMC the world’s biggest seller of motor
vehicles and which later in the tale are
shown to be almost cosy compared with
the ruthless international tactics Hartnett
purports to be the yardsticks of the GMC
hierarchy today.
The tale of how he lost that confi-
dence, stumbled somewhere, perhaps in
several places, along the bridge linking
the old GMC attitudes to the new is
there too. Hartnett is depicted as always
a pace-setter. The truth shines through
that ultimately in Australia he was set-
ting too hot a pace in too many contro-
versial directions for GMC to let him out
on his own. He refused to come back to
the field and virtually had to be dumped
overboard.
The telling of this is somewhat agoni-
sing. Was it simply that he wanted to
put Australia first and expect GMC to
tag along? If so, he couldn’t expect it
to wash in Detroit. He sours. But with
plenty of other things to do, even open
up in competition with the old firm by
attempting to make (at the request of the
Chifley Government) his own car, he
nurses his wounds. Now (rather too
strongly for the reader’s comfort, mine
anyway), he seems to be coming back too
strongly against GM-H after its success
and his own failure to make a car.
One of the most fascinating aspects
of the book is the insight given into the
build-up and gearing of Australian indus-
try in the last war, when from the begin-
ning Hartnett was Director of Ordnance
Production, under Essington Lewis,
Director-General of Munitions, turning
ploughshares to swords. We get, too, a
little of the aftermath of war with Hart-
nett, no longer with GM-H but out on
his own, playing for his own high stakes
and taking his chances with Govern-
ments, politicians and the fates, getting
other rebuffs yet not letting disillusion-
ment swamp him, ever.
On the part ordnance orders played
in lifting GM-H's operation to a higher
platform, from which the Holden car
project could better be launched, the
book is frankness itself. Mr Hartnett
refuses to go on the defensive about
this, even to his explaining why the
foundry (for making marine engines
during the war) was built at Fisherman’s
Bend. The most intriguing angle on this
is the fear Hartnett imputed to the Du
Pont interests (they own 40 p.c. of
General Motors Corporation) of being
vulnerable to witch hunts for getting

Government contracts out of turn in their
Australian operations. This passage
from a searching chapter, “Why I Left
GM-H”, explains:
“When I visited the US during the war,
Harry Phillips, then GM regional direc-
tor for the Pacific zone, looked up from
some Australian reports he was reading
and said, ‘You know, Larry, you’ll never
get away with this—and neither will
we’.”
“What are you referring, to?” I said.
“This war job you’ve been holding
down all these years: Director of Ord-
nance Production. All the major pro-
jects for GM-H are coming from your
Directorate: the two-pounder gun, the
six-pounder, the twenty-five-pounder, tor-
pedoes, tanks, trucks . . .”
“I laughed and said, ‘Oh, there were
a lot more projects than that, Harry’.”
“Yes, well I don’t think it’s funny,”
he said. “When this war’s over there'll
be a parliamentary enquiry down in Aus-
tralia that will make your name and
General Motors stink to high heaven.
You wait and see. There’ll be publicity of
the worst kind—and it will all get here
in the headlines, too. You don’t know
what you’ve let yourself and us in for.”
“I said, ‘Harry, you’re worrying for
nothing. It doesn't work that way in
Australia. You're too close to the
American witch-hunting methods. No one
in Australia considers that GM-H and
Larry Hartnett have done anything but a
good job for Australia. And that is the
true picture.
‘I have not directly given one dollar’s
worth of Government business to GM-H.
It has been passed on to GM-H by what
we call Boards of Area Management
which select the contractor best equipped
for the production requirements. All
my shares and properties have been held
in trust by a senior Government official,
at my request, since the first day I took
on the job. Believe me, you and General
Motors have nothing to fear’.”
Hartnett puts up several other reasons
why the new men in Detroit wanted his
head. He postulates his closeness to the
principals of the Curtin and later Chifley
Governments as one of these. There
could have been something in this.
Because, after his unpromising start on
the first morning of making the Curtin
Cabinet's acquaintance, when two Minis-
ters accused him of being in league with
Sir Keith Murdoch of the “Herald and
Weekly Times”, Hartnett became one of
their top henchmen in the war effort and
the link continued into the postwar
period. The reader is thrown into the
thick of controversial issues such as this.
Mutual sympathy is evidently still
strong. A flattering telegram from Mr
Arthur Calwell was read at the launching
of the book. The ALP would seem to
synchronise with Hartnett’s view that
something ought to be done about
GM-H, not knowing quite what. A bit
embarrassing for both of them, this.
Without Hartnett, Mr Calwell says, Aus-
tralia wouldn’t have got the Holden
car. This is probably perfectly true,
but as the book shows in detail it was the
Labor Government which laid down the
conditions and the whole project wouldn't
have left the ground without Chifley’s
nod to H. T. Armitage, then Governor
of the Reserve Bank, to lend GM-H the
necessary funds. GMC had refused to
put up a nickel and would have pre-
ferred to have stuck to assembling, as
they had before the war.
The matter of GM-H would still seem
to be very much on Mr Hartnett’s mind,
even though today his business interests
lie elsewhere (the author brings us right
up to date on these). Obviously there
is a lot of fight still left in what is now
a dog getting on in years and apparently
still restless in pursuit of triumphs in the
world of his life-long love—motor cars.


Men for All Seasons
The air conditioner and heater makers
/Companies in the air-conditioning and
heating business are enthusiastic
about their future prospects. With
weather reaching heat-wave proportions
throughout Australia last week and the
natural demand for heating appliances
during winter they have good reason to
be.
Both appliances could reasonably be
classified as luxuries, the electric radiator
perhaps a little less than the room air-
conditioner. Yet manufacturers The
Bulletin spoke to say the market is
there and will continue to grow. In
domestic air-conditioning, one manu-
facturer, so overjoyed at the prospect of
a long hot summer, has oversold one of
his models by 69!
Obviously he does not want his name
mentioned and is now rather perturbed
about satisfying the forward orders. He
believes, though, that the situation indi-
cates a return to the boom air-condition-
ing days of 1959-60.
The production of radiators and elec-
tric fires has risen steadily over the past
few years, while production of room air-
conditioners has been somewhat erratic,
due no doubt to the variety of summers
Australia has been experiencing in recent
years. The following table shows pro-
duction of both appliances since 1954-55.

Domestic, or residential, air-condition-
ers fall into two categories. Firstly there
is the window unit, the completely self-
contained conditioner; then there is the
packaged unit, comprising usually a
separate compressor and refrigeration
unit connected by pipes to the unit con-
taining the fan which circulates air
through ducting. The former is in the
£2OO to £3OO price range, the latter
costs from £l2OO to £l5OO for a ten-
square home.
A spokesman for Carrier Air Condi-
tioning said that on the residential side
air-conditioning business was gaining
greater acceptance. “The air-conditioner
is not nearly as popular in Australia as it
is in America and this is one of the
reasons for the high price. Until it be-
comes more popular here we cannot pro-
duce in the volume they do in the US.
And it will not become more popular in
Australia until houses are designed to
take air-conditioning.
“With the single room air-conditioner
the design of the house is not really im-
portant, since it is intended to provide
comfort in only one room. With the
packaged unit, however, prices can vary
widely, depending on the amount of glass
in the home, which way it faces and
where the living and sleeping areas are
located in relation to the sun. Obviously
a house with a lot of glass is going to be
more expensive to condition than one
with a moderate amount.
“In the US, air-conditioning is more
popular because families live in more. It
is also cheaper to install because they
usually have a furnace in the basement
and the duct work for heating can be
connected to a cooling instead of a heat-
ing system. But we are seven or eight
years behind America in both our resi-
dential and commercial air-conditioning,
It has not gained nearly the acceptance in
this country as it has in the US,” the
spokesman added.
Several companies which used to pro-
duce room air-conditioners have left the
field. Said one: “We started in 1960
when we were getting a toehold in the
domestic electrical appliance market.
Production was proceeding at a tremen-
dous pace and anticipated sales were an
all-time high. There were price-cutting
wars, far more promotion and advertising
than there is now, and then, bang, the
axe fell. The November, 1960, credit
squeeze probably did more harm to this
industry proportionately than it did to
any other.
“The competition is still there now
and there is a degree of price-cutting,
but it has become much more rational.”
The largest company in the domestic
air-conditioning business is Kelvinator.
Apart from producing under its own
name it also manufacturers for other
companies. An executive of Kelvinator
told The Bulletin the market for resi-
dential air-conditioning at present was the
best it had ever been. “Its potential
looks better than 1959-60, when there
was the last good long heatwave.
“In that year sales and production
reached proportions never anticipated.
The next year we had a bad summer,
capped off by the credit squeeze. That
was when some manufacturers started to
get out of the industry and we got hold
of a large slice of the market. We
never thought we could get as much as
we did. But this summer we have a
lot to look forward to.
“The growth rate in domestic air-con-
ditioning, provided the seasons are with
us, is about 20 p.c. a year. Last year
it went up 50 p.c. on the year before.
We know now that for this summer we
will be out of stock before we’re half
yyay through the season.
“Ani: of the biggest sales problems we
have to overcome is firstly the buy-
er's reluctance to spend money for some-
thing he doesn’t understand and secondly
the cost, which at the moment is pretty
prohibitive for the average family.”
The executive said sales per head of
population of room conditioners fell into
a definite pattern in Australia. “NSW
was the most popular State in 1958-59-
60; things really looked magnificent for
the future. Then in the credit squeeze,
sales in Sydney really took a battering.
Between the credit squeeze and now,
South Australia has taken up a lot of the
slack.

"C'rom summer to winter, where the
A cold season plays a very important
part in heating appliance sales, an execu-
tive of a large Melbourne company said
the market for electrical heating ap-
pliances was buoyant at present. “Popu-
larity has grown rapidly in the last few
years, probably due to price, convenience
and cleanliness. The product range has
more than doubled in the past five years,
so that a plain old radiator is only pur-
chased today on the spur of the moment,
usually after a cold spell or to heat a
room in which one of the children has to
do his homework. Future trends will
probably be to the tangential heater (a
small element whose heat is circulated
by a fan) and the silicon tube-covered
element, as incorporated in the latest wall
bar-heaters.
“The silicon tube concentrates the
heat so that the unit warms faster than
any normal element. Extra cost will be
the factor that limits growth.
“There are four main factors affecting
demand. The rate of house-building is,
of course, the most vital. Only for the
very small items is there in any sense
a replacement market. Spot buying,
usually after two or three mornings of
bad frost, has a marked effect. Then
again, the weather has two sides to con-
sider. Sales vary according to the
severeness of a winter and the date that
winter arrives. If it is late, then a lot
of people feel they may as well do with-
out a heater, since spring and the warmer
weather are not very far away.”
Spokesman for another Melbourne
company forecast a big demand for built-
in oil heating units. “These are going to
have a real impact on the market. They
have really hit the solid fuel units al-
ready. Although they’re dearer and more
trouble to install than electricity or gas
heating, they have a longer life and are
much cheaper to run and more con-
venient to operate than anything else on
the market.”

Commodity prices and British bank rate
Immediate reaction to Britain’s sharp
A lift in the bank discount rate from
5 p.c. to 7 p.c. was an easing in com-
modity prices.
The implication is that no one wants
to finance heavy stocks at a high rate
of interest.
Wool auctions in Sydney the next day
reflected the withdrawal of UK buyers
and values dropped. In London the com-
modities market slipped, even though
there are admitted shortages, notably
metals.
Several countries followed the rise in
bank rate, with the, US and Canada
quickly making a not-so-steep adjustment
and indicating that everyone is nervous
about protecting his own currency against
capital outflows.
★ ★ ★
T7rom a commodities viewpoint, there
could be a lack of support in the
short term. But, if the sterling crisis eases
and interest rates fall again, there would
be a rush from buyers anxious to re-
stock.
★ ★ ★
this tends to cause wide fluctua-
tions, many of which are evened
out over the longer term. Investors,
therefore, should be cautioned against
buying and selling on day-to-day in-
fluences.
A typical see-saw operation recently
was the sharp lift in New Broken Hill
because of the reduction in the scale of
State royalty payments. Within a day
or so, share prices were knocked sharply
because of fears that the higher UK bank
rate would curtail commodity purchases.
New BH, however, must show the
benefits of a bumper year to December,
1964, and is expected at least to main-
tain its 4s. (sterling) dividend on the ss.
shares, which already offer a yield of
more than 5 p.c.
There are some who believe a capital
reconstruction could take place, too.

TTnited Holdings came out with a
better result than most insurance
companies have been reporting lately
and also added its usual one-for-eight
bonus the fourth bonus since it joined
the Stock Exchange official list in Decem-
ber, 1960.
Doubtless there were some who were
disappointed the company did not an-
nounce a takeover, or whatever it was
they were expecting after a heavy run
of stock option buying in previous weeks.
On reflection, the rise in profits and
the maintenance of earning rate on
bonus-enlarged capital could prove at-
tractive to others in the field, who are
harassed by rising costs and falling
margins.
Queensland Insurance, whose share
price recovered rapidly round about the
time market interest faded in United
Holdings, has a sufficiently large market
premium to make an attractive acquisi-
tion.

Takeover Battle Looming
Automotive Components gets “approaches”
At the time of going to press it appears
** most likely that a takeover battle
is looming for Melbourne-based Auto-
motive Components For shareholders,
such a prospect must indeed sound
pleasing. It could completely remove
the sting from the tumbling prices which
taunted their scrip until a few weeks
ago, when Repco made its first overture
to the tune of about 7s. Bd. a share.
Even more important is the fact that,
if a battle does start, there is every
chance that they will get their full
financial revenge over the three directors
(now resigned) who managed to sell
more than 40,000 shares for an average
price of about 9s. before the company’s
poor 1963-64 results were released.
Last week, the two remaining directors
plus the newly appointed chairman (Mr
W. W. Buck) advised shareholders that
the company had received “other ap-
proaches” on which they would make a
statement during the first two weeks of
December. In the meantime they
suggested the delaying of any decisions.
They would not name any new bidders
and said the outcome of these approaches
could not be predicted at present. How-
ever, it is believed that overseas com-
panies or their local subsidiaries may be
the interested parties.
When informed of the position, a
spokesman for Repco said the bid would
be reconsidered once it was known that
another offer had been made and at what
price thus leaving the door open to
increase the current bid. The chances of
this appear to be particularly high. In
the first place, past experience has shown
that any first bid is below what the
bidder is actually prepared to pay.
Second, and probably more important, is
the fact that Auto. Comps would play a
valuable if not integral part in Repco’s
current policy of planned expansion.
Quite apart from this, a successful take-
over will widen Repco’s base and
eliminate a certain competitive element.
Whatever the outcome, it seems in-
evitable that the shares will be worth
more than Bs. in the end. Rumors of
other bids last week took the price up
to Bs. 3d. at one stage. That was before
the directors made the present position
known.

Explaining the losses, the board said
continued difficulties on the Mt Isa rail-
way project were a main contributing
factor. Accounts show that M. R. Hor-
nibrook Pty, the main operating subsi-
diary, lost £228,890. The principal cause
of this was a loss of £171,227 on the
railway, in which the company holds a
30 p.c. contracting interest.
Completion of the railway is expected
this year, meaning, say directors, further
losses which, however, are not specified.
Chairman Sir Manuel Hornibrook is
hopeful some losses will be recouped
when final settlement is made on the
Mt Isa project.
Disposal of certain assets over the past
year has improved liquidity and enabled
the company to enter into contracts
totalling £2.5 million. These are ex-
pected to be profitable.
Tender Pickings
A ustralian investors last week enjoyed
the novelty of applying for shares
by tender when Mullens and Co., Sydney
stockbrokers, offered 285,000 ss, shares
in Nuttall Holdings on behalf of O’Con-
nell Investments Limited, a 28 p.c. con-
trolled associate.
But it was not strictly a tender. Clients
were told in a circular they were un-
‘ likely to be successful if they tendered
below 10s. 3d., plus brokerage. The
danger of this, of course, is that they
could be encouraged to bid unrealistic
prices, because preference of allotment
will go to the highest bidder.

The only guide prospective investors
can have is the yield that an engineering
stock like this should command. At the
minimum acceptable tender of 10s. 6d.
including brokerage, the yield is only 4.7
p.c. on the proposed 10 p.c. dividend.
More encouraging is the earnings yield
of 9.8 p.c.
The application form to be used by
the tenderer gives an analysis of prices
as high as 13/-, at which level the divi-
dend yield would be only 3.8 p.c.
Earning rate on the issued capital was
20.6 p.c. in 1963-64, which gives a good
cover for a 10 p.c. dividend. But assets
backing is 6s. 5d., and surely investors
(looking for a profit) would hesitate to
offer prices which initially would yield
them only 3.8 p.c.
If the sale goes through at high prices,
the selling company, O’Connell Corpora-
tion, must show a nice profit and might
be a better bet at 10s., especially with
such a tight capital and an assets back-
ing of 10s. 6d.
Fighting Fire Fighting
T7ire Fighting Equipment Ltd, which
returned to the dividend list in Sep-
tember after a £38,811 loss in 1962-63,
is enjoying a period of increased sales
and profits. Chairman Mr W. R. Bailey
told the annual meeting the company in-
tended to reduce its number of operating
subsidiaries. Ten will be closed down
during the current financial year in the
interests of efficiency.
A noble effort in making sales in Hong
Kong, Ceylon, the Philippines and
Pacific Islands was hampered by the
steep increase in labor costs which
tended to price the company out of cer-
tain foreign markets.
The company’s ss. shares currently
yield 5.5 p.c. from their purchase price
of ss. 6d.
High Time
T>onsford Newman and Benson, the
Melbourne-based warehousemen and
manufacturers’ representative, has finally
pulled profits out of the dangerous nose-
dive they have been in for about four
years. In 1963-64, they rose from £2265
to £9852. The dive started in 1960-61,
when earnings slipped from 16.6 p.c. to
7.4 p.c. Then came a slide to 2.1 p.c.
and the low of 0.7 p.c. in 1962-63. Re-
covery has arrived and looks like con-
tinuing. Sales since balance date have
been rising steadily.
However, the dividend policy adopted
by the directors still seems a rather mis-

R.&N. STATHAM LIMITED
ADDRESS DELIVERED BY THE CHAIRMAN,
MR. N. M. STATHAM, AT THE
THIRD ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
OF SHAREHOLDERS HELD ON
NOVEMBER 27, 1964
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to welcome you here
today to the Third Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders, firstly, because
this is the first meeting to be held in the
company’s permanent home and, second-
ly, because the net profit for the year has
shown a gratifying increase.
RESULTS
I do not propose to deal in detail with
the balance sheet and accounts which
have been in your hands for the past
two weeks but instead I will point to
some of the highlights of the achieve-
ments of the past year.
Turnover of the company reached a
record level which was in excess of
£1,300,000 being a 33.7% increase over
the previous year’s sales figure. Such a
substantial rise in turnover could not have
been achieved without the complete
co-operation of all sections of the com-
pany's organisation, and I am pleased to
be able to record here the appreciation
of the Directors to each member of the
organisation who contributed to the pro-
gress of the company.
Whilst the increase in turnover resulted
in higher net earnings, it also brought
about increases in certain costs which
rose disproportionately to the increased
rate of sales. This was particularly evi-
dent in the cost of staffing the company’s
drawing office which is now set up to a
level where a further substantial increase
in business can be handled without addi-
tional rises in costs. Other sections of the
organisation, which are now geared to a
high peak of efficiency to give maxi-
mum service to clients, also experienced
rises in operating costs.
We are now sufficiently advanced into
the current financial year to know that
with goods already delivered and orders
on hand, a substantial increase in turn-
over will again occur.
All of the company’s divisions con-
tinued to expand during the year and
whereas production targets were set
earlier in the year under review, it be-
came necessary as the year progressed to
substantially increase the quotas which
had been set.
To keep pace with the increased
demand for the company’s products, the
network of country agents was increased
by forty during the year and the com-
pany now has over four hundred agents
covering the area of its operations. In
addition the company maintains a staff
of ten sales representatives who are
based in strategically located country
cities and towns from where they can
most effectively assist the country agents
to secure sales and provide a more satis-
factory service to clients.
The company also maintains three
building supervisors whose function is to
follow up the work of contractors to
ensure that all buildings and equipment
have been satisfactorily completed and I
might mention here, that this company
is the only one engaged in this type of
rural activity which provides such an
after sales service.
ACTIVITIES
I am sure that shareholders would be
interested to learn something of the
present activities of the company and
also of the already planned development
which' will occur during the next year.
Some of these matters have been refer-
red to briefly in the Directors’ Report
and I will endeavour to convey to you
some of the reasons for the decisions
which have been made.
The operations of the principal sub-
sidiary company, namely R. and N.
Trading Company Pty. Limited are
divided into a number of separate sec-
tions, each with its own experienced
and qualified manager.
Perhaps the most important of these,
particularly as to the company’s future,
is the Research and Development Depart-
ment in which a constant programme of
improvement of existing products and
development of new ones is carried out.
The wide acceptance of the company’s
range of rural equipment is a direct
result of the work carried out in this
section.
The sales organisation of the company
is divided into three main sections, the
largest of which handles rural equipment
such as shearing sheds, cattle yards,
sheep yards, and grain silos, etc. The next
largest is responsible for the sales and
service of Farmatic bulk handling equip-
ment which up to the present time has
been concentrated on serving the require-
ments of the wheat industry but which
will be developed during the coming year
to cater for a variety of industrial uses.
The industrial sales organisation is
concerned with the sale of industrial-type
buildings of a form which lend them-
selves to the production line techniques
developed by the company. It will be
interesting for shareholders to know that
the company does not tender for build-
ings which are so off-standard as to be
not suitable for mass production
methods. By this means the company
does not expose itself to many of the
risks which are inherent in tendering for
contracts.


The production section of the com-
pany includes a large drawing office and
all the facilities which are necessary for
large-scale assembly-line methods of
prefabrication of steel buildings and
numerous types of rural and other equip-
ment.
Manufacturing activities have now
become by far the largest section of
the company’s business and as a result it
has been necessary to increase factory
accommodation during the year. In fact
the factory has been enlarged twice dur-
ing the year under review and plans
for future extensions are on the draw-
ing boards at the present time.
R. and N. Trading Company Pty.
Limited also provides the administration
services for the group.
The other subsidiary at balancing date,
Northern Service Supplies Pty. Limited,
is principally a buying organisation and
also owns several of the company's free-
hold properties.
THE SEASONS
The past year has seen bountiful
seasons for the primary producer with
firm wheat and wool prices, with great
expansion in production which has been
responsible for the considerable increase
in Australia’s export income.
This prosperity has enabled the man
on the land to continually improve his
property and equipment and to develop
hitherto unproductive areas. The effects
of this are felt in all sections of Aus-
tralian commerce and industry because
the improvement in overseas balance of
funds has enabled both secondary and
tertiary industry to acquire and pay for
the raw materials and equipment which
are necessary for their development.
The wheat harvest which was origin-
ally estimated to be 120 million bushels
will now be, on the latest estimates of
the Wheat Board, 165 million bushels
and it is considered that this figure may
be exceeded when the harvest is com-
pleted.
The wheat growing season which is
just concluding has been the most
favourable one in recent years. A vast
number of storage and handling prob-
lems have emerged as a result and your
company is in the forefront of develop-
ments in this regard.
Whilst this current season has result-
ed in increased sales for the company,
it should be mentioned that the spread
of the company’s activities are such that
seasonal fluctuations do not have an ap-
preciable affect on sales activity. There
have been many periods of drought and
flood both of a local and more widespread
nature during the period in which the
company has been in existence but the
company’s experience has been that
whilst one particular area is affected
other areas are enjoying good seasons
and therefore sales have increased every
year since incorporation.
THE FUTURE
I believe that the future of Australia
holds a great potential for those with
the initiative and courage necessary to
undertake the tasks which lie ahead. A
great deal of hard work is required of
all of us if this country is to prosper
and to maintain its position, particularly
in relation to its neighbours in the near
East.
For our part, we intend that your
company will play a major part in the
continuing development of the rural and
industrial sections of the Australian com-
munity and in this belief we have already
undertaken further development which
will materially assist to improve the sta-
bility of the company. These new
developments are as follows: —
COOLAH TIMBER PTY. LIMITED
As previously advised this company
was acquired to alleviate the shortage of
good quality timber which the com-
pany is experiencing.
R. and N. Trading Company Pty.
Limited is a major consumer of timber
and uses approximately two million super
feet of Australian hardwood each year.
The log quotas which were acquired with
Coolah and Mudgee Mills will ensure
profitable operations even if all the out-
put were used by the company.
However, it is not the company’s
policy to unduly disturb the previously
existing marketing arrangements in these
areas where timber is scarce and there-
fore only about 70% of production will
be utilised by the company and the
balance will be available to an existing
and increasing outside market.
R. & N. ROLLING MILLS PTY. LTD.
The “Weatherlok” range of roofing
and walling materials has now been on
the market for just three weeks and
already substantial orders have been
delivered and more are on hand.
This company is equipped with the
most modern and versatile type of cold
roll forming machine in the Common-
wealth which was purchased after a
detailed investigation was made of simi-
lar types of mills obtainable from over-
seas.
This Australian manufactured mill is
equal to any available in the world today
and has many advantages over a large
number of imported machines.
New products are being introduced
and the first of these, a “Z” type steel
purlin, is currently under development.
These purlins are an important component
of the “alsteel’’ range of farm buildings
recently introduced by the company. This
product will also be available for sale
to outside markets.
The use of ‘'Weatherlok” by R. & N.
Trading Company Pty. Limited will be
in the vicinity of two million square feet
per year and the economies in this quan-
tity will ensure the profitability of this
company.
Negotiations are proceeding with the
aluminium industry the result of which
will be that the company will be licensed
to manufacture and distribute a wide
range of aluminium products. Many of
these products will be new to the Aus-
tralian market and will have application
within our own industry.
Whilst aluminium as a building
material will never supplant steel, I am
convinced that the use of aluminium
will greatly increase in the future. For
this reason it is the company’s policy to
keep abreast of the trends and develop-
ments in this industry.
(Continued on page 70)
The expanding headquarters of the R.&N. Statham organisation at Bennetts Green, near Newcastle.


A tremendous amount of research
work has been done by the aluminium
industry and it is anticipated that when
our arrangements are completed the
results of this will be available to the
company.
BRISBANE
Negotiations are still proceeding for
the extension of the company's activities
in Queensland and as soon as they are
completed appropriate announcements
will be made.
However, agreement has been reached
on the main aspects of the merger of
interests and it now remains for the
Queensland organisation to re-arrange
certain of its affairs so that final agree-
ment on all points can be reached.
The State of Queensland is going
through a period of great progress and
our market surveys indicate that with
the development of an effective selling
and manufacturing organisation, a sub-
stantial turnover in the company’s pro-
ducts can quickly be achieved.
As with every large-scale development
programme the main problem which
faced the Board was the need to provide
sufficient highly qualified executives to
enable the Brisbane venture to be self-
supporting both from the financial and
organisational viewpoints. The Board
therefore decided to merge with an exist-
ing company, which carries on a business
similar in many respects to that of R.
& N. Trading Company Pty. Limited.
The company concerned is a highly
organised, successful and well-respected
one and in the opinion of the Board
provides the most suitable means of
resolving the difficulties associated with
inter-state expansion.
SPIRAL FLIGHTING
MANUFACTURE
The company imports substantial
quantities of continuous spiral flighting
from the United Kingdom and Germany
for use in its range of bulk handling
equipment and is now about to under-
take the manufacture of this material.
Accordingly, after exhaustive enquiries,
an agreement has been concluded with
a leading United States manufacturer
for the provision of plans and working
drawings for the construction of a con-
tinuous helicoid spiral flighting machine.
Orders have been placed and the
machine will be producing early in the
new year. The capacity of the machine
is such that the full requirements of
the Australian market can be manufac-
tured as well as providing a surplus for
export.
As is the case with the timber mills
and the rolling mills, the company's own
internal consumption of spiral flighting
will generate sufficient profit to ensure
the financial success of this venture.
MOREE DEVELOPMENT
The company's existing factory is
working to peak capacity with all the
attendant problems of labour shortages,
etc., which can be expected in the period
of prosperity such as Australia is cur-
rently enjoying. This labour shortage in
The main administration block of the developing R.&
N. Statham group at Bennetts Green, near Newcastle.
my view will not be corrected for a long
time, mainly because the recently an-
nounced programme of industrial deve-
lopment and power generation for the
Newcastle and Hunter Valley region for
the next few years will tend to intensify
the already acute labour problems.
In addition to this the Board has felt
for some time that a suitably located
manufacturing unit in a country area
would help to improve the service which
is rendered to our clients.
Land has been acquired at Moree on
which it is proposed to establish a manu-
facturing unit and depot. This unit is
planned to manufacture certain small
types of equipment for which a great
demand exists in the surrounding area.
The depot will stock a full range of
the company’s products and will ensure
that prompt deliveries can be made to
customers. Cost savings will be effected
as a more even flow of production can
be arranged through the factory and
railway freighting arrangements can be
so organised as to result in the minimum
loss of time in loading. The matter of
lost time at the railway loading point
in Newcastle is of great concern to the
company and we are continually pressing
the Department for improved facilities.
CRANE MANUFACTURE
Nothing further can be said at this
time regarding the proposed manufac-
ture of cranes except to assure share-
holders that the crane which has been
selected for manufacture is the best of
its type and this division will develop
to a considerable degree.
R. & N. INDUSTRIAL ESTATE
This year will see much progress in
the development of the R. & N. In-
dustrial Estate. The company has ac-
quired some eleven acres of land adjoin-
ing the present holdings for the purpose
of bringing together a number of the
company’s sub-contractors. This scheme
has received the approval of the sub-
tractors and two of them will be located
at the Estate within the next four
months.
This grouping of manufacturers will
result in substantial savings in handling
costs of steel and other raw materials
and will also enable a greater degree of
supervision to be exercised.
CAPITAL
From all that I have said you can
see that a large amount of development
will take place during the next twelve
months. Much of this is bound up with
our existing business and will result in
profitable operations. In addition a num-
ber of products will be available for
sale on alternative markets and will in-
crease the spread of the company’s
activities.
The Board is considering the ways
and means of providing the finance both
for capital expenditure and working
capital, which will be needed to carry
out this programme of expansion and
as soon as decisions have been made
shareholders will be notified.
In the meantime it has been decided
to recommend to shareholders that the
Nominal Capital of the company be in-
creased from £500,000 to £1,000,000
and in accordance with the company’s
Articles of Association a Special Resolu-
tion of shareholders in general meeting
is required for this purpose. Notices con-
vening an Extraordinary General Meet-
ing of Shareholders will be forwarded
to shareholders at an early date.
DIRECTORATE
The company has been fortunate in
securing the services of the Hon. F. J.
Finnan, C.8.E., and T. E. F. Hughes,
Esq., Q.C., M.P., who have recently
joined the Board and on this occasion I
extend to them both a warm welcome
and our hope that their association with
the company will be a happy and lengthy
one.
BALANCE SHEET
I now formally move that the balance
sheet and accounts as printed be adopted
and recommend to you that the final
dividend as shown in the Directors’ Re-
port, namely 5%, be declared and paid
forthwith.

leading one. In 1960-61 and 1962-63
the final dividend was completely omit-
ted after the, payment of an interim.
Unfortunately this is to be the case for
1963-64 as well, but it is hoped that past
experience has prevented the burning of
too many fingers. No final will be dis-
tributed after the 5 p.c. interim of earlier
months.
This situation is made even more
serious by the fact that the interim actu-
ally represented a lift on the 4 p.c. of
1962-63.
It is high time that the directors took
a more responsible stand over their
policy. Such practices serve only to
depress market prices in the long run,
even if a slight rise is executed by
optimists when the interims are declared.
It is high time, also, for the battered
shareholders to say a few strong words
at the company’s annual meeting when
it finally comes around.
Sweet Tooth for Issues
T ife Savers (Australia) Ltd continues
" to sweeten its shareholders. First
there was a record profit. Then the news
that the company expects to increase its
share of the market. Now a bonus and
cash issue. The bonus is the sixth in
eight years. The cash issue is the second
new issue in four years.
Both issues will be made at the rate
of one-for-ten. The cash issue of ss.
shares carries a 15s. premium and will
finance expansion, according to chairman
Mr W. Kirby. The 16 p.c. dividend is
expected to be maintained on the higher
capital. The issues will lift paid capital
to £1,192,517. '
“Norman” Invasion
Brick shares could be worth
buying on the strength of a possible
return to the 12i p.c. dividend in the
current year. Teething troubles at a
new plant caused earnings reductions
during the 1963-64 year and, combined
with a few liquidity problems, they
necessitated a cut to 10 p.c.
Last week’s annual meeting revealed
that debt troubles have been substantially
reduced and that the new plant is
operating at a profit. Sales in the first
four months of the year have shown a
“marked improvement”.
But most important is a new brick
being produced, whose success could
boost profits above their former levels.
This is called a “Norman” brick —longer
and narrower than the standard item.
These have been produced in a variety
of colors and the directors are expect-
ing big things.

Floating Trucks
Something to gladden the hearts of patriotic Australian
investors has arrived with the news that the local branch
of the Leyland Motor Corporation will convert to a public
company in about two years and offer about 50 p.c. of the
capital to us natives. This handsome gesture is made more
than attractive because the company is already well-established
as one of our most successful manufacturers of heavy trucks
and buses.
The situation is undoubtedly mouth-watering to the numerous
investors who moan about the injustice of overseas owner-
ship and yet are not prepared to take the risks involved
in placing their money into such a company if it is only just
starting up. Leyland will produce itself to us on an already
successful silver plate.
The company came to Australia in 1925 and has prospered
ever since. Its trucks have around 40 p.c. local content and
this is to be increased. At present, expansion is being planned
for the works at Footscray (Vic.) and in Brisbane, too. There
is every chance that exporting will be undertaken in a major
way once flotation is finished. Most of this is currently the
job of the English parent, whose £stgl shares sell for about
555. stg.
Turnover of the whole group is about £stg2oo million every
year. Roughly 50,000 people are on the payroll. There are
60 associate and subsidiary companies throughout the world.
Flying High
/'Anly a pessimist would foretell a backward march on the
” part of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and Reginald
Myles Ansett, the chairman and managing director, cer-
tainly does not fall into that category. He told shareholders at
the annual meeting they could expect record results for the
current financial year, following a 17 p.c. growth over last
year in current capital city airlines passenger traffic.
This compared with an overall 14 p.c. rise in passenger
traffic last year, and an 11 p.c. rise in cargo revenue. No
doubt all of this will be aided by the Boeing 727 jets, one
of which the company now has operating. A second (and may-
be more) will be delivered at a later date. “In all our activi-
ties we see planned expansion and healthy growth which
will continue in the years ahead,” Mr Ansett said.
Other transport activities seem set for a good year too.
These include Ansett Pioneer, Ansett Freight Express, and
Ansair, the bus builder. Still involved in communications, Mr
Ansett said the group’s television station, Channel 0 in Mel-
bourne, was making considerable progress although Austarama
Television would incur losses in its first year of operations,
1964-65. However, it should contribute to overall profits in
the following financial year.
He also revealed that the group would make a £4 million
debenture issue (underwritten for £3 million by lan Potter
and Co., the balance of £1 million being placed with institu-
tions) for periods between 10 and 25 years.
Chemicals on Their Feet
HThe joint chemical company set up by Colonial Sugar and
the Dow Chemical group of Switzerland, CSRC-Dow Pty
Ltd, is at last finding its feet. In the year to June 30, it
scored a substantial lift in net profit from £41,000 to £192,000.
Earning rate on the slightly higher paid capital jumped from
a meagre 1.1 p.c. to a still low 5.2 p.c.
The result has put the enterprise well on its way to being
worthwhile, with accumulated losses enjoying a reduction to
around £226,000. The financial position shown by the balance
sheet is still rather precarious, although little weight can be
attached to this feature with two overseers of such a strong
nature. Current liabilities of £6.6 million are far in excess of
current assets at £1.4 million. There are no provisions shown
for paying off the difference in the next 12 months.
The company has been manufacturing styrene, ethylene,
dichloride, chloride and caustic soda at its Altona (Vic.) plant
since September, 1961. CSR’s interim report is due out this
week, so further statements can be expected on the pro-
gress of these chemical interests.
Mediocre Hattam
HThe prospectus from E. C. Hattam does not make the
chance of getting in on the public float look any more
attractive. However, as pointed out in last week’s issue (p. 70),
the Potter-AUC “seal of approval” will ensure the success
of the float, maybe even to the extent of over-subscription.
The most useful information revealed by the prospectus is
the earning rate on projected capital (13.3 p.c. last year
and 9.6 p.c. in 1962-63), the tangible asset backing (4s. lid.
a ss. share) and the fact that sales in the first three months
of the current year are substantially higher. These figures can
only be described as mediocre and little hedge against the
uninspiring image which many second-rate retailing companies
have built up of late.
The relative unattractiveness of the float is fully reflected in
the low floating price of ss. 6d. On the other hand, the low-
ness of this price and the prospect of 9 p.c. dividends alone
provide features which should guarantee full subscription.
The company owns 12 stores, specialising in clothing and
softgoods.
Unspectacular Spectacle
A U3TRALIAN AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCES’ spectacular
60 p.c. profit lift for 1963-64 is still not spectacular
enough for shareholders. Although they will collect a steady
73 p.c. dividend, the profit of £18,712 is equal to only 6.1
p.c. on capital. The dividend absorbs £23,180.
This is the fourth time in succession that the dividend has
been 73 p.c. and the third time in succession that it has been
uncovered. The rate was established in 1960-61, after profit
had touched a record £38,612. This figure was nearly halved
in the following year and fell again to £11,701 in 1962-63.
However, the draw on reserves has been kept at a minimum,
so the situation is not quite as bad as it appears. An
additional £6503 profit on the realisation of investments was
made in the latest year (this figure was £13,463 the year be-
fore).


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Justifying a High Status
Provincial Traders ' commendable growth rate
rpHE security analyst often has some
difficulty in deciding how certain
features in a company’s accounts should
be treated, even though he is well aware
of the conventional approach. In my
mind, the published accounts of Provin-
cial Traders Holdings Ltd present two
such problems.
For many years it has been standard
practice to treat “provisions for fluctua-
tion in stock values” as an appropriation
of profits rather than as a charge before
arriving at the actual profit. This is
particularly the case when stock has al-
ready been valued at the lower of cost
or market replacement value. It means
that, even if the company should deduct
such a provision from its net profit and
also from the stock figure in the balance
sheet, the analyst will add the figure back
to profit when making his calculations
and also transfer the provision in the bal-
ance sheet to shareholders’ funds. This
treatment has been followed in the figures
at the end of this article and it will be
noted that it has the effect of showing a
decline in profits in the 1963-64 year of
nearly 10 p.c. whereas according to the
published figures, the profit increased by
over 25 p.c.
More importantly, the trend in the
earning rate changes. Instead of showing
an upward trend from 1958-59 to
1962- (with a pronounced jump in
1963- the rate shows a rising trend to
1961-62, a slight fall in 1962-63 and
then a continuation of the upward trend
in 1963-64.
The second factor relates to the large
issues of convertible notes which were
made in 1958 and 1959. These issues
were large in relation to the capital then
on issue and, even after the new equity
issue to be made next year, these notes,
when they convert, will have the effect
of increasing equity capital by 42i p.c.
However, half of the notes on issue will
not convert until the first half of 1966
and the remainder not until the first half
of 1972.
'T'he customary approach with a com-
pany which has this type of capital
outstanding is to treat the convertible
notes as though they were already ordin-
ary capital and to add back to the earn-
ings the interest paid on the notes after
deducting income tax at the full standard
rate. The basis of this treatment is that
if the notes had been ordinary capital
then the interest would not have been
paid and would not have been available
as a tax deduction.
The effect of this particular adjustment
on the earning rate series is shown in
the following short table:
EARNING RATE %
Year to June 30 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
No adjustment for
''convertible notes 20.7 22.9 23.8 30.9 25.8
Adjusted 11.5 12.3 13.8 20.0 16.3
Clearly this makes very little difference
to the trend in fact when the series
is adjusted the rate of growth improves.
But it does make a substantial difference
in the absolute amount of earnings per
share.
The real effect of this adjustment is on
the price/earnings ratio. If the adjust-
ment is made, the price/earnings ratio,
on the basis of a price of 18s., becomes
21.6 instead of 14.0. For those who
prefer the earnings yield concept, the
earnings yield becomes 4.6 p.c. instead
of 7.2 p.c. As the adjustment has such a
marked effect, it would seem that many
who might have bought the stock be-
cause they felt that the earnings yield
was 7.2 p.c. would not have bought if
they had calculated the earnings yield to
be 4.6 p.c.
'T'he new issue to be raised early next
-*■ year will add about £536,000 to the
present paid ordinary capital of
£1,342,609. This means that the dividend
commitment will rise to about £lBB,OOO.
When the first issue of notes converts
in 1966 it will increase to £228,000 and
in 1972 it will become £268,000. Clearly,
even this latter figure is not going to
trouble the company, which earnt con-
siderably more than this figure in
1962-63 and in 1963-64 without the
benefit of the additional £500,000 and
without the benefit of the businesses of
McAleese and Co. and the unnamed firm
acquired by J. R. Wyllie and Sons Pty
Ltd in Mount Isa.
The question is whether the company,
with these rising dividend commitments,
can produce the additional rate of growth
necessary to justify the present price
being paid for the shares.
While the rate of growth that is being
anticipated by current prices is also a
matter of opinion, I will assume that
dividends per share are expected to in-
crease at the rate of 10 p.c. per annum
compound. This would mean that the
total dividend pay-out would need to be
about £366,000 by 1969 without any
increase at all in the present capital
(apart from the issue already announced)
and about £695,000 in 1974 on the same
basis.
Again, it is fairly clear that the first
objective is certainly capable of being
realised, because the amount of £366,000
is about the current level of earnings.
Whether the company would, in fact,
have a 100 p.c. pay-out is doubtful. No
clear relationship between dividends and
earnings has been established. For the
purpose of this exercise, it will be
assumed that the company would not
pay out more than 60 p.c. of its earnings.
This would mean that by 1969 earnings
would have to be about £610,000 and by
1974 about £1,160,000.
'T'he growth rates implicit in these
-*• figures are 12 p.c. for the first five
years and 13i p.c. for the next five years,
or 13 p.c. over the whole ten years. The
rate of growth in per share earnings over
the last five years on the basis of the
adjusted series would be just under
13 p.c. per annum compound.
This would suggest that the market has
been far more expert than I would nor-
mally have given it credit for and sug-
gests that the stock is correctly priced in
my estimation. There is, of course, no
margin for error, but there is quite a sub-
stantial allowance made when it is con-
sidered that on the basis of the adjust-
ments that I have mentioned earnings
were down quite considerably on the
1962-63 year. Therefore, the growth
period starts from what could well be
a low base.
It seems that Provincial Traders has
earned the high status currently given to
its shares by the market.

Involved with Food
High competition for Petersville
Petersville Australia Ltd is involved
in the Australian general foods in-
dustry to a greater extent than most in-
vestors realise. Ice-cream, the group’s
traditional product, is far less important
than it once was and its contribution to
profits is likely to continue diminishing.
Thus, although the nation’s market for
general foods is expanding, especially
frozen lines, the high and often danger-
ous competition which overshadows the
industry is a prime consideration for
those contemplating the investment pos-
sibilities offered by Petersville.
Local competition is stiff and growing.
Frozen Foods and Piet are two private
firms who have recently turned public
for expansionary cash. Australia’s attrac-
tiveness to overseas firms is also a threat.
Producers are in danger of being handi-
capped against further expansion by
imports, especially from countries with
better refrigerated shipping facilities.
Of course, as far as shareholders are
concerned, this situation puts them right
in line for making money on takeover
bids. Petersville itself has been the sub-
ject of many rumors. In August last
year, the 2s. shares touched their 1963
peak of 9s. 3d. on supposedly “informed”
buying. However, a successful bid for
the company is unlikely in the foreseeable
future. In the first place, an unusual
system of allocating votes to the 45 mil-
lion ordinary shares has been designed
to make success a virtual impossibility
without the full consent of directors.
Second, we have the dynamic chairman
and managing director, Mr Emil Christ-
ensen, who is violently opposed to non-
Australian ownership.
In fact, the importance and necessity
of keeping Australia Australian-owned
appears to be one of his strongest con-
victions. At a recent Press conference in
Melbourne, the group’s hometown, he
revealed that, while overseas, no less
than six approaches had been made in
his direction. He did not even bother
holding discussions with some of the
parties. This outlook explains why all
the Peters’ delivery trucks fly an Austra-
lian flag.
the majority of investors do not ap-
pear to appreciate the degree of invul-
nerability to takeover, the shares fre-
quently jump on market rumors. Because
of this, they carry a certain speculative
appeal. Following a poor 1963-64,
prices are now historically depressed and
the possibilities of new takeover rumors
are high because of this. So this specu-
lative appeal is stronger than usual just
now.
Another aspect of the current position
in the food industry is also worthy of
note. While Petersville itself may be able
to resist takeover, it has many competi-
tors who may appreciate a “quick quid”
at the expense of Australian control.
The competition provided by these could
become a serious threat, with big over-
seas finance backing up proceedings com-
bined with a determination to crash into
the Australian market.
Thus, it is obvious that the company’s
general food division will bear close
watching. At present, it contributes 30
p.c. of group profits. It includes the
Gordon Edgell company, Birds Eye, Hy-
Peak, Quick Frozen Food, Hygrade Food
Products, International Canners, R. E.
Cam and J. Hargreaves and Sons. The
ice-cream division contributes 40 p.c. of
annual profits and, apart from numerous
Peters’ subsidiaries, includes Festival
Foods, Koala Foods, and United Modern
Creameries.
HThe dairy division and the pastry foods
division contribute 124 p.c. each to
profits. The former includes the Holden-
son and Nielson group, Trafalgar Milk
Supply, Yarragon Dairy Company and
Willow Grove Farms. The pastry division
covers Four'n Twenty Pies, Wedgewood
products, and Scott's Taxi Vans which
are primarily engaged in pastry delivery.
Just last May, Petersville (Exports)
was incorporated to handle the group’s
growing overseas trade. Around 10 p.c.
of total turnover is exported to 72
countries at present. The establishment of
a special subsidiary reflects the potential
which exports offer the company, both
for tax purposes and for creating markets
which will prove valuable as local compe-
tition stiffens. As Australia’s largest local-
ly-owned food group, Petersville now
operates through 36 subsidiaries.
To put things in a nutshell, the group
produces ice-cream, butter, milk powder,
edible and commercial casein, pies and
pasties. It processes canned frozen and
baby foods. It also manufactures com-
mercial refrigerators and has agricultural
interests. One of these is potato grow-
ing in Tasmania. The International Can-
ners subsidiary processes them. Con-
siderable help in this field has come
from a technological exchange agreement
with J. R. Simplot Co., of Idaho in the
US, a multi-million dollar organisation
which is regarded as a world leader in
potato product manufacture and pro-
cessing. Exports are mainly canned and
frozen butter, milk powder, and casein.
The potato scheme is part of the
general food division. It was integration
trouble in this division that caused the
dismal 1963-64 result. Earning rate
came back from 18.7 p.c. to 12.9 p.c. to
provide a narrow cover for the 124 p.c.
dividend, reduced from the 15 p.c. rate
which had prevailed since 1953-54. The
earning rate was the lowest since the war
and probably the lowest since inception
in June, 1929, as the Peters American
Delicacy Co. Several factors in the food
division contributed to the catastrophe.
rp H E object of the integration was to cen-
tralise control of the activities of the
associated companies. Apart from the
initial and expected expenses on develop-
ing the potato project, losses were in-
curred on the disposal of frozen foods
previously held by major distributors,
consignment stock held by overseas
agents, and obsolete and unsuitable stocks
of labels, packaging and other materials.
These disposals were basically a result
of a change in marketing policy, which
involved the company in dispensing with
agents to carry out its own merchandi-
sing. Around £200,000 worth of Hy-
Peak stock had to be destroyed as below
quality when it was found that handling
agents had not rotated their incoming
deliveries properly, so that a lot of food
never found its way out of the storeroom.
The efficient and closely controlled run-
ning of a storeroom is imperative if
perishable goods are to be looked after
and sold profitably.
Most of another £lOO,OOO-odd was in-
curred in moving to a new factory in a
specially created suburb, Petersville, near
Springvale and the Monash University.
During this time, the old factory at Burn-
ley was kept in operation and helped in-
crease the cost burden of moving house.
So, in total, £300,000 in losses and ex-
penses can be considered abnormal and
non-recurring. Adding this back on to
the £579,000 result, we find that, under
normal circumstances, the group would
have improved on the 1963 figure of
£833,000, maintained earning rate and
held dividend.
It is towards this level that directors
have budgeted for the current year. At
the annual meeting on October 28, Mr
Christensen told shareholders that profit
and sales in the first quarter were in line
with this budget, so all looks well and
there is a distinct chance of a restored
dividend. However, seasonal factors
could well hamper or help recovery.
Their effect on turnover, especially in the
ice-cream division, is obvious. They
can also affect the supply of foods for
processing and freezing. So far this year,
there has been little trouble of note.
Victorian ice-cream output will bene-
fit substantially this year from the new


centre at Petersville. Modern equipment
and facilities, combined with high inte-
gration, should bring about much better
profits. The dairy division should also
perform better as it is now more efficient
after a minor integration project and the
selling-off of some uneconomical fac-
tories. The pastry division has been do-
ing well, although higher meat prices
have kept profits down, as they did last
year. The general foods recovery will
be aided by two distributing companies
which have been acquired to reinforce
and expand distribution in Wollongong
and Canberra.
Exports will, of course, continue—
expansion here, as in Australia itself, is
hampered by competition from countries
with superior refrigerated shipping faci-
lities. Without the Government export
incentive scheme, it would be very diffi-
cult for the group to develop exports to
any great extent. Tax savings and in-
vestment allowances for plant enabled a
very low 1963-64 tax provision. The
amount payable in 1964-65 will be one
of the main factors affecting the extent
of the group's imminent recovery.
The erratic jumping of the figures in
the accompanying table reflects the rapid
expansion and diversification by takeover
since 1959, when ice-cream production
was just about the only activity. The
decline in current assets this year is
mainly a result of the change in market-
ing policy. As current liabilities have
eased too, working capital remains steady
and reasonably healthy. Rapid expan-
sion has meant rapid fixed asset and
depreciation growth. It has also boosted
ordinary capital every year, on which
earnings and dividend were well main-
tained up until 1963-64.
Perhaps the growth in loan capital is
the one worrying feature of the balance
sheet. Although this seems to be part of
a general trend, a company which is likely
to meet fierce competition in the years
ahead should be very wary of creating
too many prior charges on profits. So
many ifs and buts face the company
that it is a little hard for a critical inves-
tor to share the avid faith and enthusi-
asm held for the future by Mr Christen-
sen. As it is, the share price trend since
diversification started shows the com-
pany’s lowered status on the markets.
By status here, we mean money-
making status. At present, the chances
of an issue seem very remote. The last
two were both in 1961-62, a one-for-five
at a 2s. 6d. premium and a 15-for-100
bonus. A big gap exists between these
two issues and the previous two, both
one-for-one at par made in 1954-55 and
1955-56. Although reserves have grown
every year and now exceed paid capital,
there is little chance for another bonus
until earnings top 20 p.c. When and if
this will happen is anybody’s guess.
As far as the long or even medium
term is concerned, there are more pre-
dictable propositions than Petersville
shares. However, they should be worth
examination on the strength of the 1964-
65 recovery and a possible return to 15
p.c. dividends. At the present price of
about ss. 9d., they yield a reasonable
4.4 p.c. Although this price is high
(nearly three times par), it is still low in
that it is below 10s. —a hundred shares
would cost only £3O with brokerage, thus
making the scrip attainable by almost any
investor.
The long run outlook is less clear.
Briefly, it boils down to this. If Peters
can withstand heavy competition and
maintain its market percentages, the
benefits will be big, both to shareholders
and the company. If not, then a run-of-
the-mill status or even something worse
may result. To a large extent, the future
course depends on the management. At
present it is excellent, but without Mr
Christensen at the helm it may prove
somewhat different. He is undoubtedly
the driving force and the man of ideas.
Will his eventual loss prove catastrophic?
This depends on whom he chooses to
replace him.

TURNER INDUSTRIES LTD
Reorganised Just in Time
At the current price of 4s. 6d. the ss.
shares of Turner Industries offer
speculative possibilities more than any-
thing else. In the short-term, that is.
After heavy losses in the 1963-64 year
and a reorganisation which went right
through from management to the pruning
of unprofitable products and the installa-
tion of an electronic data process, the
stage is set for a comeback to profits this
year.
There is little doubt that success will
greet all the effort. For July, August
and September, all divisions operated
profitably according to the chairman, Mr
Raynes Dickson, at the annual meeting.
In fact, profits exceeded budget targets.
But the question of a return to dividends
is the vital one for speculators. Current
prices could yield handsome capital pro-
fits if an interim pay-out was declared, or
even if a dividend-paying decision was
left until the end of the year. Without a
dividend, gains would be small and a
speculator's money could be better placed
elsewhere.
For the longer-viewing investor, the
scrip holds definite possibilities, although
it would be wise to hold off any buying
until some actual figures are available.
These may come with the interim report,
as in 1963-64. If profit is stated, it must
be remembered that the reorganisation
plans will not take full effect until the
latter six months of the current year.
However, if it appears that the group is
moving toward its earlier profitability,
buying to hold would prove advantageous
even if prices have already risen. Turner
has always been a constant and generous
dividend payer, and a regular issuer of
shares.
There have been six shareholders’
issues since 1951-52, all at par except for
a one-for-two premium move in 1960-61.
The most recent was a one-for-four in
1962-63. There were one-for-two issues
in 1956-57, 1954-55, and 1950-51, which
also saw a one-for-five. Until the 8 p.c.
dividend in 1962-63, and the nil pay-out
in 1963-64, distributions had been 10 p.c.
since 1957. From 1954 to 1959, inclu-
sive, earnings averaged between 20 p.c.
and 24 p.c. The pattern since then has
been erratic (see table).
On the possibilities of a dividend this
year, it’s necessary to tread very lightly.
The interim report will be the best indi-
cator. As long as the recovery has
gone far enough to produce a respect-
able earning rate, a payout is likely, as,
at present, there seems to be little need to
build up liquid funds. As the directors
will no doubt see virtue in deferring any
dividend until the end of the year, the
interim report should at least reveal what
the profit is. The fact remains that, had
directors revealed what they were budget-
ing for, much of the doubt now sur-
rounding the shares would be removed.
As it is, “profits exceeding budget” is a
statement of only minor help if the
budget figure remains unrevealed.
The group operates through six sub-
sidiaries, one being of NSW incorpora-
tion. The parent acts purely as a hold-
ing company from the head office in
Nunawading, on the outskirts of subur-
ban Melbourne. A four-acre site there is
the main property and is fully developed.

Twenty-five acres at Lily dale are partly
developed. Properties are also owned in
Townsville, Brisbane and Adelaide. From
Lilydale and Nunawading, the group pro-
duces motor mowers, builders’ and furni-
ture hardware, screwdrivers, planes,
levels, hacksaw frames, trimming knives,
gardening tools, industrial shovels, hack-
saws, bandsaws, chainsaws, and general
hardware. Production of washing
machines, clothes driers, and floor polish-
ers stopped last August.
Turner Manufacturing Co. produces
and markets hardware, tools and appli-
ances and carries out the marketing func-
tion for Turner-Atkins Saws. Turner-
Atkins Saws handles saw production from
the Lilydale plant. Turner-Lufkin was
set up in co-operation with a US com-
pany to manufacture measuring tapes.
The NSW subsidiary, Hacksaws (Aust.)
deals with its name product. Forgecraft
Manufacturing, formerly of South Mel-
bourne, has had its domestic and tailors’
scissors manufacturing business trans-
ferred to Nunawading.
Turner International handles the
group’s exports, at present going to 35
countries. Export sales totalled £300,000
in 1963-64, just a small portion of the
total £3.6 million turnover. Increases are
expected this year now that delivery pro-
blems from Turner Manufacturing have
been overcome, thanks to a new method
of production planning.
1963-64 £52,000 loss was a direct
result of the £llO,OOO lost in the
appliance and service divisions of Turner
Manufacturing. Profits in the hardware
and tool divisions were lower. The two
saw companies and the exporting sub-
sidiary all made profits, hence the
£16,000 tax provision. Actually, the loss
could be boosted to £165,000 by inclu-
ding the £3OOO in preference dividends
and £llO,OOO of asset write-downs in-
volved in the reorganisation, both of
which were deducted from the profit and
loss appropriation account.
This move accounts for the decreased
reserves in the table. They had grown
steadily every previous year. It also put
the appropriation account back into
debit to the extent of £66,000.
Several innovations should assist re-
covery this year and permit the move to
more profitable lines. Direct costing
has been installed and improved budget-
ing control methods completed. A new
financial accounting system enables more
current and comprehensive reports on
actual achievement, compared with
budget objectives. Basic sales and in-
ventory statistics will be provided by
electronic data processing.
In 1963-64 sales of hardware rose
6 p.c., hand tools 23 p.c., garden tools
30 p.c. and saws 15 p.c. It is hoped this
year that reorganisation will combat com-
petition and control manufacturing costs,
both of which reduced profitability last
year despite the higher sales. Unprofit-
able lines have been excluded from the
ranges and the selling price of others
adjusted up or down accordingly.
weather conditions hampered
motor-mower sales in 1963-64, but
the company maintained its share of the
market. For 1964-65 there as six models
and budgets are being met. A full year’s
marketing of the new door closers and
spirit levels will help results as well as
better weather conditions. Screwdriver
sales are rising despite heavier compe-
tition and all saw sales are pointing up.
So, all in all, recovery seems inevitable.
Only its extent is the nagging and uncer-
tain question. It is fortunate that a fairly
strong financial position, despite last
year’s setbacks, has precluded any great
monetary problems. Asset backing for
each share is now 6s. 6d., compared with
7s. Id. at June 30, 1963.
The working capital situation is
healthy, revealing a current assets to cur-
rent liabilities ratio of 1.7 to 1. Fixed
assets should resume their steady growth
rate again this year. Intangibles continue
to be written down to negligible figures.
Shareholders’ reserves are still substantial
despite the setback, and loan capital gives
little worry—its reduction in 1963-64 is
an encouraging sign.
The erratic earning rate and post-
dividend profit surplus histories reflect
only too well that capital has been
doubled since 1960 and that the com-
pany has come through a very rough
patch. Even allowing for the credit
squeeze, it is quite obvious that reorgani-
sation is by no means ahead of its time.
The tumbling share price trend illustrates
that, with eventual complete recovery,
Turner scrip will be worth considerably
more than it is today.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Some Interesting Documents
An annual report and a prospectus
TI/lost annual reports make interesting
reading, especially ones like Marcus
Clark. The directors initially wrote off
£245,000 for bad debts against income,
to give a loss of £214,000. In fact this
was only a small part of the total loss.
For later on they tell us of a transfer of
£501,000 from existing reserves to the
provision for doubtful debts, building up
the balance there to the immense figure
of £731,000. Such a transfer would
almost have eliminated the profits for
the previous four years. In this period,
dividends equal to almost half the capital
have been paid.
One of the basic rules in accounting
is the distinction between capital and
revenue items. Marcus Clark may have
won the balance sheet award. This does
not necessarily mean that its accounts
are a model for accounting procedure.
Another document to arrive on my
desk this week was the Nuttall Holdings
Ltd prospectus. This is the first issue
made in Australia where the tender
system has been used. Looking at the
earnings, the minimum price of Bs. 3d.
is pitched fairly closely to the market.
The usual system of underwriting has
generally played very much into the
hands of the underwriting broker’s
clients. Such sure floats as John Lysaght
and United Telecasters proved a stag’s
delight. (Incidentally, I wonder how
United Telecasters would go if they tried
to float off again!) Where the terms of
an issue are weighted too favorably for
the hands of the broker’s clients, it is to
the detriment of the company and the
owners of that company.
The tender system overcomes this
shortcoming. However, in the case of
Nuttall Holdings half the profit goes to
the underwriting broker’s investment
company. So much for free enterprise!
It’s my guess that the successful price
will be 10s. 3d. It probably would be
higher if the market had any life in it.
If the market is going to remain
apathetic then it seems more appropriate
to be shorting rather than going long.
Thus it was that I sold 500 Marrickville
Holdings at 17s. 9d.
Although the stock has consistently
sold above 19s. for some years, the static
earning rate of about 20 p.c. for the
last five years would not seem to justify
such a price. This year’s profit showed
a rise of £7OO to £612,800. Obviously
more significant was the £75,000 fall
in the tax provision to £409,100. If an
adjustment is made for the change in tax
rates, this difference in tax provisions
would be a cool £lOO,OOO.
The shares did fall away to 165., but
then reacted to 17s. 9d. May this re-
action prove only temporary.
On the debit side of the account this
week was the purchase of 1000 Auto-
motive Components at 7s. 6d. Directors
seem pretty confident of getting other
bids, following the Repco offer. So
they’re playing cagey by not making any
announcement until the middle of the
month.
The first sale this week was King
Island Scheelite at 14s. With the 6d.
dividend thrown in I showed a nice
little profit of £29. The other sale,
Ansett notes, proved to be a break-even
proposition.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
1000 Ansett notes, 6/9 £326
500 Marrickville Hldgs, 17/9 £435
400 King Island Scheelite, 14/- £283
BOUGHT
1000 Auto. Components, 7/6 .... £385
The credit balance is up to £999.
Next week is balance time and also
a time for substantial liquidation but
more of that in my annual report.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
War Threats and Wool Price
Other reasons for the market slump
/"\ne of the cherished beliefs of a good
” many older woolgrowers is that in
times when war is threatened the price
of wool goes up. Doubtless the same
view was once shared by harness makers,
horse breeders and hides merchants.
Some months ago now this writer said
that there could never be another year
like 1950-51, when the Korean War
pushed wool prices to their all-time
record high. And, to be quite honest
about it, he considered the possibility that
he might have been sticking his neck
out. At this moment the prediction
seems more certain than ever.
The Vietnam war is “escalating”; the
Malaysian dispute seems likely to get
worse instead of better, and the Austra-
lian Government has proposed a selective
conscription scheme.
The wool market is both depressed and
depressing, despite the mounting threat
of war. Catalogues which were bringing
£96 a bale in November last year are
selling for £7B. The fall in prices since
the beginning of the season is about
8 p.c. for merino and 10 p.c. for come-
backs and crossbreds. Let us hope it
is temporary, but there clearly is a loss
of confidence in the stability of the
market.
The main reason for the slump is the
fact that Japanese buyers are not domi-
nating the market to the extent they were
earlier in the season. Reliable sources in
Japan say that Japanese textile manu-
facturers are going in heavily for diver-
sification. They are putting money into
tenpin bowling alleys, supermarkets,
electrical goods manufacturing, and other
consumer and entertainment avenues.
T'wo factors which may be provoking
this rush to diversify are home-based
Japanese economic difficulties and the
embryo US-inspired world textiles agree-
ment. The impact of this agreement,
should it come to fruition, is feared by
Japanese manufacturers. Sixty p.c. of
Japan’s woollen textiles exports go to
USA. If the US “agreement” means
higher protective tariffs for the revita-
lised (through automation) US industry,
they have good reason for their fears.
Japan, as everyone knows, has made
enormous strides since the war, and,
as visitors to the Olympic Games know,
the cost structure is beginning to sky-
rocket. Labor is making greater demands
for its share of the wealth and there are
overseas balance -of - payments difficul-
ties. Everyone, including Australia,
seems more eager to sell to Japan than
to buy from her. More than one Aus-
tralian businessman has returned from
Japan recently with the conviction that a
bust-up is looming.
Only a Jeremiah would transfer this
into a potential catastrophe for Austra-
lian wool. There are other markets. At
this stage the prospects appear simply as
depressing, not necessarily worse than
that.
k dding to the overall picture is the fact
that it now seems likely that the
1964-65 wool clip will be smaller than
at first thought. The National Council
of Woolselling Brokers states that to
October 31, a total of 1,462,471 bales
was sold compared with 1,585,214 in the
same period last year.
Proceeds from the sale of wool in the
four-month period were £115,140,182 —
about 15 p.c. down on the £134,823,360
received in the July-October period last
year. Moreover, the average net weight
of a bale, 305.56 lb, was almost 61b
lighter than last year.
A full-scale revision is now being
undertaken by the Woolselling Brokers
into the wool clip estimate. One en-
couraging aspect is that part of the de-
cline can be attributed to later shearing
in some States this year. But, other than
these things, the most depressing thing
about the wool industry at the present
time is the amount of money lent out by
the pastoral houses to woolgrowers. If
prices continue to slide, a lot of wool-
growers are going to be in real trouble.
In his annual report, the chairman of
Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort, Sir
Philip Mcßride, revealed that total Aus-
tralian advances at September 30 last
stood at a record £126.2 million. This
is money loaned out —usually at a frac-
tion over bank interest rates —to cover
operating costs until the wool cheque
comes in.
It has been a normal practice of the
pastoral houses to do this sort of thing
for nearly 70 years and, indeed, the
pastoralist-banker has contributed much
to the growth of the Australian wool
industry. Some long-term loans are
made, of course, but it would be safe
to say that the bulk would be against
the coming wool cheque. It would also
be safe to say probably that Elders GM
and the main opposition, Dalgety NZL,
have out about half the £126.2 million.
Three-quarters would be from these
two plus Australian Estates, Winchcombe
Carson, AML and F, Younghusband,
Dennys Lascelles, Gippsland and North-
ern, Pitt Son and Badgery, and A. G.
Webster. The remainder would be
spread amongst smaller firms of which,
in all, there are 27. The £126.2 million
works out at an average of roughly
£lOOO per individual woolgrower, though,
of course, it would not be this way at all.
Neither the very big nor the very
small grower is likely to be the heaviest
borrower. He is more likely to be the
smaller grower in the process of be-
coming bigger—the fellow of initiative
and enterprise whom the industry needs.
Everyone agrees that the industry needs
more wool and more wool will not come


from thp ultra-conservative or the un-
imaginative grower.
While it may not be entirely valid,
let us relate this matter to averages. Let
us say that the average grower has bor-
rowed £lOOO from his pastoral house
and let us say that he produces 50 bales
of wool (this figure is often accepted as
the average).
Last year he would have got about
£5OOO for his wool and his operating
costs would have been about £3OOO. He
would have cleared about £2OOO. Now,
this year, he owes £lOOO, his costs are
likely to be up £250 at least, and his
wool cheque could be down, hypotheti-
cally, £750. He gets no profit at all.
This is a very simplified example but
it indicates what could happen. For
some growers, who are in deeply, it
could be a lot worse.
Sir Philip Mcßride, in his annual re-
port, stated clearly that, as far as Elders
GM are concerned, the woolgrower
should make up his own mind about the
Wool Board's reserve price marketing
scheme. Whatever the woolgrower de-
cides, Sir Philip’s company, in his own
words, “will co-operate to the fullest
degree and will play our part in making
whatever plan is decided upon work”.
This attitude, coming from a pastoral
house which, with Dalgety NZL, handles
about half the total clip, is at variance
with some of the expressed attitudes of
smaller pastoral houses who hold the
reserve price plan in disfavor. Not too
much weight should be given to the fact
that Sir Philip Mcßride has a son, Mr
P. A. Mcßride, sitting on the Wool
Board.
In the final analysis, the average wool-
grower is likely to favor whichever
method of selling wool puts the most
money in his own pocket. The current
spate of accusation and counter-accusa-
tion, by both sides in the dispute, up to
and including the challenge to the wool
promotion levy in the courts which is
pending, may in the long run prove irre-
levant. That side which can provide the
soundest financial argument, and which
can show the woolgrower how to best
keep out of the red, will win.
Progeny Testing of Cattle
British, US and Australian attitudes
Tn farming the most spectacular crashes
A do not always happen in the case
of the lazy, inefficient fellow. The chap
who rushes in too early, and too en-
thusiastically, can quite easily come a
cropper if the particular idea he fastens
on to does not bear fruit. The man who
follows the middle of the road does best
in the long run.
This may not be an ideal situation, but
it is, nevertheless, a pretty accurate
description of what does happen. Many
many farmers who have been “bitten by
a bug” will attest to it. Nearly all suc-
cessful farmers temper their enthusiasm
with caution.
One of the most potent “bugs” on the
Australian farming scene at present is
the performance testing, or progeny test-
ing, of cattle. Basically this means that
animals are selected for breeding not
on appearance, or “by eye”, but by
keeping records of such things as rate
of weight gain, rate of body growth, and
rapidity of development. The aim,
generally speaking, is to have a beef
animal ready for slaughtering at 18
months or thereabouts and with a mini-
mum of unprofitable fat.
As might be expected, Australia is be-
hind the US and Britain in performance
testing. Therefore it is of interest that
attitudes in both these countries have
been changing somewhat.
The Americans found that while they
could produce the best beef in the world
it cost more and more to do so. This is
not really a valid argument against per-
formance testing, but rather a criticism
of the feedlot costs structure, which was
allowed to develop in the United States
in the belief that the public would pay
for quality regardless of price. But in
an all-out drive now to prune costs some
of the more lavish performance recording
operations in the US seem likely to be
curtailed.
British farmers, watching the troubles
besetting the US beef industry from 1962
onwards, adopted a more cautious attitude
to performance testing. Instead of rush-
ing headlong themselves, they were con-
tent to observe the results of perform-
ance testing carried out by institutes and
research farms sponsored by the Govern-
ment and breeders’ organisations.
Last month the results of four years
of official performance testing became
available in Britain. The four years of
trials definitely underline the need for
caution. It seems quite clear that per-
formance testing can detect the worst
bulls, but not necessarily the best bulls.
The British results show that weedy,
poor-doing bulls produce the slowest
growing offspring. Well, blind Dick
could tell you thatl
Disconcertingly, to the enthusiasts, the
tests also show that growth rate in off-
spring does not necessarily match growth
rate in the sire. Really outstanding pro-
geny groups are not always sired by bulls
rated as outstanding by the same per-
formance testing methods.
The report does indicate that the study
of weight gain characteristics is not a
waste of time, which is fair enough.
But the middle-of-the-road farmer will
naturally be inclined to let someone else
pay for it.
What is the position in Australia?
A symposium on beef breeding was
held recently at Melbourne University
and performance testing figured pro-
minently in the discussions.
One speaker, Mr R. M. Carraill, went
all out for performance testing. Until
the Australian beef industry had an
organised programme of performance
recording, to produce the factual data
essential in the development of breeding
plans, it would be at a considerable dis-
advantage, he said. Stud breeders could
actively encourage the development of
performance recording services. This
could be in keeping with breed society
objectives.
The present function of compiling herd
books was laborious and costly. The
value of registration, when related to
genetic progress, was questionable.
Alternatively, breeders could form im-
provement associations, run by them-
selves, and employing technical staff to
compile and analyse records.
Mr Carraill referred to the general
practice of force-feeding young show
stock. This, he said, could mean that
owners were simply selecting animals on
the basis of a large appetite. It could
also mean owners were encouraging
structural unsoundness and temporary
infertility. Breeders must make a re-
appraisal of their objectives so that their
efforts could be directed towards a more
realistic goal.
A middle-of-the-road stud breeder, at
the symposium, then took the floor. Mr
John Garnock, of “South Bukalong”,
Bombala, said that he had been per-
formance testing his cattle since 1955,
but that “the big mistake made in
America with performance recording is
being made in Australia”. He said: “The
real development of performance record- .
ing in Americ'a began when it was
adopted by the commercial breeder who,
by demand, forced the stud breeder to
adopt it or lose sales.”
Mr Garnock said the greatest difficulty
in performance recording was the full
and accurate processing of records. A
centralised agency, making use of an
electronic computer, did this in America.
The same system might eventually pre-
vail in Australia.
The symposium then heard from Mr
J. R. Allen, of “South Boorook”, Mort-
lake, who happens to be probably the
most successful individual beef breeder
of all time in this country. Mr Allen
said there would be no improvement in
commercial herds if there was none in
the studs. He said it was difficult to

said these records included the sire and
dam of a calf, the number of services
needed for each calf and any treatment
necessary. Records of sires included a
monthly record of weight. (These weight
recordings are similar to, but not as
exhaustive as, those demanded by per-
formance recording enthusiasts.)
He then went on to say that a
“memory picture” of ancestors and the
ability to recognise top animals were
combined with records in selecting for a
breeding programme.
Mr Allen said the scientist could be a
great help to the breeder, but the scientist
should work with, and not against, the
breeder. He said scientists appeared in-
terested only in quantity and not quality.
He urged scientists to spend more time
on investigating the problems associated
with nutrition, bloat, various diseases and
infertility. They might well leave the
business of breeding top animals to the
stud breeders. The finished beast was
the most important test —not measure-
ments taken between this stage and birth.
So there it is. Three different opinions
—not always diverging—and each pro-
vocative in certain aspects.
This writer humbly suggests that the
proper time to consider these views is
while thoughtfully chewing on a piece
of steak bought from the butcher, or
alternatively, the local supermarket. And
before tucking in, ascertain from the
woman of the house just how much it
cost. For the vast majority of people
that is the real performance test.
Esperance and Foreign Capital
A signpost for Ord development?
IjHHERE are rumblings in Esperance
about the extent to which David
Rockefeller, Art Linkletter and other US
millionaires have got control of areas
far in excess of the 2000 acres allocated
to most of the new settlers.
The “land-rush” phase at Esperance
seems to be over. Land now is very hard
to get. Most of the available land is in
the hands of the Esperance Land and
Development Co., which is an American
concern.
Under a 1960 agreement with the WA
Government, the company acquired some
1,450,000 acres at a price of about five
“I can't blame Alfred all he did was pay cash for the TV set."
shillings an acre. It is developing this
land into about 500 farms. Eleven such
farms were sold a few weeks ago by
auction —and realised £76,000 or ap-
proximately £7OOO each. This works out
at £3B an acre.
The company claims it costs £2O an
acre to develop the land (bought origi-
nally for five shillings), so that its pro-
fit is about £lB an acre. On this basis,
the Esperance Land and Development
Co. will get its money back a lot quicker
than the farmers. But then it put more
in than any farmer could hope to —about
£l£ million.
So far it has sold a total of 53 farms,
at prices ranging from £7OOO up to
£12,000 depending on the stage of deve-
lopment.
Many eastern States farmers, and sons
of eastern States farmers, travel overland
to Esperance to see what is going on.
Many say that they would be prepared to
develop their own blocks if they could
get them for five shillings an acre. But
what five shillings an acre land there is,
that is suitable, is already in the hands of
the US company.
Over and above this, the farmers are
critical of the way in which the company
has sold parcels of up to eight blocks to
millionaires such as Rockefeller and
Linkletter—and some Australian ones
too. As they are Australians, naturally,
the criticism is not as harsh.
The method adopted by the WA
Government at least does get develop-
ment moving, even though there is al-
ways the chance that the system may
turn into something not originally in-
tended.
There is so much development that
could be done in the eastern States, and
so many potential farmers lacking only
reasonable capital, that it might very
well be sound policy to leave the remoter
parts such as Esperance, the Ord and the
Northern Territory entirely to the big
fellow. Entirely implies keeping tax-
payers’ money out of such schemes.

He’s probably the most responsible goose in the
world. He’s the leader of a gaggle of white geese-70
in all-whose primary job in life is to help guard the
thousands of casks of Scotch whisky destined to
mature into Ballantine’s.
At Dumbarton, the 42 whiskies, mostly from the
Highlands, that will eventually blend into Ballan-
tine’s lie racked in the vast warehouses.
You can see them there, on invitation. But don’t
wander there alone or you’ll be met with a series of
loud, terrifyingly shrill cackles guaranteed to turn
your heels in the opposite direction.
Why do Ballantine’s take such trouble to protect
their whisky? If you drink Ballantine’s you’ll know
why. If you don’t,and still want the answer, try it!
THE MORE YOU KNOW ABOUT SCOTCH, THE MORE YOU LIKE BALLANTINE’S
