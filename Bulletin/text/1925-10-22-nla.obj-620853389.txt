Australian Playwrights
A few months ago Arthur Adams gave
us a somewhat pessimistic account of. his
experiences as an Australian playwright
He stated that there is no encouragement
given to local dramatic talent. He was per-
fectly correct. The two great firms are both
contracted for four or five years ahead,
mostly with American productions. In addi-
tion to this, all the theatres are under their
control. Hugh J. Ward openly and without
hesitation says he is bound by these con-
tracts, and it is only waste of time submit-
ting plays to him. This is refreshingly
straight talk. Another manager has another
method of acquainting an aspiring play-
wright with the fact that his goods are not
required. He smilingly takes the script anc
promises to give it his best and immediate
consideration. And then.... he loses it
Eventually, after six months, a perfunctory
hearing was given to a play—in this case an
opera, the music by a well-known experi-
enced Sydney musician. It was turnec
down because the chorus could not sing it
as it wa.s “too high set” ! Apart from the
fact that there is, such a thing as transposi-
tion, as carefully compared with works oi
Sullivan and others the setting was actually
lower. Mr. Adams is quite right. Austra-
lian dramatic talent is at a discount.
But it was not thus in the days of Wil-
liamson, Musgrove, George Rignold and
other managers of that period. I can write
from personal experience. George Musgrove,
whom I had frequently met in Melbourne,
and who knew that I had perpetrated a
“shilling shocker” entitled “Euchred ” and
was a contributor to the old Melbourne
Punch, stopped me one day near Poverty
Corner and asked me if I would care to
write a pantomime in collaboration with
Teddy Boyce, who was then winning the
hearts of Sydney audiences as Blueskm in
“Little Jack Sheppard.” The result was
“Aladdin,” with Jennie Lee (Joe) in the
name-part.
To work with Boyce was an education in
stagecraft. Unlike many comedians, he was
as amusing “off” as he was “on.” One of
his favorite yarns was that he had been
stranded somewhere in the Highlands, and
he and another member of the company had
to tramp and beg their way to Glasgow.
Arriving in front of the home of his Scotch
comrade in misfortune, Teddy shook hands
with him, saying, “Well, we’ve been through
a rough time together, old man. Good-bye
and better luck!” “The same to you,” was
the reply; “and, man” (as he stood at the
open door and waved a Scotch note), “I’ve
saved me pun’!” Boyce vised to swear a
good deal at rehearsals. Being squeamish
about “language,” especially before ladies,
I remonstrated with him one day as we
returned to St. Mary’s Terrace, after a par-
ticularly “warm” morning. “Well,” he
admitted. “I know it’s not quite the thing
to do. But I must let out somehow. What
on earth can I say?” I had an idea. “Let
out.” I said, “the first silliest Avords you think
of.” “Bight,” he cried, “I will.” And next
morning, when he was timing the complicated
evolutions of a Processional March—one,
two, three, four cZapstick—-something went
wrong. “What the” all awaited a tor-
rent of vitriolic lava. “What the”—a look
at me—-.“grandmother’s aunt pot-kettle jam-
fin are you doing?” It did just as well as
the “language,” put us and him in a good
humor, and the rehearsal went on smoothly.
The pantomime was a great success, and the
first-act curtain descended and ascended again
and again. I must have possessed a sort of
.Tules Vernian, Wellsian prophetic instinct,
for I had ended the act Avith Jennie Lee as
Aladdin receiving a telegram from Henry
Parkes that the Australian colonies were
going to be united. She gave a “Hooray!”
jumped into an aeroplane or airship and sang
Avith the chorus as she went up;—
United Australia, united and free!
Forward and united shall our watchword be.
Forward, ever marching, and one from sea to sea.
Forward, united Australia.
But to return to our shorn sheep—Aus-
tralian playwrights. As an instance of the
difference of attitude maintained by man-
agers of the ’eighties and ’nineties compared
with that of to-day, let me tell how I was
treated by J. C. Williamson when I requested
a “hearing” of a burlesque I had written, at
the suggestion of Teddy Boyce, on Oliver
Twist. My letter reached the “guv’nor” in
Maoriland. He replied that on his return
he would give me an appointment. This he
did. One afternoon I met him in the office
of the Lyceum Theatre. He took me up to
the crush-room at the back of the dress-
circle, Avhere there was a piano. To
my astonishment I was confronted with
such personalities as Bland Holt, “Daddy”
Raynham (Gaiety manager), Courtice
Pounds an d one or two others. I
looked for Mr. Williamson to ask them to
move on so as to leave us alone, and waited
by the piano. But all he said was: “This
is Mr. Taylor—Toso, as Ave call him. Well,
Mr. Toso Taylor, we are ready and waiting.”
I gasped, pulled myself together and went
at it. I read and sang the whole burlesque.
Short rest between the acts, but no word
said. I threw it on the table. “There you
are, Mr. Williamson.” He walked to the
window, turned, and said: “Well, Mr. Rayn-
ham, what do you think of it?” A tense
moment. “Daddy” in his gruff, heavy tra-
gedian voice replied: “Well, Mr. William-
son, I think there is only one woman in
the world who could play that part.” A
tenser moment. Williamson: “Hm! And
Avho is that?” The tensest moment. Then
came the answer, awaited by all: “Nellie
Farren.” Relief! Joy! I knew all was
lovely in the garden. Williamson sent them
all off to the Civil Service, where there was
then a sanded bar at the back, and told me
to folloAV him to the office. He then and
there drew up an agreement. Twenty-five
pounds cash! Ye gods, and I had just got
my return tram fare to Botany rectory!
Twenty-five pounds in two weeks and £50
on the first night. Though overwhelmed, I
still preserved a little business sense. “What
about royalties?” I ventured to ask. “Don’t
worry about that; you’ll be all right if it
comes off, as I think it will.” We then
walked down to the Civil Service, he actu-
ally humming the air of my “Ballad of Oliver
Twist.” Knowing him as I did later, this
was a wonderful compliment. Champagne
all round! I went home to be received with
acclamation, and, after tea, to be taken down
to town and simply made to buy anew outfit.
The end of it was not so happy. William-
sou took it to London, intending to have it
put on at the Gaiety under his crony, George
Edwardes. Unfortunately for me (and, I
think, for the general public!) a revival of
“Little Jack Sheppard” had proved that the
day of burlesque was over —for a time, at
all events. So it was never produced. Of
course, I still have it in the rough, and some
of the ideas and songs may yet prove useful.
Quien sabef
That was the way in those days. A man
was given a chance. Now
Old times are changed; old manners gone;
A stranger fills the Guv’nor’s throne....
The Australian Musical Production Cos.
seems to be a step in the right direction.
But what about theatres?
In 1912, I think, some of us formed the
Australian Dramatic Authors’ Association
(the A.D.A.A.). I was president, Souter
and Adams vice-presidents. We had a very
fair membership and some interesting meet-
ings. But the results were not satisfactory,
the vices resigned, leaving me to carry on.
This I did till I went to England. Then
the war came. And now we are in the ten-
tacles of the American octopus.
T. H. T.
Puppets of Pirandello
Of all modern writers for the theatre
Pirandello is the most original. In content
as well as style he differs essentially from
other dramatists. Till his appearance the
art of drama that dealt primarily with the
passions of man came to be regarded by its
very nature as sentimental and ethical. In the
last resort a play had to deal with some moral
problem; and all the great plays of the past,
from the Greeks to Shakspeare, from Moliere
to Ibsen, represented man as a conscious
and moral being in conflict with destiny.
But Pirandello has a new and entirely dif-
ferent conception of the art of the theatre.
His plays am neither moral nor immoral;
they are purely intellectual. His concern
is not with the storms of passion, the clash
of personalities or the exciting spectacle of
life, but with the question of reality. A
philosopher himself, he presents abstruse
problems of metaphysics in dramatic form.
“What is truth?” asks jesting Pirandello,
and writes a series of fascinating plays for
an answer.
But the plays of Pirandello must not be
confused with the so-called “intellectual”
drama of the last generation. Bernard Shaw
considered himself an exponent of the “drama
of ideas”; but the ideas as promulgated in
his own plays, as in those of writers like
Galsworthy and Granville Barker, were not
“ideas” in a philosophic sense, but rather
opinions on current topics, such as the mar-
riage and divorce laws, the relationship of
capital to labor and similar social, political
and economic problems. But the drama of
Pirandello is made of sterner intellectual
stuff. His ideas are “ideas” almost in
Plato’s sense. As Shakspeare might go to
Plutarch for material, or Shaw to Mommsen
or Herbert Spencer, Pirandello goes boldly
to Spinoza or to Kant’s “Critique of Pure
Reason.” It seems incredible, theoretically,
that great drama could be forced from such
abstract matter; but the modern theatre has
no more vital drama to show.
For works like his “Six Characters in
Search of an Author,” “Henry IV.” and
“Each in His Own Way” are real plays,
not merely theses; and one of the most out-
standing characteristics of Pirandello, who
did not begin to write plays till he was nearly
50, is his uncanny knowledge of stage tech-
nique. His plays, like all good plays, are
written for production on the stage. Put on
first in Italy, in the Teatro d’Arte in Rome,
a theatre created and directed by the drama-
tist, they have now been performed all over
Europe and America. So great has been
their success that recently Charles B.
Cochran, an enterprising manager, took over
the author and his whole company to give a
series of performances in London. A “strange,
disturbing theatre” —that is how it has been
described. One critic feared not that Piran-
dello would lack appreciation, but that he
might have too devastating a success, and
that he would run through British drama-
tists like measles through a school.
The best known of his plays is his “Six
Characters in Search of an Author,” which
the writer himself describes as a “comedy in
the making.” It begins on a half-empty
stage where a manager is about to rehearse
one of Pirandello’s earlier plays. “Is it
my fault,” says the manager, “if France
won’t send us any more good comedies and
we are reduced to putting on Pirandello’s
works, where nobody understands anything
and where the author plays the fool with
us all?” A number of “characters” from an
unwritten play, half-formed psychological
entities which have a life of their own, then
enter and persuade the ifianager to let them
be his new comedy. “You know well,” says
one of the “characters,” that “life is full of
-infinite absurdities, which, strangely enough,
do not even need to appear plausible,
since they are true.” These “characters”
though their supposed author did not
succeed in putting them into a work,
have still their own kind of reality.
A character in a play or book, a
Hamlet or Sancho Panza, may be more real,
after all, than a living man whose personality
is transitory and always changing, because
a “character” has really a life of his own,
marked with his special characteristics, while
a man may very well be nobody. What is
reality? We are all living in a world of
appearances. “You’ll be saying next,” cries
the manager mockingly, “that you, with this
comedy of yours you brought here to act, are
truer and more real than I am!” “Without
doubt!” replies the imaginary characters.
“Our reality doesn’t change, it can’t change.

CROSS is a highly-refined POWER kerosene,
specially proportioned for use in Tractors.
Owing to its exceptional volatility Cross provides
complete combustion. This not only guarantees
all the fuel consumed being converted into
power, hut ensures a minimum of unburnt
kerosene portions escaping into the crankcase
to impair the lubricating properties of the oil.
For sheer pulling power and
freedom from engine trouble
use Cross Power Kerosene.
A New Perfected Tractor Oil
To meet the abnormal lubricating condi-
tions which are peculiar to Farm Tractors,
SHELL TRACTOR OIL -B~
is a heavy-bodied oil which forms a
better piston seal, and successfully resists
the breaking-down effect of kerosene fuel.

DAVID JONES’
It can’t be other than what it is because it
is already fixed for ever.” The unwritten
drama that is partially unfolded, the play
within the play, with its strange characters,
the puppets and the actors, and its fantastic
intermingling of reality and illusion, till
it is difficult to tell where either begins or
ends, produces a work of absorbing dramatic
interest, lit by brilliant flashes of wit and
philosophic imagination.
Lennox Robinson compares the plays of
Pirandello with the famous picture of Vel-
asquez. “The Maids of Honor,” that hangs
in Madrid, in which you see the subject of
the picture and the back of the canvas on
which it is being painted and the mirrored
painter and the King shadowed in a door-
way behind the painter’s back. “In it, as in
Pirandello, reality is pushed back and back
until looking at it you feel that you, too,
make part of Velasquez’s dream; that you,
gazing at it, may only be a part of a vaster
canvas; that you do not exist; that you
have been brushed in by the painter’s hand.”
In a later comedy, “Each in Ilis Own
Way,” Pirandello’s conception is still subtler.
Again we have the play within the play, but
in this case we are asked to consider reality
on four separate planes. The idea was sug-
gested by an experience of his own when a
woman in “real life” recognised herself in
one of his plays. As the “Six Characters”
was a comedy in the making, “Each in His
Own Way” is a comedy on its presentation.
The relationship of art to life, of appearance
to reality, is one of his favorite themes.
Pirandello, the dashing youth of 60, is
Italy’s chief representative of the youngest
drama. With his bold originality of con-
ception, deep psychological insight into the
motives of human action and his masterly
technique, he has already conquered vast
new provinces for the theatre. Though his
themes may be difficult, his method of pre-
sentation is always lucid and straightfor-
ward. He is never showy or merely clever;
he is far too profound a thinker ever to in-
dulge in superficial stage tricks. All sorts
of esoteric meanings have been read into his
works by ingenious literary critics, but they
are quite beside the point. Pirandello him-
self, who ought to know, states quite simply
and sincerely that if such things as a
“philosophy” and a “message” are in his
works, they are there accidentally and in-
cidentally to his real purpose, which, of
course, is aesthetic.
LOUIS ESSON.
What Is Art?
“W.M.W.’s” definition of art (R.P.
24/9/’25) fails to satisfy me. I cannot
accept art as nature seen through tempera-
ment. There are millions of temperaments.
Every man, woman and child on this earth,
bar the silly ones, has temperament; and I
doubt very much whether the mentally defici-
ent are excluded. Max Meldrum comes within
the category of those who have temperament,
and I presume paints through it, or by it, or
with it; yet “W.M.W.” will not admit his
pictures within the realms of art. I don’t
think that temperament is responsible very
much for the many qualities which make
one artist’s work distinct from another’s.
The most pleasing picture may not
have been painted by the artist with
the most beautiful temperament. Nor
is art altogether emotion. I will venture
a definition: Art is the mystic gift of seeing
nature and discovering her soul, her beauti-
ful truths, and, with the aid of pigments,
sounds or whatever medium the skilled
craftsman may select, of crystallising those
truths into a thing of beauty and a joy for
ever. It is essential that the craftsman be
skilled in the use of his medium. The artist
of the Stone Age was just as clear in his
vision of nature as the modern landscapist,
but he had not the skill to give adequate
expression to that vision.
But I am entirely with “W.M.W.” in what
he writes concerning Australian art. It
should strike a distinctive note. This old-
young land of ours was dreaming on when
the Greeks were cutting marble and endow-
ing it almost with life; when Titian,
Raphael and Da Vinci were painting their
masterpieces for the joy and wonder of the
coming generations, and waiting in silence
for the day when her own artists would give
expression to her spirit. There is a mysti-
cism about the Australian bush which has
not yet been expressed on canvas. Though
we have a treasury of paintings by famous
Masters, they are of little, if any, assistance
in this strange Australia. Our ai't must
strike a note different from the art of all
other countries. The feeling of Australian
landscape is at once joyous with sunshine
and dreamy in its hazy distances. Not misty
with a saturated atmosphere, but with the
hazy, dreamy distance of bright sunny days,
such as we experience in Queensland when
the hush is broken only by the long-drawn-
out noise of the cicadas in the gum-trees.
Have you ever been in the bush and felt the
tense hush when the cicadas suddenly stop?
The trouble with most of our artists is
that they are dominated by some influence —
by a school of art, or by some painter of
other climes whose pictures they have studied
in Continental galleries. If an artist woos
nature in a humble spirit, she will open a
book from the pages of which he may learn
the many and beautiful truths she has writ-
ten. He will need no other influence.
Temperament has not as much to do with
art as the perfect-understanding of nature—
the tuning up, as it were, of an artistic soul
to harmonise with her spirit; and when that
exquisite harmony exists the result is inevi-
tably a work of art. Lionel Lindsay thinks
that Arthur Streeton gives us something for
which we can never repay him—the gaiety
of our sunlight transmitted through the
alembic of his mind. I interpret Lindsay as
saying that Streeton is so attuned to nature
that this gaiety is a quality of Australian
landscape which the artist has been able to
discover, and is in no way accountable by
temperament. Gaiety of sunlight is a beauti-
ful quality of our landscape, and if our
artists would only accept its truth and paint
it we would have distinctively Australian
art. Shakspeare and Steele Rudd are widely
apart in the scale of literary genius; yet if
Rudd was influenced by the great dramatist
his inimitable Australian characters would
be made to look absurd. So Steele forgot all
about his Shakspeare when he sketched Dad
and the rest of the Rudd family, and they
are distinctively Australian. George Essex
Evans w T rote:
Not as the songs of other lands
Her song shall be,
Where dim her purple shoreline stands
Above the sea.
As erst she stood, she stands alone,
Her inspiration is her own,
From sunlit plains to mangrove strands;
Not as the songs of other lands
Her song shall be.
And her art shall also be different from that
of other lands.
E. COLCLOUGH.
Revolution and Evolution
“Who,” said Carlyle, “can bring a wise
thing out of men unwise? Not one. And so
vacancy and general abolition having come
for this France, what can Anarchy do more? ’
Much the same vein of thought runs through
some chapters in an interesting volume,
Progress and the Past, by George Frederick
Wates (Allen and Unwin), dealing with
some of the essentials to the progress of
mankind. He contrasts the comparative
failure of the. French Revolution, taking a
terrible toll of life and ending in a condition
from which the genius of Napoleon and the
bayonets of his grenadiers alone rescued it,
with the peaceful evolution of new Japan.
The revolution did something: it removed
feudal burdens, swept away restrictions and
privileges; it destroyed but did not create.
After six years it closed in anarchy. ‘ O
man of toil, thy struggling and thy daring
these six long years of insurrection and
tribulation, thou hast profited nothing by it
then? Thou consumest thy herring and
water in the blessed gold-red evening.” The
people had danced and whirled and sung
through those feverish years, “denouncing
all aristocrats as traitors, all monarclis as
tyrants and mistaking that lust of blood
which grew with what it fed on for love of
liberty.” And at the end they were no longer
a coherent people, but a rabble without
vision, a nation without political design,
awaiting a constructive system and, above
all, awaiting a masterful personality. They
found the master in Napoleon and liberty
was held only at the point of his sword.
On the other hand, consider the case of
Japan. In 1867 the Emperor, by the resig-
nation of the Shogun, a body which had for
over a thousand years usurped the functions
of the governing power, assumed complete
authority. The Shogun, not having adequate
means of resistance, had yielded to
the pressure of outside nations seeking to
establish trade relations with Japan. Im-
bued with an intense patriotism which re-
garded the soil of their nation as sacred, the
great feudal lords, the daimios, looked to
the now paramount Emperor for a united
effort to maintain its dignity and integrity.
But to their amazement, “instead of the
people being called upon, as they eagerly
expected, to unite under their Emperor and
expel the foreigners, a rescript was published
in which it was stated that ‘intercourse
with foreign countries shall in future be
carried on in accordance with the public law
of the whole world.’ ” Thus Japan came
into the comity of civilised nations, and the
path to progress lay open before her. That
path was beset by difficulties that among a
less sagacious people would, probably, have
brought about internal strife and ultimate
chaos. As the country then stood, there
were 260 daimios with almost full power in
their extensive domains, living as feudal
princes in fortified castles, and each main-
taining his army of samurai. The samurai
were not only hereditary soldiers ; they were
also scholars and administrators, and both
supported the authority of the daimios and
managed their estates. Kido, of Chosu, one
of the most intelligent and accomplished of
them, saw that the position had become
impossible. He sought out his daimio and
set before him all the difficulties of the
situation. The perpetuation of feudal con-
ditions would put chains upon any effort
Japan could make to come abreast of her
now freely admitted competitors. The Em-
peror had taken up for his people the burden
of a modern nation, and Japan must come
into line. Kido asked his daimio to set
an example of patriotism by returning his
domain to the Emperor. The Prince gave
him power to act as he thought fit, and the
estate was handed to the Emperor as the
representative of the people. The other
daimios followed suit, and the effect of the
surrender was, a few years later, the uni-
fication of Japan. There could be no more
illuminating illustration of genuine patriot-
ism and sheer eommonsense'. Compare it
with the attitude of the feudal lords and
aristocrats of France who precipitated that
condition of anarchy into which the revolu-
tion plunged the nation.
From then on Japan progressed. Reeep
tive, keen to learn and still keener to adapt,
she has never looked back. Every depart-
ment of State has been reorganised, and to
this day the Japanese intense love of in-
quiry and analysis, her keenness in absorbing
all that is new and best in the western world,
is ardently in evidence. In not a few
respects she is in advance of her past
teachers.
The author draws his conclusions from
these two instances of attempted progress
on the respective lines of revolution and
evolution. The French Revolution failed to
reach its objective because it was a scheme
nebulous and indefinite, essentially icono-
clastic and without having at its base a
reasonable design for reconstruction. It
was lacking in level-headedness, reasonable-
ness and eommonsense. It made fine phrases
and catcli-words serve the place of sober
reasoning. “Freedom,” it has been said,
“is for those who are fit for it,” and the
revolutionaries —excepting perhaps Mirabeau
and the Girondists- —were not fit. Had they
been so the evolutionary way would have
been easy. Being unfit they took the path
of violence —that final resort of the intellectu-
ally impotent. Japan had behind her the
patriotism which looks ahead to the future
welfare of the nation; she had leaders who
had a sane outlook on the practical possi-
bilities of life; above all, she had a people
prepared to sink the question of personal
advantage in the larger issue of the welfare
of the State.
T. B. c.
The Psalms of David
The Hebrews were a practical race. There
is something homely and attractive in the
list which gives a stud-bull that “failetli
not” among the good tilings of life that fall
to the lot of the lucky Wicked Man who
doesn’t deserve them. And could one have
a more satisfying and mouth-filling curse
than “May they go down to Hell quick”?
(No, I know it doesn’t mean what you mean.
But allow that “quick” really means “alive,”
and the pious hope loses nothing of its
thoroughness.)
Here are some passages that might apply
to various members of the community to-
day. Translations may differ slightly ; these
are taken from the Prayer Book version:—
Flappers’ Dance : Strange children,
whose mouth talketh of vanity. (144.11.)

The Steady Soaker : He putteth down

(55.21.)
The Pacifist : I labor for peace, but
when I speak unto them thereof they make
them ready to battle. (120.6.)
The Bolshies : They murder the widow
and the stranger, and put the fatherless to
death. (94.6.)
The Politician : I went with the multi-
tude. (42.4.) I kept silence, but it was pain
and grief to me. (39.3.)
The Politician on the Press : They
daily mistake my words; all that they
imagine is to do me evil. (56.5.)
The Woman Politician : Let not man
have the upper hand. (9.19.)
Government Loans ; Oh, how great is
the sum of them! (139.17.) The ungodly
borroweth and payetli not again. (37.21.)
Canberra : They went astray in the wild-
erness out of the way, and found no city
to dwell in. (107.11.)
The Queenslander and the Prickly-
pear : They that are cursed of him shall be
rooted out. (37.22.)
The Afghan ; Lice in all their quarters.
(105.31.)
South Australia (after 1904) : Since
the time that their corn and wine and oil
increased. (4.8.)
Westralia : Look how wide the east is
from the west. (103.12.)
The Freehold Blocker : Destroy them
that speak leasing. (5.6.)
Sheep Farming (since the rise in wool) :
Better than a bullock that hath horns and

The Stock Exchange : I said unto the
fools, Deal not so madly. (75.5.)
The K.C.: How dear are thy counsels.
(139.17.)

Tennis : Spread a net abroad with cords.
(140.5.)

service. (72.11.)

Football : When my foot slipped, they
rejoiced greatly over me. (38.16.)

cursing and bitterness. (14.6.)

A Satchel of Books
The Baker’s Cart, by Gerald Bullett (John Lane).
A volume of short stories bv the author of “Mr.
Godly Beside Himself.” Written with the construc-
tive skill and literary economy of the accomplished
writer of this form of fiction. Their dramatic strength
does not exclude from them a strong human element
of emotional sympathy.
From Groves of Palm, by Bella Sidney Woolf
(Heffer). The writer of these sketches and essays)
Mrs. W. T. Southorn has a pleasant flowing style
and a sense of humor that enable her to make
good reading out of a variety of topics, from a
rainy day in Colombo to the Hall of a Thousand
Columns. She has done similar work before.
Motor Cycling, by John H. Wyatt (Harrap). The
author was formerly editor of a motor journal, and
his book is issued as one of the “Master of
Sports” series. If it inculcates something of the
sporting spirit in owners of these machines it will
serve a good purpose. Too often they merely con-
trive to make a public nuisance of themselves.
The Two Duties of a Christian, by Percy Dearmor
(Heifers). The fourth volume of a series, “Lessons
On the Way,” the object being to present the Chris-
tian religion to young people in a form not only
lucid but attractive. The book should be found
useful by teachers not only for expository purposes,
but to meet difficulties raised by modern criticism.
Peace and Goodwill in Industry, by Stanley
Baldwin (Allen and Unwin). Three speeches by
the Prime Minister of Britain, one delivered in the
House of Commons, the others in Birmingham and
Leeds. The burden of these utterances is that reform
must come from the people themselves. “The organ-
isations of employers and men, if they take their
coats off to it, are,” he says, “far more able to
work out the solutions of their troubles than the
politicians.”
♦
“Ces” : Black Brudder is to be presented with the
gospel acording to St. Luke in the Arunta language,
said to be the first time Luke has ever appeared in
abo. Most of it looks like a badly-pied printer’s
line, set by a compositor who has been chief guest
at a wayzgoose. The man responsible for this new
endeavor to spread the Gospel in printed form is
the Rev. A. T. Thompson, Australian General Sec.
of the British and Foreign Bible Society; and
Katanning (W.A.) subscribed most of the cost of
translation and printing. It is soon to be distri-
buted among the abos., probably by means of a
touring motor-van specially fitted as a library. The
appearance of Luke in Arunta makes the total of
languages into which it has been translated 573.

SINGLE -SIX SEVEN PASSENGER TOURING CAR
IN appearance, in performance, in the positive knowledge that there can be nothing
better, the Packard Single-Six stands absolutely alone. Here is a motor car that will
wear well for ten years ; that combines luxurious motoring with economy of up-keep ;
that is not excessive in price in short, the Packard Single-Six is the car for the man
who desires to own a distinctive car at a moderate price.
Important new features have been added to the latest Packard models which appear in
no other car in the world. The Chassis Pressure Lubricator and the Motor Oil Rectifier,
for instance, form a combination which makes the motors almost human in caring for
themselves. What were formerly garage jobs can now be done while the car is running
at top speed.
The Chassis Pressure Lubricator—or as it is sometimes called, the"one-shot oiling system”
-—on the latest Packards is exceedingly simple in operation. It oils each of the 45 chas-
sis points requiring lubrication, by means of a pressure pump plunger. The oil is fed
through concealed pipes and drilled parts a completely built-in feature of the Packard
chassis. It is only necessary to pull out and release the plunger and the job is done.
The Motor Oil Rectifier prevents dilution and retains the viscous condition of the
motor oil. It promotes long motor life and smooth and silent operation through auto-
matically maintaining all the desirable properties in fresh oil. Because of this device it
is necessary to change the motor oil only four or five times in the year.
Balloon tyres, an exceptional spring length and wheel-base, a delightful steering-ease, and
a thorough attention to comfort make Packard motoring incomparable.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mid October.
The afternoon is full of quiet light,
Golden and warm along the trodden way
And golden-brown where sleepy shadows
stray
Between the straight stems marching to the
height,
Their even ranks breast-forward to the white
Of one walled home. Below, red cattle
stray
Through crackling branches; and the
stream, at play,
Dances down shadowy crags in broken flight.
Voices of children fill the day with sound,
A languid call comes from the vine-draped
door,
A window rises letting in the air
To softly sway a curtain; and, half drowned
In scent of roses, a low song sweeps o'er
The long light falling down the dusty stair.

Had It Been You
“Had it been you!” my mother said,
And put my comfort by.
I was wept out, too overspent
To ask her why.
I knew that I was always weak
And she was always strong;
And if my mother meant it so
She did no wrong.
It’s sad to see a tree in flower
Blown over in the dust;
And mothers love a splendid thing.
It is but just.
It did not even hurt me much,
I was so strange and sore —
Ah, when the sky has rained a flood,
What’s one drip more?
It is a way they have in grief:
They know not what they do.
They turn upon the nearest one —
"Had it been you”

The Path.
O starry path so still and sweet
That winds amid the jasmine gloom
And glimmers pale beneath my feet
Through bushes drooped with honeyed
bloom,
To dewy fields of faerie
Your winding ways are leading me.
The leaves above me stir and croon ;
The air is filled with murmured sound.
The mellow magic of the moon
Has silvered o’er the charmed ground.
Among the dusky pines I see
The luring light of faerie.
Will o’ the wisp, a witching flame,
Is dancing tlier<? on jewelled feet.
Leaf-latticed was the way I came .
To this secluded hushed retreat;
The elfin folk before the morn
Will seven times ring the budding thorn.
The night is blossom-sweet. The pale
Moon-moths flit by on silken wings.
Moon-magic draws a mystic veil
Between this place and common things:
The silver stars are shining through
The tented cover of the blue.
What gift has this enchanted hour
Beyond the glamor of the night?
Joy lives in every azure flower
And peace within the lily white;
And beauty, sweetness, melody
Are golden gifts of faerie!
VICTORIA.
ETHEL MARTYR.
On the Pier.
Upon the pier we sat and fished,
The lines trailed from our hands;
The waters lapped upon the rocks
And rippled on the sands..
Behind us slept the seaside town,
Its many voices still;
And white, as some white planet, shone
The beacon on the hill.
A large star sent a silver track
Across the making tide ;
The long weeds in the shallows rose
And swayed from side to side.
Great calm upon the water's face,
Great silence seemed to dwell;
Across the cove one gum-tree showed,
A silent sentinel.
No bird made musical the air,
No feathered minstrel stirred :
No sound, except the lapping tide,
Upon the rocks was heard.
Beneath the pier the shadows lurked
Deep wells of dusk, save when
Some fish, disturbed from sleep, awoke,
Flashed fire and slept again.
At times the murmur of the sea,
I ike some vast droning hive
Of bees, came pulsing in to tell
The world was still alive.
And now and then through stillness came
An eerie sound and drear —
The siren of some ship that woke
Strange echoes far and near.
No word we said, no song we sang,
But watched the long night through,
Till moist upon our hair came down
The chill, thick morning dew.
And then the rocks took shape at last,
The glooms and shadows cleared;
And roseate on ,tliqt muted scene
The trembling dawn appeared.

THE GREAT WOOLLEN-MILL
SCANDAL.
A vast amount of bunkum is being hurled
at the public with regard to the sale of a
Commonwealth Government woollen-cloth
factory at Geelong. Accounts of the tragedy
vary according to the taste and fancy of
the narrator, but the usual story is that
a nefarious Administration “sold the great
woollen mills, which returned a profit of
£400,000, for a song—simply gave them away
to its friends in Flinders-lane.” Those who
listen to these more or less gifted romancers
are apt to carry away the impression that
the Governmeqt has gone out of woollen
manufacture altogether. This is not the
case. There is a Government clothing fac-
tory which turns out uniforms and similar
articles for Commonwealth employees—sol-
diers, bluejackets, postmen and railwaymen,
for instance—and executes orders for State
departments. This concern has not been
sold, nor is it likely to be. During the war
it employed over 700 hands —714 was the
number on June 30, 1915, and 701 on June
30, 1916. There was also a woollen-cloth
factory which never had more than 359
hands, the average being 265. This latter is
the factory which, expanded into “great wool-
len mills” by soaring imaginations, is the
cause of all the fuss.
* * * #
Unlike the clothing factory, which arrived
in 1911, the woollen-cloth factory was
established during the war. It manufactured
serge, tweed, flannel, blankets and rugs, and
during the years in which its entire output
was required for war and repatriation as
well as departmental purposes all went well.
But “when the financial year 1921-22
closed”—the words are those of the Muni-
tions Supply Board —“it was found that there
was not sufficient Government work offering
to keep the factory occupied for more than
a few months of the year.” Part-time opera-
tions being out of the question, the Hughes
Government (Hughes was then in power)
had to decide between selling the factory for
what it would fetch and entering into com-
petition with the privately-owned mills then
in existence and the considerable number
planned—some of the latter in struggling
country towns like Albany (W.A.), which
were trying to get out of the ruck. It re-
solved to sell, and no unbiassed Australian
conversant with the history of Government
trading and the political conditions brought
about by the multiplication of unnecessary
Government employees will say it was wrong.
The allegation is also made that the sale
was hurried on in the interests of the pur-
chasers. This is what the Munitions Board
says:—
Public tenders were first invited in July, 1922.
Tenderers were asked to tender for the purchase of
the land, buildings and plant, and were required to
take over the stock at a valuation to be agreed upon
by two arbitrators; one to be appointed by the
Department and one by the successful tenderer. The
highest tender received was £130,000, which the
Government did not feel justified in accepting, and
fresh tenders were invited, with the result that two
offers were received, namely, £135,000 and
£150,000. Particulars concerning the tenders were
made available in other States, in Maoriland and
Britain, and, in view of the time that had been
allowed and the publicity that had been given, there
did not appear any likelihood of any better offer
coming to light. Negotiations were entered into
with the highest tenderer, and the offer of £150,000
was increased to £155,000, the Government to allow
ten years for the balance of the payment of the
purchase money and the rate of interest on the
unpaid balance money to be 54 p.c. The sale of the
mill on the terms mentioned was approved by the
Government, and all the terms of the contract of
sale having been complied with, possession was
taken by thp Federal Woollen Mills Pty., Ltd., on
June 5, 192*3.
In other words, the negotiations were com-
menced by one Government and completed
11 months later by another (the Bruce-
Page Government dates from Feb. 9, 1923),
after two lots of tenders had been considered.
No evidence of indecent haste there!
* * * *
Nor is there anything to warrant the accu-
sation that the mill was “simply given away.”
The Munitions Board states that buildings,
machinery, plant, stock and product in course
of manufacture were sold at a profit of
£47,028 16s. Bd. The Auditor-General, after
certifying that this amount was correct, de-
ducted an item of £132 11s. Bd., which “sub-
sequent expenditure,” he says, “reduced the
net profit to £46,896 ss. If the Com-
monwealth Government could sell its insol-
vent steamers, or the Queensland Govern-
ment its canneries and cattle-runs, or the
S. Aus. Government its “thousand homes,”
or theN.S.W. Government the ddbris of its flat-
head-catching enterprise and show a profit
of £46,000, this coup try would be a lot better
off, and not in a financial sense only. The
trading profit, which reached £400,000 in the
Labor politician’s imagination, shrinks in
the Munitions Board’s estimate to £219,014
10s. 7d., or £27,377 p.a. Considering that
the factory operated mostly in boom years
and was exempt from Customs duties, income-
tax, War-profits tax, land-tax and local
rates, besides getting money at 5 p.c. and
dividends on a privileged investment in Brit-
ish Dyes, Ltd., the profit is nothing to write
home about; in any case, profits arising from
transactions in which the Government is
manufacturer and purchaser, and in which
no allowance is made for rates and taxes,
are more or less conjectural. Australian ex-
perience suggests that had the factory re-
mained under Government ownership, to
compete against private mills (some of which
are having a very rough passage) in normal
times, there would have been no profits even
of the conjectural sort —only the familiar
losses. It now employs 20 or 25 p.c. more
labor than when the Government ran it and
pays taxes on its profits, although there is
no evidence that the purchasers are making
a fortune —certainly the shares are in no
great demand. Neither is it owned nor con-
trolled by Flinders-lane.
* * * #
There is a disnosition on the part of some
Ministerialists to apologise for the sale of
this cloth factory. Apologies are not needed.
The transaction was warranted and should
he defended. If the defence is supplemented
by a few vigorous remarks about the need
for crying a halt to the politically-dangerous
extension of Government employment (with
special reference to the abject surrender of
the Queensland Labor Ministry to the em-
ployees on its dilapidated railways, which
have cost the taxpayer nearly 12 millions in
11 years), so much the better. Government
competition and the fear of Government com-
petition are retarding the growth of manu-
facturing industries in Australia. Yet a lot
more Government competition is threatened by
the Federal and State Labor parties, the
former in particular. The Federal Labor-leader
even talks of starting Commonwealth agri-
cultural-implement factories “to reduce the
cost of implements to the primary producer.”
A Westralian Labor Government estab-
lished an agricultural-implement factory in
1912. It is not even pretended nowadays
that this factory “reduced the cost of
implements to the primary producer,” but it
wiped out small privately-owned factories
and prevented others from starting; also, it
has been a persistent and substantial con-
tributor to the Westralian deficit. And it
has dismally failed to hold its own with pri-
vate manufacturers in the Eastern States,
handicapped though the latter are by freight
charges which go as high as £lO per machine.
The Tariff Board has recently shown that
the manufacturers in question have devel-
oped Australian-invented implements to the
great advantage of the Australian farmer;
that their industry is distinguished by effici-
ency and the spirit of public service; that
prices and trading profits are alike reason-
able (“Australian-made implements are sold
cheaper than imported implements”) ; and
that “there is no need to import dutiable
agricultural implements,” since “the Austra-
lian makers can meet all reasonable demands.”
This report was quoted approvingly by
Matthew Charlton in his policy speech.
Yet in the next breath he spoke of starting
a Commonwealth Government factory to cut
into the trade of these good Australians and
solid taxpayers. A crazier project was never
conceived.

THE GRANDEST EDUCATION SYSTEM
ON EARTH.
"It is no idle boast on my part to say that the
present system of education in N. S. Wales, embrac-
ing all stages from the kindergarten to the Univer-
sity, is the finest in the world. At one time the
Department of Education was the Cinderella of the
Government departments, and only a small sum was
voted for its administration. Now, however, it is
the greatest spending department of all, and it is
going to spend more next year. We have big schemes
ahead, but we have considerable leeway to make up
before we see the consummation of our desires.”- —
Premier Lang, of N. S. Wales, at an opening func-
tion.
Smug, windbaggy self-idolatry is an irri-
tating feature of many politicians who run
Australia. No party has a monopoly of the
habit. When the State elections were in
progress a political opponent solemnly
warned Lang that his stupid fictions would
not pass muster because the N. S. Wales
community was the most intelligent in the
world. Lang, while accepting that state-
ment as a personal compliment, went one
better with the assurance that it is the best
educated community in the world; neverthe-
less, he, being able to give points to the
other educators of the world, was going to
greatly improve on that education. The
man who strikes that sort of attitude has
wonderful confidence in himself, or in the
ignorance of his hearers, or both.
* * *
Australia has a fairly good system of
knowledge-supply, but nothing to grow
hysterical about. As compared with other
white communities of any size which use the
British language it is lamentably short, in
facilities for the top storey of instruction ;
and N. S- Wales, the topic of Lang’s eulogy,
is the shortest. It owns one university,
with a mere 2688 individual students, to
serve 2,265,000 people and 309,000 square
miles of country; and at the other end of
the local scale Tasmania, with 26,215 square
miles and 215,000 inhabitants, also possesses
one university. Maoriland and the Unicm of
South Africa, with far less than N.S.W.’s
white population, run four and nine universi-
ties respectively, and do it as a matter of
course, and without bumptiousness. Interme-
diate education of the high-school kind is on a
limited scale in the Ma State. The ordinary
or primary variety, compulsory between the
ages of 7 and 14, is represented by
a fair supply of schools, with an enrol-
ment of scholars'which would be considered
small in some countries and. very small in
a few, a middling attendance, and such a
dearth of teachers that Premier Lang’s col-
league Minister Mutcii talks of importing
them in quantities. One trouble is that the
bloated city grows so fast that it is difficult
to keep up the supply of new academies,
while the small towns moulder so that the
old academy is often too big.
Recent education statistics are available
for 32 out of the 48 United States. They
furnish interesting comparisons. In New
York and Ohio (first and third for popula-
tion) compulsory education doesn’t cease
till the age of 18. In Pennsylvania (second
for population) it extends to 16, and it is
the same in 13 other States. Three fix 15
as the lowest retiring age. Three States
offer free education for the whole period
from the age of 6 to 21, one from
5 to 21, and one from 5 to 20, with,
of course, a compulsory period sand-
wiched in between the starting and
finishing times. Not only docs the enrol-
ment at primary schools appear high in
proportion to population as N. S. Wales
ideas go, but that at high schools, as well as
at colleges, appears enormous. About one
in 19 or 20 of Premier Lang’s young sub-
jects refuses to stop at the stage of arrested
mental development represented by the date
where compulsion leaves off, while the other
18 or 19 let the matter drop at that. Yet
it is common enough in the United States
for one in five to pursue knowledge another
long stage after leaving the primary insti-
tution, and in some places nearly half the
students do so. For a land which has to
struggle with niggers, Mexicans and parti-
ally digested hordes from Eastern Europe,
the position is commendable.
•* * * *
Education, such as it is, must be respon-
sible to a considerable extent for making the
Australian community what it is. One out-
standing characteristic is a lack of feelf-
dependence and a readiness to borrow, beg,
spend and let-it-slide which places this people
in a category by itself. It lias also developed
a credulity which is vast and awe-inspiring,
and it has grown an ear the size of a tent,
which is at the service of any crank provided
he is imported and is sufficiently unconvinc-
ing and overbearing. As a result Australia
is the one English-speaking land which has
opened its door wide to the infected spectre
of Communism, and invited the creature to
come in and take a seat and make itself at
home. A considerable section of the race
heaps scorn upon the laws of its own making
in order to demonstrate its independence,
while obeying humbly and like a whipped
slave the orders of greasy foreign masters,
who are masters by its own making, in order
to demonstrate its fidelity. The standard of
knowledge in Parliament is very low. Men
with university or high-school training or
high training of any sort are rare, and are
rather viewed with dislike and suspicion.
There have been Laborites of no small poli-
tical rank who urged the abolition of history
as a school subject lest the coming genera-
tion should learn too much from the past, and
others who urged the abolition of universities
as tending to “capitalism.” The Premier of
N. S. Wales himself, though the most bril-
liant product that the dominant party of the
most populous State could dig out, hardly
does all the credit he might to the ffnest edu-
cation system in the world. Something seems
to be wanti’ z.
THE CONFUSION OF TRACKS.
The Australian fighting man proved himself
in the hardest-fought war the world has ever
known the equal of any and the superior of
most. The Australian worker, when he
works, has shown himself on the statistics
of his output to be the best in the world.
The Australian athlete holds his own and
more in nearly every branch of sport. The
patent records show that, on a population
basis, there are more inventions and
attempted inventions in Australasia than
anywhere else. In literature and art there
is, again on a population basis, probably a
bigger body of effort among Australians than
among the people of any other nation. Yet,
despite these indications of ability and
energy, there are few countries where
poorer use is made of national opportunity.
In Sydney people suffer almost annually from
water-shortage, though the hills are torn into
deep furrows by the storm-water that runs
to waste. With a marked increase in the
population of the continent during the last
two decades there is actual loss of population
in most districts. Immense areas, larger
than the territories of great European
Powers, are lying almost waste, though there
is clear evidence that their exploitation would
multiply the national wealth. A network of
railways, very extensive in proportion to
population, forms a orescent about the south-
ern, eastern and western parts of the con-
tinent: yet for lack of access to deep-sea
ports which actually exist a large part of
the haulage on those railways is sheer waste.
The potential wealth of the country is enor-
mous, the actual production is large, the
people earn a great deal of money; yet the
standard of comfort is not particularly high.
Food is very plentiful, but never very cheap;
knowledge and general information are wide-
spread, but the indications of public taste
and culture are not marked; the country
has an immense body of politicians, yet
little in the way of definite policies. Putting
all things together—-the energy, the ability,
the intention, the resources, the misfit
arrangements and the hesitant progress—it
is clear that there is something lacking in
our way of doing things that makes for enor-
mous waste of good material, physical, men-
tal and moral.
* * * *
Of course, it is argued that Australia is
a new country. A century and a half of ex-
perience should not, howmver, leave us in our
raw youth ; and, anyhow, the very newness
is in favor of better organisation. It is
easier to build a new factory on up-to-date
lines than to re-model an old factory, easier
to plan a farm on virgin soil to suit the
methods of modern farming than to straighten
out an old farm that was arranged for an
altogether different type of agriculture. So
the newness of Australia is no excuse for so
much ’bus-missing. The truer explanation—
though it cannot be urged as an excuse—is
that Australia was from the first so prodigal
of opportunity that opportunity became the
cheapest of national possessions; and the
general attitude of mind springing from that
sense of cheapness has made us poor national
organisers. We go half-way towards doing
a great many things and leave the other
half undone. Our main roads, which we are
now tackling in a way that shows we are
almost three-quarters in earnest, were long
typical of most other things. In parts they
were good; in other parts incredibly bad.
Even the new motor roads occasionally fall
back to the bullock-track standard. But
the ruder roads of remoter places still better
exemplify the national habit. Where tin-
ground is liable to be cut up by wheels in
wet weather, there are frequently ten or a
dozen parallel tracks, so prodigal was tin-
open space of opportunity. Yet the people
who were content with any sort of divergent
make-shift track were excellent drivers:
there could be no question of that. In almost
every department of Australian life make-
shift methods and excellent driving are the
rule.
* * * »
There is small indication from the election
speeches of Federal party leaders that we
are approaching any great change in pol-
itical modes or ideas. It is true that Charl-
ton has made a statement with regard to
Australian manufactures which should mean
that the Labor party has in its mind effec-
tive Protection. The trouble is that such
a declaration was not made until consider-
able dissatisfaction was shown with the
tariff of the Nationalist party; and that
with the fact that the most virulent Free-
trader of them all .is No. 1 on the party s
list for the Senate gives the whole thing
more the appearance of an opportunist trick
than of a gravely settled policy. In the
main, the Nationalist policy is, indeed, what-
ever Labor will not do; the Labor policy
whatever the Nationalist party will not do.
The Yes-No of years gone by has given
place to the No-No of the present hour.
Yet there never was a time when Australia
so greatly needed a strong lead into new
places. The problems are very much the
same as those of 20 years ago; and the
political side-tracks round those problems
have grown very numerous. As we need
main roads of substantial formation for
the increasing weight of the motor traffic, so
we need broader and stronger highways to
carry the weight of nationhood. All the
material is there to our hands, and every-
where exeept among the politicians there
appear to be glimpses of the grander vision.
The fault may lie with our political sys-
tems or with our constitution; the one
thing that seems quite clear is that Aus-
tralian thought is stronger in the streets and
homes than it is on the political platform.
The country is waiting for a lead into the
future. The war sores are largely healed
and much of the confusion of the ragged
years has passed. It is the time of larger
opportunity, and such times are the eternal


test of nationhood. If the machine by which
we run the country is incapable of producing
men of the size and vision we require, it
is the business of Australia to demand that
the machine shall be altered. The trouble
is that the present system suits the people
who are driving as well as those who want
to push them off the seat and be themselves
the drivers. Under such circumstances mad-
brained revolutionaries get a certain hear-
ing, because revolutionaries of different type,
of sober, thought, are not in the picture.

THE CHICKENS OF COSME.
When away back in the ’nineties I first struck
Cosme Colony— William Lane’s second
attempt to establish a heaven on earth in Para-
gUay„l found my brother Communists in
the throes of a chicken controversy. It
appeared that in the previous season a lot
of maize had become weevily and unfit for
human food, so they had decided to start a
Communal poultry-farm and feed the grain
to the chicks. For a start they fenced a
yard and built a racoon-proof fowlliouse.
Then they gathered up—under protest—all
the chickens in the colony. The married
people, Who, despite their principles, thought
they Were the owners of the fowls, didn t.
like it; but the single men, who were feeding
at the galley, said: “What ho! This is where
we get new-laid eggs for breakfast every
morning.” The Works Manager look old
Jimmie from the hoeing gang and made him
Chief Poultryman, with a boy as offsider to
gather green stuff and take the eggs to the
Secretary to be counted and handed over
to the Storekeeper for distribution, pro rata,
one man one egg. Now, this was dinkuni
for the single men. But the married women
jibbed. One egg wouldn’t go far in a family
of five; and, anyway, they had reared those
chicks—hatched them under the bed, some-
times, to keep them from racoons —and
reckoned they were entitled to preferential
treatment. They didn’t get it. The Presi-
dent, John Lane—William was away beat-
ing up recruits, but he never came back —
said they must be good and it was all for the
Cause. Moreover, he had to keep the single
men sweet, or they might pick up Matilda
and hump her to the railway works. The
married ones didn’t matter, as their impedi-
menta fixed them.
Then there came a day when there was no
more maize—none for dampers, let alone for
fowls. True, there was plenty of beans; but
we couldn’t afford to feed chickens with
them. We’d been living on beans for the
last two months and would have to do it
for two months more if they didn’t give out.
When the Head Poultryman found there
Was hO more hen-feed lie went to theWurks
Manager and asked, him What about it. The
Works Manager went to the Secretary and
asked him what he knew about that. The
Secretary left off writing “euffers” for the
Cosme Monthly and went to interview the
Storekeeper. Quoth the Secretary: “W hy
iidn’t you, give notice of the coming shortage of
fowl-food ?” The Storekeeper told the Secretary
to go to —well, not Heaven. Actually, he
went to the President, who asked him if he
thought it was up to him, with all his mani-
fold duties and worries, to find the chickens
in tucker. So we had a meeting of all the
big heads and all the little heads that liked
to roll up when a blast on the cow-horn was
blown three times. The upshot of the meet-
ing was a decision that as there was no
maize and they wouldn’t give ’em beans, the
chickens must fend for themselves. The
President, the Secretary and the Works
Manager drafted an order to the Head Poul-
tryman to the effect that he was to keep the
fowls shut up each morning till 9 o’clock
and they had finished laying—all Communal
chickens will lay before 9 a.m. Then he
Was to turn them out to fend for themselves.
A proviso was added that got old Jimmie’s
hair off. He, the Head Poultryman, was
to keep tight on to their tails and see they
didn’t get into the mandioca patches or worry
the young maize, and he was to bring them
home to roost at 5 p.m. (Signed and de-
livered this day of so and so.)
“Look here, young fellow me lad, said
Jimmie at 9 a.m. next day, “if you don t
look after these fowls and keep ’em all to-
gether I’m going to ask the Works Manager
to put you in the hoeing gang and give me
a better mate. See?” Young Ted said he
did, and he would, but he found he couldn t.
Fowls are not sheep ; they w r on’tgo in flocks. At
least these didn’t; they scattered all over the
place in search of tucker. Jimmie went to
have a smoke and a sleep, whilst young Ted,
after a vain attempt to drive them where he
wanted them (i.e., under the orange-trees),
told them to go where they dam’ well liked.
Of course they got into the cultivated patches
and there was the devil to pay when the
Works Manager found Jimmie and Ted try-
ing to get them out, after the knock-off liortt
had gone at 5 p.m. .
The Works Manager, being a practical
man, at once saw that it was a job for all
hands. He went along to headquarters, and,
as it was an urgent case, he, without consult-
ing the President and the Secretary, blew
four blasts on the cow-horn. That meant
gather round the President, pronto. I hey
did, at the double. • Up came the hoeing
gang, the sawpit gang, the building gang and
the odd-job gang; also the women and kids.
They thought another revolution had struck
them, but it was only the Communal chick-
ens in the mandioca patch. It took all
hands a full hour —and there’s no time and
a half for Communistic overtime, not even
an extra feed of beans —to get those chickens
rounded up into the yard. Then it was
found they w 7 ere six short. That night an
aroma of stewed chicken was wafted over
the colony and several of the hoeing gang
looked unusually well fed next morning.
At the Cabinet meeting after the round-
up it was decided that, as they couldn’t sack
Jimmie and his aide, they would promote
them to jobs of less responsibility, the chick-
ens (what there were left of them — Jimmie
reckoned the foxes got away with them at the
rate of three a week) to be returned to their
original owners. Proposed, seconded and
carried. Next business. Proposed by the 1 re-
sident, seconded by the Secretary, that, as the
single men had got used to eggs, the eggs be
gathered up at each week-end and distributed
as before. Carried. Next day young TED
was made sharpener to the hoemen; but
Jimmie said his hands had got too soft for
hoeing and he’d like to be offsider to the
cook in the single-men’s mess. Instead, lie
got the job of cleaning out the sawpit. Now
came the job of redistributing the fowls. Ihe
Sec. took it in hand, and was surprised to
find that the women didn’t want them under
the new conditions. It was only. after heart-
to-heart talks with their respective husbands
and hints about being thrown out in the
wilderness that they obeyed the ultimatum.
Every week-end thereafter the Sec. and his
assistant, with a little book and a big bar-
row, called round to gather the eggs. But
somehow the fowls had mysteriously ceased
to lay, and the barrow always returned very
nearly empty. As time went on the eggs
grew fewer and fewer till the Sec. thought
he could save labor by scrapping the barrow
and making his collection with a basket.
Then they got so few he scrapped the basket
and took them home in his hat. At this point
the single men sent in an ultimatum: bo
eggs, no work.” The women merely replied
that the hens were on strike, and that the
Cabinet had better deal with them.
Tile maize-slielling season had come round
again, and there was now whips of rough
stuff suitable for chickens; so, by order, the
Sec. and his men raided the back yards and
started the Communal yard once more. The
women gave them up—couldn’t help them-
selves. All except Mrs. L ; . When the
Secretary called round with his little book
Mrs. L met him in the front garden.
“Now, ma’am, how many do I get from
you?” “Fourteen, including the rooster,
said Mrs. L -, and went on pulling up
weeds. “You’ll find them round the back.
They found them —with their heads chopped
off. ' It was all the poor fed-up woman could
do to register her protest.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The King’s Peace.
“The Federal Government’s course is marked defi-
nitely before it. If the law is defied we propose to
exercise a power which has never been exercised in
the Commonwealth yet. There is a King’s Peace of the
Commonwealth running concurrently with the King s
Peace inside the States. Up to this hour in our
history it has been sufficient to rely upon that King’s
Peace in the States. If the State Governments re-
fuse protection, and take certain action against the
whole of Australia, we will bring down a Common-
wealth Crimes Act. We shall define these crimes and
shall take the necessary steps to enforce our own
laws, if the States will not enforce them for us.”
—Prime Minister Bruce at Gympie (Q.).
The Prime Minister is learning the art of
war in the face of the. enemy, as Redvers
Buller was said to do in South Africa, and
certainly his lower jaw sticks out further than
it did. But it doesn’t yet stick out as far
as the jaw of a commander-in-chief ought to.
It is gratifying to hear it laid down that the
supreme Government of Australia possesses
an inherent right to protect its subjects from
wrong and outrage, quite apart from the
right, mentioned in clause 119 of the Con-
stitution, to interfere in cases of internal
disorder provided the State Ministry js pre-
pared to risk its job and possibly its life by
asking for assistance. But there is too much
half-lieartedness in the promise that a cer-
tain law will be passed “if the State Govern-
ments refuse protection.” Some State Gov-
ernments have refused protection; and the
law should be made a definite thing so as
to be ready next time, and any time. As
the matter is expressed it seems as if there
might be a partial and temporary reform in
the worst quarters, and that the offenders
might “purge themselves of their contempt,”
as Johanson did when he threw himself
on the mercy of the Court, and the proposed
Federal law might thereupon be dropped.
Then when disorder resumed business at the
old address the chances are that another 12
months of trouble would be required to heat
up the furnace of Bruce’s wrath afresh.
But even if a Federal law is passed making-
certain varieties of disorder more definitely
criminal than tliev are, there is no assurance
that Federal police will be provided to
arrest offenders, and Federal courts to try
them, and Federal gaols to contain them. State
police hold precarious jobs, and —in Queens-
land, anyhow—State Judges and magistrates
are removable by the vote of one House, and
though clause 120 of the Constitution says
that State gaols shall hold Federal offenders
the experience of Westralia shows that they
don’t. Australia requires a better army, a
well-organised Federal police force, its own
outfit of civil and criminal law, and its own
courts. Then, lest the courts should be idle,
and should take to frequenting pubs and bad
company the unused powers of the Common-
wealth should be taken over in their entirety
and as soon as possible to furnish them with
honest employment.
The Ghost of Old Decentralisation.
\ remark concerning decentralisation, almost
too bashful and retiring to be visible, has
appeared on the N.S.W. Government s pro-
gramme. It is proposed to have another
look at the idea of adding 60 miles to the
unfinished Sydney-Bombala railway (320
miles long and bringing up at. a dead-end),
so that it would arrive at the deep-water
port of Twofold Bay, where there might be
traffic on a big scale, instead of staying at
a village in the bracing atmosphere of
the hills, where there isn’t anything wortn
mentioning and the little bit there is gets
less. It isn’t really anticipated that, there
will be any decentralisation until the
cumbersome Ma State is subdivided into
at least three, but it is pleasant to see the
happy, hoary hypocrisy doing another run.
Every Government takes a turn at it, and
they are all equally unconvincing. Mean-
while there is the same old lack of new
population except in the County of Cumber-
land (which is mostly. Sydney) and (to a
small extent) on the Newcastle coalfields,
and ports like Twofold Bay, Jervis Bay,
Port Stephens, Coff’s Harbor and the Clar-
ence, where new cities should be rising,
stagnate in the old way for lack of com-
munication with their natural hinterland,
and through the absence of other facilities.
Railways are constantly being built with
costly loan money, but they.dodge handy out-
lying ports with fiendish ingenuity, and
take their cargoes over the most impossible
distances, and at absurd cost, to the city,
it being an axiom that the more people there
are in the city, and the more families that
lead the obscene one-room life as a conse-
quence about Paddington and in Surry Hills,
the greater is the aggregate progress. One
reason why the freak railways lose money
is that rates have to be cut to make up for
superfluous distances traversed in dodging
some next-door outlet like Twofold Bay in
order that the trade may go to one 200 or
250 miles further away. And one reason
why they don’t promote settlement is that
the haulage costs too much even after the
rates have been cut. In consequence the Ma
State’s new annual Railway Report, just
out, compares with its predecessor in this
wise:—
N.S.W. had 5655 miles of line working at June
30, 1925, and of these 3586 miles were losing
money, as against 3545 miles of money-losers a
year earlier.
There were 55 separate lines or sections, varying
in length from three miles to 224 miles, which
failed to pay full interest and working expenses.
Of these 30 paid no interest at all and failed to
cover expenses in addition. A year earlier the
utter derelicts numbered 27.
Five separate lines lost over £IOO,OOO each,
as against one such line the previous year. The
biggest single loss was £146,836. When it is
suggested that the Commonwealth should keep faith,
and develop its magnificent Northern Territory
property by completing the railway across it, anti-
Federal obstructionists raise a melanchdly Wail
about the losses made on the unfinished bit of • line
which exists up there already—the 200 miles from
Darwin to the Katherine. The amount which it
lost during the last available year was £66,019.
N.S.W. not only broke that record in five places,
but contrived to lose twice as much on a line only
1104 miles long.
One good loser drops £2299 per mile per annum,
and is capable of dropping the whole of itself in
54 years. A better one goes wrong for about £3400
per mile per annum, and can eat itself up in six
years and a fraction.
The total amount lost last year on N.S.W.’s list
of bankrupt railways was £1,505,010, or £419
per mile. The year before the loss was £1,196,364.
One assured cause of the trouble is the exist-
ence of too many dead ends like Bombala
among the salubrious hills, which contribute
little to the railway revenue because they
are dead, and are contributing less than
they did because they reckon tlieir
deadness lias come to stay. Another
cause is the existence of too many
ports like Twofold Bay, which contribute
nothing because the cities which might be
there are prevented by premeditated isola-
tion. Sydney and other places pay enough
in superfluous charges to square the. rail-
way accounts fairly well, and the capital
gets its reward in more overcrowding, more
slumminess, higher rents, and more street
accidents. The result may be worth paying
for, but doubts can’t be wholly suppressed.

Charlton’s Naval Programme.
“It has been shown on authoritative evidence that
Australia could have 16 submarines for the cost of
one cruiser, that these need no expensive bases, and
that they are particularly suitable to our needs and
our resources.”
This statement was made by Federal Labor-
leader Charlton in his policy-speech, and
represents the fundamental principle upon
which this country’s naval defence will be
based in the event of Labor being returned
to office. Now what are the ascertainable
facts? A 10,000-ton cruiser, the largest per-
missible under the provisions of the Wash-
ington Conference, costs approximately
£2,000,000, so that the Federal Labor-
leader’s submarines are going to cost only
£125,000 apiece. As XI. the last submarine
completed in Great Britain, is known to have
cost at least £900,000, and is suspected to
have cost well over £1,000,000, it would be
interesting if Charlton would divulge where,
and by whom, his £125,000 craft are to be
built. In view of the statement that sub-
marines are “particularly suitable to our
needs,” it is significant that Britain, whose
naval-defence problem is identical with Aus-
tralia’s —only not so acute —is so little con-
vinced of their value that she has built only
one in the last seven years. The fact is
that small, and therefore cheap, submarines
which can only have a poor torpedo-carrying
capacity, with slow speed and consequent
restricted radius of action, are utterly value-
less. Since the Armistice enormous strides
have been made in perfecting various anti-
submarine devices, and only fast, powerful
submarines, armed with heavy guns, carrying
a large number of torpedoes, and able to
keep the sea for several days in all kinds of
weather, can hope to survive. The hydro-
phone, by which the position of a submerged
submarine can be detected even when she is
several miles distant, has been systemati-
cally developed, until to-day the small “har-
bor-defence” submarine would stand no
chance against a squadron of well-armed
surface ships fitted with these instruments.
Only ocean-going submarines, costing at least
half a million sterling, and with a large
cruising radius and high speed, can hope to
fulfil a useful function in the next war.
These are facts fully acknowledged by Brit-
ish naval submarine officers themselves, and
no more “authoritative evidence” could be
adduced. But even if Australia were pro-
vided with a score of these large submarines,
at a cost of approximately £10,000,000, bases
—and not such modest, inexpensive little
bases either —would have to be provided for
them. Moreover, several of these bases would
be needed if anything like adequate protec-
tion was to be afforded Australia’s 14,000
miles of coast, and each base would have to
be equipped with a floating-dock, repair
shops, and all the rest of the paraphernalia
of a submarine dockyard. A permanent staff
of skilled workmen would have to be enlisted,
and efficient protection, in the way of shore-
batteries, provided for each case. This would
not be facilitated by the fact that, compul-
sory military service having been abolished,
less than 2000' trained soldiers would be
available to man the guns. At present there
are very few R.A.N. officers and practically
no R.A.N. ratings with any submarine ex-
perience, and without borrowing from the
R.N. it is doubtful if enough men could be
found in Australia to man two submarines.
Efficient crews could not be trained for these
craft in less than seven years, and mean-
while Australia would have to either remain
navally defenceless or else borrow the neces-
sarv men from J. Bull. As Charlton’s*.
whole policy of parochial defence is diametri-
cally opposed to J. Bull’s scheme of co-
operative Imperial defence, it is most un-
likely that he would supply the men. Neville
Howse, Federal Minister for Defence, has
bluntly said that “it is mere drivel to talk,
of a handful of people, such as we are, being:
able to defend this immense continent against
other Pacific Powers,” and anyone who has-
given the matter a moment’s thought must
agree with him. The suggestion that sub-
marines alone, either ocean-going or other-
wise, could, unsupported by surface-craft,,
stop even the most inefficient and muddle-
headed invader from walking ashore when-
ever he felt inclined is simply ridiculous.

More Fair Kents.
With an enduring faith in the frontal attack
the N.S.W. Government has introduced an-
other Fair Rents Bill, and the document pro-
mises to make an end of the construction
of small homes for letting. The old measure,
which lias been at work in Sydney since
March, 1916, and in the rest of the State
since August, 1920, was a considerable dis-
courager of building. It restricted rents,
made them harder to collect, and made it so
difficult to get rid of a destructive tenant
that he could stay on rent-free for a long
time before going out and possibly making;
way for another of the same type—disadvan-
tages that were combined with increased cost
of construction and an increased tendency
to throw mud at the landlord. In fact, the
policy was, not to promote the building of
new homes and make them something of a
drug in the market, but to greatly add to
the demand where land is dearest, and to
sit hard on the supply. As the population
of Sydney grew by some 256,000 from the
beginning of the Act to date, it naturally
followed that the habit of having one family,
sometimes a grossly rack-rented family, m
each sublet room of a working-class suburb,
and possibly a tenant on the sublet balcony,
became a growing one. Something might be
done if the Government developed the courage
to enact that every citizen with an income of,
say, £6OO a year from politics or otherwise
should, under pain of disfranchisement, build
and let at least one humble but comfortable
home, provided he hadn’t done so already.
In other words, something might be achieved
if certain noisy persons did their share to
meet the house shortage. The attitude of
the loud speaker who says that there ought
to be more landlords, who refuses to become
a landlord, and who heaps contumely on
those who are landlords, isn’t helpful, nor is
it beautiful. In Britain a somewhat differ-
ent course has been adopted. That troubled
land did a good deal in the way of Fair
Rents legislation, but it didn’t trust nearly
so much to the policy of kicking the old'
landlord to cheer him up. Instead it subsi-
dised building, and aimed at “a fixed output
of houses” of a good type and suited to
working-class tenants. Each approved new
house was pensioned to the extent of £6 a
year for 20 years, the money going to the
person who paid the rates, which person is
the tenant according to British custom. As
an alternative the shanty might get its legacy
as a lump sum. Municipal authorities do
the building, either personally or by deputy.
It is probably rotten political economics, but
the scheme produces houses, and the bill is
paid each year out of revenue. But some-
thing more even than that would be needed
in N. S. Wales. Population isn’t growing
there at such an extraordinary rate as to
account in any legitimate way for all the
house famine and house hysteria that exist.
An increase of one-seventh part of a person
per square mile, or one person (probably a
baby) per seven square miles, in a year
should be easy to find accommodation for,
and the number is sometimes less than that.
Unfortunately it was a matter last year of
finding space for 30,670 new people in Syd-
ney alone, or, rather, of finding space for
100,000, being 30,670 who wanted new
homes, and 69,330 who ought to have been
ejected from decayed old homes to make
way for improvements. Just because a mil-
lion persons in one city which is big enough
to be a disease pile up vastly more unim-
proved land value than the same number dis-
persed among 20 rising young towns, the
ordinary bit of soil on which the ordinary
citizen lives his ordinary existence is priced
at several times as much as it need be, and
rents are to correspond. The upward move-
ment is continuous, and it is doubtful if
20 Lang Ministries, toiling for 20 years,
could find an adequate remedy except by
strenuously promoting the growth of rival
seaports to relieve the pressure.

Labor and Wool.
True enough, country people can be queer
birds. One has heard from them so much
protest and palaver over the iniquity of
centralisation that one is almost bored by a
good cause. Yet observe their own latest,
but not only, offence in the matter. A com-
pany which, if not a scion of the Graziers’
Association, has its friendship, is receiving
thousands of bales of wool into its city
warehouse for expert sorting prior to offer-
ing. Nobody can object to sorting the wool
up to its highest commercial utility; but
why bring it to the city? Why deny labor
the right to do rural work in rural dis-
tricts? The position is doubly bad because
the plan of centralising the job is injurious
to the country and to the wool. Laying aside
for the time being the national aspect of
the matter, wool which is re-handled in the
city atmosphere loses its first bloom and
freshness and deteriorates in attractiveness.
Wool-buyers in appraising their prospective
purchases will always write down the yield
of wool so treated: and repacking dealers,
who live by the business of re-sorting, know
full well that they must buy so as to allow
of re-sale on an inferior basis. There is, in
fact, only one place for the preparation ot
wool for market. That is in the shearing-
shed. Why not use it? There comes, ot
course, the answer that the country does not
give the facilities for expert work, and that
the class of labor available is unsatisfactory.
Whose fault is that? The wool-grower has
carried on for scores of years with a casual,
unskilled, migratory type of labor to which
he lias entrusted a large proportion ot the
Vr.alling of his golden fleece. If it has always

THAT ALWAYS LEAVES
A PLEASANT MEMORY
been inefficient why has he never tried to
supplant it with proficient workmen, skilled
in their trade, who can really sort the wool
instead of merely picking it over? These
inen may be a little more expensive, but
they would work out much cheaper; and, in
any case,. by sending his produce to this
company in Sydney (whose work, by the
way, is not to be disparaged), the pastoralist
is paying the highest wages. The wool-
grower has never given the superior method
of employing the same type of labor at
home a trial. He has never encouraged
..superior labor to go out to him. Even wool-
classers, who personally handle the bulk and
the cream of a man’s clip, are woefully under-
paid. Theirs is an important work, a skilled
occupation and a seasonal one. But it is a
lucky wool-classer (and a scarce one) who
could live on his earnings in shearing-sheds.
Most of them depend on work obtained
hundreds of miles from where the wool is
shorn. It is a paradoxical characteristic of
the pastoralist that he will give the full 12
months’ labor and deliberation to the grow-
ing of his clip, but when the time comes
round for it to be shorn the whole operation
is put through with excessive haste and
usually under the crudest conditions. And
so. because wool is not a big wagepaycr or
labor absorbent, grazing lands are put under
the plough for the production of bigger wage-
sustaining grain, which the railways have to
carry at a loss. Because wheat employs most
of its labor at the seat of production there
is logic in the encouragement of its growth :
but there is no reason why wool should not
be in the same position—and to the benefit of
the grower.
A European Peace Pact,
Amidst much pleasing ceremonial, the Allies
in the Great. War and their chief antagonist
last week signed at Locarno, in Switzerland,
the long-sought security pact. Under it Ger-
many, France and Belgium pledge them-
selves to refrain from picking up the bomb
except in self-defence. Germany accepts
the status quo on her western frontier, in-
cluding the demilitarised zones, but reserves
the right to argue before the League the
rights and wrongs of her eastern boundary,
where things are so mixed that there 'is
reckoned to be a casus belli to the acre.
The Allies promise to smile upon the
application to enter the League which Ger-
many proposes to make if she is
exempted from the obligations placed
on members to make war on aggres-
sor States at the order of the League.
Arbitration treaties have been signed between
the States most liable to fly at each other’s
throats, and the League is to be appealed to
in the last resort. Britain’s part is to guaran-
tee the arbitration treaties between France.
Germany and Belgium. The pact, it is
stated, does not commit the Dominions, but
in view of happenings in the past this
assurance will bring little comfort overseas.
Although the pact is not all that could In'
desired, and although there is a suspicion
that Germany played a threat to join hands
with Soviet Russia as her trump card, the
arrangement may give Europe a breathing-
space in which to put her house in order, an
operation that calls for prompt attention.

The Sins of the Commonwealth Bank.
Matthew Charlton and his friends con-
tinue to make violent attacks on the Com-
monwealth Bank and its non-political con-
trol : under the blessed rule of the Soviet
presumably the politician will be supreme,
no matter whether he has had any training
for the job or not. As far as can be made
out of the jumble of vague assertion and
vituperation, the chief offence of the bank,
as the authority in charge of the note issue,
is that it “capitulated” to the private banks
and granted them £15,000,000 of notes “to
relieve the market and permit the movement
of g00d5.... The notes were issued to the
private banks at 4 p.c., and reloaned at 7
p.c. There was not a farmer or business
man could secure from the Commonwealth
Bank money on such terms. The privilege
was for private banks only.” There is only
on e thing wrong about this : it is all untrue.
The notes were not issued to the private
banks at 4 p.c. They were not issued at
all. Not one single note. What happened
was that the private banks were offered the
special accommodation that some of them
said was necessary on certain terms. John
Garvan, the chairman of the Board, was
opposed to inflation by the increase of paper
money. Perhaps lie remembered what Theo-
dore had said just previously: “Wages are
always less than they should be in countries
that practise inflation.” At any rate, he
was opposed to the increase of paper money.
“But,” he said —and the Board agreed with
him—“if, as you assert, more notes are
needed for the purpose of handling this wool
and wheat harvest, we will issue £15,000.000
worth on condition that you hand them back
to us as soon as the wool and wheat harvest
has been disposed of”—well inside 12
that is. The offer was thus made for a
specific purpose; and that the Board was
right in believing that extra notes were not
wanted at all was shown by the fact that
not a note was called for!

An Australian Hot-air Service.
The large aerial defence force mentioned in
Charlton’s policy speech has much to re-
commend it. The aeroplane is the one means
available by which for land-defence purposes
a comparatively small nation can multiply
its fighting strength and keep its eyes on an
extensive and almost empty shore line. But
why in the same breath propose to create an
effective air force and do away with uni-
versal service? If the training of infantry
is not regarded as worth while, why not
make some attempt to bring into existence
universal air training? All young men may
not be fliers, but those who can’t learn to bo
pilots could be taught to fill other posts and
at least learn something about the mechani-
cal side of the work. Flying men take a
good deal of making; and without them an
air service isn’t of much account. The
scheme would have the tremendous advan-
tage of bringing into our system of defence
the men who are found in small groups far
from centres of population. These are in
many cases Australia’s very best; and at a
wireless call there might be a great gather-
ing of wings from far stations and remote
townships bearing men who under other cir-
cumstances would take weeks and months
to muster. Leaving the manning to chance
and the service to politicians’ pre-election
rhetoric is about the surest way to make it
ineffective. As matters stand many trained
fliers who learned the business under war
conditions have been made no use of since
the war ended. The instruction they might
have given has been lost to hosts of younger

Attorney-General Mullan discovered the

cause your amending Act removed all dis-
qualifications,” retorted the inspector. “It
did nothing of the kind,” declared Mullan.
He was right there. The Jury Act Amend-
ment Act abolished the property qualifica-
tion and cut out some of the exemptions
(justices of the peace and journalists, for
example, are now liable for jury service;
women also are eligible if they desire to
serve). But the Act did not touch the
disqualifications. Persons convicted of
“treason, felony or infamous crime” are
still disqualified; also undischarged insol-
vents. On investigating, the Attorney-
General found that his sheriffs had taken
the same view as the police inspector, and
had called convicted men to serve on juries.
The police, thinking this was the queer new
law, had merely grumbled among themselves
and let the convicts pass unchallenged to
sit in judgment on their fellows. At one
criminal trial in Brisbane the “12 good
men and true” included three old lags, one of
whom had received sentences aggregating 20
years. The jury disagreed. The Judge won-
dered why, but the police knew. A fresh
trial before a “clean-skin” jury ended speedily
in conviction, and the prisoner “went-up”
for five years. The police reports on the
jury lists were startling. One officer, flipping
over the lists, picked out the names of over 100
convicted men. The lists have now been cleaned
up, and the prisoner at the bar can no longer
count on having a friend or two in the
jury-box. There are men walking about
Queensland to-day thanking their lucky
stars that Mullan did not make his dis-
covery sooner.
“X.N.0.”: The appreciative article oh the
Jervis Bay Naval College by a father of one
of the boys (B. 8/10/’25) is worthy of
appreciation in itself. It is inspired obvi-
ously by two influences —enthusiasm for the
lire his boy is leading and is going to lead
and a readiness on his own and his boy’s
part to sacrifice “for the good of the service”
—which means “for the good of Australia”—
the more manifest opportunities that exist
ashore for making money commercially or
professionally. For the Navy is not a ser-
vice in which money can be made, and it is
a service as distinct from a profession. Two
questions can be asked in a service regarding
any innovation or course of action either by
an individual or by the service as a whole.
First, “Is it for the good of the service?”
And. second. “How does it affect the indivi-
dual?” If the answer to the first question is
“No,” then the second should not be asked.
In a profession the order may be—and nearly
always is—reversed. Modern trade unionism
invariably puts the individual, either as an
individual or as a “class,” first. The Austra-
lian father answers the first question satis-
factorily when he says “nor can a parent
regret giving up his son to such a service.”
In other words: “I am glad to subordinate
my son’s individual interest where necessary
for the good of the service.” And the whole
of the article answers the second question,
for he bases the benefit to his son on the
“splendid moulding of character” to which
Jervis Bay subjects the individual. Would
that there were more men able to write with
such obvious sincerity, and would that there
were more men, women, young men and
young women equally ready to subordinate
their individual preferences to the good of
their country!

Victoria’s Full Court disposed the other
day of the protracted appeal of Phillips,
wliarf-laborer, who may now consider him-
self an extinguished character. In the
middle of last year Phillips was reported
by the union’s watcher for doing excessive
work, and the union fined the scoundrel 10s.
Being of an insufficiently humble disposi-
tion. he failed to pay, in consequence of
which employers were notified that he was
no longer a member of the union and mustn’t
be employed any more. His claim for rein-
statement was met by the plea that he had
subscribed to the rules by becoming a mem-
ber, and that under that short and simple
code the union committee might impose such
punishment as it saw fit. On the other side
it was suggested that this was rather ridi-
culous, as Phillips might have been hanged
under the rules, and that allowance Should
be made for the fact that, members joined
unions under dire compulsion, just as they
joined the only authentic church in past
ages, there being no habitable place outside.
The Full Court decided, as the I’artially-
Fmpty Court had done previously, that it
had been given no power to interfere. It
would be interesting if the same methods
were applied to the legal trades union. Their
Honors joined up compulsorily in their
younger days else they could never have
climbed to the Bench, and to be suddenly
and indefinitely suspended on the report of
a walking delegate might interfere with their
usefulness now.
_♦
“Caiitot” : The dissolution of the Common-
wealth Parliament has postponed any chance
of the immediate correction of an anomaly
in the international status of Australian
women who marry foreigners, As the law
stands the women of this country are at a
greater disadvantage than those of any other
especially in the event of their marrying
Americans. Our law deprives the bride of
Australian nationality, while a law of Con-
gress says that she shall not acquire
American nationality by the mere fact of
her marriage, but only by process of staying
in the country for three years and becoming
naturalised in the ordinary way. In the
interim she is neither Australian, British
nor American, a serious handicap to
her should she be travelling in other
countries and require to get her passports
and other credentials visaed. Almost every
country except Australia has attended of
late years to such anomalies.
“Gregor” : A perpetual and quite inad-
equately recognised menace to Australia is
the existence on this country’s back doorstep
of the undeveloped territory of Dutch New
Guinea. For 80-odd years this region has
belonged to the Netherlands, and in that
time nothing has been done to explore and
exploit its potentialities. Save for a few
small settlements and a military post here
and there it is still swamp and jungle. There
is a mere handful of Europeans in the coun-
try, most of them paradise-bird hunters, who
go out from Merauke and Hollandia in search
of the plumes on which the colony depends
for some two-thirds of its revenue. Yet this
Dutch territory, with its estimated 150,000
square miles, occupies more than half of
New Guinea, being greater than the Man-
dated Territory and Papua together. Sooner
or later its undoubted wealth of tropical
products must attract the attention of inves-
tors. Indeed it is doing so already. Some
months ago a German princeling came into
the field with a scheme for obtaining a char-
ter from the Dutch Government and forming
a chartered company. The project fell
through, but now there is some talk of a
joint enterprise of Dutch and American —
probably Germ an-American —capital, and
almost any day Australians may awake to
find a horde of colored Asiatic! labor dumped
down to assist in the development of this huge
territory. The multiplicity of problems and
dangers arising from such a situation needs
no _ emphasis. The White Australia policy,
which is as this country’s life-blood, would be
jeopardised by a constant infiltration through
our unguarded Northern gates from a base
on the other side of Torres Strait. The
remedy might lie in representation to the
League of Nations that the Commonwealth
is entitled to a voice in the future of Dutch
New Guinea.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Just when the British embargo on new
Dominion loans showed signs of lifting, and
the Australian States were breasting the
tape, the prohibition was renewed. The fact
is J. Bull is short of money, especially money
for lending to embarrassed States which
have given up paying interest except out of
the proceeds of new loans, so that there is
nothing coming to him save another batch
of lOU’s. These hitches are becoming too
frequent to be pleasant for six Governments
which had settled down comfortably to bor-
row some £33,000,000 per annum abroad
and something here to boot. The Yankee
market shows no desire for State loans, and
even the brief popularity of Australian Fede-
ral securities in New York has waned.
After one £15,000,000 transaction the loan
syndicate dissolved and the bonds went to
a discount. It almost looks as if the jag
was over and the jig finished.
Charlton and his party continue to protest
that they are not Communists. But that is
not the charge against them. The charge is
that they are either assisting or not resisting
the forces of disorder. During the past week
the tJlimaroa was to have left Sydney for
Maoriland. All the passengers were on board
and everything was ready for casting off
when, in defiance of the recent undertaking
that there*would be no more job control, the
crew made a pretext of some dispute about
overtime to lay the vessel up. The pas-
sengers were kept on board for a day; then,
the situation being apparently hopeless, their
passage-money was refunded and the sailing
was cancelled. There was not a sign of a
union protest against the violation of the no-
job-control agreement. Not a Labor leader
rushed down to the wdiarf and thundered
curses upon the crew. Not a Labor leader
has thrashed the bosses of the Coal Lumpers’
Union for holding up the Orvieto, whose only
offence is that it has a union crew on board.
Whether Charlton is a Communist is of no
consequence. A party which takes no action
against such men, but rather angles for their
votes, would smell as bad by any other name.
The N.S.W. Upper House did irreparable
damage to the bill for the abolition of capi-
tal punishment, whereupon Premier Lang
made the obvious remark, and called that
Chamber, into which the Storey-Dooley Min-
istry crammed so many trades-union secret
taries and into which other trades-union
agents have been dropped at odd times for
tile last 80 years, a haunt of the idle rich.
Lang is nothing if not obvious. In a speech
dotted With the words “democracy” and / tie-
in oefutid” he foreshadowed the demolition
of the nominee relic, but being asked if he
Would take a democratic referendum on the

Bidding, for tlie grain-grower’s vote,
Matthew Charlton spoke severely about the
exorbitant prices demanded by middlemen for
their wheat sacks,” and undertook to arrange,
“through direct Commonwealth agency,” for
“adequate supplies of jute gopds to be re-
tailed to producers at cost prices. Dunn,
the N.S.W. Labor Minister of Agriculture,
has just shown what a boon this will be.
In reply to Bavin, the dour Opposition-leader,
he admitted having bought 5000 bales of
cornsacks “in the interests of the farmers
at 14s. sd. a dozen and sold them at 12s.
6d. He brightly explained, however, that the
taxpayer would have lost more than £12,000
if lie, Dunn, hadn’t made “judicious in-
quiries” before buying and effected a masterly
sale. With a little more encouragement the
gentleman would have warmly congratulated
the taxpayers on tlie favor he had conferred
upon them by losing their £12.000.
The Labor party has of late years never
been scrupulous US
regards vote-catch-
ing, but in trying
to make an election
issue of Spalilingei*
it has got rigat
down to the gutter.
It seems that Mat-
thew Charlton saw
Spalilinger in Swit-
zerland and found
him “badly in need
of assistance,” but
”n o t w i t h standing
my strong repre-
sentations the Gov-
ernment remains
adamant in its de-
termination not to
assist in this direc-
tion for the allevia-
tion of the suffer-
ings of mankind.”
1-lowse, the Minis-
ter of Health, also
saw Spahlinger in
Switzerland; an d
his report is that
Spahlinger has
been in a position
to get unlimited
funds from the Bri-
ti s h Government
(Macdonald’s a s
well as Baldwin’s),
the League of Na--
tions, the U.S.A.
and the Red Cross
conditionally on liis
submitting liis
treatment to an in-
dependent test and
furnishing evi-
dence of the cures
he claims .to have
made, which con-
ditions have b.een
persistently reject-
ed. The Labor idea
seems to be that
15,000 or 20,000
votes may be gain-
ed by inflaming the
minds of consump-
tives against the
Government, which
has merely refrain-
ed from rushing in
wlie r e European
and American Gov-
ernments fear to
tread; but it is a cruel development of party
politics.
A Labor stalwart, justifying Matthew
Charlton’s no-Defenee policy, asserts that the
great lesson of the late war lias been lost
on all but Labor. The lesson, it seems, _is
that one volunteer, after a few months’ train-
ing, is equal to two conscripts. In the late
war unprepared Britain’s first volunteer
army was trained behind the lines held by
French conscripts; and it was behind the
trenches held by French and British con-
scripts that Uncle Sam prepared his regi-
ments.
In five years the Vic. public debt has
increased by no less than £48,521,825. The
total on June 30 was £131,169,564, and
£25,400,000 of it was not returning interest.
Compared with 1923-24 the increase in loan
liability was £7,016,030, and in interest
£238,124; at the end of the year the interest
burden had reached £5,903,139. National
danger does not lie only in the size and
growth of the burden of debt. It lies also
in- the fact that the more we borrow and
spend the larger grows the army of public
servants who exercise control over the Gov-
ernment which should control them. Queens-
land is the dreadful example; but all the
States are fast going the same way.
It has been decreed in Westralia that the
Controller of Prisons may exempt any pri-
soner from wearing' gaol attire, may order
him special dietary, and may otherwise relax
the rules at discretion, In other words, if
the Federal authority gets a man sentenced
id gaol, the. State. Government may turn it
into a picnic for him,
The , British Government was lately taken
with dark suspicions of its leading Commu-
nists, and with a hunger for evidence about
their doings. So it sent its police to raid
Communist centres in London and the pro-
vinces, arrested leading exponents of revolu-
tion, and seized all available books and docu-
ments in its quest for information. It raided
private houses in its haste, and “violated the
sanctity of the home.” It doesn’t half know
how to do things. It ought to have appointed
a Board to listen to the examination of
3796 witnesses by Andy Watt.
Vic.’s surplus for 1924-25 was £109,404.
There was a railway deficit of £269,672, but
Treasury payments of £295,359 converted
this into a surplus of £25,686. The two
principal Treasury payments to the Rail-
ways were £155,000 for losses incurred owing
to the 10 per cent, reduction on agricultural

products, and £135,289 for non-paying lines.
In scrutinising the details, Auditor-General
Norris expressed the fear that “increased
drawings on taxation and general revenue
may prove embarrassing in less prosperous
periods and add to the difficulty of curtailing
expenditure, which includes large and grow-
ing costs for interest and redemption.” And
the fear is only too well founded.
Tas. Treasurer Lvons reports an £86,000
surplus on the year s transactions, but is not
unduly puffed up in consequence. It
merely means that the accumulated deficit
with which he started the financial year has
been reduced to £422,772, and this floating
horror is “exclusive of loss on Settle-
ment, Closer Settlement and Ships.” As
these unaudited .losses may be anything be-
tween half a million and three-quarters of a
million, Treasurer Lyons’s little surplus for
the year is a very small drop in a very large
bucket. Still, the fact that Lyons has bal-
anced revenue and expenditure for one year
is a welcome change for Tasmania.
The Orient Co.’s Orvieto lies week after-
week in Sydney Harbor, its sole offence being:
that it shipped a union crew in England-
It is laid up because, coerced by the Austra-
lian Seamen’s Union, the lumpers refuse to*
coal the vessel —refuse to coal it because it
has a union crew on board. No comic opera
ever contained a madder situation. But
there is tragedy behind it—the tragedy of
Australian unions allowing themselves to be
made the tools of lunatics or criminals, and in-
flicting terrible losses upon employers for
doing precisely what the unions ask them to do.
Though he shows a sort of a surplus for
last year, Tas. Treasurer Lyons cannot see
his way to budget for anything but a deficit
this year. He reckons his revenue will fall
off by £140,000 —mostly income-tax—and
the closest cheeseparing in expenditure is
estimated to land him with a deficit for
1925-26' of £62,000. On top of this uncheer-
ful outlook there is the continued exodus of
population to the mainland, which of course
means that there will be a bigger falling off
of revenue two years hence unless something
unforeseen happens to reverse the tide. We
must all pay for the war and war-time extra-
vagance. Small Sister, because she is so>
very small, is the first to feel the burden..
Apparently the family will have to double-
Small Sister’s per capita ration to enable
her to pull through.
Kalgoorlie, which elected a Nationalist in*.
1917, a Laborite in 1919, another National -
ist in 1920 (after the expulsion of Mahon)’
and another Laborite in 1922, seems likely
to change its mind again next month. Dur-
ing the last three years there has been a
shrinkage of over 2000 in the electoral popu-
lation of the goldfields, which gave “Texas”’
Green nearly all his majority of 2555; on
the other hand, agricultural and pastoral
settlement has steadily increased —there are
wheat-farmers at Southern Cross now.
Again, the cockies and sheepmen had so little
use for the rather blatant Foley that only
1360 electors out of 4428 enrolled marked
ballot-papers in the Irwiu and Gascoyne
subdivisions, which should have been _ his;
strongholds. Voting is cumpulsory this time.
What is more, the Country party, having ai
bone to pick with “Texas” over the intermin-
able transport strikes, which are death to-
Westralian industries, is actively supporting;
Mullany.
In 1917 the Nationalists won all the West-
ralian Federal seats, and now that Jarrah-
land has to thank the Communist bosses of
the Seamen’s Union and the Collier or Cock-
tail Cabinet for depriving it of its extensive-
S’African trade and the British steamers
that used to call at Fremantle, the party has
a great chance of repeating the achievement.
It would be a Certainty with a good local
campaign leader, but Pearce is more hin-
drance than help. The Nats, would be hap-
pier if Pearce and Wilson (S.A.) could have-
changed places. Wilson is one of four Minis-
terial candidates battling for three vacancies.
Still, S. Aus. Laborites regard him as then-
most dangerous enemy, in spite of his being;
No. 4on the Ministerial ticket. One of them
writes: — . TI
Grip and grit are his salient characteristics. He
has a strong personal following, not only in the city
but in the country. He will get many flrst-preference-
votes from both parties—Liberal and Country That
is why it is ever so necessary for our boys to puli,
together.
The unusually frank tribute is from a South
Aus. correspondent of Sydney Worker.
Conciliation was a feature of the indus-
trial arbitration system first introduced
into Australia, but it soon fell into disuse.
The N.S.W. Labor Government has gone-
back to the old love in the Amending Arbi-
tration Bill, now before Parliament; there
are to be conciliation committees, with paid
chairmen and a commissioner to attend to
appeals, instead of the present Industrial
Courts and the Board of Trade. And, to
show that it is suffused with the concilia-
tion spirit, the Government is deregistering
a number of unions whose crime is that
they do their job peacefully and refuse to
have any truck with the Communist-bossed
Trades and Labor Council or the A. UP. A
wise Government would preserve the anti-
strike railway unions in view of what has
just happened in Queensland; they would
certainly be a safeguard against a N.S.W..
repetition of that disaster. But the crowd
in office is blind, vindictive and hopelessly
thick in the skull.
The N.S.W. Labor Government is opposed
to capital punishment; nevertheless—
The Council killed the bill to end the killing
By Ketch of such as innocent blood have spilled ;
Wherefore, if Lang can find a hangman -willing,
Itself is to be killed.

THE NEW ARMY:
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
‘4he election of officers by the rank and file ■will
be a novel feature of Australia’s new array if < Labor
wins the Federal elections, according to Senator
Gardiner, who addressed a meeting at Hurstville last
night. ‘Officers will not be saluted,’ he remarked,
and other ‘useless disciplinary practices will go.’”
Said the Candidate: “I wish to state,
if I should be elected,
I will not rile the rank and file
By whom I am selected.
“Our latest plan says every man
Shall vote on any measure
That may appear to interfere
With his accustomed leisure.
“So, should you please to stand at ease
When you are asked to double,
I will agree that you are free
To save yourselves the trouble.
“We're out to kill all fancy frill—
Good discipline and such-like;
Well stand no jaw about the Law
When we declare a Dutch strike.
“We hold ‘Red Tabs’ are ’orty scabs,
Of Duty always bleatin’;
They’d steal your right, in any fight,
To hold a stop-work meetinl
“But us new blokes will stand no jokes
From upstarts trained at college
Who want the job to teach our mob
Their military knowledge.
“So Vote for me and no C.B,
When you want leave just take it;
The law’s an ass that says a pass
is needful, so just break it.
“And one thing more: if there is war
Leave fightin* to the barmy—
Save when the heads of all the Reds
Call out our noble army.
"Then vote our way on pollin’ day
With postal votes an’ proxies;
We’re out to win, an’ it’s no sin
To fake the ballot-boxes.”

The undivided profit is stated approximately
because the exact amount of the final divi-
dend on the ordinary shares is not ascertain-
able. The net additions to all the reserves
are reckoned in the first table as profit. Pro-
bably they are; but it cannot be said defi-
nitely. It all depends upon what provision
has been made apart from these reserves for
depreciation, etc. Neither the balance-sheet
nor the Appropriation account helps much;
but it certainly looks as though these re-
serves are contingency accounts, and that pro-
vision for ordinary shrinkages has been made
elsewhere. If there are special and unfore-
seen calls, these reserves must of course bear
them. Thus during the past year there was
evidently a call of £7724 on the taxation re-
serve ; that account was eaten into for that
amount—which, incidentally, explains the
difference between the profit of £193,230
claimed by the published accounts and the
£185,506 of the table at the top of these
remarks.
When the accounts were closed capital was
£492,500 in 200 000 prefs. and 292.500 ordi-
naries, 97,500 of the latter issued in Febru-
ary. Last month authorised capital was
increased to a round million and 175 500
new £1 ordinaries brought paid capital to
£668,000. Issues have been so rapid that
the latest lot of ordinaries sent to market
exceeds in itself the total capital of only
two years ago. Such progress is probably
unparalleled in Australian industrial history.
Profits have bounded along also, but the
directors have not distributed them lavishly:
shareholders have been treated generously,
but the bulk of profits have been sent to
reserves —a policy worthy of a cheer. A
few others might be given for the expan-
sion shown by these figures:—

Last year the balance-sheet total shot over
the million mark; let the exact figure be
recorded—£l,o7l,662. Just four years ago
it was only one-fifth as much. The next
table shows the quick movement from other
points of view :

Further increases in production are antici-
pated : the growing popularity of the closed
type of body, particularly the sedan, is in-
deed one of the factors that made the capital
increase desirable. And the end has not
come yet; for a good deal of construction
work is still in progress and further plant
additions are inevitable. The works—at
Woodville and Adelaide —are two vast col-
lections of power-driven machines, many of
them quite small, for cheaping production,
largely by standardising the product and
simplifying the job of assembling the parts ;
and the improvement of these machines is
constantly sought. If the time comes when
no new plant is going in, Holden’s manage-
ment will certainly think that something is
wrong somewhere. This policy must involve
a good deal of scrapping; and what the
Wild Cat doesn’t know is the amount of
gross profit written off against that each
year. Factory organisation is first class ; and
the co.’s relations with its workers are
admirable.
The co. has, of course, been greatly helped
by the Customs tariff and the remarkable
arrivals of motor chassis during the last
couple of years. The protection gained from
the tariff will stand, but it is doubtful
whether the same can be said of motor im-
ports. Though it is a long time being reached
there must be a saturation point somewhere,
and the natural prosperity of the last year
or two plus the artificial prosperity from
excessive loan expenditure cannot be trusted
to continue —in fact, the artificial prosperity
certainly cannot continue. Holden’s enter-
prise has fine foundations. But if bad times
hit the Commonwealth, then the diminished
volume of business offering would affect this
co., although less than others because of its
superior equipment and organisation, be-
cause it operates over four States, and be-
cause it handles tramcar construction, etc.
Nevertheless a big plant needs to work at
full capacity to win good returns; lessened
business oftentimes sees overhead continue
almost unaltered. Those are the grey
patches. Comfort can be got from the fact
that in the past three years the excellent
divs. that have been paid have called for only
about 39 p.c. of the net profits; and there
is reason to believe that wear and tear and
obsolescence of plant has been provided for.
Prefs. call for £16,000 p.a. (the co. has the
right to issue another £100,000) and 15 p.c.
on the full issue of ordinaries (now
£468,000) would eat up £70,200; together
£86,200. It is a lot of money; but the small-
est pi’olit of the last three years was more
than that, and in part of that year the co.
had £BOO,OOO less working for it (capital
and reserves) than it has to-day—or will
have when the latest capital issue is fully
paid. Prefs. are well secured as to both
capital and divs. When the latest issue of
capital is all in, security for each pref. share
will be well up towards £s—most of it in
plant, stock, etc., it is true. Goodwill and
pref. share expenses were written out of the
accounts in 1924, and of last year’s profits
£30.000 was taken to write off the item
“contracts.” It was not counted an asset in
the introductory "table, and so the movement
is not shown.

Of the world’s estimated wool clip of 2836
million pounds for 1924 Australia produced,
in round figures, 650 million pounds and
Maoriland 188 millions, together 30 p.c. of
the total. This with a population that could
be massed almost within the boundaries of
London. More than the bare figures tell is
the quality of the wool; and that lifts the
30 p.c. to 70 p.c. in world importance. In
view of these things Australia ought to be
a very great manufacturer of woollen goods
for the world’s market. Unfortunately owing
to our ineffective tariff we don’t supply any-
thing like all of even our own requirements.
Still, there has been a vast improvement
during the past few years, largely owing to
the activities of those patriotic bodies which
are preaching preference for Australian
goods; and such cos. as the A.K.M. and its
subsidiary, Yarra Falls. Ltd., have been able
to successfully put on the market many lines
which until latelv were imported. Never-
theless the last two years of this co. have
been hard travelling chiefly owing to the big
fire which in January, 1924, destroyed the
underwear section of the plant. The 1924
profit does not suggest a poor year, but that
was because of a windfall of £44,590 bonus
scrip from Yarra Falls which was there
credited as profit. And so far as the past
year is concerned the fact that the co. was
insured under a loss of profits policy took
the sting out of the disaster. Here is how
profits for last year were arrived at: —
Gross profit and interest .. ..£29,206
Less expenses .. .. .. 16,918
Net profit from knitting . . . . £12,288
Yarra Falls divs. .. .. .. 27.550
Profits as per table .. ..£39,838
The div. had to be dropped a couple of
points, the third step down since 1920. As
the Board explained to shareholders, a larger
loss resulted than was at first anticipated;
and later, when new buildings were erected
to replace the destroyed portion, it became
evident that improvements in structure and
plant, although expensive, would be advan-
tageous in reducing production costs. An
increase in capital was necessary, and 50.000
£1 ords. were issued at par to shareholders
in April last. That expenditure should im-
prove results from the current term’s opera-
tions. The competition which cut last year’s
profits will still be present, but the slightly
increased Protection lately granted will not
be without value.
Australian Knitting Mills’ holding in
Yarra Falls is 318,500 shares, and that con-
cern is solid-based. Last year the subsidiary
returned a record profit:—

And now the directors report contracts for
60 locos, for the Queensland Government,
which insures a continuance of the activity
that has won 10 p.c. divs. for the past four
years. Back in 1007 and thereabouts in the
old foundry (the co. is over 40, and the
foundry is about 20 years older than that)
there was a grey spell, but the divs. soon
moved to 10 p.c. and the fall to 7 p.c. in
1916 was softened by capitalisations which
made it worth more than 11 p.c. The last
four 10 p.c. divs. have been sweet to those
who have held on from pre-war days. The
past year’s profit was satisfactory; you
mustn’t take much notice of the overshadow-
ing figures of 1923 and 1922, because they
were inflated by additions to reserves, pro-
bably adjustments over shipbuilding con-
tracts cancelled by the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment. Profits were shown after the cus-
tomary £2750 had been provided for depre-
ciation (shown as written off). Reserves of
the introductory table consist of the div.
equalisation, insurance, and general funds.
Additional accmulations are plant replace-
ment (£20,000) suspense account (£10,000)
and the depreciation account (£45,000) ; and
portion of those may be true profits: the
depreciation reserve on June 30 was equal
to 55 p.c. of fixed assets, and that certainly
suggests unnecessary liberality. As against
all those cheerful features has to be set the
fact that Walkers is in a Labor-governed
State; and while that results in a measure
of preference to the local industrialist, it also
burdens him with the shorter working week
and higher wage costs; so the investment
market is not enthusiastic. The balance-
sheet figures are, however, so good that they
atone for a lot

And the position may be even better than
that. Thus though liabilities increased by
£36,939, included in the item is provision for
contingencies of unknown dimensions. The
“investments,” which stand at over £lOO,OOO
(the co.’s paid capital is only £124,193), are
understood to be chiefly bank shares and war
loans: and the auditors certify them to be
in the books at less than current market
values. The liquid position has moved like
this: —

Liabilities .. 58,350 48,554 85,493

each £1 of capital, and the book value of
fixed assets ((css depreciation account) a
further 6s.

Although the div. was dropped half a point
it ate up practically all the net profit. The
trouble appears to lie chiefly in the keener
competition ; and added to that is the recent
heavy buying of freeholds. As years flow
on these purchases may show good results ;
but it is hard to make capital newly invested
in such assets show even 74 p.c. net. That
the co. held its business was evident from
the gross profit:—

1924 .. .. 101,598 87,321
1925 .. 109,537 96,985
What is very clear is that the new moves
have not brought immediate improvement
in the matter of expenses. The increase of
£9004 over 1924 is by no means comforting,
especially as 1924 carried the expenditure
and dislocation of business inseparable from
the big reconstruction at headquarters. It
looks as if somebody might cast an eye on
the organisation of the business and the
various departments with benefit to share-
holders. Not that the 74 p.c. is a poor re-
turn to older shareholders —almost a quarter
of the paid capital represents reserves capi-
talised since 1916 —but the proportion of in-
come eaten by expenditure is heavy and the
tendency will have to be hit with a mid-iron
if the directors want to preserve even the
74 p.c.
Balance-sheet figures have moved as fol-
lows :

The liabilities include £60,989 borrowed on
mortgage. Stocks are in at a slightly lesser
figure; and with keen competition ruling a
careful eye has presumably been cast over the
stock lists. “Fixtures, fittings, plant and motor
vehicles, £24,588,” is a substantial figure, but
the Board has always written off with what
appears to be liberality. The finances are
easy enough: floating debts at April 30 of
£73,632 were represented by liquid and semi-
liquid assets aggregating £157,035.

This co. is uncle to a tremendous number of
people. Capital is quarter of a million, re-
serves total £46,441, and bank overdraft and
other outside debt amount to £67,428; the
latter includes provision for taxation. The
Mont de Piete must be a reasonable relative,
because there has never been anything
greater than 124 p.c. in it for Shareholders
in its 40-odd years of existence —round about
1900 there were a few terms at 74 p.c.—
and while new shares were several times
issued at premiums only once were any
sweets handed out —a small gift issue in
1920. On the other hand, the return has been
consistent, with 124 p.c. more often than 10
p.c., and the co. is so well based that share-
holders have no reason to be dissatisfied with
the management. Although the co. is not
working wholly on its own money, the
outside debt represents only a few weeks’ re-
payment of advances. The latter expanded

Ten years ago paid capital was £112,500, and
£149 515 was in advances on mortgages,
pledges and other securities; there has been
an increase of more than 1-0 p.c. in the
period. Those pledges, mortgages, etc., re-
present all the capital and reserves and much
of the outside money. They returned m
interest last year £60,414— equal to 28 p.c.,
of which exes, absorbed £29,358, leaving the
net profit shown in the introductory table.
The value of those securities has to be taken
for granted, but there has been no over-
valuation in the past, and the careful man-
agement should by now have become fixed.
The Commonwealth 51 p.c. War Conver-
sion and Redemption Loan is going off well
enough, but hesitating holders can do no
better than make up their minds to convert
at once. The return is very good and a cash
bonus at the rate of 1 p.c. p.a. from the
date of the application to December 15 is an
inducement not to be picked up every day.
There is a patriotic side to the matter, too,
of course. Just at present those who are
not on the Labor side of the fence are protest-
ing their patriotism with more than ordinary
fervor. Well, here is a challenge to some of
them to show what that fervor is made of.

Hotel Adelaide is to be the simple title
of that city’s big new caravanserai, on the
site of two old North-terraco residences next
to the Adelaide Club. It expects to acquire
the suspended license of the late Grand Cen-
tral. It will be run by a co. which is asking
the public for a quarter of a million —
£65,000 in 8 p.c. preferential shares, the
rest ordinary. Profits are estimated at
£21,000 a year. Cost of building and equip-
ping are placed at £184,000; nine storeys
■—“the most modern hotel in the southern
hemisphere.” Thomas Garlyon, junior, comes
in as manager; he and Lancelot Stirling and
E. H. Bakewell, South Aus. pastoralists, are
the provisional directors. The capital is thus
as good as underwritten.

Broken Hill Prop, is equipping the Potosi
shaft with an up-to-date outfit with the
object of raising ore. The Potosi is about
a mile and a half north of the North mine,
and there is no productive ground in be-
tween, but that does not matter if the ore
is there, as it seems to be. In fact, there
is no doubt of it; but the grade has never
been disclosed so far as the public knows.
The distance from the North workings to
the Potosi is only half that from the North
to the South —in the opposite direction. Any-
how, if the Potosi is really a mine on the
lode extension another generation must be
added to the visible life of Broken Hill, as
it would imply many other probabilities, if
not certainties. The Prop, is also erecting
a new mill to retreat slime residues from
its own and other companies’ mills. The
cost of the salt required in the process has
been a lion in the path for a long time, but
now it is said that the quantity necessary
has been reduced to about one-sixth of what
was once called for. Likewise there are
rumors of the metal from the dumps being
recovered in the form of bullion in one con-
tinuous process. There is life in the old
dog yet. More men are drawing wages
from the Prop, even now than from any
other mine on the lode. The balance-sheet
does not tell how much of the dividend money
comes from the mine; but if those who ought
to know do know r , the “Big Mine” made as
much last year as the South- —something well
over the half-million.

Melbourne people who tell things say that
Gall, superintendent of the North Broken
Hill mine, is going to Melbourne, and that
Cyril Emery, at present managing the Brit-
ish section of the amalgamated North-
British, is to have charge of the lot. If
so, George Weir may be thinking of taking
things a bit easier. He has been a great
worker and warrior for the North, and Gall
is another of the same sort.

If the Junction North had an engine at
the Pinnacles that did not want so much
doctoring there w r ould soon be a different
weekly statement of receipts and expendi-
ture. There is a fair supply of good ore in
the mine, but you can’t get a profit out of
it unless your engine will go all the time.
Big-brother B. 11. Prop, helps a lot with
the repairs, but Diesel would turn in his
grave if he heard the curses thrown at his

Cecil Ryan, of the Pioneer, has cried wolf
so often about that show, and divs. have
flowed on, that people have lost sight of the
fact that it has only been the lift in the
price of tin which has kept the show profit-
earning. Long ago Ryan defined the good
drift from the indifferent. The plot he
labelled payable has disappeared. Of the
“possible payable” only a patch remains to
the south. There are two things to do. One
is to find out if by working down the gutter
to the west the lead by any streak of luck
improves in tin contents. This job can be
done by a series of close bores. As Ryan
is an artist at such work, his results will
be accepted as defining to a nicety whether
ground ahead is of payable grade. No. 2
possibility is that, even with a lower tin
content, the metal market will hold so as
to convert even poor wash into pay-dirt. It
really looks as if the Pioneer is at about its
last kick this time. The gutter hasn’t
yielded badly since the co. left the late
Alfred Mellor’s office. Then it looked to be
a gone coon. Ryan’s boring induced Gibbs,
Bright and Sep Miller to go ahead. See
what it has done in the last two years, and
then look back on the co.’s career: —
Drift. Cost. Oxide won
Year to c. yds. c. yd. Tons.
June 30, 1924.. 447,300 8.806 d. 233 J
June 30, 1925.. 504,500 10.471 d. 3091
1900-25 .. 12,336,900 6.522 d. 8441 J
Pioneer plus Argo-
naut and S.
Pioneer .. 13,804,700 6.571 d. 8985
If tin be taken at £l5O a ton the gross value
of oxide from the Pioneer, accepting it as
70 per cent, tin, runs into many millions. Of
course a big swag has to be deducted for
expenses, but what a little treasure to pick
up from a practical discard! In the face
at the Pioneer the drift during the year
dropped from 1.3731 b. oxide to 1.1711 b. At
St. Helens the Argonaut plant worked on
1.271 b. wash, but it was tough and shallow,
so costs went from lOld. to llld. Terrace
ground there is nearly all cleaned up, so
that the next shift of the pipe line will be
to the southern portion of the creek flats.
The co. paid 2s. 3d. a share in divs. last
year; and if tin goes much higher Ryan’s
pessimism over results for this year may
again be misplaced.

Golden Horseshoe (W.A.), with over
£12,000,000 production to its credit, reports
27ft. of 89s. ore in the East lode crosscut at
2630 ft. This is the most cheering find made
on the Kalgoorlie-Boulder field for some time
and should, if of any extent, be a valuable
sweetener to the mine’s mostly low-grade
reserves. Many tons of gold have already
been won from this lode in the Horseshoe,
and even much greater wealth has been ex-
tracted from it in the adjoining Ivanhoe
lease; in fact, until broken up at depth by a
porphyry bar it was the Ivanhoe’s backbone.
Greenbushes (W.A.) is to be livened up
again. A small local co. is being formed to
re-open some of the old shows and the Gov-
ernment is expected to help. To date the
field has produced about a million pounds’
worth of tin, but very little of it in the
past few years. Some time ago when opera-
tions were at a standstill the Government
averted disaster to the settlement by provid-
ing timber-hewing and sleeper-cutting jobs for
most of the idle miners. Now, owing to the
shipping strike, this work has almost ceased.
* * * *
Mutooroo (W.A.), with £12,000 in hand, is
still looking for a mine. Many, mostly in
the West, have been looked at during the
past year, but none has been considered
good enough to option. Others are now being
investigated. The trouble is to find a decent
show big enough. Quite a lot are promising,
but too small for a co.
* * * *
To help in the hunt for calls Emu Co.
(W.A.) has issued an optimistic circular re-
garding its prospects. The co. controls a
number of Wiluna leases outside those held
by Collier’s London syndicate, and in view
of the latter’s success claims to have a rea-
sonable chance of striking something good.
Several other Adelaide cos. shepherding
blocks on the field also fancy their prospects.
* * * *
Expert W. Bestwick, who does more mine
reporting for Adelaide nowadays than any-
one else, has advised the Hansel Mundy
board to give up boring for the Radio lode
on the Radio Deeps (W.A.) and continue
working the one it has. He also recommends
that all ore raised be crushed as soon as bat-
tery treatment is available, which may be
taken as a hint to clean up and consider the
advisableness of getting out.
* ' * * *
Bullfinch (W.A.) has fallen down on its
job at Comet Vale. The co. started off last
year by attempting to pump a sea of brine
out of the derelict Sand Queen and Gladsome
mines without a sharp eye on costs. It nearly
succeeded several times, but owing to want of
capital has been obliged to give up. A Gov-
ernment subsidy backed by an attractive re-
cord of production induced the Bullfinch to
go to Comet Vale, but, as The Bulletin
remarked long ago, the co. would have been
better off had it remained at Bullfinch, where
parties of tributors are still making a living.
* * * *
After spirited bidding a local crowd has
secured an option on Westralia’s latest gold
discovery. The find is in a place of small
scattered reefs about 280 miles north of the
rail head at Meekatharra. Owing to its re-
moteness some time may elapse before any
reliable opinion can be formed of its real
value. Meanwhile the public had better
stand clear unless it wants a sheer gamble.
Tarcoola Blocks, one of the indigent Adel-
aide cos. which recently took options, on lead-
bearing areas at Ajana (W.A.), is recon-
structing. More funds are needed to carry
on and exercise the option “if deemed desir-
able.” With lead at its present price Ajana
is considered to have a chance, and Tar-
coola’s prospects are as good as any.

Ravenswood Gold Mines (Q.) still goes
strong on the rich patch on the Duke Reef.
A crushing of 162 tons cleaned up on Oct. 7
gave 1008 oz. smelted gold; also 51 tons con-
centrates and 1J tons sludge—total value
£5075, or a bit over £3l per ton of stone.
This crushing came from the stopes over No.
5 south level. Now that stoping has com-
menced at No, 6 north and south, with the
old stopes still going strong, there should be
a bigger tonnage of quartz hauled. If the
rich stuff goes down to No. 6 there is a
bright future before the show. A further
50ft. of driving should prove it. The last
50ft. of No. 6 south has been in payable
stone averaging about 60z., and the man-
agement thinks the very high values shown
in No. 5 will be found lower. The deepest
workings on the Duke reef were at the
No. 5 level, which was also the richest, and
No. 6 is only 120 ft. lower, or 404 ft. vertical
depth. A lot of expensive work that is ex-
pected to enhance output has been done re-
cently, and the directors think it should not
be long before the co. enters the div. list.

Sardine Tin, Kangaroo Hills (Q.). is
flushed with hope over developments at Nos.
3 and 4 levels. Chairman Angus McCallum
says: “After creating a reasonable reserve,
dividends will be resumed, probably before
Christmas.” To September 19, 255 f tons of
ore gave 27 tons black tin, worth, say, £4400.
Latest crushings are a fraction better —00
tons for 8 tons Bewt., worth about £l5OO.
Ore equally good is expected when the drive
is extended at No. 1 level.

Randolph Bedford writes: —
“Lead Zinc” (B. 15/10/’25) objects to the state-
ment that Ibus £8 4s. 4d. ore should show a
gross profit of £4 a ton. In attempted disproof he
cites Broken Hill South’s net profit of 375. Id. per
ton of ore, “assuming undervaluation of concentrates
in course of realisation and in stock.” Further
he says that B. H. South would have made a heavy
loss if lead contents had been of “Ibus grade, viz.,
6 per cent, lead” ; but he neglects to compare B. 11.
South’s zinc content of 10.7 p.c. with Ibus s zinc
content of 13.9 per cent., zinc and lead being about
the same price per unit.

Yogel (Papua) Petroleum Co. is being
formed to follow up the oil prospecting
work of Frank L. Dolton on Cape \ ogel
Peninsula, Papua. Capital is £50,000 in
£1 shares; 25,000 are offered to the public.
Dolton, who spent two years and £2ooo on
the work, is to get up to 16,666 paids in the
proportion of one for every two subscribed
by the public, and is to superintend drilling.
The other 8334 shares will be held in re-
serve. The co. is to get a five-years’ conces-
sion over 750 sq. miles in the s.-e. corner ot
New Guinea, which is claimed to lie within
the Pacific oil belt, and where the liquid--
if it is there —is expected to be met within
2000 ft., with a right to a five-years’ exten-
sion. If payable oil is struck the co. will
get a 640-acre lease with the right to a
further area on application. Papua’s recent
geologist, the late E. R. Stanley, suspected
oil in this area in 1923, and regarded the
structure as ideal. The concession was
examined in September last year by H. S.
Lyne, who found “the individual structures
which hold the oil are not of large extent
but there are several of these which would
produce oil in payable quantities, and the
whole make an oilfield of large extent. No
seepages have been met, but shales treated
with chloroform have given traces of oil.
From surface examination alone it is impos-
sible to determine whether oil exists payably
or not; deep boring will be the only real
test, and something like a dozen oil-geolo-
gists (including Dr. Wade) have reported
that the test of this belt is well worth while
The co. is to go to registration when 10,000
shares have been applied for.

Taranaki Oil Fields (M.L.) has increased
its capital from £500,000 to £BOO,OOO. There
are 309,500 shares issued at present and
154,750 of the new lot are being offered to
shareholders, one for two, at par (£1), pay-
able in four instalments. The issue has been
underwritten, and the underwriters get an
option till March 31,1928, to take up one share
at 355. for each two shares underwritten.
The option given the underwriters at the
flotation of the co. over 150,000 shares at
355. has been extended to March 31, 1927.
The fresh capital is needed to carry out
F. G. Clapp’s geological and drilling pro-
gramme on the Gisborne Oil Co.’s property
near Poverty Bay, on the east side of the
'North Island, where seepages and correct
structures are stated to exist. Dr. Clapp has
gone home to New York.

New Guinea Oil Co., operating at the
Vailala River, has had a reshuffle at the
top. Though no longer connected with field
operations, the Hayneses retain their big
share interests. Director R. B. Cameron,
recently returned, says transport has been
impossible since March, owing to the abnor-
mal rainfall causing the corduroy to become
more like a raft than a road. The quagmne
is solidifying again, and the heavy rig and
drill material should be at the bore sit.;
early next month. The purchase of heavy
stuff for transport in such regions was doubt-
ful business. Driller Arthur Moore is head
serang insofar as field operations are con-
cerned. The oil launch built in Sydney
to run from Moresby to the \ ailala River
has had the stopwork craze pretty badly, and
the skipper has reached the end of his re-
serve of cuss words.


UP AGAINST IT!
“Since their series of defeats in the House the Victorian Allan-Peacock Government has pursued a policy of such masterly inactivity that the Upper Chamber has had to close down through lack of legislation.”
GRANDPA: “Come on, you loafers, set busy—we’re short of wood!” THE ALLAN-PEACOCKS: “How can wo. Grandpa? Every time we set it going we get mixed up in the works.”

“X2X”: The transmission of. photographs
by wire is giving' more beneficial results in
America than those derived from the appre-
hension of escaping criminals(B. 15/10/’25).
A month or so back a patient was admitted
to a hospital in one of the Western States
suffering from a complaint which threatened
a speedy fatal ending. The local doctors,

operation to be of any value, took an X-ray
photograph and transmitted it telegraphically
to one of the country’s most famous
clinics, nearly 3000 miles away. There it was
examined, after which an opinion was sent
back by wire, together with instructions as
to what should be done. The instructions
were followed, with the result that the pati-
ent made a good recovery. From the time
the photograph was taken until the wire
came back less than three hours elapsed.

“Oxmead”: The Jap became a fairly fre-
quent circumstance on the W'.A. goldfields
soon after the mid-’nineties, although his
activities were confined to running laundries
and promoting establishments of a less repu-
table kind for his womenfolk, but I only once
heard of a Chinaman penetrating as far.
John wasn’t wanted there, and he knew it.
The lone exception arrived at Gullewa, near
Yalgoo, about the close of a warm summer
day, consigned to the order of the local pub-
lican, who complained that he could never
get a European cook whose sobriety was
proof against climatic influences and. the
bibulous habits of the period. The- miners
had a roll-up instantly and took peremptory
but not harsh measures—at least they didn t
account them unnecessarily harsh to lay the
yellow peril. They escorted the bewildered
and trembling Mongolian to a large tree—-
Gullewa was better timbered than most fields,
being much nearer the coast —and attached a
rope to a stretching branch. The other end
of the rope was knotted in workmanlike
fashion by Sailor Jack around the unwanted
new-comer’s neck. Then it was. un-knotted
again, and a score of hands pointed mean-
ingly to the seaward track. The heathen
look the hint and his departure simultane-
ously. the latter at a good swinging trot,
and it was always asserted that he covered
the hundred miles or so to Gerald ton in a
couple of days. The incident was spoken
of for years afterwards as a highly successful
effort in moral suasion.
“X.R.N.” : I know one other place where
the Union jack is never, hauled down (B.
S/'lO/’25). That is the British cemetery on
the island of Lissa, on the eastern shore of
the Adriatic. Periodically a man-of-war from
Malta visits Lissa to see that all is in order
in our Campo Santo. She substitutes a new
flag for the old one. but even that one is
‘•broken” at the head of the flagstaff before
the old one is hauled, down. Admirals’ flags
and Commodores’ pennants are never hauled
down ; but smaller ones are substituted for
the day size at sunset. Neither is the pen-
nant flown by every “private” ship (i.e., a
ship not a flagship) in commission ever
hauled down. This pennant is the direct
descendant of the whip with which Blake
said he rode and ruled the sea in reply to
Van Tromp’s famous remark about the
broom.
“Sixenate”: De Garis hasn’t the business
of juggling hundreds to make them look like
thousands all to himself. Another young man
of affable and expensive habits made a can-
did explanation about his cheque transae-
cions the other day.
He started, he ex-
plained, by getting
a friend to cash a
cheque for a ten-
ner, which he met
with the money he
obtained when he
cashed another
cheque with an-
other friend for a
larger amount. The
first friend, having
had his other
cheque duly met.
made no bones
about cashing a
larger one still,
with which the
second man’s was
duly honored; and
thereafter the de-
bonair youth w'ent
on with the juggle.
The bank manager
was so impressed
by the amount of
money that poured
in and out of the
account that he
allowed an over-
draft; but the
young man’s ex-
pensive habits were
a drain upon his
fictitious fortunes,
so he prepared for
escape by having
a final orgy of
cheque- passing.
Why he didn’t get
away is not clear;

period of hard woi;k
ahead of a hectic
young man who,
on absolutely no-
thing, succeeded in
showing by his
bank passbook that he was handling thou-

“Forebridge" : Strange things may happen
in dockyards as well as at sea. Just be-
fore H.M.A.S. Adelaide —the last man-o’-war
built at Cockatoo Dockyard—was due to
begin her commissioning trials, her navigat-
ing officer discovered that the vessel had not
been provided with a steering compass.
Hasty inquiries elicited that this somewhat
essential bit of nautical furniture had been
overlooked. What was worse, the requisite
space had not been left on the bridge to fit
the instrument. A bevy of high officials
descended on the ship, and sought desper-
ately to find a suitable place for the binnacle
and" compass. The steering-wheel was in
HIS BRAND.
“You so remind me of champagne."
"What, spariding, eh ?"
“No, extra dry!”
position, but as it was jambed hard up
against the forward bulkhead of the bridge,
there was no room to put the compass in
front of it. Finally it was decided to cut
away a portion of the bridge front, and
build a small structure in front of the wheel,
jutting out from the bridge itself, in which
the binnacle could be placed. The strange
projection, like an inverted coffin, still adorns
the Adelaide’s lower bridge.

“Miro”: Reference in The Bulletin to
the tune played by Sydney G.P.O. chimes
recalls that the chimes of the Public Library
at Auckland play the same air. Just over
the road is the big normal school, and it was
the custom for the children at each hour to
sing the words:—
Lord, through this hour
Be Thou our guide ;
Kept by Thy power,
No foot shall slide.
One day a distinguished visitor was going
through the school, and, much interested in
the little ceremony, asked a small boy to
supply the words the class had just sung.
He was speechless for quite a while after-
wards when seven-and-a-half recited glibly:
I must - not leave
My girl alone;
She is so drunk
She can’t get home.

“Wang”: That old-time Mecca of the
bushy down for a holiday in Melbourne, the
Eastern Markets, is that sort of Mecca
no more. Where shooting galleries, the try-
your-strength and weighing machines, ice-
cream parlors and lolly stalls once were is
now a garage where the affluent theatregoer
may stall his. car, and many a man now
middle-aged and prosperous, as he parks his
limousine, can hear a raucous voice shouting,
“’Ere y’are, hit ’em while they’re swingin',”
or in fancy see the charmer who presided at
the ice-dream or hot-pea stall. The “pit-
chers” have outed the old place as a pro-
vider of entertainment for the younger gener-
ation, but in the hearts of an older genera-
tion there is still a warm spot for it.

“Tabac”: Mr. and Mrs. A were having a
good time in a hotel, and thought they’d
ask their old friends Mrs. and Miss B to
dine with them. The ladies duly arrived
well clad against the English climate. They
asked to be shown to the cloak-room and
were taken to an apartment used for that
purpose and there Ma left her fur-coat.
Having dined, she went to get her garment.
It was gone—stolen ! Being a resolute lady
she put the matter in the hands of her
lawyer, and it came to court. Now one
of those delightful points that tickle the
legal palates of the Junior Bar arose. Was
she or was she not a guest of the hotel-
keeper? By a guest of an innkeeper is
meant one on whose goods in the inn the
keeper has a lien at law, such lien being
his protection against impecunious or dis-
honest guests. If this lady was his guest
then he became responsible for the safe
keeping of her fur-coat. O/E course the
hotelkeeper protested that Mrs. and Miss B
were not his guests'; they were the guests
of Mr. and Mrs. A. But Grear, J., said
that the responsibility of an innkeeper for
the safety of a traveller’s property begins at
the moment that the relationship of guest
and host- —in the innkeeping sense —arises,
and that relationship springs up as soon as
the traveller enters the inn with the inten
tion of using it asi an inn and is so received
by the innkeeper-host. It does not matter
that no food or lodging has been supplied or
found up to the time of the loss. It is
sufficient if the circumstances show an in-
tention on the one hand to provide, and on
the other hand to accept, such accommo-
dation. The liability of the traveller’s goods
to a lien then arises, and the innkeeper on
his part becomes responsible for the safe-
keeping of his guest’s goods. So Mrs. B
got the price of a new fur-coat and the inn-
keeper learnt wisdom at a price.
“Kriz”: A novel wedding as far as the
nor’-west of Australia is concerned took
place on board the W.A. State steamer Bam-
bra a week or so back. The parties hailed
from Onslow, where there is no church. The
steamer was berthed alongside the new jetty
at Beadon, a few miles from Onslow, and, a
parson being handy, the knot was tied in the
saloon. This is the first marriage recorded
on the Barabra and possibly the first ’board-
ship one on the nor’-west coast.
“Bris” : A Brisbane Digger has discovered
a way to make Repat. sit up and take notice:
it is simply to heave a brick through the
Deputy-Commissioner’s window. The ex-
soldier had been vainly petitioning for an
increase of pension till he adopted this form
of direct action, after which things liaii-
pened quickly. He was placed on full pen-
sion—a rise from 12s. fid. to 12 2s. a week-
given a trip to Toowoomba to steady hm
nerves, and later on a trip to Sydney. Cer-
tainly he was also charged with window-
smashing, but the magistrate seemed to think
there were excuses, and placed him back m
Repat’s care with the suggestion that the
Department should treat him better.

“8.1-1. N.” : Some children strayed t from
the. “Pugtown” schoolyard (Inman Valley.
S.A. —a district as famous for oranges as
Renmark or Salisbury), and one Biddle,
aged 8, was missed. The lads searched and
found that the little chap had fallen into a
6ft. hole in the river, where his body could
be seen at the bottom, face downwards.
Philip O’Reilly, aged 13, although unable
to swim, hopped in, clothes and all, and
managed to grab and raise the younger boy
and bring him ashore. The kids, being good
Australians and resourceful, successfully
employed Schafer’s method of resuscitation.
No report was made to the schoolmistress,
but the tale leaked out. O’Reilly, taxed with
his share of the affair, said: “Yep, twuz
u close go ; lie m-m-might ha bin drown dud.
It was all in the day’s work to him.
“Quambi” : Nobody can be quite as precise
as a conscientious youngster. It was Doris
Jones, aged 7, of a Brisbane suburb,
who answered a knock on the front door
of the Jones mansion, to be asked by a
caller “Is this Mrs. Jones’s house?” After
turning the matter over for a few moments,
she answered in perfect sincerity. “I m not
sure. I don’t think Mummy’s quite paid
for it yet.”

SYMPTOMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One day with dumb wonder, with wit split asunder.
In terror that made all niv vertebrae squirm,
I heard a bookmaker (whose offers to take a
barge shade of short odds on a favorite firm
tnmoved left the crowd) in a voice very loud in
Dicate a desire to be nothing but fair,
And clamor, quite clearly, a price that was nearly
An honest one —loudly I shrieked in despair.
And then, horror rising, I heard a surprising
Political speech that was calm and polite;
And fright quickly lathered my brow as I gathered
That here was a statesman —a gentleman quite,
And one who ne’er trembled, nor lied nor dissembled,
In fear for the votes that his candor might lose;
More dear to his heart he held country than party.
And—all of a dither 1 bellowed for booze.
But panic pursued me; the fear that imbued me
Could not in an ocean of whisky be drowned,
When, living and teaching the Christ of his preach-
ing,
A parson who loved all His peoples I found;
Who saw no attraction in sect or in faction,
But said, “Every man is God’s son, I surmise.
l\ry creed or another, what matters, my brother ?” —
Oh, long then and wildly I wailed to the skies.
But hope had not left me, of courage bereft me,
If this were the worst —if I hadn’t then seen
A paid agitator, who counted it greater
To work for a glory, not what he could glean ;
Who said, “You are starving. This strike T am
halving
The guerdon you give me; to do it I'm glad.
I'll live on a.' ration in seaman-like fashion.”
And then-—why, of course, then I knew I was mad !

“R.D.” : Now that the Brisbane statue of
T. J. Ryan has been unveiled, some of the
late Chief Justice Griffith's admirers are
asking why his memory shouldn’t be em-
balmed in bronze, too. There is no reason,
of course, except that the money hasn’t been
shelled out. It is absurd to talk as if these
things are regulated by some spirit of
poetic justice that works without human
prompting. For the last 25 years or more a
statue at Petrie’s Bight has preserved the
form and features of T. J. Byrnes, a bright
politician who was cut off in his youth; but
there has been no movement to erect one to
Mcllwraith, a much greater man in every
way. It was merely that the early death of
Byrnes aroused public sentiment. Generally
speaking, our towns have done little to give
a historic atmosphere to their streets by
erecting memorials to their great men. Mel-
bourne has a nondescript assortment of eques-

trian statues of kings and generals, but ■where
is there any sign of Higinbotham’s presence ?
The late Web Gilbert cfould have done a
bronze of “Greek-browed Higinbotham ? that
would have had artistic as well as atmo-
spheric value, but the usiial civic idea of a
statue is something royal or military on a
horse to fill up a vacant space. Like the
china dogs on the old sidejooard.

“Caractacus”: Now that the Universities
are turning out young doctors by the hundred
and the B.M.A. is stricter than ever against
the infamous practice of advertising, the
budding medico is hard put to it to find a
place on the map. Hence the enterprise ot
two meds. fresh from the “shop,” licensed
as practitioners only the day before; in-
securing for themselves the job' of examining
an indigent accused of murder, was really
inspiring. (One, be it noted, bore a name
common among the Chosen —never a dila-
tory race.) Their just-fledged opinion was
pitted against that of a mental specialist
who had grown grey in. specialty, but that
only rendered more intense the fierce lime-
light of a Court which beat upon the. young
venturers. As competition grows in the
profession, free-pnblicity methods will have
to grow in vigor and nous. The old Bob
Sawyer touch —being summoned from church
—is' obsolete, now that churches are feo
sparsely attended, and hastening to a motor
accident is not likely to gain the press
mention it did before motor-smashes became
as much an accompaniment of week-ends as
races and cricket matches. The day. may yet
come when the struggling med. will secure
“arrangements” with pushes, football cliques,
soviets, I.W.W. lodges and others in control
of potential casualty lists; “retainers” from
police patrols, perpetrators of crimes pas-
sionels, umpire bodyguards and the like; and
the right to honorary attendance on popular
figures like Tom Walsh or Gladys Mbncrieft.

“Aus. Div.”: The Navy may reckon mid-
night as 00.00 (B. 8/10/’25), but in the
A.I.F we were not supposed to recognise the
witching hour at all Any operation or
occurrence at that precise moment had to

“Coot”: In a Melbourne suburban kirk
the meenister lately received a call from
another congregation, and accepted it. I end-
ing his successor’s induction it was necessary
to arrange for preachers, who, of course,
would have to be paid. Thereupon an
elder suggested that, as one of his colleagues
lived next door to the kirk, his wire-
less set might be connected and a loud
speaker installed, thus enabling the COT J'
gregation to listen-in to the services broad-
casted from Melbourne churches morning
and evening, and so save the expense of a
“supply.” * *
“Runa”: “Wiremu’s” tale of the, spirit
ship (B. 24/9/’25) recalls the stories the
Rotorua Maoris tell of the great phantom
canoe that sailed Lake Tarawera before the
eruption of ISSG. It was in the twilight
this canoe, 70ft. long, glided across the lake,
with its rowers, each with a dog s head,
bending silently to the paddles. To hear
old Sophia, the famous guide, who declared
she had been a spectator of awesome
scene, tell of her experience was to almost
see the spectral thing. The old waliine knew
that the ghost canoe was a warning ot
impending calamity for her people, and when
the side of Tarawera blew out a few days
later and the upheaval devastated the Maori
village of Wairoa, she asserted it was the
vengeance of the atua of the mountain be-
cause some Maoris had taken wild honey
from trees on the tapu ground.

“Henry Pannikin”: When we were in
camp in 1915 at Frazer’s Paddock, Brisbane,
it was a hard job
to get more than
one pass to town a
week. Scores of
men consequently
ignored the form-
ality, but anyone
caught on the re-
turn journey lost
a bit of his pay. A
roundabout way,
unguarded, was
presently discover-
ed ; it involved
crossing a swamp
by sliding along a
water pipe about
200 ft. long. Twenty
of us were astride
of this one night
and slipping home-
ward at a big bat
when the procession
was suddenly halted
and word passed
back that a carpet-
snake, had taken
possession of our
bridge. A rapid re-
treat followed, and,
the night being
dark and no one game enough to lead the way
back, armed, we all were up before the
Commandant in the morning.

so severely from shock that he did not board
a train. ’ Then he ventured on one again,
and was involved in the smash at Opapa.
He declares that as he felt the engine lurch
at Opapa a sudden and terrible picture ot
the Ongarue disaster flashed before his eyes
as if thrown on a screen.

“Sigs" : Belfast Smith, the little man who
looks after the fossils in Brisbane Museum,
keen political student, Shavian devotee and
intimate of most northern politicians, is
one character in this story, and Brorson
Hanson, vagabond artist, is the other.
Hanson, who is an experienced road-traveller,
lured Smith, then a raw pommy, away to a
mountain tour, which lost its glamor in a
three-day fast and empty pockets. With
their stomachs swearing their throats were
cut Hanson did a small water-color of a
prosperous-looking farmhouse down the spur
a bit, and after a lot of persuasion and some
bounce sent Smith to exchange it for food.

stupid with disappointment. “M ell,” he
asked, “what did you get?” Smith's reply
was just audible. “Empty!” he said, and
subsided in a heap on the bracken ferns.

“Pink Tape” : The dangers of attempting
to ensnare the affections of a married man
who declines to be a gay Lothario were re-
vealed to a Melbourne court the other day
in an action for damages for assault. The
plaintiff, who came fresh from hospital bear-
ing evidences of some particularly despiteful
treatment, had been the guest of a married
pair. She said that the assault was unpro-
voked, but the mail’s version was that, while
his missus, in a spirit of hospitality, had
gone out to buy soft drinks, the . guest
approached him in much the same spirit as
Mrs. Potiphar showed toward Joseph and
found him equally unobliging. Not only that,
but when his wife returned he told her all
about it, putting it that the lady had in-
sulted him. Whereupon the wife, although
only a scrap of a woman, “went for” the per-
fidious female, and made her eligible for
admission to hospital. The plaintiff alleged
that the husband joined in the assault, but
“alone I did it” w’as the wife’s attitude, and
the husband was acquitted. He has to pay.
however, for his wife was fined £20 —quite
a heavy indirect penalty for being Joseph.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp”: The “view mat.” ad.
got a bad advertisement in a recent Brisbane
shooting case. A serious-minded young man
advertised for a partner, and as a result
corresponded with a young woman, who sub-
sequently married someone else. Thereupon
he followed the lady to the Queensland
capital and fired some bullets at her husband
and himself, mainly to the detriment of him-
self. The habit of taking seriously the gang-
ing agley of matrimonial hopes that have
arisen out of newspaper advertisements had.
another exemplification in Melbourne quite
recently. In this case the girl who
responded to his ad. told the would-be. swain
at the first meeting that he didn’t suit; but
the swain insisted that, she having, as it
were, put in a tender for his affections, he
was entitled to hold her to it. He draped
himself around her place of business, com-
pelling her to use side exits; and when the
young lady came home at night she frequently
found him hanging about the street or even
sitting on her domestic doorstep. The last
time he was fined for annoying the girl was
the third, and the Bench solemnly warned
him that, unless he desisted, the little brown
jug was in store for him.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: Williamstown (Melb.) lias
been seething with indignation over a police-
court case in which a father and stepmother,
with obvious Murdstone convictions on the
value of floggings in the upbringing of the
young, were charged with cruelty to children.
What inflamed public feeling still more was
the discovery that the woman held strong
religious views and was a teacher for a well-
known sect; the wallopings of the hapless
infants were seemingly inflicted from a stern
sense of duty. In what witnesses described
as a cleanj comfortable home, atrocious
cruelty appears to have prevailed, until the
police pounced and took the unfortunate
children away. Local interest packed the
court when the case came on for hearing,
angry women “listened in” through the win-
dows, and attempts at “demonstrations" had
to be suppressed. The demonstrators, how-
ever, let themselves go outside, when, after
the case against the father had been dis-
missed and the mother had been heavily fined,
the bright pair drove away in a motor-car.

“Jim Carew": Any dad who was on the
Cloncurry (Q.) diggings in the ’seventies
can tell of an incident which came perilously
close to ending in a lynching. A Californian
digger was more than suspected of gold-
stealing; but to give him the benefit of any
doubt that might exist, 12 jurors were sel-
ected (he chose six and the accuser six) and
the evidence was placed before them. Lhe
jury found him guilty. A section wanted to
hang him, but milder counsels prevailed and

it was finally decided that deportation would
meet the case. To convince the thief that
they really desired him to leave the diggings,
a guard armed with stockwhips chased him
several miles on his way to Normanton.

“Is psycho-analysis ‘bunk’ ?” —lied Page, 1119/ 25.
There are queries to which you may press
For answers from friend or from foe
And never elicit a Yes
Outright or a positive No.
I hear it wherever I go
Since the line in my consciousness sunk;
All Nature seems whispering low:
Is psycho-analysis bunk ?
Will flappers’ exiguous dress
Still briefer and skimpier grow?
Will Teddy acquire a princess
Before lie is forty or so?
Will Walsh and Johanson and Co.
Go out on their ears with a plunk?
And who can convincingly show
Is psycho-analysis bunk?
The Doyles and the Lodges profess
To talk with the spirits. Heigh-ho!
Ts there proof that the future will stress
For the faith that keeps Conan aglow ?
Is there life with its joy and its woe
In Mars’ inaccessible chunk
Of land with its lashings of snow?—
Is psycho-analysis bunk?

If we sprang from the ape and the skunk.

Harold Maxwell Lefroy, professor of ento-
mology at South Kensington, dead at 48 in
the midst of a scientific experiment, was one
of the biggest men in his line. He came to
Australia during the war to show us what
to do with the weevil in wheat, and made a
few striking and entirely private remarks
about the conduct of affairs here which
showed that he was no friend of blundering
officialdom. His previous war experience
was in dealing with tropical diseases and
their causes in Mesopotamia. His own
story—also strictly private—of his entrance on
his campaign marked him as a man of affairs.
The call to Mesopotamia came while he was
doing Government work in India. Knowing
the methods of both the War Office and the
Indian authorities, he thought it best to get
his commission from his tailor. After dis-
cussion with that artist he decided on a
major’s uniform; and as a major he went to
the Euphrates. There he walked over as
many military obstacles as he found neces-
sary. did his job and returned to India. On
arrival at his starting-point he found a
voluminous correspondence waiting for him,
and discovered that he had just been author-
ised to proceed with the work which he had
completed. Part of the correspondence re-
lated to an argument between the India
and War Offices as to whether he was tc
wear a sword.

When Roland Green beat Massy Greene
for Richmond (N.S.W.) last election the latter
lost not only his seat but also the Prime Minis-
tership, for his claims to the succession were
superior to Bruce’s. Roland Green won largely
on the wounded-hero ticket, although Massy
Greene was rejected three times for the
A.I.P. The latter is now a Senator, but his
brother Bertram is standing for Richmond.
The new candidate worked with Massy to
convert scrub lands on the Richmond into
dairy-farms. Later he similarly pioneered
on the Atherton Tableland, and was there
when war was declared. He immediately
enlisted and served successively in New
Guinea and with the 7th Light Horse at the
Landing. From the Peninsula he was inva-
lided to England, where he transferred to the
Artillery. With the guns he rose to be
Major, winning an M.C. and bar. Military
and administrative ability seems to be bred
in the Greenes, who are grandsons of that
Captain Hobson, R.N., who was the first
Governor of Maoriland and after whom Hob-
son's Bay is named; and they are nephews
of Sir Robert Sandeman—“Siniman Sahib,”
the famous Indian frontier soldier and com-
missioner.

Australia’s reputed oldest inhabitant,
James Wardley, who for decades has had a
place of honor in the Melbourne Eight Hours
procession, reached what is said to be his
110th milestone last week. Wardley, one of
twins, came to Australia in 1852. Forty-one
years ago he resigned the presidency of
the Bakers’ Union, but is still a member.
The injurious effects of night baking are

Richard Beaumont Orchard, the Sydney
watchmaker who was M.H.R. for Nepean
from 1913 till 1919 and Minister of Recruit-
ing in 1918 (and a very good one, too), has
surprised many N.S.W. Nationalists by
nominating for East Sydney when he could
have gone for the easier-looking Reid. Old
John West has held East Sydney since 1910.
though his majorities have never been great;
and the corresponding State electorate re-
turns three Labor members out of five.
Orchard is banking on Darlinghurst, in
which about a third of the electors are en-
rolled, most of them being ladies who live in
flats. Hitherto Darlinghurst has rarely
polled more than 40 p.e.; but Orchard cal-
culates that the compulsory-voting law will
double that percentage at least, and that his
tube-skirt majority in Darlinghurst will ex-
ceed West’s dungaree-pants majority in the
’Loo and Surry 'llls. It is in Orchard's
favor that he looks very like an actor (Dar-
linghurst dotes on actors) and is a capital
entertainer at musical evenings. Still, if Labor
can arrange for a new Sheik picture to be
shown on November 14, West will win.
“Texas Green, M.11.R. for Kalgoorlie,
and Jack Mullany, his Nationalist opponent,
entered the Westralian Assembly together
as goldfield Laborites in 1911. Their poli-
tical paths have diverged since 1916, when
Mullany took the Conscriptionist side of
the argument that rent the party, but they
have remained good friends. In fact, no
one was more indignant than “Texas” when
a journalistic Labor M.L.A., now’ dead, com-
plained that members of the Caucus played
cards with Mullany, instead of sending him
to Coventry. A Victorian, like “Texas,” but
as taciturn as the other is loquacious, Mul-
lany has one distinction unique among latter-
day politicians. He voted for a Redistribu-
tion Bill w’hich wmuld have wiped out his
seat.
A hardy old. salt was Captain Frederick
Mcßetli, who died a few days ago at Dunedin
(M.L.), where he had been marine super-
intendent for the Union Co. Joining the
Union Co. in the ’nineties, his first command
was the Poherua, after which he served as
chief officer in several of the best-knowm
liners and later became skipper of the Tavi-
uni. He settled dowm to a shore job 10 years
ago but ill-health soon drove him out of it.
Michael McNamara, of Vic. Titles Office,
who got the call aloft last week, did a vast
deal as an executive officer of State service
organisations to improve the lot of fellow 7
civil servants. He w r as one of a group that
displayed courage, energy and tact, and
risked unpopularity with Ministers and de-
partmental heads. He w 7 as just on the retir-
ing age (65).
Died at Wellington (M.L.) Charles H.
Izard, M.L.C., aged 63. The son of an
early Wellington settler, Izard wms sent to
Harrow and Lincoln’s Inn, and returned to
M.L. to join his father’s firm of Bell, Gully
and Izard. Later he practised alone and
vfith various partners. An astute business
man and an enthusiast in public affairs,
Izard was a useful member of Parliament,

One of the early exponents of “direct
action” in N.Q. died a few days ago—Jimmy
Foreman, of Townsville. In the old days of
Charters Towers the butchers decided to
raise the price of meat, and the miners didn’t
think it wms a fair deal; So, securing a long
rope, they pulled dowm one butcher's shop as
a protest. For his leading part in this Fore-
man had to stand his trial in Townsville, but
a sympathetic jury acquitted him. He after-
wards took to the wharves and was a steve-
dore until old age drove him to a night-
watchman’s job.

obelisk in Maequarie-place (Sydney) to the
Blue Mountain Inn at Lawson. Sixty pictures
were shown, including one of Captain Bull,
of the 99th Regiment, wdio was Comman-
dant at Bull's Camp, between Woodford and
Linden, and at Blacklieath from 1842 to '47.
Captain Bull was the first gold commissioner
in Victoria in 1852; lie died at Goulburn
aged 95 years. “The Oldest Inhabitant”
served with him when he commanded a
volunteer co. formed to stand up to Russia,
if need be, in the days of the Crimean War.
E. IF. TURNER, Hobart’s Police
Magistrate.
A man to whom sitting in a shire council
has become a habit turned up at the confer-
ence of the Municipal Association of Vic-
toria. Councillor W. Thomas of Whittlesea
has been a member of the local council
since it was established in 1874. His father
kept the Bridge Inn, on the Plenty River,
and, before the council came, Thomas him-
self kept the Yan Yean toll-gate in the
interests of the Road Board. The memories
of the vigorous-looking oldster with the brisk
grey whiskers and the patch over one eye
cover many things, including an encounter
with Ned Kelly.
A. W. Lloyd, not long retired from the
N.S.W. public service—he was chief-sur-
veyor of Public Works —seems to have been
the first official to recommend Canberra as a
suitable site for the Commonwealth capital.
Acting under instructions of Commissioner
Oliver he inspected several proposed sites,
and reported that Canberra was the best
of them.
Exception is taken by Vic. Auditor-Gen-
eral Norris to what lie regards as the undue
generosity of the Railway Commissioners in
giving C. ,T. Harris £5OO a year for 15
months as a retainer after he had been re-
tired _ on a pension of £645 10s. a year.
Harris, wdio is now sec. of the Australian
Club (Melb.), was drawing £lOOO a year as
head of the refreshment-rooms services, and
probably was worth every penny of it. So
doubtful was Norris of the legality of the
payment that he held up the matter till the
Crown Solicitor (Guinness) advised that it
was not contrary to law to retain the ser-
vice of a retired officer in an advisory capa-
city and make him payments which, witli
pension, would exceed the maxium salary
received by him prior to his retirement. He
added a stinging minute, however, that the
case introduced an important precedent—
one that Parliament did not contemplate. It
is all Collins-street to Clapp’s old hat that
there will be no second case of the kind.
The discussion between Adelaide Uni. and
the Federal Government as to whether the
Federal forest should not continue to be the
well-established plantations at Kuitpo, 25
miles south of Adelaide, instead of starting
from nothing at Canberra, has been declared
a drawn game for the present. The school
is to be under Adelaide’s control till Canberra
is ready; the Uni. is to establish a Chair of
Forestry, and calls Norman Jolly to be the
first Professor. Jolly, who is 43, is the
first Rhodes Scholar South Aus. ever had.
He was teaching mathematics at Townsville
before he went to Oxford; after he had
finished his course he joined the forest service
in Burmah, but returned to Australia be-
cause the climate didn’t suit him. Since
then lie has had seven years as Director of
Forests in Queensland and for the last seven
has been a Forests Commissioner in N. S.
Wales.
If family history counted for anything R.
C. Boland, partner in the Rockhampton and
Brisbane legal firm of Rees and Sydney
Jones and Co., should be wearing bunny-
skins. His grandfather, father and brother
have all been Mayor of Toowomba, a three-
generation record believed to be unique
in Australia. But R. C. Boland, a big figure
in the commercial and sporting life of Cen-
tral Queensland, has never shown any desire
to climb into an alderman’s chair. He is
chairman of directors of various cos. and
the owner of a string of thoroughbreds, and
that, he holds, is hobby enough. A sister,
Eugene, went on the English concert-plat-
form some years ago and won the cheers of
the Times wffien she made her debut.
PLUS FOURS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“In the coming season women will wear tweed or
bright-hued velvet ‘plus fours’ for sports. Of all the
masculine modes taken by modern women ‘plus fours’
will doubtless prove the most sightly and sensible,
for they have a fulness which conceals defects.”
-—Loudon Daily Chronicle.
She walks, the lady of my delight,
In knickerbockers wide;
She treads the floors in full “plus fours”
Of tweed, or velvet dyed.
Though whence arose this term for clothes
I never could decide.
She stands—chic minx ! —upon the links
Or trips along the leas
In gladsome rags like Oxford bags •
Up-gathered at the knees.
The “pins” below look daintier so,
The feet seem “minus threes.”
She pirouettes through tennis sots
(At least I s’pose she will) ;
Her contours hid vast pants amid,
Obscured her outlines. Still.
A biped plain—a Jess or Jane
As forked as any Bill.
In cut-short “strides” she floats or glides
Along the springy green
With more to drape the'hour-glass shape.
The form divine to screen,
Than in the daj's that hugged the craze
Of billowy crinoline.
She w'alks, the lady of my delight,
“Plus fours” her witching wear ;
Those glorious curves Greek art preserves
Concealed from vulgar stare—
Or, with no less effectiveness,
The fact that none are there.

WhAT A NIGHT!
“Good job our reives don’t know where we got to last night.”
“Too true! By the way, where did we get to!”
“Blest if I know.”
“Up North” : Have you ever heard timber
“talking” in a mine during a night shift? It has
many voices. It is best not to listen long, for
they grow loud with life and insistent W'arning.
During the day the mine is as a rule busy' with
the sounds of men and moving trucks, the song
of hammer and drill, the thud of picks. But in
the quiet stopes you can still hear the timbers
“whispering.” In the silence of night yoii’ll hear
one timber gently “creak,” then another, and still
another, now close by, now far aw'ay. Then many
props w'ill cry out in unison, as if the great weight
were pressing them down. Soon you’ll hear a little
long-drawn sigh as if in the relaxation of ease; then
comes an outbreak of groaning further along as
though the weight, failing to break the opposing
props, had slid further on to fresh assault. Far
along a gallery comes a report like a pistol crack.
Probably some lone prop unaided in trying to bear
its burden has snapped. At times I've heard the
timbers literally shrieking, and as the varying
weight exerts a different influence on the straining
timber, the medley is often terrifyingly weird.
* * * *
“KHz”: Many white men in Broome
(N.-W.A.), sufferers from rheumatism, are copying
the Malay and Koepanger crews’ fashion of wearing
armlets. These are crudely fashioned out of sca-
ebonv. When first seen by the white man they
were taken for ornaments, but inquiry elicited that
they are used as charms to keep off rheumy twinges.
The white man professes to have found that these arm-
lets relieve rheumatism, but do not effect a cure.
* * * *
“Veronal”: Some of our Australian ex-
plorers did their fair share of culinary pioneering
as well. Stuart, while blazing a track through Central
Australia in 1858-62, records that lie “dined an
’possum, the first we have seen.” With some pun-
gent sauce to overcome the gum-leaf flavor, he
pronounced it not bad, the flesh being white, like
chicken. Later on he was reduced to crow- cooked
in the ashes, the “first food we have had for the
last three days.” It sat well on the empty stomachs,
Stuart said. At another stage the party regaled
themselves on wild currants, which were found in
great abundance —some with a “tart and saltish
taste,” another variety much better flavored. Pigs’
face ( mesembryanthemum) was also sampled, and
afforded nourishing pasture likewise for the horses.
McKinlay was reduced to even greater straits. His
menu at times included greenhide soup and often
crow stew.
* * * *
“A.E.Y.”: The first two bales of cotton
grown in the Fassifern (Q.) district were produced
by Cleary, of Blantyre, in response to an offer by
one Archibald, who 40 years ago put up two gallons
of rum as a reward for the man who sent in the first
two bales to Harrisville. There the first ginnery in
the district was subsequently situated. Cleary and
his brother organised a party, at which there were
to be dancing and singing, to the accompaniment of
the concertina. All the neighbors were invited. The
rum, however, won the day. When the guests began
to arrive on horseback, one moonlight night, they
were met at the door by an Irishman with a scythe,
who offered to bet them he could mow their legs
off quicker than they could skip out of the way.
When, with a deft sweep, he nicked in two pieces
the saddle-girth of one of the lady riders, most of
the guests took to the bush and the party broke
up hastily.
* * * *
“Taliarangi” : In liis manner of concealing
precious relics the Maori is remarkably shrewd; but
he is also exceedingly casual about ensuring their
recovery. Rangiriri is chief of the Ngati-Tuara tribe,
from whom I acquired my land. On it was the
Horo-i-Rangi, a mysterious goddess, now, thank
Heaven, safe in the
Auckland Museum. No-
body except Rangiriri
knew of her existence.
Then, somewhere in the
cliffs and caves there
is an ancient carved
box r ontaining the
Sacred Hair, the sym-
bol of the wargod
Maru. Also there is a
black stone image, the
name of which was not
disclosed to me, and
Other oddments scat-
tered over the place.
Rangiriri is the only
man who knows where
these things are. Occa-
sionally the dear old
chap will go out at
night to inspect his
treasures, and call at
the camp in the early
morning for a chat
about things in general.
One day he took my
breath away when he
calmly announced that
he had transferred the
contents of an entire
burial-ground to my
side of the fence; in
token of which he gave
me a quaint little
greenstone pendant,
presumably the prop-
erty of one of the
illustrious dead! The
good old man’s poetic
formula of farewell
never varies; “My son,
give me a horse for
the road which lies be-
fore me.” On that morning, early as it was, I
got out another glass for myself. What would you
do if .you were unexpectedly presented with a fully-
occupied cemetery ?
* * * #
“A.J.F.”: “Citrus” (B. 24/9/’25) asks
if lemon drinks and oranges are good for rheumatics.
Can’t give him any advice about that, but I am
satisfied that orange-skin can’t be beaten as a cure
for malaria. First heard of it, when on the Gold
Coast in 1894, from the skipper of a Congo tender.
He told me to get an orange-skin, break it in pieces
into a cup, pour boiling water on it and drink when
it had cooled. Did so, with much benefit, as did
several others of the crew', and none of us had a
return attack up till the time I signed off about
nine months later. I had no more malaria until 1911,
when I got re-infected at Cairns (Q.). Oranges not
being procurable up there at the time, I had to stick
to quinine until I got down south again. At the
present time I’m as free from malaria as if I had
never been in the tropics. I found the Queensland
dose harder to shift than the African one, and put
it down to a different mosquito, but the orange-
skin tea shifted it. Have any other Abos. tried it?
THE MIXTURE.
“I hope you’re satisfied, madam.”
“Perfectly, thank you. Ai was told to give the baby half milk and half watah, and yours
is just right.”
“Polycarp”: Binghi’s marvellous sight is
as highly developed as other of his senses. I have
seen a Taroom (Q.) abo. repeatedly locate a ’possum
by the sense of smell, and the hole he chopped out
always proved he was right. In shallow lagoons
the gins use their feet as much as their hands, both
for locating and for picking up, and most blacks
can tell exactly what creature moves in the long
grass by the kind of rustle it makes. The only crude
sense is that of taste; it is no more advanced than
the emu’s.
* * * *
“Bunya” : “G.A.’s” predatory insect would
sell out after witnessing the performances of the
handsomely-marked Bananaland robber-fly, who also
looks the part. Having watched one take four or
five insects on the wing within half an hour, some
of them bigger than himself, I swatted him for
examination, and found a long, bayonet-like spike in
front, great protruding eyes, and powerful legs. These
big shining flies do more damage about beehives
than the maligned bee-bird. But they deserve their
keep, as they also help to keep the blowfly pest
in cheek.
“Centre”: “Citrus” (B. 24/9/’25) can
take it from me that those who advised him to eat
oranges for rheumatism knew what they were talking
about. Six large navel oranges a day—two on rising
two at noon, and two before going to bed—put me
right in little over a month, and that after nearly
two years of fruitless trials with advertised and
medically prescribed “cures” in bottles and other
containers. I can’t speak regarding lemons, hut
know a man in N.Q. who uses fresh lemon-juice
an embrocation, and swears by it.
“X.N.0.”: Superstitions have much the
same origin all the world over, and the grotesque
carvings on the bows of the Solomon Island canoes
mentioned by “Bullwhanger” (B. l/10/’25) are prob-
ably for the purpose of frightening away evil spirits.
In which case their origin would be much the same
as that of the eye which is invariably painted on
each side of the bow of the Maltese “dghaisas.”
These eyes are to enable the boat to see its way and
to detect Old Nick should he be about. No Maltese
will take his boat across the harbor at night without
a companion, even if the latter is only a very diminu-
tive boy, and invariably one pulls his oar while the
other pushes, gondola-fashion. This ensures a look-
out ahead and astern.
* * * *
“Bullwhanger”: Last year I had the good
tuck to see two Santa Cruz ocean-going canoes under
sail at sea just after a nasty squall had piled our
ship on a reef where she ended her days. They were
coming from Reef Islands to Utupua (one of the
Santa group), a distance of about 80 miles across
open sea, with a fine, stiff breeze on the quarter.
Bowling along “with a bone in their teeth” they
looked fine and soon left our lifeboat astern. This
type of canoe is made out of a big, softwood log,
is about 40ft. long, hollowed out and, with the ex-
ception of a well amidships which has a high coaming
round it, is completely decked-in. The outrigger-
bearers are stepped in this well, and if the boat
requires baling, a “hand” can go into it and throw
out the water over the coamings. The outrigger,
which is about Bft. wide, extends to the float about
12ft. from the boat, is raised over the later about
sft. and is solidly decked. On this deck and over
the float is built a small leaf-house for accommoda-
tion and the storage of taro, yam, eoeoanuts and
other kaikai necessary for a long voyage. The
mast, sail and rudder are also carried by the out-
rigger. The mast itself is short, and w'hen raised
does not stand upright, but is fixed at an angle to
the pear-shaped sail. There are only two ropes
needed, the halliard and sheet, and when the former
is hauled on the mast and sail go up together. When
tacking, the boat is not put-about, but the sail is
lowered, swapped end for end and hauled up again.
This work does not take a native more than 10
seconds to carry out. The rudder, which is held in
place by two beckets, is flopped over the other
side of the outrigger and the boat goes off not on
the other tack, but really astern. The outrigger is
kept to leeward. The two we saw were evidently
family affairs, as there were several pairs of black
feet sticking out of the house and a Mary sat with
a baby in front of it. A couple of pigs and the
inevitable half-starved dog were on board, and on a
heap of sand surounded by stones a small fire
Yams, taro and other food were stowed
away into odd corners. After getting ashore we
had a good look round the canoes and found the
rigging and sail efficient to the last degree. The
deck-seams were well caulked with fibre and gum, and
the lacings and lashings were works of art.
* * * *
“Tamornie”: Re “Morob” (B. 24/9/’25)
and his rufous-headed natives. These are frequently
met with in New Britain and New Ireland, where the
use of lime as a hair-dressing is popular, the color
being the result of its use. That in the case of the
natives described by “Morob” the pubic hair and
that in the axilla was not rufous should have caused
him to pause before making his statement. The use
of lime has a bleaching effect, and when for any
reason its use is discontinued for a little time, the
PRIVILEGED.
Dissolute Kookaburra: “Steady, m' dear
—no violence! Remember, I'm—hie—

hair becomes “ginger,” gradually resuming its original
black hue. I have seen an albino native appear at
a sing-sing with hair of a vivid blue, but he excited
no more comment than the appearance of ordinary
natives with snow-white freshly-limed hair.

FALLOW SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On Grenfell slopes the furrows run
To meet the young October sun
That sheds the glory of his light
On fallowed swell and timbered height;
And ploughmen speed the disc and share
To leave a red horizon bare.
Across the billowed seas of wheat
The wind is drifting clean and sweet,
And, blending through the leafy trees
With dulcet native melodies,
From every bough there floats a song
Beside the road to Burrangong.
The driving rain may hold aloof
From planted field and rippled roof;
And yet the wheat shall grow' apace
Its drying seedbed to efface.
For all the loam was fallowed well
Ere summer wove its burning spell.
“Go, fallow, fallow after rain
Before old summer flares again 1”
The cry is heard and heeded still
By furrou'cd slope and planted hill.
The teams are marching o’er the loam,
Advancing far, retreating home.
Before a fierce December comes,
Made loud with racing thresher-drums
That break the brittle straw and beat
The swollen heads to free the wheat,
’Neath cloudless skies, in days divine,
Light hearts are speeding disc and tine.
’Neath frames of good Australian steel,
The shares, like skiffs, keel chasing keel,
Are folding off the fragrant sod
Behind the toiling teams Which plod
Along the aisles of evening light
Whose furrows run from day to night!

STRETCH
that’s the answer!
Why SUPERTWIST is needed in balloon tyres
You remember how the tyre-makers
always warned you to keep your tyres
pumped up hard?
There was a reason for that.
The essential principle of the high-
pressure tyre was resistance to the
shocks and blows of travel.
Now the balloon tyre is wholly differ-
ent in principle; it is designed to
absorb these shocks and blows.
So you can readily see that the balloon
tyre requires a different type of
material than was formerly used.
Goodyear realised this requirement in
the beginning, and at once set about
finding a suitable material.
After long and repeated experiment it
developed and perfected Supertwist,
a new cord fabric with special values
for balloon-tyre design.
Supertwist is unlike ordinary cord
fabric; its superiority consists in its
greater elasticity.
It far outstretches the breaking-point
of the cord fabric ordinarily employed.
When a tyre made of this new material
strikes a stone, the Supertwist cords
take the blow, yield, stretch, and
recover, distributing the impact over
a larger portion of the tyre.
More Cords take the strain; the shock
is smothered in resilience; the elas-
ticity of the tyre protects it from stone-
bruise, carcass-breaking, and like
injury.
The result is a longer-wearing greater-
mileage tyre, a tyre of extreme
economy.
You want Supertwist and its benefits
—you get them in full measure only
in Goodyear Tyres.
Supertwist is used only by Goodyear
and is built into Goodyear Balloon
Tyres of both kinds —to fit new
wheels, or in most cases to fit the
wheels now on your car if with straight
side or 30 x beaded edge rims.

“Bangarang” : To the giant ’roo mentioned
by “The Rumpus” (B. 17/9/’25) let me add another
whopper brought to hook on Moira station, near
Deniliquin, a few years ago. This was a red kangaroo,
the pegged out skin of which measured 12ft. 3in.
! from nose to tip of tail. A grey specimen killed
on Coolong last year was said to have measured an
inch over Oft. These wonderful specimens missed
being preserved for posterity in a museum, so the
figures cannot be given formal recognition. The best
official record I can find is that of a red one in
the British Museum measuring Bft. 6in.
“S.C.”: “Broome’s” sea-snakes (B.
17/9/’25) may not he in the habit of making
terrestrial excursions, hut there is one species—
the wandering sea-snake (Platunis laticaudatm ) —
which is sometimes seen at considerable distances from
the water and is so built that it can easily progress
over dry land. It has a wide range, from the Bay
of Bengal through the China seas to the South
Pacific. This marine serpent has been seen sunning
itself on beaches about Port Jackson, but when sur-
prised has wriggled back into the water and avoided
capture. j)ur commonest sea-snake, the yellow-bellied
variety, never leaves the water of its own accord, hut
is occasionally flung up on beaches in heavy weather.
I have found one on a N.S.W. South Coast beach
which, though a little shrunken in body, was easily
identified. The gape of most of these snakes is very
small; hence they are never taken by hook and line,
as the black snake occasionally has been. About 12
species of sea-snake occur in our waters, all highly
venomous; they include the deadly Indian variety
known to science as Enhydrina mil: ay den.

“Borom”: Though the oucalypt is re-
garded as a native of Australia, there seems to be
room for at least, doubt as to whether all the varieties
are indigenous. In riot only South America hut the
THE FIRE OF SPRING.
“Wha’ say, boays! Shall us gone up pub, ’are drop beer, an’ praaisc
each other up bit?”
Pacific Slope of U.S.A., the tall white- 'and the red-
gum grow profusely, and I have seen specimens of
both as widely apart as Seattle in Washington,
Nogales in Arizona and San Jose in California. Every-
where they flourish, and trees of a great height are
'seen. Many of them must be well over 100 years
old according to the generally accepted methods of
calculating the age of a tree,' and this fact alone
makes it seem probable that they are not importations.
Also, red-gums are to he seen growing considerably
above sea-level in the Andes, where.it is extremely
unlikely anybody ever went to the trouble 'of planting
them.
“Quero”: An opossum hunter at Okoia
(M.L.) found a strange animal in a trap the other
day, and brought it into town for identification. It
was recognised as a European polecat, and as several
have been reported in the district it is presumed
they are the progeny of one that escaped from some
travelling circus. Considering the polecat’s repu-
tation as a poultry thief and general marauder, its
advent in the countryside is not popular-.
* * * *
“Pick”: Ringbarking and clearing where
the bracken-fern grows is a sure way to spread
that pest. Usually bracken stands back on rocky,
knobs or along the fringe of forest glades or swamps,
but when the timber dies the fern works overtime in
choking the whole area with tangled masses. At
Sunnyside, on the N.S.W. South Coast, the bracken
threatened to drive the cows off the runs. Sam
Poole, an owner, decided to give it a go. He
fenced in the pest, and put on a gang of 150 pigs.
In a few months they eradicated the bracken, and
meanwhile fattened themselves for the market on
its roots.
"Coot" : In the National Herbarium at the
. Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, is to be seen the actual
specimen of the crimson bottle-brush flower and
foliage collected in 1770 by Banks, the botanist to
Capt. Cook’s expedition ; also the specimen of lianksia
s err at a collected by the same scientist. Near by arc

“Polycarp”: The wombat, platypus or
rabbit lias yet to be born that can compete with
the native anteater as a shifter of dirt. He
usually begins a meal With a few minutes’ vigorous
pig-rooting on an ants’ mound, the dirt flying in
all directions. Then the long, sticky tongue is
brought into play. If caught on very hard ground
lie will usually curl into a ball of stiff spines, but
I’ve seen him simply disappear into sandy soil.
The quaintest thing in all the bush is the young
white anteater before either hair or spines have
developed.

“Goolara”: To trap ravens, which. do so
much damage in Western N.S.W., a pen is constructed
of wire-netting, its sides being about 6ft. high, and
forming a square, in the centre of which a dead
sheep is placed. An opening is left in the centre
of the covered top and a netting funnel inserted.
Across this a stick rest is placed. If possible
a live raven is placed in the cage as a decoy.
I have seen half a dozen birds thus caught in
one night. If regularly , attended to, such a trap
will not cause the death of magpies and kooka-
burras, as they may be liberated.

so quickly? I’ve seen
niggers recover from
spear wounds though
the long, barbed spear-
heads protruded a foot
through the body. A
big black foot was
pressed against the
wounded man, and the
swaying haft wa s
twisted and pulled out
by main strength, its
barbs bringing with
them flesh, etc. After
that a handful of roots
and herbs was boiled
down and placed over
the wound, and a
plaster of feathers and
mud applied. In three
weeks the patient was
sneaking through the
bush trailing the man
that spiked him. Yet
an- abo. will lie down
and die without a. mur-
mur when the witch
doctor points the
“bone” at him. A
white man nearly
always collapses under
a spear wound through
the body, and if he
does not die within a
few hours; he generally
has a lingering death
extending over weeks.
Yet under certain condi-
tions what would kill
a nigger with fright
and shock wouldn’t so
much as shake the ash
from the white man’s
cigarette. It’s the grim
old war I’m thinking of. now.

“X2X” : So many instances of what seems
to be an unmistakable telepathic communication be-
tween one person and another have been recorded (B.
17/9/’25) that it makes one wonder whether it is
not possible under given circumstances for an indi-
vidual to transmit a kind of wireless wave which is
picked up at the other end by the mind attuned to
receive it. That certain insects possess this power of
communication between one sex and another has
recently been proved beyond doubt. Other creatures
higher up in the scale are also believed to possess
a. similar power, and it is not unlikely that it has
been developed to its highest point in man. The
human mind is so extraordinary a structure that such
an ability on its part would not be at all surprising,
and it may be that this -organ has anticipated by
thousands of years the most modern discoveries of
science.

“Atherton”: Are .these facts links inj a
chain which in past centuries bound the tribes 1 of
men together. Berosus, a high-priest of Baal, wa? a
Babylonian historian and is supposed to have lived, in
A REAL HELPER.
NEW FORD DRIVER (whose car has broken down ): “D'you know anything about a Lizzie?”
BYSTANDER: “Well, I know a lot of funny stories.”
the time of Alexander the Great. He has left us an
account of the Deluge,: also of Oannes and his dis-
ciples, or tribesmen, the Annedotus, beings who were
half human and half fish, tree or animal. They
appeared to the ancient Babylonians and instructed
them in the arts and sciences. The Aussie abo. is
far removed geographically from these vanished civili-
sations and far inferior to them mentally. Yet a belief
is held by Northern tribes akin to that of ancient
Babylon. He believes that the Great Spirit sent
down to the earth beings in the form of half-
man and half-fish, tree or animal. These creatures
originally spread over the land, making the earth
habitable for the coming of men.

“Pfella”: Some turkeys are hard to kill.
Along the wheat belt near Dalwallinu (W.A.) mv
mate and I spotted a fine specimen about 75 yards
away. Out of sight we crouched, and I brought my ,
repeating-rifle into action. The first shot caused
a spring into the air, the second a similar rise, but
not so energetic. Shot followed shot with a lessening
spring to each flight of lead until finally, at the
tenth pull of the trigger, the bird crumpled into
a heap. On examination we found both wings broken
and the holes where seven bullets had passed through
its body% one, probably the la'st, having pierced the
heart.

“Dr. Nil” : “Keith K.” asks (B. 24/9/’25)
how the noise on the. N.T. “drone-pipe” is made.
Here it is, then: —
. You play it like a cornet.
And make a dismal tone
Half like an old-man hornet
And half a dingo’s moan.
It won’t play. “Annie Rooney,”
Nor even “Scots Wha Ha’e,”
But drives the bunyips looney
And scares the crocs, away.
* * *
“Jesmond”: According to Professor
Barker, of Leeds Uni., it may soon be possible to gel
two or three shearings a year. An invention by a
.Taiwanese doctor is said to do the trick: it is claimed
that if the fluid is injected into sheep every other
day the usual 12 months’ growth of wool will be
produced in two months. Unfortunately no mention
is made of the cost of the preparation or of any
possible ill effects on the sheep.
* * * *
“Lily-Beale”: New Guinea owns a moth
of extraordinary habits. Its usual home, when a
caterpillar, is in an ants’ nest, its lips being
specially fashioned for picking up and eating its
hosts’ pup®. If the ants anticipate revenge when
the caterpillar becomes in turn itself a pupa, they
are disappointed, the skin of the chrysalis being so
tough that it is proof against attack. Waiting for
the chrysalis to split and disclose a tender young
moth is equally vain, for when it emerges it ‘ is
covered with fine silky threads as sticky as bird-
lime. A magnifying-glass shows the ants trying
to rid themselves of the entangling stuff, and when
they attempt a final onslaught on the intruder, the
moth, vibrating its wings at the rate of thousands
of beats a minute, dries its protective covering,
suddenly casts it off and soars away.
* * * *
“Gouger”: The leopard can’t change his
spots, but most Australian ’roos do the color of
their overcoat. In autumn the red ’roo throws off
the deep red, which is only on the long hair tips,
and the grey under-fur begins to grow. As the
season passes, the long hair gradually grows through
the fur, and the red color is carried in the summer.
This long hair is really the animal’s raincoat; the
under-fur is for warmth. The further north the
’roos live the less fur they grow ; the further south
the more hair. One ’roo, the antelopine, confined
to the Northern Territory, wears only a short, coarse
hair coat without an undervest.
“Polycarp”: One of the most impressive
customs of the old Kurnai tribes was the appeal to
the Dead Hand in times of danger. After a native’s
death his hand was cut off, dried, and given to one
of bis near relatives. It was hung round the neck
attached to a string made from ’possum hair, and
i.when danger was apprehended the wearer took it oft
and held it suspended in front of his face. Various
questions were then asked, and the answers were
construed from the way the hand turned or vibrated.
“Bunya” : Noticed the variation in color of
the death-adder? Has it the power of changing to
blend into its surroundings, as the big river-frog
certainly has? I have seen the little fat brutes
sandy-grey in the dust on open tracks, brown and
yellow, dark, or light on different soils, and quite u
bright briclc-red in the ironstone country of Western
Queensland. As it is never out of harmony with the
local color scheme, I believe that the reptile can
change its hue as the curlew can control that of its
eggs. The death-adder is a slow and sluggish creature,
and perhaps this power is its protection against
snake-eating birds.
“Slam”: Our o.aglehawk is, in fact, the
world’s largest eagle, but we can’t blame people for
doubting it when bird-men themselves are inaccu-
rate. One authoritative text-book gives our eagle’s ex-
panse of wing as 7ft., yet I have myself shot and
measured two eagles both exceeding 10ft. in stretch
of wing from tip to tip without straining. I took
careful measurements of one bird to settle an argu-
ment. Its length was 3ft. Sin., and the tail measured
lft. 6in. Official records of its great rival, the
golden eagle of Europe, are: length, 2ft. Sin.; tail,
lft. lin.
“Sue Shannon” : When you drink the ice-
cold water from the lakes and rivers of the Lake
country of the Apple Isle a thirst is started, and you
feel as though you must keep on drinking. When
we go droving that way we always make a billy
of tea to quench our thirst. One can understand
these high altitudes making one hungry, but why
ice-water should give one a thirst is not so easily
comprehended. The coldness of the water is intense.
When we pasture cattle in this part of the country
we. sometimes find them with their legs rotted off.
They cross the ice-cold streams to reach the rich
grasses between, and the water causes the legs of
the animals to decay. I have heard old hands of
this part of the Speck tell of a frost which cut a
great belt of forest to the ground. Everything within
that zone died—undergrowth, animals and birds.
Kangaroos were found frozen beside the great dead
trees.
ALL SQUARE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I could not quite understand Brown yesterday.
We passed, and I spoke in the usual way;
But he seemed not to hear me and said not a word—
Just looked on the ground ; yet I’ll swear that he
heard.
I spoke to my wife of his strange attitude,
For Brown, a good fellow, had never been rude.
.She quickly explained through the. evening meal.
“He snubbed you—the Browns have an automobile.”
1 stormed and I railed of false pride as a curse,
Democracy riiled by the size of a purse.
I bitterly stated, in anger intense,
That friendships are only a matter of pence.
But now all is well and we’re cobbers again.
His wife made him buy it. He pleaded in vain.
The snub is forgiven and friendship restored—
’Twas shame made him pass. It’s a second-hand Ford.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
Two literary lions who have been roaring
through the palmy wastes of the Australia’s
winter garden are Robert H. Davis, the editor
of Munsey’s, and Samuel G. Blythe, of the
Evening Post. For just a quarter
of a century Mr. Davis has been in the chair
of the big New York magazine, but he has
managed to keep his hair, teeth and sense
of fun out of the circle of Time’s scythe, and
is still good as new. He has another
claim to fame: he is probably the record cor-
respondent of the world —he has letters from
thousands of writers, and reckons that, if
it were now fashionable to write on bricks
instead of notepaper, he could build himself
a private Tower of Babel. He thinks “Home
is Best” is the motto writers should adopt.
“Never rush to the nearest city to find the
track to fame. A city makes a man think
in revenue, and that is killing hundreds of
writers every year. It is not where you
write but what you write that catches an
editorial eye.” For instance, take the case
of Bulletin writer Dr. Charles Maclaurin
—the doctor who lived between his Mae-
quarie-street practice and his home at Rose
Bay. Over two years ago, travelling on the
Muritania, Mr. Davis picked up a copy of
"Post Mortem.” So struck was he by the
individual note of the book that he wire-
lessed a publisher-friend the news of his find,
and on the Munsey magnate’s say-so an
American copyright was arranged for by
cable. It was principally to visit Maclaurin
that the Australian trip was undertaken (it
is the first long holiday in 25 years) ; but
before the American had left ’Frisco the
doctor had died.
Mr. Davis thinks that, as writers, Aus-
tralians are too imitative and not intensive
enough. “Write about your own little cii'de
in your own little corner of your own big
continent. Then you will make a literature
that the world will clamor for.” As the six
highest-paid writers (four of them are
women) iu America got their start with
Munsey’s its editor’s words are worth re-
membering. It is romance in a MS. that
makes publishers reach for their cheque-
books: but romance is too often forgotten,
ousted by sex—“the undertone of indecency
that is the only reason for many a novelist’s
overdraft.”
The Munsey chief’s parting words were
ominous. “Fat and laughter are wedded.
And laughter is being dieted out of the
nations with every ounce of fat that men
and women massage from their systems.
Thin bodies and sour faces! Never has the
writing world been so empty of roaring
merriment, and never has the ideal of lean
alertness been more omnipresent.”
Old Bulletin readers will remember black-
and-white artist Nankivell. Years ago, just
after lie left Australia, he and his friend
Davis ran a brilliant but short-lived paper
called Ciiic in ’Frisco. Other Australians
who have been his friends were Louis Beeke
and James Francis Dwyer.
This week positively reeks of hygienics,
eugenics and disinfectants. Sydney is deep
iw its yearly wrnek of health-lore. Dr. Truby
King, knight ot the baby’s bath, from Maori-
land, started off with a demand for a better
chance for the infant: under Inis care and
the Blanket system, the infantile mortalitv
it" Maoriland is the lowest in the world.
When he spoke at the Education Depart-
ment’s assembly rooms and at the Millions
Club on Monday, he was followed with the
interest that always attaches to the man
who loves his job. Sydney’s health autho-
rity Dr. Purdy, Innes Noad, Dr. Margaret
Harper, Dr. Grace Boelke and a room-full
of earnest men and women decided that more
must be done to reduce our own baby losses.
"’Should a doctor tell?” ‘'Oh, he must!”
said Justice James in a bqeach-of-promise
case in Sydney last week; and there is go-
ing to be a little more restraint in future
when the doctor is called in. Worse, there
may be a longer hesitation when a doctor
ought to be seen. It seems to be a case
for Miss Preston Stanley’s ’attention; the
Jaw ought to make it quite clear in what
rare cases a doctor must speak.
From the school gardens for 50 miles
about Sydney the choicest flowers had been
plucked, and the result wasi a great fore-
gathering of beauties at the Education Gal-
lery last week-end. The Show was one of
the successes of the Horticultural branch
ot the Teachers’ Federation, and the display
of roses and carnations was something for
all hands to be proud of. Reading such
legends as “Three Dark Roses, Five Dock”
—or Petersham or Carlton—one saw not
only the blooms but the desire for beauty
growing up in the minds of innumerable
small girls and boys. It is training such as
this that; is going to turn the back yard into
a bit of the Talley of Sharon. The room
warm with their fragrance brought back
Miss Sarah Hynes’s story of the old lady of
Woolloomooloo who had turned her unpromis-
ing yard into an old-fashioned, flower-starred,
creeper-twined gladness. “There are nights
when I can’t sleep at all,” she said; “then I
come and sit out here, and I’m a little girl
back in Devon.” Dream nights aren’t, after
all, a bad return for an hour or so’s garden-
ing each day.
Two of the jolliest dances of the week
were the undergrads’, at the Palais, and that
of the voluntary helpers at the Children’s
Hospital. The first was a monster affair
which packed the Moore Park hall of de-
lights. It netted the State Exes, and
daughter Elaine in a blue-and-gold draped
and Faculty-bannered pen, into which during
the evening such highlights of education as the
MacCallums and Cecil Pursers and the bridge
Bradfields entered to do their reverence. Of
the students who navigated the dance H. M.
Saxby and E. Weekes Av°re the secretaries,
and K. F'lavelle the treasurer; A. L. Charl-
ton held the high office of president.
The happy-looking hospital helpers fore-
gathered at the Ambassadors, and under the
presidency of Eleanor Speer, their comman-
dant, had the time of their young lives,
though their objective was purely mercenary
-•—the night’s takings are to revitalise their
hospital-cot fund. Dozens of pretty crea-
tures flowered the landscape, and youthful
office-bearers almost audibly counted heads
in their delight over the night’s success.
The frocking and the decorations put a
lustre on the dance in aid of the Infants’
Home at Ashfield. The Ambassadors was a
bower of flowering peach for the occasion,
and there was a tremendous roll-up of social
aspirators in the snug-fitting frock of the
moment that the Girl in the Flat Opposite
calls plaster-of-paris. Present; Professor
MaeCallum’s lady, president of the Home,
looking at once regal and benevolent in black
georgettes overlaid with gold embroideries
and fringe; Mrs. George Michaelis, high
priestess of the ball committee, in flame
georgettes weighted with bead embroideries;
the good-looking medical Eakin couple, with
one of the biggest parties; Gwen Marks add-
ing fur-bordered turquoise frocking to the
general joyousness. The educational Gladys
Marks scintillated in black and silver sequins,
and secretary Mrs. L. W. Cohen flashed
cheerful chiffons beflowered rosily.
Quite a wave of excitement is beating
about Sydney over the arrival of Marie
Narelle. Now
Mrs. Currie, of
Long
the well-known
soprano of a
decade or so
ago returned
to her own
country on
Sunday. With
her came son
Reginald (mar-
ried and a
father), who
is over here
on a business
trip in con-
nection with
shale oil. A
host of Marie’s
cousins and
old friends
dropped into
the Australia
to greet her
on Sunday afternoon ; Mayor Stokes hosted
a civic welcome on Wednesday: she will
sing at the Day Nurseries matinee to-day
(Thursday), and towards the week-end there
will be another foregathering of the clans.
The poor old moth went to bed hungry the
other night, and they are agitating for the
intervention of the S.P.C.A. The Imperial
Service Clubbers ruthlessly dragged their
uniforms from the very teeth of the hungry
insect, and went off to the Wentworth, Scar-
let and gold, blue and gold of the Navy,
unobtrusive khaki and the olive of the flying-
man, all more or less heavily decorated,
crowded into the big ballroom and the palm-
court ; and a reception committee that in-
cluded a general, a major, a colonel, a com-
mander and a lieutenant were lined up to do
the honors. Commander Lambton and
General Goddard smiled at the head of the
line, and large bunches of congratulations
were handed out to the four heroes who
started and kept the ball rolling. They were
Major Murray, Commander Patrick, Lieuten-
ant Mant and Mr. Blytliman. Commodore
Wardle squired daughter Jean to the ball in
lilac georgettes, mauve and silver were the
color scheme of Mrs. Lambton’s froclting, and
the mauve note at the official board w r as
again sounded by General Lloyd’s lady. Cap-
tain Gilbert Nobbs and Mrs. Nobbs were
among the dancers, and a good looker in the
big assemblage was Mrs. Pat Levy in flesh-
pinks patterned with diamente.
Tenor George Brooke and pianist Teddy
Cahill have reached a dizzying height of
success. Of them Tennyson might have writ-
ten his famous line: “Duchesses, duchesses
all the w r ay!” But even fame has its bounds.
One night the two young men were the
guests of Mr. and Mrs. Davey at Claridge’s,
and the four Australians had a glad time.
The next night the waiter remarked : “Nice
young gentlemen with you last night, sir.
That little fair one, now, with his hair on
end, I s’pose he’s in the racing business?”
“Well,” replied Mr. Davey, “he doesn’t w T eigli
in, though he often goes to the. scales. He
calls it playing the piano.”
Let’s introduce Harriet Dumolo, the play-
lady wdio has taught literally hundreds of
rather sober-
faced kiddies
to laugh. She
is one of the
greatest kin-
dergarten
workers Aus-
t r a 1 i a has
known. A
student of the
first Kinder-
garten Train-
ing College in
Sydney, she is
herself now
principal of
the new' col-
lege at Wavcr-
ley; in fact,
she has been
in charge of
this branch of
education
since Miss
Jenkins (the former principal) went to
America. May Moore made the picture.
Pretty Mione Stewart, daughter of Dick,
a niece of Sweet Nell and a clever actress in
her own right, became Mrs. James Denyer
last week. St. Mark’s, at Darling Point, was
the trysting-place, and padre Howard Lea
had the assistance of a group of choristers.
Mione, who was given over to her bridegroom
from Cremorne by father, dressed her part
in ivory georgettes and old lace, embroidered
with crystal. A silver train and a volumi-
nous tulle veil added to the thistledown effect.
Patricia Denyer and Beatrice Warren
'maided in lilac frocks and silver poke bon-
nets ; Keith Aikman, of Melbourne, best-
manned, and the bride’s mother distributed
cake at the White City Clubhouse.
The Justice Harveys’ Helen duly became
Mrs. Horace Dalziel at St. Andrew’s, Singa-
pore,’ under mother’s eye, and with Arch-
deacon Swindell to dispense the blessings.
The young man is connected with Sarawak
Oilfields, Ltd., and the new Mrs. Dalziel’s
home will be in Borneo.
One of the newest engagements is that of
Lucy, the youngest of the F. S. B. Falkiner
buds, of Bellevue Hill, to James Lowry, of
the North Island of Maoriland. He is one
of the family W’hose name is emblazoned in
A.J.C. annals.
May Willis, of Killara, has consented to
try the effect of Clive Blackwell’s ring on
her engagement finger. Clive is the young-
est son and partner of dentist Ernest Black-
well, of Macquarie-street, who before he
began his research work in gumtips was one
of the most polished writers in Australian
journalism. May on the distaff side is a
grand-niece of dowager Dame Hay, of Crow’s
Nest; one of her mother’s sisters is mar-
ried to Sir Bruce Porter, the London phy-
sician, and another is Mrs. Richard Arthur,
of Mosman. Any friend of either family read-
ing this can buy the wedding present imme-
diately : the engagement is to be a short one.
Even the storms of last week failed to in-
terfere with the goings-on of “The Honey-
moon Girl.” The bright lads and lasses of
the Bankers’ Operatic Society got on to her
tracks and gaily retold her doings in song
and story to a thrice-filled Conservatorium.
Jack Roff not only produced the thistledown
affair, but played the part of the disappointed
Boots ajt the hotel where everybody gets
tied up in a knot, matrimonial or otherwise.
Eileen Tyler made an attractive Mabel Dur-
ande, and the choruses were so pretty that
the objection steadily growing in banking
circles to electric adding-machines became
not only understandable but commendable.
Sydney' University is eager to honor the
dead it loved and mourns. So the John
Irvine Hunter memorial fund has been
opened. It aims at a portrait of the grave
and gay young genius to hang among his
elders in the Great Hall; to set up a bust
of him in the Medical School; to institute
a Hunter Memorial lecture or oration; to
establish a Hunter library of scientific
works, a Hunter memorial scholarship, and,
ultimately, a Hunter Research Institute. For
all this £105,000 is necessary, but the imme-
diate aim of the committee is £50.000. Pro-
fessors of Anatomy Burkitt and Maguire are
the secretaries; and the executive coinmiitee
includes Dr. Constance D’Arcy as the repre-
sentative of the women grads.
The popular Roys tone Davey couple have
repatriated themselves in their Darling
Point home after nearly a year of travel.
All around the shingled world they have
wandered: through the shaven landscapes of
England; over the wild, carelessly-worn
beauties of Ireland —Ireland with the bitter
word still on her tongue and the smile still
in her eye. Things really are going well
with the Emerald Isle, though, funnily
enough, having given the Saxon his dismissal,
the Celt naively complains of the absence
of English men-o’-war in Dublin Bay. Not
for the Sydney woman the joy of buying
Paris and New York models for next to
nothing; all her garments had to be made
to measure—the fashionable figure abroad is
thin to attenuation, and frocks were so
narrow a healthy Australian schoolgirl would
have burst them. “Every woman I met
looked hungry,” says Mrs. Davey. •
That brilliant young thing Marie Benti-
voglio is just back home after plucking her
degree of Doctor of Philosophy from Oxford.
Marie graduated at Sydney Uni. and later
devoted herself to the elusive crystal. Her
research work in this direction gained her
the travelling scholarship that took her
abroad. Marie, looking childlike in white
chiffons on which pink roses bloomed, was
the guest of the Dante Alighieri Society the
other afternoon. The party was at th'e
Ambassadors, and Dr. Fiaschi, who is pre-
sident of the society, made the official wel-
comes and congratulations; but long before
that a stream of pretty speeches in gayest
Italian had flowed round the heroine.
The committee of St. Margaret’s must have
felt a horrible twitching in the thumbs last
week when, having met to drink tea and
discuss the Maud Fane Cabaret, the news of
that actress’s sickness and of the illness of
secretary George Fitzpatrick was broken to
it. May Sheehan, the hospital’s finance sec-
retary, was the bearer of the tidings, giving
the present address of the lady as .Tenner,
while George Fitzpatrick’s is St. Vincent’s.
Quite a nasty dose of typhoid is his trouble.
However, the committee decided to keep the
flag flying, and the date of the cabaret is
still November 5.
The Westmead Home, which is having its
annual reunion next Sunday, began its kindly
work 33 years ago. Two hundred boys re-
gard the home, overlooking Parramatta Park,
as their own. The Marist Brothers, who
encourage them in the idea, have some won-
derful workshops under their care, where the
lads can learn printing, book-binding, boot-
making, carpentering and tailoring. There
is also a small farm. But it's the 50 chor-
isters and the 40 bandsmen, with their com-
petition stnecesses thick upon them, that are
the real pride of the place. No wonder
they’ve lately formed an Old Boys’ Union.
Sister Brisbane adds :
The Tanda takes the Cadell-Garricks on a visit
to the Geoffrey Archbutts in China, and for a pro-
longed holiday. Another to leave us is Madeline
Clarke, who has been the “social” writer on the
Daily Mail. G. B. Post has snatched her from
a large circle of regretful pals for his tour of
Maorilarkl.
Somerville House old and new girls joined hands
in banditry on behalf of a Science equipment and
gym. Joan Connal handed up a sheaf of pink gladioli
bound in the school colors to Mrs. W. H. Barnes, who
opened the affair. The decorated, stalls were admir-
ably equipped to loosen taut purse-strings.
E. It, B. Jordan arranged the Austral choir sing-
song ip the Exhibition Concert Hall. Maida Marlay,
in Ifcje, gold and blue, touched the piano keys in
solo itiems. The English opera was a feature. Reg
Best d ; id well in “lolanthe,” and Elgar’s dance by the
massed melody-makers was another tip-top turn.
Mr=» Jordan mezzo-sopranoed in an excerpt from “La
Giojcon’da,” and in “The Force of Destiny” had
Gu^do' Caciaili to help her. Eric Havne waved
the» orchestra on and a big house came to clap.
J. C. Newlands drew a crowd to the Albert Hall
on the same night, amongst them the Fowles,
Lockliart-Gibsons, the A. D. Grahams, Mrs. Forrest-,
Barbara Sisley and other lovers of the iambic* pen-
tameter. A slice of “Romeo and Juliet,” bits of John
Masefield and Alfred Noyes, and old border ballads
were some of the things the intrepid elocutionist
presented before a stage setting consisting of a chair,
a table, a glass of water and a travelling clock.
Mrs. Mason Beatty’s son Cyril chose St. Andrew’s
Kirk for his appointment with Lydia Samuels, of
Gfcnholme, Highgate Hill. The Rev. Arnold tied
tifc knot, and the bride wore ivory crepe de Chine.
Hazel ahd Ivy Samuels ’maided. The Jenolan Cafe
safrw the feasting and Tambourine Mountain the
’n»oon. i
The Women's Club has been debating Civilisation.
Mrs. Alan Dakin believes in it; others do not. Mrs.
Mallalieu thought the materialistic side had advanced
too much, and called to witness the poverty of poets.
She thought there were too many physically unfit
alive and that the world was becoming a vast hos-
pital. Excitement ran high, but fortunately there
was a cool change that night.

The Victoria League got in first with its
“Pleased to meet you” to the wife of the new
G.-G. Putting on their gladdest rags mem-
bers assembled at Menzies’ on Friday night,
and Lady Stradbroke did the greetings. Lady
Stonehaven, confessing to being no speech-
maker, said her very brief thanks in peacock-
green satin bordered deeply with steel-bead
embroidery. Leaguers were presented to her
Ex.; and a string orchestra endeavored to
be heard above the clatter and the clink.
Chief Justice Irvine and his lady; the James
Barretts; Rear-Admiral and Mrs. Hall
Thompson, she trailing ivory satin and lovely
lace; the Miller dame a picture in draperies
of pink-and-gold brocade and feather addi-
tions ; and Archbishop and Mrs. Harrington
Lees were amongst the loyalty-leaders. Sec-
retary Elsa Grice wore dainty mauve geor-
gette. Mrs. C. J. Henderson aired the latest
in a coat of gold-beaded lemon and orange
georgette over a harmonising gown. Nest
Malcolm was in black velvet; Dr. Ethel
Parnell, convoyed by her mother, chose pink
rose-patterned georgette. Dr. Walker Sin-
clair's pretty wife was wrapped in two
shades of cyclamen georgette and silver lace:
Mrs. Carty Salmon’s apparel was of lilac
hue, Mrs. Keating’s white and crystal, and
Beryl Ainslie’s pale blue brocade. Honored
guests were Sir Frank Heath, London’s
famous scientist, and his partner, who was
robed in black with jet adornments.
Since the middle of May the Stonehaven
family has had excitement a-plenty. From
the 18th of that merry month dates Sir
John Lawrence Baird’s appointment as
Governor-General of Australia; and within
10 weeks he had by the grace of God and
the favor of George V. become Lord Stone-
haven, his eldest daughter had been wed,
and he had lived with his family through the
thrill of departure for five years’ service in
the Commonwealth.
The new Excellency’s lady, like her hus-
band, has previous knowledge of Australia ;
she was Lady Ethel Sydney Iveitli Falconer,
daughter of the Earl of Kintore, who was
Governor of South Australia in the late
’eighties. They have a family of two sons
(at present at Eton) and three daughters.
Her Excellency has leanings towards art
and music, and is ready to do her bit in
social-welfare work. Her husband lias spent
most of his life in the diplomatic service,
is serious-minded without being dour, is
keen about aviation and attracted to most
branches of sport. Spencer Shier made the
picture for us.
Is there anything more feminine in Mel-
bourne than the weather? On Friday we
sought the shelter of the newly-leafed trees
of Collins-street from a sultry dust-laden
gale; but with 'the morn of Caulfield Cup
day came winter again with a bitter wind,
rain, hail and watery sunshine. Mere
woman, contemplating her millinery pur-
chases for an expected warm spell, wept
aloud while she donned her furs, coat, en-
semble suit and small black hat. Fair patrons
crowded out of the stands spent their time
endeavoring to dodge the showers and cast-
ing longing eyes at the yawning spaces in
the male members’ pen. A packed mass of!
dull coats and frocks, punctuated, like a bed
of tulips, with specks of cyclamen, yellow
and blue, watched Whittier win his race.
The popular event helped to lift the feminine
depression, and all vantage points were
rushed to see the G.-G. hand over to Ben
Cliaffcy the coveted golden vessel.
Lady Stonehaven had the smartest of up-
turned black satin hats, topping a black
caracule coat, cuffed and collared with kolin-
sky. The Countess of Stradbroke, black
robed and hatted, had Helena Rous beside
her, lightening the sable atmosphere with a
wide-leafed brown headpiece. Mrs. Ben
Chaffey received the congratulations on
Whittier’s win in large millinery of rust
hue that topped wrap coating. For the
rest, everybody looked like everyone else
save that there were real, nearly real, and
quite unreal furs; but some full-length capes
of. animal coverings caught critical eyes as
being the newest. The Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers
brightened all-black with gold; Mrs. H. S. K.
Ward, just back from overseas, was tailored
in tan with velour hat of golden brown ; and
Mrs. Clive Leonard, wife of the V.A.T.C.
chairman, carried a natural kasha suit and
a beige ribbon toque. One of the smartest
was Mrs. Allan Spowers, in a nifty frock of
navy-blue suggesting a vivandiere, pleated
of skirt and with short scalloped coat fin-
ished with vieux rose and white silk braid.
Mrs. T. A. Tabart, wife of the V.A.T.C.'s
new secretary, the Weston Pett., Roger
Thomson, Carty Salmon and W. IM. Robins
dames were scabbarded in black of much
distinction. A cheery note was introduced
in the bits of lily of the valley which adorned
many fur coats.
This Chatterer went behind the scenes at
Caulfield on the eve of the Cup, when secre-
tary T. A. Tabart showed how the wheels
go round on the sporting side, and caterer
Greville opened her eyes to the extent of the
punter's appetite. Caulfield course has its
own kitchens, where birds, hams and piles
of pies are prepared in surroundings of de-
vastating cleanliness and efficiency. Neither
fly nor rodent can wander in upon the 13,000
loaves or 20001 b. of turkey ready for the
hungry multitudes. The laundry bill after
Caulfield Cup Day is terrifying, for the crowd
also consumes, so to speak, 14 square miles
of table linen. Opened for the first time on
Saturday was a quick-service luncheon- and
tearoom, to which the public said “Thank
you.” On the merely racing side. Caulfield
leads the world with an electric indicator,
which flashes the correct result over the
whole course before any false information
can be circulated. Prior to inspecting the
mysteries of racing from the inside, the
party, which was headed by Mrs. Tabart,
was refreshed with a cup and nice things
to eat.
The maddest, merriest matinee surrounded
Maggie Moore’s farewell at His Majesty’s
and made her richer by over £l3O0 —and
there is nothing wrong about that 13. A
house crowded to the ceiling included some
folk who had known her right through her
long Australian career. It wasn’t a society
audience by a long way, but there was a
sincerity about it that w r as mighty pleasant.
An air of goodwill was over all —from the
girls of the chorus of “Wildflower” who
wandered around selling programmes in their
bridesmaids’ frocks, to the uttermost amateur
on the bill. The old-time ministrel show of
the first half was joyfully approved ; herein
Andrew Higginson, his beauty disguised be-
hind charcoal, introduced well-known busi-
ness men in tbe gents of color who sat with
cricketer Warwick Armstrong. The other
part of the programme included a little of
everything. Marie Burke, in lemon fringe
attached to gold tissue, warbled a “Carmen”
aria. Gwen Tait, daughter of the Charlie
Taits, wore a red rose mysteriously fixed to
a shingled coiffure, and tangoed with good-
looking Antonio Cansino. A powder-blue
beaded georgette coat over pink framed
Marie La Varre’s offerings. Muriel Starr
was ensemble-suited in floral marocain and
black satin for her comedietta with Frank
Harvey and Harvey Adams. Then there
was Maggie herself with brilliant buttons
upon black lace and satin draperies, the
youngest of the lot, reciting in a soft voice
which carried to the back row of the gallery.
Afterwards, brushing away her tears, she
spoke her thanks from a heart ever young
—that was when Mayor Brunton passed her
the cheque. The auctioning of some
articles by Marie Burke, with incidental
clowning by Gus Bluett, found the squire
of Broome Park scattering tenners, one pur-
chase being a photograph of Maggie Moore
and the late J.C.W. in “Pinafore” —and that,
too, was presented to the favorite. Heaps of
floral offerings for the ladies were augmented
by a lobster or two and a sup of beer for
the minstrels.
Maggie Moore is quite a social butterfly
these days, for folks are keen on ruining lief
digestion before she takes it to America. The
Austral Salon, with Mrs. R. F. McKenzie
and Dagmar Anderson as ringleaders, has
been among the number to speed the favorite
with music, speech and sandwich.
Isabel Handley, in rose-pink draperies behind
armfuls of flowers, found herself bowing to
the enthusiastic shouts of “Author!” when
“The Mandarin Coat” had its first wearing
by the Repertory Society on the 14th. The
players gave the clever comedy a good pre-
miere, the talented lass herself producing it.
Mrs. Elizabeth Apperly dressed the leading
role of Sheila (the purchaser of the Coat)
first in an embroidered frock of hyacintli-
blue and later in sliell-pink. Olive Norman
prinked with tan a black gown and a small
black hat; a fluffy evening frock of wdiite had
its cheer in red roses. But the women didn’t
wear all the fine feathers; Stanley Smith
and Eric Lister, in the make-up of China-
men, donned Oriental garb most gorgeous.
Miss Gladys K. Good, wdio owns this plea-
sant face, is on the staff of the South Austfa-
lian School of
Arts and
Crafts. In
Melbourne on
a visit to her
aunt, Mrs. T.
A. a'Beckett,
the other day
she showed
samples of
pain t i n g o n
china which
caused so m o
flutter at the
Lyceum, where
they were dis-
played. Aus-
tralia's native
flowers, gum-
lea ve s and
con ventional
designs are
made to look
equally at
home on her
pottery and china; and her tooled leather
work is in a class by itself.
Girl Guiding got the expected lift from
the entertainment held on Thursday at the
G.-G.'s dwelling—a combined bazaar, caf6
ehantant _ and bridge-party, with a dance in
the evening. The professionals, including
the “Wildflower” leads, blazed the way in
Spring modes with May Beatty in a fascinat-
ing thing of biscuit hue and ecru lace. Flower-
sellers held all entrances; and many stalls,
fronted with Japanese trellis-work, sold
everything from cakes to camisoles. Lady
Stradbrokc opened the brigandage, and the
new G.-G. and his lady surveyed the com-
mandeering of their home. Organising secre-
tary Mrs. J. H. Hewison had reason to feel
proud of her work. Mrs. Gilbert Lodge and
Mrs. A. 8. Woolcott managed the refresh-
ments, and as a memento left at Lady Strad-
broke’s place at the tea-table a canary in a
gilded cage.
A medley of evening gowns, of ball frocks
that weren’t ball frocks, of family jewels,
and wraps that might have been the parlor
tablecloth gyrated at Government House that
night. To many it was a half-guinea well
spent to jazz around the G.-G.’s ballroom or
sit upon _ the blue-velvet divans. No pen
could paint some of the toilettes. One
maiden was a female Santa Claus in crim-
son-shaded tulle, white fur and berries, and
the demonstrations of “the terpsichorean
art”—it is the only phrase to fit the occasion
—were quite as varied, some trippers cling-
ing to their male partners like the daughter
of the Hesperus after the wreck. Towards
10.30 there stole over the scene the odor
of bacon and eggs—the special menu for
supper; price, half a crown. Fifteen hun-
dred varied but utterly well-conducted jazzers
paid for entrance.
Virgin wdiite is no longer the only wear
for debs. At the Norman Falkiners’ party
to introduce daughter Nancy into society, the
maiden tripped in draped in pale pink with
gold lame additions. Sharing the honors
were Betty Shackell and Shirley Tolhurst,
both visions in rose tones; the first had silver
lace amid geranium crepe, and the other
pearl-embroidered blusli-hued 1 tulle veiling
silver tissue. Mrs. Falkiner gave greeting to
numerous guests—among them Lady Helena
Rous, with silver embroidery upon lilac geor-
gette; Mrs. George Vi vers, in white, crystal-
beaded ; the Russell Grimwades, Mr. and
Mrs. .Jim Fairbairn, and heaps of pretty
lasses.
“Fair and Warmer,” rather more torrid
than when first seen, had a brilliantly success-
ful revival at the King’s on Saturday.
Nellie Bramley, in pleated georgette, got rap-
turous welcome and gardens of blossoms.
Sylvia McNair, who took a large slice of
the popularity, had two pretty coverings,
one of pale lemon georgette, silver trimmed,
and the other of petunia hue.
The most remarkable jumble sale ever held
in Hobart was housed in the Town Hall the
other day when the goods bought and. appro-
priated by a former officer of the Blind In-
stitution, who is now doing three years as
the guest of the King, were offered.. The
curious public simply rushed the building to
see the accumulation of over a dozen years’
pilfering. Variety seemed to have been a
passion with the misappropriator—enough
groceries to stock a couple of shops, furni-
ture ranging from wardrobes and double and
single beds to mouse-traps, scores of blan-
kets, pyjamas, china, glassware of every
description, £3O worth of boots and shoes,
140 pairs of socks, 100 linen collars, slip-
pers, pictures, dungaree suits. Altogether
over £5OO was netted by the sale, which
will go to the funds of the institution.
It has been discovered that Canberra
grows something besides foundation-stones,
for the tulips of the Federal capital are as
wonderful this year as the tuber-begonias of
Ballarat.
The distinction of being the Commonwealth's
only woman municipal councillor belongs to
Mrs. Blanche Ross Watt, who represents
Macedon in the Gisborne Shire Council.
Public service riots on the family tree. Her
late father, Thomas Hamilton, sat in the
Legislative Council, and both her late hus-
band and her brother were members of the
Gisborne Council. Having represented the
sex at Red Cross gatherings of mere men.
male assemblies hold few terrors for her.
She can't be cajoled into a photographic
studio, humorously protesting that her only
picture was a passport effort, which brought
criticism even from the gallant officials of
France.
John Sutton, who was killed in a motor-
cycle accident when this year was young, was
the pride of Trinity College, to which lie be-
longed, as he had been of the Melbourne
Grammar School. Now, as a memorial to
the bright young scholar, some of his verses
and prose are to be collected into a book, and
a scholarship worth £3O per annum at Trinity
College will give an opportunity to other bril-
liant students to achieve the future of which
Fate deprived the youngster after whom it
will be named. He was only 20 when he was
killed.
Melbourne’s most respectable Bohemia
meets every second Sunday evening in the
smoke-laden ballroom of a St. Kilda hotel
and listens to the strains of the old Zingari
orchestra, which toured Europe a couple of
decades ago. The ballroom, which has been
turned into a sort of private museum by
Alfred Adams, who acts as host, is crammed
full with stuffed birds, busts, pictures,
trophies and dust, and Bohemia sips its wine,
gazes hazily through the smoke, and imbibes
some of the best-rendered classical music
in Melbourne.
Adelaide mixes her weather, too:
Rarely, from a frocking' standpoint, has there been
a more autumnal Spring meeting than that just
concluded by the S.A..T.C. at Morphettville—three
days of bleak wind and threatening skies that made
coats, skirts and wrap-coats again a uniform, and
sent picture hats back to their boxes. The acting -
Excelleney Pooles—he has been ill again—sent their
daughter as their representative. Bad starting on
the opening day and hair-raising falls on the holiday
were the chief sensations.
The Forsters, posting back from Terowie at the
news that the Cathay would not call at Fremantle,
went again to Birksgate as the Barr Smiths’ guests,
and were joined there by Mrs. Pitt Rivers.
One-time pupils of the extinct Advanced School
were a few days ago bidden to tea by its old head.
Miss Rees George, at the Elder Kiosk, where speeches
and much conversation of the “Do-you-remember?”
variety were accompaniments to the clatter of the
cups.
There were fewer than usual at the Anzac Hos-
pital at Glenelg when Mrs. Poole opened the annual
sale of disabled soldiers’ handicraft. It is a pity,
because teaching the raffia, cane and leather crafts,
encouraging the men to continue them, and arrang-
ing for the marketing is one of the most valuable
of Red Cross activities-—many a disabled Digger has
thus been put on the road to a tidy income. There
was woodwork, too, exquisitely done, and woollen
dolls, and, for the very young, all kinds of grotesque
and fluffy beasts. By the way, Miss Thomas, the
secretary of the Red Cross Shop, took a host of
Digger good wishes with her when she went avoyag-
ing to England.
The Girl Guides had the Mayor in the chair at
their annual meeting and presented a report that
showed a total membership of 1200 —an increase of
300 in the year. A scheme for fund-raising is the
payment of Id. a week by each guide and guider,
and Mrs. K. D. Bowman has promised to subsidise
the cash so raised.
The Press delegates struck wind, dust and general
abomination for their arrival. Nevertheless, they
rallied bravely to the civic handshaking, the Chamber
of Commerce luncheon (with a special tribute to
the late Robert Kyffin Thomas from Lord Burnham),
a tea party (the daily newspaper proprietors the
hosts) and an English-Speaking Union reception, with
the Astors as the guests of honor. Knowledge that
north-wind and dust usually give way to a deluge
drove most women to the safle neutrality of sombre-
hued marocain for the day-time frivols; and black
held its own at the Liberal Hall when the Astors
spoke to E.S.U. members.

“ The fame of a great name

What do you buy
when you buy a Battery ?
Not a box of chemicals, but LIFE and POWER to turn your
engine and to feed your lights. The more life—the more
power that battery possesses, the better value you have
received for your money.
Westinghouse has found a way to increase the size of the
plates—the vital elements—of the Westinghouse Battery, in
such a manner as to lengthen the life of the battery and at
the same time give a quick ready flow of power for every need
or emergency.
Longer life—more power—at no extra cost make Westing-

SPORTING
NOTIONS
A large section of the crowd on the Caul-
field racecourse hooted heartily when Heroic was
downed by Royal Charter in the Herbert Power
Stakes, three days before the Caulfield Cup. Both
horses are trained at Mordialloc by Holt, but the
demonstration Was more in the nature of a vote of
no-confidence in the chestnut than a suggestion
(which would have been silly, anyway) that his
party did not want him to win. He has been a
ridiculously overboomed horse. Certainly he de-
feated the half-fit Gloaming in the w.f.a. Chelmsford
Stakes at Randwick (the late Ballymena also de-
feated Gloaming in the w.f.a. Hill Stakes at Rosehill
when the old fellow had another week’s condition
on him), but he has never done anything since to
justify the oft-repeated assertion that he is a
“wonder-horse.” He has proved himself a brute
at the barrier and has been licked again and again.
Yet plenty of imbeciles backed him for the Caul-
field Cup at 4 to 1 (less in places) w*eeks before
the race. They did not get a run for their money.
The day after the Herbert Power Stakes the horse
was treated for a swollen fetlock, and as it was
still troubling him on Friday the pen was put
through his name. C. B. Kel low, who owns the
“wonder-horse,” backed him heavily, and must have
lost quite one-fifth of the amount mentioned in the
romantic section of the sporting press.
With Heroic out of it there were 23 runners, and
with the exception of Whittier, Spearfelt and Metel-
lus they were a vary ordinary lot. After his second
to Windbag in, the Spring Stakes at Randwick, and
his third to Heroic in the Caulfield Stakes, in which
he had all the bad luck of the race, Whittier (9st.)
was always a strong public fancy. At the close of
the betting he wap 9 to 2 against. Royal Charter
was second favorite at 6’s; Spearfelt, Our Prince and
Honan were at B’s (the latter firmed from 14 to 1
notwithstanding indifferent track gallops during the
week) ; and there was good money for All Sun-
shine at 14’s, Tookarbv at 15’s, and Manacre at
20’s; 25 to 200 to I were offered about the others. In
the bustle for portions after the barrier was re-
leased Kanehani struck trouble and fell. As they
turned out of the straight Valiant and Palelight were
in front, with Whittier, Batteryman and Noscitur
well in the picture, and Honan and Lemina show-
ing up at the back* of the course. Valiant was
still leading with six furlongs to go, but just before
they came to the borne turn Whittier, getting a
nice run on the rails, went to the front, and the
race was oyer. Galloping beautifully, the gallant
Caulfield Cup by two lengths from the 50-to-l chance
little son of AVoorak arid P<olaeea landed his s'econd
Raith (6st. 71b.J, with the S. Aus. mare Lemina
(Bst. 101 b.), another 50-to-l shot, half a length
away, third. Tookarby, who ran a good race, was
fourth, and Textile and Spearfleit were not far away.
Spearfelt did not manage the sharp Caulfield turns
well, and FJemingrton should suit him better. Honan
was a disappointment, and so were Royal Charter and
Our Prince, but there is an excuse for Manacre, the
only three-year-old in the race—he was nearly
knocked down.
Whittier got a great reception from the crowd,
and deserved it. Lilie Windbag, he is honest as
well as brilliant, and ■ HP doesn’t require a press-
agent to explain and exctise bad manners and vaga-
ries of form. Owned by Ben Chaffey and trained
by H. McCalman, he was ridden a masterly race
by Pike, on his day the finest horseman in Australia.
The time, 2min. 34see., has been beaten on several
occasions, but the track was fairly heavy after
some solid showers. Victorious as a three-year-old
in 1922, when he had the featherweight of 6st. 131 b.,
Whittier is the fifth horse to win the Caulfield Cup
twice. The others were Paris (1892 and 1894),
Hymettus (1898 and 1901), Poseidon (1906 and
1907) and Uncle Sam (1912 and 1914).
A Sarchedon colt in Potentate (4 to 1) got home
in the Gwyn Nursery from Welitha (7 to 2) and
Rotarian (25’s). Cyanate (Cyklon-Arrasene) fin-
ished well in this race, and should be worth a
thought later on. The Burwood Handicap, for three-
year-olds, was taken by Belgamba (10’s), with Am-
bassador ( 6 to 4), who always finds something to beat
him, second, and
Horoscope third.
Belgamba, who has
always been rather
well thought of, is
by Poitrel-Bunee.
He has 6st. 111 b.
in the Melbourne
Cup, and is a dis-
tinct possibility,
for he looks and
gallops like the
stayer he ought to
be on breeding.
Sailing Home (7
to 2) gave Duncan
his sixth winning
ride for the meet-
ing in the AVind-
s o r Handicap.
Duncan has a great
following, and is a
good, vigorous
rider, who doesn’t
indulge in flash
finishes like some
of the so-called
artists of the pro-
fession.
W. H. JOHNSTON, chairman of the V.R.C.
stipendiary stewards.
“Tenakolie”: Whittier’s second Caulfield
Cup success reminds one of Paris’s dual victory.
Nat Gould (then “Verax” of the Referee)
tipped Paris in 1892. and had a good win himself
—in fact, he backed the little gelding for a bit
more than he could afford to risk on his six quid a
week. Nat, by the way, was a bit superstitious, as
many punters and some pressmen are. He went
for a big win on James White’s filly Acme. “How
could I help it?” he shouted excitedly, after the
filly had done the trick. “On form I couldn’t see
what could beat her, and then the word ‘Acme’ in
blue paint on a white ground stared at me every
night on my way home. It was only an ad. for
a new starch on a grocer’s shop verandah, but it
was mv fancy’s name and in AV bite’s colors. ’ The
novelist landed his biggest bet when Newhaven won
the City and Suburban in 1899, as Australian horses
were capable of doing then. He made enough out
of it to build a beautiful villa on the Thames, which
he named Newhaven, and where he entertained many
a visiting Australian of his day.
* * * *
“Hambone”: A chap in our office is
addicted to dreaming on the eve of a big race. The
night before the Metrop. he dreamt he saw “Hamlet
being played in plus-fours, and the way he worked
that out was that Shakspeare wrote Hamlet, and
Shakspeare was the Bard of Avon. A quid straight
out and a quid on the tote returned a nice profit.
Last Saturday morning it looked as if he had thudded.
“Only thing I dreamt of was a ghost,” he told the
boys. “A shivery creature in long robes.” Then
the organiser of our 2s. 6d. office sweep on the Caulfield
Cup came in and announced the result of the draw.
“You’ve got Raith,” he told the dreamer. “Raith,
Raith?” exclaimed the latter. “That’s it. AVhy
didn’t I think of it before?” and off he dashed to
the nearest s.-p. bookie. “Had two quid each way,”
he said when he returned. “He pays a quarter of the
odds for a place. I knew that dream meant something,
but dashed if I could make it out till Bloggs told
me I had drawn Raith. A ghost’s a wraith, isn’t
he?” Raith’s second at 50’s netted him £23. The
boys in the office who have punted on AVindbag are
hoping he’ll dream of a candidate for the Federal
elections the night before the Melbourne Cup.
H* * * *
It was rather astonishing to see Admetus
made a 5-to-2 favorite for the Flying Handicap at
the City Tattersall club’s Randwick meeting, after
his bad last in the w.f.a. race won by Whittier at.
Warwick Farm. The aged Queensland stallion must
have been a good horse once, but on Saturday he
had had enough after racing alongside the speedy
Cadenza (3’s) for a few furlongs and drifted to the
rear again. Cadenza entered the straight with a
good lead and lasted long enough to beat the
fast-finishing Royal Attendant by a neck, with
Valais Queen a poor third. Royal Attendant is a
three-year-old Linacre gelding from Newcastle and
is a decent sort. Lucy Thrice (10’s), a mean-looking
little bay mare by Thrice—Glenluce, furnished a sur-
prise in the first division of the Novice Handicap by
dancing away from Coello, The AVhite Diamond,
AVhizbro and a dozen others, and winning, pulling up,
by 10 lengths. She is a half-sister to that good
stayer King of the Forest, and her performance speaks
well for Pigeon Pie, who beat her at Canterbury
Park. The £lOOO City Tattersall’s Handicap, 10
furlongs, was a very rough race. Hit and The Wild
Goose, who was ridden by Farthing, were joint
favorites at s’s, and the latter, getting a clear run
from the half-mile post, whereas Hit, Triplex and
others met with interference, won by a length from
Solidify, who came late on the scene and finished
wide out ; Strongbow was a close third and Dainty
Davie an even closer fourth. Balbus led the other
five, and may be equal to another Villiers Stakes
if the handicapper is not too hard on him. Another
Villiers possibility was indicated in the Welter, in
which the English horse Undaunted, who had been
doing excellent track work and failing to reproduce
it when backed, galloped kindly for an apprentice
jockey and defeated Narrogin (4’s) and Royal
Dighton handily, after leading most of the way. A
pot of money was dropped on Stony (5 to 2), who
has been very expensive to his connections this season.
* * * *
“King Cotton”: With a proper sort of
tote you can sometimes back every horse in a race
and show a profit. A Brisbane punter who tried
it (on a XOs. basis) on the last day of the Exhibi-
tion meeting won on four races out of eight.
Early in the day he was well ahead, but a couple
of favorites skimmed off the profits, and he finished
up exactly square. However, he had the rare
satisfaction of backing every winner.
* * * *
“Itunnymede”: “Governor” Balsef, a
jockey who recently died in the Maitland (N.S.W.)
district, once had three winning rides in an after-
noon, all on the same horse, Haut Special. In the
third race Haut Special humped lfrst. 71b., and
Balser had to carry half of that mountain in leads.
He did it by wearing an overcoat with huge pockets
to hold the necessary deadweight.
* * * *
Paul Demsky is iiussian-born, but grew
up in Australia, his father, a political refugee, having
brought him from Vladivostock a good many years
ago. Moreover, Paul is white, both in skin and
character, so the applause when he outed the melli-
flously-named Mardlaman, Mariano Adriano, at the
Rushcutter Bay Stadium on Saturday night was a
genuine manifestation of glee and pride of color.
Jack Joseph had shown the previous Saturday night
that Adriano is amenable to reason —a reasonably
hard punch—and Demsky proved it beyond dispute.
Paul was hit hard and often, but landed more
frequently and with greater force. He was well
ahead on points at the end of the 18th, when
Adriano was all but punched out, reeling and
groggy. A succession of well-timed straight lefts
and rights put the Filipino to the canvas for nine
in the 19th. In a tremendously exciting 20th, after
Paul had been floored for nine, he retaliated so
vigorously that Mariano was flattened out for the
full count, just before the conclusion of the three
minutes. It was a sensational ending to an exciting
contest. Weights were 9st. 91b. each.
* * -* »
Billy Grime had his work cut out to retain
his title of lightweight champion against Bert Mc-
Carthy at Melbourne Stadium on Caulfield Cup
night. The fight went the full 20 rounds. Grime
getting the decision on points, though a majority vote
would have been overwhelmingly in favor of a draw.
Weights were announced as Grime 9st. 251 b., and
McCarthy 9st. 7ilb. ; but the other man’s extra
poundage did not seriously trouble Grime, with his
tip-and-run methods; he showed all his usual clever-
ness and skill in evasion. McCarthy, a stylish boxer
at his best, had the sympathy of the crowd, and
justified his claim to have regained his old form —*
which he should never have lost had he devoted
sufficient attention to training. It was a bright and
interesting exhibition by two clever lads, but as it
was merely for an Australian championship, with no
murky alien taking part, the attendance left a lot
to be desired.

Batsmen are having the time of their lives
in Sydney premiership cricket. Young players
Albert Scanes (Petersham), A. Hall (Cumberland),
E. Williams (Marrickville), AY. F. Brown (North
Sydney) and H. Phillips (Gordon) have already
helped themselves to a lot of runs. But no one
is showing better form with the willow than Charlie
Macartney, now in his 40th year, who has got over
the nerve- trouble that laid him aside last season.
For Gordon v. St. George Charlie made a sparkling
165 in 132 minutes. Among the bowlers, Jack
Gregory, Macartney, Everett, Asher and colts B. G.
Long (he got 6 for 28 for AVestern Suburbs v.
Gordon and 6 for 54 v. Waverley) and R. McNamee
distinguished themselves. The N.S.W. selection com-
mittee has picked 22 players to practise for the
big matches. Ten are internationals and all but four
have figured in Sheffield Shield contests. The bowlers
are Gregory and Everett (fast), McNamee, Hooker,
Kelleway and Morrissey (medium), and Asher, Mailey
and Macartney (slow).

Cricket in Adelaide this season is the
stronger by C. E. Pellew and his brother Lance,
back from up-country, where one has been farming
and the other practising law. Also, fast-bowler
Scott and a brother of
Jack Gregory have
arrived from Sydney.
But there was a strong
XI at. the end of last
summer without
reckoning on any of
these; Grimmett and
the two Richardsons,
Rymill and Pritchard,
who impressed both
Gilligan and Sutcliffe,
Murray and Rundell,
with Gunn and Bart-
lett, promising youn-
ger men with the bat,
and Wall and Palmer
with the ball. S.A.
talks confidently about
having a say in Shef-
field Shield matters.
G. PALMER, an
Adelaide bowler
who did well
against the Eng-
lishmen, and
began the season
by taking 5
wickets for 73.
Grimmett is a
club-mate.
“Gobble”: Victoria now lacks medium-
pace bowlers versatile in attack and astute in taking
advantage of batsmen’s weaknesses. The stock pair,
Rvder and Liddicutt, are without that variety of
method which bamboozles great batsmen; Don Blackie
alone, with his length, finger-spin, swerve, variation
of pace and ability to flight the ball, keeps alive the
old tradition. At 40, however, he cannot be regarded
as the hope of his State. Ebeling (Melbourne) and
Gamble (Ilawthorn-E. Melbourne) are coming on.
though by no means top-notchers yet. There is no
lack of slow bowlers and men w'ho can google a
bit. Tarrant, now with Fitzroy, is nearly as good
as he was with Middlesex. Rayson, of Hawthorn-E.
Melbourne, though no Grimmett, will take Hartkopf’s
place. But the majority of Vic.’s “bosies” are not
'real bowlers; they merely give batsmen opportuni-
ties of getting themselves out.
* * * *
“11. Hardupp” : Sotty went to the foot-
ball final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, but,
drooping on his feet with the weight of the beer
he had drunk, became so awkward to handle in the
dense crowd that his friends decided to let the game
go on without him. They laboriously escorted him
across to the Richmond ground to watch the cricket.
Scotty promptly went to sleei>, and his snores punctu-
ated the dull music of bat striking ball. A burst
of applause woke him up and he gaped groggily at
the game being played before his eyes. “Goo’ Lord!”
he gurgled, “musht ’a been ’shleep f’ a week!
’Was washin’ a footba’ matesh when I wen’ to’ shleep,
and wake up to shee ’em playin’ cricketsh! Holy
Moshes!” His friends declined to enlighten him as
to how it happener, and Sotty is still going about
obsessed by a Rip Van Winkle feeling.
* * * *
“II. M.”: Billy Bruce (B. 24/9/’25)
played his first Test match at Melbourne on New
Year’s Day, 1885. Oddly enough, he was picked
more for his bowling than his batting, and he sur-
prised the critics by knocking up 45 (out of 126)
in the Australians’ second innings. He bagged three
English wickets for 88. In the return match at
Melbourne, Bruce made 15 and 35 (top score), and
got 3 for 99; George Giffen, Spofforth, Trumble and
Garrett were others in the XI. In later years,
when he had developed into a polished bat, he
scored in Test matches 57 and 40, 15 and
72 (top), 5 and 37 (top), 23, 10 and 22, 68 (top),
and 36, 4 and 54, 11 and 80, 15. 22 and 11. In
all, 702 runs averaging 29.25, while he took a dozen
wickets averaging 36.66. Bruce got one century for
Victoria in Sheffield Shield matches —128 v. N.S.W.
at Melbourne in 1892. That was a delightful innings;
in fact, Bruce at his top was the most attractive
left-hander, though not the most successful, that
Australia has seen.
* * * *
“Oxmead” : A. W. Carr, the Notts county
captain, who, if he retains this year’s form, will
almost certainly lead England in the next series of
Tests, is 31 years of age, and a public-school boy
(Sherborne) but not a University man. He has the
reputation of being the hardest-hitting batsman big
cricket has seen of late years—the sort for whom
the field always spreads out in anticipatory mood,
and he finished a consistently successful county season
by making 101 against the Players at Scarborough.
Fender, of Surrey, might be a more strategical skipper
and is a batsman and bowler, too, but outside the
pair, there doesn’t seem much choice for England,
which is badly in need of a more invigorating captain
than the hard-working but stodgy Douglas and the
lively but feeble Gilligan. Tennyson, who came
between the pair as a leader in the later Tests of
1921, was more stimulating than either, but he is
on the down-grade nowadays. It is a little curious
that Notts, the home of defensive cricket and stolid
stonewallers, should have produced one of the most
nonchant smiters of sixes since Jessop was in
his heyday.
* * * *
“Tren” : Warwick Armstrong (B. S/10/’2_r>)
went after the position of Vic. selector of Australian
teams and seemed sure to get it when he led on the
first count from E. E. Bean and Jack Ryder, who
were level. His appointment would have severely
wounded the dignity of the Victorian Cricket Associa-
tion, so Bean, who had acted as selector for 11 years,
sacrificed his ambition, and retired in favor of Ryder,
who got the job. Ryder it was who, when acting as
selector during Bean’s absence in Maoriland, virtually
got Grimmett his chance in the Australian XI, with
memorable results.
* * * *
Technical professionalism in football has
suddenly become an acute question in Adelaide, owing
to the action of the Sturt club in announcing a
cash bonus for players instead of the customary
“trip” to another State, for which some of them
could not spare the time. Vic Richardson, the
international cricketer and recent S.A. football
captain, at once announced that he would sever his
connection wdth the club if it were done. The
League is to sit formally on the matter, but most
of the clubs, if they haven’t got rid of their surplus
in a trip, seem to favor distribution. (The idea
of not splashing it all, but keeping a nest-egg for
possible bad times, does not seem to occur to any-
body.) The cash-payment party claims that it is
absurd to call a man a professional footballer if he
makes his living by hard graft at something else
all the week. Also it points out the really large
sums paid, without reproach, to successful cricketers.
# * * *
Harry Jones, of North Sydney, pocketed
the £lOO hung up for the N.S.W. King’s Prize. He
shot very consistently on the wind-swept Liverpool
range, and finished with a clinking 49 (out of 50)
at 900yds. His aggregate was 329. Jones, though
44, hasn’t been long in the game—incidentally, most
of the competitors were middle-aged. J. H. Williams
(Victoria) w'as the unlucky shooter at the meeting ;
only two points behind Jones in the King’s, he was
second to J. Oadden (Brisbane Railways) for the
Longfield Aggregate. Still he collected £65 in
prize-money, Cadden’s share being £5O. Miss Snod-
grass, of Rockhampton (Q.), did the best of the
three ladies at the mounds, and put up 296 in the
King’s. She looked a possible winner at one stage,
but the boisterous conditions shattered her hopes and
those of many other competitors.
* * * *
“Adelaide”: Melbourne is not the only city
that takes table tennis seriously (B. 13/8/’25). In
Adelaide, teams from such institutions as the A.M.P.,
Elder, Smith, the Tramways Trust atid such bodies
play regular matches. Lots of old football, lacrosse
and tennis experts take part, but the younger men
don’t disdain the sport; in fact, the championship
is held by the youthful Geoff Roberts, son of A. J.
and brother of “King” Roberts, b«ith prominent in
the lawn variety of the game. '
THE STONEWALLER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Seconding a notice cf motion, at Monday night’s
meeting of the N.S.W. Cricket Association, that
Sheffield Shield matches should be limited to four
days, J. M. Taylor said the change would brighten
the game and might do away with the stonewaller.”
The stands are packed; the crowded hill
A mass of epicures becomes
Who want their cricket full of thrill,
A pudding packed with peel and plums;
They cannot stand at any price
The chap who sits upon the splice.
They greet with roars the heav’ns that rive
The wristy cut, the dexterous glance,
The clean and open-shouldered drive,
But view with moody sufferance
Him whom no bowler can entice
From sitting steady on the splice.
The sweet champagne that Trumper gave,
The stingo from a Chapman’s bat,
Such is the brand or brew they crave,
But oh! how thin the beer and flat—
They pull wry faces in a trice—
When someone sits upon the splice.
The men who “use the handle long,”
Whose bangs and smashes find the chains,
These are the idols of the throng
AVhich chafes and frets and often deigns
To hurl ironical advice
At him who site upon the splice.
The game grows dull and drab, they say.
Cut short must be the match’s span
To sprag the wheels of those who play
Like Barlow did —or Bannerman.
The gate demands the sacrifice
Of those who roost upon the splice.
Be warned! They seek to pass you out,
Whose bats resemble walls of stone —
And though I have a passing doubt
If four-day games will do it, I own—
Be warned and let the threat suffice,
All you who sit upon the splice!

THE INKY WAY.
Among the Inky-way men who are trying their
luck at tlie Federal elections is L. L. Batten, who is
the selected Labor candidate for Kooyong, in oppo-
sition to Latham, K.C. Batten is the industrial
reporter for the Melbourne Herald, and one of the
stormy petrels of the A.J.A.
“The Traveller”: If a census of Albion printing
presses is required, please include the one at the
Albion printing office, Coleraine (Yic.). It is probable
that this paper got its name from the old press.
At any rate, the present proprietor, F. W. Punshon.
does not know of any namesake of his paper in
Australia. The old Albion press is still iised at
jobbing work, though the newspaper is printed on
a more modern machine, set up alongside its ancient
little brother.
“Keppel”; ,T. Dobbs and Harry Bachelor have put
in a century’s service between them with the Rock-
hampton (C.Q.) Morning Bulletin. Dobbs can
look back on nearly 55 years in the one job, and
Bachelor, who retired recently on his seventieth
birthday, on 45. Born in Kent, Bachelor landed in
Brisbane in 1870, and was cane-cutting and copper-
mining before he took up his old trade of printing
again. He was with the Peak Downs Telegram be-
fore he came to the Morning Bulletin.
“Lomara”: Giving as his reason that he may win
the Ballarat seat in the Federal election and so
will have to move thither, Tommy Rvan. ex-railway-
man, ex-M.L.A. and ex-much else, is selling out of
the Essendon Gazette, one of Melbourne’s chief
suburban weeklies. For years in the possession of
the Motts, long associated with Australian journalism
in Melbourne and Albury, the Gazette was lately
largely a propagandist organ for Ryan. But propa-
ganda was of no avail against an antagonist like
Maurice Blackburn, so Tommy is pulling out.
“Louden”: Here’s a good news-man lost. The
Lome (Vic.) Progress Association thrice sought to
hold its annual meeting, and each time the attend-
ance was nil or thereabouts. Then the local school-
master took a hand. The date of the meeting and a
rousing appeal to Lome’s adult population to roll up
was written on the blackboard, and the children had
to copy it in their homework-books and read
it to their parents. This had the desired effect;
60 people responded and showed enthusiasm’, too, by
subscribing £4O for the purchase of a horse-drawn
ambulance for the district.
“The Deacon”: Although Bishop Cleary, of Auck-
land (M.L.), is getting on in years and has a
large diocese of whites and Maoris in his keeping,
he still finds time to tread the Inky Way. Just
now he is editor of the Maoriland R.C. organ, the
Month. Prior to becoming Bishop of Auckland in
1910 ho was the live-wire editor of the Tablet, the
official R.C. organ of the Shivery Isles. His health
is far from good, and for some years he has had
the Maorilander Dr. James Liston, who was once
tried for High Treason, as coadjutor. Several near
relatives of Dr. Cleary live in the Grafton district
(N.S.W.).
“H. 0.8.”; I rubbed my eyes when I read in the
S. M. Herald (3/10/’25) a leader on “the virtues
of slang,” warmly commending the expressiveness
of phrases and words such as “going west,” “cushy”
and “blimp” and calling attention to the richness of
metaphor in the diagnosis of “rats in his belfry!”
Yet you may search the columns of the Herald in
vain for the mildest colloquialism; no reporter
would dare to venture on one. It reminds me that
a certain venerable editor of a Sydney paper was
shocked one day to read in a fashion note that a
lady had worn “nigger” brown. He altered the
word to “negro.”
“Miro”: A M.L. journalist who has wandered far
from his original profession is Donald Murray, in-
ventor of the Murray Multiplex printing telegraph
system. He is a son of a one-time general manager
of the Bank of N.Z. For some years he was a
young reporter on the Auckland Weekly News,
where he hit up a reputation for hard work and a
determination never to be baulked in an undertaking.
Later he was on the S. M. Herald and led the staff
which looked after the Federal Convention for that
paper. Recently he sold his telegraph patents to an
English firm for £30,000, after strenuous years of
work on his invention,
“Fed Up”: Can’t something be done for the free-
lance? My worst example is the man who offers a
writer a guinea per thousand words for a story
after he has published it. For a 450-line story I
put in an account for £4 10s. the other day, but
the editor of a well-known monthly refused to pay
more than two guineas. I had another story in a
Sydney publication, and had to call 11 times before
I received my small cheque. Because I insisted on
being paid then, the proprietor sent me back two
stories lie had accepted (but not paid for) long
before. Even when I have agreed to accept a
guinea a thousand words I’ve had my yarn paid
for as 2000 words when it was 2900. Mention the
A.J.A. and award rates to these fellows and they
boycott you for all time. What can we do?
“Herodot”: “G. 8.,” writing of John Norton and
his Napoleonic craze (B. 8/10/’25), did not treat the
matter with the seriousness that Norton did. John
accumulated an enormous quantity of material relat-
ing to his idol, amongst it many genuine relics, and
he had a valuable library of books dealing with the
Corsican. Anything remotely concerning Napoleon
was sure to arouse his interest. Once during a trip
of Norton’s to Paris some impecunious art students
learned of his devouring passion. In the possession of
one of them was an old full-length painting of the
Emperor standing in characteristic attitude. This
was dug out, and after Norton’s features had been
carefully scrutinised, the face in the picture was
altered so that the portrait w'as of him rather than of
Napoleon. When the paint had dried Norton was
induced to look at it, and, after giving an astonished
gasp at the resemblance to himself, he bought it for
about 300 times its value. Years afterwards he learned
of the trick, and for some time the proprietor of
Truth was an extremely angry man.
“T.P.”: A recent reference to Governor Brassey
forking out hard cash to Chief Justice Madden whilst
the latter was acting as Lieutenant-Governor recalls
that a Melbourne Herald reporter was responsible
for the publicity the matter received. Stormy
Winter, the manager in those days, sent him to ask
why Brassey had’ laid up the Sunbeam in Sydney
for repairs when Melbourne could do the needful
to the yacht. His Ex. turned a cold eye on the
reporter—unlike Hopetoun, who always received press-
men heartily, and hospitably—and grumbled that he
was money out of pocket by his job, seeing that
he had to pay Madden when the latter acted as
locum, tenens. The reporter revenged himself for the
discourteous reception by cross-heading the item.
Madden frothed and Brassey pleaded the chat was
private. His aide-de-camp rang up Winter, and
things might have gone hard for the pressman had
not the gilded objector made some remark anent
the Herald's lack of manners. At that Winter told
him to go to the devil, and rang off. Then the
fun began.
“Theodoric”: After attending the Imperial Press
Conference I am constrained to ask: What is the
Press —a literary craft or a trade? Cable rates,
tariffs where they affected the material of newspaper
production, paper manufacture, copyright as it affected
proprietaries and similar subjects which bore on
the commercial side of newspaperdom were discussed;
delegates, as representatives of parts of the Empire,
were commendably loquacious on Imperial matters,
which mean little but read well; but hardly a word
was said about the literature of journalism. Nobody
cared apparently whether papers were written well
or ill; passion for the King’s Empire did not extend
to the King’s English, nor did anyone want, to bind
together the scattered links of Empire by means of
an exchange of journalists at proprietors’ expense or
a travelling scholarshio for young reporters. Authors’
copyright aroused no fury of debate, nor did anyone
table a self-denying ordinance against the Five-
Pound Serial or the contribution never paid for.
Evidently the Empire and Press proprietaries are one,
leaving pressmen to the care of that God who helps
those who help themselves.

In Galsworthy’s “Old English” Gregan
McMahon and the Sydney Repertorians won
the goodwill of the Palace audience on Satur-
day night. The play revolves around a sur-
vival of the early Victorians —a hard drinker,
hard fighter, and, although when the play
opens almost completely paralysed and bank-
rupt, hard business man still. Indeed it is
his very acuteness that delivers him into
his enemy’s hands. Bankrupt, and anxious
to make a settlement on the grandchildren
he cannot own, he devises quite a modern bit
of graft by which as director of a shipping
company he pushes through the sale of four
ships for an old acquaintance, Joe Pillin
(Harold Watch), on condition that £6OOO
of the sale money is settled by Pillin on the
two youngsters he loves, Phyllis (Eileen Kay
Souper) and Jock Larne. Gregan McMahon
was, of course, Old English, and therefore
nearly the whole play. He has probably
never done more telling work than in the
portrayal of the wily, ruthless and gentle-
manly old reprobate. In the scenes where
he faces his creditors, and pushes the pur-
chase of the ships on the shareholders of his
company, the acting Avas so realistic that the
old man’s determined rallying of his
failing powers could be felt by the lookers-
on. Mrs. Herrick Knowles, who under her
old name of Lily Titheradge was the irre-
sponsible, amusing and brainless Rosamund
Larne, acted brilliantly, and by an inflec-
tion of her tone and a wave of the hand
could shiver the gravity of the audience into
a thousand prisms of laughter. Two other
members of the cast fitted into their parts
as into their own skins —they were Albert
Collins as Ventnor, an irate debtor of the old
stoic’s; and Pearl Appleton as Molly, the
maid. Miss Appleton’s accent was perfect,
and her intonation a joy to the ear. Eleanor
Ross, usually so good, was not at that level
on Saturday as the shrewish spinster daugh-
ter. There were many minor characters,
none of them out of the picture.

Winter has fled and Spring is on the hop,
And gay in summer helmet strides the cop;
But still Dot Brunton lingers longer in
“The Music-Box Revue” at Sydney Op.

Clara Butt and Kennerley Rumford ceased
singing “The Keys of Heaven” to Sydney
audiences yesterday. There have been nine
concerts altogether instead of the four origi-
nally planned. The contralto has repeated
Avith great tonal beauty Beethoven’s “Crea-
tion’s Hymn,” “Where the Mind is Without
Pear,” Schubert’s “Death and the Maiden”
and “The Wanderer” and Novello’s Page’s
“Road Song.” With Kennerley Rumford
it is clearly a case of art is long. When he
hasn’t a note left in his voice, he’ll still be
one of the most enjoyable of English song-
makers. His “To Anthea” on Saturday night
caught and reflected the charm of both poem
and music.

Herschel Henlere, “the Paderewski of
vaudeville” —aijd it’s not a bad title either —
is again bringing freshness to the Sydney
Tivoli programme. There is not a vestige
of moss about his thoroughly artistic turn —
artistic even though he can’t dawdle seri-
ously over a tender passage for more than
a minute. The rest of the programme is
unchanged.
* * * *
Sydney Fullers’ has temporarily run out
of conjurers, acrobats and such-like enter-
tainers, and there is a glut of performers
at the Castlereagh-street emporium who em-
ploy their tongues in patter and song. Carl-
ton and Roslyn present a soulful study of a
pair of doves cooing of moonlight and roses;
Rene Dixon, an Australian maiden, scores
with a sweet voice and dainty artistry in
dances that please; a robust jester is Harry
Taft, from overseas, whose haversack is well
stocked with hearty burlesque turns, and
whose grin wins him laughs before he starts;
Sam Stern keeps to Yiddish and Italian
mimicry, and the Gayle Wyer revue co. is
heard in a jingle of music and revelry.
At Sydney Lyceum, Old Bill, Captain
Bairnsfather’s walrus-moustached progeny,
is looking backwards at English history.
The retrospective glimpses include William
the Conq., King John, Shakspeare and
Queen Elizabeth, and these exalted person-
ages appear in all sorts of ludicrous roles
and commit countless anachronisms to the
dismay of humorless pedants. The inn
which caters for ladies contemplating divorce
in Reno, U.S.A., and which was made
famous by John D. O’Hara in “Lightning,”
is now in the movies, and is doing a roaring
trade at Hoyt’s. “Speed,” an indictment of
jazz-mad flappers, is also at Hoyt’s. Mary
Bickford is the Crystal Palace’s “Little
Annie Rooney,” and Doug. Fairbanks is the
Prince Edward’s “Thief of Bagdad.”

An audience which laughed till its tonsils
were sore filled the Melbourne Athenaeum on
Saturday night to greet the Hoffman farce,
“(Jive and Take,” in which E. J. Carroll has
struck another winner. As the bones on
which to hang its humor the farce has a
good story. John Bauer, after 30 years of
struggle, has built up a fruit-canning busi-
ness, but is nipped financially in a struggle
with a Trust, in the midst of which his son,
who has picked up socialistic ideas at a
university, returns to organise the workers,
including his “Old Reliable” foreman and
friend Albert Kruger, the idea being to de-
mand an “Industrial Democracy” which will
give them a share of control and of profits.
Although kicking hard, Bauer agrees to give
the arrangement a month’s trial, partly be-
cause he is broken-hearted to find his son
against him, and partly because he despe-
rately wants to avoid a strike which will
give the Trust a victory. Under a system
of control in which the factory whistle is
blowing every few minutes for a “rest
period” or a meeting of the “industrial con-
gress,” a crisis arrives in the business; but,
ultimately, after a series of situations which
are dramatic enough but always have laugh-
ter in their tail, a millionaire idealist, who
has escaped from a lunatic asylum, helps the
story to a satisfactory conclusion, with
sanity and prosperity once more prevailing
at the works, and a matrimonial event in the
offing.
* * * *
Harry Green gave a strong, sincere repre-
sentation of the shrewd, hardworking John
Bauer; the sorrows of the factory boss at the
defection of his son and of his foreman and
friend Kruger, and the threatened smash of
the business which had been his life-job, lost
no force through his remarks being aureoled
with rich humor. It was an artistically-fine
performance. And in his own way Roy Rene
was not much less successful as Kruger. As
he mentioned after curtain-fall in a shy, em-

barrassed speech, Rene had never played a
set part before. But there is no doubt about
his rank as a natural comedian. He and
Harry Green made a curious and interesting
contrast in styles. Jack Bauer, the theoris-
ing son of the factory boss, was well treated
by Lou Vernon; Edwin Lester was a not
altogether incredible bank manager, Daniel
Drum —the nearest approach to a villain the
farce contains —and Edward de Tisne put
vigor and good perception into the part of
Thomas Craig, the idealistic millionaire, who
had been locked up as a lunatic by relatives
who don’t want to see his money spent on his
dreams. The only woman in the cast was
the puckish Lorna Helms, who, although she
might not be able to give the proper weight
to such a part in a “straight” play, was
satisfactory as Marion Kruger, showing that
she does not need a character study to make
a success. There has not been so much
laughter in any one spot in Melbourne for
months and months.

PRINCESS.

There is ingenious construction in Isabel
Handley’s “The Mandarin Coat,” which the
Repertory Players produced at the Melbourne
Playhouse last week; a series of well-worked
surprises, connected by neat dialogue, sus-
tain interest until very near the end. The
worst blemish occurs there; the “washing-
up” is slightlj* too prolonged. The purchase
out of her housekeeping money (hoping for
a reimbursement from her husband) of the
mandarin coat by the extravagant Sheila
Caldwell leads to a mesh of complications in
which Sheila’s fear of admitting her extra-
vagance (the price was a hundred guineas),
Caldwell’s bad financial position and his
jealousy of Eric Lister, who is constantly
at the Caldwell flat in order to meet Madge
Torrance, and the desire of Sam Goon to
recover the garment, which had been sold
by an assistant * against his wishes, are in-
volved. Humor is obtained from the cheerful
lying of the Caldwell couple, and a highly
dramatic situation, which has the audience
completely mystified, finishes the second act.
The third, of course, clears up the situation
with the arrest of Sam Goon as an opium
smuggler and the seizure of the mandarin
coat —a comparatively worthless garment —■
in the sleeves of which there is an opium
“plant.” The players did well, the mainstays
being Elizabeth Apperly, very effective as
Sheila Caldwell; Stanley Smith, who over-
came the difficulties of the part of the China-
man, Sam Goon; Robert Guthrie, the pom-
pous butler, Hawkes; and Russel Gourlay,
Norman Simpson and Olive Norman as
Stephen Caldwell, Eric Lister and Madge
Torrance. But the minor parts were well
filled, too. Isabel Handley herself produced
the show, and on the first night gave a bash-
ful acknowledgment of the applause of the
audience.

The Repertory Players are to stage Drink-
water’s “Abraham Lincoln” on November 3
• —Cup night.
** * *
“Fair and Warmer,” which came to Mel-
bourne King’s on Saturday night, was not
an Australian success some years ago when
Percy Marmont, now a screen star, was in
the company. But we have changed since
then ; and, besides, Nellie Bramley is prov-
ing herself a flexible-voiced comedienne, able
to carry her audience with her in all she
does. Too many explanations are needed to
get the fun moving; but once the plot is
going it goes wuth reckless speed. Apart
from Miss Bramley’s good work and that of
Billy Bartlett, the soberside banker (Arthur
Cornell), the loudest hosanna is earned by
Beryl Barraclough as a sophisticated maid
with a knowledge of the best pick-me-ups for
people who have been experiencing a night
before and want relief from the morning
after. George Hewlett, the husband with
the liking for card parties and the habit' of
using Masonry as an excuse for getting to
them, is inclined to force his effects too
much, and his laugh is more artificial than
infectious; but the fault is not great.
** * *
A note of warning has been issued to those
Melbourne people (if there are any) who
have not seen “No, No, Nanette.” The “last
weeks” are announced at the New Princess.
But weeks proclaimed like that about a
bright show like this often do last.
There is no indication yet that "t\ ild-
ffower” needs to seek any soil but that of
Ilis Majesty’s in Melbourne.

Frank Napoleon Harvey will get his Royal
Divorce for the last time as far as the Mel-
bourne Royal is concerned to-night. The
house is wanted for Gladys Monerieff, who
enters as “The Street Singer” on Saturday.

From the box-office point of view,
“Charley’s Aunt” so well fills the bill at the
New Palace (Melb.) that the entrance of
“The Private Secretary” is delayed for an-
other week at least. But the performance
has degenerated from simple farce-comedy
to roaring farce. The bogus lady from
Brazil, even if she is a gentleman, should
behave in a manner that would give other
characters a reasonable excuse for treating
her as a lady.
** * *
Melbourne paid homage to Maggie Moore
with a house which packed His Majesty’s
and alternated between laughter and tears.
A diversified programme was provided, and
the audience was prepared to enjoy every
item. It heard Maggie Moore herself recite
“The Hero” and “Goodbye, John; Goodbye,
Jim,” and cascaded its approval from all
parts of the theatre. Leaving Maggie out of the
reckoning, a nigger-minstrel first half, made
up of 27 ancient and modern performers and
some notable citizens, was the most popular
item, the old jokes that were dug up from
their graves, and the joke of some of the
people being there at all, being equally
enjoyed by the audience. Cricketer Warwick
Armstrong, -whose rotundity continues to
develop, was the chief butt. He and Andrew
Higginson -were interlocutors, and Charlie
Pope and Will Whitburn were in the circle.
Herschel Henlere, the comedian of the piano,
showed how Liszt, Chopin, Strauss and
others would have interpreted a modern
comic song—work clever as well as amusing
•—and sketches and songs made up a rich
and festive entertainment, -which finished off
in thunders of applause when the announce-
ment was made that Maggie would benefit to
the extent of something over £l4OO. And
then the dear lady, struggling with emotion,
made her speech. It was a memorable after-
noon and a worthy tribute.

The Melbourne Bijou last Saturday de-
parted from its recent course of mixed vaude-
ville by staging the Optimists Revue Co. for
the second half. About the Optimists this
candid critic is a pessimist. There are some
bright enough people in the show, but the
materia] they have is poor, and there is sug-
gestiveness in one of the “scenes” Avhicli
makes its poor humor poorer still. Nell
Fleming, that vivacious red-headed artist,
does her best to put life into the show; but
it has to carry too many well-meaning duds,
and that along with the poor matter is too
much. In the first part Estelle Rose cre-
ates a much better impression than she did
at first; her manner of telling amusing yarns
is top-class; and Maxwell Carew, who has
one of the quaintest noses ever produced in
vaudeville, is entertaining.

Last Thursday Melbourne Assembly Hall
heard the voice of Myrtle Skinner. It has
beautiful tone and fair volume, and is worth
polishing. Its owner managed to sustain
the climax of the “Jewel Song” praise-
worthily, and that is a pretty severe test.
Assistance was lent by violinist Cecil Parkes
and baritone J. Alexander Browne.
** * *
The Lee White co. is scattered amongst
the picture-shows and elsewhere, and that
best part of it which is Lee White herself is
filling the interval with hilarity at Mel-
bourne Majestic. The picture programme
makes a feature of a Sheikish film. “A Cafe
in Cairo,” in which a white girl-orphan,
brought up by a desert Sheik, meets an Eng-
lish secret-service man, and shares a hatful
of startling adventures with him. At Hoyt’s
De Luxe Australia’s own “Snowy” Baker, as
an American Army officer in “The Sword of
Valor,” is given the opportunity to do some
athletic “stunts” in rescuing the daughter
of an impoverished grandee from a marriage
with a wealthy Eurasian. The other main
picture, “A Woman’s Faith,” lives through
the cold of Northern Canada.

Wirths’ Circus opened at the Olympia
(Melb.) on Saturday—a giddy conglomera-
tion of horse acts, performing animals and
thrills on trapezes, making its perennial
appeal to the small boy and his sister, and
the big boys who were the small boys of one
or two generations ago. Wirths know then-
business through and through, so that act
leaps breathlessly upon act until the three
hours of thrill and sensation are finished.
Points that call for special mention in the
present show are the six splendid white
horses, Phil Wirth’s own appearance for the
last time in Melbourne in an act, the per-
forming seals and monkeys, the control that
the wild-animal trainer has over his lions,
and the fine horsemanship of Alf Clarke —a

conglomeration of wonders which every real
boy in Melbourne will want to hurry to see,
as the show is staying only three weeks.
** * *
Maurice Diamond’s Girl Show has stepped
brightly in upon the heels of Herschel Hen-
lere. That is the sum of the changes at
Melbourne Tivoli, excepting the return of the
harmonious “Big Four,” whose popularity
is unquestionable.
It is not so long ago that Melbourne was
given its first introduction to Arnold Bax.
Now he is heard everywhere; but the set-
tings he gave to a couple of old French melo-
dies sung by Miss Margery Hatchard at
her concert at the Queen’s Hall were not
particularly happy, although she did them
very prettily. Prettincss is the chief quality
of the lady’s singing; her voice lacks tone-
quality and volume, but good articulation
and a charm of manner, with an alluring
sweetness, make her pleasing to hear. She
was helped by the Melbourne String Quartet.

More Flowers of Melbourne’s Art Spring:
The coming of yet another gallery tells of an
increasing art-buying public. The Sedon, which has
opened in the Hardware Buildings, has made a good
entry with a collection of pictures by men in the
front rank and some others. The best is a Streeton
landscape, painted with the vigorous craftsmanship
that was his before he became rather too well satis-
fied with his vigorous craftsmanship. Napier Waller
has three nicely-conceived pictures in his decorative
style; one, “The Amazons” (naturally the least
good), has been purchased by the National Gallery.
Bernice Edwell, whose work in miniatures is delight-
ful, succeeds less well in oils—“ Trees in Shadow”
(No. 19) has points, but “Home on Panton Hills”
(No. 18) is crude. Harold Herbert has four water-
colors, his usual good work, which by comparison
rather lessen the value of two good things by R. W.
Sturgess. Norman Lindsay disrobes some more ladies ;
Elioth Gruner contributes two disappointments ;
M. J. McNally is still concerned with cloud effects ;
and Carl Hampel, W. W. Knox, Norman Lloyd,
Gwen Barringer, Walter Withers and Carlisle Jack-
son are amongst the other Australian contributors.
Specially kept out of this general mention are Nora
Gurdon, who gives a very fine spaciousness to
“Through the Trees” and “The Valley from Mt.
Dandenong” ; R. Warner, who makes a good thing
of an unambitious “At Wesley Vale, Tasmania,” and
a poor smudge of an ambitious “Fog in the Valley,
Warrandyte”; and J. Ansell, whose “Landscape,
Narrabeen,” has attractive qualities.
Two improving artists from whom much better
may be expected after more study, C. Orme and
H. L. Fern, have a show at the Athenaeum Hall which
runs to 91 water-colors and four pencil sketches—
Cl of the water-colors by Fern. C. Orme is in-
clined to impressionism in color, and frequently
produces smudgy effects ; but “Evening Glow, Lome”
(No. 1), and “The Hilltop” (No. 9) are free from
his major sins, and there is good work on silk,
notably “Melbourne” (No. 22). Fern’s work is more
careful; but lie seems to have decided that Nature
has wrong ideas about trees ; and he is inclined to
make his color muddy. “On the Erskine, Lome”
(No. 50), is neatly done, and “Wet Evening” (No.
81), painted on linen, is a presentable home deco-
ration.
When a young man at the age of 22 decides to
be an artist, undertakes to teach himself, and 18
months later holds an exhibition, some nightmares
are to be expected. And L. G. D’Arcy, who is at
the Decoration Gallery with no less than 40 pictures,
doesn’t disappoint you. In just a: few of the 40
the gleam of an artistic outlook shows through the
crudity of the work, and there is some impression
of space and distance; but most of the others will
be deeply regretted when the young man, having
something to say, learns how to say it.
There is an attractive exhibit at Robertson and
Mullens’ of the work of Mrs. W. Bothroyd in what
she calls Grannette Pottery Ware. A green jade
Amphora, decorated with blood-red flamingoes, and
a water-jar in Naples yellow, with a landscape
Painted by Miss Leila Bothroyd, are two of the most
striking.
Moseovitch ended his Adelaide season with
two or three renderings of his keen virile
and comparatively youthful Shylock. Gladys
Moncrieff has now come back, and is rushing
through a week of “Sybil” and “Maid of the
Mountains.” In pictures Wondergraph is
startling (and occasionally horrible) in
Victor Hugo’s “Notre Dame” with varia-
tions. Nicely contrasted are West’s dog-
and-snow Far North drama, and the York
with Leatrice Joy (always delightful) in
a Dressmaker from Paris; and the Pav.
again is entirely different with a “Wizard of
Oz.” At the Prince of Wales the Anderson
co. has wisely returned from English melo-
drama to Australian, the good old “Squat-
ter's Daughter.”
From an Adelaide critic:—
Gladys Owen (Sydney) has an exhibition of water-
colors in the Dunster Gallery. She works on the
large scale, covering much surface with bold strokes;
and atmosphere plays a great part in her work.
Once or twice she recalls Blamire Young, and a
Sydney Harbor seems to be deliberately Turneresque;
but for the most part she is boldly original. George
Cowan said grace before the show.
Poverty
Point
“D. Empson”: Owen Nares, who is a good
film actor as well as a London matinde idol,
declares that the sorry condition of the Brit-
ish film industry is largely due to the climate:
There is an appalling but unavoidable waste of
time, money and material. We have producers and
players as good as any in the world, but they and
everybody connected with film production here' are
up against the British climate. What to the
uninitiated may appear to be a perfectly clear day
may be hopelessly misty for camera purposes. Studio
scenes, it is true, are shot under arc-lamps, but
these are powerless against bad visibility. Attempts
have been made to solve the problem. During the
war the Lasky people built a studio at Islington.
FRUITS FOR THE MARRIAGE
MARKET,
“For people in the profession I think they’re
very well matched,”
“Quite so. She’s a grass-widow and he’s a
vegetarian.”
They installed a special apparatus, which cost, I
believe, about £20,000 and was supposed to be
proof against our climate. It wasn’t, and the Lasky
co. retired defeated.
Australia has the climatic advantages that
Britain lacks. Why shouldn’t the British
film people get pictures made in Australia?
The Melbourne-born Oswald Stoll is giving
the experiment a trial, using British capital
and employing an Australian producer and
British and Australian actors; but with a
fiscal understanding between the two Govern-
ments the thing might be done on a vast
scale, with profit to both countries. British
films are now on the Australian free list,
and Australian films get a one-third prefer-
ence in Britain. Unfortunately the duties
on foreign positives are only l£d. per foot
in Australia and Id. in Britain, so the con-
cessions are almost valueless. If they are
made worth while I predict. that not only
Australian and Anglo-Australian themes, but
British history and fiction, will be fashioned
into photo-plays in Australian studios-.
“Hamfat”: The Firm’s publicity mail was
on pretty safe ground ill asserting that
Frank Harvey has always yearned to appear
as Napoleon; it is true Of most actors-. And
Frank, it seems, is .as .keen a collector bf
books dealing With the Kmperor’s career as
John Norton, Who OnCe drew a comparison
between Napoleon as a conqueror of Europe
at the age of 27
and himself as edi-
tor of Truth at
about the! same
age. I was associ-
ated with an excel-
lent comedian who
had to be con-
stantly sidetracked
from the ambition
to play Nap. At
last he had his
way, and “A; Royal
Divorce” was
staged, with the
comic man giving
a painful represen-
tation of the Em-
peror. It drew
well, but the house,
which began by
treating the affair
as a joke, became
angry before the
end; and, cancelling
the second night’s
show, wc slipped
quietly out of the
town —the company
called it the re-
treat from Mos-
cow. Our comic’s
wrath was truly
Napoleonic when
he read the news-
paper reviews ;
they unanimously expressed the opinion that
his Napoleon was the funniest thing he had
done.
“S. Gumm”: After proving to its own
satisfaction:' that it wouldn’t pay to make
Australian moving-pictures, the Amalgama-
tion is going to make quite a lot of them. It
has been “encouraged by the success of
‘Painted Daughters,’ ” it says. I suspect
it has also' been “encouraged” by the Vic.
bill insisting on a specified proportion of
British and: British Dominion films being
included in programmes, by the probability
that other States will pass similar legisla-
tion, and by the possibility of the import
duty on foreign films being raised to at least
6d. per foot when the new Commonwealth
Parliament gets into its stride; but I am
not going to carp at a welcome recantation.
However, there is a danger of the Amalga-
mation imagining that Australia wants more
pictures like' “Painted Daughters.” It
doesn’t. “Painted Daughters” was a box-
oflice success less because of its intrinsic
merits, which were inconsiderable, than be-
cause the public is so hungry for Australian
pictures that it is willing, at the moment,
to temper justice with mercy; but that mood
won’t last. Australian film-producers will
have to go in for good Australian stories,
settings and actors. People will soon turn
away from cheap imitations of Hollywood
stuff and unknowns who act as if they had
St. Vitus’s dance.
“Minim” : The head of the J. C. William-
son firm, who ought to know, says that the
most popular Gilbert and Sullivan opera
with Australian audiences is “The Gondo-
liers” ; “The Mikado” is second and “Iolan-
tho” third. The new G. and S. company
will therefore give the operas in that order
when it opens here at Easter, and “The
Yeomen of the Guard,” “Pinafore,” “The
Pirates,” “Patience” and “Princess Ida” will
also be done. No mention is made of “Rud-
digore,” which would be a novelty in Aus-
tralia, though it is getting on for 39 years
since the first production at the Savoy.
“E.T.”: Australia will not have to wait
long for Frederick “Spring Cleaning” Lons-
dale’s newest comedy, “The Last of Mrs.
Cheney.” It is down for production here
soon with a cast headed by Renee Kelly,
a favorite in London in such pieces as
“Daddy Long Legs” and “Fair and Warmer.”
An even more interesting play in the same
company's kitbag is an adaptation from the
Italian called “The Mask and the Face,”
which had a vogue in England last year.
The piece has a tragic theme from which
farcical incidents arise.
“C.G.” : Percy Grainger, who made a flyihg
trip to Australia last year for family reasons*
is coming back for a concert tour under the
Tait management early next year. Grainger,
in addition to being a great pianist, is the
one Australian composer who lias made an
international reputation. In SOme Of liiS
compositions lie seems to have caught, the
sunshine ahd run it into melody, and to hear
him play them will be a rich treat-.
“Satis” i The public is learning a gobd
deal of the business relationships existing
between theatrical managements and theiif
empioye'e& Gladyis Mbnci-ieff, fdr instance,
announces that her arrangement with the
Firm gives it a. right to her services fora
further period at a salary bf fISO per week,
but that as the directors have decided not
to take up the option she. is concluding her
engagement find, leaving the country. One
can inily hiarvel at the valuation the lady
places on her services; no Australian-born
actress has ever touched such a salary as
THAT FELLOW FEELING.
MULGA MIKE: “I reckon this ’ere modern jazz music's absolutely
rotten. Give me the good old rag-time, I says.”
she mentions. But what does it matter to
the playgoer what salary a mummer is paid?
What he wants is the goods he has paid for.
These business disagreements between actors
and their bosses are becoming monotonous.
“Half-Moon”: I noticed a cosmopolitan
crowd on the Thursday Island parade and
joined it. The attraction was Frank Hur-
ley making a film —“The Pearl of the South
Seas”—for the Stoll Pictures, Ltd. He
won't run short of human material of every
breed and color in this neck of the seas.
Incidentally, Hurley found in a local publican
an ideal man for the part of a dying pearler.
Thirsty Isle may yet become the Hollywood
of Australia.
“Flaming Youth”: Nowadays, competi-
tion having forced them to put on frills,
picture-shows, even in the subbubs, are again
employing the mummer who would otherwise
be workless; and they pay him more than
he used to get for film-acting—work for the
.screen in Australia was, and still is,
wretchedly paid. For a time picture-shows
engaged actors to lecture on the fillums as
tliey developed on the screen. Probably ; it
was recognised that this was a poor com-
pliment to the fillums, and the lecturer lias
been dropped; but all sorts of vaudeville
and semi-vaudeville turns, including dramatic
Sketches, are being snapped up eagerly by
the flicker people. In fact, the mummer
who is out of work at present is one who
hasn’t the enterprise or ability to collabor-
ate with one or two others and knock
together a sketch worth presenting. There
is plenty of material to be got by digging
up curtain-raisers once in the fashion —
vastly better stuff than the performers at
present use. There is, for instance, that
little comedy gem, “A Kiss,” which the
Majeronis used to do; and 50 others might
be named.
“Mid-Channel”: “C. Ockney”(B.B/10/’25)
seems to be of the opinion that because Wil-
son Barrett created the part of Wilfred
Denver in “The Silver King” he must natu-
rally have been the best exponent. I wrote
of those who had played the part in Aus-
tralia ; if I had to place them in order of
merit I would put Scot Inglis first, Tither-
edge a close second, William Desmond third
and Julius Knight a good distance away
fourth. Barrett, when here with Lillah
McCarthy, was very good in pieces like “Man
and His Makers,” but in plays of the modern
type, where everyday clothes were worn, he
was a comparative failure. So, for that
matter, was Knight, capital as he was
in “The Sign of the Cross,” “Monsieur Beau-
caire” and “David Garrick.”

Poet-lovers, legions strong,
Singing down the charmed ages,
To you now Ive listened long,
Glowing to your noblest rages;
Heard your most impassioned song.
Images, revealing, rare,
O’er and o’er you’ve aptly painted
Of milady’s silken hair,
Skin of snow by roses tainted,
Fair and ever yet more fair.
So meticulous your tale
Of her wondrous varied graces—
Face and throat and fingers pale—
Not the last, minutest traces
May we miss who hear your wail.
Dainty elbow, ankle neat,
Warm the memories of your, storing!
Dimpled knee and bosom sweet—
Endless seems your pert exploring
From her gloried head to feet.
Eyes and nose and ears and toes,
Details still you keep reciting,
Till one swears one surely knows
Inside out from your inditing,
Every blossomed fair that blows.
Yet I find a certain lack
In your ceaseless supervising;
Frontal always your attack;
Hence, it seems, the question rising,
Judges, all in learned black,
Doubt the feat of recognising
Phyllis’s forgotten back!

S HE is independent of the ice

cleaning out, and food de-
teriorating any way. She is
saving her money on the food
bill with her Kelvinator, as well
as having plenty of real ice made
at home, ice-cream, etc., and an
ice-chest in which the clean,
cold, dry air keeps every article
for weeks or months if she
needs it.
Just as candles have given way
to electric light, so
has the ice-chest been
superseded by the
Kelvinator. In the
city, the hotel-keeper
or the restaurateur;
and in the suburbs,
the storekeeper and
the housewife; in the
country, the grazier,
the farmer and the

all need the Kelvina-

It brings not only all
the comforts of the
most up-to-date hotel,
but health as well.

Kerosene is the low-priced fuel, and when used in the
Lister” Engines makes Power very cheap.
The New Lister Patent Kerosene Vaporiser is very
simply constructed, yet it gives greatest efficiency with
remarkably low fuel consumption. It does away with all
taps and water-drip arrangements.
All old Kerosene Engine troubles are eliminated because
in the “Lister” the fuel after vaporisation in the hot
chamber mixes with cold air as it enters the cylinder, thus
forming a cool elastic mixture allowing easy compression
without “knocking.”
The “Lister” embodies many other features to give
efficiency with economy and easy working.
The cylinder head is easily and quickly removed; this
makes the cleaning of the piston, valves, etc., when
necessary a very simple matter.
IT OILS ITSELF.
The System of Lubrication fitted to the “Lister” is auto-
matic. All the bother of poking round with an oilcan
or filling and regulating sight-feed lubricators
is done away with. All that is required is to
fill the reservoir (on the side of the crankcase)
and let the Engine do the rest for the next
couple of months or so.
This system does not use a quarter of the oil
necessary for sight-feed lubricators, and, more-
over, it is obviously impossible to under-
lubricate or over-lubricate while there is oil in
the reservoir.

Procrastination is the Thief of Profit
extraordinary, but lovable, indifference of the average Australian
was never better exemplified than in connection with the present war man
conversion campaign,” said Mr., J. R. Collins (secretary to the Commonwealth
Treasury) before leaving Sydney for Melbourne by the.steamer Jvarooia on
Saturday.
‘‘The fact is,” he added, “that tens of thousands of holders of small
bonds in the war loan, which has to be converted or paid off not later
than 15tli December, will, seemingly, neither take cash for their holdings
nor convert them info the new conversion issue at the extra rate of interest
offered.
“There may, of course, be a small number of them who have mapped out
fresh investments for themselves, but the great majority don t seem to be
worrying themselves in the slightest whether they lose the chance of goo
interest or not.
“Already many have missed their opportunity, because so much new cash
has come in"that the Treasury will not now accept applications from more
than one in three of those who have not converted.
“All that concerns me at the moment,” Mr. Collins concluded, is that
these hesitating or apathetic bondholders will come along an d ask tor theu
holdings to be converted when it is too late for the Treasury to accom-
modate them.
“The actual position is that for a very limited time the holders can cash
their holdings at par, plus interest accrued to date, or may convert their
four and a half per cents, into the new five and a half per cents, nee
of State income tax.”

Name and address must appear on the MSS. No

unless stamps accompany.
Buna: “Skee” or “shee,” whichever you
like. Webster says it’s “skee” and Amundsen, when
lie talked here, made it that t 00.... Quiver: Sorry
we haven’t room to let your pendulum swing. It’s
not a bad bit of work... .R.H.L. (Esperance Bay):
Already dealt with; and the fact that you sent the
same matter to other papers would disqualify it
so far as The Bulletin is concerned. This paper
doesn’t touch syndicated MS M.8.P.: “Un-
achieved” is worth some more elbow-grease....
J.P.Q. ; Still doesn’t quite draw the weight
T.H.C.: The other was vacant land... .H.R.M.:
You’ve got to tell that kind of story with more detail
as to time and place, or nobody will believe you. .. .
H.K.: There is something wrong somewhere. That
building isn’t where you say it is... .M. 0.8.:
“Rotary” is much too long. .. .Ellen Dee: Rather
thin skilly. .. .T.A.E.; “Some word or two here
and there may be left out.” you say; “I have no
time to read it over.” We haven’t time to read that
sort of MS. either... .Frank W.: Hardly worth while.
....Fin Hag: Comb your brains. You have ideas,
but you get them all tangled in expression.
Gigad: Can’t afford so much space for mere sum-
maries of book contents.... G.M.8.: The verse is bad,
and the grammar rocky... .J.C.W.: One charming
stanza :
Just why the vessel would not steer
Was never made, to me, quite clear ;
It seemed—so far as I could hear—
The fault lay in the steering-gear.
. ...J.A.L.: Loose stringing together of common-
places. .. .R.S.E.: Told in a quarter of the space it
would have been better. .. .H.W.8.: Doesn’t hit us
hard enough... .G.R.L.C.: The monkey yarn is too
thin..-. .R.W.K.: l!iot enough there... .J.R.L.: Com-
monplaces in wooden verse... .N.W. (.Man-borough) :
The sonnet is nearly good enough ; the rest are not
up . .. .B.T. (Bacchus Marsh) : Not by a long distance.
....Oliver B.: The top note of ecstasy:—
It was after the rain.
Meeting Steve, and Old Bill,
One saw the smiles that smiled again,
Bill lined us up to have our fill.
What Ho! No stop, there’s no doubt!
When Roy opened a-bottle —a bottle of champagne—
Joy it does bring even to the rouseabout,
After a good soaking of rain.
Steve with that face hard lines did show,
You silly goat, how did you know ;
A month’s bristles, a toothbrush mo,
We’re bound to get hay now to mow.
All right, quite all right, says Old Bill,
I know all about it;
When you see all the bags I’m to fill
You’ll take a double header, and a fit.
Good-bye till rain
And then we’ll meet again.
... . P.L. (North Bondi) : Not badly done, but not
enough in it W.J.S. • Light weight.;.. .Libra:
The lines are unattractive and it lacks point.
E.J.G.: Fair work ; but ah average of three varia-
tions of the same theme flow in and out every week.
....H.R.M.: Substitution of treacle for opium is
01d....D.D. (Vaucluse) : This is a poor market for
goods like the pansy-hill yarn.... Bede W.: No use.
Ben Gun: “Devine Youth” does not enrapture
us. .. .M.F.8.; Not a satisfying tale. .. .Caringa : Toe
thin. . . .H.B. (Havelock N.) : Not enough hops in
your brew— .Edwin W.: Sad little piece of futility.
.... Gee Bung: Doesn't say anything worth saying.
. ...J.D.C.; A bit too lumpy....P. O. Mac: The
lines are ragged and the themes thin D.P.0.:
No, we can’t celebrate your sixteenth birthday in
that verse. On the sample sent, we judge you might,
if you work, have something fit to celebrate your
twenty-fifth birthday Porepunkah: Nothing in
them and no skill shown ... .B2R: No resemblance to
verse and there is nothing in the idea to carry it.
... .Ripponlea: What tragic intensity there is in
it!:—
Th’ Cemetery was tinted by the phosphorescence of
th’ Moon
Save for gaunt shadows of Cypress and Tomb.
Th’ Phantom Hearse instantaneously appeared,
Drave by. a Spectre whose bleared
Optics and pasty cheeks
Gleamed fish-like in their tranquillity.
The whole figure was wrapped in effulgent immobility.
E’en the emaciated tentacles resting still.
Th’ Hearse rattled on until
It came to a groaning halt in a queer place.
After _ descending with weak squeak upon creak
Th’ Wraith reared on Its toebones with a wild, weird
screak—
The listless hands swinging in strict contradiction
To the limbs extended in mimeric benediction;
Pointing downward to th’ Stygian Mists,
And swinging dismally from the grizzly wrists.
All of a sudden a terrific wind swirled by leaf and
wreath
Unheeded by sleepers who lay stretched beneath
In their narrow houses. It whinnied through the
Apparition’s wither’d skin
As It twisted about with a malevolent grin.
. ...P.J.W.: The verse is not badly handled, but
you can’t make the dialect by merely aspirating
every v0we1.... F.F.: Good craftsmanship, but you
make some words scan to a false pronunciation.
“Pomegranate,” for instance, is three syllables, not
four. Also avoid extravagances and remember not
to mix “thous” and “yous”... .5.H.8.: Those verses
that go on asking a number of quite unnecessary
questions are a weariness... .N.O. (Fitzroy) : Poor
attempt at mirth.... Keith K.: The drum doesn’t
stir us W.D.F.: “Mnemonic Value” not bright
enough... .A.R.C.: There can be only one “Hia-
watha.” Many critics think that is too many....
A.S.: Only says what some extravagant politicians
have been saying... .Ross D.: The verse moves very
heavily in the language of prose.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G.C.H.: Making progress, but only at a snail’s
pace... . J.G.R.: No bother; but do a lot of work*
before you try again... .A.A.T.: Faint pencil scratches
never won a Bulletin cheque... .L.S.: Might amuse
the family, but the public is less tolerant. .. .G.L.:
Too finicky and microscopic ; give yourself more space
and try bolder penwork... .R.J.M.: Poor drawing
cl ttered up with labels.... D.M.: Learn to draw
correctly before you use solid black shadows....
A.11.Y.; Machine-made man, and is the other a
woman or a tadpole?
“Colliboi”: Among picturesque place-
names, Tabberabbera and Upotipotpon, both
in Victoria, surely merit belated mention.
South Aus. can supply 80-Peep; and finally
what of W. Tree (Gippsland)?


_ Whatever Yohr
Skin Trouble
At this time of the year when pimples, blotches, boils,
abscesses and similar skin-ailments are so troublesome,
your over-burdened okin needs the purifying aid of
Zam-Buk.
Start now and coax your skin back to health with
nightly dressings of this balm —the first applications of
which will end the dreadful itching and act as a tonic.
The regular use of Zam-Buk has a far-reaching influence;
composed of highly-refined essences which are readily
absorbed by the skin, Zam-Buk soaks through the pores,
attacking the trouble at its source and so ridding the
tissues of all impurities.
Lastly, when all sore, inflamed parts have been
soothed and cleared, and all swellings allayed, there is a
splendid new growth of healthy, strong skin. Zam-Buk
cannot but have a wholly beneficial effect on your
skin, as it is free from animal fats and coarse mineral
drugs which only clog the pores and often retard healing.
Don’t endure fiery skin torture a day longer—get a box of Zam-Buk
from your chemist or storekeeper. Nothing can equal it in cases of
piles, poisoned wounds, scalp sores, ringworm, etc. Also as a sure healer for
cuts, bruises and burns. 1/6 per box or 3/6 (family size).

Indigestion !
That's its name, INDIGESTION—the enemy of health and all which
make for happiness and contentment and the joy of living.
But why allow this distressing, spirit-reducing complaint to hold

that renowned Indigestion Remedy:
KRUSE’S .
Even one dose of this sterling preparation will convince you of
its genuine character.
KRUSE’S FLUID MAGNESIA will gently-but surely-expel from
your system the cause of your digestive ailments. It will make
for health and wholesomeness in the stomach, sweeten the breath,
cool and purify the blood, and induce the feeling of
fitness and keenness of early youth.

“Coppertop”: A new industry has been
started by an enterprising Queensland com-
pany which will endeavor to meet Australian
demands for turtle-soup. It lias char-
tered the steamer Nautilus, which left Bris-
bane a few days ago with canning plant for
lleron Island, about 40 miles from Glad-
stone. At the finish of the turtle season,
which opens on October 1 and closes on
January 31, the company expects to have
125,000 tins of soup ready for consumption.
* * * *
“Seebee”: There are 30 competitors for
Spencer-street (Melb.) bridge design. If
weight is any guide the last 10 received ought
to have the best show. One aspirant for
the first prize of £750 sent a model the size
of a giant’s coffin. Former Melbourne Uni.
students accused a titled prof, of their day
of testing the value of exam, papers by
weighing them when he was in a hurry and
of giving passes to those who had forwarded
the heaviest. The task of the Board of adju-
dicators for Spencer-street bridge would be
easy if they could adopt that plan.
* * * *
“L.H.0.” (British Honduras) : Mention
was made by “Askeaton” in a late Bulletin
of various countries to which Aus-
tralian butter is consigned. This colony
can be added to the list, as Melbourne
tinned butter at present holds the market
here. It has to travel two-thirds round the
world before it gets spread on the local
johnnycake. If Australian butter can com-
pete successfully with American, surely other
products packed for tropical conditions
should find an equally brisk demand.
*** * %
“N.K.C.”: As an out-back State school-
teacher I receive a princely £1 Is. 6d. a month
from the Vic. Government for maintenance.
This is supposed to cover the cost of clean-
ing, scrubbing, sanitary requirements, fire-
wood, cords, locks, etc., for the school itself.
Ink, pencils and paper have to be provided ;
also towels, basins, soap and school-books for
the children —all for ss. 4£d. per week. It
simply means that a hardworked country
teacher has to turn to after school and act
as caretaker and sanitary man. Many of
us eke out the inadequate allowance by
selling school vegetables.
* * * *
“Buttenderry”: The S.A. consignment of
51,000 dozen eggs (B. 1/10/’25) is by no
means an Australian record. The Coastal
Farmers’ Co-op. Society (N.S.W.) has made
at least three larger consignments this year :
August 29, Jervis Bay, 90,600 dozen; Sep-
tember 14, Bodrara, 60,000 dozen ; Sep-
tember 22, Hobson’s Bay, 70,000 dozen. Since
the commencement of the export season late
in August there had been shipped from Syd-
ney 383,000 dozen, the consignments of the
C.F.S. Society alone totalling 261,000 dozen
-—this to the end only of September.
* * * *
“T.P.” : The infant department has come
into its own in Victoria, and colored pic-
tures suitable for kindergartens have been
imported from Britain and the U.S.A. by
the hundred thousand. Now for the first
time in the State a native artist, Miss
Amalie Feild, teacher of drawing in the Bal-
larat Technical School, has produced six
wall-decorations illustrating nursery rhymes.
The prints measure 20 by 30 inches, and
compare favorably with the productions from
older lands. There is no earthly reason why
local artists should not provide the Babes
in the Wood, Little Red Riding Hood and
the other figures dear to the infantile mind ;
one may even hope for the time when the
native-bear, .’possum and kangaroo will take
the place of oversea animals in schoolrooms,
and Australian landscape and seascape sup-
plant European scenery.
* * * *
“C. Coral”: A par. the other day to the
effect that Lismore (N.S.W.) people were
concerned because Malayan buyers were
holding off Australian butter under the im-
pression that it is made from “dogs’ milk”
recalls the mistake made by a well-known
southern bishop. In the Malayan case the
yarn had been circulated by a trade rival;
but ignorance of a favorite Queensland fruit
for conserve-making was responsible for the
other misunderstanding. The Bishop was
entertaining a fair visitor from Queensland,
who in the course of conversation at lunch
remarked that she was extremely fond of
rosella jam. “Rosella jam ?” queried the
ecclesiastic, with strong emphasis. “I know
that the rosella makes a good pie, but you
can’t ask me to believe that the Queens-
lander makes jam of the bird !” A certain
brand of butter carrying the kangaroo is,
they say, understood by some English folk
to be produced from the milk of that animal,
so perhaps the Malay is not to be laughed
at, after all. There is, also “Pineapple”
butter; and one could produce a list of other
commodities which carry a picture trade-
name that must be very confusing to the
foreign purchaser. This is a matter which
ought to receive attention from Australian
exporters.
* * * *
“Aragun”: “Retsam's” attempt to refute
my assertion that the Ma State does not
encourage the meat-export industry (B.
24/9/’25) Is unconvincing. Beef-breeders
here do pay attention to the quality of their
herd bulls; witness, without going any
further afield than. Sydney, the quality of
the station stock exhibited at the R.A. Show.
It is fairer to judge local enterprise by these
than by the worn-out old dairy cattle and
their offspring which the exorbitant killing
charges at Sydney and Newcastle abattoirs
force the smaller carcase butcher to buy.
As for the Newcastle abattoirs, besides charg-
ing the inspection fees stated, they grab with-
out payment the paunches, blood, gut fats,
feet, glue-pieces, etc., and, going one better
than Sydney, the caul fat; these incidentals
in themselves show a large profit over and
above killing expenses, and the fact
should induce the Meat Board to take
off 'the large inspection fees charged
its tenants. My remark that F. J.
Yv alker and Go. have extensive works
scattered around thg country lying idle is
not bosh. Even “Retsam” niffst have heard
of the Hunter River works at Leichhardt
and of the Tiboorena works, and lie may
have seen that Gladstone (Q.) has closed
down. Others, excluding the S. M. P. Co.
and Aberdeen, which are going only half-
time, certainly are not idle, but they a„re
freezing rabbits. *

SOAP-A
flat has
made Movie Stars
World-Famous for
their Beautiful Hair.
A Woman’s crowning glory is her hair,
whether it be bobbed or shingled, straight or
curly—and much of this glory depends on how
she washes it and what she uses. Rexona Soap is
the best and most satisfactory cleansing power
which can be employed. It gives new life to the
scalp, for it removes all dandruff, and conse-
quently the hair itself receives renewed vigor and
brightness.
The “silky’ ’ look is the charm of a well-dressed
head, but no matter how thick or wavy the hair
* may be, if it is devoid of that lustrous sheen it
will look frowsy. Rexona Soap ensures brilliance
of quality and quantity.

“O. McKay M.” : There is no good reason
why Frank Clarke, President of the vie.
Leg. Council, shouldn’t have asked H. 1.
Cohen to palaver “in a Christian spirit
(B. 24/9/’25). The forceful K.C. is one
of the pillars of Melbourne Anglo-Catholicism
and a great supporter of pan-Anglican Canon
Hughes, who acted as godfather to Cohen s
two sons, both well known to Trinity College
men.
“Titus Salt”: At last the buxom young
steamer Edina is being compared with an
even older ferry-boat, the paddle-steamer
Kangaroo, 104 tons, built at Hobart of Tas-
manian timber in 1853. The Kangaroo lias
been running on the Derwent (Tas.) for 7_
years, and it is claimed that she is the oldest
trading steamer in the world. Her original
beam engines, made in England, are still
little the worse for wear. The Edina, on
the contrary, does not contain any of her
original materials. The Kangaroo will stop
hopping between Hobart and Bellerive
(named after The Bulletin’s poet). A
new vehicle ferry, costing £36,000 in Eng-
land, will take up the running.
“Bris”: Industrial insurance collectors
have a union in Queensland, with an Arbi-
tration award and a minimum wage of £4
10s. a week. Commercial travellers also
have a union, and are drafting a log for the
Arbitration Court. An attempt is now being
made to unionise the land salesmen, or
“go-getters.” The difficulty of organising
them is that the successful do well on com-
mission, while the unsuccessful are. soon
driven out of the game by the impossibility of
making a living at it. The first attempt to
form a union was frustrated by the benevo-
lent bosses, but another attempt is being
made.
“Zanthus”: Gavin Scott may have been
the pioneer of the modern export trade in
N.S.W. hardwood, but when he set out with
his samples in 1894 (B. 8/10/’25) the export
trade was just celebrating its centenary.
The first hardwood exported from Australia
was taken from Sydney to Calcutta in 1794
in a brig appropriately named the Experi-
ment. In succeeding years merchant vessels
took a good deal of hardwood, as well as a
lot of cedar, to England, India and the. Cape.
Even the King’s ships took a hand in the
game. The Glatton carried a cargo of hard-
wood for the naval dockyards in 1802 and
other men-of-war followed suit. There may
have been Australian timber in some of the
vessels that fought at Trafalgar.
“T.P.”: Finding that Sale (Vic.) district
schools were at their wits’ end to obtain a
suitable block of ground for tree-planting
for endowment purposes, Mr. Stares,' a Long-
ford farmer, presented a suitable area of
country to the children, who planted 1000
trees as a start. This will be continued
annually, and in 15 years’ time cutting
will commence, and cash will come in for
educational purposes. Given a few thousand
more Stares in Australia, the timber
problem wrnuld be solved. Not only did he
give the ground, but, throwing off his coat,
lie toiled for days removing suckers from
the land. The scheme is a fine one, and
future generations will call the name of
Stares blessed.
“Herodot” : New times, new ways of mak-
ing a living. One person in Sydney is known
to have collected three separate amounts for
alleged injuries to himself and clothes with-
in as many months, and there are others.
In each case he stepped in front of a car
moving at a slow speed, and after being
knocked down succeeded in squirming out of
the way of the wheels. Of course were such
claims contested it is unlikely that they
would be successful; but the average motor-
ist prefers to avoid the worry and the chance
of striking an unsympathetic Judge or jury,
and so usually considers himself well out
of it by the payment of live or ten pounds on
the spot.
A Sydney man well in touch with his time
is John Quigg, caretaker of the Bunnerong
Cemetery, Botany. He has over 500 clocks.
Most of them he bought as worn out for a
few pence. Having rejuvenated them they
all go. Among his collection is the long-
deposed post-office clock from the original
building in Wvnyard-square. This ancient
timepiece he secured for £l. Another clock
of Dutch make is estimated to be 220 years
old. Strange and wonderful in design, even
the pendulums of many have a history. One
is the shoe from a racing pony that fell dead
at Kensington, while another is a rubber
heel from some dainty number 3 which once
pressed down the turf on the lawn at Rand-
wick racecourse.
“Uramao”: Maoriland has just awakened
to the fact that it ought to be celebrating
a centenary this year. Edward Gibbon
Wakefield had a wild youth; he eloped with
a young lady at 20, and after her death de-
coyed a young girl from school and married
her at Gretna Green, spent three years in
Newgate for the abduction, and then planned
his colonisation scheme for Maoriland, his
association with convicts bound for Botany
Bay giving birth to his ideas. In 1825 a
company was formed, and with the approval
of Lord Bathurst sent representatives to
M.L., but on their seeing the war dance of
Maoris they beat a retreat. This was the
prelude to the formation of the company that
put into effect Wakefield’s colonising scheme.
“Jog”; Delegates to the conference of the
Sugar Producers’ Association at Bundaberg
(Q.) watched a demonstration of Falkiner’s
cane harvester. After seeing it cut, collect and
top 40 tons of cane in an hour, with an ex-
penditure of a few pints of kerosene and a
trifle of lubricating oil, the sugar men pro-
nounced it superior to the best gang in the
country. R. S. Falkiner —of the N.S.W.
stock-raising family—is the financial backer
of the inventor, one Charley, who has built
on Hurrey’s idea of some years ago. The
contraption is of huge dimensions and
would have frightened any self-respecting
Kanaka off the place. It js lift, high and
weighs five tons. The weight, however, is
spread over a fair area. There seems to be
no doubt of its efficiency, and the running
costs are insignificant. What troubles the
grower is the cost of construction. If that
pans out all right, harvesting exes, are
going to come down with a run. The machine
used in the demonstration ran away with
£3OOO, but of course that was exceptional.
A demonstration is to be given on a Cuban
minefield, too; so Australia is not to have
this good thing all to itself.

The One-Profit Studebaker is
Not a One-Year Car
Drives Studebakev
400,000 Miles
With a record of 10|- years of
service and 400,000 miles
covered, the first Studebaker
owned by C. E. Viljoen, Kim-
berley, South Africa, is still in
service carrying mail between
Kimberley and Kuruman, a
distance of 172 miles. Regard-
less of roads or weather, Mr.
Viljoen has never missed a
trip and has never been late.
Another Studebaker pur-
chased by Mr. Viljoen has 3
record of 122,000 miles.
Throughout the world, Stude-
baker gives the same depend-
able low-cost service, because
it is a one-profit car —built as
a unit.
dfs
UY a Studebaker with the expectation o!
securing thousands of miles of dependable s
economical service.
Studebaker and Ford are the only two American
cars made on the one-profit basis. Only in these
two cases are all bodies, engines, clutches, gear
boxes, springs, differentials, steering gears, axles,
gray iron castings and drop forgings made by
one company.
One-profit production enables Studebaker to use
finer steels and better materials of every kind
The result is a well balanced, perfectly co-ordi-
nated car, possessing stamina and durability
which defies time.
You can pay more, but you’ll find no sturdier or
more dependable car than the one-profit Stude*
baker.

Rexona—The
Rapid Healer
“My little boy Jack met with a very bad accident through
a wall collapsing on him, with the result that he was in the
hospital for four months. He had half of his foot torn away
and the doctors thought they would have to amputate it above
the ankle, but after a lot of treatment and skin-grafting he
returned home, but it broke out again and he had to go
back in the hospital to have more skin grafted on.
“After he was home a little while we tried to get him to
use his foot, but it broke away again, and the doctor said he
would have to go back in the hospital again.
“I was advised to use Rexona Ointment, which I did, and
only used two tins and his foot completely healed, and he has
not had any trouble with it since. I found Rexona of great
value, and it saved a great deal of trouble and expense.”

REXONA —The
Family First Aid
Accidents, more or less serious, are always happening to
one or another of every family. The busy mother, with much
to do and very little time to do it in, is not so careful of
herself as she might be, and a cut or burn often results.
The ever-active children, overflowing with fun and frolic,
frequently hurt themselves and come running home with tear-
stained faces to show a cut or bruised leg, and father comes
home from his work with a painful hurt or cut.
All these injuries, not so serious in themselves, may become
so if neglected,' and it is then that the mother welcomes a
really reliable remedy which is easily applied and can be
depended upon to heal quickly.
Rexona fills this need. There is no better treatment than
to get a tin of Rexona and apply this rapid healer night and
morning. First clean the sore with warm water and Rexona
Soap, then apply a little Rexona and protect the wound from
contact with the clothing with a soft bandage. The most
troublesome sores will heal under this treatment in a few days.
The wise mother will always be p repared for emergencies by keep-
ing a pot of Rexona handy.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tree!
I Now do I know the feeling in your
limbs
When the fresh sap soars thrilling
through the wood
And, like a surging tide, there brims
An ecstasy
In branch and bud!
I know as none but earth’s own children
could !
There is a mighty singing in my blood !
There is a singing in my blood! I heard
Out of the warm-breathed night a startled
bird
Cry with a rapture through the wild ;
And then—ah sweet! —
The eager feet
Of some strange wind that stirred the dew
Go tripping like a dancing child.
And then I knew!
I know
That, should I wander out and go
Into the thick, dark wood, I'd see
V mystic veil on every tree;
And through each smoky lilac fold,
Pale buds like pearls, drenched amber wings
And little silver shoots that hold
The promise of all lovely things.
I’d kneel upon the earth and lind
Between the slanting purple shades,
Where trellised sun-slats cross and cross,
Frail, frosted webs with stalks entwined
And slender, spear-straight, emerald blades
Springing from out the chaliced moss.
I know
That out upon the plain,
The frilled white daisies heap like snow
And yellow capeweed bares again
Old blackish buds to greet the sun.
And where the filmy bluebells lean
By mottled shell-grass, palely green,
The little white-tailed rabbits run.
Then, lying hidden, I should hear
The blackbird singing near and near;
Vnd from some dream half-dreamed, remote,
The pallid cuckoo’s wavering note.
I shall walk singing by the dark, blue sea.
Upon the silver bushes I shall lie
And feel the sun drink up the heart of me;
And, white against the floating cornflower
sky,
Watch the red-footed gulls soar up and up,
Wheeling across the cloudy, coastal plain.
And in the hummocks’ warm, wind-hollowed
cup,
Where rosy sea-eggs and the rotting weeds
have lain,
Watch the sea-poppies break their crinkled
silk
And pallid cliff-forget-me-nots push through
the scrub,
The torn clematis flowers as white as milk
biir through its tangled stems and jade-
tipped fuchsia bells
Shake from their cover. I shall hear
The blossoming tea-tree rasp and rub
In places where the old leaves are;
And, while the fuming tide-race swells
' ike distant music to the ear,
The muted chiming on the bar.
And I shall lie, and sing alone,
In walks no other feet have known—-
Oh, all alone, alone I’ll be,
Loving my loneliness beside the sea!
And in the night,
If I should go
Along the sleeping street, I’d smell
Unguessed-at scents of sheer delight
From little buds that break and swell—
voluptuous breaths that rise and flow
From dark pittosporum hedges and the hot,
Sweet smell of roses from some shrouded
plot—
And see the moon.
Soft like a ball of silver thistledown,
iMoat o’er the dreaming chimneys of the
town
And vague white lovers, walking two by two,
Between dim arches drenched with chilly
blue.
T am awake!
Oh, I am born again !
Gone is my grief like scudding mists that
break ;
Gone o’er the world with the white weeping
rain !
With warm, young arms outheld I stand,
i ome love! Come joy! Come pain!
('ome something now to me!
For here, with beauty at my hand,
Nothing there is too great to be !
There can be nothing now but good
Here with the smell of swollen wood.
Here with the scent of new-burst bud,
To set this singing in my blood.
The seven angels veil before
The glory of God’s awful face;
But I have torn my hands away
And looked till I could look no more.
Oh, hear! I have in some still place
Seen the earth’s features plain as day—
Mystic and beautiful her quiet eyes.
Her mouth a secret, and her forehead wise.
Oh, I have seen, and I am born again!
Unutterable joy ! Undreamed of pain !
iNow nothing is too great to be!
Come something now; come, come to me!
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
A Tale of Old Batavia.
[FOF THE BULLETIN.]
A SIGHT which is shown to the tourist
in Java is a high wall enclosing a
neglected patch of ground near the
castle of Jacatra in old Batavia. On the
wall is the inscription : “In execrable remem-
brance of the damnable traitor Pieter Erbor-
,'eld, this spot shall neither be built upon,
ploughed nor planted from now until the
end of time.” Impaled on a rusty pike stuck
in the wall is an enormous human skull
whose unnatural size has led the natives to
regard it as the head of a. giant, but is pro-
bably due to the successive coats of white-
wash the skull has received in the two
hundred years that have elapsed since it was
put in position.
* * * *
Mrs. Van der Hoogen always spent her
evenings in the same way, rocking gently
in her chair on one side of the little round-
topped table on her verandah; on the other
side her daughter Meeltje and that young
fellow who was courting her, Pieter Erber-
feld, sat rocking too. The oil-lamp, hanging
low overhead, flung its rays outwards across
the dark expanse of the Aloon-aloon, which
was lined on the opposite side with other
bungalows, on whose verandahs sat other
little groups of rocking men and women.
Around the thin rectangle of European
houses spread, in a closely-packed medley of
basket-work huts fenced into squares, the
sleeping kampongs of the native population.
When the rocking on the other side of
the table ceased for a moment Mrs. Van der
Hoogen would move her head abruptly, and
immediately the creaking of the chairs would
recommence. Now and then the lovers would
speak to each other in gentle undertones,
and whenever the soft murmur of their
voices reached her ears the motion of Mrs.
Van der Iloogen’s chair would slacken
almost imperceptibly.
When Pieter Erberfeld began his formal
courtship, coming persistently every evening
to drink gin and bitters and sit beside the
old lady and opposite her daughter at the
round table surrounded by easy-chairs, she
had at once greeted him with silent disfavor
and suspicion. He would be yet another
of these buayas, these crocodiles, coming
after her Meeltje, because some day that
foolish young girl would inherit her mother’s
spice plantations in Amboina and a hundred
slaves. He seemed to be greatly at his ease,
the young man, rocking gently in his chair
and smoking her cigars. He always spoke
with deference to her, with decorous anima-
tion to her daughter. In the dark shadows
of her eyebrows Mrs. Van der Hoogen’s eyes
would move suspiciously. With suspicion
she listened to his accent, which sometimes
sounded so like a white man’s, a totolc’s, a
true white man’s, and at other times so like
her own. She listened acutely to the noise
of his drinking, and his cough startled her
like a betrayal of his ancestry. She was
tortured with doubts of the plausible history
of himself which he had given her. He
would stay for an hour, discreetly refusing
the second gin and bitters that was always
offered as the period to his call.
Mrs. Van der Hoogen was conscious of
her daughter’s devotion to her lover, and
knew how her blood, darkened by generations
of Eurasian unions, flamed at the touch of
his plump fingers. In the club she kept
Meeltje closely guarded, and made her sit
with the other women at one end of the
room. She would be aware of the eyes of
young Erberfeld staring hungrily from the
men’s end. Once in an evening she would
allow them to dance; and even while they
danced she knew how the dark blood mounted
hot with shame and delight into Meeltje’s
checks at the infrequent contact of their
bodies. Just beyond the fan of light flung
by the open doorways upon the grass out-
side, the natives sat find whispered in admira-
tion and disgust of the shameless white
women who danced a vicious dance in public.
Mrs. Van der Hoogen was blind, but the
loss of her eyes by a disease common amongst
the natives had given her a stronger spiritual
insight. She lived in the dread of race
extinction, clinging desperately to the last
moiety of white blood which her ancestors’
commercially profitable but racially improvi-
dent marriages had left her. She could not
conceal her distrust of the young men who
came to visit her daughter. They were all
chichis, all half-breeds —like herself. The
great multitude of the native population
seemed to swell round her like a flood of
brown waters, of which these young fellows
were the first ripples. As the evening recep-
tion hour drew near she would sit, her
white hair gleaming under the oil-lamp on
her verandah, her bony hands pressed against
her temples and her sightless eyes staring
straight before her, as if watching for the
approach of that invasion. She would sit
thus, listening intently to the noises of Euro-
pean and native life passing in the street;
and the black shadows under her eyebrows,
unlighted in their depths by any sign of
life, gave her face the appearance of tre-
mendous inner vision.
Although she was blind, Mrs. Van der
Hoogen’s other senses were able to paint a
picture for her of the young fellow’s physical
appearance. She knew his footsteps, his
tricks of gesture, his height and weight as
well as if she could have seen his tall body;
but her perception, acute as it was, could not
tell her the color of his skin. Aware as she
was of the lovers’ most secret glances, still
she had never been able to obtain an answer
to the painful suspicion which obsessed her
mind. In that community of varying shades
of color, surrounded by a hostile sea of
natives, there was a conspiracy of silence on
the subject of legitimacy and descent. They
were all whites who wore boots and they
were all natives who went barefoot. Every
inion that produced offspring was a marriage.
Thus, Mrs. Van der Hoogen, who, dark as
she was, bore the name of a great Dutch
family, knew that it was useless to ask her
mirasian friends to tell her the truth about
her future son-in-law. Tormented by the
hope and desire of the regeneration of her
family,* she leant one night suddenly across
the table and passed a quivering brown hand
over the animated face of Pieter Erberfeld,
which immediately froze into watchful
immobility. In strained suspense the lovers
waited while the old lady’s hand glided
over the young man’s features, over the
large and bony forehead, the long nose and
upper-lip, the thin and drooping mouth.
Pausing momentarily on the inconsistency
of the high cheek-bones, it descended to the
ample fulness of the chin. Then falling back
into her chair, the old lady resumed her
enigmatic stare, while across the black orbit
of her blindness the lovers exchanged an in-
voluntary glance of mingled fear and
triumph.
Strolling home from an evening at the
Van der Iloogens’, Pieter Erberfeld con-
gratulated himself on the way his plans were
going. With a feeling of almost physical
pleasure he felt mingling in his veins the
blood of his two parents like partners in his

conspiracy—the blood of his German father,
the political refugee from Europe, and the
blood of his Javanese mother, the daughter
of the famous and execrated rebel Surapati.
That was what the white men called his
mother’s father —-a rebel. Well, he would be
a rebel too and he would finish the work
that Surapati had begun! He would drive
the white men into the sea. He would set
Java free once more, restore, the ancient
dynasty, and. with the help of loyal half-
castes like himself, mould it into a mighty
empire. He would spread its dominion over
the neighboring islands again, to Sumatra
and Borneo, to the great Southland where
gold and pearl traders under the Dutch
monopoly no longer went as they had of old:
('veil to Asia. And everywhere he would
drive the white spawn before him. He
would root them out, men, women and white-
faced children; and their allies, the rene-
gade half-castes-*—ho would extirpate the
whole accursed race ! Except Meeltje. And
perhaps that foolish old blind woman, her
mother. Despite that old vixen’s treachery,
her hatred of his people, he would spare
her for Meeltje’s sake. And, besides, she
was useful. He could meet his fellow-con-
spirators in her compound without rousing
suspicion. As long as the old viper did not
find out what they were, about! Why just
now did she try that trick of feeling his face?
Did she think she could feel the color of his
skin? Well, in three days the blow would
be struck and to-night the oatn would be
taaen, an oath so binding that no native
would dare to break it even to save himself
from torture. Across the soft whispering
canvas of the night Erberfeld painted a
glowing picture of the future, in which
revenge, ambition and the possession of
Meeltje’s beautiful brown body mingled.
That night, lying sleepless on her bed,
Mrs. Van der Hoogen heard stealthy footsteps
in her garden and the stilt rustle of waxed
sarong cloth. She heard warning whispers
drifting across the stillness of her bedroom.
It was not the first time she had listened to
those whispers, and tormented her mind with
speculating what they were. She waited
with a beating heart until the whispers died
away and then crept out on to her verandah.
Feeling her way silently through the familiar
geography of her compound, she reached the
storehouse. Through the thin kajang walls
she heard the sound of voices. In quick,
passionate whispers from the Javanese chiefs
and calm level tones from that young fellow
Erberfeld, there were wafted to her ears
the whole details of the plot. With sinister
murmurings the conspirators repeated one
after the other the words of the dreadful
oath proposed by Pieter Erberfeld. To his
sweetheart’s mother, crouching on trembling
hands and knees against the wall outside,
his words seemed like the blasphemous
moutliings of an incarnate fiend. To murder
all the whites, to pour out that holy stream
of European blood! She heard her own
name mentioned as one to be spared in the
general massacre. Of what use would that
be when there would be no white people
left!
Then she heard a new voice, repeating
'quietly the incredible phrases of that ter-
ritic oath. It was Meeltje’s! Tottering
back to bed, Mrs. Van der Hoogen lay sick
with horror, waiting for the daylight, when
she would be able to summon a slave to take
her to the Governor’s palace and inform him
of the plot.
Under the vast, aching vault of the Java-
nese sky, out of which the sun seemed to
send its heat in great hammer-strokes that
beat indifferently on all alike, on white and
black, on mountain and plain, on empty field
and crowded roadway, an immense concourse
of Europeans and natives was making its
way towards the Koningsplein of old
Batavia. The gay head-dresses and sarongs
of the inlanders made quickly changing
groupings of vivid color along the roads.
Their faces showed neither passion, curiosity
nor fear. They talked quietly, like listless
children, stepping sedately aside to let the
furiously-driven Europeans go past in their
carriages and litters. Only the white faces
showed any feeling. The Europeans stared
irritably into the impassive faces of the
natives, trying to read there what this doing
to death of men of their own race by foreign
rulers meant to them. The Europeans had
put on their best clothes as though for a fes-
tival. Mothers had brought their children
and husbands their wives and concubines.
There was exultation on their faces.
Along the fringes of the crowd, at the
side of the road, moved Meeltje and her
mother. The old woman held her daughter’s
arm with a grasp that made the tears run
down the girl’s cheeks, and her sightless eyes
moved restlessly frorfi side to side as her
preternaturally keen faculties sensed the
spiritual atmosphere of her surroundings.
“Why have the people stopped just here,
girl?” she asked, holding her daughter back.
“They are reading. What is it they are
reading, child? Tell me!”
Over the heads of the native crowd the
half-caste girl began to read a notice pasted
on a wall: —
We, the Judges, having heard and examined the
information preferred ex officio by Henri Van Steel,
drossard of the Low Country, against the herein-
after mentioned criminals who, have confessed the
whole and committed themselves voluntarily to
this conclusion, it is therefore concluded and decreed
in justice, in the name of their High Mightinesses
the States-General of the United Provinces, that
we condemn the said prisoners, with the approbation
of the Governor-General, Mr. Zwardekroon;, and
of the Counsellors of the Indies, to be transported
to the place before the Citadel, there to be delivered
into the hands of the hangman, in order to receive
their respective punishments in the manner follow-
ing: The lesser criminals, Tomboam, Grambiek, and
Milas are condemmed to be each of them tied to
a stake, and there strangled till they are dead.
Their bodies shall be then carried to the common
place of execution, and there exposed on wheels for
the nourishment of the birds. The ten greater
criminals shall be each of them tied upon a cross
on the scaffold, and, in case there be not room
on the scaffold itself, on a place near it, where
they shall be broken alive, without receiving the
coup de grace. They shall be afterwards carried to
the ordinary place of execution, and there exposed
on a wheel, and guarded so long as they shall
live there; and, after they expire, be left a prey
to the birds. But the principal traitor, Pieter
Erberfeld. .. .
The girl’s voice faltered and she stopped.
“Mother, I cannot read it.”
The old woman’s grip tightened on her
daughter’s arm until the girl swayed with
the pain.
“You cannot read it? What did I promise
you? That I would not tell his Excellency
you were one of them, that you took that
dreadful oath, if you led me to the execution
and told me all you saw. And now you will
not read a notice!”
The girl’s hands dragged at her cheeks as
if she were keeping her eyes open by main
force, and her voice went on: —
The principal traitor, Pieter Erberfeld, shall be
extended and bound upon a cross, where he shall
have his right hand cut off, and his arms, legs and
breasts pinched with redhot pincers, till pieces of
the flesh are torn away. He shall then have his
belly ripped up from bottom to top, and his heart
thrown in his face; after which his head shall
be cut off, and fixed upon a post; and his body, being
torn to pieces, shall be exposed to the fowls of the
air without the city, in whatever place the Govern-
ment shall please to direct. Done and decreed in
the assembly of my lords the Counsellors of .Justice
this Wednesday' the Bth of April, 1722, all the
Judges, except Mr. Craivanger, being present.
“Is that everything there is, daughter?”
asked the old woman eagerly, as the girl’s
voice trailed off into silence. “Are you sure
there is nothing more?”
“Nothing more, mother.”
“Good. Then let us be going.”
Holding tighter than ever to her daughter’s
arm, she hurried her through the crowd,
which thickened along the dusty road and
then broadened as it spread itself over the
grass of the great Koningsplein. Forcing
her companion through the passive mob, the
old woman reached the inner edge of a huge
circle of silently watching natives, and there
she stopped.
“Can you see well, child?” she asked. “Is
the position good?”
“Yes, mother,” whispered the girl, staring
with dim eyes across the wide open space
covered with strange objects and shifting
groups of people.
“Tell me what you see, my dear. Every-
thing !”
“There are cannon, mother,” whispered
the girl. “They are pointing towards us
and soldiers with lighted matches are stand-
ing by them.”
“Yes, yes, what else?”
“All the counsellors are there, mother, in
their tall hats and black coats and white
breeches. And Mr. Zwardekroon, in his gold
uniform and white stockings, and all the
military officers. And Mynheer Lels, mother,
the Governor’s secretary, he is there, very
busy, running about with papers in his
hand.”
“No, no, girl,” cried the old woman im-
patiently, “you are fooling me! Leave Myn-
heer Lels alone. The people are not looking
his way. Turn your eyes to the right.
There, to the right! A little more! Now,
what do you see?”
“Nothing, mother, there is nothing there.”
“Wipe your eyes,, fool! Tell me what you
see.”
‘•There is a tall man there, mother. He
is dressed in black. He has a mask on. He
is standing by the scaffold. There are se\en
crosses on the scaffold, mother, and three on
the grass. There is a man tied to each
cross.”
“What are they doing, those rebels? Toll
me, tell me!”
The girl passed her hand shuddenngly
over her eyes. . .
“Some are looking at the sky, mother, and
some at the ground. There are three more
behind, tied to stakes. They do not mov e.
The old lady sucked in her breath slowly
and relapsed into immobility. Presently she
raised her sightless eyes again.
“To the left, child. Look to the left. The
people’s eyes are moving to the left. \\ hat
do you see there?”
The girl’s eyes, like an animal s fascinated
by a snake, did not move. Lhey stared
straight in front of her. .
“Nothing, mother. There is nothing there.
Only the man in black is walking across the
green plain, with six slaves following him.
“Come, girl, come! You are looking the
other way. Look to the left and tell me
what you see.” The old woman s voice rose
to a 'thin shriek of mingled menace and
entreaty.
“The man in black has stopped, mother.
The six slaves are standing still. Ah.
mother, do not hurt me! There is a cross
there, a bigger cross than the others. They
are bringing him. Pieter ! My Pieter! They
are binding him on the cross. A slave has
struck him in the mouth. Mother, mother,
I cannot look! I cannot!”
“Open your eyes, Meeltje. Open them,
screamed the old woman, “or I shall open
them with my nails.”
“He is hanging on the cross. The man
in black has drawn his dirk. . Ah!” The
girl’s voice was broken by thick sobs, but
her eyes were dry and staring.
“Go on, child, go on!”
“He has cut off his right hand. Pieter
is looking at the sky. No! He is looking
at his hand. A slave is holding it up show-
ing it to the people. Mother!” Her voice
was lost in a low, expressionless murmur
that went up from the crowd.
“They have brought a stove. They are
heating something at it.”
“Stand up, girl, stand up!” cried the old
woman angrily, feeling her daughter's body
suddenly droop beside her. "Tell me how a
traitor meets his end.”
The girl’s voice was faint and far away
as if some obstacle had suddenly been erected
between them.
“They have great pincers in their hands.
The pincers are red-hot. They are going
towards Pieter. God ! They”—•—
“Pas op, girl, pas op,” whispered the old
woman in panic-stricken dismay. “Why arc
you dragging on my arm so? Wake up.
Meeltje, wake up! Och, darling, rouse your-
self. Quick! Open your eyes. You arc
missing everything. Ah, God verdomme, the
child has fainted!”
