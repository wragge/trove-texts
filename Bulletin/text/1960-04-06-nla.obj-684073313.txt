AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE
Cecil Hadgraft’s Australian Litera-
ture (Heinemann) was obviously
written for a textbook for secondary
schools or universities, and it seems
to me that the author or his publishers
have made a mistake in sending it
around for review as if it were intended
to be a contribution to belles-lettres
or to serious criticism.
1 do not think it is by any means
the ideal textbook for students of Aus-
tralian literature. Aware of some of
its deficiencies. Hadgraft says in his
foreword that “Some types of litera-
ture are not treated —dramatic, travel,
descriptive, juvenile, historical, bio-
graphical”; so that once again we have
that over-emphasis of trivial poetry
and fiction and that under-emphasis
—indeed total ignoring—of much more
important writing in history and
biography, etc., to which P. R.
Stephensen rightly objected in a Com-
monwealth Fund lecture lately reprinted
on the Red Page.
The inevitable result of such an
approach is not only that the student
gets a distorted and inadequate picture
of Australian writing but that, because
of its concentration on mediocrity and
mere historical sequence, the book
becomes dull. Perhaps a very enter-
taining writer could get some life out
of the minor novelists and poets who
strove to produce literature in the
early days of the colony; but Hadgraft
hardly sets out to be entertaining.
His defence, of course, for not includ-
ing the biographers and historians is
simply that there is not space for them;
but I think that room could easily be
found by judicious selection. Instead
of such a book as this which begins,
broadly, by complaining that there were
for a start no writers who felt at home
in this country or were able to write
naturally and unselfconsciously about
it. I would prefer a textbook beginning
with those who did respond naturally
to the country and who. therefore,
humbly or otherwise, produced from
the outset a valid and enduring Aus-
tralian literature: the writers of the old
bush songs and ballads, the writers of
diaries, letters and memoirs.
However, granting that “Australian
Literature” is the kind of textbook
Hadgraft set out to write, it is. 1 should
say. quite adequate and valuable. It
is a conscientious historical survey of
Australian writing from the arrival of
the First Fleet—or. at any rate, from
the odes of the ineffable Michael
Massey Robinson—right through to
1955; it embodies the results of a great
deal of industrious research; it is
interesting talk about books; its critical
opinions are well enough, sometimes to
serve as a guide for students, sometimes
(one hopes) as a point of departure:
and if it is generally dull, written in
that peculiarly unhandy style sacred to
textbooks and schoolboys' essays
(“The first person narrative is favored
by Lawson”) and too much given to
pedantic and sometimes mistaken
niggling about trifles —four words in
an exquisite lyric by McCrae; one
phrase in a poem of David Campbell's
—students, poor wretches, are doubt-
less long inured to all that.
But as a contribution to belles-
lettres —it is simply, because of its style,
not beautiful. And as a contribution
to serious criticism it is too much like
a series of pot-shots: some of which
hit the mark (if that is what a pot-
shot does) and some of which miss by
miles. Too much of it necessarily
covers familiar ground: too much of
it sounds like an echo of other critics'
writings, with dabs of addition or
disagreement: too much of it. using the
device of "‘Some may think” instead of
a plain “I think.” is evasive; too much
of it is woolly, meaningless or wrong.
There are occasions, such as his
studies of Furphy or William Gosse
Hay (though I doubt if it is correct to
say that Hay is “no great creator of
living characters”), when you feel that
Hadgraft has really submitted himself
to his authors —the first necessity
before you come out and criticise them
—and so has something lively, worth-
while and reasonably original to say
about them; but there are other occa-
sions—McCrae or Will Ogilvie. for
instance—when you feel that he is
wide of the mark.
He says of Ogilvie, “When he deals
with the outback he writes best, but
even then the verse has no direct
contact with what he writes of. He is
false in the same way as an historical
novelist who uses some such phrase
as: By my halidom. Sir Knight.”
There is an element of truth in this.
Ogilvie did. not altogether to his dis-
credit, paint a somewhat romantic and
chivalrous picture of the outback. But
is there “no direct contact” in that
superb ballad which Vance Palmer
liked so much, “From the Gulf”? In
“The Team Bullock.” that searing
picture of the woes of those humble
beasts, surely at least rivalling the
Lawson ballad on “The Teams” which
Hadgraft praises? No direct contact
in “How the Fire Queen Crossed the
Swamp”?—
There was Long Dick damning an
agent's eyes for his ton of extra
weight.
And Whistling Jim. for Cobb and
Co., cursing that mails were
late;
And one who blasphemed at a
broken chain and howled for a
blacksmith's blood.
And most of them cursed their
crimson luck and all of them
cursed the flood.
If I look through my notes on this
book (enlivened. I see. with a remark-
able array of outraged exelamation-
marks) I find that it is chiefly when
he is dealing with poetry that Had-
graft excites my punctuation: with
such extraordinary statements as that
“there is nothing characteristically
Australian" in Harpur's “Midsummer
Noon in the Australian Forest”: that
Paterson should not be regarded as a
poet but as “an historical document”
(why not as a baliadist?): that McCrae
was “oddly lacking" in “aural
imagery" (I am not quite sure what
Hadgraft means by “aural imagery”—
an image should be something one
sees, and you don't see with your ears
—but if he means “verbal music” he
should read “Colombine” again): that
A. G. Stephens, whose interests ranged
from Brennan to Paterson, from Ne.il-
son to Henry Lawson, “practically
determined what sort of poetry should
be written” —:no wonder, if that was
the case, that “some may think" his
influence here “was not completely for
the best": that Francis Webb's “A
Drum for Ben Boyd" is written in “a
sort of blank verse, but looser than
the normal, verging upon vers libre”—
none of it verges upon vers libre.
and some of it is in regular rhymed
stanzas: that in A. D. Hope, of whose

"A PARTY IN LABOR"
TF the Australian Federal Labor
A Party needs consolation it can
comfort itself by the fact that it is not
alone in adversity.
With almost every main plank in
its platform a matter of dispute, with
its White Australia principles dead,
its “anti-capitalist” policy operated
largely by capitalists, and its anti-
monopolist policy no bar to participa-
tion by members of the liquor trade
and the like in its caucus, it is barely
a jump ahead of the British Labor
Party in solving its problems.
While the Australian party was
plunged in strife because of its late
leadership’s Leftism, the British party,
or the more dynamic part of it, suffers
from the other extreme of viewpoint in
its Mr. Gaitskell, whose moderation
has been carried so far that a large
section of its Left wing will have none
of it.
The electors have great difficulty 'in
distinguishing its policy from that of
the Liberals, who are so near to the
Conservatives that at one of the recent
by-elections there was a joint Tory-
Liberal endorsement.
Mr. Gaitskell has never been a very
acceptable leader for a party which has
run the gamut of militancy from Keir
Hardie to Nye Bevan.
Like Mr. Attlee before him. his
experience of Labor problems has been
intellectual. He is the son of a member
of the supposedly aristocratic and
“colonialist” Indian Civil Service of
yore, educated at Winchester and
New College, Oxford, brother of
Arthur Gaitskell, manager of the Sudan
Plantations Company and chairman
of the Sudan Gezira Board, which was
a manifestation of the kind of “colonial-
ism” to which Labor is supposedly
allergic.
Labor scarcely can be comfortable
with a leader whose accent is the
accent of Winchester, who can never
forget the school motto of “manners
makyth man” in the rough and tumble
of politics, and who, if he wore the
Soviet flag with hammers and sickles
all over it as a scarf, would make it
look like the original old school tie
of Labor derision.
Mr. Gaitskell has “enjoyed” the
leadership of the party for the past few
years mainly for three reasons. Firstly,
the Right and Left wings were so
divided that they could not have
agreed on any other leader. Secondly,
because the back-room boys of the
party felt that he might attract the
intellectual long-haired parlor-pink
vote, which was their main hope of
winning an election. Thirdly, because
Nye Bevan was prepared to back him
for the same reason that E. J. Ward
was prepared to back both Dr. Evatt
and Arthur Calwell.
Meantime, he was prepared to
support a weak man and get his objec-
tives by forced compromises and the
control of party finances.
The overwhelming defeat of Labor
at the general election has set various
forces in ferment. There was a definite
move to oust the leader and an equally
definite one from the leadership to
modernise Labor policy and abandon
the ancient shibboleths which pros-
perity has made ridiculous as part of
its fighting platform.
It was made clearer by the election,
if it was not already clear, that Labor
in Britain, as in Australia, has lost its
purpose, and that there are no more
downtrodden toilers to protect, but
only huge pressure-group unions who
buy large numbers of tame intellectuals
to represent them in the party, and a
group of Leftists, most of them of
foreign origin, clustered round a few
discouraged and lily-handed standard-
bearers of the old regime.
A/fR. BEVAN, while he remained
Treasurer of the party and its most
dynamic force, kept the whole thing in
one piece while he changed his Red
shirt and socks unobtrusively prepara-
tory to taking-over, but his severe
illness has put him out of the running,
and his resignation of the party
treasurership a few days ago seems to
mark the end of his political career.
This move followed a series of events
that are ominous for Labor.
The outcome is that Labor’s own
friends are jeering at it, and even the
“Daily Mirror,” with its huge circula-
tion among the mob, referred to it
after the Brighouse by-election defeat
as “not a Labor party, but a party in
labor.” So it is, without the hope of
giving birth to anything but further
ruin.
Its leader, attributing its loss of the
election to its obsession with socialisa-
tion, has virtually taken to the boats
and abandoned the wreck- of policy on
which the old-time party floated.
His attitude has been tantamount to
an admission that the party could gain
office only with the help of the middle-
class floating vote.
Mr. Gaitskell has shown himself
feeble in his advocacy of his plan to
ditch the nationalisation plank, which
has been in the platform since the end
of World War I. and has accepted a
pale compromise of his own plan which
sticks to the old guns in effect, though
camouflaging them, and after the
manner of Australian Labor in 1950
and professing to admit that “both
public and private enterprise have a
place in the economy.”
Worse than the patched-up peace on
this issue is the division on the nuclear
bomb. Over 40 members of the caucus
have plumped for unilateral renuncia-
tion by the United Kingdom of nuclear
defence, and 21 of them actually voted
in the Commons the other day against
even the establishment of radar-
detection stations, with others of their
fellow Opposition-benchers opposing
them.
'THIS dispute has cost the Shadow
Cabinet of Labor the services of
Richard Crossman, one of Mr. Gait-
skell’s fellow-wearers of the old school
tie, another product of Winchester and
New College, Oxford, and like Mr.
Gaitskell, a former university don.
Mr. Macmillan has referred sadly to
the “folly, confusion and incompet-
ence of our opponents.” regretting it
and Labor’s desperate opportunism at
a time when it is vitally necessary on
the eve of the Summit Conference to
have a united nation on foreign issues
and those of defence.
And Mr. lain Macleod, Secretary
for the Colonies, who should have most
to fear from them, when Labor had
run a bad third to the Tories and
Liberals in Harrow after losing in
Brighouse and Spenborough in York-
shire, summed-up the position by say-
ing that Labor was “tearing itself
apart”; that “we are now a Govern-
ment without an Opposition, and,
although that may be easier for us, it
is not a healthy state of affairs.”
His dictum that “Labor cannot now
win with Mr. Gaitskell and cannot win
without him,” and that it would take
years to “turn Labor from a pressure-
group into a political party,” seems to
be borne out by facts.
What is happening in the United
Kingdom is also happening here, as
shown by the events in the N.S.W. Par-
liament, typified by the defeat of
Labor’s numerous candidates by rebels
at the Legislative Council by-election,
and by the volcanic rumblings of the
unhappy gaggle of quarrelling careerists
which calls itself an Opposition in
Canberra.


"I SEE THEY'VE STARTED PICKING ON YOU NOW. MATE!”


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Defence Scheme
The statement of Athol Townley, Minis-
ter for Defence, clears-up any doubt
about Government outlook and policy
on defence.
Whether its aims are right or wrong,
the new plan represents a genuine
attempt at modernisation and integra-
tion with the Allied Western forces of
the Pacific.
The Government believes:
(1) That because of the nuclear deterrent
the outbreak of limited or local wars is
more likely than global or full-scale war.
(2) That defence must be considered in
relation to priorities for development
through schemes such as the Snowy River
scheme, improvement of communications
and ds every of oil, plus immigration.
These schemes, by building population
and wealth, contribute to future expan-
sion of defence potential.
(3) In a position in which it is not
possible to prepare for all contingencies,
because of lack of money and man-
power, priority must go to meeting the
most likely kind of threat and to pro-
ducing means to co-operate with other
forces and to act swiftly against limited
threats of invasion, while forming a basis
on which our share in a full-scale global
war could be built.
The defence plan is therefore devised
within a framework of collective security
and the assurance that anybody who
wishes to win a war in the Pacific and
Indian Oceans for the West must make
Australia a primary base. Thus Aus-
tralian defence has become part of a
joint Western responsibility.
In the circumstances the roles of the
three services, which will inevitably
merge within a few years, need readjust-
ment. The Fleet Air Arm is virtually
worn-out —it will be completely obsolete
in 1963 and with no aircraft-carrier
capable of launching newer types avail-
able, it must go. The solid earth is a
better gun-platform, having regard to
new ranges and time-factors.
For the new Naval programme to
meet the threat of the missile-submarine,
the time is not ripe for decision, beyond
that to continue the building of deter-
rent frigates under the present pro-
gramme.
With a basic pool of 200,000 men in
reserve provided by national training and
a new strategic situation and a new scale
of costs of armament, equipment and
pay, the Government has had the choice
of trying to do one thing with the Army,
well or several things imperfectly.
It has plumped for a Regular force
increased in numbers by 33 per cent.,
reduction of administrative support
forces, intensified logistic support by air,
land and sea, and a Citizen Military
cadre of volunteers partly for officer-,
non-com.- and specialist-training, more
modernly equipped than the present force
and numbering 30,000. Their training
will be integrated with that of the
Regulars in a framework marked by
flexibility and mobility represented by the
pentropic division of five large battle-
groups.
The R.A.A.F. plans are more or less
in the melting-pot—it has 540 aircraft,
of which 400 have been Australian-
produced, but their roles are passing with
the development of missile techniques
and detection methods. The increasing
cost of both craft and training, and the
ephemeral nature of the usefulness of
manpower which can fly modern jets, are
a real Treasury headache.
All that is being done, however, is
against the background of Woomera and
its place in the structure of British
Commonwealth and Western defence.
Australian Universities
The plan to merge the Australian
National University and Canberra Uni-
versity College, which is a college of
Melbourne University, was embodied in
legislation introduced in the • Federal
Parliament last week. It is long overdue.
A university which does not teach is
no university. . The Australian National
University from the first had the air of
a college of fellows which had become
adrift and had been marooned in the
wilderness.
Beside these drifting rafts full of adult
students engaged on projects of little
value are enterprises in research, huge
by Australian standards of magnitude,
but not huge enough to keep themselves
from being outdistanced in the Grand
National race of the nuclear scientists
abroad with their superior facilities, both
technological and for co-operation and
consultation with other groups.
The conception of the A.N.U. origin-
ally was ambitious, but, like that of
the N.S.W. University of Technology,
amateurish and imperfect and bound to
fail in its existing form.
Canberra University College had a
shipwrecked appearance, as well as the
A.N.U. It was a college of a University
of which the headquarters was lodged
several hundred miles away in Victoria,
itself set down in quarters which first
of all were in the central shopping
building and then in a jerry-built accre-
tion of gloomy halls with a purely
coincidental resemblance to a Russian
slave-camp—temporary, hidden in tall
timber and minus almost everything that
a university college should have, in-
cluding beauty.
It has had the luck to absorb some
fine scholars into its staff, including
some Orientalists of world-wide reputa-
tion. Its marriage to the A.N.U., which
had become inevitable and in some
faculties has come about by a natural
process due to association, will be good
for both, but how good depends on the
way in which the policy of the new
university is developed.
The conception of the National Uni-
versity is that it shall form a home for
the very best brains of the Common-
wealth and become a Mecca also for
scholars from outside the country. The
conception of Canberra University Col-
lege was that it should provide a standard
university education for the people of
Canberra and district, particularly the
large accretion of sons and daughters of
civil servants.
With the ability available at the Aus-
tralian National University applied to
the students of the Canberra University
the product of the merger should be
something more than an ordinary run-of-
the-mill university.
Princeton seems to suggest an appro-
priate model—a university with a world-
wide reputation, which welcomes, and
has the facilities to provide a haven for,
the Einsteins of the world who are proud
to come to it and whose select student
body numbers about 3500, with over 550
professors and instructors.
South Africa and U.N.
Whatever the situation in South Africa
(and few seem to know exactly what it
amounts to), the intervention of the
Security Council of the United Nations
on the initiative of the Afro-Asian group
of members will do little to mend it.
As usual, it was moved for by an insig-
nificant Caribbean republic this time
Ecuador.
A good many of those involved have
more guilt for racial discrimination than
ever the South African Government had,
but that is forgotten by the originators
of the spate of Leftist propaganda which
is always the match which starts the fire
in these matters.
With the United States, international
affairs are always a matter of politics,
and one can take it, in view of their own
problems, that the enthusiasm of its
leaders in U.N. to condemn the South
African Government has been heightened
considerably by a side-glance toward the
negro vote which will be exercised in
this year’s Presidential elections.
There is a natural antipathy in all free
white countries to racial discrimination
accompanied by cruelty and suppression,
but the spectacle of the Russians, the
Egyptians, the Irakians and some others
of the same kidney from the Middle
East solemnly and righteously frothing
at the mouth over the matter is not
impressive. Who in either Asia or
Africa became indignant over the
Soviet Union’s murders in Hungary, or
at the ghastly loss of lives that marked
the bloody racial and religious pogroms
along the Indian-Pakistan border when
the two Indian nations achieved their
freedom and separation?
The British and Australian Govern-
ments have taken the proper stand. What-
ever their own opinions of South African
policy, they recognise the current events
as a domestic affair in which they have
no right to interfere.
U.N. has no more reason to interfere
than it would have in Russia’s dealings
with some of its own subjects.
The British and the French, both of
whom have the power of veto in the
Security Council, merely dissociated them-
selves from U.N. action by abstaining
from voting for the motion which called
on the Union of South Africa to abandon


policies of apartheid and racial discrim-
ination and gave Mr. Hammarskjold
authority “in consultation with the Gov-
ernment of the Union of South Africa to
make such arrangements as would help
uphold the purposes and of the
U.N. charter” ; in other words, to attempt
to meddle in a situation in which it only
needs a few ill-advised or ill-informed
words of urging to produce wholesale
massacre. Some of those involved in
the U.N. would be delighted to see the
white races or any part of the British
Commonwealth overwhelmed.
But the situation at present is that if
Government were to break down in the
Union, there is nothing in native leader-
ship to take its place and no alternative
to the maintenance of law and order as
represented by the forces of the Union.
Report on Adelaide
(From “D.S.”]
One of the most impressive things 1
saw in the Adelaide Festival happened
in Sydney. That was one night, just
before the Festival opened, when I went
down to No. 4 Darling Harbor and saw
a whole shipload of Sydney business-
girls floating off to it.
Everybody knew, of course, that the
Festival would be a great thing for the
people of Adelaide ; but the question
was, could it ever be anything like the
Edinburgh Festival? Would people from
all over Australia go to it? For Mel-
bourne people it was easy enough. But
Sydney?
That shipload of business-girls made
it seem just possible. Everybody means
to go to Adelaide some time, as to
Perth, Hobart or Brisbane. The Festival
provided the excuse, the motive, the
point of decision. A lot of the girls
were making it their annual holiday and,
having soaked themselves in culture and
Adelaide’s harsh clear sunshine, were
going to do a heroic return-journey by
motor-coach.
Was the effort worth making?
Two things, amidst the incessant
barrage of culture and goodwill, stand
out in my mind as supremely worth-
while. One was the exhibition of Hans
Heysen’s watercolors in the lovely old
German township of Hahndorf ; and the
other was Hugh Hunt’s production of
“Murder in the Cathedral.”
There, ' out at Hahndorf, was
Adelaide’s own Old Master ; his gum-
trees, his astonishing turkeys, his cows
under gentle willows and his rolling rock
and light from the Flinders Ranges
hanging serenely on the walls of the
oldest Lutheran school in Australia.
Except for one exceptionally delicate
watercolor of gumtrees half-lost in mist
it wasn’t exactly news to anyone who
knows Heysen ; but it was beautiful in
its setting and in its unostentatious
presentation ; and if Adelaide was going
to have a successful Festival, obviously
it should have something first-class of
its own to offer, as it did here.
But also, if it is to follow the Edin-
burgh model, a festival needs something
first-class from visiting artists ; and that
it certainly got in the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust’s “Murder in the
Cathedral.”
Eliot’s play doesn’t really hold to-
gether very well as a play. He never
will state straight-out exactly why Becket
is staying in Canterbury to be martyred
so that there is neither a satisfying
drama nor a satisfying essay on martyr-
dom. What it needs is that the knights,
who come in right at the end to argue
the thing out with Becket, should come
in at the start ; and that it should then
be made absolutely clear what Becket’s
motives are.
But it is a magnificent piece of writing,
as rich in language as it is in rhythm ;
it holds as a curiosity and a spectacle ;
and, with the producer making full use
of the advantages of the superb Bony-
thon Hall, with Robert Speaight wholly
at ease in the lead and with excellent
support from the Australian actors play-
ing the various tempters, knights, monks
and cathedral-sweepers, take it all round
it is as fine a production of this play
as you could ever hope to see. In fact,
by a pleasing coincidence, partly of the
setting, partly of the performance, the
nearest thing I have seen to it was a
production of “Macbeth” in the awe-
inspiring Presbyterian Assembly Hall-

Airline Trouble
[From Canberra]
A headache looming-up for the Govern-
ment, and for Civil Aviation Minister
Shane Paltridge in particular, is the
problem of Australia’s internal airlines.
The Labor Opposition is at present
preparing for an all-out assault on the
Government when Parliament resumes
after the Easter recess.
In a two-pronged attack, Labor will
(a) demand to know who made the final
decision that both T.A.A. and Ansett
should acquire Electra aircraft; and
( b ) when is the Government going to
do something to clip Ansett’s wings.
The Opposition has always been
against the Government’s support of
Reg. Ansett since he took over A.N.A.,
but now a large number of the Govern-
ment’s own members are getting worried
about the local Melbourne boy who made
good.
His latest move, a letter to large
private companies soliciting airline
patronage on the grounds that private
enterprise must stick together, has shaken
some of the most liberal of the Liberals.
In the letter he seeks the “active” sup-
port of private companies, speaks of
“the evils of socialism,” and asks busi-
ness-leaders how their own business
would fare if they were forced to fight
a “privileged competitor” with the
wealth and power and influence of the
Government behind it.
He omits from the letter, however, that
his own company has had £9 million of
Government backing and that the
Government refused the “privileged”
T.A.A. permission to purchase Caravelle
pure jets and forced it to take Electras —
an aircraft it did not want.
The Government wasn’t worried, and
still isn’t, by the thought of a Labor
attack, but with considerable feeling
against Ansett in its own camp, Cabinet
looks like being forced into a showdown
on the question.
The Government is too involved,
financially as well as otherwise, to ignore
the problems of the industry. It has
created a position where there are
virtually two Government-subsidised air-
lines vying with each other for the
available business.
Low Cunning in Upper House
The strange Legislative Council by-
election in which the N.S.W. Labor
party put up eight candidates against
one IndependenWnot for the purpose
of overwhelming him by weight of
numbers but solely to enable the party
bosses to keep tab on the votes of Labor
members in the “secret” ballot —resulted
in the Independent (M. T. Quinn)
winning the seat by 78 votes to 75.
Quinn’s nearest opponent, W. J.
Geraghty, scored only 11 primary votes,
but that meant nothing as his seven
running-mates were merely stooges and
all their votes would ultimately have-
come to him, provided no one dis-
regarded the how-to-vote card prepared
for him.
Penalty for such a misdemeanor was
known to be expulsion from the party,
and, according to report, Premier Heff-
ron had some embarrassing moments
just after the ballot began, when he was
observed to be fumbling in his pocket
and whispering to colleagues. The
assumption is that he had lost his in-
structions. An S.O.S. call (Save our
Secrecy!) apparently brought him a
duplicate in time to save him from
having to vote from memory.
Labor’s official strength at the com-
bined sitting was 76 and its total votes
75, so, assuming Heffron himself didn’t
go completely haywire and vote for
Quinn, it looks as though G. B. Rygate
stuck to his threat to give the Indepen-
dent his vote and risk expulsion. The
A.L.P. had no doubts on that score ; it
expelled him.
The secret-ballot farce over, the two
Houses went their separate ways and in
the Council one of the Labor rebels,
T. P. Gleeson, sought leave to bring in
a bill with the object of holding a
referendum on the abolition of the N. S.
Wales Parliament and the office of State
Governor. This was a counter to the
argument that abolition of the Legisla-
tive Council is a plank in the Labor
platform. So are the two things proposed
by Gleeson. The motion, of course, was
merely a matter of tactics ; the proposed
bill would have no chance of getting
through the Council.
Meantime Heffron is resubmitting his
bill to abolish the Council, with the
almost certain knowledge that the Coun-
cil will again toss it out. He claims he
will then go ahead with Constitutional
measures —a meeting of party-managers
and a vote at a joint-sitting of both
Houses preparatory to holding a
referendum.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Merne Chose” (France): Listening to
General de Gaulle as one of a crowd
of 15,000 outside the Narbonne Town
Hall is an experience indeed. The
General is in civilian clothes, surrounded
by members of his Cabinet and Army
officers. The mayor has at once stood
aside ; it is the General we want to hear.
Surely the tallest man in Narbonne to-
day, he speaks with clasped hands, in
a voice mostly unemotional; no gestures
until the end, no smiles, never the
slightest hesitation, never a faltered
word. He deals briefly with France’s
troubles and what he proposes to do
about them: “I, General de Gaulle,
President of the Republic.” Amid com-
plete silence we wait till he comes to
Algeria:
“We must march with the times; we are
tied, wedded to the twentieth century.
We created Algeria, we gave its people
French civilisation, we sent administrators,
soldiers, engineers, missionaries. We
opened the people’s eyes; we must now
open the gates. Algeria must not be,
cannot be, shall not be what it was.
Freely, openly and with sincerity, the
Algerians must decide.”
Before the cheering can break out he
raises his arms to form a great “V,”
and it is his voice, harsh but resonant,
that . sings the opening notes of the
Marseillaise. Then there is a surging
forward ; the police can do nothing
about it. Elderly women wearing their
husbands’ medals are reaching up to
shake the General’s hand, fathers hold
up their children so that he can touch
them; there are smiles, tears. He has
got into his car; it begins to move
slowly. The last we see, is that grave
figure, standing up bare-headed, resolute,
unsmiling; surely the greatest living
Frenchman.

“N.A.8.”: After several years con-
ducting an essay - competition among
schoolchildren on Anzac and its
message the N.S.W. branch of the
R.S.L. adopted the Kokoda Trail,
another epic of valor, for this year's
test. But how many A.I.F. men ever
went across the trail? Not a great many,
I should say. Our R.S.L. sub-branch
committee-meeting had 14 present the
other night, and not one member had
ever been on the trail. One man was
absent, and someone said he had gone
over the Kokoda Range. Is this a fair
average among ex-A.I.F. men?

feel the old saying should be revised to
go, “All’s fair in love, war and stamp-

SONG OF A SHIRT
“Sydney jockey George Mulley still wears
as a good-luck charm a tattered singlet he
has had for seven years.”
Some use the battery, pill or quirt
For wakening the dead,
But Mulley trusts his undershirt
To get his horse ahead:
One tattered singlet, it appears
Has been his luck for seven years.
The punter, on the other hand,
Cant keep a shirt or singlet
Long enough to soil the band
Much less tear or wrinkle it ;
On settling-day there are ho calls
For tattered shirts at Tattersalls.
Shirts may be safer on the track
Now Mulley’s made it known
That when he’s on the horse’s back
His shirt is on his own :
Horses are false and men untrue,
But you can put your shirt on you.

Tn response to request for TV-service
—lateral lines across the screen
on all three stations informing me that
it was on the blink —the mob I’m in-
sured with sent out next day a technician.
He switched on a perfect picture. He
took particulars of the policy, and then
broke the dread tidings: it would cost
me 30-bob for service, that being the
slug whenever they came out and found
no part had to be replaced. I countered
with the suggestion that the obvious way
to overcome this bit of piracy on the
part of the insurer was to make certain
that some part was busted. But they’d
thought of that one, too —every replaced
part had to go back to the insurance
co. for examination! He was a matey
sort of bloke, so I hauled a bottle of
beer out of the fridge and got a couple
of tall glasses. His tonsils laved by the
mellowing stingo, he agreed that Ned
had nothing on his employers, and at
the end of a half-hour session of fer-
mented liquors and fermenting thoughts
about, w'hat was by now our mutual
enemy, his eye was lit by a benevolent
gleam ; then he winked, got up, went
to the set, swung it round and pointed
to a tiny knob set in an inconspicuous
crevice. “I’m not supposed to tell you
this,” he said confidentially, “but before
you ring for service next time your
picture fades out jiggle this knob either
way, and four times out of five it’ll
come right again.” We parted amicably.
I recall that C. S. Calverley wrote a
polished ode in praise of beer: fine as
his tribute was, I doubt if it went far
enough!—“Bo.’’

his tunic he knew him for all time. Divi-
sional generals in World War II like
Moreshead, Vasey and Laverack knew
great numbers of men in their com-
mands. One cannot say the same for
General Blarney ; but our No. 1 soldier
attempted to make up for the lack of
personal contact by requesting the names
of some men in an inspecting force.
After Tobruk, when inspecting my com-
pany, he quietly asked: “Who is the
sergeant with the D.C.M.? The private
with the M.M.? The little corporal on
the end of the front row?” When
Blarney stopped in front of each of the
three mentioned and called them by
name I thought their tunics would burst

matter of: "Fancy the old so-and-so

so lucky. When inspecting a group of

"4 VERY FOUL-MOUTHED CREW OF YOUNG RAGAMUFFINS' 9
SCHOOL AT SOUTHEYS
I had been to school in
Sydney for a quarter or
two in 1874-75 —we went
by quarters, not terms —
at Mr. Stephens’, nearly oppo-
site Richmond House. My
impressions are vague and very
innocent. For instance, l
remember seeing boys made to
stand on the form; I did not
know it was a punishment and
was fascinated by the distinc-
tion, the freedom of the posi-
tion and the chance of looking
out of the window when other
boys could not. I went up to
the master and asked leave to
stand on the form, which was
not granted. Also, I once went
to school wearing a little black
beard which 1 had made out
of coconut fur, and was much
taken aback when I was sup-
posed to be impertinent. 1 had
only wanted to share a pleasant
joke with my teacher.
It was a different thing, going
to Southey's. It was away at
Moss Vale, near Nattai in the
mountains, and of course I
was to be a boarder. I talked
it over again and again with
my mother. I was miserable at
the thought of being away from
home, so she gave me half-a-
sovereign, over and above my
pocket-money, to pay my fare
home, in case 1 really wanted
to run away.
My Uncle William took me
up to Moss Vale, secured a
protector for me in the shape
of one Alister Cox. He was a
brown, stout, serious, snub-
nosed boy, about seventeen. I
supposed William tipped him;
anyhow, he never bullied me,
so l liked him.
He was not popular in the
school, chiefly because he was
a sort of rival to Charlje Lamb
and beat him easily at book-
work. Now Charlie Lamb was
the greatest of all living men.
He was tall, lithe and strong,
good with his fists, even among
stock-boys and draymen; he
could ride, at least we thought,
like a blackfellow, sit a buck-
jumper, clear a five-bar gate
bareback, gallop with his face
to the horse's tail; and he
despised that narrow world
which lies outside fists and
horses. I did not mind Lamb,
but circumstances attached me
rather to the small and undis-
tinguished band which followed
Cox.
T was of course rather anxious
J and unhappy at leaving
home; but I had a burning wish
to distinguish myself, to be
admitted as an equal among
the other boys,' which kept
other feelings down. The next
day came my first Latin lesson.
I learnt it as hard as I could,
more intently, I suppose, than
anyone else. Cox was doing
something by himself, some-
thing above our heads. I was
put bottom, as I was the newest
comer. I was greatly excited
and afraid of disgracing myself
in public. As it happened I
answered practically every
question, and got up to about
third. Then Southey reproved
[This is the second (and concluding) extract
from Sir Gilbert Murray’s “Unfinished Auto-
biography,” published last month by Allen and
Unwin, Ltd.]
me for having my hands in my
pockets. 1 took them out, but
they soon slipped back, and he
threatened to send me down
if I offended again.
Presently I got up second
and then top, and in the thrill
of the moment my hands
sought their natural resting
place. “Go down one place"
came the fatal words. 1 felt
as if I was struck and went
down feeling rather blind. 1
kept the hands carefully clasped
in front of me. My thought
was more of them than of the
Latin Grammar. At last the
two top boys missed a question:
T knew it, and went up top
again. In the intense relief
and satisfaction of the moment
I forgot the hands, and in they
went again to my trouser
pockets. Almost before I had
walked up top, I was told to
go down again and warned that
if I offended again I should go
bottom. I had kept back my
tears before, but now they
broke out.
I went down second, and
Lamb, who was third, laughed
at me. This was too much;
I felt that life was of no value
to me any longer, rushed on
him and hit him in the stomach.
I do not know quite what he
did to me; I remember vague
and awful threats, and Southey
telling him not to hit me, while
I called on him to do his worst.
The lesson was over almost
immediately. Southey for
which I am still grateful—-
reproved me very gently, and
apparently told Lamb he must
not take the full vengeance his
dignity required. I do not
think he punished me at all,
though others did.
Tn the matter of bullying
Southey's was, I should guess,
at about the same stage as
English schools about a half-
century earlier. I am afraid
the truth is that a mob of boys,
when they have nothing par-
ticular to do, can always amuse
themselves by bullying small
boys and tormenting animals.
Organised games, whatever
may be said against them, have
humanised English schools a
great deal. But certainly at
that time, when there were
only ten or twelve boys and
some pretty bad influences at
work among them. Southey's
must have been a rather un-
wholesome place. 1 do not
quite know what anyone did
or said to me, but at the end
of that day I was wild with
rage and crying, and would
have given all my worldly
goods for the pleasure of
murdering H.
Next day came my first
fight; I had six fights that
quarter. It was partly Lamb
and partly the stable-man who
brought it about. They wanted
to see some fun or other, and
a fight between two kids sug-
gested itself as appropriate. I
was asked if I was “afraid of
Goodenough”; I was not.
“Then fight him,” said the
stable-man.
I was full of certain home
principles, and would not fight
without a cause. This amused
them, so they set to work to
provide a cause. A small boy
called Punch Osborne was
made to cheek Goodenough;
then Goodenough licked him.
Then I was told Goodenough
was bullying Osborne and that
1 ought to stop it. Accordingly
I challenged Goodenough, and
we had our fight in a corner
where the red-brick orchard-
wall joined the whitewashed
kitchen-wall at the back of the
house near the path down to
the stables. Goodenough held
up his head better than I did
—well might he do so, since he
was destined to become Sir
William, but J beat him all the
same. I was glad 1 beat him;
though, on looking back from
now on the whole transaction,
1 am sure that Osborne deserved
what he got and more also; but
1 really fought for the sake of
public opinion.
T felt the misery of being des-
A pised, of being peculiar and
not standardised, so keenly; I
would have sold my soul for
its blessed opposite—and in-
deed I did so to some extent.
The first thing I thought need-
ful was to be always ready to
fight anyone of my size or a
little bigger, then to be good
at games if I could manage it,
and as far as possible to be
like everyone else. 1 fought
Goodenough again that quar-
ter; I.fought little Osborne and
of course beat him; and three
times I fought Gowland. Gow-
land was a little bigger than
I, and he came in with his right
in a most disconcerting way.
1 fought him at first at the
stables, and began by getting
rather the best of it. He hit
much harder than Goodenough,
so the fight was more serious
on both sides. At last, I
remember. I caught him a great
smasher on the nose and felt
it soften up in that curious way
noses have, under my fist.
Somehow when I felt that and
saw his nose bleeding I lost
heart. We had our second in
the dormitory at night, a few
days after, and our third down
at the stables. He knocked
me into a cocked-hat that
time, and J admitted “afraid of
Gowland” afterwards.
In spite of all this I was very
unhappy. I was good at my
lessons, but they seemed such
a smalt part of life and the
province ruled by H. and the
stable-man such a huge one.
Poor H. I tried to befriend
him afterwards, at Mittagong,
when he was badly bullied him-
self and went half-daft over it.
But at this time he was a cruel,
foul-mouthed fellow, only sur-
passed by the stable-man, who
was a real blackguard.
I remember how he put H.
up against a wall and threw
stones at him; I forget how H.
had annoyed him, but he
stoned him pretty soundly and,
as a parting stroke, called on
all the little boys to “shy a

POLITICAL POINTS
CJouth Africa’s policy of apartheid
goes dead against the trend of events
throughout the rest of Africa, ignoring
what British Prime Minister Macmillan
called —in South Africa’s own Parlia-
ment “the winds of change.” But
for the present, resolutions by the
United Nations condemning the policy
are more likely to strengthen than
shake the Verwoerd Government’s deter-
mination to persist with it. This view
is supported by the reaction of the
United party, the Opposition in the South
African Parliament, to the Security
Council resolution. Opposition-leader
Sir Villiers de Graaf, while demanding
an inquiry into the causes of the riots
and shootings and urging a new deal for
Africans, has also called for unity among
South Africans in asserting their right to
settle their own affairs without outside
interference.

The New England New State Move-
ment has decided to ask for a referendum
on its objective on the same day as the
referendum on abolition of the N. S.
Wales Legislative Council. Surely they
won’t be content to wait as long as that?
• •
Real reason for Paul Hasluck’s
accompanying the Prime Minister abroad
could be the suggestion that Indonesia
may raise the West New Guinea issue
once more in the U.N. this year, and
that Hasluck, as Minister for Territories,
wants to spend some time in discussions
with the Dutch on the recent moves, not
always completely in harmony as be-
tween Australia and Holland, on the
development and future of both ends
of the huge island.

Khrushchev left France loaded down
with gifts of wine and with the assurance
given for the umpteenth time that if the
West doesn’t adopt his plan to swallow
Berlin he will make a “peace treaty” with
East Germany, which would render all
occupation rights in Berlin null and void,
and East Germany the “sovereign Power”
over all territory east of the Elbe. Under
such a treaty, East Germany would be
about as sovereign as the canary the cat
ate, and West Berlin could be turned
into part of it only at the expense of
a new Hungary of 1956.

G. B. Rygate, M.L.C., has been expelled
from the Labor party for voting against
the party-ticket in a secret ballot to elect
a new M.L.C. Like the ballot, his expul-
sion is no secret.
Bill Wentworth’s advocacy of relief
from taxation for part-time volunteer
servicemen had justice behind it. When
young men give-up their time for the
miserable pittance they receive for
parades and camps it is shocking that
they should be penalised under a taxa-
tion-system which allows the deduction
of wine-bills and theatre-tickets as a
business expense.

Reported from Moscow that Bulganin
has been allowed to come back to
Moscow and live on a pension about
equal to that of a retired Government

they are. Malenkov appears to have dis-
integrated altogether.

A nother monster N.S.W. art-union
has had to close very much under-
subscribed ; it aimed at selling 980,000
tickets at ss. each, but the total sold,
after two extensions of time, was
“fewer than 570,000.” The fact is that
the promoters of these scarcely-disguised
lotteries have become too greedy and
try to grab in one fell swoop what they
were formerly grateful to garner in rela-
tively small sums over a long period.
Even the N. S. Wales gambling public,
indoctrinated as they are by the easy-
money lure of Government lotteries, have
only so much to “invest.” With churches,
clubs and committees offering cars and
cottages for a bob a ticket the sucker-
market has become saturated.
T>y-elections next Saturday aren’t likely
to change party-strengths in the
House of Representatives. In Hunter
(N.S.W.), A. W. James, son of Rowley,
can be expected to get the usual massive
majority the coalfields seat has given
Labor for half-a-century. In Latrobe,
Casey’s former seat, the Liberal candi-
date John Jess seems safe enough.
Despite the professed optimism of Cal-
well and Whitlam, who predict a Labor
victory, it may not even be necessary to
count the preferences of the D.L.P. and
Republican candidates.

Fremantle is likely to be the base for
a big international programme of oceanic
research in the Indian Ocean by ships

are scheduled to begin late in 1961,
reach a peak in 1963, and finish in 1964.
H.M.A.S. Diamantina has already made

The latest wanderer among rulers is

THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA


Tom Lehrer, after some of his songs
had been banned in Adelaide, scored
a few good points over the S.A. censor-
ing authorities. Best of them was when
he told his audience that the forbidden
records could be bought under the
counter at a shop “not four churches
away,” and that he understood that on
Tuesday nights the same shop was “the
scene of illicit wine-tasting.”

The remarkable unity of Helfron
Labor was again demonstrated in the
N. S. Wales Assembly when Housing
Minister Landa said he was in favor
of allowing automatic petrol-vending
machines to operate outside ordinary
service-station hours. Government policy
in N. S. Wales prohibits these machines,
largely at the insistence of Minister for
Labor and Industry J. J. Maloney. That
Minister is in the Legislative Council
and he is represented in the House of
Assembly by—Abe Landa.

“C.S.”: Lib. and Lab. are given their
heads to state their views in a weekly
column in Melbourne “Herald,” with
the smaller C.P. and D.L.P. given com-
parative space. The Liberal column is
sound, the D.L.P. often so, the C.P.
edgy and parochial, but the A.L.P. really
goes to town and appears to be written
by bitter old men or headstrong youths.
A recent effort suggested that the
Prime Minister didn't care about a dead
South African native here and there,
that there might be a bond between
some Liberal members in Australia and
the South African murderers, and that
Australian workers were suppressed not
by police guns but by the refined
machinery of the Arbitration Court. The
“Herald” was moved to a pained editorial
rebuking its wild contributors.

de Gaulle and Adenauer. In Australia
Barton, Deakin, Reid, W. M. Hughes

Soekarno’s new “Parliament,” to re-
place the elected house which he dis-
solved on March 5, will consist of 261
members of whom 131 will belong to
“functional groups”—the Army and
other hangers-on of the President, who
can be relied on to vote the right way.
The remainder are cunningly divided
between “reliable” parties which are
strong enough to see that they are not
ignored. The National party has 44
seats, the Orthodox Muslims 36, and
the Communists 30. The un-co-operative
Masjumi Moslems, one of the great
parties, disappears. And there will be
no free elections before 1962. Mean-
time some mean electors have been
trying to kidnap Commander-in-Chief
Nasution, who is the real controller of
Indonesia if it comes to a showdown.

“Mugga Way”: The Australian War
Memorial in Canberra is a treasure-house
of mementoes, but the wish of the trustees
that it should contain an honor-roll of
those who died for their country has
long awaited fulfilment. A contract has
now been let for the casting on bronze
panels of 61,521 names, and these will be
erected on the western wall of the court-
yard, alongside the Pool of Remembrance.
Names only will appear, without ranks
or decorations, and the panels will list
names of all who fell in the Sudan war,
the Boxer rebellion, the Boer war and
World War I. When the later wars are
added —World War 11, Korea and
Malaya—the panels will bear more than
104,000 names —a record of an immense
sacrifice by a young nation and its youth.

On the one hand his Local Govern-
ment Minister Hills has turned-down
proposals for a tunnel under Sydney
Harbor on the grounds that it would
cost too much. On the other his Rail-

fire for allegedly intending to grant a
lease of the disused Wynyard tram-
tunnel too cheaply. Obvious solution
seems to be to shift the tram-tunnel and
put it under the Harbor.

Alvin Jehu, the Jehovah's Witness
whose two-day-old baby died after Jehu
had refused on religious grounds to
consent to a blood - transfusion, was
found guilty of manslaughter by a Mel-
bourne jury and released on a bond,
but a day later he said he might appeal,
and Attorney-General -Rylah began
seriously to examine the jury’s recom-
mendation to give hospitals and the
medical profession authority to give
blood-transfusions to save lives.
Some Australian States already have
legislated on these lines —the N. S. Wales
Parliament has a bill before it at present
—but there is strong opposition to the
principle in Britain, led by two of Fleet
Street’s most responsible newspapers, the
“Daily Mail” and “Times.”

Argument over full political rights for
N. S. Wales police show the absurdity
of compulsory voting. It is certainly
against public policy that police should
penly take political sides, and they are
discouraged from doing so by being
forced to resign and forfeit their rights
if they stand for Parliament as in the
case of Rowley James’s detective son.
Yet they are compelled to vote.

TV[o dissentients voted against the over-
due bill to enliven Anzac Day in
Victoria with sport and entertainment
in the afternoon. Although there were
some opponents among Lib. and C.P.
members, they did not record their
opposition, in deference to the big R.S.L.
vote for it.
Former Speaker Sir George Knox
made a sincere, and, at times, moving
speech against alteration, but the chief
point of it seemed to be a lament that
_ the form of observance was changed
before the last veteran of World War 1
died.

Harold Richter, president of the
Queensland Country party, told members
at their annual conference that Govern-
ment candidates had little to fear from
Labor at the coming election but that
the greatest danger lay in Independents
who tacked “Country party” or “Liberal”
on to their Independent label, and
attracted votes away from the endorsed
Government candidates.
That’s one of the weaknesses of the
first-past-the-post system. The Nicklin
Government has had the chance to
abolish it but hasn’t done so, possibly
feeling that it has its advantages while
there are two Labor parties in Queens-
land politics. If that is the reason then
the policy is a shortsighted one.

The sudden urgency of people like
Leslie Haylen about Australian defence
must bewilder friends in Peking and
Moscow in the light of the fact that
their international view has long seemed

confused, since their Australian advocate
in his recent book on China seemed to
do some of his thinking in the exact
verbiage of their own propagandists.

[From Canberra]
For the second year in succession the Snowy
Mountains Scheme looks like running out o£
money. Work has been progressing at such
a rate, with new records being made almost
monthly, that the year’s allocation of £2sf-
million may be exhausted within a few weeks.
The same thing happened last year, and to
maintain a continuity of work Cabinet
authorised an additional £4-million between
March and June.
Not quite so much will be needed this year;
National Development Minister Spooner has
asked Cabinet for an additional £2-million.
Cabinet is certain to o.k. the request as it
regards the Snowy project as probably the
most important undertaking in Australia at
present.
The soonef thd scheme is completed the
better for the Government, as it will be a big
money-spinner once it is in full operation.
Already it is providing the Commonwealth with
£4-million a year in revenue from the sale of
electricity .to the N.S.W. Electricity Commission.
Three-million of this is earned by Tl, the first
of six underground power-stations; T 2 will
probably be in operation later this year.

I, winning the M.C. and Bar. He served
with the R.A.F. from 1918 to 1923,
left it for journalism and business, was
elected M.P. in 1929, and became
Parliamentary Under-secretary of State
for the Air (1938-44) and Minister
Resident in West Africa (1944-45). He

on Sir Dallas Brooks an honorary
Doctorate of Laws, not simply because he

a forceful leader who has “inspired in
the people of Victoria a real sense of

more appropriate. His English is notable,
and his speeches out of the top drawer.
They are pungent but civilised, brief but

a homespun philosopher who scandalised
some people by welcoming the State

neither collar nor tie beneath his
patriarchal beard. John Missingham was
the softest-spoken ex-bullocky 1 ever met,
and the days I spent with him at the
Pheasant Ground polling-booth —he
returning-officer, and I poll-clerk, with
about 25 votes to record in a day—were
about the most rewarding I ever spent,

Highest honor awarded by the Aus-

has been bestowed on Dr. Donald O.
Norris, the Australian Medal of Agri-

research-officer in the C.5.1.R.0., gained
international recognition for his work
on plant viruses, and his current research
may lead to more successful development
of agriculture and stock-raising in the
tropics, particularly if he discovers how
such legumes as clovers could be made
to grow well in sub-tropical and tropical
pastures.

Maitland (N.S.W.) Show has had only
10 presidents during 100 years. The

W. E. Sparke, took-up the running in
1932 and is still in office. Longest in-
cumbent, however, was Samuel Clift
(1883-1913), owner of Breeza station and
a breeder of racehorses. Sir William
Denison (Governor-General of N.S.W.,
as his office was then titled) was first
president. He was elected in October,
1859, and held the post until appointed
Governor of Madras in ’6l. Other presi-

clashes with Gloaming were epics),
Charles Reynolds, J. Docker, J. Wynd-

Charles O'Malley, who has been build-
ing bridges in Victoria for most of his
life, steps up a span to become chief
civil engineer and port-officer of the
Public Works Department. He had a
big hand in putting up the Spencer Street,
Hawthorn, Victoria and Grange Road
bridges in Melbourne, and before that
across the Murray at Robinvale-Euston
(where he says everybody reads The
Bulletin and, he suspects, many
Bulletin characters come from) and
at Yarrawonga.
He is also responsible for the struc-
tural work on many Government-owned
buildings, others at the University and
for swamp-drainage works throughout
Victoria.
Like most engineers, Charles O’Malley
is a forthcoming fellow, and the day his
appointment was announced he was
aiming a spanner, in evidence as presi-
dent of the Marine Board, before the
Melbourne Fish Inquiry, at fishermen
who won't paint and grease the expen-
sive port-installations put in chiefly for
their use.
Short and dynamic, Walter Vincent
Burns, managing-director of Angus and
Robertson, first came to Australia from
his native Maoriland 31 years ago. He’s
had a pretty varied and exhilarating life.
Starting with Whitcombe and Tombs, he
fairly soon transferred to Leightons and
then set-up an import-and-export busi-
ness of his own in Auckland. With con-
nections in N.Z., Australia and America
ffe had to do a lot of travelling, and Joe
Goldberg, of pokeumachine fame, was
one of his shipboard acquaintances.
Back in N.Z., he spent some years on
the land, running sheep and cattle, and
retired in 1949 to devote more time to his
hobby of investment and his relaxations,
fishing and birdwatching. Then last

overseas sales for Australian books are
going very nicely, thank you.
Burns has brought new ideas and
fast-moving methods to A. and R.'s,
especially to its Halstead Press, the print-
ing and bookbinding offshoot. He is
always on the ball, and makes a practice
of conferring with his staff and with

medical research at the R.N. medical
school in Hampshire. Navy Minister
John Gorton, announcing the appoint-
ment, said it was increasingly important

“Judee”: The Methodist Church at
Wallsend, on the N.S.W. northern coal-
field, has been celebrating its centenary.
The first church, built of stone, collapsed
because of mine-subsidence, so the
Newcastle-Wallsend Co. erected the pre-
sent one in Metcalfe Street. It dates from
1876, but the first Methodist service
thereabouts had been held in January,
1860, when the Rev. W. Green preached
from a tree-stump at the corner of Lake
Road and Thomas Street. John Trus-
cott, whose grandchildren are members
of the present congregation, was a
pillar of the earlier congregation, and,
being hard of hearing, always occupied
the front pew, to which ran a speaking-
tube from the pulpit. To mark the cen-
tenary the Truscott family has given the
church an electronic carillon, recently
dedicated by Dr. A. H. Wood, Metho-
dist President-General for Australia.

ABORIGINALITIES
T> eaders, particularly in the N.S.W.
Riverina country, will remember
“John O’Brien” —the Rev. P. J. Hartigan.
He always fancied a good and sporty
car. They came, as he said, not from
the plate but from the Boree Log. At the
time of which I am writing he had a 1928
Buick sports, hotted-up to his own
specifications. Before this he had
his famous Silver Alvis. His Buick had
two enclosures built into each side —both
big enough to take a large-sized Glad-
stone-bag. I accompanied him to Grong
Grong often, and thrilled at his driving-
ability and, during his sermons, his
eloquence. After one Sunday trip he
called around at night on his way to a
sick-call; he wanted company. On the
way out he remarked about a strange
smell in the car. I did notice it a little,
“Cripes ! If they're asking a thousand quid transfer-fee for YOU, I
should be Worth ten thou!
but it was nothing, I thought, to com-
plain of. “Perhaps it’s my old leather
coat, Eric —I must get a new one.” That
suited me fine, and I still treasure his old
leather coat. The following Sunday he
called again, resplendent in a brand-new
coat, and headed for Grong Grong.
“That smell is getting worse, Eric.” “I
wouldn’t think so, Father Pat —the smell
of the new leather, perhaps?” We let
it rest at that. After Mass a very loyal
parishioner approached him: “And did
you like the turkey I put in your car
last Sunday, Father?” “Put where?”
said his reverence. “In there,” said the
old dear, pointing to one of his small
doors. None of - the small gathering
could help but hear him: “Found the
bloody smell, Eric, but it cost me a
new coat and I’ve done a good turkey 1”
—“Ell-Kay.”

“Sister Ellell”: In Gotaberg (Sweden)
I saw a large street clock with hands
shaped like bananas. Any distributing-
agent up north like to copy the idea?
P’raps he could incorporate the pine
apple for the dial!
* * * *
“Djungala Tom”: Will someone tell
me what really constitutes a folksong?
“Click Go the Shears” gets fairly frequent
airing. In my schoolboy days we
irreverently used this Salvo hymn-tune
to the words: “Come to the Army, make
no delay ; back seats a deener, front
seats a trey.” Does a batch of verses of
jolly jingle with some sort of pastoral
flavor, tacked onto the above kind of
tune, really make a national folksong?
v * * *
“M’Lou”: Because its own huge Cossar
press was being transported piecemeal to
a new site in Horsham (Vic.), the
“Wimmera Mail-Times” had several
issues printed in Hamilton, 80 miles away
At the same time, when Dimboola, a
quarter the distance away, sent out an
SOS because the linotye staff there was
absent, sick, the “Mail-Times” mustered
sufficient workable machinery to print a
weekly issue of both the “Dimboola
Banner” and the “Minyip Guardian.”
* * * *
“Ager”: Farming is taking on a bit of
tone since our town’s medico took-over
a grazing-property our way. Warned his
man not to chase pregnant ewes . . .
Next thing we’ll have the buyers blushing
if the auctioneers catch onto the idea
and start offering those nice lines of preg-
nant ewes at the yards.
*** i o
“Bass”: “Tyabb” errs in thinking
that “all pardalotes invariably nest in
chambers at the end of an earth-tunnel
in a creek or other suitable bank.” The
red-tipped diamond-bird of sou'-West-
ralia ( Pardalotus substriatus ) builds a
dome-shaped nest of grasses, bark and
feathers in tree-hollows up to 50ft. above
ground; and Serventy and Wittell
instance a pair nesting in a building in
Perth. Incidentally, in any pardalote-
nests in banks I've examined the nest-
opening faced away from the tunnel-
mouth, so that the bird, or an intruder,
had to half-circle the nest to enter.
* * *
“Peanut”: Work-study groups have
been trying to improve the efficiency of
Broken Hill mines. Latest gadget is a
tandem-cycle, running on rails under-
ground, to be used to take foremen and
shift-bosses over long drives. Miners
maintain that the foreman will always
sit behind, so that his junior can’t see
when he isn’t pedalling.

T ike “D.l.F.’s” dad (B. 2/3/’6O),
vL/ Chinese women in Borneo for
coolth topped their coiffures with a
cabbage-leaf, but it also saved the bun
which stuck out through the centre hole
of the curtained rattan hat from being
bleached by the tropical sun. The
Hakka woman seemed at middle-age
often balded in front, but her hair was
always waist-length or longer. She used
only one brand of brilliantine, by a
famous Paris perfumier. Its label pictured
bees gathering flower-nectar, so she knew
it as “Oil of Insects.” The small dagger
pinning the coiled bun had to be gold,
22-carat or better. Her matched bangles
were jade of not good quality, because,
laboring, she often broke one. She
earned Is. 6d. a day and could afford
such gew-gaws. She never touched a
needle, but as a home-making wife was

much in demand by the clerical class. She
kept on working while Granny minded
the kids ; she would try to keep on the
payroll right up to childbirth. Her gang-
mates, shepherding her from heavy lifts,
always played an elaborate game of
clustering round her to deceive the white
superintendent. He finally, amid great
laughter and ribald but good-humored
protests from her co-workers, would tell
her to go home. —“Septulum.”

“Miss M.”: Refreshments for fire-
fighters (B. 9/3/’60)? When a bushfire
threatened our Army hospital all male
staff and walking-patients took beaters
and sprays in hand.
Those protecting the
canteen were regaled
by a grateful pro-
prietor with iced
lollywater hospital
canteens were “dry.”
Round the sisters’
quarters the girls
off - duty shuttled
back and forth with
gallons of tea and
scones, cakes and
other delicacies. Far
down the longxlrive-
way a lonely group
protecting the
sentry - box and
entrance-gates felt
like forgotten men —
till a ute came tear-
ing along the road
from Ye Olde Inne,
a mile or so down-
wind, laden with
firefighting equip-
ment —the sort that
comes in kegs.

“Dud”: Touching
on tea-making
recipes lately offered
here, an old Indian
soldier showed me
how to brew it as
they do it in the
hills of Ceylon. Fill
a saucepan with
water and then put in
exactly half the amount of dry tea that
would be used if making the same
quantity in a teapot. Bring slowly to the
boil and lift off immediately. Delicious!
* * * *
“Kerrie”: Allow me to put “Mack-
ville” straight regarding the wooden
knockers used by blade-shearers to silence
the click (B. 24/ 2/ ’6O). When I learned
the game the only wood used on the
shears was a round piece let into the
hollow of one handle, solely for the
purpose of attaching the business-end of
the “driver,” a leather strap which took
all the drive, or thrust, and left the hand
free to open for a full blow. The
knockers were small oblongs of leather,
bound over the heel-pieces, which came
together when the blades closed, and
clicked when not covered. Knockers were
a “must” for all blade-shearers.
T\iscussion settled on the best way to
take shade-temperature. The relative
merits of using the shade of a tree or the
back-veranda to get a true reading were
thrashed-out, and someone also opined
that if you whirled the thermometer
around at arm’s-length accuracy would
be assured. Then Joe put in his method:
Count the number of chirps of a cricket
in 15 seconds, add 40 and you get the
right temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
Reckoned you could put your wad on
it.—“O’Jai.”

“Manamoi”: Cats are famous enough
for their homing-ability, but the first
"Is that the new off-the-shoulder style, Paddy?”
pioneer-cat to settle in the N.S.W. New
England reversed the usual story. He
belonged to Mrs. Clerk, of Clerkness
station, Bundarra, and had lived quite
happily in the homestead for some
months before he disappeared. A few
days later Macpherson, owner of 30-
miles-distant Keera station, rode up to
Clerkness, and Mrs. Clerk mentioned the
loss of her pet. “So this is where he
came from,” said Macpherson. “I’d just
had a cat brought up to my place. I
knew it was the only one for miles
round, but when I went out this morning
there were two cats —mine and yours.”
The Clerkness cat had found his way
through 30 miles of unknown territory
to visit a fellow-feline he’d never seen
before, and some days later found his
way home again, to go no more a-rovin’
all the rest of his life. No prizes for
guessing the sex of the Keera cat.
“Khairy”: In an account of Western
Australia’s most colorful school —in a
cave on Go Go station in the north—
Jack Jones writes in Perth “Sunday
Times’’: “Before school starts, bats which
enter the caves during the night have to
be removed. So has the bulldust —fine,
dry dust —which blows into the school
from time to time. Once the school is
neat and clean, the schoolday begins.”
Curriculum committees in the south
should make a close study of the methods
used to remove the bats, and especially
the bulldust, from school-courses ; their
efforts up-to-date have tended to in-
crease rather than decrease their presence
in south W.A. schools.
* * * *
“Flight”: Noticed in the Service
Department a listing of the three types
of ibis in Australia—straw-necked, white
and glossy. I presume this latter is the
small variety known to bushmen as the
“black.” A peculiarity of this fellow is
his serrated bill, and he’s mostly to be
seen wading along the edge of a water-
hole. After a good season in West
Queensland the straw-neck may be in
countless thousands; they get on the
friendliest terms with humans, and
think nothing of stepping through an
open door into a house or making them-
selves at home in the garden. The straw-
neck is no beauty, but he carries himself
with an air and has a certain grace.
While he works the open downs and
patches of plain (wherever ’hoppers or
their eggs are likely to be plentiful), the
white chap sticks to waterholes and
swamps. Then an odd black (or “glossy”)
cousin appears. There’s no immediate
general exodus of the straw-necks, but
there’s a noticeable thinning of their
ranks, and within a week or so of the
black's invasion there’ll only be a rare
straw-neck where, before, they stalked in
their thousands.

Tt was a sizzling-hot day when the swag-
man, in practically the last stages of
exhaustion, turned-up at the homestead
(it was the last place on the track before
you were blocked-off by the river). He
was given a meal ; then he stretched-out
under the big pepper-tree. An hour later,
when the folk who ran the property went
down to see if he was all right, the visitor
was no longer there. Most of his pos-
sessions were, though—his roll of
blankets, his billy, and even his pipe and
tobacco. Thinking he might have col-
lapsed (they thought he was too weak
to have gone far), they toothcombed
the property and paid special attention
to the river-bed and billabongs. Meeting
with no luck, they informed the police,
who drove-out to collect the belongings
and also made a thorough search. For
months everybody in the district kept
a sharp lookout, but from the day he
staggered up to the kitchen-door nobody
has glimpsed as much as a hair of the
missing swaggie. Fifty years afterwards,
the people who lived on the place still
feel bad when they wonder what could
have happened to the poor devil. —-
“Maitri.”

DEFENCE-AND OIL
[From W. Hall, W.A.]
T support the oil-search
theory of “Old Opencut”
(B. 10/2/’6O), at least as far as
our Far North is concerned.
The Bulletin appears to be
the only non-technical journal
aware of the vital necessity of
finding oil in Australia.
Three years ago I suggested
to Senator Spooner that the
search for oil could be ex-
pedited by accepting it as a
defence measure, with access
to defence funds.
A limited subsidy has already
attracted capital from the
U.S.A., so if a well-publicised
£10,000,000 or more of defence
funds could be used to sub-
sidise oil-exploration, it would
probably attract a similar
amount in dollars, most of it
to be spent in Australia.
It may well be that Austra-
lia’s oil is hidden in variable-
porosity traps, not easy to
locate and probably requiring
many exploratory holes in the
same area. Under existing con-
ditions they would not qualify
for subsidy when stratigraphic
information had been disclosed
by the first hole drilled in the
area.
Dr. A. T. Levorsen has
pointed-out that of the 22
largest oil-pools in U.S.A.,
over half the oil-production
was obtained from pools in
which the dominant trap-
making element was a change
from porosity to non-porosity.
There was a suggestion of
this in an article by the late L.
Owen when he said that the
history of oil-exploration in
Australia was one of drilling
obvious anticlines, and it had
not been a success up to date.
Apart from security, the
search for oil is a case where
time is money—£ 130-million-
worth of it every year, and
rapidly growing. Mr. K. has
warned us that the cold war
will be replaced with one of
commercial competition, for
which a home-produced supply
of crude oil would be more
effective than a stockpile of
guided missiles.
Whilst it must be conceded
that the money spent may not
produce favorable results, it
would not be a total loss if
further overseas capital came
in to be spent in Australia.
On the other hand, success
would introduce an era of
prosperity, with wide avenues
of taxation from which expen-
diture incurred by the Govern-
ment could readily be re-
covered.
The A.P.C. Group
A nnouncement by Kandos
Cement, Ltd., and Aus-
tralian Cement, Ltd., that they
were both making one-for-five
issues at par came somewhat as
a surprise in view of a previous
statement that funds for the
new big cement plant at Kan-
dos (in the Capertee Valley,
N.S.W.) would be financed out
of internal resources.
The Kandos plant, and that
at Geelong (Vic.), are owned
by. Australian Portland Cement
Pty., in which Kandos and
Australian Cement have equal
holdings. The public capitals
of Kandos and Australian are
near enough to being equal
also, so there is no real differ-
ence between the market merits
of either share.
Apparently the call for the
new capital, which will amount
to about £565,000, all told, has
been created by the need to ex-
pand the new 450,000-ton Gee-
long plant, which has not long
been completed. Possibly the
Kandos plant will now be made
larger than originally planned,
in view of what has happened
in Victoria. The A.P.C. group
are already by far the biggest
makers of cement in the Com-
monwealth, and original plans
for the Kandos plant meant
that output there would be well
over double present capacity.
Assuming that when plant-
expansion at Geelong and
Kandos is completed total
capacity will exceed a million
tons, on a combined capital of
around £3,400,000 for the two
holding-cos., each ton of plant-
capacity would still have the
very low valuation of under
£3 10s.
Gypsum Shares
AX7Tth the shares in Australian
Gypsum, Ltd., at 555. in
Sydney, the scrip in Victor
Electric Plaster and Peninsula
Plaster at 51s. in Melbourne
look particularly good buying.
The £1 denominators in all
three cos. are virtually identical
triplets for investment pur-
poses, and there is no reason
why they should be differently
priced. The £1 shares of each
represent the same equity in
Australian Gypsum Products
Pty., the biggest Australian
gypsum enterprise, which has
been more profitable over the
years than it has admitted to,
and still seems to be in an in-
teresling financial condition,
even though it made-a one-for-
one bonus-issue only last year.
Blue-metal ancf Concrete
Tt is hard to say whether the
A acquisition of Melocco
Brothers’’ ready-mixed concrete
and quarrying interests by
Blue Metal Industries, Ltd.
(for 1,583,016 Blue Metal ss.
shares and £58,790 cash),
represents diversification or
consolidation. Probably “con-
solidation” is the more apt
word, even though it has been
accompanied by a statement
by Blue Metal directors that
the “steps have been taken in
accordance with a policy of
diversification of interests and
in order to assist in the
orderly marketing of quarry
products.” These steps include
negotiations with Ready Mixed
Concrete, Ltd., the biggest in
the business, for “joint opera-
tions.”
Ready Mixed Concrete has
lately gone into the metal-
quarrying business itself. And
it has so far had a 75 p.c.
acceptance of its offer to take-
over Consolidated Tin, Ltd.,
for its cash-holdings.
Blue Metal Industries a few
days ago announced that it
had acquired Clark Kilns,
Ltd., for 480,000 shares.
Ready-mixed concrete could
become a backyard industry so
far as “batching” goes. But
supplies of blue-metal appear
to be the key to the situation,
especially in the Sydney area,
where deposits of easily

accessible basalt are not fre-
quent. No doubt the springing-
up of new ready-mixed
concrete concerns which are
attached to construction groups
has prompted the sudden
move among the massive con-
crete and blue-metal enterprises
to consolidation—or diversi-
fication, if you insist.
Interstate Credits
Co swift (and comparatively
large) have been the capital
developments and other moves
in Interstate Credit and Devel-
opment, Ltd., Sydney, that the
current year’s accounts (to June
30 next) are likely to exhibit a
much different picture from
that shown in the 1958-59
figures.
To start with, paid capital
was only £30,000 at June 30
last year. Already it has been
increased to £330,000 (in ss.
shares), and a one-for-three
issue is now on the market,
which, when fully-paid, will
take the share-register total up
to £440,000.
In October last the directors
said that the activities of the
co. and its subsidiaries com-
prised (a) general financing,
land-subdivision in N.S.W. and
Queensland, and home-unit
construction through its hold-
ing in the Credit Purchase
Corporation, Ltd., group of
cos.; ( b ) a 50 p.c. interest
in a co. carrying-out land-sub-
division and development in
Victoria; (c) a 50 p.c. interest
in Castle Homes Pty., Ltd.,
which constructs moderately
priced homes in Sydney metro-
politan area and nearby; (d) a
50 p.c. interest in Murrays
Timber Industries, Ltd. —a co.
taking-over the timber-distri-
buting section of Murray Bros.,
Ltd.
The co.’s exact interest in
Credit Purchase Corporation,
Ltd., is not disclosed, but it is
said to be a substantial
majority-interest now.
Interstate Credits was for-
merly Worsted Industries, Ltd.,
which was formed in 1951 at
the height of the textile boom
and which was in trouble right
from its year of birth. In
October, 1958, a majority of its
shares were acquired by A.T.G.
Holdings, Ltd., and Barsel In-
vestments Pty., who were in-
terested in Worsted Industries’
accumulated losses and in its
£25,000 of cash. At the time
of the takeover it was indicated
that Worsted (now Interstate
Credits) would become the
owner of 55 p.c. of the shares
in Credit Purchase Corp., which
at June 30, 1958, had out-
standings of £1,042,557, term
deposits and debentures of
£776,096, and a paid capital of
£184,900. This after four years
in business.
A year later the group had
land for resale and shares in
home-unit cos., £140,075; out-
“Just think—back home they'd be paying five-shillings
each for coconuts !”
standings of £1,256,127; cash,
etc., £9876; and intangibles of
£3127.
Liabilities included deben-
tures of £403,167; and over-
draft, deposits and sundry
creditors of £829,385.
Net assets figured at £191,190,
and at this stage outside in-
terests were far greater than
those of Interstate Credits; out-
siders owned £146,328, Inter-
state Credits £44,862.
The group made a net profit
of £69,218 (after tax of
£38,281), of which I.C. got
£30,937, and outsiders £38,281.
From this cut-up of the profits
(compared with the cut-up of
the assets) it would appear that
I.C. has a comparatively large
holding in the more profitable
members of the group.
As it was, on its midget
capital of £30,000, I.C.’s share
of the profits represented 103
p.c.
No dividend was paid for the
year, and there has as yet been
no interim distribution for the
current term.
But the sharemarket has be-
come intrigued with the possi-
bilities of the group, especially
in view of the present real-
estate and home-unit boom;
also, apparently, with the
capacity of this enterprise to
establish such a high borrowed-
money gearing in relation to
such a small group-capital.
Even though this carries its
dangers as well as its advan-
tages, it is at present fashion-
able and profitable; and the
board is now consolidating the
position by enlarging the capi-
tal-base.
On the market 9s. 3d. is being
paid for the ss. shares, with
4s. being offered for the
rights to the new issue.
The board of Interstate
Credits, Ltd., is composed of
E. E. Fortescue (chairman), E.
H. P. Abies (managing), C. J.
Berg, J. S. Cox, and F. W.
Millar.
A.M.P. Bonuses Best Since
1929
'T'he A.M.P. Society's bonus
rates this year will be the
highest for 30 years, and almost
£30,000,000 will be added to
participating policies.
Sums assured under the
A.M.P. policies now total
£1,872,302,389, including the
1959 bonus, M. C. Buttfield,
general manager of the A.M.P.,
said on March 30.
Ten years ago, under the
Federal monetary policy then
prevailing, one had reason to
doubt whether bonus-rates
would ever get back to those
of 1939, let alone 1929.
Ampol-Goodrich Tyres
A mpol - B. F. Goodrich
opened their joint tyre
venture at Somerton, Mel-
bourne (with some encourag-
ing words from Premier Bolte),
intelligently. The day the fac-
tory was opened, advertise-
ments in the newspapers pro-
claimed the new tyres were on
sale —unlike some merchandis-
ing methods, books, particu-
larly, when rave reviews are
followed by sighs from the
booksellers that supplies won’t
be available for some months.
About 90 per cent, of the
tyre-making machinery for the
new plant was made in Aus-
tralia, and 1100 tyres will be
turned-out daily.
National Consolidated
'T'here was a slight sagging in
the shares of National
Consolidated, Ltd., a few days
ago. The ss. scrip dropped
below 295., but, after a string

Bass Strait Oil-prospecting
TAr. D. E. Thomas, Victorian
Chief State Geologist, sees
B.H.P. carrying out oil-drilling
in Bass Strait and the nearby
Southern Ocean from plat-
forms similar to those in the
Gulf of Mexico.
B.H.P. has applied to the
Tasmanian Government for
permission to search for oil
over 33,000 square-miles of
Bass Strait, including King and
Flinders islands, and to the Vic-
torian Government for per-
mission to search in Bass Strait
off the Ninety Mile Beach,
Gippsland, and off the Western
District, in the Southern
Ocean.
If drilling appeared justified
by geophysical surveys of the
offshore seabed, Dr. Thomas
estimates the drilling-platform
would need legs sinking 300 ft.
into the seabed and would cost
£1 million.
Sargood Gardiner, Ltd.
"POLLOWING the virtual lifting
-*• of import-restrictions, the
shares of wholesale softgoods’
merchant Sargood Gardiner,
Ltd., one of the lame ducks of
the post-war share-boom, have
shown lively appreciation over
the past week. The £1 ords.
were at 21s. a few weeks ago.
They have lately sold at 355.
There has been takeover talk.
Under import-restriction the
co. suffered with other old-
established concerns as new-
comer enterprises cut into total
quotas, and Sargood’s ven-
tures into local production
struck some snags.
Trading in 1958-59 was par-
ticularly difficult, net profit
falling from £86,561 to £48,134.
After payment of pref. divs.,
the profit represented only
3.5 p.c. on ord. capital, com-
pared with 12.2 p.c. in the
previous year. But because
trade had brightened consider-
ably early in the present term,
the usual 6 p.c. ord. div. was
repeated.
During 1958-59, in order to
meet in advance the possibility
of takeover offers, freeholds
were lifted from their previous
1933 appraisements to current
valuations. As a result,
£589,500 was added to reserves,
which, including general re-
serves, totalled £1,102,979 at
June 30, and were equal to 68s
for each of the 462,294 £1 ord.
shares. (There is also £550,816
of cheap money in the form of
5 p.c. participating prefs. as
well).
The board has been remodel-
ling the co.’s trading policy,
and it hopes to report favor-
able progress about October
this year. In the meantime, an
interim distribution is just
about due, and it will also be
awaited with interest.
Bali Plantations Extendi
T>ali Plantations, Ltd.,
which made an issue of
400,000 10s. shares in July,
last year, took-over Bali plan-
tation (of 1175 acres freehold),
on Unea Island, north of New
Britain. It produces copra
(there are 54,000 coconut-
palms) and cocoa (84,000 inter-
planted cocoa-trees). No fur-
ther planting of coconut-palms
is considered practicable on
Bali, but an additional 60,000
cocoa-trees, it was estimated,
could be put in.
Bali plantation is considered
to be the best of its type in New
Guinea.
Soon after Bali was floated,
Londolovit plantation was
acquired. The takeover of
Bali plantation was not effected
until September 1, 1959, and
acquisition of Londolovit plan-
tation became effective on the
same date.
To enable the co.’s first
balance-sheet and accounts to
cover a full year’s trading per-
mission was obtained from the
taxation authorities to balance
on August 31 in each year
instead of June 30.
An interim div. of 5 p.c. has
now been declared.
On Bali, 50,000 new cocoa-
trees have been planted, and on
Londolovit an experimental
planting of 25,000 cocoa-trees
has been completed.
Copra production on Bali
has been slightly below esti-
mates, but Londolovit produc-
tion exceeds anticipations, and
the overall result is considered
to be quite satisfactory.
Marau and Kolai plantations
have recently been bought for
£36,000, and are regarded as
“a very satisfactory purchase.”
In 1956 the two properties were
valued by a leading valuer in
the Territory at £40,625.
These adjoining plantations,
situated on the south coast of
New Britain, are together pro-
ducing 300 tons of copra a
year. There is no cocoa, but
there is scope for some plant-
ing. An interim arrangement
has been made with the bank
to finance the purchase.
The company’s first accounts
wilt cover the 12 months from
the commencement of business
to August 31, 1960.

The Dobell
Nobody should ever attempt
to judge a painting from a
reproduction. Reproductions
nearly always make bad paint-
ings look good and good
paintings look bad. Still less
can you judge from a news-
paper reproduction of a repro-
duction —witness the photo-
graph of Dobell’s portrait of
Mr. Menzies in the “S.M.
Herald,” which made the
P.M.’s cheeks Seem drawn with
dark furrows, whereas nothing
of the kind shows in the color-
reproduction in “Time.”
People who have seen the
original portrait tell me it is
a good Dobell (quite a small
one), with no distortion about
it ; and as to its artistic quality
I’d sooner take their opinion
than try to judge from the
“Time” cover —except that the
pose is good and the coloring
in the background is obviously
attractive and pleasantly free
from formality.
I’m not even sure if you can
fairly assess even the simple
question of likeness from a
reproduction ; I’d need a look
at the original portrait and
another look at the P.M. to be
sure. Generally you find that
the artist is right. But, as one
who has seen the magnifico
shedding his lustre around Can-
berra a few times, I’m inclined
to think that Dobell hasn’t
quite got him: one 90-minute
sitting, to make sketches to
work-on afterwards, isn’t really
enough for a sound portrait.
The forehead, the famous
eyebrows, the eyes, yes. The
rest of the face, and the hands
which always look more like
instruments of oratory than
ordinary fists—l doubt it. What
I chiefly miss is a sort of
extremely clean-shaven alert-
ness which always seems to me
characteristic of the P.M.’s
appearance. Dobell’s paint, be-
sides missing or muffling some-
thing in the features, looks a
bit scruffy.
In one respect, though, it
does Menzies more justice than
most of the ordinary news-
paper photographs, which for
some mysterious reason always
emphasise his rotundity.
Menzies does carry a lot of
weight, but has the stature to
make it, as in Dobell’s portrait,
unnoticeable.

Two Painters
On the evidence of her ex-
hibition at the Australian Gal-
leries (Melbourne) Mary Cecil
Allen finds a great deal of
fascination in her environment,
whether it be Australia—where
she was born—or America,
where she has been living since
1930.
Her watercolors everywhere
reflect a simple and joyous
response to the life around
her. Though perhaps at the
expense of any real depth, the
almost epigrammatical brevity
of her approach has the twin-
virtues of never boring and of
being responsible for such
pleasant examples of artistic
shorthand as “Eildon Weir,”
“Cutting Ice” and “Bringing
the Nets to the Dunes.”
By comparison the work of
Leslie Sands (Tasrqanian Tour-
ist Bureau Gallery), often seems
muddled and tired. Sands
gives the impression of being
in some confusion as to the
proper use of his chosen media.
In his oils he seems to be
striving for a simplicity which
in most cases only watercolors
could yield,, while in his water-
colors he fusses over detail in
a manner which the limitations
of the medium simply won’t
permit.
His most effective work is to
be found in such graceful little
seascapes as “Inlet, Queens-
land,” “Low Tide” and “Still
Water.”
Stage and Music
“Two for the Seesaw”
By turns funny and deeply
moving, this (at Melbourne
Comedy) is an extremely well-
written. though not a particu-
larly well-thought-out, study
of the age-old conflict between
peoples' wants and needs, and
of the frustrations that can
arise therefrom.
Jerry, an Omaha attorney
adrift in New York while
waiting for his divorce to be
settled, meets Gittel, a warm-
hearted, extroverted Jewish
dancer from the Bronx. Gittel
has all her life given emo-
tional support to others as
freely as Jerry has taken it
from others ; and he senses in
her an opportunity to indulge
at last in some giving of his
unconditional affection and
support.
But Gittel finds these impos-
sible to accept. Vainly he tries
to make her feel and believe
that she deserves such gifts,
that he wants nothing in
return, that they are what she
needs in order to overcome,
among other things, a chronic
inferiority-complex. (A job
for a psychoanalyst?
Probably.)
Jerry does make some head-
way, but there are altogether
too many complications—
Gittel has an ulcer (no doubt
neurotic in origin) ; she aspires
to be a successful dancer, but
is too easily led astray and
lacks focus ; Jerry has his Bar
exams and, of course, his wife,
with whom he is still some-
how in love ; and the play ends
rather confusingly on the sug-
gestion that he will return to
her.
All this is spun-out neatly
enough, but it would have been
more satisfying if the author
had been able to resist the
temptation to fit-in oversmart
lines whenever a chance
offered. (He might do worse
than heed William Faulkner’s
advice on this question: “Kill
all your darlings! ”)
William Rees’s hitchless pro-
duction copes very effectively
with the problems of nine
scene-changes (simplified by
the use of a revolve) and of
sustaining interest with only
two characters at his disposal.
Diana Perryman creates a
magnificent Gittel, convincing
throughout the fast fluctuations
of mood. Grant Taylor’s Jerry
has too much theatrical sheen
and too little depth, but overall
he succeeds in developing an
illusion of real tension between
himself and his exuberant co-
star.

Mackerras in Brisbane
Charles Mackerras got Bris-
bane’s new concert-season off
to a fine start with a pro-
gramme that began in % a spirit
of gravity and ended in a
blaze of glory.
Brahms’s “Tragic” Overture
seems to have been written in

rather than as a pointer to any

ductor may achieve. It found
a Queensland orchestra well
recovered from the summer
doldrums and clearly re-
hearsed with the utmost care.
This, and Delius’s “Walk to
the Paradise Garden,” created
an atmosphere soon to be
ruffled by the appearance of
French pianist Philippe Entre-
mont. Nothing in his pub-
licity quite suggested that this
frail-looking young man was
such a fountain of energy, as
he proceeded to demonstrate
in Prokofieff’s Third Piano
Concerto.
This is one of the most
brilliant combinations of piano
and orchestra in existence, de-
manding a soloist with a flood
of high spirits and the ability
to switch his mood and restrain
his physical powers for a
gentle stroking of the ' key-
board in the lyrical sections.
Entremont must be the only
pianist to get such an ovation
for a modern piece in this hall.
It was a fine example of the
convergence of jazz and con-
temporary orchestral music,
and the rafters of the Town
Hall have not shaken so joy-
fully for a long time. With
Mackerras obviously enjoying
his command of the orchestra,
the result was sheer exhilara-
tion.
The whole concert was
musical gluttony indeed. On
top of a first half satisfying in
itself, Mackerras played the
Schubert “Great” Symphony,
10 minutes short of an hour
in running-time, and a cruel
test of an orchestra’s physical
stamina. Yet the orchestra
sailed through it as though no
one had heard that the Royal
Philharmonic had jibbed at the
music during the first London
rehearsal. There was rough-
ness in places, but the total
effect was impressive. A lot
can be said for putting such
orchestral monsters in the first
half of the concert when the
players are fresh, but this
would make the rest of the pro-
gramme sound like an anti-
climax.
Mackerras gave no fake
“Viennese” inter pretation.
Rather he played the symphony
with much emphasis on the
passion that hangs over every
bar. This was not the sad
little Schubert some legends
would have us believe, but the
great musician modern studies
are beginning to reveal —a con-
temporary of Beethoven and,
in this symphony at least, a
fellow-spirit.

“The Long and the Short
and the Tall”
What makes this latest offer-
ing of M e 1 b o u r n e’s Little
Theatre a harrowing and dis-
turbing experience is English
playwright Willis Hall’s ability
to demonstrate in a clear
dramatic language that beneath
the flags and the uniforms,
beneath the apparent mateship
and conscious intentions of
men at war, there often lie
impulses which are actually far
from honorable, and which in
effect make true victory an
impossibility.
This is passionately an anti-
war play, its message unmistak-
ably pacifist. It opens and
tragically ends in and close by
a deserted tin-miner’s hut in
the Malayan jungle. It is early
in 1942, and the Japanese are
advancing on Singapore. A
patrol of British soldiers lose
radio contact with their base
and take refuge in the hut.
They capture a scouting
Japanese, and this is the event
which the playwright exploits
as a metaphor of the larger
issues of war.
As produced by George Fair-
fax, the result stands out as a
fine example of how a play of
some depth can at the same
time come across as a work of
almost unbearable suspense.
Admittedly the opening night
found most of the all-male
cast a little hesitant over certain
scenes (a fault which no doubt
will be ironed-out in later per-
formances), but, overall, their
work was full of merit. None
did better than Bryan Edward
in the savagely contradictory
role of Private Bamforth; and
Brian Moll must be noted for
his skill in turning the Japanese
soldier into an unforgettable
character —despite having not
one line or word of dialogue
to assist him.
John Truscott’s startlingly
realistic set was well up to the
standard one has come to ex-
pect from this most competent
of Melbourne’s stage-designers.
❖ ❖ ❖
Brahms’s “Requiem”
In the performance of this
extensively searching work
given at the Cathedral by Syd-
ney’s St. Andrew's Cathedral
Choral Society the conductor,
Mervyn Byers, was served fairly
well by a choir which only on
a couple of occasions failed to
answer his exhortations in full.
In the finest piece of choral
writing Brahms ever fashioned,
“Behold, All Flesh is as Grass,”
there was a deficiency of light
and shade which robbed this
funeral-march of some of its
splendors; and in “How Lovely
Are Thy Dwellings” the shad-
ing-away in the diminishing
passages lacked polish. These
defects, however, were more
than counterweighted by sus-
tained serenity in the legato
phases, good balance between
the choir’s sections, and ex-
pressiveness underlining the
tenderness and pathos which
form the core of the massed
voices’ assignment.
Robin Gurr, who sang
throughout with relaxed faci-
lity, achieved lyrical loveliness
in “Ye Now Have Sorrow,”
and her transition from the
expression of sorrow to the
utterance of final tranquillity
was satisfying.
Barry Strong kept a tight
rein on his natural resonance
in the early phases of his open-
ing song, “Lord, Let Me Know
Mine End,” but in the passages
where soloist and chorus are
used antiphonically his decla-
matory style was impressive.
In his final song, “Here On
Earth Have We No Continu-
ing Place,” compassing some of
Brahms’s most opulently
dramatic pages, Mr. Strong
succeeded in creating an atmo-
sphere of tension which was to
break in the shouted exultation
of the final chorus. In this
section, as elsewhere, David
Barkla’s work at the organ was
of high quality.
The evening began with
Byrd’s “Mass for Four Voices,”
a piece of liturgical classicism
in direct contrast to the
“Requiem.” It was marked by
singing of subdued strength
and fervor and strict discipline.

“Orpheus Descending”
Sydney’s Ensemble Theatre
is now restaging this Tennessee
Williams play about a foot-
loose guitarist who gets caught-
up in, and corrupted by, the
decadent society of a small
town in the Deep South, mis-
understood and finally des-
troyed by an irate mob.
In spite of its uneven cast,
Hayes Gordon's production is
vivid and well informed
throughout, making much of
every shock and sensation the
play has to offer; and admir-
able performances are pro-
vided by Kevin Dalton, as the
guitarist, and Clarissa Kaye, as
the love-hungry storekeeper
whose demands undermine
him.
The play itself, however, will
satisfy only those who, in
return for a set of striking
theatrical effects, are prepared
to take. any amount of con-
trived poetry (sometimes mixed
to the point of bathos with the
familiar solemn lewdness); pre-
tentious symbolism (the guitar-
ist is not only likened to
Orpheus and a beautiful legless
bird; he is murdered on “the
Saturday before Easter”); and
yet another course of the stale
half-truths (“Everyone is con-
demned to solitary confinement
in the cell of his own skin,”
human relationships inevitably
corrupt the innocent, etc.)
which for long have served this
playwright as ideas.

be so well played should surely
some day mean something to
the patient ear. So also should
the Schoenberg and Webern
songs sung by Marilyn Richard-
son.
In Richard Meale’s flute-and-
piano sonata Peter Richard-
son’s flute stayed up at the top
of the scale, and every time the
piano growled a bass chord it
would jump a few notes higher,
but towards the end of the piece
the piano stopped this tedious
game and danced about the
centre of the keyboard. It
seemed much happier.
New Australian Musical
Despite the lapses in the
book —the “mine tinkits,” the
use of a Dave with an embar-
rassing similarity to the folk-
character of bar-room stories,
and values redolent of “The
Desert Song” and “Rio Rita”
—the Australian premiere of
Albert Arlen’s musical, “The
Girl from the Snowy,” was
launched with extaordinary
gusto and success by Canberra
Repertory.
Much of this success was due
to the labor and talents of
Albert Arlen and Nancy
Brown. Arlen wrote the music,
which is not only full of memor-
able and pleasing numbers but
at times tugs at the heart in a
shamelessly sentimental but
nonetheless pleasing way.
Arlen also produced the
show, having drilled his cast
and trained his singers so well
that it moved smoothly—in-
deed, with an occasional air of
professional competence.
Nancy Brown had the
warmth of personality, the
reserves of passion, the innate
dignity as well as the histrionic
talents to smooth-over the
bumpy passages in the book.
She also has the power to
evoke magic on the stage —to
make an audience feel that life
should be like the aspirations
of a musical-comedy heroine.
Of the others, it may be in-
vidious to single out any from
what was so obviously a team
working together, and enjoying
themselves. Jim Hutchins
clowned effectively with Wendy
Longmore, who turned-on the
beer for the boys with the
verve of an old trooper. Peer
"Now, don't start looking at things, Mother, or We'll
never get around."
Larsen sang pleasingly about
his Norway; Ann Briant caught
the eye twice with her dancing.
But it was essentially an even-
ing for a team —or, rather, it
was Albert Arlen’s evening, for
as he sat at the piano one could
see just how much he had en-
joyed creating the whole thing,
as well as his pleasure that
other people were now sharing
the fun with him.
Perhaps next time he will
give us the fun without those
embarrassing self - conscious
Australianisms.

won the special radio-
documentary section of the
Italia Prize with Ivan Smith’s
“Death of a Wombat.”
The Italia Prize has two
sections in both radio and tele-

The A.B.C. will closely
examine all relevant works
drawn from its normal pro-
gramme output during the past
two years, with a view to
selecting entries. In addition,
the A.B.C. invites authors,
composers and film-producers
to submit works.
Entries should be in the

son goes out of his way, in
fact, to stress that only after
long and profound considera-
tion did she come to realise
that, as Dr. Fortunati, the
man with whom she had
worked devotedly in a Congo
hospital, had said, Nature
hadn’t fitted her for unques-
tioning obedience.
The film falls naturally into
two parts. The first half is
devoted to convent life—the
strict discipline imposed and
the self - discipline cultivated,
and the dedication needed to
pursue a life of sacrifice.
Fascinating in its detail, this
section is treated with great
reverence and has the ring of
complete authenticity.
The second half mainly
concerns events in the Belgian
Congo, where Sister Luke’s
natural gifts for nursing in-
evitably led her. Here director
Fred Zinnemann uses vivid
colors as tellingly as he did
the greys, blacks and whites
in the convent-scenes. It is
when Sister Luke is recalled to
the “mother house” in Bel-
gium that events lead swiftly
to her momentous decision,
and these scenes, again, are
conducted with a gentle
sadness.
As Sister Luke, Audrey
Hepburn gives a sensitive per-
formance. She is neither a
starry-eyed visionary nor a
rebel against an authority she
clearly recognises and respects.
Peter Finch is a Fortunati
whose quietly cynical manner
and bantering tone conceal a
deep respect for a highly
skilled nurse —and apparently
nothing more.
Outstanding portraits are
given by Dame Edith Evans
and Dame Peggy Ashcroft
as affectionately watchful
Mothers-superior.

A lthough the h.-p. honeymoon is
over, and the great TV-buying spree
has slackened-down, the leading finance
cos. are in no danger. Credit-buying is
with us to stay, even if certain costly
adjustments to periodic swings in the
direction of consumer-spending are be-
coming part of the business routine.
Large profits attracted a good deal of
capital into the h.-p. game, competition
intensified, operating-expenses increased
and earnings slimmed-down. And it has
been deemed prudent to edge-down the
interest-rates a bit.
However, the basic demand for con-
sumer-finance is stronger than ever. Cars
are selling well, h.-p. outstandings are
rising and the future looks quite happy.
Increasing competition dampens the in-
flationary effect of h.-p. sales.
A.G.C.’s h.-p. debtors leaped by £8.9
million to £56.7 million during last term,
amounting to £57.604,713 if other loans,
etc., are included. Insurance business
improved, but consolidated net profit
was lower because of reduced hiring-
charges, increased operating-costs, rising
losses on repossessions and higher stamp-
duties in three States.
The bulk of the business comes from
financing sales of motor-vehicles. The
Bank of N.S.W. (which holds a 40 p.c.
share-interest in A.G.C.) provides a
massive prop for the group to lean on
in time of need.
The A.G.C. family includes the parent
and eight subsidiaries —Traders Finance
Corporation, Ltd., Alliance Finance
Corpn. (N.Z.), Ltd., Transport and
General Insurance Co., Ltd. (the larger
of two insurance offshoots), Empire In-
surances. Ltd., A.G.C. . (Pacific), Ltd.,
T.F.C. (Wholesale) Pty., A.G.C. (Whole-
sale) Pty. and Transport and General
Life Assurance Co., Ltd.
The group’s hire-purchase turnover
increased by a further £l2 million to
£97 million in the year ended lune 30,
1959. Aggregate pre-tax net profit was
£254,129 lower at £2,264,320, after pay-
ing all expenses, providing £36,413 for
depreciation on fixed assets (up £11,027)
and writing £62,501 off motor-cars and
furniture. Another £35,000 was trans-
ferred to. the staff fund.
Tax - provision absorbed £941,158
(down £133,294). Consolidated net
profit was £106,525 lower at

After satisfying the unchanged pref.-
div. (£34.000), the earning-rate was
19.1 p.c. on the unchanged average ord.
capital, compared with 20.8 p.c. in the
previous term, and 30.1 p.c., 30.5 p.c.,
46.2 p.c. and 45 p.c. back to 1954.
The steady 15 p.c. ord. dividend was
covered without difficulty. Reserves
benefited by £257,911, and also by
£llO6 capital-profits and £11,234 tax
overprovided, but were reduced by a
£lOO,OOO transfer to contingencies pro-
vision.
Total reserves and undistributed
profits were disclosed at £6,655,790,

in 150,000 6 p.c. cum. 20s. first prefs.,

Last term was marked by the elimina-
tion of bank accommodation (£6,347,732
in 1957-58) from the consolidated
balance-sheet and a big increase in
capital borrowings (debentures and term-
deposits) :

Debenture capital rose by £12,132,591
to £27,522,541 (including £17,510,245
over one-year) and deposits by £2,694,707
to £6,243,115. Creditors and dealers’
reserves and deposits, etc., increased by
£432,075 to £2,064,027, making total
short- and long-term borrowings
£8,911,641 higher at £35,829,683.
Ihe ratio of unearned h.-p. income to
h.-p. debtors was 10.22 p.c.—a satisfac-
tory proportion, taking 10 p.c. to be a
safe margin as the by-and-large general
rule.
The ratio of total loan-capital to
shareholders' equity worked-out at 5.21
to 1. A favorable aspect of the business
is the group’s concentration on motor-
vehicles.
Total registrations of all motor-
vehicles (except motor-cycles) increased
by 12.7 p.c. in 1959, as compared with the
preceding year. By comparison, in 1958
the increase was 11.2 p.c. and in 1957
only 2.6 p.c. In February, 1960, 23,228
new motor-vehicles were registered in
Australia, compared with 18,621 in
February, 1959.
During 1958-59 1,261,500 new h.-p.
agreements were signed in Australia (up
65,500). The value of motor-vehicles,
tractors, etc., accounted for £285.1 million
(up £27.3 million) out of a total £390.4
million-worth of sales financed by h.-p.
cos. By contrast, the value of household
and personal goods (including TV, re-
frigerators, electrical goods, furniture)
financed by h.-p. fell from £83.7 million
to £83.4 million.
H.-p. outstandings steadily rose during
1959, from £344.2 million at the end of
March to £396.5 million at the end of
December. By the end of January, 1960,
the figure increased to £403 million.
These trends indicate that there still
remains a good future in the h.-p. finance
industry, even if brisk competition spells
the end of the earlier very high profits.
Some of the thicker cream may have
been skimmed-off, but the rest of the
milk is all there.
Hire-purchase cos. have their ardent
supporters and virulent critics. But the
simple fact ensuring their continuous
comfortable existence remains. They suit
the lender, the borrowing customer and
the investor.
The sharemarket’s rating of A.G.C.
stock is high. The 20s. ords. last fetched
61s. in Sydney. The immediate re-
turn is 4.9 p.c. on the basis of the steady
15 p.c. div.-rate.

wine, spirit and general merchant. In
addition, Samuel Allen is an agent for
a wide range of manufactured lines, in-
cluding engineering-supplies, farm-equip-
ment, rubber-products, air-conditioning
units, etc. The group also holds the
Ford franchise in Townsville and Mount
Isa through one of the subsidiaries, Mag-
netic Motors Pty.
The other subsidiaries are Hollimans
Pty. (hardware, electrical and sporting-
goods retailer, Townsville), Wypers
(Cairns) Pty. (farm-machinery and hard-
ware retailer, Cairns), A. E. Clayton and
Son Pty. (farm-machinery, irrigation and
hardware retailer, Ayr), Allens Invest-
ments Pty. (the group’s h.-p. and finance
co. for N. Queensland), Tropix Cordials
Pty. and Allens Bottling Co. Pty. (both
asset-holding and trading cos.), Imperial
Hotel (Cairns) Pty. (hotel-trading) and
Queens Park Hotel Pty. (asset-holding
co.).
The prosperity of the group is linked
with the fortunes of North Queensland’s
sugar- and mining-industries, and its
earnings are correspondingly subject to
fluctuations in sugar and metal prices
and quotas. However, diversification of
interests helps to dampen and spread-
out the effect of slumps and booms, as
the group is able to rely for its trading
on a wider section of the State’s
economy.
Last term trading-conditions seemed
to have improved slightly. All sub-
sidiaries, except one, traded profitably
and contributed to group-earnings.
Consolidated profit from trading and
investments for the year ended June 30,

Salaries, wages, operating-expenses, pro-

After paying the unchanged pref.-divs.
(£11,428), the consolidated net profit was
equivalent to an earning-rate of 10.6 p.c.
on the average ordinary capital (9.9 p.c.
in 1957-58) or 9.9 p.c. on the total
paid-up capital.
The steady 8 p.c. ord. dividend
absorbed £64,847, leaving £18,501 for
reserves which also benefited by £4420
capital-profit on sale of fixed assets.

More funds were at- work than in the
previous term. Borrowings on mortgage
were £77,601 higher at £335,070. Over-
draft decreased by £125,143. Short-term
creditors’ deposits jumped by £438,772
to £677,094.
The large increase in the book-value
of land and buildings (by £360,911 to
£1,485,278) and plant (by £52,204 to
£228 ? 803) indicated the group’s expan-
sionary tendencies. Less stock was
carried (down £75,221), and sundry
debtors rose by £73,857 to £802,234.
Working-capital amounted to £223,775
and current ratio was just a shade under
1.2 to 1.
The recent trend to hardening of some
international metal prices may improve
Samuel Allen’s business opportunities in
the current term. In any case the 8 p.c.
div.-rate does not seem to be in danger.
At the last sale in Sydney the 20s
ords. fetched 275. 3d. a unit (contribs.
145.). The yield is 5.9 p.c. on the basis
of the steady 8 p.c. div.-rate.
Monbulk Preserves, Ltd.
PJrom its two factories, one at Mon-
bulk (about 30 miles out of
Melbourne), the other at Hobart, Mon-
bulk Preserves, Ltd., turns-out a variety
of jams, canned-fruit and preserves.
Operating cos. are:
D. Camm and Sons Pty.; D. Camm and
Sons (Tas.) Pty.; Model Preserving Co.
Pty.; Jinks and Morgan Pty.
In 1895 the late D. T. Camm began
berry-fruitgrowing in Victoria. In 1912
he established a small jam-making plant
at Monbulk. In 1930 D. Camm and
Sons Pty. was formed to take-over the
business, and products were marketed
for the first time under the now well-
known Monbulk label. Steady expan-
sion followed, the second World War
providing considerable impetus to activity.
In 1946 the organisation crossed Bass
Strait, setting-up in Hobart. In 1957,
after graduating to public status, the
group acquired Model Preserving Co.
Pty., adding the Home Maid brands to
its lines.
Four months ago, Monbulk’s ss. ords.
traded on ’Change at around 10s., but
recent quotations have slipped, the shares
selling at Bs. 3d. last week. Publication
of accounts in January showed that
1958-59 profits had taken quite a tumble,
slipping to £44,726 (down £26,500).
Referring to the diminished profit, the
chairman says “it is considered satis-
factory, having regard to the intense
competition in both the home and export
markets.”
Ever since 1952, when the U.K. market
suddenly receded—in that year sugar and
various sweet foods were taken off the
ration in the U.K., and English jam-
manufacturers resumed normal produc-
tion —Monbulk has had to rely more
and more on local demand for disposal
of its jams. Today only 10 p.c. of Aus-
tralian jam-production finds its way
overseas. Monbulk countered dimin-
ished export income from jam by
stepping-up overseas sales of canned
fruits, by product-diversification, and by
intensive exploration of the local market.
Earnings responded, so much so that
during 1953-57 total turnover of the
group increased upwards of 95 p.c. But
in 1958-59 canned-fruit exports dropped,
and indications at present point to a
further decline in the current term.
Fortunately sales on the Australian mar-
ket were maintained, though at a less-
profitable margin.
The Australian canned-fruit industry,
very largely dependent on exports for
its income, is extremely sensitive to
competition, particularly from low-cost
producers such as South Africa, Malaya
and California. Over 50 p.c. of Aus-
tralia’s output is shipped abroad, and
of this over 90 p.c. to the U.K. The
whole situation is aggravated by condi-
tions of world surplus. Possibly the
best outlet for local production lies in

jncreased home consumption
(as was the case with jam),
but this, of course, is a long-
term rather than a short-term
solution.
Monbulk’s profit last term
was ascertained after setting
aside £25,150 for tax (down
£21,305) and £15,407 for depre-
ciation (down £901). Equal to
only 16.2 p.c. (by itself a
reasonable figure) on average
capital, it fails to measure-up
to previous earning-rates:
31 p.c. in 1952-58, 27.1 p.c. in
1956-57. Little solace attaches
to the co.’s one-for-five par
issue early in the term, wh ch
lifted paid capital by £46,000 to
£276,000:

Competition continues keen.
Nevertheless sales on export
and local markets are ahead of
last year. It seems certain,
however, that pressure will
become still more intense in
the near future, especially on
the U.K. market. Australian
canners, including Monbulk,
are obliged to pay higher prices
for fresh fruit than, for
instance, rival producers in
South Africa. With an eye to
the cost problem the co.
retained the services of a firm
of specialist consultants last
term, and some of their
recommendations are to be
incorporated in the merchandis-
ing and distribution functions.

Brisbane's George Street. Once
essentially a draper, McDon-

The co. was very much on
the alert to get its share of

improving its results last term.
Despite strong competition,
the year ended January 31,
1960, was satisfactory. Gross
profit from trading increased
by £21,411 to £434,771.
Marketing and administrative

were just a trifle lower at
£314,631, but the depreciation
provision was £3774 higher at
£16,698.

for tax (up £7200), net profit

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
Wellington, March 28, 1960.
New Zealand will spend
£1 million over the next
five years in investigating
geothermal-steam potential for
the production of electricity.
Most of the work will be
at Wairakei, where significant
data is already being obtained.
The Government is con-
vinced that the expenditure
entailed in expanding its pro-
gramme of investigation of
areas showing a high power-
potential will return good
results.
The Ministry of Works
estimates that the cost per
unit of net output from the
Wairakei power-station, when
it is operating at its proposed
maximum capacity of about
250,000 kilowatts, will be
below that of many of the
hydro - power stations at
present building or under
consideration.
The estimated cost per unit
Wairakei is .34d. This
compares with ,439 d. for the
Matamahina project and ,446 d.
for the Cook Strait cable
proposal.
Sufficient steam is already
being produced from the pro-
duction area at Wairakei to
meet the net requirements of
the power-station when its full
capacity is installed. This area
is nearly threequarters of a
square-mile in extent.
Adjacent there are about
four square-rniles of country
with the potential for
producing geothermal steam.
Promising results have been
obtained from several widely
spaced bores, and the Govern-
ment now wishes to define the
most favorable localities by
more drilling.
This programme is in addi-
tion to the £3-million hydro-
electric power - investigation
plan authorised by the Govern-
ment last August.
Aluminium
Export products from the
aluminium industry soon to be
established in the South
Island would earn almost as
much as New Zealand’s export
of dairy produce, the Minister
of Electricity, Mr. Watt, told
the annual conference of the
North . Island Electrical
Workers' Union.
Mr. Watt said the country’s
ability to produce cheap power
was a factor underlying the
Government's confidence in
inviting big overseas manufac-
turers to invest money in the
promotion of industries in New
Zealand.
This applied not only to the
aluminium industry but also
to the proposed oil-refinery,
the Nelson cotton-mill and the
installation of a second paper-
machine at Kawerau.
It was impossible to plan
the development of New
Zealand industries while walk-
ing a tight-rope wondering if
there was to be a shortage or
surplus of power. The coun-
try had to be assured of an
adequate supply of cheap
power.
The power-shortage had
been overcome. For the first
time in 17 years both the
North and South Islands of
the country were completely
free of restrictions on the con-
sumption of electricity.
Rosy Picture
A rosy picture of N.Z.’s
economic future was painted
by the Prime Minister, Mr.
Nash, when he addressed the
N.Z. Society of Accountants.
During the past 20 years,
he said, gross national product
had increased by 122 per cent.
In 1939—in terms of 1959
purchasing-power and adjusted
by the Consumers’ Price Index
—the gross national product
was £514 million. In 1959 it
was £ll4O million.
The Dominion had a popu-
lation of 1,600,000 in 1939 and
2,300,000 in 1959 —an increase
of 41 per cent. The real
national product per capita was
£316 in 1939 and £495 in 1959
—a 57 per cent, increase.
By 1979 N.Z.’s population
was expected to increase—on
the basis of 5000 migrants
annually—to 3,400,000, and
national expenditure would
have increased by £2620
million.
During the next 20 years
the demand for goods and ser-
vices would grow by about
130 per cent.
The labor force, increasing
by 44 per cent., would total
1,238,000 by 1979. Most of
the extra workers would be
absorbed in the manufactur-
ing, distribution and services
industries. The primary indus-
tries were not likely to have a
big demand for labor.
N.Z. was on the verge of a
new manufacturing era and
heavy industry would be
established during the next 20
years. National income would
increase as industry developed
and more industries would
become economic as markets
expanded.
Political Promises
With the general elections
to be held late this year, things
are warming-up in the political
sphere.
The Minister of Finance,
Mr. Nordmeyer, said at a
public meeting that as circum-
stances permitted the rates of
“certain taxes” would be
reduced.
He followed that up a few
days later by saying: “Income-
tax has now reached a level
which cannot be substantially
reduced, and we have now
reached a taxation level that
is reasonably fair. As soon as
I can see my way clear to
make any reduction in taxes
other than income-tax, I will
do so.”
The Leader of the Opposi-
tion, Mr. Holyoake, replied
promptly with a pledge that
the National party will defi-
nitely reduce the rate of taxa-
tion immediately it becomes!
the Government
“Our first objective will be
to get the rate of taxation
down to the level it was at
when we left office in 1957,”
he said. “We will then pro-
gressively 'reduce taxes as we
did before.”
Attractive though it is, the
second part, at least, of this
promise may cause even
National - party supporters
to wonder.

TO THE EX-SERVICEMAN
The day is sad, the clouds are grey,
I hear the Serviceman’s away.
His threats to shoot I deprecate—
His ginger-beer was far from great.
For many years (he must be old)
I came accustomed to be told
My scripts are bad,
My coins aren’t old,
And yet he sounded so informed
My heart invariably warmed
At his authoritative tone.
At once an artist, engineer,
A miner, lawyer, vintner, seer,
Was he a man to know so much
That with his very human touch
He got me beer, the baby-bonus?
On his broad shoulders lay the onus
Of getting bursaries and pensions;
And now he’s gone I face the task
Of breaking-in his bold successor
Who now becomes my sole confessor.
No ingrate I —my thanks I give,
To Servicemen. How do they live?
Information Sought
What causes twilight, and why
does it increase in duration away
from the Equator ?
It is caused by the intervention
of the atmosphere between the sun
and the earth’s surface. When the
sun is some distance below the
horizon the upper layers of air
remain illuminated and reflect the
light to us. Twilight lasts until
the sun is 18 deg. below the
horizon; its duration depends on
season and latitude, being governed
by the sun’s altitude and declina-
tion. Near the Equator, where the
sun is more directly overhead,
twilight must be shorter than near
the Poles, where the motion towards
the horizon is oblique.

In a press-photograph of the
swearing-in ceremony of the new
Governor-General at Canberra the
guard-of-honor from Duntroon was
shown parading with rifles “at the
slope’’ on the right shoulder. Does
this mean that the ceremonial-drill
of the Australian Army has been
changed to American style ?
No. The Americans use the
right shoulder for slope-arms. In
the Canberra guard-of-honor the
cadets, armed with the new F.N.
rifle, were at “the shoulder,” not
at “the slope.” At “the shoulder”
(used by British light-infantry
regiments on certain occasions as
alternative to “the trail”) rifles are
always carried parallel to the right
side of the body, with the right
arm at its full extent, supporting
the weight of the rifle with the
thumb and first two fingers
through the trigger-guard.

(1) No; he never contested one.
(2) His only win beyond two miles
was the A.J.C. Plate of 18 fur-
longs, in which as a three-year-old
he carried 7.13. He clocked
in that race, establishing a record
for the distance. It was, inciden-

Brief Answers
B.I.: Suggest you write to the
manager, Talkeries Musical Store,
161 Castlereagh Street, Sydney....
D.V.W.: This is rather a serious
problem, and it might be best to
consult a builder and have the
floor topped with a waterproof-
cement mixture. Otherwise, buy a
waterproofing compound and
make-up a small quantity at a
time —it may dry quickly. There
are many cement-sealers on the
market, and these should be
investigated; also some of the wall-
board types of sheetings, for which
damp-proofing is claimed. The
lino-tiles have their own kind of
underfelt, and are laid with a dark
tarry mixture which acts to a small
degree to protect the tiles from
damp. You may be able to get
advice from the Master Builders'
Association, 1 King Street, New-
town, Sydney, if the job seems
formidable. Be sure to give full
details of situation and size of
r00m... .Mrs. E.W.: Submit to
Jacaranda Press Ply., Ltd., 73
Elizabeth Street, Brisbane....
N.D.: After “panning,” cigarette-
tobacco doesn’t need any condition-
ing liquid, unless for quicker burn-
ing you want to apply a solution
of saltpetre (one teaspoonful to a
pint of soft boiled-water) by
means of a spray. Spread it out
thinly on trays for the air to
moisten it. Leave it for three
days and, after making into
cigarettes, put the finished product
in a temperately heated room for
24 hours... .E.8.R.: Largest com-
mercial gramophone-record library
in the world is at the 8.8. C. One,
and sometimes three or more,
copies of every record issued in
Britain are sent to the library.
There are 500 different makes and
thousands of numbers. Any one
of the half-million records can be
found in less than 40 seconds by
means of a huge card-catalogue
showing some 180,000 titles,
18,000 composers and nearly
35,000 artists. An average of
11,000 records is issued to 8.8. C.
producers each month... .W.V.S.:
Doubtful whether the book would
have outstanding monetary value.
You might be able to get a good
price for it from a collector

gibber’ before he let H. go.
This had the double advantage
of humiliating H. and getting
us all whacked afterwards.
Pur the real result, as far as
** excitement went, of the
stoning of H. was not the
whacking of small boys. It
was a much larger thing, noth-
ing less than the stoning of
Charlie Lamb himself!
H. in the course of his fum-
ing against the stable-man told
him that he dared not throw a
stone at Lamb, at which the
stable-man got very red in his
sunburnt bloodless face, and
swore by all his patron saints
and others that he would stone
f° r a threepenny-bit. An
obliging youngster went and
told Lamb. I -d» not know
what Lamb said, but he. must
have expressed; some doubt of
the stable-man s courage, be-
cause the next thing I heard
was that Lamb was stuck-up at
the fence, and the stable-man
was stoning him.
I doubt if I was ever in my
life more impressed. We all
rushed to the fence, and there
it was, the incredible sight—
Charlie Lamb standing at the
fence, white with rage, and the
stable - man equally furious
throwing gibbers and brick-
bats at him. It did not last
very long, and I fancy the
stable-man took care not to
goad his opponent to any acts
of desperation by hitting hard,
But the effect was all that he
could wish; his prestige stood
f ar above any possibility of a
rival for the rest of his time at
Southey’s,
That, by the way, was not
very long. What he was sacked
for I never knew in full; there
was probably a large choice of
charges.
NTy impression is that we
were at Southey’s in the time
G f t j lat stable-man a very foul-
mouthed crew of young raga-
muffins. This bad language
W as a very great shock to me
when I first came from home,
jj seemed so much more wicked
than anything I had imagined
before; in some ways it seemed
more important than other
things that were really more
serious. It was the badge of
that “manly” vicious way of
looking at the world which was
the ideal of life to many. I
was once or twice criticised for
not swearing, and felt myself
something of an outcast in con-
sequence.
T>r£tty soon I made a bargain
A with the powers above. In
order to be less unpopular 1
deliberately swore at every
second sentence. I gave up the
practice soon afterwards in
consequence of a remark of
Willie Watt’s. We were cross-
ing a paddock together, and I
advised that we should take the
road “because the damned
grass was so blasted wet.” Watt
was older than I—he must have
been about thirteen. He said
he didn't see the good of swear-
ing when you weren't angry; he
didn’t like the habit of swear-
ing at every sentence. I was so
delighted to hear my own senti-
ments from another that I
agreed with him warmly, at
which he seemed surprised and
asked why I swore so much. It
had never occurred to me be-
fore that when I was swearing
in order to please people, any-
one could actually be dis-
pleased with me for that very
reason.
I thought pretty often of
running away, but do not think
that I told anyone of my plan,
There were many obstacles in
the way, the first being that I
did not know the way to the
railway-station,

and I should find it hard to
say what exactly we were afraid
of, but I did feel the terror, and
many boys were driven to fury
by continued small cruelties,
One curious case occurred a
few weeks after my first arrival
at the school,
There was a tall, fair boy
called Archie, about seventeen,
I always liked him, principally
because of his appearance,
though he was generally not
very popular and was some-
times taunted for being
“English”; I do not know why.
He used to bully one Nichols,
a small, dark, freckled fellow,
older by a little than himself,

A replica of the Olympic Torch burned
brightly on the veranda-roof of the
Metro Theatre, Bourke Street, when the
premiere of the film “Please Don t Eat
The Daisies,” was held to raise funds
for Austrklia’s Olympic team. The
Governor and Lady Brooks were re-
ceived by the president of the Victorian
Olympic Council Sir Wilfred Kent
Hughes, and Lady Kent Hughes,
Olympic committee - member W. T. J.
Uren and Mrs. Uren, premiere com-
mittee-chairman Mrs. John Chaldjian,
and the manager of the theatre Mr. S.
Freeman. Many famous athletes were in
the 25-strong guard-of-honor.
Lady Brooks wore a slim sheath-frock
of white, silver-embroidered lace featur-
ing a wide panel of white tulle falling
from the back of the square neckline.
Lady Kent Hughes chose a short slim-
fitting frock of dusty-pink satin patterned
with large grey roses, Mrs. Chaldjian a
frock of white faille worn with a theatre-
coat of cyclamen silk-shantung. Other
official guests included Chief Justice Sir
Edmund Herring and Lady Herring,
Mrs. Henry Bolte, Lord Mayor Bernard
Evans and Mrs. Evans, and Italian Con-
sul-General the Marchese Serafini.
* ☆ *
The Governor, accompanied by Lady
Brooks (who wore a white Arctic-fox
stole with her gown of turquoise-blue
satin), launched the special appeal for
the building of the new Royal Children’s
Hospital, to cost over four-millions, of
which £400,000 is to be raised by the hos-
pital’s board of management this year.
This appeal will go on till the end of May.
On the dais with the vice-regal couple
were the Premier, Mrs. Bolte and Lord
Mayor Bernard Evans and Mrs. Evans.
Lady Murdoch, president of the hospital,
and the chairman of the hospital finance-
committee, Donald Ferguson, welcomed
the official visitors.

No longer is heard the clatter of feet
as latecomers arrive at the Town Hall
for a celebrity concert. Carpet, with
thick rubber under-surface, softens every
aisle, and its rich green toning blends
into the color-scheme of the main
concert-hall. And squeakless chairs have
replaced the old groaning horrors. These
comforts were in evidence at the concert
in which the Italian violinist Gioconda
de Vito was soloist in the Brahms D
Major Concerto with the Victorian
Symphony Orchestra. Madame de Vito
wore a long, graceful gown of black
velvet spotted in cyclamen velvet, the
fitting bodice having a simple round neck
and short sleeves, the skirt cut to show
fullness at both sides. In the audience
were Mrs. Walter Cass, Mrs. John West,
Mrs. Charles Mackerras, Mrs. John
McCallum, Mrs. John Rutherfors,
pianist Vera Bradford, Dr. and Mrs.
Ivan Maxwell, Mrs. Herbert Brookes,
Mrs. Horace Stevens and Dr. and Mrs.
W. Wark.
Carol Virginia, younger daughter of
well-known journalist Geoffrey Tebbutt,
and Mrs. Tebbutt, of Toorak, has
announced her engagement to John, only
son of Mr. and Mrs. J. K. Potter, of
St. Kilda. The wedding will take place
on April 23 at St. John’s Church, Toorak,
and the reception will be held at the
Hotel Windsor. Carol was educated at
the C. of E. Girls Grammar School, her
fiance at Blundell’s, in Devon (Eng.) and
at London University. He is with his
father in a building-business. Carol’s
ring is a lovely sapphire with diamond-
shoulders. John Warlow photo.
Imaginative and striking were the
decorations of the Royale Ballroom
when the energetic Wool Ball Commit-
tee staged their Leap Year Ball. The
darkened foyer represented a cave from
the ceiling of which bats swayed ; at
the end of the ballroom was a dinosaur
with a caveman perched on its back and
with clouds of steam coming from its
nostrils, whilst on the pillars supporting
the ballroom were clever posters of wild
cavewomen. Meg Harris (who has since
married Gordon Robertson) designed
the. decorations with a small com-
mittee, and David Tresise did the elec-
trical work and supervised erection of
the decorations.
Attending were Mr. Eugene Gorman,
Q.C., president of the Opportunity
Clubs ; Mr. and Mrs. Cecil Greaves (she
wearing a gown comprising a pastel-
pink guipure-lace bodice and short full
skirt of white tulle); Mrs. Marjorie
Burke, in a full-skirted frock of hyacinth-
blue French-lace ; ball-committee presi-
dent Elizabeth Mildred (whose lovely
gown of sea-green chiffon was scattered
with tiny diamentes); Penny Lane (wear-
ing a slim full-length gown of white
satin); Jane Hennessey (former presi-
dent of the committee); and ticket-
secretaries Trish Christian, Sue Faull,
Anne Neville Smith and Sandra Shipton.
All proceeds were in aid of the Ramsay
Mailer Opportunity Club.

Guests at the late-afternoon party at
Majella given by the Victorian Sym-
phony Orchestra subscribers’ committee
were disappointed that indisposition pre-
vented the attendance of Madame
Gioconda de Vito, the Italian violinist.
Her husband, David Bicknell, repre-
sented her. The other guest-of-honor,
conductor Charles Mackerras, was
accompanied by his wife. Guests were
welcomed by committee-president J.
Howard King and Mrs. King, she wear-
ing a bright-blue-and-white-patterned
frock with a small white hat. Among
the guests were Italian Consul-General
the Marchese Serafini, Mrs. Henry
Searby, Mrs. Guy Bakewell (in white-
spotted coral-pink silk frock), Mr. and
Mrs. J. Matheson, Dr. and Mrs. John
O’Donoghue, Mrs. Barbara Gilruth and

When Barbara, youngest daughter of
Mr. and Mis. Douglas Stone, of Haw-
thorn, was married to Colin Reginald,
fourth son of Mr. and Mrs. Reginald
Curnow, of Murwillumbah (N.S.W.), at
All Saints, Kooyong, she wore a gown
of white embroidered-linen beaded with
seed-pearls and crystals. The full-length
tulle-veil was held with sprigs of lily-
of-the-valley, and a trail of white hydran-
gea and pink fuchsias fashioned the
bouquet. Mrs. Tony Arnold, Sarah Lux-
ton and Janet Sayle attended the bride
in frocks of cloud-pink cotton-shantung
which had round necklines, bows down
the back of the bodice and bell-shaped
skirts. They carried trails of white
hydrangea and pale-pink roses. John
Valder, of Sydney, was best man, and
Tony Arnold and Don Petersen were
groomsmen. The reception for 140 guests
was held at No. 9 Darling Street. The
bride's mother wore a peacock-green gui-
pure-lace frock, a matching satin coat
and a small hat of pastel-tinted flowers
Mrs. Curnow added to her mushroom-
pink lace frock a matching fine-veiling
fascinator.

To express his appreciation of all
those who had worked to make the
12th Congress of the Institute of Scien-
tific Management a success, Angus A.
Jones, president of the Melbourne divi-
sion of the Australian Institute of
Management, with Mrs. Jones gave a
delightful cocktail-party at Menzies’
Hotel. Noted among the 100 guests
were ladies’-committee chairman Lady
Storey (wearing a large green velvet hat
swathed in lighter green chiffon with
her black satin cocktail-frock), Mrs.

SYDNEY
This seems to be Nostalgia Week in
Sydney, with various events and bits of
news stirring-up recollections of times
past, and recalling anecdotes of an
earlier Sydney seen through a rosy mist.
☆ ☆ ☆
One such news-item was that we are
to have an Her Majesty’s Theatre once
more. J. C. Williamson have decided to
re-name the Empire Theatre for the
opening date of “My Fair Lady” on
May 21. Extensive alterations are to be
made (seats taken out, a bigger foyer,
etc.), and the name Her Majesty’s will
remain to revive the memory of that
former Her Majesty’s which was fare-
welled with Our Glad, “The Maid of
the Mountains,” tears, memories and
sighs in 1932 to make way for a certain
chain-store.

Then there is the presence in town
of M. Chevalier, whose charm has
justified all expectations. At the dinner
at Chequers arranged by the Black and
White Ball committee for the Royal
Blind Society, Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere
said that he had been her pin-up boy
for... .(pause)... .“quite a considerable
time,” and the roomful of people seemed
to echo “Me, too!” Maurice thanked
and praised all the performers indi-
vidually. They had given their services
free to ?.id the blind, as had the staff
and management of Chequers, and such
acknowledgement from so famous a per-
former must have given them a nice
warm feeling round about the cockles
of the heart (whatever they may be).

Then again, nostalgic in an inverted
sort of way, is the revival of “The Boy
Friend” by Rowe Street Musicals,
scheduled for April 21 and 22 at the
Conservatorium. “The Boy Friend” is
a skit on the 1920 musical “The Girl
Friend” (from which one line sticks
firmly in the memory: “Isn't she cute?
Isn’t she sweet? She’s gentle, and men-
tally nearly complete”). The Rowe
Street group doesn’t go back to the ’2os,
but it does come-of-age this year and
has a proud record of graduates to pro-
fessional theatre, including no fewer than
five members of the present Borovansky
Ballet. “The Boy Friend” should be a
good thing to see.
☆ ☆ ☆
Pink carnations were handed-out to
guests at the Ensemble Theatre’s open-
ing night for “Orpheus Descending,” and
there was quite a gala atmosphere. Mr.
Ray Maher, M.L.A., and Mrs. Maher
were there, Mr. and Mrs. Richard B.
Joyce (U.S. Information Officer), the
Mayor of North Sydney, Aid. J. V.
Bugler, and Mrs. Bugler. Mr. T. W. Chu
(of Caulfield, Vic., who made a special
trip for the opening, as he had designed
the present theatre), Brian Dunlop and
Chica Lowe (he designed the Tennessee
Williams paintings in the foyer), Mr. and
Mrs. Frank Teeman, Hilda and Barbara
Lane Mullins (Edgecliff), the John
Grahams (Coogee), and Mr. and Mrs. A.
Lawlor, whose daughter Robin has an
important role in the play.
Promising young Sydney actress Sheila
Kennedy is a member of the company
which, sponsored by the Arts Council,
will present the stirring drama “A View
From the Bridge” in 101 centres through-
out N.S.W. and Queensland in the near
future. The trip, which begins on April
24, will take them over 9000 miles in five
months and will include centres as far
apart as Cairns (Qld.) and Cabramurra
on the Snowy (N.S.W.), the highest point
in Australia. The 10 members of the
company will travel by the council’s new
motor-unit which takes the players, the
costumes and the props.
Sheila, who is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. G. H. Smith, of Balgowlah, has
chosen her mother’s maiden name of
Kennedy for her stage-career —a name
that is connected with music and the
theatre in England, from which she came
with her parents 10 years ago. She was
building-up a successful career in radio
and advertising when the lure of the stage
called her, and, following her appear-
ances at the Independent Theatre, she
made a great success in the Elizabethan’s
“Rape of the Belt." Though in her early
twenties, Sheila has been cast for older
women in her most important roles. In
“View From the Bridge” she plays the
mother. Not only is she looking forward
to the adventure of helping to bring good
drama to so many different parts of Aus-
tralia, she is also keen to see and learn
about the country of her adoption.
One of the most interesting events of
the week was the exhibition of antiques
arranged by the Women’s Pioneer
Society. Lady Woodward, when opening
the exhibition, said that it was very
important for us to preserve our links
with the past and that she and Sir Eric
had been most impressed by an exhibi-
tion of antiques they had seen at Coona-
barabran on a recent visit.
Several members of the committee wore
period-costumes, which were in beautiful
condition. Mrs. Max Halliday looked
very graceful in an embroidered voile
dress of 1898 with lots of fine lace-
insertion and an Alexandra-collar with
pearls. Cafe-au-lait satin buttons, sash
and hem completed the nostalgic picture.
Of a similar period was Mrs. Keith
Arnott’s figured muslin worn with a
plumed hat —a garden-party dress this,
with its Valenciennes-lace and sweeping
train. Mrs. Alan Watson’s peignoir was
of finely-tucked silk with a deep-flounced
petticoat of lace and a wide lace bertha.
Going all the way back to 1860 were
the brocade dresses worn by youthful
Ann Haxby and Sondra Sedgwick (whose
gold-and-amethyst jewellery had be-
longed to Governor King). Both these
dresses were lent by Mrs. N. J. Baker.
Miss Valerie Cox, who directed the
organising of the exhibition, showed an
opal-glass and silver sugar-basin given
to her family by the first Duke of
Edinburgh (later the family used it as
a christening-bowl). The president of the
society, Mrs. W. A. Rice, lent a pro-
gramme on silk for a concert given by
John Phillip Dean, and the deputy-
president, Mrs. A. D. Barron, brought
from the collection of her uncle, Mr.
Arthur Fisher, a tiny metal lamp which
had been used by the early Christians
(the oldest and surely the most awe-
inspiring of the exhibits).
Everyone paused by the “Grand-
mother” pistol, a two-barrel affair and
tiny enough to clasp in a tiny hand “for
shield against robbers and a fate worse
than death” (with an extra note “now
unusable”). It was lent by Mr .and
Mrs. Badham Jackson, who also lent a
family-bible of 1712.
The copy of the London “Times” for
1815, lent by Mrs. G. S. Simpson, con-
tained many appealing advertisements,
one for the loan of £lOOO. It was
addressed, so the advertiser said, more
to the philanthropist than the money-
jobber!
Other exhibits which captured the
attention included a doll bought at the
Paris Exhibition of 1870 and played-with
by four generations of children, the most
amazing thing about it being its state
of preservation. They must have been
very good children! It was lent by Mrs.
C. Mein.
And a piece that appealed particu-
larly was the small red vase lent by
Judge J. A Ferguson, listed as being
the first piece of pottery ever made in
Australia.

Lit by hundreds of candles in silver

Next Randwick
What promises to be the
most successful autumn race-
meeting at Randwick for many
years begins on Saturday, when
the A.J.C.’s opening-day pro-
gramme includes, as main
attractions the 12-furlongs
£10,250 Randwick Centenary
Invitation Stakes and the seven-
furlongs £7OOO Sires’ Produce
Stakes. Other items on the
attractive card include the six-
furlongs C. W. Cropper Han-
dicap, with the best sprinters
and the mile Princess
Handicap for three-year-old
fillies. The meeting will con-
tinue next Wednesday (April
13) and on Easter Saturday
(April 16), concluding on
Easter Monday, April 18. The
£6OOO Doncaster Handicap and
the Sydney Cup of £12,500 are
listed for the holiday weekend.
Not for many years has such
an array of staying talent been
drawn together as should con-
test the Invitation Stakes. Final
acceptances will close tomor-
row (Thursday), but as most of
the local owners and those
from other States and New
Zealand have their horses in
training at Randwick and at
other Sydney tracks there are
not likely to be many late with-
drawals. And punters will
have form galore to go on. A
field that includes Tulloch,
Macdougal, Froth, Valerius,
Royal Jester, Nilarco, Grand
Garry, Trellios and Bardshah
should alone be enough to
draw a capacity crowd to
Randwick.
* • • *
If Tulloch should be an
absentee, Macdougal, Froth
and Valerius may gather the
big Invitation money, in that
order. v '
The £7OOO A.J.C. Sires’
Produce Stakes (seven furlongs)
looks like going to Sky High,
taking his unbeaten record a
bit further. His win in the
Golden Slipper Stakes at Rose-
hill was most impressive.
Tulloch was seen back to his
grandest in easily winning the
Chipping Norton Stakes at last
Saturday’s Warwick Farm
meeting. The champion hadn’t
raced in Sydney for about two
years, but it was an exercise
outing for him in disposing of
Trellios by an easy three
lengths, with Macdougal a
shade over a length further
“Well, it’s supposed to be the best fishing-spot
on the coast”
back. Trellios came from the
rear of the field, and improved
his Sydney Cup prospects, as
did Macdougal. Trellios has
twice won in Melbourne at
w.f.a., but Macdougal is an
extra-good handicapper, and
will be suited better under such
conditions. Keeping him up
with the leaders in the Chipping
Norton was a style of riding
not suitable to Macdougal;
apparently Mulley thought he
would make it tough for
Tulloch!
• • • •
After the running of the
Chipping Norton Tulloch’s
trainer stated it wasn’t certain
what races the champion would
contest at Randwick. He was
weighted at 9.5 —the maximum
—for the Invitation Stakes, and
would, of course, have an ex-
cellent chance despite the pull
in the weights enjoyed by the
other class stayers. On the
second day (next Wednesday)
Tulloch is one of 17 entrants
for the w.-f.-a. Queen Eliza-
beth Stakes (1| mile), and on
the Saturday following he is
among 16 nominations for the
12-furlongs w.-f.-a. Autumn
Stakes. On the Sydney Cup
Monday he figures among 24
entrants for the mile w.-f.-a.
All-Aged Stakes. The Queen
Elizabeth Stakes and Autumn
Stakes, in which fields will be
small, would be soft snaps
for him. And then it’s likely
to be America for one or two
100,000-dollar events.

Brisbane’s Gulf Boy, winner
of about a dozen races at up
to 12 furlongs, handed out an
encouraging Sydney Cup trial
in winning the Warwick Farm
Autumn Handicap. His time,
2.29.9, compared favorably
with the 12-furlongs track
record, 2.28|, made six years
ago by Euphrates. Gulf Boy
carried Bst. and drops to 7.12
(or 121 b. above the limit! in
the Sydney Cup. Though he
hasn’t won beyond 12 furlongs,
there is nothing to suggest he
won’t get two miles. He won
at 12 furlongs at Eagle Farm
on January 1 in 2.27 J-, a track
record. At Warwick he was
ridden a stylish race by youth-
ful apprentice D. Ferris, lead-
ing rider in Brisbane this sea-
son. By a fine stayer and sire
of stayers Royal Empire
(Fr.) —Gulf Boy is from Royal
Lineage by Harinero (imp.)
from Princess Rose (imp.) by
Rose Prince.
Pique, stylish winner of the
w.-f.-a. Chelmsford Stakes at
Randwick last spring, and
placed in three races in New
Zealand in January this year,
had an easy victory in the
Warwick Farm mile Sappho
Stakes for three-year-old fillies.
She has a round of engage-
ments at Randwick and looks
like adding to stakemoney.
Her run on Saturday stamped
her a brilliant filly.
Among the odds-on shots
beaten at the Farm, Martello
Towers ran a great race for
a nose defeat by the second-
elect, Man of Iron. Martello
Towers drops from the 9.5
he carried to 8.11 in the Don-
caster. At this stage his chief
opponents look like being In
Love, Man of Iron and the
better of the stablemates
French Descent and Turkestan
(third and fourth in the War-
wick event). French Descent
might have won that sprint
had he secured a clear run in
the straight. He goes up lib.
to 7.7 % and could be a light-
weight show in the big mile.
Turkestan, on 7.12, will carry
the same weight as at the
Farm.
Persian Lyric was much too
solid for the other two-year-
olds in the Warwick Fairfield
Handicap. He came from the
rear of the field and, despite
his 9st., ran home clearly from
Royal Emblem (who ran his
race in patches), with King of
the Castle (slow to begin) a
distant third.

At Caulfield
There are not many two-mile
events on the Australian Turf
calendar —not nearly enough,
in this writer’s opinion. One
of the few is the St. Kilda
Handicap run at Caulfield by
the V.A.T.C., and won last
Saturday by the four-year-old
mare Trueform, who has sud-
denly come into prominence
as a stayer. On the last day
of the V.R.C.’s autumn meet-
ing she came from a long way
back to win the 14-furlongs
Flemington Handicap. That
was her best form up to then,
and she showed further im-
provement on Saturday to hold
a good position throughout
and run on gamely to win
well. No wonder she can
stay! She’s by Carbon Copy
from Furies by Hellespont
(Fr.) from Daughter of the
Wind by that grand stayer
Windbag. She is the kind to
improve with age, and we may
see her doing well next spring,
in better company.
Not many owners can get
quite the same pleasure from
seeing their colors first past the
post as the McLachlans, of
Adelaide. Their registered
colors are the tartan of the
McLachlan clan, with a white
sash and cap—the colors that
White Nose carried to victory
in the 1931 Melbourne Cup.
White Nose was owned by
H. P. McLachlan ; his sons,
I. and A.P., race the promis-
ing Muirfield, who scored his
third win from only three
starts when he defeated a
rather good field in the mile
Katandra Two-year-old. The
McLachlans bred Muirfield, a
gelding by Coronation Boy
from Seawitch, and he’s
trained in Victoria by Fred
Hoysted, who intends to spell
him now, with the important
spring races for three-year-olds
in view.
Proponder, now a six-year-
old, is in the best form of his
career; he was untroubled to
beat a smart sprinter in Prince
Lea in the six-furlongs South
Yarra Handicap, cutting out
the 5| furlongs in 1.9 f. The
race was a Doncaster trial for
Prince Lea, but Proponder
beat him with a lot in hand.
Proponder will be set for the
rich winter racing in Brisbane,
with the Stradbroke and the
Doomben £lO,OOO likely to be
in his programme.
With his aristocratic breed-
ing—by Helios (imp.) out of
that grand mare Tranquil
Star, who was by Gay
Lothario (imp.) from Lone
Star—one would have expected
Tranquil Glow to be a Cup
horse. Instead, he has made
his mark as a steeplechaser.
But at least he’s a good one.
On Saturday 11.4 did not stop
him from winning the Gordon
Steeplechase for the third year
in succession, rather remark-
able for a ’chaser who is now
only a six-year-old. What is
more, he equalled the course
record, 3.41 T Tranquil Glow’s
target is the Great Eastern
Steeplechase at Oakbank on
Easter Monday.
Saranover, now a five-year-
old entire, and by Sunstorm
from Comtesse, certainly
deserved his win in the Caul-
field Kooyong Handicap. In
the spring he ran seconds
against good company in the
Final Handicap at Flemington
and in the Williamstown Cup,
and at his first run this time
up he was second to Gay Saba
in the Lloyd Stakes. He is
more than useful, and might
well win the Sandown Cup,
second leg of the traditional
Easter double, with the Vic-
toria Handicap the first leg.
A coming winner from the
Kooyong is former Sydney
horse labin. He ran a very
promising third. Hyleena, stick-
ing on better these days, could
give a sight in the Victoria
Handicap.
Other Sports
With the grounds just nicely
softened by a spot or two of
overnight rain, Sydney foot-
ballers got into their strides
and fairly promisingly into
their stride in all codes last
Saturday. In Rugby Union
what had looked like being
the pick of the day—Northern
Suburbs v. Gordon at North
Sydney—proved a bit of a let-
down, Norths (mainly per
Dowse’s goaling) winning it
easily 17-3. University—look-
ing a crew that’s going to be
hard to toss —walked over
Parramatta in the Uni. pre-
cincts, 26-6 ; last-year premiers
Randwick had it a trifle
tougher to beat Eastwood 20-14
in an all-in clash ; Manly (10),
beating Drummoyne (6), had
it easier than the scores sug-
gest ; and St. George rather
luckily managed to make it an
8-all draw with Easts.
* * *
If they staged a match in
the middle of the Nullarbor
this season, the ruling St.
George Rugby Leaguers would
still pull, a crowd. In Satur-
day’s polite meeting with
Parramatta (52 to nil ) it was
a shame to take the money.
The hefty Saints are the very
best club side sighted in the
code for many years, and you
have to go a long way back
to find a centre as all-round
brilliant as their Gasnier. In
the other Saturday encounters
Canterbury - Bankstown wal-
loped North Sydney 18-7 in a
good hard game ; Wests hung
onto an early lead long enough
to down Newtown 20-17 ; and

AUSTRALIAN JOCKEY CLUB
Randwick
Centenary
AUTUMN MEETING
1960
SATURDAY - - 9th APRIL
WEDNESDAY - - 13th APRIL
SATURDAY - - 16th APRIL
MONDAY - - _ 18th APRIL
To mark the centenary of his-
toric Randwick Racecourse, the
Australian Jockey Club is staging
the richest carnival ever held in
Australia.
The committee feels that the
record Australian prize-money,
the attractive programme and
champion horses from through-
out the Commonwealth, will
provide the racing public with
the greatest racing carnival ever
staged.
Convenient and comfortable
Randwick Racecourse with its
famed gardens and lawns is oniy
three miles from the heart of the
city.
The Course offers every
amenity, including spacious green
lawns and public stands, open
betting rings, high quality food
in spacious dining rooms and a
steak barbecue.
Randwick Racecourse is well
served by speedy public trans-
port. Special race-day tram
services have been replaced
with bus services. Buses run
from Central Railway (Eddy
Avenue), Circular Quay, Bondi
Junction and King’s Cross to
the special transport platforms
inside the Racecourse.
Normal Services which pass
the Course are supplemented
to ensure that all patrons are
carried quickly and comfortably
to the Racecourse.
Balmain scratchily ditched
Souths 9-2. In a pleasant
Sunday - afternoon punching
contest, more-or-less appro-
priately brawled at the Sports
Ground, Manly kayoed
Easts 9-8.

A good time should certainly
be had by all on this year's
Australian Old Collegians
world tour. They open on
May 1 against British Colum-
bia at Vancouver. Following
Canadian matches, there are to
be matches at Washington,
Philadelphia and a couple in
New York. Thence to Ireland,
Scotland, England (just about
every corner of it) and Wales;
then Paris, Dusseldorf (against
the British Army of the Rhine),
Copenhagen, more Dusseldorf
(2nd Tactical Air Force), Ber-
lin (Combined Services), and so
homewards, via Pakistan and
assorted other addresses where
the inhabitants have cricket-
grounds.

“Bris”: Since even keen cricket
followers - have failed to find a
mention of it, here’s the South
African team to tour England this
coming summer: Jack McGlew
(captain), Trevor Goddard (vice-
captain), Neil Adcock, Peter Carl-
stein, Chris „ Duckworth, Jon
Fellows-Smith, Geoffrey Griffin,
Athol McKinnon, Roy McLean,
Sid O’Linn, Anthony Pithey, James
Pothecary, Hugh Tayfield, John
Waite and Colin Wesley. Seven
of them toured England in S’Africa’s
1955 team. Interesting selection is
that of 20-year-old Geoffrey
Griffin, whose fast-bowling action
has been queried.
“Gelburg”: Some names in
the South African cricket selec-
tions for England are prob-
ably unfamiliar to Australians.
Pithey is a sound opener from
Rhodesia. O’Linn is a left-
hander and a reserve ’keeper;
he has played for Kent. Griffin,
a young Natal find, bowls fast-
medium; lifts and swings each
way. McKinnon is an Eastern
Province left-hand spinner:
English and Australian players
have reckoned him the best of
his type they have met. Carl-
stein, developed tremendously,
could thrill English purists with
his stroke-play.
“Bob Ray”: Full marks to
Alan Davidson and Norman
O’Neill for their sterling per-
formances in the Sydney A-
grade cricket premiership final
between Western Suburbs and.
St. George. Oft-times Test
cricketers let their clubs down
with flat performances after
playing in a Test series. Hence
this word for Davidson
(Western Suburbs) and O’Neill
(St. George), especially after
such an exacting tour as the
one in Pakistan and India.
Davidson made 61 and took 3
for 52; O'Neill scored 108 and
captured 4 for 115. Western
Suburbs won the 1959-60 pre-
miership with its 333 to St.
George’s 214.
• • • •
“Xavier”: Some references
here to close finishes in cricket-
matches recall a freak finish
between Victorian Colts and
Prahran in 1936. The
Colts, needing 24, had 20
minutes to get them, with last
man Owen King at the wicket.
King survived for that time,
and took strike to the last
ball of the match with the
scores level. Attempting the
winning single he was run-out.
The V.C.A.’s ruling was that,
the game being a tie, the teams
shared three points. It also
said that had King not got
out the game would have been
drawn —in which case no
points would have been allotted
under the rules then prevail-
ing. Jn short, King’s dismissal
meant \\ points to his side,
whereas his 'Survival would
have yielded nothing. 1 wonder
if he was aware of this
Gilbertian situation as he faced
that crucial last ball.

GHANA
/Commenting on Ghana’s new
republican Constitution —
widely regarded as dictatorial
in character together with
reports that certain political
offenders in that country were
to be flogged, London “Daily
.Express” asks:
“Who is to blame for this
plight of a former British
colony?” and answers: “The
British Government, which
handed-over power to Nkru-
mah and his henchmen.
“Today that same Govern-
ment, under the leadership of
Mr. Harold Macmillan, hastens
to hand-over other British terri-
tories in Africa to African
politicians. The whole of
colonial policy is governed by
the principle: How quickly can
we get out?
“What motive can there be
for such a course of action?
The motive of pleasing the
Americans? Absurd! For
while Britain is apparently
handing-over control to the
Africans, in truth she is
surrendering control to the
Russians. No thanks from
Washington need be expected
for that.
“By giving so-called self-
government to African popula-
tions too soon Britain will have
allowed these populations to
sink back into ignorance,
squalor and tyranny. And she
will have betrayed, also, the
white people in Africa.
“These white communities
look to Britain for encourage-
ment, but they feel that they
look in vain.”
But, the Manchester
“Guardian” holds, “even sup-
posing that excesses never
occurred under British admini-
stration,” such barbarism “can-
not be an argument against
self-government”:
“The indignation against acts
of this kind [the floggings], and
the moral pressure needed to
stop them, must be generated
spontaneously within the coun-
try concerned. It was not the
rule of a wise and paternal
overlord which stopped the
burning of religious heretics in
this country [Britain],
“British colonialism —this is
its par a d o x —has brought
tremendous benefits to the
people who have lived under it,
but by sheltering them from
the responsibility of making
their own decisions and evolv-
ing further their own codes of
behavior it may have left a
social vacuum which will take
a long time to fill.”
Supporting the “Guardian’s”
—London “Observer.”
“DAMNED SHAME. IF WE HAD THE BOMB, WE
COULD HAVE BEEN IN THAT CONFERENCE.”
line of argument, but referring
particularly to Ghana's new
Constitution, London “Obser-
ver” notes that, although Presi-
dent Nkrumah will soon be
armed with great powers, “he
will have to justify these to his
electorate, who will continue
to exercise their full demo-
cratic rights in five-yearly elec-
tions based on a full universal
franchise.
“In theory, the new Constitu-
tion allows for a free interplay
of democratic forces. Whether
this theory will break-down in
practice depends less on the
form of the Constitution than
on the capacities of a struggling
young nation to make demo-
cracy work.
“The notion of strong-man
Governments is rightly repug-
nant to us. But the sight of
even so mature a country as
France resorting to this all-too-
usual expedient should make
us careful to be fair. This
does not mean not criticising.
It means not forgetting our
lapses from liberalism —such as
currently in Nyasaland—and
not making wild statements
about anyone.”
All very well, says the “York-
shire Post,” but “it is dangerous
to try to maintain a double
ethical standard in any depart-
ment of human life —in politics
just as much as in commerce
or marital relations. Cruelty,
injustice and oppression are
wrong wherever they occur,
and to condemn them in one
country and condone them in
another is false and hypo-
critical.”
Referring to the floggings,
the same paper notes that if
these had been ordered in any
British dependency “the out-
cry here in Britain would be—
justifiably enormous. Ques-
tions would rain in upon the
Colonial Secretary in the House
of Commons, hecklers at by-
elections would make the
Government candidate’s life a
misery, the Left-wing weeklies
would bristle with righteous
indignation.
“It is true that Ghana is a
fully independent member-State
in the Commonwealth and the
United Kingdom Government
has not the slightest responsi-
bility for or control over
Ghana’s affairs. This is also
true of the Union of South
Africa, many of whose actions,
especially in respect of apar-
theid, are strongly disliked by
most people in this country, in-
cluding the Conservative party.
Yet hearken to the clamor
which the Left in Britain have
raised, and continue to raise,
against South Africa!
“The contrast between this
and the silence over Ghana is
all the more startling because
of the laudatory attitude which
the Left are assuming towards
Ghana’s new republican Con-
stitution. Ghana’s, record as
a Parliamentary democracy
since independence has not
been particularly notable; and
the new proposals which are to
come into effect next July sub-
stitute for the failed formalities
of a Parliament the apparatus

Labor's
New Testament
T ondon “Economist” com-
ment on Hugh Gaitskelfs
plan for reform of the British
Labor party’s constitution,
lately submitted to a meeting
of that party’s National Execu-
tive:
“Eleven of the 12 points that
he [Gaitskell] originally sub-
mitted to the executive were
expressions of high-flown sen-
timents with which almost
everybody could agree, chiefly
because most of them have no
relevance to possible State
action; nobody is going to vote
against ‘the brotherhood of
man,’ but no Government
decree is going to bring it
about, either. Even the part
of these 11 points that do
pretend to affect future State
policy would be accepted by
most people, though the advan-
tage of writing them into a
party constitution is obscure,
“But the immediate attention
of the country is inevitably
being concentrated on the 12th
point—on the new testament’s
wording about nationalisation.
As the clause has.finally been
amended by the executive, Mr.
Gaitskell has been constrained
to say that he
is convinced that all these social
and economic objectives can be
achieved only through the exten-
sion of common ownership sub-
stantial enough to give the
community power over the com-
manding heights of the economy,
including State-owned industries
and firms. Producer and Consumer
Co-operation, Municipal Owner-
ship, and public participation in
private concerns. In recognising
that both public and private enter-
prise have a place in the economy,
[Labor] believes that further
extensions of common ownership
should be decided from time to
time in the light of these
objectives....
“If Mr. Gaitskell really be-
lieved enthusiastically that a
‘substantial’ dose of all these
dog-biscuity doctrines was the
only way to achieve his social
and economic objectives there
would be room for interesting
debate with him. But every-
body knows that he does not
believe this; he believes wearily
that proclaiming them is the
only way of appeasing his mili-
tants. And this must raise the
question of how long this in-
telligent man, and the intelli-
gent coterie around him, can
bear to put-up with the in-
tellectual indignities of their
present position.”
A like concern is expressed
by the Manchester “Guardian”:
“Clause 4 [which uncondi-
tionally committed Labor to
nationalisation] is a symbol. To
Labor militants it is a symbol
that the party is still fighting
the good fight against ‘capital-
ism.’ To uncommitted voters it
is a symbol that a strong fac-
tion in the Labor party has not
yet learnt that ‘capitalism’ has
changed since 1918. Hence
the ferocity of the battle over
Mr. Gaitskelfs amendments.
“The Left thought that if
their sacred texts were altered it
would be a sign that the party's;
faith had been watered down.
The Right thought that if old
dogmas were not surrendered
the party would never con-
vince the electorate that it lives
in the modern world. Until
Mr. Gaitskelfs proposed draft
became public the suspicions
of the Left had some faint
justification. [At the executive
meeting] they were exploded.
Mr. Gaitskelfs draft, although
bounded by a wider horizon
than the old Clause 4. sur-
rendered nothing of the spirit
of British Socialism. All it
did was to bring the language
up to date.
“But Mr. Gaitskell did not
manage to overcome the oppo-
sition, and potential Labor
voters may be deterred, once
again, by the suspicion that the
Labor party is still living in a
political never-never land.
Some people in the party talk
as though this does not matter.
Principle, they say, comes
before power—and, in any
case, radical parties can only
expect to win office once every
30 years.
“That may be. But the
Labor party has won office,
only once in 60 years. The
‘onward march’ about which
Labor speakers used to peror-
ate ground to a halt 10 years
ago. Since then the march has
been backwards.
“The sociological tides seem
to be set against Labor, not in
its favor. The traditional work-
ing-class .is becoming extinct.
Unless it can win votes from
other sections of society, the
Labor party may become as
much a quaint old relic of the
past as Andy Capp.”

There is something geometrical in the pattern
of human progress. Every age rises higher and
broader on the base of knowledge and discovery.
The years we are living are really amazing in
what they have been producing in extension of the
design. Fruitful as the 1950’s were in expansion
for Australia and progress for the world, we can
enter this hew decade with an even stronger Faith
blended in satisfactions of the past and hopes for
the future.
But that Belief will need to be livened by an
eagerness to apply our spiritual and moral strength
to the material blessings we find around us.
Australia’s natural resources will avail us only so
long as we are bold in our determination to
use them.
It is a law of life that action governs
performance. The most powerful machine, for
instance, is only another inert object until it is
put into operation. Its value is in the power it
brings to the task for which it was designed
and made.
Similarly, in the realm of the mind, an idea
is only an idea unless it can be put into practice.
Australia is a unit of both mind and matter.
It has strength to draw upon; its reserves of human
power are growing. More than one-and-a-quarter
million people should be added to our work-force
in the 1960’5. They will represent more than a
numerical increase. With them will come added
skills and training—and most of all, the spirit of
enthusiasm and enterprise without which any
estimate of manpower would be merely a figure.
High and efficient production, expanded trade,
the ensurement of happy standards —these are
important in the making of our material future.
But in the next ten years and the numberless
years that will follow, the true scale of Australia’s
greatness will be measured less by what we have
than by what we are.

or 6.8 per cent, of total pro-
ceeds, to £16.7 million, equiva-
lent to 10 per cent., according
to calculations made by the
National Bank of Australasia.
“Although only 325,0001 b.
of greasy wool was shipped to
the U.S.S.R. over the whole of
1958-59, exports to that coun-
try during the first six months
of 1959-60 rose to 14,879,0001 b.,
valued at £4.5 million. Another
Eastern European country
which showed a substantial
increase in her imports of
Australian greasy wool was
Czechoslovakia, with shipments
of 14.6-million lb. during the
second half of 1959, compared
with 8.8-million lb. during the
corresponding period of 1958.”
Two New Liners
T ondon “Economist” takes
a look at the specifica-
tions for the Orient Line’s
Oriana (40,000 tons) and P. &
O.’s Canberra (45,000 tons),
two new liners expected to
provide next year “voyages
linking North America, the
Philippines, Hong Kong,
Japan, and Australia linked
with its Australian trade, plus
cruises—what P. & O. calls
‘six trades in one’”:
“Both of these liners incor-
porate novel technical develop-
ments, such as the use of all-
welded aluminium superstruc-
tures to reduce weight and
increase accommodation ; but
the Canberra’s designers have
put a particular accent on
innovation.
“The unconventional layout,
with engines aft and officer-
and crew-accommodation for-
ward, leaves a ‘hotel block’
free amidships for passenger-
accommodation ; to avoid the
cargo-trunks that normally
cut through these passenger-
decks to the holds below, two
of the ship’s three cargo-holds
will be loaded sideways, using
a special conveyer system.
“An automatic lift and con-
veyer system, again, will move
baggage pre-selectively between
cabin-decks. Lifeboats, all of
glass fibre, are located, not on
the top deck, but three decks
down, flush with the side of
the ship.
“Plastics are used extensively
in the cabins, both for struc-
tural units such as showers and
for finish; the use of p.v.c.
and melamine surfaces will
mean that no painting will be
needed in cabins throughout
the ship’s life.
“The ship will be fully air-
conditioned, which can be
noisy, and incorporates 17
lifts, plus large amounts of
other powered equipment;
against these, and against the
equally irritating noises that
passengers inflict upon each
other, bulkheads have been
specially designed to be sound-
proof.
“The Oriana, built by
Vickers-Armstrongs, may come
into service by the end of this
year; the Canberra, built by
Harland and Wolff, early next
spring. The group has 16
liners already operating on
these services in the P. & O.
and Orient fleets, which are
now to be integrated in
administration as well as in
operation ; the two new vessels
will add a third class of size
and speed.
“They will not, however, be
tied to a regular round-the-
year service ; they have been
designed to be shifted between
the different linked trades, to
avoid the seasonal slackness
on particular routes, and to
fill-in between with short
cruises. The group is placing
great importance upon develop-
ing custom from American and
Canadian travellers in the
still-developing ‘Orient and
Pacific’ trade.
“Although protective Ameri-
can maritime regulations pre-
clude British liners from
picking-up and delivering
passengers between certain
logical ports, such as San
Francisco and Honolulu, all
the extra tonnage coming onto
the Pacific in recent years has
been British. With the five
liners now taking part in this
service, ‘O. & P.’ has gained
the bulk of the increased
ocean traffic at the expense of
the subsidised American
President and Matson lines; the
two new ones, the group hopes,
will bring it fresh gains.”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Race Suicide ?
One would like to know on
what evidence “Plain Austra-
lian” (B. 9/ 3/ ’6O) bases his
assertion that the three con-
comitants to peace, with our
Asian neighbors are a revised
immigration-policy, the build-
ing-up of mutual trade and in-
creased cultural exchanges.
To begin with the last item:
there was not only a very large
cultural exchange but also a
close cultural tie between Eng-
land and Germany before
World War I; but that did not
prevent them from going it
hammer-and-tongs with no re-
gard whatever for Shakspeare
or Darwin or Goethe or Wag-
ner or even the brothers
Grimm. In fact, there always
have been cultural exchanges
between the European nations,
and always wars. The culture
of the English and that of the
American colonies was identi-
cal, yet England and the
colonies fought.
Nor is war discouraged by
trade. It is regarded as a tem-
porary interruption to trade,
and very often the hope is that
trade advantages will be among
the spoils of victory. Posses-
sion of a source of trade can
secure the trade. That is what
England felt when she built-up
her Empire. And we traded
extensively with Japan before
the last war.
As for arguing that there is
any relation between peace and
the admission of quotas of
foreigners into a country —that
is like telling a child that eat-
ing his crusts will make his
hair curl.
There was a large influx of
French refugees into England
during the reign of Elizabeth I,
but history was still spotted
with wars between the English
and the French for centuries
after. There was a large intake
of Japanese and a still larger
intake of Germans and Italians
by the U.S. before World War
“Men are not lacking who have the courage to dress
according to Sydney's tropical climate if only the
Wretched Weather Would give us a go!"
11, but that did not seem to
promote friendly relations be-
tween the U.S. and the respec-
tive fatherlands. There were
German settlements in Austra-
lia before the world wars; but
just what was the feeling to-
wards Germans during the wars
some may be able ‘to remem-
ber.
Before World War II there
was agitation by the Universal
Brothers to allow Japanese im-
migrants freely into this coun-
try, and even a suggestion that
we give the Northern Territory
to Japan. It would be interest-
ing to know if it is the con-
templation of what would have
been Australia’s fate, had the
Universal Brothers had their
way then, that inspires them to
try to accomplish in the future
what they failed to bring about
that time. If we call a smug
sacrificing of our own people
“idealism,” it is time the word
was dropped from the lan-
guage.
The strange yearning for
race-suicide that very many
white people have at present is
perturbing. —D. Watts
(N.S.W.).
Legal Precedents
Surprise expressed by legal
observers when Mr. Justice
McClemens, in the N.S.W.
Supreme Court, acquitted an
accused man after the jury
had failed to agree reminded
me of a case in which the judge
discharged a man accused of
manslaughter without even
calling on the jury for a ver-
dict.
This case, which occurred
about 40 years ago, was most
unusual. It concerned Captain
Sydney Hannaford Drew, of
the North Coast Steam Naviga-
tion Company’s steamer Tin-
tenbar, who was shooting
at birds on the Clarence
River while his vessel was
moored to a Grafton wharf. A
bullet ricocheted from the
water and struck a man and
his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Harry
Long, who were driving in a
sulky along a road in South
Grafton, about three-quarters
of a mile away.
Captain Drew knew nothing
about the incident until police
questioned him later and took
possession of the .303 Lee-
Enfield rifle which he admitted
having used. The Navy issued
rifles of this type to masters of
ocean-going vessels at the time
for use in destroying floating
mines, which were still a danger
to shipping after World War I.
At the inquest on the deaths
of Mr. and Mrs. Long, Dr.
William Page, brother of Sir
Earle Page, described how the
bullet had entered Long's head,
severing the spinal cord, and
had then pierced Mrs. Long's
heart The Longs had been
driving at right-angles to the
point from which the bullet
had been fired, and the police
described the accident as a
million-to-one chance.
Drew was committed for
trial at Grafton, but the Crown,
believing that public opinion
there might be against him,
changed the venue to Darling-
hurst, where Drew came before
Judge Scholes and a jury on
November 21, 1919.
After hearing the evidence
Judge Scholes discharged the
jury under section 24 of the
Crimes Act, without calling on
it for a verdict, and this
operated automatically as an
acquittal.
Drew, who had all along
been greatly distressed by the
fatal shooting, left the court a
broken man. —M. F. Dixon
(N.S.W.).
Buried History
A wealth of interesting his-
torical data must be going ter
waste throughout Australia in
the form of family letters and
other papers stowed away in
old homes.
What can be done with such
material is shown by Mary
Durack in her latest book,
Kings in Grass Castles, which
tells of the pioneering Duracks,
their kin the Costellos, and
other relatives.
Not all of our pioneers had
such colorful careers, but many
had lives as interesting in their
way as those of the Duracks
Other books of this nature
have been published, but in-
terest in true stories of the
pioneers is bound to quicken
as the population increases, and
there should be room for re-
prints of the best of works
already published and for new
volumes.
Another angle is that records
of family history are records of

James Mahoney (N.S.W.).
Building-blocks
Prospective home-builders
should certainly take to heart
the repeated warnings by Vic-
toria’s Minister for Housing
on inflated prices for building-
blocks in and around Mel-
bourne (Plain English,
16/3/ ’6O).
But it's pointless to hark
back nostalgically to times
when land was plentiful and
calculate on cost-of-living
figures what blocks should be
worth today.
If it seems absurd that
building-allotment prices have
intreased tenfold in a single
decade, the fact must be faced
that the demand for good
suburban sites, with essential
services, has far outstripped
the supply. In and around
Melbourne land-development,
with provision of roads, gas
and sewerage, has lagged
behind the needs of a rapidly
expanding population.
It’s not much use blaming
“I’m afraid I'll have to move from Mascot."
the landowner for demanding
the full market price. He's as
much entitled to it as the
holder of any commodity is to
receive its current value as
determined by supply and
demand.
Nothing much can be done
short of compulsory Govern-
ment acquisition of unused
blocks at below-market valua-
tions —a practice that brought
down public opprobrium on
the Housing Commission some
years back and is politically
too dangerous to be tried
again. In any case there
wouldn't be enough really
cheap blocks to go round,
even if unused land in the
inner suburbs were acquired.
The average young couple
with limited finance must look
to the outer areas ; and it is
the sale of so-called “building-
allotments” in those areas that
calls for some measure of
control in the public interest,
Subdivision of large estates
with full provision of roads,
drains and services is one
thing; estate-development in
conjunction with home-build-
ing has contributed largely
towards keeping down housing-
costs in Victoria during recent
years. But it is quite another
thing to palm-off on credulous
young couples “building-
blocks” in subdivisions where
roads have been merely
“formed,” drainage may be
inadequate, and gas, water and
sewerage may not be available
for five years or so.
Unfortunately, this type of
“development” has been per-
mitted and is likely to con-
tinue so long as it remains
profitable. No one likes con-
trols on land-sales ; but here,
surely, is a case where restric-
tions are desirable.
At least, vendors of un-
developed land should be
compelled to offer it for sale
as such, and should be required
to declare in their advertise-
ments and contract-documents
precisely what services (if any)
are available. Further, it
should be made a condition
for the subdivision of land
for building that certain essen-
tial services be provided by
the vendor within a specified
period.
If Victoria's Minister for
Housing saw fit to investigate
the possibility of protecting
would-be home-owners along
these lines he would earn their
gratitude.— Wusslean (Vic.).

cutting his name on a desk with
a large penknife. Archie came
in and, as he passed Nichols,
clouted his head.
This was not an unusual
greeting from a bigger boy to
i smaller; however, I suppose
Archie had been bullying
Michols before, and Nichols
was in a smouldering rage, for
as I looked carelessly up I was
amazed to see Nichols leap to
his feet with his teeth gleam-
ing and stab furiously at
.Archie’s breast.
Archie knocked the hand
down as it came and the knife
stuck in his thigh. He hit
Nichols full in the face with
his fist, sending him over on
the floor, pulled out the knife
and then stripped off his
breeches. He wore a belt and
the breeches were off in less
than a minute, but by that time
his leg was bathed in blood;
I remember the little spout that
came when he first pulled the
knife out. He was taken into
another room and bandaged.
THE affair was prudently
hushed-up. Archie was sup-
posed to have got a big splinter
into his leg while straddling a
fence; this hushing-up was
somehow attributed to
generosity on Archie’s part
and made an extra reproach
against Nichols; he was abused,
baited and bullied not only by
Archie, but by anyone who
felt the spirit move him in that
direction. Especially Smith,
the biggest and most brutal of
bullies in after time, took to
making little boys kick Nichols
and call him names. ' Nichols
used to wander away when
school was over, as many a
boy afterwards wandered away
from Smith.
Smith’s bullying in later
years took a peculiar form.
At the beginning of term he
would select a particular victim
and arrange that he should
never see him without making
him cry. Of course the victim
as soon as. he got out of school
would run away and hide in
s6me remote place. “Smithie,”
as he was affectionately called,
would sometimes, if there was
nothing more amusing to do,
go after him and make him
cry—which was pretty easy by
that time; mostly he was con-
tent to see the terror he in-
spired.
I Went once or twice to try
and comfort one of these
victims, but it was not any
good. One of them, I remem-
ber, once turned on me in
That was “Beakie”; I forget his
real name. Another, Deghe,
actually ran away and lived for
a couple of nights in the bush.
When caught he brought with
him the leg of an opossum he
had killed and roasted. He
was beaten before the whole
school for his offence, but of
course it brought him more
glory than blame.
At last—it sounds absurd —
the bright thought occurred
to me that I might commit
suicide and be free from all
troubles. It was not that in a
paroxysm of self-pity I thought
“Well, I’ll kill myself and then
they’ll be sorry.” It was much
more the simple old Stoic con-
ception: “Think of yourself in
a room that gets smoky, most
rooms are rather smoky ; but
remember, if yours gets too
smoky you can always go out.”
I got hold of a rope so as to be
able to hang myself. There
was no particular hurry, how-
ever, and the feeling of relief,
of mastery over circumstances,
which the thought of my plan
gave me, made me really a good
bit happier than I had been
before. I remember Ted Hick-
son saying that I was not half
a bad little beast; but the im-
provement was only due to the
cheerfulness which came from
my new secret.
Oddly enough, it was Ted
Hickson and his brother Snowie
who had the chief part in
changing my resolution. I got
away from the other fellows
one hot summer’s day, cloud-
less, with the sand baking un-
derfoot, and went with my
rope to a tree that I had
selected beforehand. I climbed
up to the first branch with
some difficulty fastened the
rope round the branch and
round my neck, let it come
loose and then jumped off.
I was partly rehearsing,
partly play-acting to deceive
myself. Then, as I thought
how to do it better if 1 were
to try again, a bulldog-ant
stung me. This diverted my
thoughts ; I found I was on a
nest of these ants.
“What the deuce are you
doing there?” called out Ted
Hickson who came up just at
this moment from the bush.
I showed him the ants and we
killed a good many together.
This interrupted me for the
day ; and I am told that even a
real suicide' once interrupted
seldom repeats his attempt,
much less a sham suicide like
me.
TTowever this may have been,
I got up early next morn-
ing and went down by my-
self to a big walnut-tree
that grew near the stables.
The nuts were green, but
we liked knocking them
down and eating them, and
were allowed to do so as much
as we liked. I was picking and
eating my walnuts happily
enough, when I heard voices
and found that Snowie Hick-
son—also called Charcoal, be-
cause his hair was white —was
coming down the path. I felt
my heart contract with fear ;
I was awfully afraid of Snowie;
why I cannot say. I started to
run, and then on second
thoughts stayed where I was
and waited for the worst.
I shall never forget the joy-
ful surprise I felt when he
spoke to me in a friendly way,
suggesting, I think, that I
should climb up the tree and
throw walnuts down to him to
peel. I was so happy when I
was up that tree, and I did not
care about having my share of
walnuts when I came down. I
was even sorry when the break-
fast-bell rang.
That day I went out in the
bush with Snowie, and the next
day with his brother; and I
think I may really say that
from that day I began to a
great extent to be tolerably
happy. Soon after that the
school moved from Moss Vale
to larger buildings near Mitta-
gong, and the number of boys
went up from eleven to seventy
or eighty. I have no acute
memories of misery after the
move to Mittagong ; I suppose
I felt more at home and safer;
indeed, I was now one of the
older inhabitants.
Southey’s was certainly not
a perfect school, but it had its
good points. Southey himself
was a kindly man and a good
scholar; a nephew, I believe, of
the poet. He described himself
as “late Demy of Magdalen
College, Oxford,” a title whicn
sounded well but was really an
admission that he had left
Oxford without taking a degree
—sent down, I heard after-
wards at Magdalen, for per-
sistent gambling. When funds
failed he had played “blind-
hookey” for his furniture.
-However, he was quite good
with boys and not a bad
teacher.

efficient and personable mem-
ber of Shell’s Sydney p-r. staff,
also accompanied the party.
We travelled all night and in
the morning left the train at
Culcairn, bathed and had
breakfast at the Culcairn Hotel
and embussed at 9.15 a.m. in a
coach driven personally by
Clive Fearne, who owns a fleet
of them in Wagga.
Round Hill
First stop was Round Hill,
the property of Anthony Hor-
dern, jnr., which lies a couple
of miles outside Culcairn.
Originally settled in 1847,
when Creighton and Hill took-
up a lease of 90,000 acres, the
property was later in the pos-
session of the Hentys and
Balfours. Balfours held it for
more than 100 years, enduring,
around 1863, several raids from
Morgan the bushranger.
Anthony Hordern, jnr.,
formed a company, Round Hill
Pty., Ltd., which bought the
property in 1952. Now, on the
3500 acres, there are 700 head
of cattle, the Herewai Romney
Marsh stud and Mrs. Anthony
Hordern’s Underhill South-
down stud.
Round Hill is an example of
what a husband-and-wife team
can do, given courage and
imagination. Anthony Hor-
dern, third generation of his
family to serve on the R.A.S.
Council, has followed his
father as chairman of the
cattie-section committee. He
bought Round Hill when it
was run-down and has since
turned it into one of the best-
designed cattle-stations in Aus-
tralia —possibly in the world.
When he bought the
property, the land—it varies
from flat to undulating—was
suffering from a serious defici-
ency of humus. The soil is
naturally rich and about 40ft.
deep, and rainfall is around
27in. Hordern’s programme of
ploughing and ripping, with
topdressings of super, and
molybdenum, brought results.
He ripped the soil to a depth
of 2ft., using a chisel-plough
and incorporating large quanti-
ties of organic matter in the
topsoil. This prevented wind-
erosion which has troubled
neighboring properties. The
next step was pasture-improve-
ment; in 1956 he had gained
second place in the Southern
Inland zone in the R.A.S. pas-
ture-and-fodder competition
and three years later came
second in the Culcairn district.

pasture is made into silage and
hay. There are now 36 silage-
pits around the property, hold-
ing more than 12,000 tons. It
was here we learned from
manager Ken Fredericks the
first lesson of the tour: “What
with silage and irrigation, after
our lush spring we should have
enough fodder to last us for
years.”
The layout of paddocks, the
white fences and stockyards,
the machinery-sheds and farm-
buildings are all Anthony
Hordern’s own design and
make the property a model of
its kind. (Even the weather-
cocks are individual, I noticed,
and show beef-cattle, perhaps,
or a tractor, depending on
where each is placed).
In his Round Hill Beef Short-
horn stud Anthony Hordern
has followed the tradition of
his father’s famous Milton
Park Beef Shorthorn stud at
Bowral. Characteristics are
good, flat bone, and quality in
milking-capacity, hair, legs and
muzzle. First sires were the
white Woomargama Quixotic
by Coonong Napoleon, Won-
gala Guardsman by Cruggle-
ton Pandarus (imp.), Coonong
Adonis by Coonong Viking,
and Keirstone Kilolink by
Chapelton Pilot (imp.).
Present top sire is Erimus
Intrepid (imp.), supreme cham-
pion Shorthorn at the 1955
Royal Show of England. The
landed cost of this bull in Aus-
tralia was £13,700 —a record
for any bull imported by one
owner. Foundation-females
for the stud came from leading
Australian studs, with importa-
tions from England and Scot-
land. Sires now in use are
Erimus Intrepid, Erimus Kim
(imp.), Round Hill Chieftain
and Round Hill Clansman,

Pony Club
After tea at Glen Elgin, we
moved to Wagga Wagga, stop-
ping first at the showground,
where the Wagga and District
Pony Club gave a display of
horsemanship for our benefit.
We were welcomed by A.
Osborne (president), N. Drum-
mond (vice-president), Jack
Connors, T. Holland (chief-
instructor) and D. Dawson
(hon. treasurer). There were a
number of the 150 members of
the club present, and besides
the ordinary club-activities we
watched a flag-race and a
bending-race. The Sydney
Show entrants —not a team,
but individual competitors:
Jim Mclntyre (12), Sue Car-
radus (15), Marie Carradus
(14) and lan Dawson (14)
gave a demonstration of their
prowess. Dr. C. C. Sands,
president of the Canberra Pony
Club, was also paying a visit
that afternoon.
Wagga Wagga
Leaving the showground
when the display was finished,
we drove into the city of Wagga
W a g g a* 1 —“meeting-place of
many crows” and home of the
Tichborne claimant—the capi-
tal of the rich pastoral and
agricultural district of the
Riverina. We were accorded
a civic welcome in the Council
Chambers by' the May o r,
Alderman I. J. Jack, and mem-
bers of his council.
Wagga, proclaimed a city in
1946, has an area of 21,509
acres and a population of more
than 21,000. More than
250,000 people live within a
radius of 100 miles of the
city. The Murrumbidgee flows
through the city, and Wagga
beach, floodlit during summer,
is famous in the neighborhood.
The Wagga Show, a three-day
event conducted by the Mur-
jumbidgee P. and A. Associa-
tion, is one of the biggest in

Berkshire Pigs
After an overnight stop at
Wagga, we moved on next
morning to Miss Helen Mc-
Nickle’s Yarrabin Berkshire
stud. Founded in 1951, this
stud has won its young owner
two or three flourbagsful of
show-ribbons.
Miss McNickle, who con-
ducts it entirely singlehanded,
is at present running 24 pigs
in her stud. She first exhibited
at Sydney in 1954 and had her
first success the following year,
when Hillsia Wedding Day 31st
was champion in the sow-
progeny group.
At the 1956 Royal Easter
Show, Hillsia O’Day took first
prize for a boar over 17
months and not over four
Miss McNickle has also
shown her pigs at the Mel-
feourne Royal (Hillsia Gass, 15
months, was champion Berk-
shire boar in 1959), at Wagga
(Hillsia Olympic Boy was
champion Berkshire boar in
1959) and at Tumut. At the
Royal Easter this year she'll
be showing nine sows and one
boar.
Miss McNickle and her
mother run the property (700
acres) with help from her four
brothers. Besides the Berk-
shire stud, which is Miss Mc-
Nickle’s personal venture, they
have 800 Corriedale fat lambs
and about 200 chickens. Orig-
inally there was a dairy stud,
too, but they let it go some
time ago. About 400 acres of
the property are improved pas-
ture, from which hay is baled,
Miss McNickle uses home-
grown wheat and oats to feed
her pigs and adds buttermilk-
powder to improve their con-
dition before the Show. She
sells only for stud purposes, and
has exported pigs to the Depart-
ment of Agriculture in North
Borneo and sold inter-State to
Tasmania and Western Aus-
tralia.
Wagga Agricultural College
We went on to the Wagga
Agricultural College and Ex-
periment Station, which was
founded in 1949 on a site used
as an experimental farm since
1893. W. J. Farrer carried out
some of his wheat-breeding
operations here.
Today the college has ac-
commodation for 94 resident-
students, but the principal, B.

buildings are extended the
college is obliged to turn away
a considerable number of
applicants. Students’ average
age is 17, and they are not
allowed to specialise. The
college farm, approximately
3217 acres, is divided into
various sections: sheep, beef-
cattle, dairying, piggery, Arab-
horse stud, horticulture, plant-
breeding and agrostology, poul-
try and apiary. Lessons in
woolclassing and manual skills
are also available to all
students, and there’s a rifle-club
and the usual cultural activi-
ties to occupy their spare time.
We saw the six Poll Short-
horn bulls and the Poll Short-
horn steer which are going to
the Sydney Show, then moved
to the Arab-horse stud —they’re
exhibiting four Arab horses —
and admired Razaz, the im-
ported stallion which was
champion at the 1956 and 1957
Royal Easter Shows. After
lunch with the students we
visited the Bronzewing turkey
stud, and some members of the
party went to look over the
nine head of Jersey cattle the
college is also sending to the
Show.
Brewarrana Field-day
Next stop was W. J. Lene-
han’s property, Brewarrana,
Narrandera. These 12,001
acres of rich Murrumbidgee
country are the home of one
of the finest Poll Hereford
studs in the Commonwealth,
and there are also 18,000 sheep
on the station.
The Poll Hereford stud was
formed by W. J. Lenehan in
1948, with six females and a
bull —Milton Trader 2nd, by
Hazford Rollo 2nd (P. imp.,
U.S.A.) from Milton Electra
2nd —all from Milton Park. A
year later Lenehan bought an-
other six Milton Park females,
including the great breeding-
cow Milton Lady Myuna 2nd
and Milton Lady Demon 2nd
in calf to Trudmore Domino
16th (P. imp., U.S.A.). Lady
Demon produced Brewarrana
Domino (P.), one of the greatest
Poll Hereford sires in Australia.
Brewarrana Domino’s progeny
has so far grossed about
£lOO,OOO.
Brewarrana Domino first
came to the fore at the 1954
Sydney Royal, where its male
progeny won first and second
places under 12 months, junior
and reserve championships and
first pair of bulls. Its female
progeny won first place under
21 months, third under 18
months, second and fourth
under 12 months.
Lenehan, not surprisingly,
was adjudged that year’s most
successful exhibitor. At the
1957 Royal Easter Show Bre-
warrana won the three cham-
pionships—a feat performed
only once before (by Anthony
Hordern in 1947). One of
Domino’s sons, Brewarrana
Gallant 3rd, was champion of
the 1957 Melbourne Royal and
1958 Sydney Royal.
rana Poll Herefords have been
sent to all States in the Com-
monwealth and have won
championships at the Perth and
Adelaide Royal Shows.
Each year, a few weeks be-
fore the Royal Easter Show,
Lenehan stages a field-day at
Brewarrana, so that people may
come to view the cattle he is
going to send to Sydney and
inspect his private irrigation-
plant. This year the field-day
was arranged to coincide with
the journalists’ tour, so we
arrived in the middle of it.
There were 900 visitors there
from Narrandera and other
districts. Judging-competitions
had been organised for the boys
of the Yanco Agricultural High
School, and St. Francis’ College,
Leeton, and for boys and girls
of the local Junior Farmers.
The competition was adjudi-
cated by Keith Hawkins, of
Springfield, Finley (N.S.W.),
and won by P. Wallace, of St.
Francis’ College, and Colleen
Dillon, of the Narrandera
Junior Farmers (aged 10, this
young lady knows a lot about
cattle-judging, but wants to be
a nurse).
Ron Reynolds, of Sheppar-
ton (Vic.), won the prize for
best leader. George Forbes,

competitions.
Brewarrana entries for this
year’s Royal Easter Show are
six bulls (Brewarrana Dia-
mond, Mascot, Rambler, Am-
pol, Ormonde 2nd and Ensign
4th), two heifers (Brewarrana
Jewel 2nd and Laura sth) and
a steer. The show-team was
lined-up to give us the best
picture of even breeding and
excellent conformation that it
would be possible to imagine.
We left the field-day after
the judging-competitions had
finished and went to inspect
Lenehan’s ambitious private
irrigation-scheme. The main
feature of this is the 125-h.p.
electric motor which can pump
half-a-million gallons from the
Murrumbidgee in an hour.
Engaged in a programme of
pasture-improvement, Lenehan
has at present 1000 acres of
contoured improved pastures,
with phalaris, Wimmera-rye-
grass and red-clover, and 200
acres of white-clover.
“Australia’s Food-basket”
Leaving Brewarrana we en-
tered the Murrumbidgee Irri-
gation Area, that magnificent
project which grew from Sir
Samuel McCaughey’s origina/
imagination in irrigating his
property at Yanko and, to a
lesser extent, Gogeldrie Station.
Arthur Deakin’s 1885 mission
to the United States resulted
in the arrival of George
Chaffey, an American irriga-
tion-engineer, whose scheme
led to some thousands of
acres of land, once reported as
useless, being brought under
irrigation and turned into one
of the richest areas in the
Commonwealth. Eventually, in
July, 1912, after the construc-
tion of the Burrinjuck storage-
dam, the Berembed diversion-
weir and the main canals, the
M.I.A. was opened. It then
had an area of about 20,000
acres, but its population was
less than 500. Now, 48 years
later, the population is nearly
30,000 on a total area of
451,251 acres (191,619 irri-
gated) with 2037 farm-holdings.
Principal products of the
M.I.A. are fruit, vegetables,
rice, wheat, oats, wool, fat
lambs and beef-cattle. It is
estimated that the total value
of primary-production in the
M.I.A. during its 48 years of
existence exceeds £ 100-million.
We spent the night of March
15-16 in Leeton, which is one
of the two main towns of the
M. , and shares with Griffith
the distinction of being among
the finest in the State. The
town of Leeton was laid-out by
Walter Burley Griffin, who
designed Canberra, and it is
now the headquarters of the
N. Rice Marketing Board
and of the Murrumbidgee
County Council. Here also is
the largest fruit and vegetable
cannery in Australia.
Leeton Co-operative
Cannery
We started the next day by
visiting this cannery, where we
received a civic welcome from
O. J. Washington, president of
Leeton Shire Council, who was
supported by Brian Maguire,
Show-president and deputy
shire-president R. Griffith
(chairman of directors of the
cannery), manager Bert Lowe
and secretary Lloyd Williams,
Also present was R. H. Mc-
Ghee, district-engineer of the
M.I.A. In the course of the
morning we learned the second
lesson of this tour: the value
of co-operation. The factory
itself—it works 52 weeks of the
year, and is able to handle an
annual total of about 20,000
tons of fresh fruit and vege-
tables worth more than
£36o,ooo—has made the label
“Letona” famous throughout
Australia and the world; and it

is a purely co-operative enter-
prise. The same is true of the
gardens and bowling-greens in
the centre of the town. When
they needed these amenities the
citizens took their picks and
shovels and went out together
to build them.
Practically every fruit- and
vegetable-grower in the Leeton
and Yenda districts is an inter-
ested shareholder in the can-
nery —it was founded in 1935 —
and the majority of the helpers
within the establishment are
local residents, although each
fruit-season a few months’ em-
ployment is given to about
400 extra workers from all
parts of N.S.W. Production-
figures are high and the can-
nery is able to produce 530,000
cans of high-quality foodstuffs
on a busy working-day.
Letona brings-out a full
range of canned fruits, jams,
and canned vegetables, includ-
ing fresh garden green-peas,
cauliflower, sweetcorn, tomato-
juice and soup. More than
1200 workers are employed on
the plant, and the buildings
owned by the company cover
18 acres.
During our inspection of the
cannery we saw peaches being
processed and learned a great
deal about what happens to the
fruit when it leaves the grower's
orchard. We saw every part
of the process, from the time
the peaches arrive and are
halved, graded and peeled
until they are put in cans,
steam-closed and finally packed
in cardboard cartons.
Leaving the cannery we
visited the orchard of Maurie
and Hector Grant, about three
miles from the centre of
Leeton. Here, on 50 acres, the
Grants grow peaches, oranges
and apricots, which they sell to
the cannery and to the Sydney
markets. From the Grants’
orchard we moved to J. G. Jen-
kins’s citrus-orchard at Stan-
bridge and inspected the three
anti-frost wind-machines he
has installed to protect his
fruit. He has 26 acres of
orchard, and each of these
machine s—they cost £650
apiece covers approximately
2\ acres.
McWilliam’s Winery,
Hanwood
Our luncheon-date that day
was at the Hanwood vineyard
of McWilliam’s Wines Pty.,
Ltd., where we were accorded a
civic welcome by C. L. Neville,
president of Wade Shire. G.
McWilliam and his wife did
the honors and we were enter-
tained with a sumptuous buffet-
lunch laid-out in the cellars
and supplemented by Mc-
William’s prizewinning wines—
Richard Hermitage was pos-
sibly the most notable.
The McWilliam family
started grape-growing and
wine-making around Corowa
(N.S.W.) in 1877, and in 1900
J. J. McWilliam branched-out
to Junee, where he established
vineyards and a winery. Soon
after this the irrigation scheme
started in the Riverina, and in
1912 the main canal reached
Hanwood, five miles from
Griffith. Next year McWilliam
took-up two farm-blocks there,
each of 50 acres, and planted
35,000 grape-cuttings, the first
in the area. In 1916 the first
crop was taken to the Junee
winery for processing. At the
same time he started building
the Hanwood winery, which
for some time was the largest
single winery operating in Aus-
tralia. Since then the House
of McWilliam has expanded its
interests, and, with its vine-
yards and wineries at Yenda
and Beelbangera, now handles
the greater part of the area’s
grape-harvest. These wineries,
with their famous Mount
Pleasant vineyards in the Hun-
ter River Valley, make Mc-
William’s the largest wine-pro-
ducers in N.S.W.
After lunch we walked round
the vineyard and winery. Then
we embussed again and made

our way into the town of
Griffith.
Griffith
A little more than 40 years
ago Griffith was a tent-town.
The area which now comprises
Wade Shire then had a popu-
lation of a few hundred and
an annual production of about
£60,000. Now the population
is nearly 16,000 and the annual
production exceeds £6-million
The town was named after
Arthur Griffith, Minister for
Public Works, 1910-13, and
like Leeton was designed by
Burley Griffin. The popula-

tion of the town itself was 8000
in 1959. It has an increasing
number of industries, particu-
larly manufacturing and food-
processing plants canneries,
pulping- and freezing-works
and rice-mills.
Rice-growing
Our first visit next morning
was to Rod Smith’s Farm 1697,
where, from his total 600 acres
—he runs cattle and has 2000
sheep—-50 acres are under rice.
We went to inspect his rice-
crop.
Rice is the biggest earner in
*be M.1.A., and the 1959 crop
was w °dh nearly

tries. Foundations of the in-
dustry were laid by John Brady,
manager of the Leeton Can-
nery, just after War I. On a
visit to California in 1920
Brady noticed that a prosper-
ous rice-industry was growing
there on heavy soils similar to
the less-favorable soils of the
M.I.A. So he brought back
seed of two Italian varieties
and a Japanese rice. From
these, after test, the N.S.W.
Department of Agriculture
selected the stubby Caloro
grain which has become the
basis of the Australian indus-
try. In the past 25 years rice
has spread from almost an un-
known crop to cover about
30,000 acres in the Riverina.
The Rice Marketing Board for
the State of N.S.W. intends to
illustrate this by presenting a
striking exhibit at the 1960
Royal Easter Show.
Taking us to see his crop,
Rod Smith explained how the
annual allocation of acreage is

worked-out by the Water Con-
servation and Irrigation Com-
mission on the recommenda-
tion of the Rice Producers’ Co-
operative. He’s been growing
rice for some time and finds
it best to follow a seven-year
rotation, burning his stubble
after harvest, rather than
ploughing it in. He showed us
a John Deere autoheader with
a 14ft. cut, which he uses for
rice or wheat. He reckons on
getting about 3 tons an acre,
he said. This year's harvest will
start in about a month’s time.
There we also met Roelof
Schoonbeck, who is a steward
at the Jondaryan Club (where
we were made honorary mem-
bers for the duration of our
stay) and who also helps on the
land. Schoonbeck told me that
when he arrived in Australia
from Holland in 1951 he
asked a porter at Sydney's
Central Station where Griffith
was and the porter replied that
he had never heard of the
place!
Producers’ Co-operative
We went back to Griffith and
toured the establishments of
the “Producers” under the
leadership of general-manager
T. J. Morley.
The Griffith Producers Co-
operative Co., Ltd., had its
origin just after War I, when a
small group of soldier-settlers,
“Catching the judge's eye, she calls it—but I call it COMMON!”
struggling for every penny they
made, formed a co-operative
to help them to purchase their
requirements at wholesale
rates. The company now has
a membership of 709, with
funds of £211,500 invested in
its assets.
Its purpose is to provide
shareholders with materials
needed to grow and harvest
their crops, and then to provide
marketing-outlets for the crops
harvested. Profits are diverted
among those who have invested
funds and among shareholders
who have used the company's
facilities during each year of
operation. By means of re-
bates and dividends members
have doubled their money in
eight years.
We first watched a demon-
stration of dehydration and
processing of prunes and then
visited the fresh-fruit packing'
house, watching Packham pears
being got ready for Sydney
Market, Valencia oranges be-
ing dispatched to juice-fac-
tories and to railway refresh-
ment-rooms —“direct from the
M.I.A.” —and Granny Smith
apples being packed for ex-
port to the UK. The Pro-
ducers’ well-known trade-name
“Excello” is used only on the
home-market, so the export-
shipment bore the exporting-
agent’s label.
After leaving the Producers,
we paid a visit to Griffith Co-
operative Rice-mill, and then
were entertained to lunch by
the Shell Co. —their local agent,
A. PfafFlin, arranged it—at the
Yoogali Club, where the mem-
bership is 75 per cent. Italian.
Yanco Experiment Farm
Last visit of the tour was to
the Yanco Experiment Farm,
where we were greeted by
farm-manager R. J. Flynn.
Established by the N.S.W.
Department of Agriculture in
1907, the farm covers 2045
acres, with a wide range of
soils and topography. About
450 acres are under gravity-
irrigation, 450 acres are laid-

Australia’s genius is wool..
You can see it in the gentle way of the sheep breeder as he prides a majestic Merino for
a coveted show ribbon; you can see it in the sensitive hands of the classer, who at a
finger's touch, will tell you the past and the future of the grower’s clip. You will see it
in the dedication of the Australian scientist who made it possible for fine, soft wools
to perform with the mundane practicality of lesser fibres. Above all you will see it in the
design of Australian fashions; for here the genius of wool becomes truly a way of living.
Only in wool can Australians find the sophistication of texture, the “feel”, the warmth
to express their easy, relaxed way of life. For clothes that live with you . . . .

ture and provides short courses
of instruction for field-
officers and junior farmers.
On the livestock side, sheep-
trials are conducted on man-

dairy-stud which has been very
successful at local and Royal

be Wollongbar Flares Vera,
placed last year in the four-

Easter Show'. This year's Show
team will consist of four bulls
and nine cows.
Leaving the dairy-stud we
paid a visit to the experimental
plots of tobacco and cotton and
finally called at the manager's
office.

This ended the 1960 Royal
Easter Show preview. We left
Clive Fearne’s coach at Nar-

in a Viewmaster aircraft,

sation to bring us back to
Sydney.
These tours are of inestim-
able value to press, radio and
TV, and, if faithfully reported,
cannot fail to bring home to
the general public—particularly
those who, for example, “think
that when they get to Parra-
matta they are entering the
outback"—the basic fact that
Australia is first and last a
primary-producing country.
It’s easy to forget or ignore
that fact, but we shall do so
at our peril.

A STORY OF HARVEST-TIME
"’Hay Ain’t Light”
By ERIC BEDFORD
For twenty-five years I had
said: “When harvest-
time comes I’ll go into
the wheatlands. I’ll work
with my hands. I’ll get into
physical nick. I’ll dissolve
this belly.”
And, eventually, I did.
In Narrabri I asked a farmer
where I could find harvest
work. He looked at my soft-
ness, and then a gleam of hope
came into his eye. “Would you
help me get my hay in? I
can’t get anybody to help me.
They all want three-quid a day.
I can only afford thirty-five
bob.” So thirty-five bob it
was.
We drove about twenty miles
to the property, but before we
got there we went down to the
Namoi River, and my master
said (in a deceiving voice):
“We’ll put a bit of gravel on,
on the way out.”
A few tons of gravel on the
end of a shovel thrown from
the low river-banks to the high
truck became a sort of physical
eye-opener which made me
blink as the “bar-work” of city
life trickled into my eyes and
made rivulets down my legs. I
suggested to the young farmer
that we should move his
property to the river. It would
be easier.
He said I must be “soft.”
With the Namoi-bank shifted
onto the truck, we had a swim.
Paradise to a gravel-torn soul!
Tll7'e drove on through millions
** of grasshoppers to the
homestead. The ’hoppers deco-
rated anything they hit with a
greeny-grey ooze. The crows
hung heavily and cawless in the
branches, their caws choked by
a surfeit of grasshoppers. The
’hoppers ate everything except
the roly-poly.
The farm raised fat lambs,
and the hay was for feeding
the horses and the dairy-cows
in times of drought. The family
comprised Jack (the master),
his wife (“good for a city girl,”
according to Jack), and twenty-
months of boy of a pleasant,
investigating nature.
The master consulted me
about the rules of “the game.”
How would I like it? On the
basis that the master had not
been able to get anyone to help
him, and that I was as soft as
a doting mother to a wilful
child, I suggested that to rise
early, throw hay until the sun
grew hot, then relax for a few
hours, and go back to throw
hay in the cool of the evening,
was to my liking. We com-
promised on working until mid-
day, resting for two hours, and
then working until dark or
until I gave out, or in, or
dissolved into the dusty soil.
Next morning we drove to
the hayshed. I looked out on
the enemy, which stood in
orderly ranks, melting into the
heat-haze of the distance. The
hay was all prettily arranged
in a paddock which rocked
with a furnace-like hazy heat.
The master said, “There are
only twenty acres.”
I had to believe him. I saw
him eyeing me and then the
paddock of hay as though
estimating which side would
win. Hay-forks were thrown
on the truck, and we drove
across the stripped paddock to
the far end.
Now, as I was the novice, I
couldn’t pack the load. All I
had to do was to drive the
truck to some stooks, pull-up
truck, get out of truck, pitch
hay!
First one stook near the
truck, second stook slightly
further, third stook a long way
off.
A twenty-foot throw this
time. Get into truck, drive to
new stooks, get out of truck,
throw more sheaves.
Simple? Yes. Rythmical?
Yes. Arduous? Not at first.
But, when you have thrown
some thousand sheaves, hay
ain’t light. I could feel my
belly slipping, and the sun bit
into me like a hot grid, my
whole body ached, the blisters

came from the fork, the hay-
itch came, I tied handkerchiefs
around my hands to make
something less pulpy to hold
the fork. And I got in and out
of that wagon, and snakes
came out of the stooks, nice
big long ones, six - footers,
browns and tigers, and they
were sent to the snake Heaven
with the fork.
And then you watched the
next few stooks for snakes and
only mice came out, and then
you expected a mouse and out
came a snake. 1 thought of
snakes-and-ladders we used to
play as boys.
Ah! The load’s on! Now,
gently across the furrows to the
hayshed. Take off hay. As I
was the novice I “could not
stack the hay,” so I had to
throw the hay up. You don’t
buy a pig and grunt for him.
Two loads by ten-o’clock.
Have a smoke-oh. I sink down
in the hayshed. A voice from
another planet, the top of the
stack: “Whilst you’re having a
blow, shift that bit of iron, will
you, mate?”
A bit of iron! It’s the Queen
Mary all broken-up and wait-
ing for me to shift it. Well, I’m
trying to get hard. I shift the
Queen Mary out of the hay-
shed.
Six hay-loads that day, and
each load about a thousand
sheaves. Each load a thousand
throws onto the wagon and
.a thousand throws off. Twelve-
thousand throws I made that
day. Hay ain’t light. I esti-
mated that I drank 20 gallons
of water during the day and
sweated out 24 gallons, the
excess being the residue of soft
living over years.
T believe I had a shower that
-*• night, and' nibbled at food,
and patched my ha ! y-torn
hands, and looked from my
bed to a tree laden with mul-i
berries 20 yards away and
thought how fine they would
be in the mouth, and then my;
wracked body was taken to a
haymakers’ hell. I got in and
out of that truck all night, and
threw sheaves and killed snakes.
It went on for three days*
and nights. And then the
master said he’d drive me back
to Narrabri.
As I eased myself into the
truck he looked at the load of
gravel we had brought from
the river. “I wonder if I’ll
need another load of gravel for
the floor of that shed?” he
asked.
I had only to look at him
with a half-insane smile. “Oh,
well, I’ll get it on the way back
from town,” he said. 1 nodded
approval. Incidentally, when
he paid me the stupendous sum
of £5 ss. for the three days’
work he told me we had
created a two-man record for
hay- and stack-making. Luckily,
he hadn't ruined my thirst.
After a day spent between
the bed and the bathroom with
its Narrabri borewater, 1 deter-
mined never to look at a hay-
fork again. I looked at the
map. Coonabarabran! Eupho-
nious name. 1 will go there.
No trains to Coonabarabran
for a couple of days. I thumb
a ride to Gunnedah. The mail-
man’s just gone. I thumb a
ride to Coonabarabran. Work?
Not harvesting yet. All right

Have you ever built hard-
wood trestles 15ft. high?
Well, you measure lengths and
bore holes and put bolts
through, and the timber has
pieces of steel hidden inside it
so the old bit won’t bite, and
a different kind of blisters
comes in places different from
those caused by haymaking.
And, as your head bends,
the sun runs around and
down and gets about two
inches behind your ear and
starts boring a hole through the
nape of your neck.
Now you have constructed
four sides, 15ft. high. You
juggle them into place, climb
on to the crazy structure, bore
holes and put bolts through.
And the abos. stand around
and grin a little, trusting they
will be entertained by the sight
of a sweating white man who
has built a structure to collapse
from and break, his silly neck.
But fate is kind to the white
man until he hears the cry:
“The iron’s come!” Why there
should be such enthusiasm
about the arrival of ten tons
of galvanised-iron is beyond
everyone but the abos., who see
more fun watching the white
man’s struggle, and so take up
easy positions in the shade,
grinning, and poking thumbs
towards the “carpenter,” and
falling into postures of rib-
aching laughter at their own
comments.
The new “master” says that
the iron-handling needs two
men. Vince, a wiry aboriginal,
and myself.
Well, galvanised-iron is quite
easy. You merely take more
sheets than you can carry, and
stagger with it on to the lorry
from the railway-truck, and the
iron sheets cut your fingers,
and the blood stains the iron,
and the abos. dig each other in
the ribs and laugh heartily.
But there is still more joy!
“The sleepers have arrived!”
For two days you slide sleepers
into the holes and enough
splinters to start a fire go into
your chest and hands.
And while you hold the
sleeper a madman with a
sledgehammer beats the sleeper
and yourself into position.
You cough like an asthmatic
cow, and look at the long line
of sleepers waiting with their
splinters for your chest.
Why will everything be in
thousands? Who called them
sleepers? They are the most
alive, bitingest things ever
hewn from a tree! Apart from
all the little sleepers sticking
out of the big sleepers there
are those contrary sleepers
which suffer from insomnia
and jump at your shinbones
with an approving laugh from
the watching abos. Sleepers,
my eye! And if you look
menacingly at the abos. they
go into tribal talk of taboos
with the blank faces of river-
gums.
And then the rain came. All
the farmers thought of
their wheat and bit their lower
lips. I thought of a rest from
the sleepers, and curled my top
lip.
I remember that in Tam-
worth I saw a middle-aged
farmer standing in a corner of
a bar with his hat drawn
almost over his eyes to shut out
the sight of the hail and the
rain.
“Yes,” he said to his aqui-
line-nosed friend. “I’ve just
about had it. I had lousy
seasons for years. Whenever
it looked good I did the wrong
planting. And now this year
I get a crop of wheat which
looks like fixing the world’s
bread-shortage. It’s got ears
six inches long and grain on it
as big as a pawnbroker’s sign.
I look like raising the mortgage,
an’ the kids’ll have boots fer
years, an’ the Missus’ll have
some of them Pylong stockings,
an’ I’ll be able to look the bull
in the face again; an’ then this
comes along.”
The great storm broke. Hail
and rain filled Tamworth
gutters. The kids played in
the gutters, caring not, because
they knew not, of the damage
done to those beautiful wheat-
fields. In came the usual fool
to make the usual foolish
occasion. “It’s great rain!
Have a drink, old boy?” he
asked the farmer.
The farmer turned to his
friend.
“It’s a fact,” he said with a
wry smile and a gesture to the
fool, “when your luck’s out a
mosquito can kick you to

USING AUSTRALIA'S SURPLUS
[From “J.C.T.”]
Fear of overproduction seems
to haunt the Australian farmer.
In my own neighborhood —
the Murrumbidgee Irrigation
Area—l have often known
canners decline to take the
whole of a crop of fruit or
vegetables because they have
A constant anxiety to
woolgrowers must
surely be lambing
losses, particularly when
facts show that the
majority of lambs lost
die either at birth or
during the 72 hours
immediately following.
In Australia, animal
physiologists are giving
more attention to these
problems, and consider-
able progress has been
gained.
Lamb losses occasioned
by set-back, fly-strike
and other diseases must
also be a constant
worry, but the use of
Elastrator for castrat-
ing and tailing greatly
reduces this worry.
Because Elastrator

been afraid they would not be
able to sell at a profit. Often,
a few months later, they were
regretting that they did not can
to the limit, noting then that
there was a ready market. But
in the meantime producers had
lost part of their year’s work,
or had taken a low price, or
got rid of their crop in some
other direction.
I quote the action of canners
because the canning industry
comes first to my mind, but the
same circumstances arise in
many other lines of production.
It seems paradoxical, for
instance, that, after the diver-
sion of the Snowy River has
increased the area suitable for
high production, farmers hesi-
tate to take the land up because
of this same dread of over-
production.
One of the best times farmers
ever knew was immediately
after War 11, when everything
they could grow found a ready
market, due to world-shortages
and the Marshall Plan. What-
ever had happened there would
have been a shortage of food
throughout the world, but with-
out the imagination and organi-
sation of the Marshall Plan
many in need of food would
never have got it. And perhaps
half Europe —as well as much
more of the world —would have
turned Communist but for the
foresight of General Marshall
and his collaborators.
If the Western nations in-
tend to beat Communism they
could hardly find a better way
of doing so than by maintain-
ing this supply of food to the
underfed peoples of the world,
whatever their race or color
may be.
The account U.S. Senator
Humphries gave of his inter-
view with Mr. Khrushchev is
worth thinking about. Khrush-
chev pointed out to the Senator
that the Soviet could embarrass
the capitalist countries by
flooding certain markets with
cheap manufactured goods, but
he admitted that they could not
compete with us in supplying
foodstuffs, because at present
they have barely enough for
themselves.
I think we need a Marshall
Plan now for the underfed
peoples of the world, just as
much as we needed it after the
war.
As far as Australia is con-
cerned, such a scheme would
not prevent us supplying the
markets we already have. On
the contrary, it would help
these established markets, be-
cause we could maintain con-
tinuity of supplies and so re-
move the bogy of overproduc-
tion.
Of course, such a scheme
would have to accept central
direction about the amounts
and varieties of food needed.
But luxury-items would quickly
find their own price-level, and
the general boost to our
economy would be very great.
I have put the selfish angle
first, but there is another im-
portant aspect for considera-
tion. We should look pretty
callous to the rest of the world
if we restricted our own food-
production while millions else-
where were starving.
In my opinion we should get
better value for our money by
producing to the limit and
making sure that the food we
produced reached the under-/
fed peoples of the world than
we ever could by maintaining!

Pink-eye in Sheep
“Belar”: Pink-eye can be
spread very quickly through a
flock by long grass or by bush-l
flies which convey the infec-
tion from sheep to sheep.
Infection starts from animals
which, though previously;
affected and cured, still harbor
the germ. Once a sheep has
been affected it will be im-
mune for from three months
to a year. Those that retain
immunity for longer ares
“carriers,” though there’s no |
way of identifying them.
Treatment must be started
in the early stages. Directly a
watery discharge is noticed
from the eyes of any of the
sheep infected animals must be
put into immediate isolation.
Before the discovery of anti-
biotics a solution of 2oz. zinc-
sulphate in lpt. water, applied
four times daily, effectively
controlled the disease. An eye-
dressing of chlorymyciten 1
per cent, also gives excellent
results, and one application will
often cure mild infections
caught in the early stages.

The man on the land
knows from experience:
there is no satisfactory
substitute for STEEL PIPE
After experimentation with other types of piping,
experienced land men invariably come to one
conclusion there’s no really satisfactory sub-
stitute for Steel Pipe.
Steel Pipe, for instance, is not susceptible to
damage by stock, fire, rodents or termites and
can, therefore, be laid above ground saving
trenching costs.
In addition it has greater strength, longer life,
and can stand greater pressures. Steel Pipe is
easy to handle or store without fear of breakage,
and is adaptable to innumerable uses.
Why take risks with other fragile, easily damaged,
shorter-lived types of piping!

Tariff Commission has just
begun into U.S. imports of
carcass mutton and lamb, and
of live sheep.
The Australian Meat Board
has sent what is described as
“a strong delegation” to sub-
mit to the commission a case
against any restrictions on
mutton and lamb imports,
either by way of quotas or
increased tariffs.
Primary Industry Minister
Adermann points out that the
issues and the principles
involved are of considerable
importance to the Australian
meat-export industry. He’s
right, of course, but U.S.
politics is not always con-
cerned about principles as
applied to other countries—as
Trade Minister McEwen knows
full well.
Last year Australia built-up
a useful trade with the U.S.
in mutton, lamb and live sheep,
especially in boneless mutton
(used by U.S. processors, and
not regarded—in Australia, at
least —as competing with the
class of mutton produced by
the numerically small but
vocally active American sheep-
raisers). Value of the mutton
and lamb exports last year
was about $8,000,000.

the yard the best guide is that
in light breeds males have
bigger and deeper-colored
combs.
Heavy breeds are more diffi-
cult to differentiate, and it's
often necessary to watch
feather-growth. A female
chick is always better feathered
for its age than the male. It’s
important to remember—since
it’s sometimes taken the other
way round —that females will
grow their tails and develop
feathers on the back, chest and
wings much quicker than males.
Another pointer—the leg of
a heavy-breed cockerel is
stouter and longer than the
female’s. At a month, the
cockerel’s body is cobbed and
its stance more erect.
Queensland's
Grain Prospects
“Myall”: Excluding fodder-
crops, Queensland has over
418,000' acres sown for the
1960 harvest. All acreages, ex-
cept panicum and white
French-millet, are in excess of
last year’s sowings.
Grain-sorghum. No w the
most important summer grain-
crop, because its cultivation
needs no special machinery,
this is always in demand. Its
leaves and stalks remain green
after the grain has been har-
vested, making good fodder
for stock. The area of 170,000
acres sown is an increase of
20,000 acres on last year’s
plantings, which yielded
3,750,000 bushels. Good rains
in most districts have im-
proved growing-conditions and
satisfactory yields are expected.
Maize. Although not as
popular as sorghum, maize is
largely grown around Kinga-
roy, in the Burdekin Valley
and on the Atherton Table-
land. y Sowings total 117,000
acres (3000 more than last
season's, from which three-
million bushels were harvested).
Growing-conditions have been
good, and prospects are the
best for several years.

tion in acreage is mainly duel
to low prices last season.
Soy-beans. About 2000

Cotton.' Plantings in Cen-
tral and South Queensland are
estimated at 56,000 acres. Sow-
ing in the Burdekin Valley
(N.Q.) had not* been completed
at time of writing. The crop in
South and Central districts is
expected to exceed 15,000 bales
of raw cotton-lint (the 1959
crop produced 7500 bales from
18,000 acres).
Summer fodder-crops have
grown well in most districts,
although wet conditions ham-
pered preparation of the land
and delayed sowing in a few
areas and too much moisture
caused some yellowing. No
great reduction of yields is ex-
pected. Lucerne production
has been high everywhere,
though rain hampered hay-
making. Native pasture-species
have grown vigorously, often
showing a tendency to become
rank. Improved-pastures, par-
ticularly Rhodes and green-
panic, have made wonderful
growth, and irrigated pas-
tures have produced heavy
crops of feed.
Due to dry con itions in the

previous season. About 13-
million bushels of wheat were
produced from 700,000 acres
(16,100,000 from 704,000 acres
in 1958). Barley acreages
totalled 250,000 in 1959, yield-
ing six-million bushels (in
1958 about 8,100,000 bushels
were harvested from little more
than the same area).
Sowings of oats in 1959 —
32,000 acres with a yield of
650,000 bushels —w a s 7000
acres less than in 1958, when
832,000 bushels were har-
vested.
Linseed crops were heavily
attacked by heliothus-cater-
pillar, and yields were some-
what light (the 75,000 acres pro-
duced about 650,000 bushels).
Sowings of canary-seed in
1959 were less than in 1958,
and the average yield was down
considerably, due to adverse
weather. Return in 1959 from
the 8000 acres sown was 70,000
bushels (in 1958 9000 acres
produced 89,300 bushels).
Altogether, the yield of
summer-crops should be high,
and quality excellent.
Wheat-mclasses
“Jaygee”: At Melbourne
University’s animal-research
centre scientists are trying to
find better methods of feeding
stock during long dry periods.
The work is being financed
by the Victorian Wool Re-
search Committee, and experi-
ments with urea and molasses
have shown encouraging re-
sults over the last three years.
t—— —.
Dry, unpalatable fodder of
low nutrition-value —such as
dry, mature pasture or cereal-
stubbles —has given better re-
sults when sprayed with a mix-
ture of urea-molasses in water
than the concentrate mixtures,
seed residues and meatmeals
formerly used.
Care is needed in using urea
—too much can be toxic.
Cattle, grown sheep or weaners
vary in the amount they can
consume without harm. Good
judgment is also necessary in
estimating the amount of dry-
feed to the acre, and stocking
accordingly.
Spraying is economic, the
only equipment needed being
a boom-spray and either a
tractor, Land-Rover or jeep.
The reason this method cannot
at present be used on a general
scale is shortage of molasses —
therefore research-workers, led
by Dr. D. E. Tribe, are now
experimenting with alterna-
tives. For spraying a sub-
stance must be soluble in water,
palatable, and rich in sugars
or some other energy-food.
Because wheat is readily avail-
able, experiments were started
to try to produce a “wheat-
molasses” that would be satis-
factory from both the economic
and nutritional points of view.
Indiscriminate spraying can
have bad results. If barley-
grass pastures are so treated
the land becomes denuded of
grass and left open to erosion;
also, increased stocking to the
acre in the absence of rain
could sicken the soil and result
in an increase of stock-
diseases.
Best results seem to come
from spraying rough feed such
as tussocks and stubble, con-
verting it to palatable bulk-
food, and thereby doing away
with burning-off in autumn. ,

New season
for Peaches
“Lyra”: In Queensland’s
Granite Belt several varieties
of early peaches, including
Mayflower and High’s Early
Canada, drop their buds after
a mild winter.
For four years officers of
the Agricultural Department
have been trying to remedy
this, and have developed a
chemical - spray compound,
known as D.N.C.H.P., which
“winters” peach-crops in
summer. Research - workers
can p red i c t whether spraying
will be necessary in any par-
ticular year by calculations
based on the daily minimum
temperatures in May, June and
July.
After a mild winter, trees
sprayed with D.N.C.H.P. have
produced a normal commercial
crop of fruit.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST.
(24/3/’60)
Queensland may have poor rainfall during April,
although heavy falls are likely on the north-coastal areas
and the Peninsula, with moderate rain in a section of the
central and south-coastal districts. There should be good
rains in the south-eastern .districts during May and in eastern
Queensland during June.
In N.S.W. there should be moderate rains in coastal
districts during April, but poor falls elsewhere. Good
general rains are likely during May, heavy on the coast, the
Southern Tablelands and part of the South-west Slopes, and
with serious flooding possible in the eastern half of the State.
Good follow-on rains are likely in June.
Victoria should have only light patchy rains during
April, with good general rains to follow in May. Apart
from good falls in September, rainfall looks like being patchy
in the second half of the year.
The agricultural areas and west coast of South Australia
should have moderate rains during April, although rainfall
may be poor elsewhere. Good general rains are likely in
the agricultural areas during May, but falls may be poor in
the interior.
Western Australia may have only poor rainfall during
April, apart from good rains in the lower south-coastal
districts and around Eucla. The s.-w. agricultural areas
can expect moderately good rains in May.

In prose, on the other hand, though
there is his astonishing remark that
Dr. Colin Roderick’s useful bit of
detective-work in the introduction to
“Ralph Rashleigh” was “of greater
fascination to many readers than
Tucker’s story itself,” though Hay is “no

and though there is an inapt compari-
son of Brian James with Steele Rudd,
I see that I have found him informa-

generally satisfactory on a variety of
writers from Hay and Furphy to
Katharine Prichard, Miles Franklin.

"Now Read On”
It would seem from Never Kill a
Dolphin (Fortitude Press, Brisbane),
an anthology mainly of short-stories,
published by the Writers’ Guild of
Queensland as a centenary gesture, that
far too many of these possibly young
writers have never given a thought to
what is their purpose in writing a short-
story —why are they writing it? What
is the effect going to be on the reader?
A short-story is a picture of life,
granted: and that is about as far as
most of these writers have thought;
except, perhaps, that it is to be a grim
picture, a ruthlessly realistic picture, a
depressing picture. But a story is also,
surely, an interesting narration, some-
thing really worth telling; and it is
also an entertainment, an invitation to
the reader to settle down and, one way
or another, enjoy himself.
Now, in the title-story by Roy
Theodore and Dominic Wilson, the
opening gambit is about the cruelty of
killing dolphins. It looks ominous. It
is always possible that the reader will
not want to read about cruelty to
dolphins; and if occasionally he should
do so, for the good of his soul, because
life is like that, he has as yet, from
the style, no guarantee that the experi-
ence here is going to be worth endur-
ing. But then, also in the opening,
there is the suggestion that there is
going to be a fight," even a shooting,
“trobble,” between the other fishermen
and the Balt who does the killing; and
a fight (such is the nature of man),
especially a fight on a fishing-launch
far out at sea, is always interesting.
So, too, for that matter, is fishing.
And, in fact, the reader who decides
to accept Theodore’s and Wilson’s
invitation is in for a considerable treat:
with much “trobble,” much good
fishing and some illicit love-affairs with
a wandering Maori girl thrown-in for
good measure. It is the wildest of
melodrama, and the episode when the
aboriginal boy ties the rope round the
Balt’s leg so that the dolphin will drag
him overboard and drown him is a bit
too much to take; but it is good melo-
drama —it makes you think that the
spirit of Randolph Bedford still lives
among Queensland writers—and the
setting is as convincing as it is salty.
But what is the unfortunate reader to
do when faced with the opening of
Noni Braham’s “The Leany Tree”: —
“What can you expect in this
His mother's voice rang
out harsh and bitter... .The lines
around her mouth showed deep and
ugly, and her thin body shook under
her shapeless print frock. “It
destroys everything—everything.”
“Now read on,” says the author in
effect, as every author says at the begin-
ning of a story; and who is really going
to be tempted to read on from there?
Is it, one asks with fear and trembling,
to be the suffering outback housewife
again? It is. Is it. since there is also
a small boy suffering for his chickens
in the opening, to be the miseries, the
disillusions, the despair of childhood
again? It is. Does it finish with the
boy sobbing? It does.
Again in the next story. James
Meade’s “The Running of the Boar”:
a boy, in great detail, is cutting the
throat of a sheep. And now, if you
like to read about sheep having their
throats cut, or feel you must, read on
. . . Though, in fact, the running of a
boar, as mentioned in the title, helps
to make this story a little more tempt-
ing, as long as the pig, too, is not going
to have its throat cut; and in the end
this turns out to be a melodrama about
the boy trying to shoot his father.
Or take, again, a phrase in the open-
ing of Lyn Phillips’s “The Holiday”-
“From the nearby parallel highway an
asphalted road led to the beach; a
street with facial eczema, pustules of
tar raised by the sun.” Do we go on
from there, to read more about facial
eczema? If we don’t, as it happens,
we miss an experimental love-story,
essentially lyrical and of some promise;
but we may well be put off from the
start. Or take the start of May Milne’s
“The Schoolteacher” “Mrs. Bale’s
voice ran on and on petulantly.” Are
we really tempted by this scene of
petulance over the sausages?
So much seems worth saying: not
because these writers are without merit
or promise, but because you do not find
Chekhov or Maupassant or Conrad
opening their short-stories with dead
animals, facial eczema and dismal
housewives all over the place.
For the rest, this is a very mixed
anthology of stories, verse and plays,
Many of Queensland’s best-known con-i
temporary writers are omitted; and
those who are included, though R. S.
Porteous and E. A. Gollschewsky are
up to standard, are not at their best.
The lesser-known writers are at their
best in good melodrama and at their
worst in bad. The illustrator, for some
mysterious reason, shows the old man
in Judith Wright’s story looking as
robust as Tarzan.
Indoor Plants
There are many books about indoor
plants today and one book is not likely
to be much better than another; but at
least Patricia Jarrett’s Indoor Plants
(Rigby Ltd., Adelaide) has the advant-
ages that it is written for Australian
conditions and, being a modest little
(illustrated) paperback, is likely to be
cheaper than most.
One of Miss Jarrett’s most engaging
paragraphs is her defence of the
aspidistra —“Despite all the comic
songs and scathing jokes, it is still the
toughest and least troublesome of all
indoor plants” —and another is her
account of the ferocious Dieffenbachia,
or Dumb Cane,
....a group of both plain and
variegated, large-leaved plants which
are very adaptable as house-plants.
They should not be used where there
are young children, as any part of
the plants placed in the mouth will
cause great pain and loss of voice.
With a short introduction explaining
that indoor plants (like housewives)
should not be left too long in the
kitchen in the fumes of the gas-stove,
otherwise they will wilt, Miss Jarrett
covers her subject from A to Z
(Adiatum to Zebrina); and, generally,
with much good advice about pinching;
plants in the proper places and pounc-
ing on aphis and mealy-bugs, demon-j
strates how lively and rewarding a,
hobby the growing of indoor plants
can be.

ventures of the father. William
Mortimer.
A well-defined character, arrogant
and foolish, yet pathetic in his vulner-
ability. Mortimer is the motivating
force throughout. The contrasting
childish courage of his daughter
Elizabeth is very sincerely imagined.
There is a weakness in the book in
that it proceeds by a series of remotely-
related incidents rather than along a
firm and logical story-line. The
aborigines whom one meets in the first
chapter have nothing to do with the
plot, the millionaire who is outwitted
by the mining community threatens
vengeance but becomes a very dim and
distant figure thereafter, and the
schoolmistress who recognises Eliza-
beth's quality and makes a friend of
her vanishes completely as the tale
goes on. Too much of potential
interest is introduced and then for-
gotten. too little explored with
thoroughness: as if the author had not
yet fully thrown off the short-story
technique.
The U.S. Social Climb
In The Status Seekers (Longmans)
Vance Packard is out to show that
United States society, despite its record
spread of wealth and its professions of
sturdy egalitarianism, is getting more
and more rigidly stratified into' classes,
and that social success is so much
prized and so subtly measured that it
is harder for able members of the lower
dasses to “up-grade” themselves than
at any other time in American history
—in fact, harder in some ways than it
now is in parts of Europe.
Packard does not supply enough
evidence to make a sceptical reader who
has been to Europe accept the last
part of this proposition; but when he
is listing the more curious ways in
which U.S. citizens today project their
social ambitions he is never less than
lively.
It is stimulating, for example, to
learn of such status-symbols as the air-
conditioned doghouse, the 50ft. TV-
aerial. the gold-plated bathroom fixture
(a “conversation piece”), the 40.000-
dollar houses sold as “love symbols”
to the “neglected” wives of preoccu-
pied businessmen and thoughtfully pro-
vided with a “love couch” in the
master-bedroom for “marital courting,”
and so on. But, with all the shadings
of individual human behavior within
the pattern necessarily left out —and
this is the weakness of most works of
popular sociology—the book is really
little more than an extended magazine-
feature with a few morals added (it
even includes a questionnaire of the
“How is your class-rating?” type).
One cannot object to any of
Packard’s worthy pleas —for a weaken-
ing of class and racial barriers and for
a wider-ranging system of high-school
and university scholarships (in which
matter the U.S. seems to be fa, behind
Australia and England) —but they have
been made many times before, and on
much stronger grounds.
The essential slightness of the book
becomes even more apparent in its
conclusions:—
The forces of the times seem to
be conspiring to squeeze individuality
and spontaneity from us. We com-
pete for the same symbols of bigness
and success. We are careful to con-
form to the kinds of behavior
approved by our peers. We are wary
of others who don’t look like our
kind of people. We tend to judge
people by their labels. And all too
often we judge people on the basis
of the status symbols they display
Which would be just as true super-
ficially. and just as untrue in depth,
of the U.S. as of any other society
anywhere, any time.
Much Perelman
The Most of S. J. Perelman (Heine-
mann). a large volume drawn from
thirty years of his output, reveals the
Marx brothers’ former scriptwriter as
a humorist of much greater range than
this reviewer, for one, had thought him
to be.
Restless, seemingly undisciplined,
but shrewd, the Perelman mind flutters
across the American scene, searching
like a bower-bird for the telling bits
of colored glass, paper and rag in
magazines, newspapers, pulp-novels,
trade-papers, catalogues, films and
show-business, feverishly working the
absurdities out of them in a parody
style compounded of them all He
also has a large collection of voguish
foreign phrases, a firm grip on the
fashionable literature of his time —
Proust. Joyce. Eliot. Stein, etc. —and
a considerable skill at punning and
mixing styles for comic effect.
On occasion he can produce a piece
of deadpan satire, in the key of
Lardner. on some of the more
grotesque denizens of Hollywood and
Broadway; or a fluent review of a
sensational best-seller or film of thirty-
odd years back; or a long report on a
muddled trip round the world, mixing
wild humor with shrewd journalism.
Yet, for all their energy and brilliance,
his pieces are always synthetic and
never as truly funny as Thurber’s, with
their quieter, more relaxed style.
Reviewed Briefly
The Adventures of Ulysses: Jacques
le Marchand, illustrated by Andre
Francois, translated by E. M. Hatt. A
bright, chatty, colloquial version of the
traditional story retold for children and
decorated with gay childish drawings.
Circe’s blue pigs are quite captivating
and the prose-style, if you can bear it,
is amusing; but on the whole it would
really be much better if the child were
sent mercilessly away to read Homer
—in the original Greek.

No Surrender: Robert Harbinson
(Faber). The story of a boy raised in
poverty in the back-streets of Belfast.
It could be life in back-streets any-
where, but is infused with the constant
religious and political strife that
divides Protestant and Catholic Ulster
-—hence, the title. The narrative of
the boy growing-up and learning the
meaning of life, helped by a fiercely
gallant mother, is finely done and the
author has caught the true Belfast
atmosphere, with the green mountains
of County Down always visible at the
end of the grimiest city-streets.

Quiet as Moss: Andrew Young
(Rupert Hart-Davis). Thirty-six poems
chosen by Leonard Clark and decor-
ated with wood-engravings by Joan
Hassall. For the reader familiar with
Davies and Blunden. Andrew Young is
nearly always a little less, therefore
disappointing; but every now and
again, as in “In the Fallow Field.” he
sees something that hasn’t been noted
before in the English countryside and
puts it down pleasantly and concisely.
