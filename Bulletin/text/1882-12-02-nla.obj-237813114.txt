Wisdom and Ability.
Among our many reasons (or hoping that the elections
may prova fatal to the effhial career of the present
Ministry is the prospect of having a new Minister of
Justice and a new Attorney-General. We have a good
many things to say about the Honorable Water-Jog
Foster ; but he must wait while we out upon the
Attorney-General. Mr. Wisdom is a very good fellow,
and honest as the world goes, even though they did try
to drag him into the Lucas affair. Bat be is xot a
lawyer in the sense of knowing much law or seriously
making the law his profession. It wonld seem that he
hardly pretends to be a barrister, yet he is the “ leader
of the bar" and dispenser of a very large amount of
patronage for the very proper dispensing of which a
knowledge of other men’s legal acquirements is requi-
site; and ho represents, in important legal questions
that are eternally cropping up, the law adviser of the
Crown, or in other words, dear publio, the legal ad-
viser of us all. Mr. Wisdom is rarely or ever seen in a
criminal case, nor do the solicitors appear to rush after
him in civil actions. We hope soon to find some really
able lawyer occupying the highest position in the
Government, and to see Mr. Wisdom confining himself
to politics for the future—so far at least as this bleeding
country is concerned. The Opposition has some
barristers of distinction. Mr. Pilches would make an
able Attorney-General. The ordinary client feels on
the high road to victory if he has enlisted ; Mr.
Pilcher’s help, and the country has a right to demand
as goad advica and as able advocacy as an
ordinary suitor. Mr. Reid and Mr, Barton,
and now the latest comer, Mr. Bruce Smith , are all
men of ability, and the youngest of them probably
makes more by his profession than the law advisers of
the Crown combined. Then, as .to the style in which
Mr. Wisdom has been dispensing patronage. We alto-
gether deny that appointments with such considerable
emoluments, and of such great importance, should be
given to men whose vary beat qualification is that we
know nothing of them. Is it that the Attorney-Genera’,
feeling a consciousness of merit disregarded by solicitors
has come to associate brieflessness with intellectual
eminence P Or is it an ignorance of the Bar duo to his
absence from the courts that leads him to narrow his
range of selection te those only whom he knows in his
moments of conviviality P Whatever the oanse, the
colony {knows the result in bungled prosecutions and
felons loose on the community. Let ns advise oar
Attorney-General—we wonld almost say let us instruct
him, only we feel sure he he has long since got oat of
the habit of reading “ Instructions.” Let him, what-
ever comes, no longer keep up the farce of being the
head of the profession of the law, but go in for politics
pure and simple—that is to say, if politics ever become
pure and simple. Ha will then be doing his duty, with-
out feeling, as he must feel now, that he occupies a false
position, both with regard to tho country, whose ser-
vant he is, and to the profession of which he is the
nominal—and but the nominal—head.
Concerning a certain Labour Agency.
Amongst other harpies who live to pluck human pigeons
and fatten upon the distress of their fellows, some labour
agents take a, very prominent place. Here’s an instance.
The other day, “ a corresponding clerk for the country”
was advertised for in the S. M. Herald, applications
being directed to be made to a certain institution in
Sydney which has sprung into notoriety chiefly through
the connection therewith of an individual who, if he be
honourable, must have been very badly maligned both
here and in the other colonies. A man applied, and was
asked by the “ manager " of this institution what amount
he would give if the situation were procured fer him.
He offered to pay 10 per cent, upon the first quarter's
salary, the screw being given as £3 15s. per week. Next
he offered to pay £5. But the manager was inexorable.
“ My terms are,” said he, “ £5 down and £1 per week
for three weeks—£8 in all.” The applicant was to pay
his own fare up-country, and receive the amount back
if he stayed six months, or a part of it proportionate to
the time he did stay. If he paid down the £5, he was
to sign an agreement to serve his prospective master
for six months, but he could not gat a reciprocally-
signed agreement until he arrived at his mister’s plaee
in person. So it occurred to the applicant that possibly
all tliat was required of him was to pay the £5 deposit
and depart on a fool’s errand, only to find that his
supposed master—if, indeed, such a person existed—had
engaged somebody else in the meantime. However, he
offered to deposit £5 with some person in trust to be
paid to this institution after he had received the billet-
This offer was indignantly refused by the manager, who
said he didn’t want outsiders to know how he conducted
his business. We should rather think he doesn't 1
Employers would be much better suited, and would
confer a boon upon unemployed struggling men, if they
ceased to employ these blood-suckers as go-betweens
Of course, this leech of a manager, besides closing on
the applicant’s £8, would also “ collar” the employer’s
commission.
Here is a hit from a journalist’s letter: —A
real American revivalist came aboard the s.s. City
of New York at Honolulu on her last trip, and travelled
with her to ’Frisco. This little incident serves power
fully to illustrate the advantage of travel. Stay-at.
home Australians have entirely erroneous ideas about
Amurrikan revivalists, and are liable to be imposed
upon by unscrupulous pretenders. Their conceptions
respecting the species are drawn from observation o£
Father Chiniquy and Joe Cook. This is all wrong.
The genuine Amurrikan revivalist does not wear badly,
fitting black clothes and a white tie, and—this is an
important feature —does not shave the upper lip. The
certified specimen aboard the City of New York sports
striped tweed inexpressibles, superflde black saxony
twilled coat and vest (“our own make, to measure”),
stand-up all-round collar, a speckled tie with a gold
eameo pin, and was strong in white cuffs with swell gold
and enamel sleeve-studs. He wears a moustache, and
has a keen, business-like expression, instead of tho
greasy angelic smile of the Coox-CHiNiqur variety—a
smile as of a seraph who had successfully robbed a bee.
hive. It seems probable that Chiniquy and Cook got
themselves up specially for the Australian trade, and
employed the time on the voyage from Amurrika in
growing whiskers, shaving their moustaches, and prac-
tising the Australian parsons’ mouth-stretcher, so as
not to alarm local prejudices at the outset. But they
differ from the genuine article in another and more
essential respect. They don’t know what they are
taking about. He does. He has been there all the
time. The first part of his pitch is all about his own
past iniquities, and is extremely interesting and
piquante. When members of choirs and habitues of
Sunday-school picnics go to be revived by a genuine re-
souler, they want to take along pocket-handkerchiefs
and fans, or fire-screens. The latter are very useful in
preventing their burning blushes from scorching the
people in the pew in front. This particular re-
vivalist has been beautifully wicked. He says so
himself, and he ought to know. He doesn’t,
to a person with Australian preconceptions, look
as though he had been revived at all. If one had
not positive assurance that he is a hall-marked 18-carat
revivalist, we would judge, from appearances, that he
was a three-up or monte sharp. You can see some very
good samples, so far as appearances go, of revivalists in
front of Tattersall’s, any day. But there is no decep-
tion. This is a guaranteed article. He has made more
money out of the revival business than any other on
this side of the Eocky Mountains. He has thrice
visited Honolulu, and is now returning after his third
visit. The first time he drew splendidly. All the white
residents rolled up, and each had several dollars’ worth
of repentance. The leading citizens and their families
took the whole course, and there was a holy ardour and
blessed rivalry as to who should lay in the biggest
stock of grace while the season lasted. His Most
Sacred Majesty the King himself was deeply stirred,
and it is understood that he offered the Man of Gawd
the first-class decoration of the Order of Kamehameha
for a Heavenly crown. There was some difficulty about
the deal, however. The revivalist got one of the
Knights of the Order privately to let him have a sight
of the insignia, and observed that they wouldn’t “ go
up” for more than fifty dollars in ’Frisco. He was
deeply agitated and distressed when next His Majesty
renewed the offer. He said that earthy gauds and
frivolities were not for him, and lamented to think that
the King should expect to gain salvation by a sacrifice
which would cost him nothing. (The expense of con.
ferring distinctions is defrayed out of the general
revenue, not out of the Privy purse). The opinion
current is that had His Majesty bethought him to
tender five hundred dollars for the revivalist’s
proposed college for young converted priests, he
might now have been the registered lessee of a
first-class Throne of Glory. But the miscarriage
of this little c*n version threw a certain chill upon the
mission. His Majesty did not scruple to remark in the
midst of his Court that the whole] thing was a blank
farce, and after that it was scarcely considered good
form to be converted. The missionary had to be con-
tent to sail for 'Frisco with only about five hundred
saved sonls and five thousand saved dollars. He seems
to have devoted his time during the voyage to study of
the Fathers. Be Imitatione Christi seems to have seized
his imagination, (or he is reported to have carried the
principle so far as to descend into Hell as soon as he
landed. That ia to say, into a gambling-hell, where he
was skinned of his five thousand dollars. What
became of the souls is uncertain. He went back to
Honolulu in quest of more—souls, of course, and

again did pretty well, tout not so well as at first. To
'Frisco once more, and then this third time to Hono-
lulu. Ha has been able to save ns white souls this
trip. He had 11 gone through " that class of souls so
thoroughly daring his former visit that they were as
completely “revived” as the dress-coat of a Hum
society reporter, and couldn’t stand any more. Ho has
converted the natives this bout. He had forgotten
about them the first two visits. They are supposed to
have quite as many souls, man for man, as the whites ;
but they have not quite so many dollars. Perhaps this
accounts for the previons oversight. Anyhow he has
saved them this trip, and when Jo&s Davits goes to
Heaven, and takes big swigs of iced-vigorinein full view
of The Bulletin men frying in the other place (to
aggravate them), he will probably, meet some Kanakas
from Honolulu. They ate very good company , ugly
perhaps, but after all not so ugly as the devil. But
this revivalist is the genuine article. He doesn’t talk
in vague generalities, like the Australian frauds in that
line. Ha doesn't, like them, pretends that he has been
as pure and innocent as John Davies, all his life. No;
there’s no sort of wickedness he doesn’t olaim to have
been boss of. He knows exactly what it all amounts
to, and is thoroughly competent to show the way how
not to do it.”
Sir Henry’s ostensible reason for proposing to erect a
Picture Gallery on the site of the Garden Palace was the
improvement of the city, as seen from the water, by
placing a fine tower or dome in a commanding position.
To attain this, he wanted all the architects of the
colonies to submit competitive designs. Now, if that
object, one worthy of serious consideration, had really
been the end sought, it could have been attained at
touch less expense, and without casting a deliberate
Blight ®n the Colonial Architect, to whom Sydney is
already indebted for some of its finest buildings, and
without scattering far and wide, all over the city, the
cognate institutions of Art and Science. It may not be
generally known that there is, in the Free Library, a
design prepared some few years since by the Colonial
Architect, for an extension of the Museum to afford
space for, in addition to the present Museum of Natural
History, the Free Public Library, Art Gallery, Tech-
nological Museum, and other Art and Science institu-
tions. The site is a most commanding one. A large
building there would be visible from the harbour and
would group well with the spires which will some day
crown the neighbouring cathedral. The position is as
nearly central as any that can be selected, being easily
available from all the suburbs by rail, tram, or steam.
The Australian Museum, as it at present stands, is
inexpressibly hideous. But, were Mr. Barnet’s plan
carried out, the front of the building would face
■William-street, and to Sydney would he given, at
a comparatively trifling cost, an edifice which
(though it might not suit neither the popularity-
hunting hangers-on of the highly-cultured and artistic
Sir Henrt, nor the Michael Angelos and Inigo
Joneses who want to display their architectural ability
at the expense of the State) would he a “ thing of
beauty"—and, better still, a thing of beauty in the
right place.
Who is Garbett?
Who is Garbett ? What is Garbett ? Is Garbett an
engineer, an English capitalist, or a Russian million-
aire ? These are questions which have been on the
lips of everybody for the last ten or twelve days. All
that we know for certain regarding Garbett is, that
his arrival in New South Wales was contemporaneous
with that of His Excellency Lord Augustus Loftus,
and that he has been a resident at Government House
since his arrival. Never having been gazetted, how.
ever, to any position on the stall, “ Society ’’ —es-
pecially the female half of it—has been always very
curious relative to Garbett. Several theories have
b:en put forward in explanation of Garbett’s position.
Some we may, and some we may not, mention. One
theory is that Garbett is purveyor to the household,
and undertakes everything “in a line,” from breakfast
to supper, at so much per head per diem ; and that
having made a good thing out of it at the Embassy at
St. Petersburg, he agreed to carry on in Sydney ;
another theory is that Garbett is a swell parlour,
hoarder, whose weekly contribution, notwithstanding
the fact that he plays a good knife and fork, helps to
make both ends meet; while a third, not so compli-
mentary to Garbett, is that he is the fowl-house man,
and gets his keep, but no pay, for looking after the
Brahmas and Cochin-Chinas. We need hardly say that
we credit none of these jocular suppositions. Now that
Garbett has become a public character, and that the
Ministry have in a way pledged the revenue to the tune
of 3* per cent, for interest on a proposed outlay of close
upon a million, we have a right to ask for definite
information as to Garbett. Who, then, is Garbett ?
Does Garbett represent English, or Russian, or
Colonial capital ? Is Garbett the agent of Loftus and
Co., or Somebody Else and Co. ? In short, who, if any-
body, is in this gigantic swim with Garbett ? Let us
have it all out. The East Sydney Ballot-box alone can
tell us.
DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
A New Zealand paper, which lately interviewed
pome Mortuen elders, naively observes that theyjexbibit
eh "air of conviction quite as real to all appearance as
that shown by members of other ohnrches.*' Well, 11
they don’t exhibit any more " flxity-of tenure ” in their
convictions than the majority of onr so-called Christian
Sabbatarian church-goers, we wouldn’t give a four-and-
ninepenny Coonanbara hat for the strength of their
tenets.
Elders Hansen and Farr are stumping New
Zealand on a Mormon Crusade. At Wellington, they
fell amongst the Philistines. They called a meeting of
presumed sympathisers, by circular, but some practical
jokers managed to get the hall filled up with aa hot and
humorous a crowd as the capital of N.Z. could produce.
Elder Parr went over the old Mormon yarns about Joe
smith and the angel Maroni, when a man with a jaw
like a prize-fighter got up and offered to bet a fiver that
Smith only saw the ghost of Pat. Maloney, and that his
alleged trance was a drunken coma. The chairman was
a Mr. Dwan, and he suddenly astonished the meeting
by “ shutting up” Elder Parr, on the gronnd that he
was not an " elder ” but a “ younger," and a natural,
born liar to boot. This served to spice things up gene-
rally, and was followed by the chairman showing the
crowd that he had burst his waistcoat buttons with
laughter. He added that Mormonism was the greatest
lie ever foisted upon the world. Then it transpired
that Dwan had himself been to Utab and a physiognomist
present discovered a striking resemblance between him
and the “ younger elder,” and wanted to know whether
Dwan ever had Dwandered in the paths of Brigbamy.
Then Farr said that the angel Maroni was a better man
than anybody present ever would be—a remaik that was
resented by a man on the platform pulling away the
elder’s chair jnst as be was going to sit down. After
this, nothing weald soothe the irritated meeting bat t
gehottisehe qz) »n instrument which called an
American lyre, thus giving an amiable wit present an
opportunity to remark .that they had probably just
heard the worst liar America could produce. There
were no women present at the meeting—a fact which
can never be sufficiently regretted.
Our dear old ohum, the irreverend Dowie, has
“ struck it rich" over at Collingwood, Victoria. He
has succeeded to theEmpire of Mr, Cherbury's “Taber-
nacle," Sackville-street, Collingwood ; and has already
made some bits over the chains in hunting tbe devil,
and blackguarding everybody who won’t contribute to
“ the cause.” It's a fine thing now-a-daye to have a
11 cause” te hump aloft in the eyes of the public. It
helps tbe butcher's bill along, and it buys the child a
frock. Well, when Cherb ary was boss of the Taber-
nacle show, one of his prominent and moat respected
choir-members was a young saint named Edwards, who,
however, wouldn’t cotton te the Irrav. Dowis’s little
game. Dowie immediately excommunicated Edwards,
and dismissed him from the Tabernacle. Edwards re-
mained in sorrow outside the Tabernacle during service,
but was almost immediately handed over by police-
sergeant Fenton to constable Peroival. Be it here
understood that Fenton is tbe sergeant in charge of
the Collingwood Police Station. He is a mournful
individual, who dabbles in chemistry and religion, and
is an out-and-out teetotaller. An Age reporter, visiting
the Collingwood Police Court for the first time, onos
asked sergeant Fenton “ whathe would have P" The ser-
geant sternly replied by demanding what the rep. meant
by attempting to bribe the “ fooroe.” Next came a long
lecture about “ touch not,” &o., and “ it bitetb like an
adder.” Then Fenton explained that the wine used at
tbe marriage-feast at Cana in Galilee, was an unfer-
mented liquor, quite innocuous, and informed the
pressman that he hadlots of nnfermeated wine which ho
had himself manufactured at his laboratory. It was
all the same to the ungodly scribe, so the latter " cot-
toned on,” and was duly liquored up by his new friend
the sergeant. The representative, when interviewed by
the sub-editor that night in reference to ‘•copy,” could
only fork oat a bundle of hell-fire tracts, and murmur
something about •• snakebite and usual antidote.” But
this is flippant, and by the way. Constable Peroival,
having received the excommunieated chairman Xd wards
from the sergeant, waltzed his prisoner off to the look-
up. Then Peroival began to scratch his ear with his
baton. He weuld’nt sign the charge-sheet, because he
didn’t know of what offence Edwards was to be accused.
Edwards’ case was dismissed, and Peroival was in.
dieted before the Superintendent of Police for 11 in-
subordination.” Moral: Always "go blind” when yonr
superior officer eggs yon en, Edwards is now “ going
for" Fenton for £500 for false imprisonment.
The Sydney people have swallowed church
raffles, cathedral “ theay tree," ecclesiastical Punch and
Judy’s, and consecrated bumt-eork business. Welling-
ton, N Z , has swallowed still more. It has swallowed
holy rump-steak-and-oyster suppers. The new idea is
simple, but lovely. Instead of organising tea-fights, the
wardens of one of the local fanes there provide the
luscious bivalve and the Juicy grill, "it a high tariff of
charges." The thing is done “ in slap-np style," and
there are lady waitresses and all that sort of thing.
Facilis descensus averni! The transition from this kind of
affair to a church free-and-easy, with "tanglefoot" ad. lib.
and the organ pealing out at 2 a.m. "We won’t go home
till morning," should be easy.
More “ larx ” up in the Far North, at Ravens-
wood this time. A Protestant (male) and a Catholic
(female) get married in the Anglican style of nuptial
architecture, so to speak. Later on, a Catholic priest
tells the wife that she is only " living in adultery,"
and the marriage is gone through again—this time in
the homan style. Bat the priest doesn’t send in a
registration certificate, and he is prosecuted and fined.
Whereupon the Bavenswood editor wants to have the
prosecuting official hanged and.the fine refunded. Then,
of course. Charters Towers' Thady O’Kane wires in,
and consigns the whole crowd to perdition in his
choicest French.
The prayer which the Archbishop of Canter-
bury recently commended to the clergy of the Church
of England, was worded a* little differently from the
following, but it mas the same in spirit and intent: —
* Oh Almighty God, whose power no creature is able
to resist unless supported by efficient artillery, keep, we
beseech Thee, our soldiers and sailors who have gone
forth to cut tho throats of the soldiers and sailors of ,
Egypt, that they (our crowd), being armed with Thy
defence, may be preserved evermore from what they
enlisted far, to glorify Thee, who art the giver ol all
victory, through the merits of Thy servant, Wolseley.
Amen." We have somewhat toned down the blasphemy
of this precious composition in deference to the delicate
understandings of our local divines, who are sorely
shocked by all kinds of impiety except their own.
A new occupier of the Sydney Freethought plat-
form made her appearance at the Unitarian Church
last Sunday, in Mrs. E. L. Watson, of America. The
building was quite full, and many persons stood through
the lecture. Her topic was the “ Ministry of Angels
and her contention, that matter and spirit are both
immortal, they do sot die, but merely change their form
and location; that they always work in harmony with
laws, and that death, so-called, does not rend the bond
of communication between earthly and heavenly bodies.
The speaker used this remarkable sentence: " If we are
immortal, we are so not through the grass of our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ, but in accordance with
natural and immutable laws." The keynote of the
address was the thesis, supported by argument, that
"millions of spiritual creatures walk the eerth nn-
seen” (as the great old blind poet said), who fulfil their
mission by exercising an influence over us. Mrs.
Watson claims to receive inspirational aid, and to speak
quite extemporaneously. There is nothing striking
about the lady’s appearance: of medium figure, in a
dark costume with lace held at the throat with dia-
monds, and on the breast with flowers ; she had a pale,
but, when speaking, exceedingly animated and intelli-
gent face, and crimped black hair. Her language la
undoubtedly eloquent.
St. Andrew’s Church, Hobart, is a kirk with a
history. It was within its sacred, precincts that tha
Btv. John considered by his unco gnid con-
gregation to have one day preached the doctrine of tran-
substantiatioa. The Presbytery were of the same
mind as the people, and Mr. Storie was disrobed. How-
ever, when the Minister appointed to preach the Church
vacant found his way into the pulpit, be ascertained
that the hev. John had been sitting there for three
hours before the service commenced. It may be un-
derstood who preached that day. Storie next pro-
ceeded against the members of the Presbytery, from
the Moderator downwards, and taking them in tarn,
made paupers of all; in fact, be veritably broke up the
Church in the colony. For the next seventeen or
eighteen years the rev. firebrand preached to a congre-
gation of a few score, but continued to draw a hand-
some salary under State-aid and live in a pala-
tial manse. Three or four years ago, the pres-
byters , who had, phoeiix-like, risen from their
ashes, once more tackled the recalcitrant, and by
the aid of the editor of the Mercury, himself
a cleric in disguise, passed an Act which brought St.
Andrew's within the power of the governing body of the
Church. Then John Storie retired to Scotland with a
snug pension, and a mortgage over the grand organ on
account of law expenses. Within the last few
months another scene has been added to the drama.
A new paper called tho Southern Stab wai issued in
Hobart about three months ago, and in almost its first
isane a letter appeared from which it was gathered
that the hev. James Scott, an admitted writer for the
Mercury, and the minuter who now bolds forth in the
kirk, baa gens into the schoolroom over which the
lieutenants of Mr. Storie still asserted sway, and seeing
a figure in the dark, said: “ Is that yon, Miss —— ?’*
The figure turned out to be a man, and Mr. Scott soon
saw the incident photographed in a very equivocal light
in the new paper. The writer's nacre was given up,
and it turned out to be that of Mr. John Ocllie, who
had been associated with Storie in all his campaign*.
On tbe 14th Noy. an action for libel was tried at
Hobart, in which Mr. Scott received £25 damages from
Mr. Oellie and the proprietors ol the Star as joint
defendants. There was a heavy bar, the leaders being
Mr. Oiblin, Mr. Byron Miller, and Mr. C. H. Bromby.
The latter gentleman defended the paper, of which he is
understood to be a contributor, and as usual made a
splendid appeal on behalf of his clients. Nextmerning
the Mercury attacked Mr. Brombv in language worthy
of Billingsgate, and this is how the next Stab speaks
out; —” The coal attack in this morning’s Mbbcurt on
a counsel wbo was doing his duty is one which hs can
treat with the contempt it deserves. That gentleman’s
reputation is too high to be injured by anything
□tiered by a person of the&ntecedsnts of the Mercury’s
Editor.”

the Anti-Polygamy Law, which imposes suffrage dis-
abilities on all persons cohabiting with more than one
woman. The Mormon saints think they can evade this
act. They propose to give each wife a separate house,
and leave the officers of the law to prove, if they can,
that any saint lives with more than one Dear old
Dowie —the very irreverend Dowie we moan, of course
—is eclipsing all his past mountebank antics. He
places Jimmy Muuro, who, though bald, is very “ hot-
headed,” in the front rank of legislative betrayers of
the temperance cause, and promised to hold up to the
public acorn men who occupied high positions in the
Church of Christ, and planted “groggetias " in every
lane for the sale of liquor to the occupants cf every
small cottage Committee of the Mechanic’s Insti-
tute, Singleton, decided hy 5 to 3 not to opea reading
room and library on Sunday...From a long rigmarole,
chiefly composed ef the words, bigotry, superstition,
clericalism, vigilance, socialistic, dogmatics hem, malig-
nity, tyrannism, democracy, toryism, freethonght, and
Presbyterianism, all jammed together, we pick out the
information that a branch of the Liberal Society has
been formed in West Maitland... A Canadian bishop has
published a pastoral forbidding tbe ladies of his
diocese to wear frizzed hair and artificial bangs. This
is the kind of prelate we want out here. Only we
wouldn't want him te stop at the head. We would
like him to prohibit padding, condemn tight corsets,
an ithem&tise high heels, and damn feminine deception
of all sorts. What a good and ugly lot his congrega-
tion would be I But no, there isn’t a woman—an un-
married woman, anyhow—this side of Paradise, who
wonld make a dowdy of herself in this world for all
the crowns of glory that were ever manufactured
in the Brummagem of the next In 1882,
Judge Brett decided that by the English laws,
wbioh are not yet repealed, Unitarians, professing their
creed, were guilty of blasphemy and punishable upon
conviction Recently, Henry Ward Beeeher (the
Rev. H. W. B , of course), informed his flock that he
had net changed his belief any in thirty-five years.
That may be so; but the public has changed its ideas
concerning Mr. Beeeher pretty considerably during that
time Rev Mr. Leypoldt, Lutheran clergyman of
Sandhurst (Vic.), received a call from the Germans of
Sydney. He immediately set about interpreting what
the Lord's will was—" Go, or stay P” Then his parish-
ioners met, and voted him £50 per annum additional
salary. He stays, and the Lord’s will is done. A
Sandhurst correspondent of our own Morning Rum
says that, the Germans there are " very much
pleased at Leypoldt’s self-abnegation.” General
Booth, who hoeses the Salvation Army, has now
to fight the rivalry of one of Ms own converts—
“ Captain Gipsy Smith." This man, after the fashion
of the orthodox clergy, accepted a presentation of a
gold watch from his Han'ey admirers, and General
Booth promptly cashiered him. Gipsy, however, started
an army of his ewn in the populous districts of Buts-
lem and Stoke, and finds the thing swinging along
grandly. Other “Lieutenants” have also accepted
” testimonials," and, as they all got “sacked," they
went over and joined Gipsy,

I “ A. Spencer-Heathcote, V.C.": You only set us
right as to a certain date. Now, we may be wrong as to
the date, and right on the main facts. If you do not,
meanwhile, dispute these latte* - , we’ll publish your cor-
rection, as to date, in next issue. No necessity for

in our opinion all kleptomaniacs should be kept under

exertion “Vaux"; No, it’s not customary to give the
bridegroom presents. All he gets is the woman, who is
quite enough, and sometimes even too much..." W.A.”:
Thanks, old fellow, for your suggestion. Your verses,
though containing some good lines, are carelessly con-
structed. Now, what stretch of poetical license do you
think would allow yon to rhyme “ rescue" with
" adieu ?“ The piece is too long, anyhow, and wants
planing down in order that its central idea shall be
seen at once. Always glad to hear from you
" Wharfdale”: 1. Thank yeu. Bat wo are not inter-
ested in the yarn of tho flies and the reporter. These
flies were stewed flies, and it’s better for a man to eat
stewed flies than eat nothing 2. We don’t know the
circulation of that dreadful production you mention.
It is hard to gauge the circulation of any paper that is
given away “Martyr"; Not in our style; and,
besides, yonr contribution consists only of our old jokes
hashed up. And there are quite enough people to dish
them up without your adding to the number. Try s une
short pars “ Manly ”: Yon lose your wager. It is
recorded that Professor Billroth, of Vienna, not long
since removed one-third of the stomach of a man wbo

ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST

TN a rooent conversation in Kingston, Canada, with
* * 0 P r «eentatire of one of the foremost journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Trickett, the celebrated
oawaaan, who is at present open to row any man i n the
world, gave the following as his opinion.
"I have found St, JACOB'S Oil a sure and certain
core, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains in back, brought on by over-ex.
ertion in rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sura
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without further trouble.”
The writer listened attentively to the above. It was
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from ona
who know what ho was talking about; and now he sayg
that St. JACOB’S OIL and good jthletie training, ar
what all our young man want.

The immediate effect of Moore’s Electric Bath is
more wonderful than Moore’s Household Remedy Oint-
ment, which removes all pain from a burn or scald in
three to 15 minutes. It is the only ointment that has
certificates of merit from the managers of all the
foundries in Sydney. It acts magically in wounds,
bruises, sores, sun-burns, corps, bunions, and has a
curative effect on lung complaints, when rubbed into
the chest. Every Householder should keep a pot'.

Victoria now has four baronets: Sir George
Farmer, living in retirement near Melbourne, whose
title dates back to 1779, Sir Bryan O’Loghlen, whose
title dates from 1838, dir Arthur Nicholson, and Sir
W. J. Clarke, who has just been created a baronet.
A young man of good family ran away to sea as
a boy, a few years ago, from his noma in England. Of
course, all the romance sooa melted. At Auckland he
deserted the vessel, the British Empire, became a
pauper, was boots at a club, porter at a cordial maker’s,
clerk in a New Caledonia store, and has now just left
Auckland for England again, to inherit £20,000 accruing
to him by his father’s death.
General Songer, the alleged editor of the Ket
West (Fla., U.S.) Democrat, is 21 years of age, his
fighting weight 351b., and his height 40 inches. We are
not informed whether he is single or double, but the
chances are that he is spliced te some gentle creature
of forty, standing about 5 feet 10 in her stockings, and
weighing 2001b. He must be the editor of whom ’twa«
said that, when a man with a shotgun or a horsewhip
calls round, he crawls into the paste pot and pulls down
the lid after him.
In respect to a paragraph which appeared in
The Bulletin, we learn that the Marcus Clarke who
died, while down in luck, at the Dubbo Hospital, was
not related to tke late well-known and gifted litterateur.
However, the latter was aware of the existence of the
former, who, on ene occasion, sought and received
assistance from the bright son of genius, who was wont
to remark in reference to his namesake: ’’Tnere are
two Clarkes in Australia both Ohristian-named Marcus,
but the one is a Christian, and the other a Roman
(Rum-’un).”
One of the priests at St. Mary’s plays cards.
Some little time ago, the anointed Adonis of Wt. Mary’s
was enjoying his customary Snndav evening “ relaxa-
tion’’ in a well-known house in Woolloomooleo, and
was justlat the liveliest part of the game when a Sunday
school boy, who had been watching the sport from a
street window, yelled out: “ Trump it, - ——I” The
rev gentleman whose name was called started at once
on a sick call as though he’d heard the last trumpet.
"When Parnell saw the Police agitation in
Dublin was at its height, and knowing that the Land
Deague was relying upon the disorganisation of the
civil power for a general rising, ho quietly loft. He
appears to have quite a genius for quietly leaving. Mr.
Sexton was taken suddenly lill, and Mr, Dillon was
looking after the Freeman in London, where there is a
branch office. There isn’t much of the stormy ipetrel
about Mr. Parnell. He resembles more the dove—the
dove which has mislaid the olive-branch.
In April, 1881, there died near Paris an indi-
vidual known as Count Ldon. Ho wag the natural son
of the first Napoleon, born in 1805; his mother being a
voung lady of considerable beauty attached to the
Court of the Queen of Naples (Napoleon’s sister). Her
maiden name wae Ei<5onore, and the “15om” in that
name as well as in Napoleon, furnished the Count,
otherwise “ Charles L5on,” with his surname. He was
moody and eccentric by nature, and died obscurely,
leaving a wife and family. Few knew his lineage.
A strange coincidence in divergence is to be
fennd in the names of one of the new peers and of hie
areat predecessor, the “Iron Duke.” The Dnke of
Wellington entered the army as Arthur Wesley—a
relative of John and Charles, who fought in widely
different fields—the Wellesley came in with the success
of his treat brother, the Viceroy of India; and an
ancestor of Lord Wolseley was his great-great-grand
uncle. Colonel Wolsey, who fought at the Boyne, and
gained the battle of Newtown-Bnller.
B O Holtermann has a good thing on at Braid-
wood He la about to work, with the latest and best
appliances, a mine which will be known as “ Bolter-
mann’s Molongo claim.” Tan head of stamp*
will bo erected shortly, and great result* are
expected from the reef, which is of tremendous width,
though poor, according to N.S.W. and Queensland
notions. " I’ve given it my name, ’ said B.O., the
other day. “ and I never give my name to a bad thing,”
And by the way, when, not very long ago, the once
nnlnbrated Holtormann’a claim was sold for £150, Mr.
Holtermann held in it no less than £9000 fully paid-up
shares Helstuokjte the old min* to the very last, and
thus justified the confidence reposed in him by those
whe took shares when the property was floated.
Prince Alexandre de Wagram, who has just

the little chapel of Chaillot. where the Barriage took
nlaoe At that ceremony, she wore white silk and tulle,
and no jewels, but her missal was richly dight with
aold and gems, and bore the Wagram coronet. She was
varv anxious to satisfy her husband before taking his
name that she had utterly renounced the religion of her
fathers and when she walked up the church to the
weddingjmareb, her features bore clear traces of the
religious emotions and exercises to which she had been
subject up to the last moment. Wa hope Berth® will
L a good wife; but why the daughter of a Rothschild,
19 vears old, with a fresh young face,and £120,000 a year
of her own, should take all that trouble to change her
religion in order to get married, is one of those awful
and unguessable that lovely woman so often gives ns.
The Earl of Harrowby is dead. This recalls to
our mind that not long ago a gentleman on a walking
tour was passing through Staffordshire, when, nearing
the village of Sandon (where the family seat of the
House of Harrowby is), he was given a lift by a local
gardener. By way of entertaining his driver, the
gentleman opened the conversation on what he con-
«idared to be an interesting topic, saying, “ Well,
they’ve got old Arabi at last and put him in gaol.” At
this the man dropped his reins, and began to bellow.
“ Whatl ” said ho ; “ put old Harrowby in gaol at his
time of life, and him suoh a good landlord, too—I won’t
believe it ” We don’t know how it ended. Oh, and
many years ago the “ Old Iron Dnke ” was reported to
have said that Miss Burdett-Coutts was “fit to be a
duchess,” and it was popularly received as a fashionable
tip that she would be Duchess of Wellington. How-
ever, grand old Arthur Wellesley (paasid away in 1852,
and then all eyes turned on the evangelical and obsequi-
ous Earl of Harrowby. Now, however, the owner of
jEI3 000,000 is bound in holy wedlock, as .Lady Ahnmtad
Bartlett Bnrdett-Coutts or something, and old Harroby
is in Heaven. Wbat ravages arc committed in tne
whirligig of time!
Italics ours. Thus the (E C.) Eipruss of 25th
jt ot ._•• We are glad to see and welcome the return of
Mr J Henniker Heaton to the city where his interests
are" so largely identified. Mr. Heaton is a spirited and
liberal-minded colonist whose presence is an acquisition to a
community. It is to this gentleman the colony owes the
munificent undertaking of collecting and publishing at
his own cost the writings and speeches of the late gifted
and ill-fated Daniel H, Deniehy. With a princely gene.
rosity, all his own, Mr. Heaton intends devoting the
entire proceeds of the work when completed to the
erection of a fair and enduring memorial to the outraged
memory of onr lost genius, and to the relief of those
members of his family who may be m wed.
It is unnecessary to add that opr heat and
warmest wishes are with an undertaking whose
success should be dew to Australian hearts. _
The cations part of ail this is that the spmted-
(O ghost of Walter Cooper I) and “liberal
minded” (speak, O Tom Robertson, and bear witness,
O Town-hall picture 1) Henniker has not so far returned
to Sydney at all. He is understood to be somewhere m
the vicinity of Melbourne, preparing in solitude, no
doubt, (1) a gigantic scheme for the federation of the
universe and the conferment of an earldom or a C.M.Q.-
ship on Henniker Heaton, and (2) an address to the hole-
and-oorner constituency for which the priests
want to run him thia election. I£ tho erection
of a “ fair and enduring memorial to the
memory of our lost genius” be taken in band by
Henniker, it will be a frost. There are a lot of people
in this colony who perfectly understand what Hen-
niker's " princely generosity, all his own,” means.
Mr. William Whitely, the London “Universal
Provider,” has, so a cable in the dailies tell us,
had his buildings burned down, and the damage
is assessed at £100,000—which, by the way, must
be a hundred thousand or two beneath tho mark.
William Whitely, like Jefferson Brick, “is one of the
most remarkable men in the country, sir." He com-
menced business in a small draper’s shop in Westbourne
Grove, Bayswater—a popular and highly respectable,
but by no means fashionable, thoroughfare in the south-
western district of London, Westbourne Grove is to
London what Oxford-street is to Sydney—but it is
hardly needful to state that the Grove is architecturally
more ornate, and that no fatal steam motor puffs deso-
lation through it. Whitely first made his money by
refusing to ring in “old stock” on his customers, and
by selling, for cash always, at the lowest figure that
would allow of a margin for profit. He lived frugally,
and married a lady who was an adept at " the millinery.”
A second shop for hats, bonnets, and mantles was soon
tho result—we m«au, of course, of living frugally, not
of getting mamcd. Then a third for tailoring—in which
he made trousers to order for 13s., coats for 25s., and
waistcoats for j ust nothing at all. Scared at this, the
tailor in the row fled; whereupon Whitely took his
shop, and turned it into a boot emporium. Then he
started a butcher’s shop further up, and a coal office
opposite. All these places were hignly profitable, and
Whitely began to be talked about. Then he began to
build, and improve, and amalgamate. He had a lunch-
room for ladies, and elaborate retiring rooms as well.
Whitely has had a lot of imitators, and a great many
have surpassed him in the universal providing lino. The
biggest emporium of this class in London now is
Sohoolbred’s, in Tottenham Court Road. The house,
however, that is exclusively patronised by the crime de
la crime is Howell and James’s. There they forget the
addresses of Duchesses, and take a thousand pouad
order as quite an every-day occurrence. There are
picture galleries here of incredible value, and all tho
wares, whether drapery, bijouterie, or brio-a-brao, are
all arranged for display by consummate artists. No
possible idea can be formed of the delightfully artistic
arrangement of the shops of London by a contempla-
tion of even the highest-toned of our Sydney em-
poriums. What Anthony Hordern’s is to Sydney, so
was Whitely’s to London. Or more so. But then,
Anthony Hordern’s is but in its infancy. They are
going—we are told—to sell beef there soon. Ton can

Thady O'Kan*, the veteran journalist of Charters
Tower*, ha* just scalped another foe, and whoops over
a verdict which is tantamount to a win. The last few
issues to hand of the Northern Miner just “ bile
right over ” with the innocent merriment of a virtuon*
victory, A lew ladlofuls will set our readers au fait
with the fuu Thady has been having. la giving the
Supreme Court list, he announced that tho case of
Blank v. Kane wasn’t coming on for trial. Blank having
given no notice of trial; further, that Blank " will
probably bo in the Church before the next sittings of
the court, as we observe he comes out as a ‘ Curate ’ in
a late number of the Tewers Herald. He may be a
blshep jet, but not a Holy Roman one, as there is a
trifle of a difficulty ia the way. Wo are anxious to
knew where he reoeived orders as a ’ Curate,’ and who
•imposed hands’ on him. It is generally the other way
with him. Anyhow, he is in some Church, and, as a
dignitary of a Christian community, it will not become
his newly acquired and hely honours to go after a com-
mou * B newspaper fellow ’ in a libel action. He had
bettor go fishing like St. Peter—there are plenty
gudgeon waiting te be hauled in. When to sacerdotal
unotnousness and holy cunning we add the legal astute-
ness, the vulpine stratagem and wily recourses of years,
a model ‘Curate’ mutt be the result, and happy will that
Church be which secures his services.” Next Thady
informed his friends that he was leaving “ for Towns-
villa to windup that old row with John Deane. We
doa’t think,” he says, “that John Deaae has much
stomach for such a stale old game, but his bottle-holder,
Morgan, eggs him on. Morgan’s money is on the fight,
and he’collars the plunder’if the big man wins. . . .
Meantime, make your bets, boys. We ask the prayers
of the Faithful • to deliver u* from evil.’" Apparently,
the “prayers of the Faithful’’ availed mush, for Thady
got a verdict against him of only a farthing, and the
Judge directed costs, not upon Supreme Court soale,
but upon District Court rates, and as if the case had
been triad in the Charters Towers District Court instead
of at Townsville. Then comes the p**an of victory in
the Miner. Deane is represented as standing “ before
this hardened jury in the dread majesty of all his blush-
ing honours—practical engineer, justice of the peace,
magistrate of tho territory, chairman of tho Divisional
Board, and alderman of the Council of Charters Towers,
but they considered one farthing ample plaister to heal
the gaping wound in his precious reputation. Morgan
wept copiously when he heard the verdict, bit all his
nails off to the stump, and his prayers for the jury went
up softly on high. Deane nimself, after listening in a
wrapt attitude to the fatal words of the foreman, ‘ On*
farthing,’ threw up his arms, and fell back on his seat
an elepnantine mass of broken and ruined majesty.”
An episode of the trial is thus described“ Judge
Paul’s aense of humour is very keen. The way in which
ha looked at poor Deane in the box and tenderly asked
him how long he had suffered ‘ uneasiness * from the
Northern Miner attache was something very piquant
His judicial gravity was severely tried by the painful
contrast before him—a broad-faced, full-blooded,
p ethorio, voluminous and rubicund aldermanie poten-
tate, and the suffering, broken and blighted being a*
depleted by his counsel.” These delicious tit bits were
published after the trial, and before the question of
costs had been decided. William Pritchard Morgan
couldn’t keep his hair on; he brought tho articles
under the Judge’s notice, and asked his Honor if they
were not in contempt of court. Judge Paul said they
were not, and, according to Thady " would stand none
of his bonnoe, and ‘ sat * on Morgan until he flattened
him out as flat as a pancake.” Then Thady tells “ how
the farthing was paid.” He inserted in xhe
Townsville Bulletin this advertisement“ Wanted, a
farthing, to pay John Deane’s verdict. A shilling will
be given for the coin. Apply, to-day, at the Exchange
Hotel, to T. O'Kane,” He was rushed at with farthings,
until ha “ mustered as many as would erect a statue to
John Deane.” Ha has “ kept a sackful of farthings for
future libel actions. The original farthing," continues
the irrepressible Thady, " was duly presented on Mon-
'day at Un o'clock in tie Townsville Ceurt-house, Mr.
Marsland, the defendant’s solicitor, wrote a proper
official letter enclosing the farthing, and this letter Mr.
Eutebias Blackall, the crier of the Court, presented
with preternatural solemnity to Morgan, the plaintiffs
solicitor. The barristers and solicitors present in
Court, the reporters, and many others, were cognisant
of the nature of the presentation and of the torpedo in
the letter. Morgan took the document, and, with a
look round at the expectant faces as much as to say
• I’m not to be had,* opened the letter, ;.nd when hi*
eyes lighted on that farthing, be turned livid and green.
The Bar, superior and interior, smiled broadly, and w*
fancy the Judge himself got an inkling of the joke."
Then he offers to publish Deane’s bill of costs graft*,
for “ the fuu of seeing all the 13*. 4d. booked against
Deane,” and winds up by defying all Boy cotters or
political partisans. Hooroo 1 And the very latest is
that Morgan has got a verdict for £150 against tho old
warrior.

A LETTER FROM CHARLES BRIGHT.
Dear Btjlletct,—Through the agency of a genial
friend, Mr. 8. P. Putnam, formerly a Unitarian
Minister, but of late years a popular writer and speaker
in the Liberal camp, I bad received an invitation to
spend a day with the redoubtable Free Thinker,
Colonel Ingersoll. at his summer residence, Long
Beach Accordingly, on the morning of Tuesday,
Bept. 19, Putnam and I mounted the elevated railway in
this great city of New Tork, where I am at present
located, transferred ourselves thence to the Long
Island ferry boat, and at Long Island City took the
ears, whieh about noonset us down at the pretty seaside
resort known as Long Branch. After a promenade of
nearly half a mile under the verandah of the gigantic
hotel, we came in sight of the pleasant detached
cottage, where the latest exposer of the " Mistakes of
Moses " hangs out. He was standing on the balcony,
and my first view of him was similar to that which the
Jewish Qod vouchsafed his lawgiver when the latter
was perched in the cleft of a rook. Ingersoll, how-
over, soon shewed that there were no religion* difficul-
ties in the way of his permitting the light of his count-
enance te shine upon his friends; and it would be sad if
there were, for it is an open, ingenuous, honest counte-
nance to look upon. No need to describe it, or him, as
the photographers have made his face and figure a
familiar object throughout the world.
Nearly all through the hot summer he had been com-
pelled to spend five days each week in Washington as
leading counsel for the defence in the important trial
known as the Star Route Case, and now was enjoying a
well earned oltum cum or sine dignitate in his beloved
family circle. And apropos of this, I have rarely entered
a house where love seemed to be so completely the
prevailing element. Ha, his wife, and two handsome
and accomplished daughters, appear to be united not
merely by blood, hut by complete community of senti-
ment. Besides those named, the home circle embraced
his wife’s younger sister, Mr*. Farrell, her hnsband, C.
P. Farrell (the publisher of Ingersoll’* well-known
volumes), and their sprightly little daughter, a child of
eight or nine years, who called Ingersoll her “dear old
Hunky,’’ and shouted with delight to see him dec orated
with her little straw hat and feather, whieh she had
popped on his head.
Ingersoll's earliest reception of Putnam and myself
was to put ns both into bathing dresses, and send us to
wash off the dust of the city in the sanny ocean. Then
a splendid luncheon and talk, which constituted a
worthy sauce to the edibles. The conversation ef the
brilliant iconoclast is, like his published works, notable
rather for qnaintnesn and inoisivenes* than for depth er
subtlety. To a certain distance his insight is keen and
clear as crystal, but his sphere of observation as a re-
former by no means comprehends all the varied com*
plexltiee and needs of modern social reorganisation.
At luncheon, and afterwards, when enjoying a fra-
grant cigar, he uttered many sentences worthy of re-
cord. Speaking of the absurdity of our presuming to
know anything about Qod, he said, •• If we went to
Heaven, and were introduced to a Qod, we shouldn’t
know if it was genuine or not. It might be a pmt-np
affair. We have no means of judging." "The vulgar
habit of swearing,” he observed, " had been of the
greatest use to the world. It had overthrown the
priestly monopoly." As we were referring to the char-
aotaristies of the different sects, he remarked, " The
Qod of the Unitarians is a respectable gentleman, who
has graduated at Harvard or Oxford, and considers an
error in grammar as the unpardonable sin." The reli-
gion he wished te see in the world was, he affirmed,
“ the simple religion ef kindness to each other." Of all
poetry, ever penned, those four lines of Robert Burns,
contained, in his opinion, the oompletest wisdom
“ To make a happy fireside clime
For weans and wif« —
That’s the true pathos and sublime
Of human life."
On the whole, I think I never heard talk which would
better repay a liberal-minded Boswell than that of In.
geraoll. Bat Boswellising is not much in my line, and
so these are the only specimens my memory will allow
me to present.
In conclusion, I would say that lagersoll’s marked
success as a lecturer, whenever he pleases profitably to
recreate himself in that direction, which, unfortunately,
is not often, seems to me to arias mainly from the fast
that be precisely hits the current popular taste. Theo-
logically, the average populace is prepared to enjoy any
amount of satire and ridicule which may be meted out
to them. Socially, they are more conservative. Inger-
coll does not find himself impelled to instruct them in
the latest developments of sociology or ethics, while he
lashes the old religions superstitions te their entire sa-
tisfaction. Moreover, his power of facial expression is
remarkable, and I can easily credit that, when on the
platform, he can turn it to good account either iu
comedy or pathos. To my thinking, he is doing in his
occasional oratorical raids a most valuable work, which
will galu for his name the benedictions of posterity.

Well, we have seen Sheridan once again. Our
impressions regarding his performance are mixed. We
were not surprised; we were not d isappointed. We like
his conception of the character of Shylock, because we
behave it was Shakespeare's conception. Bat though
the idea is noble, the embodiment given is only good.
This is the straight fact. We consider that Mr
Shendan began on too high a key. His action in the
first act seemed to ns a trifle too emphatic for the ocoa-
fcl° j* . , '"stead of letting the torrent of his rage run
mad, he had repressed it, showing at the same time that
it was only waiting an opportunity to burst out, we
think ho would have rendered the text quite as well
and have shown a greater grasp of his art. Wo believe
it is generally admitted that in tragic performances the
interest should rise gradually to the climax. How-
£7 er > wa don’t much care if it isn't. We have seen Mr.
Sheridan in ‘‘Lear," and we have seen him in “ Riche-
lieu. In either of these parts we consider he was
more successful than in the part of Shylock. Be it
remembered, we are judging him by himself—a high
standard. Compared with others we have seen, he is a
fine Shylock — compared with what he can do in
more congenial roles, he is only a good one. But the
audience were enthusiastic, if we wero not; and we
dare say Mr. Sheridan prefers the applause of the pay-
box to ours.
• • •
Though there was a good attendance on Satur-
day night, we felt that, somehow or other, there was
more room in the theatre than usual. We felt comfort-
able, not to say solitary. Wo did not discover the
cause of this new and mysterious sensation until we
grasped our glasses and settled down to scrntinise the
audience. Ther it burst upon ns like a thunderclap—
there were only three Hebrews in the house. We looked
at them attentively. They were evidently notjos much at
ease as nsnsl, and, when Syhlook came out, there was a
too painfully apparent straggle among them to hide
their noses. We don’t think they enjoyed the play.

Portia waa a pretty creature in her day, no
doubt, but Louise is justlovaly. She is best as the
lawyer from Padua; in fact, if the other “limbs of the
law were only as she is, we would wish the law was a
centipede. Her speech before the Dike was sweetly
and plainly delivered—barring, of course, a daar little
lisp, which we admire because it is altogether her own
Mws Emma Bronton was hardly vivacious enough for
Nenssa—otherwise her performasee was quite nice

Mr. G. B. Ireland Mr. Prank Cates
(Uratiano). Mr. Lachlan M‘G >wan (Launcelot Gobbo),
and Mr J. Q. Joyce (old Gobbo). These played
respectably—in fact, wo were thunderstruck at Mr.
Bainford’s Antonio. There was a vigour combined
with approximately correct pronunciation about his
speeches that was marvellous. Prank Catos, in his

From New Zealand, Maoullum writes us in a
joyous strain. His “Tambour Major” Company has
made a tremendous hit, and the Auckland mashers
assemble nightly ia battalions to applaud Fanny Lid-
diard, who has got all the boys as Griolet. Elsa May is
liked as Stella, and is quite happy, since no wicked N.Z.
scribe has had the audacity to call her a rainbow
Vernon’s Tambour-Major is said by the N.Z. Herald
to exceed, if anything, in cleverness, his impersonation
of Bunthome. Fred. Darke is the Dube, and Burt,

and the effect of Duncan’s apparition was marred by
the conduct of a low comedy “ boots " engaged as super,

their number Thomas Sayers. Esq., who recently caused

The Weekly Shroud, which makes “ thea-
trical criticism a special feature,” (I) is nothing if not
original, but very great when it is. It says :—“ The
Masootte has been going on all the week, with as much
success as ever, at the Theatre Eoval, and there seems
to be every probability that it will continue to go ©n
for au indefinite period. Mr. Woodfleld, as the impecu-
nious Dnke of Piombino, keeps the house in a con-
tlnnal roar of laughter while ho is on the stage." This
flattering notice would, doubtless, afford Mr. Wood-
field considerable gratification except for one trifling
particular. He doesn’t play the Duke of Piombino.
Perhaps, however, this was written by “one of the
humorous writers” of the paper in question. Bat
enough of these dull people, for we want to tell a
smiling universe that Ella Carrington's Stray Leaves
recently had “an ovation” at Blackall; and this inoi-
dent somehow suggests to us the item that Madame
Bernhardt is about to however, ask Damala.

Clara Stephenson has been singing La-di-dah in
Eockhampton, and the editor s«ys he “ could listen to
V a dozen times." That oan’o be the same man surely
who, when we were last there, used to use a rain’s horn
for an ear trumpet I Arthur Vivian is a great card
there too. He comes on in a velvet jacket, and sings
comic songs between the pieces. The editor doesn’t
say, though, he oould listen to Arthur a dozen times.

fias been a subject of remark there that with him
female beauty is invariably the cruet-cial test when
giving away the presents—the colonial suite being
nvariably awarded to some sweet colonial. [We
hardly feel this to be trenchant dramatic criticism of a
very high order. But, what would be the use of writ-
ing anything deep at this festive—not to say hilarious—
period ? 80, passans.—Ed. B ] And, talking of dioramas,
a poor fellow named Herbert Gray was found dead at
Saltern Creek, on the Aramac. In his pocket was a
letter which showed that he had once been lecturer to
the Zulu War. It is supposed that he peiished of
thirst; but it may be fairly surmised that his consti-
tution had been underminded by a continual contem-
plation of those awe-inspiring pictures. And this
brings us with a wild spring upon the fact that Madame
Bistori has commenced her Irish tour, and has been
received with the greatest enthusiasm at Dublin, but
her triumph as Que?n Elizabeth, at the Gaiety, in the

Mr. Jinkins in " Martin Chuzzlewit") has committed
himself with a Countess; but the report—like the Bum s
election items—“ requires confirmation." What does
not require that, though, is that the Simonsens have

Mr. Irving Bishop, a remarkable “ mind-

to be able to tell you the number of any note in your

performance of that trick in Sydney. And equally in-
teresting will it be to learn that an amateur theatrical
club has been formed at Tumut, the hon. sec. of which
is a party by the name of Tompson. And who shall say
we don’t stick to the Pollards ! Let us say at once that
they are doing big biz. with “Madame Angot” in
Hobart. Let us say, too, that Professor Gilbert, who
lost his action with the Maryborough Chronicle, has
been delivering, there, his lecture on “Amativeness, '
to an audience of—gentlemen. Interesting, even after
this absorbing item, is the intelligence that D. H. Har-
kius (who made such a mess of “The Colonel" out
here) has been playing a six nights’ engagement at
Manchester. The papers there consider his Hamlet
“ rusty." Poor Harkins !

Those 'Frisco papers have got an awful
"knocker." They are no respecters of persons; ncr
have they the slightest veneration (we have it largely!
for even the most distinguished members of the per-

we invariably give them a eend-olf in the shape of a
little complimentary par , or even an small airy stanza
or two. Not so our Han Franciscan contemporaries.
Why, when only recently a troupe of splendid people
left for somewhere, the papers, instead of shedding a
tear over their departure, said that at last a man would
be able to push up to a free-lnnch counter, and that a
Public Thanksgiving ought to be held on account of the
disappearance from street corners of "lantern-jawed
bummers" and "mildewed mashers.” One journal
proposed to give the impressario who had carted fiom
the city so much Boscian ruobish a totti nonial in the
shape of a besom broom in miniature, to be forwarded
by next steamer to Madagascar—or wherever they were
playing. They wrote, too, that on the day of departure,
the principal low comedian hid in the funnel, because
he owed 34 dollars for hash; and that the tenor gave the
stokers a quarter to cover him over in the starboard
coal-bunker, because he had heard that the boarder
whose new hat he had taken by mistake for his own was
coming down to the steamer with double-soled boots

sang a local comic song, composed, we should thing, by

two lines of aria and about twenty-seven of chorus.

ther.i was no reason. The lady. Miss Lillie Linden,
wao presides at the harp, is pale, but composed. She
dors not show any red stockings. She is right. We

When the sunrise through the window
Shot a sadden golden gleam.
Just this very sunny morning,
We were dreaming suoh a dream!
Eyes she had —hut, ah, no matter:
Lips she had like—never mind ;
And we thought it was the sunrise
When her gold hair round us twined.
Ah ! we said, she is an angel
Par too fair for us to hu»,
When, by thunder, we awoke to
Find a beastly water-jug
Eight above our heads suspended
In a hand—we’ll call it white.
And a voice—our Jenny’s—calling
“ Eise, you lazy wretch, and write!”


PEPPER AND SALT.
They’re fighting a great many duels in France,
rr.d, what is more surprising, hurting themselves. The
newspaper men appear to be having the fuu entirely to
themselves. Two unskilful swordsmen spitted one
another, the other day, and were subsequently buried;
while the whole staff of the Citoten challenged the
entire personnel of the Eappel. If the Wef.ki.t Shroud
goes on chaffing us like this, wo shall have to challenge
them or something. The ammunition would, however,
for obvious reasons, have to be saveloys. We would
have the satisfaction of throwing something into them
if we took nothing ont of theta, poor things I And all
this reminds us that Madame Maro da Montifaud, the
authoress of a few novels which are of rather a giddy
description, sent a challenge to <M. Francis Magnard,
of the Figaro. M. M. declined. He possibly thought
ha would be at a disadvantage fighting with a woman.
There is so little real about them now-adays.

Archbishop Vaughan has now on hire a nnmber
of seats in the Honse of God. In other words, his
Grace has intimated that the benches in St. Mary s
will in future be let out at various prices. Naturally
ho has been much abused by the organs of other denomi-
nations for this act. We don’t blame him, however.
Our opinion is that if religion—as it is generally under-
stood—is worth anything it is worth being paid for. If
it is not worth anything, the correct thing is to charge
accordingly. We have never come across a religion
that was not worth anything.

The Melbourne people are extremely busy just
now; busy crawling. When, we wendar, shall we get a
real live baronet of our own soil to grovel to P Doesn’t
the Queen like ns, or are not any of our squatters rich
enough to buy the title f We want a baronet, we do.
We are tired of prostrating ourselves before Farkes,
cringing to Davies, and admiring Abigail;—though,
with regard to the latter, he can clearly be classed
amongst the uppers. But wo require something tan-
gible. Why can’t they make E.B. a baronet, or, better
still, Joe Eckford a duke ? Wo could worship Joe, it he
were a duke, Whurroo I wouldn’t the hotel tucker go
high then I And, besides, there would always be grace
before meat, without the trouble of saying it.

The D.T. informed us, the other day, that Mr.
W. J. Clarke, of Melbourne, had been made a Baron,
and condemned, in a sub-leader, the policy of creating
a colonial order of the peerage III Asa matter of fact,
however, Mr. Clarke, as is now well known, has been
created a baronet. This is, it must be allowed, a take-
down for ns; since no New South Welshman has bean
allowed to buy a baronetcy since Sir Daniel Cooper
purchased his—cheap, £2500 cash down being the figure.
Sir W. J. Clarke gave £10,000 to the Indian Famine
Belief Fund in return for which he has had (say £50,000
worth of gratuitous ads. Sir Samuel Wilson gave
£30,000 to build a University Hall in Melbourne,
brought down on his head unlimited “guiver” by
presuming to occupy Hoghenden Manor for the benefit
of a few fugitive members of the aristocracy: yet he
ean’t compass the honour. Neither can Henniker
Heaton, who promised £1000 to the discoverer of
the Leichhardt \ relics ; nor [can the philanthropic
gentleman who said he would endow Dowie with a
Sydney Tabernacle. “Garden Honey” has a claim to
be distinguished by his Sovereign, if only by reason of
his street-corner eloquence, yet there are no present
signs of his ever being made a C M.Q. I In Mr. Eoseby
we have a true and acknowledged Coffee Palace philan-
thropist, an intrepid horseman, and a brilliant scholar;
yet he is left out in the cold Baronetcies like kissing,
seem to go by favour. We are sorr for this, because
if such a distinction were conferred npon ns, the honour
would be very popular down our court. But we hardly
see the use of trying for it, now so many good and elo-
quent men are passed over. We shall, therefore, put
off our presentation to the City Council of a Bindley
Murray and a spittoon until we get a hint of something
definite from the new Ministry. We love our country,
and all that, hut-hang it, you know I

Another effort is being made by Bignell, the
proprietor of the London Argyle Rooms, to get a license
for the place—the annual profit of which, when in full
swing, was £20,000 a year. The place was a casino of
the most depraved and most luxurious kind, and ws B
exclusively frequented by the demi-monde and their
entourage. Yet, annually, a cloud of policemen used to
swear that the ladies frequenting the place were as pure
as driven snow, and a magistrate came regularly forward
and deposed that he often took his daughters there to
enable them to indulge in Terpsiohorean exercises. But
the public got wild at this farce, and they made the
magistrates shut the place up. The police would have
kept it open for ever. We remember hearing a police
man swear in the Supreme Court somewhere that he
could detect nothing wrong ‘'to his knowledge” in an
orgie. That policeman is doing very well now, indeed.
They ssy he has property and land, and we don’t doubt
it. Short-sighted people seem to have all the luek ef it
just now.'. Look at Fawcett, the Postmaster-General of
Great Britain, and George Reid, and Bob Lowe (who is
now Lord Something), and others. See how they have
got on. Tes; it pays better only to see a little and
think a lot. We invite the attention of intending con-
stables to this little par.

It is proposed by the London Eock “that
clergymen incommoded at the baptism of sick or re-
fractory infants should be relieved by having at hand a
convenient receptacle, something in the nature of a
small fixed cradle, to place the child in during the
ceremony.” This suggestion Is ingenious, if not prao
tioal. Few men can hold a quiet baby without making
it awaken every echo in the neighbourhood, much leas a
refractory one. We have tried holding babies all ways.
Sideways, backways, upside-down, and downside-up;
hut they have always howled. And we have had a large
experience, having kissed more infants for their own
sakes, and for the sakes of their nurses, than anyone
outside of Salt Lake City. Well, fancy a young un.
married curate, fresh, perhaps, from wine-parties and
the Oxford eight, having a baby put into his hands for
the first time, and knowing that he has to christen it
under a battery of critical eyes, while he has only a dim
notion of the service, and a dimmer one still of holding
the infant. The denouement quickly comes. Theparscn
stutters, the baby yells, the mother sniffs, and “ father *
(who has been “keeping it up” with a few friends a
the pub. in honour of the ceremony), bursts into a
of rum-inspired laughter. The Eock evidently has

At a preliminary meeting of R. B. Smith’s, at

remembering the several miniiterial scandals that were
in the courts, he said, loud enough for all to hear him :
‘Yts she is, you old duffer; you have got her hid
behind the organ, and yon want to go heme with her
yourself.’ The minister blushed and said the services
would close by singing the doxology.”
A man was out hoeing np North the other day.
He was baiefcot. Suddenly bo saw what ho took to be

up his hoe and smote at it with a mighty streke. He
cut his own big toe off very neatly. Internal evidence
might suggest that this nnfortunate was the local
editor, more especially as be is the boss snake-seer of
the district. But further consideration shows the
fallibilty of such a conclusion. If he were the local
editor, he would have taken the toe home and eaten it,
after making a paragraph accusing the poundkeeper of
the mistake.
A lovely lot of single girls have arrived in
Eookhampton by the Selkirkshire. During the voyage

manacled. A number of them are described as being

to have been invited into the saloon to play npon the

shire was not "an admirer of f*male beauty.” Miss
O'Brien, though, sang all the time. Her vocal efforts,
it is alleged by the passengers, were of an jnnraportable

It is interesting to learn that, apropos of the
case of Dunn, the woman-griller, the B.o. hierarchical
organ, the Express, “totally disbelieves in thedoo.
trine of capital punishment as a preventative (sic) to

their belief in eternal burning in hell-fire as a preven-
tive of crime. But if gentlemen cf Mr. Dunn's
olaee won't refrain from grilling people right in faee of
the alleged fact that arson accompanied by murder is a
ciime tor which they’re liable to be hanged in thia
world and toasted in the next for a term beside which
ten thousand billion oentnries would be not even as a

He must have been very hungry, that E. T. Smith, to
have eaten a tobacconist. Still, it’s be'ter to cat a
obacoonist than an alderman. We mean better for yon.
A Temperance lecturer at Grafton the other day,
07 way of an “ illustratin'!,’’ said that a number of our
foremost poblio men died from drink, and mentioned
t he names of a late popular poet and a recently deceaied
journalist. ('here was once a water-sponter who
lectured at Kmsas City, and being carried away with
his subject delivered himself of something similar.

proposed Parkes as a flt and proper person to represent

North Shore bridge had been given. We see also that
the B M.S. “ Rosett'c,” (sic) is expected to arrive
shortly, and that “ H.M. Qnaid" (sic) was present at
the cricketers’ banquet. Against all this, however, we
must fairly admit that the Melbourne names are invari-
ably printed correctly 1

Recently, in Paris, a journalist named Godard
got the “sack" from the Citoten, when he mustered
hie friends, carried the Citoten office by storm, and,
shutting up all the staff, unlooked the formes, and
inserted a long and higbly-ooraplimentery article about
himself. They then waited until the paper was printed,
carried off a hundred copies, and then went whooping
away, singing the “ Marseillaise ’’ It wouldn’t be a
bad lark if a crowd of wags were to invade tbe Bum
office, and put in something antagonistic to John Davies
The parties wouldn’t have to wait long while the paper
was being printed, anyhow!

Mr. D. B. W. Sladen, whose remarkable efforts
in the poetic line we reviewed seme weeks ago, has been
mpeted Professor of English Literature and Belles.
Liftresin the University of Sydney. We heartily Con-
gratula‘8 Alma Mater upon the selection. That such a
splendid genius and brilliant bard ae Mr Sladtn should
not be lost to Sydney is a matter for the country to be
jubilant about. Wa are very sanguine—looking at Mr.
Bladen's published works—of his success with the
students. We are sanguine, because we are sure that
the new professor will t u ach his scholars a great deal
more than he has learned himself.
The London illustrated papers are certainly to
be congratulated on the imaginative powers of their
artists. Seme of the pictures represent the cavalry
engaged in spitting Egypflans three at a time, bat these
pictures are surpassed by those ic which the infantry
are represented as bayoneting theioo. The bayonet baa
always gene in right in the middle of the stomach, and,
presumably, eat at, the back. Every bayonet has an
Egyptian on it, and tome have two. The Egyptians in
the picture ara net making the smallest attempt at
defence. Their eyes fro rolled up and their fezss are
falling off. and they evidently don't, like cold bayonet
for breakfast.
There are two Germans in Queensland who
publish a paper called the Zeitung The Minister for
Lands, speaking of them and their paper, in the Queens-
land Assembly, made the ioooae remark that “If the
statements made were published ia the English language
the pair of scoundrels who professed ta be the owners
or proprietors of it would be flogged or shot about once
a week." We thoroughly agree with thi? benevolent
old gentleman. Any foreigner who attempts to provide
reading matter for the enlightened colonists of this
country should be shot oat of hand. We except, of
eonsse, tho Tribune staff, which, we believe, is exclu-
sively composed of Tierra-del Fnegans, but, as that
journal is only intended for the dead, it doesn’t matter.
Certain Chicago physicians experimented with
electricity on a hanged man lately. They succeeded in
restoring the rhythmic motion of the heart, and ex-
pressed the belief that if the neck bad not been broken,
they could have restored life. The papers over there
rais'd the question as to what would have been the
legal status of the criminal if he had been resuscitated
If snch a thing occurred in this country the solution of
the difficulty would not have required a moment’s con-
sideration. The rope would have been unhitched from
the criminal’s neck, and he would have been a
C.M.G. of at once. We've got no stupid old prejudices
in New Sooth Wales.
George R. Sima (“ Dagonet”) says he has tried

however, being the worst of all. He considers it bad t

Will, here in N.S.W., we have both wine (prouerly so
called) and beer; but we are not vary enthu-iastic on
the subject of either of them. There is too much body
in the former for us, and not enough in the latter.

Mr. Sims further states that the most powerful remedy
in the world for liver complaint is onions. We think
there is something in this; —for the horny-handed, who
devour onions in huge quantities, have never anything

outside skin, and wade in. It would be an economical

ANOTHER OF PARKES’ GHOSTS!
The Hemperor tries to “get at” the Civil Service.
Will he survive this Exposure?
Parkes, whenever he gets into a tight place, finis a ghost to help him out
of it. On Tuesday he found another spectre. He has never done anything
for the Civil Service. Had the heads of that service gone to him a few days
prior to the East Sydney election to represent the urgency of Civil Service
reform, their action would justly have been regarded as a threat. Sir
Henry, however, on Tuesday (with the hisses of the East Sydney electors
ringing in his ears) called together the heads of the Civil Service, and offered
them a bribe ! Head. At this most extraordinary interview—the more
extraordinary as taking place in the heat of an election contest —of a life or
death political struggle—Parkes convened the heads of the Service at his
office, and treated them to a lot of political marmalade. He was going, he
said, to give them promotion by merit, a Civil Service Bill to define their
position, and all sorts of other nice things. He explained that he had
convened tliom because of the receipt by him some time ayo of an anonymous letter
from a member of the Service ashing the intentions of the Government with regard
to Civil Service reform. The Herald's present editorial policy is right against
Parkes and Co. Yet it would really appear that some weak-kneed creature
on the Herald staff has been—ah —mesmerised by the Premier. This is how
the report is prefaced:—“A short time ago, it appeared, the Colonial
Secretary received an anonymous letter from some member of the Civil
Service, inquiring what the Government intended to do with regard to the
introduction ef a Bill for the regulation of the Civil Service and the
superannuation of the officers. Of course the Premier could take no notice of
an anonymous communication , hut he intimated that he would like to see some
of the public officers on the subject. It was in consequence of this that the
deputation had waited on him— not as having had any connection with the
anonymous letter., nor as representatives of the Civil servants, hut simply to hear
the views of the Premier upon the subject.” The italics are ours. How
the report of such a flagrant piece of impudence could have been allowed to
appear in the Herald columns without one word of editorial comment is a
perfect mystery to us. And now about this wonderful, mysterious, and
convenient “ anonymous letter.” How is it that no one ever heard a word
about it until now ? Does Parkes think he is dealing with fools ? Does he
imagine for an instant that the “ anonymous letter’ isn't regarded by all
who know him as being as mythical and apocryphal as the Kiama Ghost—
which also came in an anonymous letter ? This flimsy trick, immediately
following, as it does, the Government’s barefaced attempt to buy the votes
of the railway labourers by increasing their pay, should of itself he sufficient
to ensure the downfall of a politician who has been allowed to play the
dictator so long that ho has an absolute contempt for the electors, whom he
evidently regards as being of the mental calibre of drunken swine.
Mr. Charles Kahlo, U S. Consul for New
South Wales.
In this issue we give a portrait of theU.S. Consul,
Mr. Charles Kahlo, who succeeded the late Mr.
Mr. Williams here, about ten months ago. Mr.
Kahlo, previous to his arrival in this colony, was
engaged extensively in the manufacture of carriage
material, and was also a representative for the
State of Indiana in the State Legislature. Mr.
Kahlo, during his sojourn amongst us, has taken
a great interest in the colony, as most of our
resident Americans are doing, and, no doubt, his
visit to A merica, although of short duration, may
be the means of furthering the interests of this
colony, as well as those of the country he so Well
represents. [Photo, by Boyd. ]
Mr. Edmund Barton.
Me. Edmund Barton, whose portrait appears
in our eighth page, is a member of a well-known
literary family, ana was born at the Glebe, Sydney,
in 1849. He received his early education at the
Fort-street Model School; then he went to the
Sydney Grammar School, gained two scholarships
and the captaincy. In 1865 he matriculated at
Sydney University, where he won a special prize
as facile princeps in classics ; held the Lithgow
scholarship in his second, and the Cooper scholar-
ship in[hia third year, and graduated asB.A., with
first-class classical honours, in 1868. His M.A.
followed in 1870, and in December, 1871, he was
called to the Bar. In 1879 he was elected to re-
present the University in Parliament, defeating,
By a decisive majority, the present Minister for
Mines, Dr. Renwick, whom he again opposes at
the poll. In the following year Mr. Barton was
elected to the University Senate, of which he is
still a member. The University having been dis-
franchised, he was nominated and returned unop-
posed for Wellington. Mr. Barton denounces the
Lands Act Amendment Bill as a piece of “ tinker-
ing legislation,” calculated but to ensure a con-
tinuance of the corruption engendered by the
Acts on which it was founded, and has forcibly
drawn attention to the rapid growth of huge free-
hold estates. He made one of the beet speeches
heard in the Assembly in favour of the second
reading of the Public Instruction Act; but he
strongly condemns the wretched failure of the
present Government to administer the Act in
many important provisions, notably the strange
delay in the establishment of High Schools, and
he is fully alive to the injustice and floutings
which have disorganised the teaching staff of the
colony. Mr. Barton, who ia familiarly known as
“ Toby,” has debating powers of a high order,
and will, intellectually and socially, honourably
represent the first constituency ia the colony.
Mr. John M'Elhone
We give the portrait to-day of “ Jack” M'Elhonr.
No man is more wanted in the Assembly of this
country. In politics, he knows no friends, and fears
no foes. In Parliament he is a econrge and probably
no man ever elected to the House can lay claim to
more useful, honest work—from the attack on
the Yanko Reserve swindle down to the exposure
of the Bridge and Land t ings. M’Elhone is the
Macpherson and Dalgleish of onr Parliament.

The cat was spilt out of the bag most com-

The lunatic Cunningham was hanged at Gonlburn,
yesterday. Death was instantaneous. He passed a had
night, and did not sleep at all. He held the leg-irons
while the blacksmith struck them off, and when the
iron was cut pulled them off his legs. He held his arms
to be pinioned, and walked up the scaffold without any
assistance. He cursed the Queen in horrible terms,
hut said nothing more. No clergyman was present at
* he execution. The condemned man had written a
statement the day before, but when he found that no
clergyman attended, he asked for a match and burnt it.
The offence for which he was hanged was “ trying ” to
hill a warder. Dunn, who roasted a woman to death in
George-street, the other day. for the sake of five shie-
lings, has been reprieved. We bone that the banging
of a lunatic, who, as a matter of fact, tad done no
murder, is the end of the series ef horrible injustices

ME. JOHN M'ELHONE, CANDIDATE FOE FAST SYDNEY.


f | IQ THE ELECTOES OP EAST SYDNEY.
Gentlemen,—In this announcement of my Candida*
tore for one of the four Beats m the -Legislative
Assembly, to which it is yonr privilege to elect, I ex-
press, in the briefest manner, my views on the great
question of the day. The occasion of the present
election is of the gravest character, the Ministry of Sit
i? n 5v haying suffered defeat on the question,
"’hether the existing Land Laws shall, with slight ;.odi-
nianons and onoodification, be perpetuated, or whether
see laws relating to the alienation and occupation of the
public lauds shall be radically reformed and enacted on
an entirely new basis, and in aoocrJ with the present,
requirements and circumstances of the colony. 1 hold
that such radical change is necessary. Having had a
practical and intimate knowledge tor many years of the
working of the existing Land Laws, I am forced to the
conclusion that the law of "promiscuous selection be-
fore survey" baa proved a most injudicious one, has b:en
in many ways inimical to the best interests of the
colony, and has totally failei to settle a happy and
prosperous population on the in the interior of
New South Wales.
. views cn this all-important subject were expressed
in my letter published in the Stdni r Morning Herald
of September 25th last, and those views in a great
measure accord with the " Amendments” tabled in the
Legislative Assembly by Mr. Garrett, and with the pro-
positions of Mr. A Stuart.
Those views, briefly stated, are —
1. Prohibition of transfer of selection! (except in
oases of selector's death) until all conditions of selec-
tions have been fulfilled and all balan jes to G jvernment
paid up.
2 Cessation of all Pre-emptive letsas, Preemptive
Purchases, and of Auction Sales of Crown Lands more
than three miles from centre of towoship of 5-0 inhabi-
tants.
3. Subdivision of the colony into districts, c'ass ; floa-
tion and survey of large areas of land must suitable for
settlement in each district or natural zone.
4. The maximum area allowed to selector to vary
according to district or zone, from 610 to 8000 acres, at
prices ranging from 40s. to 10s. par acre, according to
position and quality of selection
5. As regards the waste lands not immediately re-
quired for sattl <ment, tue granting of secure tenure to
graziers on a just and reasonable rental, and on such
liberal conditions that temporarily secure from the
invasion of •• b ack mailers” they may properly im-
prove tin.if holdings, and may be able to pay a fair
rental.
My travels in Queensland and South Australis, where
the land legislation has been devised on the above
principles, have convinced me of the r superiority to
our boasted, but pernicious, system of general ‘‘free
selection befere survey,” which, however satisfactory
m its working for the first few years after 1861, has
resulted in reducing year after year the (proportionate
to population) areas cultivated ; in causing the aggre-
ss' ion of huge freehold estates; in setting class against
class in end'ess, costly litigation; in an immeasurable
amount of perjury and wrong-doing; in a general lower-
ing of the moral sense of the community, and above all
has failed in its intention to settle a race of yeomen
freeholders on the land.
As the advancement and pro?perity of the whole
colony are dependent on the just and equitable settle
ment of the Land Policy, and as this is the vital ques-
tion awaiting decision at this General Election, it is
imperative that no side issues be allowed to have weight
with the Etectoxs.
As an advocate of the ab.ve given views, I venture to
seek yonr suffrages; as, however, this is my first
appearance in the political arena, it is but right U.at I
express myself on the general sutjeots which have
agitated the country at previous elections, and which
may happen to be revived in the ensuing Parliament.
Chiefest cf these is the Educa ion Act. as regards
which f belong to the par-ty on whose banner is
inscribed the words. “NAIJONAL, COMPULSORY,
SECULAR, and FREE.”
Am an advocate for the extension of tailwaysand
public works, and for bringing the railway into the
heart of the city of Sydney.
In view of the necessity for large public and private
works, the extent cf our territory, and the paucity in
numbers of our population, I advocate the '• extension
of immigration.”
Am a free-trader by sincere conviction, both as re-
gards fiscal policy and as regards the now, I hope,
buried question of state-aid to religion. I with to
enter the House of Assembly tied to no party, but will,
mg to give fair and reasonablr support to any Ministry
which will properly admin-ater our lauds and fl ranees,
which will carry out needed pnb'io works, and which
wili initiate reforms m our iegi-lat on as lequircd.
Though by profession a sqaatter’s agent, I am a Now
South Welshman, anxious in every way to promote the
good of this colony and my fellow-oolonists ; and above
all I am an Australian anxious to break down the fl rti-
turns barriers which divide the colonies of the Austra-
ban group; and most anxious am I to do my mite
towards the peaceful settlement of countless millions
of laborious (and therefore happy) denizens on the rich
lands of Australia, whom task and privilege it shall be
to raise a powerful and imposing empire in this sunny
Southern land.

QJIO THE ELECTORS OP THE GWYDEE
Gentlemen, —I am thus early rc-seeking your votei
and suffrages, because Her Majesty’s Kepresentativ
has thought fit to dissolve Parliiment before it hat
completed two-thirds of its term, at the call of t
Ministry that sticks barnacle-like to the ship cf State
The immediate effect of this diplomacy is to keep ir
power the 'Joveinment for somemoH’hs longer, to carry
on its excessive alienation of our Crown Lands, and ‘c
continue the irritation that exists between certsii sec
Mods of onr rural population—a poll y most distinct' )y
condemned by the majority in Parliament, called to
getter under the auspicev of the present men.
I can only characterize such conduct »s moat nn.
statesmanlike, unconstitutional, and as showing con.
tempt for the late vote.
I was one of the few who elected Mr. Stuart leader
of the I'ppoiition. when it was agreed to oppose the
attempt to consolidste the old Land Act of 1861 and it«
amendments, inasmuch as after 21 years trial it, bad not
fu filled its early promise. It was also decided that
ind’sonmrna.te selection before survey had only en-
gendered bad blood, hid failed to settle a ce-.maary on
the toil, and bad caused fixity of tenure in the worst
possible shape, viz. :-Monopolyof the Lind for sp«cu
lative purposes. We approved ef reducing the deposits
on Conditional Purchases to 2s. per acre, but final
payment in 21 years.

TO THE ELECTORS OF THE ELECTORAL
OF CANTERBURY.
Gentlemen, — Two years ago you elected me at tl
head ot the poll as one of your representativei
I have endeavoured to the best of my ability i
advance the best interejts of the Electorate and of tl
Colony, and to carry out the principles which I the
enunciated to you ; and as I tru t and believe that I sti
retain your confidence, I venture to ask for vour vote
and influence at the present election.
You are aware of my exertions in c rnneoi ion with th
extension of the Railway into Sydney, and that I am
stanch upholder of the principles of the Education Ac
and of the Licensing Act, although some amendment
may be required in the details cf the latter Act.
I desire to tee at once introduced a Civil Service Bil
and a bill to provi le for Local Government,
lam not in favour of the Land Bill introduced by th
Government
On these and all other matters I hope to have th
pleasure to address you at the meetings which 1 eha
hold throughout the electorate.
I trust that jon will again plane me in the same pi om
position &8 at last election, and beg to remain
Youre respectfully, W. H, PIGOTT.
rjlO THE ELECTORS OP ST. LEONARDS.
Gentlemen, —By the recent dissolution of Parliament
yon are again called upon to exercise 3 our franchise in
electing a member, or ratber two members, to repre-
sent your electorate j and in the belief that the friends
wh) accorded me such generous support on former
occasions will still aland to their colours, I once more
have the honour to cffor myself as a candidate fer your
suffrages.
As you are aware, the chief question of the hour, and
on which the present election will probably binge, is
that much.vexed one*of our land laws, and I much fear
that many a pot theory and many an ambitious venture
will be doomed to defeat before such a measure will be
perfected as will satisfy all parties ; however, wo can
still express our opinions, and thus briifly I give you
mine ; I am in favour of fixity of tenure for the squatter
at an advance on the present rate of rental, the free
selector should bave such provision n ade in his interest,
and be subject to such conditions as would efb dually
protect and encourage the hona fide settler, while at the
same time the mere adventurer, whose business is to
trade on the energy and industry of his neighbour,
would find the field of operation for his contemptible
calling materially restricted. Free-stleotion should, I
think, follow, not precede, survey.
Thu Education question is, in my opinion, not one
that should be raised at the present juncture; but I
rrnysay that 1 still retain the same imprendon ns I
formed at its advent: that it will eventually conduce to
the great good of the people. I am not prepared to say
that the administration of the Education Act ha* been
ss judicious as it should have been; I incline to think
it has not, but cannot charge any disappointment aris-
ing frem want of direction to the principles of the Act
itself. Tht Education Act, as it stands at present, has
m y warn est approval.
The L.sensing Act has excited much comment. I do
not look on it as a perfect measure, and think it is
capable of amendment in many of its features ; yet, as a
whole. I deem it worthy of support. I cannot but think
its effect so far has been productive of a certain amount
of good, »nd, wht n subjected to a j udioious pruning, will
prove a very valuable and satisfactory law
That 1 am a staunch freetrader is probably already
known to a majority of you, and I therefor 1 need scarcely
revert to the fact.
I am in favour of immigration so long as the class of
immigrants is such as would bo beneficial to the eountiy,
but an indiscriminate introduction of the refuse from
other parts of the world will moot with my strongest
opposition.
Local matters may more properly be deferred until I
have the honour of adlr.-sait g )ou personally, but it
not unfreq-ently happens that very patriotic people
will say “ Ob, we don't approve of meiely local members
—give us the man who will study the general good of the
country,” 4o. Now, white I admire true patriotism, I
have great frith in the maxim that “Charity should
begin at home; ’ and I very much incline to think that
if a member will not honestly devote his attention to
the immediately wants of his own constituency, ihe
‘■ good of the couKirv " will te very little added to by
bis exertions. I hold that the first duty of a member
should be to waloh the interests • f his constituents.
This he can do without in any way failing in his duty to
the country. A just man at homo is a ju.t man to his
neighbour. Then, as to local requirements, I am cf
opinion that, amongst other necessities, the north and
south shores of Port Jackson should he connected
by a high level bridge Manly Beach should be
joined to North Shoie by a bridge over the Spit,
and connected with Sydney by tram or rail; similar
communiouion suould te effected between the city
aid ihe Mid-lie and tieoige’s Head foitiflcaiicns
via the high revel bridge, so that if ever necessity
a osj our forts could be manned and supplied without,
as at present, havirg to run under the very guns of an
Invading enemy. The estab ishment of Small Debts
Courts in your electorate I lock on as an urgent
necessity, and one that if eleotid I should give prompt
attention to. Provision should be made for a water
supply for 6t. Leonards ; ard I still tdhiro t« my often
ixprcssed conviction that the best soulce for this will
bei found in the Lone Cove River I am aware that it
has been recently statei in the Press that this matter
has been already takei-. in band ; so have many other
things, yet for want of urging them forward they have
b eu peimilled to s ioe gracefully into oblivion.
1 thins, gentlemen, I have stated sufficient to enable
you to forti your estimate cf my political treed. I am
known to moat of you, and it will remain for you to say
whether, from what y> u do know of my actions duiing
my Joog resioence amongst you, I ana entitled to the
confidence it. is necessary yen should have in the man
you honour by returning as your representative.
1 thiua i may claim, without being deemed egotisti-
cal, that for the past ten years I hive identified myself
with every movement having for its object the welfare
and advancement of the electorale, so far as my hnmble
ability would permit, and though my efforts may not
have been wholly successful, I can assure you I am
more prone to accept defeat as an incentive to renewed
efforts than throw up the sponge.
I shall take early opportunity of meeting you, person-
ally, when 1 shall be netter able to Jay my views before
you than can be done on paj er, and until then
I beg to remain,
Faithfully jours,
B. O. HULTEEMANN.

incompetency and lack of moral courage in its members.
The appointment if Government Inspectors to
scrutinize the Pdmsoll water-line; to pi event vessels
leav.ng ports over aden, or inau unseawonhy c'ndition.
and to toe that they are properly fitted with life-saving
appliances
nhe stoppage of assisted immigrttion.
The extension of the eight-hour system to Govern-

The Amendment ot the Licencing Act
The overthrow ot the pre ent Government.

XO THE ELEClOtfS OF THE HUN 1’EJbfc
£L£C i OBA.TE.
Gentlemen, —The defeat of the Government upon the
second leading of the Land Liil having resulted in a
Dissolution of Parliament, I have resolved to offer my-
self as a Candidate for y our self ragea. In appealing to
you for your support I may stare, that along with other
gentlemen in the Metropolis, I have, for the last two
years in particular, ascist-d in carrying on au agitation
for a r firm in eur Land Laws. W* were directly the
means of holding several public meetings, and appoint-
ing deputations to the Mini stir on the tub j»ct, conse-
quently it will be easily seen that 1 have already done
some service to the country at large on this question.
I aw in favour of putting a stop 10 the strife now
existu g between two valuable classes of producers now
settled on the soil in this country This only can be
done by having Agricultural and Pastoral Areas pro-
perly defiaid I axi also in favour of the Abolition of
Auction Boles, a principle that has worked an iuoaloul-
ao e amount of injury to the country, and mat has
laid tue foundation of a “Landed Anstocrany” not
equalled even in the old countiies of e.urope. Holding
tnese opinions, I aor opposed to the Government in
their attempt to continue and consolidate the evils
referred to, instead of reforming them.
I should not have opposed Mr Burns at this time,
"_ as ,f°r his support of the Government on this question.
Under these oircuun. tances, 1 think it only right, that
the people of the Hunter Electorate shall have an op-
portunity of expressing themselves on this important
question—which, after all, istheonly question properly
befora the country My opinions on other p -htical
questions will be fu’ly exp anted at the various mcjt-
logs I purpose holding, nnu on the Hustings. Regret-
ting the action of the Government in rush ng on the
Flection with such indecent histe, and wuiou v> lit
render it almost impossible fer mo to visit all parts of
your Electorate, I remain, yours truly.

A bard signing “ Sootish Australian ” sends us
some " Lines on Kendall, the Anstiilian poet.” He
commences fervidly with
“ Farewell, dear brother of the muse,"
and after lamenting that poor Henry has gene to ex-
plore the secrets of the " dark misterious (sic) cave,"
he cries—oh, and how pathetically ! —
" In vain shall the mnrmrring streamlets list (sic)
In tbe filenca of the calm dewey (sic) evening and
•mom; "
and finally he asks who, now that Kendall is no more,
shall
** Sing the beauties of the girgling rocky shore
And fertile valleys of our much expected land.”
In a charming note which accompanies this beautiful
effusion, the “ Sootish Anstrilian" hopes his poem will
be “ worthie ” of insertion; and. as he is “ ignorent of
how to adress such pices,” would like ns to inform him,
as he is anxious to “ correspond.” We do this with
pleasure. The most popular way of addressing is to
write our direction on an envelope, and pop it into the
post Some, however, prefer to send their copy along
by the waggon. We advise “Sootish Anstrilian” to
send his next stuff by a hearse—a very slow hearse.

“ Old Williams, the Australian pedestrian,
attempted to walk 130 miles in 26 hours, at De.tford,
England, September 8, and (ailed. He is 50 years of age,
and yet he w.lked 100 miles in 22h. 32m 53s. He walked
110 miles in 25h. 1m. and 2s. and left the track. Poor
old fellow ! „ ,
After the match against N.S.W. the English
Eleven play at Maitland, on Dec-mber 6 th and 7th.
Newcastle, on 8th and 9th, and at Tamworth, on 11th

railway passes to them.
A 100 yards footrace for .£50 between M.
Murphy, of Wollongong, and Dave Dunlop, of New-
castle, came off on Saturday week, at Wollongong,
before about 600 spectators. Dunlop was made the
faveurita at 5 to 4. He got the best of the start, but
Murphy caught him at thirty yards and eventually won,
after a fine race, by about a foot in 11J sec.
Melbourne gave the Australian cricketers a
hearty and well got-up welcome. Three cheers at the
Bailway Station, speech frem the vice-president of the
Cricketing Association. Three fonr-horse drags to
Town Hall, crowds cheering. Mayor receivad and con-
gratulated thorn. Three cheers for the Eleven again,
Murdoch returning thanks. Loyal toasts and cham-
pagne, then back to their hotel.
The Emu Plains cricketers played the South
Creek Club on Saturday last, and beat them easily. In
the Emu team there was a player by the name of E.
Fakir who made 41 runs and bowled ten wickets. The
selection committee ought to get this cricketer down
for some of our big matches. He bats and bowls quite
like Evans and extraordinarily like unto the tatter,
whojof course, was far away at the time.
The N.S.W. Rowing Association chartered the
steamer Glenelg to follow the ‘'Champagne on Saturday
The public wore admitted at five-bob apiece. The
steamer was kept at the Quay till the last moment to
gather in every stray *' kaiser; ” and before she
got right up the river into position, the race had started.
The steamer, turning, stuck in the mud long enough to
keep the passengers from seeing very little of thespin.
Somewhere up-country a billiard-marker prose-
cuted a professional runner for perjury. The defendant
was acquitted. The prosecutor got crumpled up >n
cross-examination, admitting all sorts of dreadful things
He even said he often told lies —which is an admission
we can never pardon. We suppose now the pedestrian
will prosecute the billiard-marker for something—libel,
perhaps, or malicious prosecution. The libel, of course,
would consist in calling him a professional pedestrian.
As we predicted, Layoook does not see his way
clear to row Bush on the Clarence. Bush is agreeable
to leave to the choice of his opponent aay water on the
Clarence Biver, allowing him to tlx a day when the City
of Grafton could be chartered for the purposes of
steamer-money. Bush is willing to row for from £-.00
upwards. Michael declares that should a match be not
now made forthwith, he will not entertain any farther
proposal from Elias.
Murdoch, in responding to the toast of the Aus-
tralian Eleven at the banquet last week said, “ l i the
Australian team there >a* the greatest harmony,
and they had but one wish—to win. and to uphold the
honour of Australian cricket.” WeTl talk about the
harmony av soon as we Had out how many of them are
on speaking’terms with each other. As for the‘‘honour
©f Australian cricket/* that was stilled in the Victorian
and N. 8. Wales matches.
The match between the English Eleven and the
Castlemaine Twenty-two resulted in a draw. Cistle-
maine's first innings closed for 136—Q. Smith 41, Dono-
van 12, Hyman 12, Vick 10. Morloy played, and obtained
8 wickets for 45 runs. The Eleven soared 238—C. T.
Studd 52, Q. B. Studd 45. Vernon [(not out) 32. Bates
33, Tyleoote 30, Barlow 21, Barnes 5, Bead 4, Steel 3,
Leslie 2; sundries 9. Castlemaine, in the second inn-
ings. lost 8 wickets for 22 runs, Morloy getting 4 wickets
for 15 runs, Barlow 2 for 2 runs, and Steel 2 for no runs.
On Sunday they proceeded to Sunbury, whore they
were entertained by the Hon—no, Sir W. J. Clarke.
That little bird tells us that the N.S.W. Cricket
Association telegraphed to the NSW. members of the
Australian Eleven to play in this week's match. The
amount of real patriotism about them can be judged by
their refusal to play. There are a good many points
about this team wnioh the public should know. As
soon as all the “fizz” has gone flat, we shall endeavour
to bring these arrogant athletes to their proper level.
It is no use caatingimud at domigeds, so we shall refrain
for the present from expressing our opinion of their
condnot until they subside into their normal insignifi-
cance.
The match between the English team and Sand-
hurst 22 resulted in a draw. The 22 went in first a"d
made 100 runs —Mavaleck 24, and Q. N. Campbell 23,
being the highest scorers. Steel took eight wickets for
35, Bates three for 20, Barnes two for 8, Studd six for
19 The English Eleven made 117, the scores being—
Leslie (not out) 40, Bead 23. Barlow 11, Alexander (who
is playing for Morley) 13, Vernon 9, Bates?, Tylocote 3,
G. B. Studd 1, G. T. Studd 1, Steel 0, sundry 1. The
Sandhurst team made 119 in their second innings—G.
Maokay 29, A. J. Pierce 26, Bundle ‘ 14, and A. Maokay
12, being the double figure scorers. Barlow got one
wicket for 56. C. T. Studd eight for 43, and A. O. Steel
10 for 35. When the stumps were drawn, G. B. Studd
had made 19 (not out/, and Bates (notout) 9.
The race for .2100 aside, in watermen’s skiffs,
between Edward Triokett and William Clifford, came
off over the champion course on Saturday, resulting in
an easy victory for the lUawarra man. The men started
by mutual consent, but shortly after passing Chr’s
Point a foul occurred, and the boats were locked.
Triokett got away first, and had a lead of font lengths
before Clifford was undsr way. The umpire called the
men back, and a fresh start was made, Clifford leading
in the first fifty yards. Triokett came up, and at the
mile point was two lengths ahead A long stern chase
ensued, and after passing Putney Point Triokett began
to “cave in,” being entirely "rowed out.” Clifford
now came ap, and won the race as he liked. Both men
were londly cheered.
Undoubtedly a bad ending to a glorious progress
through the old country oomes out of the refusal of the
Australian Eleven to play in the Victorian and N.S.
Wales matches against the English team. We have
beard a deal about maintaining in England the
"honour” of Australia, but evidently our precious
“ honour ” may go about its business in Australia as
far as the Australian Eleven are concerned. What im-
portanoe is attashed in the colonies to the result of a
match between the Australian Eleven and fifteen Ade-
laide men, while N.S. Waka, deserted by her best
players, is trying to do successful battle against the
English team. Leaving the "honour” out of the
question, as it exists evidently in exact proportion te
the gate-money, the Australian Eleven have treated
with scant courtesy the members ef the N.S.W. Asso-
oiation, who did much towards the formation of the
team. We anticipate with pleasure the match between
the Australian and English teams, but we should have
liked to see the N.S.W. contingent play this week for
their oolony.
Murrumbidgee Turf Club Races. The weather
was so nnfavenrable on the 22nd. that the races had to
be postponed. However, the 23rd proved to be a beau-
tifully fine day, and the attendance was far above the
average. St. Lawrence was made a hot favourite for
the Sires' Produce Stakes, which he won rather easily.
The Selling Stakes was a victory for Trump by seven
lengths. Eleven started for the Wagga Cnp, which
resulted in a clever win for Cnnnamulla, who went
through his work like a racehorse, carrying 9 st., and
covering the distance in 3 min. 34 sec. Willeroo was
second, and Jessie third. Ethel won the Hurdle Bacs
rather easily. The Maiden Plate resulted in rather an
easy victory for Jessie.—The second day’s racing opened
with the Derby, for which Aide-de-Camp was made the
favourite, and he won by a length after a great race.
Only two started for the Produce Stakes, and St. Law-
renoe won in a canter. Willeroo was backed at even
money for the Grand Stand Handicap, and he wen by a
length and a half. The Prince of Wales’ Stakes fell to
Mnsjid. The Flying Handicap brought about a great
race between Coolibah and Stookdale, the former win-
ning by a head.—On the third day, Stookdale won the
Mile Handicap on the post. Hope and Cumberoona
ran a dead heat for the Two-year-old Handicap. Cue.
namulla was made the favourite for the Town Plate, bat
he could secure only third place, Eva winning rather
comfortably. Juggler won the Steeplechase easily.
For the Final Flatter, Maejid ran a dead heat with
First Flight.
On 23rd November, the first heats of an
amateur sculling contest for an advertising trophy
given by a certain firm of champagne makers—
" Most and Chandon,” we believe, though it's so long
since we tasted the "glorious vintage," that we’re
really not sure about the matter —took place on the
Parramatta Biver, In the first division the following
started: —J. Arthur, C. W. Gaden, and J. Trimble.
Qaden took the lead, Arthur being second. The latter
steered an excellent course and got level with bis
leader at Blaxland’s Point. A great straggle ensued,
after which Arthur took things quietly, and Gaden,
seemingly on sufferance reached the winning post half
a length ahead. The following started for the second
division:—A. Sharland, Q. W. Brett, D. D. Middle; on,
C. A. Bros. Sharland, rowing well, took the lead,
Brett, Brow, and Middleton following in the order
named. The latter rowed well, and at Blaxland’s
Point was spurting grandly, having left Bros after*.
Brett managed to overhaul the Tasmanian, and even-
tually won by about two lengths. Middleton made a
great attempt to beat Sharland, but the latter managed
to keep ahead, and eventually beat him by two lengths.
Bros was some distance in the rear. The final heat
caused considerable excitement and produced one of
the best races ever rowed on the river, /ftera good
start, Arthur took tbo lead. At Uhr’s |Polnt Gadei
led, Sharland and Arthur level, with Brett last. Brect
drew up and at tke mile point was second. A desperate
race now ensued to Putney, Qaden passing the Point
with a slight load, Brett second, and Arthur close up.
Here all the rowers fell to pieces, but Gaden picked
himself up again, and holding W.Q.B, he passed the flag
nearly four lengths ahead ef Brett, wno was about six
lengths ahead of Sharland. Arthur rowed in a strange
boat which did not suit him. Mr. Gaden is to be com-
plimented upon a victory of skill, muscle, and pluck.

Red-haired girls may profitably read the follow-
ing description of one of their own kind“ A girl with
red hair looked very nice in a myrtle-rreon skirt, with
grey and grcea checked woollen stuff for overdress.
Her bonnet was of dark red straw, the brim being
covered with white beaded laoe, falling over white wild
roses. Tbe strings were of dark red ribbon, and round
her throat was a white gauze tie. It is rather difficult
for a girl with red hair to manage colours well, but this
was a decided success.’*

A. gentleman was discussing deeds of daring
with two young ladies on tbe pier at Botany. A hint
being thrown out about his own courage, ho gave a hoy
a sovereign to jump into tbe sea, and depend upon being
saved by him. The boy did, and the gentleman plunged
off the end of the pier and brought him out safely. The
w\ter was some twelve feet deep, and not warm either.
We doubt whether chivalry alone prompted the deed.
In these davs, a man would not risk drowning, wet all
his good clothe*, and spend a sovereign—for nothing.

Girls who love dancing will be glad to hear of
the “Demon Waltzsr,” which is a light wooden frame
of adinstable height. It has a padded shoulder for the
ladv's left hand to rest on, and from the middle pro-
jects a jointed arm, which fits on to the young lady’s
waist, and can be screwed to just tbe desired degree of
tightness. The "Demon’’ travels on ball castors, so
as to go freely in any direction. As the whole affair
can be easily carried and set up at a momeat’s notice,
no girl need now be a wallflower. And if she does not
get on well with her partner, every one will know whose

Another quarterly sociable was held the
Gymnasium on the 23-d Nov., when folly half the
number of spectators were ladies, who took a sparkling
interest in the proceedings. Many of them were mem-
bers of the ladies’ afternoen class At eight o’clock,
the German Band struck up their overture, and they
played selections all through the evening. Commencing
with dumb-bell exercise, and afterwards using the
standing appurtenances, a baker’s dozen of the members
showed what they could do. Some of the exercises
had of c rmrse, been seen before, but many new items
of skill and agility were introduced, and all were cor-
rectly accomplished. Printed programmes were found
useful, and ladies were thereby saved much perplexity
in trying to distinguish the slanting ladder from the
swinging trapeze, or the parallel bars from a pair of
boxing doves. Illustrations of what the genteel Gaul
terms le hoxe were given by Professor D’Harcourt and
a smart young surveyor. Hunter Brothers fenced with
considerable ferocity. They were very smart—they
made each other so. A statuesque show of wrestling
was given by a thick young gentleman who, when he is
not engaged accumulating muscle, coants untold gold
in the Commercial Bank, and a gentleman whose
physique was an admirable specimen of athletic sym-
metry. The struggles were only sham ones, yet the
counterfeiting was not light work oa a sultry night,
snd the perspiration streamed down the great rolls of
straining muscle as they gripped and hugged. The
reckless young man from the Telegranh Department
skipped on tbe scene—late, but still smiling—and
executed some graceful ‘‘tricks’’ without terminating
his life insurance; and, after some horie-vanlting, a
tag of war, etc., the hall was empty by ten o’clock.

bosoms look in calm contemplation on the crowd balow,
and the " dim religions light” streams in through the
large stained glass windows —and we saw banealhthe

sat waiting for the sonorous strains of the mnsic to
cease. He sat at a red-covered table, on a red-drared
dais, with a red screen behind, and a number of antique
tomes with red edges in front of him, everything—from
the drapery to the doctor himself —having the appear-
ance of being deeply red. There was no chairman, no
introduction. When the organ shopped. Dr. Badbam
plunged, without preface, into the subject, sketched in
a few words a history of Dante’s times, and told of ths
birth, banishment, love, work, and death of ths poet.
He enlarged on his great life-love, his love which was a
religious worship of the beautiful Beatrice, and the
depth of which no common mortal could gauge. It was
his vast love for her which prompted him to so va=t a
work as " The Vis ; on,” and fostered his great ambition
to say to her (as he could only in such a grand and
passionate poem) something such as had never boen
said before by any man to any other woman. Ths
lecture was plentifully interspersed with quota!ions
from Dante’s works in the vernacular, given with con-
siderable force and feeling. Whsn the doctor was quot-
ing Italian, ho sailed along with a smooth and easy
eloquence which we admired, but when he came down
again to common English and stopped in the middle of
a sentence for about seventy-five seconds, to hunt up
ths next sheet of his MS., we felt what a detriment it is
to read a lecture. Several times he was placed at a
disadvantage, by having to engage in a severe struggle
with his voluminous manuscript, which ne«rlv got the
better of the leerned doctor; but the lecture was
nevertheless scholarly and ornate. At the close there
was no vote of thanks, no acknowledgment of any kind
made; the organ started again, and the assemblage
dispersed.

London Truth said months ago that “ a

rebellion in Egypt," and now poin's to the battle of
Tal-el-Kelir to show that its estimate was not far
wrong. It holds that that "transaction was not a
battle, is was a slaughter; it was not fighting, it was
an advance on our part and a precipitate retreat on the
part of our opponents." It points out that our killed
ant wounded did not exceed 3 per cent ; whereas in
the great battles of the Crimae, 2-5 per cent, were pit

The rivalry between the Age and Abottb is
daily increasing in interest, says a Melbourne corres-
ponddlft who “knows the ropes ’’ The younger paper
has made such rapid strides within the past five years
that it has completely cut out the senior sheet in
political influence—their respective circulations being
as four to one respectively. And it is fast gaining the
advertising proportions of the older journal, which now
gets no more per column for its space than does the
Age. Report says that the Argus will, so soon as its
stereotyping plant arrives, come out at 2d.; and that,
should such an event take place, the Age will be daily

illustrate admirably the present position of parties in
Victoria —the Age being the Democratic organ of the
people, the Argus merely the Conservative mouth-
piece of would be aristocrats, whose chief recom-
mendat;on is their wealth. The credit of the ad-
vance made by the Age is due mainly to “Boss”
Syme, and his brilliant editorial writer, Mr. Windsor,
quondam editor of the Argus —the retrogression
of which is owing to the “shortsighted" policy
of G-owen Evans (the Melbourne club oracle), the chief
controller of its politics, and young Macainnen, a

A little incident (says a somewhat giddy American
contemporary) reoen i ly happened at a pro miuent ta-hiou-
able Summer resort t ea' the Hab, whhh has caused
quite a breeze (which is still blowing). It seems that a
very handeome and accomplished young lady has since
her arrival a few weeks ago been captivating the hear s
of several well-known venUemen, an engagement beii g
reported to have already taken place, the fortunate
gentleman being well-known in New York society. A
few days after the engagement, so the story goes, tl e
young lady had the pleasure of receiving from her icvtr
a present of a pair of garters, which she accepted as all
right and proper nnde* the circumstances. This pretend
is what has cans*! the breeze. The young lady im is-
oreetly but naturally displayed to several of her most
intimate lady friends the garters which had been pre-
sented to her, and which she was wearing. They wne
much admired, particularly the clasps, which were
brilliantly set with jewels. A jealons rival of the young
lady soon made the particulars of this little incident
known among the principal gossips (or Mrs. Gruniys)
at the hotels, who soon were discussing the matter of
the impropriety of any gentleman giving or any lady
accepting garters as a present. Tbe young couple have
been very freely criticise!, bat a large majority of their
friends fail to see any special impropriety in the matter,
and the resalt is likely to be that this incident will add
a new item to the etiquette of fashionable society, and
that engagement garters will soon be considered the
correct thing.
