"THE BULLETIN."
(Published at SYDNIRY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly-Austraila's Nonpareil
Illustruted Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Comnlete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System-one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Tniversal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless newspaper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established A us-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the chums of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact —
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

'RUPTURE CURED!
-FOR FIFTY SHILLINGS!
Hilqard, Oregon, June 28,1893.
Dr. Pierce & Son.—Gentlemen: I am happy to in-
Jform you that the Truss I bought of you last April has I
Jf completely cured me of a very severe case of Hernia,
Ifrom which I have suffered for over 18 years. I was
Irather sceptical about your Truss w hen I bought it, as I
Jhadtried several so-called Elastic Trusses wi thoutderiv-
|ing any benefit from them; but after using your Truss for
J a short time I was convinced that it was the best lever
Fhad, as it was easy to wear, and seemed to stop the severe
pains that often prostrated me while wearing the old i
Spring trusses; and now, in spite of my scepticism, lam /
Perfectly Cured, and can work with the Truss off if I j
I feel so disposed, but I still wear it loosely as it is not!
I inconvenient. You may add the above to your otherf
I testimonials. Gratefully yours, FRED. HANSEN,
above cure was effected in less than three J
months time, at a total cost to the patient of £2.9.5, j
Thousands of similar cures have been made. Pam-
I phlet mailed to any address. Write for itTO-DAYI j

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1894.
A Voice from Delaware.
Ever with us is the daily-newspaper corres-
pondent who insists that the world can only
be regenerated by the lash. His latest
appearance is in the columns of the Sydney
Telegraph, where he cheerfully signs him-
self “ Castigator ” —a term which is the
practical equivalent of stipendiary gaol-
flogger—and he heads his effusion “ How to
deal with our Larrikins.” As an explana-
tion of how the larrikin should be dealt with
ho points to the bright example of the State
of Delaware (U.S.) as recently expounded
in the American press ;
While public flagellation has ceased as a mode of pun-
ishment for crime or petty offences in most places, the
public whipping-post is still an institution in the State of
Delaware. It is not at all impossible that its merits are
not understood by most people, and that, as a preventive
of crimes and misdemeanours, it may have great useful-
ness. In any event, the present Governor of the State is
reported to have said lately in relation to this time-
honoured institution:
“ We are old-fashioned people down in Delaware, and I
presume we are away behind the times in a goed many
things, and rather set in our ways, and that "method of
dealing with certain classes of criminals is one of our ways.
Now, I am not an apologist for the whipping-post, because
I don't believe that Delaware needs any apologies to be
made for her people or her acta, and if 1 did they
wouldn’t come with very good grace from her executive,
but I can tell you some facts.
“There is not in the State of Delaware to-day a single
penitentiary. If a man beats his wife, or sets fire to a
neighbour’s barn, or breaks into a house, he isn’t shut up
with a lot of other criminals, with full time and oppor-
tunity to learn all their tricks of deviltry that he did not
know before. As a preventive of crime the whipping-
post lias a much greater terror than a term in the peni-
tentiary, and I have never known of a man who came
back for a second dose. He simply leaves the State. You
may rest assured that if he stays in Delaware he lives a
very quiet life. To be sure, it is a relic of barbarism, but
it is our way.”
• # •
The above is a picture of the ideal com-
munity according to the aggressively Right-
Thinking Person. While all the other States
of the civilised world are groping in the
dark for a solution of the problem of crimin-
ality, Delaware alone has settled the ques-
tion in one act —poor, little, barren, obscure,
moss-grown Delaware, which never con-
tribute! one among the many great men of
America—a relic of the seventeenth century
that sleeps an eternal sleep right alongside
the busiest State of the Union, and yet
seems never to catch a single echo of the
world beyond its own borders. Delaware
believes in the lash according to its own old,
dull, obtuse Dutch principles, and the Right-
Thinking Person of Australia holds it up to
reverence as a bright example, and one
specially worthy of imitation. Whether
Delaware believes in the lash because it is
the slowest, stupidest and most hopelessly
petriffed State in the Union, or whether it is
petrified and unprogressive because its dull,
old burghers have flogged every semblance
of originality out of each successive genera-
tion as it came to the front, is a matter for
conjecture. Anyhow, the Right-Thinking
Person wants Australia to become what
Delaware now is. That cat-ridden State is
his ideal.
* « «
Yet, oven in Delaware it would seem the
lash is a failure. The criminal isn’t neces-
sarily reformed; “he simply leaves the
State.” Instead of being flogged into a state
of grace he is merely flogged into the State
of Maryland. And if the use of the grand
old cat were universal there would be no
adjacent State of Maryland to take refuge
in—therefore, the partially-skinned criminal
would remain, and be a curse and a burden
to the community just as he was previous to
the judicial skin-removal.
* # #
The person who writes to the Telegraph,
in this case, heads his letter “ How to deal
with our larrikins.” This is characteristic.
The flogging person never by any chance
suggests the lash as a remedy for embezzle-
ment, the floating of bogus banks, the
issuing of fraudulent balance-sheets, forgery,
breach of trust (when an eminent solicitor
deprives some poor and credulous client of
his entire life’s savings, under the plea that
they became accidentally mixed up with his
overdraft, and is then suspended for six
months), dishonest bankruptcy, seduction by
an esteemed church member, or any other
“respectable” offence. Yet these are ten
times more disastrous than larrikinism,
which is only one of the smallest among a
hundred brutal offences. Also, he ignores
the obvious fact that if the lash should be
used upon the larrikin because all the other
processes of law have failed to suppress that
hog-like offender, it should also be used with
equal vigour on the banker and the fraudu-
lent solicitor, and every other criminal,
because the ordinary processes of law—after
a trial lasting over centuries—have failed to
suppress any of them. In fact, all the
processes of law ever invented have not
suppressed any single crime whatsoever,
therefore flogging should evidently be
universal. It is a remarkable instance of
the hideous lopsidedness of the Right-
Thinking Person’s intelligence that he
should first draw a picture of an ideal
state where, according to his version of
it, flogging is the remedy for every
crime, and then point to it as merely a
remedy for larrikinism. It would be equally
appropriate to describe it as a remedy for
defaulting solicitors, but the ordinary right-
thinking intellect could not grasp so awful a
possibility.
* * •
If the good old Tory who professes to
admire the ideal system of Delaware is pre-
pared to give that system an absolutely fair
and comprehensive trial, The Bulletin,
much as it loathes the whole disgusting
business, will raise no objection. This
paper has seen a prominent merchant
with much political influence commit,
on two occasions, an act of disgusting
indecency on a crowded city railway
platform in the presence of one police-
man and a dozen officials, and up to date
he hasn’t been flogged or even arrested.
It has heard the lash ordered by a judge,
who had himself, if the law were administered
with any semblance of equity, qualified, to
the knowledge of almost everybody, for forty
separate and individual floggings ; and by a
police-magistrate whose mere existence con-
stituted a blasphemy against female virtue.
And it has seen these sentences carefully
“ considered ” by a Cabinet, at least one
member of which spent most of his
life in prowling around dark lanes, either
committing, or looking for a chance to
commit, or “ squaring,” partly by money
and partly by police terrorism, the relatives
of children upon whom he had committed
offences which cannot be described in print.
Also, it has read in Hansard vigorous ora-
tions demanding the extension of the lash, by
at least half-a-dozen members who, to the
knowledge of a large number of citizens,
have earned it, even under the provisions of
the old, uriextended law, many times over.
Yet nobody ever dreamt of calling any of
these individuals to account. Neither did
anybody ever see or ever dream of seeing
the shiny pot-hat of the blackguardly poten-
tate hung on the summit of the triangles
while the owner of it was being flayed under-
neath.

To sum the matter up—if flogging is a
remedy for one kind of crime, then it is a
remedy for any other kind, and if it should
be tried in one case because all other penal-
ties have proved ineffective, then it should
be tried in every other case because other
penalties have been a universal failure. And
if the advocates of the lash are willing to
demonstrate their falsely alleged faith in it by
making it the punishment for the crimes of
their own class as well as those of another
class—to apply it equally to both sexes and
to make it the punishment for every offence
in the calender—to flog the notoriously foul
Judge and magistrate, and the influential
mercantile hog, and the ex-Minister who has
been thrown out of half-a-dozen hotels for
glaring indecency, and the blasphemous
member of Parliament, and the ancient, dirty
politician whose stories can’t be told in print,
and the fraudulent business man, and the
representative citizen’s wife who suffers from
what is mildly described as kleptomania -
then The Bulletin is willing to give the
new system a fair trial. And, considering
that the advocates of the lash profess to
believe that it will abolish crime, and con-
sidering that nothing else has ever abolished
any crime, their reluctance to apply the
boasted nostrum all round can 1 e explained
on one assumption only. The Fat Man who
knows the only thing which will suppress
criminality, and yet objects to use it except
for the suppression of one offence only, and
that an offence which he is too fat and short-
winded to perpetrate,doesn’t want criminality
suppressed.

The other day, in Victoria, a new hangman
and gaol-flogger was appointed, and he made
his first essay, in the latter capacity, on the
back of a common person whose name this
paper doesn’t remember. The experiment
was a failure, however ; the hangman didn’t
make a sufficiently horrible mess of his sub-
ject, and the proceedings were suspended
when the first criminal was about one-quarter
through, so that the public functioi ary might
have further rehearsal. At the second
attempt, it is gratifying to learn, he gave
every satisfaction. The right-thinking press
deals gently with this unpleasant episode as
if it was almost a little ashamed of it. Yet
why it should be ashamed is hard to under-
stand. If the lash will abolish crime—as it
is asserted a thousand times over that it will
—then it is an institution of which the coun-
try should be proud—a thing that is greater
than the Law and the Prophets, and
more commendable than the Gospel, and
grander than all ancient and modern
religions and philosophies. And, consider-
ing the unspeakable benefits to be obtained,
the aggregate Right-thinking Person should
be glad to see the erring daughter of his own
class fixed to the triangles and flogged by a
stout female warder, or his son in a similar
situation regenerated by the successor
of hangman Jones. Yet, somehow, he
is not glad. It is a strange and horrible cir-
cumstance that the fatted Tory knows of a
means whereby crime can be abolished, and
yet refuses to use it except to abolish one
offence occasionally committed by one class,
or rather by a small section of one class.
The only possible assumption is, as already
mentioned, that he doesn’t want to abolish
crime, and the man who occupies that posi-
tion is a voluntary and hardened accessory
before and after the act, and being so he is
himself a criminal, and being a criminal he
ought to be flogged by his own showing for
his own regeneration.
Secular Education.
Rev. J. Dunne, R.C. Bishop of Wilcannia
(N.S.W.), affirms that Catholics cannot consis-
tently vote for supporters of “ free, secular,
and compulsory ” State education. This means
that priestly influence will be used at next
election against all candidates who uphold the
established educational system. It therefore
becomes necessary to re-state the reasons which
justify that system. The grounds of State
interference with education are compactly set
forth by Mr. Bevington, a Queensland
teacher:—
The education of the children of a nation is a duty owed
to them by their parents in the first instance ; and if we
could depend on fathers and mothers to faithfully dis-
charge this obligation there would be no occasion for the
machinery of schools, either supported by private persons
or by the State. But in practice we find that, in countries
where children are solely dependent on their natural
guardians for mental culture, the majority of the people
grow up in a state of ignorance. Governments, therefore,
with the full approval of their subjects, have, in nearly
all civilised countries, more or less interfered, and have
established schools or assisted to provide means whereby
the children of all citizens may acquire the rudiments of
knowledge. This they do, not out of benevolence, but
for their own protection and for the good of the common-
wealth.
On these principles the Australian provinces
have based their educational systems. /The
ideal has always been that “ free, secular, and
compulsory” ideal which Bishop Dunne con-
demns. The practice has consistently followed
the ideal as far as local conditions would
permit. It has always been recognised, on the
point of freedom, that the whole community
must bear the cost of a work which directly
concerns the whole community. It has always
been recognised, on the point of compulsion,
that we cannot afford to let thoughtless or
selfish parents refuse the blessing of knowledge
for their children. It has always been recog-
nised, on the point of secularisation, that it is
not the business of the State to Leach religion ;
that the aim of Government in a civil society
is nob to advocate the Christian creed, or the
Jewish creed, or the Buddhist creed, or any
other creed, but simply to make a good citizen,
independent of creed ; that morality is not a
question of belief in any particular dogma, and
that so long as a man obeys the laws in this world
we may leave him to build his home where he
pleases in the next.
These conclusions now form part and parcel
of the belief of unbiassed, intelligent men.
Bishop Dunne does not directly dispute them.
He goes so far as to say that Catholics “do
not expect religion to be taught in public
schools. Such is not the office or function of a
State like ours.” But he insists that Catholics
are prevented by conscientious scruples from
taking advantage of the benefits of the existing
public school system, and demands that
Catholic schools shall be subsidised from the
public funds in proportion to the Catholic
population. Then he adds a significant threat
that the Labour-party will be opposed by
Catholic voters unless it acquiesces in this
demand, which is equivalent to a promise of
Catholic support if the demand is conceded.
Bishop Dunne says that the subsidising of
Catholic schools does not mean the establish-
ment of denominational schools. His denial
cannot alter the fact. At the present time,
there is no justification for the “ conscientious
scruples ” which the Catholics are said to hold.
Public education in New South Wales, if not
strictly secular, is absolutely unsectarian. The
Bible is recognised as containing a code of
morals, but not as defining the tenets of a
creed. Catholics and Protestants'teach side by
side. If the Catholic clergy' were willing,
Catholics and Protestants would learn side by
side. Many Catholics do, in defiance of the
priesthood, send their children to the public
schools, where, as a rule, they are better taught
than in the Catholic schools. But the majority
obey the priests.
• * »
If the State encouraged the teaching of
religion apart from morals, there would at once
be grounds for conscientious scruples. As soon
as it moves from the platform of secular
education, it is lost. What would follow the
subsidising of Catholic schools? Bishop Dunne
knows that the very first result would be claims
for subsidy to Church of England schools, to
Presbyterian schools, to Wesleyan schools, to
Jewish schools and to schools of every other
denomination. And the claims would be just.
The State which encourages one religion is
bound to encourage other religions ; the State
which assists one sect is bound to assist other
sects. At present, Catholic and Protestant,
Christian and heathen, can together enjoy the
benefits of State education. Once subsidise
religious schools, and State education is at an
end. Denominational education, witli all its
drawbacks, deficiencies, and perils, stands in
the place.
* # #
Have Australians not had enough of denomi-
national education? What are the results of reli-
gious as compared with secular instruction ? The
church has had a free educational hand until
very recently, and in every progressive country
it has been found necessary to substitute
national for clerical education. This substi-
tution has taken place in Australia and
America, France and Germany; it is still
taking place in the United Kingdom. Is Aus-
tralia to lead a retrograde movement ? The two
most illiterate countries in Europe are Spain
and Russia ; and these are the two where the
people are most completely under the control
of priests. The population of the South and
West of Ireland, where priestly influence is
paramount, are the most illiterate in the United
Kingdom.
• * •
Denominational education, on the lines sug-
gested by Bishop Dunne, now exists in Canada
with results disastrous to the peace and welfare of
the Dominion. There are State-aided Catholic
schools and State-aided Protestant schools, each
class having its own system of religious train-
ing. In the Protestant school hymns are sung
to Jesus; in the Catholic schools to Mary.
Thus the hope of united citizenship is poisoned
at the springs.,/* The Protestant child is trained
from infancy to look askance at the Catholic
child, who, in turn, is taught that he belongs to
a class set apart from the others. Naturally
the separation of childhood becomes a barrier
impassable at maturity ; and the way is paved
for feud and dissension which the Australian
system does its best to avoid.
/ • * •
Humanity, in its progress, has broken down
many barriers to civil and religious liberty.
Bishop Dunne desires to re-erect one incon-
sistent, not only with liberty, but with equality
and fraternity also. At this day and in this
country, he can hardly hope for success. What-
ever their religion, honest citizens must agree
that it is the duty of the State, not to do the
work of this priest or that parson, to inculcate
this dogma or that dogma, to assist this sect or
that sect, but to maintain laws by which all
sects and all religions may enjoy a common
freedom. S
* * «
The hostility of the priestcraft to secular
education is, of course, no new thing. Their
share in the training of youth has been the
chief support of their power in the past; it is
the chief arm upon which they rely in the pre-
sent to combat the spirit of the age. Ignorance
has been the best friend of ecclesiastical autho-
rity—hence the fixed ecclesiastical determina-
tion to control the spring of knowledge. The
evolution of the human race is a continual
triumph of reason and labour at the expense
of superstition. Bit by bit, as men have
acquired self-reliance, they have seen that it
is less their duty to fear their gods than to
love their neighbours. “The first grave was
the first cathedral. The first corpse was the
first priest ; and when the last priest is one,
the world will be free ”
» * *
That time approaches. Nearly 40 years ago,
Walt Whitman wrote that “ there will soon
be no more priests. Their work is done. A
new order shall arise, and they shall be the
priests of man, and every man shall be his own
priest.” Time confirms the accuracy of this
judgment. The religions on which man leant
in the youth of the world are gradually losing
power., “Light half-believers in our casual
creeds,” we realise more and more every day
that they are mere products of ourselves.
“ You consider Bibles and religions divine—l
do not say they are not divine; I say they have
all grown out of you, and may grow out of
you still. It is not they who give the life —
it is you who give the life ; leaves are not more
shed from the trees, or trees from the earth,
than they are shed out of you.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Reid the Missionary.
Interviews with Robt. Reid are being duly
reported by the cable since that devoted man
reached London, and invited the correspondents
of his admiring Melbourne organs to dinner.
These submarine communications seem absurd
enough to raise a smile, but the thought that
they are intended to be taken seriously, and
are taken seriously by the average foul of a


reader, is not a subject for mirth. Reid and
his mission, and the dignity accorded to trans-
parent nonsense by “great” journalism, are
disheartening things to reflect upon in the small
hours of the night, when the enthusiasm of the
would-be reformer is at its lowest ebb, and the
mighty forces of Humbug appear most formid-
able. Take an extract from a cable message re
the glorified draper-citm-Minister of Defence.
“He states that the enquiries he has so far
made encourage the hope that he will be success-
ful in his efforts to increase the commerce of
Victoria.” How dire is the ignorance of a
world that, for the most part, accepts such
pompous clap-trap statements, instead of spit-
ting upon the print that prints them, and hurl-
ing" contumely in the mouth that gave them
utterance ! Reid on a voyage of discovery of
“new markets for Victorian goods” is a joke
no less ghastly than Reid as a Free-
trade stimulator of Victorian importation.
The commerce of a country is not to
be dragged or coaxed hither and thither by
a soft-goods warehouseman and petty shop
promoter. There are thousands of foreign
buyers of wool, meat, fruit, grain and
dairy produce as fully alive to their own in-
terests as Robert Reid, and who know as
much about their business as Reid knows
about his. On this side, too, every line of com-
merce has its contingent of hungry—very
hungry, just now—agents, seeking to pinch a
living from it, and every industry is being edu-
cated by necessity to do the best it can for
itself. Were this windy “politician” from
Flinders Lane a supreme jack-of-all-trades,
travelling on commission for every producer
or manufacturer in Victoria, he would still
be only Reid offering stuff which is
already on offer, and which will inevitably bp
sold when anybody wants to buy it at the
price. The greatest of drummers cannot make
commerce for a country at large. And Robt.
Reid is not a drummer in this instance. He is
merely a fictitious missionary, an electioneering
dodge, despatched by the Patterson Govern-
ment at considerable expense upon an errand
of blather and skite, and all that is most con-
temptible in public fiddlededee. Flinders
Lane, indeed, may have some vague, fat-headed
idea that Reid can increase the inflow of
commerce from dear old ’Ome, by advising a
reduction in protective duties, but this is a
scheme which Victoria will presently begin to
see through with its dim, glassy eye.
The Reconstructed Debtor.
Mr. Wall, a hitherto obscure member of the
New South Wales Assembly, lias originated a
new idea in banking arrangements which has
much to recommend it. His proposition is
called “a Bill to suspend the operation of
mortgages, liens and other liabilities ’ held by
reconstructed banks. These banks have re-
ceived from their creditors from five to thirteen
years’ grace in which to pay up many millions
of liabilities—in other words, they have been
allowed to confiscate for that period nearly all
the money in the province. But, at the same
time, they are not compelled to extend any such
consideration to their debtors, and in very many
cases they don’t extend any consideration what-
ever. It sometimes happens that the same
man will have a fixed deposit and a temporary
overdraft in the same battered institution, and
the bank, having been graciously allowed by
him several years in which to pay up the
deposit, reserves to itself the right to seize its
forbearing creditor by the throat, and sell him
up, and generally ruin him, and finally fire him
out, an insolvent wreck, into the street on
account of the overdraft. A very large propor-
tion of the men who are now being squeezed to
death by reconstructed banks are unable to
pay, simply because one or other of these same
banks will not pay them. The selling-up pro-
cess is not yet in full blast, but there are signs
that it will soon become general. Therefore,
Mr. Wall’s bill proposes to enact that the re-
constructed banks, which are living on the
consideration of others, shall be forced to ex-
tend a certain amount of consideration in
return. Wherever they have made advances
upon securities they are to be prohibited from
selling the said securities by any sudden and
violent process, and are to accept payment by
instalments—on their own system —extending
over a certain number of years. The equity
of the arrangement is beyond question.
In most cases a good £lOOO security, which
was deposited in the ante-burst days to
cover a £4OO overdraft, wouldn’t realise
£4OO now at a forced sale, for the sufficient
reason that the banks have practically confis-
cated the ready money of the community, and
hardly anybody has any spare funds to buy
with. Therefore, the reconstructed institutions
are mainly responsible for the present hideous
depreciation, and when the bank is allowed to
ruin its embarrassed customer by way of
revenge for the injury which the bank has
already done him, the arrangement is alto-
gether one-sided. Nevertheless, the prospects
of Mr. Wall’s measure are not bright. The
New South Wales Legislature is owned, body
and soul, by the financial institutions, and the
pawnshops which reconstructed at the public
expense will doubtless do their utmost to pre-
vent anyone else reconstructing at their ex-
pense. There are, of course, one or two
honourable exceptions, but the majority, when-
ever their own affairs were arranged, proceeded
like toothless furies to claw out the bowels of
their weaker debtors, and have been busy at it
ever since.
Patterson’s Satisfaction.
The Victorian Legislature, it is interesting to
learn, gives complete and perfect satisfaction to
Premier Patterson. Others may think they
smell corruption and detect blatant folly in the
Assembly presided over by Thomas Bent, but
the exalted meat-dealer from Castlemaine finds
no cause for complaint, or even for criticism.,]
If a general election took place to-morrow, the
patriot Patterson would be sorry to see even
one of the existing senators displaced. Had the
late scamp, Robert Bowman, remained in
existence until last week, Patterson would
doubtless have fired off his Ballarat remark just
the same, for he never publicly said anything
against Bowman while the latter still lived.
Indeed, there are many more objectionable
persons than Bowman among the survivors
—but the painful fact that they are not dead
preserves them from special mention. For
an illustration of Patterson’s idea of true
worth, the libel-laws necessitate a visit to the
cemetery, which—contrary to the doctrine of
drivel —should never be used as a hiding-place
for public scandals. Premier Patterson, then,
considers that the country which elects
Bowman, and a number of others of his species,
to seats in the Senate has done all that
it can to procure an honest and capable
administration of affairs. He doesn’t know of
one ass or a single rogue sitting within the
authority of Bent’s mace. Or, at any rate,
Patterson knows not of any such whose ser-
vices to the country could be safely dispensed
with. There is the real point, perhaps. With
Patterson anil his node prosequi Government
to direct its political course, Victoria has no
occasion to feel uneasy. The present Assembly,
as a whole, supports Patterson, wherefore he
deprecates the introduction of any considerable
quantity of fresh air. It might be fatal to the '
old stagers who have battened on the noisome
atmosphere of these latter years and—more
especially—these latter months. In political as
in parish scavengering life, hardy men are dis-
posed to feel sick of the conditions of their daily
work, should it suddenly lose some of the old
impurity and become comparatively wholesome.
Patterson achieved supreme power in an
atmosphere of political stink, ami he not un-
naturally believes that stink is beneficial to the
Victorian constitution.
Torture by Instalment.
Certainly the eternal fitness of things never
found a fitter example than the political cata-
clysm in Victoria which set ci-devant butcher-
dom to be at least the figure-head of a law of
butchery. The other day a shrieking wretch,
one of three sentenced to be skinned alive by
the State flayer, was triced up to get his
“twenty-five” in the ordinary Melbourne
course. When a few lashes had been
given, the flagellator was stopped. He was a
new and unpractised hand and didn’t hit hard
enough. So the victim, who had been con-
gratulating himself that surely the bitterness
of death was past, was untriced and led away
toawait the time when theclinnsyscourger should
be fully instructed in his art. A few days after-
wards, it would appear, “ Roberts,” having
taken his degree at the Melb. University of
Man-Skinning, the convict who had had only
six or seven lashes out of 25 was again triced
up to endure the balance of his torture ! The
Bulletin ventures to say that nothing more
cold-bloodedly atrocious than this was ever
done in old Botany Bay or Vandemonia—or,
for that matter, in Dahomey itself. It is in-
conceivable that the letter of the Victorian law
should sanction such unspeakable savagery. It
is reasonable (assuming flogging to be a punish-
ment permissible in a civilised country) that a
culprit should not altogether escape his lashing
merely because, for some absolutely unforeseen
and unavoidable reason, that lashing happens not
to have been carried out on the day originally
fixed. But (the apprehension of the torture of
the lash being an integral part of that savage
punishment) the action of the authorities
in dispensing in long - drawn - out instal-
ments a torture which was surely designed to
be applied in one dose, is an act of ineffable
ruffianism from which even Lagdom should
revolt. The man having been tied up and par-
tially skinned, the law (whose own fault
it was that a sufficiently accomplished
fiogger had not been provided) should have
remitted, as is done under such circumstances
even at Botany Bay, the balance of the torture.
As well put a pinioned coudamme under
the beam with the rope around his neck, and the
cap over his face, and tell him, after he has
listened to half the burial service, that you
have changed your mind and are not going to
hang him till next week, as do what was
done by consent of the Victorian Government
the other day to the miserable wretch who,
sentenced to be flogged serially —in three
chapters of 25 lashes each—was given the first
chapter in paragraphs.
The subjects of instruction in N.S.W. Abori-
ginal schools have been reviewed with the
result that, in future, only reading, writing, and
arithmetic, with dictation, will be taught.
Minister Suttor is not a da}' too early in setting
up the new system. Analysis, Greek and Latin
roots and history (which meant the names of
kings and queens) were sadly thrown away on
the juvenile aborigine. But it would not have
been amiss had the Minister directed that the
plain elements of physiology should be included
in the curriculum. The blacks are being killed
by adopting our virtxxes and vices, for neither
of which they possess the counteragents, and a
little instruction on these heads would do good.
Take dress. The black dresses in daytime
while the sun shines, because he then meets the
whites ; he goes naked in the evening and night
when the air is cold, because he meets no whites.
Hence, consumption, &c.
Sample of British humour from the Clarion,
which is much esteemed in the North of England
as a wildly mirthful publication and a thing of
infinite wit: —
Ring up the cur—hi, stop! One moment. Bid those
melancholy mad Orchestrions cease their dirge-like blurt-
ings and play something brisk and popular. “ The Bank
which Broke the Man at Monte Carlo” or “An Icicle
Built for Two ” would be cheerful and appropriate num-
bers. And give that syncopated baldhead with the trom-
bone a week’s notice. He can’t blow for nuts. Body o’
me, what solemn bifurcated perishers these mortals be.
And, ho, there! Steady with that limelight in the flies.
Don’t wobble it, my friend. Remember you have to
cover the whole of the ground, both pediment and
betterment, which is a periphrastic wav of putting
it, and not to be understood of the uninitiated. And
bid Cornelius Agriita bestow the fruit syrup under
the patent throne, an invention of my own, which at a
pinch can be converted—amongst other things—into a
step-ladder, a trouaers-stretcher, a Punch and Judy show,
ora Chapel of Ease. Sq. Wait until I get my right
thumb! n niy arm-hole, and the tips of my dexter digits
resting on the wash-hand stand. So. Now ring up. (It
you don’t keep that limelight steady, you miserable,
supererogatory super., I’ll come and break every hone in
your skin 1 What do you think we pay a shilling a night
far ?)
This is the noblest aspect of British humour—
the kind that is humorous bee uise it consists of
disjointed whoops, interspersed with cries of
“Ho, there,” and instructions to the alleged
minion to put the boiled egg among the regalia,
and to bestow the pea-soup in the arsenal.
John Haynes, M.L. A., as reported in the
Wellington (N.S.W.) Times, discoursing on
the Foreign-trade milleuniuip which is to come :
I will give the workers cheap bread, and to enable the
farmers to produce it I will give them cheap machinery.
This is John addressing the consumer, who is
always told that Foreign-trade means cheap
bread, and that Protection makes bread dear.
But only a few days previously the same John
Haynes, addressing an audience of farmers, at
Molong, told them that Protection had run
down the price of grain (and, consequently,
made food cheap) to such an extent that
the producer couldn’t make a decent living,
and urged them to vote for Foreign-trade on
the distinct assurance that it would remedy
this awful state of things, which plainly implies
that it will make food dear. Also, Eyeglass
Reid, speaking to the downtrodden agricul-
turists of Riverina, told them that Protection
had brought wheat down with a ruinous
thud to 2s. 2d. a bushel, and urged
them to cast off the incubus, and go in for
Freetrade and high prices. This is the same
old incongruity once more. The Foreign-trade
logician always curses Protection to the bread-
seller because it reduces prices, and curses it to
the bread-buyer because it raises prices. Then
when he is confronted by the anomaly he
assumes a pitying expression, and remarks
compassionately that his opponent is evidently
ignorant of the first principles of political
economy.
Striking example of daily-paper ignorance (or
misrepresentation) of Democratic men and
motives, from S.M. Herald of Jan. 25 :
Some lingering tracts of the old parochial feeling with
which class politics tend to connect themselves were still
visible [at the Labour Conference.] As, for example, in
the declaration of a Queensland delegate that “ the
Labour-parly in Queensland favoured territorial separa-
tion ; ” that is to say, the formation of tropical colonies,
to be certainly worked by tropical labour, with the danger
of this spreading throughout the continent.
Everybody with the least knowledge of Queens-
land politics is aware that the Labour-party
wishes territorial separation in order to make
North Queensland a white man’s country. It
is the opponents of Separation—the capitalists,
commission-agents, syndicates and exploiters
who now use the North as a dumping-ground
for Kanakas, Chinese, Javanese, Japanese and
Malays; and wdio are fighting tooth and nail
for the “formation of tropical colonies, to be cer-
tainly worked by tropical labour.” But wh Q t
can you expect from the S.M. Herald?
For the situation of clerk at a salary of £llO a
year the Onehunga (Maoriland) Borough Council
received some 40 applications, among them
being that of one who offered to do the duty for
£9O a year— i.e., for £2O a year less than the
advertised rate. Her Worship Mrs. Yates
(the only female Mayor and J.P. in the British
Empire) moved that he be appointed, and car-
ried her motion. She-wished to save £2O a
year, she said, to the borough. The Duke of
Wellington, when British Premier, once made
a somewhat similar proposal in the British
Parliament re the salaries of excise and
custom-house officers, urging that he could
get plenty of men willing to discharge
the duties at the reduced rates, to which
O’Connell replied that, so far as Ireland
was concerned, lie would guarantee to get
plenty of men to do the same work —for
nothing. Unfortunately there was no member
in the Qiiehunga Council to urge any such tell-
ing argument against Her Worship’s action,
although some of the more ignorant of them,
being males, considered any kind of argument
they advanced should have sufficient force to
convince a woman against her will. But they
were disappointed. The Bulletin much re-
grets the bad start made by the pioneer
Mayoress in thus championing sneakery and
starvation wages. Should a public body, of all
employers, set the example of putting up its
appointments to Dutch auction? Does Mrs.
Yates expect the wretch who has helped her
to “save £2O for the ratepayers” to keep a
wife? Or does she expect him to resign when
he gets married, if he is not already married ?
S.M. Herald, in a leading article on attempts
made by the public to intermediate between a
capitally-sentenced prisoner and the execution
of the sentence, says: “In the civil courts
individuals are continually lighting out their
differences or asserting their rights. It would
appear strange indeed if, after the authorised
judges and juries had done their work, friends
or people outside canie forward with informal,
but urgent, applications for a stay of judgment
or reduction of damages.” The Herald argu-
ment here is that, as the public do not interfere
when a man is ordered to pay £5 or £lOO,
it, therefore, ought not to interfere when a man
is sentenced to death. Put thus, the argument
is brutally cold-blooded, even for the property-
worshipping Herald. But it is fallacious
besides, for in civil cases a man may appeal
from court to court and thus have three or four
trials on the one account, whereas, as in the
Mount Rennie case, he may be hanged without
even one proper trial.

“The Bulletin’s” Missing-Word
Competition—No. 10.
The above Competition closed with 2101 entries,
and the total receipts were, consequently, <£loB
Is. The missing-word was “ repellent,” and as
not one competitor guessed it, the above amount
is carried forward to swell the pool for Competi-
tion No. 11. Nearly one-third of the sub
scribers pinned their faith to “arid,” and
there was also a considerable demand for
the word “ monotonous.” Among the rest
wex-e such strange ventures as “ beastly,” “ para-
doxical,” “ anhydrous ” (evidently sent in by a
learned competitor), “wealthy,” “solstital,” “cap-
ricornus,” “typical,” “blooming,” and “death
bed.” About 180 different words were sent in
altogether, but, apparently, the right one had
a fatality attached to it, and it never turned up.
Subscribers to Competition No. 11 are, therefore,
remind->1 that, with the <£loB Is. in hand, there
will, almost certainly, bo the largest pool on
record to be divided on February 23.

My Dear Moorabinda—
If there is an evil planet which is the bad genius
of public feeding, that star was evidently in a
sinister position when Gov. Duff came to town.
On Anniversary Day, at the regatta-flagship
(Ville de la Ciotat) luncheon, his unhappy Ex.
brought confusion on the whole spread by ukasing
that 1 p.m. (the arranged hour) was too late, as he
had to attend the races; so the toothsome French
cookery was dumped on to the board at the hor-
rible hour of noon, and people who couldn’t
accelerate their appetites to meet the emergency
gazed at the intricate menu as if it were a mirage.
And not only was the dejeuner postponed back-
wards, so to speak, but it was also galloped
through to get to the speeches. Though every-
body gobbled blocks of sustenance at top speed,
Captain Fiaschi had to rise before half the dishes
had been rushed round the saloon and introduce
the first toast—“ the Queen ” —while the gourmets
saw the gravy settling into streakiness and
resigned themselves to their doom.
Coming atop of this hurry-scurry some of the
speeches read amusingly. Said the unctuous
Mayor Manning (he is to be called Patrick, not
William, to prevent confusion), when proposing
Gov, Duff’s health : “ The fact that one man was
able to fill two positions (t.c., naval and guber-
natorial) which were so dissimilar only showed
how marvellous was the character of the typical
Englishman in regard to versatility.” And then,
after His Ex. had lunched in the desperate fashion
of a man at a railway buffet in order to do
honour to the Sydney Turf Club’s meeting, the
Mayor’s opinion that the Gov. was actuated by
“ a very earnest desire to serve his Queen and the
people of this country ” almost seemed to have a
grin on its face.
It strikes me that Gov. Duff is always in
extremes. He is either too indifferent to the
merry-making of his touchy subjects, or too per-
spiriugly eager to honour everybody’s Punch-and-
Judy, no matter how each entertainment suffers
by this meteoric system of patronage. Such a
flying-pieman way of keeping engagements—
unless deftly concealed, ruffles people as much as
if the Gov. didn’t turn up at all.
Gov. and Lady Jersey worked the shows hitch-
lessly, for mostly when “George” went East
“M.E.J.”went West, and tightened the silken
bonds on the tug-of-war principle. They didn’t
hunt in couples and confer a double extract of
vice regal essence on one undeserving shivoo, but
diluted their patronage and kept everybody going.
Ditto with the Caringtons, who travelled on
wings. There was never any hullaballoo over the
Baron’s valuable time, and I distinctly remember
that on one ’Versary day he “did ” the regatta,
thoraces, and a cricket-match without once visibly
consulting his watch.
“It is now, I believe,” said Gov. Duff, “ 106
years since Capt. Phillip brought bis ship to these
shores ; but although Capt. Phillip had, no doubt,
a great idea of the future of this land, I do not
suppose that he himself realised that he was lay-
ing the foundation of one of our greatest colonies.”
Very likely not. When a corporation cart de-
posits its burden on the site marked “ rubbish
shot here,.” it never even dreams that it is laying
the foundations of a marble town hall. The
Homeric Secretary Galton should steer His Ex.
clear of our forefathers, though, as we are so
ridiculous as to insist on commemorating their
landing, we fully deserve to be reminded of them.
I hear that Tasmania’s first Society man is not
exactly a hero to his own cook. Lord Gorman-
ston (or is it Gourmandston ?) is a personage who
likes to eat, which is almost a virtue in a Gov.,
provided he shares his platter with Society and
doesn’t give raspberry-sandwiches in public as an
economical set-off to private pdte de foie gras.
His lordship orders his own dinners and per-
sonally interviews his steak-griller. An amusing
story is afloat concerning the haste with which the*
Viscount rushed back to Hobart and his beloved
cook by special train from the other end of the
island when the delicacies prepared by the cordon-
bleu for the Vice-regal tour had given out.
This is an age of puff, but I really think a
Sydney draper capped every eccentricity of real-
istic advt. by exhibiting in his window a night-
gowned youth, aged fifteen or so, in a single bed,
in full view of the crowded street. It is not neces-
sary nowadays to be prudish, but I certainly think
the spectacle of that shock-headed boy tumbling
about in blankets, while grinning men and unde-
cided-how-to-look women peered in at him, was
not an edifying spectacle.
For this is the way to look at it. What sort of
an uproar would there have been round the
window if a girl of fifteen had been revealed
snoozling under the mosquito-nets with the evil
eye of all Sydney upon her? And why should it
be assumed that a decent boy is not quite as
modest as a decent girl? I only hope that such
advertisements will be nipped in the bud, for
one hardly sees where they will stop. From
the bed-chamber, the infinite possibilities of which
have surely not yet been half worked-out, the
really “live” cheap Jack may yet pass on to the
bath-room. “Wanted several handsome girls to
demonstrate the effect of Spofkins’ bath-tub in
our Blank-street window ” would render that
thoroughfare impassable for a week.
Sydney Turf Club races, at Randwick, lured a
moderately-robed assemblage to the members’
stand. The most gafish features of the Members’
were undoubtedly the devoted women who cour-
ageously wore the primal reds and greens, or blues
and purples, of some male friend who urged a gee-
gee in the gentlemen-riders’ race. By the way, I
have a bilious memory of one lady at a former
meeting, attired in bright yellow silk and black
lace, like a gentle fall of soot on a butter-firkin,
who explained her brilliancy by walking with
a youth carrying a bag and a horsewhip to let the
lawn know that he was the identical Tommy
Hales who ran first at the wrong end of the
amachaw flutter. That is the tiresome part about
the non-professional—he asserts his metier so, A
real jockey, when hi* work is over, straddles on
to the stand looking like an ordinary citizen
sadly in want of a square meal, whereas a painted
rider catches his spurs in your back draperies for
the rest of the entertainment.
Nearly all the women were in muslin. Mrs.
(Dr.) Molyneux wore a flowery flimsy shaded by a
Paris parasol; Miss Garran also wore an airy fabric,
and contrasted pink flowers with a folded bodice
of pale-blue surah; Miss Caro’s toilet of ecru
muslin, trimmed with white ribbon, and a rustic
hat with yellow daffodils on it, might be safely
copied by the brunette brigade, and Miss
McDonagh’s dress was a conspicuously good tit.
But a society matron, of diminished inches,
who paraded the lawn, unwisely wore one of the
double skirts that are only possible on bean-pole
women, and make one-storey belledom look
like the mythical person who walked across
the seas, and wore his two legs right down to the
knees. Even on a lump of a girl they look teles-
copic, and you really can’t help wondering what
would be the vista if the lower lens, so to speak,
shut up suddenly like a demoralised spring blind.
The charming Mdlle. Bartho —in a foreign
gown of Indian-red bengaline covered for the most
part with black chiffon embroidered with black
silk guipure—small bonnet in rainbow colours—
was the cynosure of the Members’, where I had a
little pow-wow with her. Bartho owns to 21, and
seen by daylight is a fresh, nicely-mannered girl
without a spot of make-up. Her lingo isaqueer olla
podrida of Russian, Italian, French and English.
“Ilikee Australee,” she said beamingly—which
is only fair, for Australia certainly adores her.
Bartho (her real name, by-the-way) is Russian
on her mother’s side and English on her father’s,
and has an evidently sparkling sister who lives in
Moscow and who, having married a Russian
prince, dances only when she pleases. The snow-
flake Bartho herself shrugs her shoulders and looks
mildly panic-stricken if you mention marriage as a
personal possibility. “Pairhaps in six—seven—
ate year I maree, but not yet, I do adore my
art,” She doesn’t consider, by-the-way, that we
have seen her art in Australia, and she makes a
“mouth” when you mention the butterfly ballet
in “Beauty.” Ballets d’action are her strong point,
where there is something besides dancing to be
done; and these would catch on tremendously here,
she says, though in slightly more broken language.
After a brief appearance in Melbourne, Bartho
leaves Sydney for Chicago—thence to London (a
city she chuckles at the mention of, “for ze ladies
and gentlemen do clap so”) and then round
Russia. Her many admirers will be glad to hear
that she intends revisiting Australia after the
engagements hereinbefore alluded to are wiped off
the slate.
The return to the palpitating bosom of Bara-
tarian society of a handsome and tuneful lawyer
who went abroad avowedly to pursue the vocation
of a singing man, has set people agog. Did he
fail utterly or was he discouraged by the unsympa-
thetic professor telling him in vqlgar gutturals
that he vas goot for de third row of de gorus ? Or,
was it that he could see all but his glossy mous-
tache on the shrine of Polyhymnia ? Everybody
is simply dying to know !
But I always sigh relievedly on hearing of any
amateur giving up the stage as a bad job ; for so
few succeed in the paths of mimicry. Society
girls, in shoals, make the fatal plunge—recite a
brief line in a curtain-raiser—don’t set the South
Pacific on fire, and retire to a somewhat anomalous
social position, being neither flesh, fowl nor good
red herring—and I want to know why they persist
in doing it ?
If girls must go on the stage or explode from
bottled-up genius, they should follow the example
of a Sydney society girl who has pocketed tier
yearning to pose in long speeches and snipped
frocks from her debut, and has started by snipping
the other pole—or poles, I suppose I should say—
of her person, and stoically learning the rudiments
from the point of view of the ballet.
Talking of Society would-be actresses, there is
one tall and rather nice girl somewhere in Aus-
tralia who has failed to make even a chalk-mark
on the portal of success, and who feels that Fate
is to blame, and not the stiffness of her knee-
joints. “ I ought to succeed,” she said to a sym-
pathetic friend recently; “I am just the same
height as Mary Anderson !” This suggests a new
reason for the stage-struck girl to give her aston-
ished parent when she tells him solemnly that the
theatre is her mission and she must go. “Papa,
my back view is exactly like Sarah Bernhardt’s.”
They speak of themselves as “we actresses” —
their private pose is tremendously professional-
needing, perhaps, to keep up the histrionic
interest which doesn’t get a chance of being fed
by the footlights. I was speaking (in Melbourne)
to one of these half-baked actresses the other day,
with the powder showering off her nose, and a
sort of general challenge about her to encourage
people to nudge other people and inquire—“ Who
is she?” She —considerably over seven—left an
intellectual and, at the same time, “society” home
for the genteel-comedy line, starting forth as a
full-blown utility in a tea-gown, without learning
the names of the ropes, so to speak. Not being a
heaven-born genius, the laurels didn’t eventuate.
Now she rusts by the wayside, a would-be Essie
Jenyns, who doesn’t get a chance of going “on ”
with “ a letter for your ladyship,” even.
Tradespeople who suffer from valueless cheques
may get a pointer from the proceedings of three
Sydney men who galvanised an absolutely dead
bit of paper into life up the line, the other day.
The leading conspirator was Figs, a well-known
grocer, upon whom a pleasure-resort hotel-man
had passed a valueless cheque for goods received.
Figs and two sportive friends, signing themselves
Figs & Co., travelled to the hostelry and spent a
gorgeous week—gunning, driving and utilizing all
the pleasure-forces of the establishment. At last
the day of reckoning—and the climax—when
Figs threw the landlord’s own valueless cheque
drawn in favour of Figs & Co. “Pay you in
your own coin, old man,” he said, pointedly,
“ And I’ll take a receipt, please!” The publican
gets his sugar from the other shop now.
I hear that a widowed Baratarian Bishop is en*
gaged to a rich widow whose estates lie south-
ward.
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Melbourne, January 30th.
A Presbyterian millionaire, lately deceased, was
in his old age a squalid miser, with an obtrusive
cough and a rag-bag taste in dress. Like Tenny-
son’s “Dora,” he “lived unmarried till his
death,” though long ago, when young and not yet
asthmatic, he was once on the point of matri-
mony. When the furniture was bought, and the
feast spread, the lady changed her mind. It was
one of those rare cases in which the maiden can’t
bring herself to the scratch. - The bridegroom-
castaway bore her defection calmly, but he never
felt equal to sacrificing, at half-price, certain
antimacassars and feminine fal-lals, which, covered
with half-a-century’s dust, lumber up his house
to this day, unless the heirs-at-law have already
celebrated their good fortune by a bonfire in the
backyard.
This bygone romance seemed to harden the old
man’s heart towards youthful lovers, and a
favourite kinsman was cut off with a shilling on
confessing that he had plighted his troth to a
nymph engaged in the drapery trade. Perhaps
it was the expense of a wooing in the family that
the millionaire objected to ; for upon hearing,
three weeks before his death, that the young
couple had gone for a picnic, taking by way of
provisions 30s. worth of sweets and the same value
of liquids, he altered his will. The disinherited,
now a boundary-rider, weeps bitter tears over the
bare mention of chocolate - creams and De
Castella’s white hermitage.
At a recent Exhibition concert Lalla Miranda,
in pink, with cheeks to match, was more than
usually winsome. Bessie Doyle, too, looked
handsome, but there is something “ slap-dash ” in
this young artiste’s platform manner, a sort of “if
you don’t like me, do the other thing ” air. It
must impress the other sex, however, for after
Bessie’s Queensland tour, several “ Banana boys ”
left their mothers’ apron-strings and followed
down here, at the risk of typhoid, not to mention
tram accidents and the chance of being put on a
“B” list of contributaries, merely to hear the
enchantress once more in Mendelssohn’s concerto.
An advantage of promenade concerts is that you
are not bound to one spot. For instance, when a
well-advertised book-vendor refreshed himself
with ham-sandwiches the other night, his imme-
diate neighbours thought that, the heat being
intense, he might have perambulated during the
repast. As he didn’t, they did.
Mr. Gillies’ party, fully “war-painted,’’dropped
in late in a friendly way. Chairs, noisily shunted
to the front by amateur lion-hunters, were not
accepted. Later on, Mr, G. was heard to remark
that he’d had “a splendid shilling’s-worth (he is
Scotch); better than all the theatres.” Also, the
great man announced, in a stage-whisper, that he
wasn't going direct to England, which I take to be
political intelligence of tlje first water. Between
ourselves, I believe he funks his official entry into
London, and dreads the thought of having the
starch taken out of him.
Every dawg has his day, and a dull, little town
in the centre of our toniest squattocracy is having
quite a matrimonial boom at present. Once the
sole excitement lay in wondering who would carry
off the belle of the district, the tall, fair daughter
of a first family. In due course matters arranged
themselves most disappointingly for local com-
petitors, though quite to the satisfaction of a
British importation. One of the mourners is as
gilded a spark as can be, who could scarcely grow
poor if he wanted to; money being epidemic in
his clan. The mighty have their trials no less
than the humble, as I thought when I saw twins,
in an emblazoned perambulator, at a Toorak
garden-party. Another of the unfortunates is at
present deriving such solace as may be afforded
by the presence of vice-regality in his parental
mansion. But that doesn’t count for much nowa-
days, for only last week the fellow-sufferer (before
referred to) sustained a similar honour without
seeming a bit the better for it.
Another resident of the same district, whose
home, so far as scenery goes, answers closely to
Claude Melnotte’s palace by the Lake of Como, is
about to introduce an Eve into his Paradise.
Apropos of the last-mentioned engagement,
mothers shouldn’t worry their girls over Latin and
Euclid. They should have them taught to sing.
The trill of the nightingale in even the simplest
summer plumage brings man to his knees quicker
than anything, except looks, of course—a per-
sonal fascination which can’t be acquired by close
study. A fine voice runs a voluptuous outline
very close for the Hymen stakes. Needless to re-
mark, atrocities of the “ Me love who loved me
sow ” description won’t answer the purpose; let
the performance be first-class or attempt it not.
That reminds me of the “ twang.” In my
humble opinion, if it’s your nature to twang
you’ll do so whether you come from Cork or Cook-
town. Take Lord Hopetoun, for instance. He
enquires after one’s health in this fashion:

His Excellency is still up country enacting
his favourite rcile of free-and-easy sort of
fellow, ready to turn his hand to anything. ( At
one station he burned to do some cattle-drafting,
and was given the opportunity, which he enjoyed

having been specially chosen for the occasion, were
old milkers, adult pet calves, and similar bovine
types, of habits so domesticated and conventional
that a Carlton barraoker couldn’t have found any-
thing in their behaviour to swear at.
Last night at the Princess’ Panto. D’Argo
appeared utterly knocked up by the heat, while
her set smile was even more anxious than usual.
When she wriggles over into a corner and tips up,
D’Argo rather looks like a hen scratching in the
dust, and amuses the youngsters more than any-
thing, which is not a difficult achievement in
“ Bed Riding Hood.” Pantomimes don’t seem to
appeal to children now, whatever they may have
done once. Last night, before the performance
was half over, two weary infants near me were
digging their elbows into their mother and teazing
to know when she’d take them to the circus.
The Post-office employes are nerving themselves
in readiness for a dire calamity. Their pic-nic
down the Bay is nearly due, and as on the
appointed date the P.M.G. will be entertaining
some salt of the earth at his station, they are
afraid he won’t be able to get away. It takes a
civil servant, seemingly, to fathom the depth of
a misfortune like this. A postal water-picnic
without the P.M.G. on board might manage to
struggle along pretty well, you would think, but
there is a craving in the soul of a letter-carrier
which only the head of the department can
appease.
The “ ennobled ” Shenton, with wife and chil-
dren, nurses, and all the pomps incidental to
knighthood, is on his way back to Albany.
Times have transmogrified since Shenton the
elder, a substantial storekeeper, was “ kept in his
place” by the superior, but impecunious, land-
holders of W. Australia. Young George had to
order himself lowly and reverently to all his
betters, and went regularly to the Wesleyan
Sunday-school for his only recreation. When
his sister, a very pretty girl, became en-
gaged to the son of an “old family” it
was deemed a gorgeous stroke of luck
for the daughter of a—Oh ! dear —tradesman in
the first place, and for her people, who would
participate m the glory of the alliance. However,
the poor girl was drowned before her wedding-
day, and the Shentons went on prospering with-
out anyone’s help. To this day the haughty slow-
goers of Perth can’t realise that George Shen-
ton has made enough money to qualify him for
a K.C.M.G., and they resent his “ greatness”
right down to their boots.
What has become of all the Sabbatarians ? I’ve
been expecting an outbreak ever since Gov. Hope-
toun’s party tooled a four-in-hand into Hamilton

as coolly as if there wasn’t a Hereafter in the
bowels of the earth. Evidently an earl and a
Scotchman can do no wrong, otherwise the Presby-
terian Assembly would have issued a manifesto
before now. Looking at the Hopetoun incident
dispassionately, I think it was a shade wickeder
than Gov. Duff’s treatment of the Caledonian
beanfeast. A Gov’ment ’Ouse orderly endorsed
this opinion by committing suicide the other
afternoon. They said the warm weather, or some-
thing, had preyed upon the poor man’s mind, but I
believe it was his noble master’s Sunday conduct
that drove him to self-destruction.
Mrs. Snodgrass, the mother-in-law of Millionaire

The announcement of her death set the old identi-

girl, bent on jogging through life at the side of
genial Peter Snodgrass, despite a certain amount
of parental opposition, which she took very easily,
knowing that the objectors had themselves, in
their time, made a runaway match.

George Rignold’s new drama, “True as
Steel,” is almost too large for serious criticism.
There is truly enormous amount of it for the
money. For something like four hours it goes by
with a whiz and a roar and a wild dazzle, and
never lets up once on its oppressive gorgeousness.
There is an unfortunate resemblance to the
“ Silver King ”in three or four places; the hero,
like Wilfred Denver, is charged with the murder
he didn’t commit, and becomes fabulously rich in
“Jfurrin parts,” and instead of returning in dis-
guise, a silver king, he comes back, by way of
utterly reckless originality, in disguise as a dia-
mond king. Then, like Denver, he fixes himself
up as a deaf and utterly stupid night-watchman,
but by way of more originality he is watchman at
a foundry instead of at a wharf. There is a big
realistic steam hammer in the drama which some-
how fails to come down on Mr. Roberts’ head;
and a big, realistic water-wheel which goes steadily
round with a slimy, squashy persistence, while
George Rignold, with a drowned girl in his arms,
hangs on to it, and the two are hoisted up into
the unknown, the girl’s wet hair getting into
George’s mouth and hanging over his ears.
Further, there is an undressed young man, blush-
ing behind an umbrella—a young man whose
father has pawned his clothes for beer while the
offspring was doing a 500 yards spurt; and there
is a drowning girl underneath the floor of an old
mill, and a blast furnace, and a riot, and many
other things.

The moral of this big drama evidently is
that when the good, honest, humble, non-union
blackleg saves the life of his employer from
the wicked “ walking delegate,” the employer
shall straightway round on him and get him a
long term of penal servitude. Therefore, The
Bulletin’s sympathies are mostly with the wicked
walking delegate, who is represented by Frank
Harcourt, toiling manfully at the steam hammer,
and vainly trying to bring it down on Mr. Roberts’
head. Mir. Rignold’s “King of Diamonds ”is an

effective and vigorous character, though the old-
time Henry V. now begins to look a good deal
more like Henry VIII. Miss Virginia Vivienne
is oast for a pathetic dying woman, and is—with
one exception—the only dying woman this paper
remembers at present who dies without being
more or less ridiculous, and weeps over her
hungry little daughter without growing maudlin.
About fourteen other characters live by the sweat
of their brows in various parts of the drama.
Messrs. Sweeney, Plimmer, and Ambrose, Miss
Watts Phillips, the hungry little daughter afore-
said, and a new and promising actress described
as Miss Agnes Bristowe are all deserving of
encouragement. The scenery is excellent, and
among the tremendous mechanical effects the only
thing which went wrong the first night was a
rather unmanageable coal-mine. This appliance
nearly fell on the head of Mr. Plimmer, and the
voice of Henry V. could be heard using strong
language in the bowels of the earth as a conse-
quence. Then Henry V. came up sideways—
because the cage refused to come up straight—and
looked as if he would have gladly eaten the
orphan if she had been anywhere about.

“Beauty and the Beast,” at Sydney
Lyceum, ends on Saturday, after a run of success
which ought to warm the copious shirt-front of
the management. George Lauri announces that
he will make his last appearance in Sydney on the
same night, and Friday evening is devoted to this
clever and gushing gentleman’s farewell benefit,
when sundry new songs and jokes will be put on
in honour of the occasion. With the end of the
panto, the adorable Bartho also vanishes over
the.rim of the Australian horizon, and the know-
ledge of this desolating disappearance makes an
atmosphere of bereavement about the Lyceum
show, and even the ticket-taker looks like one who
sorrows without hope and refuses to be com-
forted.

The beer advt., and the tomato-sauce
announcement, and the dry gin intimation con-
tinue in the best of health on the Sydney Royal
drop-scene, but the strangler is gone, and “The
Cannon’s Mouth ” yawns instead. This is a good,
serious, stereotyped drama of unobjectionable
morality. In the beginning the defaulting guar-
dian hoarsely bids his ward to go to her room,
and never look upon the face of her lover —a sad-
looking parson with a long nose —any more, and
she goes obediently. Whereupon the lost pocket-
book is found on the person of the lover—or,
rather, the drunken ruffian with the pro-
jecting tooth says that he found it there; and,
these events having happened in Ireland, the
lover is hauled away and court-inartialled in
Upper Egypt, where the wicked captain ties him
to a gun on his own undivided responsibility, and
proposes to blow him up. But, owing to the fact
that the Irish lady is hidden under the sofa while
the captain and the person with the protruding
tobth are forging the death- warrant, and that she
drugs the captain with nearly a quart of laudanum,
the lieutenant escapes in a balloon, and, falling in
the desert, he finds the minion with the tooth
dying on the red sand alongside a drome-
dary’s skeleton, and the minion confesses
all, and the lieutenant walks back to Khar-
toum and blasts the captain by saying that
the other man had said the captain is an
awful character. This scene takes place in a nice
English cottage at Khartoum with green oleo-
graphs on the wall. Finally, the captain is led
away foaming impotently, and presumably he is
blown up with dynamite and goes down to meet
his accomplice and snarl at him among the coals.
The whole episode of the captain’s downfall only
lasts three minutes, and then the condensed milk
advt. falls upon an unfinished-looking story that
seems to end nowhere in particular.
• • •
The most hopeless features of the play are
the cottage at Khartoum and, the removal of the
lieutenant all the way from Ireland to be tried in
Upper Egypt, and the balloon, which is flabby
and unconvincing, and the fact that the minion
seems to have started to walk from Khartoum
back to Ireland, which no man with brains enough
to be a minion would attempt. Also, the perse-
cuted lieutenant, as represented by Mr. Westma-
cott, looks too heavenly to be a lieutenant ;
and the Times correspondent is an obvious
imbecile who is perpetually looking for
his spectacles in the thick of battle,
and is an insult to a profession which
generally knows when to come in out of the
wet. Mr. Walton, as the traditional stagey
Irishman, and* the pretty and graceful Mrs.
Hayman are two distinctly redeeming features,
and there are good points about the wicked cap-
tain and the minion. Possibly it was owing to
them, or, perhaps, it was because of the balloon,
that there wasn’t standing-room at the Royal pn
Saturday night, or any night since. If the
management could put a little more vigour into
the war it would be a good thing for the drama,
that murderous upheaval being represented at
present by something that sounds like the drop-
ping of a four times in the wings.

Manager Williamson, it is whispered, will
appear once more as John Stofel shortly after his
return from foreign parts, in fact, he and partner
Musgrove, runs the story, have as good as engaged
himself to star in “ Struck Oil.” The play which
Williamson bought, adapted, copyrighted every
Where he went (save only in N.S.W.), and made his
fortune with is having another boom. A “ Struck
QiP’company toured the English provinces not long
ago. Only the other day Frank Sanger, of New
York, got a lease of the American rights from#
J.O.W. with a view to sending thismascotte show
around the States for about the fifth time. There-
fore, it is naturally assumed that “Struck Oil,”
conducted by the real original Dutch father, ought
to presently accomplish another “ knock” in Mel-
bourne, where they have never seen any Stofel
but Williamson, and don’t want to. Which re-
minds one that people are equally conservative as
regards Lizzie Stofel. If all the glory of “Struck
Oil ” is to be revived, and Maggie Moore is to
play her original character—well, in that case the
.Princess's would become the Mecca pro, tern, of
all faithful playgoers.

Several youthful pantomimists concealed
in “ property ” characters, at Melb. Princess’,
have shown a fearful determination to do some-
thing since The Bulletin conferred a notice upon
them. But as the gun wants to get in front of the
telescope, and the telescope is suspected of sinister
designs against the gun’s equilibrium, and seeing
that the fishing-float is damaging his fragile
environment in a mad pursuit of celebrity, nob to
mention the frantic behaviour of a black, naked
doll who has begun to “ gag ” his part by turning
a catherine-wheel (and who, being uncertain in
his movements, may presently land upon the
shaven head of Lovell Phillips and kill that
imposing conductor ere he be fit and seasoned
for the passage)—taking all these things into
consideration, The Bulletin is somewhat sorry
that it spoke. Caiecedo was out of the per-
formance through indisposition on Saturday; and
certain johnnies were heard proclaiming that the
gymnast had strained his back, and would never
turn somersaults upon the wire again. But this
information had no more truth in it, perhaps,
than the contemporary story that Premier Patter-
son had demised. A second edition of “ Red Rid-
ing Hood” is not distinguishable from the first
edition, except that a silvery waterfall near the
wolf’s lair, or some such place, is less like a water-
fall, and more like a fairy’s trimmings flapping
from a curtain roller, than it used to be. The
panto, will last another week or two. Then “The
Gondoliers.”

The Royal will also continue to pay ex-
penses and a bit over—some say a good deal over
—until Feb. 10th, for certain. A wonderful
achievement, considering that “Sinbad” looked
like a lost cause before it had run a fortnight. A
lesson in pluck and perseverance. Maggie Moore’s
abundant talent and energy have been well
backed up by Martyn Hagan, a name little known
in Melbourne. Hagan’s songs were not very
popular at the outset, yet he pegged away at them
until ho got encores. His encore verses were up
to date, and he sang them for all they were worth,
and made a small amount of voice go a consider-
able way. For the matter of which, everything
at the Royal, little or big, has been made the most
of, and that’s how Bill Adams won the Battle of
Waterloo.

The rag-and-bone drama was continued
over Saturday, although its prospects for the
present week were not dazzling. Dan Barry claims
credit for a meritorious entertainment at the
prices, and his claim holds good as regards every-
thing except the play in this case. He could get
much better things made up from old printed
plays for a modest .£lO apiece, and the result
would be quite as original as the cheap horrors
now presented. On Saturday next the bill is to
be “First Class,” or so the advt. says.

The Wild Cat Column.
The Commercial Banking 00. of Sydney
presents by far the best balance-sheet of all the
re-constructed banks —in fact, one of the best in
Australasia. It has a reserve fund of £1,010,000,
and available cash of over two millions, while Gov-
ernment securities and other immediately realis-
able assets amount to more than another million. The
profits for the half-year are £67,469, 6f which £34,795 goes
to pay a div. at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum, and
£33,000 is added to the bank’s reserves. The Commercial of
Sydney is, with one exception, the strongest of the purely
Australian banks, and its prospects are probably better
now than at any previous period of its career.
• tt •
The Royal Bank of Queensland earns .£6400 for
the half-year—equal to rather less than five per cent, per
annum—but in view of the stormy nature of the times no
dividend is declared, and the whole amount is carried
forward.

The English, Scottish and Australian gives
six months’ notice of it* Intention to pay oft the
terminable deposit-receipts which were issued in lieu of
current accounts in the old bank. The six months* notice
is required by the terms of the reconstruction, but any
terminable deposit-holder can get his money at once
upon application. The amount to be thus paid off
represents one-fourth of the current accounts of the old
Chartered Bank.
tt • •
The balance-sheet of the Queensland National
Bank shows a net profit for the half-year of £12,910, equal
to a trifle less than 5 per cent, per annum on capital.
There is no div. The Q.N.B. has no reserve-fund now,
and its entire paid-up capital is £543,082. Considering
the exceedingly small amount on which divs. have to be
darned, and the enormous business done by the Q.N., in
proportion to its size, the results are not particularly
cheering. The available reserve in coin, bullion and
Treasury notes is equal to about 12 per cent, on liabilities.
But the most striking feature about the Q.N.B. balance-
sheet is the dreadfully non-committal character of the
auditors’ certificate. The last balance-sheet was attested
by the auditors with so many elaborate saving clauses
that these gentlemen made themselves in no way
responsible for the bank’s solvency or anything else
connected with it, and on the present occasion they
are almost equally cautious. “We certify,” they say,
“ that, in our opinion, the above balance-sheet is a full
and fair one, exhibiting a true statement of the affairs of
the bank, as shown by the books on 21st December 1893.”
“As shown by the books ” makes the auditors’
certificate abso'-utely worthless as a safeguard for the
shareholders and depositors. Almost all balance-sheets,
from that cf the Bank of France, or the Bank of England,
down to the gruesome documents of the Mercantile and
Federal Banks and the Abigail pawnshop, are, and
always were, all right “ as shown by the books.” The
assurance that the Q.N.B.’s accounts are likewise is as
void of interest as the assurance that it is going to be wet
when it rains. The question at issue—the question above
all others which the auditors are (or should be) paid to
answer—is whether the books themselves are all right.
And the auditors of the Q.N.8., in two successive balance-
sheets, have carefully inserted a saving clause which
practically disclaims all responsibility for the books.
Also, they do not even say that they have counted the
cash, or examined, or valued, or so much as seen, the
securities. They merely say, baldly, that the figures in
the balance-sheet are the same as those in the books,
therefore if the books are all right the balance-sheet is
right, and if the books happen to represent bad or doubt-
ful or depreciated securities or unreliable overdrafts as
good, then the sheet does likewise.
One depressing feature, common to all bank
balance-sheets, is that bald item, “ Bills receivable and
all other debts due to the bank,” which generally forms
three-fourths of the assets. This item never reads “all
other good debts due to the bank,” therefore directors
may, without committing themselves to any dangerous
statements, make it include almost anything. The
average balance-sheet, in fact, doesn’t even profess to
assert, in any definite language, that the bank is solvent,
and the average auditor, as a rule, doesn’t assert it very
strongly. The Q. N. Bank auditors, however, don’t assert
it at all—in fact, they don’t assert anything.
Another feature which may, or may not, have
some significance, is the statement in the profit and loss
account that provision has been made “for bad debts,” &c.
This item generally reads that provision has been made
“ for had and doubtful debts,” and the Q.N. Bank’s state-
ment is either an unlucky clerical error or else it means
that doubtful debts have not been provided for and are
still included among the assets. Considering how many
debts are doubtful these times, and how exceedingly
doubtful many of them are, this item, like a lot of others,
would be improved by a little clearness.

politician to whom the country may look for advice ; a
sound man of business, &c. Read the wild nonsense he
talked when he assumed the chairmanship of that same

The Perpetual Trustee Co, of Sydney has now
become a steady dividend-paying institution. Its busi-
ness is to supply a reasonably safe and reliable
substitute for that utterly unreliable solicitor or private
trustee, who generally either loses the widow’s mite and
the orphan’s patrimony backing doubles for the Cup, or
else eats them up in costs, or else simply collects all the
trust money, and puts a lying notice on the door that
he will be back in ten minutes, and then departs for
Bolivia or Honduras, and is seen no more. The Perpetual
Trustee Co. (and another Sydney co. in the same line of
business—the Permanent Trustees) does everything that
the unreliable family solicitor or private trustee has
hitherto done, at a much cheaper rate, and its large
unpaid capital and long list of wealthy shareholders make
its sudden and dishonest vanishment to Bolivia abso-
lutely impossible. The progress of the institution has
been slow owing to the obstinate conservatism of the
public, but its 6 per cent, dividend and the substantial

progressing and will soon become a solid success.

Slow-going Sydney has got well in at Cosl-

Sydney at 7s. 6d. Now the United Coolgardie, entirely a

that one of their leases, Ritanita, is the best show he has
seen on the field outside of Bayley’s. The big reef, on
which work has been started, is six to seven feet wide,
and he is satisfied it will average fully 10oz.
• # #
Bibby on Coolgardie : “It is going to be a
great goldfield, probably one of the richest on earth ; but
there are a terrible lot of leases taken up that are not
worth the first year’s rent. There are men here repre-
senting Melb. and Adelaide syndicates who do nothing
but drink whisky and spend money in the town.
Others I met on the road who have not been sober enough
to reach the field yet.”

Bibby writes of Bayley’s Reward : “It is a
wonderful mine, and the way it is being opened up is a
credit to manager Begelhoie. There are several years’
work for a large crushing plant in sight, and there is no
doubt about the gold being in the stone. They have
proved the rich shoot of gold to be over 200 feet in
length without a break. This has been done by drives
along the course of the reef, and levels are going away at
100 feet. The gold is not only in rich veins, but is distri-
buted throughout the whole of the reef.”

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHEAT IS IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad article for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you ? Will you do j our business at

The editor of a Sydney daily refused for

Count Tolstoi, a nephew of “ Kreutzer

Thomas Finney, the big Brisbane draper,
whose “ commission ticket ” on the .£lO invested

The Australee man who, for the second time,
lately levanted with a certain plump pantomime
actress, is now in gaol for wife-desertion. He was
a good and righteous man, and a pillar of his
church. The morning he left home to elope with
his own true love he turned to his wife and said :
“ I have a few minutes to spare before my train is

The presence of the two Parkes in N.S.W.
Legislative Assembly is not a singular instance in
Australasia of father and son occupying seats in
the same legislature. Two Hutchinsons — p&re et
fils—were members of Maoriland Parliament in
’B5, likewise the two Reeves ; while F. Whitaker
and his clever son, F. A. Whitaker, were both
members of the preceding M.L. legislature.
Adelaide Hebrew congregation, though it
owes only .£2OO and possesses an unencumbered
property worth .£BOOO to .£lO,OOO, has, according
to the Hebrew Times, reduced its minister’s
salary to £3OO a year, “a very poor return for his
life’s service, amounting to 25 years.” Probably
the first instance on record of an Australian
Jewish congregation being mean to its pastor.
Lord Sherbrooke is to Patchett Martin
what King Charles’ head was to Mr. Dick. In

sequence—will be pleased to hear that one of the
N.S.W. electorates has been named after white-

An English lecturer who has just finished
a highly profitable tour in Australia “to men
only” and “women only,” was, 12 years ago, a
poorly-paid Presbyterian parson in the North of
Scotland. How well he gauged his prospects,
of making money out of goody-goodies who
hoped to hear something “ blue,” is proved by the
fact that he clears .£450!) as the result of six

Little Dr. Maloney’s professional announce*
ment on the front of a house in Spring-street,
Melb., is followed by the intimation —“Political
budness before 10 a.m. at” (private address).
The notion of an M.L. A. inviting all and sundry
to discuss “ political business ” with him before 10
in -the morning strikes one as droll. But Malo-
ney’s constituents are not humorous. Moreover,
the loss of a month’s wages is no joking matter
for the suspended engine-greaser, who breaks in
upon the surgeon’s breakfast, and desires him to
put the case before the country. “ Political busi-
ness ” is a comprehensive term in Victoria.

Certain “ society ” circles sit in astonish-
ment when Mr. Arthur Galton, Gov. Duff’s private
secretary, handles his knife and fork. Several
people believe firmly that his stomach is “ all
wrong,” while others think him an epicure whose
beef is never done to the turn that pleases him.
All that ails Mr. Galton, however, is that he is a
vegetarian, but doesn’t care to explain himself to
every host and hostess.
Old N.S.W. Parliamentary hands are not
prone to judge Minister Copeland harshly with
the scenes in previous Parliaments unforgotten.
For instance, there was the statesman who takes
a large size in hats, and the episode when he used
hi? hat as an extinguisher by pressing it violently
over the head and on the shoulders of a verbose
supporter. And yet Hindle, M.P., is a strong
follower of the above statesman with the large
head.
Bishop Kennion, of Adelaide, is indignant
at the suggestion that his late visit to England
was for the purpose of seeing whether brother-in-
law Sir James Fergusson, M.P., could put any-
thing gilded in his way. He alleges that he has
had many good offers, but has rejected them all in
order to save Anglican souls in South Australia.
It was Kennion who so sadly delayed Saumarez
Smith’s elevation to the Primacy, which he wanted
himself.

Augustus Morris, one of Sydney’s Bank-

N.S.W. Parliament under responsible Govt.)
claims to have taught several American ladies to
speak English without nasal “twang.” This was

who complain that Mr. Morris’s own “twang,”
when expatiating on Federation or Freetrade
politics, detracts greatly from the intrinsic merit
of his ideas.
Parkes, in a despondent humour, one day
lately, spoke of Death as his greatest friend. In a
political sense the remark is true. The men of the
last thirty years, who were best able to contend
against him, one alter another passed away.
Often, when confronted with insurmount-
able difficulties, Parkes has dropped his hands
to his sides and waited, and surely enough
death came along and carried off the most danger-
ous of his opponents.
Ex-Premier Parkes, in his anxiety to cast
discredit upon Frank Suttor, recently alluded to
the latter’s father, the late W. H. Suttor, as “the
founder of the family.” Now, the founder of the
Suttor family in N.S. Wales was a colonist who
arrived free in the early part of the century, and
settled at Baulkham Hills. He was the grand-
father of Frank Suttor, and went to England to.

I have much pleasure in testifying to the great

About six months ago I was a great sufferer from
neuralgia, I tried various remedies without being
relieved, I was recommended to try Clements
Tonic, and found (before I had finished the third

J. F. Burns, once N.S. Wales Colonial
Treasurer, indefatigably works his searchlight to
discover a friendly constituency. But difficulties
grow day by day in every quarter of the land for

A Maryborough (Q.) paper :
Visitors to Bundaberg are strongly advised to ride first-
class. At the present time, the trains are crammed with
filthy Chinamen and Kanakas, many of them breaking
out in ulcerous sores ; and the effluvia arising from them
is simply abominable.

Mrs. Mary Lee, the chief S.A. adult-
suffragist, has been asked to seek election to the
Legislative Council. She declined, however, in
loyalty to the constitution of her union, which sets
forth "that, for the present, the right to sit in
Parliament shall not be sought by women. Why
not ?
The agitation, covertly but strenuously
maintained, for the release of Abigail, Howe, and
Frank Smith, ex-M’s.P., exclusive of other similar
offenders, was described by a N.S.W. Minister
of the Crown, the other day, as the inspiration of
unconvicted politicians on behalf of convicted
ones.
“Tit for tat,” saida N.S.W. Upper House
legislator one day last week, when questioned on
apolitical point. “Tat,” he explained, “means

Rights Purchase Bill ” (Colo Valley water-power
grab). “The Assembly doing tat, and the Coun-
cil tit.”
Gillies is proud to think that his numerous
Ballarat friends have been watching his successes
with pleasure since 1868, when he ceased to repre-
sent a local constituency. Ballarat must be easily
pleased at that rate. Most people have noted the
consistent failures of the calamitous log-roller
with disgust.
John Haynes on the wild, irresponsible
stump ; “ I will give you the right to go and mine
on any land by virtue of your miner’s right.”
Therefore, the writer is going to invest in a
miner’s right, and sink one shaft in John’s front
garden and another in his back-yard by way of
corroborating John’s own statement.
The idiocy of the honorary-magistrate
system cannot be better illustrated than by the
fact that in Melbourne alone there are seven J .’sP.
who have made private compositions, three living
in open immorality with women other than their
wives, 18 either owners of or directly interested
in public-houses, and three pawnbrokers.
Parkes hopes to live to see the votes of
persons on the electoral rolls collected through the
post on coupons. The collecting of the views of
the people he considers a State duty ; and the
fact that some people will not go out of their way
to vote only makes it, according to his idea, the
more necessary for the State to meet them on their
own terms.
Cabled that the Imperial Institute, despair-
ing of otherwise attracting the public, has opened a
bar for the sale of Australian wine. After all,
good red wine is the real “crimson thread of kin-
ship.” Seeing that it cost .£500,000, and the
“immense personal efforts” of Wales and £ £
Smith, the 1.1, may fairly claim to be the most
expensive wine-shop on earth.
Jack Want, ex-N.S.W. Attorney-General
(who always spends most of his holidays amongst
niggers), told a Maoriland interviewer that he is
disgusted with politics, and intends to retire and
breed canaries in private life. Pact is some of the
public read it this way : “Jack wants to be
Premier.” He would like it to read this way :
“ Jack Want’s to be Premier.”
The standing army of each Australian __
province, remarks a Bulletin correspondent, is"
but a threat to strikers, a means to “ brandy up ”
an unscrupulous Minister to some deed of class
favouritism, a school for perpetrating Jingo tradi-
tions, a platform to air nobodies otherwise in the
back rows of oblivion, a nest of Imperial cocka-
trices, a genealogical link between convictism and
slavery.
If the anarchist proceedings were treated
with proper contempt they might be quenched.
These fellows get all they want in the prodigious
glorification afforded by the newspapers. As soon
as another outrage comes into a newspaper office
the editor trembles with horror and writes —“ On
this joyful—we mean melancholy occasion.” Ob-
viously the way to deal with these things is by
chopping off the glorification.
In the English Reform Bill of over half a
century ago, John Stuart Mill inserted “person ”
for “ man ” as possessor of the franchise. Mill
was then a Radical and Atheistical Freethinker,
and a counting of Parliamentary noses in Aus-
tralia lately shows that over 80 percent, of the
members who are outside of the prevalent faiths,
political and religious, all favour a similar change
in existing Australian electoral laws.
That vvildly-irresponsible teetotaller, G, D.
Clark, M L.A. (N.S.W.), asserts that “statistics
prove beyond all doubt that 100,000 persons are
killed by whisky where one person is killed by a
mad dog.” Statistics don’t prove anything of the
kind. Taking all the countries from which statis-
tics are available, about 40 in every million deaths
are caused by mad dogs. Therefore, even if every
other death were caused by whisky there could
only be 25,000 times as many deaths from liquor
as from dog-bite. There is no reckless per verier
of statistics on earth to compare with the teeto-
taller.
“ Wherever my

Says Sydney

regulations.” The
TELEGRAPHhas afixed
idea that everything
which goes wrong in
this world, down to
snakes and large blue
flies, is owing some-
how to Protection.
The trouble between
Canadaand the States
was at its worst over
a century ago, when
Montgomery and Ar-

Quebec, and when
there was no border
tariff at all. And
now that there is a
tariff on both sides of
the line a large party
in Canada votes for
peaceful annexation

Telegraph can, no

Freetrade principles,
that this can’t pos-
sibly be, but it is, all
the same.
Says a grovelsome Melbourne editor .
“ There is not a single colony strong enough to be
independent of the British Government, neither
is there a colonial Premier capable of administering
the affairs of the colony without the ad vice and
control of the Imperial authorities. ihis is the
kind of wormy journalist who writes his leading
article lying flat on his face with a large placard
on his coat-tail: “I am only a blasted colonial.
Please walk upon me.”
What a lot monarchs really care for the
people! What are the King and Queen of Italy
solicitous about ? Merely the loss of good billets.
Prince Albert, it is evident, urged Queen V ictoria
she must save money, the throne being so topply.
So she has gone on feather-bedding and bolstering
up her family, trusting the alien English as adders
fanged. We daresay the Wettin-Guelphs invest
in German stocks, while the Pope and King of
Italy rush to wolf the English.
A Queensland Labour-member remarked
lately to a Sydney pressman : “ The position of
Labour-member would be tolerable but for the
faddy strictures of the class we represent. We
dare not enter a private bar, or smoke a cigar, or
wear a white shirt, or put on a tall hat. If' we do,
we are next day inundated with letters and post-
cards, mostly anonymous, scurrilously abusing us,
and in many cases informing us that we shall be
met on our way home on the first dark night by a
man who will lay us out.”
The N.S.W. Legislative Council is losing
its Sabbath calm and its profound and fathomless
respectability. The other night John Davies
objected to Cox booming the Colo Valley Syndi-
cate’s Bill on the alleged ground that he (Cox) was
a shareholder in the speculation. At this, Cox
fixed a baleful eye on Davies and said that he,
at all events, had never had a royal com-
mission appointed to inquire into his conduct,
and John reflected in a loud, coarse voice on one of
Cox’s female relations. Then there was a feeble,
senile row in the Chamber—not the healthy roar
that goes up in the Assembly, but a weak little
noise like cockroaches walking over dead leaves ;
and a dozen members piped out “Shame!” in a
toothless treble, and then sat aghast at their own
riot and disorderliness.
“George’s grandfather gave the boy a
couple of sovereigns, and promised to reward him
further for every boy above his own size and age
whom he whopped in a similar manner. He had
a vague notion that quarrelling made boys hardy,
and that tyranny was a useful accomplishment for
them to learn. English youth have been so edu-
cated time out of mind, and we have hundreds of
thousands of apologists and admirers of injustice,
misery, and brutality, as perpetrated among
children. ’’—Vanity Fair.
Macgregor, Imperial Administrator of New
Guinea, tells mournfully of how, in the course of
his travels in that island lately, he met with a
tribe that had never heard of Queen Victoria.
Blasphemy 1 —
They made Macgregor sick.
These poor benighted folk
They knew not of Queen Vic.—
They thought she was a joke 1
They made Macgregor sick,
He couldn’t sleep in peace . • ■
They learnt about Queen Vic.
Later —through Mac.’s police.
Melb. Leader digs up again the story of
how Victoria was induced to subscribe towards the
Imperial Institute. Duncan Gillies was Premier
then, and that podgy, shiny little man, who
suffered from occasional gleams of good sense,
objected to the project. Then Somers Vine
drafted this cablegram to Wales : “ I am sorry to
inform your Royal Highness that Mr. Duncan
Gillies, Premier of Victoria, is strongly opposed
to the scheme your Royal Highness has so much at
heart.” He showed it to Gillies and said briefly :
“Aml to send this ? ” Whereupon Gillies’ vast
knees smote together with horror, and instead of
telling Vine to send it and be darned he abjectly
climbed down on the spot, and Victoria sub-
scribed to the Imperial Institute there and then.
And now the boneless Duncan goes ’Ome.
A TRUE SPORTSMAN.
BURLAR (who has been surprised red-handed) : “I say, mister, give a cove
another chance to become an honest man.”
MISTER: “All right, get up and run; I’m too much of a sportsman to
shoot anything sitting!”
The Whigs are obviously intended to be
dished again by the new scheme of Irish self-
government semi-officially propounded by the
Conservatives. This goes several better than
Gladstone, by giving England, Scotland, and
Wales self-government as well as Ireland. Five
local Councils are suggested—two in England, and
one in each of the other provinces, with large
powers. This change is badly needed, as the pre-
sent Parliament cannot effectually cope with a
tenth of the business put before it. Whether it is
really “ meant ” by the Tories time will show.
An Auckland (M.L.) solicitor has just
finished doing three months in gaol for practising
while his subscription to the local trades-union —
the Law Society—was in arrear. There was no-
thing against him except that he was stone-broke
and couldn’t pay the fees, and that he kept on fol-
lowing his profession in a feeble way all the same
in order to raise some semblance of a livelihood
for his family. The trades-union, however,
objected and hauled this non-union lawyer up
before a Judge, with the result above-mentioned.
And yet if a bricklayer’s trades-union had hauled
up a non-union bricklayer before the same Judge
and asked that he should be gaoled on the same
principles, the language of the astonished Court
would have been unpublishable.
Barrier Miner draws attention to a nice
point in the new N.S.W. Electoral Act :
Section 24 provides that “ notwithstanding anything
hereinbefore contained, no person shall be entitled to vote
unless he retains tha qualifications in respect of which
such elector’s right was issued to him.” And the return-
ing officer or deputy is, at the request of any scrutineer
or of “any two persons entitled to vote at the polling
p’aie at which he presides,” to require any person pre-
senting himself to vote to sign a statement before he may
vote answering in the affirmative this question amongst
others: —“Have you now the qualification in respect of
which the same (the elector’s right) was issued?” If he
answers falsely, he “shall on conviction incur a penalty
of £2O, or be imprisoned for ft period not exceeding one
month.
Thus, a man who shifts from one side of the street
to the other, or from one street to the other,
changes his qualification and presumedly loses his
vote. For this, it seems, people have to thank
the Legislative Council.
A Parisian chemist has an idea which will
do a lot to suppress dynamiting. He proposes
that all explosives shall be mixed with some
substance which will give them a most powerful
and loathsome odour, so that the man who carries
a bomb about with him will thereby make himself
as conspicuous as if he had an aged skunk in
his hat. Under these conditions only the
anarchist in a large way of business, who can run
his own dynamite-factory, will have any kind of.?
show.
Newcastle is the stupid name of a new
township at Korumburra coalfield, Vic. Why
don’t they re-christen the Yarra “ Thames,” and
call Smelibourne “Brummagen?”
Drunk Barry, arrested by the Wilcannia
police, was chained to a tree where myriads of
big ants were crawling. Drunk Smith, sobered
by the sight, got an axe to free Barry. A con-
stable (who admitted the ants) arrested Smith,
but the case was withdrawn. Imaginative people
might think this a fit subject for official enquiry.
Premier Dibbs, naturally enough, has been
properly “ had ” by Colonial Office Peel’s report
on the “Australian Financial Crisis of 1893,”
which turns out to have been an essay by a junior
clerk, anxious to show off his skill in diplomatic
draughting, Dibbs took it in all seriousness, and
was surprised that such a document should have
received the Imperial iinprimateur. The most
curious part of the whole affair is that it is an
almost exact fulfilment in fact of a fiction in Phil
May’s Winter Annual. It is the yarn “The
Hon. Adolphus Byng’s Revenge,” which dis-
cribes how an experimental despatch of a peppery
character, on the Constantinople question, was
substituted for the genuine document, which was
a very mild affair. The bold tone of the irrespon-
sibly-concocted paper proved a complete success,
and led to the promotion, instead of the dismissal,
as hoped, of its perpetrator.
Duncan Gillies said last week, at Ballarat,
that his translation to London will improve his
health and “ enable him to see scenes he has never
seen before.” Then the gaseous little lobbyist
cast his constitutional smirk around the festive
board and remarked that he would also learn in
London many things which might ultimately
prove of benefit to Victoria. When a political
barnacle of the Gillies class tears himself away
from his old haunts to take a trip ’Ome he assumes
the manner of an African explorer. Gillies will
investigate Hingland, and make enquiries into
Europe, and take notes of his discoveries for the
information of the great world which centres at
the top of Collins-street, Melb. He intends to do
“good work” in the great and responsible posi-
tion formerly occupied by that brilliant intellect,
Jimmy Munro. As regards the nature of his good
work Gillies is wisely vague, but his scheme of
labour may be guessed at. Gillies means to emu-
late the pair of honorary electioneering agents for
Mr, Veneering, who suddenly bethought them to
take a cab-drive in the neighbourhood of the
House of Commons, and “see how things were
looking.”
Col. Bell, American Consul at Sydney,
talks straight to Castle-hill fruit-growers :
He did not think there was a spot on God’s footstool
where they could raise finer oranges than could be raised
round Castle-hill If they would only put the
fruit in good shape and just ripe, America could consume
all the fruit Australia could raise. He could see two
faults at present among the fruitgrowers—lack of taste
and lack of cultivation. Did they not know that by
proper cultivation they could make different fruit grow
upon the same soil? Did they not know that by keeping
down the weeds they increased the flavour of their
fruits ? Did they not know that by reducing the
price so that people could use their fruits, they
would more than quadruple the profits by the addi-
tional consumption? They were making a nrstake in
raising so little. There were thousands in America living
in luxury who only cultivated 10 acres
Why did God stand them on their hind legs and
put brains in their hats? Because he designed a grand
civilisation. He remembered dining with Josh Billings
one day in an hotel, and the humourist said, “There are
two kinds of oranges, Colonel!” “Two kinds? 1 thought
there were many' kinds." “Only two,” said Billings,
“one kind is good to eat, the other kind you get in
hotels.” So it is with their oranges. One kind you could
get at Castle-hill and the other kind in Sydney. They
wanted in Sydney fresh oranges from the trees, not
mis-shapen things bruised by travelling over their
rough roads. . . . He had seen more weeds in one
corner of the best orchard in their district than he had
seen in 1000 acres in California, and the profits there were
five times as much as here. Why? Because there was no
middleman to slip in and take the profits, and because the
producer was in touch with the consumer. Why, here
the middleman received 70 per cent, of the price of the
fruit sold.

“ X.L.” : “ Strolling to South Melb., last
eve, I studied an instructive tableau. A ragged
boy had been stopped, making off to the city, with
a bagfull of sticks from one of the thousand and

Eleven thousand in South Melb. alone ! A bee-
hive and a throng collocated—a heap of children,
R picture of squalor, not a boot to half-a-dozen.
The most grievous feature was afforded by several
big girls, growing into womanhood without shoes

Chief Justice Madden, apropos of a

the other day, that the arrangement of husband

great conjugal question it may be laid down as a
rule that the “one room one bed ” system, being
generally fatal to animal magnetism, is the
deadliest of foes to “ domestic felicity.”

Dear Bulletin, —The reason why a man
never hangs up in his second wife’s house (not in a
conspicuous place, anyway) the portrait of his
first wife is just this—his second wife will not have
it. Women marrying widowers are much more
jealous of the other wife than second husbands are
jealous of the late-lamented. In tact, a man is
usually grateful to his predecessor for having
taught the lady how to appreciate number two. —
Yours, A Widower who Married a Widow.

jury, judging by the
way it arrived at its
verdict what little
verdict it did arrive at
—seems to have been
rather below even the
average intelligence of
juries. On item nine
the one on which the*
£IOO damages were
allowed—this intellec-
tual body decided un-
animously that the
Age’s statements were
libellous and untrue,
and resolved by nine
votes to three that they
were not fair comment.
Therefore, it follows
that there were three
men on the jury who
held that a statement
might be libellous and
untrue and yet be fair
comment!
Dear Bulletin, — Ee your question as to
why it is always a woman who hangs up in a
second matrimonial partner’s house the portrait of
the first, Lombroso says, in one of his earlier
works —“Woman’s sense of fitness is much less
acute than man’s, for which reason, though she
has more ornamentalness than man, she has less
true taste —more conventional comformability,
with less spontaneous decency .” Is this the
answer? Psychologists, at all events, have long
laughed at the notion that women have m jre tact
than men.—A.M.

Dear Bulletin, —The latest Argus con-
troversy is re “Why do women dislike beards ?”
Here are a few reasons :
1. Because a beard tickles a girl’s cbin.
2. Because a beard is a catchment for soup, beer, rum,
and many other things.
3. Because every girl has an idea that beards are worn
only by “common ” men—and as every girl wants her
“boy” to be a gentleman— i.e., a draper —she insists on him
shaving either and la Hopetoun, or on (he plans and speci-
fications used in building that awful lawyer-soldier
person “Capt.” Taylor, of Hawthorn.
4. Because a beard can hide a multitude of sins—such
as a Deeming mouth or a viscount chin : and a girl wants
to minimise her risks.
These are all I can think of just now. —The
Reckless.

do.

Mr. G. E. Ardill, the manager of several
Sydney charitable institutions, proposes to obtain
the erasure from local police-court records of the
conviction and fine standing against him for
cruelty to a horse. The point of the matter is
that Mr. Ardill was the owner of a sore-backed
horse, but knew nothing of the animal being
worked, a carter having put him in harness with-
out the owner’s leave. The incident rankles, and,
besides, serves enemies for purposes of allusion.

That nightmare of civilisation, the woman
who can’t cook, has devised anew and horrible
way of punishing the man who won’t eat what
she cooks. A resident of Warrnambool (Vic.) the
other day turned up his nose at the breakfast.
His wife shut her lips tight, but said nothing.
Then lie came home and sniffed contemptuously
at the dinner. It was too much. She grabbed
the baby and ran for the dam. The baby was
dropped on the bank, but the woman jumped into
the water and was all but drowned. The general
opinion at Warrnambool now is that “some men
would aggravate a saint.” Nobody dares to say
“Pity she wasn’t quite drowned.” Who will
found a league of henpecked husbands?

and so would our asiociation if it were not for the hope
that there were plenty of fools in Australia lo pay money

into three parties—first, the Laneitos, or immediate
followers of Mr. Lane; second, thosj who will stick to the
association as long as there h tucker; third, those who
are going to apply to the Paraguayan Government for
land. . . . Forty-five of us “ rebels ” signed a requisi-

made no statement, but when questioned gave vague,

impression that a*big land-swindle was on the board.

A story of the Austral Salon. The clever
wife of a Melb. pressman read a paper there on
Walt Whitman, but omitted to touch on his
biography. Then the chairwoman called on a
well-known University man who was present to
give an impromptu account of the poet’s life. He
knew nothing about Walt’s life, but, being a bit
of a practical joker, extemporised a few yards of
fictional biography on the spot. On the motion
of the chairwoman he received a unanirnons vote
of thanks. He met the essayist after trie meeting,
and she suggested that liehad been playing itrather
low down on a trustful audience. “My dear
madam,” was the reply, “ what do those people
know of literature? Are they not just as happy
as if I had given them three volumes of solid
truth?” And the lady, though a member of the
committee, agreed that they were. Moral—well,

One of the episodes of the late M.L.
elections was a pathetic meeting between a father
and his long-lost cheeild. The old man was
acting as returning-officer in a Northern dis-
trict, and among the lady voters a rather
nice-looking half-caste girl appeared and bash-
fully put her oily and high-flavoured head into
the polling-booth. Then she mustered up courage
and followed it. The returning-officer asked her
name in a business-like voice, and when she
supplied it he looked at her with a puzzled expres-
sion for a while, and then said briefly : “Why,
bless my soul, you're my daughter !” The pathetic
meeting ended there. The Maori girl simply
voted and went away, and the parties didn’t
embrace each other and weep, neither did the
father take his daughter home with him, and wash
the grease off her head, and bequeath her all his
fortune. He didn’t even ask how her mother was
getting along.
Maoriland is the most Democratic country

he gets them substantial grants of money. His
life is made up of violent transitions, from mole-
skin pants and dirty shirt-when he is “old
Smith to a frock-coat-top-hat-flower-in-button-
hole existence, when he is “Mr. Smith” and
welcomes all notables. Next day he’ll be whack-
ing around the street with a barrow, or a long-
handled shovel, and be “old Smith” again with
the “top-hat,” &c., laid up in lavender for the
next ceremonial.

Dear Bulletin, —“ Yerbum,” in a recent
issue, is certainly not verbum sap. The “idiom of
the language” neither “requires ”nor “sanctions”
the phrase, “I quite forgot all about it.” His
criticism is beside the mark. Tautology is de-
fensible when it adds strength or perspicuity;
here it adds neither. And “ Verbum ” seems un-
aware that in “How do you do?” one “do”
comes from A. S. doan, to act, be ; the other from
A.S. dugan, to be good for, thrive. The words
have the same form, but different meaning and
derivation. The salutation really equals “ How
are you thriving ? ” We do not “ talk nonsense ”
when we use it. —Yours, A.
Gilbert Parker, telling a yarn for Phil
May’s Annual, seems to claim credit for dis-
covering the most ancient of everyday facts: —“ I
made up my mind then (and I haven’t altered it)
that the best of women may—and do —cultivate
the actor’s art to a degree not fully recognised by
themselves.” The writer, who exhibits old pebbles
of prattle with all the pomp and circumstance due
to new pearls of wisdom, is as ridiculous as the
amateur gardener who cultivates a common weed
in a flower pot believing it to be something choice.
Gilbert Parker’s style, in its pompous mood, re-
minds one of Haddon Chambers’ “The Idler.”
What does the Yankee say to the baronet in that
stagey play ! “Asa student of human nature you
have doubtless observed that when a man hates a
man, sooner or later, he is sure to meet him.”
Which is glorified nonsense.
Editor Bulletin. Sir, —Pardon me, an
admirer of Tommy Byrnes and a reader of The
Bulletin, for thinking the latter is often unjust
to tlie former. It has accused him of being a
traitor, though we here in Brisbane see nothing
in his political conduct inconsistent with the
views he expressed before he entered public life.
He would be the last to dissemble his opinions.
one would think, from worldly motives, judging
by his magnificently indiscreet and undiplomatic
display of Catholicism -going so far as to de-
liver addresses on Lacordaite to a non-Cathohc
audience —in a colony saturated with Orangeism ,
a display, I venture to say, which no other K.U.
public man is bold enough to attemptin t le w 10 e
British Empire outside of Ireland. How little he
values office was amply shown some months
since, when he was ready to resign ra >er
than see an injustice done to a Civil servant
in his own department, who was socially a
“ nobody,” and whom backdoor secret society
influence was seeking to “cruel” in favour o a
“brother” who was a “ sassiety-man. it is sam
that “ success has turned his head, &c. ; out
his latter-day deportment is that of a man
“ neither ashamed of his origin nor vain
of his elevation,” and it is refreshing to com
trast his acoessibleness and absence of siae
with the ferocious and awe-inspiring hauteur
which broke out like a rash on some of his prede-
cessors as soon as they were gazetted to the same
high office. But, not content with blackening him
politically, The Bulletin tries to belittle him
professionally, and speaks of certain plodders
who are passing him at the Bar —an event quite
as probable as that the old hulk, Success, now
in the river here, should beat a P. and O. steamer
in an ocean race. The fact is that Byrnes
is about the best “all-round ” man that has ever
practised at the Queensland Bar, inasmuch as he
is as sound a lawyer as Real, as profound a scholar
as Griffith, and as accomplished an advocate as
Virgil Power. Add to this that Dalrymple is the
only man in the present Parliament that can hold
his own with him in debate, and that he is the
platform - speaker par excellence of his native
colony—compared with him footlight smarties
of the much-vaunted Kingsbury breed (imported)
are but as rush-lights to the sun —and you must
admit he has good reason for being a trifle con-
ceited, while at the same time he has less conceit
than any other man who has “ risen,” with whom
I am acquainted. — Yours, Libra, Brisbane, 18th
January, 1894.
[Queensland Democrats may make what they please out
of this. The Bulletin keeps its own opinion of Mr.
Byrnes. If “Libra” signed his real name the public
would have a better idea as to how the milk got into the
cocoa-nut. —Ed. B.]

“Miss Spence, of Australia,” says a New
York paper, “ is here to show women how to cast
a ballot which will shame the ingenuity of men.
In the Woman’s Suffrage Association assembled
in Brooklyn, the fair Australian was introduced
as ‘Mrs. Spence.’ She could not stand that
imputation. ‘I wish it understood,’ said she,
‘that lam an old maid. When I desire to go to
a meeting of women, therefore, no man has the
prerogative of saying, ‘My dear, are you sure
that my bottles are all filled?’ There was laughter.
The lady, no doubt, meant ‘babies,’ not bottles.
Nature generally seems to have denied to the
strong-minded the blessing of babies.”
It is now for the first time broadly hinted
that the Princess of Wales has “broken down,”
and will not be equal to any further appearances

rumour tell truly —she will be as much retired as
her insane sister. The world loses nothing.
Alexandra of Wales has been kept going, so to
speak, by English illustrated papers for many
years. She is an almost stone-deaf, lame lady
who looks, or did until recently, strangely young for
her age. Incapable of hard thinking, she went

people of Great Britain were commonly said to
love her. But why they should love this figure-
head of royalty in a Paris bonnet was an inscrut-
able mystery.
The just-deceased N.S.W. pastoral mil-
lionaire “ Locky ” Mcßean, not long since,
built a pub at Moulamein, and when it was
opened the workmen called on “ Locky ” to shout
for all hands. This he refused to do, but told
them he would give them ‘'something good for the
road,” to be used on their journey back to Denili-
quin—a 70 mile drive. When the men were ready
to start, “ Locky ” came forward with two bottles
wrapped in paper, which he handed to the driver
of the buggy, telling him that he hoped the men
would share the contents with one another. The
bottles contained cold tea. About ten years ago
“Locky” went in for Chinese dress, and up to
the time of his death always wore a Chow’s blouse
with the sleeves turned up in real Chinaman
fashion. “ Locky ” always travelled second-class
on the railways, and in days gone by, when hotel
charges were pretty high in Deniliquiu, it was his
custom, when he honoured that town with a visit,
to camp under the big bridge.

MRS. CALAP GOES TO SEE MRS. MILLS.
And it was not for an hour's chat over a cup of
tea that she went to see her, but on a much more
serious matter. For Mrs. Mills had been quoted
in the newspapers as having said something which
might be of importance to Mrs Calap, and also to
others. Now the newspapers print so many things
that nobody can make head or tail of, that Mrs.
Calap thought the only sure way was to go and see
Mrs. Mills and ask her if it was true what was
said. What Mrs. Mills told her is contained in
the annexed statement made about a year after-
wards :
“I, Jane Calap, of 3, Vincent Street, York
Road, Leeds, do solemnly and sincerely declare
as follows :
“In the early part of November, 1887, I fell
into a low, weak state. I was tired, languid, and
weary, and felt as if something had come oyer me.
All my bones ached and I had so much pain that
I did not know where to put myself. I was con-
stantly vomiting, sometimes a green, bitter fluid
came away, at other times frothy water. I had a
dull, heavy pain at the right side, and the whites of
my eyes were a yellow colour, and my skin was
sallow as if I had the jaundice. I had an awful
taste in the mouth, my tongue and teeth being
covered with slime so thick that I had to scrape it
away. My appetite fell away, and after eating
the simplest and lightest food I had so much pain
that it nearly killed me. I had always great pain
and weight at my chest and through to my back,
also a gnawing, sinking sensation at the pit of my
stomach. I was greatly troubled with wind which
rolled all over me, and gave me so much pain it
was like spasms, for I could not straighten myself.
I gradually got weaker and weaker, and felt so
weak and exhausted that I could scarcely drag
myself along. As time went on I wasted away
until I got as thin as a match, and could barely
walk across the floor. I felt so downhearted that
I used tc say I shall never get better any more in
this world. I took all kinds of medicines, but
finding myself getting worse I got a recommend-
ation to the Leeds Infirmary, where I was at-
tended to by several doctors, who gave me medi-
cines, which I took month after month, but I got
no better. The doctors sounded my chest and
lungs, and seemed puzzled with my sufferings, for
they frequently changed my medicine. Getting
no better 1 next went to the Dispensary in North
Street, and persevered taking their medicines, but
it was all to no purpose. I now gave up taking
physic, for I had lost all faith in it, and my
sufferings continued until January, 1891, when I
heard a neighbour of mine, Mrs. Ann Mills, 40,
Bread Street, having been cured (after the doctors
had given her up) by a medicine called Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup. I went with my
daughter to see Mrs. Mills, who told me that
Seigel’s Syrup had saved her life, and would do me
good. I got a bottle of the medicine, and after
taking a few doses I felt relief. I continued with
the Syrup, and after taking three bottles all the
pain left me, my food agreed with me and I grad-
ually gained strength. I can now take any kind
of food and never feel any distress and am as
strong as ever I was. After my recovery a lady
customer of mine said to me “ Mrs. Calap, what-
ever have you been taking, for- you do look so
well, ” I told her, as I tell everyone, that Seigel’s
Syrup has made me a new woman, and but for it
I should not be alive, I wish others to know of
the benefit I have derived from the medicine, and
I give full permission to the proprietors to use
this statement as they may think fit, and I make
this solemn declaration conscientiously believing
the same to be true. By virtue of the provisions
of the Statutory Declaration Act, 1835 (Will. IV.
e. 62.”
“ Declared before me at Leeds this")

Jane Calap
The public may remember the account of Mrs
Mills’ illness and recovery, published some time
ago. We are glad that Mrs. Calap heard of it and
went straight to that lady herself for the infor-
mation she wanted. The visit resulted just as
might have been expected. Both our good friends
had suffered from the same disease, indigestion
and dyspepsia, and the remedy which cured in the
first case was equally successful in that of her
neighbour. No wonder Mrs. Calap had lost
all faith in physic, and if Mother Seigel’s Syrup
were “physic,” we should not look for people to
have faith in it either. But it is a remedy, not
“ physic.” It doesn’t upset and disgust, it soothes
and heals. Men fall ill, to be sure, but women bear
most of the pain in this sad world, and when once
acquainted they and “ Mother Seigel” are “ever
the best of friends,” like Joe and Pip in Dickens’
story.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the lengUj_and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet ofpaper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
were you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bootmaking is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the
LOWEST POSSIBLE PRICES FOR CASH,
Post Free to any Post-town in Australia. CATALOGUES
POST FREE.
No matter how far hack in the interior you may reside,
we post the boots DIRECT TO YOUR DOOR. ELLIS'S
system has already proved a sovereign balm to thousands
of country residents who, whilst performing their daily
avocations, had previously to endure the excruciating
tortures of narrow-fitting and shapeless foot gear, the
insoles of which fairly bristle with tacks and other un-
comfortable impedimenta. All boots made on specially-
constructed lasts, giving the foot an ample tread,
and consequently comfort. You can WEAR ELLIS’S
BOOTS STRAIGHT AWAY—they are a “ going con-
cern” from the start. The materials are well tanned, and
will not “draw” or blister the feet, as most new boots
do. Send for catalogue, post free. The following

“The majority of English people never
bathe. They wash mostly. They keep their hands
and faces as clean as circumstances will allow.
But their bodies? F. Boyle in New Review.
It is not generally known that A. G.
Taylor once tackled a novel. Three chapters
appeared in the Bathurst Sentinel. In the first
chapter three bushrangers were hemmed in by the
police and were about to be shot. In the second
a man was introduced at the bottom of a deep
shaft alone with his agony, and some bread and
water were lowered down by an unknown hand.
The third chapter contained a criminal who
was to be executed the following morning. At
this stage A. G. joined the artillery, and shortly
afterwards was elected for Mudgee, and so none
of the characters have ever since been extricated
from their unfortunate predicaments.
Old “Looky” M’Bean, the N.S.W. mam-
moth squatter, who died the other day, was very
close-fisted. Travellers staying overnight at
Locky’s were always charged grazing fees for their
horses, unless they stabled them, when, strange to
say, the feed was gratis. If a visitor asked for a
towel in the morning, “Have ye no’ a handker-
chief whateffer ?” Locky would ask in amazement.
Locky was related in various degrees of cousinship
to the late James Macpherson Grant, Mrs. David
Blair, E. C. Grant of “Chah Sing,’’ the Robert-
sons of Colao, and other Highland families of
Victoria. His next-of-kin are his sister, Mrs.
Grant, her son, and two nephews M'Bean.

Words are curious things. If they are the
same, they are different; and if they are different
they are still the same. When Solomon said, of
making many boots there is no end, he was all
right; but if he had said, in making many (boots
there is no last, he would have been all wrong.
This may be proved by reference to the advt. of
T. E. Ellis, Hunter-street, Newcastle, in another
part of this issue. Mr. Ellis has made boots for
biov, Jersey himself, and many, many minor
notorieties. His lasts are all stuck in by ex-
perienced shoemakers —whence the proverb, let
the shoemaker stick in his last. Try T. E. Ellis.*

THE
GENILEMEN who find their Razors unsatisfactory should not fail to give our celebrated Plum
Razor a trial. This brand of razor is something superior to any others offered to the public.
It is specially-tempered, perfectly hollow ground, rings like a bell and never requires grinding. We
can highly recommend this brand to the general public. Being practical tradesmen ourselves, we
know the exact kind of edge that is required to ensure an easy shave, and, having had them in use for
a number of years, can testify to its merits. We guarantee each Razor for Two Years.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The fifty-second intercolonial cricket-match be-
tween Victoria and N.S.W. resulted in a win for N.S.W.
by 19 runs. Scores:—N.S.W, first innings, 127 ; second
innings, 151. Callaway, with 38 and 50; Moses, 24 and
11; Gregory, 20 (not out) and 10 ; led the scoring. Vic-
toria, first innings, 88; second innings, 171. Trumble,
26; Graham, 45; Macleod, 23 ; were the principal run-
getters. Victoria won the last three matches.

“ Gate ” was sticking out a yard all through.
On the last day it had been arranged to start at noon.
The starting-hour was postponed, however, on account of
the alleged state of the wicket, but the few people on the
ground winked the other eye and said “gate.”
« • *
Gate may be all very well when it does not affect
the issue of the match. On this occasion at least one man
was included in the team solely with an eye on gate ; and
there is no gauging the effect a postponement fora short
period on such a wicket might have on the result of the
game.
** * •
“ Gala,” the Sydney Consultation man, has
(subject to appeal) been ordered to gaol for three months
as one of the earliest results of Minister Slattery’s recent
awakening. “ Gala’s " sweeps were well-known for their
squareness, but the honest sweepist always comes to grief
first, somehow.
« « •
The betting moths will flutter round the “ Bill”
Long stable, and then they complain when burnt. How-
ever, let one of them place himself in Mr. Bill Long's
place, and he would argue thus: “I am certainly a
wealthy man, but I am running an immense stud, a
private racecourse, Hobartville stud farm, etc., etc.; and
it is almost out of remembrance since I won a race worth
calling a race. 1 have Salutation in the Challenge Stakes,
and think I have a first-rate show, but the public have
forestalled me, and to back the horse I must now accept
stol, a ridiculous price in such a field. I have Gloria in
the same race, and I think I have a show ; anyhow, I
would rather back her at 12 or 14 to 1 than the other filly
at fours or fives, so I’ll scratch Salutation now and run
for the Handicap.” It may be some satisfaction for
the “moths ” to know that Mr. Long probably lost more
on Salutation in the Anniversary Handicap, than he won
on Gloria in the Challenge Stakes.
* * *
The Corinthian Plate at Rand wick on Friday,
with its gentlemen jocks, was very funny. “ Now,” said
Tom Brown, as final instructions to Mr. Stephen, who
rode Mr. Long’s Aurelius, “the horse is slow in getting
away; don’t bustle him for the first furlong, but let him
get his legs before you take a feeler at them.” Aurelius,
to his people’s surprise and delight, jumped off with the
lead, but Mr. Stephen “ rode to orders,” and pulled his
mount back nearly last in the first furlong, and in the
last furlong he was pretty well in the same position. One
“gent.” fell off after passing the post, and another got
his whip so entangled in his horse’s mane that it had to
be cut out.
# * *
People are asking what N.S.W. Cricket Asso-
ciation intends to do with its rapidly-accumulating surplus
cash. If the writer remembers aright, the deed stipulated
that all proceeds must be expended on the ground. If
the Association’s wealth is becoming a trouble, would it not
be a fair thing to erect some sort of covering for the
habitues of the flat, whose accumulated shillings, as a
matter of fact, keep the thing going ? Expenditure on
the palatial buildings for the members—and dead-heads—
nr ght surely be given a rest for a time.
« * «
“Billy” Murdoch may be good “gate,” but he
ii becoming anything out good cricket. In his first
innings he stayed 30 minutes for two runs, and in his
lecond, after getting a “twoer," it took him minutes to
get his wind. Murdoch is not a representative N.S. Welsh-
man, nor is he as good a cricketer as a wagon-load of men
in the province. If the Association were running a mere
money-making concern, it would be rierht enough, but as
the people’s trustees, they have a right, while they can
afford it, to put the best available eleven into the field,
even if they knew such an eleven would not draw a fiver
at the gate.
• • •
No greater contrast can be imagined than that
between Corbett and Mitchell. Corbett, the beau-ideal
of a heavy-weight modern glove-fighter, flushed with vic-
tory and in the hey-day of youth, as against Mitchell, of
the old-time “ butty ” build, and worn out with years of
mad dissipation. As might have been expected, Corbett,
with the arrogance born of youth, confidence, and
strength, fairly mowed down his effete opponent, and
knocked him to a standstill in three rounds.
# # *
England and America are now competing as to
the venue of a contest between Corbett and Jackson. If
Jackson can get into form, it should prove the fight of the
century. When last they met Jackson had a sprained
ankle, and they fought some 60 rounds before a draw was
declared. Since then Corbett has, no doubt, gained in
strength and ring experience, and has led a steady life;
but how Jackson’s living has been for the past few years
no one here quite knows. On paper Corbett’s chance
looks quite as good as Jackson’s.
• • *
England, like America, has no room for the
losing boxer. Instead of hero-worship, Slavin now meets
cold neglect, and is doing very little business in his
small pub. This alone should show that Mitchell did
his level best against Corbett.
# • •
It was not only Corbett that beat Mitchell. The
fur-lined coat, the big diamond pin and strict attention to
his benefactor (Abington), knocked Charles out. But
how a man can for years maintain a reputation by mere
“blow” has never been so brightly exemplified as in
Mitchell’s case.
* * «
George Adams, the sweep-promoter, says that
the N.S.W. Government will lose between £30,000 and
£40,000 a year revenue by the removal of his sweep busi-
ness from the province.

N.S.W. team say M.L. swimmers are splendid
fellows, with hearts as big as a bullock’s, but—they can’t
swim.

The s(sth annual regatta was held on the Der-
went, at Hobart, on Jan. 26-the "Anniversary Day” of
Tasmania. Many of the competitors in the first regatta,
held nearly 60 years ago, are still living, and were present
at the latest gathering.

Chris, Neilson won the sculling handicap at
Sydney Anniversary Regatta—a clear proof that there is
no encouragement for young scullers nowadays.
Premier Kingston on bookmakers : —“lnstead of
being a blessing to sport they are a curse. See the num-
ber of dishonest tricks that the bookmakers all over Aus-
tralia have been guilty of. Why, it is notorious that the
greater part of the swindling that has been done has
emanated from the bookmakers. They are injurious to
the community in every way, and should be suppressed.
I did not frame the law that made it illegal for these
people to carry on their calling, but I most certainly shall
do nothing to repeal it. I think that I am doing the
best possible thing for the sport by suppressing those
people who have proved after years of trial that their
presence is detrimental to genuine racing and common
honesty.”

Happy typographical error from a N.Q.
in memoriam:—
Although he’s gone, we know ’tis best,
For Gold called him when he thought best.
About 100 starving wretches live in Paris
by hunting for pence in the streets. So inexorable
is the law of averages that a certain number of
coppers are dropped every day, and it is a recog-
nised business to find them again in the gutters or
between the paving-stones.
Oolemane & Sons’ Eucalypte Ex. is the strongest
Ignatius Donnelly, in “ The Golden
Bottle,” says that “every woman instinctively
desires to be a lady.” If he means that every
woman, being intrinsically worth eighteenpence,
instinctively poses as half-a-crown, and cold-
shoulders every other unfortunate female wretch
who cannot get higher than one-and-ninepence,
we believe that Ignatius Donnelly is perfectly
correct.
A number of free Kanakas were recently
observed to collect in a little shop in a Queensland
sugar-town. They adjourned to a back room
furnished with table and forms and one of their
number rose and moved that—“ Tommy Tanna
he go long a chair.” Tommy Tanna was, accord-
ingly, duly elected chairman and the meeting pro-
ceeded to business. Some planter had ill-treated
one of their party who made his statement and
called witnesses. It was then moved and carried
unanimously that “No fellow boy go work long
Missa K ” and the meeting was dissolved by the
chairman who announced with much gravity
“ This meeting and Missa K altogether
finish.”
Oolemane & Sons’ Special Eucal. Oil is A one.
In a case of appeal against municipal valua-
tion (for rating purposes) at South Melbourne,
a sworn valuator deposed that his judgment had
been entirely “under the seductive influence of his
colleague.” Asked whether he had been a dummy
in the matter, this candid professional gent re-
plied— “ I was wilfully misled. If ever you got
under the influence of a man like my colleague
you would have to be very smart to escape.”
There’s something in this unusual confession.
Every man in the world can do as he will with one
or more other men. Brown, subjugated by Jones,
may be seen ruling Robinson, who turns Jones
round his little finger.

Professor Tlmliiiius. —My Dear Sir,—l feel I should be want-
ing iu duty, dhl I neglect the opportunity of sending you my
testimony as to the wondrous efficacy of your rheumatic
specific. For the past ten years I have been a complete
martyr to rheumatism in all its forms. I have tried doctors
. . . . with a view of effecting a cure for this most trying
disease I am well known, and scores can testify
ihat at best I could only crawl about with difficulty. . . .
After leaving Little Bay Hospital at the close of last year X
was persuaded to try a bottle of your “ Thulinius,” and in a
week or so afterwards I could get about fairly well. Upon
a rain suflfeiing a relapse last February, I took another bottle,
with an equally successful result; but at last I determined to
go through a course of treatment, and I have just completed
my fourth bottle, with the gratifying knowledge that I am
quite free from pain, can w'alk any reasonable distance with-
out fatigue, have an excellent appetite, and feel myself again
competent to re-enter nay profession, added to which ray oft-
repeated attacks of pleurisy have become a thing of the past.
I have not dieted myself in any way, so all the credit is due to
your wonderful remedy, under Providence, that my blood is
becoming purer daily, and its effect upon my liver and kid-
neys most pronounced. ... I shall only be too glad
personally to convince fellow-sufferers of the benefits to be
derived from a course of your treatment, as exemplified in
mv own case, after ten years’ martyrdom.—l remain, yours
faithfully, W. XI. NEWTON NEWMAN (Teacher of Elocution
and twenty-five years Actor and Manager)

A Coming Wool Firm.
In these times of commercial depression and
financial disquietude, it is refreshing to observe a
satisfactory improvement in the great wool-
broking industry of the province. The total
quantity of wool sold in our local market from
the commencement of the present season to the
end of last week amounts to 352,841 bales, as
against 300,059 disposed of during a similar period
in the years 1892-3, showing an increase of 52,782
bales. These figures present a hopeful aspect for
the future, and fully justify the erection of addi-
tional storage to the already formidable array of
warehouses constructed for that purpose in our
city. The total number of bales which have reached
Sydney from the Ist July, 1893, either for sale
there or shipment to London, amounts to
599,780 or 73,878 more than during a corresponding
period last season. Each succeeding year brings
additional competition to these shores from both
European and American markets, and hence wool-
growers are beginning to recognise the fact that it
is more satisfactory to realise in the colonial
markets than incur the expense and run the risk
attending shipment to foreign auction marts. It
is only too evident that our long-headed wool-
brokers have long foreseen this happy change,
otherwise, how account for the astonishing
rapidity in the erection of so many new and
commodious stores during the past few years,
which present such a striking appearance
on both sides of the harbour ? And, as this
astonishing progress is characterised by fresh in-
centives to exertion, it is only natural to expect,
from time to time, an infusion of new blood in
the ranks of those to whose care these huge con-
signments are entrusted. In recent issues of The
Bulletin attention has been directed to the
young firm of M‘Burney, Wallis & Co., Circular
Quay and Margaret-street, Sydney, who consti-
tute the latest addition to the wool-brokers of the
province. They entered on their bold undertaking
some six months ago, and whatever doubt (if any)
may have existed as to their prospects has, by
this time, been forcibly dispelled by the success, un-
paralleled in the historyof Australian wool-broking,
which has attended their opening season. About
a fortnight ago this firm, finding their energies
severely taxed owing to their rapidly increasing
business, deemed it advisable to take into part-
nership two young gentlemen, Mr. Samuel J.
Head and Mr. Robert C. Franks, both of whom
have for some years been associated with Messrs.
Winchcombe, Carson and Co. in the capacity of
travelling representatives. Mr. Head, who is a
son of Mr. J. H. Head, the popular owner of
Waterloo station, Walcha, is well-known in the
district of New England, where he was
born. He is also favourably known amongst
the residents of the Mouaro and Liverpool
Plains. He has given ample proof that he
possesses the tact, energy, and address which
are essential qualities in a thorough business-
representative. He has already commenced a
canvass of his favourite route, and indications are
readily forthcoming which point to a continuation
of that friendly feeling which has for years existed
between former clients and himself.
Mr. Franks has from his youth been an in-
dustrious follower of pastoral pursuits, and in his
new sphere this early apprenticeship must be pro-
ductive of happy results. Later on in life he
accepted and occupied, for a considerable time,
the responsible position of Inspector of Condi-
tional Purchases. About two years ago he became
identified with the firm of Winchcombe, Carson
and Co. as their representative, principally
in the Western district, where he has
succeeded in securing the patronage of a large
circle of friends. His intimate knowledge of that
portion of the country, together with a practical
experience in station products, must render in-
valuable assistance in his new field of operations.
While the present season will shortly close, and
foreign buyers will soon commence to wing their
way to a colder hemisphere, preparations for a
Canvass of the ensuing clip have already com-
menced, and both Messrs. Head and Franks are
now in their respective districts full of encourage-
ment and hope in their new venture.
The many friends of M‘Burney, Wallis and Co.
will hail with satisfaction the additional strength
to the firm which must necessarily follow the in-
clusion of these gentlemen as partners. From the
day when the venerable Parkes performed the
inaugurating ceremony which announced the
advent of the new firm into the woolbroking
arena, steady progress has rewarded their efforts,
and the writer, in common with thousands of
others, predicts that in the course of a few years
Messrs. M‘Burney, Wallis and Co. will occupy a
prominent position in the already formidable list
of successful brokers, and this anticipation war-
rants the announcement that they are a coming
wool firm.
W. E. Smith, of Bridge-street, Sydney,
has just turned out a chromo-lithograph in six
colours, which can compare favourably with any
advertising work yet imported into Australia.
The work in question was done for Tillock and
Co. to advertise a favourite brand of preserves,
and is the best local sample of such art which
The Bulletin has yet seen.
The most recent distribution of real estate
by ballot is that known as the Victorian property
distribution syndicate, of which Mr. P. W.
Millane is the beginning and the middle, the end
being the beautiful “ Valley ” Farm, Belinda
Vale, or one of the 162 other prizes. The
promoter, Mr. Millane, is the owner of all
the properties which are to be distributed as
prizes. The scheme is arranged in a way that makes
the whole working perfectly legal—every sub-
scriber of £1 secures a share in the syndicate,
which purchases all the properties off Mr. Millane,
and then ballots to decide who of the members
shall have prizes or blanks as the case may be.
The Valley Farm dairy is a perfect institution,
and came off best in the Govt, trial against 114
entries, and the other prizes are proportionately
valuable.
James Paget on cancer: “More persons
than heretofore reach an adult age, and as cancer
is a disease of degeneracy, the frequency of which
increases as years increase, there is necessarily a
numerical augmentation of those living who
become liable to its attack.” Against this it is,
however, contended that what is known as the
pre-cancerous state is now much easier of diagnosis
and that with the general recognition of the pre-
monitory signs its eradication is usually possible
before matters have progressed too far.
Clement Wragge, the weather-seer, gets
many of his most useful advices and warnings
from Captain Simpson, of the s.s. Thermopylae.
Simpson is a meteorological enthusiast, who never
forgets to send a wire to his friend Wragge from
every port he touches on his voyage. There are
others who send reliable news to the Bananaland
tipster, and take a pride in the success of his
prophecies. Wragge has several honorary touts
working for him.
“Those newspapers which, though called
‘evening,’ in reality cast a gloom over luncheon.”

He Died Upon the Street.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
, J° UN Jenkins, aged 29, was found dead in a street off
Whitechapel. Dr. Han WELL testified cause of death to be
insufficient nourishment. Some acquaintances who iden-
tified the body gave evidence that deceased was an honest,
industrious workman too proud to seek relief, &c.—
Lloyd's Weekly.
For the sinful gutter maiden there was haven,
there was aid.
For the gaol-bird sorrow-laden there was Prison-
Gate Brigade;
For the villains of the city there was shelter, there
was bed,
For the murd’rer there was pity—lor the burglar
there was bread.
But he'd never learnt garotting, and he’d never
tried to steal,
And by dark, burglarious plotting he had never
earned a meal;
And he’d never stunned or strangled folks or
jumped upon his wife,
And he’d never mauled or mangled any mortal in
his life.
Rogues’ resorts would not receive him—him the
man of honest name,
And should Workhouse folks relieve him, he was
branded with a shame ;
He was neither worm nor spoiler—he was one
beyond the pale,
He was but a broken toiler who had never been in
gaol.
Had he been a Mongol tainted by the blight of
leper land,
Or a savage scarred and painted—he had found a
helping hand ;
Had he been a knave or idiot he had gained a sure
retreat—
He was only poor and honest—so he died upon the
street .
P. LUFTIG.
Whitely, of London.
William Whitely, the colossal London univer-
sal provider, was born in Yorkshire, and was,
when 16, apprenticed to a draper. He found his
way to London in ’sl (Exhibition year), and in
’63, having scraped together a few hundred
pounds, began to look round for a good invest-
ment. During his wanderings in search of a suit-
able location, Wliitely happened to pass one day
through Westbourne Grove, when his eye fell on
a placard in a shop-window announcing that the
place was to let.
“I stood and had a good look,” he says; “I
rather liked the general appearance of the place.
It was three o’clock when I first took stock of the
premises. I stood opposite for two hours, that
is, until five o’clock, and I felt quite sure that if
I had that shop and took care to have the window
nicely dressed with pretty flowers, laces, ribbons,
gloves, etc,, and ticketed at prices commanding
a sale, I had seen enough passengers and traffic go
by in the two hours to insure sufficient business
to pay expenses. So I walked up one side of
the Grove and down the other, and was wonder-
fully surprised to see how far behind the age
Westbourne shops were. 1 looked round the
neighbourhood and found it a good and greatly-
increasing quarter, and the result of a few in-
quiries was to put me in possession of the fact that
the inhabitants were badly catered for. I then
inquired about the shop from a man who had the
letting of it. I found there had been two tenants
in it since it had been built, and that both had
failed. However, I felt that that Was their own
fault, and not of the shop or its situation. So I
made up my mind to take it. I spent my little
i*} Ol iooo° n • B^°lJ an( i started business on March
11, 1808, with two young ladies and an errand-boy
to assist me. ’
• the end of the first 12 months he was employ-
ing 16 salesmen and women, and two light porters
and three years later—when little over 30 years of
age—was able to rent the adjoining shop, Which he
further extended by building over the garden at
the rear of the house.
His most rapid rise, however, dates from the
year 73. The retail trade of the United King-
dom was suffering from general and prolonged
depression, due partly to the coming into exist-
ence of large stores conducted on the co-operative
plan, with which competition became next to im-
possible. 1 hanks to the double advantage of
cheapness and an ability to supply every ordinary
want, from clothing down to comestibles, these
stores for a while threatened to wipe out their
smaller rivals throughout the metropolis. When
Whitely discovered that he had this depression to
encounter on one side, and the keen competition
of powerful organisation on the other, he decided
to adopt the very methods that were bringing
success to his rivals. He realised that the success
of the co-operatives ” was due not to the small
membership-fee exacted from every customer, but
to , t , he i r enonil °us volume of business, which
enabled them to secure proportionate discounts at
their base of supplies. With this end in view, he
first made sure of competent help. Then he set
to work with unflinching perseverance and un-
tiring energy to extend his already well-estab-
lished business until it should surpass all its rivals.
His dream has been realised. Shop after shop
has been added to the establishment, so that, at
the time of writing, there are 14 in Westbourne
Grove and seven in Queen’s Road, the former
being brick buildings, the latter stone. A few
hundred yards away we find extensive stables,
accommodating 400 horses, and, if we take the
tram to Croydon, another large stable. Then,
again, there is the Manor Farm, at Finchley,
which supplies not only large quantities of fodder!
vegetables, fruits, and flowers, but meat and dairy
produce for the provision department. From this
farm alone 60 two-horse waggons come to London
daily. One could place two “Bon Marches” on
the area occupied by Whitely’s stores.
Whitely’s great ambition is to deserve the
appellation of “ Universal Provider.” He aims
at supplying every want of the citizen, from the
moment he sees the light of day (which includes
IJ u 6(^a Ca attendance at his birth) to the moment he
shuffles off this mortal coil—and this last phase
includes the coffin, the hearse, the parson, and
the plot in the cemetery. Of course, Whitely acts
as a meie intermediary in many eases ; but he will
secure you medical attendance, all the same, at
pretty short notice; he will build you a yacht,
engage actors for you, find tutors for your child ren,
and so forth and so on. He will do all this for
you at a discount for ready money, and having
beaten down the doctor and the undertaker, the
ship-builder, the actor, and the tutor, he will
pocket a handsome profit. But his enterprise
does not end here. He deals in the fowls of the
t'Xy the beasts of the field, and the denizens of the
deep—alive for the aviary, menagerie, and
aquarium, dead for the table of the epicure. Do
you require a railway-ticket, or wish to arrange
for a journey to any portion of the habitable
globe? Whitely is your man, for through some
“scalping” process he is able to accommodate
you cheaper even than the renowned Cook. He
will book you at any London theatre, sell or buy
your stocks and shares, attend to your mortgages
and real-estate transactions, bank your money at
5 per cent, interest, collect your rents, and manage
your property.
And while he is thus occupied, he finds time to
do the largest dry-goods, clothing, and general-
utility-article business in the world. Every shop
of the two dozen or so in Westbourne Grove and
Queen’s Road represents a different branch of
industry. It is told as characteristic of him that
on one occasion, when a lady asked for a certain
kind of Indian chutney, not at the time in stock,
she was requested to take a seat, while an employe
in a_ fast cab drove to the heart of the city to
obtain the article from the importer, which she
got for less than the usual retail price.
Furthermore, Whitely is an adept at attend-
ing to the comfort of his customers. Cosy wait-
ing-rooms are placed at the disposal of the women,
provided with papers, periodicals, writing
materials, and lavatories; while the men have
their smoking and lounging compartments. Even
the footmen are not forgotten, a room being set
aside for them,
Whitely, in building up his enormous trade, has
done so at the expense of dozens, nay hundreds,
of smaller fry. He has mercilessly run them to
the ground, and left them no alternative but to
abandon the struggle. His ever increasing wealth
has allowed him to conduct some departments of
his business at a dead loss, in order to stifle com-
petition, and thus at times goods could be purchased
from him 25 per cent, below the cost of production.
It is needless to add that the public only derived
these advantages so long as the rival held out. Such
methods, causing as they did untold misery in
many quarters, naturally excited the bitterest
animosity against the “Wizard,” lending colour
to the latter’s assertion that the conflagrations
from which he has suffered during the past few
years were due to incendiarism. His various fires
have cost him a fortune, for, owing to the
irregular construction of his buildings, no insur-
ance company has been willing to undertake to
pay him full value for his losses. The fire of 1884
alone cost him £240,000 over and above the insur-
ance money, and since that period the companies
have doubled his rates.
The number of Whitely’s employes varies
between 5500 and 6500, but more often it
approaches the latter figure. The problem that
must present itself to a man of his calibre under
these circumstances is how to keep so large an
army under perfect discipline at the lowest
possible expense. Whitely’s sole object in life is
to increase his own fortune, and he has turned his
emporium into a huge money-making machine,
each component part of which is only suffered to
exist so long as its usefulness is entirely unim-
paired. Every employe is not only a source of
profit to the house by reason of his ability to
dispose of its wares, but nolens nolens, its cus-
tomer. Whitely boards and lodgeshim and supplies
him with clothing, and thus practically makes
money at both ends. An average of sales is
expected from all salesmen and women in the
establishment, and those who fall below it are
very quickly made to realise the fact. The conse-
quence is that many customers have been en-
treated to purchase on the ground that a failure to
effect a sale would result in the discharge of tha
employ^; and though such declarations may
occasionally be false, the fact that they are made
at all shows to what depths the general poverty
among the London lower middle classes has caused
its members to descend.
It is the very intensity of this struggle for exist-,
ence in London that renders it possible for a
Whitely and a Shoolbred to coop up 6000 human
beings within the limits of a shop between eight
in the morning and eight at night, and within
those of huge penitentiary-like dwellings from
ten at night until daybreak. For all the enjoy-
ment these unfortunate beings derive from their
metropolitan life they might just as well be
caged in a gaol, for their short term of
liberty in the evening renders any social enjoy-
ment out of the question. Their rooms are the
boarded compartments of a huge dormitory,
sombre and forbidding, in which, despite all
efforts to secure proper ventilation, a tainted
atmosphere must necessarily predominate. Three
is the usual number of occupants of one partition,
but sometimes there are as many as five in a space
14 xl6 feet in dimensions. Whitely, however, is
not stingy in the matter of food. lloast beef and
mutton form the staple of his dinners, with an
occasional dish of fowl or an Irish stew. He also
allows each man and woman a good mug of ale.
His cooks and scullions form a small army by
themselves. As showing that the man is less to
be blamed, perhaps, than the system he repre-
sents, it might be added that he does not alto-
gether neglect the recreation of his assistants.
During the winter as many as half-a-dozen balls
are sometimes held under his auspices, and among
the employes are established a dramatic company,
a concert society, a minstrel troupe, cricket and
rowing clubs, &c.
His experiences have taught him that the
chances of a big business succeeding where a small
one will fail are just about ten to one. ‘‘For
instance,” says he, “if we allow a man, say,
.£IOOO a year for his private expenses, and he has
only one shop, he must make .£IOOO net profit out
of that shop to live; but if another man has ten
shops, he need only to make .£IOO per annum out
of each, and yet he is as well off as the one
who has only one shop; besides, the larger the
trade the better the advantages in every way,
the larger dealer being able to buy at first hand
and save the profits of middlemen, and, in
many instances, being able to become the manu-
facturer of what he sells.” In answer to the
charge of unfairness in investing in so many
different businesses, Whitely says: “I believe in a
man investing his money in any way he likes,
but it should be invested, and not hoarded up.
He should circulate, pay rent, taxes, increase the-
trade in gas, coal, water, and give employment
to the greatest number of people possible, and
thus indirectly benefit the community at large. 1
do not own to any limit. The world is my
parish, and I have a perfect right to do business
in any or all parts of it, in as many different ways
as I think proper, so that I do alLjionourably and
lawfully.”—V.G. in the Argonaut^
X.L. : “ I have turned up, in the London
Guardian (church paper), a droll, long letter from
Bishop Webber, of Queensland, written a year
or two ago. It was beseeching for young English
clergy to come on engagements of only five years
to benighted Bnnanaland. The Bishop urged that
they might postpone marriage till their return,
and there would be no occasion to associate too
closely with the population in any way.”

Into His Hand!
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Lean and mangy was Damal. Dirty brass
rings had corroded his ear-lobes, and elephantiasis
had magnified one leg into monstrous contrast
with the tenuity of its fellow. His age no man
might guess, for your Dyak—putting on not
seldom at 30 the externals of 60—may yet look no
whit older when 60 comes in earnest. At all
events, Damal had brains in his head, and knew
it; whereas, with Bollard, the sago-trader, the
case was exactly converse. This also Damal
knew, which was why, since he couldn’t sneer—
because his face was a crystallised sneer already—
there issued now from his betel-charged mouth
the squirt-contemptuous.
“Two rice-sowings ago earnest thou to Laupo,
thou white man wondrous wise ; and many a time
since hast thou asked of the white man who was
here before thee. Thou thinkest he is of the
drowned. I tell thee—no ! Into no crocodile’s
belly went Mason, the white man !”
Bollard had been listening with one ear ; now
he opened both. “There might be something in
this old banana-skin’s jabber, after all! ’
“ Not of the drowned, my father? ” he asked in
bad Malay, “ Yes, surely of the drowned was
he ! Do not all men say it ? ”
“Am not I a man, and say not I the other way ?
What became of him I know, and none but I! ”
And Damal bared to the gums his black triangular
fangs.
Bollard sprang up and laid his iron hand on the
Dyak’s pipe-stem arm.
“ Look here, you old villain ! there’s some in-
fernal mischief in this, and you’re at the bottom
of it. Speak out, you grinning little devil! Own
up, or I’ll shake the bones out of your shiny old
carcase! ”
Unthinkingly he spoke in English, but Damal
understood the angry eye and clutching hand.
“Mighty art thou, O white master! and
Damal’s strength is but smoke. Yet canst thou
not make him say one word unless it please him
well. But please him now it doth ; else had he
not spoken at all. Therefore take off thy hand,
and come with me; thou shalt see Mason, the
white man! ”
Bollard let go the arm and looked to his re-
volver.
“ Ay ! see to thy fire-pip ! Thou wilt have use
for it before this night is over! ”
# # *
Under the meridian moon slept the great
lake Kapasi, without a sound upon the midnight
silence, without a flaw upon the mighty mirror
stretching far away to where, in faint, mysterious
shadow, the Batang-Lupar mountains rose against
the pellucid sky. Slowly, under Damal’s weakly
paddle-strokes, went the boat, with Bollard, grim
and wondering, in the stern. Out amongst the
earthquake-scattered islets, mangrove-fringed,
save here and there where deeper water and a
steeper shore were told of by the broad-leaved
nipas, stooping from the banks. At last an island
worthy of the name, on which, above the tangled
tropic growth, there reared itself a battlemented
mass of black volcanic rock.
Alongside Damal brought the boat. “ Now,
get thee out,” he said, “ and follow me !” And
through the dew-drenched leafage Bollard scram-
bled, wondering more and more. Up and up
—till in their way direct stood the sombre
wall of rock. Along this Damal searched till,
with his foot, he touched a partly-earth-sunk
stone—a rough-angled slab of two feet square.
“ This could I raise alone,” he muttered, “when
last I was in this place. But not so now !”
gripped the edge and turned the slab

A little, steep-walled amphitheatre, into which
the moon shone full upon a stirless quadrupedal
figure, pedestalled black and solitary in the centre.

hard “ ,s ankle, shrieked :
“What seest thou, white man? Go up! In
the name of all thy gods, go up, I say ! .
, Bollard went up, and Damal followed, quaking;
but when the owl—for it was but an owl after all-
flapped silently away, his tremors left him and he

should see him .
Behold him . he is there, and Damal coolly
changed his quid as he pointed to the mournful
bones. But sit, 1 say, and I will tell thee all!
“ This white man, Mason, as thou may st have
heard, was one of those who say the peoples of the
D y aks are of Indi b,ood 5 and much he talked
and man y reasons gave to prove it. For that, I
know not; but this do I know—my father s
father, who in secret knew of this temple of the
Bull whose name is Brahma, did thereof tell my

message thus passed on for sowing-times uncount-
able—how that, when at this black bull’s feet a
white man’s head should fall, our race should pass
again unto that land beyond the sunset whence
long ago it came.”
On Bollard’s darkness rose at last a gleam,
His eyes began to burn ; his hand stole half-way
to his belt. And Damal, watching sideways, saw,
but made no sign.
“ I told the white man of this place—the Rock,
the Temple, and the Bull; and rest thereafter
gave he me little till I should bring him hither,
The bull, he said, was surely Indi-work, like
others he had seen amongst the Dyaks of the
North. Well—we came!”
Bollard’s hand dropped lightly on his pistol-
butt, lingered a moment—then went back to his
beard ; and yet again Damal, sideways watching.
saw and smiled.
“We came ! and, as he stooped before the feet
of Brahma ”
Full and firm came this time the white man’s
grasp upon his pistol—“ You killed him? ”
“I killed” the pistol-crack scared whooping
into air the owl that had again by this time settled
on the statue of the bull.
* # *
“ Thou hast in this but worked my will, 0
white man, wondrous wise ! ” and in the very
door of death the bitter spirit laughed. “ Half
only of the message did I tell to thee. First was
there here to be slain by one of us a white man—
but thereafter by a white man one of us—before
the end should come. Now all is done, and I am
well content.”
ALEX. MONTGOMERY.
He Never Could See.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
He never could see that it had been from any
fault of his ; but posed as a martyr, rather enjoy-
ing than otherwise the chance which had brought
him before public notice.
If his sympathisers could have peeped behind
the scenes during the dozen years intervening
between his marriage and the running-off of his
wife with another man, leaving him alone and
childless, the general opinion might not have been
what it was—that a model husband had been
heartlessly dishonoured.
He had never had any feeling either way, with
regard to his mother-in-law, condescending to
wear the fine silk socks she knitted, and lazily
welcoming her on the rare occasions when
she travelled the hundred miles to visit
her daughter —an only child passionately
devoted to the one parent she remembered.
He placidly accepted the many additional luxuries
which appeared simultaneously with her arrival.
Her money would die with her, so the present was
most to be considered.
And when she developed an incurable and ter-
rible disease, at a comparatively early age, he was
truly distressed, because his wife went about all
day with red eyelids and a swollen nose.
“ For goodness sake take the best doctors you
can get, either here or up North, and insist upon
a consultation. Surely, surely there must be
something they can do ?”
“You really care, then?” she cried, brightening
up.
“Can you doubt it, Milly?” So she acted at
once on his suggestion and arranged to start by
first train in company with the doctors.
As she said good-bye—“ It is so good of you,
George,” she whispered, “I never thought you
cared much for mother.”
“Silly little woman.” Then the train moved
on. “ Mind you don’t be later than to-morrow ;
you know I’ll be so anxious to hear your news,”
With a grateful smile she passed out of sight.
She came down punctually next day, with a
longer face than before; there was no hope; incur-
able, and certain to die within a given time, had
been the verdict.
“I must go back, George, she wants me with
her, and, oh, I can’t bear to lose a moment of her
now,” sobbing heavily.
“ Well, you might go up again for a couple of
days, but you certainly must come down for
Wednesday night.”
“Why?”
“ Have you forgotten the Masonic ball ? ”
“ I can’t go now—you couldn’t ask it.”
“I consider you entirely selfish to say that.
The Masons will decide the election, and if we ar«
absent they will notice it, to a man.”
“ I don’t believe it would make the least differ-
ence to one of them, when they hear the reason.”
“ Oh, well, of course you’ll go your own way.
You know my ambition, and if I don’t succeed you
can blame yourself—unless you come to that
ball.”
So she came, tired to death with the long
journey after two sleepless nights, racked with
constant dread of a telegram calling her back,
sickened with anticipation of the inevitable
impending parting.
She moved like a ghost through the merry
dancers, with white face and cold, irresponsive
manner. The Masons voted her a heartless icicle.
He was hail-fellow with everyone. The women
found him charming as he complimented them
upon their vivacity with an apparently involun-
tary glance at his own emotionless wife.
The Masons voted him a gentleman “in every
word and deed,” with significant regret that ha
had married unsuitably.
She went up again, and, at a week’s end,
received a wire recalling her immediately.
With added apprehension she appeared at home
that night, a little worn-out being.
“ I think it jolly rough on me,” was his greet-
ing. “Here I’ve been alone for a week. How
long is this to go on ?”
“ Did you bring me all this way to answer
that?” —her tired eyes lighting up.
“ Didn’t you begin to feel your duty lay in this
direction?”
She took stock of the “ stalled-ox ” figure and
rosy, contented face; he had not risen from his
cosy chair even to welcome her.
“Mother is dying; do you realise that?” she
demanded.
“Perfectly; but’’—flipping the ash from his
cigarette—“ she may last ever so long, and why
you want to hang around distressing yourself
needlessly beats me altogether.”
A pause, during which he puffed comfortably
with closed eyes, while she with scarlet cheeks
and anguished features fought for self-control;
which was swept beyond her by his next remark,
uttered rather as a surmise than a question of
death.
“Isuppose when the poor old thing croaks I’ll
have to go up to the funeral?”
With truest bravery she suppressed the scathing
words which rose as retort.
Returning to her mother’s side by the cattle-
train which passed at midnight, she waited till all
was done, and then concluded to stay on with the
doctor who had given more than professional
sympathy in her hour of need.
The world condemned her without dissent.
At the election her husband went in flying, a
splendid fellow, a real man, who bore his trouble
wonderfully.
How any woman could do other than worship
such a husband his world never could see.

“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty well on a par. The
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these faraway
parts. A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—S.M. Herald, July 8, 1893.
“ No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of this is that
he has, by many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer.
He, too, possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best work. That they will be widely read is certain.”— Sydney Mail, July 8, 1893.
“ They present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen in wild places
when human hearts are stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. * The Last of Six ’ is a terrible
tale of cannibalism, treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr. Favenc makes of
thrilling interest. ‘The Haunt of the Jinkarras’ suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some extent, but is itself relieved from the
suspicion of imitation by faithful local colour and a grotesquerie of conception, in which Mr. Favenc here and there approaches Poe. This
characteristic is especially noticeable in ‘Spirit Led,’ which the great American might have written. ‘ A Cup of Cold Water’ is, perhaps, the
best tale in a collection that should be widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to .purely Australian literature.' —Daily Telegraph,
July 15, 1893.
“‘The Last of Six ;’and other stories. By Ernest Favenc. (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co.) This is a collection of short but
graphic sketches by Mr. Favenc, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here are good,
and we can heartily endorse the recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third of JHE
Bulletin series of Australian reminiscences.”— Australian Star, July 15, 1893.
