Victorians
Victorianism isn’t a matter of country
or period ; it is an attitude of mind.
Walpole and Chesterton are Victorian,
Shaw isn’t; Wagner was, Saint-Saens
wasn’t. Max Beerbohm is no more Vic-
torian than Anatole France was ; Mark
Twain was as Victorian in his sentimen-
talism, his humor, his respect for com-
mercial rectitude and domestic virtue as
Dickens.
The celebrities whose biographies are
reviewed below were different in nation-
ality, social origins, religion, education,
environment and the arts which made
them famous, but they belonged to the
same spiritual family. In their pre-
occupations with national patriotism and
the moralities, in their romanticism, in
their ideas of beauty, and in their belief
in hard work as the only road to success,
they were children of Albert the Good.
4 Cosmopolitan
Rom Landau in Paderewski (Nichol-
son and Watson; 18s.) recognises that
the statesman-pianist’s career is over;
there are no reticences. It was appro-
priate that Paderewski should have been
knighted last year by the King, who is
himself an embodiment of the Victorian
tradition.
Paderewski appeared as a virtuoso in
an age whose conceptions of beauty are
sneered at now. Burne-Jones was paint-
ing young knights and women who were
very like Paderewski in appearance. The
eyes and thoughts of fashionable wits
and writers like Wilde, and of fashion-
able painters like Alma-Tadema, were
fixed on ancient Greece—or rather on
the Rome of the Empire which had ab-.
sorbed the culture of the Greeks, and
which reminded the English ruling classes
of their own Imperial mission. The
young Pole was a predestined success in
England. He supplied all that the early
’nineties asked of an artist. Firstly, and
above all, technique. The musicians
painters, poets and writers whom our
young cubists, surrealists and so on
deride at least learned their jobs before
facing the public.
When asked one day how he had
achieved his tremendous success, Paderew-
ski answered: “My success is due one
per cent, to tatent, nine per cent, to luck
and ninety per cent, to work.”
Everything he did aimed at an effect
of classical unity. It was not enough
that his fingers should be more supple
than those of any other pianist, or that
he should be capable of weeping at the
nostalgia of a Chopin nocturne; his
erect seat at the piano, his walk across
the platform, his smile and bow to the
audience—all represented constant prac-
tice, merciless self-discipline.
Women adored him. In London, Paris,
Vienna, New York they used to crowd
on to his platform and cover him with
flowers. Yet Disraeli himself was not
a more devoted and impeccable husband,
and he had a puritan intolerance of the’
lapses of his friends. “Paderewski,” says
his biographer, “expected in others his
own high moral standards.”
His patriotism was of a kind which is
often found in the nationals of oppressed
races. He had the romantic love for
Poland which Irish exiles have for Erin.
He was like many Irish patriots in
another respect; when it came to buying
1 a home to live in he chose Riond Bosson
Inear Lausanne. He left it to become
IPrime Minister of Poland shortly before
Vthe Peace Conference of Versailles, which
vie attended as Poland’s delegate, and he
Went back when Pilsudski engineered his
lownfall in 1920.
\ He has known everybody of import-
Aice in the civilised world during the
fist forty years, and his appraisements

admre Shaw as much as most Poles do?”
A \ “I mistrust cynicism, and I value
pahdox only up to a point.... I much
f Galsworthy.” Of Richard Strauss:
Of r\ S ® German composer.”
?L\ loy i Q J° : £ . Charmi 'ng, but his
greaj misfortune is his lack of stability.
and his apparent
lack of principle.”
Of Balfour: “One
of the purest
characters I have
met If ever
there was a true
gentleman, it was Balfour.” Queen Vic-
toria liked Paderewski, and was deeply
moved by his playing, and a large signed
photograph of her ornaments his piano.
The Complete Englishman
Herman Ould’s John Galsworthy
(Chapman and Hall ; Bs. 6d.) reveals a
man with Paderewski’s passion for'tech-
nical perfection, with his austerity of life
and with his patriotism and ideals of
beauty. Paderewski was uncritical of
Poland, and Galsworthy was extremely
critical of almost every phase of English
life, but it only means that the one coun-
try needed encouragement while the
other didn’t.
This was a son of England; in his heart
Dwelt charity and justice and a scorn
Ol those who play the easier baser part
And sully the fair land where they were
born.
Galsworthy saw all England’s faults,
but, like many another critic, he
wouldn’t have thought of living any-
where else. He had Paderewski’s dis-
like of freakishness in music, writing,
painting and sculpture. “Joyce,” he
wrote in 1927, “seems to me to be going
dotty,” and he thought Epstein’s “Rima”
“gauche, ungracious, unbeautiful.”
His best-known characters—Soames,
Old Jolyon, Fleur and a dozen more-
have the appearance and qualities of
mind and heart of Thackeray’s charac-
ters ; they are mid-Victorian residents of
the West End in modern clothes. Gals-
worthy’s habit of moralising through the
mouths of his characters and of using
their misfortunes to point arguments in
favor of social and legal reforms was
also essentially Victorian, and he hated
plain speech about sex.
Perhaps his most conspicuously Vic-
torian quality was his reserve in social
intercourse. The average modern intel-
lectual is an alert publicity-getter, a
mixer, a boon to photographers. Gals-
worthy belonged in spirit to an age when
great writers lived laborious days and
scorned ballyhoo. He had no particular
religion ; as his biographer notes: “Gals-
worthy would have found it difficult to
believe in a doctrine which gave immor-
tality to men and denied it to animals.”
Though he had no doctrinal beliefs, he
never challenged the beliefs of others;
and that, too, was to be expected of a
well-bred Victorian.
RED PAGE.
Uphill, by John Evelyn Wrench (Nich-
olson and Watson ; Bs. 6d.), describes the
early struggles of a patriot. The author
found himself flung on the world at the
beginning of the century with little but
health, money, an Eton education, in-
fluential friends, and parents who wanted
him to enter the Diplomatic Service.
His first call came in 1900, when he was
seventeen. He happened to be with his
mother, who had been taking the cure at
Carlsbad, when the excellence of the
German postcards impressed him :
I had often read about young men who
struck'out for themselves. Why should I
not do something spectacular? Start a
business and make sufficient money to go
into Parliament and become the great
expert in Empire matters?
This was the genesis of his celebrated
postcard business. He interviewed “lead-
ing printing firms at Dresden and Leip-
zig ; ascertained that if he “ordered 25,000
postcards at a time they would only cost
13s. 6d. per thousand, plus freight”;
realised that the arrangement would
leave him “with a clear pound a thou-
sand, or a farthing on every card.”
Another Empire industry was born. His
postcards boomed for a while (at the
was employing a staff of
100) and then slumped.
xr He , feaffie Private secretary to Lord
Northchffe in 1904 ; the uphill struggle
was virtually over. He was made sub-
editor of the “Daily Mail” (overseas
edition) in 1904, editor of the “Weekly

H
Dispatch” in 1905, a director of the
“World” in the same year. Then the
Chief moved him back on to his per-
sonal staff to act as a kind of “watch-
dog” in addition to other duties.
For some years I went out much in
society. I enjoyed meeting people whose
names appeared in the papers and who
achieved things. It gratified my vanity to
see those large bits of pasteboard inviting
me to “have the honor of meeting their
Royal Highnesses so and so” stuck round
my looking-glass.... I enjoyed wearing
knee-breeches and silk stockings and the
thought that my legs looked rather nice. In
my heart of hearts I despised social
climbers, but I fear I was more or less of
a snob.
The most urgent message of his life
arrived in May, 1910. His diary records:
“Saw the King’s funeral from the Marl-
borough Club, where I was in the greatest
comfort.” At the Memorial Service in
the Abbey that afternoon he listened to
five different funeral marches. The organ
“caught up his soul” ; he was “shaken
to the foundations of his being.” The
“scales fell from his eyes: party al-
legiance fell from him like a worn-out
garment.” He vowed then and there to
devote the rest of his life to the Empire.
His Overseas Club and Empire Cru-
sade followed. He grew to like Aus-
tralia, though he “writhed inwardly when
some local patriot got up on the plat-
form and preached a Jingo ‘lmperialism’
entirely different from the doctrine he
believed in.” His sister found what she
called “an Imperialist’s lot” even harder.
She shared the privations of his Queens-
land tour in 1913.
If you fail to appear punctually for
lunch at one o’clock and dinner at six-
thirty, the greasy soup will be cold, likewise
the tinned vegetables The food is thrust
at you by smart young “ladies” who, con-
descending to wait, are in a hurry to be off
to the Pictures or the Skating Rink.
The book ends just before the war, in
which he did his bit as private secretary
to the president of the Air Ministry (Lord
Rothermere). He was given a C.M.G.
in 1917, and a knighthood in 1932.
Uphill is valuable, in spite of its
odd blend of journalese and parsonese,
as a picture of a type of Empire-builder
who is well known in Australia, and as
a lesson to young Britons in the art of
rising in the world. It might well be
made a textbook at Eton, Winchester,
and one or two more schools.
D.
Monotheism
In Truth and Tradition (Angus and
Robertson; 4s. 6d.) Dr. Angus has
gathered together the teachings at St.
Andrew’s College (where he is Professor
of New Testament and Historical Theo-
logy) and elsewhere which have led to
what his dust-jacket calls “the Angus
heresy case.”
There is nothing new about his argu-
ments ; Rationalists have been using them
for generations. He denies the Virgin
Birth, the Resurrection, the Trinity, the
sinlessness and Deity of the Saviour, the
God of the Old Testament, the supreme
authority of the New Testament; and so
on. He accepts the Christian ethic, and
stresses in many eloquent passages that
the Saviour was a true Son of God; a
sublimely great and good man. He did
not die to save us.
Jesus laid down his life in the interests
of the kingdom of God, and for the love
of his fellow-men. He did not lay it down
to placate God or to offer an expiation.
The whole of the issues as between
Dr. Angus and his critics may be reduced
to one: his denial of the Trinity. As
Dr. Macintyre is reported by the Sydney
dailies to have said: “We Presbyterians
belong to a Trinitarian church.” Dr.
Angus does not even recognise the need
for clergymen (“Our God to-day requires
not the offices of a mediator or priest”),
and here he is more courageous than
Bishop Barnes, who, though he has re-
vealed his disbelief in the Thirty-nine
Articles from Unitarian pulpits, has never
gone so far as to hint that ecclesiasticism
may be dispensed with.
Though Dr. Angus’s matter is old, it
is presented with astonishing freshness
and charm. You can hear all through
this little book the voice of a good and
earnest man who is stating the truth as
it appears to him, without heed of the
consequences.

A Publisher on Terra Firma
I am certainly grateful to the contri-
butor who, in “A Publisher at Sea” (R.P.
25./4/’34), asserts that “it is good to see
this evidence of the new venture in be-
ing,” and who affirms, moreover, that
“Mr. Stephensen has a great goal ahead.”
If the last statement is intended to mean
anything, it at least justifies that ven-
ture, and hints that there is yet some-
thing to be done by publishers in Aus-
tralia. The rest of his article—in which
he multiplies my obligations to him—
both your readers and yourself will no
doubt expect me to reply to. I shall do
this as briefly as possible.
That the late George Robertson’s ges-
ture was a not ungenerous one I under-
stood as well as your contributor. That
was one reason for my recording it. But
this surely was not to “denigrate” him.
The article makes much of the sup-
posed fact that the authors mentioned
by me published their work in London
because “they happened to be living
there.” This, however, brings me to the
point of my indictment. Why did they
“happen to be living there”? Was the
abandonment of their own country by
most of the writers mentioned such a
haphazard matter as the writer suggests?
Did they leave it, for instance, merely
because they wanted a holiday abroad?
And, if so, why did they remain there?
They were am bitious writers; and ambi-
tious writers need publishers ; and—well,
perhaps the inference can be left to your
readers.
Referring to the Lindsays, your con-
tributor says: “Jack Lindsay left Aus-
tralia many years ago. He had no ‘Rome
for Sale’ to offer then, nor had Philip
Lindsay produced anything like ‘Panama
Is Burning’ when he left.” These writers,
not less than others, understood their own
possibilities; and the business in front
of them also, as they likewise under-
stood, required publishers ; and —if cause
and effect are what they always have been
—they left Australia, as I affirmed in the
paragraph questioned, to seek those pub-
lishers. With the proper facilities in Aus-
tralia for giving their productions to the
world, is it too much to believe that these
writers, and such as these, might easily
have left Rome and Panama, or what-
ever it has turned out to be, to other
writers, and given us Australian works
which are now lost to us?
Among the poets mentioned, I need
only set down the facts about Brennan.
“The Chant of Doom,” the publication
of which is cited by your contributor,
was a minor production, and was doubt-
less published merely because it was, to
some extent at least, topical, and there-
fore likely to be quickly saleable. But
Brennan’s real work, his “Poems” —
which, if the publishers of this country
had cared anything whatever about its
literature, would have been published in
full long ago—was allowed to go
begging for print. It is doing so to this
day. And Brennan, as everyone knows,
did not go to London to seek publishers.
He stopped in Australia, and could have
been found in half an hour by any pub-
lisher interested. The case of Brennan
alone justifies me.
If so much of the work of our best
authors has never been offered to any
Australian publisher, will your con-
tributor permit me to ask why? Is
it because publishers in Australia
have never won the confidence of those
writers of ours who matter? If so,
there is indeed “a great goal ahead.”
It will be useless to reply here that the
Australian publisher could not reach the
world market envisaged by these writers.
A first publication in Australia is no bar
whatever to a world publication later.
And, to repeat it, we want our best
writers to remain here, and give us works
vital to Australia. We can ensure this
only by providing them with publishers
for the sort of work they produce—that
is, we must make Australia a country
that can publish them.
In conclusion, your contributor asserts
that “accuracy of statement is a fine
asset in a maker of books.” Waiving this
quibbling, what I in turn recommend to
your writer is accuracy of understanding
—an accuracy even more profitable. The
facts are, in everything that matters, just
what my article asserts they are ; and
your contributor, it seems to me, has
merely helped to substantiate them.

“Marlbrook”
A “Red Page” contributor (18/4/’34)
mentions “Marlbrook” with some other
national anthems in his criticism of the
Melbourne ode competition. This ditty
has nothing to do with the Duke of Marl-
borough, except inasmuch as it was
revived at the time of his victories.
Marlbrook s’en va-t-en guerre:
Ne sgait quand reviendra
is not modern French. The lines and
melody date from the days of the early
Crusades. The original person thus im-
mortalised was Mambron, a celebrated
troubadour of the Middle Ages, and the
melody was brought from the East by
the Crusaders.
G. D.
A Satchel of Books
In Sara Alone (Heinemann; 7s. 6d.),
N. S. Leitch relates the story of the spiri-
tual martyrdom of a woman to the
caprice of a selfish genius. Married at 20
to Phillip Vandelt, an artist, Sara finds
him lacking in sympathy and under-
standing. She, however, is the type that
serves, asking no reward, and Phillip is
so helpless that she can’t leave him. The
author conveys the husband’s helpless-
ness and futility very skilfully; in her
attempt to arouse sympathy for him she
is not so successful.
What is the expectation of life of a
comic-strip personality—a Mickey Mouse
or a Ginger Meggs? It can be a serious
problem for some artists who create one
popular figure, and are unable to think
of another. Walt Disney is one of the
few who will never be embarrassed in
that way. It was said the other day that
the possibilities of Mickey Mouse were
about exhausted, that the kids were tiring
of him. Disney promptly evolved the
Big Bad Wolf, and it has created a
greater furore than Mickey ever did.
The Wolf has now arrived in book form
from John Lane, with illustrations in
color, at 2s. 6d. The Three Little Pigs
is the best children’s book, both for chil-
dren and adults, now on the market at
anything near the price.
Margot Robert Adamson’s Render
Unto Ccesar (Dent; 7s. 6d.) is hard read-
ing. Her constant philosophisings obscure
the somewhat thin story. The descrip-
tive passages, of towns, of bits of coun-
try, of men, are well done, and conditions
in mediaeval Germany are painted with
a sure touch and sympathy ; but there is
too much writing of this kind:
That endless indecision flickered over his
face. At once boundlessly hopeful, bound-
lessly resigned, active yet incapable of
acting, brave yet flawed by a straw, the
emperor’s various, changeable face was like
a mirror, showing the pride of his nature,
reflecting one thing then another, uncertain,
dubious, not to be trusted, playing with,
severing and joining those interweaving
strands, pride and chivalry, dominion and
crafty action, a rainbow floating over the
disorder of the empire, radiant, visible,
yet intangible, fleeting.
Superstition Corner, by Sheila Kaye-
Smith (Cassell; Dymock’s ; 7s. 6d.), is
a fine novel, but it isn’t everybody’s meat.
The writer is a passionate believer in
Catholicism, and she sees Elizabethan
England with the eyes of a member of
the old faith. Her heroine, Catherine, is
a Sussex squire’s daughter, and, like
many of her class, a secret Romanist.
She hates the ways of the Court; hates,
too, the industrialism which is ruining
the appearance of her .beloved county.
Sixteenth-century England was far be-
hind her Continental enemies in the
metal-w®rking industries, and her bows
and arrows (incidentally, her bow staves
had to be imported from Germany) were
no match for the cannon of Spain'. All
England’s cannon were cast in Sussex
at the time. For Catherine “in the neigh-
borhood of Battle and Ashburnham
it was a ride from furnace to furnace.”
There is a ghastly description of the
execution of three priests, and the general
atmosphere is tragic. As a period piece
Superstition Comer is amazing within
the limitations mentioned ; but Cather-
ine’s world is worlds away from Shak-
speare’s England.
The venue of Charlton Andrews’s The
Butterfly Murder (Philip Allan; 2s. 6d.)
is Hollywood. The corpse, “clad only in
a flimsy undergarment of green silk, long
flesh-colored hose and a single shoe,” is
found in an unoccupied apartment.
“Wicked Hollywood” was again to the
fore. Another Butterfly had been broken
on the wheel of sin. One more Broken
Blossom lay stark and cold on a marble
slab.
Derek Whitby, one time of Scotland
Yard, bases his investigations on an in-
fallible hunch. Whenever he comes to
a dead-end he conveniently has the
hunch. He questions everybody, estab-
lishes motives and opportunities for a
half-dozen murders, then has a hunch
that the real murderer is a young man
with apparently neither motive nor
opportunity. He is.
Although E. Barrington died some time
ago she left several unpublished works.
In the latest of these, The Graces (Cas-
sell ; 7s. 6 # d.), she has told six stories of
remarkable women. The name-story
relates an episode in the career of
Edmund Waller, poet, courtier, fop and
egotist, who, anxious to contract a suc-
cessful marriage, and imagining himself
irresistible to women, courts two possible
brides at the same time, and, in addition,
seeks the favors of their maid. The three
take a subtle revenge upon the poet. In-
cidentally, fhe author seems to have read
rather more meaning than most people
into the “Sacharissa” and “Amoret”
poems. The waning dominance of Sarah,
Duchess of Marlborough, ove’r her
sovereign is the subject of another tale.
The best of the six is the one that re-
counts the strange friendship which
existed between Horace Walpole in his
old age and the Berry sisters—referred
to by him as his “Twin Wives.” It is
usually accepted that, after becoming
Earl of Orford, Horace proposed to
Mary Berry: this writer doesn’t think so.

WHY COMMUNISM GROWS.
Every election demonstrates the grow-
ing strength of the Communists. One
of them polled over 8000 votes in the
mayoral election in Brisbane. At the
Hamilton (N.S.W.) by-election another
got an even bigger proportion of sup-
port. Yet their Australian programme is
so extreme and violent and calls for so
complete a surrender to iron discipline
that, in a country with such easygoing
traditions, it is difficult to imagine any-
body but a madman or a crank support-
ing it. Many of those who do support it
are unbalanced by unemployment and
embittered by the complacency of un-
comprehending politicians politicians
who have become the slaves of professors
and whose minds have developed into
mere book-keeping machines. Sometimes
one wonders whether these politicians
know what is going on under their noses,
or whether their hearts are made of wet
cement, which seems to be the chief base
of their recovery plans.
Have they, for instance, seen the con-
ditions on the N.S.W. coalfields? Are
they aware that on both the northern and
southern fields there are literally thou-
sands who have cynically resigned them-
selves to make the best of the dole and
the family endowment for the rest of
their lives? Have they heard that there
are thousands more, youngsters just
beyond the school age, who have already
come to believe that if Communism
cannot do for them what the present
system has failed to do it will at least
give them sympathy?
Do Mr. Lyons and Mr. Stevens realise
the significance of the capture of the
Northern Miners’ Federation by the
Minority Movement? And do the two
brawling Labor parties ever pause to con-
sider the effect of the unequal conditions
as between employed and unemployed in
some of the mining districts? In the
Maitland region there is a mine which
has worked full time throughout the
depression. Its lowest-paid underground
worker in 1931—the direst of years—
earned £4OB for a 30-hour week; its
best-paid underground worker earned
£6BO, after paying for explosives and
meeting other deductions. Not far away
were hundreds of poor devils whose chil-
dren were without boots. On the Bulli
field, while the employees of one mine
were having the time of their lives,
women sat on their verandahs every after-
noon waiting for the hooter which blew
three or four times a fortnight to say
that there would be a shift next day.
In the first quarter of 1934 over 28
p.c. of all mining and quarrying em-
ployees in N.S.W. were registered as out
of work. But these figures are a travesty
on the real ones, for a huge addi-
tional proportion is reckoned as em-
ployed because the men make £4 or £5
a fortnight on rationed time.
All this vast huddle of despair is a
fruitful field for the Communist, the
more so because other parties have drawn
so much on Communist ideas and per-
sonnel. The Lang programme and ulti-
mate objective are very close to those of
the Communists. The head of the Lang
Inner Group is an ex-member of the
E.C.C.1., the world committee controlling
the Communist party. Labor will have
nothing to do with “rats”—so it says. It
will accept no converts from the U.A.P.
(though the U.A.P. accepts leaders from
Labor), but its ranks teem with ex-
Communists, some of whom maintain
connection with the party through mem-
bership of bodies which, while not inside
the Communist party, are doing its work.
Moreover, while the U.A.P. and the
A.L.P. approach the unemployed with
platitudes, the Communist party reaches
out to them with action. Let elderly people
dependent on the income from their
small properties try to get rid of tenants
who can’t or won’t pay, and you read
something like this in some Communist
paper:
We have to recognise at once that there
are over 7000 workers threatened with evic-
tions. Every branch of the Unemployed
Workers’ Movement must immediately
organise strong anti-eviction committees
and give the lead to the workers to prevent
them occurring.
Instructions on “What do to when
arrested” are issued. Workers are urged
to “use the camera to expose police ter-
rorism,” and the alleged results are
utilised for propaganda. There is a body
which “exists to assist and defend any
worker arrested for activity in the Labor
movement.” Another looks after his
wife and children while he is in
gaol. Half a score of others combine to
make a public martyr of him. Mean-
while there is an increasing flood of
literature promising £5 15s. per week for
a 30-hour week, a wage whether em-
ployed or not, and an ultimate share in
the division of the spoils of the revolu-
tion. It is a positive programme, inten-
sively preached in every industrial dis-
trict and union in the country through
the cell system ; and it is a tribute to the
sound sense of the average workers that
it lures so few of them.
At the same time, danger lies ahead.
Other programmes seem to consist largely
of wet cement and self-praise. Other
parties go in for sordid and interminable
wrangles ; if the Communists have their
internal bickerings they are not paraded.
Moreover, such relief work as is given is
nationalised, a fact which enables the
Communist agitator to claim that “capi-
talism has broken down,” and that Gov-
ernments which profess that socialism is
anathema to them have had to fall back
on Moscow principles.
Communism will have to be taken
more seriously. There is a sure cure for
it which transcends Crimes Acts and in-
effective prohibitions— permanent work
and plenty of it. That can be provided
only when the parties now in power
devote some of the energy which they
now exhaust in snarling to lightening the
tax-burden on industry, placing wages on
an equitable average level and allowing
employers to shake off the load which
prevents them from expanding their busi-
nesses. And employers themselves must
apply themselves to the problem of de-
veloping more intimate and friendly
human relationships, based on an under-
standing of the workers’ needs and trials,
than now exists under the “system” of
industrial arbitration, which has become
a curse and a laughing-stock.
LET’S HAVE THE WHOLE
TRUTH.
The Bulletin has received another state-
ment from the Minister for Defence
regarding his department’s treatment of
the late Lieutenant-Commander Casey,
R.A.N. It begins with an assertion that
The Bulletin was “definitely incorrect”
in saying that the Lieut.-Commander
had been medically reported as “entirely
recovered.”
Here is the sworn evidence, given in
the Coroner’s Court, of the Macquarie-
street specialist (he has since become
president of the 8.M.A.) who was com-
missioned to examine Lieut.-Commander
Casey, and who did so first on August
22 and secondly on September 30:
He [Casey] had had neurasthenia in
1930 for three months. After that he re-
mained perfectly well in every respect.
Though he felt fit, he did not feel fit for
his special work. I could find no sign
of organic disease. I thought him suffering
from “anxiety neurosis” On September
30 I again examined him. 7 found that
the “anxiety state” was no longer evi-
dent .... It is a matter of surprise to me
that he was discharged as being below the
Navy standard.
The rest of the Minister’s statement
consists of what is described as “a brief
history of the case.” The history is pre-
luded by a paragraph requesting that
“the details be not published.” The Bul-
letin complies all the more readily in-
asmuch as the confidential paragraph
doesn’t contain a single disclosure that
it hasn’t already made.
Of course, as the Minister says, a
naval medical board’s findings are
secret: so are those of a court-martial.
But a time comes in both cases when
the findings have to be put into effect;
when the alleged detrimental has to learn
if he has been adjudged unfit for the
service on ethical or on physical grounds.
The Bulletin’s charge against the
Defence Department is that Lieut.-Com-
mander Casey’s medical board no more
recommended his discharge from the
R.A.N. than the specialist who had exam-
ined him a few days previously did ; it
says that the board recommended that
he should be given a spell of shore ser-
vice. In short, that he should be treated
as many overworked R.N. and R.A.N.
officers were treated during the war.
Remains the question of compensa-
tion. The Minister implies that the rea-
sons why the Lieut.-Commander was not
compensated have been kept secret “out
of regard to the feelings of the relatives.”
The relatives have informed The Bulle-
tin that the department showed so little
regard for the feelings of Lieut.-Com-
mander Casey’s mother that it did not
send her the customary message of con-
dolence on his death —a message which
the Imperial authorities sent her when
her other son went down with his sub-
marine in the North Sea.
When Lieut.-Commander Casey went
to Jervis Bay as a boy of 13 he was an
A 1 subject, physically, morally and men-
tally: he had to be. Each of these lads
is subjected to a rigorous medical ex-
amination, with particular reference to
epilepsy and allied tendencies. His
father, like other fathers of Jervis Bay
entrants, had to sign a declaration that
there was no history of mental trouble
in the family. All through his ser-
vice, except for an appendicitis opera-
tion, he had no period of sickness whatr
ever. He had his first breakdown (in-
somnia) after the terrific work involved
in the 12 months’ course, and special
advanced (w./t.) course, in England four
years ago. If any disability from which
he subsequently suffered was not due,
in the circumstances, to Service condi-
tions, then no member of the R.A.N.
can hope to collect compensation in
future unless he is actually wounded in
the face of the enemy.
If Lieut.-Commander Casey was not
found medically unfit to remain in the
R.A.N. by his last medical board, why
was he discharged from the service? If
he was found medically unfit, why wasn’t
he compensated? These are the ques-
tions which The Bulletin has been ask-
ing all along. It is now in a position to
assure the Defence Department that the
late Lieut.-Commander’s relatives will be
glad of a reply in which all the facts are
revealed.
TASMANIA, TOO.
Albert George Ogilvie, leader of the
Tasmanian Labor Opposition, is the
latest to talk secession. When Albie was
eight years of age, the Tasmanians de-
cided to join the Commonwealth, and in
proportion to electoral population the
vote they gave for it was the greatest of
a 11—13,437 for and 791 against. The people
of that generation were moved by senti-
ments which make small appeal to the
dashing young Labor politicians of to-
day. Not that Mr. Ogilvie and his
friends are out to destroy the Federation.
Far from it.
But if the State claims its rights in a
reasonable and proper manner and the
Commonwealth refuses to proffer substan-
tial guarantees for the required change, the
Labor party will ask the people to decide
by plebiscite whether they desire that Tas-
mania should continue to be a State of the
Commonwealth or seek the status of a
dominion of the British Empire.
Newfoundland once sought the same
“status”—too successfully. It is now
back on Father Bull’s hands, and its wor-
ried parent has had to find large sums
to keep it going. The prospect of set-
ting up other small dominions which
may go bung, as Newfoundland did, is
unlikely to please.
Mr. Ogilvie does not refer specifically
to the “rights” which are to be “claimed
in a reasonable and proper manner,” but
presumably they relate to Government
finance. Anyway, the grievances he men-
tions are wholly financial.
In the last 35 years of pre-Federation
there were in Tasmania 18 deficits and 17
surpluses. In the first 324 years of Federa-
tion there were six small surpluses and 27
deficits.
Obviously the young gentleman has
gone to ex-Premier McPhee’s last Finan-
cial Statement for his summary. If
December 31, 1900, may be taken as
ending the last pre-Federation year, he is
right as to half of it, and wildly wrong
as to the other half. For the year to
December 31, 1901, there was a deficit
of £44,200, and the local Government
was principally responsible. The Com-
monwealth did not take over the Postal
Department till March of that year, and
uniform duties of customs were not im-
posed until -October. But, leaving out
1901, there have to the end of June,
1933, been not “six small surpluses and
27 deficits” but 15 surpluses and 17 defi-
cits. Here is the list from the report of
McPhee’s speech, issued by the Govern-
ment Printer (Section 14, Table 1); shil-
lings and pence are omitted:

It will be seen that four of the 17
deficits have occurred during the years of
depression, when all the States have had
deficits. Actually, the four depression
deficits account for more than half
(£597,651) of the accumulated deficiency
(£1,150,900). And, as the same table
shows, the halcyon pre-Federation period
also had its accumulated deficiency.
There was a deficit (£11,824) in 1870, and
it was not wiped out till 1882. Then came
two more fairly good years, followed by
a debit balance in 1885. From that
twelvemonth until it entered the Com-
monwealth, Tasmania was always some-
thing to the bad. The aggregate defi-
ciency was £52,500 in 1900, and it went
up to £96,800 in 1901.
Special Commonwealth grants began
in the year which closed with a surplus
of £110,400, and for the first time for
29 years the accounts were in credit —
to the extent of £32,000. This was in-
creased to £35,200 by the operations for
the twelvemonth to June 30, 1914. Then
came the first war year, and naturally
the finances again took a turn for the
worse.
The Tasmanian Government is getting
a special grant of £330,000 this year (an
increase of £80,000) and demands a lot
more, as do the Governments at Adelaide
and Perth. Reviewing the claims of
these Governments, the Assistant-Secre-
tary of the Commonwealth Treasury
drily remarks that they have “a tendency
to overstate the effects of Federal ‘disa-
bilities,’ to disregard those of the depres-
sion, to assume no improvement in the
future, and to overlook the position of
the remaining States.” They also have
a tendency to blame the Commonwealth
for the follies of State Governments, and
to deny it any credit that may be due to
it; and Mr. Ogilvie goes all the way with
them, and further.
It is not the Commonwealth’s fault
that Tasmania is losing £260,000 a
year on its railways, or that it paid
6j p.c. for a public-works loan floated in
1921, or that, in Mr. McPhee’s words,
“[State] taxation has to be levied” to meet
“an unproductive interest charge of
£720,600,” or that “the average amount
returned to the applegrowers of Tas-
mania has dropped during the last three
years from ss. a bushel-case to Is. Bd. a
bushel-case”—as Senator Lawson said in
introducing the Fruitgrowers’ Relief Bill.
The Commonwealth has, in fact, con-
verted the 6} p.c. State loan into 34 p.c.
Australian stock ; it has voted £125,000 for
the applegrowers (the Tasmanians’ share
will be roughly one-half); it has waived
the clauses of the Navigation Act which
forbade overseas shipping cos. to carry
passengers from the mainland to Tas-
mania, and is subsidising other steamer
services to the Speck—in the case of a
concern placing a new steamer on the
Melbourne-Hobart run, the subsidy is to
be £50,000 a year for 10 years. But it
gets no appreciation from Mr. Ogilvie.
Tasmania has a case. Like its sister-
States, it is fairly entitled to such a re-
distribution of Commonwealth and State
functions as will admit of its paying its
way without asking for alms. Like their
fellow-Australians, the people of Tas-
mania have a right to be delivered from
the maddening competition that goes on
in the taxation and industrial-regulation
fields, and to have the proved defects of
the Constitution remedied. But these re-
forms could be achieved by negotiation
and by referendum. If they were really
in earnest, Mr. Collier and Mr. Ogilvie
might secure them; in any case, their
help would be valued. This would be
statesmanship on their part. But it would
not be “good politics.” So these two
Labor leaders prefer to play the gam:;
of the Tory provincialists who would
wreck the Union.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Restriction and Ruin.
If the Lyons Government is capable of
speaking firmly to anyone it should speak
firmly to the British Government on the
Major Elliot stunt. If it imagines that
Australia will meekly submit to restric-
tion of production to please Major Elliot
and the Russians and the Danes and the
Argentinos, it had better get the notion
out of its collective mind, presuming that
it has a collective mind. The country
press is up in arms. Farmers are
thoroughly uneasy. But Canberra goes
on discussing the matter as if it were
of small consequence, instead of being
a thing that imports ruin to many Aus-
tralians and Maorilanders, threatens the
finances and economic progress of their
nations and may profoundly affect their
relations with Britain.
London “Daily Telegraph,” usually re-
liable, publishes this:
The Government will assure the Dominions
that the refusal to sacrifice the foreigner is
due solely to the need of retaining Britain’s
export trade, and that this should in no
way be regarded as an act of unfriendliness
toward the Dominions.
Never was more specious nonsense
written. This is how Britain “sacrified
the foreigner” in the last two recorded
years. Its imports from Argentina were
valued at £50,885,000 sterling in 1932,
and £41,691,000 in 1933 ; from Denmark,
£40,569,600 in 1932, and £35,424,000 in
1933 ; from the U.S.A., £83,632,000 in
1932, and £75,790,000 in 1933. The
U.S.A.’s purchases of British goods were
valued at £15,091,300 in 1932, and
£19,052,000 in 1933 ; those of the
Argentinos, £10,660,386 and £13,082,000 ;
those, of the Danes, £9,852,000 and
£11,795,000. Even though the figures
quoted in the Commons last week—
£9,722,000 for nine months —show an
increase in the case of Denmark, the pre-
ponderance of advantage is still Over-
whelmingly on the side of Copenhagen.
Before the depression, Australia bought
British commodities worth nearly three
times as much as those purchased by
Denmark and the Argentine. Harsh
necessity has compelled it to reduce its
imports from Britain and all other coun-
tries, but to-day its purchases of British
goods are still considerably more than
those of any foreign country —they
amounted to £20,020,000 in 1932 and
£21,321,000 in 1933. Australia pays
£25,000,000-odd in interest every year in
London (it has been a severe strain to
keep up the payments), and for many
years it has given Britain the benefit of a
preferential tariff.
‘Britain refuses to sacrifice the
foreigner.” But Britons in high places
would evidently sacrifice Australians and
Maorilanders. Australia, for its part, will
accept no one-sided sacrifice. It is suffi-
ciently handicapped by its remoteness,
and by the pressure of a war debt from
which the Danes and the Argentinos are
free, and which the Russians repudiated.

Labor and Proputty.
Ten of Westralia’s 30 Legislative Coun-
cillors have to retire every third year, and
an election is due next Saturday. By
the irony of events, the Labor Govern-
ment has had to prepare for this election
while it was bringing in its Secession Bill,
and it has been obliged to hold up the
bill till the election is over.
Westralian Labor has never had a
majority in the Legislative Council, and
never will have. The property franchise
rules out most of the goldfields Labor-
ites and nearly all the shearers, shed-
hands, farm-laborers and timbermen.
But they all have votes for the Senate,
their womenfolk as well, and for 11
years—l9o6-1917—a1l the Westralian
Senators were Laborites.
At the general election of 1914, when
both Houses were dissolved, Labor went
very close to capturing the Senate alto-
gether. It returned the six Senators from
Westralia, six each from Victoria and
Queensland, five from South Australia
and four each from New South Wales
and 1 asmania, and it would assuredly
have sent six from South Australia if
Gregor McGregor had not died after
nomination day, which rendered it neces-
sary for the party to put an opponent
—J. W. Shannon—on its ticket,
On a population basis, Westralia is, of
course, greatly overrepresented in the
Senate. At times Labor has been stronger
in that House, relatively and actually, than
it has been in the Legislative Council. Yet
this comic Labor Government would de-
prive its people of rights which they have
enjoyed since 1901, in the process with-
drawing their representatives from a
Chamber in which they have exercised so
much power, and make them subservient
to u P ro P ert y Chamber for which two-
fifths of them have never had votes. This,
of course, it does not deliberately set out
to do —its attitude to secession is a mix-
ture of poltroonery and humbug—but
such would be the elfect. Well might
W. D. Johnson, the sole survivor of the
1901 Caucus, “deplore the position Labor
has got itself into with regard to this
Secession Bill,” and stigmatise it as
“unworthy of the party.”
♦ :
This “Loyalty.”
In pre-film days actresses used to get
their press-agents to stage bogus jewel
robberies and the like ; it was known as
publicity stuff. Then came Greta Garbo
and Hollywood ballyhoo. Now all over
Europe State departments exploit the
same kind of thing in the interests of
dictators and royalties, and call the
results “loyalty.” Mussolini, Hitler and
Stalin owe half their prestige with the
mentally-submerged to the intimate
stories disseminated about their exploits
in war and the sublime simplicity of
their private lives.
Britain has experts who direct every
royal movement of importance with
an eye to its effect on credulous
lieges. Long before Prince Henry
arrives here controllers of racecourses
and similar institutions will have re-
ceived written instructions as to what
to do to present him to the best
advantage. They will be told, for
example, to organise claques which can
be relied on to see that H.R.H. never
appears or leaves without hearty cheers.
This is all in the game ; it is easy to do
(it was officially estimated before the 1
Prince of Wales’s visit in 1920 that 30
hearty, united cheerers were capable of
making a crowd of 50,000 take up their
loyal cries inside five or six minutes),
and no reasonable person can object to
it. The tribute dishonors neither those
who give nor him who takes it.
But what possible justification can there
be for the flood of drivel which Sydney
“Sun,” amongst other dailies, turned on
the moment it was disclosed that Prince
Henry was coming instead of his brother?
' Essentially a man of action, yet gentle
as a woman, the Prince is fond of pictures,
music and flowers.
He is passionately fond of dogs He
has trained one to bring him a paper in the
mornings.
Like Foch and Joffre, he loves flowers;
and, also like Joffre and Foch, he is a
soldier.
Other aspects of the Prince’s character
recall Chaucer’s “very perfect, gentle
knight.” He once saw an old lady
struggling with a suitcase, and asked if he
might carry it for her.
Here is a self-respecting soldier who is
no longer young, and who has been dodg-
ing the limelight which beats upon society
half-wits all his professional life. The
whole of his training has been designed
to inculcate a respect for direct speech
and a contempt for vulgar sentimentalism
and melodrama. And the first thing Aus-
tralia does through a section of its press
—Australia, which Englishmen of his pro-
fession associate with storm troops—is to
empty over him a bucket of journalistic
slops that would sicken many a male
talkie actor!
If our flapper papers won’t drop the
degrading business out of respect for the
intelligent men and women of the Com-
monwealth they should do it out of con-
sideration for our prospective visitor.
A first rule of hospitality is: “Don’t
make a fool of the guest.”
The Effulgence of Trautwein.
Trautwein, M.L.C., whose “fruit-
machine” manoeuvres so interested a
Royal Commissioner —a Judge of the
N.S.W. Supreme Court —is sporting a
trinket in celebration of his rise to great-
ness. Taking his Legislative Council pass,
which has doubled in value by pre-depres-
sion standards as the result of the rise in
the price of gold, he has added to it
about £9OO worth of diamonds, one of
which is 9\ carats in weight. So when
Mr. Trautwein rises he also shines. Even
if the Railway Department will not re-
cognise his bauble because he has de-
faced it, he will at least have the consola-
tion of introducing a little sparkle into
the proceedings of Macquarie-street by
entirely novel means.
It might occur to unreasonable people,
of course, that if Mr. Trautwein does
not intend to use his pass he should
hand it back to the Government so that
it might be melted down. The proceeds
could be used to buy milk for under-
nourished babies. And arithmeticians
might calculate, without effort, that £9OO
would buy more than a thousand pairs of
sound boots, 18,000 hot meals, 450 reason-
ably decent sets of working clothes or
enough milk to feed legions of children
for a week. But they would certainly be
unjust in doing it. Mr. Trautwein, it is
said, was chosen as a better man than,
say, John Peden mainly by votes handed
to him by a party whose cry is “men
before money.” When members of that
party approve a rich capitalist, owner
°f hotels and racehorses and. merchant
of “fruit machines,” they must think him
a very good capitalist indeed, and their
approval must be regarded as a license
to him to hang diamonds all over him-
self if he likes, though it may be a little
hard to get unemployed to see his sup-
porters’ viewpoint.
Anyway, this decoration or elaboration
of badges is not a bad idea. There should
be a movement to see that they are made
brighter and more attractive. Some
members —like the ones who elected Mr.
Trautwein—are recommended to give
their insignia a good polish with ashes
and to retain them by keeping their gauds
well wrapped in sackcloth. Both
materials are cheap and highly suitable
in the circumstances.

Rifle Clubs and Defence.
As in most other items, apart from the
maintenance of a large civilian staff, the
Defence Department is niggardly and
shortsighted in dealing with rifle clubs.
In the event of invasion, Senator Pearce
and his friends would go down on their
knees and thank Providence for a couple
of hundred thousand trained riflemen ;
but most of the youngsters now grow-
ing up scarcely know a stock from a
barrel, and get little chance to improve
their knowledge. Parliament provided
only £22,644 for rifle clubs last year.
Accordingly,
Approval was given by the Minister for
the continuance during 1932-33 of the
suspension of the formation of new rifle
clubs and of the construction of new rifle
ranges.
The same suspension had been in opera-
tion in 1931-32, despite “the receipt of
an appreciable number of applications
for the formation of new clubs, particu-
larly from regions remote from facilities
for full military training.” A little more
money is to be made available this year.
However, some progress has been
made in spite of the poverty of the rifle
associations. The old long Mark VI rifle
is being replaced with the short, heavy-
barrelled Mark VII weapon so that the
clubs will be armed uniformly with the
military forces, except that riflemen
will be permitted to use approved aper-
ture sights and a fore sight slightly thicker
than that of the M.F. guns. The dimen-
sions of aiming marks on targets, too,
have been altered —on the 4ft. target the
bull’s-eye is now 9in. in diameter instead
of Bin. as formerly, and an inner is 3in.
broader at 300 yards. On the 6ft. board
the bull’s-eye has been reduced from
20in. to 18in.
There are now 1605 rifle clubs in the
Commonwealth, with 39,066 efficient
members, so that the number of clubs
has dwindled by 15 during the year and
the number of effective members by 900.
It should not be too much to ask
Senator Pearce to open one eye wide
enough to see the necessity of money
and organisation for the development of
capable shots. If the present grant were
trebled, it would be equal only to the
amount which the Commonwealth spends
annually on the League of Nations ; and
with a treble grant it should be possible
to double the number of trainees, and
perhaps institute a few miniature ranges,
which are badly needed in the suburbs
of Australian cities.

A Lesson in Injustice.
By nine votes to eight the new Parlia-
ment of the New Guinea Mandate has
rejected a portentous ordinance which
shows how far the Commonwealth
bureaucracy still has to go to practise
the real technique of injustice. New
Guinea has a few motor-cars —its imports
are about 30 a year, or a little more —
and it has a large and rather helpless
pedestrian population. Among the whites
more alcohol is drunk per head than in
the Commonwealth —tropical water is
bad ; among the natives, Providence dis-
tributed a job lot of heads which are
generally carried drooping like wet lilies,
and which hold brains more intent on
betel-nut than the traffic.
The Rabaul colored gentleman particu-
larly loves to sit in the middle of the
road and discuss his loves and the price
of tumbak. If he happens to ride a
bicycle he behaves as if he were practis-
ing for a race in the Hampton Court
maze. If a car comes along, his first
impulse is to step in front of it until he
feels the wind of its progress ; then he
gets out of the way in the manner best
calculated to scrape the paint off the
mudguard without injuring himself.
The Rabaul Council’s proposed ordi-
nance was designed to protect him when
he failed to jump far enough, and also
his dog and his pig and his offspring,
who love to go to sleep on a warm mac-
adam cone. From its enactment third-
party insurance by car-owners was to be
compulsory, but “every person, other
than the owner, who is in charge of a
motor vehicle, whether with the author-
ity of the owner or not,” was “deemed
as the owner’s agent in respect of the
owner’s liability to pay damage.”
But even this did not satisfy, for the
Crown Law authorities proposed as well
the following:
19f. In an action for damages on the
ground of negligence proof that the
death of or bodily injury to a pedestrian
was caused by or arose out of the use of a
motor vehicle shall be prima facie evidence
of negligence on the part of the person in
charge or control of the motor vehicle.
Mr. Hogan, the Crown Law officer who
put it forward in the Council, was sur-
prised at the defeat of the bill. In his
opinion, “without the last provision, the
bill only touched on the fringe of the
question.” The Federal Government will
need to watch the proceedings of the new
Council closely. Otherwise, it may wake
up one day and find that Rabaul has
established the principle that, if a burglar
drops his loot over the verandah rail
and accidentally kills a Chinaman, the
circumstances shall be prima facie evi-
dence of negligence, as a result of which
the rightful owner of the stolen articles
may be found guilty of manslaughter.

Australians as Linguists.
“El V.”: Somebody has been spreading
himself in “S. M. Herald” on the alleged
poor capacity of Australians for learning
languages. He says that “Englishmen are
considered notoriously bad linguists,” but
we are worse —largely because we can’t
even speak our own language. Hence,
examination results show a dispropor-
tionate number of failures in languages.
If Australians are bad linguists it is
only because of their lack of opportunity
to learn languages early through contact
with foreigners and because of the bad-
ness of our teaching methods. I have
found it easy, with proper opportunities,
to get a working knowledge of various
foreign tongues, but I defy anybody to
even interest me in a foreign tongue,
much less teach it to me, by the average
school method.
I spent six years learning German at
school and won two scholarships, largely
on the strength of my knowledge of it
and of Latin and Greek. But in the end
1 did not know enough of the classical
tongues to appreciate the beauties of
Horace, and if the last Kaiser himself
had begged me on his bended knees to
say a dozen sentences in his native lingo
on any ordinary topic I could not have
obliged him.
Probably the best linguists in the world
are the Russian and Bulgarians. In
Sofia, everybody seems able to chatter
in half a dozen tongues —they are taught
as soon as they can speak. In Constan-
tinople, most youngsters of English
parentage learn English, Turkish (which,
though a very regular and expressive
tongue, is far from easy) and French,
and speak the three like natives. In
that cosmopolitan spot, where a man
needs to be a champion to be anywhere
near the top of Babel, the palm a few
years ago was given to an Australian,
Leeper.
In China an Australian, Morrison, was
even more famous. In Japan, one of the
best standard dictionaries was the work
of an Englishman, Brinkley. But Brink-
ley and Morrison did not learn their
languages Australian fashion. Had they
done so they would still be accumulating
radicals in Heaven. I’d love to see an
Australian teacher imparting Cantonese
—which any old nigger in the Pacific can
pick up in a few months —by the gram-
mar-and-copybook method.
Language-teaching in the Common-
wealth needs a thorough overhaul. All
the stiff grammatical drudgery and trans-
lation (which actually hinders rather than
helps) should be cut out, to begin with,
and the education departments should
introduce the Berlitz or some other sys-
tem in which the tongue to be taught
is used by the pupil from the beginning.
A knowledge of grammar may be left
till the neophyte can read it in the lan-
guage itself. By this method any intelli-
gent youngster should be fairly fluent
in French or German in a couple of
years, and able to read the classical litera-
ture in those languages in three or four
years—provided he has practice every
day, which is an essential. And the
motto “Catch ’em young” should be
hung up in every kindergarten.

"AND ITS PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Cauboy”: A quaint procession
wended its way through Melbourne’s
streets during Wool Week. It comprised
various tableaux, including a young man
with a bishop’s mitre on his head who
represented St. Blaize. St. Blaize is
Edmund Jowett’s proposed patron of
Australian wool. The saint’s claims to
the position rest on the fact or rumor
that he removed a fishbone from the

D.E. . A wandering gentleman who
was among those present when the
Australian cricketers arrived at Waterloo
station astonished the people of his city
by getting a knighthood, and embarrassed
its newspapers by remarrying after a
divorce. Both his partners have to be
mentioned occasionally, and it sorely
puzzled social editors how to label them.
After deep thought they decided that each
was entitled to the prefix “Lady.” Of
course, neither is, nor is any other
knight’s wife in Australia. “Dame,”
perhaps ; but “Lady”—no.

“Schnorrer”: The flowers which well-
meaning citizens sent to the funeral of
Rabbi Cohen must have been an em-
barrassment to those in charge, for
flowers have no place in a Jewish funeral.
Such a ceremony is by tradition shorn
of all frills —even the coffin is supposed
to be of plain wood without adornment.
Some of the extremely orthodox must
have been shocked at the departure from
Judaic convention ; but apparently it was
thought far better to violate a minor
usage than to hurt the feelings of many
Gentile sympathisers who wished, to pay
a tribute to the dead.
“Cine Ma”: One of the most dis-
tressing effects of the movies I have not
seen stressed. Motion-picture fans have
long since discovered that you cannot
make an effective demonstration against
a bore on the screen. When they pay
a rare visit to a flesh-and-blood show
they carry this feeling of impotence with
them. The result is, as far as my experi-
ence in Melbourne has gone, that dis-
plays of audience-antagonism have
ceased. It is 20 years since a house
loudly declared at the Princess that an
amateur show at professional prices was
unmitigated tripe, and it is seven or eight
years since a Tivoli crowd emptied its
pennies at the feet of Little Tich, under
the mistaken impression that that dwarf
comedian was copying other people’s
stuff—actually, he was repeating his ori-
ginal turns which had been pinched by
local farceurs. Some day the talkies will
make their patrons so inert that Lang
will be able to address an audience of
people with deposits in the ’Wales and
the ’Asia on the “nationalisation” of
banking and elicit merely polite applause.

select a dinner for him. The dinner was

“Glencorse”: If “Gunner” (B. 4/4/’34)
had been up at Plugstreet Wood in
March, 1918, he might have seen four
Fritz ’planes brought down by Archies
in one week. I can recall an
even stranger experience, that of see-
ing a Fritz ’plane surrounded in
mid-air. It was an exciting scrap, which
was terminated by the German pilot
waving a large piece of white cloth
and gliding down to earth, closely
followed by our own ’planes. This
occurred between Neuve Eglise and
Messines.
“L. 1.8.”: All these yarns about anti-
aircraft guns move me to ask whether
any of the yarners ever had to compete
with enemy aircraft without Archies.
Writer’s first introduction to a flying
enemy was at the Romani base, in the
Sinai desert, some weeks before the big
scrap there. The bomber went after our
horses effectively, killing some 20-odd
in one regiment and stampeding most
of the others in the brigade all over the
desert. We hadn’t even a Lewis gun
mounted on a post as an “anti”; the
only reply was by rifle fire and one or
two L.G. heroes, who lay on their backs
and tried to hold the heavy contraption
up long enough for a burst. Then the
Sikh Mountain Battery hove in sight.
The ’plane was still circling round, and
the battery commander conceived the
bright idea of running a gun up a steep
sandhill until its muzzle was well in the
air. When the ’plane crossed his field
of fire he let fly with one round of shrap-
nel. The shell burst in the air well away
from the Taube, but the gun and its
crew were all mixed in confusion at the
foot of the sandhill, the recoil having
made the little contraption turn a somer-
sault. Fortunately the sand.was soft.

“Adelaide”: As an odd detail, under-
takers claim to have been represented in
the Adelaide City Council ever since 1874
—till now, the fourth and last having
retired at the last election. One of them
had about 35 years of it as councillor
and alderman, and was only removed by
his scythe-bearing business colleague.

“Lord Luvus”: The Government of
Victoria is in a sad quandary. It wants td
do the Prince proud, so it asked the
Defence Department to recondition the
two old State carriages in its possession.
With postillions, horses and livery com-
plete, the Commonwealth Government’s
price was £3OOO. This was reduced when
it transpired that the requirements had
been overstated somehow. But Victoria
has an £BOO,OOO deficit; so the Duke will
have to be carried through the streets in
a motor-can A motor-car has the same
effect on the dignity of a royal proces-
sion as it has on a funeral. Travelling
too slow has a bad effect on the engine,
and travelling too fast is disastrous to
the impressiveness of the procession. It
doesn’t look right for a motor vehicle
which is capable of 60 miles per hour to
amble along at 10m.p.h., but it looks quite
natural for a squad of handsome horses to
do so. There is a solution to the problem,
however, which might have occurred to
the authorities if they were not so hide-
bound by tradition. Let them mount the
Duke on horseback. He has a fine
figure, is an excellent horseman, we have
some magnificent chargers and the cost
would be negligible. Thus would the
Ministry kill two birds with one stone.

And never more so than in shorts,
In fine,
She’s beauty incarnate in shorts.
She’s hard, you may bet, to get past at the
net,
At whizzing ripostes She’s a peach,
And she sparkles and shines at those balls on
the lines
You’d hardly have dreamed she could reach.
She’s a Dian, no less, in any old dress
By wholly authentic reports;
Let her wear what she will and she’ll give you a
thrill,
But her piece de resistance is shorts.
Too right!
Her suit, that is strongest is shorts.
In her forehand and back there’s a punch
and a smack
That has landed her many a prize;
She carries the stamp of the feminine champ.
Not only in masculine eyes.
She has strokes by the score that spectators
adore
And gambits of numerous sorts,
But she’s never, you ken, so striking as when
She’s trimly apparelled in shorts,
Our oath!
They reckon her scrumptious in shorts.

PRIZES FOR PARS.
All contributions fco this page
and all the other pages containing
reading matter are paid for. As
additional encouragement, a selected
“Bulletin” drawing will, until further
notice, be sent with his cheque to
the author of the raciest Society
par. received in any week. Writers
of “Aboriginalities,” of gags for
joke-blocks and of “Hints for the
Farm” will share in the distribution
of drawings, of which at least four
will be posted every week.


“Awbeca”: Anzac Day “incidents” (B.
2/5/’34)? At Killarney (Q.) half an
hour after the ceremony all the wreaths
had been removed from the monument.
But not by anti-war propagandists—cows
had dined sumptuously on the wreaths
while they were left unguarded.
* * * *
“Mudurup”: Occasionally divorced
persons are reunited in holy matrimony,
but a recent Perth case, in which a
woman sued her former husband for
breach of promise to remarry, must be
the first of its kind in Australia, if not
in the Empire. The Judge said the cir-
cumstances were remarkable, and they
certainly were. Six years ago the lady
secured her freedom from the conjugal
tie. A year or two ago she was sentenced
to a term of imprisonment, and the de-
fendant wrote to her in gaol a letter
which she construed as an offer of re-
marriage. But his Honor found that
there was no definite offer, that even if
there were an indefinite one it was not
accepted within a reasonable time, and he
“Please, Mrs. Whaite, will you come up to the bathroom at once? I cant make
out whether Mr. Whaite is scalding to death or singing”
also viewed as “a critical circumstance”
that the lady showed no anxiety to re-
acquire her husband till he had been en-
riched by a legacy. Furthermore, he
remarked that any damage suffered, even
if the offer had been made, would be
infinitesimal. Verdict for defendant.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: Attention was directed the
other day to the watch kept on Govern-
ment lottery drawings by the report
of a case in which an official assignee
stepped in and seized a third prize won
by a bankrupt. Debt-collecting agencies
are as vigilant, and the police sometimes
get useful information therefrom. There
is a case on record of a man collecting
three years’ imprisonment as well as a
few hundred pounds as a result of hav-
ing a share in a winning number. He
had escaped from his bail while an
appeal was pending, and the police had
no knowledge of his whereabouts until
the unguarded use of his own name in a
lottery syndicate put him away.
* * * *
“Jills Two”: How’s this for red-tape?
During the last heat-wave at Broken Hill
my water-meter stuck up and cut off the
water. I was about to telephone to the
P.W.D. when one of its plumbers
drove up to the house next door to
change the meter. Noticing that he had
two spare meters in his dray, I asked
him if he would change mine when
he had finished the other job. He was
sorry, but he could do nothing with-
out express directions from “the office.”
I telephoned the office, explained the
position and offered to bring the plumber
to the ’phone for instructions. The
voice at the other end was sorry, but
that would be against the regulations.
Still I needn’t worry ; “we’ll send a man
out to change your meter immediately.”
Half an hour later a second plumber
arrived, just in time to see his mate drive
away from next door.
* * * *
“Caballer”: In a reference to stolen
pictures “The Dip” tells us (B. 25/4/’34)
that an Italian workman “lifted the
‘Mona Lisa’ from the walls of the
Louvre, took it from its frame, hid it
under his blouse and coolly walked off
with it.” Actually the “Mona Lisa” is
painted on wood, and nobody could wear
a blouse big enough to cover and con-
ceal that picture unless he were several
sizes larger than Camera. A recent
Hollywood production showed a thief
rolling up this same picture as if it had
been painted on canvas, but, of course,
that sort of thing never troubles film
fans.
* * * *
“H.A.L.”: In almost every Cornish
community the custom persists of cele-
brating June 24, which corresponds with
the summer solstice in the Northern
Hemisphere. Bonfires are lighted and
fireworks are let off after the fashion of
November 5, the tradition being rigidly
observed in such strongholds of the
Cousin Jack as Wallaroo and Moonta.
Ethnologists have traced many things
about the CJ. to the influence of the
Phoenicians who used to visit Cornwall
to barter for tin, the “billygoat” beard
being one example, but the origin of
this bonfire custom is a puzzle to scien-
tists. It is no use asking old Granfer
Trepolpen why it is done, for he can
only reply, “Always do un at home,
boay.” It may be a survival of some
Druidical rite.
* * * *
“Wagga”: A friend of mine found
himself low in petrol in running through
a Victorian town. It was about 2 a.m.,
“Somebody really ought to tell that Skunk girl why she is never asked to
parties."
and there was nothing doing at any fill-
ing station. Failing to rouse anyone, he
appealed to a policeman who happened
along. “Stiff luck!” said the officer;
“all the bowser people live at their homes.
But if a gallon or so will be any help
just run your ’bus along the street and
drain all the bowser pipes—there’s always
something left in them.” He did so, and
collected just enough to see him to Mel-
bourne.
* * * *
“St. James”: A Sydney newspaper
'made a shocking bloomer when it
supplemented a cable covering some of
Mr. Dillinger’s activities with the in-
formation that “National Guardsmen
from West Point have been added
to the regular prison guards.” The
American National Guardsman is just
about equivalent in popular esti-
mation to the British militiaman
of 30 years ago, when the mili-
tia was mostly regarded as a
back door to the army for thick-
headed youngsters unable to
enter Sandhurst. West Point is
the training school for regular
officers. To bracket these god-
like individuals with the National
Guard is akin to confusing a
badly - reported -on Territorial
regiment with a crack battalion
of H.M. Foot Guards.
* V * *
“M. de Paris”: A vulgar error
which always mildly irritates me
was repeated in the N.S.W. In-
dustrial Court recently when a
member of the Bar reminded
the Bench that an Act “provid-
ing for hanging, drawing and
quartering was still in force.”
The popular impression of
“drawing, hanging and quarter-
ing,” to put the component parts
of the sentence in their proper
order, is that “drawing” relates
to a similar process to that to
which fowls are subjected before
being cooked. Nothing is
further from the fact. “Draw-
ing” simply meant that the condemned
man was ignominiously “drawn” to the
scaffold by a horse attached to a hurdle,
which was dragged over the cobblestones.
It had nothing to do with the disem-
bowelment after partial hanging which
was also part of the sentence for high
treason.
* * . =? *
“Pawang”: Conan Doyle, like Sir
Oliver Lodge, was a distinguished man.
Doyle wrote fine novels. Lodge invented
a lightning guard and other devices
which immensely benefited submarine
telegraphy, and his researches in pure
science were of importance. Both took
to spiritualism in their later years and
established new reputations for them-
selves, amongst a new circle. It didn’t do
them any harm, apparently. There is
another side to the picture, however.
Influenced directly or indirectly by the
writings of these two savants, Mrs.
Martha Lees Turner, aged 35, of Too-
ronga-road, Glen Iris, Melbourne (a some-
what drab suburb), began to take interest
in the astral sphere six years ago. She
started to attend seances. Presently
she commenced to receive messages from
beyond the grave, voices spoke to her
and strange ghostly presences began to
follow her about. Whereas the spirit
world was a friendly place for Lodge
and Doyle, to Mrs. Turner it was peopled
with malevolent spooks akin to the most
horrible creations of the Malay witch-
doctor. A few days ago Mr. Turner came
home to find May Turner, aged 10, and
Elizabeth Turner, aged 8, with their skulls
battered in. He found Mrs. Turner with
her throat and wrists gashed with a razor,
and she died subsequently in hospital.
The medical diagnosis was neurasthenia
and high blood pressure. One man’s
meat is very often another individual’s
poison.

“Oxmead”: An exchange of letters
between Douglas Sladen and the Sydney
University Senate has been referred to in
“S. M. Herald.” The biographer of Adam
Lindsay Gordon, it seems, wrote to the
Senate to ask whether it would confer an
honorary degree on him, and was in-
formed that it had no such power, which
is, presumably, the equivalent of a polite
refusal. The Senate is also reported as
having informed the applicant that its
Chair of Modern History was established
in 1891, and that the first professor was
the late Arnold Wood. This seems so
irrelevant that one is curious as to what
academic post Sladen actually filled in
Sydney Uni. over half a century ago.
“Who’s Who” credits him with having
been “the first to hold the Chair of His-
tory in the University of Sydney,” and
another reference-book mentions that he
is an LL.B. of Melbourne. On the face
of it the conclusion seems unavoidable
that the Sydney Uni. Senate denies him
the former distinction. What was he
then —just a temporary lecturer?
“Marsh”: “L. 1.8.” (B. 18/4/’34) is
wrong when he says that, during the few
instances where Light Horsemen had to
occupy trenches in the Sinai-Palestine
campaign, the mounts were too far back
to give anyone a chance to mount in
hot haste. At Duiedar, early in the piece,
we occupied trenches in the redoubts
surrounding the oasis, and our prads
were not 100 yards away. Later, outside
Jaffa, we sniped at the Turks from
trenches on the ridge of a hill with the
Walers not 20 yards away ; again, when
kept busy with “chats” in the trenches
along the Jordan Valley foothills, we
were close enough to the horse lines to
read the brands on the prads.
* * * *
“Findy”: Landlubbers? My father
when a lad was keenly interested in sail-
ing-ships, and, those being the days of
the clippers, he was familiar with
all the regular callers at Port Adelaide.
One day he took a cousin from the bush,
a boy of his own age, down to the
wharves. There lay the Torrens, the daddy
of them all. Like a proud showman, he
pointed out all the fine points of the
vessel—her beautiful lines, her lofty
masts, her maze of rigging and her snow-
white decks. Imagine his feelings when
the cousin, wishing to show some polite
interest, inquired, “And which is the
front of the ship?”
A POINTER.
[FOR THE BULETIN.]
“The marriage rate for April in N.S.W. was the
highest since December, 1929.”
Depression’s clouds, we hear it ev’ry day
By Lyons or by Stevens certified,
Are gradually vanishing away—
And hear it just as stolidly denied
By politicians on the other side.
Yet here’s at least one wholly heartening sign.
In Hymen’s bonds folks are again being tied
As regularly as in Twenty-Nine.
Cold figures cannot lie, some people say;
Others the aged apothegm deride,
Asserting vehemently that they may
And do —it all depends how they’re applied.
For me, I’m not attempting to decide,
But if from wedding-rings you take a line
And find in rising altar-dates a guide
We’re pretty nearly back to Twenty-Nine.
“Where are the songs of spring? Ay, where
are they?”
A poet asked one mellow autumntide
When fields were stubble and when skies were
grey.
And spring is still the season specified
By poets as the time when banns are cried
And you and she are labelled hers and thine;
But here comes autumn with as many a bride
As glowing summer showed in Twenty-Nine.
April has gone, and now it’s up to May
To show it’s been arrested, the decline
In lives together linked for ever and aye,
To let the rice and the confetti spray
As in the brave old days of Twenty-Nine.

POLITICAL POINTS
The Bulletin was premature in an-
nouncing that Westralian Labor s Seces-
sion Bill had been passed. It is certain
to go through, but the Government has
to await the pleasure of the Leg. Council,
one-third of which is about to face the
electors. Labor has a whole seven mem-
bers in the Chamber with the restricted
franchise, whose powers would be greatly
increased under “the new Dominion,
and hopes to come back with at least
two more.
Norbert Keenan, who leads the Nat.
remnant in Westralian Assembly, made a
rousing speech in support of the Seces-
sion Bill, and doubtless went home well
pleased with himself. He couldn’t have
been so self-complacent when he read
what Kalgoorlie’s Municipal Council had
resolved while he was orating :
That if secession is granted, the goldfields
area, including the port of Esperance,
should be allowed to remain within the
Federation.
The goldfields are fast regaining their
old importance, and secesh without them
would be a sorry affair. Keenan was
himself Mayor of Kalgoorlie, and its
M.L.A. later; but he was a Federalist
then.
London expects that Russia will apply
to join the League of Nations at the next
session of the Assembly in September.
One wonders what Lenin would think
about it —his ideal was that the consti-
tuents of the League of Nations should
join Russia in a Moscow-dominated
world brotherhood achieved through the
dictatorship of the proletariat. Since
Lenin’s day Russian communism has
grown so much like State capitalism that
Trotsky is surreptitiously campaigning
for a new revolution.
The Commonwealth Cabinet is sit-
ting in Adelaide this week for the first
time in history. The Prime Minister is
remaining a whole day. It was intended
that he should sojourn for four days and
then visit the Barker electorate, but pos-
sibly he has heard that the member for
Barker is a descendant of Black Lochiel.
The Camerons were always dour exacters
of awkward promises, and, though the
modern Australian types of them cannot
nail those who evade their wishes to the
tavern floor, their ancestors’ dirks have
been replaced by votes, which can be used
just as effectively against a politician.
The Vic. Government has had its holes
in the ground at Wonthaggi overhauled
by a Maoriland mining engineer. He
reports that “the coalfield is seriously
disturbed by faults, which vary in down-
throw from a few feet to 700 feet and
more.” It seems to be more seriously
disturbed by the habit of down-throwing
tools. “From March 30 to the beginning
of the present strike” this has cost the Gov-
ernment £24,600 and the men £BO,OOO ;
and “the present strike’] looks like last-
ing till the next depression.
The rearrangement of the Greater Bris-
bane wards worked out as well for the
Labor party as Theodore’s famous
Assembly redistribution, which enabled
his crowd to win a stunning majority of
seats with a minority of votes. Adding
the Communist’s 8262 to the Labor poll
for the Lord Mayoralty, 79,367, J. W.
Greene finished 11,105 down. Thus the
voting was roughly 8 to 7 in Labor’s
favor. Yet the wards elected 14 Labor
aldermen (excluding the Lord Mayor)
and only six opponents. Another Assem-
bly redistribution, based, as far as Bris-
bane is concerned, on this strikingly
successful municipal experiment, is now
talked of, but prospective candidates pro-
test that it ought to go farther. Some
people are never satisfied.
Lang trotted out the familiar no-con-
fidence motion last week, and nearly
exhausted his energy and his voice in
strafing the Government; but he had
enough left for a complaint about hav-
ing to sit beyond the dinner hour. It is
really the public which has the right to
growl. It is a disgrace that the House
which Jack adorns cannot get through
its business without wasting hours in
futile wrangling. If Lang cut out silly
no-confidence motions, and other mem-
bers on both sides decided to grow up
and stop their childish nonsense in de-
bate, they would be able to get home for
dinner most evenings in the week.
Scullin dives into history to confute
Lang:—
When Mr. Lang was unable to pay his
public servants he came to me for help.
I said “How can you expect to borrow
if your policy is not to pay interest?” He
replied “I will pay interest” ; and he
abandoned the Lang Plan.
Was the mendicant grateful? He was
not. Poor little Radio Jim got him the
money through the Loan Council, and
“three months later his representatives in
the Federal Parliament stabbed my Gov-
ernment in the back.”
"Aren’t I to have a bit of melon, Dad?”
“Yes, son. If this gentleman doesn’t need it, you can have the skin."
Melbourne, like Sydney, has acquired
a Milk Board (though not in circum-
stances warranting inquiry into mysteri-
ous payments beforehand and cryptic
talk of presents afterwards), and in the
board’s first ukase, as in Sydney, the
wholesale price was raised —to lOd. a
gallon at country factories and lid. de-
livered in Melbourne. And, also as in
Sydney, consumers are to pay a lot more
than the increase to the farmers. Con-
sidering the ample supplies at their doors,
milk ought to be cheaper in Sydney and
Melbourne than almost anywhere else in
the world, instead of being dearer than
almost anywhere else.
Constitutional and financial rearrange-
ments being too big a job for the Lyons
Government, a Royal Commission is try-
ing to find out how much more Com-
monwealth money will keep the dissatis-
fied State Governments quiet. As is the
case with some Arbitration Judges, the
chairman of the Commission is rather
fond of airing his own views, which may
be interesting but are not pertinent. The
financial agreement being mentioned, the
chairman said that the States made a
sacrifice in accepting it; “they sold their
birthright for a mess of something.” That
is only the gentleman’s opinion. It should
be enough that the agreement was sub-
mitted to the people of Australia, and
that the people of Australia approved of
it by 2,237,391 to 773,852.
There has been an odd sequel to the
inquiry into the administration of the
Yanco Farm Home, which was con-
demned root and branch by the investi-
gating magistrate. The super, was “re-
gressed” without loss of salary and trans-
ferred to the post of inspector in the
Child Welfare Department. “He is now
under me,” said the chief inspector to a
commission which is probing the general
administration of that department—“and
he’s getting £2O a year more than I am.”
Sydney tram conductors continue to
be maimed and killed on the footboards
which jut out from the Government’s
archaic caravans. Two cases reached the
Coroner’s Court the other day ; in one,
the victim was struck by the shaft of
a lorry, and in the other by a ’bus. There
would be no objection from any quarter
if the Government scrapped every tram
on which men have to risk their lives in
narrow streets every time they collect
fares; besides being dangerous to em-
ployees, these vehicles are desperately un-
comfortable to passengers. Stevens and
cO. have started on the job, but are not
doing it quickly enough.
The new “harmony policy” enunciated
by the Japanese Foreign Minister amounts
to a Monroe Doctrine for Further Asia ;
but it is different from Washington’s
Monroe Doctrine, in kind as well as in
degree. The Americans merely warn off
Powers with ambitions to acquire Ameri-
can territory. Mr. Hirota’s policy of
harmony can only be effected by the
military subjugation of the Celestial land.
This is a tall order, and would involve
war with Russia and possibly other
Powers. In fact, there will be a lot of
discord before Mr. Hirota gets his
Asiatic orchestra playing the same tune.
There is a lesson for pacifists in the
woes of Yahia Muhammed, Imam of
Yemen. Yahia fell foul of The Wahabi,
Ibn Saud, who is titular “king” of Saudi
Arabia to the north. This saint launched
his troops against the other holy man, and
the latter has fled from his capital with
his following. Before leaving he sent a
message to say he refused to consider
himself at war and had merely with-
drawn to a safe distance until The
Wahabi should “return to an attitude of
justice and wisdom.” Meanwhile, the
invaders are looting Yemen right and
left, and leaving little but the fleas.
It is a lean week in politics which does
not provide an example of the everlast-
ing conflict between State and Common-
wealth powers. The Act under which
licensing of butter manufacturers was
demanded in Queensland was declared
invalid by the High Court, but argument
still continues in Brisbane about its “modi-
fications.” The amount annually spent
in litigation on constitutional points
would pay for a referendum at which the
people might declare for a complete and
final separation of powers.
A Melbourne man with British con-
nections drew £5671 during the year to
June 30, 1931, as interest on U.K. funded
stock. Though he left the money in Bri-
tain, it is taxable in Australia, under a
Scullin-Theodore law, at the rate of 9s.
6d. in the £. The Federal Commissioner
claimed an additional 9s. 6d. in the £
on £1097 for exchange. The C.J. and
Justices Evatt and McTiernan said he
was right; Justices Rich, Starke and
Dixon, that he was wrong. Verdict for
the Commissioner, with costs, the C.J.
(who is 82) having a casting vote, as it
were. It may be good law, but, from the
viewpoint of a country which could do
with lots of moneyed tourists and
sojourners, it is dashed bad policy.
Before the Easter meetings the A.J.C.
committee excluded one Rufus Naylor, a
person interested in racehorses and a
punter in a big way, from Randwick
racecourse under a rule which apparently
empowered it to deal with “any person
who at any inquiry held by committee
or stewards gives any evidence mis-
leading in any particular.” Naylor ap-
plied for a Supreme Court injunction.
Long Innes, J., said,
Naylor admitted in the witness box that
he deliberately and consistently gave false
and intentionally misleading evidence when-
ever he conceived that it might be to his
detriment to tell the truth.
His Honor nevertheless held that the
committee had exceeded its statutory
powers. The judgment may be inter-
preted to mean that no sporting or show
body can bar out any paying member
of the public whose presence is held to
be undesirable. If so, it is a case for
immediate action by Parliament, now in
session.
The Hands-off-China policy is of re-
spectable antiquity. It was once the
settled policy of the Manchu emperors;
they fought and lost several wars
with the English and one with the French
to maintain it. The Taiping and Boxer
rebellions were attempts to preserve it.
The present Chinese Government has
reversed the policy, and now favors large
European and American loans, to be
used in building munitions factories and
raising armies to combat the Red menace.
The Japanese Army has now taken offi-
cial charge of the policy. Leopards will
change their spots and disarmament con-
ferences result in disarmament before the
other Powers submit to it.

The retirement of George Todd, after
35 years in the chair of the “World’s
News,” removed Sydney’s record-reign
editor. He started what proved a little
goldmine to the old “D.T.” company. He
then sub-edited the “D.T.” for a while,
but neither he nor the “World’s News”
liked the arrangement, and he soon re-
turned to his original job. He is settling
in Sussex (Eng.), where a son practises as
a doctor.
“Cantab”: Lord Cromer, who suc-
ceeds Lord Hailsham as president of the
M. was no cricketer at Eton, and
he only joined the great St. John’s Wood
club a few years ago. He is a son of
the man who got an earldom for straight-
ening out the finances of Egypt, and is
himself a noted financier. He was
managing director of Baring Bros, when
the war began. He has been a director
of the Suez Canal since 1926, was
assistant-private secretary to the King
for a time, and is much liked by the
roy.al family. The last is probably one
of the chief reasons why he has achieved
the blue ribbon of the crease.
Nobody would take A. W. Green,
now on his way to see the Tests, for 76.
He retired from the directorship of Child
Welfare in N.S.W. ten years ago. Parkes
chose him for his known affection for
kids: he was a voluntary master in a
ragged school at the age of 16. Since his
retirement he has concentrated chiefly on
the Australian end of the Barnardo
Homes scheme. He was president of the
N. Cricket Assoc., and has been a
member of the Board of Control since it
started.
Constable Harold Blackman, Bris-
bane’s only solicitor-policeman, has re-
signed from the force to have another
try at the law. He has been functioning
successfully as a cop for three years, and
claims to be the only member of his pro-
fession in Australia who has had such
an experience.
“Jeames” : Captain Howard Kerr, who
is coming to Australia as Prince Henry’s
equerry, is a cadet of one of England’s
great semi-Catholic families. He num-
bers both parsons and priests among his
kinsmen. He is a grandson of the late
Colonel Lord Robert Kerr, fourth son
of the fifth Marquess of Lothian, and his
father is Chamberlain to the Pope ; he
himself was made Private Chamberlain to
his Holiness in 1928. The 11th Hussars is
his regiment, and he numbers the Royal
Humane Society’s medal among his deco-
rations. One of his cousins, Captain
Beauchamp Kerr, became A.D.C. to
Governor - General Northcote 30-odd
years ago. Captain Beauchamp Kerr has
been on more vice-regal staff's since than
either Lord Richard Nevill or the late
Sir Edward Wallington.
Leonard Slade, head serang of the
book departments at Robertson and
Mullens, became doyen of Australian
booksellers when George Robertson died.
He has been in the trade for 60 years.
Born at Clunes he came to Melbourne in
1874. After two years with the Religious
Tract Society under the noted Rev. W.
R. Wade, he joined up with R. and M.
He has been there ever since.
Donald Thomson has won the Harbi-
son-Higinbotham scholarship of £lOO
at Melbourne University with his study of
two traditional he r > cults of the N.Q. abo.
He heard the saga from the old men of a
tribe of which he is a full member.
Thomson is a spare, active Victorian who
has spent years among the natives. He
was offered by the University to the
Federal Government to pour anthropolo-
gical oil on the troubled waters of
Arnhem Land, but Canberra thought it
knew better, and left it to a missionary.
Charles Gilmour, who died in Sydney
the day after Anzac Day, was a valued
Bulletin contributor. Some of his best
stories and verses were about members
of the A.1.F., in which he had served.
“lodine” was included in a recent
anthology of best Australian stort stories.
The Rev. S. Varcoe Cocks, who died
of a heart seizure on Saturday, first made
his name at the Newcastle Central
Methodist Mission as a colleague of the
late Rev. Rainsford Bavin, father of the
ex-Premier. Two years after his ordi-
nation he was elected president of the
N.S.W. Christian Endeavor Union. But
his outstanding gift consisted in a capa-
city to understand human problems and
clarify issues, and he did his best work
as director of the Methodist Young
People’s Department. He was only 55
when the end came.
“D.”: G. B. Shaw gave a Maoriland
architect the advt. of a lifetime at a civic
reception in Christchurch. “When I
saw the local R.C. Cathedral,” he told
his audience, “I suddenly thought of
Brunelleschi, and I went in to look at
it. I saw that they had already produced
a Brunelleschi in Christchurch.”
There should be cathedrals by that man
in all your towns. Why have 1 dragged this
in? Not because I have been bribed by
the architect, because I don’t know his
name.
Francis William Petre was the architect,
and he couldn’t have bribed Shaw, as
he died in 1918. He was a member of
the ancient English Catholic family
whose head is Lord Petre. There are
many Petres in M.L. —most of them in
Dunedin and thereabouts.
T. C. Trautwein, M.L.C., was stupe-
fied to learn last week that there is a
likelihood of police proceedings being
taken against him for defacing his gold
pass. He is alleged to have offended by
putting a £9OO diamond into the thing.
Mr. Trautwein may be a child as regards
politics, but he can claim to be an
T. C. TRAUTWEIN, M.L.C., and his
diamond-studded gold pass.
authority on esthetics ; no member or ex-
member of Sydney Trades Hall has worn
more or more beautiful diamonds. He
walks in beauty, as Shelley might have
said, like a political knight. The draw-
ing shows him doing it.
Father O’Leary, the astronomer of
Riverview, who periodically scoops the
Australian cable services with news of
earthquakes in far lands, would have
made a first-class flat-race jockey. Any-
how, he is the right height and weight.
Science and art (he is devoted to music
and painting) gained what sport lost. He
was educated at Clongowes and Louvain
University, where he made his first seis-
mograph. It was erected at Limerick
Father O’LEARY, of Riverview
Observatory.
Observatory, only to be wrecked three
days later by the big Turkestan earth-
quake of 1910. He has patented many
inventions since which have had better
luck; for example, one of his instru-
ments is still going strong in Dublin,
where he was born, and where he was
stationed till he came to Sydney five years
ago.
“EL V.”:
Finney Isles will not seem the same business
to a lot of old-time Queenslanders with W. J.
Coakes out of the managing-directorship, which
he relinquished a few days ago. He has been
43 years with the firm, and since the death of
his colleague, W. J. Kilroe, his has been the
main controlling mind. His celebrated laugh
cheered many a shareholder in tight -corners
of the past. He will still retain the chairman-
ship, the traditions of which were established
by another well-known Queenslander—F. T.
Brentnall. Brentnall was a parson. One of the
bridegrooms he married was the Tichborne
Claimant. Deserting the church for commerce,
he flourished into his ninth decade, and to
the last used to meet the annual meeting’s feli-
citations on his continued good health with the
utterance of a pious wish that “next year will
give us more and more dividends.”
“H.W.M.”: Judge Foster, of Vic.
County Court Bench, is president of the
Melbourne Rationalist Association, which
meets in the Empire Theatre, Bourke-
street, every Sunday night. The assoc,
claims that its membership has been
greatly increased since the Angus con-
troversy began. The Judge has a sense of
humor. The other day the parties to a
suit were not in attendance. “Strike it
out,” said Mr. Foster. A few seconds
later they rushed in. “Strike it in again,”
said his Honor. Oddly enough, most of
his quips have a parsonical flavor.
A 74-year-old Anglican bishop who is
also a knight and who holds more war
decorations than most generals has been
unobtrusively holding services in Sydney
Town Hall and suchlike places for the
past few weeks. This is the Rt. Rev. John
Taylor Smith, K.C.8., C. 8., C.V.0., etc.
Beginning his war service in the Ashanti
campaign 40 years ago, he was chaplain-
general to the forces when he started
drawing his retired pay in 1925.
M.L. hadn’t to look far for the reci-
pient of the first Sidey Summertime
medal, which, with £lOO, is to be
awarded annually to a Maorilander who
has distinguished himself in scientific re-
search. Lord Rutherford got it. The
award commemorates the lifework of
G. K. Sidey, who fought a lifelong battle
for daylight saving, and lived to see a
modified form of it adopted by the
Dominion.
“Whitehall”: Unless a public man dies
in bed surrounded by half a dozen
doctors rumors are invariably started
either that he met a sticky end or that he
never died at all, and is functioning else-
where under a different name. This
explains Colonel Hutchison s film-story
about King Albert having been “tapped
on the back of the head” by Communists.
The yarn implies that the King's friends
were in with the murderers and carried
the corpse to the mountains for the
purposes of a faked accident. Paris
scandal sheets are saying that the King
discovered he had cancer and suicided.
The obvious truth is never sensational
enough for such ghouls.
The late David Carment was a nona-
genarian who was expected by his friends
to live to- be 100. He engaged in in-
numerable activities, and, until recently,
would never admit to feeling tired. He
was a Scottish actuary, and came to
Sydney 62 years ago to join the staff
of the A.M.P. Committeeman and one
time hon. treasurer of the Presbyterian
Church, he was also hon. treasurer of the
Australian Assoc, for the Advancement
of Science, hon. treasurer of the Royal
Society, vice-commodore of the R.P.Y.
Club and owner of several well-known
yachts, including Athena.
Norman McGhie, who was counsel for
The Bulletin in its recent successful
libel actions, traces his descent via Glas-
gow to Skye, but was born in Gympie
(Q.). There he had a job in a goldmine
and began to study law. He became
associate to Samuel Griffith when Griffith
was Chief Justice of the Common-
wealth, and also served for a time
with Edmund Barton. Called to the
Bar just before the war, he spent most

of his early years of practice fight-
ing a prolonged action, Australia v. Wil-
helm the Second, which was tried mainly
on the French Western Circuit. His
original retainer was 6s. a day, but this
was increased as he gained experience
and damage from the defendant in the
shape of a shrapnel-shattered arm. After
the war his quiet courtesy and dogged
tenacity in court soon won him a. sub-
stantial practice which, though it is ex-
tensive and vicarious, allows him to fit
in a few hours occasionally on the golf
course and to display the prowess as a
fisherman which he shares with all
natives of the shores of Lake Cootharaba,
and which has enabled him to develop a
highly original and successful technique.

The fully-paid £2O shares, which had
dropped to £3O in the market about four
years ago, now fetch £65 ss. The re-
covery has been due chiefly to the cheap-
ening of money, strong competition for
sound securities and improvement in
earnings. The return at £65 ss. is 3.8
p.c. on a 12i p.c. div. basis, and some-
thing very extraordinary would need to
happen before the 12-y p.c. would be
interrupted. Indeed, if earnings continue
on the same scale as for last year, and
conditions generally grow more settled,
it may not be long before the market
again begins to dream dreams.
What a sweet thing it has been for
shareholders is made plain by the fact
that, in addition to an uninterrupted run
of \2\ p.c. distributions, they have re-
ceived £7,325,000 of bonus scrip, raising
paid capital to £9,750,000, of which
£3,900,000 was returned in cash, leaving
£5,850,000. What the future holds for
the business nobody can say definitely.
Still, with things as they are, it would
be difficult for the co. to avoid earning
good profits. It has large accumulations,
visible and otherwise, assets have been
mostly paid for out of earnings, and then
vigorously written down from the same
source, and the contract with the Gov-
ernment for refining, selling and financ-
ing all but a fraction of Australia’s sugar
requirements is a nice anchor for earn-
ings. Also, Empire preference has taken
a bit of the sting out of the low price
for sugar in the world’s markets. Ex-
change, however, has made this prefer-
ence worth less in Canada than in the
U.K., with a consequent diversion of
supplies. Hence the talk of quota re-
strictions on sugar imported into Britain ;
and the co.’s general manager has gone
to London to watch its interests.
Last year Australia’s outturn of raws
(666,552 tons) was a record, local con-
sumption (348,705 tons) improved, and
the co.’s declared net earnings for the 12
months to March 31 sprang £171,088,
reaching 16.4 p.c. on capital as against
13.5 p.c. for the preceding year. That
was after adding £98,797 to the replace-
ments and depreciation reserve and
£120,114 to suspense accounts (£3,220,288,
which is partly provision against con-
tingencies).
Here is the skeleton of the business as
the published figures show it:

Allowing for the final div., the year’s
improvement in the net asset position
was £333,868. But what catches the eye
is the fine store of liquids:

Liquid surplus .. £1,889,077 £3,678,124 £3,917,079
Shareholders are thus £2,028,002 better
off than they were seven years ago. Re-
cently the deed of settlement was altered
to allow the co. to extend its activities
beyond its present sphere and territory.
Exactly what the board’s intentions are
in this connection it has kept to itself.

After dropping something into the con-
tingencies account, which is lumped with
bills payable, etc. (£4,576,979, up
£660,998), in the sheet, the ’Asia, which
does a large turnover in the exchange
market, exhibited a slip of £48,331 in
last year’s gross earnings (£1,069,702).
Yet for the year to June 30 last there
was a spring of over £25,000*000 in the
value of Australia’s total external trade
(£154,871,000), the exchange rate was
steady, business improved locally, the
amount at fixed deposit and the price
paid for the money were both less than
in the previous term, and the manage-
ment was able to put a bit more of the
funds at work —the ratio of advances
to deposits improved from 81.3 p.c. at
the close of accounts in 1932 to 82.6 p.c.
at Oct. 16 last. Management charges,
etc. (£629,465), were up £5052. Visibly
it was the contraction of £56,921 in rates
and taxes (£181,729) that lifted the net
result to 5.7 p.c. on the £4,500,000 of
capital as against 5.6, 4.8, 13.6, 15, 15.8
and 16.3 back to 1927.
An extra half of one per cent, was
distributed, making p.c. for the year,
the final being at the rate of 8 p.c. p.a.
But income tax (ss. in the £) reduced the
actual return to 5.6 p.c. It was paid in
sterling, which makes 5.6 p.c. worth 7
p.c. to Australian and Maoriland’ share-
holders at the current rate of exchange.
Because of share premiums, however, the
div. is worth little more than half the de-
clared rate on most of the capital. Thus
shareholders have not fared nearly so well
as the bare figures suggest. However, owing
to the cheapening of money and the im-
provement in the outlook, the market has
lengthened its bid for the £lO shares paid
to £5 —the other £5 is a contingent lia-
bility payable only in the event of liqui-
dation- —from £lO ss. to £l3 over the
last 12 months. Allowing for exchange
and the tax already referred to, the re-
turn at £l3 is 2.7 p.c. on a 1\ p.c. div.
basis, or 3.6 p.c. on a nominal 10 p.c.
distribution. The cover is £lO 3s. 4d. in
net tangibles, which means that a 10 p.c.
div. would call for a shade under 5 p.c.
on capital and reserves combined.
To meet a shrinkage of £287,280 in
deposits, add £235,151 net to advances
and £866,371 to bills discounted, etc.,
liquids were drawn upon for £706,876,
and there was a growth of £660,998 in
acceptances, etc.-

This big shipping and merchandising
organisation, whose interests extend
round the Australian coast, out over the
Pacific islands and north to Java and
elsewhere, is a steady 10 p.c. proposition
with possibilities. The market, which
has always had a high opinion of the
scrip, lengthened its bid for the pound
shares from 50s. 6d. to 575. over the
last 12 months. At 575. (the price was
never higher) the return is 3.5 p.c. on a
10 p.c. div. basis. The investor who
looks for a shade over 4 p.c. on his
money counts on a 12 p.c. div. or bene-
fits from other directions. A 12 p.c. div.
would call for £lBO,OOO (£42,988 less
than was netted for the 12 months cov-
ered by the latest accounts), or a shade
under 6 p.c. on capital and reserves com-
bined. Since 1920 over £1,500,000 has
been openly struck off for depreciation,
etc. This liberal provision for contin-
gencies and the comparative steadiness
of earnings suggest that the chief
assets are well worth their book
value. It also indicates caution, which
may mean that the outlook will need to
improve considerably before extra bene-
fits are likely to be distributed.
The year’s sales of merchandise
showed an “appreciable increase,” while
earnings from the shipping section were
maintained, despite foreign competition,
but trading in Papua and the Mandated
Territory was affected by the collapse of
copra prices. The South Seas offshoot,
which took over part of the parent’s busi-
ness in 1920 for a half-million in scrip,
paid 5 p.c., and Queensland Insurance,
of whose £500,000 of capital 8.-P. owns
nearly half, kept its div. at 10 p.c. Gross
earnings from all sources (£735,587) were
£23,076 better. Management charges
(£427,487) were £1793 lighter, but an
extra £30,142 was allowed for depre-
ciation, etc. (£104,543). Including £19,731
dropped from somewhere into the “in-
surance branch and other reserves” (now
£516,419), the net result was 14.8 p.c. on
capital as against 14.6, 12.3, 16.1, 16.3
and 16.5 p.c. back to 1929. That is dis-
regarding £25,000 struck off the book
value of plantations owing to the glum
outlook for copra.

The spring of £67,375 in the book value
of fixed assets is due partly to the pur-
chase of a new passenger and cargo
motor vessel —the Malaita —for the Solo-
mon Islands service. The year’s shrink-
age in the more or less liquil surplus
(£58,683) was £39,387.

The table shows what a stunning blow
slump dealt the motor trade and the
extraordinary recovery of the industry
over the last 12 months, when the value
of chassis imported more than doubled.
The two old businesses had been highly
prosperous, but the present co. —it
welded the interests of General Motors
(Australia) Pty. and Holden’s, the motor-
body builders of Adelaide, as from the
middle of 1930 —was caught with heavy
stocks on a falling market, and the body
works, planned on a mass-production
basis, came almost to a standstill, while
jazzing currencies added to the compli-
cations. Thus losses totalling £869,109
were registered for the two and a half
years to the end of 1932.
Then the tide began to turn. The book
value of stocks had been adjusted to the
new level of prices, the gap between the
dollar and the Australian pound nar-
rowed, reducing the loss on exchange,
and imports of chassis into Australia
more than doubled during 1933. Both
sections of the business became profitable.
After paying exes, and setting aside
£108,516 for depreciation, etc., £134,161
of profit remained. It was £49,921 in
excess of accrued pref. divs. to Sept. 7
last (£84,240). But the debt called for
reduction, so only £33,696 (= 6 p.c. lor
the year to March, 1932) was distributed.
The £100,465 that remained reduced the
amount of ord. capital unrepresented by
tangibles to £252,713 when the books
closed.
There was marked improvement in the
financial position:

The year’s allowance for depreciation,
etc., together with a reduction of £52,243
in the book value of stocks, and of
£30,064 in cash, etc., enabled £299,530 to
be knocked off the debt. The spring in
the more or less liquid surplus (£571,021,
including stocks) was £279,914.
Immediate indications are that the co.
will make a better showing at next balance.
At Woodville about 2000 bodies will be
turned out during each of the next five
months, whereas only 2046 were pro-
duced for the year to June 30, 1932.
Also the export of bodies to Java and
Southern Asia is expected to increase,
the car-assembly works at Sydney have
reopened, and those at Brisbane may
open up again presently.
On the market the prefs. have advanced
from 12s. 6d. to 235. 9d. over the last
12 months. The return at the higher
figure is 5 p.c., plus arrears. The cover

Seasonal conditions, which affect the
quantity of cane passed through the
rollers, etc., and the size of the export
surplus and the price it fetches abroad
are the chief factors governing earn-
ings of growers and millers in the sugar
industry. This co., which operates in the
Bundaberg district, crushed £21,117 tons
of cane in 1931. It handled about a
quarter of that quantity in the follow-
ing year, due to a dry spell, followed by
severe frosts, and a loss of £3559 showed
up. Last year 118,070 tons were put
through. But the outturn of raws for
the whole State (about 621,000 tons) was

the biggest yet, being approximately
40,000 in excess of the previous peak
figure for 1931. Australian consumption
was 348,700 tons ; the balance had to
be sold overseas at low prices.
Because of all this and a cut of yd. per
pound in the Australian retail price of
fines, last year’s average price for raws is
expected to be about £l7 2s. 6d. per ton,
or £2 3s. 7d. less than for the previous
season.
After £9157 net had been dropped into
the depreciation reserve (£97,956) the
profit was 6.1 p.c. on capital as against
a loss, 8.8, 6.7, 8.1, 8.3 and 12.9 p.c. back
to 1927, and 6 p.c. was distributed.
During the year £30,874 was added to
the book value of fixed assets, mainly
on account of the irrigation scheme, now
almost complete—the idea is to guard
against the effects of dry spells upon the
growth and sugar content of the cane:

another good crushing, and the co. may
do a bit better. The market, however,

This little Brisbane carrying concern,
which took over the then 10-year-old
business of City and Suburban Parcel
Delivery, Bryce, Ltd., in 1910, has got
along very well on a capital of £27,000,
of which £lO,OOO is in 6 p.c. cum. prefs.,
which advance with the ords. after the
latter have had 10 p.c., and enjoy priority
as to capital and share in surplus assets.
After prefs. were handed their 6 p.c. the
ords. averaged 9.6 p.c. for the five years
to the close of accounts in 1924. Then
the importing boom brought richer har-
vests, and for the next quinquennium
the prefs. averaged 10 p.c. and the ords.
14 p.c. During the last four generally
depressing years the ord, div. dropped
from 10 p.c. to 6 p.c., but was lifted to
7 p.c. last year, though reserves had to
be tapped for £l4O to do it. That was
because of a special call from the tax-
gatherer for an extra £6OO. Gross earn-
ings (£11,746) were £1094 better.
Prospects of earnings from the carry-
ing business being maintained during the
current term seem bright enough. Also,
the co. is converting the Adelaide-street
frontage of its freehold into shops. The
market notes this and has lengthened its
bid for the ords. from 225. to 255. over
the last twelve months. At 255. the return
is 5.5 p.c. on a 7 p.c. div. basis. The
prefs. at 235. (21s. a year ago) return
5.2 p.c. on a 6 p.c. distribution. The
cover, all shares, is 345. 6d. in net
tangibles.

Gold Specs.
In the past Stock Exchange booms in
the gold-mining business have been asso-
ciated with new discoveries. Now the
depreciation of paper currencies, which
has made the yellow stuff worth about
twice what it used to be in Australian
notes, has provided the industry with
fresh opportunities. Nevertheless, the
present rush for gold scrip suggests that
many of those who have joined in know
nothing worth mentioning about their
purchases. It is the unproved ore that
is the magnet in most mining ventures,
which may be classed as (1) a gamble,
(2) a speculation or (3) an investment.
No fixed lines of demarkation can be
drawn between them, and it is often diffi-
cult to determine whether a proposition
is being handled with one or both eyes
on the share market rather than on the
future of the property as a mine.
The investor buys shares or deben-
tures in more or less well-established and
strong concerns, while the gambler hopes
to get his money back, and more besides,
not from the mine but from other
gamblers. The legitimate speculator buys
in the hope of the venture succeeding.
He frequently has so little spare money
that one good investment would not
greatly affect his income, but one lucky
speculation would. He is of great value
to mining and other enterprises.
One of the numerous things the specu-
lator needs to carefully watch is that the
co. or syndicate has enough money, or
command of enough, to thoroughly test
a property. Inadequacy in this re-
spect is sometimes camouflaged by hand-
picking, say, 50 tons of stone and send-
ing it to a smelter, and by exhibiting rich
specimens as “ore,” whereas both parcels
were really concentrates masquerading as
ore. Bulk parcels and samples yielding
high returns are a signal to carefully
investigate rather than to rush into a
prospect. More blanks than prizes are
drawn in the mining business. Still, shal-
low workings sometimes overlie great
bodies of secondary enrichment, and
some veins persist at depth. Look hard
at reports on a mining prospect by other
than a qualified mining engineer. The
quantity and quality of ore, the market
price of the metal, the cost of treating
the stone and the figure at which the
venture is capitalised are usually the de-
termining factors in the long run.
Australian Roma Oil has decided to
suspend testing operations at No. 19
Wallumbilla bore (Q.) to plug off the oil-
gas sands, and to put the well in shape
for handing over to the Bendemere Shire
Council. It was found impossible to
clean out the bottom of the hole (7fin.
in diameter) through the 4in. pipe set
at 4768 ft. The well proved the existence
of rich petroliferous gas in the sands,
and the ground in the neighborhood is
to be geologically surveyed, and, if neces-
sary, scout-bored to determine the apex
of the structure. After this has been
done, another deep bore is to be put
down.

Chiefly on the strength of a few rich
surface assays, Arnheim Land’s con-
tribs. (2s. paid to Is. 3d.) have gone to
15s. 6d. in the market. There are 133,334
of them, and 66,000 paids, taken by the
vendor. In February over soz. stone
was reported from the bottom of a 60ft.
shaft, and American and English in-
terests were said to be nibbling at the
show. Nothing has since been heard
about the option-hunters, or to what
extent, if any, the lode in the shaft has
been developed.

“Old Warden”: Bismarck Ranges,
floated some years ago to extract gold
from the backbone of New Guinea, later
decided to try nearer home, and took up
some leases on the old Lucknow (N.S.W.)
field. Lately it has met with considerable
success, and last week declared its third
dividend. By way of encouraging share-
holders, the co. has resorted to old-time
methods, and when the latest chunk of
bullion was tipped out of the retort it
was exhibited at various places round
Sydney, including Parliament House,
where its extreme weight ensured its
safety. The bullion is valued at £9OOO
in Australian notes, and shareholders are
confident there is plenty more in the
mine, the scrip having been on the rise
for some time. Capital is £45,600 in
2s. 6d. shares, priced at 13s. or there-
abouts on the market.

Lake View is busy yoking up Asso-
ciated to its Golden Mile team. Chairman
J. A. Agnew says that a large and pros-
perous undertaking, with modern plant
and big resources, could obviously make
a substantial profit out of the smaller
neighboring mine, whose higher treatment
and power costs would preclude it from
doing as well. The Associated board has
not yet announced what it proposes to
do. The market expects a part return
of capital in cash, plus one Lake View
for every six Associateds. Duncan Mc-
Aulay, who ably managed the Associated
for 23 years, and whose contract has not
yet expired, is expected to be rewarded
by the board.
* * * *
From London: —In reply to a share-
holder at the recent Lake View meeting
chairman J. A. Agnew said that there
was no necessity for Lake View to worry
about shortage of payable ore. It had
ample reserves for several years to come,
and developments were proving very satis-
factory. C. Prior, general manager of
Wiluna, who had been invited by Agnew
to address the meeting, said that he had
been down the Lake View several times.
It had enormous reserves; it was a great
mine, and had a good manager.

“O.B.”: Triton (W.A.) is further ahead
with mining operations than stated in B.
25/4/’34. At that date the shaft in Emu
North section was down 300 ft., and, after
a little extension, a crosscut had exposed
3ft. of the reef. The shaft in the Emu
section, 1000 ft. from the Emu North
shaft, was down 267 ft. Where No. 14
bore cut the reef near Emu shaft at a
depth of 300 ft., values were estimated at
525. 3d. over a width of 30ft., with gold
at £7 an ounce, Australian currency.

Goldmines are being named after
brands of beer in Westralia. One, the
Swan Bitter, in the Sandstone district,
after yielding 3000 oz. of the metal, has
been optioned to a local co., which
reckons that its fortune is made. Some
time ago one of the present vendors
gave a case of Swan beer for his interest
in the show, and he and the seller then
drank the beer. The “Wild Cat” has
heard of mines in Westralia being sold
for fizz in the early days, but new cur-
rencies are springing up everywhere
now.

Timoni Gold Mines has been formed
to take over a property in the Mt. Ida
district, 60 miles north-west of Menzies
(W.A.). Melbourne is finding part of
£37,500 of capital, which has been over-
subscribed. Vendors take 35,000 f.-ps.
in part-payment. The existence of 20,000
tons of 15dwt. ore is mentioned, and it is
intended to instal plant to treat that
quantity annually.

Jock Thomson, who has introduced
English capital into Westralia for the
treatment of Nullagine conglomerates,
reports that up to 30dwt. a ton has been
discovered in a dump, while a second
deposit has been disclosed 100 ft. below
the present bed. The late A. E. Mor-
gans mined 5000 tons from the formation
for an average of 12dwt.

Discussing Dr. Loftus Hill’s remarks
on Kalgoorlie lodes and calc-schist in the
“Chemical Engineering and Mining
Review,” C. G. Gibson says it has always
been well known that lodes just as strong
and persistent as those in the greenstone
occur within the calc-schist area, but so
far they have, almost without exception,
proved to be unremunerative.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(1) How many plants manufacture plaster
of paris in N. S. Wales ? (2) Imports of
plaster of paris into N. S. Wales ? (3) Distance
from Sydney by rail of nearest commercial
gypsum deposits ? (4) Any opening for a small
but efficient plaster of paris manufacturing
plant in N. S. Wales ? —1230.
(1) None on a large scale. Australian Gyp-
sum Products manufactures in Melbourne
plaster of paris from S. Aus. gypsum, and
supplies the bulk of N. S. Wales requirements.
(2) From other States: Year ending June 30,
1931, 4147 tons; 1932, 2690 tons; 1933, 5475
tons; six months ending Dec. 31, 1933, 4405
tons. From overseas: Year 1930-31, 1689.2
tons valued at £13,771; 1931-32, 309.3
tons valued at £1900; 1932-33, 406.6 tons valued
at £2390. (3) The most important deposits
occur at Beilpargerie, live miles from railway
and 537 miles from Sydney. (4) Unless costs
and selling prices could be lowered, it would
be very difficult to win a profitable market.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
S.P.P.: (1) Loss of revenue involved is about
£60,000 p.a., which ought to be partly oft'set
by returns from royalties. The co. has not
put every penny on the table either. (2) De-
pends upon terms on which, the business was
taken over... .R.G.: (1) and (2) Last year
co. netted 7.4 p.c. on capital and paid 5 p.c.
Earnings promise to improve, but doubtful

SHADOW SHOWS.
“Friday, the 13th”
For years 90 per cent, of the talkies
Australia got from England were worth-
less, and The Bulletin alone among
Sydney papers said so. They starred
young men who looked like girls, and
girls who dressed like the belles of a
West Kensington charity hop. One
effort, which was highly praised by mis-
guided pro-Britons here, showed a mani-
cured farmer riding a carriage horse
across country by night—with the hedges
in full leaf.
The slump has caused Continental and
American film specialists to concentrate
on the most solvent country; the best
British actors and actresses, who have
always been better than America’s best,
are accepting all the film contracts they
can get, and Australia, amongst other
nations, is benefiting. The Regent is
showing two splendid films with virtually
all-English casts, and now comes the
Prince Edward with two more, which
are, if possible, superior as studies of the
life they set out to depict.
“Friday, the 13th” is right in every de-
tail. In each shot, from the Caledonian
Market on a fine day to Whitehall on a
rainy night, the essential atmosphere is
achieved.
No Hollywood picture has been better
cast. The only weak characters are
Robertson Hare, who rather overacts his
familiar role of a worm, and Frank Law-
ton, who is stagy as the persecuted hero.
Emlyn Williams’s blackmailer is the
brainiest creation seen on any screen
since Laughton’s Nero. It is sensational
in its insight and power. Max Miller
is great as a cheery Caledonian Market
crook; so is Sonnie Hale (Alf, the ’bus
conductor). Mary Jerrold, the vague,
amiable wife of a city magnate (Edmund
Gwenn), is the best of the women, but
Muriel Aked, as an elderly spinster with
a small nephew at heel, runs her close.
The plot, which is founded on a recent
novel by Biddy Worger, has evidently
been chosen with an eye to the immense
amount of available talent. It shows the
characters facing various unrelated pro-
blems which are solved by a ’bus smash.
"Just Smith”
This Tom Walls comedy suffers by con-
trast with “Friday, the 13th.” It has one
of the six basic plots, and the profiteer
splendors of Monte Carlo have been done
to death by the Americans. Things im-
prove when the action shifts to a country
house in the ’Shires. The writer has
never been able to derive any emotion
but annoyance from past English films
which have shown alleged followers of
the Quorn or Belvoir cantering through
June woods on animals like Suffolk
Punches. Cockney directors who have
never been further from Leicester-square
than Clacton may perpetrate such
examples of cinematographic cubism;
Tom Walls knows too much. In “Just
Smith” everything is as representational
as an interior by Velasquez. The poker
game and the thoroughbred hunters clip-
clopping along a macadam road in
Northamptonshire stand out, but it is
impossible to fault any of it as a genre
picture.
The only entirely unconvincing feature
is Wall? as the cardsharping, pocket-
picking burglar hero ; he would have
been spotted in such an environment
inside 24 hours. On the other hand, he
is more convincing and amusing than any
of the other actors who have played
similar parts in previous plays and talkies.
“Coming-out Party”
This Sydney Capitol film had the un-
usual experience of being heartily bar-
racked on the first night. It is too
saccharine for Sydney—which is saying a
good deal.
Beautiful and wealthy Frances Dee
falls in love with the first fiddler of a
jazz band (Gene Raymond). It is per-
fectly obvious that the rich debutante
and the indigent jazzist will be united at
the fade-out. Meanwhile the audience
has to sit through the intervening compli-
cations, which are supplied by a dissi-
pated youth who is favored as a suitor
by her relations.
Alison Skipworth is amusing as a com-
mission-hunting social adviser, and Nigel
Bruce scores as a Scotch butler.
“The Circus Queen Murder”
Adolphe Menjou is an overworked
police commissioner who, while holiday-
ing, learns that trouble is brewing in a
travelling circus. A trapeze artist has
stolen the affections of a colleague’s wife.
Also some cannibals are getting restless.
The night the peanut-eating commissioner
takes over, the aerial wonder whose wife
has strayed is supposedly murdered.
There is evidence of murder, but the
corpse is missing. Menjou rightly sus-
pects that the murder is a fake. Despite
his efforts the wife is killed. Menjou is
now faced with the task of saving her
lover’s life and bringing the murderer
to book. How he lives up to his reputa-
tion and gets his man is revealed in a
series of well-dovetailed episodes.
Greta Nissen (murdered girl), Dwight
Frye (murderer) and Donald Cook
(lover) are in the cast.
“Deluge”
A vast amount of cash must have
flowed from the till to produce this
earthquake idyll at Hoyt’s, Melbourne.
A tidal wave sweeps over the Statue
of Liberty; transatlantic liners are
lifted into Broadway; the whole pack-
ing-case architecture of New York
collapses. Several Hollywood stars out-
live the cataclysm. Lois Wilson awakes
to find herself riven of husband and
children on a newly-created island. She
links up with two male survivors. The
bigger one massacres his rival, but the
prize escapes by swimming to the main-
land in brassieres and flimsies. Here she
is found by Sidney Blackmer, who takes
TALKIES AT THE REGENT, SYDNEY.
Elissa Landi and Ronald Colman in “The Masquerader” and the Walt Disney
classic “Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?”
her into his hut, though not to his bosom.
They love each other, but he has his pre-
flood principles and so has she. It is
just as well. In New York they find his
wife heroically preserving her virtue
against desperate odds. He returns to
domesticism.; Miss Wilson, stripping her-
self once more to her underclothing,
takes to the water and swims away to
eternity. Or it may be to the pay-desk.
The thing is 'deficient in even ordinary
intelligence. At enormous expense, and
with considerable imagination, a situa-
tion is built up which would offer
abounding opportunities to a Shaw, a
Wells or even aJ. M. Barrie. It is then
handed over to the romance-merchants,
who make a shambles of it.
Sundry Shows
When, through the office-boy getting
the tickets mixed, the Sporting Critic
found himself listening to the first
Pouishnoff-Stevens concert at Sydney
Town Hall, instead of being at the Uni-
versity boxing, he decided, as it was
raining hard, to stick it out and let the
musical expert make the best he could of
the stoush.
Pouishnoff’s appearance was somewhat
disappointing. His hair was not at all
musical; in fact, he didn’t have much
more than the average bruiser, and he
had none of the dynamic personality that
marks the musician in the talkies. Still,
he seemed to be able to play all right.
The audience certainly thought so, and
the critic could find nothing to cavil at.
He overheard neighbors talking of the
performer’s sureness of tone values in
the Bach-Liszt “Organ Prelude and
Fugue in A Minor,” and of the “cob-
web delicacy” of his treatment of the
ballet music from “Rosamunde,” but he
preferred merely to enjoy it without
analysis.
Horace Stevens had a more command-
ing presence, and slightly more hair, and
it was almost worth missing the slather-
and-whack stuff to hear him. Of his first
bunch of songs, “Music Shall All Your
Cares Beguile” (Purcell) was the most
pleasing, except for a slight difficulty with
his breathing two-thirds through. [The
Musical Critic denies this ; having dis-
covered his mistake about half-way
through the third round, he left the Uni.
Hall and arrived just at this stage and
took over the job.] Horace Stevens was
a delight throughout all his pieces, reveal-
ing wonderful control of his fine voice.
The restraint of the Purcell songs was in
striking contrast to the strength and
power of “Sea Fever” and “To-morrow.”
Comment on Pouishnoff’s offering of
Liszt’s “Sonata in B Minor” would be
gratuitous. The man’s hands are fascinat-
ing to watch. He seems possessed of a
score of fingers. But it was in Chopin
that he achieved his greatest triumph ;
and the five pieces, concluding with the
“F Sharp Major Nocturne” and “C Sharp
Minor Scherzo,” so transported the audi-
ence that three recalls were necessary—
Bach’s “Sicilienne in G Minor,” the
rippling “La Campanella” (Liszt) and
Strauss’s “Voices of Spring”
The Sporting Critic wants to know why
it was necessary for Harold Smith to
play Stevens’s accompaniments. Not that
he didn’t play them excellently, but it
seemed to him that Pouishnoff could have
done just as well and saved the extra
expense. But he supposes that musicians,
like pugilists, are bad businessmen.
Saturday’s programme was all Chopin
music, and Pouishnoff played it beauti-
fully. There will be additional concerts
on Thursday and Saturday.
* * *
“The Widow’s Might,” a comedy in
three acts written by Eric Bedford, son
of Randolph, was staged on Friday at
the Sydney Savoy in aid of the A.J.A.’s
Benevolent Fund. It tells the story of
a marriage of convenience between
Michael van Wurster and Helen Dayles-
ford, whose families have dreamt of an
amalgamation of their shipping interests.
But Michael is infatuated with another,
and the girl is gone on a poet. It is
reserved for a tactful widow to help the
young people out of their difficulties in
an unorthodox though effective fashion.
The dialogue is very frank, but a hard-
boiled journalistic audience showed no
sign of disapproval. Gwen Sherwood (as
the widow), Wendy Woolfrey and Rod-
ney Maynard shared acting honors.
They were assisted by Joan Mcllrath,
Ron Roberts, Cam Pratt, Zoie Desbois
and the author himself —as Uncle
Barney. W. Lane-Bayliff produced the
thing. It is a bit long-winded here and
there, but is the makings of a pretty
good play.
* * *
Sydney Players’ Club put on J. B.
Priestley’s “The Roundabout” on Satur-
day .at St. James’s Hall, and did it un-
commonly well. It is not in Priestley’s
best style, but there are sufficient action
(up to the end of the second act, anyhow)
and fun enough to satisfy all but the
hypercritical. The characters include
Lord Kettlewell, who is trying to stave
off bankruptcy and appease Hilda Land-
court ; his daughter Pamela, who wor-
ships at the shrine of Lenin ; Staggles, a
Communist with a weakness for pretty
legs; Churton-Saunders, a middle-aged
loafer with a witty tongue; Lady
Knightsbridge, a gossip and moneygrub ;
and Parsons, a butler who puts his sav-
ings in sweeps. Arthur O’Keefe was the
success of the evening as Staggles, and
Marjorie Cumberland was next-best as
Pamela. John Copeman, Beatrice Wines,
Kenneth Fowles, Eileen Dinley, Edward
Cavill, Liese Fels and Trixie Gore helped.
S. R. Irving produced the show.

Audiences continue to strain the seat-
ing resources of Melbourne King’s, where
“The Dubarry” is making her nightly
descent into sin and obtaining absolu-
tion as the mistress of a king. “The
Troubles of Hector” are Jim Gerald’s
concern this week at the Tiv.
* * *
At the Princess, Melbourne, the success
of “The Beloved Vagabond” appears to
be an accomplished fact. The libretto of
Adrian Ross could be improved, but the
music of Dudley Glass serves its cheer-
ful purposes ; the show is admirably cast
and the ship’s crew is settling down to its
job. Gladys Moncrieff, both as singer
and dresser, remains in chronic demand,
and as a spectacle the exhibit is graded
first class.

The only fresh entertainment in Mel-
bourne last week was the Radio Show
at the Town Hall. Except, no doubt, to
the expert, there was an anthem-like
quality about it, and to present observer,
unversed in the mysteries of short waves
and superhets, it was indistinguishable
from last year’s epoch-making produc-
tion. However, this commentator has it
on the authority of a small boy that the
present show is an epoch-maker in its
turn, for the car radio of the police
cycle patrol and the all-wave receivers
are making first appearances, and some
of the broadcasting boxes, which look
like gas stoves gone gay, give forth a
mellower and more beautiful tone than
ever before. If that is so, there must
be some new criterion of excellence other
than the human voice, for, although the
sounds. these robots make are not un-
pleasing in themselves, they bear little
resemblance to any human original. To
test this statement, the visitor has only
to shut his eyes and try to imagine a
human entity he knows behind the tre-
mendous noise. Nobody one ever knew,
not even Kyrle Bellew, Julius Knight or
Yes-No Reid, ever had such gloriously
fruity voices. Nobody ever rolled so
luxuriously in oleaginous vocables. The
post office display consisted of teletypes
and automatic ’phones and other pecu-
liar gadgets. There was a distinct thrill
when Lud Mayor Gengoult Smith hailed
Marconi in a lightsome voice, and that
distinguished scientist responded with a
bellow that might have come from the
lungs of a dinosaur. To the aforemen-
tioned small boy, however, a chat across
the world between a marchese and a
mayoral lord had no sensational appeal,
and he moved away, to become im-
mersed in a six-valve receiver capable
of getting on intimate terms with Eng-
land, France, America, Japan, Russia
and Germany. This astounding fact
appeared to him the most commonplace
thing in the world. What he was inter-
ested in was pentagrid converters, power
pentodes, undistorted outputs, detectors
and oscillators and rectifiers, and con-
cerning these he plied the salesman with
questions which taxed that gentleman’s
science to the last degree. Later he sur-
veyed the pashometer with ineffable scorn.
“Good enough for kids,” he remarked,
and passed on to the Police Depart-
ment’s display.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Frisson”: Cold-weather stories being
due, I am hastening to get in early. This
one comes from Chicago, and tells how
a sparrow that went to drink from a
dripping water-tap was frozen to it by its
bill. The water, trickling over it, froze
the fowl to death in the course of em-
balming it in ice for posterity to marvel
at. The yarn is interesting from several
aspects. For one thing, it dispels the
superstition that no one ever drinks
water in Chicago ; for another, it is a
solemn warning to all animates never to
drink water in winter or any other time
unless in cases of extreme necessity, to
be certified to by responsible medical
authority.
* * * >i=
“Der Jong”: The papers have been
publishing a touching story of how
Prince Henry —soon to visit us, if some-
one else of the family isn’t ticked off
for the job —had an argument with his
expert guide while shooting on the East
African veld. The Prince swore he had
seen a lion go behind an anthill; the
guide was just as sure it was a rhino-
“Who the blazes told you to bring those ewes out to me?”
“Dave did, sir. He said ‘Take ’em to the old bore.’”
ceros. When the Prince went to look
it was a lion, and, having no other
ammunition, he threw his hat at it. The
lion —evidently a member of the no-hat
brigade, like Prince George—bolted in
disgust, and that was that. The inci-
dent, however, indicates the folly of
going anywhere unarmed in that part of
the world. Some years ago I attended
an evening reception at Government
House, Nairobi, after dining well at the
club. Feeling the need of fresh air, I
wandered out into the gardens, and was
attacked by two lions. I was a stout
fella in those days, and, after a struggle
in which I was severely mauled, suc-
ceeded in strangling both the brutes with
my bare hands. I made for the club
and there exhibited my torn clothing and
scratched and bleeding hands and face.
A search party was immediately organ-
ised, but came back with a most ridicu-
lous story. They said all they found
were two dead Pekinese dogs belonging
to Lady Blinkety Blanque, the Governor’s
wife. They added that my injuries had
been received from rolling about among
newly-planted rosebushes, imported from
England at great expense by the
same lady, who was an ardent gardener.
At this juncture a special committee was
appointed to hold me down on the floor
of the bar and sit upon me and my case.
They decided that I must ( a ) apologise
to Lady B.B.; ( b ) resign from the club ;
and (c) get away to Uganda, or Gehenna,
and/or wherever else I liked. I fol-
lowed their advice, except for the
apology. I had met the lady before and
wasn’t such a mug as that.
“Bendee”: I have a couple of old and
well-seasoned pipes—one of them an
Anzac of the 1915 vintage —on my mantel-
shelf. Each summer (when I don’t
smoke) for the last three years wasps
have filled the bowls with mud and pre-
served sniders. Haven’t wasps any sense
of smell?
* * * *
“Selector”: A South Aus. farmer,
called away from his holding for a few
weeks, had to leave two sons, aged 15
and 12 years, to look after everything,
including the drawing of water for stock
from a well, 160 ft. deep. During this
process the bucket came off the
“tumbling-tommy” hook and sank to the
bottom. The elder boy lowered the
younger to the water ; he fished up the
bucket, but wasn’t strong enough to land
it. So Fifteen Years went down ; but the
younger boy was not hefty enough to
turn the windlass. Getting a brace-and-
bit he put a safety-bolt in both its legs. He
was thus able to haul his brother up by
pulling down first on one handle and
then on the other, inserting the bolt at
each half-turn. The nearest neighbor
was 15 miles away.
“Ruat Coelum”: The annual shower
of fish has been getting into the news,
This time in Victoria, where a farmer
found one of his paddocks covered with
small fish, though he is miles away from
any water wherein fish could live. The
usual crop of fool-theories has been
advanced. One individual stated that he
had seen pelicans disgorging fish while
flying over local areas. The objection to
“Proud father, eh, Tohi, me buoy ? T here’s nothing like a baby to brighten
up a home.”
“Too right, py korry! Proomin’ lamp goin’ all night now.”
this was that a very considerable acreage
was covered by the fish and that at least
a couple of thousand pelicans, flying in
close formation, would have been neces-
sary for the job. There seems to be no
doubt nowadays that these showers of
fish are due to their being caught up
with the water in a whirlwind, which con-
verts itself into a land waterspout, and
then being dropped when the thing
breaks. This theory is backed by the
fact that fish on these occasions are
always small and light; if a day comes
when 501 b. Murray cod or a school of
sharks are dropped on the heads of the
local farming community, we can think
about hunting for another one.
* . * * *
“Bogantungan”: A month or so ago
a member of the Council referred to a
legendary Queensland cattleman who
settled on his block with two working
bullocks and mustered some hundred
head of mixed cattle a year later. Some-
times this method of
natural increase—as
some of my old
friends would re-
gard it —comes as a
bolt from the blue
to men preferring
more orthodox
methods. . A N.S.W.
grazier recently re-
ported to the police
that some of his
sheep had been
stolen. A number
were found dead.in
his paddocks, but he
was a flabbergasted
man when a muster
showed that he had
on his own ground
over a hundred
more than he ever thought he owned. The
explanation of the mystery is yet to come.
But somewhere there must be, cursing to
himself, a sheep-stealer who was not
only foiled on this particular bit of his
job but was compelled to abandon loot
gathered elsewhere, lest worse things
happen to him.
* * * *
“Snorter”: Lately I was having a look
at the internal economy of a hen turtle.
I take it for granted that, like unto a
female fowl, a hen turtle is born with all
the eggs inside her which she is ever
going to lay. I also accept the postulate,
though I take a grain of salt with it,
that they start laying about their third
season. I know from many actual obser-
vations that they lay up to about two
hundred eggs at a sitting. I take the word
of better men than myself that a turtle of
a couple of centuries is only in its prime,
Now, accepting all those axioms, let’s
get back to this turtle, which I converted
into steak and other things. Without the
aid of a magnifying-glass I discovered
she was just on the point of doing her
annual job with the eggs —they were all
there ready for laying. I looked further,
and eggs in dwindling sizes seemed to
fill that old thing from stem to stern.
With a bit of pencil and a sheet of paper
I filled in her Family Endowment form.
I found, allowing as above, that the old
turtle had inside her just on 40,000 eggs.
I started to count ’em. I got as far as
147, then took the rest as read. They
were all there, and I made a hasty calcu-
lation that that turtle was going to live
for 3000 years.

“L.A.S.”: Everything grows to Show
size in Queensland, but a centipede killed
in a Rockhampton home the other night
ought to be recorded. It was a foot long
and two inches wide, and was having a
late supper off a freshly-killed mouse
when its luck changed.
* * * *
“John Dory”: Little wonder that platy-
puses caught in fish-traps in the Cudge-
gong River (B. 25/4/’34) were dead when
brought to the surface. The platypus
can live below water for about five
minutes only; if kept submerged for six
minutes it will drown. It swims to the
bottom in search of food —shrimps,
mussels, worms and insect larvae —which
it gathers by nuzzling in the mud, and
stores in its cheek pouches. When these
are full it swims to the surface, and the
food is depouched and masticated. The
platypus is a prodigious eater ; when kept
in captivity specimens have been known
to eat half their own body weight of
food every night. Fish-traps are a great
menace. The animal is rarely seen on
account of its extreme shyness, but is
still plentiful throughout its habitat from
North Queensland to Tasmania. The
flesh is positively distasteful, and was
despised even by hungry abos.
“Yarragundry”: Platypuses? The head-
waters of the Murray and the ’Bidgee teem
with them. Every winter and spring I
used to get five or six dead in my drum-
nets, always in fast-running water. In
the late spring they can be seen play-
ing about in the afternoon. If the
prohibition on ’possum-killing were as
rigidly enforced as the protection of
platypuses cyaniding would be a lost art.
As it is, up-to-date cyaniders are packing
’possum-skins in brine in kerosene-tins,
then soldering the tins up, and consigning
them to illicit buyers.
BILL’S PHILOSOPHY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“They’re always arguing about our local
wines,” said Bill the Bite,
“And whether using names that other chaps
have given them is right.
That real port can only come from Portugal
is far from clear,
But what’s it matter, anyhow, to chaps like
we are?. Mine’s a beer.
“It’s not the label pasted on a thing that makes
it good or ill.
A rose by any other name, it’s known, would
smell as sweet,” said Bill.
“It’s not the letters on the cask that sell what’s
in it, never fear!
The vital point is how it tastes, that’s all that
matters. Mine’s a beer.
“Those Samian and Falernian wines that
Greeks and Romans used to swill,
D’you think they, groused if other nations tried
to copy them?” said Bill.
“D’you think they argued over names or wanted
trade-marks to appear,
So long’s the tipple hit the spot? Not much,
I’ll wager. Mine’s a beer.
“I got no prejudice,” said Bill, and rapped his
pipe upon the wood;
“I only ask the stuff I sink is reasonably cheap
and good.
I give my country pref’rence, but I wouldn’t
drink what’s bad and dear,
Not though you called it Hippocrene or
sparkling nectar. Mine’s a beer.”

“Some o’ them city cooks get

very perlitely I asks him: ‘What
sort of a hand are yer at makin’
brownies?’ ‘So that’s yer game,’
he said. ‘Well, I’m a cook, not a
coiner’; an’ away he goes.”


“J.G.K.”: The par. about Port Phillip
Bay being a grand swamp (B. 4/4/’34)
reminds me of, a' trip I made to the
Grampians (Vic.) with a chap who had
never previously been away from the
Wimmera, where the land is on the
draught-board pattern, a paddock of crop
adjoining one of fallow. We climbed
to Mount Victory lookout and surveyed
the glorious panorama. My pal was
struck with the beauty of the scene, and
it was some time before he spoke. At
length he said: “Marvellous, isn’t it? It
takes up a terrible lot of country,
though.”

so we mixed some to a stiff dough.

throw in, so we pulled over to another
spot, and found jewfish and flathead as
eager for it. We ended the day with
a boatload of mullet, jewfish and flat-
head ; we had thrown many catfish back.
Did the other fish smell the bait or did
the mullet broadcast the news?

“Eggsact”: Three years ago the Bourke
(or Bourke’s) parrakeet might have been
“Steam-roller broken down, what?”
“Rats! This is Rogilla, see, and we’re waitin’ for the vet.”
regarded as “one of our most elusive
birds” (B. 18/4/’34); in those days
when an occasional pair did reach a city
they were jumped at at £l5. Nowadays
they can be bought for as many shillings.
The night parrot ( Geopsitaccus occiden-
talis), however, continues to hide itself
from human ken, and is always referred
to either as the elusive parrot or mystery
bird. Just now news comes that ex-
perienced bushmen have recently seen
the very rare species in the far north
of S. Aus., and again about 100 miles
n.-w. of Oodnadatta. For years systema-
tic searches had been made for this will-
o’-the-wisp without success. In 1867 a
night parrot (all reports yet received are
noticeably in the singular) was captured
in the Gawler Ranges, west of Spencer
Gulf, and presented to the London Zoo ;
but it soon died of cold. Another was
seen in 1915 about Cooper’s Creek. Abo-
riginals dub these birds “Myrrlumbing,”
the sounding of which resembles their
harsh, loud, whistling double-note. All
that was seen of the last officially re-
corded specimen was its feathers. An
ornithologist got the tip that some abos.
at Palm Valley (near the Alice) had
captured one, but was too late to pre-
vent its destruction.
* * * *
“Bogaduck”: There’s no need to
trouble about toheroa soup (B. 18/4/’34)
if you live anywhere near our southern
coasts and can get in touch with a fisher-
man. Tell him that you’d like a few
dozen scallops next time he tongs up
some shellfish for bait, and use the white
meat of these to make soup after the
oyster recipe; then you won’t bother
about toheroas. If you get more than
you need at the one time, put the shellfish
into a bucket and hang it in the sea, but
tie a bit of netting over the top. Netting
must be used ; if not caged your soup
material will swim away as soon as your
back is turned.
* * * *
“Bundalinga”: The new Tallowa bird
sanctuary recently gazetted—it lies
between Bundanoon and Goulburn —is
rich in flora and fauna. Here the bell-,
lyre- and bower-birds may be heard and
often seen. Animals include kangaroos
and wallabies of several species, wom-
bats, dingoes and several others, while
hundreds of caves are to be found where
Binghi camped and made his cave-draw-
ings. The gazettal of the reserve is the
result of years of persistent agitation,
and the area should prove of immense
value to the nature student and anthro-
pologist, while holding many attractions
for the ordinary tourist. Tallowa is 35
miles from Goulburn.
* * * *
“L.8.C.”: Leaving Snake Gully, the
site of the Bunker’s Hill (Q.) rush, after
a few days’ unsuccessful prospecting, I
heard a terrific din. A goanna, about
40 feet up a blue-gum, was being attacked
by two kingfishers. As their beaks rapped
on hi? back he would snap savagely at
them. My first shot caused him to drop
into a fork, and then the birds had an
open go. Two kookaburras in a neigh-
boring tree had been neutral, but not
silent, spectators. When I knocked the
crawler out of the fork with the next
shot, the old reprobates sat there and
laughed heartily. None of the principals
had taken the slightest notice of me
during the scrap.
* * * *
“Prof. Watt-Shores”: In Cockatoo
Lake, near Naracoorte (S.A.), lives a
truly wonderful fish —the hammer-nosed
mullet (Percussiata slippericus). It feeds
solely upon the fresh-water mussel.
It first gathers them in heaps on
some convenient stone, then bends its
body into a hammerlike shape, winds its
tail around a subaqueous tree root, and
with rapid blows from its nose cracks
the shells. Having fed, the mullet,
which are the only fish known to
regurgitate, swim to a log, lay their
noses upon it in a row, and, taking time
from the right, commence to chew their
cuds. That is the only time they
can be caught, for when they close
their mouths their eyes shut also. The
experienced mullet-hunter takes advan-
tage of this fact and sneaks slowly down
upon the line of champing jaws, moving
only an inch at a time and keeping time
with the movements of the fishes’ eyes
and jaws till he is standing right over
them. Then a swift snatch is made with
both hands just as the eyes and jaws
beneath are in the act of closing, and a
couple of fine fish are the prize.
* * * *
“John Dory”: Most animals are secre-
tive about their love affairs, but the
prawns on the coast of N.S.W. are par-
ticularly elusive. Prawn fishermen tell
“C’mon, girlie, an’ I’ll teach you how to milk cows.”
“ You’ll do nothing of the kind. I’m afraid of cows. But if you have a nice
little calf”
you they spawn in lakes and rivers;
but evidence favors the theory that
they spawn in outside waters. It is
very rare to find a prawn with a well-
developed roe. For about ten nights after
full moon, before the moon rises, they
make for the sea in great shoals. Adult
prawns are never seen returning to the
and lakes, but two reliable fisher-
men told me they have seen the very
young prawns working upstream after
coming in from the sea. Any member
of the Council ever witnessed this? If so,
at what time of the year?
* * * *
“Matilda”: I never advocated using
a waterbag as a punching-ball, as
“Tumoulin” asserts (B. 11/4/’34). I
know as well as he does that a waterbag
should never be placed on the ground.
Anyway, “Tumoulin” started the fool-
ishness by balancing his bag on the
point of a needle and on the edge of a
razor. As a peace-offering I would like
to assure “Tumoulin” that, if ever I meet
him on a dry track, I’ll let him provide
the bottle and I’ll supply the chasers out
of my bag.
* * * *
“Arachne”: “Pollywoggle’s” recipe (B.
2/5/’34) for catching mosquitoes—by
letting them present their bills and then
drawing in your breath —is as old as the
hills, and has the additional disadvantage
that you are stung just the same as if
you were dealing with the income-tax
people. My recipe is to encourage
spiders about the house, especially the
gentlemen who build the circular “geo-
metrical” web. My front verandah and
garden support several of these webs,
which are never molested. On early
summer mornings I have counted up to
a hundred mosquitoes in each of them,
with the result that, though there is con-
stantly stagnant water on some park
land not far from the house, mosquitoes
have never been a nuisance.
* * * *
“Jack’s Track”: The red-backed
spider, besides carrying a poison bag,
must have second sight. In shifting a
piece of wire-netting, I shook one off
three eggs and lost her in the long grass.
Making quite sure she was not aboard,
I carried the netting a quarter of a mile
on my shoulder without disturbing the
eggs. Next morning I found Red-back
sprawled over them as if nothing had
happened. Wondering if, after all, I had
carried her on my shoulder, I carefully
dislodged her again, and shifted the net-
ting a further quarter-mile. Morning
found the mother in possession again,
Was she connected with the netting by
a long strand of web all the time?
* * * *
“Mulyan”: Parts of Western Queens-
land specialise in mud houses, some of
them made of huge sun-dried bricks com-
pounded of mud and grass ; others of the
same mixture filled into frames like con-
crete. Some station homes I saw near
the western border had stood almost un-
damaged by sun and rain from the
earliest settlement. They are cool dwell-
ings, but the chief reason for such build-
ings is the cost of suitable timber. They
are copies of the adobe and pise houses
of Mexico, California and South America,
except that the roofs may be covered with
iron (outbuildings thatched with cane-
grass). In the roaring days of the gold-
fields, ’dobe shacks were common enough
in Victoria, the idea having been brought
by diggers from California.
* * * *
“Bourrawei”: Apropos “Flip-feather's”
emus (B. 4/4/’34) that settled themselves
on the mud from which they could reach
water for a drink, when water gives out
or becomes so low that approach is dif-
ficult I have often known these birds to
dig soaks in the sandy beds of rivers and
creeks. Emus will sink as deep as four
feet. Other thirsty bush denizens that
will dig about the same depth are 'roos
and dingoes. Even cockatoos will make
a soak of two feet. But brumbies beat
them all. I have known them to sink
seven and eight feet in search of water,
shifting the heavy sand in quicker time
than a gang of relief workers. Instinct
invariably guides birds and animals of
the bush to spots where such water may
be found.
* * * *
“Pick”: Clinging dejectedly to a log
that the floodwaters of the Cambalong
brought by our fencers’ camp at Gun-
ningrah (N.S.W.) was a ’possum. Evi-
dently the voyager had journeyed far
from the forest country eastward. Below
our camp a river-bend whirlpool bridged
by swirling masses of debris gave the
furry sailor a chance to go ashore from
his tumbling craft. He painfully dragged
himself to land, and sheltered in a cranny
of the rocks. On the miles-wide plain,
far from his gum-tree provisions, we
reckoned he’d starve; but as soon as
his clothing had dried he came out to
sample the harsh leaves of a precipice
shrub. He tried the sprouts of the cab-
bage thistles next and fussed about among
the water-weeds. Half an hour after
dark he had looted our sugar-tin, and
before morning had made away with
most of our flapjacks.
ON THE KERB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Other towns have points about them, but they
have their drawbacks, too;
It’s not everywhere they’ll let you do the
things you want to do;
And it strikes me pretty often that Kalgoorlie’s
hard to beat,
When I’m sitting with a cobber on the kerb in
Hannan-street.
They’re a thoughtful lot of people, and they’re
sociable with it;
Just to strike a place like this it bucks a
fellow up a bit.
They have made a nice wide gutter where a
man can park his feet
When he’s yarning with a cobber on the kerb
in Hannan-street.
There’s the sunny side for winter; there’s the
shady when it’s hot;
And no fussy cove will ask if any business
there you’ve got.
You can get a “How’s she going?” from the
John Hop on his beat,
When you're sitting with a cobber on the kerb
in Hannan-street.
There is small truth in the story that the
streets are paved with gold,
But there’s something worth the finding; and
as long as yarns are told
You may find that precious something helps
your day seem more complete
When you’re sitting with a cobber on the kerb
in Hannan-street.
When you go on shift no longer, when no
more at three o’clock
You are there to catch the tram that’s leaving
for the Boulder Block,
There’ll mayhap be old friends waiting, as
you amble past St. Pete,
Cobbers whom of old you sat with on the
kerb in Hannan-street.

sation in the Great Smoke as “The Bar-

At Adelaide Royal “Ten Minutes'
Alibi” is having a first-in-Australia run.
It is the story of a nice clean murder
without any mystery ; or call it a private
execution, the murdered man deserving
all he gets. He is a white-slaver, and is
about to take one more girl abroad when
her old friend Colin steps in. He can be
bought off for £l5OO, but Colin can’t
raise it. Death is the only remedy. In
Act I Colin dreams the perfect crime;
in Act II he commits it; in Act 111 he
stands a heavy cross-examination by the
police. They get very close to his actual
trick of moving the clock back and then
on ; but the alibi seems watertight, and he
goes free, to the great relief of girl and
audience. The story could be punctured
in a dozen places on analysis; but who
wants to puncture it? It has gripped
London for a year, and may do the same
here.
Anthony Armstrong has told all this
very seriously, the only laughs for two
acts coming in where the actuality natur-
ally differs from the dream. The acting
is remarkable. George Thirlwell, from
London, walks through the tense scenes
without ever raising his voice. One can
imagine it played quite differently, but
he is immensely effective. Arundel Nixon
(whom Sydney Con. used to know) is
equally natural, and almost lovable, as
the villain. Young Thelma Scott comes
well through a trying part, first trustful
and then tearful; and minor parts are in
the hands of Guy Hastings, Chapman
and Atholwood, junior. The third act
is all Frank Bradley’s: a police inspector,
shrewd, kindly, uneducated.
V
“Cauboy”: Beecham’s recent outburst
at Covent Garden, when he told a dis-
tinguished audience to “shut up,” was
gratifying, if inelegant. Alfred Hill, in
my experience, is the only local con-
ductor who has shown indignation when
his art has been disrespectfully treated.
At a concert in Melbourne Auditorium he !
conducted a new symphony, after which
there was polite handclapping. When he
conducted that popular trifle “Waiata
Poi,” however, there were frantic demands
for an encore. Hill returned to the ros-
trum, turned to the house and shouted,
“The people always love the rubbish.”
Then, half-way through the encore, he
threw down his baton and stalked off the
platform, leaving the audience thunder-
struck and the orchestra bewildered.
There is only one valid objection to his
action —he is the author of both pieces.
The Palette.
Harold Herbert hangs a pleasant col-
lection of pictures at the Macquarie
Galleries, Sydney. Almost any of them
would grace a drawing-room ; the general
tone is good, and the color pleasing and
restrained, except where body-color is
used in the foregrounds. “The Ski-run,”
which relies almost entirely on the use of
body-color for its effect of snow, is
marred in this way. That Mr. Herbert
can handle a clean and luminous wash
is shown in the “River Mouth,” a deli-
cious expanse of coastline washed with
silvery-blue water and fading into soft
distances. In the foreground, warm roofs
browse among a huddle of trees. “Church
at Canberra” and “Kitchen Garden” also
impress the eye.
Maud Sherwood, whose water-colors
have been decorations at the Fine Arts,
Melbourne, is primarily an illustrator.
Sometimes, as in “Sunlight at Tunis,” she
conveys the illusion of light and shadow,
but for the most part she has not that
control over her medium which will give
the texture of things as they appear to
the eye, before the mind has identified
them as human beings, trees and houses.
Hence, one looks in her drawings, not
for artistic qualities, but for informa-
tion about Moorish dress, French archi-
tecture and Venetian customs. This in-
formation the lady gives in plenty, for
she is a careful and skilled draughts-
woman, and it is all interesting. But
one would have to take a trip to the
places she has visited to really know what
they look like.
The Victorian Artists’ Society’s
autumnal exhibition opened on May Day,
but General Blarney had no cause to
detail any special constables off to sup-
press revolutionary demonstrations, out-
bursts of hate against the established
order or dangerous tendencies towards
Radicalism. An exception is W. Dargie,
whose portraits “of a Man” and of him-
self have a freshness and vitality which
seem as incongruous in their present
situation as a flapper in a home for re-
tired gentlewomen. The self-portrait,
especially, depicts so impressively the
calm concentration of the young painter
that one seems to be in his presence.
General Blarney, on the other hand, in
Granville Dunstan’s presentation, doesn’t
look as if he would say boo to a Com-
munist, and is, moreover, as flat as the
world in Mercator’s projection. “Mrs.
Norman Brookes,” by the same artist,
partakes of the character of a magazine
cover. E. Buckmaster has given the Frank
Clarke nothing but paint to breathe,
and the flesh of his model appears to be
made of the same material as the rocks
in his adjacent landscape, “The Head-
land.” . J. V. Govett’s “Miss Marjorie
Roulston” has a liveliness about her
which Harry E. Hudson’s “Espanola”
hasn’t. The latter helps himself to Laura
Knight’s formula, and Chas. Hill follows
the late J. J. Hilder in a series of water-
color sketches. The orthodox landscape
school, exemplified by such prosaic
efforts as Dora Wilson’s “Government
House, Adelaide,” is widely represented,
but the impression of monotony is con-
siderably relieved by J. C. Aisbett, Aileen
Dent, E. R. Jones and Marjorie Me-
Chesney, all of whom have obviously
been more interested in the scenes before
them than in academic conventions. After
having been disturbed without being
astonished by the other still life, the eye
rests gratefully on Dorothy Whitehead s
Rhododendrons. Paul Montford has
two busts—one of “Percy Cook” and
another of “Leander.” The former has
a cartoon quality about it, but the other,
a replica of a handsome young man,
carries conviction. Reuter L. Hall’s
“The Warrior” appears to have been
studied under the microscope.
The autumn show of Adelaide Society
of Arts is scarcely up to standard, the
hanging committee having been a bit
lenient. Still, there is good work. Adel-
aide Art Gallery has bought a big Waden
riverscape, and the society’s prizes go to
Jessamine Buxton and- George Whinnen
for flower-pieces. Whinfien shows also
a good .picnic (of about 1850), and
Wilkie’s portraits are always sound.
Boxall, Ragless and Violet Buttrose also
score.

PRINCE SOMEONE’S ADVANCE
AGENT SENDS HIS IMPRESSIONS
TO THE FIFTH EQUERRY.
VI. — Launcobart.
The Prince will like both parts of this
town, but he’d better not praise either
part of it while in the other. It is situ-
ated on two rivers, the Derwent and the
Tamar, and the northern and southern
“How would you like your coffee, sir?”
“Brass handles and no flowers."
parts are separated by a large park. It
will be safe to praise the park. It is
called Tattsmania. As he makes his
triumphal progress across it, the Lyons
family will probably line the route.
His Highness must see the town gaol,
It is near the southern end of the town,
but the last prisoner died some years
ago. Many books have been written
about this character, and the Prince had
better say he has read them all. In
that case he’ll probably escape with a
hurried look at Port Arthur, the triangles,
leg chains and Gabbett’s tooth, but if
he admits ignorance it’ll take him weeks
to get away.
He will find the citizens very cautious.
They seldom venture far from their
homes after dark for fear they should
fall over the edge. Footballers and
cricketers, being possessed of a degree
of daring above the average, frequently
disappear in this way. Fast bowlers find
themselves handicapped, as there is no
room for the run up to the wicket. That
is why McDonald and Nash migrated
to Victoria.
The local Premier is called George
Adams, and the position is hereditary.
This portion of Australia is very popular,
and subscriptions towards the cost of
government pour in from all over the
Commonwealth. The system of govern-
ment is unique. It is carried on by
means of a series, of round-table con-
ferences called consultations. His High-
ness will probably be asked to preside
at one of these consultations.
” The Prince must not miss Mt. Welling-
ton. The townsfolk are very proud of
it, particularly when there is snow on it.
As far as I can ascertain, they are not
responsible for the snow, but he’d better
praise it nevertheless.
Launcobart is separated from the rest
of Australia by Bass Strait, half a cen-
tury and the Navigation Act. The people
don’t worry much about the first two,
but they’ll probably ask the Prince to
repeal the third. H.R.H. will, of course,
use his own discretion. Jasby.
EVOLUTION IN ART.
Plantagenet Dudde reeled into his attic-
studio, full of bitterness and beer. He
wqs becoming desperate. Six months
since he had sold a picture! Even
an artist couldn’t 'go on like that in-
definitely. Lurching over to his latest
masterpiece, he gazed strangely at it, then
with a bitter, bibu-
lous laugh he
seized a brush,
dipped it into the
colors with reck-
less abandon and
dashed it furiously
across the canvas.
Two minutes later
the picture was
ruined. The sub-
ject had disappear-
ed under an . aval-
anche of daubs,
diagonals, rivulets
and blobs.
“T hat is the
end,” cried Planta-
genet as he hurled
the brush from
him and stumbled
to the sofa.
Next morning an
artist friend came
in and looked at
the striking effect
with;a. puzzled ex-
pression. Anon he
brought more art-
ists, and together
they studied the
canvas, all ex-
tremely puzzled at the strange symbol-
ism. Then they awakened, the snoring
Plantagenet and showered their congratu-
lations upon him.
And that’s how Plantagenet Dudde, the
eminent ultra-modernist, founded the
Dudde School of Vorticist-post-Symbolic

THE SPRINTER.
He started to run as he breasted the
crown of the hill, a quarter of a mile
from the tram. With coat flying out on
both sides of him and his hat grasped in
one hand while he hung on to his
attache case with the other, he tore down
the hill at breakneck speed.
The catch of his case flew open
and the contents were strewn on the
roadway. Franti-
cally he gathered
them up, dashing
down the hill after
a couple of rolling
oranges. Just as
he was about to
snap the catch
again his hat,
which he had
jammed on his
head, was whisked
away by the strong
southerly and
blown uphill again.
Abandoning hi s
case, he sprinted
back to recover his
hat; then, again
picking up his case,
he bolted after the
tram, hat and case
crushed under his
arm.
The pace . was
telling, and near-
ing his goal he
stumbled once or
twice, but with a
final, desperate
spurt he reached
the tram and
almost fell into it
in the last stages of
exhaustion. Hi s
face a bright
purple, his breath
coming in wheez-
ing gas p s, he
mopped his streaming brow, dived his
hand into his pocket and glanced grate-
fully at the conductor.
“Thanks.... old man didn’t
think 1’d.... do it.... one right in
....please.”
“Give a bloke a chance,” said the
conductor ; “we don’t leave for another
four minutes.”

EUREKA!
Biffer was a normal, rational being
till the wonder-day dawned.
It changed everything. He was never
at home. Whenever he had a spare
moment he would creep off, carrying
tokens of his love. More and more in-
fatuated did he . become. He was not
content with boring his fellow-clerks.
Strangers in trams and ’buses had to
listen to his varying successes and
failures.
It cost him money, too. He found that
the road to his chosen goal was by no
means easy. A series of setbacks found
him sad and dispirited. Then at last
his luck seemed to turn, and he shouted
drinks for everyone.
After that his love was kinder to him.
Then came the great day. Biffer was
triumphant. And no wonder! He had
won a “B” grade game—4 up and 3 to
play.

interrupting me in my honest occupation
of road-sweeping. '
“Well,” 1 replied, “1 reckon he d be
getting the old-age pension.”
The reporter laughed with a cackling
sound. “Gosh, that’s good enough for
print,” he said.
“What is?”
“Your answer. You see I have been
sent out by the editor to ask all types
of people this question, and the best
answers will be published.”
I dropped my broom and decided to
accompany him —it sounded interesting.
A businessman grunted, “If Adam were
still alive he’d be acting in the talkies.”
“I canna find ma thimble, Jock. Do ye ken where it is?”
“Aye. Ye’ll find it by the whusky bottle. I gae McTavish
a nichtcap.”
A most unintelligent reply, but then
he was a businessman.
We next met a flapper. “If old Ad.
was still breathin’ fresh air,” she said
through her lip-salve, “I s’pose he’d be
pickin’ apples in Tasmania with Eve.”
The reporter needed only one more
answer, so he went up and tapped
the sun-dried stranger on the shoulder.
“If Adam were still alive what d’you
think he would be doing now?” he
asked cheerily.
The bushman took a deep draw of
his cherrywood. “Cripes,” he replied
slowly ; “I didn’t know he was dead !”

right; but the Beach Purity League made
such a fuss that she’s been afraid to
venture out since.

When first we met I did not dream

To gratify her least desire.

Me arrogantly of my pelf,
Some crafty tricks my brain conceives
To raise a bob to spend myself!

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Duke Caledon (Caledon —Coinage), a
big’chestnut owned and trained by W. A.
Dunn, is being hailed as a Derby hope.
His victory in the second division of the
Nursery Handicap at Warwick Farm was
the effort of a good colt. He was backed
from threes to twos, and Jim Munro,
recently returned from the land of curry
and rice, was given the mount —brother
Darby is under suspension. Duke Cale-
don hopped out smartly, dropped back
in the first furlong, came fast at the
turn and, going round his field, had the
race won at the Leger. Alftruda, a nice
Brazen filly carrying the Kelso colors,
was a fair second, and Ruffian, who got
into a lot of trouble early, did well to
get third.
Gay Lass (6 to 1) annexed the other
division from Bonnie Rion and Rossin-
ver. At the Leger Bonnie Rion took
charge, only to be outstayed by Gay
Lass over the last furlong. Both are good
fillies; Bonnie Rion perhaps lost the
race at barrier rise.
Though Juliet Glass had run second
to Journal over ten furlongs at Moore-
field, she was allowed to go out at tens
for the Farm Novice. Ridden excellently
by an apprentice, Eastburn, she worried
Broccoli out of the big end of the prize,

with Silver Foam in third position.
Diamond and Aripiles were the popular
fancies ;*Diamond was fourth, and Ari-
piles finished down the straight.
Blixten (5 to 1) surprised most backers
by_ beating the sprinters in the Denham
Court Handicap. The bookies held him
safe ; the best price laid was sixes—in a
field of eight. Veilantif and Legislator
were favorites. Veilantif essayed to win
all the way, but Blixten, putting in a long
run from the half-mile, dashed away at
the furlong pole, to beat her easily, Tom
Pinch being a poor third and Legislator
last. Anchor (fourth) showed a lot of
pace to the turn.
Last at Rosehill, Bill Wedgewood (14
to 1) was first in the Warwick Handicap.
Galloping freely for Dave Lightfoot, the
little fellow took charge turning for
home and won comfortably from
Forestry, who will be all the better for
the outing; Le Legion was third and
Journal fourth. Bill Wedgewood has
always shown a liking for the Warwick
track and for making his run at the
turn —all his victories on the course have
been gained in that fashion.
Queen Avis (Magpie—Queen Ingoda)
gave the pencillers a skinner in the
Maiden Three- and Four-Year-Old—the
nominal price was 20 to 1. There was a
spectacular plunge on Helensbrook, a
stable-mate of Blixten, who ran third
in the Oaks. She was wide out most of
the way and knocked up in the run
home ; but she can gallop.
Earlminster closed the proceedings by
taking the Edensor Park Handicap at
sevens. He got a lucky run at the turn.
Upoko Ariki was second and Mountain
View—looking well again—third.
* * * *
“Paddy” Einsiedel, the Gippsland
cattle-dealer, has proved a shrewd buyer
of thoroughbred yearlings, which are
leased to various trainers. He acquired
13 at the autumn sales in Mel-
bourne and Sydney; if they turn out
as well as last year’s batch Einsiedel will
have reason for congratulation. Three of
his two-year-olds, Nutcracker, Barracker
and Fanlight, are very much in the lime-
light just now. Fanlight, leased by W. H.
Davidson, romped home in the Juvenile
Handicap at Ascot. Her last four starts
have yielded a third, a second and two
firsts. All that Einsiedel paid for Fan-
light was 55gns.; bred by Dr. A. E. Syme,
she is by Drake from Bright Comedy.
W. J. Smart, who settled in Brisbane
after surrendering the jockey’s license
that he held from the V.R.C., returned
to Melbourne a few months ago
with a couple of horses. Smart married
a daughter of.W. H. Morton, the Flem-
ington trainer, and the main object of
his present trip was to visit relatives, but
stakes won on Vic. courses have more
than covered expenses. Phenomenon
(Brazen —Logic) is a sprinter above the
ordinary. He was sent out nearly as good
a favorite as Septima for the Ascot Five
Hundred. Fourth Battery beat the bar-
rier and, starting from the extreme out-
side, set up a lead of several lengths
before two furlongs had been traversed.
Phenomenon kept within striking dis-
tance, however, and finished too strongly
for Fourth Battery, whom he defeated
by half a length in the excellent time (at
Ascot) of lmin. 6fsec. for 5| furlongs.
The best that Skidmore could do on
Saturday was to finish third in the
Juvenile Handicap on Lord Russell and
third in the Welter Handicap on Gallant
Welkin; so that followers of the crack
Vic. lightweight had an unprofitable
time. Riding honors were well distri-
buted, Brown, Breasley, Bailey, Cann,
Powell, Grierson and Moran each regis-
tering a win, while the mounts of Wilson
and Dewhurst in the River Handicap
(for ponies 14.2 and under) dead-heated
for first place. Wilson rode Bondi Mary,
whose record is five wins, a third and
a dead-heat at Ascot since her arrival
from Sydney. She is owned and trained
by Roach, who won the Five Hundred
on April 28 with Belle Marie. As in the
case of Lou Robertson, D. J. Price and
P. Riddle, the career of Roach as a
trainer began with trotters. A Junee
(N.S.W.) man, he won the Melbourne
Trotting Derby with Lulureen and My
Chum.
There was a mild sensation at Ascot
when two of the V.R.C. stewards went
to the starting point of the first division
of the Encourage Handicap and ordered
H. Hughes to dismount from Tina Pia,
a 50-1 chance. One steward searched
his clothing ; another examined the whip.
Spectators naturally inferred that a bat-
tery was being sought for, but nothing
was discovered. Tina Pia ran fifth in a
field of 15.
One of the biggest betting plunges at
Ascot was that on Chrysonna in the
second division of the Trial Handicap.
His owner-trainer, T. Pearce, backed the
grey gelding from 5 to 1 down to 2 to 1.
Chrysonna has more stamina than the
majority of the progeny of Chrysolaus.
He finished over the uphill straight with
splendid grit and won handsomely from
Emfred, who was sired by Manfred. The
dam of Chrysonna is Rosanna, by Wal-
lace—Ophir. When she foaled Satur-
day’s winner Rosanna was owned by Bob
Lewis. Subsequently she entered the
stud of E. E. D. Clarke. Though Lewis
is on the way to his 56th birthday, he
talks of resuming riding almost immedi-
ately. He was confined to his home with
an affliction of the eyes for four months,
but has recovered.
* * * *
The Two Thousand Guineas, first of
the season’s classics in England, was won
by Lord Glanely’s colt Colombo, with
Australian “Togo” Johnstone up. Run
over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket,
there were 12 starters, the winner going
out at 7 to 2 on. Before the race he
was quoted at 11 to 8 against for the
Derby, which isn’t run until June 6.
Whether the unbeaten youngster will
maintain his record at Epsom is question-
able. The quarter-mile tuck uphill
before coming to famous Tattenham
Corner'has taken the heart out of many
a Two Thousand winner, and Colombo
has yet to prove that he can keep going
after the mile is passed. Worth noting
also that, in the 125 years of the Two
Thousand’s history, only 26 horses have
taken the double. Johnstone is not the
first Australian to ride a winner home
in this race, Brownie Carslake having
bestridden Tetratema in 1920.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Merv Blandon, whom referee Joe
Wallis regards as the best boxer Aus-
tralia has produced since Les Darcy,
won his return match with Star Frisco
at West Melbourne Stadium. It was a
points decision, and the margin in Blan-
don’s favor was small. Still, Frisco is a
good bantam, and so is Dado, whom
Blandon has twice defeated in Sydney.
* * * *
Haban Singh gave lumps of weight
away to Bill Beth and made him look a
mug at wrestling in their match at Leich-
hardt. With a rabbit-killer and a body-
press Beth scored a fall before the match
had gone two minutes, but afterwards
the American had to travel so fast to
keep with the agile Indian that he was
badly blown at the end of the fourth
round. He began the next with a right
swing to the jaw. This brought a repri-
mand, which he disregarded, and he was
disqualified for flinging another clenched
fist to his foe’s face. Punching also
brought defeat to Walter Browning in
his affair with Tommy Nylan at New-
town. In this more fighting—in which
referee Lurich often took part —than
wrestling was seen.
Woodfull’s Men
Australia was given another easy trot
in its second match of the tour when
Leicester was engaged at home. Though
there had been rain, local skipper Hazel-
rigg was satisfied to bat, and thus gave
O’Reilly a chance he grabbed with both
hands and his teeth. When Leicester was
back in the pavilion for 152, the bald-
headed Sydneyite had 7 for 39 opposite
his name. Fleetwood-Smith took 2 for
40 unconvincingly, and McCabe 1 for 32.
Bradman handled his bowling well,
Woodfull having handed the reins to him
for the match. Shipman, a professional,
top-scored for Leicester with 30, Astill,
a one-time Test hope, getting 30 n. 0., and
Geary, here with Chapman’s team, 20,
in a ninth-wicket stand. At stumps on
Saturday Australia had lost Ponsford (9)
for 61, Bradman (26) and Brown (24)
being the not-outs.

Footbrawl
Good weather and crowds marked the
opening of Victoria’s League season on
Saturday. Some 35,000 were at Albert
Park to see South Melbourne shape up
to Collingwood. Playing almost the
same team that won the pennant last
season, South got into its stride early.
The Magpies were fielding five new
men, and most of these failed against
their experienced opponents. South’s
star forward, Pratt, had the measure of
’Wood’s full-back and was getting goals
galore. After half-time Regan was pitted
against him and he got few more, but the
damage was done. South was superior
in marking and cleaner in handling and
passing, and deserved its win by 127
points to 92. Carlton, through vile kick-
ing, looked like losing to Hawthorn, but
managed to get home in the last quarter
by 128 to 80. Fitzroy downed North
Melbourne by 82 to 71, and Richmond
Tigers put it all over Melbourne, collect-
ing 122 to 81. Essendon and Footscray
ended a close and vigorous struggle with
’Don on top —125 to 114. At Geelong
16,000 paid £346 7s. Id. to see their
favorites down St. Kilda by 109 to 73.
The Saints, with their seven or eight
importations, are at present a mob of
individual stars ; when they get together
they should take some beating.
* * *
Rugby Union games in Sydney on
Saturday were played under wet-ground
conditions, but, as usual, the teams per-
sisted in dry-weather tactics. The shock
of the day was Drummoyne’s success in
drawing 8-8 /each side 2 tries and a
goal) with Manly’s all-star team on the
Villagers’ ground. Manly was 5-0 at
half-time, but had been beaten in the
line-out and scrums. Parramatta, in
spite of losing a couple of men through
injuries, won its third successive game.
Eastern Suburbs being the victims, 14-12.
Northern Suburbs won a tough match
from Western at Concord by 8-0, players
on both sides, meriting the attention of
the stipes at H.Q. Only one man was
sent off, however. Randwick galloped
away from St. George at Coogee, 31 to 6.
In the League games the once-mighty
South Sydney flopped like a whale falling
off the Commonwealth Bank building
when it met St. George at Earl Park, the
Saints prevailing by 31-8 (7 tries and 5
goals by Robinson to 2 tries and
1 goal—all •by Williams). Western
Suburbs, in spite of spasmodic rallies by
Uni., won comfortably at Sydney Sports
Ground by 6 tries (18) to a try and 3
goals (9). Uni. forwards fought hard,
but their backs are a weak lot. At Drum-
moyne Oval Newtown downed Balmain
19-11. North Sydney was badly beaten by
Eastern Suburbs, which won 33-10.
Eastern scored 7 tries (Beaton 2), while
Brown kicked 6 goals. North notched a
pair of tries, Dietz converting both.
(Continued on next page.)
Racquet and Bawl
The finals of the Bournemouth hard-
courts tournament were mingled joy
and sorrow for the Australian bar-
rackers. Crawford and McGrath took
the doubles from their Davis Cup mates,
Quist and Turnbull, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3,
but in the singles final Crawford again
went down to Perry in straight sets, 8-6,
7-5, 6-1. This is Perry’s fifth win in the
seven times the pair have met.
(Continued on page 26.)
N.S.W. had little trouble in retaining
the King’s Cup in the Hobart race on
Saturday, winning by four lengths in
19min. 38sec. for the three miles.
Westralia, Queensland and Tasmania fol-
lowed in that order. After the two-mile
mark, Victoria and South Australia
swamped and dropped out. Ma also
kept the sculling championship, H. J.
Turner, of Haberfield, easily retaining
his title. The N.S.W. crew, stroked by
H. D. Ralfan, owed its win to superior
watermanship and a bit of luck in draw-
ing the most sheltered possie. Though
the start of the race had been moved a
mile up the Derwent, very rough water
was experienced lower down the river, as
in 1927.

Woodfull’s Men
Woodfull’s second team in England
began as happily as his first by taking
an innings win from Worcestershire,
with 297 runs to spare. The weather
had cleared up, and there was nothing
much wrong with the wicket, but the
county, which has two Test-match bats-
men in Walters and Pataudi, with sev-
eral others of good performance, could
only manage 112 and 95 in its two
knocks. In the first innings Walters
topped with 32 before Old Man Grim-
mett kidded him with the famous
“straight break,” and the ump. lifted his
hand. In his second try Walters was
caught in the slips off Wall for 5. “Pats
contributions were 14 r.o. in the first
and 27, l.b.w. Grimmett, in the second.
Martin reached 20 in the second spell,
and went to O’Reilly. The Australian
bowling for the match saw Grimmett
head the list with 10 for 80—5 wickets in
each innings—O’Reilly securing 5 for
60. Wall (3-15) and Ebeling also took
wickets. The Australians ran to 504.
Bradman again starred with a charac-
teristic 206 in 210 minutes—3o fewer
runs than in the 1930 match—and then
threw his wicket away. Woodfull did very
well for 48, and Bromley impressed the
English critics with a rattling 45, in
addition to fielding superbly. Oldfield
led the tail-endei's with 67, and Ebeling
(13), Wall (24) and even O’Reilly (25
n. 0.) collected runs. The county bowling
is not rated high class —Howarth, with
4 for 135, got the best figures—but, con-
sidering that the Australians had no prac-
tice to speak of before the match, their
performance was a good one.
* * * *
“Spare Ump.”: Last week the Maryle-
bone club was to have experimented with
a new l.b.w. law, but to time of writing
no news of the trial has leaked out. The
games ticked off were the M.C.C. matches
against Yorkshire and Surrey. The rule
was discussed in Australia last year, and,
by general consent, dismissed as imprac-
ticable, though the much more foolish
“bodyline law” was adopted by the
Board of Control. The English rule says
that if a ball • pitches outside the off
stump and, breaking back, is stopped by
the batsman’s pad, the umpire shall give
the batsman out if he thinks the ball
would have hit the wicket. Some means
of squelching the batsman who habitu-
ally “covers up” is badly called for, but
this idea will’only add to the unhappy
umpire’s already long list of perplexities.
Also, if a breaking ball from the off is
to be treated in this fashion, why not
one coming in from the .leg? Far more
batsmen use the pads to a leg-break than
treat a turn from the off in the same
way.
* * * *
“The Hove”: Maurice Tate, who made
no bones over his disgust at being
omitted from the English team in the
last Australian Tests, has taken on the
role of an Isaiah, and is prophesying woe
to English cricket at the hands of the
Australians. The Sussex pro. thinks
WoodfulPs lot will win on their collec-
tive heads —to use his own phrase, “with-
out an effort.” He also says the batting
from the middle of the list down is far
stronger than that of the 1930 team —an
arguable matter —and holds out great
hopes of O’Reilly.
* X * *
“Ibn el Issar”: Undeterred by its ex-
periences of Jardine, the Indian cricket
board of control has been negotiating
for a visit from Woodfull’s team when
it is on its way back from Britain. Like
the little birdie in the song, India will
have “to wait a little longer.” A visit
of the kind, however short, would mess
up the next Sheffield Shield season, which
is likely to be burdened with an extra
match or two as it is. South Africa and
England both have prior claims, but India
should have a chance somewhere towards
the close of the 1930’5.
One of the most attractive of the many
publications issued in connection with
the Australian Eleven’s tour of England
is “The Don Bradman Souvenir Book-
let.” In addition to full details of the
players and their careers, there are many
valuable records and sketches of past
players and performances, the whole
being excellently illustrated. Attached
to the book is a large and elaborate scor-
ing sheet showing all the matches to be
played and arranged to permit the com-
plete chronicling of play by enthusiasts,
even to individual scores.
Footbrawl
“Fitzcray”: Once the Victorian foot-
ball scouts get their hooks into a likely
player in another State they hang on
like glue, however fierce the opposition.
St. Kilda club, whose missionary to West-
ralia returned empty handed (B. 2/5/’34)
because the Westralians wouldn’t give a
clearance for his captives, has now asked
the Victorian League to wangle the trans-
fers, arguing that if the League could get
the Australian council to work it would
be able to override State decisions, allee-
same the High Court. The council offi-
cials are cold, however, and have re-
plied that the matter is one for the two
warring State bodies and not the whole
of Australia to decide.
* * * *
“Rover”: Australian Rules football in
N.S.W. seems sealed to petty recrimina-
tions. Last week the State League took
the rather extreme case of removing the
chairman of its permit and match com-
mittee from office and appointing a suc-
cessor. The reason published for this is
irregularity in the matter of inter-State
clearances of players. Considering that
this is an annual grievance in every State
following the national code it seems
fussy to take the matter so seriously.
jjc * * *
“Twickenham”: The N.S.W.R.U. has
taken the easiest way out of its difficulty
over that disputed try (B. 2/5/’34) which
a temporarily knocked-out referee gave
in Randwick’s favor against Drum-
moyne. It has decided that the match
must be played again, under one of its
own local competition rules. This is
against all Rugby Union law and equity.
The umpire’s decision should have stood,
right or wrong
* * * *
“Gate”: That suggestion that N.S.W.
Rugby Leaguers should play a third
match against Queensland in Sydney
under electric light (B. 2/ 5 / ’34) is to be
acted on, the Bananalanders welcoming
the prospect of an extra gate. The match
will be played at Sydney Showground,
where there is an elaborate floodlighting
system, on Thursday, June 7. If the
experiment succeeds it is a good bet we
shall see it every season.
* * * *
“Brass Addler”: N.S.W. and Queens-
land Rugby League players who toured
Britain with the Kangaroos are waiting
eagerly for the dawn of that glad day
when their share of the profits, in addi-
tion to their touring pay and allowances,
will be announced. The R.L. heads are
assembled in Brisbane at time of writing,
and their decision may be out before
this appears in print. Writer has it
straight from the shrewdies’ mouths that
the figure will be £2OO per man.

“Py Korry”: Ever since it first took a
hand in the establishment of the profes-
sional League code this side of the Line,
Maoriland has been the lame dog, always
howling insistently to be helped over the
stile by its heftier brethren in Australia.
Of late the lameness has been increasing
in proportion to the fading out of the
howls. A recent appeal to help the cause
along in M.L. fell on deaf ears when
brought before the N.S.W. governing
body. So did a further suggestion that
the inviting of a M.L. team to Australia
might aid —in view of past experiments
in that line the hint did not arouse en-
thusiasm. It is impossible to blame the
League. It has burned its fingers badly
over trying to establish its code in the
greatest R.U. stronghold in the world,
and it also dropped a parcel in trying to
foist the game on the Melburnians, who
would have none of it, though they are
taking kindly enough to the Union.

capping and decided to adhere to the
antiquated scratch-score system. One or
two of the Brisbane clubs, notably Royal
Queensland, were in favor of the change,
and two of the country associations fol-
lowed suit, but the diehards had their
way. However, a new system of scratch-
scoring is to be introduced, and that will
probably make the confusion worse con-
founded.

“Hoylake”: The week-end will see the
Walker Cup match between British and
American amateur golfers. Michael
Scott captains Britain and Francis Ouimet
the American visitors to St. Andrews.
Both sides have strong teams, but the
British have an ugly hoodoo to over-
come —they haven’t won a tourney since
the affair was instituted in 1922.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: The clutching hand
of professionalism has dragged down an-
other amateur golf idol from its pedestal.
This time it is Enid Wilson, unbeatable
in women’s golf since Joyce Wethered—
also recently dubbed a professional—
dropped out. The women who run the
game in Britain have notified Enid that
she will not be allowed to defend her
title of British women’s champion. This
follows on the decision of St. Andrews
that Miss Wilson has been “exploiting
her skill as a golfer” by writing golf for
the press. The lady has retorted that she
is a professional journalist, such being
permitted to do these things, but so far
the R. and A. and the L.G.U. are
adamant.
* * * *
The English amateur golf champion-
ship—not to be confused with the British
—was played at Formby, a Lancashire
seaside course, this year, and provided a
packet of surprises. One of them was
the vanquishing of Michael Scott by
an unknown from Birmingham named
Frazier. Another shock was the knock-
out of Colonel Critchley, amateur cham-
pion of France, by Lucas, an 18-year-old
left-hander, who is cricket and Rugby
captain at Stowe school. Leonard Craw-
ley, a former holder of the title, fought
out the final with S. Lunt, another lad
from Brummagem, who defeated him
after the fight had been carried to the
37th.
* * * *
“John Dory”: Golf balls do some
funny things at times, but this should
take some beating. Playing at North
Brighton (Sydney), I drove a ball on
a flat fairway. Failing to find it on the
grass where it should have finished, I
went back about 20 yards to a dry well,
with vertical walls, about nine feet deep.
I searched the debris at the bottom and
probed with a niblick a drain opening
into its base. There was quite a good
iball there, but it wasn’t mine. At length
I noticed a three-inch drain pipe about
three feet from the bottom on the tee
side of the well, the opening of which
was almost completely concealed by rank
grass. On the off chance, I thrust in the
niblick. My ball was there right enough,
about 18 inches along the pipe.
Racquet and Bawl
“Cash Amateur”: With the arrival of
Crawford in England the rumors that he
and Perry will turn professionals at the
end of the year have sprung up again.
Both have emphatically denied it, and
there the matter rests for the present.
All the same, the tip was slung by the
American journal which last year told
the same story about Vines and Cochet
and proved correct. It says the change-
over will come after the finish of the
American championships at Forest Hills.
* * * *
“Centre Court”: Wimbledon will not
be available for the Australian team’s
opening Davis Cup match after all. The
old Rugby Union ground at Queen’s
Club, now converted into grass tennis
courts, has been suggested, but the proba-
bilities are that Eastbourne will be the
venue, both hard and grass courts being
available there. One point in this seaside
town’s favor is that it will be full of
holiday-makers. Hitherto these prelimin-
ary matches have been consistently
allotted to “bush” centres, with poor gates
in consequence.
* H= * *
“Kooyong”: When the Victorian
L.T.A. lately refused entries from tennis-
players who had taken money for play-
ing football or appearing in other sports,
there was a rumpus. As a result, the
Cabbage Garden tennis heads came out
in the open last week and said they
would class as professionals any players
not eligible to compete as amateurs in
any branch of sport. This is a drastic
change. In many amateur sports of the
highest standing the fact that a man is
a professional in other fields does not de-
bar him from indulging in that particular
“It's simply disgraceful the club expecting you to play on this mud puddle—
why can’t they put relief workers on to concrete it?”
sport if he makes no profit out of it.
The Rugby Union, one of the world’s
most powerful amateur bodies, is a case
in point. So long as you don’t play
football for money or its equivalent or
belong to a recognised professional foot-
ball organisation, you are an amateur in
its eyes.
* Jfc * *
“Blither”: The ingenious gentry who
conduct the press propaganda for the
Yankee Davis Cup team got a shock the
other day. For some time they have
been booming a huge young person named
Stoeffen as legitimate successor to Vines.
The gentleman was dry-nursed by the
American tennis lords and only allowed
to compete in a limited number of
tournaments lest he should grow stale
before starting out to conquer the world.
Figuratively, he was fed on honeydew
and given the milk of paradise in
schooners. Then came the crash. At the
important Virginia State tournament Van
Ryn, whom we rated in Australia as a
decent third-rater, licked the Stoeffen out
of him.
Car and Cycle
“Formula”: For some time past there
have been rumors and conjectures about
the reconditioned Bluebird. Malcolm
Campbell has just released some facts
about the new features. Special stream-
lining has been resorted to, and the wheels
of the redesigned ’bus will be mostly
inside this, Campbell being of the opinion
that unshielded wheels and axles account
for half the head resistance of a racing
car. The most important change has
been the fitting of twin rear wheels to
increase tyre area and the adhesion to the
track of the driving wheels. If the Blue-
bird had been fitted with the twins at
Daytona, Campbell is confident that with
the power his engine developed he would
then have reached his life’s objective of
300 m.p.h. or better, instead of the
272.108 he registered.
* * * *
“Disc Clutch”: That reference to the
Australian chassisless car now being
manufactured in Sydney (B. 25/4/’34)
reminds me that Czecho-Slovakia has just
produced a job almost as much out of
the ordinary. This car is called the
Tatra, and, instead of the usual frame
with side members, has a large, tubular
steel backbone for frame. The engine
is horizontally opposed and air-cooled,
and the whole outfit has given such satis-
faction over the local roads, which are
as rough as the language, that there is
already a big demand for it. The idea
might work well on Australian tracks,
some of which are probably as awful as
anything in Czecho-etc.
* * * *
“Whizz”: Despite his potentiality for
harm, the average car-driver is probably
the most indifferent of all who follow
what is likely at any moment to be a
dangerous pursuit or occupation. Statis-
tics recently prepared by the Automobile
Club of New York from the examina-
tion of many thousands of cars showed
that only 34.5 per cent, were in perfect
condition. Still more disturbing to pedes-
trians, 32.7 per cent, of the remainder
had defective brakes. Faulty headlights
took up 24.8 per cent., and the balance
was made up of less important shortcom-
ings. There is a move in America in
favor of compulsory inspection of cars
at stated intervals, and something of the
sort is urgently called for in Australia.
5(: * * *
“Kick Starter”: Queensland’s motor-
cycle Grand Prix, which hasn’t been
held since 1932, may be run on June 4.
Leading N.S.W. riders have promised
to take part in that event, Don Bain
among them. Getting in the cash neces-
sary to finance the Senior and Junior
races at such short notice is likely to
be the hurdle, but the Queensland
branch of the A.C.U. is to see what can
be done at its meeting on May 13.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: Hopes of attracting a re-
presentative lot of the world’s best push-
bikers to Melbourne centenary are get-
ting a bit dashed. According to a cable
it is doubtful if any of the star Com
iinentals invited will come unless the big
race is made a scratch one. Since it has
been decided to run it as a group handi-
cap to give everyone a chance, that’s
that. Opperman also is a doubtful
starter. He is racing in Europe and is
tied up with contracts. Besides, it is
well known that he agrees with the
Europeans in preferring scratch races to
handicaps.
Miscellaneous
“C. Bumpkin”: If Melbourne Cen-
tenary Committee sticks to its original
conditions, its air race will be flown in
a fog of international blanky. These con-
ditions provided that each machine must
have a certificate of airworthiness from
its parent nation, and must comply with
the conditions thereof during the race.
Shortly after, there were reports of
Yankee preparations and of British fore-
bodings that the alleged superiority of
American machines made the result a
foregone conclusion. Then the rule was
altered to provide that all craft must
conform to the minimum standard of air-
worthiness fixed in the normal inter-
national category. The Yankees say this
rules out their purely racing machines, as
well as the special mail and passenger
’planes of the Lockheed and Northrop
types. The Centenary Committee asserts
it doesn’t, and there the matter stands at
present.
* H* #
“Stretcher” Latest advices from
Canada do not indicate that Bobby
Pearce will be in Australia this year, as
“Shell” avers (B. 2/5/’34). He has
written to say he is signed up for a
series of races during the Canadian Ex-
hibition in September, his fellow-competi-
tors being Goodsell and Barry and,
perhaps, Burns, from N.S.W. Toronto
is also holding its centenary later in the
year, and Robert is down to row in a
big race during that celebration, so the
Melbourne show will evidently have to
get along without the champion.

“Backwoodsman”: Australian bowlers
are to make their bow at the Empire
Games after all. The A.B.C. has noti-
fied State bowling bodies that a rink, a
pair and one singles player will have to
carry the flag. The side will be chosen
from players at present in Australia,
though the fact that well-known bowlers
will be in Britain for the tennis and
cricket may help the selectors when mak-
ing their choice.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
RAM-BUYING TROUBLES.
“Dead Finish”: The stud-breeders of
sheep in N. S. Wales are breeding a
type of ram eminently suitable for our
purposes here in N.-W.Q., but we don’t
seem to be able to get hold of them
unless we go south and buy them on
the spot. This is in many cases out of the
question, chiefly for financial reasons.
It is customary for the grower out here
to send his request for a draft of rams
to the wool-broking firm that holds the
lien over his stock and wool clip and get
that firm to pass the order on to the stud
grower. The rams come along in due
course, and delivery is taken. I have
just inspected a draft forwarded in this
manner, and am amazed at the varied
types—as far as wool goes—in this sup-
posedly straight line of sheep.
It includes everything from a 56’s in
some to what will be a 70’s spinning
count in others after a couple of years in
our country. These sheep come from a
recognised stud, and it makes one wonder
what system of sheep-classing is indulged
in.
From the look of this and other lots
sent up in late years, it would seem that
the classing is principally for conforma-
tion and general appearance. The sheep
under review are certainly a uniform lot
in frame and appearance, but we unfor-
tunates out here have to depend on our
wool clips to get us on speaking terms
with our interest bills, and need some-
thing more in our rams than looks.
If we cannot get a sire with a uniform
type of wool suitable to our require-
ments to transmit to his progeny, we
are going to finish up with a mixed lot
Of flock sheep and so lose ground.
The rams are to be had, but we don’t
get ’em.
DRENCHING ADVICE.
“Egad”: To answer “Spot’s” inquiry
re drenching (B. 11/4/’34). A quarterly
minimum would be quite sufficient,
provided the sheep are not badly
infected. Normally we drench twice in
the early summer, about eight days apart,
then give two single drenches, one in
February and one in the late autumn.
This last helps the sheep on the less nutri-
tious feed available in an average dry
(Q.) winter.
We drench also after big rains, for it
is then that the worms breed up, even
though they rarely trouble the sheep
until the feed begins to dry back.
For the first drench, we give arsenic,
bluestone and Epsom salts, which is effec-
tive for the nodule as well as the stom-
ach worm. For the remainder, we use
carbon tetrachloride, two c.c. of c. tetra-
chloride to three c.c. of paraffin for
grown sheep and one c.c. to four c.c.
respectively for weaners.
Where there is a mineral deficiency
or concentrated foods are in use, this
is not as safe as the bluestone drench,
but it has the advantage that in using it
it is unnecessary to starve the sheep,
though better results are obtained when
they are kept away from water.
The formula for the arsenic and blue-
stone drench is:
Arsenic 2oz.
Epsom salts 61b.
Bluestone 4oz.
Water 5 gals.
And the dose is:
For grown sheep 2 fl. oz.
For weaners, 8-15 months H fl. oz.
From 4-8 months 1 fl. oz.
SELLING THE “SHEEP ANCHOR.”
“Valerin”: If, as is alleged, merino
stud-breeders are up against it, they have
themselves to blame. When wool values
boomed and prices for rams went up,
quality often was sacrificed in an effort
to get mass production. To meet a
demand for reasonably-priced rams of
fair average quality, a crowd of new men
started stud flocks, with the result that
when the slump came there were, and
are still, too many at the game.
The N.S.W. graziers’ conference flatly
turned down a proposal to have the em-
bargo on the export of merino “breeders”
removed. At its top, the export trade
never got beyond the £40,000 p.a. mark —
far too paltry a price to sell our one safe
industry for.
BLOAT SIGNS.
“Beefo”: Cattle being turned on to
succulent pastures when empty are apt
to become bloated. The trouble is
brought about by a collection of gases
that fills the first stomach so as to cause
the walls to become paralysed, preclud-
ing rumination.
Distension of the stomach, a hollow in
the flank on the near side, distressed
breathing, switching the tail, lying down
and getting up again continuously, trans-
ferring the weight from one foot to
another and general uneasiness are all
evidence of bloat troubles. Unless treated
quickly, death is likely.
If a bloat drenching mixture is not on
hand, give the animal a pint of linseed
oil. Aromatic spirits of ammonia in one-
ounce doses, given in a quart of water,
may decompose the gases, but the mis-
take should never be made of giving a
dose of the latter immediately after a
dose of oil, which it saponifies. Turpen-
tine, ginger and cayenne pepper may
serve in mild cases, but usually severe
bloat needs the knife. A trocar and
canula with directions for use can be
purchased, but a bold stab with a sharp
pocket-knife blade will do the trick in
emergency. The place to strike is mid-
way between the last rib and the point
of the hip on the left side, the cut to be
big enough to allow the entrance of a
piece of tubing, gas-piping, a hollow
reed or almost anything which will allow
the gas to escape. With the escape of
the gas, sew up the wound and swab with
an antiseptic.
REDWATER.
“Cockyson”: When an outbreak of
redwater occurs in tick-infested country
it will always be found that the victims
are cattle from clean country or from
paddocks which have been long kept
practically tick-free by regular and fre-
quent dipping. Redwater never strikes
cattle chronically tick-infested from
birth, a fact well known to observant
stock-raisers.
In the writer’s locality, which has been
tick-infested since 1898, the only cases of
redwater during the present century were
among purchases from beyond the tick
boundary, or in animals bred in tick-free
paddocks in the district. Unless cattle
are inoculated fand even this precaution
is not always sure), it is a mistake to
keep stock entirely clean over a long
period, especially, if neighbors are care-
less about dipping. Redwater is likely
to occur when clean animals are mar-
keted by road, especially if much dirty
country has to be passed through.
TELEGONY.
“The Lad”: Many men of breeding
experience believe that it is possible to
cite cases of telegony in their own cattle.
If they were to probe deeper they would
find other causes which would put tele-
gony out of the question. Mendel’s Law
would show them what has really hap-
pened. ♦
It is as impossible for a bull to in-
fluence the future progeny of a cow not
sired by him as it is for a previous crop
of carrots to influence a present crop of
cabbages. From the time of service to
birth it is the duty of the cow to feed
the growing foetus with nourishment
from its own blood. This is the main
starting point in the telegonist’s argu-
ment, for, he asks, is it not possible that
the blood of the cow, circulating through
the foetus, returns to the dam carrying
with it some of the sire’s hereditary fac-
tors, obtained from the foetus, which
remain in the cow’s blood and are passed
on at future services with the hereditary
factors of the dam herself?
Actually the blood of the dam never at
any time circulates through the body of
the foetus, which has its own circulatory
system and gains nourishment by
absorption, not by circulation. Later,
it is nourished through the umbilical cord,
which is attached directly to its organs,
and from the placenta.
Throw-backs are riot the outcome of
previous service, but are due to the in-
fluence of certain ancestors asserting
themselves.
THE RED-GRASS PEST.
“The Chiel”: The menace of red grass
on the Upper Murray and in Riverina
has developed this year, probably because
of an abnormal summer rainfall.
Red grass is a summer-grower and has
only a limited feeding value during the
first month or so of early spring. During
winter it has no fodder value.
In districts where red grass has taken
possession the better types of pasture
plants cannot exist, and stockowners
must anticipate a serious winter feed
shortage.
Red grass can be eradicated by plough-
ing and sowing down suitable types of
pasture grasses. Ploughing, however, is
not always practicable. In such cases the
grass can be eliminated from the pastures
by sowing subterranean clover at the rate
of lib. to 31b. of seed per acre. Seed
should be mixed with super., lcwt. to
l|cwt. per acre, and may be sown with-
out a preliminary burning of the red grass,
although this may be advantageous if
conditions are suitable for a good burn.
The sub.-clover seed should be sown in
March or April, but the sowing can be
extended into May if seasonal conditions
are suitable. In the following season the
sub.-clover area should again be top-
dressed with lcwt. super, per acre in
order to thoroughly establish the sward,
which at the end of the second year
should be fairly dense.
By the fourth or fifth season the sub.-
clover will have complete control and the
red grass will be eliminated from the
pasture. Sub.-clover and super, also build
up the fertility of the soil and enable the
subsequent introduction of high-fertility
grasses like rye.
The control of objectionable grasses of
low feed value is simply a question of
efficient pasture management.
NOXIOUS WEEDS.
“Cumberland”: I’ll back “Riverina
Grazier” (B. 11/4/’34) about the spread
of noxious weeds. In my N.S.W. district
all the councils do is to stick a notice in
the local paper, which everyone ignores.
One of the biggest troubles we have is the
African box thorn, which, flowering eight
months a year, spreads like magic. It
is hard to eradicate and a great soil
robber. Annually I get a new crop from
an alderman’s dirty paddocks. It even
grows right into the town. From using
wheat from dirty country I have counted
no fewer than 13 new varieties of thistles
in my unused fowl pens, while the giant
creeping bindy-eye is another wheat
arrival. Twelve years ago we had only
six noxious weeds in our district; we
now have nearly 28 identified ones, and
they seed and multiply like wildfire. My
fallowed cultivation will be well seeded
with thistle-seed now floating down
from careless farms. I’ve spent on an
average ss. an acre for the last five
years in sprays and men’s wages cleaning
out noxious weeds, while others laugh
at me.
CURLY-LEAF AND FRUIT TREES.
“Mirza”: Despite sprays, my trees
were badly afflicted with curly-leaf, and
began to lose their leaves and just-set
fruit. They had been well dug, manured
with wood ashes, superphosphate and
nitrate of soda, topped with farmyard
manure.
An old identity of the district —noted
for his good orchard —suggested: “Scat-
ter washing-soda round the trees, fork it
in, then water.”
To hasten matters, I dissolved the soda
in water before applying. It worked like
magic. My trees made a good recovery,
ripened the remainder of their crops, and
I have had no trouble since.
SMALLER PASPALUM IS BEST.
“Compressum”: Farmers who once
sang the praises of paspalum are doing
their best to eradicate it.
In some districts it has killed better
pastures, ruined clean cultivation and
even worried councils by its inroads on
to highways and drains. If you want
paspalum, go for compressum, or creep-
ing paspalum, which never becomes a
pest.
It is a grass that will carpet poor, bar-
ren soils in a few years and transform
bare gullies into stock-carrying country.
It can be killed by ploughing—which is
tonic to the dilatatum.
Introduce it in cleared spots among
the bracken and the grass will creep
among the fern and gradually crowd it out.
If the land is then wanted for cultiva-
tion, it can be readily ploughed and will
be found greatly enriched by the matted
leaf matter of fern and grass.
“Jumbuck”: The Bulletin Wool
Card showing samples of nine Bradford
types may not be purchased by all
graziers, but Sample 4 showing a “doggy”
type of inferior merino wool should be
exhibited in every merino shed in Aus-
tralia. Plenty of growers do not know
what a bad type of a merino wool really
is, but with a sample of the rubbish con-
tinuously before their eyes in the shed it
might be the means of thousands of
nondescript ewes growing that type of
wool getting the knife.
“Rich. J.”: It is scarcely ten years
since rice was first commercially grown
in this country. To-day the annual sow-
ing is about 20,000 acres, which satis-
fies our requirements. N. S. Wales
Department of Agriculture has estab-
lished a rice research station in the
middle of the rice belt at Yanco, and
is doing much useful work investigating
such matters as seed selection and water-
ing. The birth of this now-important
industry was all due to the necessity of
utilising the heavy-class soils on the
Irrigation Area which were unfit for
orcharding.
“Bundalinga”: An abnormal sequence
of seasonal changes during the last 12
months has resulted in a great number
of sheep being transferred from Riverina
to districts further north. It is estimated
that the number shifted during the last
three months was two and a half million.
As a result, prices have increased.

‘‘Over 40 ailments are caused
by clogged intestines,” ex-
plains Dr. J. Bruenaur, the
noted European Specialist.
Constipation, ind i g e stion,
stomach troubles, gastritis _ —
rheumatism, neuritis, sciatica
bladder weakness, catarrh,
frequent colds, headaches
lassitude and poor appetite
all these and more can be
caused by the clogging of the
intestines which gives rise to
Self-poisoning ( Auloxima).
NEARLY EVERYONE SUFFERS
Self-poisoning is caused through
incomplete evacuation of the
bowels. Nearly everyone suffers,
even people of regular habits.
Modern foods and lack of exercise
give rise to flabbiness of the ab-
dominal organs which makes com-
plete elimination almost impos-
sible. Fragments of food waste
cling to the intestinal walls and'
there decay, breeding germs and
poisons which enter the blood-
stream. Self-poisoning is all the
more to be dreaded because it is
hidden and often unsuspected. The
symptoms of self-poisoning are
always apparent, however. Skin
blemishes, thos° frequent head-
aches, fits of ‘blues,’ the strange
lassitude and weakness which pre-
vent you from entering fully into
the enjoyment nf life all point to
you being a victim.

“EQUAL TO 15 YEARS OF LIFE*’
“I have been using COLOSEPTIC
for over three years. I have felt
very grateful to it as it effected a
wonderful difference in health and
strength, equal to a recovery of 15
years of life. I became absolutely
free of any physical complaint
whatever. I am 83 years of age and
my health continues perfect and
free from any trouble. I now
find it only expedient to take
COLOSEPTIC occasionally of a
morning.”

COLOSEPTIC BRINGS BACK
HEALTH
Before you can regain the spark-
ling health that is your birthright,
you must sweep away the poison-
ous intestinal accumulations. Drink
COLOSEPTIC in hot water every
morning. Coloseptic first loosens
the fermenting matter encrusted on
the walls of the intestines and then
gently sweeps it right out of the
body. COLOSEPTIC activates the
kidneys, the pores of the skin, and
the respiratory apparatus, thereby
ridding the blood-stream of all
impurities.
DRINK COLOSEPTIC EVERY
MORNING
COLOSEPTIC gives you the in-

NEW-PRINCIPLE REMEDY
RELIEVES SOUR STOMACH
AT ONCE
Be warned of after mealtime pains,
flatulence or heartburn —Nature’s sig-
nal of serious danger. Proof positive
is available to tell sufferers from the
misery of neglected indigestion that
they can, with this wonderful, entirely
new-principle remedy, start on the road
back to health. And how glorious it is
to eat what you like, as much as you
like, knowing that after mealtime pains
will worry you no more.
Here are a few from a host of letters
every indigestion sufferer should read.
Doctor Astonished.
Your powder acted like a charm on
my nervous dyspepsia. My Doctor says
he is astonished with my wonderful
improvement. —No. 74.
Acid Stomach Relieved.
The first dose of your Antacid Powder
relieved the acid and burning-. I can now
sleep at night. I am very glad I tried
De Witt’s Antacid Powder. -N0.83.
Gastric Ulcers.
Some years ago, I had an operation
for gastric ulcers, but soon after was as
bad as ever. I suffered from agonising
wind day and night. De Witt’s Antacid
Powder freed me from awful pain, for
which I am grateful.—Nc. 127.
An Absolutely Different New
Remedy for Week Digestions
The specially chosen ingredients of
this quick-action remedy are three-fold.
Firstly, the special colloidal-kaolin
content soothes and strengthens the
digestive organs. The ultra fineness of
the quality of this kaolin ensures the
absorption of poisonous bacteria in the
bowels, without hindering the working
of these organs in any way.
Secondly, an important ingredient
actually helps to digest your food,
thereby taking an enormous strain from
the weakened stomach and enabling
you to get the full nourishment from
your food.
Thirdly, this remedy builds up within
the body an alkaline resistance so that
acidity, that leads to burning, griping
pains and ulceration, is neutralised to
free you from such pain and danger as
gastritis, colitis or chronic bowel weak-
ness. Don’t suffer indigestion misery
longer. Go to your chemist now. Ask
for and see you get—

HINTS FOR THE FARM
“M. 8.”: A good way to get rid of
white ants is to mix a teaspoon of caus-
tic soda and one level dessertspoon of
arsenic with half a kerosene-tin of
molasses. In the mixture soak some
sticks of pine and bury them beside the
infested spot. The white ants will soon
discover the molasses, and the conse-
quences will be fatal.
“E.F.8.”: The greatest wear on jinker
harness occurs where the faces of the
buckles press on the leather. Short pieces
of thin leather, with a hole to take
tongue of buckle, inserted between the
buckle-faces and the strapping of har-
ness, prevent friction and corrosive action
damaging the harness. This adds years
to the life of the tackle.
“Boka”: A serviceable cow rug can be
made from four cornsacks and a few
old buckles and straps. Sew three of the
sacks together down the long side* and
one flat across the top in the centre.
Pttt the rug on Strawberry with the sack
sewn on the end over her neck, fasten
tm\ underneath with a strap, and a strap
from the four corners round each leg
CQfl’fdetes the rug.
; “fpangaratta”: Faults in concrete are
usually due to one of two things—either the
quantity of water or quality of sand. Sand
containing organic impurity is dangerous,
but if a sample that has been shaken up
in a glass with a dilute solution of caustic
soda gives not more than a light yellow
color to the liquid, after standing 24
hours, the sand can be used. The surface
should be kept moist for a few days, as
quick drying means less resistance to
wear.
“E.R.D.”: Simple measures for the
farm. A halfpenny is exactly one inch
in diameter. A sixpence is three-quarters
of ah inch across, and a threepence is
five-eighths of an inch. A penny is just
under an inch and a quarter. A postage
stamp is an inch high, including perfora-
tions.
“H.8.K.”: Now that petrol-tins are
scarce, they can be made to last longer
as water-tins, etc., by painting them inside
and out with hot coal-tar and then sprink-
ling them at once with dry cement. Dry
thoroughly, and repeat the treatment. I
have had one in use for 2\ years.
“Kariah”: When resetting bolts in a
concrete bed for engine or separator, use
molten sulphur instead of cement. It
will harden within a minute, and is ex-
ceptionally strong. Engineers sometimes
pour it through the engine lugs and do
away with bolts altogether. For re-
setting the handles in knives, molten sul-
phur has the advantage that it will not
melt in hot water.
“Painter”: To touch up the interior
house walls, or give the sulky or farm
plant a freshen-up with paint, you can’t
beat lacquer, which is very economical
and outlasts ordinary paint. Use a small
Rega hand spray (cost about 3s. 6d.), or
for small jobs an insect fumigant spray.
Use one part lacquer to two of thinner,
and spray it on economically. When
finished, wash the spray out with kero-
sene or the nipple will get blocked with
lacquer.
“Te Babarantiko”: Creosote is a front-
rank preservative of fencing-posts, above
as well as below ground. Creosote-im-
pregnation was—probably still is—a
stipulation in supply of sleepers for
Brazilian railways, used under conditions
closely similar to Australian. Where
there is no creosote, try this: Lightly
scorch the portion of the post to be
buried, until the outside is uniformly
charred. Place a stone in the bottom of
the post-hole for the post-end to stand
on. Few chemical methods of stopping
decay can compete with it.
“H.8.K.”: For white ants in house
blocks or posts, bore holes slanting
a bit downwards. Drop in a few small
lumps of carbide, to which add water.
Plug- the hole. For trees attacked, dig
down 15in. near the main roots, plant
pea-sized lumps of carbide, fill in
the earth, and water.
“A. E. Holloway”: The world is all
wrong about eggs, it seems. After all
these years, it has no more sense than to
pack eggs point up. Prolonged experi-
ments have now shown that three times
more breakages are sustained in the ordi-
nary packing than in packing with round
end up. The air cell of an egg is at the
broad end, and if the egg is packed point
up the air tries to rise, and that is apt to
lead to deterioration.
“T.K.D.”: Goannas cannot climb iron
pipes, so nest-boxes can be made secure
from therp by building a stand about 4ft.
high from lengths of old iron water
piping. Drive four lengths into the
ground, set apart to fit the row of boxes.
Then plug the pipe ends with wood, so
that cross pieces can be nailed on to sup-
port the boxes and a perch in front of
them.
“Briny”: “Whitihana’s” way (B.
4/4/’34) to make stubborn ewes mother
lambs may succeed, but the following
method is certain, too: Rub whisky on
the ewe’s nose and some on the lamb’s
tail and stern, and drink the balance
yourself. Let the ewe smell the lamb
before releasing in a small yard. The
result will be found immediately effec-
tive and agreeable to all concerned. It
is an old Hebridean shepherd’s trick.
“W.D.Mc.”: Old motor tubes make
good yard leggings. I was at a sale last
week and saw a cocky wearing a pair,
neatly cut and with a nice roll at the
top. He looked the driest man about the
ring. It was raining heavily at the time,
and the water from his oiler was shed-
ding off his rubber-encased legs as it
would off a duck’s back.
“Yarthorb”: To reset vehicle springs,
heat your spring leaves, and set them up
to desired shape, making sure, of course,
that each succeeding leaf fits the one
above it. Now take any leaf to start
with, and heat it evenly to a_ dull red
all over. At that heat plunge it in cold
water as evenly as possible. Next bring
the degree of hardness to the desired
temper thus: Put the leaf back in the
fire, and work it through from end to
end so as to ensure even heating. The
heat to aim at this time is one that makes
a piece of pine or cedar just nicely smoke
without breaking into flame. At that
heat plunge evenly into cold water. The
results will surprise all not knowing the
method.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) A short life history of the bot-fly ? (2)
Can the flies eat, bite or sting ? (3) Does the
male bite or sting? (4) What application will
effectively keep bots away from a horse ? —1155.
(1) Eggs are laid on the hair of the animal
and do not hatch until they are rubbed or
licked by the horse. The minute spiny maggots
are ready for emergence from the egg in about
seven days, but may lie dormant for several
months. The horse in biting itself completes
the hatching; the young bots are taken into
the mouth and find their way to the stomach,
to the walls of which they attach themselves.
After they are fully grown through feeding in
this position they pass out of the body of
the horse in the manure. They then burrow
into the soil and pupate, and after a period
varying from 20-70 days, depending upon tem-
perature conditions, the perfect fly emerges.
(2) and (3) Their mouth parts are very rudi-
mentary, and it is believed that they live
throughout the adult stage entirely without food.
(4) To prevent the flies from finding a suitable
lodgment for their eggs, the long hairs should
be clipped off or singed from the nose, lips,
jaws, shoulders and legs of all horses. Regular
daily grooming should be carried out to detach
any fly eggs, before they have time to hatch,
and the parts from which the long hairs have
been removed should be smeared daily with a
mixture of oil 20 parts, turpentine and kero-
sene 1 part. After a horse is affected, viz.,
when the bot-fly grubs are in the stomach,
medicines are of little service in removing them
until the summer months, when they are natur-
ally expelled. It is then advisable to adminis-
ter one of the following drenches: (a) Turpen-
tine 20z., mixed in one pint of milk; or ( b )
carbolic acid 2 drachms, glycerine 20z., water
40z., milk 1 pint. Either of these should be
followed with 5 drachms of aloes, as a ball,
or 1 pint of raw linseed oil.
(1) Could rabbits be wiped out in wheat belts
by the introduction of badgers, polecats,
weasels and stoats ? (2) Would foxes be help-
ful or domestic cats gone wild ? —941.
(1) They might destroy rabbits, but they
would become a pest through their attacks on
poultry and would help in the extermination of
native birds and smaller animals. (2) The fox
is a good rabbit destroyer, but like all other
enemies of bunny he will turn his attention
to poultry, lambs or game rather than starve.
Domestic cats gone wild undoubtedly destroy
rabbits, but in the field rather than in the
burrow.
(1) How much are Queensland shire councils
paying■ for dingo scalps ? (2) Definition of
“scalp” ? (3) Is the rest of the hide of any
value ? (4) How are dingoes poisoned and at
what price can baits be obtained ? —1056.
(1) At least ss. each. (2) The skin on the
top of the head, both ears, a strip along the
back and the tail. (3) No. (4) Queensland
Government sells baits at ss. per box of about
250 baits. Strychnine is also sold at a cheap
rate to those who prefer to make their own
baits. The baits or strychnine may be obtained
through a shire council or direct from the
Government Poison Store, Roma-street, Bris-
bane. Dingo traps are retailed by pastoral
firms.


BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
Sydney Prices
Sydneyites pay more for their bread
than the people of any other Australian
capital. In November, 1933 —and that
Was before the Commonwealth flour tax
was imposed—Sydney bread was dearer
than that in any of the 30 Australian cities
and towns recorded by the Commonwealth
Statistician, excepting Broken Hill. The
Sydney 21b. loaf cost sd. ; the same loaf
could be got for 4.9 d. in Newcastle, 3.7 d.
in Melbourne, 4d. in Adelaide, 3.9 d. in
Perth, 4d. in Northam and 4.2 d. in
Geraldton (W.A.). In December the
Sydney price went up to 5.46 d., as against
4.6 d. in Melbourne, 4.9 d. in Perth, and
less than 4d. in Hobart, which gets most
of its flour from the mainland.
So it goes on down the list. Milk
was dearer in Sydney last December
than in any recorded Australian town
except Kalgoorlie and Boulder (W.A.)
and Queenstown (Tas.). Sirloin of beef
cost 9.1 d. a pound in Sydney, 8.9 d. in
Melbourne, 6.6 d. in Brisbane, 7.8 d. in
Adelaide. Rent of a five-roomed house
averaged 18s. lOd. in Sydney, 17s. 6d. in
Melbourne and 15s. in Brisbane.
The price of flour was 47.8 d. for 251 b.
in Sydney as against 44.2 d. in Melbourne.
Not much of a margin ; but there was,
in December, a difference of nearly a
penny a loaf in the retail price in the
two cities. Where does it go? The
baker doesn’t seem to be getting it. Gar-
trell White, Automatic Bread Baking and
Fresh Food and Ice Co., all of Sydney,
have had a thin time. Higher taxes and
higher regulated wages supply most of
the explanation. Costs and prices chase
each other, and labor in the ultimate is
no better off. And, of course, the distri-
buting side is overdone ; it is ridiculous,
for instance, for one street of 40 houses
to be served by anything up to a dozen
milkmen and bakers.
There was a time when Sydney was the
cheapest place in Australia to live. It is
now about the dearest. The overcapital-
ised railways, notwithstanding that motor
competition has been killed, still charge
exorbitant fares on many lines, and still
produce terrific deficits. It isn’t that the
rank and file of the employees receive
too high real wages ; the present steep
fares and deficits are the result of pro-
digal expenditure over a long period of
Government borrowing when times were
flush.
“Sulphide Reefs”: Sydney papers last
week featured the earnings of New
York stockbrokers in the same edi-
tion as a report on the disloca-
tion of Sydney ’Change owing to
heavy mining turnovers. Normally
there are three calls of about three-
quarters of an hour each. Last Wednes-
day the 10.15 call didn’t finish until
a few minutes before 12, and the noon
call was cancelled. On the turnover in 38
principal mining cos. (out of about 70
dealt in) Sydney sharebrokers must have
raked in something like £llOO or £l2OO
on the day. That excludes mining
shares in which turnover was not parti-
cularly heavy, and the entire investment
sales. Many brokers themselves con-
sider that brokerage rates are too high,
and that the scale of charges is too
steeply graded. The person who buys a
gold share at ss. has to get ss. 4d.
before he clears commission charges. And
both buyer and seller pay commission
on mining scrip. The only excuse for the
present high rates is that they discourage
gambling.
H: * * *
If the new N. S. Wales Companies Bill
as outlined by Premier Stevens passes
into law, it will be a great improvement
on the existing Act. Companies will not
be allowed to commence business until
the minimum subscription for allotment
(as per the prospectus) has been reached.
Most companies which fail do so through
lack of capital. A balance sheet will have
to be filed each year with the registrar
of companies, and it must be audited.
It is not necessary under the present Act
for a co. to have auditors unless the
articles insist. The C.S.R., for instance,
sends out a balance sheet without any
auditor’s certification. Not that that is
any worry to C.S.R. shareholders; but
in many other concerns it would be.
Shareholders will also be entitled under
the new ordinance to have a balance
sheet presented to them every year ; and
holding cos. will have to disclose subsi-
diaries’ figures. Mr. Stevens didn’t touch
on the aspect of forestry bonds.
* * * *
“J.W.S.L.”: According to “S. M.
Herald,” Sydney Water Board is about
to buy more cars at a cost of £3898.
Included is one at £7o7—for the presi-
dent. The excuse is that “the Crossley
hitherto used has run 65,000 miles.” It
would be interesting to know what the
makers would have to say about their
car being scrapped after a run of 65,000
miles.
* * ■* *
Among other things mentioned by L.
V. Waterhouse, B.E: and a director of
Placer Development, at Adelaide Uni.
the other day was that £3,250,000 worth
of gold had been produced in New
Guinea to the end of March. Bulolo
Gold Dredging commenced work in
March, 1932, and in the next 12 months
dug 10,120,000 yards of gravel for 6-V
tons of gold, valued at £1,200,000 Aust.
The work gives direct employment to
220 whites, while Guinea Airways, en-
gaged in carrying freight and passengers
from Lae to the goldfields, employs an-
other 55.
.-I: * * *
The Standards Association of Aus-
tralia, which has done good work in
standardising sizes of electrical fittings
and power-points, etc., is turning its atten-
tion to rabbit-proof wire-nettings. It is
co-operating with landmen and manu-
facturers to evolve a standard mesh and
gauge. Australian manufacturers have
over 550 varieties of netting on their
lists; which, of course, is absurd.
* * * *
“Crops”: The success of the Ido-
meneus shipment of chilled beef from
“I’m looking for the little cove who helped you pull the wall down."
“So am I.”
Brisbane to Britain has opened up a big
prospect for Queensland cattlemen.
Chairman Sunners, of the Q.M.I. board,
says that the Brisbane abattoirs intend to
ship some 18,000 quarters to Britain
before the end of this year. Shipments
have already been scheduled for the Auto-
lycus (May 19), the Idomeneus (June 14),
the Automedon (July 7), the Jervis Bay
(August 3) and the Meriones (August
27). Additional freight will be sent from
September to December. It is now up
to cattle-breeders to supply the right type
of beast and to the Queensland Govern-
ment to reform its methods of rail trans-
port.
* * * *
“Roan Antelope”: Australia, in-
terested in the development of chilled-
meat export, is apt to forget that some-
one else will have to be pushed out of
the Smithfield market. Statistics show
that last year Southern Rhodesia sent
lll,ooocwt. of chilled beef to Britain —
a great deal more than this country has
exported to date. But Southern Rhodesia,
like Australia and other Dominions, is
likely to be stung by the restriction bug.
The British Government has asked it to
keep its chilled-beef exports for this year
down to last year’s figures. In this case,
as in our own, it looks as if an infant
industry is in danger of being smothered
at birth, or, at the best, of having to
mark time indefinitely.
* * * *
Vesteys, having acquired the Angliss
meatworks at Lake’s Creek (Rockhamp-
ton), are considering the establishment
of an entirely new plant on the water-
front at Port Alma, estimated to cost
£300,000. Queensland Minister for Agri-
culture Bulcock mentions that Swifts and
Armours, both of Chicago, have taken
options over killing works in North and
Central Queensland. This looks like an
attempt by American capital to benefit
under the Ottawa agreement.
* * * *
Governments of eight rubber-produc-
ing countries are being asked by the
growers’ association to enact a regula-
tion agreement by which further plant-
ings will be prohibited and replanting
limited to a fifth of existing areas. The
producing countries are to send dele-
gates to an international committee for
the purpose of allotting quotas for the
period June 1 next to Dec. 31, 1938.
Governments are asked to place export
duties on the product for research work
in finding new uses for rubber. No
price-fixing is contemplated. British in-
vestors have £150,000,000 in rubber plan-
tations and have been getting little or
nothing on their money since the col-
lapse of the Stevenson restriction scheme,
which failed mainly because of the un-
fettered operations of native growers in
the Dutch East Indies. If the various
producing countries fall in with the
present scheme, 99 p.c. of production
will be covered.
* * * *
“Emptor”: The street barrowman who
puts all the specked apples at the bottom
of the bag and the spit-and-polish
ones on the top has his opposite number
in many trades and industries. A man
was convicted by a Maoriland jury the
other day of topping bales of wool and
offering them for sale. The prosecution
said the bales were packed so that the
fleeces at each end were average 21-pence
quality, while the middle contained stuff
rated at about ninepence.
“Cru”: The French contention that the
names of many wines are “regional” and
therefore not to be adopted by the wine-
makers of other lands (B. 2/5/’34) is
flatly contradicted by Andre Simon, him-
self a Frenchman and one of the world’s
leading authorities on wines. Simon states
bluntly that there is now no geographical
meaning attaching to the names of such
wines as Chablis, Graves, hock, Sauterne,
Burgundy and claret, and adds that, while
he regrets the fact, the use of these names
by Australia and South Africa is per-
fectly justified, provided the name of the
country of origin is on the label as well
as that of the wine type, a concession
Australia and South Africa have always
been ready to make. The mention of
hock in Simon’s list is interesting, since
it is not a French wine. The name
should strictly apply to the product of the
Hocheimer vineyards of the Rhine Pro-
vinces of Germany, but is now generally
applied to all Rhine wines as opposed to
those from the Moselle. Germany does
not seem to be bothering about the gen-
eral application of the name to Australian
and South African wines.
* * * *
“El V.”: Whatever other complaint
big business in Italy has against the ex-
Socialist Mussolini, it can have no kick
coming on the score of prosperity. Snia
Viscosa, the big artificial silk firm, this
year pays 7 p.c., distributing about
£A450,000 in dividends. The share-
holders of La Societa Prielli get
£4,000,000 worth of watered shares and
10 p.c. Fiat’s widows and orphans have
to be satisfied with 5 p.c., but some of
them will find it weighted up a bit with
the 14 p.c. which the Adriatic Electrical
Corporation is handing out on ten mil-
lions of capital. The Edison Electric
show, which has over £30,000,000 invested
in it, has added three millions to its
share register, the nominal value of
shares being raised from 500 to 550
lire, and it is paying its regular 8 p.c.
No wonder the Italian cables jubilate
about equilibria economico meraviglioso,
seeing that most of the concerns men-
tioned were facing bankruptcy a decade
and a half ago.
* * * *
The Japanese woollen textile industry
is the most prosperous in Nippon. Seven
companies with capitals of over
£6,000,000 (exchange at par) showed
profits of 23 p.c. on capital during 1933.
About half of the earnings went to
reserve. In 1930 profits averaged only
about 8 p.c. The industry is expanding,
and, though still comparatively small,
woollen exports have increased threefold
since 1930. Korea and Manchukuo are
the principal customers.
* * * *'
“0.W.W.”: Maoriland’s Dairy Pro-
duce Board continues to wrangle over
quotas and dumping duties, giving ho
thought to increasing consumption oif
milk. Although more than twk?e as
many cows are milked in the "Worth
Island as in the South, there are no con-
densed-milk factories in the North. M.L.
milk is tinned only in the far south, and
the output is apparently insufficient, for
condensed milk continues to be imported.
,** * *
"J.C.L.”: Satisfactory though the oil
content of Maoriland tung-nuts may be
(B. 18/4/’34), the residue (which in the
case of linseed is a great cattle-fattener)
is of dubious value. The Rowett Re-
search Institute of Aberdeen found that,
although tung-oil cake was fairly rich in
proteins and carbohydrates, it contained
irritating substances. In China the resi-
dual oil cake is used as a fertiliser or
burnt.
* * * *
“C. 8.”: A cracked idea is the notion
of naming new Australian towns after
Cold Country metropoli in order to build
up business connections. The
latest proposal of the sort
comes from the Lord Mayor
of Bristol, who has elicited
a reply from Priminisljajr
Lyons that a new town site
somewhere will duly be
the name of Bristol. The
only increase in trade acti-
vity likely from the project
is a few misdirected letters
and cablegrams.

“Ben”: There is now a
safety-razor which flood-
lights the scene of operations
automatically. A slender
torch, focussed below the
cutting-edge of the blade, is
concealed in the handle. It
was designed for hikers and
campers' by the British Ever-
ready Battery Co., and retails
in England at 3s. 6d.

“Pat Bushie”: The old belief that
“findings is keepings” dies hard. A
Burrowa (N.S.W.) resident found ,a hat-
box containing feminine garments. He
made no secret about it, but did not try
to look for the owner. One of the
people he didn’t tell was the police ser-
geant. A magistrate found him guilty of
larceny by finding, and fined him £5.
* * * *
“Engee”: Fancy waistcoats are not the
only articles of apparel for which
skins of unborn calves are used. Last
winter Vic. tanners could not get suffi-
cient raw skins to supply the demands of
garment manufacturers, who use them
for ladies’ fur coats; of bagmakers,
who work them up into handbags to
match the coats ; and of shoe manufac-
turers, who are frequently asked for shoes
to match the coats and handbags. This
matching is the bugbear of tanners, who
have difficulty in supplying the various
brown and fawn shades wanted in the
Jersey, Hereford and Ayrshire type of
skin, and find the Friesian skins, with
their black-and-white markings, difficult
to dispose of.

Australia’s credit balance overseas at
the end of nine months of the . finan-
cial year was £37,857,000 sterling—
—£46,32l,ooo Australian —despite at de
cline in gold and specie export - from
£20,000,000 to £6,000,000 Australian.
It would need only about £7,000,000 to
bring the balance level with the total
value of imports.

Mackay Gets a Harbor
“B.”: So Mackay is to have a million-
pound harbor? And why not? Other
towns have harbors which have cost
more. In the past Mackay has been more
or less content with its wharves for shal-
low-draught vessels on the Pioneer River,
with a dredged channel to the anchorage
under Flat Top Island, sugar and other
cargo being lightered the intervening six
miles.
However, the present system, though
costly, is reliable, and Flat Top provides
a safe anchorage in all weathers. But
the site chosen for the harbor is, in the
opinion of men who have been reckoned
pretty good judges, unsafe in bad
weather. And nobody seems to worry
that several sugar mills in the dis-
trict are strongly opposed to a scheme
which will involve them in greatly in-
creased mill-to-wharf costs without offer-
ing any reduction in the cost of loading,
since the board proposes to levy harbor
dues equal to the present rate of lighter-
age. Possibly the mills will derive some
satisfaction from knowing that they are
helping to pay the interest on a harbor
worthy of the town.
After all, a town with a council com-
posed of far-seeing and energetic aider-
men, and a Harbor Board consisting of
progressive and intelligent men, simply
must have a harbor worthy of them, even
if it can’t afford it.
Mr. Forgan Smith, as local member,
naturally accepts the scheme with open
arms. Quite a large portion of the mere
million pounds involved will be absorbed
in wages, and the project is thus well
worth including in any plan of develop-
mental works. As he has pointed out,
any deficiency in the annual interest bill
will be met by the ratepayers.
Of course, it will probably be rather
a strain raising the “necessary” to make
good the deficiency, because the income
of the district will have fallen off to a
certain extent. The whole of the harbor
dues collected will go
south to pay the loan
interest, instead of be-
ing spent locally, as is
the case with most of
the money now paid as
lighterage.
But Australians as a
whole, and Queens-
landers in particular,
are used to paying for
their expensive lux-
uries, and the Mackay
people will doubtless
bear their burden
proudly..
The Northern Patrol
“Trepang”: “C. Coral” (B. 11/4/’34)
and “Kaloa” (B. 28/3/’34) are right
about the necessity for prompt policing
of our northern waters. Both of them
obviously have local knowledge. Each of
them condemns the ship which is now
being built, which will be a futile white
elephant of a thing. We of the North
want protection—not show —and we
know that the case is growing more
urgent every day.
That ship being built —will she be
called the Senator Pearce? —will be less
than useless.
The charts show that, except for the
trade routes, which were opened up by
the mercantile marine, the Barrier Sea
is unmarked water, with God alone
knows what reefs hidden below. Is
an expensive ship going to poke her nose
into those dangerous waters in pursuit
of an escaping lugger? Emphatically she
is not! The Senator Pearce will draw
over 20 feet of water. The lugger or the
sampan draws only five to seven. Apart
from that, the officer commanding the
pirate ship will have a knowledge of the
reefs. The Senator’s captain and navi-
gating officer will be groping blindfolded,
without even the ability to follow where
the other might lead.
A small fleet of mosquito craft would
cost about one-tenth of the proposed
vessel. They would do ten times the
work.
“Questo”: The Great Barrier Reef is
in Queensland; legal opinion seems to
have settled that. Now, what about our
other boundaries? The Macintyre River
in the south forms portion of the border,
but the Crown Law Departments of
Queensland and N.S.W. have failed to
give any definite ruling as to whether it
is the north or south bank or the middle
of the river. In cases of drowning or
suicide nobody seems certain which State
should hold the inquest. As regards
N.T., you may drive through any one of
the border gates and yet still be in
Queensland. On account of an error in
survey, the border fence was erected eight
feet on the Queensland side of the actual
boundary.
* * * *
“Innisfail”: The so-called Italian Black
Hand ear-removers who were sentenced
to seven years’ hard by Douglas, J., last
week may not belong to any society in
Italy, but they undoubtedly belong to a
well-entrenched gang in the North. As
far back as 1926 there were evidences
of its working, but there was insuper-
able difficulty in obtaining convic-
tions or even evidence. In a number
of cases, persons seriously wounded were
obdurate in their silence. But the gang
has overreached itself; the law-abiding
Italians and Sicilians have decided
apparently to end the racket. The just-
convicted ear-choppers were sentenced in
the Cairns court; there is no Circuit
“Why, I thought he caught the Brisbane train?”
“Yes, boss, so he did—but it got away from him again."
Court at Innisfail, as “Carbonari” says
(B. 25/4/’34). It was shifted from Innis-
fail in 1927 to the city further north-
ward, partly owing to the representations
of Mr. Douglas.
* * * *
“Boka”: During the past few weeks
Westralia has had exceptionally heavy
rains. Many north-west stations have
already received double their annual
rainfall. Onslow, which was wrecked by
a willy-willy that caused damage esti-
mated at £BO,OOO, has an annual rainfall
of nine inches, and has already had 20
inches. Windjip, an outcamp on Anna
Downs, has had 41 inches for the year,
three times its average fall. In 14 hours
19i inches fell, which broke all State
records, though Whim Creek in 1898 had
a fall of 29.41 inches in 24 hours.
* * * *
“N’lmporte”: The chief trouble with
J. (“Bill”) Hart, who has died in Bris-
bane, was that he tried to do too many
things. He was an illustrator in wash,
line and lino-cuts, and mixed up sculp-
ture, oils, water-colors, pencil and pen-
and-ink work in his wide range of
activity. The time he devoted to craft
work —repousse, leatherwork, inlay and
the like—would have enabled him to do
something really big in plastic or glytic
art had he tried. The ability was there.
He was an exhibitor in the R.A. Society
and was for some years chairman of the
Sketch Club.
* * % *
“Pourri Pourri”: In his defence of
“Isee” on Papuan sorcery, “Dibatau” (B.
4/4/’34) revives the long-exploded theory
that the Papuans, magicians and laymen
alike, are expert poisoners. The matter-
has been dealt with so often in official
and medical reports that it is hardly
worth refuting the legend again.
Expert opinion now acknowledges no
proof that the Papuan has a deep know-
ledge of toxicology. Personally, I never
heard of an instance, and I shall be glad
if “D.” can tell me the names of any
Papuan poisons, from what they are com-
pounded and how prepared. Firms like
Burroughs and Wellcome and Parke
Davis are always eager to be introduced
to new drugs, especially those of vege-
table origin, and any special information
in that line would be readily saleable.
The only instance I recall where a sor-
cerer was really discredited in the eyes
of his patients was on the Opi River in
the Northern Division. A village con-
stable was annoyed by the pretensions of
a local magician. By way of making
him prove that he was lord over life
and death as he claimed, the v.c. tied
the warlock to a pole and sank him in
a deep waterhole, promising that if he
was alive in the morning he—the v.c. —
would repent of his doubts and become
one of his most devoted followers. Some-
thing went wrong with the magic, and
the medicine man was not alive when
fished up. Even in that case the dis-
credit applied only to that particular sor-
cerer, and the general impression was
that the v.c. triumphed because he was
a better pourri-pourri man than deceased.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Mrs. A. J. Jones, Brisbane’s Lady Mayoress
elect, is a quiet soul who is always ready to
lend a hand to the under-dog. Her private
charities can only be gauged by those whom
she has helped—their name is legion.
In the Jones home at Eagle Junction are the
Lord Mayor and his wife, two unmarried daugh-
ters, and Mrs. Leggatt, Mrs. Jones’s mother. An
Australian born in Adelaide, Mrs. Leggatt has
seen 90 years roll by, and still is keenly interested
in life and progress. Fine stitchery and books
are her hobby. The two Jones girls are golfers,
and have a putting green in their own back-
yard. The Jones family numbers nine—four
sons and five daughters—and there are 13 grand-
children.
Dorothy Drouyn and Gwen Spurgin, two
leading spirits in our hockey world, will be
seen soon in bridal array. The hockey players
entertained them at a “white gift evening” at
the home of the president, Mrs. George Boul-
ton, and both girls carried away enough house-
linen to stock the largest of hope chests.
Mrs. F. R. Hall, president of the Windsor
Croquet Club for 18 consecutive years, has
retired. The club made her a life member, and
presented her with a gold badge.
F. A. Crawshaw, general secretary in Aus-
tralia to the Mission to Lepers, is in Brisbane,
trying to raise the wind. His society provides
religious instruction, food, shelter and medical
aid for lepers in overseas countries. There are
37 Protestant societies working with the mis-
sion, and more than 100 stations are under
its control.
To-morrow night our grass-widower Gov-
ernor will be present at a ball which will mark
the opening of the new Bellevue Hotel ball-
room and provide a financial lift for Nazareth
House, the District Nurses’ Association and
the Creche and Kindergarten. Panelled‘walls
and crystal chandeliers help to make the new
ballroom a thing of beauty.
Captain G. R. Garrick, of Wynnum, one
of the few genuine old salts, has a fascinating
hobby. He makes models of clippers like the
Reindeer and Cutty Sark. He sailed them on the
ruffled waters of the wading pool at Wynnum,
and told to an interested audience of girls from
the Moreton Bay High School the histories
of those famous ships and their part in the
epic days of sail.
Another Scandinavian aristocrat, the Countess
E. Verenkop Castenskjold, of Sweden, arrived
in Brisbane the other day by the Nieuw Zeeland.
She proved to be as aloof as Greta Garbo,
and as difficult to interview as that other Coun-
tess, a Danish lady, who arrived here a few
weeks ago. The Countess is doing a world
tour.
Mrs. Roland Flower, an Englishwoman who
was aboard the Nieuw Zeeland, has never been
in Australia before, although she has travelled
extensively in other parts of the world. India,
Siam and Cochin China have been glanced
over by her, and she once was in a train in
Manchuria which was held up by bandits. She
will glance at Maoriland and U.S.A. before
packing her ports for London again.
The Logan and Albert A. and P. Society held
its 42nd annual show at Beaudesert last
week. Beaudesert being the home of some of
the oldest, best-known, and most aristocratic of
the stations of Queensland, the show usually
develops into more of a social event than a
day out for Strawberry. Mr. and Mrs. John
Collins had a house party, and Beryl Col-
lins took the championship ribbon for blood
mares with her beautiful Cyclone. Mary
Persse, a member of another famous old Logan
family, also had an entry in the blood mares
section, but Beryl Collins’s quadruped was too
good for her.
Ruth Griffiths, a Queensland girl who was
awarded the Foundation Travelling Scholarship
of the Queensland Uni. in 1927, has been gath-
ering fresh honors ever since she went to Eng-
land. After collecting a Ph.D. from London
University, she came back to Queensland and
the Department of Public Instruction. Later
on, she returned to England, and did research
work at the London Child Guidance Clinic.
Now she has been appointed for fixe years,
under the Burden Research Trust, as assistant
psychologist in the Stoke Park Colony for de-
fective children, outside Bristol. An M.A. de-
gree (in absentia ) was conferred qn the lady
on Commem. Day for her thesis on “The
Function of Phantasy in the Young Child’s
Mental Development.”
Last week Dr. J. V. Duhig performed
the official opening of a show by local artists,
all the studies being of the Brisbane River.
Vida Lahey (who, by the way, is doing talks
over the air on Art), Jeanette Sheldon and
brother Vincent, Gwen Grant, Enid Dickson,
Billy Bustard, C. H. Lancaster and P. S.
Templeton were among the artists represented.
But it is just as well to keep away from the
show, unless you have the purse of Fortunatus,
otherwise you leave fracturing the sixth com-
mandment. .
That statuesque beauty Mrs. Arnold Wein-
holt is in town staying with her mother, Mrs.
Joshua T. Bell. Mrs. Bell was Mrs. Sydney
Jones, widow of a northern solicitor, when she
married Joey, son of Joshua Peter Bell. Her
son, J. T. M., is on the land, and his pretty
wife also is visiting Brisbane and staying with
her mother-in-law.
Like all the rest of us, the Creche and Kin-
dergarten Association is badly in need of funds;
so there is to be a floral festival to provide
some of the needful. The first meeting hap-
pened at Lennon’s Hotel, and Mrs. Forgan
Smith presided. The festival is to be held in
the City Hall in September, and besides floral
beauty there will be musical programmes in
the evenings, and maypole dances by children.
The association has given so much aid to
destitute families that it has cramped itself
financially.
Miss Bedford, who was one of the moving
spirits in the formation of the Creche and
Kindergarten and the Children’s _ Playgrounds
Association, has retired from active work on
those committees, but still is a life member of
both organisations. She is a very wonderful
woman. Although not so young_ as she once
was, she hopped into active service when the
war was on, and served for a long period in
Serbia. The women in her corps did everything,
even to digging out bogged motor-cars and
all motor repairs. Dr. Lillian Cooper, who is
Miss Bedford ? s great friend, and with whom
she shares a bachelor residence at Kangaroo
Point, was one of the medicoes at the hospital
to which Miss Bedford and other fine women
carried the mangled remnants of the Serbian
army.
Rumor is busy whispering horrid stories
of a Nude Club which is said to be flourishing
in Brisbane. “And,” say the whisperers, “they
don’t even go in the sun, my dear! They take
off all their clothes, and dance to a gramo-
phone!” It seems a dreary way of spending
these gorgeous moonlight nights.
One’s ears are still twitching after a long
conversation with a man from the North, who
declares that he is in the know so far as the
dope-running business is concerned. He tells
stories of innocent-looking trochus, shells filled
with cocaine and deftly plugged with a spare
cat’s-eye; of mystery ’planes which drop
packages equipped with a float, and of appar-
ently innocent fishing parties which retrieve
the packages, and bring them home among the
stiff bodies of glittering fish, for dispatch to
various country towns. His facts may or may
not be correct —but, oh! what thrilling read-
ing!
Miss Ellwood, who for six and a half years
has been endeavoring to spread Christianity
among the natives of Southern India, has come
back to Queensland on 18 months’ furlough.
She will spend most of it in Childers, her home
town. Miss El wood works in the Tamil area,
and has her headquarters at an unspellable
place a few hours’ journey from Bangalore.
The railway is 40 miles away, and the district
over which she and another mission worker
toil comprises about 200 villages.
Died recently, Charles William Roe, second
son of Reginald Heber Roe, M.A., for many
years master of the Brisbane Boys’ Grammar
School, Bill Roe was a keen. footballer,
and played both for Sydney Uni: —whither
he went from the Brisbane Grammar School —
and for Queensland. He spent some years in
West Africa, and enlisted there, joining up with
the Royal Engineers. After the war he spent
a few months in Queensland, and then returned
to Africa, but found the climate too much for
him, and returned to his own country. His
grandparents, Captain and Mrs. Whish, were
among those who were drowned when the
Quetta went down.

skippered the English side in South
Africa in 1927-28,. and also captained
Yorkshire for a time. The major has

“Tsetse”: A weatherworn old tale
cropped up in the cables the other day
when Sir Leonard Rogers, an authority
on tropical disease, told an English audi-
ence that Germany had offered to barter
a new and infallible remedy for sleeping
sickness in return for the restoration of
her lost colonies. The drug in question
is “Bayer 205,” a derivative of trypan
blue, the formula of which was published
10 years ago. Some German paper
started the yarn that the offer had been
made and that, if it were not accepted,
the formula would be destroyed and the
East African colonies allowed to perish.
The story was officially denied by Ger-
many, and was further discounted when
two Frenchmen rediscovered the drug.
Neither the German nor French version
has proved effective, both being danger-
ous and unreliable.

A Maorilander in London writes
enthusiastically of “The Merchant,” then
being staged at the Alhambra, and in
particular of Marie Ney as Portia; “but
for the life of me I can’t understand why
she wears horn-rimmed glasses in the
court scene,” she adds. Neither, evi-
dently, can the critic of London “Truth.”
He says Marie’s appearance is “rendered
unnecessarily comic by the addition of a
pair of horn-rimmed spectacles, un-
dreamed of till at least two centuries
after Shakspeare.” Marie should know
something of the Bard’s works and how
to play them, for she got her first chance
on the stage from Allan Wilkie in windy
Wellington, her home town.

“S.T.S.”: New views on Shakspeare,
as found, and pilloried, by examiners of
Adelaide ’Varsity, in the public exams.
Macbeth is “a moral coward at first;
that is, he will not satisfy his ambition by
foul means.” Lady Macbeth, on the
other ha.nd, is a true heroine, “a stern

“Bummalo”: “Sailor’s” sweeping con-
demnation of Indian curries (B. 2/5/’34)
suggests that he has never eaten a curry
made in a decent Indian hotel or on any
of the many lines of steamers running to
Eastern Asia, with all their numerous
additions and adjuncts in the way of
sambals, and so on. Further, his asser-
tion that curry is only “Indian Irish stew”
with a fiery content shows an entire
ignorance of the mystery of curry-com-
posing and -cooking. In only one respect
does “Sailor” approach accuracy, when
he says the ingredients for curry powder
should be freshly ground every day. All
those ingredients—tumeric, dried red
chillies, peppercorns, coriander seed
and bay leaves are the principal ones
—can be obtained in any well-stocked
grocer’s shop, and often are by
curry enthusiasts. All the same, a
good Indian brand of paste or powder
is well worth while. I have yet to taste
a powder made in Australia which is
even passable, much as I regret to say so.

3s. Apply to the officer in charge, Base
Records, Defence Dept., Melbourne.
Do fumes from car-radiator repairs injure
the throat, lungs or blood ? Any respirator on
the market to prevent inhalation ? —(274.
Heart and lungs would be affected, possibly
fatally, by inhalation of carbon-monoxide fumes
when working in a confined space (garage, etc.)
with the engine running. Immediate collapse
may result from chemical changes in the blood
(car b oxy-h ae mo gl obi n) owing to curtailed ab-
sorption of oxygen by the lungs. Pure c.-m. gas
is odorless; that associated with air may be
recognised by its odor. When it is limited or
rarefied in the air, prolonged inhalation of
c.-m. fumes first causes weakness of the limbs,
with more serious symptoms later. Avoid
trouble by efficient ventilation when at work.
Respirators of the usual type are no use against
c.-m. poisoning.
The tone of an old portable gramophone is
very tinny on loud passages. Cause and remedy 7
—1363.
Old sound-boxes do not respond to the loud
amplitudes of modern electrical recordings.
The trouble may be remedied by purchasing a
modern sound-box. These can be got from
Shaw, Lloyd and Co., 240 Pitt-street, Sydney,
for about 21s.
(1) Exports of New Caledonia 7 (2) Is it still
a penal settlement 7 (3) If not, why are so
many soldiers kept there 7—1290.
(1) Nickel, chrome and coffee. (2) No. (3)
The only soldiers are the regular garrison.
Purpose of the tentacles of the crimson sea-
anemone? What does it live on, and how does
it capture prey ? Can it move of its own
accord 7—1377.
The tentacles capture food, and have stinging-
cells like those of hydroid zoophytes; they
form a powerful offensive and defensive appa-
ratus. When molested or exposed at low tide
the anemone can contract to a small fleshy
knob. It feeds on living organisms and small
fish. Although usually attached to rocks,
shells, etc., sea-anemones can move by slow,
gliding motions of the lower extremity; and
more rarely by the tentacles used as feet. In
aquaria they have moved nine inches in a
night.
At what velocity did the worst cyclone ex-
perienced in Queensland travel ? I always
understood it was well over 100 m.p.h., but
am told that I am mistaken. —1288.
Many disastrous cyclones have swept the
Queensland coast, but there is no information
as to which was actually the worst. Accurate
instrumental observations of the velocity of
the wind in cyclones are not available for the
more disastrous of them; but it is almost cer-
tain that gusts have occurred in some instances
at a greater rate than 100 m.p.h.
Should a radio-receiving set fitted with auto-
matic volume control be more poisy than a
similar set not so fitted ? —l4OB.
One object of a.v.c. is to increase the strength
of weak signals while limiting the strength of
powerful ones. It acts as if the volume control
of an ordinary receiver were kept at maximum
in the absence of a signal and decreased the
moment a station is tuned in. Therefore, a
set fitted with a.v.c. will, at first, appear noisy,
but when tuned to a station it will actually
be no noisier than a manually-controlled set.
As the tuning dial is moved away from the
signal, the sensitivity increases, and weak static,
valve hiss, etc., make their appearance just as
they would in an ordinary set if the volume
control were set at maximum sensitivity.
(1) Working pressure of Stanley steam-car ? (2)
Time taken to raise steam ? (3) Advantages of
steam-car 7 (4) How often must water be
taken up ? —1420.
(1) All models normally operate on a steam
pressure of 6001 b., but for speed purposes this
pressure is run up as high as 12001 b. to 15001 b.
(2) Fifteen minutes, including filling of tanks
and boiler. (3) Lack of vibration, absence of
clutch, more power to weight than is possible
with gasoline engines, and low upkeep cost.
(4) About every 200 miles on ordinary running.
1 am building a six-valve wireless set where-
in the first five valves take a total heater cur-
rent of 5 amps, at 2.5 volts. There are two
heater windings on the power transformer, each
giving 2.5 volts at 3 amps. Should 1 parallel
these two windings in order to get the re-
quired current for these valves ?— 339.
Would not be advisable, as it is not usually
possible to ascertain the direction of the wind-
ings, and if they are incorrectly joined up the
transformer will probably be damaged. Feed
three heaters from one winding and the re-
maining two, together with the dial light, from
the other winding.
(1) Would it be possible to employ a West-
inghouse copper-oxide rectifier for delivering a
direct current of 120 amperes at 240 volts from
an A.C. supply of 240 volts ? (2) Would such
a scheme be practicable ? (3) What efficiency
could I expect ? (4) Average life of these rec-
tifiers ? —623.
(1) It could be done by connecting seven P.T.
120 rectifiers in parallel, but the cost would be
prohibitive and a step-up transformer would be
necessary. (2) No, the cost of such a unit
would be over £2BOO. (3) The efficiency of these
rectifiers averages over 60 p.c., this efficiency
being expressed as a ratio of the mean D.C.
volt-amperes to R.M.S. A.C. volt-amperes. (4)
Practically unlimited, if the rectifier is not over-
loaded.
(1) Composition of sulphocyanide nickel-
plating solution ? (2) How is it prepared ?
(3) Material of anode ? (4) Working voltage ?
(5) Working temperature ? —637.
(1) and (2) Dissolve 51b. nickel ammonium
sulphate in 10 gallons of water, then add
ammonium chloride (sal-ammoniac) Hlb., zinc
sulphate 11b., sodium carbonate 40z., and
sulphocyanide of soda in the order men-
tioned. (3) Cast nickel, 99 p.c. pure. (4)
Using the above solution an E.M.F. of j-volt
will produce best results; with other nickel
solutions, 2\ to 5 volts. (5) Artificial heat is
not normally required provided temperature of
plating bath is maintained constant and above
50deg. Fahr.
Who was the George Thomason whose col-
lection of books is in the British Museum ?
1134.
He was a London bookseller who died in
1666. Little is known about him save that
he was concerned in a royalist plot in 1651.
In 1641 he began to collect books and pam-
phlets dealing with the dispute between the king
and people. By 1662 (having escaped the usual
penalties for treason) he had collected almost
23,000 separate publications, which he arranged
in chronological order and bound in 1983
volumes. George 111. bought the collection in
1761 and presented it to the British Museum.
1 have a four-valve all-electric wireless set,
but there is no 240 -volt A.C. supply in the
district. Could this set be operated off a dry
battery, and, if so, what voltage would be suit-
able ?~ 1090.
An all-electric wireless set cannot be
operated off dry batteries without first making
drastic alterations to the wiring and replacing
some of the parts. Suggest you endeavor to
exchange your set for a battery-operated model.
An advertisement in “Radio News” might
bring satisfaction.
(1) Has the Burrinjuck dam the highest re-
taining wall in Australia? (2) To what extent
does the water level vary in the dam between
a normal and dry season ? (3) What is the
amount of electrical energy generated at the
power house ? (4) To what amount does the
electrical energy drop during a dry season ?
799.
(1) Yes. (2) Maximum variation to date has
been from full in flood years to 82 feet below
full supply level—in May, 1930. (3) For the
year ended June 30, 1933, the maximum demand
at power station was 4700 kw., and the energy
generated 21,297,709kwh. (4) So far the station
has been equal to the demands made upon it.
A friend has given hie ten bottles of good
brandy, which I wish to store. Would it be
advisable to put it in a small cask? —1192.
Leave it in the bottles and store in a cool
and dry place. The quantity is' too small to
cask.
(1) Who bred the first kelpie dogs, red and
black-and-tan, and what breeds were used ? (2)
Is it natural for a black-and-tan kelpie to have
the claws an inch or so above the hind feet ?
—917.
(1) Elliott and Allan, of Geraldra station,
near Forbes (N.S.W.), imported two black-and-
tan dogs (smooth and prick-eared, and known
as fox-collies) from Scotland about 1870,
Jenny and Brutus. Jenny had pups imme-
diately on arrival at the station, and amongst
them was a red pup, which was the beginning
of the red kelpies in Australia. Another pup,
Caesar, a black-and-tan, was bred with a black-
and-tan bitch of Gleeson’s (from Vic.) named
Kelpie. A pup was sent to C. B. W. King, of
Wollongong station, near Condobolin (N.S.W.),
a black-and-tan like the mother. Mr. King
called her Kelpie, and she won the first sheep-
dog trial at Forbes. Her pups sold at big
prices, and were called kelpies after her.
“Dew” claws are not natural on a kelpie, and
should be painlessly removed by a vet.
Names of books dealing with the develop-
ment of Melbourne? —l34l.
No comprehensive work has yet been pub-
lished. A. S. Kenyon, president of the Vic.
Historical Society, has one in hand. Selby’s
“Memorial History of Melbourne,” 12s. 6d
and Turner’s “History of Victoria” hold the
field in the meantime.

(1) Dimensions of smallest runabout boat
propelled by a 35 -h.p. outboard engine and
giving a top speed of about 25 m.p.h. ? (2)
Would a step-bottomed boat be preferable to
a V-bottom ? (3) Would you recommend a
car-type steering-wheel fitted with wires and
pulleys ? (4) Name of firm dealing with
second-hand boats from which could be ob-
tained particulars of size and cost, etc. ? —1302.
(1) Roughly, 16ft. long by sft. beam. (2)
If speed is the first consideration, a step-
bottomed boat, but if required for choppy
water a V-bottom would be preferable. (3) A
matter of taste. (4) W. Holmes, McMahon's
Point, Sydney.
How to tin iron hooks and similar small
objects ? —1263.
The object is first immersed in a solution
consisting of muriatic acid 1 part and water
3 parts. It is then washed and dipped into
muriatic acid into which have been placed a
few scraps of sheet zinc, and which has been
allowed to stand until the zinc ceases to
effervesce. Then the object is dipped gently
into a bath of molten tin into which has been
sprinkled a small quantity of sal ammoniac.
Are pouched mice tree- or ground-dwellers ?
What is their food ?— 1340.
Some pouched mice make nests among
branches or in hollows in the trunks or limbs
of trees. Others live in burrows, and some in
holes among rocks and under stones. Their
diet consists largely of insects.
What is “sea grass” or “sea wrack” ? In what
Australian waters is it to be found ? Has it
any commercial uses ? —1338.
It is Posidonia australis, a submerged mari-
time plant covering a large area in shallow
water along the coasts. It extends from West
Australia to New South Wales, and is very
plentiful in Spencer and St. Vincent gulfs,
where it has been exploited for some years. It
is rolled up into felted halls by the action 9!
the waves, and thrown up on the beach in
great quantities. The fibre manufactured from
it has been used in paper-making and for
weaving into a coarse cloth, as well as for
carpet-making.
Description of the “Eastern cut-off” style
employed by high-jumper J. P. Metcalfe ?
1330.
The approach to the bar is practically at
right-angles, a slight curve being made in
towards the take-off foot so that the leading
leg swings up at an angle to the bar and not
straight at it. Back from the bar at a con-
venient distance a check mark is placed, and
from that check to the take-off the athlete
makes his approach with even springy steps.
Metcalfe makes five steps from this mark, the
last three being about twice as fast as the first
two. He crouches a little before taking off by
bending the knee of the take-off leg and
bringing the heel of the take-off foot firmly to
the ground. The take-off is made by vigorously
straightening the leg, driving with the foot
and swinging up the leading leg. The impor-
tant feature of the style is the swing up in
front of the body of the take-off leg as the
body comes over into a horizontal position.
This means that as the body is passing over
the bar it is at right-angles to the bar, the
leading leg is pointing down and the take-off
leg is lying along the bar in front of the body.
The next stage gives the jump its name, for
the leg that has just swung up over the bar
cuts down. At the same time the body turns
so that the stomach faces the ground, the
“free leg” swings back and the arms and upper
trunk are jerked clear of the bar. The body
is still more or less horizontal as the athlete
lands on the take-off foot facing the bar.
What is the “divine right of kings” ? —1241.
The right claimed by Charles I. of England
and Louis XIV. of France to derive authority
to rule directly from the Deity.
For purposes of art representation, such as
a design for a stained-glass window, what are
the degrees of various angelic beings, and by
what conventions are they indicated ? —386.
Nine ecclesiastic degrees, divided into three
hierarchies of three orders each: Cherubim,
Seraphim, Thrones; Dominions, Virtues,
Powers; Principalities, Archangels and Angels.
Chief of each in the same order: Jophiel,
Uriel, Zaphkiel; Zadchiel, Haniel, Raphael;
Camiel, Michael and Gabriel. Angels bear the
emblems of the Flaming Sword (indicating the
wrath of God), trumpets (voice of God),
thuribles (censers, representing the prayers of
saints) and musical instruments (felicity). Angels
are messengers, and are depicted young (to
show strength), winged, and are generally clad
in white or gold. Archangels are generally
depicted with a trumpet and six wings, and
the legs bared. Occasionally they are shown
in complete armor. Similar conventions apply
to almost all save the cherubim, which are
represented as the head of an infant between
two wings, and the seraphim, which have the
same child head between three pairs of wings,
which entirely surround it. A nimbus is gener-
ally placed behind all the heads.
Extent of the mineral resources of Para-
guay ? —1373.
Exact extent is unknown. Large and work-
able deposits of rich iron ores exist. Several
mines, still operated, were worked in the time
of Lopez, whose foundries and shops turned
out cannon, cart-axles and tyres, beams and
plates. Richest deposits of magnetic iron,
hydric oxides and brown haematite are in the
neighborhood of Ibicui, Quiquyo and Caapucu.
Pyrites and peroxide of manganese abound.
Copper is known to exist in many parts. Lime-
stone, marble, granite, porphyry, serpentine
and -kaolin are found in many places. Only
the limestone is worked to any extent (for the
manufacture of cement), but the export of
kaolin to the Argentine is being attempted.
Large beds of excellent lithographic stone were
discovered a few years ago. Salt is obtained
at Lambare.

smoothness that cannot be im-
proved. Its mellow flavour is truly
pre-war—you will know that from
the first sip.
For over seventy years McNish’s
Whisky, blended in Scotland, has
been favoured throughout the

labor which enables them to lean on a
rail and wave patromsingly to passing
trains. That was how it looked to my
casual n hc Pr vatinn
Inside the ancient courtroom while
I fr/ n! L!; 1
1 was there no criminal was on
trial. Only The Bulletin, which, in
referring to the Stevens Government’s
prospective anti-Communist legislation,
had made some remarks about ruffians
who start riots hoping they would turn
into revolutions. Two toilets, who swore
lhat they were not Communists, and
whose earnest friends were clear in the
box that they had never associated them
in their thoughts with either Gommun-
ism or ruffianism, were there to try to
collect £lO,OOO between them from The
Bulletin. Friends came forward and
sadly told how the plaintiffs had fallen
in their estimation when they read the
paragraph, and there was a young
counsel—in the second case with a “very
learned friend”—to fight their battle.
Several thoughts ran through my mind
as I listened To that young advocate’s
efforts. The ffrst was how lucky two
men, for years unemployed, were to be
so represented, eveT Though counsel
were admittedly not “expensive”-THE
Bulletin’s barrister gently withdrew
that odious word when the othei side
objected to it. Secondly, I ruminated
that, if the expressions of counsel had as
much effect on me as those of news-
papers seem to have on some Newcastle
citizens, I certainly would resign my
pastorate in The Bulletin.
The plaintiffs witnesses were clear that

Mis-ter So-and-so! Mw-ter So-and-so—
smiling, gentlemen, as he did when I
referred to him in the last case,

words of Serjeant Buzfuz (who “looked
through Mr. Pickwick and talked at him”
as he spoke them) ringing down the
years: ...

this mean? Chops and Tomata Sauce!
Yours, Pickwick! Chops! Gracious heavens! •
Very evidently the chops-and-tomata-
sauce school is still with us, but
its methods have changed, except in
advocacy. Serjeant Buzfuz won his case
almost entirely on the evidence of
hostile witnesses. He called and oblit-
erated Messrs. Winkle, Snodgrass and
Tupman in short order. But when The
Bulletin’s counsel offered his opponent
a witness for nothing the testimony was
scorned without even thanks.
I suppose while there is a Bar there will
always be abuse from the more eager and
inexperienced barristers. And, while in
principle it is an iniquitous thing that any
youngster because he wears a wig can
dole out waggonloads of chops, rivers
of sauce and not a little uncleaned
tripe from the Bar-table, nobody seems
to worry much about preventing it, be-
cause it has little effect. The public takes
these things incredulously. Judges and
the more responsible section of the Bar
look down on the fireworks with a toler-
ant expression, as much as to say: “Tut,
tut! Well, boys will be boys!” Usually,
too, no attack upon a defendant’s
character can fill the holes in a rotten case.

AWOMAN'S
LETTER
There was a posy of red roses awaiting
Lady Isaacs when she and the G.-G.
arrived at David Jones’s for St. Vincent’s
Ball. There were also, in addition to the
committee, 500 people, mostly doctors
and their womenfolk, waiting to stand at
attention as “God Save” was struck up.
Lady Isaacs wore gold-embossed ivory
chiffons ; Mrs. G. E. Flannery, president
of the ball committee, entertained the
official group in trained black velvets
served with seed pearls. The Lud
Mayoral couple were there ; a diamente
buckle flashed at the waist of her prim-
rose crepes, which —for effect, rather than
for warmth —had a pleated shoulder cape.
Miss K. Egan wore a delphinium-blue
boa with her silver-rose-splashed del-
phinium-blue satins. Mrs. M. Slattery’s
fair coloring shone above dawn-grey
laces. Mrs. Frank Genge’s mulberry
crepes had a high cowl neck but no
back ; the sleeves were of the new order,
slit to the wrist, then fastened with tiny
silver buttons. Dr. Constance d’Arcy
allied blackberry satins and silver, and
Mrs. Geoffrey Hughes wore a high
coronet of dull gold with her leaf-green
crepes.
Mrs. George Rayner beckoned num-
bers of Sydney’s snappiest and brightest
young things to say au revoir to son
“Giff,” who will leave with the Games
on May 24 for England. The weather
didn’t care a hang for “Giff” and his
party; it just kept on being disagreeably
sullen, grey • and wet, so squashed all
hopes of motor-launch trips up the har-
bor. Otherwise everyone had the time of
his or her life. There were Cec Morrison’s
band to dance to and a well-stocked bar to
drink at; and when “White Horse Inn”
put up its shutters singer Strella Wilson
and the Tyrolean dancers arrived to in-
fuse fresh pep. Mrs. Rayner wore wine-
red chiffons for the hand-shaking;
daughter Joan wrapped herself in floral
taffetas. And “Giff” worked overtime
saying the right thing in the right way
to everybody.
Freddie and Freda didn’t mind having
their palm- and finger-prints taken the
other day by Detective Walkom ; neither
did the other monkeys. In fact, they
watched keenly all the proceedings and
chattered loudly and shrilly amongst
themselves when the detective and the
Zoo director, Ashur Le Souef, carried out
the operations. The reason for the opera-
tion was scientific, not criminal. A small
marmosal monkey, not much bigger than
the palm of your hand, died recently at
the age of 12, instead of living to the
ripe old age of 26. The cause of death
could not be discovered, but when a print
was taken of the animal’s hand the
death-mark, very distinct, was found just
less than half-way up the life-line. Now
scientists are busy reading the monkeys’
palms for other human characteristics.
Last year the Streets were feted be-
cause they were going away; this year
they are being feted because they have
returned. The swishest and brightest
evening affair of last week was the Vic-
toria League’s welcome at the Australia.
You stood about and talked or paid
visits to different tables, still talking.
Heads wore jewelled coronets or twisted
velvet haloes ; diamonds flashed in ear-
rings and brooch. Trains were the rule
and not the exception.
The ex-C.J.’s wife held on to her pre-
sentation pink roses and autumn leaves.
They looked well against her green orchid-
sprayed and -trained black embossed vel-
vets. The league’s deputy-president,
Miss Macarthur Onslow, wore a dress of
deep sapphire-blue laces; Mrs. Walter
Swinson wrapped herself in chiffons as
blue as a summer-afternoon sky; Mark
Sheldon’s lady rose triumphant over the
maze that was patterned in reds and
blues on her ivory chiffons, which had
a pointed train as well as a pointed cape ;
Dame Eadith Walker’s velvets were the
green of growing things in early spring ;
Miss Nellie Veitch kept her black laces
warm with a cape of white coque
feathers ; sister Mrs. F. C. Searight came
in a rose-pink velvet cape and beige
crepes ; Mrs. Vernon Cole’s laces were of
turquoise hue ; knight Fuller’s lady wore
a beautiful frock of peacock-eye embroid-
ered mist-grey chiffons, and her ermine
coat had a waist-length cape thickly
fringed in tails; Mrs. F. J. Davy wore her
favorite color, amethystine, this time in
chiffons; Jean Cheriton was graceful in
soft blue velvets; Walter Kingsmill’s
lady wore silver sequins with black laces ;
Mrs. Tom Hogan and Miss Susie Wil-
liams wore black with distinction ; Beulah
Bolton’s brown laces sported a velvet
sash, and Doreen Higgins had fin-like
frills running down the side of her
powder-blue crepes.
But it wasn’t a woman’s affair only;
husbands, titled and otherwise, were in
attendance. There were dahlias on the
supper tables, and music and Raymond
Beatty’s singing filled the night with
poetry.
The Musical Association’s party to
Pouishnoff and Horace Stevens at the
Forum Club drew such a big house that
at 7.55 president De Cairos Rego’<s wife
was wondering, hostess-like, if there’d
be sufficient cakes and sandwiches to go
round. There were. Trixie Tange wore
mulberry velvets and a Venus-starred
halo, and slipped into a white fur coat
after playing the Bach Chaconne.
At half-time the guests left Lindley
Evans to carry on, while they rushed
away to say “how do you do?” through
the mike to the thousands they hope will
applaud them in the Town Hall. Return-
ing, one said that music was an integral
part of life, not just an amusement, and
prophesied that it would one day be a
compulsory subject in our schools; the
other asked teachers to look for and
encourage individuality in their pupils.
At supper-time manager Jack Griffiths
came into the spotlight, and saw to it
that the overflow from the dining-room
had its share of coffee, sandwiches and
small talk.
There’s one picture you won’t see at
Gordon Esling’s show, to be opened to-
day by Mrs. Rodney Dangar at the
Grosvenor Galleries, and that’s the one
he went to Nowra to paint. It was a
pastoral and almost finished when one
day, with only his cow model in sight,
he left his easel and paints and went off
for lunch. When he returned he found
the cow had lunched also, and, instead of
the cow being in the picture, the picture
was in the cow!
“The Bon Voyage” Ball to Lady Game
arranged by the C.W.A. will take place
on May 18, just six days before their
Exes, leave for their holiday in England.
Mrs. W. Chapman, the subject of this
Freeman picture, is secretary of the
Eastern Suburbs branch, and she is also
doing the pen-and-ink work for the
dance. During the evening a silver-
mounted boomerang will be presented to
the guest of honor by the Harborside
branch. Gate-money will be' divided be-
tween the association’s hospitals and the
Far West Children’s Health scheme.
A military ball always goes with a
bang from the start, and that of St.
George Regiment Officers’ Mess, held at
Horderns’ on the wettest night of the
week, was no exception. To it officers
came in their uniforms of blue and gold
and scarlet ; charming girls added charm-
ing dresses and sparkling eyes. There
was a fanfare of trumpets and a roll of
drums, and Lieut. D. J. Duffy to
announce the guests. They were received
by C.O. Lieut.-Col. W. H. Douglas and
Mrs. Douglas, who combined satisfac-
torily sapphire-blue crepes with velvet in
her trained frock. Mrs. A. Holland, who
came with her Colonel, wore mulberry
velvet, and Major J. McColl brought
Mrs. McColl all wrapped round in del-
phinium-blue laces. Mrs. Manchester,
whose husband, the Lieut.-Colonel, was
among the night’s importants, wore
powder-blue chiffons. There were lots
of other majors, colonels, lieutenants and
captains, and each squired the prettiest
girl in the room. The regiment’s colors
—two shades of blue—appeared in
streamers everywhere. The official table’s
“42 Bn. H.Q.S.” in flowers caught the eye
of every dancer, and, dominating every-
thing, was the regiment’s emblem —St.
George and the dragon.
This is a Monte Luke study of Daisy
Degotardi, whose concerto was broadcast
last week under the baton of E. J.
Roberts, with Isidor Goodman as solo-
ist. Miss Degotardi composed the
first two movements when she was 12,
and confesses that she had not the slight-
est knowledge of the range or color of
the various instruments when she com-
menced the orchestration of her work.
The performance caused a big ripple in
musical circles, and Miss Degotardi. is
still receiving congratulatory messages.
A new card game now going the
rounds has at least the merit of sim-
plicity. It’s called “Fright.” You make
a pool and tumble the whole pack on
the table higgledy-piggledy, faces down.
Dealer names a card —“two of dia-
monds,” “ace of clubs” or anything—
then everybody in turn picks a card out
of the pile and shows it face-up. The
one who picks the card named is out,
and is consoled only by the right of nam-
ing the card for the next round. It goes
on till one of the two left in is unlucky.
“Inverted ‘Slippery Sam’ ” is becoming
popular in card-playing circles. Three
cards are dealt to each player and must
not be looked at. Dealer turns up cards
from the rest of the pack till he gets one
under six. All (including dealer) bet on
the assumption that their unseen cards
contain a bigger number (in suit) than
the card turned up. Within a limit you
can bet what you please.
No sooner had you put your foot into
the Women Painters’ Show than you
were carted off to see the Melbourne and
Tasmanian panels. The former dominates
the room. The women painters of Vic-
toria aren’t afraid of color; the por-
traits they have sent up prove they know
how to use it with stunning effect,
while the flowers are vivid in their in-
tensity. The Tasmanian panel is more
restrained. Of our own people, Frank
Payne’s kiddies are so full of the joy of
life that they hold the eye fast. Myrtle
lnnes’s “Garden Path” is fascinating in
its suggestion of beauty to be discovered.
Marjory Arnold has broken new ground
with her portraits, and Violet Bowring’s
dogs are so lifelike that, to avoid trouble,
visitors are not allowed to bring in even
the tiniest canine pet.
The room was beautiful with greenery,
red begonias and marigold, and per-
simmons glowed as a border for at least
one table. Lady Isaacs (all in black)
in her opening speech showered words
of praise on the society for the work
it is doing. The Poynter lady, in respond-
ing, paid a tribute to the imagination and
feeling possessed by the sex —both neces-
sary ingredients in the making of a
worth-while artist. Miss Ethel Stephens
blamed small flats and lack of wall space
for the small number of pictures that are
bought.
Artist Mary E. Soady has a flair for
dressing ; she was all Persian red. Her
hat, which sat straight on the head, had no
crown to speak of, but the brim was wide
and dipped in the front. Doone’s prin-
cipal, Jean Cheriton, in brown, had a
couple of attractive young things with
her. Mrs. George Earp brought a nice
daughter-in-law to keep her company,
and Helen Scobie, in her favorite green,
divided her attention between the pic-
tures on the walls and her friends in the
room.
Junior Red Crossers swarmed into the
Town Hall on Friday. They piled them-
selves on the organ loft, they filled the
galleries, they sat on chairs and lined
the pathway for the thousand of their
members who took part in the pageant.
The youngsters entered with spirit into
the dressing-up. The tiny ones came as
koalas; there were flowers and birds,
fairy-tale characters, Victorian ladies and
Dutch girls ; Island girls with hibiscus-
wreathed hips and heads swayed down
the room. Each group had its admirers,
but the loudest hand was given to the
J.R.C. Arch of Friendship, formed by
white-clad girls holding aloft half hoops
all red and white, under which small
J.R.Cs. passed. This finished the show
and at the same time loosened four thou-
sand tongues. Even those on the dais
couldn’t hear what Minister for Educa-
tion Drummond was saying, and he soon
gave up trying to speak. The Junior
Red Crossers had beaten him. Boss of
the Art Gallery Jimmy McDonald and
C. W. Bostock were left to worry over
the prize-awarding.
In the vestibule on show were stacks
of garments, woollen jumpers, cardigans,
scarves and caps in the most attractive
colorings ; there were shirts and pyjamas,
dresses and underclothing, all beautifully
made by the industrious of the Junior
Red Crossers for the children of sick and
disabled soldiers. Fascinating to oldsters
as well as youngsters were the knitted
penguin, the long-eared rabbit, the
cuddlesome cats, dogs and koala bears.
Even as this Letter is getting into its
pink overall, Horace Stevens as Elijah,
with 'the Sydney Philharmonic behind
him, is making good his claim as an
oratorio singer. Despite the weather,
Thursday and Saturday brought well-
dressed crowds to the Pouishnoff-Stevens
concerts at the civic fastness. Lady
Isaacs came on the first night; her black,
gold and green chiffons were served with
ivory lace sleeves and yoke, both edged
with fur. With her was Joan Gifford,
whose pink floral chiffons were glimpsed
under a mink coat as the v.-r. party left
the artists’ room. Mrs. W. E. G. Steele
(up from Melbourne for the season) did
brother Horace proud in grey georgettes
garnished with luscious ostrich feathers.
Others who applauded loud and long
were Edna Dettmann in black chiffons,
Dr. and Mrs. Weihan in larkspur-blue
crepes, Lute Drummond in maize satins,
the Marr Thompson couple, the De
Cairos Regos (she in wine taffetas), Dr.
C. Edgar Ford (he’s the visiting Trinity
College examiner) and the Kelso King
lady in wine-red georgettes.
Both artists are grey ; Horace Stevens’s
head reminds one of those seen on old
Roman coins, but minus the laurel
wreath. You feel that he would be
oratorical in manner until you see the
twinkle in his eye. His English is beauti-
*ful, speaking or singing ; not a consonant
is slurred. Pouishnoff is of smaller and
slimmer build, the type that would adorn
lace ruffles, a peruke, knee-breeches and
buckled shoes. Audiences are wondering
what his smile is like.
Among Rosemary Game’s proud pos-
sessions are a gold and green and pink
enamel badge bearing Doone’s motto,
Quisque labor omnium bono, and an
initialled leather book decorated with
pink native roses. These were given her
by her classmates at a good-bye party.
Her mother and brothers David and
Philip and Charles Gifford came along
to enjoy the fun, and so did the “finish-
ing girls” and the Alexander Gordon
lady. Principal Jean Cheriton was happy
in blue and silver chiffons.
A baby who runs not much risk of
going short of a rusk is the Ken. Arnotts’
son and heir. Mrs. Arnott was Elsie
May Taylor, of Bellevue Hill, and she
is stayihg with her parents at Alcooringa.

The advance guard of the Hunting-
fields has arrived. Lieut.-Col. Helme
Pott is to be controller of the household.
His wife is Queensland-born, like her
brother, Lord Huntingfield, and there’s
a schoolgirl daughter, Hermione. Cap-
tain Alan Lawrence is to be A.D.C. He’s
among friends, for he performed similar
duties for Lord Forster. On the same
boat came the beginnings of a staff, the
larger proportion of which will be
engaged here.
The opening of the “Glacie” was sup-
posed to be by invitation, but the crush
inside the building was like a football
scrum. People with skates fought their
way on to the ice to whirl among girls
in woolly jumpers or velvet dresses, young
men in anything at all, old men with
beards and little boys in short pants. No-
body fell down —there simply wasn’t
room. Dressed all in black were the
three champions. Jack Gordon executed
a brilliant pas seul, and Winkie
Thackeray and Dr. G. MacGillicuddy
waltzed gracefully. The Lord Mayor
and his Mayoress occupied a loge. In
the spinning crowd glimpses were caught
of what looked like Elaine and Hersey
Brookes, Joan Krcrouse, June Dyson and
Peggy Johnston.
Jewels will flash, trains will swish and
there’ll be a clink of medals at the
Legacy Club Ball on the 18th. It will
be Lord and Lady Huntingfield’s first
appearance at such a function, and it’s
Boatrace Night, so the Town Hall should
see something dazzling. On the same
evening Old Xa-vierians hold their frolic
at the Palais.
“. .. .Saturday no day at all” held no
qualms for Peggy Bruce and lan Sidney
White. Misfortune had come before-
hand, for Peggy had valuable jewellery
stolen the day before the wedding ; never-
theless she hadn’t a care in the world as
she emerged from St. John’s, Sorrento,
on her proud bridegroom’s arm. She
tQuched an unusual note with her
blossom-pink gown tied with a nutmeg
sash to match a saucy halo hat. L. A.
Gollin gave away his stepdaughter.
There were neither attendants nor formal
invitations, but Mr. and Mrs. Gollin wel-
comed crowds of well-wishers who
stormed the Kilvenny citadel. The
Cathay is the honeymoon sloop which
takes the young couple to England, where
their home i$ to be.
The Girl Guides’ Camp Fund should
have a substantial addition to its credit
through the tennis tournament run by
Elaine and Hersey Brookes. During the
early stages private courts were lent, the
finals being played in perfect weather
at the Norman Brookes’s. Afterwards
everybody drank cocktails, and Dr.
Geoff. Smith’s amateur band found an
outlet for its exuberance. Among guests
invited to the late-afternoon wind-up
were the T. Nettlefolds, Mr. and Mrs.
Angus Gibbs, Mrs. O’Hara Wood, the
John Shaws and the Douglas Carnegies.
Another money-getter for the Girl
Guides’ Camp was a market fair on
Saturday in Mrs. C. P. Broadhurst’s
garden in St. Kilda-road. Stalls of
vegetables, mountains of fruit, clotted
cream, preserves and cakes tempted
housewifely purses on the tennis court.
Morning- and afternoon-tea were procur-
able within the house and women without
cars were not threatened with bulging
parcels in the tram —for the Guides were
delivery-men within a certain radius. The
produce came from Lone Guides living
in the country. Elaine Moran, commis-
sioner for Lones, and ranger captain
Clara Broadhurst were amongst the
busiest.
Miss Florence Gregson, who for many
years has kept her skilful fingers on the
reins of the Returned Army Nurses’ Club,
has been forced through ill-health to dis-
continue her secretaryship. An affection-
ate good-bye was said by her colleagues
in Anzac House. The spokeswoman was
president Miss G. Wilson, who handed
the guest of honor a posy and a cheque.
Madame Lodewyckx spoke interest-
ingly on her travels at the International
Club’s afternoon function. Her lecture’
dealt with Italy and Mussolini’s good
roads; with Bavaria and the student
movement; with Ostend, fallen from
fashion and now favored by trippers,
and with Christmas in Stockholm.
There presents are handed from the
glittering tree, not by old friend
Santa, but by father, uncle or big
brother dressed as a gnome; and in-
stead of smoking plum pudding there is
Christmas rice cooked for hours in milk.
An attractive' guest was Daguren Kaaten,
just arrived by the Temeraire: a viva-
cious Norwegian with a smile as dazzling
as her complexion. She was with a
brunette couple: her sister-in-law, Mrs.
Kaaten, who is dark as Daguren is fair,
and Mrs. Sverre Lie. Mrs. Borhaven,
who has been in Australia 11 years, was
delighted to meet someone new with
whom she could talk Norwegian. Mrs.
Herbert Brookes and the new vice-presi-
dent, Mrs. Edward Dyason, made intro-
ductory speeches. Mrs. W. Mortill had
ermine knotted round her throat, and
Mrs. Segalis was in green.
The Society of Artists held its cus-
tomary at-home to celebrate its autumn
show. President Louis McCubbin en-
trusted architect Kingsley Henderson
with the opening, and Mr. Henderson
waxed poetical over the wealth of Aus-
tralian material which has not yet been
exploited in paint or in clay. Paul
Montford sauced his vote of thanks with
wit; he suggested that architects should
leave just a spot here and there for a
picture or a piece of statuary in their
giddy new buildings. He doesn’t play
golf, so he side-tracked the reproduction
in paint of a “peaceful mixed-foursome”
about which Mr. Henderson had become
eloquent. Dr. E. B. Heffernan was an
office-bearer with a white bow in his
buttonhole. Dr. Julian Smith’s short
pointed beard was noticed cruising
among the canvases. Mrs. F. S. Newell,
a regiment of ermine tails dangling from
her cape, brought daughter Lucy. Dora
Wilson and Peg Clarke lingered among
the impish griffins displayed with Mar-
guerite Calloway Mahood’s glazed
earthenware. Noticed also were Mrs.
G. Gulliver, Gretchen Leschkau and Dr.
Pern.
The carriage in which the Duke of
Gloucester will (or may) be transported
along Beaconsfield-parade and St. Kilda-
road is by no means a relic. Some new
upholstery and a bucket of paint will
make it as glittering a conveyance as it
was in Lord Hopetoun’s day. Four bay
horses are being educated in the art of
prancing on their toes, and by October
will be indifferent to cheering and
flag-waving crowds (should they be ex-
posed to them); every day saxophones
are being brayed in their ears and
newspapers flapped under their noses.
Liverymen will be chosen to fit the uni-
forms, for each suit ordered for the
Prince of Wales’s visit cost £4O.
The smooth, straight Geelong-road,
which is such a temptation to high-
powered cars, buzzed with traffic on the
wedding afternoon of Susie McKellar and
John Wallace. Dazzling sunshine crept
through the cloisters of Geelong Gram-
mar School chapel to pick up the gor-
geous reds in bridal bouquets of roses
and in the bridesmaids’ velvet gowns.
The bride, whom Ronald Esler pictures
herewith, is the second daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Thomas McKellar; the ’groom
is the second son of the J. Alston Wal-
laces of Boorabula (Deniliquin) and
South Yarra. In the wake of the bride’s
deep-parchment gown were six yards of
velvet train, entrusted to the small hands
of Alathea Fairbairn and Peter Guthrie.
Following them in a ruby-red cloud were
Audrey Poolman, Shirley Tolhurst, Betty
Ramsay and bride’s sister Heather, their
heads bound with thick upstanding twists
of velvet. Rejoicings were at the Barwon
Heads golfhouse, where guests con-
verged for the afternoon from as far
afield as the Western District.
With the long white beard of winter
just around the corner, the shops are
filled with exciting new snow clothes. The
winter sports expert is anxiously examin-
ing her gear for traces of hungry moth
and is doubtfully considering a new im-
ported garment which looks more like
baggy plus-fours than ordinary ski-ing
trousers. Enthusiasts of the Victorian Ski
Club have labored hard through damp
week-ends at Donna Buang making a
large main slide, a steep slide for turn-
ing practice, a jumping slide and a
“Mugs’ Alley” slide. This snowfield is
only 60 miles from Melbourne. If you’re
a novice and prefer to collect your
bruises and stiff muscles in gradual doses
you can practise when there’s no snow
on the grassy slopes at Eaglemont. The
Ski Club has arranged tuition classes
there’every Sunday afternoon. Grass ski-
ing was evolved here last year.
For her wedding Barbara Elvin trailed
lovely old Limerick lace, worn by mother
on her marriage day, and by elder sisters
Mrs. Peter Strickland, of Toowoomba,
and Mrs. Alan Holmes on theirs. The
veil rested upon a tulle foundation and a
satin train which ran out from a sim-
plicity garment with demure
long sleeves. Waiting in Melbourne
Grammar School chapel was a ’groom
with the good old Scottish name of lan
Malcolm McKay Gilruth.
A Broothorn portrait of Wyn Fraser,
who has returned from England with
some new ideas of ramming home points
in contract bridge. The important hints
are scattered throughout bridge playlets
acted by Mrs. Frank Harvey and Mr.
Fraser, allowed to soak in during an
interlude for tea, and finally put into
practice with an hour’s play. Mr. Fraser
captained an “A” team in the bridge
pennants. He speaks on his favorite sub-
ject over the air and through the medium
of the newspapers.
Melbourne scooped up both prizes for
Australia in the world contract bridge
tourney. Sixteen hands played in dupli-
cate were sent sealed from the U.S.A.,
and the players’ scores were returned
there for examination. Congratulatory
letters in the U.S.A. mail announced the
result. The north-south trophy goes to
R. H. Keon-Cohen and Dr. Bowen
Allen ; the east-west one to Mr. and Mrs.
Jack.
Melbourne Town Hall was filled with
magic for the Radio Show. Wireless sets
get smaller and smaller ; objects the size
of a loaf of bread claim inter-State recep-
tion. Above a map studded with twink-
ling radio-station towers, voices spoke
from Paris and London ; another instru-
ment illustrated the voice by flashes of
light; and the secrets of the automatic
telephone were there to. be probed by
the mechanically minded. A few people
forgot that free inter-State telephone calls
of one-minute duration were broadcast
and messages of affection burst into the
hall through a loudspeaker. Flappers
made a dash upstairs to the pashometer.
So far there haven’t been any violent Mae
West vibrations to put the thing out of
action ; but if you can register 90 units
of personality you are assured of a scin-
tillating career. Broken hearts will lie
in your wake and passionate swains will
stab one another for the sake of your
smile.
Vivian Wilson has arrived in Australia
on a visit to her father, Captain Aubyn
Wilson, of Yarraberb, Raywood. Vivian
has lived in England and Scotland since
her schooldays abroad.
Phyllis Balfour has returned from a
prolonged holiday in Asia. She looked
at dwarf trees, pagodas, fighting fish and
geishas in Nippon, and thence went to a
marvellous holiday in Hong Kong, where
there were picnics per launch and yacht
spiced up by having to keep an eye
skinned for pirates. Miss Balfour took
her riding togs and dashed about the foot
of the mountain on the shaggy ponies
used for fox-hunting.
Adelaide enjoys itself:
Debs, are popping up like the oyster in the
soup. Madame Krakowsky gave a dance at
the Liberal Hall, decorated with rich autumnal
flowers, for daughter Olga. The hostess looked
well in black chiffon velvet and a coronet of
brilliants; her daughter wore white satin and
a halo of lilies-of-the-valley; Kay Francis,
another deb., chose white net frilled on skirt
and bodice.
Recent debs, were well represented at this
affair. Their fancy in dress runs largely in
favor of big check taffetas, high in the neck;
one damsel even sported a Peter Pan collar.
The Stoddart twins introduced a new thing in
haloes —a plait of hair. Another large batch of
debs, will make their appearance at the Uni-
versity ball on June 27.
Angora tailored suits are being featured at
race 'meetings. They are very soft, but dis-
posed to stretch. At Cheltenham Mrs. A. V.
Benson was in a black cloth tailored coat col-
lared with brown fox fur, and a small black
felt hat. Mary Ross wore a brown Astrakhan
coat with her gr een Angora skirt, a green hat,
and gloves and shoes in the same bright shade.
Dr. and Mrs. Brian Swift returned from their
honeymoon by train. They left Victoria by car
but had a spill which put their motor out of
action.
Mrs. Roy Davidson, of Woodside, with her
three daughters is leaving by the Anchises to
spend a year abroad. Mr. Davidson will follow
them later on.
At the University Dance Club’s opening affair
in the refectory the wife of Dr. A. E. V.
Richardson was a striking figure in blue chiffon
velvet and silver. Shirley Burns-Cuming wore
green, coin-spotted with white, crepe de chine.
Trains are finding favor, but they need care-
ful handling. At a recent society function, an
imposing matron held hers aloft showing one
massive leg stockingless.
Mr. and Mrs. Per,cy Grainger are staying with
Mrs. George Aldridge (his aunt) at Palmer-
place, North Adelaide, while Percy gives re-
citals. Cousin Mrs. John H. Morish staged an
at-home in their honor at the Mount Osmond
Country Club.
Mrs. Charles Todd and sister-in-law Lorna
are passengers from England by the Ormonde.
The president of the Lyceum Club (Dr. Eleanor
Allen) is giving an at-home on Friday, at which
they will be guests.
Mr. Frank Downer gave a dinner party to
welcome back honeymooners Mr. and Mrs. Jack
Evans; it was held at his home at Marryatville.
Other guests were Mr. and Mrs. John H. Hill,
Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Milne, and Mr. and
Mrs. Hugh Davidson.
The president (Madame Krakowsky) and com-
mittee of the Woodlands Parents’ Association
entertained about 60 mothers at afternoon tea.
Songs were rendered by the pupils, and there
was a guessing competition. The Mawson lady
was named president for the coming year.
The Lady Symon Hall at the University was
decorated with autumn flowers when the com-
mittee and members of the University Women’s
Union entertained members of the staff, wives
of professors and lecturers and women life
members of the University Union. The guests
were received by Madeline Angel, president,
(rocked in fawn, worn with a small black hat
and a bow of the University ribbon at her
neck.
Perth has had a busy week:
It began with a bevy of belles rattling col-
lection boxes. In the evening there was a
searchlight tattoo. Billy Edwards conducted a
prelude of community singing to the accompani-
ment of the R.S.L. band; General Hob,bs took
the salute and inspected the guard of honor;
massed bands puffed out melodies; cyclists
pedalled their fastest; R.A.N.R. men tapped out
the sailors’ hornpipe; machine-guns demon-
strated ground defence against low-flying aero-
planes ; and Frank Collopy displayed
in an illuminated ’plane. After the R.A.A.,
Fremantle, had changed the guard in the old
style and the new, was a combined tab-
leau.
“The Merchant of Venice” awaited his ships
during a short season at His Majesty’s. It was a
Shakspeare Club presentation. Dozens of cour-
tiers and Venetian citizens flaunted gay apparel,
and strains of music were heard through many
of the scenes. Anita Fitz Gerald produced and
played a regal-looking Portia, whose gowns
were surpassingly rich. William Brown tried to
extract a pound of flesh from John le Tessier,
and Harold Malcolm, Glen Lilley, Fred Barlee,
Muriel Bird and Sylvia George made a fitting
complement to the cast.
A further am. dram, show was the Univer-
sity French Club’s “Topaze,” by Marcel Poig-
nol. The Refectory, Crawley, rang/with the
neatly.-turned, rapid dialogue, made clear and
vital by C. J. Horrocks’s versatile interpreta-
tion of the name part. Dorothy Fleming scored
a hit as Susy and Ralph Crosley did well as
Regio Castel-Benac.
Women’s Service Guild members celebrated
the 25th anniversary with a business meeting, a
luncheon and a dedication service. Upwards of
150 women marched past executive officers, who
held aloft betassled banners. President Mrs.
Rischbieth addressed the gathering, welcomed
ex-presidents (the James lady and Mrs. A. Mac-
donald) and pointed out the poignant wards
which were draped with crimson: “To-day we
light afresh our torchies from the flames set
alight by our great women pioneers.”
Joan Caris has an engagement-book crammed
with dates for farewell functions. With her
parents she is going to live in England; they
intend making a leisurely journey there through
the Eastern States and Panama.
Betty Drake Brockman came home frqm
holidaying in Adelaide and Melbourne and an-
nounced that Southern Persia and matrimony
were her next ports of call. He is Lisle Angelo
Pym, an Anglo-Persian Oil engineer.
From beyond Bass Strait:
Dorothy Wyly has gone from the staff of the
Launceston “Examiner” and “Weekly Courier”
to take up a broadcasting job on the mainland.
Mrs. D’Arcy Addison is back from her trip
abroad. Her sisters, Mrs. Brittain and Mrs.
Moser, hpstessed a party for her at the Queen
Mary Club.
The first snowfall of the season set the Ski
Club at work on its winter activities, which led
off with a dinner at Highfield Hall. H. R
Hutchison has been made a life member.
Country golf clubs are getting their greens
in order and holding opening functions. Ouse
club’s president and Mrs. W. T. Gellibrand tea'd
members and guests at the Derwent Bridge
Hotel, close to the links, after the mixed four-
somes had been played.
Olive Wilton’s first production for the Reper-
tory Soc. since she came back from London
was “Children in Uniform.” The powerful
play, with its morbidly psychological imputa-
tions, was ably handled. Junee Cornell gave
a harrowing study of the child Manuela, and
the show ran on oiled wheels as far as details
went.
The Lionel Oakleys were hosts at a gay party
to mark daughter Eunice’s twenty-first birthday.
Eighty-six guests sat down at dinner at the
Imperial, the tables arranged to form the letter
E. Pink-shaded lights and hanging baskets of
roses with pink streamers made attractive
decorations, and dancing in the lounge kept
things lively till late.
Tasmania revelled in the visit of Florence
Austral and John Amadio. Mayor and
Mayoress Wignall’s cheery reception for them
at the Town Hall synchronised with the diva’s
birthday, upon mention of which congratula-
tions fell thick and fast upon her.

ANT— SPOIL THE MOTOR
To a FinisH.
BY HENRY G. LAMOND.
I WANDERED along George-street, a
lonely figure. I had money in my
pocket and more in the bank. The
only words which had been addressed to
me in the past three days, had been recita-
tions from the bills of fare. • My replies
,had been monologues on the subject of
roast beef and boiled custard. ■ -
Suddenly I saw Lofty Peak. The last
time we had celebrated was after deliver-
ing a mob of Brunette bullocks at Gharle-
ville. From his altitude he had an un-
interrupted view of those about him. He
saw me as soon as I saw him.
We told each other how glad we were
to meet, and we adjourned; We each
shifted that foot off the brass rail and
rested the other one in its place while wc
told one another again. We looked for
a place in which we would not have to
change feet continuously. We found it;
a little room with a table in the middle,
and on the table a push-bell.
I took one chair. Lofty took two —he
sat on one and rested his long legs
on the other. We talked. We tapped
the bell at intervals. And each time the
girl entered with the mechanical smirk of
the professional dispenser of smiles Lofty
grinned hideously in response.
Lofty had acquired anew trade-mark
since last I had seen him. His face was
disfigured by a spur-shaped scar which
ran from the point of his cheek-bone
to his lower jaw. It stood out with start-
ling prominence.
“You’re lookin’ at this an’ wonderin’
how I got it,” Lofty guessed my thoughts,
his fingers running lightly over the scar.
“That’s one of th’ tracks of th’ trials of
matrimony. That come from me first
flutter in th’ web.”
• “I didn’t”
“An’ I ain’t. There ain’t any missus,
an’ she ain’t took to shyin’ no plates at
me. This is just a love-mark.”
“Tell me,” L commanded, pressing my
index-finger on the knob of the bell.
“It was this way,” Lofty commenced.
“I’d done a good trip on th’ roads. I
wanted a spell. I was chequed. I tossed
a penny to-see whether I’d go to Sydney
or stay at Uraweal. Th’ coin came down
favorin’ Sydney. After that, of course,
I decided to stay at th’ ’Weal. You know
what them little bush towns is like?
There’s a pub, an’ a store, an’ a police
station, an’ a post office, an’ about a
million goats. Some of ’em has a school.
Uraweal was right up to date in that
respeck. It has a school, an’ a person
in charge of it. Also, it’s got a widow
woman publicaness.
“That’s th’ joint what pushed Sydney
off th’ map for me spell. Barrin’ an odd
drunk or two in th’ horrors, it was so
quiet an’ dead it’s a wonder some live
sanitary inspector didn’t bury it for. sus-
pended animation. It suited me. Give
me somethin’ to growl about.”
“You haven’t mentioned the girl.”
“There wasn’t none. There was only
a couple of old gins an’ Mrs. Public-
house. She wasn’t no girl. She’d
buried two husbands an’ reared a family
from each of ’em. There was only a
lot of stray bucks.
“Apart from th’ floatin’ population,
there was a few what I used To amal-
gamate with. There was Greasy Scanland
the butcher, with th’ reputation of bein’
a bit of a stoush artist, VwithL a deejp
thirst that didn’t have no [bottom, an’-a
hand-hewn face with two ; piggy little
eyes. Him an’ me lifted a few at one
time, an’ another. • He was good drinkini’
company. • • • . •
“There was Wally Mclvor th’ police;-
man, an’. Jerry Thompson th’ postmaster.
Then there was th’-schoolie. He had a
nose like an insurance agent, an eye
like; an auctioneer, a voice like a Method-
ist parson, an’ a deep contempt for th,’
vulgar ways of men in their
native lair—meanin’ me anyth’ rest of us.
His name, in case I forget to mention
it, was Oliver Cumming. If anybody else
was shoutin’ he lived up to his name
all th’- time ; he was always coming.
- “One morning Mrs. Doolacher comes
out- all' bothered up. She’s th’ widow-
woman, what owns th’ pub.- ‘Now, ye
byes,’ says.she—an-VI knew she’s goin’ to
-smoodge- by the blarney- she puts in her
voice—‘ye’ll have-to behave -yer selves.
.1 do - have -word that my niece be corn-
in’ on.the next mail. It ain’t me niece
proper, bein’ a girl from me brother
Tim’s second wife what was a widow-
woman from County Clare. She’s on’y
three year out of th’ convent, an’ I want
ye boys to behave proper in front of a
young girl.’
“ ‘How old’s she, missus?’ a fellow
calls from th’ back of th’ bar.
“ ‘She’ll be twenty-two come th’ nine-
teenth of January. She was born th’
same year what me bye Jimmy got took
with dipthery.’
“ ‘ls she a cleanskin?’ another rooster
wants to know.
." “ ‘She’s neither married nor bespoke, if
that’s, what ye mean, Bob Ballard,’ Mrs.
Doolacher flashed back at him. ‘An'
she’s not for th’; likes o’ you, either, me
mahn! I’ll have ye know no relation of
mine, even if she" is once removed, is
goin’ to be annoyed by boozing bush-
rats;’ • ' ■'
' “ ‘Oh, o’ course,’ says Bob. ‘Fill ’em
up again,. Mrs. Public-house, an’ keep
th’ profits, as a present from Bob to th'
niece he' ain’t allowed to see.’
“Her name was Elsie Davener. She
come on th’ next mail-car. We was all
there to meet her. I had on a pair of
tweed trousers, a mercerised-silk shirt,
an’ one of'them furry felt hats with th’
bow at th’ back. There was half a dozen
more besides me, not countin’ th’ aunt..
We formed a guard of honor, or some-
thin’, when th’ car pulled up at th’ pub
steps. Mrs. Doolacher held a verandah
post; Greasy held' Bob to keep him
straight; I held me breath.
“She was tall an’ slim. She had grey
eyes an’ brown hair. She smiled quick
when she saw her aunt —it was all meant
for Mrs. Doolacher—but I got one
corner of it. An’ when she spoke a man
could sit an’ listen to it even if th’ dinner-
bell was ringing.
“Oily’s right there when th’ car stops.
He’s th’ little gentleman right from page
fifty-nine of th’ story-book. He holds
up his hand to assist th’ lady from th'
car; he passes her on to her aunt while
he busies himself about nothin’ at all.
He prances along an’ opens, th’ door for
’eni at th’ top of th’ steps. You’d think
he owns th’ town, with all th’ goatyards
thrown in as discount on cash.
“Greasy picks up her luggage an’
chases in with it, lettin’ ol’ Bob fall to
th’ ground. He was goin’ to be second
on th’ scene. But I made th’ biggest
hit of all. I grabbed th’ car-driver. I
invited him in for a drink. He did as
he was bid. While th’ others was doin’
their good deed I’d already done mine
for th’ day.
“Th’ barrier was lifted. Th’ race was
on. Oily wasn’t missin’ no tricks. There
was no kids kept in late after Elsie come.
Greasy took up th’ runnin’ too. We got
th’ top of th’ joint all th’ time th’ girl
was at th’ pub. I puts in a bit of a spurt.
Whenever th’ girl was listenin’ I used
to talk loud about th’ joys of married
life; about th’ flowers growin’ in th’
front yard, an’ th’ goats milked an’
yarded round th’ back. I even threw
in a couple of youngsters for good mea-
sure, an’ I always stowed me gear away
careful on. th’. end of th’ verandah after
I come back from drovin’.
“I was makin’ a hit. She got to callin’
me Lofty, an’ I addressed her as Elsie.
I had dead wood on th’ other two.
Greasy has to. attend to his business.
Oily has ,to put in an hour or two at th’
school every: now an’ again. I was spell-
in’ at th’ pub, with nothin’ to do, an’
givin’ a lifelike imitation of a gentleman
of leisure.
“But Oily got one in on me! He
yarded her in . th’ dinin’-room one day
while he read to her. I listened. It was
poetry; I could tell,that by th’ way Oily
used to catch his breath an’ by an odd
rhyme or two. But for all th’ sense I
got out of it he. might have been readin’
a sales catalogue backwards.
“ ‘What’s that stuff Oily’s makin’ a
noise about?’ I asks th’ missus.
“‘‘That do be poetry,’ says she. ‘lt
be th’ , poet Browning.’
“ 'Browning!’_ says I. ‘lt sounds like
it’s burnt, to me.’
.. “I sees I’ll have to shake meself along
a bit. I got a catalogue an’ sent away for
some clobber; C.O.D. If I was goin’ to
be beat, I’d-go down on me merits an’
with me colors flyin’. While I’m waitim
for, rhe'raiment things kept cornin’ an’
goin’. That is, Greasy come pretty regu-
lar an’ - me money is goin’ out just as
regular. „OHy wasn’t readin’ no more
poetry ah’ things' was just about on th’
level with all of us. Then I got me
parcel at th’ post office!
“I’ve heard' people say that two can
live as cheap, as; one. They may. After
I’d paid for them clothes th’ other half
of th! sketch' with me would need to
dress in wirid-wrappings, an’ I’d have to
live on hope pie. But it was worth it.
It’s one of them twisted-cord suits with an
invisible stripe running through it. I got
a green-an’-yellow tie, patent-leather
boots with sharp toes on ’em, a pink-
shaded silk shirt, an’ a silk handkerchief
with gold horseshoes on it. Oh, I was
goin’ th’ full distance!

<Dont leave
out the most
important word /
m
:S> :
Just add the one word “Cyclone” to your fencing order. With a “stroke
of the pen” you’ve made sure that your fences will be permanently stock-proof,
practically ever-lasting, free of maintenance and repairs. If you’re ever in doubt,
make these two tests :
THE “ RESILIENCE TEST ” (see sketch and arrows). After straining
to the correct tension, grasp the top and bottom wires firmly and bend them
towards each other, forcing the top wire down and the bottom wire up. You
won’t be able to make much impression on a “Cyclone” Ringlock fence, because
the upright wires are so strong and resilient that when you let go it will spring
back to its original position without distortion. “Cyclone” Ringlock is the fence
with backbone ; only HARD steel wire is used throughout.
THE “JOINT TEST.”—Grasp an up-
right wire above and below a joint (see
sketch), then wrench the upright first one way
and then the other. You'll never shift the
Ringlock joint. It’s rigid and immovable.
“Cyclone” Ringlock is the ONLY fence made
throughout of HARD steel wire. It is ab-
solutely unaffected by weather ; the longer
the ferce is erected the tighter the joints
become.
There is the correct type of “Cyclone”
Ringlock for every class of fencing (sheep,
lambs, cattle, horses, pigs). For paddock
subdivision—whether temporary or perman-
ent—“ Cyclone” Ring-lock fence stands alone.
“ CYCLONE ” is not a “ type ” of fence, but is
our registered trade mark, and can only be legally
applied to fencing manufactured by us.

“That night I uses th’ front entrance
to th’ pub when I goes up to pay me
respecks. Th’ coat pinches a bit under
th’ right armpit, an’ th’ boots squeezed
like a vyce. But I got a full-length
glimpse of meself in th’ mirror. Th’
pain was worth it.
“Oily’s there, makin’ himself agreeable,
an’ cacklin’ his silly laugh like a bantam
hen what’s laid a double-yolk egg. Old
Mother Doolacher reckoned I was a
credit to th’ district; th’ girl says she’s
pleased to see me ; Oily suggests a game
of cutthroat euchre. He wanted to keep
th’ girl in sight, I suppose. That’s why
he includes me in th’ deal.
“That just shows how far I’m gone.
There’s me, a full-grown man, standing
six-foot three in me heliotrope socks
with geraniums growin’ up th’ ankle,
an’ I’m playin' cutthroat euchre with
them new boots pinchin’ me toes! After
a bit, to ease me toes perhaps, I sends
one foot on a wanderin’ mission under
th’ table. There was no obstruction, an’
I sent it on a wider sweep. This time
I felt th’ toe of a little foot. I did with
it as was meant to be done. Somehow,
them new boots didn’t hurt so much then.
An,’ s’elp me goodness, I’ll be blistered if
th’ little foot didn’t slip from under mine,
rear up on its heel, an’ squeeze me toe
in return!
“I tell you, I lost three tricks straight
off after that. I was wonderin’ what was
goin’ to be th’ next move when th’ ol’
girl calls Elsie. She gets up an’ leaves
us. An’ when she’s gone my foot an’
th’ other foot is still playin’ squeezes
under th’ table!
“I’ll say this for Oily ; he was as quick
on th’ uptake as I was. It didn’t take him
no longer than it took me to figure out
whose foot he was playin’ with. ‘Come
an’ have a drink, Lofty,’ says he, makin’
a noise with his mouth for th’ sake of
sayin’ somethin’.
“Now, I don’t usually drink with them
fellows. But I needed it then. It wasn’t
a drink I was havin’ ; it was medicine.
1 took me drink for th’ good of me soul.
Also, I went an’ took off them boots.
“After that Greasy took up the runnin’
an’ makes th’ pace a cracker. I was.
hangin’ on, runnin’ wide, as it were, and
waitin’ me time. I mightn’t be th’ last
man ; but without things took a quick
shift I could see me last shillin’ bein’
paid out. I still had me clothes an’ a
bit of hope. That was nearly all I had.
“Then th’ school closed for th’ Christ-
mas holidays. Oily goes away south to
build up his shattered nerves. About ten
days later Mrs. Doolacher announces
that her niece is goin’ to th’ seaside to
repudiate an’ get strong for th’ heat
of th’ cornin’ summer. That leaves
on’y me an’ Greasy. I has to finance an’
recover me shattered fortunes. That
leaves on’y Greasy.
“I takes a contrac’ horse-breakin’ on
Yalbungra. I broke in them colts an’
me patent-leather boots at th’ same time.
“About th’ date Elsie’s expected back
1 goes again to Uraweal. I has money
in me pocket, an’ me feet is comfortable
in them boots.
“I let me horses go at th’ yard, an’
I’m swingin’ round th’ corner of th’ pub
when I runs into a group what’s discussin’
somethin’ which seems to be important.
Greasy’s got th’ chair.
“ ‘I wasn’t really after her,’ he was
sayin’. ‘I could ’a’ had her any time.
When I marries I want somethin’ that
ain’t cheap stuff like Elsie Davener.’
“ ‘Allow me to say,’ says I, steppin’
up an’ speak in’ polite, ‘that you’re a
stinkin’ liar, Greasy.’
“Th’ fellows form a ring quick, an’ me
an’ Greasy gets to it.
“I’d like to tell you about that fight.
I got a clippin’ here from a newspaper.
A commercial-traveller bloke wrote it an’
sent it to me. I cut it out. I won’t deal
with th’ first part; I’ll just give you
what’s wrote about th’ last round. It’s
headed ‘To a Finish.’ Listen to this:
“ ‘The swaying combatants came up
for the fifth round of the gory fray.
Lofty had a lacerated contusion on his
cheek, the result of a terrific collision
with Greasy’s head. The blood streamed
from the gaping wound and poured down
Lofty’s pale cheeks. Greasy was in little
better condition. His right optic was
swollen. His lips were split. He panted
in the extremity of his exhaustion. Only
the indomitable will of the men kept
them alive and on their feet. Like
Roman gladiators of old they advanced
to the attack.
“ ‘Greasy shuffled his feet and charged
like a rampant bull. Lofty countered
with a lancelike left. He followed his
advantage and caught Greasy off his
equilibrium. Like a giant refreshed he
charged, surging to victory. He ripped
and tore, sweeping like a fiend incarnate
in his fury on his road to victory. Greasy
went down and lay in a heap on the
ground. Lofty, the victor, stood over
his stricken foe. The fight was ended.
Lofty had won!’
“After that,” Lofty continued, folding
the cutting and putting it away in his
pocket-book, “there was only one thing
to be done. I done it.
“After we’d patched th’ cut with stick-
in’-plaster an’ curses, we went to th’ bar.
We’d just sunk th’ second when Jerry
Thompson come down with th’ mail.
Jerry always brought me my mail when
I was in th’ bar. It was too good a
chance for him to miss.
“There was a small parcel for me. I
opened it. It was a bit of cake about
so big. There was a white card. It had
bells, an’ horseshoes, an’ hearts, an’ bow-
knots, an’ flowers, an’ little naked angels
all round th’ edges. In th’ middle was
a couple of names. Th’ top one was
Oliver Welbeck Cumming. Th’ bottom
one was Elspeth Elizabeth Davener. Th’
Davener was crossed out, an’ written
over it was Cumming. I looked at th’
card. I could feel th’ others lookin’ at
me.
“A man shows his breedin’ by th’ way
he stands up to adversity. I got breedin’.
‘Fill ’em up again, Mrs. Public-house,’
says I. ‘We’ll drink good luck to th’
bride. Here’s to Mr. an’ Mrs. Cumming.
“Just then Greasy an’ his picker-up
come in. ‘Fill ’em up, Greasy,’ says I.
‘We’re drinkin’ to th’ happy pair.
Here. What d’you think of that? Play
a joker to that if you can,’ says I, flippin’
th’ weddin’ card across in front of him.
“ ‘That!’ Greasy snorts. ‘That’s nothin’.
We all knew that. Here’s th’ joker to
that trick.’ s
“Greasy reaches across for th’ paper
what come in th’ last mail. He turns
it over and shows me th’ announcement
of th’ weddin’ in th’ column next to th’
Births.
“An’ that’s that,” Lofty concluded. “I
left Uraweal without waitin’ for th’
happy pair to come back to us. That
was how I took a flutter an’ got this
scar. But I ain’t finished yet. I’ve still
got that suit an’ them sharp-pointed
boots. I’m goin’ to give it a fly in town
now.
“Did you notice that barmaid when she
served us? Did you see her smile when
she took th’ order. I’m half-on with
her, I think. You tap that bell now.
I’ll bet you th’ price of' th’ drinks that
she smiles at me again when she comes
in.”
Sonnet of Certainty.
There shall be no more waiting through the days
For any written word of his again
That tells of perils passed, of joy or pain.
There shall be no more watching through the
haze
For homing ships, with eager eyes astrain.
For long as sorrowful remembrance stays
The shining sweep of all the ocean ways
Is set between us two who loved in vain.
There shall be no more dreaming, when the
dusk
With brooding wings falls grey and com-
forting,
Of glory that the marching years might bring;
Instead, the dreams and hopes of two brief
years
Are folded in, and buried deep in tears,
Where memory stays with mignonette and
musk.

The Figurehead.
In a walled suburban garden,
Overhung by roses red,
Aged by time and worn by weather,
Stands a wooden figurehead.
Known to all the winds of heaven —
East and west, and north and south —
Tarnished are its golden tresses,
Pale the rose-hue of its mouth.
Yet so airy ’tis and lifelike —
Arms outthrust and hands apart—
That I feel ’twas surely carven
By some master of his art.
Moved by love of grace and beauty,
Shapely head and bust he curved—
Surely name and fame, known world-widej
He who wrought so well deserved.
One may see in poise and gesture
How he caught the spirit free
Of some light, sea-loving creature,
Born and nurtured by the sea.
And when carven was this image,
Gold of head and red of lip,
Sure the ship that wore and bore it
Must have been a stately ship.
Blest by winds, caressed by wavelets,
Must have been that ship, I vow,
With this shape of queen or fairy,
Or of goddess at its bow.
Loved of sailors, loved of captains,
Crews and captains of the past,
Many waters were its mirror,
Many tides its beauty glassed.
Now, at length, in this walled garden,
Where red roses climb and bend,
Sought and seen by few it moulders—
All its voyages at end.

The greatest possible
shaving comfort at the
lowest possible cost per
shave —that is what the
new Gillette Slotted Blade
means to you. The extra
hardness of the steel used
enables these blades not
only to take an edge
incomparably keen but
also to ‘hold’ that edge
for many more shaves
than an ordinary blade
can give you. Result —
much better shaves and
more shaves per penny.

££TTASN’T she shown up yet?”
That waspish, damn-your-
eyes note being in Tilda’s voice,
Cliff made no reply. The summer-morn-
ing haze over the ’Loo cut ten years off
a man’s age; three storeys below, the
pavement of Hulk-street was a road —
well, a road leading anywhere.... Clif-
ford Mimbles, a youngster with a nice
taste in suitings and haberdashery—you
could see him walking along it any
minute now, 20 years ago
“Why don’t you put a rose —or a cauli-
flower —in your ear an’ go an’ sit on the
step? You couldn’t miss her then.”
Gingering up, Tilda was. But let her
ride. Tilda wasn’t everything, if she
thought she was. He continued to watch
Hulk-street and the doorway of the
building.
“You know, you’re slow, Cliff —that’s
what you are.” The wasp note had in-
tensified. “What’s the good of giving
yerself a pain in the neck —which makes
two of you—trying to see your own door-
way from a third-floor window when
you could hop downstairs and catch her,
casual, as she goes out? You’re all
dressed up an’ shaved an’ powdered an’
stinkin’ lovely. What 1 mean is, why
waste it?”
Tilda poured the boiling water in and
slammed the lid on the teapot. “It isn’t
as if you were a boy,” she added. “Be-
sides, you never know the luck —she
might bust her bag of apples again, like
yesterday, and you could put in another
four minutes pickin’ ’em up while you
cooed to her.”
Cliff brought his head in and stood
upright, a symphony in blue, fading from
dark serge through powder-blue socks and
shirt to skyey handkerchief and tie. He
didn’t look a day over 40. “Timed me,
did yer?” he said.
“Just the four minutes,” she told him
heartily. “I thought it was good. The
way you dropped two while you picked
up one”
“You got it wrong,” he interrupted.
“She —she’s not that kind.” Lost in
thought, he stirred his tea. “Not that
kind,” he repeated.
“No?” Tilda laughed. “Be your age,”
she mocked. “She’s got a baby-face”—
she ticked the items on her finger—“ash-
blond hair, a voice like the doves in the
Gardens, a coupler blue eyes like soup-
plates and a coupler rooms in Dad Eldon’s
flats in Hulk-street”
“I know,” he interrupted again. “But
you got it wrong”
“Got it wrong!" Her haggard eyes
stared at him. “I dunno what’s bitten
you,” she complained. “She comes here,
soft and sweet as a tune on the harp,
nobody knows where from”
“Noddy Farren brought her —you
know that. He —he had a bit o’ business
with her, an’ she wanted a place, and
he found her one.” Cliff bit his toast
thoughtfully; the anger in the room was
nothing to him. “She’s on some ramp,”
he added. “And she oughtn’t to be”... /
“Noddy Farren —robbery without
violence —the fastest sprinter in the game.
A bit o’ business with Noddy—•
that’s a hell of a reference, isn’t it?”
Cliff looked up, banishing his thoughts.
“You’re talking like a fool.”
But Tilda’s haggard gaze stormed
at him across the kitchen table. “Fool?
Me? And you breaking your neck every
morning for a fortnight to see a pink-
and-white sweetheart on the mat, so you
can sprint downstairs for a word and a
smile! Is it me that’s the fool?”
“You got it wrong,” he told her dog-
gedly. “Gimme another cup o’ tea. And
shut yer mouth.”
He went over to the window and
glanced down at the doorway. She was
late....
Turning, he was aware of a shadow,
a tall, thin shadow sumptuously dressed,
drifting in at the kitchen doorway. Be-
hind her, Rory Blitz looked sheepish and
half-asleep as usual.
“Hullo, Annie,” Cliff said to the
sumptuous shadow. He nodded to Rory.
Annie’s slow gaze travelled from Cliff
to Tilda. “Sultry, isn’t it?” she mur-
mured. “Stiff breeze before long, I
shouldn’t wonder. We found the door
open.” She drifted to Cliff’s chair and sat
down.
“He leaves it open,” Tilda told her.
“Saves him a split second in his sprint
downstairs to catch the sweetheart on
the mat.”
“Ada Lome?”
Tilda nodded. “Tea, Streamline?”
Streamline Annie shook her head.
“Not so good,” she said to Cliff; “ ‘king
of the underworld but devoted husband,
perfect home life’ —not so good, Cliff.”
Cliff turned his back on her and
crossed to the window again.
Annie fitted a cigarette into a six-
inch holder, pushed the case across to
Tilda, who shook her head. “No? Per-
haps you’re right. They’re stiff with
dope, thank God —an acre of poppies to
the packet.” Her hard, bitter eyes
watched Tilda a silent moment. “Cliff,”
she said.
He came back to the table. “Well?”
“What’s this sweetheart’s racket?”
He shrugged. “If any,” he said.
Streamline Annie’s eyes burned into
his. “Try again,” she counselled softly.
“What’s her racket?”
Cliff laughed. “Keep it for the Bloke,
Annie. Or the sergeant on duty. I don’t
know”
“Taking peanuts and chicken-broth
and monkeys-on-a-stick to old Colin,
who’s sick abed, of course,” Tilda told
them. “He says she’s an angel. What
makes you think she’s got a racket?”
“I wish she hadn’t,” Rory said sullenly.
“She —she oughtn’t to.”
Annie turned swiftly on him. “Little
daydreams,” she crooned. “Isn’t he the
pet for coming right out with something?
Why the hell oughtn’t she?” she de-
manded.
“Because she oughtn’t,” Rory insisted,
still sullenly, and dodging the glitter of
Annie’s merciless eyes. “A girl like that’s
got no right in the game.”
“No right in the game —because of
her baby-face? You fool, a face like
that’s enough to send her into the game.
If I had it, d’you think I’d be here in
the ’Loo with a lot of second-raters”
“Annie.” Cliff’s voice was quiet.
“Have you ever spoken to her?”
Tilda laughed. “Too right she has —
unless she’s spent the last fortnight under
her bed with the door locked. Regular
little ray of sunshine, your Baby-face;
a kind word for everyone.”
“Have you?” Cliff insisted, ignoring
Tilda.
“Yes.” Something of the glitter died
out of Annie’s eyes. “Yes —makes you
think of those calendars Marty’s so keen
on, doesn’t she? Feeding chickens, with
a sunbonnet on”
“Or in one of those little White caps,”
Rory broke in, “looking after kids, sick
kids. In a quiet place with grass round
it —and trees.” His sentimental gaze
wavered to Tilda, who snorted.
“Why not wings and a nice, clean
nightgown?” she snapped. “Cliff here’d
say his prayers to her any night.”
Cliff’s mouth hardened. “Rory’s right.
She shouldn’t be in the game. Specially
with a fool like Noddy—some time she’ll
fall down on it.”
“There’s jobs,” Rory reminded them.
“I got a sister in a job. In a flower-
shop.” He sighed.
“Look —I tell you what.” Tilda’s tone
was bright and smooth. “You three get
together and put it to her: ‘Give up this
life of crime, ’cos we just can’t bear it.
Come an’ feed chickens, wipe kids’ noses,
sell flowers, grow wings.’ Cliff’ll buy the
harp”
“Listen, Tilda. I told you you got it
wrong. / don’t want this tabby. Not
herself.” Cliff glanced at the window
and the haze over the ’Loo before he
looked hard at Tilda. “But she’s wrong
in this game. She’ll get hurt. Annie
sees that, and Rory”
“Yes, that’s right, Tilda,” Rory said
quickly, and Streamline Annie nodded,
her eyes thoughtful.
Another shadow darkened the door-
way, heralded by a diffident cough.
“May we intrude?”
A little parson stood there, hat in hand,
very earnest, complete with Adam’s apple
and smile.
“We found the door open.” The smile
went round the startled company as he
stood aside. Blushing, her blue eyes look-
ing down, her ash-blond hair an aureole,
the sweetheart was with him. “We came
to thank you, Ada and I.”
Smiling fitfully without mirth, Annie
crushed out her cigarette on the table.
The others were rigid.
“I’m Baxter, the new curate at St.
Bede’s, up the hill. I begin duty next
month, on our return from our honey-
moon.”
Tilda sat down suddenly. “Honey-
moon? Is she going to marry you?” she
faltered.
The little man beamed at her.
“Happily, yes. And I came to thank you
all for”
“But what the ” Tilda gulped and
reconstructed. “What was she doing liv-
ing here”

[an Banking
System
THE Australian Banking System is based on the
Scottish model of branch banking, which has
proved its strength and soundness over two
centuries.
"Branch Banking" consists of a few large banks
with many branches. Each of the nine big Aus-
tralian trading banks operates over the greater
part of the Commonwealth.
This system, which has enabled Australia to
weather the world depression better than most
countries, is in marked contrast to the banking
structure of the United States.
In that country there are thousands of purely local
banks, most of them very small. They operate in
very limited territories.
Thus they lack the flexibility of the Australian
system, which can effectively meet a financial set-
back in one part of the country from the resources
of more favoured areas. In Australia, deposits
lodged in well-established districts can be used to
finance production in less settled areas.
But more important still, the centralized control in
branch banking permits of the consolidation of
banking resources from all districts. The prudent
setting aside of large reserves by the Australian
trading banks in prosperous times has been the
major factor in maintaining financial stability dur-
ing the past four years.

“Aha!” Mr. Baxter was coy. “That
was a surprise for me! She wanted to
know her parish, to know and love her
people.” A flute-note was sounding in his
voice. “I had to go to Melbourne and
the dear child took the opportunity of
my absence to come and live with
you”
“Noddy.” Rory’s sullen eyes glared
suspiciously at him. “Noddy Farren—-
where’s he come in?”
On the instant Mr. Baxter’s voice was
a mask of grave charity. “Oh, well, our
friend Noddy made a mistake —his first
and last, I’m sure. And Ada happened
to —to discover him”
“He found my room for me here,” the
sweetheart softly interrupted. “I wanted
you to think he was a friend of mine—
as he is—so that I could come in as one
of yourselves.” Her smile flashed upon
them. “I’ve been happy with you,” she
added. “And I’ll never forget how kind
you all were.”
“Well, good people,” Mr. Baxter re-
gistered imminent departure, “we shall
meet again soon. Meantime, so many
thanks, so many”
The kitchen doorway was empty.
Cliff recovered first. His back to the
window and Hulk-street, he glared at
them. “Beat that!" he barked. “A
parson”
“A damn parson’s wife”.... Rory’s
cheated eyes stared into space. “Yer
couldn’t beat it.”
Streamline Annie groped for her
cigarette-case. “Sweetheart?” she mut-
tered. “Of all the double-crossing little
swine”
But Tilda’s happy, damn-your-eyes
laugh rose on a full tide, filling the room.
DAN AND UNCLE AT LOSSBERG’S.
BY STEELE RUDD.
44\T°W come und I show you der
clothes to mend und patch,”
Mrs. Lossberg said to Uncle.
Uncle, striving in vain to explain that
he wasn’t an expert with the needle, so
that she mightn’t expect too much from
him, followed her through the house to
her “vork blace” —a bare little room at
the back wfcere a pine table, a few dis-
carded chairs and some shelving com-
prised the sole fittings. On the floor
in one corner cosily lay a black cat with
several half-grown kittens, and in the
centre slumbered a fat, lazy, long-lipped
old bulldog.
“Come righd in, mein frien’,” said the
lady assuringly. “Bully, he not bite. You
sit on the shair und I show you.”
Uncle sat, but kept his eyes roaming
restlessly over the slumbering canine.
“Oh, he can bite no one no more,”
she reassured, and, bending down and
patting the brute, opened his mouth and
disclosed a pair of toothless jaws.
Uncle gained confidence, then gave all
his attention to Mrs. Lossberg. She
tossed the damaged garments about.
“Dis vone,” she explained, holding up
a blue shirt with a huge rent in the front
of it, “vas belong Oscar. He tear it in
der barb-wire fence.”
Looking at the shape and extent of
the rent in it, Uncle began to feel con-
cerned.
“You mend him first,” Mrs. Lossberg
went on, putting the shirt aside and
selecting the next most important article,
“because Oscar he vant it to-morrow
for church.”
“To-morrow,” Uncle repeated absent-
mindedly.
“Und here is a deeferent vone,” Mrs.
Lossberg laughed, shaking out a pair
of modest calico bloomers. There was
a large, gaping hole in the rear of them.
“Selina, she ride on der merry-cock-
horse at der school, und vear eferyt’ing
through and through.” She shook her
head again and frowned as she eyed the
garment. “A patch dey vill vant, und I
get you some calico der same to match.”
Next came a pair of stout dungarees.
They were the property of Carl Loss-
berg himself, butcher and selector, and
were torn in three different places in
three different ways.
“Efery time I mend t’ose pants,” de-
clared Mrs. Lossberg, “he tear dem yust
so bad again.”
“They’re hardly worth mending, are
they?” Uncle suggested.
But the good frau disagreed. “No,
no,” she said, “dey moost be mended.
Carl can’t go aboud mit nodding on. Dis
blace not like der big city. You steetch
der legs, mein frien’, und pud der patch
on der pehind. Dot vill make dem do
him vonce more.”
“He wants a new pair, I reckon,”
Uncle suggested timidly.
“No, no! And Ya, too, maybe,”
suggested Mrs. Lossberg, with a smile
this time, “but vhere der money come
from to buy in der bad time?”
Uncle blinked gloomily.
“So here, now,” proceeded the lady,
“is der needle und threads fo’ you, und
der patch-pieces to match, und I leaf
you to vork for a leedle vhile.”
Smiling herself out, she left to attend
to other affairs, adding as she departed,
“I leaf you der door open. Bully und
der pussies might vant to valk aboud
already.”
“She wants this done first,” sighed
Uncle, spreading Oscar’s blue shirt across
his knees as he sat on the chair and
studied the shape of the rent. It looked
a difficult problem to him, while his
hand holding the needle trembled ner-
vously.
Then, dispensing with a patch, he
gathered the tattered angles of the rent
together and stitched them through and
through and over and under till they
formed a “rosette.” Oscar’s shirt was
thus made shorter in front and tight as
a glove acrdss the stomach.
The appearance of it, on completion,
surprised even Uncle himself. Holding
it up to view, he smiled in satisfaction
at his own handiwork. “When he’s wear-
in’ it,” he chuckled to himself, “people
will think it’s a war medal or a Order
of th’ Garter or somethin’.” As he
was viewing it a red Irish terrier
sauntered along the verandah and stood
at the door looking in curiously. To
Uncle himself the terrier paid little atten-
tion. The slumbering old bulldog didn’t
attract him much either. He seemed to
know him as a sleepy nonentity.
But when his eyes fell on the black cat
and her brood huddled together in the
furthest corner of the room he pricked
his ears, stiffened the muscles of his back
and moved his stumpy tail menacingly.
He even whimpered a war-cry.
“What'are you after?” Uncle, noticing
the dog’s attitude, said. 1 “Gerrout!”
Uncle didn’t like Irish terriers. Uncle
was English.
Just then Pussy, unconscious of what
was about to happen, stretched out her
limbs and yawned. The Irish terrier
made a rush for her. But in making a
leap to clear the bulldog, who was in
his path, he met with trouble. Bully,
roused by a cry of protest from Uncle,
rose to his feet as the terrier made his
leap. They fouled. Irish thought Bully
meant fight and, forgetting the cat, went
for him tooth and nail Bully forgetting he
wasn’t young any more, put all the weight
and noise he could into the brawl. They
rolled over the floor, rolled over them-
selves, rolled against the cat and her pro-
geny. Pussy, amazed, stood up to them,
spat and struck and clawed both with a
right and left, then off out the door for
dear life she went. Her progeny, with
their backs humped, also spat at the
gurgling, struggling dogs, then ske-
daddled in her wake.
The fight rolled on. The terrier, with
teeth like tusks, had Bully by the throat.
Bully threw him off and seized him by
the back of the neck with his gums, and
made a great noise shaking him. But
Irish turned on his back like a shark
and snatched a tongue-grip. The yells
of the other then were appalling.
Uncle, who had been waiting his chance,
interposed. He hobbled round the
“scrum” and aimed kicks at the “red
rebel” and called upon him to “let go.”
The rebel let go the tongue-grip and,
finding his feet, rushed at Uncle and bit
him on the foot.
Uncle limped groaning to the table.
Bully closed with the terrier again.
Uncle armed himself with Oscar’s blue
shirt and, re-entering the arena, flayed
them right and left. They became tangled
in the shirt, and he lost his grip of it.
He snatched up Selina’s bloomers and,
puffing and wheezing, flayed the peace-
breakers more and more. They blind-
folded themselves in the bloomers, and
still the fight rolled on. The dogs, locked
together, reared up under the pine table
that held the pile of clothes to be mended
and knocked it over, then fought amongst
all the garments, and made the holes in
them a lot bigger, and smeared them
with blood and froth.
At this stage Mrs. Lossberg returned.
She threw her hands over her head.
“Mein Gott!” she cried. “Der ruin!”
eyeing the scattered garments.
Recognising the Irish terrier as an old
transgressor, she stamped and shrieked
vengeance on him. “Dat Irisher! Dat
wretch! He make der mischief,” she

concluded. “Hit him! Stob him, vhy
don’ you!” And, seizing a house-broom
that was near the door, she struck and
jabbed the rebel whenever he was on
top, at the same time shrieking for help
at the top of her voice. She was rein-
forced by a contingent of young Loss-
bergs. They armed themselves with any-
thing available, including the umbrella-
handle, and at the dogs they went, their
yells of command and delight giving
great variety to the fray.
The “Irisher,” feeling the odds were
now all against him, released his grip
of Bully’s paw, which was in a fair
way to be chewed right off, and
hurried out the door. The youngsters
pursued him boisterously.
“Der prute!” foamed Mrs. Lossberg
when peace was won, and Bully, smeared
in his own blood, crept into a corner to
let his punctured tongue hang out to air.
“He alvay come here to bite der pussies,
und vhy you let him fight mit Bully?”
Uncle made no attempt to explain.
His fit of coughing got worse.
Mrs. Lossberg turned to Bully.
“Poor Bully,” she sympathised. “Vhy
you fight mit dot red Irisher?”
“He couldn’t—very—well—help it,”
Uncle, recovering, started to explain.
But just then the young Lossbergs mostly
came running in again, and Selina,
recognising her bloomers on the floor,
cried: “Oh, mother, look at them!” and,
raising the tattered things, pulled a long
face over them.
Mrs. Lossberg, staring indictingly at
Uncle, pulled a long face, too.
Uncle blinked humbly, but had no
defence to offer.
Another pounced on the remains of
Oscar’s blue shirt and held them up with
a grin. He indicated the “rosette,” at
which the others all laughed loud —all
except Mrs. Lossberg and Uncle. Mrs.
Lossberg stared again at Uncle.
“Thought you told me you vas a
dailor?” she sneered. “Or der son of a
dailor —vitch vas it?”
“Me?” Uncle coughed more to gain
time. “I never was a tailor —nor the son
of one, not that I know of.”
“You vas der son of a gun, may-
be,” and the lady started collecting the
scattered garments.
Henning, a fat youth, rushed in out of
breath.
“Mother! Mother!” he announced.
“Terry has gone in our room an’ is
lying on our bed on the clean quilt.”
“Terry” was the name by which the
Irish terrier was known to the young-
sters around.
“On der ped? Oh, dear!” Mrs.
Lossberg seized the broom again. “Dot
prute vant shokin’.”
The rest of the family rearmed them-
selves and followed their mother to the
boys’ room. .
Uncle, repeating “On the bed, is he?
On the bed?” followed with a leather
belt in his hand.
On the bed Terry was. Lying in the
centre of it, calm and comfortable, with
his head between his outstretched paws
and his eyes half-closed.
The youngsters gathered round the
bed and laughed.
“No, no, no ! Be carefu’, mein frien’,”
Mrs. Lossberg advised, restraining Uncle
from leading an attack. “Don’t strike.
He bite you head off. Dot fellow don’t
like der men. He love der shildren
though, und der vimmen. Let me—l
speak mit him first.”
Then Mrs. Lossberg began coaxing
the dog, while the youngsters broke into
more mirth.
“Vhat you do dere on der clean ped,
eh, you naughty fellow? Come off und
be a good puppy.” She extended her
hand towards him and snapped her
fingers affectionately.
A low, rumbling growl was the only
response.
It pleased the youngsters hugely, and
together they called “Terry! Terry!
Terry /” in fun.
Terry wagged his stump of a tail,
and, seeming to smile, rolled over on
his back and lay unseemly with all his
legs pointed to the ceiling.
More loud mirth from the youngsters.
“Now yust look at dot!” and Mrs.
Lossberg turned to Unple.
“Let me give him one with this,”
Uncle squeaked, and before the lady
could prevent him he flicked the
“Irisher” - on the bare belly with the
leather belt.
Once was enough. Irish was on his
feet in a flash. He sprang off the bed
right at Uncle’s stomach, and Uncle went
down backwards with Ireland on top of
him.
The youngsters, all squealing, went
down, too, but with excessive joy and
on top of each other. Mrs. Lossberg
made her way to the door. But Terry
didn’t disembowel Uncle; he merely
snatched a mouthful of his cotton shirt
from him and fled through the open
door.
“Vhy you strike him?” Mrs. Loss-
berg cried accusingly to Uncle as he stag-
gered to his feet holding a hand over his
abdomen. “You foolidge fellow.”
“I’d —sh -shoot him,” Uncle moaned ;
“and so—sh-should you.”
Suddenly the excitement took another
turn.
Oscar, the eldest boy, rushed in waving
a flush of banknotes that fluttered from
his fingers like toy flags.
“Where is father?” he cried. “Where
is he? I found a lot of money in the old
hut at the yard with the other man, his
mate” (pointing to Uncle) —“Dan you
call him.”
All became interested.
“You find it?” gasped his mother,
looking at the notes. “How much, my
poy?”
“Thirty-five pounds answered Oscar.
“And I found it all. But where is
father?”
“Did Dan find any?” Uncle asked
hopefully.
“No, I found all of it,” Oscar claimed
proudly, and off he went to search for
the absent parent.
“Oh, how vonderful!” Mrs. Lossberg
exulted; while the youngsters, pulling
curious faces, repeated “ Thirty-five
pound!”
But Uncle, shaking his head mourn-
fully, simply said: “Our rotten luck —
always missing the good things.”
“Never you min’, mein frien’,” Mrs.
Lossberg, now in splendid humor with
herself, consoled, “I bay you for der
sewin’ just like dere vas no dog-fight
at all.”
“That will be something, anyway,”
Uncle said gratefully.
Meanwhile Carl Lossberg himself,
after Oscar had told him of the find
and had given him the banknotes, has-
tened in the sulky to the killing-yard..
He returned even in greater haste, and
brought Dan with him. Talk about
excitement! And talk about money!
You’d think a hidden branch of the
Bank of England had been discovered.
Carl, after waving the bunch of bank-
notes, as Oscar had done, handed a
fiver of it to his wife. “Here, Rosie,”
he said, “give fife poun’ to Ungel, a
present for der sewin’ he do. Ve haf
tirty more left —see?” And he waved
the notes again.
“Dere, fife poun’ for der fine sewin’
you do. Dot is good bay.” And the
wife proudly passed the money to
Unc!e. Uncle was astonished.
“No, no!” he said. “What I did
wasn’t worth all that. Give it to him ’
—indicating Dan —“he was them when
the money was found ; I wasn’t.”
“You 'von’t dake it?” from Mrs. Loss-
berg.
Uncle walked away.
Dan overtook him and spoke hoarsely
into his ear.
“I told him to give it you —take it!”
he said ; “I’ve got twenty-five sovereigns
here. I found the plant first.” He rattled
the coins in his pockets. “But they don t
know it.”
Uncle hobbled back to Mrs. Lossberg.
“I think I’ll take it,” he said.
“I dink so, too,” she laughed, and
patted him on the shoulder.
To You, Stranger.
I would forget. What my heart remembers
Can only leave me a deep unrest.
Though eager eyes and pretence were sweeter,
A cool remark and a smile were best.
You played at love with a master’s methods.
I can’t complain, since you could not guess
You would touch to life with your ardent
murmurs
The need that I have for tenderness.
We waved. You went on your way. Ah!
Stranger,
’Tis sometimes sadder to smile than weep.
How could you know that your love, made
lightly, .
Awakened dreams that were best asleep?

Liners Back.
“Sydney’s Quay Advancement Association has
decided to advocate the return to Circular Quay cf
the overseas liners.’’ ■
I loved the ships that tied up at the Quayside,
The liners, and the old tramps black with
coal;
I used to stand and watch them ride at anchor
When wanderlust was tearing at my soul.
They took me off to smell the pungent spices—
An orange grove, a moon-mad tropic night;
To tom-toms throbbing in the native com-
pounds,
Where death is swift, and life is feather-
light ;
To magic songs that hum among the nut trees,
To dew-wet nights and ship-life gay and free.
To luscious fruits and flow’rs the hue of
passion—
Dear ships, dream-haunted, come back to the
Quay!

Bilious
Attacks
Most of us know the symptoms of
Biliousness that awful Head Dizzi-
ness —Furred Tongue—perhaps Vomit-
ing and a general feeling of Languor.
The liver is upset probably from over-
indulgence in rich food or drink or
eating the wrong type of food. Perhaps,
too, the liver is inclined to be sluggish.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have long
been recognised as the ideal remedy for
Biliousness. They stir the liver to healthy
action, cleanse and stimulate the bowels,
regulate the digestion and tone up the
system.

WORMS
A COMMON COMPLAINT WITH
CHILDREN—HOW TO TREAT IT.
Worms, by their movements and the inter-
ruption they offer to the contents of the
Bowels, generally occasion pain or uneasiness
in the Abdomen, sometimes spasmodic, some-
times gnawing and biting, and not infrequently
of a vague, indescribable character, and yet
very distressing. Sympathetic with this is a
sensation of itching at the Nostrils, producing
a disposition to pick the Nose, which is charac-
teristic of the affection. The Bowels are often
disordered, sometimes relaxed, as in Dysentery.
The appetite is exceedingly variable; in some
cases natural, in others deficient, craving or
depraved, one condition not infrequently alter-
nating with another. The Abdomen is often
hard, swollen, and tympanetic, the breath heavy
or foetid, and tongue furred, with disagreeable
taste, and a copious flow of saliva; swelling
of the upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils, and
disposition to grind the teeth during the sleep
are other characteristic symptoms. The effects,
however, often extend beyond the Alimentary
Canal, and various derangements of health
are experienced in consequence, either of the
direct irritation of the worms or of the dis-
ordered digestion which they occasion. Amongst
the most common of these are nervous affec-
tions, such as fretfulness, irritation of temper,
wakefulness or disposition to excessive sleep,
disturbed sleep, sudden starting out of sleep
as if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ments of the eyelids, temporary blindness and
deafness.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to recog-
nise the fact that their little ones have worms,
are suffering intense pain and distress, and are
practically irresponsible for the outbursts of
temper, restlessness and peevishness, and until
some more serious symptoms appear nothing is
done to alleviate the distress. The symptoms of
this disease are somewhat variable, but gener-
ally they are so characteristic that no mother
need have any doubts. The best proof of
worms is worms, and if the general conduct
of the child is such as to give the slightest
suspicion a careful watch will afford ample
proof.
A child who is affected with Thread Worms
will often appear to the eye to be in an
indifferent state of health. It becomes peevish
and irritable in its temper. Another point
to which the attention of mothers should be
specially directed is that the child is apt to
start in its sleep, its repose being in the way
of a disturbed nature.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are
a purely vegetable medicinal preparation com-
pounded oh a scientific principle for the
eradication of worms which infest the intes-
tines. They contain specific properties which
destroy the worms, but cause no injury to
the Stomach or Bowels, and do not weaken
the system. The pellets are prepared in the
form of a confection or lolly, have no dis-
agreeable taste or smell, but, on the contrary,
inspire children to take them as they would
an ordinary sweet.
