707 Gift Set
A chased gold finish, and the world’s most advanced
styling may be the reasons why the new 707 Gift Set has
enjoyed such tremendous success overseas. But there are
many more. The 707 pen cradles comfortably in the hand.
Has a convenient double-sided nib. It gives smooth, effort-
less writing. And fills two ways: Straight from the bottle
or with “Skrip” cartridges. The 707 ballpoint features
a smooth-flowing, long writing refill with stainless steel
tip. It just never skips. Exclusive ‘Safeguard’ clip auto-
matically retracts the point to do away forever with ink-
stained pockets. What more could you possibly ask for?
As a gift boxed ensemble just $22.70.
Individually: Pen $13.75. Ballpoint $8.95.

VANISHING HISTORY
KURNELL, in Botany Bay, where
Captain Cook landed, is, according to
reports, being rapidly eroded and may
vanish entirely. Local residents claim
this is the result of extensions to Mascot
Airport, which the Commonwealth
Department of Works is thrusting into
the bay. Perhaps the New South Wales
Premier, Mr. Askin, should substantiate
the story before he invites the Queen
here for the bi-centenary or they might
all find themselves in deep water.
JUXTAPOSITION
LAST WEEK “The Canberra Times,”
by one of those coincidences of position-
ing advertisements which can happen
to any of us, had a story headlined
“Kennedy’s death emphasises security
problem in United States” alongside
an ad headed “Hints for Shooters,” with
the following line, “Meet . . . who will
advise you on all your shooting
requirements.”
YOUNG LOOK
PETER D’ABBS, the new Press sec-
retary of Victoria’s aggressive Labor
Leader, Mr. Clyde Holding, told us
about his appointment over coffee in
Melbourne University’s mixed lounge.
A 24-year-old part-ti’me student, D’Abbs
combines the maturity of receding hair
and briar pipe with the traditional
student style of duffle coat, sitting-in,
and prominent work in the draft-
resistance movement.
His two years truck-driving in
Queensland and the Northern Territory
recall a type of student now rarely
found in the collar-and-tie universities.
He will only now add some practical
experience to his Political Science
course. He brings two years of jour-
nalism to his work at the State Parlia-
mentary offices.
Obviously already skilled as a PR
man, he reflected the interview frofti
himself to stress that his position, a
recently created job of research officer,
and the introduction of shadow Min-
isters were all part of a campaign by
Mr. Holding to build up a political
team. Mr. Holding had badgered the
State Government for the research
officer, but D’Abbs’ own salary of $30
a week will come from Party funds.
LEAR IN SHEEPSKIN
WITPI HIS PRODUCTION of “King
Lear” for Sydney’s Old Tote, Robin
Lovejoy has tried for a “timeless and
placeless quality — a feeling of pre-
history,” so the play’s young Japanese
designer, Yoshi Tosa, has attempted to
create his own period with a set of
simple architectural shape and costumes
in sheepskin and textured fabrics.
Tosa, who came to Sydney as a
tourist in 1961 and has been here ever
since, was granted a resident’s visa this
year and is hoping to stay indefinitely.
“I grew up in Tokyo, and Australia is a
much more comfortable place in which
to live. There you get into a routine
and there is no time to stop and think
about what you want to do.”
In Tokyo he had begun an art course,
which he continued at National Art
School in Sydney. Now the “King
Lear" commission has enabled him to
Tosa ... “Australia is comfortable”
give up his job with an advertising
agency to become a freelance designer.
“We are painting the sheepskins with
a special spray very expensive,” he
said. “But I wanted to show the charac-
ters of the three sisters with a color
scheme. The dark one, she is like
a tiger, the other one is foxy, and
Cordelia wears pale colors almost
white. I have tried to give the costumes
an animal quality primitive and, at
the same time, they are sexy ... I
hope.”
There are 75 costumes, and the set,
made up of free-standing monolithic
sculptures made to change under shift-
ing patterns of light, has been moulded,
rather painfully, by Tosa from chicken
wire.
“Very difficult it cuts your hands
as you work with it,” he said, looking
quite cheerful about it. “It’s sprayed
with plastic, so the whole set is white.
I’ve tried to unify the designs with the
director’s ideas. I think this is some-
thing Sydney theatre often lacks. The
director is saying something, and the
designs are saying something else.”
Although this is the first time Tosa
has worked on a Shakespearian play,
he has seen a lot of Shakespeare done
in Tokyo, where, he says, there are
three or four modern theatres regularly
staging everything from Ibsen to
Pinter.
“There are difficulties in translation,
of course, but they adapt the ancient
Japanese language to Shakespeare to
get the right nuance. There’s a Festival
of Shakespeare and a lot of foreign
theatre companies come to Japan. I
saw the Moscow Art Theatre do ‘The
Three Sisters’ and ‘The Cherry
Orchard,’ and although it was in
Russian it was still fascinating because
we could appreciate the visual and the
movement. So much of our traditional
theatre is visual, you see.”
INSURING A GOOD FUTURE
VMOST private schools are bulging
at their ivy-clad seams. Intense com-
petition among parents to place their
children at a “good school” means
enrolment lists are rushed as soon as
they open.
Many parents still wait until they
actually have a child and the ink on -
the birth certificate is dry before speed-
ing off an application, often to as many
as three schools. The pressure is on
boys’ and girls’ schools alike, and
parents who fail to think at least ten
years ahead have only the slimmest
chance of securing for their offspring
the cachet of being an old boy or old
girl of any of the leading independent
or church schools.
The enrolment list for the first year
of secondary school in 1980, which
opened recently at Presbyterian Ladies’
College, Pymble, Sydney, has been
filling fast with the names of children
now necessarily under seven months.

St. Ignatius’, Riverview, the Rector,
Father Jordan, summed up the situation
this way: “There are already more
bookings than we take in a year for
every year up to 1978. Next year we
have 203 applying for 60 places for
boarders, and 142 applying for 50
places for day boys. There are approxi-
mately three applying for every place
and if we were to accept all applica-
tions we would have a roll-call of well
over 2000 in six years, compared with
the present 700. Yet we are fairly small
by Greater Public Schools standards in
Sydney.”
Compared with schools more than
100 years old, such as Newington and
King’s, which have fifth-generation
pupils, Trinity, established in 1913, is
a “new boy” (though Cranbrook, 1918,
and Knox, 1924, are younger). Trinity,
which started in a rectory at Dulwich
Hill with 16 pupils, has seen its roll-
call grow to 930 today, and it has boys
booked in up to 1980, even though its
fees are among the top boarders
$420 a term, day, $lBO.
“Most of the schools have grown
from small beginnings,” said Trinity’s
headmaster, Mr. J. Wilson Hogg, “and
though the demand for places shows
the need for new schools, in my opinion
it is extremely doubtful that we shall
see them. Nowadays you could not
begin a school in a rectory. Take land
for a start. We are only six miles from
the G.P.O. and have 17 acres, but you
could not conceive of a school being
opened so near to the city today with
that amount of property. Yet schools
have to be located where pupils can get
to them.”
The only solution seems to be a
stop-gap one of expansion and most
schools have expanded. Trinity has a
large building program to allow it to
take in an extra 70 or 80 boys
“important to us, but a drop in the
bucket in relation to the whole pic-
ture,” Mr. Hogg admitted. “But you
can’t go on and on with expansion
without risk to the character of our
schools. When a school gets to the
stage where the headmaster has diffi-
culty in knowing all his boys, then
it is getting too big. A school of the size
of Scotch College in Melbourne, with
1600 boys, is enormous. There is no
doubt about it the ideal enrolment
is 500, but economic pressures have
driven the schools away from the
ideal.”
For many parents an old-school tie
for their children is a noose of debt
around their own necks. Schools don’t
like to discuss bad debts, and, if they
admit their existence at all, tend to
refer to them in terms such as “mini-
mal.”
However, Mr. H. Abbott, assistant
to the headmaster of King’s, Sydney’s
oldest GPS, was franker. “So many
parents came to us asking whether
something could be done to ease the
burden by spreading fees payments over
a greater period and the requests were
so persistent that we realised we had
to do something. We looked into a
number of possibilities and finally

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
worked out with .a life-assurance com-
pany the scheme we now recommend
to the parents of our pupils,” he
explained.
“We advise taking out six assurance
policies, one to mature in each year of
secondary schooling. The premiums are
tax deductible, Dad pays out only a
couple of hundred dollars a year, and
by the time the boy is ready to come
to us the first policy matures for, say,
$1203” (King’s annual fee for
boarders).
“A father is still able to claim educa-
tion expenses up to $3OO a year, so he
gets a double taxation benefit. Under
the scheme we worked out with the
MLC there is provision, in the event
of death or serious disablement of the
father, for a child to be educated at
the chosen school without payment of
further premiums.”
Mr. W. J. Reeves, of the MLC, who
worked with Mr. Abbott on the fees
plan and has a natural interest in seeing
it take off among other schools, believes
it will become generally accepted in
three to five years. But in his opinion
it will only ease parents’ problems
with fees. On the crowding for places
it will have the opposite effect, because
more parents will be able to afford to
send their children to private schools.
OUT AND ABOUT
Daphne Guinness
ALL YOU NEED IS
THE TIME, THE NERVE,
AND $5000
IT’S ALL tremendously, how can
Adrian put it, stimulating. Even if you
don’t bag a beast, the whole bit is so
fantastic, so utterly out of this world,
you know, seeing a leopard slithering up
a tree doesn’t sound much, but it is so
stimulating you return feeling mar-
vellous. And quite ready to take on
this awful old Sydney life again.
And everyone at this awful old Syd-
ney cocktail party is thinking, God, we
must go, it does rather put the old
skiing holiday in the shade. You know,
even the social writers are slapping
safari into their copy, like the way they
use hectic and mink and swinging and
mad and all the rest of their frantic
fun in-vocabulary. Everyone meeting
everyone on game parks in Africa. Driv-
ing through, actually, as the terminology.
And somewhere in the backs of their
minds is a hazy picture of Katharine
Hepburn swimming around in men’s
bush-jackets and drill trousers, with
Humphrey Bogart—or is it Cary Grant,
no, that fellow in that super film with
Marilyn Monroe, the one with big ears
who died —anyway, him, all sensual and
masculine, rescuing her from crocodile
and/or infested jungle. And afterward
they fall Into each other’s arms beneath
a full moon and drink hot toddies in
someone’s chicly decorated tent.
While it would be an exaggeration
to say that the whole of Sydney has
taken off en masse for the game parks of
Africa, it would be absolutely accurate
to say that some are indulging. And also
to say that travel agents are visualising
a pretty lucrative market on the horizon
provided (1) people have the dough,
(2) they’ll book a year in advance, and
(3) they’re not frightened. Because
safaris at the moment are full of
mystique.
How, for instance, should one dress?
Remembering Jackie Kennedy’s clump-
ing around Cambodia in those hideous
lace-up boots with holes in them. The
papers said that was the first sartorial
error she ever made. Actually, Double
Bay outfitter John Lane is passing his
rich customers on to Abercrombie and
Fitch in New York. They can drop off,
he says, on their way to Nairobi. Ker
Downey and Selby, the safari people in
Africa, issue a list that reads like an
army-supply store, you know, bulk
buying of woolly socks and boots, and
everything in jungle-green for camou-
flage, and someone else puts in heavy
black print that it is wise for ladies
to wear trousers at night. Travel agent
Dickie Keep, ju-hurst back with glorious
brown face and hands, took his garden-
ing togs. And a Lane and Yeldham
windcheater.
Then there are the asides, the tents,
the stretchers, the guns. Sydney’s
classiest gunstnith, Don Bennett his
shop’s got elk heads on the walls, car-
pets on the floor says it depends what
you’re gonna shoot, but all heavy guns
cost a packet, around $250 and
ammunition $25 to $lOO for 100 rounds.
In his opinion game-hunting is an aris-
tocratic occupation and one should
travel with one’s guns because one can’t
trust people these days. As for tents,
well, they come with built-in bathrooms
and built-in everything. One could
almost live in one for ever. Then one
needs Land-Rovers, a white hunter who
knows where the beasts are, he’ll cost
$4O a day (and then some, says D.
Keep), plus a spotter who does the
hunter’s dirty work. That is, finish off
the beasts who aren’t killed properly.
And he will cost something, too.
The thing is, so much money is
involved. Roughly $3OOO to $4OOO for
three weeks in India, with a tiger
guaranteed. In Africa, nothing guaran-
teed, around $5OOO for a month. And
once the beast is bagged it must be
stuffed, say £4O sterling for a lion skin.
Alan Atwill, who is terribly big in
tractors, says the place in the whole
world is London’s Roll and Ward. He’s
actually got quite a heap of stuffed
trophies coming over now, and what he
would like is a trophy room to put them
in. It’s not the killing that thrills him,
it’s the chase that leads up to it. You
know, getting the bbast into position
ready for curtains. Finis.
. . . Adrian is saying it’s pretty chic
to have an animal skin flung down on
one’s floors these days, and hasn’t every-
one noticed, though all this suffering
sounds horrible, that anyone with a

stuffed anything on their walls is rather
—um —one step ahead? It makes a
kind of talking-point feature to any
room. Oh, and by the way, the competi-
tion to get on a hunting safari is ter-
rific. It’s sort of rationed out in Africa,
on account of the game drain, and with
only 30 top-class white hunters in Kenya,
for instance, it’s first come first served.
People like Niarchos, Henry Ford, and
Rockefeller make it pretty tough f.or
everyone else. Terribly exclusive, you
know . . .

time to go, looking daggers at Adrian.

it was worth the effort just to see the
reticulated giraffe.

AH, TAKE THE CASH
AND LET
THE KUDOS GO
FOR LOVERS of clean sport, the
television program “World Series
Tennis” has a novel and attractive
feature. In the tennis matches shown
on the screen, the scores are kept in
dollars. I watched a dramatic contest
in which John Newcombe beat Cliff
Drysdale by $740 to $720, and the
interest was sustained to the last cent.
At times it looked as if the young
South African might be able to make
enough money to win. He would rush
to the net and smash the ball past
Newcombe for a beautiful $lO. But in
the long run the Australian’s superior
business sense carried the day. He
received a well-deserved bonus of $3OO
for his victory. There followed a pic-
turesque and moving little ceremony
when cheques were presented to the
contestants.
These televised tennis matches have
a special value for young players who
hope some day to break into the four-
figure class. By watching the stars in
action they learn that stroke-making
talent alone is not enough to ensure
success; it must be allied with the will
to earn. Players like Laver and Rose-
wall reach the top because they have
the big-money temperament. They can
put forth th'at little extra bit of effort
that is needed when $lOOO is at stake.
The monetary method of scoring, I
am glad to say, is an Australian inven-
tion. Nations with less commercial flair,
such as the U.S., are still giving the
results of tennis matches in games and
sets. It took robust Australian enterprise
to cut through these traditional trim-
mings and get down to the essentials.
We can hope that the system will be
extended to other sports.
It may be difficult at first to imbue
some players with the right spirit.
Cricket and football coaches should
impress on their men that individual
profits do not come first they are
playing for the financial benefit of the
team as a whole. Inspirational songs
and poems may be helpful, such as
It’s not for the sake of a ribboned
coat,
Or the selfish hope of a season’s fame,
But his captain’s hand on his shoulder
smote:
“The jackpot’s hanging on this game!”
An appealing aspect of “World Series
Tennis” is the flow of information from
the commentators. Soundly trained in
accountancy, they make rapid and
accurate reports: “That volley by Cliff
Drysdale will bring his $4OO up on the
board.” “Newcombe’s backhand is
giving trouble it just lost him $2O,
less tax.” Observations of this kind
enable even unbusinesslike viewers to
grasp the fine points of the play.
Cricket commentators will need prac-
tice with figures to adapt themselves to
the new approach. But there should
soon be nothing strange in hearing:
“Walters and Lawry are stealing a
cheeky $10,” or “England is eight for
£290 stg. and the tailenders are fight-
ing grimly for funds.” Test match scor-
ing will be done, no doubt, in the cur-
rency of the home side.
I talked to Rugby League adminis-
trator “Bumper” Jones about monetary
scoring for football. He said: “It’s a
splendid idea, and I believe it would
speed up the game. You won’t see for-
wards hanging on to the ball if they
have a chance to start a lucrative pass-
ing movement.”
Mr. Jones had a constructive sugges-
tion. “In these days of increasing finan-
cial sophistication.” he said, “I don’t
see why equities, bonds, and deben-
tures should not be used for scoring as
well as cash. Think of the excitement
in the grand final if a St. George
winger went over the line for a parcel
of shares in BHP. And what a stirring
scene after the match when the Gover-
nor presented the winning team with
their scrip!”
The value of the “World Series
Tennis” program, I believe, goes
beyond the sporting sphere. It sets a
new standard of frankness in recog-
nising the value of money. There have
been other moves in the same direc-
tion, such as Press reports that “singer
Arlene Derge has signed a $50,000 con-
tract in Las Vegas,” etc. But this TV
show brings the thrill of watching big
money actually being made. I would
like to see on-the-spot telecasts of
opera, for example: “This is the first
act of ‘La Boheme,’ and Madame
Simonetta Pizza with her sensitive ren-
dering of Mi chiamano Mimi has $2OO
on the board. At this stage tenor Richard
Worble is trailing her with $175 . . .”

I WORLD’S FINEST TROUSERS


Waiting for Trudeau
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
TO AUSTRALIANS it may seem at
first glance merely an example of the
Americanisation of Canada that the
Canadians have chosen as their Prime
Minister as much of a swinger as the
48-year-old Mr. Trudeau. This is not
so. Previous Canadian Prime Ministers
have been as humdrum as ours. (Just
look at Mr. Trudeau’s opponent.) Mr.
Trudeau’s success is as much of a
change to Canadians as it would be to
us.
It seems pretty likely that some day
we shall get our own Trudeau. If one
of our political parties w'as flexible
enough to produce him now' it would
seem more likely than not that the
Australian people would elect him (as
South Australians did their best to re-
elect Mr. Don Dunstan). But, as with
so many other matters in Australia,
the conservatism of their betters denies
the people the opportunity of display-
ing their potential.
It was, how-ever, no accident that it
was Canada rather than Australia that
has given political power to a man who
looks as if he is living in 1968. The
kind of crisis that exists in Canada as
to w'hat Canada is supposed to be (and
even whether it should continue to
exist) is enough to frighten any politi-
cal party into trying something new.
And the comparatively greater educa-
tion of Canadians, their more rapid
entry into the technological age, and
their greater accommodation to modern
cleverness may also have made it
easier.
What appeals about Mr. Trudeau is
not his policy both his concern with
national unity at home and with a
vague kind of internationalism abroad
are irrelevant to Australia’s special con-
cerns. It is his style. He seems to have
some brains of his own and to know'
how to use the brains of others; and he
has the manners of the age. He looks
as if he would be too good to be
mayor of the local council.
Australians are not yet adjusted to
open proclamation of the idea that in
braininess lies the key to the future. Yet
although braininess is not sufficient for
a realisation of the potential in the new
world that is coming up (w'hat is ever
sufficient for anything?) it is obviously
necessary. In the new' technique of
decision-making, not to be able to apply
trained intelligence will be to fail. Since
in the modern nation more decisions go
on in the government apparatuses than
in any other organisations, it is decisive
that governments should know how to
weigh alternatives and implement
decisions in a skilled w'ay. It is equally
important that governments should set
an example to others: by their own
practices they can help “modernise”
the rest of the community.
In some ways it is just as important
that political leadership should shed
the pomposities of the past. There is a
terrible hollowness about the perform-
ance of almost all of our present lead-
ing politicians and most of those who
are coming up behind them. Their
endless difficulties with their TV
images comes not from lack of tech-
nical tricks - most of them now end
up taking advice on their TV problems,
and look at the mess they continue to
make of it; it comes from the fact
that in a new age they don’t know-
how to behave. They lack the intellec-
tual capacity to conceptualise policy
and dramatise it, the open-heartedness
to speak to their countrymen, and that
sense of a future that can make new
sense of the present and of the past.
In their public dealings with each
other they can get by in the child’s
world of parliamentary fun and games
because nobody else is looking
but when they reveal themselves to
ordinary people they seem to rev-al
themselves as frauds. In America,
where a new' sense of style is more
openly in demand than it is here
(because it is in America that the new
styles are developing), it was the
tragedy of President Johnson that he
seemed old hat. He would probably
make a more effective and a more
liberal President than the contenders
for his succession: but he lost the
chance, because people wouldn’t believe
him. The reason, above all, why they
would not believe him was that he did
not seem to belong to the age.
It may seem odd to suggest that in
a democracy it might finally be only
the State that can raise those con-
spicuous virtues that give people a
new awareness of their condition. It
was Matthew Arnold w'ho made that
suggestion. To give this idea more
immediate reference, the American
Irving Kristol put it like this: “In a
democracy, if there is good democratic
leadership, the people are capable of
creating better than they know and
of truly appreciating this supra-popular
creation. Without Abraham Lincoln
and John F. Kennedy, the American
democracy would not only be far
poorer in its self-definition than it is
today -- it would be blissfully unaware
of its poverty. With them, and others
like them, one can discern a promise
and potentiality that is becoming (one
hopes) an integral part of American
democratic life.” Since Mr. Kristol,
when he wrote this, was trying to cheer
up an Australian, it is not irrelevant to
hope that, some time, our owm country’s
luck might extend to gaining such
political leadership for a w'hile.
Labor influences Gorton
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
FEDERAL PARLIAMENTARIANS
are still baffled about the possibility of
a general election this year. Some are
convinced there will be one, others are
equally sure there won’t.
Neither school of thought can be
completely confident. The answer is
locked up in the mind of John Gor-
ton, w'ho, as Prime Minister, alone has
the right and constitutional authority
to make a recommendation to the
Governor-General, Lord Casey, on this
subject. But the events of August 5,
w'hen the ALP Federal Executive
meets, could influence him profoundly.
While it is impossible to predict what
will happen in the ALP these days,
this meeting has the potential to pro-
duce further divisions w'ithin Labor’s
dissension-torn ranks.
The Harradine case could stoke a
fresh flare-up. Mr. R. B. Harradine is
the delegate to the ALP Federal Execu-
tive from the Tasmanian ALP, w'ho,
paraphrasing the w'ords of Labor
Leader Gough Whitlam, accused the
Victorian ALP of being under “sub-
stantial” Communist influence. Harra-
dine also suggested that, to prevent him
supporting any Whitlam-inspired moves
against the Victorian ALP, “friends of
the Communists” would move for his
ejection from the ALP Executive.
As it happened he was ejected on
the grounds that his charge insinuated
that there were “friends of the Com-
munists” on the ALP Federal Execu-
tive.
Harradine subsequently apologised
and withdrew those statements, which
could be interpreted as reflecting upon
Executive members. But he has not
withdrawn his charges against the Vic-
torian ALP branch. This is sticking
very much in the craw of the Left
Wing, which has a majority on the
Federal Executive. It is by no means
certain at this stage that Harradine
will be re-admitted on August 5 with-
out further trouble, despite his apology
to the Federal Executive. In fact, if
the tougher element in the Left Wing
gets its way, it is by no means cer-
tain that he will get in at all if he

persists in adhering to his claim, pat-
terned on Whitlam’s, that the Victorian
ALP is under a substantial external
and non-ALP influence.
Tasmania, where Australia’s last
Labor Government survives under the
Premiership of Eric Reece, appears
at this stage determined to back Har-
radine. Reece has expressed the view
that the Federal Executive does not
possess the right or authority to reject
as a delegate a man like Harradine
elected properly under ALP rules to
represent his State.
Further fuel has been added to the
Harradine fire since the ALP Executive
meeting which ejected him. Spokesmen
at the ALP Victorian conference in
June insinuated that Harradine, a for-
mer member of the Democratic Labor
Party, was a DLP “plant.” The Left
Wing is also concerned with the reports
—which have considerable substance—
that prominent members of the ALP
are negotiating for some form of deal
with the DLP, a deal that can be made
only at the expense of the present con-
trollers of the Victorian ALP. If the
Harradine case gets involved with an
inquiry into these unofficial negotia-
tions, the fires of dissension will burn
really briskly.
There are other more fundamental
issues also likely to emerge. The Wes-
tern Australian ALP Executive, one of
whose representatives on the ALP
Federal Executive is the able, implac-
able Mr. F. E. (“Joe”) Chamberlain, a
superb committeeman, has put on the
ALP Federal Executive agenda an item
seeking a Labor testing in the High
Court of the legal status of the Vietnam
conflict and the actions of the Common-
wealth in connection with the conflict,
including the dispatch of Australian
troops.
This involves again the whole ques-
tion of the Australian-United States
alliance, already under a cloud because
of the recommendation of the Victorian
ALP conference, on the- initiative of
prominent ALP parliamentarian Dr.
J. F. Cairns for the re-examination of
ALP Federal policy on the alliance,
with the object of down-grading its
“crucial” nature.
This was a direct slap at Whitlam,
but since that setback he has gone very
quietly. He has said little and that
little of a non-controversial nature. At
this stage it is not known what line he
is going to follow if those antagonistic
to Harradine, negotiations with the
DLP, and the present form of the
United States alliance get tough as is
their present intention.
Chamberlain has said that he does
not think Whitlam is a fit and proper
person to be Labor’s Federal Leader.
The logical extension of this is that he
does not think Whitlam is a fit and
proper person to be an Australian Prime
Minister. If those who usually agree
with Chamberlain are influenced
psychologically by Chamberlain’s atti-
tude they will have no inhibitions about
getting tough. However, that toughness
may affect Gorton in his thinking about
a possible election this year.

AUSTRALIA
An end to subterfuge at the
annual shareout
AT THE PREMIERS’ CONFER-
ENCE last week Prime Minister Gor-
ton spoke of his Government as “the
Australian Government.” Previous Prime
Ministers have used the term “Com-
monwealth Government.” And in that
apparently small semantic switch lies
the clue to a completely new approach
by Mr. Gorton to the States.
No longer is Australian Government
a process by which seven Governments
one Federal or Commonwealth Gov-
ernment and six State Governments
share sovereignty and, acting as equals,
exercise their separate functions. Now
the Federal Government is paramount
and the State Governments are subord-
inate.
Thus in financial matters the old
division of tax fields subject to
dispute at the border only is being
abolished by Mr. Gorton. The Prime
Minister of the Australian Government
is claiming complete financial para-
mountcy.
The States have a legal and con-
stitutional right to levy income and
payroll taxes, Mr. Gorton acknowl-
edged. But, he said, “If they are levied,
we would necessarily have to reduce
the general revenue grants which are
available.” Specifically, Mr. Gorton
said that if duties on wages and salaries
like that of Victoria’s cent in $lO tax
are still in force in 1970 when the
present financial agreement comes up
for renewal, an equivalent amount
would be withdrawn from the Com-
monwealth grants to that State. In the
meantime, if Victoria raises the level
of the duty, the amount collected in
the rise will immediately be deducted.
But significantly, outside the field
of income and payroll tax, Mr. Gorton
also asserted his Government’s right
of veto over the States: “In other
fields of taxation we have just reached
the position where there will be discus-
sion before a State went into a par-
ticular field of taxation and before
actual rates of taxation in that field
were fixed.”
The Premiers, of course, protested
heartily. Mild Mr. Reece from Tas-
mania pointed out that the States
would have no idea where they would
go to get finance for themselves and
asked for a major study by the Com-
monwealth and the States to define
which areas they might go to.
Mr. Gorton in a keeping-the-
eptions-open style would merely lay
down the principle that the States
must keep completely out- of income
and payroll taxes and that other State
taxes would be opposed if “carried to
the point where they would signifi-
cantly affect Commonwealth revenue
collections or the carrying out of nat-
ional policies.” Mr. Gorton refused to
be drawn on where this point might
lie and refused to have the Common-
wealth drawn into any conference
which might attempt to define the
limit. He wants to be free to veto any
new tax proposal at any time.

eyed, said to Mr. Gorton that this new
Commonwealth policy meant that any
tax which he imposed without prior
Canberra approval was worth nothing.
He clicked his fingers. Mr. Gorton
smiled, but he said nothing in reply.
N.S.W. Premier Askin proudly declared
that his Government had the right to
levy any tax it saw fit and that he in-
tended to do what he thought necessary
for his electors. To which Mr. Gorton
politely but devastating! y replied: “You
have the constitutional right. But I
think it will be economically sensible
for you to. know the Commonwealth
attitude (to any new taxes).”
Mr. Gorton will undoubtedly point
out to anyone who attacks him as a
centralist who is undermining the
Federal system that he is simply re-
moving the public-relations cover, elim-
inating the subterfuge, and exposing a
situation of central government para-
mountcy which has really existed for
a long time.
The general intention of the Com-
monwealth Government is to rein in
the growth of Government spending
generally by really putting the financial
squeeze on the States.
In this it succeeded better than
usual. The total amount of money the
States will get from the Common-
wealth in 1968-69. will be around $2620
million, or $2OO million more than last
year. This is an 8 percent increase,
and given a rise in costs of about 5
percent it means the money will do
only about 3 percent more work. Last
year the States managed to get over
9 percent more in money and, with
costs up perhaps 4 percent, this did
5 percent more work.
Significantly, too, of the $2OO mil-
lion extra, almost a third comes not
as freely spendable money but as
“specific purpose grants,” money ear-
marked by the Commonwealth for
spending on roads, universities,
teachers’ colleges, dams, and railways.
Freely spendable money available to
the States rises only by 6.5 percent.
There can be no doubt about which
State did best out of the conference.
Western Australia really walked away
with the big prizes. On the surge of
its minerals boom, W.A. has rocketed
up from fifth State in prosperity to
third State in per capita income over
the past five years. Applying for money
to the Grants Commission, it has been
certain to get less and less in the
way of special assistance because of its
growing self-sufficiency. Therefore,
W.A. Premier Brand moved to have
the $l5 million which his State got in
Grants Commission assistance given as
a matter of Premiers’ Conference for-
mula grants before it dwindled away.
Although he did not manage to have
the amount built into the formula so
that it would rise year by year, he was
no doubt very happy indeed to have it
preserved and to be able to withdraw
from mendicant status.
Western Australia now gets $230 per
head of its population, less only than
Tasmanians with about $270. South
Australians and Queenslanders, who
are much less prosperous, get around
$160 each, while N.S.W. people and
Victorians get $130.
And the W.A. Government is about
to get rich on mineral royalties as well,
so the lesson of last week would appear
to be: go west. If you want lavish
Government, at least.
Universities
Pamphlet power
AFTER READING headlined accounts
of violent student action in other parts
of the world all this year, Australians
have been inclined to think, Thank
goodness our students aren’t like that.
Meaning, particularly, that they did not
come out on the streets and riot. But
against that comforting thought, set
these facts:
In Brisbane last week a mass meet-
ing of Queensland University students
decided to hold another civil rights
march through the city this week. In
September last year a similar march
led to violent clashes with Brisbane
police.
In Sydney, about 150 student acti-
vists holding their second sit-in at
Commonwealth Department of National
Services offices were again carried out
by Commonwealth police, one of whom
collapsed and died.
In Melbourne and Sydney, students
at Monash and the University of New
South Wales followed the lead of
French students by holding mass meet-
ings which demanded “participatory
democracy” in university management.
In Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane,
students sold or distributed thousands
of copies of a “How Not to Join the
Army” publication, encouraging draft
resistance and, if that failed, sabotage.
In Adelaide, Students for Democratic
Action joined other angry demon-
strators in the gallery and outside Parli-
ment House, and Perth students
arranged a quiet march and leaflet
handout for this week.
What stirred the Queensland Univer-
sity students to action was a Govern-
ment regulation banning the distribu-
tion of pamphlets on the street without
a permit. I'his, said the activist Civil
Liberties Co-ordinating Committee, was
one of the few ways left for minority
groups to express points of view. An
“enemy within” group meanwhile circu-
lated pamphlets on campus, condemning
the planned march as in no way repre-
senting the thinking of the university's
14,000 staff and students.
Finally the University Union stepped
in and called a mass meeting which
approved the march, overriding the
Union’s own plan to wait until the
Government had answered a submis-
sion that the permit regulation was a
denial of basic freedom. The students
were not in a waiting mood, and to
prove it some of them went immedi-
ately to the Brisbane shopping centre
to hand out pamphlets. Police con-
fiscated many, took names, and charged
a university lecturer with using abusive
language. It was a heated prelude to
this week’s march.
A strange sidelight of the week in
Brisbane was a Young Liberals plan
to print and distribute the Draft Re-
sistance and Sabotage pamphlet to
show the people what it contained—
an idea quickly abandoned in a rush
of commonsense. The pamphlet had
appeared on campus, but not as part
of the Civil Liberties thrust. Officially,
only one student had his name taken
for selling it. And if anyone was
looking for political advantage in that
quarter, State Labor Leader Houston
hurriedly disavowed any support what-
ever for it.
The publication was, however, re-
printed as a supplement in Mel-
bourne’s Monash University newspaper,
STUDENTS
Participatory democracy


“Lot’s Wife,” was sold by Melbourne
University’s Labor Club \ “mainly for
a laugh,” said club secretary Rowley),
and was on sale through a Sydney-
radical bookshop until Commonwealth
police raided it and seized copies after
Attorney-General Bowen had called for
a report on the publication.
Of all their activities, students
appeared to be exercising the most
pow-er in their demands for a say in
university government. At Monash
they finally dissolved their Students’
Representative Council and then sat
down to work out what they should,
have to replace it. Monash’s vice-
chancellor, Dr. Matheson, was reported
to have agreed to have two students
on the University Council and a
majority on the board of the Student
Union.
Under similar pressure at the Uni-
versity of New South Wales, officials
Professor Myers and Sir Phillip Baxter
opted for passive resistance, offering to
talk, expressipg doubts that under-
graduates would ever sit on the Uni-
versity’s administrative bodies. A meet-
ing of 2000 students and staff, called
by the Action for Love and Freedom
(ALF) group, asked for representation
in most decision-making. Said Pro-
fessor Myers, “the issue ... is very
complex.” University meetings would
be “influential,” he said, but really
“lacked legal authority to govern the
University.”
ALF’s unofficial leader, teaching fel-
low Ian Channell, advocated “fun-
powder to blow up the university” be-
cause “fun is easier to organise than
riots,” but Professor Douglas McCal-
lum, head of the School of Political
Science, turned a cold eye on such
“hippie cliches.” While admitting the
stimulating power of ALF, he con-
demned the notion that 2000 could
consider themselves equivalent to the
university’s community — more like
12,000 students and staff; but he
favored more staff, and even students,
on the Council. It seemed that seniors
were, perhaps, taking the whole thing
much more seriously than the under-
graduates.
At Melbourne University, for in-
stance, student demonstrators exerted
their power toward gaining a liquor
licence for their new Union Flouse.
They held a “drink-in” in the coffee
lounge, strictly non-violent and “most
enjoyable.” Melbourne alumni may,
at least, be justified in saying, “Well,
thank goodness our fellows are still
gentlemen.”
Parliament
The DLP Senate
“YOU KNOW, over the years the
Labor fellows have kept telling us we
were going to wither on the vine and
sometimes we weren’t too sure they
were wrong.” So spoke a leading
DLP man looking back over almost
The DLP Senators pose last week
14 years of uncertainty over the future
of the Party created by the Labor split
of 1954. “But we reckoned that if
we struggled on we had some chance
and none if we didn’t. So we gave it
a go.”
For years the DLP’s power lay al-
most solely in its negative function of
preventing the ALP getting a majority
in the House of Representatives and
forming a Government. For most of
its life it was impotent in Parliament,
even though it has always had some
representation in the Senate. Until
1965 it had a single Senator, and from
then on Senators Gair and McManus.
Even these two were able to create
trouble for the Government by skilful
organisation. In combination with dis-
sident Government Senators, they
helped harry the Government on a
number of occasions (such as the IPEC
case, postal charges, the VIP aircraft
affair, the Nexus referendum, petrol
prices, the National Service Bill). In
fact, from August, 1965, the DLP voted
with the Government in the Senate
only 52.9 percent of the time, but the
DLP never itself fully held the balance
of power.
Not until this week. On July 1 their
Senate team doubled from two to four,
following the November elections in
which both the Government and the
ALP yielded them a seat. This means
that for the first time both the Govern-
ment and the ALP are now entirely
dependent on the DLP. Even when
the Government is able to keep its
dissident members on side and to get
Independent Senator Turnbull to vote
with it, the DLP will be able to block
legislation.
How will the DLP use its power?
One of its first interests in the new
session of Parliament will be in relation
to the electoral law. The Government
will be introducing legislation to pro-
vide for a redistribution of House of
Representatives electorates. Since this
is certain to involve a consolidation
of inner suburban seats at present held
by the ALP, it will be opposed by the
Labor Party. But if the DLP is to
support the Government it will be
seeking something in return.
One bread-and-butter objective of
the DLP is amendment of the electoral
law to inject an element of propor-
tional representation into House of
Representatives elections. At present,
because its vote is relatively evenly
spread over electorates (unlike the
Country Party’s, which is concen-
trated) the DLP cannot manage to get
a single member elected to the House,
despite the fact that its electoral sup-
port is of the same numerical order as
that of the Country Party, which has
17 members. Both parties get between
8 and 10 percent of the total Australian
vote. Yet, because the distribution of
the vote is different, one is heavily
represented and the other is not repre-
sented at all.
At present, DLP leaders are studying
the West German electoral system. The
full application of this would give the
DLP about 12 members in the Lower
House, but it is more likely that they
will urge a modified form which would
provide a limited number of seats —say,
ten —which might be allocated propor-
tionally between Parties which did not
gain in single-constituency elections the
number of seats they deserve according
to their proportion of the total vote.
Without some concession of this sort
the DLP is dead against an early elec-
tion, because it would have to bear all
the heavy financial expenses of an elec-
tion campaign without much chance of
getting representation. Like the ALP,
the DLP is heavily in debt, but, unlike
the ALP, it finds campaign money very
hard to come by.
However, the full extent of the
DLP’s independence from the Govern-
ment will extend far beyond electoral
reform. Next session, with its new
strength, it will press the Government
hardest on those issues with which it is
most concerned. In this there will inevit-
ably be some subtlety. On what interests
it most —defence and foreign policy—
the DLP will get no support from the
ALP. But on these matters it can apply
indirect pressure. By combining with the
ALP on other issues, or threatening to
do so, it can display its strength to the
Government where it hurts, thereby
hoping to affect its defence and foreign
policies.


The . Deep South
Out of defeat,
the status quo
AFTER BEING defeated in the Milli-
cent by-election, South Australian
Premier Hall doubled the sitting time
of the Parliament that the rotten
borough absurdities of the South Aus-
tralian electoral system allow his Party
to dominate. He managed to do this
by having Parliament sit for two days
to pass the supplementary estimates
before adjourning until July 23. That
makes four sitting days to its credit
since the General Election in March.
In the evenly divided House last
week Mr. Don Dunstan’s Labor
Opposition attacked immediately.
Ignoring the supplementary estimates,
speaker after speaker tried to make
mincemeat of the Government’s de-
cision to press on with its plan for an
electoral redistribution giving unfair
advantage to country voters. This
filibustering forced the House to sit
throughout the night on both Tuesday
and Wednesday.
The Opposition members tried to
make nonsense of the Premier’s de-
cision to treat the Millicent result as
a personal victory for Labor’s Des
Corcoran rather than a vote for its own
scheme for electoral reform. It would
have been convenient for Mr. Hall to
find a way out of his earlier statement
that he was prepared to compromise
if Labor won Millicent, and, as it hap-
pened, he was able to snatch at least
the status quo out of defeat by the fact
that Mr. Corcoran has a large personal
following in Millicent and that many

Dunstan ... partisan loyalties also can
be fun
of the by-election issues were indeed
local ones. But there was no doubt
that both parties had made electoral
reform the central issue of policy and,
by most standards (including Mr.
Hall’s old ones), Labor received what
looked like a mandate to press for the
acceptance of its plan.
Mr. Dunstan has now set out to play
a hard game. He will allow pairs only
for urgent Government business and he
has announced that if a democratic re-
distribution scheme acceptable to both
Parties is passed by Parliament he will
press for a new election. Calling for
talks with the Government on redistri-
bution before any Bill is presented to
the House, he made the first moves in
what is likely to be a long, arduous, and
frustrating conflict of bitterly opposed
interests.
The Opposition has the ability in an
evenly divided House to alter legisla-
tion in committee, but a Bill could
again be amended in the Upper House
and then sent back, to be carried this
time by a simple majority. And, with
the Speaker’s casting vote, the Govern-
ment can get a majority. Thus the
matter of an honest agreement on pro-
cedure with the Government is clearly
vital to the Opposition.
But Mr. Hall rejected the idea of
talks, in favor of what he called public
discussion on the floor of the House.
In doing so he has indicated a final
intransigence which Labor, despairingly,
had half expected.
During the dinner recess on Tuesday
night some 1500 demonstrators gathered
by the steps of Parliament House. In
speaking to them Mr. Dunstan stressed
the necessity that political agitation by
his supporters should be lawful. The
demonstration had been organised by
the Trades and Labor Council, which
in early April had suggested direct strike
action to force electoral reform. At that
time Mr. Dunstan was still Premier and
he argued very strongly and publicly
against extreme industrial action. In his
advocacy on Tuesday of lawful,
moderate, yet intensive political be-
haviour he was no doubt fully aware
that, especially among Adelaide’s
students and unionists, he arouses re-
markably partisan loyalties and that a
wrong step even by his own organisers
could result in political expression
becoming disorderly. To add point to
this, Adelaide University students were
distributing last week a pamphlet
entitled “Mob Violence Can Be Fun.”
Aborigines
Child-trafficking
SOMETHING WAS expected to
happen when the Victoi'ian Department
for Aboriginal Affairs was established
in January this year. Now it has, with
the revelation last week by the Minister,
Mr. Meagher, of “the fashion of bar-
tering Aboriginal children like house-
hold pets,” often across State borders.
The Aboriginal Affairs Department
has found that the children were being
unofficially adopted by Victorian white
couples, who usually did not understand
the problems of adjustment of the
child, the child’s family, and of their
own family. In some cases children
were simply passed on when the diffi-
culties became too great. An Aboriginal
mother might later come to claim her
child, only to find that the boy or girl
may have been handed on several
times.

Meagher. .. the
fashion.
Worthy ... a
status symbol, like
owning a poodle.
As a result, the Department has
decided to launch a concerted cam-
paign. Its director, Mr. R. Worthy, told
.a meeting of the Victorian Social Ser-
vice Council that the idea of taking
away from Aboriginal women the
responsibility of caring for their own
children was so prevalent in Victoria
that 300 children, perhaps more, were
believed to be living with unofficial
foster-parents. “For some of these
people it is a matter of ‘do-gooding,’
but it is very misguided goodwill,” he
said. “For others it is a status symbol,
like owning a poodle.”
Mr. Meagher said there was a danger
that these children would in time think
of themselves as pets. “It has become
a fashion,” he said. “And fashions come
and go.” The child could find himself
suspended between two cultures, unable
to adapt himself to his family after
receiving a better education and after
living in a different environment, but
not fitting into the white community
either. “Some private organisations
have to some extent encouraged this
sort of thing without realising the
dangers involved,” said Mr. Meagher.
He asked every family who had
“adopted” an Aboriginal child to con-
tact his Department. By the next day
24 had done so, but they were families
which the Department considered to be
satisfactory.
Mr. Meagher said the solution to the
problem was not through legislating
specifically for Aboriginal children. “If
legislation is necessary to stop this
abhorrent traffic, it should be legislation
covering the adoption and fostering of
all children.”


It's great to be
a photographer
Find out how a career
in photography can bring
you money, prestige,
travel, excitement —almost
anything you want.
By Victor Keppler
Director of the Famous Photographers School
H ow often have you secretly envied the life of a professional
photographer? How would you like your work to present
exciting new challenges, to provide creative satisfaction and
rewards ? This is the life of a professional photographer, and
this is photography in Australia —now.
The demand for photographic work of
all kinds is constantly growing
This is a perfect time for you to get started. The demand for
skilled photographers in Australia is greater now than ever
before. More magazines buy and publish photographs—and
pay well for them. Large companies employ many staff photo-
graphers. Advertising photographers, particularly, earn big
money. Top photographers in this field often earn more than
$20,000 a year.
Even photographers working from their own homes, many
of them only part-time, are earning handsome incomes. Last
year alone, these photographers were paid well over one million
dollars.
Ten famous photographers offer a new
kind of training
To help others share in the growing opportunities in photo-
graphy, ten of America’s most distinguished photographers
have started a new kind of home study school.
One of them is Alfred Eisenstaedt. He was nearly 30 when
he turned to professional photography. Since then he has
become a major symbol of modern photo-journalism—has
travelled around the world many times, completing over 1,500
LIFE assignments—several of them devoted to Australia and
the South Pacific.
The others are equally famous: Irving Penn, Richard
Avedon, Bert Stern, Arthur d’Arazien, Philippe Halsman,
Ezra Stoller, Joseph Costa, Richard Beattie and Harry
Garfield.
These men spent three years putting their knowledge of
photography into a series of remarkable lessons. They con-
tributed or made over 2,000 “teaching photographs”, so that
each lesson would be like an actual studio or field demonstra-
tion. Then they developed a series of practical assignments—
which you carry out with your own camera, in your own home
or neighbourhood, on your own time schedule.
A single
photograph can
bring you income
year after year.
This one by
Arthur d'Arazien
has earned him
nearly $9,000 and
he still owns it.
Like private studio tutoring
Your instructors are all skilled professional photographers,
working under the close supervision of the famous Guiding
Faculty. They spend up to two hours on each assignment you
send to the School. They make special critiques (using pictures
and diagrams) which show you precisely how to improve
your photographs. And they write you long, personal letters of
advice and guidance. Their teaching is almost as personal as
private tutoring.
Dean of LIFE photographers and Famous Photographers School faculty member:
Alfred Eisenstaedt gets paid to take pictures of the world's most beautiful women
(like Sophia Loren above). He is regularly sent to places that most people would
love to visit—the Orient, the Caribbean, the capital cities of the world.
Students making money with their cameras
Students of the School who are still in training report early
success: Emil D. Prieto of Houston, Texas, writes, “Just six
weeks ago I opened my own studio. Already I’ve had 20
commercial assignments and about 30 portrait sittings.”
Robert Coyle of Dubuque, lowa, writes, “What a thrill to have
a picture I took of my son in my own backyard win the SI,OOO
Grand Prize in the Newspaper National Snapshot Awards!”
Lee Smith of Salem, Ind., says, “As the official photographer
for our city’s 150th anniversary celebration, I earned S9OO in
sales of reprints alone. Thanks for the help.”

OVERSEAS
Nixon is a wave
from the past
RICHARD MILHOUS NIXON is no
longer fighting for the Republican
nomination. Lie is conducting a mop-
ping-up operation.
Last week it took him into what was
once the heart of the enemy citadel,
Michigan Governor George Romney’s
State capital of Lansing. Symbolically,
as Richard Nixon trotted briskly down
the aircraft steps, there to greet him
was the only Republican ever to cam-
paign actively against him in a Primary.
It would be wrong to say that George
Romney (wiser and sadder now than
he was in New Hampshire last Feb-
ruary) looked cheerful or even con-
tented. He looked, in fact, like a rather
mournful hound-dog.
But he was a hound-dog who knew
his place in the Party kennel. Richard
Nixon was his “good friend,” he was
“a man of courage, tenacity, and vigor.”
There was “no other candidate who
could match his executive experience
and his legislative ability.” It somehow
all made the Republican convention in
Miami in five weeks’ time sound like
a formality—and that in effect is what
it now is.
Does someone confront Nixon with
an uncharitable remark made about him
by Governor Rockefeller? The response
is relaxed, the smile confident, the
expression winning—“ Well, you know
I’ve always said that it takes two to
make a quarrel.” In a flash, Nelson
Rockefeller, of the massive family for-
tune, the formidable political power
base, and the almost animal magnetism,
is banished into the corner as the bad
boy of the Party, who, when his temper
has cooled, will surely be wanting to
apologise.
It has, in fact, to be handed to
Richard Nixon. This year—in marked
contrast to 1964—he has played it cool
and he has played it right.
He has not so much answered a need
in the Republican Party as removed
the necessity for any such feeling to
exist. Everything has been taken care
of even the immaculately timed
announcement last December of a forth-
coming Nixon-Eisenhower matrimonial
alliance in the younger generation.
Where other candidates may have stood
for challenge, Nixon throughout has
represented reassurance and among
Republicans at least that will always
be an unequal conflict.
Yet, in himself Richard Nixon
even to those who flock to hear him
(less often now at political meetings
than at celebratory banquets)
remains identifiable mainly as a ghost
from the past. In a way, it is his own
fault: he has not so much stormed his
way to the nomination as moved up
steadily and stealthily toward it—until
there he is with the prize under his belt.
Even his audiences seem to find it
easier to salute his comeback (“The
greatest,” the wags say, “since Lazarus”)
than to go wild over his candidature.
Everywhere he goes, some local wel-
come group turns out and does its best
- but it is a hard job whipping up
excitement over this strange relic of
the Eisenhower era with his five-o’clock
shadow, his ski-jump nose, and his total
lack of a political extrovert’s gifts. Even
when he tries to overcome it, this dis-
ability shows through: responding to
hands thrust through an airport fence,
Nixon will sometimes feel the need to
say something but when it comes it
is a sad let-down. “Keep well” is as
often as not the injunction delivered.
Then, as if in recognition of the puzzled,
bemused expressions in front of him,
there follows the somewhat lame ex-
planation: “That is, we want everyone
fit and well for November.” It is, to
say the least, hardly the style of a
Kennedy, a Lindsay, or even a
Trudeau.
He remains a faintly unnatural public
figure in a communications age, if only
because he is so clearly inept at making
personal contact with groups or
individuals. Even on his own campaign
plane he talks to reporters as if they
comprise a huge audience at a public
meeting. The hands mow the air (on
and off the platform he practises
extravagant use of gesture), the choice
of language is theoretical rather than
conversational, the manner, at best, is
that of a slightly exasperated lawyer
trying to get a recalcitrant jury to see
a perfectly obvious point.
But if there can be no “a” for
aptitude, there should at least be an
“e” for effort. His is not a particularly
sparkling or even original mind, but it
grinds away doing what it thinks is
required of it. Whatever may be the
contradictory views about Nixon, few
would recognise in him the wave of
the future.
Yet, however improbably, that is just
the impression that he is now striving
to put over to the American elector-
ate. He is a highly professional plat-
form performer and it is perhaps a
striking tribute to his persuasive powers
that when he attempts to identify him-
self with what he claims is “the mood
for change” in America, no one seems
to detect any incongruity.
It is a remarkable achievement
for, even as he is extolling the national
breakthroughs to come in the 19705,
he is distilling the political attitudes of
the 19505. “I say to you, that when
respect for America has fallen so low
that a fourth-rate power can hi-jack
one of our vessels on the high seas, then
this nation needs new leadership” . . .
“When an American President sits
across the table from Communists, he
must always be able to speak from a
Richard Nixon ... “a faintly unnatural figure in a communications age”


position of strength and not of weak-
ness.”
If this is “the new mood” of 1968,
then history must truly have stood still.
But, of course, Richard Nixon knows
what he is doing. The “mod” verbal
clothes about being “the candidate of
change” are only a disguise: fundament-
ally Nixon believes that beneath all the
turmoil of the past few months one
voice has been muffled, the voice (as
he put it in a broadcast last week)
of “the great quiet majority, those who
are neither young nor poor, are proudly
in the mainstream of American life and
are determined to stay there.”
In 1968, as in 1960, these are Rich-
ard Nixon’s people and he is their
man. Perhaps the only difference is that
this year (with all its pent-up frustra-
tion and dissatisfaction, which is not
by any means confined to the Left)
there could well turn out to be enough
of them ready to make the final com-
mitment to nostalgia by electing him
President.
Japan
Pacifist kick
ELECTRONIC CLOCKS in Tokyo,
Nagoya, and Osaka daily remind the
Japanese how many days are left to
1970. Their purpose is to notify the
coming of Expo *7O, the Osaka suc-
cessor to Montreal and the first world
exposition ever held in Asia. In prac-
tice they also serve as a reminder that
1970 may produce a traumatic politi-
cal crisis the possible revision of
the Japan-U.S. mutual security treaty.
It says much for the emotions and
reactions this potential crisis already
arouses that some treaty opponents see
the organising and publicising of Expo
’7O by the Japanese Government as
indicative of the ruling Liberal Demo-
cratic Party’s belief in the efficacy of
extravaganza to absorb and distract the
nation’s energies and attention. It is
argued that the largely conservative
political business and bureaucratic
Japanese elite planned Expo as a diver-
sion. Student groups, not only the mili-
tant and fanatical Zengakuren, have
long regarded the treaty revision issue
for them its abrogation as the
“climax” for the student movement to
which all their recent outbursts are but
a prelude.
So maybe the diversionary tactic is
to prevent the students evoking wider
support, as they did when the treaty
was signed in 1960 amid grave dis-
orders; to therefore play upon the
strong Japanese desire to show their
best face for the large number of
foreign visitors Expo is expected to
attract and to not rock the boat in
their presence. Given ever-increasing
affluence to weaken radical tendencies
(the Expo will provide many jobs for
students who might otherwise riot),
might not the 1970 political pregnancy
be aborted?
Like much Japanese Leftism, such
interpretations as these probably add
too much Machiavellian guile to un-
reality. But they canot be dismissed
out of hand. A 1970 crisis would seem
distinctly possible if only because across
the political spectrum it is alternately
feared or anticipated.
Not that there has to be one. How-
ever, after the treaty has been in force
for ten years either party may give
notice to the other party of its in-
tention to terminate it, with one year’s
notice.
In other words 1971 could be an
even more mo'mentous watershed in
East-Asia than in South-East Asia.
Whatever reasons the Kishi and Eisen-
hower administrations had for making
the ten-year stipulation it would now
seem a mistake, for 1970 has come to
be regarded as a year of action or at
least a year when decisions have to
be made.
So there has been much talk either
of not renewing or of renegotiating,
while the treaty’s words, implying
clearly as they do that in 1970 nothing
need happen, have been ignored. Hence
the Liberal Democratic Party—favoring
automatic extension—has been pushed
on to the defensive.
The Japanese Socialist Party, whose
line has been expiry of the treaty,
expresses the belief that Japan’s
“Peace Constitution” has been more
responsible for Japan’s peace and pros-
perity than the treaty’s protective um-
brella. The Komeito (Clean Govern-
ment Party), which seeks “the abolition
of the security treaty by stages and the
complete neutralisation of Japan,” has
reaffirmed its support for “phasing out
the treaty,” arguing that the LDP policy
meant the perpetuation of “Japan’s
subservient role to the U.S.”
The small Democratic Socialist Party
took an interesting middle position
maintaining that “automatic extension
of the security treaty was in defiance
of Japanese public opinion.” The DSP
seeks the elimination of U.S. bases and
a new security treaty for bringing the
American presence back only in times
of ' emergency. The equally minor
Japanese Communist Party desires
abolition of all military alliances and
Japan’s security guaranteed instead by
a collective security system.
Nothing short of a political earth-
quake will propel these opposition
Parties into power, though LDP losses
might make a coalition with the
Komeito or DSP necessary. But mere
reiteration of the Party positions ex-
cludes the essential ingredient of wide-
spread emotional antipathy to the
treaty which, in turn, makes its con-
tinuance far from a foregone conclusion.
It is surprising to discover how many
Japanese intellectuals regard the 1960
furore as the first battle in a ten-year
war. While several American journalists
have referred to Japan “having been”
on a “pacifist kick,” the truth would
seem to be 'that many still are, and
passionately so, even allowing for the
divided faction-strewn peace movement.
There are the pro-Chinese sentiments,
the anti-American emotions, and . . .
the students.
The distinct possibility remains that
these ingredients might bake an ex-
plosive cake, especially as the Japanese
view of themselves and their nation’s
role might be the yeast. The conserva-
tives’ eminently pragmatic views—
amongst others that the security treaty
provides Japan with defence on the
cheap, that the Constitution should be
changed before the treaty—scarcely
make the LDP position of seeking
neither the ending nor the renegotiation
nor the formal renewal of the treaty
radiate popular appeal. Says Foreign
Minister Miki, “There is no need for
Japan to say anything to the U.S.”
about automatic extension, but it
might be necessary for the Government
“to express its intention in one way or
another to the people.” Indeed it will.
The Sato Government leaders must be
hoping for an end to the Vietnam War,
a revival of Sino-Soviet amity, or some
other surprise development in order to
make sure 1970 belongs to Expo alone.
Malaysia’s Ramani ... fiery questioning
Sabah
Back, in 1874...
From HARVEY STOCKWIN
THE SECOND WEEK of talks in
Bangkok over the Philippines’ claim to
Sabah was as unproductive and as dis-
cursive as the first. Once again the
main achievement was that a third
week of “discussions” promised to
follow upon the second.
The Filipinos continued to talk as
if their only interest was to reach agree-
ment on the settlement of the claim
by going to the World Court. The
Malaysians, seeing this viewpoint as
requiring their mere acquiescence, not
agreement, continued to insist that they


had to be persuaded on the substance
and legal backing for the claim before
they could agree to any form of settle-
ment. The continued absence of the
Filipino panel’s legal luminary, Ambas-
sador Quintero, helped prolong the un-
resolved dichotomy. The Malaysians
had requested two documents relating
to the claim, already made public in
Manila, but which the Filipino panel
had inexplicably failed to bring with
them. Quintero, who had returned to
Manila because of his brother’s death,
was slated to return with them, but by
Friday had failed to reappear. Just
about the most hopeful sign all week
was the reported order of President
Marcos that all documents required by
the Malaysians should be made avail-
able to them.
Otherwise there were plenty of storm
signals. The Filipino delegation
appeared singularly unprepared to dis-
cuss or substantiate their case and took
recourse to allegations and protests to
cover their all-too-apparent nakedness.
They had started off their, case by
merely presenting two volumes on the
claim, both of which have been long
available in Manila and elsewhere.
They are scarcely persuasive volumes,
even for laymen, still less so for legal
luminaries such as Malaysia’s ex-
Ambassador to the United Nations, R.
Ramani, to whose fiery questioning the
Filipinos could only respond by alleging
he was treating them as if he was a
prosecutor.
Two interesting aspects brought for-
ward by Ramani were his contention
that documents in the volumes were
different from the original texts and
that the Sultan of Sulu in 1874, having
received certain rights in what is now
Sabah from the Sultan of Brunei, had
no sovereignty to cede or lease to
British traders in the first place.
But points such as these have not
been carefully discussed, and neither
side appears able or willing to call for
the talks to be conducted in secret so
that they might get somewhere. To the
contrary, the Filipinos, having started
the week by misquoting the Malaysian
delegation leader, Tan Sri Ghazali
Shafie, ended it by using the talks to
protest over Ramani’s alleged use of the
word “pirate” to describe the former
activities of the Sultan of Sulu. The
Manila Press and some politicians took
the cue to create a hullabaloo, with
calls being made to break off the talks
and pursue the claim by other means
in the face of Malaysian intransigence
and rudeness. The Malaysian defence
was that Ramani merely quoted the
verdict of historians and others, but to
little avail.
Bearing in mind the earlier trouble
aroused for Mr. Alex Josey and The
Bulletin when that word pirate was used
in relation to the Malays it was an
interesting turnabout. But then even as
the earlier occasion had been a time
when Malaysian sensitivities were
aroused and under pressure, so the
significance of this “row” lay in the
aroused Filipino sensitivities even if
the pressures were largely of their own
making.
All in all the ultimate breakdown of
the talks remains fairly certain unless
one or both sides abandon their “high”
posture. This seems unlikely and the
amount of time spent in Bangkok dis-
cussing what should or should not be
included in the transcript of proceed-
ings only underlined the fact that what
happens after the talks is now more
significant than what happens during
them.
France
The battles of
tomorrow
THE GAULLIST tide has again
swept France. The tide began-to move
not on June 23, when the results of
the first round of the elections that
have now given the General a parlia-
mentary majority came in, but on May
31 when, on the morrow of the
General’s decision not to give way, M.
De Gaulle addressing workers on the eve of his greatest election victory
Seguy, the leader of the Communist
unions, turned the general strike into
a series of skirmishes. An unfinished
revolution is no way to win elections
and the Premier, M. Pompidou, did
not miss his chance. He grasped that,
whatever the Communists had done,
the Red peril would this time work
wonders. This is the main difference
between the elections this year and last
year: in 1967 a campaign of anti-
Communism paid poor dividends.
The result is being hailed as a
masterpiece of tactics. Once he had
survived the May crisis, M. Pompidou,
the Gaullist campaign manager, per-
ceived that his job was not to explain
the reasons for the crisis, nor to offer
a program for its cure, but to brandish
the red flag and frighten as many people
as possible to the polls. No effort was
spared. Once again, as in 1958, the
Gaullists have managed to drive to the
polling-stations those who normally
do not bother to vote. The strayed
Right-wing sheep were brought back
into the Gaullist fold through the lib-
eration of General Salan and his asso-
ciates. The Centre was blown off its
fence by the anti-Communist wind, with
some for'mer Centre Deputies being en-
dorsed as Gaullist candidates.
Yet it was not all fear. There was
also the absence of an alternative. Last
year, the Left, though still without a
program and badly divided, began to
attract many Frenchmen who were
plainly fed up with Gaullism. This
time, hopelessly torn and bewildered
by the revolutionary crisis, it looked
like nothing of the sort. It was
permanently on the defensive, trying
to prove that it had nothing to do with
riots and barricades.
The Centi'e, now bearing the name
of Progres et democratic Moderne, is
by definition in an uncomfortable posi-
tion when the country is deeply split.
In the present crisis it could hardly
preserve an illusion of impartiality. Its
one categorical imperative, this time,
was to prevent the election of a Com-
munist, not of a Gaullist. Bargains for
the second round confirmed the division
of this Centre Party into Left and
Right, with a bias to the latter.
One reason for the partial success
of the popular front last year was the
refusal of many middle-of-the-road
voters to vote for the Gaullists, and the
decision by some to vote for the Left.
This 'time they rallied to the Gaullist
candidates. This is symptomatic of a
mood which could undermine the
foundation of any popular front
alliance, the discipline of its supporters.
Last year the majority of Socialist
voters did not hesitate to transfer their
votes to a Communist candidate. This
year they did not.
Politicians with their noses to the
electoral grindstone may be tempted to
forget the May crisis, to treat it as an
accident, a bad dream. But they will not


easily be allowed to fall into tempta-
tion. The Left will be reminded of the
May crisis by internal dissensions over
strategy and by bitter post-mortems.
The Government has to live wdth the
consequences of the crisis. It must now
decide how to absorb the substantial
wage increases granted in a moment of
panic, while somehow preserving profit
margins. So far only such measures as
the introduction of export subsidies and
import quotas and a general supervision
of price increases have been announced.
The battles of tomorrow' will be fought
on the economic and social front.
South Vietnam
Student
peace power
THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE Gov-
ernment fears that the Viet Cong may
soon try to provoke it into a bloody
confrontation with increasingly restless
students in Saigon. “The Communists
want blood,” said one Cabinet Minister
last week. “They would like to see
the police shoot into a student demon-
stration.”
There seem to be at least three reasons
for the present revival of student politi-
cal activity. First, under the new
general mobilisation law, many of them
will no longer have immunity from
military service. Secondly, distaste for
the war has taken a more definite shape,
as it has among some of their elders,
under the influence of the Paris talks
and renewed hopes of a negotiated
settlement. And, finally, they have been
vaguely infected with some of the
excitement of the present world-wide
student movement.
So far they have dared do little more
than demand that the Government seek
a negotiated settlement to the war. They
are now cautiously preparing their
public position on the mobilisation law.
This could bring their first real test of
strength wdth the Government.
The temptation, to which some
American officials have apparently
already fallen, is to dismiss the leaders
as “Leftist agitators.” But it seems more
accurate to believe that there is general,
if often poorly articulated, discontent
with the present state of affairs.
This shows itself most strikingly in
students’ attitude toward the so-called
Alliance of National, Democratic and
Peace Forces, a front organisation of
middle-class intellectuals created by the
Viet Cong in April. This is a proscribed
organisation, and its leaders have been
obliged to go into hiding. But the
students seem to look on these men as
anti-American nationalists.
There is a good deal of naivety in
this. Some students, for example, insist
that Ho Chi Minh, too, is really a
nationalist who has adopted Com-
munism only for tactical reasons. But
there is also a genuine groping toward
what one of them called “a third way
that is neither Communist nor capi-
talist.” The tragedy is that between the
Americans on the one hand and the
Vietnamese Communists on the other,
a third way no longer exists in South
Vietnam.
If some of the students do now move
toward a confrontation with the
Government, impelled by their own
highly emotional thinking as well as
being deftly pushed from time to time
by Viet Cong agents, two possible fates
await them. Embittered by the experi-
ence, they may become virtually im-
mobilised by anti-American and anti-
Communist feelings that they cannot
possibly reconcile. (This has already
happened to some of the young men
who led the Hue students in the
Buddhist struggle movement of 1966
and who are now prime targets of sus-
picion for both Viet Cong and Govern-
ment agents.) Or they may go over to
the Viet Cong, particularly now that
the new Alliance offers the illusion of
a halfway house.
New Zealand,
The bust-up
SPECTACULAR DISPLAYS of pro-
test at the opening of Parliament last
Wednesday (which included the
roughing-up of the Australian High
Commissioner) were not the only pres-
sures working to change New Zealand
arbitration systems. Four thousand
workers made special trips from home
to the Parliament grounds on a day
when transport services were running
but when about 80 percent of the rest
of industry had halted in the biggest
industrial stoppage in Wellington’s his-
tory. While they chanted against the
decision of the Arbitration Court, which
gave them no general wage increase,
Federation of Labor President Skinner
was presenting submissions for a revised
court to the Prime Minister. Supported
by the FOL executive he sought new
weighting to the Court’s criteria.
Primary attention, he urged, should be
given to the cost of living, the main-
tenance of workers’ living standards at
a level which protects their relative posi-
tion in the community, and the preser-
vation of industrial harmony. Secondary
considerations were to be the economic
conditions affecting finance, trade, and
industry, any increase or decrease in the
volume and value of productivity in
primary and secondary industry, and
relative movements in the income of
different sectors in the community.
This week’s FOL conference could
either hang the unions’ case on these
amendments, take another case to the
Court immediately with or without the
Australian High Commissioner Sir
Edwin Hicks’ car surrounded by demon-
strators
changes, or ignore the Court in favor
of direct bargaining.
Local negotiations with employers
have begun, without the Employers’
Federation’s approval, and five percent
increases are being obtained both as a
result of these negotiations and the
desire of some employers to avoid in-
dustrial unrest and follow the lead given
last week by United Empire Box.
P. J. Luxford, the employers’ court
advocate, has called for the FOL to
take another case back to the Court,
but strong unions, encouraged by Wed-
nesday’s turnout and feeling their
strength, may consider direct bargain-
ing, with the chance of five percent
wage increases, preferable to a possible
percent to three percent increase
from a Court with which they have
become disillusioned.
Luxford’s reply followed initiatives
taken by Labor Leader Kirk, who seized
on the Government’s hesitancy in bring-
ing unions and employers together to
find an alternative to the Court’s de-
cision. Kirk offered the services of the
Joint Council of Labor, which is a body
comprised of FOL and Labor Party
Leaders. Kirk is trying to outdo the
Government as the would-be conciliator
in industrial relations.
Desire for a politically responsive
wage-fixing body capable of taking
broad economic criteria into account
is absent from union talk and so is
any publicised way of improving their
bargaining skills beyond use of the
industrial punch. The National Develop-
ments conference may show them the
way, but only in the absence of union
mistrust of the conference.
Personalities and politics are
obscuring union issues as irrelevant
recriminations fly about what happened
at Wednesday’s demonstration. Skinner
emerges as the general embarrassed by
the size of his army at the demon-
stration. Wednesday’s effort leaves
Skinner, who is unaccustomed to lead-
ing direct action, faced with this week’s
FOL conference and probably a call on
him to carry out his word.

ANARCHISM -What
By DONALD HORNE
MOST OF THE older people who go
out of their way to find excuses for
even the obvious absurdities of the
present European student-protest move-
ments are so anxious to scramble on
to the bandwagon that they throw away
everything they have previously be-
lieved without really knowing what
they are doing: they spring on to the
bandwagon naked, with all of their
inadequacies showing, whereas in their
own minds they believe they have
merely changed their clothes.
Their eagerness to stop being them-
selves is part of that panic that can
now seize so many people over the age
of 30 at the thought that something is
happening among the young that marks
a new revolution for mankind—one
every six months. Fortunately, some of
us who know that we were thinking
what the young now think at a time
before the young were born can calm
our nerves and recognise the essential
feature of the young, which is that
they have not got an original thought
among the lot of them: they live
entirely on old stuff, most of it mixed
up like garbage; but the best of them,
like tramps having fun on a rubbish
. tip, can give any old thing a new sense
of style. Just as they can wear old
fashions with new force, they can pick
up old ideas or new combinations of
old ideas and give them possible new
meaning. They are an echo of part of
our own past, throwing back at us
words some of us had known and then
discarded because they did not suit
our past circumstances but which might
possibly be relevant to our condition
now.
What is wrong with the attempts of
most of the over-30s to explain the
Western European student-protest move-
ments, or the actions of the most
articulate and rebellious leaders of them,
is that they have themselves not experi-
enced the essential beliefs that distin-
guish the present generation of Western
European student-protest leaders from
their predecessors. Whether they are 30
years old or 70 years old, both the
apologists and the critics among the
aged of present Western European
student turmoil have never experienced
that concern with anarchism and
syndicalism that distinguishes the West-
ern European protest leaders of now
from those of then.
Some of the present commentators
(both those who praise the students as
well as those who are against them)
have simply been dill-brained reaction-
aries who are now getting a kick out
of some mysterious novelty. Others
have been Stalinist or Stalinesque: if
they are old enough they were brought
up to believe that anarchists are simply
the first people you shoot after the
revolution; but they now suck up to
them. Many others grew up in the
period when it was fashionable to pro-
test about student apathy as if action
were a thing that is in itself necessarily
good: now they can see what action can
look like. And the rest are made up
mostly of the kind of people who boast
of themselves as “woolly minded
liberals,” as if a cosy dim-wittedness
were the only basis for political analysis
or political action; and as if violence
were not part of politics, and could not
sometimes do more good than harm.
It is because of this unfamiliarity
with anarchism and syndicalism that so
many confusions are made about the
extent to which student protests all
over the world are all about the same
things. Overall, it is only in Western
Europe (and in America, but in a
different way) that the romanticism of
anarchism and syndicalism is strong
among the leaders of student protest.
In other areas student protest is less
romantically inclined: in fact, some of
the protest in these other areas is anti-
romantic; it is the very opposite of
some present Western Europe fashions.
For this reason, before considering
the specifically anarchist and syndi-
calist aspects of Western European
student protest, it seems a good idea
to consider what, if anything, is com-
mon to student protest everywhere, and
then to consider what divides student
protest in some areas from others.
In looking for common elements one
can at once dismiss suggestions of a
world-wide Communist plot. Apart
from the fact that the most obvious
world-wide characteristics of Com-
munists now is their schismatic nature,
there is also the fact that student pro-
test in Czechoslovakia, for instance, or
Yugoslavia, can no more be described
as Communist-inspired than, for
example, the anti-Subandrio, anti-
Sukarno demonstrations of students in
Indonesia. To say this is not to deny
that in some countries Communists get
into the act. The best example is prob-
ably Japan. Here some of the rebellious
student movements are Communist-led,
in the old style, with no ambiguities,
although the conflict between the rival
Communist parties in Japan is reflected
in the conflict between rival student
movements. And in other countries
various kinds of Communists move in
and out of student movements, some-
times lending them expertise. But they
are playing a difficult game. The most
obvious present example is France,
where student extremism could
threaten the whole present character of
the French Communist Party, a fact
obvious enough in Moscow, where the
newspapers attack the French students,
in whom they see some of their oldest
enemies, the infantile leftists, exas-
peratingly restored to life.
The position becomes more confused
by the fact that many of the students
see themselves as belonging to one of
the sects of Marxism. The romantic
name of Che Guevara has made this
guerilla adventurist an international
pop-political star and the Trotskyists
are now having a good run in some of
the student movements. But one can
hardly imagine that the Trotskyists are
secretly supported by Moscow-
orientated Communist Parties. In
France and elsewhere the Maoists are
also strong, and while it is likely that
they are getting some support, and
perhaps a bit of money and practical
advice from the Chinese, it is also
likely that Maoism, Western-style, came
from its own promptings. In addition,
the demented anti-Americanism of
some of the Gaullists is reported to
have led some of their crummier secret
agencies to give secret subsidies to the
French Maoists. If this is so one hopes
that de Gaulle, having sown the wind,
now has fun in the whirlwind. (He
obviously will, since it is his particular
kind of a sense of fun that is one of
his main political promptings.)
What can be common to student pro-
test everywhere can be dismissed in a


few generalities. The central point is
that everywhere there are more
students, and they have become more
important. That there are more of them
produces strains in both students and
academic staff; that they are more
important means that they have a
greater sense of power than they have
ever enjoyed before. All societies now
recognise, one way or the other, that
there is some relation between educa-
tion and material progress. Education
is the mystery that produces future
prosperity: this gives students a sense
of significance they have not had before.
When the older societies created cities,
they created the “city mobs,” who
became a factor in power struggles: by
creating new roles for their universities
the new societies have created student
mobs, who can now be a factor in power
struggles. This is not new. In the
countries of Asia, where universities
assumed a sense of new and different
importance earlier than they did in
the West, students were available a
generation or more ago to create dis-
order on behalf of the new nationalists.
(For that matter, students were available
to the new German nationalists in the
19th century.) In India, and elsewhere,
this process began at the beginning of
the century. With nationalism satisfied,
students in Asian countries are now
available to challenge presidents. Presi-
dent Syngman Rhee, President Diem,
and President Sukarno became aware
of the role of students in politics before
President Johnson and President de
Gaulle.
It is the political role of the student
mobs that provides the element
common to student protest everywhere.
There is not much point in just going
on wondering about it. We must now
simply get used to the idea that student
protest is going to be a part of politics,
in the way that city mobs have been a
part of politics. Other than this, what
is it that all university protests have in
common? My answer would be
nothing. As “The Economist” said
recently: “There is no worldwide student
movement and no worldwide student
conspiracy. The one is a creation of
unoriginal liberal minds; the other of
tired political ones. Considered
globally, “student power” is a neutral
substance, a carrying agent, that has
the potential to be anything left,
right, or centre. You can paint it any
color you like, according to particular
circumstance. As such, prompted by
those students who seek heroic excite-
ment or the pleasure of bustle and
influenced by their elders, it is the role
of student movements to take up issues
that have already been given wide (if
sometimes clandestine) currency and
add drama to them. Students are enter-
tainers, giving human interest to other
men’s causes. As one would expect
from a modern entertainment industry,
one of their important roles is that of
an echo chamber.
To realise this can give instant moral
relief. One does not have to answer the
question: What do you think of the
students? One has to ask the question:
Which students? One can support those
students who support what one believes
in and condemn those students who
support what one doesn’t believe in.
When a student procession comes down
the street, don’t cheer or boo just
because they are students. Wait until
you can see the whites of their placards.
Then you know whose side you are on.
If you watched intelligently the BBC
show a couple of weeks ago in which a
number of student protesters said their
pieces, you could see some of the
important dividing lines in present
fashions in national student movements.
A different sense of style divided the
Czech, Yugoslav, and Spanish students
from the French and German students.
It came out even in their clothing, as if
things were serious enough in Czecho-
slovakia, Yugoslavia, and Spain not to
need fancy dress for added interest.
Even though the Spanish student was
some kind of a syndicalist, you could
see the difference between him and
the chatterboxes from France, or the
nit from Pakistan who led the British
team. In Spain, syndicalism has a
meaning that it lacks elsewhere.
The members of various breakaway
Marxist sects profess to find in the
protest movements in the Communist
countries some kind of an echo of
that criticism of the hollowness of
affluence and democracy that is found
in the protests of Western Europe.
It’s hard to see. There is no unity of
protest in the Communist countries,
but what is most apparent are trends
that can be interpreted as a desire for
affluence and democracy, sometimes
with—of all things—some religious
undertones. There seems to be a con-
cern to turn the Communist States into
prosperous social - democratic com-
munities (which was where the main
part of the non-revolutionary Marxist
movements came in). If one turns
even further away from Western
Europe, one finds, in the poorer nations,
that students, ,as in Indonesia for
example, protest not only in favor of
the liberal-democratic institutions that
students laugh at in the Sorbonne, but
that they make the material welfare of
ordinary people one of their most
important causes. They can be nation-
alists in a way Western Europe would
describe as old hat, and they can
demonstrate against those heroic and
disorderly views of society that provide
much of the emotional appeal in Wes-
tern European student oratory. (Who
would want to be an anarchist after
putting up with Sukarno?)
It is with the American students that
the Western European students at first
seem to be most easily compared, but
this comparison can be illusory. We
do not yet fully understand how different
America is from the rest of the world
(and how it may be that Japan will be
the first country that can be sensibly
compared with America). America,
still a “new society,” still shows a dis-
tinctive capacity for change that still
makes it unique in its powers of regen-
eration.
In a recent article in the American
“Nation,” Michel Crozier, who teaches
sociology at the University of Paris,
minimised the significance of the
present crisis and violence in America
(because America is historically a land
of crisis and violence and because, like
France, it can wipe out the effects of the
conflicts that tear it apart). He found
its distinctiveness to lie in America’s
new aggressive confidence in human
reason and in its capacity to solve all
problems by the use of reason. “Never
before has the world seen such an
extraordinary capacity to mobilise
resources and put them to work . . .
Modern America has discovered the
extraordinary complexity of the
problem, technological, psychological,
and ultimately organisational, and has
created instruments to develop ration-
ality of action at its focal points. The


practical successes of the science of
decision-making are by now conclusively
proven . . . This belief in the omnipo-
tence of reason is in sharp contrast to
the existential anguish of the young
hippies and the Negro revolt. But the
two movements are the opposite faces
of America’s transformation, of its
passage, as it were, to a new form of
society. We Europeans have a poor
understanding of this split (when we
notice it) because we are still blinded
by the Marxist or para-Marxist schem-
atic analysis . . . Never have men of
action in America been less conformist.
It is Europe that now seems over-
whelmed by the burdens of old loyalties
and organisational mistrust. It is
Europe that most suffers from the
timidity of ‘Organisation Men.’ Com-
pared with these, America seems to be
populated by irreverent and innovating
Young Turks.”
Crozier then makes his critical point:
“The image of America tomorrow,
the America which attracts the hopes
of new generations, is not that of
tenacious and sententious administra-
tion emerging from labyrinths of tests
but of the young ultra-brilliant scientist
capable of categorically opposing his
superior and, if the latter refuses to
give way, finding the next day the
capital necessary to carry out his idea
by founding a rival company. It is still
a myth, of course, but a myth beginning
to come true. The real cost of rational
progress, therefore, is not at all aliena-
tion through bureaucratic regimenta-
tion, the loss of individuality. It would
seem to be quite the contrary. The cost
has to be sought in the growth of
individuality itself, in the ever-increas-
ing burden that comes from freedom of
choice.”
This point is critical because it
underlines the irony of the fact that
the real cost of rational progress is the
growing anguish that comes from the
contemplation of freedom. Says
Crozier: “The cross carried by the
American male of the nouvelle vague
is not his submission to the large organ-
isations (the latter having become in-
creasingly flexible and tolerant), it is
his submission to rationalism itself, the
manipulation of himself by himself to
which he finds himself condemned if
he wants to succeed.”
It is this new challenge that provides
the distinctive role in the present pro-
found moral turmoil in America and it
is in the American universities that its
most profound effects are first to be
expected, since they are the powerhouses
of “the new, hyper-rationalist world.”
It is from this that the protests of the
American young acquire their element
of pure revolt. “More than others in
American society, students are fasci-
nated by the system through which they
expect to benefit, and which provides
their best weapon against their elders,
still caught-in a less rational past. At the
same time it frightens them, for it
already weighs heavily on them and
they sense that they will pay dearly for
the inheritance. It is they who must
be the rational men in the de-mystified
world of tomorrow.”
From this come the revolts of drug-
taking, the new mysticisms, the great
games of strikes and sitdowns, the
retreat into send-ups, happenings, put-
ons. The agony of staring into an
excessively clear world of rational
decision-making is relieved by abandon.
The desire for freedom is overcome by
the fear of responsibility, the rejection
of all decision-making.
Those American revolts are imitated
in other countries. But they are imitated
by young people who do not know
what they are imitating; who affect an
anguish they do not understand and
who seek releases that for them become
merely young people’s fashions. It is
in America alone that students provide
the world with a genuinely new thing.
There is no novelty in the American
students’ protests about Vietnam,
poverty, Negroes, power structures, or
affluence: but in their unique acquain-
tance with the future face of human
rationalism they provide reactions to a
PARIS, 1968
phenomenon the rest of the world does
not yet know. It is for this reason that
it is quite correct to detect an under-
lying silliness in Western European
student protests. In Western Europe
students are romantically playing an old
game: in America they are reacting,
with great confusion, to new situations.
In this muddle, both in the origin-
ality of America and in the imitation
of Western Europe, the almost forgotten
impulses of anarchism or syndicalism
seem at first to have relevance, especi-
ally in that sense of a mythical future
that they can provide.
One of the theses nailed to a door
at the Sorbonne said: “The revolution
which is beginning will call into
question not only capitalist society but
industrial society. The consumer’s
society must perish of a violent death.
The society of alienation must disap-
pear from history. We are inventing a
new and original world. Imagination
has seized power.” When asked to say
specifically what changes they want in
society, the fashionable student answer
in Paris was: “We don’t know.”
Like almost all other secular ideals
of the West, anarchism represents a
secularisation of an aspect of Chris-
tianity—its apocalyptic, revolutionary
aspect. Suddenly there will be a great
day when everything will be all right.
This last judgment of mankind will be
effected by an event known not as the
Resurrection but as the Revolution. It
will be effected by the salvation of
human sacrifice, but, when it is over,
cleansed of sin, men will be brothers,
living in a heaven on earth.
It is essential, in the purest form of
this apocalyptic doctrine, that practical
considerations of how and when and
what should be excluded as corrupt
heresy. That is why, in their heyday,
anarchists insisted on not being practi-
cal. Continuing heroism and excitement
were good, but the heroism was best
when it was senseless: their enemies
were those Marxists who tried to get
something done. This is why Che
Guevara, Castro, and Trotsky (and, in
his cultural revolutionary form, Mao
Tse Tung) become heroes. Because they
have all been flops who can’t get things
done, their blunderings and their crav-
ing for unrest become symbols of pure-
ness of heart. By failing, they do not
risk the disappointments of success.
They do not destroy the anarchist
dream that out of holy turmoil finally
emerges the new man, washed clean in
the blood of his martyrs, so that his
mind is free, creative, spontaneous, and
he has a good time in bed, thanks to
the diagrams of Wilhelm Reich.
Compared to this vision of final
goodness, everything that now exists is
a sham. This is where, as a destructive
analyst of the meaning of words, Her-
bert Marcuse comes in. He debunks the
institutions of the “free world,” seeing
repressiveness in their very liberties

thing, since there are always difficulties
in deciding what the hell you are talk-
ing about if you examine your words
intently enough, what he says can
effectively echo that sense of hollow-
ness that is so often a mark of youth,
as it sheds the beliefs of childhood,
insecure and lonely, not knowing how
to behave. This destructiveness, so
fitting the mood of youth, is itself only
part of that general explosiveness of
modern thought that, in physics, in
psychology, in sociology, in art, almost
wherever it turns, bears the message
that things are not what they seem.
Presumably, I need not lecture
readers of The Bulletin on the fact that
in a world of illusions the dreams of
anarchism can be one of the greatest
humbugs of all, nor on the fact that
because one can engage in destructive
verbal analysis (one of the real appeals
of Marxism to intellectuals in its hey-
day"! does not mean that the results of
one’s actions will secure the effects one
desires. The students strike: the result
is a political victory for de Gaulle. Nor
should it be necessary to enlarge on the
element of fun that can be one of the
real promptings of student action—the
pleasurable violence of smashing things
up, the primeval thrills of being one of
the mob, the delights of physical
danger, the excitements of the snaps
and snarls of political intrigue; in short,
the release a man can get from acting
like an ape.
I should like merely to take up two
particular. and less obvious questions:
The first is that, in the name of
individualism, anarchism can now be a
form of anti-individualism; and the
second is that whereas anarchists could
once believe that they were the van-
guard of “the people” it would now
seem more likely that their principal
revolt is against the people.
Number One. If the kind of view
of the future of America given by
Michel Crozier is correct, when a
student says that the society of aliena-
tion must disappear from history, that
he is inventing a new and original
world, and that imagination has seized
power, we can conclude that what the
student means “objectively” is the
opposite of what he says. The student,
by falling back on 19th-century apoca-
lyptic romanticism, is a reactionary,
deprived of imagination, protesting
against the dawn of a new and original
world in which imagination can seize
power and in which alienation might
diminish. He is, in effect, protesting
against that growth of individuality,
that growth of freedom of choice, that
is involved in the hyper-rationalist
world of the future, now flickering into
at least a believable myth in America.
Whether he knows it or not, he is
rebelling against “the de-mystified
world of tomorrow”; he is retreating
from belief in the human intellect, the
very mark of human distinction and
individualism.

was also the cause of the workers and
peasants of those societies of “the West”
that, although moving cataclysmically
through the industrial and agrarian
revolutions, were still looking back at
old wisdoms about the eternal necessity
of poverty and deprivation, wisdoms
attested at first by divine law, and
then by the iron laws of the newly
invented science of economics. Now we
know that those old wisdoms are not
true. In the world’s affluent or afflu-
escent societies, we now see being
enacted the beginning of mankind’s
great dream of a world in which want
would disappear and some choice
(“freedom”) would be a part of the
human condition. However, some of
the immediate inadequacies of this
world in its transitional stages have
made intellectuals irritated and they
teach the young the new forms of their
irritation. Change has affronted that
sense of old wisdom that is usually all
that an intellectual has in his head.
He finds himself in a new world with-
out a new intellectual map. This makes
him sad. He then projects this sadness
on to “the people” (who are not
saddened by the fact that they live
longer and that they are beginning to
go through an infancy of choice). So
that at a time when, in the more for-
tunate countries of the world, people
have never been happier, intellectuals
speak as if the people have never been
more sad. When intellectuals revolt
against the rationalism that is now
producing prosperity for “the people,”
they revolt against the future possi-
bility of freedom for the people. When
they are too impatient about the
present inadequacies in the uses of that
prosperity, they risk being not
reformers, but reactionaries. It was
reactionary to kill the goose that laid
the golden egg.
While anarchism reflected the
individualism of Christianity, syn-
dicalism reflected its sense of hu’man
brotherhood. Details of the kind of
society that the Revolution would pro-
duce remained necessarily mysterious
to the anarchists, but the syndicalists
liked to believe that they knew in some
detail what should happen. In the
syndicalist society there was to be none
of the apparatus of the State: in a
State-less society things would be run
by “the producers.” Workers would
seize the means of production and
distribution and run them in self-con-
tained and self-governing fraternities,
linked together in loose federations.
How old-fashioned to anyone except
a reactionary intellectual this now
seems. In the primitive beginning of
the industrial revolution manual
workers might have been able to run
the mills, more or less, subject to the
apparently inevitable tendency for
organisations to become oligarchic. The
coal and iron industrial revolution of
Britain was made up very largely by
men who were good with their hands.
But in the technological and research-
based industries of the present and the
future we look to men who are good
with their brains. If we are to dream
of the future, it is, in a sense, of a
society in which there are fraternities
of producers, but they are groups of
highly educated and hyper-clever men,
to whom work becomes a game: the
rest of the community is gradually re-
lieved of the necessity to work hard.
One can now imagine a society which
does not see any necessary connection
between work and material reward.
This was, in fact, one of the old dreams
of the socialists. The only way it can
be made true is to give modern decision-
making processes their full run. To
revolt from them is to revolt from
freedom.
To the old syndicalists the workers
were the hope of the side: they were
supposed to be the creative force
needed to regenerate society. To the
student syndicalists of today the
workers are usually a shapeless lump,
a lot of stodge that can have meaning
only if it is reshaped by students. Just
as Marie Antoinette and her court
dressed up as peasants, for their amuse-
ment, the students get kicks by talking
of the workers. But, despite exceptions,
the real enemies of student revolt, if
it takes anarchist or syndicalist forms,
would be the workers, whose present
dissatisfactions with society are that it
doesn’t yet lay enough golden eggs.
Increasingly the new forms of hyper-
rationalism make life easier for the
workers, not harder, both at work and
in material benefits. Those whftm
hyper-rational procedures can most
offend are the bosses (who, in a
modern society, are the students when
they graduate and get jobs). It is on
how the students, when they beco’me
bosses, react to new intellectual tech-
niques that our future rests.
To have said all of this is not to
deny that it can do us good to have
our habits thumped about by students—
not least because they are usually so
unoriginal, so 'that if we have any sensi-
tivity they can provide us with the
gentle shock of reminder rather than
of revelation. The echoing quality of
students may have its greatest use when
they remind us of things some of us-
have already been discussing now for
some years, if perhaps in a too desul-
tory way the end of the Protestant
Ethic, for example, or the end of the
concern with manufacturing as an over-
riding, central economic activity.
But one cannot resist the specula-
tion that the real shocks we are going
to suffer in the next couple of decades
will come not from the romantic rebels
who look back but from the quieter
students who are looking forward to
finding their fulfilment in the new
hyper-rationalist world. The next
revolution may come not from humani-
ties students re-enacting old roles in the
streets as if history were nothing but
crowd scenes from an old play; it may
come instead from the technocrats of
the new generation, if they 'become
intent on increasing the potential of
the human mind. It is against the
potential of their own generation that
the rebellious students rebel: the rest
of us are merely spectators.


Even death comes duty free
Norfolk Island’s economy relies on the tourists Qantas flies in. The
pines framing the old penal settlement (right) are the island’s pride
By BATMAN
NORFOLK ISLAND, 3 p.m., circa
June. Some maps say we are 950
miles frotn Sydney, others insist we are
1035 miles away. Norfolk Island is like
that it is not sure where it is.
Norfolk is about five miles long,
about three miles wide, with about 1000
people and about 600 motor vehicles.
It has no traffic lights and only one stop
sign. Actually, the charm of Norfolk
Island is in the things it does not
possess.
It has no wharf, no street lighting,
no pedestrian ways, no reticulated
water system, no sewerage, no taxes, no
rates, no burial duties you can pass
away for free—no TV, and no radio.
Well, to be honest, there is radio
from 9.30 a.'m. to 10 a.m. five days
weekly, with a bonus on Wednesdays
of a special request session until noon.
As for TV, a matron tourist com-
plained at breakfast: “I have been all
over the world and this is the first
place we have struck without tele-
vision.” We nodded our heads in
sympathy, thinking of all those episodes
of “Coronation Street” and “Peyton
Place” lost for ever.
No newspapers? Well, there is one,
the “Norfolk Islander,” a roneoed sheet
produced weekly by Tom Lloyd,
circulation 700, and it is a beauty, a
very lively journal, indeed.
Last week a correspondent com-
plained that tourists came to Norfolk
only for “the loot,” that they were
not interested in the beauty of the
v place. One suspects this could be true.
Last year there were 8422 loot-hunters,
but that figure will not be equalled this
year. There was a drop of 500 up until
the end of May, caused mainly by New
Zealand’s financial agonies.
Loot Alley is a collection of duty-free
shops at Burnt Pine. Once upon a time
Australia was on the ru'm currency. A
man could be excused for thinking
Norfolk was on the transistor currency.
They are everywhere, even in display
cases in hotel foyers—Sonvs, Nationals,
Sharps, Bulovas. It is not generally
realised how the Australian mainland is
surrounded by multi-millions of tran-
sistors, with the Customs Department
barely holding back the tide. Local
traders claim tha-t Norfolk transistor
prices are 10 to 15 percent above Hong
Kong, cameras just a trifle above, but
they say watches are 10 percent cheaper
they come in by air freight.
Perhaps the most voracious loot-
hunters are the New Zealanders. After
the transistors they pounce on tape-
recorders, walkie-talkies, Pringle twin
sets, collapsible suitcases, and things
you cannot live without, like com-
bination torch - vacuum - boot-polishers
and electric toothbrushes.
But what do you do on Norfolk?
That is a good question. It would be
an error to state that there is any wild
nightlife; even the movies at Rawson
Hall are still advertised as “talkies.”
The thing to do is to hire a Honda
motor-scooter, which costs, petrol and
all, a little over $2 a day. Your cor-
respondent may not survive until the
end of the week, but driving a Honda
here is the thrill of a lifetime, and,
after all, burial is free.
Norfolk is a marvellous place to
explore. Firs,t there are the superb
Norfolk pines, 'which dominate every
outlook. Most of them are more than
400 years old; they stand like enor-
mous totems, looking somewhat out of
place on a Pacific island. One tourist
asked the tour guide, lan Kenny,
whether they were brought in from
Australia, Canada, or Europe. Mr.
Kenny, terribly shocked, replied that
Norfolk Island pines were all present
and correct when Captain Cook
arrived and he had no prior knowledge
to that. Some were chopped down yes-
terday at the South Pacific Hotel and
they measured 140 ft. The proprietor
said guests found it awe-inspiring when
pine cones dropped on the roof from
140 ft.
The prime tour for one’s Honda is
the convict settlement at Kingston,
which is remarkably well preserved,
and it takes little imagination to pic-
ture the scene as it must have been
in the 1830 s most of the buildings
are still there.
The guided tour always goes past.
“Bloody Bridge,” where allegedly 14
convicts murdered their warder and
then bricked him into the bridge they
were building. Next day blood oozed
out through the stones; the 14 convicts
were strung up at Gallows Gate and
then buried in a mass grave. Well,
you get shown the Bridge, the cracks
where the blood must have oozed,
Gallows Gate where they swung, and
the very mound under which the 14
bodies are supposed to be. Historians,
regrettably, are inclined to question the
tale; nevertheless it is first-class
macabry and it even out-macabres
looking for the spot where they
chopped off Anne Boleyn’s head at the
Tower of London.
There is a graveyard down by the
sea and, as a lover of graveyards, could
one point out this has few equals.
There are tombstones, clearly marked,
going back *to 1792, and, oddly enough,
even convicts get very nice stones, ex-
plaining why they were executed for
this and that “murderous revolt.”
Many of them favor the old English
style of versifying, such as Martin
Burns, who departed this life September
10, 1841, aged 40 years.
Ye Christian Brethren as ye pass by
Pray on this tomb cast an eye.
As I am now so you must be
Prepare yourselves to follow me.
Yet if you are not graveyard-minded
other explorations are available. There
is one mountain over 1000 ft. and the
island is almost entirely surrounded by
spectacular cliffs 300 ft. high. There
are only two or three small beaches.
That is the reason why there is no
port. A small freighter arrives, maybe
every 16 days, and then follows a
remarkable scene. Last week we had


a visit from the Jacques Del Mar. She
stood off a quarter of a mile from the
cliffs of Cascade Bay and the islanders
unloaded her using 30ft. open long-
boats as lighters. These they towed
back and forth by launch. It was
almost like watching a pirate movie of
a smuggling scene on the Cornish
coast. The freight wasn’t all that dif-
ferent such things as boxes of
Kelloggs Corn Flakes, Bacardi Rum,
and gallon jars of Penfolds Dry Red.
The islanders are very friendly, 'they
always wave. When driving a car
there is a special technique. One
acknowledges the existence of another
human by raising two fingers from the
steering-wheel. Yet there are certain
class distinctions. The aristocracy are
those who can trace their lineage back
to Pitcairn Island and the Bounty, the
Christians, the Adams, the Nobbs, or
(the Quintals. Then there are those
who work for the administration, there
are the old settlers, the newcomers
after a quick buck, the retired gentle-
men, and then the further division
of the Australians and the New
Zealanders.
The island is split between those who
want to keep it as it is and those who
see its future as a sort of Surfers Para-
dise of the Pacific. The feeling between
the two is bitter. One gentleman in a
letter to the “Norfolk Islander” this
week says: “May I make one suggestion
to you people who don’t seem to like
Norfolk as Norfolk is at present. Take
one good look at the place and then buy
a single air ticket that will take you
out, never to return.”
Of course, without the tourist Nor-
folk would starve, but one sympathises
with the anti-progress party. The loot-
alley brigade is destroying the charm of
old Norfolk, and four* out of five build-
ings being erected are either sub-
standard or hideous. There is a passion
for the A-frame, and Norfolk Island
must be the world’s only historic penal
settlement that looks like a skiing re-
sort.
The economy rests on the benevo-
lence of Qantas, which operates DC4
Skymasters on a flight twice a
week out of Sydney. The same air-
craft also fly to New Zealand on charter
to Air New Zealand. The aircraft have
to be Skymasters; nothing else has the
range, the payload, four engines over
water, and can land on the Norfolk un-
sealed strip. They are a lovely old
aeroplane and your correspondent is
sufficiently old-fashioned that he be-
lieves in the sight of propellers going
around. But others would like to see
something more dashing, for the air-
freight - non - port - smuggling - type
economy makes life difficult and the
ordinary necessities which have to be
brought in expensive. Petrol for that
Honda is 60 cents a gallon.
But, dear reader, now I must close.
Trading hours on Norfolk are 9.30 to
noon and two to four. I must hurry
out to keep up my loot quota. That
is, I must amble out. One never over-
does things on Norfolk.
Heart transplants:
“Time to call halt”
By DR. ABRAHAM MARCUS
IF A RELATIVE or friend of mine
who had been offered a heart transplant
asked my advice, my immediate im-
pulse would be to say, “Don’t have it.”
But before doing so I would want to
put one question to the surgeons: “Can
you prevent his body from rejecting
the new heart?” The answer ought to
be, I believe, that they do not under-
stand enough about the rejection phen-
omenon to control it effectively. If
their answer were to be no more com-
forting, and I don’t think it could be,
I would advise against the operation.
It is my opinion that in our present
state of knowledge this operation
should not be performed and it. should
never have been attempted. That is the
central ethical problem, the discussions
about defining death and controlling
the circumstances under which organs
are obtained, important as they are,
remain on the periphery until we are
able to decide the main issue.
While the British Minister of Health,
quite rightly, called a conference to
debate the conventional ethics of death
and non-death—the patient maintained
in a semblance of life by artificial
means he has neglected, as far as
we know, to call together his specialist
advisers to decide whether or not the
time has come to do these operations.
The lesser problems have deflected
interest from the main issue, partly
because they fall within the traditional
field of the legal profession and the
clergy. Therefore, by discussing them
in the wider forum, the medical pro-
fession, to everyone’s satisfaction, would
appear to be submitting to the higher
authority of society. This is not the
case. As things are, any surgeon who
believes he possesses the necessary
expertise and the technical facilities
basically a bypass apparatus to take
the circulation outside the body is
free to carry out this operation if he
can secure the co-operation of his
colleagues.
There are many doctors who would
maintain that to decree otherwise would
be clinical interference and that while
some abuses might occur it is in the best
interest of the patient, on the whole,
that the doctor should be free to do as
he thinks best. Broadly speaking, this
proposition may be acceptable enough
provided one condition is satisfied:
Namely, that proper guidance is avail-
able through the profession itself on
decisions as highly complex technically,
ethically, and socially as is this one
on heart transplantation. To my know-
ledge, no organ of the profession
neither the Royal College of Surgeons
nor the British Medical Association,
nor any other—has tried to weigh this
'matter in all its scientific aspects. This
is a serious failure.
The rejection phenomenon is dealt
with by certain special drugs, but
mainly by steroid drugs those allied
to cortisone. When signs of rejection
are observed, the tendency is gradually
to increase the dose of steroids until it
reaches a level far outstripping any
other situation in medicine in which
they are used. Washkansky, Professor
Barnard’s first case, was getting some-
thing over 500 mg. daily, it is under-
stood, which could have disastrous re-
sults in undermining resistance to in-
fection—a huge dose that failed to con-
trol rejection. Dr. Blaiberg, the second
case, still alive after 5| 'months, is more
fortunate, if reports are accurate, for
he is able to respond to a dose as low
as 45mg. daily.
We do not know who is going to do
well on steroids and who is not. This
is not surprising, since variation in
response to drugs is well known. As an
added complication, the principal ex-
perimental animal in transplant studies,
the dog, does not respond to steroids
at all, so that we appear to have no
way of studying their effect after trans-
plantation except in man.
Nor is there any point in bringing up
kidney transplants as an example. If
a kidney transplant fails, and many do,
the patient can be put on an artificial
kidney machine.
Heart transplantation at the moment
is palliative surgery. It can promise
the patient no more than a very short
extension of life in a carefully con-
trolled environment and in the full
glare of publicity. It may represent a
fine technical feat, but, as I have tried
to show, this is not the issue. The
operation can be done. Ought it to be
done? In my opinion it may be good
surgery, but it is poor medicine.
Other issues are raised, notably the
role of the mass media, especially that
of television. Television has failed,
sometimes sickeningly, to put the issues
clearly to the public and has preferred
to dramatise and glamorise, casting
Professor Barnard almost in the role of
miracle worker. He has been able to
take away what many people think of
as the receptacle of life, the heart, and
put another in its place.
I am no expert in this field there
are very few, anyway but I think a
halt should be called and the whole
question properly assessed. As a doctor,
I believe it would be in the best in-
terest of medicine, as well as the pub-
lic, if this were done.


Biafra and the British conscience
WHILE VIETNAM has been bringing
war into the world’s living-rooms with
the evening TV news, another civil war,
the struggle of the breakaway State of
Biafra to gain independence from
Nigeria, is 'being fought behind a screen
of almost total silence and indifference.
Who can say whether saturation or
suppression will in the long run prove
more dangerously distorting?
It is not surprising that not much is
heard of Biafra. Its side is presented in
the main by the small, ineffectual voice
of an advertising agency in Geneva,
which, as an absolute first in warfare,
ancient or modern, holds the Biafran
“account.” Its opponents, the Gowon
regime, may have little wish to have its
activities publicised.
The third major party involved,
Britain, may have even less. While
British students demonstrate about
American involvement in Vietnam and
seotions of the British Press lecture the
Americans about violence in America,
the British Government has gone on
supplying arms to Nigeria, and Lord
Shepherd, Minister of State for Com-
monwealth Affairs, tells the House of
Lords that to halt the flow of British
arms to Nigeria might encourage Biafra
to fight on rather than negotiate and
that the Federal Government would
merely buy arms elsewhere and give
less heed to British advice.
Again, Britain claims that to stop
arms to Nigeria might cause Africa
to relapse into tribalism while the Scot-
tish and Welsh nationalists seek to
achieve just that for Great Britain.
If there is one lesson which Vietnam
won’t teach us it is that to wash your
hands of an affair will automatically
leave them clean. History may judge
less harshly America’s blunderings into
Vietnatn than it will Britain’s refusal
to take a more active and sympathetic
part in the Nigerian affair. Remote
as Biafra seems from Australia, it may
become the means of judging what the
Wilson Government stands for and 'may
become the way of evaluating finally
what is the use of the British Common-
wealth.
The Biafran affair is not a backyard
squabble. The President of the Ivory
Coast, President Houphouet Boigny,
sa i d reC ently that more people had
been killed in ten months of the Biafran
war than in the past three years in
Vietnam. A final solution to the Ibos,
the main tribe of the eastern region of
Nigeria, is not just a journalist’s phrase,
On May 30, 1967, the eastern region
G f Nigeria declared itself independent
as the Republic of Biafra. This was
after the military takeover in Lagos
of January, 1966, which was followed
j n September of that year by the
massacre of about 30,000 Ibos and the
desperate flight from a similar fate
by an estimated 2,000,000 other Ibos.
(It j s interesting to speculate what
response Britain would have made if
when about the same time Singapore
detached itself from Malaysia, another
country created by the break-up of
t h e British Empire, the Malaysians had
tried to exterminate the Singaporeans.)
Since then thfi Biafran war has con _
tinued with the utmost savagery . Total
deaths are estimated at at least 100,000.

Still the Biafrans try to fight on; noth-
ing could keep them going except the
belief that what lies after surrender
Biafrans in London protesting against British arms sales to Nigeria
would be worse than their present posi-
tion.
Peace talks in Kampala have in
recent months been going on at about
the pace and about as hopefully as
those in Paris. A prime mover in the
talks was Canadian Arnold Smith,
secretary-general of the Commonwealth
Secretariat, whose tea with sympathy
to the delegates made them nickname
the talks the “tea-party.”
On June 18, Nigeria and Biafra
agreed to a temporary ceasefire so that
Red Cross teams could take food to the
starving refugees in the bush. The Red
Cross merely has permission to carry
supplies to the Ibos by land through
Arnold Smith, prime mover
in the peace talks
Federal-held territory and escorted by
Federal troops.
If by something close to a miracle
current negotiations succeed and the
ceasefire becomes permanent it is ex-
pected that Mr. Smith will try to con-
jure up a Commonwealth peace force
which would be permanently set
between the two sides.
Beleaguered Biafra’s list of friends has
been growing. In recent months four
African Governments —Zambia, Tan-
zania, Gabon, and the Ivory Coast—
have all recognised the regime led by
Colonel O.dumegwu Ojukwu. It has
been suggested that Nigeria agreed to
the Kampala talks to forestall other
African recognitions.
President Julius Nyere, of Tanzania,
admitted his was a “difficult decision.”
“In Nigeria the consciousness of a
common citizenship was destroyed by
the events of 1966,” he wrote. “Whether
the Easterners are correct in their be-
lief that they have been rejected (by
other Nigerians) is a matter of argu-
ment. But they do have this belief.
And if they are wrong they have to
be convinced that they are wrong.


They will not be convinced by being
shot.
“As President of Tanzania it is my
duty to safeguard the integrity of the
United Republic. But if the mass of
the people of Zanzibar should, without
external manipulation, and for some
reason of their own, decide that the
Union was prejudicial to their exist-
ence, I could not advocate bombing
them into submission. To do so would
not be to defend the Union. The
Union would have ceased to exist.”
More importantly, both Czechoslo-
vakia and Holland have stopped supply-
ing arms to the Federal forces. The two
principal British assets in Nigeria are
Shell and Unilever, both jointly owned
with the Dutch. Holland’s decision
seems to demolish the British claim that
Britain’s vital commercial interests are
at stake in Nigeria.
Louder voices of protest are being
heard in Britain. The Roman Catholic
Ibo prisoners, taken by Federal troops, roped together in Lagos
Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal
Heenan, in his Whitsunday sermon, and
as the first Catholic since the Reforma-
tion to preach in Westminster Abbey,
spoke about Biafra. “There is a great
deal of selective indignation,” he said.
“Think how many marches and demon-
strations have taken place against the
Americans in Vietnam. But how many
marches and demonstrations have there
been against the massacre in Biafra?”
The British magazine “The Spec-
tator” in recent weeks has become the
strongest voice attacking the British
Government on Biafra. On May 31
“The Spectator” wrote:
“No government in the world bears
as heavy a share of the responsibility
for these horrors as the present Govern-
ment of this country. The Biafrans
seem entirely justified in saying that
without wholehearted British support
and encouragement the Federal side
would have stopped the war long ago.
The Government is apparently con-
scious of its own guilt: it has acted
throughout in secrecy, hiding the facts
from Parliament and country behind a
smokescreen of evasion, obfuscation,
hypocrisy, and specious argument; and
it has utterly refused to reveal the
extent of its commitment and the
volume of its military supplies for
Nigeria,
“The Government’s ‘arguments’ are
contemptible. The Gowon regime, it
says, is the legal government of Nigeria
and, as such, is entitled to buy arms,
But in what way is an unconstitutional
regime that came to power after two
successive military coups more legal
than that of Biafra? And how will
they now justify the hollow 'hypocritical
mockery of refusing arms to South
Africa on the pretext that these may
be used to kill Africans, something the
Federal Nigerians are allowed to do
to their hearts’ content?
“The Government says that Nigeria’s
unity and territorial integrity must be
preserved. Why? Why should entirely
artificial, casually drawn boundaries
remain sacrosanct for evermore, what-
ever the price? And what is Nigeria
itself but an accidental product of
colonisation, a conglomeration of com-
pletely different tribes, whose very
name was invented by the wife of its
first colonial governor? If we were to
stop arms shipments to Nigeria, says
the Government, she would obtain
them from other sources. Possibly so
hut if Hitler had invited foreign
tenders for the construction of his gas
ovens would Britain have applied,
using the same excuse?
“Ninety years ago the Turkish Gov-
ernment began massacring its rebellious
Bulgar subjects. The British ambassador
in Constantinople was in full sympathy
with the Turks, and the British Gov-
ernment of the day also supported
Turkey for reasons of foreign policy
(though to do Disraeli justice he never
supplied the Turks with either encour-
agement or weapons for their atroci-
ties). As the news of the ‘Bulgarian
horrors’ gradually seeped out, the mood
of the country perceptibly changed. It
was William Ewart Gladstone who
brought public indignation to the
boiling-point. In one of his most power-
ful pamphlets he seared the conscience
of the nation: ‘There is not a criminal
in a European jail, there is not a
cannibal in the South Sea Islands,
whose indignation would not arise and
overboil at the recital of that which
has been done, which has too late been
examined, but which remains un-
avenged; which has left behind all the
foul and all the fierce passions that pro-
duced it, and which may again spring
up in another more murderous harvest,
from the soil soaked and reeking with
' blood, and in the air tainted with every
imaginable deed of crime and shame.’
“Can Britain’s conscience really now
be dead? Cannot public opinion yet
compel the Government to renounce its
odious policy toward Biafra?”
Apart from Red Cross relief, the
British organisations Oxfam and War
on Want have regularly been sending
help to the Biafrans through Caritas,
the Roman Catholic international relief
organisation.
Last week the Australian Council of
Churches launched a $25,000 emergency
appeal for Biafra and sent an initial
gift of $5OOO to the council’s head-
quarters in Geneva. It also asked for
doctors, nurses, and social workers to
volunteer to go to Biafra.
Latest reports from Biafra suggest
that present aid is merely the proverbial
drop in a bucket. A Roman Catholic
missionary in Biafra, Father Frank
Devine, who receives regular reports
from more than 300 missionaries in the
area, has reported to Caritas that
present supplies from the Red Cross
average less than a bag of food a
village a month.
“We calculate that Biafra must get
in 200 tons of protein food a day from
now until six months after the end of
the war,” he reports. “This is minimal.
Three hundred to 400 tons a day are
really needed. Otherwise, up to
4,500,000 people are just going to die
in the next few months.”
Biafra’s bitter struggle to the end
tends to cast her in a heroic role, but
who outside knows the rights and
wrongs of a civil war? There has been
long enmity between the Nigerian
regions and much provocation in the
past by the Ibos.
This does not mean that the hungry
must not be fed; Australia must help
there. However, what part will Aus-
tralia play in moves toward an accept-
able settlement? Will she contribute
toward a Commonwealth peace-
keeping force if Arnold Smith manages
to insert one between the two sides?
Rather, can she refuse to contribute to
such a force?
The situation in Nigeria seems to
rule out a Commonwealth Prime
Ministers’ conference this year, if such
a thing had been contemplated. One
can hardly imagine a weekend at
Chequers with Mr. Wilson and Mr.
Gorton and General Gowon. The
situation may also enable Australia to
make up her mind finally what belong-
ing to the British Commonwealth in-
volves. At present it seems to entitle
us to a few MBEs and a visit from one
of the Royals for an occasional bun-
fight. If that is all it means, it may be
fun while it lasts, but it won’t last long.


Don’t scrap the CMF
By J. R. STEVENSON
IN THE MAIN there are three types
of army which allow a measure of
sub-division within their structures.
They are clearly set out in a book,
“The Citizen Army,” by F. M. Stern.
They are described as the Professional
Army, the Cadre-Conscript Army, and
the Citizen-Conscript Army. The latter
is the type used in Switzerland and
Israel and is well worth study in view
of the economic support required.
Your contributor, “Ex-Officer,” pro-
pounds the idea that the CMF is of no
use on certain grounds:
(1) That some members are in
reserved occupations and some are
draft-dodgers, and upon activation each
unit would lose a number of its
personnel. It must be remembered that
even in activation of Regular units
there is always wastage, principally on
medical grounds.
(2) He points out that very few
CMF officers have had recent opera-
tional experience. This would appear
to be no handicap when one recalls
that, in World War 11, Major-General
K. W. Eather commanded 2/lst Bat-
talion at Bardia and Brigadier F. O.
Chilton commanded 2/2nd Battalion.
In my own case, I had exactly 24 hours
in battle as a major before assuming
command of 2/3rd Battalion. It cannot
be said that any of these three Bat-
talions suffered through the Command-
ing Officer not having had operational
experience.
It should be re'membered that in the
Korean conflict eight officers from one
CMF unit alone volunteered and
served there (apart from other units).
(3) “Ex-Officer” questions the
standard of training. .It is readily
admitted that a part-time soldier is not
trained to the same standard as a
soldier who is engaged full-time in
continually carrying out and repeating
certain operations.
“Ex-Officer” fails to mention the
Reserve Force formed by ex-Regular
soldiers, who receive $2OO for the first
year and an increase of $5O each year
thereafter, in addition to the usual
rate of pay for attending a 14-day
camp. Thus, one reservist recently, for a
two-week camp, drew over $4OO without
any responsibility. In contrast to this
expenditure, CMF units providing a
Guard of Honor for Anzac Day cere-
monies are not allowed any expendi-
ture or the use of military vehicles.
A CMF soldier brings to. his task
certain knowledge of his civilian skills
and ability, and in the case of officers
they either hold managerial positions in
most cases or are aspiring executives.
They deal with industrial problems from
day to day, thus developing capacity
in regard to man management, whereas
the Regular officer is protected to a
degree and is not brought into contact
with industrial matters.
The citizen soldier in two World
Wars has been noted for his initiative,
whereas in the Regular Army the
tendency today is for the Regular
soldier to place the emphasis on his
promotion and is less inclined to step
out of line.
The CMF has been accused of taking
up a considerable amount of effort and
time of the Regular Army for instruc-
tional and administrative purposes.
While certain officers are posted to
CMF units, they do not spend their
full time with that unit. Frequently
they are engaged in umpiring Regular
Army exercises and other administrative
duties. For example, a Regular officer
posted as adjutant of a unit is allowed
six weeks’ study leave prior to an
examination. A CMF officer is not in
this happy position; he cannot devote
himself full-time to study prior to an
examination, yet is required to pass the
same examination as set for Regular
officers.
National Service trainees are at the
present time being called up and some
are given the opportunity to attend an
Officers’ Training School at Scheyville
for a 22-week course. After passing
out they attend a further course at
Canungra and then may be posted to
Vietnam. Volunteer enlistments in the
Regular Army, after an induction course
of 13 weeks, complete a further course
in their corps arid then may be also
posted to Vietnam.
The whole problem resolves itself
into obtaining the best value possible for
sums appropriated in the annual Budget.
I consider one solution to the problem
would be to follow the Canadian system
of a complete reorganisation into one
defence force. Thus, economies could be
made in the overlapping of certain
administrative services.
I believe the Army component for
the defence force should be based on a
form of national service. The youth of
today are handed considerable benefits
by our society and they should be pre-
pared to defend that society to the point
of serving it, which involves sacrifice as
an individual. National Service should
be related to community service. The
resentment in the community today at
the existing call-up system is due to the
unfairness of selection, as it is based
upon a selective system. The Australian
attitude is “one in, all in” and I am
certain that if a system were devised
to call up all youth, people would con-
sider it a fair scheme. On the popula-
tion basis, with the teenage explosion,
we have the manpower reserve.
Again, a further resentment is
frequently voiced against the age of
call-up, and it would appear that it
would be more appropriate if the call-
up was at 18 years of age, before the
trainee has embarked upon a tertiary
education system or entered employ-
ment. The Regular Army accepts
volunteers at the age of 18 years at
adult rates of pay.
In ! my opinion, one solution to the
problem of the organisation of the
Army component would be to raise one
Regular division (42,000) with support-
ing arms for overseas commitments,
with a reserve force for home defence
of five CMF divisions (100,000). New
Guinea-Papua should be organised on
a separate structure.
The National Service trainees to be
called up for 11 to 12 weeks’ training,
similar to the scheme abandoned in
1960. In this period of training the
recruit receives his induction and his
basic training. After completion, a
trainee is posted to a CMF unit. The
Regular division, with its high rate of
pay and fringe benefits, such as housing
and medical benefits, should be sus-
tained by volunteer recruits.
And the cost? The five CMF divi-
sions would cost less on an annual
basis than the one Regular division and
the taxpayer would certainly be getting
value for money expended. The divi-
sions would be located territorially,
based on centres of population and with
a responsibility of adjacent areas in a
primary role . . .
A number of Regular personnel who
have been down-graded medically and
others on retirement could be engaged
to recruit a nucleus cadre of instruc-
tors.
It will be realised that the two
standards are complementary, one to
the other, and that the Army is part
of the co’mmunity and not apart from
it. The CMF soldier contributes to the
Army in his everyday knowledge of
community affairs, while the Regular
soldier is inclined to be something apart
from the community; owing to the
nature of his posting he is rarely in
an area for more than two years and,
consequently, does not engage in any
corrimunity activities.

The art of being a writer
By RICHARD CAMERON
THERE IS style in writing and style
in being a writer. At the Melbourne
seminar on writing last week, organised
by the Society of Authors, the con-
trast between the three novelists who
made up the panel of 'the first session
was complete.
There was Peter Mathers in turtle-
neck sweater and soft sports coat, his
head ringed with unruly curls, talking
to his audience with a cigarette bob-
bing in the side of his mouth. He
spoke several times of Norman Mailer.
Could it have been sheer coincidence,
the physical resemblance to Mailer?
Then Tony Morphett pulled himself
up to his full height of six feet six,
with long dark hair and clad in a 'type
of blue denim boiler suit with a brightly
colored sweat-shirt underneath. When
a young girl in the audience asked him
what his singlet represented and he
pulled open the boiler suit to expose
the loud-colored thing, here was Hem-
ingway, the Hemingway who bared his
own hairy chest when he identified
writing with a grunt.
The third of the novelists was
Thomas Keneally. He seemed small,
neat, mild in his conventional collar
and tie, with his conventional manners.
Unmistakably Keneally.
Peter Mathers, the author of the
highly praised worst-seller, “Trap,” has
recently returned after five years away.
He has come back breathing smoke and
fire. The 'task for the writer, he told
the 400-odd people at the seminar, is
to practise sedition.
“Public affairs are so appalling
here, really awful, that satire is abso-
lutely necessary,” he said. “The thing
for the writer is to be subversive. Being
subversive can be a drag, sure, but we
have to do it. When we’re treated like
criminals, then we will know we are
doing our job well.” Some slanderous
remarks about various State Premiers
and well-known public companies
followed.
It didn’t matter who set themselves
up, basically they were all creeps. “But
I do insist on the right to satirise them,
to get the bastards and kick ’em
around,” Mathers said.
As Frank Hardy voiced the occa-
sional penetrating “hear, hear” from
the rear of the Pharmacy College lec-
ture theatre, Mathers went on: “We
have to explode people from the
clutches of mediocrity and do it at the
risk of sounding ridiculous.”
-»He said the essential thing at the
moment was passion. “Not this form/
content thing. If there is one thing we
can learn from the Americans it is
vitality. Irony and wit are fascinating,
but they just don’t exist in Australia.”
Australian authors couldn’t be con-
Mathers ... biting the hand
tent to pant along the Furphy trail.
The naturalistic novel was finished here.
“There are too many reports mas-
querading as novels. Naturalism is a
lost cause —TV does it better.”
Before warming to his theme,
Mathers explained that he had spent a
year until April at Pittsburgh Univer-
sity on a drama fellowship. “The money
was provided by someone called Schu-
bert, who made a mint out of Broad-
way. He felt guilty about what he had
done to American theatre.”
The same sort of thing happened in
Australia. “Sure we might as well take
the money, but we should then turn
round and bite their hands. If we’ve got
rabies, all the better. It’s nice that they
want to help us, but are they being
nice or just cunning?”
Would writers be accused of trendi-
ness? This was not a problem. “Our
problem is that we are not nearly sub-
versive enough. We have to penetrate
all that . . . filthy smog uip there. We
have to do our ‘thing.’ We have to fly
solo ... fly up there and touch the
‘thing.’ ”
Tony Morphett, who spoke before
Mathers, did not have the same assur-
ance about the writer’s role or the
novel’s purpose. “Ten years ago I
thought I knew what the novel was.
Now after three novels I think there
is just novel-length prose. Perhaps
you’ve caught me at a good time. By
next year I won’t know what prose is.”
Morphett insisted that what he had
to do was keep his nerve ends bare,
exposed to what was happening. He
had a more sanguine attitude toward
the writer’s environment. “Armaged-
don lies beyond every conference table.
The world on the brink of suicide is
paradise for the writer.”
Morphett thought Jane Austen was
“a great gal.” “You could fall in love
with her. She wrote good books.”
Thomas Keneally on the other hand
thought the problem lay less with crisis
than with more traditional difficulties
such as the conflict between a vital
prose style and control and authority.
He argued for stylistic restraint. “I
am rather old fashioned. I admire the
simplicity of Evelyn Waugh, who can
get someone out of a room in one
sentence.”
Keneally mainly confined himself to
problems of technique. At the one
extreme, he said, there is the over-
consciously wrought, overornate, too-
rich works of fiction, such as the early
(or earlier) Hal Porter and Thea Astley.
At the other extreme is the self-
conscious simplicity of such writers as
Hemingway and C. P. Snow. Obvi-
ously, he felt, the answer is to strike
a balance between the two. Style
should not intrude, distract, or detract.
It should not come between the reader
and the work.
Keneally, who obviously felt that
many of the writers at the seminar, at
least the young ones, had come for
advice, not exhortation, said another
problem was the manner of preparing
a novel. He felt there were two main
approaches. One was massive afore-
hand preparation—note-taking, work-
ing out plot line, characterising, moti-
vation, course of action, etc. The
other was the spontaneous start with
perhaps only one or two characters
and a single idea, plus the belief that
there was enough vitality in the thing
to develop a novel.
Keneally suggested that the first
method was the less preferable. Its
danger, he felt, was that it can involve
beginning with ideas rather than
characters and action.
Later in the evening there was some
confusion about whether this line of
Keneally’s put him among the “oldies.”
Frank Hardy leaned forward to sug-
gest that he and Keneally could learn
something from the young men on the
stage. Almost sheepishly Keneally
turned his bald pate to say he was only
32. Mathers is four years older.

BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY
All in all, not a bad year
WE GOT THROUGH 1967-68 re-
markably well, really. After all, the
drought in southern Australia (now
well and truly broken by continuing
rains) could, in other circumstances,
have made a nasty dent in Australia’s
prosperity. Rural production fell dur-
ing the year by 12 percent to $3376
million and rural incomes plummeted to
below $9OO million, their lowest level for
a decade. But despite this Australia
came through the year with a rise in
gross national product somewhere near
5J percent (about 4 percent in real
terms) and with its balance of payments
roughly where it was when we came
in (thanks to the massive capital in-
flow of about $llOO million and rising
minerals exports).
Not that the drought failed to leave
its mark. The slower rate of rise in
consumption expenditure shown in the
national income figures for March
quarter and indications of continuing
sluggishness in retail sales since then
seem to be one result of the drought,
as does the plateau in motor vehicles
sales, the surprising \ percent fall in
private fixed capital expenditure in
March quarter (despite the Govern-
ment’s continually stated intentions of
stimulating this sector since it set out
to do so in last year’s budget), and,
of course, the barely steady level of
export income.
But at least one thing can be said
for all this; it left the economy in a
nice state of balance, with no excessive
pressures on resources and no evidence
of demand inflation. The labor market
shows no signs of getting too tight (in
fact, the immobility of labor between
States has produced conflicting trends
of higher unemployment and increased
unfilled vacancies). Monetary policy is
still in “neutral,” the boom psychology
of the stockmarkets (up two-thirds last
year) has not spilled over into the
economy at large, and there now seems
little prospect of the Government go-
ing ahead with its earlier threat of
taking the fiscal fist to the economy by
increasing taxes in its August budget.
This does not deny that there may
be a need for some restraint later in
the year, as farm incomes are restored,
export income rises, consumer spending
increases, and capital expenditure re-
covers, especially as all these will take
place against the inflationary back-
ground of a cost-push set of wage rises.
But the National Bank, for one, sees
no reason for getting tough yet.
In any event, the new financial year
should be a better one for growth
than 1967-68, as the non-farm sector
will not have to carry all the burden
(in March quarter, for instance, non-
farm GNP rose by nine percent, but
the fall in farm incomes reduced the
total rise in GNP to only 2 percent), as
minerals exports should rise further
(last year they jumped from $370 mil-
lion' to $531 million), and as GNP
should rise by about 9 percent (or
around 6 percent in real terms) accord-
ing to official estimates. And with State
grants and loans being limited at the
recent Loan Council meeting to a 9 per-
cent rise (in line with projected GNP),
then it could be that there will be scope
for the private sector to move ahead.
But one thing is clear: we will again
need a huge level of capital inflow to
hold the balance of payments situation
as another current account deficit (on
top of 1967-68’s huge $lOOO million)
is certain. The big question for policy-
makers is going to be how much can
they afford the country to overspend
on external account against current
income in 'the hope that rising mineral
exports will eventually bail us out.
There are some commentators who
fear that recent heavy current account
deficits will not be ended simply by a
heavy increase in mining exports in
coming years; some projections of a
halving in the average rate of advance
of rural exports and expressions of con-
Rural output down 12 percent
cern about the future of world trading
unless the gold crisis is finally solved or
about the likely market for Australian
mining products in the event of peace
in Vietnam dearly suggest that, every-
thing may not be as rosy •■jf’as. the
Government sees it.
But there is a lot to be said for
Mr. McMahon’s “be of good cheer”
message of last week. His point that a
great deal of serious-looking import
demand was simply a function of the
inflow of foreign investment indicates
that if capital inflow dropped so would
the imports of equipment that it was
financing. And he also thought that the
capital inflow was not all that it was
cracked up to be; some part of it may
prove to have been leads and • lags in
current payments: items bought “on
tick” bring a consequential “capital
inflow” to pay for them. This is not .to
deny that there are risks involved 'for
Australia in its current policy. But that
is life.
Protectionism
Learning from other people's disasters
EVEN EUROPEANS know that the
Common Market’s agricultural pro-
tection policies are a disaster. So there
is not much consolation in knowing
that Australia’s protectionist policies
are not quite as bad as theirs. But.it
is the sort of comfort that Trade
Minister McEwen gave last week’s
annual meeting of the N.S.W. Branch
of the Country Party.
There is one major difference be-
tween the two protectionist policies,
however, that Mr. McEwen did not
point out. That was the fact that the
European authorities are desperately
trying to do something about the absur-
dities of their arrangements, while the
Australian Government seems fairly
well satisfied with the present system
of Australian protectionism. (It has
hardly been encouraging to the Tariff
'Board in its “classification” project, for
instance.)
As much as the present agricultural
policies of the Common Market smack
of disgraceful self-interest (particularly
in their impact on developing coun-
tries), there can be no escaping the
situation that the members of the
European Economic Community had
to start somewhere in restructuring
their rural industries into one com-
munity. The intention has been that
the levels of tariffs, levies, and quotas
should be only enough to enable the
least efficient producers of %the EEC
to survive while attempts were made
to re-allocate rural resources into a
more sensible “European” rather than
national pattern.
But it has been neither politically


nor administratively possible to do this
restructuring in the EEC’s 10-year his-
tory; it has been such a struggle to get
even the outlines of a common agricul-
tural policy that it only came into
effect in full last year. And even after
voting their farmers the highest set of
farm prices in the developed world
EEC farm incomes remain one-third
lower than non-farm incomes.
Now the reforms must become pos-
sible. A 90 percent self-sufficiency in
food coupled with the brake on de-
mand created by the high prices and
the threat of farmers increasing pro-
duction is already generating embar-
rassing surpluses. If things go on as
they are, butter stocks alone will have
reached the fantastic level of 750,000
tons by 1972.
The problem is to find some way to
reduce the common prices, or at least
not let them increase, without lower-
ing the farmers’ standard of living.
In other words, to find ways and means
of lowering the farmers’ costs; and
everyone in Australia should know just
what that means and how slow and
difficult it is to achieve.
On minimal assumptions about half
of the 6 million farmers within the
community are surplus to the require-
ments of efficient agriculture, so there
is plenty of scope along consolidation
lines, and money for this and other
improvements is available:
Structural improvement programs
1967-69
SU.S.
million
Development of backward areas 130
Reorganisation of farm land
into more economic units 70
Irrigation 50
Drainage 50
Afforestation of marginal land 12
Improvement of production and
distribution in:
Dairying 100
Meat 90
Fruit and vegetables 80
Olive oil 50
Wine 40
Total 672
The scale of the problem is enor-
mous and reforms, though they may
achieve a long-run success, will un-
doubtedly hurt—or seem to hurt —a
considerable number of people in an
area where something like 20 percent
of the electorate is dependent on
farming. But political considerations
for votes are being rapidly outweighed
by the political embarrassments of the
massive surpluses which are develop-
ing.
For Australia, the ills of agricultural
protectionism are not so severe as in
the EEC, though this is hardly enough
reason for Mr. McEwen to generate
complacency over the matter. There
is, after all, plenty of room for reforms
in the industries here, and with only
about 7 percent of the electorate
directly involved there is less political
excuse for not implementing them.
MEN AND MATTERS
RATIONALISATION of the rope in-
dustry was called for in the Tariff
Board’s report last month and that is
precisely the motive behind the merger
of James Miller Holdings and
Donaghys, two of the oldest Australian
rope firms, which was put into effect
at the end of June.
Neither of the two merged com-
panies is wholly occupied with rope
and twine these days, though at least
in the case of Miller’s, the Melbourne
based concern, there is a suggestion that
its earnings rate would be distinctly
higher had it stuck to these and not
launched itself into more glamorous
areas such as producing yarns for
tufted carpets.
These days, rope and twine account
for about 30 percent of Miller’s turn-
over, so by linking with the Geelong
show, Donaghys, just under two : thirds
of whose trade is in these, it will look
more like the business originally in-
tqnded when two Scotsmen, James
Mr. Peter
De Burgh
Hogg
Miller and Alexander Gray, started it
106 years ago.
Soon after its foundation they were
joined by a third partner, another
Scotsman, Peter Hogg, the great grand-
father of the present managing-director,
44-year-old Peter De Burgh Hogg, who,
with his brother Tom, represents the
fourth generation of the Hogg family
on the board.
It is a tradition in the James Miller
business that any son of a director
aspiring to enter it must acquire a
university degree or a technical diploma,
which is what the present managing-
director did when he left Scotch
College for the Engineering School at
Melbourne University, from which he
graduated in 1944.
He was received into the firm in
1945 and his father made him start
his climb up the firm’s ladder from
the very bottom. By 1948 he was
heading the technical and development
division already with three months ex-
perience at James Mackie and Sons, a
leading Belfast rope and textile maker,
under his belt. Succession to chief
executive’s job came as much by dint
of hard work as of natural right.
Mr. Hogg lives at North Ringwood
with his wife and three children (one
at university) and relaxes with tennis
and golf.
THE NEWLY appointed chairman of
British-owned Doulton Potteries (Aus-
tralia) Pty. Ltd., Fred W. Millar, may
need all his legal expertise to win the
takeover battle for local sanitary-ware
group R. Fowler Ltd.
His first problem, of getting $4.5
million cash for the takeover, is all
solved, despite the UK Government’s
restrictions on the export of capital.
But under the chairmanship of account-
ant-cum-professional director Raymont
Moore, Fowler will not succumb with-
out a struggle, as is evidenced by its
readiness to dispense a one-for-four
bonus by way of evasive tactics.
Fred Millar has a string of director-
ships to rival Raymont Moore’s, but
his entree to the boardroom was as a
lawyer rather than an accountant. At
45, he is retiring from Allen Allen and
Hemsley, that doyen of Sydney legal
firms, after 22 years’ association.
He is currently eliminating a few r
directorships to concentrate on chairing
Mr. Fred
Millar
Doulton (with which he has been
associated since they first formed in
this country), Australian Hoechst and
Hoechst Chemicals (Australia), Bliss
Welded Products, Royal Sovereign
Pencil and Co. (Australia), and
Thompson Publications, and keeping a
seat on several other boards.
Millar’s involvement in the company
side of law developed out of his in-
terest in it. He can’t even remember
his first directorship. But his first role
in the public arena was as a member
of an advisory committee set up by the
Receiver and Trustee for the deben-
ture-holders of Reid Murray in 1963.
Born in Albury, the son of a brick-
layer, he graduated LL.B in Sydney
after the war. But his business career
started in 1939 in the Attorney-
General’s office, where, in his own
words, he was a humble junior clerk.
In 1941 he joined the Navy, serving
in the destroyer Napier in the South
Atlantic and Indian Ocean, and sub-
sequently in the corvette Lithgow.
During his navy stint he started study-
ing law. He says there is always time
for such things, even if at 3 o’clock
in 'the morning.
An obvious demon for work, Millar’s
pastimes are energetic ones; breeding
Aberdeen Angus at Major’s Creek, near
Braidwood, and skiing at Perisher and
Charlotte’s Pass and occasionally in
Europe, which he visits two or three
times a year.

The Croesus Touch
LOOKINF THE GIFT HORSE
OF CAPITAL INFLOW
CLOSELY IN THE MOUTH
BY J. C. HORSFALL
IN THE RELATIVELY happy state
of the economy nobody wants to look
the gift horse of massive capital inflow
too closely in the mouth. But in
planning the Budget, which, as matters
stand at the moment, is going to involve
us in $350 million overseas defence
spending (just more than one quarter
of the total estimated Defence Bill)
this year, the Treasurer will be forced
to.
The plain fact is that in 1967-68
far too big a proportion of the capital
inflow has been going into share pur-
chases for the Treasurer’s and the
economy’s comfort, and far too little
of it has been finding its way into fixed
investment. It is not understating its
importance to the Budget to say that
the trend and make-up in capital inflow
are the most formidable background
elements in the economic considerations
now posed for Mr. McMahon in his
pre-Budget exercises.
Taking the most optimistic view of
the matter, the Treasurer will feel that
the attractions for overseas portfolio
investors have permanent quality
stemming from boundless economic
prospects here in general and those in
minerals development in particular.
Taking this attractive line he could
well argue that, for the most part, funds
for portfolio investment .already in
position here will stay with us. Such
a possibility is not easily disputed, but
there is simply no way of telling what
will happen when the current share
boom subsides (it looked to be a little
tired last week in fact), or even when
the scope for capital appreciation in
minerals shares is more exactingly
viewed against tangible earnings
potentials of the companies concerned.
(At present, prices of a lot of shares
which have been pushed up primarily
because of overseas demand are dis-
counting only pie in the sky.)
To put it at its lowest, however, it
would be at least prudent for the
Treasurer when budgeting for this year
to reckon on a certain amount of
repatriation of funds now in shares
here. This would have to be set against
his considered expectations of what
additional funds are likely to come in
for portfolio investment. Apropos of
this it would be a good idea if the
Commonwealth Statistician separated
portfolio investment from institutional
investment instead of lumping them
together in his figures for annual over-
seas investment in Australia, so as to
give us a clear idea of fluctuations in
portfolio investment, which is poten-
tially the most volatile of all capital
inflow. Even if Mr. McMahon is not
in the dark on the division, most of his
critics are.
It isn’t difficult to establish the nexus
between capital inflow, the Budget,
and the economy. It would go broadly
like this. So far as capital inflow adds
to our overseas reserves (even if in
the end it proves to have been sent
here only for a ride in our share
markets and consequently withdrawn
when the ride is over), it helps us to
run our almost perennial deficits on
the overseas current account, so sustain-
ing the flow of overseas resources to
stiffen the Budget and the economy.
As the Treasurer well knows, the latter
are the better for its help in financing
development if it doesn’t carry the
question mark of possible withdrawal.
What we want most is for it to stay
here permanently, coming either as
direct investment in companies (even
when only in form of inter-
company balances in favor of overseas
parents because, as a general rule, most
of these balances are eventually capital-
ised) or as long-term investment by
overseas institutions. From the angle of
keeping the money here (but perhaps
not from other angles) it doesn’t matter
all that much if overseas funds come in
simply to buy our Australian-owned
companies. Such moves entail per-
manent investment in Australia just as
surely as direct investment in estab-
lished branches and subsidia ies of over-
seas companies operating in this
country. By the same token, the effects
of the servicing of capital inflow of
both types on the future balance of
payments is similar. As hinted above,
it can only be hoped that, whatever
the nature of the question marks over
portfolio investment, the Treasurer has
at hand from the statistician a much
more complete breakdown of com-
ponents of last year’s capital.
Going on the behaviour of local
shares under overseas leads, outsiders
would probably tend to overstate the
element of potentially volatile portfolio-
investment capital resting here at the
moment and, taking a cue from tin*
very moderate rise in private fixed-
capital investment over the past year,
would probably tend to understate the
proportion of direct investment in
companies’ capital inflow as a whole
over the period. For Budget purposes
the exercise of estimating what drain on
resources availability will ensue from
the repatriation of last year’s inflow of
capital is not, however, as important
as the attempt the Treasurer must
make to estimate how the inflow of
capital is likely to run this year. But
both exercises have a decisive influence
on the Budget calculations, or at least
they should have. The Federal
Treasury’s own hypothecating failure to
get a fairly satisfactory result from such
exercises could react on the Budget
and, in turn, on rates of economic
activity and development in either of
two directions.
In the first place, if the results err
on the optimistic side, throwing up the
possibility of a bigger contribution to
resources from net overseas capital
movements, this would tempt the
Treasurer to frame an uninhibited
Budget giving more stimulus to the
economy than the actual course of
capital movements might warrant, thus
courting inflation. On the other hand,
if the answers err on the pessimistic side
for net-capital inflow this year, the
Treasurer would be obliged to bring
down a restraining hand in the Budget.
In that event he would run the risk
that given a better course of capital
inflow than predicted, some resources
would be left unused over the year.
Some recent letters to The Bulletin
have suggested that this is in fact what
happened last year. But even looking-
hard at the crystal ball, who, last
August, would have seen in it the flood-
tide of overseas capital inflow that
eventually reached us? Like the rest of
us, Mr. McMahon didn’t, and this may
account for the fact that at least some
of the inflow failed to have a bene-
ficent affect on economic activity and
development.

Must be a link missing here.
Any area of your business relying on
"blotter calculation"? Then, frankly, you
have a link missing. A vital link in a
system planned not only to cut out such
risky "blotter calculations", put 7 to bring
you a dramatic increase in overall effici-
ency and hence contribute to a greater
profitability.
For instance, our experts can after
a fact-finding survey plan a Link-
System for you in which you link a
Remington Calculator to a Remington
accounting machine linked to a Rem-
ington Rotaprint.
Even with the basic system you would
be in an advantageous position of being
able to calculate, handle all book-keeping
details, typing, and at the same time
print all necessary documents even
in colour.
Get the idea ? And whatever Link-
System you may need, we also guarantee,
without cost to you, to train your staff
(including EDP people) to efficiently
operate that system. Your enquiry will
be given our experts' complete concen-
tration. And security. All obligation-free
of course.

The economy .’ Australia’s economy could expand by as
much as 8 percent in real terms next financial year,
according to an ANZ Bank economist. Total rural produc-
tion fell 12 percent in the past financial year, most markedly
in wheat . . . Interest rates on trading bank fixed deposits
have been raised by one-quarter of one percent . . . The
Federal Government agreed to give the States a better
deal on loan fund allocations in 1968-69 . . . Prime Minister
Gorton bluntly asserted the right of the Commonwealth
to veto forms and levels of State taxation.
The only State to fail to share in the improved building
approval figures for May was South Australia; generally
there was strong improvement in dwellings and commercial
building figures . . . and all major motor makers recorded
strong sales improvements in May, total sales going from
37,101 in April to a record 44,299 for May.
The markets.' Investors and punters straightened their
accounts for June 30, and prices tumbled on small volume,
taking the Sydney all-ordinaries index down to 591.55 on
Wednesday; Brisbane’s oil index slipped to 392.13 . . .
Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart, and Perth Stock Exchanges
closed for a “lay-day” on Friday, but Sydney and Brisbane
provided a market place, and buying pressure put the
prices up smartly Friday morning before some profit-
taking . . . The Sydney all-ordinaries index finished strong
at 601.17, non-ferrous metals at 3529.02, and Brisbane
oils at 453.35, compared with 595.91, 3547.57, and 429.47
respectively a week ago.
In the largest single-share-option deal ever made, a buyer
outlayed $90,000 for calls on 30,000 Western Mining
shares, assuming they will exceed $lB in six months . . .
Reckitt and Colman (ex-Big Sister) made its debut at
$4.55, 5c up on the last traded price.
In London, currency fears tended to offset the favorable
factors of good export hopes and comment by the U.S.
Brookings Institute. The currency fears brought buyers back
to gold shares. Australian mines fluctuated sharply,
declining on fears for the closure of the financial year,
rallying on fresh optimism over expected exploration
statements, and then dropping again.
Caution was the motto of the week on Wall Street with
prices moving irregularly lower in active trading. Brokers
attributed the lacklustre trend to the absence of any
significant economic or international news.
Companies’ In W.A., Swan Brewery lifted profit 13.6
percent, year to March . . . while in N.S.W. Tooth and Co.
experienced a slight sales downturn, which may be only
running down of stocks after last year’s industrial trouble
. . . L. J. Hooker would replace the Hotel Metropole with
a major office block if it succeeds in its $4.5 million bid . . .
Travelodge has joined forces with Burns Philp and its
associate Queensland Insurance to develop certain motels in
Australia, Fiji, and the south-west Pacific . . . Motelier’s
takeover talks with a major overseas company have fallen
through.
Life Savers has joined the American Beech-Nut Life
Savers Inc. to make a new chewing-gum in Australia . . .
Shelley’s Drinks earned better in the April six months.
James Hardie made a marginal improvement in absolute
profit and earning rate in the year to March. Realty
Development and Mortgage Co. plans its fifth share issue

Mystery buyer of the Mick Simmons parcel was
revealed as Nelson Trading Co. Pty. The Attorney-General
of N.S.W. announced an investigation of the recent share
dealings by which Mr. Peter Warner and associates sold
their controlling interest.
Intercolonial Boring sold and earned more in the half
year to April. The chairman of F. and T. Industries
(the erstwhile Felt and Textiles) said the company would
earn at least as well in 1967-68 as in previous year.
Colgate-Palmolive Pty. Ltd. lifted dividend to the U.S. parent
from $1.7 million to $2.4 million.
Prospects of the Esso-BHP Tuna A-l well were enhanced
by gas, condensate, and oil shows below 6300 feet, more
than 100 feet higher than the previous oil show . . . and
there was an oil show in Snapper . . .
Peko-Wallsend’s subsidiary, Mount Morgan, is re-
equipping its mine at a cost of S4J million to counter
higher costs, lower grades of ore, and, possibly, lower

Speculator’s Diary
ENTERING THE YEAR OF
THE GIANTS WITH
A COUPLE OF RUMORS
AN INCREASINGLY popular opinion
among those who are supposedly
knowledgeable in these matters is that
1968/69 will see a continuation of the
boom—but on a much more selective
basis. This, they feel, will be the year
of the big ones—the BHPs, the Western
Minings, the Pekos, and the other
solids.
BHP is and has been for some time
the subject of two rumors (the stuff
that "markets and dreams are made of).
Both, in my opinion, could be quite
profitably given more consideration than
the usual run-of-the-mill rumor.
The first is that the company is soon
going to have a share issue. And in
view of the fact that BHP will soon
need cash, and loads of it, to develop its
new oil and gas divisions, and that its
shareholders are the logical ones to
supply it, the rumor would seem to
be a good deal more than just a
reasonable hope. The only question is,
of course, how much the company
wants and when it wants it. It does seem
feasible, however, to assume that any
issue made will be on an instalment
basis so that the company can gear
its increased dividend commitments to
sotne sort of pay-as-you-earn system.
Even BHP would not want to serve
large slugs of capital until it had it
out working and providing the goods
and the profits.
The other rumor about BHP is that
it will shortly follow Western Mining
and split its shares into smaller
units. Although there is not quite the
same logical support for this theory
as there is for the new issue, there are
still many sound reasons why such a
course of action could eventuate. A
cheaper BHP share would undoubtedly
be much more convenient and attractive
to investors as a whole. As it stands at
the moment, many s’maller investors
feel that they simply cannot “afford”
BHP and many of them hesitate to
place an order because they consider
that their few hundred dollars would
not buy a “respectable” parcel. If the
shares were split, it could reasonably
be expected that prices would do a
spiral. Not that splitting a company’s
shares makes it worth any more, in
theory that is, but as facts and history
show the psychological effect of a com-
pany having cheaper shares does tend
to bring out more and keener buyers
and always with the same inevitable
result.
Thus, if either rumor eventuates,
BHP shareholders will have it made.
Either way, there will be cheaper BHP
shares on the market (split, partly paid,
or rights) and shareholders will enjoy
the inherent advantages. On the other
hand, if there is an issue, the share-
holders will be sitting on clover, any-
way. From all angles, both technical
and fundamental, BHP looks to be a
good buy, even at today’s prices. I
consider my holding bought back in
March this year to be one of the best
prospects in the portfolio.
Another group of shareholders that
look as though they could also do well
this year are the shareholders of Frigrite
Ltd. one of the largest manufacturers
of air-conditioning and refrigeration
units in Australia. Up until now the
company has had rather a checkered
career, including two rather hefty losses
in 1963 and 1964- and a sizable profit
dip in 1966. Since then, however, the
group has undergone substantial re-
organisation and it now looks as though
it could be ready to pay dividends.
Shareholders will no doubt say, “and
about time.” They haven’t had one since
1963. Nevertheless, all the indications
are that the company is now about to
come good. Its performance over the
last 18 months has been rather impres-
sive. Last year the company earned
$221,000. This was its second-best profit
ever. The best was way back in 1962
when it earned $262,000 (on the same
capital as today). This year, however,
profits look like eclipsing even the 1962
high.
In the six months to December, 1967,
Frigrite increased sales by 10 percent
and turned in a profit of $lBl,OOO.
This was over 30 percent higher than
the corresponding figure of 12 months
earlier. And not only was the interim
profit higher, but the whole tone of the
company’s report was one of cheerful
confidence. For instance, the report
mentioned that the company was now
representing its old friend of many
years’ standing Barber-Colman, of the
U.S., not only in air-conditioning equip-
ment (as it had done previously) but
also in industrial controls. This move,
it considered, would give the company
new profits and an “in” with the oil
refineries, the natural gas pipeline com-
panies, and the chemical industry. See-
ing that the company now appears set
for several years of good profits, and
that the price of its shares is well below
half of what it was back in 1962 when
the company was earning the same sort
of profits (or less) with the same capi-
tal, I bought 400.

WILD CAT PAGES
But not as good as last year
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
THERE IS ONE forecast that can
be made with confidence about 1968-
69: It will not be as good as 1967-68.
The 66 percent jump in the Sydney
share-price index will not be re-
peated this year (and the index does
not fully represent 1967-68’s rise, as
it leaves out the 189 percent jump in
oil stocks recorded by Brisbane and
also excludes nickel leader Western
Mining and iron-ore king Hamersley
Iron). This does not mean that the new
financial year will be a dull one; far
from it. The pace of mineral and oil
discoveries is likely to be maintained or
even exceeded, with the first day of
the new financial year setting the pace
by bringing a report of major new
nickel finds by CRA-New Broken
Hill-Anaconda. With so much money
now being spent on the search, there
will be enough good news to keep the
market bubbling along for a long time.
But there will not be the same basic
change in investment approach that
brought the massive 1967-68 rise.
There are no really cheap oil stocks
left, but even at current prices there
are going to be some impressive rises
when this year’s wells strike oil. At
the same time, the price of many oil
stocks already takes into account their
chances of success pretty fully; a few
big failures to strike oil could lead to
some severe price reductions.
The investment (non-mining) share
market looks healthy, and is soundly
based on improving company profits
and prospects. The 25 percent rise in
investments (excluding oil-struck BHP)
in 1967-68 provided one-third of Syd-
ney’s index rise. This financial year
should see greater improvements in
pastoral, transport, and automotive in-
dustry stocks, as the industrial sector
should follow the lead set by a boom-
ing commercial sector in 1967-68.
THE CHARTIST ends the current
financial year with continued optimism.
The overall picture suggests that
generally “bullish” conditions will con-
tinue for some time yet.
THIS YEAR may see the turning of
the tide. Every preceding winner of
the Australian Institute of Manage-
ment’s annual award for the best annual
report has subsequently gone through a
disappointing spell on the stock market.
But the news that Ampol Petroleum
Ltd. is the winner is unlikely to be
followed by sorry times for the com-
pany.
For the tide that has turned for
Ampol is a tide of oil from its 63 per-
cent subsidiary, Ampol Exploration’s,
one-seventh interest in Wapet.
Its problems could probably be solved
fairly soon without oil; even last year
its profit of $6.3 million (but after pay-
ing no tax) before adding in the Wapet
earnings was enough to provide
(modest) cover for the $5.6 million
dividend charge. At normal tax the
profit would not have been enough.
But in the first half of the current
year (the six months to March) the
company earned $4.7 million after $2
million tax compared with a tax-free
$2.6 million in the same period of last
year. With Barrow contributing about
$1 million of this before tax, it left
the refining and retailing operations
just about doubling their pre-tax con-
tribution compared with a year ago.
And it suggests that, with Barrow pour-
ing in the cash, the full 1967-68 year
could see Ampol’s profit after tax at
around the $lO million mark, to give
an earning rate of 17 percent or 9
cents a share to cover dividends of 5
cents a share.
One question remaining, however, is
just where the company’s non-oilfield
profit actually comes from. Its accounts
are surprisingly uninformative for a
company that won the balance sheet
award.
Its parent company, which looks like
carrying the bulk of the group’s petrol
retailing, judging by the size of its
assets, turned in another loss (of about
$4 million) last year, leaving it up to
the Victorian and Queensland sub-
sidiaries, presumably, to provide some
cracking figures (unhampered by the
probable losses the parent suffered on
its tanker operations) in petrol retail-
ing. There is no indication of what sort
of profit the company earned from its
new refinery at Lytton, which it says is
a profitable venture. Presumably it will
be even more so in the future, as its
teething problems now seem to be over.
And the company also fails to say in its
accounts exactly how much it received
from its 25 percent holding in the Aus-
tralian Lubricating Oil Refinery
although this information is publicly
available.
But the present excitement over
Ampol that has pushed the shares up
from 57c to $1.55 in little more than a
year (those who bought on The
The Chartist says:
GEORGE HUDSON HOLDINGS is a recovery situation well worthy of investors’
attention on technical grounds. Prices followed a major downtrend until late 1967
from a high of 6/4 in 1960 to a low of 10c. Heavy buying volume broke the down-
trend in November, 1967, and prices moved up to 19c. Consolidation took place
around the 20c level until recently, when a 120 percent uptrend was again “tested”
at 17c in May of this year, and prices have moved up strongly to a high of 30c
during the current week. The base consolidation suggests targets of 40c, 45c, 70c
and a mere optimistic objective of 80c. Last sale price on 27/6/68 —30 c.

Bulletin s advice then would be doing
mcely now), has very little to do with
its petrol retailing or refining opera-
tions. It is mainly Barrow Island,
with 70 cents of Ampol s present price
representing the value of its shares of
Ampol Exploration, its 63.9 percent sub-
sidiary, leaving the rest of the company
in the market at about 85 cents. This
looks a bit cheap for earnings of 5 cents
a s^are to give a price-earnings ratio
on non-oilfield operations of about 17
times on last year’s profit that is certain
to be significantly improved in future
especially as taxation can prob-
abl be held at very ] ow levels for quite
some time through the use of repeated
issues of shares in Ampol Exploration
to finance the continuing search for oil.
And, in any event, it seems that the
craziest days of competition in petrol
retailing may be ended, notwithstanding
some rumblings in Victoria,
There is good reason for the market’s
enthusiasm over A'mpol’s oil search
operations on two scores. In the first
place, Barrow Island’s contribution to
profits is rising rapidly; last year it
kicked in with $451,299 on an average
production rate of 14,500 barrels a day
and it is building this rate up to around
35,000 barrels a day, which should be
achieved in a few months’ time. At
this rate (and if the company’s profit
per barrel is unchanged from last
year’s) then Ampol should receive
s2| million pre-tax, or an extra 35 per-
cent on to last year’s profit. Of course,
this rate may not last; the incentive
pay’ment of $1 or so a barrel which
would make up about half Ampol’s
share of the Wapet profit seems likely
to be cut after 1970.
The effect of a reduction in the
incentive to half its present level (but
leaving in the quality differential)
would be to chop something like a
quarter off Ampol’s likely oilfield
profits. This would mean a reduction
in pre-tax profits per share from oil
(at the 35,000-barrel-a-day rate from
Barrow Island alone) from 2 cents to
lj cents and the price-earnings ratio
based on the 70-cents-a-share oil con-
tent of the stock fro'm 35 times to 47
times.
Offsetting this drop is the latest
news that the water-injection system
being applied to Barrow has upgraded
the field from 114 million barrels to
“more than 200 million barrels,” and
this could presumably bring further
increases in the annual production rate.
On top of this, it is still likely that
Barrow Island could end up with re-
serves closer to 300 million barrels (as
was forecast a few months ago in The
Bulletin) if the water-injecting process
does as well as is hoped. On balance, it
seems that Barrow is probably worth
30 cents a share to Ampol.
Nevertheless, all this shows that
Ampol is partly a speculative stock; it
is not worth current prices on what it
already has, and part of its price is in
the hope that it will turn up a new
oilfield. Something like 40 cents a share
remains as its speculative content. But
40 cents seems a very small price to
pay to get into the search for oil in
probably the most promising area of
Australia outside Bass Strait. There is
every prospect that Ampol will turn up
at least 40 cents worth of good news
in coming months (which also infers
that Ampol Exploration appears a first-
rate speculative stock for those who can
afford a greater risk).
So Ampol, with only about 40 cents
of its $1.55 current price “at risk” in
the search for oil, is the safest oil search
stock in the market. Another good dis-
covery could have a magnificent impact
on the group’s earnings; another
Barrow, which is a fairly modest field,
would alone be enough to justify cur-
rent prices. And there are reported to
be good prospects of Wapet coming up
with something at least as good as
Barrow (and possibly a lot better) as
its offshore search intensifies in a few
months’ time when its new rig arrives.


Saving tax the mining way
NOW IS THE time to make out taxation returns for the financial year that ended last week. A large source
of deductions from taxable income last year will be the many new issues and calls on contributing shares made
by mining companies, as the mining boom encouraged heavy expenditure on exploration. Holders of shares in
the companes who made deductible payments during the past year will be claiming these in their taxaton returns
as a handy bonus on top of the profits, both real and paper, that they have made in the oil and mining markets.
But how much of these payments is allowable as a taxation deduction? Sydney stockbrokers Patrick & Co. have
prepared a table for clients detailing all the deductible payments made in both the oil and mining markets in the
past year, and outlining how much of each payment can be claimed. The lists are as follows:

Security analysis
To Lempriere, all metals glisten
AUSTRALIA’S LARGEST producer
of printing metals and solders and a
significant producer of other white and
red metal alloys and other metal
products originated in a business
started in Melbourne in 1870. W. J.
Lempriere, the founder, was the grand-
son of Thomas Lempriere, a Hobart
merchant, who had emigrated from the
Channel Islands in 1822. The youngest
son of W. J. Lempriere, Oscar Tondeur
Lempriere, joined the firm in 1896,
and by 1914 was the sole Lempriere in
the business.
In 1916 the firm was reconstituted
under the name of O. T. Lempriere &
Co., and in 1923 a tin smelter was
installed at Alexandria (Sydnev). The
company changed over from being a
straight dealer in metals and ores into
a more diversified operation, with
manufacturing becoming the primary
source of income, and operations were
extended to embrace the production of
white metal alloys type metals,
bearing alloys, solders, and the reclama-
tion of white metal drosses and scrap.
This was later followed by the smelting
of antimony ore (in 1934) and later
still the manufacture of various classes
of copper-base alloys such as gunmetals,
bronzes, and their reclamation from
scrap.
The company went public in March,
1949; at the time of the prospectus
Total Assets Employed amounted to
$1.2 million, and Net Earnings after
tax in 1948 was slightly in excess of
$59,000. Over the intervening two
decades to 1967, Total Assets were to
grow by 3.5 times and Net Earnings
by 3.8 times. The Lempriere family
influence remained strong, with O. T.
Lempriere staying on as chairman
until his death in 1955 at the age of
84. The Lempriere family are still
prominent shareholders in the company,
locking away about 20 percent of the
capital, and A. H. Turner, O. T. Lem-
priere’s son-in-law, represents the
family on the board as deputy-
chairman. Mr. Turner, a director since
1938, was managing director of the
public company from 1949 to 1962.
With the recent retirement of E. A.
Andrews, the former chief executive
who was 49 years in the company’s
employment, E. D. Goss, 51, has just
been appointed managing director.
Until very recently, tin refining and
merchanting dominated the company’s
business, but with sharp fluctuations in
international prices, profits often see-
sawed from year to year, and it was
decided to diversify into a wider range
of metal products to establish a much
stronger and stable income base. Since
1957, the company has made eight
acquisitions, the latest of which was
Balcomb Metal Products, a scrap-metal
dealer in Newcastle this was in
March, 1968. With group manufactur-
ing concentrated in the original Alex-
andria plant and also at Footscray
(Melbourne) and Salisbury North
(Brisbane), and with distribution points
extending to all mainland capital cities,
the company is one of the major metal
dealers and processors in Australia.
Group employment is around 350.
The sale of the Lempriere tin
refinery as at March, 1967, to a new
consortium, Associated Tin Smelters
Pty. Ltd., in which the company is a
one-third partner with BHP and
the Patino-dominated Consolidated Tin
Smelters as joint partners has tended
to confuse the stock market, which
has assumed that this will deprive the
company of a very significant propor-
tion of its income. Le'mpriere and
Sydney Smelting Co., a member of the
Consolidated Tin Smelters group, were
the only two tin smelters in Australia,
and the rationalisation was financially
justified, as the relatively limited ton-
nage of tin concentrates produced in
Australia and available to the two
previously competing smelters was
'making refining uneconomic in the face
of rising costs. BHP is the principal
user of tin in Australia, and, according
to the Bureau of Mineral Resources,
takes about 60 percent of the Australian
output in the production of tinplate.
To O. T. Lempriere, tin refining was
representing less than 5 percent of
its group profit in 1966, and the loss
of income from the formation of the
joint venture was of no immediate con-
sequence. Lempriere will continue to
market the refined tin throughout Aus-
tralia as distributors of Associated Tin
Smelters, and in due time should com-
mence to receive dividends from the
joint venture.
In the current composition of Lem-
priere’s business, red metals (copper-
based metals) are slightly in the lead,
followed by white metals and chemicals
(tin and antimony alloys and chemi-
cals); next in importance comes pro-
cessed lead products, followed by
ferrous scrap merchandising. In the
breakdown of the business between mer-
chandising and manufacturing, income
derived from 'manufacturing is mar-
ginally larger than from merchandising.
In red metals, Lempriere produces
foundry copper and aluminium alloys
in brass and gunmetal, along with
centrifugally and static cast bronze
bushings for the engineering trades, and
master alloys for foundry work includ-
ing phosphor copper and 'manganese
copper. In white metals, the company
dominates the market in printing
metals, supplying and servicing all
major newspapers and other large print-
ing shops in Australia.
Lempriere is also the No. 1 producer
of solders in Australia, including body-
fill solders to the motor industry; resin-
core solders for the electronics industry;
solders for automatic can-making
machines; solder powders, tin powders,
and soldering and tinning fluxes. An-
other product is bearing metals used
by the marine, automotive, and heavy
engineering industries.
The company is the No. 2 Australian
producer of tin and antimony chemi-
cals, including sodium stannate and
stannous chloride used in electroplat-
ing; antimony oxide and tin oxide
used as opacifiers in the ceramics in-
dustry (in ceramic tiles; glass is ren-
dered opaque by tin oxide); and tin
oxide used in the preparation of
ceramic stains and colors.
Lempriere is reputed to have one of
the most modern laboratories in the
metallurgical field in Australia, and it
was the first to use spectrographic
analytical techniques in commercial
production work this was in 1942.
Included among the present installa-
tions is a Philips X-ray fluorescence
spectrometer, which is now being used
in the analysis of tin ores and furnace
products. The Alexandria laboratory is
also shortly to be equipped with a
multi-channel direct-reading spectro-
graph and atomic absorption apparatus.
The technical staff numbers 18, with 13
graduates and trainees in metallurgy in
the laboratory.

The drop in earnings from the high
of 1965 followed a violent swing in tin
prices; tin prices in Australia as com-
piled by the Bureau of Mineral Re-
sources showed a rise from an average
of $2194 per long ton in 1964 to
$3629 in 1965, and then fell to $3058
in 1966. In 1967 tin prices in Australia
were stable at $3OBB per ton. The
issuing of 20 percent of the capital to
Capper Pass and Son Ltd., Yorkshire,
in 1965 gives Lempriere access to one
of the world’s leaders in the field of
smelting and refining of complex ores
and secondary materials. Since Capper
Pass was acquired by Rio Tinto Zinc
Corporation in 1967, the indirect link
with RTZ gives Lempriere’s shares a
new speculative interest, at a time
when RTZ’s Australian publicly listed
subsidiaries CRA and Hamersley have
captured enormous market attention.
Summary: At $0.95, the shares com-
mand a dividend yield of 5.3 percent
and the price earnings ratio is 12.4. On
balance, the shares seem reasonably
priced at this level.

Behind the balance sheets
The building boom gives a
boost to John Mcllwraith
THE BUILDING business is worth a
close look. May building approvals,
both number of new dwellings and
value of new dwellings and of other
new buildings, were at unprecedentedly
high levels for Australia as a whole.
Few companies are better able to take
advantage of this buoyancy than the
manufacturer and supplier of builders’
and plumbers’ requisites, John
Mcllwraith Industries Ltd.
So it should. The company has been
a very dull performer indeed for the
two years to June last year, as it seems
to have concentrated more on expansion
than earning profits. In 1965-66, profit
dropped 18 percent; in 1966-67 the
company was affected by static condi-
tions in N.S.W. (partly attributable to
drought) and depressed conditions in
South Australia (which had nothing
going for it industrially), so the group’s
profit slipped fractionally from the
already depressed level of 1966.
But in the first half of the current
year profit rose 8.84 percent, although
sales were only up 1.43 percent. It is
believed that sales in the second half
made better progress and so should the
profit. If at a conservative estimate a
nine percent profit gain is made for the
year, earning rate should improve to
22 percent, on a par with the 1963
result, when the shares commanded a
much bigger premium.
Some steady selling from one source
(which appears to have ended some
months ago) pushed the shares down
to an unjustifiably pessimistic level to
95c, from which they .have now crept to
$1.20 (they have been 7c higher this
year), showing a yield of 6.3 percent.
This is very high for a stock of this
quality; the company itself considers a
4 percent yield is more appropriate.
But even a 5 percent yield would
mean a 25 percent price appreciation.
(In the past the company has employed
its share premium to good effect, mak-
ing inexpensive takeovers, and prob-
ably hopes to do so in future.)
The state of the building industry in
recent years has pretty well put a
damper on Mcllwraith’s profit-earning
capacity, and the past two years have
been a come-down from 1965’s record
result.
But the way approvals are shaping
up, commencements and completions
for the next few months (in the case
of houses) and in a couple of years for
apartment and industrial and com-
mercial buildings are going to provide
a very healthy market indeed for
Mcllwraith’s cast-iron and pressed-
steel porcelain enamelled baths and
basins, cisterns, taps, bathroom fittings,
pipes, sewerage fittings, and so on.
Mcllwraith’s fortunes are most
closely allied to housing and flat con-
struction, but a Sydney subsidiary is
developing a market for fabricated
plumbing for big commercial and resi-
dential buildings like the Australia
Square project and Park Regis (com-
pleted) and the 27-storey AMP build-
ing in Melbourne, now under construc-
tion.
The only weak spots in the Austra-
lian building industry now seem to
be in South Australia, Queensland, and
the A.C.T. Certainly the major markets
of N.S.W. and Victoria are very much
more active, and Western Australia is
positively booming.
John Mcllwraith Industries is now
rounding off two years of considerable
capital expenditure. In Sydney it has
built two new factories at Milperra
to occupy two of the five blocks, per-
haps occupying effectively one-third of
the total 23 acres, which leaves plenty
of room for expansion. There was a
$500,000 investment in the new brass
smelting and extrusion works build-
ings and plant, and a $250,000 invest-
ment in the sheet-metal plant. These
moves were either amalgamating or ex-
panding existing operations in Sydney.
In Melbourne, where the group’s
largest manufacturing centre is located
at Coburg, the company has spent
$500,000 on revamping the Moorabbin
pressed-metal plant, and at Coburg
the sheet-metal plant has been ex-
panded, new production methods intro-
duced, and others streamlined. The
company continually endeavors to im-
prove its products and develop new
ones. Two bath patterns have won
good design awards.
The company also has plants, at
Waterloo in Sydney, and in Adelaide
and/Perth, and the Queensland manu-
facturing activities have been concen-
trated this last year at Bulimba, in a
new location, where total investment
was well in excess of $600,000. The
plant was opened on April 4, 1968.
Most of this capital expenditure of
the past two years has been on build-
ings rather than plant, so that no great
alleviation of the tax burden can be
expected for 1967-68. In Newcastle
the company is spending $lOO,OOO on
a new depot, where previously the
company had rented premises.
Higher wage costs will present some
problems in 1968-69. Perhaps 75 to 80
percent of employees work under Metal
Trades awards, and recent increases
have been fully implemented to add
something like 12 to 15 percent to
the wages bill, about $200,000 extra in
a full year. The company prides itself
on its excellent industrial relations,
with never a major strike. The com-
pany has been investing in new plant
and buildings to obtain greater pro-
ductivity and the increasing demand
for its products has allowed it to
absorb these increased costs.
Raw material costs vary according
to copper prices, which have been up
and down, with an unsettling effect
on the industry. The vagaries of
world copper prices puts a strain on
company liquidity, for Mcllwraith has
to hold big stocks. At present the local
price is on a par with the overseas
price, and the general impression is
that it will settle down in the next
six months. The price instability
inhibits buoyancy in the non-ferrous
metal market.
The variability of copper prices, of
course, makes planning doubly difficult
in that it affects the economics of
plumbing. The use of cast-iron and
plastic piping and plumbing generally
means the co’mpany balances its plumb-
ing business on a knife edge.
Metal prices have an influence on
the level of stock holdings; for instance,
stocks rose by 7.3 percent in 1966-67
when sales rose only 2.23 percent
(although the new stores also required
greater stockholdings) and debtors rose
by 6.4 percent.
The indecision of entrants to the
fertiliser industry and the possibility
of substitute materials have brought
uncertainty to Mcllwraith’s lead-sheet
and lead-pipe business, but the PMG
provides a steady market.
The expansion which Mcllwraith has
now virtually completed, ushering in an
era of consolidation which should be
reflected in a profit revival, has been
financed without recourse to share-
holders since the one-for-five issue at
50c premium in December, 1964. The
company has not felt very flush, but a
long-term loan for $1.5 'milllion was
obtained in 1967-68 to eliminate the
$1.2 million increase in unsecured loans
shown in 1967 accounts at a total of
$3.2 million.
The 15 percent dividend has been
paid since 1958. A share issue (with a
bonus element) would be sufficient re-
ward for medium-term investors,
although the bonus (one-for-four) of
1959-60 may be repeated at sotne future
period of greater boom.
The 50c shares look very sound buy-
ing for the income-conscious investor
who is not averse to the swings of a
cyclical industry. John Mcllwraith
Industries right now must be poised for
the upswing.

Mining
Oil and gas but no market yet
WITH THE IMMINENT spudding of
the Tyler well in the northern sector of
the Amadeus Basin, interest is again.'
being focused upon an area of Australia
which has proved to date to be some-
what of an enigma in the search for oil.
Despite the success achieved from
drilling the Mereenie structure, which
has resulted in the delineation of sub-
stantial quantities of oil and gas in
place, recoverable reserves of oil are
presently insufficient to make its com-
mercial exploitation a viable proposi-
tion. With proven “in place” reserves
of 1.2 trillion cubic feet of gas and 500
million barrels of oil, the structure is a
major one by world standards. During
testing of the various holes drilled on
the Mereenie anticline, gas flows of up
to 60.5 million cubic feet per day were
recorded; oil flowed at the rate of 350
barrels per day from East Mereenie
No. 4 after fracturing of the two major
oil sand intervals had been undertaken
to stimulate the flow and also to coun-
teract the damage to these sands caused
during mud-drilling operations.
The second of the Amadeus Basin
structures which has produced com-
mercial quantities of hydrocarbons, the
Palm Valley structure, is a very large
field, with an area in excess of 100
square miles and having substantial
reserves of natural gas. As with the
Mereenie anticline, the thickness of
gas sands in this structure is to the
order of 1000 feet, but unlike Mereenie
the gas is not underlain by oil sands,
although it is a wet gas. On test, the
well flowed at rates up to 11.7 million
cubic feet per day with minor quanti-
ties of condensates.
Although these two structures have
sufficient recoverable gas reserves to
supply the requirements of the Sydney
'market for 20 years, the remoteness of
the Amadeus Basin from the largest
existing gas-consuming markets renders
the exploitation of the discoveries un-
economical.
Whilst the “in place” reserves of
Mereenie are estimated to be 500
million barrels, no estimate has been
published of the recoverable reserves
despite the exhaustive drilling and test-
ing which has been undertaken. How-
ever, it is apparent that they alone are
insufficient to justify the construction
of a pipeline either to tidewater or the
nearest refinery gate.
In an endeavor to utilise these vast
resources, the partners in the two areas,
i.e., Mereenie and Palm Valley, com-
missioned Pipe Line Technologists Pty.
Ltd. to conduct a detailed feasibility
study of the market in central and
northern Australia for petroleum pro-
ducts, both gaseous and liquid. This
study, whilst concerned with the long-
term outlook for the consumption of
hydrocarbon fuels, will initially be dir-
ected toward the exploitation of the
gas from the Palm Valley field and the
oil from Mereenie. The present de-
'mands for oil products in the Alice
Springs-Tennant Creek region is con-
fined to motor-vehicle usage and elec-
tricity generation and is comparatively
small. However, the outlook is an en-
couraging one as the discovery and
development of new mineral resources
in the region will require significant
increases in energy supplies and the
Amadeus Basin fields could well become
the source of these energy supplies.
Two of the three holes to be drilled
in the 1968 exploration program for
the areas are structures delineated dur-
ing the Missionary Plains seismic sur-
vey which was completed at the end
of 1966. This survey, the largest indi-
vidual land seismic survey undertaken
in Australia up to that time, took 20
months to complete, and cost some $l.l
million. Seven major prospects were
defined and thirty other leads obtained
in the northern section of the basin,
which, as a result of previous drilling,
now appears to have the most favorable
geological conditions for the accumula-
tion of hydrocarbons.
First of the holes is Tyler No. 1, be-
ing drilled on the crest of a structure
some 13 square miles in area and
having approximately 600 feet of clos-
ure. This hole has a programmed depth
of 12,600 feet and is designed to test
the Mereenie Stairway and Pacoota
sandstone series where all have con-
siderable cover, a situation which does
not exist in the southern portion of
the Basin.
Should this hole bring in only gas,
then the partners will not have achieved
the breakthrough they are hoping for.
The discovery of a considerable volume
of gas will, however, enhance the pros-
pects of the sale of liquefied natural gas
to Japan in the event that agreement
cannot be reached for its sale in Aus-
tralia. From the proposed bauxite port
of Gove to Japan is approximately the
same distances as Alaska is from Japan,
and the Japanese have concluded con-
tracts for the import of very consider-
able quantities of liquefied natural gas
from Alaska.
Since 1960 the tenement holders of
this sector of the Amadeus Basin have
been overseas-controlled companies fol-
lowing the relinquishing of the areas
by the Frome-Broken Hill Company
Pty. Ltd., which had conducted geologi-
cal and geophysical surveys of the
Basin during 1958-59. With the for-
mation in 1964 of Magellan Petroleum
Australia Ltd., the Australian public
regained an equity in the area, which
has progressively increased with local
companies obtaining farm-in agree-
ments and a greater percentage of the

capital of Magellan Petroleum Aus-
tralia Ltd. -coming into local hands.
Following the flotation earlier -this
year of Southern Pacific Petroleum
N.L., the Australian equity in certain
of the prospects delineated in the
Missionary Plains will he increased still
further upon completion of work
requirements by Southern Pacific
Petroleum. In the current hole, Tyler,
Southern Pacific Petroleum can earn
a 10 percent interest by paying 20 per-
cent of the cost, whilst Farmout
Drillers N.L. maintain its 8 l-3rd per-
cent working interest in the entire
Missionary Plains area.
The major partner -in the Mereenie
wells and in the earlier farm-ins in the
Amadeus Basin, Exoil N.L., is not a
participant in any of the three holes
planned for drilling this year, nor did
it participate in the Missionary Plains
seismic survey.
Covering as it does some 60,000
square miles, the basin still has a large
area relatively unexplored, so that the
prospects of it yet producing com-
mercial quantities of liquid hydro-
carbons cannot be summarily dismissed
as has tended to be the case since the
prolific offshore discoveries in the
Gippsland Basin and the present con-
centration of exploration effort in
other offshore areas.
UNTIL A COUPLE of weeks ago not
much had been heard of the mighty
Placer Development Ltd. group in the
Australian minerals boom. The bulk of
Placer’s local activities was in manu-
facturing rather than mining following
the sale of its coal interests. Its Fox
Manufacturing and Plywood Manufac-
turing subsidiaries and its Molybond
Laboratories associate company were
doing fairly well, with Fox’s Hi-Flow
fans, mining equipment, and conveyer
belts putting in pretty good results,
largely because of the mining boom.
Its own mining operations here have
been limited to prospecting for various
minerals all around Australia, and last
year it reported that initial work in
New Guinea and Queensland yielded
encouraging copper anomalies and
that a favorably situated area with
anomalous nickel had been optioned in
Western Australia. Leases in north-west
Australia held by its half-owned asso-
ciate, Ausminda, had shown “extensive
submarginal oxide copper mineralisa-
tions” and further testing of primary
lead-zinc-copper potential was planned
at the time df the last annual report.
But its prospecting is now going to
increase, following the acquisition by
Kaiser Aluminium of a half interest in
Placer’s exploration subsidiary, whose
capital is now to double. This will pro-
duce a formidable team, particularly in
view of Kaiser’s interests in ferro-nickel
in New Caledonia and its major role
in Hamersley Iron in Australia (apart
from its bauxite-alumina ties with
CRA). Although its North American
operations dominate the company’s
profitability and prospects, Placer could
now become a significant force in the
Australian minerals scene.

THE LAND
Wool in the container age
TO ACCUSE the Australian Wool
Board of having so far done “next to
nothing” to prepare its industry for
containerisation, as the Senate Select
Committee does in its recently pub-
lished report, see’ms to be an unneces-
sary and unwarranted piece of
rubbishing. Perhaps Farmer Cormack
was being deliberately forgetful of the
role of the Wool Board, just for the
purpose of giving a push to everybody
involved in preparations at the Aus-
tralian end of containerisation of the
U.K./Continent cargo trades. Its role
is a sort of agency in which it rep-
resents both growers and Government
in, say, the spending of the consider-
able funds put up by them for promot-
ing the product and doing other useful
things for the industry.
While supporting the Senate Select
Co'mmittee’s recommendations concern-
ing wool’s involvement in container-
isation, Mr. R. S. Henderson (repre-
senting buyers of about 97 pecent of
the Australian wool clip) said it would
be a disaster for the industry if buyers
were to be dictated to on how their
wool is to be shipped. Further, in
supporting the Committee’s proposal
for high-density dumping, in the pre-
paration of wool for shipment by
container or unit load means, he
warned that wool'buyers would resist
any attempt to make the process of
dumping anybody’s "monopoly. As he
put it, the essence of the matter,
whether concerning shipping methods
or dumping, was that buyers should
retain their freedom.
If the Board has appeared to be
doing “next to nothing” on container-
isation it is perhaps because for a long
time its chairman has been stone silent
on the matter, at least in public. The
truth is, however, that the Board has
been hard at work behind the scenes,
using the gentle art of persuasion to
get the various sections of the industry
(mainly brokers, buyers, and overseas
customers) into one line to take the
necessary decisions well in advance of
the advent of containerisation. The
Board’s plan of campaign was put
before the Wool Industry Conference
last October, but its officers were busy
preparing the industry long before that.
The plan is all set down, complete with
blueprints of wool villages, including
the set-up most probably to be adopted,
at any rate in Sydney.
It is in volume 1, part 2 of its very
lucid report on wool marketing sub-
mitted to the Wool Industry Con-
ference. Presumably Senator Cormack
has seen this report and the Committee
should have informed itself of subse-
quent progress toward implementing
the plan under the guiding hand of the
Wool Board. If it has, apparently it
hasn’t been impressed, despite the many
useful steps that have been taken.
On the technical side, for ins ance,
experiments conducted by the Wool
Board in conjunction with local wool-
buyers (Mr. Colin Stagg, of Melbourne,
in particular) and U.K. mills have
convinced the latter that wool is not
adversely affected by high-density
dumping, and is even advantaged by
it in some respects. Similar trial runs
are soon to be made by the Wool
Board to convince the 20 European
mills which cover all our customers
in the Common Market of the effective-
ness of high-density dumping.
Other steps to be taken include the
ordering of high-density dumping
equipment of the type invented in
Melbourne and already in operation at
Dalgetys there. It has also been decided
that wool will be dumped to a density
to make up five-bale lots equally suited
for unit load and container shipment
(105 of these lots will go into a
standard-size container). The Wool
Board has sponsored a feasibility study
of how best to implement container-
isation for wool. This is being done
with the co-operation of the Wool
Selling Brokers organisation (which
would have the biggest stake in the
planned villages and their location and
establishment) and others in the
industry.
Considerable progress has been made,
not only with this study but also in
moving toward firm decisions on sites
and such things as the disposal of exist-
ing wool stores, most of which are
expected to become redundant when
wool villages are established.
The first is likely to be at Yennora,
in N.S.W., although there are no signs
anywhere of bricks and mortar being
put into position. If this is what has
pierced Senator Cormack’s skin, he
can hardly put it down to any lack of
enthusiasm on the part of the officers
of the Wool Board. Their tangible role
in erecting wool communes is no more
than as a catalyst to bring the various
and sometimes perverse parties in-
volved to the building point.
Agrisearch
Horticulturists' food for thought
AN AUSTRALIAN Fruit Research
Conference was held at Mildura last
week. This was the third in a quin-
quennial series of get-togethers that are
attended by a certain species of horti-
cultural specialists. They discuss, almost
exclusively, fundamental aspects of tree
growth and the formation of flowers
and fruits. Little, if anything, is re-
marked upon that would be of imme-
diate interest to orchardists.
Nevertheless, this kind of seemingly
obtuse study occasionally uncovers
something of possibly sensational signifi-
cance. For example, folklore hath it that
mushroom-eaters do not develop can-
cerous growths. Now the expatriate
Hungarian and Nobel prizewinner
Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, presently work-
ing at the Marine Biology Laboratory,
Woods Hole, Massachusetts, has pro-
duced scientific evidence supporting this
belief. He has found that two sub-
stances control the multiplication of
cells. He has named these chemicals
promine and retine. The first promotes
cell growth and the second retards it.
In healthy, mature tissue retine pre-
dominates over promine. However, in
cancerous tissue the reverse situation
prevails. He has found further that the
commercially cultivated mushroom,
Agaricus bisporus, is particularly rich
in retine with only a trace of promine
in its fruiting body—the edible part. He
has also shown that clams match mush-
rooms in this regard and points out that
no case of cancer has ever been seen in
these creatures.
Retine or mushrooms, therefore,
could provide the answer to one of the
fondest dreams of modern science: a
cheap and readily available chemical to
combat cancer. Its chemical co'mposition
has already been calculated and
methods of manufacture or extraction
on a large scale are being studied, while
biological tests of its effectiveness
against cancer in the higher animals
are continuing. One fact has been estab-
lished at this stage —retine is extremely
non-toxic to humans.
New South Wales is overwhelmingly
the largest producer of this mushroo'm

in Australia. About 90 percent of the
national harvest is gathered in that
State, most of it within 50 miles of
Sydney. However, mushroom culture is
beginning to catch on in other States,
and people prepared to acquire the
necessary skills and devote themselves
to the job can make a tidy income from
raising 'mushrooms. The market is ex-
panding and the supply is falling fur-
ther behind the demand.
Miss Y. Fripp, of the same depart-
ment, has good news for commercial
and backyard growers of peaches and
similar stone fruits subject to brown
rot, Sclerotinia fructicola. Thiabenda-
zole, a drug widely used as a drench
by graziers to control internal para-
sites in sheep and cattle, may also be
used as a dip to delay the development
of brown rot on soft fruits. This fol-
lows the finding about a year ago that
thiabendazole was the only economic
and effective means available for stop-
ping stem-end rot in bananas. A dip
containing 1200 parts per million of
thiabendazole gave up to 100 percent
control in Miss Fripp’s experiments, but
a concentration only a quarter as strong
afforded considerable protection. Un-
necessarily strong concentrations did
not damage the fruit. But the depart-
ment cautions that the health authori-
ties have not yet approved this use of
* thiabendazole. Everyone owning a
peach tree will hope that official
sanction comes before next harvest.
The importance of fruit in the
human diet was highlighted recently
and from an unexpected quarter. The
U.S. Department of Agriculture has
just completed its latest decennial sur-
vey of the standard of nutrition in
American homes. Half provided “good”
diets and one-fifth served “poor” diets.
Compared with the previous survey
when 60 percent of the households had
a good diet and only 15 percent a poor
diet, the latest survey discloses a de-
clining “standard. The reason attributed
for this is that more Americans are
making a bad choice in their food pur-
chases and are not spending their extra
dollars to buy the best nutrition pos-
sible.
Chief nutrients lacking were vitamins
A and C, particularly in the southern
homes, and calcium, more noticeably
in the northern households. In effect,
American homemakers should make up
menus to include more fruit and milk.
This conclusion receives indirect sup-
port from marketing statistics: the
volume of milk now being sold in the
States is down ten percent and fruit
seven percent on a per capita basis. A
possible explanation for the decline
could also be that more Americans are
ncxw buying more meals outside the
home. This puts a greater respon-
sibility on the housewife to plan the
week’s meals so that they are strong
on the items neglected by the cafe-
terias.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
The Trust: not only survival,
also another day
By DENIS O'BRIEN
THE Elizabethan Theatre Trust has
carelessly survived so much objective
criticism in the past few years that it
seems only subjective anger is left to
those thoroughly disillusioned by its in-
adequacies and irritated by its calm
assumption of an effective maximum
effort.
The time for anger is at hand: the
Trust has just delivered its 1967 annual
report —another document of gaps and
self-congratulatory generalities—and its
new chairman, Sir lan Potter, has had
a few alarmingly enlightening things to
say about its future.
I suppose that it was wishful think-
ing to imagine that the establishment
of the Australian Council for the Arts
would relegate the Trust, with its
board of “public-spirited citizens” and
its record of uninspiring activity to a
purely subordinate position. The
thought wasn’t without reason; after
all, if the Trust had done its job
properly in the past 14 years, the Coun-
cil for the Arts should not have been
necessary.
Yet far from being shamed into a
harmless corner by its displacement, the
Trust seems presumptuously ready to
off-load most of its financial prob-
lems and responsibilities on to the ACA
and to march off anew as an entre-
preneur, a role in w'hich it has never
had very much distinguished success.
In his statements to the Press last
week. Sir lan Potter left no doubt that
the Trust automatically considers itself
as the Council’s right arm. As several
of his forecasts and assumptions W'ere
made before the Council had even held
its inaugural meeting, we can only
believe that he is in possession of privi-
leged information and that the Council
already is of a mind to perpetuate
Australia’s suffocating number of cul-
tural boards, trusts, advisory councils,
and committees.
For instance, he says that the Trust’s
long-term role would be limited to ad-
ministration and the staging of produc-
tions of ballet, opera, and drama.
Surely, the opera and ballet companies,
which already have their own clusters
of committees, are ready to operate
autonomously; surely they don’t need
the Trust and the Council, and then-
own little subsidiary organisations to
give them momentum. And the Trust
has not done —and certainly isn’t doing
—anything primary in the production
of drama to demonstrate that it will be
any more dynamic in the legitimate
theatre simply because it now' has a new
treasurer.
Sir lan’s suggestion that the Trust
would “control production in theatre
properties such as the Melbourne Cul-
tural Centre and the Sydney Opera
House” is too dismaying to be true. The
thought of the Trust and its board of
30 part-time dilettantes supervising any-
thing more than a w'ardrobe-and-
property shop now seems laughable,
wasteful, and quite unnecessary. I just
cannot see that the Trust has any
other more useful function than to hand
over what skilled personnel it has to
autonomous companies and retire.
Just how presumptuous the Trust is
about its future role can be gauged by
Sir lan’s suggestion that, as a long-range
policy, the Trust would “wean-off” to
the ACA the financial responsibility for
opera, ballet, and drama. He thought
Sir lan ... all’s well
this process would take between three
and five years. Members of the Council
for the Arts doubtless will be surprised
to find that their policy already is being
influenced by their predecessors.
Sir Ian marked the delivery of his
first annual report since succeeding Dr.
H. C. Coombs as chairman by holding
a Press conference before the annual
general meeting of Trust members. The
occasion was well-intentioned, but the
question-and-answer-session was not
allowed to disturb the cosy state of all’s
well which the Trust has always so
assiduously tried to maintain.
When I pointed out that the Trust’s
subsidies to drama appeared to be
down by more than S3OCO this year, I
was peremptorily referred to a column
of figures on another page which
indicated that in subsidies and grants
the Trust had, in fact, given $396,631
to drama $22,706 more than last
year. But the appropriations for drama
listed in the report do not add up to
anything like $396,000, and as the
Trust so meticulously details its activi-
ties for the year, even to the point of
repetition, I can only wonder where
the money was spent.
The most bewildering contradiction
in the report was the announcement of
a financial surplus for the year of
$64,135 (from a deficit of $33,582 last
year) despite falls in total income,
box-office receipts, and total attend-
ances. and the writing-off of $18,869 in
bad debts.
My ultimate subjective assessment of
the Trust is, as has been said by others
before, that it has become a bore
an uninspiring, ponderous bore. For too
many years it has been tapping its
magic box without showing us a really
clever trick. It has existed on the suf-
ferance of a largely uninterested pub-
lic and hasn’t ever lived up to the
vision Dr. Coombs had for it in 1954
when he talked of making theatre in
Australia “the same vigorous and sig-
nificant factor in national life as it
was in England during the reign of
Elizabeth the First.”
It has built up a portfolio of com-
pany shares and debentures with a
1967 market value of $190,272 and
which Sir lan Potter refers to as a “ne-t
egg” (for what purpose, God only
knows), but it has failed to give Aus-
tralia a significant dramatic theatre.
Mr. Stefan Haag’s 1967 report as
executive director is a clear indication
of how run-down and uninspiring the
Trust has become. In what is super-
ficially a chronicle of busy effort, five
of the 10 paragraphs relate to support
for cultural activities w'hich arose out-
side the Trust.
For example: “Drama in Sydney also
enjoyed financial benefits through the
New South Wales Government’s newly
created Cultural Grants Advisory Com-
mittee and through the Gulbenkian
Foundation, which made a grant to the
University of New South Wales Drama
Foundation for a season of Australian
plays.” And: “The Australian Ballet
and the Australian Ballet School have
now occupied the newdy renovated
premises so generously provided by the
Melbourne City Council at Debney’s
Paddock, Flemington Bridge.”
If the generosity of the Melbourne
City Council could run to another pad-
dock, it is there that the Australian
Elizabethan Theatre Trust should
safely graze.


LEARNING LIFE
FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Graduate. Director, Mike Nichols.
IN SPITE OF the emphasis on youth
in mass media and in general conver-
sation, that appalling state of ado-
lescence physical or mental seems
to be as agonising as ever. Its curious
miseries have rarely been put on film
so well: with the exception of “The
Member of the Wedding,” I can’t re-
member a movie that records with such
accuracy and sympathy the twinges of
growing pains.
“The Graduate,” of course, deals
with a young man instead of a girl,
and he’s at a later stage of life, but
no better equipped to deal with it.
Benjamin has just graduated quite
brilliantly from college, having learnt
everything except how to live and how r
to adjust to society. His parents are
Dustin Hoffman ... growing pains
little help. While he wants to discuss
his future, they overwhelm him with
welcome-home parties and expensive
gifts. His sexual education is briskly
taken over by the randy wife of his
father’s business partner; but Benjamin
complicates matters by falling in love
with her daughter. ,
It’s a beauniully scripted film, with
a sharp and sometimes slightly spite-
ful ear for the more fatuous cliches of
the modern affluent society. The direc-
tor has a splendid cast to work with
and handles them brilliantly; his use
of the camera occasionally gets rather
too fancy, but is often inventive and
funny. Between them, director Mike
Nichols and actor Dustin Hoffman
make Benjamin a fully rounded charac-
ter —gauche, maddening, but always
sympathetic and likable. This is an only
too accurate portrait of youthful em-
barrassment and alarm. Only at the
end does Benjamin smile, and then
briefly and tentatively, as if being
happy were a new skill in which he
wasn’t yet expert.
The movie does sag a little in the
middle, though not to any disastrous
extent, and pulls itself together for a
fast and funny finale. The happy end-
ing seemed to me glib and unconvinc-
ing, but by the time it came about I
was so on-side with Benjamin that I
really couldn’t be too offended by it.
Communicating
SOFT-SELLING WOOL
THE AUSTRALIAN Wool Board is
already planning its campaign for next
year, so we can expect more of those
arresting television commercials putting
drama into wool.
So far, the people at the Board’s
agency, Jackson Wain, aren’t saying
what they have in mind for wool’s 1969
image, but if it resembles the 1968
version we can prepare for the soft
sell with built-in entertainment value.
This year Jackson Wain made a set of
four commercials featuring shots of
good-looking men, women, Wool
Award garments, and afghan hounds
edited in staccato style to give
immediacy and a vaguely intriguing
sense of menace.
The commercials were planned to
coincide with the rest of the Wool
Board’s merchandising campaign, which
meant that the commercials showed
only garments available from retailers
whose names were flashed on screen
at the end of each commercial. As
things worked out, the commercials
contained a total of about 70 garments,
each of which averaged about three
seconds of screen time perhaps the
ultimate in subliminal advertising.
As they say in the trade, the films
were shot “loosely” and to hear the
account’s creative director, Leo Scho-
field, it all sounds very casual indeed.
“We had an idea of the kind of thing
we wanted, and we devised various
locations in which we thought the gar-
ments looked best. But we made a point
of being flexible about it. For instance,
if we were driving somewhere and saw
a location we liked, we stopped and
took some shots. We carried the gar-
ments round with us all the time in a
special van, but the main drawback was
that we were filming in the middle of
January so we couldn’t do many
close-ups because the perspiration was
streaming down the models’ faces.”
OUT OF TUNE
THE ABC’s concert department, which
customarily functions with untroubled
success, got a sharp jolt to its public-
relations arm in Melbourne last week.
Fewer than 200 people were scattered
throughout the vast reaches of the Mel-
bourne Town Hall for what was adver-
tised as a “special orchestral concert”
featuring soprano Phyllis Curtin and
the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.
Music critics weren’t surprised at the
poor turn-out. The “orchestral” concert
consisted solely of accompaniments plus
three short popular “fillers” and wasn’t
likely to attract an orchestral audience.
And a singer who is completely un-
known in this country, no matter how
good, is not likely to fill even a small
hall, let alone a draughty echo chamber
like the Town Hall on a cold winter’s
night at $6.50 a seat.
NEWS AND RUMORS
AS WELL as making news with the
sale (for $3.2 million) of its Collins
Street and Flinders Lane building last
week, the Melbourne “Age” has been
the subject of several lively rumors.
The first, that it intended soon to begin
publication of a Melbourne Sunday
newspaper, was laughed off by “Age”
managing director Ranald Macdonald
as “speculation by our competitors.”
The second, that it is planning a student
newspaper, is closer to immediate
truth.
According to Mr. Macdonald, the
“Age” is discussing the student-
newspaper proposal but hasn’t yet done
much more than examine costs. Its
form and circulation area — national
or merely Melbourne local — haven’t
yet been seriously considered. But an
editor is waiting in the wings — Peter
Steedman, a volatile former editor of
a couple of undergraduate papers in
Melbourne.

CELEBRATING WITH CLASSICS
POLITICIANS may still be dithering
about how we should celebrate our
bi-centennial, but Sydney publisher
Peter Pring already has launched his
endeavor. “To celebrate the 200th
anniversary of Captain Cook’s Dis-
covery,” says the publicity material,
“eight books of Australian classics are
yours for $23.95.” The books are “Rob-
bery Under Arms,” Lawson’s best
stories, “The Getting of Wisdom,” “For
the Term of His Natural Life,” “The
Fortunes of Richard Mahony,” bush
songs, ballads, and other verse, “Ralph
Rashleigh,” and “Such Is Life.”
The books are available only by mail
order. Pring and his partner, English-
man Timothy Evers, had the books
printed in Japan. They are a hand-
some job and Pring claims that
nowhere in those seemingly endless
pages of “Such Is Life,” nor in fact
in any of the books, is there a mis-
print.
Pring, a former journalist, got the
idea when he was in London and people
talked to him about Australian books
he had not read and which were often
out of print. He gave up a job W'ith
Collins to begin this project. He got
the rights of the Henry Handel
Richardson books from Heinemann’s.
Dr. Colin Roderick holds the copy-
right for his editing of “Ralph Rash-
leigh.” The Lawson copyright, held
by Angus and Robertson, expires in
1970, and Pring expects a flood of re-
prints then. The other books were
out of copyright.


SPANNING THE
FRIGID GAP
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
America Hurrah. Jean-Claude van
Itallie, New Theatre, Sydney.
“THEATRE ACCEPTS the idea of
art for art’s sake, with life on one side
and art on the other. We can rest on
this feeble and lazy idea only as long
as the life outside endures. But there
are too many signs that everything
that used to sustain our lives no longer
does so, that we are all mad, des-
perate, and sick. And I call for us (the
theatre) to react.” So Antonin Artaud
wrote 30 years ago. Now that Ken-
nedy-King-Kennedy is current reality
we are all beginning to react. How to
express the reaction, and what place
that expression has in the “real life”
of its audience, are problems that are
giving back to theatre a sense of pur-
pose and vitality. In “America Hurrah”
van Itallie does his best to tell the
“Motel” . .. apocalypse of violence
truth, to leave a scar, and to span the
frigid gap between art and life; as
Artaud’s “us” implies, the theatre is
the most likely place for such an
attempt to succeed. Director John Tas-
ker and the New Theatre are to be
thanked for staging a play that lets us
take theatre seriously for once.
The three plays in “America Hurrah”
lead us step by step from an analytic
look at the crushed component parts
of the social organisation (“Inter-
view”), through a remarkable realisa-
tion of the way a mass medium controls
and conditions the society it was
designed to serve (“TV”), to an apoc-
alypse of violence (“Motel”), which
both represents the tendencies and pre-
dicts the outcome of the society
described in the first two plays. To
realise this vision eight actors assume a
large range of characters in situations
and dialogue that are fragmented and
formalised (“Interview”), halfway
between reality and fantasy (“TV”),
and nightmare-symbolic (“Motel”).
Just as Artaud wrote about the special
“athletic” training of actors for the
theatre he proposed, so plays like
“America Hurrah” and the “Marat-
Sade” require actors with special train-
ing and experience.
In this production John Tasker has
used two groups of eight actors, each
group playing “Interview” one night
and “TV” the next, thus spreading the
parts over a larger number without
diminishing the involvement of each
actor. “Interview” makes great de-
mands on ensemble strength, and I
felt that the rehearsal period had
probably not been enough to develop
it fully in the group. Unfortunately,
there’s something wrong with “TV.”
Van Itallie says “the attention of the
audience should not be focused on a
parody of television, but on the rela-
tionship of the life that appears on
television to the life that goes on in
the viewing-room.” Perhaps some other
method of staging than that suggested
by the script needs to be devised. “TV”
is potentially a far more effective play
than this production makes it.
Set and props, masks and make-up
are all remarkably successful in the first
two plays, and the small stage is used
with great effect. In “Motel” the limi-
tations of the theatre are something
of a disadvantage. But I suppose that
no matter how detailed the set, how
total the destruction, one would always
feel that something had been held
back. However, the shock is there. Con-
fronted by this vision of the society
on which ours is patterned (there is no
comfortable sense of distance for an
Australian audience: it is all as im-
mediately true for Sydney as it is for
New York), it is impossible to come
away without some recognition of the
frightening and destructive impulses at
work both inside and around us.
Or is it? Does “America Hurrah”
leave a scar? Van Itallie says “. . . the
theatre artist ... is allowed his say,
even applauded, and that which was
meant to bite is accepted with a sen-
sual ouch of titillation. And this is
because the artist is unimportant.” Cer-
tainly the role of theatre in society is
changing whether in a cycle of decay
or regeneration is not clear. If the
tendencies of Artaud and the new
approach to theatre which owes so
much to him are confirmed theatre
could regain a position in society
which it has not held since the days of
Aeschylus. In the meantime it is per-
haps enough if “America Hurrah” can
make us think twice about turning on
the TV.
STRINDBERG MASTERED
THEATRE/ROBERT WARD
The Father. August Strindberg, Scott
Theatre, Adelaide.
THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN Theatre
Company’s 1968 season has opened
with an uncompromising, brooding, and
totally effective production by Colin
Ballantyne of Strindberg’s “The
Father.” It indicates once again Bal-
lantyne’s considerable, mastery of 19th-
century European drama and, to a
lesser extent, comedy.
With “The Father” he has a strong
cast led by Les Day’man and Beverly
Dunn. Dayman’s Captain, the father,
is a sensitive and intelligent interpreta-
tion of a neurotic, yet essentially gentle,
man. In contrast, Miss Dunn’s Laura,
the captain’s wife, is a cold, iron-
willed domestic martinet who tramples
on the captain’s self-esteem and confi-
dence, engineering quite callously his
total collapse. Miss Dunn’s performance
is as furiously brilliant as Dayman’s is
emotionally powerful.
The play is essentially concerned with
what Strindberg saw as a never-ending
battle of the sexes, which the antagon-
ists, wotaen, were gradually winning.
Time has made the play, for our
sensibilities, more harrowing than even
Strindberg may have intended. In the
last act, Dayman spends most of his
time on stage neatly trussed irr a strait-
jacket, and at this point the line be-
tween humor and drama is very thin.
Yet the way in which Day'man skilfully
maintains the set, darkly tragic, mood
is a real measure of his considerable
acting talent and of Ballantyne’s careful
control.
Sets, costumes, lighting complement
the proficient acting and direction. In
particular, Murray Rule’s set is cer-
tainly his most accomplished piece of
theatre design to date. It is a carefully
cluttered, sombrely toned, nicely
oppressive Victorian interior, and with-
out it the play’s ’mood would not be so
effectively set and held.
OH, THE SUBTLETY
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
PHYLLIS CURTIN’S recital at the
Sydney Town Hall did much to offset
the bleakness of the weather and not a
little of the warmth generated came
from her associate, Ryan Edwards, who
accompanied the opening Rossini
group with a wealth of sonorous sound.
Miss Curtin’s voice has not the color-
istic spectrum which we usually associ-
ate with a great recitalist, but there
can be few singers who convey
subtleties as well as she can without in
any way disturbing the vocal line.
The “Suleika Leider,” which framed
the Schubert group, are among those
songs which make you catch your
breath, for they are magical. Schubert
could enhance the soggiest doggerel, but
when he alighted on exquisite verse the
result is incomparable. The group, as a
whole, was beautifully sung, and the
opening of the well-known Serenade
had a dewy quality which dispelled any
lingering doubts that we may have had
about Miss Curtin’s art. That highly
prized commodity called “school,”
which often leads to an emotional
strait-jacket in which Lehmann and
Schumann interpretations are embalmed,
was happily absent from this recital,
but we are so used to vocal histrionics
that it was some time before many of


the audience entered Miss Curtin’s
enchanted world.
It is a fairly lightweight person who
goes to the theatre purely for enter-
tainment these days, and if the piece
presented contains no incentive to
thought, the average patron feels done
in the eye. Although Miss Curtin’s
imaginative programing in the second
half, where Faure and Debussy settings
of the same Verlaine poems were con-
trasted, hardly constituted an intel-
lectual exercise for the audience, it
certainly opened up a fascinating field
in the concert hall, which was formerly
confined to musicological demonstra-
tions.
Benjamin Britten can often afford a
violent contrast to Vaughan Williams
in the setting of the same verse, but
despite the tendency of the French to
throw up barricades in the street, they,
as a nation, exhibit an artistic solidarity.
Faure and Debussy differ in accent,
sometimes radically, but their language
is the same. I should imagine that
those members of the audience who
started out by being intrigued by this
experiment, finished up totally
absorbed. Faure at the flood and
Debussy at the source provided a
fascinating excursion into the creative
spirit, and Miss Curtin moved between
the two with sure sensitivity and grace.
The departure of my colleagues on
the dailies which coincides with the
performer reaching the steps off the
platform after the last programmed
item is of course dictated by an immi-
nent deadline but they missed a gem
at this recital: a little South American
romp by Villa-Lobos deliciously under-
stated and tossed off as to the manner
born.
The flame which raced through the
Sydney Orchestra during the Berlioz
“Symphonie Fantastique” in the latest
of the Youth Concert series was but fit-
fully seen in a large part of the “Blue”
concert for the grown-ups. Hindemith’s
“Symphonic Metamorphosis on Themes
of Weber” is a very good piece, but
Hindemith, like Walton, needs a vir-
tuoso performance, and the whole
affair never really got off the ground;
too often the sound was thick and pon-
derous where it should have been full
and vital. This pedestrian sound car-
ried over into the Max Bruch “Violin
Concerto,” which got a solid perform-
ance by Beryl Kimber, but, with the
exception of some beautifully warm yet
finespun tone at the end of the slow
movement, the concerto, like the
Hindemith, failed to take flight.
In the second half one was conscious
of the prevailing dichotomy which
exists in Moshe Atzmon or the orchestra,
or both. We had the “Linz Symphony”
of Mozart performed as a chore,
efficiently as maybe, and the “Hary
Janos Suite” of Kodaly, which exploded
into an electrifying torrent of sound.
Fiddles ripped into their stuff and their
refreshing extroversion was caught up
by the rest of the orchestra and the
whole thing was a joyful noise, with
Atzmon obviously revelling in the con-
trolled pandemonium he had unleashed.
OUR BUSH—AS SEEN BY
POTTER AND PAINTER
ART/ELWYN LYNN
Milton Moon, Pottery. Macquarie Gal-
leries, Sydney.
Gil Jamieson, Paintings. Komon Gal-
lery, Sydney.
ART STYLES work in mysterious
ways, as is evident from the products
of two Queenslanders, Milton Moon’s
implacable ceramics and Gil Jamieson’s
savage, dark, and theatrically colored
paintings of nudes, wild dogs, and
ragged landscapes. You would not
expact to find yourself in the dry, dun-
hued Australian landscape at a pottery
show, and you wouldn’t suspect that
abstract-expressionis'm, supposedly spent
and anathema to our local expressive
realists, would reappear in full force in
Jamieson, who is the legitimate heir
of Molvig, of Brisbane, and the Mel-
bourne Antipodeans. Of the Anti-
podeans, Mr. Greenberg, in his last
lecture in Australia on June 24, pointed
out that abstract-expressionist styles
were still lively in Perceval and,
especially, in Arthur Boyd. This did
not make them abstractionists, but
showed, Greenberg intimated, that a
style just won’t stay in the boundaries
that people like to mark out for it.
It simply shows that a boundary
between realism and abstraction cannot
be drawn.
There is no realistic Imitations of
rocks, bark, local foliage, or leaf-forms
in Moon’s pots, jugs, plates, and vases,
but their presence is evoked übiquit-
ously. In 1962 his work at Komon’s
was received with extremely mixed
feelings, as may be read in Dennis
Pryor’s book on Moon’s work.
Since then his work has become less
jagged, less primitive, less forced, and
more subtly asymmetrical; some of the
tall, cylindrical shapes look like smooth,
. curled bark stripped from a blue gum;
tall vases stained in grey-brown and
fawn are shattered and twisted at the
top as though by weird geological
forces. These combine a tough, urgent
primitivism with the sophisticated
savagery of Voulkos, whom Moon met
on his Churchill Scholarship in 1966,
and who is leader of the remnants of
the abstract expressionist potters of
America of the ’fifties. Moon’s work
doesn’t resemble Voulkos’, for Moon
wants to express the local environment
in his pieces: around the crumbly sur-
face of two, pale fawn, stoppered jugs
runs a faded, yellowed, green glaze that
looks distilled from gumleaves; his
calligraphy on solid bowls and dishes
resembles the lick of smoky flames from
a bushfire.
Some of the robust, covered bowls,
harmoniously proclaiming their utility
and beauty, are often glazed in a pale
olive-green and fawn over the mottled
surfaces that resemble earth and aged
bark. Moon is little concerned with the
pot as sculpture you don’t want to
ask how the facets fit or with the
silhouette, but is intent on trapping
interior forces in his bulbous forms,
which begin on the wheel and then
are given a subtle asymmetry as though
pushed by hidden imprisoned powers.
He uses lots of malachite to give the
pale clay an earthy, granulated look,
because he does not want to disguise
the origin of his materials. The slabby,
tough, cubist vases and the loosely
glazed bulbous bowls are in the tradi-
tion of primitive pottery that makes
Moon, with Marea Gazzard, the lead-
ing expressive potter little concerned
with gracious refinements.
It’s of no aesthetic importance, I
guess, that an expressionist like Jamie-
son sees the bush in a less authentic
way than Moon; he is over-concerned
to render it helter-skelter, slashing about
scumbles of paint hot from his creative
cauldron, but when he is less egocentric
and is enraptured by a real scene, like
Flowering Gums in Moonlight, he is
compelling as the grey-mauve trunks
break into black foliage and melt into
mysterious midnight-blue shadows on
the ground. This and . Irrigation on
Three Moon Flat (a lot of Moons this
week), with its wild trees and a lively
horizon out of Nolde, shows that his
Pottery by Milton Moon
better work derives from European
expressionism and not from the Ameri-
can abstract expressionism, which
swamps Blackboys in paint, that for all
its dash remains frozen and looks
agitated rather than fluently violent. In
Jumping the ill-defined black figures
look as if they were ejected from
gestural abstraction. However, his Wild
Dog, a nasty beast emerging from a
volcano of dark crimson, reds, and
blacks, is impressive just because of its
lack of definition. When he defines his
figures over-much he loads them with
those illustrative features that Mr.
Greenberg found as a drawback in
artists he admired like Dobell, Drys-
dale, Blackman, Perceval, and Arthur
Boyd. Three blacks hung upside down
above a headstone labelled “Trevathon,
treacherously murdered by blacks in
1842” carries too obvious a literary
message just as his Nude and Guitar
carries a too coyly symbolic one.
In one large work, Critics, the shapes
are more open as the horse of creation
gallops over the critics, who look like
intruders into the composition; maybe
they symbolise irrelevant intrusion, but
Jamieson is better as an anguished
observer than a merchant of symbolism.
Moon’s ceramics show how symbols
are visually meaningful just when they
are least literary and illustrative.

NOLAN AND BOYD:
VISIONS OF POETS
AND A SAINT
By ELWYN LYNN
The Voyage and other versions of
poems by Baudelaire. Robert Lowell,
illustrated by Sidney Nolan. Faber
and Faber. 84s. sterling.
St. Francis of Asissi. T. S. R. Boase,
with 16 lithographs by Arthur Boyd.
Thames and Hudson. $6.15.
IF YOU THINK of Sidney Nolan as
the mercurial entertainer with the light
touch and ignore the gnarled carcasses
of 1952 and the large panorama of
the death of Kelly, seen in the local
Retrospective and now on view in
London’s Marlborough, you might
wonder at Nolan’s being the illustrator
of Lowell’s transformations of Baude-
laire’s horror, disgust, and macabre
tenderness, especially as he seemed
simply to decorate Randolph Stow’s
“The Outrider” and the U.S. edition
of Lowell’s “Near the Ocean.”
As these poems appeared under the
title of “Imitations” about six years
ago, it might be assumed that this
pleasantly produced deluxe edition was
to have Nolan veil the Baudelaire-
Lowell obsessively fascinated disgust
with society, but if it were intended
for the coffee table then you would
need Hubert Selby, Sylvia Plath,
Celine, the early Eliot, and Gunter
Grass around for coffee, because
Nolan’s blandness and the bejewelled
romanticism sparked off by Shake-
speare’s sonnets have nothing of the
haunting intensity of the sad, ape-like
features that loom from the sooty mist
to illustrate Lowell’s:
“It’s Boredom. Tears have glued its
eyes together. You know it well, my
Reader. This obscene beast chain-
smokes yawning for the guillotine
you hypocrite Reader my double
my brother!”
The “worn-out sponge who scuffles
through our slums” is a bird of prey
and the shredded, flaccid, and bestial
flesh of “horny, pot-bellied tyrants
stuffed on lust” is as disturbing as the
illustration of the “Ferocious vultures
(that) choking down thick blood,
gutted the hanging man.” Of course,
Nolan’s images are about the whole
poems and not about the lines he
chooses to attach to them; this results
in the vagueness that Robert Hughes
complained of in the “Spectator,” but
Nolan is after the multiple associations
of, say, Delacroix, whom Baudelaire
idolised.
Nolan can be as viciously relentless
as Lowell, but he catches the gloomy
tenderness appropriate to the old ser-
vant, now dead. “The dead, the poor
dead, they have their bad hours,” and
if the Siren, the spectre, whose accents
they know so well, who hovers over
the voyagers of the Dead Sea, has a
cushionly motherliness in her cosy,
crimson-pink nightdress, maybe Nolan
knows that Sirens are not all mini-
skirted.
The illustrations owe much of their
success to Nolan’s interest in the out-
cast, the wandering explorer and those
defiant but despairing souls who
fascinate Baudelaire; and, in the last
analysis, for Nolan and Baudelaire-
Lowell, the myth of those sated with
despair is affirmative, and as Lowell’s
version has it: they “drown in the
abyss, heaven or hell, who cares?
Through the unknown we’ll find the
new.”
The story, or partial legend, of St.
Francis, retold by T. S. R. Boase,
the English art historian, is of one who
saw a sure way to salvation through
material poverty, but had none of the
despair and emotional poverty that
Baudelaire saw all around. In Boase’s
preface to this revised version of his
1936 account, he quotes the 1959
Antipodean Manifesto, spuriously resur-
rected in the current “ART and Aus-
tralia,” on the notion that in “the
growth and transformation of its myths,
a society achieves its own sense of
identity”; well, Clif Pugh put St.
Francis in actual hessian among the
crows and dingos of the north, but
Boyd’s black-and-white lithographs
have nothing to do with transforming
social myths and they are not so eerily
brutal as Boase thinks. Most are more
related to the feathery, mirage-like
pastels he did in 1964-5 some are
lithographic versions and if the
leper is a biomorphic oddity and St.
Francis’ father rages with Old Testa-
ment and Expressionist wrath, St.
Francis and the Harlot in flames and
the amalgamation of St. Francis with
the Wolf of Gubbio have none of the
haunting bitterness of Boyd’s Nebu-
chadnezzar or Nolan’s Baudelaire illus-
trations.
Boyd’s is a random, free translation
of the story, just as St. Francis, in a
manner to become dangerous in later
centuries, used to open the Gospels at
random for guidance; it allows Boyd
to use a childlike, folk-art innocence,
and, at times, an emotional intensity
appropriate to the Saint’s life. Gener-
ally gentle, they have none of the wiry
insistence of his lithographs of 1962-3.
Naturally, as one could expect from
Boyd, they owe nothing to the great
“illustrators” of St. Francis Giotto,
Sassetta, Bellini, or El Greco but are
personal, unorthodox, and fine artistic
parallels rather than illustrations.
Since Boyd and Nolan are in danger
of becoming saints, it’s well to turn to
their fellow in resisting being conven-
tionalised, St. Francis: when he was
near death and close to Sainthood he
was told that his request for some lute
music might shock the devout. “Let
it be,” he said, “it is better to be with-
out good things than to scandalise
others.” But when he awoke from a
Nolan ... disturbing illustrator
sleep soon afterward, he said that the
angels had been playing to him. Maybe
artists like Nolan and Boyd resist
orthodoxy best when they turn to the
legends and attitudes of such as Bau-
delaire, Rimbaud, St. Francis, and
Nebuchadnezzar.
FIVE TIMES REBORN
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Story Teller. Peter Vansittart.
Peter Owen. $5.75.
THE HISTORICAL novel is not dead
not while authors like Peter Vansit-
tart can inject the apparently worn-
out mould with such a vibrant new
form of life. “The Story Teller” takes
the imaginative daydreams of an old
Swedish councillor as point of depar-
ture: as he sits immobile in the
Scandinavian sun like some celluloid
character wandered in from an Ingmar
Bergman cutting-room floor, he lets
his mind float back through five other
momentous periods in history, peopling
them again and again, right down
through the centuries, with the same
central figures in the same sort of
situations, showing history repeating
itself, mistakes and all, with monot-
onous regularity; demonstrating that
the good old days of today were in
reality the bad old days of yester-
day; that individuals may die but that
life goes on and on; and that every
man is different while he yet remains
basically the same, constantly forced to
renew himself in each generation in
his own image. In fact, rarely before

has the sense of the continuity of
human life come across as clearly and
effortlessly as in this novel.
Old councillor S’s flights of fancy
can be seen either as almost schizo-
phrenic escapes from his surroundings
into more distant worlds of the imagin-
ation, or as genuine atavistic recall
through an inherited memory passed
on to him by his ancestors, or as an
actual belief in the spiritual if not
perhaps also in physical reincarnation.
The choice is left to the reader.
The hero, Storm, the storyteller’s
own self-projection, is first met in Hol-
stein in the 14th century during the
period of the Hundred Years’ War,
when in filth, squalor, and ignorance, a
revolutionary Christ-figure is brutally
recrucified; then comes the 17th cen-
tury and the Thirty Years’ War to
fulfil Luther’s prophecy that God
creates life by slaughter; then Storm
is reborn in Paris during the Terror,
and Danton’s Long Live Me policy and
Marat’s last bath; next comes Berlin
in all its Prussian post-Bismarck pom-
posity under Emperor Wilhelm II;
and, finally, the chaos of 20th-century
Sweden in the ’thirties, with Hitler’s
goose-steppers just outside the door.
Each slice of history coincides with
a different season of the year, each
rebirth of the hero with a new stage
of maturity, and with a sense of having
been here before. But the problems he
has to face are always the same. Com-
plete material success always eludes
him. He goes through all his lives
hungrily seeking for the great love
which alone can transform the dross
of merely existing into the gold of
absolute fulfilment, only to have it
dissolve instantly under his touch every
time. The woman, too, is always the
same, though in different guises, so is
the tyrant father and the mother-
mistress figure the “virgin wife.”
There is always, on the one hand,
the human preoccupation with “holy”
wars for what war is not beatified
by man if not by God with religion
without piety, with dark power, passion,
and destruction, but it is balanced, on
the other, with re-creation, with
spiritual renewal, with revelation in
art, with the bountiful eternal love-
death of Nature, and with the sheer
miraculous joy of simply being alive,
anywhere, anyhow, anytime. Each age
is treated as a microcosm in which the
trivial, the fashionable, the extrava-
gances of clothes and decoration, the
small epicurean pleasures of luscious
foods and connoisseur wines are care-
fully drawn in, side by side, with the
large-scale curves of world catastrophes
and universal progress, the alternate
eras of darkness and light, of barbaric
ritual murder, and of triumphant
radiant resurrection. For life is lived
among small things in the shadow of
large events.
All this, however, might simply
have become another scholarly work
from another Oxonian historian, if it
were not for the new, individual, com-
pletely contemporary style which Peter
Vansittart has evolved for the actual

telling. The novel reads strangely at
first, like a distilled essence of language,
rather like Gertrude Stein in a benign
mood, doodling off-duty. No other com-
parison seems appropriate. The author
uses words like bones from which he
has cut away all unnecessary flesh,
pared down to heavy syllables, gram-
matically shorn of the article “the”
or “a” whenever possible, so that when
he does choose to use an article it falls
with enormous force.
Like Stein, he gives sensation back
to words and so heightens reality
whether he is making the roses bloom
more brightly before the reader’s eye,
the scented flavor of wild strawberries
linger on the palate, the sea writhe like
a wise old monster, guarding its secrets
from the shore, or letting the snow fall
like silent counter-point against the
unheard music of the spheres. No re-
view of such a style would be complete
without a typical example chosen at
random:
“Faces blossomed anew, adventures
swirled on wings, charged on hoofs,
took shape, lost it, reassembled, flaring
like planets . . . ‘Who’s to be killed?’

children of Brutus unto the hundred-
and-eightieth generation. Enthroned
under the eye of St. Rousseau they
strove for an embrace, giant, irresist-
ible, final . . . Thumping for mobilisa-
tion, swopping bottles and grins, no
one sure of how serious the joke was,
what was really being promised, but
shouting for tall hat and papers. This
was what made revolutions, trespassed
on churches, manipulated nations, con-
victed tyrants, so that the sky would
pour with gods to fertilise the stricken
earth.”
THE HOLY MAN
At every village there were hands,
suppliants in a wordless rustling
frenzy
struggling to touch his robe, his skin.
And he stopping from time to time,
smiled with beneficent humility,
while his shuddering flesh
received their tribute.
At every village there were hands
they flickered round him
like a hundred serpents’ tongues.
Worse: it was as if the hands
were animals themselves
could see and hear (not only feel)
even as if they tasted him.

ELDERS
Here is the go-go generation, all
Around me, hemming me in where

Like centuries of trees to saplings.
The day
Is a shadeless din of dancing. But
these, in their way,
Though free the dance, know that
they are not free,
That near them the winds of wars
whistle and wait,
That the frenzy of their elders made
their fate.
They know that, for every century
and tree,
There is a time to fall, and the elders
gone
Should not begrudge the younger then
their own
Seeming supremacies and shouted
needs,
The past showing its shoots or sowing
seeds.
But these here go stamping, I fear,

An old virtue not even the elders

NERVOUS TALES
By JOHN BAXTER
End of the Game and other stories.
Julio Cortazar. Collins & Harvill
Press. $3.15.
THE USUALLY shrewd Collins
organisation may have missed a good
bet in failing to issue this collection as
“Blow Up and other stories.” Julio
Cortazar’s main claim to fame is cer-
tainly the fact that Michelangelo
Antonioni chose one of these nervous
tales as the basis of his successful film,
and for his publishers to ignore this
selling point and rely instead on the
shaky critical edifice currently being
erected for Cortazar on the strength of
his novel “Hopscotch” may prove the
author’s downfall.
Throughout this omnibus collection
of Cortazar’s last three volumes of
short stories and novelettes, the writer
seems generally to have been poorly
served by his publishers. The trans-
lation from the Spanish is frequently
halting, and the very presentation-
-15 short and medium-length stories;
more than five years’ work in one
volume—is likely to destroy whatever
reputation the writer has built up.
Emerging from the end of this collec-
tion, all but the toughest readers must
find themselves a little queazy from
overexposure to Cortazar’s eccentric
vision of the world.
Sipped rather than gulped, however,
the stories in “End of the Game”
prove interesting, if a little overripe.
Cortazar’s specialty is the enigmatic
glimpse of mental disturbance, the peek
through a keyhole into a world that has
decayed into madness. One can under-
stand Antonioni’s interest in -the story
“Blow Up,” where a young photog-
rapher examining in detail a simple
park shot finds in it a 'threat which
becomes magnified as he enlarges the
picture. Unfortunately, the refining pro-
cess by which the film was turned into
an engaging thriller removed the air of
windswept frenzy which distinguishes
the story’s climax.
“Blow Up” is among the author’s
furthest excursions into experimental
form. When he stays closer to con-
ventional patterns of thought his
stories are often magnificently sinister
and macabre. “The Night Face Up”
is a horror story worthy of Theodore
Sturgeon, its modern hero slipping back

into the past in moments of coma after
an accident and imagining himself as
an Aztec sacrifice bound face up on the
bloody stone. “. . . he managed to
close his eyelids again, although he
knew now he was not going to wake
up, that he was awake, that the mar-
vellous dream had been the other,
absurd as all dreams are a dream
in which he was going through the
strange avenues of an astonishing city
... In the infinite lie of the dream,
they had also picked him up off the
ground, someone had approached him,
also, with a knife in his hand,
approached him who was lying face
up, face up with his eyes closed between
the bonfires on the steps.”
This is what Cortazar does well; the
brief excursion into horror, the smooth
exposition of a premise which, with
each new departure from reality, be-
comes subtly more terrifying. “The Idol
of the Cyclades,” “House Taken Over,”
“Axolotl”—translated with more skill,
these stories would grace any reputable
quarterly of new writing or, by the
same token, any high-quality TV horror
series. All the more unfortunate, then,
that the author should spend so much
of this volume on long novelettes
which, for turgid rhetoric and feeble
development of plot, are rivalled only
by the worst quasi-literary excess of
America’s avant-garde.
“The Pursuer” is a good example of
Cortazar at his worst. A crudely dis-
guised biography of jazz musician
Charlie Parker and his last months in
Paris, it reads like a teenager’s version
of reality derived from a faulty reading
of “Downbeat” and “Partisan Review.”
Jazz enthusiasts will wince at the
gratuitous slang “cat,” “dig,” “cool,
man” -- and deplore the misspellings,
half-digested jazz criticism, and
ludicrous name-dropping. Paul Black-
burn’s erratic translation serves only to
underline the worthlessness of these
stories, as in other cases it makes one
wish to read clearer and more accurate
accounts of Cortazar’s often fine work.
Letters
"Crazy guys"
Observer’s comments (8., June 15) on
political shootings in America were
refreshingly sensible. As was so cor-
rectly pointed out, “complex societies
cannot be described simply in terms of
some particular sensational occasion.”
We know there is violence in America,
as there is violence in so many other
countries, but the act of a lone misfit,
tragic as it may 'be, must be seen in
perspective.
While everything possible must be
done to protect those who hold public
office the powerful gun lobby in
America should be cut down to size,
for instance there have always been
and there will always be misfits,
fanatics, men with an “inward para-
noid tendency”; “these old floaters,
these crazy guys,” as one American
sociologist recently labelled them. If
such a person really has an assassina-
tion in mind, he will carry it out. But
as Observer said, “We should keep our
heads.” The deep-seated and the
strikingly real problems that can be
analysed and which do yield to action
the problems that John and Robert
Kennedy both tried so hard to solve
are the important ones.

Saigon revisited
In “Saigon Revisited” by Peter Samuel
(8., June 1): “ ‘Give us time and hard-
ware and we can’t take over the job
of the Americans’ is the theme in
Saigon at the moment.” Did Mr.
Samuel write truer than he thought?
Some few years ago our leading
politician returned from a brief journey
to the United States and at a Press
interview he was reported over TV as
saying (with regard to Vietnam),
“Things will get better before they get
worse.” As far as I could check, no one
noticed this remarkable statement, and
one, therefore, wonders how much
regard the public gives to the enormous
quantity of words distributed by Press,
radio, and television.

Opera House organ
I understand that the organ for the
Sydney Opera House will be built by
Ron Sharp, using imported Dutch
pipes, will be of four manuals, and of
mechanical action. Again, before going
further, let me make it quite clear that
I have nothing against this form of
organ in its proper place a cnurch;
but will someone please tell me what
earthly use this form of organ will
be in a hall which has to cater not
only for concerts but also conventions,
probably also major social functions.
It is regrettable that in so many in-
stances we in Australia get involved
in trends many years after they have
been tried and discarded overseas. In
the United States, there are literally
scores of examples where musicians of
more temperament than ability have
forced various municipal authorities to
install these inflexible mechanical-
action organs, only to find them abso-
lutely abhorrent to the greater percent-
age of users of the halls and pass into
complete disuse. Yet on the other side
of the picture where an organ is chosen
with a view to its suitability for the
maximum general use, we have the
instrument as a focal point in the
musical life of the hall.
It is still not too late. Ron Sharp-
is well capable of building a modern in-
strument for a modern hall; but if we
must go- back to the 16th century
why not do away with the sail roof of
the Opera House and replace it with
nice modern “thatched effect.”

Student power
Your article on the open forum held
at the University of New South Wales
(8., June 22) clearly did not give a
correct impression of what happened.
The students’ “non-emotional response"
was a way of mildly describing, with
sympathy, the complete rout suffered
by the infant Student Power move-
ment. Strangely this rout was inflicted
not by the administration but by the
students themselves.
It appears ALF, the organisers, were
too busy congratulating themselves on
arranging the historical meeting with a
peer of a university administration to
have seriously considered a plan of
attack. Naturally the result was farci-
cal; confirming that Dr. Dowlings’
“academic rubbish" indeed exists.
However, the blame lies not with a
small clique of activists but with the
bulk of students who, well knowing the-
deficiencies of UNSW (and there are
many), sit perpetually on their bums
in a state of vegetation being moulded
by an archaic education system and
sampling the flavor of university life
by playing cards in the Roundhouse
and viewing the weekly movies.
The revolution at UNSW will not
die, it will simply and regrettably just
fade away under an overpowering
blanket of Australian apathy.
