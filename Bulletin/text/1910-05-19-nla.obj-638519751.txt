The RED PAGE
Our Literary Future—with a Word
about the Past.
Furnley Maurice :
Mr. Esson preaches (Red Page, 14/4/’10)
a vile and enervating decadence that
accepts all the tragedy of life, all the
terrible experiences and subtle changes
in men’s minds, merely as subjects for
art. He quotes Synge: “Are they not
interesting, then, when they are going
mad ? ” Interesting ! Surely that is a
hideous word as it stands there. Is this all
that the poet has to bring to world-
weary men '( If this is the attitude of the
poet toward life, then our Australia is
happy in possessing no poet. By that
utterance one judges Synge to have been a
sort of effeminate ogre gorging himself with
human misery for his own amusement.
Why is there all this worry about art and
literature ? These things are not important.
The only important thing in the world is in-
dustry—doing the best you can as earnestly
as you can. Utilitarianism (the ugliest word
that ever crawled into the critics’ vocabulary)
is, and has been, the one inspiring force,
the one practical foundation of everything
that was ever of any importance to human
life. The way these art-and-poet-people
talk, one would imagine that the Milan
‘Cathedral (that will do for the argument)
was designed and completed purely for art’s
sake, and that the people afterwards acci-
dentally discovered that if you got inside it,
it would keep off the wet.
‘ ‘ Our irrational rationalism, our extrava-
gant waste of energy in business, our im-
nioral worship of work, our deplorable sanity
and health and common-sense do not make
for joy or beauty or splendor.” Now, what
is joy and what is beauty, and what is
splendor 'i It is not possible to argue on
tnose subjects without agreeing, to some ex-
tent, on what the words mean ; and if Mr.
Esson accepts the meaning put upon the
terms by the artistic faculty, then he draws
himself away from the people, and only from
the people can we receive true inspiration ;
and only by informing and enlarging the
outlook and sympathies of the people can art
or literature perform its true function.
The “ cult ” forget that there are stronger
and deeper forces in life than the “aesthetic”
force. There is patriotism, there is ambi-
tion, there is religion, and there is the pur-
suit of material comfort: and all these
things come before art in the estimation of
the most estimable citizen. Society is made
up of estimable citizens; and if there were
Ho such society there would be none to
listen to the cries of the • broken-hearted
“ cult,” and as the aesthetes would not exist
if there were nothing to weep about, there
would also be no “ cult.” For what I
understand by the word “art” is an un-
natural, forced and artificial- parasite that
tangles itself about the splendid principle of
utilitarianism, and clogs the wheels of pro-
gress.
' And when the art force, the youngest, most
ineffectual and frailest of the life forces, rises
up and demands that life and our philoso-
phies shall be altered to its requirements,
and that art in itself is infallible and com-
plete, then those people who look at life in
a wider manner congratulate themselves on
their “deplorable sanity and health” and
continue digging. Art may be the rose in
the lapel of civilisation, but there are thou-
sands of occasions when one must necessarily
prefer some more edible vegetable to which
the aesthete hangs his withering curse of
“utilitarian.” For art does not matter and
literature does not matter either—there is
more in life than any diseased imagination
ever read into it, there is more in life than
any self-conscious poet ever drew out of it.
Life is the only absolute theme, but we should
not nullify our consciousness of its vastness
and mystery by splitting it into little depart-
ments and allying ourselves to a part and
neglecting the whole.
Mr. Esson speaks of the happiness of lazy
countries, where the people have leisure to
learn howto live. I think they are learning
how to die, because leisure is the first step
toward national and individual decomposi-
tion. What right has a man to demand
happiness or leisure or anything else jf Who
said that we were all to be made happy by
looking at fuzzy pictures and reading dreamy
poems ? Restrained by those primary laws
of repression and moderation which the
social system demands, a man can have real
faith only in that which he instinctively
"'loves and feels attracted toward. If he
■must go mad to do a great work, by all means
.let him go mad, but he cannot be consciously
attracted toward madness ; and if he begins
to advocate insanity as the key to greatness,
then he has lost his grip of the principles of
human existence, his attitude to life has
become affected and diseased.
“The Bush can inspire lyric deliciousness
and tragic grandeur.” Personally, I never
could see anything “grand” about tragedy,
but I know that the Bush itself is far more
grand and impressive and splendid than
anything it might inspire in art or literature.
And when Mr. Esson informs us in what
manner we are to be inspired and in what
manner we are to express our joyousness (he
suggests that we should emulate the Greeks),
is he not stifling originality, aiid in indicat-
ing what is to be seen and what felt, is he
not violating one of the principles of his own
doctrine, which is supposed to give the
widest liberties to temperament and in-
dividuality, diseased, or naturally insane ?
And which is the more important, a cow, or
a cow seen through a temperament ? *
Australia will get her literature when she
deserves it, when she has earned it by her
effort, her aspiration, her success and her
failure ; but Australia will get no literature
by chasing pretty words with her hat like a
boy after butterflies. You have to work
hard to earn a literature, and you must not
work in expectation of that literary result,
or you will spoil everything by becoming
artistic and self-conscious. Australia must
go forward and take its chances whether or
not there be a literature and an arthiddenin
her future. We must go forward. Although
they have served excellently in the past, still
we must try to forget “the vain songs of
ancient heathendom, the trifling legends, the
funeral chants.”
;.' * * »
J. A. Garland :
To rely upon the “ sane, vigorous and
humorous ” people to build up a national
literature leaves my poor country with a very
forlorn hope indeed- Nor must we go to
the other extreme and look to the insane.
Our hopes must centre upon the unsccne and
the melancholy—two separate phases of
jnind, yet almost always interlocked.
By melancholy I do not mean the state of
the poor fool who sits in a corner with his
head in his hands and whines for the death
which, in most cases, he receives like a
craven; but the melancholy which is be-
gotten by one’s perceiving the note of pain
that does throb through humanity, and which
is eased, not by stifling it for a moment with
the wine of laughter, but by showing the
grandeur and beauty that is one with it.
Eliminate the melancholy and unsane from
the world’s literature, and what have we
left ? Bather a small remnant, I fancy.
■* * * *
Hannibal :
On the question of sanity in literature, a
perusal of Hirsch’s Genius and Insanity will
show how large is the number of great
writers who were regarded as insane. And
was not the best literature of the nineteenth
century produced by men who are listed and
condemned by Max Nordau in Degeneration ?
A little of the insanity of Blake, a little of
the abnormality of James and Francis
Thompson, of Baudelaire or Beardsley, or a
few “degenerates” like Rossetti and Swin-
burne would be very welcome in Australia.
*'* # *
Boderic Quinn :
The duel on the Bed Page as to the
character which our literature of the future
is likely to take was of much interest. Ido
not wish to express an opinion on the merits
of the contestants’ sword-play ; but I should
like to say that the history of Australia’s
past is of no small importance in any con-
sideration of our future.
Our early history is certainly lacking in any-
thing of heroic magnitude, if the story of the
Pioneers be omitted ; but, even with such an
admission, the retrospective eye need not
despair of discovering on the long road we
have trodden the makings of a book or a
poem that may well win the attention of
men. It may be true that the incidents of
our origin are lacking in romance ; but it may
be true also that the reason of' this is that
sufficient perspective is also lacking.
Marcus Clarke gave us one aspect of our
past in His Natural Life , a lurid and dread-
ful aspect; but that book by no means
exhausted the materials. There are other and
more pleasing phases of that period which
deserve treatment at the hands of an artist.
And there are episodes in the bushranging
period which, viewed in the proper perspec-
tive, would make fit subjects for romance.
The period of England’s greatest imaginative
energy was. also the period when public
admiration made laurelled heroes of lawless
buccaneers, ltomance excuses Drake and
Morgan when, with their following of pirates,
they raided the Spanish Main, cutting throats
and looting galleons ; or when, lurking in
the fever-stricken jungle that bordered the
“ gold road,” they listened for the jingle of
bells that told of an approaching treasure-
train of mules on its weary way from Panama
to Nombre de Dios. Similarly, to the
imagination of the young mind of Australia
the exploits of her bushrangers appealed
as something not without glory.
What a series of magnificent themes lie at
the disposal of the man who desires to write
the great Australian novel! Much American
literature concerns itself with the two great
wars of that country ; but I like this type of
literature less than the literature which takes
as its subject-matter the third great war—
the war which never ceases, the war in which
man conquers the torrent and breaks the
cliff and throws down the mountain. It is
only in new and spacious countries like
America and Australia that such a struggle
takes on Homeric proportions, and a fit
description of it requires epical treatment.
Here, as in America, man has been at
throat-grips with Nature from the beginning ;
and he is still fighting with unrelaxed fingers.
There is the story of the roads—the
great main roads that follow the track
made by a questing fellow years ago.
There is the story of the stock routes, of
the lowing herds, moving down great dis-
tances, and of the patient men behind them.
To the writer of imagination, Australia offers
inspiration without limit—man’s war with,
fire, man’s war with flood, man’s war with
drought; and the story of each of these wars
should fill a volumo vital with interest.
Where will the writer of the great Aus-
tralian book be born, and what shall be his en-
vironment? Shall we look for his coming
in the cities or in the interior ? Cer-
tainly not in the cities. The cities are
seats of old-world sameness. Sydney and
Melbourne are brick and mortar repetitions
of London and Manchester. They are. im-
ported environment, and that means an
imported mental outlook. The writer of
our great book of the future must not think
in old-world terms; ho must think as an
Australian. The cities war against origi-
nality. It would costume itself as the
bright Australian sun and warm Aus-
tralian nights make appropriate; they
compel it to dress in heavy old-world
apparel. It would think spaciously, in
accordance with the inspiration of three
million square miles of country. They
narrow it in with walls and windows, and
restrict and' rob it of novelty and scope. It
would love to touch old themes with new
lights—-to view human nature through a
medium of sunshine. They teach it to look
at the old things in the stereotyped way of
our forefathers. If the Australian wishes to
preserve his individuality, he will discover
the necessity of shouldering his swag and
getting away Outback for a time.
Chantecler
Rostand’s career as a dramatic author has
been a succession of triumphs. Les Roman-
esques and La Princesse Lointaine paled before
the magnificence of Cyrano de Bergerac, which,
in its turn, was almost eclipsed by the
chauvinistic appeal as much as by the poetry
of L’Aiglon. The accounts of the Chantecler
performances which have reached us show
that his latest poetic drama has satisfied all
the requirements of exacting Parisian audi-
ences ; and, from the box-office point of view,
is likely to b,e a greater success than any of
its predecessors. The text of the drama is
now published in book form (Angus and
Robertson), and some kind of an English
translation is to appear shortly.
In Chantecler Rostand has astonished—
almost mesmerised —the audience and the
reader by the trick of his originality ; for
although there is nothing new in the per-
sonification of animals and birds, nor in
their satiric employment, the presentment of
love and art and society in feathers has given
a jaded world a new shiver.
Rostand’s satire of manners is but the
comedy of Wilde and Pinero transfigured by
bird-skins, salted, by the way, in Gaul. The
satire on human shortcomings is at least as
old as Timon (we can always be sure of the
instability of human nature) ; but the love
motive and the art motive, the cock’s song
and the passion of the hen pheasant are new
and enchanting—a rare dramatic statement
of the two great verities.
The third act is the most powerful, and the
duel between the Fighting Cock and Chan-
tecler must play with remarkable force. In
this scene Rostand has clearly hit the
Parisienne who haunted recent prize fights,
and the lust of the mass for gore. When the
wounded Chantecler, as the shadow of the
Hawk passes and repasses, gathers the farm
yard to his paternal protection, and, the
danger past, everyone rushes for his seat
and the resumption of the fight, a magnifi-
cent chance is afforded for his rejection of
the world—so he goes off to the forest
with the Hen Pheasant, after conquering his
foe and denouncing his acquaintance,
Of the lyrics, the ode to the sun (quoted
here 14/4/TO), for all its fancy, owes more
than a touch of its quality to Baudelaire’s
innovation —the magic in things common —
as' in the third verse :
Je te chante, et tu peux m'aeeepter pour ton
pretre,
Toj qui viens dans la cuve oh trernpe un savon
bleu,
Et qui choisis souvent, quand tu vas disparaitre,
L’humble vitre d’une fenetre
Pour lanoer ton dernier adieu !
The Cock’s praise of the light would please
any modern landscape painter, and his con-
viction that he raises the sun is a flight of
superb fancy:
. . . Ma voix dispense la clarte
Et quand le ciel est gris, e’est que j’ai mal chante
is prettily turned.
The morale of Chantecler is edifying and
artistic. Faith dead, and Egotism shaky,
the duty to the work still remains. The
EDMOND ROSTAND.
From World's Work.
eternally Feminine, represented by the
Hen Pheasant, fights hard for love as
the be-all of existence, but, unwilling to
share it with a noble abstraction, loses her
lover (woman has always been a materialist
in fact as in fancy) ; while the Cock singer,
like Whitman of a plain song, lias faith in his
powers slain, and goes back to his work as the
clock of the dawn, like a man. We cannot
all make the sun rise, and our work may not
be as important as we imagine—still we can
ply our calling honestly.
Rostand has wit, fancy, a delicate sense
of character, and as a dramatist touches the
largest of human issues.
“ Quand on suit regarder et souffrir on sait tout.
Dans une inort d’insecte on voit tousles desastres
Up rond d’azur sufiit pour voir passer les astres.”
Scattered through his play are some noble
and beautiful passages of poetry—but Ros-
tand is a dramatist first.
L. L.
Dr. Wallace’s much-advertised article in
Harper’ 3 Magazine for March on the docu-
ments relating to Shakespeare discovered by
him after a long search in the Records
Office, London, is roughly handled by the
vigilant Greenwood in the National Review
for April. There was a great deal of sack to
a small amount of bread in the Wallace
article, and Greenwdod claims that the dis-
covery only, shows “ Shakspeare ” of Strat-
ford as a bourgeois among bourgeois, lodging
with “ tiremaker ” Mountjoy, and doing a
little “broka'ge” in the marriage market;
but that there is not a word to suggest the
great poet and dramatist—“ Shakespeare,”
then at the zenith of his fame.
Greenwood’s book, The Shakespeare Case
Restated , was largely drawn upon by Mark
Twain in his amusingly serious Is Shakespeare
Dead? This suggested an ingenious skit,
“Is Mark Twain Dead.?”, which appeared
in the North American Review last Sep-
tember. The author produced a cipher,
proving that the real author of the recent
publications over the name of Mark Twain
was Elbert Hubbard ! Hoaxes of a similar
kind have been fairly common since Don-
nelly’s. Great Cryptogram. The Sydney Star,
in reprinting the N. A. Review article, seems
to have taken it in solemn earnest.

Moore gives a moving picture of part of Gold-
smith’s life; but Boswell’s is better Dodo:
Split your infinitives if you think it absolutely
necessary. There are good precedents for the
splits. See Lounsbury’s The Standard of Usage
in English A.H.L. : You say that Marlowe
has only repeated the Homeric method of sug-
gesting Helen’s beauty by describing its effect.
The point is that Marlowe put the whole effect in
two lines. Now add up the lines in Homer which
make up his (or rather, their) picture of Helen.

organs of the bod}', it turns out disease, it keeps the system free from illness, it

CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“ lb was subsequent bo mv m-oa.t illness in a Victorian hospital that
I first took Clements Tonic. As my friends and a section of the
public know, I was very ill for six months. After taking four bottles
of your nerve remedy X improved, and found that it was a splendid
aid to Nature, as my nerves soon regained their usual strength, my
heart’s action became regular and strong, and my appetite increased
wonderfully. At present I enjoy splendid health. lam seldom ill,
and I declare it is due to the consistent use of your splendid Tonic
medicine. lam never without it in the house. Neither my wife nor
I can afford to be, as we both use and swear by it as the best of
medicines.”
(Signed) ALBERT MORRIS.
No home, farm, squatter’s station, factory, or traveller’s kit should be without
Clements Tonic. It is a necessary medicine for mankind, for correcting the stomach,
regulating the bowels, invigorating the nerves, clearing the brain, and purifying the
blood. For over 25 years it has been declared by experts to be the standard medical
tonic of Australia, and the thousands of testimonials received prove its great efficacy.
All chemists and stores sell it in Australia. It is health in a new guise. Send for it.

BLED TO DEATH
«
NOBODY KNEW FIRST-AID.
»
MELBOURNE, Wednesday.
In the absence of the knowledge of the prin-
ciples of first-aid by those about him, Thomas
Howland, farmer, 50 years of age, bled to death
to-day at his home, four miles from Dirnboola.
Howland knocked an ulcerous sore and burst a
varicose vein near the ankle. His daughter
attempted to stanch the bleeding by applying
flour, but this had no effect, and he died within
10 minutes.
The above news item will serve to show how fallacious
is the opinion held by many sufferers from Varicose
Veins that they are “ really not dangerous.”
If you suffer from Varicose Veins, or have a relation or
friend who does, and if the veins should burst, would you
know what to do ? Let us send you an illustrated free
book describing Varicose Veins in all their forms, the
methods to adopt in bandaging, and the course to pursue
if they should hurst. This book also fully describes the
Vecsey Method of treating and curing Varicose Veins
without operations.
To sufferers from Varicose Veins the Vecsey Method of
Treatment comes as a great boon. Previous to its dis-
covery no painless, permanent palliative was known.
lt| cures the veins absolutely, and once cured they do
not return.
Do not fail to send for our free book, which gives full
information arid particulars. Post free to any address
upon receipt of 2d. stamp. Call for free advice.

WHEN THE WIND BLOWS
from three or four directions at the same
time it is quite natural to expect coughs
and colds—these should not be left to run
their course, but should be treated promptly
by. taking
BONNINGTON’S

This splendid remedy acts like a charm
and will cure the most persistent cough
or cold.
The cost is so small that it is foolish to endanger your lungs and
perhaps your life by allowing a cold to run on.
All Chemists and Medicine Vendors stock “ BONNINGTON’S IRISH

Hyde Park, Sydney.
From the little balcony.
High above the street, I see
After sunset how the park
Changes in the growing dark.
For by day the flowers show,
Scarlet salvia, row on row,
Oleander, tamarisk.
Flaming near the obelisk :
Frank blue sky and fair green grass
Smile a welcome as w r e pass.
But the sun has set —behold 1
Shining bubbles all of gold
Hanging from the altered trees :
What strange magic gave us these?
Are they golden fruife,of nigh.t,
"Shedding an enchanted light ?
Here the grass shows greensr far
Than the earthly grasses are,
From some stage-land forest scene
Comes that wild and hectic-green.
Down the centre of the park,
Like toy trees from Noah’s Ark,
Stand the fig-trees lopped last spring;
And the fresh leaves burgeoning
Straight from out the trunks, show bright,
Polished in the stagey light.
Everywhere that light has made
Pools of color, shores of shade,
Till familiar corners seem
Vague, remote its in a dream.
From the balcony by day
One sees very (hr away ;
When the sunset colors die
One by one upon the sky.
Then the
Till the-witch-parhrhas no end.
It could reachUo touch a star. . ..
Never daylighjfshowed so far.
But at dawn it wakens, plain.
Unbewitched and frank again.
Those gold apples in the dark

Ballade of the Road.
Between the living and the dead,
Our wakinfer and our sleep between,
A ribbon, dark with hues of dread.
That links the hidden with the seen,
The Road winds on through Might Have Been,
By fairy glades of Gone Before,
Through dream and doom, by shade and sheen,
For evermore—for evermore !
And leaden heart or drooping head.
By rolling dune, by runnelled dene,
Still onward sweep the legions, led
By Judas or by Nazarene ;
And Folly blears, with blots unclean,
The rainbow raiment Beauty wore,
And Fancy mourns her exiled queen
For evermore—for evermore !
The spilt wine flashes rosy red ;
But pale, pale are their lips, I ween,
Who break with Dearth her bitter bread.
And drink with Loss her vintage lean ;
Their sighs are sadder than the keen
Of night winds on a reedy shore,
Where widowed Grief’s grey children glean
For evermore—for evermore !
Envoy.
Sahara stark, savanna green, «
Though life be cankered to the core,
The Road winds on through Fate’s demesne
For evermore—for evermore !

MARIE E. J. PITT.
Old Romance.
I made my dear a garland
Of roses, red and white,
White for her dream of Heaven,
Red for her heart’s delight.
In cardboard-box and tissue
A small boy took it down ;
He said, as he returned it,
“The fambly’s hout ov town !”
I wrote my dear a letter
That made sweet moan for love
(Some other fellow, damn him,
Was buttoning her glove !)
In joy and trepidation
I mailed it to my own ;
The Post Office returned it
Inscribed : “ Address unknown !”
I sang my dear a ballade
Of anguish, loye and tears —
Tears for her cruel silence,
And anguish for my fears.
I sent it to-a paper
Yclept The Bulletin ;
She read it on the wrapper
The breakfast meat came in !
I met my dear one morning
Where Ocean-breakers roared
(The other fellow, damn him,
Looked just the least bit bored);
A slip of crimson paper
Fell from her satin purse. . .
She blushed when I returned it;
Ye stars, it was my verse !
I saw my dear in King-street
When to the club I raced ;
Her chin was double, and she
Was thirty round the waist !
A quint of curious urchins
Tugged wildly at her dress . ..
He followed with the baby ;
I smiled, I will confess.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tim Bulletin would oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper-
super-script-ion for "copy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable, to be refused.
The contents of this paver are copyright by the pub-
lishers. The right to reproduce or translate any part of
the contents of this number is hereby expressly reserved by
the publishers.
The Editor ■will carefully read and, where practicable,
acknowledge in the “ Correspondence" column all contri-
butions submitted, whether in the form of Political,
Social, or other Articles, Verse, Short Tales or Sketches
(those dealing with Australian subjects, and not exceeding
twc columns in length, or, say, SOOO words, are specially
acceptable), Paragraphs. Betters, or newspaper Clippings.
All communications will be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
Tiik Buli.ktin will return all unsuitable MS. when the
address is specified and stamps are enclosed. But no
MS. will be ret urned, or preserved, unless these conditions
are observed. When MS. is forwarded without stamps
for return it will be understood that the copy is to be
destroyed if not acceptable. Personal applications for
return of MS. cannot receive attention, Tim Bulletin
desires, further, those sending MS. to distinctly under-
stand that it is not responsible for the preservation or
transmission of MS.
To Amateurs in Black and White.
Anyone, supplying to Tim Bulletin original humorous
or other topical drawings in line or wash, of sufficient
merit and interest and adapted for direct reproduction, or
any interesting photograph illustrative of a current event,
will be paid for same on acceptance. Any picture con-
taining a good idea, but unfitted for direct reproduction
— i.e., any picture which has to be re-drawn —will be paid
for as a suggestion only. The condition's under which
such artistic contributions will be received are those
applying to MS.

THE LIBERAL LOSSES AND THE
LABOR LESSON.
Australian “Liberals ” have discovered that one
of the things which did their cause infinite harm
during the late Federal election was the audacious
fashion in which “good party” deadbeats were
foisted by some central machine or authority on
constituencies which didn’t want them ; and the
papers are full of laments signed “Enraged,”
“Disgusted,” and so on. Certainly the writers’
annoyance is justified. Bowden, for example,
was a failure in the Australian Parliament, and
he lost kudos in the Nepean (N.S.W.)as a result.
Hence a powerful local movement was started
to oust him. A big proportion of the electors
were prepared to support Syd Smith or any
other old has-been, so long as they were
spared Bowden. But the N.S.W. Central
Executive, or League of Liberalism, which works
obscurely in a room underneath Pitt-street, had
told Bowden he should get the party nomination,
whether the bulk of those' concerned wanted him
or not; and a ukase to that effect went forth from
the cellar, and he got the nomination and was
duly defeated. It is Liberalism’s misfortune and
Labor’s fortune that the same crowd is running
State Liberalism fronmhe same cellar, and on the
same lines at the.present time. With the election
five months distant, and with Wade’s fight-
ing policy still an unknown quantity, one
“Akchdall Parkhill, ' sec.,” is issuing frantic
appeals through the press to Liberals in
Marrickville, North Sydney, Parramatta and
other districts to assemble and select candidates.
But a death-like coma is over his party just now.
Even the normally-active anti-Labor expert is too
dazed to feel up to attending Liberal rallies. The
prospect appeals to linn as little as bacon-fat to a
bad sailor in a gale at sea. This supplies the
chance of the party hacks —those “safe” non-
entities whom Wade and the people who toil in
the Pitt-street cellar want to have nominated.
With the rank and file of Liberals absent, the
selection of these people is as sure as their scorn-
ful rejection would be under other circumstances.
In a couple of months’ time Liberalism will
awake from its trance and start casting round for
the best candidates, only to find that the worst
have been chosen by the folks that toil in thePitt-
street cellar, and that they are as immovable as
Bowden was when the Fusion went to the
shambles.
* * * *
That is, of course, essentially Liberalism’s
funeral; but it affords a useful warning or Horri-
ble Example to Labor. The State Labor party
has its barnacles too. A lifetime in Opposition
and a transference of most of the party’s best
elements to the Federal Houses has afflicted
it with a number of useless old men. It
is doubtful if there is any party in the
Commonwealth to-day which is more in need of
an infusion of vigorous young blood. It has the
faults and weaknesses of old age. It lacks
courage, initiative and independence in a lament-
able degree. It is its custom to roar like an insane
dinosaur when there is absolutely nothing doing,
and like any sucking dove when an occasion arises
that really calls for the loud yell of protest. Its
backing and filling and all-round attitude of
spineless hesitancy have often afflicted would-be
supporters with the tired feeling. It has
all the short-sightedness of extreme old age. It
hasn’t been able to see that the State Frights cry
is a dead cry, that the afflictions-of-N.S.W. ticket
has outlived its usefulness, and that there is no
political money in backing up wire-netting steals
and other cantankerous attempts on the part of
anti-Labor Premiers to score off the Australian
Parliament.
* * * *
The State Laborites will do a lot of good for
themselves if they grasp the fact that the amazing
vote which was given to the Federal Labor party
was to a large extent a tribute to personalities in
that party. Fisher, knowingly or otherwise,
never played a wiser game than when he stood
out against the clamorous demand of his oppo-
nents that he should “save himself ” by giving
England a Dreadnought it didn’t want, and which
Australia could ill afford to buy. On that occa-
sion a politician might reasonably have suspected
that the people really did want a Dreadnought
donated. The press-noise was so deafening that it
was hard to believe there was little or nothing to
justify it. EvenDEAKiN, whoisfairlyskilfulatdiag-
nosing public opinion, was deceived. Not till the
Dreadnought subscription-list was opened and the
people were given an opportunity to express their
opinion of Dreadnausea in terms of hard cash, did
the public appreciate what a grotesque misrepre-
sentation it was to say that Australia was enthusi-
astic over the proposition. Theepisode cost Fisher
office ; but it won him support throughout Aus-
tralia. It indicated to the Commonwealth that
he had the perceptiveness that the statesman
needs, as well as the grit to withstand Jingo
abuse and newspaper clamor. How would the
average N.S.W. State Laborite have borne him-
self in a crisis like that? This paper hardly likes
to think about it.
* * * *
The N.S.W. Labor party, as at present consti-
tuted, suggests, in many respects, a sort of semi-
democratic Geebung—an anomalous oldster who
is a frothy “loyalist’’ of the flag-wagging
order, a passionate mourner over the alleg-
edly filched “rights” of N.S.W., an anti-
defenceite, an assailant of the Commonwealth
Parliament on about 750 different grounds;
and yet a battler for decent wages and humani-
tarian legislation. A weird figure, and one that
it is hard to take seriously. The party is what it
is by reason of the Tory, stagnant-minded men
who are in it, and w'ho, to an extent, dominate it
—the B. Smiths and Fairbairns of the local
democratic movement. Already there are evi-
dences that the “ bosses ” of the Central League
—tlieSydney Labor body which corresponds to that
which toils for Liberalism in the cellar in Pitt-street
—are disposed wherever possible to load these old
hands on to the constituencies, regardless of the
latter’s desires in the matter. Wherever that
sort of thing is successful Labor is in for trouble.
Country and suburban electorates resent city
dictation. Either they know the man they want
and mean to have him, or they know the man
the city league wants them to have, and are
resolved to turn him down. Only by free and
untrammelled local selections, made within
reasonable proximity to polling-day by thoroughly
representative local Labor bodies, and carried
out with little or no regard to the long-past ser-
vices of aspirants, 'will the party be in the sound
position of achieving the sort of candidates which
Liberalism failed to get last April.
“MERELY MARY”-WITH IMPROVE
MENTS.
“Merely Mary,” always a problem, lias, it
seems, lately become more of a problem than
ever throughout Australia. The splendid pros-
perity of the country has worked two ways: it
has increased the demand and at the same time
limited the supply. It is not only that there are
people who, with one “domestic help” before,
think now chat things will run to two, while
others who once pulled through without any at
all reckon that their bettered circumstances
demand at least a “young girl to assist.” That
of course increases the demand. But exactly the
same cause produces two results which directly
limit the supply ; in the first place, the country’s
prosperity has materially increased the marriage
rate; and in the second place, the prosperity
which makes Toorak and Barling Point think
they want an extra maid also makes Carlton and
Redfern think that Mary might as well stay
home for a bit. Even more important perhaps is
the failure of the supply from the country. A
12 bushel harvest and wheat at 4s. have either
called many a country girl back to her home or
kept many a girl there who otherwise would have
been encouraged to come down to “a place m
the city.” After ail, there is a very cheerful
silver lining to the dark cloud that hangs over ten
thousand harassed Australian households.
Yet there still are plenty of girls and women
available for the work. The trouble is they will
not take it. The city girl especially will prefer
almost any other brand of toil. Even the “factory
hand ’’ will toss her head at the “slavey,” and the
typewriter and the shop miss and the waitress put
themselves in another class altogether. It is
a greilt misfortune, for there is not another
occupation which is a better training for woman’s
real work in life—the management of a house of
her own. This hostile attitude may be due to
the girls themselves, but it is a good deal more
likely to be due to other people. Many a mother
would not have a word to say if she were told
that her son was going to marry a typist; but she
would wonder what was coming over the boy if
he proposed to marry a housemaid. As for a
nurse, a doctor of the highest standing may marry
her and Society will receive her without a qualm.
But if the same man married his cook, or even a
housekeeper of equally unquestionable morals,
the same Society would drop another lump of
sugar in its tea and say it was very shocking.
Yet the chances are that the housemaid
would make the dear boy a much better
wife than the typist, who in three cases
out of four . won’t know whether you boil
cabbage or grill it; and, though nobody wants
to say a word against the great value of the
nurse’s services, the cook’s and the housekeeper’s
are, at least, as important, and their training for
the charge of a household is on the whole pro-
bably far better.
That “ Merely Maky” often commits assault
and battery on the English language is a fact; and
her mother rqay drink. But it isn’t so sur-
prising that so many answer this description as it
is that there are so very many who don’t. Con-
sidering the social status which, hitherto, has been
assigned to the domestic servant, the really sur-
prising thing is that so many well-educated girls
have taken up this class of work. It certainly is
not the work itself that thousands of others object
to. Put some other brand upon them, and they
will do it willingly. Some months ago a man
in one of the cities advertised for a companion for
his daughter. Something over 250 replies came
in, mostly from young women who said that, if
they could only get such a place, they would be
quite prepared to share in the work of the house-
hold. But while one advt. of that kind could
produce 250 applications, it takes nearer 250
advts. for a plain general servant to produce one
application. It isn’t the work, then, but the
status which has been assigned to this particular
worker that causes most of the trouble from
which ten thousand Australian households are
said to be suffering. And it is desirable that the
status should be raised, not merely in order
to relieve the ten thousand households of
their troubles, but because it would give
an opening for the profitable employment of
a great deal of labor which is now either wasted
altogether or turned into undesirable channels.
For not only, as said before, is domestic labor the
very best training for a woman’s real work in life,
while prolonged shop or office labor is about the
very worst, but this crowding of women into
shops and offices and factories is playing the mis-
chief with the earnings of men. If, then, the
women can be got out of the offices, and to some
extent out of the shops and factories, and can be
encouraged to go back to domestic work, it will
be a step of national importance; it will make
them fitter for housekeeping duties, it will im-
prove the outlook for the crowded-out male, and
incidentally it will remove one of the troubles
which unquestionably discourage the birth-rate —
the scarcity of domestic help.
* * * *
It is not a question of money ; for, taken as a
whole, domestic service is the best-paid service in
which any large body of women engage. It is a
question rather of the attitude adopted towards
the domestic helper, and of the social status
assigned to her. , That those who will take up an
improved attitude will meet with many dis-
couragements is. very likely. The old style of
“ Merely Maby” is hardly likely to appreciate
such things. The old style of “ Merely Maky”
would, however, almost entirely disappear, just
as the old style of Sairey Gamp has disappeared
before the modern nurse. But there is this
difference: with regard to domestic help the
certification of maids isn’t needed so much as the
certification of mistresses. There must be hun-
dreds of housekeepers who are quite prepared to
treat their maids as well as they do their nurses.
The trouble is to find them. It is an age of
leagues and societies ; but there may be room for
one more—a society of housewives who will
pledge themselves to promote, in their own
homes and elsewhere, a more reasonable attitude
towards that class of female workers who, next to
the housewives themselves, are rendering the
best service to the community.
CONCERNING AN UTTERLY USELESS
OFFICIAL.
Those who advocate the abolition of the absurd
office of State Governor want no sounder argu-
ment than is afforded by a consideration of the
duties which that Personage performs during any
given week. Here, according to the ‘‘Court Cir-
cular” officially supplied to the press, was how
Lord Chelmsford earned his money in N.S.
Wales for the week ending Saturday, May 7 :
His Excellency and Lady Chelmsford will be present
at the University commemoration at tlie Town Hall this
[Saturday] morning.
on Tuesday evening next the. Governor, who will be
accompanied by Lady GHELMsford, Will preside at the
annual meeting ot the Sydney Rescue Work Society at
the Y.M.C.A. Hall.
On Wednesday afternoon Lady Chelmsford will open a
sale of work in connection with the -Congregational
Church, M'irrickville. In the evening His Excellency
and Lady Chelmsford will be present at the Masonic
concert in the Tow n Hall.
On Thursday afternoon Lady Chelmsford is to preside
at a meeting of the National Council of Women: and in
the evening His Excellency and Lady Chelmsford will be
present at the Stage Society’s performance of “The
Cassilis Engagement.”
The Governor is to open the Hawkesbury Agricultural
Show at Clarendon on Friday. Lady Chelmsford will
accompany His Excellency to this function.
On Saturday next His Excellency and Lady Chelms-
ford will attend the matinee performance at the Criterion
Theatre, in aid of the Hospital Saturday fund.
Thus, for attending, in seven days, four theatrical
entertainments, a sale of work, a Rescue Society
meeting, an agricultural show and a University
commemoration, the demented State paid a total
stranger £lOO, and also housed him and
franked him over its railways. The theory of
those who favor the maintenance of this idiotic
arrangement is that it tends, in some vague, un-
explained fashion, to keep the tie of Empire
from bursting. Those who exploit this conten-
tion most busily never come down to details and
explain just how the attendance of an imported
Briton at a dog-show is going to check
the cataclysm which Bruce Smith lives
to avert. They never even attempt to. They
just drive straight ahead with their emaciated old
“ argument,” and at anyone who interrupts or pro-
tests they heave the soul-satisfying rebuke, ‘‘Dis-
loyalist.”
The monarchical business, no less than the sham
monarchical business of which samples exist in
every State of the Commonwealth, needs to he
considered from a business point of view. And
that is how the live nations always have con-
sidered it. In France the monarchy didn’t pay the
State, and so the people, when they got the sense
which accompanies a certain degree of education,
uprose and threw their Royal Family out. In Bri-
tain the monarchy, as an institution, lias mostly
paid. At present, as one of the English reviews
pointed out last month, it pays remarkably well.
The Crown lands, which were handed over to the
nation in exchange for the Civil List, return at
the present time almost as much as the nation
allows to the whole of its Royal Family. With
values steadily rising, the United Kingdom will
shortly be in the comfortable position not of pay-
ing, but of being paid by its sovereigns. And the
public is all the more willing to continue the
system because, while it costs little or nothing, it
has an occasional habit of turning out very well.
At the finish of the Boer war Britain was the
worst-hated country on earth. It is impossible
to overstate the influence, since then, of Ed. Vll.’s,
ingratiating ways on foreign rulers and their
Ministers, as a result of which the Lion’s tail has
not been twisted for months past; and the animal
has become almost popular in the European
chancelleries.
* * * *
State Governors do no service of this sort. They
couldn’t by their influence settle a dispute in a
Little Bethel, and in a Dill-Moran shindy
their interference, if it were noticed, would be re-
sented. They make speeches, but, in the nature
of things, their remarks are non-committal, plati-
tudinous, as empty and valueless as an Empire
Day oration. They are supposed to have two sets
of duties—the constitutional and the social. For
their constitutional duties they mostly have no
training whatever ; any District or County Court
Judge is a more competent man for the job.
The Chief Justice could invariably do it
better. Their social duty consists of enter-
taining at long intervals large concourses of
well-to-do people at tea, and at shorter
intervals much smaller concourses of much better-
to-do people at dinner. This part of a Governor’s
job is totally unnecessary; yet, even if it were
necessary, a Chief Justice could do it just as well,
also. It is from many points of view, no doubt,
undesirable that he should do it; for the less a
Chief Justice or any other Judge is mixed up
with “society’’ the better. But, as before re-
marked, this part of the business could be cut
out altogether, because it is totally unnecessary—
as unnecessary, for instance, as it is for, say, the
general manager of the Bank of New South Wales
to give away teas and dinners in his official
capacity. There remains, then, only the micrps-
copio constitutional duties; and if a Chief
Justice can’t be trusted to perform them, he
can’t be trusted to do the other work which he is
called upon to do every working day of his life.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The “No Danger” Advocate.
Colonel Foster, R.E., told the N.S.W. Public
Service Association last week that he had
often read with disgust what had been written about
the danger to Australia. The real truth was that no
Power would be able to concentrate a sufficient force
upon Australia to successfully attack it if engaged in a
war with the British Empire. After all, it would be a
mere episode, and although no doubt Australia would
put out its whole strength to meet it, we should only
have to meet a force that an enemy could spare while it
was engaged against the Empire.
It is the entire local argument for anti-defence
in a concentrated form ; and coming from
one who is a soldier and who has been ex-
pressly engaged to teach military tactics at
Sydney University, the pronouncement carries
weight. There are circumstances, however, which
tend to discount it. Colonel Foster belongs
notoriously to the “ Manchester school ” of politi-
cal thought. In Cobden’s time, people of this
way of thinking believed implicitly that if Eng-
land instituted Freetrade, the other nations,
eager for industrial as for every other form of
peace, would follow suit. They favored disarma-
ment, arguing that if one nation started to
disarm, the others would be so edified that they
would do likewise, tio England dropped the Pro-
tection which had made her great, and also
adopted voluntary inditary and naval service.
But Cobden died with tariff walls rising on
all sides, to the detriment of the de-
mented country which had believed his
prophecies, and with the big foreign battalions
steadily growing. His political heirs have, never-
theless, clung with pathetic fidelity to the old gags.
The hardshell Freetrader of modern t.tnes is
invariably a sinall-navy advocate, and a volun-
teer-cum-Boy-Seouts army man. He is incapable
of suspecting his enemy of evil intent no
matter bow the latter’s battleships and army
corps multiply. Studied offensiveness, in a
potential foe, lie regards as a quaint, harm-
less mannerism. Ex-Prime Minister Rose-
bery, who, if be is anything definite, is
a CoBDKN-ite, typified the Manchester thinker’s
attitude when, in face of serious trouble, he
supposed England would “muddle through some-
how.” The anti-universal service man always
does weigh in with some futile aspiration of that
sort when, largely as a result of assurances that
there is absolutely no danger anywhere, the
nation has drifted to the brink of ruin. Hap-
pily the present Australian Government doesn’t
believe m leaving defence to chance and
the goodwill of the other fellow, any more
than it believes in leaving its, industries
to those perilous things. It has declared
for compulsory service and an adequate local
navy, for the same sound reason that it has
declared for a tariff and other measures which are
antipathetic to'the Foster school. It is uncon-
vinced by the argument that no Power which was
engaged with Britain would be able to damage
Australia; for it knows that if Australia were
assailed it would not necessarily he by a nation
which was also fighting Britain. It is more pro-
bable that that occasion would he seized for an
assault by some other Power—say Japan or an
awakened China. So the argument that no Power
which was fighting Britain could also tight Aus-
tralia falls helplessly to the ground. At present
this country, with its absurd railway system and
its few and indifferently-trained soldiers and its
one old ruined gunboat, is as little capable of
repelling an invading force of disciplined Mongols
as the wretched Koreaus were a decade ago.
And, despite all the earnest and well-meant
advice of imported British officers, that is a state
of things it means to alter.
The Fat and the Lean.
The working-man, up against a law which he
doesn’t like, either hows his head to it or frankly
hits it in the eye. He usually knows no other
way. Every day of his life he is shifting things
by the force of his muscles. And when, meeting
with a law which he doesn’t like, he hits it in the
eye, what a monster he is ! Outraged Lawnorder
gets hoarse denouncing him. Then it drops him
into gaol for a month or a year or two years, and
says it’s a pity lie didn’t get life—defying the law
like that ! That is the working-man’s way. Now
take the Fat man’s way. He isn’t used to shifting
obstacles by the force of his muscles. Where the
other man uses brawn he uses brain ; where one
butts in frankly, the other proceeds by cunning—
"sterling business capacity,” it is sometimes
called. ISo when the law says that he, being a
candidate for Parliament, shall spend only a
hundred pounds, does he either bow hi» head or


hit the thing frankly in the eye? Not much !
But he defeats it all the same. He wants a lot
of advertising space; he wants his speeches
printed and circulated ; he wants his virtues
trumpeted. Does he go to a newspaper or a
printing office and give an order for so many
inches of ink-splashes, and include the bill in his
£100? Not quite! Hesays, “I’llstarta newspaper.
Oh, yes, quite as an investment. Ain’t I allowed
to invest my money in a newspaper if I want to?”
So the Prattler, or the Patriot, or something
such suddenly appears. It may contain a recipe
for making tomato soup, and hint obscurely at the
remarkable cleansing properties of soap; but
nine-tenths of it consists of the election literature
of the Fatman who has founded it—“as an in-
vestment, I assure you.” Sometimes he gets a
business concern over which he has some pull to
pay him something for an advt. ; but he doesn’t
always bother about that. After the elections
he decides that it wasn’t as profitable an
investment as he was told it would be •
and it drops. Of course it drops. He
always intended that it should drop. But the
bill doesn’t go in with election expenses. Cer-
tainly not; it was one of his “investments.”
And Lawnorder isn’t outraged, and if it gets
hoarse it is through laughing at the clever way in
which its friend the Fatman made ducks and
drakes of an Act that it didn’t pay him to obey.
And, of course, nobody at all goes to gaol. Gaols
are not for Fat gentlemen—it is much easier for a
Fat man to pass through the eye of a needle than
to enter prison.

The Independence of Members of
Parliament.
For years it has been the custom of the Tory
press to gibe at Labor members as men who were
not independent, who dared not express their own
ideas on any subject, but were bound hand and
tongue by their masters, the men who run the
Labor Leagues. It was hammered in persistently
that legislation from such men must be necessarily
bad, as no self-respecting man would be a mem-
ber of Parliament on such degrading terms. But
the disaster of April 13 produced a mental as well
as a political revolution, and the daily press sees
things in a new light. So it proposes to adopt
what it used to describe as “the nefarious methods
of Labor.” In Sydney it is demanding that
Liberal Leagues shall be started all over the
country where they do not already exist, in time
to choose candidates for the butchery in Sep-
tember. These leagues are to be supreme
over candidates and everybody else, and
they are to elect delegates to form a
central executive on the lines of the
Political Labor League. But the executive is
not to interfere with the local leagues, unless re-
quested to do so. And, most beautiful of all,
these leagues are warned against the danger of
falling too much under the influence of the
sitting member; and, where that gentleman does
not suit the local league, he is to be fired out
without compunction. “It is important to
emphasise this, because the politicians have
hitherto been rather more powerful in the party
than was good for it,” was the way one of them
hammered home the argument that the politician
must be taught that his billet depends upon the
way he carries out the ideas of his league. In
fact, the new idea is that the member of Parlia-
ment shall be merely the State mouthpiece
of the Liberal League, having no opinions or
ideas of his own. Whether these papers expect
to get self-respecting men to become candidates
under such conditions is not left in doubt. They
do expect it. So, apparently, their objection in
the past was not to Labor members being under
outside domination, but to the domination not
being in accord with the daily papers’ ideas. As
a matter of fact the proposal goes much farther
in the direction of destroying a member’s inde-
pendence than the Labor system does. Every
Labor member is also a member of the league,
and takes part in its deliberations. Theoretically,
he has as much say as anyone else ; practically,
as he is the man who has to do the fighting, he
has more, for his words carry weight. The party’s
objective is not new, it is now almost classic; and
the trouble is not what is wanted, but the best
way to obtain it. If the Labor memberfinds that
the majority of his party is against him in regard
to methods, he naturally sinks his own opinion in
deference to majority rule. The Liberal crowd, on
the other hand, has no single, universal “objec-
tive.” Therefore the Liberal member is to be
under the control of his league, not merely as to
methods, but as to policy. Even as to methods
the Labor member is not bound irrevocably by
the decisions of his conference; but the new
Liberal regime is to provide that the members on
that side shall be entirely under the heel of little
district leagues, which will be ruled absolutely,
in the nature of things, by petty-minded social
tyrants in skirts. It is a humorous spectacle this
of press hypocrites who have for years denounced
the Labor method, taking to something 10 times
more drastic and infinitely more calculated to
“sap the member’s independence.”
«.
The Referendum.
The two referendums went the right way the
other day; but if they hadn’t done so it wouldn’t
have been anything to be very surprised about.
There was absolutely nothing on either voting
paper to bring to the mind of the average man
the facts or problems about which he was asked
to express an opinion. One question was as to
the Financial Agreement; the other as to the
Transfer of Debts. But neither of those things
was mentioned on the papers. The bald, un-
enlightening title of each bill was mentioned ;
and as the title of one might just as
well have been the title of the other,
the newspapers were driven to screech to
their flocks—“ Vote Yes” (or No, as the case
might be) “on the blue paper,” and so-and-so on
the buff. Something was obviously wrong when
the electors could only be relied upon to tell which
was which by the color of the paper. There
could have been no sane objection to the putting
of the simple question—“ Are you in favor of the
transfer of the State debts to the Common-
wealth?” Certainly as to many matters the
Government, being a partisan body interested iu
getting a particular answer, might not be fit or
worthy to be trusted with the framing of the
question ; for nothing is easier than to give a
partisan kink to a question. But that difficulty
could be got over by putting upon the High Court
the duty of framing every question that the Par-
liament may decide to submit to the people. The
High Court would simply have to take the Act
providing for the referendum, and, with the
country s best judicial mind, frame a question in
such a way as to elicit the truest expression of
opinion from the electors. The referendum is
really an appeal over the heads of the Parliament
to the people ; it is a question to the highest court
in the land; and the proper body to “state a
case to that highest court is the High Court,
which is a body of men trained to the special work
of stating cases. But certainly, whether the High
Court has this further responsibility cast upon it
or not, the system lately adopted should be
altered. To have to “ fix ” the question by
naming the color of the paper it is printed on is
too grotesque altogether.
A Faint Heart and No Fish.
When Allen Taylor began his present term of
office as Mayor of Sydney lie had almost made up
his mind to take a straight dive into the waters of
Socialism, and bring out of its depths a muni-
cipal fish service. He even got as far as
to strip off the clothes of prejudice and
stand unashamed before scandalised Private
Enterprise. Having harangued Private Enter-
prise from the banks in several long speeches,
the diver turned and faced the pool for his header.
And then arose the old trouble of a faint heart.
He began to wonder whether the water wasn’t too
cold after all. He hadn’t shivered more than once
before Private Enterprise, which had been seized
with palpitation of the heart, recovered suffi-
ciently to take an interest in the diver’s wel-
fare, and to vociferate that if he didn’t want
to catch his death of cold he had better
climb back into his old clothes. This so incensed
the diver that he nearly jell into the pool. But
he just managed to recover himself. Private
Enterprise was, however, satisfied. “Yah!” it
sneered, “ you are not game ! You are too fat,
and your heart won’t stand it. Your mind is
made up, but your feet won’t let you !” At this the
diver became more incensed than ever, and he put
his big toe into the water. And the water nearly
froze him to death ! Nevertheless, he wouldn’t
crawl out just then; he reckoned the crowd
would go away presently, whereupon he could
slip out and go back as if nothing had happened.
Meanwhile, lie made further harangues about the
fish business. He declared that of all the
conscience-starved robbers, the fish agents in Syd-
ney took the gold medal. They not only robbed
the fish-catcher, but they robbed the consumer.
In fact, they robbed everybody but themselves.
So Samson the diver cried out vigorously for
everybody to stand from under while he got a
grip of the pillars of the agents’ business. By
this time he had got two toes into the cold water.
He had asked the fishermen to send along their
catches to the Council’s fish market at Woolloo-
mooloo, and had despatched an officer round the
rivers and fishing stations to assure the men that
they would get from the City Council what they
had never received from the private agents—
honesty in regard to market prices, a square deal
in regard to commission, and prompt settlement.
“ But,” said the fishermen, “ what’s the good of it
all ? There is no sale for fish in Sydney. The
public doesn’t want fish.” Inhis mostearnest voice
the diver assured them that ali that was necessary
was to break down the ring which maintained the
high prices, and the public would rush the article.
This appealed to the harassed fish-catchers, and
for a little while they sent along some supplies.
But the diver began "to freeze again, and, instead
of taking a header straight in, he said that, after
all, the time was not quite ripe—nothing could be
done effectively until the new city fish markets
were ready. So he dried his toe on his mayoral
robes and went round to widen -a few streets to
the benefit always of Propputy and sometimes of
the Public. Then for a long time there was silence
concerning the “cheap, good and plentiful
supply of fish.” Occasionally one inhabitant,
or perhaps two inhabitants, would ask the
polite Dago in liis shop when the price
of fish was coming down sufficiently to
allow persons with a family of three or four to
obtain a meal under Bs. (id. ; to which the Dago
would reply : “You wanta da feesh cheap? You
malta me laugh. Aska da Lodm’r ? He maka de
laugh.” Meanwhile, the private agents had been
getting busy. Old differences between them were
settled, and they combined to raise obstacles along
the track which the diver must take to get back
to the diving place. They have thus got
his supplies very nearly cut off, and feel
satisfied with the strength of their position.
The new markets will probably open at the begin-
ning of July, and it is possible that, in addition
to acting as selling agents, the council will run a
few retail fish shops there. But, even supposing
the council can obtain sufficient supplies to stock
them—which is very doubtful, owing to the sus-
picions that have grown upon the fishermen since
nothing came of the early whoops—the benefit
will be circumscribed. Sydney in seven-eighths
of its bulk will not get any cheaper fish, nor any
better fish. Nothing will give Sydney the cheap
and wholesome fish food that is kept from it but a
whole-hog municipal service, which will include
depdts everywhere, and even transport of supplies
to the consumer’s door. Like every other sane
system that is based on putting an end to the
deprivation or exploitation of the public, this will
come in time. But that that time will be Allen
Taylor’s time is doubtful.

Concerning Tips—and a Chance Lost.
The award of Justice Higgins in the Arbi-
tration Court matter of the ship stewards,
while possibly the best compromise his Honor
could make, nevertheless falls lamentably short
of what it might have been in one par-
ticular. Though pantrymen, barmen, store-
keepers and stewards of. various glades were
parties to the plaint, the chief persons concerned
were “stewards of first grade”—the common or
handy stewards—who asked, among otner things,
that their wages be raised from £5 to £8 a month.
Numbers of the “other things” were refused;
but his Honor raised the wages from £5 to £5105.,
with corresponding increases in other grades.
Mr. Higgins first laid down 425. per wee'., as the
basic minimum wage of an unskilled laborer.
Then he declared that stewarding was moder-
ately skilled labor; and next he took
into account all the sources of the employee’s
income. Wages he fixed at £5 10s. per month;
board and lodging he considered worth £2 ss. ;
and tips he reckoned to be worth £2 per month
on a general average, thus bringing the total to
£9 15s. per month, or about £2 ss. 6d. per week.
Stewards’ wages on cargo boats and colliers he
fixed at £lO per month, because of the more
strenuous toil, the longer hours and the absence
of tips. It was a fairish award, and it seems to
have been moderately satisfactory to both parties
—and yet it leaves a lot to be desired. It takes
no account of the large commissions that some
stewards get, while others get none at all; and,
in the matter of tips, it hits the stewards on
trifling little tubs, such as those running to Tas-
mania’s West Coast, to the Gippsland Lakes, and
so forth. Their tips don’t reach £2 a year, yet
they are to get the same wages as the others. As a
matter of fact, the plea of the stewards—that tips
ought to be abolished and should be ignored in
making the award—was the correct attitude.
Unfortunately, the Arbitration Court saw noway
to enforce such a rule. Mr. Higgins’ view of the
position was that the shipowners charged certain
fares to their customers, and paid certain wages to
their employees, on the tacit understanding that
those fares should be raised by the customers
themselves handing sums equal to £2 per month
per man to the employees direct, instead of paying
that amount as an addition to the fare charged,
and letting the employer pay it out as wages on
an impartial system. Several stewards gave their
individual assurance that if wages were raised to
the proposed scale they would refuse to
accept tips ; but his Honor found him-
self unable to accept this assurance in
the absence of a general guarantee. Yet
if he had raised the wages, the employers—who
are combined—might have found it possible to
raise fares all round slightly, and, by way of making
a return to their customers, they might have
caused an almost absolute cessation of tips. The
whole tip business is vicious, not to say immoral
;.:id insidious —having got a foothold on the boats,
it threatens to spread to the radways and similar
services. Yet these boats are a thing of them-
selves, . distinct, apart; both the parties to the
claim are organised and united ; and there was
a unique chance to end the whole nefarious
business. Apparently Mr. Higgins wasn’t ener-
getic enough to grab the chance, and thus enforce
the reform. Instead of that, he legalised the
system, and therein did more harm than he
probably knew.

Certain Frost-bitten Remarks of William
Irvine.
Although the Victorian press has ceased to dis-
cuss the upheaval of the 13th, and is trying to
forget the unfortunate affair, here and there a
stray politician is lifting up his voice and making
more or less interesting comments. Amongst
these wanderers is William Irvine, who himself
only retained his seat by the slenderest of
majorities. Discussing the debacle itself, the Ice-
berg, looking for the reason, put his finger exactly
on the spot:—
The thing which gave force and vitality to the Labor
platform was the conception that the election of the
party meant the opening up of a new era of totally
changed social conditions, in which the working man
would obtain the full fruits of his labor, hitherto held
back by the machinations of those who were termed
capitalists.
But, he continued, with a thoroughly Arctic flavor
in his voice,—
This was a palpable fallacy. It would soon be found
that the Labor party would be unable to alter in any
marked degree the rewards which either skilled or
unskilled labor was able to obtain.
Yet, during William the Frozen’s residence in
Melbourne, he has seen this allegedly impossible
thing happening. He has seen, by reason of the
Factories Acts and Wages Boards, “ the rewards
of labor” steadily raised, the conditions iim
proved, and the hours of labor lessened. Only
recently he has seen labor obtain a regular half-
holiday, with no reduction in pay. A few weeks
ago the Factories Act was stretched to include
grocery and drapery employees, whose wages
were promptly raised. They were raised so
materially that Fat became alarmed, and for a
few days threatened to raise prices at the same
time. After all, the theory that William the
Frost-bitten announced is as old as sin. It is only
a variation of the ancient Tory gag that the
“ wage fund ” is an arbitrary amount, unalterable
by legislation. Practically, said the ancient Fat
Man, it is the will of Goi), and the worker must put
up with it. No details were ever given as to how
the amount was arrived at; and no specific reason
was advanced why the capitalist and the em-
ployers generally should Wax fat, while the
laborer should be content with his crust. But
Fat said that it was an “economic axiom,” like-,
wise the will of Goo ; and Fat not only said this in
a very convincing tone, but he also took all sorts of
cat etosee that thingscamehis way. Now, however,
labor is beginning to have a say in the matter, and
is endeavoring to arrange a more equitable distri-
bution of the results of its efforts. And, despite
the high-and-mighty dictum of Irvine the Cold,
it is likely to go oil being considerably successful.
Thief-Catching and Its Drawbacks.
The yarn of an inveterate pressman :
In the past, almost any old kind of individual has
been good enough for a policeman ; and if the job had
been hereditary there could hardly have been lt-ss change
in the stamp of the men and their methods. Instead of
the detective force being a highly-paid profession,
attracting keen intellects and calculating intel-
ligences, it has in Australia continued to be a
low-waged, hard-grafting, miserable-conditioned - and
dangerous trade, that offers nothing to the
clever man excepting a warning to keep out of it.
As to the ordinary policeman, physically he is a high-
class specimen ; as a brain, the majority of him is a sixth-
rate sample, even though he is a cut above the average
of intelligence in the over-rated London Metropolitan
police. The highest qualification of an officer should be
his ability t.o prevent crime ; and, with a more
intelligent force, there would be a diminished
sheet and a tremendous saving to the public thereby.
But what is the outlook for securing such a force? Is
there one Uovernmenb in Australia moulding the re-
quired criminal investigation reform? Notope! lteform
is all the rage, especially now when the old tight barnacle
gangs are fighting in the last ditch. Prison reform is a
mani . But the police—fid. a week on to their pay, and
there's your reform ! It’s like the British workman who,
having glazed a panel to represent cedar, and being
requested to change the order and make it mahogany,
turned what he called the “ twiddles ” upside down aiid
shied an egg at it.
In every department of life Truth cries at the top of
its voice :“ It pays to buy brains.” Even the criminal
bows to the newer need. The up-to-date eiiminal
absorbs scientific and all expert knowledge like a univer-
sity professor. He doesn’t allow alcohol to cloud his
br.iin-appuratus. He carefully chooses his collaborators.
And he would about as soon have an average policeman
with him on a ticklish “ lay ” as he would have a Pata-
gonian. Yet the country gets good value for its money.
The trouble is that it doesn’t offer money enough. It
offers just enough to buy brawn; and if in addition it
gets brains, it is so much to the good on the deal. But
the bargain is quite an accident.
As an instance of the great inducements held out to
the smart man not to qualify as an expert thief-catcher,
a current disturbance in the N.S.VV. detective branch
is worth attention. The trouble centres round
the refusal of the Inspector-General to recom-
mend the expenditure of a few extra pounds a week
as “ lodging money.” When Fosbbry was Inspector-
General the “demons” under him were allowed out-of-
pocket expenses (up to a reasonable amount) for meals,
and the system was continued by Garvin up to the time
of the tram strike. When that had fizzled out, Garvin
counted up the meal expenses that had accumulated
owing to the long hours of duty demanded by
him from his force, and he decided that the
time was ripe for turning a frozen eye that way. He
just thought the same old single thought that heads of
Departments and bosses generally keep handy when they
want to cut expenses—pinch the men a bit. So the
thief-catchers were pinched for their tea money or break-
fast money, in order, presumably, that the General’s
financial report to the Minister might be pleasant read-
ing. Garvin’s argument was that, after all, the detectives
were Civil servants, and, like the great number of other
Civil servants who could not get home, say, for lunch
they should pay for their meals in town. But the clerical
Civil servant doesn’t have to sit on the wharf waiting for
a steamer which, expected at daylight, does not arrive
until 10 o’clock or later ; the thief-catching Civil servant
does it often. The clerical Civil servant doesn’t
“ shadow ” a suspect all day and night without getting
a chance to grab even a hot pie ; the thief-catching Civil
servant wears out several pairs of boots a year at it. The
clerical Civil servant doesn’t have to face temptation to
“ go dead,” or get paralysis of the tongue or stiffening of
the memory—temptation that would keep him in hot pies
for a very long time. The thief-catching civil servant faces
it more times than is good for him, although it must be
said to the credit of the N.S.W. detectives that almost
all of them would rather go hungry all the time than go
wrong once. Apart from their honesty, they know that,
directly a “crook” squares them, the squaring business
must go on until they are bound to the “jemmies"
of half the “crooks” in the game. When the
detectives made an appeal to the Inspector-Gene-
ral to sanction a lodging allowance of 2s. per
man per day, instead of the standing allowance of Is.
per day, the “ General” might have weighed those things,
in order, if for no other reason, to keep satisfied the best
detective force south of the line. But he didn't.
“There’s no reason to go short of a meal on duty,’’ said
he; “you can always carry something with you!” So
the thief-catcher, when he is waiting for the winter
morning to lift a bit in order that he may have a look for
the expected steamer that conveys his prey, has three
choices. He can : (1) Remain at his post and closeout the
demands of his hunger on a cold sausage and crust of
bread carried in the pocket where his revolver reposes; (2)
remain at his post and go hungry ; (3) leave his post and
slip home to a warm breakfast, and a sight of his family.
The third choice is the natural inclination, and natural
inclination is generally a sure horse to back. In the
event of natural inclination winning, there is about
equal odds that the traveller will arrive; and prance
ashore without a delegate of Garvin’s to weloome him.
Which spells bad business for Garvin, leaving the public
out of the question.
A first-class detective in Sydney is paid 11s. 6d. a day,
plus Is. a day “lodging allowance”; a first-class con-
stable in Melbourne doing detective work is paid 16s. a
day in salary and allowances. At least one detective
in Melbourne is paid 18s. a day (salary and allowances)
seven days a week, which is 3s. fid. a day better than a
sub-inspector in the N.S.W. force. The allowances to
the Melbourne detectives run from Is. 6d. to ss. 6d. a
day more than those in Sydney ; in Maoriland the allow-
ance is Is. fid. or 25., according to rank. Taken all round,
the N.S.W. Department, while reaping a few pounds, has
sown a crop of dissatisfaction. The men knew they were
poorly treated before ; and they reckon they are worse
treated now.
The watchman of the criminal field should be more
fairly, not to say generously, dealt with. He should be
treated and remunerated as an expert and a highly-
trusted public servant. At present he is neither treated
nor remunerated as one or the other, and the wonder is
that he is half as good and reliable as he is.
“ Clarence O’Hag.vn”: I suppose the Labor
party may now be considered to have grown out
of the dirt-money stage. It begins to look like it.
But, still, the chief trouble before Fisher and his
men is a coy and shrinking timidity in approach-
ing certain issues which need courageous hand-
ling. Their daily prayer should be that their
promised greatness of achievement may not fail
through craven fear of being great. Already, if
the Sydney daily press may be believed, the
question of a referendum on the Federal capital
site is to be burked, or shelved, or just let slide.
Signs of a disquieting affability towards the old
State Frights and State Insects are floating about
in a queer way ; whether they are trustworthy, or
the reverse, remains to be seen. Anyway, I would
remind Fisher that too much affability has proved
fatal to one Prime Minister, and there is no war-
ranty that the thing isn’t still dangerous. When
the Sydney daily papers praise Fisher and his Cab-
inet for its “moderation,” and remark that “it has
made a good beginning—that is to say, a reassur-
ing beginning”—it is time to look round and see
who is tying up the horse while they pat it. I
suspect William Hughes (with an out-sized
suspicion) where the perpetuation of the Canberra-
site job is concerned. He—a democrat!—is
hostile to an appeal to the democracy, and is pro-
bably trying to persuade Fisher that “the time
is not ripe,” or “opportune,” or something, “to
re-open tlm matter.” If Fisher says he will (as
he should) give the people the opportunity of
choosing their own capital site, he will occupy an
impregnable position. His own party cannot
oppose it, as the referendum is a prominent and
invaluable plank hi Labor’s platform, while the
other side, the Oppofusion, dare not, as its
only hope of a return to office is to pose as
being more democratic than Labor itself. Wade,
of course, will object strenuously; but, then, who
is Wade, anyhow ? He wasn’t much before the
elections, and he has shrunk a terrible lot since,
along with the “power” of the alleged great
dailies of N.S.W.
After a long stretch of silence on the part of
Maoriland Ministers concerning Trusts, Premier
Joseph Ward announces that lie will ask Parlia-
ment to pass a squelching law next session.
Years ago Seddon rose up with violent threats
against the Trusts (mostly operating from outside
the Dominion), and outlined a Monopolies Pre-
vention Bill. The proposal was to establish
a tribunal consisting of three Supreme Court
Judges and two non-judicial members; and an
illegal trade monopoly was defined as “ any
agreement, whether in writing or not, the dom-
inant object, or one of the main objects, of which
is (1) to destroy, restrain, or prevent the reason-
able trade of other traders in the same or a similar
trade; (2) to enhance the price of goods sold by
the parties to such agreement, whether such
parties are engaged in the same trade or not,
beyond the price reasonably obtainable for such
goods if such price were determined by the
operations of reasonable trade competition in the
absence of such agreement.” The Court was to
have power, provided proof of monopoly was
shown, to annul contracts, order the monopoly to
cease, and order any corporate company respon-
sible for a monopoly to fie wound up. Seddon
never passed that Bill, and his threats didn’t per-
turb the trusts and monopolies worth tuppence
farthing. Ward, so far, hasn’t published the
details of his proposed Bill; but, apparently, the
main power in it will be a long-range gun to
cripple “a powerful outside company which
practically controls the oil and kerosene business
of the Dominion.”

The civil case of Pktch v. Bear, which was a
wrangle re the ownership of 300 oz. of gold, and
concerning which a Melbourne Judge confessed
himself puzzled by the audacious perjury on both
sides, has resulted thusfar in the arrest of Nathan
Bear and his hopeful son, on the information of
Petch. Nathan is charged with fraudulently
converting Petch’s mysterious gold to his own
use, whilst son Samuel is charged with false-
swearing as to certain financial transactions
between father Nathan, uncle Isaac and his
young self. By thus appearing as prosecutor,
with the police at the back of him, Petch draws
a herring, so to speak, across the scent that ap-
pealed most pungently to the public nose. Nathan
Bear, now charged with fraudulent acquisition of
the precious metal, is the man who alleged that
detective Macthingummy tried to blackmail him in
the first instance; while prosecutor Petch is the
alleged writer of a letter (which the Judge ac-
cepted as genuine) suggesting that Bear aforesaid
could “ well afford to give the D.’s a hundred or
two.” Infinitely the most important question
was, “Did Nathan Bear commit perjury when
he swore that the detective tried to blackmail?”
The shortest way to investigate that was obviously
to charge the man with perjury. But instead of
taking steps to assert the purity of the police
force in Melbourne, the Crown Law people switch
off on to a question of the ownership of the gold.
Why? Doesn’t the purity of the police force
matter ?

“ Wilkins,” more in sorrow than in anger:—
I suppose “ some day” some of us will have to go into
mourning for another King ; and between now and then
we might try to make up our minds, not how sorry we
ought to be, but how sorry we ought to seem to be.
Surely nobody can deny that some of the recent mani-
festations of alleged grief have been the hollowest
mockery. Can’t we be sensible and genuine in our
sorrow’? I know when 1 hear a man telling his wife in
public what a precious darling she is, I always
1 >ok to see the lines of private trouble under
her eyes; and when I And a man showing himself
inconsolable for the loss of his spouse, I look for the re-
marriage notice inside a few months. The last lady I
knew who hung crape round her children when one of
them died, cleared out and left them inside 12 months.
There are people who must demonstrate or burst; but
they are not usually the people who really feel deeply ;
and w’hen they shriek “Disloyalist!” at the man who
isn’t demonstrating, it is quite likely to be a case of the
paste sneering at the diamond. What sense is there, for
instance, in silencing the clocks on public buildings? Is
anybody the better for it? Supposing the man who
orders it to be done had lost the dearest relative he had
in the world, would he feel any better for it if it
were done then? If he owned the clock, and his
chief understrapper ordered it to be stopped, would
he say “Thank you!” and mean it? If the under-
strapper were as sorry as he wanted to appear, would he
be likely to think of doing such a thing? But the clock
foolishness is only one of many. At a country School of
Arts, when the young men turned up in the evening as
usual and asked for cards—“My God!” exclaimed the
man-in-charge. “Cards at a time like this!” So the
young fellows mooned out —and some dropped in at the
pub, and some hung about the corners. I don’t want to
stop anybody from being grief-stricken. lam very sorry
myself. But if when I die my dearest friend makes such
a parade of his grief as we have been expected to make
lately, I shall (being informed of the circumstances) be
very doubtful whether he was the genuine friend I took
hint to be —a friend who would go half way round the
earth for me, and not let a soul know that he had done a
thing.
Last week a Melbourne detective—one Charles
Manning —was charged at a suburban police court
with indecent behavior, and the circumstances of
the ease were as fully unsatisfactory as had been ex-
pected. A respectable girl deposed that while she
was walking in Stud ley Park on April 14, a man
carfie towards her and misconducted himself and
spoke to her. She identified Manning as the
offender by his appearance ; and she more posi-
tively identified him by his voice.’ The defendant,
however, produced a number of witnesses, who
swore an alibi on his behalf. Manning was
acquitted on this charge. Then came the
case •in which a younger girl (only 10
years old) stated that on April 22 she was
walking through Studley Park, when she saw
Detective Manning committing the same sort of
offence that the other girl had charged against
him; This child’s father is a policeman, and he
immediately sallied forth with another constable
and found Manning and took him to the child,
who identified him. The evidence in this case
was accepted by three of the five magistrates, and
the P.M. in the chair sentenced Manning to a
month’s imprisonment, stating that he regarded
the offence as “ something due to some form of
mental disturbance.” Thereupon, two of the
honorary magistrates objected. They couldn’t
agree to the imprisonment of a detective. The
P.M. had said that a majority of the five found
the defendant guilty, yet when one of the minority
protested against the sentence of imprisonment,
he followed up his protest by stating that a
majority of the Bench were “ for a fine.” Which
was equivalent to saying that at least one of the
minority had found the detective guilty enough
for a fine but not guilty enough for imprisonment.
As the result of which unreasoning agitation on
the part of the honorary beaks the conviction
is to be appealed against. A feeling of pity for
the possibly mentally-disturbed detective is quite
compatible with a feeling of contempt for some of
the beaks.

The people who run the consecrated Catholic
Press (Sydney) seem determined to play into the
hands of the D.T. and the other rags which are
doing their worst to rouse a sectarian blizzard at
the coming State elections. Last week the C.P.
rose solemnly to warn the Labor party that it
must not think it had nobbled “ the Catholic
vote.” That vote “could be taken away as easily
as it had been given ”; and if certain things hap-
pened, notably the nomination of Orangemen as
selected Labor candidates, the vote would be
withdrawn. The Catholic vote, it was gently
insinuated, was controlled by the Catholic
Press, and its fiat governed the disposal of the
visionary object. As a matter of accuracy, there
is no Catholic vote worth mentioning. Many
prominent Catholics worked strenuously for the
Fuse; but the great mass of Catholic voters be-
long to the working classes, just as the great mass
of every other denomination does ; and they voted
for Labor, not because they were either Catholics
or Calathumpians, but because they were Labor-
ites. All the same, the C.P.’s desire to pose as
something large and influential is likely to do
much mischief by rousing the Seven Devils of
Sectarianism. It may not rouse the “Catholic
vote” worth tuppence; but if it goes on this way
it certainly will rouse the Yellow-pup vote.

“The Third Degree,” the new Sydney
Theatre Royal production, is one of those works
which, as J. C. Williamson put it in Melbourne
the other day, “get the play-going public below
the second waistcoat button.” The overpowering
financial necessity to assault patrons of the
drama in this spot, and afterwards to soothe
them with a “happy ending,” makes for the
play’s weaknesses, which are mainly matters of
faulty construction and improbable situations.
The first two acts are fairly convincing and
highly dramatic. We accept, uncomplainingly,
the theory that a police official with sufficient
brutality and energy of character to howl
accusations at a semi-inebriate for seven hours,
might finally hypnotise his prey into confessing to
a murder of which he was guiltless. Many people
would own up to wholesale massacre if thereby
they could end seven hours’ conversation with the
sort of policeman that is presented at the Royal.
In like spirit we accept the wonderful little wife,
and her pluck, resource and determination. We
are even resigned to the queer parent who, being
a representative of “three generations of
American society,” turns his only son down
when the latter makes a mesalliance , and
declines to move hand or foot on his
behalf when there is a prospect of the
family’s name being associated with an
electrocution. The feature of the show which is
most incredible is that which is most heartrend-
ing. There is no earthly likelihood that. Mrs.
Howard Jeffries, after being publicly disowned,
and insulted in private by Jeffries, sen., and after
being turned from the ancestral door with con-
tumely, would in the hour of her hard-won
triumph have the insane chivalry to pose as an
intriguing adulteress in order to make things
pleasanter for her persecutors. It is a flagrant
contradiction of the most definite feature of the
very human character of Mrs. Jeffries, jun.
—her calm, strong sense of justice and equity.
However, the lunatic act is calculated to
extort a loud sob from the audience, and
so it is exploited. It is an instance of the
way Art must suffer when people’s waistcoat
buttons are assailed. The play finishes in a thin,
minor key. The apologetic bxit of the outrageous
old father in • Act IV. is one of the feeblest and
most trying events of the sort that the writer has
witnessed outside a Bilanderson piece. Summed
up, “The Third Degree” suggests an Alfred
Deakin oration with the peroration at the wrong
end.
* * * . i *
For the plot, the author seems to have
gone to the Thaw unpleasantness and inverted
things. Harry Thaw was a murderer,; Howard
Jeffries, jun., isn’t. Evelyn Thaw’s wife had a
lurid past; the wife of Jeffries is and always has
been,as good as. gold. Evelyn Thaw went back
on her husband when trouble smote him, and was
only dragged to, the scratch by bis relatives and
the lawyers they hired. Young Mrs. Jeffries
sticks valiantly to her Howard, and saves him
in the face of his family’s opposition. And so on.
The “third degree” business, where Jeffries
(having been discovered-in a drunken sleep in the
home of a suicide) is mentally tortured by a police
captain with a view to making him admit to
murder, is “featured” for the same reason that the
“ Mammoth Railway Smash” is dragged into a
less ambitious variety of dramatic effort. It is
frank, not to say rank, sensationalism.
* * ■ * ' *
However, it is sensationalism that is re-
markably well done. Cyril Mackay has not
shown Sydney anything better than the anguished
Jeffries, wildly striving to convince, the brow-
beating police captain of his innocence. The
captain, powerfully played by George Bryant,
has been accepted in the U.S. as the real thing.
His manner to society at large is the manner
of the every-day policeman to a “drunk”—
which is to say insufferable. Considering him,
one ceases to speculate why the States possess the
biggest crime bill on earth. The only wonder is,
if Clinton is a fair sample of the force,
that there isn’t a wholesale lynching
every few years—of policemen. Miss Kather-
ine " Grey has a fine emotional part as
Mrs. Jeffries, jun., and she gets every ounce out
of it. Julius Knight is excellent as Brewster,
the lawyer who is persuaded to take up
Howard’s case. His scenes with Miss
Grey constitute most of the bright, ar-
tistic spots of' the show. Sydney Stirling
(Underwood), Leslie Victor (Dr. Bernstein) and
George Chalmers (Jones) provide skilful character
sketches. Miss Ethel Warwick looks well and
acts restrainedly as Mrs. Jeffries, sen., and the
r6le of her husband is efficiently taken by Winter
Hall.

“Aladdin” departs from Her Majesty’s
(Sydney) this evening, after a triumphal run of
10 weeks. To-morrow (Friday) the Pitt-street
house will mourn for Edward VII. with closed
doors; and next day J. C. Williamson’s New
Opera Co. will start on a brief week’s revival of
“ The King of Cadonia.”
* * * *
As The Bulletin went to press, Oscar
Asche and Lily Bray ton were making a triumphal
last appearance at Sydney Criterion. Next
Saturday “Pete” is due there, with Mr. Matheson
Lang in the name part, and his wife, Miss Hutin
Brittin, as a winsome heroine or something.
It was no small contract that William
Anderson took on with his vaudeville company on
Saturday night in Sydney. To start with, he had
to unwind it in the Standard Theatre, which to
the average theatre-goer is practically out of
(own ;. then, the prices charged to the people who
do know where the Standard is, and watch for its
attractions, weren’t what they were used to;
finally, there was no particularly big “ turn ” to
entice the public from the mid-city theatres. And
Bilanderson knew that the only way to
make the show gee was to send along his
mascotte manager (Michael Joseph). So Michael
came, and had a look at the weather, and walked
round the Block three times, and shook hands
with all his friends and half the strangers he met,
and said, “I forget your name, old man; but
you’ll remember me—Joseph, Michael Joseph,
Anderson’s great variety show —what’s yours?”
It was therefore no surprise to find the theatre
crammed, with Michael Joseph shaking hands
with the people who were being turned
away, saying, “I forget your name, old
man ; but you remember me, don’t you
—Joseph, Michael Joseph—Anderson’s shows
—come round on Monday.” Most of the
entertainers are from “ The Babes in the Wood ”
pantomime, which Anderson recently ran in
Melbourne and a few other places. It is a fairly
good, even show, with Nat Clifford as boss
comedian and Miss Lea as bossess. Nathaniel
has some good songs and some good patter;
also he has some seasonable patter—season-
able, that is, for a cold night. Marshall
Palmer, Foreman and Fannan, James Hughes
(the baritone). Claude Solomon (the violinist),
Heller and Walhalla and a few others helped the
firm to keep up its reputation. Until further
notice the Standard will house the party.
“ THE BOY SCOUTS ” AT THE
SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Patrol-leader Fred Bluett and his fine body of
men scouting in George,-street.
Towards the end of this week Sydney
Tivoli loses the Two Falcons and the Two Bells.
The front rank of the show will then consist of
Olive Lenton and her band of eight girls, the
two thought-reading Howards, Alburtus and
Millar, and Fred Bluett, military reformer and
comedian. Bluett’s joyous burlesque of the Boy
Scout has tickled the city almost into convulsions,
and the muster roll of the Broomstick Brigade
seems likely to suffer severely from it jn the near
future. The good cause of Cheerfulness receives
further assistance from a number of other per-
formers, the brightest of whom are Fanny
Powers, Baby Watson, the Wheelers, and Vaude
and Verne.

The last nights are announced of Wirth
Bros.’ Circus in Prince Alfred Park (Sydney), and
the elephants are now engaged in tuning up their
aeroplanes in readiness for flight. No man
knoweth the number of the last nights ; but there
cannot .be many of them. The news that the
caravan of diversion will shortly move off should
start another siege of the hard-worked box office.

On Empire night (May 24) the N.S.W.
Public Service Association will give up worrying
about the increases in salaries that never mature
aftd the good jobs that are filled from outside the
service, and concentrate its forces on a “grand
patriotic concert ” at the Town Hall. Last year
the building was packed with ticket-holders ; but
as a better programme is promised for this year,
the obvious thing appears to be to start in at once
to reserve a seat. Walter Bentley will provide
one of the items on the bill by reciting “Half a
League.” etc. This has no reference to the N. S.
Wales Liberal League, which, it is understood, has
been only a quarter of a league since April 13.

Melbourne last Saturday was in a mind to
look for amusement in Hugh Ward’s production
of “ The Girl from Rector’s ” ; and, if a favorable
start were a guarantee of a long run, the new
farce at the Princess’s could be backed to stay.
It is about equally wild in extravagance and giddy
in character. Its improprieties are in a sense
excused by its absurdities. With nothing of pos-
sibility in the plot, the characters are insufficiently
real to be condemnable. Objections to the im-
moral tone of “ The Girl from Rector’s” are met
by the argument that ic has no tone at all. It is
merely an inhuman shriek. Lacking the flavor of
human interest, it leaves no bad taste in the
mouth. Those who want such an entertainment
can get no harm by satisfying their want. Nor
any good.
A wealthy young Richard (Mallalieu) in
New York has been lured into the frivolous life
by a white-haired sinner (Wykeham), who calls
himself Andy Tandy ; and a joyful female (Grace
Palotta), known as Loute, is the third partner in
their revels. She and Richard have .abided to-
gether for two or three years, seemingly. He
would rather like to shake her off and get formally
married to a milder piece of goods ; and, as a first
step to this end, he shakes off Tandy. Mean-
while his cousin. Professor Maboon (Hugh
Ward), who is a caricature of a man accentuated
by solemn entrance music from the orchestra, has
become engaged to a Michigan girl; but when she
and her impressively prurient mother come to
hand in her fiance’s wake, she betroths herself to
Richard, whilst the Professor is arrested for
lunacy, a real lunatic being conveniently situated
in a room upstairs. Mother and daughter’s name
is Copley (Celia Ghiloni and Ruby Baxter).
When Richard goes to Michigan to marry Miss
Copley he finds that Andy Tandy was really
Copley paterfamilias dissipating in New York
whilst he was supposed to be sugar-
planting abroad, and that Judge Caper-
ton (Greig), a friend of the family, is
the lawful husband of lurid Loute aforesaid.
Loute is in the habit of spending 2-12ths of the
year at Michigan as the Judge’s frigid spouse,
and the other 10-12ths she devotes to New York
and naughtiness. The Judge, being frozen out
of his wife’s endearments, flies to parlormaids for
kisses, and Maud Chetwynd, being the parlor-
maid at Copley’s, is kissed freely. The situation
at Michigan is as follows. Young Richard,
already married to Miss Copley, is forbidden by
her mother to hug the bride until a further nup-
tial ceremony has been enacted. Tandy dare not
expose his unexpected son-in-law as his former
orgy-colleague. Neither of them dare denounce
the Judge’s wife as Loute ; nor can she proclaim
the faithlessness of her Richard. And when Pro-
fessor Maboon, bidden to the wedding of the girl
whojiltedhim, finds that her father and the Judge’s
wife are the sinners who foregathered with her hus-
band in New York, he is too staggered for utter-
ance. Besides, the third act closes with a
diversion. Three ballet girls, including the parlor-
maid, prance into the Copleys’ drawing-room and
engage in a dancing tournament with the men.
Owing to this indiscretion the bridegroom is
sentenced to take Loute to supper at a restaurant,
where bedrooms are available for couples who
register themselves as married. The Copleys and
the Judge pretend to be members of the staff,
and the unvirtuous Loute is supposed to be assist-
ing them to punish the young man. In the course
of adaptation from the French this part of the
farce has lost all claim to reasonable considera-
tion. Finally, the lady characters, save Loute,
retire to their rooms, and Loute orders her Richard
to live happily with his bride on the understand-
ing that she herself is about to thaw towards the
Judge. The Professor meanwhile is meandering
helplessly around.
* * *
Hugh Ward, as the Professor, is a cari-
cature who doesn’t matter much, but is strictly
humorous in make-up and deportment. The
essential meanness of the learned scarecrow is
cleverly sustained. One or two incidental char-
acters are also humorous, and for the rest there
are personalities and situations. Wykeham is a
rather crude Tandy, and Mallalieu carries no
weight as the young man ; but Celia Ghiloni is a
broad, substantial mother-in-law; and Grace
Palotta makes a bright, spirited Loute in a series
of charming gowns. Also, her hats are striking
features of the well-mounted show.

Postponing its first appearance on account
of missing its train in Sydney, the Besses o’ th’
Barn Band did not open in the Melbourne Town
Hall until Monday evening. The programme was
of a certain elevation, and exhibited the “ Besses’ ”
aristocracy in the brass-band world. Commencing
with the “Schiller” march by Meyerbeer—a
lordly theme, with the cornets seizing passages
and using them as musical trapezes —the “Besses”
plunged into Suppe’s light “Poet and Peasant”
overture, and, later, Owen’s tremendous
arrangement of Rossini’s compositions. This
last item, which displays the super-excel-
lences of Rossini, has passages that conjure
up nymphs disporting in nectar, in satin
bathing suits. Despite their seeming difficulty
and sumptuous orchestration, the whole series of
selections were rendered with refinement, ease
and charm, the finale to the overture from
“ William Tell ” being a striking climax of melody.
Gounod’s valse “ Marguerite” was music blown
with a fastidious exactitude; and the excerpt
from Bizet’s “Carmen” was like a liqueur that
follows a heavenly feed. The items by the soloists,
W. Ryder (cornet), E. Brightwell (xylophone),
and E. P. Kerry, jun. (euphonium), were inter-
esting and often startling, the work of the youthful
Kerry approaching perfection. In Winterbottom’s
rich “Fantasia Fantastique,” this young man
turned the somewhat limited euphonium into an
instrument of lusciousness and laughter, and cer-
tainly gave evidence of that magical tone and
expression which he has Often been accused of
possessing, Ryder, a dandy among cornetists,
played sundry morceaux in Hartmann’s “ Ar-
bucklenian ” with a tasty fancifulness. Alto-
gether the programme, including sundry encores,
was superior and polished, and to the imaginative
must have excited all kinds of visions of color,
from the tints in Constable’s landscapes to the
hues in a pageant of bloodshot eyes. The
“ Besses’ ” season in Melbourne, by the way, will
probably conclude on Saturday, so thar, they may
enter upon a long-contemplated tour of Victoria.

At the Royal the weeks of “The Ar-
cadians ” are wearing away. A University Night
arranged for last Friday has been postponed to
some date in June, so the bill will hold out
until then, anyhow. Meanwhile the guileless
Sombra is growing somewhat apathetic and care-
less in her missionary work, and Simplicitas is
wearing an “egg-cosy,” which is considered to
be something exceedingly funny in fashionable
headgear. It is a cloth covering, purporting to
be a brown hen, and designed to cover a dish of
boiled eggs, even as a tea-cosy used to cover a pot
of tannin. On the head of Cromwell it looks like
a hen endeavoring to hatch some ideas.

The brief revival of “Sweet Nell of Old
Drury,” at Her Majesty’s, Melbourne, again
snows Miss Nellie Stewart in all the efflorescence
of her beguiling arts. The actress is much the
same charmer in her pretty gossamer part, though
her Nell is gaining in years. Last Saturday, one
saw a Mistress Gwynne that once or twice seemed
rather over 30, and, in the first act. particularly,
somewhat physically artificial. Still, if it could

he seriously objected that Nell Gwyne in Act I.
was slightly bad in art, it could also be admitted
that she was not so bad as she was painted. In the
later acts, however, her color was in the strictest
harmony with the scenery, and her dressing
and intensive by-play in accord with the dissolute,
shallow age. Moreover, she acted with respect-
able craft throughout, and received valuable
assistance from some members of her company.
Harcourt Beatty tinged Charles the Rake’s care-
less bonhomie with Baptist melancholy. Eardley
Turner was picturesquely capable asPercival, the
actor; James Atholwood displayed his meatiness
in the tiny part of Lacy ; and Harry Hill’s con-
ception of Lord Jeffreys had considerable melo-
dramatic value. The ladies—among them Misses
Madeline Meredith, Gwen Burroughs and Rosslyn
Vane—were mostly the trivial people they were
meant to be. To-morrow (Friday) being a day of
fasting, to-night (Thursday) should witness the
final appearance of “Sweet Nell of Old Drurv,”
for on Saturday “A Waltz Dream” will waltz
better than it dreams, if it doesn’t dream better
than it waltzes.

“The Village Blacksmith,” which has
been running at Melbourne King’s, is to be re-
placed on Saturday by a revival of “ Thunder-
bolt,” the stormy bushranging drama. The
Bulletin regrets to hear it, for this paper had
developed a fancy for the people in the black-
smith's entourage. It was especially attracted
by that prince of Hackenschmidts, the burly
Captain Leo, and was working up an affection for
the spirited Albert Bailey. And The Bulletin
loves Bailey, because in “The Village Black-
smith ”heis so perfectly in his place. Indeed, as
a pedlar of gags, he has more right than “the
village smithy ” to the “ spreading chestnut tree.”

“In a Billiard Room,” the new turn of
Inane de Lyle and Brunin, at Melbourne Opera
House, has some skill and freshness, but lacks the
accuracy that might make it a tour de force. All
that the gentleman does is to take a billiard-table,
cue and ball, and propel the SDhere with sufficient
strength against the bottom cushion to make it
rebound towards him. Sometimes he catches the
ball in pockets attached to his person, or on the
trigger of a revolver fastened to his somewhat
distinguished head ; but sometimes he doesn’t.
_As for the rest of the Rickardian programme,

Clarence Tisdale is warbling some more of his

“Two Portraits,” Tait’s most superior
picture at Melbourne Glaciarium, is the common
Paris tale of dissipated marital affection ; but the
death of the wife and the worthlessness of the
rival are shown with more than the customary
moral irony. As regards the other films—or some
of them—“ Playing Truants ” appears as an im-
politic suggestion to nippers to “ wag” from
school ; “Dave Craggs ” is a fable revealing a
detective’s unnatural sagacity; and “The Final
Settlement” is a tragedy built on the theatrical
effect of “ flier-rink. ”

of Mt. Etna in eruption; a series of views of

of the sugar-cane industry in the Sunda Islands.
Also West crowds into an already heavy bill an
artistically-wicked item christened “ Paris After
Dark.” In this film are observed an Apache male
and female clutched together in “La Valse Noire,”
which might be black in Paris, but looks some-
what blue in Melbourne.

Miss Maud Grantham recited “The Cricket
on the Hearth ” at Melbourne Athenaeum Hall
last week, even more dramatically than she had
given the “Carol” some months ago. With half
a dozen vocal items interpolated between the
“chirps” of the old Dickens yarn, and with a
tasteful stage setting to brighten the effect, Miss
Grantham’s entertainment seemed equally short
and sweet, though it lasted hours. A
rich, musical voice and a versatile talent for
mimicry are only two of her qualifications for
the brainy work she undertakes. She has a
graceful, unaffected style in “gripping” her audi-
ence. The strong personality is never seen to be
asserting itself. Her characterisations provide
their own pathos or humor, whilst the recitress
carries her hearers through the literary passages
of the story without any apparent elocutionary
effort. One would like to hear her in a programme
of Australian short stories, or in monologue
sketches, with incidental songs. For it was as a
sjnger that she appeared on the platform before
she turned her talent to Dickens’ recitals.
Melbourne’s musical world has an assort-
ment of interesting matters in view. Nellie Mond,
the girl with a talked-of voice, is to try its
effect in the Town Hall on the night of Wednes-
day, the 25th ; and on the following Saturday the
wondrous fingers of Carreno will tickle, stroke
and thump the keyboard of a grand piano at the
same building. The Carreno recitals will be only
a short series, Benno Scherek states, and the
maximum price of seats will not entail an
enormous increase in the rent charge. Previous
to Miss Mond’s concert at the Town Hall there is
to be one farewell appearance of Elsa Fischer at
the Masonic. The dramatic soprano from Syd-
ney was a Melbourne student ere she crossed the
Murray, and local talent claims her as one of its
own.

Joseph McCabe, who opens his Australian
lecturing tour on Evolution at the Melbourne
Athenaeum Hall next Saturday, has a big English
reputation in the lecturing business. In simple
and attractive style he tells his audience what
modern science has done in many mysterious
fields of inquiry. Moreover, the slides with
which he illustrates his remarks are a revelation
in the art of microphotography, and an entertain-
ment in themselves.

The Dardinis, American humorous jug-
glers, make their first Australian appearance at
Adelaide Tivoli. The lady of the party is little
more than an agreeable circumstance. The man
who does the work is skilful and daring, though
handicapped just now by a recent vaccination.
He does most of the things Cinquevalli did, and
his assistant copies the business of that great
man’s helper. For a while the house is pleased
but not excited. Then original business begins.
The assistant coon (stage variety) drops a
plate he ought to catch. (Smiles.) The next
he holds—so hard that it comes away
in pieces. (Laughter.) The next he catches
safely—and breaks while showing his pride
and joy (much laughter). . . . The 13th he
sits on (roars of laughter). .. . The 37th he
smashes deliberately with a hammer, and leaves
the stage a welter of broken china and the
audience weak with continuous delight. Vasco
of the mad music, and Alexandra and Bertie, the
gymnasts, have since come in, and help to build
up an unusually strong programme; it includes
the clever Macleans, who deserve f* name of their
own, but are still content to be known as “the
Australian Dartos.” At the Royal, “The Waltz
Dream ” has been going strong. The. small house is
crowded—and so is the small stage. Most of the
fun is in the hands of the newcomers—Langford
Kirby, the light-footed ; and Florence Vie, the
pleasantly massive. The play seems to require
both of them to be more unattractive than they
make themselves.
Seventy-one years ago last Sunday the
first R.C. service was held in Melbourne. The
Rev. Father Geoghegan celebrated Mass in a
building at the corner of Elizabeth and Little
Collins streets.
E. C. V. Broughton, the Deformer who
took George Reid’s King-division seat in the
State Assembly when the fat gentleman went to
the House of Reps., has decided to go out for
good. The little man has always been one of the
jokes of the House; but when he looks at the
result board after the coming election he will
probably remark that those laugh best who laugh
last.
Wade is giving everything away—includ-
ing his party. His latest announcement is that
almost everybody in the public service is to have
a rise. The daily papers which support him refer
to this as statesmanship. When some mythical
Labor candidate, just prior to the : Federal elec-
tions, said that the old men in the Destitute
Asylums ought to have another plum in their
puddings, they referred to it as bribery.
At the declaration of the Senate poll in
Victoria, Trenwith suffered a characteristic re-
ception. “ Traitor !” “ Turncoat! ” were some
of the terms heaved at him by a kind congrega-
tion ; and, when he suggested that his hearers
ought to be a little more generous, he only in-
creased the flow of epithets. Probably Trenwith
had earned a bitter bombardment, but there is a
time when abuse is an abuse of itself. And that
time is when a man who was damned at his meet-
ings and damned at the ballot-box comes up to
congratulate the men who had honestly beaten
him. Trenwith has never been wanting in cour-
age, and in this case he strictly observed that
decency which some of his audience lacked.
Mary Ann Wackefct, of Melbourne, who is
74 and probably feeble-witted, has suffered from
the Victorian Law’s sense of outraged justice.
Frequently the Law will overlook the strongest
allegations against its detectives, but it could not
ignore the dereliction of poor old Mary. Mary,
who had led a blameless life and had reared ii
children, is said to have made a false statement
when applying for a Federal old-age pension.
She had admitted that she had £250 in a country
bank, but is reputed to have concealed the fact
that she had banked £72 somewhere else as
well. Thereby Mary committed what P.M.
Morrison described as “absolute, downright,
deliberate fraud/’ and deprived the Common-
wealth of a pension of just £6 per annum.
Fortunately, however, Morrison is a humane man,
or it might have gone hard with the old lady.
Fully recognising that she was a first offender, of'
decided age and failing intelligence, he did not
sentence her to death or order her a hundred
lashes. He merely presented her with hard labor
in gaol for 14 days. But here Mary, far from
being grateful for the gift, lodged an immediate
appeal to a higher court. And in the Lord’s good
time the upper court will probably alter the
decision of P.M. Morrison.
“ Trotter ” : Many have found the Oceanic
Museum at Monaco more interesting than any-
thing else there. The Prince has just; opened his
magnificent new Oceanographical Institute. There
is nothing like it in the world. I propose such a
one for Sydney. It embodies an aquarium, with
every exhibit that can be imagined connected
with the sea. The Prince’s millions are undeni-
ably dirty, but he consecrates them to this
splendid fad of scientific yachting work, like that
of the Challenger, persevered with continually.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Snell”: Spare a poor critic from the deliberate and
wanton equivocator. “Harrison O.” (P.P., May 12)
attempts to butcher me to make a puff paragraph. I
complained of Miss Grey as a "wretched dresser.”
“Elaborate frocking” is not the only alternative to
dowdy dressing. Tasteful and pleasing gowns are not
necessarily expensive. I gave no honest opening for the
insinuation that fine feathers would lhake Miss Grey a
fine histrionic bird. * All the tailoresses on earth would
not make her a great actress. Shirley was not “ broke ”
if “paw ’’ was; she was the celebrated authoress of a
“best seller.” Furthermore, her dressing wasn’t cheap ;
it was dear enough, but dull. Not much is to be gained,
however, by arguing on this theme with a scribe whose
quaint taste drives him into instancing Eugenie Duggan
as an elegant dresser. Eugenie is more in the way of a
plush suite.
“Vic.”: This week’s obituary includes Martin Forde, a
humble comedian esteemed by a wide circle of friends,
brother of John Forde and Anna Forde. Martin’s best
achievement was as pantomime clown in the theatrical
generation before last, with Jack as pantaloon. Anna
Forde was Melbourne’s most popular burlesque actress
for a year or two. She was the Octoroon introduced in
the pantomime of “ Robinson Crusoe,” with Harwood as
Crusoe. But Anna hated the spangle and tinsel of the
stage, and gladly retired into private life. Sturdy and
worthy John Forde advanced from pantomime to singing
in Williamson, Garner and Musgrove’s opera company,
and will be remembered as the original Major Murga-
troyd in “Patience.” I never saw such a straight-up,
erect, arrow\v family as my friends the Fordes. In baby-
hood each, I think, had to swallow a ramrod.
“ 0.K.”: Re CalvO, the first question is, Does a coneert-
platform-singer transgress the canons of High Art by
acting an operatic scene in ordinary evening-dress with-
out a stage scenic-setting, i.e., by presenting herself as
half Calvb and half Carmen (or Santuzza, as the case may
be) amidst surroundings which are wholly platformal ?
She suits the action to the word without being dressed
for the part, or staged for it: therefore the hybrid effect
is least convincing to them who are most familiar with
the possibilities of the operatic scene. FrOm any
point of view the performance is artistic, of course.
It may be called legitimate art if it conveys a
feeling of the opera to people who have had no
theatrical experience of it. But in the Highest
sense of the term it isn’t Art academical, neither of the
concert platform nor of the stage. It goes too far to
satisfy critics of cultivated taste, or it doesn’t go far
enough. Calv 6, throwing a red rose coquettishlv into
barren space, and tripping skittishly from the platform,
followed at a respectful interval by the pianist, leaves an
impression of an anomaly. She is the actress in concert-
singer’s clothing. Her two capacities clash, as the
Chancellor in “ lolanthe ” u'ould say. Other soprano
vocalists score their most brilliant platform successes by
singing boldlv to the flute. Calve makes brilliant eyes at
the flautist whilst piping thin falsetto notes in unison
with his —the thinnest of them, by the way, being so com-
pletely inaudible that they have to be taken for granted.
Clearly Calv 4 is a great artist rather than an astounding
vocalist, and certainly her artistry is not so ver-
satile as that of the operatic singers W'ho, having
two moods and manners, can “ let themselves
go ” on the stage, but will sing the same arias
with an air of repose on the concert platform. As to the
question whether the classical platform atmosphere is so
cold that the exotic warmth of a histrionic vocalist is
often desirable, the controversialists can agree to differ.
As to the classical style being more in harmony with
platform effects, there can be no reasonable question.
The calm, mechanical piano imposes a duty of self-
restraint on the artist who sings beside it. The
accompanist is forbidden to get excited. His assistance
must be strictly unobtrusive. The flautist, when
he is required, takes his stand on a particular
spot and sticks to it. The performance is, in
fact, a musical test, and to be truly har-
monious it must be as free as possible from demon-
strativeness. It is for the audience only to get visibly
excited if the musical effect be fine enough to stir them.
When an imperturbable-looking vocalist with an uncon-
sidered accompanist moves a critical cold-blooded crowd
to enthusiasm, you have a supreme triumph of platform
art. Well, the art of Calv 6 is not like that. It is essen-
tially Franco-Spanish and vivacious, whereas the art of
her compatriot, Dolores, is Franco-British. The two are
almost as wide apart as the tropics and the Poles.
Bert Gilbert, who is showing some of his old time form
in “The Dollar Princess,” gets off a good one—“lt’s no
•use trying to live a champagne life on a beer income.”
Somebody might invite State Premiers and Treasurers
round.
“ Ganesha ”: The Sydney theatre audience is the most
joyoyis in the continent. There is no doubt about it.
Before the rag goes up I wait, and seldom wait in vain,
for a pleasant argument between the ehucker-out and
some obstreperous member of the audience, during which
the w'hole theatre, or rather the whole upper section of
it which I frequent, takes enthusiastic sides. Some old
lady is sure to attempt to climb over some forbidden
barrier, and be hauled back amid the hilarious plaudits
■of the crowd. She never does so in Melbourne. Even
sedate shows, like Shakspeare and grand opera, cannot
dull this pleasing boisterousness. Sydney seems to have
an unlimited supply of applause and apples and banter
and fancy whistling. , Is there more fire in the peanuts,
more salt in the Neapolitan ice-cream ? Only in Sydney
•do people take their theatrical sorrows pleasurably.
What is the cause? I am not angry. I ask merely for
information.
Consider the gramophone how it improves, and how
the public taste in music improves with it. In Mel-
bourne one drops into the gram, room at A. P. Sykes's
warehouse, and hears the finest warblings reproduced
with nearly all the coloring and sweetness of the
originals. Between the earliest and the latest of the
Melba records the difference is remarkable ; yet not so
remarkable as the increase in public demand for operatic
arias and such-like, whilst the craving for music-hall
items has diminished. People who spend £2O on a
gramophone (not necessarily the most expensive) and a
first equipment of discs are critics these times. They
turn Melba on immediately after Tetrazzini, or vice
versa , and compare the voices. They note the difference
in style, tone and volume between Caruso and his biggest
French contemporary. They get the respective measuresof
the English tenors and baritones in the same ballads, and
a rough i nterpretation of a song by a robust singer on the
platform impresses them no more. They have heard
something better from the funnel in their own house.
And so it is with instrumental solos. A great educator
is the gramophone.
Mrs. Rebecca Tolano, who died at Newtown on Sun-
day, was the widow of Ralph Tolano, a well-known
dweller at Poverty Point in Australia’s old days. He was
at one time lessee of the old Victoria Theatre. A son—
Joe—used to be a member of George Rignold’s co., but
now keeps a “public” in the ’Loo.
“M.P.”: One of the “Girl from Rector’s” posters at
present occupying the hoardings of Melbourne was cen-
sured in U.S.A. because it read “A spicy salad with very
little dressing.” The poster shows a waiter with a cray-
fish on a dish, topped with a girl of the flapper variety.
But the bill hereabouts merely shows the illustration.
The reference to the salad is replaced with information
about “ The Girl’s ” success in ’Murka.
“ Billy B.” : I’m satisfied that if anything will laugh
the Toy Scouts out of existence it is the burlesque of the
Barnum business that comedian Bluett is providing for
Rickards. It is the best “ turn ” Bluett has put on for a
long time. The make-up is just the real circus—the cow-
boy hat; loosely-knotted handkerchief round the neck,
a la Grace Darling ; the short, black pants leaving about
three-quarters of a naked leg on view ; and the pole with
which to leap over mountain torrents and forests. Only
one detail is wanting—the bunch of ribbons at the end of
the abbreviated pants. These ribbons are worn as a
perpetual token of the Battle of Mafeking, one strand
being added to the bunch each year. Bluett has either
overlooked that fact or is ignorant of it. But I’ll forgive
him ; for that “ turn ” I’d forgive him if he stole my beer.
And if the three kids that form the greatest caricature
of the Barnum Brats up to date are ever short of a home,
I’ll adopt the lot.
“O. K.”: A Poverty Pointer remarks that the Bilanderson
drama story of a shopgirl stealing the name and “papers”
of a lady corpse is another crib from “ A Modern Magda-
len,” and that the plot of. a Williamsonian production
(viz., “ Zira,” wherein Miss Anglin appeared) was “a
similar steal.” Now “ A Modern Magdalen ”is the title
of a recent novel, I fancy. The incident in Bilanderson’s
show was cribbed from Wilkie Collins’ story, “ The New
Magdalen,” which was dramatised long ago. And the
play that Miss Anglin appeared in was the same old
drama, lock, stock and barrel, fraudulently presented
under a new title, with different names to the characters
and a slightly altered conclusion.
“ Jean S.” : Bernard Pshaw’s new play or “debate,”
“Misalliance,” has not been received with a blaze in
London. The Spectator complains that it “ shows no
unexpected change of manner or matter. Small parts of
it, especially at the beginning, are boring; and it con-
tains the inevitable feeble jokes.” Max Beerbohm, in
the Saturday Review, is equally unappreciative. “ Mis-
alliance,” he says, “is about anything and everything
that has chanced to come into Mr. Shaw’s head. It
never progresses, it doesn’t even revolve, it merely
sprawls.” It appears to comprise selections from Shaw,
set to the infernal music of the superwoman. The
heroine is a re-embodied Anne Whitefield, who was
singular when she was new, but is now looking a little
mid-Victorian. One commences to suspect that Shaw is
becoming lazy, and is tending to create a sort of dancing
cinematograph of the early Shaw.
“A. T. Soon”: One of the most joyous turns I ever
. remember sitting out at Rickards’ Melbourne Opera
House was a sort of vocal impersonation of Uncle Tom by
a favorite burnt-cork artist of the period, who owned a
tremendous voice. The artist was by rights a comedian,
but his soul had evidently revolted at the flippancies
whereby- he got his living, and he had turned for a little
temporary relief to the Uncle Tom sketch. It enabled
him to appear with his face blackened and yet to be
deadly serious. To the accompaniment of sad “ planta-
tion” music, he tottered painfully on to the stage garbed
principally in a grey wig, long “duster” coat, ragged
trousers, and battered panama hat. In his trembling
right hand he bore an ancient carpet bag, and in his left,
a murderously heavy stick, with which he pounded on
the stage as he walked. When at length he reached the
middle of the stage, he turned a face like a boot-polish
advertisement up to the gods, and commenced to sing
something to the effect that he was at the point of death
from the cruelty of Legree, and liable to be laid to rest any
minute in “ de col’, col’ groun’.” The doleful information
was published in his usual immense bellow, and the
roar completely nullified the actor’s studied totter, and
made a jest of his aged garments, his carpet bag, and his
grey wig. It was impossible to believe that a negro
capable of making that much noise with his face could be
within 30 years of the undertaker. In fact, as the deafen-
ing performance proceeded, one began to harbor the
idea that Legree was really a courteous and considerate
soul with a love of quiet, and had reluctantly discharged
uproarious old Thomas for howling in his ear. As the
song came to an end Uncle Tom removed his hat with an
air of resignation and resumed “ de road to de buryin’
groun’.” And because we were young and irreverent, we
applauded him wildly, and made him come back from the
grave and roar the last verse again.
“Centre”: As to the flickergraph. “Jape” (B.
28/4/’10) says he knows little of Tassy. This scribe knows
much, for his sins. Any person owning a machine is
hereby cautioned, exhorted, enjoined and implored to
shun the Island. The picture-show business is absolutely
busted there. To the N.-VV. Coast town where I live
there come about once a month divers forlorn wretches,
each with a machine which he calls the Smithoscope, or
the Robinsongraph. In each case it is the best in Tassy,
bar none, and has no connection with rivals ; and in each
case there is the same complete and utter frost at every
town from Launceston to Strahan. The supply of these
pathetically-hopeful unfortunates shows no sign of les-
sening. One can’t blame the public for staying away, for
the machines and the films are generally wretched ; and
thus has the pitch been queered.
“Cockaigne” : The London Lyric Theatre has just re-
vived Sheridan’s “ Rivals,” and it is found to be roaring
in fun. Australia would relish it once more. The Lon-
don production is entirely subdued from the farcical.
Even Bob Acres is not low comedy. The champion
Australian cast was : Sir Anthony, Lambert; The Cap-
tain, Heir; Sir Lucius O’Trigger, G. V. Brooke; Acres,
Coppin ; Lydia Languish, Mrs. Heir; Mrs. Malaprop,
Mrs. Phillips (mother of Hans).
“Ganesha”: Re “S.S.’s” query concerning the de-
cadence of the dress-circle. They favor the stalls in
England, that is all; and we, when we are shown how,
go and do likewise. The new fashion gives society a
further opportunity to display its bon ton by referring
gracefully to a stall, d, la mode ; and it smiles, with in-
tellectual superiority, at the vulgar provincialism of
those who still fondly haunt the discredited dress-circle.
Such foolishness will be till stalls and circle and boxes
are abolished, as at Wagner’s Theatre at Beyreuth,
wherein the seats, at least in theory, are all equal.

The Commonwealth Portland Cement Co., of

kiln of about 150 ft. long is in course of erection, and the
Company have ordered two Bleichert Aerial Wire Rope-

CULINARY DRAMA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Knight’s judgment as a producer was shown.. ..
The milk boiling' over in the Jeffries flat, in the last act,
while the smell of cooking was distinctly noticeable, was
a realistic touch in stage management.— Sydney Tele-
graph (17/5/' 10).
Crime , Love, Joy, Tears in cot and farm and grange,
And Core dispersed about in gouts and blots ;
And over ev'rything the haunting, strange,
Pervasive atmosphere of fried shallots.
The culinary hero at the farm
Whereon he toils is shown (Act I.) with Meg,
His girl. He swears to shield her from all harm ;
Then strides within and poaches her an egg.
With furtive, crawlsome step the villain comes;
The comic lawyer follows at his beck ;
’Midst wail of violin and roll of drums
They grab a barnyard rooster by the neck.
Beneath the shadow of a wall (0.P.)
They build a fire and quicken it with oil;
Pluck the slain fowl, and next with horrid glee
Deposit it within a pot to boil.
Attracted by the savor of the stew
The local Force arrives. The murd’rous pair
Depart; the hero reappears anew,
And is arrested, to his girl’s despair.
Act III.: “ The Portland Kitchens.” ’Mid the stoves
The much-wronged man is seen in servitude,
“Crooks” and armed warders hang around in droves,
And ducks and geese—deceased and in the nude.
“ The Flight,” likewise “The Moor by Night ” are shown.
The ’tecs appear. “ Men, lam in-no-cent! ”
The persecuted one is heard to moan.
“ Yer lie,” they hiss. “We twig yer kitchen-scent.”
And so the play proceeds, until at last
They who first brought about the hero’s fall—
Convict of onion-filching in the past—
Are lodged in quod and forced to own to all.
The curtain falls amid a grateful smell
Of frying chops and steaks and fricassees,
Boast calves and other viands, which go well
At convicts’ “ Welcome Home ” festivities.
Crime, Love, Joy, Tears in cot and farm and grange.
And Gore dispersed about in gouts and blots;
And over ev'rything, the haunting, strange,
Pervasive atmosphere of fried shallots.

The little movement in Sydney to procure
a better time for dogs, temporarily or perma-
nently friendless, recalls that when food once fell
short in Governor Phillip’s day, he ordered all the
dogs in the settlement to be killed. “Useless
mouths,” he said “and not entitled to be fed.”
A problem that has cried aloud for solu-
tion ever sir.ce men started making laws pushed
its old grey head into the Camberwell (Vic.) court
the other day, when a tidily-dressed woman asked
the Law to declare her two youngest children
“ vagrants,” and commit them to the schools, so
that they might be boarded out to her at so much
a week. Her husband, she whispered, was doing
18 months for embezzlement, and she had found
the struggle too much. The Law remarked that
the case was one for a Children's Court, which
didn't happen to sit that day, so she would have
to wait till it did. Heaven knows why it should
be necessary to go through all these forms at all,
or why the wife of a man doing a sentence
shouldn’t be able to call at some public office every
week or month aud collect his surplus earnings
for the maintenance of his family. It costs about
17s. a head per week to maintain each prisoner in
Victoria’s gaols, and it should be easy enough to
make each man earn that and 20s. over for his
wife and family.
Australia should get good value for the
£2OOO which has been granted to send a rifle team
to Bisley. Not one member of the side has been
to see .T. Bull before, but all are tried shots, while
in Arthur Cutler (one of the “ Bathurst burrs ”)
and J. H. Williams the team holds two of the
most skilled marksmen in the world. The most
satisfactory thing of all is that there is such a
wide field of choice that it is not necessary for the
same old crowd to be given a chance at the plums
every time. Australians have shown at Bisley
that they can more than hold their own with the
best in the world, while in all-British matches
conducted on the home-and-home principle
they have established a remarkable record.
The Ballarat Infantry put up a world’s
record a few years back in the Schumacher
trophy competition, while the Cutlers’ Bathurst
team ran away with the Daily Mail event this
year. This must do some good. When foreign
nations see Australians showing up consistently,
and realise that so many men can pump shot after
shot into a space little larger than a man’s head
at any distance up to 1000yds., it won’t make
them any more anxious to come this way looking
for trouble.
The Boy Scout fever has reached a
dangerous temperature in South Australia. By
wav of a beginning, the first “State Scout Com-
missioner” was one Joseph Regis Ooorv, »
Syrian, or of Syrian extraction. Seeing that
Joseph Regis Coory runs a factory, mostly de-
voted to the manufacture of ladies’ underneath
mysteries, and hadn’t any claims to be a soldier,
the reason for his appointment was not too
obvious. Partly on this account, and partly
' because others wanted the advt., there was
trouble on the “staff” from the start; and
when Joseph Regis started a Girls’ Scout
“ Troop,” Adelaide howled unanimously, for
it doesn’t approve of its female infants
of 16 or so wearing dicolleti evening dress
as to their legs. Presently the Syrian Commis-
sioner was gently but firmly deposed, and a
doctor enthusiast took his Governor
Bosanquet is. however, the “ Chief Scout ” of the
State, which waits anxiously to see him in his
official garb of bare knees, etc. An elderly
Governor’s knees should be edifying. The dis-
possessed Coory has now formed the British Boy
Scouts, and between them and Baden Powell’s
circus there is fierce enmity. But a Syrian head
of a British movement is typically British,
anyway.
A PASSING FANCY.
JONES: “ What! Engaged to the beautiful Miss Millyus. and gel not happy!"
SMYTHE : “ Well, old chap, she has so many fads that how can I be sure I'm not merely one
of them ? ”
THE CITY WHERE EVERYBODY WARES ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF THE PAVEMENT.
DAMAGED ANGEL (reproachfully): “ Shining brother, I presume that you are recently
from Sydney.”
The Circus Scouts’ performance —miscalled
a review—which Barnum Powell had arranged to
take place before King Edward, was more like an
aboriginal corroboree, or the Dervish prelude to a
holy war. According to the cable, “ thousands of
cheering Scouts were to have made a simul-
taneous rush until they encircled the King.”
Then, after singing, “Hail to Our Chief,” they
were to “squat down in silence and listen to the
King’s address”’ However, before the day fixed
for the absurdity, the popular monarch fell sick
and died. It was a narrow ©scape.
Some time ago the Chinese in Sydney im-
ported a yellow tutor from their native cabbage
patch, so that the young Chow might absorb Con-
fucius and trimmings along with the lore of the
foreign devils. One of the great dailies proudly
printed a photograph of the schoolroom, and the
gamboge academy started off with a triumphant
crackle of Caucasian advertisement. The school
then dropped out of public recollection. Last
week, at the sitting of the Presbyterian Assem-
bly, whilst the report of the Foreign Mission
Committee was being considered, one C. Cox
arose and made a statement regarding the
“work” of the scholastic alien which made the
congregation sit up and stare. Briefly, it was
that the “tutor” made the pupils bow down every
morning to the image of Confucius, and that a
Chinese preacher of Christianity who had objected
to the practice was secretly tried by a number of
Confucians and sentenced to assassination. Ihe
plot, however, had been betrayed by letters, the
threatened man had so far not been harmed, and
“some of the leading Chinese residents had
since written to the committee that worship of
Confucius in the school would be allowed no
more.” In the light of this occurrence—and of the
glare of the burning China Inland Mission Station
at Yuen-chau —the statement made by a speaker
at Bathurst (N.S.W.), at a meeting of the British
and Foreign Bible Society, sounds pathetic. Ihe
optimistic pietist expressed it as his opinion that,
bv strewing China with the Scriptures, “the
British Empire would be adopting the best means
of averting the Yellow Peril.’ And while he
was saying that, the Peril was in Bible-strewn
Sydney, bobbjng industriously before old Con-
fucius, and threatening to murder its Christian
brother who entered a protest against the idol-
atry. As Corporal Neild knows, St. George
didn’t stop the dragon with a heap of Bibles last
time he encountered the beast.
* * * *
John Storm is dead. He was hanged by
his neck in Adelaide a week or so back. The
dailies called him Carlos Augusto Bonelio; but,
then, they have no imagination at all. He was
suspended for the murder of Gloria (or rather
Norma) Plush, who annoyed Augusto by bestow-
ing her affections upon another male (say Drake,
orLord Bob Ure) and ultimately caused Carlos to
do away with her. “ I shot her to save her from
evil” was Mr. Storm’s explanation of the episode.
Like Hall Caine’s heroes, Bonelio was “a deeply
religious man.” During .his trial he announced,
“I am one that preaches the gospel; I am a
teacher of the Holy Scripture ; I am an upholder
of righteousness.” The holder-up of righteous-
ness, before going to the gallows, repeated to an
officer of the Salv’army the parable of the h oolish
Virgins, remarking “ My lamp is trimmed and
burning brightly ; I have the oil of grace in my
soul.” Then he sang a hymn and invited the
Salv’army man to meet him in Heaven. But he
would really be a very unpleasant person to meet
anywhere.
NEVER NEGLECT A COLD.
A cold should never be treated lightly, as it is
always more or less serious. Many people make
the mistake of neglecting a cold until some serious
lung trouble results. If every cold received the
attention it should have the danger of this would
be avoided. Every cold can be cured by the use
of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. A bottle or two
of this remedy taken when the cold is first con-
tracted will promptly cure it, and not only save
doctors’ bills, bub much suffering and annoyance
later on.*
A butcher shot himself dead in Sydney
last week. The usual inquest was held, and the
widow and two sons gave evidence that the
man was in the habit of promising them a nice,
pleasant family murder. The elder son told how
he had seen his father, after quarrelling with the
younger boy, sharpen his butcher’s knife, try its
edge, and then take the weapon to bed with him.
The widow at last bought a revolver, but the man
found it and used it—on himself. The case recalls
two others of recent date : that of the farmer's
wife who was at last obliged in self-defence to
shoot her husband, and of the son who was forced
to shoot his father to save the lives of others.
This habit of family murder, actual and
threatened, may be a hard one to deal with ;
but if it goes much farther it looks as though
something will have to Vie done. Either every
father of a family will have to turn up for mental
examination once a year, or the lady of- every
house will have to swear once in the same period
that she and her family haven’t heard murder
mentioned with a personal application during the
twelve months.
“ Jean Sibi’s ” feelings are hurt
Melbourne’s mourning once or twice descended from
the dignified into the dissolute. I pass over the draping
of faded oleographs of the deceased with black and
purple and pardon the attachment of legends which
were a raucous reflex of the sorrow out of which the
newspapers coined many an extra copper. But I cannot
forgive some other exhibitions of the grief that has pre-
vailed during the last two or three days. One suburban
estate sounded a rich note of pathos by inscribing
his “To Let” cards in black and purple inks; and
I know a butcher who hung some of his mutton
in crgpe, and garnished his dishes of dubious
mincemeats with rosettes of black and violet. But even
those expressions of sorrow were surpassed by another
dealer in slaughtered stock. With a touch of originality
bordering upon eccentric genius, he shut out of his
windows everything but black puddings. The spectacle
of the rotund sausages was very touching ; but, all the
same I would like to know whether he had grief or
greed in his mind while he was making his “decora-
tions.”
THE BACKING OF THE GUN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ lie [Archbishop Donaldson], a poor parson in the
Afridi country, among savages ready to slit throats, felt
quite safe. He felt then lie knew the power of the Kng-
lish name.”— Archbishop Donaldson, at St. George's
Society banquet, Brisbane.
Said the Bishop : “ I was traveling in the Hill-land long
ago,
And the savages they used me quite respectful—they
did so:
Ne’er a knife they' turned upon me, ne’er a weapon
did they draw,
‘For,’ said they, ‘ this is the Bishop, with the Book and
with the Law.’ ”
In the wild Afridi land
See the warriors meekly stand,
Not a wicked wish among them—ne’er a one 1
How respectful do they look
On the Preacher and the Book,
When the Book has got the Backing of the Gun !
Said the Bishop: “ What a tribute to the Gospel and the
Name!”
Said the Bishop: “ What a token of the might of
Britain’s fame ! ”
He was there without a cartridge, not a penknife in his
belt,
And he came away uninjured, not a shot-hole in his pelt!
In the wild Afridi land
O ! They seem to understand
If the Preacher's toe is injured there’ll be fun 1
They may not be deeply “ shook ”
On the Parson or the Book ;
But they know who’s got the backing of the Gun !
Once, away in ancient story, by the Lake of Galilee,
There was One who loved the people, took the children
on His knee ;
When the Pagans haled Him crossward, when they nailed
Him on the tree,
There was none to ’venge His murder with a dread
artillerie !
But to-day the heathen knows
There'll be slaughter, blood and blo.ws
If the veins of but a single preacher run.
O ! The Shepherd and His crook
May look pretty in the Book ;
But the modern shepherd leans upon the Gun !

THE LOST REFORMERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When first I came to Hell, how great
Was my surprise on spying
So many men of pious weight
Among the sinners frying—
So many I had known on earth
As saints of quite exceeding worth.
Here one who saved a thousand souls
In two wild weeks’ revival,
With naked hands piled glowing coals
Upon a new arrival—
A missionary doomed to stew :
A gospel-singer known to you.
And over there upon a grid
Writhed Melbourne’s great reformer ;
A brace of Yankee preachers hid
In corners rather warmer ;
An imp who worked a spit with speed
Had left the world a brand-new creed.
“ We’re damned for our unselfish worth,”
Said one in sulphur laving ;
“ We were so busy there on earth
The souls of others savipg,
We reached this place ere it was known
We’d quite forgot about our own ! ”

“ The Snake ” (in kilts) :
I ve just pot, news from the Hielands that the flpry cross
Sent r , ollnd the clans bv the Scottish
Wationahsts, and woe to the wretch who fails to rear at
this dread sign of the ready spear.” The Nationalists
demand restoration of the National Parliament; of the
owl# Nat, ' ,nr, J Mir, t I° l the Privy Council; of the
Scottish Court of Admiralty; and of the “stoneof destiny ”
"P°" the ancient Burpoo Kinps used to be crowned
with the haggis pat or some other national jewel, and
which is now in Westminster Abbey. Also the border is
to be harried with a demand that St. Georpe and the Drapon
shall be ehminated from the British coipape, and with
another demand for the restoration to the Highlands of the
ancient tribe system, and the return of the people to the
land of their fathers, as well as the restoration and preser-
vation of the Celtic lanpuapeand national garb. But the
mam reason for skirling the pipes is for “ the restoration
of our ancient, lepitimate and hereditary Royal Stuart
family, now lineally represented by If.R.H; the Princess
Ludwig of Bavaria, w-hose lepitimate title is Queen
Mary 111. of Scotland ano Great Britain, and IV. of

“Truthful”: Whilst waiting for my
tram the other morning I noticed that the chemist
had arranged his window, and I strolled over to
have a look at it. The mourning for King
Kdward was very tasteful ; it consisted of a broad
strip of soft, black material suspended from the
roof of the window and tied in the centre with a
purple and white bow. I admired it as an
unusually chaste design. Then I caught sight of
aportrait of the dead King draped with black,
it was supported by a large bottle of bronchitis
All round the window were more bottles
of bronchitis cure. Here and there were little
pyramids of tin boxes filled with brown lozenges.
A placard guaranteed them to cure bronchitis
promptly. I turned away feeling rather sorrow-
ful ; bronchitis is one of the complaints X haven’t
got. But oh 1 the heartfeltness of this shop-
mourning !
THE INFIDEL.

And look at me! ”
Ballarat is making a good deal of fuss
over a tree. It was planted by George V. when
he was a small hoy. Immediately Edward VII.
died, the eager councillors had a large plate
painted, setting forth that this tree had the inex-
pressihle felicity to have been planted by his
Most Gracious Highness George V. Pilgrimages
to the shrine have started, and it is to be carefully
railed off, presumably to prevent some ultra-
loyalist hanging himself from its revered branches.
After all, it is just as -well not to throw
too heavy a brick of scorn at the benighted coffee-
colored brother of India who connects the comet
and Edward’s death. For there is a Sydney
daily paper which got in early with this meteor-
ological gem :
Sydney this morning waited in breathless anxiety for
the news which some grim foreboding seemed to tell the
people was winging its way southward. Fearsome old
Father,Death was clutching at his royal prey in London,
and the gaunt, hand seemed to spread the world over,
until even in distant Sydney its icy approach was felt.
A people waiting in sad silence for the news which
would soon flash over the wires to the Southern Hemi-
snhere, waiting and sorrowing. At the street corners
little groups stood expectant. Some intuition seemed to
have carried to them the knowledge that during the
inor ning they would hear of the death of their King.
JUven the clouds wept.
It makes one wonder what blue-pencil remark the
bluff and breezy Edward would have made on
that outburst if he had been in the sub-editor’s
uneasy chair.

You wouldn’t look for humor in a nuis-
ances inspector; but Stawell (Vic.) supplies the
goods. A while back live subscribers to a local
hash-magazine wrote to the council complaining
of the manners of a common or moo cow, ‘’belong-
ing next door,” which persisted in bellowing half
the night arid committing assaults on the mid-
night calm, besides other breaches of the peace,
and asking that it be shifted somehow. Of
course a cow, like .a barking dog or the barndoor
rooster, is a nuisance ; but most of Stawell wor-
ships Cow, so the council hedged by desiring
the Nuisance Discourager to turn his intel-
lect on to the job. His report showed him to be
conscientious and thoroughgoing. After narrating
at great length that he had duly inspected the
premises and the obnoxious beast, he said lie had
found everything apparently correct, but to make
sure had “ made a pathological examination of
the animal, and had discovered that, owing to
certain physical peculiarities, she snored in her
sleep. He had thereupon communed deeply with
the owner and had prevailed on him to curtail
the beast’s supper allowance so that she should
slumber more lightly—and the boarders more
heavily.” Stawell’s councillors seem to have
taken the report in dead earnest; anyhow, they
passed it in proper form.

Adelaide Police Court has made a bold bid
for the absolute record in technical absurdities.
A Glenfelg shopkeeper was summoned for keeping
his shop open in the evening, with two sons to
help him. The first of State’s Early Closing
Acts brought such a shriek from small shop-
keepers in the suburbs, where most of the business
is alleged to be done after dark, that a weak-
backed Parliament passed an amending Act
allowing a proprietor to keep open if alone, or
with a member of his own family to help. The
villain at Glenelg let two of them help him ; and
it cost him £2 at the hands of the outraged Law.
“The Recruit”: Apropos Edward VII.,
the strictness of Court etiquette, and the casual-
ness of the Australian. I
was one of the Cohentin-
genters who were after-
wards chosen to represent
Australia at the Corona-
tion. One afternoon in the
grounds at Buckingham
Palace, after saluting the
King and Queen and re-
ceiving the Coronation
medal from a bored Prince
of Wales, we were supposed
to march back to our places,
stand to attention, and
watch about 2000 more
black, white, and brindle
representatives get theirs.
We stood it for a while;
then, our supposed national
tired feeling getting the
better of us, we squatted,
and finally lay down on the
sward—in front of the King
of England ! Did he ob-
ject? Not in the least.
Simply sent one of his staff
across to our commander to
say that we could go on
taking it easy for the re-
mainder of the review.
Thomas Atkins, of the Foot
Guards, present on duty,
nearly fell from his perch
in amazement, and thought
we’d surely be shot at day-
break ; but instead, at the
close of the ceremony, the
King, though still suffering
from Iris appendicitis opera-
tion, rose, and in a short
speech to us wished us God-
speed and a safe return to
Pur homes. And we went
home feeling that, although
Edward Rex was a King, he
was also a man with a vast
amount of horse-sense. And
we somehow got an idea,
too, that he knew that, if
our fellows could now' and
then do a pretty strenuous, useful thing, it was
chiefly because they didn’t use themselves up doing
useless things.

Fremantle got a trifle ahead of things
when the two Jap warships turned up at the Wes-
tralian port the other day. By some blunder the
Monkey flag was run up on the staff at the Town
Mall, and it fluttered there in the faces of an
astonished people until the Mayor was rushed on
to the premises, bursting with an order to drag
the thing down instantly. What the Ichichi
admiral said hasn’t transpired. The chances are
that he stamped his little foot and said—“ Fool!
We are not ready yet! ”
Oft I hear of people groaning
With a cold they cannot cure,
And I think what useless moaning'
Hapless mortals do endure.

SYMPATHY.
HE: “No more horses for me! I've given up
racing—it took the conceit out of me.
SHE: “ Oh, poor boy! Why, then, you’ve got
nothing left at all!”
Trouble proceeds apace at St. James’,
Sydney. The issue is: Shall the incumbent of
the big King-street church wear lace, lawn and
other dry-goods, or shall he not ? The congrega-
tion says that if he is to get any of its thrip-
pences, he shall; and it keeps nominating parsons
whose partiality for female nightwear while, in
the execution of their celestial duty is known.
As fast, however, as they are called. Arch-
bishop Wright, to whom ecclesiastical mil-
linery is abhorrent, vetoes them. On the other
hand, he doesn’t attempt to appoint one of his
own sartorial way of thinking, for the sound
reason, doubtless, that, lacking the financial
assistance of the congregation, the job is worth
only £3 a week. The result is that, in and imme-
diately around St. Ja,mes’, Beelzebub is enjoying
a practically unhampered run. Incidentally,
many Ritualists who used to frequent the church
have taken to staying at home on the Sabbath, in
consequence of which they are losing the only
exercise they ever took on that day, and are
developing hob-nailed livers and the uncharitable
thoughts that march with dyspepsia. To the lay
mind it seems much needless to-do about nothing.
Why give away weight to the Powers of Darkness
in this futile fashion ? Why shouldn’t the congre-
gation subsidise someone to uppercut Satan week
by week in blue dungarees, if their tastes are that
way?

When the Federal Quarantine Act was
passed, one of the clauses which occasioned the
least concer n to the mail-steamer companies was
that relating to a ship’s doctor. The billet of
medical officer on a passenger-ship is mostly a
sinecure. The general practice is for a medico
who wants to cross the world cheaply to sign on
as doctor; or the billet is taken as a pot-boiler
by somebody for a variety of reasons, ’ among
which medical reasons don’t occupy a place. The
opportunity for practice on the mailboats seldom
comes, and when it does, it isn’t always relished.
A medical practitioner serving three years on a
vessel would be equivalent to a confessed failure.
But the operators behind the Federal Quarantine
Act have begun to have serious views about the
marine doctor, and already two medical officers
on big steamers have been prosecuted for failure
to notify scheduled diseases. Either they knew
those diseases, and, to save trouble, didn’t report,
or else they didn’t know them when they saw
them. It was all the same ; and the prospect of
other ships’ doctors being brought up all standing
by the Act is causing the companies to take a new
observation of the position.

The London newspapers agree as to George the Fifth’s
serious character and his knowledge of public business.

When Gipps was
Governor of N. S.
Wales immigration
troubles were much
the same as they are
to-day. There was in
existence a bounty
system under which
orders on the Treas-
ury were given for the
passage money of im-
migrants applied for
by their friends. The-
Council assured Gipps;
that the revenue from.
Crown lands w< udl
meet the bounties..
But they didn’t, fo
the bounties to , i.c
met amounted aftei m
few years to £400.000..
whereas the lan dl
revenue stood an
£14,000. Gippsatonce;
appealed to the 1 loiii";
Secretary to atop
emigration. It was;
stopped in 1841, andl
£200,000 worth off
Treasury debentures
were issued to meet
the crisis. A bright
idea then struck the
N.S.W. Council. If
£200,000 could be
borrowed, why not
borrow £2,000,000
and fill the inlands
with laborers ? Then
Gipps hit back. “The
people.” he told the
Council, “whb Want
immigrants most are
the squatters. Well,
then, the squatters wil.
have to pay for them..
I’ll be no party to in--
troducing i mmigrants on loam
money. But I’ll tax the squatters, and out.
of the revenue so derived I’ll bring in all J[
can.” At that there was a hullabaloo, and “Tax;
the squatters!” became a popular cry. Two«
parties held alternate meetings in Sydney—onei
to ad vocate paying for immigrants out of loans, andl
the other to insist that they should be paid for by-
taxing squatters and other landholders. The:
struggle was acrimonious, but ended, for the time;,
in the issue of new squatting regulations, undeii-
which a very slight increase in rent of runs was
enforced. The catch phrase of the taxing party
at the time was “ A public loan is a public curse.”

“Q.F.C.” : According to a yarn in one of
the papers, Crown Prosecutor Harris, of Sydney,
having to state the ease against a man charged
with stealing wool, broke out into this :
I do not think that any city in Australasia can beat
Sydney for the ingenuity of method in theft which is dis-
played by the professors of that art now residing in
Sydney... We had a case yesterday where a valuable
suit case disappeared, and it is evident that there must
be some organisation of receiving in Sydney which up to
the present has escaped the notice of the police. How
in the world 19 bales of wool can disappear completely off
the face of the earth, and never be heard of again is
almost beyond comprehension. Pilfering goes on every-
where. The city is honeycombed with dishonesty.
What wild statements are these to come from a
man whose duty it is to place the whole facts of a
particular case before the Judge and jury whether
those facts be for or against an accused person !
What was the Judge doing to allow such a preju-
dicial, unsubstantiated and totally irrelevant state-
ment to be officially submitted to the jury? And
what did it matter to the ease in point if hundreds
of suit boxes had been stolen from Redfern station ’
It was not even hinted that the portmanteau had
been stolen to carry the wool away in • but
because it had been stolen, prosecutor Harris;
used the fact as, inferentially, a reason whv some-
body should be convicted of stealing wool Mr
Harris sometimes acts as District Court judge'
eh f m fa V; na ™ e of ; Tlls tice. it is to be hopedi
that Mr. Harris on the bench is different from,
JVlr. Harris as Crown Prosecutor.

The WILDCAT
COLUMN
Australia’s rush back to the old borrowing
habits is shown by this statement of the average loan
expenditure per head for all States during the past five
years:—
1905 £0 17 2 per head
1906 017 7
1907 0 18 11 ~
1908 1 4 11
1909 .. .. 1 14 9
The worst reversal of form has been shown by Queens-
land,'which in that brief period has increased its annual
Cohen expenditure from Ss. Sd. to £2 ss. 2d. per
head. Actually the biggest loafer on the pawnshop
in proportion to population has been Westralia
(£3 15s. lOd. per head for last year). But this cer-
tainly can be said for Westralia—its proportion of
adult males is very large. Still that is not so
overwhelming a factor as official Westralia tries
to make itself believe ; because it means very often that
the man is only there for the time being, and has hopes
of sooner or later getting back east, and leaving someone
else to hump his proportion of the debt and the interest.
The total debt of the Copimonwealth States has grown
from £203,518,275 in 1901 to £251,773,533 in 1909, an in-
crease from £53 13s. lid. to £5B ss. 9d. per head. This
means that Australia has to pay Cohen £1,755,000 a year
more now than it did nine years ago. It is being done
cheerfully enough at present, because prices are high
and w,e don’t have to send any tremendous quantity of
goods to pay the debt. In fact, on account of the
great rise in prices, Australia is at present
actuallj' paying less in goods for the £251,000,000
than a few .years ago it paid for £200,000,000. The
burden of the extra borrowing is therefore not being
felt. The trouble will come later on when prices slump
for some reason or- other. As a matter of fact, such a
time of high prices as the present is the time, not to incur
debt, and especially foreign debt, but to pay it off.
Obviously when you can pay off a debt of £lOO with four
bales of wool you don’t want to wait until you will have
to pay six or seven bales to get rid of it; and the differ-
ence is quite as great as that between present values and
some of the values of the past 17 years.

This bank has.beeri issuing some more shares, a process
with which it is quite familiar. Usually the new shares
have been offered pro rata at a premium to persons
whose names were already on the register; but once or
twice tenders were invited from shareholders. The lot
sent out in 1908 were got rid of in that way : they brought
an average of £l7 2s. 3d. premium. For the lot lately
sent to market applications were invited at a premium of
Kl 6 per share. (The par value of shares is £10.) For the
2500 available there Were applications for 5513 : but, on
allotting these to shareholder-applicants in the propor-
tion of one to seven, there still remained 776. In other
words, the holders of 5432 shares out of the total of
17,500 neglected to apply for their proportion of the
shares available at £26. The remnant (776) were
then thrown open for tender, and brought an
average price of £2B 18s. 10d., and even at that
figure" they return 7 per cent, so long as the 20
per cent, dividend is continued. At £26 they return
£7 13s. lOd. per cent, as an investment. Of course there
is no guarantee of a continuance of the 20 per cent. div.
Still in this case 20 per cent, isn’t really as glittering as it
looks, on account of the large premiums which have been
paid for so many of the shares. For instance, as shown
just now, the 20 per cent. div. on the last lot of shares is
really only a 7 or 7§ per cent. div.
Besides having added very largely to the re-
s rves by means of premiums, the profits put by have
been substantial. The total reserves are consequently
more than two and a half times greater than the
capital; for every single share there is nearly £36 of
capital and reserves. No doubt some of those reserves
may be regarded as an insurance fund. The best of banks
make bad debts, and if bad debts come in a lump there is
nothing for it but to write off some of the reserves.
Generally speaking, however, a bank, especially after a
run of good years, has something up its sleeve—internal
reserves, they prefer to call the trifle. A moderately bad
experience can mostly be got through by drawing on this
private hoard. There is no w'av of telling for certain
what private stocking a bank has ; the only hint can be
got from the rate of earnings per cent, of capital and
visible reserves. If that rate is very high, it
is most likely that the stocking is pretty large
and full. In this case the frequent arrival of new
capital disturbs the calculation ; but. generally speaking,
the disclosed profit is somewffiere about £8 per cent, of
capital and visible reserves combined, and that is neither
very high nor very low. It is, however, high enough to
suggest that, if the cO. has no great amount of hidden
reserves, it at any rate has no great amount of unre-
munerative assets.
Business has increased solidly during the past
year. Deposits have grown from £1,913,733 to £2,346,542,
and advances from £1,842,512 to £2,031,783. The total
liabilities to the public are £2,647,081 : that means only
£3 13s. of the public’s money for every £1 of the share-
holders’, which is an unusually small proportion of
public money for a bank to have. Other things being all
right, this, of course, means that the security offered to
depositors is unusually good. As a matter of fact, the
bank could pay more than half of its debts out of its
liquid assets. $ * *

According to that reckoning, the total funds ought to be
now £30,594 ; but the published accounts give them as
£49,335. The divergence is explained by the fact
that early in the proceedings the society financed
this branch, and advanced, one way and another,
£18,741, which amount is not shown anywhere in the
present accounts. Apparently the society regards this
as money spent in advertising, or something of that sort;
and in that case the amount should hitherto have been
included among the society's working expenses. A valu-
ation of the Industrial department is made for the first
time this year, and a surplus of £8126 is disclosed. That
looks very good; still it would look different if the
£lB,OOO which has been drawn from the Ordinary
branch were treated as a liability. Apart from
this feature of the case the history of the
department is very satisfactory, as Industrial in-
surance goes. The expense rate certainly amounts
to only a penny or two under 56 per cent, of
the total income ; and insurance which runs away in ex-
penses with nearly sevenpence of every shilling paid in
premiums is far from what insurance ought to be. It
isn’t the fault of the office nearly so much as it is the
fault of the system ; and the only solid justification for
doing the business at that cost is that it gets people into
the premium-paying habit, and thus trains them for
membership in the Ordinary branch.

Two lots of people are interested in a trustee co.’s
finances—the shareholders and the beneficiaries under
the trusts which the co. has in hand. The latter people
are protected by the co.’s capital, called and un-
called ; broadly speaking, the extent of the protection
depends upon the proportion the capital bears to
the value of the trust estates. This co. does not,
however, allow that proportion to be stated, because
it doesn’t mention the value of the estates. The
paid capital is £10,000; this and the reserves are repre-
sented chiefly by a fixed deposit with the Treasurer
(£5000) and mortgages(£l2,222). The investments return
about 4f per cent.; so that apparently the mortgages are
a good lot. Besides the paid capital and reserves, clients
have the protection of £15,000 of uncalled capital, and
another £25,000 which cannot be called up by the co., but
is a reserve liability for the protection of clients—a very
good arrangement. For a trustee co. the profits are by
no means gorgeous: they have amounted lately to
£7 7s. 9d. per cent, per annum on capital and reserves
combined.

The manager draws a commission of 10 per cent, on the
net earnings ; and this amount has been deducted from
the profits shown above. The paid capital is £lO,OOO in
£1 shares ; but each share carries a liability of £4, which
is grateful and comforting to clients, though not neces-
sarily so to shareholders. Still, the reserves are substan-
tial, and it would take a bad break to exhaust them.
Capital and reserves are invested in “mortgages, land and
debentures”—a description which doesn’t convey much
real information. The land is evidently either a small item,
or it is productive, for the “interest and discount” receipts
amount to an almost exact 5 per cent, on the book value
of the investments. The, trust balances in hand are
valued at £1,425,102, as against £1,359,919 a year ago.
The total receipts from agency and commission averaged
6s. 3d. per cent, of the mean trust balances. Therefore,
assuming the whole of the agency income is drawn from
the trust estates, it costs an estate on the average 6s. 3d.
per cent, to have its affairs managed by this co.—a small
charge considering the size of the services rendered. In
fact, a high charge is out of the question in Maoriland,
where there is a Government trust office in business.
And yet the co. can pay a very comfortable 15 per cent.
The explanation is that during its 28 years the co. has
accumulated reserves considerably greater than its
capital ; and as practically the whole of the money can
be, and is, put out at interest, a 10 per cent. div. could
now be paid even if the co. didn’t make a penny out of
the trustee business. Given good management, many of
these trustee cos. are well-worth looking into for invest-
ment purposes.

The co. got there in time for the great Westralian thirst.
There had been a Swan brewery for very many years ;
but it was a small concern, and very few people thought
much of it when this co. was floated. In fact, it was one
Of the Melbourne boom floats which many people
lumped in with the wild-cats and tried to forget
all about. Consequently when calls were made such a
large number of the shareholders were deaf that in 1897
there were no less than 14,000 forfeited shares to dispose
of. By that time, however, the great thirst had arrived
in the West, and this co., whose local affairs had got into
good hands, was beginning to coin money. At that time
the live capital was about £30,000. At present it is
£101,450 in 81,160 shares of 255. each ; but an issue of
£27,000 6 per cent, cumulative pref. capital is now
being offered pro rata to present shareholders. The re-
port doesn’t mention the object of the issue ; and it isn’t
obvious from the accounts. Certainly the co. owes the
bank £34,085 on overdraft; but there isn’t much in pay-
ing shareholders 6 per cent, for money which pro-
bably can be got temporarily for under 5 per cent.
And it should only be wanted temporarily ; for unless
the directors have big purchases in view, undivided
profits ought to wipe out the debt in less than two years.
Probably there are shareholders who feel that they are
getting old, and would like a nice, comfortable 6 per
cent, without much worry ; and there certainly shouldn’t
be much worry about an investment in a £27,000 issue of
cumulative pref. shares in a co. of this sort, with assets
of about £320,000 in excess of liabilities. Of the gross
assets, amounting to £387,392, hotel properties represent
£181,342. These are in at cost. At one time a start was
made to write them down ; but presently the deprecia-
tion written off was added on to the reserves, and the
original book-value was thus restored. The directors
didn’t explain why they did this. They may have looked
into the future and seen visions of local-option polls and
compensation courts, and decided that they would be on
the safe side by keeping the pub-property figures as
large as possible. What this asset would fetch if it had
to be realised can’t even be guessed at. If local option
ruled out half the pubs there would certainly be a big
slump, because pub property is mostly valued, say, 33* per
cent, for the property and 66f percent, for the beer-pump
within it; and when the beer-pump goes 663 percent, of the
value goes. However, anything very sweeping in the way
of Cold-Tea reform isn’t very imminent in the West. The
brewery lands and buildings are also in at cost; but the
lands are understood to have a fine crop of unearned in-
crement growing on them. This item stands at £76,225.
Plant, which cost £84,458, has been written down to
£36,160—a pretty good sign that the management isn’t
the reckless financier that other “ at cost ” entries might
suggest. Two things it seems necessary to keep in mind.
First, very nearly £200,000 of the assets—say, all the re-
serves—consist of properties whose value depends to a
great extent, not on brewing, but on the continuance of
licenses; and licenses are uncertain cattle. Second,
there is now to be some cumulative pref. capital. Not
much, certainly ; but a perpetual first charge of £1620 a
year upon the profits. #

This co. has a capital of £lO,OOO ; the reserves, as shown
above, after providing for the half-year’s appropriations,
are £11,830; and the liabilities are £11,481, chiefly
mortgage. The assets include freeholds, apart from
brewery premises, £21,175 ; two-thirds of these properties
have been secured during the past 10 years, all surplus
profits having been put into them. In the past 12
months rents have produced £1876: that is equal to
£8 Bs. per cent, on the book value —a very handsome
return, provided that the capital value isn’t in danger of
slumping through local option or anything else. The
brewery assets proper—buildings and plant—only now
represent £8249; these assets are written down hard, 10 per
cent, per annum in the case of the plant and 20 per cent,
in the case of the rolling stock. The little co., mainly
through its large and remunerative property-holding, is
in a very solid state; but the future depends almost
entirely upon the success of the Raspberry Vinegar
party. For instance, though the R.V. party may not be
able to abolish beer at Albury and thereabouts, it may
be able to close upspnie of the co.’spubs ; and it is hardly,
likely that the co.’s pubs would bring in £8 Bs. per cent,
on their present book value if they were robbed of their
beer bumps. Probably in that case 3 per ceht. would be
a very outside return.

This co. is an amalgamation of the old Lyell and the
North Lyell, effected in 1903. Each wanted the other’s
ore; so the fusion has been a great success. Lyell had
large quantities of low-grade self-fluxing pvritic ores ; the
North had a much smaller quantity of much higher-grade
stuff that called for a lot of smelting. At the first balance
after the amalgamation Lyell had 4,495,310 tons ; North
had 170,494 tons. At March 31 this year Lyell had 2,973,019
tons ; the North, by reason of excellent developments, had
no less than 842,163 toils. Owing to these splendid
developments, which have now been proved down to
1100 ft., the proportion of North ore in the smelting
charge is being increased ; this has to be remepibered in
comparing smelting costs with those of previous terms.
Yet, though thfere is a bigger value in eopper.proved
now than there Was in 1903, dividends amounting to
£1,440,000, or 245. per share (20s. par value), have been
paid. It is a gfreat'record and all the greater because
in the previous 12 years or so the Mt. Lyell Co. had
itself paid £996,000 odd. The dividends shdwn in
the table include dividend and income tax; the tax
accounts for the slight variation from term to terip even
when the same rate of dividend has been paid.
The profit, apart from the metal-market factor,
depends almost entirely on the North Lyell. The big
mine’s ore averages only a shade over * per cent, copper,
a shade under 2oz. silver, and a shade over *dwt. gold.
Especially now that ore has to be mined instead of
quarried, there is no profit in this. North Lvell’s ore,
however, is worth 6 per cent, copper, l*oz. silver, and
the tenth of ldwt. of gold per ton. In view of the im-
provements in the North, it has now' been, thought safe
to make the smelting charge about one ton of North ore
to two of Lyell ore. Last half-year the North ore treated
was 67,557 tons ; the profit was a few pence under'£2 per
ton of that ore. On that basis the 842,163 tons proved
would be worth, say, £1,680,000, or 28s. per share. Still,
last half-year’s profits were under the average; for,
though copper was a very good price, the coal strike cut
into profits a bit. Further, the co. spent a lot of money
on mining and development. On the other hand, the
metal value of the ore in both mines is shrinking a trifle.
The profit mentioned wasn’t actually made out
of metals ; for the co. has gone largely into the chemical-
manure making business. It already has works at Mel-
bourne and Adelaide, and is spending a lot of money on
others at Fremantle (W. A.). depreciation has been
written off, these three works stand in the books at
£158,791. The co. must have had a lot of encouragement
to go on steadily to this expense ; but it never mentions
what that encouragement anittunts to in figures.
Accounts for the superphosphates business are carefully
left unpublished.
It was worked out just now that, on the basis
of last half-year’s profit, the profit in the North Ly'ell
(helped with the same proportion of Lyell ore and with
outside profits) would be equal to 28s. per share. But, as
shown above, there is more than enough Lyell ore to
smelt the proved North Lyell ore : Ly'ell, 2,973,019 tons ;
North, 842,163 tons. In the proportion of two to one,
Lyell can thus supply enough pyritic ore for another
644,000 tons of North Lyell ore. There is every ieason to
expect that at any rate a very large quantity will be
found. The lower levels are certainly full of hope. If so,
there is, of course, much more than &Bs. per share in
prospect. And that is apart from any increase in the
mysterious profits from the superphosphate works.
But the copper market? Well, the copper
market has to look after itself. This paper refuses to be
in any way responsible for it. The world’s production
doesn’t seem to be easing off at all, and the American
reports on the outlook are very far from cheerful. On
the other hand, the prospects for the co.’s big chemical-
manure business are very cheerful. The share market
pulled a long face the other day when the Commonwealth
Labor party triumphed at the polls and began at once to
talk about a graduated land-tax ; and promptly some of
the bears started to knock various stocks out. Lyell
suffered with the rest. Yet here is a co. with nearly
£200,000 already invested in the “super” business,
getting-not a brass farthing out of the big landlord
who grows sheep, but certain of a steadily increased
trade as closer settlement increases. Therefore the
prospects of much more rapid closer settlement ought to
have put a few shillings on to the\ market value of the
shares of this co. And the same with the shares in a
score of other trading concerns. The Stock Exchange
is, however, a bundle of prejudices ; and if an argument
bumps up against one of the cherished creeds of Fat,
then the argument has to go overboard. And it does.
Theirs not to reason why; theirs but to keep sweet
with the people with the fat commissions to give away.

This is very sick. It is 10 years now since Tiif. Bulletin
warned investors as to the probable course ( tb,q Broken
Hill lode. That far back it began to look almost certain
that the lode, instead of going down to fathomless depths,
as many people have a habit of supposing that “true
fissure veins ” must, was shaped like an up-ended V, wit h
the apex somewhere in the north end of the Broken Hill
Prop, and the legs straddling down into the South at
one end and the North at the other. That being so.
Block 14 and Block 10, being next door to the B. H.
Prop., lose the ore first after that mine. Block 14 has
kept itself alive for several years past siinplv by going
back on its own tracks and picking up the carbonate ore
which it had formerly overlooked in its hurry ; and
Block 10 has also got pretty well to the end of its tether.
The bottom level is now at 1615 ft. A crosscut having got
into the ore, drives were put in north and south ;
and, besides being Only about Bft. or 9ft. wide, the
ore there is worth only about lOoz. silver, 8 per cent,
lead, and 5 or 6 per cent, zinc—wretched stuff consider-
ing the cost of getting at it and the heavy losses there
would be in concentration owing to the large quantity
of rhodonite in the ore. All told, there are no more than
600,000 tons of ore developed; and it is quite probable
that the co. will have to leave a good deal of this in the
rickety mine. The mill used to handle 150,000 tons a
year. ' It seems as though it will never be possible to gel '
out more than 100,000 tons a year. Under the present
V there tnay be another one ; but the prospects in that
respect are just about as bad as they can be. The co. has
therefore gone on the hunt for mines elsewhere, and has
got one in Tasmania. , . " '
As a matter of fact, after allowing £BO3O for
depreciation, a loss of over £lO,OOO was made oil last half-
year’s actual working of Block 10; but £13,454 was
obtained from the sale of stored by-product*? and that
made things look better in the end. Of course the coal
strike had something to do with the loss; as the co. was
losing money anyhow, it made a virtue of misfortune,
and, having' shut up, blamed the strike for it. At pre-
sent prices it is doubtful if there is any more net profit in
the mine. Mill and otherplant stands in the books at, say,
£50,000, while the two shafts stand at £lB,OOO, and future
operations may result in replacing these assets by cash. If
the work does this much, shareholders will have done
very well. Of liquid assets the co. has £159,016 in excess
of liabilities. These assets include £88,886 to be received
from various parties to whom ziticy tailings have been
sold. It was very doubtful at one time whether all the
purchasers would be able to come up to the scratch ; but
they are all right now—unless the spelter “ convention ”
breaks and the zinc market smashes. What is going to
happen in that respect nobody knows. Certainly, every
“ corner,” “ convention,” or other similar contrivance in
the metal markets has gone to pieces sooner of later ; but
it doesen’t, necessarily follow that this one won’t last some
time, being favored by special circumstances. Apart from
being deeply interested in the matter on account of its
big sales to zinc cos., Block 10 has a pretty big lot of
stuff—probably over 250,000 tons—which it is going to
attack on its own account with a small Elmore plant.
And then it has the South Comstock, in Tasmania, out
of which it may make something. Its possessions may
therefore be summed-up as follows: —
(1) Present surplus of liquid assets , over liabilities,
£159,016. These are fairly safe, though they do include
£88,886 due by cos. which are in a risky business.
(2) 600,000 tons of ore in the mine. This may produce
pnough to turn the non-liquid assets into cash—say,
£BO,OOO. Almost everything, however, depends on the
lead market.
(3) The South Comstock property—uncertain. ■
(4) The unsold dumps ; by the time the mine is worked
out there may be 400,000 or 500,000 tons of zincy material
in these. Value depends almost entirely on the
future of the hitherto very erratic zinc market.
There are 100,000 shares in the co.

Standard-Waygood, Ltd. (Sydney), is an
amalgamation of two concerns whose chief business in
life is to put in and look after goods and passenger lifts
and hoists ; and the accounts for its first 12 months have
lately been issued. These accounts, made up to the end
of March, are “ subject to audit,” which isn't a satisfac-
tory remark to read after any published document. The
first issue of capital was £50,000 ; and goodwill repre-
sented £15,000 of the total. The co. started off amazingly
well. It, struck Sydney at a time when the place was
almost reeking with money, when the rush forinvestments
was very spirired, and when in consequence many new
speculative and other buildings and renovations were in
progress or contemplated. Business, therefore, 1 boomed
with this co. As at March 31 it held property and plant
valued at £28,034. Practically on this amount of sub-
stantial assets, the co. made a profit of £10,493. Its total
profit was £11,078 ; but £585 came from investments.
Of course there is the goodwill previously mentioned ;
but if you went through the premises with the smallest-
toothed comb in Sydney you wouldn’t be able to find
that asset. Naturally the co. feels very good. It cuts
up the profit this way :

Write off goodwill 1500
Balance forward 3828
Total profit .. .. .. .. £11,078
That leaves £9672 of capitalstill represented by the good-
will paper-asset—a very good asset just at present, no
doubt; but not one to rely upon. With things so rosy-
looking the directors think it a good time to send 25,000 of
the 50.000 reserved shares to market at a premium of ss.
—not apparently that theco. badly wants the money ; but
a big capital, even if a good deal of it is in safe outside
investments, makes it easier to divide a lot of money
without hitting the public in the eye with too glittering
a rate of dividend. This co. and the Hydraulic Power
Co. divide the lift business of Sydney between them ;
and there is some cutting. At present this cutting
doesn’t make good dividends impossible ; but there are
people who look ahead, and, seeing a duller future, advo-
cate amalgamation. From the public point of view com-
petition in this case is probably a desirable thing ; but
naturally the shareholders’ point of view isn’t necessarily
the same. If there is to be amalgamation it is very
foolish to wait until the cos. have done a lot of slashing
at one another ; for amalgamation then would, almost for
certain.be followed by a rise in prices, and that is the sort
of thing that is liable to cause trouble.

The Sa tubas Rubber Plantations, Ltd., is offer-
ing itself to the public in 75,000 shares, of which the
vendors take 12,000, and 13,000 are to be held in reserve.
The property to be acquired is in Dutch Borneo and is re-
ported to have a frontage to a navigable river, and the
title is a lease from the Sultan of Sambas, his chiefs
and Ministers—gentlemen whom The Bulletin
blushes to confess it never heard of before. That,
however, doesn’t necessarily affect the value of any
lease they may give. The vendor syndicate is
taking no cash whatever, which should be accounted to
it for righteousness ; for if there is to be nothing in
it for the subscribers there will be also nothing in it for
the vendors. The area is large, the rent small, the rain-

Potter, the Melbourne chemist, had shockingly
bad luck with his zinc-extraction patents, and died be-
fore he could do any good with them. He had the mis-
fortune to strike the Broken Hill Prop., which is a big
and awkward proposition to strike at any time. Event-
ually, after much law and Costs, which exhausted Potter,
the B. H. Prop, paid Potter’s people (David Syme was
one of his best friends) £lO,OOO, and passed over the so-
called Delprat patents in return for the perpetual
right to use the Potter process. Meantime other
processes got to work —the Elmore (Zinc Corpora-
tion), the Deßavay (B. H. North and South), and the
Minerals Separation (Sulphide Corporation). Potter’s
Co., apparently too busy with law, made little headway at
Broken Hill; and at one time its shares were worth only
a penny or two. Lately, however, the Baillieus, who
have step-fathered the De Bavay process, have shown a
more kindly feeling towards Potter’s, and they have now
an option over it; if the deal comes off the co. will have
£40,000 to cut up among the 182,000 odd shares, and
there may be more later on. The firm means business
evidently, for it has put up £5OOO.

One of the concerns put on the market during
the London rubber and oil boom was the Australian Oil
Co., Ltd., with a capital of £300,000, of which the
vendors took £130,000, payable £96,000 in paid shares
and £34,000 in cash. The vendors were the Australian
Shale Syndicate ; the properties are at Airly (N.S.W.).
This syndicate has done little work itself, but leased its
properties to the Australian Kerosene Oil and Mineral Co.
on a royalty of 7s. per ton. While that arrrangement
was in force the syndicate paid fair divs : the most was
£4OOO in 1902. The paid capital at that time was, and
apparently still is, £25,000. In 1904 the royalty arrange-
ment seems to have expired, and the syndicate has paid
no dividends since ; from the absence of any reference in
recent Mines Department’s reports it appears, also, that
nq work has been done. Nevertheless, J. Bull has been
asked to pay £130,000 for the properties. Over-capitali-
sation, with its usual evils, has been a tremendous handi-
cap to the Commonwealth Oil Corporation ; and the same
thing is being repeated here —in a worse degree, if any-
thing.

Baker’s Creek (N.S.W.) held its half-yearly
meeting in Adelaide lately. The one little flicker of hope
was the hint thrown out that an amalgamation scheme
was under consideration ; but shareholders’ consent will
be asked before anything is done. During last half-year
527 tons were crushed for 1083 oz. The co. has been
hobbling along like this for years, and seems likely
to hobble ; for when the mine fails to pay exes, the share-
holders come up to the scratch. Out of 100,000 shares
over 90 per cent, paid the last call—which produced
£2255. This,shows that shareholders have hopes that
No. 20 will prove a payable level when the shaft is sunk
deep enough.
* * * *
At the Eleanora, Hillgrove (N.S.W.), a run of
payable stone has been proved along No. 2 level for
■l3oft. ; and 220 tons returned 2560 z., with concentrates
and ap(imony ore to add to the return. Some of the
tributors have done quite well lately. It was certainly
up to them.

Ah Chow has pushed himself into most jobs in
Australia, to the prejudice of the white population the
country so badly wants ; and now he has got into gold-
dredging. Not, so far, certainly, as a dredge hand, but
to clear the country ahead of the dredges. This is hap-
pening on the Queensland border; and it is not going to
make dredging any more popular. In any case, however,
(he Department ought to sit down hard on the practice
wherever it is a matter of working Grown lands.

Oroya Links (W.A.), which started off rather
determinedly a few weeks ago to earn £4OOO a month
for shareholders, finds the strain a bit too heavy. In
view of this, the co. will probably lessen its exertions in
the direction of money-making, but sufficient profits
should nevertheless be made during the next year or two
to give shareholders 6d. as a Christmas box and add a
few thousands to the reserve fund. Beyond this, there
is nothing to justify the co. putting its trust in anything
except Providence.
* * * *
Associated (W.A.) managed to scrape together
a surplus of £1382 for April; but as the profits for the
first four months of this year are not sufficient to pay Id.
per share, it seems certain that, even at the present
slumped price, the stock still has an attraction for specu-
lators altogether out of proportion to its worth. The
outlook is positively and absolutely hopeless until such
time as the Board realises that the mine is barely a
6dwt. proposition, and sets itself the task of earning
money for shareholders on that basis. With an enlarged
mill the co. may be able to continue the distribution of
an occasional shilling dividend, but under present con-
ditions it simply can’t.
* * * *
Lake View and Hannan’s Star are now being
worked as one mine, with 8., M. and Co. as general
managers and H. E. Vail in charge. The two properties
will be connected by tramway as soon as possible, and
about half the mill supplies will then be drawn from the
Hannan’s Star arid Deep Level leases, i It is proposed to
confine the erection of most of the additional plant
to the Lake View, and to do all the ore treatment
there. The combined ore reserves of the properties are
estimated at something over 700,000 tons, but the grade
doesn’t offer much inducement to shareholders to rumi-
nate on the possibility of getting bloated.
* * * -* *
South Kalgurli (W.A.) gave its annual account
of itself in London on April 7, when actual ore reserves
were estimated at 157,000 tons, and the liquid assets were
computed at £70,000. The latter is equal to 7s. per share
on paper ; but as very little of what is in hand ever gets
into shareholders’ pockets in a case of this sort, the item
is generally open to question. Latterly the management
has had to rummage about a good deal to keep up the
output, and last month it was so unsuccessful in its search
that it was obliged to weigh in light. As the mine’s main
source of ore supply (Morty’s lode) has crossed the
western boundary and gone into the Boulder No. 1 lease
below 1200 ft., the co. will have to entirely depend on
what it can find in the main or eastern workings ; and, in
view of the poor results obtained in the last few'hundred
feet of sinking, the outlook in deeper ground is not very
dazzling.
* * * #
Westralia Waihi, a Norseman (W.A.) show,
isn’t crushing nearly as well as expected, and it seems
doubtful whether it can be made to pay for long. Some
months ago reports about the great value of the ore
being devoloped in the mine were printed almost every
day, but, unfortunately for shareholders, the mill has so
far told a different and somewhat doleful tale. As a.
result the market has tumbled ; also the manager has
resigned, a call has been made, apd everything in.the
garden looks as though a drove of elephants had passed
over it.
The local paper cheerfully informs its readers
that the Great Fingall (W.A.) has started to prospect the
White Elephant line of reef. After which The Bulletin
expects to hear that, in its desperation to prolong life,
the co. has hurriedly got to work on the Blue Duck lode.
The latest estimate supplied by 8., M. and Co.
places the Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) three years and two
months ahead of the mill, and the recoverable value of
the ore reserves is set at 355. This estimate does not in-
clude partially-developed ore, of which there is a con-
siderable tonnage in sight. Next to the Ivanhoe the
Gwalia is probably the soundest gold investment in the
West.
Cosmopolitan Proprietary (W.A.) lias started
what the local paper calls “some interesting develop-
ment on its Altona line of reef.” This may lead to the
discovery of something ; certainly, in view of the amount
of gold dug out of other parts of the property, the work
is fully justified.
Murchison Associated went gay in London last
month on the strength of a successful rubber flotation,
and the intelligence that, “after years of patience, the
Great Fingall reef, or rather w'hat appeared to be that
long-sought-after body, had been struck.” In reporting
the jollification in which the co. was indulging, a friendly
London paper says that if the surmise as to the reef
proves to be correct, the coincidence with the rubber
success will be remarkable. But supposing (which is
ever so much more likely) that the surmise isn’t correct,
and that the rubber plantation also proves to be as big a
fraud as the co.’s gold-mine has hitherto shown itself,
what then ?
* * * *
Tindals (W. A.) is still in trouble. It is said
that £lO,OOO is wanted to straighten up the finances and
give the mine a flying start. But what has become of
the 55,000 tons of lOdwt. ore and other piles of wealth
about which the chairman talked so glibly at the
annual meeting? Also, what about the immediate 10s.
to 12s. a share dividends promised by the same official?
Shareholders have a right to this information. Quite
enough cock-and-bull yarns have been told about the
value of this property already, and it is about time
the tune was changed.

“K.P.”: “The 25 miles’trip from Brunswick
Junction to Collie, Westralia’s coalopolis, takes two
hours, but there is scenery which compensates for the
weariness of the train journey. As nobody laughed when
a passenger armed with an axe asked the guard whether
he could cut sleepers en route, I presumed the jest was
ancient. Collie hasn’t been a happy hunting-ground for
Private Enterprise—which is no doubt to a very great
extent Private Ent.’s own fault. P.E. No. 1 was a
Deakin. He fused £60,000 for the W.A. Fireclay
Coal Co. at West Collie, and was the first to go as well as
come. P.E. No. 2 was one Walkeden, who spent £30,000,
mostly on a tunnel at Collie Boulder, on the east of the field;
but it didn’t lead to a coal seam—it just lead to ruination.
This was for the Scottish Collieries Co. The co., how-
ever, got a bit back when the Australian S.C. Co. took
things over, but not much. P.E. Nos. 3, 4 and 5 had
unprintable reputations. At Lunenberg, where the
trains cross at half-time, P.E. No. 5 was pointed out to
me in the outward-bound train. This was R. C. Young,
who has had a tribute of the Wallsend and Proprietary
collieries for four years. Former was the mine opened
by the Government, and later with the Proprietary it be-
came merged in the Collie Proprietary Coalfields of W.A.,
Ltd. (British). The Proprietary did once pay a very
small div. Though these are the biggest propositions on
the field, and something over £250,00Q has been spent in
wages, both have very little development to show for the
money. The co. has just given another tribute to a
syndicate of workers, with W. D. Bedlington (who has
managed all of the collieries on the field at one time or
another) at its head. Zeb Lane is chairman of directors
of the C.P.C. of W.A., Ltd. ; but things point to his
leaving shortly,
“About four years ago the local miner began to
get tired of Private Enterprise as he knew it, and to want
to do something for himself. ,A lot. of him formed the
Co-operative Collieries Ltd., and out of the leases which
the experts didn’t know what to do with they have
developed a mine vyith a- fine capacity for putting out
coal. It shares in the Government order, though it
Could do the lot on its own. It started at the tail end of
1906, bought a new plant in 1907, and got George Leitch
as manager. Leitch has only one arm (the other was
torn off in the Stanford-Merthyr explosion), but he has
several ideas. In 1908 be paid the members of the co. a
50 per cent, div: on tlaeir £25 shares, and in 1909 in-
creased it to 100 per cent. They must have asked for
more, because Leitch left them shortly after. The mine
paid another century div. the other day. Last year
some more coal-heweTs went into business for themselves
on co-operative lines, forming- the Westralian Coal Co.
This is neaF the other concern, and is going ahead,
thanks to its own efforts and the filiip, wlu ch the W.A.
coal trade got from the Newcastle strike. About eight
miles to the east, A. A. Wilson, M.L.A. for Collie, and
a party are doing likewise : and the only Private Hinder-
prise left is at> Collie Cardiff. In each of the new shows
the coal is improving, so that the real Collie should come
into existence shortly;’,’

Tommy Burns, the North Queensland tin show
which was floated a while befqre the gentleman
met his friend Mr. Johnson, has so far,,paid its share-
holders £l4 per share, which is 30s. more than par value.
Not, perhaps, that many of the public got in at par-
many of the southern public at any rate. Last half-year
(to April 20) only one div., of £2,(£1040), was paid ; but
there was a further £627 to the good on the six months’
work. One way and another there was something over
£2BOO of liquid assets in hand—mostly cash—at the end
of the half-year ; and there is still a bunch of good ore to
be got here and there. The co. has no battery, and cart-
ing is an expensive job ; so only the cream is worth while.
The show may, under those circumstances, provide
thousands more, or it may snuff out at almost any time ;
for there are practioally no proved reserves.

Mills’ United, Charters Towers, crushed 982
tons for £3228. This mine is proving the Day Dawn reef
600 ft. deeper than the Freehold has done,so the workgoing
on near the boundary of the two mines is being watched
with much interest. No. 14 level at 582 ft. east of the
crosscut is in diorite formation, with a mineralised leader
in the hanging-wall. No. 13 has been driven 1156 ft. and
has 2ft. of good stone in the face, near the boundary.
Stopes over this level are turning out some fairly good
stone. The boundary winze below No. 10 level is down
138 ft., and has a make of 18in. of fair stone in the foot-
wall. Prospects have only recently improved, and there
appears to be rather a big area of poor ground near the
boundary. New Brilliant Freehold, next door; hopes that
all the levels below- No. 2 (Mills’ No. 8) will improve as
they are driven east, which is a big thing to hope for.
The blank ground on the western boundary and the dis-
turbed dyke country at the far eastern end are causing
the Freehold crowd to pray for better things in the cen-
tre of their.lease. There is very little enthusiasm about
the opening of No. 3 level. The winze below No. 2 has
12in. of stone at the bottom “ showing mineral”—which
is vague enough.
* * * . *
New Einasleigh (Q.) has been boring No. 3 level
(270 ft. vertical). A bore-hole penetrated 137 ft. south-east
of the big stope, and the best prospect seems to be 3ft.
of ore averaging 13 per cent, though there have been
much larger bodies of poorer stuff. But these assays are
often misleading. Thus when the big ore-body was struck,
sample assays made it out an 11 per cent, proposition,.
whereas the average extraction from 15,063 tons sent to the
Chillagoe works was only 6J per cent. The contract to
supply ore to Chillagoe has been completed ; the last half-
monthly report mentions that only 368 tonsof 6J percent,
copper ore were shipped. Mungana is now sending much
larger quantities of carbonate and sulphide to the big Co.’s
smelters ; a recent week’s output was 968 tons, including
some ore from the 420 ft. stope in the Lady Jane, which
has been closed down so long.
* * * *
Manager Huntley, of Hampden-Cloncurry (Q.),
doesn’t see much difficulty in smelting a mixture of ore
from the Hampden and Duchess. He is helped to form
that opinion by recent developments below the 200 ft.
level in the Hampden’s western ore-body, which is esti-
mated to contain 45,000 tons of 7 per cent, ore, and the
improvement in the Duchess mine above the 260 ft. level.
Reserves in the two mines have expanded from 88,058 to
192,600 tons ; but 50,000 tons are reckom d at 5 per cent,
and 45,000 tons at 7 per cent. No doubt the lower grade
material can be concentrated, and the manager throws
out a suggestion that way. But Hampden-Cloncurry has
got a costly undertaking in front of it; it has not only to
continue the development of the two mines, but to link
up with a smelter. Since August £22,835 has been spent on
development.; and, although the re.-ults have been favor-
able, the failure to get a good show of copper ore at the
400 ft. level in the Duchess has cast a gloom over that
property. # # #
Mount Mollov (North Queensland) has been
unwatering and securing its old workings. This mine is
waiting for the completion of the Herberton railway,
delayed bv the heavy wet season. When that is through
ore will be trucked from the Anniversary mine and a
smelting campaign will be started. But it will probably
be brief ; for the Anniversary supply isn’t as big as the
noise that has been made about it. Molloy has also
secured a copper lease a few miles from Emuford, and
some good ore is said to be showing below the gossan
outcrop. Other mines in the district are also producing
a small tonnage of rich ore. But packing the stuff to the
railway on mules cuts deep into even 20 per cent, mineral
* * * *
Mount Warminster, the copper and lead con-
cern outside Rockhampton (Q.), looks like dead. The
last bore of the four put down killed the co.’s hopes
—and, likewise, it seems, the co. G. P. Doolette, who
had an option over Warminster, but eventually
wouldn't be tempted, is now in a position to say the nasty
“ I told you so.”

W. G. Good, manager of the Beehive, Dayles-
ford(Vic.), is a good sport to send to a has-been. The
Beehive is one of the old flatterers of Daylesford. Flat
makes at the surface yield well, hut the vertical shoots
prove duffers of the deepest dye ; 150 ft. of workings saw
the gold cut out, so that, although a reef of 4ft.
shows, colors of gold are the only possession. Good
does not despair. He finds consolation in “a
fine body of stone ”; this and the aforesaid “ few
colors of gold” enable him to predict a “good, solid
improvement shortly.” ’Twas ever thus at Daylesford.
Plenty of stone and a patch of gold to gamble on. Its
assets so far are a shaft and the 150 ft. workings, the
“fine body of stone” mentioned before, a well-defined
lode track, not at all a bad past, and the chance (which
every Daylesford miner speculates on) of alighting on
a flat make that will sweeten up yields.
• * * *
Cocks Pioneer, Eldorado (Vic.), has got an
option, with the world not let into the secret.
John Dane has been envying this Naboth’s vineyard
from the day he left it behind him in Victoria to display
his fine Presence to the West End of London. A rugged
Scotchman has heckled him from this side, because Sandy
hates the loading that nearly always goes with a London
float. But John Dane is a broth of a boy who doesn’t
mind that. “ Sure, the ship’ll carry the sail,” he says.
What Cocks wants is. cash, and a big stack of it.
Work has to.be done down the lead now, floods have
to be guarded against, and another plant must be put
up to get good yields. The co. now owns the old McEvoy
leases, so that there is plenty of room for big work and
good results. None of that sort of thing will be got
unless a good priming of cash is available. The claim is
the most nibbled-at show in Victoria just now, so every-
one wants to know just who has got the chance of
making something out of it.
* * * *
Why the Langi Logan combine failed to come
off in Melbourne was not altogether because Minister
Mcßride wanted labor conditions fulfilled. The Boards
of the New Langi Logan, the South and the North con-
tain different material. Harry Dodd is on the lot; but
while he is the big mastiff at the North and the New, he
is a small Australian terrier in the South. Then the New
Langi should have thumped on the door before it got on
to the call list. The North has £BOOO, and the South
over £5OOO, all in real cash, to play with; so
they assume the haughty air. Next, legal mana-
gers don’t like cos. to go into other chaps’ offices.
So the scheme failed. New- Langi is doing some mining
while the boring game is going on at its best on the North
and the South claims. Even the Central Cathcart has
started shaft-sinking. With that example of mining lazi-
ness gone, Minister Mcßride ought to shake the whip over
both of Peacock’s cos., otherwise the miners will starve
before work is begun.
* * * *
The crape is on the door for Victorian gold-
mining, as the April output shows a 33 per cent, reduc-
tion. Contributing causes are not far to seek. Rutherglen
deep-lead mining has faded until there isn’t the color of
a dividend to be got out that way. Ararat has had its
flutter. Pitfield can’t support a mine. Maryborough has
worked its pot out, save Burnt Creek and Duke and Main
Leads. And Ballarat mining is as poor as the average
share jobber. Quartz mining fails to fill up the gap, as
once was the case. Bendigo is a tired giant; Ballarat a.
worn-out one. Daylesford flutters don’t count for much,
and Walhalla has only a shade of the old Long Tunnel to
point to. ’Tis a sad story, but the sadness would be
greater if there were no possibilities up in the mountains
which Minister Mcßride skirted the other day. Easy
mining has been the rule for many a long day in Victoria.
Now there has to be a hard go up in the ranges to find out
treasure that is not exposed to the eye. A sign of the
times is that a Queen-street crowd is pegging out at
Castlemaine. Only a thought-reader can explain why.

John Craze, of the Zeehan-Montana mine.
(Tas.), has been bidden to report on the Tasman and
Crown Lyell. This'is one of the old Madden-Lonergan'
remnants', which was absorbed by the Coleman crowd
that ate up Frank G. Duff’s Lyell blocks. Both shows
got the gentle puff in the London “pink” press. But
the dough is very flabby now, and Craze does not put
much baking-powder in to make it fluff up. First he
cuts out the galena lode as not being worth powder and
shot. There is more zinc than galena in one part, and
more galena than zinc in another, but there is so little
of either in -bulk that the whole Of the lead forma-
tion is nob regarded by him as being a serious mining
proposition. This does not mean that Craze holds
that the show is teetotalty bust. He thinks that it
has a North Lyell chance if fooling about at the surface
is given up and sinking and crosscutting done. What
has to be gone for is copper and silver, not lead and
silver. Craze’s report was to have been tied up with
lavender to keep it out of print, but Queenstown has
every word at its command. Also, that further capital
has to be got. Craze’s estimates will be more acceptable
iti London than in Melbourne. As the money has to
come from there, what is the good of quarreling,
as the Melbourne folk are doing, over the shadow when
the substance will be forthcoming? After all, does the
mine carry a lode at all, or is not the ore in the form of
a replacement? If Professor Gregory’s opinions are
accepted, the presence of the faulting disclosed in No. 3
tunnel is a bit of the best evidence that it is worth while
spending good money to see if a substantial ore zone
does not exist at depth.
* * * *
Sticht’s half-yearly report fails to clear up two
points re North 'Lyell. One is whether the ore shoots
lean towards Lyell Blocks; the other, what the
prospects are at the 1000 ft. and 1100 ft. levels. The ore
seems to be good, as Sticht testifies that at 1100 ft. ' the
ore broken is of excellent value, and its character is in
every respect the same asin other portions of the mine.
Sticht gives the ore in the North Lyell as 842,163 tons,
but won’t sav what quantity has been opened up at the
1000 ft. and 1100 ft. levels. What is clear is that the 850 ft.
level is the big reserve of the mine. Though worked for
18 months, some of the formations are not broken out on
the floor of the level. The 1000 ft. level stopes do not look
like being in it in size with those at 850 ft. If the 1100 ft.
level be plotted out below the 1000 ft., the work seems
to point to a contraction of the big No. 24 stope, which
it was suppesed was wandering into Lyell Blocks as fast
as it could. Between No. 1 and No. 2 South drives there
appears to be a tongue of worthless country such as
occurred in No. 19 stope. Sticht surmises that the ore
proved by these two drives hang together. If so, a
widening may take place. But the question, what haH
become of the new-development ore body and some of the
minor shoots of ore developed at the 850 ft. level, has yet
to be solved by both drill and drive.

Every engineer in charge.of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in trans-
mission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Boiler Bearings
save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent, of oil, so one of
the first duties is naturally for engineers to direct their
special attention to these bearings and to car boxes for
trucks. Hyatts are in continuous use in Cement Works,
Ore Dressing Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bush-
ings of flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or
truck wheels, etc. Should engineers require further
details, they can apply to the Australian Agents, W. &
J. Lempriere, Melbourne ; or E. W. Hursthouse & Co.,
of Wellington, the Agents in New Zealand.*

The New Water Jacketted Copper Smelting
Furnace for the Hampden. Cloncurry Copper Mines is at
present in course of construction. This furnace will have a
capacity of from 100 to 120 tons per day, and is of the latest
design. The water jackets are of steel, in two tiers,
extending to a height of 18 feet above , the crucible
bottom and surmounted by a hopper frame to the level
of the feed floor. Both jackets and hopper arecarned by
steel columns. Above the feed floor is arranged a hood
over the furnace with a smoke stack about 60 feet high.
A steel goose-neck flue is carried from the hood down to
the dust chamber in the main flue on the ground level,
and thence to the steel stack 150 feet in height. As
the furnace site is quite level a steel sub-structure is pro-
vided to carry the weight of the whole furnace. This,
when filled will give a height of 12 feet over which to
dump the slag. This blast furnace is being manufactured
by the Austral Otis Engineering Company of South
Melbourne, and will be ready for delivery in about six
weeks.*

“ Steff Cas,sander ” : Hampden in Otago
(M.L.), where I spent part of my vacation, is well
known for dairying. As it. is in a prohibition
area, my stay lasted only six bottles; the difficulty
of obtaining more days, I mean bottles, being too
stupendous. I never saw such quiet cows before
as I saw in Hampden. Feed is so prolific that
the beasts lie down to gorge, and won’t budge
until they are dragged home by the tails. As
walking round the cows makes too long a
journey, everybody hops or jumps over them. All
the men in the district jump like hurdlers
—one, two, three and over. The children
of Hampden run about barefooted. They are also
good jumpers, but they only jump over the calves,
and it is a pleasant sight to see them on their way
to school jumping hither and thither like grass-
hoppers. The effect of this is already beginning
to appear in the gait of the inhabitants. None of
them walk upright, and there are people in the
community who have advanced so far that, in-
stead of walking round the table, for instance,
they spring over it. In many houses the door
has fallen into disuse owing to the family leaping
through the open window.

“ Tom Tin ” : Who in the name of thunder
invented “As straight as the crow flies”? Crows
don’t fly straight. They never did fly straight,
excepting by accident ; besides, a crew’s
nature wouldn’t permit him to fly straight,
if he could. The crow is a low-down scaven-
ger, and his main aim in life is mooching round.
If Hume Cook, Mauger and Trenwith had gone
straight, and not as the crow flies, they might
have retained the confidence of the electors at the
last election. Further, why “ Right as pie ” ?
Pies are not right. Given a pumpkin and a dead
dog, I will turn out 970 different varieties of
average pie. Also, why “ Straight as a die ” ? I
have used dice in all sorts of company, and of all
the cronlc take-downs known, the loaded die, or
dice with four sixes and two fives, takes the palm.
A die is not straight ; it’s a crook. Last of all,
we have “Safe as a church.” In my district we
have five churches, and not one of them has com-
plied with the conditions of the Board of Health.
A button or a bad threepence will get you into a
church; but if a panic occurred nothing short of
a miracle would get you out safely. Proverbs are
supposed to be potted meat, and, like potted
meat, they won’t stand analysis.
THE RULING PASSIONS.
BLACK BROTHER ( to motorists going 50 miles an
hour): “Say, boss, you gib it little bit ’bacca?”
“Rouseabout”: In B. 14/4/10 “ Itarx ”
draws attention to the great change that has come
over the shearer in the past 20 years. Quite cor-
rect. But what of the rouseabout ? Unlike the
shearer, he has no motor-bike or free-wheel.
Practically, he is now where the shearer was 20
years ago. He is paid a princely 30s. a week,
and, although engaged under an award which sets
a working week of 48 hours, the present system
of short runs and numerous smoke-o’s demands
that he should keep going anywhere between 56
and 66 hours a week. Briefly, he goes into the
shed at daylight and comes out of it at dark.
Working under contract, the shearer, in many
cases, makes more money in one day than the
rouseabout receives in a week, while if any ques-
tion arises affecting the working of the shed or
the accommodation, the rouseabout is treated as
just so much vacant atmosphere.
“ Vigilans ” : During my four years in
1 North Australia and North-East Queensland I
found a rubber-producing mangrove in North
Queensland and also in West Kimberley. The
same mangrove is not to be found in the Terri-
tory. Several men made a living at tapping these
trees; but the price of rubber was then low, and
there was nothing attractive in the game. The
coagulating milk of this plant is of great
resilience. In Kimberley there are immense
mangrove forests ; the north-west coast is fringed
with them. Whether they can all be “milked”
I don’t know. On the Katherine, Day and
Roper rivers the gutta-percha grows extensively.
I have tapped these trees and drawn off the sap.
This was treated as a bastard rubber, and was
marketable at about half the price of the Congo
and other African and S. American rubbers.
There is also a vine in the jungle of the
Territory that produces rubber when cut into
joints. It is scarce, however, because there
is not much jungle in the country. As to
the success of ordinary rubber cultivation
in the Territory, I have my doubts. The white
ant of those parts is a devouring monster that
overtakes almost anything which can’t get a rapid
move on it, and the movable rubber tree hasn’t
yet been invented. The gutta-percha plant is,
however, no friend of the ants, and I have never
seen the little beasts caress it.
* * * *
After 16 years’ experimenting, a Victorian
shearer, named McLeod, claims to have invented
an apparatus called a wet-wool tester, which, he
says, will settle the much-vexed question of when
sheep are too wet for barbering. McLeod, who
is now in Central Queensland, intends doing the
rounds of the sheds there this season, and will,
incidentally, exhibit his invention under ordinary
working conditions. He gave a demonstration of
its capabilities in Brisbane the other day. It
consists of a jacketed copper cylinder about lOin.
long and 3in. in diameter, fixed on an aluminium
stand, to which is attached also a shelf, on
which a small spirit-stove is placed. A bent
copper pipe is screwed into one end of the
cylinder, and the other end of the pipe dips
into a glass goblet with a graduated hollow stem.
This goblet, or champagne glass, is filled with
kerosene. To operate the apparatus the spirit
lamp under the cylinder is lighted and allowed to
burn for a few minutes, so as to drive off any
moisture that may be inside the cylinder or
fittings. Then a cap on the cylinder is unscrewed,
and an ounce of the wool to be tested is placed in
the cylinder and the cap screwed on. A plug of
asbestos fibre is placed inside the cap to serve as a
filter and to prevent any dirt or particles of
charred wool passing through the pipe into the
goblet. The jacket of the cylinder is filled with oil
to insulate the cylinder proper from the flame of
the lamp and thus prevent the charring of the wool.
A reservoir at the top of the cylinder receives the
surplus oil from the jacket when it boils. When
the cylinder is heated up a second time the
moisture in the wool becomes vaporised, and
passes through the bent pipe into the kerosene.
This condenses the steam, which falls drqp by
drop to the bottom of the goblet and passes by
gravitation into the graduated stem. In a few
minutes the drops cease falling. This is an indi-
cation that all the moisture in the wool has been
driven off. The amount of water that the wool
contained can then be read in the graduated
stem. (The graduations are marked in minims.)
The whole operation of making a test takes
about 25 minutes.
* * * *
“Pick ” : Some people have hard luck in
this country, sure enough. Take the case of
Mullaney, a neighbor of mine. Mullaney owned
the best game hen in the district; but the local
A. P. and H. Society offered a prize for a pair of
game birds only. Mullaney, therefore, searched
the town with three half-sovereigns in his hand.
and when he found the right rooster he paid
the cash, and bagged the fowl. In the bag
he had previously placed other purchases, in-
cluding some loaves of bread and a bottle of
rum. The fowl, in battling for freedom,
broke the rum bottle, and the escaping fluid
saturated the bread. Then the fowl ate the
bread, and when Mullaney drew him from
the bag he was speechlessly drunk. In fact,
Mullaney considered him dead, and, not
to be clean out of the deal, he proceeded
to pluck the bird for his next day’s dinner.
It was when the rooster recovered from
his jag, and crowed for freedom from the
recesses of the household cup-board, that
Mullaney recognised his hard luck. The
language in which he expressed it was blue,
edged with green. The bird mistook it for a pea-
cock and wanted to fight it.

“F.C.L.”: Some years ago I read King-
ston’s book, “The Australian Abroad,” and at
the time agreed with the author that the skeeter
was of no use whatsoever. But recently, during
a trip to Broome (W.A.), I found out that Hing.
and I were wrong. There I saw a Jap sweating
a staff of the torments in a most ingenious
manner. As everyone who is acquainted with
the pearling industry knows, the usual method
of drilling seed-pearls is to fix the pearl in wax
and rotate a needle-drill between the palms, just
as Binghi rotated his fire-stick in his matchless
days. The Jap’s method is to entrap a number
of the skeeters in a corrugated tank by placing in
it a bait in the shape of some short-haired, thin-
skinned animal. When a sufficient number are
enticed, the bait is removed and the skeeters are
left for a couple of days without nourishment.
At the end of this time they become so ravenous
that they are prepared to drill through a six-inch
plate in the search for gore. The employer then
shoves in a number of trays, consisting of sheets
of case-hardened steel, with taper-holes drilled in
same, of sufficient size to allow of the insertion of
pearls. Each tray has a cavity beneath, wherein
is placed the temptation to bore in the form of
shark’s liver. The skeeters, faced with the alter-'
native, of drilling or starving, bore through the
pearls. The process is rather slow, but the.
number of employees, the cheapness of shark’s
liver, and the absence of Factories Acts and
Wages Boards, makes the business highly re-
munerative.
READY MADE.
MINE MANAGER: “ Hi ! What the devil are you pulling up those corner-posts for? ”
NEWCHUM : “Me boss told me ter get a load of posts in the bush , an' these is all I could see.”
“Windy Jim”: What is that Aboliar
giving us when he says that buckjump riders are
done at 30 ? I can show him any amount of riders
about the country who are over 50 years. Take
the Blakes from the Lachlan ; old Harry Dempsey,
who has sons of 30, also buckjump riders; old
McNamara, still “breaking” at 67 ; and no end of
other good riders advanced enough to receive the
old-man pension. I myself started “breaking”
horses at 10 years, and have been at the game, off and
on, for 30 years, and will take pn anything they can
dig up at the present time. Of course, referring
to the smoked-beef tribe, they, as a rule, don’t
last long. Most of them are old at 40 whether
they were ever on a horse or not.

“ Lad ” (the original) : The pirating of
my pen-name by a person of no account
(B. 28/4/TO) has brought rhe the abuse
of “Jimmie Pannikin.” But he
will not “give me what for ” when
he meets me on the Muddybidgee
near Gundagai. On the con- A
trary, if he doesn’t apologise
I’ll push him through the win-
dow. By the way, have you
heard that “Pannikin, J.” is
likely to run as a Labor
candidate at next elections ? I
hope he does; he is the sort of
genius Australian Parliaments
need. But I hope “ J.P. ” will
not ask people to go out to live
in the Outback Paradise. The
Back o’ Beyond may be all
right for such as “J.P.” and
myself to run through on fly-
ing visits ; but I for one (and
I think “J.P.” for another)
would strongly object to put in
any term of exile in the Back
o’ Beyond with nothing to live
on except “the charm of the
open spaces, the magnificent
air, the memorable hospitality,
the gracious, spacious kindness
of the Further Out folk; the
free, wide life ; the absence of
the cant and carping criticism
6f Inback and Inside; the
wondrous fascination and the .
phenomenal potentialities of
the Cinderella country.” “ Pan-
nikin’s ” word-pictures are at
barren as the real Dreary Desolation. But what
a brazen drinking-vessel “Pannikin” is! He
spent three years in the West, with his head-
quarters at Broken Hill, and this entitles him to
call himself an “ Outback expert!”
* * * *
“Barcoo Bill”: “Bill Sticker” (B.
7/4/TO) inquires for the whereabouts of one
“Jimmy the Rooster.” Peimit me to put him
on the trail. The old chap is on the Old Age
Pension list, and spends the evening of a strenu-
ous “poisoning” career a few miles below Men-
indie, on the Tolarno side of the gutter. I had a
“ pitch ” a few days ago with him, and. consider-
ing the amount of indigestion to his credit, the
old fellow’s conscience and himself are wearing
well. While the water fried in his billy Jimmy
“put into me” many a tale told round the camp
fires of “ Greenhide Jack,” “ Never Sweat Joe,”
and other celebrities of the Never Never.
“ McGinty ” : “The Downy Bird” (B.
28/4/’10) nominates the spins' ant-eater for the
Australasian weight-lifting championship, and I
put my name also on his paper. “ Porky ” and I
first met at Hurstville (N.S.W.) some five years
ago, when he accompanied me to camp in the
folds of an overcoat. On arrival, the gin-case we
used as a bread-bin whs pressed into service, and
the capture was placed inside. The lid was then
[Secured with 2in. nails, and for greater safety a
'stone, weighing anything from 801 b. to 1001 b.,
was placed on top. However, man proposed and
“Porky” disposed, as on
paying' the box a visit the
following morning I found
that the spiked Houdini
had prized up the lid, stone
and all, and had gone back
to the simple life.

“ F.H.R.” : In case there are some who
haven’t tasted porcupine, I wish to announce that
he is good eating. Baked with a bit of pumpkin
and a few potatoes he is not too bad, but to taste
him at his best skin him over-night and soak him
in salt and water; then fry him in his own fat,
and he’s a coronation feast.

“ The King is dead," they told the Bloke ;
“ He passed away last night;
He laid aside his kingly yoke ;
No more for him the fight.”
“ Gorstruth ! ” replied the Bloke at last;
Then added, “Strike me blue,

“ Chink ” : What is the weirdest noise,
sound, or kick-up that the Bush can produce? I
hold several briefs for the call of the powerful
(or eagle) owl—the largest of its kind in this Con-
tinent. It is not really a call, because it rises
several degrees above a yell, and is perhaps best
described as a demoniacal voice-spasm. I have
known good, reliable bushmen take to their
heels and run when some of these blood-
curdling howls burst upon them suddenly.
The fowl itself is brown, twice the size of the ordi-
nary boobook owl or mopoke, and the possessor of
an extraordinarily long pair of legs. Generally
its aggressive scream is uttered when thebird is on
the wing sweeping low to the ground, the object
being, no doubt, to startle and thus locate rabbits
and other live tucker.

“Bill Sticker”: “The Lad,” who (B.
28/4/’10) professes violent yearnings to return to
the Back-o’-Beyond, is an 18-carat optimist, and
a curious exception. Present scribe has wasted
more years than he cares to remember in far-
western N.S.W. and Queensland, where “the
dead men lje,” and the live men do the same.
He’s “ inside ” nine years now, and so far has
felt no particular desire to hasten back to Mulga-
land. All qut-backers he has since met severely
lacked the same yearning ; in fact, his experience
is that, oncq safely “ inside,” backblockers decline
with great enthusiasm to rush back to the smell
and sulphur of the shearing-sheds, and the heat,
flies, ’squitoes, long distances, scarcity of work,
poor tucker, bad water, worse grog, and dearth of
news of the Far Out. The only thing that hunts
inside mep outback again is Cow! If “The
Lad” slaves on a cow farm, one can understand
his yearn. Anyone with only the ghost of a soul
would yearn to get away from Cow, even if the
only other place available was Gehenna.
“ Coki ” : Was keeping an appointment
with that necessary evil, Work, t’other day, and
whilst waiting for it was treated to a variety turn.
That velyety-covered, spike-ended quadruped
called the cat and two perky willy-wagtails were
the principals. William No. 1 was engaged in a
medley of two-step and side springs, evidently
the Bupper dance, apparently unconscious that
puss at every tail-sweep was half a tail nearer.
•Tust as I calculated on William’s final turn, Willy
No. 2 took the stage, and by his persistent
waltzing gnd floating almost on puss’s whiskers,
got his name on the latter’s programme. In a
short space they had the stalker in spasms,
wriggling at first one and then the other
till she must have got giddy with indecision. So
the music stopped with puss not having made an
attempt at a spring, while the Willies floated to a
fence near by and did a few reverse turns. For
the sample of humorously inhuman “limb-stretch-
ing ” the Willies deserved a basket of insects.
THE ENDLESS! CHAIN.
LADY : “ And what made you lose your hair? ”
BEAT : “ Worry, lady.”
LADY : “And what were you worried about?”
BRAT : “Losing my hair.”
“Leo Lear”: The pertinacity which the
small black ant displays in tracking down tucker
and bogging his unpalatable taste therein, bangs
most things. Lately, to circumvent the ant pest
I strung up a, couple of yards of wire netting,
hammock fashion, between two gums and placed
a half-consumed tin of jam in the centre. Next
day it was crawling with the vermin, which
were working in and out across the mesh
of the netting as if they were on one of their main
roads. When they can accomplish this I have
doubts about the efficiency of the ancient bush
chain trick, although to date I have never been
introduced to the ant who could navigate half a
dozen links in as many days.

“ Vectis” : If a close attention to one’s
business, to the total exclusion of all other in-
terests, is the sure way to success, then some of
the Tasmanian cockies ought to be the most
successful men on this earth. At 11.30 one night
I met Bill Jackson, who leaned against a fence
and expectorated excessively. After some in-
terpolated remarks on the price of spuds and
the drought (we had had no rain for two
weeks), he said : “ You see that; big star
there near the moon ? The Examiner sez
it’s goin’ to smash inter the moon at 12
o’clock t’-night. My oath, it’s a fact,
right enough. They wuz all talkin’ about
it round ’ere t’-day. Hoo, no ! I ain’t
waitin’ up for that. I bin out lookin’
after some stumps I’m charrin’. I reckon
I’ll git orf ter bed now. So-long.” A
.celestial phenomenon, however stupen-
dous, couldn’t materially affect the (
spud market, so why bother? Bill, by
the way, must have been misinformed,
after all, for I see the star is still there.
“Dux”: The righteous indignation of
.Tack Maori when anyone casts covetous eyes at
his “missus” is a powerful thing. One of him
recently found the course of true love running
anything but smoothly; and as he was looked
upon as an educated native, and prided himself
that he knew all about “te law,” he placed a
spluttering pen to an almost official-looking sheet
of greasy blue paper, and proceeded to warn off
all and sundry in no uncertain terms. The docu-
ment, which was pasted up outside Tim Casey’s
pub, read as follows :
NOTISE UNDER THE LAW.
Hinemoa Teringa not mine properley marry missus.
She mine greatly loved. Napere he say he want Hinemoa
one week keep the house up his place. Hape he arsk she
go way Gisbone for the long time. This the notise

“F.H.R.” : Once for all, let the artists
get hold of a real swaggie. There should be no
place for the picture of an Australian swaggie
who does not carry a sugar-bag over one shoulder.
Do these artists think that a swaggie eats grass?
Will somebody who knows
(others are requested not to butt in) tell me how
it is that a dog will not eat bandicoot, despite the
fact that he relishes native bear? I have known
man to dine well off portions of the ’coot: but dog
passes. Why ?
THE ’LOO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some poets will sing of the gloomy Outback,
Or rave about mountain and stream ;
The country, for them, is an old beaten track ;
But Woolloomooloo is my theme.
I know the back country, or did long ago,
When I was a green jackeroo,
But those days are now past and I’m settled at last
In the ’loo.
Let others to distant Suburbia flock,
And rush for tram, ferry, or train,
A ten minutes’ walk takes me down to The Block
A leisurely stroll back again.
The Pointers and Bay-ites, and other big toffs,
In motors pass scornfully through,
But I envy them not, for I’m right on the spot,
In the ’loo.
The dwellers therein are more varied than “ smart,"
All sorts and conditions of men,
From the merchant who rides in his bottle-0 cart,
To the slave of the ledger and pen.
The ladies are friendly and bid you “ Good-night,”
Though quite unacquainted with you ;
O, there’s no beastly pride or detestable side
In the ’loo.
Life’s sunshine and shadow are here to be seen,
Its bitters as well as its sweets,
The grave and the gay and the dull in-between,
You’ll find in its numerous streets.
See, there’s a poor woman turned out of a house,
Her few sticks the sidewalk bestrew,
No doubt it's a shame, but it’s all in the game
In the ’loo.
Let Ashfield be swagger, and Mosman be nice,
And Edgepliffe exclusive and swell,
They probably harbor as much human vice
As you’ll find around where I dwell.
We don't “ pntertain we just shout in a pub ;
That’s all we can do on our screw ;
What we are we appear—we’ve no use for veneer
In the ’loo.

A LONG TASTE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twas Brogan's bar at Take-Your-Hook.
A droving stranger drifted in,
And most superior was bis look.
“ A drink !” he snorts. “ Your rum is crook.
Your whiskey’s awful. Gimme gin.
“ I had a beer here, goin' through.
Disdainfully I never speaks
Of any fellow’s booze, but you
Keep quite the most infernal brew—
I tasted it for seven weeks ! ”
Then forward started Tally Jim—
“ Here, Mister Lan’lord, quick,” he says,
“ I’m goin’ north, beyond the rim ;
Gimme a beer like you gave him—
-1 shan't he back for fifty days ! ”

No notice (except of a, hostile character) will be taken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MSS. No liability is under-
taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent by post or handed in; and no MS. will be
returned unless stamps (of any State) accompany.
B.N.F. : No; if the par. is built on information
you supplied, it’s yours. But it'sometinies happens that
another man supplies the same information, and that his
par. is printed ; then it’s his E.W.D.: All right; there
was such a common Roman remark as “It is sweet and
honorable to die for one’scountry.” But that isn’t exactly
the same as that is good to die, which was the maxim
the B. said didn’t exist Enquirer : Don’t know ; we
hear mingled curses and blessings.... R.B. : No; go
either direct or through a literary agent Watts : Must
have approximate date.... Walla : Cut out printed pars,
mark with date and page and post to the Accountant.
A.C.A. : The “Asche Hash ” verse hurt us, but we’ll
try to forgive y0u....H. A.T. : You must get in earlier if
you want to catch the ’bus. That particular vehicle
turned the corner a fortnight ago... Cawarree : Yes, we
do; but we have the same taste in stories as in oysters.
And we feel very much the same, too, when we have
unsuspiciously swallowed a stale one A.J.W. : Yes;
two... .E. Strong: D. Weak Meßrown : It’s not letting
out a secret to remark that “ the more experienced bush-
man ” you mention is identical with the writer whose
remark you want to put an axe into ... W. Johnston :
Quick and Garran’s Annotated Edition of the Constitu-
tion is best.. .Sapphire S. (Q.): Both still under con-
sideration. ... P.F.G. (Q.): Only tinkling rhymes....
R. 5.1.8. : Nob up to prjnt level.. ..Wylocrety : Dreary
imitation of an inane song now being sung by one of the
most lamentable comedians that ever struck Australia.
L.S.B. : Swamped by false rhymes and other bad
faults ...H.C.8.: Don’t doubt you for a moment; but
where should we be, without evidence, if the man
dropped in with a writ ?.... R.M.N. : That’bus has gone ;
mid the poem is too weak to catch it... Hireling'
Clever; but Ed w. Hugo : One good verse in the
hymn of the Queensland parsons :
Bless Ye also Willie Kidston —
He who picked the happy day
When the people’s thoughts were centred
On a more engrossing fray ;
He must carry out our wishes,
Or with candle, book and bell,
In our wrath we will condemn him
To the lowest pits of H—l.
.. . .0.A.G.: The verdict went against it after some slight
hesitation B. Whitlow: The comet yarn isn’t skilfully
enough done. The omission of page 7, with its heaps of
dead bodies, improved it, if anything A.M.: No; the
last line holds all the humor, and we don’t feel equal to
rebuilding the whole shaky four-verse edifice because the
roof parapet looks rather nice... .E.A.W.H. : Vigorous
but rough Gaul: Commonplace... .Leo C. : You are
right; it is not up... .L.J.C. : A commendable first at-
tempt, but it is some distance below print level.... Mr.
Nysh : We don’t want the ragged, tempestuous poem,
but would like to know what the dot ted breaks in the
lines are meant for. Did you intend the vacant spaces
for advertisements? W.P.: Unsuitable N.E.S.: Can-
not use that trifle.... Lela M.: The humorous rhyme is the
better of the two ; but even that falls short. Other is
commonplace... .Mopoke: The racing yarn is too long
for the interest. The pub story is ancient... .F. A.R. :
Rough work ; also, the text was used last week in “ Plain
English.”.... W.S.: Yarn is being held for a final reading...
G. W.G.M. : Batch of verses received. In what foreign
country did you meet the “pretty peasant” milkmaid
with the bright eves and the red cheeks who “ tripped
down the lane”? O.C. : The triolet is smart and
dainty—as all good triolets should be; but haven’t we
met it before? Other poem is a stranger, but not worth
while.. ..P.M.J. : The verses are mostly commonplace....
0-T. (N.S. W.): Your comet poem splutters out like a
damp rocket... .Yevez: It is humorous, but only in a
faint, timid way G. W.G.M. : Of the second batch this
one homely verse appeals to us :
John Brown, John Brown of Ballarat,
Whatever must you do,
Living in an alley,
And a dirty alley too ?
If you can always manage to be as simple and direct, and
hot quite so personal, you will do. (P.S. —We have
altered John’s name and address for obvious reasons.)...
An Dante: You send vour poem on Halley’s comet from
gaol. But it must have been a previous offence that
you were gaoled for. . W.E.A. : Write Sydney Law
School, Phillip-street, City Jacko: Thanks; but it
looks rather too much like helping ourselves to butter.
.. . Unarel (Tas.): Both poems jolt heavily in places. It
is rough work, but not hopeless F. Smith : The push
poem is a great darkness, and requires a lot of consider-
ation. We will look at it again later R. W.: Judging
by the sample forwarded, you had better not forward the
rest of your stock. It is quite unsuitable A.M.W.:
“ The Pill ” fairly well compounded, but we can’t take it.
Lupus: A dull drunk story Bobs: The Irish
rhyme is a hobbling imitation of the type of hilarious
poem that jigs along for a mile or so and ends in a joyous
ruction. Minor rhyme iscommonplace George Eden :
Your verse is a bit rough; but this is worth handing
aloiig:
I have read a deal of Nonsense
And a little maybe true,
I have met the sights and sorrows
That the rovers mostly do.
But I think I’ll quit the business,
Leave my books upon the shelf,
Give up all thoug-hts of teaching
And just learn to know myself.
....Lakaloi: Considering the Bosun... .F.G.: Story is
only mildly humorous. Your pen is rather green just
yet W.H.F.: Two uninteresting tragedies in red ink.
There is, however, a touch of the novelty about this
ending:
Marie almost whispered. “ Am I your wife?”
“ I mean it,” said Daniels ; “ 13wearyou are my wife
“ You lie 1 lam your widow ! ” she screamed.
And a smoking revolver lay in her hand.
... .F. Bush: Cnarley rambled into the basket
H.C.W.: As an aged visitor who calls in only at long in-
tervals, Halley’s comet is deserving of our protection.
We, therefore, decline to allow you to bother it with
addresses, illuminated or dark Non Vi : Utterly hope-
less.... John J. M.: Far better to write to the Postmaster-
General.. ..W.R.M.: Ingenious ; but too late.

A new sentence has now to be kept stand-
ing for use whenever the oldest inhabitant of 90
or upwards dies—“he [or she] lived under six
monarchs.”
According to Australia’s official historian
Knibbs, the first systematic rainfall observations
made in the continent were carried out at Ade-
laide by Charles Kingston’s father, George, better
known as “Paddy.” He was Colonel Light’s
assistant in the survey of Adelaide.
The S. Aus. Labor party contains two ex-
Methodist parsons with a hope of a seat in
Verran’s Ministry—Senior and Styles. Senior
nowadays is an orchardist; Styles, since he left
the pulpit, has put in most of his time trade-
organising—the Butchers’ Union is his chief
trophy.
The reappearance of a George on the
throne recalls that on December 28, 1836—the day
S. Aus. was declared a British province by
Governor Hindmarsh—the first and flustered
Colonial Treasurer (Osmond Gilles), who started
the National Anthem, began with the words
“God save Great George our King,” although
William IY. had then been on the throne for
six years.
Maoriland’s new Governor, Islington,
takes with him. as private sec., a Boggabri
(N.S.W.) native, named Robertson Clark, whose
father is a squatter with a station rejoicing in the
name of Ghoolendaadi, which sounds like an
Indian tea plantation. His mother was a daughter
of “ old Jack ’ Robertson. Less than two years
ago, young Clark, then in England, married Lady
Beatrice Moore, only daughter of the deceased
Earl of Drogheda. She goes with him to lOU-
land. Clark served his apprenticeship to his
present job with Govs. Beauchamp and Ravvson
in the Ma State.
THROUGH THE NEEDLE'S EYE.
SYDNKYITE (on being admitted into Heaven)
“Yet they said my character wasn't good
enough to gain me admission to the Mitchell
Library! ”
The prevailing impression among those
who had the best opportunity of studying George
and Mary when they were in Australia, is that
the reign of George V. will be the rule of
Mary 111. Mary—then “May”—was always
fresh and always interested throughout the
I ederation celebrations ; but George never seemed
to get his eyes quite open during the whole of his
stay, and had an air suggestive of nerves and
melancholia. When they were seen together in
public George could not hide the evidences of his
moral dependence on Mary ; there was always a
lean towards her—a furtive twitching of a nervous
hand in her direction. The Prince’s better-half
really seemed to be about four-fifths.
“ Snob ” : I claim the clergy. Everyone
allows that King Edward was the perfect gentle-
man in every sense. But the clergy won’t be
satisfied without claiming him as the miracle of
piety. They Temind me of Chief Justice Madden.
At a Salvation Army shivoo he said : “ I am one
of you ; I’m a soldier in your army.” Vociferous
shouts of “ Holler-looyah ! ” That week he had
been to a ball, to the theatre, and to the races.
For any one of these offences a common redskin
would have been drummed out. Are there royal
roads to Heaven? Now, put away these things !
Say that the King came naked into the world and
goes out naked. This is the really powerful atti-
tude for clergy to take, not smoodging. Louis
XIV. sneered at the priests for cockering him
up. He said : “ That poor little Jesuit Soanen is
the only one who tells me the truth.”
“The Snake,” on the N.S.W. Govern-
ment’s Shocking Example:—
Speaking at the N.S.W. Licensed Victuallers’ Associa-
tion picnic at Sydney last week, Treasurer Waddell spoke
his usual good word for liquor. Waddell is the only man
in the present N. S. Wales Cabinet, as far as I know, who
ever kept a bottle of something in his office in case of an
emergency. I have had a good deal to do with the Ma State
Ministers one way and another —sat for dreary hours lis-
tening to cow-brained deputationists; walloped hard
into fast interviews ; hung around the doors waiting for
the Mikado to say, “Nothing to tell you.” And, hot or
cold, none of them ever seemed to have a human thought
bar Waddell. I waited to see him for half an hour one
wet day when I was “ sopped and wringing!” “You’re
in a nice state,” he said when I got into his room. I ad-
mitted it on the evidence. “Sorry I can’t give you a
change of clothes,” he went on, “but I’ll warm you as
well as I can. Will you have a glass of whisky?” He
brought a bottle from his cupboard, and there and then I
gave him absolution for all his political sins. He never
ought to be in that crowd.
There are two members of the episcopal
bench in these parts who have mounted to the
steeple-tops of their churches. Bishop Julius, of
Christchurch (M.L.), had himself hoisted up in a
chair a distance of 200 ft. ; and. sitting in the
chair, he duly laid the top stone of the steeple of
his cathedral. It was not real steeple-jacking, of
course ; but the performance needed some nerve,
and his Gaiters had it. The other “jack” was
Dr. Camidge, Bishop of Bathurst (N.S.W.).
When stationed in England he climbed the steeple
of the tabernacle of which he was rector, and did
it, too, in true steeplejack fashion. In this case
something had gone wrong with the spire ; and,
there being no professional steeplejack in the
parish, the rector turned his feet and hands to the
service, and got nearer to Heaven than many an
archbishop has ever been.
A belated send-off :
Launceston (Tas.) went to the funeral of one of its most
interesting men the other day ; later on it will read W. F.
Petterd’s name on the tombstone. Petterd, Tasmanian-
born, was an indefatigable scientific investigator. As a
collecting naturalist he was well known, and the scien-
tific results of his expeditions in Eastern Polynesia (in-
cluding the Solomons) and in British New Guinea (he
was one of the first party of explorers to get into the
N.G.' interior) were numerous and valuable. He was one
of the naturalists with the “Chevert” expedition fitted
out bv the late Win. Macleav, of Sydney, and did exten-
sive dredging for natural-history specimens on the Barrier
Reef and in Torres Strait. He also spent considerable time
in Queensland and northern N.S.W. getting exhibits
for European museums. His collection of minerals
(which he has left to the Launceston Museum) was pro-
bably the most extensive private lot in Australia
—it contained over 20,000 specimens from all parts of the
world. In addition to his scientific interests he was
intimately associated with the development of the mining
industry, and particularly with the West Coast silver-lead
field. And as well as being a scientific enthusiast he was
pre-eminently and simply human, a genial soul, and a
charming companion.
When George V. made his ducal tour of
Australia and Maoriland, a few years ago, the
authorities, bearing in mind the shooting of
uncle Edinburgh by the madman at Clon-
tarf (N.S.W.), took precautions for his safety
by giving him a bodyguard of
about a dozen picked detectives.
There were three from N. S.
Wales (Roche, who is now De-
tective Superintendent, Rochaix
and Murdoch), three from Vic-
toria. two from South Aus., two
from Queensland, and one each
from WestrHlra. Tasmania and
Maori land. The business of these
caretakers of Royalty was to
mix with the crowd at garden
parties, balls, levees, banquets
and such shivoos, marking the
guests and keeping an open eye
for the fanatic who didn’t put in
an appearance. Sergeant Wilson,
of Victoria, travelled on the Royal
yacht, and stayed wherever the
Duke stayed, his particular job
being to watch out that nobody
stole the jewels. The heir wasn’t
afraid that anv assassin wonlrl
deprive him of his turn with the sceptre ; never-
theless he took his bodyguard very kindly, and
at parting gave each officer a signed picture of
himself and another of “ Victoria Mary ” wrapped
up in a cheque for £l5.
Strutt’s long, low, gloomy painting of the
Victorian bush-fires on Black Thursday has, it
seems, found a home at last. How it originally
got to Adelaide is uncertain, but for 30 years or
so it has belonged to one Wivell, a dancing-
master, and his executors. It was always for sale
when it hung in his salon, and many attempts
have been made to dispose of it; now, at last, it
finds a private buyer at Glenelg. The Art Gal-
lery of Adelaide refused it, though it is in a
public collection that it ought to be.
“ Snell ” on the boy who was always old :
Here, in Melbourne, the daily papers never mention
the first visit of George V. to Australia without referring
to him as “ a merry sailor lad,” and chortling over his
breezy manner. They must give a newer generation an
impression that George went through Australia eternally
hoisting his slacks, and that he commonly danced
frivolous hornpipes on the highway, and drifted about,
with a roll in his gait and a quid in his cheek, chucking
girls under the chin, a perfect burst of joy, like a Blandolt
tar in a briny drama. I saw George several times during
that tour, and he struck me as a remarkably sober youth.
There was nothing whatever of the saucy sailor'about
him. He had that tired look, strongly accentuated by
the heavily-lidded eye characteristic of his stock. When
I beheld him at “Commonwealth time,” the weary
Duke, with drooping spirits and lack-lustre orbs, was
just such a man as I had expected such a boy to grow
into.
After about 50 years’ service, November 9
disappears as a public holiday. George V.’s birth-
day was June 3, and his eldest hopeful was
thoughtlessly born on June 23. Two holidays in
June in Australia are a poor substitute for one in
November, though Melbourne will be better off—
it will still have its Cup.
A RELIABLE HUNTER.
AUSTIN : “ Looks a good, safe hunter you have
there , Yellerbec.”
Y ELLKRER : “ Yaas. positively safe — won't jump
anything.”
By cable, from London, comes news of
the death of the widow of William Busby, of
Redleaf, Double Bay (Sydney), a former king-
time M.L.C. of the Ma State. The Busbys are
an ancient people in N.S.W. Away in the ’2o’s
there were three of them living at what is now
called Darlinghurst; and in 1827 one of them,
John, a surveyor,. commenced operations for the
construction of a tunnel from “ Lachlan Swamps ”
to supply Sydney with water. Of course, the
city wasn’t reticulated ; but there was a standpipe
in Hyde Park, near St. James’church. The work,
which cost £24,000, was a success, and “Busbv’s
Bore ’’supplied Sydney with water until 1857.
An old Australian family has hopes of
having a saint to hang on its “ tree ” ; for a com-
mittee of investigation has been formed at
Rome to initiate proceedings towards the
canonisation of Oliver Plunkett, one-time
Archbishop of Armagh, Ireland, who was
killed in the bad old days. Australia’s first
Attorney-General under Responsible Go-
vernment, John Hubert Plunkett, was a
member of this Oliver Plunkett family,
and carried with him to Sydney a large
number of Plunkett family treasures.
When he died he left his pecuniary
affairs in a sad tangle, and pathetic appeals
were made to Parliament after Parlia-
ment on behalf of his widow for an
allowance in recognition of the public
offices he had held, and for which he had
not drawn allowances he was entitled to.
Tom Slattery had almost engineered her
ciaim to success when the tall, slim, black-
draped old lady so well known in William-
street and Darlinghurst passed away.
Most of the Oliver Plunkett relics, which
John Hubert carried to Sydney, were pre-
sented by Mrs. Plunkett, the widow, to Car-
dinal Moran, and are now in the Cardinal’s
residence, in Manly. Many of them are reli-
gious, but there is among them a gold watch well
worth examining by makers of modern timepieces.
It shows that Oliver had a taste for the pretty
as well as the pious.
An Australian, a Beechvvorth (Vic.) young
man, came to a strange end recently at the
mining town of Castana Nueva, in the Argen-
tine. Having dropped some pebbles down the
chimney of a “dug-out” wherein some Italian
miners were singing, he looked down it to see
what they thought of his joke. Just at that
moment one of the revellers fired a revolver up
the chimney by way of being equally funny, and
a bullet entered the head that blocked the open-
ing. Some men are born to trouble, others have
trouble thrust upon them. The poor fellow who
went looking for it down a chimney was probably
unique.
“ J. 8.” on the Wowser controversy :
It is hard to tell when you really have a Wowser. Yo
might think that every red-hot teetotal Methodist par-
son bore the brand. But you would be wrong. There
was the Rev. Frank Isitt, the present organiser of the
M.L. Alliance. At the time I write of he was secretary
to the No-License party, and, as editor of the party’s
publication, he had a place in the Parliamentary press
gallery. There were some hot bloods amongst the
•‘specials,” and four o’clock “tea” was the rule. It
was also the rule that each man in turn paid
the bill, and Isitt went into the line regularly.
On the first occasion when it was his “ shout ” we all
agreed, out of respect for his views, to drink tea. “Sing
out your drinks,” said the man who was making out the
list, and “Tea,” “Tea,” “ Tea ” came from all round the
pressroom. Frank Isitt looked at them with a smile at
the corner of his mouth. “Gentlemen,” he said, “I'll
take it kindly if you will not put yourself out to oblige
me. It’s very good of you, but I’d feel more comfort-
able, and I know you would, if you’d have the usual.”
And we did.
A man with a past interviewed the Ballarat
beaks lately on account of a charge of excessive
insobriety. The sheet called him John Franklin
Dermoody. Forty years ago this Dermoody, then
a youth of 20, escaped from Ballarat gaol with
bushranger Moonlight, afterwards hanged at
Darlinghurst for murder. In reminiscing after
his discharge, Dermoody hinted that he had
mostly led a wild life ; but, having acquired a
wife and family, he proposed to follow the narrow
track and eschew the pint pot. Also, he proposed
to seek the consolations of religion and turn over
several new leaves. After which no one was much
surprised when the police had to help him to the
lockup the same evening on the same old charge
Archibald Michie, whose widow died at a
great age the other day, could never keep long in
any one groove. He arrived in Sydney soon after
being called to the Bar in England, bringing with
him a light rapier pen and a headful of ideas, and
soon he found himself stabbing through the
pages of Robert Lowe’s Atlas. That paper,
though small, un-
dertook to treat
every subject on
the earth, and
above and below
it. It was just
what Michie want-
ed. When Lowe
threw up the
Atlas Mic h i e
made back to Eng-
land, and rushed
the press with im-
pressions of Aus-
tralia ; then back
South again, and
rushed the editors
in Melbourne with
impressions of
England. But edi-
tors were unsym-
pathetic ; so, as
his ideas were
burning holes in
his head, he deter-
mined to unload
them into a paper
of his own. Ac-
cordingly he took
over the Mel-
bourne Herald,
then a morning
journal, and ex-
pressed hisfeelings
till his pockets ran
dry. Finding; that
to print his ideas
was expensive, he
resolved to throw
them on the air ;
so after the Bal-
larat riots he en-
tered Parliament,
where he soon became Minister, and afterwards
Agent-General in London. He returned again to
Australia, and closed his restless life doing odd
jobs for the London Times and others. With
much more than average intellect, he jumped
about so much that he failed to “dent” any par-
ticular spot deeply. A duller man, standing still,
would have “ dented ” some spot much deeper.
The widow of the first Treasurer under
Responsible Government in N.S.W. died last
week in England, aged 89. Thomas Holt, her
husband, was, however, a politician only inciden-
tally. The pioneer Government lasted only from
June 6, 1856, to August 25 of the same year, and,
though Holt sat in the Lower House 10 years
longer, he never caught another portfolio. His
first motion in Parliament was “ That the Speaker
on taking the chair shall henceforth read the 67th
Psalm.” He had as a woolbroker exploited Ger-
many and Spain, and spread himself over N.S.W.
industries with the same intention ; but he wasn’t
altogether successful, and went back to England,
where he died in 1888.' The family’s place was
the Warren, at Marrickville, on which he spent a
mint of money; when he left it became a convent.
THE POOR PROPRIETOR.
The award of the Federal Arbitration Court in the case
of the marine stewards lays down a principle which now
appears for the first time in the administration of British
law. Its effect, briefly, is that when a “tip” is given to
a servant he must pass it on to his employer. —Daily

The old trouble arising out of a Judge
having a son for a barrister is turning up again
in Melbourne. Guy Madden is practising now ;
,and the fact that he was on the winning side in
the recent Harbison will case, heard by pa
Madden, has made the Edgar party more deter-
mined than ever to take the thing to an appeal.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I mean to have a good time when I get to Heaven
When I get through the pearly gates and I have kissed
mv darling wife, and heard the Salvationists shout
Hallelujah,” I am going to ask Peter whether I can’t
have three months’ holiday.— General Booth.
Oh ! ’Eaven is a long Benk ’Olidye,
A glorified ’Ampsted ’Eaf !
Give Peter the wink in a 'aughty wye,
Go in smokin' a penny leaf,
Find yer donah an’ kiss ’er ’ot,
As yer mooch by the golding Frone ;
Darnce all dye wif yer little lot—
Tike care that yer mike ’er known.
Two peacock’s fevvers mus’ be in yer ’at
As y’ walk froo the pearly gytes ;
For ’Eaven’s a place wot’s used to that—
An’ the Ine-gels like the sights.

VICTIMS OF OBESITY.
CURE YOURSELF AT HOME IN COMFORT.
As a bodily affliction obesity often seems to be
inexplicable, so rapid is the increase of weight and
bulk, even in cases where the victims are studiously
temperate in eating, etc. There is evidently a
predisposition that way, and neglect only tends to
confirm it. The remedies tried may have griev-
ously disappointed you. Here is one that will not
do so, and you may get the ingredients at your
chemist’s and mix them yourself without trouble.
Ask for one half-ounce of Marmola, one ounce of
fluid extract of Glycyrrhiza 8.P., one ounce of
pure Glycerine B.P. and Peppermint Water to
make six ounces in all. Shake together in a good-
sized clean bottle. Simply take this mixture after
each meal and at bedtime, two teaspoonfuls to
the dose, and give yourself no further trouble;
the superfluous fat will subside with wonderful
rapidity. Dieting need not worry you in the
least, nor is violent exercising at all desirable.
Wasting methods of weight reduction are nob
natural. Try the pleasant treatment above pre-
scribed for a week or so, and you will be fit, strong
and free from all bodily discomfort, besides having
regained correct weight and a shapely figure.*

Eczema Cured.
“I had e.czama on the arms for six years,”
writes Mrs. Waller, 575 Boundary Street, Bris-
bane, Q. “It was so bad, that if rubbed, I would
scream with the pain. I tried both internal and
external remedies without results, until I used
Rexona, which cured me and left my skin so that
a baby might be proud of it.” Price Is. 6d. and 3s.*
An old man sat in his padded arm-chair
In the ingle nook, with a weary air ;
And he saw quite plain that his days were done,
For him Life’s race was nearly run.
As he coughed and wheezed in the same old way,
Woods’ Great Peppermint Cure was brought that day
Now he walks about like a juvenile
Quite well and strong with a happy smile.*
BAD FOB THE SKIN.
0
Rubbing on Greasy Ointments,
How tc Properly Treat
Skin Troubles.
It is not a goon thing for people with a tendency
to have pimples and a blotchy complexion to smear
themselves with greasy ointments and such things.
In fact they couldn’t do anything worse, because
the grease only clogs the pores of the skin, making
the complaint worse. When there is an irritating
rash a soothing horaeic wash may help to allay
the pain or itching; but, of course, it doesn’t
cure. Skin complaints arise from an impure con-
dition of the blood, and will persist until the
blood is purified. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pdls have
cured many cases of eczema and skin disorder,
because they make rich, red blood that drives out
the impurities, and imparts a glow of health.
Mr. Robert Davies, of 43 Rathmines Street.
Northcote, Melbourne, tells how these pills cured
him of a terrible attack of eczema.
“ I had a bad attack of eczema,” said Mr.
Davies. “My poor body was quite raw. I could
hot bear anyone to come near me. I was under
the doctor for 12 months, and he couldn’t cure me.
My .skin used to burn and itch something fright-
ful. I was on fire with it. No one knows how I
suffered, only my wife and myself. I spent pounds
and pounds in medicine, and none of them did
me much good.. The trouble used to appear on
the thighs, and on the calves, and most particu-
larly about the ankles. My clothes irritated the
parts dreadfully. It was impossible to keep
from scratching ; my skin used to scale and come
off like scurf. I was suffering like this for about
a year when I read that Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
would cure my complaint, and so I bought some
and took them as directed. After awhile the
irritation began to decrease, the skin got less
scurfy, and more healthy looking. I felt better
than ever I did. To-day I am perfectly cured,
and my skin is as clear as it was when I was born.
I can eat and work, in fact I am a new man.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
Vic. Lands Minister McKenzie will shortly
travel to Europe to look for settlers, and will
leave Treasurer Watt in his official shoes. Cer-
tainly, Watt is already Knight Commander of the
Petty Cash; but he can easily crowd in all that
there is to do at the Lands Department. There
are no lands left'to speak of—only landlords.
Wertheim, the one-time piano importer
and Freetrader, sold his first Australian piano to
the Ivanhoe (Vic.) A.N.A. theotherday. The
instrument looks good, and Wertheim promises
that it is going to be good. The boss frankly and
cheerfully puts the new industry down to the
high tariff, which has turned a German into an
Australian, and a German wage-roll into an Aus-
tralian ditto.
A N.S.W. proclamation last week stated
that “his Excellency [Chelmsford] directs salutes
of 68 guns to be fired.” Did he now? Where,
precisely, are the guns that any Australian State
Governor or Government controls or directs in
this part of the world—or any other part, for that
matter ? It takes a long while for some people to
find out that there is a Commonwealth in exist-
ence, and that the Defence Department belongs
to the Commonwealth.
It is astonishing to find that there is
actually something not known to the Wadewood-
waddle Government—the existence of State pubs.
Speaking at a picnic, Waddell, the N.S.W.
Treasurer, told the assembled Bungs that “the
proposal that the Government should take over
the liquor business, and make it a State concern,
emanated from flippant men and women . . . the
proposal would not bear investigation.” Wouldn’t
it? Ask the Westralian Government about its
excellent pub at Gwalia ; also, ask Wade about
the State pub at Mt. Kosciusko.
King O’Malley probably didn’t say it;
but the Sydney papers sav he said that, though
he was utterly opposed to Yassberra, nevertheless
now that he is Minister for Home Affairs, and
now that Yassberra is the law. he is going ahead
with Yassberra. On the same principle, when
the Labor party arrives in power in N. S. Wales,
and finds Wade’s Coercion Act on the Statute
Book, it will presumably proceed, not to remove
the thing it doesn’t believe in, but to enforce it
and shoot in a few more trades unionists. If the
present Federal Government is going to leave
laws as it finds them, and merely enforce those
laws, what was the use of changing the old
Government ?
Speaking at a smoke concert at Dandenong
(Vic.), Iceberg Irvine recently declared that the
system of old-age pensions was already sapping
the manhood of our young men and taking away
the incentive to work. When a responsible poli-
tician, hailed by his constituents as “the future
leader of Australian politics,” states that young
Australians are losing the incentive to work
because, under certain conditions, they will get a
pension of 10s. per week when in the sere and
yellow leaf, he becomes a plain, ordinary libeller
of his race.
John Murray has been over in Sydney,
talking finances to Wade and parables to the
press:—
“Have you ever attended an aboriginal dinner?” he
asked. “No? Well, if you had you would probably see
the old man squatting on his haunches feasting on a fat
opossum, and as he tore it limb from limb, and stuffed
the fleshy parts into his mouth, he would shy the raggy
hones over his shoulder to the poor lubra, who, maybe,
had caught and cooked the opossum, and who stood
patiently behind waiting for any morsel her lord and
master might care to throw her.”
“ I see,” said the reporter, “ the old man Common-
wealth and the lubra States! ”
“Just so,” said Mr. Murray.
John Murray’s little parable is all wrong, though.
There isn’t a nigger and six gins. There is just
one nigger. But because that nigger has two
legs and two arms and two ears, Murray thinks
he ought to have six mouths —one for each limb
and two Over for the ears.
A MEDICINE OF REAL WORTH.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is intended for
acute throat and lung diseases, of which colds,
croup and whooping cough are the most common.
Those who have used it for years and are in a
position to know its real value assert that it is
without an equal for the treatment of these
diseases. It not only cures colds and influenza,
but counteracts any tendency towards pneumonia.
It is in almost universal use as a prevent!ve and
cure for croup, and has never been known to fail.*
The new issue of the Antiquarian Gazette, just
received, is by far the best journal of its kind issued in
ibe Commonwealth. It is now in its fourth year, and
contains articles from the days before the Flood up to the
Australian aboriginal and early colonial times. Arclue-
nlogist Isidore Kozminsky, the well-known scientific
antiquary with an alphabet of letters following his name,
is the editor, and the office is in Block Place, Melbourne.*
From the Old Soldier :
The Fusion’s Defence Minister Joe Cook, who thought
“River” boats were a species of barge for use in creeks,
has just shown that his military knowledge is as mag-
nificent as his naval ditto. “Had I been continuing at
the head of the Defence Department,” he told the re-
porters, “the idea was to bring out from England a
couple of young directors, who have gained their know-
ledge at the Staff College, who could bring to us the
latest' word as to the best method of imparting the re-
quisite instruction to our officers here.” So the brilliant
military authority imagines that the Staff College is a
place where young men qualify for first commissions,
like Woolwich, or Sandhurst, instead of a place where
experienced regimental officers of several years’ service,
few of them under the rank of captain, qualify for staff
employ. It is not a training-school for teachers, oraschool
at all, but a place where it is ascertained whether a man
can apply the knowledge he has previously acquired.
Since the Federal elections Wade has
been in such a state of blue funk that he won’t
dare to positively refuse anything these times.
After promising to rush on railway duplications
for the purpose of relieving the railway muddle,
he found out that the country wasn’t satisfied —it
saw that the bigger the traffic the bigger the
muddle would probably be at the Sydney end as
long as everything was dragged to Sydney. So,
to wriggle out of that difficulty, and serve both
his god of the city and the mammon
of the country, he has promised a Com-
mission to inquire into the question of rail-
connection between the tablelands and the out-
ports. But the country will turn a glassy eye on
his Commission-shelving scheme. It will remem-
ber that a Commission was appointed to select a
site for a Federal capital, and that, when the
Commission reported in favor of the Monaro, the
Wade crowd jumped on the document enthusi-
astically because a Monaro capital was “no good
to Sydney.”
FOR LUCK.
Wade isn’t the only person anxious to air
his little dignity during these days. Mary Jane
Gould, President of the Senate in the last Parlia-
ment, and Carty Salmon, Speaker in the House
of Reps, in the last Parliament , rushed forward
“on behalf of Parliament” with a loyal address
to George V. They might have had the decency
to wait till the Houses assembled and did some-
tiling for themselves. There is no warranty that
these two gentlemen will be reinstated; in fact,
things look quite otherwise.
Wade can rely on one solid hunk of sup-
port in September or October. During, his State
Frights tour of the North Co'ast he was often
asked whether he intended giving any more terri-
tory to the Hindus ; and he declared so much in
their favor that they are now writing fulsome
eulogies of their friend “the Honorable Mr.
Wade’*' in the open columns of the Northern
Star, Wade’s sheet-anchor at Lismore. Prem
Singh in a recent issue accused the whites (who
'asked Wade the anti-Hindu questions) of being
“semi-civilised,” and lauds the “Honorable Mr.
Wade for saying that, as British subjects, the
sons of India have a perfect right to settle on
the dusty and inhospitable soil of Australia!”
But on the ground that a politician can be told
bv the people who barrack for him, probably even
Mr. Wade begins to have doubts whether the
enthusiastic support of Ram Box is going to do
him much good. He might even lie pardoned for
wanting to put his coffee-colored friends where he
put Peter Bowling—anyway, till’the elections are
over, and his friends can’t injure him with their
support.
Said George Reid to the Birmingham
Chamber of Commerce last month :
Australia has the right to make tremendous prepara-
tions for a danger which may never come.
It is diverting to recall that this is the same
George Reid who, last April, to the uproarious
joy of what the Sydney Telegraph described
next morning as “a record gathering of repre-
sentative patriots,” said that Australians, like
Andrew Fisher, who advocated making “ prepa-
rations for a danger which may never come, ’’ were
acting the part of “ disloyalists ” and “ dingoes ” ;
and that the only thing for sane patriots to do
was to send England a Dreadnought and let local
defence go to blazes.
“The Plough boy ” : Although thousands
of Victoria’s farmers have left that land-locked
State and trekked away north, John Weary
apparently cannot find enpugh earth-crust for the
men and ploughs still available. At any rate, for
139 Mallee blocks for which applications were due
last week the papers report that there were
“about 600” distinct applicants. It reminds me
that last week I was hailed by an old Victorian
friend in tne agricultural machinery business. Of
course, I wanted to know what he was doing in
N.S.W. The Southerner replied that he had
come over to find farmers to sell machinery to,
and that he intended to stay for good, or until a
land-tax forced the Victprian land monopolists to
do something with their, idle paddocks. He told
me that his firm had watched the farmers going
north until it had growp desperate and sent him
after the flying yeomanry with a disc-plough in
one hand and a harrow in the other, and a reaper
and binder under his arm. He was a very dis-
gusted Victorian indeed, for his southern home
was broken up just as badly as if Socialism had
kicked for three weeks vyith both its hoofs.
The Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney
could, if it liked, say a word qr two just now
about the way White labor in the sugar business
has smashed North Queensland, as the black-labor
crowd was sure it would. In the ’nineties the
bank put up new premises at Mackay, a town that
is built almost entirely on sugar; I and the disaster
has been so complete that the co. is just now tear-
ing the place to yiieees so that, it may give the
ruined growers more room to come in and look at
their overdrafts. The railway station has also
been extended lately : this was’ to accommodate
the capital that'was being driven out of the
district. No less than 300 extra cane tracks have
been also put on the various mill-lines ; but that
has been done out of pure cusse<juess.
* Private Enterprise hasn’t got quite to the
point at which it claims the moon when it hovers
over Private Enterprise's back yard ; but things
are getting on that way. El wood Mead, the Vic-
torian irrigation expert, was lately hurried up to
Queensland to take a swift glance at irrigation
possibilities there ; and, though he didn’t think
much of them at present, he recommended the
State to take steps to stop ttje awful waste of
artesian water. Thereupon the Pastoralists’
Ass. at Longreach has met in an agitated frame of
mind and resolved to “strongly protest” against
any steps to “regulate the flow of the existing
bores.” or any Government interference with
future boring. Since, however. Governments
everywhere do “interfere” in the case of rivers,
and thus conserve the rights of people lower down
the streams, the Longreach Ass. will have a
pretty hard job to persuade the State that it has
no right to “interfere” in the case of under-
ground streams as well.
The difference ! Cabled that on June 18
next (Waterloo anniversary) the new King will
review 20,000 Boy Scouts at Windsor. On the
same day the fourth son of the Kaiser will launch
the new German Dreadnought, Ersatz Frithjof,
of 20,000 tons, and built to carry 12 12-inch guns
and a battery of small quick-firers. This is the
first royal inspection of Boy Scouts. It is Ger-
many’s eighth Dreadnought.
Wade will be able to get a lot of comfort
out of the reason the North Coast (N.S.W.)
cockies give for appealing to him to hurry up.
The Macleav Advancement Association has
passed a resolution that, “ owing to the probable
Labor victory in this State next September, the
Wade Government be called upon to immediately
call for tenders for the Taree to Kempsey section
of the railway, and to start building as many
bridges over the tidal rivers as possible.” No
doubt Wade will promise to do it all. He even
promised the other Premiers that the Financial
Agreement would be carried.
Premier Weary and Willie Watt, having
talked over the recalcitrant Tories in the As-
sembly, have got the Victorian fusion in working
order once more. The present understanding is
to slip in with a “modified ” land-tax, and go no
further with the State coal mine than Parliament
has already authorised. That is, so far as the coal
mine is concerned, the Railway Department is to
be allowed to raise its own fuel—at a cost of about
14s. a ton in Melbourne —while the suffering
public is to be left to the mercy of that Private
Enterprise which charges 225. a ton in normal
times, and 455. when there is a strike or lock-out
to help it.
N.S. W. Treasurer Waddell pooh-poohed the
nationalisation of the Bung business, theotherday,
because it would cost £12,000,000 for compensa-
tion. But when the Government decided to run
railways, it did not order all the stage-coaches
over the country to hand in their licenses. It
took one road after another, running its own
lines, and it got there without paying any com-
pensation whatever. When John See was
Premier, “Wully” Affleck introduced a deputation
from the Presbyterian body desiring that the
Government would, while reducing the licensed
houses in the Rocks resumption area, make a
start on the pubs by establishing State control
over the six hotels retained in the area. See
declined, but that Presbyter an deputation’s re-
quest was a practical suggestion for a beginning
in nationalisation ; and, the beginning once made,
it would be easy enough to find ways of con-
tinuing the job gradually.
Premier Wade, of N.S.W., has gone to
a lot of trouble lately to persuade the public that
his Coercion Act didn't abolish trial by jury. All
through he has spoken with the air of one who
was shocked and hurt by the accusation that he
had assaulted the trial-by-jury principle; cer-
tainly, not even in his wildest moments did he
think the principle deserved to be assaulted!
But Wade has enthusiastic supporters, one of
whom is T. Henley, M.L.A. ; and T. Henley has
been talking in the papers:—
Leaving out of consideration any special set of cases,
the whole question of trial by jury requires attention.
No man with capital or a stake in the country can be safe
under the system. . . . We hear too much prating about
the jury being the first principle of British Justice.
Now, what does Wade think of his supporter,
T. Henley, the gentleman who evidently wants
to abolish the system because “no man with capi-
tal or a stake in the country can be safe” (from
gaol, presumably) while it is in existence?

Tight in his Ministerial chair, nursinga bored and languid

The Presence sits, with tumbled hair, and thinks ori

And though the works of Progress hum, though slow and

Moves to a day of wrath to come, he sits there, thinking
things, and dumb.
He thinks on things, or so it seems, revolving most tre-
mendous schemes ;
Genius beneath his eyelash gleams—unless, mayhap, he
only dreams.
And yet, though Tory temples crash, though old and new
opinions clash
And lightning-bolts of Progress flash, the Minister does
nothing rash.
Warming his Ministerial chair, he sits, with cobwebs in

Those who suffer from falling hair, or, in fact,
any hair troubles, should find out about the Hygeia
Individual Treatment, which absolutely cures where
those advertised remedies fail. Miss 8., of landra, whose
hair was dry and split and falling badly, whose scalp was
very irritable and covered with dandruff, writes, after
using the treatment only one month :
“lain very glad to say there is a great improvement
already, the irritation has already quite gone and nearly
all the dandruff, the ends are not at all split, and
altogether there is a great improvement. My hair is
beautifully soft and quite glossy, and there is a lot of
new hair beginning to grow. It is not falling out at all,
and has no appearance of doing so. I hope to be able to
call and see you in a few weeks’ time, and then you can
se e for yourself the great improvement in my hair. ” —E.B.
The President may be consulted, free of charge, any d iy
but Saturday, between 2.15 and 4.45, and on Wednesday
between 6 and 7. Those who wish to know more about
this treatment and cannot call, may write, enclosing 3d.
stamps for booklet and many more testimonials, to the

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney. Mat 17, 1910.
Mr Dear Artnt.—
So it is to be “ Queen Mary,” after all! Well,
“it’s a grand old name,” as Grace Palotta used to
tell us, but what unfortunate associations it
recalls! There hasn’t been one truly lucky or
happy Mary in the royal book of fate. Mary
Tudor, with only one husband and one kingdom
to manage, succeeded in cramming as much
unhappiness into both her public and private
doings as Mary StuarUdid with her three hus-
bands (to say nothing of Rizzio). and her unlucky
shots at being Queen of three kingdoms—France,
England and .Scotland. Then Mary 11., if re-
port speaks truly, wasn’t too domestically happy
with the dour William ; also she had no heir, and
was haunted by a sense of treachery to the
family cause. Being a Stuart, the poor thing
was born to ill-luck ; so perhaps she was resigned
to it, and didn’t mind so much.
At this moment, though only a small knot of
cranks say so, there is actually another person
whom they designate “The Most High and
Mighty Princess Mary, by the Grace of God
Queen,” etc. There was a long account of her
only a week or two ago in one of the illustrated
papers. By right of direct Stuart succession, this
Mary (I don’t know what number she has arrived
at in the dynasty) is claimed by the Neo-Jacob-
ites to be the rightful Monarch of England. Of
course she’s not, but still the account of it all
makes very amusing reading. When her lieges
call on her they say “ Your Majesty, ” and crawl
out backwards, after kissing hands and going
through characteristic grovels. She is married to
a Bavarian bigwig; I forget the name of her
domain, but these Schwearwalds and Donner-
steins sound all alike. Stuarts are somehow very
fascinating. As failures, they made a greater
success than most personages do who come out on
top. Probably for that reason Victoria was ex-
tremely proud of the drop of Stuart blood in her
own veins. Of course the aforesaid were all
Queens-regnant (omitting the Bavarian lady),
while our own Mary queens it solely as Consort
to George. So let us hope she will change the
luck of the Marys, and have a good time.
Walk up George-street from the Quay and you
will see all degrees of tristfulness. Lower Geoige-
street doesn’t show its mourning much. Here
and there a black band, caught in with purple, is
draped across the shop window. But the parade
increases as you get nearer King-street, until the
city thereabouts becomes a veritable wail ex-
pressed in knots and festoons.
Said a shopman to the undersigned, when in
quiries were made about the all-pervading topic
of mourning : “ This time the mourning is much
deeper, and —please remember he was a shop-
man— “ shows much more respect and sorrow than
it did when Queen Victoria died.” The old lady
teas an old lady, and there was nothing unex-
pected about her death. King Edward’s passing
came as a shock—to Australians, at any rate —and
“mourning” is much more general. Besides, it
was such a very long time between funerals when
the old Queen went that the populace had com-
pletely forgotten how to publicly show signs of
grief.
The drapings that will adorn our buildings till
the end of the month are certainly' much more
artistic than the former ones, which turned, after
a few days’ wear, into flimsy black rags flapping
drearily against stone and brick. In the present
outbreak Government House, the Water and
.Sewerage Office and the Post Office take first
place in public estimation. “At first,” said my
shopman, “black sateen was used, and purple
likewise. Then the decorators decided that no-
thing glossy was suitable ; so cashmere was sub-
stituted, and the city is hung with miles and
miles of it. Art muslin ? Oh, that wouldn’t stand
the vveather for a week. One Pitt-street firm that
is doing the bulk of the Government work kept
going night and day to get everything ready by'
the end of the week. But it will be Monday
before we are all ready ” —this was last week. He
observed that the stuff will be useless bv the time
it has served its purpose, and will be destroyed—
the weather will damage it beyond possibility of
after-use. The warehouses ran out of purple
cashmere; hence the scarcity of that hue in the
later drapings.
Mourning a monarch at 6d. a time can’t be
called indulging an expensive luxury of grief.
Yet this is what it is costing many a private
mourner to show respect for the late king—and,
incidentally', to be in the fashion. Black is “It” at
present, and the daring woman, clad in colors,
who enters a tram or boat wherein are seated
other women is glared at in a way that makes her
as self-conscious as if she were wearing a hat of
the y'ear 1. So all the old black frocks have been
overhauled. Unlike the public trappings of woe,
private grief is thus expressed on an economic
basis. “This is the gown in which I mourned the
King’s mother.” said one careful soul to me
recently, proudly displaying a well-kept black
silk. To serve as mourning for two monarchs is
quite an eventful sartorial history. Then as to
hats, a sixpenny' bottle of hat-dye transforms any
chapeau. You needn't even untrim the hat; the
colors must not be allowed to garishly display
themselves from under the black, and all is well.
Blacking mother’s hat affords a morning’s amuse-
ment for many a happy family party. Thereafter
mother appears, and the head of the female side
of the house is “in mourning,” and all the more
pleased about it because it has “Cost practically
nothing, dear.”
“tic suis du Midi,” said Calve at the Australia
one morning soon after her arrival, and that
phrase just describes her. She is triumphantly 7
“du Midi,” from that warm South that breathes
of “dance and Provengal song and country
mirtn.” There is an entrancing picture in the
Gallery, “ The Grape Harvest in Provence ’’; if
you get the idea of that well into your mind, you
will feel the atmosphere that envelops the
singer from that land which is not unlike
Australia for sunshine and warmth. The
chat was run on Ollendorfian lines, for
Calve speaks “ Eenglish vairy leetle,” so she
chatted amiably' in her French, while the inquisi-
tive person who was worrying her for facts in the
interests of this letter kept wisely to the “Bon
jour” and “Oui, oui ” end of the conversation.
“ Also present ” was tenor Gasparri. I give him
front rank in this chat because Calve did so. She
is delightfully non-professional and unassertive.
“ Me? Oh, I have been singing always,” she care-
lessly asserted. “Chiefly I love the songs of my
native country, in their own Provengal language—
old songs that the people of the South have sung for
years. It is those I like best to sing. But I
should like you to tell about Gasparri. He is
Italian. He has had a great success in leading
Italian cities, having created the tenor rdles in
‘ The Butterfly,’ ‘La Tosca ’ and ‘ La Boheme.’ ”
Gasparri looks the sort they make matinee idols
of—a soulful-eyed, pale, romantic, handsome,
slender and youthful tenor. He will be adored at
sight.
Calve is chesty ; but her eyes are dazzlers.
Dark and liquid, they beam and flash and sparkle
and do all the attractive things you read about
but very seldom see where eyes are concerned.
Her manner is no manner at all, which is the
best: no mannerisms nor affectations—the sort of
“way with her ” that takes with women as well
as men. Clad in creme serge, braided with silk, a
large, black-velvet hat with feathers, and a sable
boa, she showed half mourning.
The last week-end she spent in being wafted,
per motor, to National Park, the Blue Mountains
and other beauty spots, and the car was then
waiting to take her on her jaunt. “Sorry at the
French Consul postponing his reception?” she
echoed. “Oh, no; how could it be otherwise? One
is very, very sorry for the cause; but the mourning
must be kept. It was better, too, that I should
postpone my opening concert until after the
funeral. Yes, I liked Melbourne very much. It
was not cold there ; but here—it is a glorious
climate ! I love the open air ; it is so good for the
voice. Now I am off for a whole day out of
doors.” Except when she said that the last
time she sang before Queen Alexandra was
last year, the Voice did not come into the
versation. Aveyron was Calve’s birth-place;
Carmen is her favorite rble. But you have heard
all that before. Nevin Tait, who sidesteps would-
be bores in the Australia entrance-hall while his
star is upstairs, states that Calvd is keen on seeing
the harbor from a rowboat, as she is an expert
oarswoman. Well, if they get her a nice
roomy boat
News comes that the Dudley twins are doing
their best to keep the family well in the public
eye. When their mother saw them on her re-
turn to England, after a year’s absence, she could
,not distinguish little George from tiny Edward.
Only their nurse knows t’other from which. It
took Lady Dudley several days, it is said, “to
get used to them ” and recognise one from the
other. The boys, who are now two and a half,
are named after their royal godfathers. A photo,
by Rita Martin, a fashionable woman camera-
artist, shows them to be delightful little chaps,
exactly the same size, and clad in the sweaters
and knitted pants which most youngsters of their
age wear. They look what nurses call “pickles.”
But they have beauty—it is hereditary in that
family. The twinnies remain in England.
Friday was the final night of the Opera Co.,
and the theatre was crowded to hear the last of
“ Carmen ” and say “ good-bye ” to the artists.
Quite friendly were the numerous calls and cur-
tains. The youthful Pampari has made many
girl-chums in Sydney. Fannie Bauer gav,e her a
cosy little cm r.evoir tea-drinking last Thursday,
which modest festivity was the sole social event
of the week of gloom. Some musical people
assisted. Calve smiled from the d.c. at “Car-
men,” and most in the house recognised her at
once. The eo. departed by the Ulimaroa on
Saturday for Maoriland, amid more than the
wonted enthusiasm and violets and things, Bel
Sorel throwing flowers at all and sundry.
Matlieson Lang and Co. are busy at rehearsals
of “Pete” at the Criterion. On Sunday he and
Mrs. Lang, otherwise Miss Hutin Britton, made a
Sabbath day’s journey to Tom Ugly’s Point and
beyond it, and thought it all very beautiful except
for the mosquitoes ; whereat yours truly, who was
talking to the pair at rehearsal, gave a hollow laugh,
for the mosquitoes are supposed to be “over” in
that sylvan retreat. But the local mosquito will
always find out the new-chums, even if he has
to travel far to do it. M. Lang is distinctly
“ fetching.” It would be nice to see him as Ham-
let, and we may. He is the mould of form, to
start with. The couple spend their holidays
yachting on the Norfolk Broads, which is as
far away from civilisation as they can get in
the Tight Little Island. Miss Britton wears a
pinafore and cooks breakfast, and her husband
eats it and shoots duck. They both graduated
with the Benson co., wherein one actor plays
many parts, and so gets a thorough training.
Mrs. Lang began as an amateur, and then studied
seriously at the Royal Academy of Music. As
regards the marriage, “Fate threw us together,”
said the lady. (It often does.) They were con-
tinually engaged for the same cos., and under
Ellen Terry’s aegis they became engaged to each
other. Miss 8., or Mrs, L., whichever you
please, is a handsome, well-set-up girl, and he is
one of the leading “ lovers ” of the stage.
The baby for “Pete ” is growing as fast as the
somewhat limited time at the infant’s disposal
will allow ; but he will be all right on Saturday
night. He was made a real little Christian of one
day this week, called Pete, and godfathered by
the Stage Pete. So as Pete Howard he figures
correctly on .the bills.
Mr. Lang, who" toured America with Mrs.
Langtry, says that she is the pluckiest woman at
fighting age he ever met. She is nearer 60 than
50, yet still thinks nothing of a 10-mile walk, and
can stoop and touch the floor in front of her with
the palms of her hands without bending her
knees. She has still traces of beauty, but is not
at all popular either in or out of “ the ” profession.
Teresa Carrefio arrived on Monday with hus-
band Tagliapietra, two daughters and suite. The
Marama brought them. Celebrities are pouring
into our city. By the same boat came Miss Grace
Edmond, for “ The Dollar Princess.” Also,
Dolores is due here quite sooh. After the mourn-
ing is over we shall be having a distinctly lively
time.
“ How to be Interviewed ” might be the title of
a lecturette, given by Miss Grace Edmond, the
new Dollar Princess, at the Wentworth Hotel on
Monday. “In Brisbane,” said she,the press-
men came onboard the Marama to interview me,
and, would you believe it, they asked for facts 1
Why, 1 was quite surprised. In the States the re-
porters just come and say they are real pleased to
see me, and we chat about the weather arid books
we’ve read, and all sorts of things; and they ask
me one or two questions ; hut/acts ! I'hen,
next day. appear two columns full or lovely
things i haven’t said about Art and Music,
and long accounts of my life and doings.
Fancy wanting facts!” After marvelling some
more on the guilelessness of Australian reporters,
Grace (who, thanks he, is not yet 21 and looks
about 16) told of the bad luck the comet brought
her. She and another girl turned out of their
berths to see it yesterday morning, and as they
were up they huddled up under some rugs to see
the sun rise, when suddenly decks were washed
down and they were deluged by the hose from
above. “ Comets always bring bad luck,” is her
reflection. “Momma” Edmond is chaperon for
Grace, who is pretty enough to need one. She
(Grace, not momma) is fresh and vivacious, and
has never before been out of America.
May Summerbelle gave a tea-party on Monday
at The Towers, Maequarie-street, whereat a com-
pany of musicians of note assembled in honor of
Yvonne Leverrier, one of the number, who was
billed to face the matrimonial music on Wednesday
(18th), the captain of the Pacifique being the
lucky man. Everybody said all sorts of nice
things to, Yvonne, whom everybody knows.
Everybody was in sombre garb, and nobody
played or sang.
“ Chanticleer” hats have been taken out of the
windows wherein they were proudly perched.
Many shops displayed them, but the fanciful mil-
linery has been displaced by the mourning, and it
is very likely that the boom is dead. Show-
ing how these crazes are very often worked from
the inside, the story (it is no doubt a chestnut) is
told of a French woman-novelist who worked up
a fashion and the sale of her book by going into
shops and asking for a hat “ d la Valerie.” or a
gown “it to Valerie,” and when the puzzled shop-
men declared they had never heard of the style,
she affected haughty surprise at their ignorance.
She ran in several of her women friends to perform
the same task, and the end of their endeavors was
a veritable “Valerie” boom.
Some clever youths in Melbourne about .a
decade ago thought of the same trick. They
brought out a little illustrated paper, The
Rambler, and they, their sisters, cousins and
aunts used to go from bookstall to bookstall asking
for The Rambler. It ram bled for about six months,
and then ceased meandering altogether. Norman
and Lionel Lindsay were two Ramblers, as likewise
was Norman’sbrother-in-law, Raymond Parkinson,
whose death, to the great regret of his Sydney
friends, has just occurred at the Dalby Sana-
torium. Ray Parkinson was a talented journalist
whose specialty was the illustrated article. He
was sub-editor of the Calcutta Englishman for a
few years, and came back to Australia with shat-
tered health. On the Evening News for a while
he did good work in giving first-hand information
about the Indian trouble, but had to give up the
pen, though he fought a plucky 7 fight to the last.
Dr. Elkington, Health Officer in Queensland,
who visits Sydney this week on Congress busi-
ness, married another sister of Mr. Parkinson’s.
The contralto hunt which Mrs. Reginald Qups-
nel: held about this time last year resulted in the
disbovery of a voice worth training, the possessor
of the organ being Miss Lvall Hine. The lady
who used to be Miss Margaret Thomas heard her
sing last week after a year of scholarship, liked
her voice immensely, and advised her to keep
right on.
An innovation in the stereotyped wedding
arrangements, and one which ought' to recom-
mend itself especially to the 'impecunious bride-
groom, is to have a “best girl” instead,of many
bridesmaids 1 . A recent bride with a double-
barrelled name set the fashion in London, being
attended by her “best girl” as the bridegroom
was by his “best man.’’ The best girl stood'at
the altar waiting for the bride, for whom she per-
formed all the little services which the principal
lady requires during the progress of the ceremony.
Only one girl to give a trinket to will be one re-
sult of the new notion. And as long as the bride-
groom doesn’t call the maiden his “best girl,”
the bride will feel quite happy.
Kosciusko enthusiasts have formed themselves
into a ski-ing club, and held a meeting on Tues-
day of last week, at Challis House, to consider
plans for getting up sports amid the ice and snow
of our only Alpine resort, and giving prizes there-
for. They say that ski-ing grips you like drink-
ing or the morphia habit, and the Government
hospice is already booked a full house for all the
winter season. The club is going to hand out
some good gauds, including a silver clip.
The glide is coming into our midst again.
“Prunes, plums and prisms ” are again in vogue.
This is absolutely certain. Manners maketh
man, but clothes make the woman. The kicking
strap which now ties in the skirt below the knees
regulates the steps of the wearer. Striding is ifn-
possible. With the glide must be adopted a
manner to match. Quiet and retiring girls will
now have their day. The slangy and swift type
has moved too quickly. She will now stride out
of the picture altogether.
Strange are the ways of committees when
charity balls are under weigh ; and in working
up the revel hardly a committee-woman goes un-
scathed and gets through without the arrow of the
snubber rankling beneath her outward calm.
Recently some heated feeling resulted in a com-
mittee room over a tiny matter which a healthy-
minded babe would pass over as too trivial for
notice. Sectarianism was a handy missile, and it
was thrown. “We know why this was done,’
said one who felt aggrieved, “and the Cardinal is
at the back of it.”
If it wasn’t the Cardinal, it must have been the
comet. I would not say this out loud for the
world ; but what a lot of dreadful events have
happened since that mysterious star with the tail
showed itself! It makes one feel thoroughly
creepy to gaze up at it and think that very same
comet was in the sky when Atti a died, and again
when the needlewomen worked it into tne

There are more things hanging to the passage
of the Veto Bill by the British Honseof Commons
than a mere Budget. The cable mentioned a day
or two ago that “ the Government has done its
best to compile a list of possible peers, but is
still 300 short of the requisite 500.” It is revolu-
tion. no less. Hitherto a British lord, however
disreputable or hard-up, was a Somebody. If he
wasn’t particularly elevated, either on the intel-
lectual or the ethical side! he, at any rate,
had the value which attaches to rarity. His

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, Mat 16, 1910.
My Dear Yarrik, —
The times are unspeakably depressing, and are
growing more so as fast as dressmakers and shops
can turn out the garments of Woe. Half-mast
flags drip in the rain, and black drapings flap
drearily and raggedly in the wind. One club
has gone to the length of having its doors blocked
in black in the shape of a coffin. Presumably all
gambling, whisky and gossip have been declared off
in that institution.
Do feminine creatures ever mourn nakedly ?
Overheard this colloquy the other day in a shop :
“I’ve just got a blue tailor-made, and it suits me
-—and now I can’t wear it! ” “ Oh, my dear ”
in a voice heavily laden with sympathy —“not
for three weeks, at any rate!” The shops are
clearing out every black rag they possess—a per-
fect orgy of clearing sales at very special prices.
Black and purple just now have a famine value,
and women are rushing unhappy husbands into
immense bills for the smart colors that denote
grief and desolation. The most insincere form of
mourning to date is the gorgeous purple or black
evening dress —the garment built for frivols and
gaiety.
“ Yes,” said another maiden, plaintively—illus-
trating the quaint turns that grief takes —“ I’m in
mourning. But I can’t show my loyalty without
showing my legs. My stockings are the darlingest
things in black and purple silk. See ! ” She dis-
played the Stockings of Grief with a discreetly
coquettish lift of her skirt, nodded good-bye, and
hurried off in search of afternoon-tea and frivolity.
A small Sassiety matron with excellent claims
to good looks has carried her exposition of Court
mourning to what looks like widow’s weeds. Yet
hubby is still at hand and most obvious. While
the present outbreak lasts he must feel rather
superfluous.
In London, Court-mourning will be necessary
for a year —here we are to be let-off with
a mere 12 weeks. Official announcements
dictate the matter. One cannot go in for
a city lunch without a mourning band
being included in the menu. The serving-girls
are black-gowned, and sombre black bows
perch on everv stack of hair. Shops show even
black and purple carpets in their funereal
windows; and one enterprising firm has
black-edged teacups and plates. The German
bands eschew the latest comic-opera tinkles, and
puff instead depressing dead marches. All effective
enough and impressive for one day—but it be-
comes an irritation as days go by and the hol-
lowness of most of it becomes visible. Weeks of
it, with wintry grey skies, will inevitably produce
a reaction.
The matinee for the Women’s Hospital bazaar,
which was to have been held on Monday, has
been postponed indefinitely. Efforts were made
to arrange it for Thursday ; but the weary actors
si ook their heads, and remarked that they had
another benefit matinee at the King’s on Tuesday
as well as the regulation afternoon on Wednesday.
As Friday was the players’ last appearance in Mel-
bourne this season, the dejected organisers had to
abandon the idea. So now the Hospital affair
must depend on the kindness of newcomer mum-
mers, or else go flat as a bust motor-tyre.
The new King made a good start in asking the
London managers not to mourn too long with
closed doors and idle players. No matter how
binding a theatrical contract is, it is annulled in
r/t,e case of a trouble of the present kind. Closing
up might be good business from the managers
point of view, for the houses are likely to Vie
affected for some time to come ; but it was mighty
hard on the poor player.
Hugh Ward 'began his season on Saturday with
a bumper house, and many people were turned
away from every door. The congregation was
mostly clad in mourning; but mirth prevailed in
spite of the weeds. Grace Palotta, as a rakish
voting ladv addicted to a ’Murkan Maxim’s,
'made her first entry in a “suit” (as American
girls say) of squashed-cherry color. Or it might
be crushed mouse ; anyway, it was some most
fashionable, glad color. She topped that with a
blaok turban which tipped over one eye and broke
out into the ecstasy of a mighty white
osprey. Next time she wore a black turban
with a demure blue rosette to take the
place of the feather. The smaller turban is worn
with a mole and blue creation. Ruby Baxter
makes a corner in greys. She walks—or, rather,
sidles —on in a grey suit so tight round her
mechanism that she is practically a mono-leg.
Liter, she frees herself into waving crepe drap-
ing, also oloud grey. Celia Ghiloni sweeps the
Wrds with a brooade of the boudoir wall-
paper type—pink roses and an ivory background.
Celia "also hits the feminine part of
the house very hard with a black lace
that fits over silken softnesses of white, Maud
Chetwynd, who has given over wheeling a pram
demurely about the St. Kdda sea-front, dances
on to the stage again in Rosie Musgrove’s place.
She skips around in black with dainty white
filings, and gets one dance into the mad hurry-
sorambl© of a, vaudeville turn, which is suddenly
shot into the wedding drawing-room. Maud
Ohefwvnd, Tilly Wood lock and Florence Redfern
make a scarlet trio who whip into the joyous
whirl of things with a care-banishing dance.
Most of the quality are not going to theatres
just now—not until their best mourning comes
home, anyhow—but enough of the crust was scat-
tered about to give the pie a look of completeness.
Hetty Muret, who is now Mrs. McEvoy, is just
back from a world four. She perched in the north
box, decorously dressed m the deepest Parisian
black. Mrs. Hugh Ward and Mrs, Brennan
watched the show from the manager’s box. An
extensive half-moon of the tribe of Abraham held
the circle, headed by that most artistic Abra-
hams who collects the pictures of the looal genius.
A niece—also Abrahams —came up from the
stalls where she was located. The lady is a “ just
returned,” and with her come the latest thing in
motors and a chauffeur who is warranted to knock
furlongs off any local petrol-burner on the Vic-
torian roads.
Wirth wisely did not ban his skating carnival.
The rollers would have rinked in any case; and,
besides, they had their glad rags ready for the
frolic. It is a beautiful skating field, that Wirth
rink. Non-rinkers were packed like figs all
round the promenade and in the balcony. On
the composition “ice” there must have been quite
a thousand, and all in fancy dress. A big case in
the entrance, full of silver prizes, gave a fillip to
the incoming rinkers. “ Pathe Freres stalked
about as a weird monster chook with pampas-grass
feathers. “ The Lone Hand ” skated beautifully;
woolly bears held aloft the letters of the name,
and on the lady’s white frock were printed vivid im-
pressions of the human paw. There was a prize
for a new Two Step, originated by Mr. Wirth
himself. And herewith I enter Mr. Wirth for
the ballet-masters’ competition ; for the Wirtn
Two Step was a thing of smoothness and grace
and an immense improvement on the former
kicking action.
The rolling fraternity are getting things to a
fine point of perfection. Not only can they waltz
and two-step and cut figures, like ice experts;
but Wirth has now a regular weekly night tor
hockey and baseball, when humans on ball bear-
ings dash about as confidently as if they weie
playing in spiked shoes on turf.
We pass on to you Sydney folk, with our kind
regards, the flapper ballet in “ The Dollar Prin-
cess.” It is well worth a special reception. Six
girls—really young girls—who seem to dance for
the sheer joy of dancing. One, a dark-eyed
sprite, is Lena Hendricks; then there is a fair
youngster, McQuoin, and two Bradleigh sisters.
The fourth and fifth are pretty girls,
and for the nonce nameless. They all rehearse
with the natural enthusiasm of joyous youth.
In the final act of “The Princess” these girls
put an amount of abandon into a dance with
Gilbert that would save even a dull piece from a
sad end, and rushes this bright show to a hilarious
climax. We also pass on to you Gilberts eyes.
If Gilbert were cast for the role of a funeral
mute, the'brilliancy of his eyes would kill the part.
Dorothy Court is shortly fading back to FoglamL
and Miss Grace Edmond is to inherit the lead.
The Greenroom Club —aged two years spread
itself in a matinee at the King’s last Tuesday.
All the theatres supplied mummer material.
Anderson’s people put in a couple of acts of “ Ihe
Village Blacksmith,” that truly rural tale ; and a
herd of Williamsonians helped to make things
merry. Clayton got himself into suitable
scenic surroundings and a khaki kit, and
rollicked through “ Mandalay ” with a khaki
chorus. The programme was unique in a way,
since all the visitors did special “turns”—
things not on in the Melbourne shows. Lottie
Sargeant, in a tricky frock and furs, wandered on
and told stories. Then the Meynell and Gunn
people took the limelight. Maie Sydney, in a
Juliet dress, warbled exquisitely. Eugenie Dug-
gan Anderson, after her two acts as the black-
smith’s wife, retired to her box buried m
polar furs, and joined Mrs. Architect Pitt, while
Cromwell pranced about in “ Little Billy Brown
from London.” The Opera House sent up a con-
signment of other frivolity; and, generally, the
programme was packed as tight as the house.
Finally, some cheery person connected with the
Greenroom Club came on and thanked the house
for coming.
With the roller rinks flourishing like evil-doers
in a naughty world, it was not likely that the
Glaciarium would be left to cinematograph show-
men through the winter. The Glassy is to be put
under the ice again next month, and the frozen
floor will be opened to the public on the 11th
proximo. Then will the artists who glide on
blades commence to drop occasionally into the
rival establishment on the opposite side of the
road, and turn up their noses at hard-working
folk on wheels, whilst the multitudes that neither
glide nor propel themselves will feel utterly out
of it all.
Little Benno Scherek is once more dodging
about Collins-street. Carreho is in the back-
ground, and the manager is waiting discreetly for
a Calve exit before pouncing in with advance
advertisements.
Maie Sydney, who is a downy little birdlet for
a prima-donna, had her twenty-first birthday on
Friday. The University students were to have
had their Night at the “ Arcadians ”; but
that is put off till the blackest edge is
off the mourning. The little girl was patently
disappointed. Twenty-one is never caught again ;
and there was a supper frivol to follow, too.
Mamma Peach had stayed over to grace a box at
the theatre and one end of the table at the supper.
The 21-vear-old leaves the Grand on Mamma
Peach’s departure, and will nestle in the protec-
tion of the Whitings. Maie Sydney got her
chance in London by the illness of Lily Elsie,
who was unable to appear for a week. That week
the clever little understudy made the very most of.
Una Bourne concerted on Thursday night in
the Athenaeum. She played the Sonata Pathe-
tique, and put a kingdom of feeling into Chopin’s
Funeral March. It is a continual wonder to most
people how the fair, slight girl manages to roll
the tone she does out of the concert grand. It
seems impossible that the drooping fair figure in
the clingsome white frock can be making the im-
mense instrument thunder and storm. Still it is
a familiar miracle. When the wonder-working
Una was off, Russian baritone Ossipoff hit out
some forcible Russian melody, and the Dolinsky
lady-Russian quavered in a twittering tremolo.
Johnny Meagher (whose syllables slide into
Johnny tnarr). a slim young man with gilt edges,
collected 20 pals at the Savoy last week to cele-
brate his 25th birthday and £90,000. The bill was
considerable, but it didn’t trouble Johnny, and
you could hardly see the scratch on the pyramid
of gold. The lucky youth belongs to a family who
have squatted long and profitably in this woolly
country and filled up many a cash-box. Johnny
has now been rewarded for being 25 by getting a
few cartloads of this wealth.
The girls with the prettily-tinted names of
Gretchen Leschkau and Fiabola Tuomy have
formally closed their show at Arcadian Cole’s
gallery ; but a good many of the pictures will be
left hanging there to wait for purchasers. While
the artists were on the spot the red label, which
is a lovely note of color in its way, appeared on
divers frames in sundry places ; so it seems that,
from a commercial point of view, Cole’s Gallery,
in Collins-street, is not the worst “pitch” in the
world for exhibitors. All the same, a pair of wily
males would ha ve done better wi th the same material
in the same room. As traders the two girls were
simple little innocents. Some of their most sale-
able goods escaped the red label through being
ineffectivelv framed —as, for instance, “Moon-
light, St. fcilda Pier,’’ by Miss Tuomy—while
clever things like “Government House” and “A
Foggy Day ” (both by the Gretchen girl) were
hung in an out-of-the-way corner. The painter’s
art is one thing, and a talent for hitting the public
in the eye is quite another.
A farmer in muddy Gippsland doesn’t believe
in letting the family miss any chances that come
along. So when he read in his local paper that
the comet could be seen from Warragul, he got
his whole family up at something to four in the
morning, and drovo mother and the boys and
girls into Warragul to see it. It was a 12-mile
drive ; but the sight was worth it, he says.
Poor Grace Jennings Carmichael! A meeting
to help her three laddies out to Australia was
convened by the indefatigable Miss Catherine Hay
Thomson ; and on May 11, at the Town Hall,
various scribes and other personages heard some
more of the sad life-story of one of Australia s
sweetest singers. But of the worthless husband
who deserted her and her children, leaving the
mother to penury and the boys to charity, nobody
could tell anything. In any case, it wasn’t any
use wasting money to look for him ; the thing was
to get the children out of the poor-house and set
them on their feet in Australia. Mr. I rank
Russell, the solibitor, made an offer to provide a
berth in his office 'for the eldest lad, Geoffrey;
and he and his brother, who are partners, pro-
mised to make the boy a present of his articles.
Somebody else offered to adopt the second boy ;
so, altogether, the movement to rescue the kiddies
looks very promising.
A Hobart correspondent tells me about the
eclipse, for which three or four score scientists
(more or less) tripped to the south end of the
island. The principal party of scientists made its
observations from the top of Mount Wellington.
A drag took the lot to the Springs, which is some-
thing less than two-thirds of the way up to the
top. There the drag was to wait till five or half-
past five. But five came, and 5.30 went past,
and then six and seven, and still the party
hadn’t got down the track that creeps up
to the organ-pipes which aren’t so very pipey
when you get there. About that hour the
driver reckoned it time to go exploring. It was
dark enough now, all right. But Jehu found the
gazers; they had been too busy looking at the
heavens to take stock of the track, and had got
adrift. On the road up, the cheerful way in which
the scientists had thrown millions about made the
driver gasp. A comet travelling a mere 70,000,000
miles or so an hour was spoken of almost disre-
spectfully. But going back, Jehu had his
turn. He was hungry and thirsty, and the horses
thought there was no place like home, and between
driver and driven a speed of seven or eight miles
an hour down the mountain-side was presently
reached. Then the scientists who had talked
airily of a speed of seven.millions of miles going
up blanched at the actual presence of a mere
seven miles coming down, and implored the driver
to modify the breakneck pace. He did; but he
was so hungry and dry.
From “ Rosna” in Adelaide :
Our proposed autumn gaieties are not to be. Likewise
Adelaide’s winter frockery seems doomed to blush un-
seen and waste its sweetness on the moth-balled air.
First, the summer was afraid to go home in the dark,
and took to lurking round after hours, so that cool
chiffons were our only solace. And now, owing to the
passing of the King, all festivities have been turned off
at the meter, and there’s no place to wear our winter
triumphs so that the other cats will see them.
Positively everything is off except the roof. Vice-
royalty is out of work. The Pageant of Fashion, which
was to have gladdened our sight this very week, and in
which her Excellency and the twins had three fingers, is
postponed until the '3sth of goodness-know-s-when. With
sighs and groans 140 disappointed maidens have packed
140 gorgeous chiffons in 140 band-boxes under 140 spare
beds.
The University ball has also rolled away, and dancing-
enthusiasts are out looking for it in the highways and
hedges. They will be unable to find it before the 20th of
June.
On Monday the Conservatorium Orchestra was to have
wailed us a special brand of classic noises in the Elder
Hall; but that has been silenced with the rest, and will
not resound until some weeks later. In fact, you may
wake us in three months from to-day.
The Birthday Cup was broken in the general upheaval;
but its remnants were gummed together somehow. When
this letter Was starting over the railway track (last Satur-
day, to be exact) various steeds were probably grappling
for it at Morphettville ; but I can’t be certain. The
Goodwood Handicap bolted blackly over the same land-
scape on Wednesday. The stands and jockeys had black
bands round their arms, and all the smartest gowns were
sombre. Mrs. Tom Barr Smith was in a pale grey
braided raiment and black toque ; and her pretty
daughter wore a cream Russian coat and skirt. There
was a cream-clad Milne girl wit h black furs and a black
beaver hat ; and Mrs. A. J. McLachlan was in grey, and
was also black-hatted. There were others too numerous
to mention.
On Thursday afternoon Mrs. Dutton Green had a party
at the Queen Adelaide Club, when Miss Marie Torrance’s
recitations were the star attraction. This revel could
not well be postponed, because the reciting lady was due
back in Melbourne at the end of the week, having tarried
on these shores as long as the most exacting city-for-cul-
ture had anv right to expect. The reception-room had
the frilliest’chrysanthemums in its hair, and roses of a
superlative kind nodded familiarly at the gilded bunlets
on the tea-table. The hostess is a handsome matron,
and she has several beauteous daughters, who are also
intellectual and charming. Two of them helped her roll
the ball of conversation. Mrs. Dutton Green wore some-
graceful black chiffons and plumed millinery ; her
daughter Olive was a picture-girl in a cream frock, tvon-
drously embroidered ; Miss Torrance recited in a Mel-
bourne creation of copper-colored velvet, strewn with
golden passementerie and tassels. It was a very nice
party. . , . ,
The Frank Fishers gave a gay dance in their house in
Buxton-street, North Adelaide, the other Friday, whereat
numerous dbbutantes burst into bloom and beauty. They
included the vounger damsel of the house, a Hawker
maiden, a Milne daughter, a Burden girl and several
more. The vice-regal daughters, one in black and gold,
the other in white lace, w'ere among a crowd of merely
local beauty-girls.
Someone is going to build us a beautiful set of residen-
tial flats in Adelaide. We want, them badly enough.
There is scarcely a flat to be had in the city, except the
purely human variety.
Having duly set the Poetry Recital Society in, motion,
the Symon dame has run over to Melbourne to hunt up a
well-earned rest. The family, which has the loveliest
mountain home in S. Aus., has moved to town for what
was to have been the season. Other folk chasing the
same elusive period are the W. Reynells, who are flatting
it in town this winter, and two of the Hawker families,
who have deserted the hills for Walkerville.
The net result of the f6te at St. Peter’s College is going
to be something over £5OO, for a single afternoon and
evening. Canon Hornabrook’s poor boys will be
the richer.
Muriel Matters, the Adelaide girl who dropped reel K
to clutch the cause of the suffragettes in Fogcow >
back in VVestralia, where she dwelt for awhile. .
a prospect that she may come a-leeturing on
methods of maltreating: policemen and politicia ,
something: thrilling-like that.
The Herbert Rymills have sold their house on Sstran -
ways Terrace, North Adelaide, and Dr. H. S. .«
has signed a cheque in the same connection. The Kj
have gone to the Grange for a year, probably to he
their little pet Seaton and its golf.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

Mr. J. Fielding,
Sydney’s Leading Card-board Box Manufacturer,
Cures the Colds of His Family and Self with
CHAMBERLAIN’S
COUGH REMEDY
When a leading manufacturer with the business reputation of Mr. J. Fielding gives his
endorsement to a medicine it should convince the most sceptical that it is all the makers claim
for it. After reading his letter, we know that his many friends and acquaintances who wish to
guard against demon cough and cold will do as he does and keep a bottle of Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy in the house.
Dear Sirs, —Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy has been in my house for a very
long time, and both myself and family find it a valuable and
reliable remedy when i{ ‘ demon cough and cold” appears. It has
proved a safe-guard against the approach of the more serious
chest complaints, and regularly taken, according to instructions, it
has always succeeded in getting rid of the trouble, and I now see
“there’s always a bottle on hand.”
J. FIELDING,
k
IT ALWAYS CURES.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
When the Sydney Metropolitan Cricket First-
Grade Premiership match was interfered with by the
untimely passing of Edward VII., Central Cumberland
had scored 135 for the first innings, and University had
lost seven wickets for 73 runs. Things blue, and
the tint deepened when the last man went in with 26
still to make. Great fear fell upon them, and they
played over-cautiously, with the result. that more
than once they escaped with the skin of their
teeth. But thev got the necessary 26 and seven
over, and University won the premiership by
that margin on the first innings. The result gives Uni.
first place with 17 competition points, Central Cumber-
land second with 15, and Burwood third with 13. Glebe
oould climb only to fourth place with 10, and after that
Petersham headed the long tail of single figures and
double figures below zero. It is significant that the
Gordon Club, hailing from the district that is represented
in the State Assembly by the Leg-iron Pretnier, ends the
season 13 behind nothing. Ominous!
* * * *
In the Rugby Union competition three lions
roar along the front rank, Glebe, Newtown and Eastern
Suburbs, each holding six competition points. The
second line is made up of Western Suburbs, Manly, South
Sydney and University with four each ; and Sydney has
two. Balmain, North Sydney and St. George have so far
been the chopping blocks on which the others have
hacked out their fame and glory, and all three fly the
sign of the waterfowl. Union plaj r on Saturday was
strenuous, as indeed it was in all branches and divisions
of the game. Glebe fell on Sydney at University Oval; and,
although at the first Sydney put up a stern resistance, it
petered out and Glebe proceeded to do the dog-walloping
act. The figures were 28 to five, which is an awful score
in Union Rugby. Eastern Suburbs, known to be formid-
able, was expected to simply rage through North Sydney,
and sweep over it like fire over autumn grass. But North
Sydney, is slowly learning its lesson, and put on some
combination ; yet it is learning.So slowly that the end of
the season will arrive before it can turn the lesson to
muoh use. Eastern Suburbs eventually won by 14
points to eight. The most amazing spectacle of
the day, however, was that of Manly rubbing Bal-
main’s nose in the gutter. As remarked last season,
the Village team is an improving one, and its
goal-kicker is a ’bailer on whom there are no flies; so
Manly has a future before it. The scores were 19 to 10.
University’s win by 10 to 5 over Western Suburbs was the
success of a crowd of bullockers over men more skilful but
short of meat. South Sydney downed St. George by six
to nil; but the Saints were not in any way disgraced.
What that team wants is a good instructor who will take
the fine raw material in hand and turn it into a first-class
back machine. No team has more promising men for a
first-class machine. If this is done right away, St.
George will not be far off the top by the end of the season.
The Rugby League clubs served up some
sparkling football, and throughout there was not one
dull match. Some of them, particularly the South
Sydney-Glebe clash, were a trifle too strenuous; but the
parties were equallv willing. Glebe had what looked like
hard luck, but wak in reality more skilful opponents.
Concerted attacks were excellently carried out to a cer-
tain point, and then came to naught just at the critical
moment; and every repulse was followed up with a savage
persistency that made the game end 10 to three in favor of
South Sydney. It was inability to pass quickly and well
that brought about the defeat of North Sydney at the
feet of Eastern Suburbs. Furthermore, the Northmen
were up against Messenger, who is, as everybody admits,
a team in himself. He played a bewildering game, and
his club bathed in the reflected glory. Annandale, the
baby club, went under to Balmain by eight points to
two; but, all the same, the beaten team played a very
pretty game.
* * - * *
So far, in the League competition, no club has
established any supremacy, and Newcastle, South Sydney
and Eastern Suburbs are in the front rank with four each.
North Sydney and Balmain are together in the second
line with two each ; and Glebe, Annandale and Western
Suburbs have not yet broken their shells.
* * * *
The features of the Soccer Division were the
smashing of Glebe by Rozelle by two goals to nil, and
the close will of Granville over Ultimo by three to two.
At the start Rozelle had all the combination and scored
the two goals in consequence. In the second half Glebe
pulled itself together a lot. and showed fine dash.
But the change came too late, and although Rozelle
was hard pressed at the finish, it managed to
win through. Granville was the attacking force all the
time ; Ultimo paid the penalty of all defensive games,
and close upon time Granville was leading by three to
nil. Then Ultimo did some attacking, and scored a
couple of goals in short order, but night and the whistle
cut the effort short and left Granville master of the
field.
* * * *
The Australian game is running strong, and
umpire Petrie is going the right way to keep it so by re-
porting a couple of players—one for rough play and the
other for slanguage. If the League supports him it will
be to the benefit of the game.
* * * *
Sydney put up a cricket score on Redfern,
notching 104 points to 25 ; while Y.M.C.A. beat Padding-
ton by 95 points to 35. But the game of the.day was
East Sydney v. premiers of yesteryear, North Sydney ;
the latter were defeated by 57 points to 30. Newtown
got all over the students of, the Training College—7o
to 38.

The Maoriland Rugby Union football team, for
N.S.W. next month, has a big splash of new blood. It
comprises 20 players (11 forwards and nine backs), and
only seven of the band have previously represented
Maoriland in Australia. F. Roberts (who has “ retired ”
so often that he is the Clem Hill of Australasian football),
O’Leary (of Ponsonby fame, and possibly the finest kick
ever sent out of M.L.), Francis and Mitchinson are well
known in Australia. The new men have shown good form
in M.L., and many of them have camped long and
patiently for the old hands to retire. But they didn’t all
retire ; a new selection committee filled in the new blood,
and M.L. will gain thereby.
* * * *
The Northern Union Rugby team about to
burst on Australia includes 18 internationals, and the
other eight are all among the first-flighters. Of the
crowd there is only one over 6ft., while there are nine of
sft. Bin. and under. Five kick the beam at 14st., and all
the rest are a thick-set crowd, which will take some hard
bumping to shift. + * *
The Yankee football team, which arrives here
in June, is said to be stuffed with fast runners—real high-
flyers of the purest ray serene, or something like that.
And the football matches will be interlarded with run-
ning competitions between the off-men and some of the
local ’Varsity cracks. In a mild way there is quite a
boom round Sydney'in running; and the Harrier clubs
were never more full of enthusiasts. Even the trainway
men are going to run off a championship, and it is
said that the event will bring to light some very fast
dark horses. Riding a tram doesn’t strike one as a busi-
ness likely to foster running; but writer can vouch for
the fact that there are some good sprinters among the
conductors. He has seen some of them put up some
mighty sprints for the last tram home, after walking a
mile or two from the depot to which they were attached.
That is an occasion when the conductor shows what he
really can do. Altogether, the opening season promises
to be about the busiest the A. A. A. has had.
The English Cup (Soccer football), decided last
week, may fairly be called the most sporting competition
in the world. If the Cup of Melbourne can be imagined
as run on the same lines it would mean every township
in the Commonwealth entering a horse on the off chance
of gaining glory ; no handicapping; the competition
lasting over four'months, with the competitors meeting
in pairs, and the winner in each case going' into the hat
for a fresh pairing ; finally, the meeting in Melbourne of
the last unbeaten two. But there would always be the
chance of nerves or excitement knocking out what might
be the best horses in an early round. So it happens that
Newcastle, this .vear’s winner, was recently' only third in the
League; while Barnsley, a little Yorkshire town which got
into the final unbeaten, was half-way down the second divi-
sion of the League (that is, it was not among the best 30
clubs in the country). These two played a drawn game
(one goal each) at the usual final ground, the Crystal
Palace, London. Gate, 70,000. The re-play last Thurs-
day, to save both teams travelling so far south, was at
Liverpool, and Newcastle won by two to nothing. Gate,
60,000.

Maoriland Rugby Union is a ponderous financial
concern which, at the end of its monetary year, had
£11,368 of accumulated funds. Of this, £7620 is out on
loan to the seven provincial unions. It is finding the
competition of the League serious, and proposes to spend
a large swag of its cash in combating the effect of the
visit of the Northern Union team.
Ideal football weather, and the prospect of a
strenuous encounter brought fully 25,000 spectators to
the Vic. League’s chief match on Saturday-—South v.
’Wood. The extra week’s rest seemed to have done both
teams good, and the play was fast, open and skilful, the
high-marking being especially gorgeous, though both
teams need practice in systematic passing. Skinner’s
hirelings went off with a slight lead, but presently lost it,
and at half-time were eight points to the bad. Resuming,
both sides bogged in, and at lemon-time the premiers
were but three points in the rear. Then the Magpies
showed a glimpse of their old methodical game, repeatedly
passed the ball from man to man, and in 10 minutes had
piled up six more goals. A cool captain, handling level-
headed men, might even then have rescued the game for
his club; but the Red-and-Whites went baresark, and
resorted to charging, slinging and stoush. One or two
Magpies retaliated, but the rest attended strictly to
business with such success that in the last term they
added 47 points to South’s 9—totals, ’Wood 87, South 46.
At East Melbourne, ’Varsity collided with
Essendon, and threatened at first to make a good fight,
but speedily discovered that brilliant individual effort is
of little avail against concerted play, and wound up with
58 points to the “Same Old’s” 107. Fitzroy' fell on St.
Kilda with a score of 99 to 36 ; while Richmond, being
drawn against the partially-disrupted Melbourne team,
graciously permitted it to score 37 points while notching
114 itself. There is nothing mean about Richmond ; it likes
to pass a “ dirty doing” to an old opponent, but it also likes
that opponent to make some sort of a show'. At Geelong
the locals gave the Carlton 18 the shook of their lives by
plunging round so energetically’ that at half-time the
board showed Geelong 30 points, Carlton 8; but after
that the unspeakable horror that threatened them drove
the “ Old Blues ” into something resembling their proper
form, arid before the bell rang they had steadily worked
up a tally that wasn’t altogether disgraceful—7s to
Geelong’s 45.
Of the Ass. games that between Brunswick and
F’ran promised most joy ; but the Brickies had apparently
got stringhalt or something, for they could only score
half as fast as P’ran, and finished with 34 points to 68.
The reorganised North Melbourne team, w'ith five League
top-notchers, a man from Boulder City, another from
Horsham and the rest from all over the shop, promised
itself a spell of light recreation in dealing with Footscray,
but was surprised to find that ’Scray took a different
view. Certainly, North ultimately won by 7 59 points
to 42; but had ’Scray’’s kicking been as straight-
forward as its intentions, the result had been different.
The collision between Port and Essendon, which usually
means battle, murder and sudden death, passed off in a
W.C.T.U. manner, victory remaining with the former by
63 points to 55. .Brighton, whose extra allowance for
sea-baths or something has attracted stars from distant
clubs, impressed its superiority on Northcote by 92t044 ;
and Williamstow’n casually’totted up 122 points to Pres-
ton’s seven. Preston’s feat appears to need explanation.
* * * *
The Vic. Football League has complied with
the Association’s request to appoint a joint committee
to discuss the game generally' and to bog into the question
of professionalism particularly. As the Ass. seems to
spend most of its spare time in enticing League stars to
its clubs, its acquiescence shows a nice spirit and a con-
sideration for the purity' of the game that is only equalled
by the ingenuousness of the Ass. in making the request.
Now, if this committee will but tackle its job in an
earnest and conscientious spirit, and will tell the public
exactly what induced four Carlton men to go to North,
and five League ’bailers to join Brighton, and sundry
others various other clubs, the said public will be vastly
interested even if it isn’t as appreciative as it might be.

The international Soccer match between Eng-
lend and Scotland was a joy’ous circumstance last month.
It was played in Glasgow, to a gate of 100,000 people and
£4417 in cash. Scotland won by two goals to none. Four of
the Scotch 11—a smaller proportion than usual—belong
to English clubs, and were brought back for the occasion.
For some years Caledonia did the stern-and-wild act, and
refused to let these emigrants share in test-match honors ;
but without them she got beaten steadily, and as their
numbers kept on increasing she had to draw on them
again. • Every' English club with more money than skill
goes up north and buys a clever Scotchman or two when
it g£ts low down on the scoring lists.

This year the Davis Cup, the visible sign of
tennis supremacy, is to be fought for at Wellington
(M.L.) about Christmas time. When it was asked why
the ball-smiting wasn’t to be at Christchurch (Wilding’s
town and birthplace), as was suggested last year in Syd-
ney, it was explained in an indefinite sort of way that
some mysterious potentate, referred to as “The Gate,”
had dragged the matches to Wellington. Until the cat
rushed forth from the bag in this indecent manner,
everyone had fondly imagined that over the tennis Cup
disturbance no such bogey as “ The Gate” would dare
to raise his head. But there are exes., it is said —un-
avoidable exes.—so “ Gate ” is dragging the lily-white
affair to a place where it is more certain those exes, will
be met.

The real interest in the Parramatta Hundred
final on Saturday' was as to how Arnst would show up.
The crowd didn’t care a hang who won ; the question
was —Can Dick catch his men ? F. Matterson was on
65sec., George Matterson on 46sec., and Theo Towns on
60sec. These were appalling figures ; when Arnst broke
loose F. Matterson was already 300yds. on his 2J miles
journey. With the tide running: the way the scullers were
pulling, all Matterson had to do was to keep up the
pace; the resistance of an incoming: tide, which
would have given Arnst the benefit of his tremendous
strength, was absent. So the result was that, in spite of
as fine an attempt as is possible to imagine, Richard was
able to come in only fourth, the first place being filled
by P. Matterson, with brother George second and Theo
Towns third. Matterson wallowed through in 16min.
17sec., and Arnst did the distance in 15min. 12sec. How
well Richard pulled is evidenced by the fact that, although
'in the matter of time Matterson won by just his handi-
cap, the champion had reduced the 300yds. lead to about
25yds.

“Old Inhabitant” (No. 101): Saw the final of
the Parramatta Hundred on Saturday. Also big Bill
Beach, hugging his opera glasses with one hand and the
flagpole of the judge’s boat with the other. Then I saw
George Matterson and his young brother win the race
between them with a real good showing on a favorable
tide. And, later again, I noticed the Searle memorial at
“ The Brothers.” Hadn't been up the Parramatta for
many years, but it took my mind back to the time when
Matterson was a name to conjure with in the rowing
world. Neil of that ilk brought Harry Searle down from
the Clarence. Neil and his dad had a wine and whisky shop
in George-street, near Market-street, in those days, and
young Searle was the most unsophisticated young 'un I
ever saw in a bar when he first came to town. He
blushed when he was asked to have a drink in those days,
but lost the habit when he had won championship honors
and some dollars. Last time I saw Neil Matterson he
was doing well in the transport service during the
S’Afrioan war. He had a jolly comfortable home close
to the Green Point. Camp at Capetown, and a dinner I
had with him there in the family circle led to many
reminiscences and a not-to-be-forgotten reunion. Don’t
know where he is now ; but he might be a viewer when
Dick Arnst gets to the Zambesi.
* * * *
London Spoktsman, in begging for the neces-
sary funds to send Barry to Africa to have a go at Arnst,
blew off th us wise:—“An appeal to sportsmen to enable
the nation to have one more shot for the world’s
championship. It is 35 years since we held the title, and
14 years since an Englishman competed for it and failed.”
The London press made the appeal for the boodle a
national affair ; and now, after the money has been raked
in, the squabbling over who is going to run the “show”
would shame an up-country Salvation Army band.

:One R. D. Miller, formerly of the Woollon-
gabba team, Brisbane, recently received his trophy for
the best bowling average at Longreach (Q.). He secured
77 wickets at a cost of under three runs per wicket.
Go west, young man—for bowling averages.

The sport of kings is conducted on some novel
racecourses in Maoriland, and the bun-stealer in this
direction hails from Otaki district, already notorious for
its weird Maori gatherings. There the native judge
will sometimes order another round if the leading horse
does not happen to carry his gold dust, and a score of
natives will shout “plotest.” A farmer from England in
that locality also indulges in some private races on Sun-
days to entertain his friends, the steeplechase course
being twice round the farm, then out on the road by way
of a straight, and finish at the church. The local clergy-
man objected to such Sunday desecration, and informed
the farmer that his conduct interfered with the services.
The latter promptly replied, “ Well, my dear chap, they
all use your beastly church as a wool-store during week
days, so I don’t see why I shouldn’t use it as a winning-
post on Sundays.”
A nag named Oilstone, which won the Trial
Handicap at Brisbane Tattersall’s Club races at Eagle
Farm the other day, paid a dividend on the 10s. totalisa-
tor of £B9 11s.. which is at the rate of 178 to 1, But for
the practice of paying a dividend on the second horse in
races where seven or more horses start, the dividend
would have been one-third greater. This is Brisbane’s
best dividend for many years. But in 1892 a horse named
Orator won the Toombul Plate, and paid £159 ss. on the
10s. tote. Patrick Moses laid only 25 to 1 against Oil-
stone, which is a pretty good argument, if one were
needed, in favor of the abolition of, Pat.

“ 0.K.” : Stewards of the turf in Australia are
advised to chew the cud of reflection re an incident in
the career of gee-gee Jenkinson, winner of the last Liver-
pool Grand National Steeplechase. Two years ago, when
the horse was in other hands, he ran unsatisfactorily at
Wolverhampton. The stewards called on the trainer for
an explanation, and the trainer stated that he had merely
wished to give the horse “a schooling gallop” over the
sticks. A higher turf tribunal exonerated the trainer
from any-suspicion of fraudulent intention ; but, after a
further interval, the National Hunt Committee pub-
lished a notice in the Calendar that “schooling gal-
lops” in public would not be sanctioned—public races
would riot be recognised as training exercises for “ un-
ripe ” competitors. Now,in Australia, the“ schoolinggal-
lop ” is accepted as a pardonable fraud on innocent punters.
The horse-reporters of the solemn dailies and weeklies
speak openly, with affected artlessness, of “ pipe-
openers” and of nags that are “out for an airing.’
Flat-racers are “run into form” at race meetings.
Stewards and reporters alike wink at the dishonesty of
the system. One reads that “ Cowcatcher has been
much benefited by his recent gallops in public, and pro-
mises to be thoroughly wound up at the end of next
month.” Also, it is commonly alleged that one good
gallop with the colors up is worth t hree working gallops
on the track, as though horseflesh were less susceptible
than manflesh to the effects of private training. A
pedestrian is admittedly a “cronk” performer if he
races merelv for “ pipe-opening” purposes ; but a horse
that is sent out, unbacked, to be “ sharpened up ” is not
a “cronk” performer—in Australia. The stewards and
the “books” know that he isn’t sufficiently fit to be a
“ trier,” and the ignorance of the public doesn’t matter.

Last week there were two deaths at boxing
matches on opposite sides of the earth. One of them
happened in Sydney, when young Cleborne, well and
popularly known as a swimmer, received fatal injuries
during the amateur championships at Sydney Gaiety.
Result is a threatened agitation for the abolition of the
game, and the overseas tragedy is to be lugged in to
back up the local disaster in rousing horror. We never
get cables when a jockey—unless it is a jockey of pre-
eminence—gets killed in England, and we don’t hear of
it when a footballer is smashed to bits in the U.S.A. It
happens so often that nobody thinks much about it; and
no one dreams of advocating the suppression of horse-
racing, in which hundreds of boys risk their lives weekly
to make an exciting gamble for the fatuous punters.
What is required is not the abolition of boxing, but a
more rigid inspection by medical men of those who enter
the ring. Especially in thecase of amateurs. Only one ama-
teur in a dozen is properly fit ; scores of them rely upon
the condition acquired by football, swimming, and other
re"ular outdoor sports to fit them for a contest in the
ring. Also, it should be seen to that the floors whereon
amateurs meet are properly padded. This is not so neces-
sary in the case of professional scraps—the professional
bruiser is a past-master in the art of avoiding damage to
his precious bacon. Writer, as a matter of business,
has been attending professional scraps in Sydney for
about 10 years now, and, barring the smashing of McColl
by Tim Murphy at the Gaiety, never yet saw the wallop-
ing he would not cheerfully have taken for half the
money—not even excepting the walloping handed out to
Noah Brusso by one named Johnson. That boxing
should be taught in every public school is a question for
national consideration. Nothing makes for stamina like it;
and football, cricket and hockey are not in the same street
as a maker of self-reliant, hardy men. Your boxer when in
condition has every vital part protected by a thick shield
of toughened muscle that makes it impossible to kill him
with anything but an axe or firearms. In fact, writer
goes further, and would allow no man to marry who had
not passed through a course of training to fit him for
pugilistic honors. What is wanted is physical culture
and development, combined with cultivation of the
mental qualities, that enable a man to take punishment,
keep cool while being knocked to splinters, and fight on
in the face of imminent disaster. And if there is anything
better for this than boxing exercise, writer urgently
requests anybody having- the missing thing’s address to
communicate with this office immediately.
The awful truth has escaped from the big bag
and is blinking its eyes in the light of day—a nigger is
helping to get Jeffries into trim to bash the other coon.
The black assistant is a pug of great size, known as Arm-
strong, and Jeff is plugging him daily in an attempt to
discover the main weaknesses of the black man. Until re-
cently Armstrong was with Massa Johnsing, so besides
learning something about nigs in general, Jeff probably
hopes to learn something about Johnsing in particular.
Frank Thorn, dissatisfied with the Sydney de-
cision against him, met Arthur Douglas, the S’African
“feather,” who has the reach of an ourang, the consti-
tution of a postal pillar, and a countenance of approved
cement, at Melbourne Indoor Sports Club’s Emporium
the other Monday. The boys pelted each other with
excess of vigor in round I, but Douglas’s pelting was the
harder. So was his pelt; and it looked, therefore, as if
he were going through the Australian like a terrier
through a barrel of rats. Thorn was down after two
minutes’ milling, and indulged himself in eight thought -
ful seconds on the linoleum, after which he resumed
operations with no abatement of his former enthusiasm,
and, to the surprise of a crowd that had seen Frank’s
finish in thatfirst burst, thebattle went a full 20. Thorn is
easily the cleverer of the two boys : he can land his blows
more cleanly and more frequently than Douglas, and
could dance out of the way of six out of 10 of the
African’s punches. But he was fighting a gum stump,
and the more he thumped it the less it mattered. More-
over, one punch of Douglas’s is worth about 14 5-7 of
Thorn’s. The referee evidently took this into account,
and Douglas was declared winner. He had certainly done
the most damage.
The Mclnstoush will close the Stadium for the
winter—as a fighting resort, anyhow. He does not con-
sider bruising a winter pastime. Neither does the public,
as the Unholz-Cullen scrap proved. This scrap was a fine
sample of a strenuous and charming go. Unholz went
baresark, frantic and the rest of it in splendid style ; and
although he was hanged, punched and slaughtered over
and over again, he kept on coming with a fine resolution,
which dazzled the referee and drove him to make a
draw of a fight in which Unholz, in spite of showing
splendid courage, grit and determination, really got the
worst of it. It was probably the worst battering Rudie
has ever received, and, sad to say, he got for it about the
smallest cheque he has ever received. The fighters’
share of the small, chilly house was only,£2o each.' Still,
that was better than a poke in theeye with stick.
“Tahmmy” Burns will been a mighty good
wicket during his coming visit to America. In the
arranged Langford-Burns match, the winner is to get
£4OOO, and £2OOO goes to the less , fortunate. Also
“Tahmmy” gets a £lOOO bonus, irrespective of the
result. It pays a great deal better to be a champion
prizefighter than almost anything else on this planet—at
least, so far as gathering wealth easily is concerned.
* * ’* *
The Marama, leaving Sydney on June 6 for
Yankeeland. will carry many Australians who are rushing
to get a glimpse of the Jeffries-Johnson scramble. M‘ln-
stoush, “Tahmmy” Burns, Bob Fitzsimmons, Bill Lang,
and trainer Nathan will be in the party ; and, after the
trouble between the two J’s is over, Bill Lang will make
an effort to warm himself on the nasal organ of whatever
happens in the way. _ <■

Rickard, one of the alleged promoters of the
Jeffries-Johnson mill, has announced that there will he
seated in the front row a relieving referee to take on the
job should the man originally chosen be accidentally
laid out by one or both of the contestants. So far, no
referee, even in Amurka, the land of wonders, has ever
been knocked out accidentally during a scrap; but
Rickard is taking no chances.
* * * *
Seems that there was some grit about
the Yankee Judge who refused to discharge
Johnson when the prosecutor and his principal
witnesses failed to appear. The Judge suspected
they had been nobbled by Johnson, and said
so. They were State witnesses, and as he considered the
Court had been trifled with, he called on Johnson to
prove that he had not squared the classically named
Norman Pindar. In the meanwhile, be sent the
papers on to the Grand Jury, and raised Johnson’s bail till
that body bad dealt with the charge. As Pindar-was, at
latest advices, still missing, Johnson’s bail has been ex-
tended and reduced, as he has proved to satisfaction that
he was present at considerable trouble and expense. In
fact, it is said that to get to court in time he had to
smash up the speed regulations, and was fined for his
haste.

John Wren continues to lick up the racecourses
which happen in his way in Queensland. The purchases
thus far are—Albion Park, Deagon (Sandgate) and Bun-
damba; and as the Wren “ Two Thousand ’—in-
augurated to boom the concern—attracted 74 entries,
Jack Dicky Bird has made a big start.
The proposal of the Maoriland League of
Wheelmen to raise the prize for the Timaru-Christchurcb
road race to £lOO is causing much comment in Australia.
The Dunlop Co., which has spent thousands on fostering
road racing, is totally opposed to big prizes, on the
ground that they make for demoralisation, and points
out that it was big cash prizes that killed the game in
Australia. Seems to be a lot of horse-sense about the
argument too ; and the examples quoted are unanswer-
able. Wherever the money is there the boodlers are
gathered together ; and while affairs like the Warrnam-
bool can be brought off for a gold medal and £2O, it does
seem unnecessary to flash £lOO prizes about. A case of
“Better Not.” ■
From a man at Longreach, in Western Queens-
land (30/4/'10): While I was absorbing Nature on the
banks of the Thompson last Sunday, a casual sort of
person rode up and asked where he might pitch camp.
Turning, I saw a much travel-stained cyclist, whose
machine bore a weird assortment of goods—amongst
other things a gun, photograpnic outfit, cooking utensils,
and a kangaroo’s tail. Taking a fishing line he baited it,
and left that to start a cooking fire. This done, he com-
menced to develop some pictures. Just at that stage I
struck the name on his satchel —“F. Birtles.” He s a
true son of Australia, all right.

The Reason Why
The Palmer Cord Tyres
take precedence with

Absence of internal friction makes them the

They increase the speed at a lower con-
I sumption, of petrol.
Tjiey raise less dust—have greater wearing

Their immunity from side slip make them a

‘Kodak” Photography means Photography
with all the bother left out!
Don’t go groping in the
dark —invest in a Kodak
Daylight Developing Tank.
The Kodak Daylight Developing Tank is made in two styles, one lot use with toll Him,
the other for plates.
With that for films, absolutely no recourse need be made to a dark room; every mg
carried out in daylight with a certainty and ease that is astonishing.
With the Tank for plates it is necessary to load it in the dark; but, nevertheless, there is nothing
like the discomfort, the uncertainty and unhealthiness usually associated with dark room develop
This new method of developing marks the introduction of a great advance in photographic
manipulation. It stands for certainty as against uncertainty; science versus guesswork.
The prices of the Kodak Tanks for films are:
Brownie Tank Developer, 14s. 6d.; 3iin. Kodak Tank Developer, il 7s. 6d.
Sin. Kodak Developer, £110s.; 7in. Kodak Tank Developer, £2 7s. 6d.
The prices of the Kodak Tanks for plates are
sin. x 4in. Eastman Plate Tank, 15s. ; sin. x 7in. Eastman Plate Tank, £1 2s. 6d.
(Takes also 3iln. x 4iln. size.) (Takes also 6*in. x 4|ln. size.)
We have published a booklet dealing with Tank Development, and this we will be pleased
to forward free on receipt of your request. Write for a copy to-day.
The No. 3 Folding Pocket Kodak
takes splendid pictures, measuring 3£in. x 4jin.—the
popular quarter-plate size—and has a capacity of 12
exposures without reloading. It is fitted with a Rapid

TWO VERY POPULAR KODAKS

Builds Up
Delicate Children
Dear Sirs, —My little boy lias been a constant worry to us through loss
of appetite. We could not get him to eat any kind of food, and he
became as thin as a rail. We tried many different remedies without benefit,
and began to fear he would develop consumption. A iriend advised
Angler’s Emulsion, and it has had a marvellous effect upon my little boy’s
health. To-day he can eat like a farmer, and is.well and strong and in
perfect health. I have no hesitation in saying that Angier’s Emulsion is
a splendid remedy for delicate children. (Name and address privately.)
The soothing and strengthening properties of Angier’s Emulsion and its
agreeable, cream-like taste make it the ideal remedy for delicate children.
It makes the little ones eat better, digest better, sleep better, and rapidly
gain in weight, strength and colour. Doctors prescribe it for coughs and
all lung weakness, scrofula, rickets, malnutrition and all wasting and
bowel disorders. Of Chemists, 1/3, 2/9 and 4/6.

IN
BANANA LAND
A. R. MacDonald, Bananaland’s Under-
secretary for Mines, who has reached the point
in his innings at which the Public Service Acts
'usually declare the player “out,” has been asked
to keep a hold on his office bat till further notice.
The Under-Sec., who was 65 last March, has been
in his present situation for just on 10 years ; and
the Government, in asking him to stay on, took
the opportunity to pay a compliment "to a good
servant.
Queensland railways still provide acrustfor
G. G. Ferguson, the engineer who drove the first
passenger train on the Brisbane-Ipswieh line. The
old foot-plater, who has been in the service 43
years, has just been given a chance to get away
for a hurried trip to Britain and America.
Sosh isn’t always in the shape of a tiger.
Up at Longreach it is inside a bull’s hide ; in fact,
three bulls’ hides. The local shire council bought
the bulls for the benefit of local (mostly' anti-Sosh)
milk-growers ; and there is money in the dreadful
experiment for both stockowners and shire.
And. up to now, it hasn’t shattered any happy
homes or done the other frightful things "that the
maniacs prophesied it was bound to do.
“ XXX ” : A Brisbane daily has lately
been booming the aboriginal and half-caste girls
in the various Queensland Government Homes as
domestic servants. It is perfectly true these girls
do make very efficient domestic helps, but the
painful fact that two-thirds become unmarried
mothers after a year or two in service militates
very much against them. The Queensland Home
Department could supply' some very striking
figures on this subject.
They don’t go much on the sectarian
racket up north. At Rockhampton the other
day the Scotch byterian parson mentioned that,
when his little lot started saving souls there-
abouts, the Primitive Methodists lent their
tabernacle; the Church of England schoolroom
was used for the ordination of the first elders ;
and the “ Romans ’’ an ted-up a good part of the
money with which the kirk was finally built. It
may be that the Devil is a brisk citizen up north,
and the tabernacles are too busy fighting him to
have time for fighting one another ; and in that
case it might not be a bad plan to give the
northern devil a trip south for the next few
months.
“Via”: At time of writing, Brisbane is
supporting two theatres and five picture shows;
and the ghost walks to regular music. Two new
theatres are in the air—both to be on city' blocks.
Yet the population of Brisbane and suburbs is
only about 130,000. Buskin and Co. are evidently
grabbing the skirts of capital as it flees from a
country cursed with a Labor party.
Mount Morgan hospital has a cheque for
£lOOO in its pocket, the gift of Mrs. T. S. Morgan-
aire Hall, who wants it to go towards providing a
sanatorium for consumptives in Central Banana-
land. Very sensibly Mount Morgan asks all the
central-western hospitals and towns to come into
the scheme ; and they are thinking over it. Up
till now, central and northern Bananaland con-
sumptives have had to journey to Dalby, away
in the south ; but the £lOOO foundation, and the
almost certain support of the western towns,
make it look as if they will soon be able to get
treatment much nearer home.
HE KNEW.
SISTER (knitting): “ Oh. Tommy , you're a darling , dvcky little”
TOMMY: “ Not if it's upstairs, Sis.”
John George, a teacher at Indoorobpilly,
Brisbane, is the first Queensland-trained teacher,
it is said, to get his M.A. degree at Sydney Uni-
versity. He has fought his way from a pupil-
teachership, battling along since 1884.
The Commonwealth collects £25 each from
Kellett and Ransomey the two quaint gentlemen
who offered their invaluable services as senators
on the Independent ticket.
A sitting of the Queensland. Presbyterian
General Assembly in Brisbane was enlivened by
a vehement effort towards Reform. One-of the
“meenisters” wanted to know what claim Dr.
Hay, of Rockhampton, had to the title of “Right
Reverend ” when all his brethren present were
styled “Reverend” only. A Scotch parsonical
humorist suggested “Rather Reverend” as • a
modification of the ministerial handle, while
another divine hit the nail on the head by re-
marking that “ Reverend ” was just as objection-
able, as undemocratic, and as un-Christian as
“ Right Reverend.” Did the Scriptures mention
the Rev. Peter or the Rev. Paul ? The Assembly
abolished Dr. Hay’s double title by a majority of
one vote, but clung lovingly to its own time-
honored tag or label.
The Light o’ Love.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, she was made for a light o’love, with
her silk-white skin and her wand’ring
eye;
Would ye tell a butterfly not to rove, or a
lark to leave the sky ?
Set her to spin—what could she prove,
Fashioned but for a light o’ love?
Rachel filled at the spring her bowl, and Deborah
held her pitcher high,
Dropped the eyelid to save the soul ; the red-
mouthed girl saw the knights ride by.
Clatter of hoofs as the chargers passed, where a
Royal Duke and his henchman move ;
Long was the look he backward cast at the woman
meant for a light o’ love !
The very shape of her called for love, and the very
lips of her drew your own ;
Whistle the wild swan not to rove, and fasten the
door when the steed has flown !
They have puzzled sore for her empty place,
homely maids who demurely move—
Would ye starch a coif for that laughing face, only
meant for a light o’ love?
Dirk came back from the town this noon, full o’
the sights the city knows—
Slim-necked ladies in scarlet shoon, rapiered gal-
lants in silken hose;
And one who sat on the Duke’s right hand, hung
■ with jewels in satin mask—
“ Zum furrin fancy ! ” the gaffers said. I lipped
my tankard ; I did not ask.
Tell a butterfly not to rove, or a steel-winged
| goshawk not to fly ?
She was made for a king’s light love, with her silk-
white skin and her wand’ring eye !
(Mask and jewel—the gauds to prove
She was meant for a light o’ love !)
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORBEST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane. May 14, 1910.
My Dear Tharoomindah, —
There is hardly a building in Brisbane but is
swathed in mourning. Colors have been discarded
by most people, too, and all official engagements
are off. Several of the more important balls are
not to take place at all this season, and the
Macgregor “vision,” who is in deep black, will
therefore miss some fun. She dances, lam told,
like thistledown.
As I write, daughter Celia, of the Chief Justice
Cooper family, is getting aboard the Eastern, en
route to Japan. She travels with the ex-Justice
Chuhbs, who will leave a daughter behind them
—she is to wed there.
The Grey-Knight season ended as it began,
with full houses; and the announcement by
Julius of his-.xleparture to England early next
year did not worry the folk so much as the fact
that the Grey lady' will come back no more.
.Katherine captured Brisbane, so to speak.
The engagement of Mr. A. Jardine, the
widowed brother-in-law of the late Sira Palmer,
and Miss Harding, of Ipswich, no longer attempts
to hide itself. The next thing to be tracked
down is the rumor that a certain sprig of nobility
floating hereabouts, will also presently in vite con-
gratulations upon the capture of a very popular
girleen. But mum’s the word at present.
Grace Palotta and Hugh Ward flitted past us
on Sunday last, bound from Rockhampton to
goodness knows where; and the smiling lady
smiled as sweetly as of yore. What has always
puzzled me is how the graceful Grace contrives to
jescape marriage.
Brisbane is earning an evil reputation owing to
the unclean condition of its footpaths. And,
apparently, all that is required to keep them
decent and wholesome is the removal of a small
piece of red tape. Each evening the principal
wood-blocked roadways are swilled down by the
representatives of the City Council, but it
seems as much as their jobs are worth
to turn the product of Enoggera or Gold
Creek on to the side-walks. The last two mayors
have been so busy pushing into the Town Hall
scrimmage that they have had no time to spare
for details of city cleanliness ; but the present
wearer of the ermine cloak is an ordinary, intelli-
gent man, which induces me to ask him to take a
stroll round Queen, George, Adelaide and Ed-
ward streets any fine morning, and note, both
with eye and nose, the general condition of foot-
way's over which he exercises control. I will go
with him if he likes, and point out where the dust
and dirt of ages have accumulated against the
buildings. I know that the mounds are ages old
because of the fossil marks.
There seems to be a need of gentle and unbiassed
inquiry within the Agricultural Department as
to why each and every one of the imported ex-
perts is making a graceful and unanimous exit.
The first to set the fashion was the valuable and
brainy dairy-authority Thomson. At the time
of his departure a rumor of friction was
hinted at. Then came the retirement of
Benson, the fruit expert, who hastily' grasped
•a billet in the Apple Island. Before he fled he
delivered himself of sundry remarks upon the heat
of the position created by the indoor staff. Next,
the newly-acquired Dodd, whose specialty is
microbes in stock, put on his hat and said “Good
day.” Now it is said that Tryon, the spring-bug
hunter, is anxious to flit to Papua, or almost any-
where else. We haven't even a “chook” expert
left here now.
Another trick of coincidence. Some two years
and a half ago an old and trusted messenger of
the Queensland National Bank discovered a young
fellow on the bank premises, and, in the struggle
that ensued, fatally shot him. After an exhaustive
inquest, the action of the shooter was held to be
justified. On Thursday last, the old man was
discovered dead in almost the same spot where
that shot was fired. Heart failure seems to have
been the trouble this time.
Philip Newbury, who has been here for the
Stahat Mater performance by the Brisbane Musi-
cal Union, delighted Brisbane with his fine voice ;
but he didn’t make friends with the house over a
recall in the second part. The contralto singer
of the evening, Miss Lena Hammond, has greatly
improved since her recent Sydney visit, where
additional polish was placed upon her notes.
The newest story concerning Julius Superbus
comes from W.A. When Marcus was in Perth
he took up the buttermilk craze, which, as every-
one knows, is said to conduce to perpetual
youth. Whether he already began to feel the
prick of infantile joy, or what turned him gener-
ous, doesn’t transpire ; anyhow, he caused to be
sent to a charming member of the company a
portion of the potent liquid. As the charming
member is rather burdened with youth, she
washed in it and found it very good, which the
local water wasn’t. Julius was informed of the
fate of his precious elixir, and cut off the supply
before any more of it could be turned to so base a
use.
Wee Macgregor is an improvement on Queens-
land’s usual uniformed vice-regal lodger, who has
mostly chased off to winter resorts on the first
approach of summer perspiration. Instead, the
Macgregor revels in the Bananaland warmth,
and says in effect: “Hot? You oughter been
where I’ve been.” He told Longreach the other
day it had the finest climate in the world ; and he
seemed to mean it, too.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
Bananaland has missed many a fat cheque
because of its foolish law which prevents men
trapping rabbits for profit. The idea is an old
Tory one—that if the industry were allowed, the
men would encourage the multiplication of bunny.
It is even an offence to sell a rabbit in Queens-
land; yet rabbits from N. S. Wales are occasionally
sold without anybody going to gaol over it. If
some genius were to begin trapping for profit, it
would bring things to a head ; and in these days
of boom prices for furs and skins, the Govern-
ment might even go so far as to hint that, for a
time at least, it would be found to be blind in that
eye.
A North Coast (N.S.W.) farmer, who de-
cided to trek to the Atherton (N.Q. )ratherthanpay
the shipping co. the £3 per head it wanted, is tack-
ling the overlanding of 1000 head. He reckons the
cost will be £1 each, and that the 1500-mile
journey will take 10 months.
“ Annie Baggs, ” Bananaland’s best-known
swaggeress, rolled up her bluey for the last time
at Townsville a week or two back. “Annie’s”
beat was from Townsville to Cairns, with an
occasional stroll as far south as Mackay. “ Seven
years in bags, seven years in rags and seven years
a lady ” was her motto; but she was still in the
rags stage when she died. There was evidently a
man iii the case; wherefore she shunned the sex,
and always carried a loaded “gun ” for use when
she met “the villain.” “Annie” was well edu-
cated, and could still be persuaded to stroke the
piano; but woe to the unfortunate who made any
interruption while the stroking was in progress.
When she gets her harp, the ushers will have to
fly very noiselessly if they don’t want some of the
golden paving-stones thrown at them.

In this life no sight is more common than
that of “Wise men being led by asses.”
This is particularly so amongst fat people.
You grow fat and fatter —you seek advice
and are told “yourcondition is natural,” or
to “ let well enough alone.” You know
better—you know that your condition is not
n itural. nor is it “well enough”; but your
faith, inculcated in childhood, leads you to
follow advice steeped in ignorance.
Revolve the subject in your mind,
and you’ll soon see that the thousands
who have been reduced from intolerable
Obesity to normal weight and proportions
must make a falsifier of your original
adviser. You are following an unin-
tentionally false friend. Stop !

BY HIS EXCEL-
LENCY’S COMMAND,
by Roy Bridges,
Author of “The Barb
of an Arrow.” Illustrated
Paper Cover, 1/- (postage 3d.).
Bushranging in Tasmania a
hundred years ago was an ex-
citing, if not always a profit-
able, occupation. It was sup-
posed to be the prerogative of
the sterner sex, but even in
those days there was unfair, or
should we say “fair,” com-
petition. A special officer is
detailed to hunt her down.
The officer is both young and
susceptible, and although he
succeeds in capturing the
’ranger, she, in turn, takes him |
ten times captive—and—they are both par-
doned. Mr. Lionel Lindsay, who supplies the
illustrations, has never done cleverer work.
NEW EDITION.
WHY DOHERTY DIED ? Humorous Budgeree
Ballads, by TIIOS. E. Spencer, Author of
“How McDougall Topped the Score,” “ The
Spring Cleaning.” With six full-page illus-
trations bv J. F. Scott.
Illustrated Paper Cover, 1/- (post free, 1/4).
The author of “ How McDougall Topped the
Score ” has again vindicated his title to be con-
sidered one of Australia’s best versifiers. The
“ Budgeree Ballads” ripple with closer merri-
ment all the way through. In the new edition
the name of the book has been altered to Why
Doherty Died,” owing to some confusion re-
garding the meaning and scope of the first title.
ÜBIQUE, by Clarence W. Martin, Author of
l< 'Plm I iiof A f T-I of A * *
“The Lust of Hate.'
Illustrated Paper Cover, 1/- (postage 3d.).
The mathematical methods of the “Sherlock
Holmes” detective story have began to pall.
“ Übique ” furnishes the other side of the story,
for here the smart detective is made to look
silly by the side of a criminal whose scientific
superiority never fails. There is infinite variety
in the series, as no two cases are alike. Readers
who enjoy bushranging and detective stories
will welcome “ Übique.”

“Snell”: A counter hand at a Melbourne
hardware establishment told me of a pleasant customer
who had been in during 1 the morning. He wanted to see
razors, and was shown a safety. “ Take it away,” he
said. “It might do for shaving very well; but how’s a
man to cut his throat with a thing like that ? ” “ Great
Scott! ” gasped the shopman, “do you want to cut your
throat?” “ Nothing of the kind,” retorted the customer,
indignantly. “ But I’m a careful man, and I consider
every contingency that may arise.”
* * * *
“ T. 8.” : Talking about elections. When
Meagher contested Rous (N.S.W.) against Coleman (de-
ceased), he found Clunes a red-hot Methodist centre
where sectarianism was rampant; and as it wasn’t
Meagher’s brand, he obtained only two votes out of 100
or so. Next election it was Meagher versus Hindmarsh
(present member). Paddy McSniff offered to bet a pound
that this time Meagher would get more than two votes.
Paddy was taken up several times. It looked like a
“ dead cert,” the vote was so solid. Still, Paddy said he
would chance it. On polling day he drove a couple of
voters over from Lismore, and Meagher got four votes—
the previous two again and McSniff’s two. Then Paddy
drove round and collected a few pounds.
The cow cockvts a mean cuss, and the richer he
is the meaner he seems to be. Murwillumbah, on the
Tweed River (N.S.W.), where the cow-man is probably
wealthier than in any other part of the Commonwealth,
had a hospital Saturday recently. For a week or so
before it happened the local papers told cow-cocky that
hitherto he hadn’t contributed much, if anything, to the
hospital, and asked him not to forget some loose silver
when he came to town on Hospital Saturday. Now, as a
rule, Murwillumbah is full of cocky on Saturday ; yet on
Hospital Saturday he was absent nearly to a man. He
had almost unanimously made his weekly visit to town the
day before.
An Australian piano manufacturer must grow
very old in the business, it seems, before he will be gene-
rally accepted as a product of the Commonwealth. A
humorous illustration of this appeared in a letter written
to Beale, of Sydney, who had been barracking for his friend,
Deakin. An irate Australian wrote to him from up-
country, warning him that Australian workers wanted no
German interference with their political affairs, and
advising him to return to Kaiscrland at once if he didn’t
want to be wiped out. The writer of the lurid epistle
associated Beale with pianos, and, of course, pianos must
be German—they couldn’t possibly be Australian 1

A show happened lately up Nambucca River
(N S.W.) way, and a local farmer—a Mr. W. G. Smart—
sent'along a'collection of vegetables produced on his bit
o’land. Some of the vegetables herewith : Sugar cane,
rye corn, oats, lucerne, hay, barley, flax, bacon, pine-
apples, white maize (two varieties), sheep burnett, canary
grass, millet (four kinds), thousand-headed kale, wheat,
sorghum (2), 19 grasses, potatoes (8), sunflower (2), let-
tuce, endive, mangel wurtzel, peanuts, loofa (raw and
prepared), eggs, salsify or oyster plant, leeks, egg-plant,
beans (15), grammas, chillies (16), cotton, squashes (17),
tomatoes (7), honey (wax and mead), artichokes, pop and
popped corn, cheese, dressed poultry, passion fruit,
lemons, oranges (2), Cape gooseberry, limes, mandarins(2),
chokos, spinach, figs (fresh and bottled), dried figs and
tomatoes, candles, soap, horse-hair brushes, two millet
brooms, cow-peas (two), celery, radishes, Swede turnips,
sugar beet, beetroot, cucumbers, cow horns, feathers,
feather dusters, separator brushes, horse-hair, ointment,
marsh mallow, quill pens, fruit cordial (two), cayenne
pepper arrowroot and potato starch, dried herbs, dried
rennet,’ bottled fruit, lard, soft soap, pickles and pre-
serves, etc. In fact, about the only vegetables this
scandalously-laz.v Australian didn’t produce were aero-
planes and Deform politicians.
Perhaps the boarder begins to see his proper
place in the scheme of things when he reads advts. like
this from the S. M. Herald (19/4/ 10):

“ Ghloe”: The boom in rubber should fix the
attention of the Commonwealth authorities on that
portion of our own territory which is suitable for rubber
cultivation. The plant would find a suitable home on
almost any of the Northern Territory rivers; also in
N.W. Australia. Why not have an experimental area—a
native reserve, and make use of the aboriginal? He is
there a factor to be reckoned with in the development
of the Nor’-West, and it would be no backsliding on the
part of a Labor Government to make an asset of him
instead of a dead-weight. I say he is a factor to be
reckoned with ;he has already been a factor—an im-
portant one—in the settlements from Onslow to Wynd-
ham The squatters of these areas were not capitalists.
They were bullock-drivers, teamsters, telegraph clerks
and'policemen. But they knew the country, and they
knew what could be got out of the blacks by tact, and
to-day they could buy out most of us. It seems like the
straight tip to the Government.

Lung Trouble
can be cured
by SCOTT’S
Emulsion
Lung trouble, acute or
chronic, is cured by taking
Scott’s Emulsion. Scott’s
Emulsion permanently cures
lung trouble. This state-
ment is made because hun-
dreds of people have written
to say they were cured of
lung trouble by Scott’s
Emulsion. For example, Mrs.
A. Peters wrote, 24th July,
1909, from 79, Raglan Street,
Waterloo, Sydney, N.S.W.:
df
“My daughters were always delicate and
subject to lung and chest complaints, so I
decided to give Scot* ': Emulsion. In a
few weeks both ha<* gained
considerably in weight, were
eating heartily and sleeping
well. I had not thought it
possible they could so rapidly
be restored to complete good
health ; they have no sign of
a cold and look bright and
well. This trademark was on
the emulsion I bought. ”
If you wish to get rid of your
lung trouble, and decide to
buy Scott’s Emulsion, decide
also to GET SCOTT’S
EMULSION. You may be
asked to buy another emul-
sion and told it is “just as
good as Scott’s.” Substitute
emulsions can only be sold
on the reputation of Scott’s
Emulsion.
Scott’s Emulsion cures the disease—
no matter the age of the patient—and
will be approved by your Doctor for
Lung Trouble if you ask him.

The Wonderful Thing
about the Edison
Phonograph
as an entertainer is that it gives you
your kind of amusement —your kind
of musie. That is because it gives
any kind.
The Edison Phonograph is the most
versatile instrument extant —it repro-
duces selections from grand opera
perfectly, as well as high-grade concert
music, ballads, dialogues, vaudeville
items and dance music. It is the ideal
entertainer for both old and young.
Go to an Edison store and ask to
hear an Edison Phonograph. Ask
particularly to hear an Amberol
Record —the Record that plays for
four minutes instead of two, and that
gives more people more of the kind of
music they enjoy.
If you do not know the address of
an Edison store in your town, write
direct to us and let us tell you.

“ Wombat” : Recently I paid a visit to the bush hamlet
■where I was born. The only face that hadn’t changed was
that of the Cow—the blank eternal Cow. She was the axis
of that smothered world. One night I attended a concert /
at the Mechanics’ Institute, at which the programme was
as follows: Chorus, “The Dairymaids”; recitation,;
“ The Old Dun (not damn) Cow ”; song, “ The Cows are
in the Corn ” ; child’s recitation, “ Where are you going
to, my pretty maid ? I’m going a milking, sir, she said ” ;
comic song, “The Old Bull and Bush” (if it had been
named “The Old Cow and Calf” it would have gone
better); remarks by the chairman concerning increased
Cow extract in district. About two hours after the con-
cert ended I was awakened by an infuriated man rushing
round the rooms banging at the doors and yelling,
“Ain’t yer goin’ ter get up terday? Ain’t yer had
enough sleep yet ? I’ve had the cows in this haif-hour.”
I pulled the clothes over my head and begged Providence
to blast the cows.
Hugh Buckler, who plays “leading gentleman ” in the
George Willoughby co., was one of the crowd that Beer-
bohm Tree took to Berlin some two or three years ago at
the invitation of Kaiser William. He tells an interesting
story of the ill-feeling with which the visiting Englanders
were received in the German mummer-world, a feeling
intensified by the fact that Kaiser Will, who is not an
enthusiastic theatre-goer as a rule, attended nine of the
10 performances given by' the visitors. What the Ger-
mans objected to, says Buckler, was the suggestion that
Tree and co. had been brought from London to teach
them how Shakspeare should be staged and played. In
their artistic circles it is claimed that the Bard has be-
come a naturalised German subject. They always reckoned
themselves profounder students of Shak. than the English
are, and their art of producing his plays got a gratifying
advt. long ago, when the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen’s-court
company went to London and played “Julius C»sar ” in
a way that made the cockneys sit up. The management
of the crowd in the Antony oration scene was almost as
good as Oscar Asche would have it nowadays. At that
time it was a revelation outside of Germany. Having
established a foreign reputation for their Shakspearian
show’s, the Germans never approved of the efforts of
Irving and his followers in the same direction. Beerbohm
Tree and his crowd were treated as intruders in the
domain of German Art. Even the permanent stage-hands
at the theatre w’here the Englishmen played made them-
selves unpleasant. Members of the co. had narrow
escapes from being injured by heavy things which dropped
accidefitaliy from the flies. One night the Deutscher
assistants went on strike with the hope of “queering”
the shotv, and the men of the company, including Tree,
had to work hard to get things fixed up.
The cranky young Englishman, Lionel Terry, who
shot a Chinaman in Maoriland by way of supporting the
White Australia policy, is said to be just now practising
the Simple Life at a lunatic asylum at Christchurch. He
rejects all animal food, and clothes himself in as much
nakedness as decency permits. Also he lives in the open
air, and has written a poem entitled “ The Prison Cage,”
illustrated with clever drawings, plain and colored, de-
picting the difference between the inter-mural customs
of modern civilisation and the untrammelled Simple Life.
The interesting Terry has seemingly borrowed his fad
from “The Arcadians.” In that inspiring musical
comedy the simple livers subsist on fruits and w'ater, and
listen spellbound to the story of a people who live in
cages of brick and stone and breathe an atmosphere of
smoke mixed with fog. “ They even sleep in their cages,”
says the Arcadian lady who dreamed about them. The
awestruck listeners repeat after her, “Sleep in cages!”
And the audience realises, for a moment, the unnatural
foolishness of existence in a three-storeyed hash-house or
a Queen Anne villa. The artistic crank who shot the
Chinaman must have seen “The Arcadians ” before he
left London, or has been reading about it. He fancies
that he was dipped into the Well of Truth and was re-
christened Simplicitas, What an enviable hallucination 1
“Scrib”: “ 0.K.,” in his par. (B. 21/4/10) referring to
the artists who have migrated from the vaudeville stage
to the theatre and back again, omitted to mention
Ernest Fitts, who, after, singing for some months for
Rickards, left to do Gilbert and Sullivan work for Wil-
liamson. When that engagement terminated, he re-
turned to the Opera House. Fitts is a dentist, but
tooth-drawing was not to his liking, so he threw it away.
Now he has done the same with “Poverty Point,” and
has gone on the land somewhere on the outskirts of Vic-
toria. ‘
“Snell” : Rickards has the limit in one Billy Williams,
known as “The Man in the Velvet Suit.” This Willie
Billiams has a large repertoire of sputters and giggles.
He’comes on giggling, he giggles all the time he is on,
and he goes off giggling. William Bill has several songs to
sing, but he never quite succeeds in singing them, having
to stop every second line, or so to contort himself with
fictitious glee. The only things quite definite about Bill
Willie, apart from his velvet suit and his delirious giggle,
are his innuendoes ; and for fear there should be any popu-
lar ’misunderstanding about them, Billy Will giggles all
over them and all overthe stage. He is the walkingdele-
gate of the Kew contingent of Demented Gigglers. It is
sad for any man to be afflicted like that ; it is a sin to
make a show of it.
Why did Dion Boucicault., the elder, drop the “r”
from his name? In a 60-vear-old book of theatrical
reference the author of “London Assurance,” then a
man of 30 odd, is referred to as Dion Bourcicault, and he
carried the “ r ” with him when he first went to America
in 1853. Returning to Britain two or three years later he
called himself Boucicault, the name his children have
always borne.
H. B. Irving’s new version of “Jekyll and Hyde,"
written by Comyns Carr, is more melodramatic even than
the book, and will take a bit of staging when Australia
sees it. For Jekyll twice changes to Hyde ana twice
Hyde changes to Jekyll, in Sight of the audience ; and,
while the one is a fine figure of a fashionable doctor, the
other is “a snarling ape-like character, with slobbering
lips and twitching fingers, hump-backed, and with his
hair falling over his evil eyes." It sounds almost as
pleasant as that wonderful play which
Charley Holloway put on at the Criterion (Sydney) in his
latter days.
THE SIMPLE LIKE.
[FOR THE BU LLETIN.]
You follow it up in a serious way, and it’s always some
distance ahead—
Like the epic you’re going to write some day, when
you’re sure of your daily bread.
In the Simple Life of the lone sea-beach, or out on the
forested hills,
Simplicity’s more or less out of your reach,
For there’s no one to open the beer for you there,
And there’s no one to care if you live upon air—
No, and no one to garnish your grills.
And the sun may rise rocketing, crimson and gay, but
you’ll turn in your blanket and groan,
As you find, when you wake, that you’ve fallen away
from the bunk of rude sacking you’ve sewn ;
And the Simple Life seems to be complex and cold as
you smuggle the rag round your ears,
And the Simple-Life creeping-things clamber in, bold,
While your pillow of bracken climbs down to your waist.
Simple Life is disgraced as you speak in your haste—
O, the language the early bird hears !
The Arcadian life is just the right thing while the
creek-fish ’ll come to be snared,
When never the tree-leeches lean down and cling to the
fisher-chap, all unprepared ;
When the red apples swing in remote orchard-spots, low
down on the murmuring boughs,
And the farmer-man never gets angry and pots
The stranger that wanders, in moonlight, too near.
Simple Living ! Yes, here do you board up your beer,
And your milk is the foreign tinned-cow’s.
In the Land of Plain Living the milkmaid is found, with
her dear elbows dimpled and bare,
With a pair of blue optics that look at the ground when
you say there’s true gold in her hair,
And the Simple-Life crank thinks it’s part o’ the game
(for he’s wandered in thousands o’ bars)
To give fair Jemima an up-to-date name,
When, behold ! a huge Bill with a sledge-hammer paw !
‘ And you yell for the Law as Bill lands on your jaw,
And your sky’s full of comets and stars !

“Freelance ”: You can’t make some of the |
old hands at Glenrowan (Vic.) believe that Dan
Kelly was ‘>urned in the pub there after the gang
■•. as surrounded. I met four of the Oldest In-
habitants the other day, and when a suggestion
was made that Daniel had been roasted in the
een, there was a grunt all round. “ No,’’ said
one. “Dan Kelly wasn’t shot and he wasn’t
burned. He is still alive, and he isn’t very far
away. I have often seen him and spoken to him
sine.* be was supposed to be a corpse, and I
couldn't be mistaken, because I have known him
ever since he was a boy.” But, then, no Oldest
Inhabitant ever can be mistaken. Can he?
Iloberfc McNab, the M.L. ex-Minister
whose hobby it is to certify the truths or explode
t::e lies Of M.L.’s early history, has tracked a set
of French documents which appear to prove that
l>efori; Captain Cook’s time charts of at least a
portion of the M.L. coast-line had been prepared
by a Frenchman. When Cook first sailed up the
east coist of the North Island, in 1769, there was
lying at anchor in Lauriston Bay, near Man-
gonui, the. French vessel Saint Jean Baptist.e,
commanded by De Surville. But, peculiarly
enough, no serious attempt has ever been made
to ascertain the why or wherefore or the results
of that expedition. In fact, the M.L. Year
Book for 1909, while reporting that De Surville
sighted the north-east coast of M.L. on a voyage
of discovery in 1769, says: “ There is no record of
any visit to Maoriland after Tasman’s departure
until the time of Captain Cook.” McNab, how-
ever, recently made for Paris, and under the dust
of years, discovered De Surville’s journal, a col-
lection of that sailor’s correspondence, his charts
of the coast-line which he had explored, and a
number of plates of Maoris and Maori imple-
plements. McNab is now having translations
made of the documents.

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have-not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use ; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache—a
bright cheery sense of perfect - health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite
independent of Aperient Medicines.

Tortured by Stomach & Liver Trouble.
“Both myself and husband have derived the greatest possible benefits
from Bile Beans,” says Mrs. Burr, residing in Pinkenba, via Brisbane, <£.,
“ and we have kept them as our general family medicine for years.
“Personally, I was afflicted with terrible stomach and liver trouble. I
used to experience the most agonising pains in the region of the liver,
spasms caused through wind in the stomach, and vomiting. Life to me
became nothing but a misery, and I was forced to employ someone to carry
on my household duties. I consulted doctors, but the treatments prescribed
failed to restore me to health, and I can assure you I was in a pretty bad
way when I decided to see if Bile Beans would do me any good. They
proved the remedy I had been long seeking, for Bile Beans quickly relieved me of
all pain, rid me of the wind, and toned up my system admirably.
“My husband suffered from a severe attack of windy spasms, and I
thought he would have died with the pain, but a couple of doses of Bile
Beans restored him to the best of health.
“ The excellence of our general health testifies to the great merits of Bile Beans,
and you are at liberty to use my foregoing testimony for the benefit of
other sufferers, if you wish.”

im-
position held by Pears* Soap for

Teerce McCann.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT the farm of Haughton Vale, not so very
long ago,
Irish-blooded Teerce McCann
Worked a while as handy-man.
It was summer at its height, such a summer as
we know
When the ground beneath the feet
Feels like embers all a-glow.
And the hills, in waves of heat
Where the miraged waters meet,
Look like pleasant summer islands, row on row.
All the grass was brittle-dry, all the long grass of
the Spring,
And the narrow water-ways
Were like little strips of baize,
Green with rotting leaves of trees and the slime
of many days,
And the forest-birds were dumb, they had no
desire to sing;
Where the densest shade was cast,
There, with wide throats throbbing fast,
There they perched and panted, parched, each
with drooping head, the wing
Loosely held and quivering.
And the giant eucalypts, from the north wind’s
breath of fire
Seemed to shrink within themselves, as a child
from sudden ire,
Turning leaf by leaf a-curl
In each eddy’s blistering whirl
Till, like moths, they drifted down,
Crisp and cracked and sere and brown,
Filling all the stifling air ’neath the close dense
forest trees
With an odor ominous of inhuman tragedies.
And the story thus began :
Teerce McCann was handy-man,
Was indeed the only man on the farm of Haughton
Vale,
When, on one dim mountain height,
At the yawning dead of night,
Lo, the fire fiend burst to light ’neath a fierce
north-eastern gale.
Where one moment all was dark
First a gleam as of a spark ;
Then an eagle, winged with flame, seemed to fly
O’er the tree-topped mountain crest,
From the lurid east to west ;
Till the sky-line leaped to life in a robe of horror
dressed,
Like a being sentient
On swift retribution bent.
All the spurs for miles around
(Haughton Vale is mountain bound)
With a wreath of Hell it crowned.
Then with lifted robes of haste
Through the long grass, brittle-dry,
Down the timbered slopes it raced,
And the trees that it embraced
As the gale went swirling by
Flung their burning leaves like flags, flags of flame
against the sky.
So the red disaster came
Till the spurs on either side
Seemed to be a flowing tide
Rushing down to flood the vale with a raging sea
of flame.
And the birds before its might,
Thrpugh the stinging, smoky air,
Fled the wild, amazing light,
Fled like winged ghosts to where
Denser shades were fiercely flung
From the trees where they had sung—
Fled till frantic wings were broken, and in tor-
tured heaps they fell
Screeching fear from choking throats
In despair’s discordant notes,
Till the red-fiend spake them silence with his
burning tongues of Hell.
So the red disaster came; and the herds before
its breath
Moaned the blood-moan as they raced from the
gaping jaws of death.
And the wild bush animals,
All the swift marsupials,
Joined the furious stampede with the mountain
warrigals,
And the footfalls of their fear,
As their agony began
With insistence dread and clear,
Broke the sleep of Teerce McCann.
On the rough slabs of his room.
Through the mid night’s conquered gloom,
Danced a red, dread messenger like a grim
malignant sprite ;
“ Mary, Mother ! ” low he cried,
Flung the rude door open wide.
Saw the flames with molten might
Under crested waves of smoke roaring in on
either side;
Saw, and faltered at the sight;
For the vivid face of night
Showed him Death alone deep-written in its
living lines of light.
And he faltered, shuddering, fora single moment’s
span ;
Then a flood of frenzied blood woke the heart of
Teerce McCann.
“ Mary, Mother .' ” Sudden fear
Served no longer to bewilder ;
Through the smoke wrack’s shifty fleer
Thought came to him swift but clear :
“ Save the mistress and the childer.”
Not a breathing-time of grace—
There was hero’s work to do—
Down the track as in a race,
Down the fire-edged track he flew ;
Wflere ; ' the little homestead stood, through the
frantic herds he dashed.
Spurned the garden creepers from him, through
the glaring window crashed. ■
“ Mistress ! Mistress ! Wake ye, wake,
For the Holy Mother’s sake !
Bpnny ! Gildy ! Come on wid me!” Through
the glare-lit rooms he sped,
Caught the children in his arms—
Laughing at the tire’s alarms—
“ Come with me!” And to the open every
living one he led.
Like God’s wrath made sentient
On swift retribution bent,
With insatiate desire
Came the all devouring sre.
“ To the creek ! ” the mistress cried ;
“ It would catch you in its stride,”
Teerce McCann made answer clear as the home-
stead burst a-blaze :
“ Take these sodden bags and keep in the shel-
ter of the drays.”
And the frenzied mother wound
Sheltering arms her children round,
Shrieking maddened prayers for mercy that the
flaming torrent drowned.
Teerce no words of pity gave—
Teerce McCann was there to save.
From a tank he tore the lid—and the flames
were in his hair—
Through the blinding smoke he pressed,
With the mother, babe at breast;
And the children, one by one, to the refuge swift
he bore,
And, with wondrous strength and care,
One by one he placed them there ;
One by one till they were safe and the tank would
hold no more.
Not one morel Teerce turned away.
“ P'r’aps the creek ! ” he seemed to say ;
Then with giddy steps he reeled where the sod-
den bags were thrown. . . .
And the raging sea of flame claimed the valley for
its own.
And the story thus is told, when the rescue party
rode
Into Haughton Vale next day, while the giant
trees still glowed.
With the Mistress Monaghan
And her children all was well ;
But of gallant Teerce McCann
Not a sign they found to tell
How he died or where he fell.
VICTORIA.

“The Lost Cat.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IHAVE met the Battler on many a track
and in many a woolshed hut, and rarely—
very rarely—doing any but the easiest
work. Until last summer I had never been in his
company over the liquor.
It was very warm at the pub, and several of us
had been having a drink in consequence. The
others went their ways, leaving me in the bar-
parlor. Presently I glanced across'the room, and
noticed, for the first time, an elderly man with
grey whiskers sitting in the far corner behind the
table. He said to me : “Ye haven’t gotter bit o’
weed? Thank ye! Gotter match?” I handed
him the box, and he calmly abstracted more than
half of its contents.
“ I hope you have a pipe,” I said.
“ Well, misther, to tell the trut’, I have wan ;
but it’s not much good. Mebbe, though, it’s good
enough for the likes o’ me. Ye haven’t a spare
wan ye wud be afther t’rowin’ away? Av coorse
not ; I see ye haven’t. I have seen yeer face
somewhere before. Is it ye that is manager av
that finestation beyant ?—Callipo Downs, I mane.
N-o-o-o? That’s sthrange then. I have seen yeer
face somewhere before. Ah, I remember—in the
pickchers. That’s it—the pickchers in the Pas-
thokjalists’Review. I can’t be mistook.”
Now, that was nice—a simple drover chap ljke
me to be taken either for the manager of one of
the finest stations in the West, or raised to a pin-
nacle of grandeur by being pictured in the best of
pastoral company. It called for a drink at least;
and the old chap asked for a long beer. He took
it over to his corner, and by the time I had paid
for it he had apparently drunk it off, for his glass
was empty.
He said : “ I was that dhry that I cudden’t
wait fer manners.”
I was still in the glow of flattered vanity, so I
said : “In that case have another.”
He took it and placed it before him on the
table, without drinking. He said : “ I know ye;
but ye don’t know me, I can see. I am the
* Losht Cat.’ ”
“ ‘ Lost Cat ’?” I asked. “ What’s that ? ”
He seemed rather disappointed, I thought, that
I did not know about the Cat. He explained ;
“I am an old an’ well-known Battler, an’ t got
me profissional name be always sayin’, when I
heard those others talkin’ about their fine an’
numerous thricks, ‘Alas, poor me!,l have but
wan thrick, an’ if that fails me, I am indade a
Losht Cat.’ I have remimbered that frum the
days av me youth, when I was in the second book.
I am King av the Battlers, now that the Gintle-
man has retired. I was wid him to the lasht.
Will ye hear all about him ?”
I had plenty of time on hand, so I listened.
■ “Ye must know that in my profission I have
never been aiqualled. An’ there’s Double Tooth
Jock—he hasn’t been aiqualled aither. Three
years ago lasht shearin’ the Gintleman (an’ he
railly is a gintleman), he wasn’t to be matched
annvwhere. When I gotter know him well I cud
never undershtand’why hevtuk to the tlirack. It
seemed to me as if he was always on the. luk-out
for somebody. In regard to skill, there was little
betwixt us in our different ways, an’ everybody
reckoned it was a toss-up which was the King av
the Battlers. It was to settle that matther that
me an’ Double Tooth an’ the Gintleman met
wanst —it was over three years ago—to thry an’
find out. So we med it up to have a thrial av
skill. The chief throuble was, to find a sootable
subject. God knows there are plenty av hard
cases in the West, but most av themes aisy to
ibate in wan wajr or another—that is, be a skilful
man. There’s not above a dozen so hard an’ so
knowin’ that they are avoided by all but the new
chum or the foolish. Aven they have a soft
shpot if it cud on’y be found. lam sure av that.
Well, as I said, we met an’ flogged the question
out, an’ at lasht it came down to a choice betwixt
a hard, flea-bitten Scotchman on the Bogan; a
blaggard av a Far Downer up near the Queens-

DON’T
Backache is Really
Kidney Ache.
Backache is really kidney ache :
the ache comes from the kidneys,
which lie just beneath the small of
the back. When the back is weak
and lame —when it ‘ e cricks ” if you
turn sharply or stoop—when it
burns with a burning ache, and
keeps you awake half the night —
when you cannot bend without a
stab-like pain taking you —when it
makes hard work of the least task
—give your kidneys help at once in
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
Doan’s Pills are 'a Special Kidney
and Bladder medicine ; they give
strength and tone to the kidneys
themselves, and so cure the cause
of backache, gravel, rheumatic
pains, watery swellings in the
ankles and beneath the eyes, urin-
ary troubles, dizzy spells, pains in
the limbs, spots before the eyes,
sallow complexion, etc.

A SYDNEY MAN’S
LASTING CURE.
Mrs. W. Benn, 46 Hanover Street, Waterloo,'
Sydney, says:—“l am quite convinced that I
owe my life to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
for this remedy cured me of Dropsy and other
symptoms of disordered kidneys. My ill-health
started with backache ; then I got urinary
trouble and dropsy. My back was always
aching ; the sharp, shooting pains were so bad
I would have hot flannels put'on to try and get
ease. The secretions were thick, and caused
intense pain. I was fit for nothing, feeling tired
out always, and I had bad headaches. My
legs and feet swelled to twice their natural size ;
I could not put my boots on, and I practically
lost the use of my legs. I was really very ill,
and nobody thought that I would ever get well.
I tried every remedy I could hear of, but got
no better. The doctors whom I consulted
could do me no good, and gave up my case
as hopeless. A friend advised me to use Doan s
Backache Kidney Pills, and I procured these
pills. The first few bottles gave me relief,
and 12 bottles completed my cure. lam now
quite free of the dropsy and backache, and the
secretions are regulated. Doan’s Backache Kid-
ney Pills have cured me, completely and per-
manently, for I have been quite well for 2-|
years now. I cannot sufficiently Praise Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills ; they saved my life.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all
Chemists and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per bottle

land border, an’ who was very religious ; or the
celebrated Molly Meagher in Queensland. We
put the three names in the hat an’ dhrew Mrs.
Meagher.
“The conditions, dhrawn up regular, was:
One feed at laste, or the same thing in the shape
av dhry tucker in the bags. Nothin’ to be paid
for be cash or work. An’ no threats or violence
to be used in anny way.
“Noneav us had ever seen Mrs. Meagher ; but
her record from other Battlers was a bad wan.
She was a widdy or grass widdy who had three
twinty-thousand-aere blocks on Boiling Downs
resumption. Her place was on the main road
down the river, an’it would have been a most con-
vanient place av call if on’y she had a soft shpot.
But no. All the dhrovers an’ Battlers had thried
their hands aither for grass or tucker, an’ she had
bate them all. She was a hatter, an’ seemed to
want no thruck with annywan. It wasn’t too
safe for horsemen aven to camp within cooee av
the place unless they watched. She d have
hobbles an’ bells off the horses, an’ they’d be
hunted to blazes. So everybody gave her an’ her
place the go-by. ’Twas said that she an’ her man
had been hawkers. He had cleared out an’ left
her with a kid an’ the cart, an’ had bolted to the
diggin’s at Coolgardie, an’ never come back. All
that is hearsay. She carried on the cart, an’ biine-
bye took up some country an’ did rale well. Then
she bought a place, an’ after the good prices set
in she made a pile. She worked the place on her
own, an’ ’ceptin’ at shearin’, had on’y two or three
lads about, an’ they were out on the run. That’s
what the Bagman’s Gazette had ter say about
her, with a lot av other stuff that’s not nearly
true. Alrhost every thrick had bin played there
be the Battlers, an’ with no success. One shearer
joker on a bike pretended to be givin’ notice av a
mob of bullocks cornin’ onter the place, an’ got
two feeds an’ a bunk in the cart-shed. She put
the police on to him, an’ he got fits. He was the
nearest to batin’ her that annywan had ever
heard of. Did I hear somewan callin’ ?”
I looked around, but there was nobody. In
that short time the beer had disappeared, and
only the empty glass stood before the Lost Cat.
“ I was wrong,” he said.
“You are pretty swift,” I replied, looking
meaningly at his glass.
“Ah, well, then, it’s sorry I am to be trouble-
some in that wav to the likes av ye. I must be
goin’. I was dhry.”
I wanted to learn more, for I had heard some-
thing of Mrs. Meagher. She really was some-
thing of a mystery. So I bought another beer.
“I have middlin’ stowage for beer when I am
dhry,” he said ; “an’ talk in’s dhry work.” He
took a pull at the beer and went on :
“Well, me an’ the Gintleman an’ Double-
Tooth marched off that day to find the lady,
takin’ six weeks to do the thrip. We lived all
the time like fightin’ cocks. Nothin’ could bate
the three greatest Battlers in the land whin they
were together. The more I sah av the Gintle-
man the more I wondhered, an’ the betther I
liked him. Oh, he had the ginerous ways wid
him ! If I had time I c’u’d tell you av some av
our doin’s. The way we tuk was always supposed
to be a hungry thrack, but we med a full-
belly wan av it, as fur as the cattle-counthry,
an’ that wasn’t too bad. We kep’ pretty quiet
along the way, an’ talked innercent when
we met other Battlers. We aven bate them now
an’ agen for weed. When we reached Boilin’
Downs,' we camped on the waterhole in the river,
on the other side from where Mrs. Meagher had
built her house. An’ then we dhrew for places.
In the dhraw, Double Tooth was first, me second,
and the Gintleman third. After a day or twos
spellin’—we wasn't in anny hurry, for we had
whips o’ tucker, an’ there’s plenty fish in that
hole—Double Tooth reckoned that he’d have his
thry. We didn’t ask him what his lurk was, but
we cud see aisy that he was goin’ ter be very
sick man when he came in sight av Molly
Meagher. It is well known that Double Tooth
can throw a fit an’ nearly die wid the best av
them. It was in the mornin’ when he left the
camp, an’ it was midday when he came back wid
his trousies torn, no hat, an’ as savage as a wet
hin. He threw his sliwag down an’ sez, ‘ Yeez
can have the game for me. She’s a hard-hearted,
decavin’ man-aiter. To luk at her you wud think
that she’s kind an’ gintle. I hurried me spruich
whin I found that out, an’ I on’y said ‘ Good day!,
afther climbin’ the verandy shtairs wid a groamn ,
an’ then I threw my best fit on the flure, an’
frothed at the mouth, an’ turned up me eyes.
She stud lukkin’ down at me for a while, and then
she sez, ‘ Ye can die much aisier on the grass
than on me clane veraftdy.’ So she pushed me
off wid her own hands, threw me sliwag onter
me, sooled the dog at me, an’ I was bit; an then
the kid threw at me an’ hit me wid a shtick
when I was lavin’. She’s a take-down. I
thought she was dead aisy whin I sah her.’
“ Naither me nor the Gintleman said a word.
We was thinkin’ hard. I cud see where Double
Tooth had med a mistake ; he went at it too
quick. He should have taken more time over the
introduction. All that day an’ part av the
night, I was thinkin’ an’ thinkin’ what I shud do.
It was a toss-up whether it’d be the cranky touch
or the jolly sailor man. They are me best bits.
“Man, woman or station hand, they are all glad
ter see the back av a looney, an’ tucker is no
object. It aven runs sometimes to a few bob fer
the thrack. I cud tell ye a fine tale av that little
lurk —’twas on the Bogan—but it’s not the tale
I’m tellin’. Then they all like a sailor. He’s bin
disciplinated an’ knows his supariors whin he sees
them, an’ he’s handy and honest. At long lasht.
seein’ that it was a woman I had dalin’s wid, I
med up me mind to be cranky ; so next day I
hung sthrings around me hat wid corks tied to
them, med up a little calico shwag, an’ put me
whiskers in little wisps all round me face with
soap. I shlung me billy to me belt. Towards
aven in’ I makes over to the house. She was on the
verandy whin I prances up, wid me hands an’ feet
an’head goin’likea Salvocaptin’s whin he’s worked
up be prayin’, singin’ an’ shoutin’ Hallelulia. I
sez to her, ‘God bless yer, sister.’ She sits an’
luks straight at me for a bit, an’ I must say that I
sah sympathy in her face or somethin’. She was
very kind-lukkin’, with her bright, blue eyes
which have the thrue Irish laugh in them. I sez
again. ‘God bless yer, sister.’ She rose up an’
sez, ‘Yes. me poor man, ye might well say “God
bless me.” Are ye hungry?’ I knew at wanst
that I was home. She sez, ‘Wait for a few
minyuts, an’l’ll fix things up for ye.’ She went
through the dure to the back, an’ prisintly back
she comes, an’, talcin’ me sthronglv be the arm,
sez, ‘Come to the back, me poor felly.’ I went
like a lamb. She kem to a dure, an’ openin’ it,
she gev me a tremenjous thump on me back
an’ a hoist wid her shouldher, an’, before I
cud turn round, I was locked in a little
room no bigger than me an’me shwag. I was
thrapped. I was bate at lasht. I was indade a
Losht Cat. She tould me through the dure that
she was sendin’ for the thraps in the mornin’ to
come an’ take me to the Loonattic Asylum,
Besides that, she laughed. Oh, I hated myself
then. I thried to let meself out, but it was built
to stand agen Battlers. It was the smoke house
where the hams was cured'. I got pretty mad an’
shtarted to perform, an’ presently up comes a
wisp av shmoke through the hole at the side an’
in a minyut I was chokin’. That did the thrick
for me, an’ I became dumb. I was let out in the
mornin’, afther breakfast a long time, an’ to this
day I hate to think how aisily I fell to a squat-
teress. Whin I got back ter camp I had to tell
the others some av the tale. Double Tooth on’y
shuk his head, an’the Gintleman sez, ‘’Twasvery
crude, me bye—l feared for ye.’ He asked one
question, ‘How old is the kid?’ I am not a
judge av children, so I tole him that it was risin’
two tooth, an’ that answers to about eight years
old in the humans, I hear.
“ The Gintleman sez that night, ‘ ’Tis my turn
to-morry, chaps, an’ I’ve bin thinkin’ she’s had far
too much shwag an’ billy-can to be taken aisy that
way. I am goin’ ter thry another way. I wud
give a trifle to know a little more av her aunty-
cedents. Ye min don’t know anny more than the
Mulga tales that s goin about concarnm her !
We both sez ‘ No ! ’ As a rule our information is
as full an’fuller than a John Copp’s about anny-
wan the profission’s intherested in. There’s
rnanny an' inanny a proud head would be carried
lower in this counthry, Mister, if the owners
on’y guessed how much av their privit his-
thry is known to the professional Bagman. The
Gintleman dolled himself up next mornin, an
then it was to be seen that he was the
railly fine man. He marched off, carryin’ himself
sthraight as a sojer, an’ there was no sign at all
av. the Bagman’s hump. We foiled him to the
edge av the timber, which ran up to fifty yards av
the house, an’ watched him go straight to the gate.
She came out on to the verandy an she stud an
lukked at him. When he got within talkin’ dis-
tance av her he shtopped too, an’they shtood an’
lukked at aich other. Then we seen him make
one jump oil to the verandy a‘n’they were in hdltiS.
Double Tooth hollered out, ‘Hey, there, Gintle-
man? That’s agen the agreement. There’s to be
no voilence.’ I sez, ‘Shut up. ye chump, that
ain’t voilence. It’s a calf that’s found his mother.”
They goes inside an’ afther awhile the Gintleman
comes down to the thrack wid his face all ashine.
We steps out to meet him an’ he says ‘I was
connn ter fetch ye chaps up. ‘How did ye get
on?’ asks. Double Tooth. ‘I have bate ye both
bad,’hesavs; ‘ but it’s be the quarest kind av luck
in the world. She’s wan I have been lukkin’ an’
lukkin’ for these six years. Come up an’l’ll in-
throduce ye to her.’ Me an’ Double Tooth lukks
at aich other. I sez, ‘l’m game,’ and Double
Tooth says the same, so we goes up. The Gintle-
man sez, ‘Molly, this is Mr. Torn, an’ this is Mr.
Jock. I do not know their names, but I have
known them these three months, an they are
good pals.’ I sez, ‘ I am the Losht Cat, at your
sarvice, Ma’m; an’ this is Double Tooth.’ She
laughs out sweet an’ loud, an’ sez, ‘ I liaye met
these gintlemen before.’ ‘Ye have that,’ sez I,
an’ ye bate us both, bad. ’Twas a match betwixt
the three av us. It is aisy to see who’s won. The
Gintleman is hard to bate annyhow.’.
“There ye have it all. She was an ould shweet-
heart who’d run away wid another chap, an’ was
sorry for it, an’ he heard that her'man had done
somethin’ an’ got in gaol, where he died She
changed her name an he was lukkin for her.
Annyway, that’s' what me an’ Double Tooth
gev out to the Bagman’s Gazette, an’ I suppose
it’s as thrue as most av the tales ye hear in the
Mulga. He left the profission at wanst, an’ she
became Mrs. Fitzgerald ; an’ they sold out an’
wint to the Ould Counthry. That’s all.”
I arose and called for more beer. In drawing
out the money I dropped a coin on the floor. I
stooped to pick it up, and happening to glance
over towards the old chap’s feet I noticed a row
of glasses all tilled with liqn->r. I found my coin
and looked over at him. “ Well,” I said, “ you
beat the band. You have a private bar under the
couch.”
The old fellow didn’t turn a hair. He said :
“Well, what av it? Yee’r the third man I
have told tales to to-day. I kape these to come
an’ go on. There is six av them, an’ ,y,e are quite
welcome to a dhrink out av wan. Ye will know
that a Battler always has a bit exthra up his
sleeve or undher the sate. Must ye go ? ”

A So ug of Complete Rest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LEAD me to a garden fair,
Full of scented blossoms rare,
Lay me in an easy chair.
Leavq me there.
Leave me there and on my chest
Let some ice be gently pressed;
I have labored—done my best.
Let me rest.
Take that saddle from my sight.
God be praised ! the morning light
Will not find me in full flight!
Rest to-night !
Save the midnight oil—and lamp;
Let me dream I am in camp,
Or aboard a rolling tramp,
Cold and damp.
Let the ghosts of all the miles
pass me in sore-footed files:
I will greet them all with smiles. ,
PqOr exiles /, i :.
Bring the spectres of each job,
Let my bygone bosses sob,
“Two-pound-ten !” and “ Thirty bob!’
In a mob.
I will listen in my sleep
To their offers small and cheap,
And ir.y snoring will be deep
In a heap.
Let me dream of work I’ve done
In the wind and rain and sun,
Far at sea or on a run ;
’Twill be fun.
’Twill be joy to wake and find
I have left it all behind. . . .
Now am I to rest resigned !
Drop the blind. . . .

“My little son suffered ter-

be disfigured for life. But no,
after taking five bottles of
