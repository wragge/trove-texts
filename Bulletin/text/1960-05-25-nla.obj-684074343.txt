IRON LIKE LACE
The really surprising thing about E,
Graeme Robertson’s Victorian Herit-
age: Ornamental Cast Iron in Archi-
tecture (Georgian House) is not what
a beautiful book it is; for, after all,
nobody is going to produce a kind of
art-book about cast-iron and make a
mess of it. It is not the profusion of
the illustrations; for, if 220 is a gener-
ous ration, the book was certain to
be illustrated. It is that, in patches
and as a whole, Robertson has managed
to make his letterpress interesting and
readable.
True, there would naturally be an
account of how cast-iron is cast, and
what is the difference between cast-iron,
wrought-iron and pig-iron, all of which
could be fascinating to anyone able to
understand it; and Robertson duly goes
into great detail about these mysteries.
But to anyone like the present reviewer,
to whom all technical processes whatso-
ever are utterly incomprehensible and
repellent, these pages must necessarily
be leaped-over as quickly as possible.
One did, in passing, learn why pig-
iron is called pig-iron. It is because the
old English iron-workers thought that
some comb-like arrangement used in
one of their incomprehensible processes
looked like “a sow suckling its young ”
so that you can have an iron sow as
well as “pigs.” But that is as far as
one got.
True again, you would naturally
have much architectural description,
whether of elegant old houses in Mel-
bourne or hideous fountains in Tas-
mania, whether of the Greek key-
pattern or the celebrated “rinceau”
design; but, though never as repulsive
as a mechanical process, architectural
description also tends to make pretty
diy reading. Usually only specialists
can follow it; and it is very rare indeed
to come across a writer who, like the
ever-magnificent Charles Dickens (in
his description of the Crystal Palace,
which Robertson quotes), can make
exciting architecture sound exciting.
True once more, the writer of such a
book as “Victorian Heritage” can
work-in as much social history as he
can persuade himself is relevant. But
this is a device which often is most
unscrupulously overworked; and one is
glad that, having almost decided to
write the history of Australia—he is
writing about iron-work in Australian
houses; therefore all Australian houses,
with or without iron, are almost rele-
vant —Robertson decided to drop that
line and recommend his readers,
instead, to M. H. Ellis, Morton Herman
and (“Australia’s Home”) Robin
Boyd.
There is a brief return to history in
some remarks on the Victorian land-
boom and subsequent depression in the
’nineties, where one is charmed to find
“The Bulletin” asserting that “The
policy of the continent at large should
be to declare Victoria an infected
province until its moral character has
been renovated and its reputation
restored"; but that is getting a long
way from iron, and it is as well that it
is brief.
Robertson’s great good fortune is
that some of the liveliest history which
his theme calls up is wholly and most
intriguingly relevant by the strictest
standards: for it is the history of iron
in Australian houses; in fact, of iron
houses.
Perhaps a purist could faintly object
to his account of the prefabricated iron
houses which were imported to Mel-
bourne in the ’eighties, along with the
portable iron churches ordered by the
Bishop of Melbourne and Coppin’s
Royal Olympic Theatre in Lonsdale
Street, which came to be known as the
“Iron Pot”: for these monstrosities,
though undoubtedly of iron, were of
corrugated-iron, which is hardly the
same thing as the delicate cast-iron
scroll-work which the book is really
about. But they are relevant enough,
and they make an amusing story.
A picture of one of the iron houses,
in Argyle Street, Fitzroy. shows an
austerity of design only to be matched
today by some of the humpies in the
furthest, hottest outback, where
corrugated-iron is still considered a
desirable building material; and one
is not surprised to learn that, despite
the felt lining, people found them
“insupportable”; “the scorching sun
draws the nails, curls the iron plates
and makes the interior as hot as a
baker’s oven.”
Still more intriguing, and incontest-
ably relevant, is the strange story of
the iron house, Corio Villa, still stand-
ing at Geelong. Prefabricated from
half-inch cast-iron boiler-plate, com-
plete w ith window-sashes of solid cast-
iron and veranda-posts “cast in the
most delicate filigree guilloche pat-
terns.” this remarkable building was
imported from Glasgow in 1855.
It adds considerably to its charm
that nobody knows who imported
it or who intended to live in it,
G. E. Drinnan, of Melbourne, who
has explored its history and whom
Robertson quotes, says that the thing
was simply dumped on the Cunning-
ham Pier, Geelong, with no information
as to sender or receiver. The foundry
from which it came was destroyed by
fire shortly after producing it; and it
lay unclaimed on the wharf for six
months until the port authorities de-
cided to get rid of it and sold it “to
Mr. Alfred Douglass for a small sum,”
That, then, not forgetting the man
who made the iron top-hat for an ash-
tray, and the Melbourne citizen who
still lights a kerosene-iamp each even-
ing in the lovely old iron lantern at
his gate, is the kind of material with
which the author enlivens his aesthetic
and architectural treatise; and for the
rest there is an intimate account of
the rise and decline of iron ornamen-
tation—very timely today, since cast-
iron and wrought-iron have become
something of a cult in many places—
with lyric descriptions of the best of
it and appropriate excuses for the
worst; and with the copious illustra-
tions everywhere to prove the points
and captivate the eye ... it really is
astonishing how this harsh, unsympa-
thetic material can be shaped into
such exquisite lacy patterns.
The book is centred on Melbourne
but roves over the rest of Australia,
with excursions to London, Paris and
New Orleans. It sells at eight-guineas
and is printed in an edition “limited to
1000 copies for world sale.”
The Guinness Anthology
Once again quite a few Australian
poets are included in the annual
Guinness Book of Poetry (Putnam);
and very pleasant it is to see them
there —John Blight, Vincent Buckley,
the New Zealander James K. Baxter,
David Campbell. Geoffrey Lehmann,
Ray Mathew, Judith Wright and one
or two others—keeping company with
their English and American con-
temporaries . . . looking neither better
nor worse than the others but, as they
should, since poetry is not an inter-
national competition, naturally taking
their place.
It really is extraordinary that we
should have had to wait so long for
this sort of Commonwealth or English-
speaking anthology—the sort of thing
which the British Council, if not a
private publishing firm, might have
undertaken years ago—and that now it
should be done by Guinnesses in the
name, presumably, of “public rela-
tions”; that queer phenomenon which
covers such a multitude of virtues these
days. But it is very well done; and the
more power to Guinnesses for doing it.
The Australian selection is, however,
curiously haphazard. The editors’
choice is limited to poems published in
England, so that those poets who do
not care to submit their work to Eng-
lish magazines and the unpleasant
chances of rejection, never appear in
this anthology.
Last year there was a good Aus-
tralian representation culled from the
Penguin “Book of Australian Verse.”
This year the possibility of inclusion
depended for the most part on the
chance that Charles Osborne, formerly

THE NEW HITLER
TT might be wondered by the unthink-
-*■ ing why, in view of his obvious
preconceived attitude and plans, Com-
rade Khrushchev, Russia’s rude and
noisy dictator, troubled to make the
trip to Paris which has just ended. His
behavior since his visit to France a
couple of months ago has been such
that it has been clear that he could
not hope to get what he wanted from
the Summit Conference —a split be-
tween the Nato allies and the perman-
ent dominion over East Germany with
the right to bully West Germany into
submission.
However, Paris offered him the
opportunity to talk to the world. He
knew that Western newspapers could
be depended on to hang on his every
word, whatever they might say in their
leading-articles.
But let there be no mistake about
the true nature of Khrushchev. He is
an arch-opportunist. When Stalin was
in power he was a Stalinist of Stalin-
ists, as witness utterances shortly before
World War II such as those aimed
against the “Rightists and Trotskyites.”
These were heads of the Soviet State,
including the Commander-in-Chief of
the armed forces, Ministers, Ambassa-
dors, heads of great departments. All
were alleged to be traitors, spies for the
British, poisoners and murderers in a
series of trials in which the rags of
them were produced in court apparently
hypnotised and willing to admit any-
thing. Said Khrushchev:—
These miserable nonentities wanted to
destroy the unity of the party and the
Soviet State They raised their
treacherous hands against Comrade Stalin
—our hope, Stalin —our desire, Stalin —
the light of advanced and progressive
humanity, Stalin —our will, Stalin —oyr
victory. r
Naturally, everybody concerned, ex-
cept those who had been helpful and
got off with slow extinction in the
Arctic wastes, was on that occasion
shot in the dungeons of the Lubianka,
including Tuchachevsky, the Com-
mander-in-Chief of the Red Army,
who was not even conceded a public
trial.
V\fHEN the Russians have accused
* * and shot thousands of their own
citizens, including a couple of Ministers
of Security, for spying and “provoca-
tion,” the idea that they could be
astounded and shocked at the idea of
a single American observation-plane
flying over Russia is too absurd to
contemplate.
It would take a large strefct-direc-
tory to hold the names and addresses
of their own supposedly admiring citi-
zens who have been put underground
for allegedly spying on the Soviet
Union, not to mention the hundreds of
citizens of other countries who have
been equally condemned. It would take
more than a dictionary of normal size
to catalogue the spies of Russia who
have been caught in other countries,
including Australia, where, as the
Petrov Commission showed, they
maintained an “illegal” spy-system with
master-spies in the Communist-party
organisation, and succeeded in inserting
agents into even the anteroom of the
Minister for External Affairs, Dr.
Evatt.
The M.V.D. had dozens of contacts
with code-names in Australia, and the
revelation of this fact caused little stir
among the press—indeed, in some
quarters it seemed that the associates,
innocent and otherwise, of the Russian
spy-system were regarded as the vic-
tims of a Menzies Government con-
spiracy designed to damage Labor
politicians.
The basic findings of the three
Petrov Commission judges were that
“from 1943 until at least February,
1953, the Soviet Union had in Australia
and was operating, probably continu-
ously, a G.R.U. (i.e.. Chief Military
Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry
of Armed Forces) ‘legal apparatus,’
an espionage organisation concerned
with the collection of military (naval,
army and air) information.”
This was apart from two M.V.D.
networks, complex and extensive, con-
cerned with the collection of diplomatic
and other spying outside the military
sphere. All these operations were run
from the Soviet Embassy.
A hundred trials have proved that
Russia obtained its knowledge of the
basic techniques of nuclear power
through spying and subversion for the
Soviet Union’s then wholly sympathetic
allies.
of these cases has moved the
heads of States to froth at the
mouth and make the kind of sho\y to
which Khrushchev has treated the
world. Nor has he ever before shown
this kind of simulated indignation at
a kind of behavior of which Russia
itself is the master exponent. But he
has simply regarded the Summit Con-
ference, as he regards the United
Nations, as a platform from which to
spread the kind of poison that will help
destroy the free world and advance the
world revolution.
Nobody fully familiar with Com-
munism and its tenets believed for one
moment that any real agreement could
be reached in Paris. All that Khrush-
chev intended was to lull the West into
security, to divide the Western Allies
on the subject of Germany, to acquire
a new slice of Europe {including
Berlin) permanently and, above all, to
influence the U.S. Presidential election.
nrHE world cannot know the full
A truth about the spy incident —
where the aircraft came down, how it
was brought down, or what the posi-
tion of the pilot is. He is denied the
right, inherent in international law, to
see the authorities of his own country.
He will be denied the right to defend
himself. He will be brainwashed until
he is no longer sane before he is placed
in a dock where he can be seen. But
Russian accounts are being broadcast
as if they were gospel, and there is no
doubt that the trial will be timed and
used to affect the American elections
and make the matter an issue. The
Americans are an emotional people
easily swayed by a sensational press.
Khrushchev has probably misjudged
public opinion. He has shown a brutal
cunning, a careful timing, and is no
doubt returning home with the belief
that by flexing his muscles and going
ahead with his plans for East Germany
at a time when the U.S. Government is
in process of change he can make him-
self master of the world.
Never has any dictator made a
greater mistake. The graves of megalo-
maniacs strew the roadsides of history.
And Khrushchev’s flaunting arrogance
marks him down as another customer
for the undertakers, another Hitler or
Tojo, just as unscrupulous, just as
brutal and just as vain.
There is a startling analogy be-
j tween Hitler’s capitalising of Polish
alleged spying as one of the pretexts
for launching World War II and
Khrushchev’s current tactics; also be-
tween Hitler’s torpedoing of the
Munich agreement and Khrushchev’s
wrecking of the Summit Conference. .


THE ATHEIST ANGEL
“As God —non-existent—is my witness, my hands are clean and my soul is pure!”


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Export Drive
Nothing dramatic happened at the
National Export Convention in Can-
berra last week (apart from one delegate
falling waist-deep into the moat sur-
rounding the Academy of Science build-
ing), even though Dr. Westerman at the
outset mentioned the necessity for an
“export explosion.” But the possible out-
come of the convention should not be
underestimated. Some of» the addresses
were excellent, even if not brutally
frank with the Government and between
yourselves,” as Trade Minister McEwen
suggested they might be. The discussions
among the delegates afterwards, in groups
here and there and during mealtimes
even in the planes taking them back to
their capital-cities —were much more
frank and down-to-earth than the formal
proceedings in the Academy of Science
building.
The chief value of the convention
could easily turn-out to be the “get-
togetherness” which it created rather
than the instruction and polite criticism
which were offered by the principal
speakers, excellent though some of these
were. Another value was the oppor-
tunity for viewing the political terrain
in Canberra.
The convention was organised by the
Department of Trade in a thoroughgoing
and capable manner, even if the unex-
pected sitting of Parliament during the
same week caused some accommodation
difficulties. The only vocal appearance of
the Treasury was that of Treasurer
Harold Holt at the black-tie dinner. Holt
spoke brilliantly and wittily. His attitude
was that McEwen's invitation for all con-
cerned to be “brutally frank with the
Government” was really an invitation to
be brutally frank with the Treasury. And
the Treasury’s response was mostly de-
fensive or brutally negative.
Yet, while things which have to be
considered by an exporting industry are
efficient production and effective market-
ing policy on its own part, at the same
time it will not succeed if Common-
wealth industrial and fiscal policy makes
it impossible for the industry to achieve
the aims of its own efforts.
It may even be beaten before it starts
either by arbitration awards or by taxa-
tion policy.
The Commonwealth arbitration system
appears to have regarded the export
industries in the past almost as a foreign
affair, and the Federal Treasury often
seems to have acted, in its taxation
policy, with the same efficiency and same
lack of imagination as an electronic
brain.
It appears to count the immediate cost
of any taxation concession as an irre-
trievable loss, and not one that, where
it gives material stimulus to industry,
as one that will more than repay the
Treasury through increased productivity
and greater national income. Yet it has
only to study the effect of taxation con-
cessions to the coalmining industry to
realise how intelligent taxation policy
can stimulate productivity and income-
earning, and, in the end, increase Com-
monwealth revenue.
It has rejected all attempts to have the
unique and iniquitous payroll-tax re-
moved, even if it were to be partly re-
placed by increased taxation on profits.
Payroll-tax, like Topsy, has “just
growed.” And the Treasury will do
nothing about the economically un-
natural undistributed - profits tax on
private companies—unnatural because it
strikes at the very means by which small
businesses may best grow ; that is,
through the plough-back of undistributed
profits. And on the score of inadequate
allowances for depreciation where the
cost of replacements has doubled or
trebled it is equally immovable.
A pretty good job has been done,
through Budgetary policy, of restraining
monetary inflation in Australia. But our
Budget planning tends to disregard
human equities and incentives; and there
are its weaknesses.
It is time that the Treasury realised
that, in an age where Government
revenues are of such proportions that
they are one of the most influential
factors in the operations of a nation’s
industries, it is not merely the job of
the Treasury to collect and protect the
revenue. It also has a major responsi-
bility in protecting the economy, with a
regard to individual equities as well as
large round national sums.
The Treasury is already the major
partner in any business enterprise; it
is time it became a working-partner.
If the export development programme
is to get anywhere it will be necessary
for the Treasury to abandon its inbred
economic policy—mothered by Canberra
revenue necessities and sired by depart-
mental expediency—and cast its mind
around the broader fields and aspects of
Australian activity. It has not come to
light with the concessions which
European Treasuries, knowing that their
countries have to export or die, have
been willing to concede. Yet there seems
little doubt that Australia has to start
giving earnest attention to the export
of manufactured goods. And in this field
we have none of the cost or inbuilt
quality advantages which attach to our
wool, our steel or our silver-lead.
Manufacturers are considering an
export drive at a time when wages have
had two big rises within 12 months, when
the removal of import-restrictions has
brought additional competition to the
domestic market, and when the effects
of the European Common Market are
becoming noticeable.
It is unlikely that Australian manufac-
turers will be able to compete overseas
with foreign products that are now able
to surmount the Australian tariff and sell
successfully here.
On the other hand, our lead, our steel,
other metals and minerals, our wool,
our wheat and our meat are highly com-
petitive overseas under fair conditions
of trade. And there are possibilities of
economic export of processed goods at
lower than domestic prices provided out-
put, overall, is increased considerably.
Sugar and butter are present examples.
At the Export Convention it was made
clear that there are no wide differences
between primary and secondary indus-
tries in the general aim of increasing
productivity and exports.
The convention did not discuss —at
least not in any “brutally frank” way—
the industrial arbitration system, the
exchange-rate or the Navigation Act,
which makes Australian coastal shipping
the preserve of the shipping and steve-
doring unions. There was an avoidance
of the political aspects of cost-inflation,
though there was much discussion of
managerial production efficiency in rela-
tion to costs.
But all these other things, plus the
attitude of the Treasury towards pro-
tecting the economy and not merely the
revenue, will have to be discussed before
we can hope to achieve the £440-million
lift in exports by 1965 which was the
basic aim of the convention. The winds
of economic change are blowing. And
they are not all Westerlies.
Percy Clarey
Ip Percy Clarey, M.H.R. for Bendigo,
who was given a State funeral in Mel-
bourne last Friday, had not been ill and
permanently crippled, he might have
been the man to lead Federal Labor out
of the morass into which it floundered
in the middle 1950’5.
On the other hand, if he had not been
a cripple—a rheumatic condition struck
him down when he was 16 —he might
not have been turned from sport to
the study and the hard work that carried
him so high in union leadership and
State and Federal politics. In his own
humbler field he fought down his dis-
ability as Franklin D. Roosevek did.
When his legs failed him he built-up
his intellect.
Clarey was 70 at the end. He did not
often speak in the Reps. When he did,
he commanded the same respect he had
earned as a union negotiator and presi-
dent of the A.C.T.U. until he went Into
the Federal House in 1949.
His claim to fame, however, was not
in his actual material achievements but
in his personality and outlook. He was
one of the very few Labor men of the
modern age capable of detaching his
politics from personalities, and he had
a faculty for negotiation, for setting-out
issues and for compromise that made him
one of the most useful rank-and-file
members of Parliament on either side in
times of crisis or difficulty.
A shrewd judge of character, calm
and smiling when the storm raged round
him, he was always reasonable and
always kind even to his opponents.
Without making his mark as a leader,
without seeking office in Parliament, he
was a great influence in caucus and a
considerable figure in Federal politics
until the last two or three years of his
life.
The Federal Labor party is not likely
to see his type again in an age when
the plums of selection go to the careerists
and the type of “Labor” man who com-
mands election funds.


The tributes, from union and political
quarters and outside, were more than
perfunctory. “The Clarey story,” said
the Melbourne “Herald,” “is a good one
for young men to study.”
Ebb-and-flow
All the intending participants in the
Summit-that-wasn’t having returned
home, the next move will be in the
United Nations, which is due to discuss
Russian complaints about American
air-spying this week.
As usual in Communist tactics, there
is a proper publicity-setting—the repre-
sentative on the U.N. took the oppor-
tunity on the eve of the Security
Council meeting to present U.N. with a
bronze statue of some Russian hero
hammering a sword into a plough-
share.
Moscow has followed the normal
Communist tactic of “ebb-and-flow” as
set - out in Leninist doctrine. Advance
with a roar of rage which gains a little
ground; then,.while the world holds its
breath in terror, smile and slink away,
leaving the enemy you have confounded
full of hope that you were only bluffing.
As usual, this has worked with much of
the world press.
At the same time, the principle of
alternative action as between Asia and
Europe has been operating. While China
makes a row, seizes Tibet, bombards
Quemoy or invades India, the Russians
or their satellites deploy for a big move
somewhere else. Khrushchev does the
same sort of service for China.
It has been suggested here before that
the Summit was a covering - operation
And it seems certainly to have distracted
the attention at least of press and radio
from the journey of Chou En-lai, the
uprising of Communist effort in Indo-
China and the imminent signs that the
Communists’ spearhead may soon be
thrust southward once more towards
Thailand and Malaya in an attempt to
engulf South Vietminh and presently
Burma and Malaya.
Seato nations are obviously aware of
what is going on. Recent exercises and
the meeting due this week advertise their
fears.
The Communist method is a continual
diversion of attention to cover opera-
tions. But, to quote Lenin’s words {vide
Stalin), the question is ever in their
minds: “Where in the near future will
the chain [i.e., of “imperialism”] be
broken?” Their answer: “It will be
broken where the chain of imperialism
is weakest, for the proletarian revolu-
tion will be the result of breaking the
chain of imperialism of the world front
at its weakest link.”
The Presidential election in the United
States is at present foremost in Khrush-
chev’s mind, but it is not known what
the newly militarised Government of the
U.S.S.R., what Marshal Malinovsky, with
his vast influence in China, or what
the Communist East have in mind when
the East German peace is deferred and
there is talk of a Summit Conference
six or eight months ahead.
Perhaps that King Winter’s armies are
worth five-million men to the U.S.S.R.
in war, as was proved in World War 11.
Perhaps the effects on Western morale
of a few more months of producing
confusion in the outside world and of
using a venal Western press and radio
and a noisy U.N. and Labor opposition
to promote more division and criticism
among the Western nations and weaken
their defences before putting pressure on.
One thing is certain: It is a basic
Communist tenet, taught without fail and
exhibited without fail in every move that
has ever been made from Moscow, that
propaganda must always lead-up to or
go hand-in-hand with action.
It would be stupid to believe that
Khrushchev’s bellowings are -an excep-
tion to the rule which has been proved
good throughout 40 years.
Liquor in Victoria
Having sent Judge A. M. Fraser, of the
Licensing Court, abroad last year to
reaffirm what everybody already knew
about the 6-o’clock swill, the Victorian
Government is doing nothing to change
it. It is not acting yet on two of his
Honor’s central recommendations —10-
o’clock closing and a “tavern” class of
licence for establishments that would be
decent drinking-houses and wouldn’t pre-
tend to be anything more than that.
It is, however, showing enough back-
bone to change some of the more laugh-
able and iniquitous Victorian liquor
laws.
Measures Chief-Secretary Arthur Rylah
has tabled in Parliament include provision
for more restaurant-licences, which will
carry the right to serve any drink except,
curiously, beer, between noon and 10
p.m. Wine-saloons are to be blotted-out
within two years unless they also qualify
for .restaurant-licences. Hotels may get
supper-licences from 10.30 to 11.30; and
both for these and for restaurants and
hotel dining-rooms there may be an
extra half-hour “period of grace.”
One thing Rylah’s introductory speech
did bring out is that he personally is in
favor of later closing of bars, which, he
said, had not brought people in other
States to “ruin and damnation.”
Rylah has thus committed himself
further than politicians, and especially
politicians in office, usually care to go.
But the Government will do nothing
about 10-o’clock closing while the Liberal
policy is for no change without a referen-
dum. As no referendum is intended
either, yet, the 6-o’clock closing that
arrived as a war emergency in 1916 may
still have a few years to run.

Commonwealth Marriage Bill
The Marriage Bill introduced into the
House of Representatives on Thursday
night is really complementary to the
Divorce Act passed a few months ago.
After all, if there is to be a uniform
Federal law governing the ending of
a marriage-contract it is not logical to
have six sets of laws regulating the
initiation of the contract. Attorney-
General Barwick, who introduced the
bill, explained that its chief objects were
to fix a minimum age for marriage—
higher than the ages permitted under
existing State laws —and to ease the law
regarding the legitimation of children
born out of wedlock.
The ages fixed by the bill are 18 in
the case of males and 16 for females,
though in very exceptional circumstances
permission for earlier marriage may be
granted by a judge or magistrate. Sir
Garfield said that a marriage of imma-
ture people solely to ensure that an
expected child was born in wedlock was
“not in the real interests of the child
or the parents or the community.” He
felt that the provision would remove the
pressure to enter into a forced marriage
in such cases.
The legitimation clauses provide that
a child born out of wedlock shall be
legitimated by the subsequent marriage
of the parents, irrespective of whether
there existed any impediment to the
marriage at the time of the birth. Under
the bill bigamy will become a Federal
offence and a child born of a void
marriage will be legitimate if either of
the parties believed on reasonable grounds
that the marriage was a valid one.
The second-reading debate on the
Marriage Bill will not take place until
the Budget session. It will be treated
as a non-party measure and members
will be free to vote in accordance with
their own consciences as was the case
with the Divorce Bill.
Melbourne's Underground
Among the businessmen of the heart
of Melbourne there has been some
falling-off of enthusiasm for the elusive
underground railway since it has become
apparent that they would be required
to meet a large share of its cost.
The State Government is so far stick-
ing to its plan that two-fifths of the
cost should be met by City of Melbourne
ratepayers. The City Council’s counter-
argument now is that one-fifth of the
money should come from all property-
owners who benefit from the suburban
train-network.
The total cost, now estimated at
£3O million, goes up a few million each
year while nothing happens in the way
of actual work. The City Development
Association, powered by the big retailers,
and which used to be full of eagerness
for the underground railway, is now
urging more expert advice and other
delaying tactics. In other words, every-
body is now convinced of the need of
an underground railway in Melbourne,
30 years after its time, provided the
other fellow finds the money.
The present probability is that 1970,
by which time Melbourne may have
2|-million people, will not find the under-
ground railway finished. Or perhaps not
even started.

Oole fan - letter from my first article

Sister Tutor had to laugh. “Yes, I do;

After I had been lecturing on sterilisa-
tion, the new nurse boiled all the thermo-
meters. It was wartime, and we couldn’t
get replacements.” “That’s not as bad
as what happened to me during the war,”
Matron put in. “We had a group of
Red Cross girls, and one eager beaver
found out that nobody had time to clean
the patients’ teeth ; she gathered them
all in separate mugs, to be quite hygienic,
took them to the kitchen and put each
mug to boil on the stove. You can
imagine the lumps of stuff that was all
that was left of the plates, with teeth
dropping off or sunk into the middle.
The poor patients had to be fed soft
foods until we could get them new teeth.
For a good „mapy it was a blessing in
disguise; but none of them admitted
that they were lucky to get brand-new
teeth for nothing. The girl left the
nursing and joined the occupational-
therapy department, where thoroughness
can’t get you into trouble.”

SECOND-CHILDHOOD
“The general-secretary of the N.R.M.A.
urged the introduction of a road-satety educa-
tion plan for pedestrians, particularly elderly
ones: ‘Too many senior citizens are becoming
the victims of traffic hazards,’ he said.”
In second-childhood you old men
Who totter, stagger, grope and stalk
Will have to go to school again
And learn once more to crawl and walk
And, more particularly, stop
Without the presence of a cop.
When Sydney streets seem unpoliced *
Yet motorists give me right-of-way,
Nine times out of ten, at least,
On a corner I survey
A lonely copper lost in thought,
Standing around and doing naught.
Yet, while he’s there, those charioteers
Who stare you down or run you down
Become a lot of perfect dears,
The nicest, sweetest men in town,
And wave you on: “What! Us go
through ?
No! After you, sir! After you!”
But coppers can’t be always there—
Then Nature has to take its course:
Some dotard takes the evening air
Where lights flash by like lines of
force ;
He leaves the kerb and bites the dust
As those resisting Progress must.
And so, you hunks of vile senility,
It’s time you went to special schools
To learn a little more humility,
Or stayed at home and studied rules
To save the hard-pressed motorist’s
time
And leave the cops to cope with
crime.

Tt was a very close shave, and both
vehicles pulled - up. One was a
small car driven by a woman, the
other a baker’s van. They both got out,
and the poor baker was shaking like a
leaf. The woman approached with pur-
poseful step and began to question him.
No, he wasn't insured. Then an event
such as this should be a lesson to him.
What would he have done if something
serious had happened to him? Still
dazed, the baker found himself insured
on the spot. It was only as the woman
was getting back into her car that he
came to himself. “Hey!” he called. “Do
you want any bread?” —“Sunray.”

was crowded, and we were forced to sit
on opposite sides of the aisle. Occa-
sionally during the service she smiled
happily at me . . . When the service
came to an end I rushed to break the

and disappeared in the direction of home,
leaving her friends and me stranded.
She wouldn't face us for many days,

“Sonia Rumee”: Secondhand-dealers

uppercrust establishment in Melbourne’s
Collins Street invites patronage by

Old Masters go for five greenbacks

wishing to be able to caution him against
the belief that, even overseas, all is
ancient if it’s prefixed “antique”!

them, who was a bit hard of hearing,
held it up to her ear, flicked the catch,

“Judee”: When Parramatta (N.S.W.)
District Hospital was established a

was to buy a table, which was used in
the operating-theatre, and in the dining-

time, no doubt to show-off the wonder
of the decade, the medical-superinten-

I reached the top of the hill

has had a steeple before, and
what with the modern practice
of prefabbing ’em in gleaming
aluminium and lifting the
completed job into position
with a towering crane, and
the steeple being undeniably
rocket-shaped and visible over
the hill though the rest of the

worthy more for their candidness than


their utility. But we were spurred-on
to dinkum efforts when we heard that
one of the mob in a nearby office had
landed the then staggering sum of £5O
for making the suggestion that they hack
off the first two syllables of the notice,
“Gentlemen”—an economy that operates
to this day. My own suggestion, that the
outsize suggestion-box, built optimisti-
cally to hold some hundreds of dropped-
in papers, should be replaced by a
smaller one failed to open the coffers.
Some \1 months later a smaller box did
appear, and I promptly claimed. Dis-

Intentions here of sovereigns take

shovelled-up the weight (mixed with a
heck of a lot of Queensland) when gully-

thrill of having it shovelled out to me
in the form of sovereigns as I did on
my first experience of the lure in decent-
sized quantities. Before Kaiser Bill’s
war coastal ships were paid monthly,
and it was the practice of the purser
to take the dip (me, in this instance)
along to the bank and draw the dibs,
To my surprise the gold was weighed-
out into canvas bags which wouldn t
have been of much use in a stick-up. To
allay my doubts, the Bloke made me
count it all when we got back to the

radio transceiver, an explosive against
a crash in enemy territory and, exter-
nally, studs to select the frequency in
use. Tracking by radar (Radio Aid
Direction and Range) relied on the
reflection, by the aircraft, of the trans-
mitted signal, and the 1.F.F., triggered
by the incoming signal, boosted the
reflected wave, enabling identification to
be made by the size of the blip on the
observer’s screen. The metal plates, or
cams, applied to flashing beacons. The
red ones (“pundits”), as distinct from the
white (“occults”), were the roving type,
but only between the prescribed posi-
tions within 10 miles of the controlling
airfield. They would, after exchanging
letters or colors of the day, assist aircraft
in distress, indicating the direction of
the airfield, serviceability and enemy
activity in the area, etc., by using a
light layout.

only once has he been embarrassed by
Australian hospitality: “They invited

delightful drive, a beautiful spot up on
Kurrajong where we were to have our
meal. It could have been such a splendid
outing, you know and then they
handed me your traditional Australian
dish. It was so awkward. I could not
have eaten it, but I had to pretend I
had. Fortunately, there were views to
be admired and I wandered away and
managed to drop it over a gully.” Our
traditional Australian dish, he says, is a
cold meat-pie swamped in tomato-sauce
VIRTUOUS VESTMENTS
“Here is clothing and undies to take the
eye, in materials which you will be quick to
see have sterling character.” — Rag-ad.
Time was, when we carried big slocks
Of undies and blouses and frocks,
But they never were worn by society,
Because they had peccable ways
Which earned them severest dispraise.
Guilty, they, of a gross impropriety.
We had three-way-stretch girdles and
bras.
And the rest of the etceteras
Which, while owning an air of some
suavity,
Were dissolute, profligate, base ;
Even though they consorted with lace
They would practise disgraceful de-
pravity.
A disorderly vest is a curse,
A scandalous bodice much worse ; *
Though it may seem, at first glance, so
sensible,
A skirt can develop, with wear,
A habit of flouncing, a flair
For malevolence quite reprehensible.
We found we were losing our trade
To others whose clothing was made
Of stuff that was wholly unblameable ;
So, on a decision abrupt,
We diced all that clobber corrupt,
Its character quite irreclaimable.
So come! Try our corsets. You'll find
They are virtuous, worthy, refined,
And have dispositions adorable.
These slips of ours cannot now slip
Into waiting iniquity’s grip,
Nor frocks act in manner deplorable.
Our gussies stand up to the test
Of character —none but the best;
Our girdles are shorn of rascality.
And very uplifted you’ll be
By our latest in bras, for, you see,
They’re all of the strictest morality !

Fishing With Lolo
“Make Very Afraid
the Fish”
By CHARLES MacGREGOR
< ‘\A7'7 ELL h ave a week’s
\V / vacation at Easter,”
W I remarked over the
breakfast pap a w .
“We could go and camp down
at Nuku . . .”
“What about fresh water?”
asked my practical mate.
“We could get it over from
Tobias’s trading-station at
FaleVai.”
That far fairy island of
Nuku, the very island of
dreams from out of a song,
was about five miles down the
harbor of Vavau, and only
half-a-mile across the water
from the steep, jungle-clad
island where Tobias, the old
Scandiwegian runaway sailor-
man, had eaten the lotus for
more than thirty years.
Tobias, sun - bleached,
wrinkled and kindly, would
probably “come oop” in the
launch for our gear. And the
natives would know it, for the
Kapa Kalasini (Kerosene Can)
was a byword for its loud
“pop, pop, popping,” to be
heard from halfway down the
harbor.
Tobias had had some trouble
with his gearbox, and, no spare
parts being available, he had
coupled the propeller-shaft
directly to the crank-shaft, so
that the engine was always in
gear. Once, when he was leav-
ing Neiafu to go home, the
motor had died a few hundred
yards from the beach. When
he got it started again it back-
fired and went full-speed
astern, and two hefty Tongans
on the tiller had a strenuous
steering-job till Tobias heard
their yells above the din and
stopped her just in time to
prevent a collision with the
boats at their moorings.
After that the natives called
her “Uo”—the shiny lobster—
. . because she swims back-
wards.”
“Lolo could come along and
run the Kerosene Can.”
“Oh, yes, Lolo will come —
you couldn’t stop him! Tui
had better come, too ; they’re
both anxious to improve their
English.”
"C very day saw the flutter of
Lolo’s white vala, his
bright, eager face, and his offer-
ing (mei of a) of native garden-
fruits, rose-apples, Tongan
“almonds,” a green chameleon-
lizard to enhance our grana-
dilla-vine, fish for the pan and
all sorts of oddities from the
reef, rare shells, box-crabs,
turret-fish, baby turtles, an
appalling square cowfish with
horns and frilly tail, slate-
pencil sea-urchins, and all such
biological specimens in which
a crazy white man would
assuredly be interested.
Lolo’s own requests were
very few: a bit of help with
his English; an occasional
small commission, such as large
tan boots from New Zealand
for his brother
Jione; while he
was delighted with
a stiff-covered ex-
ercise - book for
his notes, a box
of colored pencils
and a sharpener
with which to
“mow"' them, and,
best of all, a
large self - starting
spoon - lure with
which he caught
several large
barracuda and
oceanic bonito.
Oh yes, Lolo
would come!
So would the dreamy Tui,
and so would Tobias’s half-
caste daughter Fefita—ostens-
ibly to mind our toddler, but
actually to wander about like a
Polynesian fowl, to get bored
and swim home across one
of the deepest channels in the
harbor. The great black velvet
eyes of Tui were wide with
consternation when she did,
but his wailing. “Oh
wee ah wee! ” was
cut short with Lolo’s
disgusted “Sa’a!
What shark would
bother about Fefita?”
The two boys, go-
ing ahead, had woven
a new coconut - leaf
roof and walls on the frame-
work of an abandoned native
hut, and cut tracks through the
jungle growth to the glaring
white-coral beach.
Giant pandanus for fa)
reached long phallic roots
right to the water’s edge and
hung raggedy leaves to provide
scant shade. Towering coco-
nut-palms lifted rust-red trunks
against the limelight-green
shallows and the purple depths
over the reef.
Yet amid that heart-breaking
loveliness a rainbow had to
climb down over the jungle-
green of FaleVai, to stand with
its feet in the brilliant waters,
then vanish like the very spirit
of beauty.
T OLO rowed us and all our
gear ashore from the good
ship Kerosene Can, and Tui

POLITICAL POINTS
Queensland’s election campaign is in
its final week, and there doesn’t seem
to be much doubt as to the outcome.
Nicklin and Morris are confident that
their Country-party-Liberal coalition will
be given another term, and despite his
professed optimism, A.L.P. leader
Duggan is probably planning for three
more years in Opposition. Labor’s real
objective is to capture as many as pos-
sible of the Q.L.P.’s 11 seats with a view
to rebuilding the party.
Despite his optimism, Nicklin isn't
relaxing the pressure. Acting Prime
Minister McEwen will have addressed
five meetings by Wednesday night, and
P.M.G. Davidson, Federal Health Minis-
ter Cameron and Primary Industry
Minister Adermann have also been lend-
ing a hand. The poll will be held on
Saturday.

On appeal the N. S. Wales Supreme
Court reduced the life-sentence of Leslie
Newcombe for manslaughter of prison
warder Cecil Mills at Emu Plains to 15
years’ penal servitude. The appeal of
Kevin Simmonds was dismissed. These
are decisions with which few people will
quarrel. Newcombe was party to a brutal
and callous killing, but most will agree
with the appeal Bench that the part
played by Simmonds was much more
serious than that of his wretched partner
in crime.

While Khrushchev was shouting abuse
in Paris the still, small voice of the
United Nations Association was announc-
ing that, in its view there should be real
reductions of armaments, complete
destruction of all nuclear-weapon stocks
and the means of delivering them, and
“the beginnings of a small U.N. Security
force, strong enough to deal with local
disturbances.” Nobody even took time
off to laugh.

Purchase of a controlling-interest in
Mirror Newspapers, Ltd. (formerly Truth
and Sportsman, Ltd.), of Sydney, by
News, Ltd., of Adelaide, adds several
additional newspapers to the Rupert
Murdoch chain, and gives it representa-
tion, daily or Sunday, in every mainland
capital-city. It also adds to its TV
interests. The reason why O’Connell
Pty., Ltd., which was financed by Sydney
“Herald” in its purchase of Ezra Norton’s
shares in Truth and Sportsman, Ltd.,
decided to sell-out to News, Ltd., will
arouse as much speculative comment as
the original O’Connell purchase did.
Maybe of significance was the prior entry
of Rupert Murdoch into the Sydney free
suburban-newspaper game by the pur-
chase by News, Ltd., of Cumberland
Newspapers, Ltd., for £1,000,000. Cum-
berland publishes 28 N.S.W. newspapers,
all issued free, with a total estimated
circulation of 500,000 a week.

South Australians seemed rather sur-
prised that the bill to increase Parlia-

nationalise radio and television. Calwell
used to advocate this, and presumably
still does. And it isn’t likely that Eddie
has changed his mind about the banks.
HELPING OR HINDERING?


Tn the event of Khrushchev and East
Germany getting tough and block-
ading West Berlin the question of an
air-lift as in 1948 would arise. "This
matter was raised a few weeks ago by
an American reporter in an interview
with Willi Brandt, Mayor of West
Berlin. Brandt replied that one big dif-
ference between today and 1948 was that
now the city had stockpiles of food,
raw materials, coal and oil sufficient to
last close on a year. Mild rationing
would be necessary, but not anything
like 1948-49. For this reason the other
Western Powers would not be under any
immediate pressure to take drastic action.
There would be time to use political
means in order to fjnd a way out.

Rumors that Japanese mining - com-
panies were likely to be granted leases
of copper deposits in the Mt. Isa-
Cloncurry district have been scotched
by Queensland Mines Minister Evans.
The Minister said that he saw nothing
wrong in Japanese firms coming here
to finance treatment-plants, but “when
they talk of taking-out leases it is a
horse of a different color. There are
none available.”

Despite a Parliamentary career that
began in 1931, R. G. Casey has never
known what it is to sit in Opposition.
Now in the House of Lords as Baron
Casey of Berwick, he’ll never know. He
was on the Government side when he
entered the Federal House on- the fall
of the Scullin Labor Government.
Menzies sent him as Minister to
Washington in 1940, the year before he
himself fell. Most of the next eight
years, with Labor in power here, he
was in diplomacy—first for Canberra,
then for Whitehall, finally as Governor
of Bengal.
The fall of Chifley in 1949 saw Casey
back in the Cabinet he had left in 1940.
His knack of staying on the winning
side is a gift all old politicians may envy.

Sydney newspaper heading: “High

An examination of the report under-

worried seemed to be Comrade Healv

an exporter but an importer—of Kremlin
orders. There should be no freight on
Comrade Healy if he were exported to
his natural element—it would pay the
Commonwealth to carry him freight-free.

Walsh are able to claim the credit for
the Q.L.P. or at least for the Govern-

“Stromlo”: Although Ministers and
experts involved in the differences of
opinion on the results of the C.5.1.R.0.
rain - making experiments have been
polite to each other in their public state-
ments it’s a reasonable surmise that
there’s been some bitterness behind the
scenes. Many persons who had been
watching the tests with interest were
surprised when the new C.5.1.R.0. chief,
on the eve of departure for an overseas
conference, announced what appeared to
be spectacular achievements, because it
was known that a far longer trial period
had originally been planned. Trials are
to continue, especially as an independent
inquiry has indicated that there has been
some increase in precipitation but
precipitate announcements will, presum-
ably, be avoided.

Another commutation in Melbourne
last week seemed to suggest that the
death penalty, although still technically
in force, may never be used again in
Victoria. Labor won’t carry it out and
the Liberals don’t. Since Bolte came to
power in 1955, Cabinet has commuted
every death-sentence. None was carried-
out in the three preceding years of Labor
rule. The last execution in Victoria was
a triple hanging—of a woman and two
men for the torture-murder of an aged
bookmaker—in February, 1951. In this
particularly atrocious case, the then
Country-party Government let the law
take its course.

If Federal caucus had any principles
it would be in a spot over the hire-
purchase issue. Senate Labor leader
McKenna is said to be a director of a
hire-purchase company. Arthur Calwell
has repudiated the suggestion of
Treasurer Holt that trade-unions should
consider starting hire-purchase schemes ;
he denounces hire-purchase as usury in
which Labor wants no part. Nobody
will worry—Labor politics has become a
case of every man for himself.
Two months ago Cal well leapt blithely
. into the Latrobe by-election cam-
paign, but he won’t be approaching the
Bendigo contest with the same eager
enthusiasm. The late Percy Clarey won
Bendigo in 1949 and held it in four
subsequent elections, but his majority
was never a big one. In the last two
polls, with the D.L.P. in the field, only
his personal popularity enabled him to
hold the seat for Labor —in 1958 his
final lead was only 266.

Recently opened in the W.A. Museum,
the George Wieck Gallery takes its name
from Queensland-born Col. George
Frederick Wieck, who began his soldier-

Artillery and served in the Boer War.
After that scrap he transferred to the
Australian Instructional Corps, won his
commission, and was again on active
service in 1914 as captain and adjutant
of the 5th Light Horse, finishing with
the rank of Lieut.-Colonel. Most of
the remainder of his long Army career
was spent on H.Q. staff at Swan
Barracks, Perth ; he retired at the end
of War II. The new gallery houses a
collection of arms, both military and
sporting, which Wieck began getting to-
gether between the wars. Housed for
many years in the United Service Insti-
tution museum at Swan Barracks, it was
transferred to the W.A. Museum last

“Maitri”: At Newington College,
Stanmore (Sydney), Sir Charles Bickerton
Blackburn, Chancellor of the University
of Sydney, has unveiled a commemora-
tive stone to mark the start of the
Nesbitt Wing, a three-story building
named after Robert H. Nesbitt, chairman ot
the executive of the College council since
1951. When this new wing is completed, a
start is to be made on another Assembly Hall,
to be ready for the College Centenary celebra-
tions in 1963.
A man of great drive, R. H. Nesbitt was
born at Douglas, Isle of Man, in 1883 (his
father, T. H. Nesbitt, was a former Sydney
Town Clerk). Articled as a young man to
Lloyd’s Marine Insurance in London, R.H.
came to Sydney in 1902, to practise as company-
secretary and accountant. Since then he has
chalked-up a remarkable record of appoint-
ments and positions. He was secretary and
manager of the Distributors Commercial Com-
pany, Ltd., 1916-34; first Australian Trade
Commissioner appointed to N.Z., 1934-37;
chairman of the N.S.W. Milk Board, 1937-42;
business-member of the Navy Board, 1943-44;

money (even other people’s), admitted
that his novel Cattleman, which won
the Brisbane “Courier-Mail’s” Queens-
land centenary competition, has brought
him in quite a bit besides the £1000
prizemoney. It is being serialised in
Queensland and South Australia ; there
has been a 1 film-offer and an offer for
radio-serial rights ; and, after five pub-
lishers had cabled for it, one offering
£100 for first-option, Harrap's of Lon-
don are to publish it —with a handsome
advance and with a royalty-rate con-
siderably higher than what most Aus-
tralian authors are accustomed to.


Administration, 1943-46 (and full-member of
same, 1946); business-member of the Air Board,
1944-48; member of the Commonwealth Dis-
posals Commission, 1946 —and he still found
time for other interests, among them the
Methodist Book Depot (Sydney), for the success
of which he was largely responsible. Not
only Newington but the Methodist Church
generally owes him a deep debt of gratitude.

Lately honored by the University of
W.A wish the honorary degree of Doctor
of Letters, Dr. H. C. Coombs is governor
and chairman of the board of the Reserve
Bank of Australia (formerly known as
the Commonwealth Bank of Australia,
but now reconstituted). Dr. Coombs
had been governor of “the Common-
wealth” since 1949, but first joined the
board in 1942, and before that had
served on the staff of the bank.
Born at Kalamunda (W.A.) in 1906
and educated at Perth Modern School,
at the University of W.A. (where he won
the Hackett Scholarship), and at the
London School of Economics, he gained
a Doctorate of Philosophy in 1934 and
next year joined the Commonwealth
Bank as assistant economist. He was
appointed Economist to the Common-
wealth Treasury in 1939, became
Director of Rationing in 1942 and was
Director-General of Post-war Recon-
struction from 1943 to 1948, with J. J.
Dedman as his Minister.
He has represented Australia at many
overseas trade - conferences and was
directly associated with the establish-
ment of the Australian Bankers’ Admin-
istrative Staff College and S.E.A.N.Z.A.
—the South-east Asia, New Zealand and
Australia Central Banking Course—in
1957.
Apart from that, Dr. Coombs is the
pro-chancellor of the Australian Univer-
sity and one of the prime movers in the
establishment of the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust. He's been chairman of the Trust
since it was started, and takes an active
part in all its work. Interested in every

form of art and most kinds of sport, his
present sporting recreations are golf and
squash, which he plays as often as his
duties allow.

at Aberdare in 1941, and four years later
went underground as a surveyor’s assis-
tant. He studied at the Tech, and be-
came under-manager at Aberdare North,
where further studies brought him his
manager’s ticket. Later he went back to
Aberdare as manager. Similar posts at
Tyldesley and Aberdare Central followed

The Prince Henry, one of the most
beautifully situated hospitals in Sydney,
looks like getting a new lease of life as
the teaching hospital for the University
of New South Wales. A good deal of
work and reorganisation will be neces-
sary, however, to make the hospital
ready for its first intake of students in
1964, and much of it will fall on Harold
Herbert Dickinson, the newly appointed
Chief Executive Officer.
He’s well qualified for the job. He
kicked-off with the Lands Department
before War II and, as Clerk of Petty
Sessions and Crown Land Agent, was
running his own office at Eden at the
age of 20. The war took him to Singa-
pore and into the bag, and he was in
the first group of p.-0.-w. to leave
Singapore (under Brigadier Varley) for
Thanbyuzayat and the Burma railway
—Varley thought so highly of Dickin-
son’s abilities that he put him in charge
of camp administration when the Aus-
tralians managed to persuade the Japs
to hand that function over to them.
Home again, Dickinson spent eight or
nine months in Concord Military Hos-
pital and while there began studying
HOSPITALS
law at Sydney Uni. Out of hospital, he
joined the N.S.W. Public Service Board,
where his ability to reorganise and
improve—everything that came his way,
plus his topping the first-class honors-list
in Law, caused Wallace Wurth to appoint
him secretary of the board in 1949 at
the age of 32. He was selected for the
Prince Henry job by an independent
panel from among more than 50
applicants.

ABORIGINALITIES
“t’m worried,” admitted the doctor.
“Sister, would you try to find
out why the patients are not eating
their meals? They’re losing weight.”
“Don’t you like fish?” was Sister’s first
question to one of the many colored men
in the t.b. “Yes, Sister!” “Then,
why don’t you eat it?” The man was
silent, so she passed on to the next, who
had left his meat and rice. “Don’t you
like meat and rice?” “Yes, Sister!”
“Then, why don’t you eat it?” No
answer. So Sister decided: “I’m going
to leave you for a while to talk this out
between yourselves.” When she returned
they had elected a spokesman: “Sister,
we do not like to complain because you
all- try to help us, and it seems ungrate-
ful. Since you have asked, we do not
eat our food because it is too fresh.”
“Well!” ejaculated Sister. “Now I’ve
heard everything! Do you mean to say
you’ll eat the food if it is stale?” “No,
Sister ; we do not like stale food, but
this is too fresh.” “Is there a time when
food is just bad enough to eat?” He
smiled at her ignorance; white people
“In Sydney We'd be getting unemployment benefit !”
were so stupid: “Sister, we do not drink
sea-water ; it is salt. But we drink rain-
water because we like it fresh. Yet we
like salt in our food—but the cook does
not put any in.” Sister went to see the
cook, who was emphatic: Last year they
had admitted a patient who was on a salt-
free diet, and doctor had explained that
salt would make her very ill and could
kill her. If salt was so bad, she—the cook
—certainly was not going to give it to
any of the patients. She had stopped
eating it herself. Since then her legs and
arms ached and she had not been so well
—but how much worse she would have
been had she continued to eat salt! “Give
each patient some salt in a shaker, and
see that it is in the food you cook,”
Sister directed. The cook left shaking
her head. White people certainly were
hard to understand! Churinga.’
“Perseverando” (England): On the
liner, chatting with an old pioneer
farmer from Pantapin (W.A.), I
wondered how long the ship was. He
told me, “About ten chains ; I stepped
it along, the wharf before we sailed.”
Later I noticed on Sunday’s menu that,
as well as being a hunter in Greek
mythology, the Orion was 665 ft. 2in.
long—he was sft. 2in. out.

“Peanut”: Two city promoters were
discussing with our town’s publicity-man
the visit of a world-famous violinist to
our mining community. “The trouble
is,” said one, “we’ve got to find a way
of getting miners interested in the
musician, even if we can’t get them in-
terested in the music.” Our man asked
what sort of violin the musician would
play. “A Stradivarius,” was the reply.
“O.K. I’ve got it,” said our man. “World
Famous Musician to Play £12,000
Violin.” It’ll pack ’em in. That’s better
than Presley’s Cadillacs.” It packed
them in.
“Tony”: In a Queensland country
town every Saturday night I take my
usual position at the tail - end of the
picture-theatre queue. Half the populace
and a good percentage of its icecream-
eaters are in attendance and after 20min.
of splashing amongst the ices and
jostling with the owners I am issued with
a ticket and ushered to my seat and then
entertained for three hours with all the
fineness Cinema Scope can offer. It is
harder to eject one’s self from this place
than it is to enter, and at the end of
the show I am soon engaged in the
surging battle to reach an exit. Twenty
minutes later I am home a-bed and
exhausted. When do we get TV?

“O’Aitch”: During the depression-
years Bill fluked a job as cook’s assistant
in the auxiliary-ketch Leepootah out of
Hobart. She was wallowing off Schouten
Island on the Speck’s east coast with
Melbourne many hours away and reports
of gales in the Strait. Bill managed his
first wash-up afloat; a few moments
after he swung the greasy washing-up
water into the wind and wiped some of
the backlash from his eyes he realised
the ghastly truth: he had thrown over-
board every piece of the ketch’s cutlery
from the bottom of the bucket. Sum-
moning his courage he lurched aft and
broke the news to the captain. The
old man’s eyes were fixed on the horizon.
He didn’t answer. A long pause, then
Bill demanded: “Well, what about it?”
Old Tom’s weathered face grimaced, but
his reply was quiet and firm: “I’ve been
at sea for nigh-on fifty years, son, so
I’m not surprised at anything a bloody
landlubber does.”

“Murray Swagman”: Knew another
k young bloke who took an abo. for a
fright - ride. With floodwaters rising, a
working-bee was building a levee-bank
at the lower end of the town, alongside
the cemetery. Snowy, an abo., was
working along the cemetery fence when
one of the lads hid in the long grass
alongside a very old vault, and tapped
on the granite with a tobacco-tin. Snowy
leaned over the fence to have a look,
and a voice came from the grass, “Could
you lift the lid and drain this vault,
Snowy? I’ve been in here fifty years
and I’ve never been flooded-out before.”
They still claim in the district that it
was Snow who really was the first to
break the four-minute mile.

Something was destroying the ripening
grapes in my Queensland garden,
transforming a glossy blue-black bundle
of lusciousness into a bunch of dried-out
skins. Plenty of fig-birds, bower-birds,
an odd fruit-bat about. Dope that I am,
it took me a long time to find the real
culprit. But there he was one morning,
a tiny red-breasted robin, innocent and
appealing—perhaps. I watched his tech-
nique, close-up: he hung down on a
stalk and opened his beak full-width on
a single fruit. As he closed it the tips
slipped and skidded, then took hold and
left sharp scratches across the ripe skin.
He v kept at it hard work for a little
bloke. Now and again he’d hop up and
peep at me around the foliage, his coal-
black eyes seeming slyly to claim me as
his accomplice. And then at last the
sharp beak-tips broke through the tough
skin, and, burying his face in the sweet
stickiness, he tipped the pulp down his

“Ex-Quiz-King”: The native N.Z. frog
has virtually disappeared from the main-
land —due largely to bush-clearance and
swamp-drainage—and he is now mostly
confined to two outlying islands. But
three varieties of introduced Australian
frogs flourish. By some mysterious
“Are you the gentleman who ordered a pick-me-up?”
working of Nature many of these show
variations by having either three front
legs and one at the back or three front
and two back.

“Vic.”: The little community of Mia
Mia, near Kyneton in the Vic. midlands,
isn’t overlooking its link with Australian
aviation. A bluestone monument is to
be erected near the township to John
Robertson Duigan, who on July 16, 1910,
made the first Australian flight in an
Australian - made plane. Duigan, who
died in 1951, flew only a few hundred
yards in his rickety biplane, but set the
pattern of fhture Australian aviation
history.

“Sack”: In the spare wheel on top
of a box-trailer was the last place I’d
have chosen to ensure a safe passage for
a paperbagful of eggs, but that was
where the driver of the car put them.
I wasn’t optimistic about eggs for tea
as we bounced along over the rough
bush-road. An unexpected bad bend in
the road coinciding with an unexpected
car speeding towards us, and things hap-
pened in a hurry. When my heart had
squeezed its way back past my tonsils
again I took stock. The trailer on its
back with its wheels still spinning seemed
to be the extent of the damage. We
righted it, began reloading—and found
the googs without a crack! Eggs for
tea? No ; we remembered after we got
home—still sitting-up where we’d put ’em
on the roadside while we reloaded the
trailer.

“Villefair”: No need to stain the
chopping - block to eliminate slumber-
disturbing crowings (B. 20/4/’60); the
solution is simple—and bloodless. A
board hung at about 15in. above the
perch will render any rooster as silent
as the celebrated Dean. Watch a rooster
crow and you’ll see the explanation. A
crow is a challenge, and to issue it the
challenger raises his head and stretches
himself to the full extent of his self-
importance. An unexpected bump on
the noggin gives him both claustrophobia
and enough inferiority-complex to under-
mine any ideas about being chook
enough to wallop any featherweight
champ, within earshot.

“Tabba”: Parts of Europe have other
customs associated with houses under
construction (B. 4/5/ ’6O). In Lithuania,
when the roof is on the house the owner
puts on a keg for the workmen. If he
doesn’t, the gremlins move in, and when
the place is finished he suffers countless
petty annoyances.

“Mat”: Some years ago at Murrurundi
(N.S.W.) Police Court an aboriginal was
charged with the theft of fowls from a
train at a railway-siding. He pleaded
not guilty. The prosecuting-sergeant said
the accused was seen to take the fowls,
and asked the magistrate for a jail-
sentence, as the birds were valuable,
“having come from a good strain.”
Accused got a word in: “Sergeant not

“Arthur R.”: Frogmen are recovering
only minor relics from the wreck of the
Lock Ard, near Peterborough (Vic.); yet
the vessel, due in Port Phillip for the
Melbourne International Exposition of
1880, was carrying thousands of pounds
worth of art lent to the Exposition. The
salvage-rights of the wreck were bought
by a Mr. Miller, who was able to recover
most of the cargo and store it on the
beach. Then terrific seas swept every-
thing back into the sea. A fuil-size pea-
cock, made by a famous English pottery
firm and still in its crate, floated in later
and was the only thing to be salvaged.

“Two blacks,” great was my embarrass-
ment on seeing that my clients were two

“Thank you, Missus,” and joined in the

“Glenmore”: Those old-time rabbit-
traps (B. 20/4/’6O) became part of the
language where we used them in the

out” it could only mean that the rabbits
were getting out of hand.

“Mullbong”: Re Rock Davis, whose
links with early N.S.W. were recently
touched -on by an Aboite. Actually,
Rock Jones Davis was born at sea, in
June, 1833 ; he received his first
Christian-name from his maternal grand-
mother (who was a Miss Rock) and the
second (which he never used) from the
captain of the ship on which his'parents
and eight of his brothers and sisters
travelled from Ireland to Sydney. After
a while at Wollongong, William Davis,
the father, settled in 1839 at Kincumber,
built a small school of pitsawn-timber
roofed with shingles, and there taught
school, and preached for some years.
The historic stone church referred to
was not started until after 1840, and was
not completed until 1849. It was built
by free labor (as was the Holy Cross
Church at Kincumber South), and not
by convicts. As both his elder brothers
George and Thomas, as well as Rock,
settled there it would be reasonable to
assume that the locality received its
name of Davistown from the family
rather than from the individual,
especially as the “S.M. Herald” of
June 24, 1868, stated that “the prin-
cipal shipyard of Brisbane Water was
that of Thomas Davis, who had launched
from 25 to 35 vessels ranging from 10
tons to 225 tons and employed about
a dozen men and boys.”

MINING AND EXPORTS
[From an address by <J. R. FISHER, chairman, Mount Isa Mines,
Ltd., to the National Export Convention]
During 1959 Australian
primary mineral exports
amounted to £69 million, about
10 p.c. of total exports. Aus-
tralia is the world’s leading
producer of lead, and lead
was the principal mineral
export income-earner; other
important exports of metals
and minerals included gold,
copper, zinc, rutile, coal and
silver. Excluding gold, about
45 p.c. of the exports were to
Europe, 25 p.c. to the United
States and 15 p.c. to Japan.
During the same year, 1959,
primary mineral imports were
£9l million, of which £7l mil-
ion was represented by crude
oil. If refined mineral-oil
products are included, mineral-
oil imports were around £lOO
million.
It will therefore be readily
appreciated how important it
is to make Australia self-
sufficient in oil. It is to be
hoped that the assistance given
by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment to oil-exploration, and
the present activity in the
search for oil, will bring the
desired result.
If oil is discovered in Aus-
tralia in quantities sufficient
to meet Australia’s require-
ments, then, on the 1959 basis,
our balance-of-trade would
be increased by some £lOO
million.
Too much stress cannot be
placed on the importance of
the search for, and discovery
of, oil in Australia.
According to Mr. Jean
Vuillequez, vice-president of
the American Metal Climax,
the country which will have
the largest percentage-gain in
metal and mineral consump-
tion over the next 15 years
is Japan. This could be very
important to Australia.
Because of our location,
potential ore-reserves and
competitive cost of produc-
tion Australia is in a good
position to obtain a consider-
able share of the rapidly
expanding Japanese trade.
The Japanese market is, at
present, particularly important
to the Australian mining
industry because substantial
tonnages of lead, zinc and
copper are being exported to
that country.
At present there is a large
export demand for iron-ore,
and there are ample supplies
in Australia. This makes the
present policy of the Common-
wealth Government, prohibit-
ing export of iron-ore, appear
over-cautious.
It is suggested that if
limited exports of iron-
ore were permitted, say com-
mencing with a million tons
a year, our export earnings
would be increased, and the
search for more high-grade
ore would be encouraged, and
undoubtedly Australia’s known
resources would be increased.
To obtain the maximum gain
from iron-ore sales it might
be possible to couple the sale
of iron-ore with coal, and so
sell two minerals at the same
time. This idea should be
seriously examined.
Taking all factors into con-
sideration, and assuming that
export of iron-ore is allowed
and that Australia is not
barred by trade-barriers from
entering important overseas
markets, then provided prices
are approximately as at
present, it is not too much to
expect that, by 1975, Australian
metal and mineral annual
exports could be £2OO million,
which is approximately three
times the present total. The
exports could be greater than
this, depending on the scale
of exports of alumina. This
increased export-market, plus
increased consumption in Aus-
tralia, would require 150,000
tons of copper, 120,000 tons
of lead and 200,000 tons of
zinc more than Australia is
producing at present. Such
expanded production would
be equivalent to an additional
165 p.c. of the present annual
copper production, an addi-
tional 35 p.c. of present lead
production and an additional
80 p.c. of present zinc pro-
duction.
Development of the Industry
The entire ore production
for the expected increase in
demand by 1975 could not be
obtained from presently pro-
ducing copper-mines, and
probably not from existing
lead-zinc mines. However,
part of the anticipated demand
could be met by increasing
production at existing mines,
and by further development
of presently known reserves.
A most important benefit of
increasing output from existing
operations is the consequent
reduction in unit-costs. Low
costs will allow us to sell on
competitive world markets, and
the lower the cost of mining
the larger the tonnages of
lower-grade ore which can be
profitably mined.
Transport is a most import-
ant item in Australian mineral-
production costs, as, indeed,
with all Australian primary
industries. This cost item
must receive constant atten-
tion. Mining is also very
much a pioneer industry, and
mining-companies, because of
their remoteness, are required
to incur substantial expenditure
on housing, water-supply,
power and other facilities —
expenditure which industries
in more - favored areas of
Australia do not have to meet.
Considerable gains can also
be made by improved .metal-
lurgical methods which give
greater recovery of metal from
existing ore. Substantial im-
provements have already been
made in mining methods,
treatment of ores, and smelt-
ing processes, leading to a
greater percentage recovery
of metal from mineral
deposits.
Long-term
TCrom the long-term point of
view there are three other
factors which should be con-
sidered in increasing output.
First, if new mines are to
be developed in remote

northern Australia, substan-
tial capital-investment will be
required. This large invest-
ment might have to come, at
least partially, from overseas
because of the limited amount
of capital available in Aus-
tralia. There should be no
objection to this, as any
capital - investment in the
mining industry leads to an
increase in overseas earnings.
Second, to attract new
capital the incidence of taxa-
tion in mining investment must
be reviewed. Mining differs
from all other types of invest-
ment in that it is operating
a wasting asset. At the cessa-
tion of mining operations
fixed assets are virtually worth-
less ; thus, during the life of
the mine, the investment must
be returned, after tax, to the
investor, together with a return
commensurate with the risk.
Therefore, the impact of taxa-
tion on mining investment
should be less severe than on
other industries, and if further
exploration and investment in
remote areas is to be encour-
aged the present basis should
be examined.
And, thirdly, a factor which
is retarding the expansion of
certain sections of the mining
industry is the extreme varia-
tions of price which occur on
the world market for copper,
lead, zinc and tin. These
variations affect the stability
of the industry, and they occur
as the metals are marketed on
a price related to the London
Metal Exchange, which changes
daily. Aluminium and steel
prices, on the other hand,
change infrequently, and this
is to their great advantage.
In looking at copper, lead,
zinc and tin, it is remarkable
that the industry has allowed
its products to be adversely
affected for so long. Undoubt-
edly some changes in the
world-market situation will be
made, and the industry will
eventually free itself from the
handicap of violently fluctuat-
ing prices.
Taking stock of our mineral
position, and assuming expan-
sion takes place in the develop-
ment of our known mineral
deposits, t h e n Australia
appears to have ample supplies
df bauxite, coal, rutile-zircon,
blue asbestos, iron-ore and
probably lead and zinc to
meet the anticipated 1975
demand. However, we do not
have sufficient reserves of oil,
copper, tin, phosphate rock
and perhaps lead and zinc, so
deposits of these minerals must
be found.
Developing New Reserves
A ustralia should have a sub-
stantial number of mineral
deposits which have not yet
been discovered. A large por-
tion of northern and western
Australia, or over half of the
Australian continent, is Pre-
cambrian in age, and rocks
of this group contain valuable
deposits in other parts of the
world. The tremendous Indian
and Brazilian iron-ores, the
Rhodesian copper-belt, and the
lead-ores of Sullivan and the
Sudbury nickel deposit—all
are in Precambrian rocks.
There is no reason why our
very large Precambrian area
should not also contain many
important deposits. As it is,
Broken Hill, Mount Isa and
Kalgoorlie—our three largest
mineral areas —all stand on
the periphery of the Pre-
cambrian shield; if these
deposits exist on the edge, one
may conjecture more lies
within. t
Here again taxation allow-
ances could play a part in
stimulating exploration. The
money required for explora-
tion is not easily raised today,
for prospecting is essentially
a gamble, and the returns on
other forms of investment are
infinitely more attractive.
Assistance could be given so
that calls paid to prospecting-
companies are fully deductible
for tax purposes.
But even more important,
to intensify the search for
such untapped resources in this
Precambrian area of Australia
which is virtually uninhabited,
undeveloped and inaccessible,
we have to provide more
access to the interior.
It is interesting that a num-
ber of mineral discoveries in
this area so far have been
made near the few existing
roads. Mount Isa (Q.) was
found because it was close to
the road from Duchess to
Camooweal; otherwise it
might not have been discovered
to this day. A similar situa-
tion applies in the case of
Mary Kathleen. With one
exception, the initial uranium
areas discovered in the North-
ern Territory have been
within 20 miles of the North-
South road. The importance
of access-roads in the pros-
pecting for minerals cannot be
overstressed.
The problem of mineral
discovery has been success-
fully overcome in Canada,
where finds have been made
mainly because of accessibility
provided by natural inland
waterways. Strong tax-induce-
ment and improved methods
of geophysical prospecting
have also helped. Today
mining is a major export-
earner for Canada, as in 1958
Canadian mineral exports were
35.5 p.c. of total exports, and
almost 12 times as great as
Australian mineral exports.
Canada and Australia are
similar in many respects. Both
have relatively small popula-
tions and large areas of Pre-
cambrian rock. There is no
doubt that valuable finds could
be made in Australia, too,
given improved access to the
probable mineral-bearing areas
and adequate financial incen-
tives.
Conclusion
Tt has been said that the
A world future market-expan-
sion will provide scope for

great increases in Australian
exports of metals and minerals
by 1975. To take advantage
of the potential export market
greater expansion of our
known mineral deposits and
the discovery of new mineral
deposits is necessary. Fifteen
years is a comparatively short
time to find and place new
mines in production, and a
positive plan of action is now
required.
The most likely region in
which new mineral deposits
will be found is the little-
known northern and western
Australia. A large proportion
of the favorable rock in this
area has some sand and duri-
crust cover, which, combined
with the remoteness and hard
natural conditions, will make
modern prospecting difficult.
To find new mines in this
vast potential mineral-bearing
region, sealed access-roads are
imperative. These roads need
not be built as speedways;
utility roads will be quite
sufficient. While it may be
difficult to prove that these
roads are justified for mining
only, there is no doubt that
if defence and pastoral
requirements are taken into
consideration, then their con-
struction is justified. This is
the only method to develop
this vast region.
It is suggested that the
soundest way to approach this
problem is the formation of
a permanent Northern Aus-
tralian Development Commis-
sion on which the mining and
pastoral industries would be
represented. The first assign-
ment of the commission should
be to immediately study and
report on the requirements,
and then the commission
should act as a construction
authority on somewhat similar
lines to the Snowy Mountains
Authority.
Overseas Investment
[From Canberra]
HPhere is no possibility of the
A Commonwealth Govern-
ment taking action to enforce
overseas companies investing
in Australia, or those already
established here, to make some
share-capital available to Aus-
tralian investors.
Despite pleadings by the
Opposition that Australia is
being “put in hock” to Wall
Street and other financial
centres, the Government will
stand fast on its policy of
non-interference.
The Federal Ministry realises
that continued overseas invest-
ment, preferably at a higher
rate than the existmg average
of £ 150-million annually, is
vital to Australia’s continued
development.
Feeling from senior Mini-
sters right down through
Government - department per-
sonnel is that any attempt to
place conditipns on investment
will frighten it away post-
haste.
Government policy is that
when companies from overseas
make inquiries about investing
in Australia, the advantages of
allowing some Australian
equity are pointed out to them.
These advantages, in the
Government’s view, are that
Australian participation allows
the companies to gain a greater
knowledge of local conditions
while at the same time placates
political feeling against large
overseas corporations.
However, the advantages
are only put forward for the
companies themselves to con-
sider. Their final decision is
left to them entirely, and the
Government doesn’t interfere
in any way.
This policy will stand, at
least as long as the present
Government is in office.
It has the full backing of the
people who count —the P.M.,
the Treasurer, the Trade Mini-
ster and their respective depart-
mental heads.
They are the policy-shapers
and their mind is made up.

“Salome”
At a rehearsal for the
premiere of Richard Strauss’s
“Elektra,” there was a notable
scene. As Clytemnestra, the
celebrated Madame Clara
Schumann-Heinck was pitting
her stentorian contralto against
an orchestra going full-blast
and was making heavy weather
of it. The composer testily
stopped the orchestra and
shouted at the conducter:
“Louder! Louder! I can still
hear Frau Heinck's voice!”
That same preoccupation
with orchestral score at the
expense of vocal line—an in-
heritance from Wagner —is
also often in evidence in
“Mind you, I'll say THIS much for Dobell — he's put
that Menzies bloke on the map."
Strauss's opera based on the
Wilde piece about the part
played by Herodias’s evil
daughter in the slaying of John
the Baptist. In Saturday night’s
opening performance of the
Elizabethan Trust’s opera
season in Sydney this went very
close to uproar in parts of the
prolonged episode leading up
to the Evangelist implacably
resisting the temptations
launched by Salome, and later
when Herod and his step-
daughter are in strong vocal
contention in the matter of his
rash promise to her.
The orchestral score —with
the notable exception of the
music incidental to Salome’s
dance, which is quite graceful
—is uncompromisingly harsh,
as befits the grimness and
savagery of the plot. The
voice-writing is scarcely what
singers term “grateful,” for
absence of melody is combined
with the necessity to sing long
and difficult stretches against
an orchestra which can give
them little assistance in hold-
ing their “line.”
Despite all that, Strauss
wrought a music-drama of
power and unique skill which,
although some episodes are
padded beyond their worth, is
never less than gripping.
Ntefan Haag’s production,
with its simple, compact and
effective set allowing for easy
stage-traffic by separating the
royal pa r with their attend-
ants from the rest of the cast,
was excellent. Raymond
Boyce's rich costumes for
Herod, Herodias and Salome
contrasted sharply with the
stark rags covering the Evan-
gelist.
Joan Hammond, her dramatic
soprano working smoothly,
and suitably darkened in color
to underline her growing hatred
of John and her despair at
breaking his resistance to her,
gave an uncommonly good
account of the temptress, and
towards the end portrayed her
mounting necrophilia con-
vincingly. Her sinuous “Dance
of the Seven Veils’’ was a sur-
prisingly smooth as well as
solid projection of the lascivi-
ousness she aimed at 'the in-
fatuated Tetrarch. There were
times, however, when her
words failed to come across.
Neil Easton, a majestic,
dignified and lonely figure as
the doomed Evangelist, had to
lift his baritone to the zenith
of its powerful resonance to
make his defiance and his
declamation of faith ring above
the full orchestra. That he
could da this and keep his
diction clear was a tribute to
his musicianship.
Allan Ferris, whose previous
histrionic efforts have often
been marred by a reluctance to
let himself go, showed-up much
better as Herod, giving freer
rein to the emotions of a man
possessed in turns by infatua-
tion, fear and finally loathing ;
he was also in good voice, and
unexceptionable in enunciation.
Justine Rettick, vocally the
least burdened of the four prin-
cipals, was adequate, and duly
registered her evil joy at the
Evangelist’s fate and horror as
Herod ordered the guards to
crush her reptilian daughter
with their spiked shields.
The Sydney Symphony
Orchestra under Karl Rankl
negotiated the treacherous
shoals of the score* without
trouble either for themselves
or the singers.

Rossini’s Mass
The idea of a Solemn Mass
by the composer of “The
Barber of Seville” seems incon-
gruous at first, as apparently
it was to Rossini himself.
Whatever the reason, he
waited for 35 years after the
composition of his last opera
before attempting a Mass’. In
the meantime he no doubt
watched what Beethoven and
Berlioz did with religious
music, and some of their
influence may be detected as

a passing flavor in the work
that finally came forth.
Yet the Rossini Mass is not
the labored, selfconscious piece
of piety one might expect
after such long hesitation.
Perhaps it was Sir Malcolm
Sargent directing the Queens-
land Orchestra and the State
and Municipal Choir that
made the music sound so
spontaneous. Rarely has
this choir sounded so well-
balanced or so unanimous
about pitch and rhythm.
With everyone performing
with a loving care that never
became inhibited, the Mass
became more and more of a
delight as the evening pro-
ceeded.
Lois Marshall sang the big
soprano part with a larger,
warmer voice than records and
broadcasts had prepared us
for; she added radiance to
a fairly distinguished vocal
evening. The other soloists
were Joan Milford, Allan
Ferris and Stewart Harvey.
It was Sir Malcolm’s night,
though. His almost legendary
qualities as a choral conductor
were there to make the most
of a work he has adopted as
his own in the English-speaking
world. Hands were raised in
horror, of course, as they were
when Verdi wrote his
“Requiem” in the same music
of fire and passion he had
learned in his operas.
A Mass by Rossini must
inevitably sound like Rossini.
This one has the right spirit,
which is what matters. Good
audience-psychologist that he
was, Rossini provided some
blazing choruses that cry out
for applause, and as this per-
formance was an entertainment
the audience very properly
applauded. Besides, the night
was cold, and the exercise
welcome.
In Anatole France’s story,
the juggler who joined a
monastery was found standing
on his head before the altar,
juggling. This was the greatest
ability he had to offer. Rossini
praised his God in his own
wonderful style. His little note
on the score says: “Dear God
As thou knowest, I was
born for comic-opera. Little
skill but some heart, that about
sums it up.” Much heart and
great skill made this perform-
ance the memory of Sargent
that some of us will want to
carry a long time.

Yi-kwei Sze
The Chinese bass, doing his
second tour of Australia for
the A.B.C. after an absence of
seven years, selected for his
first Sydney concert a pro-
gramme which drew more
heavily on his interpretative
reserves than any he tackled
before. It was, in fact, a for-
midable challenge not only to
a singer’s intellect but to his
vocal equipment, for ft in-
cluded arias by Mozart, who
knew more than most other
composers just how far to
stretch the gamut both ways
and test a singer searchingly.
The big challenge was in
Schumann’s great “Dichter-
liebe” song-cycle. These 16
songs range in mood from
hope and serenity and rapture
to doubt and black despair and
finally bitter grief. The greatest
of them, “1 Chide Thee Not,”
a tremendous upswelling of
passion, was marred slightly by
the singer’s not rising to full
throttle on the high notes. This
reluctance to use head-note
power was, however, his only
defection from the very highest
standards. His deepest notes
are of glorious timbre, his
middle register is faultless, his
diction superb, his “forward”
production and breath-control
as good as any bass heard here
in 20 years.
His Mozart singing paid due
regard to its essential refine-
ments and its peculiarly subtle
evocations. “W ith i n These
Sacred Walls,” from “The
Magic Flute,” is the finest bass
cavatina in the whole range of
opera, and the singer accorded
it full sonorous weight, manag-
ing the extremely difficult
descent to the low-E as to the
manner born.
Switching to opera buffa,
he brought-off rollicking fun
in “If You Are After A Little
Amusement,” from “Figaro”;
explored all the mischievous-
ness of “When A Maiden
Takes Your Fancy” from “II
Seraglio”; and took the “Cata-
logue” aria from “Don Gio-
vanni” at a cracking pace, but
with enunciation unimpaired.
Three Moussourgsky songs
found him quite able to cope
with their unique difficulties
and the razor - sharp satire
underlying them. The best of
these was “The Seminarist,”
that piece of drollery about
the student-priest who finds
that love is hard to mix with
Latin substantives.
A brace of songs from Proko-
fieff’s “Lieutenant Kije” wound-
up a programme which had
begun with a majestically-
declaimed recitative - and-aria
from Handel's “Samson.”
Henry Penn, though ham-
pered by a cold, collaborated
at the piano with only a frac-
tion pared off his usual com'
petence.
“Image in the Clay”
As part of its commend-
able policy of risking a new
Australian play now and then,
Sydney’s Pocket Playhouse is
currently offering a look at the
third-prizewinner of the 1958
G.M.-H. competition.
Not surprisingly, it turns out
to be an even more mixed
bundle than that year’s winner,
“The Slaughter of St. Teresa’s
Day”; but whereas the win-
ning playwright lost his theme
in too many switches of mood
and pace, the present play-
wright, David Ireland, loses
his by overloading it with
conflicts and trying to do too
much with them.
Within the compass of five
shortish scenes before a
humpy on the outskirts of a
country town he presents us
with a half-caste aborigine, his
sluttish white wife, his white
father, his quarter-caste son
who has grown-up in the dis-
trict and his other son who
has been sent by the mother
to the city as a white hope,
an old full-blood who still
recalls the tribal law, and a
half-caste waif who is the good
thing of the town’s white
louts.
In establishing the complex
of relations between these
people there are four fights

more money flows back to M.L.C. policyholders
Higher earnings from investments,
reduced mortality and economy in
management have resulted in another
outstanding year for The M.L.C. This
is reflected in increased bonus rates for
all classes of participating policies,
ranging up to 5/- per £100 of assurance.
New business was again a record, with
policies for more than £86,000,000 sums
assured being written during the year.
The total sums assured and bonuses in
force now exceed £629,000,000. Claims
paid during 1959 amounted to
£9,300,000.
The mutual life and citizens’ assurance company limited
(incorporated in New South'Wales) MLC.IO3.H.P.
(one with knives), numerous
arguments, some offstage
shooting and much drinking
of “steam.” Yet in the end,
though the situation is deci-
sively broken-up, nothing
much seems to have really
happened under the surface.
The half-caste’s struggle to
square himself with the con-
flicting demands of his mixed
heritage and his family seems
to be the core of the play—
at any rate there is a conven-
tional attempt to symbolise
this poetically with an abo-
riginal legend and a clay
statue —but the other charac-
ters keep crowding in with
their own special conflicts,
dispersing the emphasis.
And there is the further dis-
traction —scarcely avoidable,
given the situation and the
improbable switchings of
focus —of frequent slips into
bathos.
All this is the more regret-
table since the author some-
times shows a decided talent
for building individual charac-
ters and conflicts.
Norman McVicker’s produc-
tion did much to give the
play a semblance of shape and
direction; and most of his
actors —notably David Dickin-
son, Hugh Richardson, Peter
Potok and Patricia Brownlee
•—succeeded in keeping well
this side of the confusion
inherent in the script.

“Suddenly, Last Summer”
Although references to it
are always oblique and fur-
tive, the inference emerges
clearly enough in this;
Tennessee Williams screen-
play that the pampered son
of a wealthy woman had,
before he met violent death
at the hands of some of his
victims, used his worshipping
mother as a procuress for
obtaining objects of his homo-
sexual habits, and that the
female cousin whom he took
abroad on his last venture was
used by him as a bait for the
same purpose, but without her
being at the time aware of it.
The nervous collapse the
cousin suffers as a result of
his death and what she finds
out leads to her incarceration
in a mental - home. The
mother’s determination to
make certain her niece will
never disclose what she knows
leads to her arranging for the
niece to undergo a brain-
operation ; but the surgeon,
not satisfied of its necessity,
begins probing for the truth
and brings the whole sordid
story to light. Tjje mother,
made aware for the first time
of the manner of her son’s
death (she had thought he
died of a heart-seizure), goes
off her own rocker—if, indeed,
she had ever been truly on it.
Katharine Hepburn never
quite succeeds in conveying
the impression that this
mother, who treated hereon
as if he were a god,
could have acted so vilely.
Elizabeth Taylor brings-off
some unexpectedly good
dramatic effects as the niece.

“Sink the Bismarck”
The historic sinking of Ger-
many’s boasted “unsinkable”
super - battleship by Britain’s
Home Fleet during the darkest
days of the last war is thrill-
ingly recaptured in this fine
British film, which has the ring
of authenticity about every-
thing in it, has the quality of
understatement so dear to the
British heart, and is admirably
acted by a solid cast headed by
Kenneth More as Director of
Operations at the Admiralty
during the fateful days.
The battle-scenes are vivid,
and Bismarck’s end a first-rate
piece of filmcraft. The film is
based on the book by C. S.

Aladdin and the other Arabians

“John Paul Jones”
Somebody tried to turn this
one about the first American

The result is a bore.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
City Mutual Life
/Confidently poised on the crest of
Australia’s continuing life-assurance
boom, the 81-year-old City Mutual Life
Assurance Society, Ltd., has had another
good year.
City Mutual’s status of a wholly
mutual concern allows its policyholders
to participate in the society’s growth
through steadily increasing bonuses.
Reversionary bonus-rates were again
raised (for the eighth time in nine years)
and the payouts amounted to £3,572,716
(up £661,860).
The society operates throughout the
Commonwealth, writing ordinary life-
policies. In addition, the wholly-owned
Perpetual General Insurance and
Guaranfee Co., Ltd., offers the usual
fire and general insurance services. The
support accorded by policyholders “has
been most gratifying and the increase
in premium-income has greatly exceeded
expectations.”
Recently, the City Mutual Life
Nominees Pty. was incorporated in
N.S.W., and also registered in Victoria,
Queensland and South Australia.
At December 31, 1959, the society had
a total of £186,453,443 assurances on
its books (up £22,544,849). This was
made up of £166,046,026 sums assured
plus £20,407,417 reversionary bonuses.
New business was a record for the
society, which last year issued 9216
policies, assuring £28,088,820 with annual
premiums of £702,963.
Income for the year ended December
31, 1959, amounted to £7,798,620 (plus
£21,095 profit from sale of assets) repre-
senting an increase of £761,345 over the
previous term:

£249,103), taking almost 28.4 p.c. of the
higher total income (28 p.c. in 1958 and
27.5 p.c. in 1959).
The society again succeeded in cutting-
down its expense-rate which was reduced
by 0.2 p.c. to 10.2 p.c. of the “total
normal income.” In view of the growing
scope and volume of business of the
society this is a very encouraging sigh:

Together with £27,258 brought down
from the preceding term, the total
amount available for appropriation was
£2,044,153. Of this sum, £2,010,423 were
appropriated to provide reversionary
bonuses to policyholders on a “sub-
stantially” increased scale. A further
£9649 was earmarked for interim
bonuses. Carry-forward to the current

The rate of interest earned, after taxes,
increased by ss. Bd. p.c. to £5 Bs. p.c.,
continuing to widen the margin between
the actual interest-rate earned and the
2j p.c. on net premiums, taken when
policy-liabilities are estimated.
The improvement in the interest-rate
is an important factor contributing to
the continuous improvement in the
society’s results and bonus-rates accruing
to policyholders.
There was little variation in the City
Mutual's investment-pattern. Advances
under mortgages accounted for 39.2 p.c.
of total investments, continuing to in-
crease at a slightly faster pace than
holdings of Government securities (32.2
p.c., compared with 33.3 p.c. in 1958).
The two items together with local-
government stock chalked-up £35,380,725,

ment portfolio of £47,686,037:

During the year under review, total
assets increased by £4,781,258, after pro-
viding £41,336 for depreciation. The
society’s life-fund stood at £44,553,413
(up £4,480,691) at December 31. Visible
reserves amounted to £1,474,081.
The steady increases in reversionary
bonus-rates, tax-concessions allowed on
life-policies, certain credit-facilities to
policyholders and other benefits make
assurance an attractive and easily avail-
able avenue of investment for millions
of ordinary men and women in all walks
of life. Herein lies the chief source of
strength and economic virtue of the life-
offices which have become such a basic
feature of modern business life.
Eric Anderson (Consolidated), Ltd.
A lmost 15 months ago Eric Anderson
(Consolidated), Ltd., Sydney-regis-
tered electrical retailer and h.-p. financier,
was converted into a public holding-co.,
acquiring all the issued capital in Mutual
Credits, Ltd., and Eric Anderson Radio-
Television Pty. Initial subscribed capital
after this merger of h.-p. finance and
electrical-retailing interests amounted to
£1,101,200.
Mutual Credits was formed as a
finance co. in 1932, had a paid capital
of £701,200 at the date of acquisition
and was paying divs. at the rate of I2j
p.c. p.a.
Eric Anderson commenced business as
a sole trader in Sydney in 1923, convert-
ing to a private co. (Eric Anderson
Radio-Television Pty.) in 1948. Eleven
stores were in operation in January,
1959, retailing radios, TV-receivers, re-
frigerators, washing machines, etc.
Since the formation of the public co.
satisfactory progress has been made.
Paid capital was increased to £1,338.855
following the issue of 948,580 ss. deferred
ords., l-for-5 at par, in November, 1959.
A further £75,160 of ss. ords. were issued
at a premium, in acquisition of property,
bringing paid capital to £1,414,015 as
at May 10, 1960. The co. is issuing a
further £IOO,OOO 7 p.c. “preferred ords.,”
underwritten by Mullens and Co., Sydney
stockbrokers.
By May, 1960, the co. was operating
25 branches in Sydney and suburbs, one
in Wollongong (N.S.W.) and two in Can-
berra. In Queensland, the retail outlets
of Packard Bell Pty., a prominent elec-
trical retailer, were taken over and
expanded to 5 branches in Brisbane, one
at Ipswich and one at Toowoomba.
The overall expansion policy resulted
in the group holding 35 retail outlets in
N.S.W., Canberra and Queensland.
The first set of accounts, released last
October (and really covering only three
months of operations of the holding-co.)
disclosed a net profit of £204,619 for

annual div.-rate forecast by the board
on formation of Eric Anderson (Con-
solidated), and following-on from
Mutual Credits’ 12| p.c. distribution.
On an annual basis the profit was
equivalent to an earning-rate of 18.4 p.c.
on paid capital. Reserves received
£171,227 and, with the pre-acquisition
kitty, totalled £156,334 after deducting
£487,984 excess of cost over par value

(preliminary expenses, etc.), amounted to

In connection with the recent issue of
£400,000 first-mortgage debentures the
co. disclosed its earnings to the end of
January. Consolidated net trading profit
of the group for the 7 months ended
January 31, 1960, amounted to £115,475,
after providing £67,301 for taxation.
H.-p. outstandings amounted to

was disclosed at £713,390. The co. had
£796,400 in notes, £452,166 in loans and

By the end of last January the co. had
revalued its assets-reserves, writing them
up by £69,483.
On May 11, 1960, subscriptions opened
for £400,000 first-mortgage, debentures,
with maturity-dates from 4 to 10 years.
Shorter terms are also available.
On the whole the firm has been doing
well.' However, in tying its original
business based on retailing of consumer-
goods to Mutual Credits, also depend-
ing on the buoyancy of consumer-sales,
Eric Anderson has become even more
vulnerable to variations in retail demand.
But in other directions there has been
some diversification.
At the last sale in Sydney the ss. ords.
fetched Bs. 1 Id. a unit with an immediate
yield of 7 p.c. on the basis of the fore-
cast p.c. annual div.-rate. The

Gibson and Howes, Ltd.
'T'he fortunes of Queensland-registered
sugar-grower and miller Gibson and
Howes, Ltd., are strongly influenced by
conditions in the world sugar industry.
In 1959 the international sugar price re-
mained below 3 U.S. cents a lb. (except
for one isolated peak of 3.17 c.), dipping
as low as 2.55 c. in July.
The industry’s main problem lies in
the fact that the rate of increase in the
output of beet- and cane-sugar continues
to outstrip the pace of growth of sugar-
consumption.
In the 1958-59 season, world consump-
tion of sugar reached a record 47,740,000
metric tons (up 3,115,000 m. tons or
6.98 p.c.), but accumulated stocks
climbed by a further 2,470,000 m. tons.
The industry operates under a system
of stringent domestic and international
production- and sales - controls and
quotas.
Australia is the fourth cane-sugar
producer in the world, and the yield per
acre is the second-highest, after Hawaii.
Most of the cane is grown in North
Queensland, where there is a strong con-
centration of canefields between Moss-
man and Ingham. A little cane is still
grown around Brisbane and in northern
river districts of N.S.W., where the in-
dustry originated.
Total Australian sugar-output for 1959
is estimated at 1,288,000 tons (94 n.t.),
a drop of 124,000 tons compared with
the previous year. The value to mills
of Australian sugar production is esti-
mated at about £59 million (£3l million
for home-consumption and £2B million
in respect of surplus and “excess” sugar),
which is approximately £5 million less
than for the 1958 season.
At the 1959 London discussions be-
tween the U.K. and Commonwealth.
sugar-exporting countries an extension
of the British Commonwealth Sugar
Agreement to the end of 1967 was
secured. The negotiated price for the
1960 calendar - year was fixed at
£stg.44 Bs. lOd. a ton, an increase of
13s. 2d. stg. a ton on the 1959 price.
Overall agreement quotas were con-
firmed at 2,375,000 tons (unchanged), but
provision was made for increases in
negotiated - price quotas when U.K.
domestic consumption exceeds a rate of
2,550,000 tons p.a. In terms of the agree-
ment a 3 p.c. increase is applicable to
1960.
Australia’s negotiated-price component
of the overall 1960 export-quota will be
316,500 tons. The overall quota will be
increased by 2000 tons because of a
“surrender” by East Africa. Parties to
the Commonwealth Agreement, including
Australia, were allocated an additional
75,000 tons under the International
Sugar Agreement quota. This helped to
bring Australia’s basic export-quota for
1960 to 650,708 tons (up 18,746 tons).
Australia’s total permitted exports for
the calendar-year 1959 under the Inter-
national and British Commonwealth
Agreements amounted to 640,343 tons
actual sugar (down about 11,000 tons).
The final price for “No. 1 pool” sugar
is estimated to be about £46 a ton
(94 n.t.), a decrease of 14s. sd. a ton:

The return to Australian growers was
£4 2s. 7d. per ton of cane crushed.
Domestic sugar production is regulated
by a system under which the return from
output within the local quotas (“mill-
peaks”) allotted to individual mills deter-
mines the “No. 1 pool” price. A much
smaller payment is made for “surplus”
sugar accepted in excess of the quota-
allocation.
In the preceding term 3083 tons of
“surplus” sugar were produced by
Gibson and Howes, and disposed of at
the low “third-quota” penalty-prices.
Last year, the world sugar-market was
further oversupplied and quotas had to
be stringently enforced. To assist
growers, it was agreed to accept an
additional one-half p.c. of the “mill-
peaks” from individual mills at reduced
“second-quota” price, but no further
“excess”-cane could be acquired.
The tonnage of cane required to fill
Gibson and Howes’ quota-allocation of
39,195 tons (including 195 “second-
quota” tons) was 279,425 tons:

With stand-over cane from the previous
season and a good growing start, the
tonnage in the 1960 season will again
be restricted to “mill-peaks,” in the co.’s
case 39,000 tons of 94 n.t. sugarr
Last season’s overall operations func-
tioned smoothly. Earnings are closely
tied with production and the complex
pricing-system. Last term showed little
variation from the preceding year. Net

Overdraft was higher, but

four years “large amounts have
been spent on tramway exten-
sions and rolling-stock addi-
tions and replacements.” The
co.’s tramways now deliver 81
p.c. of the mill cane-supply.
Capital-works being undertaken
prior to the 1960 season in-
clude the installation of a
pressure-feeder and a “major

(Q-).
Recently, the Commonwealth
Government increased the re-
tail price of refined sugar by
Id. a lb. On the whole the in-
dustry has a good record for
absorbing costs, which is just
as well for the domestic con-
sumers. Australian sugar is
cheaper abroad than in this
country —not an unusual twist
of international marketing
economics of primary produc-
tion.
Subject to the vagaries of
the world sugar-market, Gib-
son and Howes remains in a
strong position.
At the last sale in Brisbane
the 20s. ords. fetched 50s. 9d.

is 4.7 p.c. on the basis of the
steady 12 p.c. div.-rate.

The Invincible Colliery, Ltd.
New South Wales collieries
produced 4,879,000 tons
of coal in the four months to
April, 1960, compared with
4,535,000 tons in the first four
months of 1959. Production
has responded to growing
local demand plus substantial
orders from lapan.
But benefits have been con-
fined so far to the northern
and southern coalfields.
Demand for Western coal,
long in the doldrums, shows
no sign of improvement. The
Western coalfields are virtually
excluded from overseas
markets by high freight costs,
while Government policy
directed at dieselisation and
electrification of railways
impinges on traditional outlets.
Collieries about Lithgow
(N.S.W.) have been forced to
reduce output or place surplus
coal at grass.
In these circumstances, The
Invincible Colliery, Ltd., sur-
prises with a net profit of
£13,772 for the year ended

The old workings, first opened
in 1906, were closed two years

now been sold —the book-value
of freeholds and leaseholds at
balance-date was £122,356

in consequence substantially
reduced. “The increased profit
results in part from a lower
depreciation provision, £8064
(£14,855), which follows a
reduced employment of capital
in the new mine.” Taxation
provision was £6700 (£4700).
The diminution of reserves,
now £28,708 (£58,224), reflects
write-off of the residual book-

are substantially reduced
£15,457 (£26,611) following
finalisation of outstandings
associated with development
of the new mine. Cash at
£33,085 (£988) benefits the
receipt of proceeds of sale of
equipment on balance-date.
Invincible’s future is essen-
tially linked with that of the
western coalfields. Inevitably
changing times involving
switchover ‘from coal to alter-
native sources of power and
fuel plus remoteness from
effective markets place the
Western coalfields at a com-
parative disadvantage with the
near coastal collieries. Cost
economies per medium of
mechanisation have granted
Invincible a brief respite, but
inescapably the competitive
handicap attaching its geo-
graphical isolation takes toll
of earnings. And last term
profit was only just sufficient
to cover the 10 p.c. handout,
£10,400 —paid capital is held
in 104,000 20s. shares. All
things considered, investors
are not being over-pessimistic
in offering a mere 16s. 9d. for

ing a continued 10 p.c. div.,
is 11.9 p.c.

From Herbert Holman
The rise in the hire-purchase
debt for March by £3l
million (almost double that of
January and February)
endorses the Government’s
recent action in raising the
deposit on most goods to 20
per cent, and shortening the
term of ’repayment to two
years. This debt is increasing
on last year—a period of
exceptionally good business —
at the rate of four per cent,
and could become dangerous.
Both the Government and
the finance-houses expected
that the rush to buy consumer-
goods would leave the public
so tied with existing commit-
ments that there would be a
slackening-off this spring. The
reverse has occurred. Demand,
especially for motor-cars, is
stronger than ever.
Turning from spending to
saving, the fall in Stock
Exchange values has affected
the unit-trusts. Many small
savers, confident of capital
gains, have learned at first-
hand that prices can fall as
well as rise. One unit-trust
has had to dismiss staff which
it engaged to cope with
expansion ; all are slack. But
there has been no rush to cut
losses and it is understood
that none of the trusts has had
to sell large blocks of securi-
ties to pay withdrawals.
Jobs for the Girls
Business is slowly being
choked by inadequate staffing.
Employers are harassed and
desperate. Throughout the
London area the picture is the
same.
A girl, not long out of
typing-school, comes for an
interview and listens politely,
if a little impatiently, to the
details of the job, its pay and
its amenities. If she promises
well —and this is rare —the
employer prays that she will
be impressed ; if she doesn’t,
he consoles himself that any-
thing is better than nothing.
Before he can get down to a
definite answer she pipes: “I
have other places to go to.
I’ll phone you later.” She
goes to one of the other
places.
The result is that the lucky
girl, with perhaps six months’
business experience, chooses
the job which offers £t once
the highest pay, the shortest
hours and the easiest journey
to her home. But she doesn’t
stay. Personnel-managers, who
have analysed reasons for
leaving, can find no pattern,
and they know, from being
asked for references by the
next employer but one, that
the wastage is considerable.
The New Dramatists
That all our new dramatists
are under 30 is an indication
of how drastically fashions in
playwriting have changed.
In the days of Shaw, Barrie,
Galsworthy and Maugham
an author, having established
himself in letters, could reason-
ably hope for a continuance
of his successj Three plays
by the same dramatist appear-
ing concurrently was not,
perhaps, general, but it was
not unknown. And now the
Americans have coined a
word, “playwrotes,” for one-
play authors.
It would be untrue to say
that our new writers are
incapable or unwilling to learn
their craft. The essential
difference is one of approach.
Many of the earlier drama-
tists were more remote from
the intimacies of the theatre
and able to take a detached,
literary point of view. It is
significant that our new writers
are actors or back-stage
students or otherwise closely-
associated with a producer.
This professionalism has led
to some odd effects, of which
the “kitchen-sink” drama is
the most notorious and, prob-
ably, the quickest to be for-
gotten; but one young man of
exceptional talent promises to
emerge with distinction, even
with fame, from little-theatre
esoterics.
He is 29-year-old Harold
Pinter,' yet another East End
Jew to win distinction as a
dramatic author. In less than
three years he has become
well known in some half-
dozen plays and revue-
sketches, for his earthy dia-
logue and obscurity.
Pinterland
Pinter’s latest play, “The
Caretaker” (Arts Theatre
Club) has been applauded as
a little masterpiece and will
certainly become more widely-
known. Pinter’s method is
part-naturalistic and part-
impressionistic, but in “The
Caretaker,” his first three-
acter, he has introduced the
thread of a plot.
There are only three
characters: two brothers who
live in a ramshackle house
near Shepherd’s Bush, and a
tramp to whom one of them
offers shelter. The tramp is
a human derelict, battered by
life and showing a warped
spirit which causes him to bite
the hands that feed him ; he
shies from the offer to be
caretaker and is ultimately
thrown out.
The younger brother has
grandiose dreams and a pre-
dilection towards violence,
while the elder brother has not
long been released from a men-
tal home. Despite the squalor,
the crude language and the
lack of incident, there is
comedy, tenderness, compas-
sion, a wealth of human
experience and a cumulative
power which is quite entranc-
ing. Pinter’s technique is
natural (there is one eight-
minute monologue) and trick-
f r e e. He sketches his
characters very lightly and
doesn’t use his dialogue to
explain their backgrounds, yet
they come out as real people.
He depends substantially
upon his producer, Donald
McWhinnie, and the actors.
Donald Pleasence’s brilliantly
conceived and sustained tramp
is astounding for realism and
pathos. Alan Bates’s Mick is
all the stronger for being un-
stagey. But it is Peter Wood-
thorpe’s Aston, apparently
denying his mental unrest by
a laconic quietude, who haunts
the memory.
A most impressive and
unforgettable evening which
really touches the heart.


opened incredulous eyes at all
we thought we needed for a
camp.
Their own gear consisted of
a roll of mats and a large
woven basket of yam. But,
talking it over, they had long
since come to the conclusion
that the papalangi (white men)
were mad—quite mad, but so
clever that they must have a
devolo in them.
They were good churchmen,
of course! Lolo had been con-
verted by the Marist priests ;
Tui was a Mormon when he
was not a Methodist; yet when
Tui went home after the first
weekend Lolo could no longer
sleep alone in their modest
camp beyond ours. Dawn
found him curled-up inside our
hut, for, sure enough, in the
middle of the night a devolo
had taken a peek at Lolo!
Meanwhile they collected a
few coconuts for drinking, and
went off to the reef in quest
of fish for the next meal. Half-
an-hour later Lolo was back
with his joyous announcement,
“Kce ika !”
The ika was a small rock-
cod, a mere 40-pounder that
he had found “very asleep” in
a shallow reef-pool and had
“caught” with his long knife.
“What will Lolo do for a
bobao down here?” my wife
wondered.
“Get over to FaleVai village
and borrow one, I suppose.
Tongans are all the one family
when it comes to property.”
Lolo came back in due
course with the little outrigger-
canoe. It was laden with
yams, taro, breadfruit, bananas,
papaw and oranges. He stepped
ashore, eyes bright with some
exciting news. Over at Fale-
Vai a great fishing-expedition
was being organised for the
following day. The villagers
had suddenly remembered that
the foul-ground of the lagoon
over at Mounu had not been
fished for some time and
should provide a good haul.
There were acres of shallow
water where the bottom was
covered by a dense tangle of
branching staghorn-coral that
gave excellent cover for all
kinds of reef-fishes. Line-
fishing or spearing or netting
in that underwater jungle was
hopeless, but Polynesian
fishermen are up to some won-
derful tricks.
A ll day the villagers at Fale-
Vai had been busy strip-
ping the bark from long
branches of beach-hibiscus.
Coconut - leaves had been
gathered and split along the
edges to give narrow bands of
fibre with the leaflets attached,
and from these materials great
lengths of rope had been
plaited, the close-set leaflets of
the palm-leaves, a foot to
eighteen-inches long, standing
out at right-angles to the heavy
lines.
Dozens of coconut - leaf
baskets had been plaited and
stacked, spears and knives
sharpened, and the gear, lash-
ings and riggings of canoes and
sailing-boats overhauled.
The villagers had two seine
nets about a hundred-yards
long, and several of the women
had been very busy attending
to floats, weights and a few
mesh-repairs that had been put
off “a bongi bongi” (till to-
morrow) for a month or more.
Eyes ashine, Lolo told us
that Tobias and his offsider
Sikaleti (Cigarette) would be
coming along in the popping
motor-boat Kerosene Can, and
would have room for our party
if we wished to go. Would we
not?
I wondered if old Tobias
would bring the whisky-bottle?
—if he could find it. He had to
keep it buried in the beach
sand, in a spot known only
to himself, because, as they
said, “the old woman he get
it, and when he drink it he go
oop to the village and make
hell.”
Early next morning when the
flotilla set out, with two big
cutters under sail, Tobias with
the bleached blue eyes towed a
long string of row-boats, all
of them well overloaded with
laughing, chattering, shouting
natives of all ages, and many
nets, ropes, baskets and spears.
“Tss very good to bring Kapa
A Kalasini,” said Lolo. “He
make good big noise to make
very afraid the fish.”
“What’s the big idea? To
round-up the blessed fish?”
That was entirely the big
idea. After paddling in com-
pany for about an hour and a
half we entered the lagoon by
a wide passage to the north-
ward.
The boats loaded with nets
swung in towards the beach,
while those that bore the ropes
started playing-out their quaint
festoons and joining them end
to end until they had described
on the surface of the lagoon a
great semicircular arc with the
concave side toward the shore.
The rope, about four-hundred
fathoms in length, was sup-
ported at each end by one of
the boats, and canoes were
scattered along its entire
length.
The two end boats, still keep-
ing an equal distance between
them, were rowed slowly to-
wards the beach, and the rope
as it moved forward rolled
over and over, thrashing the
water with its projecting fringe
of leaves.
The gaps between the ends
of the rope and the shore were
filled with canoes, the natives
splashing the water with their
paddles, or diving overboard
to whip the surface into spray
as they dashed hither and yon,
laughing, shouting and sky-
larking, while the little “Kapa
Kalasini” went popping round
from end to end, adding to the
general din and making the fish
“plenty afraid.”
Other canoes darted splash-
ing along the outside of the
rope, while dozens of swim-
mers, armed with sticks, spears,
short boards, any instrument of
percussion to be had, beat the
surface of the water, adding
further to the general pande-
monium.
When the two boats at the
horns of the crescent reached
the shore the rope was hauled
in by parties of natives on the
beach. There were wild yells
from the canoes as the
frightened fish appeared in the
rope-bound, diminishing en-
closure and darted from end to
end of the menacing barrier.
Big haku (long-tom) and
hapatu shot skimming over the
surface, only to find their
escape cut off by a huge wal-
lowing sea-serpent of rope and
leaves, backed by a yelling,
splashing horde of natives.
A small turtle went bull-
headed at the barrier, to be
pounced on and brought
struggling to the surface by a
man who had dived overboard
from one of the canoes. Amid
shrieks of delight willing
hands relieved him of his
catch and the fonu was dumped
upside-down into one of the
boats, where he scraped help-
lessly with his flippers and
snapped his beak-like jaws.
The dorsal-fin of a five-foot
shark appeared circling round
just inside the leafy screen. A
couple of well-aimed spears
flashed through the air, and he
struggled splashing through the
barrier, with a canoe in chase.
Quickly secured with a noose
round his tail, he was dragged,
still struggling, to the beach.
A s the boats neared the
sandy cay the foul-ground
was left behind, and as the line
drew in the boats with the nets
put out and, joining length to
length, surrounded the shorten-
ing rope, under or over which
the fish were escaping despite
the yelling, splashing hordes
of natives.
Spears flashed right and left
and the enclosure became a
seething cauldron of fish.
Any big fellow making a
frantic rush to escape was
promptly settled by the spear-
men. Blocks of coral on the
sandy bottom impeded the pro-
gress, but were soon removed
by the swimmers.
A large shoal of mullet
appeared, swimming near the
surface, and at once the\objec-
tive became to spear as many
as possible before they could
leap the net and escape. Most
of them cleared the barrier in
great thirty-foot leaps.
That was where dreamy-eyed
Tui, standing in a canoe, had
his joyous yell cut short by a
six-pounder straight in the
mouth, and over he went back-
wards, to the delighted cheers
of the crowd.
As he came to the surface,
spitting blood, there were de-
risive cries of “Well done!”
“Want to eat fish, eh?” “Where
Kanahe ?” “Did you swallow
him?”
Except for two loose teeth,
a stiff neck and a pain in the
dignity Tui was none the
worse.
attempt was made to tow
the nets right ashore.
When the water had shoaled to
a little less than a foot the
work of thinning the dense
mass went on. Basket after
basket was filled and carried

T HE long-familiar column of smoke that has announced the movement
’ of trains across the rural scene for over a century, is vanishing.
In keeping with its vast modernisation programme, geared only to
the availability of capital funds, the Department of Railways is replacing
steam by diesel, diesel-electric and electric traction.
Already one complete section the North Coast Line has been
given over almost completely to diesel-electric traction, first stage in
a long-range programme that will mean more efficient and more
economical rail transport for New South Wales.
As improved industrial, commercial and agricultural techniques have
stepped-up the productivity of the State, so is the Railways moving

A Great Man with a Shovel
By ROBERT KENNEDY
Sitting on the wooden seat
on the veranda of the
Noondah pub, Jock
Macpherson watched a
tiny willy-willy frisk itself out
of the street dust and spin down
the road towards him, to peter-
out at the foot of the steps in
a flutter of paper scraps.
“It reminds me of the time,”
he said, “when a willy-willy
carried Paddy Dalrymple’s hat
and hung it on the tail of the
windmill behind the Diorite
pub.”
.None of the heat-weary men
on the veranda said anything.
“Paddy climbed up to get
it,” Jock went on, “but he was
always a clumsy cow, he fell
off and hit the ground with the
grace and ease of a bag of
spuds. Even the old Missus,
who ran the pub and was
known to have a piece of
diorite for a heart, was upset
as we carried Paddy in. ‘l’ll
get the poor creature a brandy,’
she said.
“ ‘lf it’s all the same to you,
Missus,’ said Paddy, ‘l’d as
soon have a whisky.’
“So he missed the first free
drink offered in Diorite for 40
years. He never could keep
his mouth shut —and whenever
he opened it, he couldn’t speak
until he’d spat his foot out from
the time before.’’
One of the men went into
the bar and returned with a
tray of beer. He was the only
visible moving creature in
Noondah. Jock took his glass,
tasted it, and ran his tongue
meditatively along his lips.
“Well, go on,” said the man
who’d bought the beer. “You
might be able to make us forget
it’s a hundred and fourteen in
the bough-shed.”
Well (said Jock), this Paddy
Dalrymple was one of the
best-known men on the West
Australian goldfields in the
early days—mainly because he
did everything wrong.
He was an Irishman, as big
as a side of beef and somewhat
the same color. He had
muscles all over him that
looked like the Leopold Ranges,
and he could shift more dirt
with a number-six shovel than
any other two men in Kalgoor-
lie. He had a head of solid
bone, which was just as well,
because he had no brains inside
to stop it collapsing.
But that Paddy was a great
man with a shovel, my word he
was. About 1930, smack in
the middle of the depression,
he and I were out of Coolgar-
die, going down Norseman way.
We were prospecting about,
napping a few reefs here and
there, and one afternoon I was
specking along a bit of a creek
bed, when I picked up a small
nugget, not much more than
half-an-ounce, but lovely, pure
gold. Well, we got the dry-
blower to work, and we shook
half of Western Australia
through it, but not a color did
we raise. However, one
smoke-oh time I noticed the
cap of a reef sticking up about
two chains down the gully. I
napped a bit off and put it
through the dolly-pof—and up
in the dish comes a tail of gold
that fairly screams four ounces
to the ton.
Paddy and I reckon we’re in.
We sink down on that reef at
a speed that wouldn’t disgrace
these modern Snowy River
tunnellers, with visions of pay-
ing the storekeeper and retiring
to Perth with a roll big enough
to buy a pub, maybe.
Then, about twenty feet
down, with around ten tons of
ore on the surface, the reef cut-
out as though someone had
sliced it off with a knife. We
couldn’t believe it —but it was
right enough. Must have been
some shift in the formation
years ago that left our reef just
a pocket of stone sitting by
itself. I tell you, our spirits
were low that night. You
might even say our throats
were too tight and dry to talk.
A man got up and filled the
glasses.
Of course (Jock went on), we
went down a bit more, and
tried driving out a bit to see
if we could pick it up, but not
a sign. So we took our small
parcel in to the battery at Cool-
gardie and had it put through.
We got thirty-five ounces out
of the ten tons, which was a
help, but we weren’t in any
sound financial state when we
stood at the bar of the Denver
City that night after the clean-
up at the battery.
r T'HE storekeeper was happier
than he had been and we
had a couple of drums of petrol
and two new tyres on the back
of the utility, but we had only
a few quid for drinking-money
in our pockets when this bloke
comes up to us.
“Mr. Macpherson and Mr.
Dalrymple?” he says.
“Yes,” I says. “Have a
drink.”
“Thank you,” he says, “a
small beer. I represent an
English mining company which
is interested in acquiring proven
leases in this area and I heard
at the State battery today that
you have had quite a good
crushing.”
“That’s right,” said Paddy,
“but ...”
“But,” I says, stepping be-
tween Paddy and the English-
man, and elbowing the idiot
Irishman in the solar plexus,
“I don't know that we’d be
thinking of selling.”
Well, there it was: a ray of
sunshine; only a feeble ray, but
strengthened a bit by the dis-
covery that the Pommie was on
the business-end of his com-
pany, and knew nothing about
mining as such. To cut a long
story short, we arranged to
take the Pom out to the show
and I carted Paddy off and
gave him a lecture that even he
could understand: he wasn’t
allowed to say anything.
Next morning we drove out,
and I told Paddy to boil the
billy at the camp and give the
Pom a mug of tea while I raced
over to the shaft and scuffled
around in the mullock for a
few samples of the reef. There
weren’t many, because we’d
picked over the dump pretty
thoroughly to get every ounce
into our crushing, but I found
a few pieces which I threw
down the shaft.
Back at the camp we had our
tea, then we took the Pom over.
He looked at the hundred-odd
tons of mullock like the new-
chum he was while I gave him
a spiel about the ease of sink-
ing a shaft in such good coun-
try. Then we went down the
shaft and, with Paddy’s great

MISS STRAWBERRY
[Second Selection from a Series of Rhymes for Children]
By ERIC C. ROLLS
1 Her Shadow
Miss Strawberry has no
shadow
But a funny little man
Follows in her footsteps
Wherever he can.
He is much afraid of water
So he stays home in the rain
And when it is hot and sunny
He stays home again.
All through the winter
He says it’s much too cold
For any living shadow
Especially when he’s old.
Sometimes in the springtime
He says he does not mind
Acting as a shadow
And follows close behind,
So close behind Miss Strawberry
His pointed shoes and thin
Trip her up or kick her
Roughly on the shin.
Which makes Miss Strawberry angry.
She chases him away.
“I needed a shadow yesterday
But certainly not today.”
Tom Tomato
Tom Tomato plays
The piano all his days.
As each little note
Flies into the air
He takes it by the throat
And threatens it “Beware,
“Minim, crotchet, semiquaver,
Sharp or flat, or lively quaver,
Rest or demisemiquaver,
Semibreve or slow old breve
Or any other little shaver,
That you keep in order as you leave
And hasten in time and tune to
where
Miss Strawberry waits in her
big armchair
To hear the joyful songs I play
Sweetly for her night and day.”
The silly little notes
Feel their tender throats,
Then hop about and play
Up and down the scale.
Many lose' their places
In blindman’s buff and chases.
Many others fail
To find the shortest way
And fly around and wail
More than half the day.
Thus Miss Strawberry hears
A noise that frightens her ears.
She calls her yardman “Dan,
oh, Dan!
Do you hear this furious din,
All about, both out and in ?
Collect the lot at once, my man,
And dump it in the garbage-can.”
The Bouncing Rat
Once there was a bouncing rat,
Long and lean and very fat,
Lean and fat and fat and lean
Or somewhere halfway in between,
Who chased Miss Strawberry's daughter’s
cat
Round and round and round and that
So annoyed the barking cat
It humped and scrumped and clawed and
spat
Which so annoyed the bouncing rat
It bared its teeth and muttered “Scat,”
Which so annoyed the awful cat
It caught and ate the savage rat
Which so annoyed the bouncing rat
It gnawed upon the barking cat.
Then they both began to fight
All day long then all the night
With kick and scratch and claw and bite
Until their legs were so confused .
And bodies torn and so contused,
One could not see if which or what
Were barking cat or bouncing rat.
The Chimney
Miss Strawberry’s chimney
Stands aloof,
Looking down
On her spreading roof.
With hat on head
He stands and smokes
And coughs and spits
And seldom speaks
Until begin
The winter rains
When day long, night long,
He complains
Of rheumatism
In his bricks ;
Because he says
The old roof leaks
And wets his feet
And lower back
Which bends in pain
And stops his smoke.
Then he growls
That it’s no great joke
To be stuffed to the hat
With hot black smoke.
Then he coughs
And groans and then
Begins to say it
All again.
Soon the roof
Begins to carp
That he’s tired of holding
The chimney up.
He says “I’ve done it
Long enough.
I’ll wriggle my hips
And toss you off.”
Miss Strawberry calls
“Stop quarrelling, roof,
Or I’ll call the plumber \
To take you off.
“As for you,
You cranky chimb ley,
Stand up straight
And stand up dumbly.”
Miss Orange
Miss Strawberry and Miss Orange
Were walking out to tea.
“Miss Strawberrysaid Miss Orange,
“It is so good of thee
Thus to ask me walking
And to take me out to tea.”
She spread her little sunshade
And held it to the sun.
“Miss Strawberry,” said Miss Orange,
“I think I’d like a bun.”
“Miss Orange,” said Miss Strawberry,
“I would not like a bun.”
She too raised her parasol
And in her crimson gown
That rustled like the waving grass
Walked beautifully to town.
Miss Orange walked beside her
In her yellow yellow gown.
“Miss Strawberry,” said Miss Orange,
“I would like a cup of tea
And a little piece of shortcake.
My dear, would that please thee ?”
“I think shortcake’s nasty
And I do not care for tea.”
“Miss Strawberry,” said Miss Orange,
And she spoke so stiltedly,
“If buns and cakes offend thee,
What wilt thou have for tea ?”
“Miss Orange,” said Miss Strawberry,
“My dear, I shall eat thee.”


A Veteran Searches His Memory
The Rising Sun
By P. V. VERNON
Shortly after reading Bruce Hard-
ing’s article on the origins of the
Rising Sun badge (B. 11/11/ 59)
1 wrote to Frank Rose, an original
member of the Ist Commonwealth
Horse and now living at Sandy Bay,
Hobart, asking him for his recollections
of the matter. He replied:
This is my knowledge. I had just
returned from South Africa when the Ist
Commonwealth Horse was formed in
Sydney. I came to Sydney and was selected
as ' acting-sergeant "A’’ Squadron. My
regimental number was 24.
We were at Randwick and things were
all askew for a while. I had met Capt.
Cox-Taylor—Charlie as we called him
then behind his back. He came in about
the 20th of the month [January, 1902].
Seeing me, he told me to report to the
orderly-room. When I got there, he w'as
there with three or four others, Staff
men from the Barracks. “Oh, Rose,” he
said, “this is Mr. Harris; he is in charge
here. You get the attestation-papers in
order for the regiment.”
It was when Col. Lee came in as
Second-in-Command that we were work-
ing pretty well. He was a fine man and
would do all he could for anyone that
was a trier.
Now, . 1 can’t just remember the date
when Col. Lyster came from Queensland.
He came in one morning in a bit of a
flurry and called out, “Where are you, Mr.
Cox-Taylor? Here’s an awful over-
sight.” I turned round and said to Mr.
Harris, “The Adjutant is out looking
at some horses just brought in.”
He [Cox-Taylor] was sent for. As soon
as he got in Col. Lyster said to us,
including Capt. Zouch, of “A” Squadron,
“We have no regimental badge and we
are the .first Commonwealth forces to go
abroad. 1 have spoken to Commandant
Hutton at the Barracks and said we could
use the Australian coat-of-arms with a little
bit of fixing-up, but I was jumped on. We
are a young son of England and as such
should get something that will be the
badge for all time.”
Cox-Taylor said straight-out, “We want
a rising sun.”
1 remember that now quite well, and
after t some days saw Cox-Taylor coming
from' the Victoria Barracks, having
had a talk with Colonel Hutton. He
[Cox-Taylor] was passing a rubbish-tip
under the rock on his short-cut. He came
in and said to the crowd, “Hutton said
to get one quick or spoil the Australian
coat-of-arms.” Cox-Taylor said, “I’ve
got a start. I found this on a rubbish-
tip.” It was a blazing sun, an advertise-
ment for something. Col. Lyster said
later, “It looks like a Jap sign,” and
Cox-Taylor folded it up near half.
“Make those tongues of flame out of
swords and bayonets and put a crown in
the centre. Make a scroll for Common-
wealth Forces, and I think I can make
something out of that.”
Those are the cold facts, condensed, of
course. If this had been 1936, I could
have given a copy of the drawings, but
they and my diary were burned in Brisbane
when my sister's home was burned to
the ground.
1 was in the orderly-room more than
once as a temporary relief and quite a
lot of it comes back....l am only too
pleased to be of help, and you can use
my name in claiming that to Col. Cox-
Taylor, and to him alone, goes the credit
for the Rising Sun.
Mr. Rose is, of course, speaking from
memory of events which happened 58
years ago, so it would not be surprising
if there were some confusion in his mind
over details. Contemporary newspaper
reports establish that General Hutton
arrived in Sydney on February 5, 1902.
Bruce Harding has produced evidence
that Col. Hoad wrote from Melbourne
on February 6, enclosing designs for
Hutton’s final approval; and that Hutton
telegraphed to Hoad approving a design
on February 7. It is clear that Rose can-
not be right when he speaks of Col.
Lyster seeing Hutton af Paddington
Barracks and then raising the matter for
the first time with Cox-Taylor.
Col. Lyster arrived from Brisbane and
assumed command of Ist Commonwealth
Badge of 1st Commonwealth Horse, 1902.
Horse on January 29. [Press report.]
General Hutton arrived in Melbourne
from England the same day.
Tr is reasonable to assume that Lyster
would call at the Barracks on the
day of his arrival. Ist Commonwealth
Horse was camped at Moore Park,
quite close to the Barracks. Brig.-
General Finn, Commandant N.S.W.
Forces, was then in Melbourne (for the
purpose of meeting Gen. Hutton) so
Lyster would have had to report to some
other officer. Finn arrived back in
Sydney on January 31. [Press report.]
Lyster would naturally report to him
the same day.
Admittedly, this would not leave much
time for preparing and dispatching
designs to Melbourne—and it does
appear that Cox-Taylor must have pre-
pared some designs, whether they were
finally rejected or not —but one point
all the stories agree on is that there
wasn’t much time, anyway.
One small item in Rose's letter seems
to me to have the ring of complete
authenticity—the mention of Cox-Taylor
finding “a blazing sun” on the rubbish-
tip and using it as raw material for a
design. This is the sort of thing that
could happen to a man whose mind was
already attuned to the idea pictured in the
advertisement. It is not the sort of thing
that a man would invent after half-a-
century of history had hallowed the
emblem.
It may seem impossible to correlate
all the stories, but surely it should be
assumed to begin with that all the wit-
nesses are talking in good faith, and
that discrepancies are due to slips of
memory or lack of full knowledge of
the facts. And, after all, I suppose even
Peacock was speaking (in the 1920’5)
from memory. The only known facts
are the letter and telegram, the dates
quoted and the fact that the badges were
made by a firm of Melbourne die-makers
(name unknown).
A ll the versions start with the assump-
tion that no discussion of the badge
took place before January 29—the day
Hutton reached Melbourne and Lyster
reached Sydney. I submit that it is quite
possible that the matter had already
been discussed —possibly between Finn
and Hoad—and that Finn raised it with
Hutton in Melbourne on January 29 or
30. That would have given Hutton the
opportunity to reject the coat-of-arms
idea, “no flora or fauna, ’’ etc., and to
suggest “something like that” the
trophy of arms.
Meanwhile in Sydney, Lyster could be
calling at the Barracks, finding out from
whoever was in charge in Finn's absence
that no badge had been designed, hurry-
ing back to Moore Park camp and
setting Cox-Taylor to work on the job.
1 hen, on the 31st, on learning Hutton's
views from Finn, he tells Cox-Taylor
that the coat-of-arms is “out.” Cox-
Taylor picks up his piece of treasure-
trove on the rubbish-tip and completes
his final design. The several designs are
sent to Melbourne and Hutton sends
one or more to the die-maker for scale
drawings (possibly with alterations).
These scale drawings arrive at Army
Headquarters after Hutton’s departure
to Sydney and are posted up to him by
Hoad. He approves two designs by
telegram.
nPHE official version of the origin of
the badge—the Treloar-Peacock ver-
sion—relates entirely to what happened
at Army H.Q. in Melbourne. The stories
of Lee and Rose similarly refer only to
incidents they claim to have witnessed
at Moore Park camp, Sydney. The two
versions are not irreconcilable. I feel
that neither contains the whole truth,
but that each holds some of the neces-
sary ingredients for arriving at the real
story.
I submit that the reconstruction I have
suggested above is a feasible one which
fits the known facts.


SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
At Moonee Valley
Saturday was a day of odd
happenings at the Valley right
from the word go. Rounding
the home-turn in the Laluma
Handicap second-favorite Mer-
abilly crossed sharply in front
of the favorite, King Dassie,
causing that gelding to be
checked severely. They were
lengths clear of the field, and
Merabilly went on to be clearly
first past the post from Cruiser,
who had passed King Dassie
(third) while he was still re-
covering from his set-back.
When MacGregor, rider of
King Dassie, protested against
Merabilly the repeated query
was: “Where does Cruiser fit
into the picture?” Contrary to
popular belief, any horse can
protest against any other run-
ner that causes him interfer-
ence, irrespective of their finish-
ing positions. If such a protest
is upheld, the effect is to
relegate the offender behind the
sufferer, but no other runner is
affected. Consequently, th e
stewards, having found that
Merabilly had ruined King
Das s i e’s winning - chance,
amended the placings to read:
Cruiser, 1; King Dassie, 2;
Merabilly, 3. By the rules, the
stewards could have reached no
other decision.
There was another unusual
occurrence in the 13-furlongs
Jacana Handicap for three-
year-olds. At barrier-rise the
Hydrogen gelding Amun Re
threw his rider. Thereafter
Amun Re ran his own race,
in such a manner as to suggest
that he is an unusually
intelligent horse and pos-
sessed of great will-to-win.
For the whole of the
long journey he raced with
the field without causing any
interference to the other run-
ners. Indeed, he seemed at
pains to pick the best passage
through the field. At the five-
furlongs he went t£> the front
and, handling the tricky turns
adroitly, maintained his advan-
tage into the straight. When
the others closed on him in the
run home he put his head down
and obviously drew on his
reserves of strength to keep his
lead. He actually passed the
post first, and his satisfaction
at so doing was plain for all
to see. Such a horse is worth
remembering!
Winner of the Jacana, Car-
bonella —a filly by Carbon
Copy from Bathing Belle (imp.)
by Hastings from Canon Belle
—has now won three races on
holding tracks. In the spring
she was outclassed by the best
fillies, but she comes from
sturdy stock, and she’s bound
to improve with age.
When a man's racing-luck
is in the most extraordinary
things can occur in his favor.
Alex Fullarton won his sixth
successive steeplechase when
Tinto took the Commonwealh
“Ah tell you, suh, ah HAVE got two black eyes!”
Steeple, but the aged Solar
Bear gelding won more on the
mistakes of others than on his
own ability. Half the dozen
runners toppled over, some
of them through the sheer
bad luck of becoming
entangled with fallen horses.
Tinto missed the interference,
and ran home an easy winner.
The race should have gone
to Carey Dale, who was well
clear of Tinto when he was
brought down by. the fallen
Prince Orata at the five-
furlongs. Carey Dale was only
“trotting” at the time. How-
ever, Tinto stays very well,
and is a definite National hope.
In second place, the greybeard
Van Perri —-he’s eleven!
has now started six times in
the Commonwealth Steeple
for three wins, two seconds
and a third.
• • • •
“Horses for courses” applies
more to the Valley than to
any other Melbourne track,
as Star de Feu showed in the
Federal Hurdle. He won a
Hurdle there three weeks ago
by 12 lengths. Subsequently
easily beaten at Warrnambool
by Locharn, Star de Feu on
Saturday beat Locharn by 20
lengths.
Another with the same
liking, the four-year-old mare
Teruko, by Jambo from White
Flag, has had three of her
four wins on heavy tracks at
the Valley. Prior to leading
practically throughout to win
the first heat of the mile Deep
Creek Handicap with some-
thing in hand, she hadn’t
scored since 1958.
It’s not unusual for the
least-fancied of a stable pair
to win the money. One of
the three 100-to-l Melbourne
Cup winners, The Pearl,
started at that price in 1871
because his owner, John Tait,
was convinced his stablemate,
Pyrrhus, would win. Some-
thing similar happened at the
Valley when Jamec won the
second Laluma. Jamec’s stable-
mate, Golden Acres, carried
the firm’s money at 3 to 1,
but Golden Acres was a poor
third behind Jamec. The
winner is by Jambo from Gay-
land by Agincourt (imp.) from
Garland. He had been beaten
in Maiden company at Gee-
long three days before when
heavily backed. Owner H.
Williams commented sadly on
Saturday that he didn’t have
a penny on Jamec in the
Laluma.
• • « . •
Sundial, at 50 to 1, got a
camera verdict in the second
Deep Creek Handicap. Hurd-
ling’s his game, but, racing
first-up from a spell, he gave
inexperienced apprentice Ray
Ameer his first winning ride.
Son O’ France may have earned
himself a trip to Brisbane for
the Stradbroke by his win in
the Kiata Handicap, but,
though he has scored some
striking victories against winter
company, he has shown noth-
ing to suggest a Stradbroke
chance.
* * *
Sydney Form
Grand Garry has won at
from five to 16 furlongs, and
those who like him for the
two-mile Brisbane Cup (Mon-
day, June 13) were delighted
with his brilliant burst from
the home-turn in the Rosebery
Handicap at Randwick last
Saturday, when he finished
fourth. Weighted at 9.4, he
carried 8.11 with apprentice
N. Hewitt’s allowance ; he has
9st. in the Cup. Grecian Vale
—favorably handicapped at
7.5, and well ridden by appren-
tice Peter Miers —landed the
Rosebery from Heroic Victory
and Mt. Royal (one to jot down
for an early win in easier com-
pany). Great Blaze had strong
backing, but struck interfer-
ence, while the most popular
pair, New Zealander Lion and
local Diamond Vista, shaped
poorly.
Grecian Vale wasn’t the only
Randwick winner that appeared
favorably weighted. In the
following event, the May
Handicap, Fire Flair, narrow
winner over Caybros, with
pacemaker Morning Gleam
third, was well in at 7.5 (21b.
above the limit) for a winner
at his three previous starts.
J. Thompson rode him at
7.6, and the pull in weights
was the decider in the close
finish. Caybros (8.1) scored
his first placing since being
taken-over by Jack O’Sullivan,
who’s getting a smart team
together. Three-year-old filly
Weeamera proved a disap-
pointing favorite, but, as she
had Bst., she was set a tough
task against Fire Flair, of the
same age and racing in fine
form. Weeamera hasn’t won
since late October, when she
was taken to Melbourne, but
the stable cbnceded her a
sound chance in the May
Handicap. She had finished
third at two prior starts and
looked fit enough.
Booroola, stylish winner of
the Mascot Maiden, had early
support at 16’s, in odd places
at 20’s, and firmed to 9’s. She
had been working nicely at
Randwick, had a provincial
placing at her prior start, and
country apprentice B. Leroy’s
allowance brought her weight
down 71b. to 7.10. Leroy rode
a capital race to beat outsiders

Payray and Hideaway, with
favorite Great Finale a wea-
kening fourth. A filly by Os-
borne (Fr.) from Good Wishes,
Booroola was offered at the
Randwick yearling-sales two
years ago, but when bidding
ceased at 250gns. her breeder,
A. C. McKay, of Forrest, Can-
berra, took her from the ring,
and she’s racing in his colors.
Her dam is by Le Grand Due
(Fr.) from Congratulations by •
Gay Lothario (imp.).
The Two-year-old Handicap
proved what it had looked —
a soft snap for hot favorite
Southport; in fact, Tom Hill
was sitting against the young-
ster in the closing stages. A
plunge on the runner-up—the
Victorian youngster Mendlson
—brought his price from 25’s
to three’s; he started second-
favorite and at least led most
of the way. As Cherry Dust
started from the extreme out-
side barrier-position, his third
seemed a fair effort. Yass,
though unplaced, also shaped
promisingly. Southport, who
has scored at three of his last
four starts, possesses the Port
Vista speed, and intentions are
to take him to Brisbane for the
Sires’ Produce Stakes.
Pride’s Castle, runaway
winner of the Encourage,
hasn’t done a lot of racing,
and should be all the better
for that. His first win at
Randwick in December was
in Novice company, and he
could be worth noting for
distance events in the spring.
A three-year-old New Zealand-
bred gelding, he should be
able to stay, being by Nearco’s
son Castle Donnington (imp.)
and from Golden Legend by
Gold Nib (imp.) from Great
Memory by Magnus (imp.).
Troy is a rising-seven
entire, but is still capable of
winning his share of races,
especially Welters. In the
most open betting of the day
he had solid support at 8 to 1
for the mile Eastlakes Handi-
cap, and Mulley brought him
from the middle of the field
in the early stages to secure
a rails run in the straight—
smart horsemanship. How-
ever, Exemption, burdened
with 9.13, was beaten by only
the narrowest of margins, and
seemed a bit unlucky. Sea
Hound was only a further nose
away third.
A youngster that more might
be heard of won a Two-year-
old Maiden at last week’s
Kembla Grange meeting—easy
winner Sta 11 en, trained at
Randwick by Terry Brosnan.
He’s by Gold Nib (imp.) from
Sun Song, a New Zealand-bred
mare by Mid-Day Sun (imp.)
from Highland Delight (imp.)
by Panorama.

Another N.Z. Champ .
Running true to his New
Zealand form, Sun Chief out-
classed his rivals in the final
of the N.S.W. Pacers’ Derby
at Harold Park last Friday
n'ght. Taking the lead after
the first couple of furlongs
from Great Cheer, Jack Watts
had Sun Chief hard held in
winning by \\ length from
Mylandry’s Pride (winner of
the recent Sires’ Produce
Stakes), with Great Cheer a
half-length further away. Sun
Chief’s time, 3min. Bsec., was
lj-sec. slower than his heat-
winning time, but the track
had been thoroughly soaked
the day before the final. This
was a fourth Derby win for
Jack Watts, his first being with
Country Boy back in 1931.
New Zealanders have won three
of the last four Derbys—Dignus
(1957), Blue (1959), Sun Chief,
1960 with Tobacco Road
narrowly defeated by Perfect
Lass in 1958. By the imported
American sire My Chief from
Jenny Dillon, Sun Chief was
bred by his owner-trainer, Stan
Easton, of Oamaru.

“Furban”: This was back in
1920. No news of the vital
second Rugby League Test

reached the passengers on the

time it arrived at Tenterfield
(N.S.W.). My father beckoned
a youth who was making short
work of an apple.- “Sonny,
who won the big football-
match?” The question stopped
the munching. Popping eyes,
registering guilt of omission,
accompanied the reply: “Gee,
mister, I clean forgot all about
it. I'll go and find out.” He
queried his way down the plat-
form, butting into many in-
timate farewells, until he was
absorbed by the night, but he
was back just as the train began
to depart. Dejectedly, he gave
the dire news: “What-der-yer-
know, mster — Bolivia beat
Tenterfield by twenty to ten!”
* * *
“Maros”: On a recent visit
to Melbourne I twice saw
Collingwood play. In the first
game ’Wood was very lucky to
win ; in the second, somewhat
unlucky to lose. It beat Haw-
thorn by three points. In the
last quarter, with all the play,
the Hawks kicked 0.8, a
couple of kicks being from
right in front; one through the
middle would have been
enough to win. Against Essen-
don, in the rain and wind on
the Dons’ own Windy Hill,
’Wood lost by two points, after
holding the lead right through
to the last lOmin. It was a-
great achievement, as the Mag-
pies seldom do well at Essen-
don. Collingwood, whose main
fault seemed to be a failure to
look for their full-forward,
impressed me as a real premier-
ship possibility ; the following
week, in mud and rain at Vic-
toria Park, they routed Mel-
bourne. The Demons, of
course, with their “home
ground” advantage in the
finals, must always start with
an advantage in the premier-
ship race.
* * *
“Tiki”: One of the world’s
biggest and heaviest and
fastest footballers is with
the All Blacks —Peter Jones,
6ft. 4in., 17st., and able to
clock almost even-time for
100yds. Jones, a fisherman, is
a member of the Kaitaia Ath-
letic Club, and in a flat paddock
near where they moor their
boats he and his partner, Ken
Rixon, hewed a track of two
95yd. straights and 220yds. in
all. There Jones sharpened his
speed to an amazing extent.
New Zealanders regard him as
their “secret” weapon against
the Springboks.

“Rugger”: Ploughs have
been slicing into Edinburgh’s
famous Murrayfield ground!
In the past matches had to be
postponed because frost made
the ground unplayable, so
veteran Rugbyite Charles Hep-
burn donated a large sum to
the Scottish Union, and now
sunken electric wires, six-inches
apart, run from end to end of
the ground. There are 217
circuits, with fuse-boxes at each
end of the ground. It’s the first
football-ground to be given
“the heat.”

“R ayander”: Wakefield
Trinity accounted for Hull 38-5
before a crowd of 80,000 at
Wembley in the English Rugby
League Cup Final. Wakefield’s
20-year-old Test centre Neil
Fox was responsible for 20
points (10 goals). Well known
to Australians, Hull’s Tom
Harris was voted the player of
the match. Presence of the
Queen, who is giving a differ-
ent sport her presence-patron-
age each year, no doubt had a
bit to do with the big roll-up.

Union player in Australia is

surely Rod Phelps. After scor-
ing four tries against Queens-
land, all fine individual efforts,
he was certain of a place against
N.Z., but had to drop out
through a spot of muscle
damage in the Queensland
game. Last year, when just as
certain, on form, to represent
N.S.W. and Australia against
the Lions, he broke a thumb in
the club competition.

“Paddo”: Dunno if this
applies elsewhere, but that the
popularity of Soccer is not
confined to the cities is cur-
rently demonstrated at Gun-

stronghold, it now has eight
Soccer-teams.

“Baffled”; For some years
Soccer clubs formed in Aus-
tralia by New Australians have
been building themselves on
the strength of players who
have “migrated”—by arrange-
ment with the clubs. Euro-
pean clubs, hard hit by the loss
of stars, view this as a means
of overcoming the “buying”
that has long been part and
parcel of European Soccer.
One Sydney club has paid more
than £7OOO for “migrant”
players; another is bringing
out almost a whole team this
year. Hence the F.I.F.A.
(International Federation) re-
fusal to accept Australia’s
view that the Soccer “migrants”
just want to come to live here
because they like Australia.

“Regel”: Melbourne’s 6in.
of rain which washed-out the
V.F.L. second round caused
the first postponement for 21
years. Some 60 years ago two
Association teams were to meet
on a wet day, but the visitors’
togs had been put in the
wrong train, and the team
refused to take the field in their
best clothes. So the locals had
a grand time on their own, and
soon scored a goal. But the
next scoring kick went behind,
and there was no opponent to
kick-off. Anyhow, the locals
won by 7 points.

“Fern”: Few women have done
such good work for athletics as
Mrs. Doris Magee, now president
of the N.S.W. Women’s Athletic
Association, having handed the
secretaryship over to 25-year-old
Barbara Hodson, whom she trained
for the post for two years. As
Doris Lee, a. fine sprinter at a
time when women athletes of
N.S.W. had no official body, Mrs.
Magee became assistant-secretary
of the Men's Association, and
subsequently was mainly respon-
sible for forming the Women’s
Association. As secretary she guided
it into becoming one of the
strongest bodies, financially and
competitively, in the State’s amateur
sport. Mrs. Magee has also been
secretary of the Australian Women’s
Union since 1937, except for one
brief break, and unquestionably is
one of the most knowledgeable
women in the world on athletics.
In 1948 she was manageress of the
women’s section of the Olympic
team; she took Marjorie Jackson
to Japan in 1952; and now she
will be off to Rome with the
Olympic team as manageress of the
women athletes.

“Athlete”; Herb Elliott

butes to help him in the

His scientific adviser, Forbes
Carlile, has found that Herb
has a heart far more power-
ful than most athletes own
and a frame ideally suited for
his distance. Standing over
6ft. 2in. and lithe-framed, he
has exceptional “fighting
spirit.” His tremendous bursts
of speed result from rhythm-
like running and the power
developed by the heart.

“Footfault’: Jaroslav
Drobny will again be promi-
nent in world-tennis this year
—as manager of the Italian
Davis Cup team. The “Iron
Man” of tennis must have been
one of the gamest triers in any
sport. He kept going back for
nine years before he w.on a
Wimbledon singles final —from
Ken Rosewall in 1954. Three
times before that he had gone
under in the final—-to Ted
Schroeder (1949), Budge Patty
(1950) and Frank Sedgman
(1952). Despite his tennis
honors, he still thinks he was
better at ice-hockey, at which
he played for Czechoslovakia at
18. If he had his time over
again, he said, his game would
be Soccer.

“T.F.”: There was nothing
new about the idea that athletes
should work in a hot-room for
a couple of weeks before leav-
ing for Rome, so they’d be in
shape for the humid weather
they’re bound to strike. Years
ago Sydney physiologists
Forbes Carlile and the late
Professor Frank Cotton con-
ducted tests on the same lines
when they trained swimmers
under heated conditions in a
city indoor pool. Between
them they conducted hundreds
of tests, and the swimmers
certainly improved their times.
Still, it’s doubtful if a couple
of weeks in a hot-room would
be much good for track and
field - games men. Anyway,
overseas athletes who came to
Australia for the 1956 Olympic
Games didn’t require acclima-
tisation. They just ran and
won.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
BLOCKADES AND BOYCOTTS
Summarising the recent tangle
of blockades, counter-block-
ades and boycotts of Middle
East shipping, the Manchester
“Guardian” notes that it is all
“as involved as a Feydeau
farce, although less amusing”:
“The Government of the
United Arab Republic refuses
to allow Israeli ships or even
cargoes to pass through the
Suez Canal—illegally, as most
people in this country and the
United States believe. In re-
“WHO SAYS THEY’RE OBSOLETE?"
(A London “Evening Standard” comment on reports that “regulations governing the testing of old
cars can be expected in August' at the latest.”)
taliation an American trade-
union pickets an Egyptian ship
in New York harbor. Here'
the complications begin, as they
often do when non-Govern-
mental organisations take a
hand in foreign policy. The
State Department makes known
its ‘embarrassment’ at the
dockers’ action, but so far that
action has not been proved to
be iliegal. So the Arabs,
united as never before at a time
when they had previously never
seemed more disunited, boy-
cott American ships touching
their ports.
“Statesmanship would have
been necessary to disentangle
all this even at this point. For
the State Department, however
embarrassed, cannot with pro-
priety take any action which
appears to condone restrictions
on the use of the Suez Canal:
and the Arab countries —none
except Lebanon making much
pretence at having democratic
institutions—cannot understand
why Washington does not put
the New York pickets in their
place. That it does not do so
is taken to mean that it does
not want to —that it is acting
as an instrument of Zionism.
“But then, as if to make sure
that there should be no mistake
about this, the Senate passes an
amendment which links Ameri-
can aid with freedom of naviga-
tion through the Canal. These
are strings with a vengeance,
and if even in the West they
appear to have been trailed for
domestic political reasons,
Arabs may be excused if they
take them to be Zionist strings.'’
London “Spectator,” back-
ing Senator Fulbright’s descrip-
tion of the U.S. Senate motion
as “political coercion offered by
a pressure-group in the US
which seeks to inject the Arab .
Israeli dispute into domestic
politics,” notes that “Israel has
thus furthered the prime aim
of her foreign policy, which is
to ensure bad relations between
the Arabs and the West, though
she has done so at some slight
cost to her second aim—keep-
ing the Arabs divided.
“The explosive Arab reaction
of a counter-boycott of all
American ships was predictable
and is as understandable as it
is misguided. It would have
been far more effective merely
to criticise the Israelis for their
interference with American
affairs and to commiserate with
the U.S. over the activities of
what Senator Fulbright calls an
‘irresponsible maritime union
and a minority pressure-group.’
By their boycott the Arabs will
harm the U.S. and the West
but they will harm themselves
more, and the only beneficiary,
apart from the U.S.S.R., will be
their enemy Israel.
“Israel, prepared neither to
suffer the status quo which, ex-
cept for the Suez Canal ban, is
heavily in her favor, nor to
make the concessions which
would change it, is nevertheless
quite prepared to use Zionist
influence in America to embroil
the West with the Arabs.
“If the U.S. tolerates such
interference in its foreign
policy, there is little Britain
can do about it, least of all in
a Presidential - election year.
All we can do is to understand
what is happening and to hope
that, unlike in the last Presiden-
tial year, Israel will not drastic-
ally overplay her hand.”
London “New Statesman,”
expressing the hope that Presi-
dent Eisenhower will ignore the
Senate motion, notes that, “as
Britain has found to her cost,
an alternation of bribery and
threats is a sure formula for
failure in the Middle East; in-
deed, Mr. Dulles’s handling of
the Aswan aid-scheme in 1956
showed that abrupt and politic-
ally inspired withdrawal of U.S.
aid tends merely to create a
vacuum and invite Russia to
fill it.
“Nevertheless,, though the
affair is unlikely to go beyond
hot words on both sides, it has
been instructive and even en-
couraging. Firstly, the reluc-
tant response of such countries
as Lebanon and Saudi Arabia
(which stand to lose most from
a boycott of U.S. ships) to
Nasser’s appeal shows that
there is an economic limit to
Arab boycott tactics. Secondly,
the question of the Suez ban on
Israel, which the great Powers
and the U.N. find it so conveni-
ent to forget, has once more
become an issue.
“President Eisenhower has
been reminded of his promise,
in 1957, to take stern measures
if the ban were maintained, and
his Administration may now
find it politically profitable to
raise the matter again at the
U.N. From an Israeli view-
point, this is small but welcome
progress.”
East German Answers
Sebastian Haffner, London
‘"Observer’s” resident cor-
respondent in Berlin, who last
week answered some questions
about West Germany put to
him by the London staff of his
paper, now answers a couple
about East Germany:
“Has the East German re-
gime any popular hacking? Is
it ever likely to have?’’
“It has not. And, on present
showing, it is never likely to
have.
“Whether to strive for popu-
lar backing and try to grow
genuine national roots (there
was, after all, a genuine Com-
munist mass-movement in Ger-
many in the twenties and early
’thirties), or whether to rely
entirely on Russian power and
fear of Germany on the one
hand, German submissiveness
and respect for heavy-handed
authority on the other, is a
question which has been de-
bated by the German Com-
munists —and also by the Rus-
sians—for more than 10 years,
and the varying tenta t i v e
answers to this question make
the history of East Germany.

First Party Secretary] has al-
ways stood for the second (at
present entirely dominant)
policy; various German Com-
munist opponents of his, with

Everything in life is relative. The things we
count as achievements, for instance, are relative
to the things that are waiting to be achieved.
That is notably true when we survey the state
of development in Australia today. Some incident
or discovery brings occasionally home to us the
extent of the land that is dormant around us; but,
known or unknown, the potential is always there.
It was there thirty-five years ago, when
sixty-million acres between Maitland (N.S.W.) and
Nebo (North Queensland) had been caught in the
thorny grip of prickly-pear. The ravage was
spreading at the rate of a million acres a year.
Then the patient work of Australian scientists
led them to the perfect natural answer. The
Cactoblastis insect was introduced from the
Argentine; within a few years the cactus was eaten
out. the scourge was gone, and an area larger than
Victoria had been brought in to high productive use.
That was a near-miracle in land reclamation,
it was said, and its like would never happen again.
But it is happening.
A great tract of rich, well-watered land
running in a broken belt from Mackay (Q.) to the
State border, and spilling over for two hundred
miles into New South Wales, lies under the light
scrub known as brigalow. It is to be cleared now in
an operation which will parallel the dramatic defeat
of the prickly-pear.
In Queensland alone there are twenty-three
million acres of it; fifteen-million untouched, the
remainder partly developed.
The way of its winning will be different. The
classic method of clearing brigalow is with crawler
tractors dragging a heavy chain. But the prize will
be the same; the creation of a great new province
of wealth in the Australian soil.
And what does this prove, in terms of the
“relative”? That the conquest of this continent is
still in process; and that other victories, perhaps
unrelated to these, but as rich and fruitful, are
waiting to be won.
various Russian backers, have
at times advocated the first.
“It must be admitted that
the fumbling attempts of the
Communist regime to court
popularity by a milder policy
and concessions to popular
feelings have not been success-
ful. The regime has never been
accepted, no matter whether it
behaved mildly or harshly.
“Herr Ulbricht’s argument
that a population which can-
not be won over had better be
ruled with a rod of iron and
that anyhow a foreign-imposed
revolution cannot succeed if
done by halves does therefore,
from a Communist point of
view, make some sense.
“It is, however, exactly the
same argument and policy with
which Mr. Rakosi in Hungary
prepared the explosion of
October, 1956, and with which
Herr Ulbricht himself, in 1952-
53, already once prepared the
East German explosion of
June, 1953.”
“Do the East Germans care
about German reunion? Are
they more or less nationalist
than the West Germans?”
“In so far as my personal
impressions are any guide, they
do care about German reunion
more than the West Germans,
and in this sense are more
nationalist. It is very natural.:
pending reunion, the West Ger-
mans are fairly comfortably
placed, the East Germans
highly uncomfortably, to say
the least. Reunion, to the West
Germans, is merely a patriotic
duty; to the East Germans it
is an eagerly longed-for escape
from daily-felt stifling oppres-
sion.
“Whether there is more
secretly surviving ‘nationalism’
in the bad sense of the term in
East Germany than in West
Germany is impossible to say.
It is not inconceivable that the
anti-German excesses of the
Ulbricht regime (which, for
example, celebrates the day of
German unconditional surren-
der as one of its two national
holidays) might perpetuate, or
even rekindle, the opposite
political passions. But what
evidence there is points rather
in the direction of a widespread
longing for an apolitical,
private, carefree existence, or
the ‘holiday from history’
which West Germany got dur-
ing the last 10 years and East
Germany missed.
“East German youth, in par-
ticular, shows in its (heavily
discouraged and sometimes
savagely punished) spontaneous
and private activities a quite
overwhelming resemblance to
West German and West Euro-
pean youth, preferring, for in-
stance, blue jeans to jackboots,
and rock’n’ roll to marching-
songs.”
Chou's Tour
/Commenting on Chinese
Premier Chou En-lai's visits
to Burma, India and Nepal,
London “Time and Tide” notes
that Delhi seemed unprepared
for his “imperturbable, im-
movable attitude’’ in discus-
sions of the Sino-lndian fron-
tier : “The alacrity with which
-Peking had’ accepted Mr.
Nehru’s invitation, and indeed
that the invitation had been ex-
tended at all in view of the
Indian Prime Minister’s re-
peated statement that he saw
‘no ground for a meeting’, led
to wishful thinking in many
quarters.
“The Chinese Prime Minister,
however, made it abundantly
clear that China had no inten-
tion of relinquishing the 12,000
square-miles of Indian territory
in Ladakh. He also succeeded
in implying that India was the
aggressor, pointing out with
superb effrontery that Peking
was only administering terri-
tory which was actually in her
possession, whereas Delhi,
while ‘claiming’ that she ad-
ministered the area, had not
even known about the building
of the Sinkiang-Tibet road.
“Mr. Nehru, stiffened by the
very blunt and vocal stand of
the press, of his own Congress
party —and, indeed, of all the
parties save the Communists —
refused to trade China’s recog-
nition of the McMahon frontier
line for the handing-over of the
Ak Sai Chin region of Ladakh.
The fact that the Chinese are
still occupying the area, and
that they have built a further
200 miles of strategic roads in
Ladakh, thus consolidating
their position on Indian terri-
tory at the very moment when
this last Delhi meeting was
being planned, has prompted
the following question in India:
‘What is to stop Peking from
yet further expansion during
the “further study” of the
problem? On paper, China
has claimed nearly 50,000
square-miles of Indian territory,
along the 2500-mile border.
These claims remain unre-
nounced.
“The Nepalese Prime Minis-
ter, Mr. B. P. Koirala, has set
an example to Delhi by his firm
refusal to sign a non-aggression
pact with Peking. This has for
the moment frustrated one of
Mr. Chou En-lai's aims—that
of creating a neutral Federa-
tion of Himalayan States,


which would include Bhutan
and Sikkim.”
However, the New York
“Herald Tribune” notes,
“Chou’s refusal to abate any
appreciable portion of his
claims to territory long accepted
as Indian worsened Red China’s
reputation in Asia, damaged
the already battered position of
the Indian Communists and
aroused Mr. Nehru to some
sharp comments about ‘aggres-
sion.’
“From a practical stand-
point it may be argued that
Chou lost nothing. His armies
are large; their hold on large
sections of India’s North-east
Frontier territory is firm and,
in a military sense, Chou could
laugh-off Indian protests.
“But there is good reason to
believe that the Soviet Union
will discourage any further
forcible adventures by its rest-
less Red associate in the Far
East. Mr. Khrushchev obvi-
ously prefers that additional
Communist gains be made by
propaganda, infiltration, sub-
version and the like.
“The Peking Premier’s re-
turn in a huff, annoyed at the
fact that India insists on call-
ing a spade a spade and aggres-
sion aggression, has only con-
firmed the losses in prestige
which Red China suffered by
its assault on Tibet. The brave
davs of Bandoeng, when Chou
was being introduced to civil-
ised society by Nehru, are
almost forgotten.”
Sea Law
New York “Herald Tribune”
comment on the Geneva
conference on the law of the
sea, which involved 88 nations,
lasted six weeks, and ended in
disagreement:
“Freedom of the seas has
long been a cardinal point of
international law and tradition.
But there has been mounting
disagreement about where the
‘high seas' should be considered
to begin. One nation after an-
other has rejected the tradi-
tional three-mile limit, some
setting four, six or 12 miles,
others claiming as much as 200
miles of open sea as their own.
Generally, the major maritime
nations have held to the three-
mile rule, while the smaller
coastal nations have sought to
extend their sovereignty sea-
ward.
“Fishing-rights underlie much
of the disagreement. Most fish
are caught in the shallow
waters relatively close to shore
—but not necessarily close to
the fisherman’s native shore.
This has led to bitter disputes
between fish-hungry nations
that understandably want their
own coastal waters as a private
preserve, and others who claim
freedom to fish anywhere.
“The original rationale be-
hind setting the limits of
national sovereignty at a
‘marine league’ of three nautical
miles has long since been over-
taken by technical advance.
And indeed, three miles—or
6000yds., as a mariner might
reckon it—is small as sea-dis-
tances go. But at 12 miles
(which a growing number of
nations claim) all but the
largest ships would be out of

Gaitskell’s attempts to unite his party on defence-policy.)
sight to an observer standing
at the water’s edge, so far away
as to be hidden by the earth’s
curvature.
“And’ more is involved than
fishing-rights. The right of
passage through straits and
between islands, air-rights over-
head, rights of coastal naviga-
tion —all affect the status of the
sea as a free avenue of com-
merce and communication.
“A joint United States-
Canadian compromise proposal
would have set a general
six-mile limit of sovereignty,
but would have allowed
the coastal nation an addi-
tional six miles of exclu-
sive fishing-privileges. This won
a heavy majority, but came
one vote short of getting the
two-thirds needed. So the con-
ference ended in failure, with
the major Western Powers de-
claring that they would there-
fore continue to recognise only
the three-mile limit.
“It is, perhaps, a tribute to
our negotiators that they came
as close to success as they did.
The obstacles to agreement —
economic, military and politi-
cal, plus those of pride, rivalry
and tradition—were formid-
able. But failure, and the con-
sequent indefinite continuation
of the present chaos, is galling
nevertheless.
“Our immediate hope now
must be for bilateral or multi-
lateral agreements reducing the
areas of conflict; our long-
range hope for enough changes
of heart to give a future con-
ference better chance of suc-
cess. For recent trends have
smacked badly of sea-grabbing,
and the seas must be kept free.”
Liners' Comeback
Xlj'ROM London “Daily Tele-
graph” :
“In the coming decade of
greater affluence and leisure
the luxury passenger-liner may
not only regain its popularity
as a more leisurely, and what
some would call a more
gracious, form of travel. It
may also fill the role of a
peaceful floating retreat from
our teeming land-mass. This,
at any rate, must be the hope
of the recently integrated P. &
O. and Orient Line companies
who have just formed a new
company to launch a vigorous
sales-drive for passenger-traffic.
“The new company, P. &
0.-Orient Lines Passenger Ser-
vices, Limited, is born into a
gloomy shipping world. To
air competition and excess ton-
nage in general are added the
burden of heavily subsidised
foreign competition, flag dis-
crimination and a host of petty
restrictions distorting the nor-
mal pattern of trade.
“The United States Govern-
ment regulation laying down
that all passengers travelling
by sea from one United States
port to another must go on
American ships is a typical
example. India is following a
course of zealous protectionism
as she' builds-up her infant
shipping-industry. Many ship-
pers feel that their case is being
presented poorly by the Gov-
ernment at an international
level. The image they would
like to see more clearly pro-
jected is that of British shipping
winded by a foul blow rather
than of British shipping on the
decline, overtaken by age and
new fashion.
“Acting as a sales high com-
mand, the new company will
deploy 10 P. & O. and six
Orient passenger-liners around
the world, scooping-up both
the genuine travelling and the
holiday-cruising business where
and when it materialises. At
the same time it will concen-
trate on a heavy promotion-
campaign for the virtues of sea-
travel.
“This strategy of flexibility
has appeal. It may well be that
the ingenuity and vigor of a
new approach of this kind will
do far more to carry the indus-
try into better times than could
any subsidy or retaliation by
the Government against foreign
practices.
“Both on the Atlantic and
the Far Eastern runs the time
may be only just around the
corner when the luxury liner
becomes, in the words of P. &
O.’s former chairman, Sir
William Currie, a convalescent
home for the weary air-travel-
ler.”
Dragnet Digest
London “Observer”: “The
interests of the Western alliance
as a whole are to have one
credible and effective deterrent
in the hands of the United
States so long as Russia also
has one; to strengthen its con-
ventional forces so that we need
never use the deterrent first;
and to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons to any other
countries on either side. A
sensible British defence-policy
would be one which satisfied
these three principles.”

box-head almost blocking out
the sunlight as he peered down
at us, I pointed out to the Pom
the drives we’d made and told
him they were “developmental
works aimed at facilitating pro-
duction of ore.”
He took it all in, watched
with interest while I napped
hard at the rock face and didn't
notice that the specimens I
picked up were the bits I’d
chucked down earlier. On the
surface he asked a few ques-
tions while Paddy dollied the
samples, and was suitably im-
pressed by the tail of gold
which turned-up in the dish.
Then we went back to the camp
for crib, and the sale seemed
to be sewn-up.
A t which point, the Pom
turned out not to be as
silly as he looked —which was
probably just as well for his
mother’s peace of mind, if not
for ours. We got around to
the question of price.
I tried to ask a figure which
would get us all the traffic
would bear, but not so big that
it would become a major deal,
and I picked wrong. I asked
for a thousand-quid. The
Pom’s eyes hooded straight
away.
“Well, Mr. Macpherson,” he
said, “that seems a very reason-
able price. Very reasonable
indeed.”
You could almost hear him
saying, “Too reasonable.” I
cursed myself for having laid
on the sales-talk too thick.
“Of course, you understand,”
he went on, “that I am only on
the business side. I’ll accept
your offer. But, naturally,
the acceptance will be con-
tingent on an examination of
the mice by the company’s
mining-engineer.”
Out went our ray of sun-
shine. I could have cried, only
I was too dry.
Another man rose and re-
filled the glasses.
However (Jock continued),
I did the best I could. I argued
that we couldn’t wait; that a
show going three to four
ounces to the ton wasn’t on the
market every day; that we
wanted settlement there and
then. But I couldn’t win,
though 1 did get one conces-
sion : he would lodge with our
bank in Coolgardie a company
cheque for a thousand pounds,
post-dated a month, and if he
hadn’t withdrawn acceptance
by then, the deal would go
through, the acceptance not to
be withheld unless the engineer
reported the mine was not as
stated by us.
On that basis, we drove him
back to Coolgardie, where he
lodged the cheque, rang his
headquarters in Perth, and told
us the mining-engineer would
be up in three weeks and we
were to meet him and take him
out to the show. The only
good thing in the day was the
look on the face of our bank
manager, Mick McMullin,
“Can you navigate ?”
when he saw the cheque. He
looked like a child who’s been
told that Christmas Day comes
twice a year.
Then he looked at the
date ....
Neither of us said much on
the way back to the show.
Even Paddy realised that that
cheque for a thousand pounds
—and a thousand quid was a
power of money in those days
—wasn’t worth the paper it
was written on. It would take
a mining-engineer about ten
minutes flat to work out that
we’d salted the mine for the
Pom, and that’d be that.
Back at the camp we wan-
dered over and looked at the
show. Spread in an even pile
around the mouth of the shaft
to about four feet high was a
hundred tons or so of mullock,
the result of our sinking on the
reef and the extra sinking and
driving we’d done trying to
find the reef. Down the shaft
was nothing but a few million
tons more mullock, none of it
worth a cracker. And in my
mind I could hear Mick Mc-
Mullin saying, “Well, this isn’t
any use any more,” and I could
see him tearing up that cheque
worth a thousand lovely
fiddlies. It was a sober
moment.
Nobody moved. “I said,” said
Jock, “it was a sober moment.”
Reluctantly, a man got up and
filled the glasses.
“That’s the last until the
end,” someone grumbled.
The sun was nearly down
behind Mt. Noondah.
A nyway (Jock went on), we
fiddled around for the
three weeks, and did a bit more
digging in the hope we might
strike the reef again, but all
we achieved was another fifty
tons of mullock on the surface.
Whpn the time came to meet
the mining-engineer, I drove
into Coolgardie, leaving Paddy
at the show, my heart as heavy
as the black clouds hanging
down almost on the bonnet of
the old ute. It doesn’t rain
much in these parts, but you
know how sometimes there’s
a boomer of a sharp storm,
and that's what we had that
night. For about thirty minutes
it fairly poured down in
buckets, and I was glad to get
to the Denver City, because the
roof on the old bus wasn't par-
ticularly waterproof.
The mining - engineer was
waiting—he'd come down from
Kalgoorlie in the afternoon
and we met-up and had a few
drinks and a bit of a yarn and
arranged to get away after
breakfast. I didn’t mention
the mine and neither did he,
but one look at him was
enough to finish me. He was
a tough, wiry bloke with eyes
as bright as pyrites and just
about as cold-looking; the sort
of bloke who'd have had his
mother cowed from the age of
three. Right away I wiped off
our last lingering hopes.
Next morning, on the way
out, everything was bright and
shiny, and except that the salt-
bush and mulga and salmon-
gums were washed clean, you
wouldn’t have known there’d
been any rain in the storm the
night before. We didn’t talk
much on the way out; I was
trying to think. I nearly came
out and told him he was wast-
ing his time, but I chewed the
words off. You’ve got to keep
hoping, and there was just a
chance I might be able to con-
vince him the reef could be
found again. But a sneaking
look at the dingo-trap he had
for a mouth didn’t fill me with
much hope.
When we got to the camp
Paddy was finishing his break-
fast washing-up, which wasn’t
like him; he usually up
before the crows. He looked


off, and as the last of the haul
was disentangled from the
meshes,The ebbing tide left the
net stranded on the clean sand.
Of course a great many fish
had escaped under the rope be-
fore the net was drawn round
it, but if even a quarter of the
number first surrounded had
been secured the fringed rope
had done its job ; it would have
been utterly impossible to
work with an ordinary net the
foul-ground from which these
fish had been driven.
The proceeds were laid-out
on the beach for inspection and
division. Forty-two. baskets of
small fish, including every-
thing up to eight or ten pounds
in weight; several rock-cod be-
tween ten and fifteen pounds ;
a few beautiful twelve-pound
trevally ( lupo ); several small
rays and sharks; two small
turtles, and a number of octo-
pods and cuttlefish.
Beyond memory were the
fish. And beyond imagination
the colors. The most striking
of them were the many species
of parrot-fish (all of them
gorgeously colored and some
having great beaklike teeth), the
coral-fishes, the trigger-fish
and the leatherjackets. The
grotesque shapes, the theatrical
colors, the infinite variety of
markings was amazing.
T>ut we had yet to see the
** fishes of the coral-pools!
“A bongi-bongi said Lolo.
“We make kava for the fishes.”
And they spent the morning
squatting cross-legged over
bowls in which they pounded
the roots of a native vine into
a real kava massr When the
tide was low this was steeped
in the pools of the coral-reef.
Then the little fish came float-
ing helplessly up, stupefied.
All the fantastic fish that
had been only a fleeting
glimpse were there for the tak-
ing. Square, oblong, heart-
shaped, crescent-shaped, tri-
angular long-tailed and winged,
in all the colors of the rainbow
and many more, the fins often
prolonged into ribbon-like fila-
ments, they were more like
butterflies than fish ; the crea-
tures of a fairy dream.
One repulsively gorgeous
creature with a crimson and
peacock-blue head snapped and
hissed with parrot-like beak
when the fish were stacked into
palm-leaf baskets. Was it an
eel or a sea-snake? Anyway,
Fefita (keeping it apart with a
forked stick) assured us that it
was “kove” (very bad). Not
that it need be poisonous—
the look of it was quite
enough.
What was to become of Ihe
basketloads of glorious little
fish? What a crime to vank
off their gorgeous golden tails!
This didn’t trouble the Ton-
gans. They packed the fish
into banana-leaves, roasted
them, entrails and all, and de-
voured the lot . . . That was
another of our silly cranks, to
want our fish gutted. Accord-
ing to the natives we rejected
the best part of the fish.
Perhaps they were right!
a bit odd, too. Tired. Almost
old. And his arms hung slack
at his sides like the great ape
he was.
As we got out he came
shambling over and I intro-
duced the engineer.
“G’day,” said Paddy, “but
I’m afraid you’re wasting your
time coming here.”
“Just a minute, Paddy,” I
said, fighting to the last. “The
engineer hasn’t had a chance
to look at it yet, and” —
“That’s why I mean,” said
Paddy. “And he won’t get the
chance. Not for a few weeks,
anyway.”
“Why?” snapped the en-
gineer, who didn’t waste words.
“Because,” said Paddy, “the
shaft is full to the neck with
water.”
There was a small silence, in
which you could have heard a
dolly-pot drop. The engineer
looked quickly around, and
said: “Nonsense. You could
sink to a thousand feet around
here and not strike a drop of
water.”
He was quite right of course.
He was no fool; he knew
geology.
“Maybe that’s right,” said
Paddy, “but this water came
from up above. We had a
storm last night and it'filled
the shaft.”
YX/'e walked over and had a
look. Sure enough, the
shaft was full of water to
within three feet of the top.
“There must be a fault in the
formation hereabouts that let
the water in,” I said quickly.
“This, of course, will be a
simple matter for your com-
pany to overcome, and doesn’t
alter the undoubted richness
and value of the mine by a
penny, as you will realise.”
“Where do you get your
drinking-water from?” said
the engineer, taking no notice
of me.
“From a station-well ten
miles away,” I said. “We bring
it over in a forty-four gallon
drum.”
“Well, you couldn’t have
filled it that way,” he said.
“No car-tracks to the shaft,
anyway.”
For the first time since I’d
met him, and probably for the
first time in his life, he looked
uncertain. Indeed he looked
baffled and so did I. Every-
thing was just as I’d left it the
night before. From ground
level, the dump of mullock
around the shaft opening hid
the only change, that the shaft
was full of water.
“I don’t know how you did
it,” said the engineer, “but it
leaves the three-card trick for
dead.”
I looked at him, and for the
first time he looked human.
Even a bit of a twinkle was in
his eyes.
“Now, wait a minute,” I said.
“We can’t be blamed for this.
I swear that that shaft was dry
when I left yesterday after-
noon. How it got filled with
water I don’t know. But the
water certainly doesn’t decrease
the value of the mine, a value
proved by the crushing we had
a month ago, and demonstrated
to your company’s representa-
tive here on the site three weeks
ago.”
I was hot on the track now.
But the engineer was unim-
pressed. He was looking at the
ore-bucket, which was full of
holes.
“No chance of bailing it out
dry enough to allow a proper
inspection, even if we could
make a decent bucket,” he said.
“And in this country it’ll take
weeks to seep away. I guess
that’s it.”
We went back to the camp
for some crib. Paddy was say-
ing nothing. The engineer was
saying nothing; he was trying
to work it out, you could see.
I was doing plenty of talking,
making all the points that the
deal would have to stand.
“All right, you win,” said the
engineer. “I’ll report to the
company that I couldn’t make
the inspection because of the
water, but I’ll make it clear
that I can’t work-out how the
water got there, in this type of
country. They’ll probably go
on with the deal, because
they’re a big company and a
thousand quid means very little
to them, and they’ve got the
figures of your crushing. So
you’re in. Now —tell me how
you did it.”
Of course, I couldn’t. It
was a miracle, although I
didn’t put it in those words. I
didn’t trust him as far as I
could kick him, and I was never
any good at football.
We took him back to Cool-
gardie and set him down, then
went around to make sure Mick
McMullin would have our
cheque on the doorstep of the
company’s bank on settling-
day. He was so carried away
he gave us another twenty-five
quid on the overdraft and we
went to the pub.
Paddy was still saying nothing
at all.
“I can’t understand it,” I
said. “Now tell me, Paddy—
have you got any idea how it
happened?”
“Of course I have,” said
Paddy. “I did it with a shovel.”
I had a good look at him.
He certainly looked exhausted,
but as sane as usual—well, no
sillier, lets say. Then I got it
all from him: he’d seen the
rain coming, and a brilliant
flash has penetrated that thick
Irish head. I told you the shaft
was sunk in a gully—well,
Paddy realised the gully would
run a snap flood in the storm,
He grabbed a shovel, hiked to
the shaft, and shovelled the
mullock-dump away on the
upstream side, so that the water
ran straight into the shaft. The
water was shed into the gully
from miles back, so there was
plenty to fill it up.
It was, if you’ll excuse the
long word, a prodigious feat,
From the time the rain looked
likely until the water started to
run, Paddy hadn’t much more
than an hour to shift about
forty tons of stone out of the
way. And then, of course,
when the shaft was full, he had
to shovel it all back again, just
the way it was, No wonder he
looked tired,
I tell you that Paddy Dal-
rymple was the greatest man
with a shovel that ever lived,
There was a bit of a silence,
then someone, getting up to
refill the glasses, asked: “What
did the mining-company do?’’
Well, now, said Jock, when
they discovered they’d been
taken-in they sent the mining-
engineer back, and he did a
geological survey and they
moved up the hill, banged down
another shaft, found the reef,
and won nearly half-a-million
quid’s worth of gold before it
finally cut-out.
But that’s not the point of
the story: I’ve been telling you
about Paddy Dalrymple, the
greatest man with a shovel the
world has ever seen.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Kimberleys on the Move
One would have thought that
the building of a new township
in one of the most isolated
parts of Australia would have
merited some reference in the
metropolitan press of the
eastern. States; but if it was
mentioned I didn’t see it, and
I subscribe to dailies from
four capital cities. The
“Northern Territory News” of
26/4/’6O, however, does feature
it.
The town is to be called
Cununurra, and will be located
on the Ord, immediately up-
stream from its junction with
the Denham, 60 1 miles from
Wyndham, on country origin-
ally owned by Connor, Doherty
and Difrack.
This is the best piece of news
from the East Kimberleys since
the days when gold was dis-
covered at Hall’s Creek, and
that’s a long time ago. Hawker
Siddeley Brush Pty., Ltd., have
“I’m beginning to wish they'd put a monkey in this one
instead of us , Ivan Ivanovitch!”
the contract to build a power-
station at Cununurra, at a cost
of £BB,OOO.
H. B. M. Voss, the company’s
general-manager in Australia,
remarked to the “NT. News”:
“Installation-work will begin
early in October. Our contract
with the W.A. Department of
Works calls for power to be
actually generating on the 30th
November.” (All I hope is
that the contractors do not
strike an early “wet”; then they
would be in strife, for the road
along the Ord becomes impass-
able after an inch of rain.)
I was over much of the Ord
and Denham Valleys in 1950,
and again in 1953 and 1954.
The only redeeming feature in
the whole situation then was
the Ivan h o e Experimental
Farm, which had conclusively
proved that a number of
tropical crops could be grown
there, including sugarcane, rice
and safflower. In fact, yields
of sugarcane were above the
Queensland average, and their
irrigated pastures and gardens
were a picture.
One could go practically
from one end of the Ord Valley
to the other and never see any-
one save an occasional black-
fellow on walkabout or a
couple of ringers returning
from a muster, apart from the
odd station homesteads, and
these were few and far between.
The initial job of the power-
station, which is the first stage
in the huge Ord River irriga-
tion-project, will be to give
power for pumping water into
the big irrigation-areas nearby:
later, as the town grows, it will
generate domestic and indus-
trial current.
Capacity of the plant will be
1000 kilowatts. Bourke
(N.S.W.), with a population of
3500 and a heavy demand for
water-pumping, managed until
recently with a plant-capacity
of 750 kilowatts.
Maybe in the near future
Wyndham will get an electri-
city-supply. That is one town
where it would make a tremen-
dous difference. —D. C. Tilgh-
MAN (N.S.W.)
Picking and* Prying
In the days before manage-
ment became “scientific,” em-
ployers relied on their own
judgment in choosing a man
for a responsible job, assess-
ing his capabilities on his own
record, statements and personal
qualities in the light of their
experience. How differently big
b usi n e s s—with the aid of
“scientific management”—goes
about job-selection today!
According to reports of an
investigation by the Human
Relations Officer (some title!)
of the British Institute of
Management, big-businessmen
in Britain now give the wives
of their potential executives the
most searching scrutiny before
making appointments.
Candidates are asked to
bring their wives to a dinner
or cocktail-party to demon-
strate that their helpmates can
conduct themselves adequately
on social occasions; the real
reason, the H.R.O. discloses, is
to show-up their husbands in
their true colors.
The personnel experts have
discovered that a man’s per-
sonal qualities—particularly his
truthfulness, capacity for
leadership and ability to “mix”
—can be judged pretty accur-
ately by looking at his wife
and listening to her unguarded
conversation. If she monopo-
lises the table-talk he is obvi-
ously henpecked and has few
leadership powers; if she is
poorly dressed his social rela-
tions are suspect; if she says
something conflicting with a
statement he made when inter-
viewed for the job he is plainly
not to be trusted.
One example given w'as of
an applicant who professed “a
passion for the theatre,” but
whose wife, discreetly ques-
tioned on her preference for
plays, said that they rarely
went to the theatre; result, the
applicant lost the job.
N lf scientific management
means picking a man for a job
by such underhand means as
prying into his private life,
questioning his wife during the
course of alleged “social”
functions, and subjecting both
husband and wife to criticism
under most unfair conditions,
then it is about time manage-
ment was made more human
and less scientific.
Some Australian organisa-
tions already appear to be
copying American and British
management - methods in re-
quiring wives of prospective
executives to be “approved” by

business heads. But if wives
may be critically examined for
such purposes, why not child-
ren? Why not ask a man to
bring along a few of his best
friends for interview or inspec-
tion, on the ground that “a
man is known by the company

I have never yet been asked
to “bring the wife along” in
connection with any job I have
applied for. If I had been, my
reaction would have been that
of most Australians: “Keep

Well, perhaps not quite in

ing the strongest resentment of

ment to a position will depend

a large extent upon what his

Schools and Society
J. M. Thomson in his re-
marks on New Zealand (B.
4/5/’6O) says: “The secondary
schools could be a potential
instrument for cultural change
and social amendment.”
Such an idea could be dan-
gerous, particularly if the refer-
ence is to State schools.
Many years ago Hilaire
Belloc warned that compulsory
education by the State was a
potential instrument to lead
men into a kind of slavery.
Stalin and Hitler, for whom
schools and youth-movements
were most effective instruments
of “social amendment,'’ proved
Belloc right.
If we were all agreed on
desirable cultural changes and
social amendments there would
be no problem, and obviously
we would use the schools to
mould society nearer to the
heart's desire.
Since, however, there is no
such agreement, a democratic
society does not give anyone
the right to use public schools,
which are financed by all tax-
payers, to implement cultural
changes and social amendments
supported by a minority of
those taxpayers.
For better or for worse, State
schools in a democracy must
reflect social change, not initiate
it.—R.A.S. (N.S.W.).
Sarajevo
The review of Joachim
Remak’s Sarajevo (Red Page,
27/4/’6O) is most interesting,
but is wrong in claiming that
this book tells the entire objec-
tiye story of the planning
and murder of the Archduke
Francis Ferdinand for the first
time. The Sarajevo Crime, by
Miss M. E. Durham, was pub-
lished as long ago as 1925.
Miss Durham, who could
speak and write every language
from the Danube to the TEgean
Sea, was one of England’s few
authorities on that tangled mass
of murder and intrigue which
has passed for politics in the
Balkans (save Greece) for the
past century. She had lived
there for years, and collected
an enormous mass of data
which threw an entirely new
light on what had happened.
This she documented, and com-
piled from it a most interest-
ing and readable book, which,
had it been published before
August 4, 1914, might have
affected the whole course of
history.
She claims, I think with jus-
tice, that Austria was right in
serving an ultimatum on Serbia,
and that Serbia resisted, having
an assurance that Russia would
stand by her. Germany had a
treaty with Austria, so was
bound to support her.
The mistake the Kaiser made
was in ordering the invasion
of Belgium, which brought
England into the war, and the
mistake the French made was
in supporting Russia; this they
did to save their enormous
investments in that country.
American jurist Frederick
Bausman, a justice of the
Supreme Court of Oregon, has
some pertinent words on this
in his book Let France Explain.
However, as the Bolsheviks


repudiated all international
loans on seizing power in 1919,
France lost her money any-
way.
The history of both the Bal-
kan countries and Eastern
Europe has not been a happy
one, particularly since 1945;
they would probably have been
a lot better off, both' socially
and politically, had Austria
been permitted to settle her
trouble with Serbia without in-
terference.
For there is no doubt now
that the murder of the heir-
apparent to the Austrian throne
was committed in the full
knowledge that it would lead
to war, and that the Serbian
Government was privy to it.
For years its policy had been
directed towards the destruc-
tion of Austria. —D. C. Tilgh-

Eyes, Ears and Poetry
Despite P.0.M.C.” (B.
11/5/ ’6O), I am still uncon-
vinced that the meaning of
“image” must be confined to
something in the mind, which
can be described in the same
way as something seen with the
eyes can be described, even
though this is the most com-
mon usage of the word.
My quoted definition came
from Drever’s Dictionary of
Psychology, since "I thought
psychologists would be the
specialists concerned with sen-
"I hear there's been a lot of delinquency among
you boys."
sation and perception and,
therefore, the authorities on
what constitutes an image.
I need not have gone past
Webster’s Dictionary, however.
Of seven meanings given there,
none is restricted to
“P.O.M.C.’s” version, but one
supports my view. It is “an
idea ; a representation of any-
thing to the mind ; a concep-
tion ; a picture drawn by
fancy.”
Incidentally, Watt’s Diction-
ary of English Literature refers
to “visual imagery,” so pre-
sumably there is some other
kind.
“P.O.M.C.’s” hypothetical
person who had never had the
use of his senses, apart from
hearing, admittedly could not
have a mental picture of, say,
a “screeching jet” ; but he
could recall the “screeching”
later —an “aural image”—
which satisfies Webster's mean-
ing.— B.E.D. (N.S.W.)
Police and Traffic Laws
Surely the report that a Vic-
torian police-board has fined a
policeman £2O for failing to
obey a stop-sign deserved
banner headlines. Tucked away
in an obscure corner of the
paper on which I rely for my
daily news, it revealed that the
policeman pleaded guilty to the
charge but explained that ho
was not familiar with the area
and did not see the sign.
Imagine how a N.S.W.
policeman would scoff if an
ordinary civilian motorist put
up that excuse to avoid being
booked! He would almost
certainly reply that it was the
motorist's duty to see every-
thing on the road, and that his
failure to see a sign was really
an aggravation of the offence
of failing to stop.
Of course, it is possible to
miss seeing a sign—mainly, I
should say, because they are on
the left-hand side of the road.
A driver sits on the right-hand
side of his car; he is obliged to
give way to traffic on his right;
and yet for some obscure
reason stop-signs are placed on
the left.
On the general principle that
policemen should be obliged to
obey all traffic-regulations the
same as ordinary motorists, the

Pensioners and Insurance
Tell “Benbow” (B. 4/5/’6O)
that my comparison between a
person who pays unemploy-
ment-tax or takes-out a fire-
insurance policy, but receives
no benefit through not becom-
ing eligible for either, and a
person barred from the old-
age pension by the means-test
was the reverse of irrelevant.
The cases are identical. A
favorite argument of means-
test critics is that, since every-
one is taxed to provide the old-
age pension, all, on reaching the
statutory age, should benefit,
Only contributors to unemploy-
ment-relief who lose their jobs,
or fire-policy holders whose
houses suffer fire-damage, re-
ceive payment.
The maternity - bonus and
child - endowment are in a
different category. Their pur-
pose is to stimulate the birth-
rate. In the case of child-en-.
dowment, also, the fact had to
be faced that under the old
method of fixing the basic
wage millions of pounds a year
were being paid to employees
for non-existent children, while
small employers and self-em-
ployed persons with large fami-
lies were getting nothing. The
decision to make child-endow-
ment a social service, indepen-
dent of the basic-wage and
available to all parents, was the
simplest, and probably the most
equitable, solution of the
problem.
I can’t see why the wealthy
should be entitled to draw the
pension. Only about half the
people in the pensioner age-
group are recipients. For all
persons in that bracket to get
it would mean a vastly in-
creased old-age pension expen-
diture; and either the wealthier
of those now barred by the
means-test would gain little or
no benefit, through having to
pay much higher taxation, or
younger people would be bur-
dened to give them extra in-
come they don’t need.
In default of a comprehen-
sive scheme of national msur-
ance, the tendency of many
people nearing the pensionable
age to dissipate their savings in
order to qualify would be
corrected by liberalisation of
the means-test
‘
The amount of property
allowed to a pensioner is too
low. Most who waste their
substance in order to get the
pension have, at best, only a
few-thousand pounds—insuffi-
cient, if invested safely, to
return an income appreciably
above the pension.
Another means of prevent-
ing the dissipation of moderate
fortunes by the elderly would
be the granting of a high rate
of interest say, at least 7
per cent.—on Commonwealth
Bonds-holdings of £5OOO and
under in the hands of persons
of pensionable age. Such
bonds should have the right of
redemption at par, on short
notice, on the lines of the
present 4 per cent. Special
Bonds.—Farinmail (N.S.W.).

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
BULK PICK-UP
From R. A. PRICE
T»ulk pick-up involves cool-
ing milk and holding it on
farms in refrigerated tanks,
from which it is collected and
taken to factories or depots in
large tank-trucks.
The driver of each truck is
trained to judge the quality of
the milk before accepting it.
After acceptance, he measures
its quantity with a dipstick,
takes samples for testing at
the factory and pumps it into
the tank-truck. The time he
spends on each farm varies
between four and 10 minutes.
If used correctly, this method
of handling has many advan-
tages.
Economy
Transport is more economic
and there’s no laborious hand-
lifting of cans, either full or
empty. Once a day, or even
once every two days, is quite
often enough for milk to be
collected. The saving in trans-
port-costs has been found to
be about 15 per cent.
Trials, recently con-
ducted in New Zealand,
have shown that pre-
joining administration
of selenium can greatly
minimise the incidence
of barren ewes on some
types of properties.
The development of
congenital white-muscle
disease in lambs is also
prevented by monthly
dosing of the pregnant
ewes with selenium.
The risks of fly-strike
and other diseases usually
associated with castra-
tion and tailing are
considerably reduced
with the use of Elastra-
tor Rubber Rings.
Elastrator is a speedy,
sure method of mark-
ing and tailing adopted
in this country and
overseas by many
successful breeders and
woolgrowers.
A great deal of can-washing
is done away with. There is
one tank on each farm to be
kept clean —this takes about 10
minutes a day—and one tank-
truck for about 30 farms, in-
stead of about 600 10-gallon
cans to be washed at .the fac-
tory and on the farms.
"If you'd a hit more speed you could have
got out of my Way!"
The quality of milk is much
better. It is cooled to 50deg.
within an hour of milking and
to below 40deg. within two
hours, at which temperature
there is little growth of bacteria.
In the U.S.A. a premium of
between Id. and 2d. a gallon
is paid on bulk pick-up milk.
At the factory there’s a
saving of labor, of machinery
and steam for handling and
washing cans, and also of
refrigeration, since the cooling
is done on the farms.
There is also a saving to the
farmer of the amount of milk
clinging to the inside of cans
when tipped, which is not put
to his credit but wasted down
the drain. This amounts to
about 5 per cent, or 2|d. on
each can.
Additionally, farmers also
save capital- and maintenance-
costs of cans, costs in time and
transport of carting cans to the
road, costs of building qnd
maintaining a milk-stand at the
roadside.
Milk-stands can be a big
item. At least one Shire Coun-
cil will have no makeshift plat-
forms along its roads. In that
Shire stands must be well made,
and must be set back from the
roadway, so that the loading
lorry does not obstruct other
traffic. This possibly means
cutting away a bank and cer-
tainly paving the watertable
and a place for the lorry to
stand —at a total cost of per-
haps £2OO.
Overseas Practice
Bulk pick-up is widespread
in the U.S.A., is established and
increasing in Great Britain, and
has proved quite successful in
New Zealand. It is being used
in Victoria, but not, so far, in
other Australian States (the
bulk milk-tankers we see in
some places are simply trans-
porting milk from one depot to
another).
In the U.S.A. the collection
and distribution of milk is
largely in the hands of private
dealers. They are subject to
Government control, but they
compete against each other in
both buying and selling milk.
Bulk pick-up has been ex-
pended there mainly because it
is good for the dealers, but
producers have found it of
value, too, provided the size and
location of their farms makes
the method economically
sound. It may not be so suit-
able on smaller farms, but
many of these have been forced
to put in bulk-tanks because
the dealers will no longer
handle cans in their areas.
In America milk-receiving
depots own and organise the
tank-trucks and help to finance
the buying of refrigerated bulk-
tanks by farmers. They guaran-
tee loans by the banks, and if
required will take the repay-
ments out of the milk cheques.
The premium on refrigerated
milk and the saving on trans-
port-costs is usually enough to
pay off the loan in three or
four years, leaving a profit to
the farmer for the rest of the
life of the tank—another five
years or so.
in Scotland the Milk Board
organises bulk/' pick-up, and
rebates to the farmer the
resultant saving in costs.
In New Zealand most stor-
age-tanks on farms are not
refrigerated, making the costs
much lower, but this would
hardly be suitable in our
warmer climate. The milk is
cooled by water or by a
refrigerator and held in a
simple insulated tank until next
morning. Not all farms have
electricity, so refrigeration is
difficult, but this system is very
effective for supply to cheese-
factories and drying plants.
In Victoria
Refrigerated tanks are used
in Victoria for milk supplied
to a manufacturing plant. In
this there is the added advan-
tage that milk can be held on
the farms, picked up at any
time and delivered to a pro-
cessing plant as required.
In many ways this system
benefits the factory rather than
the farmer, but if the factory
is owned co-operatively by sup-
pliers then the savings can be
passed-on. On a fairly large
farm there can be savings
enough to make the method
profitable as well as convenient.
On a farm producing about
200 gal. a day costs might be
something like this;
300-gal. cooling-tank, £l6OO.
Installation, £5O.
Good road to dairy, £6OO.
Total capital outlay, £2250.
Interest, depreciation, repairs,
electricity and daily cost of wash-
ing tank, £407 a year.
For comparison, the costs of
the can-system would be some-
thing like:

Your Opportunity to
Invest in Australia's Top Rams
HADDON RIG SIRES!
When the Sydney Ram Sales open on Monday, 6th
June, a really outstanding Haddon Rig team will go
under the hammer. Although comparisons are difficult,
especially in view of the Stud’s remarkable successes in
recent years, experienced judges regard these rams as
the finest to leave Haddon Rig for a long time.
Five Haddon Rig Special Stud Rams, 24 Stud Rams
and 28 Specially Selected Rams will be offered by
Goldsbrough Mort & Company, 20 Stud Rams by
Dalgety & Company and 20 Specially Selected Rams by
Elder, Smith & Company. A remarkable uniformity, so
typical of Haddon Rig Sires, is particularly noticeable
throughout the team that will represent Australia’s
premier Merino Stud.
For the last three years Haddon Rig has sold the
highest-priced Merino ram, and last year secured the
record average for Stud Rams (£693) and, with an
aggregate of £41,422, took the honours for the twentieth
consecutive year.
You will be in good company when you bid for Haddon
Rig 8100d —the strain that over 200 Registered Studs
and countless flocks find so profitable.

the cost of bulk-handling, the
figure of £355 is about equal
to the low figure of £352 for
cans. The high figure for cans
is about £3OO more than for
bulk.
Cost of the bulk-system
might also vary. The road to
the dairy might already be good
enough for a heavy tanker, or
it might cost much less than
the £6OO a half-mile quoted.
These figures are merely esti-
mates for larger farms in a
fairly good district. They are
based on discussions with
farmers, makers of milk-tanks,
and bankers, and on published
information from many
sources, but they are still only
starting-points for examination
of each different situation.
Refrigerated Tanks
There are two types of
refrigerated farm-tanks the
direct-expansion type, in which
the walls of the tank are cooled
directly by refrigerant gas, and
the ice-bank type, in which
water is cooled and then
pumped round the wails of the
tank.
The direct-expansion type is
cheaper to run, but the ice-
bank type will not freeze the
milk solid and it has a reserve
of cold water that will carry-on
in emergencies. In Victoria
some .farmers use this reserve
to take advantage of off-peak
rates for electricity.
Conclusion
There are many points to be
considered, and no two farms
will be exactly alike. A great
deal depends on the attitude
of individual farmers to such
an innovation. To some it
might be welcome, whatever
the cost, as a refinement which
releases them from irksome
chores. To others it might
appeal as a worth-while
economy, but these will have
to make sure that time and
energy saved is not wasted, but
is invested in some other
activity which will return the
costs of the improvement and
perhaps a bit more.
Each farmer will have to
make up his own mind, but
co-operative factories and
depots should take on the job
of investigating and organising
systems of bulk-milk pick-up,
and the sooner they begin it
the better.
Corn Yields
“Heresone”: I checked-up
“The Boomer” (B. 20/4/’6O)
and counted the grains in a
half-ounce of corn —66. It
was not very fine grain, but
about as good as the average
sample of hybrid seed.
That makes 2112 grains to
the pound and, say, 112,000 to
the bushel. At a planting-rate
of 81b. an acre that would give
16,000 grains to the acre, near
enough to “The Boomer’s”
figure.
Corn must be about the king
of grain-crops in ratio of pro-
duction to seed planted. In
1955-56 (last really good sum-
mer round our part of Queens-
land) I planted seven acres with
one bushel of hybrid seed. An
acre, or a bit more, was picked
and fed to the pigs before it
was ripe. The rest was picked
by hand and some more went
to the pigs during picking, but
I had 126 bags when it was
threshed. If the whole crop
had been threshed it could
hardly have been less than 150
bags—a ratio of yield to seed
of 450 to 1. And this is a long
way from a record ; in more-
favored areas I have heard of
better crops, although in those
districts planting-rates may be
higher.
Cape York Beef
“Myall”: The Queerah meat-
works, at Cairns (Q.), rebuilt at
a cost of £250,000 and reopen-
ing this month, will send six
trial shipments to the U.K.
before the end of the year.
Vessels will sail through
Torres Strait, taking 26 days
for the voyage—only a few
days longer than from Argen-
tina to British ports —whereas
previous shipments used the
southern route, which often
involved voyages of up to 60
days. Only the primest beef
will be shipped, and the man-
agement is confident that North
Queensland chilled-beef will
compete well with the world's
best.
The new meatworks, most
modern in the Commonwealth,
will treat 640 cattle daily, and
will operate throughout the
year. Shop-freezers down to
40deg. below zero, will instant-
freeze beef, cutting freezing-
time by as much as two days.
Huge refrigerated semi-trailers
will take 20 tons each load
from works to wharf, where
the beef will be stored in a cold-
room with a capacity of 2000
tons.
To ensure a continuous
supply of high-grade cattle
three cattle-ships will run a
shuttle-service between Cairns
and Darwin and the Gulf cattle-
ports. Special loading-stages
have been erected at Karumba,
near Normanton, and at the
mouth of the Albert River,

near Burketown. Two of these
vessels will carry 500 head each
trip and the other 300 head.
The cattle-barge Wewak has
been fitted with an extra steel
deck, more than doubling her
carrying-capacity to 400 head
a trip, and will continue to ply
between Cairns and the cattle-
ports on the east coast of Cape
York. The reopening of the
road from Coen to Port
Stewart will enable hundreds
of prime cattle to be shipped
in the Wewak, instead of being
driven overland.
The building of a good road
from Cooktown to Mareeba
has meant that a road-train
service can. be established to
pick up cattle from Cape York
stations. The train consists of
a diesel-powered primemover
and two trailers 109 ft. long,
capable of carrying 80 to 85
cattle a trip. The 200-mile
journey from Cooktown to
Mareeba railhead is travelled
in about eight hours, compared
with weeks of droving-treks.
As Mareeba is only 45 miles
from Cairns by rail, the total
distance could be covered in
about 16 hours. Recently a
mob driven from Laura to
Mareeba—about 135 miles—
took five weeks to complete the
journey.
About Drenching
“Windy”: Antibiotics have
superseded most time-honored
veterinary remedies, but there
are still some medicines which
have to be given as a drench.
It looks simple enough when
you see an experienced stock-
man or vet. on the job, but
you can lose a valuable animal
if you are careless.
Here are a few absolute
don’ts associated with
drenching.
Don’t drench a cow with
milk-fever. In this disease the
throat-muscles become para-
lysed and it’s a safe bet that
some of the drench will “go
down the wrong way.” There
is only one result to this —
pneumonia, which usually
proves fatal.
Don’t drench a cow that's
in a bad way with bloat. The
pressure of the gas in the
rumen will affect the breathing.
Some of the drench may get
into the lungs, and once again
cause pneumonia. Similarly, a
cow or horse suffering from
choke should never be
drenched.
Don’t hurry. If a few
seconds means the difference
between life and death, the
drench, which is slow-acting,
will not help much. Take your
time ; don’t try to force the
drench down too quickly ; and
never attempt to drench a
beast through the nostrils —
that’s the quickest way to
kill it.
Always make sure you have
a suitable drenching-bit or
bottle. For horses a drench-
ing-bit will repay itself many
times over. You need not
rush, and there is practically
no risk of any of the fluid going
down into the lungs.
For cattle a long-necked
bottle is the shot. You can
get away with an ordinary
beer-bottle provided you fit a
milking - machine teatcup-
inflation over the end to give
a bit of extra length. You
want that extra length on the
bottle to get the fluid over the
back of the tongue.
When drenching a cow
don’t hold the head too high.
Just raise it slightly and push
the bottle in along the side of
the jaw, so that the cow can’t
bite on the glass or rubber
inflation. Raise the end of the
bottle slightly, and allow the
fluid to gravitate into the cow's
mouth. If the animal coughs,
stop at once —coughing may
suck some of the drench back
into the lungs.
If you are drenching sheep
you'll need a smaller bottle,
but the principle is the same.
Pigs are different. A good
way is to cut the toe out of
an old boot, let the pig bite
on that and then pour the
drench into it slowly, so that
the fluid does not enter the
animal’s mouth too quickly.
An old bullock’s horn,
hollowed-out, and with the
tip cut off the end, is quite
good, too.
When drenching sheep with
the drenching-gun never force
the nozzle roughly into the
mouth. Abrasions can be made
on the soft lining, are difficult
to heal, and are a possible
source of entry for tetanus
germs. The end of the drench-
ing-nozzle should be rubber-
tipped or made of some softer
plastic material.
A final word on preparation
of drenches. Make sure that
all ingredients are thoroughly
mixed into the fluid. A heavy
deposit at the bottom of the
bottle may cause the animal to
cough and choke, with possibly
fatal results.
Never give an animal a very
hot drench. It may not appear
very hot to the hand, but still
may be hot enough to burn
the tender lining of throat and
mouth. On the other hand,
don’t give the drench too cold.
Blood-heat is the ideal tempera-
ture. The ingredients of a
drench should never be irritat-
ing. Some have drenched
animals with heavy doses of
turps and such other sub-
stances as formalin. These
preparations are very irritating
to the mucous membranes.
Even if they cure the com-
plaint, the trouble they cause
may be worse.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(12/5/’60)
- Rainfall should be patchy in Queensland during June,
although good rains are likely on the coast, Darling Downs,
central highlands and part of the Maranoa. Falls should be
poor during July, but reasonably good in a large part of
the State during August.
Good rains are indicated for N.S.W. during June, except
for areas in the far west and along the Darling. Heaviest
rains are indicated in the central and southern divisions
with consequent flooding. There should be light to moderate
patchy rains in July, and reasonably good rains during
August.
Rainfall should vary from light to moderate in Victoria
during June, although good rains are likely in the west-coast
and East Gippsland areas. Reasonably good rains are likely
during July; falls should be patchy during August; and there
should be general rains in September.
South Australia should receive only light to moderate
rains during June, with poor falls in the interior. Reason-
ably good rains are indicated in the agricultural areas during
July, with moderate rain extending into the interior.
Moderate rains are likely in the agricultural areas of
Western Australia, and also the Gascoyne. Good
indicated for the Fortescue; poor rains elsewhere.

Cotton Culture
“Ruddigore”: I agree with
F. H. Finch (B. 13/4/'6O) about
the danger of cropping the
same ground year after year
with cotton.
Principal cotton-districts in
Queensland are the Upper
Burnett and the Callide Valley,
and they still show the ravages
of the 1920 s and 19305, when
cotton was grown on the same
soil continuously for 10 or 15
years.
The soil, by constant cultiva-
tion, lost its structure. Bull-
head, pig-weed and suchlike
plant-pests took-over, and cul-
tivation-costs to keep them in
check became prohibitive. The
result was a sandy waste with a
covering of every known weed,
relieved only by a thin scatter-
ing of native grasses. Now
that methods of cultivation
have progressed, thanks to
modern machinery, it is no
longer necessary to flog the
same patch of ground year
after year.
One point on which I can't
agree is that legumes, especi-
ally lentils, should be planted.
Exhaustive tests in these dis-
tricts by the State Department
of Agriculture show that
Rnodes-grass is the best rota-
tion with cotton. It uses excess
nitrogen in the soil (which
produces all bush and no
cotton), and it rests the land.
As cotton is now grown as part
of a farm-programme—instead
of being, as it once was, the
only source of income on the
place— this rotation completely
suits most farmers, since the
majority raise beef or run a
dairy-herd.
Seeking a higher return from
the rotation, many are plant-
ing the old cotton-paddocks
with mixtures of Rhodes-gras9
and panic and buffel-grass.
The paddock is allowed to seed,
and the seed is harvested with

a special attachment on an

This seed-mixture fetches a
high price on the market and
is in great demand in the briga-
low country further west. Loss
of the seed on the ground is no
disadvantage, as the sward will
stand up to three or four years’
growth without losing its
vitality. After that time the
area is ripped-up and replanted
with cotton.
Studies at the Biloela Ex-
perimental Station in the Cal-
lide Valley have shown that the
yield of cotton from old
ground is more than trebled
when the land is rotated for
three or four years with
Rhodes-grass. Subsequent cul-
tivation-costs, when cotton is
planted again, are halved. This
is the only way the farmer has
of beating rising costs, and
most are taking advantage of
the lessons taught.
Pony Instructors
The Pony Club Association
of N.S.W. plans to hold a

ney on June 4 and 5. Each
pony-club in the metropolitan
area will be allowed to nomin-

school, which will be conducted-
by the association’s chief-
instructors' panel, under the
chairmanship of A. J. McLean,
of Narromine.
"Top-end" Cattle
D. C. Tilghman: The pas-
toral problem in the Northern
Territory has always been one
of seasons; the whole of
tropical Australia has two, a
“wet” and a “dry.” Some
years, particularly in the Terri-
tory and North-West, the “wet”
may be late, not arriving until
November, or even December,
and ending in March. Again,
early storms may come in Sep-
tember, and the rains not end
until April or even May.
Seasonal conditions are
naturally reflected in the quality
of the cattle. A bullock may
put on 3001 b. during the “wet,”
and then lose 25 per cent, of his
total weight during the “dry”—
perhaps more if the “dry” is
protracted, for by the end of
August there is practically no
nutriment in the native pas-
tures. Moreover, all surface
water dries-up, and stock may
have to travel long distances
for a drink, resulting in still
further loss of condition.
So it may take up to five
years to bring a bullock up to
a marketable weight if native
pastures are his sole means of
sustenance. Three-and-a-half
to four is common.
However, thanks to
C.5.1.R.0., it looks as if things
will alter. According to a
report in the “N.T. News,” Dr.
Mike Norman, chief of the
Katherine research-station for
most of the past four years,
has confidently predicted that
the extensive use of protein-
feed, pastures and annual crops
could bring a twentyfold in-
crease in “Top End” beef-
cattle production per acre.
C.5.1.R.0. scientists being ex-
tremely conservative in making
predictions, this statement is
remarkable.
Dr. Norman spoke of experi-
ments conducted at the station,
and of how, with balanced
feeding, beasts had put on as
much as 2401 b. in 16 weeks, or
2|lb. a day; adding that such
weight-gains would normally
take up to two years if stock
were entirely dependent on
native pastures.
These results had been ob-
tained by use of permanent
pastures consisting of buffel-
and birdwood-grasses, Towns-
ville-lucerne and annual fodder-
crops such as bullrush-millet.
Dr. Norman reckoned that the
bullrush-millet grew so densely
and to such a height that his
colleague took a compass with
him when he went into the
millet-field to take samples.
At the Katherine in 1950 and
1953 I saw something of Wally
Arndt’s patches of Townsville-
lucerne, which he had not long
established. Actually, the name
is a misnomer. It is neither a
lucerne nor did it originate in
Townsville. According to the
late John Mitchelmore, of
Mackay; who enthusiastically
planted it all over the Pioneer
Valley he never went for a
drive without a pocketful of
seed, which he scattered here,
there and everywhere—-it was
brought to Townsville in the
seventies or ’eighties when
horses were being exported to
India for remount purposes,
Indian-grown chaff, brought in
the boats to feed the animals,
apparently had a mixture of
Townsville” in with it. It
took kindly to its new habitat,
and has proved a valuable
fodder. Legumes have always
been a problem in the tropics,
and Townsville-lucerne looks
as if it might be the answer.
The present turnoff in the
“Top End”—the tract of coun-
try from the Katherine into
Darwin, watered by the Kathe-
rine, Daly, Margaret, Mary,
Alligator and Finniss Rivers
and their tributaries—is about
20,000 head a year. An increase
such as Dr. Norman envisages
would mean an output of
400,000 head—more than twice
what the whole of the Northern
Territory annually produces.
The Top End,” compared
with the Barkly Tableland, the
Victoria River country and
portions of the Roper Valley,
is second-class cattle country;
so what could the whole Terri-
tory do if the feeding prin-
ciples described by Dr. Norman
became accepted practice?
WOOL SAMPLES
Actual wool samples are
attached to and classified on
Wool Type Card. This Card
has many uses—-as growers,
classers and students in most
parts of Australia have dis-
covered—in particular when
snap classification has to he
made in the yards or shed,
or in the paddock, with, a
type, perhaps, outside the
main run of your experience.
There’s a big difference be-
tween knowing and guessing.
A comparison study, using
the Bradford Wool Type
Card, eliminates the possi-
bility of error. Your name
and address and a postal
note for 7/6 addressed to
“The Bulletin” will send one
on its way.
Tobacco
“Salopian”: Minister for
Primary Industry C. F. Ader-
mann is confident that tobacco-
growing is developing into a
major Australian primary in-
dustry.
The Central Tobacco Ad-
visory Committee, at its annual
meeting in Canberra at the end
of April, discussed the progress
of research and extension-
work in the industry and
worked-out plans for the future,
Production problems include
such diseases and pests as blue-
mould, nematodes and leaf-
miners, and, of course, there’s
always the question of the
chlorine-content of the leaf,
Last year T4,000,0001b. of
leaf worth £7.7 million was
produced in Australia, an all-
time record. Figures for the
1959-60 season are not yet
final, but it looks as if pro-
duction will be around the
20-million-pound mark.
Adermann attributes this in-
crease in the crop to the joint
efforts of Commonwealth and
State Governments, C.5.1.R.0.
and manufacturers and
growers.

strengthening "the conquest for
Spain. Two attempts by British
forces to occupy Buenos Aires in
1806, when France and Spain were
allied against Great Britain, were
repulsed. These victories were
achieved by the colonists without
assistance from the home army,
and in 1810 the Argentinians

Who were known as the
“University Wits”?
It was a name given to a group
of Elizabethan writers, including
Marlowe, Nashe (both of Cam-
bridge), Peel, Lyly, Lodge (of
Oxford), Greene (of Oxford and
Cambridge) and possibly Kyd. All
brilliant, they went down from
their universities inspired by the
great Renaissance of literature and
determined to conquer the literary
world in London. They found that
brilliance wasn’t enough. All except
Lyly endured abject poverty and
all except Lodge died young and
at the height of their powers. They
were the founders of the “Grub
Street” tradition and, through their
bold experiments, of much that is
great in modern English literature.
Marlowe developed the blank-verse
line, Nashe the novel; Lyly intro-
duced euphuism and the conceit;
Peel and Greene were of that
versatile excellence that can turn
its hand to anything; and Kyd
wrote the most popular tragedy
of the age. They were probably
the most sincere, though not the
most polished, of English writers,
and the most picturesque represen-
tatives of probably the most
picturesque age in English history.
How did the term “yellow
journalism” originate ?
It derived from the appearance in
1895 of a number of the New York
“World” in which a child in a
yellow dress (“The Yellow Kid”)
was the central figure of the car-
toon, this being an experiment in
color-printing designed to attract
readers.

shire, North and South Carolina,
Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and
Virginia.

Is Stradivarius considered a
greater violin-maker than Amati ?
Were there other celebrated makers
in the Stradivarius family other
than Antonio ?
Antonio Stradivarius (or Stradi-
vari) was Amati’s pupil, but he
outshone hjs master; his violins
are considered without peer. The
more famous ones still in existence
are the Viotti, Ernst, Alard and
Emperor; his Paganini viola and
Piatti ’cello are also considered the
best of these instruments extant.
Antonio had two sons, Francesco
and Omobono, who succeeded him
in the craft, but they are not
considered in the same class as
their father. Antonio lived from
1644 to 1737.
How did the term “cabal”
originate ?
It comes from the French cabale,
which derives from the Hebrew
cabbala or kabbalah, and was
applied in King Charles ll’s time
to the Privy Council, known as the
Committee for Foreign Affairs, tne
forerunner of the Cabinet. The
connection here was pointed by the
fact that the word was spelt by
the ’ initial letters of the names of
the five Ministers —Clifford, Arling-
ton, Buckingham, Ashley and
Lauderdale, who signed the treaty
with France in 1673. The term
has come to mean a body of
intriguers, or a secret intrigue or
conspiracy.

6d... ..F.D.Y. (N.Z.): The posi-
tion regarding observance of Anzac
Day in the various States is as
follows: N.S.W., Victoria and
S.A., open after noon; Queens-
land, W.A. and Tasmania, closed
all day. Anzac Day in Victoria
had always been a closed day
till this year, but in each of the
other States the present circum-
stances have existed since the
inauguration... .M r s. M.H.M.:
Tyrrell's Bookshop, 202 George
Street, Sydney, advises that the 25
volumes of the Melrose edition of
Scott’s novels would be worth
approx. ss. each; other matter
being followed up... .G.C.V.: It
is impossible to appraise a violin
from a description of the label
only; the cost of revarnishing and
polishing would depend on its con-
dition. If you can get it io them,
A. E. Smith and Co. Pty., Ltd.,
9 Hunter Street, Sydney, the leading
violin experts, will value it with-
out charge and also quote on
restoring... .T.W.C. (Q.): Even
though you have signed the request
addressed to the Medical School
of the University, it would stilt
be advisable to include the proviso
in your will, duly witnessed by
at least two persons. You should
also instruct your executor about
the matter, so that he can take the
appropriate action immediately on
your death... .H.W.: (a) The
name of the Spanish ball-game
played with a cesta (basket) on the
arm and fastened to a glove is
called Jai-alai, and originated in
the Basque country of Spain in
the 17th century. Eight balls
about the size of baseballs are
used in a game. It calls for great
strength, skill, endurance and dex-
terity, and it is usually regarded
as the world’s fastest game. ( b ) It
would be a matter of opinion as
to whether squash or basketball
would be the next two fastest games.

New Recordings
The Symphony, The Opera,
and Bits and* Pieces
The week’s releases include
Brahms’s Fourth Symphony,
from Deutsche Grammophon
(LPM 18567), a superb read-
ing with the Lamoureux
Orchestra under Igor Marke-
vitch. This E Minor has been
called Brahms’s King Lear;
the reference is not to tragic
content the work, though
cast throughout in sombre
garb, is a stream of lyrical
beauty—but to the gathering-
together by the composer of
all his experiences and his
skills to pour them into a
work of true greatness his
last essay in the form.
Especially in the flowing
melodies of the andante— the
richest slow movement Brahms
wrote —and in the marvellous
Chaconne-form final section,
with its splendid woodwind-
choirs, Markevitch and his
forces achieve playing worthy
of the material.
With Verdi’s opera now on
the boards at Sydney’s Eliza-
bethan Theatre, the release
from Philips of Rigoletto
Highlights (A02005L) is
timely. The Duke is America’s
Richard Tucker, whose tenor
is obviously a virile product
of the bel canto school. Gilda
is Gianna d’Angelo, a colora-
tura of quality and warm
expressiveness; and the
hunchbacked jester is sung
powerfully by R e n a t o
Capecchi. The singing of
almost all the best arias and
concerted numbers —including
the great Quartet —is backed
by the very competent
Orchestra and Chorus of
Naples’s San Carlo Theatre.
Outside the complete record-
ing, this is the best and most
comprehensive collection of
excerpts from the opera that
has appeared on LP.
In Beecham Encores, from
Coronet (KLL 594), the vola-
tile Sir Thomas takes his
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra
through six choice concert-
pieces which he has taken from
the context of works, most of
them from lyrical productions
now rarely performed. These
pieces have proved enormously
popular with Beecham
audiences, and rightly so. They
include the lovely cantilena-
like Last Sleep Of The Virgin
from Massenet’s now-forgot-
ten sacred-drama, La Vierge ;
The Overture to and the
March from Berlioz’s power-
fully original The Trojans At
Carthage; the March from
Sibelius’s Karelia Suite and the
incidental music from the
same composer’s The Tempest
—the latter shatteringly evoca-
tive of elemental ragings—and
the March from Rimsky-
Korsakov’s opera Le Coq
d’Or. All done in the best
Beecham manner which
means done as well as can be
by any living conductor.
H.M.V.’s Variety Series has
Carnival Time (OELP 5044),
which plays eight fascinating
variations on the fun-and-
games theme from composers
of the Romantic school. „ The
Frenchman Berlioz contributes
again, this time with his
sparkling evocation of the
Roman scene, Carnaval
Romaine; his compatriot
Saint-Saens weighs-in with the
graceful The Swan, this taken
over by a ’cello and two
pianos ; the old warhorse,
Carnival of Venice, is richly
caparisoned in glowing har-
monic colors; Carnival in
Paris is seen through the Nor-
wegian eyes of composer
Johan Svendsen ; there is the
swirling antics of Stravinsky’s
puppet - doll dance from
Petrouchka; that exquisite
morsel, the Chopin episode,
from Schumann’s Carnaval;
the glimpse of Spanish re-
ligious pageantry afforded by
Albeniz in the Fete-Dieu sec-
tion of his Iberia ; and, wind-
ing it up, the Polonaise from
Chabrier’s Le Roi Malgre Lui.
In Strauss Waltzes For
Dancing, on a Coronet press-
ing (KLP 859), Sammy Kaye
takes 12 of the Vienna Waltz
King’s best-known numbers,
ranging from Tales From The
Vienha Woods through Artist’s
Life to the famed Emperor
Waltz and, without in any way
detracting from their basic
elegance, gives them an extra
shot of effervescence by
arranging them in more synco-
pated dance-tempo. Some of
the more extravagant
“flourishes” of the originals
have been pruned to good
effect.
Popular Recordings
Two orchestras well known
through radio and each with a
long list of popular recordings
behind it have checked over
their repertoire and produced
another collection apiece.
Andre Kostelanetz, working
under the Coronet banner, can
hardly fail to please his fans;
every one of the eight Kostela-
netz Favorites (KLL 592) is
already a favorite in its own
right the world over. This
collection starts with Gade's
“Jealousy” and “Romance in
E-flat Major,” the Rubenstein
piece which has been torn to
shreds by the songwrights of
Tin Pan Alley, and proceeds
with two devotionals—“ln a
Monastery Garden” (Ketelby)
and Nevin’s “The Rosary.” On
the other side De Falla's
“Ritual Fire Dance” and
Drdla’s “Souvenir” point the
way to Saint - Saens’s “Le
Cygne” and the bracket is com-
pleted with “Yours is My Heart
Alone,” from the Franz Lehar
operetta “Land of Smiles.”
Mantovani, recording for
Decca, has also collected favor-
ites, but of more recent vintage.
There's a dozen, all from films,
on disk LKA 4316 More Man-
tovani Film Encores. Pieces
which gave their names to pic-
tures (or vice versa) include
“The High and the Mighty,”
“A Certain Smile,” “Tammy,”
and “April Love.” Others,
which emerged from films to
stand on their own feet as hit-
tunes, include “Que sera, sera,”
from “The Man Who Knew
Too Much” and “Fascination’’
from “Love in the Afternoon.”


Women's Letters
SYDNEY
Of course theatrical news was the big
news of the week, with true theatregoers
searching their , hearts to find whether
they should go to the opening night of
“My Fair Lady” at the new Her
Majesty’s, or “Salome ’ at the Eliza-
bethan.
The fact that it was the resurrection of
Her Majesty’s in Sydney after 28 years
decided many people, though the Gover-
nor and Lady Woodward, the Premier and
Mrs. Heffron, Sir Bernard and Lady
Heinz, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Post, Mr.
and Mrs. A N. Finlay and Mrs. Neil
Hutchison (her husband is overseas) were
at the opera.
Her Majesty’s, formerly the Empire,
has been redecorated and a semicircular
foyer lit by glittering chandeliers created
by cutting off a section of the back-stalls.
Of course everyone did their best to
match the decor sartorially, and the dis-
play of silks, jewels artd furs gave a lift
to Sydney’s sadly declining first-night
glamor.
Mrs. C. R. McKerihan, in a draped
green sheath, was accompanied by her two
daughters, Mrs. C. W. B. Hack and Dell,
all of them affirming that the production
was “better than the New York one, ’
an opinion also voiced by others. Mrs.
Walter Kerr, in a dark-blue Chantilly
dress, was present with her daughter,
Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere, who wore a short
sheath of pale-blue guipure. Other noted
first-nighters were Sir Harry and Lady
Moxham, Mr. and Mrs. Lennox Bode,
Mr. and Mrs. Norman Mulroney and
Mr. and Mrs. David Klippel with
daughter Dianne. Miss Anne Tait, who
was with Mrs. Harald Bowden, wore a
ballerina dress of peach taffeta.

A special birthday-party to be men-
tioned is that of Mrs. O. J. McDermott,
of Vaucluse, for the celebrations lasted
over a full week. It started with a dinner
at Caprice and ended with a buffet-dinner
at the home of Mr. and Mrs. David
Morgan (Rose Bay), where all 20 mem-
bers of the family were present. Mrs.
McDermott is the mother of 10, and,
despite her 85 years, was the life and soul
of the party. After the dinner the guests
were entertained by a sketch specially
written by John Macken and acted by
himself and his parents, Mr. and Mrs.
“Bud” Macken.

Even those who think that dogs should
not be dressed-up would have applauded
the Dog and His Fashions parade at
David Jones’ during the week. Organised
by the N.S.W. Women’s Dog Club in
aid of Guide Dogs for the Blind, it was
a sheer delight. One was not surprised
to be pleased to see a poodle in a
diamente collar, or in a red raincoat
with a zipper down the centre-back, or
in a lame coat trimmed with white
ermine ; nor by a dear little Pekinese
in a green sweater with a white polo-
neck ; but the complete appropriateness
of the mustard suede jacket (with but-
toned-across chest-piece) worn with such
dignity by a boxer, and the little mink
collar round the neck of an elegant
whippet, were revelations.
Other little fashion-points to be noted
at this unique parade included the im-
ported French coat in pink tweed worn
by a wire-haired terrier (a handkerchief
stuck in the pocket), the copy of a
French model worn by the Sydney silky
terrier (he’s only just been admitted to
the American Kennel Club, you see),
the two black cockers in dark - red
smoking-jackets (one with a pipe in the
pocket), and the lurex-thread jacket with
the lilac lead sported by that enchanting
little dog, the shih tzu, only recently
come to Australia and guaranteed to
win the hearts of all who see him.
Mrs. John Trenerry is president of
The Baby Bunting committee which
works for The Women’s Hospital
(Crown Street ) and which this year has
set as its target £800 towards the pro-
vision of a Baby-heartbeat machine for
the hospital. (Last year the committee
raised £500 for a stainless-steel cot for
the hospital ) Mrs. Trenerry’s photo is by

A hair-do built up on a bird’s-nest is
something we never thought we would
see, but something of the sort arrived
in Sydney last week when the latest
hair-styling trends were shown by world-
famous hairdresser Monsieur Luzic.
The “birds’-nest” is woven of hair and
inverted on top of the head, then one’s
own hair is combed over it smoothly to
give an elongated effect. The style is
called (unfortunately) The Summit.

The Far West Children’s Health
Scheme held a very successful three-day
conference in Sydney during the week,
Mr. Norman Drummond being the
chairman and the official opening being
performed by the Hon. W. F. Sheahan.
Dr. W. J. Wearn and Dr. A. M. Barron
proposed the votes of thanks, and among
the delegates were Mr. and Mrs. R. W.
Bray (Broken Hill), Mr. and Mrs. Frank
Kingston (Orange) Mrs. A. E. Press,
M.L.C. (Condoblin), Mrs. E. A. Iceton
(Gunnedah) and Miss “Betty” Muzyczuk,
who has helped to raise so much money
for the Far West Children.
The Baby-heartbeat machine was men-
tioned by one of the guest-speakers at
the conference, Professor Bruce T.
Mayes, who said that hitherto the saving
of baby’s lives at birth had not kept
pace with the saving of mothers’ lives.
Very, very seldom was a mother’s life
lost these days in Australia, but not so
with babies. The Baby - heartbeat
machine, which enables the physician
to listen to the heartbeat right up to the
time of birth, is already in use in one
hospital in Sydney and it is hoped soon
to have two others. The first one cost
£6OOO and the others will cost £4OOO, so
some effort will certainly have to be put
into providing these means of saving the
lives of babies.

By the way, there’s a good deal of
reorganising to be done on account of
the fact that the Chevron Hotel will not
be finished until September. The Black
and White Ball committee’s very first
Chevron dinner-party has had to be post-
poned, and the Elizabethan Ball commit-
tee will also have to do a good deal of
rearranging. Really, it seems that these
things always happen in this day and
age. Whether you are building a little
cot or a huge block of home-units, you
never can be sure when it will be started,
let alone finished.
The International Ball Committee for
this year hgs been elected, with Mr. C.
R. McKerihan as president, with secre-
taries Mrs. Harris Thompson, Mrs. F.
Groth, Mrs. S. Lennon, Mrs. A. C.
Gooma, Mrs. P. W. E. Curtin to assist
him. The decor will be in the hands of
Miss Phyllis Shillito and the table-
decorations in charge of Mrs. Byram
Mansell and Mrs. Kay Williams.

A place to bring the kiddies (who all
seem to be mad on aeroplanes) is the
Bankstown Air Show to be held next
Sunday, May 29, at (naturally enough)
Bankstown. There will be craft to be
examined and demonstrations to be
watched, including a spectacular banner-
lifting display by three aircraft in close
formation, the first public display of this
aerobatic ; and, for the laughter-loving,
a stunt in which a policeman on a bicycle


tries to capture an old woman who has
stolen a plane. There is also to be a
flying-witch on a bicycle, though whether
it’s the same old lady is not disclosed.
MELBOURNE
As a compliment to his Scottish
ancestry, the Governor-General, Viscount
Dunrossil, who was accompanied by the
Viscountess Dunrossil, was piped into
the Town Hall by two Scots pipers at
the Commonwealth Day luncheon given
by the Royal Commonwealth Society.
Among the many guests were 60 repre-
sentatives of various parts of the British
Commonwealth, some wearing gay,
colorful saris. In the organ-loft the
Union Jack and the Australian flag
flanked the Queen’s portrait, and in front
of the official-table was a wide bank
of yellow and tawny chrysanthemums.
Flags of the Commonwealth were draped
from the balcony, and miniature silken
flags on silver standards were set on
every table. The honorary vice-president
of the Society, Sir John Latham, the
chairman, Mr. J. R. Kinsman, and the
senior vice-president, Mrs. Claude Couch-
man received the vice-regal party.
The petite Viscountess chose a brown
black-flecked tweed frock and dyed
ermine stole with a soft-beige toque edged
with mink. Mrs. Couchman wore a
lightweight black wool frock with a
raspberry-red cloche of melusine. Mrs.
Henry Bolte, who accompanied the
Premier, added to her tweed frock and
matching jacket in aqua-blue a head-
hugging cap in aqua and deep-marine
blue. Also in the official party were
Chief Justice Sir Edmund Herring and
Lady Herring, Lady Dixon, Brigadier
and Mrs. R. V. Tovell, Sir Kingsley and
Lady Norris, Sir Clifden and Lady Eager,
Mrs. Guy Bakewell, Mr. Bruce Mcßrien,

British Commonwealth Day was also
celebrated by members of the Young
Fellows Group of the R.C.S. and the
Younger Group of the Royal Overseas
League, who combined to hold a Loyal
Societies dinner-dance. Savories and
dinner were served at the clubrooms of
the Overseas Club in South Yarra and
then guests moved on to the rooms of
the Royal Commonwealth Society in
Queen’s Road for dessert and dancing.
More than 120 members and friends
were welcomed by Graham Menzies
(president of Y.F. Group) and Leonard
McQuade. Among those who dined
and danced were Pamela Middleton,
Betty Leslie, Adele Blandy, Primrose
Buchanan, Merna O'Sullivan, Pauline
Abrecht and Rosemary Dorman. Escorts
included David Menzies, Bruce Smith,
Glen Walmsley and Brian Morris.

a hot-house with plants and fountains
for the Glass House dinner-dance to aid
the Royal Children’s hospital. Over 200

all sorts of games to raise money for
this good cause. Lady Clarke is presi-
dent of the organising committee, with
Mrs. Norman Carlyon vice-president.
Country folk who will be in town for
the races are advised to book early. For

The Phillip Street Revue Co., from
Sydney, quickly got the first-night audi-
ence “in” at the Comedy Theatre with
the smoothness, wit and comedy of their
show and Melburnians certainly were
given opportunities to laugh at them-
selves. Even though the night was
bitterly cold, a capacity-audience
attended. Among them were Mrs.
Kenneth Nesbit, whose cerise silk-taffeta
stole was a vivid contrast to her black
frock ; Mrs. Frank Nichol, wearing an
emerald-green silk-taffeta theatre-coat;
Mrs. Roy Ricker, whose short, bouffant
frock was of lipstick-pink French-lace ;
Mr. and Mrs. Max Ham; Sir Arthur

of Queensland, happened to have be-
come associate-editor of the “London
Magazine” and had invited a few Aus-
tralian poets, mostly Queenslanders, to
contribute to one issue of his maga-
zine. The Guinness people will never
get a satisfactory Australian represen-
tation unless they decide they can
choose from Angus and Robertson’s
annual “Australian Poetry” (which is,
in fact, published in England as well
as in this country).
However, apart from all that, this
anthology is really very useful as a
way of keeping in touch with what is
being done in England and America,
which otherwise you can do only by
reading a wide variety of magazines—
and even then much of the year’s verse
would elude you.
What, for instance, has W. H. Auden
been doing lately? He has written an
admirable travel-poem about Italy.
Robert Graves? His strong, sinewy
Anglo-Saxon is still being used in full
vigor in “Call It a Good Marriage.”
Edwin Muir? He is very impressive
indeed on this age when “Respectable
men have witnessed terrible things.”
Robert Lowell over in Boston? He is
still able to make fine poetry out of
Ford cars. Edith Sitwell? She has
never been more ingenious or more
moving than in her lament for old age,
“La Bella Bona Roba,” where personal
feeling subdues and forces itself through
her eccentricities of manner:—
Where is my white velvet dress
Of flesh that some called heaven, some
sin—
Not pitying the grave that is
Not slaked, that is not satisfied,
For all its triumphs? Ah, lass, lost!
Alas, lost.
And then, what is new from Hillary
Corke, whose poem like a sea-adven-
ture of Kenneth Slessor’s one liked so
much in last year’s anthology? He
is still writing excellently, and still
oddly like Slessor, in “The Early
Drowned.” And what else is new?
Well, there are Allison Burnett,
Richard Eberhart, W. S. Merwin,
Robert Pack, Theodore Roethke and
Robert Penn Warren from the U.S.;
poets from Canada, one from Jamaica,
several from Ireland. There is a very
good poem about a suit of armor by
Fergus Allen, who was born in London
in 1921 ; there is a poem which begins
“Let us now praise prime numbers” (a
thought which has not previously
occurred in poetry); and so on; it is
full of new things.
But the best news in it is that, though
one does not care to generalise about
movements in poetry, the verse as a
whole seems to have become much
more humorous, human, comprehen-
sible and approachable than used to be
the case a few years ago. Whether this
is due to a principle of editing or to
some change of the wind, it certainly
makes for very acceptable reading.
D.S.
Hard Task
Ezra Pound’s Cantos, as was fore-
told, didn’t stop at a hundred. The
new book is called Thrones, Cantos
96-109 (Faber) in a new format, giving
up the old Bodoni for a type set at
the Valdonega press, Verona —which
doesn’t make it any more intelligible.
It is now a steady stream of Chinese,
Italian, American, French. Greek,
Latin, with occasional Chinese sym-
bols. Sez Ez: —-
If we never write anything save
what is already understood, the field
of understanding will never be ex-
tended. One demands the right, now
and again, to write for a few people
with special interests and whose
curiosity reaches into greater detail.
Similarly, in yet another book of
Wallace Stevens’s essays. The Neces-
sary Angel (Faber), which seems to
have been previously printed in
America during the author’s lifetime,
Stevens says in an introduction:—
A force capable of bringing about
fluctuations in reality in words free
from mysticism is a force independ-
ent of one’s desire to elevate it....
It has only to be presented . . .
Altogether, Stevens seems to succeed
better than Pound; you feel that if
you knew six or eight languages <md
studied the history books and bio-
graphies Pound relies on you might
understand what he is driving at; but
Stevens manages to mystify you com-
pletely in one language with words
which individually make sense but, put
together, are completely baffling.
This experience is limited, perhaps,
to the present reviewer; Edwin
Honig, in Dark Conceit, The Making
of Allegory (Faber) finds Wallace
Stevens so helpful he prefaces each of
his first four chapters with one of
Stevens’s poems, e.g.;—
There is a project for the sun. The
sun
Must bear no name, gold flourisher,
but be
In the difficulty of what it is to be.
Honig’s book is an effort to revive
interest in what he considers the de-
pressed market of the allegory, with
consideration of “The Faerie Queene,”
“Moby Dick.” the novels of Kafka,
“Gulliver’s Travels.” “The Scarlet
Letter,” etc., which leaves the present
reviewer with Coleridge’s objection,
disdainfully quoted:—
If the allegoric personage be
strongly individualised so as to
interest us, we cease to think of it
as an allegory ; and if it does not
interest us, it had better be away.
But the discussion of the books is »
interesting, particularly Honig’s analysis
of Kafka’s “Metamorphosis,” in which
the hero awakes to find he has grown
into a beetle because he has refused
to go to work and keep his family.
As to Stevens’s book, it is all lec-
tures given at Princeton and Harvard
Universities, essays on Marianne
Moore, the relation between poetry and
painting, etc., and a poem on a pine-
apple, illustrating some principle of
vision or criticism. His method, as one
understands it, is to agree with critics
that art, and especially poetry, should
be realistic, and then to go on to prove
that abstract poetry and abstract art
are more real than real (or what
abstractionists call naturalistic) poetry
and art. No one can counter such
casuistry except by ignoring it.

Australian Theatre
It was an excellent idea for
Cheshire’s to make a book— The
Making of Australian Theatre —out of
the three lectures Hugh Hunt gave
under the Kathleen Robinson grant at
Sydney University last October, for, as
well as explaining what Hunt tried to
do during his five years as executive
director of the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust, these lectures offer the sort of
clear-headed and practical advice that
will be valuable to Australian theatre-
makers for some time to come.
Their line of argument cannot be
restated too often. It starts, as every
approach to the subject should, by
recognising that the wide audience for
indigenous theatre in this country was
lost, one way and another, during the
’thirties and ’forties, and, since a
couple of generations have grown up
without developing the taste for that
experience which only first-rate living
theatre can give, “it will take time and
bitter experience and much money, as
well as hopeful enthusiasm” to win
this large audience back.
The effort must be made at many
levels, from the schools (where the
Scriven puppets and the Young Eliza-
bethan Players have already made a
start) through the universities to the
little-theatres and the commercial
theatres; but the most pressing need
is for a national theatre “to set a
standard of performance which can act
as a stimulus to other theatres.... offer
a permanent home for a representative
selection of classical plays” as well as
for “contemporary plays, especially
those of its own country.”
Hunt is quick to see that this leads
to something of a chicken-and-egg
situation. What comes first —the play-
wright or the theatre to perform his
work soundly? How can one begin to
develop without the other?
There is, of course, no sure way out
of this dilemma. Much depends on
unknown and unknowable factors,

“Caustic and convincing in satire” (Times Literary Supplement)
A DESCANT FOR GOSSIPS
by Thea Astley
“Its background, a small country town in Queensland, is brilliantly
drawn . . . this is a novel which deserves to be read.”

social and political as well as artistic.
The ideal solution would obviously be
the sort of spontaneous creative upsurge
that produced the Elizabethans and the
Abbey Theatre, and there is probably
no effective substitute for this. It can-
not, however, be made to measure.
Our national theatre can only create
a climate favorable to the growth of
whatever genuine movement appears
by training actors, producers, designers,
etc., in their craft (the National Insti-
tute of Dramatic Art will do much
good here) and providing them with the
continuous work on a variety of quality
plays that is essential to their develop-
ment.
If this approach is to succeed. Hunt
argues, managements must be bolder in
their choice of plays and production
methods. It is useless to chase popu-
lar taste:—
Those who... .believe in the dic-
tum of giving the public what it
wants rather than giving the public
what they believe is good have failed
sooner or later to satisfy the public’s
taste. Indeed, it would be true to say
that those who have made theatre
in the way they believed to be right,
in a way that suited their own taste,
have more often than not succeeded.
The drama is sick and the audience
lost because, Hunt believes, theatres
are more concerned with cutting costs
and safeguarding against failure than
with producing what they like as well
as it ought to be done. “This attitude.”
he says, “has limited our vision and
stunted the spirit of adventure without
which the magic of theatre cannot
work.”
Judging from his self-critical tone
here and in other parts of the book,
Hunt would probably be the first to
admit that the Trust itself has not
always been as bold as it should be.
(Where are the classics this year? And
where the Australian plays?) The
reason, however, is not far to seek,
though Hunt places very little insist-
ence on it. If you are going to under-
take a bold and comprehensive reper-
toire you obviously need money; and
the present financial grants which
the Australian theatre receives,
although generous by previous stan-
dards, are totally inadequate for any
theatre to undertake such a reper-
toire on a regular basis, and without
regularity of performance high stan-
dards are unachievable.
I estimate that it would require a
grant of a further £50,000 a year to
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust to
enable it to undertake such a reper-
toire in addition to its opera com-
mitments.
Here we are faced with what Hunt
regards as an inescapable fact: a
national theatre cannot do its job
properly and pay its own way, any
more than an art-gallery, a symphony-
orchestra or a public library can. Our
answer to the question whether the
Trust should have its £50,000 will de-
pend, then, on whether we value
theatre as much as we value the other
arts. Remembering what has been
achieved by such heavily subsidised
groups as the Old Vic, the Moscow
Art Theatre and the Comedie Fran-
caise, can there be any doubt about
the answer?
Hunt’s ideas about producing and
acting, though everywhere marked by
an intelligent devotion to his craft, are
less immediately important than his
remarks about playwriting, which seem
to go to the roots of the whole national-
theatre problem. Although he does not
dispute the value of naturalism, which
has lately dominated Australian drama,
he insists that, in general,
contemporary plays are... .passing
through a stage of “littleness.” The
themes are little, the action is little,
the dialogue is little, the staging is
little,.. .Under such circumstances,
can we wonder that their appeal is
little?
Now,' by the “littleness” of con-
temporary plays I do not only mean
the physical size of the play but the
range of its vision. I am appealing
for more universal themes, more
expansive horizons, a more imagina-
tive approach, and I believe that
only when contemporary plays shake
off the restrictive shackles of
“realism,” when they can again use
language, color and movement, will
they regain wide popularity.
These were the statements that got
most publicity, at any rate in Sydney,
at the time the lectures were given.
And rightly so ; for it is the play-
wrights who do most to decide the
course of a country’s theatre, and the
broad poetic expression Hunt calls for
is what lies at the heart of all the great
dramatic movements. This, surely, is
what the lost audience of Australia is
waiting for.

Reviewed Briefly
Comrade Venka: Pavel Nilin
(Hutchinson). Far from being the
“exciting, fast-moving, hard-hitting tale
of adventure” promised on the dust-
cover, “Comrade Venka” is a rather
gentle, slow-moving book which
appeals more by its simplicity and
naivete than by its vigor. Written in
Soviet Russia, its “goodies” are young
idealistic members of the 0.G.P.U.,
while the “baddies” are the counter-
revolutionary bandits who skulk in the
mountains. All the exciting action
happens off-stage, and the reader is
never given any clues as to why the
officers of the O.G.P.U. act as they do.
Yet there is an appeal in the descrip-
tions of the Siberian countryside and
some pathos in the aspirations of the
young detectives, together with humor
in their personal relationships.

The Hammering: Hal Martin
(Faber). An unusual, perceptive and
completely believable first-novel about
a British officer who missed action in
War II —he was transferred from the
infantry to an Indian transport-unit—
and finds himself caught-up in the drug-
peddling racket between Damascus
and Cairo. Whether describing the
unsavory efficiency of dope-smugglers,
the semi-comic existence of a patient
on the “danger-list” in a military hos-
pital, the devotion of sepoys on the
camp-staff, or the inner thoughts of
his frustrated and convalescent hero,
the author never goes astray.
