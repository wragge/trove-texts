The Red Page
Thou Shalt Not
Only one Moses in the competition for
a new Australian Decalogue hit upon the
flaw that makes the average Australian
annoyed with the ancient Decalogue. We
are not accustomed to be told thus curtly
and uncompromisingly that we shall or shall
not do any particular thing. In fact, to be
told not to do a thing is, for the Australian,
as for the unspoiled kid anywhere, the great-
est temptation to butt right in and do it —
just to see what happens. It usually does
too. The Decalogue suits the Huns: the
spend their whole lives shrinking from larg
“Verboten ” notices. Curious that they ar
the race that need the Moses Decalogue most.
But even “Keep off the Grass” arouses al
that is most Australian in us. Hence th
monotonous recurrence of “Thou shalts” anc
“Thou shalt nots” rather spoils the exeellen
made-in-Australia commandments submitted
The competitor who hit upon the formula
“You might as well” went, by merely tha
phrase, a long way toward the prize.
The number of mute, inglorious Mosese
in Australia is enormous. This is certainly
the most popular competition yet devised by
this page. Of course, Moses was severely
hampered by the necessity of inscribing each
letter upon stone. Naturally he had to
prune all redundant literary graces from his
phrases—a unique example of the influence
of matter over literary style. Anybody who
has seen an Australian tombstone employee
engraving, at union rates and union speed
the name of the dear departed will under
stand Moses’s Inclination to be brief and to
the point. But there is another reason why
those competitors who preferred length to
brevity had to be discouraged. Decalogues
must be brief. Remember, you had to
learn the old Ten Commandments when you
were young; and you may have children of
your own. Be merciful to them, as this page
means to be.
Several new commandments were men-
tioned by a majority of the competitors. On
counting the total votes received these com-
mandments would head the list, in something
like this order:—
1. Thou shalt not borrow.
2. Thou shalt not commit adulteration.
S. Thou shalt not toowse.
k. Thou shalt honor Australia.
5. Thou shalt not import.
Herewith some inspired commandments
that occurred in various otherwise prosy
decalogues:—
Cultivate a taste for self-sacrifice: you’l
need it.
Don’t have a god if you have no use for one
Thou shalt try a new god. Wealth has
had a long innings.
Honor thyself, for it was for their own
sakes only that thy father and thy mother
brought thee into the world.
Thou shalt be certain what adultery is;
then, don’t commit it.
—All these by A.E.P.
Thou shalt call no other country “Home”
but Australia.
—E. L. Lundstrom.
Thou shalt curse the pubs, the P.L.L. and
the Potsdam Pirate; and with a loud voice
shalt thou curse the Censor and the neces-
sity for the hospital at Milson’s Island; but
thou shalt remember that curses alone avail
not.
—Rupert Brown.
Thou shalt do the fair thing.
Thou shalt love all women and be faithful
to one.
—Q.E.D.
Thou shalt work.
Honor thy contracts and thy Courts of
Arbitration, that thy strikes may be unknown
in the land. '
—“Moses Wattleblum.”
Marry a good woman whilst thou art still
young, and bring not into the world more
children than thou canst well support
—Susan O.
Remember the heroes of Anzac and keep
their memory green.
—“D. Tease.”
Six days shalt thou “labor” and do all
manner of shirk, but the seventh thou shalt
keep wholly for pleasure.
Thou shalt not “scab.”
—Both by “Delver.”
Thou shalt not worship any fool image or
hero, but shalt reverence thy reason, respect
thy neighbor, esteem thy horse, and show
kindness to thy cattle pup.
Inwall thy stealings be mindful of the law.
Thou shalt do unto others as they would
do unto thee. And shalt do it first, whether
it be good or whether .it be evil, thereby
creating a hearty rbspeet for that which is
good.
—These three by H. G. James.
Thou shalt love thy town more than thy-
self and thy State more than thy town, and
Australia more than thy State. And thou
shalt also, but with more brain, love the
Empire. And to those who dislike this com-
mandment say: “Australia and I are two,
but the Empire is a crowd.”
—“Ah Gee.”
Never change the last pound note.
—J.R.D.
Thou shalt have no other goods from over-
sea.
Thou shalt not bow down thyself to
Cohen, nor serve him ; for lOU, his god, is
a jealous god, visiting the indebtedness of
the fathers upon the children even unto the
third generation of them that worship him,
and charging interest by the thousand to
them that curse him, yet keep his command-
ments.
Remember the eight-hours’ day and keep
it wholly. Eight hours shalt thou labor and
do all thy work, for the six-hours’ day is a
fond thing vainly imagined, whether by thee,
or thy son, or thy daughter, etc. For in not
less than eight hours mayst thou accomplish
thy duty to thyself and thy fellows; where-
fore has Australia blessed the eight-houra-
day and hallowed it
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s House,
for thou hast seven Houses of thine 0wn....
—This loquacious lot from Guy Innes.
You shall not sacrifice the kid, either by
preventing his arrival, leaving him to grow
anyhow, or borrowing moneys that he will
have to repay.
Cleave to your mate, your husband or
your wife with all your heart. Any love
remaining over shall be prudently and
cleanly used.
—O. N. G.
Thou shalt not use the word “Blanky.”
Give not overmuch cheek to thy parents.
They have piled up mountains of debts for
thee to pay, wherefore go slow, lest they
lump on more.
Thou shalt not allow thyself to be made
a co-re., unless thou canst afford it. Like-
wise, remember that the baby-bonus abol-
isheth not thine obligation to marry the girl.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife.
The most desirable-looking wives are gener-
aly take-downs, yet the red-headed woman
with freckles often makes the best wife.
And, anyhow, there are stacks of women.
—This instalment from F.C.
Thou shalt have a wife.
Thou shalt not let any water run to
waste, for it is a dry country.
Thou shalt not kill for sport.
—Henry Smith.
Thou shalt not commit adultery, nor form
illicit unions; with peace shall come a
revision of the law.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s coun-
try until to thy neighbor thou canst effectu-
ally say, “Keep off the grass”; thou shalt
not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor wilt thou,
after thou hast become thoroughly acquainted
with her.
: —L. Woolacott.
I am thy Parliament, which hath made
of thee a nation, which hath brought thee
out of the houses of bondage, even the 12
Houses of the six States. Thou shalt have
no other Parliament before me.
—H. Stewart.
Thou shalt take the name of the Capital-
ist in vain, for the Union shall hold him
guilty who speaketh well of the Boss.
—R. Nought X.
We are blanky Australians, and don’t
forget it.
Thou shalt, in all cases of doubt, danger
or embarrassment, grin and carry on.
Thou shalt not speak disparagingly of the
good, kind censor. He knows what is best
for us.
—Pontius Potter.
Thou shalt not take Australia’s name in
the stinking-fish vein; for Good Australians
w tJ., not hold him Shitless that doeth this.
Thou shalt not bear false witness... .ex-
cept to save a woman from dishonor.
—L. Sparrow.
Don’t skite.
Take full interest and pride in things Aus-
tralian—also in the big things outside Aus-
tralia.
—May Siede.
Thou shalt get work.
Thou shalt not pawn the kid.
Thou shalt honor thy word, and build me
a railway to—not from—my Northern Terri-
tory in the shortest possible time, and by
the shortest possible route.
—“Ben Sun.”
Thou shalt choose to be born in great
numbers.
—“Moses Junior.”
Thou shalt, in the end, die game.
—O.T.G.
Whatever thy religion or irreligion, respect
it.
—Teresa Teece.
Thou shalt read The Bulletin.
Thou shalt not express thy patriotism in
verse, but in cash, lest the people curse
thee.
—Freda Oldman.
Thou shalt not starve.
—“My Oath.”
Quite a number of private or sectional
decalogues were submitted. H. B. Yencken
supplies The Trades Hall Decalogue, of
which the best commandments are:—
The Trades Hall spake these words and said:
Thou shalt have none other Gods but Me.
Thou shalt not take for thyself any kind of non-
union labor, or too much of it, that is in Heaven
above, the earth beneath, nor the wateni under the
earth; for I, thy Union, am a jealous Union, and
weit the Bins of the fathers upon the children of
them that hate me, and take the wages of thousands
of them that loathe me but keep my commandments.
Kemember thou keep sober the Sabbath day. Six
days shalt thou drink all thou art able to, but the
seventh is the Bartenders’ Holiday. In It thou shalt
buy no manner of intoxicants, thou, thy son, thy
daughter, thy manservabt, thy maidservant, thy
cattle, and the stranger that is within thy bar.
And the Union Secretary also spake these
words, submitted by Erie Cox, saying:—
Thou shalt not be a blackleg.
Thou shalt not possess thine own soul, neither shalt
thou make up thine own mind on any matter under
Heaven or earth save only as I direct. For I thy
Boss, am a jealous Joss, and will deal it out to thee
and thine even to starvation shouldst tliou forsake
me, and find fat billets for such of ye as are truly
humble and vote according to my word.
Thou shalt boost Australian manufactures such
only as are not “black.”
Remember the Sabbath Day, and get thy beer on
Saturday night. Forty-eight hours a week shalt thou
labor, and in that time do as little as possible, and
for the rest draw time and a half. But on the Sab-
bath Day draw double time,, and if thy Boss will
not cough up according to the word of Higgins, get
thee to Bondi, thou and thy missus and thy kids
and thy cobber which is next door. Even the Lord
would not labor on the seventh day.
Thou shalt know more than thy father and thy
mother put together that thy days may be long on
the land which thine old pot worked for.
Thou shalt vote against conscription, for thy Union
must come before thy country.
Love ye one another, but do it discreetly.
Thou shalt not steal, but this clause applies only
to capitalists and employers. Politicians and Unions
are specially exempt, and for them the Public purse
is ever open, for the Public is a Monumental Ass.
Thou shalt not pause to utter any slander against
the other side, for be sure they will do likewise
unto thine.
Thou need not covet anything on earth, be thou
wowser or bung or unionist or any other darned
thing, for if thou canst not get thy desire honestly,
grab it by Act of Parliament and call it lawful.
While “Janet” whispereth these councils
to the Flapper, tittering:—
Be happy. The doctrine of Eternal Punishment is
out of date, anyhow.
If you can’t be pretty, be chic.
Make the most of yourself. Disdain not aids to
beauty. Many a proposal has withered in the shine
of a sun-kissed nose, and many men like the taste of
lip-salve.
Respect your elders—youth is evanescent.
Cultivate a charming inanity. There are few men
brainy enough to stand cleverness in a wife.
Mind your own business. The other cat says just
the same things about you.
Be innocent. Men prefer it—in their wives.
Covet not the other girl’s man. A fickle fiancfi
makes a constant co-respondent.
Marry an orphan. Relations-ii>law are the limit.
Be a bromide. Most of us are, and it is far less
trouble.
Broken Bill taketh his pipe from his
mouth and yarneth:—
Qit work—thet iz, if y’r carn’t git ennything else.
Don’t b’ a scab, because there is no ointment t’ be
got f’r shaded legs.
Stoush y’r neighbor if ’e narks y’r, also th’ John
if ’e ’orns inter th’ scrimmage.
Shicker in spite ov blanky referendums, ’n’ fergit
not th’ bloke who shouted in th’ days ov thy stiffness.
Remember th’ boss giveth ’n’ th’ boss taketh away
—y’r daily toil.
Don’t pinch ennything ’n’ git found out —’tis
cheaper t’ buy or borrow it.
Consider Sundee ’n’ loaf well, because Mundee
means git set again f’r th’ next round.
Save a life when y’r git a charnce. Huns do the
other thing.
Don’t yap erbout Old Hughie too much, but, if y’r
carn’t ’elp it, gor’ blime iz right enuff now ’n’ again.
Look arfter th’ old chap ’n’ muther, f’r they wuz
dinkum t’ y’r before y’r block ’n’ muscle got strong.
While N. Freeberg boosteth Australia,
blankying:—
Boost Orstralyer.
Boost the country like ’ell.
Strike me fat, we can prodooce the goods,
then w’y not well boost some more!
Ain’t our lump o’ dirt the freest and best in the
world? Well, roust yer selves and boost
like a sweatin’ of a football barracker.
D’yer need t’ be told that there ain’t no

Don’t ferget to boost the place. Boost it fer
all yer worth; spend yer last tray and breave
yer last* breff fer good old —- Orstralyer.
A Buchan catcheth the eye of the
Speaker, saying:—
Thou shalt have no other gods before the Caucus.
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image,
etc., excepting Brooklyn Bridge and the Twopenny
Tube.
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God
in vain without first referring to the Trades Hall.
Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, even
though the hotels do close at 6 o’clock on Saturday
night.
Honor thy father and thy mother, and get as much
out of them while living, remembering probate dues
to come.
Thou shalt not kill, nor issue too much paper
money, as it amounts to the same thing.
Thou shalt not commit adultery, until a Bill of
sanction is passed by both Houses.
Thou shalt not steal—just keep on borrowing.
Thou shalt not bear false witness, etc., for con-
scientious reasons even though it may get through a
Royal Commission.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, etc.
Just monopolise them in the name of the State.
&
In judging the final 13 decalogues left in
after sifting the hundreds submitted, several
considerations ruled. First, length. A
number were thrown out awing to extreme
loquacity. The shortest was submitted by
“Peggy”:—
Thou shalt (1) love , (2) know, (8)
oclieve in, v (If) advance the interests of,
(5) speak the praises of, (6) inscribe the
beauties of, (7) read the books of, (8) work
for, (9) live for, (10) die for Australia.
B. J. H. Owen’s lot could have been In-
scribed on one tijißlet. It, and the other
decalogues here Honorably mentioned, will
appear subsequently on this page. Another
consideration is that of casting the new
commandments in the mold of the old, thus
making the Australian Decalogue more easy
to remember. “Ma’feesh” and “Moses
Junior” come very close to the literary form
invented by Moses, sen.; but their con-
tents are not particularly striking. Excel-
lent decalogues, with some weak command-
ments, are inscribed by “Australian Cadet”
and J.D.C., while R.S. cleverly rimes the
old ten with modern improvements.
The remaining six have in common
necessary quality: they are Australian a !
it was Australian commandments that
expressly asked for. One weak ™l! e e
ment deprives “Apostle W. M v'

The Ansae Book (Cassell, 3s. 6d. out
here), written and illustrated in Gallipoli
by the men of Anzac, for the benefits of
Anzac funds, is a souvenir of The Great
Adventure that will be treasured by every
patriotic Australasian. The book was pro-
duced in the lines at Anzac toward the end
of 1915. Practically all the stuff in it was
composed in the trench or in the dug-ont
in the danger zone. The book was to have
been a New Tear Magazine, published at
Anzac; but the news of the unexpected
evacuation delayed publication, and ulti-
mately it appeared in London. The Ansae
Book is the first and the last book produced
in Gallipoli. The artistic contents reach an
astonishingly high level of excellence, despite
the fact that the artists had to work with
such materials as iodine brushes, red and
blue pencils, and paper that was not always
white. The artist who has made an Anza-
cian reputation is David Barker. His color
work is remarkably good.
The letterpress has the cheerful, don’t-
care-a-damn Anzacian humor; and there
must have been almost as many poets as
there were fighters at Gallipoli.
Incidentally General Birdwood settles the
question of the origin of the word “Anzac.”
It will come as news to most readers to
hear that it was invented in Egypt. “When
I took over the command of the Australian
and New Zealand Army Corps in Egypt a
year ago,” writes General Birdwood, “I was
asked to select a telegraphic code address
for my Army Corps, and then adopted the
word ‘Anzac.’ Later on, when we had
effected our landing here, I was asked by
General Headquarters to suggest a name for
the beach where we had made good our first
precarious footing, and then asked that this
might be recorded as ‘Anzac Cove’ —a name
which the bravery of our men has now
made historical, while it will remain a geo-
graphical landmark for all time.” That
seems to dispose of the other usually
accepted explanation that “Anzac” was inj
vented at Gallipoli by a certain signallers
corps.
f
Arthur H. Adams writes: I was sur-
prised to find in The Ansae Hook, on page
104, that some verse entitled “The Trojan
War, 1915,” and published over my name
in The Bulletin, was printed, word
for word and with the same title, as
having been written by J. Wareham, Ist
Aust. Field Amb. Well, if J. Wareham
wants the copyright of my verses be is wel-
come to them. Anybody who fought at
Anzac has more right to them than, the
author, who didn’t. In fact, it is a highly
appreciated compliment that J. Wareham
selected the verses and that the editors
thought them good enough to appear in that
brilliant record of Australianism. Tbats
good enough for me.

Respite.
A sun-bright day, when bent the silv’ry
trees
Before a dawdling wind, that sway’d their
cool
Leaves laughingly, until they twinkled green
And glistening as the ripples o’er the bay !
Upon the topmost bough the pine tree
reared
A blackbird sang. And in the shimmering
Of gum-tree boughs, black cassock’d magpies
shook
Their dusky feathers, chimed their mellow
notes.
No. traffic’s turmoil rose upon the air.
This day of rest was as a cool, strong palm
Laid on the throbbing brow of fevered Life.
A golden evening followed, trailing slow
Her garments, opal-hued, along the sky
Where, altar-like, poised high the crescent
moon.
The shaven grass sprang cool beneath our
tread.
While garden scents made dear and inti-
mate
Our quiet thoughts. No need was there of
words;
Lor understanding silence makes no call
On the interpreter. The world around,
Iveyed to that vibrant chord from muted
strings,
Was girt as we to meet the tides of life
E’er tragic Morrow, waking, stirred the
clouds
That had beguiled and hid it from our sight.
Spirit of this glad sun-warmed day, when
sleep
And darkness, in similitude of death,
Shall fold us, lead us on through aisles of
dreams
To view the cloistered goal where dreams
come true!

A Silver Birch.
The silver birch upon the wintry hill
Stands like a white witch-maid.
Clear where the moon has found her with
its light,
Unheeding of the vagrant winds of night,
Mysterious and cold.
As spring’s blithe heralds blew their elfin
pipes
She woke to deftly robe
Her slender limbs in budlets, soft and
green,
And wove herself a pale, translucent screen
Of flakes of emerald.
Beneath her bending boughs the murmurous
bees
Plundered the summer’s store;
Each roving wind caressed her tenderly,
And bore afar some strains of melody,
Caught from her lovers’ lutes.
When autumn bent the ripened grain she
wore
A cloak of trembling gold;
Briefly, for in sweet waywardness of mood
She cast her golden cloak away, and stood
In silver nakedness.
I know not when she is most fair to see,
This lady mutable;
Ever she sways, a slender, sylphid thing,
While soft wind-song and wildbirds’ carol-
ling !
Proclaim her meed ,of praise.

The Barmy Bo’sun.
I am the Barmy Bo’sun. ’Ere I stay
Watchin’ the tangled riggin’ of th’ trees
An’ thinkin’ this asylum Is a bay
And all th’ little ’illocks rollin’ seas.
They tole me I was barmy all the way
From Bonies Aires! I fought th’ flamin’
lot
An’ showed ’em I was just as sane as they !
An’ now they’ve gooe an’ left me ’ere to
rot! ’
“You prove I’m barmy an’ I’ll damn well go
Over th’ side an’ never sail no more!”
That broke ’em up! They laughed “IIoo-
hoo! 110-ho!
You’re goin’ straight in when we gets you
ashore!” Ht’A-
I never b’lieved ’em till th’ Weedin’ night
Th’ Ole Man served out rum an’ John
Bee kaid,
Shovin’ ’is Tot aside an’ full o’ fight,
“Blarst all yer rum! Warrer for me
instead !”'
/
I tremblin’ like a bleedin’ child.
I ses, “John Bee! Are you teetotal now?”
You never see a sailor man so wild!
’E knocked me down and yells, “You
blanky cow!”
I think ’e must ha’ give me sev’ral kicks;
I ’eard, far orf an’ dim, a stinkin’ row,
An’ ole John damnin’ all th’ loonatics
An’ roarin’ curses on “a lyin’ cow.”
I krwo then I was mad as mad could be!
I never fought no more—and then they
come
To joke an’ say, “Th’ poor ole beggar! ’e
Thought ole John Bee was done with
drinkin’ rum !”
An’ when th’ ship paid orf they brought me
’ere.
An’ ole John shook me fist. “Farewell,”
says ’e,
“Drift on, shipmate, an’ don’t y’ try ter steer,
An’ I’ll forgive th’ thing y’ said o’ me.”
So ’ere I sit with ’ands upon me knees,
Th’ wind among the riggin’ singin’ soft,
A-sailin’ this asylum through green trees—
Th’ maddest man that eVer went aloft.

a couple of elements which in the experi-
ments of the ages were to produce some
astounding chemical reactions. Behind
Hengist came shipload after shipload of
Jutes, Saxons, Angles and Danes; and as
the evil-smelling shields of the piratical
hordes pressed inland, England began to
take shape and form. Crude Saxon his-
tory seems to suggest that the invaders
entirely slaughtered the original British
population; but there is decent proof that
they did nothing so hurtful. What really
happened was a race-blending in which the
savage Teuton from overseas, conquering
the semi-civilised Briton, brought him down
to his own level, married his sister and
passed on a blend of thought, feeling and
instinct to future generations. The so-
called Anglo-Saxon was really an Anglo-Celt,
as is shown by the shape of his .head, the
contour of his mind and, to some extent, by
the variegation of his whiskers. This was
the sub-structure of the nation ; but as time
went on other elements were added. The
Norman Conquest brought in a fine crowd of
brigands of almost every race to be found
at the handy end of Europe. The habit
which oppressed foreigners have had of look-
ing for an asylum in a country that was less
prone to homicidal insanity than their own
added to the blend from age to age. Jews,
Flemings, French, Huguenots and others
came in tens of thousands and mingled with
the island race; and later on a tremendous
peaceful invasion of the modern Piets and
Scots set in from the North and West. The
result is the English people—the paradox
among nations.
The man who claims that England has
done the finest things accomplished by any
nation is not a liar. The _ian who declares
that England has first and last been the
most unimaginative country in the world
may be equally truthful. The person who,
with his eye glued on certain events in the
European record, asserts that England
possesses matchless courage, faith and forti-
tude is speaking no idle thing. The cynic
who with a scoff assures us that the English
are the most ridiculous of peoples is neither
fool nor knave. The race-blend that Hen-
gist originated is all these things and a
great many more. There is scarcely an end
to the English paradox. The English people
are high-minded, enthusiastic, dull, keen,
sensitive, unemotional, efficient, slipshod,
steadfast. uncertain. courageous, . easily
stricken by panic, just, bitterly prejudiced,
patriotic, unsentimental, proud, meek, silent,
talkative, phlegmatic, vivacious, headstrong,
calculating, incorruptible, mercenary and 50
other things all at once. There never was
a nation so easily moved to a sort of
hysteria nor a nation that so completely
kept its head in time of crisis. There never
was a nation that expressed such contempt
for its leaders and yet backed those leaders
so solidly in all that they might attempt
or do. There never was a nation more
prone to eat soup with a fork, nor one that
had a better appreciation of the value of a
spoon. In a word, all history has no record
of muddle at all comparable with the Eng-
lish muddle, and no record of the achieve-
ment of the impossible that will stand beside
that of the English race. From England
have sprung the finest impulses that have
moved mankind, yet those impulses sel-
dom moved England. The Englishman has
gone forth to the ends of the earth and
exhibited himself as hero, clod, saint and
charlatan all rolled into one. He is loved,
feared and hated. The world looks to him
for wisdom and jests at his -folly. His
self-sacrifice is stupendous, his greed invin-
cible ; his vanity over-reaches all bounds,
and modesty is one of the keynotes of his
life. It all goes back to Hengist; for the
Englishman is the stolid Teuton, in an insu-
lar environment, with the Celt in his blood
forever trying to break through the outer
husk, but restrained, modified and kept in
its place by the Saxon weight and bulk that
surrounds it.
* * * *
In the storms of the past English . gales
blew strangely. The Puritan revolution of
the seventeenth century—a revolution in
which the great bulk of the people were only
remotely interested —made way for all other
revolutions, but died quietly in the sordid
return of Charles 11. to the throne. Eng-
lishmen in the coldest of cold blood, with
judicial thoroughness and a sense of im-
mense responsibility, cut off a king’s head;
then they brought back their kings, nursed
them, tamed them, revered them and clung
to the notion of monarchy when others to
whom they had first set the example of
republicanism had done with royalty for-
ever. Always there was the same impati-
ence of control in the hearts of Englishmen
as that which moved the French and Irish ;
but the Englishman was the easiest of all
men to govern, and in a kind of explosive
patience he waited for the slow reform
which gave him half what he asked for and
left him in a fury of restrained discontent.
He could pull down the railings of Hyde
Park to be allowed free speech on a public
question; but he would use no violence to-
wards the men in Parliament who delayed
the serious discussion of that question. His
outlook on the world was strangely insular or
even parochial. He hated Napoleon and
Nicholas I. as tyrants, but endured the
more intimate tyranny of the squire and
parson without serious protest. In time of
war sparks of fierce patriotism blazed up in
him and, through all confusion of purpose,
ignorance and blundering, he backed his
leaders until they pushed things to a suc-
cessful finish. He hated war and shouted
approval to Quaker whiskers wagging in
the cause of peace; yet, when that peace
was ruptured, he would put his cash and
labor into the ensuing discord as if war
were the supreme joy of his existence. First
and last, he was the surprise-packet of
Europe; but he thought himself the straight-
est goer of all and wondered when French-
men bitterly railed at “Perfidious Albion.”
The bulldog idea and the notion that Eng-
land’s strength lay in her holding-on power
which gradually grew up in the universal
mind was only partly true. It was the
quick, sudden flash of unexpected Celtic
imagination and Celtic valor, followed by
the stubborn, weighty Saxon determination,
that gave England so remarkable a place
in history; and it was the failure of this
erratic compound to explode at the right
time which once or twice dragged her down
in shame and humiliation.
* * * *
To speak of England’s national ideals is to
waste breath. Idealism exists in England to
a greater extent than in most countries; but
national ideals there are none. The sub-
conscious thought that makes Germans speak
of the fatherland and Englishmen of the
mother country is correct. The sex of Eng-
land, as a nation, is female. She makes up
for the absence of national ideals by strong
national instincts. She does not reason; she
feels. When, as in the case of the venerated
doctrine of Cobden, she attempts to arrive
at conclusions by logical argument, she throws
all the misguided enthusiasm into the busi-
ness of a washer] ady with convictions on the
question of eternal punishment. If the washer-
lady would give her instinct a chance it
would guide her into happier places; hut she
has been reasoning things out, and the dis-
aster of her thought becomes her fetich in
perpetuity. Because in periods of crisis there
is little time to apply feminine reason to the
state of affairs, England is generally on the
right side in a big turmoil; and once she has
taken her side, nothing known on this planet
has force enough to shift her or to make her
doubt that hers is the cause of God and
humanity. Somewhere, too, in the woman-
heart of the nation is a big tenderness for
those who are sic-k or hungry, for those out-
casts among peoples who lack something
which she deems might make them happier.
This is why she runs so much to missionary
societies, and why her ample shawl is flung
over the distant and sweltering nigger to the
partial neglect of some of her frozen children
at home. She who nursed Freedom on her
knee and spanked it into disciplined obedi-
ence to precedent and custom still feels some-
thing of a motherly thrill when the name of
the infant is mentioned.
* * * *
In the tremendous world-war that now
begins to look healthy through its agonies,
England at last seems like taking her true
place. The millions on the French front, the
steel wall of the blockade, the busy munition
factories, and the enormous war-credits which
leave something over to hand to needy Allies
are lively signs that the nation has once
more broken the husk of muddle, and stands
as a leader among the world-powers which
move on to victory. That victory seems now
to be fairly well assured, though it will still
take time to bring the German to a state of
complete repentance. But when the war is
over, England steps out into a new place, and
must face q. fntute different from any of
which the nation could have dreamed. No
lohger is England in any real sense an island
Rower. War invention has straitened the
narrow seas until they are of little more con-
sequence than the castle moat or the ditch
about a Roman castra. Henceforth England
is a continental nation, moving to the im-
pulses of other lands and touched by the
spirit of alien peoples. The test of peace
will be a bigger one than the test of war. A
re-adjustment of all old things will be neces-
sary ; a revolution within her own borders is
certain That revolution will probably be a
peaceful one; but it will be something larger
in its sweep and deeper in its purpose than
any movement that has yet shaken the Anglo-
Celtic world. Australia, with the perspective
gained bv looking over half the world, takes
stock of these things with some emotion. We
have our own work to do, our own place to
fill in the scheme of things; but we should be
dull indeed if so great an event as the re-
making of England left us cold. Under all
the folly, wisdom, cant, sincerity, boastful-
ness and heroism of that parent nation there
lies something of strength and truth and
reality which her sons must admire. The old
order changes; and the day when the
cannons cool may be bigger for Eng-
land than that on which Hengist drove his
viking prow to Thanet. After all, of the old
world’s peoples England still holds the largest
possibilities.
HOW ABOUT “THE VOICE OF THE
PEOPLE” GETTING A FEW WORDS
IN?
Of course, the referendum already has a
place in the machinery of government in
Australia. Only by its use can change be
made in the Commonwealth Constitution.
The numerous Parliaments may bring the
referendum into operation as part of the law-
incubating process. One of them did it the
other day in connection with the N. S. Wales
Pub Closing Bill, when a bewildered Minis-
try was looking round for a method of saving
its face. But this clumsy limitation on the
referendum is of little use to the people. Its
legitimate place in the scheme of things is not
that of an instrument to be employed only by
the grace of politicians who happen to tumble
into a hole or to be terrified by doubts about
the way the cat is going to jump. Used in
that uncertain way by flustered balancers on
the rail of expediency, it may easily become
a source of abject political demoralisation,
making Party Government an even more
unclean thing than it is. To a democracy
the referendum must be something the elec-
tors can get hold of. Without it they are
almost powerless so far as popular govern-
ment goes —mere clay in the hands of adven-
turous potters, moulding what they call the
popular will into any distortion of the origi-
nal that the circumstances of a moment
may suggest. When and how and through
whom are the people of Australia going to
see the referendum made a genuinely work-
ing part of the machine? Labor has a plank
in its platform bearing this label. Labor has
been prodigal of promises on the subject.
But Labor in Parliament with a majority is
something very different from Labor battling
to get there. -Labor politicians have system-
atically side-tracked this pledge. Why ?
The answer is easy. Because the politician,
of every brand in every country, has shrunk
from yielding any of the powers of patron-
age within his grasp. The referendum-initia-
tive -would tear many of them away, make the
politician the servant of the people in a
sense that was real, and thus end the
anomaly of a democracy suppliant at the
doors of Parliament. The greatest of all
Parliaments is the Parliament of the People.
Thf, Bulletin wants to see it called into
session, its deliberations systematised. Hur-
riedly whistling it up once in a bine moon is
not the ideal. And the march of events in
Australia, where the landscape is getting
cumbered with political confusion, where the
allegedly National Government skulks in
obscurity and various other Governments are
playing the mischief generally, makes it more
necessary than ever it was that this Parlia-
ment should take a hand in the game. For
many years a host of loud talkers have been
running round yelling that they want to do
something or other “for the people” because
they have a mandate to that effect. What
this paper, with a profound distrust of the
“mandates” flung from the hurly-burly of a
general election, wants to see is the people
given a chance to consult the menu for them-
selves, and if they object to being served
with hash to say so.
* * * #
The Bulletin is not nursing any fan-
tastic notions about the referendum being
The Great Democratic Pill —a universal cure-
all for every social and economic evil. Nor
is this paper filled with a large, full-bodied
faith that the. referendum, if brought into
regular operation, would not lead to some
queer results. It certainly would. But that
is no argument against a political system.
If it were, the outfit the democracy is work-
ing with now would have been blown out
long ago. Anyhow, the results of not having
the referendum are sufficiently queer to be
done without in the future. That it could be
ridden to death, and that its adoption is not
without difficulty are admitted. Applied at
once to the whole field of legislation by seven
Legislatures it would become a nuisance.
There are some Bills submitted to Parlia-
ment which it would be farcical to submit
to a referendum, their bulk and complexity
being such as to make it ridiculous that they
should go holus bolus to the constituencies for
an a^ e /; in ? “ Yes f ” “No.” To submit a
Tariff Bill, tor instance, to the popular V nte
would be silly; to submit it item by item
wildly insane. A complicated Pensions Bill
or a Railways Authorisation Bill cou
hardly come within the scope of a referent
to the ballot. In such measures as th
principle and detail are so bound up that the
question on which the vote would hinge could
not be determined. But these consideration*
of difficulty do not touch the point at issiJ
They are difficulties which in any case Zo
overcome by the public having* authority
through the referendum to call upon Parlin
merit to resign. On the other hand Bills

tary Service, Preference of Employment to
Unionists, Abolition of the Leg.' Council
Amendment of the Electoral System in -mv
given direction, the Extinction of Cocked
Ilats, the Control of Hospitals, the Political
Rights of Women, and so on, could appro
priately be made subjects of reference to the
public. They affect the public in a particu
larly intimate way. Their points are clear
To deny the public the right to consultation
about them is a denial of democratic faith
With a widening of the functions of the State
and increasing political intelligence in the
people, the growth and power of extra-
parliamentary institutions and the accumu-
lating influence of the wire-pull, the exten-
sion of popular control over Parliamentar-
ians and their work grows steadily more im-
perative. Parliaments in Australia are not
under control of the people except so far as
the electors can at long intervals apply the
axe to the Ins or Outs. That looks a poor
substitute for the real thing. And the fruits
of it are rotten.
* * * *
Men who call themselves democrats and
yet dodge the democracy’s claim to self-gov-
ernment are shams, afraid of their own medi-
cine. Men who argue that the democracy
will make grave mistakes and run amok and
commit hari-kari merely say what can be said
about every form of government. Who have
made more appalling mistakes than despots?
What greater messes have been perpetrated
than those committed by Parliaments un-
accountable to the mass of the people whose
lives and liberties they juggled with? If
there is anything in the theory of Democracy,
if popular government is ever going to be
given a chance, if men and women are to
govern themselves instead of being governed
by superior persons, windbags, time-serving
flatterers or scheming reactionaries, then the
theory has to be pushed on to a plane where it
can be tested by trial. If the Australian
people have been bound in any direction it is
towards the creation of a Democracy. But
the goal is never going to be reached by sit-
ting contentedly down on the way, fumbling
at the problems of democracy with blunt tools
and nerveless hands, and only getting up to
dance to the tunes of irresponsible adven-
turers. No one contemplating the political
history of Australia can at this stage seri-
ously contend that if the referendum had
been in operation the position of the country,
socially and economically, would not have
been more creditable, the nation’s industries
more stable, and government more enlight-
ened than it is to-day. The opposite argument
cannot come even from the mouths of those
people whose mission in life it has been to
obstruct the extension of popular govern-
ment. Their complaint all along has been
that the public will was being outraged.
What force, then, would there be in an objec-
tion from them against the public will being
expressed in some more coherent way than
by the riot and uproar of general elections—
those often degrading orgies of abuse and lies
and travesties on the settlement of public
policy? Is government by yell and howl, by
handing out doles and soothing-syrups in
anticipation of the next yell, by walking
tight-ropes and clamoring at the pawnshop
preferable to government directly through the
people? This paper knows of only one
answer. It believes that the majority of the
people know of only one. And it hopes that
patriotic Australians will begin to demand
where the politicians are on this subject and
refuse to be fobbed off by a passionate under-
taking in the name of Democratic Progress
to supply something or other at a ha’penny
a pound cheaper.
TRAINING A SOLDIER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I once saw a representation of a troopship
in a melodrama. The men,'gowned to perfec-
tion, stood about in taking attitudes, bearing
rifles and swords; some leaned over the side
and drew each other’s attention to enemy
ships; others sat about polishing weapons
and pipe-claying belts. Oflicers clad in the
panoply of war passed to and fro. All
hands saluted, presented arms, brought their
swords to the recover, and in other respects
made the scene glorious. I believed it all
before I took to soldiering.
We parade after breakfast. The wear is
what our sergeant terms “blueys and white
’ats.” Smith is found to be absent. A cry
goes up for him. People howl “Smith down
companion-ways. In a dishevelled and panic-
stricken condition Smith appears —four am
a half minutes late. His superiors view him
with loathing. He is reminded of his past,
of his habit of leaning against railings; o
the fact that he appeared on parade with hm
coat-collar undone some days previously, a
of an occasion when he had to be told to ge
his hair cut. A shameful end is predicted to
him. . fW
A sensation is caused by the discovery t <
Brown has not shaved. He puts forwarc ■

that by it the fame of his troop, aye> or

A diversion is occasioned by the Did ,•
Captain shouting menacingly for the (Jr •
Trumpeter, who has sounded tne

Orderly-Trumpeter is an absurd lad, wk ,
all day in a remote part of the deck)
his instrument festooned about his ne •
garishly-colored cords, and practises
in a low key. Harmless, and very earnest, as


most musicians are. It is easy to see that
lie hns measured the enormity of his offence.
]lis rabbit-like eyes wear a hunted look.
Orderly-Officer: “Trumpeter, what is the
meaning of this What, I ask you,
is the meaning of it? Your orders are to
blow your bugle at five minutes to nine; you
blow it at seven minutes to nine. Two
minutes early! Don’t salute, sir! I say
stop saluting! Stand properly at attention
and don’t move. Never mind about the ship
rolling. Don’t move, and be silent! ’Ten-
shun! Stand steady there. Have you not
the ship’s clock to take your time by? Is it
not there for all to see? Stop moving your
mouth about instantly. Do you realise the
seriousness of your conduct? And why
haven’t you got your jacket on, sir? Gone
to be washed, eh!” (Bitterly) “It’s always
being washed. Always! You never wear it.
I saw you the day before yesterday sitting
without it up there on the monkey-deck,
where, in any case, you are strictly forbidden
to go. What do you mean by it? llow do
von expect to end? Orderly-Sergeant, see
that this boy gets his jacket on, and let me
have no more nonsense with him.”
The rebuke public is mostly along these
lines. Our officers are not, on the whole, an
articulate lot. They have a weakness for
the repetitive method. It has been fairly
successful up to now, but I question some-
times whether it will stand the wear and tear
of the months to come. And yet—l am not
sure. The uniform has a marvellous potency.
It is more than an emblem of power: its in-
fluence is spiritual.
Apply it to my case. I am in the ranks.
In private life I held a good position in my
profession. In the struggle for success, as
the world understands it, I am ahead of my
captain. In the interests of good order and
discipline, the thousands of private soldiers
who might be inclined to question the superi-
ority of their superiors need to be brought
into line. The methods under which one
chafes at first are those which mankind, after
thousands of years of practically ceaseless
warfare, has decided to be the best. The
scheme is very simple and very human. The
end desired is that the soldier shall regard
his officer —anv officer-i—as infallible or there-
abouts. If the spell fails to work the officer
is not fit for his job. In the first place there
is the sartorial element, which as every
priest, parson and barrister knows, is a most
effective hypnotiser. It is hard to feel
really captain of one’s soul in blue dungarees
that "fit nowhere, a rag hat that has not been
washed for days, and bare feet. Only the ex-
ceptional man can preserve his dignity when
deprived of his boots. The soldier wears the
dungarees; the officer a uniform in which
most men look their best. When, in addition,
the officer is authorised to order his
men to their amusements and their
devotions as well as to their labors; to scru-
tinise their every meal in detail and provide
advice on the subject—-when, in fact, he is
in a position to behave as though he knew
it all, and the able-bodied adults under him
were the victims of some form of arrested
mental development, then the spirit of carp-
ing dies, and the sturdiest of rebels begins to
accept the whole business as a matter of
course.
That is the first stage in the training of a
soldier. It is as far as I have got at present.
Oxford.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Shaking the Bones of Cobden in the
Teeth of Reform.
The deadly fear that after the war Britain
mav come to her senses and go in tor a soim
tariff reform which will give her own people a
job sits like a nightmare on the chests ot
some peo])le in London and Manchestei.
After the I’aris Conference, where W •
Hughes, lifelong Freetrader and tan
sinker, voiced a furious appeal for the crus 1
ing of German trade by inserting a i ig
m a role of apparently meaningless words in
certain resolutions, the London Daily JSe s
came out with the amazing declaration that
“it was Freetrade that enabled Lngland
bear the brunt of the war.” _ By what ex-
traordinary jirocess of reasoning the choco-
late daily arrived at that conclusion t e
cables give no hint; but it is evident enough
that the doctrines of Cobpen are still being
preached in spite of all they have involved,
and that there are people fatuous enough

its means of livelihood to the foreigner an

On all the evidence, it seems quite Pl aia
that but for the ConoEN-ites Germany would
never have risen to the height of wealt
and power which could make a war on sue
a scale possible. Living on her outside in-
vestments and her carrying trade, Britan
starved her own people, increased the num-
bers of her odd-jobbers and reduced the total
of her genuine industrials, and then pointei
with pride to the fact that the things made
in Germany were cheap. And all the tim

in the struggle hiust remain one of the great
Nothing has yet come to light
which can show that it had the most remote
connection with war preparation. On the
contrary, Freetrade practically caused the
war, was in effect set aside when the war
began, and can only be revived if the nation
decides on suicide when the war is over.
How About Australia?
It is easy enough to understand why Pro-
tectionist newspapers in London should be
turning handsprings over the resolutions
adopted at the Paris Economic Conference.
They have their propaganda to push and
these resolutions are obviously of much
assistance in carrying on the job. But
there is nothing in them to cause any Aus-
tralian to fling up his hat, nor on the face
of them any indication that all Hughes’s
strenuous elbowings to get into the proceed-
ings were of any service to the people of
this country. The exact purpose of the
Conference was never clear. It was pro-
bably _ more diplomatic than anything else.
Certainly the powers of the delegates were
extremely limited. They could bind their
respective Governments to nothing, and it
is more than likely that the real object of
the Conference was to frame something for
the special entertainment of Berlin. Any-
how, that is what it did. How much it will
impress the German remains to be seen.
Perhaps he will not be impressed at all.
What the rest of the world will probably
be most impressed by is that the war is still
in full blast. Whether it can be so con-
cluded that it will be possible to impose the
Conference resolutions upon the enemy is
a question going to. the heart of the whole
business. It is a question not answered
by making optimistic forecasts. There are
half a dozen conceivable endings to this
war, and the one which alone would make
possible a situation such as was envisaged
at Paris is not the most probable of them.
It is no good being deluded on this point.
In any case, Australian soldiers are not
fighting in France to keep German-made
frying-pans out of the Commonwealth. That
can be done by work in Australia. The only
reason it had not been accomplished before-
hand was that quite a number of people were
unpatriotic, lazy and blind. The kernel of
the long series of resolutions is that the
Allies undertake to increase their produc-
tion, make themselves independent of enemy
countries so far as raw materials and
“manufactured articles essential to the nor-
mal development of their economic activi-
ties” are concerned, and facilitate the inter-
change of products. And they are to do
this by adopting “such measures as seem to
them most suitable for carrying out this
resolution... .according to the principles
which govern their economic policy.” It
was not necessary for Australia to get into
the war or to stay in it to know that she
wanted a tariff. The loud reminder on the
subject from Paris is merely a repetition of
what has been said a thousand times within
the Commonwealth, and the essence of it all
is that the duty of Australia is to get
busy on the vital affairs of the nation. It
will he as easy as tumbling off a log for
Australia after valiantly blatherskiting
about German trade to find herself 10 years
hence in essentially the same economic and
industrial condition as she was prior to the
war, and yet to have conformed to the
spirit of the Paris resolutions. Australia
has heard the voice of Hughes lifted afar
off in strident protestation about the Empire
and the German. What Australia still has
to hear about is the distinctly Australian
side to the problem. To us that is the
important point. Rooting out German
trade in Australia while war is on is one
thing—and easy. Building up Australian
trade is another. And that we must do in
Australia and for ourselves.

Enter the Prophet’s Family with a Gun.
The green flag of Mahomet, which didn’t
wave when the Bulgar was at the gate of
Constantinople, and hasn’t been hoisted in
the present tumult, looks as if it might pass
permanently back to the land of its birth.
Arabia, the' land of mystery and the Prophet,
has leaped to arms, and the jump is not at
the throat of the Allies, but at the whiskers
of the Turk. Rebellion has been simmer-
ing a long time in the hot home of coffee and
dates, and it is scarcely to be wondered at
that the true Arab who first flashed a holy
scimitar in the name of God and the cause
of a great ideal has been looking askance at
some of the recent doings by the Bosphorus.
A Sultan, wearing the Iron Cross of the
infidel whose emissaries appeared in Arabia
only as tax gatherers and exploiters, could
not seem good in his eyes. The long pilgrim
railway creeping down from Damascus
looked a devilish contrivance to the ancient
faithful, particularly as it could bring sol-
diers to buck up the demand for taxes. Ihe
Turk, Teutonised and modern looking, made
no appeal to the imagination of Islamic
saints; and the sight of huge masses of the
Prophet’s followers prosperous under British
rule in the east, and contented under I rench
rule in the west, helped to aggravate matters.
The result is that Araby the Blest has risen
up with a gun and decided to break with the
breed of Abdul. If the Mohammedan world
rallies to the Arab cause it may be a good
thing all round. In all the greed of nations
for territorial expansion, no hand, unless it
were a Mohammedan one, as in the case of
Egypt and Turkey, has ever been stretched
out towards Nejd and Nafud and Dalma.
Arabia is the shrine of ancient things—per-
haps of things more ancient than a_y or
which the most imaginative archaiologist
dreams —and if the Kalifate returns there,
e reen flag and all, under the protection of
the Allies, it may save Europe some worry.
Tf only for the sake of poetry and romance,
it is up to some country to remain ancient
and refuse to countenance wireless telegraphy,
typewriters, ice-cream and musical comedy.
The Mexican Fire and the Danger of its
Spread.
The attempts of German agents to stir up
trouble in Mexico might easily have far-
reaching effects in causing a wide cleavage
between Latin America anu the big Republic
of the northern continent; in fact, if Ger-
man diplomacy were the thing it has been
cracked up to be, the discord in the western
hemisphere might almost equal that of
Europe. Three years or so back, when the
trouble in Mexico first became acute, the
big Latin States of the South were seri-
ously worried about it, and matters may not
have improved since. Of course, Mexico is
a sort of an outlaw, and the brigandage and
disorder prevalent there are recognised as
bad business all round; but the conditions
are not much worse than they have
been in the past in Argentine, Chile
and Brazil, not to speak of the mob of
smaller republics further north. United
States interference in the island of Hayti
doesn’t matter much, as the landscape about
there is mostly nigger, but the interference
of Washington in Panama and Nicaragua
is more serious in Latin,-American eyes.
Some time ago the United States of Colom-
bia retired hurt and bitterly cursing from
w'ordy warfare with the Yankee; and
Venezuela, not so many years since, had a
nasty feeling of resentment about being dic-
tated to by a person who had very little
understanding of her local troubles. Alto-
gether, for a country that doesn’t keep an
army, and whose navy is pretty small in
proportion to the vast things it has to guard,
the United States has a good many irons in
various fires which, while small in them-
selves, might make a tolerably large blaze
if they came together. If the German were
clever enough to inflame the racial ‘feeling
of sympathy with Mexico, and Washington
seriously pushed the war beyond the Rio
Grande, the supply of American munitions
for the Allies might suddenly stop because
the makers of the fireworks had to turn and
defend Standard Oil and the Beef Trust
against the attack of 15 angry nations in
arms.
.
A Weary Old Swindle.
The scandal of the indecently spun-out law-
suit persists, at the expense of pretty well
every member of the community except the
lawyers who profit by it. The most cynic-
ally impudent example is provided in the
divorce jurisdiction. Here the length of
many trials is limited only by the capacity
of the parties to find the cash to pay for
them. For months on end divorce cases are
run through at the rate of dozens per day.
Then the steady business of unhitching the
indigent is interrupted by. a ‘‘society
divorce” —meaning an affair in which one
or more of the participants has money.
Those who understand the game settle down
forthwith to the spectacle of a lengthy if
not strenuous struggle. What follows is no
indication that justice was not done in the
hundreds of brief, business-like trials which
went before. It means merely that a horde
of barristers and attorneys have observed
easy money in the offing—and are out for
it. At the “advice on evidence” stage
counsel and the instructing solicitors begin
by earmarking troops of likely witnesses.
Many of them have nothing of any value to
say. But when they get into the box it is
counsel’s own fault if they are not anchored
there. They are encouraged to maunder
on about a hundred pointless incidents; to
tell how the respondent took a ticket to
Essendon on a day when the co-re. was
seen at Moonee Ponds; to detail the exact
position in which the lady stood while she
was buying the ticket, and the sort of
costume the co-re. was wearing; after
which the gentlemen representing “the
other side” uprise, and, with splendid assi-
duity, go over the whole idiotic yarn once
more. All at so many guineas per hour.
It is the best of good business for the law-
yers—one of the few departments of the
world of money-making where, while the
charges are exorbitant, there are no bad
debts. The legal gentlemen see to that by
insisting on being paid as they go along, if
there is anv doubt about the matter. But
it wastes the time of the Judges, who are
the servants of the public; it results in
monopolising court rooms, which are the
property of the taxpayers; and it provides
the community with the corrupting example
of a legalised swindle. A strong Judge can
do a little to check the abuse; but only a
little. Nothing will be achieved in a big
way till the lower legal orders acquire a
new viewpoint of their duties towards
litigants. But the profession is so but-
tressed by cant on the subject of its “high
ideas,” “unsmirched honor” and the like,
that reform from withiXi appears to be a
long way off.
A Glimpse of Russia.
From a neutral, formerly in Sydney, after
lately spending some weeks in Russia:
It is quite on the cards that I shall return to
Russia soon, though I hope not before the war is
over —or at least before peace is in sight, because
life in Russia under war conditions is not exactly
pleasant. This is especially the case in Petrograd
for, strange as it may seem, the official capital is
much worse off, in nearly every respect, than any
other town in the great Empire. This is due to the
fact that in times of peace Petrograd depends chiefly
on oversea trade for its supplies and fuel and
materials for its industries. Now, of course, every-
thing has to come by rail, and the railways are quite
unable to deal with all the extra war transport. Con-
sequently everything is frantically dear in Petrograd,
and there have been all kinds of “famines.” Also,
for want of fuel, the factories have had to stop
sometimes, and even the private houses could not
always be warmed sufficiently—and last winter was
very cold. In Moscow at Christmas the thermometer
went down to 30deg. below zero Fahrenheit!
Hack of organisation has always been one of the
Russian’s worst shortcomings, and it makes itself
badly felt again in this war. At times it has paralysed
military actions and spoiled the otherwise splendid
spirit of the army. But the Russians are a wonderful
people. Almost any other nation would have thrown
up the sponge in despair if it had got into the hope-
less mess that Russia made for itself last summer
after the big retreat from Poland. Think of the
awful disappointment: the collapse of one stronghold
after the other, and that after the brilliant .Galicia
campaign. And then think of the flood of refugees
six millions of them! It was chaos everywhere. The
stories one hears about the retreat and flight are
pitiful. And then to think that it was. all (or
chiefly) due to the highest and most responsible man
—the Minister of War. Either from stupidity ov
worse (there are very ugly rumors) he neglected to
order the necessary ammunition and rifles in time.
He is now being prosecuted at the demand of the
Duma. I am afraid it is going to be the biggest
scandal of the war.
But the Russians are more or less used to scandal
of this kind (there was another, very much the same,
of a General who betrayed his army in Eastern Prus-
sia), and they don’t seem a bit discouraged through
it all. For toughness and doggedness they almost
beat the Britisher—which is saying much !
As for trade and other possibilities in Russia after
the war, there is no doubt that capital and suitable
men will be the main difficulties. The German had
practically a monopoly of Russian trade, and
it won’t be easy to keep them out once
peace is restored. For although there is a good deal
of talk in Russia about “doing without the Germans
in future,” the conviction that it is possible or de-
sirable is not at all strong.
The Chinese Kitchener.
“Feng Siiui” reads a joint burial service
Between Ytjas Shih-Kai, strongest man in Asia,
and Kitchener, strongest man in Europe, there were
points of resemblance. Europe is as full of political
mandarins as China. The belly of the party joss
is as enthusiastically rubbed in Peking as in London.
The silver tongue of the Occidental orator becomes
in China the magic brush of the writer of memo-
rials, full of brave words and empty of intentions.
Amidst the torrents of oratory and blizzards of
memorials that swept around them, Yuan Shih-Kai
and Kitchener remained comparatively silent.
Kitchener's tall, straight figure looked like efficiency
in uniform. Yuan Shih-Kai, in his enormous
winter clothes, with his elephantine waddle, looked
like a fat, stolid, enigmatical Buddhist deity. Both
of them stood for efficiency and organisation. If
Yuan’s results were not as great as Kitchener s
it was only because his material was more pathetic-
ally impossible.
The fiasco of the Japanese war taught him the
absolute necessity for military preparedness. Through
all the subsequent ups and downs of Chinese political
life; through the stormy period of the Empress
Dowager’s rule, when heads fell like rain; through
the Boxer trouble, the Hundred Days of Reform,
the coup d’etat , the Manchu abdication and the
setting-up of the alleged Republic—through all these
he kept his head above water, because he possessed
a highly efficient little army, trained on modern
lines, and officered by Chinese who had been tlnough
the military mill of Germany. This army was the
trump card which he always threw on the table at
the right moment. It obediently broke through its
really good discipline and looted Peking merely to
give him a good excuse for not proceeding to Nan-
king, where the provisional Government had offered
him the Presidency while really thirsting for his
blood. The contrast between these troops and the
rest of China’s military machine was ludicrous. They
were Yuan’s soldiers, as the new British army was
Kitchener’s army, and without patriotic prejudice
would loot, burn and kill their fellow-countrymen
at his word. They gained him the Presidency, and
the Presidency gained him the money-bags. Especially
in his later days Yuan showed all Kitchener’s
contempt for political tomfoolery. The Chinese
Parliament, after 12 months of wrangling, tearing
of pigtails, bombing, knifing and poisoning, had not
decided on its own internal constitution. The
fangs, or political parties, were as numerous and
unstable as the shadows of the bush. Yuan sent
300 members packing. Those who made an
early start got to the foreign settlements
with whole skins; the rest disappeared in
mysterious ways. Yuan then, ignoring Parliament,
which talked itself to death, elected an advisory
council of his personal friends. The solemn farce-
delicious spectacle to the Chinese people —of repub-
lican government by means of a military autocracy
went on to the day of his death.
Yuan saved China from utter disintegration on
three separate occasions, and his dropping of the
helm seems to be a sign for the breaking of the vast
hull of the empire—that empire which with
a thousand leaks, a sprung keel and 40ft. of water
in the hold, has yet kept afloat through so many
international typhoons that it had come to be
regarded as unsinkable.
Arranging for Fifteen Years of Muddle.
“Chug’’ his kick :
The matter of reserving nine acres of water
frontage as a park is not one of enormous import-
ance; but small tufts of fur show the way the cat
jumps. North Sydney Council asked for the penin-
sula between Gore Cove and Bald Head Bay for
public recreation purposes; and the Government
replied that it could have the ground from July 1
for 15 years on the distinct understanding that it
handed it back at the end of that period, owing to
the “absolute necessity for providing water front-
ages for commercial purposes at the port of Sydney,
which was destined in the comparatively near future
to become one of the largest maritime ports of the
world.” Nothing could indicate much more plainly
the grip which the congestionists have on N. S.
Wales or the depth and sincerity of the Govern-
ment's alleged policy of decentralisation. Already
the port of Sydney is carrying just about all the
traffic which it ought reasonably to be expected to
carry; and the opening up of the closed ports to
north and south would leave a little room for the
children to play about the harbor’s edge. But the
Government apparently cares nothing for these
things. To pack Sydney to the infinite discomfort
of its people, the heaviest possible loss to the State
and the personal advantage of certain persons of
generous waistcoat girth, is evidently the secret
policy of those who have the political sway. Decen-
tralisation is merely election talk. If those who
have again and again promised to find outlets for
trade at other deep-water ports of N. S. Wales had
spoken with any thought of sincerity and had made
the smallest effort towards carrying their schemes to
fruition, there would be no need to worry about
Sydney water frontages. As things stand, it may
be taken that the case of the Bald Head park time-
limit affords proof that the State Government has
decided that there shall be no serious effort towards
decentralisation for 15 years, and for as long there-
after as the public can be fooled into believing
that an accumulation of bricks in one spot means
progress. Nothing could be idler than the idea that
the growth of Sydney to abnormal dimensions is a
subject for pride. Every additional brick stands
for further muddle and lessened efficiency ; and it is
about time that the State said definitely that it
could no longer afford to drag goods all round the
country for the mere purpose of filling somebody’s
pocket in Sydney when there were simple and direct
roads to the sea.
An Aspiration.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This is the shortest day of all the year.
So few the hours between the pale sunrise
And the first star of twilight flashing clear .
Give me to greet the day with shining eyes
(The little day too quickly doomed to die) ;
In love and patience make me very wise.
And if the radiant ones of earth pass by
Curve Thou my lips responsive to then-
mirth ; .
Or tune my ear to sorrow’s faintest sigh.
On leaves and stilly trees and pulseless
earth
I’ll pour a deeper measure of my love
Maybe a spring flower sooner will have
birth.
So late the sunrise in the sky above.
So soon the star of twilight flashing deal.
This is the shortest day of all the year!
N.s.w., .Tune 21.

BRAINS DIRECT EVERY OPERATION.
A business run by “hands” alone
soon lags in the race against another
run by hands AND DIRECTED BY
EXPERT BRAINS.
The Goodyear Tyre and Rubber pro-
ducts wouV never have obtained the
high pitch of perfection they now
possess had hands alone been respon-
sible for their production.
Every year a sum in excess of
£26,000 is spent in research work
alone at the Akron factory. The
rubber experimental laboratories are
the most complete in the world, and
discoveries made there by experts
have attained world-wide acceptance
in many industries.
Primarily their object is to ever and
always improve the quality and wear-
ing powers of Goodyear Rubber, to
eliminate waste and expense in pro-
cess of manufacture, and, above all,
to produce this year a better article
for the money than was made last
year.
That their efforts are successful is
more than proved by the ever-
increasing sale of Goodyear Tyres
and Rubber products, an increase in
1915 over the preceding year of 18;i
per cent, in Tyre products, and 98
per cent, in mechanical lines, such as
Belting, Hose and Packing.
Nothing that we have said about
Goodyear products has as much in-
fluence on Goodyear sales as the
things which Goodyear users say of
them every day.
Ask the user of Goodyear products,
and prove it.
Goodyear 1 vies, Tubes , Belting , Hose and Packings are now obtainable throughout Australia & N.Z
Verdun—and Other Places.
Verdun remains a nightmare mystery.
The story about the place being of no im-
portance has had a sick look for a long
time, and so has the confident assertion that
the situation could not he forced by the
German. The inescapable facts are that
Verdun has seemed to France important
enough to defend to the last ditch, and to
the Hun sufficiently desirable to attack in
the most desperate manner. Whether the
Hun is a lunatic and doing all tHis in
obedience to a brain storm is another mat-
ter ; and, after all, it is of little consequence
one way or the other. The crux of the
sanguinary business is—Will the French or
the Germans succeed in what they are try-
ing at the moment to do? So far the Ger-
mans are creeping closer, and at the begin-
ning of the week were almost where the
decisive struggle would be determined. They
must have lost enormously. The French
losses must have been very great, too. If
the German fails to get Verdun he will have
suffered a serious blow. If the French fail
to keep him out there will be nothing for
the Allies to rejoice over, unless it be that the
price the enemy paid for success was greater
than the advantage achieved. But on that
point there can be no certainty until it is
clear what price he did pay, what the
defence cost, and what the advantage
achieved consists of. Meanwhile along the
rest of the Western Front the position
remains one of almost-stationary activity.
The comforting signs are on the other side
of the scrum. There the Russians are still
toiling hard and successfully, and appear to
have pushed the enemy in the south right
back to the Carpathians. That is good to
hear; and as the Italian is also hitting
back hard in the Trentino, the Austrian is
a busy person. There are indications that
the German is feeling rather more anxious
about his sausage than was the case a year
or so ago. But the Allies cannot afford to
ease off in the least on that account. Bigger
and still bigger efforts are demanded —if only
to relieve a little of the awful pressure upon
the magnificent French. Incidentally, peace
talk is again rumbling in the rear; but the
kind of peace the Allies are after is not in
sight yet.
From the fact that there are still about
150,000 unmarried men of military age in
Australia who have not got into khaki, it
looks as if the Defence Department’s system
is wrong somewhere. The Bulletin there-
fore proposes:—
(1) That no further casualty lists should be pubs
fished. The knowledge that a man is liable to be
killed may stop him from recruiting.
(2) That no further military punishments or court-
martials be reported. The fact that a man is liable
to two or three years’ gaol for a military offence is
liable to turn him against the job.
(3) That no reference to rifles, cannons, bombs,
howitzers, swords, bayonets or other unpleasant
weapons be permitted. These give a shivery feeling
to many people.
(i ) That no reference to pen-ions be made. Many
men, being reminded thus of the dangers of the
soldier’s fife, may be thereby induced to stay at
home.
(5) That no reference be permitted to war profits.
The fact that fat war profits are to be made at home
is liable to restrain many men from enlisting for
the Front.
(6) That no reference should be permitted to the
heat of Egypt or the cold of Flanders, to the burn-
ing sand o! Sinai or the slop of France. These are
uncomfortable things, and many of the 150,000 who
haven’t enlisted must hate discomfort.
There are a number of other restrictions
which m : ~ht seriously be considered. Con-
scription ing vetoed by the political Labor
bodies and therefore “unthinkable,” the Gov-
ernment, which has promised “the last man
and the last shilling,” must plainly do some-
thing more than has been done hitherto in
order to get these 150,000 to the Front. The
fault seems to this paper to lie largely with
tlu Censorship. _t has permitted the people
to know that war is war —and under a volun-
tary system nothing is more likely to
keep a lot of people from recruiting than
that. If they can’t be got to the
Front in any other “voluntary” way they
must be cajoled there. Anything, in short,
including the complete muzzling of the press,
rather than offend the P.L.L. by bringing in
Conscription.
The Commissionership of Police in S. Aus.,
becoming vacant by Raymond’s superannua-
tion, has been filled in a routine and un-
surprising way. The various soldiers and
politicians suggested by press and public are
disregarded, and seniority in the service takes
Inspector Edwards into the top place. 11. A.
Ring, of the Commissioner’s office, becomes
Chief Clerk in place of G. L. Reed. This
means promotions for others for a long way
down the ladder. Indeed, as Edwards is
already 62, the whole question will be opened
again before long.

Melba duly gave 6clat to the first night
of “Quinney’s” at Melbourne Playhouse on
Saturday by appearing in portion of the
fourth act of “Otello.” The excerpt con-
tained none of the trills or thrills that the
audience possibly expected, but mostly re-
vealed in softly-sung recitative Desdemona’s
apprehensions of her approaching doom. The
scene was artistically set with a medieval
bed and other ancient furniture, and Melba
was charmingly made up for the part; but
the incident was too slight to show her
powers or fully test the ability of Fritz
Hart’s band. Of course, the songstress ren-
dered the music beautifully, and dramati-
cally created the atmosphere of tragedy.
The orchestra, too, did its bit very
well, and Miss Anne Williams officiated
pleasingly as Emilia, though her job was
so small that she seemed like an almost
superfluous detail.
* * * *
“Quinney’s,” the four-act comedy which
followed after a long interval, is quite big
enough to have an evening to itself. Written
by H. A. Vachell and showing considerable
dramatic craftsmanship, it presents the
story of a domineering curio-dealer forced
by circumstances and his feminine belong-
ings into adopting a more agreeable bearing.
The improvement in the ancient, Joseph
Quinney, is brought about through his
daughter, Posy, hankering after his foreman,
James Miggott. James is a clever cabinet-
maker and a steady and reliable youth all
round, but Joseph will not tolerate him as
a son-in-law. When Posy insists on marry-
ing the lad with the quiet but determined
approval of her ma, Joseph offers his rela-
tives the option of obeying his orders or
leaving the Quinney roof at once. Mother
and daughter accept the latter alternative
with a decision and firmness that tempo-
rarily shake Joseph’s resolution to crush
the rebellion. Hereabouts, however, the old
man’s fighting spirit is revived by James’s
vague threat to expose the fact that certain
Chippendale chairs, which Joseph had re-
garded as genuine and sold as such to an
Amurkan collector, were really fakes manu-
factured by James for Quinney’s brother-in-
law, Sam Tomlin. But Miggott’s and Tom-
lin’s participation in the fraud is of minor

interest compared with the suggestion that
Posy shall be the price of the young man’s
silence in the matter. Joseph gets terribly
angry about it, and carries the war into the
Tomlin household, where Posy and her
mother had taken refuge. Heated words
are bandied freely in the nex-t few minutes,
and another damsel is introduced to throw
suspicion on Mr. Miggott’s moral character;
but, after further argument, everything is
cleared up, the aforesaid female is proved to
be a false alarm, and James gets Posy with
her papa's blessing. Quinney’s changed
views on the subject are alleged to be due
to his sudden realisation of his foreman’s
sterling qualities, though he is probably
more influenced by the notion that so skilful
a furniture-fakir would be safer in the family.
Arthur Styan plays Joseph Quinney and
provides an excellent study of the rough,
homely and dogmatic Yorkshireman whom
the dramatist declares has the soul of a
connoisseur. The self-effacement, meekness
and devotion of Mrs. Quinney are disclosed
with positive brilliance by Miss Eily Malyon,
especially in the scenes with her forceful
husband. Miss Joy Gwyn is the physical
embodiment of the comely Posy, but her act-
ing merely amounts to reiterations, with a
relentless succession of pretty attitudes until
the bewildered critic almost howls for mercy.
“THE QUAKER GIRL," AT SYDNEY
HER MAJESTY’S.
Jerry (Phil Smith) and Pym (Claude
Bantock).
W. H. L. Cooper looks rather “correct” and
priggish as James Miggott, but, like Helton
Daniell as Cyrus Hunsaker, was not too sure
of himself on Saturday and will doubtless
improve in his work this week. Frank Keon
insists on the importance of Sam Tomlin’s
red nose in the scheme of things, and Miss
Llandley as Mabel Dredge affords a brief
glimpse of a lovely maiden’s unreciprocated
yearning. Gregan McMahon is only a cul-
tured intrusion in the last act, but he is as
effectively decorative as the bric-a-brac and
other priceless objects that figure with great
success in “The Sanctuary” of Act I.
The crowded state of Melbourne Princess’s
on Friday and Saturday last seemed proof
positive that the Gonsalez Opera Co. has
come to cater for a want and is judged to
be supplying the material. Of three operas
produced during the week “La Traviata”
scored the least success, although two of
the new artists were pleasing revelations.
Miss Gonsalez, as the heroine of the
“Camille” story, is a brighter and more
flexible soprano than the De Revers lady
who had the floor in “Trovatore.” She
couldn’t sing “Ah fors e lui,” like a Melba
or compare with many another brilliant
songstress of the concert platform, but her
warble was sufficiently sweet and her acting
of the part in all its stages, including the
death scene, was strong and convincing.
Miss Gonsalez shared the bun of approba-
tion with baritone Filippini, who figured as
the heavy father of the demi-mondaine’s
lover and voiced his sympathy with their
respective sadness in tender strains. Ilis
saccharine song to dear Alfredo moved the
audience to tumultuous encore. Alfredo the
tenor was another important first-appenr-
nncer—a tall, slim Dagradi in a cavalier
costume of cobalt blue velvet, the dressing
of this show being atrociously absurd. But
his clothes were much more beautiful than
his vocalisation. To Australian ears he is
a tenor only by courtesy. He has a nasal
snarl which is never in open con-
flict with the music, but is never tuneful.
I here are. several sorts of Italian tenors.
Dagradi is one. of the unsympathetic
sorts, with a saving grace of face, figure
and dramatic aptitude. It is, bv the way,
joyfully remarked of the Gonsalez Co. that
its three principal tenors are all tall and
good looking, and no member of the organi-
sation is conspicuously short and plump.
A thud tenor, who finished a good second
to Capelli in popularity, bore the brief and
easy name of Lois, and made a capital
arrival in “Cavalleria.” Lois is a mere
boy. in appearance, tall and debonair
equipped with a pleasant musical voice of
conventional Italian quality, and a natural
talent for acting. He was an interesting
young libertine in his long scene with De
Revers, who improved vastly on her first
night performance in “Trovatore.” She played
Santuzza convincingly; moreover, her tremo*
lous tones, taking kindly to Mascauii’s
music, revealed a little of the essentia? oil
of melody. This was almost lacking
in the singing of Miss Russ the
alleged contralto of the eo. Miss Iluss nre
sen ted a cute and saucy little Lola, wife of
the teamster Alfio, but her singing has
strong a tremolo that one note might as
well be another. The star of this “Caval
leria” performance, all things considered
was Scamuzzi, as Alfio—quite a different
cut of a teamster from all others that Mel
bourne had seen. A good, honest baritone
and a smart young man, Scamuzzi excels
as an actor. In “Pagliacci,” which followed
Mascagni’s opera, he played the clown
Tonio, who sings the prologue and subse
quently calls Canio’s attention to his wife’s
giddiness because she had declined to be
otherwise than quite proper towards him
Whilst Scamuzzi was great, not to say
immense, as the vindictive clown, a new
lyric soprano. Miss Visoni, was a delightful
surprise as Nedda. The little lady has a
smooth, sweet voice and a breezy, unaffected
style of expressing a round of emotions
Filippini again sang well, but acted coldly
as Selvio. The harlequin was well played’
and Dagradi’s vigorous histrionics in ‘the
Punchinello character made amends for his
failure as the tenor in “Traviata.” It was
in the double bill that the Gonsalez Co’s
stock made a rapid rise. The chorus— the
weakest part of the show thus far—did bet-
ter than in the preceding operas, and the
orchestra, which contains the best local
instrumentalists available, put in some fine
work.
* * * *
The dressing, scenery and swing of “Caval-
leria” and “Pagliacci” gave promise of ,1
fetching performance of “Lucia.” This duly
took place on Saturday. “Lucia” is ridicu-
lously Old-fashioned, nevertheless it will
always be beloved of Italian opera-goers
when the tenor is as soulfully musical as
Capelli, and the trillsome prima donna is as
satisfactory as Miss Gonsalez, and the famous
sestet in the second act gets a good all-round
rendering from principals, orchestra anil
chorus. Marlow’s theatre shook with
applause after the sestet item on Saturday
night, and the fourth act. which is mostly
tenor and tombstone, was beautifully sung
by Capelli. The new baritone, who came to
light in “Lucia,” had a commanding presence
and a lamentable tremolo.
* * * *
The Gonsalez order of production is more
merciful to first-nighters than was the Quin-
lan time-table. There are only two new

Julius Knight at Sydney Royal told the
almost-moribund “Royal Divorce” to take
up its decree absolute and march last Satur-
day. And the faithful old thing, hearing
the well-remembered voice, shook the dust
out of its Napoleonic uniforms, wiped the
cobwebs off its Moscow red lire, and
shouldered its musket. Julius falls naturally
into the traditional picture-poses and raps
out the familiar lines with fresh emphasis;
nevertheless there is a certain amount ol
weariness perceptible in his sound perform-
ance. Olive Wilton josephines appealingly

Napoleon was a bilious bloke
Who “chucked” his steady girl;
lie wasn’t one to see a joke;
He had a forehead curl,
His funny coat was cut away
Like Hope at Waterloo;
They made it so, the tailors say,
To let his stomach through.
Ilis hat sat sideways on his head;
He gave his troops no rest,
But frowned and fought, till Hope was dead,
With one hand in his vest.
They had no movies then, you see,
To film a fighting lad;
But that Queer Man of Destiny
Went on as if they had.
A Hat, a Frown, a Funny Coat
That let a Stomach through—•
They ruled the world in times remote
And fell at Waterloo.
I marvel at the actor’s art,
And wonder if it’s right.
Is Julius Knight like Bonaparte?
Was Bonaparte like Knight?

At Sydney Adelphi on Saturday Ben
Fuller introduced Wish Wynne, the “Some-
thing Doing” revue and a number of vaude-
ville turns. Wish Wynne’s character
studies of English life are delightful. Her
schoolgirls, country lass, slavey and ’Liza
are all genuine characters, each with a good
story to tell, and Miss Wynne interprets
them in convincing style and secures her
effects in a thoroughly natural way. In the
revue, “Something Doing,” there’s too much
doing that does not matter; and in several
places the show threatens to fall to pieces.
A subsequent series of one-minute dramas
was acceptable; and the gutta-percha
contortions of Ted Stagpoole were amaz-
ing. Charles Edenbury, who made half a
dozen attempts to light a cigarette with
imported matches whilst spinning on his
head, is advised to patronise the good local
product for the future. Harold Parkes
recited C. J. Dennis’s “Singing Soldiers,”
and Bailey’s clever posing dogs, an eccentric

MELRO URNE PRINCESS’S.

Bloom of the Peach, gilt of the Ginger-bread,
Once rubbed and gone, they have for ever fled ;
And though Revival come with Pipe and Dance,
No “Girl” shall dance with color, being dead.
For who, rememb’ring nights in that Sweet Age,
When all was Peace, can look upon a stage,
Yet see no Sword of Darkness hanging o’er,
Nor trace red smears upon the music-page?
Ah, some who revelled in this whirling Dance,
Poor victims are of Time and Iron Chance ;
No drum can wake, no song can cheer them now,
In the far field where broke Young Honor’s lance.

Omar Fitz Gerald might have expressed
himself that way if he had been asked to
“do” the present revival of “The Quaker
Girl” at Her Majesty’s, Sydney. This pre-
war frivolity really revives very well, and
though Tanner’s “book” doesn’t wear as well
as Monckton’s lively music, it isn’t as dog-
eared as the usual document. Leslie
Holland, who is one of the few survivors of
the original co., plays his old lightweight
part of Tony Chute with surprising dash,
and bright-eyed Minnie Love dances through
the job of Phoebe. Ethel Cadman makes a
dainty but fragile Prudence, and Alice
Bennetto, as Princess Mathilde, is just about
as thin. Phil Smith gives another version
of himself in the sad clothes and haircut of
Jeremiah, the side-slipping Quaker; and
Addie Lennard smartly doubles the angry
French actress and the Quaker superioress.
Derek Hudson, in a conical French silk hat
and a super-shopwalker manner, lords it over
the stage and all its women for one number
as Prince Carlo, the Gay Dog of Paris.

The adorable Paul Dufault will begin
another season of conquests on Saturday
night at Sydney Town Hall. He seems to
have good support in his little concert co.
this time too.
It is persistently rumored that a girl
called Vera Pearce has something to do
with the Follies at Sydney Tiv. and that
her work is improving. The turn and return
of Cardo and Noll, operatic singers, has.
strengthened the bill. They are specialists
who can look their press agent in the tace ~
and it isn’t because their press-agent is
deaf and dumb and dead either.
Sydney films this week:—
Crystal Palace: “The Ne’er-Do-Well,’’ a first-
class dramatisation of Rex Beach’s popular novel. Its
nine reels fill the programme.
Lyceum : “The Last Act,” which suggests the
futility of attempting elopement with an actress unless
you provide an audience (preferably your wife) ;
The Bugle Call,” a fine effort by a 15-year-old boy
lead; and “An Oily Scoundrel,” who was given the
slip.
Empress: “Army Remount Corps,” an interesting
war picture; and “The Girl with the Green Eyes,”
an exposition of cattishness.
Lyric : “The Moral Fabric,” the Triangle problem
play that has now worn well for several weeks.

Duncan McClure and the Poor Parson
are still appealing to the great heart of the
multitude at Melbourne King’s. That the
appeal has also reached the multitude’s
pocket is disclosed by the managerial inti-
mation that the first week’s takings made
all concerned feel happy.
Clement May, the convincing imperso-
nator of Dickens characters, was an inter-
esting new arrival at Melbourne Bijou on
Saturday. Bert Coleman, a whistling ex-
pert, and George De Almo, a smart banjoist,
were also heard a first time; whilst other
additions included Ibex, a shadowgraphist;
Arthur Douglas, the Scawtch comedian ; and
Sylvia, a serpentine dancer who relies for
her success on lantern effects. Belle and
Betty, just out from England, are dancers
of a different kind, their efforts being con-
fined to energetic leg-show in sundry pleas-
ing changes of costume.
“The Blindness of Devotion,” “An Enemy
to Society,” and “The Rack” were the
heavyweight thrillers at Hoyt’s theatres,
Melbourne, on Saturday. The first-named,
featuring Robert Mantell and Genevieve
Hamper, was exclusively screened at the
Olympia address. Similarly “The Rack”
was reserved as a special treat for Hoyt’s
Bourke-street supporters. But “An Enemy
Society,” wherein Lois Meredith is a
■fetching apparition, also had a turn at
Olympia after finishing its run at head-
. quarters.
New turns at Melbourne Tivoli this week
are Norton and Earl, unexcitingly versatile
in song, dance and raiment; Baslo and Yivi,
in a truthful but ill-appreciated exaggera-
tion of the British haw-haw golfer with his
attendant imp; and Gardner and Revere.
The humorist of the last-named pair is a
little man who makes easy game of the pre-
vious turns on the programme. Which is
surely the most trivial form of variety busi-
ness in the vaudeville sphere of industry.
Mary Dorr sings a poor little song prior to
presenting some passable character imper-
sonations, and the amazing Menetti and Sidelli
are as legitimately funny as before in their
fall-about act. A special engagement of
Selinsky, the Russian violinist, doesn’t rouse
the audience to enthusiasm. He is an all-
right artist in the wrong place, for his

repertoire is probably limited to a class of
music which the average Tivolian regards
with suspicion, not unmingled with dislike.
Another revival of “High Jinks” is put-
tin" in 32 nights and two mats, at Melbourne
Majesty’s. The management applies the
inopprobrious term “Frisky Frivolity” to
this gaudy story of the magic perfume and
the girls who didn’t mind. By any other
term it would smell as pungently. All the
High linkers go on a jag more or less, and
the purpose of the bottled essence which
plavs the name-part is to make everybody
feef that nothing matters. Two or three
notable changes in the cast make n 9 appre-
ciable difference to the result. Connie Ediss,
in place of Florence Vie, gives a rather fuller
expression to the gaieties of the long-giassed
widow who leads the intemperance movement
in the last act. Greig, lately the irreconcil-
able juryman in “On Trial,” is now the
plump husband from abroad who bumps
against his gladsome spouse' at a refreshment
table, and blithers awhile under the delusion
that he begat Dorothy Brunton before he
went forth into the wilderness. The rest of
the conspirators are Workman, with his little
bottle of joy-restorer, Field Fisher, Blanket,
Daisy Yates, Marie Eaton, Cecil Bradley,
Frith, etc., etc. The etceteras include the
chorus, and the chorus glorifies a multitude
of sins that are not hard to conceive.

At Melbourne Royal the trial of Frank
ITarvey will be interrupted by visions of the
past for yet another week or two.
Mirovitch and Piastro, the two Russian
musicians who have acclimatised their repu-
tations in Sydney, will appeal to Melbourne
at the Auditorium next Saturday (July 1).
Local musical circles have already learned
that Mirovitch is bonzer on the piano and
Piastro boshter on the violin.
Adelaide Tivoli has suddenly strafed melo-
drama and brought in Goldin of the illusions,
with a tiger and a lot of other clever people
to fill out the programme. Daisy Jerome’s
familiar flippancies are once more at the
Majestic, where also the solid Harrington
Reynolds continues. Barring Reynolds’s
“sketch,” the King’s, with W. IJ. Ayr -and
Yene Linden, now has a monopoly of the
acted drama. But the filmed kind is uncom-
monly strong. Besides the usual thing at
West’s and Wondergraph, the Yankee “Birth
of a Nation” war pictures are at the Royal,
and the unusual Vatican views at the Town
Ilall. Also the little Pav. is asking and get-
ting special attention for some thrills con-
cerning an ape and an infant and a chimney-
stack.
The true inwardness of Premier Holman’s
“Croix d’lionneur” has not appeared. Here
it is. In the first dark days of the German
raid on Paris, when wireless communication
everywhere in these seas was interrupted,
and rumors of predatory Bosche fleets and
cruisers roaming the Pacific were rife, the
small French community in New Caledonia
was marooned from all sources of news.
Holman (who had not long before visited
Noumea and France) was then, as Premier
of N. S. Whies, receiving exclusive official
reports from the British Government of the
progress of the war, and, knowing the
plight of the small French outpost, caused
a daily budget of news to be cabled. The
anxious New Caledonians first heard the
glad tidings of .Toffre’s decisive victory on
the Marne, and the pursuit of Ivluek to the
Aisne, from the N.S.W. Premier, and natu-
rally associated him with their relief and
rejoicings. This and a long series of
friendly services to the French officers and
soldiers passing to and from New Caledonia,
and other courtesies less conspicuous,
together with a sound knowledge of French
as she is spoken and written, secured the
unique acknowledgment from PoincarA The.
“Croix d’honneur” has not hitherto been
bestowed Australiawards, the nearest having
been Tom Hughes’s decoration of “Officier
d’Academie.”
“Ex-eontrib.”: N. S. Wales Public Service
has become tangled in the recently-passed
Superannuation Act. The scheme does not
become operative all round until after peace
is proclaimed, but a rumor is on foot that
any public officer over 60 retired by the
P.B. Board, for other than an offence, is
entitled to a pension, although he has not
paid anything towards it. Officers over 60
who ask to be retired, it is agreed, get
nothing, but the Board is afraid that if it
forces an old hand to pass in his quill, against
his expressed desire, it will have to recom-
mend him for a pension. Quite a lot of pub-
lic servants over 60 are now clamoring to
be kept on, and hoping that they will be fired
out. Meantime, the Board is approving of
the retention of has-beens while in mortal
fear that they aren’t competent to look after
their jobs.
Dropped out at Castle Hill (N.S.W.),
the other day, at 84, Alexander Kethel, once
the biggest timber man in the Ma State.
For the best part of half a century he had
a fleet of small craft dodging in and out of
the tricky bar harbors on the N.S.W. North
Coast. He knew enough about the timber
industry to see that Australia was living
on its capital, without a thought for the
future, and he did his best to establish a
State Forestry Department and a systematic
reafforestation policy. Thirty years ago
he stirred up Henry Pai-kes to move in the
matter, the State nurseries at Gosford being
the result; but Governments have mostly
been too busy catching votes to bother about
posterity’s rights. Kethel was in the
Assembly for some years, going later to the
Council. In the elected House he was mem-
ber for the ’longshore constituency of West
Sydney, which Billy Hughes now repre-
sents.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Masetto” : Max Vogrich, who died a week
ago ia New York, came to _ -Australia as
accompanist to the great violinist vSilnelmj
when that artist came this way in Hz. set-
tling in Sydney, he became conductor ot tlie
Sydney Liedertafel, and was the first to
wield the baton over the Sydney 1 hilhar-
monic. But he did not reign long, and was
succeeded by pianist Kowalsky. Alice, Rees,
who was making a reputation as a singer,
married Vogrich in 1884, and they soon after-
wards left for the U.S. The “Australian
Nightingale” survives him.
“II.O.”: Musical critics of the Melbourne
dailies protest against encores being given
in the Gonsalez productions of “II Trova-
tore,” at the Princess’s. I cannot appreci-
ate the objection. Surely operas like ‘ Iro-
vatore” and “Itigoletto,” with their set solos,
duets, trios and quartettes, specially invite
encores for numbers such as “La donna
e mobile”? In the Wagnerian operas
music and acting are closely allied,
but Verdi —the earlier Verdi —was never
above holding up the action to spin a
tune; and to suggest that the artistic unity
of “Trovatore” is ruined by the repetition of
these deliberately interpolated numbers is to
treat that melodious bellowdrama with
uncalled-for seriousness.
With the opening of the Majestic,
Adelaide theatres have completed then-
change of character. A few years back the
Royal had a monopoly of drama, and the
Tivoli of variety. Then the little King's
started competition in variety. Then
Mclntosh took the Tivoli name and pro-
gramme along to a big new house, which
had been meant to compete with the Royal
in drama. Now the Fuller circuit has moved
into a new Majestic on the old Tivoli site,
and shows twice a day, leaving the King’s
to try melodrama. The King’s would be a
good house for concerts or amateur shows,
but a new Queen’s Hall caters for them. The
Tivoli has a tendency to melodrama, with
special variety and pantomime programmes
occasionally. The Royal fills in the spaces
between drama cos.’ visits with pictures.
The Town Hall is available for anything
that doesn’t want scenery. And the Exhibi-
tion is used for big concerts and public
meeting •.
“Jean S.”: Hugh McCrae is to face the
biograph shortly as the impersonator of
Adam Lindsay Gordon in an Australian film
version of the poet’s life. As Mac. is related
to the deceased on his mother's side, blood
is expected to tell. The work, however, will
be necessarily trying, and will involve the
young man in at least 14 days hard in the
picture studio and in the country under the
supervision of producer W. J. Lincoln. Inci-
dentally Mac. will have to strike attitudes
in the saddle, but fortunately he has become
expert on the backs of plain mokes since he
turned his Pegasus out to grass.
From the Tivoli (Sydney) :
Vera Pearce: Have you read the Bible?
Weems: Yes; once.
Pearce: Then you know of Mose-aise?
I looked Mose-aise up in the Bible Con-
cordance, Webster, the Statesman’s Year
Book and .T. J. Miller’s Sporting Guide
without becoming any the wiser. To-morrow
I propose to send the lady some pose-aise
with a request for the address of Whatsit.
“C. Ockney”: Quiller Couch’s first
attempt as a playwright, an adaptation from
his “Mayor of Troy,” was produced at
London Haymarket lately; but it hasn’t
caught on, and is to be succeeded by a play
by the all-pervasive Vachell, Couch’s bro-
ther-novelist. This will make Vachell’s
seventh produced play during the last two
years. His best-known piece, “Quinney’s,”
has just been seen at Gregan McMahon’s
Melbourne Playhouse, and it might be worth
some manager’s while to stage here his other
successes, “Searchlights” (done by H. B.
Irving in England) and “Jelf’s.”
The cry of a musician in Sydney D.T.: —
For Sale, Bass Viol, French, best model, cost
£25. Bargain, £9. Viol, P. 0., Newtown.
What gives it pathos is that it appears under
the heading, “Poultry, Birds and Dogs.”
At latest Marie Lohr was rehearsing the
leading role in “The Show Shop” at London
Apollo. She plays a girl whose people want
to disgust her of the stage. The conspira-
tors arrange her appearance in a play that
they regard as a certain frost. But it turns
out a huge success and she becomes a glit-
tering star in a single evening.

“Bloore” : Don’t believe all you hear about
the wonders of Anzac Day in London. As a
matter of fact, in the hands of this muddling
English War Office everything was sacrificed
to ostentatious display—everything, including
the feelings of Anzacs themselves. At the
service in Westminster Abbey there were
scores of men who had not the slightest claim
to be called “Anzacs.” That the London
Coster might see something for his fare on
The Tube, tall and beefy fellows were
selected from battalions which had never seen
the real thing. I’ll say nothing about myself,
but will mention the case of a cobber—a
trooper of the 12th Light Horse —who with
22 others had to stand outside the Abbey and
watch late arrivals from Egypt march into
the Abbey. Although this trooper put in
several months of .strenuous work on the
Peninsula, and although liis regiment was
practically wiped out of existence, he, with
the other seasoned veterans, had to “do a
perish” on the kerbstone. This trooper is
about sft. 6in., can ride the tail off anything
that is horse, and is as game as they make
’em; but in spite of his Peninsula record he
was turned down. He wasn’t big enough for
this bit of theatricalism. I’m glad to say it
didn’t end that way, though. Birdwood came
along and happened to spot them amongst the
spectators. He inquired what they were doing
there. Being informed that there was
“nothin’ doin’ for little blokes inside the old
tabernacle,” he exploded three times and then
promptly arranged for the admission of the
turned-down 20, all of them dyed-in-the-wool
Anzacs.
* * * *
This comes from a Dutchman, formerly
resident in Sydney : —•
In Odessa I heard of a Russian who was in Sydney
when the war broke out. He used to be an officer
in the Russian Navy and served on the Baltic Squad-
ron that was smashed up in the battle of Tshsima
12 years ago. At the end of the Japanese war he got
into trouble with his Government ar.d thought it wise
to clear out to Australia. After a most adventurous
life he at last managed to get a position in a lawyer’s
office and worked himself up nicely. When the present
war broke out he at once decided to return to
Russia and offer his services to the Government.
As he expected, he was court-martialled; but instead
of being pardoned, as he hoped, he was condemned
to be exiled to Siberia. However, his friends suc-
ceeded in getting him permission to go to the Front
as a private. Within five months he had by his
desperate bravery got all four classes of the St.
George Cross (which is the Russian V.C.), and this
entitled him to be promoted again to officer’s rank.
He was then transferred back to the Navy, and when
I heaid of him he was commander of a ship lying
in port. As it happened, he was to travel by the
same train as I, so we went together to Petrograd,
where he was to meet his wife, a Sydney girl who
had just arrived via Siberia. They call him “the
Australian.”
That part of the extraordinary story which
so modest a man would tell, the Russian had
already told to Ernest Laurence, the Sydney
solicitor who had accidentally come across
him and engaged him as a confidential clerk
.in the firm's office. Prior to that he had done
many things in a little while; among his
other jobs he had been cook in a-city cake-
shop.
The parson who flings reckless statements
broadcast has been a nuisance for a long
time, and one of him has at last got a little
of what was coming to
him. While the tight
between Cold Tea and
Bung wps raging prior
to the Ma State referen-
dum, W. J. Ritchie, of
Newcastle (N.S.W.), was
holding forth from a bal-
cony in the six o’clock
interest. lie claimed that
the eight o’clock closing
which Pearce had en-
forced under the War
Precautions Act had
been a great improve-
ment, and, pointing to a
John Hop on the out-
skirts of the crowd, said :
“He can prove it.” A
local Bung interjected,
“The police are for nine
o'clock, not for six.”
“No wonder,” retorted
Ritchie. “Many a pot
they get from publicans
on the nod.” Challenged
to prove it, he added:
“It’s right. I’ve seen it.”
But when John Hop gave
him a chance to say
where he had seen it he
did the usual crayfish act
and pleaded that his
remark was a jocular
repartee to an interjection, and was not
meant seriously or used with offensive
intent. A dull beak couldn’t see the joke,
and said it was worth a pound, anyway,
with the usual costs, or 24 hours.
“Dalriada”: Old-timers grew reminiscent
over a burial in Williamstown’s quaint
cemetery the other day. The inmate of the
grave was Denis Mangan, once carpenter on
the Victoria, Australia’s first warship, which
took a rescue party to the Gulf of Carpen-
taria in search of the Burke and Wills ex-
pedition. Decadent moderns wonder whether
it was intended to reach the headwaters of
Cooper’s Creek. The Victoria did some use-
ful work in her time, and some of her crew

smelt powder. A sloop-of-war commissioned
in the early ’6o’s, her first commander was
Captain H. Norman, father of C. E. Nor-
man, chairman of Vic. Railway Commission-
ers, who was among the mourners at Sian-
gan’s funeral. The Victoria’s officers and
crew wore uniforms like those of the British
navy, except that silver lace replaced gold
on the jackets of the after-guard. The ship’s
first active duty carried her to Maoriland
during the war. Some of her crew took part
in the capture of several of Henare’s numer-
ous pahs. Having returned to Victoria the
little sloop compelled the Confederate cruiser
Shenandoah, then refitting at Williamstown,
to discharge certain hands illegally engaged.
Then peacefully she remained in the service
until the early ’Bo's, and was broken up a
few years later. But Mangan. the carpen-
ter, stayed on and was attached to the Vic.
naval forces for 34 years.

At Melbourne Stock Exchange—of all
places!—the war work of the Y.M.C.A. re-
ceived a boost last week. The brokers made
a little demonstration in honor of Lieut.
Throssell, Y.C., and that young khakied
hero from Westralia slipped in a good word
for the Y.M.C.A. service “abroad” and in
London. It is characteristic of the Victoria
Cross men in general that they seem always
to be thinking less of what they did than of
what was done for them.

Alf Farthing, ex-pedagogue, now publican
and M.L.A. for Yeast Melbourne, has lost
his £5OOO “rum, Rome and rascality” slander-
action against parson Worrall, the jury hav-
ing returned a majority verdict (nine to
three) in favor of the raucous Henry. Right-
eous George Maxwell and a pair of lesser
Bar-lights stated the case for Farthing, while
Irvine, K.C., made one of three expensive
pleaders for Worrall, so it was a glorious
victory for Costs. Now, unless Farthing has
changed his mind since making a public state-

“F.N.T.”: Edward Pescott, principal of
the Burnley (Vic.) school of horticulture,
sees this year the unique result of several
seasons’ wattle-culture. He is now able to
go out into the garden on any day of the
year and pick a bunch of some kind of
wattle-blossom —a happy consummation of
his gentle labors, even though a pawnbroker
may have his own ideas as to the value
thereof. Pescott. by the way, is one of the
few officials of the Agricultural Department
whose branch of nature-study never seems
to come in for hostile criticism, from press
or Parliament. The Burnley school is a quiet
spot, even on the busiest working day. Only
the hum of bees is heard, the occasional
cackling of the poultry-competition, the thud
of an apple falling from the bough, the
scrunch of the spade as the earnest pupil
turns the sod in seai'ch of wisdom, and the
faint moan of the female student attempting
to avoid the woolly caterpillar. But Pescott
is an energiser all right, and looks it; which
may partly account for the fact that the
critics leave him alone, or even go the
length of saying a kind word as they rush on,
knife out, to cut up the Research Farm or
hand one in the neck to Dookie.

As a lawyer sees it: —
Let me protest against the suggestion (B. 25/5,/’l6)
that “the Law has a stupid aversion to commas and
other marks of punctuation.’’ The aversion exists,
all right; but it isn’t stupid. When you realise
how little is understood about punctuation by many
quite intelligent men—printers included —you see
that it would be absurd to let an important matter
turn on the little mark that one lawyer may put
in and another leave out. Experience has proved
that one asks for trouble in placing any real reliance
on commas. They may be printed in a clause of
an Act for the sake of convenience in reading it;
but they are not a vital part of it any more than
the marginal notes, and a clear-headed draftsman
should have no difficulty in so using words that
their meaning is clear if all the punctuation is
swept away.

THE COMING OFFENSIVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some of the best authorities believe that we are
on the eve of great events. —Daily paper.
Scarred is the earth and red the battle flame,
The thunder of the guns rolls down the wind.
The master horror that no thought can tame
Rages among the nations stark and blind.
This is the lull of war and all men wait
The wilder hour of vengeance and of fate.
Those guns, forever loud with hymns of death,
Are but the treble music of the score.
The bass is yet to come, its organ breath
Blent in one awful and destroying roar,
When levelled trench and earthquake-shaken hill
Shall own in fear the strong avenger’s will.
We wait afar; but there in long array
The marshalled hosts chafe in the leash of pride
And count the hours towards that tremendous day
When ruin, armed by truth, stands deified
And headlong valor, eager for its place,
Joins with hot steps the mad triumphant race.
Keep still, unquiet heart. The anthem grows;
The awful sky is roofed with flying steel;
Fear its confusion heaps upon our foes.
At last, at last the Teuton stalwarts reel,
The word is spoken and the gaps of doom
With the fierce rush of long-pent manhood bloom.
Onward! The neighing warhorse, free at last,
Leaps with loose bridle to the trumpet’s bray.
The sabres gleam and war’s full human blast
Blows like a tempest through the stricken day.
Above the voices of the guns the cheer
Of faith exultant echoes long and clear.
And somewhere, girt with more than mortal dread,
A cold and fretful fury in each heart,
World-traitors sit with bowed, averted head
And helpless hands. Chill echoes round them start
And dreadful whispers run about the walls
As iron retribution nearer calls.
They staked their chance upon an iron shard—-
The loaded dice of battle long prepared—
ith subtle falsehood the fierce ga; le they marred
And, vaunting shame, the world’s long honor dared.
“Lo, war is war!” they cried; and war full-grown
Stalks through the wreck of all that was their own.
From east and west the wings of battle roll
Tumultuous floods of fire and leagues of men.
The last defence is broken and the soul
Of treason clings for rescue to a pen....
Shall these things be? The sand runs down the glass,
Time holds with truth and the swift moments pass.

CYRIL EDWARDS, Manager
From behind a mudheap in Mesopotamia:
The campaign here is plain gehenna. It is not
si ipuch the enemy as the country that makes our
progress so deadly and so slow. The Turks’ simple
tactics are to fortify a short line of defence resting on
a river on one hand and a huge marsh on the other,
entrench themselves several lines deep and wait to
b? attacked. The whole country is without undula-
tions, deep in mud, not a tree to be seen, and there
is practically no drinkable water away from the
rivers. We have to do all the assaulting, and as
the Turkish trenches on this flat ground are very
difficult to see, especially when the other difficulties
are helped by a Satanic mirage, we can't get as
much help from the distant fire of our guns as we
should anywhere else, and heavy losses are the
unavoidable result.
At the end bf 190 G the number of
trade-unionists in Australia was estimated
at 175,529; Knibbs reckons that in 1915 the
number had arisen to 528,031. It is rather
surprising to learn that when every occupa-
tion seems to possess a union only slightly
more than 52 per cent, of the total number
of male employees in the Commonwealth are
affiliated. Still, it moves. The N. S. Wales
Industrial Court is pondering over an appli-
cation by the Professional Officers’ Associa-
tion, comprising barristers, solicitors, archi-
tects, engineers and surveyors employed in
Government or municipal work, for the con-
stitution of a Wages Board. Justice Ileydon,
in a puzzled manner, said that if. the Board
was granted he might be pursued with simi-
lar demands from under-secretaries, the
judiciary and members of Parliament. After
that lot would presumably come the Union
of Overworked Governors and the Amalga-
mated Society of Searchers for Lost Money.

Ballarat, which generally sports two
bishops, has borne up nobly without any for
the best part of a year. Dr. Higgins, the
lI.C. prelate, died last September; and Dr.
Green, who wore the Anglican gaiters, gave
up bishing about the same time and settled
down near Melbourne. The It. C’s have been
the first to fill the vacancy, and have not
had to go outside Victoria to do it. Father
Daniel Foley, of Terang (Vic.), who has
been appointed, was until lately parish priest
at Creswick, in the diocese which he now
goes to boss. He is a cousin of Dr. Mannix,
Coadjutor-Archbishop of Melbourne. Mean-
while the Anglicans have found no one fit
to wear Dr. Green’s discarded apron. A
committee elected by the local Synod lias
the right to appoint; but the western Vic.
squatter-members want to hand the
.appointment over to the Archbishop of
Canterbury, on the grounds (1) that
they themselves are too wretchedly
ignorant to carry out the job of
choosing a boss shepherd of their own dio-
cese, and (2) that the special needs of Bal-
larat would naturally be better known in
England. Other members of the committee,
however, reckon that it is up to Ballarat to
drop the importing craze, and the denomina-
tional paper calls the deadlock "a scandal.”
NOT SO SUDDEN.
THE DOCTOR: “And if your wife dies during the night, shall I 'phone her people?"
a while report that she's buried.
AS CUSTOMARY.
THE JUSTICE: “Did you caution
the prisoner in the usual way
when you arrested him?”
THE LAW: “Yes, yer ’ Onner ,
free times acrost the ’ead .”
“Chasuble” : The World’s Catholic Euch-
aristic Annual Congress would have been
held in Sydney this year but for the war.
When the guns stop the Pope will give the
order and make the Yellow Pup howl. The
next location after Sydney is Lima, Peru.
Sydney will see a cardinal from Rome, with
prelates from everywhere. The most notable
of recent congresses have been those of
London, Montreal, Cologne, Malta, Madrid
and Lourdes. An Australian cardinal is sure
to be made at the local outing.
“Brain” : The exploits of the officer who
did some shooting in Dublin and was re-
cently adjudged insane, recalls the gentle-
man with bats in his loft who stirred up
Launceston in the early days. Major Gordon,
who arrived there in 1810, became affected by
sunstroke, and it so happened that at the
very same time a person named McHugo, who
had just arrived as owner and supercargo of
a vessel, also became deranged. On land-
ing from his ship he represented him-
self to be a, military officer of
noble birth, 'and assumed the
title of General Count McHugo.
lie said he had been ordered
by the Government of India to
inquire into and, if necessary,
redress the grievances of the
soldiery of Tasmania —of which
he had probably heard some
rumors elsewhere. He deluded
not only civilians, but also the
military who composed the
garrison, and was everywhere
received with the respect due
to his exalted rank. The mad-
man played his part
so jwell that the com-
mand of the garrison
was actually surren-
dered to him for about
a w r eek. Placing Major
Gordon under re-
straint, he instituted
an inquiry into the
conduct of the prisoner
as regards the hard-
ships which the men
alleged they had ex-
perienced at his hands.
McHugo actually sen-
tenced the Major to
be hanged ; and hanged
he would have been,
sure enough, but for
the timely return of a young subaltern named
Lyttleton, who had been away on leave. The
“Count” was sent back to his ship, and
had sense enough to skip as soon as possible.
“Gustavus Gravelpit”: Dr. Robertson, the
chairman of the Melbourne Board of Health,
deserves a pat on his frock-coated hack for
some recent remarks pertaining to second-
hand clothes. As most of us, if the war
keeps on much longer, will be rushing to the
old-clo’ emporium for our wearing apparel,
his words are timely. Says he: “I think the
Board should have power to compel the
fumigation of second-hand clothes before they
pass from a dealer to a custupier. . . .All
clothing in stock should be fumigated before
being exposed for sale.” This is so eminently
sensible I wonder it has not been insisted
on before. But if the Russell-street Israel-
ites, who do most of the Melbourne trade in
this class of goods, don’t raise their prices a
hundred per cent, for their new line of “fumi-
gated suits,” I'm no judge of the race.
The Separation Allowance Branch of John
Bull’s War Office gets some quaint corres-
pondence these times. One of the men who
has to deal with it passes these samples on
to a Maoriland friend :
Please Sir,—l have received your letter, and have
to say that lam his grandfather. He was born and
brought up in this house in answer to your letter.
Sir, —I am writing these few lines for Mrs. Morgan
who cannot write herself. She is expecting to be
confined and can do with it.
Dear Sir, —I see you have changed my little boy
into a little girl. Will it make any difference?
But the commonest little note of all is an
intimation that Mrs. Atkins is “expecting,”
and what has she got to do next?

A Melbourne doctor, lecturing on diet,
declares that “because of their oatmeal the
Scotch are more subject to boils than any

“Mujik”: Victorian Labor-leader Elmslie
remarks, apropos of the Melbourne bakery
riot: “Day was created for man to work and
night for him to enjoy himself and rest.” I
don’t know whether Elmslie is in the confi-
dence of Providence, but if he isn’t his
remark is sententious nonsense. Where is
THE LESSER EVIL.
HE: “What shall we do? Talk or dance?"
SHE: "I'm awfully tired. Let’s dance.”
the evidence to support him? Toets, phil-
osophers, bookmakers and Chidley all agree
that the day is for the enjoyment of man.
They tell us to get out in the open, to enjoy
the sunlight, go to the races and the surf
and work in the garden —to revel in the
sunlight, the breeze and the play of shadow
on the distant hill. Elmslie is merely a dull
Conservative. This chaining of people to
desks and workshops and kitchens while the
climate calls to them “Come Out!” is an
atrocity, perpetrated in the interests of
Greed. No good, lasting work was ever done
in the daytime and never will be, except by
surgeons, and they get busv as early as they
can. Will somebody less stodgy than Elms-
lie please summon the workers to arise and
awake and work through the wretched period
of blackness and turn the hours of sunshine
into hours of rejoicing?
TRUE TILL HEALTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sweetheart, if I were only sure
That you had been as true
These last two months or more to me
As I have been to you,
A happiness profound, divine,
Also blank wonder, would be mine.
For eight long weeks no Gladsome Eye
Has by your slave been aimed
At any girl. No maiden’s hand
Has by his hand been claimed.
No foot has known the tender touch
Of his. Can you, dear, say as much ?
Even in fancy I have been
As innocently good.
For weeks I thought of nothing much,
And then I thought of Food—
Of toast and fresh-made scones and cakes,
And pork and beans, and chops and steaks.
For quite a month the kitchen held
My chastened mind in chains.
I lay and yearned for ham and eggs,
And sausages and brains.
Would that your thoughts were so employed I
The news would leave me overjoyed.
But now we may expect a change:
My typhoid bout has fled,
My strength is coming back again,
And I am out of bed.
Later there may be more to tell —-
There mostly is when one is well.

THE PRICE.
LITTLE GIRL: " And was THEM all the money
they gave you for fighting ?”
F. W. Lang, Speaker of the M.L. House
of Reps., who has been figuratively smacked
with the flat of the royal sword and made Sir
Freddy, is an easy-going old farmer when
he isn’t swathed in the aweful robes of office.
Between sessions he used to boss ploughmen
and dairymaids on a fat little farm at
Tuhikaramea, in the Waikato, which he had
owned since the early ’7o’s; and there he
cultivated the gift of holding his tongue., He
is. short and spry and grey, and has some-
thing of the air of a military veteran. A
naval brother captained H.M.S. Tauranga
some years ago, and would have been an
admiral long before this had he not been
drowned on the China station.
Died last week old “Jimmy” Mirams, who
was a well-beloved subject for Melbourne
cartoonists 20, 30, 40 years ago. During the
14 years or so that the little man was an
M.L.A. he figured in the pictures as a rather
untidy wowser, armed with a fat umbrella;
but in his land-boom time of prosperity he
was a carefully tailored little chap whose
brolly defied criticism. That was the time
when the whole tribe of Mirams drove to
church on Sunday in clattering equipages,
and the horses were stabled at the back of
the tabernacle. In his political capacity he
talked so freely of finance that Melbourne
partly accepted him as a born man of busi-
ness with a genius for figures, whereas he
was really a professional Recliabite who had
graduated in the bookselling trade. His re-
putation was his ruin in middle age. On
the strength of it he ran the Premier Per-
manent Building Association, and as the
money came 1 pouring in Mirams poured it
out in rash land speculations and jerry-
built villas. He formed the original Federal
Coffee Palace Co., which was another bad
spec. Finally his supposititious genius for
finance landed him in the Criminal Court.
He was the exploded boomster who was
made a shocking example of. He got a year’s
imprisonment for unlawful hanky-panky that
was venial in comparison with the frauds
ot bigger rogues who escaped punishment.
Of late years he cottoned on to the Labor
party, and wrote a reminiscence now and
then for The Bulletin; but, taking one
consideration with another, the Labor party
showed good sense in not resurrecting him
for a Parliamentary job.

Captain Joseph S.
Crane, of the William
Mitchell, now in Hobart
port, believes he is the
last left alive of the old
school of skippers who
used to race in the China
tea trade. Fifty years
ago, on the clipper ship
Belle of South Esk, they
were becalmed east of
Sumatra, when three
pirate junks came at
them. The Belle carried a
cannon or two, and got in
a broadside which nearly
knocked the leading junk
endwise, on which the
whole three decided that
they had business else-
where. Another cher-
ished recollection of the
old man’s is the cuteness
of a Yankee captain who
drifted into a Chinese
port with a fairly slow
old tub in the days when
the fastest sailing ships
in the world used to race
home with the first tea
of the season. The Down-
Easter hunted out the
captain of the fastest
English ship in port and
challenged him to race
home for a stake of
£5OO. The Yank lost the
bet by a month or so, but
he came out ahead on the
deal, for the merchants
who heard of his bet con-
cluded that his hooker
must be something extra-
swift and rushed him
with about £2OOO more
than he would otherwise
in freight money
have got.

Through continued ill-health, Jack Lem-
mon, Labor M.L.A. for Williamstown (Vic.),
has had to forego most of his activities. The
~ one that causes him most regret is his tech-
nical-school hobby. After years of agitating,
m and out of Parliament, for junior “techs.,”
Lemmon has seen his ambitions realised in
a fairly substantial manner. For years
he had been a member of the council of the
central technical institute for juniors, but
has at last been obliged to give even that up.
Maoriland Judge Chapman’s Dunedin-
bred capacity for avoiding a smile stood a
good test at the trial of Itua in Auckland.
juror who had been called three times
and fined the usual fiver turned up late in a
bedraggled condition and explained that he
had stepped into the harbor on his way down
to the court, and was now too wet to give
his mind to a juror’s job. Chapman
solemnly considered the explanation, passed
it as satisfactory and scratched the fiver.
There are some hearts of oak in the pine
forests of the Tasmanian West Coast. A
pine-cutter named William Finn slashed his
toot open with an axe away up the Gordon
Kiver the other clay. Ilis brother Jim and a
mate left camp with him in a rowing-boat
at 11 o’clock at night, and pulled all the
way to Strahan, a matter of 45 miles, doing
the trip m exactly 12 hours.
Two Westralian priests were in the Sus-
sex when she was recently torpedoed in the

Osterley, were on the way to catch the boat
at Naples They left Folkestone in the
Sussex, with 400 other people, of whom 50
were lost. The two Australian priests man-
aged to get to Boulogne and thence back
to England. They say that when the Sus-
sex was torpedoed she was lifted 6ft. clean
out of the. water.

at Adelaide, aged 79, was a son of that Judge
Boothby who was “amoved” from the Bench
40 years ago. Another member of the familv
was the late W.R., who was author of the
Australian system of voting by ballot with a
cross within a square. The Boothbys were
from Nottingham (Eng.), where they knew
the distinguished Ilowitt family. A sister of
Josiah became the wife of Dr. A. W. Ilowitt
the explorer who went to Cooper’s Creek in’
1862 to tell Burke and Wills that thev had
lost their way.
“Billy Blue”: “Jolly Jim Conroy,” the
last of Cobb and Co.’s coachmen, threw un
the reins at the age of 80 the other day it
Tattersall’s Hotel, Sydney, where he his
lived for many years and was generally
known as “The Astronomer.” Conrov was
born in' England, but came to Australia when
a child. He first drove a coach from Nellisen
to Braid wood (N.S.W.) in 1858. In l8b()
he swung the mail on the Southern-road for
Crane and Roberts, having the stage from
Campbelltown to Bargo, and was so engaged
when Cobb and Co. bought the string of
coaches. Conroy kept ahead of the railway
till he ran the stage to Goulburn. When the
rail reached that town he swapped the box
for the mail van, and for 30 years was in
charge of it between Sydney and the west-
ern town. The old man’s handsomest boast
was that the length of his coach iournevs
was over 100,000 miles. y
John Shirlow, Australia’s leading etcher
has reaped the reward of years of industry
in the purchase by the Mitchell Library of
14 of his prints of Melbourne old and new
The library trustees have asked in addition
for a full set of his work. In private life
John is an officer of the- electric supply
department of Melbourne City Council. Born
in Sunbury in 1869, Shirlow as a youth
sketched anything and everything—even the
dreadful plaster statues in the Fitzroy Gar-
dens. As he had to be at work at' 8 he
was out and about by 4.30 each morning,
and once got in the line of fire when an
angry Chink pulled his gun on a flying
countryman. The arrival in Australia of
the Whistler and Seymour-Haden prints in
1891 made an etcher of the draughtsman.
He built his own press of Australian red-
gum, producing also etching grounds and a
mezzotint rocker, and in 1904 published the
first portfolio of etchings issued in Aus-
tralia.
Leighton S. Bracegirdle, who can add
D.S.O. if he likes now, is a son of
Captain F. Bracegirdle, one of Sydney’s
ancient mariners. Young Bracegirdle was
a clerk in an insurance office 20 years ago
when he joined N.S.W. Naval Brigade as a
cadet. He went to
China during the
Boxer rebellion in
1900 with a contin-
gent from the Bri-
gade, which saw no
fighting, but brought
back a few cases of
curios from Pekin.
Later, he took a
hand in the S’Afri-
can trouble. In 1902.
when the Federal
Parliament started
to economise in
naval matters,
Bracegirdle, being
only a midshipman,
escaped slaughter
and later on was
made naval officer at
Newcastle. He left
Australia with a
naval bridging train
last year, and had
charge of the making
of a pontoon for the
British landing at
Suvla Bay, where he
was wounded.

A DREAM OF BEAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Russian advance continues.—Press item.
The tyrant slept. Far off the cannon spoke
Their thunderous challenge to the tireless foe.
The chiefs of war with stroke and counterstroke
Tossed maddened leagues of manhood to and fro.
Wide landscapes leaped in flame, but still he slept,
Regardless still of tortures, deaths and prayers,
Till through the silence of his dreams there crept
Those awful bears.
He dreamt that in a happy summer green
He wandered through a meadow lush with grass.
The warm sun on the hills appeared to lean, ,
The little winds with music seemed to pass.
’Twas joy a while to leave the world behind,
To put aside his crown and all its cares;
Blithely he whistled till he turned to find
Bears and more bears.
Kaiser he seemed of mighty realms and proud,
Of battle hosts drawn up in long review.
The legions of his dream appeared to crowd
The whole wide earth, and far his ensigns flew,
Flaunting his glory in the eyes of men.
His feet were on ambition’s topmost stairs —
King of the living world he stood....and then
He saw those bears!
Loping along the dreamscape of his sleep,
Brown, shaggy, purposeful, he saw them come.
Hard-breathing, waiting for the rush and leap,
He watched them with dry lips that fear made
dumb.
Bears and more bears. The white fangs shone and
gleamed.
Bears in the rear to catch him unaware;
Bears on the front, the flank—the whole world
seemed
One endless bear!

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Commonwealth Treasurer Higgs and his
officers have devised a scheme o£ extended
instalments in connection with the third war
loan, and the assistance of employers is
sought in carrying it into effect. It is sug-
gested that almost every employee could
afford to lend his country at least £lO with
which to prosecute the war. more particu-
larly as the greater part of this money comes
back to the subscriber in one way or another.
This £lO needn’t be all paid at once. Five shil-
lings a week for a period of 40 weeks, com-
mencing on August 1, will entitle the sub-
scriber to a full 12 months’ interest at 41
p.c. p.a. payable on June 80, 1917, and in-
terest at ihe same rate each succeeding half-
year to the date of the redemption of the
loan in 1925. In other words, the Govern-
ment actually offers the working man sub-
scriber usurer’s interest for his money for
the first year, and thereafter 41 p.c., the full
amount of principal being repayable in less
than nine years.
This bit of 41 p.c. interest is likely to be
very handy before many years are past. It
is almost inevitable that, after perhaps a
first outburst of joy, tliei'e will be a long
spell of gloom when the war is over, and we
have to pay the money-bill. HiggA.puts the
matter very well indeed :— ■
Millionaires become millionaires mostly because
the vast majority of people never think of “the
rainy day.” “The rainy day” may come when the
war is over and two or three hundred thousand
Australian soldiers have to find employment. The
stoppage of war-time industries may cause a period
of trade add commercial depression. I do not say
there will be a depression, but if history is to
repeat itself, as there have been depressions after
every war, it is reasonable to expect a depression
after the present war.
AVfege-earners will be wise if they save some of
the money which is now so freely circulating awing
to heavy local expenditure for war purposes.
But, apart altogether from these latter considera-
tions, it is the paramount duty of all who cannot
yo to the Front to furnish the money to maintain
the gallant men who do go to the war, as ivell as
to support their ivives, families or other depend-
an ts.
As for the general subscriber, it can’t be
too seriously urged upon him that the money
simply has to bfi raised. If it is not
got jit Australia' it must be secured somehow
and on some, terms from John Bull, who is
not only struggling with his own vast respon-
sibilities, but is also helping to finance Rus-
sia, France, Belgium and Servia. Apart
from the fact that it is incredibly mean to
“tap the old man” when the “old man” has
such vast calls upon him, it will be far better
for ourselves in the long run to provide our
own war funds. If we now borrow from
abroad, we must later on pay interest abroad ;
that is to say, we must ship our products
away, "and get nothing for them. The worst
danger ahead of us is that the market value
of our products is likely to fall very seri-
ously. Only during the "past week we have
seen how metals toppled when it began to
look as if the Russians had got their steam-
roller going again. Already we have incur-
red a tremendous .foreign debt; and if our
products slump we shall have to ship very
much increased quantities to pay interest on
those old liabilities. If we borrow abroad
for war purposes at the present very high
rate of interest, we shall have to ship away
so much more products that our own posi-
tion at home may be deplorable. Especially
so long as this very high rate of interest
prevails, the only prudent thing to do is to
borrow from outside not one penny that we
can possibly raise at home in Australia and
Maori land.
And it ought to be as easy to float this
third loan as it was to float either of its
predecessors. For one thing, about three-
fourths of the previous loans have been spent
in Australia, so that three-fourths of the
money previously subscribed is available for
the new loan. As for the rest, we have
been getting tremendous prices for the wool
and the meat we have sold outside. That
Ave have been paying tremendous prices for
the aa’ool and the meat we lia\ 7 e been buying
from ourselves for ourselves doesn’t affect
the position in the smallest degree, because
it has simply meant a transfer from one Aus-
tralian pocket to another.

There are a few hard nuts vet to be
cracked in the War-time Profits Bill. New
mining cos. have shaken down one of them.
To ascertain what is a war-time profit in
such cases the Bill says the tax-collector is
to first allow 6 p.c. ou the capital and then
ask for half of what is left. That is a
vicious system, because the more heavily
a promoter has over-capitalised his con-
cern the better oft' he will be. In other
words, it offers an advantage to those people
who did the very thing that the Treasurer
is stopping people from doing now. Of
course that will be altered. What is going
to take its place this paper doesn’t know ;
but the taxable amount ought plainly to be
governed, in the case of mines, not by any
consideration of capital at all, but by the
market value of the metal sold. Take the case
of gold. Though the bill is called a “war-
time” profits bill, the thing really aimed at
is to get hold of war profits: the “war-time”
is used simply to avoid having to prove that
a profit is a war profit. Now there can’t
possibly be such a thing as a war profit
made out of a gold-mine. On the contrary,
gold is worth less. to the producer than it
was before the war started. This is proved
by the fact that various cos. in Westralia
are seriously thinking of closing down for
a while because the increase in the price of
commodities (including labor) has made
their operations unprofitable.
A somewhat similar case is that of the
life insurance office. What is called the
profit of a life office may easily be larger
now than it was three or four or five years
ago. But if the surplus is larger it will
simply be because of the larger numlt/fj of
policy-holders. So far as war profits are
concerned it is almost inconceivable that
there could be any. The A,.M.P. the other
day reported that for the past year
the claims (Ordinary Department) were
£1,390,751, of which no less than £343,053
arose directly from the war. The claims
were' almost all in respect of young or com-
paratively young men from whom in normal
circumstances the society might have expected
something more than the average number of
premiums. The direct loss is therefore
exceptionally heavy. On the other side, cer-
tainly, there is the somewhat higher average
interest earnings; but that is a small matter
compared with the other.

So the half-year shows the best profit in the
fist; and the best for many terms before the
starts. But whether the bank has
made provision for all the taxes that are in
view seems doubtful. Twelve months ago
the half-year’s costs, excluding only interest
paid and the trifle of note tax, were £6357;
this year, for a corresponding period, the
total is only £6318. That doesn’t look as
though any additional costs have come into
the accounts. ’there has been a
solid increase in the deposits—chiefly the free
deposits; people have been leaving money
really for safe custody. The bank, however,
is making use of a bit of it, and besides nut-
ting £22,000 into the war loans, has added
neai ly £oo.ooo to its advances. But here
are all the twelve-months 1 'movements :

Though the Tasmanian National has been
met easing its advances its holding of coin
and liquid iissets is very fair —about 41 p.c.
of all its liabilities. Still, that proportion
isn t so vood as it looks, because this bank
has an exceptional amount of free deposits—
money, presumably, held at call. While,
however, it is not in the strongest position
in the world to meet a sudden strain, its
creditors have quite unusual security. It
owes altogether £767,611. and has £313,678
liquid and semi-liquid. That leaves £453,933
to be represented by non-liquid assets; and
their book value is no less than £740,350.
That ought to leave enough margin to satisfy
anybody; and that, of course, is in
addition to the margin which the bank itself
required when it was making the advance.
The early future of this bank as of others
will be governed by the market value of our
principal products after the war. For the
present we are feasting—and a good many
of us don’t know it—on the strength of what
we are going to earn to-morrow, when the
bill will have to be paid. How keenly we
shall feel the paying of the bill depends on
what we shall get for the products that we
must pay it with.

Last year was full of bumps for a co. in the
wool and pastoral,agency business; but there
was some compensation for drought and
strikes and embargoes—the price for all sorts
of pastoral products was excellent, and com-
missions were very sweet in consequence.
But Goldsbrough Mort’s are something more
than commiss.on brokers. Twenty years ago
they were—to their own regret, no doubt —
probably the largest station-owners in Aus-
tralia. In those days and subsequently there
was a good deal of juggling with capital and
creditors. Some of it would be pretty hard
to justify. The co. had made large advances
in the old days of borrow and boom, and the
securities which they had been obliged to
take over were written down very hard
during the ’9o’s, share and other capital
being reduced to correspond. Ten years
ago the co. still had £965,667 in these
severely written-down station properties and
stock. Then a remarkable inquiry set in for
these assets. The co.’s stations were largely
leasehold ; and the value of these, especially
in N. S. Wales, jumped astonishingly, not
only because of the movement in the live-meat
market, but also because the graduated land
tax was pushing sheep-owners out of the
freehold areas into the western lease coun-
try. It was not only the leases out of which
fine profits were made; the stock on
these properties had been very pro-
perly valued at much under the • price
which they brought. The fizz in the figures
shown in some of the past 10 years is the
result of the transactions in these old assets.
But you can’t go on repeating them. There
is now only £260,771 worth of properties and
stock left to sell at a profit in the future.
Nevertheless there are excellent prospects;
for as properties, etc., have been sold and
profit accumulated, the co. has reverted to its
old and more legitimate business of financ-
ing the pastoralist.
The next table compares the position now
with that of a year and 10 years ago:—

The basis of the business is much sounder
now than it was in the early days of the co.
I/own to 1888 R. Goldsbrough and Co.
carried on in Melbourne, and Mort and Co.
in Sydney. Late in that year an amalgama-
tion was arranged, with the just-dead J. S.
Horsfall as chairman. It is interesting now
to compare the first balance-sheet issued
after the amalgamation with current docu-
ments. The total capital then was £350 000
and the reserves £243,246. Total sharehold-
ers money in the business, £593.246 On
debentures the co. owed £1,149,000, and in
deposits, etc., another £1,733.882. Total owed
to the public, £2,-882,882, or nearly five times
more than the shareholders’ funds. To-day
the shareholders’ funds are almost equal to
the public’s money in the business, and
instead of more than half of the liabilities to
tfie public being deposits and money owing on
open accounts, the all “other ‘liabilities”
amount to only one-tenth of the debentures
As this paper has often said, it isn’t so much
what a pastoral finance co. owes as how
it owes that matters. Most of the trouble
aiose in the past, not so much because the
mortgage cos. and banks had borrowed
Heavily, as because they had undertaken to
pay back on demand or thereabouts. This
co. learned its lesson. To-day it can afford
wait. instead of rushing a temporarily
droughf-depreciated security on to the
market.

But if one would therefore not expect thi •
CO. to make losses on securities, one wonkl
also not expect it to make anything like th
profits it has netted in the last six or seven
years—the period of the borrowing and build
mg boom. How abnormal the profits have
been can best be judged by comparing them
with those with which the table opens.

This co. was formed chiefly to handle house-
purchase insurance—a perfectly legitimate
offshoot of straight life insurance. The idea
is that you insure your life for a sum pay-
able in 12, 15 or 20 years or at previous
death. You can at once borrow three-fourths
of the amount of your policy to buy a house.
Or if the policy has been 'in force four or
five years you can borrow the full amount.
The house must be worth at least the amount
borrowed, and you mortgage it to secure re-
payment, with 54 p.c. interest. If you die
your beneficiary gets the house and the
amount of the policy less whatever is owing
on account of the loan. The policy carries
bonuses in the ordinary way. A good case
can be made out for this class of policy.
There are not very many young men just
making a start and anxious to do the utmost
for their young wives who can extract better
terms than this co. can offer them. At any
rate, it is well worth the attention of the
young man who wants to make sure that his
family will have an unencumbered roof
over its head at his death. He can’t do
that, of course, by simply paying a deposit
and instalments of house-purchase. On his
death, if the family’s income stops, the in-
stalments have to cease; and then if times
are bad the family is likely to have to go out
and lose a good deal even of what has been
paid.
In addition to the assurance funds, which
consist of the undistributed premiums, the
co. has a paid share capital of £17,684. and
an uncalled capital of £35,369. Twelve
months ago, when the co. had finished its
first five years, the directors pointed out that
‘‘the assurance fund considerably exceeds the
gross renewal premiums received from the
commencement, while the capital has been
preserved intact.” Considering how expensive
busiuess usually is in the first few years of
an insurance c-o.’s life, this was a most cred-
itable performance. Mainly, no doubt, it is
the result of not attempting to unduly force
business. The society is really the baby of
W. It. Dovey; and that highly respectable
parent valued the liabilities at the end of the
first five years. After making some allow-
ances for the youth of the co. he found a
surplus of £1783. “The business,” he said,
“could really he reinsured for less than the
amount in hand. The financial position is
unquestionably sound.” The principal assets
are naturally loans on mortgage and pro-
perty loans, together £36 588. The co.’s own
resources have been nearly sufficient to
finance the purchases so far; including a
trifle accepted on fixed deposit the liabilities
(exclusive of policy contracts) amount to
only £1958.
Besides house-purchase the co. does general
business, including, of late, fire insurance.
The year’s net premiums, however, amounted
altogether to only £3BO. Naturally there is
no profit worth mentioning here yet, and the
assurance funds at the end of March were
only £2lB.

“The proof of the pudding',’’ and all the rest of
it, is a phrase that has special bearing on the
quality of “Ghromol” leather belting'. This is a
mineral-tanned, long-fibred belting', made to stand
severe atmospheric and industrial conditions. It is
made from the finest Australian ox hide—perfectly
tanned to resist rapid deterioration. It grips with
never a slip—giving a drive that is almost equal in
power to direct coupling. Instal a trial length and
see for yourself that its proof lies in use. J. C.

Which ear he will purchase is the question which
presents itself to the professional or commercial man
requiring an attractive vehicle. The Milburn Electric
Vehicle, made in either brougham or roadster styles,
has, by its extreme simplicity, economy and dura-
bility, proved itself the ideal means of conveyance
for the most critical purchaser, and possesses consid-
erable advantages over any other type of horse-drawn
or petrol-driven vehicles. Anyone requiring informa-

ALUMINOFERRIC is used by the Sydney Water
Board, New South Wales Public Water Supply Depart-
ment, and many country Water Boards and graziers
for precipitating impurities and clarifying water in
reservoirs, cattle dams, etc. It is simply thrown
into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal. One pound will clear over 2000 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

Hoover Rapid Laboratory Sizer is unsurpassed. An
ordinary hand test over 12 different mesh screens
takes about 10 hours to complete; the Hoover Sizer
will make the same test in about half an hour. B.v
the use of one of these Sizers the saving in time
would, in a very short while, cover the small initial

fanning The present price of rubber is 4s. Od. to
4 ■ 10d' p er ib. Allowing that the price will fall to
i ow ' figure of 3s. per lb. for our output, the gross
return from the 210-acre block will be £3402, and
•liter allowing Is. to cover costs the net profit will be
£9268 from the first year’s tapping. In the second
veaVs tapping the further 116 acres now cleared
and in process of planting should return £1267 net.
That practically was the preliminary esti-
mate. Now that 1915 has passed (the
accounts, however, are only to September
j>o), we can reckon up how the directors
stand in the prophet class. Tapping com-
menced actually in May, 1915. But only
100 acres were ready, though another 150
acres were just on the verge. The crop was
1481 b. per tree. Thus far, then, the direc-
tors guessed well. The price, however, beat
them. The average realised was only 2s. 71d.
for all grades—that’s at Singapore. Profits,
consequently, haven’t come up to expecta-
tion ; but the figures in the accounts, on
which of course those in the table are built,
are little to go on. The tapping hadn’t gone far
when September 30 arrived, and little had
been sold. In a year or so we may be able
to get a fair idea of costs. But this much
can be said already: the growth of the trees
and the yield prove that that part of the
estate at any rate is very good rubber
country. The cost of development has been
a bit greater than was expected : still on a
capital of £18,531 at September last such
progress had been made that “it is antici-
pated when this report reaches shareholders
[in May] the whole of the available land
in the co.’s 808 acres will be under Para
rubber trees.” The position, though not
set out in the report, appears to be: —
Planted prior to Oct., 1913. . .. 310 J acres
Planted Oct., T3 —Oct., ’14.. .. 2604 acres
Planted Oct., ’14 —Oct., ’15.. .. 23 acres
Total .. .. 594 acres
That left 214 acres, which was all cleared.
Taking it all round, the Victoria looks as
likely to succeed as any rubber co. in which
Australia is interested; and its moderate
capitalisation and the remarkable absence
of promotion loading is greatly in its favor.
The Australian anti-German legislation
was among the subjects touched upon by
chairman Govett at the Ivanhoe meeting in
London. It was going to be a pretty serious
thing, he said, if it wasn’t handled very care-
fully. What had been done by the Austra-
lian Government involved the destruction of
the general principle of the integrity of in-
vestments in foreign countries; and as
Britain was the largest holder of foreign
investments, it seemed suicidal to attack
the principle.
From the chairman’s speech at the Hamp-
den meeting : —•
In association with other important producers and
the British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd., who
are the largest manufacturers of copper wires in
the United Kingdom, we have inaugurated a com-
pany for the manufacture of copper wire, sheet,
copper tubes, etc. The full realisation of our pio-
gramme may call for the expenditure of some
£200,000. The first section will co.-jt some
£lOO,OOO, and orders for the necessary equipment
have been placed. In starting this industry we are
complying with the urgent requirements ot the
Commonwealth authorities, and with the assurances
of such support as will satisfactorily establish the
industry. The demand for copper wire, sheet and
tubes is a largely increasing one, and the greater
industrial expansion which we all look for and which
is possible with the protective policy proposed by
the Government should ensure the prosperity of this
new and important project.
Incidentally the co. has put £lO,OOO into
the Ivembla works, where tlie whole ot the
copper output is now being refined.
* * * *
Having some rich stuff to draw on, Catb-
cart Central, Ararat (Vic.), paid os. last
half-year and carried, forward- £3221. 11m
efivs. raised the total return to 305.. per
share, so the old 50s. plungers have still a
long way to go to get their own back.
Manager George Bryant had to handle lyoz.
stuff against 2oz. 2dwt. dirt for the pre-
vious term, but costs were got down to i os.
Bd. per fathom. Still tlie figure is simply
appalling, judged by old standards. On
the other hand, Bryant states that by the
contract system he is getting 28 p.c. more
work, and the men are making good wages.
A surprise of the future may be a patch ot
good wash in a tributary off No. 7 rise. So
far none of these tributaries have ever
helped the Cathcart gutter; still Bryant
has pegged out 100 acres to give him room
to chase the little stranger. This also will
provide an escape valve for the nervy inside
crowd who have the blues over the forlorn
aspect of things in the extreme workings
south-east. The boundary peg is so near that
Bryant’s promised widening of the gutter
mustn’t be long deferred, otherwise lie will
have to go poking into tlie Laugi section ot
the lead to report the change.
* * * *
There is very little that is satisfactory in
the last report of the New Laugi Logan,
Ararat (Vic.). The co. was unburdened ot
its bank debit because with the mine hung
up and calls coming in it couldn’t help that.
But it hasn’t started on the track to divs.
yet. Finance has been made rocky not so
much by the extra wages bill as by the
failure of the Cathcart gutter west of No. 2
shoot to provide payable wash. Because
the cutting-up drives fail to prospect well it
does not follow that the gold isn’t there, as
the feature of the lead is its nuggets; but
the stuff Toole has gone through is so much
worse than usual that he doesn’t give it a
hope. Exasperating, too, is the distance he
is having to crosscut on the boundary to
pick up wash. The lead must have curled
north, shortening the length in the Cathcart
Central mine. Toole’s programme on the
big Langi gutter is a big mouthful. He goes
for cutting off the water in the south of the
junction with the Cathcart lead by a reef
drive from No. 2 shaft workings. Mean-
while he will push down the lead south
from No. 1 shaft, testing the wash by cross
drives 500 ft. apart. The inducement is
that the shoots lowest dowm the gutter have
developed higher-grade wash. Water is eas-
ing off, and if labor doesn’t turn down con-
tract work he should soon see what grist
panelling brings to the mill. If his ounce
estimate is realised and the plan of cutting
off the water far south pans out right, he
ought to be able to do cheap work and have
a mine.
* * * *
Greenfinch (W.A.) is urged by a local
critic to do some genuine development or
give up portion of the ground it is holding.
The co. has three leases, comprising 70 acres,
adjoining the Edna May and Deeps, but only
one has been prospected to any extent, and
in this values were cut off at a shallow depth
bv a granite bar. One of the other blocks is
believed to be worth deeper testing; but
although calling power and cash assets look
well on paper most of the money subscribed
by shareholders has either been “loaned on
short call” or “invested” in an opal bearing
area. As gold is in more demand than opal
the aforesaid critic rightly considers that
Westonia should be the sole theatre of the
co.’s operations for the present.
North Yilgarn (W.A.) rejoices over the
striking of an ample supply of water for ore
treatment in the Butcher Bird at Marda.
The want of water blocked the development
of a number of mines and practically para-
lysed the district. Much activity is now
being shown and crushings are being taken
out everywhere; 163 tons from the Butcher
Bird have just yielded over- 2500 z. of gold.
The Great Unknown and Allen’s Find are in
the locality.
Marvel Loch (W.A.) has disposed of its
remaining assets, and hopes to pay a final
div. of lid. before passing aw 7 ay. Portions
of its holding are still being scratched by
working parties. Several privately-owned
show's in the district are doing well.
* * * *
At the Ivanlioe meeting chairman Govett
said that the tonnage and grade of ore re-
serves w r ere undiminished despite the extrac-
tion of 240,000 tons since last year. Hopes
were entertained that the main ore shoot
would get clear of the porphyry bar at
3470 ft., but if it didn’t the decrease of the
reserve tonnage wrnuld not be so fast as
might be expected with a mine with no
bottom such as.the Ivanhoe. Concerning the
firewood trouble Govett commended the
general manager for the great service he ren-
dered shareholders by securing supplies of
coal and preventing the show from shutting
dowm. This had not <mly enabled the co. to
continue making profits, but also to retain
their labor force, the demobilising of wffiich
had been disastrous to some of the cos. that
had hurriedly ceased operations.
* » * *
A month ago it looked as if Great Fingall
(W.A.) would have to shut down for want
of labor, but somehow it has managed to keep
going. But the only chance the co. has of
earning profits is to run the treatment plant
at full capacity, and that is dependent on
securing a bigger force underground.^
Having overcome to a great extent the
dust evil in the Kalgoorlie mines, the in-
spectors are now grappling with the trouble
in the treatment plants. It is a
more difficult problem than was faced
underground, but already considerable
improvements have been effected. In
the interior of one or tw r o plants which a
Bulletin man w 7 ent through a while ago it
w 7 as only by considerable eye-straining that
lie could see a foot or two ahead.

Northampton lead and copper field (W.A.)
lias awakened from a long slumber and
decided to hustle for capital. There are oO-
odd shows in the district which have been
worked from time to time in the last 40
vears; about two-thirds of them are lead and
the balance copper. Local syndicates have
tried to w T ork most of them, but in near .'
every case an insufficiency of funds to cope
with water has blown them out. The Fre-
mantle Trading Co. «> operating on two of
them, and according to official icpoits is
doing fairly well.* * »
“Oofbird” : Is the Battler Co. (M .A.)
within the law? A second-hand mill is being
hurriedly installed to treat a few hundred
tons of high-grade ore, and when this has
been done its occupation for some time at
least will be gone. By dumping some good
stuff on the surface, blowing about the good
return that is to come, and announcing the
amount of amalgam taken off the plates each
week, somebody will be able to get out while
the public is getting in. This is the sort of
thing that kills mining.
* * * *
Manager Stuckey has got the Edna May
Deeps shaft down below 440 ft., and swears
that he will reach the required depth of
480 ft. without much hindrance. He may, but
the chances are still against his opening up
the reef with his present unwatering appli-
ances. The emphatic opinion of most mining
men who have gone into the matter on the
spot is that the cutting of the reef means
flooding.
Manager Craze had a tale of promise to
tell at the Round Hill (Tas.) Silver and
Lead Co.’s meeting the other day. Two
parcels of hand-picked ore were sent to the
Cockle Creek works as a bulk test. From
No. 1 tunnel, 1.4 tons gave 38.4 p.c. lead,
239.50 z. silver, 12dwt. 13gr. gold per ton,
and 4 p.c. copper. From No. 2 tunnel, 22.2
tons gave 157.4 p.c. lead, 61oz. silver, 3dwt.
17gr. gold, no copper. As No. lis the lower
tunnel this is reckoned evidence that there is
an improvement in values with depth.
The Heemskirk (Tas.) tin district boomed
in the ’Bo’s, though most of the shows ate
more than they gave. But the Heemskirk
Tin Syndicate reckons there’s still something
there. It is sluicing away the overburden,
and has a barge on the property ready for a
trial.
The Jupiter, a zinc-lead show lying on
the main line of the Rosebery belt and
between the Hercules and the Tasmanian
Coppei*, has been sold to a syndicate, which
proposes to float itself into a co. and then
get busy developing the property.
The signs are that the Mt. Lyell Co. has
definitely made up its mind to own the Mt.
Read and Rosebery districts. The snuffing-
out of the Hercules, Primrose and Tas-
manian Copper cos. means good-bye to a
laggard lot. With Sticlit in command, there
should be a wake-up as far as Zeehan. If
Lyell intends to go in for electrolysis, how
can it finance a 50,000h.p. scheme with the
limited capital provided in the options taken
from the selling group? The B. H. Prop, iron
and steel business has simply swallowed cash.
Yet Delprat hadn’t to do any experimenting.
There will have to be a big expansion of
the capital so far talked about; for Rose-
bery, unless Sticht has a surprise up his
sleeve. If not the variations in terms
shouldn’t bar the deal, as the country wants
every dormant asset vitalised.

“Buckley,” from North Queensland: —
“The Great Lake of Tasmania is reckoned to be
good for anything from 75,000h.p. to 80,000h.p.” I
do not think so, but perhaps I am spiteful, as it
knocked out my own little concern over four years
ago. I can forgive a genuine thing, but hate to be
beaten by a pretender. Take the data given by the
company’s experts who visited it in October, 1910.
Area, 205 sq. miles; net fall, 1000 ft.; rainfall 90
inches. Knock off six inches for evaporation and
we get 129,000h.p. I looked up the rain book for
Great Lake. Couldn’t find it, but got instead Lake
District. The average rainfall was about 40 inches.
Give it 45 inches. Multiply this by the 1000 ft. fall,
and deduct according to the recognised formulae. The
result is 18,000h.p. delivered to the generator every
second. Now 18,000h.p. is equal to 16,400e.h.p.,
which will become 11.000e.h.p. at the step-down sta-
tion. Bosh! Well I admit formulae sometimes go
wrong. This thing must disclose its power value
before long, and if it is much below what it is
cracked up to be, then the person who wants to sell
a hydro, will be met with the reply: “You cannot
tell the power. The State engineers couldn’t. No
one can!’’ And the person won’t bring off his deal.

Having put bucket dredging in the Malay
Peninsula on its feet and made a start in
Bolivia, it looks as though Australian min-
ing men might now do something in Korea
and Siberia. The Malaya Tin Corporation
(Sydney) has George Poole putting the
tape over the Korean option; and T. 11.
Martyn, the Sydney broker, theosophist and
dredging enthusiast, who arranged the co.’s
earlier business in Siam, is leaving at once
to look at the Siberian property. It is in
the Tomsk district, and considering that it
is alleged to be dredging ground almost
fabulous values are talked about.
The S. Aus. Oil Wells Co. hasn’t found
a gusher at Robe yet, but Charlton Dod,
the manager, is confident still. “Nothing
unfavorable to the chance of our striking
oil has been encountered,” he says. On the
contrary, “even if nothing more definite be
struck in this hole we have piled up enough
favorable evidence to warrant our putting
down bores elsewhere to search for the pro-
ductive sands.” Meantime, after drilling to
1575 ft., the co. is casing the hole to shut
off the’water —a tedious but most necessary
precaution.

Canada has encouraged the metal trades,
and as a consequence manufacturers of metal
goods and owners of steel furnace plants were
quickly able to adapt their works to the pro-
duction of war munitions. Thereby, through
selling some millions of pounds (the cable
says £60,000,000) worth of munitions and
clothing to the Allies, Canada is recovering
a fairly-large proportion of her expenditure
in equipping 340,000 men. Yet with the ex-
ceptiou, perhaps, of nickel, Australia is
richer in all metals than Canada. _ The dif-
ference lies in Canada’s past determination to
do her own job, wherefore no Customs duty
was regarded as too high so long as it was
necessary to shut the foreigner out.

How I Darkened My
Greyjjair.
Lady gives Simple Home Recipe That
She Used to Darken Her Grey Hair.
For years I tried to restore my grey hair
o its natural color with the prepared dyes
and stains, but none of them gave satisfac-
tion and they were all expensive. I finally
came across a simple recipe which I mixed
at home that gives wonderful results I
gave the recipe, which is as follows, ‘to a
number of my friends, and they are all
delighted with it To 7oz. of water add a
small box of Orlex Compound, loz. of bay
rum and -}oz. of glycerine. These ingredients
can be bought at any chemist’s at very little
cost. Use every other day until the hair
becomes the required shade, then every two
weeks. It will not only darken the grev
hair, but removes dandruff and scalp humors
and acts as a tonic to the hair. It is not
sticky or greasy, does not rub off, and does
not color the scalp.— Advt. [5

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, June 26, 1916.
My Dear Arini, —
The Munro Fairgusons, after a bout of
WeStralian welcomes, will get to Adelaide
about July 17, homeward bound for the
Yarra. Early in that gusty month his Ex.
adds A.D.C. Firth to his staff. He’s the
tall young soldier with the dignity of an
archbishop and a pair of blue eyes like a
girl’s. For a while he’s been convalescing
behind our State Governor’s chair.
Government House spread to the Jap visi-
tors had to be limited to 40 knives and
forks. The old dining-room isn’t a spacious
apartment for these days of big corroborees.
But its dignity is tremendous, and the por-
traits on the wall are solemn enough to
quell the most frivolous. The feature of
the decorations, gorgeous poinsettias, cast a
becoming blush on the official countenance.
The brilliant red blooms were much admired,
in fluent English, by Admiral Matsumura.
The mix-up over the invitations for some
of the official shows to the Japs—notably
the one at Parliament House —led to breath-
less sorties on the part of the uninvited. One
or two ex-Gaud Mayors, various aldermen
and innumerable indignant citizens wanted
to know who was responsible for the fact
that the pleasure of their presence had not
even been mentioned? They got in, of course.
But it was a last-minute’s anguished cry
for help that did it. The same chaos over
the Jap Admiral’s reception on his own deck
was not the fault of the visitors. They
left the matter in the hands of our sailors
at Garden Island. And they seem to have
left everything to Providence and the bo’s’n’s
mate. A nice social squall in consequence!
Dazed citizens who refused to believe they
were not bidden clamored fur help. In vain
this time. Garden Island ’phones went deaf
and dumb-*-there was an end of it!
The Government reception to the Jap.
sailors at Parliament House was shorn of
the star guests early in the afternoon. Ad-
miral Matsumura and his men—or some of
them —were itching to be off to Government
House. After profuse apologies and low
bows they did succeed in slipping away to
play tennis. On the courts the Japanese
wear soft-felt slippers with a pocket in each
for the big toe. Shod in silence they slip
over the ground very fast. But they hit the
balls sky-high—so high that indignant
sparrows on the Stricklands’ chimney-pots
scuttled away.
One feature, of the Iwate reception, with
the Jap Admiral as host, was a wonderful
collection of scenery in miniature. Every-
thing was on view—from imitation goldfish
fused with electric life, darting after micro-
scopic prey, to a Zoo furnished with toy
inmates. A Buddha or two gave a prayerful
effect to a Jap village. The Jap sailors
had sat up all the previous night to make
this baby hamlet, and our Botanic Gardens
had gladlv supplied some of the herbage. Our
Best People are busy elsewhere; but our
Second Best were in great evidence during
the gaieties, and had at last an opportunity
to. show their smart drapery. As for the
millinery, it either shot up like a church
steeple or sat squat like a penny tart.
. According to a male critic the most con-
sistently well-turned-out little woman of
the week was Mrs. Shimizu. The Consul’s
creamy-complexioned, petite wife has a
passion for European clothes, and gets her
gloves and. shoes on the roomy side to dis-
guise the tininess of her extremities. At the
Iwate party she wore a cream cloth coat and
skirt that was It from a tailor’s point of
view, and a saucy felt hat in the same milky
shade. Mrs. Archgaiters Wright and her
two daughters made an impressive progress
along the deck. Mother’s dark eyes were
matched by the serious brown velvet of her
fur-edged gown. Governor Strickland left
the show early, but daughters Mary and
‘r i, staye *? .behind amongst the scenic
waterfal s and jiu-jitsu items that followed.
All the local Consuls made an inspection of
SnfF f ? ar i S ° m ri ar^ OI V on view - The older
stuff looks like the heavy lingerie in which
Julius Ivnight so often thrills the gallery.
s P° rt y voung man who
used to attend Governor Strickland, has
officially, rejoined his old regiment in Eng-
hind. He fought in Gallipoli, you remember,
with our boys, and was wounded. Unoffi-
cially poor Wallis is still wrestling with
tlm effects of recent pneumonia, neurasthenia
and a few other casualties.
• A ll ew youn g gentleman will presently
join the Stricklands’ mdnage. He is a
slightly-damaged hero named Boulton, who
belongs to a- Hie lan’ regiment.
Colonel Bartlett, one of this State’s older
militia men, of late years on Headquarters
Staff, died lately after a few days’ illness.
“Charlie” Bartlett was a genial, kindly
soul who had the good word of the khaki
crowd in Barracks. Retired from the billet
of A.A.G. in 1912, he often strolled into
the mess to have a yarn with old pals in the
service. He leaves a handsome widow and
two sons.
A Brisbane man, Norman Christensen,
drove away from St. Philip’s with a Mos-
man girl, Doris Nankervis, the other even-
ing. At least, she had been Doris Nan-
kervis till a few minutes before. The
grey old church was abloom with flowers.
The bride and her father —7ft. or so of him
—were a striking pair as they stepped up to
the waiting ’groom. Doris floated through
the church in billows of white tulle over a
shimmer of silk. A new-old device of yards
and yards of white satin trimmed the skirt.
Of course there was a gleam of pale pink
on the fluffy corsage. Madge Nankervis, in
buttercup with raven millinery, attended to
the long bridal train. Second-best man was
P. Fleming, of Brisbane. The cake was
cut at Petty’s, next door.
The flapper em-
bracing the fiddle
and displaying
thereby an ador-
able elbow seems
to justify the
description “easy
to look at.” She
is a M.L. girl who
has done five years’
study under Di
Grassi in London,
and is now in Du-
fault’s concert co.
So that you may
know to whom to
send the costly
bouquets with the
diamonds hidden in
the flowers, spell
her name Florence Scapini.
The conquering Russians gave another
brilliant sample of their wares on Saturday
night. The Conservator]'nm was a packed
sardine tin. Pianist Miroviteh, the older
and more matured artist, stunned the local
talent into complete silence (it generally
chatters its criticism while the piano
ripples on) by a magnificent performance
of the Bach-Stradal organ Concerto! In
this, which took the chill off the pro-
gramme, M’vitch actually persuaded a
Chappell piano to gammon it was a church
organ. Piastro, holding his expensive fiddle
high up on one shoulder for a start, had to
warm the cold strings (I suppose a price-
less violin catches the sniffles as easily as
a baby) before he got his heavenly notes in
order. Later, with his colleague at the
piano, he gave Sydney a treat—Nicolaeff’s
Sonata in G Minor. And for once a Syd-
ney audience heard a programme straight
through to the finish. Then the pair re-
sponded to the tumult with an encore or
two.
Mith the Russian Mirovitch-Piastro duo
comes a big Belgian as friend and advance
agent. He’s Emile Bucker, the man who
controls so many theatres in Java. The
minstrels cleaned up the Dutchmen’s cash in
the spicy isles and brought the majestic
Bucker along to pilot their Australian tour.
Talking of his battered country, he wonders
—like others—at the folly of the Huns.
“They got all they wanted out of Belgium
before the war. Even on the streets of
Antwerp German was spoken. Now —and
I k Q ow the temper of my countrymen—for
100 years to come we will hate every
German who sets his foot on Belgian soil.
Others may forgive them. For us? Never!”
Professor “Andy” Stuart was 60 the other
day, and 250 faces met him at the Medical
School. The roomful rose and cheered
wildly, and the “father” beamed. It was a
great reception. After a three-minutes’ riot
the noise subsided, and the cause of it all
got his word in. “Gentlemen,” he said. “I
presume this is in honor of my 60th birth-
day (More tumult.) “I hope you may all
celebrate the same number. Of course, you
won’t, but by knowing your physiology you
will go a long way towards it. We will
now proceed to prolong our lives”—and the
lecture started.
Dr. Chisholm Ross gave away his eldest
daughter, Mary, to Donald Fletcher, a Queens-
lander, the other evening. Big John Fergu-
son was witness to it in St. Stephen’s Kirk.

Four full-sized lady helps-in-waiting made

in azure blue, flecked with rosebuds, they
were abloom with big autumn posies. A
large contingent of those bidden to the feast
considered the cream puffs at Petty’s.
An ecclesiastical note from an assisted
immigrant:—
If the S. M. Herald and Telegraph adopted the
plan of The Bulletin and retained the services of a
Religious Editor, assisted by a fully-qualified staff
of churchwardens and acolytes, their expansion of
the morning war cables would cause less merriment
in liturgical circles. Both papers, apropos the
Kitchener memorial service in St. Paul’s, gravely
announced that the Liturgy of St. Chrysostom was
sung to Kiefi’s chant. I guess the congregation
would get very tired if “The Divine Liturgy of our
Holy Father John Chrysostom,’’ according to the use
of the Great Church of Constantinople and the Holy
Mountain of Athos, had been sung in full, as the
said services comprise a pretty bulky volume, while
surely even the Herald knows that Kieff or Kiev
is the name of a monastery. What was sung of
course was the famous “Contakion of the Departed,’’
from the Liturgy of St. Chrysostom to the traditional
Kieff melody. One of the most dignified pieces of
church music in the world, its increasing use at State
memorial services is one of the fruits of the closer
understanding that now exists between the Anglican
Church and the Greek especially The Holy
Orthodox Church of Russia. It is frequently sung
in St. Paul’s Cathedral. It is not so well known in
Australia, but is heard from time to time at Christ
Church St. Lawrence and St. James’s (Sydney), at
St. Saviour’s Cathedral (Goulburn), and in some of
the Queensland cathedrals.
Did you notice that one of this State’s
squatting Ryrie family, Oswald, was married
in London a few weeks ago? He’s in the
Light Horse, and has chosen a Scotch lass
named Jean liowatson. She comes from
Ayrshire.
The slim, spectacled Sloman, the young
headmaster of Sydney Grammar School,
finds his glasses a nuisance. The local re-
cruiters won’t pass his eyesight. So he trips
to London, via Canada, to try his luck on the
other side.
The Merryvale Pops on Saturday nights
have caught on. Cyclones of encores show
that the average citizen wants a quart of
music for a thimbleful of cash. But the
treasury manager doesn’t mind. The list of
items includes everything from a Storm Fan-
tasia to “The Last Rose of Summer.”
Mrs. A. E. Hughes, Mrs. Sheridan and
Mrs. Royle were in charge of the recent
babies’ ball in the Palladium. Mrs. Back-
house, president of the Woolloomooloo Day
Nursery, for which it was given, also rounded
up the youthful dancers, and his Honor
stalked a toddler across the slippery floor.
But the lights were so dim that the kiddies’
fancy dress had to be guessed at in a tussle
between the shaded illumination in the roof
and the remnant of waning day. Mrs. Binnie
brought her curly-headed boy Jack along to
run a toy elephant service—threepence a
ride. Gumblossoms in tights and light deco-
rative motifs were specially good in 'the
fancy-dress section.
Verbrugghen, like
Hazon, objects to
the winter cough
only less than he
objects to the late
arrival. Everyone
is late sometimes.
But what Lady
Dorothy Nevill de-
scribed as “the vul-
gar and ill-man-
nered trick of the
Very New mem-
bers of modern
Society” to pur-
posely arrive half
an hour after din-
ner. or concert
begins, is a special
. , . nuisance just now.
At the Conservatorium they find the
doors closed when the Director gets

all the silence he wants. At a recent concert
f P lam cl , tlz J en / greatly daring, blew his nose

plied cannonading for the Valley of Death.
Social life in Victoria Barracks shows
all kinds of mild eruptions, due to the
changes and chances of war time. In the
old days Permanent officers’ ladies frankly
discussed each other’s domestic affairs—
from the color of the washing that hung in
Mrs. Colonel Starcher’s back yard to the
newest shade in Mrs. Major Highflyer’s
front hair. But the gossip, even when it
got on to the suspected connection with
“trade” of Mrs. Starcher’s grandfather, was
for the most part not unkind. There was
an esprit de femme amongst the women who
lived in the. long bleak terrace. In any
sudden crisis their housemaids borrowed
tea and butter from each other, and knew
exactly how much loaf-sugar Jane, next
door, could lend at a minute’s notice. To-
day this is all changed. Strangers, who
scarcely know each other, come and go.
Mrs. Icy.de Monde in XYZ quarters does
not “call” on her next neighbor for nine
months. By that time the good lady is her-
self ready to pack up. A Barracks tea
party the other day was up to the latest
good form in this muffled community.
Ladies who scarcely nod to each other on
the lawn assembled to solemnly drink pekoe
together. The arrival of the Icy de
Mondes, who never opened their lips except
to> say “Good-baye,” broke up the exhilarat-
ing affair.
The latest word from Mrs. Cyril Bell
(who used to be Mrs. Bob Brough) is that
hubby is now a sub-lieut. in the R.N.R., and
wears his uniform on H.M.S. Hermione.
Earlier in the war he saw seven months’
service in France, and came intact through
the Loos argument.
Died last week at North Sydney, Eliza-
beth Metcalfe, a daughter of that baronet
William Macartney, rector of the parish of
Deserteguy, whose brother was the late Dean
Macartney, of Melbourne. The baronet father
of these Macartneys was a member of the
Irish Parliament before the Union of Great
Britain and Ireland, and voted against Union.
The present baronet is Sir John, born in
1832. He is now, or wms verv recently,
living in Queensland.
The J.C.W. firm has lent one of its pic-
ture places for a Y.M.C.A. National Fund
show on July 19. John Brownlow, as hon.
manager, is rounding up a likely-looking lot
of events for the King’s Cross Theatre on
that date.
The 9th Brigade has sent its ultimatum
per hon. sec. ,Mrs. Alex. Jobson. Its sock
competition will not close till July 18.

A AVAR-TIME BEAUTY SECRET.
HOW TO LOOK BEAUTIFUL ON LESS
MONEY.
In these days of economy we welcome
anything which enables us to cut down
expenses, and many lady readers will gladly
accept my advice and try this excellent and
inexpensive recipe for the complexion. Any
chemist will mix it up for you, and it is
made up from 2oz. rose water, 1 dram tinc-
ture of benzoin and 2oz. flowers of oxzoin.
When well shaken it should be applied with
a sponge and allowed to dry, then dust the
face with a soft cloth. Even if you have
been using expensive creams, powders _ or
rouge, you will be surprised how much nicer
this lotion will make your complexion and
how delightfully smooth and soft your skin
will become under its influence. It will
save you money, too, because it takes the
place, in your daily toilet, of the best cream,
powder or rouge you can obtain, and the cost
is comparatively small. — Advt.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, June 26, 1916.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The vice-regal Fergusons lately decided
that they were quite as tired as Governor
Stanley, so started to look round for a
fresh visiting-place. Westralia hadn’t been
touched for a bed and breakfast, so, in
defiance of the seasonal upheaval in the
Great Australian Bight, the couple have
gone off to visit the Barrons in Perth, where
the winter is beautiful and Government
House is nerched high above a magnificent
selection of river and ocean scenery. By
the way, the Barrons’ “time” is up in
August.
Melba in opera drew the social battle-fleet
to the Playhouse on Saturday night. The
Playhouse has found its feet, for the Best
have “taken it up,” and the panting Intel-
lectuals will run alongside and see that the
baby isn’t dropped. (Excuse this mixture
of metaphors—l always do it when excited.)
Lady Helen and the Stanley dame blessed
the occasion, and though all the vice-regal
men were out of Melbourne the show didn’t
fall down and die of a broken heart.
The Willow Song was beautifully ren-
dered. The night-robe was a dream of white
chiffon and the dressing-gown of purple vel-
vet and ermine built on to a sheath of white
satin. Melba dropped this gown in a crum-
pled heap of fine color mid-stage at the
climax of a wonderful note and slipped into
the bed of dread with the orchestra playing
beautiful murder music.
Melba took her triumphant “curtain” and
was pelted with flowers. One popular doctor
made a fine cricketer’s shot from the far-
away centre balcony, and the posy landed
like a bird at her feet. Someone handed up
two chirpy yellow canaries tied up in a cage
with pink ribbons. A barricade of flowers
quickly gi-ew up on the stage, and Melba
ordered a taxi to take them to the Soldiers’
Rest Rooms just round the corner. Then
the stage was cleared for the Chippendale
furniture of “Quinney’s.”
Melba’s daughter-in-law sat in a box, with
tier black hair tied up in a veil of royal-
blue tulle. A girl with her added a color
note of bright seagreen satin and lit her
brow with diamonds. The Baillieux occupied
some latticed boxes, and so did Mrs. Isaacs
and her daughter—the clever one who is her
father’s Associate. The Fenners were in the
front row, and the Norman Bayles were in
evidence. Pianist St. Leger sat in the bal-
cony gloating. Melba herself had a box, and
when she came in to occupy it, muffled up to
the eyes in furs, the house nearly blew up
with applause.
Melba had a small duel with the musical
unionists the other day, and they allowed
her to win like musicians and gentlemen.
A scratch orchestra was being got together
for “Otello” at the Reps., and a non-unionist
was found in the band. The union leader
was just getting into his war-paint when
.Melba tackled him personally. The singer’s
smile beat him, and for Saturday’s perform-
ance (only) the lion lay down with the lamb
and forebore to eat it.
Lesley Madden gained another lap or two
on the next “Queen” by selling a £5O bunch
of supper tickets on Wednesday night. An
Evening at Home was arranged at Cliveden,
and you can imagine how the peerage rolled
up to it. Lesley herself wore brilliant
purple, with a band of purple round her
forehead. The Italians, who are the lions
and lionesses of the moment, were present
in force. They speak half a dozen words of
English between them, but got on famously
by smiling everlastingly and making glad
noises that don’t appear in the dictionaries.
Tenor Kirby, who is something of an Italian
scholar, was very voluble for a time; but
the visitors didn’t seem to have learned thmr
Italian in the same part. Mrs. McGilli-
cuddy had a supper party to help this St.
Vincent’s effort. So had Mrs. Tom Hogan
and Mrs. Tom Hogan’s ermine cloak. Mrs.
Davidson, whose husband keeps sheep, was
in with the Madden crowd for her last
party before departing for the Backblocks.
Mrs. Jack Sternberg had rose-pink touches
about her, and Mrs. Hennessy was good to
look at in black and white.
As it was a sit-down supper party, most
of the women brought their husbands. It
was quite a night-out for these poor fellows,
and their delight was pathetic to witness.
As a rule these patriotic sprees are attended
only by the women and a few serious draw-
ing-room males who audit the accounts.
There was a dais where the singers took
refuge, and the listeners who could not grab
lounge seats had to stand. Some suggestion
had been made of hiring light cane chairs,
but as the lowest tenderer wanted threepence
each for them, the idea was stamped on.
The show was kept as “select” as possible;
but, despite all the passports and entangle-
ments, some of the ticket-buyers left with
their imperial noses in the air. I think some
of them had been annoyed by the entry of
unconsecrated outsiders and others by the
lynx-eyed inspection before admission to the
card rooms. of the resident flatters
offered their dens as card rooms, but insisted
on personally choosing the paying guests.
A whole gang of private detectives, more or
less disguised as society loafers, were en-
gaged to watch the stairs and hold down
the doormat. If there is anything in this
world that gives me joy it is the feeling that
there are detectives everywhere, watching
and waiting and drawing their salaries in
coal-scuttles, umbrella-stands and pie dishes.
Mrs. Ross Soden, who has lately been
dusting out the ballroom at Grong Grong
and applying it to charitable uses, is having
a quiet time in the absence of most of the
family on war-service. Gordon, after mark-
ing time in motor-ambulance work for some
months at Reading (Eng.), lately managed
to catch the eye of the right people, and
went up aloft with the R.F.C. Captain
Jack is at Broadmeadows and expects to
be off during July. It will be his second
trip abroad with the Medical Corps. Soli-
citor Harry, who made a name for himself
at Henley before the war started, has been
twice turned down for the A.I.F. because of
an alleged defect in his vision, though he
can read his Bible by candlelight without
an effort. He is still struggling to break
in.
Mrs. Gerald Loughran, back in Melbourne
after a month in Egypt, was one of the last
Australian trippers to visit that country
before the edict was issued prohibiting offi-
cers’ wives from dropping in to see their
husbands.
Writing last week of Captain Fitts I
told you he had gone away from his own
Australia to get a commission. He was in
Bradford learning wool-classing, it seems,
when the war broke out, and he enlisted a
fortnight later. Had he been here the boy
would have enlisted here; for the Hamilton
Fittses are as good Australian as you can
get anywhere.
Natty little Dorothy Pearce’s friends are
organising a novelty variety programme for
a cabaret at the Austral Salon rooms on
Friday night. The proceeds, of course, are
to go to St. Vincent’s fund by way of votes
for Dorothy in her “Queen of Defence”
capacity.
.Miss Freeman, the Victorian girl who has
been talking about her experiences in Ger-
many, hails from Gordons, which is next door 1
to Bungaree, where the savages used to come
from. Miss Freeman says that in the early
part of the war she and other Australians
were treated very carefully. The Germans
were uncertain who were American and who
Australian, and were terrified, at that
stage, to offend the Wilsonites. The people
were told that Japan had declared war on
England, gnd the Japanese Ambassador was
carried through the streets on a golden
chair. They were also told that Japan had
sent troops to quell riots in India, which was
absurdly inconsistent with the other yarn.
But German diplomacy lies have always
been absurdly inconsistent.
Mrs. Melville, a survivor of the Lusitania,
has arrived in Melbourne. The poor lady
saw her husband drown and her two sons
spring off the deck to their death, while she
was in the water clinging to her six-year-old
daughter. The mother came back to life
on a destroyer; but the little girl had
died of shock. Mrs. Melville is now taking
unto herself a new protector. Mr. Walter
Best becomes her second husband some day
this week.
Rippon Lea, the Elsternwick home of the
late Defence-Minister Sargood, is still an
establishment of some splendor, though
parts of it have been pared off. The public,
which used to swarm thither to garden fetes
in the Sargoods’ time, have lately had a
to make comparisons, now that the
Ben Nathans have been offering views of
their orchid-houses at a shilling a time —pro-
ceeds to patriotic funds. The Nathan orchids,
attended to. by James Deering, who nursed
the collection through its youth, had in
Nathan’s Armadale days begun to gain re-
spect for their owner; since their transfei*-
ence to Rippon Lea they have gained wide
advt. as the most complete assemblage of
the quaint vegetables in Australia.
The Embling miss, of St. Ivilda, is begin-
ning to find a difficulty in storing the admir-
ing letters that arrive from kid-vested fight-
ing-men. The pattern vest was made of
kid-glove tops, very light and verv warm,
and only costing sd. to post to any part
of the Front. The industry began with one
for a young brother. It was greatly admired
in camp. “Sister made it,” he told them.
“Make you one? Of course she will!” So
a swarm of “orders” came along, and then
sister called for help. Now the vest is being
wern in most parts of the fighting area
where there are Australian soldiers, and
glove-tops come from the public in vast
numbers.
The State Parliament raises steam in the
old political boiler on Wednesday, July 5,
and invitations to witness the cocked-hat
solemnities from the Ladies’ Gallery have
gone out. Mrs. J. M. Davies is preparing
her usual tea-party.
Doris Gumming, of the Western District
squatter clan, is the latest pretty thing in
nursing probationers at St. Vincent’s Hos-
pital. Aunt McKellar married specialist Dr.
Dunhill not so long ago; so Miss Doris may
get a helpful hint or two in the family circle.
Astonished friends say this nursing business
is just to pass the time while the particular
Baillieu soldier in whom pretty Doris is in-
terested is away strafing the Hun. Any-
how, it is a good way of passing the time.
The Albert Miller widow sheltered with
her younger boy at Ballan after her dual be-
reavement of husband and son. She has now
come back to town, and is located in a Mel-
bourne Mansions flat waiting for a chance
to dodge the U-boats and join her two
daughters in London. Son-in-law Alan
Currie has been slightly wounded and men-
tioned in despatches, and nephew Arthur
Wrixon fell in action this month somewhere
in France.
Nearly all the richest Toorak families are
in mourning, the latest being the Grice clan,
who are mourning the Jack Grices’ youngest
boy Tom, just reported killed in France.
When the war started he rejoined the British
Army, from which he had resigned in peace
in order to return to Australia. He and his
young wife went off to England, and he got
a captaincy in the Royal Fusiliers. An
elder brother was killed in the Boer War.
Pasitoralist Campbell and family have been
in a turmoil of jubilation of late. They
had hardly ceased patting little Johnnie
for helping to pull off the ‘‘Head of the
River” victory when a cable message an-
nounced that son Walter had won the Mili-
tary Cross. Walter got a commission in
England soon after brother Donald had
waded ashore at Gallipoli.
George Fairbairn and his wife have
steamed north to Bananaland to look over
the family sheeprun and bake awhile in the
sun before tuiming back to Red Crossing and
politics in July. Mrs. George is involved
in too many of these things to take a whole
winter off.
The residents of Hay and thereabouts suit-
ably farewelled Dr. Field and his wife on
their departure for Melbourne, where the
medico from the country will get into uniform
and pack his kit for foreign service. The
Hay farewells then changed to welcomes to
Dr. John O’Brien, who has done military
work both here and in Maoriland.
Melba boxed in great glory at the first
night of “Cavalleria” at the Princess’s. But
she sat well back and out of the spotlight.
Her dress was a dead-black except for white
arms veiled w T ith fine black tulle. Tenor
Lois made an impressive first appearance.
He is a handsome boy who wears the right
sort of clothes. and legs. The principals
dress well —just as well as the chorus do
not. The chorus is so thin that you can
see daylight through it, and its clothes are
weird.
Adelaide rings up as usual: —
The weather is to be fined 40s. for being’ drunk
and disorderly on the day of the street-collection for
the Maruba Red Cross Hospital; also, £ 3 for re-
peating the offence on the day of the Maruba fair
at Austral Gardens on Friday. But the good, loyal
crowd rolled along and did its financial duty—£2oo
worth.
On the same evening there was a Government
House reception—a smallish and mostly official affair.
Next day the Victorian Stanleys departed, and the
Fergusons looked in for an hour or so on their way
to Westralia.
The engagement of our syndicate singer, Clara
Serena, to Roy Hellish is signalled.
Maude Plunkett, an Adelaide girl who did good
work here for the Repertory Theatre, and has since
been on the professional stage and in the films in
America, is on a visit to her people here prior to her
marriage to C. Langworthy Poole, of Chicago.
Mrs. A. A. Scarfe and Mrs. Gavin Gardner were
joint hostesses at a Queen Adelaide Club lunch t’other
day. But I don’t suppose it really will shorten the
war.
Old Dr. Bevan was billed to lecture on English
painters at the Art Gallery on Wednesday evening,
and the howling wind and rain didn’t prevent the
veteran from doing so in the coldest spot in Adel-
aide.
The League of Loyal Women, which is almost a
3 ear old, shook its rattle at a public meeting on
Thursday night, and the Exhibition was almost filled.
The Governor presided and said an encouraging word
as to the work the League has done and the more it
must do. Then came Lady Galway, who invariably
bears off the oratorical laurels when she speaks. His
Ex. of Vic. added a word ; so did Chief Justice Mur-
ray. The League has an eye to after-war problems
and depression, and makes sane and reasonable
economics and patriotic shopping two of its watch-
words.
The lute Syd Day’s blue-eyed daughter
Marjorie and young Arthur Riley have just
become mutually engaged, and are absurdly
happy.
Isabel Alcock, daughter of the late H. A.
(Billiard) Alcock and Mrs. Alcock, of Haw-
thorn, is getting her trousseau together for
a wedding with Herbert Smith, of the Mel
bourne City Council and Kew. iel '

The Victorian Artists have begun their
Pageantry by proposing to cast Carrie Haase
for the central figure of Australia.
Evelyn Scotney and husband Howard
White tuned up on Saturdav night at the
Auditorium. Melba’s pointed remarks
about the musical starvation of Melbourne

Dorothea Low, Mrs. Ted Dyson and Mrs
Jackson are preparing a cabaret for Friday
at the Austral Salon. A patriotic showlet of
course, and mysterious novelties are promised
besides the usual music.
Fred McCubbin and son Louis are to have
their combined show opened by Melba in
the Athenaeum on the 27th. The shutters
won’t be put up till July 11.
The arrival of the latest opera director
reminds me of a yarn that is going the
rounds. It is to the effect that Quinlan is
now keeping a hairdressing shop in one of
Arnold Bennett’s Five Towns in England—
Manchester, I think it is. If the story is
right, perhaps Quinlan is doing it for a rest,
with special rates for tenors.
Beatrice Day, who has been living in
M.L. these many moons, has started for
more exciting zones. Her son is already in
khaki and a trench.
Kitchener’s salute was a characteristic
variation of the one described in the drill-
book, and all the “permanents” here tried
to copy it after the great man’s visit, It
was a thoughtful, rather slow touch of bis
cupped-fingers to his cap-peak, and would
have been a very slight courtesy indeed but
for the accompanying bow. The exercise was
the despair of the officers here. Major (now
Colonel) Carroll gave the best imitation—
but he had to be on horseback. Unmounted
he lacked the Kitchener inches necessary for
the performance.
Petticoated patriots who frantically sig-
nalled the dear old Wimmen’s League in the
hope of waking the heads up to the dangers
of the “enemy in our midst,” have been told
to subside. “No politics in war time,” say
the social semaphores. (The anti-German
question is classed as “political.”)
Sleeping out is healthy, but it has its
disadvantages. A newly-wed St. Kilda
couple woke up in the dark hours the other
morning, finding the nuptial couch rather
chilly, and discovered that some person
unknown had invaded the verandah and
“pinched” from their bed a squirrel-skin
rug valued at £25.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.


DEWAR'S
THE THREE GREAT TESTS
OF GOOD WHISKY ARE
QUALITY—TASTE—AGE
Quality is the Essence of Goodness and Fine
Blending. It conveys that indefinable distinc-
tion, which makes a man a prince among his
fellows, and Dewar’s a king among Whiskies.
Excellence in Distillation is a Science; Pre-
eminence in Blending an Art. Dewar’s is a
Mingling of Choice Spirits. Quality stands for
Character, and Dewar’s for the ideal com-
bination of both.
Taste. The Taste of Dewar’s is the Golden
Key which unlocks all the pleasant avenues
of the memory. In Dewar’s Whisky there is,
something creamy and yet not cloying;
something velvety and yet not heating;
something rich and yet not obtrusive; some-
thing crisp and yet not crude Strong and yet
gentle, Dewar’s is the Paladin of Whiskies.
Age is the Crowning Stage in a series of fer-
mentations. Fermentation means Life. Age
dissipates its roughness, rounds off its edges,
and refines its character, leaving nothing
behind but the Rarest Elixir of Life. Dewar’s
is the Veteran of Stimulants.. It is ripe for
Promotion to your Palate.

upon all the bodily functions make it
unequalled for the prevention of colds
and catarrhal affections. If the cold or

CURSES UPON HER!
ETHEL ( very much annoyed with the
school-mistress): “Well, I hope the old
thing's young man goes to the war and
marries a hemigrant."
“Warre”: “A.G.B.’s” experience with
smut in barley was that of many wheatgrrowers last
season on Riverina. Carelessness in “pickling’’ is
the cause of the trouble. Steeping in half-bags does
not always mean that the brine gets to the centre of
the bag, and those who pickle otherwise invariably
put the grain back into a bag which has not been
“treated.” If the burst-spores are on the sack the
seed becomes re-infected. Unpickled seed sown on a
dry seedbed before the autumn rain very seldom shows
any signs of smut. Why? I don't know, but has
anyone seen a smutty self-sown crop ?
“Yarrum” : Here’s my instance of drunk’s
luck. One very dark night in June, a couple of
years ago, eight of us were out on a house-boat on
Lake Macquarie (N.S.W.). One of the party, a
publican, was the tightest man ever I saw trying to
fish, and I’ve seen some. He had a beautiful head
of hair and flowing whiskers. Presently he fell
overboard. 1 grabbed where I thought there was a
ripple, and landed a wig. Next grab I collared
genuine whiskers and we landed our man at the
other end of them. When he came round he told
us he had gone into a barber’s shop the day before
to have a clean shave, but was called out on urgent
business before the razarist had time to cut off the
life-lines.
* * * *
“Termite”: The assertion that white ants
kill trees in the Northern Territory is no more
correct than the argument that the Labor party’s
energy kills the foreign exploitation of Australia.
White ants never tackle a healthy tree; but once it
starts to decay the termite assails it. He who leaps
may discern the moral.
X- * * #
“Haldane” : I’m not going to vouch for
things as facts just because I hear them, but a few
weeks after Fox’s death in India I travelled from
Calcutta to Madras in the train with a Calcutta
chemist who had a share in financing Fox’s trials.
He seemed a fairly-truthful cove, and he swore that
Fox’s antidote was safe. Fox, he said, did not die at
once when bitten by the cobra. He was nipped at
10 o’clock in the morning, didn’t feel sick till three
in the afternoon, and died at 5 p.in. He was
bitten three times, but by carelessness missed one
wound, and treated only two. When he felt sick in
the afternoon he realised that it was good night. If
Fox’s care had been as thorough as his cure the Indian
chemist who financed him reckoned they would have
lifted the bonus for certain.
“Malice Root”: That old delinquent,
False Pretences, turned up again recently in the Port
Moresby district of Papua. A party of blacks in-
vited a neighboring tribe to a prime gorge. The
guests ran all the way thinking of nothing but what
the menu would be. They were the menu, and when
the last of them had disappeared and the strategists
were picking their teeth the unexpected happened in,
the shape of some John Hops. Lord only knows
where they got the clue from—found it in their beer
perhaps. In the clean-up patrol-officer Kirby and
two native police were killed. Now I hear that the
Government is forming an expedition to avenge
Kirby’s death. But there’s no mention of the dead
Johns. Are they protected now, or is the close
season over?
“Pick”: Among bullockies and shearers
west-o’-the-mountains (N.S.W.) queer matches are at
times the outcome of argument, but the chaps all
allowed that the dead finish was at hand when Fergu-
son backed his working bullock Baldy to take a quar-
ter start and race shearer Wright’s racehorse Greased
Lightning along a mile stretch of lane that led from
the Kilfera woolshed. The contest was arranged for
cut-out day, and every shearer, teamster, boundarv-
rider and dog turned out of the shade when saddling-
up time arrived. Odds of £lO to a tin of sardines
on Greased Lightning were treated with profane dis-
respect, but when a gun was fired to start the flutter
a revelation came to the horse supporters. Ferguson
had decorated his champion with a fanciful fringe of
tar-drums, kerosene-tins and hobble-chains, and when
Greased Lightning heard the fiendish pandemonium
of jangle occasioned by the laborious jig-jog of his
rival ahead, he turned and bolted towards Sunset, and
Baldv was whip-handled in an easy winner.

‘Scear-spring”: Begging pardon of
G.L.H.’’ (B. 25/5/’l6), “Stingo” is more right than
he is. Jhe solid high-velocity bullet has a greater
s attenng effect at short and medium ranges than
any solid low-velocity missile. The trouble arises
H l ®, fact that lt; does »ot “go through him,” as
G.L.H. presupposes. For full development of its
disastrous possibilities the bullet requires to strike
on or over a hollow organ full of liquid-heart or

bone, such as a hip, shoulder-joint or skull-angle
, resu , U 18 explosive, and the appalling injuries
thus produced gave rise to the charges of using ex-
plosive bullets which were freely made on both sides
during the first few months of the war. The makers
of some high-power small-bore sporting rifles warn
their users that deer and other medium-sized game
will be qui e unfit for the pot if shot, with a “solid

“F.H.R.”: To the man who follows pre-
carious ruining, bush contracting and such-like jobs
a permanent residence is out of the question, so let
him leani how I make a temporary house that fulfils
its purpose, can be rolled up and put on a cart when
the shifting is not too distant, or left behind at little
financial loss. Materials are two forks, one long,
strong ridge-pole, two corresponding side-poles, and a
bag fly large enough to cover. The side-poles are
placed in forks about sft. from the ground, and the
fly when stretched over the ridge and side-poles must
be tacked to other poles laid on the ground to ensure
tightness. One end of the mansion is filled up by
sewing in bags, the other contains the fireplace and
door, and a tent may be rigged for a bedroom. A
bag roof is perfectly waterproof as long as the fly
touches nothing but the ridge and sides. The cost of
a snug camp like this would not be more than, say,
ten shillings, and my evidence as to its efficiency is
that my wife and I and three small children lived a
winter in one at a mine near Orange and felt no
inconvenience even when the snows were frequent.

THE SPREE ON SODA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
The pubs were closed, and naught was left
But gingerbeer and tea,
IVhen Jones spoke out those magic words:
“Come, have a drink with me!”
It onlj' made us angry then;
A jest lie seemed to fling
About a circumstance that grief
Had made a sacred thing.
Brown leaned against a cabhorse near,
And wept salt, bitter tears;
While Blithers said a man who joked
Like that deserved six years!
But Jones declared he did not jest;
He gave a knowing wink.
“Come, boys,” he said, “I really know
Where we can get a drink !”
Still, when he led us to a shop
Where gingerbeer was rife,
Our righteous wrath was so immense
I feared for Jones’s life.
He calmly called for sodas—while
We raved about his sin—
And then he drew three bottles forth
And poured some whisky in.
i
In vain the soda-seller raved;
His anger we defied.
We drank his sodas by the score—
With whisky fortified !
The hours flew by on speedy wings;
And, finding all his fuss
Was no avail to get us out,
The Dago drank with us.
Then, when the whisky all was spent,
Like happy, sporting elves,
Home on our whiskied way we went,
And all mislaid ourselves.
With dawn I woke, to find my head
Upon a cabbage laid ;
While apples and tomatoes ripe
My bulging clothes arrayed.
In town I passed the Dago shop,
And in the window saw
Some prawn-lieads and a tray that held
An apple in its claw.
And three fat bottles stood upright
To tell the glad night’s tale;
'They looked as if they advertised
That whisky was for sale!
Within, a green-faced Dago spoke
To a policeman grim,
B ho, by the doubt upon his face,
Was not believing him.
1 don't know what ’twas all about,
But loud that Dago swore,
As with his waving hand and head
The atmosphere lie tore.
Of course, I did not interfere,
Bufj left him to his fate.
What right has any man to sell
Dull soda after eight?

This is a Work of Art, installed
“THE NELSON WAY.”
The proud owner of this elaborate, up-to-date Soda Fountain Bar is Mr. J. 11.
Draper, 719 Sturt Street, Ballarat, Victoria.
Mr. Draper is a keen, progressive business man. Nothing suits him but “the
best”; his Sweets Stores are the rendezvous of people who discriminate. So
naturally, when installing his Soda Fountain, he made exhaustive inquiries.
Competition was keen, but he couldn’t pass us. Quality told — we won. All
other makes of Soda Fountains were turned down in favor of a NELSON Plant.
Follow the lead of a man who knows. Mr. Draper tried hard, but he failed to
find a better plant than a NELSON.
The best that money can buy. The experience of the pioneers of the Soda Foun-
tain industry in Australia is at your service.

“My best friend —the
‘Pianola’ Piano”
NO man could have abetter com-
panion. Many are the times
when I have reached home dog-til ed,
my brain addled with thinking and my
nerves jumpy with worry. Then I
have sat down at this good. old
‘Pianola’ Piano of mine and, as if by
magic, my troubles have vanished.
“It may be because the ‘Pianola’ Piano enables me
to throw my mind wholly into the playing, it may
be inst the influence of the music itself, but what-
evel be the reason I get up from that in£~t
with my mind swept clean of the cobwebs of wry
and anxiety-ready and fit tor new tasks and
problems.”
So says many a business man who owns a “
Piano The “Pianola” Piano provides pleasure as
inexhaustible as the music it enabies you to play
and provides distraction that every worker needs
these days.

“L.E.”: What race produced the boom-
erang? Professor Stirling, of Adelaide Museum,
maintains that long-past, ages knew the implement,
but he can say nothing definite as to its origin.
There,are Indian boomerangs of iron and wood whose
“returning” qualities are, however, not ascertainable.
These date back several centuries. Quite the most
interesting exhibit in the Adelaide Museum is a boom-
erang which Prof. Stirling brought with him from
England about 10 years ago. It is of wood, and
was taken out of an Egyptian tomb. It is exactly
similar in shape and size, in fact in every particular,
to the Australian weapon. The tomb had been traced
to the Gebelen XI. dynasty, a period about 2700 to
2500 before the birth of Christ. Professor Stirling
wonders whether the existence of the boomerang in
Egypt, India and Australia may be taken as an indica-
tion of some far-distant communication between the
peoples of those three countries. That clue may yet
lead to the discovery of the true origin of the Aus-
tralian aborigines.
A SAFE BET.
NURSE: “I think little Rebecca grows more
like you, every day, madam. I mean no
disrespect to the master, ma’am, but his
face is scarcely salgble for a lady, is
it now?”
“Rail”: Re “Sliprail’s” flock of Border
Leicester ewes that averaged 200 per cent, of lambs
(B. 4/5/’l6). I can beat him out of sight, being
the owner of a flock that averaged 250 per cent. One
of them has twins and the other triplets. The flock
is not a large one, as you can see, but I would not
mind betting that it is nearly as big as “Sliprail's.”
“Sassafras”: Let me enter my two best
nags for the long-distance jaunt. I rode a full-
blooded brumby (caught on the A. A. Co.’s estate,
near Cooplacurrapa) from the Manning to the Macleay
rivers (N.S.W.), distance 94 miles, taking from
early morn till sunset, and the conveyance finished up
game. He refused corn or hand-feed of any descrip-
tion, and never had a shoe on his feet. He was 16
years old when this happened, and I chased stock
with him long after he had turned 20. The other
competitor was a Blarney mare, well known on the
Northern Rivers of N.S.W. My brother rode her, on
very urgent business, from the Clarence to the Rich-
mond, 87 miles, in the day, and next morning she
had a son and heir that afterwards- turned out a
topnotcher on the track. How is it that the horse
of to-day is so inferior to the horse of 20 years ago
as regards stamina, speed and faithfulness?
* * * *
“Catamain” : I ouce saw a girl of a very
hysterical temperament standing absolutely silent
and motionless, with every muscle rigid, staring into
a tree. She was a perfect imitation of a statue of
Terror. Speaking to her and even a mild shaking
had no effect. Following the direction of her
gaze, I saw a green tree-snake with his eyes fixed on
hers, as motionless and apparently as terrified as the
girl- An obstacle placed in front of her eyes broke
the tension and she immediately went limp and
started to scream. The snake hurried off as fast as
his ancestor did the day that Adam came home un-
expectedly and reached for his gun. “Axehandle”
tells of a mesmerised fowl (B. 4/6/’IG) standing
with wings drooped and beak held to the ground. If
a fowl is held so that its beak is touching some sur-
face and a chalk-line is drawn ahead of it from the
tip of the beak, it will remain for some time rigid
in the same attitude.
“Hay” : A little to the west of Broken
Hill, just inside the South Australian boundary, is a
small, conical hill with a little watercourse running*
down one side of it. To judge from
appearances it was the water which
first exposed a vein of red ochre and
a parallel vein of white material like
kaolin. Even in the early ’7o’s
Binghi had been mining there for
supplies of pigment for very many
years. This ochre mine used to be
visited annually by the blacks from
the Lake Frome district,
and the local or Kill,
parra tribe were very
much afraid of the Pur-
nappa, as they called
their warlike saltwater
visitors, who came very
quietly and dug out as
much red and white clay
as they wanted, and, after
kneading it into damper-
like cakes, took their de-
parture and anything else
they fancied without
meeting any opposition
from the Killparras. Once
when a boy of 17 I was
sent to bring in some
horses, and had to camp
in an Outback hut for
the night not far from
the local blacks’ camp.
Tt was just at the time
iv he n the saltwater
blacks had arrived to
grub out their year’s
supply of warpaint. .Tust
as I was about to put
out the slush-lamp the
door of the hut was
pushed open and in
walked a local gin. She
was trying to explain
that she was afraid of
the Purnappa, when in
strode a warrior about
Oft. high, straight as a
rush, armed with a nulla
and shield, and beauti-
fully dressed in stripes of
red and white clay. He
took no notice of me,
but spoke to the gin in
his own lingo. I picked
up an old shovel and told
them fiercely to get out,
while I quaked inwardly.
They left and shut the
door after them. I kept
it shut by bracing it up witli- everything movable I
could find. At daylight, to my relief, both local
and visiting blacks had departed.
“M.M.”: In answer to inquiries in The
Bulletin' re the word lubra. It belongs to the
dialect spoken by the abos. who had their quarters
on the Lower Murray and at Milang on Lake Alexan-
drina. It was supposed to mean wife only, but I
have heard the gins calling their men lubras. The
tribes who used the word called their place of abode
wurley, and not mia-mia, as in X. S. Wales.
“Sniktaw”: Smut is propagated by spores
from affected black ears becoming attached to the
seed barley. “Pickling” the seed grain is the best
remedy. As germicides “A.G.8.” should try copper
sulphate, ljlb. in 10 gallons of water (immersion for
three minutes), or formalin (40 p.e.) at the rate of
lib. of liquid to 45-50 gallons of water. In the latter
method treat one day and allow the grain to remain
piled up overnight so as to give the fumes time to
get to work. The main point is to see that every
grain is thoroughly wetted, and this is best done by
soaking, not spraying, the solution over a heap of the
grain.
COMPLIMENTS.
THE BORE: “D'yer know, Miss Jean, I passed your place yesterday?"
MISS JEAN : “Oh, thank you.”
THE BORE: “ Aw—what for?”
MISS JEAN: “Why, for passing”
“Baijoe”: If the Abo. court is still hand-
ing out licenses for pubs with quaint names let me
nominate the Green Gate Inn, which stands at the
north-west corner of Orange (N.S.W.). Years ago
it displayed the sign of a green-painted gate with the
legend:—■
This gate hangs well and hinges none,
Refresh and pay and travel on.
“Alex. Outback”: At Burrinjuck dam
(N.S.W.) some good hauls of fish are made at times
in an original way. The fish get fooling about, in
what the teacher of the little school calls “the
immediate vicinity” of the pipes, and are sucked in,
literally as well as figuratively. I have seen incau-
tious cod up to 301 b. in weight thus caught. (N.B. —
Burrinjuck is the place where “Jimmie Pannikin”
Sherlockholmesed the foxes burying hen eggs in the
ploughed-up potato patches for future reference.)
* * * *
“F.H.”: “Hambidge” (B. 1/G/’l6) tells
of his cat’s passion for pickled beetroot. I, too, have
a cat of curious appetites—a black-and-white animal
very much like Souter’s, but of better habits, since
he never comes into the house and listens around.
Cockchafer grubs were plentiful in this district last
year. Whenever I went into the garden to get a
few ounces off by digging a row of potatoes the cat
came with me. Almost' every turnover of the fork
showed one or two grubs—fat, whitey-grey things
about the size of a thumbnail —and not one got
past The Vicar. When I had done my dash and The
Vicar had eaten 6doz. or so, he would stay there by
himself and go on mining for them in the loose
soil. This year, there being but few grubs about, lie
has taken to moths, chasing them in the twilight
and eating ’em, feathers and all.
* * * *
“Miner”: Passing the Pinnacles I met
Potts of Pingin. lie told me I could get water ahead
at an old gold-mine and that there was a haunted
house I could camp in if I liked. Potts likes his
litile joke. At dusk I reached the place, found water
and fixed my horse up comfortably for the night.
The house had a lonely look, so, after all, I decided
to camp near the water. At midnight it started to
rain, so I made for the cottage with my nap, and
entered. As I dropped my blankets I heard a slight
noise from the opposite room and turning quickly
saw something white dart through the doorway bv
which I entered the house. “No good to me,” I said,
and grabbing my kit I transferred to the bough-shed
where my horse was tethered. I was up at daylight,
just in time to see something coming out of the
scrub. It was a man, clad only in a flannel shirt,
and shivering in the morning air. “When did you
come here?” he said. “Last evening,” I answered.
“Did you come into the house about midnight?” “I
did.” “By cripes ! I took you for a ghost,” he said.
I told him he was very silly—there were no such
things as ghosts.

DAN’S MEDICINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
The mildest bloke on Gopher Run
Was little Danny Lauder,
And when the fellows craved for fun
Of an ungodly order
’Twas usual for the smartest man
Their merriment to kindle
By-playing up on simple Dan
A most outrageous swindle.
One night when he was feeling ill
(Some trick the cook had played him),
For medicine a fearful swill
The graceless devils made him.
Painkiller was the base, a tin
Of oil that’s still more risky,
Then aloes, sheepwash, and some gin,
And half a pint of whisky.
They added someone’s hairwash, too,
And tar in weak solution.
Dan took this most infernal brew,
And drank the contribution.
He coughed and turned a trifle red,
But neither kicked nor cursed he.
He passed the cup. “Thanks, boys,” he said,
“Just one dose more— l’m thirsty!”

Symptoms of aWeaK Bladder
A Very Common Complaint with Serious Consequences.
Thousands in Ignorance.
It i? really remarkable bow many people are suffering with bladder trouble, vet do not
know it. X umber less chLdren are suffering with weak bladders, and their parents do not
know it. thinking all the time that the child is naughty. T 1 is is wrong. But there is an
even greater number of men and women, both old and young, who are suffering with bladder
trouble. They know there is something wroi g. but what it is thev cannot tell.
Just rea the>e symptoms through, and see if any of them apply to you:—Nasty taste in
the mouth. Had complexion, scanty urine, restlessness at night, continual thirst, pains in the
groin with a burning sensation inside, inability to retain urine (bed-wetting), stone or gravel
in the bladder, too frequent desire to urinate, bri k-dust or sediment in the urine, and an
irritable temper.
If you have any of toe-, symptom- you should not negleot them, because if vou do vou
will find that instead of curing itself your Madder trouble will get worse. It lias never been
known for a case of bladder disc; h? to cure i:se !:. It almo-t invariable develops. Slisrht
paius may develop into chronic rheumatism at gout. A little darkness under the eves mav
develop into drops: a! swellings. Cloudy urine may develop into gravel and gravel into stone.
Never neglect bladder trouble no matter how slight.
DANGER IN DELAY.
If you are experiencing any bladder or kidney trouble of any kind do not wait until some
severe and dangerous urinary or kidney complaint has obtained a foothold, but act in time
take De Witts Kidney and Bladder Pi.ls. and see what they will do for vou. Being anti-
septic and soothing, me effect on the delicate tissues is most grateful, and as they assist the
kidneys in passing the uric-acid poison from the system, this prolific source of bodily torture
is quickly but surely removed. When the kidneys and bladder are restored, and can pass off
this poison themselves, the trouble will, of course, disappear—the dragging pains will leave,
the joints cease aching, and the delicate organs will become soothed m their irritated and
inflamed parts. Then yon really will be surprised how different all the world will seem to
you. Instead of drudgery, your household duties will become a pleasure, life will be brighter
you will be brighter and happier, and so will those with whom you come in contact.
Many remedies claim to cure, and do, without doubt, give relief for a time, but the one remedv
which will give you quick relief, and most probably a permanent cure, is De Witt's Kidnev and
Bladder Pills, for when once cured by these wonderful little pills, our readers sav they are cured for
?ver. And yet they are so gentle in action that babies may take them. Thev will cure vou. no matter how old v
are.

The Vie. Railways Department has had
another interesting sale of unclaimed goods.
There was the usual large supply if trunks,
"ports." rugs and handbags, with gamps
galore and small goods too numerous to
mention. A few marquises had also left their
matildas behind iu their hurry to hit the
track again. But the most remarkable items
were a tip-dray and a 400-gallon tank. How
they happened to be left behind in the lug-
gage-rack the speculators who attend these
sales didn’t trouble to find ouu being too
busy at the moment trying t. • jnck up 50s.
worth of something else for 15s.
"Quidain”: If anyone-could find a profit-
able use for bracken fern he would soon be
able to afford nieat for breakfast. It is said
by some people to improve the laud for culti-
vation. and possibly it may. but it is such a
curse to get rid of that the improvement is
often more' than offset by the expense
of achieving it. Nothing, not even the
rabbit, appears to eat bracken: consequently
it increases continually, and countless acres
that formerly carried good grass are now
covered with it. In Gippsland and else-
where it is cut down with scrub hooks at a
cost of about ss. an acre, but as it takes
three cuttings before the roots die the clear-
ing runs to about 15s. an acre, and much of
the land it frequents in the Blue Mountains
is not worth that, though the aggregate value
is a large sum. It forms the best of harbors
for rabbits, snakes, rats and other pests, and
affords splendid material for bush fires,
which, while consuming its upper portion,
together with fences, crops, sheep and other
brie-a-br&e, only urge the roots to more
vigorous efforts.
* * * *
"Nym”: A new industry has been started
in the Wangaratta (Vic.) district, where
natural frog farms abound in the swamps
and billabongs adjacent to the Ovens and
King rivers. As the result of a demand by
Melbourne University for 500 frogs, fresh
and frisky, at 2ld. each, boys have been
doing brisk business for the local Red Cross
funds. Dunno what the frogs are wanted
for. but I’ve got a suspicion it won’t meet
with their approval.
* * ■» *
"Briner": Barraeouta is decidedly most
inferior sea-fish for eating. Yet the Port-
land (Vic-.) Freezing Works have just begun
tinning it. and the finished article is excel-
lent. Chief Inspector of Fisheries Lewis
joins in praise of the toothsome transforma-
tion. for which I predict a big demand when
the lean days arrive. But why can’t we
use our canneries on the rock cod,
which is better when smoked than any im-
i*ort? Our pilchards, too. are identical with
the valued Fx-ench sardine and much
superior to the Norwegian sprat which the
Australia grocer shoves over the counter.
We are nearer a meat famine than ever we
were, and now’s the time to push these sea-
ii-dustries of our-.
"0.W.": The Labor party was going to
run the savings banks differently when it
got into power; but the same old cumber-
some. inconvenient, out-of-date ideas still
prevail. To hank or withdraw one must
produce the passbook, and depositors are
expressly warned that as no other receipt
is given it should be kept under lock and
key. If anyone wishes to deposit money in
a private bank to a depositor’s credit, all he
has to do is to walk iu and do it, and he
can show the depositor the deposit siip
later as proof. Whether he does so or not
the fact will be duly recorded in the depo-
sitor’s passbook at any time he cares to
take it to the bank. But to make a deposit
in a savings hank to Smith’s credit, one
must first obtain Smith's passbook, thereby
receiving definite information as to his
financial standing with the institution. If
the passbook is not returned by the bor-
rower. the owner will probably go broke or
mad while wrestling with the red tape that
ties his money up. The same intallible
methods for creating trouble and profanity
prevail in regard to withdrawals also, and
if one is any distance from a savings bank
the trouble is multiplied.

“Sparrowhawk”: Keat's gentleman who
for the inconvenience of other people "set
sharp racks at work to pinch and peel,”
would cordially approve of au ingenious
device which has sprung full-armed from the
brain of -Webster, machine-made P.M.G. For
a moderate charge, never to be less than a
tanner, a telephone subscriber may engage
Central to transmit, “not less frequently than
once very hour,” a message to any other
subscriber who may be out of call at the
first time of asking. This means that Cen-
tral will ring every hour for 24 hours—
if it does not get its victim sooner or “unless
special circumstances warrant an extension
of this time." Therefore I have only to wait
until I know that the head of a family whose
every member I detest is away week-ending
to pay my sixpence on pretext of communi-
cating with him alone. He being of course
out of call Central will automatically give
that family Hell at intervals for 24 hours,
"unless special circumstances,” etc-. The In-
quisition. the Vehmgeric-ht. and the Council
of Ten are Mothers’ Guilds compared with
the I’.M.G.'s department.

“Maori”: There has been a paper mill
on the Mataura Falls (M.L.) for over 30
years. In the beginning the works had a
chequered career, when various fibres were
being tested, and only rough brown paper
was turned out. largely from old cornsac-ks.
Now. they produce wrapping and printers’
and fine writing paper from local material.
Old sacks and bag stuffs of all grades are
purchased from merchants and farmers, and
a very important material used is a native
tussock called "snow grass." a reedy vege-
tation 3ft. to 4ft. in length, and of the
same botanical class as the bunchy tuss. >ck
that grows so abundantly on the Millic-ent,
Tantanoola and Rendelsham flats in S. Aus.
With 'the material at hand c-an’t we ask the
Maorilanders how to do the rest:
* * * *
There is a c-o. in Adelaide —the Austral —
making the best plaster of paris. Before
the German went mad Australia imported
its plaster from U.S.A. and Ilunville —
mostly Ilunville. The Adelaide people saw
Australia’s chance and jumped in: and,
having overcome the early technical diffi-
culties of manufacture, they are now busy
breaking down prejudice against locally-
made goids. Fortunately the plaster itself
has been helping them, so the works at
Port Adelaide are getting plenty to do. The
raw material is mostly gypsum, and there is
plenty of tbat of first-rate quality.

"Hampden": Potato digging is ranked
among the unskilled industries. but there
is much more in it than meets the eye. An
experienced artist dips the fork in. and
apparently without any trouble at all
throws a large section of earth in front of
him in such a way that Australia falls
underneath, and the potatoes on top. Hav-
ing given a couple of scratches in the
cavity to secure any lost, stolen or stray
spuds, he does it again, and in a minute or
two has several drills neatly spread on top
of the ground. They are then picked
into kerosene tins, and placed in baes
large and small being kept separate. Them
retically it all seems as simple as sin Rut
let the newehum try, and he will find that
the wretched spuds always have a habit of
growing outside the large portion of
tralian earth his fork casts forth—alwavs
except two or three large ones, which im
pale themselves on the fork. Unfortunately"
bayonetting potatoes is not regarded bv the
profession as good practice, and the' boss
blames you for it. Personally I am in
dined to think that suicidal tendencies are
terribly prevalent among potatoes. I have
also observed that a large amount of hard
labor is necessary to properly expel all the
potatoes from each dug-out. The remark
able persistency with which they can
remain in a burrow is a matter that calls
for scientific explanation, and partly ex-
plains why, after I have smoothed out the
kinks in my spine and recuperated suffi-
ciently to walk home, I find that I have
filled three bags while other experts have
done 13.

“Third Brigade”: Re employment of giant
gravel pump for trench warfare IB
20/1/T6). It would be a kindness to warn
the inventor not to waste too much time or
money on it, as I submitted the same pro-
l>osal to the War Office some months ago
Perhaps if the inventor came over here and
actually saw the trenches he might evolve
some other scheme more quickly than I
I spent six months gazing at the Turks
before I thought of it.
An unreasonable legal tradition has been
knocked on the head by the Supreme Court
of South Aus. Iu a judgment carrying
interest counsel asked to have it reckoned
at S per cent. —"the rate which it has been
the practice of the Court to allow.” There
seemed to be no excuse for it except tradi-
tion. and after a little argument the claim
was reduced to six. The other side said
that four is allowed in England, and five
might be a fair thing here. Judge Gordon,
having poor respect for bad tradition
allowed 51.

A SHORT DISCOIRSE CONCERNING THOSE
THINGS WHICH ARE TRULY EVERLASTING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
Nations may fall and empires wane
And faith and freedom pass away.
Flesh may return to dust again
Ami cities crumble to decay,
The weariest prophets cease to wail.
The truest lovers break their vows,
Crops, students, health and merchants fail;
But somebody must milk the cows.
Hearts, cups and banks alike may break;
Live-, trains and trinkets may be lost:
Corns and bad debts combined may ntake
Existence something of a frost;
Age may come creeping on apace,
While care no peace of mind allows,
And eaeh year leave ji- less of grace,
But still we can't escape the cows.
Youth is but as a dream that Pees.
Joy is at best a transient boon.
And, still less permanent ihan thrse.
Our hair and teeth go all too soon.
Each little dog has but his day
Ami then to fate’s fell mandate bows,
But what untimely fate can stay
The immortality of cows.
Though r.-es droop ami violets die
Ami even dandelions fade.
Though nothing mortal may defy
The edge of Time's il.i'e.
Though all our human pride is is in
At length in lowly clay to house,
Serene and hearty still remain
Tfcote blanky everlasting cows.

COLD TEA FOR MA!
[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
The Iced is done! Ours is the shock!
Confound Cold Tea’s brown tricks!
r T«- Freedom shrieked for Nine O’clock,
While Slav’ry yelled ior Six!
Three thousand of Beer's Prussian Guard
Marked down Eleven! They
Were cm to pieces. It was hard
To see them swept away.
The Ten Brigade, the Nine Brigade,
Went down like Seven and Eight
Before the desert tribes arrayed
In tannin and in Hate!
Faith’s barrels burst before their spears;
The greedy sands drank deep
Of alcohol, and barmaids’ tears,
And stuff Drink’s stalwarts weep.
The hordes of Tea swept on like mad,
And no more could be done;
Though Freedom shrieked in bar and ad.,
Twas Sis and Slav'ry won!

their physician. Chapters are devoted to innumerable inter-
esting subjects concerning marriage, which makes it a very
superior guide to the action of men and women both in and
out of marriage. No man or woman who anticipates a bright
future, and wishes to enjoy married life in its fullest sense,

CHAMPION CURE of the WORLD
for BLEEDING PILES. Estab. 1891.
AN AFTtli-UINNER PILL.
Most people eat too much If you are a
hearty eater help your digestion, take care
of the over-load by taking one Pinkette, the
little sugar-coated laxative ovals, after a big
dinner. Pinkettes gently stimulate the
stomach, prevent congestion and the many
distressing results of over-indulgence at the
table.
Pinkettes, the new laxative, are greatly
superior to old-fashioned medicines which
over-stimulate the liver and, when their use
is stopped, leave it more torpid than before.
Pinkettes do not upset the stomach or cause
griping.
Pinkettes should be in every household.
Do not wait until you need to take them;
buy a bottle now. If your chemist cannot
supply you send Is. to the Dr. Williams’
Medicine Co., Sydney, for a full sized bottle ;
or send your name and address, mentioning
TflE Bulletin, and a free sample will be
sent to you.— Advt.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Are the two main political parties going
to change places altogether? Not three
years ago the Laborites had no time for
trusts, combines and pools. They were the
great thieves of the commercial world. Up
to the very moment when war broke out
“Billy” Hughes was yelling at the top of his
voice for power to deal with monopolies.
Since then William has spent a lot of time
fixing up a metal ring; and now Tudor, Min-
ister for Customs, asked by the Tasmanian
hop-growers for a duty, has recommended
them to form a pool instead.
WINTRY.
HE: “No, I don’t drive my car during war
time; I always walk.”
SHE: “I see —trying to get your feet warm.”
This month McGowen, Cann, Edden and
Nicholson will complete their 25 years’ ser-
vice in the N.S.W. Assembly. They were
all elected as Labor members, and how
successful they have been in releasing the
worker from the yoke of the capitalist may
be judged from the fact that to-day the
State is paying interest to the moneylender
on £130,000,000, whereas 25 years ago the
debt to Cohen was only £67,000,000.
“Uncle James”: Those who talk about
“no conscription of life without conscrip-
tion of wealth” miss one all-important point.
In the case of the man, whether rich or poor,
who returns from the Front, his life has not
been conscripted. The authors of the above
cry, to be logical, should during the war call
for the conscription of men and of all in-
terest derived from property, and should,
when the war is over and the conscripted
men are set free, call upon the Government
to levy no taxes, but only to accept what is
given them voluntarily by the more patriotic
of its citizens.
There is nothing for it but to hang Trivett,
the N. S. Wales Government Statistician. At
the very moment when he ought to be show-
ing that the enormous loans of the Labor
Ministry have been so well spent that the
surplus profit has reduced taxation, the
absurd man issues a table to show that
N. S. Wales State taxation has increased
from 15s. 7d. per head in 1911 to £1 14s. 10? d.
per head in 1915. The progress in the last
three years has been as follows: —1913,
19s. 2d.; 1914, £1 Bs. 9Jd.; 1915, £1 14s. 10M.
The Government is getting such wretched
value for the millions it is spending that the
works simply can’t earn their own interest;
and ; that means increased taxation to make
good the deficit.
Maoriland's Premier stumbled against a
large-sized truth the other day. There was
a local yell about shortage of paper, and
someone remarked that to make matters
worse the supply for Hansard was running
out. “No matter,” said Massey, “we would
be better without it.” The thing represents
a wicked waste of public money—this labori-
ous reporting and publication of miles of
blither. In Maoriland every member of the
Legislature gets 75 copies of the wretched
issue free, and the Post Office carries the
stuff gratis all over the country. The cost
runs into thousands' a year, and the. only
people who read Hansard are politicians
looking for something old to dig up against
an enemy and hayseeds anxious to discover
if their member is battling hard enough for
that culvert he promised. ,
Last week the Commonwealth Government
turned in its sleep and remembered that it
already had a Compulsory Service Act on
the premises. In 1909, the first Fisher Gov-
ernment being in power, universal service
was such a ..democratic thing that the Labor
party took all the credit which it earned for
passing the principle into Law. Since then,
however, the occasion for service has actu-
ally arisen, and a lot of the people who were
prepared to make political capital out of the
party’s action have suddenly discovered that
universal service is a shamefully undemo-
cratic thing. This leaves a nasty taste in
the mouth, suggesting that, at rock-bottom,
what some people object to isn’t conscrip-
tion, but the personal inconvenience of being
shot at.
From an interview with Admiral Mat-
sumura, in command of the Jap warships
which have just visited Sydney: —
“Japan is not looking for open spaces, except in
regard to trade. Her people are happy, and there
is plenty of room for them to expand in Korea, in
Manchuria and in Formosa. Saghalien is too cold,
and the Pacific islands are too hot.. So long as
there is peace, and so long as civilisation, with its
peaceful avenhes of trade, is not threatened, Japan
will be satisfied. The Japanese do not want to
settle in America, in Australia, or in any other
country in large numbers —we want to keep our
own people in Japan. Australia,” the Admiral
remarked, with a shrug and a smile, “is too expen-
sive.”
That is just it. It is not because of any dis-
like or any discourtesy that Australia says:
“We must protect ourselves with a heavy
Customs duty—against Japan as well as
others.” It is because Australia is “too ex-
pensive” : the cost of living is so high that
without that protection there can be no hope
of local manufacture. So Japan may under-
stand many things which hitherto may have
seemed to her mere offensiveness.
Our soldiers have been great, but our poli-
ticians are splendid. How they battle for
the Empire in its hour of trial and call on
every citizen to put his right leg foremost
that victory may be achieved! Look, for
instance, at Holman pleading with J". Bull
not to be downcast, but to lend him a few
millions that triumph may be secured to our
arms by continuing the beneficent works of
peace at Condobolin and Cootamundra. And
Hughes—backwoodsman and boundary-
rider —is helping the weary Atlas to carry
the too vast orb by negotiating another
loan. And Ryan, of Bananaland, whose
patriotism shines through the clouds of
battle and lights the path of progress
towards Liberty. There are no pettifogging
ideas about Ryan. He sees things in a big
way. “Let me have a few millions,” he says,
in the simple language of Australia. “Let
me build more railways, so that no one who
votes for me need be without a job while the
money lasts.”
There is talk of a peerage for one English
gentleman who has made half a million out
of explosives. Who says the profits have no
honor in their own country?
According to Knibbs 1,301,000 days’ work
was lost through strikes in N. S. Wales
alone during 1934 and 10i5. The result, so
far as the State is concerned, is exactly the
same as if the Government took 3565 men
out of employment and kept them and their
families in complete idleness for a year,
maintaining them out of the nublic funds.
In that fact lies the State’s complete justifi-
cation for declaring strikes illegal and pun-
ishing the striker.
TOO MUCH HOSPITALITY.
“And did you men meet with much hospi-
tality in Egypt?”
"Faith, too much aw it! I teas in one ward
or another nearly all me toime.”
The strength of the Westralian Parliamen-
tary Labor party lies in the nine pocket
boroughs representing the faded and fading
goldfields of Coolgardie, Cue, Kanowna,
Menzies, Leonora, Mt. Magnet, Mt. Mar-
garet, Murchison and Yilgarn. The rolls for
this group show a total voting strength of
14,276, or an average of just under 1600
per member. Even this is flattering, as there
has been a steady exodus since the last com-
pilation of rolls. The metropolitan area has
12 representatives for 70,200 electors, while
the agricultural districts and Golden Mile
average between 3000 and 4200 votes per
member. The situation demands a Redistri-
bution Bill. While conditions like this pre-
vail one man one vote is a mockery. The
anomaly is that a Redistribution Bill re-
quires an absolute majority of the House;
which is like putting the accusedrin the jury-
box. The redistribution should of course be
automatic, and the House should have
nothing to do with it.
The Westralian Labor Congress, recently
concluded at Kalgoorlie, kept the “hostile
press” outside the door, but the official sum-
mary revealed that the position of the State
trading enterprises gave some of the dele-
gates sinking feeling. Works Minister
Angwin pleaded patheticallv for more work
for the wages,the State paid. In the imple-
ment works alone the Government paid £3OOO
a year for holidays, he said ; and the brick-
works had closed down the previous week
because the men had struck for higher wages
when the Government was already up against
a mountainous deficit. Of course, the Con-
ference couldn’t pledge the men to put more
ginger' into it; all it could say was that,
ginger or no ginger, deficit or surplus, the
State should go on extending the system of
nationalisation, even to the carving of emu
eggs and the manufacture of babies’ com-
forters.
There was really no need for the “econ-
omy” circular issued to Commonwealth de-
partments by the Acting- Prime Minister.
Federal and State Ministries have for a
long time been convinced that the affairs of
Australia are administered with the greatest
care, the outlay of every Id. being carefully
examined by multitudinous officials. Any-
how, thev have frequently said so. The
Defence Department, for instance, has got
full value for the millions it has spent this
last couple of years. Also there has been no
waste at Canberra or in the Post Office. In
addition to all this conservation of funds
there are the further examples of prudence,
not to say parsimony, afforded by seven
Cocked Hats, fourteen Houses, 800" M’s.P.
and multitudinous flunkeys. As long as Aus-
tralia has these, the population can be satis-
fied that the politicians are keeping an eye
on the pence and officialdom is watching the
pounds.

held a very good exhibition of Tas

it was noticeable that many lines
didnt carry anything to show that
they were made on the spot. That

else to do —between the Australian

Australian stuff which is prepared to
deny its master and masquerade as any old
thing, to choose the former every time.
It is announced that, the P.L.L. Execu-

port conscription. Gardiner, assistant-Mini-
ster of Defence, has had an interview with
the body, “and it is expected that the final
decision of the executive will be largely
governed by consideration of the facts which
Mr. Gardiner communicated.” Now when is
Mr. Gardiner going to address the Baptist
Union and the Dog and Poultry Society? If
it is necessary to nave certain confidential
facts in order to come to a proper conclu-
sion, one lot is just as much entitled to them
as the other. Why, then, does Gardiner
give them to one and not to the other? If a
Government makes confidential statements
to bodies which are its political friends, the
corollary, of course, is to impose the censor-
ship only upon its political enemies—on the
ground, apparently taken up by this Govern-
ment, that its friends outside Parliament
are entitled to know the facts and its
enemies outside Parliament are not.

that without wars the human race would speedily
degenerate. It is by war that the virtues of courage

In enervating times of peace
The miners go below ;
To give the eager world increase
The farmer wields his hoe;
And unknown hills the seekers tread
In everlasting quest of bread.
These face the warring elements,
Browbeat the" blazing sun,
Or pitch their thousand tiny tents
- Where ice-gift waters run ; t.
By forge and bench they strive, and yet
The world is quickened with their sweat.
But ’tis not so that men are made.
If left to peaceful shifts
The race must pass, a thing afraid,
On custom’s turgid drifts.
Not toil’s incessant pangs can give
The vital force, the will to live.
I see on far-stretched, tortured fields
A million mangled sons;
And still a mad-eyed monarch wields
The devastating guns.
I must applaud, though hearts be breaking,
For here is mankind in the making!

NOTIONS
Weights for the A.J.C. Epsom and Metro-
politan and for Melbourne and Caulfield Cups came
out on Tuesday. The rest is easy; all punters have
to do is to pick the winners and book them straight
out and in doubles and trebles with the long-suffering
Mac Moses. Then they can lay back in peace and
comfort and wait for settling-day—or the scratching
pen, or the crook leg, or anything else that matters.
Meanwhile there is an easy chance to make a
hatful by having a dream, and for anyone who hap-
pens not to be acquainted with all the nags engaged
there is always the illumination of the “training
notes” in the daily papers to show how things are
going. In the Epsom the fiying Woorak heads the
list with lOst. 41b., and has earned every pound of
the burden, for he is a miler of rare brilliancy, and
if the race were run on his day and the wav he likes
it the tonnage would not stop him. The little fellow
also stands top in the Metropolitan, but whether he
deserves that is another matter. The position in
these handicaps of Wallace Isinglass, the Spring
failure, is a bit strange. What did he ever do de-
manding that he should give weight over two miles
to Green Cap and be handicapped within 21b. of
Marculfus and lib. of Prince Bardolph? In the
Metropolitan Wallace Isinglass is weighted to be
lib. worse over a mile and a half than Kingsburgh ;
in the Caulfield Cup the estimate is that over this
distance the 4-year-old will be 81b. the better. The
weight-adjusters have taken no risks, anyhow, with
Wallalo, who has been apDortioned Bst. 61b. tor
each of the Cups and 9st. 31b. for the Metropolitan.
The return of this holiday-maker to the track will
be one of the interesting events of the season if he
is saddled up well. Also the handicapper has
reckoned it was up to him to keep an eye on the
imported Redfern, and for the Melbourne Cup has
handed him 9st. 61b., which is a fairly substantial
helping-.
Punters who rushed in early to back their
Grand National fancies, singly or in doubles, have
had more shocks than usual this year. Some of
them picked Grand Fleet for the Hurdle before the
weights appeared, but as soon as his list. 131 b. was
published he was scratched. The Maoriland horse,
Morning, had been talked of, but both horse and
trainer were dead and gone before the handicap came
to light. El Gallo, also of Maoriland, had a crowd
of fervent admirers, who said he was good enough
to win either Hurdle or Steeole, and particularly
tipned him for the Hurdle. He was scratched for
both events more than a week ago. Tim Doolan,
another Maorilander, who ran second for the Steeple
last vear, looked a very promising candidate —until
he lamed himself at Caulfield. The popular Booligal,
always a rheumatic subject, is showing new signs of
his old complaint; and three early fancies for the
G. N. Hurdle Race, Eishon. Von Homreigh and Sir
Prjm. went back in the market as the result of their
form subsequent to the weights coming out. . Of the
original favorites Jullunder (for the Hurdle) is about
the only one that has gained new friends within the
past three weeks.
* * * *
The next two Saturdays and the Wednes-
dav that comes between are Grand National w T eek at
Flemington, when the punter’s heart is in his mouth
every time his dead-bird rises at a fence, and in his
boots when it comes a cropper. The Hurdle Race
on this Saturday is not much less open to heated dis-
cussion than it was a week ago when Beccassine, Sir
Prim and others were mentioned in The Bulletin.
Si rice then Beccassine has won a Maiden Hurdle Race
at Williamstown, and if he can go three miles he
should win the big event'. Two years ago, when
Clpntaft -got home, and Lord Grey finished second,
thd running for 21 miles was made by Bill Brandon,
Beccassine and Sir Prim. Two of these pace-
makers aforesaid are likely starters for this year’s
National on almost the same terms as before. Bill
B. was an old stager in 1914, but Beccassine was a
mere youngster at the game. Both of them will
meet Lord Grey on better terms. The writer reckons
that Bee. is a better chance at the price than, say,
Jullundur, Merrimax, Hypo, Shot Out, Strifeness, Wis-
consin, Jack Rice and a dozen other possibilities. At
any rate, the good-looking son of Bobadil has a win-
some weight—9st. 61b.
* * * *
/The ancient steeplechase glories of Bulla-
w&rra were revived at Williamstown on Saturday. It
was his first reappearance in Australia after a lapse
of nearly three years, and the old champion, with
12st. 131 b. on his back, beat a moderate field hand-
somely. He may be even equal to the job of beating
Booligal and co. in the G. N. Steeple.
* * * *
The imported animal continues to leap
past the post first. Medley is the latest offender,
and it happened at Rosehill (Sydney) on Saturday
in the Rydalmere Mile after the books had been
frantically yelling 12 to 1. Medley was sent to. this
part of the world last year by ex-Australian trainer-
owner Dick Wootton, and has earned his oats. Vic-
toria Park trainer Tomlinson owns him, and since
the acquisition has won three races. Two of them
were at fixtures outside the 25-miles radius, and
hard-working pilot Lilyman was on top each time.
Tomlinson has had nothing good to feed since
Nuwara Eliza was given up as hopeless. That parti-
cular horse was always threatening to do things on a
big scale, but usually declined to carry out the
promise.
* * * *
Bookmaker Lou Abrahams had a turn of
luck at Rosehill on Saturday when his four-vear-old
gelding Lord Linnet annexed the Flying Welter. The
titled nag had been filling places with such con-
sistency that he became the desoair of the people
behind him. Not long ago Lord Linnet was regarded
as being essentially a sprinter, but somebody with a
say in the matter had a brain-wave which led him to
the conclusion that a bit of"distance was the prad’s
game. The inspiration was just short of being
correct, as Lord Linnet always found the last furlong
beyond him. That fact must have been responsible
for the horsfe starting at 14 to 1 on Saturday in the
six furlongs. He just scrambled home bv half a
neck. Abrahams is also the proprietor of Willow
Green and one or two others which are not nearly in
the same class.
* * * «
The day has gone when Billy McLachlan
had only to throw a leg over a racehorse for the nag
to be rushed by a confident populace imploring the
Bags to take their cash for a few minutes. He
doesn’t ride much these days, probably because —
well, out Randwick way there is a long string of
cottages each bearing the name of a horse which at
one time or other won a Cup in various parts of Aus-
tralia. But he had a ride at Rosehill (Sydney) on
Saturday and kicked Duckie along so fast in the
straight in the Granville Stakes that the filly had
two lengths to spare at the finish. The onlookers
cheer must have sounded like a voice from the long
ago to McLachlan. Wonder how much cheer
there would have been had Duckie been an out-
sider instead of favorite. Anyhow, Christian Moses
was not observed waving his hat.
* * * *
The Rosehill Jockey Club (Sydney) has
abandoned the theory that its course is wide enough
to accommodate a field of any size, . and in. future
when over 28 animals insist on having a go they
will be cut into two divisions. The number looks
excessive. Anyhow, why not leave the cash in one
lump and ballot the superfluous prads out?
* * * *
One of the new V.R.C. betting rules
simplifies a tangle which has bothered the betting
public for a long time: —“All place bets are (a) 1,
2,3, if there are eight or more starters; and (b)
1, 2, if there are seven starters or under. The odds
under (a) to be one-fourtli, and under (b) one-third
of the odds for a straight-out win.” Although some
bookmakers have paid these rates, the punter has in
the majority of cases been obliged to accept what-
ever the other side would disgorge. The fact that
starting-price odds are to be those of Melbourne
A rous helps to further clear the mist.
* * * *
Australian-born nags will have to hurry
up after the cash this spring-time, because there
will be a lot of strangers on the job and there may
soon be less to hurry up for. The English-bred
animal is getting ready in droves, and it looks as if
the Maori landers’ invasion may be considerable.
Trainers Mason and Quinlivan are coming oyer
with a bunch, and as a rule they have something
that can move with reasonable rapidity.

It was mentioned on this page recently
that the old-time jockey Paddy Pigott, who rode
Chester in the Melbourne Cun and V.R.C. Derby, had
gone into Brisbane Hospital with an injured foot.
Since then Paddy has lost one of his stirrups for good.
The foot has been removed.

At the recent meeting of the Bowen River
(Q.) Turf Club there were 14 events in the two days,
and A. W. H. Cunningham, of Strathmore station,
annexed nine of them right out, participated in a
dead heat, and had two seconds and a third. He
was after his last year’s- record when he won the
whole programme.
HARRY STONE,
Yankee pvg.
Heaven knows what was happening on
the premises, but a Brisbane paper the other day
burst out with the weights for the Casino races as
results. It looked all right, and top-weights never
had such a time before.
* * * *
Ivalgoorlie and Boulder Racing Clubs
(W.A.) have been having a rough time since the
war, mainly because two proprietary clubs there-
abouts run alternate weekly meetings all the year
round. When the time arrives for the registered
meetings most of the local cash has gone into hid-
ing. So, with a view to making something break,
the big clubs are going to start monthly programmes
and hand the profits over to soldiers’ relief funds.
Even if this arrangement doesn't break one or other
of the clubs, the public may be expected to go
bung, anyhow.
* * * *
The Peacock Ministry’s intention to further
reduce the number of days of racing in the Cabbage
Garden, particularly the threat to cut down trotting
from 20 to 10 days a year, brought a note of protest
from Melbourne’s one-time, but now almost forgotten,
music-hall favorite Billy Whitburn. William dwells
now at Clayton, beyond Oakleigh, on a small
“estate,” of which part is a training ground. His growl
was that the trotting horse is more useful to the
country than the galloper, and to cut any off the 20
days now allowed him to run is to practically wipe
him out. Which is probably true.
* * * *
Apropos a recent Bulletin par. about a
four-furlongs dash at Rosehill (Sydney) in the long
ago, in which a pony named Sambo played a prom-
inent part, the following, dug from a paper of June,
’92, is evidence that things were rather more raw
once than they are to-day: “About one of the coolest
pieces of business that I ever saw or heard of took
place over a pony race at Botany last Mondav. There
were six starters for the Bunnerong Handicap, a
pony called Sambo going out at evens. Getting
well away, Sambo had everything hopelessly beaten
at the end of the first furlong, and from that to the
finish it was 100 to one on him. Despite his long
lead, however, several of the bookmakers could be
heard offering odds against him, and this was the
case when he was 50 yards in front, and only a
furlong to go. Directly Sambo passed the post
these same men could be heard offering to take two
to one he was short weight. The rider, on weigh-
ing in, was found to be 81b. short weight, though
he weighed out correct. It is needless to say that
owner and pony were disqualified, the rider escap-
ing, as he, according to evidence, was in no way
guilty. That the weight had been purposely ex-
tracted was clearly shown by the bookmakers openly
offering to bet. Compared with such men, Ben
Hall and Gilbert were gentlemen.”
* * * *
‘Sol”: Wlmt is the use of blaming
trainers because a lot of the yearlings handed over
to them turn out failures? Owners send the animals
in to be trained, and trained they have to be. If a
man refuses to take them he loses hls face
Owners know the risks they are running. They face
them. They lose their cash or their horses, but that
is their business. Take any of the leading Uaineis
and look at the good horses they have turned out as
proof that they know their job.
To which this paper replies that the fact that a
man has turned out a good horse occasionally does
not show that he knows his job. The essential thing
to know is how many horses he has murdered, and
it was to get at this that The Bulletin suggested
an expansion of rating statistics. That, taking the
thing by and large, horses are murdered in the
training stables is absolutely certain, and in conse-
quence many of the supposed “facts relating to
breeding in Australia are wholly lllusionarv. the
racing of two-vear-olds is so excessive as to be a
scandal, if the matter is viewed from the horseflesh
point of view as distinct from that of breeders,
whose business is to make money by selling youngsters.
The question of trainers having to take the annual
crop of immature nags and prepare them has nothing
to do with the point at issue—whether the existing
system of training babies does not result in all-round
disaster to a huge percentage of animals. How many
of the two-year-olds raced all through the late season
will be worth anything? How many of the 20-
months-old foals in training with a view to the
spring will last? It is all sheer recklessness from
end to end. Owners are pitching money and horses
away, and trainers are wasting their talents —-those
who have any. And with the plentiful numbei
of track failures, combined with the excessive quan-
tity of subsequent stud failures, the truth has become
obvious to a lot of people.

“Flarrison O.”: Of all the gee-gees in this
world —brown, chestnut, piebald, black —how is it
that the best bv far, the surest and the swiftest
are the ones I do not back? The matter long has
worried me, and in the stilly night I lie awake and
think it o’er, and in the afternoon once more I
strive to set it right. But though I get the best of
tips and information straight from stable sources all
my schemes for making coin go wrong ; it seems I’m
doomed to such a fate. Nags that as “dead birds
are described more oft are merely “dead” ; for e’en
the quick are “dead” at times in racing (curse
these frequent rhymes!)—thus punters are misled.
A horse kept “dark” may be a nark, and “sports”
have pawned their pants to back “dark horses”
which, alas! have proved white elephants. Some
nags that start at 2 to 1 don’t finish till two past
for verily to you I say: The first are often last.
Since Moses makes the laws which we poor sinners
must obey it matters not how our vote goes ; though
we may favor “ayes” or “noes,” the Nose will win
the day.

There is one horse-owner in England,
always near the top of the list of winners, who
seemingly is going to romp in this season. This is
Edward Hulton, for whom Australian R. Wootton
used to train. He has already appropriated the two
big classics, the Derby and Oaks, with Fifinella, and
recently collared the handicap which has been sub-
stituted for the very popular Ascot Royal Hunt Cup
—usually one of England’s biggest betting races.
Its war-time title is the Cambridgeshire Hunt Plate,
and Hulton’s four-year-old Silver Tag, a half-sister
to Fifinella, was the winner. Hulton is a Lancashire
man who made his money in the printing and news-
paper business. His firm owns the Manchester
Chronicle, originally a Sunday paper, now published
daily—also a winner from the jump. Hulton started
business in London a few years ago and runs a
daily illustrated paper in opposition to the North-
cliffe firm. As it never rains but it pours, that
also makes enough money for its owner to enable
him to have a little bit on his “good things” occa-
sionally.

Dave Smith interviewed Les Darcy at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday, and in the twelfth
collision caught a long hook on the chin, groped
wildly for the glove that stung him, and was dropped
by a hard right to the jaw. At no stage of the pro-
ceedings did Smith look like a winner, and it is
doubtful if he ever felt like one. Still he boxed
very well —at times brilliantly—but it was a rear-
guard action nearlv all the way. At the seventh
episode Smith began to weaken and hold on, spark-
ling up at times for brief countering efforts. He was
very tired when the end came. Darcy made few
attempts to box his opponent. He spent most of the
time looking for a chance to make a fight of it.
Smith has returned to the ring as good as ever he
was, and judiciously matched has it in him to do a
lot of damage yet. His next controversy is with Mr.
Buck Crouse (U.S.A.), and in that argument there
ought to be something really strenuous.
* * * *
Australia’s two top-notch feathers —Jimmy
Hill (N.S.W.) and Bert Spargo (Vic.) —will be
blown together by the force of circumstance at Syd-
ney on Saturday t& decide a trifling unpleasantness
which had not been settled by the referee at their
last meeting, when a verdict was given to Hill on a
foul. On that occasion Spargo seemed to have the
upper-hand until he made a mistake through excessive
eagerness. They are two very fine boxers, and can be
relied on to do what the imported article frequently
doesn’t. This paper has an idea that Jimmy will
have a busy evening.
* * * *
Though he had an advantage of 111 b.
thrown in it was a bewildered Mick King that faced
Fred Kay at Melbourne on Saturday night. King
would have been more at home with a streak of
lightning. Kay frequently stood sideways and belted
his left seriously into Michael’s forage department.
At other times he varied the unpleasantness with
rights to the chivvy. Whenever Michael would get
set to deliver a wallop Kay promptly evaporated, and
then before King could get the hang of what had
happened something would hit him. On rare occa-
sions King manoeuvred Kay in a corner, whereupon
the elusive young man wriggled away, had a spit,
bogged in and shoved off some more. The referee
naturally gave Kay the verdict, and the Kingites
naturally gave the referee a severe talking to. .
* * * ■*
Proficiency in the manly art of bash
doesn’t seem to be worth tuppence as a protection to
the pocket, for though Life is short and Time is
fleeting there is no class of men who make such a
bad job of hanging on to their cash as pugs. Of
course, the explanation is simple; but that is another
matter. About the central fact there is no doubt at
all, it being quite an exceptional pug who finishes
ahead of the game. This paper has a theory that
every pug during the period of his money-making
prime should be compelled by law to produce his
wad three times a day for inspection by a John Hop
armed with a warrant to arrest him for lunacy if
there is Id. short. There are a lot of pugs in
Australia who after making fair-sized heaps in the
ring are not taking up large blocks of War Loan
certificates. One or two of them may get back some
of the missing links with fortune, but the lives of
most of them merely make additional chapters in
“The Old Story Over Again,” a standard work which
20 years ago had reached page 9762, ohap. ccelvii
vol. 674. Since then an additional vol. has been
issued every five minutes.

J. A. Prout, who had the largest appetite
on the first day of Queensland track and field cham
pionships last Saturday, is a versatile performer
He won the broad jump (20ft. was second
in the 440yds., and third in 120yds. hurdles' and
this accumulation of points lifted him into leading
position for the all-round championship. Inciden
tally, his legs helped Thompson Estate Harrier-
to sit in top place for the club premiership.
The memory of Jim Macmanamey’s work
for N.S.W. Rugby Union will be kept green by the
shields introduced into public-school football Mae
was a stalwart player in the days when the Union
flourished : then as president and referee he kept the
concern together. The Union never had a worker
whose toil better deserved recognition than that of
the big-hearted Major Jim.
Syd Stearnes, of Launceston (Tas.), isn't
one of the sports who could go to the Front but
don’t. He is too young—only 17. Nevertheless
the other day he whirled over the distance from
Hobart to Launceston ,(121 miles) on a 7h p
Indian motor-cycle in 2h. 32min. 20see., knocking
lmin. 10 sec. off the record lately put up by AV. H
King. Stearnes now claims the five-mile world’s
record of 4min. 40 2-ssec., the 50-mile Tas. record
of 51imin., and the 4-mile Tasmanian record of
27see. —not bad for a boy.
* * * *
Australian cyclist Bob Spears put another
feather on his wheel lately by defeating the great
Yankee flier Kramer in a match at Newark (U.S.A.).
Spears hails from Dubbo (N.S.W.), and before he
climbed aboard an outgoing boat was one of the finest
sprinters in this section of the world. The recent
win puts Spears in a place nice and handy to the
cashbox.
* * * *
Australian cyclists are not finding fault
with the financial side of pedalling in the U.S.A.
Besides the prize-money they annexed last season,
Spears, Goullet, McNamara, Grenda, Walker and
Clark cut up £3900 in promoters’ fees between them.
That ought to keep them in chewing-gum for a while.

Apparently there is no way of making a
close game of billiards between Fred Lindrum and
Williams. They played another 18,000 up at Alcock’s
Parlor in Melbourne lately, with the proviso that
neither man should make more than 25 consecutive
“losers” off the red. The restriction was all in
favor of the Englishman, of course, but it didn’t
save him from a severe doing. Without making
any sensational breaks, such as ..brother Walter and
Maconachy scored off the red in their “all in’’
match, Lindrum beat Williams by a few thousand
points. Now he is tackling young Mac. in a
restricted game, giving a start of 3000.

N.S.W. Cricket Association is determined
to do something new next season with its scoring
system. The scale of points will run this way:
For an outright win 4, win on first innings 3, draw
2, loss on first innings 1, outright loss 0. It is
explained that this is highly scientific. Another
scheme is to bestow a club championship based on
the records in the three grades. It all looks very
good, but .the interest in cricket is not going to
distract attention from Europe for a day or two.

The oldest cricket identity in N. S. Wales
is George Moore, of West Maitland, who is 96 and
not out! He played in the N. S. Wales 22 against
Stephenson’s All England XI, the first English team
to visit Australia (1862). The locals won by 12
wickets. In the first innings George Moore’s analysis
showed 83 balls, nine maidens, 22 runs, four wickets.

How to Treat Your Hair and Complexion.
A Few Simple Beauty Hints.
By Mdlle. GABY DESLYS, the welhknown Parisian Actress.
YOU ask me for a few hints on the
treatment of the hair and complexion.
Well, the less “treatment” you give
the skin the better. I do not
believe much in massage, but a
little cream to the face is neces-
sary to counteract the effects of
wind or sun. What cream
would I recommend? Well, I
advise you to use a little mer-
colised wax every night and
again in the morning, after
washing the face. Rub it
gently into the skin, then wipe
off any superfluous wax and
dust a little barri-agar over
the face. - You will find that
this will be the only “treat-
ment” necessary and will keep
your face fresh and youthful-
looking for all your life. The mercolised
wax removes all the dead outer skin, so
that you have always a fair, fresh com-
plexion like a girl’s.
For the hair, the first and most important
Photo: Wrather <£■ Buys
thing is a good shampoo. Never use any:
thing inferior to wash the hair with. Get
some good stallax from your chemist and use
a teaspoonful in a cup of hot
water. Then rinse the hair
well and it will look bright and
gloss-y.
A tonic is necessary when the
hair is inclined to fall out more
than it should, and is always
good to use during the spring
and autumn. Then the hair
needs a little —what do you call
it V —stimulant, and for this 1
would advise you to get a packet
of boranium and mix it with
some bay rum ; dab this into the
roots and it will not only stop
the fall, but make your hair
grow long and thick. Give your
hair a good brushing every night, and that
will be all that you need do.
Blackheads Fly Away.
Instantaneous Remedy for Blackheads, Greasy Skin and Enlatged Pores.
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged pores’,
recently discovered, is now coming into
general use in the boudoir. It is very
simple, harmless and pleasant. Drop a
stymol tablet, obtained at the chemist’s, in
a tumblerful of hot water. After the. effer-
vescence has subsided bathe the face in the
liquid, using a small sponge or soft cloth.
In a few minutes dry the face and the offen-
sive blackheads will come right off on the
towel. Also the large oily pores immedi-
ately close up and efface themselves natu-
rally. The greasiness disappears and the
skin is left smooth, soft and cool. This
simple treatment is- then repented a few
times at intervals of four or five days, to
ensure the permanence of the result.
Grey Hair—Home Remedy.
An old-fashioned Recipe restores Youthful Appearance.
There are plenty of reasons why grey
hair is not desirable, and plenty of reasons
why hair dyes should not be used. But, on
the other hand, there is no reason why you
should have grey hair if you do not want
it. To turn the hair back to a natural color
is really a very simple matter. One has
only to get from the chemist two ounces of
concentrate of taminalite and mix it with
three ounces' of bay rum. Apply to the
hair with a small sponge for a few nights
and the greyness will gradually disappear.
This liquid is not sticky or greasy and does
not injure the hair in any way. It has been
used for generations with most satisfactory
results by those who have known the
formula.
To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
The most Effective Formula ever Discovered.
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but now
to kill the hair roots permanently. i* or
this purpose pure powdered pheminol may lie
applied directly to the objectionable hair
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the
hair but also to actually h\ll the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol, obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.

Good News for Fat People.
Something New in Obesity Cures.
A Loudon chemist says: “The latest
method of reducing obesity certainly is far
more pleasant and convenient than all pre-
vious methods. It consists merely in eating
clynol berries. The fat person who wants
to reduce without the usual rigid diet, exer-
cise, sweating baths, etc., now puts a few
of these little brown berries in his or her
pocket and eats three or four each day.
Clynol berries not only eliminate fat from
the body, but also correct the tendency,
which is usually constitutional, to create
fatty matter. No discomfort whatever is
caused by their action ; in fact, except for
the loss of superfluous fat and the feeling
of “fitness” so created, you would not be
aware that these little berries were doing
their work.
Local inquiry shows that clynol berries are
not very well known in this country, but
the demand- is increasing daily, and any
chemist can quickly procure them if specially
requested to do so.

Bulletin takes your fancy, write to the
Manager, who will quote you price for it.
“Viking”: How would the following bill
be filled ? —-
(1) The best-predueed play—in Australia, of
course.
(2) The best grand opera.
(3) The best comic opera or musical comedy.
(4) The best drama.
F<n‘ humbers one ahd three, I advance the
claims of Asche’s “Kismet” and Meynell and
Gunn’s “Arcadians*’ respectively. For the
other two classes, 1 would prefer to hear
some of the greybeards of Poverty Point.
“j-P*”: Fred Niblo seems to be hitting
New York hard. At present there is not a
inhmmer who is getting more F.S. limelight,
lie has been a big success as lead in “Hit"
the-Trail Holiday,” which, front all
accounts, is a mighty poor play, and would
UeVer have been a success without Niblo’s
personality. Anyhow, New York is start-
ing to dedicate popular songs to
Niblo and to call its candy and the
collars it wears after him. Mortal actor
couldn’t ask for more than that.
“Stargazer”: A well-known Australian
songstress who thinks she is (on the whole)
rather better than the greatest, was leading
a company in a Commonwealth concert
tour. At one Queensland hotel the bird
was exercising her throat in early-morning
trills. She vocalised with surpassing
energy in her room, which was one floor
up, and facing the street. Presently over
the verandah roof peered a wild-eyed, rough-
haired man. “Madam,” he said, “can I be
of any assistance to you?”
“Jwosp”: Only 43 plays have run more
than 500 performances on the London stage,
and of these 25 are musical shows and six
are farcical. None of the others worry
about the infernal triangle. Seven have
gone over. 700. “Charley’s Aunt” (1466)
leads, but for length of run “Our Boys”
has three months to the good. Then come “The
Chinese Honeymoon,” 1075; “Dorothy,’
931; “The Arcadians,” 809; “The Private
Secretary,” 785; “The Merry Widow,” 778;
“San Toy.” 775; “The Geisha,” 760; “A
Country Girl,” 729; “Les Cloches de Corne-
ville,” 705; “H.M.S. Pinafore,” 700. In
Australia “A Shop Girl” did nothing, but
London went to it 546 times, and saw “A
Message from Mars,” 544 times. “Peg o’
My Heart” is the latest to get on this
honors board with 520. The first produc-
tion in Britain to go over the 50 mark was
“The Beggar’s Opera,” in 1728, and it
raised Lavinia Fenton from rags to be
Duchess of Bolton. The first to beat the
century was “Tom and'Joey” at the Adelphi
in 1821. It was an adaptation of a book
called “Life in London.” Bayle Barnards
“Casco Bay,” in 1827, reached 140, and,
strangely enough, has never been revived.
It was passed two years later by Douglas
Jerrold’s “Black-Eyed Susan,” with 150.
T. P. Cooke played his part twice nightly—
at Covent Garden to Ellen Tree’s Susan, ana
at the Surrey to Miss Scott’s. The first
play of Master Will’s to pass the century
was Charles Kean’s “Henry VIII.” in 1800,
and the run was stopped by the end of the
season. It opened the following season with
50 more nights. In 1860 “The Fobcen
Bawn” blew everything late high with Z6X.
successive nights, and modern long runs date
from that point. In New York, by the
wav. “A Trip to Chinatown leads with
690; then “Adonis,” 651; ‘Teg o My
Heart,” 604.
“D.F.”: Interesting just now to note that
the first play ever staged in Australia was
called “The Recruiting Sergeant. It is
described as a comedy, however, while the
present version is a tragi-comedv. On the
Evening of .Tune 4. 1789, the birthday of
Kino- George 111., the not-yet-18-months-old
Sydney saw its first play. The contemporary
critic Collins says: '
Some of the convicts were permitted to perform
Farquhar’s comedy, “The Recruiting Sergeant, in
a hut fitted up for the occasion. They professed no
higher aim than “humbly to excite a smile, and
their efforts to please were not unattended with
applause.
“Harrison O.” : I have just sampled Wish
Wvnne at Melbourne Bijou, and found her
the best of Wishes and a meritorious
Wynne. As an artist in character, as dis-
tinct from caricature, she is entitled to any-
thing her press-agent may say of her. Bhe
ia the first stage performer I have seen who
presents the common or crockery-breaking
Martha with absolute fidelity, and her truth
is funnier than others’ fiction. Restraint is
the keynote of her work, yet she “gets there ’
every time, chiefly, it seems to me, because
she lias a large human sympathy that gives
her a real affection for the types she is
guving, and which has helped so many
artists to success, from Chaucer to C. J.
Dennis.
THE ORCHESTRAL CONCERT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
To Melbourne William Fenn had come
Upon his yearly burst;
Me looked upon the beer when brown,
And sought with foaming pints to drown
A really gorgeous thirst.
At night the Town Hall Fenn descried
Lit up, and paid to go inside.
The orchestra was in its place;
A man, long-haired and thin,
A baton waved and straight away
The wood and string began to play,
And soon, with noisy din,
The trombones and the cornets tried
Like mad to beat the other side.
They made a most impressive row.
Euphoniums blared scorn,
And then, with cold dislike imbued,
The big bassoon said something rude
That roused the silent horn;
Whereat the whole dashed crowd joined in
And drowned the argument with din.
Things went more smoothly for a while,
But soon broke loose again.
Till half-past eight Bill thought it fine;
But when it. got to after nine,
And still they kept on, Fenn
Arose in wrath, demanding, “Shay,
When do yo’ slitart th ’ btanky play?”

THERE is something most satisfactory about
haying on the right shoes for the occa-
sion in hand. One feels comfortable,
smart, confident. And for any and every
occasion nothing could be more suitable or more
charming than patent leather, which always
looks well and goes so beautifully with every
colour and every fabric. Indeed, this little
shoe here illustrated will add no small share
of smartness and tone to one’s spring suit or
summer gown. And it is only one style of
many equally desirable, equally charming. For
Bostock shoes, besides being the last word in
smartness, all have a certain individuality which
sets them apart amongst ready-made shoes,
gives them the personal quality and the dis-
tinctive tone of shoes made specially to measure.

W. 8.: “Our Folk” poorly written and without inter-
est Iconoclast: Not our style. Might sell else-
where.... Uno Hoo: It’s crude verse, all right....
Maori: “Boy” won’t d0....L.L.: Not our style....
11. R.: “Way of all Flesh” too crude W. 8.:
“Kaiser Bill” is awful... .M.M.K.: Can’t give
“Deirdre” legend here. Read J. M. Synge’s “Deirdre
of the Sorrows”... .11. C.: No thanks... .M.E.F.: In
that easy metre lines ought to scan without j01t5....
No name: “Oh, shade of Tennyson who echoed well
the nation’s sentiment in time of hell.” Take the
horror away.... Otia: “My Poet” doesn’t get into
print... .LAV.: “E’er chaos is the goal which ye
hath gained.” Outski!.... Gerald S.: Doesn’t quite
get there... .M.N.: “Fight On” is a wild jumble of
bad prose with an irritating rhyme here and there.
....The Wasp: Well, lots of people would be glad if
Sunday lasted all the week. ... Notsum: What did
Kitchener ever do to deserve that?... .Viva: No use
for translations... .Matoka: There isn’t a smile in
it... .Willie: One verse (flesh and blood can’t stand
more) :
But oh! what do the cables tell Bill Hughes;
That our famous Lord Kitchener
(To whom the cables do refer)
Sleeps his last sleep together with the news
To Russia he was carrying, to help
To down the Kaiser and his son, the whelp!
. ...J.R.R.: With practice you could chop better
verses out of a hardwood post... .M.A.: “Reverie”
no good. “Little Men” held for inquest... .5.8.:
“Ward Peace” suggests an insane person catching
butterflies with a road roller. E.L.: Give your
typewriter a drink A.G. J.: Slight ideas, and verse
that falls over its own feet... .W.R.C.: Not enough
in it.... J.A.V.S.: Whisky soliloquy too slight. .. .
H.G.: “Young Widow” with wooden legs and splay-
feet doesn’t interest us... .D.A.K.: Three stanzas,
which are better than a lot we’ve read:—
In a country grave yard on a hot summer’s day
I’m sitting and musing on life’s thornv way,
And I think as I gaze on the graves all around
That the end of it all is a hole in the ground.
Your Caesars, Napoleons—where are they to-day?
They blazed for a time and their blaze passed awav ;
Go seek for their dust and where will it be found?
Where the dust of the dead lies in holes in the
ground.
Yet we crush and we trample, we struggle and fight,
So heedless of wrong, so regardless of right,
And should riches and honor and glory be found,
What’s the end of it all but a hole in the ground ?
. ...J.F.: Even if you are a first offender, the crime
is pretty black... .G.G.: “Kitchener” sonnet with-
out a gleam E.P.: So wooden that it broke into
splinters in the mailbag J.G.M.: Thanks for clip-
ping. Glad to hear that there was a General at
Suez who, when two “society” females objected to
dine in the same room as two N.C.O.’s who had just
done valuable work, took the men into his private
room and entertained them there. It is the sort
of thing old General White would do. But the
women, after all, were less to blame than the snob-
bish Army order which prohibits privates and
N.C.O.’s from entering the dining and grill rooms
of the best hotels in Egypt.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
M.S.: That was one of the nasty things Adam
said to Eve after she’d misfed him and made him a
dyspeptic... .A. 11.: It isn’t art and It isn’t humor.
. ...G.F.8.: Constant Reader, did you ever see any-
thing like it in this paper?... .J.C.: Unoriginal and
dreary B.II.: Immature Dan H.: Return-
ing Frank C.Thanks. Will use T.S.: Very
sick effort... .C.W’.R.: One of those unnecessary-
tilings .... Mac: A thin jest Bro: Feeble....
E.E.C.: Stocked up with bears for the winter....
J.F.A.: That joke is earning a lot of overtime now.
When Australians wanted flour, vegetable
and even some farm seeds they generally, in
the past, sent around the world for them;
hut it’s such a job to get the imported stuff
now that a few men in the business are
thinking of trying to actually grow the seeds
in the Commonwealth. They have got hold
of. 100 acres near Hobart, and if Treasurer
Higgs will let them raise the capital—as, of
course, he will —they mean to get busy on it
and see if it will grow turnip seed and peas
and beans and phlox and one thing and
another. If the venture goes all right they
propose then to get the local inhabitants to
come into the scheme. The co. will supply
the seed to start with, supervise the cultiva-
tion, and buy the crop. As the few seeds
which are grown in the Speck have a big
reputation on the mainland—Tasmanian
asters, for instance —the scheme looks good,
and worth this paper’s blessing.

THE LARGEST STOCK
in Australia we carry of Spoons
and Forks.
Our output of them is so large
it pays us to stock them.
WHY ?
So large a turnover. Presumably
because a very discriminating-
public realises that we lead in
quality, in price, in style with them.
We really do lead with them.
Because we put our best brain
efforts back of them.
Because our Spoons and Forks
are made by the latest
machinery, which saves enor-
mously and yet produces a
much harder base and more
symmetrical than by the old
hand process.
Because the Silverplating is the
heaviest made.
Because an “Fx,,& R’’ Spoon will
wear for forty years.
Because our prices are the lowest
—quality considered.

Little Lectures
by Nurse ‘Wincarnis
(Lecture No 4.)
Weakness
Every movement of thebody
uses up a definite-amount of
vitality. When you overtax
yourself, or your vitality is
undermined by illness, your
whole system becomes too
exhausted to recover its lost
vitality without assistance.
Your system is like a plant
that is drooping for want
of water. And just as
water revives a drooping
plant—so ‘ Wincarnis ’ gives
new life and new vitality to
a weakened constitution,
Because ‘ Wincarnis ’ pos-
sesses a four-fold power.
It is a Tonic, a Restorative,
a Blood-maker, and a Nerve
Food —all in one. Therefore
creates new strength, new
blood, new nerve force and
new vitality. The benefit
begins from the first wine-
glassful. You can feel it
doing you good. Over 10,000
Doctors recommend ‘ Win-
carnis,’ especially to those
who are Weak, Anaemic,
‘Nervy’ or Run-down.
Begin to get well
TO-DAY.
‘Wincarnis’ is made in England by
COLEMAN & CO., Ltd., Wincarnis
Works, Norwich. You can buy
‘Wincarnis’ from all Chemists and
Stores selling wines, prices 4/- and
6/6, but if you experience any diffi-
culty in obtaining it, write direct
to Sole Distributing Agents, Fassett
& Johnson, 6-7 Barrack St., Sydney.

IN BANANA LAND
Undeterred by the piffling detail that Aus-
tralia is growing less sugar than is required
for local needs and acquires the remainder
from Formosa, Ryan, talking in London,
asks J. Bull to explain why he doesn’t supply
himself from Bananaland. Why does Lon-
don buy cheap German sugar instead of
cultivating cane in Bananaland? It is a
question that ought to be answered. And
the responsibility of Answering it lies more
with T. Ryan than with J. Bull.
The Full Court’s decision, that the Act
passed last session did not give the Stale
insurance office a monopoly of Queensland s
workmen’s compensation (accident) busi-
ness, hasn’t settled the trouble; and Costs
still has hopes. Companies before being
permitted to compete with the State office
must get the permission of the Governor-m-
Council; and so far, though many have
applied for it, none have got it. The cos.
are now taking opinion as to whether per-
mission can be refused without reasonable
cause. What the people, for their _ part,
might consider is whether the salaries of
Ministers and M’s.P. shouldn’t be charged
with all this law expense as a punishment
for passing such a muddled law.
“Cato”: A storm is raging about the A ar-
sity Senate elections. Graduates elect 10
members and the Government nominates 10.
Certain meds., lawyers and parsons writhe
in agony lest Labor nominate “hewers ot
wood and drawers of water.” A caucus of
the cultured has issued a circular asking for
votes for its selection ; but old members of
the Senate like R. H. Roe and J. L. Wool-
cock are not in the circular. The idea is
that, if Culture wins, Labor will practically
be compelled to nominate the old members.
The result would be a Senate of the truest
blue. The scheme was working beautifully
till a newspaper got hold of the circular.
Now the smile is on the face of the tiger.
BROTHER BEST GIVES OUT THE HYMN.
THE EIDER: “Brethren and sistern, we will now all yewnite in singin that beautiful
yinn, ‘Man Wants but Little Ear Bclow, Nor Wants that Little Long!”
“McNorth”: The right to set a trap-gun
with the object of blowing an in-
truder to the hereafter was contested at the
recent sittings of the Cooktown District
Court. A troublesome Binghi had developed
the habit of breaking into the humpy of a
miner in an outlying portion of the Cohen
Goldfield, Cape York, whilst the miner was
at his claim a mile or two away. The
miner wearied of the repeated thefts, and
at last fixed up a gun to pepper the intruder.
He also stuck up a big notice of warning,
but as Binghi couldn’t read, his next attempt
to burgle the humpy was his last. The
miner was charged with manslaughter. For
the defence it was claimed that anyone may
set a trap-gun in the night-time for the pro-
tection of his property. Binghi, in his dying
depositions, had said that he was shot some
time “before breakfast,” and as “before
breakfast” might mean any time since sup-
per the previous night, there was no proof
that the gun had been discharged in the day-
time. The Court agreed and the miner was
acquitted; but he was feeling very thankful
that Binghi was an early riser.
To June the Twenty-first.
[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
Shortest day of all the year,
When the misty, humid tear
Slowly falls from Norfolk pines,
Surest of the wintry Signs;
Weeping like a schoolboy's nose,
As the weary, short day goes;
Clear, Cold nights and watery moon—
Good-bye, twenty-first of June!
Morningsunlight’s cold and wan ;
Summer ‘seems for ever gone;
Cold the nose of him who dares
Daybreaks, full of polar bears;
Nights of winter that remind
Us there’s chopped ice in the wind,
Of our good blood-heat the thief,
Spoiling our best handkerchief.
Mallee roots in grates a boon —•
Good-bye, twenty-first of June I
Broken Hill sees flakes ..of snow-
Where shall we for summer go?
Melbourne’s eyes are watering still,
It is cold in Wowserville;
Bleak the air at Ballarat,
Freezing dog and freezing cat.
Hear the snow-gnome tell his rune —■
Good-bye, twenty-first of June!
Zeehan holds it holiday
If the rain but stays away;
Over frozen button grass
Hear the wind from Cape Horn pass;
ltocks are goosefleshed in the sea,
Chattering reefs of Reniine;
And the sperm whale plans to blow
In the streets of Bendigo ;
And the walrus takes his seat
In the train for Burrumbeet;
Icebergs crash a splintered tune—•
Good-bye, twenty-first of June 1
Colder, shorter hours to sin
Make it easier Heaven to win;
Who can be a bad, mad lad,
If he be not warm and glad?
When the summer blisters paint,
Hard it is to be a saint;
But, when winds are cold and keen,
Many a martyr I have been;
I could in a cloister croon—
Good-bye, twenty-first of June 1
Warmed am I with memories
Of the splendid northern seas,
Where no cold, imported snow
Comes, nor alien winds can blow;
Where Australian weather stays
Every year for all the days;
Where pineapples send their scent
To the deep blue firmament.
Come no polar bears to shock ;
Glad snakes frizzle on the rock ;
Haste we north to life and noon —•
Good-bye, twenty-first of June!
There the naked Binghi sprawls,
Listening to the schooner’s pawls,
When the anchor comes apeak,
Near the Islands of the Week.
Icebergs may not dare the fates
Of the wondrous Torres Straits;
Let Cape Horn its curses spill
In the streets of Wowserville;
We shall watch the palm trees sway
Though it be the shortest day.

RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, June 24, 1910.
My Dear Thargomindati,—
His Ex. and camp-followers are week-
ending in Rockhampton and inspecting the
annual collection of poddies and pumpkins.
He has promised to come home on A eclnes-
day.
Arthur Morgan, who has been running
his Ex.’s job as a side-lme, bestowed
official patronage upon a kindergarten turn-
out at the Stadium on Thursday. ihe
battle-ring was judiciously disguised as a
model play-school for the occasion. Dur-
ing the show several gents, with well-
developed jaws wandered in. and after gaz-
ing at the invasion in a dazed manner made
a dash for the exits. The Arthur Morgan
lady beamed upon the infants, and every-
body seemed satisfied.
Acting-Premier Theodore opened a fete
this afternoon in aid of the Catholic Club
and Catholic Military Tents. Fortune-
tellers, art unions and a mixture of sweets,
cushions, hair tidies and vegetables were
thrust upon the hapless visitor.
Colonel J. F. G. Foxton, kindliest and
most courteous of gentlemen, died on Fri-
day afternoon. For 21 years he represented
Carnarvon in the State Parliament, w r as
Minister for Lands in three Ministries and
Home Sec. in tw 7 o others. Then he went to
the House of Reps., stayed there for four
years, and was Minister without portfolio
in the third Deakin Ministry. Ilis biggest
job w r as as Australian representative in the
Imperial Defence Conference. A solicitor
by profession, he was a member of the firm
of Foxton, Hobbs and Macnisli. Out
of office hours he was a keen sol-
dier, and in pre-Federal days did much
to make this State’s volunteers efficient.
Tw'O awards from the Royal Life Saving
Society-—one for rescuing a girl at
St Kilda beach, another for attempting
something similar in the Brisbane River —
w 7 ere among the things he never referred to.
Mrs. La Ferme, a Russian lady wintering
here, is acting as auctioneer at various
charitable functions. Last Wednesday £3O
fell to her hammer for the Wounded Sol-
diers’ Fund, and to-night she auctioned
several gifts at the Empire in aid of the
Children’s Hospital. She operates in a very
pretty Russian peasant’s costume.
Gladys Brown, a cool young person aged
10, who recently made a hurried excursion
into the river and returned bearing her 10
year-old cousin and then completed the i 0 b
by restoring the nearly-drowned, had a gold
pendant and a silver medal handed her one
afternoon last week. The pendant was the
gift of the Mayoress, and the medal was
from the Kangaroo Point State School
Swimming Club, of which Gladys is
member. The little girl’s brave perform-
ance was undertaken in full dress, including
hat and lace-up boots.
The committee working for the sth Light
Horse Comforts Fund has started a kitchen
in the main street of this village—anyway
you can step into it from the main street’
Excellent cakes, straight from the oven, are
sold, and the money so raised is converted
into dainties for Billjim.
A widower-twice recently acquired a
bride who also had had previous experience
in the housekeeping business. In sending
out the invites, he added for tlie informa-
tion of a few pals: “Be sure and don’t
miss this; it will be no amateur perform-
ance.”
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Six o’clock closing is coming in Banana-
land, too. Mrs. Harrison Lee-Cowie, who
was responsible—so her supporters lie— for
the downfall of Bung in N. S. Wales, has
arrived to lead the charge; and Acting-
Premier Theodore promises a referendum
as soon as the House meets.
Donald Cameron, of Brisbane, who died
last week, was one of Queensland’s hest-
known educationists in his day. Starting
off in the Isle of Skye 77 years ago, he came
from Edinburgh University to the big
MoConnel family, of Cressbrook. After a
spell at Brisbane Grammar, he took over
the Ipswich school —putting through Judge
O’Sullivan, J. W. Blair, and sundry other
notables —finally going out as inspector of
grammar schools.
Justice-Minister Fihelly dropped an un-
expected bomb last week when he announced
that seven police magistrates had been
“relieved.” Moore, Eglinton and Morris
(all of Brisbane), Burrowes (Longreach),
Parkinson (Maryborough), Jackson
(Mackay) and Walker (Goondiwindi) have
all passed the 05 limit fixed by the Public-
Service Act; and apparently they have all
been shown the door without regard to their
present judicial ability.
“Itan”: The Ryan Government is
threatening to give the sugar monopoly a
rough twist. Though the details are not
known, it is stated that the C.S.R. Co. and
the Government have been unable to agree
on the refining terms for this season’s
output of raw sugar from the State mills.
Apparently the Government is sticking to
its guns, for it is now discussing the ques-
tion of turning the produce of the mills into
unrefined sugar. This was the article used
in the early days of the industry when the
snjall mills had no refinery at hand. It is
a first-class substitute, and, what is im-
portant in these days of economy, can be
produced a penny per lb. cheaper than
the refined. The Government is said to
contemplate a State refinery, despite the
Sugar Commission’s report. Whatever is
done, the C.S.R. is apparently to receive a
bump.

Rheumatism
SCIATICA, GOUT, LUMBAGO, etc.
In the majority of cases of Rheumatism,
Gout, Sciatica and similar complaints the
excruciating pain is caused by sharp-pointed
crystals of Uric Acid penetrating the delicate
and highly-sensitive nerves of the body. To
effect a cure this excess of Uric Acid must
be removed, and no treatment that does not
aim at this result will effect a cure.
Dr. Parker s Great Indian
Rheumatic Remedy
goes to the root of the trouble, and by remov-
ing the cause quickly affords relief and
eventually effects a permanent cure. Read
the following testimonial: —
Rheumatic Gout of the Winds and Feet Cured.
Mr. John Mcßae, of Elba, Gum Flat, In-
verell, writes: “I have finished the medicine,
also the liniment, you sent 'me, and I wish to
return my sincere and heartfelt thanks for
the relief I have gained by your treatment
for Rheumatism. All the pain has gone; I can
walk how. My hands are also better. I am
about to return to work, and intend to tell
my friends, and indeed strangers, about Dr.
Parker’s Wonderful Rheumatic Cure.”
Send 10/6 and medicine will be forwarded by
return, or write for sample and book (postage

Bon Ami, the wonderful and
unique American cleanser, is
the only soap that will clean a
nice mirror satisfactorily. You
spread the wet white lather
thinly on the glass. The lather
dries to a soft, white powder.
Then you wipe off the powder
with a dry cloth, leaving the
mirror brilliant and clear. No
streaks or smears, because when
the Bon Ami comes off, it is dry
as a bone. Every wet method
of cleaning a mirror leaves
smears that are hard to get rid
of; the Bon Ami wet-and-dry
method is a great improvement.
Also for windows, brasses, tin
ware, bath tubs, nickel and tile.

An official report from the Northern Terri-
tory secretary of the Australia Day I und
states that the mere handful of people up
there have handed out £2670 in 11 months.
It is a land of big ideals and bigger hearts.
Died at Richmond (Tas.) lately, Mrs.
Mary Crawley, probably the oldest woman
on the Speck. She had allegedly lived 162
years. Not long ago one Daniels, also of
Richmond, weighed anchor at a reputed 105.
An active competitor in the Ouse district
named Mrs. Kitchen recently had a bit of
bad luck. She had done a brisk 99 laps
when she fell in the fire and was burned to
death.
An Australian middy, Joseph Mack, was
killed aboard the Defence in the recent North
Sea fight. His father was Gardner Mack,
of Berry Bank, in Western Vic.—the family
has hung together for many years at that old
spot. Young Mack had been in the Aus-
tralian Navy until passed along under an
arrangement existing for such educative
transfers, and was promoted to sub-
lieutenant shortly before the big battle.
Owing to the war, Dookie agricultural
college has lost most of its students for the
time being; but at Burnley school of horti-
culture, which until lately used to receive
woman-students twice a week for afternoon
classes only, it is now found that the girls’
demand for tuition justifies an all-day and
every-day supply. It looks as though Mira-
bel and * Maude were beginning to take a
really serious view of the situation —parti-
cularly of the situation as typist in a stuffy
office at 15 shillings a week.
Kitchener’s exit per medium of German
explosives recalls that he was the soldier
who rescued Charles Neufeld from Omdur-
man. Taken prisoner by the Dervishes
while travelling by caravan from Wady
Haifa to Kordofan, starvation and scourg-
ing were this German’s lot for 12 awful
years. He was wearing 401 b. legirons when
Kitchener released him, and with his own
hands struck off the fetters. One German, at
any rate if he is still alive, would have cause
for a pang of regret at hearing of the Hamp-
shire tragedy.
Sergeant T. W. McCrystal, one of the
most prominent recruiters in N. S. Wales,
was one of the most argumentative of its
revolutionary Socialists a year or two ago.
When he was a member of the Wharf Labor-
ers’ Union he once opposed, on straight-out
Sosh lines, the Labor candidate at Pyr-
mont (Sydney), and at that time trounced
those behind the uabor movement as mere
muddlers. Nothing has since happened to
justifv him in making his old opinion stand
on its head.
A poor-looking thing was carried back the
other day to Sydney—charred and stained
and pierced by two holes, one of them
plugged with a piece of lead and a fragment
of blanket. It was a Bulletin of February
10, and with its good Australian mates it
had got into a warm corner —into a billet
behind the Australian lines in France. Cor-
poral F. C. Poole, of a battery of Field
Artillery, in forwarding the relic to a friend
in Sydney, gives the history of its
wounds: “It was with my kit in a
house we were billeted in—beneath a
roll of blankets. The squareheads evi-
dently took a tumble to us and shelled
the place heavily. So we quit. When
I raked over the ashes to see if any of my
kit had escaped, all I could find was the
last family journal to reach me. It may
interest you to see how it had suffered in
the bombardment.”
“10-2-4”: It seems to me that many of
the people who yell for the internment of
“all enemy aliens” do protest too much.
They bay for the unattainable, and then use
their failure as a reason why they, or their
relatives, should not enlist. The most
dangerous spies in Australia are probably
Australians, just as in France they are
Frenchmen, and in England English. It
would be better business for Germany to
buy an Australian of unimpeachable stock
to do -its dirty work than to employ a
German, who would necessarily have to
operate beneath a continuous flood of lime-
light. Australia needs more reticence far
worse than it needs more internments.
Why should Germany trouble to employ
paid spies of any sort, when there are
numbers of prosperous citizens ready and
willing to do all that hired traitors could
accomplish for the mere love of yapping?
Will Lawson puts on his sea-boots:—
The Takaptina, the little flier that was built to
carry the ’Frisco mail over the Onehunga bar (the
engineers will tell you that one turn of her propeller
drives her along 17ft. from a standstill), has been
running to the Sounds and West Coast again. A
tarry sea-dog pointed his finger at her the other
day and said he: “That there boat’s a miracle on bar
harbors. Every roller, cornin’ up astern, takes your
craft on the quarter and cants her out of her
course. That gets some skippers rattled. But, wait
on, an’ the roller runs alongside, like a big, friendly
pup, and gives ’er nose a tap, which it straightens
her up again. You must take bar ’arbors easy. Go
slow is the ideer, with a big kick up yer sleeve.
Then, when the roller has trimmed ’er up, let ’er
’ave it! I rec’lect once a roller let us down with a
bang right on the bar. ‘Stan’ by, to give ’er a
’ell of a kick!’ the old man sings out to the chief.
There we sticks, tremblin’, while another roller
comes lollopin’ up astern. First it cants ’er in a
sickly way ; then, as it begins to straighten ’er up,
the old man rings for steam. She got it and the
lift of the sea together, and in we goes like a
bullet, with me ’anging on to my sou’wester in the
wind she made.”
“J.F.IL”: Kalgoorlie continues to be the
boldest of Australian mendicants here in
London. The annual meeting of the Kal-
goorlie Diocesan Association has just been
held. This is the British begging agency
established by Dr. Golding-Bird, the Church
of England bishop of the second-richest gold-
field in the wide Empire. In its first year
the Association cadged from Cockneys £760,
and this ought to secure three square meals
a day for the Gaiters of Central Westralia
for the next few months. But are the
Church of England folks in rich Kalgoorlie
so desperately hard up that they could not
raise this £760 among themselves and escape
the humiliation of taking it as a charitable
gift from commiserating Cockneys?

Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy.
Nature lias endowed vour body with sixteen million snots to
which an ache or pain can be attached. When each of these spots is
filled with a hard, platinum-tipped pain ; when your head aches so
that you are conscious of all the ruffles and scallops on your brain ;
when vour heart thumps and your stomach wobbles and you feel as
if something is wallowing through your inside works ; when your
sternum feels stove in and your shoulder blades feel as though your
wings were beginning to sprout ; when you are first alive to the finger
tips thinking of the things you should do and then completely
exhausted by even the thought of doing them ; when your backbone
has the sensation of being twisted by a monkey wrench ; when you
are so dizzy that you can’t see, and your ears ring, and your eyes
water, and your nose is in such a state that it is presumption to lay
aside your handkerchief for one short minute ; when you cough and
sneeze and groan in turn—in fact, when you feel like the very deuce—
you can set it down that Influenza's grip has got you. The best
thing to do is go to bed, take Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy in
frequent doses and you will soon be right again.”
AH retailers are authorised to sell Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy under a guarantee ; if it does not

Has a Get Up all his Own
It’s the buoyant note
in his get up signal
that lifts you out of
sleep, glad to be
awake. It’s a get up
that makes you smile
an answer to Big Ben’s
morning greeting.
A wake up that tempts
a whistle as you dress —
that puts an edge on your
breakfast appetite—starts
you down stairs feeling
like a two year old.
At five, seven, or whatever
hour you set, Big Ben will wake
you and start you on your day.
He’ll rouse you gently with
ten half minute calls, or shake
off your sleep with a five minute
ring.
Big Ben is seven inches tall,
well built, handsome, punctual.
He has a big, easily read dial—a
cheerful, deep toned voice—large, com-
fortable winding keys—a light running
movement with watch-like escapement
—an alarm that calls steadily for five
minutes or intermittently for ten.
Big Ben undergoes a hundred inspec-
tions in the making and six rigid timing
tests before leaving the factory of the
Western Clock Co., La Salle, 111.,
U.S.A., Makers of Westclox. At alt
clock dealers, price 12/6; postage 1/-

“E.H.L.”: “Copy Boy” (B. l/6/’l6)
claims for the Herald and Weekly Times,
Melbourne, “the best array of newspaper
veterans in Australia.” Then he parades
them —16 employees with a record of over 30
years each. But that’s a mere kindergarten
class. At the Adelaide Register office
there are 26 hale-and-hearties with over 30
years to their credit and holding their own
quite easily with the recruits who are in
their 25th year of service. Quite a crowd
of youngsters have scored 21. Two have a
record of 60 years’ service, one 58, one 52,
one 47, two 42, five 41, one 39, one 38, one
37, two 36, two 35, two 34, two 33, three 32,
three 29, three 28, two 27, and three 26. The
employee who hasn’t been at the office 20
years or so is almost sure to be at the
Front: no less than 30 of them have enlisted.
Sydney Telegraph still manages to beat
the Censorship at times —as when it
announced the other morning that Persia
had joined in the great scrap and annexed
all the south-west of Russia. Apparently
the rumor that Xerxes is dead has been
exaggerated.
* * * *
From a S. M. Herald law report: —
Costs to be cots in the cause.
For the barristers and lawyers to sleep on
in their second childhood, no doubt.
Lieut. Syd. Addison, who hails from the
Huon, is the first man from the Speck to
pass the test for a pilot’s certificate at the
flying school in Victoria. He used to swing
the editorial “we” as editor of the Huon
Times ; and to one who has been in the
habit of perpetrating six fervid leaders a
week, lofty flights should come pretty easy.
“Pejay”: I disagree with “Black Rock”
(B. 1/6/T6) when he says the Argus is
the third-oldest paper in Victoria. The
Portland Guardian beats it easily for the
place. The first issue was printed by
Thomas Richardson at “Portland, District
of Port Phillip, New South Wales,” in 1842,
and the paper, therefore, commences its
75th year on August 20 next.. It is the
second-oldest rag in Victoria, . Geelong
Advertiser winning by a stick, with Mel-
bourne Herald third.
T. Dunbabin, an ex-lihodes scholar who
has during the last six years emptied many
inkpots on all manner of things, from leaders
up to advt. write-ups, in the service of
Hobart Mercury, has found life in the
Speck too strenuous, and is moving to a
job on the Melbourne Argus. In his leisure
moments he has imagined a good deal for the
Scientific American and other frivolous
productions.
A Bendigo paper, complimenting a local
official the other day, assured its readers:
“Mr. is the round pig in the round
hole.”
* * * *
Early days of the Melbourne Austral
Salon are recalled by mention of the death
in London of Mrs. Alexander, better known
in Australia as Molly Hirst Browne. She
was a rather well-known press-woman in
her day, and in conjunction with the late
Mrs. Charles Bright was in the genesis of
the best known of Melbourne women’s
clubs.
* * * *
Another great reform has been effected
by the war. Even the Age makes promise
of amendment. Referring in its issue of
13/6/T6 to the need for curtailing its
consumption of paper, it says: “This will not
involve the exclusion of news, but its pre-
sentation in a more compressed and more
readable form.” Let it be accounted to the
Kaiser for righteousness.
C. A. Pearson, talking of the recently-
deceased London Standard, tells of a curi-
ous practice he discovered when he took over
the paper. A porter (30s. a week) stood
at the door of the office and saw that no
deserving person went away without a “beer
ticket.” The drayman who brought a load
of paper, the boy who kept a visitor’s coat
from brushing against the wheel of a hansom
cab. the bearer of a letter —each received a
ticket entitling the holder to half a pint of
beer at any publichouse in the neighborhood.
The passports were redeemed on Saturday
mornings, and cost the hospitable old paper
about £BOO a yen’-. There is m unconfirmed
rumor that the Fairfaxes do the same thing
in Sydney.
SPEED AND SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
\ irgil wrote five lilies of the iEneid daily, taking
the utmost pains to polish and perfect his verses.
Qive me a Roman toga, draped about me
In white and clinging folds to keep me proud ;
Let no dull modern voices come to flout me;
Build solid walls to shield me from the crowd.
Spread me white paper on a marble table;
Let some fair slave-girl hold my tuneful ink;
Smash down the telephone and cut the cable
And stand aloof from me and let me think !
W reathed with a chaplet of the choicest roses,
With music down the garden far away—
So far that silence round its cadence closes
And scarce I know the tune the harpers play—-
I should set all my happy fancies t moving-,
Beat out five lines of my triumphant ode
And slowly reap a golden harvest proving
The mettle of the Pegasus I rode.
But here, where motors honk and tramcars rattle
And half the world is mad with haste and fret,
The singer girds his soul to wildly battle
V hile all the discords of the sphere are met.
Tv eed for his robes, a telephone to tinkle
When finest frenzy moves his throbbing brain,
The clatter of the street to duly sprinkle
His chaste, white thought with its obscene refrain.
Speak not to me in high and lofty praises
Of those who wrote in fine aesthetic calm !
Hence! While the holy flame within me blazes
To light the haggard darkness with a psalm!
Bring your old singers here and let us try them
Amid the rush and hurry of the time—
Our modern cooks of song would simply fry them
And dish them brown in phantasy and rhyme.

Advice to
Nursing Mothers
MANY mothers would like to feed their
own children, but are denied the privilege
of doing so, because they have not suffi-
cient nourishment for them. The “Allenburys”
scientific system of Infant Feeding has provided
for all this. When a mother is partly able to
feed her'baby she may give The "Allenburys" Milk
Food No. I for alternate /feeds, so alike are the
natural and prepared food in this instance, and this
food should be continued until the weaning process
has been entirely completed. The mother herself
must be well nourished and to this end may partake
freely of the "Allenburys" DIET a partially pre-
digested milk and wheaten food, which like the '
Milk Food No. 1, is instantly made ready for use
by simply adding boiling ivater , only. After
childbirth the “Allenburys" DIET is surprisingly
helpful in maintaining the strength and producing
a good flow of rich milk.

Another Charming Actress Praises
Dr. Sheldon's New Discovery

*7?
Miss ELWYN HARVEY
(from a photo, from Lafayette Studios.)
Miss Elwyn Harvey, the
charming young Australian
Actress who has so delighted
Sydney audiences in the past,
is now appearing with marked
success in the George Marlow
Sbakspearian Company at the
New Adelphi Theatre.
A truly delightful "New
Discovery Girl” is Miss Har-
vey. She writes as follows:
I wish to tell you how much
benefit I have received from
the use of Dr. Sheldon’s New
Discovery. In my work my
throat often becomes irri-
tated from strain and theatre
dust, and often it would be
impossible for me to go
through my part if it were
not for the benefit I get from
a dose or two of Dr. Shel-
don’s New Discovery. Also,
on two occasions I have been
so unfortunate as to contract
a heavy cold, and on each of
these occasions Dr. Sheldon’s
New Discovery helped me at
once, and soon rid me entirely
of the trouble.
I think there is nothing like
it, and always have a bottle
at home, for during the win-
ter I look to it as my safe-
guard against the throat chills
contracted so easily when
leaving the heated dressing-
room and going into the
chilly night air.
I assure you I will always
recommend it to all my
friends.
Yours sincerely,
(Sgd.)~ ELWYN HARVEY.

June.
[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
SO I who wooed her watched her timidly
Stoop low beside the waters, with
’ her cool,
White hand poised like a lily o’er the pool.
Blue eyes were in that clear tranquillity,
And two white-cloud breasts. How I grieved
to see
Her grief was paramount. She could not
school
Fair Reason. Avho is always Passion's fool;
So her tears fell, and she was lost to me.
Then I cried to her: “June!” The very
word
Found echo in the sorrow of the skies.
A wondrous wind came storming from the
South,
And every clamorous pulse of Winter stirred.
1 could not see, the rain was in mine eyes;
Nor cry again, a green bough lashed my
mouth.

BOYCE BOWDEN.
The Frightfulness of the C.L.S.C.
[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
SYDNEY was in the grip of one of its
recurrent burglary epidemics. Even
the oldest inhabitant/ admitted that
he had known nothing like it. As always,
the police were helpless. They nailed a
stray offender here and there, but he usu-
ally turned out to be some pettifogging
amateur who represented little real danger
to either life or property. It was known
that the city and suburbs were being
methodically worked by a sort of burglari-
ous Camorra, if not several of them, yet
in four months not one of the gang, or
gangs, was taken. The police w r ere not to
blame. The fact was the supply of burg-
lars vastly exceeded the force available to
cope with it. Some of the richest suburbs
ran to no more than one policeman to
5000 residents. Given bad seasons and tight
money, and burglary became one of the
obvious professions.
The most audacious things were done.
A Puisne Judge and his wife were
awakened one night by the switching on of
the electric light in their bedroom. Before
them stood two men heavily masked. One
held a levelled revolver. “It’s no use
kicking, Judge,” he said. “We’re after your
wife’s jewels and we mean to have them.
It may save trouble if you say at once
where they are. Make a noise and
I blow your brains out.” The Judg<* was
as courageous as the next man, but he
appreciated his limitations. Urged on by
his terrified wife he told where the jewel-
lery was, and a few minutes later the click
of gears being pushed home and the faint
suspiration of a high-powered motor-car in
action indicated that the thieves were off.
The Pentarvons, who own half Bond-
ahra, were famous for their gold plate;
and also for their habit of leaving it in an
ordinary sideboard between the ending of
one of their big parties and the next morn-
ing, when it was sent back to the bank.
Sydney was thrilled, in due course, to learn
that, while one masked scoundrel had held
up the Pentarvon household from the top
of the main stairway, another had stolidly
piled the huge gold dishes and bowls into a
sack, flung them brutally into a Rolls-
Royce touring-car and then returned to
cover his friend’s retreat upon the hall.
The insurance companies put up their rates
against burglary to an impossible figure. A
panic set in. The community agreed furi-
ously that the situation was intolerable.
The usual people wrote to the papers, pas-
sionately, ungrammatically, to say so. The
leader-writers ascribed it variously to
Socialism and the unrest caused by the
propaganda of the Wade party. In the
meantime no one put forward a practical
scheme to cope with the calamity.
* * * *
Jimmy Fulton, son of old Jim Fulton,
the bank-manager, was commonly regarded
as a fool. His health was bad, and people
have a way of confusing poor health and
poor mentality. .. Furthermore, having in-
herited £BOO a year from his mother, he
declined to engage in regular work. He
interested himself in travel, in crime, and
in the task of adding to his little fortune.
The few who had had business dealings
with him did not subscribe to the popular
opinion of his intelligence.
He was dining with his father on the
night of the Pentarvon robbery. When the
coffee had been brought in and the servants
were gone Jimmv leaned across the table
and said: “I’ve got a scheme to stop this
burgling nuisance and I want you to help
“Tell me about it?’ said the older man.
“Of course I’ll do what I can in reason.
“You’ll agree,” began Jimmy, that our
present system of burglary-prevention is
rotten. There aren’t nearly enough police-
men. The people with the most tempting
portable goods are often the most crimin-
ally careless. Hardly one big house in 2U
Ims a burglar-alarm installed. Not that A
blame'the owners for that. Who wants to
find a burglar, anyhow? Personally I d as
soon stumble over a tiger. To disturb a
burglar in his operations is, to my mind,
simply asking for serious injury, if not
death. What the average peaceful, non-
athletic housefather wants is to have his
burglar taken for him. Now look at that.
Fulton, the elder, bent his head over a
line drawing of what appeared to be a
packing-case. . ,
“What the devil is it." ’ he asked.
“A burglar-trap. My own invention, and,
like all great inventions, childishly 1 ?-
I got the germ of the iflea from the Oubli-
ette at Chillon. Let me explain. The body
(marked A) is of iron. The clamps (L C
D F) are to fix the body to the underneath
part of a staircase. G and II are carpet-
covered flaps which work on the principle
of the ordinary stage trap-door. If you
look up the newspaper files of the past four
months you will find that over 90 per cent,
of our burglaries were committed by men,
working in pairs, who went upstairs. These
flaps are so designed that they work, when
set, only in the case of persons coming
downstairs. My theory is that if one of
two malefactors saw his companion dis-
appear through the stairs ahead of him he
would stay in the hall and so be lost to
Justice. More than that, he would give the
show away to his friends. With both of
them on the return journey, and the house
aroused, the second man would be bound
to take a chance, jump the trap that had
engulfed his companion, and land on the
one below it.”
“I rather fancy your notion,” said the
older man. “Where would you get your
traps?”
“Fleet Bros, have made 5000 for me and
are prepared to deliver a second 5000 at a
month’s notice.”
“And what is it you want me to do?”
“Put my plan before a dozen leading
bankers—they would listen to you where
they wouldn’t have me in their offices—per-
suade them to call a meeting of their chief
clients to consider ways and means of deal-
ing with the burglary scandal, and arrange
for me to address the gathering.”
And so the Citizens’ League for the Sup-
pression of Crime came into being. Inci-
dentally, Jimmy cleared £lO,OOO on his first
lot of traps.
* * * *
The initial success of the device was sen-
sational. For the first few weeks burglars
fairly poured through the staircases of
the rich. The war lost its place as a topic
of chief interest. The first breathless ques-
tion flung at the bearer of the morning tea
invariably was: “Any more arrived?”
During breakfast nothing ' was seriously
discussed but the appearance, kit. weapons,
etc., of the unhappy beings, sitting blas-
phemously in their prisons beneath the
stairs. Sympathetic folks, mostly females,
began to take a personal interest in their
burglars. They provided mattresses for them
to fall on, and they left food, drink, cigar-
ettes, chocolates and other little luxuries
in the corners of their cages. An organisa-
tion on the lines of the Red Cross: was
started. Arrangements were made to visit
the burglar’s family, and see that it did
not want; to provide the members with
paper, envelopes and pens wherewith to
write to the burglar during his incarcera-
tion ; to employ counsel to defend him, and
so on. The social life of the community
threatened to become revolutionised. A
special corps of police had to be told off
to collect the matutinal catch. The busi-
ness of the Criminal Courts became con-
gested. A Judge collapsed from overwork.
And then, suddenly, the bottom fell through
the whole business. Gossip and the press
had done their work. The burgling profes-
sion, grown wise to the situation, took to
avoiding staircases ' back and front, as
though they were infernal machines.
“I saw it coming a fortnight ago,” said
Jimmy to his father on the day the papers
noted the first serious diminution in the
morning haul. “I shall call the C.L.S.C
together for next Wednesday.”
To the society, which was now in a mood
to hang on his every word, Jimmy spoke
as follows: —-
“Ladies and Gentlemen, I have gloomy,
and at the same time heartening news for
you. Our burglar-trap is played out. In
the whole of the city and suburbs last night
only two burglars were taken by it. Both
are from the hack country. One is sus-
pected of being half-witted. By to-morrow
I venture to say the tally will be nil, and
so on for many a long dav to come. Carpers
may, no doubt will, say that the device
which so many of you have installed is now
useless; they may even go so far as to
argue that it represents a foolish invest-
ment. As against that consider its record.
In little more than "a month it has been
instrumental in capturing 306 burglars,
among them Flash Harry Bligsome, Her-
vey Nokker, and other masters of their call-
ing. It has given us all, if I may say so,
a good deal of innocent fun. And the traps
still stand as so many insurances against
the violation of at least the upper parts
of our homes. I venture to say that at
£l9 13s. 4d. per trap you have had a fair
return for your money. (Loud and pro-
longed cheering.)
“Unfortunately the curse which we are
banded together to exterminate is still with
us. Nine robberies were reported, last
night. But, ladies and gentlemen, every
one of them was a downstairs affair. I
have here a sample of a drug, made from
a rare South American leaf, that was shown
to me by a member of a native firm when
I was in Lima last year. A consignment
of the leaves, which I cabled for some time
ago, has just arrived. The action of the
ordinary sleeping draught is, as you pro-
bably know, slow. The peculiarity of
Punta-Varella, my drug, is that it fells
whoever takes it like a pole-axe, renders
him helpless for 24 hours, and at the end
of that time leaves him, if not exactly
comfortable, at least in good health.
“What I would suggest is that each of
you take over a supply of Punta-Varella
from me —I must warn you that it is expen-
sive—and use it as you think best. A
decanter of port, or a few of those beer
bottles which have a clip instead of a cork,
if left carelessly about, would prove a
deadly lure to most criminals. Doctor the
liquor with the drug and you will get your
man every time.”
• * * *
For a while it was as though the halcyon
days of the past had come back to the
houses of the well-to-do. Every morning
there was a dishevelled rush to the dining-
room to see what manner of game the
alcohol had brought down. The young men
of the family took a virile pride in drag-
ging the defeated miscreant into the wash-
house. The ladies examined the grim im-
"plements of his trade with delightful little
shrieks of dismay. There was the excite-
ment of ringing up friends to let them

HUSBAND, WlFfc AND CHILUi.Eri CUVtREii—NEARLY DjIIVEN
CRAZY WITH IRRITftTIOtl —2 YtARS’ MISERY ENDED.
WHAT person, seeing the Towers family for the
first time, and noting their clean, healthy
skins, would think that a short time ago
father, mother and children were all ravaged by
that dreaded disease, eczema? But, thanks to the
excellent disease-destroying powers of Zam-Buk,
they all now enjoy perfect skin health. Speaking
of their terrible experience, Mrs. Elizabeth Towers,
Id. Rooney Street. Burnley. Melbourne. Vic., says:
“We came from the country to reside in the town,
and the different climate and the great change in
diet considerably upset all our famay. The conse-
quence was that we all broke out m a nasty rash.
Inis rash developed into terrible eczema. Myself,
husband and cinidreii were all attached by tiiis
awful disease. 1 was covered with it almost from
head to foot, and felt as if 1 could tear myself to
pieces. The torture from the itching was almost
unbearable. All of us were afflicted in the same
way; not one of us could set any sleep
at night. I felt like going mad, the
irr.tauon was so dreauiul, and I was
much worse than the others. Not one
of us could keep our hands off the
affected parts. The want of sleep af-
fected us all. and I was nearly half
dead.
“A doctor gave me a sleeping draught,
which brought me a brief respite from
all the agony of irritation in blissful
oblivion. My husband became very
had, and it was pitiful to see him. l'or
weeks and weens he was laid up, unable
to work, and the children could hardly
walk. We attended the hospital, but
although they tried many things,
nothing gave us the least relief, and we
became worse if an> thing.
“My eldest boy was practically smoth-
ered in disease. A pin’s point could not
he placed between the affected spots.
We despaired of ever being well again.
For two years were we tortured and we
never thought the misery of it would
cease. When things seemed at their
worst, we read of some remarkable cures
of eczema by Zam-Buk Balm and Zam-
Buk Soap. We resolved to try this
treatment, purchased a supply, and all commenced it. In a
short time all of us were del glited to notice a wonderful dif-
ference. The irritation was ended and the soothing and healing
a< lion of both the Balm and the Soap were felt. The inflam-
mation was drawn to a head, and all bad matter expelled. As
we persevered with the Zam-Buk treatment, so we improved.
Tlie sores were healed, we were able to sleep at night, and soon
were completely freed from a terrible disease. Now we all
possess fine, healthy skins, which are w'onderfuily clear and

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,”* and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its accion is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

sensation of haAing done a public service.
But once more the tongue of Rumor— aided,
on this occasion, by that curse of our mod-
ern civilisation, the teetotal burglar—inter-
vened. The remnants of the profession
became as vvary of strong drink as they
Avere of staircases.
The originator of the O.L.S.C. Avas at
Menzies with Stensfield, the big Melbourne
doctor, on his Ava 1 ' through to Nepaul.
“They tell me, Jimmy,” said the doctor,
“that you haven't left a housebreaker within
50 miles of Sydney.”
“I wouldn’t quite claim that,” said Ful-
ton, with a diffident smile. “But I will .say
that our last effort —er —discouraged ’em
badly.”
“What Avas it?” asked Stensfield. “The
papers Avere strangely silent.”
“They AArnre,” said Jimmy. “They behaved
Avell over our last coup. All they needed,
of course, Avas to have the importance of
being a bit more reticent impressed on them.
We used poison gas.”
“Wlia-at?” cried the doctor.
“Poison gas,” said Jimmy, his sallow face
lighting up Avilh enthusiasm. “It was the
greatest thing you ever saw. Professor
Me Bain, »f the University, made it for me
from the remains of the Punta-Yarella
and some things of his own, and,” reflect-
ively, “Avhat was more, he did it for noth-
ing. The poor old burglar opened a desk
or a bookcase, or picked up a harmless-look-
ing piece of plate, ar.d whoosh ! a colorless
cloud, Avith just the faintest cdor of mag-
nolia, got him in the face. He came to in
the prison hospital the following night. Of
course it avhs rather like shooting a sitting
bird. The prey had no chance. There Avas
no sport in it. But the results!
“Well. Ave got Ike Fram, Chiller Argali and
Pal Mordaunt in the first week. None of
the gassed returned to tell the tale in the
nature of things. The accomplice, if he Avas
anywhere near, usually Avent under him-
self. We took them in pairs in about 20
per cent, of cases, and to show you the
range of the stuff they were often as much
as six feet apart. Where the other burglar
came in and found his mate apparently
dead, and Avith nothing to show why, he
did not wait to investigate. He simply
fled, leaving both his plunder and the tools
of his trade behind him. By the end of the
month the profession was practically down
and out —literally frightened to death. That
Avas in Julv last. It is now November, and
in all that' time there hasn’t been one seri-
ous robbery in the city or suburbs ’
“I oxpect you didn’t do too badly out of
it, Jimmy,” said Stensfield.
“Well, I admit I’m not so broke as I
was,” and the young man’s face Avas illu-
mined by a thoughtful smile.
J. B. D.
The River.
[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
ON, on! Faster, faster! Feverishly
he spurred bis tired hack. His
pack-horse Avas a lather of sweat
and blowing badly, but he must push on
—mile after mile through the rich
bloodAVOod, apple and ash flats, over the
stony, ironbark ridges, past lagoons cov-
ered from sight by Avaving masses of pink
and purple Avater-lilies. Wild duck, plain
turkeys, kangaroos, wallabies and an occa-
sional mob of Avild pigs—past them all un-
heeding. No time for shooting, this; and,
besides, he’d had enough of shooting.
Shooting! Well, Avhy shouldn’t he shoot?
And what if it was a steer? You couldn’t
expect a man to buy beef all the way from
Rockhampton to the Towers. It was these
Havs, capitalistic laws —they’d give a man
liA'e years for the sake ol a bit of beef. But
if they reckoned he Avas going to take it
lying dOAvn —well, they’d find out their mis-
take.
Anyway, what did that stockman want to
come nosing around for? Any darned fool
ought to know better than that. Of course,
he had to shoot; what else Avas he to do?
It Avas just his rotten luck that the shot
didn’t do the bloke in, and he had to finish it
Avitli his butclier’s-knife. It seemed ghastly—
near murder. Borne chaps might call it mur-
der. Yes. he Avislied iioav the shot had
finished it. Or lie might have risked
another, and kept liis hands clean. How
sticky it Avas! But, then, how was he to
know that a party of musterers mightn’t be
somewhere handy? And. God knoAA'S! one
Avail enough.
The river ought not to be far away now.
Once across that he could breathe easier.
V os, he would camp for an hour or two the
other side, and by to morrow night he could
be half-way up the range. Once on top of
the range lie could' fossick round for a bit
of tin and keep out of sight for a month or
two.
Didn’t knoAV the river was such a long
Avay. It would be dark in another ten
minutes. And his paekhorse was stumbling.
It Avas a bit of luck having the full moon.
A good job lie knew the river pretty well,
too. Quicksands were bad in places. But
up at the rocks there Avas a good stony
bottom right across. And, anyway, with
only those few bits of showers there would
be only a narrow stream running under the
far bank.
What Avas that? Bounded like running
Avater ! Yes, thank God ! Here Avas the
river at last!
But Avhat a row it was making! His
nerves must be going crook on him. He
Avould be able to see the sand, a Avide stretch
of sand, directly.
Yes, there it Avas! Baud! My God!
Water! The river a hanker! A mile and a
quarter of solid, broAvn, creamy, foaming
water!
What a fool he’d been! But how was he
to know? Why, they must have had a foot
of rain higher up.
How cold and cruel and dark they looked,
these flood waters in the moonlight! Bah—
i * :-ves again ! Could he, dare he attempt
the crossing? No question of could—he
must.
Of course, he could. Why, only the last
flood they took a mob of fats across....
Wasn’t that the time,' though, one of the
drovers.... But a ’gator got him, they said.
And they didn’t cross at night, either; and
’ gators —didn’t they reckon ’gators Avere
Avorse at night?
Well, if they were, it Avas no use thinking
about it. It had to be faced. He could
ride in front and lead his paekhorse till it
got to a swim, and then he could let the hack
swim ahead and hold on to his tail. The
paekhorse? Well, the paekhorse would
never do it. But so much the better. If
they found him dead they might think the
Avliole lot had been drowned and not bother
tracking any further.
Noav, then, neck or nothing. It wouldn’t
be very deep for a good Avay yet... .Cold !—-
Supposing he got the cramps!
Those nerves!
It was getting deeper—he’d have to let the
paekhorse go. How the poor devil grunted
—pity to see a good horse drown. But. ...
lucky enough if he made the other side him-
self. „
His saddle horse was a good swimmer . . . .
no, he must get off to lighten the weight.
Ugh ! It was cold. What a trip ! What a
SAvim ! And at night!—yes, they said they
Avere worse at night.
What was that! What a row a horse
made swimming! And ’gators could hear a
minnow splashing!
Supposing a ’gator was following them up.
Watching him. . . .with jaAvs like a great foul
trap
Supposing—huh, no, only a dead stick
poking up out of the water.
It teas coming nearer! My God!
**. * *
And a shriek Avas cut in two!
II.
The Closed Door.
[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
I.
BROWN was the cloak o’er his shoulder
thrown,
Brown were his buskins high,
And he held in his fingers a rose half blown,
And the knights as they rode by
Whistled their goshawks and laughed, and
swore
That he stayed for aye by a fast-closed door.
But some day he knew, as a child believes
In a Christian God who is always kind,
A latch would rustle the clinging leaves,
And a hinge would creak in the door
behind,
And the dust of ages would- break and rise
As incense under his eager eyes;
That a tress of hair would be outward blown,
He would hear the drag of a silken gown,
And there where he waited all alone
The cruel barrier would hurtle down,
And the oaken panel swing, to show
A jewelled throat or an arm of snow.
Perchance it would come on some moonlit
night,
When the hills were purple along the sea,
And the moat was guarded by mist-ghosts
white,
And the stars were a golden argosy,
He would hark to heralds of happier fate
In a handle’s turn, or a hinge’s grate.
Or belike an eve when the wild grey rain
Washed mosses out of the castle wall,
Drove like robber hordes on the beaten plain
And dripped despair from the poplars tall,
Through the moaning wind and the dead
leaves’ drift
A light would flicker, a wet latch lift.
Or a summer’s end that was dark and warm.
No moon galleon in breathless skies,
Hills low and sullen Avith threat of storm,
And by the shingle a seamew’s cries,
Where the pale moths circled in languorous
play
A hand might hover, more white than they!
ii.
’Twas a night of roses, sick-sweet with love,
A night of passion and tender dew,
When the thrushes dreaming in boughs abOA r e
Heard a mailed footfall breaking through,
As he trampled the bluebell in the glade
And shattered the laurels’ pavisade.
Did he see, I wonder, a brown-cloaked form
Couched in the grass by the fast-shut door?
Oh! his was a brow of force and storm.
And he stepped like a king on the marbled
floor —
And a greedy night moth, poised to sup,
Blew back, unslaked, from its honey cup !
And the ivy, slmpen like outspread hands,
Stirred too, and swung from the old grey
wall.
And the ficus loosed from the latch its bands,
Erect, as though to a bugle call.
While little hare feet on the inner floor
Came like falling petals towards the door!
111.
Butterflies, born with the limpid day,
Yellow things, as a shred of sun,
On a lily’s bosom they swooned away,
For the wanton lily lo\ r ed every one !
And stiff-rosetted, like ladies’ frocks,
Shone the gaudy pinks of the hollyhocks!
Trailing ivy athwart the ledge,
One spray severed as if by steel,
Sharp and clean on the dusty edge.
Deep imprint of a mailed heel—
Doors fast barred and windows black,
But the foot that ventured had not com-
hack.
iv.
Brown was the cloak o’er his shoulders
thrown,
Brown were his buskins high,
And he held in his fingers a rose full-blown,
And he watched the world go by,
A-tid the world was a death-march , strange
and grim,
For the door had opened—hut not for him.
