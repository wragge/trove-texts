ONE MORE
WEEK
GOLDEN SLIPPERS
A MELBOURNE WOMAN recently
paid $12 for a pair of shoes for her
son and then had the scatterbrained
notion of sending him to school in
them. In two weeks the soles parted
from the uppers, and then it fell to the
lot of the salesman from whom she
had bought them to explain that the
shoes should not have been used for
school but kept for best.
POWER FUSE
THE FUSING of art and science ex-
pressed in the Power Bequest Collec-
tion’s kinetic exhibits brought about a
fusing of another kind before the ex-
hibition’s Sydney opening. Shortly be-
fore the official guests were due to
arrive, Dr. Donald Brook, of Sydney
University’s Power Department of Fine
Arts, staggered in carrying a large card-
board box full of light bulbs bound
for Austrian artist Lily Greenham’s
exhibit, Study in Visual Perception.
This exhibit, made of wood and tiny
squares of green and purple paper, is
viewed from one end of a dark tunnel
and depends for its effect upon reflected
light. So a collection of colored bulbs
had been set up to throw different
colors on to the exhibit, but electronics
is as complex a business as art, and
all but one set of yellow bulbs had
fused. Hence Dr. Brook’s last-minute
flight for reinforcements.
‘‘When it’s set up properly, it will go
for about half an hour without repeating
a sequence,” Terry Smith, a tall,
bearded teacher from the Power Insti-
tute, explained as he moved on to Julio
le Parc’s Continual Mobile, an exhibit
you also have to work at —deciding
which set of colored plastic tags you
want to hang against which colored
background. For the opening, it was
wearing silver on white, but as Mr.
Smith explained as he slid the white
background across to reveal a choice
-of five other colors and in the ex-
hibit’s base, a neat set of drawers hold-
ing six varieties of plastic tags.
It was all part of kinetic art’s prin-
ciple of audience participation, Pro-
fessor Bernard Smith, the Institute’s
director, explained as we sat in noisy
companionship with Jean Tingueley’s
Sisyphus clattering and rocking on the
floor beside us. “Tingueley is a Swiss
constructionist who’s interested in the
-extension of art into the materials of
the industrial world. Sisyphus is a
kind of wry joke — it looks like a
machine, yet it has no use. It just
exists to be enjoyed.”
SUMMIT MEETING
WE WERE LATE for the Press in-
spection of Sydney’s Summit restaurant
because of an earlier appointment with
the Power Bequest Exhibition, 41 floors
below in the towering Australia
Square building and because of a brave
but futile attempt to journey those 41
floors direct by lift.
After some Kafkaesque experiences
with flashing red exit signs, mysterious
concrete corridors leading nowhere, and
a series of disturbing lifts which went
about eight floors each and refused to
go any farther, we reached the 32nd
floor in some triumph, only to be
told by a faintly amused cleaning
woman that one could not, at this
stage, go from the 32nd floor to the
47th but must take a lift back dowm
32 floors and try again.
Admirably reining in feelings of
fury and frustration, we did — to be
shot up the 40-odd floors in 27 seconds.
But even this super-efficient, high-
speed piece of equipment had some of
its colleague’s stubbornness. It went to
46, not 47.
But beyond that — the Summit, a
world of deep carpets, breathtakingly
circular harbor view, and gold Harry
Seidler ceiling. With a nice sense of
tact, or perhaps of prudence, Seidler’s
design has placed the bar on the
stationary side of the revolving floor.
“People like to have something that
hasn’t moved to come back to,” the
PR man explained quite seriously.
He then dispensed red-and-white
boxes of Summit matches and roneoed
sheets headed “Facts and Figures at a
Glance.” The Summit, it said, was the
highest revolving restaurant in the
world, had cost $500,000, seated 330
people, and the floor, operated by “a
complicated system of gearing and other
machinery,” revolved once every If
hours.
He couldn’t quite remember who’d
thought of inviting Sir Edmund Hillary
to open the Summit. But anyway, he’d
rung him. Sir Edmund had said to give
him a month, and sure enough, after
a month, he’d rung to say it was on.
Atzmon ... businesslike
EASY DECISION
ACCEPTING the post as chief con-
ductor of the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra had been “an easy decision,”
Moshe Atzmon, the young Israeli con-
ductor, told his Sydney Press confer-
ence.
“That wasn’t the impression you gave
me,” growled Talbot Duckmanton from
the sidelines. “I must be businesslike,”
a grinning Mr. Atzmon returned. Actu-
ally, Mr. Duckmanton, the ABC’s
general manager, elaborated, the whole
matter had been decided over a memor-
able lunch in London in July. Mr.
Atzmon, who is here as a guest con-
ductor this time, will take up the
appointment in March next year under
a three-year contract which specifies he
spend six months of the year in Aus-
tralia.
And why had the decision been so
easy? “I like the orchestra—its team-
work, which is its main strength—and I
think it will be possible for us to find a
good common language,” he said.

This English Water Spider makes a net, takes it
below the water's surface and fills it with air.
Without ClG's oxygen-making equipment,
she manages to live, breathe and breed under
water in comfort.
Our customers, however, prefer the convenience
of CIG oxygen, or many of our other gases in
use today for industrial and medical purposes.
There's acetylene, hydrogen, nitrogen, propane,
argon, nitrous oxide, cyclopropane and the
"rare gases" krypton, xenon, neon and helium.
We produce and supply Australia's needs
and still have enough left over to export.
Unlimited quantities of CIG oxygen are available
as compressed gas in cylinders, as liquid in
tanks and direct by pipeline in gaseous form
from plant to site. Metalworking processes require
our acetylene, too, to produce one of the hottest
flames known to man, 6000° F.
The main source for many of our gases is the
atmosphere. Over the past 57 years we've plucked
millions of tons out of thin air. But don't worry.
There's plenty left and nature's topping it up all
the time. For us, you, and the water spider.

Ancient India used stone to build specta-
cular temples. In contrast, modern India uses
concrete with equally spectacular results. To
the fabulous designs of le Corbusier, famous
architect, a new 20th century city has risen
at Chandigarh.

isn't even half of it
Every region of India has its own distinc-
tive ivory and silverwork, fine wool stoles
and rugs. You’ll find saree silk in a thousand
colours and weaves—at low prices. The
iriendly Indian people (and you’ll meet so
many!) will help you choose.

The Periyar sanctuary teems with elephants.
Take photographs from a launch; catch
unforgettable wild-life scenes. In the same
region are pleasant waterways, sandy beaches,
a thousand ancient temples, festivals and
classical Indian dances.
Today you can stay in luxurious, modern,
air-conditioned hotels lor as little as $lO.OO
a day, including first-class meals. In smaller
hotels you’ll find cleanliness, comfort and
wonderful, helpful service—at even lower
rates.
Even when you’ve seen the Taj Mahal (and you must)
you’ve still a whole world to explore in India, land of
infinite variety. In every region of India there are fascin-
ating differences, not only in climate and scenery, but in
the people, their customs and dress, in their festivals and
dances, arts and crafts, architecture and occupations.
Today you don’t need mosquito nets and bearers, topees
and all the rest of it. India has moved into the twentieth
century, with air-conditioning, filtered pools, cool restaur-
ants and inviting bars.
Where once caravans took weeks to cross the country,
there are fine highways, air-conditioned trains, jet-equipped
wternal air services among the busiest in the world.
MODERN
And your money buys so much in India (8.40 rupees
to the dollar!). Modern accommodation, meals, sightseeing
and incidentals needn’t cost more than $12.00 a day! And
think of the bargains you can find in the bazaars . . .
We haven’t changed a bit. Indians are still the most
hospitable, courteous and friendly folk. You’ll feel
welcome. Commonwealth citizens need no visa, no foreign
dictionary. English is spoken throughout the country.
That’s why India’s helpful Tourist Service makes you
this offer. Just tell them what kind of people you like;
where your interests lie. They’ll arrange introductions—
to Indian families at home, to business people, students,
men and women in all walks of life. You’ll find friends in
India. And you’ll learn so much more about this fascinat-
ing ancient-yet-modern country.
And modern India is so easy to get to. International
shipping and airlines call frequently at cities conveniently
close to the centres of interest. Ask your travel agent
about India—or contact Government of India Tourist
Office. There’s so much more to tell you than
we can possibly include here.

conductor last year over the issue of
musicians’ conditions went without
reference during the conference, but the
thought of it did prompt someone to
ask Atzmon how extensive his duties
would be. “There are terms in the con-
tract, but they’re meaningless when it
comes to such detail. This is something
that will have to be worked out as we
go along.”
Atzmon, short and volatile, with thick
black hair, was born 36 years ago in
Hungary, but his family, scattered dur-
ing the war, were reunited in Israel,
where he grew up. These years were
spent on a kibbutz learning everything
from farming to music, but he can’t
remember a time when he didn’t want
to be a musician.
He played French horn in the Israeli
Army band, then in Israeli orchestras,
studied at the Tel Aviv Academy of
Music, and finally went to England.
There, things happened very quickly,
and in the space of six years he has
earned an impressively international
reputation. “I have a home in Israel,
my wife and children live in London,
but mostly I live in hotels. A strange
family life, I’m afraid, but I feel if I
can be happy with what I am doing,
then my family can be happy. If I
stayed in one place just to please them,
then none of us would be happy.”
ALBERT ON HIS WAY
“ALBERT SEBASTIAN” is a “young
adult’s magazine,” so his cover says, and
he costs 30 cents. He is very fond of
people like Engelbert Humperdinck,
The Seekers, a girl called Sandra
McGregor all the way from Victoria,
Australia, and Red Cross concerts for
a charitable cause.
His young master, philosophy student
Andrew Charles, has now turned to
more serious things. Newly launched
in Melbourne is his latest newspaper
venture unpretentiously called “The
Melbourne Times.” A weekly in black
and white —lots of white— the “Times”
hopes to break the other Press barons
by selling in thousands each issue. The
politics are moderate to conservative,
the pictures are large, the coverage
comprehensive—football to metaphysics
—the views sensible, the news stories
unincisive. The betting against a first
birthday for “The Melbourne Times”
is 20 to 1 a few yards up the street
in the offices of the “Herald” and
“Sun.”
IN THE FOOTSTEPS
“YOU HAVE to grab the beast by
the throat,” Andrew Field, the Ameri-
can author of “Nabokov: His Life in
Art,” told us apropos his determina-
tion, in writing that highly praised
book, to read every single word, even
in Russian, on his subject. Back in
Sydney after several months abroad,
Field was on his way to the University
of Queensland, where he teaches Rus-
sian. (“America nowadays is a good
place for Americans to be out of.”)
Cossack-bearded, very assured, extra-
ordinary still, with composed sharp eyes
behind spectacles cut beautifully into
ten sides, his wife in equally perfect
and rimless circular glasses, Field
spoke of his meetings with Nabokov
(“It’s pronounced Na-BO-kov”) in
Geneva with considerable quiet en-
thusiasm. Nabokov, the Fields disclosed,
lives in a complete floor of his Geneva
hotel, “a bedroom, a marble bathroom,
a bedroom, a marble bathroom.” Nabo-
kov had brought out lacquer boxes con-
taining the outsize cards on which he
was writing his new novel, “Ada,” set in
Switzerland, plot undisclosed, and had
bounced them on his knee joyfully like
successive babies before returning them
carefully to a sacrosanct cupboard.
Field added: “Gogol stopped at the
hotel, it’s said, and Tolstoy is supposed
to have got VD from a maid.”
The Fields had called on the Nabo-
kovs at Christmas, when McGraw-Hill
had just bought the author from Put-
nam for a quarter of a million dollars,
and agents and publishers’ men were
milling about. In writing his book,
Field had travelled all over Europe,
unearthing rare material, such as an
article attacking Freud that appeared
in a tiny emigre newspaper published
in Paris. Field had even succeeded in
finding Nabokov’s juvenilia, including
lyric poetry, through a friend in Mos-
cow, and two plays which Nabokov
had forgotten from his vast oeuvre.
One fact which Field discovered re-
cently was that Nabokov had almost
come to Australia as an immigrant after
his early marriage. “He considered
starting a sheep farm,” Field said. “I
showed him a book on Australian but-
terflies, and he said, ‘Australian but-
terflies are a speciality of mine.’ ”
An aristrocrat by inheritance and cast
of mind, Nabokov doesn’t actually call
himself a great writer, but, Mrs. Field
put in, “he concedes it.”
Field, accused of being Nabokov
himself in a notorious review of his
study by Alan Brien in the “New
Statesman,” has no such ideas about
his own writing, but is embarked on a
novel of his own, “Fractions,” a satire
on America and American writers. “In-
fluenced by the Master? “No, I wouldn’t
say that,” Mr. Field said firmly, glasses
glinting, and added with enviable con-
fidence: “The publisher? I let my agent
take care of that.”

Hitachi has long been an active participant in the technical
revolution brought about by the discovery of ways to put the
electron to work. Today, the company is firmly established as the
unsurpassed leader of Japanese industry. Its many-sided activities are
conducted in 19 factories, 3 research laboratories, and by the efforts
of 77,000 employees. Hitachi's 20,000 or so products cover a
tremendous range, from giant power generation installations, rolling
stock of all types, communications equipment, industrial machinery
large and small, down to familiar household appliances, and to the
most modern of solid state devices.
Hitachi makes constant efforts to further tame and train the electron
in order to develop new and better products for the|benefit of both

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
The cultural
benefits of a
really good row
JUST THE OTFIER day a touring
lady said to Eric Westbrook, director
of our National Gallery, “Oh, Mr.
Westbrook, with all your interests, how
can you bear to live so far away from
the centre of things.” Mr. Westbrook
replied: “Madame, this is THE centre
of things.”
All of us here, in our own unbiased
fashion, were grateful for that reply.
But is it generally realised in farthest
uncentral Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, and
Adelaide that Victoria’s Arts Centre is
due to open in June? There has been
practically no publicity. The real
trouble with the Arts Centre is that it
is ridiculously light on controversy. The
building was handed over on December
18 —precisely the time estimated when
the first of the contracts was signed
five and a half years before-—the cost
has not changed from $l4 million, and
the design is unaltered. What is needed,
desperately, is a row with the Victorian
Government, with Roy Grounds being
banished to darkest Eltham followed by
a citizens’ indignation meeting demand-
ing his return.
Eric Westbrook recalled the other
day the very beginnings of the Arts
Centre. He was travelling through
Germany by train with Mr. and
Mrs. Grounds and the time was
1960. Roy Grounds said he felt that
the building itself should not distract
from the works of art within. It should
be rectangular with a series of court-
yards. Fie borrowed Betty Grounds’
umbrella and drew a picture in the
dust on the floor of the railway
carriage.
Actually one was surprised to hear
that a German railway carriage sported
any dust at all, but Eric Westbrook
said the picture on the floor was just
the way the Arts Centre looks now.
From the outside it is stark, like a
Norman castle, or, even better, like the
Beechworth Jail. Roy Grounds has gone
for the utterly original, old-Melbourne
bluestone. He feels this bluestone looks
best if there is very little mortar used.
He has done better than that; there is
none. He has connected the large blocks
with stainless-steel pins.
The revelation comes inside. There
is more Victorian mountain ash than
you ever saw arid six miles of gallery
space. Just lately “walk-ins” have been
all the rage here. Now, in the gallery, it
will be possible to get fit and get cul-
tured at the same time.
The plot is to avoid fatigue, and this
is done by varying the scene to the
eye and varying the floor surfaces from
stone, to parquetry, to carpet. Then
there are the three open-air courtyards.
One has galleries all around, like the
balconies of an old Queensland pub.
This will be the place on a summer
evening for an open-air concert, play,
or jazz session.
Frankly, the thing to see is the Grand
Hall, 154 ft. long, 54ft. wide, and 60ft.
high. Until now our dear city has been
depressingly short of tourist attractions
—“Chloe,” our beloved Phar Lap, and
maybe the MCG—but this is really
something.
On one side there are long medieval
windows, and the entire ceiling is in
sculptured glass by Leonard French.
The natural light filters down and
makes a multi-colored pattern on the
gold carpet. The different glass pieces
represent birds, fish, serpents, and if
you are truly devoted you will do what
is de rigueur at the Sistine Chapel, lie
down on your back and contemplate.
Down the side there is a stone gal-
lery and the ceiling is supported by
long, thin, beautifully tapered columns.
Eric Westbrook thinks the Grand Hall
is the best thing that has been done
since medieval times.
Last week the grand move started
from the old place in Swanston Street,
known to us as Phar Lap’s stable. This
is a move that involves 200,000 pieces,
worth $26 million, and it will take three
months. Imagine the Americans making
a move out of Fort Knox. The arrange-
ments here are similar. Eric Westbrook
decided it would all be done daily
between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. “Better
security then,” he says, “and besides,
less chance of an idiot banging into a
load of vases in his sports car.”
Your correspondent., red-eyed, got
“The trouble with you lot you don't
appreciate real art...!”
himself out of bed at 3 a.m. to witness
this move. Police were everywhere, and
one learned of the fascinating secrets
of the security. All the best of the Ming,
the most precious of the Sevres and
such were packed into cartons, all coded
and scrambled with cartons of English
silver, Egyptian pieces, and whatever,
so that no more than one or two people
would ever know what was going in
one truck. Then for the locked trucks
there were only two keys, one at the
Latrobe Street end, one at St. Kilda
Road. There was a hot line between the
two galleries. As each truck went out
the line was open, and if it didn’t arrive
in three minutes the alarm went.
Then each truck was escorted with
a police car in front, a police car be-
hind, police on every corner, and traffic
lights synchronised all the way. And
hovering around everywhere was per-
haps Melbourne’s best-known police-
man, Reg “Eagle Eye” Henderson, the
man who can remember 100,000 faces.
Also on the job directing operations
was Eric Westbrook. Stoically he plans
to do his 3 a.m. stint right through to
June, plus his 9 to 5 job afterward.
Now that we have explained the magni-
ficent security arrangements, Great
Train robbers will be interested to know
that everything goes out the north door.
Last week there was a fantastic scene.
Jammed in altogether were the cartons
full of bits of Ming and Sung and
Chang, there were harpsichords, 12th-
century Italian chests, antique fenders,
and a number of auto harps. “They
were marvellous for 19th-century singers
who could warble but were unable to
play a single note, really the equivalent
of the modern guitar,” said Eric West-
brook.
Oh, there were other pieces. There
was a jaded “Venus,” who had some of
her broken belongings tied in a bag,
like a cut lunch, around her neck. The
tendency was to raise an eyebrow when
one noted that she was standing on a
pedestal labelled Madame Melba.
Then, also piously waiting, was
Murillo’s “Immaculate Conception”
and the vast “Banquet of Cleopatra”
by Tiepolo, worth at least a quarter of
a million. They are a little concerned
about the “Banquet.” It will take six
men to lift it and it might take off
like a spinnaker. Also waiting abjectly
in a corner was Longstaff’s picture of
our benefactor, Alfred Fenton. He sits
there gloomily on a garden seat, staff
in hand. One gets the impression he
doesn’t approve.
Your correspondent wandered off into
the large, elegant Stawell Gallery, the
home of so many gallery receptions.
That soon will be turned over to
Aboriginal pieces and bark paintings.
Then in the McCoy Hall, just past the
taipans, Indian bears, and elephant
skeletons, one found Phar Lap. There
he was in the 4 a.m. gloom, imperious,
proud, superb. When he has got rid of
all those lesser Canalettos, Tiepolos,
Rembrandts, Van Eycks, and Con-
stables, he’ll be master of the whole
damn building.


Everyone's up in armchairs...
For the right to stretch!
The word went round fast,
Executives told working-holiday daughters. Holiday makers
told grandmothers. Hitch-hiking males passed it on. The
BOAC armchair really is the most comfortable economy
class seat ip the world.
Suddenly everyone joined the BOAC sit-in.
And these days, the company is fun not to say varied
up in the armchairs.
All because BOAC went to so much trouble with the seat.
Made it roomier, softer, with lots of stretch-right-out leg
room. Contoured it so it fits you you don’t have to fit it.
BOAC have 10 .Armchair Flights a week out of Australia
to London and Europe. Seven a week West via India. Three
a week East •via the U.S.A.
So see your BOAC Travel Agent, BOAC or Qantas,
General Sales Agents for BOAC.
Join the army up in armchairs.
You’ll fit in.

From nowon BRADFORD COTTON MILLS LIMITED will be known as...
BRADMILL
INDUSTRIES LIMITED
an all-Australian company owned entirely by Australians. For some considerable time, we have
felt that the name Bradford Cotton Mills Limited did not clearly indicate the Australian identity of the
Company, nor the diversity of its operations. While cotton is still an important part of our business, the
Bradmill range of products covers every form of fibre and fabric wool, man-made and combinations of
every conceivable type of yarn. So it is no longer desirable to be known as Bradford Cotton Mills Limited. The
name Bradmill Industries Limited will carry us into the future on our never-ending expansion and research
into a wider application of better fabrics which will benefit all Australians.

Not living by
bread alone
in this bakery
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
THERE’S PATRICIA and Anne and
Eleanor and Lois, who’s brought her
dog Fellalj, and half-a-dozen other girls
in smocks and old shirts milling around
John Olsen’s Bakery Art School in
Paddington, putting on paint, taking it
off, spreading it with brushes, with
fingers and thumbs, some sticking up
collages, some putting up old artwork,
and all in a state of blissful concentra-
tion.
There is also Bill. Yeah, I’m the
odd-ball, he is saying to one of the girls
who is here for Mr. Olsen’s weekly
Wednesday lunch, but more than that
he will not utter. Well, you know men,
says this girl, actually he’s really very
sweet but prefers to keep himself to
himself.
And there is artist John Olsen. With
mutton-chop side whiskers, and dressed
in blue jeans and thongs and sweater
with a Pierre Cardin neckline. That is,
buttoned and collarless. Mr. Olsen is
usually to be seen in clothes of an
avant garde nature e.g., the off-
white suit and purple shirt he wore to
the Paddington roads inquiry, and
referring to that he says he really is
sincere about Paddington becoming an
artistic enclave. Already, since ' he
opened his school here last September,
there’s a bookshop there, stabbing a
cobalt-blue finger in the air, and an
Italian art shop there, and oh, hell,
a pane of glass falls from the window;
give Mr. Olsen a tack quick, someone,
so it doesn’t fall right out and break.
Oh, yes, and kill someone, too.
Also, this art school now has 50
part-time pupils, mostly married women
with the need for some creative outlet
other than cosseting bawling brats and
demanding husbands. It has 15 Satur-
day morning children and three full-
time teenagers, two of whom are on
Olsen scholarships, that is, they pay
$lO instead of $3O a term because they
show promise. What John Olsen needs
is $3OOO a year to run the place, and by
next April he’ll get it via a group of
businessmen who are setting up a trust
fund, but who they are is top secret.
Anyway, here is John Olsen survey-
ing his school with immense pride. Four
rooms in two storeys, painted in House
and Garden greige, an aftermath of
Peter Muller the architect, and his
damned fluorescent lighting, which he
had to change, and there are baker’s
ovens in which he roasted a whole pig
for the school’s opening party. Actually
he’s done little about publicity. He
wants the school to feel its feet, get the
pupils feeling at home before doing
that, you know, inspire confidence. One
is saying now she doesn’t sleep the
night before Wednesday, which is
Olsen’s teaching day, it’s agony: what
will John think of her work, it’s so
awful? That’s how they all are at the
beginning, says the master. It doesn’t
last.
It is just after one o’clock and Mr.
Olsen calls everyone to lunch, which
he prepared at home that morning and
brought in to school. Cod’s roe, pep-
pers, salami, cheese, red and white
wine. A ravenous bunch of women
descend with cries of pleasure. Odd-
ball Bill waits for a lull before he scoops
up some cod’s roe. “. . . Moloney’s
Cooking for Brides, I say you can’t
beat it,” says the wife of a professor,
jiggling up and down in a sky-blue
smock, “Moloney’s Cooking for Brides,
John, you know, Ted Moloney.” Sure
John knows. But do they know he is
illustrating a cook book for Madeleine
Thurston. No. Marvellous. Someone
asks John for his recipe for the peppers.
He writes it on the paper tablecloth.
I’ll say this, says a pupil, if we don’t
learn to paint we’ll jolly well learn to
cook.
“. . . and when the school really
gets going,” says Olsen over his own
lunch at the Mon Coeur, he’s opted
out of home-grown cod’s roe and orders
Piperade, “artists like Drysdale will be
calling in. Fred Williams already does.
Visits like this make pupils respond,
they feel in touch with art. Say, isn’t
it wonderful the way an omelet can
come out rounded, look at that.” The
omelet, says the manager, was the
first thing he learned to cook. You turn
it like a pancake and it will stay round.
“Look,” says Olsen, “this school’s a
bit of a dream of mine, you’ll not find
another like it anywhere. It’s inform-
ality creates more discipline, can you
see that? They all work the harder
because they don’t want to disappoint
me. Next week it’s still life and the
week after landscape.” Oh, goody,
Watson’s Bay, please, says a girl up the
table, then we can go to the Ozone . . .
Wednesday night is still-life, too, the
place is jam-packed. It could be des-
cribed as the most pungent class of
all, there’s wine at the end as well.
. . . Back at the Bakery there’s a
latecomer who’s missed lunch com-
pletely. Ah, she says, today she has a
feeling she’s going to paint something
exciting, she doesn’t know what, but it
will be exciting. What does John think
of that?

An Englishman’s word
is his welsh
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
THERE DOES NOT seem to be any
way in which anyone can excuse the
British Government’s action in shutting
the gates to the Kenya Irfdians who
hold United Kingdom passports. An
earlier government had entered into a
very clear commitment that these people
were United Kingdom citizens: a suc-
cessor government has now welshed on
this promise by rationing their entry
to such a low annual figure that they
now become effective U.K. citizens only
insofar as the U.K. Government decides.
In other words, Britain, having made
a promise, now finds it inconvenient,
so it has broken its word.
To judge this side of the matter it
is not necessary even to believe in racial
tolerance but simply that it is desirable
that governments should try to keep
some kind of good faith, so that their
actions do not become too unpredictable
and arbitrary. It seems obvious that
even if over a period of several years
all 200,000 of the Kenya Indians who
were given U.K. citizenship came to
Britain, this would not create problems
so great that such an advanced and
prosperous industrial nation as Britain
could not handle them. But the prob-
able inflow was smaller than that.
Why did the Government get into
such a panic? Partly for electoral
reasons Britain, the' mother of the
free, is also one of the many mothers
of racial bigotry. But, perhaps, also
partly as one of the symptoms of pres-
ent British claustrophobia. Shut in
among the dark shadows of their own
frustrated self-importance, the British
elites now seem to find some perverse
kind of pleasure in dropping responsi-
bilities. This helps create the illusion
that somehow their present economic
difficulties (which are entirely manage-
able) have been due to British gener-
osity to the world.
It has been the generosity of their
rhetoric, contrasted with the calculation
of their actions, that now gives them
problems (that have nothing to do with
the problems of their economy), and
most of these problems came from the
form they gave to their new Common-
wealth to conceal the real facts of the
collapse of their old Empire. If the
Commonwealth had been a genuine
democratic association of nations, com-
bining together for some specific and
practicable purposes, and therefore
with a limited meaning, it would have
done no harm and it might have done
some good. But its main function was
to bolster British self-importance. For
instance, the Queen had to be head of
it, to give it a business-as-usual look.
Its purposes had to be general, almost
indefinable, mostly rhetorical.
One of the chief elements of its
rhetoric was the idea of multi-racialism,
itself a noble idea, but an idea that
now takes on a hypocritical edge as the
British now profess to find its fulfil-
ment impracticable. The expectations
that this idea caused gave the Com-
monwealth life for a while: but the
disappointment of Britain’s later failure
to deliver the goods may finally prove
to be the thing that ends the Common-
wealth. They shouldn’t have promised
more than they could meet. First, in
limiting entry of members of Common-
wealth countries because too many black
men were coming in, the British with-
drew the earlier meaning they had
given to the “Commonwealth.” Now,
in limiting entry of United Kingdom
citizens because too many black men
are coming in, the British are withdraw-
ing even the ordinary meaning of
“United Kingdom citizen.” One can
at least hope that this might challenge
some of that superior-talking anti-
Americanism that is now an almost
automatic characteristic of the edu-
cated English. American racialism has
been one of the ways in which it has
been suggested that Brits are Better.
Can this belief now still be sustained?
It is surprising that there have been
few suggestions that the Australian
Government should make at least a
token gesture toward the Kenya
Indians. If the British think they can
absorb 1500 of them a year, on a com-
parative population basis Australia
could absorb 300 a year. Why not make
it 500? This gesture would be to the
benefit of those who came: and it
might also be to the benefit of the
British conscience. Given our right to
choose between immigrants, the assimi-
lation problem would be easy enough.
Against this, of course, it could be
argued that it is not our responsibility
to help Britain out of the messes it
gets itself into through its own fault,
and that the liberalisation of our immi-
gration procedures should be concerned
mainly with increasing the entry of
people from South-East Asia and Japan
and not be directed to other areas
by British mistakes. It might also be
argued that our action could embarrass
the British Government. But that would
seem to be an argument in favor of
action rather than against it.
Mr. Bury gets
his figures wrong
COMMENT
BY
PETER
SAMUEL
THE SPEECH Labor Minister Bury
made last week to the Chamber of
Manufactures meeting in Canberra
deserved the big publicity it got, not
least because of its inadequacies.
It was all right when he said that
the cumulative effect of present wage
claims could be disastrous, in creating
an economic crisis similar to that which
has plagued Britain in the past few
years. It was all right when he added:
“We ourselves have no reason to be
complacent, part i c u larly at this
moment,” and referred to the recent
metal trades decisions and the claims
for flow-on from these. He then became
rather commonplace when he reminded
us about the impossibility of having our
cake and eating it, and the need for
higher productivity. Beyond that, his
talk was a fizzer. Its importance lies
in the bankruptcy it demonstrates in
Government economic thinking.
For when he got down to detail, Mr.
Bury was either wrong or ineffectually
exhortatory. He was simply wrong in
his statement about what has happened
in the economy lately. Average wages
have not ceased to rise in real terms in
the past three years. Over that period
of time they have risen 11 percent. It
is true that during one of the past
three years they ceased to rise—during
1965-66. But that was due to reduc-
tions in employment and overtime,
associated with the edge coming off
the 1965 boom (motor-vehicle produc-
tion and building slumped quite badly).
It had nothing whatever to do with
defence spending.
Neither is it statistically factual for
Mr. Bury to declare that living stand-
ards have been rising less quickly. Per-
sonal consumption per capita in real
terms has been rising by about $l5 a
year over the past three years. This is
a slower rate of growth than during the
three years 1961 to 1964. But only be-
cause those were the years when the
economy was recovering from the deep-
recession of 1961. An increase of $l5
per capita in real personal consumption
is about double the rate for the 19505.
Mr. Bury’s colleague Mr. McMahon
had his facts straighter when he spoke
the evening before, quoting figures
released last week: “These indicated
that in (1966-67) real consumer spend-
ing per capita increased by 2.2 percent,
which compares with an average rate
of increase of 1.7 percent in the pre-
vious decade.” He went on to point
out that the growth of production as
a whole “has accelerated in the past
five years, holding to an average rate

of 5.5 percent or more than one per-
cent better than during the ’fifties.”
These facts completely undermine
Mr. Bury’s thesis that in the defence
build-up of the past few years eco-
nomic growth and living standards
have been sacrificed in the interests of
defence. The defence build-up has
simply not been big enough to have
any such effect. The annual increase in
defence has been $l7O million during
a period when national production
despite a bad drought has been
growing by $l6OO million. There has
also been an annual increase in expen-
diture on beer and cigarettes of $llO
million a year, making it almost as
sensible to attribute economic strains
on the fags and the grog as on the
Digs. Non-defence spending by the
Commonwealth Government has been
increasing by more each year, in abso-
lute terms, than defence spending by
an average of $4OO million a year. Edu-
cation expenditure and outlays on
Government subsidies have been rising
at almost the same proportionate rate.
If Mr. Bury believes that this coun-
try can be adequately served by an
army with the capacity to place three
battalions overseas, then let him argue
that on strategic grounds. There is no
economic case against a major expan-
sion of our Armed Forces.
When he came to wages policy Bury
moved from the inaccurate to the dis-
appointingly vacuous. He wants interest
groups to cease being themselves, to
cease acting energetically on behalf of
their members and to be guided by
some obscure doctrine about “the needs
of the nation.”
What is worrying is not so much the
emptiness of this wishful thinking but
Mr. Bury’s apparent endorsement of
the Arbitration Commission’s eco-
nomically irresponsible role. The Com-
mission is “essentially an adjudicator”
and it is not its function to “dream up
economic theories or seek to determine
the economic policies that the Govern-
ment should seek to pursue.” He is en-
dorsing the view that the Commission
can go on acting solely as an adjudi-
cator, bending its judgments to the
strongest industrial pressures (whether
they be on the union or employer side),
regardless of prospective economic con-
sequences. No one suggests that the
Commission “dream up economic
theories.” (The only area in which it
has done that is in the matter of work-
value, but Mr. Bury is of course not
referring to that.)
What economists are saying is that
in the interests of economic stability
and growth, the Arbitration Commis-
sion take full account of estimates of
the economic consequences of the judg-
ments it makes. Such estimates will be
basefl to some extent on economic
theories about the relation between
wages and prices. But the theory that
wages cannot grow faster than pro-
ductivity without putting pressure on
prices is a theory firmly based in fact.
Perhaps next time Mr. Bury gets his
facts wrong he might get some advice
from the Treasury.


AUSTRALIA
Australian defence
all options, no plans
HOPES THAT Prime Minister Gorton
might be a bit more of a hustler than
his predecessors are disappearing.
“There’s no tearing hurry about that,”
is becoming one of his favorite phrases.
He’s certainly in no hurry over de-
fence. In fact, it looks now as though
Australia’s defence planning is going
to go freewheeling on without a plan.
There was supposed to be a three-year
perspective plan ready to be announced
by the middle of this year. Now there
won’t be.
The plan, to which all three services
would have geared their activities, was
supposed to take effect by June 30. Its
basis was supposed to have been settled
by the end of last year. It got as far
as some draft submissions which were
almost ready to go to Cabinet early
this year when the accelerated British
withdrawal was announced. The drafts
were scrapped and the laborious pro-
cess of reworking was then supposed
to start again. But virtually nothing
has happened since then. It looks as
though the next defence budget may
be decided in a policy vacuum.
External Affairs Minister Mr. Has-
luck has been off to Kuala Lumpur,
Singapore, and Djakarta and said that
Australia will maintain its present
forces and might do just a little more.
But there is no firm Cabinet backing
for even that position. It is known that
Ministers are still receiving papers on
such general subjects as: “Malaysia/
Singapore options: Increase/status
quo/withdrawal.”
Mr. Gorton, of course, is on record
as saying that we will maintain a
presence in Malaysia, and presumably
he will not let down his Foreign Minis-
ter by undermining his promises. But
what he will possibly do is stall. Right
through the period of discussions of
British withdrawal the Australian Gov-
ernment has refrained from initiatives
to discuss arrangements for the post-
British period. Australia will attend
any talks it is invited to, but it will not
initiate any, was Mr. Holt’s theme. It
was then taken up by Mr. Gorton.
Late last year it was expected that
five-power talks on the accelerated
British withdrawal would be held in
February. Now it seems unlikely there
will be any before April or May, so
the policy framework for defence
planning in the Malaysia/Singapoi'e
area is not likely to be completed
befoie the budget in August.
It does appear, however, that a pre-
liminary policy statement on defence
is being hurried out in the next two oi
three weeks. This paper will provide
the basis for the Australian delegation s
posture at the Seato, Anzus, and Viet-
nam allies meetings in Wellington m
the second week of Apnl. It will a so
be used in a statement to Parliament
either by Mr Gorton or Defence
Minister Fairhall early in the session
of Parliament which opens on March
But there can be no doubt that it
will be a stopgap statement, attempt-
ing to leave all options open except
that of improving Australia’s military
strength. It will definitely not provide
the guidelines needed by defence
planners for the new three-year
defence program, setting targets for
troop strengths in the various services
and laying out the purchases of equip-
ment envisaged.
rrii . & , .. . A/r
I here is even speculation that Mr.
-L, r
Gorton may abandon the system of
defence planning mtioduced by Sn
Robert Menzies and Mr. Shane Palt-
ridge and return to year by year ad
hoc decisions. It seems certain that
the services will go into next financial
year not knowing their targets more
than nine months ahead.
The most important factor contri-
buting to this sloppiness in defence
thinking is lack of ministerial interest
or a sense of urgency. But it is also
reinforced by certain attitudes held by
prominent people in the defence-
foreign affairs bureaucracies. One is
a deep pessimism about the Ameri-
cans’ ability to see Vietnam through
to a successful conclusion, and a feel-
ing that Australia’s whole strategy of
forward defence through support of
Asian allies is crumbling. Another is
the sheer inefficiency of the Defence
Department. In many ways it is little
more than a collection of secretariats
for innumerable joint-service and inter-
departmental committees, which cum-
brously chew each others thin cud of
ideas. In many respects the External
Affaifs Department —biased by its
diplomatic bent against the use of
military power—determines defence
policies or non-policies through the
default of the Defence Department.
There are also little things that de-
bilitate work in the defence-foreign
affairs area. The constant rotation of
External Affairs officers between over-
seas posts and Canberra means that
External Affairs representatives on
defence committees lack continuity and
experience. The fact that the PMG
bungled the design of the telephone
exchange for the defence complex
means that telephones are often not
available. Officials from the External
Affairs and Prime Minister’s Depart-
ments complain that for hours on end
they are unable to contact the Defence
Department. A lot of time is spent
Former Army Minister Fraser (left) hands over to new Army Minister Lynch
(right) last week


travelling back and forth across the
lake with documents. And the fact that
the defence complex of buildings were
built without air-conditioning, hardly
builds morale or contributes to effi-
ciency in Canberra’s long hot
summers.
Meanwhile, with thought stagnant
on Malaysia-Singapore, the Govern-
ment faces a decision on whether Aus-
tralia should renounce nuclear weapons.
A draft “nuclear non proliferation
treaty” is being debated in Geneva
and the Australian Government will
soon have to state an attitude to it.
The External Affairs Department
thinks the treaty is a “good thing,”
and will probably urge the Govern-
ment to sign it. Independent university
experts say it is a weak treaty pro-
viding few inspection safeguards, and
think it is mainly to the advantage of
the Russians and Communist countries
which can violate it secretly without
any danger of being detected. Mr.
Gorton as a Minister for the Navy
spoke in the late 1950 s in favor of
Australia acquiring the bomb, but no
one knows what he thinks now.
The Defence Department is not
known to have any coherent views on
the matter.
Means Test
Compromise?
IF MR. GORTON is de-emphasising
the importance of defence in the scale
•of national priorities, it seems to be as
though he wants to be written up in
the history books as a national de-
veloper and liberal reformer. As liberal
reformer he must make things move
in the area of social services, health,
and welfare.
He has made a good start there by
putting the long-time urger of the back-
benchers, Mr. W. Wentworth, into the
portfolio of Social Services. For all his
.great political skill, former Minister lan
Sinclair was not an innovator. More
concerned to administer well and keep
out of trouble in the area of his port-
folio, Mr. Sinclair would not fight for
anything he wasn’t 100 percent sure he
could get. Necessarily, his energies were
devoted more to helping his leader,
Mr. McEwen, within his capacity as
Minister assisting the Minister for
Trade and Industry. He was also con-
cerned to stave off his rival for suc-
cession to Country Party leadership,
Mr. Anthony.
With no such ambitions or con-
straints, and possessing a deserved repu-
tation for energetic and original think-
ing, Mr. Wentworth is throwing himself
into the job. On his appointment, many
speculated about a clash between his
views on the Means Test and Govern-
New Social Services Minister Wentworth at his swearing-in last week
ment policy. His first words in meet-
ing the Secretary of his Department
were that he shouldn’t take any notice
of what the newspapers had been say-
ing. He had an open mind, and was
willing to hear all the proposals put up
to him.
But so far, Mr. Wentworth has been
a vigorous exponent of phasing out
the Means Test on pensions. This is
the policy of the Labor Party, and
probably would be supported by a large
proportion of electors. The Means
Test is what the students of propa-
ganda describe as a “boo” word, some-
thing people are against for emotional
reasons.
The abolitionists usually fail to face
up to the argument that the Means
Test is basic to the philosophy of Social
Services, which is, that they should dis-
tribute money from the well off to the
needy. Payment of pensions to old
people, regardless of their need, would
not be a progressive redistribution of
income from rich to poor, but simply
a tax on the young and middle-aged.
The cost of abolishing the Means Test
on pensions is estimated to be over
$4OO million, requiring a 25 percent
rise in the rate of income taxation. And
it would benefit not the most needy
section of old people, but the least
needy the richer proportion of re-
tired persons. It would also make more
costly any increases in the rate of pen-
sion payment made each fortnight, and
so slow down improvement in pensions
standards.
These are the arguments which are
going to be powerfully put to Mr.
Wentworth by his own Department of
Social Services and by the Treasury,
both of whom have many times past
had to deal with politicians eager to
follow the popular course of moving
toward Means Test abolition. There
is no political mileage to be had in
simply relaxing the Means Test further
by raising the income and property
levels at which it becomes effective.
There still persists a cut-off border,
and the border of discontent is
simply shifted along. Mr. Wentworth
may be looking at Professor R. Down-
ing’s compromise suggestion for a
tapering of the Means Test, whereby
only, say, 50 cents is deducted from the
pension for each extra $1 of income
—so wakening the disincentive effect
on earnings, and also blurring the
border of discontent.
Mr. Wentworth may decide to
examine the broader question of
national insurance policy, and the
portability of superannuation schemes.
Recent researches by independent
economists have shown the inefficiency
of the present system of subsidised
private Medical and Hospital Benefits
funds, which absorb up to 20 percent
of contributions in administrative
costs.
The research section of his depart-
ment is small —half a dozen officers—-
and its information pamphlets have
been criticised as difficult to compre-
hend. Mr. Wentworth is expected to
get staff increases in these areas to
allow him to generate an increased
flow of ideas on reforms, and produce
better information on what the Com-
monwealth already offers in the way
of cash benefits.
Until a week ago it was thought
that Mr. Gorton would amalgamate
Social Services, Health and Repatria-
tion Departments into one Social
Welfare Ministry, but like several
other Gorton schemes this one has been


delayed if not sunk by Public Service
opposition.
Mr. Wentworth, however, will be
in charge of a Cabinet committee to
examine rationalisation. The com-
promise most likely is the maintenance
of separate Departments and
Ministers, but a rearrangement of
functions. And, possibly, in the way
the Defence Department has overall
policy control over the Service de-
partments, Mr. Wentworth’s Social
Services Department may be granted
overall direction of the social welfare
group of Departments.
Canberra
Vietnam attitudes
OPINIONS IN THE Australian Gov-
ernment on the outcome of the Com-
munist TET offensive in Vietnam vary
just about as widely as they possibly
could. On the one side are the we’ve-
had-it, Westmoreland-must-go school,
and on the other extreme are those
who say it is the best thing that has
happened in three years.
The disillusioned in the Government
tend to include a number of formerly
overconfident people those who
thought that official claims that the
cities and two-thirds of the countryside
were'under Government control meant
that they were enclaves of security, as
impenetrable by the Viet Cong as Syd-
ney or Singapore. They now believe
that pacification, if it meant anything,
anyway, is finished, that the Vietnamese
Government apparatus is further
weakened, that Allied troops are pinned
down and have lost initiative. The
optimists tend, naturally enough, to look
more closely at Communist difficulties.
They rely mainly for their arguments
on the terrible beating the Communist
troops took. Here, of course, develops
a debate over the numbers killed.
No one takes the Westmoreland body
count figure of 40,000 literally. It is
thought to include double and treble
counting. And where to draw a line
between people killed while helping the
Communist troops and their regular
support elements? A figure of 7000
clearly confirmed and identified regular
enemy soldiers killed has been accepted
as the absolute minimum, and the hard
base figure for any estimate of Com-
munist troop losses. On top of this
7000 are added greatly varying esti-
mates of . killed local-force troops,
guerillas, combat support, and infra-
structure cadres. The lowest total figure
accepted by anyone in the Government
is 12,000, the highest General West-
moreland’s 40,000.
The pessimists argue that the Com-
munists in Vietnam have plenty more
reserves of manpower and that the
losses do not matter. The optimists
argue that they already have man-
power problems and that these will be
aggravated and must soon show up in
their overall military performance.
They claim that the losses are signifi-
cant qualitatively as well as quantita-
tively. Communists killed included
some of the best and most experienced.
Cadres who previously had remained
underground surfaced in expectation
of the popular uprising, and a large
proportion got caught.
Some of the optimists say that pacifi-
cation no longer matters very much.
The Communists in escalating the fight-
ing and waging stand-and-fight battles
have made the struggle for villages less
central to the conflict. The war is
now going to be determined like other
conventional wars of positional combat.
The super-optimists reckon that the
Communists are having to abandon the
struggle for control of the villages and
the population in order to mount
these big attacks on cities and bases, and
that they have transferred the conflict
generally to a plane at which we have
all the advantages. It is a one-way
street, they say.
An official assessment going to
Ministers is cautiously optimistic. It
reports that the Government and Army
of Vietnam reacted well to the offensive.
Contrary to the impression created by-
news stories, it says that the Vietnamese
Army “bore the brunt of the enemy’s
offensive.” It suffered no major defeat,
although some areas were initially lost
through surprise and the enemy’s con-
centration of significant numerical
superiority at key points. There were
no significant defections. Indeed,
soldiers on leave for TET and isolated
from their units rallied in sufficient
numbers to form special battalions.
Civilian reaction was initially shock
and apprehension. But there was no
general response to the Communists
call for uprising.
Initial reports to the Australian
Government suggested that pacification
workers in villages had suffered very
heavily, but these have proved wrong.
However, there is concern that teams
pulled out for relief work in the cities
may not be quickly enough returned to
the villages, and that confidence and
continuity will be lost and the whole
pacification program put in jeopardy.
The offensive is summed up as a “set-
back” for the Communists.
South Australia
The gerrymander
ONE OF THE proposals Premier Don
Dunstan put to the South Australian
electorate in last week’s elections was
that there should be wider representa-
tion for city over country. If that pro-
posal had already been made law, then
Mr. Dunstan’s Government would have
romped in.
With about 53 percent of votes cast,
Mr. Dunstan had a clear majority of
voters behind him, but not a majority
of seats. Unlike Mr. Renshaw, the
Mr. Dunstan, with wife, opens the cam-
paign
Labor leader defeated in the previous
week’s N.S.W. elections, who com-
plained about gerrymandering when
his party had only 43 percent of the
votes, Mr. Dunstan had a real griev-
ance against the electoral system.
It was a grievance that was partly
accepted even by the opposing Liberal
and Country League, to the extent that
while Labor was proposing a Lower
House of 56 members (instead of the
present 39), with a dismantling of the
bias in boundary distribution in favor
of country seats, the LCL opposition
said it would increase the Lower House
to 45 seats. It did not intend to remove
the bias in favor of the country, but
its proposals would lessen it. If even the
LCL proposals had been law, Mr.
Dunstan would probably have got a
majority.
As the boundaries now stand, 70
percent of South Australians, most of
them living in Adelaide, are repre-
sented by only one-third of the mem-
bers in the Lower House. The remain-
ing 30 percent, consisting mainly of
Adelaide’s country cousins, are repre-
sented by two-thirds of the members in
the Lower House. It was this set-up that
gave South Australia 30 years of LCL
government, broken only by the Labor
victory three years ago.
Privately LCL leaders are disap-
pointed with the small swing against
Mr. Dunstan. Against this slogan of
“Live better with Labor,” and his
record of social reform (late hotel clos-
ing, a lottery, TAB, commercial enter-
tainment on Sundays), they had at-
tempted to set up the feeling that these
frivolities could not be sustained without
sounder industrial growth and put up
the rival slogan “Get South Australia
moving again.” Perhaps the slight
swing away from Mr. Dunstan was an
expression of the puritan conscience.
Although it is doubtful that electors
really believed the phrase Prime Mini-
ster Gorton coined during the election
when he spoke of Australia’s “three
dismal years,” it is likely that there
was some response in their hearts to
the warning from LCL Leader Hall
that “up to this stage the Australian
people have been too preoccupied hack-
ing out an existence in a harsh environ-
ment to think too deeply about cul-
ture.”


The unions
Going for broke
LAST WEEK’THE word came through
from headquarters down the various
streams of information and their tribu-
taries that the Communist Party has
decided to “go for broke” in the present
outbreak of industrial warfare. The
expression may have emanated from
the nations leading the imperialist
camp, but “go for broke” was the
phrase used.
That the Party was making a major
reappraisal of its industrial position
became evident last year when one of
its senior full-time cadres, Mr. Bernie
Taft, was let loose on the union move-
ment before the Australian Council of
Trade Unions Congress. The much-
improved position of the Party in rela-
tion to the ACTU executive was partly
due to his efforts.
The postal strike, the metal trade
strikes, and the two Victorian power
strikes all owe a substantial part of
their motive force to the decision of the
Party to become more aggressive in the
industrial arena. The recent miscalcu-
lations of the Arbitration Commission
have presented the Party with excellent
openings for their attacks.
The four objectives of the present
wave of militancy are:
• The destruction of the arbitration
system (this had long been Communist
policy), or at least of the credibility of
that system in the eyes of the workers.
• The discrediting of the work-value
approach to arbitration (which the
Party considers dangerous because of
the high stakes which can be won).
• To provide a kind of psychological
contribution to the Vietnam war by
interference with production and com-
munications in Australia (the boys at
Ted Hill at a Peking rally
the World Communist Party Congress
can boast that they are doing their bit).
• To counter the strong allegations of
the extreme Peking-oriented Commun-
ist faction led by Ted liill that the
majority Moscow-line party is revision-
ist, powerless, and gutless in its atti-
tude to revolution.
In each of the most serious strikes
of December, January, and February,
a Communist or a well-known associ-
ate of Party members and policies has
been a leading figure, and at present
they have been successful enough to stir
significant groups of both blue- and
white-collar workers into a defiance of
arbitration.
The Government can reply by enforc-
ing the penal clauses of arbitration, by
making penalties against Public Service
unions more severe, by using the Essen-
tial Services Act, or by simply waiting
the militants out. There are difficulties
in any of. those courses. The penal
clause fines, for example, are only pro-
perly effective if they do not mount
too high. At $lOOO a day it is soon
possible for the fines to reach such a
figure that they become simply financial
fiction instead of a penalty. Past a cer-
tain point, as has been remarked in
another situation, all dangers are equal.
The problem for the Communist
Party is to widen the area of disputes
and at the same time maintain the
fighting morale of its battalions.
It must therefore try to stir up trouble
over the flow-on of wage increases
which many workers expect, but which
the arbitration commission says will
not be automatic. Such a move would
also be by corollary an attack on the
principle of work-value cases.
To take full advantage of the situa-
tion, the Party needs a stronger hold
over the ACTU, and there are now
signs that the even Left-Right split
which operates at the moment on the
ACTU executive may be resolved in
favor of the non-Communist ticket. Mr.
Jim Coleman, the Western Australian
delegate, is no longer prepared to toe
the Left line on all issues, and there
are signs that Mr. Petrie, the junior
vice-president, does not want to be per-
manently identified with the pro-
Communist forces.
For the Party the options are that
the ACTU may be used, embarrassed,
or by-passed in its new strategy of set-
piece industrial battles. But it is par-
anoic of Party officials to expect that
they can pull off a local Dien Bien
Phu. The big battalions are still on
the side of Mr. Gorton, Sir Henry
Bolte, and Mr. Monk.
Teachers
"Emergency" plan
VERY FEW SECONDARY school-
teachers in any Australian State have
the ideal minimum qualifications, three
years of tertiary education followed by
one year of practical teaching with
further study; and in Queensland fewer
than 10 percent of secondary teachers
have attained this level. Small wonder,
then, that the Queensland Govern-
ment’s Emergency Adult Teacher Train-
ing Scheme, which would allow “mature
adults with suitable qualifications” ta
become permanent secondary teachers
after only eight weeks of intensive train-
ing, has the State’s teachers in simmer-
ing revolt, believing that the scheme
would take qualifications in the opposite
direction.
The Queensland Teachers’ Union has
placed the matter before the State
Industrial Commission as “a state of
dispute which exists,” and hopes that
a resulting conference will block the
scheme without militant action. One of
the coalition Government’s nominal sup-
porters, Liberal MP John Murray, has
described the scheme as “a panic meas-
sure, hastily conceived, improperly intro-
duced, and impracticable,” and many
academics devoted to improving the
quality of the State’s secondary teachers
are equally strongly against it, and
equally puzzled as to where the “emerg-
ency” lies.
They point out that shortly before
Mr. Pizzey became Queensland’s
Premier, when he was still Education
Minister, he spoke of a healthy inflow
of teacher trainees, up 1000 on the
previous year, but not of any shortage
of secondary teachers. Earlier, he had
stated that more people were joining
the service than had left, that the exo-
dus of teachers to Canada was nothing
to worry about, and, to a Secondary
Schools Council, that “evidence showed
that the Education Department placed
great emphasis on student-teacher
training and the training of appointed
teachers.”
Yet, a very few weeks later a new
Education Minister, Mr. Fletcher, an-
nounced the scheme, “to meet an urgent
problem, shortage of secondary teachers
in 1968.” There were 77,000 secondary
students, only 5000 more than the pre-

vious year, and their numbers had been
growing steadily and predictably enough
since 1955, when there were only 11,000.
Said Mr. Murray, “If we raised the
pay and status of our teaching profession
and removed education from politics
into the control of an authority or com-
mission, we should never be faced with
such a dangerous emergency scheme as
this . . . which should be withdrawn.”
But the Minister persisted with its
defence. The eight weeks’ intensive
training would be followed by 26 weeks
of supervised teaching and five weeks
at summer school. “Some 40 weeks’
training,” he claimed. “The major-
ity will be at least two- or three-year-
trained teachers, taking all their quali-
fications into account.” Of the first 50
applicants, eight were graduates, while
others had “very high qualifications in
particular fields.”
In the cut and thrust which followed,
Teachers’ Union secretary G'rulke
pointed out 100 graduates would emerge
fully trained from teachers’ college this
year and go on to the same pay scale
as the “dilutees,” rising to $3160 a
year. “The Minister might have used
the necessary money to pay more to
retain in the service some of the teachers
now heading toward other places,
where higher salaries are paid and
better working conditions provided.”
And Liberal MP Murray commented,
“There might be some point if the
scheme were designed to bring in
emergency-trained teachers for a tem-
porary period of, say, two years.” Fin-
ally some of the applicants pointed out,
in newspaper letters, that most of them
might be married women who, with or
without degrees, were automatically
debarred from teacher-training pro-
grams, or young men with families who
could not live for a year on the allow-
ance paid during teacher-training.
A measure of the teachers’ antagon-
ism to the scheme can be had from a
list of questions handed to Teachers’
Union president Semple at a special
meeting of the Teachers’ Colleges
branch: would the executive organise a
demonstration, hold a strike ballot, call
teachers out without a ballot, direct
members not to lecture the emergency
trainees, and so on. The teachers were
told that if the approach to the Indus-
trial Commission did not succeed there
would be a general meeting to decide
on further action.
Although the teachers’ outcry has
been met with a degree of public apathy,
the Government cannot ignore it. The
comments of even one Liberal member
on the issue are a symptom of the coali-
tion’s shakiness arising from a fracture
within the Queensland Liberals. The
contest for ex-Premier Nicklin’s former
seat in the Landsborough electorate has
developed into a three-way contest,
with an unendorsed Liberal standing
against the Country Party candidate.
His supporters included the Party's
State president, Dr. Hartwig, who was
suspended last week. Discomfort within
the Government could lead the Premier
to prefer canning an unpopular scheme
to risking a fight with the teachers.

At London Airport, Kenyans happy to have scraped in through
the closing door
A protest note against exclusion of Asian holders of British
passports
Britain’s “natives” just
aren’t being civilised
“I DO NOT KNOW whether the new
Immigration Act will succeed in its
purpose, because the decision does not
lie wholly in this country,” the British
Home Secretary, James Callaghan, told
the House of Commons during the de-
bate on the Commonwealth Immigrants
Act. “It lies in the civilised behaviour
of other governments; let there be no
mistake about it. _
The other governments chiefly con-
cerned in the Act, designed to limit
to about 1500 a year the number of
Indians in Kenya who have British
passports from migrating to Britain,
are, of course, India and . Kenya.
Whether their behaviour is civilised
depends on what the British Home
Secretary means by civilised.
Kenya has introduced seven new
conditions to govern the issue of re-
entry visas for Asians but not for
Europeans who have left the country
since December 1. Existing re-entry
permits will be honored. Asians going
to neighboring Uganda or Tanzania
will be exempted from the conditions.
The aim is clearly to make it possible
for Kenya to determine which Asians
it is willing to receive back.
India has announced that Asian
holders of British passports would no
longer be permitted to enter the coun-
try, and that India reserved the right
to review the free entry of other Com-
monwealth citizens. (In the past India
has allowed free entry to British and
Commonwealth passport holders, ex-
cept Pakistanis, although the right of
permanent settlement has been re-
stricted.)
India is expected also to apply the
present foreigners’ registration regula-
tions to all Britons, as well as requiring
entry vouchers for British nationals
coming to India. These measures re-
quire full registration at hotels and
police stations, notification of travel
from one city to another, and pos-
session of foreigners’ papers.
India’s position, it is now generally
conceded, has become crucial. The con-
fidential exchange of telegrams between
London and New Delhi shows how
bitterly Mrs. Indira Gandhi’s Govern-
ment tried to prevent Mr. Callaghan
proceeding with his measure.
The Indian Government described
the proposed Act as showing racial dis-
crimination against people of Asian
origin. India’s requests for postpone-
ment of the Bill to allow for con-
sultations were ignored. The result
has been a widespread demand in
India’s Parliament for withdrawal
from the Commonwealth. Even if this
does not occur, the links with the
Commonwealth will have been greatly
weakened.
However, although Mrs. Gandhi has
expressed her Government’s sympathy
with the people Britain is keeping out,
she has made it clear that India owes
them nothing. It was Britain which
gave Asian settlers the choice. They
opted for Britain of their own free
will and Britain agreed to accept them.
This ended any responsibility India
might have.
The Kenya and India actions have
the same effect: to make it harder foi
Britain to' expel Asians who hold
British passports but who do not qualify
for inclusion in the new annual quota
of 1500 entry vouchers for overseas.
British citizens.
This strikes at the control mechanism
of the new Immigrants Act, which
depends on the ability to enforce the
removal of Asians who enter Britain
illegally. If—as is now envisaged—
Kenya will not have them back, and
if India refuses an alternative place of
abode, Britain will have no way of
enforcing the Act’s control measures.
It is clear, from what passed pri-
vately between London, Nairobi, and
New Delhi last week, that as matters:
now stand there is virtually no hope
of getting the kind of co-operation Mr.
Callaghan needs for his controls to
work. In an interview with the “Sun-
day Nation,” Nairobi, Kenya’s Minis-
ter of Industry and Commerce, Mr.
Kibaki, made it clear yesterday that
his Government is determined not to
change its course.
“Kenya,” he said, “would not allow
people without jobs, yet with a country
or nationality (i.e., British), to stay on
here.” Mr. Kibaki is an influential
and moderate member of President
Kenyatta’s Government. His interview
foreshadows one of the dangers Mr.
Callaghan most fears: the creation of
a large group of people with British
passports who are being compelled to
leave. He told Parliament that if this
were to happen he would have no
alternative but to take them in.
(In neighboring Tanzania the 60,000-
cdd Asians are reported to be calm. It
is thought that most of those who are
likely to leave have already gone, either
to Britain or to India, although more
recently emigration to Canada and
Zambia has noticeably increased.)
What is now likely to happen is that
Kenyan Asians who are British pass-
port-holders will use their right to go
to Britain on holiday. There is no
restriction against this and no visas are
required. At the end of their holiday
they could announce that they do not


wish to leave. The British Government
would be unable to deport them.
Britain could find herself with
thousands of Asians who have arrived
quite legally as visitors. As the new
law stands, these people would be de-
barred from working as they have no
valid work permits. But if British firms
refuse to give them work, it is unlikely
that their Asian colleagues who have
opened businesses would refuse to sup-
port them in any way that they can.
The only way of stopping this particu-
lar loophole is by introducing a visa
system for all British passport-holders
wishing to visit Britain.
The most reliable and latest estimate
of those on British passports, living-
outside Great Britain, who are affected
by the new legislation is: Kenya: about
100,000 Asians, who are citizens of
Great Britain, 87,000 of whom have
British passports; Rest of Africa: about
63,000 Asians; Malaysia: about 100,000
from India and 10,000 natives of Sabah
and Sarawak; Singapore: 30,000
Indians, plus some 22,000 who have
the right of British citizenship; South
Yemen: about 100,000 of the 240,000
inhabitants of Aden might now be en-
titled to British passports. About
1,000,000 people in Penang and
Malacca theoretically have dual nation-
ality, and so do a few West Indians.
In London this week, with the dom-
estic debate over, the British Govern-
ment is estimating the intensity of the
effect which the Act is having in the
Commonwealth. There is even talk of
a Commonwealth Prime Ministers’
conference, but the first problem is
where it might be held.

Making up

Kuala Lumpur
AS A BRITISH delegation arrived in
Kuala Lumpur this week to discuss
pull-out aid, Tunku Abdul Rahman
went to Djakarta and Tun Razak
to Singapore. While both the Prime
Minister’s and the Deputy Prime Minis-
ter’s visits are reminders of an unhappy
past, they are being undertaken with a
view to the uncertain future.
The Tunku’s four-day visit to
Djakarta and Bali, which began on
Monday, is in a sense part of the “end-
ing” of Confrontation as vyell as a step
toward better Indo-Malaysia relations
and understanding. “This is, after all,”
pointed out one Indonesian source,
“the first time in a long while that we
have welcomed a Tunku” a remark
which, apart from anything else, under-
lines the continuing contrast betw-een
Malaysian concepts of royalty and the
strong Republican streak of Indonesian
nationalism. There is, in short, a quiet
symbolism about the Tunku’s visit and
his likely welcome.
Since Confrontation ended, Razak
has been to Djakarta and Indonesian
Foreign Minister Malik to Kuala
Lumpur. While Indonesian delegations
nearly always pay a courtesy call on
the Tunku (the military mission which
arrived really to end the conflict sym-
bolically w’ent all the way to his
Kedah home) when they come to
Malaysia, this is the first time Indo-
nesians have had the post-Confronta-
tion opportunity to offer courtesy by
return. The old era will be finally
buried and a new one will get well
under way when President Suharto
visits Malaysia, expectedly in the near
future.
The Malaysian Minister for Com-
merce and Industry, Doctor Lim Swee
Aun, is accompanying the Tunku, and
economic co-operation will no doubt
be one of the items discussed. So far
attempts to get trade on to a better
organised basis have not been very
successful. Djakarta cannot enforce
the rules it likes to lay down, and the
pre-Confrontaticn trading free for all
via Singapore has been more successful
in getting going.
It is unlikely that there will be any
striking developments in the defence
field. More likely, as the Tunku fold
The Bulletin, “We will perhaps revive
the old (1958) Treaty of Friendship.”
Asked to comment on the possibility of
a defence pact, the Tunku said, “We
are, of course, willing to have defence
pacts with anyone,” though he went on
to add that such a development was
“probably too soon.” This last refers
to Adam Malik’s reported willingness
to suggest such a bilateral defence
pact, itself something of a surprise since
it was assumed (as Suharto mentioned
in an interview last week with a Jap-
anese newspaper) that Indonesia was
more interested in the long-term pros-
pect of ASEAN defence arrangements.
Whether or not the bilateral suggestion
is made during this visit, since it
represents drawbacks as well as advan-
tages from the Malaysian viewpoint, it
is likely there wall not be any sensa-
tional developments.
Meanwhile, the only smudge on the
horizon is the continued presence in
Djakarta of erstwhile Sarawak guerilla
leader Abang Kifli living, according
to reports, in a fairly palatial villa.
A trifle tactlessly, Adam Malik chose a
couple of days before the Tunku’s visit
as the time to assert that Kifli would
not be extradited to Malaysia. An un-
necessary insistence since, in any case,
extradition treaty negotiations, pre-
Confrontation between the two Coun-
tries, broke down over the Indonesian
insistence on and the Malaysian objec-
tion to the extradition of political pris-
oners. However, Kifli has been diplo-
matically shuffled out of the way, as he
reportedly departed at the weekend on
a pilgrimage to Mecca.
Nor are any sensational develop-
ments expected as a result of Tun
Razak’s visit to Singapore. “I hope to
improve relations, to improve the
atmosphere between us,” the Tun told
The Bulletin, noting at the same time
that “this is my first visit to Singapore
since separation.”
Obviously Tun Razak does not
expect a mutual defence agreement to
emerge overnight, especially as there
are still no certain signs that the past
has been buried in more ways than one.
So far Razak and Singapore Defence
Minister Goh Keng Swee have agreed
that the defence of the two countries is
“inseparable” but then the recent
Malaysia-Singapore past contains too
many examples of the previously in-
separable being separated.
The separation agreement postulated
joint defence, but subsequent negotia-
tions broke down on Singapore’s in-
sistence that they would give a defence
agreement if Malaysia would give a
common market, and upon the Malay-
sian conviction that Singapore needed
them more than they needed Singapore.
Likewise, the negotiations over a joint
currency broke down even though the
proposed agreement included a mech-
anism for instant dissolution.
Joint defence would appear likely to
be indissoluble as well as inseparable.
It is still too early to know whether
Britain’s imminent departure has
brought home to both countries what
for too long they have preferred not
to recognise—that, give or take a few
points, they both need each other.
As the talks with two Malaysian
leaders take place this week, spurred
on no doubt by the Vietnamese de-
velopments to the northwards, there is
hope without any guarantee that past
prejudices and policies will be giving
way to present realities and futwo
amity.
Vietnam
How many refugees?
IF THE Vietnam War had gone
according to expectations in Washing-
ton and Saigon, some 340,000 South
Vietnamese would have been made
hom.eless in 1968. Now there are
already almost twice that number of
new refugees on top of the 800,000
remaining from previous years.
Almost all the new refugees have
fled from the fighting and destruction
in the towns that followed the Viet
Cong’s Tet offensive. The villages, apart
from a few on the approaches to
towns, seem largely to have escaped.
About 220,000 of the refugees are in
Saigon and its suburban areas in Gia
Dinh province. The remaining 440,000
are scattered throughout the country.
These figures are based on head-
counting in the temporary refugee
camps. They do not take into account
people who have found shelter with


The aftermath of a Communist rocket attack on Saigon’s outskirts
friends or relations, nor do they dis-
tinguish between people whose houses
have been destroyed and those who
have temporarily moved out for safety.
According to preliminary reports,
45,000 houses have been destroyed in
the provincial towns. Assuming an
average of six people per family, some
300,000 people outside Saigon would
be really homeless. The same sort of
calculation for the Saigon area gives
a figure of some 120,000. But, given
the difficulty of collecting any accurate
statistics, all these figures could easily
be too low.
Inevitably most £>f the refugee camps
are overcrowded. Many families have
had to build what shelter they can with
groundsheets, pieces of wood, and any-
thing else at hand. Luckily this is still
the dry season in the southern part
of the country. Sanitary arrangements
are almost non-existent. In one school
there are only three earth closets and
one tap for over 3000 people. It is
a small miracle that no epidemics have
yet been reported. An attempt is being
made to vaccinate against cholera and
plague, even though a good many Viet-
namese still don’t like, and will not
have, injections. Supplies of other
medicines are erratic.
The refugees do seem to have been
getting food, but not much. Spot checks
in the Saigon area showed that refu-
gees are getting each day somewhere
in the region of 350 grammes of rice. A
healthy Vietnamese adult normally
expects to eat more than a kilo of rice
—lOOO grammes —a day. Families have
also been getting a tin of sardines or
meat every two or three days and some
condensed milk for the children. The
situation in some of the provinces is
bound to be much worse.
The Government has avoided disas-
ter by its handling of the refugee prob-
lem up to now. It is the months ahead
that will provide the real test. First
the refugees must be moved from the
present makeshift camps.
In the Saigon area, the Ministry of
Social Welfare and Refugees plans to
set up four temporary refugee com-
munities housed in tents and prefabri-
cated homes. The Vietnamese Air
Force has already started work, on the
first of these. The Ministry also in-
tends to build flats for 36,000 people
within a year. These will be sold on
instalments for $2500 each. However
generous the compensation payments,
this would seem to be beyond the
means of all but middle-class refugees.
Refugees in the provincial towns and
in the outlying precincts of Saigon are
to get the same treatment as peasant
refugees. This means bags of cement for
flooring and ten double sheets of roof-
ing plus a cash grant of about $4O.
Although there is talk of doubling the
cash grant in the Saigon area it re-
mains to be seen how people who lost
fairly decent little houses will react
to this offer. Only real slum-dwellers
stand to equal or improve their pre-
vious living conditions. The Vietnamese
Government has made a point of keep-
ing all refugee operations and plans
under its firm control. Foreign volun-
tary agencies, for example, have not
been allowed to make direct contact
with Vietnamese religious and social
groups involved in relief work. In
other words, the . Government stands
to take all the credit or ail the blame
for the way things turn out. There is
obvious risk in this, particularly since
many refugees are disposed to blame
the bombing by American and South
Vietnamese planes as much as the
original Viet Cong attack for their
present plight.
Thailand
The Domino game
THE IMMEDIATE reaction of Thai-
land’s Deputy Premier Prapas Charu-
sathiara to the recent Viet Cong Tet
offensive was a furious onslaught, to
the effect that the free world is always
being put at a disadvantage by either
the United Nations or the Communists.
“The Communists are able to do any-
thing without consideration for any
Geneva agreement,” he said. “They
only want to have a victory. The
United Nations cannot do anything
against the Communists. On the con-
trary, the free world must also limit
its actions to agreements. On a simple
Communist allegation against the free
world the UN immediately sets up a
committee to investigate.”
Prapas’ ire was understandable.
Hard-headed realists as they are, the
Thai leaders see the Vietnam War as
essentially a power struggle to be
viewed dispassionately and waged
ruthlessly. They would feel that “wars
of national liberation” are best not
fought on the free w'orld’s television
screens since the TV footage and
foreign correspondents’ necessarily one-
sided reporting in effect help the
Communists, if only because the latter
don’t have free reporters or camera-
men. Foreign Minister Thanat Kho-
man’s attacks last year on the Ameri-
can and foreign Press, together with his
more recent reiteration that the Viet
Cong offensive failed because of the
VC’s atrocities, have all to be seen
partly in this light.
Thai irritation and anxiety have
also to be seen against the fact that
the present regime has abandoned the
substance of neutrality in the calcula-
tion that a line was going to be drawn
and Thailand would be on the United
States’ side of that line. Recent Viet-
nam developments have not weakened
the commitment but almost certainly
have caused some Thai leaders to cal-
culate that they have left themselves
no room for self-preservation as a
ruling elite if, in the words of one
astute Thai diplomat, “we have to make
the Domino theory work.” American
reassurances that they will not quit
Thailand and Vietnam in this sense
obviate some of the worry.
For the Thai realists looking out on
the world from Bangkok, a South
Korean solution in South Vietnam is
the wish that has been father to th r
growing commitment. Vietnam is *
traditional enemy best divided. A
united Communist Vietnam would De
even better able to put the insurgency
heat on Thailand. Support from the
Thais for the American stand has in-
evitably led to America asking for
more support. Commitment has con-
sequently escalated. A further 10,000
Thai troops will soon be joining the
Queen’s Cobra Regiment, already in
Vietnam.
Observers of the Thailand scene point
cut that in some ways this development
goes contrary to the traditional pattern
which they see epitomised by the six-
hour war against Japan, followed by a
period when the Thai right hand co-
operated wdth Tokyo, the left hand with
the Allies. Since recent developments
prompt the question: “If Vietnam
goes . . .” it is considered that in such
an eventuality, while the Thais will
adjust, it is unlikely as before that the
same people will do the adjusting.
Hence perhaps Bangkok’s refusal to see
in public at least as other South-
East Asians are tending to see, a politi-


cal defeat for America in the making.
Once again the Thai realism. For Bang-
kok more pressure is required, not less.
The “Hanoi war machine” can and
should be “brought to its knees.” Not
sharing the common Asian inferiority
complex vis-a-vis the West because they
remained uncolonised, the Thais would
possibly have fewer objections to the
use of tactical nuclear weapons. Cer-
tainly Bangkok considers as yet that the
logic of America’s power and commit-
ment —if not her idealism —will “see
it through” without retreating. In this
regard Thanat Khoman’s recent call for
more regional defence arrangements on
the grounds that American blood and
treasure will not flow endlessly into
South-East Asia is one more realistic
sign, though the Thais certainly realise
such arrangements are still a long way
off.
In short, today Thailand is a slightly
certain Domino while remaining no-
body’s certain Domino at one and the
same time. Where Bangkok’s realism
breaks down and where its optimism on
the Vietnam outcome appears naive is
in relation to the continuing wide gap
between the South Vietnamese Gov-
ernment and the Vietnamese people.
But then this is understandable. The
self - same gap between governors and
governed is also Thailand’s greatest
weakness.
U.S. race riots
Newark relived
THE REPORT of President Johnson’s
commission which investigated last
summer’s “civil disorders” turns out
to be far more of an indictment of
official brutality than an expose of
Negro violence. The 1485-page docu-
ment, released in Washington at the
weekend, comes at a time when the
popular political demand is all for
stronger and tougher measures by the
nation’s law-enforcement agencies.
Its most devastating parts —also the
most embarrassing for the White House
in an election year—are contained in
a chapter called “Profiles in Disorder.”
In this section of its findings, only
thinly touched on in the summary of
its conclusions released earlier in the
week, the 11-man commission investi-
gates in detail what really happened
in ten of last summer’s 50-odd urban
disturbances.
The authentic flavor of what it dis-
covered comes through perhaps most
clearly in its discussion of Newark, that
staging post of the poor rising from the
salt marches of New Jersey, almost
within sight of all the wealth of Wall
Street. The commission’s most
damaging criticisms are not direct.
They are concealed instead in its
An inquiry commission has criticised the use of machine-guns and tanks to control
Negro rioters. Last week in Maryland, Army volunteers tested a new method—foam
account of what actually took place
during the three days of the riot there.
It tells the story largely by random
snapshots.
Here is the account of one incident:
“At 5.30 p.m. on Friday, July 14, W.F.
told J.S., whose car he had taken to
the garage for inspection, that his
front brake needed fixing. J.S., who
had just returned from work, went to
the car, which was parked in the street,
jacked up the front end, took the wheel
off, and got under the car. The street
was quiet. More than a dozen persons
were sitting in porches, walking about,
or shopping. None heard any shots.”
“Suddenly several State Troopers
appeared at the corner. J.S. was
startled by a shot clanging into a dust-
bin next to his car. He looked up
and saw a State Trooper with a rifle
pointed at him. The next shot struck
him in the right side. At almost the
same instant, K.G., standing on a
porch, was struck in the right eye by a
bullet. Both he and J.S. were critically
injured.”
Another incident is recorded as:
“At six o’clock on Saturday, July 15,
two columns of National Guardsmen
and State Troopers were directing mass
fire at a housing project in response to
what they believed were snipers. On
the tenth floor, Eloise Spellman, the
mother of several children, fell a
bullet through her neck.
“Across the street a number of per-
sons, standing in a window in a block
of fiats, were watching the firing
directed at the housing project. Sud-
denly several troops whirled round and
began firing in the general direction of
the spectators. Mrs. Hattie Gainer, a
grandmother, sank to the floor. A block
away Rebecca Brown’s two-year-old
daughter was standing at the window.
Mrs. Brown rushed to drag her to
safety. As Mrs. Brown was momen-
tarily framed in the window, a bullet
spun into her back. All three women
died.”
Here is a third incident: “On the
evening of Monday, July 17, after the
National Guard and State police had
been withdrawn, a Roman Catholic
priest saw two Negroes walking down
the .street. They were carrying a case
of soda water and two bags of groceries.
An unmarked car with five police
officers inside it pulled up alongside
them. Two white officers got out of
the car. Accusing the Negro men of
looting, the officers made them put
their groceries on the pavement, then
kicked the bags open, scattering the
contents all over the street, telling the
-men: ‘Get out of here.’ The officers
sped off.
“The Catholic priest went across the
street to help gather up the groceries.
One of the men turned to him. ‘l’ve
just been back from Vietnam two
days,’ he said. ‘I feel like going home,,
getting a rifle, and shooting the cops’.”
Were there in fact ever any Negro
guerilla snipers in Newark? The Com-
mission is careful not to pronounce
judgment. It does, however, quote the
city’s chief of police (an Italian) as
saying that when all was safely over:
“As a matter of fact, down in the main
riot area it was so bad that in my
opinion guardsmen were firing at police
and police were firing back at them. I
really don’t believe there was as much
sniping as we thought.”
If an extreme case, Newark is also—
as the Commission candidly recognises—
a symptom of America’s whole urban
problem. In the past 20 years its white
citizens have deserted it in droves for the
suburbs. Its non-white population per-
centage has risen from 35 percent to 62
percent in the past six years alone. But
the white community has shown no sign
of relinquishing its hold on the city’s
political control.
The Commission also complained
about some police departments stock-
piling weapons which they should not
use in riot control, such as machine-
guns and tanks, while paying scant heed
to non-lethal weapons, such as night-
sticks and tear-gas.
“We should not attempt to convert
our police into combat troops equipped
for urban warfare. Great harm is likely
to result from the use of military
weapons of mass destruction by police
forces which lack the command and
control of firearms discipline of military
units.” There was no conceivable justifi-
cation, the report said, for providing
machine-guns, flame-throwers, or artil-
lery to National Guard units assigned to
riot-control operations in densely popu-
lated urban areas.

The great John Gorton mystery
WHEN JOHN GORTON became the
19th Prime Minister of Australia The
Bulletin ran a cover story wondering
whether he would prove to be John
the Bold or Gorton the Unready—the
quick, impulsive man of action, or the
man who found it hard to make up his
mind. Or whether, ideally, he might
combine both qualities, thinking hard,
then deciding hard.
His actions in the seven weeks
between becoming Prime Minister and
announcing his new Cabinet still left
both questions open. John the Bold
committed himself to no more troops
in Vietnam, but in the Sydney Town
Hall Gorton the Unready gave a pre-
pared statement qualifying what he had
said earlier. John the Bold bluntly said
that Australia could not fill the gap
left by the British departure from
Malaysia-Singapore, but presumably
Gorton the Unready had had a word
with his External Affairs Minister
before the latter went off to Malaysia
and Singapore and made statements
that qualified his Prime Minister’s
statement. John the Bold spoke of “re-
thinking,” “upheavals,” and “ruling off
the book”; Gorton the Unready said
“. . . let’s amend that and say
‘changes’” (January 9), “I wouldn’t
say great changes, no” (January 21).
Most of the questions raised in the
seven weeks after his appointment as
Prime Minister remained open last
week when Mr. Gorton appointed his
Cabinet and got down to the detailed
job of being Prime Minister. He no
longer seemed a man in a hurry, but
the seven-week gap had caused so much
speculation (almost all of it favorable
to him) that there was some reaction
against him when the changes he
announced proved to be minor. He
had wisely broken the traditional idea
of forming a Cabinet with an eye on
fair representation from each State and
the Senate; South Australia and Tas-
mania were unrepresented and there
was only one Cabinet Minister from
the Senate. But otherwise his ministerial
changes were no greater than those in
Mr. Holt’s first ministry—except that
Mr. Holt had been quicker about mak-
ing them and had also announced new
policy decisions for good measure. Yet
the seven weeks that had passed were,
as those who were quick at political
arithmetic knew, something like seven
percent of the time that lay between
Mr. Gorton’s appointment and the next
Federal elections.
The general impression of Mr.
Gorton among Australians still remains
highly favorable. The voting in the
N.S.W. elections seemed to suggest that
his image made a reliable Federal
backdrop to that of a State Liberal
Party and, perhaps even more tellingly,
Federal Opposition Leader Whitlam
and his close associates have not yet
worked out how they are going to
handle Mr. Gorton. On television, Mr.
Whitlam has the disadvantage of seem-
ing “hot” when Mr. Gorton seems
“cool”; gone is the advantage that Mr.
Whitlam was beginning to build up as
a TV entertainer when Mr. Holt was
Prime Minister. And it is expected that
in Parliament Mr. Gorton will make a
cooler, quicker, and more ruthless
opponent of Mr. Whitlam than Mr.
Holt did.
Overall, his unpretentious style has
been appealing; where it offends,
it offends mainly old-style Menzies
Liberals, who have to vote for Mr.
Gorton anyway. Even his carelessness
in dress, distinguished both from the
careful old-fashionedness of Sir
Robert’s clothes and the Collins Street
dapperness and Portsea casualness of
Mr. Holt’s, has gone down well and
his unaffected easiness in style as
Prime Minister, when more anecdotes
have got into the newspapers about it,
will make him the most credible
embodiment in a Prime Minister of an
Australian myth since Ben Chifley.
Instead of using his desk buzzer, he is
likely to hop over to the door of his
office to find something out from one
of his staff; when he wants to know
some particular thing about what’s
happening to the country he is as likely
to make a direct telephone call to the
particular public servant who knows
the answer as to make inquiries through
the usual channels.
But habits such as these themselves
raise one of the main questions they
are asking in Canberra: is John Gorton
informal, or is he sloppy? Does he
have that genius for getting things done
that can cut through traditional
methods? Or is it just that he’s in a bit
of a muddle? As things stand, the
answers could be decisive for Australia.
The Cabinet that Mr. Gorton
announced last week (and the adminis-
trative changes he didn’t announce)
meant little more than business a bit
better than usual. This means that,
unless he makes some more dramatic
changes later, most of it now depends
on Mr. Gorton. Can he take hold of
much the same collection of Ministers
and much the same arrangements in
Government departments and make
them all work better than they used
to? Or will things still have that
tendency to flounder that they showed
so unhappily in the latter stages of the
Holt Government?
' Take one of the tests of Mr. Gorton’s
effectiveness that they are now discus-
sing in Canberra. Unlike Mr. Holt,
who liked to get into his office early
and be busy all day, Mr. Gorton pre-
fers to arrive in the mid-morning and
skip most of the detail. (His reading
of overseas cables, which Mr. Holt used
to get through indefatigably, is said to
The favored candidate’s win was soon
formalised in the swearing-in
GORTON: THE FIRST 80 DAYS
The switch to the House of Representatives required the further ritual of
nominating as a candidate in the Higgins by-election


be close to nil.) This laconicism can
be an effective way of running a gov-
ernment if it is associated, with good
staff work (somebody has to be looking
at the detail) and the drive of decision.
■“Delegation” was, for a while, a new
fashion in theories of organisation in
the United States, but it is now out of
favor because it was found that execu-
tives who cut themselves off from detail
tended to cut themselves off from the
possibility of decision. A creative
executive is sometimes one who puts
details together in a way no one else
had thought of, thereby reaching new
decisions: this was the style of Presi-
dent Kennedy and President Johnson,
compared with that of President Eisen-
hower.
But either style depends on a strong
staff. It is known that Mr. Gorton
would like to set up a “think tank” in
the Prime Minister’s Department, and
perhaps if he does so his laconic style
may function very well. But in the
meantime his first attempts to do so,
including some disastrous hint-dropping,
have produced such consternation in
the Prime Minister’s Department, and
especially in its Secretary, that it is
difficult to imagine that for the moment
anybody in the tank is doing much
thinking. As a result of talking before
he acted, a large part of the senior
civil service is now critical of Mr.
Gorton, and wary. They have not
hesitated to turn to Ministers for pro-
tection and some of their Ministers will
not hesitate to stick up for them with
Mr. Gorton. It would have been better
if Mr. Gorton had carried his ideas into
effect, rather than talking about them
and allowing effective opposition to
bank up. It was Sir Robert Menzies
who set up an administrative style of
predictability and order in the civil
service, welcome to them after the im-
provisations of the Labor Government.
This style now sometimes becomes
stodgy and cautious, particularly at the
top. But merely to affront the bureau-
cracy without changing it will not
achieve anything; it may merely hold
things up. If Mr. Gorton really wants
to galvanise the administration he will
have to use guile and thoroughness,
making a long hard job of it in which
he seeks co-operation wherever he can
get it.
Many of these initial puzzles about
what is the true shape of the new Prime
Minister come from the fact that, as a
Minister in the Menzies and Holt Gov-
ernments, he had not been right at the
intractable centre of power. He may not
at once have realised how tough it can
be if you want to change things. He
may even have over-estimated his own
power as Prime Minister. In his first
honeymoon period as Prime Minister he
indicated in a television interview that
he felt that a Prime Minister should
have the final say in Cabinet. Now he
has found out that as a Prime Minister
he did not even have the final say in
the making of his own Cabinet. It has
never before happened in the Liberal
Party that a Prime Minister in making
a Cabinet has been so influenced by
the reactions of Cabinet Ministers and
even backbenchers. This was Mr.
Gorton’s own doing. In not announcing
his new Cabinet in the normal manner
several days after taking office, he
allowed it to become a matter for
Cabinet and Party pressure.
There is another factor, one that he
must now be taking into account, and
that is that for the moment he has no
magic to his colleagues as Prime
Minister. Until he acquires that magic
he is simply the man to whom they gave
the job because they wanted a change
from the Menzies line of succession.
His Deputy Prime Minister, Country
Party Leader John McEwen, and some
of his Cabinet preferred Mr. Hasluck,
his principal opponent for the Prime
Ministership, and other Ministers still
see Mr. Gorton as one of themselves.
The Bulletin has already argued that
Mr. Gorton made a mistake when, after
the telephoned request from Singapore’s
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to fly
with him to London, Mr. Gorton con-
sulted his Cabinet and then refused. By
flying to London he could have begun
that process of setting himself apart
from his colleagues in which lies part
of a Prime Minister’s power. He has yet
to establish that kind of magic. It can
be established in all kinds of ways, but
unless it is established a Prime Minister
remains merely first amongst equals. If
Mr. Gorton proves a vote-winner in the
1969 elections he will have it—but there
are still something more than 90 weeks
until he has a chance to win the next
election.
Of course, some of the questions they
are now asking about Mr. Gorton in
Canberra may be based on a false
expectation of the relation between his
private face and what he would like
his public face as Prime Minister to be.
Privately, Mr. Gorton is inclined to
impatience and to forcefulness of
language. This aroused the anticipation
that he would be a Prime Minister in
a forceful hurry and he has been
judged in this way. This may not, how-
ever, be Mr. Gorton’s own concept of
his job. It is not unusual for a political
leader to follow public styles that are
different from his private inclinations.
(One cannot help wishing, however,
that Mr. Gorton would at least begin
making public his private capacity for
wit, which is more considerable than
has been usual in Australian Prime
Ministers.)
If Mr. Gorton has been doing some
As Party Leader it was important to show the Federal
flag on behalf of Premier Robin Askin in the New South
Wales election
The image of a new casualness was quickly established


serious thinking in all that time he
hasn’t spent at his desk reading cables,
how much of it has been concerned
with running the country in a new way
and how much of it with winning the
next election in a new way? A silly
question to ask of any political leader
and one to which he could not neces-
sarily give a correct answer himself—
but there is some suggestion that Mr.
Gorton’s emphasis on “development”
and his off-the-cuff attempts to cool
down foreign policy as an issue have
not been entirely unconnected with
political calculation. He is to have
been impressed with the suggestion in
recent Gallup Poll figures that for the
first time in many years more people
think their economic position is getting
worse rather than better. He is also said
to be impressed by the kind of surveys
that suggest that electors consider
education and social services to be the
most important political issues. It is
believed to be for these reasons that
his first positive announcement was a
proposal for Commonwealth aid to
cover people suffering from chronic
illness, a proposal that was worked out
last May by the Department of Health
and its Minister and had been waiting
around since then for somebody to pick
it up. There has also been speculation
that he appointed the able Mr. Fraser
to the Department of Education and
the able Mr. Wentworth to the Depart-
ment of Social Services for the same
reason, although it has been noted that
his earlier thought about lumping the
Departments of Health, Social Services,
and Repatriation into one big Ministry
of National Welfare has not yet come
to anything. Is Bill Wentworth going
to be allowed to produce a scheme for
relaxing the means test as next year’s
election-winner? was the question asked
as soon as Mr. Wentworth’s appoint-
ment as Minister for Social Services
was announced.
For the sake of the Liberal Party it
is to be hoped that Mr. Gorton does
not base his politics-making on survey
results, unless he is sophisticated in
their analysis. It is now a platitude of
psephology that the issues that electors
consider to be “most important” in sur-
veys are not usually those that decide
elections. If they were, parties would
put up promises on these issues as if
they were running a clearance sale and
voters would take their shopping lists
with them to the polls, voting for the
party that credibly promised the most.
The general stance of parties, and the
general “images” that voters have of
them as possible governments seem to
be more decisive questions. It is some-
times the unacceptable in a party that
determines attitudes to it rather than
its promises.
, This is not to say, of course, that
there is anything wrong with Mr. Gor-
ton taking a special interest in social
services. Good luck to him and to
Australia, too. Although one of the
early countries to set up welfare
schemes, Australia has been lagging for
some time behind a number of other
countries in adjusting its approaches to
the conditions of increasing affluence—
which means both that the distressed
miss out on the attention they deserve
and that the better-off also miss out on
more sophisticated schemes such as the
kind of universal retirement plan they
have in Sweden. There is no doubt
that Mr. Wentworth will soon be com-
ing up with some new ideas—and not
only in social services but also in
Aboriginal affairs, his other responsi-
bility, and Australia’s greatest single
problem in social welfare.
So far as the Education portfolio is
concerned, there is evidence that Mr.
Gorton sees—as his predecessors did not
—that education may be the keystone
to “national development.” In his
speech last week to the Liberal
Speakers’ Group in Melbourne he
seemed to be connecting the indus-
trialisation of Australia and the drive
to export more manufactured goods
with education, research, and science.
Is it possible that he will use Common-
wealth funds to force Australia to break
away from its British traditions of ter-
tiary education (which are now serving
Britain so badly) and approach closer
to the American, German, Japanese,
and French patterns (which are now
serving those countries so well)? He
certainly seemed to be seeing “develop-
ment” as something more than building
irrigation works when he said earlier
that the cities (in which most Aus-
tralians live and which produce most
of our wealth) should be part of our
development plans.
Mr. Holt did not seem to develop
any new domestic policies. It is clear
that Mr. Gorton wants to avoid this
fault. But an emphasis on domestic
policy to the detriment of external
policy has two dangers—one for the
Liberal Party and one for Australia.
Since the Labor Party split of 1954,
it has been the domestic political func-
tion of foreign policy in Australia to
keep the Labor Party divided. This has
acted both as a telling form of “pro-
duct differentiation” and as a direct
issue in elections. As a direct issue it
has given the DLP its organisational
and propaganda strength, and it has
also made a direct appeal to a number
of other voters. More indirectly, it has
caused a significant difference between
the Liberal-Country Parties and the
Labor Party: because the Labor Party
continued to be divided in its attitude
toward the Government’s foreign policy
it appeared, even to electors not greatly
seized with an interest in foreign policy,
to be a divided, quarrelsome party and,
therefore, not a credible alternative
Government. If Mr. Gorton extends
the present kind of stance he has on
foreign affairs, the parliamentary Labor
Party, already more cohesive under Mr.
Whitlam than was imaginable under
its two predecessors, may appear to be
more credible as an alternative Govern-
ment. If this were so, and if the prin-
cipal things discussed at the election
were domestic matters, the Labor Party
could put up a bold front: it could
talk bigger than Mr. Gorton. There is
also, for the Liberals, the greatest night-
mare of all—a shift in emphasis in the
DLP. This is not yet likely, but a drift
in the Government’s foreign policy
could unsettle the DLP—particularly
in its political wing—in a way that
could give the Government a nasty
shock.
This is not just a matter of Vietnam
and Communism. The DLP has be-
come the political party that is most
interested in seeing Australia redefine
itself as an independent nation by play-
ing a role in South-East Asia commen-
surate with its comparatively great
economic strength. The idea of a retreat
from that responsibility could cause
shudders of unpredictable direction and
vigor.
This brings up the greatest of all
puzzles about John Gorton. What is
his concept of Australia’s role in South-
East Asia? Initially there was surprise
that he spoke so guardedly atjout Viet-
nam and Malaysia-Singapore. His
earlier history was Right-Wing a
member of “the Formosa Lobby” in
the 19505, an advocate in 1957 of Aus-
tralian nuclear weapons, he was ex-
pected to come out with something
pretty hot and strong about South-East
Asia, but when he spoke he seemed to
be to the Left of Sir Robert Menzies
and Mr. Holt.
This is not really so. Unlike Mr.
Holt, he may share some of Sir Robert’s
emotional indifference to South-East
Asia. But at least at the time when he
became Prime Minister he was inclined
to share the view of one of his closest
parliamentary friends that in a few
years South-East Asia would be “fin-
ished.” Whatever the settlement in Viet-
nam it would inevitably cause the rest
of the dominoes to collapse, so goodbye
South-East Asia: it was Australia’s re-
sponsibility to humanity to “develop”
itself. Enormous political resistances are
likely to drag Mr. Gorton away from
this naivete the opposition of most
of his senior Ministers, the sheer force
of what is now the tradition of Austra-
lian foreign policy, sharp talk from the
Americans, Labor Party manoeuvres,
DLP pressures, promptings from the
Japanese. Just as important, when he
starts reading more fully the cables that
are put on his desk, and when he
makes his Asian tour this year, he may
himself get a different and more com-
plex feel for the subject that will
change his attitudes. In the meantime,
events press on. The meeting of the-
Prime Ministers of Malaysia, Singa-
pore, ■ New Zealand, Britain, and Aus-
tralia will come up; a new overall
defence plan has to be announced by
the middle of the year.
By the end of the year Mr. Gorton
will probably be doing better in his
speech-making than when he said last
week that he foresaw an Australia “with
the material strength of the United
States and the spiritual strength of
Europe.” If that’s the way he sees
Europe and America he should use
some of his spare time re-reading the
history of the 20th century.

Who runs the
Viet Cong?
By MARK FRANKLAND, in Saigon
OBSERVERS in Sai-
gon are now con-
vinced that some
time in the next few
months Hanoi and
the National Libera-
tion Front will crown
their military offen-
sive with a dramatic
new offer to negotiate
an end to the war.
Although the North
Vietnamese may well
take the first diplo-
matic step, the sort
of settlement they
demand ultimately
depends on the Front.
It has, therefore,
never been more im-
portant to under-
stand just who and
how strong the NLF
is, and what it really
wants for Vietnam.
Up till now the pro-
paganda of both sides
has made this very
difficult.
Hanoi declares the
Front to be a coali-
tion of patriotic
South Vietnamese
Parties, which just
happens to include
as its ‘ vanguard” the
People’s Revolution-
ary Party, the Com-
munist Party of
South Vietnam.
According to this ver-
sion the Front’s
leader, far from be-
ing a Red bogyman,
is a one-time Saigon
lawyer with a liking
for good clothes,
called Nguyen Huu
Tho.
The handouts from
Saigon and Washing-
ton seem to be talking about another
organisation altogether. The Front, they
say, is simply a “tool” of Hanoi, rigidly
controlled by Communists and bossed
ultimately by Ho Chi Minh himself.
The popular nickname for the Front
and its soldiers—“ Viet Cong”—means
simply “Vietnamese Communists” and
is entirely accurate.
The truth, as usual, is far more
Th a. n • J-
complicated. The Viet Cong is direc-
5.™ 'Tgamsation called the
Vential Office for South Vietnam
The most recent picture of Ho Chi Minh, 78, addressing a Hanoi rally
(COSVN). This operates from a
heavily defended mobile base some-
where in Cambodia.
Most South Vietnamese have never
heard of its chief, who goes under
various aliases, including Muoi Cue and
Nguyen Van Muoi. He was born in
1913 in North Vietnam, but came to
Saigon when still a boy.
He has led the classically shady
career of a revolutionary. It is known
that he worked in the French naval
yards in Saigon, and then was impri-
soned by the French in the late 1930 s
on the island of Con
Son. He used the
prison years to edu-
cate himself, and
escaped at the end
of World War 11.
Many years later a
sketchy cobweb of
interrogation reports
and captured docu-
ments showed that
this mystery man
held a unique assort-
ment of offices typi-
fying the subtle and
complex organisation
of which the Viet
Cong is the public
face.
Within COSVN it-
self, Muoi Cue is
Secretary of the Cur-
rent Affairs Com-
mittee, the directing
political brain of
the dozen sections
into which the office
is divided. By virtue
of this position, it is
certain that he is also
one of the Chiefs, if
not the Chief, of
South Vie t n a m’s
Communist Party.
But he is also a
member of the Cen-
tral Committee of
the North Vietnamese
Communist Party
and since last year
has very likely also
sat in its politburo.
In fact, all the
senior members of
COSVN are prob-
ably members of both
North and South
Vietnamese Central
Committees. Not sur-
prisingly, many Wes-
tern Hanoiologists
maintain that the Southern Party,
created only in 1962, is an organisa-
tional ruse to disguise what to all in-
tents and purposes is a united Viet-
namese Communist Party led from
Hanoi.
Where, one may well ask, does the
dapper Mr. Nguyen Huu Tho fit into
this formidably interlocking organisa-
tion? No one knows for certain if he
is even a member of the Southern Party,
let alone of its Central Committee.
As far as COSVN’s organisational
chart goes, he is just a member, not

even at the head of the COSVN section
that deals with Front affairs. Tho’s
picture may still get displayed in Peking
along with Ho Chi Minh’s, but it seems
that back in COSVN’s jungle head-
quarters he is small beer beside veteran
revolutionaries like Muoi Cue.
However, this doesn’t mean that the
Saigon-Washington view of the Viet
Cong is completely accurate. It is cer-
tainly true that it is now Communists
who drive and fire the Viet Cong.
The Vietnamese nationalist revolu-
tionary movement, that began with the
Vietminh, has undergone a process of
crystallisation over the past 22 years.
The softer elements have disappeared,
the communist core remains, its surface
tougher and its edges sharper than
before.
You do not have to look far in Saigon
today to see proof of this. Take one
land-owning southern family that in the
•old days was anti-French right down
to the little children who distributed
Vietminh leaflets. Four of its teenage
children went into the Maquis. One son
was killed, another came back to Saigon
after the Geneva settlement of 1954
ended the war against the French, un-
able to accept the growing power of
the Communists, also, perhaps under-
standably, anxious for an easier life.
Two sisters also joined the Maquis after
being expelled from the Lycee Marie
Curie, the grandest French girls’ school
in Saigon, for their political activities.
Unlike their brother, they went north
after Geneva. Perhaps they have been
sent back to fight in the south. No one
knows.
Today, their family partly admires,
partly fears them for their toughness.
They speak of them as almost a dif-
ferent sort of people the illusion
of nationalist solidarity possible under
the Vietminh has been shattered for
good.
But although COSVN is undeniably
communist, it is also still a consciously
southern organisation. Vietnamese
Communists seem well aware that re-
gional feelings have to be handled care-
fully. Although North Vietnamese
soldiers now make up 50 percent or
more of many Viet Cong fighting units,
command at all levels is usually kept
by southerners. The all-important
political commissars, who are both
communist chaplins for the troops and
demagogues of revolution for the
people, are always native South Viet-
namese.
The same care is taken in Hanoi’s
relations with COSVN. The North
Vietnamese politburo does not send
directions to Muoi Cue and his men, it
sends “proposals.” The details of the
southern part of the yearly program
laid down by Hanoi’s Central Com-
mittee for North and South Vietnam
are left to COSVN’s discretion.
However, for all their awareness of
the political importance of southern
sensibilities, both Viet Cong and North

Vietnamese undercut American in-
dignation over northern “aggression”
and “domination” by their simple
thesis that Vietnam is one country.

in fact North Vietnamese troops in
regular North Vietnamese units. To
Washington and Saigon they are in-

vaders. Hanoi simply keeps quiet about
them, but Viet Cong officers will say,
“Why not? They are Vietnamese, too.”
But there is more to the Viet Cong
than a nationalist movement captured
over the years by Communists. When
the National Liberation Front was
created in 1960, it promised other things
besides national revolution at a distant
date. While preparing for that revolu-
tion it brought to a backward peasantry
the techniques of modern social and
economic organisation and life.
The Front also gave them land, or
reduced their rents. The poor peasants,
and most of them were poor, thanked
the Front for this and feared the
Government in Saigon because one day
it might reinstate the old landlords.
Some of the young people liked the
Front’s willingness to abandon tiresome
old customs like the complicated mar-
riage ceremonies. There was terror, too,
but at first it was against the very rich
who fought against the Front’s influ-
ence, or against often unpopular
Government officials.
Certainly when the guerillas first
appeared in the villages in the summer
of 1960 they were in no position to
establish themselves by brute force.
Many of them were armed with only
mock rifles made of wood.
The source of the Front’s power, then
as now, were the political commissars.
Even at the start they were probably
all Communists. Although they manipu-
lated the people, they also, by a com-
mon process of Communist double-
think, firmly believed that they were
the people’s servants.
They were supposed to teach by
example as well as word. On the whole
they lived and even their enemies
testify to this as poorly as the peas-
ants. As the war grew fiercer, their life
became harder. Often they carried all
their possessions on their backs: a ham-
mock, a plastic cover against the rain,
an ingenious little oil lamp with a rifle
cartridge as wickholder, a few medi-
cines, and, always, Front literature.
Americans claim that last year the
Front’s control was cut to some 16 per-
cent of the people. But even though
the Front has had to tax its peasants
more and more heavily, to press harder
and harder for recruits, and to use more
Terror to keep its grip, the Front cadre
(leader) keeps his mystique even among
many peasants who neither understand
nor share his ideal. One said recently:
“Viet Cong cadres come as pupils of
the peasants. The Government cadres
come as their masters.”
The commissars, are also the secret
weapon of the Liberation Army, follow-
ing straight in the tradition of the
Russian commissars who held together
and inspired the peasant Red Army in
its early days.
The whole Viet Cong machinery,
which totals between 300,000 and
400,000 men and women, including
regular troops, guerillas, part-time
militia, and political and administra-
tive personnel, is fuelled basically by
a ceaseless stream of words from the
commissars. Guerillas may be absent
irom their unit for four or five months
while they trudge for weeks to and
from a reindoctrination course at some
distant headquarters.
A good commissar will not only ex-
plain away embarrassing facts like the
prosperity of parts of Saigon-controlled
Vietnam “They are the slaves of
material things” but will also get
the puzzled soldiers to agree with him.
Even the songs the soldiers sing
under the commissars’ direction, the
only form of entertainment many
guerillas ever get, make their careful
political point. The Viet Cong could
probably never have done what it has
unless it reflected something, too, of
the Vietnamese character. It is not just
that the Vietnamese like clandestine
political organisations or have for
centuries excelled at guerilla warfare,
though both are true.
Looking at the Vietnamese one
wonders where the Western stereotype
of the cold, impassive oriental ever
came from. In fact, they are highly
emotional and very intense. They are
the stuff of which zealots are made.
What, then, can be expected from
the Front if the present fighting turns
to proposals for negotiations? The
answer is already there for all to read
in the Front’s new program. It can
be summed up as flexibility and com-
promise in the short term, but
absolute toughness in the long term.
Eventually Vietnam must be unified.
It will also be “socialist,” though that
is not stated in so many words. But the
value of the Front for the Vietnamese
Communists is that by allowing for an
interim period of possibly some years
it will soften the shock both for foreign
opinion and for the many South Viet-
namese who may want the war to stop
but who are not pro-Communist by
any conceivable reading. A new Gov-
ernment would be elected in which the
Front would be represented and which
the Communists, probably without too
much difficulty, would try to manipu-
late from carefully selected “guiding
height.”
A well-known friend of Hanoi in
neighboring Cambodia recently put it
like this: “The North Vietnamese are
only too well aware they can’t take
South Vietnam overnight. If the Soviet
Union, after 50 years of socialism, still
needs the help of big capitalist firms, so
will Hanoi when it comes to repairing
the damage of the war, so obviously
the South will operate under a sort of
interim mixed arrangement for a good
time to come.” This is a snappy para-
phrase of the Front’s program: mixed
economy, safeguards for foreign invest-
ment, the bourgeois freedoms.
But eventually the commissars will
take off their velvet gloves. There is a
world of difference between winning
over a people whose help you need and
organising them once the levers of
power are in your hands. That is the
tragedy of all revolutionaries, and
Vietnam is a country where tragedy
comes as regularly as the heavy mon-
soon rains.

Militant models
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
SHE PROBABLY rides to work in a
taxi, after an hour or two at the hair-
dresser’s, carrying changes of outer and
undergarments, extra shoes and stock-
ings, a choice of gloves, often a selec-
tion of wigs and hairpieces and of
jewellery. In turn she may be required
to appear aloof, regal, sultry, matronly,
demure, or a bit like the girl next
door but one. She is supposed to inhabit
an extra-dimensional world of glamor.
Who could have guessed that beneath
the frequently measured bustline beats
a heart of industrial militancy?
Well-known Melbourne mannequin,
Marcia Raphael, explains the situation
this way: “You need some looks, and
you need some training. You need en-
thusiasms and hygiene just as much.
But what we all need, brother, is a
strong union. At the moment we are
an exploited profession.” Trade? “Call
it whatever you like, though I reckon
we are a profession. We need higher
minimum, rates, we need a body to fix
ethical standards, and we need protec-
tion from the get-rich-quick merchants.
Do you know that some girls have to
wait as long as four and even six
months to get paid for a job?”
Another model with wide overseas
experience agreed, though she refused,
with reluctance, to let her name be
mentioned: “I am afraid that the model
agencies might put me on the blacklist.
I get a lot of work through them, and
I pay them ten percent commission on
the work I get by my own efforts.
Yes, I know it’s wrong, but it’s a kind
of insurance.” Blackmail? No, that was
too strong a word . . . “the agencies
perform a useful service,” she said.
This girl explained that she had read
the rules of the agencies with which
she deals and they asked for ten percent
of all work done irrespective of whether
they helped to obtain it. She did not
like having to pay for work she got her-
self, but added: “My real worry is the
time we have to wait for payments for
jobs. Some girls seem to get paid
quicker but with me it is often three or
four months before the cheque comes.
Sometimes there is a lot of work and
good money, other times things are
quiet, but it would be all much easier
if we could be assured of reasonably
prompt payment.”
She explained that in Europe, for
many assignments, the girls were paid
on the spot and later paid the agencies
commission if they had obtained the
work through them: “Here, it is be-
coming increasingly difficult to plan
ahead or to budget, although costs are
increasing.”
The increasing militancy of models
and mannequins in Victoria last
month they threatened to strike is
the result of their being caught in a
squeeze between higher costs of cloth-
ing, accessories, travelling and living ex-
penses, higher fees to agencies, but (ex-
cept for the few at the top), a static in-
come rate. Conflicts with agencies, fly-
by-night fashion promoters, photog-
raphers with telescopic bank accounts,
and the general set of spivs and racket-
eers who like to hang around pretty
girls, are aggravating factors.
In Queensland their agitation has led
to what they regard as a major profes-
sional achievement, the registration of
an Industrial Agreement under the
Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration
Act. The other parties to the agreement
are the Retailers’ Association, the
Association of Fashion Agents, and the
Master Photographers’ Association.
The Agreement has raised photog-
raphic models’ fees in many cases by
more than 100 percent, and mannequin
parade fees by 33 to 50 percent. For
the first time Queensland models have
an entitlement to meal ' breaks, rest
pauses, and double fees for Sundays
and public holidays. The Agreement
also covers cancellation fees, fares,
living away from home allowances, meal
money, and time involved for hair-
styling.
The clause which has sent a clamor
through Sydney and Melbourne is No.
3, which states:
“Fees shall be paid not later than
immediately following the completion
of the engagement, except where some
unforeseen occurrence increases the
amount of the fee beyond that antici-
pated whereupon the fee shall be made
available for collection not later than
one hour after bank opening time on
the next normal bank-trading day.”
The Mannequins and Models’ Guild
of Australia, which is the largest asso-
ciation of models, is concerned about
the kinds of contracts which girls are
induced to sign.
The standard contract with one Syd-
ney agency is normally offered for
signing without the figure of the per-
centage to be paid to the agency filled
in. Section 3 of the same contract reads:
“The model appoints the agent to be
her sole agent in all matters relating
to her modelling career, and the agent
or her agency shall accordingly be
entitled to the commission referred to
herein irrespective of whether the agent
or her agency should arrange a par-
ticular engagement.”
The next section states that the
model shall accept all engagements
obtained by the agency, and adds, “The
model hereby promises and agrees with

the agent that for a period of two years
from the termination of this agreement
she shall not employ another model
agency within a radius of five miles of
the City of Sydney.”
Many models do not work under
contracts and simply make a verbal
agreement to obey a set of rules of the
agency. One of their frequent com-
plaints about the agencies is that of
favoritism to girls who make no pro-
tests about payments and conditions.
One girl who has been agitating for
earlier payments has discovered that
her agency had announced her virtual
retirement to inquiring firms.
Mrs. Barbara Permezel, president of
the Mannequins and Models’ Guild of
Australia, has been one of the chief
agents in the consolidation of con-
ditions for models in Victoria, Perth,
and Canberra. Against strong opposi-
tion from some agencies and employers,
she has been working for the establish-
ment of a wages board to determine
and protect models’ payments and con-
■iitions.
The Guild is at present under strong
attack from some agencies which have
tried to force girls on their lists to
resign from it. A recent meeting of
models called by a Melbourne agency
was told that a wages board would
lower wages and weaken conditions.
One large agency is trying to set up a
rival union for models and manne-
quins now that it appears that a wages
board is likely to be appointed in Vic-
toria.
Models who support the guild have
threatened to call the Disputes Com-
mittee of the Melbourne Trades Hall
if a breakaway “company union” is
formed. A pamphlet war is now being
fought behind the scenes in which one
side alleges that some agencies do not
want a wages board, because that
would bring the modelling profession
under the supervision of the Depart-
ment of Labor and Industry and
rackets might be exposed; the other side
alleges that the guild does not have
the support of a majority of models.
What does appear certain is that
the more experienced models have
reached their limits of toleration of a
system in which agencies hold a lot of
arbitrary power over their careers. In
Melbourne, models have appointed an
industrial officer to fight a work-value
case before the anticipated wages
board. And some have threatened to
call a strike if the board is not created
soon.
Some of the younger models are torn
between loyalty to the union and
loyalty to or fear of their agencies and
employers. In the meantime, some
fashion houses are complaining the dis-
pute is building an unfavorable image
for the industry and creating a shortage
of mannequins. As the president of the
Mannequins’ Guild said: Please, Mrs.
Worthington, don’t put your daughter
on display.


THE BULLETIN REPORTS ON
THE WEST




THE PRINTING OF THIS REPORT IS SPONSORED BY . . .
THE GOVERNMENT OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA • ALCOA OF AUSTRALIA
STORY BY WALLACE CROUCH
PHOTOGRAPHS BY RICHARD WOLDENDORP
THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN GOVERN-
MENT these days produces a lot of maps. Maps of
the booming north-west iron-ore fields, of the spec-
tacular nickel finds near Kalgoorlie, of the areas
where 180 companies are exploring for minerals
and oils, of the Ord scheme and beef road networks
in the north, of the massive Esperance land develop-
ment scheme in the south-west. Yet as fast as these
maps come off the presses, cartographers have to
begin work on a revised set to note locations of new
land schemes, or new mineral strikes, or new towns
and ports.
Even private enterprise joins in this enthusiastic
map-making. The last annual report of the State’s
internal airline, Macßobertson Miller, has a map of
W.A. in which has been fitted, in exact scale, the out-
lines of the British Isles, Victoria, Tasmania and
Texas. “There is still,” says the text, “ample room for
some of Europe’s smaller countries.”
The newcomer to Perth when he first encounters
this unabashed boasting is apt to smile a little
sceptically; to doubt a little whether things are really
so good in this State which in the first 60 years of
Federation its own citizens regarded as the Cinderella
State, left alone by its rich eastern sisters to the task
of developing a capital-starved million-square-mile
territory, two-thirds of which was considered worth-
less. Then the stranger talks with big men —in
industry as well as Government with big ideas.
He is inundated with a flood of statistics and theories,
impressions and projections. Next he travels to the
north-west and the north and the south-west and
sees for himself the massive development much of
it on a scale unprecedented in Australia. Eventually
he must concede that this flexing of muscles by
Western Australians is justified.
In truth, Western Australia, with almost a third
of Australia’s land surface, yet less than a twelfth its
population, has taken off like a Saturn rocket, but
apart from sporadic upheavals on stock exchanges
the shock waves generated by this blast have scarcely
reached the Eastern States, let alone other countries.

The mineral boom grabs the honor and the headlines,
but there is development in a score of other activi-
ties, from wheat farming to prawning, so that W.A.
won’t wobble as it hurtles ahead. Western Aus-
tralia (call it “the West” if you like and the people
“Western Australians” but never “West Australia”)
is emerging as the new El Dorado, whose prospects
are matched only by its size. Grasping the total
significance of everything happening right now is
difficult enough. Simultaneously you have to cope
with the immense and exciting prospects of what’s
going to happen next. Even greater mineral dis-
coveries and exploitations. Atomic reactors in the
north. Tidal power harnessed. Imaginative irrigation
schemes to open up new regions and create com-
munities in what are now some of the most God-
forsaken tracts of dust in the world. New towns.
New industries. One is tempted to brush much of
it aside as the fanciful dreams of over-zealous
visionaries. Yet the planners already have the basic
blueprints, the economists the statistical pointers as
to how it all can be done. In the West, they’ve
developed a knack of making the barriers between
fantasy and reality crumble away.
Before the Great Dream becomes the Fantastic
Fact there are sizable obstacles to be hurdled.
Shortage of people is the biggest. Of some 877,000
people in W.A., about 568,000 live in the Perth-
Fremantle area. Next biggest concentration of
population is in the south-west. But people are spread
thinnest in the regions where they are most needed,
the north and north-west and where development is
most intense. With its own State migration program
(the 10,000 th arrival under this scheme, a five-year-
old Lancashire lass, Rachel Carlton, landed in
Fremantle recently) as well as getting a good share
of Commonwealth-sponsored migrants, the West’s
population has increased in the past five years by
120,000. W.A.’s population growth is 2.6 percent,
compared with the overall Commonwealth figure of
1.9 percent. If this trend continues, W.A. will have
more than a million people before 1973. But that
million won’t be sufficient if the State’s development
is to continue to accelerate. Even now though the
West has Australia’s lowest unemployment rate and


is getting a steady stream of Easterners migrating
across the Nullarbor the State is sorely short of
tradesmen, technicians, and semi-skilled workers,
and this, while not retarding current development
projects, may imperil future plans. The W.A.
Government, however, confidently believes more and
more people, from the Eastern States as well as
from overseas, can be lured to the West. The State’s
excellent climate (if you allow for the summer heat
and cyclones of the north), the friendly attitude of
Western Australians to new arrivals and the expand-
ing opportunities open to settlers are viewed as
guarantees of this. It’s largely a matter of getting the
message across.
“COURT-MAN IN
A HURRA”
GETTING MESSAGES across is a pre-occupation
of Charles Court, W.A.’s Minister for Industrial
Development and the North-West, the man largely
responsible for the investment in W.A. since 1960
of nearly SIOOO million overseas capital—-not far
short of the nation’s entire gold and foreign exchange
resources. In the Liberal-Country Party coalition
Government of Western Australia, Premier David
Brand, 56, former country shopkeeper, is the overall
guider and father-figure while Charles Court is the
hard-headed business “pro” whose zeal and negotia-
ting prowess have won him high respect in the
boardrooms of New York, London, and Tokyo.
Court’s slicing of red tape and his sometimes un-
orthodox methods of selling his State have ruffled
traditionalists in the W.A. Public Service, and some
of the diehards of Perth’s Establishment tend to
regard Court as a man too much in a hurry for
his State’s as well as his own sake. But Court has
already produced the goods the tapping of W.A.’s
mineral and other resources, even if it has meant
overseas interests dominating the West’s develop-
ment. Western Australia is where the action is, and
if the action gets bigger and noiser all the better
in Court’s view.
One might suspect this 56-year-old new-style
politician, who came from England to Perth as an
infant, who, as a young accountant, padded
earnings by playing the cornet in the ABC Military
Band, and who rose from private to Lieutenant-
Colonel in the Second AIF, is a parochialist. He
pleads that he isn’t, and says that in going all-out
to promote his State’s development he is in turn
boosting the national economy. One of the messages
Court strives to get across is that due to its own
prosperity W.A. has in the past two years increased
by a third its imports from the Eastern States. In
fact while it sold only sll6 million worth of goods
to the East last year, it imported $472 million worth,
thus directly providing employment for 100,000 in
the Eastern States. Court would like to see at least
some of these industries food processing, clothing,
building materials, etc. go West, not only to
supply Western Australians directly but to use
Fremantle Port as a gateway to Asian, African, and
European markets. Another argument Court uses is
that because of its own spiralling economy and
mineral royalties, W.A. is becoming less and less a
drain on Canberra’s finances.
At the start of the 19605, says Court, the average
Western Australian was a reasonably satisfied bloke,
living in a pleasant if undemanding environment.
The mineral boom, which has widened into the
Everything Rush, has led to the Western Australian
now believing that not only can he match the East
Australian in everything he has achieved; the man
in the West thinks he may be able to go one better.
“Chain reaction” is a favorite term of Court’s.
Mineral strikes, of course, were the energising fuel.
But they sparked other enterprises which now con-
tribute to the general prosperity. “In 1962 I pre-
dicted that within 100 years Western Australia
would have become the most important economic
unit in Australia. But considering how explosive the
boom has been, I’ve now revised this forecast to 50
years. We’re making our run for full development at
a time when the world is exploding technologically,
d he only limits on us are capacity to think and act
big. Frequently I’m criticised for making what is
regarded as a premature announcement on this new
iron-ore venture or that new irrigation scheme. But
I’m a great believer in committing yourself publicly.
It spurs you on. Put your flag to the mast, I say
then deal with the problems as they land on your
doorstep.”
Charles Court doesn’t want to be cured of his
optimism. He refuses to accept that the Johnson
Administration’s slashing of U.S. capital for over-
seas projects will retard W.A.’s growth. “When our
Government came into office,” he says, “the United
Kingdom was the dominant source of investment
funds. Then we got American capital. This, in turn,
emboldened Australians themselves to invest more
adventurously in their own mineral projects. Now
we have increasing Japanese capital coming into the
iron-ore projects when in the past they tended to
restrict their investment to services. Next, I am
certain we will see an influx of Continental and
European capital here, since it missed out on the
initial ventures. French industrialists have invited
me to go over and talk with them, and the Italians
are showing keen interest. If one door closes, then
another opens. Some years ahead, when we look back
in retrospect, we’ll regard these curbs, these declines
as minor difficulties.”
Based on his previous contacts with Mr. John
Gorton, Court believes the new Australian Prime
Minister will be an even bolder advocate of northern
development than Sir Robert Menzies or Harold
Holt. Typical of Court’s look-far-ahead philosophy


are his projections about the future of the Pilbara-
Ashburton area in W.A.’s north-west, where the
iron-ore action is. Court sees this region not only as
a quarry but as farming land. Right, says Court,
Pilbara-Ashburton has got or is getting four or five
of the world’s greatest mining ventures. From a
thinly distributed population of 3500 it will have,
by 1985, a population of 120,000. Under contracts
these iron-ore mines, together with their rail links
and loading ports, are committed to providing
certain segments of an iron-steel industry. At present
these industries get by on diesel power. Now they’re
moving into an era of oil-fired thermal stations. By
1977 they will be demanding power cheaper than
conventional methods can supply. This will mean at
least one 400-megawatt nuclear reactor in the region.
Along with greater quantities of power these indus-
tries, and the communities they support, will require
quantities of water far in excess of present demands.
So why not a total concept of regional development,
incorporating major dams, a co-ordinated power
supply, and irrigated agriculture? (In the Wet
season cyclones sweep in from the coast and dump
a tremendous amount of water on the outback
plains, which, left to itself, runs out to sea along
rivers like the Fortescue, Harding, Sherlock, Shaw,
and Coongan.)
With all this in mind, Court recently brought
to the region an American whose ability to plan
big approximates his own —David Lilienthal, 68,
chairman of the Development and Resources Cor-
poration, and a former head of the American Ten-
nessee Valley Authority and the U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission. Lilienthal flew over the region in an
executive jet, then went home to compile his report.
The sort of regional planning Court has in mind
envisages seven big dams on the rivers, which besides
ensuring enough water for the iron-ore industry
wpuld irrigate now-arid tracts where fruit and
vegetable could be grown and cattle fattened. The
cost between S4OO and SSOO million would
have to be borne by private capital. But considering
that more than S7OO million already has been spent
or committed in the same area by iron-ore ventures,
this sum —to Court’s way of thinking —is not
excessive.
Talk with John Knox in his Perth office and
you encounter more of this big thinking. Knox, 44,
last June became W.A.’s first Director-General of
Transport, a post unique in Australia. A chartered
engineer and a former national country marketing
manager for Shell, he heads an eight-man Transport
Authority with a SIOO,OOO annual research budget.
John Knox’s job is not to administer transport in
the West but to think ahead about it and to co-
ordinate it. This is a tough assignment, because next
to lack of population transport difficulties are the
West’s greatest single burden. What excites Knox
most about his job is that he and his colleagues
have the opportunity to evolve a completely new
“philosophy of transport,” learning from the en-
trenched mistakes of the Eastern States. This
philosophy, says Knox, is to provide users with a
choice of modes of transport, then gear those modes
to a wide range of cost and time alternatives. Knox’s
mind ranges from hovercraft and container ships
to mile-long iron-ore trains and short-hop jet planes.
Crux of the West’s transport problems is that with
the boom in the north there is a great movement of
men and material to that region but scant move-
ment southward of freight. That, plus the vast dis-
tances to be covered, and the fact the two roads
linking Perth with the north, the coastal one and
the inland one, via the Meekatharra railhead, are
easily cut in the wet season. The coastal road is
sealed only as far as 120 miles north of Carnarvon,
but with the Mount Newman iron-ore venture
gathering momentum a crash program is underway
to complete the bitumen run to the loading terminal,
Port Hedland.
Certainly, the end of this year should see a
significant breakthrough in the West’s transport pic-
ture completion of the last gap in the round-
Australia standard gauge rail link, 123 miles from
Koolyanobbing to Kalgoorlie. This will enable trains
to make a 60hr. Sydney-Perth run, giving real sub-
stance to appeals by the W.A. Government for
manufacturers in the East to rail their export goods
direct to Fremantle, as a more economical means than
shipping them to Asia and Europe out of Sydney
or Melbourne. W.A.’s prosperity boom, especially in
the north, has created unprecedented opportunities
for two segments of transport, long-distance road
hauliers and charter aircraft firms, of which there
are some 50 or 60 operators in the State. But it has
also placed heavy obligations on two long-established
services, Macßobertson Miller Airlines (affection-
ately dubbed the Mickey Mouse Airline) and the
State Shipping Commission. With its fleet of Fokker
Friendships and DC3s, Knox says, MM A does a
magnificent job, serving 90 ports of call in the West,
but it is passenger-orientated and inadequately
equipped to cope with the rising volume of freight
traffic. MMA at present is considering introducing
F2Bs, the pure jet version of the Friendship, but the
feasibility of establishing an all-freight air cargo
service using aircraft the size of RAAF Hercules
transports cannot be overlooked. Similarly, the
State Shipping Commission, with seven of its own
vessels and several others under charter, is sorely
pressed supplying the north in a basically one-way
traffic. One revolutionary new type of ship the Com-
mission is considering introducing is the LASH
(Lighter Aboard Ship) vessel. These ships, of 6000
tons (twice the tonnage of the present ones), could
each carry up to 25 barges, and each barge able
to land 200 tons of cargo. LASH ships, at speeds of
30 knots or more, would halve the present sailing


time from Fremantle to northern ports- —and the
loading and unloading techniques used on the barges
more than halve the turnaround time in port. Says
John Knox, “Here in the West we’ve got a God-
given opportunity to get our transport operations
right and w'ith the right sort of money, scientific
planning, and imagination we’ll do it.”
CHANGING FACE
OF PERTH
THE VIEW FROM the tenth-floor Council House
office of Perth Lord Mayor Tom Wardle takes in
the serpentine Swan River and huge mounds of sand
stacked along the Esplanade foreshore. The blue
waters of the Swan, Mr. Wardle better known in
the East as “Tom the Cheap Grocer,” whose cut-
price tactics and chain of 165 stores have now in-
vaded every State except Queensland admires,
but not quite as much as what those sand piles
represent. The sand is there as landscaping for a
$2O million Mitchell freeway, a complex maze of
roadways, tunnels, bridges which will connect with
the existing high-speed roads to Fremantle and be
able to accommodate the city’s traffic flow at least to
the year 2000. Certainly the inner sections of the
freeway will be completed by 1985, by when Perth’s
population will have doubled to a million and
300,000 more vehicles will be on its roads. Perth’s
natural beauty is not to be sacrificed for expediency.
The heart of the freeway complex, the Narrows
Interchange, will have ornamental lakes, waterfall,
landscaped lawns, picnic spots, and thousands of
trees and shrubs. If nothing else in Perth does, the
skeletofi form of the freeway points up the fact that
in this one-time sleepy, leisurely paced city as in
the rest of W.A. people are thinking and plan-
ning big. Already there are echoes in Perth of the
boom prosperity which is sweeping all over the
State. It has peak-hour traffic congestion, perhaps
not as bad as that in cities like Sydney and Mel-
bourne and certainly not at a build-up rate which in
ten or 20 years a freeway like the Mitchell won’t be
able to handle. It has a rapidly growing population
and a suburban sprawl which has forced up the price
of home-building land—to as much as $lO,OOO an
average block in suburbs like City Beach and
resulting in the upthrust of home-unit blocks in
such inner suburbs as South Perth. There is talk of
hydrofoils on the Swan and the building of an under-
ground or ground-level rapid-transit suburban train
service, but all projects will have to be fitted into a
20-year master plan the city fathers have approved.
Indicative of the extent of Perth’s, and W.A.’s,
building boom is the decision by the big sheet-steel
manufacturer John Lysaght (Aust.) to convert its
plant at Myaree (a Perth suburb) from a hitherto
distributing centre for products imported from its
works in the East to a manufacturing centre in its
own right. As a result of $150,000 additions to its
Myaree plant, Lysaght is already producing roll-
formed steel roofing there, later this year will produce
flat sheets, and has the objective of satisfying W.A.’s
demand for all types of roof and wall steels within a
few years.
Perth already has a proliferation of new office
blocks, modest in height and size by the standards
of Sydney’s and Melbourne’s multi-storeyed monsters,
but attractively designed. At present 24 inner-city
projects have been approved blocks costing from
$850,000 to $2 million and including a ten-storev
hotel in Mill Street. The scramble for office space is
intense. Until now many of the big companies with
stakes in W.A.’s gigantic development projects, and
some Government agencies, have had to make do
with converted cottages, but more are moving into
air-conditioned office blocks. Says Lord Mayor
Wardle, who last November won the post despite
no previous civic experience and will recontest it
in May, “You’ve only got to look around you to
appreciate that we in this State, and in this city,
are on the move. Six or so years ago we all used to
laugh at what the visionaries called the Great
Awakening. Not any more. It’s a bit like living in
a separate country. But don’t mark me down as a
secessionist. That sort of thinking went out the door
years ago.” On one score Perth can already do a lot
of boasting its magnificent airport, with a
10,500 ft. runway, the longest existing civil runway
in Australia, and a terminal building considered the
best in Australia. Perth Airport is ready to take
Jumbo jets, and its runway could be extended to
14,000 ft., to take the supersonic airliners, without
any land resumptions. This $B5 million air-
port is already Australia’s fourth largest—besides
interstate and intrastate traffic it handles inter-
national traffic, Qantas, BOAC, Air India, South
African Airways, and Malaysian-Singapore Airlines —
and is geared for almost unlimited expansion.
While the transformations which are jolting
Perth are largely manifesting themselves more in
physical forms, like the $6 million 19-storey Com-
monwealth Government office block at its eastern
end, its people, too, are changing, if less perceptibly.
The quickening of tempo of life so far mainly affects
the higher-echelon business community and Govern-
ment circles; for Mr. Average in Perth the rat-race
has scarcely yet begun. But the community at large
is generally becoming more cosmopolitan in content
(2500 Americans, for example, now live in the city,
and there is a constant stream in and out of Euro-
pean, Japanese, and other foreign businessmen and

technicians) and in attitudes. More and more
Perthites are enjoying the good life, eating at ex-
cellent restaurants, equipping homes with swimming-
pools, owning two family cars and perhaps a power-
or sail-boat on the Swan, and keeping up —especially
the teenage girls with newest fashion trends in
the East. They’re keen to build a second university
(the University of Western Australia itself is ex-
panding so fast its new buildings are spilling down
to the Swan foreshore) and they are determined to
make their Perth Festival (held this year from
February 3 to March 9, and featuring such diverse
activities as a Nolan Retrospect Exhibition and the
Great Moscow Circus) as culturally attractive as
Adelaide’s. But talk and thought is focused on the
prosperity, the big money to be made. Says a Perth
taxi-driver, “This is the place of the future, sport.
The thing is to get in on the ground floor now
open a garage, start a factory, get yourself a good
white-collar job. You can’t bloody well go wrong!”
NEW GATEWAY
FOR INDUSTRY
FOR SOME TIME the Federal Government has
been considering establishing a huge naval base at
Cockburn Sound, just south of Fremantle, to give
the RAN a two-ocean capability. It has had private
consulting engineers make feasibility studies. But as
yet Canberra has given no final decision. Naval base
or not, Charles Court and the Western Australian
Government are pressing ahead with their own plans
to seal off Cockburn Garden, with a two-mile,
1200 ft.-wide breakwater from the mainland at Cape
Peron to Garden Island, creating a 32 sq. mile deep-
water anchorage, one of the mightiest man-made
harbors in the world, . where, according to one
estimate, as many as 1000 vessels at a time could
shelter. The reasons for such sweeping plans are
obvious. Fremantle, W.A.’s main port, is bursting at
the seams and even with expansion and modernisa-
tion projects now underway can’t hope to cope with
the fantastic volume of sea traffic expected in the
next half century. Additionally, there is Kwinana,
only a few miles away a multi-million-dollar in-
dustrial complex now moving into top gear and con-
stantly growing. What the W.A. Government has in
mind, initially, at Cockburn Sound is a $lO million
graving dock capable of handling 100,000-tonners —
a project beyond the State Government’s own re-
sources. So the Government has asked the Dilling-
ham Corporation of Australia to examine the pro-
posal; Dillinghams would build and operate a major
ship docking, surveying, repairing, and building
industry there.
Less than 15 years ago Kwinana was a stretch
of deserted sandhills overlooking the Indian Ocean
and dotted with a few rusting hulks. Today it is a
clutter of industries whose investment value totals
more than $3OO million. When Kwinana is fully
developed, the outlying residential area of Fremantle-
Rockingham is expected to have a population of
200,000 and a workforce of 80,000. The take-off
year for Kwinana was 1951 when British Petroleum
decided to build a refinery there. The refinery is still
the nation’s largest, and additions to it since it
opened in 1955 have made its value over $lOO
million. It employs about 900 people. Other industries
operating at Kwinana include a steel-pipe plant and
a cement manufacturing plant, and those nearing com-
pletion include a nitrogenous fertiliser plant, an oil-
fired power station, a rail terminal and marshalling
yards. Another major segment of the Kwinana com-,
plex is the alumina refinery operated by Western
Aluminium, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcoa of
Australia. Bauxite for the refinery comes by special rail
link from Jarrahdale, in the Darling Ranges, 30
miles south of Perth. Bauxite comes in at the rate
of 29,000 tons a week, but with 500 million tons in
the known reserves at Jarrahdale, the refinery has
a long life ahead of it. The Alcoa refinery began pro-
duction in 1963 with 210,000 tons of alumina a year;
it is now in the process of quadrupling that amount.
Some 80 percent of the alumina refined at Kwinana
is exported to Japan and the U.S. under long-term
contracts; the rest goes to Alcoa’s own aluminium
production plant at Point Henry, near Geelong
(Vic.). Whether the company establishes a second
aluminium smelter plant at Kwinana is being con-
sidered on the economics of such a project; how fast
world and Australian markets are growing, and power
costs involved, as the aluminium industry is prob-
ably the greatest single industrial user of electricity.
Dominating the Kwinana skyline at the moment is
a $4O million blast furnace, which, when it comes into
operation on April 1, will mark another vital stage in
Western Australia getting its own fully integrated
iron and steel works, Australia’s most modern. Aus-
tralian Iron and Steel (a BHP subsidiary) is com-
mitted to having this industry fully operational by
1978, and the blast furnace, like other already estab-
lished plants in the AIS complex, is ahead of
schedule. AIS is already drawing its iron-ore supplies
from Koolyanobbing, which is linked with Fremantle
by standard rail gauge. Koolyanobbing, on the
western fringe of the Kalgoorlie goldfields, has
known iron-ore reserves to last 60 years. The blast
furnace will add 750 employees to the 510 men
already employed in the company’s steel-rolling mill
and 100 men at the Koolyanobbing mine. Now
Kwinana is to get another “baby” - a $45 million
refinery for the great nickel deposits Western Mining
Corporation is scooping out at Kambalda, near
Kalgoorlie. W.A. Premier David Brand calls this
“one of the most exciting stages of our mining his-
tory.”
The Kwinana plant will be Australia’s first
nickel refinery, and when fully operational will pro-


duce not less than 15,000 tons of refined nickel a
year. It will mean new railway links, new ancillary
services, new townships and, because of the work-
force it will create, a likely speeding-up of a $l5O
million private housing project, a satellite city, the
W.A. Government has planned for the residential
area adjoining Kwinana, Rockingham. The Rock-
ingham project envisages housing 35,000 people in
10,000 homes and flats within 15 years, and a civic
and commercial centre the size of Fremantle’s.
Among its revolutionary features is the linking of all
living and recreation areas by underground pedes-
trian walkways, thus giving people complete safety
of movement. But even more, the recently announced
nickel refinery project at Kwinana points up the
need for pushing ahead with a new, vast ocean outlet
like Cockburn Sound. There can be no quarrel about
the expansion going on in Fremantle Port itself
it already has probably the best passenger terminal
in the country and some of the most sophisticated
cargo-handling gear. And as part of a $l7 million
facelift it is getting a large berth, and possibly a
second, to handle container ships, which are expected
to begin arriving early next year. But within ten
years Fremantle, which is an accurate barometer to
W.A.’s surging prosperity, will be called on to handle
double its present volume of trade. After that, be-
cause the harbor itself poses severe physical limita-
tions, chaos could set in. So the Cockburn Sound
proposal, despite the immensity of planning and work
it involves, is a reasonable indicator of the Govern-
ment’s determination to look ahead and look
ahead far!
KIMBERLEYS—A
LAST FRONTIER
IN THE KIMBERLEYS, that sparsely populated
162,000-square-mile chunk of brick-red earth in
Western Australia’s northernmost corner, the tempo
of activity has slipped into low gear. This is
because of The Wet, and as humidity saps a man’s
energy, cyclonic rains cut his roads and disrupt his
work. Last November the Federal Government gave
the green light for a start to the most controversial
of all development projects in Australia’s north
the main dam in the Ord River Scheme. The dam,
to store 3.5 million acre feet of water, and associated
facilities to irrigate 148,000 acres of land will cost
at least $75.6 million. Canberra has promised a
$20.9 million grant for the dam and a $27.2 million
interest-bearing loan for the irrigation work. The
W.A. Government has to find the rest of the finance.
For the moment the site of the dam, 30 miles
upstream from the completed diversion dam, is
devoid of activity. Only four-wheel-drive vehicles
can get to it. But once The Wet peters out, about
April, the 1968 program of access roads and camp
preparation will begin. The plan is for the contractors
to start the main job in the 1969 dry season. Mean-
time, the critics of the Ord Scheme don’t let up. In
Perth recently, Australian physicist Sir Mark
Oliphant described the Ord Scheme as “scrappy”
and “artificial” and said the irrigated farms there
would not create a viable community. The W.A.
Government and Charles Court counter that the Ord
is a bold experiment, but one that can succeed and
provide the breakthrough for tropical agriculture
in the north. They emphatically reject the claim
that the Ord is simply in W.A.’s selfish interests; one
third of the land to be irrigated by the main dam
lies in the Northern Territory. They point to the
success of the initial stage of the Ord Scheme
the sl6 million diversion dam whose waters already
irrigate 30,000 acres, the 32 farms and township of
Kununurra, where people, among them a handful
of Americans, are happy and prospering, the
successful cotton shipments already sent through the
port of Wyndham, the second cotton ginnery being
built, and the high hopes of farmers there of
economical grain sorghum crops.
The pro-Ordites also reject the idea that the
irrigation scheme is a completely isolated develop-
ment in the Kimberleys. Other things are happening
in the region, they say; perhaps not as spectacularly,
not as fast-paced as, say, in the iron-ore treasure
trove of the north-west, but still providing the barest
of foundations for regional development. For
example, beef roads. The Commonwealth-State
program provides for s3l million to be spent to
1974 on building and upgrading roads in the
Kimberleys, with nearly S2O million of this already
spent. The increasing numbers of fatter cattle now
being hauled to the meatworks at Wyndham, Derby,
and Broome already more that justify this expendi-
ture. The long-established iron-ore mines in Yampi
Sound, Koolan, and Cockatoo Islands also provide
pieces for the jigsaw pattern of development. The
cultured - pearl enterprises, especially the joint
Australian-Japanese-U.S. venture at Kuri Bay, fit
into this pattern.
However, the operative word for a breakthrough
in opening up the Kimberleys on a massive scale is
that magic one, minerals. Prospects are good.
American Metal Climax Inc. (Amax) has four
temporary bauxite reserves south of Admiralty Gulf.
For more than two years it has been investigating
these deposits and now has 40 men there, drilling,
shaft-sinking, and bulk-sample testing. It has already
spent $1.5 million on the project, has allotted $1
million more this year. The company’s immediate
objective is to determine whether the deposits justify
building an alumina plant there. This would mean
the expenditure of at least S9O million in an area
about the size of Tasmania which has no industries,
no towns, a white population (excluding the bauxite
men) measured in dozens, but fertile soil, good
rainfall, and, of course, those surging ocean tides of


30ft. or more, which have already been earmarked
as a potential source of a great power supply. So
far Amax has located between 50 million and 75
million tons of bauxite —100 million tons would
make mining and processing economically feasible.
After bauxite, then what? Quite likely large-scale
finds of uranium in the Kimberleys, because as the
world moves toward the 1970 s and an era of nuclear
power there will be a great demand for uranium
again. Uranium seems certain to be the fuel for
the 1980 s, and it could become the speculative metal,
replacing nickel, to boost share prices. When the
people in the West talk about having only scratched
the surface of their State, they have particularly in
mind that last great frontier area of the Kimberleys.
Yet another treasure trove of minerals? The proof
is not yet final but the evidence highly encouraging.
A MOUNTAIN
OF ORE
AT 6000 FT. the push-pull engine Cessna bucks
violently. On the mountains below the ground
temperature is 112 degrees and the hot thermals shoot
up high. We are over the Hamersley Range, scene of
the great iron-ore explosion and where people,
money, and machinery are daily pouring in to
extract the vast mineral wealth which has a future
equal to or greater than the Ruhr industrial complex
of Europe. This is still a harsh, terrible land.
Twenty-four-year-old Jan Ende, chief pilot of Trans-
West charter airline, based at Port Hedland, tells
how a mountain came to be named in his honor.
Not long ago a helicopter dropped two geologists
on a lonely peak to test it for minerals. The men
were supposed to stay there for a few hours, but
the chopper developed magneto trouble and was
grounded miles away. With little water and in the
shocking heat the two stranded men faced death.
Ende was called in, but supply canisters he dropped
smashed on the rocks. Finally he wrapped food and
water cans in tyre tubes and mattresses and, flying
at 20ft. altitude, bounced them down to the men.
Three days later, when the chopper got the men off
the peak, they told Ende they’d named it Mount
Ende . . .
The roadside sign just outside Mount Tom Price
reads, “Growing Town. Growing Children. Drive
Slowly.” Some growing town! A few years ago there
was nothing, except the red earth, the spinifex, and
a few tents. Today it is a township of 150 houses
(215 by next May, 400 by early 1969), a super-
market, swimming-pool, tennis court, community
centre, police lock-up (seldom used) —everything
neat, ultra-modern, and air-conditioned. In the bar
of the Mount Tom Price motel the talk is about the
new SU.S.SO million contract Hamersley Iron Pty.
Ltd. has just concluded to sell iron ore to Japanese
steel mills, bringing the company’s Japanese contracts
to a total of almost $llOO million. By 1972 Hamersley
will be shipping 12,800,000 tons of ore a year to
Japan, perhaps 20 million by 1980. So there’s a
round of toasts to the legendary Lang Hancock, the
W.A. prospector who in 1952 spotted the ore-studded
mountain from his plane, and to the now dead Tom
Price, who assessed its fantastic potential and
persuaded his company, the Kaiser Steel Corporation
of America, to join with Conzinc Riotinto of
Australia to form the consortium to mine the
mountain which bears his name. A half hour’s
Land-Rover drive from the township is Mount Tom
Price, the world’s biggest single lump of high-grade
hematite iron ore more than 500 million tons.
From the distance, Tom Price looks like many other
mountains in the Hamersley Range—hump-backed,
purple-blue in the early morning light. At closer
range you see how man and machines are tearing
and gouging into its face. Everything at the mine
site is big the 100-ton ore trucks, the mechanical
scoops which lift 25 tons of ore in a single shovelful,
the gigantic crusher and screening units.
The heat in the pit is terrific, up to 150 deg.
Sometimes the machines get too hot to touch. The
red dust swirls high and coats everything. The noise
is shattering, the activity intense. It goes on far into
the night, seven days a week. Mine man? ~r George
Mackay, a burly South African who learnt his skills
on Johannesburg’s Rand, says Tom Price began
shipping out ore early last year, and by March, 1969,
will have doubled its screening and crushing process.
Of his labor force, 10 percent come from Western
Australia, 40 percent from the Eastern States, and
50 percent are overseas immigrants. It’s like the
early days of the Snowy Scheme all over again
Italians, Yugoslavs, Maltese, Germans, Swedes, even
a couple of Icelanders. But the single men don’t
stay long “If you can get six months out of a
bloke you’re doing well.” There’s nothing wrong
with the conditions for single men air-conditioned
quarters, the very best of grub, plenty to drink, and
big money to be earned up to $l3O, $l4O a week,
with free keep. It’s just that so many of the bachelors
want to make a packet, then move on or back to
Perth to live it up. This is why Hamersley, like
other iron-ore companies, gives top priority to its
house-building projects homes that cost $32,000
to build, equipped with basic furniture and air-
conditioning, and let for a nominal rental of $6 a
week, including power and water. Life in Australia’s
tropical north is certainly changing.
EVERYTHING IS BIG
AT DAMPIER
AT DAMPIER, Tom Barlow, Hamersley’s
operations boss in Western Australia, invites you to


take a long cold glass of seawater from the town’s
new $750,000 desalination plant, Australia’s biggest.
It tastes just fine, except for a slight fishy odor if
you sniff in the glass, a problem posed by the heavy
plankton content of the water in King Bay. Still,
the plant is able to produce 400,000 gallons of water
a day, against the 50,000 gallons a day Dampier
could only get from its previous supply source,
Miaree Pond, on a river 20 miles away. Tom Barlow
is only 38, a mining engineer with previous
experience at Broken Hill, Rum Jungle, and Strad-
broke Island. He is as tough as the ore he produces,
and typical of a new breed of in-the-field Australian
development executive, knowledgeable and highly
efficient. Like Tom Price, Dampier is a Hamersley
company town, but even younger. It’s the loading
port at the end of the 182-mile railway from Mount
Tom Price along which two, sometimes three, mile-
long trains a day each bring 15,000 tons of ore for
shipment to Japan, Europe, or the U.S. Like Tom
Price it’s neat, tidy, with 220 workers’ houses to
rise to 500 by mid-1969. All it lacks at the moment
are the sealed roads and little blobs of green lawn
Tom Price has. Tom Barlow shows his newest
infant a S4O million plant for processing fine ore
into pellets. After a few teething troubles it should
be operating soon. Even so, the pellet plant with
two million tons annual capacity will be opera-
ting many months ahead of the schedule laid down
in the original contract. Captain Denis Holden,
Dampier’s assistant marine superintendent, a former
seafarer from Cheshire (Eng.), who has now settled
for a landlubber’s job, shows you his “baby” the
long jetty with its massive machinery and fastest
ore-conveyor and loading system in the world.
Holden is beaming. He is about to supervise the
loading of 91,000 tons of ore into the world’s largest
ore-carrier, the Sigsilver, of 104,000 deadweight tons.
But then, like Tom Price, everything to do with
Dampier is BIG. Last year Dampier shipped out
five million tons or ore. This year it will ship out ten
million tons. By 1972 from the mountainous stock-
piles of ore, plus the pellet stockpile, it will be
shipping out 20 million tons. This will mean further
dredging of the port, further extensions to the jetty.
But it’ll be done, and most probably well ahead of
schedule.
If the statistics the men at Dampier cite make
the senses reel, then the physical accomplishments
at the port itself dazzle the eye. After all, a couple
of years ago this was a stretch of desert running
down to the sea. Nobody lived here. Now Tom
Barlow and his staff work in a modern air-
conditioned office which would do any capital city
office block proud. It even has a fountain in the
foyer. The Mermaid Motel has comfortable beds,
carpeted bars, and a superb cuisine. In the shopping
centre women buy the week’s groceries in cool
comfort. They are brightly dressed without that
washed-out appearance of white women living in the
tropics of past days. Their menfolk build sail-boats
in backyards, their kids go to a local school, and
they work out plans for a new swimming enclosure
on Dampier’s sandy beach and a nine-hole golf-
course on the dusty plains inland. For the folk of
Dampier the only real worry are those damned
cyclones which sweep in this time of the year. You
learn from experience, say the older residents. Last
year Bertha, with winds of 135 mph, hit Dampier.
The townsfolk parked all their cars in a quarry
down near the loading site. When they came out
next morning only the roofs of the vehicles were
visible above a sheet of water. The pelting rains had
caused a landslide at the quarry’s entrance and
sealed it off as an instant dam. Life at Dampier?
Well, if you can forget the isolation, get along with
your neighbors, tolerate the summer heat, and don’t
miss TV, it can be tremendous.
HARD WORK-
BIG MONEY
ON TOP OF MOUNT WHALEBACK, Dirk Baas,
40, himself a mountain of a man, toils and sweats.
The heat is searing, the dust suffocating. But Dirk has
never been happier. “Why?” he grunts. “The big
money, man. I used to drive a bus in Perth. Forty
dollars a week. Here I can make a hundred and
thirty-five a week. Plus lodgings and any amount of
food free. When they get the houses built I’ll bring
up the wife and three kids.” Dirk, a Dutchman,
served in his country’s Army in Indonesia. He is one
of 260 men baring the sides of Whaleback, in W.A.’s
Ophthalmia Range, ready for another vast iron-ore
mining venture the $2OO million Mount Newman
project. One of Dirk’s mates is bearded Irishman
Jack Connolly, 47, who has worked in the oilfields
of Canada, the mines of New Zealand, and the
Snowy project. “Some of the guys here, not all,
sometimes talk about the significance of these iron-
ore jobs,” he says, “about the dollars and cents they
mean to Australia and the tremendous stake it’s all
giving us in the future. My family is still in Alberta
and I’m a bit older than most of the characters
here. But I get on well with them. The Aussie’s
attitude is to accept you for what you prove yourself
to be.” The Mount Newman project is still in its
infancy, without the township or comforts of a
Tom Price. The feeling of loneliness, of isolation is
even greater here. The scenery is breathtaking. But

Whaleback itself is the centre of attention a great
chunk which is literally 345 million tons of iron ore
of high-grade 64 percent content. At least they are
the reserves already proved. There could be, say the
geologists, 1000 million tons of ore in the surrounding
countryside. Everything happening at the Whaleback
site, and at Port Hedland, the loading port 260 miles
to the north-west, and at the construction camps
which will lay the rail-tracks over tortuous terrain
in between, is geared to a date April 1, 1969.
That’s when the Mount Newman consortium has to
load into a carrier in Port Hedland its first shipment
of iron ore; the consortium has an initial 15-year
contract with Japanese steel mills for 100 million
tons worth well over $750 million one of the
biggest raw material purchases ever made. Yearly
shipments will rise from 3 million to 1\ million tons
within four years. By then there’ll be a familiar
development pattern at Whaleback; a township of
170 houses, swimming-pool, supermarket, police
station, and slabs of bright green lawn. For the
moment there’s no let-up at the site; men work 11
or 12 hours a day; six days a week, and by April
there’ll be full-night shifts worked by the glare of
arc lamps. During daylight the men pause only to
gulp down a few salt tablets, glass after glass of
lemon squash (heavy beer-drinking is confined to the
evenings), and grab a meal anything from broiled
steaks to smorgasbord at the air-conditioned
messes, where the chefs are white-hatted and have
electric dishwashers in their kitchens.
In the mess queue you meet a dirt-streaked
young man by the name of Richard Court. Charles
Court’s son drives a fuel truck, roughs it with the
mob, and shies off publicity. There are few off-duty
diversions for the men at Whaleback. Not a woman
there yet. No swimming-hole. But good wild turkey
shoots. One bloke collects pythons for zoos in the
cities. The problem here is the same as at Tom Price
a big turnover, as high as 200 percent, of bachelor
workers. So next to the ore mine itself, building the
township gets top priority; by April the first 90
houses for families should be completed. Gradually
the feeling of isolation is being reduced. Perched on a
hill near Whaleback is a tall transmitter tower, which
gives the camp a direct radio-telephone link with
Perth. Standard Telephones and Cables Pty. Ltd.
have a $1 million contract to build Australia’s
biggest private telecommunications link between
Whaleback and Port Hedland—it built a similar tele-
phone-radio relay link from Tom Price to Dampier.
MMA planes come into the airstrip, eight miles
away, four times a week, and there are charter flights
in from Port Hedland six days a week. When a rain
deluge closes the road from Meekatharra, there’s
always a helicopter on standby at Port Hedland for
emergency flights to take out a sick man, or bring
in a few barrels of beer. As it builds up its workforce,
Mount Newman intends making a bold experiment,
something rare in W.A. employing, on award pay-
rates and conditions, several of a tribe of Aborigines
who now camp in a few gunyahs on the site’s
outskirts. Things are most definitely changing out
West.
A PORT IN
UPHEAVAL
“THE ORE DUST A NUISANCE?” growls Angus
Richardson. “Look, brother, when it clogs the cash
registers we can start complaining!” Richardson, 53,
is president of Port Hedland Shire Council, a
prosperous grazier, butcher, and cartage contractor.
What’s happening to this township has scarcely yet
been grasped by many of its oldtimers. As recent as
1950, Port Hedland was a scruffy town of 750
people, dilapidated houses, all hemmed in by useless
mangrove swamps and tidal flats. It shipped out a
bit of wool, some manganese from a mine 250 miles
away, and gold from the Marble Bar mine. Port
Hedland had, in fact, just about had its chips. Then
came the first shockwave from the iron-ore explosion.
The first of the big projects, Mount Goldsworthy,
laid a rail link from its mine 70 miles away to
Finucane Island, a few hundred yards across the
harbor, dredged the harbor, built a wharf, and ore-
handling equipment, and made the town the new
focus of northern development, replacing
Kununurra. But the jolt created in Port Hedland
by the Goldsworthy venture, with its contracts to
ship over 20 million tons of ore to Japan, is a squib
compared with the impact the Mount Newman
project is making on the port. A few miles out of
town there’s a scene which resembles a D-Day beach-
head operation —a massive stockpile of 870,000
railway sleepers and thousands of tons of steel rails,
which are to provide the 260-mile link with Whale-
back. In the harbor two of the world’s largest
dredges, the Alameda and the Kokuei Maru (the
latter with 60 Japanese on board), are each pumping
20,000 cubic yards of silt a day to create mile after
mile of new land on which the Newman loading
operation will be mounted. The dredging and
reclamation project alone is worth sl6 million.
There is a completely new township to be built,
miles from the present one, which can’t escape the
fine red ore dust drifting across the harbor from the
Goldsworthy loading wharf. Within a few years this
township will have 4000 residents. Ultimately it will
accommodate 30,000, plus a light industrial zone to
accommodate the inflow of everything from pastry
shops to transport maintenance sheds. There is
already a new 32-bed hospital and two new motels,
whose facilities and comfort are a far cry from the
town’s two ramshackle pubs, famous for boozing and
brawling. One of the new motels, the Walkabout,
close to the airstrip, is built in Spanish hacienda-


style. Every brick in it was fired on the site. Port
Hedland has just got its first radio station. And when
the cyclones sweep in, the new drive-in movie screen
can be folded flat on the ground at a few minutes’
warning. Angus Richardson tells you that eventually
Port Hedland will yearly be handling a greater
tonnage of exports than does Sydney Harbor.
“Imagine,” he says, “fewer than 15 years from now
there’ll be two or three of the biggest ships in the
world a day coming up that harbor. Makes you feel
you really belong to some place important. Of
course, we’ve still got a problem or two here. Like
the 250 Aborigines around the town. Nice sort of
blokes, but not much work value in them. Grog’s
got them beaten, unfortunate devils.”
Piece together the complete iron-ore picture in
Western Australia and it comes out something like
this: Already eight major companies have signed
contracts with the W.A. Government to exploit the
State’s measured or inferred resources of 15,000
million tons, with an iron content of at least 50
percent. Contracts worth some S2OOO million have
been signed between Japanese steelmen and the
mining companies, and over the next decade iron-ore
sales will add at least $16,000 million to the national
income as Japan, now the world’s third-largest
steelmaker, draws a third of its ore from Australia.
Some of the profits of iron ore will leave the country
in the form of dividends to overseas investors, but
this will represent a small cost compared with the
net gain of overseas currencies in the nation’s balance
of payments. Under their agreements the mining
companies are broadly committed to provide segments
of an iron and steel industry in the West, and of the
S6BO million earmarked for development in the
north-west, some will be spent turning out metalised
iron. But there is not much chance of new fully
integrated iron and steel plants if only because, at
present, there are far too many steel plants through-
out the world.
Following Goldsworthy, Hamersley, and New-
man, the next big venture in the north-west will be
the SIOO million Cleveland Cliffs project (with
Australian, Japanese, and U.S. capital), already
beyond the planning stage, to mine a 3000-million-
ton deposit in the Robe River area (these are
limonite ores, not of such high grade as the hematites
at the three other mines), with a new rail link to
Cape Lambert, where another port and a pellet plant
will be established. Development of Cape Lambert
fits in with proposals by the Hanwright partnership
(Messrs. Lang Hancock and E. A. Wright) to
exploit their 100-million-ton deposit of hematite ore
at Wittenoom, in the Hamersley Range, close to the
site of the now closed asbestos mine. A third proposal
involves Sentinel Mining Co., an offshoot of the
international D. K. Ludwig organisation, which has
offered to sell million tons of high-grade iron
ore to Japan—from a mine to be established at
Nimingarra, 90 miles from Port Hedland. A 37-mile
railway would link the mine with a new port to be
built on the nearest sea outlet, Cape Keraudren, and
deliveries begun in 1971. All this in a region about
which a W.A. Government geologist, H. P. Wood-
ward, wrote in 1888, “Iron ore occurs in tremendous
lodes . . . there is enough to supply the whole world
should present supplies run out. But as iron ores are
of no value, it is useless to trouble about them.”
A FORTUNE
FROM SALT
MR. CLAIRE LOPEZ and Mr. S. (“Lolly”)
Amaral are Californians who’ve spent most of their
lives in the salt industry. When they go back to the
States next year they’ll leave behind at Port Hedland
one of the world’s largest solar salt ventures with an
Australian manager, Ray Bengough, and a work
force of 80. As the hungry steel mills of Japan need
W.A.’s iron ore, so Japanese chemical and other
industries require vast quantities of salt from the
State. More than 90 percent of the world’s salt
output is used for industrial purposes, and by the
early 1970 s production of industrial salt by solar
evaporation of seawater and by harvesting naturally
occuring brines from inland salt lakes will amount to
a big industry in the West. Japanese interests predict
that landed prices for W.A. salt will be lower than
that produced by Mexico Japan’s present main
supplier because of the shorter shipping haul.
Japanese chemical plants are now gobbling up
imported salt at the rate of nearly 4,000,000 tons a
year, and the demand steadily grows. Indeed, it was
Japanese businessmen flying over the north-west
corner of W.A. who first enthused about the area’s
potential, with its great tidal flats, low rainfall, and
high evaporation, as a solar salt producer. Already
one company, formed by Perth businessman Garrick
Agnew, has spent $4 million on a salt venture at
Shark Bay., south of Carnarvon, with profitable
results it has already shipped salt to Japan, and
by the 1970 s expects to be producing 1.5 million
tons a year. Further north, at the new iron-ore port
of Dampier, Dampier Salt Ltd., a joint venture of
Australian and Japanese interests, has leased 28,600
acres of tidal flats (with an option on another 9000
acres) to establish a $5 million export solar salt
industry. Initially the venture will produce 650,000
tons a year, rising to a million tons. It expects to
make its first salt shipment to Japan in 1970.
The venture at Port Hedland that the Cali-
fornians have been setting up is operated by the
Leslie Salt Company, America’s biggest single
producer. It represents an $8 million investment,
embraces a total of 18,000 acres, by 1969 will be
producing 500,000 tons of salt, 2,000,000 tons by
1974. Because salt is such a low-priced commodity,


explains Mr. Lopez, who Leslie Salt brought out
of retirement to get the W.A. venture off the ground,
it has to have a set of circumstances making the
harvesting and shipping of it an economical
proposition. As far as Leslie Salt is concerned, the
tidal flats north of Port Hedland and the develop-
ment of the port itself as primarily a great iron-ore
loading base, present ideal circumstances. The
company has contributed $1 million to helping
improve Port Hedland’s wharf facilities. It will build
40 homes for its workers and has already built miles
of access roads. Although it is the sun’s harsh heat
which plays the major role in producing solar salt,
a project such as Leslie’s involves preparing
thousands of acres of land into which seawater is
pumped, laying many miles of plastic-lined pipes to
allow the salt brine to develop in a several-stage
process, and finally harvesting the salt by mechanised
methods. Besides the Shark Bay, Dampier, and Port
Hedland project, two other solar salt projects are
mooted for W.A., one in Exmouth Gulf, another at
Lafe Lefroy on the eastern goldfields. A third
proposal involves starting a potash extraction
industry on 800-square-mile Lake McLeod, near
Carnarvon. Texada Mines Ltd., of Canada, under
an agreement with the W.A. Government, is halfway
through a two-year research program which could
result in this site producing 240,000 tons of potash
fertiliser a year—more than enough for present
Australian demands.
AN ISLAND OF
BACHELORS
BARROW ISLAND, Australia’s largest commercial
oilfield, 60 miles north-east of Onslow, is sometimes
referred to as an island of lonely bachelors. This is
not strictly true. Living among the 290 men on
Barrow is one woman, blonde Mrs. Mary Kirkham,
wife of a cook at the camp of one of the four drilling
contractors. But you hardly notice her. She sticks
close to the camp, and elsewhere the oilfield boys
are so busy ten hours’ toil a day, seven days a
week that many who have been on Barrow for
months haven’t yet seen her. Anyhow, since 50
percent of the Barrow men are married, they may
be lonely but they are not bachelors, and in any
case everyone there, single or married, gets to Perth
regularly. Western Australian Petroleum Pty. Ltd.
(WAPET), the oilfield’s operator, sends its men
away from the island one week in every three. Meri
working for the drilling, catering, and construction
contractors are given one week’s leave air fares
paid both ways —to Perth after every seven weeks’
work. So letting off pressure is as regulated for the
workers on Barrow as for the oil wells they drill and
tap. In fact, human relations on Barrow have gone
as smoothly as its flow of oil. Accommodation is in
air-conditioned huts; the food is free and excellent.
There is some heavy drinking, but brawling and
gambling are taboo. Since January last year only
31 men have been ordered off the island and regular
turnover of workers is not anywhere near the high
rate of the iron-ore fields. The tempo of activity on
Barrow is beginning to slacken a little as develop-
ment of the oilfield nears its highpoint. So far more
than 200 of the 240 scheduled wells have been
drilled, and with new ones coming on at the rate
of 12 a month the total should be reached within
the next few months. Barrow production is now at
the rate of 25,000 barrels a day (already more than
four million barrels have been shipped out) and a
peak flow of 30,000 barrels a day is expected in the
first quarter of this year. The field, which contains
at least 114 million barrels of recoverable oil, is
thought to have a life of about 30 years.
There is on Barrow a look of at least semi-
permanency. The island, about 17 miles long, seven
miles wide at its widest point, is covered with a
network of 250 miles of road. Almost every vehicle is
equipped with two-way radio. MMA Friendships
land on the island’s airstrip twice a week, bringing
in perishable goods, and there is a regular charter-
plane link with the mainland. Barrow’s greatest
drawback are the outflung reefs which surround it,
with the result that ships of the W.A. Shipping
Service have to anchor four miles offshore, and heavy
equipment is ferried inshore by barge. Dominating
Barrow’s hilly skyline are three massive storage tanks,
each of 200,000-barrel storage capacity, and with
floating roofs to stop evaporation. A fourth tank is
nearly finished, and work is well ahead on a new
main campsite. Apart from its natural wildlife of
wallabies, bandicoots, and tiger snakes, Barrow’s
most striking feature is a six-mile-long pipeline which
feeds Barrow oil to tankers, which, because of the
reefs, cannot come closer to the shore. Skindivers
who maintain this pipeline face up every day to an
assortment of undersea hazards -—2 O ft sharks, giant
gropers, stonefish, venomous sea snakes. So far not
a man has been lost in the water.
Two men run Barrow. One is an American, Bob
Allen, who is a production wizard. The other is an
Australian, Bevan Cook, 36, who supervises the
drilling. Cook was once a clerk at Swan Breweries in
Perth. He joined WAPET in the 19505, when the
first exhilarating but non-commercial oil strikes were
made at Rough Range on the mainland close to
Barrow. From a “roughneck” he has risen to the
top fast; the company plans to send him soon to
the University of Texas for further technical training,
then spend a time on the oilfields of Texas. Cook, an
easy-going bachelor with a penchant for fast cars,
typifies the new breed of Australian technocrat to be
found these days in the West. He explains that
WAPET refuses to rest on the laurels of Barrow
even though its production will give back to the


company a fair chunk of the SIOO million it has
spent so far probing for oil in the West. The search
for new fields goes on tirelessly. Until recently the
probe was northward; up to the Monte Bello islands,
scene of Britain’s A-bomb tests in the ’fifties. No oil!
Now the exploration is to the south, with more
hopeful signs. Last year Wx\PET again struck oil,
this time at Pascoe Island, six miles south of Barrow.
Geologists consider it most likely that this is a con-
tinuation of the Barrow oil-bearing structure, and
following detailed seismic mapping intensive offshore
drilling will begin once the cyclone season ends
and as soon as a jack-up type drilling rig, built in
Texas, is towed in from across the Pacific. Of sl7
million WAPET will spend this year, $1 1 million will
be on drilling operations. Although WAPET is the
dominant oil-seeker in the West, 11 other companies
hold leases of thousands of square miles over the
State; for example, Arco Ltd. is bringing out from
Japan a $lO million rig for offshore drilling in the
Bonaparate Gulf, north of Wyndham, and Burmah
Oil Co. (Australia) is spending $2 million on
offshore drilling 70 miles from Port Sampson. The
major oil strikes in the Bass Strait (Vic.) Kingfish
field haven’t destroyed the enthusiasm of the oil-
seekers in the West. Is the oil from Barrow good
quality? “Bloody oath,” enthuses Bevan Cook,
holding up a bottle of the light greenish crude to the
light for us to see. “Take this out of the ground,
separate the sand, and we can put it straight into
the diesels driving the generators here and it goes
like a charm.”
A TOWN CALLED
EXMOUTH
IN THE LOUNGE BAR of the Pot Shot Inn, bottles
of bourbon and rye and packets of Stateside cigars
clutter shelves. Accents of drinkers range from nasal
Aussie to harsh Brooklyn and drawled Deep South.
Almost everybody has an identity card, with picture,
clipped to shirt pocket. It is 9 p.m., and a U.S.
Navy shore-patrolman, wearing whites and twirling
a nightstick, comes into the bar. It’s a peaceful
grogging session, so he saunters out. This is Exmouth,
even for the fast changing north-west, an unusual
town. Like many towns up here, it is totally new, an
upthrust of flat concrete buildings from the red
dust over which, until a few years back, only mobs
of ’roos or a solitary grazier roamed. But, unlike the
other new places, Exmouth doesn’t owe its birth to
mineral exploitation or agricultural expansion. It was
built for one reason: to service the U.S. Navy’s giant
radio communications base on the tip of North West
Cape. The base was opened last September, and now
the Exmouth community numbers 3000 700 of
them Americans, mostly Navy men, about 50
civilians, and the wives and kids of married
personnel. At Exmouth the American presence is
strikingly evident, from the accents in the streets to
the numbers of lefthand-drive autos; much more so
than at Carnarvon, to the south, where Americans
and Australians jointly operate a space-tracking
station in the Apollo man-on-moon program, but
where the peak staff numbers only 100. Exmouth
township itself is on Commonwealth land; the U.S.
base, eight miles away, is on 18,000 acres of Crown
land leased to the U.S. Government.
Officially Exmouth is an integrated town.
American and Australian families live side by side,
they share the town’s swimming-pool, lawn bowls
green, drive-in theatre, dirt racetrack, and their
youngsters go to the same school. But from the
Australian viewpoint there are a few gripes. The
Americans’ houses are air-conditioned, the
Australians’ have only fans. In a place where living
costs are high (beer, 55 cents a bottle), the
Americans have access to the PX store on the base,
the Australians don’t (officially). Still, things are
going just fine in social relations at Exmouth; 12
Americans have already married local lasses, the
Yanks play Aussie Rules and teach Australians the
rudiments of baseball. And there are some noisy
get-togethers at the new RSL club in Exmouth,
named after World War II fighter ace “Bluey”
Truscott, who died when his plane crashed into
Exmouth Gulf in the days when Learmonth airstrip,
20 miles to the south, was a fighter base. “There’s
no little America here,” says Colonel J. K. Murdoch,
onetime Australian Army man who is the area’s
Civil Administrator, a joint Commonwealth-State
appointee who rules the local shire council for
good measure. Colonel Murdoch runs a tight little
town, but says his greatest headaches occur at this
time of the year, getting due warning of approaching
cyclones and persuading everyone to batten-down
properly. Colonel Murdoch works hand-in-hand with
the base commander, Captain Robert Friedman,
whose executive officer, Commander J. A.
Grantham, jun., says, “We get less trouble here than
with a military establishment in a full American
community maybe we’re more sensitive to what;
trouble could arise, so we tread a mite more
carefully." More than 300 Australians are employed
on the U.S. base as radio technicians, security guards,
clerks, storemen, laborers, and there are 200 more
jobs coming up. Even though 285 houses have been
built (rent, $17.80 a week), most of the people who
trek the 863 miles from Perth for Exmouth boom
jobs prefer to live in caravans which they can leave
in one of the town’s caravan parks for $ll a fort-

night, including power. With many of the migrants
to Exmouth it’s the same old story found right
throughout the north —get a big-paying job, stash
the dough in the bank, then move on!
Australians are responsible for the perimeter
security of the Exmouth area, but it’s not as strict
as the Americans impose around the base proper.
Duplicate passes, Australian and American, are
necessary to get beyond the high-wire fence, and
even then there are certain “sensitive” facilities
where only VIPs can gain admission. For example,
even if escorted by a U.S. Navy man there are a few
obstacles to getting inside the great concrete block-
house underneath the station’s dominant feature, the
1271 ft. Tower Zero, which houses the massive VLF
transmitter. At the doorway an electronic voice asks
you your business, and only if the answer is satis-
factory does the thick glass door slide automatically
aside. With its sister base at Maine in the U.S., the
radio station is the most powerful known transmitter
in the world. It can send Morse signals to any part
of the globe. These signals, being of very low
frequency, follow closely the curvature of the earth
and, in fact, penetrate it, making them capable of
reception by Polaris submarines beneath the ocean
surface. However, except for the occasional cyclone
warning, life at Exmouth is pretty routine. Ask the
Americans how they feel about their 18-month to
two-year posting there, and you get a standard
answer Well, it isn’t exactly paradise, but there
are plenty of worse spots where an American service-
man can be stationed these days. The Aussies, say
the Americans, make life bearable with their
hospitality and friendliness. Ask the Australians
about the fate of Exmouth should the U.S. base there
ever close, and they, too, have a standard reply: The
North West Cape is one of the country’s potentially
best tourist spots. Except for mid-summer, the
climate is ideal, the fishing superb, the local gorge
scenery overwhelming, and because the Cape is the
part of the Australian mainland nearest to the
continental shelf, its beaches yield large, beautiful
sea shells.
RICHES FROM
THE SEAS
FOR YEARS the succulent crayfish of Western
Australia have been pleasing foreign palates and
bolstering the State’s income. Exports of crayfish,
mainly to the U.S. and Asia, earn W.A. more than
sl3 million a year. Now a new era in the W.A.
fishing industry is unfolding; prawning looks like
becoming an even greater money-spinner and there
are good prospects of vast quantities of tuna being
caught and processed there. Money, research, know-
how these are being applied to the rapidly
expanding fishing industry, with emphasis being
switched from southern waters to the warmer ones
of the north-west. The only hitch is shortage of
labor; operators in the new fishing grounds have to
compete for workers with the big-money-paying
exploiters in the booming mineral fields. For the
moment the boom is in prawns; with the total haul
3.9 million lb. in 1966-67 doubling annually.
Keen advocates of an expansion of the fishing
industry are the Kailis family; George Kailis, the
father, was once a Greek fisherman off an island near
Turkey who came to Australia in the ’twenties, was a
diver at Darwin and a railway-sleeper cutter before
opening a small fish-peddling business in West Perth.
With his sons, Theo and Michael, he built up a
crayfish-processing business worth $500,000 before
selling it out to the giant Ross group, of Grimsby,
England, with Theo as managing director. The
Kailis brothers have now launched out into a big-
prawning enterprise at Exmouth Gulf. They believe
there could be a prawn fishery extending the full
length of Australia’s northern coastline from
Carnarvon to Cape York. They say that unless local
enterprises exploit these waters, someone else will.
Geraldton and Carnarvon also have sizable prawning
industries, and catches are becoming so great that
shore freezing and processing facilities are sometimes
unable to handle all of them.
The line of thinking now is that larger vessels,
able to stay at sea longer, and in all weathers, and
with on-the-spot freezing equipment, must more and
more come into operation. Japanese operators, whose
country is a wide open market for quality prawns,
are eager to join new ventures, but recent discussions
between the W.A. Government and the Common-
wealth have resulted in agreement that use of foreign
vessels and crews in joint ventures must be tem-
porary, and must provide for the replacement of
these within five years. At the height of the .prawning
season, so prolific are the yields that at Exmouth
Gulf it is not uncommon for one boat to net 10001 b.
of prawns in a single night. A shot-in-the-arm for
the fishing industry is the recent decision by Dilling-
ham Shipyards, which already has built 70 vessels
at its yards in North Fremantle, to spend $500,000
within five years on new shipyards at Geraldton.
Employing more than 150 workers, the Geraldton
yards will soon be building steel fishing vessels of
up to 300 tons. In the West, authorities forecast
that prawning will eventually overtake crayfishing
as the State’s most important fishing industry. They
also believe that one day tuna will possibly be even
more important than prawns and crayfish together.
Aerial surveys by W.A. Department of Fisheries
experts and CSIRO scientists show extensive stocks
of tuna in the waters from Carnarvon to Derby.
So far it has been Japanese vessels which have
extensively fished these tuna miles offshore; now
Western Australians themselves are eager to acquire
the right type of deep-sea boats and shore-based


canning factories to capture a lion’s share of the
increasing world market for tuna. Additionally, there
is talk of exploiting the great numbers of green,
edible turtles which abound in the warm waters of
the northern coastline. They, too, offer potential
lucrative exports to Asia. This accelerating move
to win more wealth from the seas is yet another
segment in the exciting pattern of the West’s
development.
THE MIRACLE OF
ESPERANCE
THE ESPERANCE PLAIN at this time of the year
is a drab place, enlivened only by the spectacular
coastline of this south-east segment of Western Aus-
tralia. For years this has been the summer play-
ground of the mining people, who drive the 250
miles from Kalgoorlie to cool off on the fine beaches
and to fish from the massive granite rocks. But until
the past few years the plain has simply been a boring
sight, either to the car driver or the plane passenger.
Today from the air it shows up as a giant checker-
board of sepia and bone colors, broken up with
putty-toned lines of cleared land and the deep khaki
of the Australian scrub in summer. With the miracle
of spring the checkerboard changes its colors. What
was considered only wasteland a few years ago comes
alive with the deep greens of clovers, the pale greens
of cereals. And the putty-colored sandplain takes
on a richer hue each year, as fertilisers and clovers
do their cumulative work. To the summer holiday-
makers Esperance is still just a coastal hamlet,
even though its population has increased sixfold in
the past eight years. But to farmers Esperance is a
vast and exciting area a great T-shaped slab of
sandplain underlaid with clay, extending in a 25-
mile-wide swathe from the rabbit-proof fence, 95
miles west of the town, to 120 miles east of Esper-
ance; the T’s downstroke goes inland 68 miles to
Salmon Gums. This transition from wasteland to
productive farmland has been accomplished by home-
bred technology, fortified by some American finance
. . . but far more by American-scale thinking and
publicity.
Esperance, anyhow, would have been developed
in time with the application of knowledge about
trace elements, fertilisers, and subterranean clovers,
which Western Australians have developed. The
potential of this knowledge, in this situation, was first
exploited on a grand scale by American investor Mr.
Allen Chase, who, in 1954, was granted rights to
develop 1,500,000 acres of the area. His scheme
failed mainly because his borrowed knowledge was
not properly applied. His group tried to accelerate
the two-year build-up needed to enrich the sandplain.
The Chase syndicate was followed by the American-
run Esperance Land Development Company, who
have sold 110 blocks of about 2000 acres each
an economic unit for two families in this com-
paratively intensive-farming area. Their scheme
develops the land one-third of the way to produc-
tivity, selling half and retaining the rest under
managership. Those who have taken up “American-
ised” land maintain that at least $20,000 capital is
needed, although the gossips in the pubs tell of men
coming in with SIOOO and a tractor and making a
go of it. And despite the obvious scope for criticism
of Amercans using Australian ideas to make money
on Australian land, and selling it mainly to Aus-
tralians, Esperance people generally acknowledge
that, without the publicity which followed people
like U.S. TV personality Art Linkletter taking up
big landholdings, Esperance would never have thrived
as it has. It was this kind of publicity that first
attracted 39-year-old Hugh Burchard from his prop-
erty in Tantanoola, South Australia, in 1964. A type
of farmer who spends his spare time painting his
fences white, Burchard has built up the land’s value
since then from about sl2 an acre to more than S4O
making his property worth well over $140,000.
Once a week he commutes the 40 miles to Esperance,.
where his wife and four daughters live. This year
he hopes to build a home on the property, indicative
of the priorities in an area where potential profit is
ploughed back as long as possible. John Brown got
his land the other way through a conditional
purchase agreement with the State Government.
These conditions are that a set development rate be
carried out; so far only three properties have been
forfeited for failure to comply with the conditions.
John Brown is 44, with greying hair and blue eyes
that contrast vividly with the Redskin tan he has
acquired in his years as a farmer and from five years
in the AIF, in the Middle East and New Guinea.
After the war he took up a soldier-settlement block
at Finley, New South Wales, working within an irri-
gation scheme. One year the water supply was
restricted, and as he says, “I realised that one bad
year like that in five, and all my profit was down
the drain.” So he went westward on a holiday, and
discovered Esperance.
When Brown arrived seven years ago, about four-
fifths of Esperance farmers were from outside
Western Australia, attracted by stories of the low
cost of land. Now the proportion is about two-thirds.
“They’re more or less giving you the dirt for
nothing,” Brown concedes. But he has to dig deep
into his pocket to make the dirt start to pay. He has
borrowed $32,000 from the Commonwealth Develop-
ment Bank, and up to SIO,OOO from stock firms to
develop his 1500 acres, which he is paying off as a
soldier settler over 30 years at 65 cents an acre. Esper-
ance, as men like Hugh Burchard and John Brown
will tell you, is all right. Esperance is not the Pilbara.
But, like the Pilbara, it is proving what excitement
can be generated when natural resources, technology,
capital, and publicity are stirred vigorously with a


dash of vision. If Esperance is the centrepiece of rural
development in the West, then at least all over the
State’s agricultural region the same pattern of go-
aheadness is being repeated. New land is being opened
up at the rate of one million acres a year. This year,
with a third successive above 100-million-bushel
crop, Western Australia is second only to New South
Wales as a wheat producer. With 27-| million sheep,
it will soon be the second most prolific wool producer.
Cattle numbers are also rising rapidly, and in the
Kimberleys the main beef area pastoralists are
enjoying unprecedented prices because of healthy
export markets for lean beef. Then there is the
thriving timber industry, with the fine hardwoods of
the karri and jarrah forests as keenly in demand as
ever. All this, and the minerals boom, too.
MAGNETS FOR
TOURISTS
ONCE THEY CAME to see the wildflowers, to relax
at Rottnest Island, or to test Perth’s claim to being
sunniest capital. Now it’s the new sights,
the booming iron-ore towns, the rocket-tracking
station, the Ord scheme, the flowering desert miracle
at Esperance, which are the magnets luring tourists
to the West. Tourism now earns Western Australia
about $3O million a year, and after the petroleum
industry is the biggest money-earner from the Eastern
States. Because of the publicity given to big mining
ventures, tourists are being attracted to the north-
west from all parts of Australia. Apart from seeing
frontiers pushed back, they enjoy scenery described
by travel experts as equal to the best in Australia.
The rash of development which is fast spreading all
over the face of Western Australia is being accom-
panied by improvement of travel facilities and an
up-grading of accommodation. Even in new towns
like Dampier and Tom Price, and in old ones under-
going a terrific transformation, such as Port Hed-
land, it is now possible to stay in motels at least
equal in standards to the very best in capital cities.
Kununurra, the town on the Ord, has become one
of the State’s busiest winter holiday resorts, and as
a base for power-boating along the Ord, or taking
in the Kimberley’s scenic grandeur, this year is
expected to have more than 5000 visitors.
This is not to say, of course, that hotels in many
of the north’s towns and ports don’t still offer fairly
rough-and-tumble accommodation, and the many
thousands of miles of roads in the north still unsealed
make for uncomfortable driving. Operators of safari-
type tours call on passengers to help out with some
of the camp chores, and in the more remote spots
provide tents for sleeping. Yet this hasn’t prevented
W.A. from doubling, over the past decade, its intake
of visitors from the Eastern States, and attracting
growing numbers of overseas tourists. The influx from
the East has been helped by five-hour jetliner flights
from Sydney and Melbourne with return fares,
economy class, of $223.20. W.A.’s tourist planners
are looking forward to the sealing of the Eyre High-
way to the South Australian border (to be completed
by September, 1969) and the opening of the round-
Australia standard gauge railway, early in 1969, to
further stimulate tourist traffic from the East. Perth
itself still lacks a first-class international hotel, but a
$9 million hotel-motel building program involving
five projects is underway and will provide 750 extra
beds in a city where accommodation is often over-
taxed. A system of grading W.A. hotels has been
introduced, and a proliferation of good restaurants
and nightclubs is enlivening the city’s nightlife.
Behind the W.A. Tourist Development Authority’s
current drive to attract many visitors is a hidden
motive; if they see first-hand as much as possible of
the march of the State, they may want to come back
and stay for good.
NICKEL—THE
NEW TREASURE
THE GOLD RUSH of the 1890 s made Kalgoorlie;
today’s nickel rush is reshaping and revitalising this
region. The gold miners came individually to fossick
for gold, living in humpies. The nickel explorers are
giant corporations, coming with millions of dollars
behind them, setting up their fossickers in air-con-
ditioned caravans and later in air-conditoned towns.
Kambalda, 35 miles south-south-east of Kalgoorlie,
is the first of these towns. It is just over two years
since the first significant find of nickel sulphide ore
was made near Lake Lefroy, the big saltpan just
south of Kambalda. But the spadework was done so-
effectively that 10 days short of two years after this
first discovery, Western Mining Corporation com-
mitted itself to a $45 million investment in a nickel
refinery, to be built near Fremantle, on the strength
of what had been found. Normally nickel is mined,
crushed and treated, concentrated, smelted, and then
refined. The plan now is to sidestep the smelter stage
for the time being, going directly from concentrates
to pure metal, thus trimming many months from the
original timetable. There is good reason for this rush
to production. Nickel is a dull silver-colored metal
used mainly in stainless steel, and increasingly for
nickel plating and steel alloys. As world living stan-
dards rise, the uses for nickel snowball. The rush is
to take advantage of a freak hiatus between world
supply and demand, then to become established
firmly in this growing market. Western Mining
Corporation has created tremendous interest among
nickel speculators because it is the only company that
has started mining. But dozens of other companies
and small groups or even individuals are combing the
ground in a huge arc from Norseman to Wiluna
a distance of almost 500 miles in the hunt for
nickel. Any doubts about earlier forecasts that


possibly a nickel of deposit of world magnitude exists
in this region of the West were swept aside recently
when WMC, announcing the biggest share issue in
Australian company history to finance its nickel
refinery, revealed that its own proved reserves of ore
at Kambalda were riow 9.3 million tons averaging 3.8
percent nickel double the quantity of previously
announced reserves.
The original sample that sparked off the Kam-
balda rush was picked up off the ground by pros-
pector John Morgan, of Boulder, and George Cow-
cill, a farmer from South Quairading. The find
earned them $50,000 reward from WMC, which after
tests realised it had a discoverey of major importance.
Western Mining Corporation was set up in the 1930 s
as a mine manager and financier, tied almost exclu-
sively to gold until moving with two American
partners into the first, comparatively small, Western
Australian iron-ore export undertaking at Koola-
nooka, with shipments of ore to Japan through the
port of Geraldton and into the mining of bauxite
for alumina with the Alcoa group. During the iron-
ore development, geologists noted similarities in the
structures of Western Australian and Canadian rock
formations. And this coincided with rediscovery of
nickel traces around Kalgoorlie. With hindsight, it is
easy to say that the company was dead right in
going ahead to explore for nickel. But it had already
diversified out of its traditional avenues into bauxite
and iron ore, and it took a great deal of courage for
Sir (then Mr.) Lindesay Clark to lead his company
off on this expensive new tangent. The homework
Western Mining had been doing around Kalgoorlie
in the gold-mining years has paid off with a bonanza.
They have at least a two-year start on many of their
rivals, some of them considerably bigger concerns,
attracted by the new boom. One estimate is that
WMC’s nickel-ore reserves alone have a gross value
of more than S7OO million. Another estimate is that
when other nickel fields in the West are developed,
exports of nickel will, within 25 years, reach the
staggering sum of $2600 million. Although still
overshadowed by the State’s huge iron-ore develop-
ments, nickel is rapidly emerging as very much the
West’s new treasure.
While the impact of this on the national economy
is greatly stimulating, for the Kalgoorlie region it is
of utmost significance. There is less glitter in gold
these days, as income from this metal, hamstrung
by the twin bogy of fixed price and rising costs, is
steadily dwindling away. The Kalgoorlie area still
provides 80 percent of Australia’s gold output, but
its long-term outlook remains bleak. In fact, there
had been a suggestion that the only hope for Kal-
goorlie was to make it another Las Vegas, with an
open season for gambling in one town. But the nickel
boom has breathed fresh life into the area. The
Kambalda find alone is expected to create a popu-
lation of 2500 within the next five years, and any
further discoveries are bound to accelerate this trend.
Since the nickel rush the old buildings of gold rush
days have had paint slapped on them for the first
time in years, land values have steadied, and there is
a new spring in Kalgoorlie’s step.
THE GREAT
AWAKENING
THE NEW FRONTIER. The Big State on the
Move. The Everything Rush. The Great Awakening .
W.A. Means Business ... If originality is lacking in
the slogans that W.A. Government PR men churn out
to extol their State, they’re certainly not short on
enthusiasm. “The Cinderella status of Western Aus-
tralia,” says Charles Court, “belongs to the past,
and in our drive to maturity we’re now slipping into
top gear. I don’t think W.A.’s economic miracle has
been a seven-year wonder I think the real miracle
has yet to come. Only two things can halt us.
Complacency for one; if we sit back smugly with
what we’ve achieved instead of pressing ahead with
even bigger plans which should come to fruition in
the 1980 s. Second, lack of people. Even in this push-
button age you’ve got to have people to install
the buttons and others who know when to press
them.” If at the moment W.A. lacks enough people,
it certainly has no shortage of space for many more
to settle there. Government agriculturalists say that
the West still has at least 10 million acres (with an
average rainfall of more than 11 in.) available for
new farms.
Nor does the State lack initiative in letting the
rest of Australia and the world know of its progress
and potentialities. Court’s department, for example,
is about to establish in Sydney an information office;
it plans to put a man into East Asia soon and perhaps
another in South-east Asia. The overall policy of
the W.A. Government is to convert the State’s
geographical disadvantage—its comparative isolation
from the rest of the nation—into a strong selling
point for a vigorous export drive. The sort of facts
Court and his colleagues use in mounting a trade
assault on Asia is that Djakarta is closer to Fremantle
than is Sydney.
In the West today, the same buoyant confidence
you encounter in Government offices and business
boardrooms is reflected in the community as a whole.
Wherever you go, to the Ord, to Pilbara, to Esper-
ance, in Perth itself, there is among all the people
the same current of enthusiasm, the same anything-
you-in-the-East-can-do-we-can-do-better cockiness.
To be a Western Australian these days is to feel you
stand even a fraction taller than ten feet.

Japan is aiding Australian industry
What she buys is
good for Australia
but so is what
she sells
JETRO (Japan External Trade
Organisation), through Japan Trade
Centre, Sydney, contributes in this and
the following three pages some com-
ments, which, it says, are suggested by
the feature on Western Australia.
The underlying fact in any examina-
tion of the boom in Western Australia
is that it has come about almost wholly
because of present and future require-
ments of the Japanese steel industry,
the world’s third greatest.
Japan, as well as being the catalyst
in the new emergence of the West, has
become top customer of Australia at
large and is likely to remain so. It would
be unnatural to expect her to be con-
tent with a one-way deal in trade bene-
fits. She wants to sell where she buys.
Is this going to mean an influx that
will place limits on the growth of Aus-
tralia’s own industries? The answer is
that there will be neither influx nor
curtailment.
Japan certainly wants to sell more
here. The balance in the trade of the
two countries is at present almost two
to one against Japan and the margin
could widen appreciably as imports of
Australian minerals, particularly iron
ore, get into their stride. But any idea
of Japan’s holding this country in thrall
because of her rich purchases is as out-
moded as the old wool-to-Japan, tex-
tiles-and-sundries-to Australia routine.
While many of Japan’s exports to
Australia are competitive, the develop-
ment of capital equipment installations,
in which use is made of Japanese
material and Japanese technology, but
with increasing, deliberately planned
Australian participation, is a fascinating
chapter in the altogether remarkable
story of the trade and economic rela-
tionship of these two countries in
recent times.
With the onset of the great Depres-
sion of the ’thirties the Australian
Government of the day brought out a
representative of the Bank of England
to advise it; and in general terms his
advice, fortunately not adopted, was
that Australia should abandon her
manufacturing ambitions and become
simply an agricultural country, getting
manufactured products from outside in
exchange for raw materials and food-
stuffs.
At the BHP plant in Newcastle an example of the use of Japanese capital equip-
ment by Australian industry is this 50-ton B.O.S. furnace. Yawata Iron and Steel
Co. installed it in March, 1967
A respected elderly Japanese indus-
trialist said much the same thing last
month at a seminar in Melbourne (and
it is also quite recently that a prominent
Australian expressed a kindred view).
But the opinion of the visiting indus-
trialist is far removed from the con-
sensus.
Japanese exporters are unanimous in
looking for a wider share of the Aus-
tralian market, but not only as a quid
pro quo. They believe, for instance,
that Australia itself would benefit from
a bigger intake of Japanese heavy
machinery; and that, while there are
other factors, there would be a bigger
intake if the quality of this machinery
were better known in Australia.
The clinching argument for this, of
course, is that the so-called miracle of
Japan’s industrial renaissance has been
achieved by the use of this very
machinery. If severe internal competi-
tion had not brought to such a pitch
of efficiency the industrial machinery
in use at the plants, Japan’s arrival as
number three steel producer (or
earlier as number five and number
four) could not have occurred.
It is also the general belief of
Japanese industrialists interested in the
Australian market that it will be a
better market if its own secondary
industries develop, and better still if
that development reaches the stage
where both two countries can exchange
manufactured goods, as to some extent
has happened already. There are 48
Japanese companies directly represented
in Australia, and from none of them
will you hear any denial of the Aus-
tralian right and necessity to protect
local production.
In addition, the keenness of Japanese
businessmen for participation in joint
ventures is well known. Invariably they
are ventures in which the Australian
interest is predominant, invariably they
have succeeded; and their number
should increase after conclusion of cur-
rent negotiations for a double taxation
agreement on the lines of similar agree-
ments which Australia now has with
every other major country except the
U.S.S.R.
The history of installations of
Japanese turbines in Australia goes,
back quite a long way now, but the
first to appear in Queensland are in
process of installation.
These are two 30 mw turbine genera-
tors for Stage Two of the Collinsville
Power Station, which will double the
output of the station. Mitsubishi (Aust.)
Pty. Ltd. has the contract for this from
the Northern Electric Authority of
Queensland but Mitsubishi will do
only half the work. The other half of


the plant is being made and assembled
by local firms.
Occasionally this it not possible. The
stockbridge for BHP’s No. 2 blast furn-
ace at Whyalla was needed so urgently
that there was no time for local fabrica-
tion. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy In-
dustries Ltd. carried out the whole of
the work in Japan for this reason.
Japan’s major exports to Australia,
as to other countries, extend beyond
physical commodities. There is more
and more demand for her technologies.
In Australia, the spectacular instance
of this —also of direct co-operation with
local industry—is the construction of
the 50,000-ton ore-carrier Darling
River, the largest ship ever to be built
in this country. She has been carrying
ore from Western Australia to the steel
centres of New South Wales since her
maiden voyage in mid-1966.
The Darling River was built at
Whyalla dockyard by a combined team
of Australian and Japanese technicians.
Although European shipyards are
now challenging her long-sustained
supremacy, Japan has been the world’s
leading shipbuilder for 12 years. The
simple reason for this was the
superiority of revolutionary techniques
evolved by Japanese designers, ship-
wrights, and engineers. It ended once
and for all the comfortable assumption
that Japan owed any industrial advance
it made to cheap labor —especially in
an industry where labor was dear, and
has continued to be dear and increas-
ingly short.
The collaboration of Japanese tech-
nicians brought up in this school and
the Australians at Whyalla shipyard,
which is to continue, is acknowledged
to have resulted in the Darling River
being built in half the time that would
normally have been taken.
One of the spectacular joint ventures
is the triple Australian-U.S.-Japanese
consortium of Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui
Pty. Ltd., which is operating the open-
face coalfield at Moura, Queensland,
under a contract to supply 29 million
tons to Japanese steel mills over ten
years.
To cope with the output the Queens-
land Government is building a $2O
million 112-mile railway from Moura
to the port of Gladstone to provide a
shorter, more direct route between mine
and port, enabling coal to be trans-
ported at the rate of 33 million tons a
year.
The present line extends over 198
miles, which is handling other heavy
traffic, and the coal is carried in 62-ton
wagons, which (incidentally) were made
in Japan.
On his recent visit to Australia, Mr.
Kimitaka Murakami, Vice-President of
JETRO, held a Press conference in
Melbourne, following which some news-
papers reported him as having
“attacked” the Australian tariff. In fact,
Mr. Murakami was most insistent that
he recognised a protective tariff to be
necessary and that in any event this
was an internal matter.
What Mr. Murakami did say—and
Mitsubishi (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. will install ten of these 133 MVA transformers at
Newcastle Power Substation
The largest transformers in the Southern Hemisphere, at Munmorah Power
Station, New South Wales, are another Mitsubishi installation
this without offering any criticism—was
that Japanese capital goods had to cross
a barrier of 50 percent (with some
exceptions under by-laws) compared
with a range of up to 7.5 percent for
similar British goods.
While suggesting that the rate was
“rather high,” Mr. Murakami added:
“Tariffs are your business, not ours. We
can only express a hope. We have to
adapt.”
This is the outlook of responsible
Japanese trade leaders resident in Aus-
tralia.
Two who have expressed interesting
and almost identical views on this are
Mr. Akitake Miura, Managing Director
of Mitsubishi (Aust.) Pty. Ltd.; and
Mr. Shoji Yoshida, Managing Director
of Nissho Co. (Aust.) Pty. Ltd.
(Mr. Yoshida is also Chairman of
the Machinery Division of the Japan
Chamber of Commerce.)
Mr. Miura said the by-law provis-
ions of the tariff looked after goods
in categories not manufactured in Aus-
tralia, and there were many of these,
“Australia is a country of great natural
resources, and everything possible
should be done to develop these re-
sources,” he added. “It is in our interest,.
as well as in Australia’s interest, that
these resources, and Australia herself^
should be developed to the maximum.
There are many ways in which we can
help, and I would like to think that all
possible facilities be given for us to help
each-other.
“Japan is the most industrialised
country in the Far East (in this office


Shifting 2000 tons of ore per hour this stacker-reclaimer, at Whyalla, S.A., was designed and made by Ishikawajima-Harima
Heavy Industries but it has many Australian components
we always add that Mitsubishi is the
most industrialised group in Japan) and
we want to co-operate all we can.
“I hope that there will always be
reasonable facilities for obtaining from
Japan the machinery and other capital
equipment that will serve this purpose,
either by directly importing it or
arranging for partial or complete manu-
facture locally under joint venture.
“I sometimes think that any tardiness
over importing more capital equipment
from Japan is due not so much to tariff
difficulties as to lack of knowledge on
the part of Australia about Japanese
machinery. I am sure many more busi-
nessmen and technicians would be keen
to get it here if they were aware of its
quality.
“I think more of the key people in
Australia should go to Japan and look
at what we have for them. There is no
difficulty in haying our machinery
tailored to individual requirements.
Don’t forget, we use Japanese machinery
ourselves—that is what has put us
where we are!”
He expressed these views on the eve
of his departure for Tasmania, where
he attended the three-day opening cere-
monies this week of the Savage River
Mine, where Mitsubishi is in partner-
ship with Picklands Mather, of the
U.S.A.
Another project on his slate at the
moment is the installation of a recti-
former at the Comalco Bell Bay plant,
which will increase the capacity of the
plant by 50 percent. (A rectiformer is
a result of Mitsubishi research in sili-
con rectifier technology, which has both
simplified and improved rectifier sub-
stations, conventionally designed with
switchgear, transformers, and rectifiers
which call for large buildings and ex-
pensive wiring work. It is hailed as
having brought a new era to power con-
version equipment.)
There is also a $4 million contract
for six water generators for the Tumut
Power Station, the largest to be in-
stalled by the Snowy Mountains
Authority. »
Mr/ Yoshida’s organisation, Nissho,
is one of the typical large-scale
Japanese trading companies. In the one
huge office are the wool experts, the
machinery experts, and the ship ex-
perts. Some idea of the ramifications is
that they range from acting for the
.gigantic Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries (who helped remember
to build Australia’s biggest ship)
to the procedures of collecting Western
Australian prawns for the gourmets of
Japan.
(Nissho is interested not only in
ships, but in all forms of marine equip-
ment. Only last month the parent office
got an order, the first ever received by
Japan from the U.K., for the first of a
series of marine equipment orders for
Scott’s Shipbuilding and Engineering
Co., Greenock—a crane and a dock.
Nissho is already sending marine equip-
ment to Western Germany.)
Another IHI installation at Whyalla
is this stockbridge


Mr. Yoshida is in full agreement with
Mr. Miura —especially on the need for
more personal visits to Japan by key
Australians.
“It is certainly in our interests, and
in the interests of the market, that we
make an effort to expand our exports
of heavy machinery and chemicals,”
said Mr. Yoshida. \
“As to the tariff, my attitude is, ‘wait
and see.’ Getting Australians to see our
plants and our production at first-hand
is really important.
“Not enough of the top technicians
are going there. Most of them go to
Europe and America. They could take
in Japan with little extra trouble, and
they would find it at least equally
rewarding.”
Mr. Eizo Mekata, Director and
General Manager, in Melbourne, of
Mitsui and Co. (Aust.) Pty. Ltd., shares
with the other Japanese business
leaders the combination of a keen
interest in doing more business in this
market and an understanding of the
Australian viewpoint.
“I think we are going to sell more
capital equipment here than we are
selling now, and I also think we should
sell more,” said Mr. Mekata.
“But in Western Australia, at any
rate, they seem to be willing to buy
from Japan whenever it is possible to
do so. Sometimes the tariff is an
obstacle, and at other times they are
tied to certain specifications.”
Mitsui has a long association with
Australia, and in the postwar period
made an early start on the movement
of capital equipment to this country. It
supervised two singular electrical con-
tracts in the Sydney area—a submarine
cable across the entrance of Botany
Bay and another across Sydney Harbor.
(The Moura coal interest has been
mentioned earlier.)
Mr. Mekata is unquestionably an
authority on the Western Australian
situation, for the Mitsui business there
has been large and varied. Apart from
the 8000 h.p. dredge and power-
generating equipment at Port Hedland,
Mitsui has found a market in Western
Australia for iron-ore loaders, iron-ore
stackers, ore cars and ore-car dumpers,
automatic samplers, crushers, power
shovels, medium-duty trucks, conveyors,
screening equipment.
The key to Japan’s future prospects
in Australia is probably to be found in
Mr. Miura’s remark about Japan’s use
of its own machinery being the proof
of the pudding (“that is what has put
us where we are!”).
No longer do the steel men import
their blooming mills, including the
four-plate rolling mills. The plate mills
being installed these days are Japanese
without exception; so, too, are the hot
and cold strip mills, regarded as per-
haps the greatest post-war technical
innovation in the iron and steel
industry.
The manufacture of tandem mills
has been going on since 1963—mills
running at such terrific speed and call-
One of four Nordberg mill heads, each weighing 22 tons, landed from Japan
chemical industries. The enhancement
of crusher techniques owes much to the
amazing growth and rationalisation of
Japanese industry as a whole, and the
superb performance resulting from
these techniques has won the respect
of the mining world,
ing for such delicate adjustment of
their balance with the motors that
production would be impossible without
years of experience and maximum tech-
nical knowledge on the part of the
manufacturer.
The fact that so many industrial
machines are made to order to meet the
specific requirements of individual
users has a lot to do with the success
of industrial and mining machinery.
For its own growth and its own
modernisation every branch of industry
wants machinery and wants the best.
Thus, to satisfy each new and exacting
specification, necessarily, there has to
be an increasing progression in improve-
ments of this industrial machinery. The
striking evidence that it is meeting all
the demands made upon it is that these
persisting technical innovations are
such an important factor of Japan’s
economic growth.
There is an illustration of the close
relationship between makers and users
of industrial machinery in the develop-
ment in processes of manufacturing
crushers.
The crusher developed originally as
an ore-dressing machine; but Japan’s
deficiency in natural resources called
for an effort to extract high-grade ores
with maximum efficiency and economy.
Therefore, manufacturers and users co-
operated in improving crushers to the
point where they could meet newer and
more complicated purposes.
It is this constant pressure for higher-
type production which explains why
Japanese crushers were able not only
to match international standards at an
early stage but also to be used in other
industries besides mining including
the cement, the iron and steel, and the
and as for
future imports
It will be surprising,' with the
many tunnelling projects in cities
such as Sydney and Melbourne,
and in great public works and
mining undertakings, if there isn’t
an early call for a giant digging
machine by Komatsu Mfg. Co.
which performs at four times the
speed of the conventional dyna-
miting methods. It bores a tunnel
of 4.5 metres in diameter at a
maximum speed of 24 metres a
day, compared with the bare six
metres of conventional rock
blasting.
Japan Highways Public Cor-
poration is using it on the
projected 6.3-mile Ena Tunnel
for the Central Highway that will
be the future road link between
Tokyo and Nagoya. It will pierce
some of the most rugged moun-
tainous country in Japan. When
complete it will be the world’s
longest highway tunnel (after
Mt. Blanc, over nine miles).

Australian fishing
is on the rocks
In waters which yield riches to Japanese, Russian, and Chinese trawlers, our
pathetically inadequate Australian fleet doesn’t stand a chance of competing
By BRIAN HOAD
AUSTRALIA’S SMALL fleet of fishing
trawlers is all > washed up, with no
expectation of help from such measures
as the newly proclaimed 12-mile limit,
left high and dry without incentive and
lacking both the money and the
expertise to refloat itself. It has no
deep-sea trawlers, no research vessels,
and no factory ships to speak of. It
has a pathetically inadequate amount
of processing equipment and an anti-
quated marketing system. It is confined
to cockleshell boats pottering around
near the shore with charts drawn up by
the early explorers, and to adven-
turers in rubber suits grubbing about
on the sea-bed for the latest money-
spinning vogue in molluscs.
The Soviet Union, with ten research
and exploratory vessels sighted in Aus-
tralian waters over the past three years,
are the authorities on the whereabouts
and behaviour of the local fish and
are rumored to be coming to get them
with modern trawlers, with mother-
ships for processing the catch, and
research vessels to keep the fleet hot
on the trail.
The Italian Government, while offer-
ing financial aid to the fishing industry
here, pointed out that Russian and
Japanese interests were, for example,
taking some 60,000 tons of tuna each
year from local waters last year the
Australian fishing fleet made a total
haul of 43,000 tons (excluding mol-
luscs and crustaceans) valued at sl2£
million; fish imports into Australia
totalled 34,600 tons valued at $24 mil-
lion; and, by some fluke of international
trade, exports of 684 tons brought in
$416,000.
The sorry state of the industry re-
flected in these figures is an old one.
For years pleas for help have been
offered up to three generations of
Federal and State Ministers, who have
expounded on the potential and have
then proceeded to formulate ad hoc
measures which neither fit into a frame-
work of planned development nor pro-
vide the basis for expansion. Govern-
ment measures, as one embittered mem-
ber of the industry has put it, “reflect
the handmaiden status of an industry
of small capital investment, relatively,
low trade potential, and electoral in-
significance.” To the shame of a nation
surrounded by vast oceans, fishing, apart
from beekeeping, remains the smallest
of Australia’s primary industries.
Understandably, the industry has re-
sented the foreign successes in home
waters, it has indignantly rejected the
Italians’ offer of financial aid, and has
sadly suggested that the Federal
Government may care to check whether
the Soviet fleet uses special fishing tech-
niques which Australia could follow.
This month Canberra introduced its
latest ad hoc measure: a curtain is to
be lowered over the whole sorry affair;
the industry can at last languish in
privacy behind the new 12-mile barrier
imposed around Australia’s 12,000 miles
of coastline.
As far back as 1946, Canberra was
mooting the setting-up of a “Common-
wealth Fisheries Commission” to de-
velop new fishing grounds, implement
research, own and operate vessels, give
financial aid to fishermen for new boats
and equipment, support the co-
operatives, purchase redundant boats,
carry out navigational surveys, organise
education programs, and handle sales
promotion. All these good intentions
came to nothing; the conditions they
were intended to cure worsened.
Twenty years later the Food and
Agriculture Organisation of the United
Nations urged various countries, includ-
ing Australia, to examine the possibili-
ties of increasing the fish catch in the
Indian Ocean. Canberra thought it
possible and, even more rashly, ad-
mitted that the southern oceans sur-
rounding the place were probably one
of the few relatively underdeveloped
fishing areas of the world. Such brave
words demand actions, and at the be-
ginning of last year a “Fisheries
Development Conference” was called
in Canberra, an “Australian Fishing
Industry Council” was proposed, and
the State representatives exhorted to go
off and form their State branches. To

date, preliminary and faltering steps
have been taken by N.S.W. alone. The
buck has been successfully passed again.
The achievements of the States are
hardly less unimpressive. In 1953,
N.S.W. organised a committee of in-
quiry into the fishing industry, and
eight years later set up a State Fish
Authority with powers to establish mar-
kets, arrange for storage, make advances
out of a "reserve fund” to the industry,
and submit schemes to the Government
for the development of fish marketing
and distribution. The Authority has
since built a million-dollar market in
Sydney, which provides cold-storage
facilities and a waterfrontage for a
first time; it is at present providing a
$250,000 research ship for locating
deep-sea fishing grounds “the most
modern and well-equipped fishing
vessel ever used by Australia,” which
isn’t saying much; and it has purchased
two $BO,OOO filleting and skinning
machines from Germany in an attempt
to overcome the increasingly effete con-
sumer resistance toward the fishiness
of fish the heads, tails, scales, staring
eyes, and guts. Western Australia is at
present bragging about an old 600-ton
freighter, which it is converting into a
mothership for its “fishing fleet” at a
cost of $575,000; it is also offering a
dollar/dollar subsidy on research and
education programs within the industry,
as are Victoria and Tasmania. And
that is more or less the sum total of
government sops handed out in more
than 20 years.
The fishing industry, to bring itself
squarely into the 20th century, needs
large amounts of money, yet such are
the risks-elements involved in its present
state that financiers, including the
Development Bank, keep well away..
Some members of the industry believe
that import restrictions would help their
cause, providing the necessary protection
to attract investment. But imports are
now on too big a scale; they help, more-
over, to iron out the frequent gluts and
famines that possess the home industry
and, by so doing, protect prices from
the otherwise insane fluctuations which
would most likely wipe out the fairly
bored retail market altogether.
Canberra’s latest move, the 12-mile
limit, has now tipped the entire situa-
tion into absurdity. Early this month
14 Chinese fishing boats were sighted
heading toward the Great Barrier Reef.
Mr. W. J. Fulton, the Federal member
for the far-northern Leichhardt area,
called upon the Government to pro-
vide RAAF and naval patrols. The
Government replied that it was Queens-
land’s responsibility to police its own
territory out to the 12-mile limit. Mr.
Fulton said that Queensland had no
RAAF and no Navy and couldn’t do a
thing about policing. It’s a pity that
Australia has such a vast coastline,
for if ever this matter of responsibility
is sorted out, the policing authority will
find they have a pretty expensive ser-
vice on their hands. It would be money
better spent on putting fishing back on
its feet again.

Some future prospects for
British exports
IT LOOKED a far from cheerful
omen when Australian imports of
British goods dropped by almost half
in the first month after last November’s
devaluation of sterling. True there
was a special reason; the British dock
strike (but how unusual is a British
dock strike?) caused this downturn in
what had been a modestly rising level
of Australian imports of British goods
during 1967-68, so that the first half
year’s import figures released last week
show our buying from Britain had
fallen by about $3 million less (at
$328 million) than the month of
December’s downturn of $27 million.
Had there been no dock strike, we
would probably have bought about
one percent more than last year, which
is not very good, anyway.
Presumably the second half of the
year will more than make up
December’s loss, as the benefits of
devaluation (and the end of the strike)
slowly filter through into the official
statistics. But the prospects of any
significant increase in British exports
here look slight unless they can be won
at the expense of rival suppliers. For
combined with the prospect of special
protection for some industries affected
by devaluation, is the clear indication
that Australia’s imports are going up
at a fairly modest rate, reflecting a
quiet rate of rise in demand at both
the producer and consumer levels of
the economy. For instance, total im-
ports in the first half of the year were
up less than five percent on some
period of the previous year with rises
in imports from some countries being
largely offset by falls from others. For
example, New Zealand’s rise from
11th to Bth in the list of suppliers was
offset by Indonesia’s drop from 7th
to 9th and Saudi Arabia’s from 10th
to 11th as Australia reduced its depen-
dence on overseas oil (oil imports
dropped by about 4£ percent to $llB
million) and built up production from
its newly found local fields.
But what of Britain’s ability to in-
crease its exports generally, following
devaluation. Last December the Aus-
tralian Government’s advisers forecast
that Britain’s export advantages were
likely to disappear in Australia within
six to 12 months, with British exporters
getting a real benefit initially of only
about half the 14.3 percent devaluation.
But the OECD in Paris expects the
U.K. to do better than this in general.
“Devaluation has given U.K. manufac-
turers a net cost advantage of the order
of 10 percent,” says the OECD. “On
any normal assumption about the
response of trade to cost and price
changes, the benefit to the trade
account should be substantial and
could, over time, even exceed the
Government’s target of an improve-
ment of £5OO million or $1.2 billion.”
Aluminium
Strange dollars
boost Alcoa
BUT WHAT ABOUT JAPAN? When
Alcoa of Australia was talking a few
months ago about raising a lot of
money to finance an expansion program
aimed largely at increasing expor* to
Japan, there were strong suggestions
that the Japanese may well contribute
some of the cash needed. But last week
all Sir Lindesay Clark, chairman (in
this instance) of Alcoa of Australia
would say about Japan, in announcing
the company’s loan of $4l million from
the Euro-dollar market to finance the
expansion of its Kwinana alumina re-
finery, was, that the negotiations for
the supply of more alumina to that
country “were continuing”. But appar-
ently Japan will not now be providing
any of the capital for the expansion
which is of course already under way
to an extent that by the end of the
year capacity will be 800,000 tons, or
more than four times the original. It
would be intriguing to know why earlier
suggestions that Japanese capital might
be enlisted came to nothing. However,
Sir Lindesay did proffer the useful addi-
tional information that “the larger we
can make smelting capacity at Port
Henry the better”. Which seems to
suggest that although it now has a sur-
plus of aluminium metal for e'xport an
expansion of smelting capacity is now
a very good prospect for the reason-
ably near future, the more so perhaps
because, as he stated, the company’s
own power plant being constructed on
the Anglesea brown coal field will be
completed within the year. At present
the smelting operations at Point Henry
Alcoa aluminium .. .Japanese puzzle
depend on the supply of power (at
concessional rates) from the Victorian
State Electricity Commission which
has recently been plagued by a deal of
industrial trouble. Although strikes
haven’t affected supplies of electricity
to Point Henry they have been an ugly
shadow overhanging its operations.
It looks as if the cost of the Euro-
dollar loan will be roughly the same as
would be a similar amount raised on
the Australian capital market, or a bit
cheaper even given the addition of ser-
vice and with-holding tax charges on
the basic 5£ percent interest rate.
There is probably not much in it,
though Sir Lindesay couldn’t be drawn
either on the comparison or on exactly
how much the loan would cost the
company. Anyhow, from Australia’s
viewpoint it is a very good deal, parti-
cularly at this time when capital is
hard to come by overseas, what with
British and U.S. curbs on its export.
There was probably no questions be-
cause of U.S. restrictions of Alcoa of
America (which owns 51 percent of the
Australian company) putting up the
amount (in addition to loans of about
$lOO million it has already lent it) nor
guaranteeing it, so it is a nice piece of
work for it to have harvested $4l
million of those $lO,OOO million dollars
now floating around the world-in the
hands of non-U.S. residents. It is a pity
we couldn’t attract a lot more of it
here. Only one other Australian con-
cern (Queensland Alumina, also in the
alumina business, at Gladstone) has
succeeded in laying its hand on some
of these strange dollars and the Aus-
tralian Government itself, though it has
also had some in the past, has recently
been finding it pretty difficult to enter
the play.


THE WEEK
BRIEFLY
For the economy: A record number of immigrants
left Australia permanently last year, and the number of new
immigrants continued the steady decline of recent years.
Total net gain was 112,717 ... In trade, Japan increased
its exports to Australia by $27.2m. in the six months to
December 1967, while British exports to Australia fell by
$23.6m. . . . Registrations of new motor-vehicles in January
were the highest on record for any January, and up 14.5
percent on January, 1967 . . . Minister for Labor and
National Service, Mr. Bury, warned that Government spend-
ing would have to be cut or taxes increased if claims for
an automatic flow-on of the Metal Trades wage rises to
other unions were granted; he said thoughts of increasing
personal living standards must be subordinated to the needs
of the nation.
For the markets: The local investment market
firmed toward the end of the week, and the mining market
on Friday consolidated Thursday’s upturn. Golds took the
spotlight on Friday . . . Outstanding feature of the London
market was the great strength of gold shares as rumors of
the future of major currencies prompted strong demand
. . . On Wall Street golds were also a feature in response
to speculation that the U.S. may place an embargo on
her dwindling gold supply.
For companies: In the year to December, Howard
Smith’s profit eased six percent, largely due to lower sugar
prices. The company made a slm. capital profit on the sale
of shares, so could well afford to lift dividend from 10 to
11£ percent . . . lAC boosted earnings 11.4 percent . . .
and after a four-year run of profit declines Courtaulds made
solid recovery, lifting profit to $943,000 or 6.9 percent on
capital. An important interim came from BHP, reporting
for the November six months that profit was somewhat
higher after a worthwhile lift in sales. Since November,
local demand has declined noticeably for some products,
so exports —where margins are lower—have been increased.
The nickel search in the West has so far been disappointing,
while the Rockhampton nickel potential has not yet been
assessed.
The thirteen-day strike at Boral’s refinery ended with the
company resuming negotiations with the AWU after the men
returned to work . . . Chicago Bridge and Iron Co. severed
its link with ACI, and has set up its own structural steel
business in competition . . . An offshoot of Tyree Industries.
Ltd., Tyree Power Equipment, will float, giving priority to
Tyree shareholders . . . Backdoor listing of Dane Industries,
refrigeration and air-conditioning engineer, will be effected
by merger with Anglo Pacific Securities.
BHP has elected to retain a 50 percent working interest
in the Halibut and Kingfish oilfields rather than a 12J per-
cent royalty.
An Adelaide sharebroker has assessed that Mt. Isa shares
are worth $8.50 . . . Hamersley is making its first trial
shipment of 40,000 to 50,000 tons of iron ore to several
large U.S. steel mills . . . Alcoa has arranged to borrow
up to $41.3m. in Europe to finance expansion at Point
Henry, Anglesea, and the Kwinana alumina refinery . . .
Murphyores will establish an ilmenite, rutile, and zircon
plant at Gladstone to treat concentrates produced from the
Point Richards area . . . King Island Scheelite considers
open-cut methods for the rich new ore body below the
original seabed ... A public float is expected soon to
finance exploitation of the Misima Island (Papua) gold and
silver prospect, with shareholders of Pacific Island Mines
and Cultus Exploration Ltd., of Canada, probably getting
priority.
MEN AND
MATTERS
LAST WEEK, at Australian Electrical
Industries Ltd., the Raines went. After
a three-year spell as executive chair-
man, during which time he succeeded
in breaking the profit drought that had
afflicted the company for so long,
lively, young (38 years old) accountant
R. B. Raines has stepped down from
AEI following the acquisition of its
British parent company by Mr. Arnold
Weinstocks’ smaller, but more dynamic,
General Electric Co. (no relation to
the U.S. company of the same name).
AEI in Australia is now to be merged
Into the local GEC organisation, and
Ron Raines has been asked to join
the board of the new local holding
company, but not as an executive.
Ron Raines had left a prominent Syd-
ney accountancy partnership to become
executive chairman of AEI in Novem-
ber, 1964, when the company’s profits
were at a low ebb and 21 months after
the U.K. parent had bought out its
Australian shareholders at par follow-
ing seven sorry years on the local lists.
The object had been to get the com-
pany back to a respectable earning rate
and then to invite the Australian
investing public to put their faith in
AEI once again. Under the Raines-led
new management team, the strategy was
well on the way to success.
Before joining AEI Ltd. as deputy
chairman and chairman of the oper-
ating subsidiaries, he was a joint
receiver for Tulloch Ltd. Mr. Raines
sees his future in company manage-
ment. Currently he is chairman of J.
Kohler and Sons and F. G. Kerr (both
listed companies) and a director of
Kempthorne Holdings (lighting and
fans), and of Johnson Mat they (gold
refiners).
ADELAIDE engineering graduates with
predilections for the mining side of the
profession used to turn, more often than
not, to the great lead and zinc mines
over the N.S.W. border at Broken Hill
to learn the tricks of the trade. Nowa-
days the route is still very much open,
but new paths to experience and em-
ployment for engineers have opened up
in so many other directions that the
traffic to Broken Hill is no longer as
thick as it was in the old days. How-
ever, two who obviously don’t regret
having taken it are the two directors
recently appointed to the board of Con-
zinc Riotinto of Australia, and both
now resident in Melbourne, Frank F.
Espie and Russel T. Madigan, who get
their seats for distinguished services at
rapidly developing outposts of the
groups far flung empire,
Burma-born Mr. Espie, who is man-
aging director of Bougainville Copper
Pty. Ltd., worked at Broken Hill for
14 years, rising to be assistant general
Ron Raines
Frank Espie
manager of the Zinc Corporation and
New Broken Hill before being ap-
pointed general manager of CRA’s in-
dustrial division. In the past three years,
as well as being closely associated with
the copper prospect in New Guinea,
he has been general manager of the
group’s industrial division and also on
the board of several of its subsidiaries.
Mr. Madigan was born in Adelaide,
took his masters degree in engineering
there, and also an LL.B. before going to
the Hill. In 1947 he went overseas for
two years on a Gowrie travelling
scholarship, ultimately becoming under-
ground manager at both the Zinc Cor-
poration and NBH. Very early in the
Hamersley piece, he was made com-
mercial manager and a little later
(October, 1965) managing director of
zincs.

THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
The privilege
of subsidising
public utilities
BY J. C. HORSFALL
AUSTRALIAN FIRMS, businesses big
and small, stoically bear the host of
imposts tha’t authority, in its innumer-
able guises, chooses to put on them,
usually without warning and mostly
without prior discussion. Australians are
probably no worse off in this respect
than businesses and people in other
countries, though many of us think we
must be, or at any rate feel we could
hardly be more heavily imposed upon.
One needn’t here recount the full range
of authorities lurking round the busi-
nessman’s corner to drop their hats. For
a good running example, outside the
range of Federal and State governments,
semi-government, and local government
bodies there’s no need to go past the
Arbitration Commission.
However, it is not the Arbitration
Commission’s rather contrary hat which
has been tossed about more unpredict-
ably than usual in recent months (fin-
ally to be dropped without a blush on
employers’ toes) that’s tempted me to
air the matter of these imposts. It is
(and those who live outside Melbourne
or don’t have trams to travel in or
don’t have to listen to their clattering,
please don’t smirk or turn away) the
annual report of the Melbourne and
Metropolitan Tramways Board, whose
distinguished chairman is the redoubt-
able R. J. FI. Risson - he has far too
many decorations, military and civil,
degrees, fellowships, etc., to detail them
all here, although all ten are given in
the report. Mr. Risson is in very fine
form in this report, dilating on the
Board’s finances and imposts as well as
on the economics of public utilities and
their contribution to our scheme of
things in general. Broadly, his message
is that if most of the public utilities
(and the Melbourne Tramways Board
for certain) may appear from their
accounts to be a drag on the economy,
precisely the opposite is the case. What
is more, taxpayers should count them-
selves fortunate that they are not called
upon more heavily to contribute to the
cost of public utilities in compensation
for the benefits they confer on the
business and general community.
Some time ago, an academic said
at La Trobe University that if it was
recouped for the social benefits it con-
fers on the community, the Melbourne
Tramways Board would be a profitable
enterprise. Mr. Risson caps that by
saying (and this will make all similar
public utilities in Australia see red)
that it is the only comparable authority
in the country, indeed one of the few
in the world, that would be. One
cannot confirm or deny his claim,
though Mr. Risson is not one to make
idle claims.
It is equally true, or so it seems to
me, that the Board can continue
to run its chronic deficits (last year
just short of $1 million) only because
they are underwritten by the State
Government. In terms of dollar contri-
butions to cover the deficits, the Govern-
ment is no more nor less than businesses
and other taxpayers in the State. In
effect, it is the taxpayers who are
recouping the Tramways Board for the
community benefits it confers, at least
in the narrower of the two senses in
which the chairman construes them.
Taking last year’s figures to illus-
trate the point, the report shows that
if the Board had been able to recoup
only half the annual travel concessions
($1.23 million) it gave to scholars, pen-
sioners, disabled servicemen, and others
and what it spends on roadways for
its tram tracks ($930,000) —which it
considers to be a free contribution to
the community’s roads —it would have
shown a surplus.
Even looking at the benefits the
Board bestows on the community from
this narrower viewpoint, it may well be
wondered precisely what Mr. Risson is
getting at. It could be he is simply
offering Sir Henry Bolte some gratui-
tous ammunition to fire in support of
higher taxes. Or is it that the Tramways
Board is fed up with recording deficits
year after year (however useful these
may be for holding up wage, long ser-
vice leave, and other employees’ claims)
and is determined to reflect more truly
its undoubted efficiency in its accounts?
The latter certainly seems true, because
this year the Board has written back all
its accumulated provisions for accrued
sick leave, long service leave, retirement
gratuities, fire damage, public liability
claims, and obsolecence of stores to re-
duce the accumulated deficit. (Actually
from $5.12 to $2.2 million.)
Also, it has treated its actual outlays
on a lot of these items as operating ex-
penses indeed, they account for all
but $lOO,OOO or so of the Board’s
$930,000 deficit for the year.
The Board’s accountants can amuse
themselves at their will. For Mr. Ris-
son’s part, there is more open determin-
ation to drive the tram and bus figures
hard dowm Sir Henry’s alley when he
takes up the theme in this report that
the social and economic benefits the
Board confers on the community don’t,
by any means, end with the travel con-
cessions and road-making. “Notwith-
standing that it may superficially appear
to lose money,” he states, “urban trans-
port is an excellent community invest-
ment . . . even if recognition of the im-
portance and, indeed, the necessity of its
services does not make the Board’s fin-
ancial problem less acute.” His elabor-
ation of these wider outflowing com-
munity services is very much to the
point and will doubtless excite the
attention of public utility revenue
gatherers all over the country.
“Overlooking for the moment,” he
states, “the aged, the young, the infirm,
and the relatively impecunious who
cannot drive themselves but must still
travel, if the remainder tried to use
private motor cars no city’s street sys-
tem could accommodate them; nor
could any city centre provide space
to park their cars and leave any city
worth coming to. No one perhaps has
a greater real interest in maintaining
public transport than the private
motorist; so long as others will continue
to travel by train, tram, or bus he is
still able to drive his car, albeit in in-
creasing discomfort.” Obviously Mr.
Risson would like the motorist, includ-
ing industrial and commercial transport,
to pay a bit more for the privilege.
Then, for good measure (perhaps for
the benefit of those who would like to
follow' Sydney and put all Melbourne
trams on the scrap heap or in
museums), he adds: “On simple
economics, too, public transport merits
retention, and development. A four-
lane freeway in Melbourne will cost of
the order of $2 million per mile—
and carry a maximum of 2500 people
per lane per hour: 5000 per hour each
way on the whole freeway. For $2-
million the Board can build ten miles
of double-track tramway, which will
carry up to 13,000 people per hour
each way in a street with intersecting
streets, or upwards of 20,000 in a free-
way. The mathematics and economics
are obvious. Rolling stock costs (trams
versus motor cars) and operating costs
are likewise heavily on the side of
public transport.”
It is conceivable, of course, that in
introducing his new stamp duty this
year Sir Henry was not unaware of
the sort of argument Mr. Risson puts
up to slug business (mostly) and the
community in general to get revenue
to cover all the deficits of public utilities
in the State, deficits which more than
anything else have been a drain on
the State’s finances over many years.
If he gets away with it—and even if
Mr. Gorton again looked to be hot
on his trail last week—it won’t be
long before all other States will follow
suit. Western Australia has a similar
community-wide duty device, and the
winds are blowing that way in Tas-
mania.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Wise men say
nothing in
dangerous times
IT WAS ON TODAY’S memo on my
desk calendar and seemed appropriate
to the current state of the mining mar-
ket: “Wise men say nothing in danger-
ous times.” I don’t know that I’m par-
ticularly wise, but in the circumstances
I reckon I’d be silly to say anything
more.
On the industrial side, however, things
aren’t at all dangerous and I feel quite
safe in speaking up. Furthermore, I feel
safe enough to buy up: 300 each of
A. V. Jennings and TNT and 500
R. Fowler.
A. V. Jennings is a hot one, and has
been for some time it even has the
chairman of the Melbourne Stock Ex-
change, Mr. C. T. Hooker, as a board
member. For the past five years its
results have been consistently excellent
(not bad, when industry conditions
have often been more thin than thick),
the latest interim report being no ex-
ception: profit went up by over 60
percent to $839,000. If you adjust this
figure to an annual basis (double it),
the company would have a return on
paid capital of around 48 percent. This
gives the 12 percent dividend rate a
massive cover of four times over. On
this basis, some sort of capital benefit
or dividend increase would seem to be
as sure as Christmas. Just to make the
odds even more appealing is the fact
that in 1967 the company earned 65
percent of its record profit of $1,450,000
in the second part of the year. If these
are the circumstances again this year,
Jennings will have an earning rate of
over 50 percent, which will mean it
will just have to do something about
an issue or the Government will give
it a “please explain” for showing such
a high earning rate.
Another company that’s very big in
the earnings division is TNT. Being a
bit overkeen for profits, I sold out a
holding in this company only a few
weeks ago. I shouldn’t have. Now I’ve
got to buy back in. The company is
doing too well for me not to have a
holding. Last year it had an earning
rate of 21 percent and this year direc-
tors have already anticipated 24 per-
cent. This, however, seems too modest.
Already the profit earned in the first
half of the year is in itself equal to
16 percent on capital. All the company
has to do is earn half this amount in
the second half of the year and it’s got
it made. This is too easy a goal for
TNT. My guess is that its earning
rate will be far in excess of its estimate,
for, let’s face it, very few company
directors make public predictions unless
they are pretty darn sure they’ll come
true. It’s too embarrassing and it is
also one of those things that investors
just never forget or forgive. With
further benefits still to come from the
rationalisation of the Cousins and
Alltrans mergers, TNT looks like a
company that can’t help but do well.
Another company that’s going to do
well this year is R. Fowler Ltd. This
company has a sizable chunk of the
sanitary-ware market and there is little
doubt that almost everyone in Australia
has used its products at one time or
another. It’s a company that gives a
very cyclical sort of performance (both
in profit and share price), but if you
can catch it on the up-swing and miss
it on the down, it can be a rewarding
investment. It now looks like starting
an up-swing. The interim results of
companies in the building trade, which
are now starting to trickle in, give the
clue. They have generally been very
good. Every indication is that R. Fowler
will follow suit. Selling at 78 cents, the
shares are close to a five-year price low.
This compares with a highest in excess
of $1.50 for every year since 1963 with
the exception of last year, when they
only reached $l.OB. Even if they only
reach $1 in the next few months, they’ll
still do me. Another thing I like about
this company is that its 50-cent shares
are all backed by $1.85 worth of assets.
Incidentally, have you noticed the
call options that have been taken out in
James Wallace lately?

A major boom in finance
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
TO HELL WITH all this extra com-
petition; the good old established
finance companies are still an out-
standing investment. True, the extra
$14.4 million business done by the
dynamic - looking FNCB - Waltons
operation is making inroads into the
market, the foreign bank-owned or con-
trolled companies are still potentially
dangerous (even though they have not
yet proved it), and the finance offshoots
cf the American-owned motor-makers
out here are, at best, an unattractive
feature of the industry. But these are
only pin-pricks. For this is an excel-
lent year for the finance companies,
certainly a lot better than the stock-
market thinks, even though it has
handed out some hefty rises already
to shares of most of the bigger, suc-
cessful operators. Now that all the
major ones have reported for the six
months to December, it is clear that
the period was one of massive growth
In outstandings—eight, of them increased
outstandings by $l5O million in the
last six months. And at this stage
these are even more important
figures than the generally far more
modest profit rises for the period.
These rises in gross outstandings —•
In the business actually done—that are
listed in the table on this page, are all
far greater proportionally than the
profit rises reported. (This is true for
Associated Securities, too, in reality, for
if the company had made a similar
$125,000 provision in the latest term
for doubtful debts that it made, un-
necessarily it appears, in the previous
period, then its profit would have risen
by only about 15 percent or so. And
AGC’s profit in the latest period also
benefited from a lower tax provision.)
There is a good reason for this; the
leading finance companies all deduct
the quite heavy expenses involved in
writing new business as they happen,
even though they would be entitled to
write them off over the period of the
contracts. And the same goes for
stamp-duty costs and borrowing costs.
So when companies have huge rises
in outstandings like AGC’s $37 million
in the latest six months, of Associated
Securities’ $24 million, the costs
involved are very heavy in the period
involved. Some estimates are that it
takes three months before a finance
company begins to make money on a
new contract.
The implications of this are signi-
ficant; there should be a massive rise
in profits once the benefits of the big
rises in business done in the first half
of the current year show in the
accounts. And, ironically enough, they
will show quicker if monetary .condi-
tions get tougher fairly soon. While
the financiers can raise money as easily
as they could in the flush December
half of 1967 (and in the early months
of 1968), they have found no shortage
of good borrowers. If money, becomes
in fairly short supply, as many expect
it to shortly, then the finance com-
panies will face lower costs through
writing less business and will be able
to coast along on the bumper business
of the first half of the year. Most of
them are very liquid at present just
in case things do get tough—this is
also a drag on profitability that would
be removed once they had to put these
liquid funds to work.
Then there is the added bonus that
if money does get tight there will be
increasing demand for finance com-
pany assistance from “quality” cus-
tomers. No longer does the finance
business simply depend on the old
hire-purchase operations on motor cars
and other consumer products, even
though these are still the bulk of the
business for most companies. Nowa-
days, the demand is for much more
diversified financial services. The
proportions vary between companies;
Associated Securities, for instance,
seems to have about half its business
outside the consumer field, but lAC
seems still to be heavily involved des-
pite a significant swing toward leas-
ing, which it more than trebled in the
latest year. In any event, the move-
ments in outstandings for the Decem-
ber six months give some basis to the
wide differences between dividend
yields of the major financiers. AGC’s
4.2 percent at $l.BO and Associated
Securities’ 4.3 percent at $1.83 reflect
greater growth expectations than lAC’s
5.4 percent at $l.lO (what a bargain
these were last year when we recom-
mended them at 70 cents!) or Alliance
Holdings’ 6.7 percent at 75 cents. But
they all look good value; the market
has certainly not yet accounted for
the implications of the major increases
of business in this sector.

The Chartist says:
GOLD MINES OF KALGOORLIE, in view of the overall pattern on the chart
and recent market action in relation to gold stocks, could warrant the attention of
investors wanting to take up a defensive position. After rising to a peak of
$2.50 in November, 1967, prices reacted back to the support level at $1.20 and
further consolidation has since followed. A renewal of the uptrend could be
expected in the short term and an initial target of about $3.40 is a possibility.
There is also a higher, more optimistic target for the longer term—about $B.OO.

about $2O within the following six
months before they even began to show
a profit. There are only a couple of
months left for the first of these
options, which will fall due early in
May, to pay off. But the steady stream
of six-month calls in BHP since then
(BHP was the beginning of the popu-
larity of six-month calls; most options
had previously been for three months)
has probably added another 40,000 or
so to the list, covering shares worth
about $2.5 million at current prices,
but which some very big investors
expect will soon be worth about $3
million. But this steady activity in
BPIP is not the only reason that busi-
ness in call options is still so buoyant,
mostly in mining and oils, although
Boral is continuing to receive a lot of
attention.
The rising interest in Longreach, first
noted here in January, when 40,000
calls were taken out in one week,
brought another 6000 calls last week;
the mounting tide in support of Oil
Search added a further 20,000 to the
hundreds of thousands bought in recent
times; the new “in” speculation,
Ravenshoe, came in for another 5500
options to add to the previous week’s
9000, and other speculations like Vam,
Great Boulder, Hill 50, and Westralian
were again in pretty heavy demand.
There was also some interest in heavy-
weights like Peko-Wallsend (which has
just' about everything running for it
right now), Mt. Isa, and Kathleen
Investments. And now that coal is
such a nice word, even R. W. Miller
made another appearance in the lists.
JAMES WALLACE HOLDINGS,
whose Rocks redevelopment scheme was
shelved last year, seems to have come
off the rocks in more ways than one.
Although investors usually have to
wait another two months for James
Wallace to report on the first half of
1967-68 (the Sydney builder and con-
tractor is among the slowest reporters
in the game), investors who took out
12,000 call options last week at 36c
and 40c are hopeful that the shares will
at least regain par within six months.
A hefty loss of the best part of $1 mil-
lion in 1966 after a barely profitable
year to June, 1965, was followed by a
good recovery last year, with a profit of
$328,000 or 24.8 percent on capital.
Reorganisation improved liquidity and
allowed the group to concentrate on
its building and development activities,
and contracts in hand in Australasia at
the end of October were in excess of
$2O million. In October, 1967, the
Chartist reviewed the stock at 34c, and
described it as in a reaction stage with
the base consolidation suggesting a short
term rise to between 65c and 70c.

The Melbourne market
More delving into
industrials
WORKING ON THE MAXIM that
every dog has his day, a good deal of
delving is being done around the city
just now to divine the most likely candi-
dates among industrial shares for a
turn at the tracks.
One special assumption behind the
search is that (quite apart from the fact
it is the market’s function to assess the
relative merits of all shares it deals in
on a continuing basis), if and when the
dividend yield structure of industrials
as a whole moves to a lower basis, some
shares will make the adjustment more
rapidly and positively than others. This,
it is argued, will happen because in the
last year or so when mining shares have
dominated interest largely because of
the expectation of capital gains, yields
relationships between industrials have
been comparatively neglected. To
bring this about, though, will also re-
quire a redirection of continuing capital
gains in mining shares on the one hand
and, on the other, the non-emergence
of counteracting attraction from the

side of bonds and other fixed interest
investments. Anyhow, the general run
of industrials has been neglected for so
long that exercises to sort them all
out would seem to be increasingly
appropriate.
Last week’s interims provided
several clues to help in this exercise.
If one is looking for shares with
improving earnings cover, though not
necessarily with high dividend yields.
Two that seem to stand out are Com-
modore Motels, yielding 5.5 percent
and about twice covered by earnings,
and TNT transport, albeit yielding
only 3.4 percent, following the 70 per-
cent profit increase in the first half
of this year to provide (on an annual
basis) just short of a notional 2.7 times
earnings cover for the 12 percent divi-
dend rate.
True, Commodore didn’t provide any
precise profit figures, merely stating
that profits were well maintained, but
judging by the substantial rise in turn-
over for the six months from
$2,054,865 to $2,436,177 directors
seem to have solid grounds for their
confidence that the profit out-turn for
the full year will show an improve-
ment on last year. They are expecting
all the diverse new developments put in
train in the last year or so both in
the suburbs and the city to pay off
on a rising scale in the three fields of
hotels, motels, and restaurants. In the
case of the Matthew Flinders Hotel at
Gladstone (there’s no other pub for
miles around), which will open on
April 8, they’re expecting its receipts
to exceed all the group’s other under-
takings. As well as this they’ve already
opened a restaurant in Exhibition
Street and a new motel at the corner
of Lygon and Queensberry Streets,
Carlton. They’re also lined up to take
over the Conference Hotel in Flinders
Street, which is presently being re-
modelled, and also the Sandringham
Hotel out of town, for which a licence
has been applied for. Diversification
is the order of the day, though motels,
say the board, still remain the main
interest.
Admittedly, TNT’s profit lift owes
a lot to the incorporation of the new
subsidiaries (Cargo, Alltrans, and
Cousins Transport) in 1966-67, so that
this, coupled with the fact that all the
shares handed out in the takeovers
ranked for the recent six percent
interim, renders the above assumed
dividend cover somewhat suspect. On
the other hand, and even if these sub-
sidiaries continue to trade separately,
it seems that big economies have been
achieved in the centralising of their
administration and control around
computer techniques. Anyway, any
obscurities as to earnings cover should
be removed progressively because it’s
the board’s intention to make quarterly
statements in September and March,
giving four progressive glimpses of the
out-turn each year. As TNT is des-
tined to play a big part in container
inland transport when the scheduled
services start from the U.K. next year
these shares are well worth considera-
tion.
A. V. Jennings’ one-for-four new
issue at 90 cents premium on the 50
cents par is another harbinger of
expansion ahead for this group in an
industry where further good tidings in
the form of higher profits (unfortu-
nately no precise figures in one case)
for two other companies, E. A. Watts
and J. Mcllwraith Industries, which
have been mentioned favorably here in
the past few weeks. Watts mentioned
that its turnover had. increased by 11
percent in the latest half year, at the
end of which it had $5l million of un-
completed work. Mcllwraith, in its
turn, lifted profit by 8.8 percent, and
the fact that this was achieved with an
increase of only 1.43 percent increase
in turnover shows that the biggest sup-
plier of building materials in the coun-
try is enjoying higher profit margins.
But is this the result of higher prices
or increased efficiency?

Salt for the Japanese market
A TWENTYFOLD increase in five
years, not a bad record for any industry,
seems well within the capabilities of
Australia’s newest minerals export indus-
try salt. From an export of 93,400
tons in 1966, Australia is set to ship out
2 million tons or more by 1971, mainly
to Japan’s hungry chemicals complexes,
with capacity to export much more.
The short shipping haul and the suit-
ability of the climate to solar salt pro-
duction, has brought about this phen-
omenal growth pattern. But it has also
brought problems.
Japan imports about 4.5 million tons
of salt annually. Australia’s planned
salt export projects would, by the early
19705, meet this demand alone, and
that makes no allowance for the com-
petition of Mexico (2 million tons),
Red China (1 million), and India
(500,000). Of the eight new Australian
schemes under way (see table), only
ICIANZ’s Port Alma project in Queens-
land has expressed no export aspira-
tions. Two of the projects could survive
only with help from their State govern-
ments, and even the remaining five
might create competition so cut-throat
that the industry could lose its appeal,
as projected capacity totals more than
10 million tons a year, or more than
double Japan’s total imports.
In Perth last week, Norseman Gold
Mines and Sumitomo representatives
had placed before the State Govern-
ment their scheme for harvesting salt
from Lake Defroy. This would be
hinged on the State building a railway
line from the lake to Widgiemooltha,
up-grading the line from there to Espe-
rance, and lowering the freight rate
from the usual $5.50 to $2.20 per ton.
While this might seem a tall order, the
partners can point out that the same
concessions were made to Western Min-
ing when they were floating their
Koolanooka enterprise that became the
first of the iron ore export projects.
If Norseman and Sumitomo can win
these concessions, they maintain that
they can start shipping out salt from
the lake early next year, catching the
rich market before their competitors
can set up their solar salt projects, with
higher capital outlay but much lower
running expenses. The South Australian
scheme faces similar difficulties, al-
though profit from gypsum might over-
come them.
Texada, too, are relying on their
backstop potash production. This
company, in mid-March, will submit
plans for building a port at Cape Cuvier,
near Carnarvon, based upon a cash
flow generated from the sale of solar
salt. The Western Australia Government
has made it clear to them that potash
is the industry that’s wanted; clearance
to go ahead with salt export would be
a bonus to this $ 13-million project.
Exmouth Salt also plan a solar opera-
tion. This company is owned by five
Western Australians, led by engineers
with experience in the salt field. They
are also associated with a Japanese trad-
ing company, whose representatives will
be visiting the site in March. Little is
known about this group, except that
they plan to spend $6 million setting
up the scheme, which, they say, could
be operating in 1970.
The other three groups have met
one of the key problems of this indus-
try provision of ports. Shark Bay
Salt, the first one to get operating (after
a delay of three seasons because of soil
porosity problems), has a protected port
near its Useless Loop crystallising ponds.
The big Leslie Salt project, near Port
Hedland, will use the harbor being
developed for the Mount Newman Iron
operation. Last week it flooded 240
acres of crystallising ponds with brine
and has significantly increased its orig-
inal design capacity. Comalco hope to
get started through Dampier, the
Hamersley Iron port.
As with nickel, this has become a
race for a market. Despite the current
high shipping costs, Australia’s proxim-
ity to Japan, combined with the low
initial costs of the harvesting, or the
low operating costs of the solar salt
producers, would enable them to make
good profits in the short term. Unlike
iron ore, whose export is controlled
from Canberra, salt is directed from
the State capitals, with a different per-
spective to the dangers of over-compet-
ing and over-production.

Behind the balance sheets
Houghton and Byrne: the ups
and downs of hired killers
NEXT' WEEK the market will know
whether its new-found enthusiasm for
the smallish Sydney-based pest-control
company Houghton and Byrne Hold-
ings Ltd. is soundly based. The interim
report, to be released a week or so
later than usual (the managing-direc-
tor has just returned from overseas) is
not likely to hold many surprises. That
in itself could be justification enough
for the company’s 50-cent shares mov-
ing up by one-third from last year’s
low of 90 cents to recent prices around
$1.20. A steady dividend and a “satis-
factory” profit may be all that the
market really needs.
For this would be good news com-
pared with last year’s accounts, which
looked far from healthy. With com-
petition increasing from the big British-
owned Rentokil group through its H.
W. Powell (“I’m Powellised”) sub-
sidiary, with unfavorable seasonal con-
ditions (and in particular a savagely
reduced wheat crop) affecting its rural
activities, with a sizable build-up of
stocks and debtors (largely due to ex-
pansion of newly acquired and yet
untested—subsidiaries) adding a touch
of uneasiness, and with the net profit
failing to meet the higher 15 percent
dividend, Houghton and Byrne looked
a far-from-safe investment.
But things seem to have improved
a bit since then. Its highly diversified
subsidiaries appear to have been pulling
their weight (in the first three months
they had traded at a “satisfactory” level
according to the chairman last October)
and he expected that “further benefits
should be derived from the effects of
the recent rains in some of the drought-
stricken areas.” But they would need
to, for the company had a disappoint-
ing time in the second half of 1966-67
because of drought, which explains why
its profit was unexpectedly insufficient
to cover last year’s higher dividend
rate set by the 1\ percent interim.
Revival of feed in N.S.W. and
Queensland will bring rabbits and other
pests. Houghton and Byrne’s agricul-
tural division is a major supplier of
rabbit fumigants and po’isons. But off-
setting this is the wheat situation, for
the company’s grain and ship fumiga-
tion was in demand after the record
1966-67 wheat crop of 462 m. bushels.
The 1967-68 harvest is expected to yield
only about 260 m. bushels. But a grow-
ing proportion of the company’s
activities is not subject to these cli-
matic factors (just as a lot of its pest-
control operations, being urgent, are
not subject to the general state of the
economy).
The company’s greatest penetration
is in industrial activities, protecting
seeds, grain, and other stored products,
ships, cargoes, public utilities, and food-
processing plants. In this field, it claims
to be bigger than all other Australian
pest controllers put together.
In commercial fields, treatment and
protection against all pests in hospitals,
hotels, motels, restaurants, offices,
schools, and institutions, and in the
domestic field, treating and protecting
homes against all pests, Houghton and
Byrne has more competition. But its
services cover the entire range of pest
control, and the major portion of the
business is servicing contracts, rather
than the supply of chemical materials.
The advent of the big U.K. Rentokil
group in 1966 through H. W. Powell
and several companies of the Australian
Pest Services group has not had a
great impact in Houghton and Byrne’s
home State of N.S.W., the company-
says, but it is clearly a threat.
But with foreign-owned companies
now taking such a large role in pesti-
cides and agricultural chemicals, there
is always the prospect that the
Houghton and Byrne business may well
prove a handy vehicle for a foreign
company to develop its business still
further.
The company has, nevertheless, been
something of a disappointment in recent
years. Despite a number of takeovers,
the profits of the past five years have
all been lower than in the four years
1959 to 1962 inclusive. The poorer-
earning rates of the past two years may
justifiably be blamed on unusual
weather conditions in the eastern
States, but the longer-term trend of
earnings has not been exciting.
In the latest term, net profit from
trading and investments made partial
recovery from $69,316 to $76,314, ex-
cluding the $8704 profit on the sale of
assets which had previously been de-
preciated at a rate in excess of that
allowed by the Tax Commissioner.
Bank overdraft rose steeply from
$47,000 to $221,000, and long-term
liabilities of $275,000 (mortgage and
unsecured loans) were created during
the latest year. The current ratio fell
to its lowest level for at least five
years, as trade debtors rose 55 percent
to $381,000, and shocks rose 43 percent
to $451,000, but it is believed that
liquidity has improved significantly
since balance date.
The increases in debtors and stocks
are ascribed by the company to the
acquisition of new companies and the
introduction of new products. Sales
information is not given, except that
sales improved 15 percent in the first
half of 1966-67. Some of the lift in
debtors may be a consequence of a
slowness in accounts, which could be
expected in the rural sector, anyhow.
There are Houghton and Byrne
plants all round Australia.
The amount involved in this capital
expenditure is not divulged, but the
gross value of plant rose over the year
to June by $189,000 and of freehold
land and buildings by $114,000, which
embraces also the takeover of Picca-
ninny the floor polish company. Other
recent takeovers are into making or dis-
tributing disinfectants, detergents, soaps,
and paper products, and crop dusting.
Since listing by a placement in 1955
the company has made no issues to
shareholders, but the share premium
has been utilised in takeovers since
1964, and share premium reserve now
stands at $200,000, about 36 percent
of issued capital. The greatest part of
shareholders’ funds is unappropriated
profits ($723,000), but the reserves are
subject to goodwill on consolidation of
$571,000, and goodwill listed in in-
tangible assets of $202,000.
The company does development
rather than research, assessing new
materials and where they fit in*o the
product range. It sees no real problem
in the fact that a number of insects
develop resistance to certain insecti-
cides, and in the case of a short life
cycle, this may build up quickly. But
the number of insects which survive
are relatively small. For instance, DDT',
the biggest breakthrough in pest con-
trol, is still the most widely used insecti-
cide, with a tremendous number of
applications. It also argues that, despite
the “anti-pollution” publicity, the bene-
ficial effects of its chemicals far out-
weigh their adverse effects.
It is nevertheless developing new pro-
ducts. Several years ago, Samuel Tay-
lor’s Mortein had a near monopoly of
the aerosol-insect-spray business, but in
recent years Houghton and Byrne pro-
ducts have been packed, by contractors,
in aerosol containers. Introduction of
dichlorvos is a major advance. Its
vapor action, which is lacking in
pyrethrum-based sprays, is described as
revolutionary, and it is claimed to kill
insects in remarkably low concentra-
tions. Houghton and Byrne’s dichlorvos
product is Checks All.
If the first half of 1967-68 is shown
to have stood up well against the fairly
good first half of 1966-67, then it augurs
well for a sblid result for the full year,
provided the same sort of seasonal prob-
lems that hit the second half of last
year do not recur. If the December
half year turns out not to have been
very cheerful, the shares could be over-
priced.

Security analysis
Protection down, production up
for Carpet Manufacturers
THE RATE OF GROWTH of carpet-
ing yardage in Australia (production
plus imports) is currently shooting
ahead at about 12 percent annually,
reaching about 1.5 square yards per
head ol population last year. In the
United States during the 19605, the
annual rate of growth has averaged
about 12 percent in dollar shipments.
The apparent annual consumption for
carpeting in the U.S. is now about 2.5
square yards per head of population.
On these figures, Australia still has a
long way to go to catch up with the
Americans.
Possibly about 30 percent of carpet-
ing in Australia is now being bought for
non-residential locations and uses.
Carpets are now being preferred to
smooth floor coverings in multi-storey
office buildings and they could become
important in new markets like schools
and hospitals.
The dramatic growth in carpets has
been in the use of tufteds. Introduced
in the U.S.A. some 20 years ago, tufted
carpets now hold 88 percent of the U.S.
broadloom carpet market, compared to
less than 2 percent each for axminster
and wilton and about 8 percent for
velvet, including chenille and knitted
carpets. In Australia, tufted carpets
were first introduced about ten years
ago, and in 1967 commanded about 40
percent of the total carpeting market.
The balance of the market in 1967
appeared to be shared between
axminster, about 30 percent, wilton,
about 15 percent, and bonded, about 15
percent. Since then sales of bonded
have plummeted heavily, and Minster
Ltd., the producer of Westminster
bonded, must now. be very worried.
Present indications suggest that by 1970
tufted carpets should capture close to
60 percent of the market, which will be
at the almost complete expense of
bonded carpets with some contraction
also in the market share for woven
carpet (axminster and wilton).
The Australian industry owes a lot of
its existence to overseas know-how and
overseas influence is still .very sizable.
There are about 15 local producers
sharing about 70 percent of the avail-
able Australian market supply, and six
of these are subsidiaries of overseas
interests. Imports make up the remain-
ing 30 percent.
Looking at the industry from a point
of maximising profit, as distinct from
being carried away with the sizable
growth forecasts in demand, the main
problem to the investor is to appreciate
the high degree of fragmentation in
the industry—of the 15 Australian pro-
ducers, nine or ten would have indi-
vidual market shares of less than 3 per-
cent each. In a capital intensive
industry, this spells substantial excess
capacity, which is likely to be inten-
sified with the installation of new
machinery.
A recent Tariff Board report implied
that the industry is in need of ration-
alisation to put its house in order, and
in a further jolt the Tariff Board
recommended a reduction of 5 percent
in the tariff on woven wool carpet,
which the Government implemented in
January, 1968. The duty on tufted
carpets was increased by 2\ percent at
the same time.
But the industry claims that since
then devaluation has, in effect, can-
celled this protection and the Depart-
ment of Trade has set up an advisory
panel to investigate the need for emer-
gency “restoration of protection.”
Despite industry problems, investors
should look with favor on one com-
pany, Carpet Manufacturers Ltd., whose
future seems to be well secured. Carpet
Manufacturers was the second com-
pany to produce woven carpets in Aus-
tralia. This was in 1938; they now rank
No. 2 in the industry in dollar sales,
with about ten percent of the total
market supply.
About 30 percent of Carpet Manu-
facturers’ sales is in tufted carpets and
the balance is in axminster. The com-
pany is the only axminster producer
to have a combination of looms, which
are of the spool, gripper, and spool-
gripper types. The company, marketing
under the “Hycraft” and “Lokinvar”
brands, offers all-wool carpeting, mix-
tures of wool (80 percent) and nylon
staple (20 percent), 100 percent nylon
filament, and 100 percent acrylics. Wool
would represent about 60 percent of
the surface fibres used by this manu-
facturer (compared to an average of
only 20 percent in the U.S.A.) and
synthetic fibres make up the balance.
Pure nylon carpets, weight for weight,
wear longer than wool or other fibres,
but the appearance retention does not
stand up well. This is due to the static
electricity which attracts dirt. Acrylics
and some synthetic mixtures have a
better appearance retention than 100
percent nylon, but wool gives the most
luxurious feeling, and Carpet Manu-
facturers report a trend back to wool
in current market demand.
About 15 percent of the company’s
carpet sales are for contract and in-
stitutional customers, and, apart from
less than one percent of sales exported
overseas, the balance of output is sold
through retail and wholesale outlets.
Carpets represent about two-thirds of
group pre-tax profit, whilst the balance
is derived from a 51-percent-owned
subsidiary, Sydney Woollen Mills Ltd.,
which produces carpet yarn and woven
piecegoods for the women’s outerwear
trade.
In Sydney Woollen Mills’ turnover
mix, carpet yarn represents about 60
percent, of which about three-quarters
goes direct to Carpet Manufacturers.
Piecegoods (which are enjoying a bit
of a boom at the moment, with a swing
back to wool in women’s outerwear)
have the remaining 40 percent.
Carpet Manufacturers has its one
carpet factory at Fivedock (Sydney),
with its own sales offices and show-
rooms in Melbourne, Brisbane,
Adelaide, and Perth. Sydney Woollen
Mills has its factory at Parramatta
(Sydney). Both mills work on a two-
shift basis and total group employment
is about 900. Good overseas links are
held with James Templeton and Co.
Ltd. and John Crossley Carpet Traders
(Holdings) Ltd., both of the U.K.,
which jointly hold 42 percent of the
equity, and in tufteds the group rely on
the know-how of Bigelow-Sanford Inc.,
U.S.A., one of the world’s largest
specialist producers of carpeting.

There was a collapse in the com-
pany’s fortunes in 1962, when the
earned for ordinary was down 60 per-
cent on the 1960 peak-profit record,
and even in 1967 the final net profit
result was still about 20 percent below
the 1960 level. This has accounted for
some nervousness in the stock market
and the company’s shares still command
only a very slight market premium.
As a compensating factor, it should be
more widely known that net profit is
struck very conservatively, and by the
end of this current financial year the
whole of the woven carpet plant will
have been entirely written off and will
stand in the books at no cost at all.
In any event, directors reported last
week that parent company profit rose
slightly in the December half year after
steady production and sales, and that
group profit for the year should at
least equal 1966-67’s 16.4 percent earn-
ing rate, provided no adverse economic
conditions develop. They expect to be
able to hold their position despite the
forecast increase in competition from
the U.K. and New Zealand following
devaluation.
SUMMARY: At current prices, the
$1 shares are selling for the equivalent
of seven year’s earnings at only $1.15
to show a dividend yield of 8.7 percent-
This is putting far too low a price on
this company’s future potential.

by Peter Boxall
Eastern's Regional Manager
Had some people in last week
wanting the full story on our routes
from St. Louis to the West Coast,
U.S.A.
“Exciting new gateways from the
Pacific,” I told them, “operating
from last June. We fly Seattle-St.
Louis and return three times daily,
also Portland-St. Louis twice a day.
Non-stop, by Boeing 727.”
“Tell us more,” they asked.
“Well, Seattle was World’s Fair
centre in ’62,” I said. “You can
ride a ferry across Puget Sound,
visit any of 888 restaurants and
night spots, boat, fish, shop for
anything from curios to caftans in
old Pike’s Place Market ...” “And
Portland?” they queried.
“The city of roses! Spring all
year round. Historic and scenic
... a great sport centre. Take a
camera if you go during their
October Rodeo.”
“And from either, Eastern can
connect you to 95 cities from
Montreal to Miami, Mexico to the
Bahamas,” I added.
Eastern sure opens up the States
to trans-Pacific travellers. Why
don’t you try them on your next
trip stateside?
See how much better

Mining
Hazards of fragmented equities
amongst the oil rigs
CRITICS OF OVERSEAS investment
in the Australian mining industry never
seem to have worried overmuch about
the high level of foreign investment in
our oil exploration industry.
There are good reasons for this state
of affairs, particularly in regard to
leases covering offshore areas. The ex-
penditure involving an offshore drilling
rig can run into tens of millions of dol-
lars a year when the Interstate Oil-
Shell rig encountered trouble anchor-
ing over its drilling site in Bass Strait
early last year, the work entailed in
drilling the seabed and setting concrete
moorings cost over a million dollars.
And this was before any drilling could
be done on the structure, which has
since proved dry. With up to 12 rigs
expected to be operating in offshore
areas during the rest of this year, it is
highly unlikely that this sort of money
would be found locally, and it is not
surprising that local companies have
elected to hive off a large part of their
equity in potential areas in exchange
for the finance and expertise of over-
seas operators like Shell and Esso.
While these developments have
narrowed the odds, it may be asked
whether resources have now been
spread so thin that the rewards are
likely to be too small to be attrac-
tive, albeit rather more certain. In
many cases the result is not too unfav-
orable in spite of the fragmentation of
leases which has occurred. For
example, Ampol Exploration owns
only one-seventh of West Australian
Petroleum Pty. Ltd. (WAPET), the
company which does the actual ex-
ploration while overseas companies own
the remaining 6/7ths of WAPET’S
capital; the actual agreement, however,
provides that each of the partners in
WAPET owns a portion of the actual
production of oil and they do not
have to wait for dividends. Thus,
Ampol Exploration actually owns one-
seventh of the oil flowing out of
Barrow Island and has been earning
profits from the moment the first
barrel of oil was sold to the refiners.
A conservative estimate of reserves at
Barrow is about 120 million barrels,
so Ampol Exploration owns some 17
million barrels worth in the vicinity
of $4B million. Costs of extraction will
be in the range of $l4 million, leaving
a net income of $34 million before tax
to be earned over the eight years which
it will take to extract the oil at the
30,000 barrel per day rate which is
expected to be reached in the near
future. Against this net income of
$34 million the market places a value
of $72 million on the company’s
33 million shares.
Ampol Exploration’s one-seventh
interest compares with the one-fifth
interest held by Australian Oil & Gas
Corporation in its older oil field at
Moonie. This field has been estimated
to contain some 50 million barrels of
oil and for convenience AOG’s share
can be put at 10 million barrels (in
practice AOG does not itself own one-
fifth of the oil, but 1 /sth of the profits,
and it is receiving part of these profits
in advance through the payment of a
royalty of 13J cents per barrel). The
Moonie field is being depleted over
twenty years and over the remainder
of its life should produce at least 41
million barrels. If AOG receives no
more than the 13 J cents a barrel, its
total income (before tax) will be in
the vicinity of $5.5 million. With each
of its 7.7 million shares standing at
$l.BO, the market value of AOG is less
than $14,000,000 that is some 21-
times the total income estimated
above. Production from Alton will add
to this by a small amount and bring
the multiple to a figure remarkably
close to that obtained in the case of
Ampol Exploration which works out
at 2.1 times
If this apparent agreement on valua-
tion is more than coincidence it may
serve as a standard in attempting to
place a value on companies yet to be
successful in establishing commercial
oil reservoirs. There are, of course,
obvious complications of transport
costs, flow rates and price, which,
although set at about $2.80 at the
present, may be subject to revision if
and when we have found oil fields
sustaining production in, excess of our
current consumption. Bearing these
factors in mind it is still possible to
have a look at what would happen
assuming the establishment of a field
containing say, 100 million barrels of
oil by one or two not-yet-successful
companies. A price of about $2.50
per barrel less costs of some 75 cents
can be used to arrive at a likely gross
profit figure (ignoring tax) of $175
million. The multiplier of about
twice can then be applied to these
earnings.
For example, Oil Search has
farmed-out its areas to Esso and
British Petroleum and in effect has
now a 25 percent and a 50 percent
interest respectively in areas being
prospected by these two companies.
Taking the area of greatest interest
at the moment, that to be drilled by


Esso would leave Oil Search with 25
percent of the postulated profit figure
of $175 million, which equals
$43,750,000. Twice this figure is $87.5
million equivalent to $2.30 on each of
Oil Search’s 38.3 million shares—but
only if and when Esso has proved up
a reservoir containing 100 million
barrels of oil.
The local companies interested in
current drilling on the Ashmore Reef,
Woodside and Mid-Eastern, have a 25
percent and an 8 l-3rd percent interest
respectively in the structure. Again,
assuming the establishment of a 100
million barrel field, Woodside’s 25 per-
cent interest would be $43,750,000 to
give a valuation of $87.5 million,
equivalent to $3 per Woodside share
(there are 29 million shares issued),
while Mid-Eastern’s share comes to
$14.5 million to give a valuation of
$29 million, equivalent to $1.45 on
each of that company’s 20 million
shares. These rule of thumb estimates
are perhaps too simple, but they do
show that in spite of the considerable
fragmentation which has taken place in
the equity of local oil companies in
exploration areas, the rewards are still
sufficiently attractive for those com-
panies which have at least a working
interest in prospective acreage. The
position is rather different for those
companies which have elected to take
a simple royalty on production, especi-
ally in those cases where a maximum
figure has been placed on such royalties.

SHARE YIELDS
AND STATISTICS
Opener for the week was the WMC share split and rights
issue. In an uncertain market, the old shares lost nearly $1
on theoretical ex rights price of $B.BO, but the rights ended
the week nearer expectations. The tax advantage of the rights,
and the smaller initial outlay favored the rights to new shares,
rather than the old. BHP, despite good news from Kingfish,
sold as low as $17.55, finishing almost a dollar down for the
week. One of the heaviest losers in the recent shakeout on the
stock exchanges, Tliiess picked up, but takeover bidders CRA
and CBA lost ground.

Copulate and Perish
FIFTY YEARS of research by
Government scientists has failed to pro-
duce any big sticks with which to beat
the Australian sheep blowfly. At long
last, however, a new era in fly control
may be dawning. CSIRO entomologists
have outlined a variation of the classical
sterile-male method of control that
could give this pest what-oh.
They propose to release swarms of
booby-trapped flies among unsuspecting
wild populations. Only a couple of
laboratory scale experiments have been
carried out as yet, but they have
yielded encouraging support for the
belief that the booby-trap method
would be feasible on a large scale.
Theoretically, at any rate, the method
should be fully translatable to the field,
because the blowfly concerned, Lucilia
Cuprina, possesses all the necessary
biological characteristics to enable the
technique to work in practice. The
concept of using sexual sterility to
annihilate certain species of insect
pests originated in the mind of E. F.
Knipling, an American entomologist, in
the mid-19305. After a long series of
laboratory and small-field trials, his
idea was finally put to practical use in
1959 in a spectacular eradication cam-
paign against the flesh-eating screw-
worm, Cochliomyia Hominivorax, the
larva of a fly that looks somewhat like
our Pretty Lucy and persecutes cattle
and other animals throughout Central
America and the south-east of the
U.S.A. Within four years this pest was
all but eliminated from Texas and the
neighboring States.
Presumably, the costs of a similar
assault on the sheep blowfly would not
be charged to the Australian wool-
grower. In this way, our hard-
pressed wool industry could obtain very
considerable financial assistance in a
form which the taxpayer would prob-
ably not regard as an intolerable sub-
sidy. A few years ago the Bureau of
Agricultural Economics estimated that
the blowfly could not be costing the
sheep industry less than $2O million a
year. Probably the real cost would be
much higher than this, as the Bureau’s
estimate was derived from assessable
losses and expenditures and did not in-
clude allowances for such imponderables
as the loss of lambs from fly-struck
mothers.
Besides, the booby-trap method of
controlling the blowfly should not be
inherently as costly as the sterile-male
method of controlling the screw-fly.
Reinvasion need not be a difficulty
here and the Australian blowfly is much
easier to rear artificially in mass num-
bers than the screw-fly. Moreover, the
blowfly is very promiscuous and so one
fly suitably booby-trapped can destroy
many mates, whereas in the case of
the screw-fly the female does not
actively assist the campaign. In the
laboratory experiments at Canberra,
each female killed up to a hundred
males. Curiously, when the situation
was reversed and the males were booby-
trapped, the kill of females was not
nearly so great. After all, it takes

These days a pack can be as important as
the product. Hair shampoos for instance.
Silvikrin made a fine product but, to
really compete, the pack had to work too.
The big worry was impact strength. Wet,
soapy hands and hard tile floors don’t go
with fragile containers. This meant the pack
had to be really tough. But it also had
to look good, you had to be able to see the
product and it had to look modern, clean,
and fashionable. All this and still be eco-
j nomically competitive with the existing
\ methods.
The answer came from Duranol who had
been experimenting with new PVC
materials. They decided on a Geon
compound because it gave the best
balance of high impact strength,
excellent clarity, and moderate cost.
Silvikrin is now competing success-
fully in the fast moving shampoo
market on a national scale.

two to tango. Finally, the population
of blowflies is disproportionally sparse,
though this may not seem so in view
of the .extent of the damage caused.
Nevertheless, careful counts have shown
that even in bad fly seasons there are
usually not more than five flies to the
acre.
The CSIRO scientists believe that
it should be possible to load flies with
a non-lethal dose of sterilising chemical.
This would not only destroy the car-
rier’s capacity, if female, to lay viable
eggs, or, if male, to fertilise a female,
but have a like effect on all those that
attempted to mate with it. Alterna-
tively, flies could be dabbed with an
insecticide to which they have become
resistant and then released among a
wild population that had not yet
developed resistance to the particular
chemical. For example, the fly in some
regions of New South Wales and
Queensland is now able to tolerate the
organo-phosphorous insecticides which
were introduced about ten years ago to
replace the DDT family of chemicals,
to which the flies had also developed
resistance. However, in other States,
OP tolerance has not been reported as
yet. But this tactic need not be limited
to natural opportunities. Resistant
strains can be created deliberately by
repeatedly exposing a confined popula-
tion to a certain poison.
Another appealing advantage of the
booby-trap method suggested by
entomologists M. J. Whitten and K. R.
Norris when they “patented” their idea
by means of a note in the international
science journal “Nature” is that it does
not put humans, the sheep, or other
useful forms of life in danger from
toxic residues. Their method elegantly
meets the criteria of care in the use of
pesticides called for by Miss Carson in
her famous book “The Silent Spring.”
Obviously, their method obviates the
dreary round of jetting and mustering;
in fact, it would relieve the grazier of
virtually all the work of fly control. He
might only need to concern himself
with mopping-up operations. It is to
be hoped in view of all this that Whit-
ten and Norris can get all the support
they will need to get their ambitious
scheme on the road.
The only other anti-blowfly news to
be announced lately illustrates another
point in favor of a high-stocking
policy. Fifteen years ago scientists at
the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry,
Canberra, observed that the incidence
of fly stroke was proportional to the
amount of dry pasture present. Up to
44 percent of sheep on tall, dense pas-
ture suffered fly strike, but none were
struck on pasture that had been heavily
grazed or cut for hay. This important
little fact was released in last month’s
issue of the Australian Veterinary
Journal. One wonders why it should
have been suppressed so long and
whether there are many more such tit-
bits hidden in the research notebooks
and awaiting economic exploitation.


ARTS AND
ENTERTAINMENT
Facing fearful odds
TIM BURSTALL talks to PHILLIP ADAMS
WHAT ARE USUALLY described as
“boyish good looks” conceal both Tim
Burstall’s 40 years and his single-
mindedness. Long celebrated among
the “Eltham arties” (that community
of aging flower people who live twixt
mud-brick, Breughel prints, and stone-
ware pottery), Burstall is nothing if
not purposeful. This is evidenced by
the fact that, against almost infinite
odds, he is now directing Australia’s
first fully professional locally financed
feature film in almost 20 years. And
if that wasn’t improbable enough, it’s
no B-feature, but a broadly auto-
biographical film along Fellini lines.
Here Burstall describes his contrast-
ing experiences in the Australian and
American film industries, and discusses
the background of “Two Thousand
Weeks”:
The first job I got when I left uni-
versity was appraising all the films
entering Australia for the National
Film Library. At the same time they
were collecting archive material of early
Australia. Forced to look at that stuff
all day long gave me a hearty hatred
of documentary.
What I wanted to do at that time was
go to the Department of Information’s
film unit. I had it lined up with Stan-
ley Hawes, but then Menzies got in
and made noises about scrapping the
whole outfit. They’d seemed to many
people to be peddling an old-fashioned
socialist line, so he was absolutely right
to consider it. The way things looked,
there didn’t seem to be much of a
future there.
Instead I did an MA, and built a
house at Eltham on the grant. I did
my thesis on Dos Passos because as a
Marxist and a Joycean he interested
me very much. A year later I took a
fill-in job doing public relations with
the Antarctic Division and I stayed on
there for quite a while, as it gave me
time to write and follow my other
interests.
Earlier on I’d acted with Beresford
Fowler’s group when he had people
like Ray Lawler and Wynn Roberts
with him. In 1957 I got interested in
acting again and did a few plays with
Peter O’Shaughnessy. About the same
time I became mates with a fashion
photographer called Gerard Vander-
berg. (He’s since become an important
movie cameraman in Europe.) We
decided to make a film at weekends,
but nothing much hung on it. I’d been
impressed with a film called “Crin
blanc,” made by Lamourisse who
did “The Red Balloon.” I liked his
idea of using kids as actors for three
important reasons: they were cheap,
available, and people were less likely
to make invidious comparisons when
the actors were children.
Before we began the film we studied
“Crin blanc” and worked out how
they’d done the shots. It took a lot of
part-time work but finally we got an
opus in the can. But we needed some
money for the editing, music, and final
processing. That’s when Pat Ryan came
into the picture. He was an old school
friend interested in film. He put some
money in and took the finished job to
Venice. It was called “The Prize” and
Producer Tim Bur stall overshadows the leading players in his film “Two Thousand
Weeks," Jeame Drynan and Mark McManus PHOTOGRAPH BY MARK STIZIC
actually won one a bronze medallion.
This persuaded Screen Gems to dub
it into Icelandic and Spanish and so
on and it did quite well in the U.S.A.
and Europe.
Next we formed Eltham Films and
made a few films on painters Nolan,
Boyd, Roberts. Meanwhile, I wrote a
script for a feature film on Ned Kelly
and we tried to raise the production
budget locally.
Selecting Kelly seemed a good idea.
It involved action of a pretty extra-
ordinary and slightly fairy-tale sort and
there wasn’t very much dialogue needed.
(One actor who read the script said,
“Gees, the bloody thing’s a mime”).
The demands it made on actors were
minimal. Kelly’s very visual the
figure in the landscape . . . armor . . .
chases . . . the burning of the pub . . .
cops and robbers and Robin Hood.
Plus the bonus of Australiana and
picturesque landscape. It was very
attractive in those terms but had noth-
ing to do with all that stuff about the
Australian myth.
To me the Kelly story is an inside-
out Western. That is, in the standard
Western like “High Noon” you begin
with the lawless town, into which comes
a law-abiding hero to straighten things
out. Now, with Kelly it’s just the oppo-
site. What happens in Australia is that
not one bloke but a whole lawless gang
come into a law-abiding town and raise
hell. Yes, they get captured in the
end but they remain the heros.
We managed to raise half the $50,000
we needed, and the Commonwealth
Development Bank was going to give
us the rest. But their terms! They
wanted a lien on all our films and gear
and even the Emerald Hill Theatre,
which was owned by our company.
This was far too steep. But money
wasn’t the only problem. We soon
learnt that there wasn’t the beginning
of the film industry to help us. Some
studios made commercials and some
made documentaries, but there wasn’t
the proper connection between theatre
and cinema. Nor were there any dis-
tributors to appeal to. The Metro and


Greater Union people are just office
boys for overseas interests.
An overseas company offered to buy
the script, and after I declined they
brought out their own version. Karel
Reisz was going to direct it with Albert
Finney in the lead, but it didn’t come
off. However, I hear they’re still inter-
ested and might do it. After the attempt
to float Kelly locally I tried to float it
as a co-production, with the idea of
bringing in an English director and lead.
However, it became very clear that
that way I would lose all control. The
English won’t invest unless they’ve got
control. They have to dominate, as they
did with the “Weird Mob.”
The only work I could get was mak-
ing some more films on art and some
kids’ films for the ABC. Then the
Commonwealth Film Unit offered me
a children’s feature, and while I didn’t
like being type-cast what else was
there? I was set on the Nullarbor and
started off as a one-hour film. I was
very pleased with it. The rough-cut at
52 minutes was superb. Then the whole
bit began with committees. Not content
with merely mucking around with
details, they started to modify the whole
story line.
For instance, we had a scene with a
boy in jail and that had to go as it was
considered poor PR for Australia. Then
the idea of a Nullarbor location itself
fell out of favor, as some bright boy
said it was negative, image-wise. They
wanted to put a shot of Perth and
Adelaide at the front of the film so as
to apologise for all the sand in between.
What with one thing and another the
film began to shrink, and at each chop
it was damaged more and more. They
kept taking out whole bits of the plot,
so I almost took my name off the
credits. I think I should have. I felt
very sick. Now the damn thing runs
35 minutes.
I had roughly the same experience
with the ABC over the Sebastian &
Fox series. This was a kids’ series using
puppets and live actors and having
bought it they withdrew three or four
episodes. One was on the bomb and
had Russia and America depicted in
much the same terms in relation to it.
I called them Crusher and Hysterica.
They wouldn’t have a bar of that.
So it was quite clear that I’d have
to go it alone minus Government
departments. Fortunately, I got a
Harkness Fellowship to America, which
was tremendously exciting. I was able to
work in an industry where ideas were
worth money and people weren’t afraid
of them. They actually liked them. I
worked in New York and Los Angeles
television, and made a couple of films in
New York myself. One of them was
called “Blues from the Jungle,” and
was about Black Power. It’ll probably
appear on the ABC. As well I did a
version of “Krapp’s Last Tape,” by
Beckett, which was put on an educa-
tional channel.
I also went to Strasberg’s Actors
Studio, which has turned out people
like Anne Bancroft, Brando, Shelley
Winters, and so on. It’s been the biggest
single influence on theatre in the past
50 years and its contribution in pro-
ducing screen actors is unrivalled. Their
concept of internalising emotion works
against theatricality, which is no damn
good on the screen. Anyway, I worked
with a lot of leading people, putting on
pieces of my own. However, the Actors’
Studio is now the Establishment, so
afterwards I teamed up with the Open
Theatre people, who are much more
avant garde.
There’s so much going on in New
York you just can’t begin to keep up
with it. I went out every night for six
months and couldn’t even keep up with
cinematic experiment, let alone
theatre, related fields like painting,
poetry readings, folk-singing, and the
rest. But one did begin to see the con-
nection between these things. You could
see the relationships between under-
ground cinema and theatrical
improvisation and Happenings and art
not forgetting the drug cult. The
notion of experience over the inter-
pretation of experience is very import-
ant. You can read Susan Sontag and
the rest, but no amount of reading is
the same as experiencing it at first hand.
Melbourne and Sydney and parti-
cularly Melbourne are so narrow
and puritanical. Here, culture is rather
like Philadelphia or Manchester in
terms of outlook and response. Sure,
there are growing points here, and if
one knows the direction where things
are moving it can be all right.
After New York I wrote off to 24
good film directors seeking permission
to work with them. Fortunately both
Kazan and Martin Ritt said OK, so
I worked on Ritt’s “Hombre” with Paul
Newman and Diane Cilento. Ritt isn’t
one of my favorite directors but he’s
pretty good.
My favorite directors? The usual
ones. The standard choices. I like some
Godard, although I don’t believe in
the notion of randomness. I’m all for
the pattern being lyrical and spon-
taneous, but a lot of Godard bores me.
I’m partial to early Truffaut, but now
he’s gone to pot. I go for Fellini
rather heavily. I go for the English
directors like Clayton. But then again
I don’t think in terms of directors. I
consider that there’s a lot of bull talked
about directors,
Anyone who’s worked in a big film
knows that film isn’t an individualistic
art like the novel. It’s a social art like
ballet or theatre, and depends on the
talent of a vast number of people. The
director, actors, cameramen, editor
they’re all important. But if there’s one
person who is the key to success, it’s
the writer.
But no one hears about writers. It’s
all directors, directors. Just as in the
1930 s one only heard about stars. Then
came the directors and next it’ll be
writers. People talk about “Darling”
as being by Schlesinger, or “Morgan”
being by Karel Reisz, “Two for" the
Road” by some other . guy. But all
three films were written by Frederick
Raphael. Similarly all the early Kramer
films were written by Carl Foreman.
And Zavattini was more important to
the Italian neo-realist cinema than
de Sica. Whenever de Sica made films
with Zavattini they were great, and
when he worked on his own the results
were disastrous.
When I got back to Australia, Pat
Ryan and I started planning another
feature, and, using a trick I’d learnt in
the States, we began talking our obses-
sions into a tape-recorder. All sorts of
things. Is it worth staying in Aus-
tralia? Or is it a worthless puddle?
Things about the relationships between
children and their parents at crisis
point. Questions of morality and death.
How do we conduct love affairs?
Friendships? The emigre thing. The
script grew out of reels of tape.
Eltham Films formed a company with
Senior Films, a big Melbourne studio
who make commercials and documen-
taries. You could say that we’ll provide
the artistic direction and they’ll pro-
vide the technical facilities and crew.
They’re got a brilliant cameraman,
Rob Copping, who I consider the best
Producer Tim Burstall with Harold
Koch, his assistant cameraman
in Australia. Between us we’ve put up
all the money for the production
enough to give us a bigger crew than
Bergman. He uses between eight and
12 and we’ll have 13.
“Two Thousand Weeks” is 40 years.
It’s what time you’ve got left when
you’re 30. It’s the most powerful way
of making that point I can think of.
Months aren’t as dramatic, nor are
days. We think in weeks.
The themes are roughly in this order.
The hero is wondering whether his
commitment to his marriage and his
job and his country are real. The
crisis involves a love affair, a triangle.
He is a newspaperman whose father is
dying. His boss feels that his writing
shows he’s lost patience with his readers.
He wants to be creative so we touch
on the Great Australian Novel. We
look at adultery and the enigma of his


marriage. There’s lots of flashbacks —
to Geelong Grammar, a childhood fight
with his father, and so on.
The actors are getting paid way above
awards. We screen-tested the lot. Mark
McManus is the lead, and a Sydney
girl called Jeanie Drynan is his mistress.
Eileen Chapman plays the wife. David
Turnbull’s got a big part. Michael Duf-
field is the father. So far the shooting’s
going well. Anyway, we’ll all know
when it’s shown —in about four
months’ time.
Art
Fastidious four
By ELWYN LYNN
Yvonne Audette, paintings and draw-
ings. Kym Bonython’s, Sydney.
Robert Klippel, sculpture. Kym Bony-
thon’s, Sydney.
George Haynes, paintings. Watters
Gallery, Sydney.
Lloyd Rees, watercolors. Macquarie
Galleries, Sydney.
APART from a whisper of the ex-
pressionist Sibley-Whiteley out-of-focus
look in Haynes and a rare aggressive-
ness in Klippel, a fastidious restraint
prevailed with the above foursome,
most tender being Rees and Miss
Audette, whose show of 63 works,
covering a decade from 1958, makes no
concessions to the avant garde
audience, for it subtly and irrefutably
restates the case for that emerging,
flimsy calligraphy, that tenuous separ-
ation of line from form that marked
an abstraction based on Cezanne, but,
as with John Passmore in this country,
alert to the spontaneity and automatism
of action-painting. Living in Italy from
1958 to 1965, Miss Audette has natur-
ally been influenced by Italian finesse
and poise and, in some gouaches, one
might find a trace of Novelli’s graffiti,
but Klee is her fount of wisdom.
Of course, Miss Audette’s method of
working doesn’t account for what we
see, which are fluctuating surfaces
swarming with signs, some floating to
the surface, some sinking from sight,
some in happy confluence, others sfi
separated that tensions become more
leisurely. Santa Maria Maggiore and
Chinese Poem, both done in 1963 and
as good as anything in this manner in
Australia, exemplify her penchant for
dream-like palimpsests, but palimpsests
where the partly erased script is as
important as the surface notations.
All this must disturb the modern
structuralists who want to see only posi-
tive forms: bleached, shadowy, indeter-
minate, disparate patches and tentative
gestures fall through the palest yellow
of the 1967 Wheel of Life; Klee had
an answer to those who want a defini-
tive severity: “Vagueness in one’s work
is therefore only permissible when there
Robert Klippel at work in his studio
PHOTOGRAPH BY ROBERT WALKER
is a real inner need, a need which could
explain the use of colored or very pale
lines, or the application of further
vagueness such as the shades of grey
ranging from yellow to blue.” Miss
Audette must be the most anti-
psychedelic colorist and most intro-
verted painter around. Even in her two
warm-brown, romantic pieces, Machine
for Sharpening Knives and Child’s War
Machine, the tone is subdued and, des-
pite the titles, most unaggressive.
She seems to be moving to a less
divisionist approach, for in Deep Sea
Fishing of 1967, despite its dashes of
green, orange, and yellow, there is
more repose and a more placid world
is growing beneath the surface.
An additional pleasure in the show
are the drawings and collages which
remind us that no artist was born yes-
terday.
Klippel, who regards his art as con-
stantly looking at his yesterday and
tomorrow, is now more monolithic in
his cast-bronze pieces, and even his
assemblages are less dispersed and less
delicately fragile. Movements are more
abrupt and rarely neutralised by gentler
contours, but a restrained self-
sufficiency prevails. The catalogue
photograph of unredeemed junk sug-
gests that we might be getting a brutal
Stankiewicz or the simple found-objects
of Colla, who haunts Italian junk-
yards, but Klippel’s found-pieces lose
their association with adventitious junk-
piles and sink their identities in the
moulded bronze. Blocky and tough as
some are, they still reveal Klippel’s
fastidiousness, though No. 8 (21in. high,
$500) has a torpedo-like flowerpod
jutting from a cylinder that grows long,
emaciated antennae. There is, too, a
new interest in serialisation (a new in-
word) of similar forms as in No. 12’s
ascending metal ovals.
This is splendid domestic sculpture
(31 pieces, 9 to 27in. high, $6OO to
$1200) that is tough and positive in
form but tender enough in effect, a
slight awkwardness here and there re-
moving any sense of fastidiousness.
When George Haynes, a Western Aus-
tralian having his first show in the East,
is awkward he is best, for, despite influ-
ences of Phillip Sutton, the scented-
salon Matisse, and Wilhelm May, he
still reveals his former concern with ex-
pressionism’s angst as in the fine dark-
green head of a painter on purple and
in Sunday Morning, where a bilious
ochre nude pulls on a green sock. But
too often, as in Summertime I, with a
loose, patchy figure melting below a
red-orange sky, he is a tamed Fauve. A
glance at Rex shows that he has bene-
fited from a look at de Kooning’s use
of space, as has Diebenkorn, who is
possibly an influence. It was a good
debut, but Mr. Playnes is divided be-
tween a love of loose, lyrical, feathery-
edged color patches, especially in his
abstracts, and bitter-sweet color as reve-
latory of moods and character. At pre-
sent he’s better when his color is not
independent, but that’s no prescription
for his assured future.
Lloyd Rees is a veteran whose future
is not behind him even if his 41 water-
colors of Italy, Greece, France, and
Majorca are nostalgic mementoes; the
best have a grey, gossamer, fragile,
faded suggestiveness as though they were
spectral emanations of places and times
long ago; a few swell with large, yet
paradoxically flimsy, forms, and Tuscan
Hills I, with fleeting blue stains, has
the rhythmical panoramas for which
Rees is justly celebrated. Some of the
washes are too sweetly delicate and
some scenes too intent on mere locality,
but the staccato, sketchy touches in
The Tuscan Landscape, the speckled,
cobwebbed forms in The Terraced
Landscape 2, and the black accents of
trees in the rolling Tuscan Farmlands I
evoke that universality that informs the
significant work of our most neglected
landscape painter.


Opera
Dramatic difficulty
By JOHN SMALL
Tannhauser, The Magic Flute. Eliza-
bethan Opera Company Canberra
Theatre.
THE NEW PRODUCTION of “Tann-
hauser” with which the Trust opened
its 1968 season in Canberra last week
is an impressive achievement musi-
cally solid, splendidly set and produced,
and well acted throughout. So impres-
sive is it that one could easily remain
unaware of the dramatic defects in the
work, and overlook the difficulties that
a producer has to contend with in
making it work onstage.
The main problem springs from the
fact that the two leading women,
Venus and the saintly Elizabeth, are
never developed as three-dimensional
characters. Their function is simply to
represent the abstractions between
which Tannhauser is torn religion,
duty and so on, on the one hand, and
sensuality and all that on the other.
Tannhauser is portrayed exclusively in
terms of this issue, so that his char-
acter, too, lacks depth. Moreover, the
issue itself is hard for a modern audi-
ence to take as solemnly as Wagner’s
contemporaries apparently did. These
difficulties are compounded by Wag-
ner’s apparently invincible belief that
no scene by him, however drawn out,
could ever possibly be too long.
Stephan Beinl’s production conceals
or surmounts these problems very ef-
fectively. Apart from a couple of
passages where the action simply cannot
be got moving at an acceptable pace,
Beinl’s meticulous and intelligent
direction of the cast gives the breath
of dramatic life to an opera whose
commitment to dramatic values is often
less than complete. Beinl is assisted by
Kenneth Rowell’s elegant and service-
able sets, which fit in perfectly with
the style and pace of the production.
Musically, the production is naturally
not yet at its best. Some fine singing
and playing in some passages is offset
by minor uncertainties in pitch, timing,
and balance in some of the larger
ensembles, some of the principals
appeared to be affected by nerves, and
the orchestra was sometimes far from
precise.
“The Magic Flute” is, in its way, even
more concerned with abstractions than
Tannhauser, for it is an allegory of the
ideals of the Masonic lodges of
the late 18th century wisdom, justice,
enlightenment and the brotherhood of
man. It is, however, better adapted to
the stage than the later work, partly
because the drama focuses clearly on
the characters instead of the abstrac-
tions behind them, partly because it also
contains a liberal amount of popular
Viennese comedy. The Trust production
seems to have been less intensively
rehearsed than “Tannhauser,” and has
not yet come good dramatically,
though there is some excellent singing
from the principals Robert Gard and
Rosemary Gordon.
Music
Grave loss
By PAUL FROLICH
MOST SYDNEY music-lovers were
grieved to learn of the resignation of
Harry Curby, the first violin, from
the Sydney String Quartet. This group,
the first permanent resident string
quartet to be appointed to the N.S.W.
Conservatorium of Music, had a very
fruitful two seasons; there seems little
prospect of its continuing as success-
fully, no matter who joins it.
The Sydney Mozart Society opened
its 1968 season with an evening of
chamber music by Haydn and Mozart,
which demonstrated the seriousness of
the gap left by Mr. Curby’s departure.
For the occasion, the remaining three
members of the Quartet were joined by
a fine young viola player, John Hard-
ing, and Robert Pikler, leader now in
name as well as in fact, once again
took up the violin. Mr. Pikler had a
deservedly high reputation as a violinist,
but the past two decades saw him build-
ing an even greater reputation as a
violist.
Some minor lapses of intonation—
and they were few—were not them-
selves a calamity, but they were a
symptom of the fact that all was not
well. Mr. Pikler has always held that
the heart of every fine work is in its
slow sections and the loving attention
he lavished on the slow movements was
rewarded by some truly enchanted
moments. The Andante of Mozart’s
Divertimento K. 136 had the serious
wistfulness and emotional overtones that
distinguish many of his later works.
Likewise, the Adagio cantabile in
Haydn’s “Lark” Quartet, opus 64 No.
5, was played with fine romantic fervor
and beautiful tone.
The things that did not succeed were,
of course, richly offset by much that
did. Haydn’s almost unknown Quartet
in E flat, opus 64 No. 6 was revealed
as a lovely work, particularly in the
final movement with its delightful
Landler theme and there were some
very happy moments in the Menuet
of the “Lark.” The finest music of
the evening, an,d the best performance,
came with the last work, Mozart’s
Clarinet Quintet. In this, Messrs. Pik-
ler, Ingram, Harding, and Painter were
joined by young wind-player Pamela
Johnson. Miss Johnson produces a
smallish, but sweet and well-controlled
sound and she blended excellently with
the strings.
Films
Hardy perennial
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Far from the Madding Crowd. Direc-
tor, John Schlesinger. t
To Sir, With Love. Director, Tames
Clavell.
STRANGE TO COMPLAIN that a
screen version of a novel is too faith-
ful! Director Schlesinger and script-
writer Frederic Raphael cleave rever-
ently to the story-line of Hardy’s novel
they’re quite unimaginatively true
to the letter of the original, without
showing a gleam of understanding of or
feeling for its spirit.
Hardy, long-winded and didactic as
he is, is still a major, though largely
unread, novelist, and “Far from the
Madding Crowd” still has power,
humanity, and a bucolic charm despite
its verbosity. Its four main characters—
the intensely female Bathsheba and the
men who love her in their different ways
are valid and real; the irrationality
and sometimes violence of their
behaviour springs from their natures.
Hardy conveys this by the sound and
simple literary device of telling us
directly their thoughts and feelings.
Since this can’t be done in a movie,
it’s up to the scriptwriter to insert
dialogue or action that explains their
actions. But Raphael has been too
frightened to meddle with a classic to
do this, and we’re presented with an
often mystifying series of’ incidents in
which people behave without any
apparent emotional or intellectual
reason.
Julie Christie and Terence Stamp,
both acceptable players of mod charac-
ters, are utterly at sea here. Peter
Finch and Alan Bates manage a good
deal better, and both bring dignity and
even a modicum of conviction to their
roles.
Of course, the film’s main, basic fault
is that it’s damned dull; and, little as
I approve of the mutilation of films
after they’ve left the director’s hands,
I felt a sneaking relief that 13 minutes
had been “edited” (not cut, the dis-
tributors insist) from this one.
The innate dishonesty of “To Sir,
With Love” is the more glaring for
our having comparatively recently
.seen, in “Up The Down Staircase,” a
clear-eyed and unsentimental study of
the problems of the teacher. “To Sir,
With Love” ends in a warm glow of
unreality, with all problems solved and
only the words “happy ever after”
missing.
Sidney Poitier plays a new teacher
at an East End school. Assigned a
class full of teenage mavericks, it takes
him little time—mainly by throwing
away the syllabus and teaching them
about “life” —to have them eating out
of his hand.
There isn’t enough originality in

Perth Festival
Discrepancies
By DUNCAN GRAHAM
ONE OF MANY complaints made
against the W.A. University-controlled
Festival of Perth is that it has no theme:
this year’s could be called a festival
of discrepancies. The theme was set in
the first week with the excellent
“Richard III” and the indifferent
“Halloran’s Little Boat,” and continued
in the second and third weeks with
“Moon on a Rainbow Shawl” and
“Staircase.”
“Moon,” Errol John’s 11-year-old
West Indian play, dated but still a
fine story, was acted by a local com-
pany that included the impeccable Nita
Pannell in her 1960 Adelaide Festival
role as Sophie Adams and a group
of amateurs who tried hard. Conversely,
Charles Dyer’s rewritten “Staircase,”
presented by St. Martin’s Theatre
Company in the Perth Playhouse
(director George Fairfax), was first-
class theatre fare. This funny-sad play
about two retrospecting, philosophising
homosexual barbers who reach a crisis
in their relationship when one is charged
with masquerading as a woman never
offends, though it skates on thin ice
throughout.
Melbourne actors Sydney Conabere
and John Frawley, despite some first-
night delivery troubles, kept the pace
moving hard and fast. There must have
been few in the audience who did not
feel sympathetically sad a situation
that speaks highly for the play and the
two actors performing in brash,
masculine, still parochial Perth.
A collection of Scandinavian design
was opened last week in the impossible
environment of the W.A. Art Gallery
hot, ancient, spaceless. The gallery
is scheduled to be rebuilt in the 19705.
The professional exhibition of house-
hold furniture and utensils is, aestheti-
cally, everything we expect in Nordic
design. The nearest Australian equiva-
lent would probably be a collection of
plastic kitchen settings and folding
aluminium garden chairs. But at least
our goods are usually functional.
When the exhibition comes your way
and it is well worth seeing look
for a thirst-size balloon glass with a
micro-mini base, and a long stemmed
liqueur glass with a dinner-plate base.
Anyone for Australian design?
Theatre
Sweet dreaming
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Thieves’ Carnival. Anouilh. Viaduct
Theatre Club, Melbourne.
I SHALL KEEP the details of my life
to myself, Anouilh decided many years
ago, to the considerable benefit of his
mystique. He’s considered the hardest
man in France to interview and by all
accounts it’s easier to photograph
Garbo. Precious little of his past has
been divulged apart from these bare
facts: born in Bordeaux 58 years ago;
spent childhood in grinding poverty;
after a short time studying law he
became of all things an adver-
tising man, “where I learned to be in-
genious and exact, lessons that took
for me the place of literary studies.”
He was 21 when his first play,
“L’Hermine,” was produced, bringing
him instant recognition.
He classifies his plays as being pieces
noires, pieces roses, or pieces brilliantes
for all of them have the same basic
themes and differ only in their inten-
sity of presentation.. His obsessions are
with bourgeois hypocrisy, what he
sees as society’s galloping decay and
the unbridgeable (and unforgivable)
gulf between the rich and the poor.
Yet, while such a collection of concerns
should have produced a social realist,
Anouilh discusses them from the view-
point of a romantic. His working-class
woes have, paradoxically, given him
something of a conservative’s nostalgia,
and for all their morality his plays are
almost always extravagantly mounted,
heavily mannered fantasies.
Anouilh also detests the languid bore-
dom of the wealthy (you’ll note that
I resisted the temptation to say ennui),
and it is this manifestation of their
decadence that concerns him in
“Thieves’ Carnival,” which is very
much one of his pieces roses.
Boredom is a daring theme for a
writer, as once the idea takes hold
the result can easily be yawns all
round. And, to my taste, the play does
pall early, and cries out for a blast
of prole bitterness to wake it from its
sweet dreaming. Anouilh takes an in-
terminable time to tell us that evil’s
root is bourgeois loot and that youth
equals beauty equals innocence, neither
view being particularly contentious.
Alice O’Donnell did fairly well with
her production, considering the prob-
lems of an amateur cast, a heatwave,
and the mood-shattering din of pass-
ing trams. However, she seemed uncer-
tain as to whether the play should be
high brow or high camp. The actors
who chose the latter course did best,
among them Michael Walker, Brian
Robinson, Audrey Fitch, and Russell
Murphy.


BOOKS
Weighing Morris West
By FRANK ROBERTS
The Tower of Babel. Morris West.
Heinemann. $4.25.
“A SHORT, PUDGY man with apple-
bloom cheeks and twinkling eyes and
a shock of white hair that made him
look more like a retired opera singer
than the head of a Swiss banking
corporation.” One of the slickest, and
worst, of the quick pen sketches Morris
West feels bound to supply with each
new character he introduces in any of
his books, even if, as in this instance,
it is some no-account person making
one appearance only in 339 pages.
Morris West...big themes
Equally novelettish, “Fathalla’s pulse-
beat quickened and a cold sweat broke
out on the palms of his hands”: this
man is an Israeli agent, a ghetto Jew
from Bagdad living under false
identity in Damascus, Syria, and if a
sudden thought of discovery causes this
reaction in him he might better be
described as a bad risk with ever-sweaty
palms.
Such patches of automatic writing,
along with the fitful scattering of cliche
words and phrases (stony-faced, crest-
fallen, contemptuous concentration),
justify the perhaps equally cliched
denigration of Morris West’s books by
many literary people who regard
“popular” and “best-selling” as terms
of instant damnation. I can think of
several popular writers of their times,
writers with gross faults, some of whose
works are now classics because an ele-
ment of greatness in the writer remains
visible among the flaws; and with West
I would suggest that this transfigura-
tion might occur, just possibly, because
of the largeness of the themes he is
willing to tackle.
During the 1960 s West became unique
among the world’s best-selling novelists
by choosing to write the “news-area”
novel. His settings have been Italy (in
the time of a papal election), Vietnam,
and now the Arab States and Israel. It
is a good procedure for the times: no
need to fret over the subject matter of
the next novel, international politics
and the assessable future news-values
will decide that; the costs of travel, mas-
sive research, etc., can be offset against
high taxation assessments; and reader-
interest in a well-chosen news area will
continue long. The demands on such a
novelist are, of course, very great;
enough, it seems, to deter others. It is
necessary for the writer to give his
readers a feeling of actuality, and of
participation with fairly complete
understanding of the landscape, folk-
ways, national customs, and thought.
In “The Tower of Babel” West has
carried out these interpretative chores
impressively. Experts in Arab politics
or Jewish ethos would no doubt be able
to fault parts of the book, but as a
work of fiction, of the “might • be”
rather than the “is so,” it takes in all
the elements which an average reader
in, say, Dubbo, Donnybrook, Duluth,
or Dieppe, now or in the future, might
expect to find in a novel illuminating
that part of the world at this point in
history, while giving him an assimilable
story to follow.
The author has linked men and
women in Israel, Lebanon, Syria, and
Jordan in a web of fiction as tight as
the security nets most of these nations
throw out, both to protect and involve.
The haul is a glittering one of military
men, financiers, politicians, and many
little fish. The intriguing is as sustained
and yet as easy to follow as in a good
detective novel, with the additional
quality of appearing to give a select,
ringside seat to an arena where similar
events are occurring, in elapsed time.
Unlike his quick sketches of people,
West’s rapid-fire descriptions of places,
from sweeps of desert terrain right
down to room furniture, have the
freshness of good personal observation.
Some of the dialogue is as unreal as in a
’thirties movie, and the women are stock
figures hazily presented.
Unlike most recent best-sellers, West
does not make a big thing of sexual en-
counters. He seems to consider it natural
that men and women have passions of
various kinds and indulge them, and to
expect that his readers take this as a
matter of course, too.
A Modern Gogol?
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Master and Margarita. Mikhail
Bulgakov. Collins. $3.85.
AT THE TIME of the terror, as only
the most rabid Stalinist would dispute,
the Devil and his retinue ascended on
Moscow. Mikhail Bulgakov has turned
his visit into a remarkable piece of
social-satire cum modern almost
existential morality which has lost
nothing for having been buried for 30
years. Indeed, only the most farcical
of his grotesqueries can be read today
as fantasy; much of it seems more like
a grim slice of history: heads fall,
people disappear without trace, the
innocent are accused of crimes, the sane
crowd the asylums their only mad-
ness to have told the truth and
writers knowingly risk their lives by
writing “subversive” books like “The
Master and Margarita.”
When the Swiftian allegory is at its
wildest, a black cat swings from the
ceiling with Mausers blazing as it wages
a gun-battle with the police, ill-gotten
Parisian clothes suddenly vanish leav-
ing women naked in the streets, roubles
turn into old paper or into forbidden
foreign currency, men change into pigs
and houses into flames, and the real
Prince of Darkness shows more com-
passion than his human counterpart.
Where the Devil leaves off, man will-
ingly takes over.
This is the overall pervading atmos-
phere of the main level of Bulgakov’s
remarkable novel. The next layer deals
with a contemporary turnabout version
of the Faust legend, with Margarita
instead of Faust (the Master) hiring
herself out to the Devil to enlist his
help; and the third level revolves about
the Master’s great visionary work
his book within a book the “true”
story of Pontius Pilate and the Cruci-
fixion. These themes, the eternal
struggle between good and evil, have,
of course, always obsessed the greatest
thinkers and will no doubt continue
to do so unless we blast ourselves off
the face of the earth, but the author
has tilted them just far enough to-

ward a new light to reveal a fresh
original angle.
Among the more unorthodox twists
are some of Matthew’s Gospel accord-
ing to the Master; Yeshua’s (Jesus’)
last words on the Cross; the two-way
bargaining at the end between Yeshua’s
envoy and Satan to obtain some com-
fortable housing for the Master and
Margarita in some quiet eternity be-
tween heaven and hell; the theologi-
cal discussion on the park bench when
only the Devil in his guise as Woland
is ready to state that a man called
Jesus did live and die on the Cross; the
implication that humans are mostly
evil, anyway, and that Satan’s Mos-
cow appearance merely brings to the
surface what is already there; the con-
tention that cowardice is the biggest
sin and that the truly great enduring
love of a man and a woman, however
illicit in some earthly eyes, is the
supreme virtue.
Out of this confused complex the
author has formed a single, persuasive,
timeless whole, full of subtle little
touches for the initiated, like naming a
trio of characters Berlioz, Rimsky, and
Stravinsky (all composers of “devilish”
music).
Bulgakov’s own life story adds an
ironic postscript: his early death in 1940
went unnoticed in the Russian Press,
although some of his plays, notably
“The Days of the Turbins,” but called
“The White Guard” in a recent BBC-
TV production, had been staged in
Moscow, while others were taken off
in a hurry after official frowns. Last
year this novel, one of a pile of un-
published MSS and still heavily
expurgated the censored parts all
too easily identifiable was printed
for the first time in a Soviet magazine,
which promptly doubled its circulation.
International experts who have read
Bulgakov in the original language claim
him as a latter-day Gogol. For the past
five years, to cap it all, a sort of Devil’s
Advocate (in the form of a Russian
commission) has been investigating his
work. Whether he will be pronounced
immortal literary saint or degenerate
bourgeois sinner is not yet known.
The manipulators
By FRANK KNOPFELMACHER
Student Politics. Edited by Seymour
Martin Lipset. Basic Books Inc. New
York. London. $11.20.
STUDENT POLITICS vary in
intensity and political orientation
throughout the world, but there are
a number of features in common, not
generally known to the non-academic
public. Everywhere there are similar-
ities in style though enormous varia-
tions in political content. Student
activists tend to be radical, idealisic,
possessed by an “ethic of absolute ends”
as against an “ethic of responsibility,”
but there are also among them in-
fluential operators who develop atti-
tudes of hard-boiled cynicism at a sur-
prisingly tender age. Students are
devoted to a large variety of diverse
causes. In Prague in 1939, and again
in 1948, they fought bravely against
totalitarianism. In Berlin and other
cities of the late ’twenties they helped
to impose it. In Djakarta students
existing on a miserable pittance in a
corrupt bogged-down society fight
Communism, while the sons and
daughters of American millionaires
promote a fantastic version of
Maoism at Berkeley, the heartland of
glossy and smooth American capitalism.
Student movements are never really
autonomous despite appearances to
the contrary. They tend to be
“radical” and “irresponsible” appen-
dices of national movements. Behind
the facade of youthful autonomy there
lurks, invariably, a group of middle-
aged operators who hold the strings,
and who are in close communion with
the actual adult “party” (whatever
that “party” may be).
Student movements have always
tended to evoke an impression of
“generational revolt” which is fre-
quently subjectively true —many stud-
ents tend to feel that way—but which
is objectively bogus in that student
movements are pawns in the political
game of different groups of “oldies.”
This is not really contradicted by the
fact that some of the “oldy” manipu-
lators (blissfully rare in Australia but
common in the U.S.A.) bam-
boozle themselves into believing the
endocrinological absurdity that they
have been elevated to the status of
honorary youths.
In undeveloped countries students
sometimes get pretty near to the reins
of social power. In the U.S.A., Eng-
land, and America, student activists
tend to reflect the fantasies, prejudices,
and dogmas of activist sections of
the academic staffs who are, them-
selves, academic “operators” of clubs,
cliques, and parties. Generally speak-
ing, the student activists in Anglo-
Saxon countries are thoroughly unrep-
resentative of the student mass which
shares, on the whole, the beliefs,
prejudices, and interests of the “nor-
mal” mass of the population.
The present volume, like so many
other efforts of the American academic
sausage machine, is uneven in quality,
too long and too expensive for what
it is worth, with lots of padding by
rubbishy “social scientese” (e.g., in an
incredibly boring chapter by one Pro-
fessor Bakke, a mate of Clark Kerr)
but with some good and interesting
stuff in it. The volume covers not
only student politics, but it deals with
the place of universities and their
staffs in the contemporary world. By
far the best chapter is the one by
Joseph Ben David and Randall Col-
lins on academic freedom and student
politics. It describes different sociologi-
cal models of universities and their
vicissitudes when transplanted into the
foreign milieus of undeveloped coun-
tries. The chief merit of this chapter

lies in its realism. It eschews en-
tirely the jargon of academic self-cele-
bration (scholars living for the truth,
etc.) and describes universities as seats
of social power as they exist in the
real world: profane, corruptible,
changeable, and subject to influences
by diverse political interests.
A chapter by Orlando Albornoz on
Latin American universities paints an
alarming picture of student “self-
government” manipulated by Com-
munist and other “revolutionary” par-
ties which has transformed universities
throughout Latin America into in-
doctrination and political recruitment
centres, connived at by frightened and
suborned administrators and professors
who owe their positions not to merit
but to political protection. Lipset and
Altbach’s detailed study of U.S.
students demonstrates a number of
facts on which the general public in
Australia has been almost completely
misled: thus student activism continues
to be restricted to a minute section of
the student population. The “Left-
wing” activists come from wealthy
homes, Right-wing activists from poorer
homes. A crushing majority of the
students accept the values of American
capitalism and over 82 percent sup-
port the Vietnam commitment a
higher percentage than among the
general population, and with a signifi-
cantly higher percentage among them
of outspoken hawks. The chapter also
explodes the generational revolt myth.
While Lipset’s and Altbach’s con-
tribution on the U.S. scene has the ring
of truth I would venture to question
one.of their basic and untested assump-
tions, namely that the Left-wing
student “dissidents” are “rebels” in any
meaningful sense of the word. Both
here and in America student dissidents
are merely vociferous executors of the
fantasies and wishes of influential
and established academics, who know
how to look after their own, job-wise.
From hunger
By CHARLES HIGHAM
The King. Morton Cooper. W. H.
Allen. $3.85.
AT ONE STAGE during Morton
Cooper’s novel “The King,” two of the
characters compile a best-selling novel:
“For five full days and nights, most of
them without sleep, one taking his post
at the typewriter while the other paced
and brewed bad coffee, they composed
as dreadful a short novel as they could
invent in compulsively happy con-
tempt, a novel crammed with over-
heated lesbians and non-stop nympho-
maniacs and grim satyrs . . .” One
could well believe that Mr. Cooper’s
own book had been “written up”
for once that horrible phrase is alto-
gether appropriate to a similar pre-
scription, over powerful brews of instant
coffee and a hot machine.
The story follows with jolting rough-
ness the main outlines of the early part
of Frank Sinatra’s life: the tough, young,
underprivileged kid snatched from the
airless low-grade apartment to success
on radio, the first, mostly bad movies,
the obligatory fistful of broken mar-
riages, the swooning (wasn’t that organ-
ised initially by clever Press agentry?)
of millions in a mass hysteria as con-
tagious as Asian flu. And the character
is reflected here: the dynamic riveting
force of the personality, its tempers and
unpredictable bursts of generosity and
kindness, the sexual magnetism that is
a sine qua non of a popular singer’s
success. An excellent subject for a
sophisticated contemporary novel, but
Mr. Cooper hasn’t trusted it to carry
him forward; he has concocted a mix-
ture composed of elements of “Valley
of the Dolls,” “The Best of Every-
thing,” and “Advise and Consent,” un-
wisely taking his heroic villain into the
world of high-powered American poli-
tics as well as into the upper reaches
of showbusiness.
The book’s style and content are
hilariously predictable; there is even a
scene, at the very start, in which a
woman takes off every stitch of clothing
and looks at herself in a full-length
mirror: an essential in novels of this
kind, where narcissism—like lesbianism
is sure to peep: in before we’ve got
very far.
The fact that the book opens with
Harry Orlando, its central figure, re-
calling his adolescence on the brink
of sexual discovery means that the
prose can get as raunchy as possible
as soon as possible, awakening hot-
pants memories and a swirl of escapist
sexual fantasy in a myriad of tired
businessmen. Even when he’s at the
height of his energy-sapping career,
Orlando’s sexual appetite doesn’t
lessen, and there’s one particularly
brisk session with a paid “large and
luxurious” blonde in front of a tele-
vision show of Harry Orlando planting
a kiss on the cheek of a star, Noreen
Lawrence. Noreen is, in the manner
of a dashed-off charcoal sketch, the
one adequately drawn character in the
book: based very squarely on a well-
known star (the laws of libel prevent
me from saying which), she is a proud,
tough, stubborn lush, reduced finally to
degradation in a scene that Morton
Cooper carries off with all the sear-
ing, stunning power, the raw, earthy,
bleeding realism of a Grace
Metalious. For the rest, the blurb must
have the last word: “drowning his grief
in bottomless booze and faceless
women, reliving his long climb to this
golden nowhere, the hard days as a
skinny teenager, working the two-bit
bands with nothing but a voice and a
hunger . . .” Mr. Cooper has nothing
but a typewriter and hunger for
cash. If he gets yours, don’t say you’ve
not been warned.

MARION RAYMOND'S
COOKBOOK
Is there a
fisherman
in the house?
AS THIS SEEMS to be the time of
year when fishing is pretty popular,
I thought I’d suggest some recipes for
the types of fish usually thought to be
thoroughly uninteresting for the table.
The other day a friend of ours rang
up, after a good day out on a boat,
inquiring whether we would like 18
tailor. Quickly I said, “No!” But then
I remembered both my readers and my
cat, and hastily rang back to say I
had changed my mind. It isn’t every
day you can cook 18 tailor in as many
different ways to discover which tastes
best! My cat, -of course, is not so fussy:
he’ll eat it any way.
Tailor seems to me to be a fish of
no special flavor. But he has nice flesh
and a good color and is certainly
worth spending a little time on when
fresh. (Sometimes seen wearing smoking
jacket on the slab at the delicatessen:
very good smoked, too.)
Recipe 1 (no fancy names here)
and quite the most successful: allow
one tailor, lOin. long approximately,
per person. Do not behead or remove
the tail, but slash him, diagonally, every
2in. all the way up both sides. Into
each gash smear a good dollop of
french mustard (isn’t it good the poor
thing can’t feel it: just imagine
mustard into a gaping hole!). Place
them on foil, heat the griller, sprinkle
liberally with lemon juice, salt, and
freshly ground pepper. When griller
is sizzling, top with a few nobs of
butter and grill until crisp and
bubbling. Then turn them over and
cook likewise on the other side. Simple
enough, but, believe me, positively
delicious.
Recipe 2, which we also thoroughly
enjoyed, and it didn’t take very much
longer to cook only there was more
to wash up at the end of it!
Clean fish, behead, and remove tail,
and dust them lightly in a mixture of
salt and flour. Fry quickly in a mixture
of oil and butter to crisp on both sides,
then turn down heat and cook slowly
until cooked through.
While this is cooking you make a
quick sauce for the finished fish by
melting a good lump of butter in a
frying pan (size of lump will be
governed by number of people to de-
molish tailors). Melt but do not allow
to brown. Add one tablespoon of french
mustard and stir with a wooden spoon
until blended over a medium flame.
When sauce is required, blend in suf-
ficient sour cream to make a smooth
sauce to be poured over fish. We served
only mashed potato with ours and it
was excellent.
Another fish one rarely sees in shops
in Australia is tuna. There’s enough of
it, goodness knows, in tins: swimming
in a bath of brine and used up, one
supposes, in fishcakes and other boring
fare. But the fresh cutlets seen on
most Mediterranean shop slabs seem to
be unheard of. And what an experi-
ence you are missing.
Into the base of your large, thick
saucepan, pour sufficient oil to cover the
base. Then slice sufficient onions to
do likewise. Cook, until transparent,
over medium heat. Add slices of peeled
tomatoes and chopped green capsicums
to the onion and place your tuna cutlets
on top. Sprinkle liberally with lemon
juice and season with salt and freshly
ground pepper. Place the lid on very
firmly and cook ten minutes.
Turn the cutlets over (stir the veget-
ables below) and add a quarter bottle
of white wine. Season once more, re-
place the lid, and cook for another
ten minutes. Remove fish and place on
serving dish. Turn heat up briefly to \
allow liquid to reduce before pouring
vegetable mixture over tuna to serve.
Bonito, seen more often in the shops,
is really just a domestic-sized tuna; in
any case, it is also a very delicious fish.
These we bake in the oven.
Like the first tailor I suggested, the
fish is cleaned, head and tail left in-
tact, and deeply gashed at intervals
on both sides. Into each gash place
a slice of lemon, a sprig of parsley,
and a tiny piece of fresh dill. Put the
whole fish on sufficient foil to wrap
him up comfortably. Dust liberally
with salt and pepper and flecks of
butter. Close the foil and bake until
nearly cooked. The time will depend
on the size of your catch. About 30
minutes for a four-pounder. Remove
from the oven, open the foil, and add a
good glass of dry white wine. Close the
foil, replace in oven, and cook for an-
other ten minutes or so.
Serve on a platter garnished with
fresh lemon slices and parsley. (Remove
the cooked decorations, because after
that length of time in the oven they
begin to look rather tired and washed-
out.) There are lots of other fish in
the sea, and many interesting ways of
cooking them, which we’ll get around
to on another day.
But there is just one little plea I
would like to make. Sport is sport, I
know. But do try and concentrate on
catching only fish which can be eaten
• and throw the others back. People
who go round catching marlin should,
in my opinion, be treated in similar
fashion. Marlin is not an eating fish.
Like the dolphin, he is a king among
fish, doing no harm to anyone. And
people who catch him are, in my
opinion, no better than murderers.


LETTERS
Underground films
If the Australian film critic rose in
his wrath to every error in the work
of his fellows, little time would remain
for other activities. I break, however,
a life-long rule to comment on Phillip
' Adams’ “Avant Guardsvan” piece (8.,
March 2).
Joseph Losey’s son is Gaverik, not
Gavin, Don Levy spells his name with-
out an “a”, and Michel, not Michael,
Pearce made “Sunday in Sydney,” but
I am more concerned that Mr. Adams
wrote his review apparently unaware
that “Point of Noon” is just an extract
from Don Levy’s earlier sponsored
documentary “Time Is,” with the addi-
tion of a new 7 soundtrack. “Dream
A. 40” may be “pedestrian” though
I don’t think so but at least it’s
original material.
Somebody might also mention to
Beverley Tivey that “Winter Light” is
the second, not third, of Bergman’s
trilogy on the modern spiritual agony,
the film's lack of box-office potential
having kept it locked in a local dis-
tributor’s vault for two years without
a Sydney or Melbourne release, while
the sexier “The Silence” was raced
into a theatre immediately after pur-
chase.

Dr. Forbes' dilemma
The final paragraph of an anonymous
comment on Dr. Forbes’ performance
as a Minister (8., Feb. 24) included
tw'o statements which are untrue. The
paragraph accused the drug companies
of promoting campaigns against Dr.
Forbes for (1) his efforts to reduce
prices of drugs listed as Pharmaceutical
Benefits and (2) for his “Bill" to
streamline drug control. Item (2) is
not only false but sadly out of date.
The “Bill” to control “Therapeutic
Goods” became an Act of Parliament
in May, 1966.
Before introducing this Bill, which
gave him unusual power to determine
standards and gazette them without
reference to Parliament, Dr. Forbes
invited representatives of the pharma-
ceutical industry to discuss its pro-
visions and offered them representa-
tion on a main advisory committee to
be set up under the Act. Amendments
(up or down) of prices of medicines
for the National Health Scheme are
agreed with the Department of Health
by individual suppliers, not by this
Association. So the facts best refute
your false accusation.
It is unlikely that any manufac-
turer of any product is overjoyed to
see profit margins reduced; but sup-
pliers of Pharmaceutical Benefits have
made price cuts progressively, for 17
years, without any evidence of a cam-
paign against any of the five or more
Ministers concerned.

The Catholic Bishops
I wish to comment on only one part of
Mr. Brian Buckley’s article on “The
Catholic Bishops” (8., Feb. 24). Twice
he quotes unnamed Jesuit priests.
Whether Jesuit priests in Australia
made these statements I do not know.
I do not accept the allegation that they
did. No reference is given and the
assertion is unverifiable. Made* or not,
these anonymous quotations give the
false implication that these men are
speaking as Jesuits, and somehow
speaking in the name of the Jesuit
order. In the name of the Jesuit order
I reject and disown these remarks.

I submit that the conservatism of
Rome’s Propaganda College has been
exaggerated by some of Brian Buckley’s
interviewees. Any of the post-war gen-
eration of Propaganda men could have
provided your writer with first-hand
information about the liberalism of the
College’s rule since the present rector.
Monsignor Felice Ccnci. began his long
term of office in 1947.
The open and free spirit of "Prop"
under Cenci was worrying the old guard
in Rome well before Vatican ll’s
breezes started to blow. And when the
Council began, voting Propaganda
bishops and theologians, principally
from the new African and Asian
nations, were well to the fore in the
progressive camp.
During my own years at "Prop” (the
'fifties) the College's reputation in
Rome was exactly contrary to that des-
cribed by one of Mr. Buckley’s Jesuit
friends: instead of being regarded as
the city's most conservative seminary,
it was deemed the most radical.
Monsignor Cenci has always placed
a lot of trust (his critics held that it
was far too much) in self-discipline
and formation. Under him, we trainee-
priests had the kind of freedom of
movement and scope for contact with
the "outside world” which most other
seminaries in the Church are only now
beginning to admit.
It is true that the seminary days of
most of Australia's Propaganda-trained
bishops belong to the more rigid (but
not completely oppressive) pre-Cenci
era. But must we accept a deterministic
view of their College’s influence on
them? My own impression is that they
represent a surprising variety of both
outlook and temperament.
After all, if heavily regimented and
obscurantist seminaries necessarily pro-
duce narrow-minded clerics, Pope John,
an alumnus of the Roman Seminary
and a survivor of the anti-Modernist
hysteria of the first decade of our cen-
tury, ought not to have been the man
that he was.
It would be interesting if Mr. Buck-
ley took a longer and wider look at
the influence of Propaganda College
on the Australian Church. I think he
would discover that in many dioceses
healthy progressivism and, in some
areas, even some daringly radical move-
ments are being assisted if not spear-
headed by “Propagandists” and not
always the juniors.
Michael E. Costigan

The article of Brian Buckley makes
sad reading. It needs no great scholar-
ship to know that some bishops fall
short of their office: Judas is suffi-
cient evidence of this; equally telling
is the fearful cowardice of Peter, never-
•aheless outshone in his later and per-
severing generosity culminating in
martyrdom. Monica Baldwin has come
to realise that the will to pray is the
most radical quality in a Christian.
Did Father Davis realise this? His
own apologia suggests that he did not.
The practice of regular prayer, whether
it be in bishop or layman, does more
to solve tensions than any other means:
naturally other means are not excluded,
but rather are they enjoyed—enjoined
in a spirit of prayer, which begets
humor, a quality in which our con-
temporary self-styled liberals are as
barren as if they were Cromwellians.
Recently a Spanish friend who is
truly a liberal spoke critically of
General Franco. In the course of dis-
cussion I suggested to him that Alfonso
xrn was a great man, because, although
he had the military support and suffi-
cient popular support to retain the
throne, he preferred to abdicate rather
than spill blood. My friend replied
that Alfonso ought not to have
abdicated, and by doing so he showed
he was a weak man: he could have
saved the Spaniards untold horrors . . .
one was constrained to ask whether
Franco ought not to avoid the bad
example of Alfonso and follow my
friend's notion of what Alfonso ought
to have done, that is, stand “four
square" to preserve community values
as against a tattered individualism. My
friend had sufficient humor to say that
were I to be in Spain and express such
views Franco would make me his Prime
Minister. What a hard time we poor
liberals have, except when sustained by
hindsight.

you enjoy in Johnnie Walker
