The Red Page
Lawson
Henry Lawson is the first Australian
writer of verse to have complete justice done
to his work by the publication of a selected
volume in which publisher, artist and printer
have combined to get the best possible
results. When Lawson went to the “dry”
irrigation region of Yanko it was mentioned
that he would spend his retreat in a revision
of some of his best work as well as in the
production of new. It is this revision, con-
densation and general overhaul of much well-
known verse that gives the new volume its
peculiar distinction. Most of the old favor-
ites are there with all that was true and
ringing and strong in them, but with a
faulty line here and there picked up, a firmer
phrase substituted for a weak one, and a
good many stanzas which were not quite
worthy to stand beside the others removed
altogether. A comparison of some of the
poems as here printed with the version
given in the earlier volumes will show the
improvement; for there is improvement with-
out any loss of the genuine Lawson touch
which gives life to the whole. Some verses
not included in any of the published volumes
have been chosen from Henry’s recent con-
tributions to this paper—notably “Scots of
the Riverina” and “England Yet” —and these
show well beside the older work to prove to
all that the poet still has great songs to
sing. Judged by the selected edition, he
should take his place more definitely than
ever as the first and truest interpreter of
Australia; and for those beyond seas to
whom he is yet unknown the book will open
up a new realm in literature unlike any
other. He is Lawson yet, without rivals and
with an ever-increasing grip on the souls of
men.
The new volume is finely illustrated. A
reproduction in color of the portrait by Long-
staff’ in the National Gallery, Sydney, faces
the title page; and the book Contains a large
number of drawings by Percy Leason, who
has caught the spirit of the bush and of the
verses better than any who previously tried.
There is a preface by David McKee Wright,
in which the author’s life and growth are
carefully and briefly traced; and the dates
of original publication attached to the'vari-
ous poems have a special value for the
student. The publishers deserve to be con-
gratulated on the publication. (Selected
Poems of Henry Lawson. Angus and
Robertson, Sydney.)
Cone West Another Singing
Soldier
Australia loses a verse-maker of promise
in the lovable Tasmanian, A. R. Blaekmore,
news of whose death from tuberculosis, fol-
lowing two sets of wounds and a gassing,
was received by his young widow from a
London hospital on Armistice Day. Most
of Blackmore’s verse appeared in W. A.
Woods’s Hobart Clipper a decade ago ; his
more youthful attempts were printed in the
Tas. Mail, and one or two pieces of his
more recent work were in the Lone Hand,
A small volume of collected verse was pub-
lished in Hobart in 190!), while the young
author was school-teaching for a bripf
season in N. S. Wales. It was dedicated to
liis sister, S. J. Blaekmore, now the wife of
Tas. Senator Earle.
He was born on his father’s dairy-farm at
Nugent. S. Tasmania, in 1884, an only son.
The shy, studious lad early began to write
verses in between times when he was
qualifying for school-teaching. Three or
four years ago he married a clever
Tasmanian girl, and settled down as
the village schoolmaster at Alonnah, Bruni
Island, the sawmill townlet on the shores of
Adventure Bay (where Captain Cook once
looked in). Here, in 1915, Blaekmore heard
the call to arms, and though the bare
thought of killing any fellow-creature had
always filled the soul of the gentle idealist
with horror, his capacity for sacrifice of self
converted him into an efficient soldier and
carried him across the seas to earn a sol-
dier’s grave.
Of the verses included in the 1909 booklet,
“Shade and Echo,” it may be said that
hardly any are remembersome, though some
are distinctly promising, in spots; others
are “echoey” of Tennyson and Wordsworth :
but all are earnest and many of them tinged
with a not unattractive melancholy scliolar-
liness. He sang mostly of regrets and
generally ended with a note of honelessness.
Thus: —
Farewell, O days! that bore so fair a sheen —
Too soon! too late! ye sped your vocal flight:
And fare ye well, ye visions! that did screen
With rainbow wings the fell, encroaching night!
I thought to sing, when youth within the heart
It.s shining court of dreams elusive held —
But youth and dreams are shadows that depart,
And aching time has sweet illusion quell’d. _
In his strongest verses he voiced a Democ-
racy vibrant with the sure touch of pro-
phecy and aglow with unquenchable faith.
He was one of the most passionately patri-
otic Australians this writer ever met.
Though steeped to the roots of his hair in
the poetry of all the British masters, and
not lacking a first-hand knowledge of the
best French and American work, he had an
abiding faith in and admiration for the
makers of Australian songs. He held the
opinion, and gently but persistently backed
his opinion by a wealth of analytical argu-
ment and ready quotation, that Australia’s
best was as good as anything in the lan-
guage, and that Australia’s f.a.q. verse and
prose was better value for the consumers’
money than anything on earth.
• • —■ —
Northcliffe’s last fly before Fritz caved
in was The Courier of the Air. which
British airmen dropped in thousands from
the clouds on enemy soil. The Huns were very
wild when the truth about the war fluttered
from Heaven and filed itself on the helmet-
spikes. Proclamations and threats of severe
penalties were fulminated against everybody
caught with a copy of The Courier, and all
copies found had to be handed over imme-
diately. But even that didn’t save the war
for them.

No other roofing can better withstand the furies of the
elements —of wind, rain, heat, cold than Adamax.
No other roofing is so well able to resist the ravages of

“Adamax.” For “Adamax” Roofing has behind it a
finishing process that makes it practically timeproof —the

Deep in their folds to the innermost depths

And the echoes leap, and up from the dark-

Is breathed again a murmurous sigh pro-

In sympathy.

rolling lands!
Here the tempests pass,
Scattering flashing rain from their open
hands,
Hunting in shouting bands
The shadows whirled on the race of the rip-
pling grass,
And joy flies light on the wing as a circling
swallow
O’er the gusts of song and the quivering
fugues that follow,
And dancing spin in the clefts of each ring-
ing hollow
The drifted sands.
Breath in the nostrils of life, a stir in the
heart
And a cry on the lips;
Rapture that soars and sings like a bird
apart.
Till the wild tears start,
And the mounting soul the surge of the gale
outstrips;
Freedom exultant whose passionate pueau
flies,
Thronging the crystalline heights of the
echoing skies
With magical music then wanes.. . .and
the glory dies,
And the gods depart.

The Gardener.
You found a thirsty, barren plain.
And tenderly, with loving care
That recked not of the toil or pain.
You made a garden blossom there.
First heartsease raised a smiling row
Of fairy faces to the sun.
Then all the happy flowers that grow
Came stealing forth shy, one by one.
The red rose and the white you set
On lacy trellis arched with skill,
By fragrant beds of mignonette
You flung the gold of daffodil.
Among the flowers, like drowsy bees.
My happy thoughts went murmuring,
And sometimes in the scented trees
A bird flashed up on jewelled wing.
And in that place of still delight
A sudden shower of golden notes
Would fall like fluttering petals bright.
Or drift —a fleet of fairy boats.
And then you went —the roses died
Upon the bush—for loneliness.
My winter seared the lilies’ pride
That drooped for lack of your caress.
Ah, heedless earth, too warm and kind !
All, skies with merry gold to fling!
The tears that made the winter blind
Were blossom-laughter in the Spring.
Once more my garden blooms for me,
The rose can reign in royal state;
And fragrant-white in rosemary
Remembrance breathes beside the gate.

De Profundis.
In at my window there blew a song
From a red rose breathing the rain-washed
air,
And its notes were silver and clear and long,
But the theme as shy as a hunted hare.
Courage and laughter in it were wed —
Never a tear of the night before,
Never a stain of the blood hot red
That dripped from the wound in my
heart's deep core.
Oh, rosebush stark in the Autumn night,
That once was heavy with bloom for me,
Though tears rained thick from my blinded
sight,
lou stirred not through my Gethsemane.
Never a sign of life you gave,
Nor a bud put forth from your pulseless
Womb,
For the soul of each must each one save,
T\ ithout sign from the living or sign from
the tomb.
Upright I stood where I had lain
upon the pulseless sod.
‘My soul is freed though my heart is slain.
I ut forth, O Heaven, the flowering rod.”
And the tree whose blooming I dreamed was
o’er,
lhis Dawn has put forth a rose deep red,
And swift there stirs in my heart's warm
core. ... ...
A song where laughter and joy are wed.

THE NEXT GREAT WAR.
It is the fashion to heave a sigh of relief
and say that the world has seen its last
great war. The same thing has been said
at intervals ever since the human race began
to keep a record of wars. Norman Angell
wrote a book proving the great war to be
impossible just before it happened, and
thereby acquired much money which oll gkt
to be returned. The world, he demonstrated
couldn’t fight because if it did so it would
be ruined. Then the great aggressor pro-
ceeded to fight because he was being ruined
by the cost of preparation for conquest,
and had to square his accounts by collecting
an indemnity from his neighbors; and the
defenders fought because it was better to be
ruined and free than ruined and enslaved.
The next struggle will start in due time
under a new generation, just as_ the new
game rooster fights regardless of the dread-
ful mortality of the old rooster, who lost
100 per cent, of his forces, also his fowl-run
and all his harem in battle. The nations
won’t necessarily wait even to clear up tne
debris before they begin again. When
Britain, the best financed of the European
Powers, went into the late lamented scrap
it had barely finished paying the bill for the
campaign which ended at W aterloo,
years ago. The other States, large and
small, were in much the same condition.
The next war, if it comes soon, may be run
on cheaper lines as a matter of necessity,
but that is a mere detail. Cheap wars often
cause more bloodshed than^ expensive^ones.
The fighting capacity of the world isn’t
exhausted, or anything like exhausted, and
it is onlv the fighting capacity that counts.
The bill can always be repudiated, it may
ruin the people who lose their money, but
that won’t matter to them after they are
dead, and they will all be dead soon, lhe
present situation is that four of the Gi-eat
Powers may be relatively weaker than they
were. Russia, Germany and Austria are
not so formidable, even to their exhausted
neighbors, as they used to be. France is
probably weaker; it will recover the lost
populations of Alsace-Lorraine, but it is
questionable if they will make up imme-
diately for the man and woman power that
has been sacrificed. Italy, Japan and the
United States will probably be stronger.
The United States reckons it lias gained, by
its strenuous ship-building policy, the com-
mercial supremacy of the sea, which is _ no
small asset. Japan has lost a mere handlul
of men, and has got a lien on a vast amount
of territory as well as securing a powerful
commercial position in the Pacific the one
which Australia should have had, but by its
miserable failure to build ships it lost the
opportunity. And there are other States
which have risen in the world, bpain, Uhui,
Argentina, Brazil (which was only a nomi-
nal combatant) and China are in a better
position to disturb the world’s peace than
they were before if the craze of disturbance
should come on them. Fourth-rate Powers
have become third-rate, and third-rate
Powers have become second-rate because
some first-rate Powers have slid down a
step. ,
Theoretically there is to be a general dis-
arming, and barring the fact that the United
States has announced a record programme of
warship-building, and that none of the other
Allies have said anything definite about
their own intentions, everything points that
way. Of course, the disarming can only be
a comparative affair. Scientifically. trained
armies must be preserved for police pur-
poses. They must be preserved else every
man with a club or a bit of iron will be the
equal of every man of the same size simi-
larly armed, and if the most numerous man
with the most inspired leader happened to
be a nigger of some sort, then civilisation
might end before it quite knew that the
scrap had begun. The one reason why
Giiengiu Khan doesn’t come to Europe
again with his spearmen and his sundries, or
why the Maiidi didn’t come at all, is that
the European soldier is the better equipped
and better trained. Should he abandon his
advantages because they have made a great
part of Europe a desolation, then Europe
may got an African or an Arab or a Tartar
desolation instead. If all the world were
to disarm and inaugurate the reign of peace,
then every man would be a soldier and
always on a war-footing, with the kitchen
poker or the back-yard axe or the pike,
made by the village blacksmith at a mo-
ment’s notice, for his weapon. He ‘would
be quite as good as the present-day trained
soldier, for his opponent would be no better.
And his military organisation would be un-
paralleled, for there would be no other sort.
At the best, then, there will be an all-
round reduction of armies and possibly of
navies, and the saving of expense will be a
stupendous blessing. The trained forces
must be large enough to keep internal order
and to stave off attacks from semi-civilised
races —Kaffirs, Tartars and the like —who
might otherwise be seized with a mistaken
idea that it is their turn to own the earth.
The armies may have to be larger than
might be expected, for they won’t keep up
the same standard of efficiency. When the
fear of the Napoleonic empire died out
military affairs became amazingly slipshod.
The Crimea campaign was a comic-opera
affair, in which the third-rate army beat the
fifth-rate one after both had made every pos-
sible mistake. A second-rate army which
made one mistake less than the possible
might have chased them both off the earth.
With the vanishment of the Hun menace —
if it has really vanished —the dreadful and
ruinous efficiency which it forced on other
nations is expected to partly vanish also. It
is hoped that it will do so ; consequently it
is hoped that, a certain number of years’
hence, the casual colored man of the desert
and the jungle may be much nearer a match
for the white soldier than he is now. The
white races have to keep this aspect of the
case in view.
The ambitious and ferocious military
genius with 200,000 moderate soldiers, the
numbers being limited all round by a League
of Nations, would be quite as dangerous as
the one with 4,000,000 good soldiers, the
numbers not being limited by anybody. That
is assuming that there was a general reduc-
tion of, say, 90 or 95 per cent. In fact, he
would be better off. The Kaiser who wants
to increase his army surreptitiously by 50
per cent, would find it hard to make
2,000,000 efficient new troops without at-
tracting attention, but 100,000 might be
raised to efficiency—the lowered standard of
efficiency—in a corner of a big country
under pretence of being a Young Huns’
Athletic Association or even a Convalescent
Home. And the small Hun army, assum-
ing that forces were reduced all round on
the same scale, could do every whit as much
desolation and torture and rape in Serbia,
France and Belgium as the big one. The
fighting would be done by the small trained
force in front, and the horrors by the levy
en masse of the people with pickaxes and
gelignite (supposed to be made. exclusively
for mining operations) following behind.
Great forces are really superfluous. Some
of the Asiatic armies which reduced a large
part of Europe to a cinder in the days "when
the European hadn’t got into the disastrous
habit of bloated armaments and superior
military efficiency would have been called
mere divisions to-day. Yet they did their
work so wonderfully and so horribly that
part of Eastern Europe hasn’t recovered
yet, and never will. For the hordes left
behind them a strain of Mongol blood which
will onlv be eradicated when the Ethiopian
becomes" white and the leopard erases his
spots. Even the Great Army of Napoleon at
its best never mustered in one place more
than 600.000 men, collected from eight or
nine nations. # #
A favorite precaution agaipst future war
is a League of Nations composed of those
peoples who feel friendly to-day but some of
whom may be vety hostile to-morrow. Un-
fortunately, a league to be of any value must
be more than a temporary alliance of gov-
ernments and armies, like the Balkan com-
bine of Montenegro. Greece, Serbia and
Bulgaria which was, and then was not, and
wished it had never been. It implies a cen-
tral Government and Parliament controlling
the joint military and naval resources of its
members, also their tariffs and foieign
policy. In such an arrangement the small
members usually demand equal representa-
tion in one House with the large ones, to
prevent them being totally ignored and
obliterated. Wherefore Tasmania has as
many Senators as N.S.W. and Nevada as
many as New York State. It is the only
possible way in theory, but in practice
France objects to Greece having equal con-
trol of its army, and Britain dislikes Swit-
zerland having the same voice as itself about
its navy, and the scheme falls through.
Great Federations like the United States,
Brazil and Australia, where the people are
practically of one race and language, are
possible. * European Federations seem im-
possible. The chances are that when the
dust and the smoke and the ddbris are
cleared away the world will go on much in
the old way, though with vastly smaller and
more economical armaments, and that war
will be marked down to bargain-sale figures,
so that it may happen any time.
THE RUINOUS LUXURY OF AGRI-
CULTURE AND OTHER THINGS.
The Amalgamated Society of Engineers has
tabled a demand for a 20 per cent, increase
of wages, recent increases granted by the
Court being unsatisfactory. The signs are
that it will get what it asks for. There is
no reason why the Amalgamated men
shouldn’t have a 20 per cent, rise or any
other rise, provided it doesn’t so increase
the cost of production that the badly-pro-
tected industry will be restricted to the
patching and repairing work which can t be
imported. Apparently the engineers have
few delusions on this subject, for .they say
that, as the returned soldiers of their craft
drift back, it will be necessary to reduce
working hours. This is to be done to make
the scrap of work spread round and cover
the multitude, for a community of helpless
shiftless borrowers and importers and low-
tariffists doesn’t expect much new work to
develop, though there is a whole empty con-
tinent for it to develop in. The engineers
are not exceptional in this matter. In
many lines there is anxiety about how the
fragment of skilled employment can be
made to go round, after room is allowed for
the imported goods which are pouring in
just now at a rate approaching £100,000,000
a year, and which, according to the import-
ing-curse theory, have first claim on the
market. And in case the engineering in-
dustry should develop beyond the patch and
repair business which, unfortunately for the
low-tariff gospel, can’t be imported, the
War Profits Tax is being tightened up and
improved and extended. There being no
active war now of the kind that seriously
interferes with commerce, but merely some
disorganised internal scuffles, the impost is,
of course, now a Peace Profits Tax.
The excuse, or species of excuse, that
once existed for the tax was that the
enormous war freights were in themselves
an incidental Protection; that the with-
drawal of millions of men from industry for
military service reduced competing foreign
supplies; and that the diversion to munition
jobs of the workers who hadn’t gone to the
war brought competing foreign supplies
down to vanishing point. Therefore it was
alleged that local manufacturers would
make new and incredible profits, and that it
was only fair to confiscate three-quarters of
them to the State. Freights are rapidly
falling now; the closed water-ways are re-
opened ; the submarine menace is dead; the
soldier-workers will shortly begin to resume
work, and the annual contingent that comes
of working age is already going into the
workshops instead of into the army. Also
the munition-works are slowing down and
releasing many hands. But the Freetrade
hunger to destroy local manufactures keeps
the War Profits (or Peace Profits; Tax
going. Incidentally the tax had very little
excuse even while real war existed. In
certain countries it was found necessary to
put unprecedented restrictions on the rush
of money into local industries for various
reasons. It was wanted for soldiers’ pay,
for the equipment of gigantic munition-fac-
tories, for building ships on a heroic scale,
and for loans to impecunious Allies. Men
also had to be economised for munition and
ship making. In Britain there was also
need to finance and man a wonderful
scheme of compulsory wheat-growing. Aus-
tralia didn’t pay its soldiers save with bor-
rowed coin abroad and paper money at
home. It didn't equip munition-factories
worth a cent. It didn’t build ships. It
didn’t lend a copper to impecunious Allies;
rather it tried to borrow from them. It
didn’t resurrect agriculture or anything
else. Its capital hadn’t been rushing into
local industry in any case. Its War Profits
scheme was a piece of childish or monkeyish
imitation, like the nigger peerage of Haiti
or Mark Twain’s Great Revolution of
Pitcairn.
* * * *
A recent development, or the recent revival
of a chronic development, is the fairly
general expression of confidence among
State Premiers, who say that now that the
war is over more loan money will be avail-
able with which to pay liberal wages on
public works of a semi-pauper or semi-relief
character. That is to say, they are largely
works which are not expected to yield
enough to pay interest and maintenance and
working expenses, but will have to be sub-
sidised out of taxes like the Old Age Pen-
sions Fund or the Baby Bonus. (The war,
curiously enough, seems to be _ finished for
purposes of borrowing, and it is coming to
an end automatically for purposes of im-
porting, but for the purpose of special taxa-
tion on new local manufactures it is still in
full blast, and may rage indefinitely.) New
State loan works, of course, aren’t required
to pay any share of their profits under the
Federal War Tax. Another development is
the very promising effort of the Labor party
to capture Sydney Municipal Council, which
holds out some promise of capturing control
of Greater Sydney later on. and Greater
Sydney means about half N. S. 'VS ales’ popu-
lation. Its programme includes municipal
insurance, municipal superannuation fund,
and a vast policy (loan policy, of course)
of municipal houses, shops, trading of an
sorts, coal-mines, bands, orchestras and sun-
dries. It is creditable, but in view of ttie
party’s habits it looks fairly expensive. 1 hese
devices will also pay no War Trouts, c' en
though the war. for taxation purposes,
should last into next century. That doesn t
matter much. What does matter is that,
like the proposed rush of public works and
the proposed spreading out over a larger and
better-paid human surface of the available
scrap of engineering toil, the new devices
don’t even hint at the creation of any new
self-supporting industries.
* * *
In fact, the ruinous luxury of agriculture
embodies the only big extension of produc-
tive (dubiously productive) industry that is
heard of just now, ship-building having
apparently died a natural death. lake
municipal and State loan enterprises, agri-
culture has always been exempt from the
operation of the War Profits law. It maj
bo in theory the backbone of the country,
but everybody tacitly recognises that the
backbone is a tender plant and can t stand
rough usage. So far as N. S. Wales is
concerned its principal products, grain and
flour, were carried by rail last year at. an
average rate of 3s. 4d. per ton per 100 miles,
and hay, straw and chaff at 3s. Bd. Goal,
coke and shale paid ss. Id.; firewood, 9s. Id.;
live stock, 10s. Bd.; wool, 18s. Id.; and
miscellaneous goods, 12s. Id. The rates are
exceedingly moderate on the average, but
those for wheat, hay, straw and chaff are
absurdly low by comparison, and apparently
it isn’t reckoned that they can be raised
without disaster. In 1891, when the wheat
area of the Ma State was small and com-
paratively close to the one big market and
seaport, wheat sent by rail had to pay on
an average for 1114 miles of haulage, and
the industry was alive. In 1916 the wheat
area of the State had increased twelve-fold,
and the industry had spread so far out that
every ton which travelled by rail had to
cover on an average 2464 miles. And
because many of the inland towns had
shrunk, a larger proportion of the crop had
to pay for railway haulage in 1917 than in
1891. Also a large proportion of the later
crop had to pay for 12,000 miles or so of
sea carriage in addition to the long railway
haul, while none of the early crop carried
that stupendous burden. The State wasn’t
an exporter then. So the outlying farmer,
killed off by great distances and other
things, threw up the sponge so emphatically
that in 1918 the average railway haul of
wheat was only 1884 miles instead of 2464-
The cattle and sheep men, though their pro-
duct pays enormous (and increasing) rail-
wav charges by comparison, kept creeping
further out, and their products were carried
longer and longer distances: but the wheat
man crept closer in. Thanks to the lack of
a big manufacturing population and the
congestion of what there is into one city in
each State, after the manner of Adelaide,
Melbourne and Sydney, the Australian
wheat-grower is often further even from
the local market of his own State than the
European one who sells to a foreigner two
or three kingdoms away. And in a hand of
comparatively high wages and decidedly
poor crops the industry can’t stand it.^
How much more of the ruinous luxury of
agriculture as practised under present con-
ditions the country can stand is a mystery.
There is a bankruptcy point somewhere. If
there were three times as much produce to
be carried by rail at a loss —a bigger loss
per ton on account of increased distances —
it would be serious. The revenue sacrificed
in N. S. Wales by carrying farm produce
below the average rate was, last year, about
£700,000, and the previous year, when there
was more produce, it was nearly £1,000,000.
This is a considerable subsidy, and can’t bear
being multiplied by three. Then, if there was
three times as large a section of the popula-
tion engaged in an industry which has to be
exempted from heavy taxes because it can’t
stand, then it would be very serious. The
non-exempt people would have to pay up
lavishly. And the amount of money which
is required to put each new settler on 300
or 400 acres of loss is exceedingly serious.
Yet the ruinous luxury of agriculture seems
to be the only thing in which our rulers
take an interest.
SPANKING THE DOMESTIC FELINE.
Melbourne Age stands head and shoulders
above the other “great dailies” of the period
for its consistent denunciation of the waste
of loan money. In that respect it resembles
Saul, the son of Kish, who was also a lofty
publication in his time. And. like Saul,
the Age has an unsatisfactory streak about
it. Most consistently, like the crying owl
or Solomon Eagle or Jeremiah, it points
to the borrowings that have gone for non-
paying or insufficiently-paying purposes and
for unnecessary purposes and purposes that
were necessary but not remunerative. And
it points to the eternal dead-weight of the
interest bill and moans like a soul in tor-
ment. It assumes that the interest bill must
be eternal, we being a chosen people—
chosen for special incapacity—-who can
never pay up for the old blunders or old
experiments, and wipe the slate clean, and
cheerfully start afresh. Rather it holds
that, with the lesson of the past in view.
Australia should spend the rest of its days
or the rest of its millions of years in chronic
repentance, taking few risks, avoiding big
enterprises, and walking on flat, noiseless
slippers along narrow ways of common-
place. Almost daily it publishes something
like this in big fat letters spread across two
columns on the leader page:—
AUSTRALIA’S WHITE ELEPHANTS.

£20,664,787


It is a weary and profitless policy of
nine the cat. The items are, of course, all
works which don’t pay at present, and two
of which—the Canberra capital and Aus-
tralia House—may never pay at all. ihat
is bad. They are all Federal works, which
is worse. Also they are all E ederal woi ks
outside Victoria, which is simply damnable.
And if all the non-paying public enterprises
of Australia, State and Federal, were
listed the category would be very much
worse. The whole Western section of Vic-
toria is run at a loss. Most of the Victorian
railways are a loss —in fact, some of them
are closed and some have been torn up. And
the great Parliament House at Melbourne
is an appalling elephant. #
But the spirit of the affair is of more
importance than the details. Every country
makes hideous mistakes in its works and
lands policy, and incurs bad investments. of
many sorts —blunders compared to which
Canberra and Australia House are only like
the assistant deputy parasite that lives on
the parasitic flea. But until the accursed
loan policy was invented these affairs were
paid for in one way or another, and wiped
off. No one had invented, till recently,
the process of carrying them on from genera-
tion to generation at 5 per cent, compound
interest —that process by which £1,000,000
spent on Australia House, London, to-day
may become a loss of £17,000,000,000 in two
centuries time. So the losses had to be wiped
off in some way—and then the nation went
forth like a giant refreshed to make new
blunders and also at times to make big suc-
cesses. If the loan policy had been devised
earlier and England had been run as Aus-
tralia is to-day, this is the sort of thing
that would be appearing in the London
papers. (Wars are, of course, omitted from
the list) :

These are only a few out of the multitude of un-
■sucessful public enterprises which have burdened the
taxpayer with a hopeless debt. The execution of
Charles I. was conducted on such a lavish scale that
it added £67,000 to the national liabilities, and the
deficits caused by the Black Death and subsequent
plagues have not yet been fully ascertained. In view
of these circumstances the proposal to establish an
air service should be strongly opposed. The country
is too heavily taxed on account of the cost of the
introduction of Christianity—an experiment which
never paid interest on the cost, but rather proved a
ruinous charge on the Treasury—to adopt any for-
ward policy at present.

That presents a picture of England as it
would be if the Australian policy of charging
every sort of work to loans and never paying
the loans had been adopted there in olden
times and had prevailed ever since. And it
presents a picture of Australia as it is —or
at least as it very soon will be if the present
system endures. Wireless will make the old
telegraphs as obsolete as the Roman walls,
and air navigation is liable to put the rail-
ways into the same category for uselessness
as the Tower of London. (Air navigation of
a sort dates back as far as 1783, and if the
invention of the railway hadn’t diverted
attention from it and interrupted its pro-
gress it might be the regular means of loco-
motion to-day. In fact, if the puffy box of
tricks, which is chained to one road and
that a road costing thousands of pounds per
mile, had postponed its coming for 50 years
it might never have come at all.) At pre-
sent there are three schools of financial
thought in Australia. One is represented by
the Holman type, which holds there is no
drunken past to repent of; that the past
wasn’t so drunk as it should have been;
and that the future ought to be drunker.
Another is represented by the Age, which
reckons w T e should weep bitterly and miser-
ably over the past and regard it as irrepar-
able, and spank the domestic feline. The
Bulletin runs the third school practically
on its own, with the theory that we should
pay off the mistakes of the past and proceed
to have a future.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Gas, Scavenging and Funerals.
It was rather a shock to many people when
they learned that the Amalgamated Engi-
neers of Australia had put in a demand for
20 per cent, increase of wages. Twenty per
cent, seemed large and sudden for a body of
men who were supposed to be already well
paid. There was a great diminution of the
shock when it was discovered that the best
and most highly-paid of the men concerned —
the ones in whose case the artisan most
nearly approaches the artist —were only
asking about £5 a week in the two most
populous States. It doesn’t seem much in
the circumstances —yet in those branches, of
the industry that are exposed to foreign
competition it may easily prove too .much,
in which case some Amalgamated Engineers,
instead of getting £5 a week, may get
nothing at all. Scavengers in some Aus-
tralian cities are in receipt of £6 per week
and expect more, yet scavenging isn’t a
skilled occupation. Gas-stokers, who repre-
sent a very moderately skilled occupation,
get as much as scavengers in some places.
Slaughtermen—skilled workers yet not m
the same sense as (or in the .same street
with) the engineering expert —-already get
twice as much in various localities as the
engineering expert is asking for. and regard
themselves as under-paid. In a Freetrade
or Low-tariff country—and half the articles
mentioned on the Australian tariff list have
“Free” marked against them —the situation
is this :—-
(1) The work of the most skilled and conscientious
artisan- —the one who might be called an artist with-
out anybody noting the difference —provided he does
the movable kind of work which can be imported, is
only worth the price at which the cheapest outside
worker will produce similar work or a good enough
imitation of it, plus the cost of freight, which is
little enough. Especially in Australia, where all the
big cities and almost ail the population are on the
coast, the protection of long sea distances is infinitesi-
mal. If, say, Chinese or Japanese goods were exported
in cheap Chinese or Japanese ships to a Freetrade
Russia or Austria, the vast and expensive railway dis-
tances would still protect the worker at Moscow or*
Vienna. But this country is differently situated.
(2) Therefore, no matter how rich the Freetrade
country may be, even a Benvenuto Cellini, and the
man of that name was at the top of the tree in
many portable arts, is only worth 355. a week if
Sambo Cellini or An Sin Cellini is doing the same
work in a dead poor country at 30s. The local man
may have been the genius who invented arts and the
foreign one the copyist; it makes no difference.
(3) At the same time, the scavenger, the gas-stoker
or the undertaker’s mute is worth £l2 a week (or
£2O) if a sympathetic Government like that of Pre-
mier Ryan in Queensland orders that he shall be paid
that much. Gas, scavenging and burial can’t be im-
ported. The practitioner in these lines may get £l2
a week even if the country is dog poor, so long as
paper money can be printed or foreign money bor-
rowed. The revolutionary Government in Russia, in
its early stages, when it was just like an Australian
Government and hadn’t become a raving lunatic,
proved this. The factories which turned out skilled
work were closing by dozens, but the scavengers in
the big cities had their wages put up to £6OO a year.
So Australia has some well-paid industries
or industries that have every chance of
being well-paid which are necessarily local —■
slaughtering, shearing, street-sweeping, funer-
als and the like. It has parasitic or semi-
parasitic industries like the building of un-
profitable public works with loan money and
the growing of wheat (for local supply or
export) which is carried at half-cost on the
railways. It has industries of the engineer-
ing kind which deal partly with work that
can’t be imported—fitting, repairing and so
on—and partly with work which can be
imported. These may command high wages
so long as the people concerned are few and
are Content with fitting and patching, and
abandon all idea of expansion until there is
a better tariff. And there are a few com-
petitive industries like clothes-making, which
struggle along with insufficient Protection
because they depend largely on girl labor.
Here ends the sermon, with the demand of
the Amalgamated Engineers for increased
wages as the text.
The Precaution of Doing Something—
or Nothing.
“Mujik” : Acting Prime Minister Watt
gives as one of the reasons for extending the
War Precautions Act that the public credit
lias to be protected. Perhaps he is right.
Possibly someone can extract a meaning from
this observation. Whether or not that is the
case may matter nothing. The idea of pass-
ing an Act to assist the nation in winning a
war, and to pass it some more to assist the
politician to protect the national credit after
the war is over, is bizarre enough to be
certain of a majority support in such a
Parliament as the Commonwealth is inflicted
with. And the further notion of protecting
the aforesaid credit with a regulation must
naturally appeal with great force to a Minis-
try which, on all the available evidence, has
mighty good reason for objecting to stand or
fall by an examination of its protecting
operations while the war happened to be
raging and the credit was in the
balance. On any rational conception of
Parliamentary and Ministerial responsibility,
the time became more than ripe with
the closing of the war for a very critical
examination of what the Ministry had been
doing to the nation’s credit while the lid was
on and the gag in daily use. Apparently
Watt yearns to keep the lid on indefinitely
and achieve economic victory or whatever he
has in view by exercising the authority of a
financial dictator. The glimmerings of what
has been done to the cashbox in Australia
during the last few years are a mighty long
way from being a guarantee that protection
of Australia’s pocket by a regulation is going
to be any more complete to-morrow than the
same operation was yesterday. Meantime the
public interest in the Watt protectorate is
not made any less by the War Precautions
Act, nor have the citizens of the Common-
wealth forfeited their right to know what
sort of precautions are being taken by Watt
from getting into a hole. What is Watt
going to do about the plain, obvious facts in-
cidental to the national £? When he
explains that he is going to extend the mora-
torium and continue to fix prices and do
other things of that sort, he is only piffling
round a few of the trivialities connected with
the nation’s credit. There are two or three
fundamental issues connected with this
matter, and unless Watt can come to grips
with them out in the open and say what he
stands for, he is manifestly taking the pre-
caution of dodging the responsibilities of his
position. Pending the abolition of the prevail-
ing murkiness about the manner in which the
Commonwealth proposes to keep going, and at
what rate, and so on, it might be pointed out
to Brother Watt and his gifted disciple
Pearce that this word “credit” is a conspicu-
ously elusive term as applied to Australia.
Being a debtor country and one addicted to
heavy importations, the nation’s credit is
determined in the main by the credit of the
people who discounted the p.n. and delivered
the Spring millinery, the cigar and the pic-
ture-film. So long as the other party is
solvent and Australia can raise the wind to
satisfy Cohen every quarter, the credit of
the local inhabitant remains unaffected.
But when the other party is not as
affluent as he was before and Cohen
demands heavier and heavier levies on
national production, several questions rela-
tive to the public credit begin to have con-
siderable importance in matters of detail.
Broadly speaking, a debtor nation’s credit
remains unimpaired if the people can pay the
debt charges. Whether they live on a
meagre diet of vegetables and go clad in a
loin-cloth and an expression of fatalism are
points of no bearing on the stability or other-
wise of their credit, provided they keep then-
payments going. But if they ever get to the
point of borrowing to stave off the creditor,
then their credit begins to have a dubious
aroma. Now, Australia is not at that
point nor anywhere near it. But Aus-
tralia is at a point when the ques-
tion of whether the nation’s credit can
much longer he made the sport of
reckless politicians—of whether the people
are going to maintain their credit and at the
same time retain their standard of living—
are questions which cannot be solved by regu-
lations nor by the precautionary manoeuvres
of Watt to avoid explanations. Australia is
to-day spending over four millions a month on
war out of loan and nearly two millions out
of revenue on pensions, interest, etc., arising
out of war borrowings. There will be more
loans without a doubt —70 or 80 millions and
an undischarged debt to Britain. The total
indebtedness now of the Commonwealth is
£288,901,757 —the annual interest bili
£11,816,066 —the cost of pensions, repatria-
tion and so on, £9,813,536. The debt is
growing. So are the charges. So, too, are
the State’s debts. There is easily in sight a
Commonwealth debt of £360,000,000, and
combined debts of £730,000,000, with an in-
terest bill of £30,000,000. The amount taken
from the public by taxation now is
£89,000,000. By the end of next year the pay-
out will be at least £45,000,000. Australia
can afford this, though a lot depends on the
price of wool and meat and metals. But
Australia cannot afford this if the coun-
try clings to the lunacy reflected in
the import figures of recent years. If
the attempt is made to do both things—that
is exchange £7O-worth of goods for £75-
worth of other goods, paid for with a £75
p.n.; to extract the £45,000,000 of revenue
from the accumulated credit maintained by
postponing payments for imports—then
something will burst with great suddenness.
It will be Australia’s credit, and no regula-
tion on earth will save the situation. The
only method of rescuing the nation from the
wreckage will be by doing what ought to be
done now—stopping the multitudinous leaks,
getting to work and producing our own
necessities and cutting down the importa-
tions to the vanishing point. There are
many ways by which a country can
maintain its credit and the standard of
living common to its people; but taking in
one another’s washing is emphatically not
one of them when an outside creditor is
waiting for a settlement at the end
of every month. Does Watt imagine
it within the bounds o'f possibility
that Australia can pay £45,000,000 in
taxation, import vast masses of unpaid-for
manufactured goods, allow the national
assets to be juggled with by seven Parlia-
ments, and retain the standard of citizen life
indefinitely? If he does not, can he see
anything for it but resort to either (1) a
policy of quick industrial development or
(2) vegetarianism and the loin-cloth?
Creeping behind a veil of secrecy and issuing
regulations and listening to Millen maunder
about the superfluousness of new industries
and fixing serio-comic prices solves nothing.
The necessity for getting a move on in
honest daylight looks fairly obvious to
reasonable Australians. Treasonable Aus-
tralians, of course, have their own views.
A Small Man and a Muzzled Continent.
The daily blather of Hughes concerning
“Australian opinion” and the “views of the
Dominions” in relation to peace terms is
tiresome. That the Commonwealth should
be represented by Hughes at all is in itself
unfortunate. But the matter is made worse
by his impudent claim that the people of
Australia associate themselves with his
vocal performances in England. Hughes has
no accredited justification for the proclama-
tions he is making about “Australian senti-
ment.” On what ground can he base any of his
numerous allegations concerning this senti-
ment? From the day he succeeded Fishek
until the date of his last migration—all
through the Conscription campaign and the
months of frowsy scheming which followed
—political power was used to throttle
discussion in Australia about war and
about peace. Hughes’s yarn was always
the same: “Our duty as Australians is to do
as we arc told.” He said this not once,
but many times, and with a view to mak-
ing it certain that few could talk but
himself induced Parliament to pass some
of the worst features of the War Pre-
cautions Act. Since then there has never
been a chance for Australia to speak with
freedom. None of the problems incidental
to the conduct of the war and to terms of
peace have at any time had proper consider-
ation even at the hands of the Legislature.
From every possible point of view Hughes
is out of keeping with the Commonwealth.
Most of his life he has been a truculent
Freetrader and an opponent of Protec-
tion. Now, like nearly all sudden converts,
he has become an all-in zealot of Protection,
though such a picture of Protection as he
holds up about “economic war” is one
which the mass of men and women in Aus-
tralia and elsewhere would turn to the wall.
In the matter of trade Australia’s interests
are 'wholly Australian, turning primarily
upon the development of industries within
the Commonwealth. Hughes misses this
aspect of the thing entirely. He is busy
thinking all the time of “Imperial’’ trade
and raw materials for British factories. A
lot he has ever done for Australian industry
in the past! Meanwhile the spectacle of the
hurriedly-gathered-up sentiments of a Welsh-
man masquerading as the measured opinions
of free Australians is becoming harder to
bear than ever.
Preference Against Australians.
When Victorian Leg. Assembly reached an
item of £5OOO on the estimates the other
day, “for the purposes of a Bill relating to
the salary of the Chief Commissioner of
Railways,” the number of feet ready to jump
on it was limited to two —Labor-leader
Prendergast’s. Consequently the item
passed. The next thing to happen will be
the production of the bill. There appears to
be no doubt of the intention of the Ministry
to import a new Chief Commissioner unless
a suitable man can be found on the pre-
mises. And as the Ministry, if given the
option of not being able to discover the local
individual, will most assuredly fail to detect
him, the opportunity for the Assembly to
prevent this individual being overlooked calls
for earnest consideration. Matters generally
in connection with the Vic. railways are a
long way from being what they ought to be.
If not exactly chaotic they are mighty adja-
cent thereto. In many ways the service is
slovenly, haphazard and inefficient. From
top to bottom there is more muddle than any-
thing else, and the hand of the politician
rests heavily on the outfit. But the idea that
in order to secure reasonably decent manage-
ment and safe recurrent loss to the public it
is necessary to import an outsider has no
more foundation than any other manifesta-
tion of ignorant foolishness. The passion for
importing something appears to survive all
experience and to be impervious to every
argument. But in this particular case oppo-
sition to the imported potentate rests less
upon objection to an outsider because he is
an outsider than upon a State giving evi-
dence of its own incapacity to run railways,
and of the incompetence of Australian-
trained railway officers. Had the Victorian
railways been privately oivned nothing is
more certain than that the management
would have been in the hands of men
trained in the service—that no job would
have been too big for the industrious appren-
tice to aspire to. A concern, whether it be a
suburban grocery, a manufacturing estab-
lishment or a railway system, which puts an
impassable barrier between the top place on
the salary-list and the next does one of the
most stupid things it could be guilty of.
Either the Vic. railways are, or are not,
capable of training men for the highest re-
sponsibilities incidental to the technical and
financial management of the undertaking. If
they are not, then the price the community
pays for State management is a long way
more than can be expressed in terms of a
balance-sheet. If they are, then the impor-
tation of a stranger is a gross affront to
every officer in the service, no matter what
his present status may be. N. S. Wales not
long ago had the mournful spectacle of a -
politician being jobbed into a billet as Rail-
way Commissioner, to the personal detriment
of every man and boy on the pay-roll, and to
the prejudice of every individual whose ser-
vice qualifications for the billet had been
carefully denied attention. What fiction
could be invented to make an Australian
ashamed of being Australian that would
rival in sinister suggestion this act of differ-
entiation against Australians contemplated
by the Victorian Ministry? This paper
knows of none. Nor does it know of any
field of human activitv where Australian
interests are not to-day being better served
by Australians than by imported articles,
whether of Welsh or other origin. Anyway,
as importing a Railway Commissioner at
£5OOO a year to Melbourne would clearly
lead to discontent, ill-feeling and resentment
in the vicinity of the Yarra, and as it is
part of the functions of the Commonwealth
Ministry to prevent the Allies hearing about
friction in Australia. Acting Prime Minister
Watt ought to wheel out a regulation under
the War Precautions Act to restrain his
unpatriotic, foreign-minded neighbors from
branding Australians as misfits and hopeless
mediocrities.
An Ant-eaten Outfit.
It is Defence-Minister Pearce speaking to
the Senate in support of a resolution placing
time-limit on Senatorial loquacity:—
Excessively lonn- speeches have done more than
anything else to discredit Parliamentary Govern-
ment. An impression is gaining ground that Par-
liamentary Government is breaking down, and one
of the causes of that impression is the long and
tortuous manner in which Parliament deals with
business.
To some extent Pearce was right—in a
trivial tinpot sort of way. The spectacle of
a body of men addicted to the mere copious
use of language has for a long time ceased
to have any edifying effect upon the popu-
lace. The frequent openings afforded by
Parliamentary procedure for the person fitted
with a twin-hinged jaw to leap up and de-
liver long verbose harangues have obviously
led to grave abuses. But it is more than
doubtful whether if all this cackle and
palaver were cut in half or quartered, or
even if anyone who spoke for more than five
minutes on end was stunned by the Black
Rod, that Parliament as constituted would
be entitled to much more respectful com
sideration than it is now. Pearce is not a
person habitually given to prolonged dis-
course. Hughes is afflicted with a capacity
for long-distance conversation out of all pro-
portion to his size and the dimensions of
whatever may be the subject of his eruption.
Yet as between a Parliament composed of
Pearces and one that was 100 per cent.
Hughes it would be a moderately bewilder-
ing conundrum to decide which would be the
greater calamity. The first would hide itself
beneath a huge silence and perpetrate
Canberras and Defence Departments in the
hole and the corner. The other would use up
the available supply of paper in the issue of
Hansards and build fully 0 ships per
annum at stupendous cost to the accompani-
ment of a Noah’s Ark assortment of speeches.
This question of Parliamentary verbosity
seems to boil down to finding the medium
between discretion and recklessness and
to the reflection that, while the windbag may
be a national peril, the individual concealed
behind a conspicuous taciturnity in debate
may be a much more sinister circumstance.
Anyway, taking a broad view, it is safe to
say that far more evil has been perpetrated
by the underground wirepuller in Parliament
than by all the blatherskites who ever blith-
ered themselves into notoriety. It is not
really the talkativeness of the politician that
has encouraged public distrust of Parlia-
ments. It is his shirkfulness and dodginess
that have created distrust —his incurable
habit of struggling to obscure evasion and
profligacy behind a deluge of language. And
he would be just as bad if he could do it in
silence. The fact is that Party Government
has made Parliament almost irresponsible—
that the Legislature has arrogated to itself
an authority almost despotic. This is the
root reason of the distrust and contempt pre-
vailing among the spectators, and that
reason will remain and the contempt will
grow so long as the democracy tries to get
democratic government through a machine

devised for other purposes and without the
initiative referendum. There is this week an
appropriate example of Parliament’s disregard
for the public and the reason why the public
looks on Parliament with the cold eye. The
present session of the Federal Legislature
was summoned for the alleged purpose of
dealing with questions of finance. The pur-
pose was kept by Watt under his thumb.
The consideration given to the country’s
financial position has been practically about
the same as has been given to Australia’s
position in regard to the peace terms. Esti-
mates covering the expenditure of £44,000,000
have received less attention than would be
given by any reasonably sane citizen to his
week’s outlay on peanuts or picture-shows.
The exhibition has been one of significance
to the public—an unanswerable justification
for looking on the Parliament and on the
whole system of government with suspicion
and alarm.
Savages and Kings.
The right-thinking Huns—that is, Huns
who made the war, yelled for unrestricted
submarining and sang “Dutchy on Top,” or
whatever the music happened to be—have
been falling on the other Huns with machine-
guns and other implements, i.e., upon the
followers of Liebkneciit, who vigorously
opposed the Kaiser’s bloodstained policy
from the beginning, voted against it in the
Reichstag, and was gaoled. And the result
of the machine-gun fire being favorable to
the right-thinking party, the proceedings are
announced to reflect the triumph of law and
order and the defeat of Bolshevism and the
protection of everything that is good and
wise in the Fatherland. Well, it may be so.
Likewise it may not. This paper suspends
judgment on the subject, looking in the
meantime wdth the eye of cold suspicion on
any claim put forward by the right-thinking
Huns to be considered more decent than
I.iebicnecht. Every blood-stained ruffian at
Potsdam loudly cursed him as a traitor
while the war was going on. To outsiders
he then seemed, as he did before the up-
heaval, one of the most upright figures in
Europe. Until more is known of what he
stands for now, and exactly what game the
right-thinking party with the artillery who
supply the news about him are up to, the
time will be ripe for not jumping to con-
clusions. So far, the most certain thing
appears to be that the out-of-work Kaiser
and his curious heir are not yearning to book
return passages back to their beloved and
fjfell-bled Prussia. The worst that can
happen to William the elder if he stays in
Holland is to get arrested and tried. The
best he can apparently hope for would be
a wallop with something hard without a
trial. As for Bill, the younger, if lie in-
vaded the old haunts just now he would in
all likelihood be put on the game-list. The
position of father and son is one of grim
hilarity, and it is just a question whether, in
the interests of popular humor, the demands
for arrest and trial should be insisted upon.
The Bulletin has a vague feeling on its
friendly days that justice might be more
than satisfied if Holland and other countries
announced that Herr Hoiienzollern, senior,
was an undesirable citizen. Then Herr
would be compelled to disguise himself and
wander about the earth living in cheap lodg-
ing-houses, shifting with much celerity from
place to place to avoid being detected, and
afraid to go to the post-office for his letters
in case his identity was revealed. The
legend of the wandering Emperor, a clue to
whose whereabouts might lurk in every
advt. demanding “board and lodging with
quiet Christian family,” would become a
contemporary and historical jest. And in
time to come the historian of 1018 will be
glad of something to jest about, even if it be
the exit of a murdering, blaspheming king.
The R.C. Church and the Rectangular
View of Things.
In a sense the Watt Government was right
when it refused to admit Roman Catholic
priests to Sydney Quarantine Station. The
demand for admission w r as absurd on mathe-
matical principles. Any honest rectangle or
parallelogram, attending his mother in her
last moments to see that there i s sufficient
cubic feet of air in the bedroom, would have
realised the absurdity. This is the position
put in few words :
(1) There was a disease divided into three
principal categories, A, B and C—C being the kind
by which one died to a certainty, and turned
black after death, and required to be buried imme-
diately.
(2) There was a bit of ground with a fence
round it.
(3) On this bit of ground, for reasons too
numerous to be explained, but known to persons
who study logarithms and decimals, it was con-
sidered advisable to crowd the victims of the
disease, and attempt, their repair. They were also
put there to prevent them spreading the disease
and increasing the bill for repairs. (There exists
a rectangular theory that population should be
saved because population is useful to grow wheat
with which to feed population. Therefore, in a
way, it is an asset —still, if there was no popula-
tion there would be no need for the asset. Thus
there is a hole in the theory somewhere.)
(4) Doctors and nurses were admitted on the
sound principle that if one doctor asset or one
nurse asset died in saving fhree patient assets, the
State was two assets to the good.
That was the mathematical position, and
barring the question as to whether there is
really any need for anybody it was sound if
properly applied. But people are sup-
posed to believe in religion, and there
is one Christian sect which takes its
religion very seriously. People are sup-
posed to believe in a Hereafter —a place for
the soul to remove to when it is crowded out
of its old slum tenement; and there is one
sect which believes so firmly in this Here-
after that it wants to have a minister of its
faith to see it over the border. It is so sure,
rightly or wrongly, that there is a border and
a very narrow one, that it doesn’t fit into the
rectangular scheme of things. One reason
assigned for the non-admission of Catholic
priests to the quarantine area, where dying
Catholics were begging for their presence,
was that the father, if admitted, would have
to remain and take all risks, and would add
to the congestion of population. To which,
it was answered that fathers in general were
prepared to take all risks, and a priest
would make no appreciable difference in
the congestion. It might have been
added that his removal to quarantine
would reduce the congestion in the city
outside—a subject on which town-planners
are much exercised. It might further have
been added that the priest, as a strong, sus-
taining influence to those who believed in
him, might have as much value as a nurse on
the principle of being a life-saver. His value
to the dead might be a gamble in the opinion
of non-Catholics. His value to the living
might be a gamble, as all faith-cures and
mind-cures and other cures are—barring per-
haps amputation of the head, which is cer-
tain. But it is a poor, mean, dry, wooden-
minded clod with a rent-collector’s soul and
a parish-beadle’s instinct who won’t gamble
except on a certainty. What the Watt
Government is up against is the feeling
that it is a dog’s trick to hit a
friend even on mathematical principles when
she is down, and Nurse Egan, whose case
attracted special attention, was a friend in
the widest sense of the term. The vaunted
Good Samaritan who took no risks isn’t in
the same street with the nurse. The Minis-
try hadn’t even the saving grace of logic in
its lack of reason. One of its pleas was that
if Catholic priests were admitted ministers
of other denominations, which are many,
could claim the same privilege. So they
assuredly could under the same conditions.
Where there was a patient of any faith who
regarded the presence of his particular brand
of cleric as a necessity, instead of as a habit
or a bore or a matter of convention or an
affair in which any sort of cleric would do,
one cleric of that denomination should have
been admitted, provided there was one in
existence —a great many of the minor sects
mentioned in the census list don’t possess one
—and provided the reverend gentleman was
willing to come. On a rough calculation,
which may be verified by the Government
Statistician, the demand would haye been
.001, which is a very small decimal, and the
supply .00002, which is even smaller. Con-
sidering its plea, based on its mocfk-alarm
lest clergymen of all varieties should wake
from their previous calm and rush the in-
fected area, the Watt Ministry is out of
court as a logarithm or even as a hypothe-
neuse. Its rectangle is all out of shape.
♦
Losing by “Economy.”
More of the wrong sort of economy is about
to be practised by the complaisant John
Bowser, Vic. Chief Secretary. For many
years the three biggest towns in the State,
outside Melbourne, have each had two fac-
tory-inspectors, and the conditions amply
prove that this number is inadequate; yet
Bowser now proposes to reduce the number.
The proposal is lacking both in justice and
commonsense. Take Ballarat’s case, for in-
stance. Since the war started, the town has
moved ahead in several industrial directions,
and employs over 8000 factory-workers, toil-
ing in 1600 different establishments. The
abolition of one inspector’s job there will
mean the halving of the other man’s effici-
ency, the doubling of the number of accidents
and offences and the quadrupling of indus-
trial unrest. Bowser ought to know all this
quite well, and so should Treasurer McPher-
son, another redoubtable economist. It
is hard to understand how on earth the
pair can reconcile this retrogressive cheese-
paring with their attitude towards the brazen
waste of public money involved in such
matters as the continued weekly loss of
£5O or £6O on the Parliamentary refresh-
ment-rooms.

“Oh ! Oh! Delphine! !” arrived with all its
exclamation marks at Her Majesty’s (Syd-
ney) on Saturday. It’s a big, quick show
bright with uniforms (including the red
trousers of French Army tradition), and the
chorus gents, wear real swords and draw
them gallantly in the sacred cause of pictur-
esque effect. The cheerful blueness of the
story makes for gaiety. There are two
young men who have swapped wives
by the divorce process and have met
to begin their term of military ser-
vice under the same commanding officer —a
prancing old beau who pursues and besieges
everything in petticoats. The rich and senti-
mental old uncle the’s purely a stage fiction)
arrives earlv in the first act, and
his young artist-nephewi, to make a
million-francs legacy safe, is forced to
pretend that he and his divorced wife
Delphine are still sailing in company,
whereas she is really the wife of his fatuous
friend Bouchotte, a typical French buffoon.
Bouchotte is presentable enough in civilian
dress, but a grotesque and pathetic figure in
his French private’s uniform. Once in the
army he shambles sulkily through the rest of
the musical farce while his new wife is made
love to by her first husband, and the wicked
c.o. prances in the offing hoping for the
worst —and the best. The sky-blue plot
keeps clicking right through the three acts,
and if the two intervals could be shortened
the summer playgoers up aloft would not
grow impatient (though the fine Coleman
and Upward “sets” are very elaborate and
worth waiting for—if you can go out for
fresh air and a cool drink while the stage
staff are sweating over them).

Gladys Moncrieff, as Delphine, has a part
that fits her self-reliant manner better than
Katinka did. She is always on hand with
the required top-note, and her enunciation is
clear. Florence Young has a difficult job as
the gorgeous Persian woman Bimboula who
doesn’t know her customers’ language, but
nevertheless succeeds in selling a carpet to
the amorous old soldier when he thought he
was merely being called upon for the usual
cheap flirtation. Leslie Holland’s stormy

ending to the affair is one
of the best comedy
touches in the show. Reg
Roberts tenors as the
curly artist - nephew
Jolibeau who travels with
six beauteous models. The
part suits his languid
methods. Olive Godwin,
as Simone, ex-missus of
Bouchotte, present spouse
of Jolibeau and lifelong
rival of Delphine, is odd
wife out, and has to pass
the evening in a storm of
jealousy. She gets one
rest while singing “The
Maxim Girl” —-a brisk,
daintily-scored number
with male chorus. Addie
Lennard, perfectly made
up as a bad-tempered
fashion-plate of 1867 or
thereabouts, flounces on
to the stage, sniffs scorn-

comedy exit, walking
rapidly like a clockwork

skirts. Phil Smith gets
his laughs easily as the
simpleton Bouchotte, mis-
erably defiant in the
midst of sentimental in-
trigue. His ill-fitting red
trousers with boot-tops
sewn on are some cos-
tume-designer’s master-

She married him. Two hours after she
detected him kissing someone else. So she
bolted, filed an application for a decree nisi,
wrote to her friends that she was a widow,
and bought appropriate millinery. Six
months later she is invited to join a
house-party at the seaside. One of the other
guests is the husband alleged to be dead. It
transpires that, instead, he is a duke. Also,
that he married her under an alias, or some-
thing. Anyhow% she insists upon him remain-
ing dead. He insists upon wanting to be her
husband, and complications are introduced
by the arrival of a dispatch announcing that
the decree had been made absolute. How-
ever she doesn't persist too emphatically on
the ducal demise, and the trouble ends by the
pair getting married at 2 o’clock in the morn-
ing, and the lady letting down her hair and
turning out the lights. This is the general
outline of the career of “Nobody’s Widow,”
revived by Muriel Starr and co. at the Cri-
terion (Sydney) this week. The play is
pretty thin, rather conventional in the

Duke of Moreland,
the dear departed
whose demise was
a rumor; and
Betty Jackson, the seaside hostess.
The others merely drift in and out,
making remarks about nothing in par-
ticular and smoking cigarettes. Of the
three, Norma Mitchell as Betty has the
better sense of humor. Muriel Starr, of
course, plays Roxana with intelligence and
resource, but it is not in parts like this that
her talent finds its greatest scope. One can-
not help thinking how much more at home
she would have been had her duke been
assassinated by a motor-car on the honey-
moon, and she had arrived at the beach to
fill the bungalow with woe and lamentation
and discover the driver of the murderous
implement leading her favorite niece to the
altar of matrimony. Frank Harvey, as the
duke, is acceptable—sometimes. In his
lighter moments, though, there are occasions
when any claim by his Grace to be the
descendant of someone who crossed over with
Norman William would be open to grave
suspicion, except on the assumption that in
late years there had been experiments in
marriage with the proletariat. The Widow

The J. and N. Tait Repertory Co., at
the Palace (Sydney) had another full and
enthusiastic house last week • for the second
performances of “The Pigeon” and “How
He Lied to Her Husband.” Both plays
seemed to have improved with keeping.
Gregan McMahon’s acting was notable, and
he seemed to have put a still finer edge on
his portrayal of the French vagabond.
Eardley Turner revelled in his part of
Timson, ex-cabman and rum-tippler, and
made it real to the last stagger; while
Esther Mitchell was decidedly brighter and
more vivacious as the Cockney flower-seller.
John De Lacey was a less noisy .T.P. than
before. He made a better entrance and got
more out of the part. The rest of the cast
gave an excellent account of themselves.
The success of Gregan McMahon’s reper-
tory plays to date has been so great that
the management has decided on a regular
season of nine nights and three matin§es,
beginning on Saturday, December 14. This
will give the co. the chance it needs; and
no one who wants a good show should miss
them. This is probably the beginning of
bigger successes; but there is quite enough
at present to go on with.

“Everybody’s Doing It,” now on the job
at the Tivoli ( Sydney), is trying to solve the
old theatrical problem: How to Live W lth-
out a Suitable Comedian. C. H. Workman,
a capable actor in liis line, nils the bill in-
termittently; but half the time he leaves the
impression that it could have been bettei
done by a more agile man. One of his
comedy successes is as the aged Mrs. O Mara
in "The Soft Soap Scandal,” a back-yard
slanging match between two wash-tub
toilers. Lottie Sargent is Mrs. McQuibble,
Workman’s shrill and hysterical adversary.
The humorous efforts of J. Vincent W bite,
Wm. Valentine and Frank Greene need to
be regarded with a friendly eye; it isn’t
altogether their fault, for they haven’t much
to work on. Florence Fox, who offers some
assistance in comedy scenes, is a cheery girl
with a friendly smile but not much voice.
Fayette Perry has quite a lot to do besides
her usual sweet-village-maiden and little-girl-
in-the-nursery acts. Unfortunately, as soon
as she steps outside these juvenile lines of
business she doesn’t score well. As a
typiste in a business sketch she lacks force.
Same remark applies to her acting partner,
Hugh Huntley, while J. A. Lipman, as a
sort of Abe Potash, misses fire constantly.
His fatherly business of spanking the full-
grown Huntley in a moment of fond frenzy
is a scream of the wrong sort. Jean Keith
and tin? Tivoli Kiddies help the show along,
as do Elsie Parkes and her dancing girls.
The Ballet of the Fans is a graceful inter-
lude with well-chosen music; but Elsie’s solo
dance in “By Beach and Palm” (a vivid
setting by Whaite) suggests nothing in par-
ticular, and the orchestra is merely noisy.
Mabel Holmes solves the problem of dancing
on the roof of a grand piano while Witt and
Sang get off some ragtinfe. Peggy Peate and
Adrienne Ainsworth (singers), May and
June (mirror dancers) and Jose Baptiste
(dancing violiniste) are other shapely sup-
ports of the bill. Jose is a clever show-girl,
who helps out her fiddling with a quaint cos-
tume and graceful attitudes. She uses her
eyes more than her bow. The Clints and
Grist share the scenery with Whaite, and
there are several color triumphs.
At the Palace (Sydney) on Friday, Dec.
13, when the Commercial Travellers’ Asso-
ciation and Actors’ Association hold a
“Court of Injustice” in aid of the Children’s
Hospital and the three big metropolitan hos-
pitals and the Actors’ Benevolent Fund, the
skeletons will be dragged out of the cup-
boards of certain hitherto-respected citizens
and rattled until the necessary quantity of
“dust” drops out of them. There will be some
weird charges and equally weird defences.
Well-known mummers will be the court staff
and Bench, and the “prisoners” will be
rounded up by sixty commercial travellers
disguised as policemen, who will scour the
city in motor-cars. This is the last warning
that hoarders of skeletons will receive.
“The Death Dance” at the Crystal Palace
(Sydney) is another form of the sex problem,
with Alice Brady as leading problemette.
Waving an attractive leg and arm in a
joyous saraband she attracts the lasting love

A Sydney side-show :
The exhibition of ex-Bombardier Waller’s spirited
war sketches in Anthony Horderns’ Art Gallery
is something akin to a boom, perhaps be-
cause prices are conspicuously low. Purchases
amounting to £250 were made within 48
hours of the first visitor’s arrival. From a collec-
tor’s point of view the best of Waller’s work —
that which deals with active-service conditions in
France —will in 20 years be regarded as almost
priceless. The lucky buyer who owns “Artillery
Disembarking at Le Havre” paid only five guineas
for it. For remarkably clever sketches of war-time
types such as “A Digger,” “A Hairy,” “A Deut-
scher,” or “Padre,” the artist who lost his right
arm in the service of his country asked only one
guinea apiece. Needless to say he got the amount
quick and lively. A colored almanac, with
a silk ribbon and a few steals from the
poet’s corner, often costs much more. The
National Gallery had the wisdom to secure
five pictures of historic interest; but the Trustees
are not accustomed to be bustled when Australian
art dangles at hny such exhibition. A suggestion
from them that certain of the exhibits should be
“submitted” for their approval was politely
brushed aside by Horderns’ gallery management.
Willing buyers were standing alongside, even lay-
ing hands on the goods lest they might be whisked
off the wall. So the Trustees made an unaccus-
tomed spurt, and secured for the nation such vivid
memories of the great war as “A Tank in Action,”
“Heavy Howitzers at Noreuil,” “Re-capture of
Guns, Bullecowt,” “To the Ambulance,” and
“Chocolate Joint, Albert.” The last-mentioned is
a delightful sketch of an Aussie trying to bargain
on his fingers with an old French woman, whoso
chocolate “shop” is a mere remnant of something
that has been blown to smithereens or thereabouts.
“Toast and Scandal” (trench life on the Somme)
is a scene which the Australian has done justice
to and to himself. Mervyn Napier Waller was born
25 years ago.

The Anderson melodrama co. at the Tivoli
(Adelaide) is about to take a rest after over
two years of successful work. It has revived
a long string of famous old plays, mingled
with some poor new stuff. The last piece
was “The Confession,” in which, by way of
a change, the usually villainous Fitzherbert
was falsely accused, the usually heroic Hast-
ings was a kindly priest, and Stanford was
the real murderer. “Business Before Plea-
sure” is jqst starting at the Royal. Stan-
hope is moving on from the Majestic, with
his budget of sketches of curiously childish
Yankee humor. A strong, well-balanced
variety team is just coming into the Majestic.
The jolly Scarlet Gaieties are in the open at
the Exhibition and warm evenings have set
in to greet them. Pictures have been rather
painfully on the “strong” side—too much
of the painful Past and (as cited by one
management) the “paramour.” By way of
contrast was “Stella Maris,” at Wonder-
graph, in which Mary Pickford, in- the part
of the charity waif, shows that she can really
act; height, expression, even (apparently)
features are a contrast to those of the usual
Mary appearing as Stella in the same play.

The state of affairs in “Sweet County
Kerry” is occupying Allen Doone for the
last week of his season at the King’s
(Melb.). Fate, with the assistance of one
Valentine Hav. causes an interruption to
Allen’s liberty in this minor disturbance.
Charged with hoarding pikes, with a view
to puncturing the King’s uniform, he is
lodged in a gaol and sings at and badgers
the brutal soldiery while momentarily ex-
pecting the worst to happen. No rebel of
’9B ever faced the prospect of losing his
footing on a British gallows with the light-
hearted equanimity of Allen Doone, but
then Allen’s spirit is invigorated by Norah
Drew. Norah is also the fancy of Hay
aforesaid, so that impossible miscreant has
good reason to yearn for the extinction of
his rival. But Doone escapes and marries
the girl, largely through the foolishness of
the English soldiers. When other means
fail, good old English stupidity is always
available to save the hero from perishing
miserably.

A modest production of “Maritana,” by
the Victorian Opera Co., is the week’s attrac-
tion at the Athenaeum (Melb.). The small
Athenaeum stage compels the Marquis de
Montefiore to live in a palace about the size
of a dog-kennel, and the restriction on the
space allotted for Don Caesar’s prison makes
that tenor feel that the ordinary tinned sar-
dine has comparative liberty of action. The
alleged chorus of 40 voices adds appreciably
to the congestion in the other scenes, and
they have occasionally to give an imitation
of pressed beef to leave lanes of exit and
entrance for the two or three principals. The
chorus generally warbles with a respectful
eye on the conductor, but its affectation of
professional nonchalance is more entertain-
ing than the amateurish perfnnctoriness that
is usually met at these shows. The band
under the control of E. H. Ilanstein is free
from blame, and the artists—especially Stan-
ley Allan (Don Caesar) and Ida Roy Ashton
(Maritana), who appeared on Saturday—
warble the old familiar tunes with the taste
of veterans. On the histrionic side, how-
ever, they are merely a woodheap. While
there are young men like Herbert Sanderson
and R. C. Gillard, who were cast as Don
Jose and the King on Saturday, fears anent
a timber shortage can be regarded as ground-
less.
Many ancients will treasure memories of
“Boccaccio” with greater tenacity after
viewing the amateur performance of the
little opera at the Princess’s (Melb.) on
Saturday. As usual, the lack of collusion
between chorus and orchestra was occasion-
ally conspicuous, and the additional threat of
the chorus to Bolshevik the score increased
one’s tender regard for the discipline of pro-
fessionals in similar circumstances. Some of
the principals, however, were not entirely
disappointing. Zoe Wenke, as a sprightly,
graceful Boccaccio, and owning a voice that
compels a critic to be merciful, deserved
fully a quarter of the cartload of vegetables
that her numerous admirers dumped at her
feet. Daisy Bindley, as Piametta, was not
grossly over-rewarded by the young garden
“HONI SOIT,” AT MELBOURNE

Archibald MeW hi nicer ( Hugh Steyne) and

she received, though her top-note needs a bit
of scaffolding to keep it from tumbling down
and wrecking her lower register. Among the
men Cyril Hamley (Leonetto), Stanley Ilor-
ward (Lotteringhi) and Jack Bell (Lamber-
tuccio) varied in their inadequacy; but the
best of the crowd was Clarence Liddell,
whose rather ladylike aplomb and precious
air of superiority were not inconsistent with
the part of the Prince of Palermo. The
make-up of Scalza, the barber, and one of
the blind beggars reminded one that there
are, more things in Heaven and the Wax-
works than are dreamt of in our biology. But
the dressing was effective and the approval
tremendous. Apparently each damsel had
dragged in grandpa, auntie or what other
relatives she possessed, to give her the con-
fidence of their uproarious enthusiasm. It
made the writer feel as if he had wandered
into a wholesale family reunion.
** * *
Hugh Steyne has succeeded Barry Lupino
as head jester in “Honi Soit” at the Tivoli
(Melb.). Steyne is a little angular in
places, and his manner is affectedly effusive,
but there are few occasions where he can be
catalogued as “interruption.” He is seen at
his best when he buries his thin features in
whiskers. A pair of Dundrearies has an
extraordinary broadening effect, and makes
him appear rounded, plump and jolly. Laur-
ence Hardinge is a new face in a few minor
places, and Charles Albert attempts to re-
place the agility which disappeared when
Lupino left the show.
These are the last nights of “Hello,
Everybody,” in Melbourne. Soon there will
be a' hollow void at Her Majesty’s, which
Williamson’s annual panto, will endeavor to
fill.

At Hoyt’s De Luxe (Melb.) this week
Pauline Frederick is suffering the rorty
vicissitudes of Ivatusha in “Resurrection,”
and is quite properly presenting the charac-
ter as a lofty martyr to the brutality of
Man. The film necessarily omits much of the
descriptive matter in the original novel, but
the telling of the tale is not too discreet
and the theme of the plot is maintained with
scrupulous accuracy. Douglas Fairbanks, as
“Mr. Fixit,” is Hoyt’s antidote to the gloomy
Russian tragedy, and the young man’s play
with three aunts and an uncle is another
advertisement for his nerve and volatility.
At Hoyt’s Lyceum Virginia Pearson seems
to be the misguided product of a Bolshevik
education in a long Russian narrative called
“The Firebrand.” At the Majestic “Good
Night, Paul.” is the prevailing topic. An uncle
who promises to settle £50,000 on a stone-
broke misogynist is the cause of some
uproarious farce, in which the smile of Con-
stance Talmadge takes full honors. Com-
pared to the foregoing, the other Majestic
theme is dark with dread. It is entitled “To
the Highest Bidder,” and details the problem
of the hard-up Venus who is ready to grab
the nearest millionaire and love and honor
his bank account.
The love story of the Boy and the Girl
continues to be lost, found and lost again
amid the smoke and high explosives of the
“Hearts of the World” film at the Theatre
Royal (Melb.). The mutual sweetness and
self-sacrifice of the two youngsters stands
out unaffected by all the violences and bru-
talities, and conveys in allegory the steadfast
recognition of a high moral purpose which
brought Britain and France together in 1914.
The film cements the alliance of the old
enemies in several striking tableaux, but
keeps the Hun at the distance which divides
this sort of animal from civilised man. D. W.
Griffith never spares the Hun in his long
tale of devotion and disaster. Whether from
commercial reasons or an outraged social

Tiie Bulletin received this serious state-
ment from a military nurse :
You are probably aware of the fact that since
the outbreak of influenza at North Head, 17 mili-
tary sisters have contracted the disease, of whom
two have died. Yesterday’s S. M. Hehalli (5/12/’18)
says that “the persistence of cases among the
nursing sisters has been engaging the closest and
most careful attention.’’ I do not think that much
attention is needed to find the cause. The nurses’
hours are too long. There are only two relays of
nurses to do the whole 24 hours’ duty. The night
sisters work* and work hard, from 8 p.m. to 7.30
a.m., and I do not consider that any nurse who
works eleven and a half hours at a stretch, at
such work, has got a lighting chance of escaping
without becoming infected. There should be at least
three relays of nurses. I will quote one instance to
show how the nurses at North Head are over-
worked. A few days ago two were sent from Rand-
wick at 3 p.m. to the Quarantine Station. They
had already been on work from 7 a.m. that morn-
ing. On arrival at North Head they were given a
couple of hours rest and then sent on night duty.
One of these women contracted influenza immedi-
ately.
■ ♦
in its large-hoofed way among
the intricacies of finance, like a blind
elephant trotting among eggs, the Watt-
Hughes Ministry has put some unexpected
features into its new War Profits, or Peace
Profits, Bill. One idea is to date back
sundry new and complex regulations for a
couple of years, so that people who have
already paid up may be called on for fresh
returns and further payments. Consequently
profits which were already divided may
prove to be bogus; and people who have
sold out and left may be chased for taxes
which they ought to have paid, though the
Law didn’t say so at the time; and estates
which were wound up may have to be un-
wound again ; and account-books which were
destroyed after the winding up may be
called for; and the ghosts of people long
dead who thought they had died honestly
may be called upon to come down or up—
at any rate to come back—and pay their
lawful retrospective debts. Possibly the
widow or the orphan or the executor or the
surviving partner may be got at in some
cases for the newly-created liabilities of the
person who can no longer be found. But it
isn’t likely that the profit will be worth
the fuss and the stationery. Anyhow, it is
an awkward precedent. When a Tudor
Government comes in it: may impose a War
Profits Tax of 40 per cent, on Federal
Ministers’ salaries, datinfe it back to the first
day of the llugiies-Watt Ministry, and
increasing its own salaries so that the im-
post won’t hurt it. Then Watt may become
introspective as well as retrospective.
The present Australian Government will
be remembered as the one that put a tax on
washing and was kicked into withdraw-
ing it. It classed public baths as an
amusement, and levied an impost on admis-
sion tickets to raise money for the salaries
of the Bureau of Science and In-
dustry, or to pay for keeping three ambas-
sadors in London, or some such thing. Pos-
sibly the Watt-Hughes Government only
washes for amusement, but many people do
it even in their serious moments, and they
weren’t struck by the Watt point of view.

Profits are gradually improving again, but
they are still about £5500 short of the aver-
age for the six terms prior to the war. W est-
ralia has not shared in the war-prosperity,
real or artificial, to the same extent as the
other States. On the other hand, its great
gold-mining industry has rapidly declined,
and its farming industries have not been
looking too well. In fact, in many cases
when Cocky has made up his books he has
found that wheat alone has not paid, and
that mixed farming is apparently the only
way out. Further, shipping difficulties have
interfered with Westralia’s timber ami fruit.
The pastoral industry has been the only one
which has done really well —good seasons and
the liighly-satisfactory arrangement with the
Imperial Government have given splendid re-
turns. But while wool and meat have pro-
vided some small compensation for the loss
in other directions. Westralia has not
shared proportionately with the Eastern
States —particularly N. S. Wales and Vic.—
in the matter of War Loan expenditure. So
while disclosed banking profits in the East
have not been affected to any extent during
the war, several recent terms the West Aus-
tralian Bank has shown profits only three-
quarters of those prior to hostilities.
Possibly something more than formerly has
been set aside for contingencies. Though
the bank is handling very little more of the
public’s money than in pre-war times, some
of the earnings—particularly on the advances
—should now be greater. But while the
slump in profits may be partly explained by
the directors having strengthened internal re-
serves, it is obvious that this Westralian bank
iias not been nearly so well situated as those
in the East. ....
Still profits have been sufficient to main-
tain the 20 p.c. p.a. dividend which has been
handed out regularly for 13 years. That 20
p.c. dividend, however, is not all it looks.
When the West was booming, this bank s
business naturally grew very rapidly so
rapidly that a lot of new capital had to be
got in. Right back to the ’nineties a 17i p.c.
div. was being paid; but instead of holders
getting new shares at par, they were issued
at a stiff premium—a premium of £l6 on one
lot of £lO shares. Those not taken up by
shareholders were offered to the public, bring-
ing in an average premium of £lB 18s. lOd.
per share. Thus some of the £lO shares cost
almost £29. So the 20 p.c. dividend on these
shares is equivalent to only about 7 p.c. But
in this way the co. was able to strengthen its
funds considerably. During the 10 years to
1912 £150,000 of new capital was got in, and
reserves were strengthened by over £229,000
of premiums.
Capital and reserves now total £973,460.
The other balance-sheet figures are shown in
this comparison, covering the four years of
war:—

Premises . . 78,000 79,200 iB,iBo
Thus the total liabilities to the public amount
to £2,764,887. So for every £1 of sharehold-
ers’ funds the bank holds only £2 16s. 10a.
of the public’s money—an exceptionally
strong position from the depositors’ point of
view. Advances made under the wheat
scheme and to enable customers to take up
War Loan have made a big cut into liquid
assets, and though the proportion of liquid
assets is considerably less than usual the
position is quite sound. To meet the
£2,016,454 of liabilities not represented by
liquid assets there are the £2,936,134 of ad-
vances and the £7S,7SO of premises. Apart
from the latter item, even if the bank could
get back only two-thirds of its advances, all
creditors would be fully satisfied.

This Australian insurance office started 33
years ago as the North Queensland
insurance Co. In 1907 it absorbed
the North Queensland Accident Insur-
ance Co., and cut the “North” out of its
title. Since then its progress has been re-
markable. In 10 years its premium income
has grown from £177,560 to £308,148, and its
funds from £158.360 to £545,698. Owing to
war risks and the N. S. Wales’ Workmen’s
Compensation Act the growth of premiums
has been very rapid during the past couple
of years, and that all this, new business has
proved highly profitable is shown in this
comparison:—•

1918.. 308,148 109,105 101,533 35.4 „ 32.9 „
The loss rate for the past year was thus
wonderfully low, and the big volume of busi-
ness cost less to handle than the smaller
turnover for the previous year. The balance-
sheet, by the way, shows the premium income.
“less reinsurance, returns and unearned,”
as £281,151. Prior to 1915 the figures
included unearned premiums. Apparently
£26,997 was added to the unearned premium
reserve during the past year, and that
amount has been tacked on to the net pre-
mium income in the table for purposes of
comparison.
During the year a further £lOO,OOO of
reserves were capitalised, making the 350,000
£1 shares fully paid-up. Ten years ago the
paid-up capital was only £75,000, and not a
penny of new capital has been since put up
by shareholders. During the past seven
years no less than £275,000 of reserves have
been capitalised. Shareholders have thus
done remarkably well; where ten years ago
they were receiving an 8 p.c. div. on their
capital they are now getting 121 p.c. on a
holding which has expanded 4§rd times its
former size. And of this greatly increased
dividend interest earnings alone provide more
than seven-tenths. Interest earnings last
year were £31,383; so the underwriting
profit was called upon for only £12,367 to
provide the feast for shareholders.
What protection does the co. offer policy-
holders? At September 30 the total funds
were £545,698, and the premiums for the
year £308,148. The funds thus represented
177 p.c. of the premium income. A propor-
tion of 150 p.c. is regarded as a fair thing;
so 377 p.c. is very good. Considered from
another point of view, the present funds are
sufficient to cover the total losses of the past
four years and £BO,OOO besides. Another
matter to be considered by the policy-holder
is the disposition of the co.’s funds. This
shows the Queensland’s investments, and all
other assets: —
Government securities . . £312,014
Fixed deposits and cash 295,224
Freeholds. . . . . . 110,918
Municipal debentures . . 45,565
Sundry debtors, etc. .. 39,441
Total £803,162
There’s not a single mortgage loan in the
list, nor any items such as furniture or
stationery.
The four war years have proved highly
profitable to insurance cos., thanks to the
magnificent work of the British Navy. Now
that the Hun submarines have been safely
chained up in British waters war risks have
practically disappeared. The result will be
a big slump in marine premiums. The
Queensland Insurance, however, is hunting
for new business abroad, and has extended
its business to California, Canada, India,
China andrelsewhere.

In addition to this 8 p.c. div. holders of
ordinary shares receive a bonus of 24 p.c.
on the amount of their purchases. The
precise amount to be handed over in this
way on the past year’s sales is not stated,
but £9OO has been estimated as about the
sum required. Net. profits are smaller than
they were just prior to the war, but this is
entirely due to greatly increased taxation.
In view of all the co.’s troubles during the
past couple of years it has done surprisingly
well. Only £ll,OOO of new capital has
been got in during the past 10 years, but
gross profits have grown rapidly: 1908,
£93.615; 1914, £116,541; 1917, £128,716;
1918, £150,041. The chief difficulty lately
has been to secure stocks, and though many
lines have been unobtainable the manage-
ment has been successful in keeping its
shelves full —at a price. The growth of
this stock item is shown in this compari-
son :

Cash, etc. . . 1,216 2,393 5,810 20,665
Apart from the increase in stock, the
notable feature of recent balance-sheets has
been the reduction in book debts.
A comparison of the latest figures with
those of 10 years ago shows that £11.009 of
new ordinary capital has been got in and
that liabilities have increased by £11,410;
total. £22,419. Meantime stocks have grown
by £79.790, £25.394 has been added to
premises and plant, £19,449 to cash, etc.,
while book debts are now £42,862 less. So
provided full allowance has been made for
depreciation, etc., the co. is now £59,350
better off than it was in 1908. In other
words, while shareholders have had an aver-
age dividend of almost 7 p.c. p.a. profits
equal to a little over another 4 p.c. on the
present paid-up capital have been left in
the business each year. By keeping the
dividends down the co. has thus been got
into a comfortable position. The only point
about which there is any doubt is whether
prices can be kept up until all the expensive
stock has been got rid of. But, again, it is
possible that the cautious Dunedin manage-
ment has made some provision to protect its
stocks against a slump in prices.

This co.’s performance for the past four years
is a striking illustration of the general effect of
war on the Commonwealth —or, more particu-
larly, on the capital cities. Nicholson’s trade
almost wholly in luxuries —luxuries which
you might reasonably expect would not find a
ready sale among a people burdened with a
share of the most costly war ever fought. To
September 30 the war had cost the Common-
wealth £199.358,299; but of that vast bill
only £27,003.361 had been paid out of
revenue, leaving £172,354,938 which had been
met by loans which have to be repaid later on.
Some time ago it was estimated that well over
half of our war borrowings was being spent
within the Commonwealth. So at least 90
millions of loan money have been scattered
about —mostly in the capital cities —during
the four war years. The result of the
artificial prosperity thus created has been
that, instead of Nicholson’s having had a cold
time, the gross profits are now almost as big
as when the State borrowing boom was at
its height. Here are the figures for the Sep-
tember half-years:—
1913. . £36,101 | 1916. . £26,818
1914.. 30,977 j 1917.. 31,860
1915.. 24,607 1 1918.. 35,586
The directors are apparently satisfied that
the present conditions are going to last for a
while', too. As “the result of the deliberate
policy of the Board, in view of the prevailing
uncertainty in regard to both shipping and
manufacturing facilities,” the directors six
months ago considerably increased stocks —no
doubt, at stiff war prices. Also, a very large
t.p. business is still on the books. This com-
parison shows the balance-sheet movements
over four years prior to 1914, and during the
four war years :

Six months ago the directors considered it
good policy to acquire a freehold, and this
purchase, together with the piling-up of
stocks, accounts for the recent increase in
liabilities. But from the above table it will
be seen that an amount equal to the whole
of the paid-up capital and something besides
is represented by the sundry debtors item ;
and of that £130,423 represents time-pay-
ment balances. So long as times are good
and customers can maintain the payment of
their small weekly instalments this t.p.
business is highly profitable. On the other
hand, if things turn out badly the co. is
liable to have a lot of soiled goods thrown
on its hands, which would be difficult
to unload until conditions brightened again.
There is a danger, too, in the heavy stocks
purchased at war prices. However, Nichol-
son’s are not in a business in which there
is a considerable amount of competition* so
even were the shipping difficulties, etc., over-
come earlier than anticipated the co. is pro-
bably in a better position than some people to
maintain prices until most of the costly
goods have been sold. Still the future is
uncertain. Within a few months the scat-
tering of a million of loan money every
week on the war will cease. When that
bump comes and the public begins to feel
the pinch of the huge interest bill, the
demand for pianos and other luxuries is not
likely to be brisk. Whether Nicholson’s have
made substantial provision for contingencies
The Bulletin does not know; but. anyhow,
shareholders will be very fortunate if the
10 p.c. dividend can be maintained through
all the trouble that is ahead, considering the
narrow margin between profits and the div.

Gordon House is a “model lodging-house”
which this co. took over from another co. 15
years ago. Besides providing a cheap, clean
bed. the co. gives shareholders a good return
on their money. Capital is £15,470 in 18.200
£1 shares paid to 17s. Properties stand in
the books at £26,262 and furniture, etc., at
£lOOO. To finance the undertaking the co.
has depended upon outside money, which it is
repaying very slowly out of surplus profits.
This shows the position:—

Since 1910 the co. has thus improved its posi-
tion to the extent of an average of £3OO per
annum. The mortgage debt is now £BOOO, so
there is a long way to go at this rate before
the load is entirely lifted.

The approach of summer makes it imperative for
every stock-owner to give a thought to the purifica-
tion of drinking water for his stock. If he is content
to let them drink muddy, slimy water he cannot
expect them to keep in good condition. All over the
State careful stock-owners are using Aluminoferric in
the proportion of one pound to every 2000 gallons of
water. It ensures pure liquid water in dams, wells,
tanks, etc., at very low cost, by precipitating all
impurities and leaving the water clear and pure,
free from any ingredient injurious to man or beast.

Poor Mount Cuthbert (Q.) is winded
again. Is it a coincidence that two crank
shafts of the plant are smashed up just in
time to spin out a Christmas holiday, or is
it pure bad luck? The balance-sheet shows
the co.’s position as follows
Liquid Assets. Liabilities.

debtors, etc. . . 2,501 ors . . . . 22,382

Even if the original debentures be deducted,
there is still a gap of £lB,OOO that has to be
tilled to get assets and liabilities into line.
With copper down something will have to
happen to get the show on the road it ought
to have been travelling for two years past.
Labor should have given it a chance while
Britain was ready to pay for the yellow
metal. The copper turned out last; half-year
was 1426 tons, and as costs were £140,488, it
took about £lOO per ton to cover working
charges, refining and realisation. So things at
the mine have to alter, either in the direction
of cheaper costs or in the sending of . better-
grade ore. to the smelter. But is the latter
possible? Reserves are given as 120,000
tons containing 7800. tons popper. That is
0 p.c., and while this is a good deal lower-
grade than the run of the mine whs expected
to go in the old days, still Oorbould’s record
at the Elliott may give hope that; if labor
assists, tlie corner should be turned. Whence
a ray of sunlight pqeps is in' (he matter of
developments at the Ivalkadoon and the
Orphan ihines. At the latter claim is a
shoot 800 ft. long and about Oft. wide, run-
ning about 10 p.c. copper, while both at the
150 ft. and -250 ft. levels of the Ivalkadoon
high-grade ole is being developed. Poor
though the balance-sheet ' position is, the
mining .situation is far from depressing. In-
cluding fluxes, the co. to date has smelted
3264 toils blister copper from 66,000 tons ore
and fluxes, and now has the smelter going
on monthly campaigns .that range close to the
300-ton copper mark.
,*, . * *
Hampden-Cloncurry shows a considerable
decrease; in reserves of direct smelting ore,
the latest, estimate being 133,000 toils of ore
containing 11,000 tons of copper. Assuming
90 p.c. is recoverable, the actual reserve is
9900 tons of copper. In addition there are
98.000 tons of concentrating ore containing
2920 tons of copper, from which, on an 80,
p.c. basis, 2336. tons of metal are' recover-
able. Including customs copper 41,707 tons
of fine metal have been produced by Hamp-
den. Reserves of less than 10,000 tons of
recoverable, copper from direct smelting ore
are small compared with a capital of
£350,000. The position can be improved
only by expending more money on develop-
ment,.
Hampden-Cloncurry doesn’t call itself a
railway, co., nevertheless it has ex-
pended altogether £111,994. on. tramways
that carry ore and fluxes to the smelters.
The recently-completed Trekelano line cost
£24,940, and during the twelve months to
August 31 the sum of £42,374 was laid out
on machinery, tramways and buildings. This
large sum spent out of the year’s profits
helps to explain why dividends were so
long delayed. At August 31 the co. had a
surplus of liquid assets amounting to
£215,948, equal to over 12s. a share. Of
this surplus £124,930 represented storts,
fluxes and fuel, some of which were pur-
chased at high prices. Deducting the value
of stores, etc., the surplus is £90,018, most
of which is represented by copper products
on hand or in course of realisation, and
valued at the full contract price for refined
mfetal.

The 204 tons stone treated at Mt. Dudley
(N.S.W.) gave a net return of 1920 z. gold.
Including the gold absorbed by the batteries,
the return is just an ounce to the ton, which
is well-paying, since half-an-ounce is reckoned
to cover expenses. The first clean-up is not
regarded as a fair criterion of what is at the
lower level, 1 since a quarter of the stone
treated was from the dump at the main-shaft
mouth created by A. B. Ivirkman, the pre-
vious holder. The next accounting, due just
before Christmas, should tell the tale with
more exactness. Two shifts are being worked,
and the rock drills are now in action. A big
body of stone is immediately available in the
tunnel going south, in which for the present
work will be concentrated. Specimens
brought to the surface from the face of the
drive show free gold assaying high values,
but nothing but wholesale treatment of the
anticipated 400 to 000 tons a month will
settle the great amount of current doubt.

From “Nightshift”: —
Mount Dudley bears, and their name is legion, with
a keen scent for the shortness of scrip, have scared
shareholders with yarns to the effect that the dis-
trict is patchy,” “the reefs don’t live down,” and so
on. And yet, according to Mines Department records,
rhis little field up to 1906 produced six'tons of gold,
and Wilson’s reef down to 600 ft. gave crushings
yielding from soz. to 7oz. Mount Dudley is not.
in the Trunkey district; it is in the Kempfield area
—quite a different matter. Trunkey has produced a
number of small rich reefs ranging from 9in. to
18in., in a very hard-slate country rock. When
reaching water-level, as a rule, the primitive miner
was flooded out, and abandoned his claim. Similar
• stone to Mount Dudley has never been seen in
Trunkey. Again, the Kempfield country rock is gener-
ally a very soft slate or felsite. The Kempfield reefs
are big bodies of ore, which increase in size with
depth, ranging generally from 2ft. on surface, to
Archie McKellar’s recent find, “The Colossal,” which
on the surface measures 40ft. at least, and is gold-
bearing throughout. Further, crushings put through
by Kirkman previous to the Mount Dudley
Co. taking possession are declared to show “a fall-
ing average, that is, the first crushing was the best
and the last the worst.” Well, here are the figures:
50 tons netted .. .. £3Bl

A further treatment of 196 tons and 45 tons blanket-
ings yielded a net return of £7 16s. per ton. Some
o { above crushings were put through at Cockle Creek,
but the majority by Ivirkman’s “ricketty-raeketty
5-head battery.” Granted Kirkman picked his ore
(there - could • not have been much picking), the
above record speaks for itself. Now, as regards the
‘‘falling average.” There were 25 tons of “culls” at
grasSj which went lldwts. And this is the peg on
which the “falling average” is hung.

Yields have been on the sliding scale in
Bendigo for the last five years, as the follow-
ing returns for the first 11 months of each
year shows: —
Gold, oz. Gold, oz.

* * * *
Bendigo Amalgamated averaged 9dwt. last
fortnight for 4110 tons, including plates; and
if that does not pay the fault lies in the big
outgo on development and the relatively
small tonnage crushed in comparison with
the number of shafts at work. The strike at
the Constellation at 723 ft. is in time to save
the reputation of the field. The west leg
stone is good grade, and: the big cap is'
giving fair, tonnages of pay-dirt. The cut-
ting of the shoot at 622 ft. adds to reserves.
The Great Northern crosscut has run into the
same lode at 509 ft., so that with the opening
up also done at 890 ft. in the Constellation the
staff is easier about future battery supplies.
At the Johnson’s No. 3 shaft the co. is root-,
ing about on the Derby line at 1225 f- Here
out of the west leg of a saddle a 7dwt. trial
lot was followed up by a lOdwt. yield. Only
small lots Went through the mill, but if the
cap of the shoot shapes well another decent
find will have been got since the Hun was
put under restraint. Alongside, in the Coil-
man’s, a lot of good stone was stoped in the
old days, and as Johnson’s is such a big:
claim old hands always look to it to come
out on the right side.'

Rescue work by Ituwolt’s Collingwood
foundry got Teddy Miles’s Katoo Deebook
out of the mess it was plunged into when a
monsoon got to work on the craft carrying
the boilers 'of its dredge from the aban-
doned ground at Renong to Penang. That
plant was exchanged for an interest in a
dollar tin co. registered in the Malay Straits,
thus avoiding all the nasty inquiries that
Commonwealth Treasury officials put when
a float or a reconstruction is on the cards.
This new Taiping co. has a register of
1,500,000 shares with 200,000 in reserve, and
it is diving into an 800-acre block which
Miles says is good enough to flounder in with
one dredge for the next 15 years. Teddy
Miles and son Temple Miles are to draw
Board fees in Melbourne, where E. J.
Kennedy hopes to write divvy cheques for
the next decade or two, provided that the
show doesn’t blow out as soon as the Katoo.
The final nine months’ run at Renong gave
124 f tons oxide from 397.789 cub. yards, so
that the average was ll|oz. oxide per cub.
yard. The working profit was £1912, most
of which went to test new properties. Apart
from its holding of 425,000 shares in the
Taiping Co., the Katoo has oddments of cash
and sundry debtors amounting to about
£4500; so that there is plenty to keep the
wolf from the door till the dredge gets to
work on the Taiping claim.
An, official list just out shows that West-
ralia now possesses 444 live gold-mines, but
only a few are big. Kalgoorlie is reckoned
to have 52 producers, Murchison 06, East
Murchison, Mt. Margaret, Yilgarn and Cool-
gardie between 40 and 50 apiece, and North
Coolgardie 37. The remainder are distributed
over eight other fields, while three others,
Kimberley, Ashburton and Gascoyne, are not
credited with any at all. Out of the whole
444 less than a dozen art turning but nine-
tenths of the present output. The men em-
ployed in the industry have dwindled from
about 16,000 to under 9000 in the last
decade, and of these over a third are em-
ployed at Kalgoorlie.

New Commodore (W.A.) seems to be fol-
lowing the footsteps of the old Commodore.
For a time the market, was propped up by
official reports and by the statements of the
consulting engineer or someone else as to
what was likely to happen when the con-
tinuation of “the rich shoot” in an adjoin-
ing show was struck in Commodore ground.
Hut as nothing happened, shares slumped,
and the public, was left lamenting. Recent
assays cannot be regarded as satisfactory,
and probably the best tiling the Board could
do would be to get an engineer of some
standing to report on the venture, and say
definitely whether it is worth while carrying
on.

Westralia is somewhat excited over the
discovery of an alleged new coal-field in the
south-west, about 50 miles inland .from Bun-
bury. Four bituminous seams having a
vyidth up to 44ft. are said to have been
found on the slope of a hill, and a hand-
kerchief-full of samples brought to Perth
are declared to be much heavier and better
than Collie coal. The locality of the find is'
not far from the Collie field, and is in the
centre of what is described as a “wide area
of coal-bearing strata.”

The old Rothsay mine at Yalgoo (W.A.)
threatens to again obtrude ■ itself on public
notice. Originally floated in 1896 as Wood-
ley’s Reward it swallowed up a lot of London
money, but after falling far short of pros-
pectus expectations it was eventually closed
down. Years after the now defunct Bull-
rdsh co. acquired the plant for another delu-
sion, and since then the show has been
pegged and abandoned several times.
* * * *
Edna May Consolidated Extended ' (W.A.)
is having another go. The workings have
been unwatered, the plant titivated and sink-
ing resumed. The co., it seems, is building
on some prospecting done by the Edna May
on some blocks adjoining improving its
chances, which at present look extremely
blue.

“Redoubt” : The discussion by metallurgist
A. W. Dye on platinum (B. 5/12/’18') is.
both interesting and inconclusive. The
miners are not yet so insane as to blame the
“English firm referred to” for the drought,
nor are they becoming cross with any local
refiners of platinum who are searching old
molars for platinum supplies. What the
miners are interested in getting is an open
market for Australian refined metal. By
Australian refined metal I mean metal pro-
duced in Australia and refined here, such as
the Fifield product. The Fifield miner has a
right to kick if the nice clean metal he pro-
duces becomes merged into a scrap metal
trade. A beginning has been made in Aus-
tralia with the refining of the Fifield metal
on a basis which will enable Australian
refined platinum to make just as good a
name for itself in the markets of the world
as the copper of the E. R. and S. Co., or the
lead of the, B H. P. Co. 'The Electrolytic
Co., at Port Kembla, and the B. 11. P. Co.,
at Pirie, did not begin their refining career
by delving into the scrap-metal business. I
can quite conceive that the English firm
referred to will not mind how much of the
Fifield stuff becomes mixed in process of
treatment with scrap-metal picked up in the
dental rooms. More work for 'them. The
English firm referred to are dealers as well
as refiners. For general information it
may be added that the miner now has an
opportunity to demand a fair thing for his
product, because there is competition for it.
As a consequence, he is at this moment get-
ting a fair thing,' but the .competition cannot
be maintained if the Federal Government say
in effect: “There shall be no open market for
your products” ; and “You must allow every-
thing to pass into the hands of the
English firm.” The non-payment for
osmiridium is to the miner not a technical
matter at all. It’s just simply an item of
cash consideration. The open market will
establish payment for osmiridium, notwith-
standing anything Mr. Dye may say to the
contrary.

Passed out, Regimental-Sergeant-Major
Basil Tavender, D.C.M., of the Maoriland
Instructional Staff, at Christchurch by pneu-
monic influenza. He gained distinction on
Gallipoli, and was one of four sergeants-
major decorated by Birdwood at Codford
camp (Easter, 1916) and selected for duty in
M.L. as instructors to reinforcements. Ilis
only brother was killed in in 1917.
All available strings will be pulled by the

CAPTAIN
MAC ART HER,
Hobart
Harbor-master.
Mayor Glover, of Adelaide, has been re-
elected without opposition (all the city rate-
payers have a vote on the subject) for another
year. Incidentally, at Quorn, a northern
country township of S.A., Robert Thompson
lias taken the mayoral chair for a long lease.
He has mayored for .17 years, and the towns-
men have just requested him to keep going.
Stuart Reid, of Eddington, Camperdown
(Vic.), who died the other day at 73, was a
fine old crusted Conservative. Eddington
has been in the Reid family’s posses-
sion for many years, and the property
gave the old man plenty of leisure for
other matters than watching the wool grow.
In the intervals of following this comfortable
job he used to write a good deal on political
affairs from the stake-in-the-country view-
point. Some of his articles, written at great
length, were printed in the old Melbourne
Review. That paper’s readers were mostly
of the sort which likes to read the kind of
article written by the make of citizen who
mixes politics with his sheep-breeding; so
Reid had no difficulty in getting into print.
He was at heart a good Australian, and had
lived in the Western District for 66 years.
“Copabella” puts in a word :
Though his self-managed publicity department
arouses laughter, postal officials pay tribute to Web-
ster as a P.M.G. who has really done things. There
is, they say, a distinct increase in efficiency since
he took charge. He has permitted a certain amount
of devolution of duties and would if he could give
more responsibilities to heads of big offices and in-
spectorial districts. But always he comes up against
the dead wall of bureaucratic custom, stubbornly
blocking any attempt at reform. The Chief Docketeer
and staff begin to stiffen if there is any talk of
altering the file method of investigating a com-
plaint ; likewise, the Head Stamplicker and staff,
if it is proposed to curtail the spending of ten
sliillings-worth of correspondence on the threepenny
job; also the Arch
Carpenter, should a
country P.M. want
to buy a nail and
drive it himself;
and the Brand
Registrar stands
on his hind legs
if the Sealing-wax
inspector wants to
use his own judg-
ment in putting

official at Black
Dog or Dead Fin-
ish. Cries of
“You’re trying to

GREGORY,
M.H.R.
( Da[?]pier , W.A.).
Davenport Hoggins’s two stretches in the
Assembly have been too short to get
him into much trouble. As an “elocu-
tionist” he has travelled Victoria, Tas-
mania and Maoriland depicting, chiefly,
Dickens’s characters. He works overtime to
brighten up Tasmanian politics, and any
man who does that deserves the Australian
star. In between whiles he is managing-
director in the Mainpaint Co., Ltd., which is
working the deposits of pigment in the Der-
went Valley.
Passed out the other day at Boulder,
Westralia, Michael Balfour Scott, able law-
yer and literary man. Born in Tasmania,
he early qualified for the Bar. and after a
year or so working as Associate to the late
Justice Clarke he practised in his native
State. In 1899 he started at Boulder, where
he chased Costs and learned goldfields life
from top to bottom.
“Mustard Gold”: Of Westralian members
oc the Senate, Paddy Lynch, retaining all
the exterior of his toilsome days and rolling
out a sonorous brogue, is easily the most
striking personality. De Largie is easy and
fluent, but you hear him with a tired feeling,
with a sort of conviction that he should
have moved off the political stage to make
way for something fresh. Needham’s chat-
tering flow of pawky Scotch is wearisome;
Buzacott looks about with an owlish eye,
breaking occasionally into a sing-song mono-
tone which drives members into the refresh-
ment-room ; and old Geordie Henderson,
once of the Collie coal industry, seems to be
eternally thinking out a speech to be deli-
vered some day in a better world ; but his
perpetual yawn indicates that he will be
too tired when the time comes. Paddy Lynch
retains his old habit of fixing his gaze on
some individual in particular when in the
throes of oratory. Years ago, when address-
ing the inhabitants of a Westralian town
on old age pensions, he fastened his gaze
on an ancient man who bore the reputation
of being the prospector of the field and its
wealthiest capitalist. After dwelling on the
benevolence of the pension institution. Paddy
yelled, still glaring at the venerable pros-
pector: “No man should be ashamed to take
the pension; it’s his by all the laws of right
and justice.” “Look ’ere,” snorted the
target of Paddy’s flashing eye, “don’t you
git chuckin’ off at me. I don’t want no
old age pension!” And no amount
of soothing explanation could calm the feel-
ings of the outraged patrician.
“Bill Bowyang” writes :
If he was not killed after I left Palestine the
ending of hostilities on that Front saved the life of
the most death-defying Billjim I ever met. On the
Peninsula he earned a reputation as a bomb-thrower,
and when his unit returned to Egypt he was
appointed instructor at a grenade school, but his
reckless juggling with bombs of all kinds put the
wind up on his pupils and they refused to come within
a mile of him. Afraid that he would finish by
blowing some of his comrades to pieces, his O.C.
transferred him to the A.S.C., and when I met him
some months back he was cooking for “Sloper’s
Cavalry” in the Jordan Valley. In spare time he
strolled around the surrounding landscape and
generally returned with a bag of grenades or unex-
ploded aerial bombs which had once been the pro-
perty of the enemy. These were scattered around
his dugout, under his bed and in the fireplace,
and his chief delight was pulling them to pieces
and studying the contents. One evening while
experimenting with a broomstick bomb his com-
rades around the dump at the foot of the hill heard
a deafening explosion, and when they hurried to
the cook-house they found the bomb expert sitting
amongst the wreckage of the kitchen and the half-
cooked dinner. “Struth I” he said sadly, “that was
stiff luck ; there was some sort of new explosive in
that bomb and I don’t know where to find another
one.” In a brain-vacuum I accompanied him to the
Wadi Quelt (the Biblical brook Cheroth), and
while we were standing on the brink of a rocky
pool he produced a Mill’s grenade from his shirt
and pulling out the pin hurled it into the water
below. When I woke up I was outlined amongst
a clump of reeds several yards to the real', whilst
Bill was plunging about in the- pool and throwing
scores of stunned fish ashore. He was a great
fisherman, was Bill.
A Crimean veteran passed out at 83 at
Lidcombe (N.S.W.) last week. This was
John Bates, who served in the war against
Russia as a farrier in the same cavalry regi-
ment in which his father was a farrier-major.
After the Crimea the Bates family came to
Sydney, and for many years father and son
carried on business in Parramatta-street
(now George-street West).
Henry Houghton Burton Bradley, dead
recently at 73, was a solicitor (since 1867)
of the Tulkinghorne type, as was his father
before him —they had a purely family busi-
ness. Dad, Henry Burton Bradley, came to
N. S. Wales in the early ’thirties with Judge
Burton, who was understood to be his uncle,
and to whom he acted as clerk, or associate
(ranking as second clerk in the Supreme
Court Offices), until 1840, when he was
admitted to practise as a solicitor. The son
just dead was partner, and the business is
still carried on as Bradley and Son, in the
same old shop in Margaret-street. The house
in which he died is somewhat historic. It
was the residence of Admiral Philip Parker
King, in which he died suddenly in the
’fifties.
“Gallery”: The faculty of being right-
thinking with the utmost ostentation has
enabled Edmund Jowett to win some notice
in the House of Reps. A sheep baron and
an Imperialist, he is readiest to rise in
vociferant enthusiasm on behalf of propputy,
place and privilege. Never has he ventured
an idea that could not be adopted by the
Argus. Never has he uttered a word that
had not the tone of the ruling caste. Next
to sheep, caste has his entire moral support;
and he also professes a great and valiant love
for the Union Jack. Jowett’s regard for the
emblem transcends the deep respect usually
felt by the ordinary citizen His eminence
among the mutton-magnates and clubmen
demands that he should show a superior
idolatry. Wherefore he exalts the Flag in
speech and interjection at every possible
opportunity. It is alleged that lie has the
Jack stencilled on the backs of his sheep;
hut, of course, that may be merely idle
rumor. Naturally his flourishes of tlie red,
white and blue annoy the Red-flaggers on the
other side of the House, and when they
respond by metaphorically waving their rag
in the face of the foe, the mutual defiance
almost spills over in personal biff.
Major Wilfred R. Snow, D. 5.0., M.C., son
of Francis H. Snow, of Aldgate, South Aus-
tralia, is home after three years active ser-
vice with the Royal Flying Corps on the
Western Front. He is 25 years of age, and
bachelor of engineering of the Adelaide
University. The young man wants to “knock
on the head” the idea that the aviator is a
super-man. “The actual flying of the
machine,” he said, “is no harder than driving
a motor-car, and the aviators have an infi-
nitely better time than the man in the
trenches. There is no airman worthy of his
salt who fails to take off his hat to the
infantry.” Members of the Flying Corps
went up for four or five hours a day, and
the rest of the time they spent as they
chose, playing tennis or billiards, riding
horseback, etc. Snow will not talk about his
rapid promotion or distinctions beyond say-
ing that “some men were lucky, and he was
one of them.”
ALL OFF!
“Every brewery in the United States closed on
Saturday as a step towards nation-wide prohibition.”

“Well, ’Erbert. I was thinkin' of goin' to

That great reformer. Samuel Mauger, is
back in Melbourne after a brief trip to the
U.S. lie left Australia, according to report,
as an honorary commissioner to inquire into
the penal systems of the U.S. on behalf of
the Vic. Government; and, according to the
Vie. Government# —but what’s the use of argu-
ing? Anyhow, Samuel left with something
of a clatter. If he came back with a report,
so far it hasn’t proved to be a particularly
noisy one.
The oldest inhabitant of the South-West
(Western Australia) is W. J. Roberts, of
Connelly-plaee, Capel. lie is 90 years
young, and as hearty as you like. The
old pioneer landed from the ship Dia-
dem in April. 1842, and for 7(i years
has been on the job improving Australia.
He is an ardent loyalist, and the decisions
of the last Perth Conference so annoyed him
that lie had to be restrained from eating the
babbling pacifists without salt.
The real name of William Smith, who
passed out in the Victorian Old Colonists’
Home the other day, at the alleged age of
100, was Roberts, and he is understood to
have been related to the warrior who warned
Bull what was coming to him if he did not
adopt conscription. He came to this country
as botanist with Hobson’s Rattlesnake ex-
pedition, which explored the country west of
Port Jackson. Devonshire was liis birth-
place.
“Ingelara”: “Country Ped” (B. 5/12/18)
deservedly celebrates some brave Melbourne
lads. Aibury (N.S.W.) discovered a good
specimen the other day in Algie Roach, a
crippled boy of 16. Another 3 G-year-old
named Williams was running along the
bank of the Murray when he tripped over a
set fishing-line and falling into the river was
soon in difficulties', being unable to swim.
Roach dived in, fully dressed, and after a
fierce struggle with the drowning boy suc-
ceeded in hauling him ashore. Young Roach
was greatly hindered by his crippled leg and
the fast, treacherous currents of the Murray.
In case it hasn’t yet been reported, I recom-
mend the case to the Royal Humane Society.
A PRIVATE CITIZEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“1 do not desire to return to Russia, save as a
private citizen.” — Kerensky.
I, who lately swayed the crowd,
Spared no labor; talked so loiul
That the whole earth heard my word
Keen and pointed as a sword,
I desire to stand with men
As a private citizen
When I reach my native shore—
Only this and nothing more.
I have watched the kingdoms fall,
Heard the mobs of Europe bawl,
Seen the blood begin to flow,
Watched the flres of ruin glow;
And the man who boldly stood
Earned but little gratitude
From the private citizen
When he rose a man of men.
1 would bolt and bar my door—
Only this and nothing more.
Bare they loot and bold they rob.
Kings grow weary of the join
Putting statecraft to the touch
Is a task that costs too much.
While I yet can save my skin,
Milder praises would I win;
Feed the pip* or soothe the hen
Like a private citizen;
Keep the wolf without the door—
Only this and nothing more.
Wolves are playmates I dislike.
Here the Labor Unions strike
In a mild, and gentle fashion
Moving sorrow and compassion;
And a statesman at his ease
Docs whatever he may please.
But in Russia’s bloodful sink
You can die before you think.
Punctures come with no remark
In the light or in the dark.
Therefore, as a man with men,
And a private citizen,
Let me say that I deplore
Everything—and something more.

SOCIETY
The der-anged situation of Sydney’s Quar-
antine Station, within a few yards of a
fashionable suburb, has raised a storm now
that a particularly ghastly epidemic is at
the door. The Federal Government is blamed
for not removing the evil thing to Broken
Bay or some such safe place, and it is
pointed out by people of the Billions Club
variety that the valuable site would sell or
let for a vast sum of money, so that a profit
could be made by removal. Which is quite
true. It might be added that the sites of
the Treasury, the Education Department,
the Lands, the Public Works Office and many
other things are immensely valuable, and
that they don’t yield a penny of revenue
while the State occupies them. If the Quar-
antine Station was moved to Broken Bay
and the State capital was shifted to a cheap
town like Orange or Armidale the proceeding
would, bar mismanagement or sheer rob-
bery, be a highly payable business. The
Quarantine Station was planted where it is
on the principle that everything, even dis-
ease, must be brought to Sydney, and if
there happened to be a big epidemic on cen-
sus day it added a trifle to the population
and dignity of the metropolitan area. The
Commonwealth inherited the establishment
and its traditions, and nothing very violent
has been said on the subject till now. Just
at the moment violence is useless, for the
sick patients can’t be removed and put in
tents or caves by the Hawkesbury. When
the excitement is over and removal is pos-
sible the subject will probably be forgotten.
It is like the hole in the roof which doesn't
matter in dry weather and can’t be repaired
in wet weather without exposing the plumber
to the risk of pneumonia.

“Grand Fleet” : Jellicoe and Beatty burnt
a lot of coal trying to coax the German
Navy out. One impressive coat-trailing on
November 19, 20 and 21, 1916, cost Von
Tirpitz a light cruiser and a couple of mine-
layers, and was within call of developing
into the biggest sea-fight in history. Six of
our best ships, including battle-cruisers, left
on the 19th, and to the delight of all headed
straight for Heligoland. It was a “Jutland
day”—fine with a light mist. After the
squadron passed the Dutch lightship on the
North Dogger Bank, a thick mist came
down, and they picked up a number of mys-
terious wireless messages of which the offi-
cers could make nothing, as only the chiefs
knew the battle plans. The ships tore on at
21 knots until they were pretty close to
Heligoland. Then they turned and headed
for home, hoping to Heaven the Germans
Were following. At midnight the decoys turned
again and headed back towards the Huns,
who were expected to be well clear of their
base. Just at dawn smoke was reported on
the port beam, and in a few minutes the six
had joined up with the Grand Fleet—a mass
of ships stretching away to the horizon to
port and stern. If the Huns had followed
determinedly we could have engaged them
then; but there was nothing doing. It
turned out afterwards that one of our battle-
cruisers had been a trifle too eager, and the
Huns had retired before her. Arrived back
at the base after four and a half days’ steam-
ing-

“Centurion”: It is news to read (B.
28/11/’18) “Camelero’s” contention that the
Camel Corps captured the Baharia Oasis in
the Libyan Desert. Writer saw the road for
armored cars being built between the oasis
and the Western Egyptian border, and the
blockhouses built as the road was extended
and manned with Imperial infantry. The
only troops mentioned officially as taking part
in the capture were British Yeomanry and
the armored cars. “Camelero’s” statement,
also, that the Camel Corps pulled the Light
Horse out of a tight place at Romani and
Bir-el-Abd is ridiculous. The Camel Corps
took no actual part in the Romani-Katia-Bir-
el-Abd actions. When the Ist and 2nd L.H.

Brigades, with the Maorilanders, rode 60
miles across the Sinai Desert in midsummer
to try and cut off the Turkish retreat after
the big defeat at Romani and Katia, the
3rd L.H. Brigade and the Camel Corps were
to attack the Turkish right flank, while the
Ist and 2nd Brigades tackled the left. The

blooded Australian troop-horses did on their
heads. As a result, the Ist and 2nd, with the
Maorilanders, heavily outnumbered by Turk-
ish infantry and outgunned by the latter’s
field and howitzer batteries, had to draw off
after 14 hours’ stiff fighting. The Camels
first came effectively into action in Sinai at
Magdhaba and Rafa, and did good work from
there on. As mounts, the camels are not in
the same street as the Australian troopers.
They are infinitely slower, far harder to con-
ceal, and difficult to shift quickly. Among
the soft sandhills they are at a great disad-
vantage. Their chief recommendation seems
to be the amount of water and rations
they can carry for their riders.
A superiah English officer once declared
That Australians lacked aptitude for a naval
calling. Well, at a recent exam, for mid-
dies on a British battle-cruiser, in the
written exam, for seamanship, gunnery, navi-
gation, engineering and torpedo work, an
Australian youth, who, by the way, had
scored over 90 per cent, of the marks in the
oral exam., averaged 82 per cent., securing
three firsts and two seconds, the first prizes,
where he was runner-up, going to two other
Australian lads. The rest of the bunch also
started.

“Camelero”: We were just about to roll
into our blankets one evening in the Jordan
Valley when a stranger dressed in shirt and
shorts strolled into the camp. “How’s
things, boys?” he said. One of our ser-
geants recognised the interloper, and sur-
prised us by answering, “Fine, sir, and all
these coots reckon that you will do us.
“Yes?” said the visitor ; “and by G you
chaps will do me. Good-night, lads.’
“Good-night, General Allenby,” saluted the
sergeant; and then we tucked down more
comfortably.

The Allies—including Australia- —have
not yet finished relieving the war-plight of
the French and Belgian children, but the
fact need hardly blind this country to the
needs of our own waifs and orphans. Ever
since certain unhappy disclosures were
made concerning a well-known orphanage at
Brighton (Vic.) a few sensitive people
have had an uneasy feeling that not enough
public attention is being paid to Australia’s
own motherless mites. Thousands of mar-
ried soldiers have gone to the Front, and
many have been killed. The State is sup-
posed to be looking after the children of
these men ; but it must not be forgotten that
the State is supposed to have exercised a
personal interest in the orphanage above-
mentioned. So that the children of dead
soldiers shall not suffer injustice and priva-
tion through the inattention of those who
may fail in their duty, it would be a proper
and comradely thing if married soldiers who

have come back to their families, their chief
patriotic duty done, were to seek representa-
tion on the controlling boards of the various
children’s institutions throughout Australia.
Such representation could best be obtained
through some of the returned soldiers’
organisations, and should be insisted upon.

WHEN MY SHIP COMES HOME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a suggestion afoot that men of the
merchant service who have served throughout the
war on vessels carrying foodstuffs and other neces-
saries for the Allies should be paid a bonus.
They’ll go tramping down the sea roads
In the same old dreary way,
Whether waves be calm and smiling
Or the bridge a-swill with spray;
Hut they’ll miss some of the faces
That in memory they keep —
Good old friends of ocean’s highways
Sleeping sixty fathoms deep.
We’ll be making for our berthings
Just the same as ’fore the war—
Down to load-line or in ballast,
Grimed with coal and splashed with tar.
I.oad again, and lift and drive her —■
Cabled orders from the firm—
Captain cursing, mates a-sweating,
Chief too mad to swear or squirm.
Food or cattle, wool or phosphates—
Anything, it’s all the same
While the trips can show a profit.
What’s the odds? It’s in the game.
Lately dodging Fritz’s U-boats,
On strange courses half the way.
Now, it’s “Hup, you blighters. Work her I
Won’t you ever earn your pay ?”
Over four years in and outward,
Keeping, “Sparks” alert and spry.
All lights hidden, even side-lights—
Never knew what Fritz would try.
Pleasant job to lie and wonder
In your bunk when up she’ll go,
With the Old Man cracking hardy
And the engines rung “dead slow.”
Yes, we’ve taken heaps of chances
And come through them all serene.
’Taih’t no consolation thinking
Of, perhaps, what might have been.
Now, they’re waking up the Channel—
Lights abeam on either hand—
Looks like old times there in Loudon
Striking midnight in the Strand.
Lots of talk and tales in papers
Of “Britain’s seadogs” (somewhat lean) ;
“New page in our island story
By the mercantile marine!”
Lots of guff, but soon forgotten.
Common sailor-men are we;
Not signed on for “the duration”—
More like for eternity.
AVhen rewards are being handed
To the Navy’s blue and gold
We’ll be in the Islands' stowing
Stinking copra in the hold.
Common sailors, that’s what we are—
Same old me and same old you—
AVbo through four damn years of torture
Fed the Navy’s gold and blue.
Fed the Navy, fed the Army—
Fed up with the blasted strain —-
“AA r atch on deck” and “Keep your eyes skinned!”
Turn and turn about again.
Talk of giving us a bonus—■
Talk is cheap. My oath, it’s free!
I’ll believe about that bonus
When the cheque is paid to me!

GET IT TO-DAY.
Premier Lawson, of Victoria, is again
“considering” the doctors-and-lodges dispute.
Some lodge managements have been rendered
excessively bitter by being reduced to going
over the “remnants” of the sawboning-trade
to select a man who will sacrifice his stand-
ing with the B.M.A. for prompt cash pay;
and the drain on the funds of districts lack-
ing their own doctors continues to be a
serious circumstance. One of the anomalies
of the position to-day is that, though friendly
society members pay a regular medical-fee
into the funds any contributor falling ill
and needing attention, in a district where
there is no lodge doctor, has to have 10s. (kl.
in cash ready for a B.M.A. man when called
in. Otherwise the doctor remains deaf to
the call. Out of this half-guinea the patient
parts permanently from a small amount,
varying from Is. to 3s. Gd., according to his
district’s arrangements, the lodge refunding
him the balance some time after he presents
his bill. Some lodges have enough of such
accounts, still unpaid, to paper a room. It
means, of course, that if a “financial” mem-
ber hasn’t a spare ten-and-six when taken
ill, though he may have been paying into
his friendly society funds for years pre-
viously, he must go to a public hospital.
This is an ill-adjusted business, and even the

“0.L.”: Ex-Gaud Mayor David Hennessy
suggests the opening-out of a square in front
of Federal Parliament House as an Aus-
tralian war-memorial. Hennessy would pull
down the old White Hart Hotel in Spring-
street, where the doorsteps have been worn
thin by the mighty feet of generations of
Parliamentarians, and knock down a row of
other valuable properties in the neighbor-
hood. Another proposed plan is the erection
of a monument on the lines of Nelson’s
column in Trafalgar Square, London. Either
of the proposed memorials, though it would
cost a lot of money, would, of course, be in
existence long after the last of the returned
men had gone to join his fighting mates in
A r alhalla; but it would be just as well to
ask the surviving soldiers themselves for an
opinion on the matter before doing anything.
Most of them would probably be found to
support the postponement of the plan for a
couple of decades. By that time, if the
country proved to be solvent, and if there
were no returned men suffering privations,
and if all the families of the fallen continued
to be prosperous, the matter might be put
to a popular vote. Any more hasty and un-
considered action than this would hardly be
fair to the parties most intimately concerned.
“Honoring” soldiers by spending a lot of
borrowed money on an unproductive work,
of no value whatever to the men themselves,
is a crazy business.

When the United States army entered
Treves (Germany) the Hun population, it
is recorded, met them with “sullen, glower-
ing faces.” It was different in the French
city of Lille during the long horror of the
Hun occupation. There every woman
smiled and bowed when she saw a Hun
officer in the street. That was part of the
regulations, and if a woman failed even
once vengeance was liable to fall not only
on her but on her family. So many a lady,
who would have cheerfully faced a firing-
party if she alone had been concerned, pro-
fessed gladness, for her children’s or her
mother’s sake every time one of the mon-
strosities came into her line of vision.
From The Bulletin’s raw-edged war-
rior :—•
In the way of dinkum excitement give me a sudden
order received by a unit resting miles in the rear
of the firing-line to proceed at once to the Front.
Take, for instance, a certain attack some months back
by the Tnrko-Germang in the Jordan Valley. We were
camping under canvas at Kantara when we received
orders to entrain. This, by the way, is the regi-
mental and classic word for scrambling into a horse-
truck. When there are 42 troopers in a truck and
everybody is cursing and growling and sitting on the
end of their iron rations, the train makes a start, and
we take it in turns to breathe, commencing from the
right. We went around Sinai and Palestine several
times. I can take my oath on this, because I began
to recognise some of the inhabitants after th e third
time around. These
evolutions were per-
formed in order to de-
ceive the enemy’s in-
telligence staff, who
at the finish was not
quite sure whether
we were going into
the front line at
Cairo or to occupy the
supports in the Gulf
of Riga. By the time
ye reached Jerusalem
we felt in the mood
to go six rounds with
an A.S.C. horse. On
the way to Jericho we
halted at a brigade
dump and proceeded
to load up properly.
I knew that the
arsenals of England
had been mighty busy,
but I had no idea
that they made so
much stuff as 1 was
detailed to carry. By
the time the brigade
had finished with me
I was a wonderful and
inspiring example of
what the munition-
workers of Great
Britain could do, and
an anarchist would
not have . approached
me with a flash-lamp.
These brigade people
filled our pockets with
bombs and flare-
lights. If a chap was
unlucky he got a sack of
trench-mortars. I happened to be an N.C.0., so I gave
my lot to a private. Add a rifle, bayonet equipment and
300 rounds of ammunition, and we had just about
reached the Plimsoll mark as an explosive force. The
motor transports all being in use, we had to follow
a donkey-track over the Judaean hills until we reached
the front line, where we found, to our disgust, that
the Maorilanders had repulsed the enemy’s attack
and that our assistance was not required. To make
matters worse, we had to carry all our gear back to
the brigade dump. That settled it!

In Melbourne to water the streets now
there are permanent hydrants in many
places, and to these the municipal hoser
screws his nozzle, and then plays a
copious stream over the highway and" such
foolish pedestrians as are not ' capable of
getting in out of the wet. The other day
one of these combinations was in full swing
in Collins-street above the Argus office,
when a wild-eyed, hatless man came bound-
ing from an adjacent edifice, and seized the
apparatus, as if imagining that he could bear
off the terrific spray, ejaculating wildly:
“Quick, quick, lend’s your hose. A lady in
the church has fainted !”
PEACE CELEBRATIONS.
ASTOUNDED STRANGER: “Bloome!”

“R. J, Pip”: Somewhere on that thin
black line across the map of France and
Belgium, which for so long seemed as
elastic as a gaol wall and represented the
Western Front, is the wraith of a champion
German machine-gunner who watches over a
line of decayed trenches. The soul of such
an artist as he was could never desert the
scene of his great work. We got
him as a legacy from a battalion of
Maorilanders on a strip of the fine
in Flanders, and received injunctions
from the departing tenants of the
warren that when he began to perform we
should keep our heads down. They passed
on the exact times at which he would get
busy each night and morning, and told us
that he always delivered a steady stream of
bullets two to four inches (no more, no
loss) above and along our front-line parapet
for some hundreds of yards. Thus we were
introduced to “Parapet Joe.” At first we
thought our legs were being pulled. But
experiments with old dixies and bits of
trench timber produced beautiful results
like the separating perforations between
postage stamps. So we kept our blanky
heads down all right, and mentiofied him to
the artillery.

“Oyo” : Some Bulletin contributor lately
suggested that at the final peace celebrations
our boys of the Camel Corps be
allotted a place in the procession
mounted on humpies. There
should be no trouble in finding
sufficient of the smellful brutes
to carry the Cameleros; but
what a merry time it will be if
they join in the parade ! If only
one camel comes within a mile
of Sydney I can see all cab-
ranks turned into circuses,
bi’oken-down rabbito steeds doing
even time through shop win-
dows, horses and carts at the
Quay climbing the iron railings
into Port Jackson, and Sussex-
street a nightmare of waving
hoofs and flying produce. I’ll
guarantee that any old moke,
broken-down enough to be sold
for Zoo meat, will turn inside
out on getting one whiff of a
camel. If he gets half a look at
one ~.,11 i. c 11
one he 11 pull a ton at full gallop up tbe
Post Office tower.
I'j. : Suburban vendettas are sufficiently
numerous, although they are usually lacking
in the brilliant advertising features of the
Corsican drama. However the climax of the
Weever and Dunstan feud in our subsidiary
suburb has just been reached, and is worth
mentioning for the neatness and originality
of Mrs. Weever’s attack. The Weevers and
the Dunstans used to be great friends,
although a new' dress in either family was
always a sore and touchy subject in the
other one. Then the
Dunstan’s got a
motor-car, and their
elder daughter mar-
ried a prosperous
land- and - estate
agency, and envy,
hatred and all un-
charitableness sepa-
rated them perma-
ncntly from the
Weevers, with the
result that each
family employed its
leisure devising
schemes for bringing
confusion and grief
u pon the other.
When the Dunstans
gave a party to cele-
brate the coming of
age of their eldest
son the other night,
the Weevers came
t o the conclusion
that the whole thing
was a wicked device
to spite them and
rake them with
envy; so it happened
that when the revels
were at their height
in Dunstan’s big new
ballroom, and while
bright the lights
shone on fair what’s-
their - name and
brave, etc., a sudden
cra s h. filled the
family and guests
with consternation,
and just two min-
utes later people
were pouring out of
the exits and rush-
ing in all the known
directions, to the
utter undoing of
Dunstan’s party. Mrs. Weever had taken up
a large object in Dunstan’s garden, and had
sent it hurtling through one of Dunstan’s
windows into the midst of Dunstan’s guests.
The object was a■ beehive!
“Centurion”: Pearce’s department is
starting already to make an ass of itself in
connection with its demobilisation of the
attested troops in camp at Liverpool and
other places. These men are being turned
loose, with the proviso that they may be
called up again if needed, and are being told
to get work, no document, temporary or
otherwise, being given them to show their
standing. Thus, one concern I know of
which is always ready to give a chance of
work to any discharged soldier of decent
character, and is already doing so for some
hundreds of men, cannot give these chaps a
leg-up since it cannot take every man’s
word. Binging up the military authorities
for confirmation is about as satisfactory as
ringing up the tomb of Mahomet.
A COMMON RISK.
“He said it wets a thrilling experience when
he went ‘over the top’ in France.”

Let it be a song of life,
Life in thew and heart and sinew—
Girl, the world were worth the strife
If a deed of mine could win you.
There are mountain peaks to climb.
Let me scale their precipices,
If my guerdon be the rhyme
Of your red and perfect kisses.
There are stormy waves to mount,
Rising breast-high ’mid their roaring,
If a bath of brine may count
Tribute of my heart’s adoring.
There are battles still to fight;
And you shall not see me waver
If upon my armor bright
I may flaunt your silken favor.
Bid me go and rob a bank!
Any manly deed I’ll try on;
With a smile as fair as frank
I’ll be dentist to a lion!
Set me simple tasks like these,
Deeds of thew and heart and sinew;
But l will not shell the peas
If a dozen pods u'ouUl win you !

TRY MAGNESIA FOR YOUR
STOMACH TROUBLE.
IT NEUTRALISES ACIDITY AND
PREVENTS FERMENTATION.
Before giving up hope and deciding that
you are a qhronic dyspeptic, just try the
effect of a little magnesia—not the ordinary
carbonates, oxides or citrates, but bisurated
magnesia, which you can obtain from practi-
cally any chemist in either powder or tablet
form. Take half a teaspoonful of the powder
or two compressed tablets with a little water
after your next meal. It will neutralise the
harmful acid in your stomach, dispel the
wind, soothe and heal your inflamed stomach,
and quickly relieve your indigestion. Many
hundreds of sufferers have gained relief from
this simple remedy, amongst them Mr. P. V.
Anderson, of Cooray, Queensland, who says:
“I had suffered from indigestion for about
five years, and had tried all sorts of treat-
ment without success, when a friend advised
me to give bisurated magnesia a trial. I am
very glad I did so, for I experienced imme-
diate relief and am now completely cured of
my trouble.” Did space permit many identi-
cal experiences might be quoted, all tending
to prove that, if you keep your stomach free
from harmful acids by taking bisurated mag-
nesia after meals, you need nevef fear any
serious form of digestive or stomach trouble.
But, of course, it must be bisurated magnesia
—other forms might do more harm than
good.— Advt.

POLITICAL
POINTS
One of the long-foreseen effects of the war
is only just beginning to be felt. It is almost
impossible to buy whitewash in Melbourne
at present, so great is the demand. What
can be used as a substitute for renovating
politicians?
SPEEDING THE PARTING GUEST.
ACTING-PRIME MINISTER WATT: “There will be a
removal, as quickly as possible, of the censorship.”
THE MAN BEHIND: “’Ere’s yer ’at!”
Treasurer Butler, of South Aus., predicts
a strenuous time ahead in the efforts to keep
the expenditure within coo-ee of the revenue
for the coming year. He opines that with
the wheat yield panning out a third less than
his estimate in August (which will affect the
railway revenue) and expenditure not pro-
vided for on the estimates of £50,000, for in-
creased wages and salaries “it will be almost
a miracle if the accounts balance at the end
of the financial year.” Loans are unpopular
on the London market, and a suggested Bill
for increased taxation to the tune of
£500,000 would, says Butler, have no
chance of being passed. So the situation
certainly looks unpromising. In fact it
could hardly look more unpromising from
Butler’s point of view if he had a splinter
of brick in his eye.
This from The Nation, a London journal
of a much higher type than the Daily Mail,
concerning the Dominating Personality:—
Enter the ranting Hughes with his clique of
journalists and Lord Northeliffe as his chef d'orches-
tra. See him trample on our law (witness the con-
duct of his quarrel with the Mertons), the
conventions of our politics, the decencies ok our public
life. Watch him libel our public men (what English-
man, for example, ever spoke of Germany as “our
dear brother,” as he falsely alleges?), with his
common touch and cheap vocabulary. Letters from
Australia assure one that he has long ceased to speak
for her, and that his Premiership is an usurpation.
Lord Northeliffe has found a brother-soul, and an
intelligence that fits like a glove to his own.
Bill Adams, apparently, hasn’t won the
Battle of Waterloo yet!
“Gleniris”: The Vic. Farmers’ Union
claims to have been the chief instrument in
getting the Federal Government to make an
advance, to those who want it, of 50s. per
ton on this season’s hay-crop. The 50s. is to
be handed to the farmer in return for a
12-months’ bill, and no speculators are to be
admitted into the game if the Government
can keep them out. The scheme will give
the financially-tangled farmer a good lift,
enabling such producers to hold their hay for
the good market which is fondly expected to
arrive about Christmas-time; and the middle-
man, whose mouth has been watering in anti-
cipation of a quick turnover of the struggling
farmers’ stocks, is cursing bitterly over the
“hide” of the Government and refusing to be
comforted. Speculators lately made a big
killing in the potato market, and this fact
probably helped the Government-fo make up
its mind about the other matter. Still, it
was the V.F.TJ. which first prodded the
elephant.
Watching the decay of a rich uncle is in-
teresting to the persons concerned, and
people of a gambling turn may even get some
excitement by betting on the health of an
insolvent uncle. The question of what will
happen in Westralia is worth a mild flutter.
The deficit is now £3,192,000, or about £lO
7s. 6d. per inhabitant, which would be the
same as £19,000,000 shortage in N. S. Wales
or £15,000.000 in Victoria. The absence of
money is growing at the rate of
some £600,000 or £700,000 a year.
It would be necessary to multiply
all taxes by three or thereabouts to
stop it. and then people might leave to
avoid paying them. If many people left
there wouldn’t be many left. Nobody seems
to have any very clear idba about the future
—the future being somewhat illusive—-and
nobody seems to care much. Care is the
missile which is said to have killed a cat, and
Westralia’s wild-cat is dead already.
“N.A.”: The Bulletin (28/11/T8), re-
ferring to the growth of the Bolshevik pro-
paganda in Australia, speaks of the One Big
Union adopting certain principles including
“taking over the workshops” and “taking
over banking,” adding that a proposal favor-
ing a local defence system under which every
soldier would have charge of his gun and
keep it in the house was being “talked of.”
As a matter of fact the idea of amending
the Defence Act so as to allow every finished
trainee to retain his rifle was adopted by
the Perth Labor Conference. Delegates drew
up a set of suggested amendments of the
Defence Act to become the official policy of
the Australian Labor party, clause “m” of
which says; “Citizens, on completion of
training, to retain arms delivered to them
during training.”
The N. S. Wales Premier has stated that
he would rather be a bishop than a politician.
The Bulletin feels that way also, and
whatever assistance under the canopy of
high heaven it can render towards making
Plolman a bishop will be given ungrudgingly
as; any hour of the day or night. Sundays
or holidays, wet or dry, in heat or cold, this
paper will be found at its post ready to
speed the good work of making a bishop of
him or any old thing bar a treasurer.
It is no offence to remark that Sinn
Feiners are being elected in large number
to the British House of Commons. But if
a Sinn Feiner happened to live at the South
Pole, and ascended an icicle to address a
public meeting 75 John Hops would imme-
diately start up out of the nearest crevasse
and rush him off the landscape. This would
be done to help Britain win the war that
was over. Queer place the South Pole.
Dooley, M.L.A., whom it is hard to take
seriously, tried to amend the N. S. Wales
Venereal Disease Bill so that the compul-
sory patient would not be bound under
penalty to give the doctor his real name and
address. These details are not wanted for
publication, of course, but because the man
who is a public danger of the worst sort may
be traced if he shirks treatment and tries
to vanish with his disease and disappear
amid the mass of the community. The bril-
liant Dooley apparently thought it would do
just as well if the patient left qo trace of
himself or gave somebody else’s name and
address and let the authorities chase the
wrong man. Certainly if the proposal had
been adopted, and a patient had availed
lumself of it to give Dooley’s name and
address with impunity, that gentleman might
have wakened up. But this would be a very
slow world if it waited for Dooley to wake
up.
The Federal Government intends to keep
Australia under a sort of martial law for 12
months to come :
Three hundred thousand Aussies fought
For Liberty across the foam,
v> hile Watt had got her tied up taut,
And boxed and ironed here at home !
Vic. Labor-leader Prendergast having
asked Premier Law’son if he would see about
appointing a public prosecutor whose ser-
vices would be at the disposal of needy people,
the feeble Lawson replied that he would
look over the back fence and see what the
other States were doing. If they aren’t
doing anything, he will presumably potter
along in the same old rut. Heaven knows
how uawson would have stood the shock if
Prendergast had asked him to appoint a
Public Defender.
THE JAMBOREE.
At the last meeting’ of the North Sydney Council
it was stated that during the past week there
was “not enough water on tap to enable one to take
a dose of medicine.”
“Hullo! Going to have a party?"
“Party (hie) he blowed! Gorra water the
tomatoes; gorra take me (hic) medi-
cine; an’ wife’s gorra wash the baby.”
In an Arbitration Court plaint, Labor is
asking an award of £3 per week for 48 hours
for female fruit-pickers, practically unskilled,
and 11s. a day for unskilled male orchard
workers. But, so far, Labor has raised no
outcry about the nurses in the Melbourne
public hospitals for whom Treasurer McPher-
son is trying to get a reduction from (10 to
48 hours’ work and a lift to something ap- )
proaching a wage that an office-boy wouldn’t
be ashamed of. Nursing is skilled and higlily-
responsible work, but apparently Labor
ignores all classes of toilers that aren’t
affiliated with the Trades Hall. A well-
organised nurses’ strike against the Trades
Hall would bring the question to a head
with a jerk; but then the nurses are not
built.that way.
In February, G. F. Holden’s term of office
as Chairman of Melbourne Harbor Trust
(£l5OO a year) will expire, and it will
depend upon the grace of McPherson, State
Treasurer, whether lie will get an exten-
sion. McPherson and Holden crossed swords
when they were fellow-members of the
Trust. Holden was formerly member for
Warrenheip in the Assembly, and Bent
made him chairman of the Geelong Harbor
Trust. Afterwards he broke away from
Bent. Watt, when State Premier, gave
Holden his first appointment as Chairman
of the Melbourne Harbor Trust nearly six
years ago.
When Martin Hannah, Collingwood’s
choice, is interjecting from his place in Vic.
Assembly, one of his mannerisms is to tack
an “s” on to the word “regard” when the
letter is superfluous or something. The late
John Murray, when Premier, tried to break
him of the habit by giving him a gentle hint.
This is how be gave him a hint or a jolt one
day. Said Hannah: “Now, Mr. Speaker,
with regards to the Government”
“Couldn’t you say, ‘with kind regards to the
Government’?” pleaded Murray with simu-
lated seriousness. It was one of the bright-
est flashes Yawn ever had.
Occasionally Westr&lian Parliamentarians
can do business with very little talk. Re-
cently, while the Assembly was discussing
ways and means, a member moved that they
themselves should forfeit 10 p.c. of salaries
till times were financially better. The only
delay was in securing a seconder. After a
dismal silence of several minutes, someone
half-heartedly supported the idea, which was
rejected in three seconds by 26 votes to 9.
No hot-air wasted over a proposition like
that.
Ex-Salvationist Bruntnell, M.L.A., has
persuaded the Ma State Assembly to accept
his liquor-referendum motion. His proposal
is that the people should decide by a bare
majority re the absolute prohibition of “the
manufacture, importation and sale of alcohol
except for religious and medicinal purposes.”
In his haste or ignorance the ex-Salv’army
man quite forgot, or never knew, that alcohol
is used for multitudes of manufacturing and
scientific purposes—purposes that are neither
medicinal nor religious nor convivial, but if
his crude device becomes law he will doubt-
less learn these things at the public ex-
pense. Why he sticks to his “religious pur-
poses” so strenuously no one can tell. There
is absolutely no reason—unless habit is a
reason—that the Church should consume
every communion-day the strong waters
which redden the nose and steal away the
brain. Unfermented wine—the pure juice
of the grape—would serve as well, and there
would be fewer bottles on the road to Para-
dise. One thing is certain —the Church will
have to be put on a strict allowance when
the hotels and breweries are closed. Other-
wise someone will start a new sect with high
pew rents and frequent communion services
and a good square drink for each communi-
caut, and it will prosper accordingly. Also
well-endowed sects of dubious authenticity
may send in large requisitions for spirits,
and a scant congregation consisting of the
parson and a few other good poker-players
may hold revel on the proceeds. Whether
itinerant preachers and street-exliorters will
be allowed to carry their supply with them
is a side-issue. It will be a strange reversal
of the old order when only the religious
drink and all the unbelievers are dry.
“Manuamedd” : If Watt is so anxious to
raise money by taxation, why not a tax on
talking? Members of Parliament might be
taxed so much per minute after 20 minutes:
mayors and aldermen so much per minute
over 10 minutes. This is suggested in the
interest of returned Anzacs. Was at the
civic reception to Billjims at Ilandwick
(Sydney) Town Hall a few nights ago. The
boys in khaki had been inveigled there on the
understanding that they were to be enter-
tained. They were lined up at the back of
the platform, standing to attention while the
Mayor yapped for 35 minutes. When he had
run down a parson arose and meandered on
about some “home” or other that he was in-
terested in for a good 20 minutes. A captain-
chaplain, who has not been to the Front,
next let himself go in the long-winded efforts,
with the result that it was well after 10 o’clock
before the soldiers were allowed to dismiss
and share a little pleasure with those who had
assembled to see that they got it. Incidentally,
parsons of all denominations might be taxed
if they exceeded 10 minutes in the pulpit.
Heard the Very Itev. Canon Creswell
Strange—one of the finest extempore preach-
ers in Great Britain—once state that any
preacher who was worthy the name could
say all he wanted to in 10 minutes, and I
never knew him exceed the limit, even when
he preached by command before the late
Queen Victoria.
Amending Acts are the resource of the
patchwork legislator, like postscripts on a
letter or codicils on a will, but by the time
there are three codicils it is more tidy to
make a new will. If the N. S. Wales Stamp
Duties Bill had been passed, which it wasn’t,
it would have been necessary to consult five
Acts of Parliament to make quite sure how
to' give a receipt for £2, and five seem too
many.
THE DESPOT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Unless every soldier joins the league we cannot
deal with the despot running the Post Office.
(Applause.) I call him a despot, but that is only
a mild term. (Applause.)”— Report of speech at
soldiers’ demonstration.
Ho! Despots, tyrants of the giddy past,
Whose toppling grandeur overawed the earth!
Ho! Captains of swift words that round the mast
Made terror though the boss was in his berth !
Ho! Everyone that long ago insisted
On vengeance when an angry serf resisted,
We have a man at last to match with you
Who tells a whole Post Office what to do!
Mark it obey! Behold it gather string!
On manhood’s might it makes a fearful tax
When as the servitors the mailbags fling
It stoops and sweats to save the sealing-wax.
See where the languid victims wildly run
In swift desire to serve, with faces pale;
Eager to finish some high task begun,
Their maddened haste outstrips the racing snail.
See them sell stamps! TJjkc proper union rate,
As some declare, is really nine per hour;
But one, with some assistance from his mate.
Sold twenty-six by sheer resistless power.
Observe another. See the date-stamp fall!
It was not thus in any ancient days,
lie smites like one who batters down a wall
And all the office breaks in songs of praise.
Songs! Lo, the despot sings and all are mute.
The mailbags vanish, letters glide astray.
Thus Nero sang to his delightful lute
When Home was burning half a street away.
Let us be glad in spite of all our losses.
Here is the triumph of our boss of bosses
For while the music swells, what Wight dare seek
'The telegram that went astray last week ?

“Frank R.”: Crossed the range recently in
a blacks’ camp near Cooktown (N.Q.), Paddy Gor-
man, perhaps one of the best blacktrackers of his
day. Fifteen years ago I met Paddy at Normanton.
A little girl had wandered into the bush the previous
day, and Paddy was selected to follow her tracks.
Through the bush the footprints were easy to trace,
but eventually the search-party came to stony ground,
and several times Gorman halted the team whilst he
rode in circles until he picked up the tracks again.
On the morning of the third day Paddy pulled up in
front of a thick belt of scrub, and, turning to the
police-sergeant, said : “Little girl dead, body lying in
there”—pointing to the scrub. Fifteen minutes later
the party found the body. Gorman afterwards ex-
plained that he knew the child’s dead body was lying
in the bushes, as several hawks flew away on the
party’s approach. There were many people in the
Gulf who would have kept Paddy in food and tobacco
until the end of his days, but the tracker's desire for
drink, opium and camp-life made this impossible.
There has been many arguments as to the tracking
abilities of Gorman and the late Paddy Perkins. I
take off my hat to the former aboriginal.

“Barcoo” : The temperature—l9Sdeg.—of
Harry Hart’s Springfield 6000-odd feet bore on the
Barcoo River (C.Q.), quoted by “Noogoora” (B.
17/10/’18) is only a circumstance. The town bore at
Winton (W.Q.) registers 210 deg. Tea is made on
the instant at the bore-head. Salt-junk suspended
on a piece of bent fencing-wire underneath the over-
flow is cooked to a turn in 45 minutes. This is a
consideration in the centre of a huge plain 15
miles from the nearest fuel. Owing to the extreme
heat of the water the town supply is carried in mains
with specially-manufactured expansion and contrac-
tion joints. Practically the whole of the Central and
North-Western Bananaland towns’ water-supplies are
derived from artesian flows ; and once the bore-water
habit is acquired the inhabitant tilts the nose
at rain water. As a matter of fact, most townships
with artesian supplies have turned rain-water tanks
to other purposes. The great peculiarity of the
flowing wells is that the temperature of the fluid is
not. regulated by the depth of the hole, as some very
shallow wells are quite as torrid as the very deep
ones.
* * * *
“Lantana”: Just recently a resident of
East Kentpsey (N.S.W.) brickyards got a shock on
bailing up her cow, to find a big brown snake suck-
ing the animal's udder and holding on by a coil of
its body round .the cow’s hind-leg. The udder was
found to’have been sucked absolutely dry.
* * # *
“G.A.”: The frogmouth is my entry for
the Camouflage Stakes. Sitting motionless on a
rough gum-bough (a favorite position during the
day ), his color and attitude so will match a dead
branch snapped off short that he is practically un-
discernible to other than experienced eyes. It's a
quaint and inconspicuous party when dad, together
with the missus and kids, line along a branch, head
to tail, quite inert with eyes closed. Owing to the
softness of their plumage they make an almost
noiseless flight, and even when passing close to your
head you can’t hear a flutter. The froganouth is use-
ful as well as unique; being insectivorous, it polishes
off large quantities of night-flying insects. Mrs.
Frogmouth lays long white eggs, and she must be
a good equilibrist to balance these in her nest,
which is merely a few sticks placed anyhow in the
fork of a tree.
“The Wanderer”: Now and again a
whoop is made regarding some' big cedar-tree on the
N. S. Wales coast. In the early days cedar-cutters
made a pot of money out of this class of timber, and
it’s useless to try and work up any great enthusiasm
about present cedar belts the belt’s too narrow. In
the days when N. S. Wales was young, the late
C. L. Brown, of Dungog, used to sell cedar to con-
tractors at £1 per 1000 ft., payable on the spot. In
John Dunrnore Lang’s “History of N. S. Wales,” pub-
lished in 1875, he relates where he rode out with
01. l man Brown to one of the brushes on his estate to
see the process of cedar-cutting, and in par-
ticular to see a remarkable tree. It was
9ft. in diameter where it had been cut through
with a crosscut saw, and 29ft. in circumference at
the ground. It was perfectly sound throughout, and
was estimated to yield SO,oooft. of timber. At
Brown’s rate of charging then this giant accounted
for £3O. Cedar Party Creek, near Wingham, earned
its title because of its cedar belt in the young days
of Australia. Old Jim Northam, still in the flesh,
and within an ace of 100 years, made a elothes-box
out of cedar cut near Wingham in the days when
his beard hadn’t started to sprout. He has the box
to-day, as good as the hour he finished it, over half
a century ago.
FRIENDLY, LIKE.
PRESIDENT OF THE PASTORALIST AGRICUL-
TURIST ASSOCIATION: “Em glad to see
you’ve got over your differences with us,
Bill, and sent them pigs in this time.”
BILL: “Yus, Tom; I thought it 'ud look more

CONSERVATIVE.
RUSTY: “I wonder you haven't pone in for a motor, Regyie.”
REGGIE: “Well, if see, dear hoy. a fellah’s too fond of his horses.”
“Ciaran”: In our country hospital in
Bananaland we get some diversion in watching the
occupations of the peewees—little birds about the
size of a blackbird, very trim and dandified in their
neat uniform of black and white. They are not tame
in the ordinary sense ; they take little or no heed of
human beings, and neither fly away at one’s approach
nor gather round for scraps of food, as many other
birds do. The peewee is always busy and preoccupied,
like a child that plays by itself. When the little
chaps are not busy hunting insects for food, their
chief job seems to be policing the air. If a hawk
comes near the house, with a shrill “pee-weep” the
fearless little John Hops are after hint. They mob
birds much bigger than themselves—-crows, magpies,
hawks or kookaburras. Their spread of wing, unusual
for their size, gives them a turn of speed and a
quickness in hovering and turning which the stronger
birds cannot compete with. This last month or two
with a family to bring up the vigilance of our pair
has redoubled. Some jacks arrived the other day
and began to show an’ unwelcome interest in the
peewees’ domestic arrangements. The two little birds,
therefore, took turn about—one to sit on the nest, the
other to hustle the kookaburras. Even the oldest and
wisest-looking of the jacks could not long stand the
strain of having a small black and white sentinel
perched on a twig just above his head, and flapping
down to peck at him whenever he stirred. Our dignified
black cat went out one day scouting quietly along the
garden fence; but the sharp-sighted little watchers
marked him down, and puss came back skeltering
down the path pursued by two angry flapping little
birds using scandalous language.
“Ragar” : Went down for close up to the
count last year to malaria. Was dosed with cascara
and then kept on slops for a spell, after which I was
on arsenic and iron for a week. Then came the
quinine. For three weeks I was on 20 grains of
quinine bihydrochloride every night. Then a spell for
a fortnight, followed by three weeks of iron-and-
arsenic tonic. It knocked the fever out of me, and
I haven’t had a touch of it since, but my ears
haven’t stopped ringing with the quinine effect yet. A
week on an iron-and-arsenic tonic about every three
months keeps the blood in good condition and ren-
ders one less liable to go down to the malaria germ.
Quinine, unless taken every day for at least three
weeks, is of very little use, and is a poison with
rather unpleasant effects to some people.

“W.” : The schoolmaster needs caning now
and then. Lately the ped. in our hamlet told the
children that waratahs grow only on the Blue Moun-
tains (N.S.W.). When one child said he had seen
them near Sydney, old Blackboard disbelieved him.
Yet thousands gather waratahs in the season on the
sandstone country between Hornsby and Qalston, also
Christmas bush and Christmas bells. By the way, the

where 1 ever saw fianriel-flowers growing was on what

UP-CREEK.
[Fon The Bulletin.]
At sunset rowing,
The slow tide flowing
O’er ways sand-bedded.
Up-creek we headed
With hearts at egst,
While evermore
On each red shore
Grey magpies called from the blood wood-trees.
The she-oaks weeping’,
The waters creeping
Through mangroves lining
The banks, and shining
In day’s last glow,
Wrought such a spell
As those who dwell
In sweet, green places alone may know.
How tame the pleasure
And lame the leisure
Of gardens ordered
And waysides bordered
With walls, rose-crowned,
Beside the rife,
Rich joy of life
That flowed, full-volumed, from all around !
From verdant valley
And frouded alley,
And hilltop gleaming
From blooms unknown;
A silver shawl —
A waterfall—
Across the breast of a cliff was thrown.
By slopes green-crested
At times we rested—
Two musing mortals
At wonder’s portals—
Upon our oars,
While, soft and sweet
And all too fleet.
The roselights died on the wooded shores.
• With gleam and glimmer
Grown grey and dimmer
The waters, studded
With mangroves, flooded
The white sand-flats;
And to and fro,
Now high, now low',
Wood-swallows hunted the flies and gnats.
As though enchanted,
The green hills slanted
The waters under,
And made a wonder
Of reach and cove.
’Twixt sky and sky
We drifted by—
’Twixt skies down under and skies above.
The twilight spreading
Its veil, and treading
The sylvan places,
With mystic graces,
Made sweet our way;
The rich hues died
Upon the tide —
The rose to gold, and the gold to grey.
A swan home sailing,
A curlew wailing,
A crane slow flapping,
The rocks, and then
Such peace at hand
On cove and land
As men find not in the haunts of men !
At twilight rowing,
The still tide flowing
O’er ways sand-bedded,
Up-creek we headed;
For night was nigh,
And, clear and high,
Grey magpies called from the trees no more.

“Pick”: The mountain trout or minnow,
an elegant salmon-shaped little chap, four inches
long, that inhabits the snow-cold streams from Kos-
ciusko, has the protective power of changing- color
with Hie seasons. In the winter of those shadowed
gorges he wears a coat, of slate-grey mottled with
darker blotches. In this costume it is almost im-
possible to distinguish his form against the shaded
stones and the mudbatiks under which he lurks.
But when the summer sun glints through the foli-
age his scales become margined with gold, and his
tins deepen to orange or even fed, In his new
uniform the dandy sports in the shallows, and
matches the wild hop and wattle flowers on the
banks.
“Bung”: A goods-train, after ploughing
through a thunderstorm down Goulburn (N.S.W.) way
the other evening, pulled in and shunted off a half-
laden truck at Bnngetidore. The tarpaulin covering
the truck had bellied downwards under the deluge,
and the concavity held about half a tank of rain-
water. Next morning it was discovered that this
miniature lake contained numbers of tadpoles an
inch long'. At this size the embryo frog is at least
four weeks old, and it didn't take the train that
long to come from Goulburn. Perhaps some Abo. will
rise and tell us how th t > tadpoles got there.

“Ida D.” : “Geo. 7/11/’lB)gsks me
what is a towri. A towri is the ground hunted and
fished over by a tribe, and has usually well-defined
boundaries. In the old days trespass on a towri was
severely punished by the offended tribe; but at a
place in Queensland near the Blackfill Banges several
tribes annually met on common ground. At the season
of the year when the bunya-fruit was ripe, blacks
from the interior and from nearer the coast met,
“swapping” their wares, and their sisters and holding
corroborees. The outback tribes brought their nullahs
and womerahs, and in exchange ggt shells and fish.
During one of the big dry spells one tribe, whose
towri embraced a large waterhole, rich in waterfowl
and mussels, announced that this favored spot was
free to all. _ The starving neighbors gathered here,
and lived in comparative plenty till the rains allowed
them to return to their own towris. An earlier par
of mine reads that bri has “something to do with
water,” which I think “Geo. D.” will admit suffici-
ently covers the ground.

“Trooper Wombat”: Along the Jordan
Valley are a huge fighting spider and a species
of scorpion that is not slow in a scrap.
These furies provided the boys with a fair measure
of sport when “Jacko” was not too busy. Every
troop had its crack spider or scorpion, and often-
times much hard-earned lucre changed hands over the
contests, which were always to a finish. The com-
batants were placed in a biscuit-tin, which served as
the ring, and neither lost time in getting to business,
the scorp. with its two sets of claws, like a crab,
and sting-equipped tail, and the spider with his
pointed, vyce-like jaws, which five times in six were
too much for the scorp. Bill and I were partners in
a champion spider. Be was a Jack Johnson
of his kind, and we won 12 fights with him. There
was not a spider or a scorpion in the Valley could
beat him : but he met his Waterloo in a go with a
centipede, lie killed the ’pede, but did not survive
long enough to attend the funeral.

“P. : 1 lull no if “11.Y.E.” hits been sulli-
ciently observant when out snaking. He (B.
21/11/’IS) expresses a doubt that the bunda-bunda is
a Monaro (N.S.W.) trawler. On Sherwin’s Range,
north of the Maelaughlan, I have seen many of the
family ringed with black and grey bands, which the
busluonn there call “bandie3.” They don't seen: to
grow longer than about 2ft. or 21ft., but they are
the liveliest thing 1 know of. Also “11.V.E.” speaks
<>! the brown snake as very rare on the ef*«st below
Monaro's eastern slope. If he will take the trouble
to explore the Merriwinga and Warranting swamps,
north of Begs, lie will find there that brownie lias a
majority where blacks and tigers assemble in
legions, and if lie wants further variety the slate-
colored swamp snake and the hideously vicious
broadhead will also now and I lieu challenge the right
of way among the bulrushes.
“Melos”: A dainty litdlo fellow is the
blood-bird, one of the smallest of the honey-eaters.
The male is remarkably beautiful in a suit of bril-
liant starlet relieved with glossy black on the
tail and wings and buff on the belly-band. The
female's upper garments are light brown, and her
undies are somewhat, lighter. Her nest is a frail
structure of woven bark fibre, not much bigger
than a florin —probably the smallest cradle in our
bush —but quite in keeping with the proportions
of the family. Another interesting characteristic
of this species is the animated song, exquisite in
its sweetness.
NO NEED TO WORRY.
ANDY: “Is it true you’ve got an acetylene-gas plant put up?"
MARTIN: “Yus!"
ANDY: “But ain’t it dangerous?"
MARTIN : “Dam’fino; the missus looks after it."

TEACHER : “Note, children. I wont non to make a srawing of what you ivould like to

LITTLE GIRL: “Please, I want to he married, hut I don’t know how to draw it.”
“Myall”: Foxes are easily poisoned. Any
old bait flavored with a little strychnine will get
them, but the dingo will trot over a dozen care-
fully-prepared dishes, and selecting the best mutton,
will do his own butchering. Even the maternal
instinct, strongly developed as it is, is not always
sufficient to lure a dingo bitch into danger.
My mate Bill proved this beyond all doubt. During
last winter he was trapping on the Baloone (Q.).
Following a dog track through a thick patch of
scrub, he found it led to a big hollow log, in which
he discovered seven dingo puppies; but Mrs. Dingo
was not at home. With the skill born of long
experience at the game Bill set a trap at each
entrance to the log, and awaited developments.
Next morning he was surprised to find both traps
still unsprung. The fresh tracks proved that the
bitch had returned, but had not attempted to enter
the log', where her family was hidden, instinctively
knowing the lurking danger that threatened. Next
morning same result. On the third morning there
were no fresh tracks visible and there was no other
solution of the problem than that the old faggot
had changed her address and left her family to
perish. Bill saw to it that she wasn’t disappointed.

“D.”: Kelton was a bachelor of 36. lie
owned close upon 400 acres of good land, the big
timber of which, after being a bane and a problem
for 10 years, was now a valuable asset, thanks to
Quill's mill at Flatfoot. Billy Kelton had not shown
himself an energetic mover up to now, consequently
we of the immediate neighborhood were astonished
at curious manosuvres on the far hillside, visible over
a large stretch of valley. What it all looked like to
us was a man running vigorously up a tall pole,
standing erect, going over the top, and coming down
the other side with equal velocity. When this had hap-
pened six times in the course of two days the native
curiosity of a reasonable people induced a drift in
the direction of Kelton’s possessions. Corbet was
already investigating when I arrived, and Kelton had
just completed his peculiar manoeuvre. The object
erect in the air was a new 40ft. ladder. Several feet
of it were sunken in the ground, it was securely
braced with wire ropes, and Kelton’s scheme was to
chase himself up the rungs at his best pace, swarm
over, and rattle down again. “What’s i-t all mean?”
asked Corbet. “Trainin’,” said Kelton. “What yer
goin’ in fer —foot-races upstairs, or the runnin’ high
climb?” “I’m goin’ to get married.” Corbet thought
it over seriously. “Well,” he said, “I bin a bit
married in my time, but I never done no trainin’ for
it.” “P’raps not,” Kelton replied; “but look who
I’m marryin’—Amy Debbs ! ’•’ Corbet sat down. I
was a bit staggered myself. Amy Debbs was notori-
ous in three districts as a most violent-tempered and
pugilistic shrew. Flatfoot caller her “The Boxing
Kangaroo,” a. tribute to her fighting qualities and her
weird physical attributes. Popular opinion had it
that she had chased the late “Gentleman” Debbs into
his grave with an adze-handle, her favorite resort in
argument. “With her land ’n’ mine, I reckon a man
might start a mill iv his own here,” said Kelton,
mentioning an extenuating circumstance. “But this
here ground n lofty business?’’ Corbet indicated the
ladder. Kelt on grinned. “That's just a get-away,”
he said. “If she comes at me I shine up the ladder,
’n' play with, the birds till Amy cools off.” “It
works all right,” said Corbet heavily, “till her lady-
ship takes an axe to the ladder.” This argument
appealed to Kclton, and when I next saw him he had
his ladder secured against a tall, otherwise inaccessi-
ble white gum. I am credibly informed that for a
whole week after his marriage Ivelton had no need to
run for his ladder at all, and then on three occasions
in as many days he fled to the heights from the
virulent anger of his bride. At the end of the fort-
night Corbet looked me up with news. “Heard iv
Kelton?” he said. “He’s in ’orspittle. Was took
yesterdee evenin’. It seems he went fer his ladder
ez usual, Amy after him helter-skelter with ’er adze-
andle. Billy jumped fer the ladder, ’n’ come a
fearful box of chops, ’n’ the missus got at him afore
he recovered the shock. Th e fall broke two of his
ribs—she done the rest. You see, her ladyship had
gone secret, ’n’ cut the first eight rungs within a
shavin’ iv clean through.” I saw Billy Kelton when
he came out of hospital. He had a gentle air that
covered a certain strange, cold conviction. “I’m
goin’ home to mend the ladder,” he said. “You might
keep an eye on it, mister, durin’ the nex’ few
days.” It was Corbet, however, who drew my atten-
tion to the latest development. “There’s Billy up
his ladder again,” he called. I went forth with my
glasses. Certainly there was a figure perched on the
lowermost limb of the huge white gum. I looked
more closely. It was Amy!

Dugout’ : Saw a record bit of fishing the
other day. Four boys were seated on the embank-
ment of a dam fishing for crayfish, each lad pro-
vided with a stick about three feet long and a line
about the same length. Raw bunny flesh was used as
bait, a lump about an inch square being lowered on
the end of the line into the water. When a cray
had fastened to the meat and was relishing the
flavor was jerked out of the water. Result of
one hour’s fishing: 500 crayfish; average per boy,
120. Binghi is credited with being an expert cray
gatherer, but this performance knocks him as far as
my experience goes.

“John Quill”: When burying their dead
the A\ estralian blacks generally lowered the corpse
with a supply of provisions into a pit, and covered
it over with sticks and bushes. On the edge of
the hole they placed a finger-post with a cross-stick
indicating the direction in which the tribe was
going. The idea was that the spirit after a rest
would arise and hasten to rejoin the tribe in its
wanderings.
THE CONTEMPTIBLE KERR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Returning to his farm, John Drew
Of domesticity no sound
Could hear. The stable door swung wide,
The chestnut mare was not inside,
Nor was the jinker to be found;
But when he looked the house around
Pinned to the table, John descried
A note from Mrs. D. to say
With Andrew Kerr she'd run away.
Three miles, to Henry Leigh's, sped Drew,
With homicidal feelings filled,
A horse to borrow, so that lie
Might give pursuit. “Wliat’s up ?” asked Leigh.
Drew’s voice to bitter anger shrilled:
“Tl.at Kerr, the cow, he should be killed !
The blanker’g gone and pinched from me
Me mare and jinker, and a set
Of harness—but I'll catch him-yet!”
VICTOIUA.

The Inky Way
Albert Mullett, Tie. Government Printer,
seems to be an unusual kind of btate official.
He has lately been visiting the U.S., to see
about getting a direct Supply of paper foi
liis Government, and has advised freasuiei
McPherson that the State can save £15,0U0
on its next contracts if it likes to buy over-
seas, besides getting better goods for the
money spent. Victoria can afford a good
deal in travelling expenses to effect a saving
of that size; but Mullett is actually trying
to do something to the expense-bill as well.
The Cabinet gave him authority to extend
his trip to England, if he thought it advis-
able; and he decided to come hack to A as-
tralia instead. Now, any politician would
know better than that.
“Copy Boy”; Does poetry pay? Con-
sider Dennis's sales to date: “Sentimental.
Bloke,” S2,(MK>; “Ginger Mick, ’ 52,000 ;
“Glugs of Gosh.” 23,900 ;• “Doreen,” 55,000.
An English edition of “The Glugs” has just,
been published, and was sold out within a.
fortnight, while (>OOO copies of the revised
edition of “Backblocks Ballads,’ issued a
few months ago, have already been sold.
Also, the moving-picture rights of the
“Bloke” brought “Den” four figures.
“Glen lluntly”: There is something-
pathetic in the way the men at the other-
end of the press cables every now and then
send out a few lines of mediocre verse by
Poet-Laureate Robert Bridges. A few
weeks back we were solemnly informed that.
Bridges had written a poem telling the Ilun
that he was a bad egg, but retribution,
would surely overtake him. Probably died
poets in various parts of the British Ltnpii e
in the last four years have warned the llun
that Nemesis would arrive, but when the
painfully obvious idea was adopted by
Bridges it at once assumed the rank and
dignity of a Great Thought. The glad
tidings are now sent that Robert, has written
a poem commemorating the Allies’ victory,
in which he mentions: —
The sportive sons
From thy vast Dominions,
Stern in onset or defence.
Terrible in their confidence.
I’m sure it. is very nice of Robert to say so,
but was it worth while to forward the remark
thousands of miles by cable? Similar
pathetic reverence for another British insti-
tution moved one of the cable associations,
to chronicle the fact, when the first batch
of Australian troops arrived m England,,
that London Paunch published a cartoon
in which a lion was shown shaking paws
with a kangaroo, or something equally origi-
nal.
“Fellow”; At the annual conference of the
Institute of Journalists at Leeds (England)
it was decided to suggest to the I rime Mini-
ster that, following the example of the Gov-
ernments of Italy, France and the United
States, the British Government ought to
select its consuls, ambassadors and important
department officials from the ranks of jour-
nalists. Another resolution ran : Consider-
ing that dockers, shipwrights, engineers,
etc have special and direct representation m
the’ House of Commons, that this conference
is of the opinion that journalists —politics
being an essential part of their profession-
should be directly represented in Parliament,
as Unionists or as Liberals ; and that it be a
recommendation that 12 seats should be con-
tested by journalists at the general election ;
three in Ireland, three in Scotland, and six
in England.” As Australia ought to be repre-
sented abroad by respectable, intelligent Aus-
tralians capable of watching Australian poli-
tical and business interests, I beg to move
that the Australian Journalists’ Association
takes up the first of these resolutions for a
start.
“Rita S.” : Of all the daily prints wrest-
ling with the paper-shortage problem, let it
be said to its credit that the Bendigo Adver-
tiser, which has just changed hands, ga\ e
the minor poets of Bendigo a chance to blow
oil steam. Fred Morris (Eaglehawk’s pious
Clerk of Courts, and a good fellow) could
always rely on getting a few verses
into the columns of the Mackay Brothers
very conservative paper. Another rhymester,
Marion Tranter, trilled a little now and
then, and there were others coming on. The
’Tiser singers had to be exceedingly prim
and proper, and no dryad was admitted
unless she had a blouse and skirt. A hymn
even if it was a passable parody on a well-
known sacred melody—r-was certain of accept-
ance.
Bernard Shaw, who relinquished active
journalism 2(3 years ago, when lie handed
over his job as dramatic critic of the
Saturday Review to the sprightly Max
Beerbohm, has got back into harness as
musical critic of the Nation. Shaw was
merrily flaying musicians long before he
formed himself into a Society for the Inflic-
tion of Cruelty on Actors. He started on the
Star, and his articles, signed “Corno di
Bassetto” were, as he himself admits, “devil-
ish amusing.” Later he succeeded Louis
Engel on the World. Lack of royalties has
probably driven him back to the inky way,
for since the publication of “Commonsense
About the War” London managers have
mostly fought shy of his plays, and he has
also missed the royalties which he used to
obtain from Germany, where before hostili-
ties he enjoyed considerable vogue as a
dramatist-
“Bill Bowyang”: I’ve walked into some
.queer printing offices since I went forth to
biff Abdul in 1914, but I struck the limit
when I visited the only jobbing office in
Jerusalem. Prior to our entry into the Holy
■City this plant had been working at high
pressure turning out propaganda pamphlets
which were circulated amongst the Arabs to
impress them that the Hun was their friend
for life. The office contained an immense
amount of German, Turkish, Arabic and
Hebrew type, but English fonts were miss-
ing. Most of the machinery had been made
in Italy. When I last visited the office the
Jewish' proprietor was busily engaged in
digging up the back yard in hopes of finding
the English type which he planted when war
was declared.
Business, Robbery, etc.
If the Inter-State Commission, now in-
quiring into the alleged high cost of house
rents, want to know the real cause of
some of the evidence pumped into them
by interested witnesses tffey might go
to Box Hill (Vic.) and see timber-jinkers,
loaded with doors, windows, soft woods and
even hardwoods which have recently been
railed down to Melbourne from the hill
country beyond, going back again to the
country where villas and mansions are ever
going up. Those same jinkers return at
night, each with a few cases of galvanised-
iron aboard, plain and corrugated. The
Commission and the price-fixing authorities
have long ago been told that iron is prac-
tically unobtainable in Melbourne. I sup-
pose * there must be some large ironworks
concealed in those gullies arid ranges. I
know men building little homes who cannot
get tiles to put on the roofs, though they
have had their orders,on the companies’ lists
for six months; but if you happen to be a
large man building a large house there’s no
trouble at all. * „ *
“Wandi” : The manufacture of paper from
blady-grass, which is said to have proved a
success at Cairns (Q.), should mark a long
step forward in the paper industry if pur-
sued. It would save the pulping of wood,
which at the best is a waste of material that
takes many years to grow, and that
is becoming scarcer and dearer in the world s
markets every year. On the other hand,
blady-grass is one of the natural resources
that will never die out. It is a luxuriant
cropper, growing four feet high and very
dense, and at least two crops a year can be
cut off the same ground. Other tall native
grasses, which give the wide open plains the
appearance of wheat fields, would doubtless
be equally satisfactory. Blady-grass, how-
ever, which could easily be propagated where
required, would ensure an inexhaustible sup-
ply of raw material. There are large areas
of this vegetable on the north-eastern rivers
of N. S. Wales, which is burnt off annually.
It is also burnt off in summer in Queens-
land. To convert this abundant material
into paper instead of burning it would mean
good business for Australia.
“Obu”: Despite the production of
67,8311 b. of twist tobacco during 1917, the
British New Guinea Development Co. is
unable to make this branch of industry pay
its way.’ The preferential tariff granted on
the weed manufactured in Papua, while
assisting the industry, has been more than
set off by the increased excise duty on the
ingredients used in production. Consequently
the co.’s island manager reports that he is
unable to manufacture tobacco at as low a rate
as the f.o.b. Sydney cost of the Yankee article.
There was a loss of £2212 on the year, so the
co. has decided for the present to discon-
tinue what ought to be a prosperous industry
in New Guinea.
* * * *
In 1814 Governor Macquarie employed
John Hutchison to have a look at some
of our great natural resources. John re-
ported, siruongst other things, that blue-gum
bark, suitably treated, made a splendid black
printers’ ink. H e also claimed that a plant
which he calls the “N.S.W. Justic,” yielded
an extract as goad for dyeing and printing as
the sumach and galls then used for those
jobs.
* * * *
Nature intended s; o uth Aus. to be
the bacchanalian State 0 f the Common-
wealth. As an indication »f what the grape
means to it, the following figu-e s are interest-
ing. For the 1912-13 season 21,353 acres
were planted with vines of bearingageand 3853
with vines not yet bearing. Thegrap, yield was
42,605 tons, from which 3,971,838 feillons of
wine were produced, with an estimate! value
of £544,232. The same year 401,414 gu'ions
of wine were exported overseas and 550,*00
to other States. The. cultivation of tabe
grapes, currants and raisins is also proht
able, and for currants alone (tliis vine thrives
particularly well in S.A.) experts consider
12,000 acres can safely be placed under Zante
currants without congesting local markets.
* * * *
“Jacko” : As a striking illustration of the
way in which the N. S. Wales Railway
Department discourages new local industries
I’ll nominate the absence of facilities at the
recently-born and rapidly-growing township
of Kandos, where the N. S. Wales Cement
Lime and Coal Co., Ltd., has invested
£300,000, with more to come. The un-
attended siding that existed when there
were two men and a dog in the district still
serves, despite the fact that the traffic in-
ward and outward exceeds in a day that ot
any half a dozen neighboring full-blown
stations in a week. The place now has a
population of over 1200, with a heavy pas-
senger business. Richards, the superinten-
dent of the big co., complains that up to
£2OO a month has been lost by his concern
in vanished goods from the railway sidings.
To get the point home with Chief Commis-
sioner Fraser he recently photographed the
industrial scenery and slices of the booming
settlement lit has a pub that cost ±13,000
and stands second to none in improvements
to any in the country), and got them up
book fashion for the C.C., leaving the last
page blank for what ought to have been the
railway station.

“G.”: Re the profit in the grunter, and
the possibilities in turning damaged wheat
into bacon, referred to in The Bulletin
some weeks ago. James Wilson, at a recent
dairymen's conference in Launceston, put it
this way:—
To show what can be done with a good sow within
12 months I will give an illustration of what I am
doing with a voung sow this year. On February 2;>
she littered 13 and reared 12. Of these two were
sold for breeding for £9 95., and 10 were sold for
bacon, averaging £3 10s. each; a total of £44 9s.
Now the sow has 12 at foot just littered, 'these,
if nothing unforeseen happens, will he in the factory
for bacon about the beginning of February next, and
should bring not less than £3 10s. each
A total amount of £B6 9s. from one lady pig
for 12 months is a fair return for her board
and lodging and a few kindly words between
meals

They are cheaper—by
not less than 30 per cent,
—than imported licks.
ARMERS! When Buying, do you select poor-conditioned sheep or cattle? When
selling, do your low-conditioned stock get the best prices?
In the production of better milk, high-test cream, better wool, solid flesh, etc., good
health is the first essential.
Animals respond to better conditions, liKe tbe Human.
The full meaning of this is that your stock must have a rating of Salt Lick. All over the
farming world salt licks have won their position as an indispensable commodity on the farm.
To-day no fewer than 700,000 cases of salt licks are being used in Australia.
Do you use Salt LicKs to your Animals?
If not demand a case of
BONDO Salt Licks
at your storekeeper’s. Watch how the cattle relish the rating and see the change in their condition.

“0.K.” : Few people know how much the
popularity of Dickens owes to the stage.
There have been at least 170 dramatisations
of Dickens novels, and though they were
mostly failures or semi-failures a great
many have become standard attractions in
Britain and America. At one time or other
some remarkably fine acting has been put
into the Dickens performances. There are
great Hugh Cartons known to the present
generation, and the names of several famous
bygone character-actors are associated with
the novelist. My early recollections of the
Dickens performance that impressed me most
was “Nicholas Nickleby,” with a specially
chosen cast. John Clark and Mrs. Alfred
Mellon as Mr. and Mrs. Squeers; Lydia
Foote as Smike; Sam Emery as John
Brodie; Fernandez as Ralph Nickleby; and
Terriss as Nicholas Nickleby. Of that lot
Sam Emery was really famous in his day for
his Peggotty in the versions of “Copper-
field.” Whilst Clarke (somewhat lamed by

am not the actor I was.”
ACTOR FRIEND: “Congratulations, old boy,
congratulations.”
a fall in the hunting-field) was the recog-
nised Quilp in London. The old generation
of Australian playgoers swear by Fred Mar-
shall as Quilp, but Marshall was rather
before my time out here. In fact, I don’t
remember any performance of a Dickens play
in Australia in 30 years, except “The Only
Way,” with Tyrone Power as Hugh Carton
and Rose Musgrove in the interpolated
character of Mimi, and as for the many
Dickens characterisations in costume that I
have seen on the variety stage or lecture plat-
form, I reckon that Alexander Watson, in
plain evening-dress, was the most forcible
actor of them all. Watson, of course, has
done a lot to keep the memory of Dickens
green; and before him there was a long
succession of monologuists, stretching back
beyond the original George Grossmith and
the father of Bland Holt.
A Sydney committee has been formed for
the raising of a fund to promote the musical
studies of Miss Gertie Purcell, a mezzo-
soprano, now under the tuition of .Signor
D’Alba, on whose recommendation the young
singer will proceed to Italy to continue her
studies.
From London: —
We’re reminiscing about old-time ventriloquists
and monologue entertainers at this end, and by
general vote the late Fred McCabe is recalled as
probably the best. His Australian tour and lengthy
season at St. George’s Hall, Melbourne, are still
remembered with particular pleasure and satisfac-
tion. He was born in Liverpool of Irish parents
and started there as an auctioneer’s clerk. But
he soon discovered his ventriloquial powers and
remarkable capacity for rapid changes of character
and costume. His tours all over the British Isles,
and prolonged visits to America and Australia were
everywhere phenomenal successes. He called his
entertainment “Begone, Dull Care,” and it fully
realised its title. He and Henry Irving were great
chums. McCabe’s closing years were clouded with
financial misfortunes. He lost heavily in unfortu-
nate speculations, and was reduced to poverty. There
was widespread astonishment at the revelation that
he was the inmate of a charitable asylum. A great
benefit performance in Liverpool, supplemented with
a pension from the Actors’ Benevolent Fund bright-
ened things. The relief came late —as usual.
“L.H.P.”: The revival of Suppe’s comic
opera, “Boccaccio,” by Sydney and Mel-
bourne amateurs reminds one that John
Wallace, the stage-manager of the Mosman
(Sydney) show, was in the original Austra-
lian cast by A. T. Dunning’s London Comic
Opera Co. at Melbourne Opera House in
September of 1882. Wallace produced and
played Lotteringhi, the cooper, with Annette
Ivanova (Fiametta). Kate Chard (Boccac-
cio), Knight Aston (Leonetto), Dean Brand
(Scalza), Along Loredan (Pietro) and a
fine English Comedian, T. B. Appleby* as
Lambertuccio. Appleby was very versatile.
Later he made Australians weep with the
pathos of his Rip Van Winkle in the third
act of Planquette’s opera. Martin Simonsen,
who never worried about copyrights, pro-
duced the opera two months later at Dunedin
with lus wife, Fanny Simonsen, as Boccaccio,
and Madame Ricardi (Leonetto), Riccardi
(Scalza), Leonora Simonsen (Fiametta),
Frances Saville (Isabella), Brennir (Pie-
tro) and R. Fitzgerald and Fred Wentworth
in the comedy parts. The opera proved
Simonsen’s trump-card through Maoriland.
“Hawk”: The news that the
latest and most promising Aus-
tralian film production has been
sent back from the U.S.A. for re-
pairs, sole-and-heeling and gen-
eral renovation is only another
proof, if it were needed, of the
misdirection of local energy and
capital in this matter. To make
an acting version of an up-to-date
film scenario requires the con-
structive skill of an expert drama-
tist and something more. Motion-
acting is a special art in itself;
and the producing so differs from
that of the stage that every old
actor attempting it regularly
meets his Waterloo. Australia has
several advantages, including an
unsurpassed light for outdoor
scenes. Some of the differences
in film acting compared to the
theatre: The film play takes place
in a triangle, not a square, so
entrances and exits must take
place at or near the back; the
usual speed of the negative film
does not record very quick move-
ments. As the camera has only
one eye every group near it has to
bear that in mind, or one will
hide the other; for a like photo-
graphic reason, a face may not be
turned so far away from the spec-
tator as on the stage. And as the
picture should clearly tell the whole story,
the actors must act with a minuteness and
detail of pantomime rarely asked for on the
stage.
“75”: A Poverty Point paragraphist
(28/11/’18) mentions that while on his last
visit to the U.S. baritone Wallace Brown-
low read his own obituary notices. This is
so, but it was not “Wallajce Brownlow,” but
“Bill Tracey” who was "the subject of the
post-mortem eulogies. This was the name
assumed by Brownlow when mining in
Nevada. Strolling into Nevada City one
week-end he saw bills announcing the arri-
val of The American Musical Co., “Maude
Beatty, prima donna.” In his mining “clob-
ber,” and with whiskers that could have
done duty as a chest protector, he called at
the theatre to renew acquaintance with
Maude, who dared him to go on the stage
and sing just as he was. Wallace promptly
did so, and the audience, which was ready
to present him with the “bird,” finished by
demanding an encore. Next day the papers
came out with large headlines announcing
the discovery of a prospector with a beauti-
ful voice, and numerous journalists rushed
Wallace for the story of his life. He sup-
lied it more or less, but preserved his incog-
nito. It was some time later, when he was
down with fever in Santiago, that a San
Jose journal announced the demise of “Bill
Tracey,” but even then William’s real iden-
tity was not discovered.
“Parisine”: Exit Rostand. His “Cyrano
de Bergerac” elevated him to the line of
Corneille, Racine and Moliere. As litera-
ture this one play is above Hugo, though far
inferior to him in dramatic force. As for
the comparative stage-carpenter, Sardou, he
is not to be mentioned with Rostand. Sar-
dou was the dove-tailer of stage effect, which
Rostand never thought about. Yet Cor-
quelin enchanted Paris with Cyrano, and
egged Rostand on to his strange, unique
accomplishment of the bird play, “Chan-
ticleer.” Coquelin did not live long for that
and Guitry was never at home in it. Bern-
hardt, for an overflowing treasury, played
second fiddle to Coquelin as Roxane, in
Cyrano. Then Coquelin was second as
Flambeau, in “L’Aiglon”—good but not up
to Cyrano, and only written around Bern-
hardt, as Sardou wrote Fedora.
Professor Ennis has resigned the chair of
Music at Adelaide University, which he has

Died recently, in Auckland (M.L.),
George Stephenson, manager for Fuller’s
show in that town. A well-known
figure in Australia and Maoriland, he came
into prominence as auctioneer for his
father’s firm, Wright, Stephenson and Co. ;
in Dunedin. He was a clever amateur
theatrical entertainer, and he was also a
good footballer. lie represented Otago on
many a field. He gave Australia the
American Stine-Evans Co., in “Brown’s In
Town.” “Mamma’s New Husband,” etc.; and
the Edward Lauri-May Beatty Co. in
“Rose of the Riviera,” “Skirt Dancer,” etc-.,
in 1904-5-6.
“E.S.S.”: In a recent Bulletin “Orb”
says that he has never known the Aus-
tralian stage to be made a target for veg-
etables. Well, in my suburb there is a
simple chap known as “Peter the Painter,”
who has a delusion that he is a vocal mar-
vel going to waste. Some of the wags got
him into the vaudeville one night at Clay’s
Theatre, Sydney. I think there was * a
competition to discover talent in the neigh-
borhood, there being several of Peter’s
calibre who claimed to be top of the song
class. All Peter’s acquaintances rolled up
for the occasion, and when his song was
ended there came a hail of cabbages that
pretty well covered the stage. Peter
accepted them as compliments. He dodged
and ducked and bowed and smiled, then
gratefully gathered up the produce. Other
aspirants were bombarded the same night;
but, telling about it afterwards, Peter said
proudly that he got more cabbages than all
the rest put together.
“Silas”: A recent “P.P.” scribe protests
that he has never seen an actor smitten by
an egg, and concludes that the assertion that
actors are ever hit with eggs is poetical
perjury. True, an admirable custom is
falling into disuse, but time was in Aus-
tralia when the decrepit egg was a popular
method of expressing contempt for bad act-
ing, especially in the provinces. In one
small mining centre in Victoria I saw an
Ingomar driven off the stage by a fusillade

It ,” at Sydney Tivoli.

of eggs. It was the
second night of the
season, and appar-
ently the avengers
had had the eggs
laid expressly—
they were a» bad
as the-acting. To
this day an egg is
liable to happen to
any actor in the
course of a coun-
try tour. I saw a
bright fight in a
hotel-yard at Wal-
halla (when the
Long Tunnel was
still a veritable
gold-mine) between
a hefty young ac-
tor and an onion
farmer who had
thrown eggs at liim
the night before:
but in this case the
ingenuous agricul-
turist had meant
well—someone had
kidded him that an
egg was a compli-
ment always wel-
comed by an actor.
The “P. Pointer” in
question might have
known it was useless asking actors how
often they had been presented with eggs in
flight. They all deny the soft impeachment.
“Shanghai,” the large and costly musical
show lately produced at Drury Lane, con-
tains more items of Australian interest than
the appearance of Dot Brunton. Ivy Shil-
ling had a dance turn (which wasn’t too
favorably noticed, by the way), and Howard
Carr was credited with the prettiest of the
musical numbers, while Oscar Asche was re-
sponsible for the words of one of the songs.
The prosecution of a young English pro-
fessional beggar (with a solid banking
account) brought to light the fact that one
of the most payable ailments in the business
is St. Vitus’s dance. By merely carrying on
his chest the announcement that he suffered
from the occasional ragtime of St. Vitus, this
astute tactician could earn £lO a week on
his ear. From time to time he was com-
mitted to gaol, but during those retire-
ments from the profession the country kept
him, and his private household expenses were
suspended.

In lighter stuff, to be exact—
Save one, and lie has acted much
In noble, tragic roles.
He turns at length, and gibes at such
Misguided modern souls.

His liver even acts but ill!”

VOCALION
“The Xmas Gift for the Whole Family.”
JUST imagine the “Oh’s!” and “Ah’s! ” of the youngsters
and the admiration of the elders when on Christmas
morning the Vocalion —your gift —is found near the
Christmas tree. As some fine, lilting melody pours forth
from this distinguished-looking instrument and you see the
pleasure the beautiful music gives, you feel glad indeed that
you did get the one gift which all can enjoy.
And then what a satisfaction it is to know that, in the
Vocalion, you have given a unique gift- a greater phonograph.
For instance, the Graduola device —which no other instrument
possesses—enables you, if you wish, to vary the tone of your
records so that you may play as well as listen.

The Wheat Prospect.
“S.M.”: There isn’t any—not at least in
N.S.W. —save in exceptional places and under
exceptional conditions. So far there has been
a tendency to dodge the agricultural wage
question oil the ground that everything is m
a condition of flux during war-time, but
awards are inevitable. It is expected that
the wage will be doubled if calculated on
piecework rates —that is to say, the amount
of pav will go up and the hours will come
down to eight per day. The very humble
“355. and keep” for indefinite hours will
vanish. Then the wheat —which is a low-
wage industry and only kept afloat in many
cases because the small man who is his own
employer works very indefinite hours for a
return which is sometimes a great deal more
than 355. and sometimes less than nothing-
will begin to vanish also. In fact it is
diminishing already. It would do so faster
if the small farmer could put his hat on his
business as the artisan with some savings
can, and pack his tools —which include his
farm —into a kit, and go in search of better
prospects. As another feature, the industry
is constantly recruited by misguided ama-
teurs with a little money who go on the land
with , the idea that it is a haven for
their declining (or other) years. Super-
annuated sea-captains have a tendency
this way, and now the ranks of the
wheat-growers are to be strengthened
with returned soldiers with Government
capital to lose. Having Government capital
to lose they can be dotted on the land rather
casually. There was actually a proposal to
plant some at Ilillston (N.S.W.), marked
on the Statistician’s map as 04 miles further
west than the payable wheat growing line
as shown by the experience of 1912, and 150
miles further out than the line according to
the experience of 1904, a rather worse year.
The wheat-growing industry is almost
wholly dependent on carriage by railways
which are expected to pay all-round divi-
dends of 4 per cent. That is to say, every
mile of them is built with loan money which
costs that amount and is going to cost more.
In N. S. Wales more than half of the lines
pay only 1 per cent., and where there is a
chance to raise 0 per cent, to make up the
shortage 0 per cent, is raised. Out of the 38
railway companies in the thickly-peopled
British Isles 22 didn’t yield at latest returns
the rate that Australian railways, suffering
under the loan curse, are expected to realise
as a whole. The capital might be written
down by paying off part of the loans — Pri-
vate Enterprise always believes in writing
down the capital when it strikes a hopeless
snag—but that is never done. A larger pro-
portion of the wheat has to go by rail (and
after that for the longest possible distance
by sea) than in most countries, because
there are fewer people to the square mile
than in any other country to make a local
demand. There are no inland manufactur-
ing cities, as in every other country of im-
portance. to bring the local consumer close
to the producer’s door. In addition to that
there are only three ports—for Melbourne
and Geelong are really one, being on the
same inlet —from which wheat is allowed to
be shipped to any extent worth mentioning,
and the three serve 3000 miles of coast, so
they often have a distant habit or aspect
about them. Then in a country where, even
in the carefully-selected wheat area, any
fixed quantity of wheat is spread in good
years over about 24 times, and in bad years
over about 13 times the space which it occu-
pies in England, there is quite an amazing
amount of haulage to do, apart from the
lack of inland markets and the scattered
nature of the available ports and the long
sea-routes. Considering the failures through
: drought, the vast distances and the stagger-
ing mortgage on the railways, nobody ex-
I pects wheat, grown for export in competition
with Hindu and Argentine producers, to pay
Australian trade-union wages. A carefully
regulated amount exactly sufficient for local
supply could, of course, be grown at any
wages, for the loaf could be put up to any
price. So a tendency towards con-
solidating small wheat-farms into bigger
sheep-farms began to develop within
the last year or two. There was
no sign of a greatly-increased industrial
population to make a big local market, or of
less haulage to more adjacent ports, or of
the mortgage being taken off the railways.
The shipping muddle lost Australia the
grandest chance of half a century. The
war made labor more scarce and dearer
and an industrial award will make it dearer
still —-which any decent award should do.
The movement is being checked by putting,
or arranging to put, new small settlers on
the land with public money; but when they
have lost the public money it will appear
again, unless conditions change. The purely
sheep-man requires about 2000 acres in good
country to do well, for though he can make
good profits in good years, yet when he
strikes real disaster he does strike it. He
not only loses his crop, which is the wool,
but he loses practically his entire plant,
which is the sheep. The farmer’s plough
and harrow don’t die in the drought, but the
jumbuck does. Then it is estimated that the
sheep-man requires his good land at £3 per
acre, higher-priced soil being too expensive
for his animal to pay a dividend on. That is
why the sheep doesn’t flourish near Sydney
or Melbourne. The sheep-man expects to get
£3 per acre land closer in than heretofore
when the wheat bubble has burst and the
new amateur settlers have spent the public
money supplied therii. The attractive fea-
ture about his business is that it is worked
with a minimum of labor. It is a splendid
device for reducing population, and popula-
tion will have to be reduced in a great part
of Australia unless decentralisation and the
establishment of new industries lessen the
distance to a market and the number of
middlemen and brigands on the road (in-
cluding the holders of the gigantic mortgage
on the railways, and the outsider who owns
the ships, and the selling agents in Europe,
land the marine-insurance man) diminish.
In fact population is being reduced already
in all Victoria outside Melbourne, and all
S.A. outside Adelaide, and two-thirds of
N. S. Wales, though so far it is the country
towns which are doing the worst perish.
Close settlement may be set down as an ex-
periment which has failed, though the failure
is temporarily disguised by strenuous
finance.

BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.”
These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and while perhaps a few —the more
stoical among us —can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we
may all, with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the results
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance. To these fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need of help in toilet matters, and may be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and figure which is the birthright of
every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present, not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
A Beautiful Complexion by Natural Means.—
The secret of'a perfect complexion lies in the
continual renewing ''of the outer cuticle of the
skin. This is Nature's own method. The
outer skin as it becomes coarse or shrivelled
must be removed, and an opportunity given
to the finer one beneath to show itself. It is
because the old, dead skin is allowed to re-
main on the face that so many women, and
even young girls, suffer from pimples,
blotches and sallow dull skins. To remove, by
absorption, the dead outer skin, and with it
all blemishes, the use of mercolized wax is
universally recommended. ordinary face
creams being powerless for this purpose.
Smear the wax over the face and neck, rub it
gently into the skin, and leave it on all night.
In the morning trosh it off. using Pilenta
soap and warm water, when all the dead skin
will be removed with the wax. Then apply a
lotion to prevent any trace of greasiness
being noticeable and to give a peach-like
bloom to the skin. A lotion to do this can be
made up quite cheaply from the following
recipe: Take one ounce of cleminite and dis-
solve it in four tablespoonfuls of hot water.
Place in a bottle, and when cool apply to the
face with the fingertips, allowing it to dry on
the skin.
To Remove Blackheads.—Dissolve one effer-
vescing stymol tablet in a glass of hot water,
allow the effervescence to subside, then dip a
small sponge into the liquid and mop over the
face. Allow it to remain on for a few min-
utes, then wipe off with a towel, and the
blackheads will be entirely removed. To pre-
vent them from re-appearing, use a stymol
tablet in the manner described twice a week.
How to Shampoo.—Before shampooing the
hair dip the lingers into a little pure olive or
almond oil, and ’thoroughly massage the scalp.
Then dissolve a teaspoonful of Stallax granules
in a cup of hot water. Fill a basin with warm
water into which the ends of the hair can
fall, and shampoo the stallax mixture into the
roots in the usual way. Then rinse and dry
by fanning with a palm fan.
Grey Hair.—To restore the color of grey or
fading hair, take two ounces of concentrated
tammalite, and mix it with three ounces of
bay rum; apply to the hair for several nights,
using a small sponge, and the hair will grad-
ually resume its original color. When the
desired shade has been obtained, the tamma-
lite lotion should be used about twice a week.
Apply it to the roots with an old toothbrush
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
TO WHITEN A BROWN NECK (W.K.).— I To
whiten your neck, use jettaline. Get a tube
of this from the chemist and rub a little well
into the skin of the neck; leave it on till next
morning. Do this regularly every night for
three or four weeks, and you will find that
the skin will become beautifully clear and
white.
BABY.—You need not lose your pretty com-
plexion. Get a tin of mercolized wax, and
rub a little well into the face every night.
This well remove the dead outer skin and
reveal the pretty fresh new skin underneath.
Be careful what soap you use, as this is very
important. I should suggest Pilenta.
MATER.—To reduce yourself to your original
weight, get a packet of clynol berries and eat
four daily, one after each meal and one at
bedtime. When once you have returned to
your normal weight you can discontinue
them, as the cure is permanent and not merely
temporary, as so many others are. There is
no need to make any alteration in your diet.
DISAPPOINTED. —I am not surprised that
you have been disappointed in your hair: you
are not using a suitable shampoo. Get a
packet of stalTax and shampoo the hair every
fortnight with this. It will make it soft and
keep it fair. *
NELLIE. —There is nothing more disastrous
to beauty than superfluous hair. In that you
are right, but you are wrong in thinking that
there is no permanent cure. Get an ounce of
powdered pheminol and a tube of tekko paste.
These two, used in conjunction, will perma-
nently remove the growth.
GERTIE. —The lotion to which you refer is
made as follows: Get an ounce of cleminite
and mix it with four ounces of warm water.
Allow it to cool, bottle, and dab over the face,
allowing it to dry on the skin. This is far
superior to powder, and gives a fresh bloom
to the face without the appearance of make up.
MAISIE.—Yes. the longer your eyelashes the
larger and brighter your eyes will look. To
increase the growth of the lashes rub a little
mennaline into the roots every night. Do this
very gently, but thoroughly, and you will be
delighted with the result. [2

You Can Lay
Certain-teed
Yourself
No technical experience is re*
quired to lay Certain-teed Roof-
ing. It is a task so simple and
easy that anyone can do it. The
necessary nails and liquid lap
cement, together with full direc-
tions for laying, are packed in
the center of each roll.
Because it is so economical to
buy and lay and so efficient and
durable on any type of roof,
Certain-teed is the first choice
—everywhere. More than one-
fourth of all the roll roofing used
throughout the world comes
from the great Certain-teed
factories —thelargest roll roofing
factories in the world.
Certain-teed is weatherproof
and fire-resisting. It does not af-
fect the taste or odour of water.
Permit us to show you samples
and explain why it is the best
roofing for your building.

claims praise for two widely different re-
forms. One is - economy, an overdraft of
£sooo(estimated at the beginning of the year)
having somehow been converted into a
small credit balance. The other is care of
babies, in which a local School for Mothers
has a big part. The loss of children under
a year old for the past 12 months is only 41
per thousand, which is easily the lowest on
record. In fact, Mayor Glover reports that
he cannot find any figures elsewhere in the
world lower than the 50 of Maoriland in
1915. The “Yearbook of the Commonwealth'’
shows that Australia, as a whole, lost over
67 infants out of every 1000 born between
1905 and 1915.
“Figurehead”: “Helwena” (B. 21/11/T8)
disputes my assertion that the clipper Cutty
Sark made the record trip of 55 days from
London to Melbourne in 1875-76. My
authority (carefully consulted before pub-
lication) for the statement was culled from
the report of Captain A. Iv. Watson, then
an officer of the vessel, backed by C. Allaire,
a member of the crew from ’69 to ’76, and
Robert Burns, member of the crew of the
old-time flier Decapolis. and seconded by
“Lloyds’ Annual.” The Nauticai, Magazine
of Feb., 1917, also bears out what I have
said.
11. Heaton, director of the tutorial classes
at Adelaide University, hangs up his bit o’
prophecy:—■
The great industrial expansion of Japan, coupled
with the increase in her shipping and her success in
securing control over the coal and iron deposits in
China, is going to make her a formidable competi-
tor. Another serious factor in economics is the
entry of the United States into the ranks of the
first-class shipping Powers. Fierce competition may
be expected in many markets, including that of Aus-
tralia, between Japan, the United States, Great
Britain and (perhaps) Germany—competition which
may result in the rivals being willing to sell their
goods at a loss in order to regain markets.
Of course, we might try a little Tariff Pro-
tection, but that would be a slight on the
foreign-trade party and the fiscal-sinking
Labor party and sundries.
“G. Arden Hill”: The sight of stunted
crops on the South Coast (N.S.W.) would
discourage a Mark Tapley. Hand feeding
is general, and farmers are buying large
quantities of bran and chaff in anticipation
of the worst. Water is scarce and the milk
yield below normal. It was not always so
in the famous Illawarra and Shoalhaven
districts. Twenty-five years ago the stall-
feeding of dairy cattle would have been re-
garded as a fad. The pastures did not
shrivel up to the extent that they do now,
and in any case there was always a supply
of succulent planter’s friend or broadcast as
a stand-by and by way of variety to form a
balanced ration ; and the summer production
paid well at 6d. per gallon wholesale. (It’s
Is. now.) The reason for this retrogression
is that these dairying lands, after being
worked continuously for upwards of a cen-
tury, without any reparation in the way of
fertilising and top-dressing, have lost the
stamina that in earlier days enabled them to
outlast a dry spell. The soil is clamoring
for nourishment, while the farmer sits on
his cockatoo-fence lamenting the passing of
the good old days and praying (or cursing)
for rain. In the thickly-populated countries
of the Northern Hemisphere the soil is treated
as a living thing (which it really is), and
fed and watered and groomed in order to
obtain the best results. Otherwise millions
of people would be looking to Heaven for
manna. The N.S.W. Department of Agricul-
ture has for years past carried out experi-
ments in agricultural and dairying districts,
demonstrating in a practical ivay. by grow-
ing crops side by side in fertilised and non-
fertilised soil, the enormous advantages of
the former. So, too, in the matter of top-
dressing. But the dairy-farmer takes a cur-
sory interest in these proceedings and no
practical results are achieved. His depend-
ence upon Providence is absolute and pathetic.
Lieut.-Colonel Charles Arthur Lee, son
of C. A. Lee, M.L.A., who recently
went west at his father’s house in
Tenterfield (N.S.W.) from shattered nerves,
probably saw more active service than any
other Aussie soldier his age. Enlisting as a
private, although holding a lieutenant’s com-
mission, lie went through the Boer war.
Present when Gronje surrendered at Paarde-
burg, he contracted enteric fever shortly after,
and was one of the first three Aussie officers
invalided to England. On recovery he went
back and saw the thing through. When the
Huns broke loose he at once offered his ser-
vices and was sent to Egypt. Was in charge
of the Lone Pine trenches at Gallipoli, and
at the evacuation swam out to a boat with
the last eight men to leave. Not satisfied, he
helped to chase the Senussi off the premises
in charge of the 4th L.H. Brigade. Palestine
was next on the programme, and he was pre-
sent at the taking of Beersheba and Jeru-
salem. Promoted, he was given charge of the
4th Camel Corps. After much hard service
he was sent home (in charge of a transport)
suffering with shattered nerves and shell-
shock. He was for some time in a military
hospital in Brisbane, and had only returned
to his father’s home and Tenterfield about a
week when the call came. Only 44 at the
finish.
South Aus. Education Department is
noted for having the poorest-paid servants in
the Commonwealth ; but it gets in its finest
cheeseparing on the high-school teachers.
Many of these highly-educated specialists
have to struggle along on £4 a week —a salary
at which many a clerk would scoff. In the
Adelaide High School (1000 students) there
are eight male assistants in receipt of
salaries over £2OO, two of these over £250 ;
while in the Melbourne High School, where
the average attendance is not more than 700,
19 male teachers receive over £240 and nine
of these over £3OO. At Hobart High School,
average roll 300, there are positions carrying
salaries of £320 to £370. In one high school
in Adelaide two men received appointments
at £l3O and £l4O, but the man in charge, who
directed and was responsible for the work,
got the staggering stipend of £l3o—that is,
£lO less than one of hi s subordinates! Wheat
employees received 16s. a day, much more
than those with a wide professional know-
lege of teaching. Of 50 teachers who have
taken degrees in the high schools, nearly 40
per cent, have resigned.

DON’T DRUG YOUR NERVES.
IF THEY ARE WEAK TAKE PHOS-
PHATE WITH YOUR MEALS.
Some drugs lessen the sensitiveness of the
nervous system so that the brain acts slowly,
the neiwes do not respond readily to the
directions of the brain, and every function
of the body is retarded. Others act as a
lash to the nerves, so that the user is fired
temporarily with feverish energy. Both are
equally dangerous, for there is the inevitable
reaction which leaves the sufferer far worse
than before. Therefore, don’t drug your
nerves! Get to understand them and study
their needs. Nerves give way because they
are weak, and they become weak through
lack of food and nourishment. The futility
of thrashing a. starved horse is obvious, and
it is just as. futile and just as foolish to lash
weak, exhausted nerves by the administration
of violent drugs. Nerves feed on phosphate,
which they extract from digested food, and
the fact that your nerves are weak proves
they are not obtaining sufficient phosphate
for their needs. You can remedy this seri-
ous fault by providing your nerves with
phosphate, in a readily assimilable form, a
most suitable and convenient being bitro-
phosphate. which most chemists stock in the
form of 5-grain compressed tablets. Take
one of these small tablets immediately after
every meal and you will soon note a
decided improvement in your health. Your
nerves will become steady and strong, your
brain will act quickly and clearly; your
appetite will improve; you will sleep better,
and wake up bright and refreshed, charged
with an abundance of vital energy sufficient
to carry you through the most strenuous day.

Students of the Teachers' College had their
annual three days’ show in the Education
Department’s galleries' last week. It was
possibly the best exhibition, in spite- of weak
places, the College has invited the public to
consider. The nursery-rhyme illustrations,
as decorative friezes for youngsters’ rooms,
were, on the whole, bold and spirited and
imaginative in design. On the other hand,
most of the sketches from the nude deserved
all the bad marks libelled woman could give
them. The female form was tortured into
some weird apparitions. Some fourth-year
students showed great promise in the water-
color section. Arts, and crafts exhibits
attained a respectable standard of decent
mediocrity. The Kindergarten section by
students of the system was excellent. Not
up to the early-Victorian standard was the
sampler—though good in its way—chiefly
because the modern kiddie has a hundred
diversions. Whereas little Emily .Tane of
long ago had patiently to “execute” in cross-
stitch both prayer and praise and repent-
ance for her deadly sins (at the age of eight)
every day of her life.
When the dear old Family Herald used
to wiud up its reel of romance with a landau
that dropped the heroine at the church door,
St George’s, Hanover Square, was usually
the finale. Nowadays, the Chapel Royal,
Savoy (London), has been the scene of
fashionable marriage-parades. Two Aus-
tralians were wed there last month. The
bride was Mary Nortliooto, youngest hope of
the Edward Northcote, of Toorak, Mel-
bourne, and a N. S. Wales man, Lieut. Jack
Sanger, M.C., R.F.A, of Corowa, was the
ring-giver. The Northcotes are related to the
late kindly ■ little man wlm was a former
Governor-General of Australia.
Lady Davidson, who goes hard at any-
thing she takes up, is on the sporty side.
" She will fish from dawn to dusk on a holi-
day, and she spent most of last week beguil-
ing the trout in the clear cold stream at
Adaminaby.
Only the late Harry Levy’s near friends
and relatives knew how seriously ill lie had
been for three or four months. The kindly
Sydney business man passed out suddenly
in the end, at Hillside, the roomy mansion
he bought a few years ago on the brow of
Edgecliff-road. Mrs. Harry has been one
of this town’s most decorative matrons for
a long innings.
Homeward bound by the Niagara on her
next trip this way is Lieut.-Colonel Sturdee,
of the Royal Australian Engineers, after
nearly four years of active service. The
young Victorian, a nephew of Admiral Stur-
dee, of Falkland fame, was a subaltern in
the Australian Permanent Force, and had
the luck to get away early in the fray. The
Defence Department hung on to the gun-
ners, by the way, but left the active service
door ajar for the Engineers. Mrs. Sturdee,
who’s been some time in England, comes
home with her sapper.
Left Sydney last week on a health trip
to the Solomons, that A. S. Meek who wrote
“A Naturalist in Cannibal Land.” In a
pompous preface by millionaire Walter
Rothschild (Tring. 1913) the very rich man
speaks of this distinguished entomologist
with complacence as “our traveller.” Meek,
for years—just now he is resting—went
through many hardships in tropic jungles,
and at the risk of his life captured many
priceless treasures (because so rare) for
the Rothschild collection. He hunted ex-
German New Guinea, the Solomons, Papua
and a score of Pacific islets with a butterfly
net. Naturally, as the preface says, “Our
intercourse with the traveller has always
remained most pleasant.”
The lady who beat thousands of competi-
tors when she secured No. 200 in the Linen
Chest Art Union, is Mrs. O. Edwards, wife
of Wollongong’s police-magistrate. It happens
she’s been a keen war-worker since, the be-
ginning of the row.
The war brought even Persia a few
leagues nearer Sydney. Mesopotamia also
steps this way. In the display of old origi-
nal brass and copper ware to be on view
at the coming Christmas gife sale for the
4th D.A.C. and Ist Light Horse, both these
countries will be represented. An Aussie
sent the stuff to be sold for “Comforts.”
Deceniber 16 and 17 are the dates, and the
place of barter will be 24 Castlereagh-street.
Details of the wedding of Enid Purves,
only daughter of the late well-known Sydney
auctioneer. J. M. Purves, came by the last
mail. The ’groom was Edward Metcalfe,
chief of Central College, Mysore University,
and the knot was tied on October 2 at Ban-
galore, Southern India. Mother was on the
spot to give her girl away in St. Mark’s
Church.
Mrs. Britton had an appreciative
cheque pressed into her hand the other
afternoon. Mrs. Holman delivered the pre-
sent in the Queen Victoria Club on behalf
of the lady’s many friends. Mrs. Britton
drives a busy pen to aid daughter Theo-
dosia’s work in the same calling. The late
Alex. Britton was sub-editor of Mel-
bourne Argus, and later on of S. M.
Herald. In 1890 he edited the second
volume of the “Ofiicial History of N. S.
Wales,” a Government production. G. B.
Barton was in charge of the first volume.
Lieut. Jean Noellat, who was lately made
a ■ Chevalier of the Legion of Honor for con-
spicuous bravery during the passage of the
Avre, last August, was the first soldier from
Noumea to win the distinction. The Cross
was handed to him by the General of his
division before the company assembled in
arms. He had previously won the Croix de
Guerre, with two additional palms. Mrs.
Eric Roberts, of Mosman (Sydney), is his
sister.
A link with the long-dead past went over
last week at Chatswood. This was Janetta
Louisa Richards, widow of Thomas Mor-
ton Richards, solicitor, who practised at
Shoalhaven. and was coroner there in the
’eighties. The lady, who had reached her
94th year, was a daughter of Colonel Moris-
set, 48th Regiment, who in his turn was
Commandant of Norfolk Island and police-
magistrate at Bathurst.
Artist-soldier Waller’s young wife, for-
merly an art student in Melbourne, came
over the Murray with her returned warrior.
She is just a slip of a girl with the same
lack of money-sense, which is patent after a
calm contemplation of her husband’s notion
of picture-pricing. In answer to a question
as to why such modest tabs, she replied for
both: “Oh, but we don’t mind, so long as
the people who really wanted them” (the
pictures) “were able to buy them!” A naive
and child-like vision of the commercial side
of art, which makes no allowance for the
speculator. '
The sub-regal Davidsons, : with the two
small daughters, camped in a decorated box
at Her Majesty’s Theatre for last week’s
“Katinka” matinee. The just-home Anzacs
and their mothers, aunties and best girls
were the guests that the J.C.W. firm
delighted to have under its- roof. Hugh
Ward was responsible for the gathering of
sunbaked veterans. Oratory flowed from
his Ex., Premier Holman and Assistant
Minister for Repatriation Orchard.
The Anzacs have been hard pressed for
time since they got back to Australia, but
one of them, Quartermaster Sergeant Ivir-
wan, of Adelaide, managed to meet his sweet-
heart in St. Andrew’s Cathedral the other
afternoon and insisted upon marrying her.
She is a Londoner —Miss Minnie Barker—
with relatives in this town. Uncle Elliott
gave his niece to her favorite soldier.
Glady’s Verona (her daddy’s name is
Bourke), a Sydney soprano with a phe-
nomenal range, has been almost unnoticed
in her native State
—or she was until
her singing at a
recent recital in the
C o n s e r v a torium
made concert de-
votees sit., up and
hurriedly re-read
their programme
notes. These in-
cluded a chorus of
praise from inter-
state papers, pub-
lished last year
during the Corn-
stalk’s tour with the
Cappelli co. in S.
Australia, Victoria
and Bananaland.
Next year, admirers
of this beautiful
voice will probably take steps to put the
owner of it in the way of a big career. That
means Europe and a training in grand
’ opera. Hitherto Gladys Verona has been
excellently trained here by Roland Foster,
at the Conservatorium. Photo by Riley.
The Munro Fergusons had their Sunday
dinner at the Eadith Walker mansion,
Yaralla. His Ex. hurried off that evening to
. have a few words with the young gentlemen
l at the Military College, Duntroon, on the
next morning. lu the Yaralla week-end
party was the good-looking Joan Tregarthen.
Dad used to, be the Sydney manager of the
P. and O. Co.
Quietly married, in St. Mary’s the other
' week, Emma Franceschi, daughter of the
Italian doctor at Lismore. The happy man
was Timothy Sullivan of the same town.
Emma was the operatic song-bird who had a
couple of years’ study in Italy till the war
called a halt.
In the early stress of 1915 the Ist and
53rd Battalion Comforts Fund dames began
their knitting. The 53rd, to be sure, was
a later tail, which
began to wag as
some of the Ist Bat-
talion men were
transferred to the
double number. The
hon. organiser was
Mrs. Glanville, whose
photo. is inset.
With a break for ill-
ness, largely due to
overwork, she has
never faltered in
long years of purl
and plain. Week in,
week out, and every
day this staunch
friend of Billjim
has been in her
accustomed place in
the George - street
depot. There are between 60 and 70 woi’k-
ing members who give the same devoted
allegiance to the man at the Front. Every
fortnight, shipping provided, the depot has
posted about 300 pairs of socks to its infan-
trymen. This is an extra, by way of
keeping in personal touch with its little lot.
For the N. S. Wales War Chest, fed by
the- Comforts Fund women, swallows the
bulk of woollen goods for the general fund
abroad. With Peace comes the query: Is
Rilljim going to lose touch with the women
whose organisations for supplying him with
the little luxuries of life have made that
casual hero the envy of every other soldier V
From Brisbane: —
Mrs. H. C. Mustard, who was Ivo Bienan, one
of our prettiest girls, fed a big party at Lennon’s
Hotel the other day, before returning to the Feder-
ated Malay States.
Marjorie Brown, a pretty girl with hosts of
friends in Brisbane and Toowoomba, was married
last week to Jim Scrymgeour, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Scrymgeour, of Callandoon station. The bridegroom
put in-some years with the 2nd L.H., and recently
earne home badly wounded.
The Premier and Mrs. Ryan have been farewelled
by lots of societies and organisations, but at present
they are not sure when they will leave for England.
Their ship is. the much-delayed Makura.
Col. Graham Butler, D. 5.0., of the A.A.M.C., re-
turned to Brisbane last week after four years of
active service. lie was given a tremendous wel-
come by the men of the 9th and 49th Battalions.
Thelma Taylor, the pretty younger daughter of
the Taylors of Russell Park station, is to be
married in Toowoomba to Leo Wright, who hails
from N. S, Wales.
News: has just arrived of the marriage in Lon-
don, on September 12, of Lieut. C. E. Plant, M.M.,
to Gladys Rowe, daughter of Rev. G. E. and Mrs.
Rowe, Brisbane. The wedding cake, which had
travelled all the way from Brisbane, created a
sensation among guests used to a microscopic sugar
ration.
Architect G. M. Addison’s son George, who went
away in the original 9th Battalion and won a
commission in France, is on his way home after
four years’ service.
The latest engagement is that of Alma .Johnston,
second daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. Johnston,
Vvindsor, to Lieut. F. W. Stratford, of Lismore.
The Sydney Academy of Music put its
best talent forward in producing, under
Oswald. Anderson’s baton, “The Girl from
U.S.A.” A five-nights’ run at the Reper-
tory for various comforts funds (the North
Shore Hospital got a snack besides) of Les
Williams’s bright little musical comedy showed
what local stage ability can do. A profes-
sional touch was the “Russian Ballet,’’ a
dance by Gwen Nelson. The Sydney girl
learnt in the Pavlova School —a distinct cult
of its own—in U.S.A. last year. Though
dancers, like cooks, are born they can be
impi’oved in the making, and when young
Australia exerts herself in this direction
the Russian damsel has to move to catch the
applause. Little Nellie Hugo’s “Doll Dance”
was another attractive item.
Sydney High School boys waded brain-
deep into Shakspearean recital the • other
afternoon. Pupils of Rose Seaton supported
the meritorious effort, which was made in
St. James’s Hall. H. W. Moffi'tt, M.A.. of
the Boys’ High at Ultimo, was the organiser.
The keen interest, by the way, shown by
High School boys and girls (there were 380
muslin frocks at last week’s Schools’ per-
formance in St. James’s Hall) in Shak-
spearean recitals is convincing the Educa-
tion Department of the Bard’s hold on the
Australian upper-school forms. In the list
of youngsters who did well were M. W.
Flannery as Le Beau (“As You Like It”>.
Mollie Kirwan as Viola in “Twelfth Night,”
Gladys Canning as Feste, and R. G. Laws,
who gave a capital inteapretation of Sir
Andrew Aguecheek.
Three years’ soldieidng has left Laurence
Godfrey Smith a more soulful pianist than it
found him. Or, has the new and charming
Mrs. L. G. Smith been the witch to round off
the hard edges V Anyhow, a big Conserva-
torium audience early in last week gave the
smart-looking R.F.A. lieut. tumultuous
appreciation. Mowat Carter was in his.
accustomed place behind a violin. “The
Ballad of the Despairing,” in spite of the
theatrical flavor, inevitable when a Speaking
Voice is used in a vocal and instrumental
wail, was an interesting interlude. Mrs.
Alex. Gordon, rolling her soft eyes to the
roof, warbled sweetly of the Tomb. Mrs.
T. H. Kelly spake the Word. T. li. Kelly
was busy at a fiddle. Brenda Deloitte drew
deep sobs from a ’cello, and Gladys Teece
was at the piano.
Essie Clamp kept her appointment with/
Cardiff Lewis in St. Mark’s Church (Dar-
ling Point), with Archbishop Wright’s lawn-
sleeves to assist at the knot-tying. The
Darling Point girl is a daughter of architect
Burchamp Clamp.
Major Ronald Osborne, who captured a
M.C. a good while ago on the French Front,
has been handed another decoration, the Croix
de Guerre, for bravery. He is a son of the
late W. A. Osborne, of Orange, and Mrs.
Osborne, of Mosman. He left here with the
Field Artillery in 1915.
The new Red Cross Convalescent Home
at Exeter will be opened by Governor David-
son on Dec. 14. Those interested, who like
train-travelling, will leave Sydney station
at 7.50 a.m. or 9.45 a.m. and will start on
the home journey at 5.44 p.m.
There was a cordial rally amongst the
chaplains and officers of the just-closed
Liverpool Camp in Farmer’s the other after-
noon. The idea behind the offering of the
cream-puff was to say “Thank you” to Mrs.
George Earp, who lias been general rouse-
about of the Soldiers’ Entertainment Com-
mittee.
A Sydney audience surreptitiously fanned
itself (100 deg. in the shade was the bulb read-
ing) at the Conservatorium on Saturday after-
noon. The last orchestral concert of the
Verbrugghen 1918 season was the draw. In
spite of the heat the hall was packed. Bee-
thoven’s overture “Leonora No. 3” (the
third overture the master wrote, for his one
opera) was a splendid thing. The orchestra
had to mop its brow after the remarkably
fine performance, for Leonora 3 was an
exhausting lady to handle in a heat-wave.
Patti Russell (a pupil of Mrs. Slapoffski)
\yas the soloist in the Schubert aria, “The
Shepherd on the Rock.” A violin concerto
by Saint-Saens, performed by Jennie Cullen,
was a feature of th.e programme. The Con-
servatorium staff' will shortly get about 10
weeks’ holidays, in which to cool off.
Mr. Hanson (of Lawrence and Hanson)
is rejoicing in consequence of a cable that
came last week from his son, who was study-
ing at Brest, in France, at the outbreak of
war, and had not been heard of since. He is
well.

There is an Oxy-Acetylene Welder in your dis-
trict always ready for service in saving money,
whether you are a farmer, tradesman, house-
holder or the owner of the greatest workshop,
foundry or factory in Australia.
Tools and machinery to the value of thousands
of pounds were thrown on the scrap-heap every
year until the arrival of the Oxy-Acetylene
Welding Process.
The illustrations shown on the left are typical
examples of hundreds of little repairs that
mean big savings to all users of tools, and in
every case the Oxy-Acetylene Welder saved the
cost of a new implement because no other pro-
cess could give the strength required.
The Oxy-Acetylene Welding Process is
a great factor of economy in the house-
hold, enabling you have metal kit-
chen utensils repaired, which
otherwise would go to the rub-
bish-heap. In fact there is no
broken or cracked metal part that the
Oxy-Acetylene Blowpipe will not weld;
whether it be Cast or Wrought Iron,
Mild Steel, Brass, Copper, Aluminium
or Gun-metal.
There is no limit to its use wherever metal has to be joined, from the small-
est garden-tool to the largest machine on the farm or in the workshop. What-
ever, your repairs to metal parts, take them to. the Oxy-Acetylene Welder,
there is one near you.

Melba is to give a concert at the Town
Hall on the 17th. While the war lasted her
voice was uplifted only on patriotic occa-
sions. Nellie once had the pleasure of
giving W. Ilohenzollern a free music-lesson
when he was least expecting it. Many years
ago she was singing “Lucia” in Berlin, and
between the acts was summoned to the royal
ante-room, after having been warned that
she must not have any scent about her, as
the All Highest objected to it. Wilhelm lost
no time in announcing that he did not
approve of the way the sestet was sung—it
had been taken too quickly. Melba remained
discreetly silent. The royal ass repeated the
opinion, and asked if she did not agree. She
didn’t, and said so, whereupon Gott’s senior
partner glared and walked away, peremp-
torily signing to the Ivaiserin to follow.
Melba is arranging to sing to the Anzacs
a day or two after her own farewell concert
on December 17. She has begged the Town
Hall from the Gaud Mayor for the occasion.
Dudley Stone, a son of Lieut.-Governor
Stone of Westralia, died the other day after
a long, gradual breaking-down. While at
college in England, years ago, young Stone
went boating. The rest of (lie party con-
sisted of an elderly friend and the boatman,
and during the trip the craft was upset.
Stone managed to save the life of the old
man, but the boatman was drowned. The
shock gave the youth’s constitution a blow
from which it never recovered.
The Monash dame and her' daughter have
received cabled sailing orders for England in
March.
Western District squatter Tom Millear
and his wife (she was one of the late Tooralc
parson Fellowes’ trio of daughters) are still
scattering thousand-pound cheques to sol-
diers’ comforts funds. Another drifted in
this week for Anzacs overseas. In addition
to this they have given £5OOO to establish
Grammar School scholarships for sons of dead
or disabled Australian soldiers.
Harry Holden, manager of The Grand for
10 years, has bought Clifton Springs Hotel,
and will be on the job there within a week.
Clifton Springs is where Billy Hughes used
to rest whenever he could spare a few days
from making speeches and winning the war.
The Dawsons are wandering round Singa-
pore on their way to Calcutta. Mrs. Daw-
son was May Stewart, of the Snowy River,
before she attached her Cambridge husband.
The Nicholls dame from Hobart has been
inspecting Ballarat through her lorgnette.
She went there with the delegates to the
Baby Welfare Conference.
Herbert Austin, a son of Herbert Austin
of Narmbool squattage, Elaine, recently came
back from the Front to have a nice peaceful
time. The other day he took a little horse
exercise at the Ballarat agricultural show
and got a worse shaking than the Hun had
ever given him. He is recovering, however.
Captain Frank Keone, one of the original
Anzacs, is home again after four years’ ser-
vice. His surgical work in the field was so
good that he was put in charge of the
Second Military Hospital at Rouen. He was
once blown into the air, but was mended suc-
cessfully, and is now ready to pick up the
threads of his neglected medical practice.
Though a very young man, Keone had
already begun to make a name as a nerve
specialist.
Mrs. Tallis, with bright red poppies in her
hat, Mrs. Robins and Miss Munce engineered
a crowded tea-and-music party at Buckley’s
Tea Rooms last Thursday. The entire cash
proceeds were for the Blind Institute. Buck-
ley’s gave the rooms and supplied the elabo-
rate tea-and-strawberry menu, and theatrical
folk unleashed the music.
Major McKinley, of Malvern, gave a big
party on Monday evening of last week to the
delegates of the Children’s Welfare Confer-
ence. The host lived up to his reputation of
“doing things well.” The place was carpeted
and the seats were cushioned lounges. The
supper kept the epicures rolling their eyes
for days after. The Curator of the Mal-
vern Gardens filled the Town Hall with
blooms and vegetation. Premier Lawson and
his wife were guests, also Norman Bayles,
the Hagelthorns and the Hennessys.
Latest Victorian V.C. is Lieut. W. D.
Joynt (of Sth Battalion), who hails from
Flinders Island. He is the first old boy of
Melbourne Grammar to win the Cross, and
Grammar boys these days smile cheerfully,
as they now equal their ancient rival—Wes-
ley—which claims Capt. Bobby Grieve, V.C.
Church of England Grammar speech day
had a matchless advantage in being the
first after the war’s ending. Chief
Justice Irvine was at his very best in a
compact, fiery little oration, with the con-
centration of a brick-kiln. Canon Girdle-
stone’s report, as locum tenens headmaster,
was the most eloquent that old friends of
the school have heard.
The first woman to sign the rolls of Mel-
bourne University as a matriculated student
died lately. She was Miss C. A. M. Boyd,
formerly of Bendigo, whose father, uncle and
three brothers were doctors.
Mr. Leclerq-Motte, one of the French Mis-
sion, gave a farewell party on Saturday
night to numerous friends he had made in
Melbourne. He took his guests to “Hello,
Everybody !” and slippered them afterwards
at Scott’s. Colonel and Mrs. Sands were
guests of honor.
Adelaide’s observations: —
Last week-end brought us an orgy of patriotic
entertainments —the second day of the Cheer-Up
Society’s American Carnival at the Jubilee Oval, a
Trench Comforts Fete at Keswick and another at
Hawthorne, with the Defenders’ Friendship Associa-
tion and the Artillery Comforts Club as its organ-
isers and its proceeds dedicated to a local Repatria-
tion Fund. In the evening a massed-choir concert
in the Town Hall brought in money for the Metho-
dist War Memorial Hospital that is to be installed in
the Simpson Newlands’ one-time house in North
Adelaide.
Died in camp in England on November 26, after
nearly four years’ active service, l’te. J. R. Sadlier,
youngest son of the late Nicholas Sadlier, who once
owned Albermarle station. A sister and two brothers
are still on active service.
We have added a Doctor of Music, Miss Davy, of
Salisbury, to our list of feminine notables. She
took her Mus. Bac. degree when only 21, and her
latest achievement has made her the pioneer woman
of Australia to win the right to put Mus. Doc. after
her name. Indeed, only one other similar degree has
been awarded in Australia, and that went to Dr.
E. H. Davies, of this city.
A D.S.O. has come to Capt. E. J. McCloughry,
D.F.C., whose brother Wilfred, also a flying-man, won
his M.C. some time ago.
Wallaroo’s total collection for patriotic funds has
now passed the £lO,OOO total, plus endless quan-
tities of goods sent from the local branches of the
Red Cross and Cheer-Up Societies to Adelaide head-
quarters. Over £2500 of the cash has come from
the employees of the smelting works as deductions
from their pay.
Dr. Ennis, who has just resigned his position as
Professor of Music and Director of the Elder Con-
sei'vatorium, has been very ill in Melbourne. Mrs.
Ennis, who left for Victoria on Wednesday, reports
him better, though still very weak.
The Rev. 11. F. Severn and his wife have booked
their passages for England after nearly six years in
charge of the Anglican Church at Port Pirie. A
rectorate awaits him in the diocese of Bath and
Wells, of which his uncle, Dr. Kennion (once
Bishop of Adelaide), is bishop. They leave in
March. John Lewis is also to leave us for a world-
wander.
There was mild excitement on the Iveswick-road
the other morning, when the Galway lady’s motor
set itself on fire. She is a keen chaffeuse, and was
driving herself back from the Military Hospital when
the blaze occurred. Fortunately there were helpers
by to deal with it, and no great damage was done.
Poet C. J. Dennis and his wife returned to Mel-
bourne on Saturday.
The French Red Cross appeal made its official
debut at the Bank of Thrift on Monday afternoon,
when £lOOO was handed to General Pan as the
Children’s Patriotic B’und contribution to the needs
of his country’s Red Cross. There was an informal
visit to the Cheer-Up Hut on Monday, which gave
the General an opportunity of expressing his per-
sonal thanks for the hospitality many French troops
have received there, and also for the good work the
Hut has put in on behalf of the Societe Maternelle.
Adelaide is aspiring to hold an exhibition in 1919
with the big-sounding name, the All-Aulstralian
Peace Exhibition. It is expected to remain open for
a couple of months.
Launceston and
the Speck generally
are going to feel a
wrench in public
affairs when Mrs.
Keating leaves them.
She will be following
in the trail of her
husband when that
barrister begins to
practise in Mel-
bourne. Mrs. Keat-
ing was the first to
introduce Lady Dud-
ley’s Bush Nursing
scheme into Tas-
mania. She has
always fostered that.
Now she is battling
against municipal
stagnation, and urg-
ing councils to devote more thought to the
care of women and children. The busy
woman is also heart and head of the Baby
Clinic (Launceston boasts that its quarters
are secpna to none in Australia) ; also any-
thing • that has to do with the welfare of
returned soldiers can always rely on her
help. This portrait is by Ruth Hollick.
Novelist Katherine Pritchard, who has
lately been leading a solitary existence at
the Louis Essons’ house at Emerald, putting
the finishing touches to a new book, will
next month trip altarwards with Captain
Hugo Throssell. the big, good-natured West-
ralian pastoralist, who served on Gallipoli
and was one of the earliest Australians to
annex a V.C. He is a son of the late George
Throssell. once Premier of W.A.. The two
met in London at the Royal Automobile
Club, and the Captain at once fell a victim
to Ivathie’s soft voice and gracious ways.
Nurse Matrin, of the A.1.F., is to marry
A. C. Frazer, a returned warrior. The bride-
elect is a daughter of the Thomas Matrins
of The Netherlands, near Sale. Her young
man is a sheep-grower of Sydenham.
Banker Wren’s only girl, Marjorie, col-,
laborated in a surprise wedding with Light
Horse Major Wilbur Ham on November 30.
The engagement had been kept a really
secret. The bride, who dimpled prettily in
white muslin, was handed over by her dad.
Chaplin Larry Rentoul was the parson on
the job, Elaine Moxon Cooke was the only
bridesmaid, and medical Colonel Balcombe
Quick was best man, after the bridegroom.
The newly-linked, who are honeymooning at
Braemar, will spend the next six months in
the Quicks’ flat at South Yarra.
Gertrude Alger,
wli om Rembrandt
here depicts, might
have reached her pre-
sent position in
music much earlier
if neuritis had not
compelled her to put
her fiddle away and
rest her supple fin-
gers for a consider-
able time. During
this period she took
up nursing, and
found a suitable post
in a hospital in Eng-
land. Since her arri-
val in Australia she
has returned to her
violin with a talent
unimpaired by the
long separation. The critics have said the
nicest things and the general musical public
has enjoyed her immensely. It is a well-
deserved success, especially as she is
entirely uninfluenced by foreign maestros or
local conservatoriums. Musically she is the
gifted product of her father, who took her in
hand at an early age and put her through a
course of training that would make many
another student call for help. When her
technique was maturing, he gave her Paga-
nini’s enormously difficult “Witches’ Dance,’’
which few first-class violinists ever attempt
in public, and he promised her a gold watch
if she could play it in two years. She was
note-perfect in six months, and recently did
it with unfaltering confidence at Melbourne
Auditorium.
The bachelor days of Major Hilary I.
Carlile, A.A.M.C. (“Crock” in his ’Varsity
days), younger son of the late knight Ed-
ward Carlile, end this week. lie is a 1914
Anzac returned “on duty.” llis “surprise”
bride (it was a great secret) is Dora
Weigall, daughter of cheery Dr. Reginald,
of Elsternwick.
Tenor Kirby is gradually starting concert
work again after his numerous illnesses. He
lately organised a concert at Marysville, and
the little mountain village raised £l2O for
the Red Cross.
Ambitious Fritz Ilart is out after big
game. His latest little thing is Shakspeare
set to opera. The first act of “Malvolio”
was given in the Playhouse, on Thursday
night, as a curtain-raiser to Gluck’s
“Orpheus.” Fritz had his full orchestra, and
it filled the Playhouse to bursting point.
Melba beamed from the balcony in a bluey-
green gown, and had son George and Mrs.
George with her. The gold-latticed boxes
were filled with finery. Melba coached the
girl stars in the opera. She had reason for
pride in Thelma Carter, who warbled for
Orpheus. Thelma wore Grecian dress show-
ing admirable legs in high red-laced foot-
wear. Mrs. Fritz Hart designed the
“Orpheus” costumes, and Miss Leadbeater
got her designing pencil to work for “Mal-
volio.”
Quite a smart house turned up to watch
Allen Bindley’s amateurs wrestle with
“Boccaccio” at the Princess’s on Saturday.
For one night only bare shoulders and
boiled shirts replaced the customary hordes
of depressed mothers with babies, and the
whole place wore quite a festive air. Up in
the circle were several incorrigible first-
nighters. including two lots of Taits; and
in the front stalls the youth, -beauty and
intellect of sassiety were scattered into par-
ties of many familiar faces. About the
largest was shepherded by John Thomp-
son, who bore his responsibility with
all the decayed and distant grandeur of
one of the old nobility. Up on the stag
there was evidently keen rivalry tor tne
plaudits of the populace, and the climax
came when the two leading ladies stood up
tor the bombardment of vegetation. About
four tons of vegetation were shot at tne
damsels, but the surplus was well in avor
of the principal boy. Zoe Wenke. who lelt
the other, Daisy Bindley, comparatively un-
it garded.
The Playhouse roped in a full house on
Saturday night for Fritz Hart’s second out-
break of opera. Orpheus, in the Gluck
opera, was a different star this time. Rose
Atkinson, a Westraliau girl with a tine
voice, got into the short tunic and scarlet
leg-lacings of the lead instead of Thelma
Carter. Mrs. Deakin was in a box with
daughter Mrs. Brookes, and Mrs. Dalrymple
had a party in another gold-latticed pen.
The Gaud Mayoral Cabenas were behind
their eyeglasses in centre circle. British
Trade Commissioner McGregor looked
solemn in the stalls. French Consul Fliehe
was in the fashionable crowd of music-lovers.
The Red Cross finds itself as busy as ever.
Cables from English commissioners ask for
the usual impressive monthly consignments,
including jam and Australian tinned rabbit.
Other items: 10 tons of biscuits (Australian-
made), 24 tons of chocolate, three tons
sweets. (The gassed patient cannot smoke
a “fag,” but finds great relief in sucking a
boiled lolly.) Three million cigarettes are
wanted, also 50 cases of old linen and 10,000
suits of pyjamas. The Egypt Commissioner
plunges on Australian flour and socks —3000
pairs of them.
Alex. Welsh, boss of the Grammar School
at Echucu, indulges himself in writing
hatches of verse. His latest is called “The
Kaiser in Heaven,” and the A.A.A. will have
it on the market before Christmas.
Cavaliere Eles, the handsome and ex-
quisitely-tailored Italian Consul-General, is
going to Hongkong early in the New Year.
The change means promotion.
The wonderful collection of Australian in-
sects gathered in the tropical region of
North Bananaland and New Guinea by F. P.
Dodd, of Kuranda, Bananaland, has been
bought by George 1). Meudell, of Melbourne,
for a syndicate, which proposes to send it to
the United States for exhibition in the big
cities. It has been stated by Australian
entomologists that no insect collection like
this exists in the world, because it is so per-
fect and representative of our insects.
The Catholic Church strikes oil with
queen carnivals. Warragul, in Gippsland,
had panted under a crushing load of debt in
its church; now the whole has been magnifi-
cently wiped off by a queen carnival and
other attractions which raised £lBOO. Arch-
bishop Mannix and Bishop Phelan visited
the final rally in glorious congratulation. The
financial fight between the rival queens was
intense. The winner was crowned by an
“angel.”
Among patriotic workers in Melbourne
there is a growing feeling that it is a pity to
allow peace to put an end to their valuable
and interesting work. One suggestion is
that, when the need of the soldiers ceases,
women should work on for hospitals and so
forth. It’s an idea worth remembering.
Christian Science is powerfully enforced
by Ezra Palmer, from the United States,
at the Auditorium. Money is refused
on the plea. “We want not yours,
hut you.” This is a welcome change
from the churches, which always have the
plate to shove. The Christian Scientists
claim 2,000,000 men and women adherents in
the United States and Britain. In Mel-
bourne they are surprisingly insignificant,
with only a handful of people at the
Athenaeum on Sundays. It’s been the same
for a number of years.


INFLUENZA.
Send for the doctor and go to bed
The Public are warned to take no
chances with the Influenza epidemic
should it make its appearance in Aus-
tralia, but to send for the family doctor
and go to bed. This Influenza plague
has already proved itself deadly in New
Zealand, and It may make Its appearance In Australia any
day in spite of the rigid quarantine regulations. If you have
an attack of the real 1 nfluenza your digestion will be a wreck,
your head, legs and back will ache, your heart action may
be affected, and you will have a temperature. These con-
ditions need the attention of a skilled medical attendant.
It stands every member of the community in hand to so look after their
general health to prevent if possible becoming infected with this deadly
germ, and to accomplish this no better remedy could be taken than Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills. They are a searching, cleansing remedy.
They are mild in their action, but highly effective in cleansing the system
of all impurities and preventing germs getting a chance to incubate.
Petroleum Oils, Salts, Tonics and other so-called remedies are of little
use to cleanse the system and keep these germs in check; in fact they will
have a tendency to aggravate an already deranged gastric condition. It
would also be advisable to take from 5 to 10 grains of ASPIRIN two or
three times daily if feeling out of sorts, or 10 grains of QUININE on
retiring at night the same time as the pills are taken. A common cold can
usually be broken up if either ASPIRIN or QUININE is taken with Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills on the first indication of a cold.
Following these simple precautions may prevent an attack of serious
illness. If you get the real influenza do as already stated: send for the
doctor and go to bed. Don’t try and doctor yourself. The complaint is
too dangerous to take chances with. The doctor may or may not allow
you to continue taking Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. In any case, follow
his directions both with medicine and food, and you will be on the safe side.

The yarn about English thoroughbred
breeders looking on Australian “form” as of no
importance seems to be getting out of repair—
that is, if the money talking at the Newmarket sales
last week is any guide. Amongst the nags on offer
was Officious, the dam of King Offa. Someone
parted with £3SBS for her. For a yearling colt-
from Officious by Steadfast the last bid was £3360.
As a yearling King Offa sold for £2OO. If he had
won the two Cups what would the dam and half-
brother have been worth?
* * * *
The nags beaten by Panacre in the Wal-
lace Mile at Newcastle on Saturday were not the best
in the Commonwealth, but as he carried lost. I3lbr
and won pulling up in 411, the performance suggests
that he may happen to be hard to beat in the Villiers
with 9st. 41b. Panacre did a lot of racing in the
Spring, and didn’t improve on it, and horkes which
train off in November are not very often discovered
doing their best in November. But it happens some-
times, and in spite of Panacre’s inglorious exhibition
in the Epsom Saturday’s gallop is a not-too-bad
recommendation for next week.
Another starter at Newcastle on Saturday that has
been “mentioned” for Villiers was Fight Ever. She
arrived third in the Shorts with Bst. 91b. In the
Villiers she has a stone less, and to win will have to
do a long way better than she did on Saturday or in
the Epsom. In that event, with 7st. 41b., Fight Ever
had every chance at the last furlong. She simply
wouldn’t come on, and there was no more merit about
her position at the finish (fifth) than if it had been
twice as remote. The lady likes six better than
eight. Panacre’s choice appears to be the other way
about.
* * * *
The present indications are that Dame
Acre will start favorite for the Villiers, and, taking
everything into consideration, there seems no reason
why the mare should not be considered likely to pull
it off. In the Epsom she got 21b. and a beating
from Rebus ; also, she got a bad squeeze just before
striking the turn. In the Villiers Rebus has to allow
her 91b., which in a true-run race he couldn’t do.
On her running at Rosehill a couple of week's ago
Dame Acre seemed likely to be as well as ever she
was for Randwick. Whether she can give any weight
at all to Amberdown or whether that champion in
Banannland is not being given too much cargo by
Sydney hanclicappers are matters on which the avail-
able evidence is rather confusing. The probability
is that Amberdown is a better horse than liis Sydney
efforts so far imply. If he is really as good as his
Bananaland exploits suggest, then he ought not to be
excessively annoyed with Bst. 121 b. in the Villiers.
The same idea appears to prevail about another
Bananalander, Sydney Damsel (Bst. lib.), who has
been fairly well backed.
# * * *
The result of frantic squeals by N. S.
Wales country clubs at the lean cut they get off the
totalisator turnover is a measure increasing the
share of these clubs to 5 per cent. In some cases
this will enable clubs to obey the law about running
the machine without suffering loss. In other cases it
will not. In any circumstance the amount on sane
theory of running the machine is hopelessly inade-
quate. The practical result of introducing the total-
isator into N. S. Wales has' been to instal a Govern-
ment revenue-collecting agency on the racecourse.
The purposes for which the machine was asked for
by its advocates have been ignored. The consequence
has been to increase the revenue, to do no good
whatever to racing, and to put a few more pounds
into the already well-inflated pockets of pony-track
shareholders. At the ponies the three-div. system is
tremendously popular. At Rosebery on Saturday
£21,268 was put through. This sent £l4BB into
the public cashbox, gave about £5OO profit to the
club, didn’t increase the racing stakes by a single
shilling nor interfere with the profession of Ike.
With a totalisator run on these lines, which prac-
tically puts the State into partnership with the pro-
prietary club, anyone who has an idea that he could
discover a Government ready to end the scandals
associated with racing might as well put it in the
nearest freezer.

South Australian trainers are worried
about horsemen for Port Adelaide Christmas Handi-
cap and Cup. There is a difficulty in getting lads
to ride at 7st. in S.A., while 6st. 71b. is out of the
question. Few featherweights, scaling as low as
required, have the strength to control a horse,
apart from any ability to get the best out of the
mount, and it looks as if overweight will have to
be declared in most instances, unless the problem
is solved by diminutive lads arriving from other
States. All the lightly-burdened horses will not
run, but the weights indicate that 25 boys under
7st. are wanted for the Christmas Handicap and 24
for the Cup. The majority of these horses (14)
should carry fist. 71b., whereas the list of registered
jockeys does not show one horseman whose riding
weight is 6st. 71b. The minimum weight question
will apparently have to be considered by the S.A.
racing authorities. It ought to be considered by other
racing authorities, too. for it cannot be disputed
that such a weight as fist. 71b. keeps an incalculable
number of scrubbers in training.
* * * *
It transpires that the record of 45fsec.
for half a mile set up by Surveyor in the Electric
Plate at Christchurch, Maoriland, lately, was per-
petrated while a gale wind was raging behind. Be-
ing registered in a decided race the figures, of
course, stand. But they lose some of their point.
Meanwhile owner Stead might make an interesting
discovery if he tried his moke over four furlongs
with' the atmosnhere raging in the other direction.
A convenient place to make research on the influence
of wind on speed might be the track at Trentham
(Wellington). It blows there as a rule so hard
that strange horses, which haven’t got the knack of
turning their toes into the landscape, only find
themselves hitting the earth once in every 10 strides
and, not seeing the joke, become discouraged and
contemplate the finish from astern, to the great dis-
gust of their proprietor. One owner was so dis-
gusted at Trentham a year or so ago on learning
that his animal had been kept off the turf by the
wind all the wav round' that he entered a protest
on the ground that the event was open only to
aeroplanes. The stewards were so disgusted with
his unsportsmanlike action that they forfeited his
deposit. Whereupon he became so indignant that he
gave up racing altogether, and has been a richer
man ever since, in suite of the discovery that the
wind had not been as strong as the arms of the
pilot. But they register some rare times at Tren-
tham though, when there happens to be a real
breeze.

“Trot”: Even taking a continuous film of
the happenings from the pole to the line, suggested
by The Bulletin, wouldn’t be much use in the way
of getting a lialf-Nelson on the unfair rider if
stipes and clubs remained in their present benevo-
lent frame of mind. The penalties inflicted for
departure from dinkum methods of getting round
are so absurdly lenient as to suggest that they ought
to be handed out with apologies. This is particu-
larly the case with well-known riders, and the only
possible conclusion is that the stipes and clubs are
afraid of offending someone by depriving him of the
horse-navigator’s services. As a matter of cold jus-
tice the penalty on the prominent, experienced prac-
titioner should always be greater than upon the
other class of individual, mainly because the former
knows better (or ought to) and because if the
novice sees examples of foul riding by the finished
article he is bound to pay more time qualifying in
crookedness than in anything else. Suspensions for
a month or so for offences which imperil life or are
otherwise incidental to stousliing a runner’s chance
are such a flagrant violation of racing that a month
or two’s holiday seems like a jest. If there was
less hesitation in wiping foul riders out for all time
there would be a mighty big drop on the number of
eases, investigated and otherwise. The yarn that
punishiwent of this sort would be too severe is
obviously a mere gas-screen. No punishment could
be too harsh, for the offence is of the grossest. A
rider’s calling is dangerous enough at any time.
The job of putting a horse at the post fit to run is
often long and tiresome. For the danger to be in-
creased, a trainer’s work to be made futile and
owners and the public robbed by a rascal having no
more sense of responsibility than a rabbit is the
worst sort of possible outrage. Yet it happens time
after time, and is reckoned bad luck if anyone hap-
pens to take notice.
* * * *
“Some Boy” : Clearly enough the “system”
mentioned by “Snipster” (B. 5/12/’18) of passing the
13th horse out as a preliminary to finding the winner
and then discarding every successive 13th until
only three are left, is not a system at all. It is
merely going daft. If there are only 12 nags the
madness obviously is without magic. A real system
works whether there are two runners or 27. All
these schemes of hatching eggs, drawing from a hat
and eating pork sausages as an incitement of dreams
are defective through allowing extraneous influences
to come in and crab the deal. My system of accu-
mulating cash by finding winners or losers is, on
the contrary, absolutely water-tight. All you do is
stick to your money by way of a start. If the horse
you select to win hits the front at the right place,
hand over the stake to the savings bank. If it omits
to arrive, buy war-bonds with what you would have
lost. By this means you get it both ways. Then
at the er.d of a year hold an audit, and if the surplus
on hand is less than would have been in the kit by
putting the wad into Israel, try your own system.
If there is more, then thank me for leading you not
into temptation. And just to encourage you to sys-
tematise things, I’ll lay you 20 to 1 there is more,
and a lot more, too.

The suggestion to invade England with a
Khaki XI next year was made concrete by the Aus-
tralian Board of Control at Sydney last week. The
tour will be from Mav to September, and the fixtures
decided by the Marylebone people and the Board’s
reps, in England. Gordon Campbell (S. Aus.)- —
who has been appointed manager and treasurer—
Eric Barbour (N.S.W.) and R. L. Park (Vic.)
will pick out 15 players for the jaunt, after which the
Board will have a say in choosing the captain. Only
A.I.F. men with over-sea service are eligible. The
team will carry the new label of “The A.I.F. Aus-
tralian XI.” The scheme is one this page doesn’t
think much of. Cricket in Australia is in a fairly
parlous state, and it would-be far better to con-
centrate on getting it on its legs again before
attending to it somewhere else. Arid in any case
cricket is cricket, and an Australian team should be
picked on the cricketing merits of Australian
players.
* * » *
“Bert II.”: The proposal from Maryle-
bone that a team of Australians “who had served”
should tour England is not as untimely as a recent
par. (B. 21/11/’18) suggests. In a charity match
at Lord’s, in August, 1917, an Australian team con-
taining Barbour (capt.), Kelleway, Macartney,
Massie, Matthews and Taylor, defeated a team from
the Navy and Army, which was reckoned fully repre-
sentative by the presence of Warner (capt.), Har-
dihge, Haywood, Jennings, Tvldesley, Hendren,
Fender, Blythe and Lee. The outstanding feature of
a great match was the century made by Barbour.
When he went in four wickets were down for 74.
As another fell immediately, one more failure would
have lost the match, but Barbour, playing slashing
cricket, made 101 in 95 minutes without giving a
chance. It was a masterly display. Kelleway 31,
Taylor 25, and Matthews n.o. 15 proved our boys
to be in great heart. The final scores were: Navy
and Army, 106; Australians, 242. It was probably
this match which prompted the suggestion of a
tour.
* * * *
The Inter-State Cricket Conference at
Sydney last week broke new ground. Henceforth
play begins at 11 o’clock (instead of 12) ; there
will be eight balls to the over; punctuality will
be insisted upon—especially by incoming batsmen.
Also the long-wrangled-over Sheffield Shield is to be
cut out, and the XI with the best record in the
next three years will take the utensil for ever and
ever.
* * * *
A conspicuous feature of Sydney cricket
this vear is the battle between left-handed batsmen
Warren Bardsley (Glebe) and J. Bogle ( larsity).
The end of Saturday’s round left them clear of
other players in both aggregate and average. Bogle s
510 runs, averaging 85.0, place him on top. Bards-
ley *s smites have produced 431 runs at an average
of T 1.83. Bogle has made three centuries (125*.
158*, and 130) ; Bardsley has banged up two (114
and 107). For once in a way the Ma State XI is
certain to be healthy in left-handers.
* * *
R. 11. B. Bettington (King’s School),
who has been drafted into the N. S. W ales’ crowd
to practise for inter-State cricket this month, made
a brilliant 99 in the Sydney ’Varsity v. Combined
Schools fixture last week. His wicket fell when the
score-book showed 2 for 197. W. F. Brown (capt.)
made 60, with the book showing 3 for 231. lhe
balance went quickly, and the total \Vas 300.
’Varsity crumbled before the Schools’ assault for
195, and the latter had a win by 105. The success
of Bettington and Brown (who, by-the-way, are
captains of King’s School and Newington College)
is viewed without resentment by the selection com-
mittee, who were game enough to give them a
chance before Grade-players of getting into the
State XI. When last measured Bettington was only
6ft. 3in. long.
* * * *
The smacking of centuries in Sydney
Grade cricket has this year become a vice. To last
week-end the total was 15 in five rounds, which is
easily the biggest tally for many seasons. All of
which is a reminder for trundlers to do some prac-
tice. The decision of the inter-State Cricket Con-
ference to play out all matches between the States
suggests that cricket is likely to be spread over
more days than will do the pastime much good
unless some bowlers with a punch are discovered.
An effort quite out of the ordinary on Saturday
was 11. B. Kellett’s (Gordon) 6 for 24 against
Waverley. Kellett is a new-comer this year in
first-grade cricket. So far he has taken 10 wickets
for 115.
* * * *
Clem Hill is one of the S. Australian
superVisers of men selected to practise for the inter-
state match with Vic. on New Year’s Bay in Mel-
bourne. it is thought he will be in the finally-
selected team. Hill making runs is a big draw to
the cricket-loving public of the Eastern States, and
everyone will be pleased to see him in the eleven.
However, he has not played in any A-grade matches
this season. His duties as stipendiary steward takes
up his time on race days, and the excitement of
bowls has been claiming him on off-Saturdays.
* * * *
W. J. Whitty, the international left-arm
bowler (who, by-the-way, was one of Clem Hill’s
finds), made a re-appearance in the match Glenelg
v. Adelaide the other Saturday. He appears to
have his old-time sting, and as the State has very
few effective trundlers Whitty’s deliveries are wanted
to strengthen the offensive. The selectors did not
previously know his whereabouts; anyway, his
name is not mentioned among the 23 picked for
practice.
* * * *
“J.Q.” : It seems a good thing that
“Adelovl” (B. 5/12/’18), who wants to limit- the
time of each team’s innings to three or four hours, is
not Billy Hughes. For his dwn sake he ought to be
glad. To put a time-limit on cricket is to degrade
the game; to make it into a thing too much
dependent on luck and calculations, too little depend-
ent on skill and dexterity with bat and ball, and to
turn the batsmen iifto wild sloggers. That kind of
play, though the sort of thing to revive the crowd’s
interest, is not good cricket. When one caters for
the crowd he usually has to defile his caterings, for
the crowd likes the bad in most things. The love of
wild and sensational smacking is equivalent to the
vulgar delight in newspaper accounts of murders and
divorces, social gossip and cock-fighting. The stone-
waller is by far a greater asset to his side than the
player who tries to amass runs quickly, for he tires
and annoys the bowler, is consistent, comes out with
best average in the long run, and will often hold up
his wicket at a critical time so that a brilliant bats-
man like Trumper can amass runs. The fast run-
getter is inconsistent, and has 0 put after his name
20 times more often than 50. The game certainly
needs shortening, but it can be done without any
detriment to it, so let us prune a little off its tail
instead of mutilating the body. What about cutting
out the second innings?
To the foregoing this page submits the comment-
ary that objection'to placing a time-limit on a game
and advocacy of shortening the proceedings amounts
to the same thing, except perhaps in matters of
detail. Anyway, it is sheer nonsense to burble
about admiration of smart scoring being a manifesta-
tion of base tastes, “equivalent to delight in news-
paper accounts of murders and divorces.” Just as
reasonable would be an accusation that approval of
bright tennis or football or of speed in a runner
is on the same plane of moral degradation as the
absorption of joy from the records of German brutal-
ities in Belgium. To say that a batsman such as
Trumper was should be regarded as of less import-
ance than some stolid blocker who dug himself into
the crease for hours and filled crowd and players alike
with a wild yearning to witness his assassination
sounds mighty like trying experiments with a leg-
pull. The unchallengeable fact is that of recent
years cricket had been growing increasingly dull as
a game and as a spectacle. The public generally
hau been getting tired of it. The writer thinks
that this is a pity, for cricket is a very fine game,
and in more ways than one. But there would be
still greater pitifulness incidental to allowing the
mildew to accumulate without making an attempt
to brush it away. A conservative attitude towards
the rules of sport and athletics is up to a point
easily justifiable, but beyond that point conservatism
merely means the protection of rottenness. Trench
cricket is no good to anyone, and when a game
ceases to be worth watching the kids soon begin to
like something else better.
* * * *
Talking about the revival of bash. Pro-
bably it will not be delayed very long. One result
of the enrolment of vast numbers of youthful
athletes in armies has been to (1) popularise boxing
as a sport among an enormous crowd who in ordi-
nary circumstances would never have known what a
glove felt like, (2) to develop a heap of latent
talent, and (3) to inspire in many manly breasts
ideas about going on with already created rivalries
and new ambitions. Of course there will be a lot
of sorting out In British and American regiments
and naval outfits there are hundreds of youngsters
who look like the material for making champions
out of Thev have had good material to practise
on. They have led healthy, vigorous lives. They
have had the best of instruction—the Americans
particularly. Within a year there will be a whole
crop of newcomem and many violent disturbances
pending. Most likely the old-tuners will pass out
with great rapidity. A lot of hem are very old-
timers, too This is the case among the
heavies and middle-weights. The war-training ought^
to give the world among other things a genuine
heavyweight champ., a commodity that has been
nl } ss j ng f or quite a while,
, , ‘ ’ ... . .
Meantime the older crowd are not waiting to get
older before missing the ’bus. Georges Carpentier,
the French specialist, has already received diplo-
matic inquiries about having a go from a dozen or
more—among them Australia’s old friend McGoorty.
A match with Carpentier would naturally he good
business, for in the circumstances of the hour the
gate might easily be somewhere in the neighbor-
hood of a record. But Georges cannot expect to
stay on much longer. He is 25, has had four
years’ war service, and been wounded. It is un-
likely that he has kept" his speed and condition,
and if these once go they are mighty hard to re-
cover at that age. McGoorty is 30 and was done

The brilliant Keith Kirkland (North

\y a i es combined high schools senior swimming
championship events, one hot afternoon lasl week,
and gathered in the 50yds. (20see.), 100yds. (62sec.)
and 440yds. (Cmin. 9Ascc.). These earned him the
]f c iran Memorial medal. Last year Kirkland, in an
( .ff ol -t to clean up the programme at a similar meet-
jng, was first in the 50yds., 100yds., 220yds., and
seeond a f 440yds. and 880yds. A couple of weeks

“Trigger”: When I learned to use arlil-
]ery wt . didn’t bother about the implement which
CO uld lean most shots against a single kerosene-tin
ab 50 yards or any other distance: Dad always tried
q, e ordnance on six tins each a yard apart, and if the
munitions failed to perforate each target the outfit
V vas passed to the junk-heap. The reason is that the
main objective was sparrow. It. was over in Canter-
bury (Maorilaiid) when the imported grain-swallower
first came under suspicion of being a pest. As wheat
only brought 2s. 6d. a bushel in those days, and you
could get 3d. a dozen for heads, the wide working
gun had to earn its keep 111 two l ®
pretty Rood hand with the weapon, but old Sandy
McSnougall in the next farm was better. Sandy,
using, 4°'Shot charges, onljf once missetl annexing
J pfiS than 20 at one explosion. Bie (lay he did 19
he reckoned the game . “P;i , aB LH”;
»*££*s* ’SLf’bl.™
but I know that I often got 12 dozen sparrows with
six shots. There was a knack in it—getting the birds
m ec ; te ; on f r om behind and raking them aft and fore-
mosj. g 0 0 s p ea l c . The gun cost ohly 475. 6d.
*
“Bung”: You can reckon that anyone who
blithers about fancy shots with the rifle being
matters of flukes never knew Tom, a Shoalhaven
Galley fur-hunter of the ’nineties. Tom used a short
g n j der with an expansive bullet for bear-shooting,
b ut he never spoilt a skin by boring holes through
it Hjs method was to pelt' the bear out on £b a
h rane h, and then with a quick shot amputate the
supporting limb. The dogs below kept the bear busy
tin Tom . arrived. I have seen Tom and his son
F red repeat this performance many times throughout
a day > s hunting. The trees down the Shoalhaven
were fairly elongated, too.

They usually are up to date, but our stock re-

previous period.
The impossibility of importing has probably
been a spur to effort, necessity being the mother
of invention.
Anyway, they “have got there.”
What about prices, though?
Well, we make the brooches, and so are in a
position to know that they are rare values.
Values greater than you can get in England.
Values larger than in previous times, because

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character ) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Petrol: Can’t say; but if you run over
and kill a child (or anybody) with your car, you’ll
find it very inconvenient. You will have to spend
half an hour or so kicking your heels at the court
until you are called to state that deceased deliber-
ately walked under the wheels... .E.A.H.: No, it did
not appear in The Bulletin .... Amos Keta: For all
you know to the contrary, we may get it yet. There’s
a precarious lot to do, you know—or you would
know, if you had the average size in intelligence
K.R.F.: “Weary Bay” not quite up....N.P.: Doesn’t
carry 0n.... 8.M.8.: Nothing in it. ...C.D.: Starts
well, but wants a crisper finish... .L.P.J.: “The Lost
Souls” fails in craftsmanship... .D.A.P.: N 0....
J.11.H.: Doesn’t seem to get anywhere. Anywhere is
an indefinite place at best... .H. 8.: “Fairy-led” is led
off the premises.. .A.K.N.: Send stamps for return if
you want copy back... .P.A.C.: Reads like a loan
politician going to the repentance-5t001... .J.,1.J.:
Those gum-trees dancing with a steam-roller attached
to each foot seem dubious... .Plevna: Metre all wrong.
. ...J.M.8.: Very p00r... . A.M.D.: No use sending
us stuff like that. Verse, prose and lunacy are dis-
tinct .... Facetus: Feeble.... Bortelli: Have a look
at it:—>
Then there are those who bless you when departing
And welcome you when you return once more.
Who take your gifts, your hopes with scarce a
murmur,
But ne’er return, although your heart be sore,
These, too, are friends —yea, friends; as barren
shores.
....Douglas Recks: Reply was to H.R.V. The
sonnet is no g00d... .E.M.1.: Not enough in it....
The Mug: No interest Hugh Kalyptus: Too many
words about nothing. Nothing is a subject that
doesn’t call for many words.... Sandringham: Com-
monplace. .. . Archangel: Too du11.... F. V.K.: Fairly
constructed verse, but without freshness or interest.
. ...R.A.: Hash-up of dead ideas... .W.E.P.: Your
problem isn’t well enough stated... .O.B.: Best to
date:—>
May these heroes of the Australian Star,
Live in memory for ever near and far ;
That it will be a guide like the glowing mar,
In memory of home of Ma and Pa.
In memory of the Anzac the heroes we cherish,
Glad to see them return again and flourish ;
To see them in health and never perish,
Never to go through again anything so hellish.
....Spectrum: Not for print. .. . A.H.P.: Rather late
for the submarine campaign... .M.F.D.: Too thin.
. ...N.P.: “Comedy of Commerce” has no interest.
... . J.C.8.: That’s not the way to tell a yarn....
R.H.: “Mekeo” too long for interest. ... E.J.G.: Not
for us S.G.W.: Don’t like it... .F.V.C.: “No
Man’s Land” is useless.... Frosty: Plain facts end-
ing in a pious wish in a stanza that falls to pieces
don’t exactly make a poem. (This isn’t exactly
what we mean, but you have more time than we have
to think it 0ut.)... .M.D.: You show skill ; now
get something definite to say M.R.: Not up
M. McE.: “Cry of the Wanderer” has no merit....
R.S.: “Mum” and “Stiffen Up” badly done. You’ll
have to take some pains... .Wireless: Give the war
a rest N.H.R.: Not nearly up D.P.M.: Misses
by a long way C.H.S.: No R.L.A.: Try an
ice-pack or an iceberg, or something... .J.K.: That
point has been made in the paper—hard.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
H.W.A.: It must be about two years old. That's
too old for that kind of joke... Rod: Strive for more
freedom.... Cresol: Artistically you’re just learn-
ing to spell. Refuse to base any prophecies on it.
J.T.: So many labels on your drawing that it
is practically reading matter... .Jean M.: Apply
again in five years, or forget the address of this
office. .. .V.C.V.: You’re a long way off yet....
B. C. T. Gray: Posting drawings back. The boy
has some artistic ability but requires tuition....
Jim M.: Sorry F.G.: Carried to the office
tomb. No flowers.... Rup : Worse than the influ-
enza. .. .A. J.H.: Our opinion is that you drew if in
the dark with the landlord breathing threats through
the keyhole. It has the look of a thing accom-
plished in a moment of frenzy... .W.D.: Flat as
Watt’s plea for Hughes’s censor... .Bon: The police-
man has one foot in the foreground and one in the
middle distance. His uniform doesn’t fit him and
his helmet was made by his wife from a pattern
in New York Life. . . .Hope C.: It hesitates.
In S. Australia the minimum wage for
adult males has been fixed at 10s. 6d. per
day, and the Government’s attitude is that
it won’t pay so much —in fact, that it can’t.
S.A. is a place practically devoid .of gold
and coal. It hasn’t a river worth the name
to call its own ; 84 per cent, of its area has
less than lOin. of annual rainfall; and out
of 190,500 square miles in the Common-
wealth with 40in. of rain per annum its
share is just 64 square miles. Also, it has
the second biggest debt per head in Aus-
tralia. Still it hasn’t yet applied for Fede-
ral “relief,” like two of its neighbors. The
payment of £500,000 a year in extra wages
to State servants under the award is said
to be impossible, but many impossible things
are liable to happen nowadays. In fact,
this country is the Home for Impossibles.
“Chasuble”: The habitual snuffle-busting
of the Lutheran preachers in Germany has
been astounding. Take a couple of examples
from sermons delivered only a few weeks
before the crash. Rev. Dr. Dryander, Chief
Court preacher, said, in Berlin Cathedral:
“As I look back into the past, and see
nations passing through the fires of affliction,
I perceive no examples of fortitude, lofty and
enduring courage and firm reliance on the
Divine will to compare with ours. My eyes
fill with tears of gratitude to the Almighty
that he has called me into a nation superior
to all others in every quality of the Christian
life. In our inmost hearts we say, ‘Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they
do.’ ” Rev. Dr. Conrad, of the Kaiser Wil-
helm Memorial Church, Berlin, said: “We
fight for the Christian ideals of righteous-
ness and freedom for the oppressed. God
does not forgive those who do not implore
His forgiveness, neither does Germany.
When the sinning nations come to us be-
seeching forgiveness and pardon, we shall
not refuse.” And then Foch went and bust
the show up. Wonder what those holy
squibs are saying now?

RRIT4 BILITY
Irritability, like Headache, is indisputable evidence of some disorder of
the body—generally of the nervous system. In the majority of cases this
condition of the nervous system arises from either Indigestion or Constipation.
Tonics and other treatment will be of little value unless the cause is
removed. Relieve the indigestion, stimulate the bowels to a regular natural
habit and all symptoms of irritability will disappear.
To accomplish this take a course of Chamberlain s Tablets—they have a
marvellous effect on the stomach, liver and bowels and relieve all disorders
of those organs.
Try them next time you feel irritable.
To stimulate the digestive organs, cleanse and invigorate the stomach,
and induce a natural, regular habit of the bowels, nothing equals

jbr the Stomach & Liver .
Diarrhoea.
•Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
fatal to young and old. The great danger in
this disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
lain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual looseness of the bowels will
save suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
ime and money.
Take It With You.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy wdh
them is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges ti e stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in use for these ailments, care should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
bowel trouble nearly always come on suddenly
and when ‘his remedy is at hand all danger
may be avoided.
Be Firm.
When you ask for a bottle of Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is nothing so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dysentery and diarrhoea,
and has never been known to fail. ‘ Can be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. It
l ever fails to give immediate and permanent
relief.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Holidays and Health,
The object of a holiday is usually to gain
renewed energy for another year’s work. A
difficulty is that holidays are generally not
sufficiently long to accomplish their pur-
pose. Jaded people go away for a fortnight
when they need a month or six weeks. \ ery
often a holiday becomes a round of sight-
seeing that is as wearying as work, and the
holiday-maker returns as unfit as w T hen he
went away.
If possible the holday should be started
in reasonable health, and if you are feeling
tired, weary and limp, as most people do in
our Australian summers, when the blood be-
comes thin and impoverished, you should not
wait for your holidays, but begin now to build
up your blood with a true tonic, in-
vigorate and refresh your system. Nothing
is more valuable for this purpose than Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills. Over and over again
they have been proved to be as good as a
holiday to jaded men and women. If you
cannot take a holiday, the value of Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills is even greater, for
they make good the caused by illness
and the wear and tear of life. Any dealer
can supply you with Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. . , ,

Back on the Tracks.
“N.A.” : The promoters of the One Big
Union movement have overlooked one of the
lessons of the past. In one of the propa-
ganda pamphlets issued by J. S. Garden,
secretary of the 0.8. U. in A. S. '' ales,
occurs the following
Industrial unionism prepares the way for, and lays
the sure foundation of, the Socialist Republic.
Under the new economic regime the central authority
will be a Parliament of Industry, composed 01 repie-
sentatives of the various departments of production,
and will be elected from below. It is the historic
work of the Industrial Union of the working class
to rear that Parliament of Industry.
Following on the .capitulation of the union-
ists after the Maritime Strike of 1890, the
Labor Defence Committee, m its official
report, included a piece of horse-sense it had
learnt during the disastrous industrial up-
heaval , . , , .
An important lesson learnt in the hour of defeat
is that while we must go on ever increasing out
capacity for fighting, as we have fought before, the
time has come when trades-unionists must use the
Parliamentary machinery that has, in the past, used
them .. . The trumpet notes at which the barrier
will fall are essentially political.... We must set
about tlie work of reform where it seems that refoim
alone can be obtained—and that is Parliament.
The outcome of the ’9O strike was the
formation of the Electoral Labor League
(now Australian Labor Party) and the
consequent long list of legislative gains
from the presence of the party in the
Legislative Assembly. It is safe to say that
if the shovers of the 0.8. U. had put
a deal more enthusiasm and exertion
into the Federal elections of 1917—-
when the Labor campaign was notoriously
sluggish—the result might have been dif-
ferent. Their game appeared to be rather
to sicken the worker of the existing political
machine, and so pave the way for their own
patent juggernaut.
♦
C. J. Ziebell, the Fitzroy (Vic.) chemist
who suicided lately, was oue of the sights
of Melbourne’s Block in pre-war days. With
a smart "Homburg hat tilted to port on his
thick curly hair, and his obtrusive chest
stuck out to match the pride of his bellig-
erent moustache, he was a case of over-
weening Frightfulness long before Aus-
lians fully understood the term. Occasion-
ally he accentuated his physical opulence
by wearing white trousers and lurid yellow
boots, and in the height of his self-adver-
tisement he brushed up his mo. in imita-
tion of the Kaiser. Though he was pub-
licly impeccable in his sentiments about the
war, he was German enough to feel bad
when his countrymen caved in. It is alleged
that it was actually the defeat of the Huns
that induced him to second the motion of
the late Ilerr Ballin. i
‘•Sawbones, Junior”: The domestic gas-
stove is alleged by a Melbourne doctor to
be one of the many agents for the propaga-
tion of the influenza-coccus. The explanation
is not obvious to most, but it is simple
enough. Medical men urgently advise those
seeking to avoid the plague, instead of just
letting Nature take its easy, sneezy course,
to respire as fully and freely as possible.
The “deep breather,” who has worked his
midriff into suppleness by beginning each
breathing movement as low down as pos-
sible and finishing it as high up as pos-
sible, has a much better chance of escaping
influenza than the person who just takes air
in without thinking about how he takes it;
and the housewife who spends much time
near a gas-stove is still worse off than the
latter, because the fumes she inhales have
an enervating effect on her breathing-works,
and make them less able to deal with in-
truding germs. The old wood-fire, which is
such a bother to the average cook-wife, is
far and away more healthy than the drud-
gery-abolishing gas-fixture.
A few words from The Bulletin’s chief
Hun-hater: —
Linked together by a common hatred of the com-
mon hog—and no commoner hog ever existed —races
that were far apart have met and become acquainted.
The sentiment should be preserved, otherwise we
may lose that acquaintanceship and drop back into
our old isolation. Although the Australian is a good
deal of a traveller and something of a world-
adventurer, he had already, before the war, devel-
oped a tendency to be self-satisfied and self-centred.
To some extent he has got over this unfortunate
mental attitude, and I trust the new sentiment of
friendship will be preserved. It is not necessary
to lower our tariff or abandon our ambition to
keep Australia white —these are mere details of in-
ternal policy. Apart from them there is a com-
munity of brotherly hatred which must not be
allowed to die out. Our people have discovered
that the Serb and the Montenegrin—folk whom we
only knew in books —are our kinsfolk, willing to
share their rations and their cigarettes with us
and to die with us so long as we are plugging the
Ilun together and climbing over his mangled re-
mains—the more mangled the better —to plug
another lot of Huns. The Arab proved to be more
of a friend than we thought, and not so brown as
he looked. The Bohemian —commonly called for
war purposes a Czecho-Slovak —isn't simply an
untidy person who drinks beer in a club, and owes
money, and has two wives, and hangs on to the
outer fringe of literature or art. He is a proud
upstanding man with a country of his own, and
is willing to shove his bayonet further into a Hun
than the best Australian —or at least make an
attempt at it. We have even discovered that the
Brazilian and the Portuguese have something in
common with us, while the Belgian and the Boer
are members of our own family. Hatred of the
Hun should be taught in schools and in churches,
and there should be a Chair of Hun-hating in
every University, and the vivisection of Huns
, -honld he included in every surgical course, and
the mysterious disappearance of Huns and Hun
sympathisers should be part of a legal training and
a feature of instruction to young policemen, detec-
tives and members of Orange lodges, Masonic bodies
and Hibernian societies. This should be done to
keep the new brotherhood of man in good going
order. A link has been forged to bind together
widely separated peoples, and if the link holds
we will be nearer to the moral and spiritual Feder-
ation of the world than we ever were before. The
League of Brotherly Hatred is the one tangible asset
which we have rescued out of the war, and it is an
asset beyond price. Those people who want to
break up the League are enemies of mankind, and
much worse than those who propose to repudiate
the public debt.

Queen of Youth.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A WHITE queen lay in my arm- to
sleep
All the night, all the night;
And her face was a harvest-field to reap
Of kisses light.
Her breath was like the honey robbed
Frotn hawthorn hedges warm in May ,
And her heart against my own heart throbbed
The hours away.
She was the queen of all the world,
The crown of youth was on her head ;
Afid round its gold the soft hair curled
On a golden bed.
The pillows were of lacy thought,
The sheets were broidered lily white
With seven wise dreams the ages wrought
For God’s'delight.
And all her kingdom softly turned
Below the moon from dew to dew
Till merrily the love-star burned
In morning blue.
She rules all ships that sail the sea,
And all the fish that swim the brook;
For she has set them all for me
In a golden book.
All trees are hers on all round hills
And all the meadows white with flowers;
For ever them her music spills
In all good hours.
And hers are all the gems that shine
And homage true of all good men ;
For she won them with a fancy fine
Qf a singing pen.
What would she with her kingdom wide
And the treasure-house of her mind !
Oh, she went far by the daisy-slide
True love to find.
She set a kiss on my singing lip
And the good look on my face;
And she took me away in a silver ship
To a holy place.
And all the night she lay in sleep
With her heart that beat to mine—
Oh. her face was a harvest-field to reap
Of kisses fine!

DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Thursday Night at
Mrs. Bauman’s.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
-TVTUMBER . Nine was keeping holiday in
that room where Mrs. Bauman “re-
-1 ceived.” The ladies of the estab-
lishment, each, save one. with her gentleman
friend—the exception being Mildred, of the
black hair and the hawk eyes and the nose
curved like a hawk’s beak—had met for the
“social” of the week. There was Alice, a
short, plain, fat, fair, white-faced, green-
eyed woman of thirty, her Titian red hair
let down that she might sit on it —which is
advertisement by concealment —and her
“boy,” a beetle-browed ruffian of tremendous
sentimentality. There were Jessie, a thin,
fair-haired woman, who exaggerated her
attenuation by her fashionable skirt; and
the weedy red-haired cigarette consumer
who “protected” her. There were three
superannuated ladies whose friends were
very quiet and very respectful—old thieves
with the demeanor of old workmen. And
there was Mrs. Bauman herself, a weirdly,
horribly fat woman.
The gas flared noisily, for here were no
nice nerves nor delicate susceptibilities. The
garish light shone on the Japanese “blind” at
the doorway—one of those atrocities _ of
colored reeds hanging oh strings and blinding
nobodv in the passage to any detail of the
room j on the dusty applique hanging fas-
tened \ aWry with brass-headed tacks to the
mantel-shelf; on the little overmantel with
its fly-specked, terra-cotta, over-fed infant
on the right bracket and a china clay insult
called! by Mrs. Bauman a “vause” on the
left; with a crockery-ware spaniel immedi-
ately below it, and in the centre a dried blow
iish and a broken nautilus-shell. To the right
of these was a wreath of ancient and imi-
tation orange-blossom of .the year 1878.
From all of which even Sherlock Holmes
must deduce a mariner and a wedding. A
portrait-frame above the overmantel, covered
with coarse yellow gauze, held the portrait
of the mariner—a fierce gentleman with a
monkey shave and the expression of one
who had, for a living, booted many sailors
through interminable voyages. The mariner
had been the husband of Mrs. Bauman. The
occasional glances of melancholy proprietor-
ship she gave to the photograph in the yel-
low gauze showed that the mariner had de-
parted on that voyage which any mariner
can clear for without papers.
Mrs. Bauman had been a lavish hostess that
Thursday. Mildred, alias Mary Ann, had
become tearfully reminiscent of her husband,
recognising his virtues because of the defec-
tion of her lover. The same malted influ-
ence had given Alice more than her usually
great allowance of vanity regarding her hair.
She smoked a mangled cigarette and regarded
her burning mar? with fatuous affection.
And Jessie and all the attendant ruffians
were beginning to wish to be always respect-
able —a condition that showed how far the
beer had penetrated. Snud Wilkins, the
beetle-browed “protector’' of Alice, refilled
his glass and sat back to be comfortably
miserable.
“Sing that song, Al,” he pleaded. “Go on.
Sing that song about tfi-vorced.”
The red-haired cantatriee rose affectedly,
shook out her hair and admired its beauty
in the gaslight. She gave him the half-
smoked cigarette, saying, “Keep me fag
goin’, then,” and he puffed at it, just suffi-
ciently to keep it alight.
With her hands clasped before her and
looking steadfastly at the photograph of the
deceased mariner she sang four maudlin
verses with a voice such as is the mother ot
all cats upon roofs in moonlight. The ruffian
who kept the fag alight moved about un-
easily in his chair as one suffering toothache
and unable to sit still. It was at the fourth
repeated chorus :
“ ‘Although I am die-vovst
Doan take me childerin frommy: > n
I alwis wus a muthair to me owen.
that he interrupted her with snivelling and
broken words.
“Fer Gawd's sayak, A 1; don’t sing them
there kinder songs no more. Y’ know they
alwis makes me cry.”
She took the cigarette from him and
smoked on, saying as she reseated herself.
“You arst me, Mister Man. Am tmy fault 1
kip make people cry. ’ ,
Mrs. Bauman broke in upon the woe.
“Don’ cry, Spud. We know it’s your good
’eart. ’Ave some more beer.'’
And Spud, recognising this panacea for all
woes, wiped his eyes and tilled his glass
was at that moment that a steady
knocking sounded on the front door that
door which opened to all —universally hospit-
able as any other disreputable harpy.
“Don’t let ’em in,” said Mrs. Bauman to
the superannuated lady who rose to answer
the summons. “Tell ’em it’s a social.’
They listened to the janitress withdrawing
the bolt and turning the key. They heard her
say, “Y’ can’t come inter night—it’s a social.
They ‘heard a big rich voice, too slightly
roughened by alcohol for their dulled ears to
notice it, replying: “We’re Socialists, too.
We’re social with everybody.”
Followed a feeble remonstrance, and the
citadel was won. The three invaders stamped
along the passage laughing at the old
woman’s objections, and entered-the hot room
where the gaslight flared on Mrs. Bauman’s
At Home. They stood by the door for a
moment to accustom their eyes to the heat
haze of the gas-jets. Then the rich-voiced
man, hat in hand, advanced to Mrs. Bau-
man. His liquor had already pushed him
into the quotation stage of drunkenness.
“Madam,” he said, “you see before you
three princes—kings, I may say-—of the Arts.
Here,” he said, shoulder-tapping the thin, fair,
boyish man, who laughed at everything and
without ceasing—“is the artist —call him
George. Here,” and lie indicated the third
man, who might have been the artist’s bro-
ther thickened a little—“is Bill, the journal-
ist —the author who will write things to
make you cry or (more rarely) to laugh. And
here am I, Peter the mummer. You have a
social. We are Socialists, and we join you,
with or without your permission, but always
for your own good.”
“It’s a privit ’ouse,” objected Mrs. Bau-
man.
“I’ll deal with ’em, if y’ like, Missus,” said
the sentimental ruffian.
“My friends,” said Peter the actor, as if
he had not heard the sentimentalist, “I see
that this is not a private house. It is the
hotel of all the world, and as such it is here
we abide. I see by me a fair wench in
flame-colored taffeta” ——
“Mind y’r bus’ness,” replied x\lice of the
burning hair. “Spud ’ull take t’ yer if ver
give me any o’ y’r lip.”
“Me oath, I will,” growled the sentimen-
talist.
“Better get out of this, old man,” said the
artist. “They’re a bad lot.”
“I tell you, my lord fool,” retorted the
actor, “that out of this nettle danger we
pluck the flower safety,”
“Y’r a mishiner,” said Mildred, alias Mary
Ann. “We don’t want no truck with mishi-
ners.”
“I am not, fair lady. An’ I have not for-
gotten what the inside of a church is like. I
am a pepper-corn and a brewer’s- horse.”
“I know now,” said Jessie. “He ain’t a
mishiner; he’s a actor. I see him act. He’s
all right; he’s one of us.”
“Peace, good pint-pot! Peace, good tickle-
brain,” the actor said, by such words almost
undoing the introduction and guarantee. “I
would speak with the Queen-Mother.”
“Will I ’it ’im on the point?” demanded the
sentimentalist fiercely. “Will I?”
“Hold yer mouth or out yer go,” said Mrs.
Bauman, placated by her new title. “I’ll
speak to the gen’l’men.”
“Orright! Orright!” said the sentimental-
ist, “I’ll go then, and take A 1 with me.”
“Will yer.'” said that lady. “Not me.”
“Prithee, good varlet, leave,” said the
actor, his face within easy striking distance
of that fist which had helped the sentimental
ruffian through many a garrotting.
“Thou art a knave —a rascal, an eater
of broken meats —a base, proud, shal-
low, beggarly, three-suited hundred pound,
filthy, worsted-stocking, knave —a lily-livered,
action-taking, glass-gazing, super-serviceable,
finical rogue.”
The humorous determined eyes of the tall
slight man looked into tfie uncertain glance
of the ruffian who lived by certain sand-bag-
ging and possible sudden death. The sand-
bagger’s gaze wavered, and the actor con-
tinued.
At that the ruffian broke away.
“Orright; orright. I’ll get. Don’t get
goin’. I carn’t stand bein’ got on to.”
And he went.
The three visitors were in a mischievous
mood, and the journalist remarked causti-
cally :
“Her voice was ever soft, gentle and low-
an excellent thing in woman.”
“ 'E alwus said I ’ad a nice voice,” said
Mrs. Bauman tearfully pointing to the
photograph of the departed mariner above
the stale orange-blossoms and the dried blow-
fish. “I useter sing ‘Father, dear father,
come ’ome to me now, the clock in the steepul
strikes one.’ He loved me volt's he did.”
“Vanity,” remarked the artist as if to him-
self. “Vanity that dies a month after death.”
Mrs. Bauman did not hear him. She
cared for none but that marvellous man, the
actor, who had driven the hardest case in
Collingwood to cover with quotations; and
she continued, still regarding the photograph
of the morose deceased with the chin
whiskers.
“ ’E’s dead now, but ’e give me that there
blow-fish and the naughty-shell. An’ them
was the osange-blorroms.”

“Osange-blorroms.” commented the actor.
"Osange-blorroms ! Ay di me! Toute suite.”
‘‘Loved me, he did,” repeated Mrs. Bau-
man, fiercely. “Loved me ’orrible —though
we was always fightin’ an’ rowin’ w’en 'e
was ashore.', But even if ’e did belt me ’e
loved me—an’ me ’eart’s broke. Oh ! Oh!
Me ’eart’s broke !”
“Oh, for the blow of a banished hand and
the sound of. a voice that was shrill,” said
the journalist, and for the sake of interrup-
tion she turned on him.
“Dicken to you! Leave me ’ouse —it’s as
true’s I live.”
To which the actor: “You swear like a
comfit-maker’s wife. You do not live; you
die daily in your sin.”
At that Alice, distraught with malt and
the loss of the sentimental ruffian, cried with
a voice half full of tears :
“Never mind; me sin. I been virches
’undereds o’ times.”
But the actbr; so stuffed with quotations
that few developments could make an
impasse , replied:
“VirtueV A fig! ’Tis in ourselves that
we are thus or thus.”
Mildred, alias Mary Ann, seconded him.
“That’s right—it’s wliat yer do! It’s what
yer do!”
“What you shall d 6 now,” said the artist,
“is to bring us a jdrinif.”
“Champyne wineV” asked Mrs. Bauman
and answered herself the interrogation. “It’s
all we got. Beeyootiful it is—beeyootiful.”
Under its acid influence the iadies felt
all the sick exhilaration that comes of sher-
bet, or that other accursed drink of Con-
stantinople. kali ; but the three seasoned
drinkers found its disadvantages immedi-
ately.
“By this light flesh and corrupt blood,”
said the, actor, placing one hand on the head
of Mildred, alius Mary Ann, and one upon
the head of Alice (as Slmkspeare made Fal-
staff say and do of Poll Tearsheet), “I swear
l will drink no more of this aerated goose-
berry wine, yclept champagne. I will par-
take of honest colonial beer, though yet we
pay seven-and-six the bottle to this swollen
she-pirate before avc walk the plank.”
The swollen she-pirate waived the insult in
view of a profit of 1.400 per cent, on the
honest colonial, and directed the bringing of
the liquor. But the short, ugly, Titian-haired
woman moved impatiently from the actor’s
hand, saying; “K’jrnpt blood yerself— what*
cher givin’ usV”
He looked at her then—and saw her plainly
though his eyes were dimmed by his by-
drinkings. Her hair, unbound, fell to her
waist and mercifully hid its shapelessness.
Thick as it was glossy, it covered up her
shoulders and obscured the vulgarity of her
face.
The actor put his hand on her head again
and said, with reverence for the words and
in scorn of her, “ ‘For the glory of a woman
is her hair.’ ”
She purred to the flattery and her head
sank against bis knee.
“Did yer make that outer y’r own ’ead?”
asked the she-pirate.
“I ? Peace, good pintpot—•peace, good
tickle-brain. That is from the Epistle of
Paul to the Corinthians.”
“‘The glory of er woman’s erair,’” said
the glorified one.
“That ain’t it,” objected the she-pirate.
“It ain’t the words; —it's the way y’r said it.
What’s the Krintliians? Is that Shak*
speareV”
“It is not Slmkspeare. It is the Bible,”
replied the actor.
A great idea smote the stout she-pirate.
“Will y’ read us soinethink. 1 got a Bible
here. Mag. get the Bible. It’s under the
couch. Y’ know, proppin’ up the leg since
the Army capt’in broke the castor.”
Ancient Mag took the great Bible —one of
the fat family sort —from under the shortened
leg, and the couch immediately sank to star-
board and astern. She brought it to the
actor; and he took a great drink of beer and
opened the Book.
“Bead about ‘the glory of erair,’ ” said the
short woman, making the burnished copper
of her tresses cover her the more—spreading
if for admiration as the peacock slioavs his
tail.
“Don’t say ‘erair,’ good Doll —it hurts me.
Now, a moment—and here’s the place vve
find by accident.”
He had opened the Book, half in earnest —
half in jest; and chance caused the opening
at the thirteenth chapter of the Epistle of
St. Paul to the Corinthians. 11 is eye rested
on the first verse and the artist awoke in
him. He read AAuth all its A’alue gh r en to
every word until the spirit of it entered into
him. and then he read as one inspired:—
“ ‘Though I speak with the tongues of men and of
angels ; and have not charity, I am become but as
sounding in-ass or a tinkling cymbal.’ ”
“Beeyootiful,” said Mildred, alias Mary
Ann, and Mrs. Bauman checked her, cry-
ing in the loud stage-whisper of twenty years
ago, “Sssssssssssssh !”
“ ‘And though I have the gift of prophecy and
understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and
though I have all faith so that I could remove
mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.’ ”
“They run us doAvn, but avc ’elp deservin’
cases, said Mfl Ired, alias Mary Ann, Avith
conscious self-ri shteousness,
“Sssh.” said Sirs. Bauman; and “Ssssh.”
said Alice and 'essie and the superannuated
ones.
“ ‘And though I bestow all my goods to feed the
poor ; and though I give t-y body to be burned, and
have not charity, it profit th me nothing.’ ”
A change of atmosphere had come. That
splendid voice, uttering immortal Avords
played upon them as the wind upon a
harp ; and at last the actor lost all conscious-
ness of his art, Avhile yet retaining it.
“He’s the boy for a revivalist,” said the
author to the artist. “That voice of his
would tear the souls out of stock-brokers
Avho’d made enough money to turn honest.
Why. he’d make Lucrece accuse herself of
deadly sin.”
But the artist did not smile —the Avords
had got him : he Avas thinking.
“ ‘Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity
envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed
up.
“ ‘Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her
own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil.’ ”
“Everybody’s talkin’ evil about us,” said
Mrs. Bauman, and Peter the actor in a flash
said; “Be thou chaste as ice and pure as
suoav thou shall; not escape calumny,”, and
was back as quickly to the epistle to the
Corinthians: —
“ ‘Rejoieeth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth ;
Beareth all things ; believeth all things :
Hopeth all things ; endureth all things.’ ”
The voice had broken through the drugged
peace of active and retired vice alike. It
had found a soft spot even in the highly
respectable retired garrotters. Jessie's cigar-
ette fiend had lost the foolish grin he wore
always in the presence of a superior. All
the awful furnishings, and the carpet that
was like rhubarb stew spilled, and the garish
gaslight, faded. The women, with all the
music of the voice and little sense of its
message stirring their emotions, suddenly
felt that the air they breathed had become so
thick and heavy that they must find a new
atmosphere or die. But the new atmosphere
seemed to come to them and then they felt
unclean —-too filthy for the new world the
voice had opened unto them.
“ ‘Charity never faileth; but whether there be pro-
phecies they shall fail; whether there be tongues they
shall cease; whether there be knowledge it shall
vanish away.
“ ‘For we know in part and we prophesy in part;
“ ‘But when that which is perfect is come, then
that which is in part shall be done away.
“ ‘When 1 was a child, 1 spake as a clpld, I under-
stood as a child, I thought as a child ; but when I
became a man 1 put away childish things.’ ”
“That’s right,” said Titian-liair. “When
we’re kids we’re clean.”
“Shut up,” said Mildred, alias Mary Ann,
but she said it kindly. More than histrionic
etl’ect was in the actor’s voice. Reverence
and melancholy became triumph as he read :
“ ‘For now we see through a glass darkly, but then
face to face. Now X know in part, but then shall 1
know even as also I am known.’ ”
“I wouldn’t like people to know me all
through,” said Mildred, (tlias Mary Ann.
1 ler eyes were full of tears —*the tears that
help the least, because they are cried over
spilt milk.
“ ‘And now abideth faith, hope, charity—these
three, but the greatest of these is charity.’ ”
Ile closed the book and put it down, and there
was silence —silence in which till there felt
the desire to be alone —alone and clean. All
but Mrs. Ba uman. She thought of a few
crimes that had not slipped her memory, and
felt afraid to be alone, and in the mere
animal craving for the sound of voices and
the nearness of somebody, she spake.
“Thank yer,” said Mrs. Bauman. “Thank
yer—read somethin’ else.”
“No,” said the actor, himself now half
sober, “it's time we left.”
“I’m off to by-bye meself.” said Mildred.
alias Mary Ann. “(J’night, mister, yer done
me good. G'night. Oh ! if that big waster
Airy came back now I’d close up forgiv’
’iin,”
“What wus that y’ said first?” asked Alice,
who had forgotten charity already and re-
membered vanity, hiding her ugliness in her
tresses. “Yes. that’s it —‘the glory of ’erair.'
G’night. mister, if you must go.”
The three men followed the first ancient
janitress down the passage, but before they
reached the door Mrs. Bauman pressed half
a sovereign into the withered hand of the
second superannuated fllte de joic and said
hoarsely:—
“ ’TJrry after the gen'l’man an’ give 'im
that! Five shillin’s a bottle’s quite good
enuf f’r klonial ale —seven-an’-six’s too much.
Tell ’im I wouldn’t take ’im down—with
'is ’eavenly voice, I wouldn’t.”
.She looked up at the porti’ait of the de-
ceased mariner as if for commendation as
tlic front door slammed. And immediately
all the devils of the vicious and the vulgar,
the squalid, the cruel, the greedy, and the
mean began to clamor for re-entrance to
the house.
“But the greatest of these is charity.”

« i FIG for the world’s wealth ! Who’ll
_ _% buy from me
-A_jL A white shell from the sea’s rim,
jade leaf of a tree,
A fuchsia flower and a robin’s feather, opal
wing of a bee?
A fig for the world’s wealth ! Who’ll buy
from me?”
Ho sat him down in the moonlight on a small
brown stone,
He opened his little knapsack up, and me all
alone.
Then “Hey. folk; and ho. folk!” merrily
shouted he.
“Hurry, for soon I must go, folk; so come,
folk, and see.”
Then “Hi. sir; and why, sir! What is your
cost ?” quoth I.
“Treasures you have, hut the likes of them I
shouldn’t care to buy.
Sure, berries there are on hush and bough,
and leaves blow everywhere.
Have you a coral necklet now, or a comb for
a lady’s hair?”
“Olio, brother; so, brother !” He twirled his
peaky cap.
“Treasures there are, I know, brother, that
finer seem, mayhap;
But he who buys of my ware, and pays a
paltry fee.
Buys that which is rarer than gold-cloth
and whiter than ivory.
“I’ve a philtre of sun from a reedy pool and
a song of sailing ships,
I’ve a couple of notes from an Irish tune
and a kiss from a girl’s red lips.
Rubbish they are, as you say, brother, and
foolish and vain, maybe;
But their value lies in a poet’s eyes and a
lover’s dream,” said he.
I laughed at him as he stood there, and the
moon laughed down from the sky.
“Sure, find me a penny ribbon,” I said, “and
gladly I’ll come and buy;
But 'the wares you show me now, sir, are
tricks for a child to see.
Not I. sir; goodbye, sir! The world’s wealth
for me!”
And I left him there in the moonlight with a
rueful smile in his eyes—■
For I have been poet and lover too, but I’ve
grown wise.

REFRIGERATING AND
ICE-MAKING MACHINERY.
While the Greatest Selling factor in our machines is probably
their ECONOMY IN RUNNlNG—which is pertinent to the times
—their DEPENDABILITY counts a great deal for their
popularity. Even under the most severe conditions they can be
relied upon to give “CONSISTENT SERVICE.’’ Their strong
construction, and the great care taken in their manufacture is
the reason for this. Machines installed 25 years ago are still
at work to-day, giving the same service as when first installed.
We study your requirements and design the layout of your
plant, not only to accomplish a given result, but to do so with
an initial expenditure and maintenance cost. Our extensive
experience we place at your service.
