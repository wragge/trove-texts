Hudson’s Eumenthol TootH Powder
SECURES SOUND WHITE TEETH AND A HEALTHY MOUTH.
Some practical reasons why Hudson’s Eumenthol Tooth Powder how to uaa thi powdh,
should be used for Cleansing and Preserving the Teeth.
BECAUSE it contains the Germicidal and Antiseptic virtues
that have made Eumenthol Jujubes famous the world over.
BECAUSE it is not only an Antiseptic and Germicide, but
cleanses mechanically, owing to the evolution of oxygen when in
contact with water or moisture.
BECAUSE it is the oxygen which whitens the teeth so wonder-
fully, and wards off decay as no other preparation for the teeth
can do, or will do, without affecting the Tooth Enamel.
BECAUSE the Committee of the British Dental Association
recommends Powder in preference to Pastes, Liquids or Soaps for
cleasing and preserving the teeth.

Flinders
The Life of Captain Matthew Flinders,
R.N., by Prof. Ernest Scott, of Melb. Uni-
versity, author of Terre Napoleon and The
Life of Laperouse, will take its place as one
of the great biographies in our language.
The inexplicable fact that hitherto no full
biography of the first man to circumnavi-
gate Australia has appeared is also a for-
tunate fact. Flinders has waited a cen-
tury for his biographer, and it was worth
this silence of a hundred years to find Ernest
Scott. An immense amount of labor has
gone into the foundations of this work.
Every available scrap of manuscript or print
even remotely bearing on Flinders’ life-story
has been carefully traced, in many cases
as far as Paris and Caen (Normandy), de-
ciphered and pondered: the bibliography
occupies many pages, and includes no less
than eight manuscript sources meticulously
cyanided. And to this fervor of research
must be added Ernest Scott’s lucid literary
style and his interest in the personal side of
his subject. Equipment, style, sympathy,
and his subject combine to make a brilliant
achievement in biography.
&
The life of Flinders was packed with
adventure. Robinson Crusoe woke in this
Lincolnshire schoolboy’s mind the ambition
to make discoveries of his own. He studied
navigation works and practised chart-mak-
ing in the quiet of the fens; then the chance
came and he joined the navy as “lieutenant’s
servant.” Luck was witli him from the
start. He went to sea under William Bligh,
who had, in his turn, sailed with Cook. It
was on Bligh's second voyage to Tahiti for
breadfruit —the first voyage had ended in
the famous mutiny-—that gave Flinders, at
18, his chance to see the world. On his
return to England he took part in the battle
off Brest against the French. But Australia
called —an Australia that was unknown and
amorphous.
The continent grew on the map of the
world gradually, slowly, almost accidentally.
It emerged out of the unknown, like some
vast mythical monster heaving its large
shoulders dank and dripping fi’om the un-
fathomed sea, and metamorphosed by a kiss
from the lips of into a being fair
to look upon and rich in kindly favors. It
took two centuries and a half for civilised
mankind to know Australia, even in form,
from the time when it was clearly under-
stood that there was such a country, until
at length it was mapped, measured and cir-
cumnavigated.
During the Middle Ages not only was it
thought impossible that there could be an
antipodes, but it was held to be heretical
to have a belief in the possibility. Later
on the map-makers, annoyed by the large,
empty space at the bottom of their charts,
usually filled it in with delightful pictures
of devils. They must have foreseen the
trusts. When Flinders came out to Aus-
tralia at the beginning of the nineteenth cen-
tury nothing was known about the south
coast; it was not known whether the con-
tinent was one or two islands; it was be-
lieved that a strait separated N.S.W. from
the western part, known as New Holland;
it was not known that Van Diemen’s Land
was an island.
Upon the ship that brought Flinders to
Sydney he found his closest friend, George
Bass. The two did valuable exploring work
in the neighborhood of the settlement. It was
only because Flinders could not get leave
that he did not accompany Bass, the ship’s
surgeon, on his remarkably adventurous voy-
age in a boat that led to his discovery of
Bass Strait. However, in the usual leaky
and badly found vessel in which he was fated
to make all his discoveries, Flinders with
Bass circumnavigated Van Diemen’s Land.
The subsequent fate of Bass is probed by
Ernest Seott to the most probable conclu-
sion. The scant evidence shows that Bass
took up the contraband trade with South
America. There he disappeared, evidently
captured by the Spaniards; and there is no
evidence to disprove the legend that he ended
his life as a slave in the Spanish mines.
PROGRESS!
Back in England six years later, Flinders
married, and was, thanks to his own energy
and to Joseph Banks’ interest, appointed to
the Investigator, another coffin-sliip, with
orders to explore the whole of the Aus-
tralian coast. He had meant to take his
young wife to Sydney with him, but the
Admiralty, which wasn’t on its honeymoon,
forbade. Confronted with the choice of giv-
ing up his exploration or his wife, Flinders
metaphorically threw his wife overboard.
But it must be remembered that he expected
to return within a few years. Two French
vessels, suspected of designs upon the new
continent, started before him; but Flinders
had charted the whole of the unknown south
coast before he met the French ship; and
his management of his ship was so fine and
his care of his crew’s health so admirable that
he brought his vessel to Sydney without loss
of a man from disease, while the crews of both
the French vessels were almost decimated
by scurvy. And Baudin had actually missed
Port'’Phillip. Then Flinders set forth on his
rotten craft, the Investigator, to sail round
Australia. He charted Torres Strait and
the Gulf of Carpentaria, then had to careen
his ship. The carpenters reported that in
12 months there would be scarcely a sound
timber in her, but that with luck and fine
weather she might survive six months.
Flinders recognised that in such a state the
vessel could not he of any use to survey the
coasts, as it would be dangerous to keep her
close inshore. He ran for Timor, and then
sailed round Australia in a grim race against
destruction, with a crew down with dysen-
tery and six men dead. A hard gale, it was
found, would have sent the Investigator to
investigate the bottom of the ocean; “She
must have crushed like an egg and gone
down.”
It being impossible to return to England
in such a derelict, Flinders got passage in
the Porpoise, in order to hand over his
charts and solicit another vessel from the
Admiralty. But the Porpoise and another
small ship were wrecked on Wreck Reef,
over 700 miles from Sydney. Flinders, the
indomitable, brought a six-oar cutter and a
crew to Sydney for relief. After picking
up the castaways Flinders set forth to Eng-
land in another leaky tub, the Cumberland.
She leaked so badly that he had to put in
at Ile-de-France (Mauritius), then occupied
by France. Here General Decaen took him
for a spy, arrested him, and held him as a
prisoner for six years. The whole trouble,
Scott points out, would have probably been
amicably settled if Flinders had been less
THE ADVANTAGE OF BLACK-
LEGGING.
If the soldier betrays his comrades in martial
engagements he is hanged. If the
civilian betrays his comrades in indus-
trial engagements he is hugged.
careful of Ms dignity. As Scott notes, once
that Decaen had made Flinders his prisoner,
circumstances prevented him from releasing
him. The biographer’s account of this in-
cident is a masterly and unbiased analysis
of a proceeding that has given rise to a bit-
ter and still-reverberating controversy.
Judgment has now been delivered, and there
can be no appeal. The last years of Flinders
in England, and his early death are fully
documented and complete.
The chapters dealing with Bass’s fate, the
French menace to Australia, and Flinders’
life on Mauritius leave nothing for further
biographers.
Flinders is not a tradition: the naviga-
tors of our own time count him a companion
of the watch. The excellence of his charts
was such that to this day the Admiralty
charts for those portions of the Australian
coast where he did original work bear upon
them the honored name of Matthew Flin-
ders ; and amongst the seamen who habitu-
ally traverse these coasts no name, not even
that of Cook, is so deeply esteemed as his.
But Flinders did more than chart Aus-
tralia-: he named it. Scott’s chapter on the
naming of this continent is an interesting
story. The word had been used three times
in the 17th and 18th centuries, but without
reference to the continent. The word, there-
fore, was not of Flinders’ devising: it was
re-invented by him. He felt the need of a
single name for the island which he had
demonstrated to be one great continent. In
1804, in a letter, he stated: “I call the
whole island Australia, or Terra Australis” ;
and he noted that New Holland was its west-
ward part, and N.S.W. its eastern.
There are valuable appendices: Baudin’s
account of Encounter Bay, and Peron’s re-
port on Port Jackson. A word must in mere
justice be added in praise of the publishers,
Angus and Robertson, Sydney. The appear-
ance of the book is worthy of its contents.

The second collection of Will Dyson’s
Cartoons (London Daily Hekald, 9d.,
obtainable at N.S.W. Bookstalls) proclaims
the ex-BuLLETiN artist as the most power-
ful cartoonist in England. He is purely a
cartoonist, a cartoonist of revolt. His work
shows signs of Norman Lindsay’s brilliant
line, and of the sledge-hammer methods of
the modern German masters. It is inter-
esting to note that Dyson has introduced

IN THE MIDLANDS.
“Mummer, why don’t they forcibly feed us?”
W. J. Chidley was born in Victoria. His
wife is dead; he has one son in Australasia.
As a youth> he was articled to an architect,
but he soon felt he had more of importance to
say about men’s bodies than their houses. A
life-long study of his chosen subject resulted
in his picturesque attire and The Answer.
Of this famous pamphlet he has —in the inter-
vals of being arrqsted and of being vainly
examined for signs of lunacy—sold over 4000
copies, practically the whole profits of which,
he softly says, have gone into lawyers’
pockets. At present he is selling a revised
edition of The Anstver (2s. 6d.), for circu-
lation among adults only. But he intends
bringing out what he calls a “complete”
edition of the famous work, with an intro-
duction by Prof. Francis Anderson (Sydney
University). This introduction has already
been printed. “The greater part of this
work,” savs Prof. Anderson, “may be read
with profit, quite apart from any agreement
or disagreement with the thesis set forth in
the concluding chapters. Mr. Chidley writes
on philosophy and on the various philoso-
phical systems of the past with great fulness
of knowledge and with much critical insight.
He is a man of broad culture and sincere
and unselfish aims. It would be unneces-
sary to make this last remark, were it not
that Mr. Chidley is known to the greater part
of the public as a man who has recently been
prosecuted for circulating what was alleged
to be an immoral b00k.... Mr. Chidley’s
Treatise involves a treatment of that problem
which is regarded by many as immoral,
except in technical language in scientific
treatises. Mr. Chidley’s book does not seem
to me to be immoral either in intention or
treatment. Mr. Chidley may be wrong in
his main contention, both in his statement of
facts and his interpretation of them; but
there is nothing in his exposition wMch
justifies the charge of immorality and in-
decency brought against him, unless discus-
sion of sex problems be held to be ipso facto
indecent... .1 venture to recommend Mr.
Chidley’s History of Philosophy, which he is
now preparing for publication, as a work
which may be read without danger to one’s
morals, and with considerable profit to one’s
intelligence.” Wowsers please copy.
The Bookman, St. Paul’s House, Warwick Square,
London, E. 0., offers prizes of five guineas each

tory, and for the best original humorous poem

Spat’s Fact’ry, by Eaward Dyson (N.S.W.
Bookstall Co.), raises the question whether
there can be too much of a good thing.
Fact’ry ’Ands was a good thing, a brilliant
volume of Australian humor written in a
CONTROLLER OF THE TRAFFIC.
slang that would be undecipherable outside
this continent and confined for its matter to
a locale limited and almost unique. The
humor was broad, the characters were ex-
aggerated, and occasionally farcical, but the
author’s expertness and knowledge of life
made them human. Now the happenings of
Fact’ry ’Ands are continued, and apparently
they can be continued indefinitely. Yet to
the reader already sated with Dyson’s humor
and Dyson’s slang, this new volume has an
air of staleness. The audacity of that first
attempt carried Fact’ry ’Ands to popular-
ity ; we have grown accustomed to that
audacity, and no longer it excites us. The
fault is probably due, not to Dyson, but to
this page. Since the publication of the
earlier book this page has gone bald on the
top of its head, it grows tomatoes in its
suburban backyard, it carries the meat home
in a string bag, and it never, never goes out
without its goloshes.
At his recent Melbourne exhibition Arthur
Streeton in nine days sold £2499 worth of
pictures. A solid fact like that renders
superfluous the statement that last year
Streeton’s work was on exhibition at most
of the European capitals, or that at the Paris
Salon he gained a gold medal and other
honors. Streeton’s show in Melbourne must
have resembled a nine-to-ten winter drapery
sale. A Sydney show is due in mid-August:
there are still two-thii’ds of his pictures left
—some of his best work. At present he is
busy painting a series of panels of Sydney
Harbor for a final exhibition in Melbourne.
Streeton reports that the demand for Sydney
Harbors in Melbourne is steady, and that
the market is rising.
Art critics, trustees of National Galleries
and the blokes who don’t know anything
about art, but do know what they like, will
receive some preliminary education from a
collection of lantern slides of the works of
the best modern British masters that Arthur
Streeton purposes exhibiting in Sydney. The
agitation into which Adelaide has been
thrown by the purchase for her gallery of a
picture by William Orpen, A.R.A.. is suffi-
cient evidence of our ignorance of modern
art. _ The average number of visitors to the
Adelaide Gallery each week is 3000. The
interest aroused by Orpen’s picture has
raised the weekly attendance to 20,400.
Streeton has been asked to lecture about
Ornen _in Adelaide; and his collection of
slides includes six buff-orpentons.
Wild-Briar and Wattle-Blossom by J. J.
Malone (Linehan, Little Collins-street,
Melb., 2s. 6d.), is the utterance- of
a fresh and pleasant voice telling in simple
words the loveliness of Australia, seen
through the author’s misty memories of Ire-
land. J. J. Malone is no poet, but his
simplicity does not offend. His facile style
is best illustrated by a stanza such as this:
there are hundreds more of the same
quality:—
The sun rose o’er the towering hills,
And shot its golden quiver;
And down the gorges twinkling rills
Ran to the welcoming river;
The lyre-bird whistled through the trees,
Whose forest shades protect her,
And, wattles flung unto the breeze
The god’s own native nectar;
The mute lips of the muse it stirred,
And song again it brought her.
The day I rode to Gaffney’s Creek,
Beside the Goulburn water.

MAKE UP YOUR
MIND TO HAVE
A PERFECT
BUST
There are to-day hundreds of women who were once thin, flat-
bosomed, hollow-cheeked and generally' scraggly in appearance, and
suffering the eifccts of ana-mia and defective digestion, who are now for
the first time in their lives healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked, and
enjoying the full vigor of robust womanhood, as the result of a few
weeks under our wonderful
"FLESH-FOOD” TREATMENT.
Many women whose figures have been spoiled by maternal duties
have been entirely restored to splendid form,, and flat-eliested young
women who suffered slow development have had the fault corrected by
this treatment with lasting effect.
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is
beyond question, and its use no demand upon the subject s time. Many
cases gained up to six pounds a week, and an increase in bust measure-
ment up to 8 and 10 inches. Guarantee given in every case.
ANY WOMAN who lacks good bust development lacks the -one essential that creates a perfect
appearance. Lack of proper bust development, hollow cheeks and "salt-cellars ’ quickly take from
a woman the bloom and freshness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been your lot in
so far as natural development is concerned, but science has found a way to correct your deficiency.
Even though you have never been full-bosomed, and though you have been attenuated all your life,
if you suffer from no wasting disease, your bosom .can be fully, developed and your weight increased
to normal. /7 - HAS BEEN DONE FOR THOUSANDS ——WHY NOT YOU?
You can readily see the effect of an increase in your weight or measurements. It is not neces-
sary to imagine you are being benefited. See what Miss M. BOURKE, of lamworth, says-
“ Yours to hand, and am pleased to state that "your treatment increased my
weight considerably over two stone, and my bust measurements by several
inches. Since using it I am much better in health, and my flesh is now firm
and I feel stronger and more vigorous. I thank you for the trouble you have
taken, and am grateful for all you have done for me.”
We publish an interesting book on the subject of attenuation and develop-
ment, and will send same and a FREE SAMPLE TREATMENT to.you FREE
OF CHARGE upon receipt of a’2d. stamp to pay part postage. All communica-
tions private and confidential. Write or call to-day for full particulars. [lBlB

KNOWLEDGE IS POWER
Thirty years of assiduous study of The Hair and its Treatment, and all
Capillary Diseases as they affect the Scalp and Hair, have given me the means
of Preserving the Hair, and producing a new growth, after all other preparations
have failed.
Mr Fred Pcakman, of Wairoa, New Zealand, is another wonderful case. II is hairdresser tells me
he had not a scrap of hair, and now, after a few months’ treatment with my preparations, he has
got a splendid growth of hair.
Mr. O’Rourke, Wee Waa, New South Wales, writes: “My head, which was nearly bald, has now
come back to its usual growth.”
Mr. Sutherland states: “I bad only a little down on my bead when T commenced to use your
SPECIAL.' PAItASKNE and COSMO LOTION: now 1 have a beautiful bead of hair.”
Gentlemen who are going bald should use Special Parasene and Cosmo Lotion, one at
night and the oilier in the morning, and wash the head once a week with Sliampuna.

“it gives me great pleasure to inform you that 1
have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by
vour wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years, sometimes Soz. to lOoz. in

tobacco, and, although I am continually in the com-
panv of smokers, I do not have the least desire to
smoke, therefore T consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizzi-

have cverv reason to believe were caused through the

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Petitioner.
In sad, dark robes, and veiled,
A shadowed grief was she;
And all the court was stirred
With heartfelt sympathy.
Her dainty fingers held
A snow-white handkerchief,
Which caught the pearly tears
That came lo her relief.
When some poor Wound was hurt;
But still she bore her part
in spite of all that told
An ill-used, breaking heart.
A broken-hearted wife.
She sought for her decree,
To free herself from one
Who judged himself as free.
In stern and manly wrath
Her counsel warmly spoke,
And round the crowded court
Applause in murmurs broke;
The sheriff’s tenderness
His sympathy expressed;
His Honor’s tones to her
Unusual notes possessed;
The counsel for the man
Seemed tamed—yes, even he
Was deeply touched, and spoke
Apologetic’ly.
A sweet young spirit wrecked!
A faithful, loving wife,
Condemned to live for aye,
A saddened, loveless life !
The case could only go
One way. The Judge could feci.
He said, that her decree
Her heart could never heal.
He spoke, with lofty scorn,
About cross-charges false. ...
That night she danced till morn,

HAMER.
Chapter and Verse.
John Murray, in answer to the Rev. Worrall’s
attack on him for having lent countenuce to boxing-
exhibitions, referred that gentleman to Matthew:
“Judge not that ye be not judged.”
The Curate muttered: “Do not swear,
For evil words return.
They make your brother rend his hair
And spit in wrath and spurn.”
The sinner said : “O Curate dear,
If you but bring your Bible here
You’ll find the Prophets swore—
See Nahum v. and 4.”
Again the Good Man spake his mind
The giddy sport to check;
“You racing man, you go it blind
Until your soul’s a wreck!”
Returned the Sport: “But old Jehu
I guess lie knew a thing or two
On horsey topics. See
Kings chapter ix. and 8.”
“Beware the giddy dance, my son !”
The warning Pilot cried.
“But we have warrant for our fun,”
The tripping youth replied,
“For Israel’s David, how he scored
By dancing hard before the Lord.
7/(.v godly ways are mine.
(Hosea vi. and 9.)”
The Killjoy cried : “Flirt not by night
And frivol not by day,
Lest cunning wiles of woman light
Thy morals lead astray.”
“O Killjoy, dear, I do but tread
Where Solomon the Sage bath led
llow can I then do wrong?
See ‘Proverbs’ and ‘The Song.’ ”
Said Broadbrim : “Drop your wicked guns
And melt your bay’nets down;
Forbear to teach your gentle sons
To shoot their foernen down.”
The soldier laughed : “I’ve heard before —
‘The Lord. Tie is a Man of War.’
I’m fighting in His crew
(Isaiah vii. and 2).”

These Autumn Days.
Before old Winter whistles up
Ilis howling;, foam-flecked hounds,
And Autumn drains her final cup
And throws away the grounds.
Let’s strike the lyre and sing the praise
Of crystal, clear Autumnal days.
We tired of Summer ere she died.
For her too ardent breath
Each limp, perspiring lover fried;
So do not mourn her death,
These Autumn days when air and view
Still hold the charm of last night’s dew.
The cooling breeze is like a drink
And you can see for miles :
The dew-cleared harbor seems to wink
And smile a million smiles.
The how-wave like a lip draws hack
And foam-teeth show our morning track.
The eyes of Memory are clear,
This limpid Autumn day,
And Long Ago seems verv near
Instead of far away.
Old fountains, long to dust resigned,
Are playing freshly in my mind.
The cooling breath of Autumn brings
Some magic to my heart:
That rather weary organ sings
As if it ne’er would part
With Life, or let the body stop
Scuffling about this writing shop.
To-day T would take ship and steam
Unto the world’s clear edge—
Go driving straightly at my dream
With a good ship for wedge.
T would come home again, all me !
When summer bush-smoke blows to sea f

I’ltICE Su.
PROLOGUE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Enter, before the curtain, WAR, an old, bald, bespectacled man, in his gorgeous uniform of Generalissimo. He speaks the Prologue.
Ladies and gentlemen, the players wait.
But ere I ring the impatient curtain up
Upon this drama, I would have you know
What spectacle I have for you prepared,
What play it is that, after many years
Of preparations and postponements, I
Have for your craved approval proudly built.
You may have viewed some pretty plays of
war, '
Wherein a nice young officer arrayed
In scarlet or in khaki swaggered through
Some well stage-managed battles, for his
King. „
(There was no blood to spoil the pretty
The dead that fell fell cleanly, neatly killed ,
And if the hero had to nurse a wound
He lost an arm, whereo’er his sweetheait
grieved. ~
He was not shot in places unromantic ,
His entrails did not clutter up the scene ,
He did not lose his nose.) But this, my
great curtain now divides from
Is War!’War unadorned, the naked thing.
There are no medals and no epaulettes
In my poor drama. Stolid business-men
My generals are, who play a placid game
Di dominoes with little army-coips,
And t Jg s Wlth mUrdered men for their mls ‘
My drama has no decorative scene;
For all is smoke and flame and mud and
noise
And squirming things that once
Dismembered, crunched or shattered, still
alive
Or fortunately dead. No bugle shrills
Its clarion call. No colors blaze in pride
Before these grimy regiments. No charge
Of gallant horses nobly sweeps the field.
But here and there a soldier lies and snipes
A fellow-soldier somewhere out of sight;
Or screaming shrapnel brings untidy death ;
Or from the sky there floods a clotted red
Where grim mechanics grapple fatuously
In brittle little chariots of air.
There are a thousand scenes within my play,
It ranges o’er a mighty continent,
Perchance oer all the globe. It shows each
race
I n blmd and sullen anger flinging death —
Strange, poisoned, sudden, scientific death—
To fellow-men across its frontier line.
It shows a continent all desolate,
So sown lvith barren bullets that no green
Will ever grow again. It shows vast towns
In the grim clutch of hunger-driven mobs ;
It shows sweet villages all smelling rank
With putrefying corpses; and it shows
Dead women and dead children and dead
babes.
The actors in my drama are but men,
Mere men and women, rather like your-
selves,
And starving children like the little ones
Each night in cosy cots you hush to sleep.
The soldiers are but men in uniform —
The ordinary men you see in trams
Or work with in your office. They are all
Just husbands, brothers, fathers, lovers,
armed
With rifles, not umbrellas, curtly told
To kill some other rather decent chaps
Because they live across a little line
Made arbitrarily upon a map.
But though a continent I have for stage
I cannot picture war; for far beyond
Each battlefield another hidden fight
Goes on relentlessly. For every man
That you see smashed by shells, by cholera
killed,
Disembowelled, lopped or dying of gangrene,
Picture a little house, a pleasant home
With wife and children waiting anxiously,
Not knowing—maybe, ne’er indeed to know —
If they are widowed, orphaned. Picture
this
For every one of all these patient men
Hidden in trenches, spattered grey with oil
In aeroplanes, or deep in submarines
Beneath the sanguined sea.
Nay, picture more!
The curtain that I wait the word to draw
Will show you not a drama but yourselves.
This kindly curtain long has held you safe
From all the horrors of my spectacle.
It is a fragile frontier line between
You and the grim realities of war.
And when I ring the curtain up, beware!
The action on the stage will spread to you :
My shells wilt strike and rend the occupants
Of gallery and stalls and circle. You,
The actors and the victims of my play!
You are the soldiers and the soldiers’ wives,
The little children waiting for their dad;
You are the dying, the dismembered dead;
And you the hungry and demented mob,
And you the widow and the fatherless.
The manager impatient grows, and loud
The orchestra of slaughter sounds its paean :
The curtain tautens Shall I ring it up?

THURSDAY, AUGUST 6, 1914.
WHEN OLD EUROPE BLAZED UP.
Lately the war resumed business at the
old address near the Danube. What exactly
ought to be done with the wild-cat States
and tribes of south-eastern Europe only a
god-like intelligence can tell. They are nearly
all wild and most of them are cat.
The beginnings of them date very far back.
For nearly 1000 years before its final perish
the old Greek Empire was supposed to be in
its last illness, and as far back as the year
500, or even earlier, whole nations came down
to pick the bones of the richest carcase on
earth. Unfortunately for them the carcase
wasn’t ready. The capacity of that
dead body for getting out of bed in
its last moments, and putting up one
more scrap, was the marvel of history. All
manner of broken tribes wandered back
disappointed, and, their old homes and
clubbing grounds being occupied by new-
comers, they pegged out allotments wherever
they could and dwelt in great wrath and dis-
content with their neighbors. When the
Turks secured the long-postponed cadaver at
Constantinople—and, incidentally, found
nothing in the pockets of the deceased—they
began to make great trouble in Central
Europe. So the wrath and discontent grew
worse, and the neighbors became more un-
pleasant, and the confusion was worse con-
founded. Partly owinv to these events there
are some 18 distinct races in Austria-Hun-
gary, and only three of them amount to
much. There are probably 12 separate and
distinct racial hatreds and a few humble
grudges. The nations are grievously
mixed, so that it is possible to find a smail
province where the population is fairly well
divided among three or four or' five conflict-
ing elements, each of which defines liberty
as the right to be on top and to jump with
both feet on its rivals. Consequently poli-
tical freedom, in the conventional accepta-
tion of the term, is a thing to be administered
very carefully. Many ill-assorted folk from
south-eastern Europe have emigrated to the
United States and have proved just as mixed
and just as incomprehensible in Colorado or
around Chicago or in the coal mines of
Pennsylvania as they did in their old dig-
gings. One reason why industrial trouble in
certain parts of Uncle Sam’s country con-
sists so largely of shooting is that the gun
speaks all languages, while the exiles speak
so many tongues that effective and intelligent
combination is difficult.
Providence, of somebody, sent the German
Of Vienna to police this ramshackle set of
peoples, and a good deal must be forgiven
to that stodgy bureaucrat by reason of the
difficulty of his job. It is even worse than
it looks, for many of the tribes have outside
relations. Whether, for instance, the Slav
iu Servia should annex his adjacent fellow-
Slav, the Croat, now belonging to Austria,
who doesn’t feteii use the same alphabet, 'oh
whether Austria should round off its Slav
territory by annexing Servia, and whether
Russia, as the boss Slav state, should inter-
fere, are points which open the way for a
heap of disagreement. Anyhow, an attempt
was recently made to throw light on the
argument by the murder of the heir to the
Austrian empire, and his wife. The un-
pleasant deed was done by Servians, and
was openly rejoiced over by Servians. Also
there was reason to suspect that it was
planned in Servia, apd that the Servian
Government wouldn’t have won a Melbourne
Cup in its haste, either to prevent the crime
or to arrest the perpetrators. The bureau-
crats at Vienna demanded more speed pnd
more retaliation and a number, of othef
tilings,. and failing to get them they threw
the brick .of war and spoke the clod of
hostility. Thereupon Europe uttered a. howl
of dismay, it wondered (1) whether Russia
would be forced, to take a hand against
Austria lest the loyal Slav of Russia should
shoot liis emperor for abandonment of his
fellow-Slav of Servia; (2) whether this
interference would bring in Germany, Italy
and Roumania; (3) whether France would
• pick up its gun to support its. Russian ally;
(4) whether Britain would find itself com-
pelled to help its, ally, France; (5) whethet
the latter would try to recover amid the
confusion the two provinces it lost in 1871}
(6) whether somebody would attempt in the
middle of the shindy to steal the microscopic
kingdoms of Holland and Belgium; (7)
whether the trouble would blow over and the
inevitable row be postponed. The trouble
failed to blow over, and Russia, Germany,
France, Austria and Servia promptly
became mixed, with Britain and half-a-dozen
other countries hurrying up in the back-
ground.
Almost at the beginning of the discussion
things happened that were ominous for Aus-
tralia. The stock exchanges in Russia and
Holland closed with a slam. Those of Aus-
tria and Prussia followed suit. The stock
exchange at Liverpool (England—not the
place near Sydney where the Old Men’s
Homes are) did the same. So did the con-
cern at Manchester. The panic struck far-
off Canada (a heavily-borrowing country
like Australia) so suddenly that the
Montreal stock exchange went home to roost.
The great jobbing establishment at London
didn’t close at first, but business dropped to
practically nothing, and British Government
securities fell to a nominal quotation of less
than 14s. in the f. They were in no demand
at that figure. Finally the London Ex-
change shut —for the first time since the
days of Julius Caesar, or thereabouts.
Also gold payments were suspended.
Paris decided to give its stock gamblers an
extra month in which to settle. All manner
of events arose. In three or four sudden
days affairs reached a point at which
Denham, and Holman, and Peacock and
Scaddan and Massey and the rest couldn’t
have floated a new loan or renewed an old
one except on preposterous terms, and per-
haps not on any terms. A number of finan-
ciers committed suicide owing to the bottom
having fallen out of the wild cat. They
were mostly Germans. The vast armies got
on the move, and everybody put his faith
in Providence and his gun. Also the Red-
fern (Sydney) cadets were called out.
* * * *
A great European war is full of possibili-
ties for Australia. This country will be
in the centre of the whirlpool, to say nothing
of the fact that, unlike Austria and Ger-
many, it may have an Asiatic whirlpool of
its own. If the new loan doesn’t float —and
how easily it may refuse to float is evident
when Russian, Dutch, Canadian and British
stock exchanges can be paralysed by the
mere appearance of war on the horizon —
public works will be suspended and thou-
sands of men thrown out of employment on
the instant. If the old loan can’t be renewed
when it falls due then there will be a sus-
pension of the national credit, and property
values will fall like a house of straw in a
gale. Solid concerns like the A.M.P.
Society and the Bank of New South Wales
and the Government Savings Banks will
almost certainly begin to crack on their
foundations, while smaller concerns will sag,
and still smaller ones will drop to pieces.
The importing business will be cut to the
bone, for it is only the constant flotation
of foreign loans which enables this country
to pay for its mass of foreign imports. Aus-
tralia may have no desire to declare war
against Servia or Switzerland or Bolivia
or any other remote place that never did it
any harm, but if some other Power, in which
it also takes no interest, starts a war, and
the conflict spreads, the results may be
amazing. Our rich, gold-producing continent
has got so badly into the habit of borrowing
gold from countries that don’t produce the
precious metal, that a large-sized scrap at
the other side of the world may reduce it
to beggary. It has sold its prospects for a
thousand years ahead in order to buy steel
rails and locomotives and artificial manures
and tinned sardines and feathered hats from
the foreigner, instead of getting to work and
making the goods itself. It has become more
dependent on the courtesy and forbearance
and good luck of outside financiers than any
other place in history. A week after Cohen
of Europe is driven to state that he can’t
even look at the new lOU the cities of Aus-
tralia will swarm with mendicants. A month
later, when he says he can’t find the money
to renew the expiring loan, Darling Point
and Toorak will be d.riven to consider
whether they can afford to buy a new pair
of boots, or whether the old pair will hang
out a while longer. It .has been the custom
to regard Cohen as a sort of Rock of Ages.
Unhappily he lives on the. brink of a preci-
pice, like any other financier. It may be a
gilded precipice, but it is as precarious as
if it was greased.
* - - * * *
But the evil possibilities of a purely Euro-
pean war, so far as Australia is concerned,
are mostly financial. They are bad enough,
still they are financial. If some adjacent
Great Power—perhaps an unreasonable and
combustible brown creature which objects to
anybody save itself practising an exclusion
policy—took the opportunity to fish in the
troubled waters around otir coasts new
complications might arise. He couldn’t be
dealt with by the simple process of filing our
schedule. Australia would have to stand
on its own defence, and its defence is poor.
Yet the event is only the sort of thing which
may be expected. Every country with a
grievance or an ambition selects the handiest
time to settle the question. Russia tore
up the Black Sea treaty when France, the
principal guarantor, was in a state of armed
and disastrous annoyance with Germany.
Britain sent its famous expedition into Tibet
when Russia was busy with Japan and mis-
fortune. Also, Britain robbed its friend
Turkey of Cyprus when Turkey was having
a bad time with Russia, and its bayonet was
bent and its fez squashed. Roumania stood
out of the recent Balkan wars, and then it
robbed Bulgaria of a big strip of territory
because the Bulgars were too exhausted to
resist. Austria occupied Bosnia and Herzego-
vina at the same date when Britain took
Cyprus, and took thfem from the same person
and for the.same I’eason —i. 6., that the timd
was ripe, if Japdn chooses to resent,Aus-
tralia's absolutely ftedessary Colored Exclu-
sion policy, pnd selects the most convenient
time. to do the deed, it will be
simply, playing the ordinary game. It
will be no worse than any other
Power, and no worse than any Labor Union
or Employers’ Union which goes to arbitra-
tion and then disregards the award. Nothing
will be gained by appeals to treaties, oi- to
the Hague Peace Foolishness—which lids
already fled for home, Or to right and justice.
Uhe country with the strongest force decides
what is right and justice, and its decision
stands. All that Australia can do in such d
cdse is to take stock of its resources.
* * * *
These are some of the resources
(1) An army in which hardly a single soldier is
more than 21 years of age.
(2) A very small and very raw navy.
(3) A grievous lack of factories for the supply
of rifles, cannon, ammunition, warships, railway
trains, steel rails, uniforms, boots and the thousand
and one essentials for a campaign.
(4) A busted credit —for it will be busted then.
This country has of late found it hard enough to
borrow the money it wanted, even though the lender
was at peace, and the borrower wasn’t in trouble.
(5) A lamentable habit of planting all the big
cities and as much as possible of the public wealth,
the manufactures, the finance and the machinery of
government in big, ill-defended coastal cities. When
an enemy arrives on the nearest coast it is a far
cry to Delhi, Moscow, Teheran, Vienna, Berlin,
Paris, Madrid, the city of Mexico, Puebla, Tobolsk,
Birmingham, Lyons, Dresden, Munich, Oabul, Buda-
pest, Sofia or Pretoria. But when a nation puts
practically all its portable assets on the shore and
has no inland city worth twopence to retreat to, it
is taking chances.
(6) The railway congestion policy, by reason of
which the capture of one or two bloated and ill-
defended cities on the coast would enable an enemy
to cut the railway system to pieces.
(7) The mixed railway gauges, by reason of which
a comparatively small army, proceeding from (say)
Melbourne to the defence of Queensland, would pro-
bably spend from three to six weeks on the road
owing to the necessity to shift men and horses and
guns and stores from one train to another at the
borders.
(8) The fact that nearly half the Australian
coast-line has no railway communication with the
big centres of the south-east. The extension of the
railway from the south has been indefinitely post-
poned—apparently because two dreary opportunists
are afraid of losing votes in one State if they fix on
another as the southern terminus.
(9) The habit of importing goods (and loan money
to pay for the goods) from abroad, instead of im-
porting sturdy artisans (and defenders of the coun-
try) to make the goods here.
(10) The habit of sinking the fiscal issue.

the good times will last for ever, and that none of
the ill-fortune which has struck every other people
at one time or another will ever strike us.

The defences don’t look massive, and if,
when our turn comes, events move as swiftly
as they did last week, there will be small
chance of improving them. This country
may yet be found, on Bruce Smith’s birth-
day, making its great effort to defend the
North from behind a butter-box.

THE BASTILLE AT DARLING POINT.
The great full-blown, all-round European
war has started at last. It is appro-
priate, in the circumstances, for the
community to gather round its imported
grate, and stir up the fire with its Brum-
magem poker, and draw closer to the blaze
its foreign-made arm-chair, and consider
the position as it is likely to affect Aus-
tralia.
* * * *
A first effect of w T ar involving the
great money-lending nations must be a stop-
page of foreign loans. Britain, France and
the rest will need all their cash for them-
selves. The Australian States may then
have insufficient to pay their interest bills as
they fall due; they will certainly not have
enough to maintain their public works. In
consequence, most of the men employed on
railway extensions and duplication works,
in the Government dockyards, at Canberra,
on the Transcontinental, at the Holman
Ministry’s proposed Conservatorium of
Music, and in a thousand other directions,
will lose their jobs. Trade between Europe
and the Commonwealth will cease almost
entirely for obvious reasons. The shrink-
age in imports and exports will mean that
thousands of wharf-laborers, carters, shop
and warehouse employees, mechanics and
operatives in manufactories and garages
and engineering shops will be thrown out
of employment. Simultaneously the smaller
retail men will begin to go bankrupt. Most
of the mines will close down, partly owing
to the paralysis of industry abroad, partly
to the fact that there will be no vessels
available to take their products. Unem-
ployed actors, boxers, footballers, vaudeville
performers and restaurant waiters will
swarm on all sides, since the world always
begins by economising on its amusements in
time of stress. As the position grows more
acute the bigger business places, both in
the cities and the country, will drastically
reduce their staffs. In a very few weeks it
will be as though 50,DU0 strikes were raging.
Picture the situation of, say, Sydney in
such circumstances. Sydney will be in a par-
ticularly bad way, since most of the unem-
ployed will naturally gravitate there in the
hope of Government doles or food or relief
of one sort or another. But the Government
will have no money with which to pay doles,
and the shortage of food will be appalling.
For the first time Australians will realise
how many of their necessaries are imported.
According to the latest figures of Knibbs’s
Year Book the Commonwealth imported in
1910, from the U.K. alone, milk (preserved,
etc.), 'to the value of £124,116; confec-
tionery, £345,733; fish, £147,793; meats,
£34,260; grain, £36,825 ; and so on. Food-
stuffs of animal origin to the value of
£873,697 entered Australia from abroad in
this year. Practically all this country's
groceries and tobacco come from foreign
parts, and most of its drinks. Within 24
hours of the commencement of hostilities
between Austria and Servia “the prices of
necessaries all over the Continent had risen
100 per cent.,” to quote one of last Friday’s
cable-messages. In Australia many neces-
saries tvili not be merely expensive; they will
be unobtainable. When an unemployed crowd
is few in numbers and merely hard iip it
begs; but when it numbers thousands and
is starving it simply takes. There may
Come 4 time, in Sydney, wheil the alteady
somewhat futile police force Will abandon
the hopeless task of keeping order among
the armies of ravenous men and women who
will throng the streets and parks. In those
days the richest man wili not be the million-
aire who bolds an immense parcel of C.S.R.
Co. shares and a trunk full of gas debeh-
tiifes, and who owns streets of city pro-
perty, but the far-sighted individual who
lias fortified his suburban home, a.nd sunk a
well in the garden, and stocked the out-
houses with biscuits and tinned food. While
the crowd is looting the kitchens of the big
clubs, and retiring to the Domain to con-
sume the proceeds, and while the grocery
and confectionery departments at the Civil
Service Stores and Lassetter’s and
Anthony Horderns’ are being raided,
and while a thousand bars are in-
voluntarily supplying the multitude with
free drinks, the citizen who has made
provision against the coming storm will be
able to live, for a while, in security and
comfort, more or less.
* * * *
He will do well, however, not to
be idle. Every leisure moment will
need to be employed by him < throw-
ing up earth-works around his resi-
dence, laying barb-wire entanglements,
digging moats, sowing the approaches with
hidden mines, and in general preparing for
the worst. He will by these means insure
himself against trouble until the mob has
commandeered everything that is easy to
secure in other parts of the city. By that
time, however, word will doubtless have got
abroad that there is a rich store of eat-
ables at, say, Darling Point. Thrir owner
will automatically become a public enemy.
Amidst howls and execrations a move will
be made for his fortress. He will not be in
a position to fight. Beyond giving a display
of that truculent impassivity which one
observes in the sacked immigrant, lie will
probably do nothing while the revolutionaries
are hammering at his gates. The sort of
Bastille which is rushed together in a week
or so does not take long to fall. Unless the
miraculous intervenes the Darling Point
resident will have a bad time. He and his
family will be among the thousands of vic-
tims offered up to the importing and borrow-
ing habits. The whole situation constitutes
about as good an argument as a country
could want in favor of borrowing less and
manufacturing more.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Mild Protest by the Undersigned.
It would be interesting to know on what
principle the Sydney morning papers are
proceeding in regard to the Commonwealth
Electoral Act. Clause 181 of the Act says:
On and after the date of issue and before the
return of any writ.... every article, report, letter or
other matter commenting upon any candidate shall
be signed. Penalty, fifty pounds.
On Saturday last the Sydney Telegraph
printed a report of a speech by Joseph
Cook at Ballarat in which that statesman
alleged, amongst other things, that his rival,
Fisher, had “been handing out bribes.” In
another report Conroy was made to accuse
Tudor of having been responsible for the
arrival in Australia of the Meat Trust; and
in yet another Irvine charged Fisher with
being a “briber” and a “desperate gambler.”
None of them was signed. On the other
hand, a name and address were appended
by the Telegraph to a number of in-
nocuous little paragraphs, of which the fol-
lowing is a fair sample:—
The war in Europe and the apprehensions of exten-
sion are still overshadowing all other questions. The
Federal elections are suffering in common with every
public event. All the same, the progress is still
slowly proceeding.
The Herald’s political reports (1/8/T4)
were on the same lines as the Telegraph’s,
and they also were unsigned. But a signa-
ture was attached to a three-quarter column
of items such as this :—•
Persons who will be absent on polling day, Sep-
tember 5, from the electorate for which they are
enrolled, may now record their votes on making the
necessary declaration.
The law of the land is broken just as irre-
trievably by the publication of a signature-
less report of a speech in Federal politics as
it would be by the printing of a paragraph
drawing attention to the date of the elec-
tions, or to the influence on them of a
European war. At a rough estimate the
Herald and Telegraph already owe the
Treasury about £IOOO between them—assum-
ing that the English language, as it appears
in the Electoral Act, has any meaning. Far
be it from the writer to uphold this idiotic
measure. His protest is merely, against what
looks like injurious differentiation on
the part of the authorities. If one writer
has to give himself an unwanted advt. every
time he makes a remark about Federal poli-
tics, why not all? Have the Liberal papers
been accorded a private license to break the
law, and if so, why? The Cook Govern-


merit’s wide-flung reputation for imperish-
able probity of an almost Methodistical
character demands that this matter should
be cleared up.
[John Bede Dalley, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
Penelope in the Pulpit.
Dear Bulletin, —Early next month 10,000
Anglican parsons and churchwardens will
assemble and meet together in London to
discuss the “possibility” of women entering
the priesthood. Meanwhile newspapers are
shrieking against the “extravagance” of the
idea, and bishops and such pooh-pooh the
lady-parson proposition for “scriptural rea-
sons,” in the first place, and “in view of the
traditions —of the church.” Archbishop
Clarke, of Melbourne, put the objections in
those terms, but why the church’s man-made
regulations should be any more unalterable
than a country’s man-made constitution the
prelated Tory ’aforesaid didn’t condescend to
explain. Now, to any inquiring sinner who
drops casually into an Anglican place of
worship at worship-time the. gentleman in
(he pulpit seems almost as much out of
place as a male doctor at an accouchement.
The congregation is 85 per cent, feminine and
infantile, the children being simply disciples
of mother or auntie in the matter of church-
going. Of the small minority of men who
are listening to the other man, every two
out of three would probably prefer to be
receiving exhortation from a nice female
shepherd. Religion, iii all denominations, is
mainly a matter of feminine interest and
juvenile entertainment. In the Anglican
denomination it is particularly noticeable
that the men, as a rule, have lost all interest
in Church creeds and dogmas, prayers and
thanksgivings. Outside of the choir none
of the hymn singers are men, and the choir
is a worldly-minded organisation of amateur
artists whose soul —if they have one —is con-
cerned only with the technicalities of vocal-
ism. As for the organist, when he isn’t a
woman he is usually addicted to drink.
Church-workers in the, .parish are Women all
along the lihe; the waydeds, the .vicar
and the cbr'Ate ht'e men, and who shall say
that this ohe-sided arrangement is h success
now that “tta'ditioh” has lost its sanctity
and faith is confronted by the .facts and
theories of modern enlightenment? Within
the past 35 years there, has been only one
religious movement which possessed a force
of its .own, and is not wholly a success of
sound business managemept. The Salv’army,
the Harmy which preaches the crudest of
Christian doctrine, has effected religious com
version, of a sort, in tens .of thousands of
men. This for the reason that its preachers
have been largely women .as well .as men.
“General” Boom's first blood-and-fire cam;
paigns, with their testimony meetings, and
knee-drills, would have gone for very little
had there not been Happy Dinahs to bang
the cymbals and address the scoffers. The
Halleujah Lass has been the all-impo.rtant
factor in the diffusion of vociferous holiness.
The woman preacher, so contrary to the
“traditions of the churches,” has done mote
for Christianity, maybe, than any 10.000
parsons ordained since the Church of Eng-
land was born. Why should she not take
holy orders and climb into the pulnit?
Women do not really need the attraction
of a reverend man to draw them to church.
For that matter, a reverend pastoress might
prove a stronger draw, for the sex dearly
loves to see one of its own members bossing
any sort of theatrical show. And it is cer-
tain that a petticoat in the pulpit would
attract more men than go to an Anglican
church nowadays. In short,, the proposal
to admit women into the priesthood is. so
essentially reasonable, and so likely, to bring
new spirit into a very tired religion, that
the bishops are bound to denounce it as “un-
thinkable.” Nothing is thinkable to the
high episcopalian mind until it has been put
into practice.—Yours, etc., O.K.

Facts and Fogs.
A demand for the loan of Fisher’s ear: —
It would be of assistance to the electors and of
service to his party if Fisher would come down
occasionally from the general to the particular. I
was impressed by two of the projects he referred
to in his policy speech at Maryborough (Q-) * . a
State steamer service and orphan pensions, itt
both these matters I am satisfied Fisher's impulse
is on the right lines; yet I read him with disap-
pointment and dismay, These ire two important
questions, well worth fighting for; but Unless
Fisher mends his methods he is going to get mighty
little of that added support which these proposals
are put forward to secure. There is a practical side
to all projects of the kind, and it is this the com-
munity naturally wants to hear about. Take old-
age pensions. Where they were first introduced the
man in the front of the fight had the idea down in
black and white. He was able to estimate that
there would be a certain number of pensioners the
first year, so many the second, and thence on ; that
the cost each year would be this or that; that the
charge could be met in a certain way. The public
could understand this and argue the matter in the
light of ascertained facts and wax enthusiastic about
it. Fisher, on the other hand, just talked in the
air.
Heavy, sombre references to “the poor, ragged
schoolboys of England, inmates of institutions of
which the name is a disgrace to civilisation,” have
no point for Australians. All that kind of stuff
may be taken as read, or at best used merely to
support what is definite. Joe Cook or the gentle
Willy Kelly could use the same phrases without loss
of dignity or detachment from Liberalism. What
the people should hear from Fisher is a definite
proposal based on our own necessities and social
obligations. He should give us all the relevant
facts and figures. If he hasn’t got them, then this
Fabian attitude of his can have no possible value
to the constituencies. Likewise with State steamer
services. Fisher talks of these and his State
Produce Distributing Department in the same
nebulous strain. They would, he says, be factors
in reducing the cost of living—which may be true
or may not. Then he goes on without quoting a
single figure or outlining any plan to declare that
“these steamers carrying produce from one port in
the Commonwealth to another would beneficially
assist the wage-earners” ; that the operations of the
State Produce Department in “lifting the produce
of the farm, the forest and the mine, and making
advances to the producers at a lower rate of interest
than they now pay would encourage production and
confidence.” Has Fisher or anyone on his behalf
figured all this out—the cost of it, the possible
trading results, the approximate saving to be
secured by the purchaser of the fat lamb and the
nourishing potato? Can he say anything with cer-
tainty to either the suburban householder or the
proprietor of farm or orchard or vegetable garden ? •
If he can, he should. If he cannot, what’s the use
of offering the elector great masses of dough?

Kalgoorlie’s Pains and Prospects.
Dear Bulletin, —Kalgoorlie has been suffer-
ing from dry rot for a long time, and just at
the present moment the disease is merging
into moribundity. Those whose memories
are saturated with the fragrance of the
champagne and devilled chicken days may
turn from the picture with tears, and they
are bound to admit that the Kalgoorlie in-
habitant who can to-day afford the humble
beer and the filling bread and cheese is doing
not so badly. If there is any town
in the Commonwealth where house rents are
lower than they are in Kalgoorlie, that town
is deserving of profound pity. The high-
collar official in the Town Hall who used to
write out permits for new buildings has
gone on very extended leave, and if there
are any carpenters and bricklayers left it is
because they can’t raise the railway fare to
get out of it, Gent. One is compulsorily
honest, and of the small army of commission
snatchers there aren’t sufficient left to form a
nucleus crew for a bumboat. The paper
which used to represent Labor m Labor s
Westralian headquarters has migrated to
Perth and taken what promises to be a lease
of vigorous life. The big drapery folk have
either closed up fob good or have opened shops
in Perth, to pass the time profitably until
prosperity hits the Old Camp once more.
And the pubs—ye eods ! The pubs ! -Ihey
are the only bits of humor in the town. Ihe
licensees go in and out in a swift procession,
and if a man is seen entering a saloon-bar it
is even betting whether he is a cash customer
or only the new licensee. When Bill. comes
in with a cheque from somewhere in the
Mulga, and at daybreak breasts the bar at
which he loaded up last night, looking for a
free drink ftom the jovial landlord of a few
hours ago, h'e finds a total stranger at the
beer-pump. And this stranger scornfully
requests him to go where he got drunk, un-
less he desires to be shifted by a John llor.
The miners themselves have become tame and
subdued. About Christmas last the unions
announced that on the first day of May they
intended to give the mine-owners and specu-
lators the shock of their lives. Well, the
day named has come and gone and. what has
happened? A bommittee of the unions inter-
ested has btought in a report to the effect
that things may bfe allowed to gb on as they
are, that the times are inopportune, and; so
far as non-unionists are concerned, members
of Unions are to wrestle in prayer with the
unbeliever, and lead him gently by the ear
to the union booking office. The fighting
unions, in fact; are face to face with the
prevailing decay, and they don’t quite see
how they can shift it. They ate perfectly
well aware that 75 pet cent, of the mines on
the belt are living from hand to mouth and
are so weak from warit of nourishment that
a rude jolt would send them into the land
of slumber for ever. So far as the few
mines still paying are concerned, there is not
one which is not in a position to calculate
with tolerable exactness the time at which its
last ton of dirt will be raised. But all this
does not justify any assumption that Kal-
goorlie will shortly be wiped out. and become
mere heaps of old iron, old bricks, splintered
wood and beef and jan cans. Far from it. Kal-
goorlie is the natural centre and hub of a
huge auriferous country, and is already be-
ginning to realise her ambition as a great
commercial market place. When the out-
back miner wants a holiday he as seldom
takes it in Perth as the coastal farmer does
his in Kalgoorlie. The miner regards Kal-
goorlie as the king-pin in his industry, and
it is to it he comes with his little cheque.
He would sooner pay sixpence in Kalgoorlie
for a long sleever and meet his pals, whose
interests are his interests, than he would pay
threepence for his moisture in Perth, with
the big chance of meeting nothing more
friendly than toughs and confidence men.
The back country is going ahead, and every
wa.vback prospector and dryblower is an asset
to Kalgoorlie. The trans-Australian rail-
way is a matter of the near future, and there
is nothing more certain than that the big
railway workshops of the W.A. end will be
at Kalgoorlie, and that will make for steady
prosperity. The State Government has
brought in a Pill to fill in the blank place
between Ksperance and Norseman with rails,
and Kalgoorlie is the natural market for the
produce of the big farming district which
this route will open up. Stock will pasture
along the national trunk line, and for it, too,
Kalgoorlie is the market and distributing
centre. In short, however depressed the
Old Camp is to-day, it possesses hopes fore-
shadowing a future which, if not so errati-
cally coruscating as the past, will be solid
and lasting, and keep its name permanently
in large type on the map of the continent. —

More Superannuation Arrangements.
Dear Bulletin, —N.S.W. State civil ser-
vants are waiting with anxiety to know the
details of Premier Holman’s promised super-
annuation scheme, and to find out who will
steal the money this time. In the mode-
rately long ago there was a fairly honest
superannuation fund to which public ser-
vants contributed under compulsion. Then
it was resolved to reduce the tariff so that
the country might import more and employ
fewer people in local manufactures. A rush
of impecuniosity came upon the Treasury,
and the civil service was cut down whole-
sale in order to save money. A lot of the
sacked were entitled to retiring allowances,
which fact made a difficulty, for the Govern-
ment was busy manufacturing a surplus by
charging a lot of this year’s public debt
interest to next year amid the applause of
the S. M. Herald and Telegraph, and it
hated to have its surplus disturbed. So
a great deal of the civil servants’ pension
fund—contributed by themselves under com-
pulsion—was used to pay retiring allow-
ances. It was butchered to make a surplus.
Then the fact was widely announced that
the fund had gone bankrupt on a gigantic
scale. It wasn’t announced, widely or other-
wise, that the Government would stand by. it
and make good the loss. A panic set in.
Many civil servants regarded their pensions
as lost and the money they were still paying
into the fund ds lost also. They Wete. will-
ing to accept almost any terms. Finally
this offer was made to them: They were to
cease paying into the fund. They were to
forfeit their pensions. The money they had
actually paid in was to be credited to them
without any back interest, and held up or
prigged or hypothecated till they left the
service or died. Between the date of, this
arrangement and the retirement or death
the amount actually paid in was to earn 6
per cent, simple interest. Three per cent,
is mighty little —much less than the Govern-
ment can borrow for, but then .this wasnt
borrowing but bushranging. And whereas d
per cent, simple interest on fIOQ for 36
years is £9O, 3 per cent, compound interest
is £142. The difference was more bush-
ranging. And when .men left the State sei-
v,icc, not through death or old age, but
through transfer to the .Federal authority,
the old State geni.uses still hung on to then-
money and refused to settle the old account.
If there is to be a new Civil Service Super-
annuation Fund in the Ma State the exact
nature of the. robbery ought, to. be specified
in advance. Brigandage and piracy on the
high seas shouldn’t be sprung suddenly on a
sedentary community whose nerves are none
of the best.—Yours, etc., Henry Horse-
collar.
The N.S.W. Government proposes tb estab;
lish a State Fire Insurance Office, and Chief
Secretary Gann got the first beading
of the Bill through the Assembly last
week. Wade, of course, attacked it
as ah interference with Private Entel-
prise, and alleged that the Maoriland
precedent was no precedent at all, because
the private cos. in M.E. had formed a com-
bine. As a matter of fact there was no
more of a combine in the Shivery Islands
than there is in Australia. They don t
call it a combine, of course; they call it a
tariff, and there isn’t a single non-tantt
office hereabouts. Not only are rates fixed
absolutely, but the combine decides how
many agents a co. shall have in a town,
and when a member reckons he has struck
a new idea, the combine decides whether
he shall be allowed to work it. If he goes
ahead first he is liable to be brought to
reason with a fine —as one was lately, lliat
is no more and no less than the M.B. com-
bine amounted to; so Wade falls through
the bottom of his own busted argument.

“Black Swan” ; With his usual happy smile
Westralian Premier Scaddan laid on the
table of the Assembly one day recently the
accounts of the State steamship service for
the year ending 30th June, 1913. The fact
that the balance-sheet is just a year overdue
doesn’t worry Scaddan any more than do
the cold-blooded comments of a prying
Auditor-General. From the document it
appears that the value of the fleet, in tle
Government books, is £97,001, and the loss
on the working of the vessels up to the dam
named is set down at £22,813. From the
financial statement of the Auditor-General
for the year ending 30th June, 1914, pre-
sented to the Assembly a few days after the
belated sheet, it is gathered that the steamers
are pursuing their disastrous course, the mss
on the year’s transactions being £19,256. The
figures for another of the State enterprises
are even more disheartening, and when Scad-
dan saw them his smile broadened consider-
ably. The State Implement Works, it now
appears, exhibit a deficit of £41,186 for the
year, and no reason is assigned, nor is any
prospect of improvement foreshadowed.
Even the State hotels have not experienced
the estimated thirst. They were expected
to produce an income of £46,000; as a mat-
ter of fact they took only £32,562, and as
they spent £30,321, they can hardly be said
to be doing much for the deficit. The theory
of State trading is right enough, but a great
deal depends on whether State enterprises
are used honestly to make money for the
State, or are employed by a process of politi-
cal corruption to find jobs for a quite un-
necessary number of supporters of the gang
in office. In other words, a State steam-
ship enterprise depends on the management,
just as does a private enterprise.

Undeterred by the fate of the dredges Man-
chester and Poseidon, lost at sea with all
hands, the Sydney Harbor Trust Commis-
sioners have arranged to import three har-
bor deepeners, picked up cheap at Rangoon.
These are named the Seagull, the Swallow
and the Curlew. The first-named has
arrived safely, but the others have yet to
gamble on the face of the waters with D.
Jones, the party who recently went aboard
another of the Sydney Harbor Trust’s for-
eign purchases and nailed the sign of the
coffin on the mainmast. Wonderful is the
fetich of the cheap, imported article, which
keeps many local artisans out of work,
drowns several others, throws their wives and
children on the State, and frequently doesn t
turn up to attempt to meet the bill. In
fact, about the most expensive luxury this
long-suffering country knows is the cheap,
imported dredge.
The shriek of the expiring alderman is one
of the ordinary sounds of Sydney. Sub-
urban councils now mostly realise that a
Greater Sydney is inevitable; nevertheless
the aldermen are determined to go out mak-
ing noises like frogs that have been trodden
on. Those of Glebe have given the key-
note ; and these days, when a suburban
council meets, the business of most import-
ance is the consideration of a circular letter
from the Council of the Place Where the
Smells Come From, inviting co-operation in
resisting the Greater Sydney proposals.
Then does Alderman Mugwump howl dis-
mally about the muddlement of the future,
while Alderman Guff shrieks about
tyranny, and Alderman Tripe, declares the
whole scheme to be un-British. But, in
spite of all these threatening disasters, the
suburbs refuse to thrill or boil worth tup-
pence. The fact that the suburbs know
their own disgraceful roads, and have smelt
their own dreadful smells, and have got
tired of listening to 46 different lots of
frogs croaking in 46 distinct council cham-
bers, probablv has something to do with
the refusal of the suburbs to boil or even
bubble.
War and Loans.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Waddell drew a melancholy picture of stag-
nation, consequent upon the closure of the money
market, and declared that any mah who blinked the
possibility was not a statesman.., .When the Pre-
mier made one of his beautiful and able speeches at
Cootamundra he should tell the people how he pro-
posed to raise the money. The Government was not
far from trouble while it was spending nine millions
a year out of loan moneys and he again warned the
Government of the financial Nemesis which would
overtake profligate and improvident financiers on the
Treasury benches. —From N.S.W. Assembly debates.
Keenly regardant as you are, camcrados,
you will probably have observed some-
thing remarkably like a WAR about.
1)0 you know what WAR means? .
Not the two-men-and-a-boy wars of the
Hebrews and the Hittites and the Jebu-
Not "the kindergarten class of wars such As
the Wars of the Roses-, the War of
Jenkins’s Ear, or the war that Don
Bra-cieneacio declares against Senor
Ippolyte of Siluria or Barataria;
Not even the elegant, hysterical,_ modern
wars in Belgravia and in the vicinity of
the capital of the Finest Nation.
Oh dear, no ! „ ,
That is not at all the sort of WAR I refer
I refer to the genuine, thorough, wholesale,
world-encompassing conflict which is
not much farther away than next week
—if so far !
I refer to the WAR that will see Six Great
Powers and a horde of the Powers That
Hardly Count rushing to battle.
The WAR that will upset the modern world,
and throw back much of its boasted
Civilisation about 150 years !
The WAR that in its primary or initial stage
has convulsed finance, commerce and
the glorious Future of a dozen countries
like ours! .
l’he WAR that, without our seeing a foreign
ship of soldier, or hearing one rifle-shot
fired, will bring unimaginable distress

I never fired a gun in my life:
There’s nothing that I can do
To help myself, the kids and the wife—
And I am a young man, too!
When shops close down and the desks are
shut,
I’ll only be in the way !
What sort of a figure do I cut
In this thund’ring world to-day?
There’ll be a gun for the baby son—
If Britain and he should last;
But where is my training and my gun,
Now trouble is coming fast?
Oh, must I issue a High Court writ
And sit by a shot-lashed sea,
And match with powder my lawyer’s wit
On a shore of lunacy !
We were fools, my friends! Let’s still be
fools!
While the tumult sinks and swells,
Let them hear our only fighting tools —
The idiot’s cap and bells!
A High Court writ and a lawyer grim,
And a very frightful Fee,
And we stand on Armageddon’s rim
Equipped as all fools should be.

“The Young Soldier”— his summary:—
When The Bulletin was going to press the rags
and flinders of the military news were still coming
in. Britain, it was alleged, had at last done the
deed, and declared war. Italy, Sweden and Roumania
were standing out. Apparently Germany in its haste
made the same ugly and unconsidered rush which
France made in 1870, when it leaped into the fray
without making quite sure that its then allies,
Austria and Italy, were ready to leap also. If
Kaiser William had toiled and perspired in the
telephone box for another two days before commit-
ting himself against Russia, he might have made
sure that his alleged friends would follow him, but
he lived for the first time up to his title of William
the Sudden, and left his friends behind. They have
now no visible craving to catch up. Australia's
Joseph Cook is also trying to be Sudden, and talks
of sending forth an expeditionary force of 20,000 men.
Fortunately, before Cook’s handful could be
organised and shipped to the scene of action, either
the war would be over or Europe would be insol-
vent. Two Broken Hill mines and some mines else-
where have closed, and dozens of other closures are
impending. Two big Orient steamers have stopped
in friendly ports to await developments. Sydney
Harbor has been closed during the dark hours of
night, and it is reported that the ferry-boats may
soon be prohibited from going past Bradley’s Head,
which will be darned awkward for the fellow who
wants to take his best girl to Manly. Australian
wheat and wool exports are growing precarious by
reason of the enormous cost of marine insurance. The
daily papers have begun to publish information
about the different classes of civilians who are liable
to be called out in a great emergency—beginning
with the unmarried, untrained youth and ending with
the married, father aged 60. Australia hasn’t begun
to see war on the far horizon yet. Still it is
getting a heap of excitement. Among other things it
has seen the German liners warned off the Australian
coast, and it has begun to sing the “Marseillaise.”
Amid all these frenzies and possibilities the N.S.W.
Government is still blewing loan money on its Con-
servatorium of Music.

Randolph Bedford’s reply (R. Bedford
lias his present postal address at The
Bulletin office, 214 George-street, Syd-
ney) :
Mr. Teesdale Smith’s alleged reply (B. 30/7/’l4)
disproves all that I didn’t say, and leaves the essen-
tials of my charges unanswered. The double dissolu-
tion did suppress the Teesdale Smith inquiry, and
Teesdale Smith’s desire for publicity at even such
a cost as £lOOO has nothing to do with the work
of a Royal Commission or its automatic death. The
wild offer of £lOOO prompts me to ask to whom
Mr. T. Smith offered the money—to J. Cook or to
the Commission or to K. O’Malley? I hold no brief
for the Castles machine, but I do hold a brief
against J. Cook and W. Kelly, who gave T. Smith
a non-competitive contract. I did not say that the
Castles machine was thrown out of commission for T.
Smith, but I did say that, after having done 22,000 or
so cubic yards of track-forming at less than 3d. a yard,
it was not repaired as it should have been, and the
highly fortunate T. Smith got a muck-shifting con-
tract at higher rates. I did not say that the
machine was thrown out on T. Smith’s account, but
it pleases T. Smith to obscure the issue by implying
so. My figures came from the official replies of the
Home Affairs Department to Fred Bamford’s ques-
tions in the House of Reps., and as Mr. T. Smith
seems under the impression that he is a public bene-
factor I hereby give him the figures again. The
Castles machine and day labor cost 2 2-3 d. per cub.
yard. T. Smith’s contract was —for cuttings 4s. 6d.
a yard and for banks 2s. 6d., material from the
cuttings to be let into the embankments for 1J
chains from the mouth of such cuts. That, in itself,
was bad enough, but not bad enough for the toy
Minister of a fool Department, and the liighly-
patriotic T. Smith. T. Smith has been paid, not
4s. 6d. a yard for banks made of spoil from cut-
tings, but 4s. 6d. and 2s. 6d., or 7s. a yard, an
astounding variation of the original terms of the
contract. The contract now is for 107,279 cub. yards
of cutting at 4s. 6d. —a total of £24,137 —and
134,744 cub. yards of banks at 2s. 6d. —totalling
£16,843; a grand total of £40,980. The correct
figures would be 107,279 yards at 4s. 6d.= £24,137
and 27,465 yards (the difference in the yardage
of cuttings and banks) at 2s. 6d. —a total of
£27,570 instead of £40,980. Mr. T. Smith is
hereby exhorted to stick to the highly lucrative
game of muck-shifting. Whenever he takes up a
pen he cuts himself. I further advise him not to
offer that £ICOO so loudly, lest I call his bluff
myself.

Fanatics of the Freetrade variety dredge
satisfaction out of some queer ash-pits.
Recently one W. E. Macklin, who has spent
many years in China, was entertained by a
small and infrequent Sydney body, which
calls itself the N.S.W. Freetrade and Land
Values League; and he made that curious
institution feel quite proud. He told it that
Freetrade was the fixed faith of China; and
the works of Mencius, a Chow who flourished
before clothes were worn in Britain, showed
that it always had been China’s idea of the
right way to achieve national greatness.
The quaint Freetrade League is evidently
so satisfied with the progress China has
made in a thousand years that it hugged
Mencius as a long-lost brother, and gave
him three cheers to go on with.

bearing on Federal politics—Harold Mercer,

In these times of juggling with European
news, and wonderment as to where the
next loan is to come from, the Mysterious
is on a boom. Hence the season of Le Roy,
i alma and Bosco at the Palace (Sydney)
should be profitable to all concerned. The
show deserves to prosper. Le Roy has pro-
vided something new in necromancy. Many
of the tricks that were most popular when
the combination was at the Tivoli, nine years
ago,_ such as Bosco’s joyous muddle in re-
placing the heads of a decapitated hen and
duck, were repeated on Saturday night, and
others have.been added. The principal illu-
sion, in which an early Christian flapper is
thrown into the lions’ den by the Emperor
Nero (he had a hasty temper with reluctant
flappers, but was a fairly good poet and often
contributed to The Bulletin’s Christmas
number) is excellently presented. It is a
show in itself, except that Talma (the
flapper) can’t act for nuts, and dresses for
the part of the meek and lowly virgin in dia-
mond hair-clusters and other revue-girl
accessories. Apparently Talma believes
she has been given a mission to improve her
partners’ work by bright and airy business
generally. The mission is sound, but the
business is bankrupt. The supporting vau-
devillains help to make up an entertainment
worth booking. Any night during the next
couple of weeks will do.
“The Girl in the Taxi” opens at Her
Majesty s (Sydney) on Saturday night next,
-the Girl has now been in almost every
environment that the dramatist can imagine.
She has been in the Train. She has been in
. has been behind the scenes at
the Gaiety. She has grown up and been
the Worst Homan in London. She has fre-
quently been in a sinking ship. She has been
m a state of spiritual exaltation, and also
in the coffin, as witness the lamentable case
of Little Eva. Now if somebody would write
the Girl m the Bath the list might be about
complete.
Remarkable is the popular success of the
hist essay ot the Australian Opera League
Its premiere on Monday, at the Sydney Re-
pertory Theatre—now comfortably re-
seated, provided with private boxes, a new
and artistic curtain, and accommodation for
a large orchestra —attracted a huge and en-
thusiastic audience. The Australian drama
began sporadically in three cities, with
“BUNTY PULLS
THE STRINGS”
(SYDNEY ROYAL).
Weelum at the plate
modest aims and modest means and tenta-
tive support; but the Australian Opera
springs fully grown from untilled soil. Two
miniature "grand” operas are presented in
the six nights' season, Fritz Hart’s “Pier-
rette” and Alfred Hill’s “Giovanni,” the
former in one act and the latter in three,
and both, it is regrettably noted, un-Austra-
lian in theme. “Pierrette’ tells the story, in
four characters, of the return of Pierrot
and Pierrette to the garden of convention,
the reception of the girl by her relatives, her
renunciation of Pierrot, the discovery that
their mutual love is deeper than they had
thought, and the consequent second elope-
ment of Pierrette. In order to get the fan-
tastic atmosphere, the figures of the uncle
and aunt are made unsympathetic. The
libretto is commonplace and essentially dra-
matic ; but the musical treatment is bril-
liant. Fritz Hart belongs to the ultra-
modern school. His melodic themes are
dexterously interwoven in the continuous
texture of his musical narrative; and the
score calls for close attention on the part
of artists, orchestra and audience. An
obvious vagueness of intention is observ-
able in the orchestration, especially in the
nocturne interlude played to an empty
stage. Such a nocturne should hold its own
though deprived of dramatic action, yet it
proves too slight to excuse its length. Rut
there is an overbrimming sense of humor,
gaiety, tenderness and rhythm in the whole
opera. A quartette at the supper table is
infectiously humorous, and the Pierrette
gay duet is repeated with taking abandon.
Fritz Hart fails only in the expression of
the deepest dramatic effects, though rightly
he has avoided as much as possible this
weakness by the choice of so slight a theme.
Miss Elsa Warmann’s robust voice is equal
to all the demands of the composer, and her
appearance and acting are especially com-
mendable. Reginald Roberts makes a taking
Pierrot. The uncle, Frederic R. Collier, is
admirably in place.
“BUNTY PULLS THE STRINGS."
Rab Big-gar declares war on his father, and
refuses to open the ham shop.
“Giovanni” is the story of the village
sculptor youth who leaves his playmate and
mother to win fame in his art and the inter-
est of Princess Violetta. Confronted with
the choice of returning to his dying mother
or remaining in the Princess’s toils and
winning new fame as a sculptor, Giovanni
takes the easier way. He wins his fame,
but finds that the Princess was but playing
with him. He smashes his statue and is
about to shoot himself when Amina, his vil-
lage playmate, enters his studio and brings
about the conventional happy ending. The
music is full of pure melody, with the num-
bers complete in themselves, though there
are many leading motifs, including, it may
be mentioned, a “cow” motive. Unlike
“Pierrette,” this opera calls for highly
dramatic effects, and herein Alfred Hill in
the last act proves wanting. But the humor
and the melodic charm of “Giovanni” are
entrancing. It is unnecessary to single out
any number for special mention: the
melody ripples through every act. William
Everard had to take the part of Giovanni at
short notice, and though his voice does not
ring true in the higher passages, in acting
he more than capably fills the part.
Florence Young’s splendid voice is finely
telling in the part of the Princess. Muriel
Barton is admirably placed as Giovanni’s
mother, and Dulcie Huxtable is sweetly in-
effective in the part of Amina. T. Courtney
Hood and F. Perc. Mitchell acouit them-
selves well, the latter’s doubled part of
Padre and Porter affording his fine voice
admirable chances. The beautiful setting
of “Giovanni” is due to the brush of Souter.

As it is impossible to prophesy, all that
this paper commits itself to is the adver-
tised statement that “Madame X ” intends
at present to stay at the Sydney Criterion.
The Bulletin is anxiously awaiting con-
firmation of the report that, at midnight on
Sunday, Colonel Beaumont Smith mounted
the box office at the Adelphi Theatre, Syd-
ney, with a revolver in each hand and a
dagger in the other, and addressed an
excited crowd of 300,000. In the course of
an impassioned speech he declared that “The
Barrier” was doing excellent business, and
that he would answer only to himself and
Lieutenant Marcus for what had happened.
Consols immediately rose to 136, and the
Bank of England announced a sale of cash
at under cost price.
The Buckler season at Sydney Little
Theatre will close on Saturday evening.
Then a gloom will fall on the city, as it
does on the bush township when Alderman
Boggs dies, and all the population follows
the funeral in a spring-cart on a wet Sun-
day, and an inscription is put above the
dust saying that the gaiety of nations has
been blown out.

At the Sydney Repertory Theatre, on
July 28, the Lotus Players presented four
one-act Australian plays. “Way Out Back,”
by Mrs. C. Peterkin, was not so bad as
“Venette the Dancer,” by V. Haldane-
Coward ; though neither play could show
any possible reason for its existence.
“Wattle Tree Farm,” by Alfred Hill, con-
firmed the pleasant impression given at its
first performance a few weeks ago. But
‘Gerties Glad Eye,” a real Australian
comedy by J. Clarence Lee, was an up-
roarious and well-deserved triumph. This
playlet has been, produced by amateur organi-
sations many times; and each time it has
been a ln the character of
Maud .Mary, a ten-year old Austra-
lian kid, delightfully played by Essie
Patterson, the author has made a
genuine contribution to the Australian
stage. . Some day some Australian manager
will discover the money-making possibilities
of Maud Mary.

There is good business at the National
Amphitheatre (Sydney), and good reason

Stavordales and the sharpshooteragettes,
Misses Clinton and Beatrice.
He was a libelmonger who stated that
the Imperial Salon de Tango Hug had re-
moved from William-street, Sydney. Also,
his grandmother inhabited a peanut grove.
The music boom in Adelaide continues.
Leonard Borwick has been interpreting
Chopin at the Town Hall, caressing the piano
as if he loved it and were having a qui'et
talk with it. Harold Bauer has now arrived,
with his more strenuous methods, for a series
of concerts. The Anderson co. holds the
Royal with melodrama. “The French Spy”
is good of its kind, and gets some fine acting;
so does “The Face,” which has made an
unexpected reappearance at the Window,
and deserves to have something besides
bouquets thrown at it. Vaude and Verne
are back at the King’s r unlike most other
patter pairs, they generally contrive to have
something new to say. Fields still drops
bricks and plays weird billiards; Talleur
Andrews has a delightful ballad, “Dream
Girl” ; the Four Vagabonds harmonise; and
Warren, St. Leon and the Weldons do ath-
letic turns. The King’s has a good bill, too,
with the gymnastic Lamys, Hayes and Rives
the very-wet Neptuna, and “Juno Salmo.”
Viewed in the light of other days, when
competition was keen and the combine was
unborn, the present revival of “A Royal
Divorce” at Melbourne Royal seems rather
cheap and tawdry. The brilliant “Court”
that Nap. summons to his divorce proceed-
ings is represented by one Talleyrand, two
or three marshals and four ladies in sub-
urban splendor, who carry their arms un-
comfortably. Again, when he boards 11.M.5.
Northumberland to meet a job lot of British
admirals, the force drawn up in honor of
the captive consists of eight unimpressive
seamen and six marines. There is more
smoke and noise than pomp and glory about
the stage setting of this inopportune re-
minder of France’s bygone politics. Yet
in a measure the improved acting of certain
of the principal characters atones for scenic
shortcomings. Irene Browne, less man-
nered in her utterance than of yore, makes
Josephine a dignified and interesting sufferer.
Edward O’Neil is good in his part; likewise
Bentley. Victor is also satisfactory, and
Lizette Parkes is easily the best of the
Stephanies up to date. As for Julius
Knight, the monotonous heaviness of his
voice is forgiven for the sake of his fine
Napoleonic make-up, his rich assortment of
poses and his occasional flashes of power.
Why isn’t there an influential movement
towards working up a testimonial perform-
ance on behalf of invalided Harrie Ireland,
the tall Bland Holtian actress with the
glorious auburn hair? Harrie has had the
cruellest luck. She was forced to leave the
stage because of her “rheumatism,” as it
appeared to be, and for a while she had fair
prospects of making a do of the confectionery
shop in the St. Kilda Theatre building. She
ran the business and her friends and her
theatrical reputation were helping it along,
Avhat time her “rheumatic” troubles were
getting beyond endurance. She was advised
to go to a masseuse for treatment, and the
masseuse discovered something wrong with
her hip bone. It is now supposed that a
displacement of the bone had caused her to
adopt unnatural means of preserving her
“A ROYAL DIVORCE.”

ings and other false symptoms of rheuma-
tism. On this theory Dr. Mackenzie has
been lately treating poor Harrie, and she is
having a time of agony, with her back on a
very hard bed and her limbs in plaster of

pital she will be taken to the home of her
married sister Daisy, and at the end of the

“The Mikado,” at Her Majesty’s (Melb.),
is treated in a broad-comedy spirit by the
Gilbert and Sullivan co., and for
12 nights their representation of the quaintly
libellous Jap. opera will be more popular
than artistic. Sometimes the fooling is per-
mitted the freedom of a panto., and nobody,
save Arnold, as Pish Tush, follows the rules
of Japanese travesty. Even the facial dis-
guises and the mincing methods of tradi-
tional impersonations are wanting in Ruth
Lincoln and Dorothy Vane, neither of whom
puts any heathen charm into her appear-
ance. McKeown, as Nanki Poo, suggests
a plump female person with her hair
screwed up for action in the domestic clean-
ing way; Ivavanagh is a fat, genial Pooh
Bah; and Wallen’s idea of Ko-Ko is a
hybrid humorist who accepts his sentence of
lingering death as a harmless joke. In this
atmosphere of irresponsibility the arrival
of the Mikado (Wilson) and Katisha
(Ethel Morrison) goes for less than usual.
They strike no terror to anybody’s soul :
moreover, the modern, easy-going style of
the ruling autocrat would invite familiarity
under any circumstances. Take it alto-
gether the opera as produced at Her
Majesty’s seems a milder musical attraction
and a less Gilbertian entertainment than it
has usually been in the past The per-
formance breaks no records, but is bright
enough to ensure good business for its
allotted span of two weeks.
“The Burglar and The Lady,” staged at
Melbourne Princess’s on Saturday night,
disclosed Allen Doone as a gentle, calf-
bound edition of Raffles, cracking cribs in
defiance of Sherlock Holmes and his gloomy
men. Doone inserts himself into a bank
and an impressive private residence, and each
time his enterprise is a scientific success.
Holmes is so expert in misconstruing the
obvious that the burglar’s triumph is a fore-
gone conclusion, and Doone is so conscious of
the undetective’s inferiority that he doesn’t
hesitate to cheek Mr. Holmes in public, and
also halt on a risky midnight “job” to warble
irrelevantly of Erin, or burble of love to the
first damsel that arrests his roving fancy.
Probably it is not so much the lady’s
influence as Holmes’s inability to “pinch”
Raffles that eventually forces the latter to
reformation. Anyhow, by the third act he
tires of being the pride of the cracksman’s
profesh. and when this writer left him

Allen Doone plays Raffles in his soft, inde-

shortcomings of a character that doesn’t
allow of more than one tribute to the sham-
rock per night. Onslow Edgeworth vainly
tries to make S. Holmes interesting by
theorising audibly and scowling dreadfully.
Clive Farnliam, as the Rev. Banfield, is a
credit to the cloth. Miss Keeley appears as
Norma Grey, who turns Raffles’s thoughts
to blameless pursuits. Miss Bashford
inhabits the garments of a German nurse-
girl ; and others are cast for comparatively
minor parts. The scenery, by J. S. Mann,
becomes effective only towards the conclu-
sion.
At Melbourne King’s the congregation will
join for two more nichts in the chorus of
Harry Lauder’s beautiful, intemperance
hymn. When it has deoched and dorised
on Friday the Scawtch comedian will wish
Melbourne guid-bye and gang awa. The.
theatre, having got into kilts, as it were,
during the brief Lauder season, will be
fully prepared to receive the Graham Moffat
co. in “Bunty Pulls the Strings.” The
comedy of tartan character, interpreted by
Scottish players, comes due on Saturday,
and a lot of people whose name is not neces-
sarily McTavish are prepared to take Bunty
on her established reputation.
At Melbourne Opera House the last nights
of Ada Re*eve (who concludes her strenu-
.ously clever efforts this Thursday) have
been saddened by the arrival of Baroness
D’Astreel and her “marvellous tenor.” The
Baroness’s title to distinction doesn’t hold
good in vaudeville, and the tenor’s marvel-
lousness ■ fills one with the wrong sort of
astonishment. Damond, the violinist, is a
welcome newcomer. The incidental patter

drawing, and the other people continue to

PENZANCE .”
Matters of imminent interest at Mel-
bourne Auditorium are two more Mischa
Elman concerts, due on Saturday and Mon-
day next. Just now, however, a violinist
on a public platform is rather remindful
of the late unlamented Nero, who fiddled
when the political situation was ablaze.
Walter E. Deaves and Co., with their sot
of Merry Mannikins, were the most striking
of the newcomers at Melbourne Bijou on
Saturday. The smart, unusual dances of
the Small family earned an uproarious vote
of confidence, and the act of the Lyrical
Four, singers and instrumentalists, was
sufficient apology for their inclusion on the
bill. All but one of the Stagpooles continue
to be as superfluous as before, and to give a
martial tint to the programme. Gardner’s
pups of the bulldog breed are reappearing
for a space.
Antony and Cleopatra finished their inn-
ings at West’s Melbourne premises on
Saturday. This week West is filming “Sixty
Years a Queen,” a stiff and solemn record of
the late Victoria’s reign, issued for the
benefit of the aged and uninformed.
For one day of the year Bruce Smith
holds Britain up as a glorious example and
on the other 364 days he throws mud at it.
That Australia should pay for its Fleet out
of current revenue is, he assures his con-
stituents, quite idiotic —nobody but the
crude, ignorant and unjust Labor party
would think of it. Yet the dear old Mother-
land, which has been piling up its Navy
during recent years, instead of going deeper
into debt to do it. has actually been paying
off debt (mostly incurred •in war-time) as
follows: —
1904 .. .. £770,778,762
1909 . . . . 711,475,865
1914 .. .. 661,473,765
It’s a terrible mistake, no doubt, not to
get so heavily in debt in peace that there’s
nothing left to borrow in war-time; still,
Britain will probably go along in its crude,
ignorant and unjust old way, and disregard
Bruce Smith, disgraceful and all as that may
be.
[S. H. Prior, Bulletin Office, Georgc-street, Sydney.]
“H.H.”: I would like to know how the
wretched, unwholesome “afternoon shift,”
which forces men to try to snatch a frag-
ment of sleep amid the glare and clatter of
day, came to creep into the coal-mining in-
dustry. It is necessary on ships and long-
distance trains, and it is often essential on
wharves if any kind of a time-table is to be
adhered to. But it seems to me that the
man who digs up fuel from the earth, and
the man who digs up potatoes from the
earth, and the person who digs down fuel
from the trees are all people with whom
night work is absurd slave-driving. The
poorest case of the three is that for night
work in coal mines. The mine-owner is
tearing up and selling a most valuable asset
that can never be replaced. It doesn’t grow
again like trees and potatoes. Why this
absurd haste to be rid of the asset?
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Kaniva” : Robert Kennedy and his pupils
sang to the Pioneers at their last monthly
meeting in Melbourne. Robert was one of
a talented family who, with father David,
toured Australia and Maoriland in the
early ’7o’s. As Scotch entertainers they
were unrivalled, and they did so well that
they didn’t move on for years. Then three
members of the co., James, Kate and Lizzie,
went to Italy to study music, and were
burned to death in the theatre at Nice on
March 23, 1881.
“The Oldest”: Apropos Allen Doone and
“The Colleen Bawn” (B. 23/7/T4). I think
Henry Edwards was the original Hardress
Cregan in Australia, and C. W. Barry the
Father Tom; likewise, unless memory fails,
Miss Fanny Young (Mrs. G. W. Daniels
and sister to Charles Young) was Anne
Chute. Some time afterwards a company of
amateurs played “Eily O’Connor,” the origi-
nal drama, for the purpose of raising funds
to put a memorial over the grave of Miss
Ellen Mortyn, one of G. V. Brooke’s com-
pany. On that occasion Miss Rosa Dunn
played Eily, and Mr. J. M. Forde Danny
Mann. It brought in enough to place a
memorial over the grave.
“C.”: What with Tith„ Essie Jenyns
Wood, Ellen Terry and a few others, the
thing that was chiefly represented at last
week’s Her Majesty’s (Sydney) matinee
was Age. Testiness was inevitably a fea-
ture of the proceedings. During rehearsals
a lady participator took exception to the
methods of one of the actors, Said he,
loftily: “Madame, at _ this stage I can
scarcely require correction. I have been 60
years on the stage.” “I should have thought
you had been 80 years on it,” she riposted,
and it was heartily agreed that the drinks
were on him. When the race-conscious G.-G.
Ferguson “went behind” after the show, by
the way, the first question he asked was,
“Where are the Bunties?” You could have
knocked some of the octogenarian loyalists
down with a meat-axe, so scandalised were
they at this callous disregard of the rights
of eld.
“Monkbarns” : Bunty sets me going on the
development of the Scot on the stage. Shaks-
peare and the Elizabethan dramatists had
very limited ideas about the extent to which
the characteristics of McParritch might
be wrought. Macklin was the first to de-
velop rich Scotch character, with Sir Pert-
inax Macsycophant, in “The Man of the
World,” and Sir Archy Mac Sarcasm in
“Love a La Mode.” After Burns had made
his impression on the world without, Scott
came with a glory of illumination, which
reached the stage in adaptations of “Rob
Roy,” “Guy Mannering,” “The Antiquary,”
“Heart of Midlothian,” and nearly all his
novels. Thenceforward the Scot trod the
planks familiarly. Macklin acted well up
to 90 years old, and lived to be 100, so they
say. He restored the true Shylock—“the
Jew that Shakspeare drew.” Yet it is re-
markable that the carrotty-headed, low-
comic Shylock appears to be the type which
Shakspeare allowed upon the stage. Scorn-
fully he may have foreseen even such a
development as Irving’s almost-chivalric
impersonation of a wronged man. Fanny.
Kemble said: “If Shakspeare saw Irving he
would re-write the play.” However, the
Shylocks of Beerbolim Tree and Asche. re-
vert to the vulgar. Tree’s is just a variant
upon his Fagin. The actor must mould
the part to his own personality. Incident-
ally, what a perfect Shylock was lost in
General Booth! On second thoughts, was
he lost —except to the stage?
“Rosna” : The death of Teddy Payne, who
has played at George Edwardes’s Gaiety
for 21 years past, removes one of
London’s best-known comedians. Payne
never changed his make-up and never
changed his management —two facts that
made a strong appeal to the average unpro-
gressive Britisher. He stood five feet four
and boasted of being the tallest man of his
family, and the ugliest.
“Keridon” : Yosi Matsumoto, the Japanese
actor of the Niblo co., saw the dress
rehearsal of “The Mikado.” Asked his
opinion of the show, he gave it promptly.
“The ladies had their kimonos folded wrong
way across front. That way was for
funerals. Of course, the Japanese of the
opera were hundreds of years ago. All
officials wear uniforms European style now.
Your executioner he make Yosi smile. No
kill now with swords. Man stands on plat-
form. Trapdoor opens. He falls and spoils
his neck. x\.nd Mr. Poo Bah he work too
much. Not like that now. The acting of
the ladies was most wrong. In Japan the
men do not kneel to ladies. Ladies kneel
to men. But this is opera style, why not i
Ladies use handkerchiefs when they cry in
the play. Japanese style is the large sleeve
to wipe the eye. Still, Yosi enjoy the morn-
ing, thank you.”
Melbourne’s ancient St. George’s Hall
(next to the Theatre Royal), now known
as Hoyt’s Picture Palace, will soon be pulled
to pieces, and a new picture theatre and a
shop or two will arise on the site of the
building where nigger minstrelsy and vaude-
ville flourished in the long ago. Hoyt’s
Ltd. have got a long lease of the ground,
which extends way back to Little Bourke-
street. The theatre in view, designed by
William Pitt, is to seat 2500 people. Dur-
ing the alterations business will be carried
on at the big hippodromic hall in Wirths’
Park, lately vacated by Spencer, and mean-
while, ere the old Bourke-strect building is
demolished, Hoyt’s will run pictures at both
places. Hoyt is the nom-de-kinematograpli
of dentist Arthur Russell, who started the
picture spec, on his own and subsequently
formed himself into a co. with £40,000
capital.
“Kaniva”: Tom Ford, recently dead in
Sydney, was for a long term an identity in
Melbourne. His step-father, W. H. Ford,
ran a theatrical costumier’s business, and
Tom was his right-hand man. Ford, sen.,
was dresser to G. Y. Brooke, who was very
partial to young Ford. The latter was a
good vocalist and banjoist. A few years ago
he returned to his native land, and there
snuffed out. He had a sister, Maggie, well
known on the stage, now resident in Syd-
ney, and better known as Mrs. Allan Hamil-
ton. W. H. Ford may be safely called the
father of the- stage, as some 80 years ago he
was appearing in an act with his parents,
who were members of Ducrow’s famous
equestrian company in London. He also
strutted his hour or so upon the stage, run-
ning shows in N.S.W. and Queensland as
far back as 60 years ago. He claims to
have given Sliiel Barry (Andy Donohue)
his first start, and was costumier to Wm.
Saurin Lyster through most of his operatic
campaign.' Although hurrying on to his
90tli year W.H.F. still enjoys fair health.
“Theorbo” : “Pirates of Penzance” had a
queer kick-off. It was first given at the
little Bijou Theatre
at Paignton, Torquay
(England), on De-
cember 30, 1879. Gil-
bert, Sullivan and
Carte were in New
York, where they
staged it next day.
They had decided on
a simultaneous Eng-
lish production; but
as Mrs. Carte only
got the words and
music from them on
December 29, a Lon-
don performance was
out of the question.
So she hurriedly or-
ganised the little
rural show, the per-
formers reading then-
parts in the costumes
of “11.M.5. Pina-
fore,” which was
running there.. Fed-
erici, who died on
the Melbourne stage,
was the . original
Pirate King at
Paignton, while
Mansfield, afterwards
famed in the United
States- (but an Eng-
lish actor, like
Sothern) was Gen-
eral Stanley. He
was then compara-
tively obscure. The
first regular English
performance came
along at the London
Opera Comique in
THE LATE
HARRY DIVER.
April, 1880, with Grossmith as Stanley and
Marion Hood as Mabel.
“Isaac Mclke”: Another calamitous im-
ported idea seems to be getting a grip here.
This is the rush certain managers make to
secure the services of anybody who, for some
reason or none at all, gains a little notoriety.
Now touring in a vaudeville company in
Westralia is the man who was arrested on a-,
liner at Colombo not long ago, and brought
back to stand trial in connection with an-
alleged criminal assault upon an ex-barmaid'
in a Perth-Fremantle railway carriage. Cer-
tainly the trial was sensational, and unsavory
enough; but surely that is not a sufficient:
reason why the acquitted man should be-
foisted upon a long-suffering public as at
star. Even in London, where the masses-
bow down for at least nine days and worship
anybody who emerges successfully from a
sensational trial, managers have found that
such a turn may be resented. Witness the
case of the artist who figured in a Camden
Town murder a few years ago; or more
recently, that of the girl who, with no assets
other than a brassy face, succeeded in im-
nosing upon a horde of stockbrokers, money-
lenders, etc., to the extent of fifty or sixty
thousand of the best. As music-hall turns
they were both fizzles. So was Mister John-
sing. All the same, some day I am going
to annex the mace, or the public debt, and
thereafter look for some enterprising Yank
to book me risrht away at a fabulous salary.

HOW HE HELD THEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Quoth tiie undent star mummer to one o£ to-day:
“I notice your public don’t sit out the play;
In my time the audience seemed to have brains.
They stayed in their seats, sir, none bolted for
trains!
“Till the very last words of the author I spoke,
Not a soul in the house from the spell e’er awoke.
My acting, dear lad, was magnetic, in fact.
To-day where are they, sir, who really can act?
“Egad, but I held them! I see them there still;
All hypnotised, mesmerised —slaves of my will!
The press would oft say of my great mumming feats:
Tie had all his audience glued to their seats 1’”
The speaker, his face simply glowing with pride,
Paused awhile and the younger pro. slowly replied:
“The audience glued to the seats ! I declare
That’s a very cute method of keeping them there!”

“F.P.C.”: At last, it seems, the British
War Office has got the hang of the prize
rifle-shooting business ; and it is announced
that, on the other side, all prize meetings
must be carried out under Service conditions.
The tremendous change which this implies
may be judged by the comment of an expert
THE INVALID'S DIGNITY.
NURSE (to suffering patient who has been trampled on): “This is the third time you
have been brought here in this condition. Why are you so foolish as to continue
to live with such a brute of a husband? ”
PATIENT: “ What's that got to do with you? It's the business of the likes of you to
attend to the likes of me."
that, “if the King’s were conducted under
purely Service conditions, the chances are
the merest novice would easily win against
a crack shot.” Naturally, then, the change
does not suit the pot-hunters who shoot
under conditions that are.not warlike. Un-
der the conditions they have been used to, the
ranges are carefully cleared, accurately
measured, and each shot is marked. Under
Service conditions shooting would take place
over unmeasured ranges, the country would
be rough, each shot would not be marked,
and five cartridges would be loaded into the
magazine, as against one. Under the present
Defence system, we are keeping two armies,
one that can manoeuvre and can’t shoot, and
one that can shoot and can’t manoeuvre.
What the man from the Bogan wants to know
is why both armies can’t shoot and manoe-
uvre and thus be one army? Plainly it is a
rotten return for the millions we spend when,
in the final result, the novice can beat the
supposed “crack” when the “crack” gets
down to real business.

A recent witness in a Richmond (Vic.)
police court objected bitterly to being termed
an “immigrant.” She hadn’t come there to
be insulted, being a lady, however appear-
ances might be against her, and a respectable
woman into the bargain, and so on. The
hard, cold facts were that she had arrived in
Melbourne from the Cold Land a week before,
and met in Bourke-street a charming lad who
took her to Sandringham. At Sand-
ringham they drunk heartily to one
another’s bright eyes, and then cast
themselves —or mayhap fell—beneath a
ti-tree to rest. When the lady came
to, at five o’clock the next morning, her
gentleman friend had fled. and with
him a diamond-and-ruby gold ring, a gold
cameo ling, a pearl-and-sapphire gold ring, a
gold snake ring, a star brooch and her repu-
tation. In Paris they call the type of man
who puts it across a trusting and affec-
tionate female a “rasta,” and it is regarded
as a term of detested obloquy. But what on
earth is the matter with “immigrant”?
* * * *
“The Oldest Inhabitant” produces another
pub :
An ancient Sydney pub will come under the
hammer within a week or two. This is the River-
view Hotel, on Cook’s River-road. Sixty years ago
it was the Bold Forester, kept by Levi Barden.
Cook’s River-road had then some haughty homes on
it, and some historic beer-pumps. There was a
Pulteney Hotel, kept by George Rose, and a Star
and Garter, kept by Thomas J. Bown, subsequently
distinguished as a fire-fighter. The Duiguids of the
original Commercial Bank lived out that way; so
did F. W. Unwin, the old-time solicitor; William
Fanning, from whose house Huxley, the scientist, got
his wife; Tom Holt; Michael Metcalfe, the early
underwriter; and Win. Savigny, who ran a school,
now historic; Sam 11. Terry; and Talbot, a wool-
broker. Some of the fine old mansions still stand,
huddled up amongst jerry-built cottages and heaps
of brick-dust.
The curious fact was lately men-
tioned in a daily paper that while
Sydney is 50 miles from Gosford
by railway it is 200 miles by road.
Some forgetful cove left a gap of
14 miles in the highway, and the
gap remains to this day. Conse-
quently the foot-traveller is ex-
pected to go round by Newcastle,
Maitland, Wollombi, Wiseman’s
Kerry, etc., and but for the bless-
ing of Providence he might have
to go round by Timbuctoo.
AT THE CLUB.
MAJOR L APITUP: “Haw. I was looking up my family tree yesterday.”
VICTLM: “Bottle tree , I suppose.”
Westralia’s action in handing to Victoria
a sex aberrationist gives a South Australian
parson, J. C. Kirby, a tremendous advertise-
ment for his pet scheme of dealing with such
cases surgically. What is the sense, he asks,
in either flogging, life-long imprisonment or
release with its chance of further ruin for
girl-children?
1 have great respect for the Salvation others, but
by all their prayerful activities they cannot alter the
constitutional pathologic basis of a man’s abnormal
impulses.... The combined Salvation Army and the
whole army of doctors cannot guarantee that the
sex-perversion has been taken out of Bennet.... Max
Nordau says that the erotomaniac stands in the
same position to the other sex as a dipsomaniac does
to intoxicating drink. Something must be done for
the safety of Society... .In Indiana, California and
New York the law in such cases is to asexualise, by
a method, nearly painless, called vasectomy. I have
a little pamphlet from Dr. Shary, of Indiana, the
Government physician. He has operated on 236
cases. There is no expense, he says, to the State,
no sorrow or shame to the friends, and there is no
lifelong imprisonment for the person who suffers
from these moral aberrations. The thing is over in
a few days, and the nrisoner released. Moreover, the
person is released from these fearful impulses during
the rest of his life. This matter is quite distinct
from the general question of the sterilisation of the
feeble-minded, and deals only with those who are
sex-perverts, and who hitherto have been dealt with
as criminals, whereas they should be dealt with as
constitutionally diseased.
Caldwell, a former Adelaide M.P., got on to
the same subject years ago, and made many
converts ; now, with the tremendously ener-
getic Kirby hammering at it, it looks highly
probable that the time is getting ripe for S.
Aus. to take another more-or-less startling
legislative lead.
“10-2-4” : There is a sociable international
soap factory in Sydney. The manager is an
Australian-Britisher, and with him are asso-
ciated two Australians, a Russian and a
Frenchman. They are all excellent friends
and their one desire is to go on quietly mak-
ing soap for Australia. But three great
European Powers have reached out for their
respective men and the useful soap business
is threatened with extinction, while the
soap-makers go away to Europe at tremen-
dous expense, to lie on their stomachs and
shoot for their various homelands. An
Australian artist, who knows and likes them
all, and doesn’t want to lose their company,
is trying to arrange a four-handed duel with
soft-soap in the Australian works, the result
to be cabled to the various European head-
quarters, after peace has been honorably con-
cluded and the place tidied up for the next
day’s business. It would represent a tre-
mendous saving in time, money and hospital
expenses—to say nothing of broken friend-
ships. But the European lunatic asylum
isn’t likely to listen to such well-soaped
reason. At present there are too many
vuns going off for Reason to make herself
heard.
Alberto Terrace, a landmark in Darling-
hurst-road, Sydney, has been sold for £65,000.
The terrace, which consists of IS four-storey
houses, was built by degrees and old John
Solomon. When first completed it was
known as “Solomon’s Glory,” and to be
quite fashionable it was sufficient to rent a
chunk of it. In recent years the well-to-do
have moved their distinguished patronage
from Darlinghurst, and the sign of the Hash
House is over Solomon’s erstwhile pomp.
Nowadays his radiance is reflected from his
descendants—a host in Sydney Jewry.
-X- * * *
“Rule Britannia” : She was the type of
loyal British matron who doesn’t understand
the cables and puts all her eggs on the
British throne—if I may use such a vulgar
expression. The gentleman-caller had been
explaining to the best of his ability the
tangled international trouble, and she had
been giving him a dignified if somewhat
impatient hearing. When at last he had
laid bare the secrets of the diplomatic world
and shown how the leading nations and the
innumerable official figureheads were starting
out to wreck the temple of white- civilisation
and set fire to history, she drew a deep
British breath and remarked severely: “/
suppose King George could stop all this if
he wanted to!”
Melbourne solicitors and amalgams are
deploring a remarkable decline in Supreme
and County Court business. The sort of
litigant who used to risk a half-crown to
gain a shilling, and who usually lost the
two and six proceeds nowadays in the less
expensive way of Petty Sessions. Neverlhe-
less the number of civil cases heard in Petty
Sessions in Victoria is only about 18 per
cent, higher than it was 25 years ago,
whereas the Supreme and County Court
cases have in the same period dwindled down
to one-tentli and one-twentieth of their
former numerosity. Which indicates that
the Melb. lawyers, although they didn’t slay
the goose that laid the golden eggs, have so
scared the bird that she has ceased to be a
prolific layer. But still there is too much
money “earned” by licensed practitioners in
the business which costs the Government so
many thousands a year for the upkeep of
courts and judges. When are litigants and
property buyers and sellers to be supplied
with tfie services of salaried Government
amalgams? When is the Government that
pays the heavy expenses incidental to the
conduct of legal business going to get some
of the profits in part repayment of its ex-
penditure? It is a question which might
very well be hurled at all the lawyer candi-
dates for Parliament in all the 2cates.
QUERY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
T note the latest war scare and the cableman’s
alarms ;
I learn that “stocks are falling,” and that Russia’s
up in arms,
And 1 wonder —yea, by thunder !
What a d —d official blunder,
And troubles “international,”
Most shockingly irrational,
Are thought of by the peasants who are farming on
their farms.
When Austria and Servia are both “upon the brink,”
And Italy is waiting for her mighty ally’s wink,
And France is getting ready
For a plunge into the eddy,
And our Fatmen’s conversations
Are of “foreign complications,”
Then I wonder what the workers in the factories
must think.
When the toffs who rule the people and are sumptu-
ously fed
Extol the Nation’s Glory and the fighters who are
dead ;
When the journals publish leaders
Full of butter for the bleeders,
And talk with great verbosity
Of racial animosity,
The nation’s trouble mostly is the rising price of
bread.
Oh, the masses! When their heroes are “responding
to the call,”
And the stay-at-homes are singing “Let me like a
soldier fall” ;
When the Ministers meet daily,
And the Flag is flying gaily,
And lords and dukes lunatical
Are densely diplomatical,
Oh, the masses, patient asses! Do they ever think
at all?

PURIFIED PETROLEUM AS A HEALIN6
REMEDY FOR DIGESTIVE DISORDERS.
The value of purified petroleum as a healing
remedy for digestive and bowel disorders is
now universally recognised. Unlike animal
or vegetable oils, petroleum passes through
the stomach unchanged, hence its soothing,
lubricating, disinfectant action is exercised
throughout the entire alimentary tract. To
obtain the best results from petroleum, it
should be administered in the form of an
emulsion. In this form, the petroleum is
broken up into minute globules which mingle
freely with the contents of the stomach
and are thus evenly distributed throughout
the digestive area, where the.r soothing,
healing powers are exerted to the fullest
extent.
The original and standard preparation of
petroleum for internal use is Angier s Emul-
sion, which has been largely employed by the
medical profession ever since 1892. The
petroleum in Angier’s Emulsion is purified by
a special process and combined with the
hypophosphites of lime and soda in the form
of a perfect Emulsion that is pleasant to the
palate and acceptable to the most delicate
stomach.
Apart from its soothing, healing properties
Angier’s Emulsion (because of the hypo-
phosphites which it contains) exerts a marked
tonic, invigorating influence, which makes it
of value in a wide variety of disorders. The
medical profession prescribe it extensively not
only for lung troubles and wasting diseases,
but even more largely for gastric catarrh,
gastric ulcer, mucous colitis, nervous dys-
pepsia, chronic constipation and in many
obscure digestive and bowel disorders. Of all

THE SAVING CLAUSE.
“All men are such beasts.”
"Ah, not all of them.”
"Well, all the nice ones.”
The tips-in-lieu-of-wages policy cropped up
at Melbourne Police Court the other day,
when a Y.M.C.A. janitor excused a trifling
theft on the ground that his wages were only
£1 a week. The Y.M.C.A. countered with
the claim that he got “quite a lot
in tips.” What right the Ass. had to take
advantage of the assumed generosity of a
few patrons to grossly sweat an employee it
did not pause to explain.
THE COMEPLIMEET.
JESSIE: “ Please, Auntie , the new lady next door says her compliments, and will you play
very tow, because her husband is extremely musical.'”
A Maoriland murder case 20 years old
was dragged into the limelight again at
Wellington a week or so ago. For about
five years prior to 1895 Minnie Dean carried
on a baby farm at Winton (M.L.), and
during that time slew several infants.
In fact, all the infants committed to
her care disappeared, including one
named Colin Scoullar McLachlan, an
illegitimate child, who had been en-
trusted to her from Oamaru about
1890. In 1895 the law fell like a
leaning tower on Minnie, and she
died suddenly one morning in Inver-
cargill Gaol, which is a cold, wet
place to die in. The father of the
child McLachlan had died in 1894,
and the codicil of his will
left certain moneys to his
illegitimate offspring. This
cash was reserved by the
Public Trustee on the
grounds that the child
might some day be found
alive. There wasn’t suf-
ficient. in the estate to
pay the other legacies in
full, and so the surviving
legatees (both in Scot-
land) recently applied to
have the amount reserved
for the youngster paid to
them. It was pointed out
to the Judge that no one
could prove that the child
was dead and that the
Court was up against a
stone wall. But Chief
Justice Stout ruled that
this was a case for com-
mon sense rather than
mere law. He stated
that he had no doubt in
his own vast intellect
that Minnie Dean mur-
dered the child a year or
two before the codicil was
made, and that in conse-
quence the gift to the child really never
took place. So he ordered the Public Trus-
tee to hand the spare cash to the legatees,
who live in the land where business is busi-
ness.
Sydney Telegraph said last week that the
outlook of war in Europe had completely
diverted interest from the Australian elec-
tion. But it didn’t divert attention from
the horse. Last week the person
whose name appears underneath saw a surg-
ing crowd round some notice outside a pub.
Thinking it might, be news of a decisive
battle that fat man (his name appears
underneath) ran as hard as his boiler could
drive him to read. After fighting and but-
ting his way through the mob he discovered
it was the result of a pony race meeting.
Ten yards away there was an announcement
about the war, and not a soul was looking
at it.
[C. A. Jeffries, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
A Kalgoorlie woman lias just taken a
fall out of Westralia’s obsolete impristm-
ment-for-debt law. Only the bailiff can
arrest the man or woman who is ordered by
the Court to pay tip, or turn up and explain
why it isn’t done. The goldfields lady
settled matters by simply going to bed. For
the poor bailiff and his two assistants she
wouldn’t budge an inch, and she preserved
the same magnificent inactivity when a
policeman was called in. He was power-
less unless she smote with her feet or hands
or tore his uniform. She did none of these
things, but snuggled down quite comfortably.
So the law is at a standstill.
Europe carries about five royalties to the
acre, and, up to the last black hours that
fled before Armageddon, they had spent most
of their tame lives trotting about pleasure
resorts and getting snapshotted far from
their frowning, ancestral palaces, and hic-
cupping ancestral wine-cellars. When
European war broke out in real earnest for
the first time in many years all these assorted
kings spilt their assorted drinks, upset the
cafe tables, and, shouting to their suites to
leave the luggage and follow at top speed,
stampeded towards the nearest railway sta-
tion, wharf or garage. There hasn’t been
such a rush of kings for quite a while. Dur-
ing the past week or so only the most
remote European escaped being bowled over
and trampled on by a frenzied royal person,
who was issuing mobilisation orders as he
ran, and declaring martial law with his
feet.
In Melbourne, where the thermometer has
lately been doing its best to sit on the lap
of zero, a plea has been raised for the post-
man, in his sweltering uniform of red and
blue. Mrs. A. Baillieu, as president of the
St. Kilda branch of the People’s Liberal
party, led the wail. She wrote to the
Department that, during last summer, her
heart palpitated for the panting., perspiring
postman, who went his round with his coat
in one hand, his bag of letters in the other
and his cork helmet crushed under his arm.
The Postal folk were guilty of gross cruelty
in not providing its letter deliverers with
lighter uniforms, she said, and suggested
that, in the coming summer, the postman
should be dressed in khaki, like the boy
scout. This military uniform did not ap-
peal to the Postal heads; nevertheless Mrs.
Baillieu’s pathetic picture moved them into
announcing that official sanction had been
given to have summer tunics made without
lining and the stiff collar-band. Another
victory for the Liberal party !

“Melb.” hires a taxi for half-an-hour:—
Parer’s venerable Duke Restaurant, in Bourke-
street, is closed, and will be replaced by the Star
Picture Theatre, which has lately occupied the Wax-
works. Parer’s restaurant replaced the Canterbury
Music Hall, established in opposition to the Surrey
Music Hall, Melbourne’ first theatre, known at differ-
ent times also as the Victoria and the Royal, near
the Bull and Mouth. There is a tradition also of an
Adelphi Theatre in Flinders-lane. The Waxworks
were established elsewhere by Mrs. Williams, in emula-
tion of Madame Tussaud. She married Sohier, a
phrenologist, who advertised always: “Know Thyself.”
The present site of the Waxworks, before occupancy
by Kreitmayer, was the Casino de Venise, leased at
one time by Joe Thompson, the bookmaker. The
Waxworks have been kept up at the rear of the
Star Theatre. The three Parer brothers, Steve, Phil
and Johnny, established the Duke about 55 years
ago. Another Spaniard was Arenas, who kept the
Spanish Restaurant, near Cole’s Book Arcade. A
third was Rubira, who mounted from the John Bull
Tavern, in Little Collir.s-street, to Ilosie’s, in Bourke-
street, where he remains. Mrs. Rubira was Miss
Guidotti, of the Opera, and she was Spanish, too.
Then there was the charitable Be Freitas, the Por-
tugee, with Iris Mechanics’ Restaurant, where the
famous “eight o'clock rush” used to occur when the
boom broke. When Greek meets Spaniard then comes
the tug-of-war. The Greeks lord it in Melbourne
restaurants, and the Spaniards have been driven
back. The Parers gave up the Duke for Nissen's
Crystal Cafe, and they have sold that, too, the pur-
chasers being the Centreway Co., front Collins-street.

“ Jeames” :—-
The cabled intimation that Mr. Freeman-Mitford
wants to have the editor of the London Sporting
Times criminally prosecuted was the first hint the
general public had that the recent marriage of Lord
Redesdale's eon and Mr. Friedlander-Fuld’s daughter
had been a failure. Young Freeman-Mitford was in
the diplomatic service. He secured last January in
the Friedlander-Fuld maiden the matrimonial catch
of Germany, if not of the world. Her father
announced his intention of taking him into the busi-
ness, as was done in the case of the j’oung doctor
who married the heiress to the Krupp billions. And
now they are separated, and He Wend Fenton, of the
Spouting Times, has levelled at the luckless Freeman-
Mitford the charge which thousands of Englishmen
and thousands of Germans, of a certain type, have to
sustain, either privately or publicly, nowadays. The
victims of these dreadful accusations are mostly
either prominent politicians or effeminate-looking
youths, about whom nothing much is known except
that the3 r wear side-whiskers, and tint their waists
are too pronounced and their hair too long. The
framers of the indictments are usually strenuous
characters who have been accused themselves
of pretty well every offence barring this, in
their time. De Wend Fenton, for example,
was regarded as “pie hot” —to borrow the
phrase of agonised backers —when on the turf. Some
of his efforts in the riding line were masterly in
their impudence. When he was selected to edit the
Spouting Times, in succession to John Corlett,
“Pitcher,” Colonel Newnham Davis, and others of the
staff were so scandalised that they incontinently aban-
doned their billets. He is a picturesque writer, and
has turned out a capable editor (what he doesn’t
know about London and the world of sport
being a negligible quantity) ; but he has landed
England’s leading purveyor of journalistic obscenities
in more trouble in the course of a couple of years
than his predecessor did during quarter of a century.
On the other hand, he has never been even so much
as dimly suspected of wearing side-levers. Freeman-
Mitford, assuming his case is good, will probably have
at Fenton on a criminal libel charge, though it is
notoriously hard to get a British jury to convict on
this issue, and infernally unpleasant for the plaintiff
if it acquits
THE WAR SCARE.
All the kings are hurrying to their respective

KING BILLY: “Mine cripes , mine think it I’ d
better hurry back to La Perouse and
mobolise.”
“Billy Blue” : One of the oldest pubs in
the suburbs of Sydney is the Bald Faced
Stag, in crowded Leichhardt. It was first
opened in that name in 1849, by the late
Charles Hearn, who was born at Camden
(N.S.W.), in 1816. His father, Abraham,
a Gloucester man, had a farm at Camden ;
but it wasn’t a success, so he opened the
Spread Eagle Hotel on Brickfield Hill,
Sydney. After a few years he went to
South Creek, and then purchased some land
from Captain Piper, at the corner of the
Balmain and Parramatta roads, and in 1831
built there the Australian Hotel. In 1849
his son Charles took it over, and changed its
name to the Bald Faced Stag, and the Bald
Faced Stag it has been ever since. The
original humpy was long and low, with a
verandah all round. In front was a horse-
trough, cut out of a huge ironbark tree,
while over it was hung on another stout
ironbark post a swinging sign with a bald-
faced stag painted on either side. Charlie
Hearn and his pub were famous for the
fruit grown at the back in a spacious
orchard, and visitors from Sydney during
the fruit season were numerous. Charlie,
the orchard and the original pub are now
all gone, and a brick building, flush to the
footpath, supplies the wants of the thirsty
present-day foot-travellers. In the old
days you took a nice drive out into the
country to reach the animal with no hair
on its countenance.
THE DESPERADOES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Prompt action on the part of Mr. Clarence Blaki-
son, who has come to Australia to join Miss Nellie
Stewart in the Mine, du Barry company, saved the
life of Quartermaster Crouch, of the Orontes, in
Melbourne on Tuesday. Crouch slipped off the gang-
way while walking' aboard, and Mr. Blakison and
Albert Nayler, A. 8., one of the crew, saw Crouch’s
predicament, and running down the gangway they
slid down the piles and leaning over the side of the
tender they caught hold of Crouch and rescued him.
- Thrilling item from Sydney Sun.
When careless Quartermaster Crouch fell headlong in
the sea
The multitude on ship and pier were shocked to a
degree.
The Waters round the Melbourne wharves are brown
and cold and deep;
The very place where one might start on his eternal
sleep.
But Mr. Clarence Blakison and Nayler—-the A.B. —
Were fortunately standing near. They could not
choose but see
That Crouch had fallen overboard, and sharply as a
knife
They pledged themselves, at any cost, to save the
latter’s life.
Now see where Clarence Blakison creeps to the
water’s brim,
And mark how Nayler, the A. 8., unfearing follows
him.
They lie upon the tender’s deck as though it were a
couch,
And, while the welkin splits with cheers, extend their
hands to Crouch.
The perils of the enterprise are disregarded quite,
In view of Quartermaster Crouch and his distressing
plight;
With good old British pluck they haul until, ’mid
yell and shout
And rapturous acclaim, they drag the Quartermaster
out.
“Death or the Abbey!” Nelson cried the day he
sealed his fame ;
Nayler, A. 8., and Blakison no doubt said much the
same
What time they grabbed their dripping friend, and
felt the tender list:
Almost one hears their deathless words: “Crouch or
an injured. wrist!”

Yankee parson Charles Sheldon, author of
“In Ilis Steps.” and originator of the anti-
saloon crusade in the United States, has
arrived in Australia on a tour of redemption.
The Redeemer had John the Baptist- as
forerunner. Sheldon, more up to date, is
heralded by J. and N. Tait.
A line from Melbourne; —
Harold Hansell, who published “Dewdrop Dauby”
and other books of frisky humor what time he was
clerking for the Bank of Victoria in Melbourne, is
understood to be sighing for a billet in the Common-
wealth Bank. So white and bright a young Aus-
tralian should not long sigh in vain. Hansell left
the Bank of Victoria because its anti-Labor prin-
ciples of management hurt him sorely. Having tried
other things he reckoned that banking is in his bones,
and the Government institution evidently ought to
be their resting place.
Last Thursday the Federal election scored
its first victim. Thomas Reeves, of Cudge-
gong (N.S.W.), a man aged 71, remembered
suddenly that he had put himself on the roll
in two places, being also recorded as a voter
at Appin (N.S.W.). There is hardly a
smaller place on earth than Appin—save
Cudgegong. And it is 25,000,000,000 to
one that nobody would have noticed or cared
for Thomas Reeves, or mobilised the Federal
army on his account. But the sensitive
patriarch couldn’t stand the “disgrace,” and
shot himself.

The murdered Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
whose ghost is the cause of so much shindy
in Europe, when visiting Australia about
20 years ago, stayed for some days at Narra-
mine, Frank Mack’s station, in the Dubbo
(N.S.W.) district, where he was initiated
into the pleasures of kangaroo hunting, 'lie
was an extremely quiet personage, and
apparently had no desire to kill anybody
under the sun. - v
There may be one or two, but there cer-
tainly can’t be many, older native-born of"
Victoria than Edward Randall Scott Staf-
ford, who is still a brisk figure at St. Kilda.
His troubles began in Elizabeth-street, near
Collins-street, on February 2S, 1838. His
father had charge of the Customs at the time.
The son was long in the Forestry Depart-
ment, and was a well-known “sport” in his
day. Incidentally he is something of a
botanist, and Avas the first to grow prairie
grass in Australia. His birth certificate was
handed out by Bishop Broughton.
Norman Lockhart, solicitor, of the N.S.W.
Crown Law Department, lnls fled for Eng-
land to assist the Bar retained by the Hol-
man Government to resist the appeal to the
Privy Council in connection with the firing
of the Governor-General, his swag and camp
followers from old Government House, Syd-
ney. He has an awkward job. Profession-
ally. he has to do his best to keep the Domain
Bastille for the people; socially, the local
Due d’Orleans and the duchess will never
forgive him if he doesn’t succeed in losing
the case and winning back the ballroom.
“Gordon G.”: Recently haled before The
Great Magistrate, Michael Morris, one of
Vic.’s best known J’s.P. He held the record
for being the only honorary Justice in Aus-
tralia who had sentenced a prosecuting ser-
geant or inspector of police for contempt.
The circumstance arose during the hearing
of a small case at Minyip (Vic.). The offi-
cer who appeared to prosecute at a critical
stage audibly opined that the Bench (Morris,
chairman) hadn’t the intellect of a roasted
peanut, or thereabouts. Morris, who was
nothing if not prompt, immediately pro-
nounced a sentence of five hours, and ad-
journed the Court. Of course, the offender
hurriedly apologised, and the apology was
courteously and generously accepted. The
business of the Court proceeded. The party
with the apology was O’Callaghan, sometime
Chief Commish of Victorian police.
There is only one survivor left, in Aus-
tralia, of McDouall Stuart’s transconti-
nental journey in 1862. The jubilee of it was
kept with some elaboration, but three of the
veterans have dropped since then, and the
52nd anniversary was noted simply by a
friendly call, by some of the S.A. Geogra-
phical Society, on Stephen King at his home
in an Adelaide suburb. There is one more
member of the little party living, J. W.
Billiatt, but he lias long been in England.
The names of the whole party have been
engraved on the pedestal of Stuart’s statue
in Victoria Square, Adelaide.
William Russell Wilson Bligli, a
descendant of Captain William Bligh, famed
as the cause of two mutinies —those of the
Bounty and Botany Bay—died at Black-
lieatli (N.S.W.) in May last, aged over SO,
and left an estate valued at £25,977. He
was a crusty bachelor, and gave his house-
hold effects and the use of his town and
country residences to his niece so long as
she remained unmarried. The residue of
the estate he left to trustees to convert into
money, for the benefit of his nieces, but on
much the same terms as to marriage. Pre-
sumably the old misogynist (or did he
merely hate husbands?) “took the law of
it”; but, if it’s right, the sooner it is made
wrong to penalise any woman for marrying,
the better.
Lionel Robinson, the wealthy London
stockbroker, who has just bought a fine pro-
perty near London for £60,000, is a son of
the late A. B. Robinson, for many years
commercial editor of the Age, and a brother
of Arthur Robinson, M.L.C. He showed
unusually early a keen faculty for making
money. A Melbourne judge relates that
when Lionel was only 13, and living in the
Royal Park with his (the judge’s) family,
he hurried in one morning before breakfast
to see the judge (then a barrister), and
harangued him about some shares. The
barrister listened to the youth’s clever argu-
ments, and said, “If you talk like that at
court one day you’ll make plenty of money.”
Lionel replied that he was going to make
money, but not in court.
“Rapid Fire”: I have heard some silly
rumor that Sir Edward Grey, the attempted
peacemaker of the world, is, in English pub-
lic life, Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs. I have also heard it asserted that,
in private life, he is a cultured widower with
a taste for fishing. I reject both of these
stories as absurd. I am certain in my own
mind that Grey is a well-meaning curate
whose lodgings are adjacent to a particularly
rowdy tenement house called Europe Build-
ings. When the first screams of the present
disastrous feud broke out, the Rev. Mr. Grey
put on his black hat and fled round the
corner to flutter two white dove-like hands in
the enraged faces of the contending parties,
while he begged them in anguished tones not
to do so, and to make friends, like dear, good
people. Several times in the past he pulled
off the amazing trick and saved the general
conflagration, the intending combatants
being too amazed at his fluttering intrusion
to concentrate on the business on hand. But
the whole tindery place is ablaze at last, and
the well-meaning peacemaker in the black
coat can only moan protestingly at a dis-
tance, while the heat scorches his eyebrows
and melts the nozzles of the fire-brigade.

Auckland, M.L., two weeks ago, delivered two public
addresses,, held various secret conclaves with the
faithful in these parts, and then scooted off to Syd-
ney. His two addresses (subjects, “Life After Death”
and “The Doctrine of Re« Birth”) consisted of dull
and dreary twaddle as old as Pythagoras or the
Egyptians from whom lie derived his ideas. C.W.L.
pretends -that he has personally visited “the astral
plane” and acquired knowledge at first hand; but.
if so, he has nothing to show for it. He also
claims to have stood with Mrs. Besant in the
presence of the Supreme Director of Evolution on
the globe; and on the strength of this he intimated
some time ago that it was quite impossible for “dear
Annie” to tell a lie, and therefore everything she
said must be accepted unquestioningly by all good
Theosophists. A peculiar attribute of this head-
beater is ‘that be must not on any account defend
his character against attack. Hence, when a year
ago he was flagrantly libelled in Adyar (Madras),
where he lives, he simply lay down under it with
saintly resignation. Some of his less divine asso-
ciates, however, took action —brought, in fact, three
libel actions,' and lost the lot! Another privilege
of this Great Occultist is that he must not be ques-
tioned —he knows how much to tell you, and there’s
an end on’t! His first lecture in Auckland was an
elementary talk about “spooks,” showing that High
Theosophy apparently ends where spiritualism begins.
When bead beater was last in Christchurch his chair-
man innocently announced at the close of the lecture
that the Great Occultist would now reply to ques-
tions, whereupon the Supreme Mugwump fled preci-
pitately from the platform, hid himself in a dark
room, rent his raiment and shouted “Blasphemy!”
(or something of the sort). At any rate, lie could
not be persuaded to face the audience again. At
Auckland he was too well guarded for anything of
that kind to take place. His place of abode was
unknown, and no person was allowed to have access
to him.
ELECTION LOGIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. ,1. Bennett, the Fusion candidate for Gipps-
land, who is opposing J. 11. Wise, said he was in
favor of the initiative and referendum, and also Pro-
tection, but he would vote against these measures if
his vote for them would defeat his party.—Aue.
“The Referendum is a thing
• 1 always have respected.
Into the fight for it I’ll fling
Myself, if I’m elected.
And should it come to pass some day
That there is danger that it may
Win through—l’ll vote the other way I
“Moreover, for Protection high
These many years I’ve spouted.
But if 1 see il coming 1
Will promptly have it outed!
For other measures, too, I’ve yearned ;
And should it chance that I’m returned,
I'll do my best to have them spurned!”
An independent Liberal bloke—
Not Caucus-bound, like Labor —
It was who in this manner spoke.
A cit. addressed his neighbor:
“This Bennett is the best I know ;
1 like his politics, and so
To G. 11. Wise my vote will go!”
[Written by B. J. 11. Owen, who may be found
at 108 Albert-street, Fast Melbourne, or at the pub
round the corner, in Victoria Parade.]
The Bulletin has one far-sighted con-
tributor, anyhow. That is the verse-smith
who, years ago, pegged out the pen-name of
R. McGeddon.
Tommy Bath, Minister for Lands in
Seaddan’s Wcstralian Ministry, has deter-
mined to take a spell from that political job.
He is-off to Ban Francisco Exhibition as
Commissioner for the Groper State. He
will do as well there as the next man; and,
anyway, he deserves a kind word for his
good-hearted management of affairs at the
Lands Office.
Politicians differ from actors in being their
own press-agents. Benjamin Benny, a highly
respectable lawyer of Adelaide, being a Lib-
eral candidate for the Senate, has announced
carefully that he is not to be confused with
either Penny or Denny, who both are local
members of the same profession. Bertram
Penny jumps joyously into the discussion
with an explanation of how different he is
from Benny. The only contribution by
“Bill” Denny-—who is by far the best known
of the three, having been Attorney-General
in Verran’s Government—is a Bernard Shaw-
like remark that “the only chance Mr.
Benny ever had was in being confused with
someone else.” But the chance for confu-
sion of names is not a patch on the position
of a generation back, when Hay, Bray and
Way were three of the foremost names in
Adelaide, closely pursued by Jay and Kay,
Gay and Gray, May and Ray, and quite a
quantity of Day.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Fven before Germany and Russia had been
drawn into the war, all tlie ’principal Stock
Exchanges of Europe had been closed against
business. This is the first time the London
Exchange’s doors have been shut. Almost
simultaneously, in order to check the out-
flow of gold, the Bank discount rate was put
up to 10 p.c.—a/rise of 7 p.c. in three days.
For over 40 years it had never ex-
ceeded 7 p.c. This extraordinary advance,
coupled with the subsequent suspension of
specie payment-—in other words, the making
of Bank of England notes legal tender —had
a shivery effect in Australia. The signifi-
cance of the steps was pretty generally mis-
read. European countries . were naturally
straining themselves to got gold, and a
potential enemy’s gold for choice, and it
was necessary to do something drastic in
order to make the coin available for possible
national needs. Britain’s own paper is good
enough within the country ; but it is no good
outside. On the other hand, gold talks every-
where ; and there is no telling where the talk-
ing may have to be done. Fortunately
Monday was a Bank and Exchange holiday
in Australia, otherwise the London news
might have had a more distuibing effect than
it had on Tuesday, when the difference
between our position and Britain’s was a
little better understood. As a matter of
fact, there had been far too much panicky
selling of first-class securities in the previous
week. Several bank stocks suffered very
severely; yet, in view of their considerable
holdings in London, where call money is now
worth probably 7 p.c., the chances are they
are making bigger profits than they did
before the world became a seething pot of
devil’s-brotli.
As for the financial institutions them-
selves. Australia owes a great deal to those
managements which have for some time past
been gradually strengthening their cash posi-
tion. until it can be said with the utmost
confidence that, taken as a whole, Australian
banks were never in so good a position to
meet a crisis as they are to-day. The com-
plete Australasian figures for the June
quarter are not available yet; but for the
March quarter the l Australian banks’ coin
and bullion and Commonwealth notes (which
are backed by coin and bullion) were equal
to 56.80 p.c. of all the banks’ liabilities at
call; and invariably, as the wool and other
payments are made, there is an increase,
usually of from 2 p.c. to 6 p.c., within the
next quarter. It is quite safe, then, to say
ll at the banks in Australia could at this
moment pay in coin and legal-tender notes
69 p.c. of all that they owe on current
account and such-like; and in coin alone,
exclusive of notes, they could pay 51 p.c. of
all their liabilities at call. When the deposi-
tor wakes up at 2 a.m. and remembers his
own few pounds of credit balance, and re-
flects that there is £36,000,000 or more in
coin and bullion in the banks’ tills and
safes to pay him with, be may turn over
and go to sleep like a sensible man. In the
third quarter of 1892, when (lie banks owed
an enormous amount of money on so called
“fixed” deposit to English and Scotch in-
vestors, all they had was £20,586,000 in coin
and bullion. Compare those two figures—
-20 millions then and 36 millions now—and
you get some idea of tlie remarkable change
for tlie better which lias come over tlie Aus-
tralian banking position.

This co. has a few hundred audits to pre-
pare for besides its own ; and as it found
that it couldn’t abolish tlie Christmas gorge
it decided to abandon December to the gorge
and put its own extra work into June.
Hence the figures in the last line are for 18
months. Averaging tilings, tin 1 profit for 12
months would be £14,284, which shows a
slight shrinkage. However, as 64 months’
profits were sufficient to pay the 18 months’
dividend at the rate of 10 p.c.. shareholders
haven't much cause to complain. It is in-
deed au extraordinarily profitable business.
Here is a co. which need scarcely risk its
principal, and is still able to show a shade
over 10 p.c. p.a. of profit on its total funds.
Yet while making this profit it and others
like it are unquestionably doing good work
for the public. Before the permanent trustee
was invented, a man making a will never
knew who would administer his estate when
he was too dead to do it himself. lie pro-
bably chose a friend, but the friend was no
more immortal than he. In fact, especially
if he were a man not old, he inclined to put
his trust in one older than himself. If his
executor died, that executor’s executor was
(and still is) entitled to take up the job;
and this latter executor might he a man
whom the original testator wouldn’t trust
with tuppence. Even if the man named as
executor lived he might shift his quarters
or change his habits. The trustee co., on
the other hand, doesn’t depend on the life
of one man or a hundred men. Thus con-
tinuity is provided for. More than that, the
beneficiary is guaranteed against the misuse
of trust funds, first by the fact that the cp.
is in this business as a business and can’t
shift to some place where it isn’t known if it
does wrong; then by the other fact that it
puts up capital and is worth powder and shot.
Of course this and other trustee cos. don’t
work for nothing. But the ordinary charges
are small: supposing an estate worth £20,004)
is in hand for 10 years, and produces 5 p.c.
pai.. the charge is £5OO, plus £25 p.a.=£2so
for 10 years; total £750, or £75 p.a.=7s. Gd.
p.c. p.a. of the capital value. If (as gener-
ally happens) the- estate is longer in hand,
the charge works out at less ; ss. p.c., for
example, for 20 years.
As indicated above, the co. charges one
commission otr the capital value, and an
annual commission on the income. The
practice is to reserve some of the corpus com-
mission, only taking credit for it as the
trust is gradually worked out. For the past
IS months the position is as follows: —
Profit as stated by the co. . . . . . . £15,441
Added to Commissions Reserved Account . . 5,986
Total profit . . . . . . £21,427
The previous, statement that the profit was
£21,427 needs qualifying therefore to this
extent. And there can hardly be a question
as to future profits being large. This shows
the growth of estates in hand :-—-
1895 .. .’. .. £2,424,413
1900 3,928,520
1905 . . .. .. 5,753,223
1910 . . .. .. 8,175,990
1911 8,853,882
1912 9,791,590
1911 11,440,448
Without doubt there are also hundreds of
wills iu existence, made by men still living,
in which the co. is named as executor. On
the other hand, a shrinkage in values (capi-
tal and annual) will cut into the co.’s earn-
ings. which are on a fixed percentage basis;
and such a shrinkage is highly probable.
Further, the State has just gone into the
business; and in Britain a similar State
office lias had extraordinary success: the
amount of business negotiated since Jan.,
3908, when its door was first opened, is over
£91,000,000. And because a Public Trust
Office is only out to make enough profit to
form a reserve sufficient to safeguard tlie
general body of clients, it seems highly pro-
bable that concessions will be made from
time to time which are bound to affect the
business and profits of trustee cos.

But a shipping co. distressed by excessive
profits can easily find ways of stuffing a
trifle out of sight. The simplest plan is to
pay for ships, etc., out of profit and say
nothing about it. The co. did this for some
years ; but now the time has come when it
doesn’t want any more ships, so it has to
produce the same result by writing down its
property, and that “smother” is more ob-
vious. Six months ago steamers were said
to be werlb £157,125. Now. though this
paper hasn’t heard'of the sale or loss of any
Manly ferries, the item is down to £150,757.
The difference —£6388 —plus anything spent
on improvements, has apparently been
written off, ostensibly to cover depreciation.
Another view of the case can be got this
way:—
Dec., ’l3. June, ’ll.
Assets other than steamers, free-
holds and plant .. .. £50,586 £56,465
Liabilities . . . . . . 2,247 909
Surplus liquid assets .. .. £48,339 £55,556
Thus, after paying the 131 p.c. on the much-
watered capital, and making additions to
plant, and paying for renewals, etc., the co.
is £721 1 better off than it was six months
ago, less whatever value ships, etc., have lost
as the result of the half-year’s wear. And
th: past six months’ figures are not extraor-
dinary. The co. to-day owns up to £247,619
of net assets; and the steamers are probably
undervalued. Of that lot, £25.000 repre-
sents capital actually paid up 10 years ago
and £4335 paid up since; leaving £218.284
as profits made and left in the business in
excess of the very handsome dividends paid.
On capital actually paid the present div. is
at the rate of about 96 p.c. p.a.
Six months ago Ihe co. had under £46,000
cash in hand, and now it has over £53,000;
and as it is announced that no more ferries
are wanted for a while, the directors are
worried again. How can they get that
money out to the shareholders? They can’t
do it by issuing more bonus shares. That
plan would simply absorb a little more profit
term by term. They could, of course, declare
a cash bonus—but that might cause trouble,
the socialistic tiger being abroad in the land.
Possibly tenders will have to be called for
a scheme bv which the unfortunate share-
holders may suck up the profits without
arousing the public which has supplied them.
As for flies in the rich keg of butter, The
Bulletin can see only two : The Socialistic
insect before mentioned, and the possibility
of heavy claims arising out of a ferry dis-
aster —heavy claims followed by the indis-
position of Mum to take the children by
boat to Manly when they might go by tram
to Coogee.

The bank has no brass-plate outside Bal-
larat, and this policy lias its advantages. In
particular, the manager can see how every-
thing stands without moving from his office
chair; so the bank has a particularly small
expense bill to meet. On the other hand, it
depends entirely on its own town and the
district roundabout. When that slumps, the
bank has no branches in other more prosper-
ous parts to equalise matters. As to the
present strength, shareholders’ funds (before
the last dividend was paid) amounted to
£174.834, and liabilities (deposits, etc.) were
£237,150. In other words, the bank is in
the exceptionally strong position of having
£1 of its own for each £1 7s. Id. of outside
money. And to meet these liabilities it has
£108.413, or just over 45 p.c., held liquid.
Calculated on capital and reserves, the profit
lias moved thus :—•
Dec., 1910.. £5 2 8 p.c. Dec., 1912.. £5 7 3 p.c.
June, 1911.. 5 4 6., June, 1913.. 5 5 9 ~
Dec., 1911.. 5 5 9 „ Dec., 1913.. 5 5 9 „
June, 1912.. 5 4 10 ~ June, 1914.. 5 6 0,,
A bank that took more risks would show
better figures, but, on figures, it is doubtful
if any institution in Australia could show
better security. Moreover, reserves are so
large in proportion to capital (£85,000) that
if banking business in Ballarat fell flat, the
co., by investing in 4 p.c. stocks, could go on
paying its shareholders the 8 p.c. dividend,
and still be able to accumulate reserves.

This co. was formed in 1888, with a paid
capital of about £20,000. Subsequently, as
the good habit of selling wool in Australia
grew, the co. had need of more money to
finance clients, and further cash was got in.
Also, other businesses were absorbed. In
1908 50,000 new shares were issued at a pre-
mium of 2s. (Id. ; and, as the business still
grew, in 1912 a further 62,500 were sent to
market at par, making the present capital
£125,000 in £1 shares paid to 10s. But
though the capital has thus grown pretty
fast, and though dividends have very pru-
dently been kept moderate and the surplus
profits accumulated, the co. has had to depend
more and more upon outside money to finance
the business. This next table goes into
details: —

Liabilities are lumped on one side and
sundry debtors on the other; and “sundry
debtors” may be very different cattle in a
business of this kind. For instance, they may
be quite safe advances against consignments
or they may be risky loans on pastoral pro-
perty—money lent to help people buy
stations, etc., at the very high prices ruling
of late. Anyway, with £327,974 owing to
the co., and a good deal of it possibly owing
on the securities just mentioned, tlie stock
must be regarded as an investment carrying
considerable risk. Certainly the reserves are
fairly substantial: but when they do come
the losses in the pastoral industry come in
such big lumps Hat a reserve which would
he ample in most businesses is promptly
licked up in this. In estimating the size of
the risk it would be a great advantage if the
co. would show the advances made on flocks
and herds and pastoral property separate
from those against market consignments.

This society has been running for 45 years

There you have over a quarter of a million
of money lent out, and. as far as this paper
can see. there isn’t a penny of fixed capital.
What is described as capital may be with-
drawn ; and the borrowed money, secured by
debentures, is lent to the society at rates
running from 4| p.c. for 32 months to 3J
p.c. for deposits at call. To meet its deposits
at call it had £1874 in the bank on April 21.
Admitting that the money which the society
lends is to be repaid by monthly or fortnightly
instalments, and admitting that a kind of
reserve is thereby constituted, it is conceiv-
able that, in a scare, there would be a rush
for money; and as this would happen just
when people were least inclined to buy, the
slump would be so great that heavy losses
would be inevitable. Yet the society is pro-
hibited by its rules from holding a reserve in
excess of 1 p.c. of its advances. In spite of
its 45 years’ freedom from accident, and in
spite of the society’s excellent intentions,
The Bulletin has no hesitation in saying
that the country which permits the opera-
tion of a concern on this basis has no proper
regard for the financial well-being and secu-
rity of its citizens. In a less-favored district
and with a less cautious management it
must have come to grief long ago.

For the six months to June. 1900, the profits
were £7OO. and the dividend 3jt p.c. Now,
on watered capital, the dividend is 20 p.c.,
and profits £OOBB. What they will be in
another eight years no one can say ; but as the
boom in borrowing and construction will not
last for ever —one bad season will shake it—
this paper will be very surprised if they
remain at £OOOO. When the slump does
happen this co. is going to be hit in two
places: 41) the expenditure of borrowed
money will stop, and (2) the increasing
scarcity of gravel on the front path will be
overlooked. The directors attribute the fall-
ing off for the six months to bad weather and
shortage of trucks. Perhaps the State and
various other new quarries had a little to do
with it. too. Incidentally, a quarry is a
wasting asset, and in ordinary circumstances
dividends are more or less a return of
capital. But, apart from the fact that this
co.’s supplies of gravel are replenished by
floods, it is writing off pretty large sums
each half-year, so that when the last load
of metal is trucked away the shareholders
won’t be left with a large supply of atmo-
sphere figuring in the books as a stone
quarry.
The next comparison shows how the boom
has affected the co.’s finances: —
June. 1909. June. 1914.
Liquid assets . . . . £5230 £18.848
Liabilities . . . . 7987 1,738
Excess liabilities. . £2757 -—-
Surplus assets . . £17,110
In five years—the five years during which
the boom has been at its highest—-(he posi-
tion has improved by £19,867. cf which, how-
ever, £6BOO has come in as new capital.
Meanwhile plant, etc., lias bee > add' d to
largely, so that probably more rl-n £19,867
of surplus profit has either be i saved up
liquid or put back into the br?i less. Be-
sides that, large dividends have been paid,
and necessary renewals and repairs made —
a performance wive 1 : suggests that, in good
times, a blue-metal and gravel quarry is a
much better proposition than the average
gold mine.
The North Coast Co-operative Co.
4Byron Bay. N.S.W.) was. on account-of
the dry months at the beginning of the year,
able to turn out only 8,940.4891 b. 4about
3991 tons'* of butter for the six months to
the end of Anril, as compared with
9,22. - ).6201b. 44119 ions 4 for the correspond-
ing portion of 1913. However, the average
erice. including exports to London, was
11.31 d. as against 10.9 d. in 1913. Another
of the co.’s hobbies, pigs, also suffered
through the dry spell, and the number of
hogs assassinated fell from 21,714 (at 5.12 d.
per lb. ) to 19.163 4at 5.48 d. per lb.). On a
turnover of £490.000 the half-year’s profit
was £2398, which suggests that the co. pays
its suppliers the utmost that it can for their
goods. _ Ample allowance is also made for
depreciation for the six months, the profits
being shown after £2500 has been written
off. Reserves (mostly to protect the co. in
case it overpays on shipments) amount to
£21,867. Fortunately it eets prompt cash
for most of its products, otherwise (since it
has £61,351 in plant) its capital (£31.356)
would he wholly inadequate. Even as it is,
the assets other than fixed plant amount to
less than the current liabilities, and that
looks like over-trading.

The Union Bank, whose £25 shares have
lately been at £6O, thinks that it would be
mdre convenient if they were split; and a
scheme having that end in view was being
finalised when the war crisis intervened, and
hung up all such comparative trifles.
The outlook for Australian metal minors is
very gloomy. There is a fair market for
refined lead and silver in China and Japan;
but except for a little sent to the Central and
other English refineries, practically the
wjiole of the lead and zinc concentrates go. to
Belgium and Germany in German bottoms.
Of the copper, Germany and America take
about equal quantities; and there isn’t much
left over for anybody else. Tin ingots go
mostly to Germany and Britain; tin concen-
trates are largely shipped north to the
Straits Settlements, where they are smelted
and gambled in. These latter shipments may
continue, but the others have stopped sud-
denly. It isn't healthy for ships to poke
around the seas with valuable cargoes these
days. A German ship which happened to be
in a Russian port when the war started is
safe; it can be detained, but not confiscated.
The same with a ship which puts into port
during a war, unconscious that there is a
war. The same (with certain modifications)
with a ship which puts to sea before a war
starts. But a ship which puts to sea after
war starts may be captured and confiscated
by the enemy, along with all its cargo. The
mining cos. will not, therefore, be able to get
their stuff away; and it is very doubtful
whether they can get sufficient accommoda-
tion from the banks to enable them to go on
normally and pile up their outputs. Already
two big Broken Hill cos. have shut down,
and others will certainly either follow or
limit their operations.
* * * *
The first sign of the industrial trouble
which is probably going to be Australia’s
worst share of this war-upheaval came to
The Bulletin from far-away Whim Well,
on the Nor’-West Coast of Westralia. Whim
Well is owned by an English co., which is
Understood to ship its product to Germany.
On Monday afternoon a wire from there fell
in: “Mines closed down. All hands dis-
charged. Fortnight’s wages unpaid. Majority
stranded. Ship at anchorage 2000 tons ore
aboard.” This was from the secretary of the
local union. The unfortunate fellow's proba-
bly hadn’t heard even a rumor that Hell had
been let loose in Europe, and therefore didn’t
know what had struck them.
With the money market gone nobody knows
where, Mount Cuthbert (Q.) is more anxious
than ever about that second section of rail-
way line which has yet to be completed
before smelting can be thought of. In the
interval there is the interest on debentures
to worry over. Cuthbert would like to rake
in the Is. per share of uncalled capital if
the market would suffer it. Lots of money
is v'anted to bring even a rich copper show
to the productive stage, and Cuthbert’s Ival-
kadoon, Warwick Castle and Mighty Atom
are infants in the early stage of development.
There may be 4000 tons of ore at the Kalka-
doon above the 150 ft. level, but Cuthbert’s
smelter would soon eat that up. Altogether,
the crash has come at a mighty awkward
time for Mount Cuthbert.
* * * *
Even before the European pot boiled over.
Mount Bischoff (Tas.) wms in trouble, and
was putting men off from the poor places.
Last Friday, when it was decided to shut
up the London metal market, at least two
Australian tinbuyers received instructions
to close their books. Bischoff is in no
financial position to stand up against this.

To make things worse in North Queens-
land, the Cliillagoe Co. finds itself so hard
up that development work at the new Mulli-
gan coalfield has been stopped. The co.
was more or less relying on the Gov-
ernment taking over the railway; but
evidently there’s nothing doing.
Great Fingall’s accounts for last financial
year show a surplus of £2BOB. Add the
amount brought forward and the total is
£15,808. A Is. dividend and £971 written
off the cost of prospecting outside ventures
absorbed £13,609, leaving £1699 to be carried
forward. The general managers estimated
that at December 31 last there were 69,442
tons of 395. 2d. ore in sight below No. 14
level. As regards the future, if the co.
working the mine honestly can for the next;
year or so make a couple of thousand pounds
a month profit it will do very well. The
talk about the property being as good as ever
is rubbish.
* * * *
After loyally whooping about the great
value of the Marvel Loch district (W.A.)
the local paper has now started to tell the
truth. The principal mines, it says, arc
breathing their last, and the smaller shows
are only struggling to exist because there
isn’t enough money to pay burial expenses.
It might have added that Yilgarn is full of
places which have not and are never likely
to come up to original expectations. As a
profit-earner the Edna May, with its short
shoot and three- or four-acre ore deposit, is
probably worth more than all the rest of the
Yilgarn mines put together, and a strong
doubt still exists about the permanency of
(>ven that show at depth.
•X- * * *
Phillips River (W.A.) has got its State
smelter going at last. A staff of engineers,
fitters, etc., has been overhauling and re-
modelling the works since January last,
and the general opinion on the spot is that
the Government could have built a smaller
and more suitable smelter at the port of
Ilopetoun, some 80 miles away, for less
money than has been spent on altering and
improving the present plant. About 5000
tons of ore and old residues representing
60 days run have been scraped together, but
it is doubtful whether sufficient material
will be forthcoming to keep the plant going
when the accumulation has been treated
The trouble is that the shoots of gold and
copper on the field are short and erratic;
and the smash in the metal market doesn’t
help matters.
Things that chairman G. P. Doolette told
shareholders at the Bullfinch meeting: (1)
they must not be frightened out of their
holdings by adverse criticism: (2) he be-
lieved that those who sat tight on their
shares would come out on top ; (8) present
developments justified the statement of
lately-deceased manager Fred Morgan that
the mine was one of great potentialities;
and (4) the creep had deprived the co. of a
lot of payable ore in the northern series
above the No. 2 level. This ore, he said,
would be all won in course of time, and
preparations were being made to work it
from a shaft sunk in solid ground to the
east. The southern series, from which the
co. had to get most of its mill supplies since
the creep occurred, had stood to the mine
well, and was of such large extent that up
to the present it had only been scratched.
Owing, however, to the lower grade of this
ore, larger inroads had to be made on the
remnants of the original rich shoot on which
the show boomed and bloomed ; but a block
of high-grade ore below the 100 ft. level was
now being stoped upwards from the 200 ft.
workings. The mine will probably go on
producing for a long time to come, but in
estimating profits it is just as well to remem-
ber that Doolette is an apparently-incurable
optimist.
* * * *
Ivalgoorlie is elated over the intersection
at 2900 ft. of high-grade telluride ore in the
Golden Horseshoe. Croakers are locally in-
vited to do as Judas did, and pessi-
mists are advised to follow suit. But hold
on ! The No. 4or Boulder-boundary lode in
which the telluride has been found has
always been regarded as the most persistent
of all the Ivalgoorlie gold deposits; and
nothing that may happen in this lode will
alter the fact that as most other shoots hq.ve
gone down they have become smaller and
poorer. All the big mines are affected.
Some of them, notably the Brown Hill and
Associated Northern, are breathing their
last; the -Ivalgurli and Boulder’s days are
numbered; the Ivanhoe is badly damaged ;
and the Associated, Perseverance, South
Ivalgurli, Lake View Consols and even the
Horseshoe are not what they used to be.
What sane mining man would expect it to
be otherwise?
At the end of 1913 Westralia had 698
producing gold mines. East Coolgardie
(Ivalgoorlie) accounted for 67. Murchison
108, North Coolgardie 96. East Murchison
62. Mount Margaret 60. YTlgarn 71. Cool-
gardie 45, Dundas 23, Yalgoo 25. Phillips
River 22. North-East Coolgardie 37. Broad
Arrow 35, Pilbarra 31 and West Pilbarra
and Peak Hill 8 apiece. The gold-treat-
ment machinery working or lying idle in the
State at the close of the same year was
3337 head of stamps, 11 prospecting, 39
flint, 49 ball. 18 Griffin. 22 Huntingdon
and 2 Tremain mills. 81 other crushers,
8 puddlers. 385 grinding pans, 1269 leach-
ing vats, 327 agitating vats and 215 filters.
The total value put on this lot was
£3,498,500. East Coolgardie produced 55.42
p.c. of the year’s output; Murchison came
next with 0.80; then Mount Margaret 7.08,
East Murchison 0.77. Yilgarn 6.84, North
Coolgardie 5.28.
Mount Oxide came into court in Sydney
last week and told, the Equity Judge that it
could very well pay its debts. By this time
official-liquidator Palmer had started on the
job to which he had been set a few days
before; so the Court allowed him 20 guineas
for his trouble and called him off. Which
was probably a mistake. The inside of the
business badly needs investigating, and an
official liquidator would have done it best.
Having got its ore-dressing plant ready,
the Mammoth (N.Q.) has started up its
furnace again.
For 12 months to April 80, Vegetable
Creek (N.S.W.) produced 198 tons of tin
concentrates. Luckily the price was excep-
tionally high, averaging £l2O per ton. so
this long-struggling concern was able to
make a profit of £9470. After allowing for
royalty payments there was £5855 in the till
on April 80. With the profit on about 70 tons
of oxide produced since the accounts were
made up, there should be over £6OO available
to pay the 3d. dividend and provide for a
special settlement with the landlord. To July
13 the total output of oxide lias been 5414
tons, worth £64,019, and no less than £14,245
has been paid off the landlord's purchase
price, originally £25,000. After the special
settlement is made in August there will he
about £8750 still to pay. Reserves are esti-
mated at 381 tons of oxide; but only a small
proportion is immediately available. The
present position isn't good, for wages claim
£7OO per fortnight, which is roughly £6B
per ton of concentrates, and the tin market
is knocked dizzy.
* * * *
Carpathia (N.S.W.) looks like small divi-
dends if tin doesn’t slump any more. For a
week it milled 180 tons ore for 12 tone, of
concentrates (04.1 p.c.). For all that, no
one dare back it to put out 500 tons of oxide
a year. Returns that drop from 17 tons to
six tons a week don’t inspire confidence;
hence the stock has a market value of only
about £50.000. The mine is just as erratic
as the battery return, and in spite of to >
fact that some of the workings are very wide
the despatches were only 100 tons last week.
Carpathia is like the Vulcan (N.Q.) in hav-
ing wide faces and small reserves, the pay
•stuff being in big isolat I patches of pipes.
Managing-directors (J ovett and Hoover
didn’t add much to the Zinc Corporation’s
printed report at the annual meeting in
London. Oovett’s most interesting state-
ment referred to the South Extended, next
door. ■ The Corporation’s zinc lode runs into
the Extended. The latter 00. had one of its
numerous reconstructions last year, and the
underwriters were left with most of the
shares. For £35.000 the Corporation then
bought 73 p.c. of the property. The Ex-
tended won’t pay to work as a separate con-
cern (that’s Govett’s opinion and The
Bulletin’s), but the Corporation is now
negotiating to buy out the minority and work
the claim as part of the other mine. For
the rest, they repeat the.formula that with
speller and lead aggregating £39 per ton, the
co. can show a profit of £150,000 a year after
paying the interest on pref. shares. A rise
of £1 in lead bevond that means a trifle more
than another Cd. per share and a rise of £1
in z ; nc about 6d.
Bears have been having a meal off the
New Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.), but mana-
ger Toole still smiles. If he were an impres-
sionist he would be getting and reporting 2oz.
prospects from bores and drives, instead of
running up rises to drain the wash, or con-
tenting himself with sober-sided shaft-sinking.
His time for a flutter will arrive when lie
starts out. to bore into the Catlicart gutter
from the No. 2 shaft reef drive. A rich
prospect or two here will set the market
bouncing. Meantime, a Government boring
party working north of the Langi Logan
lease is alleged to be showing that the main
gutter is east of that claim. Even so, it
doesn’t say that the bores from Toole’s levels
and crosscuts lied as to the existence of a
big field of wash or as to the dirt giving good
prospects. Another yarn current is that the
No. 4 rise has been lost. The report says it
was left to drain, and this is probably right.
Once upon a time Cassilis, Gippsland, had
as many developments as blackberries on a
bush ; but since Nicholas left, manager Lil-
burne has been battling against dry weather
and a light purse. Cash wasn’t plentiful
enough to even let him test his pet theory
that rich stone pitched south. Now he has
got going at No. 7, and alighted on a shoot
that has ranged up to soz. in value in the
level and up to 9oz. in the rise. Lilburne’s
deduction from this development is that the
shoot which was supnosed to have cut out at
No. 6 level has pitched flat to the south. The
country there is pretty well unworked; so
Cassilis may have enough left in it to put
its values on a profitable basis again.

“AN UNIMPORTANT FAILURE.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oniv' one unimportant failure wasp recorded yestcr-
d&y.——. An early item of the war patlic days.
B'.dtt was an unimportant man,
One of the unimportant host;
• To unimportant work he ran ;
Withal to Mott Mott mattered most.
Caesar, Napoleon, Fred the Great —
; All these were shadows in his sight;
But Blott was solid, and Blott’s fate
Kept Blott awake on many a night.
• There came a day when War’s hot breath
Blew down the markets, and a lot
Of little things went down to death.
Ini luded in the mass was Blott.
“An unimportant failure’’ —thus
The cables vaguely flashed his fall.
Nobody made the slightest fuss;
Blott was no more, and that was all.
Each man unto himself is Blott,
And kings and nations merely names;
The Universe, immense and hot,
Spins on Blott pivots, splashing flames.
“An unimportant failure!’’ Yes,
To others, if you lilce. But not
To him who knew (we know no less!)
He was the One Important Blott!
O Brother Blott, our fate's the same!
’Though each proclaims with puny fuss
lie is the One Man in the Game,
At last the shadows fall on us!

WOMEN’S WEAK NERVES
Many women suffer from liyper-
sensitiveness of tlie nervous system,
induced liy many causes. Excessive
nervousness is the bane of many lives,
and often a severe attack of nervous
breakdown follows on heavy, exacting
social or domestic duties. Where the
nerves are shattered by physical or
mental strain this is the medicine to
be relied on to quickly strengthen them.

Miss A. M. Cardwell, Coree, Booth

mistress in N.S.W. Public Schools, writes:
“When teaching in N.S. IK. State
schools I often resorted to Clements
Tonic. It was such a restorative it
never failed me. No household should
he ivitliovt it.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, August 3, 1914.
My Dear Arini. —
"The Blue Danube” isn’t quite up to
schedule just now. as a waltz tune, while
the Austrian is banging the Slav on its
hanks. Re the war, by the way, how thin
and faint, like the tinkle of a distant sheep
bell, is the voice of the innumerable Aus-
tralian politician when Europe is taking off
its coat for a fight. While the Austrians
were busy shooting down the Serbs in their
own capital, a belated interview with a Mel-
bourne politician crept into the press. “I
have had no official intimation of war,”
said the Minister for External Affairs. Per-
haps somebody was so busy mobilising
5.000,000 men and trying to borrow
£000,000,000 of petty cash that he forgot to
send a cable.
The Governor-General’s garden party at
the Eadith Walker loan establishment, Yar-
jilla, seems a feeble, far off, trivial show,
since the Great Row began over Peter’s tin-
pot kingdom. Owing to the placard that
invited this paper’s social scribe having been
inadvertently buried by some careless urchin,
and not exhumed till the day after the event,
my news of the historic party before the
war is second-hand. An informative friend
remarks that there was an unprecedented
rush on the forage department. When the
sub-royalties were ready for their little snack
the A.D.O. department had to gather up a
few crumbs to help the tea go down the
right way. A mild air of resentment on
the part of that portion of Society which
bad been shut up in a ferry-boat with its
worst hated friends for over 30 minutes, and
a bumped expression about the usually im-
passive motor-car brigade, which wore its
best hat on its ear when it alighted, were
the most noticeable features of the garden
party. The fashion of bunching up tbe skirts
behind was carried to such a frenzied ex-
treme that two-tliirds of the company looked
like Runty when she was ready for tbe
week’s wash.
The only sartorial event of the Yaralla
garden party was Mrs. Holman’s picture hat.
which, according to latest advices from the
front, was rather smaller than the War. but
much nicer looking. It was beautifully
mobilised, and occupied a strong position.
Governor Brunet, of New Caledonia, who
arrived here with his Madame Brunet in
Ihe Pacifique on Friday night, may stay
longer than lie anticipated. Who knows?
He may even fall in love with our gums
and wattles, and stay till he becomes Ihe
Oldest Inhabitant, and may end by being
buried here with a waratah blooming on the
bosom of his long home.
It is rather a coincidence that the Forbes-
Trefusis lady should look in here, just as
we are trying to gather up our sinews for
war. Last time this tall English dame was
in Sydney she reigned at old Government
House as chaperon to brother William—the
youthful Governor Beauchamp, ivho took
newspaper chaff in such good part. As Lady
Mary Lygon she was associated with our
last war cry—the echoes and troopships of
the S’African squabble. I forget whether our
returned visitor was here before the row
began, but she is certainly connected with
the horrid, trembling uncertainty of “News
from the front —’special ’dition !” —and the
shrill yells of newsboys out of season. Ladv
Mary married —just wait a minute till I lift
it down off the bookcase —tbe Hon. IT. W.
Hepburn-Stuart Forbes-Trefusis. If he
were on the other side, I expect he’d be
buckling on his belt in some kind of fighting
gear, for he used to be in the Scots’ Guards,
and he is on the reserve of a battalion of
Light Infantry.
The F. B. Freehills, formerly of this town-
shin, were in the grey old city by the Thames
early in July. They had been on the
European Continent —a most undesirable
address just now—for some time, and must
be mighty glad to be on the right side of the
Channel.
Miss A. Ducker, the Sydney heiress who
set out on a world tour with her own motor,
some friends and a chauffeur, was in London
a few weeks ago.
The American architect Griffin and his wife
were in Sydney a few days ago. Probably
tbe Federal village at Canberra will take a
complete rest now. A report is abroad that
the new loan has gone lame in consequence
of the war. and been scratched for all
engagements. In other words it won’t run.
The perennially youthful Essie Jenyns
(Mrs. .T. R. Wood) was the graceful Nerissa
io the Portia of Ellen Terry at the huge
matinee recently flung at the veteran actress
in Her Majesty’s Theatre. It seems odd
.enough, when you come to think of it. that
the famous Ellen, who might have been rest-
ing in her cot in Kent, should have been
goaded by Fate into straying so far from
her native sod in these thrilling times.
Some loyal liege said that judging from a
hurried glimpse of the Governor-General on
Sunday, he was a very speedy man. Ilis
Ex.’s collar and tie, if not exactly suspended
in mid air, were anywhere round his neck,
and he dashed off by Sunday’s express for
Melbourne. Official tea parties and frills
are now packed up as public nuisances not
wanted by G.-G. Ferguson till the heavy-
weights in the big fight call for a rub down
and a referee.
Mr. Bob Bell, the genial managing direc-
tor of the N.S.W. North Coast Shipping Co.,
writes to a Mosman friend from the kilted
shores of Oban, which is in Argyllshire,
Scotland, not far from Mull, Skye, Colonsay
and other places which are strong towers of
defence to the British Isles because the in-
vader can’t pronounce the names of them,
and is consequently repulsed with great
slaughter. Mr. Bell and his wife hoped to
leave London for Australia on August 28,
but warlike events have happened since the
peaceful postcard was dropped into a Hie’-
land post office that smelled strongly of
usquebaugh.
One of the queer vagaries of the Gentle-
man Help department is the crash of titles
that follows the person who is gazetted in
attendance. For instance, the most unwar-
like lamb is immediately handed the courtesy
handle “Captain” to go on with. Mr. Cur-
wen, on the Governor-General’s bodyguard,
has never been a soldier, but he is a “Cap-
tain” nevertheless. Mr. Wakeman wears the
same honorary gaud, and Mr. d’Apice, the
local hon. aide (a billet that is paid for in
social glory) was a lieutenant in the cadet
forces. No one grudges him the title of
Major-General or Field Admiral if he’d like
to wear either prefix round his best hat, for
he is one of the best. But this democratic
country seems to be getting as full of un-
earned increment in tbe shape of honorary
titles as the United States in the days when
Dickens fell up against so many colonels
and judges that he couldn’t find a single
civilian. (It was in the U.S., by the way.
that an old-soldierl.v-looking man was asked
by the hotel landlord what rank he had
held during the Civil War. And when he
said lie had been a private the landlord fell
on his head and wept, and said there would
be no bill.)
The Arts and Crafts’ Society has just
issued its peaceful ultimatum or manifesto in
the form of a seventh annual report. Miss
Fairfax is president of this flourishing
fraternity, which now counts 74 members
on _ its roll. “Decided progress” says the
ultimatum, “marks the past year’s work.”
The annual exhibition is to be opened on
August G by Lady Helen M. Ferguson at
3 p.m. The R.A. Society’s rooms in
Vickery’s Chambers will house the show.
Mrs. Arthur Allen has loaned the impres-
sive ballroom at Merioola (Edgecliff-road)
to help the languishing funds of the Twi-
light Home. Over 200 tickets, at a guinea
apiece, were sold last week for the concert
on August G in that large dancing room.
The Ferguson lady is going to shed the light
of her diamonds on the affair. Muriel
Starr, Mrs. Alex. Gordon, Miss Spain and
others are going into the concert business
for the Cause. The party begins at 4 p.m..
and will be over in time to permit the meek
and lowly to rush home to their early even-
ing chops.
Mr. Gerry Cooper, son of the Australian
baronet of that name (of the House of
Daniel), is genuinely addicted to music. He
is going to unload a pet hobby, called
“Thursday 5 o’clocks,” in the King's Hall.
The first concert, which is dated August 27,
will purr softly in the Italian manner. In
case there may be any misunderstanding I
hasten to add that this is not a public
charity. Book your seats at Baling’s in the
same old commercial way. Tenor Philip
Wilson is associated with young Cooper in
the venture.
An Australian in London blushes behind
her fan and tells me this: “On Ascot Sun-
day, when there’s a great collection of glad
rags in the Park, there was a wonderful
display of decollete Society grandmothers.
I noticed that the slit had moved from the
skirt to the bodice. The want of bodice,
and general impression of bare shoulders —
seen through the wisps of tulle—-is supplied
with a slight antidole in the shape of trans-
parent sleeves. Still, they are a cover-
ing for the angular or beefy arms of dow-
ager duchesses and such. Many of these
ladies are taking to bright purple silk hose
for afternoon wear. Anyone who libels the
British peeress to-day as a drab, sad-colored
person of dowdy plumage ought to have seen
her at one of these dress parades in June.
I suppose it’s the joyous clothes of the
former Totties of the Gaiety co’s who cap-
tured the junior aristocracy, that are
driving elderly duchesses of the old order to
drown their sorrows in purple stockings.”
Fiddler Raymond Pechotsch has written a
charming little song, “For Thee,” which is
served up with violin obligato. Dufault sang
this graceful lyric the other evening to ap-
plause that drowned the siren shrieks of
adjacent tubs and scows in Darling Harbor.
The Symphony concert, with conductor
Joseph Bradley in his usual stand, was
starred by the success of fiddler Cyril Monk
in a beautiful solo from a Concerto for violin
and orchestra, by a German composer, Max
Bruch. In order to keep the balance of
power, perhaps, some new Russian thunder,
in the form of Kaliiinilcoff’s Symphony in G
Minor, was supplied by the orchestra. When
a drum went off suddenly, like a gun, the
female hat in the front seats was obviously
startled. Saint Saens’ symphonic poem (a
fine mealy mouthful), called “Phaeton.” was
a good orchestral performance. But Saint-
Saens’ notion of galloping horses —as written
for the violins —wouldn’t be much good to
him if lie ran a racing stable. Phaeton’s
aerial steeds don’t pound the clouds any
faster than a butcher’s horse when it is
steadied to turn a corner. However, the
orchestra did its level best to whip them
into a trot.
“The Dream,” a poetic fragment from
Alfred Dill’s new opera, “Giovanni,” was
something of a nightmare owing to Phil
Newbury being apparently too indisposed to
let the words escape his clenched teeth. This
was at the Symphony orchestral concert on
Saturday afternoon. Hill, who was con-
ducting the fiddlers during this performance,
must have writhed with anguish to hear his
new musical baby smothered by the tenor.
Yet Newbury’s voice, a week or two ago,
was clear and resonant as a bell at the llie-
land Society’s greeting to the Ferguson.
Tenors are uncertain cattle at best, I’m
told.
Lancelot Harrison, B.Sc. of Sydney Uni.,
recently won the Coutts Scholarship. This
entitles him to two years at Cambridge and
a year in Berlin on scientific research work.
His wife, who used to be Amy Mack (a
sister of Louise, who once wrote this letter
to you, Arini), therefore hies to Europe with
her clever husband. For the last seven years
or so the plump and popular little Amy
Harrison has been in charge of the Women’s
Page in the S. M. Herald. In the doing
of this work she has made many friends,
who turned up to bid her farewell, and hand
her an address—written by Ethel Turner—
and a purse of sovereigns. This meeting was
held in the Mayoress’s official den the other
morning, with our municipal mother in com-
mand of the proceedings. Mrs. Alfred Hill
and Mrs. Pickburn were to the fore in
arranging the Harrison adieu. The gentle
Cullen lady. Mrs. George Rankin (a brisk
and up-to-date youngster of 70-odd sum-
mers), J. D. Fitzgerald (of the Town-Plan-
ning campaign), the. Laytons, Mrs. Lindsay
Thompson, imss Rose Scott, General Sec-
retary Ellen Desailly, of the Kindergarten
Union, and a score or two more women
bustled round the proceeding's.
Miss Ida Meecham, only daughter of Mr.
Walter Meecham, was married to a Scotcli-
byterian parson named Stewart Robertson
on July 28. The knot was securely tied at
Burwood by the groom’s clerical brother, who.
had journeyed from Bathurst for that pur-
pose. An extra twist in said knot was given
by Parson Reid, of Woollalira. The kirk
organ was manipulated by the Rev. Horace
Croft, of Mosman. I don’t think there were
any more sky pilots on the premises, but
there was no time to look under the seats.
The birde, who is a pretty and charming dam-
sel, is related to about half a British regi-
ment, or something of the sort. The late
Colonel Meecham. of the Cameronians, was
the best-known of a round half-dozen uncles
who were all tall sons of Mars. Bridesmaid
Una Croft fluttered round the bridal plu-
mage at the right moment. A few friends
and relatives were invited to the wedding
feast, which was munched at the Edward
Crofts’ home, Burwood. Ferns, wattle and
daffodils trimmed the speeches.
Paul Dufault’s little tea-party at the Aus-
tralia. the other afternoon, was a festive
affair with a tasty garnish of new millinery.
Olive Godwin’s small black toque was punc-
tuated with the sharp flare of new bows
that are rather like French cockades set in
half a slice of bomb. Mrs. Brunton. who is
pretty Dorothy’s mamma, and might be mis-
taken for a very young auntie, shoved her
dark Titian locks into one of the new squash
hats. Dorothy’s flaxen curls bobbed in the
vicinity of Fiddler Ernest Toy, and Pauline
Bindley’s fluffly little person was over the
way. The Fourth Estate contributed a
musical cricket or critic or so. and Mrs.
Freddie Shipman poured out tea with a soft
smile, for the Dufault concerts have been
attended by a satisfactory chink of cash.
Marjorie Williamson, eldest daughter of
the late .T.C.W., has taken some of her flap-
per friends off to Kosciusko.
The United Charities’ Fund secretary,
Mr. Arthur Upjohn, is already on the trail
of volunteers who will sell roses for the
Cause on October 24. The Cause includes
GO Good Works. Already over 3000 lady
bushrangers have agreed to bush-range tbe
public, and sell them roses on their own
terms. And the public will doubtless put up
its hands and surrender at discretion. The
Boers, during the late war, defined their
own people as “handsuppers” (those who
surrendered early), and “bitterenders” (those
who hung on to the last). But who can be
a bitterender when a pretty girl offers to
sell him a rosebud for 7s. Gel.?
Perhaps the New Citizens’ Association,
which is incidentally connected with a
broom-handle and other useful weapons for
the improvement of towns and cities, will
meet on August (i, in the Town Hall.
Things are happening too rapidly to be sure
of anything this week. But if the associa-
tion does feel calm enough to go on talking
about better roads round Sydney just now —
it’s mostly feminine —it is respectfully re-
minded that better roads mean cash in hand.
Higher taxes to keep the same in order will
also be necessary, I understand. Blue
metal seems to wear out . almost as fast as
cotton stockings, only you can’t darn
macadam unless you do it; under your
breath, Arini. The British Scientists
(they are to travel over said roads) are
probably an absent-minded lot, who won’t
see anything except a new species of gnats,
or microbes, an inch beyond their learned
noses.
The Women’s Horticultural Guild held
another meeting the other evening, and
appeared to be bustling about its business in
eax-nest. It suggests tying a longer tail to
its skirt, and hopes to grow up into a limited
company (d.v. and the nasty young war
permitting) forthwith. Mr. Chiel, a lead-
ing member of the Botanic Gardens’ staff,
was in charge of the gathering, which had
been rounded up by hon. organising sec. Miss
Brace.
Miss Agnes Ilogg, a much-liked school-
marm in the big Paddington State school,
left for Norfolk Island in the Makambo.
She is going for two years to that lovely
isle—now the most peaceful spot in the
troubled Pacific —as second in command. A
few days before saving good-bye to the
youngsters under her care, Miss Ilogg was
laden with little notes of farewell in all
sorts of childish fist, while the women
teachers handed her a presentation bag of
great merit. This strenuous school-marm
belongs to a well-known family of Braid-
wood pioneers. A maternal grandfather,
one Finlay Mcßae, settled on the land
thereabouts in the year 1838. Mrs. Elliot,
Wife of the former Administrator of the
island, was on the wharf to wave the hanky
of adieu to the traveller, who was sur-
rounded by bouquets, colleagues in the
dominie department, and niece Ethel Ilogg.
The last-named bustled along to say good-
l»ve behind a young mountain of Australian
llora. She looked like Birnam Wood mov-
ing against Dunsinane —if my Scotch his-
tory is correct.
The Dufault concert on August 1, in the
same old Town Barn, was as successful as
every previous effort of the artistic Paul.
Handel’s immortal theme, “Where’er you
walk.” was the vocal vom 0 f the evening.
Pauline Bindley kindly allowed the audience
to hear a word distinctly now and again.
This young Victorian singer’s pretty voice,
full of quality and easily trained to twitter
and trill, is just now blurred by a crude
style and careless enunciation. Violinist
Toy suffered various encores. Jacques
Pintel at the piano was musical matter in
the right place.
Mr. Murphy, the present local ruler of
Norfolk Island, returned to his pine-crowned
eyrie in the Makambo.
War permitting, the Freddie Shipmans
leave Sydney on August 15 for Wellington
(M.L.). They join tenor Paul Dufault in
Auckland on the 28th. They’re going to put
in three days at Honolulu, and then board
the Ventura for the city of the Golden Gate.
Violet Paget is going to be presented with
a complimentary benefit in the Little
Theatre on Saturday week. This is a more
handy thing to have by you than a bouquet
or an illuminated address, anyhow.
The London Daily Mirror mentioned the
appearance of Alice Crawford, the Victorian
girl now on the London stage, as she passed
in the crush at Ascot. She was garbed in
“dead white.” and held over her head the
onlv little early Victorian sunshade seen at
the meeting.
The youthful Mirrie Solomon, who was
going off to Vienna to continue her musical
efforts, is, like many millions more, waiting
anxiously to see the Peace Society slay the
war-dogs with its umbrella. If the umbrella
is lost or breaks, or the war-dog bites it in
two pieces, or if tbe dog takes no notice of
the umbrella, then Mirrie will postpone her
adventure.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.
From a Victorian gallery-man:—
Though Victoria’s new? Premier is not likely to he
the same force in local politics as his predecessor
was, his term will probably see fewer ructions. The
great difference between the two men is that A.
Peacock draws a great number of director's and ether
fees, and runs the Government as a sort of side-line,
whereas 'Willie Watt’s superabundant energy forced
him into trying to carry the whole political burden.
Peacock will conciliate where Watt would fight,
and, consequently, the warring factions in the Minis-
terial party won’t have the same opportunities to
get into holts.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 3. 1914.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The G.-G. arrived back from Sydney in
panic haste to-day (Monday), and was imme-
diately fallen upon by a troupe of Federal
Ministers. Having assured each other that;
the war in Europe was “a very terrible busi-
ness,” and having decided that none of them
could do anything much to stop it, they pro-
ceeded to act accordingly. The latest advices
of my tame runner were to the effect that
they " are still doing it as hard as they
possibly can. The only interesting item which
lie (the runner) was able to extract from
Lord Frederick Blackwood related to Mr.
“Monty” Walker, of Yaralla, where the G.-G.
has been staying. The luckless twin has
broken his collar-bone playing polo, a game
into which he had spiritedly entered only a
week previously, with the purchase of three
or four one-hundred-guinea ponies. It is
such horrors as these that make one realise
the deadly seriousness of Life.
The Caulfield Steeplechase meeting on
Saturday drew an immense crowd, and yet
there was not even half a Governor on view.
As 1 have always understood that one of the
chief uses of Governors is to draw crowds
to the races, the Caulfield happening strikes
me as rather a powerful argument against
employing these imported luxuries further.
Rather like hiring a claque for the prepos-
terously successful Lauder. The Browns, of
kittle Lonsdale-street, were there (she in a
red velvet toque of the 3912 build, lie in the
bowler hat which got so terribly dented at
their daughter’s wedding last January), also
their friends the Smiths, who had that little
bother with tin l bailiffs the other day. But
here am I telling you about all the wrong
people. Mrs. Dick Casey again appeared in
that laurel wreath. She still refuses, why
I know not, to explain how she earned it.
A bachelor doctor (1 withhold his name for
fear of making the rest of the profession
jealous) escorted the smartest girl on the
lawn—a niece from furrin’ parts. She wore
a coat, skirt and cape all in one, and how she
got into it, Heaven, in its infinite capacity
for solving the impenetrable, alone knows.
The baffling garment was fashioned out of
dark-blue cloth, and its effect was to turn
the heads of many of the onlookers dizzy
with envy. Anyhow, they said it was that.
Unbelieving friends put it down in several
cases to drink, and hence argument and much
ill-feeling. Dorothy Moss, of the beauteous
complexion, paraded with her fiance, and
sustained a heavy bombardment of congratu-
lations with heroic composure. One O’Hara
girl turned out in a simple tailored suit;
another walked the lawn self-consciously, in
advance of a big black velvet bustle. Mrs.
Bran ton wore, a hat that reached gaily at
the sunshine in blue tulle pleats. Mrs.
Leslie Macdonald wore a green tapestry
chair cover, or again it may have been a
coat. Mrs. Charlie Mitchell was there, but
1 did not see sister Melba about. I could
not even find her in the birdcage, which was
sufficient proof for me that the sporting
Presence was absent. Miss Nyulasy trotted
about with her bachelor brother, a tartan
cape swinging from her shoulders like a mis-
guided kilt.
A new tenor, named Levienne Davos
(which is so much more beautiful than Levi
Davis or Amos Levien) made his first
appearance at the Saturday Pops at the
Auditorium. We literary girls are quite
mad about him. He is so much a tenor that
he just misses being a soprano. He makes
much use of a “head” voice (mark the tech-
nical term, indicating a knowledge of the
musical art), and puts terrible earnestness
into the passionate parts of his songs. He
is large and fat and bald and 23 —in fact,
as I hinted before, he is little short of rav-
ishing. He has been studying since he was 17,
and has sampled all the different “schools”
in his brief time. Having plumped finally
for the Italian method he is prepared, at
any moment, to sing at you in four
languages, provided, of course, you allow him
to take one language at a time.
For some months now The Bulletin’s
“Jeames” has been prophesying the advent
of the Night Club. It would seem that he
knew a bit, as they say on the turf. An
artistic brown circular has just reached me
which sets out the aims and objects of the
“Eighty’” Club. This club intends to provide
a rendezvous for dancing bohemians (dancing
Philistines, mayors, knights, dervishes, etc..
will. I presume, be ruthlessly pilled) where
music, supper and good-fellowship shall be
obtainable, and where the Tango, Ragtime
and the Hesitation waltz may be indulged in
without restraint. (Moans from the wow-
sers!) Club night, Friday from 10 p.m. to
2 a.m. Insignia, a Silver Owl. Location,
Wyckliffe House, on the Esplanade. St.
Kilda. But why limit the membership to
SO when there must be hundreds fairly yam-
mering to join such an institution? Also,
what arguments are to be advanced against
the militant members of the local Purity
Brigade when they start lodging the inevi-
table protests? These are subjects which
will have to be grappled with bright and
early, by the committee, it seems to me.
I hear that the Alan Burgoynes have been
shooting in Scotland. However, as the bird-
slaying season doesn’t open, in those parts,
till the 12th of this month, I presume my
informant is the usual traitorous liar. Ot
course, there is the possibility that they have
been assassinating the grouse out of. season,
but I am disinclined to entertain that
theory. The rumor is no doubt due to the
fact that Mrs. Burgoyne handles a fowling-
piece with the precision with which women
of a humbler class employ a flat-iron. The
original idea was that 18 members of this
grand old viticultural family should stay at
Burgoyne senior’s Ascot house for race-week.
They may have done so. The Ascot news
has come to hand, and there is no mention
of the Burgoyne homestead having been left
untenanted. But the Scotland rumor still
remains a mystery. Perhaps it is merely a
blind to conceal from the Germans the fact
that Alan is going to the war. He is. need-
less to say, a military man of parts, and the
author of several books on the simplest and
easiest method of wiping the Teuton off the
face of the earth.
Mrs. Geoffrey Syme duly gave that At
Home to celebrate her return from Colombo.
She looked blooming, in an apple-green dress
with green apples, or potatoes or pompoms
or dumplings, or something, embroidered all
over the chiffon in velvet. The skirt was
gathered up to show tricky green silk stock-
ings and shoes. My first action, on catching
sight of her, was, as a lover of Peace, to
fall upon my knees and offer up a brief
Hosannah, inasmuch as Brother Oswald
ltobinson Snowball had not been in-
vited. In the present tense state ot
things, he would have burst. Mrs.
David Syme was there looking about
25, for all that she is a great-grand-
mother. She was wrapped in an ermine
scarf and short skirts. Mrs. Herbert was
in buff, and little Mrs. Oswald hid in the
crush under an adorable hat of flowers. Mrs.
Leslie Stuart wore the newest shape in
capes and a hat like a small torpedo. Mrs.
Burston afl eeted a flowered bonnet of the
Dolly Varden period. Kost conducted in the
gallery above the hall, and. Miss Ivrapp and
Walter Kirby sang—all of which was pleas-
ingly conducive to conversation. \ iolets
and boronia were placed loosely about the
reception rooms', after the fashion of old
Japan. Also, there was a fortune-teller in
a summer-house on the lawn, and tea and
food, and a thousand other delights.
The revelries at Banool lead me by a
perfectly natural process of thought to the
atfairs of Greta Garnett, sister of Mrs.
Geo'ffrey Svmo and a daughter of British
Trade ‘Commissioner Garnett, who circled
this continent last year. She writes from
England that she is to be married shortly to
Mr Jack Robinson. All I know about him
is that he is (1) 2?>, and (2> a nephew of
sister Marjorie’s husband. So when Miss
Greta is married her big sister will be also
her aunt. The bride-to-be recently spent
two'of her 20 years of life in Melbourne with
Mrs. Geoffrey Syme, and made a host of
friends.
Doctor Eben Gould’s children’s party to
the convalescents at the Homoeopathic Hos-
pital was a great success. The children there
have a special house all to themselves set in
the garden away from the big institution.
It has two perfectly appointed wards, and
was built with the money of some anony-
mous donor. There are trees and birds for
the youngsters to watch through big win-
dows, and the nurses cultivate carnations
and geraniums on the window ledges. All
of which helps to stimulate the hospital
atmosphere. Nurses, patients and visitors
ended the day in a blaze of colored paper
caps prized from the crackers, which were
everywhere. This signified jollity. In a
British community one of the several ways
of showing that you are jolly is to wear a
garishly-colored head-covering of paper.
Miss Helen Davis was knocked down in
the street by a too-hurried medico the other
day. She is suffering a very slow recovery,
and has had to give work the go-by for the
present.
Harry Lauder filled King’s Theatre on
Thursday nieht with a mixed audience which
interjected in every shade of Scawtch accent.
In the boxes were fashionables, in the stalls
baldheads and Tam-o’-shanters, and in the
gods retired crofters, ghillies and elders, in
addition to blokes, girls, noise and yells. An
Irishman started a sort of opposition show
at one stage ; but he was flung out amid the
approval of all. A fat merchant sat in an
upper box and laughed so much, in a silent
bianc-mange-shaking way. that the house
began to fear for his safety. He, however,
was not flung out. For the rest, it was the
usual old Lauder entertainment.
Dorothy Moss, of the Kerriwah Mosses,
intends to marry Captain Charles Dare. I
don’t know who he is, and feel too languid
to find out at the moment, but our wash-
lady’s A.D.C. —the one that delivers the
garments—assures me that he is exception-
ally beautiful. Dorothy, as you know, is the
sort of girl that bank-managers bow to from
the other side of a wide street.
Another engagement is that of Cyril Lan-
sell (one of the Fortuna magnates of Ben-
digo) and Lily Anthony. She is the one ewe
lamb of the T. I*. Anthonys, of St. Ivilda.
And, finally, Dr. Noonan, with whom the
habit of being Best Man had threatened to
grow into a lifelong hobby, proposes to make
the great adventure with Edith Lloyd, of
South Yarra. In view of past unpleasant-
nesses, let me mention, here and now, that I
take no responsibility for any of the above
intimations. I have garnered them either
from the papers or from acquaintances who
have played me mendaciously false a
thousand times in the past. If my girlish
trust has again been betrayed—you know
where to place the blame.
The Hennessys, appreciative, as ever, of
Brain, Culture and so on, propose to give a
reception on August 15 in honor _of the
Science Congress. The scientists will thus
have an opportunity of exchanging ideas
with the Governor-General, his staff and a
number of aldermen, importers, squatters,
solicitors, commission agents, property-
owners and other kindred spirits. It may
well be that a priceless treatise on “The
Properties and Causation of Acute Bore-
dom” will he the outcome of this entertain-
ment.
Melba’s Westralian company is tempo-
rarily “resting”—as the profesli puts it when
it is out of a job. Doris Madden is here,
also pianist Harold Whittle ; but McEacharn,
the baritone whom I tokl you about last
week, lias gone to Sydney. lie will pr ibably
appear later on with Melba. Meanwhile he
persists rashly in wearing a presentation lie-
pin. which flashes the Star’s name in dia-
monds. With the Sydney crime-wave in
its present state it is simply asking for
trouble to wear such a gaud, but these bari-
tones are a reckless, devil-may-care lot.
May Vale Gilfillan is showing portraits
from August 4 to the end of the week in her
studios, at 483 Collins-street.
Which reminds me that during this week
and the next the Athenaeum Upper Room
booking will be given up to Hal G.ve, Percy
Lindsay. Benson and Stoekfelt. lln 1 Gye
caricatures for food but etches for fun, so
to speak. Thoughtless persons speak of him
as a cynic. If they only knew! As a
matter of fact, he has a soul —I was going
to write, like a bullock, but perhaps it hardly
expresses exactly what I mean. Any-
how, he is practically all soul. lie
hankers for some writer of Australian
Fairy Tales to let him illustrate a
book about these ethereal creatures in
colors. His best effects are got from
eucalypts and ii-tree, with twilight purples
and greys, and dark, bunyip-infested pools,
and mist-clothed valleys, and mysterious
backgrounds, and all that sort of thing.
Elsie Mackay, Fan Dango’s pretty step-
daughter, is to play the leading part in
“Grumpy,” with Cvril Maude, at the New
Theatre, London. She left Melbourne only
IS months ago to “walk on” in London. She
got a chance to understudy Mrs. Pat Camp-
bell, and Luck and Looks and Talent did the
rest.
Melba is to sing at the G.-G.’s Reception
of the Science Congressors on August 13.
So what with the drinks and one thing and
another, they should be able to face the rest
of the entertainment with a certain amount
of fortitude.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
A woman has actually been elected to the Council
of the Adelaide University. Think of it. And Capi-
tal still remains in the country! Dr. Helen Mayo,
the chosen female, is a grand-daughter of the late
Dr. Mayo, one of the best known of this State's
early medicos. She was educated at home and at
the Advanced School for Girls, and after going-
through her course at the Adelaide University and
putting in a year as house-surgeon at the Adelaide
Hospital, she went to London and Dublin, ar.d then
on to India, where for a time she had charge of St.
Stephen’s Hospital at Delhi. Arrived back in
Adelaide, she settled down to serious Work, feeling
that her life hitherto had perhaps been a shade too
much on the frivolous side. In her leisure moments
she looks after the School for Mothers, the Babies’
Hospital, the Women's Students’ Club and the Women
Graduates’ Union.
On Wednesday the Symon dame and Mrs. Miller
entertained members of the Poetry Recital Society at
the May Club. “Esther,” a play by an at present
unknown South Australian writer, was read relent-
lessly from cover to cover by Mrs. Miller, who got
considerable moral support from a becoming gar-
ment of dull blue charmeuse and a rose-bedecked hat.
Her accomplice was in black. Dr. Souter and his
wife, the Rev. W. 11. and Mrs. Winter, Miss Prim-
rose, Miss Hammett Dyer, Mrs. .Tames Booth, Mrs.
Cleland, Miss Craigie and others of our tame poets
and men and women of letters were among the
uplifted.
Yet another musical reception—this time to Harold
Bauer at the Rubeo on Friday evening, and again
with the Adelaide Chamber Music Society as the
host. Mrs. Magarey, who received with the presi-
dent and vice-president, was an eminently successful
pale green admixture of satin and ninon with a
bunch of violets at the waist line. Most of musical
Adelaide was there.
Miss Rhoda Hanson, whose marriage to Mr. Mal-
colm Murray will shortly take place, is spending a
few days with Mr. and Mrs. Grundy at Victor
Harbor. Mrs. Tennant is another of the party.
Mrs. James Harvey has gone for a trip to Queens-
land.
The old Leawood garden has been taken over by
Miss Eva Laughton and Miss E. de Mole, who intend
to work it as an orchard and also as a flower-farm
and tea-garden. If English and American reports
can be believed, women gardeners usually do well,
and the few who have made tentative experiments in
Australia seem to be making steady headway.
Mrs. Woodhead and her daughter left for England
last week. The Arthur Waterhouses swell the list of
“departeds” next week, and Miss Deely goes at the
end of September. That is to say these departures
will occur if General War doesn’t object. A whole
lot of little details of our social life will depend
on the whim of General War.
Florence Itodway’s exhibition of portraits
in pastel comes due at the Athenaeum Gal-
lery on August 19, and Florence herself will
get to Melbourne a week before the event.
She intends to hang some 30 or 40 portraits
and studies for portraits that are mostly
borrowed from the buyers thereof, so the
exhibition, commercially speaking, will be
rather a show of samples to book orders
from than a display of pictures for sale.
Fidelity of likeness is a strong point in Miss
Rodway’s charming work, and this will at
once appeal to all Melbourne moneyed women
who know the Sydney originals of any of
the portraits. The tall winsome pasteleuse
is bound to get the commissions she is
coming for. To look at the people she has
pictured is to want to be one more of them.
And the few unsold specimens of Rodway art
will surely be snapped up by local connois-
seurs.
The Down-Trodden Females’ League, or
some other shamefully ill-used body of the
sort, has given Vida Goldstein a motor-car,
in order that she may pursue the elusive
vote-fowl on equal terms with Man. Also,
Mrs. Gregan McMahon Inis worked a
Woman’s Banner for unfurlment purposes at
meetings and so on. The banner is, I hear,
a huge silk thing with Australia’s dag in
one corner, and in another (though of this
I am not absolutely sure) a representation
of Man Rampant and Lovely 'Woman utterly
spurning him.
A children’s Fancy Dress Ball in aid of
the Epileptic Home for the Young will
simmer or boil —according to how tickets
go off —at St. Kilda Town Ilall on August
21. Prahran’s Mayor Willis is running the
show, with a committee which includes the
George Fairbairn dame and other charitable
folks.
Mrs. Mu flic Chirnside Brown has just
emerged from a rest cure, looking 10 years
lighter and you n err than when she went in.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

WHY HAIR FALLS OUT.
THE CAUSE—AND ITS PREVENTION.
Dk. N. DUCLAUD.
Your hair falls out either because the roots
shrivel up and die, or because the scalp
relaxes and loosens its hold upon the hair
roots. This is almost invariably, due to
dandruff germs which rob the hair of its
nutrition, actually starving it to death. To
stop falling hair and prevent total or partial
baldness the dandruff germ must be de-
stroyed. For this purpose, physicians and
hair specialists now invariably prescribe a
lotion composed of i dram menthol crystals,
three ounces of bay rum, and one ounce of
lavona de Rub well into the scalp
with the fingertips, and every dandruff germ
will be destroyed within two or three days.
The hair will stop falling out and. begin to
°tow at an amazing rate, and brittle and
scanty hair will ouickly become soft glossy
and luxuriant. The $5
use of this formula are so tiuly remarKame
“hat I strongly advise every reader who*
hair falls out to give it a trial at once.

Somebody lately, started the rumor that the
A.B.C. was going to put up its dividend at
once. Seeing that a new G.M. had just
taken the bridge, this looked as unlikely as
it has turned out to be. All the same, .as
soon as the new man has got the hang of
things, and feels quite sure that ordinary
contingencies are being amply provided for
apart from the sums put to formal reserve, he
may be trusted to do something. Another
i p.c. to go on with will call for (say)
£3OOO, and the average lay-by for the past
two years, when 3 p.c. has been paid, has
been £9350 per term; so there is a very fair
margin to work on. The business is growing,
too: —

The inscribed deposits, carrying 4 p.c., are
practically perpetual: at any rate, the bank
can have the money as long as it likes, ex-
cept that it has to put by £15,000 each half-
year (not necessarily out of profits) to buy
up the debt. Nowadays, with money fairly
dear, this big 4 p.c. liability is no burden;
but under different circumstances it easily
might be. In short, a big loan at a fixed
rate of interest means erratic profits—very
fine and large when other people have to
pay dear for money, and very poor when the
bank has to lend out the dear money at a
cheap rate.' Still the fact that the money is
fixed is a great advantage to other depositors,
because, if anything goes wrong, they
have the first cut at the assets. At present
the bank has £3,222.720 of these new liabili-
ties, and besides the advances and premises
(together over £4,450,000) there is £1,770,849
in liquid assets. The depositor who wants
better security than that ought to have been
a pawnbroker.
What the A.B.C. wants most, and what
it seems to be now getting, is a bigaer borrow-
ing connection. This naturally takes a little
time to wqrk up. Throughout the weary
years when A. P. Stewart and the others
were working off the mob of old dead horses
you wouldn’t pick the A.J.S. to go to for an
advance. In fact, it got a bad advt., be-
cause even those who had old deposits
couldn’t get much accommodation, as a rule.
But the old dead horses have gone (the staff
did a rather neat thing when it presented
Stewart wi+h a live horse to mark the pass-
ing-out of Hie final corpse) : and to-day the
applicant' doesn’t find the place a freezing
chamber. Still, it has got a good way to go
yet before It has as much out in advances
p.c. of capital as the very prosperous hanks:

The foundations are ready for another
£3,000,000 of business —good, solid founda-
tions, too. When the A.B.C. secures it, as-
suming the management is sound, the
shareholders will be getting a return as good
as the security for their principal now seems
to be. At present the security is excellent
and the return wretched.

Australia Hotel Co. (Sydney).—This
c 0.,. which owns Sydney’s biggest thing in
residential pubs, has had its 23rd meeting;
and from the heights of its present affluence
it can look back on a strange, eventful his-
tory. The building, with the land and neces-
sary outfit, cost well on to £300,000. Most
of the capital came from London. For some
years the thing was a frost. In those days
Australia was crawling out from the wreck-
age of the broken boom, and the sixpenny
hash-house of Antonio Schnappero was more
in its line than the palace in Castlereagh-
street. There was a plaster of over £125,000
on the premises, and the London co. felt so
bad. about it that the directors wrote the share
capital down to a poor little £25,000. Gradu-
ally Australia got its chin off its chest, and
not only did business improve for this co.,
but there was a big recovery in the value
of the freehold. Still the London people
were very nervous—apparently they had
begun to hear vague stories of the Aus-
tralian wowser —and that and the operations
of the local-option party combined with
other things to make them eager sellers when
an offer was put before them four years
ago. The co.’s finances soon underwent a
complete change. The big mortgage was
paid off, partly by an issue of £33,000 worth
of pref. shares; and the ordinary capital was
increased to £75,000, partly by the issue of
bonus shares to absorb accumulated profit.
Profits during the past three years have
been: —June, 1912, £31,314 (including cer-
tain special profits—apparently contingency
funds no longer required) ; 1913, £24,237;
1914, £22,741. These amounts are exclusive
of sums put by to various renewal and re-
pair reserves. Including additions to these
the profits in the past year were £25,041.
The 6 p.c. prefs. took £1980: 3s. a share (on
all shares, whether paid to 20s. or 10s.), re-
quired £15,000. There was thus £BO6l to
strengthen the various reserves, which now
stand: Formal reserve, £16,000; furniture
renewal, £6500; machinery renewal, £4000;
special repair reserve, £6000; unappropri-
ated, £4624. Total, £37,124. But their
exact nature is not disclosed. If they are
merely to provide for the renewal of things
which are becoming worn or obsolete, then
they are not true reserves, and the addi-
tions made to them are not true profits.
But there is some doubt about this. Any-
way, the co. has made very extensive im-
provements during the past two or three
years, and the cost has been charged neither
to capital nor to a reserve account, but
against working exes. This 'suggests that
things are as good as they look, and perhaps
better. But whether things will continue as
good depends on the price of wool, the rain-
fall at Thargomindah, and a lot of other
extraneous things. The co.’s finances are
now very easy. On June 30 it owed alto-
gether £24,533, and liquid assets amounted
to £12,032.

When the office was. started in 1904 the State
said it could have £lOO,OOO to go on with.
All it actually took was £2000; and it made
so good a start that it never wanted any
more, and during the past year it paid back
even that little lot. Its premiums last year
were £59,418; so its reserves are equal to
110 p.c. of the premiums, and though 210
p.c. would be better, still the chances of the
office having to fall back on the State for
any of the £lOO,OOO are, as the manager
says, exceedingly remote. And, given ordi-
nary luck, the reserves should go on increas-
ing fast. The private co. does very well in-
deed if it puts by its underwriting profit, and
absorbs in dividends only the interest on its
investments. But this office has no share or
loan capital to pay dividend on; so not only
the underwriting profit but the interest on
investments as well is available for reserves.
The reserve funds are in public securities
(£45,250) and deposits, and the interest
earnings last year were £1863. The balance
of the income—£59,418 —came from premi-
ums ; so the loss rate last year was a reason-
able 47.1 p.c. and the expense rate an ex-
tremely moderate 26.7 p.c. As a matter of
fact, the expense rate at the start was too
small. Like many another State business
concern, this office wouldn’t pay enough for
special capacity, and almost invariably as soon
as it had got hold of a good man and proved
him good, some private co. grabbed him at
about double the money. The office is now
trying to wipe out that stain, first by paying
a bit more straight out and then by introduc-
ing a sort of profit-sharing system. There
is unquestionably a big field ahead of the
staff. So far the aggregate premiums are
nothing tremendous; thousands of insurers
who encouraged this office to be born were
quite satisfied to leave their business with
the old offices as soon as the latter hurriedly
reduced their premiums. But the fact that
this office can’t possibly go bung unless the
whole country goes bung must tell in the
long run; and the idea of his whole country
going bung is one that the immensely pat-
riotic Maorilander is about the last person
in the world to entertain.

Automatic Telephones (Australasia),
Ltd., formed in Sydney with a goodwill of
£5OOO to introduce the Strowger and Keith
patents to Australasia :

1913 567 567 4430
1914 .. 4361 7i p.c. = £3750 611 3819
The co. is the agent of the Automatic Elec-
tric Co., of Chicago. It apparently paid
nothing to get the business: it merely put up
£10.500 as a guarantee that 10.000 lines
would be ordered before June, 1914. The
original agents—the Standard-Waygood En-
gineering Co., it seems —passed the represen-
tation on to this co. in exchange for 100,000
deferred shares of Is. each. To provide
working capital, 100,000 ordinaries have
been issued; they are of £l, paid now to 10s.
These ordinaries are entitled to a first 10
p.c. p.a.; the ordinaries and deferreds halve
the balance. The first year was mostly spent
in talking ; in the second year contracts were
entered into with the Commonwealth to
equip the Perth and four suburban ex-
changes ; and just before the third year
closed tenders for seven more were accepted.
The £10,500 deposit is thus all right: it goes
towards paying for material. What this co.
gets out of the business hasn’t been dis-
closed —presumably only a commission. Any-
way, it is still the Chicago people’s agent,
though it has to do the financing. The direc-
tors say: “The current year should be a
busy one [in view of the contract for the
seven exchanges], affording profitable em-
ployment for the co.’s capital, the bulk of
which is lying at call. Under a new agency
agreement with Automatic Electric Co.
better terms have been arranged, and a much
longer period granted upon reasonable con-
ditions” —this as the result of managing-
director Nicholson’s visit to America. It
looks as though every telephone exchange
will be made automatic; but exchanges are
not legion, and the big transformation job
won’t last many years. After that, unless,
of course, the co. gets some of the revenue
from royalty (and it isn’t likely to be
allowed much of that), the co.’s income will
slump badly. Meantime, however, unless the
holders of other patents butt in hard, it is
likely to show very fine profits. Also, it has
this advantage: when there’s no more work
to do, the capital, on present appearances,
will be available. Of the £50,000 paid in
cash £42,726 is still in that substance or
short loans, and the balance is represented
by work in progress (which is just about as
good as cash) and a few trifles.

That’s an unsatisfactory table, and nobody
knows it better than the carpenter who made
it. The capital was originally £17,500, of
which all but £2500 was represented by good-
will ; and the latter wasn’t written down,
though the lease was racing to its end. When
the end came the landlord granted an exten-
sion only on condition that the co. spent
£5063 on improvements to his property. This
brought the goodwill items up to actually
more than the capital. In other words, the
co. owed more than the value of its tangible
assets. Then a bit more capital was got in
and £8750 was written off; and as at June,
1912, when things were thus cleaned up,
£9044 of the capital of £12,250 was repre-
sented by paper assets. Since then £3OO a half-
year has been written off; but it has been
written off tangible and intangible assets
ia a lump, and tangible and intangible assets
are also lumped in the balance-sheet. If
£5O a half-year is enough to write off the
furniture, then £250 has been written off the
intangible assets; and in that case the de-
ficit is £1250 less than the table alleges.
Better, therefore, put it this way:—
1912. 1914.
Assets apart from goodwill, lease,
and furniture .. •• £1417 £3348
Liabilities . . . . . . . ■ 993 952
Surplus .. .. .. £424 £2396
So in two years, while a p.c. div. has
been paid, the more or less liquid assets have
improved by £1972, or at the rate of £986 a
year; and if the co. can keep that up it will
easily have the whole capital in hand in
hard assets by the time the lease runs out in
1930. In fact, if the surplus shrank by one-
lialf, the thing could still be just managed.
There are now 35,000 shares paid to 75.;
and though the security is very poor, the
return is irnry fine, and the chances of a
refund of capital excellent —always assuming
reasonably good management, which in pub-
running consists chiefly of knowing exactly
what the tripe and the toothpicks and the
mustard are costing.

Eyre Peninsula Petroleum Oil Co. has
started boring at Wanilla, 17 miles from
Port Lincoln (S.A.). The plant, by Hor-
wood and Co., of Adelaide, is designed to
drill to 3500 ff. The co. is acting on the
advice of Dr. Basedow, who stated that the
three necessary conditions for oil were
present: (1) Sufficient carbonaceous material
from which oil can be formed ; (2) the geo-
logical structure; and (3) porous rocks over-
lain by a sufficient thickness of impervious
rocks. T. J. Whaley has started borii.g
five miles from Kingston (S.A.), assisted by
six Californian oil-drillers.
Covent Garden, London.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
fog shuts in the reek of soot,
Of sleepy walls and gloomy;
But here there lurks a breath of fruit,
Of pricking bud, of sappy root,
And fields lush-green and roomy.
Sham. quivering cries and rolling wheels
The mist has tried to deaden ;
Yet Spring trips in with restless heels,
And through a madcap dance she reels
To make the apples redden.
Faint as the light a far lamp throws
Set in some vine-fleeced tower,
Where last night’s buried sunbeam glows,
Great bunches of exiled primrose
Along the wet stalls, flower.
And by their fog-blurred ranks I found
(The ripe fruits lured him most!),
Sprung like a genie from the ground,
His dun cloak folded closely round
A friar’s pensive ghost!
He left behind the skies austere.
The gates of pearl and gold,
To tread a faltering measure here,
Down ways familiarly dear
In monkish days of old!
A garden full of leafy trees
Was once this city square ;
And, rising from his gouty knees,
The abbot bland would take his ease
When blackbirds chiriuped there.
A dial carved with warning words
Taught piety was all,
And vanity the pipe of birds,
And lilies white as milkmaids’ curds
That lean against the wall,
And vanity the rose that grew
And scent and sap and root,
And vanity the bough that threw
Its green and gold across the blue,
Prest down with swelling fruit.
A penance was the friar set —
He had forgot the sin.
The penance seemed to chasten yet,
Nor Heaven had taught him to forget
The sweets the rind shuts in.
Perhaps he stole the round, pink peach
The abbot had marked down.,
As thirsty as some thready leech,
He found it, high and out of reach,
And climbing, tore his gown.
What use to bend a tonsured head
In muttered, hasty prayer?;
The abbot bland his guilt had read
Through fingers o’er betrayal spread
lie saw the fateful tear!
“The sin of covetousness” (of course
’Twas different with the prior),
“The sin of greed” (the abbot’s loss),
His fingers held the wooden cross,
His keen eye held the friar.
The punishment to fit the crime,
Stamp self out branch and root,
The friar at refection time
Could have one green and bitter lime
But no ripe summer fruit.
The vagrant wasp might prick the grape
To draw the germ of wine;
Wild birds could make the red skins gape,
The bee was free in blossom rape
To drink his draught divine.
But, in a narrow, whitewashed cell,
A very humbled friar
Must gird his soul to make it well,
For self-indulgence leads to Hell,
And Hell springs from desire!
Perhaps he heard the nightingale
In bosky ways beyond;
Perhaps he guessed the moonlight pale,
Unrolling like a lady’s veil
Across the sheltered pond.
Man-born he had his human needs.
His holiness to leaven.
What matter now? He told his beads,
And. guessing at his life, one ; reads
His altitude in Heaven!
’Twixt bounty heaped from fiHd and grove
He turned and looked at me,
A shadow where the shadows move,
A ghost come back perhaps tq prove
That all i.s vanity!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.

Hit. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN,—
You do me great honor by calling upon me to speak here to-night.
I support tire toast oE my friend with the greatest pleasure that I have ever experienced at any gathering in my
business career. The world is full of men who know how to run the other fellow’s business, but we are short of men
who carr take a business of their own and run it successfully. And I say that the men who guide the destinies of
Chateau Tanunda Limited are trained protagonists of the new spirit of trade—the spirit w uti lecogmscs rat
there is a large element of science even in the smallest transaction of barter and trade.
In all the world the one desire of everything, animate or inanimate, is to be supreme. The reason is plain--
the greater the supremacy the greater tire reward. Every single stalk in a field of wheat strives to thrust its head
above the others, so that it may be the first to catch the rays of the morning sun.
And o-entlemen, the directors of Chateau Tanunda Limited have met with a reward that they deserve. Tue
service they have done this great country in the development of the Brandy Industry is one that cannot be igmy
passed over. This Company, over twenty years ago, mt out to produce a brandy that would favorably compare wun
the finest foreign spirit.' And what have they done? They have, in my opinion, gone one better nr their march of
prom-ess, and made a better, a purer, a more mellow and a finer brandy than is being made m or out of Australia
to-day. not excepting the best foreign productions. To know of the wonders of our own land is a duty as well as a
privilege, and not to know the great and romantic building, the Chateau at Tanunda, m South Austialia, is to
ignorant of one of Australia’s greatest and most costly enterprises.
Mr Chairman and gentlemen, with the greatest cordiality and feelings of friendship towards my friends—the
company of Messrs. Chateau Tanunda Limited, I support the toast.

“JEsculapius”: In ancient Greece they used to
erect temples over natural springs and give to each
a titular diety. We moderns are no less appreciative
of the healthful virtues of a mineral water —only our
methods differ somewhat. For instance, up at the
famous Helidon Spring, the water is secured fust as
it bubbles up from the earth, and hermetically sealed
until the process of aeration and bottling is com-
plete. You don’t need a Greek fineness of palate to
appreciate the cool charm of Helidon Spa—it has
the same delicious refreshingness to Billjim as to the
Earl of Ilopetoun. As a blender with wines and
spirits, too, it gives just that added snap and
sparkle that counts so much in the sum of pleasant-
ness. You’ll be wise to always make it a practice to
“Figaro”: Read a par. here the other week about
Nature planting the giant stinging nettle in N.Q.,
but close beside it the tree whose leaves serve as an
antidote to its sting. This provision of Nature is
in no w ; ay unique, for, just as she curses us with
indigestion so she blesses us with Helidon Spa.
After dining out you’ll have no next morning head-
ache if you take a bottle of “Helidon” before turning
in—this delicious mineral water is Nature’s gift to
those who have dined not wisely but too well. A single
glass will dissolve the undigested food and at the
same time ensure a perfect night’s rest. Quite apart
from its health aspect, “Helidon” greatly enhances
the flavor of wines and spirits—so truly the way 0 f
wisdom is always to
SPLIT IT WITH
HELIDON.
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
AN UNREASONABLE DEMAND.
MOTORIST (after unsuccessful attempt to nego-
tiate drunk): “Why don't you walk on
the footpath? ”
DRUNK: "'Shink I'm Bloudin?”
“Snell”: I don’t know what you think,
but to my mind it’s the limit. Two neighboring
wives in my locality were discussing intimate family
affairs recently. Mrs. Dash is a domesticated little
body, with a fair batch of children, and is usually to
be seen behind a white apron in hot pursuit of
household duties. Mrs. Nextdoor is quite another
kind of busybody, being much abroad in quest of
mysteries, decorated with an impressive pair of spec-
tacles and carrying a bunch of mixed literature. Said
she to Mrs. Dash: “No, my dear, I simply can’t think
of having children. They would interfere too much
with my church duties!”
“Black Swan”: Some figures for the
believer in a White Australia to pin in his hat. In
the pearling industry on the Nor’-West Coast at the
present moment 342 luggers are engaged, of which
300 are registered at Broome, 12 at Onslow and 30
at lloeburne. These are manned by 30S white men,
and 2388 Asiatics and colored brothers generally.
Time was when every lugger carried at least one
white man —usually shell-openers—but now each
carries only part of a white man, and next
year the fraction is pretty certain to be reduced.
Over 1381 tons of shells were raised in the year, and
putting this at an average price of £240 a ton we
have a total of £331,440, nine-tenths of which has
gone into alien pockets. And the introduction of
boats with motor power of one kind or another will
enable the harvesters to gather more crop and so still
further enrich and strengthen those whom the White
Australian has most to fear.

The public gets its leg well pulled when-
ever there's a bit of land to be ballotted for in
N. S. Wales, and the Fat landlord with an estate to
subdivide or sell to the Government sits on his fence
and smiles. The latest instance is the announcement
that 1900-odd applications have been received for five
plots of land at Mirrool, in lliverina. They come
from all parts of the State and Victoria and S. Aus.,
says the pop-eyed paragraphist. Of course they do.
Nineteen-twentieths of the applicants never saw the
land, and don’t know whether they could make a
living on it or not. All they know is that they get
it for the first five years rent free, being merely
required to spend £6O or so a year on improvements,
and at the end of that time they can sell their
right to occupy the land for ever, the incoming man
having to pay a rent of only a few pence per acre.
So the successful applicants get rent free the use of
the land for five years, and then they have every
reason to expect that they will be able to sell it for
about £4 per acre. (Freehold thereabouts is worth
£7 or so.) They don’t have to put up any deposit:
all they have to do is to send £1 to an agent who
will book them a ticket in the sweep, put up the
necessary deposit, and attend the drawing. Agents
have their clients just like any other promoter, and
at every drawing they flood the country with prospec-
tuses of the new sweep. The amazing thing is that
the number isn’t more nearly 19,000 than 1900. Then
the papers yell about land-hunger, and the real land-
hunter, who has a poor chance in the bloated consul-
tation, turns to the private subdivision fiend, and
finds that the price of his land has been put up
another ss. an acre on the strength of the bogus
extraordinary demand for farms.
“Pick”: “Tamai” (B. 9/7/T4) apparently
thinks that all bush-ticks are identical. Not so.
Cattle, gohanna and dog ticks are totally dissimilar
in size, color and virulence. Like the wallaby tick
and parasites that hold their squattages on the
hides of many other bush animals, the ticks that
infest snakes, goliannas and the sixth-day creation
generally are non-venomous, and a gohanna may,
therefore, have every scale of his squirming length
fringed with the encumbrance without danger to life.
But the blue-bottle tick that attacks dogs will, if
fastened to a vital spot, create a fever in the victim
usually fatal and at all times paralysing in its
effects. Cattle ticks are brown in color, flat and
with a wedge-shaped head. They appear to attack
cattle and horses only, and when numerously con-
gregated upon a beast invariably cause the marble to
be passed in. Talking of cattle ticks, has any abo.
ever met one travelling any direction other than
southward ? Old hands in Queensland, and on the
far northern rivers of N.S.W., earn most of their
beer by laying odds on a tick-walking trial. The
tick is placed on a slab, and no matter in what
direction it (tick or slab) is turned, the insect will
immediately head south and stumble onward over
all obstructions and tick regulations. It is, there-
fore, only a matter of time until they will walk
into the fancied security of the South Coast, and
there will be something beside rumors in the air on
that day.
“Ivuscobin” : Of all native races, dentists
say that Henare takes the biscuit for sound teeth,
the percentage of decay among the Maoris being only
1.7 per cent. It was first believed that thiswas due
to a weakness (not so long back) for human flesh,
but the bottom fell out of this theory when it was
pointed out that long pig was tabu to the women
and only given sparingly to the elder boys, while
the teeth were equally good at all ages and in both
sexes. Another scientific highbrow then came for-
ward with the theory that the cause of it all was
the amount of sand taken with the food, adducing
as evidence in support the fact that the Maori ovens
were mostly located in sand dunes. But we know
that Henare used to wrap his game up in green
leaves before steaming it, and also covered the fires
over with mats—-so the sand theory was mere scien-
tific imagination. Not to be beaten, this same
authority then explained that the chewing of coarse,
fibrous food was the cause. This, too, was just so
much hot-air, for Henare’s fern-root flour had all
the fibres removed before being made into dough,
whilst the kumara, or sweet potato, cooks to a soft,
powdery mass. The latest reason put forth is that
Henare was a bit of an epicure in his way. All his
staple foods were distinctive in flavor—fish and game,
kumara and fern roots, fruit and berries. Of the
latter it is pointed out that tutu berries were in
great request, and “tutin,” the active principle of
these, causes intense salivation. It is to plentiful
saliva that modern dentistry ascribes the fine ivories
of the Maori. But here’s a point still unaccounted
for. Henare to-day lives mostly on strong grog and
motor-car joy-rides, yet his teeth are as good as
ever. My theory is that a good spree, with joy rides
to lend variety, is the finest of all dentifrices.” When
my rich uncle kicks the bucket I’m going to prove it.
WAITING FOR THE DOCTOR.
REVEREND GENT: “You ought to be ashamed of yoursalf idling there all the day long.”
THIRSTY BOB (with Jeeling): “Well, yer see, I'm a sort of outdoor patient of this 'ere
establishment, an' I'm awaitin' treatment."
“Centauri”: The black dismounted and
commenced attacking the butt of a hollow, stunted
coolibah with his tomahawk. A few chops and the
implement was into the rotten inner shell, through
which he pushed his finger, and a stream of yellowish
fluid squirted out. Cupping his hands, the abo. drank
about three pints, and then I drew about a quartpot
full. The liquid smelt not unlike sulphuric acid, and
tasted worse. Altogether, there was about 10 gal-
lons in this natural reservoir. The catchment area
seems to be the hollow limbs of the tree, down
which the stormwater flowed into the tank below.
“Chloe”: The Chinese, Japs and Malays
of Nor’-West Australia and the Malay States all
play a game with bowl and chopsticks like that
described by “F.Y.7” (B. 16/7/’l4). But they do
not call it fantan. They have a species of roulette wheel,
much on the principle of the European affair, and
they back the color in the same way. In another
game small discs, with insect, reptile, bird or fisb,
etc., marked on the face, are put into a bowl. The
players sit round the table. Each player backs his
fancy for a place, first and last drawing an equal
prize. The bowl is then fitted with a lid, swirled
round a time or two, and the discs trickle through an
aperture. There is as much row in the room while
the discs are pouring through as on Flemington
when the horses come up the straight. The writer
lived for some time in Port Hedland, and could
look down from the verandah into a den of this
kind. The Chinese played all night, going back to
hotel or laundry at daylight. They played 364
nights of the year. They missed Chinese New Year’s
Night, when they had fireworks instead. The gam-
ing instinct is so strong in the Celestial that they
even back their crackers, betting which will explode
first. Do the Chinese ever sleep ? That problem I
have never solved. In Singapore the coolie Chinese
work all day and all night in the tailors’ shops and
the laundries, whilst their employers gamble. In
Broome you can go into the Chow quarter at any
hour of the night or early morning, and by the
always-open windows of laundry or tailor’s shop you
can see drowsy Chinamen ironing or sewing, each
probably making sleepy bets with his neighbor as to
the number of buttons on the next garment, or any
other futile thing on which they can hang a wager.
One hotel cook has never been at home a night dur-
ing the four years of his term of service. TTe will
only cease from gambling when he is dead. An
unfair feature of the business is that the lower caste
are under indenture to the higher ; so a poor wretch
of a dhoby or punkah-wallah is obliged to hand over
all his earnings to pay up the losses of a rapacious
superior. And he invariably gets kicked for not
having won or saved more.
“Dulamakau”: The Papuan is an adept
in preparing his brother man for consumption, and
is as skilled at “cutting up” as any appendicitis
sawyer. Since cold storage is not available, partial
cooking is utilised as a preservative. Except where
civilisation has brought along the steel knife, the
cutting up is done with a knife of bamboo, which
the Papuan handles with astonishing slickness, re-
sharpening his weapon by peeling a sliver oif the

THE DEATH OF EVA: MODERN VERSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Children of three and four years of age openly
defied their parents, who praised" the spirit in a boy
that prompted him to hick his fathers shins and
curse his mother to her face. The same canker, said
the preacher, was to be found in the homes of the
wealthy, where parents were not revered, but were
rather tolerated by their children.
—Heartrending news item.
The Beautiful Child lay near to death;
The household watched her with sobbing breath.
Son 1.
“O Eva, Eva!” moaned the mother, sore grief-
stricken ;
“Don’t leave your mummer!” “Gain!” she mur-
mured ; “Dicken !”
And here she raised herself, her mild eyes beaming,
And gazed lovingly at her Ma’s face, where-down the
teais were streaming;
With one thin, white, delicate finger she pointed
Straight in her mother’s face, with Creme de Juno
anointed,
And cried impressively: “Ow, Ma! look at them
wrinkles on j’er forrid i
My! you do look a sight—yer a fair nark —yes, and
’orrid!
AYodger want ter tork about dyin’ for? / ain’t

Say I want ’im; if ’e don’t come I’ll kick ’im

(Enter Eva’s father.)
“Me child! Mo child!” (Bedside rush, stretched,
arms, and an agonised expression.)
Eva : “OW, come orf. Yer silly ol’ geeser—’ ere
chuck it. (Pa tries to kiss her!)
I never (cough) seen such a ol’ pot. Wot’s struck
it,
D’jer bring them peanuts, pop?”
Pa: “Yes, yes, my dearyj
Here they are” (Gives them to her.)
Eva (suspiciously): “My word, pop, you do

I do believe (looks into bag), yer mean ol’ cow.
yer bin a-pinching ’em !
and yer ! Wot parients ! It’s me fer

We have received from the Board of Directors of the
REGENT PALACE HOTEL,
PICCADILLY CIRCUS, LONDON,
The following order, dated 6th February, 1914.
“ Messrs. BEALE & COMPANY LTD., Sydney, Australia.
“ The object of this letter to-day is that we wish you to make, on account of the Strand Hotel Co. Ltd., to
be used in the Regent Palace Hotel, now in course of erection at Piccadilly Circus :
' “ One full-sized Concert Grand Piano, in burr walnut, in the latest model, with just sufficient exterior
ornamentation to be dignified. We think it unnecessary to give you any instructions as to quality,
etcetera, as you will know how to supply an article of the best, and you can put on the inside of the lid of
the piano (if you care to) ‘ Made expressly for the Regent Palace Hotel, London, by Beale & Co. Ltd.,
Sydney, N.S. W., Australia .’ ”
11 If the contractors keep to their time, the Regent Palace Hotel will be open by October next. It will be
the largest hotel, we think we may say, in Europe, having between one thousand and eleven hundred bedronns.
If you can possibly do it, will you let us have the piano here for the opening of the House; if not, please let us
know in due course, so that an arrangement can be made for the temporary hire of one.”
npHE order came to us entirely unsolicited and unexpected. There can be no doubt
that it is meant as a compliment to Australia, for the STRAND PALACE
1 HOTEL, filled from the day of its opening, has had a great many guests from
this Hemisphere. It is to be expected that its immense popularity will he even exceeded
by that of the colossal caravanserai, the REGENT PALACE HOTEL, built upon
an “island” site at Piccadilly Circus, therefore light, safe and airy. Anything under the
able management of the Directors of J. LYONS & CO. is sure to win the confidence
and approval of the public, for their enterprises are the most conspicuous success of modern
times in the World’s metropolis. Their one inflexible rule has always been: “Everything of
the verv best and absolutely genuine.” No tips are allowed, no secret commissions, all
above-board and in favor of the public. And so in return they get public favor.
Beale & Co. Ltd. have repeatedly supplied Grand and Upright Pianos to these splendid
institutions. The amusing part is that we have "been virulently attacked by the German
trade Press for thus invading Europe with high-priced pianos, because they reckon to
hold a mortgage over the piano-supply of Great Britain and of Australia in particular.
Beale Pianos are made by us only, sold under our own name only, and when they are offered without our name be
sure it is a fraud.
20,000 BEALE PIANOS have been made by us in Australia.
Where easy terms are required we issue a free life policy, so that in case of death the instrument becomes the property
of the customer without any further payment, thus removing anxiety in time of trouble.
The Beale Factories are the largest of their kind in the British Empire, and are under the direction of one of the
world’s greatest experts, Major George D. Rose.

The Maoriland Government is being urged
to do something to protect the native birds on Niue,
one of the Cook Islands. And not before it was time.
The native idea of being up to date is to buy a
gun from a trader and then go into the bush and
slaughter as many pigeons, doves and parrakeets as
he can while the ammunition lasts. The result is
that the very birds that are badly needed to keep the
insect pests in check are being rapidly and insanely
killed off. This has already happened at Rarotonga,
and a wild yell is now going up from that island for
quantities of foreign bird to be imported at great
expense to gobble up the exceedingly numerous insect
that afflicts that earthly paradise. It is suggested
that the importation of firearms and ammunition into
Niue be prohibited. Another pbace where the same
rule should apply is Stewart Island, at the southern
end of Maoriland. This is practically a bush-clad,
scenic reserve, about 40 miles across and with 20
miles ;of stormy sea between it and the mainland.
It would make an ideal sanctuary. Most of the
delightful fowl of Maoriland are still to be found
on the island, but hopeless, holiday lunatics go there
in large numbers in the summer and spend their
time slaying harmless tuis, wekas, bell birds and
even the cute little bush robin that is so tame that
it will hop on to the barrel of the gun and have a
peep down the muzzle. Unless the State wakes up
and deals with these so-called “sports” lOTJ Land
will shortly find itself without any of its feathered
natives. What’s the matter with an open season for
shooting “sports” ?
* * * *
“Snell”: Three times within a fortnight
in three distinct oyster hells I have seen damage
done to hard “knuts” by mere waiters; and I take
this opportunity of advising gay devils, night owls,
toughs and naughty boys generally to be more
Broosmithian in their treatment of waiters and bar-
men than they have found necessary in the past. The
fact is proprietors of establishments where the
“knuts” assemble have found it advisable to have
at least one waiter on the premises who can put it
across wayward youth when wayward youth is full
of stout and oyster cocktails, and burning for the
fray. Hence a demand for used-up pugilists. To
see nice, upstanding lads, with a few of the rudi-
ments of fist fighting, egrcgiously man-handled by a
low-heeled waiter in a slopped vest is as pitiful a
spectacle as to behold leopards bitten to death by a
sheep. I think restaurant-keepers who have an
ex-professional slugger on their staff should be com-
pelled to hang out a warning note —“Beware of the
Pug!”
* * . * *
“Moana”: Another little sample of the
kind of endurance and pluck they breed in the bush.
A man named Worsley, working at tree-felling in
the centre of the North Island (M.L.), 20 miles from
anywhere, had one of his thighs smashed through a
tree falling on him. This happened late in the after-
noon, and at five o’clock the other eight men in the
camp started to carry the damaged brother over the
rough and mountainous bush country to Raurimu,
on the Main Trunk line. After doing five miles they
secured a trap, but the country was so rough that
it broke down and had to be abandoned. -So they
took to the carrying again. The night was pitch
dark and cold, but they kept steadily at it, some-
times through dense bush, at other times over rough
clearings of piled up logs and frequently through
creeks and along tracks where they were up to their
knees in mud. It was a worn-out and done-up crew
that struggled into Raurimu early next morning and
put the injured man on the train for the Hamilton
hospital. I didn’t hear that they got a medal for
the act. Probably all the medals had been used
up to reward members of the bowling club or the
winner of the billiard tournament.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
“And what's become of your male —that tall
fellow with the red and black swag?”
"Oh, poor B.ll! ’E wuz took to Callan Park
free munee ago! ”
"What! Was he mad?”
"Well, ' e weren't exackly too pleased!”
“Lagani-Namo” : T wish to enter turtles
for fur Bulletin’s egg-laying competition. Lady
turtles think nothing of parting with 150 eggs, or
more, at a time. These eggs are the size of a golf
ball, and a remarkable thing about them is that
no matter how long - they’re boiled the yolk remains
liquid. Mrs. Turtle scrapes a hole in the sand, well
above highwater-mark, produces her fruit,- scratches
the sand back, and leaves the rest to Providence. As
the young shellbacks find themselves at liberty they
spring straight to the water. They tip the scale at
about loz. at birth, and, if nothing interferes, they’ll
keep living for several hundred years, weighing up
to even 4cwt. There is a giddy young tortoise in
Berlin, which still takes an interest in things after
213 years at the same address.
THE COLOR LINE.
G WADLYS: “What makes your nose so red, pa?"
OLD SPORT: "That is a sign that I am in the pink of condition, my dear.”
“Black Swan” : The financial cloud which
has hung over W.A. is about to lift. McLeod, M.L.A.,
said so in the Assembly the other day, and his argu-
ments as well as his figures paralysed the Opposition.
The State brickworks, now nearing completion, are, so
says Me., capable of turning out 180,000 bricks a
week, at a cost of £1 ss. per 1000. The market
price being £3 per 1000 it follows, according to Me.,
that the Government will clear at least £250,000 a
week. In other words, a fortnight will wipe out the
deficit, and the money market in London will be
entirely demoralised by Scaddan’s unexpected repay-
ment of the State loans. When the Opposition had
found its speech once more an unbelieving Thomas —
George is his real name—asked: “How much a week
did you say you were going to make out of
your brickworks?” McLeod: “We will make at least
a quarter of a million a week on an output of
180,000 bricks.” When I came to the lights were out
and everybody had gone home or somewhere.
* * * *
“Gazeeka” : In the many parts of Maofi-
land which are cursed with a superabundance of big
estates, the Californian thistle pest has reduced the
grazing area by a great deal. When the Noxious
Weeds Act was being enforced prosecutions were fre-
quent, and some of the squattocracy were compelled
to disgorge about £3OO per annum in wages to
thistle-cutters in order to comply with the regula-
tions. Two seasons agone, the squatters decided
that the enforcement of the Act was an undue hard-
ship on the small farmers, and the Massey Govern-
ment instructed its inspectors to administer the law
with discretion so as not to inflict any hardship on
the settlers. The inspectors went in for heaps of
discretion accordingly; but when the small farmers,
who were keeping the curse in check, realised that
the prolific growth of thistle on the big holdings was
a menace to their limited grazing areas they de-
manded that the Act be loaded to the muzzle and
fitted with a hair trigger. A commission of inquiry
was appointed, and the squatters explained the im-
possibility of keeping large areas free of the pest.
That was two years ago, and the Commission has not
yet presented its report. Meanwhile the “discre-
tion” of the North Island inspectors has been such
that there have been no prosecutions under the Act
relating to the Californian curse during that time.
There was a prosecution in the South Island last
season ; but I cannot say for certain whether it was
the cocky or the inspector who was fined. Anyhow,
it made no difference to the thistles.
“Kapina” : Re this diving argument, “Te
Pana’s” 134 fathoms ought to be the last word!
But 12 fathoms has been known to be done at
swim-diving in Torres Strait. Ten fathoms is a
common occurrence. The champion of the Brisbane
Gun Club for the last three or four years, when he
was a wild youth on one of the pearling schooners,
used to play a game with the Papuan crew. They
dived in turn and placed a stick through a ring of
the anchor chain. Each man had to carry the piece
of wood down and place it lower than it was before.
I, he failed to do so he had to drop out of the game.
The white man was usually the last in. Most of
them could go down over 10 fathoms.
* * * *
Bili.v i. : His feet looked like dumplings
mapped in sacking, his hat had been chewed by a
dairy herd, and you could have graded potatoes
through the old overcoat he was wearing. His nose
was blue with cold. His teeth chattered as he passed
me. He shuffled into the bar, and began to rock
mto the free lunch. He had engulfed three fish-balls
and a square block of sardine sandwiches as big as a
brick when Bung charged down on him, expostulat-
ing furiously, but with inadequate articulation. The
blue-pointer ceased masticating for one moment.
‘Are you the proprietor of this hotel?” he asked
“Yes, I am!” roared Bung. “And what do you
mean by” _ The beat stood up and shook a
wedge of Bung’s own sandwiches in Bung’s own
face. “Then why the devil, sir, don’t vou have an
electric radiator going in your infernal bar?” he said.
“A.J.8.”: The deep gulf mentioned in the
Scriptures has been dug up and dropped in between
the men engaged in the cattle and the sheep trades.
The cattle-drover—employer and employee—despises
the “monkey-dodger,” as he calls the sheep-tailer. I
saw a rattling good fight between two cattle-drovers,
all because, as one of their mates said, “the cow has
been drinking with a sheep-drover.” Another time
I was there when a cattleman rode up to our sheep
camp and inquired who was in charge of this
etcetera “mob of lice.” In the same way the beef
butcher considers it infra dig to “go on the
mutton”; but let the “mutton” man get a chance
to “go on beef” and he grabs it. lie has reached
the height of his ambition when he can “side” his
beast in “three,” or is able to take a “chain.” After
passing his exam., the meat inspector’s main desire
is to be sent to Queensland or else “put on the beef.”
The bullock is so prolific of “specimens” that he
does not mind if he gets bogged over something he
stumbles upon in the beef ; but he would reckon he
was “losing his punch” if anything in the mutton
beat him. Pigs he doesn’t like ; certainly for the
inspector there is more intricate work in pork than
in either beef or mutton, but there is less lordly
satisfaction.
* * * *
“F.Il.”: After this let all hands stop
gassing about diving. A native living at Yam Island
undertook to clear an anchor which was fouled in 11
fathoms of water. The hook belonged to a mission
boat, and it was important (on the word of the
mish) to get the vessel away that night. At 10
o’clock the boy (he was 15 years of age) went over-
board and did the job. That’s No. 1. No. 2 was a
native known as Calso. He has touched bottom at
14 fathoms and collected shell. Anybody who gives
me the harsh word does so in ignorance. lie is the
son of a monkey.
* * * *
“Moana” : A struggle is going on for a
weird sort of prohibition at Niue, one of the Cook
Islands. The drink bill there is estimated at
£3 10s. per head, but the cash isn’t directly blewed
on beer. When a native gets thirsty he toes it
up a cocoa palm, nicks a green nut, slices the
top off and drinks the milk. The Administration is
trying to break him of this old habit by placing big
iron tanks in all the villages and exhorting the brown
man to cultivate a taste for water. The loss
through wasting the nut while too immature for
copra purposes is estimated at 2000 tons per annum.
On this basis the amount done in on der-r-rink is
computed. So definite steps are being taken to
make the thirsty native leave the valuable milk
alone. But tree-climbing is man’s oldest pastime,
and cold water is hard business to push, and the
pants of the reformer are busted at the knees
through climbing up his perpendicular proposition.
* * * *
“K.Cy.”: I’ll back the Cairns hinterland
against any districts of equal extent on this planet
for variety of metalliferous ores. Taking Chillagoe
as centre and 10 miles as radius, you will find the
following ores being mined: Azurite, malachite, bor-
nite, red and black oxide and sulphide of copper;
galena, cerrusite and native silver; antimony, carb.
and sulphide, molybdenite, bismuth carb. and sulph. ;
tin, lode, “toad’s-eye” and ruby ; wolfram and scheel-
ite ; zinc, worse luck. Not to mention a number of
metals and minerals which are at present of little
or no commercial importance. Certainly no part of
Australia offers such inducements for practical pro-
spectors. Plenty of grass and water for horses are
among the advantages.
STRAIGHT!
“Talk about floods! Why, last summer the
crik rose that high that it poured down
the chimney and put me fire out."
“Boronia”: I’ve already mentioned about
20 uses for Westralia’s fine tree, the “blackboy.”
Here's another: at motor-bike races recently held
near Perth the winner almost put up a record for
fastest time under ordinary road conditions, on spirit
distilled from the heart of the vegetable. I’ve got a
bit of a bank balance to repeat that the blackboy is
the most useful thing growing in Bushtralia.
A WINTER TALE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A crowd of drinkers stood around
And lent respectful ears
To anything he cared to say,
And seemed, moreover, pleased to pay
For all his smokes and beers!
“Who is this proud and noble one?”
I asked. “What has the fellow done?”
A worshipper looked at me till '
I blushed, and felt like one
Who’s seen a blind man’s beer to steal,
Or rob a tenor of his meal,
Or kick a Jew for fun!
“Gorbli’me! that’s the bloke,” cried he,
“Who stoushed th’ ’umpire, Saturdee!”

OH, ho! So that’s the reason. You know we told you how some of our
trade friends advised us not to try to sell “De Reszke” Cigarettes to
Australians—“they have no taste for such good ones.”
Well, we’ve been looking into things, and we find that these said friends are
doing quite a nice business here, despite the fact that their trade in England
no longer exists to any degree.
No wonder they don’t want the “De Reszke” Cigarette to come “jumping in.”
It makes us feel we would like to get a little of the publicity limelight on io
their names, but —well, anyway, what does it matter?
The admission is made. The truth is out. So long as the “De Reszke” was
not offered for sale in Australia, why, Australians could not know they were
better.
“ E RESZKE” Cigarettes are not only being “offered” for sale, but are
| ) being bought by appreciative Australians, whose numbers are rapidly
increasing. Tobacconists have sold out of “De Reszkes” so quickly
that to fill their re-orders we were compelled to cable to England for trebled
supplies.
Are you one of those who have given the “De Reszke” a trial and found its
flavor finer, its aroma more pleasing, its mildness exquisitely agreeable? Or
are you one of those who are still sticking to their old brand without troubling
to find out a better Cigarette? If you are in the latter class, and want to get
into the former, the quickest way to do so is to get a box of “De Reszke”
Cigarettes from* one of the “De Reszke” Agents whose names appear below.
The “ De Reszke’ Cigarettes you buy in your own Store are identical in every way with those
that are sold in England. They are made by J. Millhoff & Co., Ltd., 86, Piccadilly, London,
England, and reach you in exactly the same condition as the smoker in England receives them.

THE CURE FOR SORE THROAT.
Everyone who suffers from sore throat should
send at once the coupon printed here, which will
bring a free supply of Wulfing’s Forinainint.
This pleasant-tasting, harmless tablet gives
immediate relief from the pain of sore throat;
cures it rapidly ; prevents further attacks ; and
safeguards the user against catching other in-
fectious diseases like diphtheria, consumption of
the lungs, scarlet fever, measles, etc.
Wulfing’s Formamint is endorsed by over
io.ooo doctors, as well as by thousands of other
people like those whose letters are printed opposite.
All Chemists sell it, price 2/6d. per bo tie, but
insist on Wulfing’s, the only genuine Formamint,
as its great success has produced many worthless
imitations.

Lord Glantawe writes: “I have been using
Wulfing’s Formamint for Sore Throat with most
satisfactory results.”
General Tillard, C. 8., writes : “ Formamint
has afforded me ready relief when, as is frequently
the case, I have been suffering from Sore Throat.”
Lord Kingsale writes: “ I and my family
use quite a number of Wulfing’s Formamint
Tablets and find them all you say they are.
I always carry a goodly number in my pocket,
and have recommended them to many friends.

The Inky Way.
Dear Bulletin, —My attention lias been
drawn to a paragraph contributed to your
Inky Way (9/7/44) column, which deals
with Labor papers in W.A., and reprints
some misstatements which have been assidu-
ously circulated by some of the minor jour-
nals in this State. Firstly the Westralian
Laborites have not yet expressed an inten-
tion of starting a daily newspaper on
£15.000. A company is being promoted for
that purpose with a capital of £50,000, and
the promoters have stated that they will not
even register the company (not start the
paper) till £15,000 cash is in the bank. The
present position is, I believe, that about
£ 20,000 worth of shares have been applied
for, and about £14,500 cash has been re-
ceived. Now, as to the Worker. Its circu-
lation has been increasing rapidly of late,
and for the last two weeks has been just on
14,000. Of this number less than 5000
copies are purchased by the Goldfields and
other provincial unions on account of their
members, and the balance are disposed of
through the ordinary channels, newsagents,
bookstalls, etc. There is no foundation for
the statement that jobs on the literary stall'
are precarious or underpaid. The permanent
staff includes five members of the Australian
Journalists’ Association, all of whom have
had previous newspaper experience, and the
general rate of pay is higher than that stipu-
lated by the A.J.A. log or that paid by other
offices running similar journals. The posi-
tions are permanent, the directors do not in
any way interfere with the literary staff, and
there is an entire absence 'of “pinpricks.
We send you a copy of the journal for in-
spection. that you may judge whether our
10cS columns and half-dozen illustrations
would not command a sale at a penny on
merits. It may also be of interest that our
paid up capital is only £ 3OOO . but under the
control of our directors, “without any
special Qualification,” a reserve fund of
nearly £750 has been accumulated out of
profits. The genesis of the complaint is not
really Hint the Worker is doing badly, but
that it is doing too well to be pleasant to
envious persons.—Yours, etc., Arthur
Levetus, General Manager.
Buried at the age of 74, Hermann Wil-
helm I’uttman, Melbourne’s most ancient
printer, or thereabouts. After some years
in Tasmania lie crossed to Melbourne, and
joined Fergusson and Moore, a well-known
printing firm. In 1872 he became one of
the partners in McCarron, Bird and Co., and
was still in that business at his death 42
years later. Away from type be did a good
deal of literary work, was secretary of the
Deutscher Turn Verein, one of the founders
of the German Club, and for a time presi-
dent of the Master Printers.
“Melb ” : Florrie Finn gives chatty lec-
tures in our suburbs on her Grand Tour of
England, Egypt, - etc., illustrated with photos
of her own taking; and the little entertain-
ment is much appreciated. I do not, off-
hand, remember another woman taking this
line, essayed by so many men, though Miss
Finkelstein and Miss Hughes have lectured
us on their visits to Jerusalem. Miss Finn
is granddaughter of Edmund Finn, author
of “Garryowen’s” extremely minute
“Chronicles of Melbourne,” in two big ( vol-
umes of small print. When Governor Stan-
ley recently declared Northcote a city the
Mayor presented him with a copy, and Stan-
ley said he really could not receive anything
more valuable for his office. The son of
“Garryowen,” Edmund 11., father of Flo-
rence, is a well-known litterateur and dra-
matic critic; and bis brother, I'at, is some-
what noted in that line both in Sydney and
Melbourne. Edmund 11. competed worthily
with Marcus Clarke, Akhurst and Garnet
Walch in supplying the Melbourne stage
with Christmas pantomimes, works of art
in their way, carefully rhymed, well localised
and infinitely superior to the maudlin im-
ported trash of Hickory Wood and the like.
I want Dyson to get to this work. And

“Curlew”: Tassy is now the only State
that ambles along without a Hansard to
preserve the weighty utterances of its
mighty statesmen. For years South Aus-
tralia put thousands into the pockets of the
Conservative newspaper proprietors, who
printed pages of dry-as-dust speeches, then
lifted the type and published the matter in
book-form. But the Flyspeek State does not
work on such an elaborate scale. It merely
subsidises the Fusion organ, which gives a
more or less full account of the proceedings,
then clins the reports and pastes them in a
book. Tasmanians never seem to worry
about the pearls of wisdom that must be
lost under this system. Neither do I. The
new S.A. Hansard staff began its work last
week, and the Register and Advertiser will
suffer an annual loss of £lOOO or so each.
This verbatim reporting of Parliament had
an evil influence over all journalistic work
in that State, with the result that journalism
there has been the dullest in the Common-
wealth for long past. The staffs strive after
length, and merit is accredited by the foot-
rule. It’s a fool of a system that does that.
“0.C.C.”: Heaven forbid that I should
hurt anybody’s feelings, but — Well. In
the dear, old S. M. Hekald the other day
there appeared an example, or instance —if
it wasn’t a symptom or portent —of blithering
asininity. A Yankee parson, who had never
even seen Australia before, landed off the
Yank mailboat, and (of course) Granny
and Auntie, not forgetting the other “great
dailies,” sent along their young men to sit
at the feet and hymn-book of our visit- r.
It must have been Grandma’s young mar
who asked the question, because this is hov
it appeared in her hallowed columns
I can say nothing about Australia yet. I have not
been here long enough.
The inference is that the old lady's young
man actually asked the lamentable question,
“How do you like (or, What do you think
of) Australia?” It reminds me of the first
time I ever realised the sublime uselessness
(in the circs.) of such a quesion. In 1880
the late J. Chamberlain went to the United
States as Fisheries Commissioner. When
the old Cunarder arrived off Sandy Hook it
was met by the usual tug, conveying about
30 myrmidons of the New York press, who
badly wanted to “intervoo” the redoubtable
Britisher. They went aboard, were “inter-
dooced” and waved ,to seats. Then (of
course) the fatuousest reporter of the lot
put the absurd old N’York question, “Well,
Mr. Chamberlain, and how do you like our
city?” Joseph screwed in his eyeglass:
“One moment, gentlemen. Before 1 answer
that question let me ask you one.” Cer-
tainly.” “Yep.” “Go right ahead, sir,”
etc., etc. “What” (winningly) “do you
think of Birmingham?” Significant silence;
then one chump burst out. “Say, Mr. Cham-
berlain ; we never saw Birmingham! \\ e
don’t know a thing about it.” “Exactly,
my dear sir; nor I of New Yorl;! The
pressmen took it in good part, though not
to know all about New York before you’d
even left the steamer was —in those days—
a horrible admission of ignorance. After
that the New York reporters got out of
the way of asking distinguished strangers
that question until they (the strangers) had
been in the City of Gotham for quite three
days.
* * * *
“J.F.H.”: A London literary agency
announces its readiness to supply plots of
amorous, humorous and sensational short-
stories at 2s. each. This is fairly cheap raw
material for manufacturers, provided the
stuff is really capable of being worked up
into readable matter. The scheme is cer-
tainly quite feasible; thus, in the literary
partnership of Besant and Rice which pro-
duced “Ready Money Mortiboy” and a bushel
of other first-class novels, Rice furnished
the plots and Besant did most of the writing.
At this new London literary bureau a norm
will also procure you “jokes suitable for
illustration,” also “scenarios and synopses of
plays” and “notes for speeches, sermons and
addresses on any subject.” But a florin for
the mere “notes” for a sermon won t do.
There are other agencies in London ready to
sell not merely notes but complete sermons
for a bob aoiece. These are the old stock
of red-nosed, unfrocked parsons, who aie
plentiful in Babylon-beside-the-Thames.
A LITANY FOR SOME WHO BADLY NEED ONE!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A correspondent recently suggested that there
should be prayer in the churches for journalists,
who, he said, were the most difficult class to reach
religiously. The Devil, the flesh and Mammon are
unceasing in their desperate efforts to sieze and ex-
ploit this coveted influence. 1 have asked _ if any
reader knew of a diocesan litany which included
prayers for the Press, but 1 have not heard of one.
I hope the time will soon come when every diocesan
litany will include a prayer for editors, authors and
journalists.— News item.
General Prayer.
Lord, in deep anguish and distress,
We kneel and ask Thee now to bless
The stubborn, wilful, wicked Press!
We beseech Thee to hear us!
Of all the miserable sinners
Who love strong liquors and good dinners,
None are so vile as these word-spinners—
Have mercy upon these miserable writers!
Prayers for Editors.
Give ear, O Lord, to this our earnest prayer
For Editors —the good ones are most rare ;
The other sort don’t either know or care—
Good Lord, enlighten them !
Harsh, proud, unfeeling—off home at eleven ;
With hearts set on all things, save those of Heaven;
Heedless of wrongs to “Justice” and “Mother of
Seven” —
Good Lord, still pity them !
Remember not their offences or their capers
In “forwarding” the weird “policies” of their papers ;
The fault lies with the importers! and big drapers—
Have mercy upon Editors!
Prayer for Leader-Writers.
For these invisible men, censorious—
Full of quotations and vain-glorious—•
We ask Thine aid; make them victorious
Over Infinitives split, uproarious!
Save all leader-writers, we pray Thee!
Prayer for Sub-Editors.
Ilowe’er so deeply sunk in Sin —-
Howe’er so near Thy Wrath —-
Still let the blessed work begin,
Nor sweep these from the Path !
How black their misdeeds none may say;
Though, Thou Lord, knowest well;
Yet, for sub-editors we pray
To save their souls from Hell !
Spare even sub-editors, O Lord!
Prayer for Reporters.
Note. — 7/ any be still hostile or hot-minded among
the Brethren, for that a Reporter hath injured
or slighted him {as he thinketh), it is incum-
bent upon him to refrain from uttering the
responses herein. But if he do fully and freely
forgive any that hath slighted, spurned or
cruelly condemned trim (as he thinketh), he
shall join heartily in the responses.
Hardened and unregenerate—deaf and blind;
To mirth much given; to roystefing inclined;
Oft late at duties in Thy House “assigned”—
Yet. have mercy upon Reporters, 0 Lord!
But blow upon them with Thy chastening wind,
For wayward lambs are 'these,' who do not mind
Long vigils in vile service; who, unkind,
Write not the blessing and the joy they find
Among Thy servants, Lord, meek and resigned—
Spare—after due chastisement —the Reporters, O
Lord !
i’ltavmt for Sporting and Other Department
Reporters.
Look, O Lord, with deep compassion
On all who draw a daily ration
From Horse or Mammon, Stoush or Fashion—
We beseech Thee to convert them, 0 Lord!
Prayer for the Religious Editor.
Not to appeal, 0, Lord, so much as praise,
Do we uplift our voice upon this phase ;
For lo! as was the One Just Man in Sodom,
In the inky mirth appeareth Brother Goddom!
Graciously look upon the Reliyious Editor, 0 Lord!
0 Lord, arise, help us; and incline his heart to
print us more!
Prayer for Newspaper Proprietors.
0 !

ning, and the Litany closed with a bang.]

You will have no Transformer troubles if you instal

satisfactory service. The wrought-iron corrugated case
is of great strength, as is also the iron core, the rigidity
of which prevents humming.
The OIL EXPANSION CHAMBER keeps the hot oil
from contact with the atmosphere, and effectively
prevents the formation of sludge and water in the oil.
As these Transformers may be despatched full of oil,
there is no troublesome drying-out process. Let us send
you full particulars and illustrations.

Confidences
Concerning
the Modern
Blarney Stone
The ancient Blarney Stone is known to
practically everybody. As it is situated near
the top of Blarney Castle an acrobatic feat
was necessary to reach it.
In recent years, however, a little alteration
has been made to the building, and now
visitors can kiss the Blarney Stone quite
easily.
But the modern Blarney Stone is not a stone
at all, and you never have to imperil your
neck to kiss it.
It is a cylinder that fits any Edison Phonograph, and upon it you can record your
voice in the quiet of your home just as easily as you speak into the telephone.
Then, by a simple adjustment, ■ the phonograph will repeat to you what you have
spoken or sung into it.
Thus you have an opportunity "to study your own voice and manner of speech,
correct the faults you discover and ultimately acquire the gift of tongue, which
according to the old Irish legend can be achieved by kissing the Blarney Stone.
The Edison
Home Recording Outfit
We have prepared a moderately-priced Home Recording Equipment, which con-
sists of a four-minute Recorder, three blank Record Cylinders, and a- Shaving
Machine —the latter to shave the records so that they can be used over and over
again.
The entire outfit costs but £2. The Recorder alone costs 15/-, the Shaving
Machine .cl/5/-, the blank Record Cylinders 1/- each.
If your phonograph is equipped with a Reproducer Arm to hold Model “O” and
Diamond Reproducers, it is necessary for us* to supply an Adapter Ring, which
is 2/6 extra.
For hire Concert or Amberola Phonographs, which have stationary Reproducer
Arms, it is necessary to supply a special Recorder Arm and a Recording Horn.
The Recorder Arm is 6/- extra, and the Recording Horn costs —/O.
The complete Recording Outfit, or any desired part thereof, can be obtained
from any wide-awake Edison dealer. If yotu- dealer does not handle this equip-
ment, please write us direct.

“0.K.”: In his “Pygmalion” play Bernard
Shaw is much more of an unreasonable re-
publican than a caustic philosopher. His
heroine is a matured cockney flower-girl, of
degraded parentage, whom an eccentric mil-
lionaire trains in the airs and graces of
super-polite society. She is presented as
a soft-spoken and elegantly-mannered young
woman after a. year’s tuition. But she re-
mains true to her old vulgarities of diction,
and she startles a company of “upper middle
class” admirers by saying “Not blanky
likely” or “No blanky fear” in the dulcet
tones of a delicately nurtured duchess. This
is an absurd assertion of democratic doc-
trine. Shaw apparently would suggest that
because the same human nature is common
to all grades of womanhood, and refinement
is no-t born but made, therefore a gutter-
bred girl can be taken in her teens and
taught refinement of accent. But the edu-
cation of speaking tones begins in infancy.
It is a matter of environment rather than
precept. A good “choice” of language can
he acquired by any intelligent, self-educated
woman up to the age of 40, but her tones of
utterance can be improved only a little after
her speaking voice is formed. You can
make a graceful, stylish, well-mannered
woman out of a 17-year-old vulgarienne, but
you can’t make her speak like, say, the late
Queen Victoria, any more than you can teach
,a brainy youth from a factory to talk
exactly like the empty-headed son of a
hundred earls. , Tuition in accent comes to
a child through the ear, and it comes to
stay. As an aid to the obliteration of class
distinction in a democratic country gentle
speaking should be taught in State schools
for all it is worth.
“J.F.IL”: (from London) : Oswald Stoll,
of the Coliseum, has made few mistakes, but
he probably puts high up in the list his
weakness in permitting Marinetti, the leader
of the Futurists, to produce liis “Grand Con-
cert of Noise Tuners.” There were 23 of
these fearsome instruments, including buz-
zers, exploders, thunderers, whistlers, mur-
murers, gurglers, rattlers, cracklers, roarers
and other ear-splitting inventions. They all
combined to reproduce the “awakening of a
great city” in the morning. The audience’s
idea was that the uproar provided
a pretty fair imitation of a riot
in a menagerie, and it signified its disap-
proval in the usual manner. Music niay
have been all wrong in the past, as the
Futurists assert; but it will take a century
or two of diligent education before the aver-
age music hall-goer will be able to appreciate
the “synthetically-treated noise emotions”
which caused such ructions in the Coliseum.
“Mime”: A cable message mentions that
Miss Gladys Cooper (Mrs. Buckmaster) is
suing “a London weekly paper” for libel, the
journal having alleged that her husband was
going to divorce her. Gladys Cooper is one
of the many theatrical stars who have risen
from the chorus. Seven years ago she was a
lovely but quite obscure inhabitant of the
“Girls of Gottenburg” ballet. Since then
she has played lead in musical comedy,
passed on from that to starring parts in
Wilde and Shaw comedies, and got married.
The weeklies, such as Modern Society, the
London Mail, etc., which specialise in ex-
clusive. information as to what is about to
occur in social and theatrical circles, have
;been having a torrid time of it lately. One
judge termed them a “pest” and another “a
disgrace to British journalism.” They pub-
lish paragraphs such as this: “We hear that
the little lady from Daly’s Theatre again
week-ended at Brighton with the sporting
Marquis. When is her husband going to
object, or is he paid to know nothing?” This
sort of thing thrills the suburbs to the
marrow even when —as is usually the case—
it is meaningless. On the rare occasions
when someone can take it as applying to him-
or herself there is a libel action and rage
and fury everywhere but in legal circles.
“Bobbie”: Courtneidge seems to have
scored a bull’s-eye with his latest production
at the Shaftesbury (London). “The Cinema
Girl” is pretty much of a comic opera, bright
and tuneful, with a strong farcical comedy
| scene for the central episode in the plot.
The Girl is a “star” film actress, and she
1 makes an ungodly show of a Pecksniffian
humbug who has been proclaiming the im-
; morality of picture plays in his addresses to
the Y.M.C.A., and who also happens to be
the father-in-law-elect of her faithless lover.
The actress dupes the pompous purist into
the belief that she is a Russian princess
violently enamored of him. She makes an
appointment; he proceeds to offer her his
! endearments, and then he discovers that they
I have been photographed all the time for
moving-picture purposes. The fooling of a
fatuous admirer by a pretty Delilah is a
familiar subject for farcical comedy, but the
trick of the Cinema Girl gives it a new and
up-to-date interest. The result is as com-
pletely successful as the second act of “The
Arcadians.” where the conventional melo-
drama scene of the horserace is presented
under novel conditions.
“Melb”: Weathersby, producer here of
“The Yeoman of the Guard,” has a letter
from Gilbert explaining its genesis. This
piece was so different from former Savoyans
that Gilbert and Sullivan were anxious about
it; but they felt they must develop a fresh
vein. Gilbert got the first idea of “The Yeo-
man” from a placard of the Tower Furnish-
ing Co., with a Beefeater on it. This sug-
gested the Tower and Beefeaters. Yet for a
while the author did not get beyond the
notion of a modern piece, with eccentrics of
the day in the Tower and a Beefeater
chorus. These were to be young ladies,
guardsmen and so forth. Then he bought a
magazine, in which the picture of a jester
struck him, suggesting Jack Point. Further
thinking made him put the time back to the
16th century. His first title was “The Beef-
eaters.” Sullivan advised “Yeoman of the
Guard,” although the yeomen have no pro-
per relation to the Tower. Gilbert thought
it their best piece of work, taking one with
the other, and Sullivan agreed.
“Monkbarns”: Beerbolim Tree assumed
the tiny part of Gaffer Pottle in “The Silver
King.” before King George, with stars
shining all round him. It reminds me of
Ellen Terry once taking the part of a ser-
vant girl, whose only job was to fetch in a
letter. This was at a fashionable charitable
amateur show, held at the zenith of her
DOING A LOT FOR ART.

reign. Hoskins was the original Gaffer
Pottle in Melbourne, but he was afterwards
transferred to Jailces. The original Mel-
bourne cast included : Denver, Titheradge ;
Spider, Garner; Jaikes, Day; Coomb, Red-
wood ; Cripps, Leake; Ware, Cates; Detec-
tive, Stirling Whyte; the three Cronies, E.
Marshall, Seftou and Daniels ; Mister ’Enery
Corker, Phillips; Nellie Denver, Annie
Mayer; Olive Skinner, Blanche Stammers.
With that cast I would challenge any other,
even the first in London. Other Silver Kings
have included Wilson Barrett, W. J. Hollo-
way, Knight, Inglis, Hedley and Bentley.
I think Knight ran Titheradge close, but
still left him supreme. He towered over
Barrett in the first act, where Barrett’s
Denver was one of the most insignificant
things I have seen from a leading man!
At latest advices from N’York, Margaret
Anglin was scoring heavily as Mrs. Erlynne
in a revival of “Lady Windermere’s Fan.”
Katherine Grey, stepping down a place, was
playing a mere wife-with-three husbands in
a roaring farce, “The Rule of Three.”
The Hum That Failed.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O, mister, I’ve got no time for them
I city blokes after the way me and
me mate Scotty was treated dirty by
one of ’em in co’lition with an ole cove about
’ere wot we thought was a friend of ours up
to then.
“It was like this: Me an’ Scotty had done
in our chippin’ cheques an’ a bit over at this
’ere pub, and the boss had hinted pretty
plain, though not too perlite, that our slates
was full an’ our swags gettin’ fat for want
of exercise. He guv us an eye-opener w’en
he opened the bar that mornin’, but w'en we
put it on ’iin for another he got personal and
said things wot wouldn’t be took from no-
body but a publican w’en a feller’s stiff.
“Well, about nine o’clock me an’ Scotty
was sittin’ on this same form feelin’ p’ticular
bad —nearly as bad as we do now, Mister —
w’en a toffy-lookin' ten traveller or somethin’,
wot had treated us with spurm w’en we put
the acid on ’im, came on to tli’ verandah to
meet the cockies who were coming in for
their sugar money. Me an Scotty said
‘good-day,’ affable-like, to the cockies, an’
never sed ‘Bill’ or ‘Jim’ or such to them we
used to work with before they was cockies.
An’ we called the clarsy ones ‘mister’ and
‘sir.’ But our amiableness didn’t do no good.
Did y’ ever notice ’ow dry talkin’ makes a
feller, Mister?
“Anyhow, then up comes our quandong
friend wot I mentioned before, ole Joe Lovett.
W’en we saw ’im we knoo we was all right,
’cos Joe ’adn’t been in for months, an’ was
free with his money. We sits up an’ nods
to Joe careless-like, an’ he ses ‘Mornin,’ Jim;
inornin’, Scotty. Come an’ ’ave a’——
“We was standing up by this time.
“ ‘Game of quoits for three pots.’
“We knoo he was too good for us an’ was
just sittin’ down agen very dejected-like w’en
he ses, ‘Well, then, come in an’ ’ave a’-
“Me an’ Scotty was half-way to the bar
w’en that rag-sellin’ tailor’s dummy from
Bundy chips in with ‘l’ll give you a toss-up,
ole chap.’
“Ole Joe was very ondecided, air me an’
Scotty was jerkin’ our ’eads towards the bar
like ’ell, but he goes off with the swell, him
not thinkin’ like you, Mister, that a pot does
a man good after a booze up.
“Well, an idea gets a.hblt on me an' I
ses: ‘Come on,. Scotty. We’ll run the game
for ’em, so’s one of ’em must blow, off.’ I
appoints Scotty ref’ree and me judge, an’
we acted in them capacities, at the same
time criticisin’ the play an’ callin’ out, ‘Good
quoit, sir !’ an’ ‘Well thrown, Joe !’ an’ ceterer;
ah’ measurin’ distances with a strip of cane
rind till the end, w’en ole Joe won. Me an'
Scotty was jub’lant an’ led the percession
t’wards the bar. There we turned an’ were
s’prised to see Joe on’y half-way an’ the
goggle-eyed bloke holdin’ the quoits in his
’ands an’ sayin, ‘Let’s ’ave another game.’
The ole feller looked at the bar kinder linger-
in’, an’ wiped his lips with his tongue, so I
knoo he was hoggin’ for a pot same as me
an’ Scotty are now, but he went back; Me
an’ Scotty never sed nothin’—just resoomed
our onerous juties silent-like, but I looked at
’im and he looked at me.
“The second game the stranger won, an’
as it was up to Joe to shout the judge and
ref’ree guv their verdic’ accordin’. We was
breastin’ the barrier before the last quoit:
stopped rollin’, w’en we heard that blessed;
how-to-keep-thin advertisement sayin’, plaus-:
ible like : “Exc’lent, exc’lent! Game all! |
Let’s have the cornkrer!’ I admit, Mister,,
that ole man Lovett tried manfully to resist
an’ get the cove to put his chest against the
mehog’ny, but; eventchally he let hisself be
persuaded agenst his good resolutions an’
resoomed playin’, not thinkin’ of us two wot
'ad been doin’ all the work and barrackin'
an’ gettin’ wobbly at the knees an’ specks
before the eyes, ’cos too much talkin’ on a
dry throat is bad for fellers after a spree.
Ain’t it. Mister?
“Anyhow, bad as we was—and are —we
never sed nothin’ out loud, but I looked at
Scotty, an’ Scotty looked at me, as we took
up our positions agen, consolin’ ourselves by
thinkin’ that this game would settle it an’
that w’en Joe had got outside of the first pot
there’d be plenty for a few days.
“T.’ resoom —in the third game, ’leven up.
they was nine all an’ the excitement intense
the judge and ref’ree losin’ their blocks an’
barrackin’ for all thev was worth, though
feelin’ cruel weak through want of a pint
and husky in the throat from talkin’. You
might notice them kinder symptoms on me
now. Mister. At any rate, the stranger won
an’ we slung up our ’ats, ’cos Joe wouldn’t;
leave his ole mates out w’en he blew. Well
while the winner was offerin’ Joe his condo-
lations for losin’, he says: ‘Will y’ join me
in a glass of somethin’, an’ Joe sed he didn’t
mind if he did, an’ Scotty an’ me sed we
didn’t mind too. So we adjourns to the bar.
me an’ Scotty praisin’ up the play, w’en the
winner looks straight through my head an’
ses to Joe: “Wot’s yours, Mr. —. I
haven’t the pleasure of your name. ‘’Ere’s
my card,’ Joe ses. ‘Mine’s a pint, no frorth.
I’m Joe Lovett.’ Then the city cove calls for
a sherry and bitters, an’ you may throw me
down a cliff if the treacle-haired son of a
Scotch Jew didn’t plank down a bob, an’
me an’ Scotty in the comnanv, so to speak,
an’ bavin’ done all the judgin’ an’ refereein’.
an’ sufferin’ terrible in the inside for reasons
I’ve told you about. Now. Mister, wot do
you think of fellers that’ll let a feller graft
and talk like that for ’em an’ then forget
he’s got a neck to be wetted? I ses it show?
their ign’rance. but a gent, like you wot’s
been about a bit wouldn’t turn a cove wot’s
sufferin’ a recovery down that way. would
yer now?
“Well, w’en we seen the bob on the counter
me an’ Scottv never said nothin’, but 'I
looked through the door an’ Scotty looked
through the winder. No. we never spoke
till we hit Currajong Creek, where we both
looked up for the first time an’ sed simul-
tanvus: ‘Well, I’m damned.’
“Did I mention. Mister, that me an’
Sco+ty have done in our cheques again, an’,
as I might have let slip while talkin’, we are
feelin’ real particular crook just now for
want of a couple of P" fs . me throat bein’

From London: Old Australian playgoers
will remember George Fawcett Rowe, who
ran the Princess’s Theatre (Melb.) for some
years. His name now rarely appears in
print, but it has been figuring of late in the
papers here in connection with a new version
of “David Copperfield,” by L. N. Parker,
which Beerbolim Tree is about to put on at
His Majesty’s. G. F. Rowe is recalled as
“the finest and most realistic impersonator
of Mr. Micawber on record,” and the theatri-
cal gossips are wondering whether Tree’s
Micawber will equal it. Parker is making a
fresh dramatisation of the novel, and has
taken some liberties with Dickens. Micaw-
ber was sent off to Australia by Dick-
ens, who left him there; but Parker brings
the story to an end with the return of the
old drifter, prosperous and benevolent, and
eager to pronounce a blessing upon the union
of Agnes and David.

WHAT DYSPEPTICS SHOULD KNOW.
PHYSICIAN’S TIMELY ADVICE.
The fact that few dyspeptics ideally under-
stand the cause of their trouble is probably
the reason why drugs are still used to such
an alarming extent. The practice is wrong,
however, and is strongly condemned by many
physicians.
The presence of excess acid in the stomach
is the cause of practically all forms of
digestive trouble, and this can be neutralised
and rendered harmless by the occasional use
of ordinary bisurated magnesia—a product
which can be obtained of any chemist.
Physicians use bisurated magnesia them-
selves as well as recommend it to their
patients, because they recognise that it not
only overcomes dangerous stomach acid and
thus ensures easy digestion, but by its use
no harmful drug is introduced into the system,
and therefore there can be no unpleasant
after-effects. Half a teaspoonful taken in a
little water after meals is usually quite
sufficient to keep the food contents of the
stomach free from fermentation and acid,
thus ensuring normal digestion.*
What is the Best Beauty Soap
for the Complexion ?
There is at present a great controversy
going on in the English newspapers about
the best soap to use for the complexion.
Some advocate the use of one and some
another kind, but they are all satisfied on
one or tw y o points, and those are that for a
soap to be beneficial to the skin, must be
one without coloi'ing matter, and witlmut a
lot of strong, coarse, irritating perfume being
added, and also that the soap must be made
from good ingredients without a preponder-
ance of soda, which makes the skin hard.
An English soapmaker has been able to
combine all the above good qualities in a
soap, and* at the same time to incorporate
some of the puritol wax, which is so much
in demand as a complexion beautifier and
protective, so that on washing with Puritol
Wax Soap there is a trace of the wax left
on the skin, which, by its continuous sooth-
ing and corrective action on the skin and
its pores, keeps - itr in a healthy and pure
state, and orevents the formation of pimples
and blemishes on it.

IRVINE COOK (to the kid without a vote):
“YOU'RE defending our country and you’ll
jolly well have to pay for it—same as you
ought to pay for everything the.”
The nebulous Willie Kelly recently charged
Frank Tudor with having, while Minister
for Customs, allowed the Beef Trust to start
operations in Australia, lie based this accu-
sation on the fact that Tudor, as Minister
for Customs, approved of the plans of the
Swifts’ building on the Brisbane River. So,
• according to this. Mr. W. 11. Kelly, Minister
in the Cook Cabinet, is well aware that the
Swifts are identical with the Beef Trust.
If this is so, why did Cook appoint a Com-
mission to discover if the J-iust is in Aus-
tralia? „ . . „ , ,

Prime Minister Cook appeals to the people
of Australia to judge him on what lie says.
Well, not very long ago Mr. Cook derided
the “tinpot” Australian fleet and jumped
on the idea of compulsory military training.
Let us judge him. And after judgment—
what happens?

The Sydney Evening News mentioned
last Friday that, when Britain is mixed up in
a European war, Japan, as Bull’s ally, will
probably take on the job of “guardian of
the Commonwealth.” It is a pleasing pros-
pect. but a riscal-sinking country which pre-
fers to import goods and debts and Eight-
hours procession banners rather than men
is bound, sooner or later, to have some
strenuous colored person come along as its
guardian. The Babes in the Wood had their

A POLITICIAN'S GHOST .
THE KID AUSTRALIA: “Gant, es trying to
kid me that foe's doin' that talking."
[Devised and drawn by OSWALD PRVOU, Moonta
mines, South Australia.]
Said the Sydney Telegraph a very few
days ago : —• *'
'there lias , even been a suggestion that the London
Stock .Exchange should close, which is unthinkable.
And promptly the unthinkable happened.
Even John Bull is mortal.
Justice Bring, of N. S. Wales, made an
absurd mistake during the Boorabil pro-
ceedings last week, when he asked Premier
llolman if he had kept the minutes taken by
him of a certain Cabinet meeting, and if
not why not, or wolds to that effect. Under
the British Governmental system, which
Australia has imported, a Cabinet that was
convicted of taking minutes of its delibera-
tions would be hanged—or at any rate,
something serious would happen to it.
Leonard Courtney lays this down very firmly
in “The Working Constitution of the U.K.
and its Outgrowths.” Also Gladstone said
once, in that er cathedra manner of which
lie was such an admitted master, “No one
may take set-notes during Cabinet proceed-
ings. Even the Prime Minister must rely
on memoranda jotted down on a scrap of
paper for the material on which to make his
report to the Sovereign.” In Australia, of
course, the convention of reporting the pro-
ceedings in Cabinet does not exist. Before
George I.’s day the Sovereign used to attend
Cabinet meetings. George abandoned the
practice, as he couldn’t understand his Min-
isters’ language, and had more interesting
things to do ariyhow. Which was how the
reporting custom originated in England.
FSigned: Hans Tlempirb, 8 Lager-strasse, Sydney.]
A Tic. viewpoint:—
The result of the Essenclon (Vic.) State by-elec-
tion should give Willie Watt the cold shivers, if rot
the horrors. The Liberal was well known and popu-
lar in the district, the Laborite a comparative stran-
ger, yet the latter turned Watt’s 1400 majority of
his last election into a Liberal deficit of 1000 votes.
But the Liberal had been assisted by several Mini-
sters and selected and helped by Watt himself —and
apparently the electors had little use for Watt's
nominee. The alleged “great sacrifice” didn't gull
them, any more than it does the Balaclava Liberals.
At the yery hour of Labor's victory Carty Salmon,
in St. Kikla Town Hall, was announcing his retire-
ment from the Balaclava contest before the pushful
insistence of William Watt and the A.W.N.C. That
Salmon was foolish is undoubted. Possibly lie lacked
stomach for a fight; but with pluck and energy the
scat .was his for the taking. Now it is more than
possible it will go to Labor. When he told how,
after canvassing the electorate for months, he was
pushed out by the A.W.N.L. because of his connec-
tion with the “old Deakin party,” the meeting
groaned, and when he finally announced his with-
drawal one listener blurted out, “This underhand
business is no good to me. I will not vote for
Watt; I shall vote for Labor,” and was cordially
( cheered. Which looks by no means healthy for
Watt.
[F. C. .Tones, Elgar-road, Burwood, Victoria.]
C. A. Jeffries (214 George-street, Sydney) :
Joe Cook, speaking at Bathurst (vide
S. M. Herald, 23/7/’l4), stated that
Fisher had deliberately misrepresented him
when he (Fisher) said the Liberals in-
tended to borrow for Defence purposes—
they had never thought of such a thing. I
do not know whether the Fusion crowd did
think of borrowing for Defence purposes.
But I do know that Cook himself, when
addressing the Farmers’ Conference at
Maryborough (Vic.) said: “The man is
mad who proposes to pay for Defence out of
revenue.”
The cat that goes too often to the well
is drowned at last. Something like live
years ago Germany warned Russia not to
interfere with Austria’s annexation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, and Russia, being crippled
by the unlucky Jap disturbance, backed down
with curses. It may not have pro-
posed to interfere, but the warning that it
was to play the Scriptural part of Rahab-
sit-still hurt its pride. The other day it
received an ultimatum from the same source
that it must not interfere on behalf of its
fellow-Slav in Servia. Then Rahab-sit-still
grew utterly wild, and refused to be dictated
to. and the party who sent the ultimatum
had to declare war or lose all his dignity.
So the Russo-German trouble started.
Canada threatens to rlo a burst of cheap
“loyalty” by sending 30,000 ill-trained men
to help the Ma Country in the embittered
hour of scrap. If, by any chance, Germans
or others were to attack Canada while these
scrappers were away the Yankees —between
ninety and a hundred millions of them—
would have to defend the country in pur-
suance of their policy of preventing any
European race getting a new foothold on the
American continent. So Canada can afford
to do a dash. The offer was reported in the
Maoriland Legislature, and that wild and
foolish Jingo conglomeration shouted “Well
done, Canada!” and sang “God save.” But
Maoriland has no ninety or a hundred million
white citizens just across a long land border
to depend upon in time of need, so it had
better not burst out in emulation of Canada.
Joseph Ward, of course, heaped himself on
his feet, and talked of sending troops for the
defence of the Empire. But unfortunately
Wellington is likely to be in much more
danger than London. Still Ward can get
a,way from Wellington, while poorer citizens
can’t. And Ward’s possible peerage is wait-
ing in London—not in Wellington.
THE INCORRIGIBLE BELLES.

LONG-SUFFERING CIT. : “Hooray!”
[Devised and drawn by EDWARD COLLES, Belgrave-
street, Manly, N.S.W.]
The war trouble in Europe lias made
things very cold and bitter for the Austra-
lian candidate. Pages and pages of news-
paper space which he expected to get have
been filled with military intelligence. On a
scanty and miserable back sheet it is men-
tioned that Mr. Jones addressed the elec-
tors, or that Mr. Smith also ran, or that
Air. Brown fell at the first hurdle, or that
Mr. Robinson was left at the post, or that
Mr. Blenkiusop sprung a leak and sank, or
that the Liberal or Labor League nominated
Mr. Podsnap, but the marine insurance com-
panies refused to take the risk at less than
20 guineas per cent, for fear of capture by
bushrangers in the Red Sea.

LAW AND ORDER.
[?] episode in the life of James Dooley, of Dublin.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Imsii Timks, the Dublin Unionist paper,
suggests that the Nationalist and Ulster volunteers
should co-operate to preserve the public peace.
—Cable item.
Now here’s a line suggestion
To settle all the question;
A proof to every Irishman that merricles don't cease ;
For wid our right arms swingin’,
And wid our lift arms dingin’,
Man an’ boy we’ll all of us preserve the pubic
peace.
I met wid Dan Macfarhin;
Oclione, but Dari’s a darlin’ ;
’Tis Dan of all me Ulster frinds is just the frind 1
want.
“Danny,” sen I, “me beauty,
’Tis me an’ you for duty,
Upholdin’ law an' order in the fields a bit bevant.”
Now what a boy is Danny!
Cold fear? lie hasn’t anny ;
lie stripped his coat and came wid me to Murtagh
Ryan's door.
Wid sponge an’ tow’l an’ water
Did Ryan watch the slaughter,
While Dan an’ me uphild the peace a solid hour an’
more.
“Begad,” sez Daniel, spittin’
The tooth I had been hittin’,
While I was washin’ down me face and feelin’ for
me cars, j
“1 love ye, Shamus Dooley,
For ye have taught me trooly
Mrtro points in law an’ order than I've felt in forty
years.”
“Me frind,” sez I (still coughin’),
•*v" “I’ve fought wid Curran often,
For him and me was shipmates when lie started in
the game;
But Dan, me. boy, be aisy;
Your lift hook is a daisy ;
It caused me for to keep the peace more times than
I could name.”
“Dan has a jolt,” says Murty,
“A good bit worse than dirty ;
lie brought it underneath ver gyard as often as he
could.
; And James, ye crossed him sweetly,
And uppercut him neatly ;
F’r law-preservin’ citizens ye both was pretty good.”
“ ’Tis felony and arson.”
Sez I, “to shtand wid Carson.”
“,’Tis Hell to pay,” says Daniel, “if Ulsther’s hot
‘set right.” *
“Aw, close yer mouths,” sez Rvan;
“That’s fish for others’ fry in’ ;
Yez two came here to keep the peace ; and now ye’ll
want to fight!”
“Ryan,” sez I, “is right, Dan ;
There’s manny ways to fight, Dan ;
And phwat the Hell is twinty rounds fought fair
’twixt friend an’ friend?
Bruises will heal, that’s sartin ;
But bad words keep on smartin’ ;
Till law an’ order gets a hurt no man on earth can
iner.d.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
"S.T.R.”: Adelaide has always had a
speciollv-kind remembrance of Albert Trott. It- was
on the Oval that he made his meteoric first appear:
a nee in international cricket —January, 1895, when
Blackham and Turner and Lyons and Jarvis were all
finishing their careers, and 'Jones and I redale and
Darling and Howell were starting. Stoddart's XI
had won the two test matches so far played—in
Melbourne by sheer superiority; in Sydney by a
change of weather just as Australia had the game
apparently won. Albert came in for the third test,
and caused a shock. The Englishmen couldn’t get
him out, either innings, and in one of their own
innings couldn’t play his bowling. The finest series
of catches I have ever seen (by Harry, Worrall,
Bruce, Darling, Trott) helped his average. That
he showed inferior form afterwards, and so was not
chosen for the 1896 XI, whereupon he emigrated, is
part of the history of cricket.. My point is that his
brilliant showing in Adelaide led to the historic
fifth test in Melbourne, the only time (in defiance of
•the law of probabilities) that the scores have been
two all when the fifth began.. Also, till the. South
Africans came, Australia never lost a subsequent
match on the Adelaide Oval.
N.S.W. Cricket Association last week
was still climbing the thorny path by kick-
ing at compulsory training,, owing to the in-
roads which the national duty is alleged
to be making on cricket. '"At the annual meet-
ing one W. Bardsley marie- an awful noise over
it. declaring that compulsory ‘ training was the great-
est enemy the Association ha’s, also that it was “an
evil influence.” In spite of -the fact that War Lord
Milieu announced he was prepared to receive a depu-
tation on the subject, the roars of Bardsley and the
s iave platitudes of Milieu are- alike drowned in the
boom of cannon and the shouts of a continental war,
which, before' it is finished, threatens to eclipse
Chalons and Pannipr.t.
Some Australian cyclists in France recently
look part in the Paris-Nancy road race. Nancy is
the place where the French are reported to have
srfiashed up a German detachment at the beginning
of the week, and is 211 miles from Paris. Kirkham,
Munro, Snell and Bell all started. For the first
80 miles (lie pace was slow. ' Munro was the first
to go. His machine started to go to pieces, and
compelled his retirement. Snell and Bell punctured
and were left, Snell finishing 23rd. With 100 miles
to go the pace became swift and wild, and Broc-co
< the winner), Kirkham and J.wo others got away.
The others dropping out, Brocco and Kirkham
settled down to a duel. Right on the finish Kirk-
ham punctured, and Brocco rode borne an
easy winner in 11 hours 23niin. 30sec. Kirk-
ham finished fourth in llhr. 36min. However, Kirk-
ham and Munro were selected _-by the Gladiator Go.,
for whom they ride, to take part in the great Tour-
de-Franee (3340 miles) this week.
H. Haydon put up another splendid per-
formance in the three-mile amateur road-race at
Sydney .on Saturday, by bounding over the dis-
tance in 15min. 34sec. from the scratch mark. This
labor goes on the record-slate as the best extant.
Probably many a burglar with the law in pursuit
ran the distance in less time, but it hasn’t yet been
recorded. W. Sweeting (lmin. 30sec.) took the
cup attached to the event, while Haydon’s fine spin
brought him -into sixth place. Another athletic
effort worth notice was the tussle between W.
McLaren and A. Y\ r . Pickard (both on scratch) in
the three-mile road walk, and Mac. covered himself
with glory by downing the walking champion with
19sec. to spare.
The “John Sands” match supplied the
sparkle in Sydney rifledom on Saturday, the event
Jjeirijfc fired under full service conditions, which in-
eluded 90 minutes walk from Kensington to
Long Bay range, and afterwards plugging
at movable targets, etc. Points were allowed
for marching, shooting and dress. It is to
be regretted that the N.lt.A. did not make
ihe event compulsory to all companies and
rrgiments, when the entrants would have
been quite in keeping with the value of
toe trophy. The result was a win for the
Company with 205 points, from Rand-
vyielc Rifle Club, which put un 203. Parra-
-1 matte hit up 168. Rifle-sliootirig is a game
we are all interested in just now, owing to
vagaries of a man named Bill, who early
this week was said to be in shining armor.
The first day of the inter-State Baseball
carnival at Petersham (Sydney) on Saturday was
a sorry time for visiting teams. S. Ars. and Vie.
each! forwarded rep. and school teams, but only S.
A us.: made a decent showings In the rep match the
(u oweaters put up a hurricane fight with the Ma
State, and only went down by 10 runs to nine—a
well put together tally of s ; x in the last innings
almost pulling the came out of the fire. It was
Ihe only time that the barrackers found something
to howl at—and how they exploded ! In the other-
match, N.S.W. made smell beer of Victoria, and
demolished them by 25 goals to one. The pitching
of IT. Franks nonplussed the Cabbage . gardeners
i hvpfigliont. and their solitary run came through a
clumsy fielding mistake by McClov, of the Ma
State. In the school matches, N.S.W. wiped the
rarth with S. Aus. by six to nil, and chewed Vic.
1 v 15 to nil. Generally the play was too one-sided
10 be cheerful; while the sole sidelight which the
writer found to enthuse over was the neat get-up of
the other Staters by comparison with the various
made trousers or bloomers of the Ma Staters. On
Monday, at Waverlev (Sydney) the carnival made
another step, when South Aus. showed a continuance
of form, and defeated Victoria by eight runs to five,
in a game full of inspiring movements. The
Schools' matches also advanced, with N.S.W. again
on the high altar of victory. Victoria went down
bv. 15 to nine, while South Aus. dropped ’neath the
buttery of the Ma State bv 23 to seven.

The downfall of Norwood, once Adelaide’s
crack football district, is rubbed in by the selectors
of the South Australian “carnival” .team, now in
Svdnev. Formerly Notwood couldn’t go wrong, and
its crickei team still can’t, having been beaten only
twice in the past three seasons. Biit at football it
can’t go right, and South Aus. actually selected 22
for Ihis important trip without a single Norwood
man in the hunch. The unbeaten Ports have seven,
and the other places are well divided up.
The Australian Union Rugby XV was
utterly routed bv the Maorilanders at Brisbane on
Saturday. The weather was-perfect, and as a result
nearly 13,000 people rolled up to hear Freedom
shriek at their country’s downfall. Three times in
the first half the Maoriland back machine ran right
vhiough the Australian defence, but, lortunatelj,
these Maorilanders are no lackers and, not oue of
the three tries was converted. Ihe All Blacks
arrived at half-time with nine to ml. .Australia had
the wind behind it during- the second halt, but it
made no difference. Maoriland went on scoring, and
this time it did manage to convert a try, and won
dead easily bv 17 to nil.
At Auckland on Saturday tlie English
XI]V ran with its mouth open at a representative
Maoriland team, arid after a wild and strenuous
time crawled to the top of the heap with 1C points
to 13. The English were the dominating, high con-
tending party from the jump, and rattled up eight
points to nil before Maoriland broke: its egg, and
(hen an unconverted try gave it three. At half-time
England was 11 to three. During the second half
England put in most of the time strenuously defend-
ing, but the Maoriland attacks were all but one
repulsed, and one counter-attack got 'riglit home.
Ho England won as before mentioned.
When the sun climbed out of the ocean
last Saturday morning South Sydney held a pre-
carious position at the top of the Rugby League poll
with 17 points to the 16 of Newtown, and it had to
meet Eastern Suburbs, the premier team. Its row
was a hard one. But when the sun fell with y splash
into the slush beyond Pyrmont the uncertain and
always dangerous Balmain team had smashed up
Newtown bv 10 to eight, and South had trodden on
Eastern Suburbs by 10 to five, and Sopth had got a
clear margin of three in the competition race, with
19 points'to Newtown’s 16. Eastern Suburbs lags in
third place with 14, Glebe has 12, Sydney
n. Western Suburbs holds four and Apnandale one.
Eastern Suburbs never had a show with the men
from South Svdney, who, at half-time, led with
seven to nil. Balmain’s victory was as unexpected
as it was destructive. At half-time t Newtown led
with five to two, and the two was secured only on
the moment by a lucky kick. Close up to time the
score was -five all, and then a burst of excitement
took place, and the whistle blew with Balmain leading
by two. The struggles between North Svdney and
Western Suburbs and Glebe and Annandale had no
bearing on the campaign. North won an uninterest-
ing game with 13 to three, and Glebe outer! Annan-
dale by 27 to nine.
In the Union division Glebe is fit the top
of the tree with 22 competition points.to the 20 of
South Sydney, the 17 of Eastern Suburb?, and the 14
of University. In the B division. Western Suburbs
tops the list with 15, St. George has 18, and so has
North Sydney, and the baby team, Haridwick, has
12. Below that are three with single figures. Glebe
overthrew University by 16 to 12 after a strenuous
struggle which was anybody’s game right up till
time. Randwick gave Manl.v an awful astonishment,
jumping on it to the tune of 29 to five. South Syd-
ney smashed Eastern Suburbs bv 17 to 11 ; St.
George heaped infamy on Balmain by 20 to nine:
and Western Suburbs dog-walloped Newtown hv 33
to three.
Not within the memory of the baldest
bun-acker has Vie. hoofball seen a season to equal
this —gorgeous “gates,” glorious weather, .throughout
and interest kept at boiling point to the finish. On
Saturday two more League teams were passed out —
’Don and St. Hilda —though not quite beyond hope
of salvation. Yet, with but two game's to play to
finish the round, only Carlton and ’Roy are sure of
places in the “four.” ’Wood, South - and Geelong
dispute claims to the other two “shops” and the
issue will probably only- he settled hi- the last game
of the round, ’Wood r. Geelong. The .c-apsizing of

the ’Dons was accomplished by ’Wood with difficulty
and a small margin, after a game distinguished more
by determination than system or skill. The Magpies
won by pressing home a strenuous attack in the last
quarter. Scores: ’Wood, 48 points; ’Don, 39.
Geelong came up to Carlton and set about handing
the Old Blues a dose like unto the one it gave ’ltoy
the week before, but it found a tougher contract oh
hand, and after a tall struggle it went down by. a
miserable two points—34 to Cai'lton’s 30. The
winners’ kicking was erratic, but they £ot enough
“behinds” to pull through. ’Roy went across to
St. Kilda, eager for victory, but found the locals in
good fettle and grasping their fading hopes with
both feet, so to speak. The largeness of the issue
made the play congested and unbeautiful, but it was
exciting enough. In the third quarter ’Roy piled
on 29 points to St. Kilda’s one, and the.game looked
gone; but the latter gang rose to the occasion,
monopolised the play and raked in 2.3 points to
’Roy’s lonely unit. Still it wasn’t quite enough,
the Maroons still possessing 53 to St. Kilda’s 51.
Had the Saints’ kicking been a shade surer the tale
had been different. South tackled Richmond and won
by 57 points to 43, but neither team played up to
form. South seems to have got the jumps or
hysteritis or something; Richmond is unaccountable
anyhow. Melbourne walloped the Students by 75
to 48, but the episode interested nobody.
Saturday’s game finished the first round
of the Victorian Ass. tourney, and North, ’Scrav,
’Don and ’Town, in that order, will now battle
out the issue. The only scuffles that mattered were
between ’Don and Brunswick (the Brickies lost by
81 points to ’Don’s 100), and between ’Town and
Brighton. ’Town was very gradual in starting and
at lemon-time began to see visions of disaster, but
it bogged in its darndest in the last quarter, piled on
26 points to Brighton’s nil, and so got there by 02
to 39. North kept its leadership by heaping up
130 points to Port’s 63. ’Scray annexed 76 to
R’ran’s 53, and ’Cote went under as usual, to Haw-
thorn this time, by 31 to 92. This latter, the baby
club of the Ass., retires from the contest without
glory but with some credit, having commandeered
three wins and a draw, a vastly better showing than
that of the regrettable Northcote, with one humble,
threadbare and moth-eaten victory. 'Cote ought to
tackle some deliberate recreation like quoits.
During the week tlie Leagues commis-
sioners overhauled Essendon’s captain. He had been
reported for jobbing a spectator who had jumped the
fence in a recent game and handed him (the said
captain) “one to go on with.” The commissioners
dismissed the charge with the remark that the cranky
barracker had only got what he was looking for, and
“it was a pity he hadn’t had to be carried out.
This was doubtless true, but the custom is hardly
one to be encouraged.
Aviator Guillaux had a narrow escape
from death at Ascot Racecourse (Sydney) on Satur-
day, and, incidentally, so had a few score of the
onlookers. He was something over 100 ft. high when
his engine suddenly stopped, and as the presence
of the crowd made anything like volplaning impossi-
ble, without killing a few scores, Guillaux very
bravely dived straight downward with a view tc using
tlie “tail” to check the fall. The distance was too
short to allow the “tail” to get in all its work,
but it got m sufficient to savg the aviator from
sudden death. He was passed into hospital badly
but not dangerously smashed, lie may be a giddy
ox, but he is a cool and daring bild-man.
Even as Zephuron ran away with the
G. N. Steeple at Flemington, so Capintesta bolted
with the Australian Hurdle at Caulfield —only more
so. Hot-headed and light-weighted, the pacemaker
was allowed to do his darndest, and although he
heat no time records he had from 20 to 10 lengths
the best of it for three miles and three furlongs,
lie was soon in front, and. to the horror of punters,
who reckoned that he must pump himself out, the
impetuous animal continued to flee at that distance.
’I lie fact that the consistent old sticker Taurus
(third) was “running on" at the finish argues that
(lie leader’s pace was then losing a little of its early
vigor, but his performance was remarkable all the
same. Of the two heavyweights, Obi did best in
running second. Arquebuse, who lias evidently gone
stale, cut a poor figure in the birdcage and in the
race. In a field of 11 only one horse fill, and tlie
first favorite, llarrawa, happened to be the victim.
Apart from Capintesta’s fine performance the most
striking incident of tlie busy afternoon at Caulfield
was Battleship’s easy victim- in the Steeplechasers’
Mat Race. At Moonee Valiev a week earlier the
Darrawa people were called upon to explain their
gee’s strange reversal of form, so it should have been
up to the V.A.T.C. stewards to call the Battleship
party to account. The son of Flagship, starting at
an outside price, had galloped like a donkey in a
.lumpers’ Mat Race at Moonee Valley a werk ago.
His running was conspicuously bail. On Saturday
he started a warm favorite, and won in commanding
style. Battleship, as tin's scribe suggested last week,
is considered good for a long journey over tlie big
sticks, and unless his form suffers another startling
reversal, he or Coradjil should win the big four
miles Steeplechase on Saturday.
The “books” are so notoriously resourceful in
mispronunciation of horses’ names that Anaclirion,
the 4-year-old ’chaser in the Miller stable, was
bound to get a quaint title in the betting ring. At
Flemington Grand National meeting one fielder was
persistent in his offers to lay against Anna Cryon,
whilst another was yelling the odds about Anak
Ryan. But the punters have their pet absurdities as
well as the “looks.” Peek.o’ Maul: is a trap for
those who incline to culchaw and have a nodding
acquaintance with the French language. Remember-
in'* that faut spells “fo” they inquire the price of
“Peek o’ Mo.”
“Moana”: The tote figures. 051,
mentioned B. 2/7/’l4, as being the product of Auck-
land (M.L.) during the past racing season are the
result of onlv one club's operations—Auckland Rac-
ing Club. There are two other raeirg clubs and
two trotting clubs in the Queen City, and the
whole amount that went through the machine was
J 834.550. M.L. Treasury bagged #20.863 and the
five clubs got £62,590 with which to encourage the
g'ee-gee and the punter.
“The Valkyrie” writes of Fred Storbock,
who is to meet Bill Lang shortly in Sydney:
Frederick is heavyweight champion of South
Africa, an Afrikander, 6ft. tin. in his socks, scales
14st. 81b., and when in his fighting gear on tlie
voyage from Capetown he showed not one ounce of
superfluous flesh. His chest development is almost
abnormal, and though neither his arms or lcgs_ are
unusually large, he should possess “some wallop,” as
the 'Murkans say. He served his time as a black-
smith, but is fast enough on his feet to have prac-
tised as a dancing master. He started as an amateur
in 1909, beating George Rodel on points on
four occasions. He fought Lane Donaldson twice,
winning in the sixth and tenth rounds respectively.
He chased Cunningham off the face of the earth in
the 10th, I-Jartog in the fifth, and Jacobsz in the
third, and having done these deeds he stood forth
the amateur champion of S’Africa. In 1910 he was
in England, where he grabbed the British Amateur
Championship Belt. After a, final amateur campaign
in S’Africa he appeared in London as a professional,
and his first victim was Bill Chase, who was carried
home earlv bv reason of a knockout. In his fight
with Bombardier Wells the referee stopped the scrap
in the 12th, as Storbeck had both eyes closed and
was finite unable to see. He fought Australia’s old
friend, “Nuttv” Curran, three times, and got points
decisions over Jim Johnson and Bob Scanlon. He
tackled Jewev Smith at Wonderland, and the up-
heaval resulted in a 10-round draw. Moran got a
decision against him on a foul, and the spectators
bowled that the decision was unjust. A trip to the
States was brought to nought by a beat wave, and
he went back to South Africa to meet Mike Williams ;
tut falling ill lie went to Rhodesia and led the
simple life killing lions and elephants, and tearing
up crocodiles, and throwing pythons away. On Box-
ing Day. 1913. lie crashed into Mike at the Wan-
derers, but was disqualified in the second round.
Another meeting was arranged, and after lniin. 7see.
the proceedings interested Mike no more. Some
people accused the loser of lying down, but it
is prettv evident that he was pushed. After that, he
was only onee in the ring, when he met Jack Lalor,
the idol of the Rand. The Idol got the decision.
Storbeck was one of the stalwarts who lined up
round the Johannesburg Trades Hall to protect the
Labor leaders what time the police and military from
the veldt trained Maxims on the forlorn hope of .
Great Strike. When lie is through with his Aus-
tralian trip he will hie him unto the Yewnited
States.
Though Half-Round Smith was outed in
Sydney Stadium by Eddie McGoorty it took quite a
crowd of wallops to put him definitely down and
out. When he got into the ring with Jimmy Clabby
on Saturday night he made a very fine start. 1 hen
flabby hit him twice, and in lmin. 20sec. from
the sounding of the gong he was being assisted to
his corner. Rage, disappointment, derision and
contempt sent forth a storm of hoots that literally
blew David Smith out of the big building, and, as
many thought, out of the boxing game. It was in
a clinch, and Smith neglected to protect himself.
He failed to hold Clabby, who, having both hands
free, very properly used them, and a neat uppercut
and a good left hook ended the battle in a moment.
The truth is that, since the disaster he endured at
the fists of McGoorty, Smith is no longer a fighter.
Writer has seen lots of examples of how one licking
will cow an erstwhile very stormy warrior. In the
timber districts of Hawkes Bay, Maoriland, there is
alwavs a little colony of men who, on pay week, keep
apart from the mass and drink quietly by themselves
and without violence. Writer once tried to hold up such
a party as an example to a drunken figfiting crowd,
and learned that the parties held up were the fellows
who had been hammered into a peaceable frame of
mind. Also, the writer knows that he himself has
not been the same war-like spirit he was before
“Totara Jack” smote him with a dead bull-pup at
the end of a chain. But in spite of this obvious fact
it is said that Reg Baker is going to give Half-
llound Smith another chance against Clabby at Bris-
bane. Reg Baker is a long-suffering Christian.
“Bilrock,” from Paris: How long, ye
prophets (and losses), must a much-harassed public

Johnson, Esq., champ, pug. and world's star buffoon?
If Yankee Moran is the best Pale Hope of the day,
then the cullud brndder need harbor no fear oi
losing his title, for Moran’s display at the Velodrome
D’Hiver on Saturday night last was that of a mere
tyro. The collision on the eve of the Grand Prix
drew some 10,000 sports, females and bloques to the
big saucer-track stadium, where the ring, under the
powerful einema. lights, looked like a sunspot on a
timbered waste. The crowd comprised the most re-
markable gathering that has attended a mill on this
side of the world for many a year. Pearls and dia-
monds sparkled on hundreds of bare necks. More
than half the ringside seats were occupied by women.
In addition to a baroness and a duchess, amongst the
bunch of titled dames were two princesses whose
titles can stand inspection, the diadem being blown
in the bottle. A duke and at least one earl- were
with the crowd of English snorts that crossed the
silver streak with the hope of seeing Johnson scat-
tered. At this time of the year Paris is half-full
of Americans, and there was a good deal of “guess-
ing” in nasal tones. Admission prices ranged from
seven to 250 francs, and it is said that Johnson will
receive between £5OOO and £6OOO as his share of
the brigandage. That Paris has tired of its ebony
idol was evidenced by the somewhat feeble applause
that greeted the Shady One and the storm of cheers
with Which the house hailed Moran. Followed by an
army of satellites that looked like one of the lost
tribes of Israel, Johnson entered the ring a picture
of inky arrogance. The Caretaker of the Diamond
Collar Stud removed a towel from his head. The
First Admiral of the Wardrobe relieved him of his
long dressing-gown of grey and black silk decked
with a white lace collar. Then all Africa stood
resplendent in blue plush knickers trimmed with
gold, and with the evidences of his laziness plainly
visible in the rolls of superfluous fat over his ribs.
For a space of five minutes the dusky Nabob gave an
exhibition of his histrionic powers that he has not
hitherto equalled. He fairly wallowed in the lime-
light. He preened before the public. He posed , tor
the cinema. He passed the glad grin over to : his
new white girl-wife sitting semi-clad in silk in the
front row. He smirked at the haute monde that
filled the £l2 10s. seats. He joshed the officials.
He was the High Panjandrum of Swank. In com-
parison with his Darkness, the Czar of all the
Russias would have figured as a grease spot. He
was supreme. He was It.
The ruddv Moran showed up pale by contrast, the
pallor of his skin accentuated by the fierce blaze
from the powerful white lights above the ring.
Moran is a splay-footed, bull-necked boxer with the
dimensions of aii elephant and the movement of a
snail. Alongside the nigger the Yankee’s efforts
seemed puerile. He did not even justify a claim to
the right to fight for the championship. Stiff and
awkward in his movements, he -advertised in the
plainest manner what he was about to do. Moran is
a boxer with a punch, but without the skill to use
it. Crafty as ever, Brud. John sing completely out-
generalled him from one end of the contest to the
other. Immaculate in flannels, Georges Carpentier,
who is himself looking Johnsonwards, refereed the
mix-up for the record fee of 10,000 francs.
The fight was disappointing. Only thrice in the
mill did Moran jar the dark streak. The last_ of
those accidents was a straight right to the jaw
which must have tasted like a bunt from a railway
locomotive. It brought a roar of approval from the
crowd, and a smile from Johnson, who stepped back
and joined in the applause by clapping his 4oz.
gloves. Twice in clinches Johnson resorted to an
old by-plav, standing perfectly still and allowing
Moran to pound his cast-iron stomach, while ho
flashed the golden grimace at the crowd. After the
tenth round, when he had the points well in hand,
Johnson toiled not neither did he punch. From this
stage onwards the scrap would have gladdened the
members of a Society for the Promotion of Peace.
One marvelled at the patience of the French citizens
in the galleries, who had parted with so many francs
to witness the fiasco. Time and again the alleged
“hope” came in head down, arms whirling like the
blades of a propeller, wide open to the knock-out,
and the Inky One merely toyed with him. He re-
ceived him as one receives an aged and wealthv
relative. He took him to his black bosom, patted
him affectionately on the back, and wiped the sweat
of his dusky brow on the white man’s shoulder.
Towards the finish the crowd went baresark. It
clamored in idiomatic French for the knock-out. It
reared itself upon its hind legs, and called the nig.
27 different kinds -of a loafer. But it moved him
not. The fiaht -ended in an uproar. Bv permission
of Mistah Johnsing, Moran had stayed the 20 rounds.

RITA MOYA discourses on
NATURAL BEAUTY,
and how to obtain it.
To-day every woman of taste and refinement avoids the use of cosmetics or made-up
toilet preparations which give an artificial appearance. The fresh, natural complexion that
few women have, and every woman desires, is best obtained by use of original ingredients
already at hand or which can be obtained from any reliable chemist. My advice is to avoid
the use of most made-up face creams, rouge and beautifying preparations. They are usually
obvious and often disappointing. If you will get only the proper original ingredients you will
be satisfied with the result. Insist on having what you ask for. If the chemist does not
happen to have it in stock, he can immediately get it from his wholesaler.
Good Shampoo Important.- —The hair should
he allowed to breathe, and the greasy film
around each strand must he removed with a
mild non alkaline shampoo. Soaps should he ]
tabooed. 'The very best solution for the pur-
pose can he made by dissolving a teaspoonful
of stallax granules in a cup of hot water. It
stimulates the scalp to healthy action, and at
the same time leaves the hair in that soft.
Huffy condition so much admired. Any chemist
can supply you with an original packet of
•stallax, suliieient. to make 25 or :»') shampoos.
Magic for Superfluous Hair. — ll is astound-
ing the number of women who suffer from
unsightly growths of hair on the face, and it
will come as a piece of good news to know
that there is a simple substance known as
powdered pheminol which will remove it im-
mediately and permanently. Mix a small
quantity into a thin paste with a little water,
and apply to the objectionable growths, in
two minutes all tract' of the hair will have
entirely vanished, and your skin will hi' as
soft, and smooth as a child's.
To have Smooth. White Skill all through the
Winter. —lines your skin chap or roughen
easily, or become unduly red or blotchy? bet
me tell you a quick and easy way to over-
come the trouble and keep your complexion
beautifully white, smooth and soft, .lust get
some ordinary mereolised wax at the chem-
ist's. and use a little before retiring as you
would use cold cream. The wax. through
some peculiar action, flecks off the rough, dis-
colored of blemished skill. The Worn-out
cuticle collies off just like dandruff 011 a dis-
eased scalp only in almost invisible particles.
Mereolised wax Simply hastens Nature's
work, which is the rational and proper way to
attain a perfect complexion, so much sought
after, but very seldom seen, The process is
perfectly simple and quite harmless.
Tor I)l‘.v, Irritating and ttandriiflV SealpS.
—-Nothing can compare with the following
recipe for the above condition, and until you
have rectified any trouble in this direction it
is useless to expect the hair to grow healthy
and vigorous. Mix a package of boranium
with -J - pint of bay ruin, shake the bottle well
and allow to stand for :*>() minutes, then add
1-pint cold water and strain. This simple
home remedy will stimulate the hair roots to
their normal functions, resulting in a beauti-
ful growth of new hair.
Kouge Not Necessary. -If you must add a
little color to the cheeks please do not use
rouge; il is always so painfully obvious that
women of refinement have now discarded it
for ever. There is a little-known substance
called colliandum obtainable at most chem-
ist's. which can be used in its place, it gives
a perfectly natural tint and defies tlie closest
scrutiny, besides having the undoubted ad-
vantage of not rubbing off.
The Ponder Puff Passes. -A persistently
shiny nose, or a dull, lifeless complexion
drives many a woman to cosmetics and conse-
quent despair. And all the time a simple
remedy lies at hand ill the holin', (let front
your chemist about an ounce of oleminite,
and add Sufficient water to dissolve it. A
little of tliis simple lotion is Nature’s own
beMutifier, It is very good for the skin and
instantly gives the complexion a soft, velvety,
youthful bloom that any woman might envy.
Il lasts all day Of evening, renders powdering
entirely unnecessary, and absolutely defies
detection.
Miscellaneous Jlints. —For lips inclined to be
rough or lidrsh use a soft stick of prolttcttiirl.
An ideal complexion soap is one called
pilenta. it Contains no free alkali. tind is as
near neutrality as science Can make it.
To make tire eyelashes grow long, dark and
curling, massage them gently with memullinC.
It is quite a harmless Substance, tind will hot
injure the eyes. ..

THE LONE NANP
The National
Honthly, 6d.
The Shark Turns.
“Gordon G.” applies for a stay of proceed-
ings :
This never-ending gufT against law and lawyers
makes me weary and angry all in one. I doubt
whether a search through ail the English literature,
from the time of old Bede to the present, would
reveal one writer who has had a good word for me
and my learned friend or the system we toil under.
They’re all the same—from Siinksi’kare and Dickens
to the brightest constellations on (he Melbourne
’Erai.ii. Whenever a writer is hard. up for copy, it
seems to be his practice to scratch his scalp and
produce a long-winded spasm on “Costly Litigation ’
or “The Law's Delays.” As a consequence, the aver-
age individual seems to regard the six-an’-eight pro-
fession and every body and thing connected with it.
as in the nature of a bad smell to lie carefully
avoided and harshly spoken of.
In the first place, Gent. One is abused as a
successful licensed plunderer with a tremendous
capacity for easily amassing the hard-earned wealth
of others. That is perhaps the chief grievance. For
this reason he is called “hog,” “shark” and other
predatory animals as hard and as often as possible.
But, as a matter of fact, Victorian statistics (which
are less or more reliable") show that “barrister and
solicitor” is eight lines down in a group of 12 tax-
payers, set out in a recent official income-tax list.
In the face of that, Gent. One can’t be called a.
well-fed shark, anyhow. Another fact worth noting
is that lawyers, although they have their own indus-
trial union, are the only people now who are work-
ing under Wages Board conditions which fix a maxi-
mum and not a minimum wage. And whenever a
scale of costs is altered by custom or competition
(there are “scabs” in this as in other professions),
or by legislative Act or judicial direction, it is
invariably reduced. Compare this with recent
changes in the charges of every other profession,
business, trade, occupation, job, game, pastime or
boil-over.
Certainly, neither barristers nor solicitors’ fees
have gone up in proportion to the increased cost of
living. On the contrary, they have gone • down —-
and, in many instances, with a wallop. Also, the
solicitor is, for some unaccountable reason, humili-
ated by being compelled to render signed detailed bills
of costs, with every trifling item specified and the exact
amount charged therefore set down against it. Fur-
ther, he is not allowed to sue for his account until
one month after it. has been delivered. No such
lestriction is placed on dentists or doctors or any-
body else. Even lawyers’ clerks, who, in the mass,
do the most responsible and important work in the
whole clerking world, have no semblance of a Wages
Board, and are, for the most part, underpaid by
bosses whose good old days of big bills are over and
done with. So much for the sordid monetary aspect.
Then, again, the same batch of writers, with the
same brilliant originality, make The Law synony-
mous with The Ass. The system whereby Gent. One
earns his humble crust undoubtedly does possess cer-
tain asinine qualities (for instance, a penchant for
moving leisurely), but, considering it has been the
carefully-evolved work of centuries on the part of
the most eminent judicial and other lights interested,
it is a trifle over the odds to decry the whole ami
every portion of it in a series of vague, sweeping
generalities. Admittedly, reform in law is needed.
But so is reform in nearly everything and in riianv
places more urgently.
Once more, the lawyer is credited with all the
cunning and roguery and chicanery usually attri-
buted to the Devi n. Vet, incongruously enough,
more men will be drawn from the ranks of lawvefs
to represent, the people in the next Federal I’arlnP
meiil; than from any other class of the community.
And a member of Barliament is said to he in a posh
t ion of t rust.
The truth about it is that the lawyer is tinder the
disadvantage of being one of the few whose work is
constantly and publicly reviewed and checked. Nearly
cierr little mistake or backslide is eagerly pounced on
by an opposing lawyer and triumphantly pushed in
front of a Judge. Further limelight effects are left to
the reporter and the leader-writer, and they do their
work with the ardor and thoroughness of men who
are capable of better tilings.
♦
The mourning of “0.K.” :
The need for closer settlement, and further agri-
cultural development in Victoria, has found new
expression in the cry of the Bendigo unemployed. It
ixn t Melbourne only that suffers from congestion of
the < ity. Bendigo, the second most crowded spot
in the State, has also got the complaint pretty
badly, and {migration offers no immediate cure for
that. Immigration under the present Vic. system, or
want of system, spells more congestion, for it is
only the boy portion of the human goods from ’Ome
that can be easily placed on the land to stay there.
One good effect of the Bendigo unemployed evil, how-
ever. is the Government’s promise to stir the Country
Hoads Board into action. Three or four hundred
men will be put to roadmaking, and a reasonable
country road does at least suggest a way of escape
to the townsmen employed in the making. Besides,
it ought to lie the most productive tract of land in
the district. The policy of waiting for casual settle-
ment to lead to the cutting of roads has given
Victoria the spotty appearance of a workhouse pud-
ding. wherein one large raisin and a few currants
break the dull monotony of suet. If the Board has
a notion of making roads that will lead to settle-
ment, every man on the job will produce .">0 times
the cost of bis wages. A path through the wilder-
ness for civilisation to travel is a more payable
proposition than a tunnel in a Bendigo mine.

“Fitzwilliam” : Will some earnest student
cl. economics please explain how the Work-
man is aided by the Hot.man brand of Labor
policy in this instance? Down in Kisuna
(N.K.W.). where the blue-metal comes from,
the quarries were run for some 2o years
by Private Enterprise, the metal being carted
to the railway and wharves in drays. This
gave employment to a large number of
drivers. A couple of years hack the Govern-
ment resumed the quarries. Instead of
drays it laid down a tramway. No fault
to lie found with that; hilt the two locomo-
tives were imported from the United States,
the trucks were imported front Germany, and
a new steamer to cope with tin* increased
output of metal was imported from Holland.
(The steamer sank off the W.A. coast, but
that didn't worry the Labor Government—
it ordered another.) I haven’t been able
to discover where the rails were imported
from —Japan, likely. The money that paid
for everything was imported from England.
As an added joy, the German trucks were
found to he too heavy for the United States
locomotives. New trucks were, of course,
procured locally—T don't think. They came
from Germany. T suppose it must' he all
right, else a Labor Government wouldn’t

I Saw My Love.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a subtle relation between mood and color.
. — Chatter.
I saw my love in pink arrayed,
And burned to clasp her to me-;
And every graceful turn she made
With magic potence drew me.
Again she passed in pearly grey,
To suit the varying fashion :
And though she seemed one half a fay
She raised no throbbing passion.
I saw her next in azure clad ;
No goddess swept diviner.
Unconsciously my heart grew glad,
Attuned to issues finer.
In violet silk anil Veiled niiion,
Sin- c-irtscyed in the Tango;
My heart-strings then were played upon
As gaily as a banjo.
But when she swept in old brocade
Attired by hands Parisian.
A flower >he seemed that could not fade, ■
A bloom of lands Elysian.
I wonder would it calm the mind
If Delia's garb were lmeless?
(tods, make her victim color-blind
Or make her beauty viewless!
QCEKNSIiANI).
PHILANDER. F.
“Curds and Woe” : The Australian cow
cocky is up against what is known as the
margarine menace. Butter easily fought Un-
original margarine, which was a crude com-
pound of animal fats. But to-day, in Lon-
don, a palatable and presentable product
from copra and other vegetable fats is being-
retailed as prime margarine at 6d. per
lb. To compete with this best butter
must sell at Is. per lb. in London, and it
hasn’t done that sort, of thing for a long
while; also the people concerned don't want
it to make the attempt. If Australia’s sur-
plus finished-efl'ort-of-the-cow has to be sold
in the best foreign market at Is., then the
price must dron locally, and the bull’s niece
may give up all hope of a new spring bonnet
to put on her horns, and a red ribbon to th-
ou her tail when it is her birthday. Of
course the cow will come again, even if she
suiters temporary eclipse, because the sources
of the new margarine supply are limited —
that is to say, she will come again unless
someone discovers a way of making edible
grease out of icebergs or mineral tailings, or
something hitherto unsuspected. But it looks
as if, for a few years, she might have to gird
up her caudal extremity and do an uphill
fight for her crust.
«.
A Melbourne woman lately evolved an
effective plan for getting rid of a superfluous
infant. She took it to a crbche, paid Is.,
and left it there. It is still there.
“Junior Bar”: The Bulletin mentions
(18/(5/T4) the “strange but usual judicial
assumption that a judge doesn’t know any-
thing beyond what counsel tell him.” That
is so. Called to the Bar in London, I some-
how got the idea that a judge knows all the
law there is, and would sweep aside the
spurious arguments of the Bar with a mas-
terly offhand statement of the correct article.
I shall never forget the first application I
made to an Australian judge—to allow or
disallow something. “But have I the power
to do this?” he asked me earnestly. “It
seems a deserving case, on the facts. But
can you show me that I have the power?”
“Well, d—n it all, your Honor,” I replied in
a firm tone, “I am getting a guinea for this
application, and it is probably what I’m
worth. You get £2OOO a year or thereabouts
for sitting there and hearing this sort of
tiling. Don’t you know whether you have
the power or not?” As I found afterwards
that nobody had heard this spirited outburst,
it is probable that I had only been thinking-
hard. But, anyway, it does seem that Aus-
tralian judges have more respect for the Bar
than is quite healthy for either side. What
a poor figure the Bench cuts, generally, when
there is any altercation between them! It
is difficult to imagine “one of ours” charging
a jury as I have heard the Lord Chief Justice
in London: “Gentlemen, the learned counsel
on either side have addressed you as though
the Constitution of England were at stake.
But, gentlemen, the Constitution of England
is not at stake. It appears to me a very
ordinary case for small damages”—and in
three minutes lie had straightened out the
legal tangle which had been getting worse
and worse in the previous three hours.
“D.” : If pugilism develops into a sort of
world-wide religion, as seems possible in view
of the fact that France and England are
lialf-inad about it. while neither America
nor Australia can be said to be absolute]v
sane on the question (and a measure of in-
sanity is notoriously the basis of all live
faiths) —in this event, I say, Hugh I).
Mclntosh, of Sydney, will have first claim on
the billet of Prophet. When Mclntosh pro-
jected himself into the fight business, half a
dozen years ago. pugilism was a furtive, dis-
reputable art carried on in dens by villainous-
looking principals, and in the presence,
chiefly, of tin- criminal classes. The National
Sporting Club, in Castlereagh-street, had
stood for the only attempt, in years, to make
stoush more or less respectable. It failed
utterly. Then out of the murk stepped
Mclntosh and showed the way to higher
things. . The Burns-Johnson contest was a
poor thing regarded as a sporting event, but
as a social function it was unimpeachable
From that day to this, in Australia, not only
have the crowds at boxing matches swollen
to a size that was unimaginable a few years
back, but they number some of the 'most
reputable people in the community. In Eng-
land people like ex-Prime Ministers attend
fights with their families. In France a box-
ing contest of importance is said to rival a
first night at the Opera House as regards
the costumes of the fashionable people who
sit in the front seats. And the genesis of it
all was in the brain of a small, resolute N.
S. Wales citizen whose chief financial asset
at the time was credit, and its Eden was a
Chinese garden in Rushcutter’s Bay. From
such paltry beginnings do the world’s great-
est superstitions invariable spring.

IN
BANANA LAND
“Cleveland”: Let me into this argument
about scooping harbors out of rivers, or bays
with rivers discharging into them. Queens-
land has a lot of these silt traps, which are
usually held up as shining examples of the
power of money. The following figures are
taken from the annual report of the Rock-
hampton Harbor Board for 1913. They
cover a period of 10 years, and apply to the
attempt to gouge out the Fitzroy River to,
enable ships to reach the town wharves: —
Average amount dredged and deposited,
per year . . . . . . . . 859,910 tops.
Average cost per ton, including in-
terest and depreciation .. .. 3.53, pence.
Average amount spent per year on
dredging . . .... .. £12,648
The average number of ships that used this
majestic wmterway was 361.3 per year.
Most of the shipping was of the
mosquito variety, averaging only 449 tons.
It would be rational to suppose that, after
experimenting for 16 years and spending
£202,365 for dredging alone, there would be
a marked improvement in the gutter; but
the number of ships that negotiated the.
streak during 1913 was only 238, which is
considerably less than the average for the 16.
years, viz., 361. During the whole period;
only 13 vessels of between 18 and 20 feet
draft went up the river, and none at all
since 1907! “Rockie” is singularly
blessed with so-called ports, having also got
Broadmount and Port Alma; and not one
of them is an honest, straightforward pro-
position. I would not have said a word only
that, while all this wild waste of public
money has been going on, the neighboring
Gladstone has been sleeping on an utterly
neglected natural harbor that could take the
whole of “Rockie’s” 16 years’ dredgings,
shipping, Harbor Boards and debt, and hide
them from the scandalised eyes of honest
men. And there would still be ample room
for the British fleet, an odd coaster and an
occasional barramundi.
The luck of some railway trains ! The
other day a tender ran for 19 miles into
Ipswich with a broken axle, from which an
18-inch section was missing. It waltzed
alopg Soppily and damaged, neither goods
nor passengers. A trifle of this sort might
easily have cost a less lucky Department
£20,000 in compensation.
Brisbane Courier! funeral notice (July
27)
The friends of Mr. Ji. Christopher Columbus are
respectfully invited to, attend his funeral, to move
from his late residence, Petrie Ter,race, this after-
noon at 4 o’clock, to the Toowong Cemetery.
Mark Twain’s Innocent Abroad, who para-
lysed the Italian guide by asking, in refer-
ence to thp statue of the great Genoese
navigator, “Is he dead?” ought to be quite
satisfied now.
Staunch old Queensland navigator Cap-
tain W. Collin, who died some few months
ago, has had, his life’s story put into !a book
by his, sop. Collin knew aU the vicissitudes
of a sailor’s life: —mutiny, shipwreck,, starva-
tion and arrest. He was on board the
Grimeneza, whep that yellow hulk wept down
with 600 cooli.es on the Bampton Reef.
Ope patch of his experiences, while drifting
after the wreck :
On the fifth morning before daylight a Bengalee
boy, one of the crew, rushed into my arms as I sat
in the stern of the boat, declaring that the men were
about to kill and eat him. I declared they should
not do him any harm; but there was no telling how
long I might be able to . protect him.
He hints that such grim experiences were
commqn epough in those days. “Jolly tars
were our men,” but their playful habits
weren’t always relished by their prospec-
tive victuals.
“-P.F.” : Queensland's way of treating its
neuropaths is more insane than Bedlam
itself. Some months ago a half-demented
female burnt down the Salv’army’s home at
Taringa, under a blind delusion that she was
wreaking vengeance on someone. Two
deaths resulted from that horror. No con-
viction was recorded against the incendiary,
as her mental condition was only too evi-
dent. Since then she has made more than
one appearance before the police court, and
distinguished herself recently by smashing
the plateglass front of a drapery store*
What blazing folly to allow a person of this
kind to ramble at large! Arson, man-
slaughter, wilful damage to property are, it
seems, insufficient to justify the deprivation
of a lunatic’s liberty, while the asylum at
Goodna harbors scores of people whose only
crime against society is that they imagine
the, moon is a pork-pie, or Joe Cook the
Great Mogul. Is it Queensland’s belief that
every crazy person should be. allowed one
case of arson, just as a dog is allowed to
hfve his one bite without incurring legal
penalties?
N.S.W. Justice Pring, sitting as a Com-
missioner on the Boorabil land-resumption
business, got square on to the jaw of the
men who mix the jobs of land agent and
M.P. “What would you do,” asked Pring,
“if a deal in which you had acted as agent
for the vendor came up in Parliament for
approval?” “I wouldn’t vote, of course,”
said the virtuous agent M.P., and thought
that ended it. But it didn’t. “Exactly!’
remarked Pring. “You would sacrifice your
public duty to your private interests.”
“Praeco,” regarding a new baronet: —
A most interesting little personage is Sir Robert
Nivison, the mighty atom who underwrites the
public loans of India, Canada and Australasia. In-
cidentally, he underwrites the Metropolitan Board of
Works (Melb.) loans, though that is not generally
understood'. Most of the big corporation loans
floated by the capital cities of Australia are nominally
underwritten by local brokers, but in reality by
Nivison, for whom they merely act as agents on
fractional commission. The public frequently won-
ders how Mr. So-and-So, of the Melb. Stock Ex-
change,. or Mr. This-and-That, the Sydney share-
broker, can offer to find half a million so easily
when it is all poor So-and-So or This-and-That can
do to pay the rent of two small dingy rooms. Most
of the big debenture issues of Melbourne and Sydney
lie snugly in the vaults of the London and West-
minster Bank, where “Bobby” Nivison was once a
bill-clerk, getting £l5O a year at 30 years of age. He
& nicknamed “the Canary,” because the feathers
on his face are yellow, his legs are thin, and he
sings ballads. It is not known whether he moults
occasionally, and is given duckweed and mutton-
fat. Nivison is very like the late W. A. Zeal, Presi-
dent of the Vie. Leg. Council, except that he is
not snappy. On the contrary, he is a suave, bland'
little chap from Aberdeen, whose self-admitted
habits, according to Who’s Who, are giving good*
dinners and' collecting big commissions. And nobody
ever makes the mistake of thinking Nivison is a 1
glorified bank clerk. He is easily the most astute'
man amongst the 4000 London stockbrokers.
From the “Old Soldier” :
The murder of Jaures, the millionaire leader of f
the extreme Radical group in the French Chamber,,
may affect the European situation. Says the cable:'
“The murderer belongs to a royalist organisation,
and' is the soft of a law-court official at Rheims'. He
declares that' he had shot M. JaurOs because of the'
latter’s attempts to maintain international peace.”
The organisation in question is the old “Camelots*
du Roi,” who, for more than 40 years, have been 1
trying, by murder, conspiracy, etc., to restore the
Bourbons. The Boulanger and Dreyfus scandals 4
were their achievements, and now they seem ready
to, disunite France, merely to give the Orleans gang
and the Bonapartes a chance of pushing their rival’
claims. The kingly possibilities are the Duke of
Orleans and Victor Bonaparte, son of “Plon-Plon,”’
known in soci-iy as Prince Napoleon. He used to-
have a commission in the Russian army, but, since'
Russia lias become France’s ally, be has been dis-
pensed with for obvious reasons. So he has settled!
down in Brussels as the husband of the late King
Leopold’s managing daughter, Clementine, who is-
lavishing her father’s money on an attempt to get 1
her husband on to a French Imperial' throne.
Day.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Like the swift beat of rain along the Quay
Come the doomed feet of market-driven
sheep,
Under the figs that gloom the river’s edge
Some night thing stirs and shivers at the
dawm,
For, after all, the wine-flushed sleep was
best
And the drugged grief that slumbered in
the brain
Grows clear beneath the gold search-light of
day,
Unkind to that confused dishevelment.
Sparrows, alert, take plunges in their bath
Of dew or dust, across the grass-fringed
walk.
A lily lifts from by the paling fence
The scalloped goblet of its sensuous red,
And one moonflow'er, where all the rest are
blind.
Will not forget the naked lady, who
The night long kept her Queenshlp of the
sky,
But through the ashen leaves, still wude-
eyed, yearns
After the pale abandon of her heams.
Though Day makes empty Love’s regretful
arms
And Night’s dear nearness is prim-cloaked
again.
Beneath the kerchief decorously spread
Sweet subtle achings swell the hidden breast
Where his warm kisses, soft as petals fell!

Brisbane, August 1, 1914.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
This has not been a particularly gay week,
although the squattocracy are flocking into
town, so as to get in a bow or bend or a
scrape and forelock tug when the Governor-
General’s august presence overshadows the
lilliputian landscape and stills the war-
throb in the air. All human accommodation
in the hotels is booked up. Humble ani-
mals, however, are still being catered for in
the stables, kennels and bars. The which
is all so much wasted energy. Australia’s
most expensive Governor has been hurriedly
dragged from Sydney (his half-way house
to Brisbane) back to Melbourne, where he
will open foreign despatches and hand them
for Consideration to the collective intelli-
gence, wisdom, discernment, craft and dip-

assembling at Brisbane will not be disap-

pointed altogether. The annual Sho\v; is
some sort of recompense.
Leslie Harris, one of oui; prettiest girls,
has contracted herself matrimonially to one
Bullivant, a Victorian squatter, and is
gathering in her trousseau for the wedding,
which will take place towards the end of
the year.
The naval and military ball last night was
a mighty and uplifting success. The South
Brisbane City Hall was made beautiful with
palms and blue and white drapings, also by
the presence of the Lieutenant-Governor
and his nice, cheerful wife, Inspector-Gen-
eral Briggs, Colonel and Mrs. Lee, Colonel
and Mrs. Bruche and Colonel Sutton. The
tout ensemble (which is no relation to race-
horse touts, my dear) was pleasingly effec-
tive. The men outnumbered the girls by
just about three, so that there were no
wallflowers. :
Miss Monje, of your State, was among the
dancers. She wore a becoming black and;
tan confection, glittering with diamonds.
Among the representatives of local femininity
were Mrs. Espie Dods (in black), Gladys
Pollard (in green), and Lottie Bond (in
peacock blue). Mrs. White, of Pikedale,
chaperoned two handsome daughters.
Mrs. Packer, a member of the Wimmen’s
Patriotic Club, Sydney, is visiting here, and
will stay until after the marriage of Miss
Constance Bloom and Mr. Spiegel.
Mrs. John Hicks gave a cheerful tea party
on Wednesday, in honor of Miss McCut-
cheon, of Melbourne. About 30 celebrants
assembled and were given rations in the con-
servatory. Daughter Gladys kindly assisted;
her mother in the work of distribution. She,
by the way, recently acquired the diamond
half-hoop of impending matrimony from a
northern banking man.
Mischa Elman and Eva Gauthier arrived
here on Wednesday night. They gave their
first concert on Thursday, when Mischa,
looking oddly gnome-like on the huge Exhibi-
tion platform, and in the bad light (it was
mostly shadow where Mischn was), plucked
the quivering soul out of his violin and
offered it (the q.s.) to the audience at the
advertised price.
Eva, wearing the greater portion of some
black-plumed bird in her head-vegetation,
warbled musically. Feminine Brisbane had
had hopes of seeing the lady in a purple wig,
and was disappointed, but it couldn’t get its
money back at the doors. However, it took
some comfort in committing to memory the
lines of her old gold frock.
Antonia Dolores arrived back from the
North on Thursday, and left for the Downs
on the following day. She will return next .
Friday, and will give two concerts in Exhi-
bition week.
The amateur golf championship of :
Queensland was played off this week and
was won by E. Fitzpatrick. He was the
winner in 1011.
The shortsightedness of the Government
in appointing the German Consul to a seat
in the Legislative Council is as nothing to
the mole-like blindness of whoever was re-
sponsible for putting the. same alert gentle-
man into a chair of directorship at the
Queensland National Bank. I’m expecting
any minute to hear that Prime Minister
Asquith has cabled produce-storeman Den-
ham for the whyfor of the joke which enables
the official representative of an ever-menac-
ing foreign Power to help run an Australian
State.
Just before the battle, Thargo, while the
dove of peace in vain beats against war’s
cruel embargo, I remain,

JANE.
THEY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The World’s Peace Congress, which was to have
met in Vienna next September, has cancelled its
meeting.— Cable.
It’s many years ago they told young John to get his
gun;
No doubt expecting that the lad would like to see
the fun.
And then they went away, asserting: “After all, it’s
wrong;
There’ll be no war; fair Peace will reign from
Belgrade round to Bhong.’’
But John had cleared like Holy Smoke —’twas just
as well he had;
He brought his rifle back with him, which made them
very sad;
They said: “You are too hasty, John; you see, we
quite forgot
We meant to hold a meet of prayer upon this very
spot!”
Just then Hans threw a brick at John, who promptly
turned and fired,
And thereupon the row began—and they at once
expired!

ANAEMIA
and Weakness
in Men, Women, and Children
Dr. ANDREW WILSON writes:
“It can be definitely sorted
“that Iron ‘Jelloids’ constitute
“ the most effective and desirable
“treatment for Anaemia or Poor-
“ness of Blood. The sufferer is able
“to take Iron ‘Jelloids’ without danger,
“even with pleasure, and with the sure
“knowledge that benefit will accrue.”
and re “MEN AND TONICS.”
“ There is a curious notion entertained by
“ the General Public that Iron Medicaments
“ are necessary for women only, and not for
“ Men. This is an erroneous idea. Now I
“ have found the form of Iron ‘ Jelloids ’ put
“up with Quinine (cilled Iron ‘Jelloids’
“No. 2a) to be an excellent tonic for men,
“and may be specially recommended.”
fdh
Breathing, hurried and gasping, on the slightest exertion, pale cheeks
lacking the ruddy glowof health, bloodless lips, a general feeling of weari-
ness-accompanied maybe by pain after food, indigestion—constipation,
listlessness, inability of application to any pursuit or even train of thought
depression of spirits, and irritability of temper. Such symptoms indicate
Anaemia, and should, on no account, be neglected.
p.
will remove the causes and symptoms of Anaemia. Iron is
what your system requires. By taking it in the form of Iron
‘ Jelloids ’ the not uncommon disadvantages of other Iron
tonics are avoided. No ill-effects are set up. No constipation.
No “ rust ”in the stomach. No danger of non-absorption.
No fear of injury to the teeth. If you would have radiant
health, an elastic step and well-braced nerves, you must
have healthy blood. To improve and strengthen the blood
take Iron ‘Jelloids,’ commended by Medical Men, and
favourably reviewed 1 by the Medical Press. As a general
tonic Iron ‘Jelloids ’ are excellent. They are pleasant and
easy to take.
A Reliable Tonic
Mrs. G. V. Marks, Hawkchurch, Axminster, England, ivrites: “Both
the Kector and myself have derived great benefit from Iron ‘Jelloids.’ I
have also given them to young girls suffering from Anaemia, and have
been very pleased with the results. I have known and recommended
Iron ‘Jelloids ’ for about 12 years.”
A Fortnight’s Trial (price 1/6) will
convince you.
IRON JELLOIDS ARE SOLD BY ALL CHEMISTS IN AUSTRALIA.

A SENSE of satisfaction is experienced
every time one wears a pair of Bos-
tock boots, and. from this consciousness
of their fine quality springs a natural agd
legitimate pride. One feels that they wilhj
contribute to ease" and elegance on the most
exacting occasions, and one knows that their
high quality will “be recognised every time
they are handled. This sense of satisfaction
is the inevitable effects of the choice leather
and beautiful work So conspicuous in every
pair of Bostocks. They are the cream of
imported boots.

Colin Clout: Your proposal that every
worker of every sort be compelled by Act of Parlia-
ment to be a unionist is duly noted. But, after all,
the great point about a unionist is that he proves, in
a general way, a better worker and a better citizen
than a non-unionist. And if the non-unionist is
abolished, then the unionist can’t be better. As soon
as everybody is roped in, then everybody is on the
same level, and is just a human being. What is the
good of an Act to compel each human being to be a
human being? Unionism, like many other move-
ments, will probably die of complete success. Prefer-
ence to unionists depends on the survival of the man
who stands out. With no man standing out, it would
be preference to all people—which would be prefer-
ence to no person. Some day the unions may be
reduced to paying a few people to be hostile....
John W.: “Casindra” is the thinnest possible skeleton
of a story. The only sign of life or fluff or meat
about it is the entrance of a pet animal, which may
be a cat or a tame gorilla or almost anything. , Of
course, it isn’t an eel. No pet eel ever walks in....
T.S.H.: It is a musical fragment, but it is only
music. A quarter-century ago a humorist published
a picture of a mild and weeping curate discoursing
soft verses to a Dorcas meeting. And when he read:
Sweet lady mine who —ah —glitterest
In shimmah of summah athwart the lawn,
Canst tell me which —er —is bitterest —
The glimmah of eve or the glamali of dawn,
the Dorcas meeting wept also. There is something of
that same soft nothingness about .your verses. Yet
you can write. Go out and kill a bullock and pen a
virile howl about Blood. Go and kill a money-lender
and turn his corpse into verse. Slay a solicitor.
Throw a cabman into the harbor. In fact, get a real
live subject. .. .327th Duke of Derrimut: The differ-
ence between an allodile and a crocogator has been
related till it becomes a weariness.... Harold J.
Brown: The Red Page never cursed those novels of
Harrison; the curse came from the U.S., and the
Red Page merely quoted it, mentioning its original
roosting place. Opinion of “V.V.’s Eyes” was.
printed on August 14, 1913. .. ..June T: No prize
was offered by Red Page for the “Australienne’s.
Creed.” All that was promised was the publication
of the best creed submitted. Five of the best were
printed, and, as usual, space rates will be paid to
the authors on application. .. .M.D. II.: Not bad; but
we don’t care for the allegorical form. And, apropos
your covering letter, remember, “Easy writing makes
hard reading.”. ..-A.8.: Written, apparently, for
the girl's Album of Stodge, and suitable for the pur-
pose, .. .Vamper: Gush. We prefer grit.... Stewart
Gee: All rather commonplace. .. .Revka.v : Ingenious.
But somehow it recalls the ingenuity of a man in
Adelaide who fixed up a most skilful device for
keeping alligators out of his fowlyard. .. .Isa: Lamb
without mint sauce. .. .Jobber: Don’t remember your
letter.... Trapper: You’re a good starter, but you
fail at the post.... Gladys M. P.: Smooth little
trickle, which ran over the rocks without a murmur.
Tyrone: Smartly written. Pity there wasn’t.
more to write about.... Quilibet: Lines from your
sonnet on your sister's birthday:—
And when, fair maid, abroad thou tak’st thy ways
The. stricken swains in wonder stand to gaze,
The little feathered choir forget their song,
The traffic standeth still in dumb amaze.
Why, what's wrong with her? Skirt split more than
usual, or what?....G.: Received, one epic, in 220
lines of verse. We might have printed it only you
forgot to give it a title, and if we chanced it and
called it a history of the world, and it turned out
to be a recipe for frying onions, see what a row
there would be.... Sydney S.: Not quite the sort of
thing we’re looking f0r.... Rudolph : “Kookaburra”
has no value at a 11.... Minnie S.: Rather neat; but
subject overdone. ...Lil May: Received, 12 poems,
“the product of three months’ illness.” f Please
keep well. ...W.J.11.: The hut-door with the message
on it, and the squatter who couldn’t read and rode
off with the door to get it deciphered, positively
refuse to support another par, let alone a ballad....
J.W.E.: “Midnight Scare” falls flat.... Stephanie:
“Progress” may be a very good “morality.”. But it
is outside the limits of our space, and we don’t print
plays, anyhow tkT.B.: Cheerful doggerel, which
would have dodged the basket if it had.
been a bit better brushed and combed....
M.S. (Waverley) : Seven out of your 13 pars,
•either began with “recently,” or that word
appeared in the first few lines. One of the “recent”
events happened on June 24, and three of those that
weren’t “recent” are a couple of months old. There
was a rumor a day or two ago that there’s to be a
Double Dissolution shortly. You are hereby com-
missioned to write it up when it comes 0ff....
J.H.G.: A straight wins. .. .R.N.C.: Too bellow-
dramatic. .. .J H.: Oh, yes, there’s nothing the
matter with the rhymes. But we should hate to
buy a pair of horses simply because their tails
matched beautifully... .Zamia: No bite in it....
E.J.W.: “Enigma” unsuitable... .E.K.8.: “Wild
Duck” is a dead bird—killed by such expres-
sions as “his eager scream rang out like a bolt
from the blue.” And, if he’d escaped death from
that cause, he had about 11 other fatal diseases
Jane: Lay your head on his shoulder, Janet, turn
your face to. his breast and then whisper the verse
into his shell-like or cauliflower ear. .. .Bertrand
Stewart (London) : Clipping not original and too
vague to be :of value.... Billie the . Goat: Been
printed many times... .S. J. Smith: Have read your
fin„ncial propositions. Don’t like them. In the
words of Shakspeare (put into the mouth of Wolsey
and quoted from memory): “O Smith, Smith, put
away ambition! By it fell the angels! By it, also,
fell the City of Melbourne Bank, which hurt many
people a darned sight worse.”... .Beatrice D.: Good
•craftsmanship in it. But why not blaze a track for
yourself?... .Rudbed: Well, it's better than it looked.
. ...Cerici: Your muse is an uncertain lady. One
minute she’s soaring ; the next she's down scrubbing
the f100r... .Alison H.: You own a dreadful anti-
climax, t 00... .Robert L. J.: There’s little fault to
be found with 15-year-old Bobby's rhythm and
rhymes. In (say) seven years, when he's also got
some ideas, we'll be glad to hear from him!.’... ’
Nicco Mach: Sorry no grip in it. .. . W.J .P.F.: Pay-
ment is made when claimed for, no matter what
column the stuff is printed in.

DIAMONDS
REDUCED ENORMOUSLY
Never before in the experience of Australia were so many
Diamonds sold as last year. Our Sales were Enormously
Large.
WHY?
Well, we some years ago took on a Sole Agency calling
for an enormous output, and to live up to it we decided to
offer Diamonds at merely a broker’s commission above
cutters’ landed cost.
The first year it did not pan out too well; the second
year the very large output told, and so we are continuing
the experiment for another year.
We only sell the Higher Grade of Diamonds, but our
prices are lower than those of London.

Avoca, Vic. —“Some time ago a rash came
out hll over my body, arms and legs. It
used to itch something terrible. After a
while I broke out in a sort of boils, which
were very painful, and I tried various reme-
dies without avail. Then I got some Cuti-
cura Ointment and after a few applications
of the Cuticura Ointment they disappeared
entirely. I also may mention that my
brother crushed his finger while working in
a mine. He applied Cuticura Ointment
with splendid results and would not be
without it.” (Signed) C. G. French,
October, 1912.
UNSIGHTLY ECZEMA ON FACE
7 Phelps St., Surry Hills, N. S. W.—“l
had for many years been tortured with
eczema on my face. It seemed to como
with each winter and was very unsightly
and painfully itchy, usually appearing on
the forehead and nose. I tried several
remedies but with no effect. Accidentally
I tried Cuticura Ointment, which I applied
as directed, and have never had eczema
since. I have also used Cuticura Soap,
which whon I first tried for the hair com-
pletely removed every vestige of dandruff.”
(Signed) Mrs. Janet Ashton, October, 1912.
Cuticura Soap and Ointment do so much
for poor complexions, red, rough hands, and
dry, thin and falling hair, and cost so little,
that it is almost criminal not to use them.
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment are
sold throughout the world. Liberal sample
of each mailed free, with 32-p. Skin Book.

HAVE YOU GOT
CATARRH ?
If you have a dropping; of phle&m Into the throat,
If your nose is stopped up,
If crusts form in your nose,
If you are easily susceptible to colds,
If you suffer from frontal headaches,
If you have noises in the head,
If your hearing is affected,
If you have to clear your throat & expectorate often,
If a change in the weather affects you,
If you are a victim to shortness of breath,
If you sneeze frequently,
If your sense of smell is affected,
If you have a heavy, tired feeling on awaking,
If you suffer from a husky throat,
If you are affected with any of the above symptoms,
the chances are that you are suffering from
Catarrh. It is an exceedingly dangerous com-
plaint, and is so insidious that the sufferer hardly
realises how serious is his or her condition until
matters have reached an almost chronic stage.
itarrh often begins with a cold in the head, but it never stops there.
j_he simple cold becomes a protracted one, while the discharge from the
nose grows more profuse and uncomfortable.
The inflammation extends to the throat and bronchial tubes, causing
hoarseness, a tickling sensation, and an aggravating cough. The matter
that is continually dropping back into the throat finds its way into the
stomach, resulting in a distressing form of dyspepsia, nausea, and loss of
appetite and strength.
The catarrhal poisons are absorbed into the blood, and all the membranes
of the body become infected, and what was supposed to be a purely local
.disease has become constitutional, deep-seated, and chronic, and may
eventually result in Deafness, Bronchitis, Asthma, Neuritis, Catarrh of
the Stomach, or that dread scourge of the human race, Consumption.
A Sample Bottle of “ KAT-AR-AH ” INHALANT
Free to Sufferers .
“ Kat-ar-ah ” Treatment for Catarrh is based on scientific principles,
and aims at the curing of the trouble on an entirely new and logical
basis. I know it is right by personal experience—the best Catarrh
Remedy in existence, and I am ready to prove it to you. Hundreds
acknowledge its worth. No matter how many remedies you may have
tried do not consider your case hopeless until you have tried “Kat-ar-ah”
Treatment.
In order that you may prove the value of this Treatment to your own
satisfaction. I will supply you with a trial bottle of “ Kat-ar-ah” Inhalant
FREE OF CHARGE. It will give immediate relief to the inflamed
membranes, clear the head, convey health-giving, purifying and germ-
destroying medicated air to the affected parts, and cleanse the nasal
passages of the accumulated mucous. I will also send you a copy of my
new and interesting booklet—“ Catarrh—its Cause, Symptoms and
Treatment.” Be sure to mention this paper when writing, give your
full name and address, and enclose 3d. in stamps to cover cost of postage.
Send to-day. The trial bottle will be sent by return mail. HERBERT

“The Jib”: Socialism has stalked forth
unexpectedly at Nukualofa, in the Tongan
Islands. The Union S.S. (M.L.) Co. re-
cently entirely altered the service between
Auckland and these islands, and to show
there was no ill-feeling elevated the saloon
fare, likewise the freight rates. These pre-
sents, added to the general inconvenience of
not being able to get fruit away regularly
(to say nothing of not knowing when beads,
mirrors and safety razors from Auckland
were going to arrive) has proved the last
and most ultimate straw ; so the little group
of islands is going to get a boat of its own.
Capt. Anderson, well and favorably known
all over the Pacific, is at the head of the
venture, which has been promised the whole
of the trading support of the group, as well
as a subsidy from the Tongan Government.
A steamer of modern design, specially built
for carrying fruit, has been ordered, and
skipper Anderson goes Londonwards shortly
to bring it out. So it looks as if the Union
Co. is due to get the axe right in tin' small
of the back this time. Still, you never can
te!l. .
“Black Swan”.: The W.A. State Steam-
ship Western Australian, which is so in-
dustriously assisting Premier Scaddan to
pile up his deficit, is a craft with a history.
It was built by an Austrian firm to the
order of the Russian Government, and was
intended to act as a hospital ship .and tender
to the Bear’s navy at the time the Jap. was
making trouble. It did act in the former
capacity for a time, and then took home a
cargo of wounded after tin 1 lamentable at-
tempt of Admiral Rockywhisky to fight im-
possible odds at Tsushima. It is a fast boat
and can still do IS knots when asked, but
has no special fitness for the Nor’-West
trade, having been built for something quite
different. A kangaroo may be first-class in
its own line, but it doesn’t follow that it will
be much good in a plough. And the best,
chimpanzee, if taken away from its tree and
set to preaching, may fail to draw a congre-
gation.

“Silas Snell”: This is Porter’s story.
Porter had been wakeful, and, after counting
all the sheep in creation and trying 25 other
infallible methods of provoking sleep, he
was wider awake than ever. So he got
up, and, feeling his way out of the dark hotel
vibrant with the snores of SO boarders, he
walked along the adjacent pier, and studied
moonlight effects on the moderately-troubled
waters. New interests developed with the
appearance of a couple standing on the
extreme end of the pier, hand in hand, look-
ing down into the sea. The hour was
2 a.m., no time for poetic canoodling,
and Porter’s sudden belief was strengthened
when the couple joined forces in a convul-
sive embrace. lie was just in time to pre-
vent them going overboard, locked in the last,
long hug. “Here, here ! What’s all this
aboutV’ said Porter. “It looks infernally
suspicious,” he added after a pause. The
man answered him, “Go away, do,” he said.
“This is no business of yours. If people
won’t let us live, they’ve got no right to stop
us dying.” “That be d —d for a yarn!” an-
swered Porter. “What’s your trouble?
Come, cough it up ! There should be another
way out.” “Our trouble is this. We are
immigrants, and strangers, and broke. To-
morrow we’ll be starving. We have tried,
and we can’t get a living in this country.
That seems the simplest way out.” He
pointed down Into the water. Porter took
each by an arm. “Give it another chance,”
he said. He towed them off the pier.
"Here’s two quid to help you over,” he added.
“Now get a move on. or I’ll give you in
charge.” A week'later Rogerson, another'
lodger, told at dinner an interesting tale
of saving a young couple who were just
going to throw themselves from the pier.
Rogerson had given them a sovereign, and
exacted a promise that they would buck up
and endeavor to beat their troubles.

“ J.F.H.”: Resist the temptation, and
don’t be a Rabbi. I thought once that it
was " a pretty good trade; but, from all
accounts, here in England it’s so rotten that
the union is demanding a living wage and
seriously talking strike. The London syna-
gogues attended by the Rothschilds and
other big moneylenders who hold Australia
in pawn pay their ministers pretty hand-
somely; but in the provincial cities little
Rachel scarcely has a hanky to wipe her nose
with. At a mass meeting of the wildest
rabbis, one of them declared that “the suf-
ferings and privations of our colleagues in
charge of provincial congregations have
reached a point which appeal with overmas-
tering force to the feelings and consciences
of the brethren in the more favored incum-
bencies.” As Australia contributes a pretty
good percentage of the income of the Cohens
of England this seems to be a case in which
King O’Malley or somebody should inter-
vene.

“Hamer”: A Sydney firm burst its bottle
the other day when a cable came from Eng-
land announcing that the Wine Trade Club
had tasted a number of samples of the juice
of different countries, and had decided that
one particular brand was “head and shoul-
ders above the others.” The firm, which fizzed
over with indignation, declared that it had
no samples in the competition; if it had,
there would have been one other brand two
storeys at least over everything else. As the
wine which actually did the trick was the
brand of another Commonwealth firm, Aus-
tralia has nothing to complain about in
the verdict, which is merely another of the
“firsts” that this country secures as a
matter of habit. Though the trade is still
young, Australian wine already circulates in
England much more freely than knowledge
of the country that produces it. A Birming-
ham paper recently reported the remarks of
one prominent man in the trade: “We send
Australia bad convicts and it sends us good
wine.” The speaker was merely a trifle out
of date; or, again, he may have been think-
ing of friends of his who have been sent
“abroad” lately.

TWO FAVORITES-
Gwen Burroughs and Rexona
January Bth, 1914.
Rexona Proprietary Company,
SYDNEY.
Dear Sirs, —
You have heard I have
been using Rexona and Rexona
Soap. This is quite true, and I
want to tell you what I think of
them. They are both simply
excellent. I always keep a pot
of Rexona on my dressing-table,
and consider it simply indispen-
sable. I always use it alter
Surfing, and find it simply
splendid for Sunburn, and for
preserving, the skin.
As for Rexona Soap it is won-
derful how lovely it makes the
hair, so soft and silky, and it is
so refreshing. I think every
girl should use Rexona Soap,
and I am sure I shall never miss
an onportunity of recommend-
ing both Rexona and Rexona
Soap.
Yours sincerely,
(Sgl) GWEN DAY BURROUGHS.
Miss Gwen Burroughs is an accomplished
actress as well as a beautiful woman. Her
Iris in “Ben Ilur" is well remembered as
a fine study of the East. “If ever I lived be-
fore,” says Miss Burroughs, “I was Eastern;
my blood thrills in interpreting such charact-
ers.” Miss Burroughs’s last appearance
was in “Within the Law” ; her next will be
in “Joseph and Ilis Brethren,” shortly to be
produced by the J. C. Williamson Co., Ltd.

MISS GWEN BURROUGHS,
{from a photo.)
Miss Burroughs is a strong advocate of Rexona and Rexona Soap; she has
used them both.
Everybody’s Using it Now.
Rexona Soap and Ointment are universal favorites with everyone
who values a pure and healthy skin. Rexona will at once heal all the
minor injuries to the skin as well as the more serious ones, and Rexona
Soap protects the user from disease, and insures both health and beauty.
Rexona Soap is sold everywhere at 1/- per tablet, and Rexona is supplied
only in triangular tins at 1/0 and 3/-

JU
The Positive, SAFE Cure for
HEADACH E AND NEURALGIA.
SUFFERERS from these torturing ailments will
welcome the advent of Dr. Stohr’s Kephahlol.
Hitherto the use of most so-called remedies has
been attended with the gravest danger on account of
their injurious effect on the heart and other organs.
Kephaldol may be taken with absolute safety. In
thousands of cases it acts instantaneously—acts where
other remedies have proved useless. Yet its use isrf
never attended by any ill after-effects. It has been
recognised as a perfectly harmless remedy by the medi-
cal profession, who have made regular and prolonged
trials of it in their clinics, on thousands of patients.
Get a tube of Kephaldol from your chemist to-day, and
never be without a supply.
h
For Lumbago
Until now there has been no certain remedy for
the Lumbago sufferer. All who arc subject to
this painful affection know well the sufferings
that characterise it: stiffening of the back, im-
possibility of making the slightest movement
without agonising pain—enforced rest and im-
mobility, etc. To-day there is no reason to
suffer any longer—lvephaldol will positively
relieve and cure you. This marvellous remedy
has the power of acting on the lumbar nerves at
the exact source of the evil, and a couple of
tablets taken at the beginning of the attack
will quickly disperse your pains, never to return.
Ivephaldol is equally effective even if your Lum-
bago is of long standing. Relief will be almost
immediate, and in a few days the pains will be
dispersed entirely. Ivephaldol is a safe and
certain cure for Lumbago, endorsed by thou-
sands of medical men throughout the world.
Sold in Tubes by Chemists and Storekeepers.
Prices, 1/6 and S/6.
See what the Doctors say
“I have used Kephaldol in Neuralgic
Headache with very good results. As an
efficient antineuralgic it is a thing not
to he missed.”
—Dr. J. Boss, M. 8., Penistone, Yorks.
“1 have pleasure in stating- that
Kephaldol was tried in a ease of Lum-
bago with a rapidly beneficial result.”
—Dr. J. Johnson, Stoke-on-Trent.
If any difficulty in procuring locally, a tube-will I>c sent post free direct by the
Manufacturers upon receipt of postal note to value of tube desired.

“I ’ope,” I ses, “’e snuffed it quick an’

An’ that wus ’ow I made me first deboo.
I'd dodged it cunnin’ fer a month er two.
Doreen, she ses: “You’ll ’ave to mee’t my

I’d pichered some stern dame ’oo’d snarl an’

An’ put the fear o’ God into a chap ;
An’ ’ere wus muvver, stokin’ scones an’ tea,
An’ drippin’ moischer like a leaky tap.

I felt so stiff an’ brittle-like me self.
Clobber? Me trosso, ’ead to foot, wus noo —
Got up regardless fer this interview.
Stiff shirt, a Yankee soot, split up the back,
A yeller tie, wif spots of red an’ bloo.
Me cuffs kept playin’ wif me nervous fears,
Me patent-leathers called fer pearly tears.
An’ there I sits wif: “Yes, mum. Thanks.
Indeed?”
Me stand-up collar sorin’ orf me ears.
“Life’s ’ard,” she ses. An’ then she brightens

“Still, we ’ave alius ’ad our bite an’ sup.

Willie! Oh. ’Ell! ’Ere wus a darnin’ pill!

There ain’t no sight in ’eaving ’arf so fine!
An’, as they looked at me, they seemed to

There was a sorter glimmer in ’er eye.

It’s wot they calls responsibility.
All of a ’cap that feelin’ come to me.
An’ wif it conic a ’omesick kind o’ thing—

Sometliink to reckon wif in fueher strife.

An’ ’ere’s me tremblin’ on the' bloomin’
brink.
“’Er pore, dear par!” she ses. an’ gulps a

An’ then I tells ’er ’ow I got a job
As storeman down in Jones’s printin’ joint,
A decent sorter cop at sixty bob.
Then things gits ’omelike ; an’ we talks till

An’ tries to tease Doreen to fix the date.
An’ she grows suddin’ soft an’ tender-like.
An’ cries a bit when'we parts at the gate!
An’, when I’m mooehin’ ’omeward frum the
car
A dead crook-notion stops me wif a jar :
“Wot if Doreen,” I thinks, “should grow to
be
A fat ole weepin’ wilier, like ’er mar?”
Oh, strike! It won't bear thinkin' of! It’s

An’ I’m a mean, unfeelin’ dog to look
At things like that. Doreen’s Doreen to

I s’pose ’e smooged, an’ loved ’er in "is way,
An’ wed, an’ took ’is chances like a man.
Hut Gawd! This splicin’ racket ain’t all

Love is a gamble; an’ there ain’t no certs.
Some day, I s’pose, I’ll git wise to the skirts
An’ learn to take the bitter wif the sweet.. ..
But, strike me purple ! — “Willie.” That’s

The Seven Joys.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[ T was the Purple Room in the Palace.
The lofty stained-glass dome that
ceiliuged it glowed with rich purple,
deep almost to blackness, and, although the
light that filtered down through it was
thinner in coloring, it filled the room with
a flush so that the air itself appeared
luminous. Yet from the absence of the
midge-movement one sees in sunlight, the
very air seemed dead. The silent, staring
walls of grey marble heightened this effect
of quiescence ; so, too, did the oaken plank-
ing of the floor, whose darkness of age was
made wealthier by the uncanny purple that
seemed to rest rather than shine upon it.
In the centre of the room was a huge bed,
over which was spread a coverlet of silvern
silk, wrought in purple thread with bar-
baric embroiderings. Supporting the bed
at its four corners were fearful bronze
dragons, crouched as if ready to spring, and
with an expression of concentrated malice
in their glittering, jewelled eyes. Indeed,
they seemed as live things transformed into
bronze at a moment of springing upon their
victim, with all the murder-will yet upon
them and their power of action merely sus-
pended.
But most startling of all in this silent
place were the Seven Joys, who stood
shoulder to shoulder, at the far end of the
room, mute and motionless, their callous,
unchanging gaze set directly before them,
straying neither to left nor right.
llow long the Purple Room had stayed
thus there was no telling. An Eternity of
Silence rather than Time seemed in posses-
sion here. Yet an atmosphere of expectancy
pervaded everything. The quiescence was
too rich in portent for perfect calm. It
was as though the Silence might itself
scream at any moment from the agony of
suspense.
Whether or not Her coming had any sig-
nificance could not be told. At least for a
while She did introduce §ome motion into
the stillness, but it was in eerie accord
with the Purple Silence. For a portiere in
the corner of the room swung open without
the slightest sound, a wan hand drew the
arras folds apart, and, with the merest
muffled press of naked feet on the oaken
planking and the faint rustle of silken gar-
ments.... She entered.
A face like Ilers could never be for-
gotten. It showed traces of the rarest
ethereal beauty, a beauty that might have
been either posthumous or antewital, but
could never have belonged to life. But
whilst the contours of beauty still hovered
in her looks, the skin, waxen in its white-
ness, was drawn closely though smoothly
over the bones of the face, producing an
effect of the strangest haggour. The
scrawny neck that showed above and the
bare feet that peeped below the black
robe She wore, had their terrible pallor
made more marked by its sable coloring.
It was only when Her eyes were looked into
that it could be seen why Her presence
made such a harmony with the Purple
Room. In their great pupils was that same
expectancy that was atmospheric in the
room itself. They seemed to rather smoulder
than shine; the lustre within them could be
felt as were they pregnant with a dire light.
With slow, measured step She glided
towards the Seven Joys, standing mute and
motionless at the bed end. and. turning on
Her heels, faced the portiere through which
She had just entered. Then She leaned
eagerly forward and listened with fearful
intentness for some expected happening.
The hush was terrible as She waited thus
—a dead ; disastrous silentness that, com-
pared to it a heart beat would have been as
thunder and as a tempest gust the sound of
breathing. But no heart beat and no lips
breathed in this silent place.
The Seven Joys stood mute and motion-
less !
After a space—of what duration was no
telling, for every second seemed eternal here
—a wondrous smile, infinitely cruel in its
prescience, came upon Her face. Her arms
sank- to Her sides, and slowly lifting Her-
self from Her leaning posture She stood
erect. Her head flung slightly backwards,
but Her eyes still fixed upon the arrassed
portiere.
The Seven Joys remained mute and
motionless!
Now for the first time was heard a defi-
nite sound, as of hesitant footsteps passing
along a distant corridor, there rushing in
eager approach, here suddenly stilled. It
seemed that, the cruelty of Her smile in-
creased with every nighing of this sound,
for now it expressed perfect surety. The
air quivered a moment as if from expectant
hope.
At length the arras by the portiere was
again drawn apart, and He stood at the
entrance, looking frightenedly round the
room. With all his rude vigor of perfect
health, his rich energy of physical youth,
there was blended a feverish lusting. It
flamed from his eyes, it trembled in his
limbs as. seeing Her before him. lie walked
towards Her as one torn between Love and
Fear, walked as one somnambulous and
distraught.
The Seven .Toys remained mute and
motionless !
He halted a few steps from Her. that
terrible smile still upon Her lips, that war-
ring Fear aud Love si ill a t travail within
him. He spoke: “Who are you. what are
you, that you have lured me to follow you

DANGER!
BacKache, Rheumatic Twinges, Aching Limbs, Urinary Troubles, Gravel, Nervous
Depression point to Kidney WeaKness and may lead to serious complications if neglected.
For the over-worked house-
wife and tired-out man I)dan’s
Backache Kidney Pills are a
blessing. They quickly heal
and regulate the kidneys,
helping them to filter from
the blood the poisons and
impurities which all too often
cause disease. Their good
effect is often felt immediately,
and a fresh and invigorated
action of the kidneys brings
back to men and women the
strength their work demands.
D oan’s Pills do not act on
the bowels. They do one
thing —they cleanse and heal
the kidneys, and they do that
well. They are equally good
for men and women, and a
safe medicine for children.

CURED TO STAY CURED,
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
PYRMONT.
Mr. William Carroll, Sen., ex-railway guard, 7-10
Harris Street, Pyrmont, says'“Some time ago I
strained myself pushing some heavy trucks, and
soon noticed the effect in the small of my
back. For three solid months 1 was unable to work.
I was laid up. 1 had a very lame back, and a dull
pain through the loins and the kidneys, and my secre-
tions became unnatural and irregular. I consulted a
doctor, who recommended Turkish Baths, but though
I got a little ease I could not work. I used Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills and obtained wonderful relief.
1 am so much better 1 can now do heavy work. I am
firmly convinced that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
are a true kidney remedy, and I never 'fail to recom-
mend them among my friends.”
Fifteen years later Mr. Carroll confirms the
above. “I have been quite free of backache and urinary
trouble ever since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cure.d
me fifteen years ago. My cure proves that .Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills are a thoroughly good remedy.”
MANLY.
Mrs. E. Thompson, 194 Pittwater Road, Manly,
.Sydney says:—“For years 1 suffered agony from back-
ache and lumbago. I was so bad that I could scarcely
get about, and always felt tired, languid and depressed.
Other symptoms, which clearly showed my kidneys
were very much out of order, were, headaches, dizzi-
ness and irregular secretions. I tried many different
remedies, which were supposed to cure kidney trouble,
but derived no benefit from them. At last I decided
to try Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and only wish I
had got them long before ; they would have saved me
a lot of pain. After taking a couple of bottles. I felt
ever so much better, so 1 continued using the Pills
until I was quite cured. Considering how very ill 1
was, I think it marvellous that Doan’s Backache
Kidney Bills have cured me so thoroughly. Dis eight
years since I was cured, and I have been well ever
since:” ‘ .'
Mrs. Thompson confirms the above, two years
later —“I am still well, and have had no return of
backache and lumbago since Doan’s Kidney Pills
cured me 10 years ago.” \ !.

hereV I liate you, do you know that: I
hate you as I hate a Thing of Hell! ’
She made no answer, still smiling that
terrible smile.
lie took another"'step forward—he was
almost frantic now. “You beautiful dead
thing, does not my hate move you. Then I
tell you my love shall, for I must make you
mine ! You must be mine !”
With all his frenzy, how sullen- and
still was the tenuous -purple air, how blaz-
ing with menace were the dragons’ jewelled
eyes, how fearful too with portent was the
Purple Room.
And the Seven Joys remained mute and
motionless!
Now he had hurled himself upon Her in
an agony of abandon. His ravenous lips
were storming kisses upon Her face and
w-axen neck, his arms pinioned Her to him
in a baresark of desire. And 10, a faint
sigh escaped from Her lips, a Hush of color
teased Her whited skin and Her bosom, in
its rise and fall, pulsed the purple air into
visible waves.
But his face was pale now, and a tremble
was in his limbs as he held Her at arms’
length from him, gazing at those eyes that
now gloated on his with so fearful bright-
ness, those lips that now leaned towards
him in suppliance for his own. Her
beauty, too —was it indeed a thing of earth !
Perhaps he wondered so too, for he gave
a quick glance to either side as though seek-
ing a way of escape. On one side only the
grey marble walls, on the other the Seven
Joys, standing mute and motionless. There
was no escape!
But with much of his life run out and
his strength sapped from him. again he
turned to Her victress lips. Yet now was
She the assailant; now it was She clutched
him to Her and rioted her kisses on his
blanching skin, Her breath purring in long-
drawn inhalations, his answering in quick,
sudden jets.
A moment, but just for a moment, a rush
of strength came upon him. and hurling Her
away he gasped, “You ghoul!” She made
no response but to press him again to Her
bosom, devouring with ardent kisses the lips
that no longer had power to repel Her own.
The Seven Joys remained mute and
motionless !
Such beauty as now was Hers was never
seen on earth ; never before was witness to
such glory as triumphed in Her eyes as, -
holding him. limp and haggard in Her per-
fect arms, She gazed upon him breathing his
last gasping breath.
The Seven Joys remained mute and
motionless!
Quietly She carried him to the bed and
laid him, dead, upon its silvern coverlet.
And never word She said as, with slow,
exultant tread. She walked in Her fatal
loveliness from out the Purple Room.
No longer were the Seven Joys mute and
motionless. With measured step they
marched them to the bedside, and. shrouding
him in the silvern coverlet, wrought in
purple thread with barbaric embroiderings,
bore him also, shoulderwise, from out the
Purple Room.
BERNARD INGLEBY.
Malone’s Adventure with a Dog.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ TT \ J AS a man name iv Malone kim t’
V V live be Cochrane’s ’tis a year may-
be,” said McEvoy. “’N a qua re
man wid bis notions was Malone. ’Twouldn’t
do him t’ slape be the house at all, the same
bein’ bad fer the pulmonary ’n’ ailments iv
the chest, ’n’ di’fram ’n’ parts adjacent, him-
silf was tellin’ me, though as tine a strong
man ez you’d wish t’ see heftin’ logs was
the same Timothy Malone. That bein’
Misther Malone tuck ’n’ put his mathress on
the verandy flure, ’n’ so he slep thim nights,
wid the mossgeeties ’n’ the buzzin’ cats
tumblin’ adjacent ’n’ promiskewiss.
“Well, that was all right, mind yeh, ’n’
I’m for sayin’ nothin’ again a man slapin’
ez it pleases God ’n’ his own ar-r-guments ’n’
proclivities, but wan night there kim a most
feerocious mistinderstandin’ wid two great
dogs in the front garden if the Malone afore-
said. Timmy knew nothin’ iv the dispute,
or where it sprung from. It jist dthropped
in on him forchewitous, ez you might say, ’n’
raged mightily wid a tirrific furvor on Mrs.
Malone’s fushies, ’n’ wall-flowers, ’n’ rhon-
necdondrums.
“ ‘Hist!’ sez Malone. ‘Shoo!’ sez he.
‘Gwan wid yeh!’ he sez. But ’tis a matter
iv no consequence at. all would yeh say
‘Hist!’ to a roarin’, rompin’ brindle bulldog
iv spirit ’n’ pedigree whin he have a tidy bit
iv a cowhound be the troat, ’n’ is amusin’
his leisure wrestlin’ the same over the cab-
bage bed, ’n’ the pansy flowers, ’n’ other
commodities.
“ ‘Hist!’ sez Malone, but the sounds iv
inurther ’n’ divilment, accompanied wid
oprobrious langwidge wint on, ’n’ the riot-
chus animals, locked in an affectionit im-
brace, bumped the lince, ’n’ recoiled agin the
tank, ’n’ collided wid the house, ’n’ bom-
barded on the verandy, where they rolled ’n’
tumbled most precarious, lightin’ two regula-
tion rounds on the chist if poor Timothy
Malone.
“‘Hist!’ sez Malone, ’n’ the great fight
progressed t’ the chicken coop, ’n’ wrecked
the woodshed, a trimulous structure of Tim’s
own conthrivin’.
“Be this time the cattle dog kem t’ the
conclusion he was bate intoirely, his troat
bein’ bit clane in halves, ’n’ him bein’ dead
these three minutes T more, so he dropped
out iv the polemical dishputation wanst ’n’
for all. The bulldog, bein’ a bundle iv
Irish distraction, was bitterly dissapint wid
the other fer not makin’ a satisfactory bit
iv a barney, ’n’ lookin’ round for further
means iv maltin’ a night iv it, he rimimbers
Malone. ’Twas recalled to him Malone had
nnjul.v interfered in the racent confabula-
tion, ’n’ now he resented thim uncalled-for
remarks, ’n’ he wint fer Malone.
“Yeh niver had a brindle bull of wan
hunthred pounds burden get at yell desprit
when you was war-r-ni abed, sir, maybe .'
Yell niver did. No matter, bein’ a gintlemau
iv idueation, wid discernmint ’u’ imagina-
tion 'n’ intellectual faculties, ye’ll appreci-
ate the quandary iv Malone ’n’ his predica-
mints ’n’ mental oneasiness, will yeh?
“Malone was oiicommon alert be this time,
’n’ whin the dog bounded on his cintre piece,
driviu’ the wind out iv his body, like you’d
squeeze a blown bladder, Timmy prepared fer
divarsions. He perceived wid great alertness
’twas sufficient for the moment t’ keep him-
silf inside the beddin’. ’Twas ivident to a
keen mind that anny limbs stbrayin’ beyond
the blankets ’n’. the rug would be in immejit
’n’ imminint danger iv bein’ chewed off. So
Malone made a ball iv himself wid the bed-
din’, ’n’ he lave the dog to its fightin’.
“This wint on fer some considerable
moments, Malone’s blankets bein’ piteously
ayten betwixt ’n’ becliune, ’n’ Malone’s plain-
tive intirruptiou iv the chorus bein’ lost wid
the rugs ’n’ things mufflin’ n’ stiflin’ the head
iv him. Whin it seemed like enough the
rampagis dog would be aytin his way claim
through to Malone, Timothy changes his tic-
tacks.
“Sez Tim, ‘l’ll be better ’n’ more fortun.it
on top iv the dog, maybe.’ So wid a most
adthroit movement Timmy revarsed the situa-
tion, himself revolvin’, bringin’ the dog
under, wid all the beddin’ t’ bind him ’n’
hobble his inthoosiasm, divil doubt it. Now
Malone has the voracious ’n’ most timpis-
tuous ’n’ ungovernable dog fairly down, ’n’
he wastes no time in the makin’ iv a great
bundle of him. So yeh have Tim Malone
wid a great swag iv beddin’, inside iv which
is a convulsive ’n’ guttural bulldog, rightly
strugglin’ to be free, ’n’ ditarmined when
liberty ’n’ equality comes to him he’ll ate
the two logs off a man iv Malone’s height ’n’
complexion.
“What does Malone do in this ixtrimity?
Bein’ an Irishman ’n’ a man iv risource, he
grips the bundle, dog, ’n’ beddin’, ’n’ all, up
in his two arrms, ’n’ he shtarts out in his
thriflin’ shmall night habilimints t’ wander
all across Cochrane’s township, lookin’ fer
the rightful ’n’ risponsible owner iv wan
brindle bulldog weighin’ a negligible pound
’r so short iv tin stone.
“Malone kicked five minutes ’r more et
Brogan’s dure wid the heel iv his fut, V
whin Mi's. Brogan’s head shot through tin;
windy, ’n’ she cursed him onsparin’ fer a
wild, dthrinker ’n’ a dishturber iv the peace,-
sez Timmy:—
“ ‘Do you own anny kind iv a small wild
dog would eat a man, ma’am V’
“ ‘The divil a dog at all. Yeh roysthcrin’
bla’gard, go way home!’ sez the widdy
Brogan in one breath, ’n’ smashed down the
windy.
“Then Malone wint on to Teddy Burnc’s
house, ’n’ he kicked ’n’ made outcry most
impious ’n’ onseoml.v, ’n’. sez he:-
“‘Damyeh, d’yeh own a ruinous dbg
weighs wan hundthred weight wan quarter?’
“ ‘Go home t’ yer bed yeh ruffyin,’ sez
Teddy Burne. *’n’ don’t be breakin’ in on
the beauty sleep iv a sick man wid yer
onmannerly delirium.’
“So Timothy wint on wid his bundle to
Coleman’s, ’n’ to Blake’s, ’n’ Burke’s, ’n’
Cody’s’ ’a’ he kim to me, ’n’ meself, havin’ no
rayson at all to sispict ’n’ admire Dan Calla-
ghan, sthraiglitway took ’n’ directed Malone
t’ Dan’s house, ez that iv the on’y man fer
miles ownin’ wan obstropulnus bulldog iv
the weight ’n’ timperamint iv the wan men-
tioned.
“ ‘Yell see,’ sez Timothy t' me, ‘iv Ido be
rilasin’ him at all, he’s wan would turn on.
me, ’n’ tear me leg most audacious, so ’tis
imperitiff ’n’ necessary fer me that Ido lie
findin’ wan can overcome ’n’ contlirol him
whin lie’s rilaved iv the pressure iv biddin.’
“There’s nothin’ dishputable about Tim’s
attitude at all, ’n’ I’m accompanyin’ him t’
Dan Callaghan’s front dure, where he kicks
10 minutes be the clock afore Dan appears
in a short shirt ’n’ a dirty humor.
“Sez Timmy: ‘D’yeli-own a dog?’
“ ‘I do,’ sez Dan.
“ ‘A great, fee-rocious, ondisciplined, in-
human brute, is it, weighs a ton, ’n’ would
gnaw the shins off a man?’
“ ‘The same,’ Callaghan admits grudgingly,
’n’ wid a sly eye out fer throuble ’n’ suits of
damages.
“ ‘Then,’ sez Timmy, ‘it’s here I have him
in me two arrms, ’n’ I’d wish you t’ take the
baste into proper ’n’ lagel contlirol ’n’ man-
agement when I dthrop him, me boldin’, you
aforesaid liable for all damages before a
witness.’
“ ‘Dthrop him,’ sez Dan, standin’ ready.
“Malone dthropped him. ’n’ the dog fell
like a great dollop iv dough t’ the flure, ’n’
there he lay widout movement ’r remark.
“‘He’s dead!’ yells Callaghan.
“ ‘ls he, then?’ sez Malone.
“He was dead enough fer annything, him
havin’ been choked iv his breath in the
biddin’ all this time.
“ ‘You damn scamp, have yeh killed me
fine, great dog?’ wails Callaghan.
“ ‘N’ iv I have ’tis a good ’n’ noble thing,’
sez Malone; ‘’n’ he’ll come in handy.’ ’N’
wid that Timothy catches up the dead dog
be his two hind legs, ’n’ whirlin’ him he
swings a swoop that takes Dan in that place
where his vest would be, ’n’ Dan goes down
two double. He’s up agin full iv fight, but
wanst more he’s batted onmerciful wid the
dead dog, ’n’ down goes Callaghan. Now
Timmy, wid his blood up, shtarts troo the
house, armed wid his dead dog, ’n’ he swipes
the front furniture, ’n’ he swipes the kitchen
crockery, ’n’ when Mrs. Dan comes runnjn’
’n’ wailin’ wid the fear iv all the tin divils
upon her, he swipes her wan to go on wid,
at which, widout further remark T premedi-
tation, she topples back to the bedroom, ’n’
falls under the bed.
“Dan is now up on the heels iv him, wid
a tidy bit iv a table-leg to his fist, but be-
fure he arrives widin earshot Timothy
swings the dog most heroic, ’n’ lets go, ’n’ the
deceased takes poor Dan Callaghan fair cross
the neck, knockin’ his Adam’s apple clane
in on him, ’n’ outin’ him completely fer a
matter iv minutes, ’n’ sez Tim Malone :
“ ‘There,’ sez he, ‘ ’twill teach you, maybe,
not t’ befrind ’n’ harbor a roarin’ big dog
would bite people in their beds.’
“Then Timothy Malone tuck up his bed ’n*
walked.”

The importance of efficient insulation, in many cases, is not realised. Great
care is shown in the selection of a steam plant to ensure the greatest economy,
yet the insulation which is of equal importance is in many cases partly neg-
lected. If you strive to make a saving in the steam consumption of your
engine, why not make certain that it is not wasted again through faulty in-
sulation ? The claims we make as to the exceptional efficiency of Newall’s
Coverings are fully borne out by actual test, and, further, by the enormous
sales, including repeat orders, and we do not know of a single instance where
any other covering has been used once Newall’s have been tried.
The Ultimo and White Bay Power Houses are insulated throughout with
Newall’s Coverings, and this material has also been adopted exclusively by the
N.S.W. and Victorian Governments. These are facts which will tend to fur-
ther prove our claims. The innumerable advantages of this material over all.
other forms of lagging are described in interesting booklet, which we will be
pleased to mail you along with samples.
