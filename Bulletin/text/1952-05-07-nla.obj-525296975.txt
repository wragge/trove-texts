MOOR PARK WHERE MONMOUTH PLANNED TO TAKE THE THRONE
MOOR PARK, now a celebrated golf course within easy reach of London,
was in ancient times the property of St. Alban’s Abbey, from which it
was severed during the contentions between the rival houses of York and
Lancaster.
The original house, nearly on the same site as the present one, is stated
to have been built by George Neville, Archbishop of York. Edward IV
promised to visit the Prelate here on one occasion, and while arrangements
were being made for the Royal visit the Archbishop was removed to Windsor
and arrested for high treason. The king then seized Moor Park, with all its
rich furnishings and plate to the value of £20,000. At that time the mansion
was constructed of brick, in a square court, entered by a gatehouse with a
tower and surrounded with a moat.
Henry VII granted the estate to John de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who led
his army at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. In later years it again
reverted to the Crown, and was for some time in the possession of Cardinal
Wolsey. At the time of the Restoration Moor Park was purchased by Sir
John Franklyn and sold to Thomas, Earl of Ossory, son of the Duke of
Ormond. Later it was purchased by the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth.
His widow, Anne, only daughter of Francis, Earl of Buceleuch, is said to
have ordered all the tree tops in the park to be cut off immediately on being
informed of the decapitation of her husband; this tradition is thought to be
strengthened by the present day condition of many of the oaks in the park,
which are decayed from their tops.
The Duchess of Monmouth sold the estate to H. H. Styles, who had
made a great fortune from the famous South Sea Bubble. The present
mansion is stated to have been built by the Duke of Monmouth, but it was
cased with Portland stone at a cost of £150,000 by Styles, who also added
the magnificent Corinthian portico.

Penguin Dostoievsky.
The Red Page
Most important in the current batch
of Penguin reprints is Crime and Punish-
ment by Dostoievsky, in a new transla-
tion by David Magarshack.
Mr. Magarshack has used much collo-
quial and slang English, but the new trans-
lation has on the whole much the same
characteristics as the old ones, inasmuch
as the one part of the long narrative that
doesn’t live is the one that Dostoievsky
tried to make live most —namely, the
murder of the old woman by the hero
Raskolnikov.
Everything else in the story lives but
the part where Raskolnikov creeps into
the old pawnbroker’s flat and kills her
and then her sister with a hatchet is
invented. You don’t feel it as you feel
Raskolnikov’s interview with the police-
inspector, the conflict between his social
conscience and his inordinate ambition
and the rationalisations of his motives—
always wanting to do good and having
nothing to do good with.
The reason for this is made clear in
the preface. Dostoievsky is Raskolnikov.
He is talking about himself, about his
own experiences, not somebody else’s. He
himself was tried for a crime or an alleged
crime—he had read an open letter at a
gathering of a literary circle in which
the Russian critic Belinsky attacked
Gogol for reactionary views in certain
essays. Present Russian official circles
would probably regard it, not as a crime,
but as a heroic gesture.
It isn’t to be supposed that the Tsarist
Government wanted to give this obscure
young intellectual the conditions for
becoming a great writer. If it had wanted
to do that it would have offered him a
scholarship or a literary fellowship or
something and probably have ruined him
as a writer. Instead, it gave him four
years’ hard labor in a Siberian prison
where he mixed with murderers, horse-
thieves and malefactors. It isn’t to be
supposed that Dostoievsky wanted to go
to prison, either, or that he thought that
the Tsar was doing him a great service;
but, as he was the rare type of individual
who translates his unhappy feelings in
terms of thinking rather than in terms of
self-pity or blaming his conditions, he
made his incarceration in the jail and
the dreadful tyranny of his jailers into an
advantage, just as he did his epilepsy.
Most people would make their epilepsy
a sufficient excuse for not doing any-
thing, much less becoming a writer, but
Dostoievsky made his, horrible as it was,
into an advantage, and in his works are
to be found magnificent descriptions of
epilepsy. Most of his heroes, in fact,
are epileptics ; and in Crime and Punish-
ment are to be found some of the most
living descriptions in, literature of the
mental turmoil of the social outcast. But
as far as is known Dostoievsky never com-
mitted a murder, so the murder in Mr.
Magarshack’s translation of Crime and
Punishment is the least living part in a
very living story, despite the translator’s
efforts.
Other items in the Penguin series are
New Biology and Science News; English
Society in the Early Middle Ages, an
absorbing description by Doris Mary
Stenton of England in the two-and-a-half
centuries after the Norman Conquest,
drawn largely from contemporary
sources ; a charming children’s book, The
Secret Garden, by F. Hodgson-Bumett;
The Crown Jewels, a book of plates of
the Royal regalia; the whole of Mendels-
sohn’s Violin Concerto in E Minor and
two overtures of Mozart —“The Magic
Flute” and “Don Giovanni”; British
Butterflies; and a couple of mystery
or murder stories. The Taming of the
Shrew is added to the excellent Shak-
spearc series.
F. S.
FINE AUSTRALIAN NOVEL.
After what seems a considerable gap
in Australian writing, with many good
documentary books published but few
creative works of any real distinction, it
is a great pleasure to come upon T. A. G.
Hungerford’s The Ridge and the River
(Angus and Robertson); a novel in which
there is nothing to criticise, everything to
admire, and which is substantial enough
to fill up with its own weight and energy
any gap there may have been.
Apart from its literary significance the
novel does in fact fill a gap in the general
picture of contemporary Australian life
as it has been set down by novelists,
historians or journalists: for The Ridge
and the River is by far the most vivid and
powerful story yet published about the
Australian troops fighting in the islands
to the north. It does for Bougainville or
New Guinea what Lawson Glassop’s We
Were the Rats did for Tobruk, and what
John Fountain’s short-stories (not yet in
book form) have done for Greece and
the p.-0.-w, camps of Yugoslavia. It is
as authentic as Rohan Rivett’s Behind
Bamboo —Hungerford fought in the
islands with the 2/8 Australian Com-
mando Squadron—and has, besides, all
the special advantages of drama and
characterisation proper to a work of
fiction.
The high peak of the novel is in three
or four chapters at the centre when the
small group of Australian soldiers —a
“section” —on whom the story focuses
gets to grips with the Japanese. Here
the writing is not merely good but excel-
lent ; perhaps enough, with the other
admirable qualities of the book, to give
The Ridge and the River enduring life as
the representative Australian war-novel of
the island campaigns. These are the
chapters, making a truly superb sequence
of drama and suspense, that begin when
Lieutenant Wilder decides rashly to
attack the Japanese camp at dusk instead
of the usual time of dawn; when Shear-
wood and his guide Womai, watching the
camp in broad daylight from a thicket of
wild bananas, see two Japanese with long
bush-knives coming closer and closer to
their hiding-place; when Malise and
Evans, on an unofficial reconnaissance,
see other Japanese bathing in the river
and then suddenly, without warning, are
fired on.
The whole set of incidents here, when
the jungle for once is brilliant with sun-
light, glittefs with great moments of
excitement. There is the moment when
Malise, hard, bitter and relentless, the
part-aborigine who hates his own fellow-
soldiers probably much more than he
hates the Japanese, is about to fire on a
Japanese bather who is doing acrobatics
on the river-bank—a shot which would
probably mean the death of Shearwood
and Womai, as well as wrecking the
whole plan of attack. There is the
moment, just before hp pushes Malise’s
rifle down and prevents the shooting,
when the tough Pinkie Evans realises,
incredulously, watching the enemy at
play in the water, that the Japanese are
human.
There is Malise badly wounded in the
sudden burst of fire from the jungle and
Pinkie more lightly wounded in the arm.
There is the eerie suspense as Shearwood
and Womai, close to the Japanese camp
in their banana thicket, and Lieutenant
Wilder and the rest of the men a little
further back on the ridge, ponder the
meaning of those two shots cracking the
stillness of the afternoon. There are the
two Japanese who have fired the shots
crossing the river to examine their
victims ; and the wounded Pinkie waiting
in dazed ferocity for the right moment to
hurl his grenade. There is the rescue of
the wounded Australians under a cascade
of fire from across the river as other
Japanese come up ; there is the slaughter
in the river and the beginning of the
long trek home.
There is never the slightest confusion
in the description of these scenes in the
jungle. There is never any falsifying of
emotion. Nothing is “jazzed-up” as
action is in so many war-books; nor is
the action slowed down by too much
meditation. There is time to see the
clearing, the jungle, the river ; time to
know exactly what each man thinks and
feels ; but the pace is swift and clean,
the excitement never falters. The
dialogue is terse, strong, earthy but
natural; not coarse fqr the sake of
coarseness nor whipped-up into a literary
artifice, like so much of the dialogue of
Hemingway and his followers. The
descriptive writing is direct, vigorous,
simple, visualising the action with the
economy, the clarity and the dramatic
intensity which can give even to the most
appalling scenes of carnage a kind of
savage beauty;—
Only the cooling air told him that it was
getting late. The stabbing of his wound
and the jerking figures of the Japanese filled
his consciousness to the exclusion of every-
thing else.
They were in the shallow water now, the
pair of them. Now he could see all of their
drab puttees, now one of them stood on
the hard beach, and the faint squelch Of
his black canvas boots reached the Aus-
tralian’s ears as from miles away. Now
they both began to walk towards the
gravelly rise, peering round like brute
beasts, flat brown faces, squat bowed legs,
brown hands steady on the rifles across
their chests. Now . . , Now!
A second later the vicious, ugly
crump of the grenade shattered the silence
into a million fragments and strewed them
amongst the trees, up and down the gully.
Fighting a red haze that danced before his
eyes, Evans raised his head and peered
drunkenly to the river-bank.
One of the Japanese lay sprawled on the
coarse sand at the foot of the slope,
twitching spasmodically and arching his
back like a sick dog. The other walked
diagonally back to the river, mechanically,
blindly, his mouth opened hideously in a
soundless scream. Blood bubbled over his
hands where he held them clasped across
his belly; when he was a few feet from the
water, a scarlet stream belched from his
gaping mouth and he fell forward so that
his black cropped head was submerged, and
a sinuous banner of scarlet drifted away
from him, slowly and even beautifully, in
the clear green water, until it was snatched
and torn to shreds by the swift current
further off-shore.
Earlier that same afternoon Evans had
been frightened to realise that the Japanese
were people, that they could be hurt, and
that what ran from their wounds was blood,
not sawdust. Now that was forgotten. The
soldier took over from the man. He
laughed harshly and raised his Owen to
the crook of his arm, pressing it against
his elbow for support. “And here’s one
for his nob, you bastards!” he croaked,
pulling the trigger. The body at the water’s
edge shook again in a tr’avesty of life
under the impact of the thudding slugs, and
the roar of the weapon shuddered up and
down the gully, and out over the undulat-
ing woolly plain of the tree-tops.
Then, as if these tremendous scenes of
violence in tranquillity, death in the sun-
light, were not enough in themselves to
make any novel memorable, there follows
for full measure the drama of the long
trek back to the precarious refuge of the
foxholes on Tononoi Ridge, where the
Australian outpost is; Malise un-
conscious on his stretcher. Pinkie
struggling on as best he can, the men
practically naked because they have given
their clothes to keep Malise warm; night
and the jungle all round them, rain fail-
ing heavily, their boots clogging and
sliding in mud; and, because the
Japanese are lying in ambush on the main
track, a new route home to be found
through the dense bush lit with phos-
phorescent fungi, over the monstrous
ridges and across the swift dark rivers.
It is a sequence declining in intensity
of suspense after the drama of battle —
when Lieutenant Wilder and the Bren-
gunner Wallace clean up twenty Japanese
who have got on their trail it seems
almost a triviality by now ; a detail of
jungle life, like the moment when some-
body encounters a stinging-tree—but
taking on a new, slower intensity as the
battle of men against the jungle. The
climax comes when Pinkie, who has
struggled so long towards safety, is swept
to his death while crossing one of the
rivers: another unforgettable scene, the
profound pathos of which is at once re-
lieved and deepened by the novelist’s
resolute and soldierly attitude towards
death:
He hung there for a moment, until a
swirl of the current swept him round the
side of the rock and out of sight. The
wet surface, glistening, evilly in die golden
light, was bare... .They stood on the rocky
little beach, overwhelmed by the hammering
suddenness of Evans’s death, each man an
indistinct shadow palely gilded by the blue
starlight, until Shearwood lifted his head
wearily and looked around him Their
pale bodies shone strangely through the
thin darkness, cleansed of the filth of the
trek through the jungle. Shearwood looked
down almost wonderingly at his own white
limbs, his exhausted mind refusing to
grapple with the strange truth that he stood
almost naked on a strip of rocky ground
beside the alien river that had just claimed
the life of his friend The next day, and
the day after, it would come back in agonis-
ing clarity, but by then they would be able
to cope with it, and throw it off. It would
become in retrospect just another patrol,
remembered if at all above others only
for humor and excitement.
The tragedy would fade out of it —
Pinkie Evans, once they became used to his
absence, would be forgotten, not because
they were callous or because they wanted to
forget him, but because so many things
would crowd in to take his place, and
because in remembering him they would not
be able to forget that what had happened
to him could happen to any one of them.
White’s last desperate effort to hold Pinkie
had strained the muscles of his arm ; before
they healed White would have forgotten
what had hurt them.
In the form The Ridge and the River
is like Conrad’s Nigger of the Narcissus ;
what is called the coate, somewhere
between a long short-story and a short
novel. It is a form which, allowing a
fuller development of a group of
characters than the short-story without
flooding out into the broader patterns
and weightier mass of the novel, makes
for a beautiful singleness of theme and
impact. The “plot” of The Ridge and
the River is simply the story of one
patrol. Lieutenant Wilder, newly posted
to the section at Tononoi Ridge, has
arrived in a state of panic, having been
ambushed on the way. He is sent out on
patrol at once to give him a chance of
redeeming himself; goes out, does well,
and brings all his men except Pinkie safe
home; the arrival coinciding with the
news of the dropping of the bomb on
Hiroshima and the possible ending of the
war.
It is one patrol; and with its admirable
portraits of men and officers, its perfect
understanding of the soldier outlook, its
humor and its toughness, its pathos and
its courage, its nights of rain and slush
and its days of sudden violence —“Always
on the ragged edges of the light there
waited the tiger day, ready to spring”—
it is an epitome of all the fighting in
the islands around New Guinea. When
you have read this novel you know
exactly what it was really like up there ;
a grim story of savagery and endurance,
lit with a wary but profound pride in the
men who fought in the jungle, with a
kind of hard compassion, and with the
clear light of complete sincerity.

THE COAL.
In the time when swan and swan
down the grey half light were gone,
through fire-blackened scrub he came
where in resurrected flame
the waratah rose from its steep
above the sounding of the deep.
There, in that rock-bare region made
cold by rain, he stood and prayed
that the poet’s coal of pain
burn and brand his brow again.
In the time when swan and swan
with their creaking cries were gone,
sudden all the ashened west
burst and seared his face and breast;
round him rock and scrub on fire
stood out fused in one desire,
where the fierce flower from its steep
flamed upon the sounding deep.

ROLAND E. ROBINSON.
Reviewed Briefly.
The Sacred State of Akan (Faber) is a
tome in. which Mrs, Eva L. R. Meyero-
witz revels in the complexities and techni-
calities of State ceremonial and religion
among the Akan peoples of the Gold
Coast and particularly in the conventions
of the strange queen rule which
used to be the order of the day there.
To the ordinary reader the tome might
just as well, be written in the Akan
language, though no doubt an anthro-
pologist might regard it as other people
regard the works of Peter Cheyney. The
illustrations, however, are excellent.

Blackmail: Vera Chute (Museum
Press), A handsome young down-and-
out in Los Angeles is caught up into a
blackmail racket, and while he is living
on money filched from the blackmailers
his efforts to track them down run him
across the path of a young lady who is
trying to get her photograph (unadorned)
back from their files. The big moment
comes when, thinking kindly of the hero,
the beautiful girl decides to persuade him
that her head has been added to someone
eise’s nude body by a scoundrelly photo-
grapher. The photographed body has a
just-perceptible scar, and it occurs to the
ingenious girl that the young man might
believe his own eyes if he were enabled
to make a comparison. There is also a
visit to a deplorably low dive, and a hide-
out with a curious old musician in a new
suburban cottage—altogether, for this
kind of book, there is quite an effort to
Dc different.

Sylvester: Edward Hyams (Longmans).
This is about a young electrical engineer
who did well in the Navy in the last war,
and celebrated victory in Europe by
welding a perambulator and a pawn-
broker’s three golden balls to the mast of
the visiting destroyer of a foreign Power.
As pictured on the dust-cover, the design
thus formed looked reasonably enough
like some new form of secret weapon or
electrical equipment; and though none
of the Navy’s experts knew what it was,
all pretended to know all about it; it
received a code name, and gradually was
developed, by shrewd publicity, into a
threat to world peace and, finally, the
guarantor of world peace. The author
knows his Navy and also his Evelyn
Waugh ; his handling is gay and brilliant,
and at the same time there are some
scenes in an engineering workshop and,
especially, in a cheap restaurant where a
truckdriver gets chesty over having
bashed-up a traffic cop that have rea,
power.

"LABOR'S" WRECK.
Signs are not wanting that the “Labor”
party, as it has existed for 12 years under
the dictatorship of its N.S.W. juntas, is
breaking up. At present it resembles a
panicky, shipwrecked crew with not
enough boats, rafts or even lifebelts for
everyone. The only comfortable members
of the once-great party are a few fat
rats who have dived overboard ahead of
their vessel’s plunge and have secured
a footing on milk, coal, harbor and other
substantial boards unlikely to sink in
political tempests.
The little clusters of desperate politi-
cians, industrial and otherwise, struggling
to prevent themselves from sinking in the
cruel sea do not make a pretty picture.
Some of them, apparently abandoning all
hope, are loudly confessing the party’s
sins, as in the case of Dr. Burton, Dr.
Evatt’s bosun, shouting (through “Voice”)
that the Grand Old Organisation of the
Light on the Hill, outwardly so smug and
self-righteous, has in reality been addicted
to the most awful and secret vices, such
as “embracing Italian Fascism” and
admitting into its inmost soul the
“elements of totalitarianism, intolerance,
bigotry.”
Dr. Burton asks in a recent article:
“Whither n0w.... is there no alternative
to Communism and Fascism?”
But it is the operations of the industrial
groups which are most worth watching.
Everybody in “Labor” who values his
life is now beginning to court the leaders
of these secret-ballot commandos who are
throwing the Communists out of union-
leaderships and their enemies out of
A.L.P. office.
Four years ago Mr. Clarrie Martin,
Attorney-General of N. S. Wales, poured
scorn on the method by which the
industrial groups are rising to power. He
wrote, in the introduction of a pamphlet
issued by the N.S.W. Fabian Society:
Compulsory secret ballots in the trade-
unions have become an important political
issue in Australia. Demand for them has
come primarily from political interests
opposed to Eabor, including: the Press.
Their reasons are plain. They believe that
secret ballots will weaken the militant
■strength of the unions and reduce strikes.
He admitted that even then “Labor”
was divided about the suggested ballots.
Official political “Labor” was not. It
opposed their introduction boots and
all until a welling-up of public opinion
during the 1949 coal strike culminated in
the introduction of a private bill by Mr.
Menzies. The Chifley Government then
found itself compelled to beat a hurried
retreat and introduce a measure along
the lines pioneered by the Opposition ;
one designed to satisfy the public because
it provided for union secret ballots, but
equally palatable to the Communists
because it was unworkable.
“Labor” again fought noisily against
the amendments which the Menzies
Government introduced last year to
make these ballot provisions effective and
operable. But to fight against them today
has become suicidal, as numerous “Labor”
bosses have discovered.
Mr. Laurence Short and his cohorts are
hot on the trail of dissenters, pressing
the pursuit with vigor, though they reward
those who give support by giving them
credit they have not earned. At the out-
set, when some of the unions within reach
of the strong arm of the A.L.P. central
executive went to the Arbitration Court
to ask for a supervised ballot, they
found themselves opposed. The A.R.U.
moderates, for instance, applied for a
controlled ballot for the presidency of
the union, long held by Comrade J. J.
Brown, a member of the Communist-
party central executive and fresh home
from Moscow. Whereupon the Federal
executive of the A.R.U., of which
the senior vice-president was Mr. J. A.
Ferguson, also Federal president of
the A.L.P., took a large slice of
union funds and briefed counsel to
oppose the application. Also, when the
question of blotting out the industrial
groups was put forward at the South
Australian A.L.P. conference, Mr. Fer-
guson and Mr, Kennelly, M.L.C., Federal
A.L.P. secretary, were there to assist
in the execution.
Now it seems that the industrial groups
are doing the executing. They are heav-
ing the most powerful figures into the
cruel sea.
A valued organ of a large “independent
Socialist” group which includes Dr.
Evatt, Mr. Eddie Ward and a galaxy of
Labor intellectual contributors could still
write in December, 1951, that it was
“shortsighted” to “continue to devote the
entire energies of union organisation to
the task of ousting Communists,” thus
“sowing rifts of dissension within the
union in doing so.” It went on:
It is for this reason that AX.P. bodies
in 8. Australia, and until recently in
N. 8. Wales, looked with disfavor on their
unruly offspring: with its strong: sectarian
rather than political basis. It is worth
bearing: in mind that the amendments to
the Arbitration Act under which Short
made his application to the court were
strongly opposed by the Eabor party. The
N. 8. Wales Executive’s support for action
on the basis of these amendments therefore
appears anomalous. The non-political
foundation of the, nominally, industrial
groups is responsible for the alignment of
the party and the groups.
There is no uncertainty about the N. S.
Wales A.L.P. attitude today. It has every
flag of distress up, including its trousers,
and is using the megaphone to assure the
industrial comrades converging on it that
it is prepared to share the raft. Mr. E. G.
Wright, general secretary of the N. S.
Wales A.L.P., intones at the top of his
lungs:—
Eet there be no mistake: Eaurence Short
and his supporters have the full, unquali-
fied support of the A.E.P.
Wherever the eye rests on the “Labor”
scene a fight or an altercation is in pro-
gress. There was visible at the beginning
of April the struggling form of Mr.
Dougherty, general secretary of the
A.W.U., wrapped round like Laocoon
with those bent on strangling him. Above
the row was heard the voice of
the N. S. Wales executive branding him
as a “disruptionist,” “censuring” him and
assuring the rank-and-file of “Labor”
that “if any serious break occurs in
A.W.U. relations with the A.L.P. it is
because the N. S. Wales executive is not
for sale to anybody.”
Also there were visible the quarrelling
masses of the “A.1.M.” and/or “Voice”
groups, clustered round a journal which
was founded under the former name in
December last, which advertised that its
“finance comes from people in sympathy
with its objects,” and its literary contri-
butions from Dr. Evatt, Dr. Burton (the
endorsed candidate for Lowe), E. J. Ward,
Leslie Haylen, Allan Fraser, Kim Beazley,
P. J. Clarey, Frank Crean, J. A. Ferguson,
Clarrie Martin and others: strange com-
pany to be included in a firm de-
liberately formed, according to some of
its sponsors, to produce an “independent
Socialist” organ.
A violent quarrel at the outset, during
which one section of the sponsors pinched
the journal’s name from another set of
the sponsors and inducted a new set of
contributors —Dr. Lloyd Ross, ex-Colonel
Sheppard (a well-known speaker of the
Communist-party platform) and others—
enabled readers during four months to
see what the exposed body of Socialism
looks like through rents in its garments.
There was Professor Arndt, advocating
in December the very measures of import-
restriction for dealing with the recession
which his comrade Dr. Evatt condemned
loudly in March. There was a journal
which had the head of the Federal
Parliamentary “Labor” party advertised
as its leading contributor, and which
claimed to have been founded with the
“co-operation of the A.L.P.,” crying out
against the industrial groups, the A.L.P.’s
pride, for devoting all their energy to
ousting Communists. Dr. Evatt, leader
of the party, avowedly hating Commun-
ism, was seen writing of peace with
Japan, and alone of Western leaders
taking the same line as the
Communists —that the Australian
Government has “become a party to de-
cisions repudiating the existing Eleven
Power Agreement for a peace with Japan. ”
There was Dr. Lloyd Ross, than whom
Houdini was never more expert at coming
up on the right side, declaring that “the
weaknesses of Labor are general
the delay in working out a detailed demo-
cratic attitude to the Communist threat,
the failure to prepare plans against infla-
tion, on foreign policy and industrial
unrest, the tendency to strengthen the
bureaucratic control over the party and
to suppress criticism”: strong meat
coming from the erstwhile chief propa-
gandist of the Chifley Government, but
agreeing with the view of Dr. Burton, in
an opposing group.
Above all the recriminations, the
accusations of sectarianism, the abuse of
Left and Right and the plop of Fat Rats
reaching safety, not to mention the
choruses of joy from the Communist
party and from the evergreen J. T. Lang,
can be heard the second battle raging
round the A.C.T.U. Its affiliation with
the International Confederation of Free
Trade Unions, after breaking with Mr.
Ernie Thornton’s W.F.T.U., is subject to
the “odd twist” that “the biggest financial
contributors to the A.C.T.U. are the Left-
wing unions” and that “it will be their
money that will meet most of the affilia-
tion costs” payable to the new moderate
body. Also there is Mr. Ferguson warn-
ing the A.C.T.U. that if it does not cease
to align itself specifically with the Right-
wing a Communist-controlled union bloc,
which includes his own A.R.U., will take
over from it.
Lastly there is Dr. Evatt, one foot on
the wreck, one foot on the raft, leader
of the official “Labor” party but partici-
pant with Dr. Burton, Eddie Ward and
his more radical fellows in the operations
of an “independent Socialist group,”
hating the Communists but defending
their right to operate untrammelled, and
supporting their policy in the Pacific
against the Australian people’s policy. He
is cheered by the industrial-groupers of
Melbourne and hand-in-glove with the
“anti-sectarians” of Sydney—Bligh and
Christian at one and the same time, and
just as ready to sail for Pitcairn as for
Java ; in fact, in any direction that will
keep him in the leader’s job.
Dr. Burton was right when he wrote
in “Voice” last month that “Labor” is
“without clear practical policies or direc-
tion” and that, having been a “happy
hunting-ground for individual self-seekers
and for bigoted persons” with “particular
hobby-horses,” it has developed “a pre-
disposition towards disunity” and become
“an easy target for those who seek to
destroy it.”
Empty-Tub Thumping.
In the critical state of Australia’s
economic sickness the Loan Council
meeting of Treasurers might have been
expected to comport itself in businesslike
effort to make the visible loan-money
for public works go farthest, and in that
spirit to agree on priorities, in order to
bring essential works into reproductive
functioning in the shortest possible time.
Instead it offered to the electors an
exhibition of futile quarrelling about the
“refusal” by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment to drag money from the strato-
sphere for the States to spend in competi-
tion for materials which are not on hand
because of the lag in production.
The States went to the meeting to ask
for £351 million; they recognised the
absurdity of this by cutting it to £247
million, and even that sum they all, in
one form of words or another, admitted
to be out of reach. Nevertheless they
dug in on that figure, making themselves
ridiculous and even likely to injure their
own credit, and went away acknowledging
that all they cou'd safely budget on
was the practical estimate of the loan
market’s possibilities —some £5O million
—plus some £l3O million from Common-
wealth taxation, which was the ultmost
the Federal Treasury could offer.
During the now-closing financial year
the most strenuous appeals to investors
from Commonwealth and State Ministers
and other public men produced under
£63 million of new money for “security
loans” out of the £225 million which was
the lowest aggregate the six State Govern-
ments would consent last August to
accept for financing their public-works
programmes. The latest of these loans
proved conclusively that the money is not
to be had on the market, or, at least,
that the public will not respond without
increased incentive in interest-rate.
The State Treasurers refused then to
consider any higher rate of interest, and
avoided it last week. Financially speak-
ing, they presented themselves as a lot of
cripples under the arthritic effects of
inflation ; yet the only logical interpreta-
tion of their demeanor in the Loan
Council was that in order to serve their
political purposes the requisite “money”
—£3so million of it —ought to be
furnished by the Commonwealth Bank’s
printing-presses and inflation to be given
another good spurt.
When it is added that the two
chief spending Governments are under
“Labor” direction, that “Labor” policy
since 1949 has been devised chiefly
to the end of “preventing the Menzies
Government from governing,” and that
these two Governments —N.S.W. and Vic-
toria —must during this coming financial
year submit their fate to general elections
(requiring works expenditure in as many
constituencies as possible), their “policy”
at the Canberra meeting shows up in
all its shabby pretence.
The country has reached a stage where
everybody is feeling the pinch of inflation,
as was always to be expected; where the
rosy Socialist planning for a permanent
shortage of labor (called “full employ-
ment”) and a “Welfare State” run on
Government subsidies against anybody’s
ever getting hurt has collapsed with the
business of living on tick by Governments
and commercial business alike ; and where
there is no alternative to a regime of
hard work and plain living as a means
of halting a drift into an abyss in which
wages, however high, will be worth
nothing at all. The modern importance
of Australia as a producer of food and
basic materials is such as to warrant on
sight one expedient proposed, the raising
of new loan-money in Britain ; but defi-
nitely not if this community is unwilling
to make the effort required for its own
salvation. When, with Germany and
Japan coming back into international
markets, Australians demand on every
hand incentives to earn a decent living
or to finance enterprises of their own, the
need is as plain as daylight for a thorough
overhaul of our whole cockeyed economy,
the outcome of seemingly immovable
Government controls, restrictions, bans,
board-planning, subsidies and pressure-
group politics.
The steeply-graded income-tax has
reached a stage when it discourages
harder work in pursuit of higher incomes
and consequently saving and investment.
That is one thing the Loan Council
was up against. Another was that the
chief loan-spenders are the State Govern-
ments, whose bankrupt railway systems
are millstones around their necks and
whose budgeted expenditures are removed
beyond their control by perpetual
quarterly shoots upward of the basic-
wage. The most impenitent bankrupt of
them all. New South Wales, wants
annually more and more money from its
own or other Australian taxpayers in
order to subsidise its increasing railway
losses, both running-costs and deprecia-
tion funds.
High wages and the rising prices and
reduced services which result from them
find here their clearest illustration of
cause and effect. Of all the factors in
the aggravated post-war inflation which
was fastened on Australia by the Chifley
“Labor” Government of 1946-49 and its
fellow-traveller, the McGirr Government,
the outstanding worst has been the 40-
hour week’s debauchery of a fair day’s
work in return for “prosperity” wages,
as the state of the railways bears witness.
Incentive as a corollary to universal
controls is the fashion. What are to be
the incentives to provident citizens, as
the main source of taxes and savings for
support of more and more Government
works built and run under the spurious
40-hour week? Minister McEwen’s new
Federal food-production plans can have
no happy future, however plausible his
departmental blueprints, if the 40-hour
week is to govern them, too. The plain
fact is that production in essential indus-
tries is drying up under universal Govern-
ment controls and price-fixing which,
designed to assure output and stability
of marketing, have brought on only
shortages and the greatest instability in
Australian economic history. We are not
sure even that we shall be growing
enough food for ourselves a few years
hence, and the Government planners’ only
resort is to incentives to avert that
calamity, too.
So manifestly ruinous are the effects
of the 40-hour week that if the Govern-
ments cannot unite to tackle that evil
then they are quite unequal to applying
their “planning” energies to a revision
of the C-index wage-fixing futility. The
Menzies Government pleads that it can-
not interfere with the Arbitration Court
to cure the mistake of the 40-hour award,
and that industry must seek its own legal
remedies. But in the light of the methods
by which the award was created that plea
is one of avoidance. The Commonwealth
Government ought to demand that the
State Governments should join it, as a
means of combating their common
financial difficulties, in moving the Com-
monwealth Court to revise the standard-
hours of the working week, if only
because these Governments are the big-
gest employers in Australia. Under the
Socialist regime at Canberra they all
appeared before the court in 1947 to urge
the reduction of the working-week; the
McGirr Government in N.S.W. even
forced the court’s hand by legislating for
a reduction in prejudice of the hearing.
What they did then in pressing for a
relaxation which has knocked all then
Budgets silly they can quite as proper!}
do now in a concerted request to e
court to reverse the decision.
That would be a clear step to defeat
inflation. Without it there can be little
higher production in coal, steel or
transport services, no real check to ns g
prices and the cost of living, no salvation
from bankruptcy for State ral |^^ s ’
guarantee against ultimate high-w g
unemployment. If there is one experienced
politician in the land who does not
these things to be true, then he ought to
be thrown out of Parliament at t
elections as an incompetent blockneao.


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Liberals' Record.
Federal Parliament meets in an anxious
atmosphere, more Australians being en-
gaged in the age-old pastime of walloping
the joss than in pulling their weight to
help avert a mess. Everybody wants the
Government to “do something,” but no-
body is prepared to roll up his sleeves and
get stuck into it.
“Labor” wants full employment, but
only for a nominal, tired 40-hours a week
at wages consistent with wool at 377 d.
a pound instead of the actual current
average of about 137 d.
Nobody is willing to give up social-
service benefits, long-leave for everybody
or the right to loaf in the boss’s time.
Everybody wants to import motor-cars,
to buy refrigerators on tick. The States
want millions of loan money which they
know the Commonwealth has no chance
of borrowing.
So lef's put Menzies out. “If he went
to the country now he wouldn’t have a
hope.” Everybody has his own remedy
and will listen to no other.
The statement by Mr. Menzies of what
has been done in the past two years is,
however, encouraging. The forefront of
his programme was the defeat of Com-
munism in industry, and his Govern-
ment has provided unionists with the
machinery for ousting the Communists
from the unions, though the industrial
groups show a mean-spirited disposition
not to give credit where credit is due.
The Menzies Government’s national-
training scheme and the development of
the defences generally have worked some-
thing like a miracle to the sight of those
who have had a close view of what is
going on. Australia is stronger relatively
today than at any other period in peace-
time history. The Pacific Pact is some-
thing against which “Labor” rails, but it
was “Labor’s” own baby. The effects of
the anti-inflationary Budget have yet to
prove themselves fully, but evidence so
far is promising. No Government
planning can cure inflation without
national willingness to work, to increase
production, to make the laws of supply
and demand operate and agreement to the
whittling of the burdens of huge civil
services and of public works designed for
vote-buying and luxury industry.
But the Government has at any rate
simplified the taxation system so that tax-
payers can understand it and are trying
to make life livable for the primary pro-
ducer. Despite the cries of “Labor” that
a depression has been brought about,
homebuilding reached a peak last year,
unemployment an all-time “low” ; more
Australians, as Mr. Menzies says, own
motor-cars, refrigerators, telephones and
radio-sets than any group of people in
the world, possibly excepting the U.S.A.
A record of 17,000 war-service homes was
built last year, and savings-bank deposits
were on February 29 at the record of
£872,000,000 —an average of over £lOO
per person.
The expensive Commonwealth free
medical scheme is about to operate, and
the only question in reasonable minds
is whether, under the new world condi-
tions that are coming, the country can
stand the racket, especially with squander-
ing demagogues like Cahill, Gair, Mc-
Donald and Cain hanging round the tax-
payers’ necks.
The one point on which there is
real dissatisfaction in the Government
parties is the tendency of the Cabinet to
bow down to its advisers, some of whom
occupy their positions because of their
“Labor” political views. There is especial
dissatisfaction with the proposed expan-
sion of the trading activities of the Com-
monwealth Bank, using, of course, the
special deposits which are provided by
the trading banks as a basis of expan-
sion, and thus following a line of action
which “Labor” could well use to nation-
alise the trading banks out of existence
by unfair competition should it again
come into power.
Workers and Profits.
A fact which long ago should have been
obvious to union-leaders and “Labor”
politicians is never mentioned by them.
It is that unless industry makes profits—
and good profits—it cannot expand, let
ialone continue to employ its present
workers and pay them increasing wages.
Since the aforesaid union-leaders and
“Labor” politicians are always beefing
about more jobs and their alleged fears
of unemployment, their failure to acknow-
ledge the part that profits must play re-
veals either colossal ignorance or down-
right hypocrisy.
if it was confined to mere ignoring
the fact it would be bad enough. But
they go further. Their attitude to profits
hardly needs description. Everybody
knows that not only do the workers’
“leaders” decry profits and demand that
they be taken away from the persons or
firms which make them, either by taxation
or outright confiscation ; but they overtly
and covertly encourage workers not to
do too much on the ground that a man
“is a mug to work his guts out to make
somebody else rich.”
A mug! The real mug is the worker
who falls for this sort of poppycock. How
on earth can goods become cheaper, or
more factories be built, or more ships
come and go to provide work, or houses
be built, or schools, and all the rest of it,
without profits to finance it? If 100 men
are employed by a firm and they do no
more than they can be cajoled into
doing, how can that firm make plans to
employ 110 men? By the same token,
how can it employ another 10 men if its
profits are taken from it under the fat-
headed notion that profits are not good
for the firm, its employees or the nation
at large?
Development, expansion, employment,
increased population, more and cheaper
food, better homes for the workers,
better working conditions —all these
words and phrases are familiar to every-
one. They don’t mean a thing unless all
hands realise that unless industry makes
profits development and houses and more
food will be words and nothing else.
Americans, employers and politicians
and workers, realised it long ago. Which
is why the American worker makes more
real money in three months than his Aus-
tralian counterpart does in twelve.
Cheques, Lynch-low and
"Pig-swilling."
From the N.S.W. Liquor Commission’s
inquiry last week;
When the commission resumed after the
Anzac Day weekend James Joseph Lynch,
partner with C. J. Valentine in the Commodore
night-club, now defunct, who had earlier denied
he had taken any part in the club’s business,
was recalled and asked to explain certain
cheques of up to £5OO value drawn to “cash”
between August and November last year. He
could not remember details; some would be
loans to himself from the business, he said,
and some for running a ballroom he conducted
with his sister. One for £5OO had been to buy
a car: “You want cash when buying a car, to
get a good buy.” His “little black box” at
home to keep money in came into the picture
again; his sister would put money into it, too;
he would not know how much money was in
it, and had “not worried to count it recently.”
He could see no “mystery” in being unable
to account for “cash” cheques or any connec-
tion between them and contemporaneous large
amounts of liquor on his premises. He
explained to his taxation accountant, William
Clement Williams, week by week what the
cheques were for; Williams would make up the
taxation returns and he (Lynch) would vouch
for their accuracy. His returns would be
correct.
The Commissioner: I am satisfied they were
not. You may yet find that out.
Accountant Williams said Lynch’s answers to
his questions about “cash” cheques did not
entirely satisfy him. When he told Lynch he
ought to transact business by cheque direct,
Lynch said he liked dealing in cash.
A variation in the theme was supplied by
Dudley Marcus Bailey, ironworker and presi-
dent of a group of Blacktown residents who
said the group had imposed a ban on the
Robin Hood Inn, Blacktown, and demanded
dismissal of the licensee, manager for the
owners. The Commissioner interrupted the
examination to say this was taking the law into
their own hands, like “lynch-law,” and “as rank
a piece of impudence as I have come across.”
Counsel for owners of the hotel: Was
one of your committee a Mr. Doyle, who sold
“Tribunes”? —Yes,
Mr. E. G. Whitlam (assisting the Commis-
sioner): This is about distribution of beer, not
“Tribunes.”
The Commissioner; I admit the question; it
is very relevant. It shows what is behind this.
The Commissioner directed a transcript of
Bailey’s evidence to be sent to the Attorney-
General, which the Attorney-General later told
the Press was being considered.
Rev. Tomlinson (C. of E.), Northbridge said
he supported continuance of six-o’clock closing
“failing total prohibition.” He was once a
moderate dinker himself, but not now, He
defined a moderate drinker as “one who does
not spend so much of his income on liquor
that his family goes short.”
Mr. Smythe (for U.L.V.A.): You prefer the
6 p.m. rush to extended hours? —Yes.
The Commissioner: It has been called pig-
swilling?—That is an exaggeration.
Mr. Smythe : If an extension of hours would
moderate the pig-swilling you would favor it?
—No.
If the time in which the average man can
drink is limited he drinks more? —Yes.
Then you favor later closing?—No.
Several clergymen of other denominations also
opposed any change in hours.
Francis Wilson, formerly research-officer of
the Temperance Alliance, said the rush hours
in milk-bars were as bad as that in hotels.
Mr. Smythe : Do you say that your researches
have established that if a person has four
whiskies between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. it has
precisely the same effect on him as four
whiskies between 11 a.m. and noon? —Not
exactly the same.
But very nearly the same? —Yes.
Commissioner: Would you like to reconsider
that answer? —No.
Victor Edward Stanton, of the Temperance
Alliance, acknowledged that he had produced a
book, Facts, used for campaigning for 6 p.m.
closing at the 1946 referendum in N.S.W., and
admitted that certain statistical figures
published therein were misleading and that
he would have to abandon the argument based
on them.
The Commissioner said he had heard all the
evidence that he wanted, of the sort tendered,
on distribution of liquor, and that he wanted
to hear from “a source I don’t propose to
indicate” substantial evidence on hours of
drinking.
"By the Left——
From London: Easter, besides giving all
Britons a rest and pointing to brighter
days ahead, was also the first silly
season of conferences. And such tidings
as have sprung from speeches at three
conferences are considerably less inspir-
ing than pink blossom and longer days.
At Margate Britain’s sixth-largesl
union, that of Shop, Distributive and
Allied Workers, passed resolutions foi
wage-increases, now and evermore ; foi
an immediate general election; for -a
high-level discussion between the Powers
on “horror weapons”; for an investiga-
tion into alhged germ warfare in Korea ;
and for increased trade with Soviet Russia
and China, Another called for the abo-
lition of conscription, and delegates rep-
resenting 350,000 members deplored, with
virtual unanimity, the entire rearmament
programme.
At Glasgow, “Co-operators” called for
a Five-Power Peace Pact and were about
equally divided over rearmament. The
vote against rearmament was just lost by
357.000 votes. This means that, out of
7,000,000-odd “card”-votes, more than
3.300.000 were in favor of disarmament.
When it is borne in mind that British
Socialism is made up of three groups—
trade-unions, co-operative societies and
an amorphous mass of citizens —the
shift in power seems to point ominously
towards Mr. Bevan, with a hint of log-
rolling in the direction of the Kremlin.
What is more certain is that delegates and
holders of minor offices in the two in-
fluential groups will militantly oppose any
realistic or commonsense attitude to
national affairs, and that Mr. Attlee and
his “moderates” will estrange themselves
even to political self-immolation if they
dare to uphold the convictions that they
may be presumed to have.
At Battersea, the Communist party ex-
changed views in a fervor of mutual
admiration. Not much of what passed
emerges as fresh. A “new organisational
line, with a first emphasis on factories,”
was proclaimed. One delegate brightly
suggested a line-up with Mr. Bevan, but
this was immediately quashed from the
platform.
Mr. Bevan, whatever his other quali-
ties, had sinned beyond reclamation in
his admiration of Tito. Mr. Arthur
Horner, secretary of the National
Union of Mine Workers, was dropped
from the party’s executive committee after
having been a member since its inception.
On another note, all lovers of freedom
are deeply indebted to Mr. John Gollan,
the “Daily Worker’s” assistant editor, for
a direct exposition of the means whereby
the proletariat can attain dictatorship
without the proximity of the Red Army.
And all in the name of the people and
democracy. The police force would be
re-formed on “democratic” lines to be
responsible to the “people”; so would the
law and the judges; and so, too, would
the legislature. One always imagined
that Communist key-men were subtler
thap this.
The Menace of Car Thefts.
Mr. Clarrie Martin, the N.S.W.
Attorney-General, is either ignorant of
what goes on in the courts of his State
or is soft in the head. In the matter of
the increasing thefts of motor-vehicles
Mr. Martin is satisfied that the. law as it
stands is “adequate,” though judges,
motor-owners, motor organisations, insur-
ance companies, the police and pretty
well everybody else disagrees with him.
Even the motor thieves disagree, for they
continue to steal motor-vehicles at a
rate and with an effrontery which plainly
suggests that the law as it stands is no
deterrent.
Mr. Martin expressed his conviction of
the adequacy of the law' in a week during
which Judge Holden declared motor-
thievery to be a “grave menace” and
said that taking of cars would become
“infinitesimal” if offenders knew they
would have to face a judge instead of a
magistrate if caught; when the N.R.M.A.
repeated earlier demands for protection of
highly-taxed motorists; when the daily
average of stolen vehicles was increasing ;
and a morning newspaper published a
most extraordinary story of a man who,
seeing another at his car, spoke to him,
was threatened with violence, later
answered his door and found the same
man with three others, then found him-
self, his wife, his brother and his father
attacked by the four. “Later,” con-
cluded the report, “police charged a man
with illegally using a car and with
assault.”
All this, and more, Mr. Martin believes
to be adequately provided for by a law
which allows the offenders to elect to be
dealt with by a magistrate, who is pre-
cluded from imposing more than a fine
or 12 months’ jail.
“It is a long-established British tradi-
tion,” says this Mr. Martin, “that the
Bench should be untrammelled in arriv-
ing at its decision as to an appropriate
punishment.” True enough, but the
N.S.W. Bench is trammelled by an out-
of-date Act which is more of an incite-
ment than a deterrent to car thieves, and
magistrates ar;’, judges havq said so more
r than once. '
I Under die Act the police, if they charge
- the offender with theft of the car, must
. prove that he intended to steal the vehicle,
L though he may have had it a week and
, driven it a thousand miles before being
. caught. The very Government which
Mr. Martin adorns, in this same week,
decided to amend its Transport Act to
“put the onus” on anyone to prove that,
when caught without a bus, tram or train
ticket, he or she was travelling without
“intent to avoid payment.” Thus anyone
caught in a stolen car can demand that
the police prove intent to steal, whereas
anyone caught without a tram ticket has
to prove that he didn’t intend to steal.
Coral Sea.
“Ek Dum” on an anniversary:
The Coral Sea Battle celebration has become
an annual event, a sort of thanksgiving for
Australian-American co-operation, and it is
good that it should be so, even if this par-
ticular engagement is not necessarily the most
suitable for the purpose.
It is not good, however, that the occasion
should be regularly used, as it is, for dis-
seminating false history which grossly exag-
gerates the strategic importance of the tight and
belittles the part which Australian troops and
naval forces look in pushing the Japanese back.
Even Mr. Menzies says that the naval battle
“saved us from a probable Japanese invasion,”
though there was not in the squadron
which was turned back any element which
suggested an attempt at invasion of
Australia. In fact, General Eichelberger, who
commanded the Eighth Army in Japan during
the first two Occupation years, wrote in his
recently-published book that it was “not sur-
prising that Australians decided the next step
would be the invasion of their mainland,” but
that “documents captured at the end of the>
war, however, seem to indicate that an Aus-
tralian invasion was never part of the Japanese
plan; the aim instead was to separate Australia
and New Zealand and to cut the supply-line
from the United States.”
This accords with. General Blarney’s personal
view. The United States Navy’s report on
Pacific combat operations merely says of the
objective that “enemy forces had become suffi-
ciently consolidated in the Bismarck-New
Guinea area to indicate an amphibious opera-
tion to the southward, perhaps against Port
Moresby.” If the Japanese had serious plans
for invasion of this country, which would
have called for the transport of 500,000 men
and all their supplies and support, they would
not have been turned back by the minor
losses incurred in the Coral Sea battle, which
the U.S. Navy did not rate as a major defeat
for them. It names Midway, a month later,
as the “first decisive defeat suffered by the
Japanese at sea in 450 years.”
In any case it was two months after the
Coral Sea battle that the Japanese landed troops
on Guadalcanal, hundreds of miles south of
the battle area, and even towards the end of
the year they had command of the Bismarck
Sea and had been able to sink H.M.A.S. Can-
berra and other ships at Savo and penetrate to
Milne Bay and over the Owen Stanleys.
The real first cause for celebrations as the
turning-point of operations was the Buna cam-
paign and the battle for Guadalcanal.
One feature of the Coral Sea celebrations is
—and it is not the Americans’ doing but our
own—the persistent delusion created that to
them alone was due the turning-back of the
Japanese, perhaps with a little aid from
negligible Australian forces.
The New Guinea command is almost
invariably conceded to the Americans, and the
impression is regularly cultivated that they
had a huge army which saved the day. Aus-
tralia right through the New Guinea period
had more divisions —and more experienced divi-
sions—in the south-west area than U.S.
In the vital early battles which broke Japanese
power in New Guinea the only experienced
troops were battle-seasoned Australian troops,
the only officers experienced in modern war
were Australian officers. General Eichelberger,
for instance, good fellow that he is, and fine
commander, would be the first to concede the
facts of the rawness of his troops and of how
welcome were our Tobruk veterans. And he
certainly would be the last to agree with the
inferences contained in the version of the
Sydney “Daily Telegraph,” a journal which
claimed the right to run the war while it was
proceeding and now claims the privilege of
rewriting history to the detriment of Australian
soldiers: “Taking command of American and
Australian troops in the Buna-Gpna area in
November, 1942, he [General E.] fought for
three years up the long ladder to Japan.”
The facts are that the strategic command
in the south-west Pacific —a general planning
and organising command under the Chiefs of
Staffs Committee —was held by General
MacArthur. Under him the command of the
Allied land forces in the south-west Pacific
was held by General Blarney.
The first Australian army in the Buna-Gona
period was under the command of General
Lavarack. General Eichelberger, on arrival,
commanded I Corps, consisting of two untrained
American divisions (which rapidly became
tough) as part of General Lavarack’s com-
mand. In New Guinea General Eichelberger
commanded the Buna front —he had nothing

For Men 0n1y...
Into the life of every man there comes, inevitably, a moment just like this.
You’ve just had a wonderful dinner. You’re the Lord of the Manor
taking his ease. Your mood is mellow, your blood pressure’s perfect, and
you’re thinking to yourself that the Lady of the Manor is your idea of
the Ideal Girl.
And what happens then? Like a cannon shot in the peaceful hush of a
midsummer afternoon comes the Lady’s announcement . . .
She wants to buy a fur. Now. Right now. The Immediate present!
Well, before you gulp, bite through your cigar, jump your blood pressure,
let your mellow mood curdle, and start howling about the times and
taxes . . . please listen a little, sir.
Because she has some excellent . . . and, yes, thrift-minded reasons . . .
for buying that fur coat now,
1. A fur coat will outlast any two or three coats in point of wear and
she’ll always look lovely • . . glamorous . . . chic. And proud!
2. A fur coat will stay in fashion. To-day’s fur styles have a new easy-
going elegance that should be fashionable for years to come.
3. A fur coat is an entire wardrobe of coats all in one. It’s a sports coat
. . . an everyday utility coat ... a dress coat ... an evening wrap!
Being a reasonable man . . . and loving husband . . . you’ll see that
the lady really has the evidence.
For thrift . . . and for thrill . . . 1952 . . . your year to buy furs!

to do with Gona—under the overall command
of General Herring in the area. In the later
part of his operation Brigadier George Wootten
was lent to him as an experienced officer to
command one of his wings.
The dreadful little bits of jungle-fighting on
the road to Salamaua and Lae were mainly
Australia’s affair. The Huon campaigns were
ours under Lt.-Generai Berryman, and after that
the drive northwards was mostly a matter of
holding, harrying and mopping-up. The Ameri-
can landing operations at Hollandia were un-
resisted. The Noemfor and Biak and other later
shows were on a minor scale.
This does not mean that the Americans did
not do some very heavy fighting. Guadalcanal,
the New Georgia fighting, the Kula Gulf
battles, Vela Lavella, Munda, the sea-
fighting round the Solomons, the blasting of
Rabaul —all these involved a huge operation,
mainly American, But these were outside
General MacArthur’s area. The fact is that
our own troops and our own commanders rate
the honor of being the people who did most
of the land-fighting and much of the sea- and
air-fighting in the Australian sphere, and the
country should know it and give them credit
for it.
It should also be on record that they were
only trained and available at the crucial period
because of Australia’s policy, resisted by the
“Labor” party in office at the time of Pearl
Harbor, of sending volunteer Imperial forces
abroad to become battle-hardened.
POLITICAL POINTS
The new “Premiers’ plan” is to demand
the abandonment of the Commonwealth
Government’s defences against inflation
and to pay for Government works with
paper money that the loan-market can’t
support. Apart from the lack of money,
the mate ah vequisite simpr’y do not exist
- thanks to the 40-hour week.
The Menzies Government over 12
months has undeniably:
1. Revitalised and equipped the defence ser-
vices, which “Labor” had virtually destroyed for
any effective value in crisis.
2. Legislated to assist the industrial groups
within the unions to make headway, through
secret union ballots, against the Communist
tyranny which was destroying all trade-union
democracy —a duty political “Labor” had
funked all the years it was in office.
3. Set in train budgetary measures to check
the inflation which has been undermining indus-
trial and investment values.
4. Made the Pacific Pact with U.S.A. for
common cause in preserving peace in this
ocean which the “Labor” Government could
not do.
That is a good year’s work, and is the
best promise for success in the difficult
period still to be faced. The Evatt
attempt to besmear it is the usual mere
croaking.
“During the whole of the period in
which the Menzies-Fadden Government
has held office,” says Dr. Evatt, “the Gov-
ernment has stood idly by, despite spiral-
ling and catastrophic inflation.” In truth,
for more than half the period—from
the beginning of 1950 till the middle of
1951 —the Menzies Government was
thwarted, and its announced course of
action deliberately blocked, by obstruc-
tion for purely party ends by the pre-
cooked “Labor” majority in the Senate.
Only after a double-dissolution in mid-
-1951 and the destruction of “Labor’s”
Senate majority did the Menzies Gov-
ernment have power to legislate anything.
That loss of priceless time, and the
sharper edge taken by the inflationary
menace in consequence, was political
“Labor’s” own contribution to the Com-
munist efforts to make economic con-
fusion worse. As soon ,as the Menzies-
Fadden Government obtained effective
power to tackle the country’s problems
it brought down the Budgetary provisions
against which Dr. Evatt and “Labor”
have never ceased howling because of
their interruption to the community’s
complacent drift into the calamity the
Communists want to see brought on.
One of the last speeches of the late
“Labor” leader, J. B. Chifiey, was to urge
the Government to do just these things
that his successor now denounces as
“avoidable hardships,” “savage” credit
restrictions, and “setback to full employ-
ment”—“setback,” forsooth, because in-
stead of last year’s 120,000 jobs lacking
hands there are now only 60,000 or so
more jobs than hands to take them.
“Loulalo”: 3KZ, Victoria, had a neat

Obvious explanation of the celestial
“saucer” phenomenon observed in N. S.
Wales travelling in all directions is that
it was the great States-loan bubble rising
over Canberra.
Any doubts about what the United
Kingdom will do if Indo-China is invaded
from the north were settled by Mr. Eden
when he said that such an invasion would
create a situation as serious as that in
Korea and that Britain would not fail to
take her part in resisting it. Actually it
would be far more serious than any attack
on Korea, for it would open the way
directly to Thailand and Malaya, result in
a blockade of Hong Kong, bring the
Chinese air forces within striking distance
of Manila and make the control which
Peking already claims over the waters of
the China Sea down to the Borneo coast
a reality.
Communist riots in Tokyo last week
are calculated to do the cause more harm
than good with the average Japanese.
They will have about the same effect on
the average citizen, seeing that some of
• the worst mob violence took place outside
Imperial Palace gates, as a similar
exhibition of rowdyism Outside Bucking-
ham Palace in London, And coupled
with Russian seizure and firing on
Japanese fishing-boats within sight cVthe
Japanese coast they will fan the rising
fear and hatred of Russia which is felt
by about 90 per cent, of Japanese.
The 11-month-old discussions for an
“overall solution” of the Korean situa-
tion continued at Panmunjong during the
week, while the troops continued a savage
exchange of pleasantries along much of
the 145 miles of the defence-line. The
Eighth Army Command estimates that
Allied casualties, including South Korean,
are in the region of 400,000 and the
enemy had lost about 1,500,000. The
Allies estimate that they killed 4340 and
wounded another 5000-odd during April.
Truce—it’s wonderful!
“Six Victorian Hikers Found Well, but
Exhausted by Ordeal” —newspaper head-
ing on the missing Marysville hikers.
With “State Premiers” substituted for
“Victorian hikers” it would be an exact
description of that after-Loan-Council
feeling.
N.S.W. Minister for Mines Arthur
finally got away on his honeymoon tour
(B. 30/4/’52), but not until his former
wife had been placated on the score of
financial guarantees. On a promise by
Arthur to transfer 4000 shares in Con-
structors (Industrial and Engineering),
Ltd., to both his son and daughter the
Registrar in Divorce adjourned the hear-
ing until August, and the honeymoon
began. The Constructors concern is in-
terested in opencut coalmining and what-
not.
The Victorian prohibitionists have
announced that that they will oppose any
moves in Melbourne to lengthen drinking
hours during the currency of the Olympic
Games. Some of the athletes taking part
would like to be as quick off the mark
as this.
Though pretty well every paper in
Melbourne announced days beforehand
that “Labor”-leader Cain —the other half
of the Premiership which bears Mc-
Donald’s name —intended to move in
the State Assembly for a lottery, legis-
lators pretended to be astonished when
he introduced a private member’s bill to
that effect. McDonald is opposed to a
lottery ; so is his party—what’s left of it.
Cain will need the support of eight or
nine of the Liberal Opposition, and, since
he can’t really expect that, his move is
no more than a sop to the A.L.P., which
professes to want a lottery.
The Mutual Security Administration of
France has developed a unique armored
car that carries a driver at each end and
can change its direction in a split-second.
If the forward driver decides it is time to
beat a hasty retreat a lever is flipped and
the driver at the other end can drive the
car at 70 m.p.h. in the opposite direction.
It is unreliably reported that the adminis-
tration got this novel notion after con-
templating the performance of the
McDonald-Cain Government in Mel-
bourne.
A public meeting at the Sydney suburb
of Maroubra, where many of the lesser
civil servants live, was called to protest
against increased rates, but soon became
a barney over a proposed community
hotel. In the middle of it a man arose
and the chairman demanded his name.
“George,” he declared. It brought the
house down. “Peter” and “George” are
two mysterious figures the marathon
N.S.W. liquor commission wants to get
hold of.
Brisbane Lord Mayor Chandler, listing
the achievements of his non-sectarian,
i-political Citizens’ Municipal Organi-
on in his policy-speech for Brisbane
1 g elections, referred to the “very small
increase” in Brisbane rates since 1940
and said that in Sydney, “where there are
a Labor City Council and a Labor Gov-
ernment, the estimated tram and bus
deficit this year was £2,610,000 —con-
siderably more than the whole rate-
revenue of Greater Brisbane.” Chandler
said the worst thing that can happen to
local-government is the introduction of
party politics. Whether that be the main
cause or not, Sydney’s rates, like its
transport losses, are now at a record
high level.
Sundry Federal members arrived in
Canberra on Sunday—couldn’t get a
drink, couldn’t get a meal, couldn’t get
a smoke. They’re talking about im-
peaching the president of the Senate, or
something like that. Their constituents
suffer the same deprivations every time
they travel on Sundays, but who cares
about them!
Members of the Fellow-travellers’ Old
Boys’ Association turn up in the most
unexpected places. The general secretary
of the N. S. Wales A.L.P. has just re-
ceived a letter from “Mr. Jack Hooke, of
the Australian Legation at the Hague,”
who is ecstatic about the “A.L.P. News,”
in which he finds items of interest not in
any other paper. When last heard of
previously Mr. Hooke was reported
as helping Mr. J. Healy (Watersiders) to
pilot a Communist-invented soldier re-
habilitation scheme through an A.L.P.
Annual Conference in 1946 and two years
earlier moving that the Communist party
be allowed to affiliate with the A.L.P.
In refusing to join with other Allied
Governments in ending the state of war
with Japan, Russia is merely applying
the old policy of “Last in, last out.”
If you are going abroad by ship or
’plane you can take 21b. of sugar without
a Customs permit— not 2£lb. But you
can’t take a bottle of sugar-and-water
under any circumstances unless it’s
flavored and “analysis reveals that the
syrup is in fact flavored.” This infor-
mation is published as a warning to every-
body to be careful. Imagine the em-
barrassment of being dragged off a liner
with a bottle of unflavored sugar-and-
water in your possession!
The Ghoolendaadi people lost their
appeal against the N.S.W. Government
seizure of their land for soldier-settle-
ment at 1942 values. The land was “pro-
claimed” in 1950 and the appellants
claimed that its value then was £330,000
more than in 1942. Dismissing the
appeal, Justice Sugerman said that it was
hard to see how the Closer Settlement
Board could be entitled to assess on a
1942 basis, but the court was bound to
follow the directions of the statute. And
the statute, as was proven in the High
Court, gives the N.S.W. Government the
right to resume properties on any terms
it thinks fit. In this it differs from the
Federal Government, which is bound by
the Commonwealth Constitution to offer
“just terms” for any property it might
resume. The McGirr-Cahill crowd have
not hesitated to use their power for what
amounts to calculated robbery.
The A.W.U. has had to accept reduced
wages in the pastoral industry in all States
except Queensland because of lower
wool prices—a good shearer will come
down about £lO a week. In 1950 and
1951 the wages had increased propor-
tionately with rising wool prices on the
A.W.U. claim for prosperity loadings.
What has to be watched now is the
inevitable Communist trying to cause
shearing strikes.
At the beginning of last week the
N.S.W. electricity heads told everybody
concerned that they could expect more
and longer blackouts and urged them to
make preparations for them. Then
Premier Cahill, who was Minister for
Blackouts before becoming Premier, an-
nounced that it was not so. A new gene-
rator at Pyrmont—another new one had
been burnt out or something the week
before and was a total loss —would “ease”
blackouts, and “I believe we are nearly
out of trouble. I feel we can be optim-
istic rather than pessimistic.” But people
are still stocking up with candles and
kerosene.
Randwick (Sydney) Council was here
told (B. 30/4/’52) that before it rushed
into building a £250,000 community hotel
and centre, which it proposes to do, it
ought to see about establishing a muni-
cipal market so that people in the thickly-
populated Randwick-Waverley area could
buy cheap fruit and vegetables. The
council beat the gun by announcing, a few
hours after The Bulletin went to press,
that it would establish such a market
“within a few weeks,” Good luck to it.
One sensible comment on the six
hikers who were recovered from the Mel-
bourne outer-suburban fringe after half
the search resources of the Common-
wealth had been mobilised to find them
was made by A. Charlesworth, father of
one of them. He said: “Individual hikers
or groups of hikers should not be allowed
to go out without leaving behind them
a plan of their routes as a guide should
any trouble befall them.”
The inevitable “Labor” politician arose
in Victoria last week to demand slum
abolition. N.S.W. has had long spells of
government by “Labor” politicians; it
has the worst slums of the lot, including
its so-called workers’ flats, which have
replaced older-type slums here and there
at enormous cost in foundation-stones and
other things.

Works and Credit
Australia’s economic position,
from the political point of view,
is reaching an awkward stage.
Inflationary pressure is still on,
and there is still trade-union re-
luctance to do a fair day’s work
for a fair day’s pay:—in any case
the 40-hour week, as worked,
makes that difficult. Manpower
is turning only slowly to basic
industries, and there is still a
large volume of spending-power
in the hands of the consuming
public. But contrasting sharply
with these conditions are the
difficulty of raising loan money
to finance public works and the
fall in the taxation potential as
a result of the decline in wool
prices and the export income.
Though there are a host of
public works that are more
essential today than they were
two years ago, the time has not
yet come when it would be safe
to make bank credit available to
finance them. Inflation must be
definitely checked before any
substantial resort is made to bank
credit as a means of bridging
the Budget gap. There must,
also, be visible evidence that
sloth, waste and larrikmism have
been purged from essential in-
dustries, such as coal, shipping
and transport. We have to be
sure that we can find manpower
and materials for the works pro-
gramme.
Though superficial evidence
at the moment points to a short-
age of loan money and taxa-
tion revenue as the reason for
the difficulty in getting ahead
with public-works programmes,
the real reasons go much deeper
than that. There are still too
many people in non-essential and
unproductive industries, and
those employed in what are re-
garded as essential industries
are, too often, not pulling their
weight. Unless a large labor
force is available, together with
raw materials, fuel and power
required, to get on with the
planned programme of public
works, then it would be futile as
well as financially dangerous to
attempt any credit-expansion for
the purpose. It would only add
to the monetary waste and the
inflation, and the net result would
probably be a smaller yield
in public-works construction,
especially as hot-house finance
of the bank-credit kind, coupled
with a policy of “full employ-
ment,” usually means more
slacking on the job. Many of
our trade-unions seem to be re-
solved to learn practical
economics the hard way; until
they have learnt the elementary
facts of economic life it is no
use trying to nurse them too
tenderly.
Every effort should be made
now to force the ultimate issue,
which is a stiffening of our
economic muscle to the point
where the country can get ahead
with essential national works,
both public and private. It is
time for an assessment of what
we really can do, provided the
people as a whole work reason-
able hours and do a reasonable
job, and then attempt to achieve
a target within that assessment.
We have been by no means
achieving the possible in any
section of industry over the past
seven years.
Not only trade-unionists are
to blame for the present low rate
of national productivity. De-.
partmental controls and inter-
ference are almost as bad. There
are, undoubtedly, far too many
civil servants in Australia today.
not only interfering through the
red-tape they create, but also
through the taxation that is im-
posed to pay their salaries. And
they are not helping to produce
those materials in short supply.
The redundant civil servant is
usually a “temporary” one taken
on during the last war and who
has never really learned his job
properly.
Also to blame are some busi-
nessmen who have become
accustomed to regular, even if
not spectacular, profits as a
result of ever-increasing selling-
prices and the “economics of
scarcity.” For several years,
until recently, no stock has been
bad stock and no book-debts
have been irrecoverable. The
vulnerable businessmen of today
have been discouraged by price-
control from increasing their
efficiency, and at the same time
encouraged to accept the maxi-
mum controlled price as their
minimum. They have never
learned that business is a skilled
occupation, subject to unrelent-
ing economic laws. They are
hot-house products the same as
many of the younger generation
of trade-unionists.
These things all cry for cor-
rection. We shall get nowhere
until our rate of production
generally is increased. It can
obviously be stepped up greatly
even if we continue with the 40-
hour week, but it is more likely
that, with our great arrears cf
public works to overcome, the
40-hour week will have to go. It
certainly appears to be a most
glaring anachronism in our
present circumstances, which can
be best described as a produc-
tion slump.
This production slump must
be overcome before credit can
be safely expanded to alleviate
any financial slump. We have
had a growing depression in pro-
duction for the past 10 years,
whereas for most of that period
we have had a financial boom.
Attending to first things first, the
production problem must be
dealt with. If we put the cart
before the horse we shall have
gross and uncontrollable in-
flation.
Collapse of Govt. Planning
Victorian Institute of Public
Affairs quarterly “Review” does
a service to the Australian
electorate by recording the cur-
rent “assault on overall Gov-
ernment planning” by prominent
British businessmen and critics.
Professor Jewkes, from the
chair of Economic Organisation
at Oxford, in the American
“Fortune”;
If the U.S. had since 1945 followed
the policy of Britain in nationalising
industries, maintaining detailed con-
trols on the whole economy and
equalising incomes by British rates
of taxation, would the U.S. have been
capable of her great achievements, the
rapid increase in the standard of
living, the acceptance of world-
leadership, the generous assistance to
impoverished countries, her arma-
ments effort? I doubt it. Every
thinking person in Britain realises
that British central planning has
failed.
Geoffrey Crowther, editor of
the “Economist”:
British economy is moving from
crisis to crisis in progressively worsen-
ing degrees of severity. Other coun-
tries, even Western Germany and
Japan, are unmistakably on the way
back. The reason is that, whereas
Britain has been operating under “a
soft economy,” the other countries
have under ‘‘hard econo-
mies.” A “soft economy” is one
m which nobody can get hurt and
nobody can be very successful
The individual must be allowed to
retain more of his own earnings;
business must be forced to compete,
price-control wherever possible must
be abolished. Britain must take a
decisive step away from Government
controls.
Roy Harrod, joint editor of
the “Economic Journal” and a
notable economist of the day:
Controls are in the nature of a
disease, which proliferates and tends
to spread through the whole economic
organism. One control gives rise to
the need for another, and as controls
multiply new disequilibria appear and
create an apparent need for still more
controls; each crisis in turn seems to
call for direct Government handling,
which after an interval produces a
further crisis.
Harrod’s statement of the
condition into which Britain has
fallen is horribly true of Aus-
tralia also. “The decline in the
belief in a free-enterprise system
has occurred among members of
all parties and of no party,
among businessmen as well as
civil servants, among plain
citizens as well as long-haired
intellectuals. It has occurred
even among those foremost in
paying lip-service to the
principle of economic liberty.”
V.I.P.A. “Review” asks what
justification there can be for
further price-control in Aus-
tralia. It is not a means of con-
trolling inflation, since it has
been accompanied by the biggest
peace-time inflation in Australian
history. It has not limited pro-
fits, especially those of the most
avaricious—the blackmarketeers.
So far as it has assisted produc-
tion, that has been in non-
essentials, the “milk-bar
economy.” It has not conduced
to stability, for never has the
country’s economy been more
unstable:
If the reply is that price-fixation
has been ineffective because the Com-
monwealth Government was not given
power to carry out the job and pay
subsidies, then two answers can be
made. First, if price-control by the
States is futile, where is the point in
persisting with it? Second, even if
the Commonwealth Government had
been given the authority to control
prices, then the bill in the form of
subsidies necessary for reasonable
stability would have been too terrific
to contemplate.
Britain has attained much greater
stability of prices than Australia, but
at what cost? First at the cost of
rigid wage-pegging. Would the advo-
cates of control in Australia have
been prepared to accept that?
Second, at the cost of some
£5OO million a year in subsidies which
have to be financed by taxation.
Would control advocates in this
country have been prepared to accept
that?
The argument is concluded
with an illustration from the in-
consistency of leaving wool
prices free and compelling wheat
to be sold at home substantially
below its world price, to show
how Government interference
with the price mechanism has
distorted the pattern of pro-
duction and aggravated the very
condition it is designed to cor-
rect. There is need for national
planning, but “the multitude of
futile and petty Government
controls are overshadowing and
confusing the real purposes of
economic planning.”
As regards the import-cuts, in
view of the position that had
arisen the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment was compelled to take
immediate corrective action;
but the cuts “represent a near-
tragedy for this country”;
The truth is that the Australian
balance-of-payments crisis is deep-
rooted in the instability and weak-
ness of the Australian economy, and
it is likely to be with us until those
instabilities and weaknesses have been
eradicated.
It is a crisis of low productivity and
inadequate production inadequate
production of exportable commodities
and low productivity in many
branches of the Australian economy.
The tragedy lies in that “we
are being forced back, despite all
our efforts to break free, into a
tightly-controlled economy.”

WE WORK FOR EACH OTHER.
[From H. Bruce Gibson, a Sydney industrialist prominent, in
Legacy .]
The statement attributed to
Professor Sir Douglas Copland
that “Australia is facing a reces-
sion because of a fall in its ex-
port income” will be contended
by other economists, for econo-
mists, being theorists, seldom
agree.
Copland offers remedial
measures. Ten per cent,
extra effort (meaning 10
per cent, additional output)
could maintain our present
high standards. Alternatively,
he feels that further deprecia-
tion of our currency may be
necessary, causing us “to share
the loss on some agreed basis
whereby everybody’s standard
of living would be affected.”
How the economists and
statisticians, and particularly Dr.
Coombs, who advanced their
theories and opinions to the
Commonwealth Arbitration
Court Full Bench only four to
five years ago, should squirm
after reading that statement,
for the 10 per cent, extra effort
means nothing more or less than
restoration of the 44-hour week!
Australia is naturally rich,
young as a nation, and prone to
feel removed from the cares and
difficulties suffered by other
countries not so well en-
dowed by nature. We have been
subject to political expediency
and therefore taught to feel that
industrially we can produce pros-
perity by legislation. More and
more of the government and
direction of our lives, and also
the affairs of the nation, are
being placed in the hands of ex-
union secretaries and good
“party” men, for we like men
who promise good things even
if, at the back of our minds,
we feel they are impossible of
fulfilment.
Is it any wonder that when
these opportunists reach their
goal or cushioned seat, with
salary many times their read
worth, they are bewildered, and,
except as mouthpieces, leave
administration to their depart-
mental heads and rely on the
advice of self-seeking party
friends and the theories of our
university-produced economists?
How many good unionists today
would contend the statement
that the 40-hour week, and also
each succeeding piece of indus-
trial legislation, has not caused
harder working conditions for
his wife?
Mr. Churchill once said “we
cannot deny the lessons of his-
tory,” Applied to industry, we
in Australia can learn a lot from
the history and mistakes of the
depression in the early nineteen-
thirties. At that time the seasons
were good, food was plentiful,
and yet our Governments could
give little lead to maintain
employment, reduce surplus
labor and retain ordinary stan-
dards. They resorted to the
moving of sandhills by manual
labor and the institution of the
dole. It is obvious now that
such reproductive works as cor-
rection of the break-of-gauge on
our rail systems, extensive water-
conservation, improvement to
harbors and wharfage and the
like could have been accom-
plished from our own resources
without great imports of
materials, at the same time add-
ing to our natural wealth ; for
all of those items, and many
more, would have been wealth-
producing.
The lessons of that recession
or depression can be applied
now. Since 1945 we have heard
of a huge public-works pro-
gramme which was to be held in
abeyance to cushion any local
setback. We do not seem to
hear of it any more; why not
it is hard to say, for though
20 years have passed since our
last depression the before-
mentioned works are still await-
ing our labor, and with them
enormous defence works, hous-
ing, etc., all largely possible of
creation with even less depend-
ence on imports than previously.
Housing of the people was not
the problem in 1930 that it is
today. That it is a problem now
is beyond question, and housing
can be carried out with produc-
tion solely from Australian
labor, for there is not an item in
an ordinary house that need be
imported from overseas. We
are seeking migrants from
abroad, and each migrant im-
ported costs us quite a lot of
money. This money is repaid
by the wealth he later produces,
but our best migrants are un-
doubtedly the children of our
own people, and if we had more
and better housing we would
have more children.
Most economists will concede
the point that the affairs of a
nation are the affairs of a family,
only on a much larger scale.
When a young man and woman
decide to marry they know that
their individual and collective
responsibilities will increase.
They are optimistic, otherwise
they wouldn’t take the step, for
it can happen that sickness and
other unforeseen happenings will
drain their slender finances.
They usually wish for their own
home, and often enter into
financial commitments that only
an optimistic outlook allows.
Many thousands of young Aus-
tralian couples have found suc-
cess and happiness, and later
independence and financial
security, by adherence to this
optimistic outlook, but to make
it succeed they have had to work
hard. They have, almost without
exception, to borrow money and
so mortgage their future, but.
with optimism and will to win,
any setback or recession is only
a signal for harder work, and so
additional production for the
home.
This same principal applies to
a business or partnership; it
applies to all life, whether it be
the ants in the anthill or the bees
in the hive. It applies also to
our Australian economy. There
is no need for a recession in
Australia, and there is little need
for university-trained economists
to tell us how to avoid it. We
are a young, virile country with
good material to work on ; there
are few countries that are so self-
sufficient as ours. But we must
curb our liking for luxuries, we
must discriminate in our selec-
tion of overseas imports, we
must be optimistic in our
financial outlook and even mort-
gage our future; and we must
work.
Regardless of false prophets.
it is still a fact that labor is the
lot of man. Playing about with
currency-depreciation will not, in
the long run, give us the stan-
dards of living this country is
capable of, and if, as at least
one economist implies, a rever-
sion to the 44-hour week is
necessary, then let our legis-
lators be big enough to come
forward and admit it. We have
temporarily forsaken the
principle that we all work for
each other, that we gain if we
are happy in service, even should
it be menial. Without a doubt we
were courageous in war and ready
to accept those first principles.
Unless we regain them we will
continue to lose the peace.

“Matey”: Dockyard scene, 10 a.m. I
pick up a drill to bore a hole through
a steel-plate. Union bloke walks by,
stops me. Says it’s a fitter’s job. Tells
me to send my laborer to look for the
fitter; I start looking for my laborer.
10.30: I find him playing cards in the
lavatory. Send him to look for the fitter.
11 a.m.: He arrives with the fitter. Fitter
says he can’t work without his laborer.
I sdnd my laborer to look for his laborer.
Fitter and I yarn and have a smoke while
we wait. 11.15; Fitter goes over to
have yarn with a mate. 11.30: My
laborer finds the fitter’s laborer sun-
baking on the deck of the ship alongside,
brings him back to the job. We yam
and have a smoke while we wait for the
fitter. 11.45: I send the two laborers to
look for the fitter. 12 o’clock: Whistle
blows. 1 p.m.: Start rounding them up
again. 3 p.m.: Everybody on the job.
The foreman, the union bloke, the two
laborers and myself stand around the
fitter. He picks up the drill and bores
the hole. Time: 30 seconds. I go on
with the job,

“Minto”: All sorts of monkey-business
goes on at city markets (B. 23/4/’52).
They’re much the same in all the capital
cities. The prospective buyer needs to
be as wideawake as a tourist getting off
the boat at Aden with souvenirs in mind.
“Has she gone yet?"
I arrived at the shop the other day to
find Percy, our vegetable-buyer, hopping-
mad at the state of a consignment of
cabbages which he’d bought. He was
bellowing into the phone so hard that
the offending agent could hardly under-
stand him. “They’re not fit for human
consumption,” roared Percy,. and then,
the indignation out of his system, “Well,
not at that price, anyhow!”

“Fradelle”; Tough as hide, hard as
granite, but as honest as they make them,
he was a very powerful customer to
several southern firms. From his battered
typewriter came letters that could have
set fire to the mail-planes. Shocked
secretaries hesitated to place them on
their managers’ desks and embarrassed
heads of departments were forced to make
a rule that all letters arriving from Towns-
ville were to be opened by them person-
ally. Then his niece, fresh from a busi-
ness course, undertook to do his typing.
She was used to Uncle and his language,
and unknown to him licked his letters
into beautiful shape, but results from the
south were disappointing and slow.
Uncle, puzzled and frustrated, began to
fear he was losing his punch, and talked
of selling out —until he came across a file
of niece-typed duplicates! Avoiding a
seizure by a miracle, he punched out
some very pungent letters, using every
known invective and curse. By train,
plane and ship his orders poured north,
and although Niece still works for him at
the store he insists on doing his own
typing.

“Rann”: Home-team comment. In a
paper circulating in the Manly district
the following football reports appeared:
“Rugby League.—Manly-Warringah were
in great form last Saturday when they
defeated St. George 34 to 17 at S.C.G.”
“Rugby Union, —Gordon 9, Manly 3.
The match was played at Chatswood.”

“Geoff’s Son”: In the back bar of a
quiet Hobart pub the barman had a silver
handlebar moustache, a North-Country
accent and no idea of pouring beer. The
ngw-chum looked disgustedly at the flat
beer in his threequarter-filled glass and
said “Here, get a glass and I’ll show you
how to pour a proper beer.” The bar-
man obeyed, “Put her under the tap and
squirt about two inches of froth into it.”
Again the barman obeyed. “Hell, no.
That’s top much froth. Now fill her
from the jug.” The glass filled, the tutor
picked up the finished lesson, looked at it
quizzically. “Not the best. Too much
froth first time. Only needs about two
inches. Try her again.” The barman
turned for another glass. His tutor downed
the experimental beer. I watched the
lesson for another three beers. The
tutor downed the lot and didn’t part with
a penny. For all I know he’s still at it.

“Hist”: Salesmanship? A haberdasher
in a mountain town displayed a flam-
buoyant line of ties at 9s.
6d. each, but sales were
negligible. He put them
away for a few months,
then reintroduced them to
his show-window as the
“latest and loveliest,” at
225. 6d. each, and the
dudes queued up to buy.
Again, a country store-
keeper was misled into cal-
culating that a shortage of
soap was imminent, and
crammed his shop with
stocks. Sales remained
normal, and soap began to
haunt his dreams. So he
adopted “Operation Short-
age.” The procedure is to
refuse any customer his
full order; two bars in-
stead of three, half a case
instead of a full case —as
a favor. Once launched
the scheme runs itself. The
customer leaves the shop
smiling knowingly to him-
self, and commissions two
or three pals to go in and
buy soap for him. They
all go home and tell their
wives “Soap looks like be-
ing hard to get,” and
soap in double quanti-
ties appears on every shop-
ping list for 50 miles
around, until the momen-
tum dies down —by which
time the storekeeper’s
stocks are back to normal.

“Sturt St.”: If “H.
Hardupp” (B. 2/4/’52)
still wants to see a joss-
house he will find one in
the Main-road, Ballarat.
And though his European-
ised Celestial replied
blandly that he was a
Presbyterian the average Australian
Chinaman still has a soft spot for his
ancestors’ gods. The Ballarat joss-house
having been for years without a congre-
gation, the local Historical Society thought
it would be a good idea to salvage some
of the furnishings before time and van-
dals brought destruction; some fine
camphorwood and cedar boards, adorned
with Chinese script in gold lettering,
would have made very attractive exhibits
in the city’s museum. There were sugges-
tions, too, that joss and his throne might
well be removed from his dusty loneliness
and given a place of honor there. But
before many of the suggestions could be
put into action, out of the blue came a
legal interdict, a lawyer’s letter forbidding
the removal of any of the joss-house
treasures and demanding that if any had
been taken they be returned pronto.
Shortly after this a large sedan with a
Melbourne number-plate halted in the
Main-road. Joss was reverently carried
out, placed in a rear seat, and so departed
to another sphere. But the empty joss-
house is still there.

“Hamer”: Ephemeral indeed is that
fame some people fancy they may give
a degree of permanency by inscribing it
on bricks and stone. A recent Sydney
fire was described as being on premises
“formerly McEvoy Chambers, but now
known as Pitt Street Chambers.” Boot-
maker Jim McEvoy thought that building
would keep his name prominent in the
heart of Sydney ; old Ebenezer Vickery
had a similar illusion. Vickery’s
Chambers would remain as his monu-
ment, he said; but that warren of offices
was demolished, and in its place rose
Bryant House, designed to keep the name
of the head of the Union Trustee Co.
green. The Queensland Insurance Co.,
however, bought it after Bryant’s death
and it took the company’s name. What
used to be Manning’s Chambers (in Judge
W. P. Manning’s days) in King-street
became Innes Chambers when Mr. Justice
Long Innes bought it. George Crowley
(of the City Mutual) had a bitter quarrel
with the judge over what he regarded as
unfair judicial remarks in a judgment
affecting his company, and in a meeting
in the street he told the judge that his
name would be obliterated from that
building. It was. Crowley told me that
Innes expressly directed that the property
should not be allowed to fall into bis
hands—he secured it in a roundabout
way—but Crowley’s Chambers is no
longer the address of the office tenants.
It was “Supreme Court Chambers” the
last time I noticed. A building on the
tramroad to Rozelle certainly still carries
the inscription “R. Wood and Co., Estab-
lished 1880,” Nobody knows “R. Wood,”
or who he was ; so even if a name stands
it means nothing. Ask anyone why any
of the numerous Bent-streets are so
named and they will reply “Because it’s
crooked.” There is no remembrance of
Surveyor-General Bent who scattered his
name over a score of townships. The
sort of name that lives is the sort Nelson
and Napoleon established —or, for that
matter, Judas.

“Observer”: The phenomenon of the
“Brocken Spectre” (B 9/4/’52) may not
be so uncommon as is generally sup-
posed. From a hill at Sumner, South
Island (N.Z.), I saw my image very
clearly in a mist above a hill much higher
than that on which I was standing. This
was several years ago, and about 10 a.m.
I watched the spectacle for about one
minute and was surprised that no other
object near by was silhouetted in the
mist. Unlike the Tararua trampers Ido
not recollect any halo around my shadow.
A curious feature of my image was that
it was not in a direct line with the posi-
tion of the sun and myself.
* * * ♦
“H.T.”: Haves and Have-nots? Over
50 years ago my German master taught
me the following couplet:
Sein oder nicht sein, das ist die frage.
Haben oder nicht haben, das ist die antwort.
To be or not to be, that is the question,
To have or not to have, that is the answer.
At the time I understood from his atti-
tude that this was a kind of secret or
pass-phrase among those who were con-
versant with the couplet. Further, when-
ever quoting the couplet he always used
a sign which I took to be a sign of
silence; his manner implied that some-
thing secret lay behind the mere words.
What that something was he did not
reveal.
“ There's a rumor going round that it's a fal[?]."
A ROD FOR THE BACK.
“Come liue with mee and by my loue”
How mournfully the lines recur!
The shepherd’s pinchbeck treasure-trove
He promised then to give to her,
The cap of flowers and the kittle,
Slippers of gold with woollen soles,
The broideries of leaves-of-myrtle,
Are cheap at Woolworths’ and at Coles’.
She might have been well satisfied
With these and an occasional grizzle
Had I been more at pains to hide
Acquaintanceship with saw and chisel.
Two model sailing-boats went by,
A windmill-dancer had her day,
Viewed by a tolerant wifely eye:
“We know, of course, the child must play.”
So suns rose up and suns went down
On—more or less —a happy home
Till Mrs. Swilliam went to town
Aad came back followed by a bomb.
A bomb, ' case you query it.
Is how those persons who unload
Used cars up a the common cit.
Refer to one that may explode.
This bomb however, was a chest-
Of-drawers; aged, infirm, unsteady,
Cracked, top and sides, warped, grimed and
grfeased.
As though it were blown-up already.
But, as my wife said, it would do—
In fact, was needed —for the kids
If I could make the drawers go;
And this would save us quids and quids.
Such humble work it might have stayed.
But here, at last, I met my doom
For many years so well delayed:
The cedar-front began to bloom!
For cedar flowers best in death,
And we, like Sleeping Beauty’s lover,
Waste disproportionate toil and breath
The more forbidding is the cover.
I shall not bore you with my toil
(I’ve bored so many with it lately—
Patching and sanding, linseed-oil);
Suffice the chest woke, tall and stately,
Cedar of every tone and mark,
Swirling and straight, and red and honey,
The pink and brown, the chocolate-dark —
“My God,” my wife said. “That’s worth
money - ! ”
It filled her with a single thought,
That I should play some similar tricks
Upon a chiffonier she’d bought
Ten years ago, for twelve-and-six.
Cedar, it was, gnawn and unstable —
And here I must especially heed her:
It must be stained to match a table
And chairs, all stained to look like cedar.
This marvel hardly was contrived,
Complete with modern-antique knobs.
When an old ottoman arrived,
The toughest of my Augean job's:
“The linen-chest must be vacated
And fitted as our small boys’ tallboy,
The linen to be situated
In the ottoman —but first of all, boy,
“Wreck our old Chesterfield, and use
Its flock and springing to restuff
The ottoman; the frame will do as
Kitchen-shelves —get going, love!”
And as she spoke it came to pass.
“Fancy,” she tells her friends, “I’ve got a
-man.
Maybe, to look at, not much class.
But you should see him stuff an ottoman!”
Meanwhile her growing fancy yields
A home of cedar bombs entire—
Fresh fields, chestnuttier Chesterfields
For me to pull from fiercer fire.
Such plans have cluttered-up her head.
No human love can hope to cross it —
I fear no rival but the bed.
No skeleton, except the closet.

‘■‘Pat”: I watched them engage in
battle in the furnishing department of a
city store. She was a voluble, couldn’t-
make-up-her-mind young woman ; he was
a stolid, never-changed-his-mind young
man. And yet the three consecutive
arguments over (1) loose covers, (2)
curtains, (3) feltex, all resulted in victories
for the female. After they had gone the
little salesman muttered darkly to me, *
“How did you like that? Anyone’d think
he wasn’t going to live in the house, too,
let alone pay for the stuff.” “Oh, well,”
I said, “isn’t it usually agreed that
women’s taste is more discriminating than
men’s?” The little man scowled. “So
it is,” he exploded, “Just look at the
husbands they pick and the wives we get!”
* * * *
“Silentio”: There’s many a tragedy
hidden in the past with New Australians.
Boarded a Concord (Sydney) bus recently
and sat beside a Czech in the thirties,
pretty down-at-heel and with few words
of English. From the seat in front a
three-year-old boy turned, grinned happily
and thrust a chubby hand towards the
man. For 15 minutes they smiled at each
other, hands closely knit, but not a word.
Before alighting the man drew a two-
shilling piece from his pocket, pressed it
in the boy’s hand and slipped from his
ssat, tears pouring down his face. I
wonder what chord of memory that little
Aussie’s action struck. It was obviously
deep-rooted.

“Ceg”: “Emjai,” writing of Mel-
bourne’s old cable-trams (B. 26/3/’52),
might have spared a line or two for the
conductors of those rockets of the ’nineties.
There were no “connies” in those days,
but I’ll swear that the acrobatic accountant
who swung so nimbly from dummy to
trailer-car had more safety-pins to the
square inch than any conny from the
date of her birth to maturity. These
large safety-pins, which were speared
through his tunic, carried a variety of
slips, cancelled tickets, transfers and other
odds and ends. In addition his
number was displayed on a large
silver-colored disk suspended on a
small strap. A tin box for change'and
unsold tickets, etc., was carried, and that,
with a small book, pencil, etc., completed
the set-up. In a wind, with all his trip-
slips fluttering, he looked like something
one would find in a Chinese joss-house.
“Queenscliff”: Another oddity of the
old cable-trams was the bell on the roof
of the dummy, furiously clanged when a
four-wheeled cab had the temerity to tres-
pass on the tram-line. On the different
public gala days, little flags were stuck on
the roof of the dummies and the appear-
ance of the trams was then completely toy-
like. Lighting arrangements were primitive
—kerosene lamps in the car and nothing
on the dummy except a huge box-like
affair about 4ft. by 2ft in the front and
one sickly little lamp for the gripman. It
would have been too terrible if, in the
dark, he had pulled the wrong lever. In
“rounding the curve” the conveyance
often left the rails and passengers on
the dummy then dismounted and lent a
hand to “push her on again.”
“Ardin”; Before the old-timers pass
out of memory there should be a mention
of ye olde horse-tram, manned by a crew
of one, who did all the “accounting” and
drove the two horses as well. At the
terminus the mokes were taken out and
hooked on to the other end for the return
journey. Change was given through a
little trap-door by the driver, and the
passenger then dropped the coin or ticket
into a glass-faced box. No “checks” were
given (consequently no litter) and if a
passenger had not paid a fare the driver
would furiously jiggle a brass hook to
draw attention to the fact. Happy days.

“Hamfat”: That drinking exploit of
“Elgey’s” Mexican Yank (B. 9/4/’52) was
matched at least once by actor Fitz-
herbert. Landing in New Zealand shortly
after the anti-shouting law had been
introduced, Fitzherbert made for a pub,
fell immediately into the company of five
old friends and called for six tankards.
He waved aside fears of the new penalties
and persuaded the barman to hand out
the drinks. They were hardly on the bar,
however, before the friends fell away and
a look of dismay showed on the barman’s
face. A police-inspector had entered the
bar and was walking towards them with
the look of a man who has made a cap-
ture, Fitzherbert saw that it was up to
him. He had just landed from a dry
trip and had been longing for a drink of
N.Z, beer after a long absence, he ex-
plained, and in, the enthusiasm of his
thirst he had ordered those six pewters
for himself. “All right,” said the
inspector grimly. “I’ll watch while you
drink them.” Drink them he did, too,
compelled to show a certain degree of
enthusiasm and disguise the ordeal that
neared breaking-point on the last two
tankards. He told me later that the feel-
ing of distension stayed with him for
weeks.
“Macnell”: The tragedy aboard U.S.
cruiser St. Paul off Korea recently, when
one of her for’ard Sin. turrets blew
up, recalls a similar blow-up in a British
cruiser well before War 11. Manned
by Marines, one gun of the twin turret
fired—unknown to the captain of the
other 8-incher, his gun had misfired.
Hearing the other’s explosion, he opened
his breech; the smouldering cordite,
fanned by fresh air, ignited. The blast
caught the cordite being loaded into the
other gun for the next salvo, and the
whole turret went up in a blast that killed
almost all hands. From that tragedy
evolved No. 21 interlock, a safety-device
in the form of a lever which must be
pulled by a crew-member before the gun-
“ It's one of those things I picked up at a
disposals sale, dear."
captain can open his breech. And No. 21
is not pulled until the gun has recoiled,
sure indication of its having fired. The
story goes that the inventor, a rating, was
rewarded with seven days’ leave! Inci-
dentally, the reference to gunpowder in
the U.S. cruiser-report probably was
meant to refer to the gunpowder igniter-
bag sewn onto the rear of the cordite-
charge. One hopes that our Pacific-
Pact allies have got past the saltpetre
stage—these days gunpowder is used in
the R.A.N, mainly for fireworks.

“Spokeshave”; An optimist is Adrian
Bendall, harpist of the Victorian
Symphony Orchestra, who has made a
novel suggestion for financing a per-
manent Australian opera. His plan is a
“I never did like period furniture!”
2 p.c. tax on entrance charges to all
sporting fixtures. A prominent Italian
conductor told him that this was the way
it was done in the home of opera, and
Mr. Bendall doesn’t think a football fan
would mind parting up an extra penny or
a punter an extra threepence for such
a noble purpose. He doesn’t know much
about his own country or’of Italy either.
In Italy the popular heroes are operatic
tenors, not footballers or jockeys. In
Melbourne I asked a colleague who were
his heroes. He said, “Breasley and
Ronnie Coleman.” When I asked him
who was the most famous Victorian tenor
he hadn’t a clue. As to Mr. Bendall’s
suggestion he said mildly, “Well, nobody
would mind if a penny tax were put on
all concert-tickets to help pay for the
Olympic Games.”
* * * *
“Cunedda”: If the tune to which both
“My Maryland” and the “Red Flag” are
sung is the same as the tune of the
German folksong “O Tannenbaum” (B.
9/4/’52) the composer seems to have
been no less distinguished a musical figure
than Chopin.
* * * *
“Uramao”: Re Horace Greeley’s
atrocious calligraphy (B. 2/4/’52). In the
newspaper office of Horace the com-
positors were fearful of his
handwriting. One of them
said that if Belshazzar had
seen the writing on the wall
in Greeley’s fist he’d have
been even more terrified.
Another comp, had made a
hash of a leading article of
Horace’s and incurred the
wrath of the great Yankee
journalist, who wrote him a
note of instant dismissal.
The comp, went to the rival
paper and applied for a job,
stating that he worked in
Greeley’s office. When asked
if he had a reference, he
handed the note of dismissal
to the foreman, who pored
over it dazedly for a while
and said: “All right, start
on Monday.” The lowa
Press Association once in-
vited Greeley to its gather-
ing. He replied, or tried to,
in the following terms: “I
have waited till longer wait-
ing would be discourteous,
only to find that I cannot
attend your Press meeting
in June, as I would like to
do. I find so many cares
and duties pressing me, and
with the weight of years I
feel obliged to decline any
invitation that takes me
away a day’s journey from
home.” The note’s illegi-
bility floored the Pressmen,
and the combined efforts of
their most brainy made the best they could
of it as follows: “I have wondered all
along whether any squirt had denied the
scandal about the President meeting Jane
in the woods on Saturday. I have hominy,
carrots and R.R. ties more than I could
move with eight steers. If eels are
blighted, dig them early. Any insinuation
that brick-ovens are dangerous to hams
gives me the horrors.”
* * * *
“B, A. Ker”; I readily agree that
“brazen” is a better word to describe a
criminal’s actions that “daring” (B.
2/4/ ’52); but experience taught me that
the perpetrators make no fine distinc-
tions. Working at a girls’ reformatory
school I found myself purring softly “I’ll
Be Home for Christmas.” “Huh,”
grunted an innocent-looking teenager
who was busy close by. “I’ll be home
for Christmas, too —in about three
years’ time.” I thought the girl was
kidding. “Gosh, what did you do?
Murder someone!” I joked. The lass
seemed amazed at my lack of recogni-
tion. “Don’t you know me? Don’t
you read the Sunday papers?” she
demanded. I confessed ignorance.
“ ’Strath, they had drawings of me and
everything,” she boasted. “I’m” —her
right hand tapped her inflated chest
proudly—“the Brazen Girl Bandit!” I
did recall the case then —with a young
male tough she had been involved in
bashings that had really earned the
adjectives “brutal” or “despicable,” but
even if they had been applied I’m sure
she would have accepted the condemna-
tion with the same pride, and I’ll
warrant that her Press cutting, with draw-
ing and everything, is her most valued
possession.
* * * *
“Bo”: There being a temporary short-
age of “fights” among famous Hollywood
stars, local gangster feuds and bodgie-
widgie “sensations,” my Sunday rag,
desperate for fill-up blurb, sent a sob-
sister around to interview harassed house-
wives. She painted quite a harrowing
picture. All interviewees agreed that they
were just about at the end of their tether ;
that if the strain of contending against
recurrent shortages and trying to make
ends meet in the face of skyrocketing
food prices were to keep on they would
be threatened with severe nervous break-
downs. And, of course, a photographer
went along to pictorially add the corro-
borative detail which Gilbert claimed
would give artistic verisimilitude to an
otherwise bald (though not unconvincing)
narrative —and ensure at least three
Sabbath sales. I should have expected
to see the trio of harassed housewives
depicted with corrugated brows, bags
under the eyes and the corners of their
mouths drooped like those of sharks. All
were wearing their gayest, widest and
most carefree smile.
* * * *
“Pontius Penwiper”: Every time I
listen-in to a gory description of a prize-
fight a remembrance returns of the time
when Gerald Marr-Thompson, one-time
musical and theatrical critic of the “S. M.
Herald,” got mixed up with boxing. It
was in the days when Bill Lang, by
punching oftener and harder, won a
surprise victory over champion Bill
Squires. By the ethics a new champion
had to be interviewed, and the harassed
editor found that Marr-Thompson was
the only senior man available and asked
him if he would mind doing it. A little
later the music-writer was in Lang’s
dressing-room at the Stadium hearing
the new champ, give a blow-for-blow
description of the fight. Bill brought it
down boastfully to the blow that knocked
Squires rotten and then demanded “What
y’ think of that?” Marr-Thompspn
thought for a moment. “Well,” he said,
“it all sounds very unpleasant.” His inter-
view, however, was very good; a boxing
man told me that it was obviously written
by “a bloke who knows all about the
game.”

THE RIDER IN WHITE
by STUART M'DONALD
THE two men grunted as
they fought; the big man
more than the lean man.
The big man was now re-
ceiving most of the punches ; he
offered the larger target. He
had been menacing at the begin-
ning of the fight, powerful—a
regular bull of a man. But the
sun was now well up in the
sky, and he was feeling the heat.
The dust rose as they fought,
shuffling round in the small
slaughterhouse-yard of Skinner’s
butchery. On the enclosing log-
rail fence an audience of stock-
men perched, watching. Outside
the yard, peering as best they
could between the rails and the
dangling legs of the stockmen,
was the whole of the male popu-
lation of Caboulia Creek.
Numerically this was not large,
but out towards the Gulf a few
can be a crowd.
“Give the knuckle to the
butcher,” urged a stockman
from his perch on the top rail.
This remark coincided with the
impact of a hard straight left on
the big man’s face, and brought
general laughter from the spec-
tators on the fence. The big
man’s nose was bleeding freely.
It was evident that the spec-
tators on the fence were all on
the side of the lighter of the con-
testants, who by his appearance
and clothes was one of them-
selves, and whom they called
Bill. The broad and beefy
gentleman was obviously the
butcher, for tucked up into a
roll around his waist was the
traditional blue-and-white-striped
apron. And his name was
Skinner, for one of his few sup-
porters from outside the yard
called to him by name to “go
in and win.”
But Skinner’s aggressive
rushes had dwindled to futile
pawings as the lighter and
quicker man beat a tattoo on his
ribs and face. The result was
inevitable, and Skinner finally
sprawled on the dusty ground,
his face cut and bleeding, beaten
as much by exhaustion as by the
rain of punches from his
determined opponent.
Not heeding the plaudits of
his friends, the victor pushed
open the gate leading from the
yard and strode away, followed
by his companions, all booted
and spurred, and redolent of the
droving world, to the Carpen-
taria Hotel.
It was in the parlor of the
Carpentaria that the story was
pieced together for the benefit
of a newcomer, unaware that the
scene he had just witnessed was
the final chapter in a fairly long
story,
I T began on the plain near the
1 Koah waterhole when the
Kataranka cows, in charge of
Bill Grant and his men, were
approaching a pleasant journey’s
end for the day.
“Stone the crows!” exclaimed
Grant, after rising in his stirrups
to get a longer view. “Here
we’ve been pushing these cows
along all day to reach the water-
hole and there’s another mob
beatin’ us to it.”
He pointed to a haze of dust
which enveloped a dark moving
mass on the horizon. Through
the windless, sun-drenched air
came to them the familiar sounds
of cattle on the move —the
cracking of a whip, the distant,
hooting shout of a stockman as
he chased and turned a straying
beast into the mob; a faint,
plaintive lowing, the collective
sound of a displaced herd.
“It’d make y’ flamin’ well
sick,” said Tom Finch, Grant’s
offsider. “We’ve drove the poor
cows almost off their feet today
and now, when they get here,
they have to go thirsty. It’ll be
all night before that mob finishes
at the waterhole.”
“We’ll be lucky if our lot gets
a drink at all,” said Grant.
“Ride back, Tom, and tell Frank
that we’ll have to turn our mob
off to the left and hold ’em in
that patch of scrub north-east of
the waterhole and behind the
hill, so as to shut them off from
the scent of the water.”
Finch wheeled his horse and
rode off, back to where another
dust-haze on the north-west
horizon evidenced the approach
of the Kataranka cows.
Grant rode on. His thoughts
were not cheerful. His outfit had
been a month on the road now,
droving down from well up in
the Peninsula. The wet had
come and gone quickly in the
early part of the year. There
had been much thunder and
isolated heavy downpours since
then; but not enough steady
rain in all to keep the stock-
routes in good condition.
He recognised Jack Tracy
from a distance. There was no
mistaking that nuggety figure.
Tracy wore a wide-brimmed
slouch-hat —wider than most;
but without any shape, even in
the crown of it. His grey
flannel bushman’s shirt bellied
loosely from shapeless corduroy
pants which may at one time
have been blue or grey, but
which, from much wearing and
washing, had become an indeter-
minate shade.
“Hello,” each said from a
distance. But they said
nothing else until they were close
to each other, riding knee to
knee, and then only after an
interval.
THEY were in contrast, riding
thus, for Grant was neat
where Tracy was untidy. Grant’s
hat had shape ; his fawn-colored
moleskin pants clung to him,
tightly and neatly tapered into
short top-boots which came up
not far above the ankles.
“Where are you from, Jack?”
asked Grant.
“Somerset Station,” said
Tracy. “Fats for Townsville.”
“How’d you find the track?”
“All right down to the Nardoo
lagoon, but crook after that,”
“How many?”
“Six-hundred. What’ve you
got?”
“Twelve-hundred cows from
Kataranka for Kenmuir.”
“What’re you doin’ over this
far?”
“Brooklyn Creek’s no good—
dried out. Brought them over
here before going on. Thought
I’d give ’em a drink before tak-
ing them on the long, dry
stretch.”
“Wish you weren’t here,”
said Tracy bluntly. “I want this
waterhole all on my own tonight.
I want to water and rest my
bullocks here. There’s no feed
at Caboulia ; you can only give
’em a drink at the paddock
troughs—it’s bore-water at that
.—and shove them into the
trucks. The water and the rest
here means about a stone on
their dressed weight at Towns-
ville.”
“I’d like my cows to get at
that hole by tomorrow morn-
ing,” said Grant.
“I’ll do my best, Long-’un ; but
you see how it is. We haven’t
much time now to sundown.
There’s not much moon, and it’s
going to be a helluva job get-
ting these beeves away from the
waterhole and the mob moving
early in the morning. I’m due
at Caboulia by nightfall to-
morrow. And if our mobs
happened to get mixed up we
might be here sortin’ out the
pieces for days.”
“Yes,” agreed Grant. “You’ve
got it all sized up. And a lot
of my cows are bulling. They’d
start trouble. I’ll have to keep
them over beyond the hill there.
I hope nothing will happen
during the night.”
“There won’t be anything
happenin’,” Tracy assured him.
“We’ll be on the move by day-
light. But if you hadn’t been
in such a hurry ...”
“Pity they haven’t got a chain
of waterholes here,” observed
Grant. “If you’re driving fats
they lose about half a hundred-
weight over that last stretch.”
“They ought to dam some of
these rivers.”
“Damn the city-slickers; they
don’t believe there’s a drought
on while there’s plenty of water
in the ocean.”
GRANT moved back to his
outfit. The large mob of
cows was spread out over the
plain, but stockmen on the
flanks, including a number of
blackboys, were beginning to
compact the loose formation.
Those on the southern flank were
being turned inward, so that the
leaders began to veer north-east
toward the Koah Hill, in the
shadow of which, on the north
side, a sparse scrub grew.
Behind them lumbered the
covered wagon which was used
to carry the calves born on the
way—until such time as they
found their own feet. A
wagonette completed the supply
department of the outfit.
To the south, just a mile or
two beyond the waterhole, ran
a short mountain range, rising to
some height, fertile enough on
its lower slopes to have attracted
to itself an adequate covering of
mulga scrub. A more robust
growth of trees lined the ravines
leading to the summits.
Tracy’s cattle were merging
with the scrub a few miles away,
making toward the waterhole.
A faint scent of the water came
to the cows on a vagrant breeze.
They became fractious and
resisted the turning movement
momentarily. But after much
bellowing, whipcracking, yelling
and galloping, with stockmen
and horses in a flurry of move-
ment, the herd was persuaded
to do the right thing. Snail-like,
reluctantly, the cows disappeared
behind the hill.
Several days without water
and with only scanty patches of
grazing in between made the
Kataranka cows disinclined to
settle down on the rather arid
country near the hill, where a
perverse breeze again brought
the scent of the waterhole to
them.
Said Grant to his offsider,
Finch: “We need water as much
as the cows do. Slip across with
one of the boys and get a couple
of drumfuls from the far end
of the hole. There’s a couple
of little pools there. Tracy will
probably keep his bullocks away
from there so that we can get
some good drinking-water.”
“Right-oh,” said Finch.
Stars were beginning to show
in the pale sky as he and one
of the colored boys rode over
to the Tracy camp, where one
of the outfit already had a fire
going, and the inevitable
blackened billycans were sitting
on the flames.
“Come an’ have some tea,”
said the custodian of the fire.
“I’m just brewing some.”
“It’s water we want,” replied
Finch. “We’re going up to the
small holes at the other end.”
They spurred their horses on
and approached the far end of
the big hole. Tracy’s mob had
rushed the water, and even the
small holes on which they had
depended were clustered round
with thirsty bullocks,
“I’ll be poleaxed,” snorted
Finch. “We’ll be lucky if we
get a clean drink out of this.”
“Pretty terrible, this is,” said
the boy. “Not a fair go, it isn’t.”
“I’ll tell that fellow Tracy off
when I see him,” said Finch as
they led their horses into some
muddy shallows to allow them
to drink. They also managed to
scoop enough passably clean
water to half-fill the drums. But
they were far from satisfied.
They were about to ride off
when Tracy appeared.
“You fellers get some water?”
he queried.
“Yeh! We got some. Bul-
lock-soup I call it. Even the
horses couldn't stomach it,”
burst out Finch.
“Not my fault,” snapped back
Tracy. “I didn’t dry up the holes
further up. We usually use
those for camp water.”
“Not your fault!” growled
Finch. “You could’ve kept that
end clear until we got our water
in. You knew we’d have to fill
up here.”
“I tell you I didn’t know.
But come over to the camp and
you can have some of our water.
We haven’t got much; after all,
you can’t keep six-hundred
thirsty bullocks waiting.”
“Ahrrr ...” grated Finch. “I
hope you look after your bul-
locks. They’ll make such a mess
of that water that our cows
won’t be able to get a drink at
all.”
“Huh,” snorted Tracy. “I
don’t know what you brought
all them cows over here for.
You’re off your beat.”
“It’s a free country,” retorted
Finch. “Since when were you
made the big panjandrum of the
outback? Telling people what
they should do!”
“Come an’ have a drink of
tea, Tom,” said Tracy, placat-
ingly. “Accidents will happen.”
But Finch was not to be
mollified. He had a grievance
and he intended to stick to it.
“To hell with your tea,” he said.
“What we came here for was
water.”
“Get goin’ then,” advised
Tracy. “Back to your cows.”
Finch and his companion
went, muttering unintelligible
remarks that could be inter-
preted as distinct reflections upon
the breeding of certain drovers
and stockmen.
GRANT was annoyed when
Finch told the story. He
had had a trying day, and he
didn’t allow for the fact that
Tom was inclined to be more
than blunt in his conversational
encounters, and caustic in his
comments when crossed.
“Calls himself a drover,” went
on Finch, anent Jack Tracy.
“He ought to be humpin’ his
bluey.”
“When I first met that bloke
up at Burketown,” observed
Grant, “he didn’t know a steer
from a horse.”
The outfit, including three
stockmen, two of them colored
boys and one an aborigine, the
driver of the calf-cart, and one
general offsider, who was cook,
ate in relays. Corned beef from
a small brine-keg had been
cooked the night before, and
went nicely with the damper,
the whole washed down by
copious draughts of strong black
tea, well sweetened.
But they were not at ease, for
a storm was showing up on the
horizon to the north-east. The
sky was invaded with a blue-
black hurrying phalanx of cloud
well armed with forked light-
ning. There was a scurry of
dust as the advance-guard of
the storm arrived. A willy-willy
came spiralling round the camp,
startling the resting cows near
by and picking up sticks and
stones. The air was hot and
oppressive and the dusk retained
the glow of the sunset as if
reluctant to merge with the
night.
"It just won’t happen,” said
Grant. “It’ll blow over. It
always rains somewhere else in
this country, never where you
are.”
Grant and Finch disposed
their team at strategic intervals
in order to prevent a break-
away. The cows were somewhat
nervy, the panic of young calves
contributing a note of anxiety
to the herd. But, as Grant had
predicted, the storm blew over.
And soon its rearguard was
marching over the horizon carry-
ing away its spears of lightning
and its drums of thunder. It
was a bloodless and rainless
victory.
“I hope we can settle down
for the night now,” said Frank.
“I think so,” said Finch. “The
three boys will do the early
watches, and we can help them
out later.”
Tommy and Chappy, the two
half-caste boys, and Jerry, the
aborigine, covered three sides of
the herd’s encampment with
their watches. Was there any
need for watching? The cows
and their progeny had settled
down for the night. The rising
moon revealed no remarkable
movement in the farflung ranks
of the bovine army. The only
sounds were those given by the
contented grazing of a few of
the cows which had found some
vegetation to their liking in the
rather arid ground.
BUT the peace was shortlived.
The three boys agreed on
the details later. A wild screech-
ing and yelling started it all, they
said. Tom Finch said they must
have been asleep and dreamed
it. But they stuck to their story.
The screeching and yelling had
continued, accompanied by the
sound of galloping hooves.
A white-robed figure on
horseback had flashed down the
slope of the hillside. Through
the outskirts of the herd, and
round about, this white rider
went, robe flapping in the breeze,
giving vent to ear-splitting
shrieks. The herd, with its
nerves frayed by a threatened
storm after a long drove on a
hot waterless stretch, was not
slow to move, especially when
the direction of movement
indicated by the yelping, white-
robed figure on horseback led
to a waterhole, as their nostrils
had promised them. The herd
was moving now as one cow.
Blahing calves were pushed
aside, and only the most doting
mothers remained true to their
offspring.
Grant and Finch and the
two others, asleep near the
wagonette, narrowly escaped
being trampled upon by the
rushing herd. It was some time
before they got to their horses,
which were not tractable in the
circumstances, and had fled up
the hillside as the rout took
place. The white men did not
see the banshee-like white-clad
rider who had penetrated the
mob and apparently galloped off
into nothingness.
A jigsaw puzzle would be a
very modest description of the
general composition of the
Kataranka cows during the next
few hours. Tracy and his men
heard the approach of the great
mob and sprang to meet the
offensive. But their bullocks had
had even keener ears than they
had, and were already on the
move. The plain became a run-
ning mass of bullocks and cows.
They overran the waterhole and
fanned out in all directions,
penetrating the mulga scrub
beyond. And the bullocks kept
going into the foothills of the
range.
All night long the two drov-
ing outfits strove to bring order
out of chaos. The morning of
the next day brought some order
to the herds. But it also brought
recrimination. Each team of
men fumed at the stupidity of
the other. All except the boys
who had seen, and sworn to,
the white night-rider.
“What do you think of that!
They let a mob of cows get
away from them,” declared
Tracy. “They ought to be drov-
ing sheep. Goats maybe; but

GUARANTEED NEVER TO FADE OR SHRINK
goafs would be too fast for Bill
Grant and his horsemen.
“A man ought to give the
game away,” said Grant. It
you hadn’t tried to hog the
waterhole all night this wouldn t
have happened.”
Finch, of course, supported
Grant, declaiming to his men
that he had never seen such
shoddy stockmanship as that
exhibited by Tracy and his
men.
BUT there was no time for
actual hostilities between the
two outfits. Tracy’s bullocks
had to be in at the railhead ten
miles away the following day.
Two trains would be waiting at
Caboulia Creek to truck them
over the three-hundred-miles
stretch by rail to Townsville.
Not forbearing in his
language, nor pulling his
punches in his comments on the
Grant and Finch combination,
Tracy summed up his immediate
losses. He was missing twenty-
four bullocks. He must push
on with his mob, and get it de-
livered and trucked. He required
all his men to get them in. He
would come back later, perhaps,
and look around for that twenty-
four.
“And I hadn’t lost a beast up
to the time I met these cows.”
He glared in the direction of
Grant’s men as he said this.
“Yes. A mob of cows,” said
Pat Gallagher, his offsider.
“They must be those- cow-
punchers that play guitars and
ride in jeeps.”
“Stampeded by ghosts,” said
Tracy. He laughed hollowly.
“They’ve even brought the
phantom horseman to life.”
“Did y’ ever hear such
shenanigan!” said Gallagher.
Practically a whole day had
been lost in getting the herds
together. The rail-trucks would
be waiting at Caboulia Creek,
and would be a day behind
schedule in arriving at the meat-
works in Townsville. A meat-
works manager would curse
momentarily and then make
adjustments to his killing pro-
gramme. Railway officials would
swear wildly, declaring that they
could do with these cattle
wagons at some other spot on
the wide cattle front of the
north. Other cattle would be
brought in from stations nearer
to Townsville in order to make
up for the twenty-four-hour
delay in the arrival of the
Somerset bullocks. Otherwise
there would be a day’s gap in the
killing programme.
But to Drover Tracy this was
a very serious personal matter.
The loss of so many bullocks
was a reflection on his droving
ability. Grant had lost only a
couple of old cows and a half-
dozen calves which had been
born since his trip started at
Kataranka. This latter loss
would be felt by old Ginger
Forsayth, the driver of the calf-
cart, who would thus miss some
of the bonuses that accrued to
him from his midwifery duties
with the herd.
SO it was that Tracy, having
got his two trairdoads of
bullocks away from Caboulia
Creek, glowered over his rum
in the parlor of the Carpen-
taria Hotel the following night.
He rumbled and mumbled on the
perverseness of his fellow-
drovers, and the cruel fortune
which pursued good men while
the luck favored the crows.
“A man ought to do them
over,” said Tracy in his cups.
Gallagher agreed. “These
cowboys are lookin’ for it,” he
said. “They must’ve come
straight from the pitchers. Can
you imagine a mob of cows get-
ting away from them? I only
drove a mob of cows once. I’m
jiggered if I could frighten them
into a walk. You couldn’t make
’em run if you fired a cannon at
them.”
“That damn Finch is a nice
feller,” said Tracy sarcastically.
“Sits his horse like a sack of
flour.”
“Yair,” agreed Gallagher.
“That feller’s got too much
yabber. One day he’ll open his
mouth so wide that I’ll . . . ”
“And that feller Grant, with
his tight riding-pants, you’d
think he was a mounted trooper
after the Kelly Gang,” So said
Tracy.
Neither expected for one
moment that they would
immediately be confronted with
the subjects of their conversa-
tion. And possibly if they had
they would not have been so
belligerent. Perhaps the rum
made them more aggressive than
usual. But many a donnybrook
has started by a chance meeting
at the wrong time. And who
should walk into the bar at that
moment but Grant and Finch?
They had left their cows to rest
another day at the waterhole,
and to graze on the foothills of
the range near by. And who
should join them for a drink but
Johnny Squires, the local gossip
and barfly?
“Well, if it isn’t the old Bill
Grant,” he said. “And Tom
Finch. How’re y’, Bill; how’re
y’, Tom? Mine’s a whisky.”
“Still bending your elbow?”
asked Grant. “Seen Tracy
about?”
“Sure. Jack’s around. By
crikey he's wild! Said you
mucked him up at the waterhole
with a mob of cows. He lost
twenty-four-head of bullocks, he
said.”
“He must have lost them him-
self,” said Finch bluntly
“What’s he think we did?
Chase his bullocks away from
him? We had quite enough to
do to look after twelve-hundred
silly cows without looking after
Tracy’s bullocks.”
“You should hear Tracy,” said
Johnny, who dearly loved an
argument and the hostilities that
grew out of them.
Tom Finch was much more
bellicose than he would have
been had he known that Tracy
and Gallagher were in the parlor
within earshot. “A man ought
to push Tracy’s face in,” he said,
although his intentions were
metaphorical rather than
physical.
BUT when the subject of such
implied threats, together
with his right-hand man, Gal-
lagher, loomed like thunder-
clouds in the parlor doorway, a
hush fell on the bar.
“Well. Here we are,” said
Tracy, with an affectation of
jaunty good-humor that deceived
nobody.
“Yes. Here we are,” growled
Gallagher, “Our presence is not
requested, I presume?” He
drew himself up and looked
around the assemblage with such
mock dignity that it could only
be interpreted as a challenge.
There was no answer, so he
went on: “Doesn’t anybody
want to make anything of it?”
This more truculently.
“Behave yourself, Pat,”
laughed Tracy, with rum-
impelled satire. “These herders
of lady bullocks only fight with
their mouths.”
Provoked, Tom Finch placed
himself in front of Bill Grant,
who was, facing Gallagher
grimly. , .
“You’ve been making a lot
of it,” declared Finch to
Gallagher, “yabbering about
your bullocks.”
“Not here, boys, please.
There’s only enough room in the
bar to drink. There’s plenty of
wide-open space outside.” Thus
the publican insinuated, broadly,
that a fight was inevitable.
“Break it down, fellas ; break
it down,” urged Bill Grant.
“This can all be settled peace-
fully over a drink.”
But Gallagher and Finch were
no longer thirsty, and were being
escorted outside by a cluster of
locals who were not disappointed
at such a diversion from
monotony. Apart from the
forty-eight-hour train-service,
Caboulia Creek had been very
quiet for a long time.
The prospective antagonists
were rearing to go ; Gallagher,
in fact, reared quickly and with-
out warning, but missed with a
swinging right. Grant, in try-
ing to stop this premature assault
and to draw attention to the
rules laid down by a defunct
Marquess, was dragged back by
Tracy, who said “Give ’em a
fair go.” As this was just what
Grant was trying to do, he told
Tracy so vehemently.
“It’s on,” said the spectators,
nudging each other. “It’s all
in ; it’s not a private fight.”
It threatened to become an
affair without spectators. Stock-
men, including colored boys
from both outfits, were prepared
to join in. Locals took sides.
Rumors of the impending
conflict had drawn the towns-
folk to the scene, lit only fitfully
from the hotel doorway. Several
hurricane-lamps carried by the
townspeople made eddies of
light in the surrounding
darkness.
But the looming battle was
never joined. The rumble of
galloping hooves was heard.
“Look! Look! A ghost on
horseback,” shrieked one of the
women from the hotel, laughing
hysterically. The whole milling
concourse paused and looked.
The galloping horse came
closer. The rider was sheathed
and hooded in white —sheer
white. The ghostly effect, how-
ever, was dissipated when the
sheeted rider uttered a wild
whoop as he swerved his horse
and scattered the crowd of men
drawn up in fighting array.
Swerving out again, the horse
and its rider rattled off at full
gallop.
The crowd were still standing
agape when Grant found voice:
“After him! On your horses.
That’s the phantom-rider the
boys told us about.”
DROVERS and stockmen
were quickly mounted, and
the pursuit began. The sounds
of the galloping horse ridden by
the white-clad rider were dying
away in the distance. But back
on the clear night air came a
farewelling screech of derision.
Through the night the chase
went on; along the main road
and out into the open paddocks,
across creek beds and around
and over fences; the quarry
balking at no obstacle.
It seemed impossible at first
to catch the white-clad rider, so
much of a start had been given.
But his horse began to tire
suddenly. Its rider took it across-
country, over a split-log fence.
But a few of the pursuers,
anticipating such a move, cut
him off.
“Stand,” said Grant, as he
rode up. “Stand, or I’ll shoot
you off that horse.” This was
bluff. Grant was not carrying
a revolver. But it had the
desired effect. The sheeted rider
gave in.
“All right, boss. Don’t shoot.
I give up the ghost,” came a
voice from the sheet, and the
hood fell down, revealing a
coal-black face.
“Stone the crows,” spluttered
Tracy. “It’s an abo.!”
“What’s the flamin’ game?”
demanded Grant. “Are you the
ghost that stampeded the
cattle?”
“I’m sorry, boss,” said the
aborigine, his wide mouth show-
ing his glistening white teeth in
the moonlight. “I bin drinkin’
rum.”
“Where did you get it from?
“Skinner, the butcher ; he gave
it to me.”
“What for?”
“I tell him how to get some
fat bullocks dirt cheap.”
“Oh, ho! ” chorused the
assembled cattlemen.
“Whadda y’ mean by it, you
black ghost?” demanded Gal-
lagher menacingly.
The aborigine flinched, but
retorted: “Flurry white man
think black man all the time
plurry vegetarian ; promise him
beef-steak pie in the sky when
he die.”
SOME of the men laughed at
this, making Gallagher and
Tracy more hostile to the black.
“Leave him to me,” said
Grant. “I know this boy. He
worked for me once. He was
a good stockman. He was badly
treated on one of the stations
and went bush. He’s been kicked
around ever since. Look, Ben,”
he went on to the black man,
“you don’t want to go to jail, do
you? You’ve heard of Stewart’s
Creek, haven’t you?”
“My word, boss. That’s the
place I’ve been trying to keep
out of all my life.”
“What did you do this for?”
“We wanted some beef. The
other myalls and me. We make
camp in the hills. I run in a
horse, a bit of a brumby. I
borrow a sheet in town from
Skinner the butcher. He
promise me plenty of rum if I
show him where to find some
bullocks for nothing.”
“You’ve got Tracy’s bullocks
up in the gorge then?”
“Yes, boss. We got twenty;
but we kill one off for beef.”
“Lead the way, Ben. We want
those bullocks.”
And Ben led the way up
beyond the waterhole, through
the ravines to a little
plateau in a fold of the hills
contained the little camp of the
myalls, wayward nomads from
mission-stations and cattle-runs.
Here for a brief moment they
had given the horse-laugh to the
civilisation that had dispossessed
them of their hunting-grounds
and their freedom.
THE erring blacks were given
a fair time to get going,
after Tracy had used them to
collect his bullocks.
“The police will round them
up soon enough,” insisted Grant.
“Yes. Let the poor blighters
go,” growled Tracy at last, after
threatening to flay them alive.
“They don’t sleep on beds of
roses, do they!”
“But we have an appointment
in town with a man named
Skinner,” said Grant.
Tracy’s face brightened up
immediately. “You’ve said it,”
he retorted. “But it’s not we, it’s
me. I want him for my very
own,”
“I’ll toss you for him,” said
Grant, taking out a penny and
spinning it in the air.
And that’s how Bill Grant
came to fight Mr. Skinner, the
butcher, in the slaughterhouse-
yard.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Gulliver”: Looking at recent photo-
graphs of rodeo “stars” in their hybrid-
Hollywood-cowboy outfits set me think-
ing of the stockmen in from the Gulf
who paraded Townsville’s Flinders-street
40 years ago. There was splendor for
you! Silk shirts —with vertical, inch-and-
a-half wide stripes of chocolate and green,
or mauve and crimson, ascending the
collar —were worn with made-up bow-
ties of even greater brilliance. The coats,
cut on the ample lines of 1912, came
half-way to the knees ; the lapels ended
below the waist, with eight or 10 (the
more the smarter) closely-set buttons and
buttonholes below; fancy ran riot on the
curves of cuffs and pocket-flaps, both
lavishly bebuttoned and completing about
12 quids’-worth of blue-twill tailoring.
Green pegtop gaberdine strides descended
to lace-up boots of the now-forgotten
ox-blood shade, with richly curving knob
toes and Cuban heels. Crowning all this
glory was a hat of the heaviest black
velour, as richly furred as a winter
possum, cocked slightly over one eye.
The whole lot cost real money in die
days when stationhands got three quid a
week and keep, and I suppose “pretty
sharp” would be the term for it today.
But inside all the magnificence was a
real man who didn’t need fancy shirts
and pants to ride a rough-’un—and those
rough-’uns bucked for the hell of it,
any time of day, and not because there
was a flank rope around them.

“Emjai”: If “Dee Dee” (B. 16/4/’52)
is immune to the poison of bee-stings he
might try himself out with the northern
Victorian bullants and settle our argu-
ment as to which of them delivers the
most poignant thrust. In our belt of
bush we have the
three common
varieties of the
big fellows. The
black - and - golds,
like O.S. sugar-
ants, come in
sizes up to nearly
two inches, and
though slower
than the others,
pack a 50-bfee-
power punch.
Well may they,
of some previous occupation. The Japs
have been mentioned, but there’s
another explanation. The main island,
Hermit, was used during the pearl-
ing boom of the first quarter of the
century as a foul-weather base for a
pearling fleet whose headquarters were in
Onslow. During the willy-willy season,
from about November to January, any-
thing up to 100 men might have been
camped on that island while their luggers
sporting Richmond’s football colors, echo
die cry of “Eat ’em alive. Tigers! ” The
“Maroons,” a little smaller but active and
aggressive, square off like any Fitzroy
ruckman. And lastly, the “All Blacks.”
They don’t know Australian Rules, and
they back up like a Border ram and jump
at you. Sam knew all about them and
voted for the “Tigers.” Kneeling on an
old log he pointed out a nest of them
behind it. “They’re the boys,” he said.
“Real Captain Bloods. If they get their
nips into y’ ” Then there was a yell
and he was out of the barrier. When we
caught up with him he was dragging off
his pants, and stuttered: “S-see what I
mean? N-no ant ’cept a ‘Tiger’ c-can
bite like that.” While someone dug up
a whisky we explored his rammies and
found the still-fighting “All Black,”
which had tackled from the rear. And
now Sam’s not so sure,

sheltered in the lagoons. It was a good
laying-up spot, and one of the best fishing
grounds around the coast. Just off the
islands there’s a spot known as the Monte
Bello Deeps, where the old Norwegian
whalers made their best kills. A mate
of mine once saw six whales killed in
one morning, and their inflated bodies left
drifting with the company’s flag flying
from their carcasses. Mary Ann Passage,
between the group and the mainland,
used to be a good spot for baroque, a
poor-quality pearl which nevertheless
was worth collecting where plentiful.
However, sharks made divers chary of
work in M.A.P.

“Pip Tok”: The Monte Bello Islands,
off the n.-w. coast of Australia, provide
a link between atomic warfare and the
Napoleonic Age. The small cluster of
rocky islets was discovered by Flinders’s
contemporary, Nicholas Baudin, who,
despite the fact that Britain and France
were at war, was allowed to continue his
explorations in Australian waters. Baudin
named the group after Napoleon’s
Marshal Lannes, a hard-fighting Gascon
whom the Emperor had created Duke of
Monte Bello as a reward for his victory
near that north Italian town. Lannes
himself was a victim of the use of high-
explosives in war ; he died after a cannon-
shot had torn off a leg during the
Wagram campaign.

“Mat’s Mate”: “There’s some blokes,”
Mat said, “would get up an’ walk a
hundred miles north if anythin’ like work
showed in the south ; there’s others would
go through anythin’ t’ get a job. Then
y’ get the bloke that’s never satisfied.
He’s got a good job in, say, Wagga an’ a
bloke drifts in from Cobar or somewhere
talkin’ about the big money up there an’
the bloke in Wagga snatches his time an’
heads f’r Cobar. Then y’ get the looker.
He’s always goin’ somewhere t’ look at a
job, though he never seems to take one.
Well, I reckon it takes all sorts t’ make a
world, as the feller says, but y’ can bet
your life he never knew how many sorts
it took. Look at Bally Simpson. He
was a bloke always did a good day’s job
an’ was proud of it. He got the sack
once an’ it ruined him. Hurt his pride
so deep he stopped smilin’ an’ he got so
scared of gettin’ the sack he always got
in first. He’d get goin’ on a job, be sweet
with the boss an’ everythin’ jonick, then
he’d go t’ the boss an’ say, ‘l’m finished.’
‘What’s wrong?’ the boss’d say. ‘Nothin’,’
Bally’d say, ‘l’m just makin’ sure y’ don’t
sack me.’ Yair, it got t’ be one o’ them
obsessions with poor old Bally.” “What
happened to him?” I asked. “Nothin’
much,” Mat said. “He don’t work at all
now. Reckons that’s the best way to beat
the sack.” 10 .v
“Dee”: I can’t swallow “Long Bob’s”
curlew (B. 23/4/’52) with its “ability to
vary” the color of its egg in different
country. In effect, the bird would thus
be capable of (a) an intelligent recogni-
tion of colors ; (b) an appreciation of the
danger involved in laying the wrong-
colored egg; and (c) the capacity by an
& ct of will of determining a change in a
biological process going on within it-
self. This “adaptation to environment,”
especially in terms of color, is common
enough in nature, but surely its explana-
tion lies in some mechanistic reaction to
the new surroundings, as, for instance, a
diet containing components of the new
color-pattern. “Ability to vary” might
be right enough for a royal-commission
witness, but not for a curlew.
* * * St
“Old Camp”: That Newdegate (W.A.)
farmer with his home built of beer-bottles
(B. 26/3/’52) is by no means the first to
use dead-marines as building material;
in 1899 I saw in Boulder (W.A.) a house
of two rooms built of them, though in
that case the binding cement was mud.
And there was a beautiful finale to this
home, too, A few years later, with three
breweries busy suppressing the goldfields’
thirst, beer bottles took on a measure of
value. So, the original builder-owner hav-
ing departed, a couple of Boulder-Block
habitues demolished the building, cleaned
the bottles, sold them to a newly-
established bottle-oh: and so obtained
money with which they were able to buy
BEER. At the time there seemed to be
some sort of poetic balance about it.
* * * Sic
“Fairf”: Visiting the coastal district
around Malabar and La Perouse (N.S.W.)
about five years ago, I was interested in
the call of a strange bird. A musical,
liquid run of three or four notes, it
suggested, I thought, a species of the
smaller parrots. My question as to the
bird responsible for the sound brought a
surprised: “Don’t tell me you’ve never
heard a starling before! ” I certainly had ;
and I’d seen flocks which, without exagger-
ation, numbered thousands —but they
didn’t have a call like that. * My host
pointed out the bird to me —about the
build of the “stark” if a size
smaller; but it wasn’t black! Not
even that brown speckled color that
seems to indicate young-’uns and
hens before the moult. These alleged
starlings were a greyish color with a line
of white along the folded wings and a
thin white bar above both eyes. Perhaps
they were a different species of starling,
but my host found it hard to believe that
I’d never seen the birds before, while I
couldn’t believe that he didn’t know the
common, green-sheened black bloke.
Anyway, they are extending their hunt-
ing grounds: Merry lands is about 20 miles
inland from Malabar, and yesterday —
for the first time in the 30-odd years I’ve
known the locality—l saw a pair of the
strangers there. It’s to be hoped that this
newcomer doesn’t become such a head-
ache to backyard orchardists as the pretty
little cove who first turned up about 17
years back —the bul-bul.

“Kultahna”: If “H.C.8.” had been
lucky enough to hear the girls from the
aboriginal settlement (B. 16/4/’52) refer
to the female of the species, he would
have added another lesson to those learnt
on that day. For they would certainly not
have called a lubra a “gin.” There is
really nothing strange in their acceptance
of the term “blackfellow.” It is simply
a descriptive noun, the same as white-
fellow. A male abo. is a blackman, black-
feller or munga ; a woman is a woman
or lubra. In their native environment they
accept their color and certainly are not
conscious of inferiority. It is only when
uplifters assure them of their equality
with whites that they feel inferior. I am
with them in their dislike of the terms
“nigger” and “gin.” It’s surely easy and
right to show them that elementary
courtesy.
* * * *
“Rooster”: Not all cockroaches are
winged (B. 23/4/’52). For a long time
it puzzled entomologists why, in one
family of the pests, some would be wing-
less and others one-winged. They remove
one another’s wings by biting them off,
doubtless because wings are an encum-
brance under logs, etc., their natural
habitat. There are*about 1000 species,
each with distinctive habits, but it is sig-
nificant that most of them have a flat-
tened, oval body and slender legs that
enable a rapid retreat through the nearest
crack.
* * * *
“Cliff Towers”: I’ve a nostalgic interest
in the camp-oven discussion —the best
bread I’ve ever tasted was made in one,
and the big secret was to punch a few holes
in the bottom of an empty baking-powder
tin, which was then placed upside-down
in the centre of the oven before the
dough went in. This was supposed to let
the steam escape from the bottom of the
loaf. The camp-oven also produced
roasts, fried chops, stews, fricassees and
puddings; and a Jap cook we once had
in a nor’-west mustering camp used to
make the most delicious flaky pastry in
one—or perhaps a day in the saddle
chasing sheep over Westralia’s scrub-
covered sandhills made it taste that way.
Living now in civilisation, I’ve since tried
to produce a damper in an electric range,
but thermostats and top and bottom
elements “high for an hour and low for
20 minutes” don’t seem half as exact as
a quick look, a rap with the knuckles,
and the decision that “another shovelful
of coals should just about do her.” There
are still some things for which science
has po substitute —and, furthermore,
camp-ovens don’t have blackouts. But
if they are unobtainable, what do
musterers’ and drovers’ cooks cook in
these days?

TUMBLEWEED.
Time for tumbleweed is the centre of storm;
For this sun darkens,
Road is a torrent of sand.
From Mallee to Wimmera farms are feathered
with wind,
Cower for flight;
Fences and walls go down
So that tumbleweed may dance,
And wind beats time on the crops—alien barley
and wheat.
Moving on a torrent of sand
From Ouyen to Pinnaroo,
From Panitya some place else—
Some corridor of dead and flying weed —
For tumbleweed this skeletal dan,ce is life.
A shrouded sun is time for departure,
And arrival is rest under the lee of fences,
Lodgment in the pitted shelters of the plain,
Until a rain—
Riding the ancient battle of the storm —
Blinds from yesterday with wet, red arrows,
And in the morning there is green again.
For the salmon gives his youth to the sea,
And time for a woman is seeding-time
And the thrust of winter’s certainty.
But tumbleweed, the wiser, being dead,
Comes back to life when dust is rising red—
Changing through unchanging change,
Spinning with the world.

“Prof.”: In at least one case it is a
blackfellow’s version of a “white-fellow
name” that survives (B. 16/4/’52).
Captain Cook named Cape Howe back
in April, 1770; and early whalers and
other voyagers round that corner referred
to a near-by piece of red granite and
scrub as “Cape Howe Island.” Usually
there were one or two natives as pilots
and general hands on the coastal boats
of the time, and it is from their refer-
ences to “Cape ’Owe Island” that we
derive the present name of Gabo Island.
“Tommy Bar”: If “Bohemian” (B.
16/4/’52) reports correctly, surveyors
must do things differently in Maoriland.
Here in Australia we frown on the prac-
tice of hanging coats and vests on the
“eyepiece end” of the theodolite, as we
consider it would be detrimental to the
telescope and its mountings. Nor do we
entirely approve of using any of the
bits and pieces which project from a
theodolite as coathangers. I’ve given up
trying to work out how the object lens
can be made to face the sun which ought
to be somewhere overhead at lunch-time
and at the same time face the bull which
normally would be expected to be at
ground-level. And what sort of a nitwit
would go away and leave his theodolite
standing in the middle of a bull-paddock?
That bloke wouldn’t get a job here as a
surveyor—not even in a Government
department.
* * * *
“Eurimburra”: Though the recent
good rains have brought a nice stand of
rye and clover, the most attractive titbit
for stock and rodent alike is that noxious
weed the sweet-briar, The cows are
taking the seed-pods
and the sheep have
eaten the leaves for
as high up as they
can reach, leaving
nothing, it seemed,
for the hares. One
big red bloke, how-
ever, was not to be
beaten. He tried one
or two briars stand-
ing on his tip-toes,
but found nothing
edible, so moved to
several growing
through the remains of an old
post-and-rail fence. A nice show on
one briar near a post that still carried a
bottom rail to the next attracted him.
He tried but couldn’t reach the leaves;
then, with the certainty of a Blondin, he
hopped on to the rail, steadied with his
forepaws against the post, and, drawing
himself up to his full height, got to work.
I reckon he deserved them.
* * * *
“Cham”: No crop of surveyors’
errors (B. 9/4/’52) anywhere in
Australia produced a richer harvest than
that which, with a mixture of tape-
stretching and “pacing it off,” marked
out the leases on the birth of Westralia’s
Golden Mile, Discovered by Brookman
and Pearce, the Great Boulder was the
first of the leases. And as the others
were pegged out, half hilariously—for
who coufd have dreamt that underfoot
lay the richest cubic-mile of auriferous
ground this earth has yet known —no
one cared too much as to the accuracy of
comer-pegs marking out what were re-
garded largely as “wildcats.” But when
the Great Boulder turned out to be a
startling gold-producer—in 1895, within
two years of the discovery of Hannans,
it had, with only 10 head of stamps,
produced 26,663 ounces of gold—a
general measuring-up of areas took place.
With the Great Boulder as a centre, tapes
went out in all directions, and it was
found that where the Great Boulder
joined the Associated, the South Kalgurli,
the Perseverance and others of little im-
portance to the south there remained a
small oblong, less than an acre of no-
man’s-land. Getting the “wheeze” early,
a rough-diamond from the Auld Sod,
by name of Bourke, took this up. But
even Bourke didn’t realise he had a
bonanza: he sold building-sites for quite
moderate sums. In its prime the Boulder
Block, otherwise “The Dirty Acre,”
carried six hotels, all except Bourke’s of
brick or stone ; three restaurants, grocers,
butchers, electric-light plant, and every
other possible business, not forgetting
straight “gaffing” shops where a mug
could be parted from his “roll” by a
process practically painless. With the
mines paying in wages tens of thousands
fortnightly, with prospectors still coming
in with full “chammys,” with gold so
plentiful below that a miner might stroll
home with £5O- or £lOO- worth of ore
in his billy, the Block was a businessman’s
dream come true: three years of last
century; ten of this. And if it hadn’t
been for careless surveying in the be-
ginning it wouldn’t have been there; the
flood of spending-silver would have gone
to Kalgoorlie, three miles away, or to
Boulder City, a mile in another direction
—though, as it was, neither of those towns
had anything to complain of.
* * * *
“Old-timer”: It’s ostriches now—wild
ones chasing the inhabitants of the South
Australian Coorong. That’s not far north
of the Tantanoola tiger’s country, and
the ornithological myth will apparently
join the tiger, the Clarence crocodile, the
Junee reindeer, the Lake Dynevor bunyip
and all the other curiosities which
from time to time have intrigued the city
newspapers and sent bands of bushmen
scouring the countryside armed to the
back teeth. The Coorong apparition con-
fronted a chap who was riding
through Campbell Park station and
who “noticed an ostrich with three chicks.
Suddenly the bird let out a shrill cry and
almost immediately a male ostrich
charged out of the bush and made for
me. I shot through as fast as I could.”
Evidently his steed had the legs of the
bird, though it is credited with being as
fast as a racehorse, and he got away in
one piece. Adelaide “ Tiser,” reporting
the occurrence, notes that about 60 years
ago there was an ostrich-farm in the
locality and that when demand for their
plumes died out they “ran wild in the
Coorong area.” It further reports that
they are “twice as big as the local emus,”
Cripes!
* * * *
“Edx”: The tallest tree ever recorded
on the W.A. goldfields (B. 2/4/’52) was
a salmon-gum, growing recently (it may
still be there) not far from Kalgoorlie.
Though many must have seen this tree
standing quite near the road, it remained
unnoted until, not many years ago, a
visiting surveyor happened to measure it.
He found that it was 53ft. high, that is,
above the level of the flat surrounding
country, and also he noticed that it was
growing in a shallow depression about
6ft, square. Inquiring of an aged pros-
pector who had lived in the district many
years, he discovered that the depression
was all that showed of an old mine-shaft,
which had, however, only been filled in
a few years before as a public benefit,
after a citizen trying to embrace the tree
one night had fallen down the shaft. Yes,
the tree must have grown up from the
bottom of the shaft, and a search through
old mining records revealed that the shaft
had been abandoned at a depth of 60ft.,
thus making the true or corrected height
of the tree not less than 113 ft., which,
for a salmon-gum, is pretty tall.
* * * *
“Kelms”: You can’t always gauge the
distance away of lightning by the space
between flash and thunder (B. 16/4/’52).
Looking for the horses one night out
from Southern Cross (W.A.) I got mixed
up with an electric storm. The flashes
were almost incessant, so that an eerie
blue light hung over the rock outcrop
on to which I’d wandered. But the
impression that has remained most vivid
is that of the complete silence. There
wasn’t a breath of wind nor a suspicion
of thunderclap, though you could feel
the thunder in the air. Can’t say whether
there was a low cloud over the outcrop;
the display must have been caused by a
discharge between earth and a low-lying
accumulation of static electricity, but that
doesn’t necessarily imply a cloud. An
accumulation can exist in dry air. An
example of this is the fireball, which is
simply a globular form of lightning with
peculiar manifestations. An electrician
told me he once saw a fireball as
big as a football enter a house by the
front-door, move down the passage about
3ft. from the floor, and pass out through
the back-door. He thinks that if it had
been touched, or if both doors had not
been open, an explosion would have
occurred. He’s frequently been called to
investigate shocks which have been re-
ceived from clotheslines, and which he
knows are caused simply by accumula-
tions of static electricity passing from the
lines to earth through the body of the
first person to touch them. You’ll some-
times get a slight shock as you touch
the framework of a bus that has travelled
far between stops on a cold, clear morn-
ing. The passage of the bus through the
dry air generates electricity, which can’t
flow to earth through the rubber tyres.
That’s the reason why petrol-wagons drag
a chain beneath the chassis, so that the
chain drains away the stored electricity
which could otherwise create a dangerous
spark. These examples of “miniature”
lightning involve only small voltages,
although a kick from a clothesline may
be painful; but in the case of the
electrical storm I mentioned the voltages
must have been high to produce such
vivid flashes. I’m still curious to know
“ Well , that sale fell through."
if I was in any danger at the time, and
why the discharges were noiseless.
# « * *
“Colonial Cove”: Binghi’s medical
knowledge (B. 2/4/’52)? Take the
modern use of tannin-extract for burns.
Binghi used kino, the gum of the red-
gum, for that purpose, as well as for
spear- and other battle-wounds. Kino is
so full of tannic aci'd that it makes a
first-class tanning agent for fishing-nets,
and anything that is exposed to salt-
water or the weather. It is also a power-
ful antiseptic. Again, if credence be
given to chroniclers of the 1830’s, the
aboriginal of the south-west of W.A. had
a quite modern treatment for snakebite:
the placing of a ligature between the
punctures and the heart, scarifying with
a sharp stone, followed by sucking. It
may seem incredible that Binghi had an
inkling of the circulation of the blood,
but not so much when one realises how
large a part the flow of human blood
played in his primitive tribal ceremonies.
It is common knowledge that he was
accustomed to tightly ligature an arm or
a leg in order to induce swollen veins,
from which on puncture a copious flow
could be produced. The use of the liga-
ture in one direction may have led to a
practical use in the case of snakebite.
* * * *
“Sou’-west”: Blown inshore by a
sudden terrific gale, our 30-footer was
washed right out when we were swamped
in the surf, including all our fish and
what little tucker we carried. We were
desperately hungry after a few hours ; we
were 25 miles from the nearest port and
store, and there wasn’t even a dead crab
on the beach. Then, in a rocky cove
right where we could get at them, we
found a harvest of mussels ; but we still
had no boiler to cook them in. Salvaging
a leaky kero.-tin that had been used to
hold bait, old Sam flattened it into a
plate. Perched on two fair-sized stones,
and with a fire of driftwood underneath,
it became a hot plate. On top Sam spread
about an inch of wet sand, then an inch
of seaweed, then a layer of mussels, an-
other of weed, followed by another of
mussels —six layers altogether, with a
covering of big-leafed kelp over all. Soon
everything began to steam. “When they
open they’re done,” Sam advised. They
were, too. Big mussels, steaming hot,
cooked in their own juice: and with the
bottom shell still swimming with it,
Sam’s way of cooking mussels may be
common enough, but it was the first time
we had struck it. When mussels are
boiled in a pot they open and lose their
liquor, but steamed in the shell —that
liquor is one of the richest-tasting things
that come out of the sea.
♦ * ♦ ♦
“Eurimburra”; The goshawk came in
from a low-level position that hid him
from the pair of spags gossiping in a small
boxthorn. Coming to earth behind
another boxthorn a few feet away, he was
peering around this to size things up,
but stuck his neck out a shade too far
and the chatterers spotted him. As their
chirping changed to loud squeaks of
abuse the hawk, flashing from the ground,
wheeled and banked over their sanctuary
in an effort to flush them, but they sat
tight, and the hawk dropped to the ground
alongside, ran underneath, and looked up
at them. The spags shifted to the top.
Round the hawk came again, but the
expected meal promptly slid back into the
middle. So the grim pantomime went on
till the exasperated goshawk plunged
blindly into the thorny harborage. Im-
mediately the spags dropped to the
ground, watched him floundering
around, then flitted to the next tree.
The hawk struggled out and, lighting on a
post, examined himself for spikes. He
was digging at his shirt-front when a
venomous crack exploded just above his
nut, then another as two magpies dived
at him. I could hear the vicious snap-
ping of their bills 30 yards away. That
exposed post was no place for the
goshawk. He set out in disgust for the
river.
MEMORY.
Roads and places, voices and faces,
Laughter, swallow on the rafter.
A dog’s distant bark,
And someone whistling in the dark.
Summer hours, bush flowers,
Rabbits up logs, dams and frogs.
Northwind blowing, bushfire glowing,
And Mother sighing, then crying.
Dried-up grasses, rocky passes,
Purples and greys of golden days.
Drought, and the water run out.
Knells of bullock-bells,
Campfires, teams and dreams.
The cane, snakes, bellyaches,
Whitlows, boils, thieving, spoils.
The old creek-bed, mullock-heaps red,
The cradle, the dish and the wish.
Birds on the wing and the songs they sing.
Swaggies with flies in their eyes.
The gloom of a darkened room,
Eyes burning white,
And sandy blight.

NEW JAP ARMY.
“On the broad lines of its
policy to Japan America is
clearly right. There can be no
stability in the Far East unless
Japan stands on its own feet
and plays the part of a Great
Power. But the present Cabinet
in Tokyo, which is relatively
easy to work with, cannot last
for ever. What will happen
afterwards?”
“Manchester Guardian” further
comments on the dilemma:
“To put any restraints on
Japanese nationalism may be to
drive it to ally itself with the
Communist Powers. On the
other hand, to work with it may
be to foster terrible forces of
wildness which may once again
cause havoc.”
The rearming is already sweep-
ing on; London “Times’s”
Tokyo correspondent reports
that the Jap National Police
Reserve is “rapidly assuming
the characteristics of a new
Japanese Army.”
Its official strength, the corres-
pondent says, is 75,000, and it
includes former Imperial Army
officers up to the rank of colonel.
“The National Police Reserve
(N.P.R.) is equipped with heavy
machine-guns, rocket-launching
bazookas, and field mortars.
During the next fiscal year, the
Government’s budget will pro-
vide for an increase in this
carefully selected corps, bringing
it up to 110,000. Recruiting is
expected to begin in September.
“It is believed that there are
Government plans for the ex-
pansion of the N.P.R. to 310,000
within the next two years. This
prospective figure would be
80,000 more than the strength of
the Japanese standing army in
1930, just before the invasion of
Manchuria.”
As to the widely expressed
fears of America’s Jap policy,
the “Times” man believes it will
probably be aimed at ensuring
that Japan is militarily dependent
on the United States for air and
naval components. “Further-
more, the suspicions of
America’s other allies in the Far
East concerning Japanese inten-
tions must be taken into account
by Washington policymakers in
determining the limits to which
Japan’s military power shall be
reborn.”
U.S. in Formosa.
Anticipating likely attacks on
America’s Formosan policy
“from quite different quarters,”
the authoritative “New York
Times” has been at pains to state
carefully just what that policy
ist
“The United States has de-
ployed the Seventh Fleet in
Asiatic waters to guarantee that
Formosa does not become a
military part of the action in
Korea. That policy is called one
of ‘neutralising’ Formosa. We
[U.S.A.] have, in the meantime,
sent a military mission to For-
mosa to assist in the training and
equipment of the Nationalist
troops that are garrisoning the
island.
“It has been stated repeatedly,
in both political and military
circles [in the U.S.], that the
function of this mission is a
purely defensive one. We are
not laying the foundation for an
all-out attack on the Chinese
mainland, supported logistically
and in the field by the United
States. We are, on the other
hand, undertaking to make con-
siderably more formidable the
defences of the island in both
manpower (Chinese) and equip-
ment.
“This is giving effect to what
has been clearly stated as an
American appraisal of the Asiatic
situation, both political and
military. We have declared, at
the highest levels, that the main-
tenance of Formosa in friendly
hands is essential to the stability
of the Pacific and the security of
the United States. It is a bastion
that flanks our positions in
Okinawa to the north and the
Philippines to the south. It is
agreed that the loss of this For-
mosan position would break the
arc of our Pacific defence. On
this ground, therefore, the United
States will oppose any ‘settle-
ment’ that involves turning For-
mosa over to any hostile or
potentially hostile Power.
“Formosa is a position that
we can defend, and we have
stated that we propose to do so.
It is unlikely that we can retreat
from such a commitment in the
course of further ‘negotiation.’ ”
Russia-China Link.
There is not, in London
‘'Times’s” view, any chance of
the Soviet-Mao link snapping,
not even to please the wishful.
“There may,” it editorially
comments, “be disputes between
the two allies. Certainly there
are plenty of signs of hard
bargaining at every stage. Any
friction that there may be, how-
ever, counts for nothing when
measured against their supreme
community of interest in the
present world crisis.
“Russia, with her plans for
extending Communism in
Europe now at a standstill, sees
her interests served by the pro-
motion of Communist and
nationalist revolts in Asia.
China’s immediate interests fit
in entirely with Russia’s. How
far she is merely intent to
establish buffer States between
herself and United States power
in the Far East (as Russia has
established them in Eastern
Europe) or how far she is bent
upon the (immunisation of all
Korea and all South-East Asia
cannot be said with certainty.
“Probably the answer will
depend on China’s calculation of
the forces against her; but,
short-term or long-term, her
designs coincide with the
Russians’.”
Malayan Mirage.
“It is essential to realise that
talk about a real Malayan
nation, compact of Malays,
Chinese and Indians, is apt to
obscure the utter impossibility
of welding these discordant and
culturally conflicting races into

BIZ BAD AT THE MATRIMONIAL BUREAU.
one coherent nation within the
short space of time so frequently
suggested.”
Writing in London “Daily
Telegraph,” Lord Milverton
sees the time needed as nothing
less than a generation, and great
danger in acting on the assump-
tion that the mirage of unity is
a reality.
Britain, he points out, has
pledges and treaties of long-
standing to honor with the
Malays, whose ancestral home
is the country in dispute, and
now has pledges and promises
to the Chinese.
“Both of these races,” he in-
sists, “must develop a sense of
realism over the circumstances
of today, and be willing to co-
operate on a basis of equality—
economic, social and political.
Only those who know Malaya
can realise fully what a revolu-
tion of thought and outlook that
will entail.
“Is is no service to the future
of Malaya to ignore or gloss
over the sacrifices both sides
must be willing to make for a
common ideal. Nor to forget
the religious difficulties in addi-
tion to the political, social and
economic difficulties.
“In the meantime, an open
rebellion by the Chinese Com-
munist party of Malaya has to
be dealt with, and no real pro-
gress towards self-government
can be made until that rebellion
is crushed. This means the
break-up of the Min-Yuen, the
subversive Chinese secret society,
as well as the defeat of the rebels
in the field, whom they support
with men, money, food and arms.
“Is it too much to insist that
Government must be able to
function and to re-establish
security before it can sensibly
begin to surrender its functions
to other hands?”
Uncle Sam, Freetrader.
The European complaint that
Uncle Sam thinks trade should
all flow in one direction —from
him out —is backed up by the
“Atlanta Journal,” contending
that America’s allies could do
much more for themselves (and
hence need less from Uncle) by
selling America civilian goods of
many kinds, if America would
let them:
“Trade policies which served
us [U.S.A.] well as a small debtor
nation, building its own indus-
tries, will not work now that we
are the world’s largest creditor
nation with a stake in the
economic well-being of every
people with which we are asso-
ciated.
“The British built their world
economic leadership of the last
century, a leadership to which
we have now succeeded, on rela-
tively free trade. They welcomed
the products of every nation in
return for what Britain could
most effectively supply.
“Trade is a two-way street.
Only when we are willing to
buy from others, as well as to
sell and give away our own
goods, will our business relations
with the world be on a sound
basis.”
“Milwaukee Journal” in the
same vein:
“The United States does a lot
of talking about the need for
Europe to get dollar balances, to
increase exports and to manu-
facture more. That’s fine, too.
The Netherlands happily started
exporting cheese—and the United
States put limitations on cheese
imports in no time, because it
didn’t want competition for its
own cheese. Now Dutch manu-
facturers, urged to produce to
sell abroad, are apt to shrug and
say:
“ ‘What’s the use—as soon as
we produce enough to export,
the United States will put on
limitations or raise the tariffs
so we can’t sell for dollars.’ ”
Various Voices.
Clement Attlee: “It is my
faith that, if we can prevent
another world war, time is on
our side, for I think that funda-
mentally Russian Communism
is a creed that runs counter to
human nature.”
Britain’s Labor ex-Chanceilor
of the Exchequer, Gaitskell:
“Some believe the danger of a
major war has diminished. I
very much hope so. But if this
is the case I believe it to be due
primarily to the growing military
strength of the Western demo-
cracies and, above all, of the
United States, The Russians
will not move unless they think
there is a chance of quick victory.
The stronger we are the less
chance they have of that. This
is no argument against rearma-
ment. It is, on the contrary, its
overwhelming justification.”
American General Bradley,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff: “America [in Korea] has
felt like a fighter who does not
really have enough room to
swing. We have withheld what
Americans consider their ‘Sunday
punch’—the atomic bomb —
because strategic bombing to be
effective must be aimed at the
source of supply. And we all
know that the main source of
Communist supply is not in
China.”
U.S. Atomic Chief, Gordon
Dean: “We do not welcome
this arms race, and we would
much rather it didn’t exist. But
it does exist, and as long as it
goes on we think it is the hope
of the free world that we stay in
the lead.”
Truman : “The final solution
for the ills that plague the world
can never lie in armies and
navies and air forces. The final
solution cannot be reached until
all nations are willing to live to-
gether in peace. The final victory
cannot be won until the truth
has made all people free.”
Tito: “I still believe that the
international controversies now
hanging in the air will eventually
be settled peacefully. Perhaps
the settlement will be such that
it will not fully satisfy either
side, but even that would be
better than a war.”
A nth ony Eden : “The
Germans themselves do not want
a national army. Nor do they
want the revival of old forms
of German nationalism and
militarism. What we all want
is that Germany should play her
part in a unified Europe, where
decisions are taken together.
This is an objective which can
threaten no one, and we should
not allow ourselves to be
diverted from it.”
Dr. W. P. D. Logan, chief
medical statistician of Britain’s
General Register Office: “The
situation is now being reached
—a situation scarcely dreamed of
in 1940, when the immunisation
campaign started —where the
eradication of diphtheria as an
indigenous disease in Britain
can be foreseen as a very real
possibility within the next few
years, provided there is no
slackening in the immunisation
efforts that have been so dram-
atically successful in the past 10
years.”

"LOHENGRIN."
SUNDRY SHOWS
It was a boldly imaginative
move for an entirely home-
grown opera company to open
its Sydney season with Wagner
—whose works haven’t been
produced professionally in that
city for half a lifetime —instead
of the traditional “Aida” ; and
the step paid good artistic
dividends when N.S.W. National
Opera took the plunge at the
Tivoli last week.
Most striking was the advance
made in the purely technical
aspects of production since this
concern got into its stride last
year. “Lohengrin” is a severe
test, and it says much for the
work of Carl Randell and the
musical direction of Joseph Post
that it ran from curtain to
curtain with oil-bath smooth-
ness. Inadequate though the
Tiv. stage may be, wonders were
performed in chorus-dispersal.
The chorus, which lacked
animation in the opening
sequences, made up for it later
with some finely - disciplined
work, always strong in attack
—the cramped setting of the
bridal-chamber scene precluded
a more full-blooded Bridal
Chorus. In the lovely Prelude
to the opera and in the famous
Wedding March the orchestra—
forged by the skill of the in-
defatigable Mr. Post from an
ensemble of bits-and-pieces into
quite a respectably-balanced
unit —responded eagerly to the
conductor’s persuasive baton.
The casting was a triumph of
commonsense. As Elsa Betty
Fretwell’s combination of warm,
rich tone and demure beauty
was instantly appealing, and she
moved with a serenity which was
almost sufficient answer in itself
to the charge of fratricide
against her. And if it were
scarcely logical to determine her
guilt or innocence only by the
facility with which her knightly
defender used his superior weight
and a hefty shield to spread-
eagle her accuser, it at least
gave Ronald Dowd —a logical
choice in the title role, with his
big improved tenor and a fine
presence marred only by in-
different eye make - u p —an
opportunity for some tender
love-making which at times
found too-lukewarm a response.
Alan Eddy, in an aggressive
beaver, was a dominating Henry
the Fowler, adjudicator in the
martial and matrimonial lists;
but his voice, though resonant,
hadn’t the weight to be expected.
Neil Easton raised a powerful
baritone in making his false
accusations, in which he was
assisted by the Ortrud of Justice
Rettick, darkly sinister and sing-
ing with spirit. Alan Light’s
heraldic utterances reverberated
around the gods and got lost
somewhere up Pitt-street.
The decor by Desmond
Downing was as good as any-
thing put on in Sydney by an
operatic company in two
decades, and the costumes were
entirely convincing. Altogether,
this successful venture into
Wagner confirms the claim of
National Opera that the time is
overdue for opera on a
permanent basis.
Canberra Rep.
Thwarted from the produc-
tion originally planned for this
month by the withdrawal of
amateur rights, the Canberra
Repertory Society turned on
Andre Obey’s “Noah” at four
weeks’ notice.
“Noah” is not a satisfactory
play because Obey starts a hare
on the Ark which he has no
intention of pursuing. His
particular embellishment on the
story is a Noah-Ham conflict,
and the play suffers from the
fact that this conflict is never
fully worked out, not even
clearly stated. Ian Pratt as Ham
did his very good best with an
incompletely developed
character playing an incom-
pletely developed part in the
drama.
Daphne Curtis, as Mrs. Noah,
handled the subtler implications
of her part well, but there were
two occasions when Tom Lowe
as Noah did not quite rise to the
rather erratic demands of the
play. One was at the beginning
of the rain, when he might have
put on with more assurance the
character of the justified prophet
of the Lord ; the other was at
the weak end of the play. But
elsewhere he was excellent. If
he did not quite manage the
dignity of the role, its humor
and pathos were well within his
scope. The warmth of his inter-
pretation pervaded the play and
helped to redeem it.
More redemption was
achieved by the producer Alan
Burke. It was the gusto of the
production which kept it going
and which made good entertain-
ment of a weak play. The pro-
ducer’s handling of the difficult
groupings in the crowded Ark
scenes was ingenious, and the
schooling of the chorus ex-
changes and the mass move-
ments was completely successful.
Vic Forstmann’s sets were
imaginative, strikingly simple
and satisfying, and the support-
ing players, George Ogilvie,
Ronald Penny, Ian Stewart,
Pixie Prince, Judy Ralston,
Barbara Bather and the well-
dressed animals, all sustained
the producer’s verve.
F. M. T.
Hobart Royal.
Settings and costumes and
delightful cameos by Brian Me-
Callum as Thyreus and Robert
Geappen as Menas were the
highlights of Hal Porter’s excel-
lent production of Shakspeare’s
“Antony and Cleopatra” at the
Theatre Royal—the first major
production in the theatre since
its reopening under the aegis of
the National Theatre and Fine
Arts Council of Tasmania.
Valda Dixon’s Cleopatra was
rather disappointing. Miss Dixon
is a fine actress, and on past per-
formances one would have taken
her as a natural for the wilful,
fascinating Cleo ; but her inter-
pretation lacked imagination, and
it was difficult to see how she
managed to capture the passion-
ate, robust Antony, played with
obvious relish by Roger Franco.
By far the best performance
was that of Roger Jennings. His
cold, dispassionate Octavius
Caesar was excellent, and the
clarity of his speech could well
have been used as a model by
the other players—at times it was
difficult to follow the proceed-
ings because of the blurred and
indistinct speech of some of the
players.
Actors must begin somewheie,
but it seems a pity that there
was such a preponderance of
apparent beginners among the
lesser players. It is to be hoped
that, in future productions, they
can be restricted to a reasonable
minimum and cast in parts which
they can adequately handle.
M. L.
John Mound.
John Maund’s show of 36
watercolors, at the Grosvenor
Galleries, Sydney, represents
chiefly his more recent work in
which he goes after his scenes
with something of the quick and
apparently careless dexterity
with which, one imagines, a
collector might whisk his net
after butterflies; in his case
the net is a light but consistent
watercolor technique and his
prey those slight elusive
moments of beauty or drama
which are both the delight and
despair of those who try to
capture them in any medium.
Sometimes the moment eludes
him completely—in fact, one
wonders if it were even there—
and there remain only the duti-
ful washes of color, these in turn
being occasionally clarified to
the point of sterility; but there
are sufficient successful
occasions to justify both the
technique and its object:
“Approaching Southerly,” with
its great cloud looming over
dark hills and a green headland
and the last gleam of light on
water, catches the mood of the
scene very effectively; and
“Spencer,” with its soft light,
clear sky and clouds like flying-
fish, is another suspended
second of nature.
In “Wiseman’s Ferry” the
color is laid on with a firmer
hand and the result is corres-
pondingly richer ; in “Tizzani”
a lighter, defter application of
greens and browns catches a
soft and tranquil pattern of
trees ; and an even lighter touch
makes a slight, pleasing record
in “French’s Forest.” Pink
morning light is pleasantly cap-
tured, along with water, rocks
and trees, in “Dawn”; while
“Near Stan well Park” catches a
road leaping around a cliff under
a stormy sky, looming over
water which seems to be turning
impossible handsprings.
Some of the artist’s broader,
fuller washes from an earlier
period, like the Jamberoo land-
scapes he has shown in the
annual Watercolor Institute ex-
hibitions or his “She-oaks” in
the N. S. Wales National Gal-
lery, would have strengthened
the total effect.
Showing at Tye’s Gallery,
Melbourne, is a collection of
Melbourne street scenes by Leon
Hanson, a young Sydney artist
now living in Melbourne. The
exhibition was originally
planned as a Royal Visit gesture,
and, as such, would have
eminently suited the occasion.
Mr. Hanson’s pictures might be
described as current gossip. They
are picturesque and pleasant and
tell the man in the street what
he would like to know about his
city, and they are selling like
hot cakes. They don’t go far
below the surface, but the sur-
face is quite nice. If anything,
they recall the work of the late
Dora Wilson, who painted Mel-
bourne streets assiduously during
a long lifetime, but never went
deeper.
John Allcot’s “Late After-
noon”—which accords to Sydney
Harbor something of the soft-
ness, warmth and affection with
which Percy Lindsay sees it, but
not the calm serenity of Lind-
say’s vision—is the most pleas-
ing item in the North Shore Art
Society’s exhibition at the
Mosman Town Hall. Two fairly
crisp watercolors by Jean Derrin,
a prosaic landscape by H. A.
Hanke, and a G. K. Townshend
watercolor well below his normal
level stand out a little from
the 63 rather conventional oils
and watercolors which make up
the exhibition.

Large and cumbrous oils by
Margaret Cilento at Sydney
Macquarie Galleries, showing
various influences from Picasso
to Orban, look like a student’s
work, not yet of a standard to
come before the public. In some
small engravings, deriving from
Paul Klee, ambition hasn’t out-
run ability, and there is a
delicate flicker of promise.
Monstrous.
There are dumb monsters up
at the Melbourne Exhibition.
A yellow dinosaurus which
raises its enormous bulk right at
the entrance and was still being
painted when present com-
mentator saw it calls itself a
Mack dumper for off-main-road
use. It has a capacity of a
million shovels at one dump and
would be a nasty thing to meet
rooting and dumping around in
the bush on a dark night.
There are giant sloths, sabre-
toothed tigers and ichthyosauri
in a long avenue adjacent, and
other monsters of all shapes and
sizes with their tamers standing
beside them.
There is one example which
looks as if it had evolved from
the brontosaurus, and which has
a photo on it showing Mr. J.
Allison’s Foden 8-wheeler, with
Gardner Diesel 150-h.p. engine,
and two trailers, whose habitat
is back west of the Darling
River. It transports 500 sheep in
nine hours a distance which
would have taken the old-time
drover four weeks, during which
52 sheep would have been lost
while the others would have lost
an average of 6ilb. on the
journey.
Things are equally monstrous
inside the building, but in an-
other way. There is a Rolls-
Royce chariot with everything in
it that opens and shuts and
which is priced at upwards of
£7OOO, and there is another only
slightly less luxurious which the
salesman said had risen over the
weekend by £lOO. There are an
astonishing lot of Australian
Holdens and brand-new gadgets
by the thousand. But with all
this display of skill, ingenuity,
inventiveness and organisation,
there was no way in which the
official microphone could be got
to work, and Lud Mayor Nilsen
had to shout bis opening address
without its assistance.
The organisation, as usual,
was due to H. W. Harrison, who
has secretaried Melbourne’s
Motor Show for longer than he
can remember and who knows
as much about the evolution of
the petrol-vehicle as anyone—he
drove one of the three tin-lizzies
which inaugurated the motor
age in Australia and used to beat
the cable-trams into the city. His
latest show is the largest yet, and
the most monstrous in the
Southern Hemisphere.

The latest result —it is the best since the
early 1920’5, when both coal and ship-
ping were vastly more profitable than
they are today—helped to brighten the
anaemic sharemarket, which lengthened its
bid for the co.’s £1 ords. from 265. 6d.
at the end of March (they stood at 355. 6d.
a year ago) to 295. 3d. following publica-
tion of the accounts. The return at 295.
3d. is 4.1 p.c. on a 6 p.c. div. basis, with
prospects. The 6 p.c. prefs.—£2so,ooo in
a paid capital of £2,250,000 —at 28s. yield
4.3 p.c. Net tangible cover (book-value)
is £l7 Is. lOd. prefs. and 40s. 2d. ords.
It was better returns from coal and
shipping that put the spring of £57,384 in
last term’s combined net earnings of parent
and subsidiaries. The £257,473 of profit
was written after allowing for deprecia-
tion (£187,965, up £53,453) and taxation
(£251,613, up £202,204). It was enough
to pay the pref. div. (£15,000) and show
12.1 p.c. on ord. capital as against 9.2,
5.5, 7.6, 7.6 and 7.6 p.c. back to 1946.
The cautious board thought hard about
lifting the div.—not an easy question to
determine these days—and decided, owing
to the very uncertain outlook, to strengthen
reserves further and husband the co.’s
cash resources, a policy with which dis-
cerning shareholders will not quarrel. So
the div. was kept at 6 p.c. and £122,473
(47.5 p.c.) of the year’s profit was used to
increase the amount of working capital
available to the parent and its sub-
sidiaries. And the said reserves and cash
resources were further strengthened by
£128,659 net, mainly from sale of the co.’s
rights to B.H.P.’s one-for-three new share-
issue in Jan., 1951, which H.S. did not
take up.
H.S.’s own earnings are derived mainly
from its merchandising and other activi-
ties as tug-owners, stevedores, etc. The
major portion of group profits come from
a widely-spread portfolio in which the
principal holdings are as follows:

First four on the list are subsidiaries —
their figures are incorporated in the con-
solidated accounts summarised in the
introductory table —over whose accounts,
excepting the Caledonian co., the curtain
is kept drawn. Caledonian, which lifted
its output by about 12i p.c., netted
£94,069 (up £65,960) for 1951, of which
£46,428 (double the 1950 figure) was
handed to the prefs. Their divs. are still
£301,792 in arrears, which leaves the
outlook for the ords. bleak for the
present. Invincible Collieries, which has
repaired the flood damage of 1949, is
now operating “successfully” under
mechanisation —it paid its last div. (2£
p.c. in 1947. Divs. paid by B.H.P. (8|
p.c.), Southern Portland (8 p.c.) and A.
Goninan (15 p.c.) were same as for the
previous year.
Recent import restrictions will not
directly affect the co.’s major interests,
which are centred mainly in those essen-
tial industries whose products and ser-
vices seem likely to continue in strong
demand. Also the comfortable financial
position and strong cash-holding of the
group should ensure that its expansion,
development and profit-earning oppor-
tunities are not hamstrung by credit
restrictions and capital-issues control.
Here is the position as consolidated
balance-sheet figures show it;

The 56-year-old Metropolitan, which
writes ordinary, industrial and general
business in the three eastern States and
South Australia, continues to make steady
progress along sound lines, paying regular
bonuses to policyholders and dividends
to shareholders.
A pleasing feature of the development
is the growth in amount of ordinary busi-
ness now being written. Policyholders
get more benefit from ordinary than in-
dustrial contracts. In the O.D. the co. has
to earn £9 or more for policyholders be-
fore shareholders become entitled to £l.
Also, liabilities under O.D. contracts are
valued on a stringent 2} p.c. basis for
with-profit endowment assurances, 2\ p.c.
on other participating contracts and
2\ p.c. on non-participating policies. This
means strong actuarial reserves ; and these
reserves are represented by sound revenue-
producing assets, thus ensuring adequate
protection for policyholders.
In common with other life offices, the
co. has shortened sail in the industrial
field, where collection of premiums is a
weekly door-to-door affair which has be-
come increasingly expensive with the
successive and sharp rises in wage rates
over the last few years. In the I.D. the
co. values its policy liabilities on a 2\ p.c.
Last term £1,483,386 (up £218,314) of
new business was put on the books, of
which ordinary contracts accounted for
£1,023,200 (up £355,988) or 69 p.c. as
against 52.7 p.c, in 1950 and only 34.1 p.c.
in 1939. The other £460,186 (down
£137,674) was long-term industrial busi-
ness.
In the two life departments combined
the year’s income was £751,748 (up
£49,635), of which £607,325 (up £36,827)
was premiums and £144,423 (up £12,808)
interest, rents, etc. After paying all
legitimate claims and exes., a surplus of
£279,486 remained, of which £268,126
was transferred to the statutory life and
other funds, which now total £4,307,500.
The other £11,360 was appropriated for
various purposes, including dividends for
shareholders (£5461).
Claims were well within expectation,
but the exes, continued to climb, as they
inevitably must where they consist mainly
of salaries. In the 0.D., where exes, were
also bumped up by the big increase in
new business, they took 21.6 p.c. (up
2.8 p.c.) of the year’s net premiums, and
in the I.D. 34,2 p.c. (up 1 p.c.). After
deducting taxes, the net rate of interest
earned on mean funds, plus share capital
(£100,000), was £3 13s. Bd. p.c. (up
3s. 2d. p.c.). The margin between this
actual return and the rates assumed in
the valuation are wide enough to ensure
maintenance of existing bonus rates.
In the general or shareholders’ section,
which is also developing nicely, the surplus
was £17,776 (up £4161), of which £15,616
was added to various reserves, lifting them
to £140,857, which is £40,857 in excess of
paid capital. The div. was maintained
at 12+ p.c.
Public securities (up £204,476) account
for approximately two-thirds of total
assets and shares, etc. (up £99,885), for
20.4 p.c.:

After “protracted.” negotiations the co.
has obtained the consent of Capital Issues
Control to double ord. capital by a one-
for-one bonus-share issue (£285,620), and
at the same time to put out for cash
142,810 new £1 ords., one-for-two, at par,
on a date yet to be announced. The gift is
to be made from a reserve created by
revaluation of assets. The market, which
had dropped to 745. 9d. (1425. was paid
in 1951), rose to 84s. following the
announcement. After exercising the
rights, and allowing for brokerage, the
net cost at 84s, is 375. lOd.
The question arises as to what rate of
dividend is likely to be paid in future.
The two issues—first of their kind for
over 20 years —will lift paid capital to
£885,950 in 150,000 A 9 p.c. and 21,900
B 10 p.c. cum. prefs and 714,050 ords.
On that lot the pref. divs. and 15 p.c. to
the ords. would call for £122,797, or
£36,081 more profit than was claimed last
term, whereas the pref. requirements and
10 p.c. to the ords. would exceed last
term’s profit by only £379.
Certainly profits are believed to
be conservatively stated, and there
will be £142,810 of fresh capital
at work, but the immediate out-
look is uncertain, costs are still buoyant,
credit tight, and the co. has a cautious
management. Appearances are, there-
fore, that the div. is more likely to be
10 p.c. than a higher rate. When ord.
capital was doubled by the issue of
£126,000 of bonus-scrip in 1926, the div.
was lowered from 20 p.c. to 15 p.c., and,
except for the five difficult years to 1935,
when distributions averaged 6.7 p.c., has
remained steady since. At 375. lOd.
the return would be 5.3 p.c. on a 10 p.c.
div. basis, which is a very satisfactory
return on a sound industrial equity. And
to shareholders who exercise their rights
10 p.c. would be worth 16.6 p.c. on ord.
capital less the bonus-issue in question.
Ever since it took over the old-
established business of the same name
some 30 years ago the co. has been a
very satisfactory profit-earner and
dividend-payer, and there are good rea-
sons to believe that it will continue so in
the future. The growth of the undertaking
over the period referred to was financed
largely out of surplus earnings and allow-
ances, etc. Activities spread throughout
the Commonwealth and New Zealand,
and include manufacture and/or importa-
tion of yeast, vinegar, bottle seals and
supplies and equipment for cordial manu-
facturers, brewers, bottlers, bakers, con-
fectioners and restaurant- and hotel-
keepers. The earnings of very healthy
subsidiaries are taken credit for only to
the extent of dividends received, and it
is reasonable to suppose that these off-
shoots, whose activities have expanded
rapidly since the war, have followed the
same conservative financial policy as the
parent.
Whether the new cash capital is required
to finance expansion of the parent’s own
business or that of the subsidiaries is
not stated, but the co. has always traded
comfortably within its own resources, as
the following comparison of balance-
sheet figures shows:

To meet last term’s net additions of
£130,790 to book-debts and £27,907 to
stocks only £52,712 was added to the
amount coming to outside creditors, etc.
Excluding shareholdings, the more-or-less
liquid surplus was £265,364 (up £34,254)
when the books last closed.

the undertaking by pricing the f.-p. ss.

shares at 14s. 9d. (21s. 6d. a
year ago) to yield 3.4 p.c. on a
10 p.c. div. basis, which was
nearly 1 p.c. less than the yield
to be had from long-dated Gov-
ernment securities last week.
Visibly net tangible cover is
Bs. 2d. a share.
Except for the seven slump
years to 1937, when distributions
averaged 7 p.c. (lowest 6 p.c.),
the 10 p.c. div. has been an
annual event since 1919. Over
the same period no less than
£548,814 of inner reserves were
disclosed, £250,000 of reserves
were capitalised (in 1924 and
1928) and the Walkerville Co-op.
Brewery, the co.’s biggest com-
petitor, was absorbed (in 1938)
at a cost of £122,189 (in scrip),
which was £149,691 less than the
net tangible book-value of assets
acquired.
Features of the latest accounts
are further expansion of opera-
tions and heavy expenditure on
freeholds (breweries and hotels)
and plant. Turnover (amount
not disclosed) continued to
advance, and has done so for
over a decade. Australian out-
put of beer for the year to June
30 last increased by 10.9 p.c.
(17 million gallons), reaching a
record 173 million gallons, or
more than 20 gallons per head
of population.
After making “adequate”
provision for depreciation of
fixed assets, the spring in the
co.’s gross earnings (£548,243)
was £32,951. Including pro-
vision for taxation and other
contingencies—the providing is
not likely to have been skimped
—exes. (£420,299) gobbled all
the gain and £5443 besides. The
£127,944 of profit claimed was
11.8 p.c. on capital as against
12.3, 12.8, 12.7, 12.6 and 13 p.c.
back to 1947. It was an en-
couraging performance consider-
ing the steep rise in wages, price
of raw materials and all other
operating costs, and the fact that
there was more capital to feed
—£361,040 was gathered at par
in June, 1950.
To meet net additions to free-
holds (up £204,916), plant (up
£256,871) and stocks (pp
£119,674) totalling £581,461,
only £159,024 was added to the
creditors item, which includes
an unspecified provision for
taxation. The expenditure on
plant was mainly connected with
the Southwark brewery, to
which further extensions are to
be made, and the Kent Town
malt-house, completion of which
has safeguarded the co.’s malt
requirements:

The cash holding was drawn
upon for £120,640 and advances
were reduced by £277,293, which
suggests that the bulk of them
had not been tied up in the
trade. The outlay on fixed assets
should improve technical effici-
ency as well as output.
Recent and prospective
growth of population and in-
dustrial expansion in South Aus-
tralia, and the co.’s Broken Hill
connections, are bright spots in
the outlook. But appearances
are that, before long, the public
will have less loose cash in its
pockets, and the recent lift in
the basic wage is likely to be
felt more in costs than in spend-
ing-power. Still, no reduction
in the co.’s dividend rate is
anticipated. What the market
hopes for is another new share-
issue at par. The board gives
no hint that shareholders might
be asked for more at an early
date.
Broken Hill South, one of the
big silver-lead-zinc producers at
the Barrier (N.S.W.), will pay an
interim 4s. (80 p.c.) per ss.
share on June 15. For the year
■to June 30, 1951, the co.
claimed a profit of £1,757,925
(up £616,210), equal to 219 p.c.
on capital, and paid an interim
3s. and final 55,, a total of Bs.
per share, or 160 p.c. It was
the rise in the price of lead and
zinc that bumped up both earn-
ings and divs. Here are average
London (stg.) prices for the two
metals:
Lead. Zinc.

The market for the scrip mainly
follows the market for the
metals. So, despite bigger mine
production and a higher interim
div. for the current term, the
price of the co.’s shares fell
from 755, at March 31 to 60s.
last week. On present indication
the life of the co.’s mine at the
Barrier is considered to be about
15 years. The hunt for new
deposits continues. Most
promising of these is the
Oceana mine at Zeehan (Tas.),
which is being developed jointly
with North Broken Hill. After
spending over £35,000 on in-
vestigation the co. has aban-
doned the search for worth-while
lead-zinc and copper deposits in
the Chillagoe district (N.Q.). The
main factor now influencing
metal prices is not so much
stockpiling as the general level
of business activity and rearma-
ment in the U.S. and elsewhere.
London metal market keeps in
step with New York.


Women’s Letters
From Melbourne
Having seen Albury in its happiest
mood for the Gold Cup Meeting, this
Letter moved on to Canberra, where the
berry-trees are now at their loveliest. A
sample here of the celebrated hospitality
of China’s Minister-Plenipotentiary, his
Excellency Dr. Chen Tai-chu, and his
charming wife. Next at the American
Embassy, which pervades warm friendli-
ness, and thence to the delightful home
on Mugga Way of the High Commis-
sioner for Canada, Mr. T. Fraser Elliott,
and Mrs. Elliott, who dispensed delightful
cookies and coffee. On these three occa-
sions Mrs. Constance Day, her schoolgirl
daughter Deanna and Mrs. Con Curtain
were fellow-guests. Then over the
mountains to Batlow, of apple fame, on
to Tumbarumba, where the hostelry
provided comforts which more than
favorably compared with a large city
hotel; thence to Khankoban, the magni-
ficent station property of Colonel Colin
Chisholm and Mrs. Colin Chisholm, who
is a well-known visitor in Melbourne.
Then out of the warm sunshine to the
cold winter blasts and rain of this city.
Wearing her beautiful 150-year-old lace
christening-robe, which had been worn
by her grandmother and -father at their
baptisms, Edwina Jane Maitland, first-
born of the Hon. Simon Warrender and
Mrs. Warrender, gurgled happily as she
was toasted at a party held at her parents’
Toorak home after the ceremony per-
formed by the Dean of Melbourne, the
Very Rev. Roscoe Wilson, in St. Paul’s
Cathedral. Several relatives and friends
of Simon and Pamela Warrender stood
proxy for godparents who live in Eng-
land. Baby was named for the Countess
of Mountbatten, who is a second cousin
of the baby’s grandfather, Lord Bruntis-
field. Godfathers were the Earl of Dal-
keith, who is her father’s cousin ; her
uncle, the Hon. John Warrender; and
another uncle, her mother’s brother
Rodney Myer. Godmothers were the
Marchioness of Linlithgow, a cousin of
the baby’s father, Mrs. Kenneth Myer
and Edwina Hordern. Present at the party
were the baby’s two grandmothers,
Dorothy Lady Bruntisfield and Mrs.
Gladys Myer. The toast to the baby and
her parents was proposed by Fred E. Lee.
At the party were the Norman Shepherds,
Dr. and Mrs. Cyril Tonkin, Sir Rupert
Clarke, Bt., and his half-sister Lady Olivia
Taylour, who leaves for her home in Eng-
land shortly.
Miranda Casey, who has been in Eng-
land for almost two years and who has
shared with Virginia Davenport a flat in
Chelsea, has just announced her engage-
ment. Miranda is the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Dermot Casey, of Murraba,
Coldstream; her fiance is Maxwell
Brandon, son of Mr. and Mrs. G. H.
Selous, of Bloney, Switzerland. Mrs.
Casey has flown to England to join her
daughter and meet her future son-in-law.
Past and present trainees of the Alfred
Hospital had a night out when a ball was
held in St. Kilda Town Hall to raise
funds for the hospital’s Food for Britain
Appeal and for the Post-Graduate Nurs-
ing Educational Fund. The ballroom
was gay with bowls of autumn flowers,
and in the foyer pretty uniformed nurses
sold leis made by patients in the Alfred.
President of the ball committee, Mrs.
Peter Marshall, received the official
guests, among whom was the - president
of the hospital’s board of management,
W. S. Philip, who was accompanied by
his wife in a lovely gown of silver-grey
slipper satin. Sir Archie Michaelis was
with Lady Michaelis, who wore hyacinth-
blue crepe. Mrs. Ewen Downie, whose
husband, Dr. Downie, is dean of the
Clinical School, added to her turquoise-
blue crepes a matching lace bolero. The
lady superintendent, Miss Lydia Shaw,
teamed a graceful black chiffon skirt and a
strapless pink lace top over which black
sequins were scattered. The matron, Miss
Jean Hanna, wore midnight-blue crepes,
and the deputy-matron, Miss E. Camp-
bell, a beaded black gown.
Among the dancers were Matron
Adcock, of the Margaret Coles Maternity
Hospital, in gold-embroidered black
slipper-satin frock ; Mrs. W. S. Scrivenor,
her choice dove-grey moire taffeta ; her
niece, Kerry Scrivenor, whose pastel-blue
tulle frock was embroidered and finished
with a pink velvet sash; Mrs. Jack Kerr,
who allied a black skirt with a white
guipure-lace top; Mrs. W. McDermott,
who wore a black tulle skirt mounted on
pink tulle and a strapless top of beaded
black velvet; Mrs. H. J. Johnston, in
black tulle over white net; Mrs. Don
Urquhart, whose turquoise-blue faille
gown had a huge bow of burgundy velvet
on one shoulder ; and Mrs. E. Brown, her
deep royal-blue Chinese brocade gown
strapless.
Accustomed to a gay setting for the
first act of “Giselle,” with principals and
corps de ballet wearing colorful and pretty
peasant costumes, it was surprising to
find this ballet set in dull autumn sur-
roundings and the dancers wearing garish
orange and dull-brown. But the dancing
of English Paula Hinton and Walter Gore
lifted the dullness and greatly pleased the
audience which filled the Princess on the
first night. In the party of the president
of the National Theatre Movement, Sir
Robert Knox, were Mrs. G. I. Stevenson,
who covered her black gown with a hip-
length white ermine jacket; Mrs. A. T.
Smithers, whose choice was silver-grey
brocade ; and Mrs. Cyril Tonkin, in black
crepe. Mrs. Garnet Carroll covered her
black velvet dinner-gown with a white
Arctic-fox cape stole. Mrs. Massey
Burnside wore a short full jacket over
black that was embroidered and treated
with multicolored rhinestones. Mrs. E.
Cornfoot’s ensemble was black and while.
Mrs. John Bray wore black-and-gold-
striped taffeta. Mrs. Frederick Ebbels
chose a short black-and-gold-patterned
brocade frock, Mrs. Aubrey Gibson’s
currant-red crepe gown was worn under
a dyed ermine coat. Mrs. Fred Dennett’s
black gown was worn with a silver mink
stole.
The weather was very unkind to
Beverley, eldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Charles Bourchier, of Glen Iris, for she
arrived at Melbourne Grammar Chapel
in cold sleety rain to be married to
Robert lan, only son of Mr. and Mrs.
Archie Munro, of Toorak. Beverley’s
lovely gown of white French organza had
the bouffant skirt and long-sleeved bodice
appliqued with lace motifs. From a
Juliet cap of white guipure lace, edged
with orange-blossom, fell the full-length
tulle veil. Her bouquet was of gardenias,
stephanotis and tuberoses, Mrs. Richard
Timson was matron-of-honor; Shierley
Bourchier, sister of the bride, and the
’groom’s sister Joan were bridesmaids;
and Joy Bourchier, the bride’s younger
sister, was flower-girl. They were frocked
alike in orchid-pink organdie with white
flower embroidery edging the deep frills
on the bodice, which fell across the
shoulders to form sleeves and which
matched the diagonal frills on the skirt.
They carried pink Ophelia rosebuds, and
their tiny orchid-pink toques were circled
with feathers. Noel Dann was best man
and John Abbs and Bill Williams grooms-
men.
In receiving, with her husband, over 200
guests at the buffet-dinner which followed
at the New Alexandra, Mrs. Bourchier
wore a full skirt of royal-blue faille and
a bodice of white guipure lace. Her
small royal-blue faille hat was trimmed
with opalescent pearls and sequins. Mrs.
Archie Munro wore dove-grey nylon with
the bodice heavily beaded; her hat was
of grey panne velvet edged with diamente.
Among the guests were Mrs. Royden
Honeyman, whose lovely white faille
gown had the bodice beaded with pearls
and silver sequins ; Mrs. Gwen Davidson,
in grey chiffon ; Ray Thomas, her satins
emerald-green; Betty Marriott, whose
pale lilac satin frock was matched by
her tiny cap; Diana Salfinger, who had
an emerald-green taffeta coat over her
white crepe ballerina frock; Doreen
Boberski, whose grey chiffon gown was
mounted on lavender satin; Mrs. John
Mee, her gold faille spotted in emerald-
green ; Wendy Schofield, who added a
little cap to her self-patterned white
organza; and Joan Saunders, in frock
and tiny bolero of blue-and-silver lame.
From Sydney
The opera season opened with a literal
flourish of trumpets when heralds from
the cast of “Lohengrin” summoned the
loiterers into the Tivoli on the opening
night. The dressing wasn’t quite so
brilliant as last year’s, perhaps because it
was such a cold night and people gave
the impression of huddling into furs
rather than dripping with them. At the
party in the foyer after the show, how-
ever, there was more opportunity to see
the dresses and the sparkles. Mrs. C. T.
Lorenz’s dress was apple-green, and by
skilful draping and festooning it success-
fully disposed of 40yds. of ninon and
25 of taffeta. The Lady Mayoress’s pink
nylon looked festive. (She and all the
other ladies in the official party carried
Victorian posies). Mrs. Erik Langker’s
dress was of soft green, pleated
diagonally on the bodice. The black
dress of the Countess Pietrasanta
Sauveigne was covered with a full-length
cape of fox. Mrs. W. Simpson and Mrs.
Keith Morris also looked elegant in black.
Among the first-nighters sighted in the
throng were Margaret Salenger and her
fiance, Dr. Robert Gill, Dr. and Mrs.
Tom Bateman, Mrs. Florence Taylor,
Miss Margaret Gillespie, Madame Mathy,
Madame Murotta, Miss Gladys Hart,
Mrs. Hope Gibson and Mrs. Rose Taplin.
This is Prudence McCauley, younger
daughter of Air-Vice-Marshal J. P. J.
McCauley and Mrs. McCauley, of Manar,
Macleay-street, whose marriage to
Mr. D. Stewart, of Roseville, will take
place at St. Canice’s on the 24th of this
month. Photo by Hugh Spencer.
One of the most striking garments to
be seen at the Opera was the cream silk
brocade cloak worn by Mrs. Bruce Mac-
farlan. Banded in brown fur at the
top, it leaves the neck and shoulders bare
and then descends, unimpeded by belt or
dart, in a pyramid line to the ground. It’s
very like Balenciaga and a little hard to
wear, but Mrs. Macfarlan looks dramatic
and angelic in it. Another notable
evening outfit is Mrs. Roberto Regala’s
black dress with the stiffened net sleeves
sparkling with silver to match the deep
triangular collar also glittering with silver
sequins.
It’s delightful to see prima donnas who
can sing so well and look so beautiful as
Betty Fretwell and Barbara Wilson. As
ardent firstnighter Mrs. Florence Taylor
said after hearing them: “If this goes on
they’ll be coming to us for our singers
as they do for our jockeys.”
If there seems to be a decided increase
in the number of intelligent-looking
people round town this week it is prob-
ably because the Institution of Engineers
is holding its first conference here' since
1939. Visitors include Dr. and Mrs. L.
Loder, and Dr. and Mrs. Wilfred Chap-
man from Melbourne, Professor Alan
Burn from Hobart, Professor and Mrs.
Moorhouse (also from Melbourne), Mr.
and Mrs, David Garland (Brisbane) and
the Rex Parsons and H. J. Hodgsons from
Adelaide. The councillors and officials
of the Institution were entertained with
their wives at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
Vivian Brain, of Killara, on Sunday after-
noon, and Sydney put on some of its
sweetest May weather for the occasion.
Schoolgirl daughter of the house Cornelia
helped her mother to entertain and young
son Stephen did a very neat job of hand-
ing-round savories. Among those present
were Professor David Myers and Mrs.
Myers, Mr. and Mrs. W. Gibbs, the
W. E. Bassetts from Melbourne and Miss
Winefred Ball, who has been secretary of
the Melbourne division for 25 years and
is closely associated with the work of the
Institution.
Later in the evening informal parties
were held by members of the committee,
who included Captain and Mrs. G. I. D.
Hutcheson, the Edwin Crawfords, Rod
Campbells, C. H. D. Harpers, C. G.
Caimans, Cyril Goodmans and Noel
Pantons. It is expected that the confer-
ence will have a somewhat nautical bias
with marine engineering the vital topic.
Is it because of this (it is asked innocently)
that the Show Boat was chosen for the
conference dance?
One of the oddest exhibitions of show-
manship seen for some time was put on
by Mischa Auer and Cliff Edwards at a
recent function held for charity. Having
arrived late, they bowed, looked round,
and Mischa said “This looks like a dog-
show.” (Cliff barked.) Then Mischa said
“It’s nice to see you all, but as there’s
no amplifying system here there’s no
point in giving a performance.” As they
walked out in the amazed silence of the
crowd Mischa said “That’s what you call
deafening applause.” Only redeeming
feature was that Cliff did make some
effort —at least he barked!
We see the members of St. John Ambu-
lance at all public functions, and we
have seen them since childhood. We
take them for granted, and in a vague
way imagine that they are part of some
Government service. But this isn’t so,
for the wonderful thing is that all this
first-aid work is given and done without
any payment. The St. John Ambulance
doesn’t receive much help from social
functions, but naturally it needs money,
so it’s really up to all of us to recognise
the work that is done and to give a help-
ing hand.
Mrs. C. M. Croft lent her waterside
home at Elizabeth Bay for an American-
tea held on Saturday in aid of St. John
Ambulance. A feature of the entertain-
ment were national dances by Mr. and
Mrs. Nils Hallenborg (Sweden) and young
Amefil and Aleli Agbayani (Philippines).
Dr. H. Poate, who is a sub-Prior of the
order in Australia, said that St. John
Ambulance is one of the oldest organisa-
tions in the British Empire, being nearly
1000 years old. Her Majesty the Queen
is the Grand Prior and the Governor-
General is Prior. It is, he said, to the
credit of Australia that we have the
greatest number of cadets in the Empire.
When Nancy Walton opened the exhi-
bition of paintings by Molly Johnson at
Turramurra during the week she com-
mented on the courage and energy of the
artist, who could muster up 40 pleasant
paintings for a showing although she has
three children, aged two, four and five, to
care for and is camping in three canvas
cottages and a log-cabin kitchen while
her house is being built. Mrs. Johnson,
who has been studying with artist Hay-
ward Veal, plans to start a school for
artists at Turramurra, as she thinks
that there is quite sufficient interest in
art on the North Shore line to warrant it.
How New Australians get things
mixed! One of them was very dis-
appointed because he couldn’t borrow
money from the Water Board at 4i p.c.
The advertisements said it was a loan, so
naturally he thought they’d lend it to him.
Pianist Badura-Skoda, who will play
three concerti with the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra on May 14, looks very slender
and young to tackle such a task. Actually
he is 26, and has had already some bril-
liant successes in Europe. After his Aus-
tralian tour he goes to America, and
hopes to return to Vienna with a tale of
great triumphs. There is a special reason
for this, as his wife, Eva, to whom he was
married only last September, was unable
to come on these tours with him. Eva
is a musicologist, and will take her
degree as Doctor of Music at the Univer-
sity of Vienna next month. “I won’t be
there for the ceremony,” said the pianist.
“And she won’t be here for my great suc-
cess (as I hope).”
At the reception held for Paul Badura-
Skoda it was interesting to meet members
of the Committee for Youth Concerts,
who are so enthusiastic about their work
that they devote at least three nights a
week to it. Alan Ziegler is president,
Bruce Kay treasurer and Jean Barber
secretary. The committee is recruited
from youth organisations of all denomi-
nations and types, and there are about 16
members. Their work includes bringing
recorded music and arranging concerts
for schools and institutions, where then-
reception, they say, grows steadily
warmer as the appreciation of classical
music increases.
The foyer of the Town Hall is looking
quite glamorous with its parquet floor
shining with polish enough to rival the
chandelier. It reminds one, however, of
the old-fashioned parlor because it
can’t be used much for fear of “messing
it up.” Thus smoking is forbidden for
fear of sparks and ash on the precious
wood. The result is that the audience
congregates in the cold marble corridors
during intervals, which won’t add much
to the joy of living as the westerlies get
more wintry.

PERSONAL ITEMS
A Melbourne “Herald” reporter before
he went abroad and made himself into a
writer of best-sellers, Alan Moorehead
is back in his hometown. War corre-
spondent for the London “Daily Express”
in the newsful 1939-45 years, he after-
wards made his first hit with a biography
of Field-Marshal Montgomery, which has
been described as one of the best bio-
graphies of a living person in the Eng-
lish language. His latest effort, The
Traitors, tells the story of Fuchs, the
physicist who decamped from England
with atom-secrets. It will be read by
several million readers this year, serial-
ised in the “Saturday Evening Post.” An-
other of his books, Rage of the Vulture,
is being filmed by Hollywood. Educated
at Scotch College and the University of
Melbourne. Address: Villa Diana, Fie-
sole, Florence.
Back in 1949 Bulletin story-writer
Tom Hungerford collected second-prize
(no first awarded) in Sydney “Herald’s”
novel-competition, with his first book,
Sowers of the Wind. He gathered the
material for it while on a post-War-II
spell in Japan with the A.I.F. What’s in
SOLDIER-AUTHOR.
his following book, The Ridge and the
River, he garnered during what was far
from a spell, commandoing on Bougain-
ville. The latter book, a highly-competent
record of patrol-work in Nip-held
jungles (Red Paged in this issue), also
won a “Herald” prize in a later com-
petition ; it’s on the bookstalls now. A
journalist on Perth “Daily News” when
the drum sounded, Hungerford joined up
in 1941, and had most of his service in
the Pacific. After the war he helped edit
the Australian War Memorial’s Service
annual, As You Were, and, for a brief
time, was Billy Hughes’s secretary. A
husky six-footer with his commando
training still visible on his frame,
Hungerford is no study author. To get
material for a third book (not yet pub-
lished), he left the War Memorial and
worked for months as a kitchen-hand in
a Canberra migrant-hostel; leaving the
grease and steam of his washing-up tubs
each night for his typewriter in a tiny bed-
room. Before he left the hostel, material
garnered, he had been elevated to
lavatory-cleaner. He’s now with the
Federal Government’s News and
Information Bureau in Canberra. Like-
ness by Heth.
John Eccles has taken one of the two
red balls from his flag—which steps him
up from rear- to vice-admiral. He had
command of the Australian Fleet from
1949 till last October.
Back home in Melbourne, Dr. Rupert
A. Myers, 31-year-old atom-scientist.
Since graduating in physics from Mel-
bourne University, he has been at Har-
well, where British atomic research goes
on under a dense cloud of silence.
Deputy-chief of the metallurgical divi-
sion there, he was the first scientist in the
Commonwealth to produce metallic tan-
talum in the form of power. He’s headed
for the Chair of Metallurgy in the N.S.W.
University of Technology.
John Howlett-Ross, author, elocutionist
—instructor in the spoken word, as he
likes to call himself —and radio-raconteur,
keeps on as full of energy as ever,
though it’s 95 years since Fitzroy, Mel-
bourne, heard his first wail, and he can
remember, as a 15-year-old proof-reader,
conning the MSS. of Marcus Clarke’s
For the Term of His Natural Life before
it went to the printer. A friend of Adam
Lindsay Gordon, Tenniel of “Punch,”
Sarah Bernhardt, Henry Irving and C. J.
Dennis (who gave him permission to
quote from his poems, copyright regard-
less), he is not only an elocutionist, but
a statistician —52 years ago the Royal
Statistical Society made him a Fellow.
He was in on broadcasting at its incep-
tion, and gave some of the first lectures
from 3LO and 3AR when they were pri-
vate shows. Just now he’s engaged on
additions to a new edition of his Study
of the Spoken Word at his home in East
Melbourne.
Heading west on a five-montns’ tour
of British, European and American cities,
Perth’s town clerk, W. A. Mclnnes
Green, will do all the fact-finding he can
about the impact of increasing industrial-
isation on adolescent cities. Perth City
Council’s decision to send Green abroad
was prompted by a desire to see what
effect the coming of the Kwinana refinery
is likely to have on the city, but he will
look into general problems of town-plan-
ning, traffic problems and anything else
which may affect the development of the
Westralian capital. The fact-finder is
eminently fitted for the job ; since he
became town clerk in 1942 he has seen the
emergence of problems whose solution is
daily becoming more urgent. A robust,
pleasant-mannered 56, he is a Digger of
the Kaiser’s war, a shrewd observer, and
Ce owner of a keen analytical mind.
Although it isn’t in his terms of refer-
ence, he will probably make an examina-
tions of some overseas golf-courses, for
purposes of comparison with his own
club at Cottesloe.
One thing missing from this year’s
Anzac Day in Melbourne was the cus-
tomary cable from Field-Marshal Bird-
wood. He died three weeks after the last
march. A fund has been started to erect
a memorial to him in London.
“Cauboy”: When Larry Adler was
playing his mouth-organ at the Tivoli in
Melbourne the number of music-lovers
who varied their habit of listening to
famous virtuosi at the Town Hall to go
and hear this virtuoso of a humble in-
strument could have been counted on the
fingers of one hand. If you had sug-
gested to them that one day Larry would
receive an honor previously confined to
your Menuhins and Giesekings they
would have thought you barmy. All the
same, it has happened. Vaughan Wil-
liams, the doyen of British composers
and possibly the greatest living, heard of
Larry during his tour of England, invited
him to his house and got him to play his
harmonica. Williams was so taken with
it that he wrote a Romance for Har-
monica and Small Orchestra. It will
have its first airing at Liverpool
Stadium in June, and later will be heard
at an Albert Hall promenade concert.
Vaughan Williams is 79, but not as con-
servative as a young Australian conductor
who told me to dissuade a grandson of
mine from taking up the guitar because
no decent music had been written for it.
A man whose first job was toolmaking
at the Lithgow Small Arms factory be-
came Controller-General of Munitions
Supply the other day. Raymond Doyle
has loaded a barrelful of know-how in
between the two jobs. An Old Fortian
apprenticed to Clyde engineering works,
he studied electrical and mechanical
engineering at Sydney Tech,, collected
diplomas in both, and in no time rose
to the assistant-managership at Lithgow
Small Arms. Remaining in the bang-
business, he transferred to Melbourne,
assistant-manager of the ordnance
factory, from there became manager of
the ammunition factory, and in 1939
voyaged to England on special mission.
A few weeks after the hardware began
to descend in Europe, he was recalled to
Australia, to the central administration
of the Munitions Department. Old
Digger, a trap-jawed, earnest 58, he is
recently back from studying the Old
Dart’s latest in the way of dartmaking
(atomage mark), and amuses himself
with tennis when he can find time.
Coming home for good, Harold Wil-
liams, owner of Australia’s sweetest male
voice. Born at Woollahra (N.S.W.), but
brought up in Geelong, Brownlee’s birth-
place, he has done most of his singing
since War I in England and Europe,
except for occasional tours with opera
companies down this way. He will teach,
as well as spray the operatic ether with
his baritone in Australia.
Somebody asked C. W. Joyce, State
secretary of the R.S.L. in Melbourne, how
much the Anzac Day march cost, but Mr.
Joyce wasn’t telling. “We would rather
keep the figure to ourselves. It’s some-
thing we don’t reckon in terms of
money.” A fact not generally known is
that the R.S.L. finds all the cash.
Augeas, whose stables hadn’t been
cleaned for 30 years until Hercules came
along, had nothing on the Victorian
Government, whose mental - hospital
system, from all accounts, is in something
the same condition, classically speaking.
Hercules did his job by turning the
river Alpheus through the Augean stables ;
psychiatrist Dr, Cunningham Dax, here
depicted, has the job of modernising the
out-dated Victorian system—his river is
£6 million, which he has asked the
Government that brought him out to
find over five years. Well on the young
side, Dr. Dax has an international
reputation, and Nithern Hospital, at
Coulsdon (Eng.), which he managed, is
world-famed for demonstrating what can
be done curatively for the mentally
afflicted. He intends first to put the huge
block at Kew in order, then the hospitals
scattered through the country. Astonished
at the amount of voluntary assistance he
has been offered, he proposes establishing
MENTAL-MEDICO.
numerous small clinics where patients,
by early treatment, will be saved from
being swallowed-up in the big hopeless
institutions like Kew. Lodged with his
authority in one of Melbourne’s most
beautiful old buildings in Queen-street,
he already has a fine staff about him.
Easily-accessible, he’s the antithesis of the
traditional civil servant.
In Australia for the annual junket-
ings which celebrate the Coral Sea
battle (which began 10 years ago to-
morrow, at 11.30 of a fine morning just
north of Misima Island), Lt.-General
Robert Eichelberger (K.8.E., in addition
to his seven rows of ribbons), had
a little to do with spring-cleaning in
that area himself. Naming Buna, Sanan-
anda, Hollandia, Biak in his list of New
SOLDIER-GUEST.
Guinea battle-honors, he went on to com-
mand the Eighth Army (known as the
“Amphibious Eighth”), and led it on
some 52 amphibious landings in the
Philippines. Because of the Eighth’s
battle-tried competence, MacArthur
selected it to deliver the main punch in
the invasion of Japan. The Hiroshima
bomb altered those plans, and on August
30, 1945, Eichelberger landed on Atsugi
airfield, to greet, two hours later, Mac-
Arthur on his landing. One-time boss of
West Point, and, earlier, intelligence-
officer in Siberia and Japan, Eichelberger,
with his War II know-how of the occupa-
tion of the latter country, was detailed
after the war to act as consultant to Far
East affairs in Washington. A frosty-
pated, jutting-nosed 66, still lean, he has
“stamped a thousand platforms” in the
U.S. trying to drive home his pet con-
victions —the importance of air-power
and the Pacific in any future scrap. He
ought to know.
A man who knows the district the six
Victorian hikers were lost in as well as
he does his own sitting-room in War-
burton is Jack Lewis, alias the “Bush
Rat,” the Victorian Board of Works chief-
ranger. Owning to a passion for the pre-
servation of the virgin forest, he has
raised over 200 varieties of gumtrees in
his huge, backyard. He prefers a hollow
log to human habitations, and cures his
not-infrequent snakebites by a method of
his own. Melbourne University is in-
debted to him for some rare geological
and other specimens he has collected in
the forest. In his younger days he walked
across Australia.
Into the Silence:
In Wellington (N.Z.), at 71, Adam Hamilton,
a farmer before he took on a 24-year period
in politics. In the depression years Minister
of Labor and Minister of Unemployment
(with little of the one and a surfeit of the
other), he led the National Party in Opposition
from 1936 to the start of War 11. Then he
resigned in favor of present Prime Minister
Holland, though he saw the war out in the
War Cabinet.
In Canberra, at 59, Jean-Marie Gabriel
Padovani, French Ambassador to Australia
since 1949. A Doctor of Laws, with 32 years
in his country’s diplomatic service, he had
fathered it in several European capitals, was a
delegate to the League of Nations disarmament
conference in 1931, and was on the Allied
Control Council in Austria after that country’s
disarming at the end of War 11. He will be
buried in France.
In Perth, at 67, Francis Henry Van Heurck.
Associated for a lifetime with the printing
industry in Westralia, he had been State and
Federal president of the Printers’ and Allied
Trades Employers’ Association.
At 75, in Auckland (N.Z.), George Sutherland,
champion cyclist. In the 90’s, at 18, he won
the half-mile, five-mile and ten-mile events at
Dunedin, all in one afternoon. Later he defeated
the world’s sprint champion when he represented
M.L. at the world’s championship in Paris.
He afterwards went big-game-huming in
Africa.

The Merino Embargo.
“R. Ney”: Once again the
Commonwealth has been invited
to lift the embargo on the export
of stud Merinos—put on way
back in the days of the Sculiin
Government to save what was
then about the only asset Aus-
tralia had, the wool industry, so
that South Africans, Japanese
and others couldn’t start build-
ing up Merino flocks. This time
the sheepbreeders’ deputation,
headed by Mac Falkiner, of
Wanganella, asked Commerce
Minister McEwen to lift it for a
trial period of five years. Mc-
Ewen was noncommittal.
There is so much to be said
for and against the embargo
that debates seldom get any-
where. The anti-embargo men,
however, have two new lines of
argument, and the public is
going to hear about them, for a
publicity campaign is afoot to
“educate politicians and public”
against continuance of the ban.
The most cogent of the two
arguments has American back-
ing. It is, briefly, that the com-
petition of artificial fibres is so
keen and increasing that Aus-
tralia alone cannot hold the
wool fort; it needs the help of
sheep-men elsewhere, and they
can’t do much unless they pro-
duce the wool, which they can’t
produce unless allowed to im-
prove their flocks with good
Merino blood from Australia.
There is a very strong agri-
cultural lobby in Washington
(D.C.), and a good part of its
strength comes from the sheep-
running south-west States of
Texas, Kansas, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, etc. These people have
to convince the American Gov-
ernment of their claim for some
sort of protection for wool
against artificials, but if they
haven’t the wool they haven’t an
argument. Given Australian
stud stock they claim they can
improve and increase the wool,
strengthen their argument, and
create a bigger market for wool,
which would be to Australia’s
benefit.
The other argument is that
numbers of good wool sheep in
Australia are falling; so are the
numbers of breeders. Closer-
settlement is reducing large runs
and a market strictly limited to
Australian buyers is shrinking,
so that breeders of studs are
finding the going a little tough
and some are getting out of
breeding and concentrating on
growing wool. Given an over-
seas outlet for studs, say the
protagonists of this argument,
breeders would respond with
bigger breeding programmes and
the breeding side of the Merino
industry would recover.
There are, of course, argu-
ments for the other side, some of
them pretty solid, and all pretty
well known to wool- a.id sheep-
men. When the publicity
campaign gets going the Aus-
tralian people are likely to learn
a lot more about the industry
on which their national economy
is based.
Using the Head.
“Ngaduri”: Two years ago I
took on managing a small farm
in South Australia. Buying the
equipment needed for working
200 acres of what was intended
to be first-class pasture being
beyond us, we bought a 6ft. set
of tandem disk-harrows for £BB
then got a blacksmith to make a
carriage on pneumatic tyres so
that the harrows could be set at
varying depths or taken right out
of the ground. The carriage
cost £45. A 6ft. seed-box driven
with a chain from one wheel,
with hoses leading into flexible-
steel pipes just inside the last row
of disks, cost an additional £4O.
The machine was hooked on
to a tractor. The extra weight
of carriage and seed-box put her
down to over 4in. in our sandy-
loam flats and to 3in. in the iron-
gravel slopes. For pasture work
this was all we desired. The
land was given three successive
cultivations with the same imple-
ment, plus ordinary spike har-
rows hooked on behind, until we
had a tilth approaching that of
most gardens. In September we
discovered that there had been
no real need to fix the position
of the hoses for seeding. The
disks were not helping while
they were in the ground but
were better taken right out and a
long chain dragged behind to
cover the lucerne- and phalaris-
seed. The resultant pasture was
a complete success. This
tempted us to use the same
implement for sowing the hay-
crop during the next season, and
we got 75cwt. to the acre of
first-class hay.
I don’t suggest this disk imple-
ment does a better job than any
other. I know that, whereas we
had to cultivate three times with
the disk and spike harrow, we
could have done the same job
twice with a spring-tyne culti-
vator or, even, once with a
cultivator, roller and harrows,
I don’t claim that the disk will
do a better job of turning over
the soil in ploughing. In fact,
we were not interested in turn-
ing down the green sod half so
much as in chewing into the soil
to help keep it porous and open
instead of forming an imper-
vious layer a few inches down.
But I do claim that for the
small farmer this implement,
even though it may have to be
used more often to do the same
job, is a good investment, since
it can be made to do all the
jobs of working land, whereas
a cultivator would be kept for
only a few days’ use
every year. Every day an
implement spends in the
shed it represents capital-
investment not earning
money. And the im-
portant thing is that this
implement brings modern
farm-equipment within
the limited means of a
man just starting off,
when with the accepted
types he would not be
able to afford to equip the farm.
For £l5O we had an implement
eminently suitable to our special
circumstances. It was very
small; but then it would never
be used for more than 40
acres of pasture annually, except
when it was also used as a top-
dresser.
Heredity in Beef.
“Frank H.”; Clinton K.
Tomson, the Chicago (U.S.A.)
man who judged the Shorthorns
at Sydney Royal Show, says that
beef-breeders have discovered
that the growth measures in
beef-cattle are more associated
with heredity than are the
measures of quality and con-
formation. This has been proved
in a study of heredity in beef-
cattle at Montana Agricultural
Experiment Station.
It was found that the “herit-
ability” of weight-for-age was
lowest at weaning-time (this was
influenced by variation in milk-
production of mothers). Herit-
ability was greatest for weight-
at-15 months (92 p.c.); rate-of-
gain on feed was inherited to
the extent of 77 p.c.; birth
weight 53 p.c.; and weaning
weight only 28 p.c. Carcass
grades were the least heritable
among conformation measures
—33 p.c.
Tomson said that this means
that the cattle-man seeking bulls
that will merely give superior
type of live or carcass calf-
crops will get very little for his
money. On the other hand, if he
wants faster gains and weight-
for-age in combination with best
market type, he must select bulls
that in their own growth have a
proved performance in these
characteristics.
The idea that bulls will influ-
ence heavier weaning weights in
calves is fallacious. Nor is there
any association between con-
formation points and ability to
gain, disproving a common belief
among cattle-men that faster
gain can be attained by using
conformation characteristics as
the measuring-stick.
Warning to Maizegrowers.
“F. Dent”; According to
L. R. Kavanagh, N.S.W. Agro-
nomist, “Seed saved from com-
mercial hybrid-maize crops is
not really hybrid-maize seed at
all ; it will not produce the high
yields expected of true hybrid-
maize ; any attempt to sell it as
“I'll take 'im for a walk before tea.”
such is misrepresentation—
intentional or otherwise.”
Maizegrowers, says Kava-
nagh, should always insist on
registered (that is, first-genera-
tion) hybrid-maize seed when
buying.
Replicated trials at Hawkes-
bury Agricultural College during
1950-51, conducted to compare
the yield of first-generation seed
with the yield of the pseudo-
hybrid, or second-generation,
maize crops, gave these results;
Standfast hybrid, first-genera-
tion seed, 78 bushels an acre,
second-generation seed, 68
bush.; Ensign h., 86, 66 ; Dawn
h., 58, 40; D. 5.28 h., 58, 45.
The respective percentage falls
in yields from second-generation
seed were 13, 23, 29 and 21 per
cent. Standfast and Ensign
represented the late-maturing
group of hybrids, and Dawn and
D. 5.28 the early-maturing group.
The Field Officer.
“C.S.”: One of the most im-
portant men in rural industry is
the agricultural field-officer,
according to H. J. Geddes,
M.Sc. (Agric.), who is in charge
of the McGarvie Smith Animal
Husbandry Farm near Liverpool
(N.S.W.).
“It is only through the
information-officer that we can
get the desired improvements in
rural output. His efforts should
not be hampered by lack of
facilities or finance. He has a
particular part to play in
pasture-improvement to lift
carrying capacity.
“Pasture-improvement is no
hackneyed catch-cry; it cannot
be repeated too often. Good
pastures provide food at a fifth
of the cost of hand-feeding.
They require no harvesting un-
less saved for hay or silage.
They enable productivity to be
increased without damage to
soil-fertility.”
Bees in Winter.
“Springvale”: Move the
brood combs into the bottom
box and make a compact brood-
nest with pollen and honey-
combs adjacent to the outside
brood combs, and within easy
reach of the cluster.
Be sure that every comb is
loaded with honey; many
appear to be so, but close
inspection reveals excess pollen.
Prolific pollen supplies from
manna-gum and stringybarks in
autumn result in a 50 to 70 per
cent, content in many combs.
A strong colony requires from
401 b. to 601 b. of honey in
southern areas where a winter
flow is not available. Colonies
with insufficient stores for winter
should be given sealed stores
from colonies with a surplus.
Failing this, a supply of sugar-
syrup must be given to carry
them through winter.
Colonies found to be queen-
less should be united with a
normal colony by the newspaper
method. Remove the cover and
place a sheet of newspaper over
the cluster of the normal colony.
Remove the bottom board from
the hive of the queenless
colony, and place this hive with
its cover intact, above the news-
paper over the normal colony
cluster. Both clusters should
unite peacefully after gnawing
away the newspaper, but if
hostilities occur smoke the
treated colonies liberally at
intervals of 10 minutes until the
warfare ceases.
All colonies should have a
good waterproof covering, and
the hive should be tilted slightly
forward to drain water from the
bottom board.
A Tree Campaign.
“Wilga”: If Miss Judith
Cassells and the Forestry
Advisory Council have their
way, rural N.S.W. will soon be
a bower of trees. At the C.W.A.
conference last month delegates
were handed free 4000 packets
of tree- and shrub-seed for
planting wherever they choose.
Mrs. I. B. Wyatt, a vice-
president of the F.A.C., distri-
buted the packets. It was the
THE WEATHER.
By Inigo Jones.
There is now only one northern sunspot visible, and
northern spots usually have very little to do with Australia.
The effects of the late intense groups are still being felt,
but are rapidly dwindling. .
According to both Bruckner cycles the next rain is due
early in May, with a fairly wide distribution. It looks
good for the coast, but lighter inland.
The cold spell seems to determine the position of the
short Bruckner cycle, an important cyclical control. This
cycle had good winter rains over almost all the continent
except north of Capricorn, where falls were rather light
and scattered.

second year in succession of seed-
distribution.
This year’s handout eclipsed
that of 1951 by 1000 packets.
Last year’s total was 45,000
seeds, this year’s soared to
120,000. Much of the seed was
donated by country tree-lovers.
Out of 85 species of trees and
shrubs represented, the gums
were in greatest evidence, and
old-man saltbush was also given
a chance to help reclothe the
land.
Jack Scougall, manager of the
Zinc Corporation’s tree planta-
tions at Broken Hill, made some
cuttings of the drought-resistant
athel-tree available for such
outposts as Tibooburra, Wanaa-
ring and Lightning Ridge. More
seed will be handed out at the
Commerical Apiarists’ Associa-
tion conference in May.
Ducks and Chicks.
“Sarina”: Free range means
quicker development in duck-
lings and chickens. They then
get greenstuff, insects and grit.
Water-tins (placed in the shade)
should be wide and shallow
(chicks may be drowned in deep
tins, and ducklings, by swim-
ming, foul or spill the water).
Chickens will do on two or three
feeds of mash and grain daily,
but ducklings should have a
dish of wheat in their quarters
constantly. When they are fed
on mash there should always be
a water-tin handy.
Chickens and ducklings should
not be run together, nor should
either be run with older stock
of their own kind until they are
well advanced.
Hints for the Farm.
“P. Creek”: Home gardeners
with limited space should con-
centrate on small cabbage
varieties. One of the best is
Sugarloaf, and Jersey Wakefield
and First Early are good. Sow
the seed thinly in a seed-bed of
rather poor soil, and thin-out
the seedlings so as to get sturdy,
straight-stemmed plants for
transplanting. Put the seedlings
12in. apart; in shallow holes if
water will be scarce.
“W. Court”: Cabbages grow
well on old stable- or fowl-
manure ; failing this stir a
handful of blood-and-bone into
each hole before transplanting
the seedlings. A little nitrate of
soda or sulphate of ammonia
dissolved in water will top them
off when they get near hearting.
“Billjim”: Where vege-
table-seed is being saved for
future use see that it is placed
in dry conditions in a cloth con-
tainer, paper-bag or envelope,
then put in a tin against mice
and rats. Cured and stored
carefully most seeds will last for
years,
“Sundowner”: Before winter
sets in build up litter in the
poultry-pens to a depth of 6in.
and don’t change it during
winter. With pullets about to
lay, results will be more satis-
factory if they are fed on a mash
which includes 10 per cent, of
meatmeal and a regular supply
of fish-oil if greenfeed is not
available.
“Koo-wee-rup”: Attend to
rhubarb plants during May.
Next season’s stem buds will be
forming and early manuring will
do them good. Trim all wilted
leaves and fork in the remains
of last season’s mulch. Add
organic manure to a depth of
an inch or two. Fork in well.
Give each plant about loz. of
blood-and-bone. Finally, spread
a good thick mulch of straw
over the crowns. Four- or five-
year-old crowns should be
lifted and replanted.

A Real Mix-up.
“There was a mix-up in front of
the goal-posts after Jorgenson lost the
ball from a high pass. Sedgman
allowed his Belgian opponent only
three games in the two sets.”
—Sporting paper.
“Well, how r did you like the
game?” asked the wife, as I
hung my hat up in the hall.
“It was quite a thriller,” I
replied. “You’d have enjoyed
Jorgenson’s play, especially in
the second chukka. It was two
sets all and he only had to pot
the black for an outright win.
He’d chalked his putter, and the
ball was right in front of the
corner pocket, but he got in on
the wood and sent a low pass to
Darb, who had just shot through
on to the rails as they thundered
into the straight. Then, just as
he looked home and hosed he
goes and double-faults!
“That was bad enough, but
worse was to follow. A bumper
from Miller in the next over
caught Darb on the chin, but he
came back with a beautiful right-
cross that just got the edge of
the bat and flew straight to the
Eastern Suburbs centre three-
quarter, who took it neatly on
the half-volley, but he could only
“Can’t you take a licking like a gentleman, Wharton?”
halve the hole. You should have
heard the mob in the bleachers!
It was the third slalom
Sedgman had lost in a row, but
Jorgenson’s blood was up by this
and he slammed a double-handed
backhand over the posts for an
outright winner. There was a
sensation then as he banged
a short-pitched leg-break from
Washer very hard, but he found
the bunker. He exploded out
all right, but the referee ordered
a scrum —it wa§ a forward pass.
“There was nearly a riot as
Miller slammed one down so
short it nearly hit his toe, and
it forced Johnson back on the
ropes, but the half-time bell
saved him from being run-out.
You never saw such excite-
ment.”
“And who won?” asked the
wife.
“Well, it looked like Balmain
all the way, but just as Jorgen-
son was going back for the kick
the groundsman shifted the sight-
board for the lefthander, and he
shot another chukka. At that
stage the King’s were stroking
beautifully and only two lengths
astern when Easts’ winger ‘swal-
lowed the dummy’ and Sedgman
shot around the blind side,
whipped it to Von Nida, who
played a delicate drop-shot which
left the Balmain pack flat-footed.
The umpire signalled a four but
it was disallowed —the ball had
just touched the bails and went
out of bounds. You never saw
such tough luck!
“There was only ten minutes
left for play when McGregor,
who was pin-high from a lovely
controlled slice with his new bat,
hit his next over the baseline.
You ought to have heard the
groan from the Hill! There
was a unanimous appeal for
l.b.w, off the shot for goal, but
the ref. gave a free kick to Bondi
for shepherding the beltman
around the buoy. From the
scrum Morris played a cannon
off his backhand but it was a
‘let,’ and from the line-out Mc-
Growdie secured, but his chip-
shot went through the green.
McGregor picked up like a flash
and was using the whip
approaching the half-mile, but
Jorgenson whipped the bails off.
We thought it was all over, but
the umpire sent him back to a
neutral corner.
“At the gong Darb sprang
out into the centre of the court
and buried a perfect smash for
what looked a certain try, but
Sedgman let fly with a long left
that found the sideline, and
Pickworth sank the twenty-
footer to make it forty-thirty.
The excitement was terrific as
Hassett snapped up out of a
loose ruck and whipped it out
to McGregor at five-eighth, then
it went to Barry Darke, to
Treloar, to Mervyn Wood, but
Mervyn was only stroking thirty-
three to the minute and he
fumbled. Jorgenson grabbed it,
and with some beautiful top-of-
the-table play brought up the
score to six for two hundred.
Then he went for a big shot, but
didn’t get on to the puck cleanly
and he was forced out of bounds
near the square-leg boundary.
Under the new rules it cost him
a stroke.
“With only five minutes to
the final bell Cremin made a
brilliant weaving run up the field
but was brought down in a sand-
trap. He managed to get out of
it with a backslant, a cross-court
forehand and then a fine-leg
glance.
“There was nearly a free fight
when Jorgenson brought Cremin
down with a flying tackle from
cover-point and the ref. didn’t
notice it. That was during his
eighth successive maiden over.
Just after the captain had called
for the new ball Darb snapped
up and sent a low one to Mar-
jorie Jackson, and the Lithgow
Flyer threw him out with a
beauty from the half-way line.
That left Balmain trailing by one
chukka and three runs, but they
threw all they had into the last
minute of play and were crowd-
ing Royal Sydney’s eighteenth
green. They gave ’em everything
they had —scissors-holds which
just raised the chalk, backhand
volleys, long irons, bosies. 1
never saw such a final-minute
burst.”
“And who won?” asked the
missus.
“It was either Darb or Mc-
Growdie, though Jorgenson
could have just pipped both of
them,” I said. “I couldn’t see —
it was almost dark then.”
She pushed over the cuppa
she’d just poured out. “Well,
after all that excitement you can
do with this to revive you,” she
said.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Prices
The theory that higher prices will prove
an incentive to the man on the land to
produce more is an attractive one, but it
won’t work out in practice. The farmer
is in the business to earn a living, and if
he can get that through an increase in
prices, where is the inducement to raise
his output? A cut in prices would be
more likely to boost production, because
he would then have tp work harder to
maintain his standard of living. In the
process we would get more wheat, beef
and butter.
Wheatgrowers are now demanding
world parity for their stock- and poultry-
grain, and threats of a flour-and-bread
famine have made headlines in the daily
Press. It is only a matter of months since
milk- and butter-producers in N. S.
Wales forced higher prices out of the
community under threat of a hold-up of
supplies. Now we are told that if the
increased production so necessary to
restore our trade-balance is to be
obtained we must end price-controls on
primary products and allow the man on
the land to receive world parity.
Ironically, the fanner, who used to be
so scornful of the strike methods of the
coalminers, is now copying those methods
and getting away with it. The North
Coast farmers who came to Sydney many
years ago to unload and load coastal
freighters during a strike of wharf-
laborers would probably now put a
charge of buckshot into any coalminers
who went north to milk the cows during
a butter famine.
Apart from the immediate inflationary
effect of increased food prices and the
obvious futility of the idea as a produc-
tion incentive, it is fair to ask the farmer
if he will always be content to accept
world parity for his produce. What if
world prices fall below the cost of pro-
duction-will he be content to go on
producing for the good of the country,
drawing on the savings of the lush years
to see him through?
To be fair to the farmer, he has long
played the part of a patriot, producing
sufficient to feed the nation as well as
provide an export surplus, in spite of
fire, flood, drought and low prices. Now
he has “taken a tumble to himself,” and,
like the rest of us, is out to get as much
as he can for himself regardless of the
effect on the rest of the community.
M. F. Dixon (N.S.W.).
Psychiatry and Society
“Sydney Psychiatrist” (B. 16/4/^52)
gives an excellent decription of the situa-
tional neurosis of our moronic consumer-
goods culture. Half an hour with the
type of patient he describes and out on
to the street they go. Many of them are
camp-followers of Freudian institutes, or
are beguiled by the widespread com-
mercialisation of our womanhood
occupying three-quarters of our news-
print.
Yet “S.P.” unwittingly misrepresents
psychiatry. Half the hospital-beds in
Australia, or in any other country, are
psychiatric beds, occupied by victims of
serious mental disorders. I here is in-
sufficient staff to provide care in the
mental hospitals. A bed for a deluded
young mother with suicidal tendencies
who needs six weeks’ modern treatment
cannot be found.
Since the introduction of modern treat-
ment, the coroner’s figures for suicide
have been halved. Many major mental
disorders are curable. Yet we cannot get
men and women to devote themselves to
the sick. Soon the admission require-
ments for most hospitals will outdo a
beauty contest. General hospitals do not
cater for the multitude of mental dis-
orders, and the patient with heart-failure
who becomes confused is apt to be
certified.
The certification rate for elderly people
is very high ; hedonistic offspring will not
nurse their kin. The patients “Sydney
Psychiatrist” describes are legion, but
his description applies more to the
relatives of my own patients than to the
patients themselves. If anyone cares to
“How long do you think it'll take to empty the tank this Way ?”
scan the official classification of
psychiatric disorders in a British or
American textbook of psychiatry he
won’t find many patients who could he
on the Freudians’ couch.
My main reason in writing is to
counteract a popular misconception of
the psychiatrist as a speculative
psychologist. He is a physician with
arduous duties, who wonders like other
skilled workers whether all his training
and efforts are worth while. Unskilled
workers have this country by the throat,
and all that our forefathers fought for is
in peril. In the age when work is re-
garded as “victimisation” we are train-
ing and employing occupational
therapists! Melbourne Psychiatrist
(Vic.).
Probably, in a population of 1,500,000,
“Sydney Psychiatrist” would have enough
neurotic and other mentally-disturbed
patients to keep him fully occupied, but
they would be no more than a negligible
percentage, hardly justifying such a
general indictment.
Outside “S.P.’s” consulting-rooms
there are hundreds of thousands of
average women undisturbed by fears of
insanity, sudden death, train- or tram-
travelling or the dread of having children.
I don’t believe that any but a negligible
few of the thousands of medical students
who pass through our universities
imagine themselves to be stricken by the
diseases they study (including leprosy),
or fear they are going off their rockers.
A high percentage play prominent parts
in athletic competitions, and most of them
are normal healthy young Australians
who take in their stride what comes to
them.
As to returned servicemen: I have met
hundreds of them, including released
prisoners from German camps and
victims of Japanese brutality. In most
cases they have shown singularly little
effects of their experiences. Reluctance
to discuss their sufferings and anxiety to
get out of uniform into civvies and back
to their former jobs have been the
common manifestations.
“S.P.” is surely wide of the mark in
his comparison of the old days of large
families with present-day circumstances.
What do the infantile mortality figures
over the last 50 years tell? Does anyone
seriously contend that the trial-and-error
conditions of the past produced better
results for both mother and child than the
instruction and care which are now avail-
able to mothers and expectant mothers in
all towns of any size? The clinics do a
great job, and young mothers in all
sections of society are glad to avail them-
selves of the skilled guidance in matters
of diet and treatment of infantile ailments
which the baby-clinics provide.
Perhaps “5.P.,” busily engaged in
observation and treatment of his off-the-
beam clientele, has had no time to notice
how physically beautiful and intelligent
are the babies one can see today in the
prams and pushers accompanying the
mothers in their shopping forays
G. Elburg (N.S.W.).
Australian Industry
Every year it becomes more difficult
to decide whether Sydney’s Royal Show
is an exhibit of N. S. Wales agricultural
wealth or an industrial fair. This
question has been exercising the minds of
beef-cattle breeders, and it looks as
if they may yet hold their show
and sales at a later date, possibly at the
same time as the Sheep Show.
But even if all the agricultural exhibits
were withdrawn from the Show, it would
still rank as one of the greatest industrial
fairs in the world, Leipzig included.
That wasn’t always so. Before the
last war most of the industrial exhibits
were there to attract the attention of
country visitors, and in many cases the
goods on display were imported, or at
best only assembled in Australia. In
those days there would have been very
little reason to think that the Show could
stand alone as an industrial exhibition.
These days an overwhelming per-
centage of the manufactured goods on
display are made in Australia* and only
more astonishing than their variety is
their quality.
To those who recall the very insecure
structure of Australian secondary in-
dustry (except steel, perhaps) in the days
before Hitler marched, the array of really
first-class factory - products is most
heartening, particularly when it is realised
that, whether we like it or not, most New
Australians will eventually settle in our
cities rather than on the land.
But if our industrial progress is
heartening, the efforts of some Austra-
lians to kill it off is just the opposite.
Almost daily self-appointed critics, in or
out of State and Federal Parliaments,
warn us that such industries as the textile
industry will soon be out of business.
Indeed some of them, such as economist
Colin Clark, suggest straightout that the
textile industry should be abandoned.
A hurried tour of the new textile
factories that have been built in both
city and country would soon demonstrate
the folly of such a course. Admittedly
these industries will have to stand up to
overseas competition if they wish to sur-
vive, but they have already done so, and
the quality of their products speaks for
itself.
Remembering the past, it seems
strange for any Australian actually to
want to see any industry—whether the
bureaucrats class it as essential or in-
essential —go out of business. Whether
we like it or not, our cities are here to
stay, and as long as we have cities we
must have secondary industries to sup-
port them and their population.— Dick
Turpin (N.S.W.).
Japan Unashamed
“Ek Dum” (B. 6/2/’52) reports that the
Japanese have no sense of war-guilt, that
they are not ashamed of Pearl Harbor
and that they show little interest in stories
of p.-0.-w. ill-treatment.
Certainly Japan is no more ashamed
of its attempt to gain more territory for
its overcrowded population than is
Britain of its past action in occupying
the countries of America, Australia and
New Zealand.
A fair opinion of the treatment of
p.-0.-w. can be formed only by consider-
ing Japan’s treatment of its own people.
Because of overpopulation, one of the
first rules of life is that those who don’t
work don’t eat.
The Oriental does not give as much im-
portance to pain as do most Western
people —especially the pain of others. A
Japanese doctor will perform an opera-
tion free of charge, but anaesthetic is only
for those who can afford it. And the
patient will be hungry if his family does
not prepare his food and carry it to him.
We need to consider those points, and
view the facts through Japanese eyes, in
regard to the treatment of p.-0.-w. Many
ex-p.-0.-w. will verify that torture for the
sake of torture was not so common as
suggested by the publicity given to those
cases which did occur. It must be re-
membered also that, as in any other
armed force, only one bad officer was
required to produce a bad camp.
We must be alert for any Japanese
movement from the paths of peace, but
we should not condemn them for not
achieving the impossible. We can t expect
an overnight adoption of Western ideals
by an Oriental too poor to afford them.
