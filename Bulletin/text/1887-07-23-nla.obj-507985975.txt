THE JSULLETIN.
SATURDAY, JULY 23, 1887.
Payment of Members.
By a majority of thirty votes against nine
the Legislative Council of New Suuth Wales
has relegated the Bill providing for the pay-
ment of Parliamentary representatives to
the region of outer darkness, and .next
session the wearisome task of teaching the
leopard to change his spots must be begun
afresh. The simile is not a good one, but it
is the best that presents itself. The Upp;r
House is still, as it has always been, the re-
presentative of the combined forces of capital
and extreme old age. its voice is the voice
of “Proputty” crying in the wilderness,
and compared to the unchanging nature of
its senile policy even the spots of the leopard
are shifting and transitory. The New South
Wales Council is a museum of mental and
physical curiosities an assemblage of men
weighted down with the prejudices of the
last generation, and anchored fast by the
burden of their own gold ; and the one
order of things which seems right in their
eyes is that which prevailed in the long-
forgotten days when they were members of
the busy working community and were
forced by circumstances to keep abreast
of the age. Most of them dropped out
of the ranks at least 20 years ago, and
since then they apparently imagine the world
has ceased to move ; the fly dropped off the
chariot-wheel, and therefore of necessity
the chariot stood still. The present genera-
tion was in its cradle when many of the
councillors retired from active life, and tat
down to make laws and watch over their
“ proputty,” and simply because they have
been employed at this so 6;ig they seem-
ingly fad to realise that the wuriu has any
thing to do but sit down and watch its
“proputty’ too. The fact that the men around
them still want something when they them-
selves are t< o dd to yearn tor anything except
peace and tjUie ness and Bath chairs is beyond
their comprehension, and they stead astiy
resist c anges as a matter of principle, ac-
cordingly.
* * *
Payment of members, too, involves a
change of system which strikes at the very
root of the Council’s traditions. In this
matter more than in any other that has bean
presented to the House for many years, the
interests of “proputty” are endangered,
and here the Upper House is adamant.
Houses and lands, bank stock, mortgages,
and, in short, money in any and eveiy
form has been the governing power in New-
South Wales ever since representative go-
vernment began. Despite manhood suffrage
and the absence of property qualification,
so long as the highest function of an Austia
lian citizen is the only one which carries no
remuneration, none but comparatively rich
men, or men who can live without visible
means of support, are eligible for scats in the
Legislature. Talent, honesty, eloquence,
and legislative ability count fur nothing
unless allied with sufficient wealth to enable
the candidate to devote his time to a pursuit
which yields nothing for his support ; the
philosopher, who has spent his years in
study, and neglected the pursuit of riches
for that of knowledge, is compelled to stand
aside to make room for the whisky-seller,
the land-grabber, or the illiterate ' wretch
who jumped a rich claim in some early rush ;
and the Legislature has thus become a cor-
poration which contains little talent except
the talent for money-grubbing. The Upper
House especially is the representative of
hoarded wealth; and to the gilded' fossils of
the Council the idea of an elective Chamber,
which would represent poverty rather than
“proputty” is abhorrent in the extreme.
The strabismussed mental vision of most
of the Upper House tribe views the earner of
weekly wages as an anarchist, a social leper,
and an outcast, and a measure which would
enable this pariah to try his hand at law-
making on equal terms with-the man of for,
tune is a thing repulsive, unclean, and doubly
trebly accursed.
* * #
Payment of members, according to the
theories of the Upper House, will call into
existence a new and dangerous class of pro-
fessional politicians, and with the advent of
the professional politician honesty and
patriotism will utterly pass away. Hitherto,
notwithstanding the fact that the people’s
representative in Parliament holds the most
responsible post with which any citizen can
be entrusted, it has been an axiom in New
South Wales that he must be a mere
amateur, and the system of unpaid repre
sehtation has made statesmanship the
amusement of the retired publican’s old
age or the means of advertising the rising
lawyer rather than the fixed pursuit of men
whose life is still at its meridian. The phy-
sician who tinkers with the human frame is
expected to undergo special training to
qualify him for his work ; so, too, is the
obscure advocate who appears on behalf of
any “drunk” whose worldly assets admit
of the employment of a legal adviser, and
the clergyman who drones out feeble plati-
tudes Sunday after Sunday about mys-
teries which are beyond all human compre
hension, but which he, nevertheless,
pretends to understand ; yet the Constitution
of New South Wales affects to regard the
statesman as inferior to all these, and the
whole political system of the colony is built
on the theory that anyone who is not good
enough to be worth paying is good enough
to make laws. The officer who commands
the military forces of the colony receives a
liberal annual allowance simply because it is
recognised that ability cannot be procured
for nothing, but while the instrument is paid
the men who wield it are not. Each single
politician is a part of the great machine
which works out the destinies of the nation,
and some day the ruin or the salvation of
the state may hang upon the votes of two
or three among the crowd of ignorant
amateurs who now leave their offices or their
farms or their grog-shops to pose as the
heaven-born rulers of New South Wales,
and yet even in the face of this tremendous
responsibility it is held that the one absolute
essential of the politician is that he must be
rich enough to loaf in the Assembly without
a salary.
* * ♦
But under the present voluntary system
the professional politician of another class
unhappily contrives to exist and flourish.
The New South Wales Assembly is a gather-
ing of capitalists diversified only by the
presence here and there of an adventurer
without visible means of support, and year
after year these political vagrants eke out an
existence somehow—by the use or misuse of
the privileges of their position. Without a
salary, and without private means of any
kind, men live openly and obviously by
politics, and so well is this known that the
epithets of “swindler” and “thief” which
are launched forth in the daily quarrels
which disgrace the Legislature arouse but
little attention. Constituencies now and then
will return poor men as their representa-
tives, and these members live exactly as other
men would who were witnout means, and
were yet placed in a position which afforded
unlimited opportunities for malversation.
The professional politician exists, and the
effect of the present sj-s em is simply to
make it imp"ssible that tie can exist honestly.
According to the theory which the dotards
of the Upper House advance whenever Pay
merit of Members comes under discussion,
men should be found in abundance who
are prepared to serve their country from
motives of the purest patriotism, but after
50 years of this fallacy the patriots are still
wanting. The golden age of purity is as far off
as ever, and the colony finds itself blessed
with a mongrel House made up of three
classes—first, the men who have secured
their positions for the sake of \ ulgar
notoriety ; second, those who serve for
wages which, thanks to a system that de-
clares the labourer to be unworthy of his
hire, they procure by means that are better
left undescribed ; and, third, an almost in-
visible few who, being apparently actuated
by neither of the above motives, may be set
down, until further orders, as men who live
and work amid repulsive surroundings from
purely philanthropic motives. The first-
class preponderates ; the last is hardly
worthy of notice. This is all that 50 years of
theory has given to New South Wales, and
yet the politicians of the Legislative Council
have either not learned or are determined
to ignore the lesson that there are not
enough true patriots in a nation to fill a
Parliament.
* * *
In every walk of life, politics only ex-
cepted, it is an admitted fact that honesty
and ability must be paid for. The civil ser-
vant who offered to fill a responsible position
without salary would be instantly set down
as a man in search of an opportunity for
embezzlement ; the workman under similar
circumstances would be regarded as a dan-
gerous lunatic, and the doctor who gave his
services entirely gratis would probably gain
an unenviable reputation among the public
as a Thug ; and yet even in the nineteenth
century, in an era of scepticism and incre-
dulity, men profess to believe that politicians
can be found: m hundreds who will," from
motives of the purest patriotism, set them-
selves up as targets for the abuse and insult
of the lowest of colonial demagogues. Even
pf.,pa»ti®s-anfl the-open
abandonment of the principles of a lifetime,
even the tight of four avowed Protectionists
grasping eagerly for portfolios in a Freetrade
cabinet where Parkes takes again to his
arras the “red-hot, burning brand of shame,”
has not utterly done away with this ancient
fallacy or forced men to admit openly as
they do in secret that hypocrisy and fraud
are the only things on earth that are sold for
nothing.
* * *
To the cheap dotards of the Council, how-
ever, even the present state of things is
vastly preferable to any reform which would
tend to reduce the preponderating force of
capital in the Lower House. The aristocracy
of wealth is the most conservative of all
oligarchies, and the British House of Lords
itself, which, on a close division, can call up
one peer from his roost underneath a dry
arch and another from the sawdust of a fifth-
rate circus, would fail to comprehend its
horror of so democratic an institution as
poverty. The Council has evidently re-
solved to fight to the last rather than permit
anything so vulgar as a paid politician to
come between the wind and its nobility.
With a hollow semblance of economy, it was
urged that the nation should be directly con-
sulted before the Treasury was committed to
fresh outlay, but the pretence was a poor
one when put forward by the very men who
had effusively voted a vast sum for the erec-
tion of a dead-house and lumber room in
w hich to stack away the corpses of great men
yet unborn. The vote which followed, how-
ever, left the question just where it was, and,.
in spite of this defeat, payment of members
must ere long become part of the political
system of New South Wales. The race of
amateur politicians have had a long trial and
have been found wanting. The patriots who
—in theory—serve their country for their
country’s sake have proved to be in the
main a gang of log-rolling blasphemers, and
the policy which has restricted the nation’s
choice to the capitalists and adventurers of
the colony has produced few results to be
proud of. The Upper House may possibly
retard the progress of reform a little longer,
but its obstinacy will only hasten the time
when the Upper House itself shall be re-
formed off the face of the earth. Almost the
only wisdom it has ever shown was that
which PiddlngTon culled from the famous
Egyptian stomach, and something more re-
cent is wanted for the succesful guidance
of affairs in New South "Wales. For many
years the Council has traded on the respect
due to extreme old age, but its age has long
since ceased to bo respectable, and govern-
ment by grey-headed or bald-headed stu- J
pidity is a thing which even a slow-going
community cannot endure for ever.
Sir Henry Parkes—Imperialist and
Republican.
Within the past few weeks Sir Henry Parkes
has appeared in the two characters, so antipcdally
opposed to each other, of Saint Jingo and Centen-
ary. Last month, with well-approved fervour, he
took a leading part in celebrating the continuance
of foreign domination ; this month he indulges in
vague and vaporous dithjrambics over the hun-
dredth birthday of a nation. At heart he would
no doubt prefer to wear the buskin of the Austra-
lian patriot to the sock of the agent of Imperial-
ism ; but his official grovel must be taken as some-
tniiig in the way of gluten with which, bke the
hoa-constrictor, he spreads an ample area simply
with a view of tnabling him to swallow what
wouid be otherwise inoigesUble. Sir Henry
Parkes is no doubt a }epublican in his secret
soul, though far from a democrat. He aspires to
play the part of an Oliver Cromwell, or a
George the father of a southern
world. Many things lend a complexion to this
idea; his rumoured connection with Chartism —
which, by the way, he denies —his mi-ty rhetoric
concerning a sentiment of Australian nationality,
his conception of a State Hal), and some few of his
absurd poems. Amongst the art-treasuies of
Faulconbridge, it will be remembered, was a
highly-prized and elaborately gilt-framed auto-
graph document purporting to be the production
of that other republican autocrat —Oliver Crom
well. But Sir Henry Parkes is pledged to up-
hold a system which receives support from the
party to whom he owes his political existence. He
can never declare his real sentiments without
breaking with his only master, the Orange lodge,
hence he veils them in clumsy metaphor.
. * *
The Sydney Daily Telegraph has in its own
opinion settled the case by giving the Premier’s
latest craze a label. It is duly docketed and
slipped into its proper pigeon-hole to be known
henceforth and forever as “an unsuspected side of
the character of our leading statesman.” This
may be convenient, but it is not correct. No one
who has given the slightest study to the character
of Parkes suspects for a moment that he is
capable of any development mentally on any
other lines than those he has exhibited to the
public gaze for the past fifty years. He has been
engaged all his life in a chase after power ; to him
power is more than alcohol to the dipsomaniac.
He is utterly devoid of sentiment. That he has
written poems proves nothing. Robert Lowe
wrote poems, and the second Pitt wrote a tragedy.
Parkes wrote verses because he was intellectu-
ally ambitious ; not because he felt sentimental.
A Rojalist he was compelled to be in order to
get his foot upon the first rung of the ladder
that led to power. Now he has arrived at
the summit, he would like to play the part of a
Republican autocrat in order to have a monopoly
of the thing he so ardently loves. When he era-
‘ploys Sentiment to further his object the result is
mirth-stirring in the extreme. He is then an
acrobatic elephant exhibiting his clumsiness on a
mental tight rope—half-an-inch and overboard.
In the realm of fancy he is the blundering pea-
sant in the lady’s boudoir. His romantic ideals
savour of the purple monkey climbing on the
yellow stick —they grovel on the plane of the
cheap and the commonplace. In those composi-
tions, fearfully and wonderfully made, which he
is pleased to term poetry, he soars like a fly with
its wings in the glue-pot. The little ability Sir
Heny possesses is of an eminently unmanageable,
awkward, Saxon type of practicalness. Of ima-
gination he has nothing. He figures admirably
as the IcaeuS of the bourgeois Who attempts
flight with waxen Wings, which, if they do not
melt, carry their wearer into the leaden atmos-
phere of back-parlour romance. His very fancies
smell of the butter-tub or suggest laborious churn-
ing of other men’s minds. His rhetoric teems
with the imagery of the coalheaver, and his legisla-
tion is plethoric with the awkward plagiarisms of
the “ popular” preacher and the pettifogging con-
cepts of the shire-councillor who has made his for-
tune in “a pub.”
* * *
In his notion of a State House he shows his
strength and his weakness. His strength, be-
cause he has had occasionally the good sense to
take a hint in regard to the fathering of a legisla-
tive measure originated by a foreign State. His
weakness, because, being an arch-plagiarist he
prigs without discrimination. Ideas perfectly
good in their own places and amid their natural
environment, are lugged out of their setting and
ludicrously discredited in a fore’gn locale by the
contrast of incongruity. A State House in the
Lachlan Swamps is a statue of Jupiter in a
Chinese joss-house. Sir Henry Parkes, in that
jourr ey through the United States of which he
is for ever talking, once caught sight of the dome
of the Capitol at Washington. Since then he ha ß
had no rest. For years has he cherished this germ
of a State Hall in his copyist’s brain. For years
has he watched for an opportunity for its delivery.
A suppositious Centennial gives him the long-
hoped-for chance, and the old Parliamentarian
makes ready cnce again to play the part of a
sentimental BoxloM, and proceeds to woo the
TiTaniA of chiValric ideals in the garish glitter of
legislative publicity, assured, in his own mind,
that this display of Australian sentiment Will do
much to reinstate him in the good opinion of a
large section of that young native element so
grossly outraged by his Imperialistic buffooneries
in connection with the Jubilee celebration.
* • •
But if SL Henry Parkes is a sentimental
failure as a Republican, no less so is he a senti-
mental failure as an Imperialist. In his demo-
cratic delirium he is light-headed and skips like a
young lamb to the tabor’s sound; in his Tin-
perialistic frenzy he is heavy as lead and cum-
brous as Dr. Johnson, without any of the
Doctor’s sonorousness of expression or lucidity of
meaning. Those who remembered an article
contributed by Sir Henry Parkes to the Nine-
teenth Century of May, 1884 must have been
considerably surprised at his public utterances
concerning the Imperial Conference at the time
that august body of delegated incompetence was
tendering sycophantic flap doodle to the seraphim
that sit on the thrones of glory in Downing-street.
Turning to the article in question one cannot but
be ttruck with the resemblance in construction
and aims of the late Council to that ideally
sketched—with his usual success as an idealist—
by the present Premier of New South Wales, a
little over tin ee years ago. In this precious lucu-
bration, referring to the functions of the colonial
Governor, whom he styles the “only link” be-
tween England and the colonies, he remarks:—
“ Let it be recollected that I look to the future of the colo-
nies in all I say; and, looking to the future, I maintain the
‘ only link ’ is not strong enough to last. 1 assume that it
will be admitted on all hands that parliamentary govern-
ment in the Colonies ought to be fashioned on the grand
example of the Imperial Parliaments.”
Further on he predicts that the colonies cannot
exist as they are at present constituted for any
lengthened period of time. “ As the colonies,” he
says, “year by year increase in numbers, in
enterprise, in prosperity, and in sense of power, a
want of a more congenial bond of union will be
more and more strongly felt.” How the develop-
ment of a national sentiment and a “ sense ef
power ” nurtured within the walls of a State
House, will impel the colonies to federate with
England for military protection (especially when
we consider in regard to one of the uses to which
the State Hall will be put that we shall have
armies of our own), Sir Henry does not explain.
Federation alone, he tells us, will not meet the
want of this closer union, and —
“ Australian federation, if left to itself, will engender a
feeling which some of its advocates in England do not now
take into account.
* * •
“Australian Federation” is the bete noire of
the Imperialist, and the concluding quotation of
the preceding paragraph is a plain, unvarnished
declaration of hostility to the principle of colonial
amalgamation which Sir Henry Parkes would
sometimes like us to believe he favours, and which
he may rest assured is the only description of f edera.
tion that would ever be tolerated by the common-
sense of the Australian colonies. Colonial Feder-
ation, he goes on to say—
“ Would be the federation of the limbs almost severed
from the body of the Empire. What is wanted is a bond, or
a network of bonds, woven of the same material as that of
the central constitution ... to bind the body and the
limbs together in one great self-sustaining, consanguineous
political organism.”
As Parkes warms up to his political fad he
beats the air with even more vim and waste of
oratorical energy. He proceeds to explain the
mechanism by which he would propose to bring
about this “network of bonds”:—
“ Concurrently with federation .... a Council of
Australia should be created, to sit in London, whose func
tiers should embrace the transaction of oil political business


between the English Administration on the other side of the
globe and the Imperial Government in England. This
Council would be of the nature of the British Cabinet itself.
.... It would be consultative, deliberative, receptive,
communicative, with the freest possible scope for offering
and receiving information and counsel, explaining the ob-
jects and interpreting the wishes of the distant governments,
and assisting to reconcile conflicting interests in furtherance
of the general good of the Empire.”
* * *
He next proceeds to deal with the constitution
of such a council. It should be clothed with such
forms of dignity as would, “ together with the
importance of its duties, make the honour of
being a member of it an object of ambition to the
best men in Australasia.” The number of mem-
bers should be limited, not exceeding one for each
colony, irrespective of the difference in popula-
tion, and the electoral bodies should consist of the
members of the respective Parliaments without
distinction. He further considers that Western
Australia, although a Crown colony of but few
inhabitants, should labour under no difficulty on
that account, for before many years it would have
a constitution of its own, and burst into the
charmed Jingoistic circle as a full-fledged “limb.”
Sir Henry Pabkes thus defines the qualifications
of membership :
•> A fixed perird of service in the Legislature, or service as
a Cabinet Minister, or in the high offices of the State.”
Although he would not attach much value
"Toany qualifications, believing that the constituency
which is proposed would in every case send a good man to
London.” # #
But it is in the objects of such a council as that
jfoposed by Sir Henry Parkks and those aimed
at by the Imperial Conference which recently sat
in London, with a few trifling divergences as to
detail, that almost perfect unanimity is to be
found. Quoting Parkes article :
“ Being national in it s very conception and structure, it
would soon engender, by its own working, broad sympathies
with the progress of Australasia as a noble part of the
Empire.”
In shoH, this ancient hope of the Federationist
Tories climbs to the very apex of Imperialistic
sentiment, and becomes apotheosised as the
champion Jirgo of crazed Anglo-maniacism.
Thumping at his temporary tom-tom, be momen-
tarily forgets that he ever was suspected of hav-
ing been a Chartist: —
"In the near future—questions will arise much more
knotty than the annexation of New Guinea —the harmonis-
ing of conflicting tariffs. the influx of alien races, which is
so far from being settled, the hard impingement on Aus-
tralian interests of treaties with foreign nations, the ocean
trade of the colonies, and, above all, the attitude of the
colonies if, unhappily, Great Britain should be involved in a
great war. In the latter case the -question ought not to bej
'What protection can be extended from the mother country ?
but ‘ What aid can be rendered by Australia?' These and
many more questions of the first magnitude, some undreamt
of in our day, will come up for solution. How can they be
solved without a rupture by the old-fashioned machinery
which now exists 1 It is because I love Old England, because
I see according to my lights the grand future possible to the
English people, that I try to point out the breakers which I
think I clearly see not far ahead of our present course.”
Here is plainly announced by Sir Henry
Parkks his belief that Australia should assist the
mother country in such miserable wars as have in
the past been a disgrace to civilisation and a re-
proach to England. According to an article pub-
lished by him a little over three years ago, and
ostentatiously signed with his full name, he is
heart and soul an Imperialist of the first water,
and, according to the same article, the recent
Imperial Conference is exactly what he desired it
to be, notwithstanding his efforts to discredit its
work, possibly from motives of political jealousy.
But Sir Henry Parkes is quite as dangerous a
man to be at the bead of the affairs of a
young nation, even when indulging his senti-
ments of Australian nationality. Like all men-
tally half-emancipated men, his thoughts are ever
running upon war and the glories of victory. One
of the purposes to which he would put his great
State graveyard is the thanking of troops upon their
return from a foray—in the Soudan 2 Butreturning
to his Nineteenth Century article, the policy
which he has sketched out is never likely to be
realised in history. Sir Henry’s hope that Eng-
land’s bellicose intermeddlings with the affairs of
her neighbours will be paid for by the federated
colonies, which latter would make also a fine re-
cruiting ground for that “ thin red line ” of which
Jingo statesmen are so proud, is likely to remain
nothing more than a hope. Of course, we can
quite understand that the one thing of especial
benefit to the “mother country,” and which
would he oil and gladness to the souls of her
manufacturers, namely, “ the harmonising of
existing tariffs,” will be strenuously attempted.
Protective tariffs now prevent the importation-
in the instance of several colonies and the Cana-
dian Dominion- of England’s shoddy goods. But
“ the harmonising of existing tariffs ” is not likely
to be settled by any conference whatsoever, as it
would mean interference on the part of England
with the incidence of taxation, an interference
not likely to be tolerated without co-ordinate
Political representation,
* * *
According to the article from which we have
made copious extracts, this proposed Imperial
Conference, this ally of war and Jingoism, is a
thing after Sir Henry Parkes’ own heart, and its
recent prototype pursued the objects he thinks so
Peculiarly desirable ; it was constituted mainly on
the basis he had suggested. Whatever he may say
n °w, he has recorded in the Nineteenth Gen-
try, of three years since, that he endeavoured
by the weight of his name and the power of hi a
Pen to bring about this federal nightmare—more
terrible than the rule of even Parkes himself.
Morally he is committed. This Frankenstein
Mogo must utter no gibe, must hurl no threat at
tbe monster he has assisted to mould. Consist-
ently he cannot take a hand in besmirching its
memory, though doubtless he will do so. He
must be content henceforth to go down to pos
terity as “ Parkes, the Australian Democrat and
taperial Agent.” His State Hall cannot save ]
him, for it is awakening in the minds and recol-
lections of men a fact that the people of these colonies
cannot too deeply enshroud in oblivion the
“ origin ” which Parses now would have
them celebrate. The landing of a sickly
captain with a few expatriated criminals is
not an historical event of which any country can
be proud. The first century of Australian history,
if we date from its discovery by Cook, has already
passed ; if we date from the granting of a Consti-
tution to the parent colony, it has yet to be
achieved. And these are commemorative finger
posts worthy to be rejoiced over. Sir Henry
Pabkes should weigh well the result of celebrat-
ing a centennial, fictitious in itself, and conducive
of honour to no one. An ex-Mayor of Sydney
covered himself with ridicule by a municipal
junketing in commemoration of a Queen’s Jubilee
a year before it had been consummated. This
is the inevitable aftermath of sham senti-
ment. Sir Henry Pabkes may be gather-
ing up for his memory future curses from
those whose country he is doing his best to
connect with an ignoble past. Apart from the
question of its truth, what a satire is it to cele-
brate the birthday of a colony by founding a
national graveyard, in which the central sarco-
phagus, and the one most beautifully embellished,
shall be that of a politician whose blunders have
been legion, and whose acts of administrative
folly—are they not chronicled in the Bocks of the
Statutes of New South Wales ? But Sir Henry
has gone now too far to retreat. He has entered
the region of sentiment and flopped into the
slough of bathos. As an Imperialist he is false as
turgid, as the mouthpiece of Australian nation-
ality he is ineffective as absurd. The bells which
shall toll forth to the world on the morning of Sir
Henry’s Centennial day, will be but the echo of the
clinking of leg-irons on the rocks of Dawes Point,
one hundred years ago, and with the laying of the
last tile on the dome of Sir Henry’s State House
the colony of New South Wales will hold within
its boundaries the photosphere of its first gaol.

If we must have sentiment, let us have clean
sentiment.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The “ Honest ” Parkes Government.
The session of the New South Wales Parliament
which ended last week cannot be credited with a
single progressive enactment —retrogression is the
result. At the election which immediately pre-
ceded the meeting of Parliament, the people were
deluded into the belief that under the regime of
the “ Honest ” Parkes Government the depression
which existed would disappear like a cloud, confi-
dence would be restored, capital would be in-
vested, the unemployed artisans and labourers
would no longer have to humble themselves to the
Government for relief, and above all things job-
bery and corruption, which it was alleged had
been rampant in political circles, would be un-
known. The Government have had their oppor-
tunity, they have been slavishly followed by their
jackals, the season has been a most bountiful one,
everything has been propitious for prosperity, ye;
New South Wales .after six months’ rule of the
Parkes Government, is in a worse plight politi-
cally, financially, industrially, and in all other re-
spects, than it was on the termination of the turbu-
lent misrule of the Jellyfish Government. The Go-
vernment have passed three measures only; the
Customs Duties Act, the Centennial Celebrat on
Act, and a so-called Land Act Amendment Act.
The first supersedes a systematic tariff—one under
which articles were taxed according to value—by
a mongrel tariff which is sufficiently freetrade
in its character to satisfy the Calico Jemmies and
rag merchants in general, and protective enough
to mollify those of the Goverment supporters who
assume that they were elected as ultra-Free-
traders but who had to protect their sdats by in-
sisting that little industries in their electorates
which had had the advantage of a slight amount
of Protection should not be ruthlessly destroyed
by the removal of the duties. The Bulletin has
consistently maintained that the much talked of
property-tax is merely a PARKES-ian promise,
value nil, and events prove that this contention is
perfectly sound. At any rate, if the Government
have any serious intention of proposing a property-
tax they have studiously proceeded to work to
ensure that it shall not become law. The measure
to abolish the ad valorem duties was passed by
the Council with much jubilation, not because
members objected to such duties, but because, to
quote the words of Dr. Garr an, which embody
the burden of the song of all the other members :
“If it is true that the Treasurer can afford to dispense with
an emergency-tax, what have we to do hut to accept the
measure most thankfully?”
The Government must have recognised that, in
deliberately throwing away £400,000 of revenue—
derived in such a way that it affected no one
except the importer of shoddy and the prison-
made goods of other countries—they were offering
the representatives of property in the Council the
best possible pretext for rejecting any proposal
for direct taxation of property. The Charnel-
house Bill is one which will bring ignominy
on the author of it, and the parlia-
ment which assented to it. The gorgeous
State House will be a huge piece of monumental
mockery, particularly if no better use be found
for it than making it the resting-place of defunct
politicians whose patriotism is to be measured by
the length of their hair, or of dead tricksters
whose death-beds were impeniteat. The Land
Bill was simply intended as a sop to the squatters
to secure their support, as its only provision is
that they shall have the use of Government money
for three years at 5 per cent. They have never
asked for such a concession. What they have
asked for has been not that they should be allowed
time to pay their overdue rent, but that, practi-
cally, they should have the use of the land rent
free. The Bill is a consummate piece of folly.
With the bare record of these three measures the
Government may fairly be called the “Govern-
ment of follies.” The purity of the Government
seems to be just on a par with their folly in legis-
lation. Fortunately for them, and unfortunately
for the public, the boat in which Parkes was so
anxious that his “respected friend,” Foster,
should remain has been “ steered into the harbour
of refuge—the recess.” The revelations which
were made during the last two or three sittings
of the Assembly, and which were nearing a
climax when the Upper House flunkey tapped at
the door with his black rod and the faithful com-
moners had to attend the Governor to be told to
go about their business, would, if Parliament were
composed of men capable of independent thought
and action, be sufficient to damn any Government.
The Cremorne water frontage affair, which
from the first had an ugly, suspclious look
about it, turned out to be a downright iob. The
hasty retreat which the Government beat on the
facts being made known in itself affords conclu-
sive evidence of —to put it mildly—the extreme
folly, from a public point of view, of the proposed
transaction. It appears that all the smart land-
agentsof the city—including H. H. Brown, Martin
(Parnell’s celebrated son-in-law), and even Gar-
rett himself —have at various times been employed
to try to get the land for the syndicate, and it seems
strange, to say the least of it, that after several
successive Ministries had refused the application,
Garrett, acting on the recommendation of the
good Abigail, should approve of it. Bad as
was this business, worse remains behind. Ihe
purchase by the Government of a narrow strip of
land adjoining the A.S.N. wharf is a still shadier
transaction. The land has never been put to any
use simply because it could not be utilised for
wharfage purposes owing to its narrow frontage
and the steep incline to the street at the back of
it. It is stated on the authority of Mr. T.
Dalton, M. P., that the land was offered to the
firm of Dalton Bros, three years ago—when city
property of every description had reached the
highest value ever known—for £7OOO, and they
declined to purchase it. Mr. Dibbs, M.P., also
states that seven or eight years ago the land was
offered to the A.S.N, Co. —who might have made
some use of it —for £7500. Why the Government
should pay £29,000 or £33,000 for the property—
when the question was raised in Parliament no
Minister seemed to know the exact amount
although the transaction was completed—is at
present a mystery. Wholesale charges of corrup-
tion have been made, but pending the meeting of
Parliament, these can neither be proved nor dis-
proved. Parkes vehemently denied the accusa-
tions which were made, but he did not offer to
defer the prorogation of Parliament for a week to
admit of an inquiry by a select committee. The
purity of public life seemed a secondary considera-
tion to the convenience of the Governor who had
arranged to go to a country race meeting, and
! thence to Adelaide 1 What is the Governor paid
for if it is not to be in attendance to perform his
nominal duties when it is wise and expedient that
he should be called upon to do so 1 The truth of
the matter might have been elicited had an im-
mediate investigation taken place, but if the sus-
picions to which the surrounding circumstances
give rise are well founded, it stands to reason that
during the prolonged recess most strenuous en-
deavours will be made in the direction of “ putting
things square.”

Home Rule in North Queensland.
The North Queensland Separation Council is
bitterly disappointed at the decision of Sir Henry
Holland against the partition scheme, “ without
an affirmative resolution of the Queensland Par-
liament.” But neither the Council nor the local
leagues nor the public of North Queensland can
be described as despondent. “ We receive the in-
telligence,” says Head-centre Willmett, “ with
indignant protestand in the course of a long
circular letter on the subject, he shows plainly
that he at least hasn’t yet lost heart. The failure
of the Separationists to secure the support of
Secretary of State Holland is attributed by
Willmett to the influence of Griffith, and no
doubt Willmett is right. Griffith is the head
and front of the Queen-street party ; and it is be-
cause of the selfish localism of this organisation,
which aims at hardly anything beyond promoting
the welfare of Brisbane, that the Northerners
demand separation, so that to admit the present
demand is virtually to proclaim the guilt of him-
self and his following. In all probability Grif-
fith's visit to London (though ostensibly made in
obedience to “ the command of her Most Gracious
Majesty,” as he himself declared) was simply or-
casioned by a desire to checkmate the Separa-
tionists. However, to his presence there at the
time when their petition was under con-
sideration is assuredly due the rejection of
their prayer. But Holland must be rather a
gull to have listened to the “arguments” of
Griffith. The contention that the Queensland
Parliament should pass a resolution in favour of
Separation as a condition precedent to the grant-
ing of the Imperial sanction of such measures is
not a little absurd. It is because the Queensland
Parliament is opposed to every measure cherished
by the North that the North wants a Parliament
of its own ; and to expect a Parliament which has
been systematically unfair to the people now seek-
ing autonomy to concede the point here at issue is
ridiculous. The Imperial Act of Parliament
under which Queensland was erected into a
separate colony distinctly recognised the proba-
bility that a further separation would be desirable
in the near future; thus the Downing-street
authorities are clothed with ample power, and the
undoubted right to accede to the well-nigh unani-
mous wish of the Northeners to govern themselves
irrespective of the opinion of the Parliament at
Brisbane. It is to be hoped, therefore, that
Willmett will hammer away, and that he will be
supported with funds, in which case he must
succeed in the long run.

Aristocratic Charities.
The blue-blooded aristocracy of England are being
taught a most useful lesson by the descendant of
the Db Bressi. This frugal-minded addition to
the peerage throws open his yacht to the inspec-
tion of the public at an admission fee of two
and sixpence per head the proceeds going
towards starting an Ambulance Society and other
charitable objects. Db Bressi has evidently got
as good a business head as his father, who con-
trived to put together three or four millions ster-
ling out of the profits of navvies' labour. The
Duke of Devonshire, Lord Derby, the Duke of
Sutherland, and numerous other English aristo-
crats allow on certain days the public to visit and
view their ancestral halls ; but they have never
hit upon the happy idea of charging for admission.
What these noble persons give to charities they
give out of their own incomes—not out of gate-
money collected from the public. De Bressi
has instructed his fellow peers how to discharge
their duty in the way of supporting public chari-
ties without incurring any outlay whatsoever;
and this shows the great advantage gained by the
peerage by the occasional infusion of new blood of
the middle-class-successful-business-man charac-
ter into that splendid entity. Dickens, in one of
his letters from Italy, mentions with disgust
how the princely owner of an old palace
in that country collected door money from visi-
tors to the house of historic and artis-
tic interest. But the Italian noble was
poor—too impecunious to be able to keep his
palace decently clean without running the place on
show principles. What would Dickens have said
if the august showman had been in receipt of
£200,000 a year ? No doubt he would have in-
dulged in some slashing denunciation. Yet Db
Bkessbx’s plan is choice and works admirably. If
enables him to give with a free hand without
opening his own purse at all. The Duke o*’
Edinburgh was not so smart. His genius did not
enable him to devise any better scheme than to
charge what he gave to Australian charities to
the British Exchequer. If he had thought of De
Bbessbi’s brilliant notion he might have changed
half-a-crown ahead to the thousands who boarded
the Galatea when in Australia, and thus bagged
enough not only to give a tidy sum to every desir-
ing charity, but also to liquidate certain personal
expenses which, lacking this source of income,
had perforce to go unpaid. The only fault in He
Bressby’s modus opcrandi is that it does not
touch the local upper ten. These gentry gain ad-
mission to the Sunbeam as deadheads. It is only
the vulgar people who are called upon to pay the
two-and sixpences.

Pulsford’s War-cry.
Mr. Pulsbord, of the New South Wales Free-
trade Association, once more raises his voice on
behalf of the Calico Jemmies of York-screet. As
a specimen of calm, collected misrepresentation
his letter is worth re-printing ;
The return of imports into Sydney from January 1 to
January 9,1886 and 1887, constitute a rook on which Protec-
tion goes utterly to smash. The cry has been ‘ imports are
destroying our industries.' With the peculiar ignorance of
1 rotectionißts, the colony has been earnestly prayed to stop
these big imports, and w.th a faith that would put the pro-
phets of old to shame, we have been told that the adoption
of this course would bring work and profit alike for labour
periods named •° 0k ’ U ° W ’ at the import retut ™ for the
S £9,407.579
6,957,970
£2,449,609
This is one of the most enormous fallings off ever recorded
in the history of commerce. Has there been any corres-
ponding growth in our manufactures? These eloquent
figures teach us that the way to prosperity is not to be found
by destroying our external trade and in injuring other
people. The Protectionist prophecies being thus utterly
discredited, let me venture on the risk of a prophecy It is
that we are nearing a time of greater prosperity, and that it
will be accompanied by a large increase in our imports.”
“ With the peculiar ignorance of Protectionists"
the country has been informed that if it learns to
manufacture goods for itself it will not require to
pay other people for them, but even Mr. Puls-
bord knows well that the Protectionist has not
yet been born who asserts or believes that a fall-
ing off in the imports necessarily means increased
prosperity. Such a theory could only lead to the
conclusion that a corpse is more prosperous than a
living man, as the dead neither buy nor sell
nor import. A falling off in imports, when a
nation has learned to depend upon its own
workmen, and not on those of foreign lands,
means that internal production is increasing’
but a similar decline in a country where the tariff
is carefully framed to crush out every semblance
of local enterprise simply proves that a long
course of Freetrade has brought the people down
to a depth of poverty that they no longer
have the means to make purchases. The value of
New South Wales imports is determined chiefly
by two things—the value of her exports and the
amount of money she can conveniently borrow
and consequently we And that during four years
of exuberant borrowing (1880-1885) her total im-
ports rose from 14 to over 23 millions, while her
total exports only advanced from 15’, to 164
millions. Tne wine has been drunk and now only
the bottle remains. The imports of New South
Wales, according to Mr. Pulsbord’s own sho
mg, are decreasing, and as ihe manufactures are
not advancing the result simply proves that Free-
trade destroys one branch of national prosperity
without materially aiding the other. The asser-
tion that ‘' the Protectionist prophecies ” have
been utterly discredited ” might be true if any
Protectionist had ever prophecied that the gospel
of Freetrade according to Parkis was the
panacea for poverty and depression. As it
chanced, however, it was Mr. Pulsbord’s own
followers who declared that Parkes and Free-
trade meant prosperity, and that increased im-
ports would be the first visible sign of the coming
change. And now six months of Parkes’ policy
has apparently knocked the import trade to
shivers and of Freetrade logic hardly a vestige
remains.

A N S.W. Presbyterian Clergyman on
the Jubilee.
According to a local paper, Rev. George Hay,
at the close of a recent sermon at Cooma Presby-
terian Church on the early life of Jesus Christ,
said :
“ Probably you may expect me to say something to you
before I close with reference to the Jubilee of Queen Vic-
toria. Well, let me say that the pulpit should be no place
for the praise of humanity, bo it either in the person of
king or subject. Flattery of men forms no part of the train-
ing of the ministers of our church: and if it did, kings or
queens would be the last persons likely on which to use the
vile art. The last Sunday on which I spoke to you I referred
to the merciless and murderous attack of King Herod on
the life of King Jesus, and as I was pointing out to my
people in Adammaby to-day that the first miracle of Jesus
was the key-note to all the other miracles of his benign life *
so this deed of cruelty and enmity against the king of kings
is typical of the conduct of the kings of the earth
against that kingdom which is righteous and which
proclaims peace on earth and goodwill towards men
The darkest page in the world’s history is that which
records the deeds of kings. War, continents dyed in
blood, famine, pestilence, the cry of the widows and the
fatherless, follow m the wake of the ills of this world, and
if less of these have fallen the sceptre of Queen Victoria
it is because policy more than virtue made peace expedient
I ques ion if more misery and poverty does not now exist in
the British Empire than existed under the worst of its
rulers. The griping hand of poverty is at the throats of
millions of her subjects. Ireland is in a state of rebellion
poverty, oppression, and crime, while the poor farmers of
Scotland are ground to the very dust by oppression and ob-
noxious land laws The reign of Queen Vic
TORIA has seen quite its share of religious strife and sec-
tarian bigotry. The Church of Scotland in consequence of
the tyrannical law of patronage was rent asunder and
the rent still remains. The most marked divisions
exist in England between what are termed church-
men and dissenters, while the.e is not the slightest
evidence that the an mosity between Homan Catholics a->d
Protestants in Ireland is on the wane. In the Scanes-bcok
in the House of Commons at home and in the Homes of
Parliament in the colonies, representative government has
received a rude shock and points to a black cloud well up in
the horizon of British lioerty. The one grand mistake of
Queen Victoria s reign is her jubilee on the throne Ten
years ago she ought have handed over the crown to her Son
the Prinbe of Wales. For years she has oee , both mentally
and physically incapacitated to occupy the throne of the
British Empire, and a greater lustre would have reflected on
her name had she many years ago retired into private life
Not as a queen but as a widowed mother will the mem o,y of
Victoria be ehe-iihed. Her life has bean blamtlesi in this
respect, and -s a young wife, bereft of a true and good hus-
band, leaving to her care a numerous family to bring up to
m inhood. We accord our tribute of gratitude to the father
of the widow and the faiherless, and yet why should
we do this to her more than to ten thousand widows who
have lived as pure and blameless lives as hers, amid difticul-
ties which she never knew; and cannot know, and not the
less pure, because, like the flowers of the desert, they bloom
and lade unseen by the busy, bustling world ? At the Bar of
the great White Throne of Eternity, Queen Victoria will
occupy no more distinguished position than they. Philan-
thropy has next to nothing to record of the Queen's
generosity. Donations from £5 to £5O to such calamities as
the Bulli explosion and the late Indian famine while a Glas*
gow merchant gives his £lOO,OOO. She builds a private chapel
at Balmoral into which only a select few dare enter, and
occupies the free sittings in the parish church of Orathie.
while an Iron-master in Scotland hands over £500,000 for
supplying the religious wants of ths poor miners of the iron
districts around the second city of the Empire. After all,
what has the pulpit to do else than to re-echo concerning the
kings of this earth the words of Scripture: • Kings be wise,
be taught, kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish from
the way.'" The National Anthem wa/sung at the close.


The Republican Union-
Dear Bulletin,— A new organisation has arisen
in Sydney, which, if it he fairly well conducted, will
march. Dormant in the hearts of thousands and ac-
tively working in the minds of hundreds is the senti-
ment of Australian Nationality. In the one case
the sparks must be fanned into life ; in the other,
the scattered lights most form connection till a
mighty flame has arisen to throw a noonday light
on the path that leads to Australian Unity and
Independence. The new organisation is formed
to achieve these tasks. The newly-baptised
“Republican Union” is to fan the faint sparks into
a living flame and to fuse those now burning into
a single blaze. It is even now the harbinger of
the coming Dawn. Men need no longer eat their
hearts out in vain longings for an ideal. The
ideal has passed from the intangible into the tan-
gible. It has come from dreamland into the region
of the possible, the probable —aye, of the almost
certain. At last we can see with our waking
eyes on the distant hills the fair blue banner of
the Southern Cross beaconing the glorious pros-
pect beyond of a nationality all our own, of a
country all our own, and of a future all our own.
The might of opponents has miserably failed to
keep the prospect forever hidden; but now, when
hope begins to smile, it may be dimmed by other
agencies. Would-be but dangerous and unwise
fiiends may inter vene. Our plans must not be
blighted by the meddling of those who live by the
propagation or destruction of Christianity. Ours
is wholly a political cause which can welcome and
receive the active support of men of any and eveiy
view from Romanism to Atheism. But, in order
that no offence may be given—that no misunder-
standing may exist, it is very desirable that men
who have been peculiarly active propagandists
of any particular religious creed shall not take a
prominent part in the new organisation. This is
specially desirable in the case of men who, whether
deservedly or not, whilst notoriously carrying on a
merciless crusade against the theological opinions
of the bulk of the people, have by various reasons
rendered their sincerity—and that is where the
rub comes in—open to question. The active ad-
herence of men cf this stamp is calculated to in-
jure the cause, and to indefinitely postpone its
success. Republicanism asks not whether a man
is Jew or Gentile, Christian or anti-Christian. It
ask’s but that men shall be honest and true, recog-
nizing what powers they choose in the region of
the Supernatural so that they but subscribe to the
doctrine of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity,
in the land of the Natural. It may seem hard to
»sk, say Mr. Thomas Walker, to quietly take a
back seat; but in the great game we are playing
men count only as they are useful or the reverse.
If the interests offone be opposed to that of all,
he must be firmly asked to give way. The
cause must not be burdened on its onward march
by the weight of any Jonahs. Some men, whilst
honestly desiring to support a movement, mistake
(he best means for arriving at their object. Thus if
a man is a good Republican, but is very unpopular,
suspected of political insincerity, or of being in-
clined to humbug, the best means he can adopt to
forward the Republican idea is by becoming a
prominent opponent of it. Hence, in the present
case, it might reasonably be expected that as Mr.
Republican Walker is in the position of being
very much thus suspected, he should join the gang
of stampers-out, with the object thereby of serving
the Republican cause. No doubt the stampers-
out would receive him with open arms as an erring
sheep returned to the fold. Perhaps, too, it would
be an»advantage to him in the long run, for he
might, like Haynes, be taken in and done for by
the Orangemen. This would indeed be a happy
termination of the difficulty, for we would be glad
to see Mr. Walker’s career a safe and sure one,
blessed with peace and prosperity. But, putting
that aside, Republicanism has got to be considered.
It must go forward alone. Australia asks no man
his creed. Her cause demands only that men
shall be loyal to it. It demands the adhesion of
every true man on her broad surface, but it asks it
not from them as Christians or Freethinkers, but
as Australians. So it is with the new organisa-
tion formed to forward the cause. The Aus-
tralian Republican Union knows no man by his
theological creed. Where that crops up it will
retard the machine \ but when all shall unite only
and solely in the one noble cause of Australia for
the Australians the Union will go forward surely
and resistlessly.— Native.
The Case of Dr. Wright.
Dr. H. G. A. Wright, of Sidney, and old and
much-respected practitioner, is a fortunate
man. He was charged by a pack of reprobates
with indecently assaulting a woman, and
not alone was he honourably (and no doubt justly)
acquitted of the false charge, but the woman and
her two male friends were convicted of conspiracy
and heavily sentenced. Now, Dr. Wright has
received an illuminated address and a purse of
gold from his professional brethren, in honour of
his successful issue out of a decidedly unpleasant
situation ; and this is how the worthy medico de-
scribes the means whereby he turned the tables on
his wretched accusers :
“ When the first shock of the vile plot was over, I at once
determined to resist the attempt I clearly saw these scoun-
drels were making upon me, and I resolved tbe first thing 1
would do was to ask the advice of Mr. Fosbery, the Xo-
speotor-Oenervl of Police. X sought for him at his house and
at his - ffice, and at length found him, and on the advire he
fcli6D g ive m© X acted.. I wus blamed at tbe trial by the
prisoners’ counsel for not taking immediate action and at
ouce giving these people in charge of the police; but Mr.
Fosbery told me positively I was to do nothing but wait,
and anything that happened, however trivial, to at once
inform him of it, and hence the reason why such apparent
delay occurred. When I was summoned at the Water Police
Office I at once informed Mr. Fosbery. I saw it was a
p unfal surprise to him, hut he kindly reassured me, and said ,
*1 shall help you all I can; and he did so, and the help he
cave to me —for which I can never be too grateful—l know,
gentlemen, he would as willingly and as cheerfully g've to
any of my professional brethren we>e they eo unfortunate as
to need it To him I attribute the success that attended the
prosecution, as the witnesses would not have come forward
voluntarily, and the evidence that was conclusive of the con-
spiracy was only obtained at 7 o clock in the evening of ihe
day previous to that on which the prisoners were arrested.'
No doubt Mr. Fosbery would as willingly
and as cheerfully give to any reputable profes-
sional man help similar to that afforded Dr.
Wright, But if Dr. Wright had been not a
doctor but a mere nobody in moleskins, there is
strong possibility that he would not have had the
sense to go and gain the ear of the Inspector-
General i he would, on the other hand,
have probably suffered brutal treatment at
the hands of the police, the courts, the
gaol-officials, and even the public iuflictor
of corporal punishment. For the general
tendency is to believe always the accusers when
charges of this sort are preferred, and to have no
meicy whatever on the accused. Chief Justice
Lillby, of Queensland, in sentencing a negro at
Toowoomba the other day for indecent assault,
declared he would always award the lash in such
cases, ia addition toother harsh punitions ; and
Lilley’s Draconian and ferocious utterances
truthfully reflect the current judicial view in
Australia as to the corrective measures that
should be taken against a class of convicts respect-
ing whose guilt there is almost always grave
doubt—as is abundantly illustrated by a hundred
instances within the popular recollection. So long
as the administrators of the law show such a
strong bias in favour of “ victims,” so long will
“victims” be forthcoming with their tales of
woe. Mr. Fosbbry deserves every credit for
the part he has taken in the case of Dr. Wright,
and it is to be devoutly hoped that when a
similar case transpires he will, so far as is con-
sistent with his belief as to the merits of the case,
endeavour to regard his late action as a precedent.
MR. GODFREY MORGAN,
Editor of the DONALD (Vic.) TIMES.
(See page 14.)
The following remarks made in the New South
Wales Upper House by Mr. Watt, a leading
mercantile man and an inveterate foe of “ the
creature Protection,” will show the working men
what the real aim of the Freetraders is :
“ I know that as wages lower every 3d. or 6d. will develope
further resources, therefore we stand on a solid foundation.
If we create a false standard, as we have done in regard to
wages, and they do not give way to the great markets of the
world, we shall be in the position that we are in now ! We
have all the elements of wealth, hut this false basis has been
established that it is demoralising to work for less than Bs.
a day, and, therefore, the State has to employ men who
could find ample employment if they would accept lower
wages."
It will he noted that, according to this apostle of
greed, there is no false standard with regard to
interest on capital invested ; the doctrine
“ boiled down ” means that the earth shall be
made to yield up its wealth, and that simul-
taneously those who are already rich shall be
made richer, and those who are poor poorer.
Let the Australian workman ponder over the
statement that he is expected to “ give way to
the great market of the world ” for the benefit of
comparatively few people who have been favoured
by fortune.
*
Phil. Robinson, the English journalist and lec-
turer a la Forbes, made some sensible remarks at
the Australian Natives’ banquet to Alfred Dbakin.
Said Mr. Phil : “ He was not quite sure where
the necessity arose for an Australian Natives' As-
sociation. There must have been a reason, but it
seemed to him that if this were justified the general
public of » ngland might as well associate.” This
was a well-merited rebuke to a self-advertising
clique that has no public raison d'etre. An at-
tempt to form an Association of the natives of a
continent which will soon carry its ten, twenty,
forty, millions of souls is a preposterous sham. It
has no purpose except to promote petty “blow,”
and keep alive a foolish old prejudice against
“ new chums.” Nothing is more to be deprecated
than the latter. When an Englishman comas
12,000 miles to take up his residence in this
country, it is fair to suppose that he is above all
things anxious to be enrolled as an Australian. If
he is treated as one of ourselves his old world
superciliousness soon leaves him, and he becomes
a warm champion of the people he has deliber-
ately chosen to abide with. By the establishment
of a Natives' Associaton it is sought to impress
upon the new chum that he is an alien, denied ad-
mission to the [fold in which his children, bom
in the colonies, will be welcomed. What special
interests have Australian natives apart from the
English settlers —men who have adopted the
country from choice, and come into it as respon-
sible adults and not as irresponsible babies ? None.
But, after fall, this high-sounding Association is
not worth serious criticism. It is bossed by a hand-
ful of chatterers who breathe not the true
national spirit, but make us laughing stocks for
globe-trotters, who, perchance, {never understand
what an unreal thing is exciting their contempt.
At Goulburn (New South Wales) recently Judge
M'Farland said he did not approve of “ cruel
sentences,” and consequently he would only con-
demn William Campbell, convicted of stealing
a sheep valued at something under 10s., to four
years imprisonment with hard labour in Goulburn
gaol. He was specially lenient in this case, he ex-
plained, because the prisoner had a wife and six
young children dependent on him ! Yet it is
proven every day that William Campbell or any
one else may beat and kick his wife into insen-
sibility and probably inflict on her injuries from
which she will never entirely recover, without
getting anything worse than three months’ im-
prisonment at the outside. From this it appears
that among a “ civilised” nation alive woman is
worth exactly one-sixteenth as much as a dead
sheep. The price of a human being has gone
down a good deal since the days when slavery was
paramount in the Southern States.

Dr. Creed’s proposal to remit the question of
Payment of Members periodically to the New
South Wales constituencies would, if ever con-
creted in practice, prove most deleterious to the
Parliamentary life of the country. On the eve of
a general election instances of the moat flagitious
subornment and corruption, bribes, bids, touts,
log-rollings, and perjuries innumerable would be
committed by unscrupulous members desirous of
a vote for the continuance of their daily wage.
And how unjust it weuld be ! Once hire a man
at a monthly wage to perform certain work, you
cannot pay him one month and debate at the end
of the next whether you will do so or not. And
Dr. Creed’s proposal refers to taking a poll on
the question of continuance of payment of mem •
hers on the same day that the members them-
selves were elected. For the unfortunate man
who could not afford to serve the colony for
nothing this would be absolutely buying a pig in
a poke. Dr. Creed should for the present con-
fine his legislative attention to torpedo depart-
ments and questions affecting defence—and to
that Parliamentary Medical and Surgical Com-
mission -which he himself promoted, and which,
when once its report shall have been published,
will be the means of conferring infinite benefits
upon the sick of all classes.

It is said that a drowning man will grasp a straw,
but it is certain that a Freetrade lecturer or
writer will grasp arguments to which straws ap-
pear like the Miltonic Satan’s spear. A letter
has lately been printed in some of the papers de-
signed to show that if, in a Protectionist country,
A bought £5 of goods from B and paid him, and B
bought others from C and paid with the
same £5, and so on through the alphabet, notwith-
standing the number of hands the money passed
through it was only the same old £5 after all, and
that that country was only £5 richer than if A had
in the first place invested his coin in the prison
labour of America or the pauper labour of England.
A fallacy shallow yet plausible (on the surface) —an
argument showing either the ignorance of tbe
Freetrader or his opinion of his audience. If
money were wealth even the argument would be
false, but as it is only a medium of exchange the
thing is absurd. We will suppose that the Free-
trader in question were working for an employer
who was also his landlord, and who, in addi-
tion, kept a general store. Freetrader earns say
£3 per week, and not being a frugal man spends
exactly the same amount with (for convenience)
his employer ; his employer then, by drawing him
a cheque for the first week’s salary, could receive
and return that £3 weekly for the whole time they
were together. Would Freetrader then consider
that he earned only one £3 or 52 per annum ? Be-
sides. in the Protectionist case even Freetrade al-
lows the whole alphabet, say 23individuals, to bry
£5 of labour or goods with one £5, and forgets in
his Freetrade elysium that each one would have
to send £5 or £l3O out of the country—a vast
difference. Further, in the Freetrade country, B
and C and Co , notgetting their £5 from their neigh-
bour, might be unable to get it anywhere else,
and surely it is better to obtain it from a neigh-
bour, even to pay it to another, than to see it sent
to some foreign market whence our misspent
money, like our misspent moments, will never,
never, come back again.

A proposal has been made that the name of
New South Wales shall be changed to “Austra-
lia.” If the proposition had emanated from a
private individual it would have been beneath
notice, but as it came from the leading journal
of the colony, it is a more serious matter. It
should be noticed, and with a view of pointing out
that it is but another instance of the systematic
anti-Australian policy of the paper in question.
If the unblusbingly-advcoited robbery should by
any means receive even a considerable measure of
support, it would set the whole continent by the
ears, and would causa such a strong feeling
against the older colony on the part of the others
that the march towards Australian unity would
be for years retarded. This the S. M. Herald
seas as plainly as the noon-day sun, and that is
wherefore the audacious proposition was advo
cated in its columns. It is the cloven-hoof of
anti-Australianism once again; but, onca more,
it is too thin.
Every other day we can point to soma sonorously-
phrased political maxim or counsel in the Sydney
D. T. which every lover of freedom ought to dine
off on an emnty stomach, and every day between
every other day we can point to an equally blasti-
ferous, narrow, revolting, tyrannical, despot-
apologising, grovelling "shriek of hide-bound
Toryism that should secure for the writer
an eternity spent in Tophet with his tongue on a
monarch’s toe. This is from a recent D.T., in one
of its liberal spasms ;
“ If ever the time comes when these colonies have to con-
sider the reform or the reconstruction of their constitutions,
or the adoption of new ones adapted to altered circum-
stances, there is good reason to believe that it may be wiser
for them to give careful consideration to the American
method than to allow themselves to be bound too closely and
too blindly by the precedents of England.”
We do not know what the D.T. said on the day
following, but ths odds are 500 to 1 that it ap-
peared with a flaming leader on the beauty and
holiness of Imperial Federation, with 25 compli-
pliments to the square inch to Lord De Brkssi
thrown in.

Lady O’Shanassy, widow of Sir John, died
at the family residence, Hawthorn (Melb.), last
week. The deceased lady in her early married days
materially helped on her husband to wealth and
position. They commenced colonial life with a
small draper’s shop in Elizabeth-street, Mrs. O’S.
attending to the business while her husband
dabbled in public affairs. O’Shanassy was first
“ brought out" by the Rev. P. B. Geoghegan, the
first R.C. priest who ministered in Port Phillip.
The O’Shanassy mansion is called “ Tara ” after
the palace of the Irish kings. The late Pat.
O’Brien, not to be outdone in patriotism, begorra,
named his neighbouring seat “Kincora,” after the
residence of Brian Boru.
Unlike the rest of his episcopal brethren,
the Bishop of Newcastle (Bng.) travels third-class,
and picks up thereby a larger and more varied
stock of knowledge of men and things than if he
took occasional first-saloon trips to the other side
of the earth. He was recently travelling in a
third- class carriage, shorn of as much of his eccle-
siastical dignity as was consistent with clerical
appearance, when a gruff, black-country collier
entered the compartment, and, having filled his
pipe, and made himself generally comfortable,
remarked to his lordship, “ I reckon thou’rt a
country parson?" “I was once,” said the Bishop.

rowfully shook his bead, “ Drink, I suppose ?”

The story of the “ Octoroon ” —a reminis-
cence of the golden age when every man walloped
his own nigger—ought to have drawn well at Sydney
Opera House, hut the audiences were agonisingly
thin. The drama was well played and well staged,
but what the Sydney public want is evidently
Blood, and the manager who can scare up a five-
corpse melodrama is the one most likely to make
money. Elevating the public taste does not pay
and the man who tries it generally gets his gas
cut off and ends his days in the miserable, rheu-
matic degradation of selling the Even Noose at a
windy corner. The “ Octoroon,” however,
did its level best against adverse circumstances.
Mr. H. C, Sidney, as Salem Scudder. carried off
three-fourths of the honours, and his Yankee was a
thing of beauty and a joy forever, though perhaps
he was hardly so withered and yellow as the author
meant him to be. Mr. B. N. Jones’s Indian was
also good, but it followed some distance behind the
athletic Scudder; and Mr. Vernon, as Jacob
M Closky, was ten different kinds of a tearing
ruffian in heavy boots. For the rest, Miss Alice
Norton made a charming Octoroon, and played
with deep pathos in the closing scenes of the
drama, and Miss Bessie Collier was agreeably
commonplace in the character of Dora Sunnyside.
The “ Octoroon ” looked all along as if it would
die shortly, and it has now been replaced by ‘’Sen-
tenced to Death.”

We have just left the Sydney Gaiety, and
we ait down painfully to utter some more nice
things about the nice girls at that institution.
The theatre is now about the only place left where
our “ Constant Reader” ceases from troubling and
“ Pro Bono Publico ” is at rest, and even “ Girofle-
Girofla ” affords a welcome relief from these two
melancholy bores. The opera itself is not much,
but Verdi was at his best as Mourzauk, in a short
garment, and a pair of long brown legs. His act-
ing was far above his usual average, and his
voice, when he let it out, not only filled the build-
ing but drifted out into the street. Miss Ivanova
played well as the twin sisters, and her singing
brought down the house; and Mr. Edward Allan,
if he were only four inches taller, would be an
excellent Marasquin. Mr. Arthur Farley, too, is
well suited to the character of Don Bolero ; there is
not much singing in it, and plenty of scope for
burlesque. “Girofle-Girofla” is drawing excel-
lent houses, and the encores are numerous enough
to satisfy anybody.

“Rags and Bones” (at Sydney Royal
Standard) was originally perpetrated, we lelieve,
by one Scudamore. Regarded as a drama it is
uglier than a trodden-on sprat, and as a picture of
real life it is a failure—we could draw a better
picture ourselves on the top of cur bashed Sunday
hat in the midst of an earthquake accompanied
with rats. The hero is a fast young man who
comes home on a barrow every morning punctu-
ally at four o’clock, and the well-dressed villain
naturally wants to marry this young man’s girl.
If we were the villain we would do exactly the
same. A lot of his uncle’s money is found in the
young man’s pocket, and he strikes a pathetic
position with his head thrown back and one foot
planted in his shirt-front, or something of the
kind, and says that the other man must have put
it there. When he comes out of gaol he can’t get
any work, and he inquires down in the docks if
people breathe in his face. A sickening object in
rags steals a bone from a travelling marine store,
and remarks that he will keep it because there is
some meat on it, from which we gather that he is
not very fastidious about his diet. A well-fed
parent goes round from the first act to the last
declaring he will do something, and never doing
it. A tattered boy is interrogated for ten minutes
on the subject of grammar by the young man who
wants to know if people breathe in his face, for
the express purpose that he may fire off that pre-
Adamite gag about the plural of “ baby ” being
“ twins.” The drama contains the best fire-scene
we have witnessed for years, but its excellence is
owing entirely to Mr. Dampier’s able manage-
ment ; the cat-chorus man who perpetrated this
museum of cow-headed bosh has nothing to do
with it. Also the scenery was very fine, and the
acting—especially that of Miss Dampier as Vinnie
Foster—was worth seeing. The piece is garnished
with a donkey which has evidently studied its
part in an intelligent manner. There are five acts
of “Rags and Bones,” and the tatters and skele-
ton keep moving all the time. We saw it to the
end, and it would have been safer to prod a tiger
than to rouse us up as we got out and fled round
the corner at the rate of 10,000 miles an hour.

“ Kindred Souls ” will end its career at
Sydney Criterion on Friday next, and on Saturday

A “ Run of Luck ” is still running to
good houses at Sydney Royal. Which is only
one more proof of the luck—it surely must be
luck—of dear old Bland Halt, and of the utter un-
fathomableness of the human race.

A good mixed programme pervades
Sydney Alhambra, and the money is coming in
freely. Among the songs Miss Florence Schuler’s
Bitter Sweet,” Miss Annetta Scasi’s “ Kerry
Dance,” and “ Nelly’s Blue Eyes,” as sung by
Miss Beatrice James, are gems, and Sam Keenan
has a new comic row which he terms the
Troubles of Noah,” and which refers to the poor
old man who took Ham into the Ark. The only
thing that is wrong about Messrs. Shipp and
James, in the “French Dancing Girls,” is that
they both deserve to die, and that the piece is aw-
fully vulgar, and Perry Ryan’s “ Adonis,” which
winds up the performance, is an amusing farce
which never fails to bring down the house.

occasion, suffer no rude jar, Alfred always was

“ The Miner’s Daughter ” continues to
strike it ra f her rich at Melbourne Alexandra.
Scenery is good, supers stand around in lavish
profusion, and fiddlers have been laid on with no
niggard hand. There is nothing cheap about the
show except the prices of admission. For three
shillings, twelve little threepences, or thirty-six
bronze pennies, you can sit in the dress circle
and die of hopeless love for Carrie Swain. Victims
to the tender passion are borne reverently out be-
tween acts and buried at the management's ex-
pense. They do say that Miss Carrie goes forth
in the early morning and strews flowers on their
graves, but this statement requires corroboration.
At the Bijou Grade Plaisted is doing a limited

Talking about the malapropisms of colonial
theatrical managers we forgot to trot out a grand
old yarn. One of the fraternity opened a bottle
of his best port for a certain friend. The friend
was the man of culchaw, and as he smacked his
lips and surveyed the liquor with one eye, he
said, “ That’s a nectar for the gods!” To these
words did the theatrical manager seriously in-
cline. There was a pleasant stagey ring about
them. He wrote them down on the tablets of his
mind, to be quoted at some future time. The
time arrived. Somebody opened a bottle of fine
old crusted for the manager. He smacked his
lips, held his glass up to the light, closed one eye,
and murmured, “ ’Tis a necktie for the Lord !”

The first performance of “ Princess Ida ”
at Melbourne Princess’s, hardly went off with the
anticipated bang. When sundry performers have
been tickled with a feather, and ths chorus spread
themselves out, the new opera will be just a little
less successful than its predecessors. In “ Princess
Ida ” all the old Gilbertian conceits have lost
something of their flavour through being warmed
up again, while Sullivan has been compelled to
work away at an exhausted vein. The story of a
Princess who shuts herself up in a castle with a
crowd of maidens sworn to celibacy until a lot of
young men come along and teach them what it is
to love would be funny enough if we hadn’t seen
a similar’joke better carried out in “ lolanthe ?’’ and
“ Patience.” For the rest, the opera suggests the
“ Palace of Truth ” and an incident in “ I’ygxia
lion and Galatea.” There is enough superior
double entendre in the dialogue to mark its
authorship, hut the humour, which is mostly
forced, doesn’t seem to have entered into the soul
of many among the present company. Miss Alice
Barnett, in her old familiar character of a cast-
iron amazon, made every speech tell, but had a
poor show as a warbler. Miss Aggie Kelton,
whose style and smile are fresher than a spring
morning, triumphed in a minor part, but Miss
Colbourne-Baber’s Princess fell flat, vocally and
otherwise. Among the sterner sex Mr.
Howard Vernon was dull under depressing
conditions, Mr. Woodfleld moderately happy,
and a triumvirate of armoured scarecrows j ast
funny enough. Interest chiefly centred in the
new arrivals. Mr. Leumane, the tenor, appeared
to possess a sympathetic, cultured voice, tempered
by a slight cold. He sang one ballad in splendid
style, and then subsided into a pensive state, act-
ing mechanically when not communing with his
thoughts. Mr. Federici (an Italian of the Bill-
greeno clan) boasts an effective baritone voice and
an animated furrin method. But there were
moments when Mr. F. might have muffled his
gesticulations in a little British repose without
impairing the harmony of the scene. “ Princess
Ida” has been gorgeously mounted, and will be
extensively patronised by rank and fashion on
account of her operatic family connections. Sir
Henry Loch and our Baron assisted at the opening
ceremony.

On the same evening Miss Fanny Hobina
and the rest of Mr. Brough’s party started more
“ Little Jack Sheppard ”at the Opera House. A

the show went like a whirlwind on wires. At the
Royal another perspiring push cheered, tear-ed,
and cackled over “Shadows of a Great City,”
played by a company strong enough to pull any-
thing through. The Williamsons, clever Miss
Morris, Messrs. Titheradge, Anson, and Phil
Beck were fetched before the curtain after every
act.

The callow youth who represents the aris-

arranged himself in hi* best bib and tucker and
visited the classic hal's of tydney University last

among his blue-blooded crew. Young Australia,
however, was proof against his blandishments,
and the alphabetical secretary was told that his
organization was utterly unacceptable to the

Mr. James O’Byrne, of Pyrmont, suggests
“ Aurilania ” as the new name of N.S.W. on the
grounds of its euphoniousness, and of its being
indicative of the two chief sources of the colony’s
wealth -—aurum (gold) and lan a (wool). The idea
is an excellent one, and had it proceeded from
Governor Carington, or the De Bressi, it might
stand a chance cf adoption. It is horrible to
think, however, of what might happen if the
wicked compositor made it read “ Aurilavia.”

We have received the first number of
Australian Public Opinion (published at Syd-
ney, price threepence), and have studied ic with
interest. It is nicely printed and full of matter,
which latter peculiarity, by the way, is also
characteristic of the average carbuncle. Viewed
from a purely literary standpoint, it may be
summed up as a feeble and amateurishly-edited
sheet. The first issue contains, among other
things, a few remarks on the world-absorbing
topic of the price of meals at Mittagong, an item
about asparagus in Central Asia, “ Courts—Regal
and Vice regal” (police courts are left out), and
some figures which tend to show that there are
517,000,000 sheep in the world.
On Saturday last, the Sydney Evening
News favoured its readers with the following ac-
count of what it was pleased to call:
“ A Terrible Novelty.—Last evening a man named
Cornelius Johnson was taken to Sydney Hospital by con-
stables Stapleton and Proctor suffering from the effects of
alleged attempted strangulation. It was stated that the un-
happy man was found, suspended by the neck, and with his
legs fastened together, and a fire immediately beneath him
He had evidently attempted his life in the most determined
manner, and his tortures would have commenced hut for the
timely arrival of a friend, who rescued him from the situa
tion and informed the police.”
“ Novelty 1” Pooh! If Cornelius Johnson had
been found suspended by the legs, with his neck
fastened together, and a fire immediately beneath
him. Or it he had been found suspended by the
neck, with his legs fastened together, and the fire
immediately above him. Or if he had been found
suspended by the fire, with his legs immediately
beneath his neck. Or if he had been found sus-
pended by the neck, with his legs fastened to-
gether immediately beneath the fire. Or if he had
been found suspended by the beneath, with his
legs fastened together by his neck. Or if he had
been found suspended, with his legs fastened to-
gether by the Are, and his neck immediately
beneath him ; his tortures might have commenced,
and there might have been some novelty in
Cornelius Johnson’s attempt to terminate his life
in the most determined manner. But as the
matter stands, we fail to see any novelty in the
affair, except as far as concerns the wording of
the report in the News.

That fashionable institution, the surprise
party, has been voted a failure at Chump’s Gully
(N.S.W.), and the girls down there conclude that
there isn’t any fun in it. Chump’s Gully is not a
large place, but the upper classes there are emi-
nently genteel, and the district has burst all its
buttons in the effort to keep pace with the moral,
spiritual, and intellectual development of the age;
so when the inhabitants heard that surprise par-
ties were all the go they resolved to have one at
once. But they made a mistake in selecting Mr.
EbenezerH. Short as the party to experiment on. It
was 8 p.m., and Short, in dDhabille, was engaged
soaking his pet corn, and Mrs. Short was sitting by
the fire in a bursted dressing gown with a red
flannel chest-protector showing through it, and
the baby was being undressed on the tab’e, when
ten young gentlemen and as many ladies, all titter-
ing and all carrying refreshments, knocked loudly
at the door. Short uttered an execration, and
hastily withdrawing his corn from the tub he
stumped to the keyhole and spoke : “ Now then,
you larrikins, run away and play !”
There was loud laughter at this, and little girlish
shrieks, and Short, getting excited, yelled : “If
yer don’t go away I’ll throw the water over yer.”
“ P’r’aps Short’s a ’avin a bath in the kitchen,” said
a familiar voice outside, and Ebenezer, recogniz-
ing it, rushed back into the room and issued a
dozen orders all at once : “ M’ria, gimme my
boots, and get that undressed infant out of the way,
and chuck this bucket out, and for heaven’ sake get
out of sight yourself for you’re all busting through
that yellow gown of yours, and it won’t keep phut
down the back, and tell these children up-stairs if
they start making a row as they did last night I’ll
murder them.” Then he opened the door and the
visitors trooped in and covered the table, from
which the infant had been shifted, with cloaks and
hats and bread-and-butter, and paper bags filled
with tarts, and goloshes, and bottles of lemonade,
and told Short they had come to make a night of
it. ' Short replied that, in that case, he would go
and split some more wood and keep the fire going,
and presently he was heard in the back yard
saying excitedly : “ M’ria, them folks say they’ve
come to stay, and we haven’t any candles,” to
which the lady responded almost in tears, “ I came
out here thinking they wouldn’t stay a minute,
and now you’ll have to go up-stairs and throw my
dress out of the window or else I’ll have to wait
liere all night. Drat them vulgar surprise parties,
anyhow!” Then the bank-clerk who had got up
the entertainment said in an audible aside : “I
think we’d better give it up. Seems to me Mrs.
Short’s out in the yard, and can’t come in for
want of something to pub on,” and the lady ex-
claimed in an hysterical scream : “ D’ye hear that
young wretch ? He’s talking about my clothes ! ’
The party broke up in confusion at this point, and
Short’s baby was sick all next day through eating
the tarts they left behind in their retreat. Ac-
cording to present signs there will never be
another surprise party at Chump's Gully.
In a recent address in London, Dr. Barry,
Bishop of Sydney, lamented the absence of an

Dunedin (N.Z.) is effusive in its loyalty.
On Jubilee day a resident who was out
drinking her Majesty’s health was struck all of a
heap, as it were, by the sight of the British flag
hoisted half-mast and upside down on a temporary
flag-staff in front of a cottage, and he promptly
resolved that the man who had done this thing
should be stamped out. Accordingly he rushed
round the town until he collected 20 volunteers in
various stages of intoxication, from slightly tipsy
to weeping drunk, and this whole gang marched
to attack the enemy, singing the National Anthem
as they went and squelched the offender’s flower-
beds with their boots. Then they thundered
fiercely at the door and demanded that the gallows
wretch and heathen villain who had dared to in-
sult a beloved monarch and outrage a whole
nation out on the spree, should be thrown our to
them that they might tear him limb from limb. A
quavering voice from inside asked what was
wrong, and the infuriated troops replied that
everything was wrong and that they wanted to
get hold of the sicke-dng monster who had perpe-
trated this crime in order to then and there pound
him into hash and rags, and spill his blood upon
the road and wipe up all Dunedin with his de-
praved old head. Upon this the quavering voice
inside rose once more in shrill, feeble accents
and inquired what was the matter with the
boys, and he would tell their ma if they
didn’t go away, and a moment later a blind and
partially deaf old man of seventy or thereabouts
tottered out by the aid of a stick, and wanted to
know if there was anything wrong about the flag,
and hadn’t he put it up right, and would the
children please keep off the flowers. There was a
long pan e. and not even the most inebriated
volunteer knew what to say next. At last the
patriarch seemed to conclude he had made a mis-
take, and he called out huskily “ Puss, puss!” and
then finding that no cat responded he said
“ Whish!” in the hope of scaring off any intniding
kitten, and remarked that he didn’t want any
vegetables—this on the off chance that it might be
a Chinaman—and finally he groped his way in 'gain
and shut the door. When he was gone twenty
volunteers took their hang-dog way back into
town, and when the loyalist who had originated
the row attempted to go with them they warned
him off under pain of being kicked.

Can such things as the following really be ?
The item is extracted from the bill of a Melbourne
lawyer:—
‘‘To 15 days’ study of the works of Charles Dickens, W. M.
Thackeray, and Mark Twain, hunting for paragraphs reflect-
ing on unnamed individuals, in view of the probability that
libel actions might have been brought against the authors, 50
guineas."
Only fancy. Who wouldn’t be a lawyer now and
sit for 15 days with one’s feet on the mantelpiece
amid an ocean of beer and a bristling forest of
cigars, hunting up offensive paragraphs in the
“ Innocents Abroad,” and speculating why the un-
dressed Arab who lived in the caves of Endor
and who sold Mark a red clay pipe streaked
with 50 years' accumulation of 50 different
kinds of dirt, didn’t sue the author for libel be-
cause he commented on his smell. When the
journalist goes home to do this kind of thing he
has not Only to do it gratis, but he has to hire a
man to throw out the “constant reader” in his
stead, and when he comes back he generally finds
his locum tenens lying drunk in the waste-paper
basket amid the ruins of 15 days’ pork-pies, but
when the lawyer wants to study comic literature
he charges the job to his client at about £3 10s. a
day. And if the client declines to pay for another

N.S.W. seems to want a new name worse
every day, and as the starchy old blue-bottles of
the Council have rejected Sir Alfred Stephen’s
well-meant endeavour, the work has all to be
done over again. “ Cookland,” “ Pacifica,”
“Abigailia,” and a lot more, are too common, and
“ Parkesia ” would be an insult. “ Bullockland ”
would about express the position, and then the
inhabitants could speak Bullockese, but the name
sounds ugly, and a colony of Sheeplauders who
would discourse in Sheepese would hardly inspire
respect. There is no Washington to name the
colony after—and not even a decent Tomkinson,
and the names of the public men of the present
day—they sound as a rule too much like the clank
of the pawnbroker's sign when a driving gale
knocks the three balls together above our uncle’s
door, “ Dibbsylvania,” “Salamonsadelphia,”
“ D dleyusia ” —all are failures, and unless we fall
back on “ Beer-asia,” it is hard to tell what is to
become of a distracted colony that can’t find a
name. Or perhaps “Rumelia” might do, or
“ Gin-evra,” or “ Schnapps-alonia ; ” something
with drink in it is what N.S.W. chiefly wants ;
or “ Bungaria ” might suit a land that is fast
going bung, and then Sydney could be re-chris-
tened “Chinaman’s Hollow ’ or “ Quong’s
Gully; ” or considering how many mortgages the
Chosen People have on the land, the whole place
might simply be designated “ Moses,” and then
the vexed question might be permitted to per-
spire “ Moses” ought to be good enoughfo- any
country, and those who don’t lUe it could secede
and call their place “ Samuel.”
We know, dear Bishop, we are bad —
Our virtues are too few ;
We know that our condition’s sad —
We pay your Church no screw!
What comfort in your words there is
(To Colin Campbell’s crew) —
That colonists go in for fizz
And pay no church a screw.
You’re certain that our uppah class
In Sheol mean to stew,
Because they like a jovial glass,
And ante-up no screw.
Our unemployed—an idle “ push ”
You say, no work will do ;
They will not swag it in the bush
To pay the parson’s screw.
If things are sad, so very sad,
Return across the blue.
And help to make our people glad,
And earn an honest screw.
With joy would Government receive]
The kind advice from you
As to the way you would relieve—
Pray cable us the cue.
As to our sinful upper-crust-—
The larger field for you
To earn reward that cannot rust
Like any earthly screw.

Majesty’s dominions. He threw un a grand English
home to come out here and it is said that he
hasn’t had a red cent of screw yet, and has been
living on his private re ources. A prominent
Townsville Catholic merchant one day from his
window pointed to the Bishop, who was toiling
up the dusty street on foot, as the best Christian
he had ever met.
The Rev. W. Burridge, Wesleyan Min-
ister of Hawthorn, preached the sermon at the
;loyal Orange celebration of the 12ch July, in Mel-
bourne. Fancy a reporter coming to this ! Rur-
iridge was once a member of the reporting staff of
► the Age. So was the late Rev, Higginson, the
ipredecessor of Mrs. Webster, in the pastorate of
'the Unitarian Church. Eastern Hill. The Mel-
bourne protectionist paper has therefore given
two “priests” to the church, and a Deakin to
politics.
Waters, a Wellington (N.Z.) bankrupt,
excused his non-attendance on the date set down
for his examination in bankruptcy by informing
Judge Richmond that he had been very ill “I
can assure your Honor,” he said, “ I was then
much nearer my Eternal Judge than I am to your
Honor to-day.” His Honor, however, expressed
himself as not wholly satisfied ; he evident ly con-
sidered no other Judge so eminently qualified to
unravel the bankrupt’s financial perplexities as
himself.
James Gordon Wylie fell face downwards
in a Melbourne puddle and was miserably
drowned a few days ago. Wylie was a queer old
file, of considerable mental attainments. As a
Doctor of Philosophy, itis to be hoped that the poor
scholar accepted his fate like a philosopher should.
Nevertheless, it is sad to think that a man of
brains, not muddled with drink at the time, can
be asphyxiated in six inches of muddy water.
Many a more ignoble creature dies with three
physicians round his bed.
Sydney Echo says that “ owing to the
hesitating attitude of the Lord Chancellor, the
Colonial Conference did not succeed in enabling
the investment of trust funds in colonial inscribed
stock.” But Lord Halsbury would have no hesi-
tation in furthering investment in colonial live
stock. He has expensive estates in New Zealand,
and recently sent out a young aristocratic English
barrister named Woodfall to see how things were
going on Woodfall stayed in Melbourne for some
ime. and tried tj go: practice, bat was seized
with illness and went home again. Lord Halsbury
is better known as Sir Hardinge Giffard.
Thomas Bracken, the New Zealand poet
and popular M H.R., has been compelled by ad-
verse circumstances to file his schedule. A little
rhymekin :
Genial Thomas now you're down

Let them smile, and let them grin.
Want of cash is not a sin—
If it’s true they laugh who win,
So can they who file !
Mr. J. L. Purves, Q.C., obstinately re-
fuses to relinguish the lucrative practice of draw-
ing pleadings although he has “taken silk.” This
gross breach of professional etiquette has driven
the Victorian bar committee to the extreme verge
of desperation ; but J, L. P. smiles serenely and
simply remarks that he will do as he darned well
pleases. Mr. M’Dermott, fcir Bryan OLoghlen,
Dr. Madden, Mr. Hoot, and Mr. Hodges all refuse
the Q C. -ship so long as Mr. P. continues thus to
violate the fundamental principles of legal
“ honor.” Ha, ha I
The mercurial Mr. Dow sprung a very
ancient wheeze on his brother senators of Vic-
toria, and ne’er a member cried “chestnut!”
Gaunson was saying
that he would scorn
to row in the same
boat with Duncan
Gillies. This was
Dow’s opening. With
a well-simulated air
of hatching an origin-
al bon mot he shouted:
“You could not do it
with the same scull.”
His colleagues roared
again. They didn’t
know that Douglas
Jerrold had made the
joke historic. When
it was said that Dick-
ens and Albert Smith
rowed in the same
boat Jerrold added—
“ but with very differ-
ent sculls.”
Joe Sullivan, in-
ventor and owner of
the famous “disin-
fectant,” who died not
long since in Mel-
bourne,had hislabora-
tory in a back yard
in Fitzroy when he
was starting his busi-
ness. Information
having been given to
the police by a face-
tious friend of
Joseph’s that a
private still was being
worked on the pre-
mises, early one morn-
ing Joe was startled by the advent of half-a-dozen
plain-clothes constables who made a minute in
spection of the place, but found no distillery plant
andonlyapint of whisky, which latter had been duly
bought at a local hotel, and was now consumed by
the officers of the law.
A purse of sovereigns was being presented
in Melbourne to a young man about to remove to
Sjdney, and the Rev. D. F. Barry (late rector of
St. John’s College, Sydney University) was in the
chair. A barrister who made a speech dilated on
the learning and culture of the rev. chairman and
said that after Judge Cope had met Father Barry
the former remarked that the latter “ would make
a splendid lawyer.” The barrister thought he
would have “ brought down” the company by this
remark, but there was a solemn silence, b oken
only by the mellifluous brogue of Dan. White, the
great coachbuilder, who interjected from a dark
corner of the room, “ Begorra, he’s at somethin’
betther.”
Parkes’ speeches are rather troublesome
things to report, but they used to be a good deal
worse. Many years ago, when the dead and gone
Empire was still in existence, the old man spread
himself out in a great oration, and the Empire
compositors set it up verbatim till the “ l’s ’ gave
out, and then they went to the office of the 8 M.
Herald to borrow some more. But there they
found a perspiring workman busily engaged in
splitting ‘ H’s in two, and the worried manager
explained. “Yt s,” he said, “we also are setting
up your boss’s speech, and our 4 1’s ’ gave out an
hour ago, so now were using 4 HV cut in two.
He never uses an 4 H ’ except at 4 hawful,' so we
can spare ’em.”
The Pope has excommunicated the now
celebrated Dr. M 4 Glynn, of New York, for
saying that the Papacy was a mere money-making
machine, and Dr. M Glynn, far from being cast
down, seems rather to enjoy the fun. Mac must
be a rather level-headed man, for he has not made
the mistake —so usual under such circumstances
of discovering, after a difference of opinion with
the Pope on one point, that he had all along been
making a mistake and that Orangeism was the one
true faith. The M‘Glynn will, in other words be a
far stronger and more insidious enemy of the
Vatican in his present attitude than he would be
had he, after quarrelling with the Pope about the
Knights of Labour and the Irish question, turned
round and said that transubstantiaiion was all
flam. The Pope may formally turn him out of
the R.C. Church, but as M‘Glynn says that he
still believes in the R.C. religion, he will command
the sympathies of hundreds of thousands of mem-
bers of his faith—especially as the Knights of
Labour organisation seems to be just as virile and
compact a body as that headed by the Papacy.
Compute changes of faith are almost always to be
regarded with suspicion, though reversion to for-
mer beliefs is one of the commonest of occurrences.
For example, the late Captain Standish, formerly
Chief Commissioner of Police, at the end renounced
Freemasonry (in which powerful order he was while
in his prime a most influential man), and re-
embraced the R.C. religion from which he had
been excommunicated ipso facto on his becoming a
member of the craft. He was being attended by
Mr. T. N. Fitzgerald, the well-known surgeon,
with whom he was associated in the V. RC. One
day the Captain said to Fitzgerald, 4 ‘ Tell me can-
didly, Fitz., am I going to recover or to die ?’
44 You won’t recover,” replied the doctor, plainly.
44 Then,” said Standish, 44 send a priest to me ”
And so Father Kennedy, of Richmond, a Jesuit
priest, who was a doctor ere he became a cleric,
was tent for, and the cool captain of the twinkling
eye died in the faith of his fathers —the Strndishes
of Standish Hall.

The London Times advises temporising

Sir John Pope Hennessy is restored to

The foundation-stone of the Imperial In-

New Zealand Now, if it ever comes to pass, as
Macaulay prophesied, that a New Zealander sits

The North Queensland squatters, who pay
from £6OO to £lBOO a year each to the Govern-
ment, to the Divisional Board, and other sources,
complain that not a farthing is ever paid back to
them in any shape, and that in the dreary times
of the past four years there was no mercy shown
in collecting the dues. The money is all spent
down Sottth.
Lord Salisbury says that obstruction has
turned the British Parliament into a more sense-
less machine, and he looks forward to the time
when there will be “ a steam Irish party] an elec-
tric Ministry, and a clockwork Speaker.” We
don’t see whv this arrangement shouldn’t work our-
selves, considering how well a wooden teetotum
passes for a Premier.
Parkes is having a gay time of it with 827
gentlemen—more or less gentlemen—who have
put in applications to be made J.’sP. of N.S.
Wales. He is devoting the recess to going through
them alphabetically, and has got as far as “ B.”
There are 76 B.’s on the list. Also there are 55
Mac’s, and the mao-nitude of the task is likely to
keep him hard at it for several weeks.
At the banquet given Mr. Deakin by the

In climates having a difference of tempera-

Breeding ferrets for the State is the
latest rosy game in N.Z. The ferrets are sold
to the Government, which distributes them among
the farms and stations, where they kill the poul-
try, eat out babies’ eyes, and intermarry with the
rabbits. The farmers who don’t want ferrets
catch them and sell them to the breeders. The
latter sell them again to the Government at a big
profit, and so the business goes on.
The Chinese at present have the Russell
River (Q.) goldfield all to themselves, and as the
track to the diggiugs is very rough, arid they are
anxious to avoid any disappointments, these
thoughtful Chinkies have sent word that there
isn’t enough gold to make it worth while for white
men to go there. Of course, when the finds in-
crease sufficiently to give a white man a show the
Chinese will be sure to let them know.
It seems to be a mystery that the Northern
digger who howls so loudly about the kanaka he
has never seen should calmly swallow the China-
men who are around him on every side. But the
diggers’ wives don’t care a clothes-peg for the
political side of the matter. So they get their
vegetables from the only people who supply them,
and the miner, when his account gets big with the
white merchant, pays cash to the yellow one.
Human nature is weak. The digger’s wife must,
by anti-Chnese legislation, be protected against
herself.


A SLANDERED COUNCIL.
1 here were some good rnd able men in the
majority, no doubt. Nobody will be found to
sneer at the capacity and reputation of such
men as Dr. Gaeean, Mr Suitor, and Mr.
Simp.-on ; but if the list of the 30 be read down
nobody will be found stupid enough to maintain
that the average is equal to that of the minority.
Among the nine ayes we find Sir Alfred
Stephen, Mr. Dalley, Mr. Barton, Mr. Salo-
mons and Mr. Watt. Back of the votes we
see convictions, and back of the convictions we
see more than ordinary brains. Js mong the SO
there were some appalling countenances —appall-
ing, that is to say, when it is remembeied that
the owners of these countenances have been en-
trusted with the responsibility and power of
making laws for a young nation. The uncon-
cealed joy with which these gentlemen ranged
themselves agaimt a measure which was in-
tendtd to secure a fuller representation of the
people really announced the coming and inevit-
able extinction of a House so constituted. —

The Bulletin, however much its opinior s may differ from

most convincing signs of culture and good humour. The sweep-

Woman, we believe, has her good points,
but telling the truth about her age is not one of
them, and it is a recognised fact that any mean,
horrid male .thing who seeks to pry into this ques-
tion is no gentleman. The N.S.W. Education De-
partment sent round circulars recently to all the
lady teachers asking them in respectful not to say
diplomatic terms, to mention how old they were,
and several hundred raging females on their last
legs respond that they were exactly 25. They had
an idea, you see, that the Government wanted the
information so that it might come round when it
had nothing to do and wink at them, and
call them “ old girl,” or ask “ Who's
yer hatter?” or that the documents would be
read out in Parliament, and then the House would
adjourn singing “Oh, my, here’s a gorgeous girl|!”
or else they thought that wicked old creature
Parkes, when he had to rise early- and dress hy
candle-light so as to go down and look after his
bleeding country on a cold morning,, would take a
pocketful of their letters to read as he
swore himself along to his work, and
would show them round to all his pals. But
unfortunately, it was nothing of the kind. The
Government simply wanted to pension off all the
ladies when they got old, and now the giddy
thing of 45, who put herself down as 25, finds
that she will have to labour at spanking girls
twice as large as herself till she is 80 before the
department will recognise her asbeing even GO. Con-
sequently, the feelings of these unhappy middle-
aged ladies are now a mixture of agony and
wrath, hunger, tears, and Paris-green, and it is
rumoured that they are getting up a return cir-
cular which runs thus :—“ Sir, —Owing to a
clerical error I stated my age as 25, whereas, not
to put too fine a point upon it, it should have
been, as I might almost say, 45. I enclose my
photo, from which you will see that I look very
young for my age.” This ought to set the matter
right, unless the confidence of the department is
so much shaken that it will be necessary to send
an inspector round to judge the age of the ladies by
their teeth.

There is one prisoner in particular in the
Maitland (N.S.W.) Gaol who rises up and uses lan-
guage when anybody says ‘ ‘ Jubilee ” in his hearing.
In that festive establishment the prisoners were
permitted to spend (if they had it, of course) the
important sum of five shillings in honour of the
Jub. One sick law-breaker purchased some
apples to make a pie (poor devil !) and invited his
fellow-sufferers to share it. They were all sitting
awaiting the serving of the bonne bouche, when a
Jubilee warder (that’s the worst adjective we can
think of for him) appeared, espied the pie, and,
seeing insubordination, mutiny, and, Heaven
knows what else in its pastry cover, he, “ with
breathless speed-like a soul in chase, just took it
up and ran.” The next thing was that the owner
of the pie and his erstwhile guests were marched
off to the solitary cells to await the charge of
having an apple in their possession. After pars-
ing two days in unmerited- darkness they ■were
hauled before the visiting justice, who instantly
dismissed the case without even calling on the
Jubilee warder. The pie, however, was not re-
stored to its rightful owner, but was given to a
prison official. The warder received no punish-
ment at all, though he unlawfully and treasonably
deprived that poor convict of his Jubilee pie.
That is the reason why one prisoner in Maitland
“ jug ” smiles when they say “ Jubilee. ’

The S.M. Herald, which is now probably
sub edited by a gentleman named Terence O’Hooli-
gan, says:—“The short midday service at St.

man who stood up and said that the next song
would be a dance, must now take a back seat,

He had spent most of his life in dull soli-
tude at Burrumbeat (Vic.), and so when he bade
his family farewell and started to pay his rich
Melbourne brother a visit, the sights of
the metropolis were to him like Paradise.
The shops dazzled him, the theatres ele-
vated him far ab we sordid thoughts of beef
and slaughtering, and the end of it was that he
outstayed his welcome. One day his brother said,
“Don’t you think, Tom, that your wife and
children must miss you But he did not see the
hint. Taking it as a kind suggestion, the town-
struck arcadian grasped his relative’s paw and
stammered, “ Thanks, Bill, thanks; I'll send fov
’em /” .

All this happened in a swagger Sydney
oyster restaurant. A lavish patron of the luscious
bivalve had been consuming them on the half-
shell to the ext ant of one or two dozens and when
he took his departure found that he had left a good
silk umbrella behind him. Not wishing to lose
his cherished Nagasaki he went back and cate-
chised the waiters, who, to a man, vowed that he
had lost: he article elsewhere. Being quite sure
that he bad lost it in the saloon he spoke to the
proprietor, “ How much do you value the article
a t, Mr. ?” said that dignitary. Theloser named
the sum. “ Very well. Then I shall stop it out
of those rascals’ wages.” The next day the gamp
was returned to the owner. One of the waiters
had found it. Yes.

Truth is stranger than a lot of things. In
Sydney recently lived a father, mother, and
daughter, and to board with them came a dude
from Merrie England, with pale-blue eyes and a
straw-coloured moustache. The dude, being im-
pressionable, began to lay siege to the affections
of the daughter, the amour being kept under the
rose. The mother, alas ! entertained a (let us say)
weakness also for the boarder, and found many
occasions to hint that, as “ her No 2, he would
not only be welcome, but too utterly utter. Just
now the insignificant male motive of the establish-
ment, being bald-headed with care and time, be-
came moribund, and the straw-coloured dude per-
ceived a crisis. The poor old man had scarcely
got to the’Golden Shore when the widow, who aped
juvenility and wore a bang, informed the wretched
dude, as she backed him up against the piano and
fell into his unwilling embrace, that now indeed
she would be his ownest duck, and nothing short
of the gentleman with the scythe would separate
them. Seeing that discretion is (for a dude) the
better part of valour, the dude assented to all this,
and even did a modified rapture on his own hook.
That night, however, the straw-coloured masher,
who really had concealed somewhere about his
person a kind of toffeeish feeling for the daughter,
informed her that her mamma had “ spoke a pre-
ference ’ for himself, and he really couldn't see
how they could become one under the circum-
stances unless they eloped. The daughter was
“game,” and so one night when the widow lay
awake speculating as to whether she would wear
a pink or a cream silk at the ceremony, the groom
of her dreams, together with her minx of a
daughter, were romantically meandering down
the back-lane each with a carpet-bag full of the
most unnecessary articles they could pack into it-
In the morning they were missed. A wire later
on in the day confirmed the widow’s worst fears
—they were married. Not to exaggerate matters,
the relic exhibited some emotion over the matter.
Indeed, so much did she feel for the loss of this
straw-coloured son of Albion that, six or eight
months after the wedding She threw up the sponge
and (to be vulgar) went—this in the elegant lingo
of the South Sea slavers—“right off her kadoova. ’
THE REASON WHY.
FRIEND (to party in undignified position): “HULLO, MR. A! WHY DON’T YOU GET
UP?”
MR. A. : “WHAT’S USHE GETTING UP TO TUMBLE DOWN AGAINSH?”
Mary Ann Blazzard, of Sydney, had a
bailiff-a whole one—put into her house on July
4, and on July 5 she seems to have fired out half a
bailiff with a black eye, that being all that was
left of him. The story of this half bailiff, as told
by Mary Ann herself, is short and pathetic. He
stood some beer for her at the commencement of
his wild career in the Blazzard mansion, and re-
quested the lady to “ make a fire and be sociable.”
She asked him if he was married, and he said he
was not. Then the two sat down together and
“ talked about noble personages, particularly the
Prince of Wales.” and as talking about Wales is
enough to demoralise anybody, it is not surprising
to hear it’ alleged, whether truly or untruly,
that the bailiff presently began to lark with Mary
Ann. The next thing he heard was a noise like
somebody being put out, accompanied by a yelp
of surprise and a concussion as if a door had
struck the patient in the eye, and when he had
time to collect his thoughts he "found it was his

There is nothing that upsets some people
more than formality. They can be as familiar as
you please, but directly it comes to ceremony they
lose their heads and go to sea generally. This is
mixed metaphor, bat it serves to introduce an in-
cident that occurred in a high-toned Sydney
drawing-room the other day. A mother and
daughter were attending for the first time the
“at home” of a starchy hostess, and so upset
were these simple folk at the “ prunes and
prism” of the select company assembled that upon
taking leave they actually shook hands with each
other, under the impression that they were total
strangers ! This serves to sho w the fathomless
state of mental whirlpool now reached in the
salons of the city of the Beautiful Harbour.
The latest fashionable paints and powders

of bookmakers reminds us that sassiety has lost

This is what a Melbourne “ greaser ” says
about Lady Loch, dressed up as Queen Elizabeth :
—“As one looked at her regal figure, attired in
ruff and farthingale (a farthing ale was the
mediaeval equivalent of the modern threepenny
beer) visions of the golden age of English history
floated before the mental vision.” Am. ng all his
visions this butter-slinger was most impressed
with the vision of Mary Stuart on the scaffold.
The whole gory tragedy was enacted in _ his
mind’s eye as he looked at Lady Loch. He piped
off “the headsman leaning upon his axe, which is
presently to sever the fair, frail head from the
body of the Queen of Scotland and of France. The
blow falls, the head, with its &c., &c. falls on the
bare boards, and the rich blood of the Stuarts is
lapped by a little dog.” After filling in an inci-
dental verse, the visionist enquires “are these
musings too sad ?” Sad isn’t the word. They re
just sickening. The idea of mixing up dear lady
Loch with the rich blood of the Stuarts, a little
dawg, and the Elizabethian “ Nosey Bob I” Ugh !

The Wellington (N.Z.) papers are jubilant
over another “ smart capture ” by one of the
local detectives. In this case a young “ spieler,”
having forged a letter of introduction from a
Gisborne lawyer, passed himself off on a confiding
hotelkeeper as “ LordTelfer,” heir to vast estates in
England. The landlord boarded him for a month
at the rate of a thousand a year without seeing
the colour of his coin, and then discovered that
his credentials were bogus. Having informed a
detective of this fact, and shown him the room in
which to find him, the “ astute officer ” arrested
him at once, and, having searched his luggage,
discovered that his “ lordship ” was the person he
had been hunting after for several weeks for com-
mitting numerou? burglaries all over the town.
And the local Press is beside itself with admira-
tion over this wonderfully smart capture.

According to the Helena Independent
a good time has dawned for the oppressed hus-
bands of Montana. The legislature of that U topia
has drawn up an “ act for the better protection of
married men,” which runs like this: —
“ Section 1. That hereafter it shall be a misdemeanour
for any married woman to purchase a new bonnet, a silk
dress, or a sealskin sacque unless she shall first obtain a
written order from her husband, and shall furtt er have
given him an indemnifying bond for the payment of the
same. „ . , ,
“ Section 2. That, in consideration of extra rights, privi-
leges, and immunities heretofore mentioned, it shall here-
after be lawful for any husband to stay out at least three
times a week until 12 o’clock at midnight, and if any married
woman shall utter any complaints she shall be adjudged
guilty of a misdemeanour, and shall be punished by being
prohibited from making any comment upon the bonnet of
the lady who occupies the front pew in church.
“ Section 3. In addition to the three nights above provided,
married men may be permitted to attend lodge on Monday,
Wednesday, and Saturday nights, respectively, of each week,
and said lodges are hereby permitted to keep open until
2 a.m., and any married woman who shall lock the front
door or leave the baby-carriage in the hall, or put out the
lights prior to 2 a m , shall be denied the privelege of gossip-
ing with any other lady for the period of six months.
“Section 4. Hereafter it shall be unlawful for any marr led
woman to do any of the following acts more than twice in
one day, to wit— . ~
“1. To pull out more than one handful of hair at a time.
“ 2. To strike him with a rolling-pin more than 17 times in
succession.
“ 3. To throw hot water on him.
“4. To throw m ire than one flat-iron at a time.’
Why! it must be absolutely pleasant to be
married in Montana!

about the “ hunemployed,” his lordship “ could
not presume to give advice as to the best means

unkind. He should have driven down to the

that there has been corresponding industrial de-
velopment. But a “Common Carpenter” hits
Pulsford fairly on the head when he points out, in
a letter to the D.T., that the decrease of imports
is attributable to the decrease of the purchasing
power of the community, as the great body of pro-
ducers have not been able to get remunerative
employment. The mce Pulsford plunges info

At the evictions on the estate of Colonel
O’Callaghan in county Clare, Ireland, the officers
of the la*v were repelled with showers of porridge
and hot water, and had to put up their umbrellas.
This event reminds us, though in a remote sort of
way, of the adventure of a Queensland colonist
who was assailed, not with porridge but with
treacle, but the cases were hardly parallel, for he
had no umbrella Also he had no clothes on and
was as naked as a skinned eel. He came down
from the far North to marry a little Brisbane
widow, and when her dozen or so of admirers dis-
covered what was going on they felt hurt and
vengeful, which circumstance accounted to some
extent for the presence of a South Sea wooden
god attired in a night-dress and with a cap tied
neatly under its chin in the bridegroom’s couch
the night before the ceremony. This apparition
gave him a shock, but when he recovered he
banged the god’s head against the wall and turned
in. Next morning he awoke, feeling as if he were
going to be hanged. He had been drinking the
widow’s health a good deal, and his head felt like
the head of a total stranger, and his ears seemed
to be breaking right off. So he rose sadly, and
with a parting kick at the wooden god, he
scrambled into a primitive contrivance which
answered for a shower-bath at the hotel, and
which some thoughtful friends had filled with
treacle and water, especially treacle. Then there
arose a perfect hurricane of blasphemy, and a red-
spotted man got out and tried to wipe himself on
the wall, and the floor, and the ceiling, while he
called down anathemas, and vitriol, and blue
paint on the wretch who had played this trick,
and finally he flew to the bell, and hung on it
with such energy that his legs stuck straight out
from the wall as if they had been blown out by a
heavy gale. But the bell had been muffled with
a stocking, and the Chinese waiter, who ordinarily
worked the pump (by which the shower-bath was
filled) when he heard the bell ring, had been kid-
napped ; so after yelling through the keyhole
that he would keel-haul that yellow catamaran,
the sticky man swore himself into his clothes and
went out to look for gore. When at last the at-
tendant Chinkie was found the matter was laid
before him in a way that nearly burst a blood-
vessel, but even to this day that heathen doesn’t
know exactly what the white gentleman was so
angry about,

Some time ago—its a good while ago now,
but that’s all the better—there were private
theatricals at Government House, Yarrangaboola,
in aid of some fund or other. One amateur mem
ber (male) paid great attention to some of the pro-
fessional actresses in the affair—so much so that
one of them inserted an advertisement in one of
the papers. The advertisement purported to be
signed by the gay Lothario, and ran as follows :
“Wanted, immediately, for an unmarried gentle-
man, a housekeeper, must be young and good
looking.” And applicants were told to apply at
11 a m , at the offices of a certain large city firm
where this gentleman carried on his business.
Words fail for what followed. The purlieus of
the Southern Babylon rose en masse, and Blank-
street came down like one female. They came on
foot, they came in cabs ; singly, and in couples ;
drunk and sober ; plain and pretty. The victim
of the joke fled after ten minutes of it and left
two of his friends to receive the somewhat im-
pressive ladies. When these latter found it was a
sell they “took on awful,” and quarrelled, and
used nasty language, and said they had come
from Adelaide, they had, and meant to be en-
gaged. However, they were finally persuaded to
retire, and peace once more reigned.

exist not far from the metropolis, for in a tram

The Melbourne medical students gave a
fancy dress ball recently and candidates for
t'ckets had to go before a committee of ladies.
The patient would be looked at carefully, and
then one charming dear would whisper to
another, “Oh, we shan’t have that nasty old
taing,” to which the other would respond, “I
assure you, my love, 'Mr. IVown is so nice.”
Sometimes the miserable applicant would hear
these remarks, and then the happy look in his
face was worth making a note of. The ball, how-
ever, was a success. One aesthetic reporter states
that the refreshments were exceedingly “ chic ”
we presume this means in English that there were
pigs’ feet—and the costumes were very pretty. A
skeleton and a devil were among the most pro-

Victoria to Mrs. Balilie if she had only asked
for it.
Bishop Goe says that he is certain from
what he has seen in Australia that a State church
is a necessity here. This is very curious. In the
flrst place, State churches are just about upon the
eve of making their wills even in England and
Scotland; and secondly, for any sane person,
oven a bishop, t) say tha*-, from wnat he has
observed in Australia, a State church is a re-
quired article, smacks so much of Bloomsbury and
within sound of Bow Bells that no wonder every-
one is surprised at his reverence having learnt
nothing better from his residence in Australia than
that.
The Payment of Members Bill was igno-
mioiously rejected by the N S.W. Upper House,
owing in a great measure to the half-hearted way
n which it was dealt with by Salomons whose
speech showed that he was opposed to the prin-
ciple, and who, it is said, had no compunction in
telling members privately that he did not believe
in it. Dailey and Barton were the only two mem-
bers who spoke with any fervour in favour of the
bill. Ths vote agaimt the second reading was 30
to 9-the largest vote ever recorded. The next
occasion when the gouty old gentlemen will be
carried bodiiy into iho chamber will be when it
becomes necessary to save the country by rejecting
Parkes’ property tax.
The Argus (Melb.) has been obliged to
chaw up its own words in a most humiliating
manner. The Rev. Ewing, of Toorak, said that
Queen Victoria sent the Bibles to the Victorian
State school youngsters because she had heard
that the Book was banned by the Government
Education Department, The Argus said this
was a lie, and that Ewing was an hallucinator.
the Toorak parson responded that he had read the
hirg in the Argus, and sure enough that paper
h\d published a letter from the promoters of the
idea in England saying that the Queen refused to
send the Testaments until Lord Harrowby told
her that the poor little State school children of
Victoria were Bibleless.
A curious story is going round in London
about Ashmead-Bartlett, who married the ancient
Baroness Burdett-Coutts, and seems to have been
sorry for it ever since. There was a close division
looming in the Commons, and towards midnight
the Whip drove to Asbmead s residence and hung
on to the bell, and yelled to the member to come
down and vote. The young man’s gray-haired
wife put her head out of the window and told him
to go away. “But I want Mr. Bartlett to come
down to the House at once ; I can’t get him a
pair,” said the official, “Well, he’s in my house
and has paired for the night,” snap; ed out the
grand old woman up above, and the window
closed with a bang just as the member was heard
plaintively observing from the background that he
must go just this once, please, my dear.

“ Mr. Abington ” (Baird) owner of the
English Derby winner, before he dropped into his
father’s coin, eked out his income by leather-
flapping at tradesmen’s race meetings, and many
a cross is on record against him. He was
“warned off” once for “coming the captain,”
and directly dad died turned the lawns and parks
into a tan-track so that his horses could practise
in front of the drawing-room window. £BO,OOO a
year covers a multitude of sins, however, and
“Abby” has the credit of being the only man
confederating with the celebrated “ Bob Peck ”
who has not lost money thereby. He rides as a
professional jock., is called “Archer 2nd,” and
has often out-jockeyed the late prince of jockeys.

Two flagrantly unjust decisions were given
by the learned judges at minor Melbourne race
meetings last week. If a system of awarding a
race to other than the leading nag were generally
adopted it would make the glorious uncertainty
of the turf a bit more glorious than ever. Just as
horses are passing the post we may hear the
cheery “books” warbling, “I'll take odds and
back the that's beaten off.”

erstwhile slow-coach the aitangi, has given
George Hills, the crack builder and boat sailer, an
order for a 10-tonner. Mr. “ Jack ” Want is also

It will astonish those not “in the know
to learn that in the professional footraces now-a-
days more money can be won in wagers, and can
be got on at a better price, than in many of the
big horse-races. £5OOO at a hundred to two can
be obtained about almost any competitor when
the handicap leaves things fairly open. Not
above half-a-dozen out of the scores that compete
are “on the job.” But the secret of the popu-
larity of these handicaps is that the general public
can easily get to know something about the com-
petitors, and get “ straight tips/’ then they roll
up and back their fancies, because if there is one
thing more attractive to the sporting ’Arry than
another it is the idea that there is a swindle on,
and that he is going to be “in it.” In horse
racing they stand in mortal dread of the owner,
but here the competitors come from among them-
selves, and they are not —or think they are not
so much in the dark. What the noble Australian
public like is not a fair and square foot-race, but a
good old swindle where some man who cm do
“ even time ’ is on the limit and they (the public)
have backed him.
* * *
The Bulletin is about the only paper in
Australia which has consistently insisted upon the
marked superiority of English professional ormket
over tho so-called amateur article, pointing out
that the visits of Australian teams had stirred up
the former to assert its ancient supremacy We
now learn by cable that the Players have defeated
the Gentlemen by an innings and 122 runs.
Shrewsbury’s individual score of 111 equalled the
Gentleman’s total in their fii st innings. In the
face of this, the action of the Melbourne Club in
offering £BOO and £l5OO “bonuses” to Messrs.
Read and Grace is simply ridiculous. Evidently
Shrewsbury and his following laid themselves out
to demonstrate that they are entitled to rank as
the best exponents of English cricket, and deter-
mined to knock the stuffing out of the show which
the Melbourne people are trying to bolster up by
preliminary puffs.

Harry Dunn, who was so mauled by
Cannon at the Grseco-Roman game, is to get a

atrocities will ha permitted in Melbourne, except
under police supervision.

Everyone, and his wife also, has heard of

the tale of a bazaar in the Riverina district at
which a visitor went into a raffle for a blood colt
and won. On calling round for his prize, the lady

Mr. Godfrey Morgan.
The attached portrait shows Mr. Godfrey Morgan
of the Donald (Vic.) Times, aged about 50, and as
good as new. He passed his early years in the
English city of Bath, where he was employed in a
library, and made the acquaintance of Charles
Dickens, Walter Savage Landor, Martin Tupper,
and many other celebrities. In 1852 he left Eng-
land for Australia, and served for two years on
the staff of that solid old journal, the Melbourne
Argus, He afterwards went up country, and
acted as canvasser, reporter, and pressman on the
Maryborough advertiser, Dunolly Adver-
tiser, Chinaman Flat Advertiser, Ararat
Advertiser, Pleasant Creek Advertiser, and
Lamplough Advertiser— Victorian papers were
pretty nearly all Advertisers in those days. In
1860 he started the Moonambel Pioneer, in 1865
the Landsborough Times, and in 1875 the
Donald Times, which he still owns Mr. Mor-
gan is also the founder ef the Donald Progress
Association, secretary of the Jockey Club, mem-
ber of the Board of Advice in educational matters,
and ether things too numerous to mention.
Mr. John Weatherall.
The accompanying features are meant for those of
Mr. John Weatherall, proprietor and editor of the
Mount Bengok Mail, published at Roxburgh,
N.Z. Mr. Weatherall was born at Bendigo (Vic.)
in 1858, when the glory still hung over Kangaroo
Flat and life was worth living, but he migrated
to New Zealand at an early age and started his
journalistic career at the office of the Tuapeka
Times, published at Lawrence, a bleak spot in
Central Otago, where a lot of people still keep on
looking for gold and seldom finding it. At the
age of 22 he founded the Mount Bengor Mail
with which he has been connected ever since.
Ha-algo held an interest in the Otago Central
'JjEAder and Tuapeka Press, both of which
burst through over-competition. Mr. Weatherall
is now 28 years of age, and in spite of an
eminently rheumatic climate, both he and his
paper are prospering.
Who made “Parkes’s Gal” a censor of
men ? Lloyd may sneer at Melville, but the politi-
cal worth of the Utter as compared with his own
is as that of gold as against brass.
Poor old Dan Cassin, of Mudgee, the
political sponsor of Mud J. Haynes, says “he
feels proud that it has fallen to his lot to intro-
duce such a man to political life.” Some mm are
easily pleased.
Mr. Phil. Robinson, the London Daily
Telegraph war correspondent, is staying at the
Melbourne Club. His manager, Mr, R. S. Smythe,
says that he could have secured quarters for his
protege at Government House if he had liked.
The Sydney Primrose League, which con-
sists mainly of parsons, dudes, Tory lawyers, and
other old women, has proclaimed in favour of the
Irish Coercion bill. It might just as well proclaim
in favour of wife-beating, or the re-building of
Babylon.
Mr. John Farrell, late of Queanbeyan, the
now celebrated author of “How He Died,” has
settled down at Lithgow as editor and proprietor
of the local Enterprise. The Bulletin, for
which Mr. Farrell’s intensely Australian spirit has
done not less than his enviable mastery of the arts
of versification, cordially wishes him every
success.
Jubilee sovereigns have reached Mel-
bourne. The local impression is that they were
designed by the Sydney Post Office carvings man.
The annual dinner of the Yorick Club
(Melb.), held on last Saturday night, was a splen-
did success. Mr. Phil llob’nson, the London
Daily Telegraph war correspondent, responded
to several toasts. Absent pressmen were not for-
gotten.
The Bulletin learns from private letters
that the reason why Her Gracious on Jubilee Day
only made a semi-State progress to Westminster
Abbey was on account of the absence of Plain
Bill, P.C. “ Ma,” said Wales, “ we’ve got all
those colonial delegates from Heaven knows where
to look at the show—isn’t that enough for you ? ”
“ No,” slid his ma, “if Plain Bill doesn’t turn
up, I don’t put on my crown.” And she didn’t.
Dear old “Hell Fire'Jack ” (Capt. John
M'Lean), a bold and fearless spirit, is dead at last.
He was chief-officer of the Champion, which
traded between England and Sydney, 45 years
ago, and in 1863 he was picked up in an open boat
after a week’s fearful suffering in the tropics conse-
quent on having had to abandon hissbip the Saxon,
which had taken Are. In 1851 he navigated the
steamer Victoria from England to Melbourne;
subsequently he commanded the Melbourne, Dun-
can Hoyle, and Citizen paddle-steamers, andlhes.s.
Ladybird. Thereafter he rose to be commodore of
M’Meckan Blackwood's fleet, ani for years was
in the Omeo. Then he went successively to the
Aldinga, the Alhambra, Albion, Otago, Tararua,
Gothenburg, Ringaroooma and Victorian. When
he died he was captain of the Ozone. On looking
down this long list one cannot help reflecting on
the terrible fates which overtook several of the
vessels named —the Tararua and Gothenburg
for instance—after old Jack had given up his
command to others. Capt. M‘Lean was a man
with a big heart, grand energy, and unsurpassed
decision of character. His nickname will never
keep him out of Heaven.

And would grieve!
Or cruel pomp oppress his mate
By his leave!
No, heaven he thanked and here you see
There’s the difference twixt him and me,
Come trusty friends surround me here

And drink with me St. Louis Beer,
Yes you may.

fJlHK GREAT QUESTION OF THE DAY.
The great question of the day with the public is
what are the banks going to do with the money
now in their vaults, amounting in coin and bullion
to no less a sum than sixteen seventy-
three thousand one hundred and ninety-two
pounds sterling (16.073,192).
The ingenuity of the different bank managers
and directors will now be taxed how to keep divi-
dends from going down.
Well, for the information of the public and the
safe guidance of all bank managers and directors
we will explain. But the information must be
kept strictly private, as it is of a confidential
nature. It is best imparted in its naked truth,
and as it came under our notice.
DRAMATIS PERSONAS.
All the Sydney Bank Managers
AND
All Bank Directors.
Scene : A bank in George-street, near the Post
Office.
Present: The aforesaid Dramatis Personae.
He Yclept “Tom” —the North Shore “King,” in
the chair.
Emperor William, of Pitt-street (a chiel weel kent),
in the vice chair.
The chairman, having called the meeting to
order, said, —“ Well, Gentlemen, the public are
anxious to know, doncherknow, what WE are go-
ing to do to ASSIST the country and the
COUNTRY'S TRADE with the sixteen millions
now in our vaults.
Of course you are all aware that the increase in
deposits for the year just passed amounted to no
less a sum than £7,016,380 sterling.
“ Yes, I repeat gentlemen, no less a sum than
£7,016,380.”
Chorus of Voices:
“And every POUND bearing INTEREST.”
The excitement was intense —chairs shitted, feet
shuffled, and heads sagely shook being the chief
manifestations.
But the tableau had yet to come, for a voice
broke in frjm the far end of the board-room say-
ing, I knew how it would be. I have repeated to
myself tirce after time that these contamination
circumferenced BUIDDING SOCIETIES and
thrice-doubly-blanked LAND BANKS would bring
trouble to OUR DOORS and REDUCED dividends
to our poor and unfortunate shareholders. And —
But at this juncture one of the “ princes,” whose
bank was known to have made rather heavy
advances to one of the aforesaid societies for the
express purpose of purchasing 500 acres of utterly
worthless mud-slush swamp, at once turned ill.
Instantly King “ Tom,” that truest of Falstarfs,
ordered a brandy and soda, which the sick one
drank, much to the annoyance and disgust of that
man o’ temperance and guid works —the Pitt street
Emperor W illiam himself, man.
The meeting was then adjourned until that day
week at 12 o’clock to enable the managers to go
and buy LAWiER’S
BLACK SILK HATS at 10s. 6d.
MASHER BOOTS at 12s. 6d.
WHITE SHIRTS at Is 9d.
SILK UMBRELLAS a’. 9a.
FROCK SUITS at 65s.
SOCKS and COLLARS and CUFFS.
With the view to their appearing in the same at
their next meeting, as it was more than probable
several of their Melbourne orethren would be
present, and it was necessary for them to look

NOT A LUNATIC.
Among the crowd of miseries wedged together
in the deck of a suburban police court on a recent
wet and cold morning, was a tall, middle-aged )
and somewhat military looking man presented on
the old familiar charge of “drums and disorderly.”
“ Anything to say 2” said the magistrate.
“ No, your Honour, only that I took a drop too
much on account of having the rheumatics so bad,
and I don’t seem to remember the rest.”
“ But the constable says you wanted to fight
him for who should have the best grave in the new
‘State House?’ ”
“Maybe I did your Honor, but the drink wasn’t
as good as they get it in the Parliamentary refresh-
ment rooms.”
“ Ten shillings, or forty-eight hours, and don’t
come here again.”
“ Could your Honor make it five shillings, and I
never will. I’ve only seven-and-six in the world,
and I want to buy a bottle of St. Jacobs oil to get
rid of the rheumatics.”
“Are you the man that writes ‘Eternity,’ and
‘ Repent,’ and those advertising texts about St.
Jacobs oil all over the city 2 ”
“No sir, lam not. I was a non-commissioned
officer in a Queen’s regiment once, and now I’m
not much of anything to speak of, but I m not a
lunatic if I do take a little drop more than is good
for me at odd times.”
CUT THIS OUT AND TAKE CARE OF IT
The invaluable Waterbury would not be the
cheapest watch in the world if it could not be re
paired at a low cost. But if anything goes wrong
with it the owner has only to take or send it to
the offices of the Waterbury Watch Company at
56, Margaret-street, where it can be repaire
at a cost according to its requirements, but in no
case exceeding 2s. 6d. unless by mutual consent.
The cost of transmission by post or parcel delivery
on watches sent from the country must be pre-
paid, and a sufficient amount to cover return
charges and cost of repairs forwarded at the same
time. If sent in the box in which the Waterbury
Is sold, the postage fee is 3d. each way.
j The principal hotelkeepers in the colonies have
1 voluntarily expressed their opinions on the subject
of Clausen’s New York Champagne Lager Beer,
! and all speak of it in the highest possible terms.
It has given the most perfect satisfaction every-
; where, as well to the trade as to ths public.
Clausen’s New York Champagne Lager Beer is
[ without a rival. It maintains its bright color and
I effervescence, and is free from sediment for an un-
limited length of time. It is the best beer ever
placed on the market.
Experience has taught most men who value
their health, that the safest reply to the oft-
repeated query “what’s yours?” is Clausen’s
New York Champagne Lager Beer. It is univer-
; sally recognised as a light, pure, invigorating
ii stimulant.
FOR THE INFORMATION OF LADIES
ONLY.
Dr. SCOTT’S ELECTRIC CORSET is a gentle
and pleasant support, encircling the waist with
neat and accurate, tit, and aiding by the vitalising
properties of e l ectricity the functions of the
nervous organisation. Worn by the ladies of the
principal Royal Families of Europe, by the elite
of American and Continental Society, they are
daily endorsed by tens of thousands, and as they
do not exceed in cost the ordinary goods of other
makeis, without the electricity or therapeutic
value of any kind, who will refuse to give them a
trial ?
The mind becomes active, the nerves and
sluggish circulation are stimulated, and all the old-
time health and good-feeling come back. They
are constructed on scientific principles, imparting
an exhilarating, health-giving current to the
whole system. Professional men assert that there
is hardly a disease which Electricity or Magnetism
may not benefit or cure, and they daily practise
the same, as your own physician will inform you.
The Corsets do not differ in appearance from
those usually worn, as we substitute our flat steel
magnitods in place of the ordinary corset steels.
They are all equally charged, differing only in
quality and design. They are elegant in shape
and finish, made after the best French pattern,
and warranted satisfactory in every respect
Those who have tried them say they will wear no
others.
The persistent use of these Corse cs will banish
the most distressing cases of Hysteria, Cutaneous
Disease, Nervousness. Back-ache, Indigestion,
Palpitation, &c.
They are sent out in a handsome box,
accompanied by a silver-plated compass, by which
the Electric-Magnetic influence can be tested. If
you cannot get them in your town, we will send
either kind to any port or railway station in New
South Wales or Queensland upon receipt of price
named, with Is. fid. added; or will mail direct to
any address upon receipt of stamps to cover full
postage.
In ordering, kindly state exact size of Corset
usually worn ; or where the size is not known,
take a measurement of the waist over the linen.
1 his can be done with a piece of common string,
which send with your order.

When the taxing of costs in the case of
Mayor Bell, of Geelong, v. Editor Hoare, of the
local Times, came on, the attorney for the de
fendant (who was successful at the trial) made a
claim for having read the works of Dickens,
Thackeray, and Mark Twain in getting up his
client’s case. The Taxing-master struck out the
item, but the attorney has appealed to the Court,
It’s the correct thing now to attribute all
good jokes to Gilbert. Dean Swift and Sydney
Smith are played out, and in Victoria even
Aspinall is never credited with a stale witticism
now.

’ARRY: “ WHAT A FUNNY WAY TO SPELL F-I-S-H!"
How ignorant a globe-trotter may be after
all, and how far away he may go to learn things
that are common enough at home ! James Hing-
ston, who is telling more about his travels to
Melbourne Argus, had to go to Mentone to find
out that in some R. C. churches the priest’s names
are labelled on the confessionals, and visitors are
requested “ not to spit in the church.” And yet,
writes a correspondent, who seems to be a good
R C., James could have unearthed these customs
even at Melbourne and Sydney before he started
for foreign parts.
The second daughter of the Prince of
Wales is engaged to be married to the Grand
Duke Miohaelovich of Russia.
The Rev. George Sutherland, a Presby-
terian clergyman, wants the Glebe (Sydney)
Council to stop boys from disturbing the holy
palm Of the Calvinistic Sawbatb by hawking
papers in that municipality. Which do you think
you’d rather hear on Sunday—the passing yawp
of the newsboy, or the eternal din of the parson s
cow-bell 2
Large parcels of Mount Morgan shares
have been sold in Rockhampton for £5 12s. to

Ashburton (N.Z.), like Sydney, has a
Benevolent Asylum. An old blind man used to
be among the inmates, but he ran amuck with a
hoe or something of the kind and was taken out
of the Asylum and put into gaol instead. He did
six months there, and when he was released some
kindly soul gave him 2s. which he straightway
invested in a cab-ride to the police court, and
asked for six months more. It was any amount
better than the other place, he said, and by dint
of “cheeking the beak” he succeeded in getting
run in for another half year.
