SATURDAY. OCTOBER 1. 1887.
The Great Woman Question.
The dependence of a woman upon her hus-
band is, after all, the chief incentive to mar-
liage. It insures harmony in the relations
existing between man and wife, and where
the woman is of an imperious chaiacter it
somewhat modifies the concretion of frenzied
threat in illicit practice. I nder existing
conditions there is no room for the recogni-
tion of any more competitors in the labour
markets of the world, and competition from
the feminine camp against the labour of men
is only not quite so bad as competition from
Chinese and Caffres, Instead of the leprous
yellow-skin or the rancid blackamoor, man’s
dearest foe would then be his mother or his
sister—not his wife, for when female labour
is actually let rush with all its flood-force
few men not born capitalists will be able to
afford the luxury of a wife. Therefore,
though it sounds anti-progressive, we con-
sider woman’s present sphere of usefulness
is of a domestic and maternal rather than of a
commercial or professional character. Of
course, there will always be some women in-
capacitated by education, temperament, cir-
cumstance or environment, from fulfilling
the truly sacred offices of wife and mother.
Of these we have nothing to say. The
question is to be considered in its broad
aspect. Woman’s enfranchisement just now-
means man’s enslavement. To throw open
every presentavenue of labour to woman is to
increase the number of competitors without
increasing the opportunities for their labour.
The organs or the individuals which pise as
the champions of woman in this matter are,
he it noted by the democracy, absolutely
silent in regard to a resumption of the
world’s landed ustate ; there is no bold pro-
posal to confiscate rents, to realise the
theories of Wallace or Henry George ;
no sincere appreciation of the fierce need of
a redistribution of the world’s wealth.
Break down the barriers ! Let loose this
surging crowd of modern Menads on the
stronghold of Labour, and Capital can
entrench itself belrnd the sophistries of
competition, and, beneath the sanctified
iegis of priest-bestowed and parson-blessed
authority, sit and smilingly watch the rend-
ing and wrestling, the awful contention and
frenzied scrambling which shall attend this
new distribution of poverty.
* * *
Therefore, the dependence of woman upon
the labours of man is not an altogether un-
desirable thing. The enfranchisement of
woman is an affair for the future. At pre-
sent it would only serve to complicate the
social problem which confronts us. Its con-
summation would delay instead of accelera-
ting the grand and ultimate reform. Half
measures represent the enemy’s retreating
lines. At each concession moss-grown Tory-
ism makes a fresh stand and shows fight
anew. The world’s history is eloquent with
examples which show that the measure of
reform has always been proportional with
the magnitude of the abuse. The countries
which accepted the alleged blessings of the
Reformation have been parson-ridden and
State-church-cursed years—aye, centuries —
after those more theologically afflicted nations
which permitted Rome to fill up and over-
brim the measure of its tyranny, and which,
now that they are freed of the incubus, are
freed for all time. Protestantism was but a
half-measure, and the tendency of all half-
measures is in turn to become a source of
danger to progress. The greater the despot-
ism, the more drastic the remedy. Russia’s
autocracy is tempered by nihilism ; Ger-
many's milder rule, by a less purging medi
cine—socialism ; the evil of bad Government
in France is punished by che aperient of
communism ; while England’s rule of molly-
coddle by the grace of God is spasmodically
ameliorated by a bourgeois brand oi Chartism
and alleged middle-class Liberalism. And
the latter nation will struggle longest
in the throes of thraldom. The half-
measure of liberty is a species of partial
political paralysis, and the proposal to
enfranchise women is a Tory endeavour to
bolster up a falling cause. Its only effect
would be to increase the demand for employ-
ment without enlarging the opportunities for
employment.
* * *
Of course, the Sydney D.T. appears as the
champion of the weaker sex. This paper,
with its democratic pretensions, is only the
organ of the bourgeoisie, the middle-class
Conservatives. In a recent article on the
“ Decay of Chivalry,” it seemed to glory in
the fact that the romance and the poetry
which had hitherto environed woman as
with a hallowed atmosphere had been blown
away by the rude breath of modern icono-
clasiic materialism, and that woman hence-
forth was free to act as man, to c urt the
world’s bufiVts and to reap the rewards of
fortune and the slights thereof, without let
or hindrance. Says this Solon of cheese-
and-bacon prosperity :
“ For ourselves we would put no limits to this
equalityof the sexes —“and would not check
the innovations of reform till they had succeeded
in placing women on an equal footing with men in
every respect affecting their place in the social
and political sjstem . . . That all this in-
volves great sacrifices to what was once called the
superior sex is clear. It involves sacrifices of
social relation and political and legal superiority,
and it involves very material sacrifices in the
business competition of daily life. Whatever
they are they must be made, and made as cheer-
fully as we may. Wo have long recognised that
no man has a right to be doing any work if there
was a man who, everything considered, was
capable of doing it better.”—* Better’ also implies
* morecheaply ’ to the class the Sydney D.T. repre-
sents, and the justice of this we deny. —' ‘ We must
now extend the proposition and say that he has no
right to it if it can be done by any woman. If the
male sex cannot face this competition and accept
the sacrifices it may impose, it must once for all
relinquish its claims to be considered the stronger
sex and must take a second place in the world.”
By the last sentence the D.T. plainly
welcomes with indecent glee the pros-
pect of surveying from its Sydney watch-
tower the fierce competition, the heartless
striving for the first place, between men and
women. Henceforth, farewell all pleasures
of domestic kind, adieu the home with all
its thousand associations praised and com-
memorated in song and history. For the
benefit of the soulless wretch who pays out
sordid dimes for grinding drudgery the spirit
of emulation must be encouraged between
the sexes—“ competition” must be “un-
fettered.” “Competition” is the sacred
shibboleth of the money bags. It enables
them to live in riot, luxury and laziness
without stirring a limb or soiling a hand.
The tradea’-umon is tin sworn foe to the
evils of unchecked competition. The D.T.
sometimes pretends to be a democratic paper
—the organ of the working-man—and it here
hoarsely dexands the abolitim of ad checks
to competition. Why does it not openly ad-
vocate the emp'oyment of Chinese lab mr ?
As well employ Chinese as goad on our
women to coil pate agaiust us. The cry of
democracy is not for a removal of the barrieis
that fence around competition. The liberal
rallyiog-shout of the luture will be, “ Re-
distribution of the world’s wealth, and a re-
moval of those barriers which prevent the
labourer receiving the just reward of his
labour ! ”
* ♦ ♦
To admit woman to every branch of
labour, to recognise her as politically and
socially the equal of man, is to put her in a
position to negative the work of her hus-
band, and to close the avenue of success to
her sons and her brothers. In the article
from which we have already quoted the D.T.
says :
“ Women in the future will possess equal powers,
equalrights, equal opportunities, with those owned
by men.”
That may be, but the powers, right?, and
opportunities now enjoyed by man will be,
by woman’s competition, depreciated 75 per
cent. You can employ three women, or four
women for that matter, for the same sum
which one man will consider an underpay-
ment for his services. In a recent number
of the Fortnightly Review, F. Mabel
Robinson, in a paper entitled “ English
Working Women and their Earnings,”
throws a lurid light on this aspect of female
competition. To a large class of workmen’s
wives a few shillings per week in addition to
their husbands’ earnings make all the differ-
ence between penary and comfort. And
these housewives, unconscious of the misery
their competition inflicts upon those who are
slaving for the barest of bare livings, take
work at starvation prices. These women
are the profit-makers for the cheap exporter
and shoddy-goods compiler. Soldiers’ slop
great-coats are built for 10d. each, and
white canvas jackets, very stiff and hard to
sew, for Is. Export trousers cost 4|d. per
pair, and fur-lined cloaks are sewn together
for Is. ; while Is. Id. per dozen has been
paid by a West End shop for machine-made
Oxford-shirts; lid. each, buttonholes in-
cluded, is at present a regulation wage. In
a lady’s night-dress there are from three to
five days’ work, yet 6s. is a high price to pay
for the making. The highest earnings of a
skilled “ white ” worker when employed by
a high-class firm on such garments, average
2s. per day. Cheaper houses pay only 3s. Gd.
to 3s. 9i. each for these robes, which take,
however, the same time to make. The
writer states that in many trades in England
a woman must underbid the men to obtain
employment, and by so doing she becomes
the enemy of the male worker, who,
wherever and whenever he can, justly
refuses to work with those who depre-
ciate the value of his labour. Imagine what
the state of things would be were all women
put upon a footing of absolute equality with
men in regard to the obtaining of employ-
ment ! What a Paradise of plenty to the
employer, the capitalistic parasite, would
then be furnished ! The married woman,
whose labours eked out her husband’s pit-
tance, would underbid the single woman
dependent on her own labour only ; or
if a single woman found that marriage
would incapacitate her for the labour
market, she would be careful not to
contract any Open alliance, or, if married,
she would suppress by artificial means the
natural functions of maternity, and a condi-
tion of universal free-love—at least, among
the working-classes—would ensue, with out-
ward respect for existing social institutions,
and clandestine, and immoral because
clandestine, indulgence, induced by needs of
a thoroughly physiological and natural de-
scription. Whatever tends to discourage or
discredit marriage undue facility of divorce,
the increased difficulty of the procuration of
the material comforts of life, the ferocity of
competition, the application of women to
the harder forms of labour—as society is at
present constituted, has an immoral and
therefore a disintegrating influence. The
competition of women against man, before
the granting of more urgent social reforms,
would hasten the advent of complete
anarchy.
* * #
The safety of society as it is at present
constituted—and society as it is at present
constituted we attempt in no way to defend
rests, to an almost incalculable degree,
upon the dependence of woman on her
husband—upon the necessity to woman of
the existence of man. Women are far from
that stage of progressive rationalism when
they can take their stand on the same plat-
form with men. The equality argument is
an absurd one. Mind, after all, in a broad
sense, depends upon matter. The great
work of the world, and we are prepared to
admit many exceptions to the rale, is per-
formed by the healthful, physically strong
men of the world. Woman is man’s inferior
physically. In some few instances which do
not effect the main issue, some women may
have outshone some men. This proves
nothing. Women, as a totality, are far inferior
to men, as a totality. Helen Taylors are
not types of great classes, and though the
advocates of female enfranchisement ad-
vance as a reason for the differences between
the sexes that the conditions for female cul-
ture have been until of late years of a decidedly
antagonistic character, still the very fact that
women are incapable of great iutfilectual
development, unless the complete surround-
ing environment; is altogether favourable, is
a prima facie proof of at least present in-
feriority. We do not deny that woman has
the power to work out her mental salvation.
We simply say that she has not yet
achieved it. Now, at all events, she
lacks that essential vigour which is in man
the guarantee of success. Where woman
poisesses this particularly masculine charac-
teristic she is wanting in those distinctive
traits which we invariably associate with ail
wo consider feminine. The roll of fame
contains tho names of many men who have
had absolutely to cut their way to success,
when circumstances have been of not even a
neutral but of a determinedly adverse des-
cription But where the feminine mind has
hid foil scope amid a genial environment
has it frondesced in a feminine Homer, a
Shakespeare, a Milton, a Newton, or a
Bacon? From the past experience of
humanity it would appear that there are
highways and byeways of intellectual de-
velopment which will be sealed to woman,
even to the remotest crack of doom, and
those women who but superficially penetrate
them seem so distinctively masculine that
their sex appears but one of Nature’s errors.
* * *
Woman’s enfranchisement is a Tory pro-
pisal. The Imperial Parkes and the
Sydney Imperial onm-Freetrade D.T., which,
by its recent utterances in re the case of
Miss Holden, shows that abnormally strong
feminine influence is not unknown as a fac-
tor in its production, is its mouthpiece and
advocate. It will be remembered that most
of the gentlemen who so gallantly exerted
themselves but recently to establish a Ladies’
College in connection with the Sydney
University were also of that class known as
blue-blooded Conservatives—though we
should like it understood that we are not
amongst those who proclaim woman has no
need of education. Far from it. Woman
suffrage is a pet stock movement with the
Conservatives. Amongst its supporters may
be read such high-sounding names as
Bussell Gurney, Lord Bbaconsiteld—
the cynic apostate from a faith which
denies woman a soul Lord Iddes-
leigh, Mr. Forsyth (M.P, for Maryle-
bone, and a number of others of that
ilk. And Tories champion the alleged cause
of woman because the women of to-day are,
as a rule, Tories ; almost every woman is a
queen-worshipper, a prince-worshipper, a
parson-worshipper, a lord-worshipper. Every
play-wright recognises the ruling feminine
instinct; Maritana is bought with a neck-
lace and a kingly (not a manly) smile. A
flare of gaslight, a gilded bauble, a blaze of
trumpets, a gaiiy-caparisoned horse—and a
woman has sold her soul and bartered the
birthright of a nation. Such things, as we
who went to the Soudan know, are potent
ei on with man—but with woman ! Alas 1
Woman’s habitual line of sight is toward the
past, the vanishing point in her perspective,
a coronet. The Tories recognise that their
position would be but more embastioned
rather than in any way weakened by throwing
open the p olit ical arena to the w omen of to-day .
The parson is the lieutenant of the Tory politi-
cian. Woman suffrage would mean so many
more votes in the pockets of the parson. The
powers that be are ever making bids for
popularity with the wieldera of the distaff.
In New South Wales the death penalty by
hanging is practically abolished asfaras woman
is concerned. Murder by the fair hand of one’s
wife is not visited with capital punish-
ment in that colony as it is in the case
of a man who may murder a woman. The
case of the Maitland poisoners is a precedent.
It was a cruel remorseless murder for the sake
of gain. There was not connected with it one
single palliating circumstance—not one. The
’ Sydney Echo said that modern civilisation
revolted at the execution of a woman. So
Mrs. Keep and Mrs, Millar escaped the
gallows. In Victoria the sentence of death
passed upon Mrs. Mephan for the muroerof
her sister—cold-blooded, and instigated by
merely mercenary motives—has just been
commuted to penal servitude for life.
Hence for all practical purposes capital
punishment as far as women are concerned,
has been abolished in Victoria and New
South Wales. In the latter colony four
boys were hanged only the other day for an
alleged crime, intrinsically less than murder ;
for in England, from which we profess to
obtain our wondrous examples of legislative
wisdom, rape is not a capital offence, while
murder is. The Tories are anxious to ex-
tend the franchise to woman, to put her on
a footing equal in every respect to man, yet
they hang seventeen year-old boys for alleged
rape, while they pardon women forthe commis-
sion of calculating, cruel and Wainewright-
ish murders. Truly the future aspect of the
woman question is not a reassuring one. Let
her engage with Toryism to stifle reform and
there is nothing she may not ask, there is no
offence she may not commit with impunity—
all will be condoned in haste by men who
will ultimately give her a Divorce Bill four
hundredfold more generous than Sir Allred
Stephen’s.
A Horse-Racing Question.
That little contretemps in connection with the
Epsom Handicap at last Rand wick race-
meeting serves to draw attention to one or two
considerations touching horse racing, in the point
of view of the public advantage. Mr. James
White is a popular and honorable horse-owner ;
yet a decidedly adverse demonstration was raised
against him over the winning of the race named
oy his horse Lava. Both Mr. White and his
jockey, Hales, were hissed and hooted as though
they had been guilty of a breach of some rule of
conduct laid down for the guidance of persons in
their position, and having a protective effect as
regards the wagering public. That the
nostile display was unjustified was speedily
shown, but the fact that it was made
points to the existence of a fault some
where in the administration of A.J.C. affaire.
Formerly, the owner of more than one horse in a
race was permitted and expected to declare with
which animal he proposed to win. If Mr. White
had been allowed to “declare” in respect of the
Epsom Handicap, undoubtedly he would have
announced his intention of winning, if possible,
with Lava, and his other horse, Perfume, would
practically have been out of the betting. In the
forced absence of an open declaration, however,
the public had to fall back upon circumstantial
evidence as to which of Mr. White’s cattle was
intended to pull off the race. It was well-known
that Hales always carried White's winning
colours, and accordingly the public watched
eagerly for the notification as to which
was to be Hales’ mount. In due course
the semaphore announced that the jockey
id question was to ride Perfume, and
straightway the public backed that horse with
such persistency that the odds of two to one on
had soon to be given. But the semaphore
nounoement was erroneous. The official charged
with the duty of publishing the list of starters
with their respective riders made the unfortunate
and extraordinary mistake of connecting Hales’
name with a horse he was never intended to rids.
The horse he did ride won the race, and conse-
quently the backers of Perfume lost heavily, and
waxed indignant at what appeared to them a
planned deception,
* • #
Whether the deception was a “ put-up
thing,” or, as would seem to be the case,
the result of mere negligence, Mr. White
clearly was free from culpability, and the
hooting bestowed on him by the public was
therefore unfair. Yet it is only by such exhibi-
tions of disapprobation that an assemblage of
psople can express their belief that a fault exists,
and that a remady is required. The hooting was
not, as we take it, levelled at Mr. White per-
sonally—for he is a sportsman in whom the public
repose the greatest confidence —but at the circum-
stance of the false announcement, which induced
the backing public to put their money on a horse
never intended to land the prize. In the excite-
ment attending the conclusion of a race, the
crowd naturally forget nice points of abstract jus-
tice, and jump with alacrity to the conclusion
that a mistake involving the transference of their
moneys to the bookmaking fraternity can hardly
be the outcome of unadulterated innocence. Pus
sibly the inference drawn last week was not alto-
gether without warrant. The people, anyhow
seemed to feel that they had a real grievance
originating in misconduct somewhere. Even on
the last day of the meeting the defeat of one of


White's horses was received with an outbreak of
applause, though in this case the public were
largely interested in his winning.
* * *
Evidently the mischief lies in disallowance of
declarations. A club rule insists upon every horse
going for the money, and denies to a a owner o f
more than one the power to say at the oucset
with which he will endeavour to win. The rule
s absurd, since it pre-supposes that a possible
winner can never suffer defeat without being
obviously pulled, or being otherwise ridden in a
way to show plainly that he was intended not to
win—a postulate capable of being knocked sky-
high by the veriest tyro in horse-racing. There
are horses, doubtless, that cannot be made to lo?e
without visible efforts on the part of their riders ;
but such animals are so rare that they need
hardly be taken into account. The average horse
requires to bo ridden with care, and with a desire
to have him first at the finish, to enable him to de-
feat even an inferior field. A jockey who is a
clever winning rider is also, as a rule, a clever
losing rider. It follows, therefore, that the idea
of compelling every horse to go straight for victory
is pure nonsense. If an owner has two or
more horser in a race he settles beforehand
with which he intends to land the money if he
can do it at all. J hen why should he not be
allowed to declare his intention ? That his dis-
ability to do this may be made the means for the
I agrag and bobtail to illicitly make money out of
the public, the incident last week seems to prove
The public look for a declaration, and simply per-
ceive a false signal—put up, perhaps, purely by
mistake, but which might ea-ily be put up of
malice aforethought. A return to the old method
wonld certainly be preferable.
PLAIN ENGLISH
The Unholy Alliance.
The latest tactics of the Parkes Government are
worth a lot of watching. Conscious of the fact
that Freetrade in New South Wales is on its last
legs, the Calico Jimmy contingent have searched
for and found an appropriate ally in the pastoral
land grabbing parly. The monopolists of com-
merce arc unitii g with the land monopolists of
the West. The attitude of the Government can-
not be mistaken. The Honorable Thomas Gar-
rett, in the lavishness of his generosity to the
pastoralists, has sufficiently shown his unwilling-
ness to let anything estrange the sympathies
of the squatters from his party. His gift of
promises to them is strongly reminiscent of
the conduct of an historic personage generally
known as the Unjust Steward. “How much
owest thou to my Lord,” asked the latter gentle-
man, “an hundred measures of oil? Take thy
bill and sit down quickly and write foursome.”
Similarly the Honourable One interrogates the
land grabbers. “ How much do you owe my
master, the public I Fourpence an acre and im-
provements. Give me thy lease and J will add a
clause giving compensaticn for improvements. 1 '
This union of parties is the onljr thing that can
prop up that hoary lie ‘ 1 Freetrade ’ for another
session. The people will not support that thrice-
condemned policy, as the Freetraders and squat-
ters must unite against the people. There is
nothing new In the unholy alliance. New
South Wales from time immemorial has been
run in the interests of the importers and the
land sharks, The present alliance is only new in
the circumstance that both parties hope to “rook”
a long suffering public to an enormously greater
extent than they have ever done before. Thai’s
all. And it is quite possible that the conspiracy
may, for a time at least, meet with very much
success. The false issue upon which last election
was decided — Parkes versus Dibbs, for that really
was the only important question of February has
resulted in the endowment of a herd of crawlers
and trucklers with the legislative function. Men
who were in the only possible vile sense o/ihe
people,” but most emphatically not “for the
people,” uttered the shibboleth of party and thus
gained seats. They were elected because they
crawled to Parkes, and they will yet teach elec-
tors a bitter lesson by continuing to crawl after
him wherever he may lead. This is one of the
most conspicuous and necessary incidents of
Government by Parkes, Garrett, Salomons,
and their covetous, cowering “Co.”
The Burden of Railway Losses.
As might have been expected the Parkes pro-
gramme for the ensuing session of tho New
South Wales Parliament gives railway exten-
sion a very prominent position. There is a hazy
indeflniteness, too, as to the destinations of these
projected railways which will be eminently ser-
viceable to the Government. We know of nothing
more likely to fix right principles of Government
more firmly in a member’s mind than the prospect
of getting a railway vote for the district which he
represents. Hold out to a man a hope of railway
stations opposite the bouses of his best supporteis
ano he will believe with an unfaltering faitn in
the alleged eternal superiority of any political
'doctrines which the dominant faction may from
time to time favour and support. Parkesian
genius has ever been quick to recognise
this attribute of political human nature.
Therefore the Ministerial programme is such
■as to give at least half of the members an
enduring hope that a railway in their several
electorates will reward their Freetrade devotion
during the session. Hut before the country con-
sents to any more railway jobs being perpetrated
it would be as well to see how far its lines have
'been financially successful in the past. At the
end of 1886 the capital invested in railways to-
talled £24 000 000 ; the return of net earnings was
only £667,000 equal to less than,3 percent, on the
'capital. That is to say, the railways in 1886 cost
'the country a little over £300,000. Nor are
Matters in this respect likely to improv , if we
maj judge from the records of statistics. T tie net
earnings were less than they have been in any
year since 1880. when the capital invested was
only *12,000,000, and the interest cn capital
Represented by net earnings was less than
it has been in any year since 1871. The
Percentage of working expenses to gross earn-
ings in 1886 was 6!) per cent.—higher than
in any year since 1864, aid the working ex-
penses per train greater than at any time since the
year last named. These are solid facts which
Parkes in his recent oraTon on railways entirely
omitted to notice. And the loss is certain to in-
‘crease mightily as soon as lines now in course of
completion ara opened for traffic. For none of
the branch lines cover their cost.; main trank
lines alone are worked at a profit. There can be
no possible justification for these profitless exten-
sions while the accepted policy of the country is
Freetrade ; for unless home trade is encouraged
it will never, in this land of high wages, be able to
sustain railways in the interior. Freetrade stimu-
lates ocean traffic, but it is death on the home
trade. It makes decentralisation an utter im-
possibility by giving the importers a monopoly of
business. A madder cry than “ Freetrade and De-
centralisation ” was never uttered by any lunatic
out of Taiban Creek. If you insist upon the bas-
tard policy caded Freetrade you can’t have de-
centralisation, and if you don’t decentralise you
can’t make inland railways pay their annual cost.
But as Parkesian Freetrade cannot be sustained
without the help of railway extension it is certain
that tht- continuance of the present faction in
office will lay a still heavier burden of railway
loss on the backs of unfortunate taxpayers.
£300,0t0 they had to pay on this account last year.
This year the burden will go very close to half-a-
million. Parkes as a national institution is a
heap more costly than wharf-resumptions and
Soudan expeditions. The blunder of the Febru-
ary elections will be certified by increasing railway
loss until Protection is permitted to stimulate the
home trade and bring in Decentralisation of pro-
duction of enterprise and of profit.
♦
The boundless realm of the unflxable is filled
with things that are past finding out, and the
Church of England is among the most unaccount-
able of them all. At his ordination the modern
prelate, like his remote predecessor, takes an oath
not to be “ covetous, nor greedy of filthy lucre,”
also “ to be faithful in ordaining,” &c., but times
are changed sines the ancient Roman policeman—
the cne who was roasted alive in Pompeii—used
to give the ancient unshod bishop two hours to
shin out of Judah with his baggage tied up in a
red pocket handkerchief, and the bishop has
changed with them. In those old days
the stranger who married a bishop’s daughter
always supposing the prelate could re-
main long enough in one place ever to have
a daughter—had hunks of hard mud thrown at
him by the populace, hut when an obscure vessel
named Percy married the daughter of the late
Archbishop Sutton his experience was different:
he was made Vicar of eight different places
wi!h an aggregate screw of £lO,OOO per annum,
and as he couldn’t preach in eight churches at
once the work was done for him by curates with
salaries ranging from 15s. to £2 a week. He was
afterwards made a Bishop, and in defiance of law
he held in addition to his bishopric outside billets
worth about £lOOO a year Seven of Arch-
bishop Sutton's sons entered the Anglican
church, and he gave them right off sixteen of the
best-salaried billets at his command and about a
dozen more afterwards, and to the rest of his
sons-in-law he gave about five parishes apiece.
The recent Bishop Tomline had three sons who
held fifteen churches, and, consequently, fifteen
salaries among them, which might be described
as a tardy effort by the goddess of justice to
square the case of the shoeless Bishop who had
to shin out of Judah. The recent Sparks, Bishop
of Ely, distributed billets to the value- of
£3-9,912 per annum among his children,
whereby the Scripture was fulfilled where it
spates that man is born to trouble as the Sparkbs
fly upward. In fact a good many curates with
salaries of 14s. per week and permission to keep a
pig were born to trouble in order that the Sfarkes
might ris©, as that family swallowed enough to
keep 400 of them at twice the average curate’s
salary. At the present time in England £9,000,000
per annum is appropriated by 26 bishops and some
4700 absentee parsons who never preach and
hardly ever come within gunshot of their
parishes. Some of these apostles enjoy existence
amid the balmy breezes of Italy; some are col-
lectors of curiosities, or naturalists who spend
their time in hunting after butterflies; some
are individuals who look very elegant in nice
bathing costumes, and the rest are tennis-
players or yum-yummy individuals who shine
in mildly fashionable circles and make
themselves agreeable to the ladies. Many of them
draw five, six, or even eleven different salaries,
and their pastoral work is done by curates who
dine off cold cabbage, and try to make the same
seedy black coat endure five years. The Church
of England is a great institution —for the bishops
and their sons—but it is a darned bad shot at
sinners. Now and then it goes out to bunt for
one, but when it fires it generally blows the head
off its own spiritual dog, and so far as records go
it hasn’t converted any thing—except other peoples’
money to its own private uses—for the last 10
years.
There are very few moves on the mundane
board tnat the sky-pilot isn’t up to. The whilom
lecturer, C. E. Jones, has stated in the Victorian
Assembly that a Christian weekly printed at Mel-
bourne was sent to be posted in New South Wales
(where no postage is charged on newspapers) so that
it might be delivered free in Australia Felix and
elsewhere. The idea (though not exactly original)
is a good one, as it enables the godly to safely
cozen several colonies for the benefit of the holy
proprietor and the pious subscriber. The half-
penny swindle is only a small one —but little fish
are proyerbially sweet.
We have made up our mind regarding a quantity
of grease in a tin, which has been left at The
Bhxle'TlN office, accompanied by a handbill, say-
irg, “ fry Butterine on Toast.” We have tried
it on toast, and we emphatically declare that we
are not going to try it on toast any more. The
request to “ Try Butterine on Toast” fills us with
suspicion, for we remember that in the gloomy
days when we lived at a hash-foundry the advent
of hot buttered toast generally signified that Mrs,
Tomkin’scowgreasa being belowparwas oniyswal-
lowable when partially disinfected with charcoal.
We do not for a moment say that butterine needs
disinfection —on the contrary, it is sweet enough
to the palate and is no doubt made of sufficiently
honest materials ; we only wish to point but that
the legend above quoted is an unfortunate one.
considering the experiences of the man who writes
this. Never again shall our little plate, if we
know it, be used as a receptacle for manufactured
grease. W« regret to hear that a butterine factory
has been started near Sydney, it having been
found that 311,000 square miles of Freetrade
country can’t keep a million people in decent
butter. The butterine submitted to us is un-
objectionable as regards appearance, taste, and
smell, and as more than half the people in the
land seem unable to distinguish napntha from
whisky, we have no doubt they will like but-
lerine just as well as the butter tnat tastes of
clover—and a good deal better for the matter
of that, inasmuch as butterine is ever so much
the cheaper article. Tae people who make butterine
are no doubt honest enough, but as their grease is
a sufficiently close prima facie imitation of the
genuine article to be often saleable as real butter,
its introduction is in our opinion calculated to
lead to the rankest description of fraud and im-
posture on the part of retailers. In view of the
present depressed condition of the New South
Wah-s farming indusiry we are of opinion that
the making or selling of buterine should, in the
public interest, be made a penal offence punish-
ab'H by flogging. We presume, however, that
Pulsford, the Freetrade prophet, will for many a
year be able to point with pride > o the gigantic
premises of the Sydney butterine fakirs. Any-
thing-is good enough for the boarders.
Mr. Hamlet, the N.S.W. Government analyst,
having examined ten tam pies of colonial ale from
as many different brewers, says that the liquor in
question while otherwise pure is almost es heavily
loaded with that most terribly destructive poison
fasel-oil as are the cheap spirits sold in the public-
houses of Sydney. This startling state of mat-
ters is attributed to the comparative highness of
the temperatures at which colonial beer is
brewed Mr, Hamlet's opinion, which may pos-
sibly be contested by the brewers, seems to go in
vindication of the opinions so long held and so
emphatically expressed by Dr. Youl, the Mel-
bourne City Coroner, as to the deleteriousness of
the cheap and thirst-provokirg beverage affec-
tionately known to the Australian populace as
“Shiook” and “ Tanglefoot.” Dr. Youl avers
that the organs of those who die after a course of
colonial beer can at once be distinguished from
the organs of those who have been accustomed to
alcoholic stimulation through other mediums. The
writer has attended more than one post-mortem
at which the doctor, pointing his finger at the
liver and kidneys of the deceased has proudly re-
marked : “See, gentlemen, same old story.
Colonial stagger-juice.”
In many households conducted on alleged Ker-
ristian principles they eat hot mutton all the
week and cold mutton on Sunday, they play milk-
and-water melodies of no particular meaning on
the Waterbury time-payment piano on the days
set apart for profane labour, but when the reful-
gent sun of a sacred Sawbath glints through the
hallowed interstices of the consecrated Venetians
anthems of holiness ascend from the stomach of
the Yankee-imported cabinet organ and the dog
outside growls the responses in a minor key.
These religiously prudish folk live two lives with
moderate success, and they give the cue to the
Sydney newspaper proprietaries, who copy the
example as well as they know how. The sedate-
ness and chrism-anointed somnolence of the
S. M.H. is somewhat discounted by the low comedy
of that dra wing-room farceur, the Echo, whose
lemonadey wit exhausts itself in rehashing
the stale plunder of American back-block
journals, and whose jokes never get above
the intellectual appreciation of a curate.
The moral tone of the Sydney DT. is
assuaged and hot-poulticed by the giddy buco-
licism of its weakly echo, the Tribune, which
ministers to the agricultural n.ind a mixture of
watered humour, palsied puns, quasi-protection
to the farmer, and vague notes by a rustic lunatic
on the subject of hatching turnips, or grafting
cows in the early Spring. The S.M, H. is the
clerical father of stern and solemn aspect, the
Echo his prim son, who occasioaally gets on the
spree and indulges in too much ginger-pop. The
D.T, is the snortingly moral Freetrade uncle, and
the Tribune the lamely funny?hay-and-corn-
Protectionist nephew. The other day the D.T.
“ went for ” the private bar in a bald style and no
quarter, and the weekly paper owned by the same
proprietary—in the same week—carried joy to the
bosom of the farmer’s virtuous wife by represent-
ing a festive young thing in tights serving drinks
in a private bar —“ Ugh ! No wonder Joi,in goes
so often to Sydney 1”

The Queen has it in her regal eye to institute an
Order of Literary Merit. Past experience enables
us to give a pretty shrewd guess at the men who will
be made happy with the first batch of decorations.
Poor old Tennyson is safe for a Knight Comman-
dership of the noble Order, in consideration of his
Birthday Odes and Imperial driveliings. Sir
Algernon Borthwick, of the Morning Post,
will have the “literary merit” of his sassiety
pars, graciously recognised. The Cqjjbt Circular
editor can reckon upon being enrolled in the
slushy brotherhood. Historian Fboude, the
whitewasher of Henry YIII, is likely to write
O.L.M. after his name before he dies. Probably
Mr. William Black, who generally lays the
scene of his novels in Scotland, will not be for-
gotten. But nobody expects the ‘ ‘ distinction ’to
be conferred upon men who have committed one
honest, democratic thought to paper. There was
no talk of an .Order of Literary Merit while Car-
lyle, Thackeray, and Dickens were lashing
humbug and raisin g their great voices in the cause
of Democracy. While they were at the top of the
tree, Our Gracious Queen didn’t see her way clear
to express her royal regard for literature. Now
is a convenient time to let England understand
what class of writing its Sovereign really dotes
upon. Buskin’s unfortunate mental affliction
provides an excuse for overlooking him and in-
augurating an Order which shall be confined to
the slobbering C.M.G.s of literature.
The Mystery of Laura Swain— how she came to
be in the Yarra, and why she wasn’t pulled out
again—has not been elucidated by a protracted
coronial enquiry. As to the first point no evidence
was forthcoming save that of Captain Moore,
which was so meagre and “ unsensational ” that
the local press persistently discredited it in the
interests of trade. As to the second point—why
Laura was permitted to drown—there were two
witnesses, Captain Moore and a man named
Flynn, each interested in throwing blame upon
the other. But while the newspapers passed
lightly over Flynn's various excuses for not
saving the heroine from a watery grave, they
again discredited the Captain's prosaic explana- 1
lion. He said he was injured in jumping or
tumbling down the steep embankment, and fell
repeatedly as he ran along the river side. Backed
up as this story was by a doctor’s certificate, he
certainly showed some sort of cause for hot saving
his girl. Yet the admitted fact that Moore
lagged behind Flynn in the chase after poor Miss
Swain was commented upon to the former’s disad-
vantage, instead of the ocher way round. Now
that excitement has cooled down the public have
began to perceive that Captain Moore —unheroio
as he proved himself -has been considerably sacri-
ficed to sensational journalism. He was the natural
target at which to launch shafts of suspicion from
the editorial bow. To put his story in a fair light
had emailed a falling-off in the demand for
“further developments” and “more strange
revelations.” But, apart from having to bear the
brunt of one-sided newspaper comment, Captain
Moore was virtually prosecuted for murder by
the legal representative of the Crown. The
Crown took its instructions from “ our special re-
porters ” right away through. The police, who
are not generally backward in working up a case
against the first man that comes handy, made no
more hostile to Moor);. They had nothing to
gain, but something to lose, by suppressing this
and en ouraging that. CapUin Moore h»s to
thank the poJice for a negative support against
positive attack from other quarters. All things
considered, he got well through the coroner’s en
quiry before a j ury who felt they were expected
to find somebooy guilty of something. They
called him a coward, solely on the smfty evidence
of one other man, also “named” in the verdict.
But it is only fair to mention that Captain
Moore’s employers, and most interested critics,
believe him to be good enougu to take command
of his o.d ship once again. There now 1
The South Australian Press declares itself sick
even unto death of the great Parkks. South
Australia, it paints out, has enjoy ea 50 years of
Freetrade, and as the result it found itself the
only colony on this continent where population was
actually diminishing ; one-half of Ade<aide was
ticketed “to let, ’ and the other halt was for
sale; grass was commencing to grow in the
streets, and the lime seemed within measurable
distance when the site of the godly city would bo
sown with salt. Consequently, South Australia
has gone at last for Protection, and when Parkes
honoured Adelaide with a visit he was banqueted
by a Protectionist Ministry and by the Governor
of a Protectionist colony. This afforded the white-
headed bore of New South Wales such a chance
of exhibiting his ignorance and bad taste as he
seldom gets, and having relished his inner Hi-
Ham he rose to tho level of the occasion. For 60
weary minutes he drifted along in a gently flow-
ing tide of boastful drivel ; he related his early
history from the days when he was a baby politi-
cian brought up on the bottle right up to the mo-
ment when he came to inflict his calmly offensive
egotism on an Adelaide audience, and when he
had exhausted this subject he went on to tell his
audience of Protectionists in a colony that had
been ruined on strict Freetrade principles, what a
miserable, idiotic, blind, deaf, and dumb policy
Protection was, and to dilate on the utter im-
becility and watery-headedness of its advocates.
To quote the S.A. Advertiser
“ Sir Henry Parkes' address was long, it was tedious, io
was personal, it was egotistic. It contained a full catalogue
of his own merits. Some men are born to greatness, while
others have it thrust upon them, but we have Sir Henry's
assurance that his greatness is due to his own efforts He
admits that he is nor, a bjrn politician. He says that he has
studied politics, and it is this which has enabled Him to see
so far ahead of oth- r men. He recognises Freetrade as one
of the eternal verities of nature, and he would doubtles- add
it to the Athanasian creed, ‘ which, except a man believe
faithfully, he cannot be saved.’ His egotism has developed
to such an extraordinary degree that New South Wales has
ceased to furnish suitable society when his mind is in its
highest moods He is a lonely man, and only SHAKESPEARE
and Milton, and others of the immortal dead, aie tit com-
pany for Sir Henry Pabkes.”
*
The New South Wales Parliament having met,
each Freetrade Minister has put ori his undershict
of brass and is preparing for the fray ; and the
voice of Abigail is heard in the spring-time of
joy. This is what the voice has to say
“ ,fn January last tho Ministry went hack pledged to re-
turn as nearly as possible to a Freetrade policy. They were
bound to do this, because the country had spoken, If by
and bye the country spoke the other way he would not op
pose it in a factious spirit.’
No, Habiglk, you wouldn’t. When deep points re-
quire to be deducted on the dark subject of poli-
tical economy in order to prove that the country
is right in going for Protection, and that the
charitable grinder of Brickfield Hifi is light in go-
ing along with the country and keeping bis billet, and
that Bibbs is right and Parkes is right, and all is
as right as right can be, Frawncib won’t oppose
in a factious spirit. Not much. He will simply
retire to his office and fix up a “ minit" some-
thing like this ;
“ This is a Proteckshunist kuntry, and pot the bustefi
Freetrade place it used to was. There oughter he a dopty on
heyery think. I ear as ow heggs isn’t taxed, but they will
be soon. If Mr, M’Mdlan calls Ira hunt. (Signed) F.
Ann'; ail. Pea Es —The sekretary will proceed to make a
clean koppey of this dokyment.’ 1
If the above, or something to the same effect, does
not see the light within the next three years we
will eat Habibie’s stock of grindery and chase
his assistant down the street with a pair of tongs.
The other day a splay-mouthed ruffian was
brought before the Richmond (Vic.) Police Court,
charged with ill -treating a horse. It fed down in
the street and as it did not rite—simply because
it couldn't—for all bis kicks and curses, he put a
chain round its neck and harnessed this toanother
horse, intending to drag the poor animal along in
this way. If he had not beea slopped m lime he
would, probably, have pulled its head off. Yet
such a Caliban as this is allowed to vote and have
a hand in making laws! It is high time the
Franchise was extended to horses. Most horses
could vote more intelligently than such men as
this. Indeed we see no reason why horses should
not be returned to Parliament and made Justices
of the Peace. They will never obtain their rights
until they are. Letting this aside, however, as in
advance of the age, we think it is a criminal dis-
grace to what calls itself a civilised community
that dumb animals that haul and drag and wear
their lives out in working for us should be treated
in the shameful manner in which they too often
are. The only consolation we have when we see
brutality of this sort is that the men who are

And ye shall swell to an army vast,
And free from the wrongs of the North and Past

That notorious “ Cass case ” has been the means
of bringing to light other damaging stories about
Mr. Newton, the London magistrate. It appears
that a poor boy, accused of stealing, was sentenced
by Mr. Newton to three months’. The evidence
was so doubtful that a disinterested solicitor men-
tioned the case to a Mr. Burr as a scandalous in-
stance of injustice This Mr. Burr planked down
£5 and instructed the solicitor to appeal, promis-
ing to pay all incidental costs. When the appeal
was put in, Mr. New Ton reconsidered his verdict
and decided to discharge the boy. Here is an
example of how the mighty engine of the law can
he affected by £5 sterling. Penniless, the hoy
must have gone to gaol for three months. With
a “fiver” at his back he was enabled to leave
the C ourt without a stain, &c. What happens in
England happens in Austin'ia. Charitably dis-
posed persons might well form a fund for appeal-
ing against some of the decisions of some of our
beaks. It was by an appeal that Bob Sutton
escaped the dungeon cell for smiting Lord Beer-
hurst’s nose. Think of that!

The reply of the erudite Wise to the O'Sulli-
van's query concerning the new and tyrani-
cal “ rules for the exclusion of barristers” may be
correctly described as “clever.” He managed to
impress his auditors with the idea that he had
done nothing but promulgate the rules aforesaid,
omitting to state that his consent, as evidenced
by his signature, was a necessary condition pre-
cedent to their authority. Fence the questions
adroitly as he may, Mr, Wise cannot deny that if
he had chosen to oppose the rules they could
never have passed. Either he supported their
introduction or else he failed to protestagainst and
oppose them. In view of this fact, his evasive
explanation signally fails to accord with his
Ministerial title. He may be “ the honorable
B.R W.but he was not working at it much
when he endeavoured to —or at least succeeded in
—misleading the public in this disgraceful matter.
English gentlemen always are supposed to be able
to teach the uncultured colonials how honourably
office may be held—cunniog, police court-lawyer
tricks are never practised by cultured gentlemen.
Never ? Well, hardly ever.
The actual producing power of the average
British noble is about equal to that of a one-
legged deaf and dumb man without arms. Poor
Lord Drummond was an impecunious scion of a
titled race who offended his friends by marrying a
“ nobody,” and found himself barred from Govern-
ment billets and other perquisites common to his
class. Though endowed with the special advan-
tage of a handle, the noble Drummond hadn’t
enough native wit to earn a crust at home, so he
took the missus to America in the vain hope of
being able to hold his own with live Republicans.
Naturally, Drummond did no better than most
lords would under similar circumstances. His
hereditary brains were not equal to the task of
gaining a competence by legitimate means. He
became porter to a commission agent, and got the
“run.” Then the poor limp ex-masher obtained
(by influence, probably) a billet as night gateman
on the Elevated Railway. This involved such a
strain upon his understanding that Lord Drum-
mond finally collapsed last month. A London
Tory paper calls this “ a very romantic and beau-
tiful history.” To onr mind there is nothing very
beautiful about the inability of a lord—expen-
sively nurtured and educated—to make his way
In the world. If nineteen out of twenty porters
and gate-keepers had started on level terms with
Drummond they would now be writing comfort-
able cheques and trying—melancholy fact!—to
get into the sassiety of addle-pated aristocrats
who are “ properly provided for.”
Parkes told a deputation the other day that It
would be an interference with the liberty of the
subject and an act of tyranny to prevent Chinese
gardeners spreading garbage over the ground and
distributing liquid stinks over vegetables on Sun-
days. It must be an act of polite condescension,
then, to tell civilised, patriotic Australians that
they must not assemble in theatres on Sunday
evenings to listen to lectures which accord with
their beliefs ! Parkes is consistent. Freetrade
and support-alien-barbarians are synonymous
terms.

The champion mining spec, (in America) is to buy
shares in a company and then get an unsuspecting
newspaper to send a cow-headed reporter, who
doesn’t know blende from blue-metal, and couldn’t
tell pyrites from porphyry to save his life, to go
up and report on the thing. The report sends the
shares up a few or more shillings, the speculator
clears out, and* the newspaper rejoices in having
cast a “ luminosity of light ” upon one of the great
resources of the States. Such things never could
happen in Sydney, simply because a glowing
report of a reef published in one of the daily
papers would send the price of that scrip down
lower than wrapping-paper. The only way to
work the oracle in Sydney would be to engineer
the beauteous report after selling for a fall.

The question of how fast rabbits will in-
crease has been practically solved by a Riverina
squatter. The offspring from one pair of bunnies

interest than that.
There are bounds to the patience of the
N.Z. electors. Recently near Timaru the free and
independent had been tongue-thrashed by six
parliamentary candidates in succession. The fifth
and sixth had exhausted the last of the available
supply of antediluvian eggs and leprous oranges,
and when the seventh came along he was enthusi-
astically received with a tornado of curses and
old boots judiciously interspersed with cheers,
broken bottles, road metal, and other demonstra-
tions of confidence and esteem. After being
chased from the town to the local cemetery, and
his new bell-topper containing his undelivered ad-
dress kicked after him alorg the road, the would-
be M.P, took refuge from the storm behind a
tombstone, and coni inued in hiding t ill the electors
had dispersed to their several places of abode.
Then he crept out and went home to tell his wife
what a splendid reception he had had.

In a N.Q. police-court the other day a

who laid information against a brother townsman
for “ illegally branding a foal." The police officer
this time entered into the charge-hookas “ille-

were a bit mixed at that lock-up.
Mr. John Farrell has changed the name

Died,” and there is no reason why an eternal
truth should not echo from the crags and bluffs

Gunnedah, September 12. Dear Bulle
tin,— Mr. N. B, Downing, perambulating Free-
trader, has been paying us a visit, and a branch
of the Freetrade Association has been established
at Gunnedah. Our local 'Tiber describes the
matter thus: —“A branch of the Freetrade
League was then formed, seventeen persons enrollj
ing as members.” As the 'Tiber is on the spot, it
was of course useless to attempt passing on It the
old, lying, Freetrade fairy-tale telegram about the
wild enthusiasm of the Parkes horse-marines, but
the customary electric perjury was forwarded to
the Maitland Mercury, and ran thus:—“Mr.,
N. B. Downing, representative of the N.S.W.
Freetrade Association, addressed a large meeting
last evening on Freetrade, and met with a very
cordial recaption. Great enthusiasm prevailed,,
and a strong branch of the Association was
formed, about 50 members being enrolled.” Fifty
members, observe, though 50 grandmothers would
be quite as near the mark. The facts were these.
There were over 100 persons present, and half of
them had come under the Impression that
Preacher Downing was a conjurer or a sword-
swallower. When he had finished, 17 people
joined the League, but as 11 neglected to pay up
their fees, the branch now only consists of six
members. As this faithful few form the sum total
of one of the biggest of the Freetrade triumphs i
of which so much has been heard recently, you
can understand what a mass of atrocious bunkum'
and lies the whole crusade is. In addition tc
Downing, Gunnedah has been visited of late by
another wilted political flower—John Haynes. He'
was a complete failure. He played only to the
“gods,” and apparently he has all the impudence
and none of the tact of a book-fiend. Prior to bis
arrival here he wired to the editor of the NamOl
Independent, who is a staunch Protectionist,
and who never met him before, asking him to
engage a hall, bellman, &c. He did so, and the
roaring John repaid his courtesy by calling him a
miserable little wombat " cn the platform. “I’ll
save 'is skelp,” yelped the Mudgee failure, when
his opponent rose to move an amendment. The
itinerant mud-slinger pulled through by presenting
a double-barrelled motion in favour of decentrali-
sation and Freetrade, and those who voted for
decentralisation were thereupon set down as
staunch Freetraders. He was asked to put his
motions separately, but the artful little
man knew perfectly well that his miser-
able Freetrade screw could never get UP
the hill alone, so he refused. When he had
finished his parrot-like lesson Haynes came to tho
front of the platform and delivered a small whine
to the effect that he had to pay his own expenses,
and therefore he hoped the ladies and gentlemen
present would bring their friends next evening
and plank down their little sixpences to hoar his
“Press Recollections.” John Haynes never
argues, by the way ; his one resource is belching
forth abuse and vile epithets. Apparently his
Freetrade buffoonery Is only run to prop up his
own little entertainment, which is a thoroughly
original and by no means unpleasant shillings-
worth. Haynes is obviously not in earnest as a
statesman. His political speeches taken all round
are a great lark, for it is plain the festive John re-
gards this world merely as a fleeting show. Even
his abuse, though couched in stagey anathema
and bullock-punchers’ lingo, Is transparently
farcical. The fun will come along on the arrival
of th it not far distant day when John will round
on the Parkes gang. —Hermit 11.


SUNDRY SHOWS.
Theatre Koval— 1 " Silver King" -P. 14
Criterion Theatre.—" Twelfth Night «
Exhibition Building.— Roller Skating Elnk ..... ■■
Her Majesty's Theatre.— “ Henry V."..
The revival of that old favourite, the
“ Silver King,” at Sydney Royal, brought tears to
the eyes of many hundred elderly girls, and
caused them to snort behind their pockethandker-
chiefs till they blew those little bits of cambric
and filmy lace into rags. Some of them even
started to climb out of their clothes and sit on
top of them in their excitement, and the girls
who were decollete at the beginning of the per-
formance burst their shoulder-straps and grew
more decollete still as it progressed, till towards
the end they had very little on. The average
low-cut dress is not built to stand an internal
heave, and when the strain of emotion comes,
something must fly. Even the inside fixings
began to go when Wilfred Denver abandoned his
weeping wife and went off to Nevada to drag out
bis existence on beans amid scenes of woe,
where the tired mosquito’s anthem maddens
the turkey-buzzard, and aggravates the
wretched flea, and where the restless digger
barks melodies which remind him of
the past to the music of an old tin-pan ; and when
he returned to his long-lost partner and found her
camping in a cow-house, and, falling on her neck,
exclaimed, “Is it ya-hoo?” the excitement was
tremendous. It was her, but all the same he
needn’t have remained hanging on to her neck for
quite so long as a quarter of an hour ; a square
hug 15 minutes in duration grows monotonous.
But previous to this the anguish had been worked
up to such an extent by the report that he had
gone up in the ruins of a kerosene train that we
suppose the hero had to do something to keep the
roof of his head from flying off. Mr. Titheradge,
as usual, took the part of Wilfred Denver,
and it was the genuine pathos of his acting
that made the girls in the circle start to
ciimb out of their clothes. He did his level
best throughout; still, it was when he returned
loaded down with wealth from that wild western
land, where men collar the boodle and heave the
corpse out of the window, and where the noble
red man is fast vanishing into the setting sun,
that his success began in real earnest. But it
was on Nellie Denver, as played by Miss Isabel
Morris, that all the bald-headed men fixed their
opera-glasses in ecstasy. As for the impossible old
Jaikeshe was overshadowed on either side, and con-
sequently Mr. Anson hardly received the attention
he deserved, but, to make up for this, Mr. Beck
received a lot of attention, and the gallery wanted
to reward his obtrusive villainy with a brick.
There are about 36 more characters in the bill,
but we are going to work them off by instalments.
We have polisned off four this week, and in next
issue we will prospect with our accustomed
energy for some more, when Miss Jenny Watt-
Tanner shall have the first show. She deserves it.

“ Twelfth Night” is crowding up Sydney
Criterion, and the gilded citizens keep up a rush
for seats at an estimated rate of a greater distance
than Is usual in less time than has ever been
known before. This is our own calculation, but
some authorities declare that it is even more so
frequently. “ Twelfth Night ”is one of those
little things that Shakespeare used to dash off
without much regard to geography or anything
else—the “ coast of Bohemia” would suit him as
well as any other place, though Bohemia hasn’t
got any coast at present, and as his stock of foreign
names was apparently limited, he would plant a
Smith in Illyria, or describe a Tartar as Jenkins,
with afl the complacency of genius. Mtss Essie
Jenyns spreads her golden wings in the part of
Viola, alias Cesario, and as the latter she looks
her prettiest. Even in ordinary feminine attire
wo have always regarded Miss Jenyns as
a national blessing and a beneficent dispen-
sation of Providence, but in the garb of
Cesario she becomes an ornament to the hnman
race at large, and we are of opinion that some
one ought to get up a testimonial. Mr. Billiam
Holloway is more at home in Malvolio than he
ever was in the part of Romeo, but his voice gets
grittier every day, and he suffers from a frog in
the throat, and there is a pig’s whisper in his
tones when he tries to utter little tender trifles,
and his hair is cut short. Miss Constance Deor-
wyn made her first appearance this season as the
Countess Olivia, and caused a certain amount of
exuberance; and Mr. Inman perpetrated that lofty
cavalier, the Duke of Orsino, though he would
have perpetrated him better if he could have
added an inch or two to his figure. Sir Andrew
Agueoheek looked more of an ass than we ever
saw him before, and his long dreary face wore an
aggravated cold-pork tint, bat to make np for this
Sir Toby Belch was bulgier, mote pimpled, and
more uproarious than usual, and as a breezy, ex-
hilarating muff he deserves credit. The scenery
was gorgeous, especially the scene on the coast of
Illyria, where the rugged cliffs were painted ao
realistically that one might easily fall over them
and break his neck under the impression that they
were genuine.

At the theatre named after the lady who is
pre-eminent in grief, “ Henry V.” still waves the
knee-pan of a deceased cat in the front of the
battle, but he won’t do so any longer after this
week. We are glad to mention this fact. Henry,
no doubt, was as brave a man as ever refused to
jell when he got his corn stamped upon, but
owing to ill-health we are prepared to sell him
very cheap or exchange him for anything that
won’t tear about quite so much. Also our sym-
pathies are all with the poor French potentate who
went cranky, and we think it is positively in-
decent for Henry to go on the way he does when
he ought to be repenting of his sins. “ Alone,”
and “Black-Eyed Susan” form Mr. Rignold's
bill of lading for next Saturday.

is as bright as paint, varnish, gilding, and uphol-

Herr Schoot, “the Great Drum Per-

“Battle of Tel-el-Kebir ” at Sydney Alhambra.
We don’t bear him any ill-will for this, but if he
will come out shooting with us we will acciden-
tally hit him in the back of the head. The rest of
the performance is as bright as usual, and in that
calm hour of darkness, when all is hushed except
the surprised scream of the cat as it breaks the
record three howls ahead of tha fljing brickbat,
and the anthem of the effete goat as it makes a
light supper upon our pretty flowers, the music
that issues from Smith’s temple of joy can be
heard some distance, or even further. Certain
people assert that it is audible a longer distance
than that even, but we regard this statement in
the light of an exaggeration.

Brough and Bouci-

Opera House arrives at
its latter end on October
7th, and a cheaper and
hasty production of “ Our
Boys” is playing the
season out. The wealthy
butterman’s mansion ap-
pears to have been fur-
nished on time-payment.
The baronets drawing-
room is also bleak and
desolate. Nevertheless,
a section of the company
contrives to pull things
through. The original
Talbot Champneys of Mr.
Tom Thorne is carefully
copied, and, perhaps, im-
proved upon, by Bouci-
cault fils. Mr. Royce runs
Perkyn Middlewick on
rorty lines of his own, and
Fred. Laye, more earnest
and careful than usual,
comes out strong as Gharry- Both the Melrose
girls look nice enough to fight and die for, but
these remarks don’t apply to old Champneys or his
sister. There are no marked features about Miss
Robina's assumption of Belinda, except soot and
i curl-papers. According to present appearances,
the Opera House will be “To Let” after next
week, unless B. and B, see their way to continue
a business which has been remunerative enough
during their twelve months’ term. Fate con-
tinues kind to them at the Bijou, where “ Held by
the Enemy” is good for another three weeks,
anyhow. There was an uncanny fascination about
the muffled figure on a stretcher from the first.
But now he is brought nearer to the footlights,
the surgeon fingers the plac’d brow in professional
style, and the whole house is hushed in the pre-
sence of death. ’Tis a big situation, this. It re-
minds us that we are but strangers and sojourners

Minnie Palmer took a formidable pile of
trunks on her return to America, which, remarks
a Honolulu paper, were filled with rare and costly
presents, showered upon her by governors and
statesmen and a host of less distinguished Aus-
tralian admirers. At latest, Minnie was playing
at Bush-street theatre, ’Frisco, and was getting
this sort of thing ladled out to her by the truth-
ful Pixley “ Her diamonds appear to be of the
first water. One goes to the theatre to see Miss
Minnie Palmer because she has been so thoroughly,
so systematically, o ven so aggressively advertised.
One comes away as soon as possible, because Miss
Minnie Palmer does not for a moment suggest
that she can possibly be the person who inspired
these advertisements. She is not arch, sprightly,
merry, kittenish, or any of the stock things which
it Is so easy and so natural for little women to be.
She is a starched, stiff, prim, serious little person,
without one redeeming ounce of dramatic talent.
. . , The English are easily amused, as the
past summer has shown, and it can only have
been pure conservatism. They liked Minnie
Palmer best because they liked her first, and the
Englishman never stultifies himself.”

The Australian rights of “The Bells of

asserted that the Sydney Freetrade Associatitn

august but not wealthy body decided to make a
public exhibition of their chivalrous temerity by
hiring the new Masonic Ha l as the scene of their
show. Their valour was not without prudence.
Stealthily and by circular they strove throughout
the previous week to rally up their own supporters,
but—fearful lest irate Protectionists should accu-
mulate eggs and cabbage-stalks, emblems of the
dead and bygone past—let no rews of the in-
tended demonstration reach the vulgar crowd until
the Saturday afternoon prior to the ceremony. It
was not thought possible that many eggs could be
hoarded in 48 hours. And the president of the
Association showed marvellous prudence also. He
was absent. As he had to prosecute at Hay he
could not orate at Sydney. And in his apology
we see the dawn of a brighter era, when At-
torneys-General shall be found willing to forego
their own important engagements in order to at-
tend the unrequited duties of their office. It may
be that South Sydney electors will say that the
A. G. was afraid to show at a meeting held in
his own constituency, and will assert that his
present steadfastness in determining to prosecute
at Hay is not matched by many other incidents in
his official career ; but to such scoffers he can re-
ply that, like Frt derick, he is the slave of duty,
and values more highly a clear conscience—and a
whole skin -than all the guerdons an electorate
can give.
Few have been robbed by highwaymen,
many by lawyers, and all by landlords.
The Referee
Amateur Brett trains Hanlan for his race
with Beach on the Nepean. Brett has been row-
ing continuously since about 1876, and has pro-
bably won more trophies than any rowing amateur
in the world. Hanlan is not a bad-looking fellow,
and he is slightly aware of the fact. W hen stay-
ing at the M.R.C. Branch, his chair was placed
opposite a full-length portrait of himself, rigged
up in *' long-tailed banger,” stove pipe hat, &c.
Ned used to sit and gaze spellbound upon this
picture, and the M.R.C. funny man says they had
to have it re-glazed after Hanlan’s departure, his
piercing ogles having worn a hole in the glass.

Slavin offers to box the champion, Peter
Jackson, to a finish for £250, the venue to be any-
where Jackson likes, so long as it is 200 miles out
of Sydney, Jackson to receive £5O for expenses so
soon as he puts up a substantial deposit to bind
the match. It does not much matter it they
fight at Timbuctoo, Jackson must win- Slavin
says Dooley must make a reputation before he
meets him. This is rich. Slavin has made his
reputation on the defeat of Yankee Costello, who
could not knock M‘Car thy out in three hours,
whilst M‘Carthy the other night was unable to
give Gorman, a fourth or fifth-rate man. his
quietus. When Dooley last met Slavin he had the
Queenslander beaten at one part of the fight.,
when he threw his chance away by bad general-
ship. Slavin must not talk of reputation.

Australian Peer and his jockey Gorry de-
serve more praise than they have yet got for their
win in the Randwick Plate. Trident may have
been “a bit off,” but he was on the occasion
scarcely the cripple they try to make him out,
Gorry showed great judgment in challenging
Hales where the weight told most —at the bid.
The time for the last mile and a quarter, 2 min.
lOjsec., showed that even had Trident been at his
best it was no certainty for him. Hales’ desperate
efforts were without avail, and the Peer won
comfortably by a couple of lengths in smin 51 Jsec.
Some of the bookmakers won large sums over the
Peer’s victory. The second Hurdle Race fell to
Speculation, and the Charmer and Enigma ran a
dead heat for the Members’ Handicap, the owners
agreeing to divide. Dunlop, at 7 to 1, appropriated
the Waverley Handicap from Algerian ; and Ruby,
at 6 to 4, won the Steeplechase from The Hatter.
Twenty three sported silk for the Free Handicap,
which was appropriated by the 20 to 1 chance
Teddy. Yuille.

The Nooze seems greatly depressed over
the absence of a smashed-up jockey in the Steeple-
chase at Randwick, and says the croakers who
foretold a list of accidents over the raised fences
must have felt small when every horse finished
in the race. As the first croaker, we may inform
the Nooze man that on Friday last the fences
were lowered and canted over, bringing them
down to about 3ft. XOin , a slight difference to the
4ft. 2!in. they were on the previous Wednesday,
as measured by a couple of prominent steeplechase
owners. Had they remained at 4ft. 2|in. it would
have been a great day out for the “ books "—if
not for the jockeys ; the favourite and winner.
Ruby struck heavily as it was, and would have
come down for a certainty at the increased
height.

The last five-style wrestle between Can-
non and Dunn has just about settled the game in
Melbourne for the present. A few infatuated
creatures paid their money in the expectation of
seeing Cannon strangle his opponent at Giaeco-
Roman. In default of this blessed consummation
Dunn secured an “unexpected” fall, and Cannon
retired from the contest in seeming anger. Then
the limited attendance began to curec and to swear
that the whole thing was bogus.

Pedestrianism is getting worse instead of
getting better. The class of gentry who turned
up at Lillie-brldge grounds to see Hutchens and
Gent perform can be judged from recent cable-
grams. For years this branch of “sport" has
been bossed by the rag tag crew which broke up
the Prize Ring and made an English professional
rowing match something to be avoided like the
plague. Running has now sunk to the level of
“trotting,” which is in the very last stage of
decline. In the one case vehicles are usually
smashed up and burned—at Lillie-bridge the
roughs appear to have bonfired the grand stand.
We almost wonder that they didn’t cremate
Hutchens and Gent.

The Victorian football premiership goes to
Carlton Club this season, Geelong second, and
South Melbourne a moderate third. Which re-
minds us that the Melbourne Herald has taken
to publishing wood-cut portraits of prominent
footballers. A footballer, as he appears in wood-
cut, is a guileless creature who wouldn’t hurt a
lly.

That burglar scare under which the Vic-
torian capital suffered for some weeks troubles
nobody any more. It was hot enough till “A. B.”
took up his little pen and wrote to the Herald,
when public confidence was restored, and saasiety
ate, drank, and waxed merrier than ever. An
extract from “A.B.’s” communication will ex-
plain matters; —
“ Kindly allow me through your va’uable paper to state
that I have invented a trap for catching burglar?. Of oours i
Ido not mean poPoetnen. I can construct it so that it will
kill the person caught, if desired. It will also ring an alarm
bell at the same time. The cost would be very trifling, and
it can be placed at the entrance of a doorway or anywhere on
the premises without attracting attention.”
A labour-raving apparatus like this commended
itself for obvious reasons. One trial sufficed to
prove the usefulness of the invention, and now no
well regulated family retires to rest without
hitching a ‘ burgular’-traptothe frontdoor. Pater-
familias doesn’t dig his wife in the ribs and tell
her to get up and make enquiries when he is
awakened by aery of anguish from the hall. He just
telephones to the University dissecting-room “Como
for corpse at earliest convenience,” and goes on
dreaming as before. In the interests of justice,
no accounts of these tragedies are supplied to the
daily papers, but we happen to know that a
Collins-street jeweller “bagged” nine burglars
last week. Ere our lines appear in print the race
will be extinct:

“Edward Hanlan arrived to-day from

Wooden-headed alderman, spare that tree,
for in the suburban boroughs of Sydney the masses
of foliage that used once to afford people shelter
in the sweltering summer, and absorb the malari-
ous gases and purity the atmosphere which man
had polluted are becoming woefully scarce.
To ere are cess-pits in plenty, also jam-tins, kero-
sene-tins, wrecked crinolines, battered dress-
improvers, and other relics to show where some
unhappy female has foundered on the highway ;
rags, bones, boots, bottles, oyster shells, stove-in
hats with kitchen grease inside, hoops, old pans
containing the late lamented feline, and other
things galore, and to these the outside municipal
hippopotamus raises no objection, but whenever
he catches sight of a tree on the edge of the high-
way, or anywhere else within his jurisdiction,
he cuts it down and wheels the timber home to
his wife He shunts it along peacefully in his
barrow, and the wheel rolls over the hats and the
bottles and the oyster-shell?, and over the cat of
by-gone days, and over the symptoms of the lost
female until he reaches the back gate of his resi-
dence on the middle of a hare, bald, clean-shaved
allotment with a sham Grecian vase on top of
each ga e-post, and there he shoots it down with a
smile, saying, “Sairey, I’ve brought you some
wood! ” And there is a stump and a vacuum where
the tree once stood, and Nature abhors a vacuum, so
when the wood is gone she builds another
wooden-headed Goth instead and makes him an
alderman. And then he takes his axe, and, ac-
companiei by another municipal Vandal and the
Hun who serves as Town Clerk, he goes out and
cuts down more trees, and wheels the loliage
home to his particular Sairey at his own back
gate till the whole district is bare and covered
with bottles and the remains of dress-improvers.
But it seems to bo nobody’s business to split the
aldermen and put his tun bar head in the stove; he
is protected by tho Dog Act or the local Hyaena
Act or something, and he goes on his way re-

trusively and shook hands with two friends who
had come and wn to feast their eyes on his propor-
tions. He explained that the remainder of the
gang were not there because he had omitted to
write to them —otherwise they would have turned
up and made a great chavoo. Somehow we have
our doubts. We have grown weary to the point
of utter loathing at the very names of the fat
Beach and the thin Hanlan, and we care very
little for the delusions of any retail bargee with
hardly any clothes on ; but we don’t want Ned of

known persons who yell for Victoria on the
Queen’s Birthday, and “holler” for the Stars and
btripes on the 4th July, and in addition to
this they scream for Wales, and bow down to the
Kaiser of Germany. They used to allude to
Hanlan as “the great American sculler,” and
when he began to lose races they described him as
“a Canadian rower, named Hanlan.” Ned has
this time struck them when they were in the

There is a sound of weeping at Thomson’s
Crossing on the Darling’s moral shore where one
more bank clerk has gone wrong, in a back-
blocks township the nice-looking bank clerk is a
sort of ministering angel lent for a space by Provi-
dence that he may impart an aroma of lestheticism
to the social atmosphere, and when his mis-
sion is accomplished he spreads his gossamer
wings and silently flies away, and the region of
the saffron cew and the early bird knows him no
more. He is a thing too delicate and beautiful for
these rude surroundings, hut he brings with him a
halo of sweetness and light, and with him it de-
parts, The clerk of whom we write was a pen-
sive-lookicg youth of 21, and his alabaster brow is
still remembered with adoration by all the
marri igeable girls of the neighbourhood. He was
anew chum, and his early life had been spent in
writing out insurance policies in a Scotch fire
office, whereby the chattels of Dugald M‘ ravish
were protected from loss bv conflagration, and he
had also enjoyed considerable experience at lick-
ing stumps and in other branches in the lower walks
of commerce. Also he was a mild and Y.M.C.A
youth, and when he entered the hank one mum-
ing with his collar burst and a swivelling expres-
sion in his eye the boss thought he was gazing oa
a vision. Ha watched him anxiously, and when
Grocer Smith came in to cash a cheque, he ob-
served him take out a scoopfull or sovereigns
from the drawer and tender them with a
leaden gaze to the customer, saying feebly ;
“He yelp yourself, old fler.” Then he
addressed him more in sorrow than in anger.
“ Mr, Jones, Do you know what you are doing
this morning ? ” “ No, sir.” “ What were you
attempting just now?” “Hie dunno, sir.
Can’s shay m’sura. Hie .” “Do you know
anything at all, sir?” demanded the superior
otti cer, sternly, and then a glimmer of old recollec-
tions came over the misguided clerk of Thomson's
Crossing, and he started off as fast as he c m and
gabble : “ Course I do. Know lots o’ zhings you
never dreamt of—hie. D’ y’ ever hear this-
warranted that no paraffin, petroleum or other
mineral oil or liquid product thereof be ’posited
or kept fr sale on premisssh deshcribed in zhish
polishy. You couldn't shay that ole rooster,” he
added, affectionately putting his arms round the
manager’s neck. “ Awf’ly iggorant indidviduah
Know lotsh more zhings s'pose never heard ztiish
eisher—in event of gunpowder or other ex-
ploshlves being kept in premisesh zhish

age—hie—in case of insurances exhishting
in uzzer offloesh amountsh to be declared in event
of losh. Ole fler, bet tou months shcrew you
couldn’t shay zat right off, ’ he added in a burst of
confidence, and then he fell asleep standing, his
head gently sinking into the manager’s shirt front,
and began to dream of old times in the insurance
office. He was put away under the counter, and
when he awoke towards sunset he was igno-
minously sacked. And that is why the maidens
weep at Thomson's Crossing, for the new bank
clerk is married and has a face that looks as if he
had been involved in the fall of a four-story house
in the happy days of childhood, and the alabaster
brow of the former youth is now only the memory
of a joy that has for ever flown.

J.c was midnight, and a solitary pilgrim
was wearily towing himself along the intermin-
able road which winds by the banks of the solemn
silent, ever-flowing Jenkins River. He was a
tall, reddish figure, with long, wobbly legs, and
he had been born of rich but honest parents. He
was also drunk, and as he trudged along he kept
himself awake with judicious conundrums as to
how his wife would receive him, or—as he put it,
in his vulgar slangy way—how the old hen booj um
would cut up. When he reached his humble
home, however, this point was spesdily settled
he was locked out. lie sat and sang in the yard
for an hour in the hope of harrowing the old
woman’s feeling?, but she made no sign, and then he
zig-z agged down the street and tntervie wed the local
policeman. That officer looked at the matter in all
its bearings and advised him to enter by the
window, and then he started off again When he
had gone 10 yards into the darkness there c»me a
hail from the building he had just left. “Here,
come back," “Ay ?" “ Come back and shut the
gate.” “Wot?” “ Come back, dash you.” “O'a!
shut the gory gate yourself,” said the bounced
citizen, wearily, and then the aggravated con-
stable gave chase. Next day an astonished, red,
wobbly man got four months for being drunk and
disorderly and assaulting tbe police ; also obscene
language, wilful destruction of property, and
being illegally on tne premise?. A charge of
poi-onl g a valuable dog fell through, but. all the
same he has resolved that he will never tell a
rural policeman to shut a gate any more.

There are some points about the latter
end of Colonel Soudiekin, formerly of the Rus ian
Secret Police and now of the Beautiful Snore In
a rash moment he went and arrested a man named
Degaieff, a Nihilist who went out by the day, and
offered him the alternative of being hanged or
serving the police as a spy on his bomb-chro wing
brethren. Degaieff, who didn’t like the idea of
being hanged, accepted the Government billet
offered him, and then went and interviewed his
own chief, and asked him what on earth he was
to do now. The boss Nihilist made him stay to
ten, and they talked it over, and swilled ihe re-
freshing beverage out of their saucers, and blew
into tne tea to cool it, till at last, just as the chief
was taking his tenth piece of bread and buffer an
idea occurred to him. As the result Degaieff
worked for several months as a Government spy
during which time he informed against more than
20 warm adherents of the Czar and tittered when
he saw them hanged. Then somehow his party
grew suspicious of him, nnd resolved that he
should either kill the colonel or be killed hi nself,
so the poor Nihilist found things were get’irg
hot. But he was calm to the last. He stuck his fork
into the last dinner he ever hoped to oat on
earth : then he wrote out an elaborate account of
the Colonel’s death, and had it set up and p inf ed
in the Nihilist Paralyser, or whaler the
name of the conspirators' private print might be,
and fiaally he wandered down to the po ice de
partment and laid the paper before Soudiekin.
While that gentleman was reading the notice of
his own latter end his brains were blown over the
paper, and then the larky Nihilist batterei in the
head of the dead man’s nephew with an iron bar
and silently glode away. He was hanged shortly
afterwards.

Gaily I sing of the latest thing
For putting down marauders ;
This scheme sublime, explained in rhyme,
Will fright the lower orders ;
An ingenious chap with a burglar trap
His fortune now is making—
By this simple device, at a moderate price,
You entirely cheek house-breaking.
>Tis well to bait with silver plate,
Or diamond rings and watches—
At the slightest touch (it don’t want much)
That trap the rascal cotches ;
Before he can steal there’s a fearful squeal,
A splutter and a gurgling ;
Then everything’s stilled, for the villain is killed—
He never again goes burgling.
The trap is set once more, you bet,
And the tragedy’s repeated
Till, one by one, are the burglars done—
The cruse of crime depleted ;
Each ring of ne bell means another in—well,
Not before the ladies ;
All those burglars go to a region below,
Which poets describe as Hades.
Little I care for the recent scare,
I feel no apprehension ;
My golden hoard is thank the Loard ! —
Secured by this invention.
A snip and a snap of the burglar trap !
A silvery ring of warn ng 1
Another one caught —what remarkable sport 1
Bury him in the morning.

A MANUFACTURED MYSTERY.
There was a young lady named Laurer
Who shabbily served her adorer,
She jumped in the river—
May Heaven forgive her !—
At a moment when nobody saw her.
Then she screamed, and some gentlemen heard her,
But their evidence didn’t go furder,
Wild stories were printed
By papers which hinted,
In “ special editions,” at murder.
Though the captain was not over-plucky
(Or why on the river bank stuck he ?)
To trade on his troubles
By blowing false hubbies
. Was rough. So we call him unlucky
Be warned. If your girl takes a header
Because you’re not willing to wed her,
Let someone be present,
That things may go pleasant—
You can’t get the truth from a “ deader.”
You were feasted, Ned, and feted,
(Gracious! how we jubilated)
You were everywhere ovated —
All the papers made a row —
In the days that are departed,
Ere your down career was started,
You must really be sad hearted
When you think of then and now,
Quite as changeful are the masses
As the tides or weather-glasses,
And all worldly glory passes—
“ Sic transit, ’ as you know ;
No more banquets, Ned, or speeches,
Loud huzzas and urchins’ screeches—
All the honours now are Beach’s
That a people can bestow.
With Fizz again we’ll 1111 you,
With kindness try to kill you—
But not, 0 ! not until you
Can beat William—there’s the rub ;
If your sculling days arc ended,
Then the matter can’t be mended ;
A on must do as you intended —
Start a cosy little pub.
WHAT THEY WANTED,
A MELBOURNE BALLAD.
“ And now,” said the fond father,
As he stroked each golden curl
Of his merry youngest daughter,
‘ ’Tis your birthday, little girl.
“Tell me where you’d like to go —
Shall I take you to the Zoo,
Where you’ll see the Agile Gibbon
And the bounding kangaroo ? ”
“ Not there, not there, papa,”
Said the lover to his sweetheart—
“ Darling, 'tis a lovely day ;
There is beauty on the waters —
Shall I take you down the Bay 1 ”
“ Not there, not there, my love”
Said the husband to his wife, “ Dear,
Bow this day shall we employ ?
This day ten years we were married ;
It shall be a day of j oy.
Shall we, dearest, in remembrance
Of the good old times that were,
Take a double-teated buggy.
And drive out to Doncaster ? ”
“ Not there, not there, dear George.”
Said the son unto his mother—
“ Mother, you are growing old,
And your hair is getting thinner,
There is grey among the gold ;
“You must have some little pleasure
In this world before you go,
Shall I take you to the Waxworks—
’ Tis a most entrar c ng show ? ”
“ Not there, not there, my chi'd.”
Then thejittle gold-haired maiden,
And the virgin in her prime,
And the good wife, and old mother
In the evening of her time,
As with one voice cried together—
“ In these things ttmre is no fun ?
Oh, take me to an inquest,
If you love me,” sobbed each one.

Mr, Stuart Meuteath, a Wellington (N.Z.)

“ Coffee" Jones, an old-time Minister of

to manage other people s affairs, a pretty general
characteristic of men who cannot manage their

which has lost thousands under his presidency.
In private life he made no enemies, and was re-

Dear Bulletin, —Tne importation of coke

supply all demands ; but some managers believe
that no h'ng good can c >me from any other place

The opposition to the propose! grant to
Mr. Peter Lalor, the retiring Victorian Speaker,
comes from certain Orangemen, Mr Lalor being a
Roman Catholic. We do not say that any pro-
posal to make a grant should not be argued—on
its merits—but we do say that this display of
sectarian opposition to the reciguition of the
splendid services of the manly and llb=ral Peter
Lalor, who lost his arm in the fight for liberty at
Eureka Smckade, is a disgrace to the alleged
Christianity of the Pious and Immortal faction.

We like a man with a hobby, and although it may appear

It has been remarked that Mayor Riley, at
a recent quarterly civic luncheon, spoke- of the
Mayoress as “ a true Englishwoman.” Now, why
didn’t the Mayor try to make out that his popular
wife was “a true Australian ?" We are some-
what afraid that it is the proper cap *r in civic
circles to keep your eye on the Throne all the
time. From a Town Hall point of view, Hinger-
land is the source from which all blessings flow.

It is nob generally known that Mr. Dorn,
the successful petitioner in Dorn v. Nicholson,
used, during his lengthy incarceration in the
debtors’ ward of Darlinghurst prison, to solace his
riven soul by writing poetry, in which his friend the
lawyer co-re-pondent used to get an occasional
“ turn.” Apropos, revenge is still just as sweet to
humans as Bulged to be. Mr. Dorn, after sojourning
for a couple of years in durance vile, must feel
pretty happy now that he has “ taken it out ” of
the amorous Nicholson. Doin’s incarceration
was one of the iniquities of law. We now for-
mally pardon him for the poetry.

There is in Sydney an undertaker called

yard ail would bo still batter. In Melbourne there
is an undertaker called Raven. He advertises as

tu-er of contagion-prevenratlve coffins.” That is
the man we would like to bury us. No measles,
or whooping-cough, or diphtheria for us after we

The Tasmanian Government proposes to
put a poll-tax of £25 on all commercial travellers

ing-machine fiends come under this heading,
Tasmania will, when the scheme becomes law, be

live in- If tte Government would only go a little
further and put a prohibition-tax upon debt-col-
lectors, people would not want to leave Tasmania

A well-known gentleman jock told us the o r her
dav that whenever he gallops round the home-
t urn at Randwiok towards the finish of a race he
sees the race-club ambulance, drawn by two
horses, dashing at full speed across the course, its
destination being the dangerous corner where
horses and riders so often come to grief. A grim
thought, said our friend—to be ever fol'owed in
the race of life by what, if we make a fatal slip,

Here is a glittering bait. The Royal
Geographical Society of Australasia is about to
lit out an expedition to explore the still unknown
portion of Central Australia, and has sent out a
circular asking contributions, and winding up in
this way —“ Any leading support will be lastingly
rewarded by records on the geographical map of
the forthcoming expedition.” This will bo great
news to the Jugginses, Bugginses, Snookses,
M’Griffins, and other aristocrats. By the expendi-
tu-e of a paltry fifty pounds or po they will have
their fear fa 1 names indissolubly associated with
thia coatinent till the e*rth is rolled up like a
scroll. No doubt they will also stipulate for their
lit'es to be added. Fancy the coming generation
having to get by heart such names as
—Mount Sir Alexander Bloggs, Mount Augus-
tus Jobson, C.M G., Mount Mudge ! Lake Jag-
gins, J.P., M’Olattherduffy Lagoon, Snooks River I
When they grow up, the children who have to
commit to memory such geographical infamies
will make a pilgrimage to the graves of the parties
who proposed this villainy and dig up their re-
mains and hang and burn them as a warning to
others that posterity is not to be insulted with
impunity. The quack-doctors and patent-medi-
cine advertisers will, no doubt, be first in the field
with their coin and get the first show in the
scramble. Then we may expect to see that part
of the map scored over with inch atrocities as

and so forth. Thank heaven we shall (probably)

Thera is a journal published in Melbourne
called '• he Speculum. It is the organ of the
medical students. We clip the following cheerful
remarks from a late number Vacations are a
mistake. They come upon you in the midst of
your resignation to work, and they leave you un-
willing to buckle to again. Mayhap you have a
taking ulcer among your cases in the O.P. Depart-
ment. and vacation time comes and you leave it
to find, on return, that the interesting process of
healing has progressed rapidly, and you have
missed it. And very probably the pneumonia that
you had cheriihed has gone and died—and you
haven’t been to the post-mortem '' This is printed
in the part of the journal devoted to light reading,
and, no doubt, is considered by the readers almost
100 ’ effervescently gay. Judging by it wo can
imagine that when female medical students be-
come more numerous such conversations as the
following will bs quite common : —First Female
Medical Student (gushingly) : “Oh, dear, I have
suc'i a charming cancer given me to treat —you
would die of envy if you were to see it.” Second
Ditto: “Oh yes, and I have such a duck of a
corpse to dissect —and Dr. says I can have
it ail to myself I Isn’t he a lorn? By the way, I
am almost sure that the corpse is that of De Boozy,
who jilted your cousin Fanny two years ago,” &c.,
&c. There are verses published in the Specu lu m, but
they are poor stuff compared to the foregoing. The
Speculum poets should study the works of Charles
Baudelaire. If we remember rightly one of his
poems is dedicated to “ A. Red headed Girl with a ’
Cancer.” It L a sweet thing. One of the students
who knows enough of French should translate it.

Melbourne newspaper English as she is
wrote : “ Tne Federal Coffee Palace is one of the

back seat.

A Melbourne private-enquiry man was at
the Swain enquiry last week with a troop of
witnesses to prove that the unfortunate girl was
nob too good for the world which she left jo sud-

however, said that their evidence was not neces-
sary. Consequently, a lot of very nauseous details
ware left where they should be —in oblivion. The
Herald has been in a state of suppressed fury
with Mr. Coldham ever since.

Whiteley, the great universal provider of
London, has for several years not been able to get
his premises insured. His latest fire has cost him

heads his bills “ Black Book Account ” if he con-

Anyone with a fancy for speculation might
do worse than bet level money that Sir F. Napier

and now the podgy little autocrat suspends Chief

by the fact that the male party concerned has
another wife living, and that the parson who
married him to his second wife before the first one
was dead is said to have also written the love-
letters which enabled him to capture an unfor-
tunate female and lay her waste. This sort of
thing strikes us as being wrong—if not even im-
moral ; it is almost equal to a doctor running in
partnership with an undertaker. vv e speak thus
from experience, for we once wrote love-letters for
another man, andtheresult was unwholesome—we
might almost say malarious. His front name was
Bill, and he was our partner in days when we
dug for gold and very seldom found it. He
couldn’t write himself for sour apples, bat he was
madly in love with a barmaid in the next town-
snip—a dainty, high-heeled creature in white
muslin with pink spots, and at night we used to
go over to the warden’s oflioe and crib the Govern-
ment foolscap, and spread ourselves out for seven
pages of poetic fervour adorned with bursts of
verse and scraps of unflxable soulfulness about
stars and other things. Then we would read
these effusions to Bill, and when we came to a
sentence that covered half a page he would bang
the table, and say, “ By cripes, that’ll fetch
her !” But one unhappy day he went over to
conduct his wooing in person, and instead of
the overflow of high-toned rapture which
she had expected ho only made two re-
marks in the course of half-an hour. The first
had reference to her health, and in the course of
tne second, which ensued after he had sat still
and breathed hard for 15 minutes, he set forth
that his dog Joe, somehow or other, wouldn’t eat
beef when it was boiled. He came away sadly,
and we wrote no more letters to that girl on the
Palmer River. Perhaps, after all, Bill s unob'ru-
sive silence saved him a lot of after trouble.
Love-making by letter is, no . doubt, perfectly
legitimate, but when it leads a woman to marry a
man whom she imagines to have a poetic and fer-
vent soul, hut whose thoughts in reality never
soar above beef and taturs, she has good cause to
demand a separation. If Bill, when delivered
over to his bride, proves to be not equal to the
sample of Bill which was previously forwarded by
the post, then the contract should be void owing
to fraudulent misrepresentation, and we com-
mend this view of the case to Sir Alfred Stephen
and Dawvid Buchanan when next the subject of
divorce comes to the fore. Many a trusting nn-
literary woman has been taken in for belter or
worse by a lout who whispers scraps of Byron or
Shakespeare in her ear, and then, after marriage,
he takes her to nigger shows in preference to
opera, and fires the witticisms of the corner-man
at her head for a week after wards, and goes about
the house making day hideous with an inane
chorus of ti loorai-looral-lay, and it is high lime
that women who are thus afflicted should be fur-
nished with some means of escape from their
misery.

It was in Ring-street, outside a clever
florist’s, who, in honour seemingly of the racing
carnival, had designed a horse-shoe formed of
white azaleas with the words *' Metrop,, Dunlop ”
above and below it. When our melting orb rested
on it we said “Metropolitan Stakes.” The mean-
ing of Dunlop was clear. But to two gushing girl
things—the one in electric blue with a seven-
storied hat, the other In j übilee with a sailor hat
curled up with seven yards of red ribbon—the
meaning of the whole thing was hashed up to the
last degree. “O, did you ever ! ” squealed elec-
tric blue. ' ‘ Meet me, Dunlop. Oh I Who’s he ! ”
“ Don t know. How awfully nico, though, to
write ‘ Meet me ’ in azaleas, isn’t it 1 ” Then they

Peter Heinrich Schroeder, of Charters
Towers (Q.), has two wives, and one of the wives
has another husband, ccnsequently it becomes
rather a difficult matter to tell ihe exact relation-
ship existing between the second husband of
Peimich’s first wife and the soncf the second
wife’s father by his first marriage, always provid-
ing there was such an individual, whi -h is uncer-
tain, and doesn’t matter a hang anyhow. Hein-
r*ch first entered the holy bonds of matrimony at
Gympie in 1877, but apparently he did not make a
good impression on the lady with a chai leg, and
during his absence in Germany she married again
Heinrich returned and settle! in Char ers Towers,
and feeling lonely after awhile he (it is allegeo)
asked the Rev. Mr. King if he thought it would be
a good idea to advertise for a wife. Mr King is
reported to have considered it just possib’e that a
blessed union might be consummated in ihe
manner described, and the “ ad.” being duly in-
serted brought Miss Helen Fountain on the scene.
She thought stc might learn to love Heinrich,
and that gay German tailor did not think it need-
ful to explain that the photo, on which she based
th's hallucination had teen taken before he ac-
quired a large black patch on his face and got the
brand of Time set on him generally. When Helen
sighted him she found that he wasn’t exactly the
noble-looking youth she had expected, but fter
staggering two or three times she resolved to go
through with It, and though Schroeder wasn’t up
to sample she took him for better or worse. Tre
very next day the row began. Helen demanded
that her husband should remove the pa'ch which
he wore on his cheek, and when he dragged it off
she found that it covered a huge breathing-hole on
his face through which she could see down his
throat. He seemed rather proud of this orifice,
and staged that he was the only man in Australia
who could feed through the side of his head, but
Helen did not affoge’her share his exuberance.
In fact she regarded Peter Heinrich for a second
or two with a stony glare of dissatisfaction, and
then, after taking a lunar observation through
the tunnel in her husband’s countenance, and
gaining a comprehensive insight into his larynx,
she went upstairs to put on her bonnet and go
back to her childhood’s happy home. Her heart
was too full for utterance, and she felt, as.she
afterwards explained, that an old foreign tailor
with a gully in his head was not ihe tailor she
had bargained for. But whffe she was upstairs
ner husband was quietly soaking a towel in water,
and when she came to bid him good-bye he held
her down by t b e neck and laid the weapon about
the body of the woman whom he had promised to
love and cherish, till she cursed the unlucky
day when she had seen that advertisement.
After this she changed her mind about going
home, and she also abstained from further
comment on Peter Heinrich's appearance nntd
she learned, three weeks later, that he had
another wife living, and that she was being flipped
with a towel by a second hand husband with a
moth-eaten top, and then she fled in dismay and
took to dressmaking for a livelihood. Two years
of steady industry furnished her with enough
money to take proceedings against Peter Heinrich
and bring the head of the deceiver low and his
nose to the grindstone, and when last we heard of
him ho was out on bail, and his prospects seemed
about as unpromising as those of an old postage-
stamp that had been licked before. The way of
th e transgressor appears to be pretty hard up in
the land of the alligator and the gay and reckless
banana. #
An enviably lucky man is Mr. M'Greo, who
landed on the Melbourne wharf one day last week
in a penguin cap and sealskin boots. He was on
a voyage of pleasure round the world, and started
in the ship Dsrry Castle on 12th March last. She
went to pieces on the Auckland Islands, and only
he and seven others out of a crew of 23 were
saved. There was a piece of luck to start with,
but the real luck was in being cast ashore on a
desert island. Why, one might go round the
world for pleasure 50 times and never meet with
anything half so exciting. The eight Robinson
Crusees lived on raw seal for ten days ; then
M‘Gee—more luck—found a revolver cartridge in
his pocket with which he struck a light, in a
manner we have vainly tried for hours in the
days when we had serious intentions of taking up
' buccaneering as a profession. What a thrilling
' tale Mr. M'Gee will have to tell his friends when
he gets home ! How he will spread himself, to be
sure ! The stories he will tell about how he and
his mates drew lota which was to be killed for
food, and how the fatal lot came to him, and how
he closed his eyes and bent his neck to the toma-
hawk when -hurrah! A ship! And soon. If
we had such a chance to draw ghastly pictures of
those lonely islands in the Antarctic seas, and the
weird and awful time we had there, we would
never do a stroke of work for the rest of our life.

Two swells-—one a J.P., and the other
own brother to a well-known Victorian M.P.—
gob run in one night recently by the Hamilton
(Vic.) police on a charge of “righteous” be-
haviour. They had been to a fancy-dress ball at
the Town Hall, when, overcome by the heat, they
struggled into utter darkness and tumbled agin a
constable who appears to have been planted out-
side to see that no one ran away with the para
chutes. Explanations followed, but 20,021 was
not to be mollified Ho collared the near-sida
swell with an iron gdp to the imminent damage
of his last century cost ume, and scruffed him un-
gently to quod, followed by the other swell, who
offered, as a respectab’e J.P., to bail out his
friend. Did they take his ball! Not much. They
ran him in, too. Next morning all the local Potts
Pointers attended court to gloat over the sensa-
tion of witnessing the two ornaments of local
s a ssiety face the music in their festive attire. The
bench looked them over carefully, and then told
the Roman Soldier that he might retire with his
spear, and, as for his companion, who had mixed
his clothes somehow and was “ George Washing-
ton and his Hatchet ” at cne end, and the “ Last
Rose of Summer ” at the other, he was warned
not to get drunk and disorderly within measure-
able distance of a police station again or it would
be worse for him. As top’os of social conversa-
tion among local aristocrats, the inquest on Miss.
Laura Swain and the Dorn divorce case have
faded into nothingness beside this local bit of son
sationalism. We, however, don’t wonder at any-
thing a J.P. does.

A man fishing in the Murray at Echuca

The Jewish community in Melbourne is
“realmad’’with the Mayor of that ancient city. By
a singular coincidence the Mayor’s annual ball is
fixed for the panicu’ar date wh'n the Cbostn
People make atom in mt for their a r cumulated in-
discretions. No Jew worth tuppence —and most
of them are worth more than that—would dream
of breaking the Fast of Kipur, even in the calm
seclusion of his strong room. Therefore Mayoress
Cain is able to confine her invitation list strictly
to Gentiles. Hho wouldn’t insult Abrahams, or
Isaacs, or Jacobs with a pasteboard reminder that
chicken and champagne gratis will be gladdening
Christian interiors at a time when they, the strict
fasters, are pluckily endeavouring to satisfy the
first pangs of hunger with prayer and humiliation.
But seriously the big municipal, corrohoree ought
to be open to afi comers, doncherknow. If that
ball came off (as arranged) on the 28th, the Mel-
bourne Jews were compelled to make a social
sacrifice unforeseen by Moses And this reminds
us that there fs another conspiracy against the
election of A’derman Benjamin to the b’essed
chair. No ques'ion of a possible Jubilee knight-
hood (delusive rope !) stands in the way this year,
so in common decency the common councilmen
should make little Benjam’n their ruler.

ing slanged his Excel-
lency to his heart's con-
tent in the columns of

cis quite unexpectedly
caved in and made a
public apology which
was most graciously re-
ceived by a very badly
treated Governor. Sir
Francis' contention was
that there was a clear
limit to the Governor’s
exercise of the Royal pre-
rogative of mercy. As a
matter of fact, there is
no limit whatsoever.
The Imperial instructions
to the Governor provide
that H E., after hearing
what the Executive has
to say, is to decide such
matters on his own re-
sponsibility alone.

Here is an awful lesson to people who
won’t mind their own business. At Cooktown
(Q ) a white woman, who had grown tired of
civilisation and wearing a bustle, went out and
joined the blacks, and for a year or two they all
went round together and said, “ What a day we re
having!” But at last an interfering old fcol
heard of it, and felt it incumbent on him to
reclaim the woman and make her wear a bustle
once more. Accordingly the police were sent out
in pursuit and dropped on the innocent lamb of
50, and proceeded to bring her back on horseback.
But the blacks resisted, and scrimmaged wiih He
officers, and the next moment they and the horse
and the lamb all went down together in a heap,
and when they were disentangled it was found
! that she had been sat on and was dying. Too-
mueb-interfering old philanthropist had brought
her to an untimely end.

It was a daring woman who put this
advertisement in the Age : Lost, at Albert

however, it is not bigger than a horse-collar. By
the way, we have never yet seen an advertisement
from a woman concerning a lost tongue. Ihey
never lose that. And yet their tongues are often
as false as their teeth.

Govern or Carington’s fluakeys were the
most gorgeous part of the show at the opening of
the N.S.W. Parliament. There were two of them
—Jeames and Tummas. Jeames was tall and
solemn-looking, and his hair was covered with
grease and flour, and combed back so hard that
he couldn’t shut his mouth, and his left ear was
strained out of the perpendicular. He had on apair
of imposing calves, which were calculated to hold
up a falling house ; he was attired in numerous
colours, and his aspect said, “Gaze on me.”
Tummas was evidently of a more airy disposition,
and, though his hair nearly lifted him off his feet
he wore an engaging smile and a cold. His legs,
viewed in their remote relation to his head, had a
subdued fervour which contrasted distinctly with
the coldly practical and aristocratic shanks of
Jeames, and the heave of his stomach showed
him to be of an imaginative disposition. He
would not roll down hill so easily as his com
panion, nor would he be likely to fall so softly when
he got to the bottom, but he had more points
about him. Jeames and Tummas were un-
doubtedly the two great features of the display
and compared to them, the Lancers, the police
and even the Governor himself passed almost un-
noticed. If Lord Carlngton wishes to attract any
attention at his next public appearance he will
have to put Jeames and Tummas in the carriage
and stand at the hack himself.

The eastern side of Wynyard-square,
Sydney, is to be known in future as Montague-
street, which is Secretary Garrett’s way of paying
his respects to Mr. Montague Levey, a deceased
capitalist who once lived In that locality. We
mention this circumstance to prevent an idea get
ting about that the street is christened after
Montague Tigg, the friend and companion of
“TAKEN IN HAND.”
“The crew and passengers of the cutter. Two Friends, went on shore at Karaeja,
Bowen Straits, and were killed and eaten. The Collector of Customs has recommended
that the authorities at Port Darwin should take the matter in hand.”
The authorities aforesaid are here depicted in the act of taking in hand all that is
left of the matter.
Chevy Slyme, or William Drogo Montagu, Duke
of Manchester. The street in which Mr. Montague
Levey livedis to he named Montague-street because
Levey-street would be almost as indefinite as
Cohen-street or Ahraham-square, and it is not to
be named Benjamin-street, because Mr. Levey’s
name never was Benjamin. The Sydney D.T.
states that Mr. Levey always took a deep interest
in the patch of grass in the middle of the square,
and while he lived anyone who shied old jam-tins
across the railings was sure to get it hot.

The ball at Government House, Sydney, on
the 16th inst, proved a decided success, although,
owing to the humorous tendencies of the secretary,
or some other cause, the invitations were, from a
Darling Point of view, somewhat mixed. Lady

on the skirt and magnificent diamond ornaments.

“ beautiful illuminated address on silk, hand-

monial game about as low as it will go:—

And never felt ashamed—
So they wrote his virtues down on silk,

The principals in the above interesting perform-
ance are members of the noble Queensland
aboriginal race. The happy pair having been
united, they duly attended the wedding feast
before starting on their honeymoon trip to the
Mackenzie scrubs. The breakfast, elaborately
served on a highly-scented ’possum-rug, consisted
of the near hind-leg of an old-man kangaroo, a la
venison, ’possums and bandicoots roasted with
the original stuffing in them, iguanas, carpet-
snake, pieces of bread from the backyards of
greedy fellow whitefellow, sugar-bag, See., the
whole being washed down with pure snake-
juice from a rum-cask. Several speeches
were made, and the healths of the blushing
bride and her adopted husband were drunk most
enthusiastically. The dress of the bride consisted
of a brown winsey skirt hanging from one
shoulder, stockings of pipeclay, and the orna-
ments—a necklace and earrings of glass beads.
The bridegroom wore a well-fitting suit of red and
white raddle, while round his waist hung a red
handkerchief suspended from the waistband of a
pair of moleskin trousers. In his hair he had
numerous cockatoo feathers to denote his clan.
The wedding presents were numerous and costly,
consisting of one tomahawk, one knife, half a fig
of tobacco, red handkerchief, looking glass, comb,
several dilly hags, a belltopper hat (the gift of
his employe?), opossum skin, some shells, boo-
merangs, nulla nullas, spears, a razor (cost price,
one bob), and a black clay pipe.

The accident which led to the drowning
of Major Robilliard in Jervis Bay is, we are

the seaman who was on watch at the
time on hoard the Nelson. Although the mis-
hap occurred on a fine, clear day, and the
Nelson lay within three miles of the spot, the cap-
sized party were left clinging to their boat for an
hour and a half, and ultimately Major Rohilliard’a
strength was exhausted, and his companions
being too weak to render him any further assist-
ance, he sank. He had suffered ’me time pre-

also from heart-disease, and was thus fitted

What Warner’s Safe Cure Cures
and Why.
Congestion of the Kidneys, Back Ache, Inflamma-
tion of the Kidneys, Bladder, or Urinary
Organs ; Oatarrah of the Bladder, Gravel,
Stone, Dropsy, General Debility,
Bright’s Disease.
Why? Because it is the “only remedy known
that has power to expel the uric acid and urea,”
of which there are some 500 grains secreted each
day as the result of muscular action, and sufficient,
if retained in the blood, “to kill six men.” It is
the direct cause of all the above diseases, as well
as of Heart Disease, Rheumatism. Apoplexy,
Paralysis, Insanity and Death.
This great specific relieves the kidneys of too
much blood, frees them from a'l irritants, restores
them to healthy action by its certain and soothing
power.
It cures also Jaundice, Enlargement of the Liver,
Abscess and Oatarrah of the Bile Ducts, Bilious-
ness, Headache, Furred tongue, Sleeplessness,
Langour, Debility. Constipation Gall Stones, and
every unpleasant sjmptom which results from
liver complaint.
Why ? Because it has a specific and positive
action on the liver as well as on the kidneys,
increasing the secretion and flow of bile, removes
unhealthful formations, and in a word, restores
it to natural activity, without which health is an
impossibility.
It cures also the many disorders from which the
gentler sex silently suffer.
Why? All these troubles, as is well known by
every physician of education,” arise from con-
gestion," and impaired kidtey actiion, causing
stagnation of the blood vessels and breaking down,
and this is the beginning and the direct cause of
all the ailments from which women suffer.
Why Warner’s Safe Cure is acknowledged by
thousands of our best medical men to be “the only
true blood purifier,” is because it acts upon
scientific principles, striking at the very root of
the disorder by its action on the kidneys and
liver. “For if these organs were kept in health
all the morbid waste matter, so deadly poisonous
if retained in the body, is passed out.” On tbe
contrary, if they are deranged, the acids are taken
up by the blood, decomposing it and carrying
death to the most remote part of the body.
Ninety-three per cent, of all diseases which
afflict humanity, arise from Impaired kidneys, as
shown by medical authorities. Warner’s Safe Cure,
by its direct action, positively restores them to
healthy and full working capacity, “nature curing
all the above diseases herself” when the cause is
removed. As you value health take it to avoid
sickness, as it will at all times and under all
circumstances keep all the vital functions up to
par.
We also “Guarantee a Cure” and beneficial
effect for each of the foregoing diseases; also that
every case of Liver and Kidney trouble can be
cured where degeneration has not taken place,
and even then benefit will surely be derived.. In
every instance it has established its claim. As a
Blood Purifier, particulary, it is unequalled, for
you cannot have pure blood when the kidneys or
liver are out of order.
“ Look to your condition at once. ’’ The Spring
of the year is the time when your system needs
a general toning up, to'successfully copo'with the
hot weather soon to be upon us. Do not postpone
treatment for a day nor an hour, “The doctors
cannot compare records with us ” Give yourself
thorough constitutional treatment with Warner’s
Safe Cure, and there are yet many years of life
and health assured you I
Australia is threatened with a further in-
flux of English alleged noblemen. However, we

This is the season when the blithesome
crank goes out and executes his mother in the
back-yard, and seeks his father with a crowbar.
Summer is approaching, and the lunatic makes
notes in his diary thusly : “ October 1, weather
fine and hot. Killed a girl.” The long-haired
crank is getting his hair cut, and the short-haired
crank is offering up his relatives on the sacrificial
altar. August Wells, of Liverpool. N.S.W., is
the secon dof the new season’s crop of lunatic?. On
Thursday last he tipped his ma backwards into a
well, and, as Sydney D.T. ably puts it. this throws
an “ additional glamour of terrible interest” over
the case. This is the first time we have heard of
a “ glamour ” being thrown round an old lady in
a well, but let us go on. The Telegraph further
observes:—
" We have no horror-stricken eye-witnesses to the crime-
no one even to testify to having heard the screams of the
poor old hard-working woman as she quailed, with the dews
of deathly terror on her face, under the frenzied eyes and
murderous grip of the son to whom she had given birth.
Imagination fails when one tries to speculate But
not far did she fly. With the cunning of a madmau he
divined her purpose, with the fury of a madman at the pos-
sible loss of his victim he bounded after her ’’ (bounded is
good) “ and with the strength of a madman overpowered
her, dragged her back and flung her, half-dead with terror,
into the deep well, where, could he have kept his secret, she
might have lain undiscovered for months. Then, no doubt,
with an exulting chuckle as he heard the horrid splash which
told him he had done his foul work only too well, he pulled
himself together ”
This being the season for cranks we demand that
the man who wrote this paragraph shall be put
under restraint at once. A desire to write half-a-
column of gnsh about a murder is one of the first
symptoms of homicidal mania. When the disease
advances to the next stage the patient will pro-
bably tear off Mr. Fred. Ward’s ears and serve up
the office-boy with carrot-trimmings. Let him bo
chained up in the cellar ere it is too late or the
“horrid splash” he writes about will not be a
circumstance compared to the splash that will be
made by the D.T. when it has a chance of writing
four columns about the ruthless assassination of
its bearded editor.

A CURE for PULMONARY CONSUMPTION.
< To the consumptive, and those who suffer from
asthma, bronchitis, coughs, colds, haemorrhage,
and other affections of the lungs, this no .ice is of
vital importance, for this remedy will effect a
perfect cure of the most stubborn cases.
It has renewed the life of many whose condition
had been pronounced beyond remedy by members
of the medical profession.
The afflicted need have no fear of it, and must
not regard this advertisement as the ordinary notice
of some quack medicine. The qualities of the
preparation are cleaning and healing, causes easy
and copions expectoration, and heals the lungs
through the blood, promotes digestion, and thus
aids the stomach to digest and assimilate nourish-
ing food for the formation of pure vitalising blood,
to repair diseased tissues, and maintain the vital
powers.
On application for reference we will send the
addresses and testimonials of those persons whom
it has cured, whose names and position in society
at once places the veracity of their statements
above question, and who are now living in Sydney,
Newcastle, Maitland, and especially in the district
of Tamworth, where this remedy has been known
and used for the last thirty years, and where there
are hundreds of living monuments of its wonderful
curative qualities.

- AMALGAMATED SHEARERS’ UNION
OF AUSTRALASIA.
IN consequence of there being many false re-
ports in circulation, we beg to inform all con-
cerned that no alteration whatever has been made
in the rules of the Union. The clause pioviding
penalty on members discharged is not compulsory’!
and need not be added unless members agree to
compromise with sheepowner to that extent. No
permanent change in either rules or agreements
will be made until after members’ views have
been obtained and a conference held with sheep-
owners. The report that we have adopted clause
fining members £2 in certain cases is not correct,
and rio concession whatever has been made by us,
except the suggestion of line for bad shearing,
which we leave in members’ own hands
for adoption or otherwise. Members are
informed that the Press contains many
reports quite incorrect, and as we cannot possibly
contradict all of them, we hope they will take no
notice of what they read or hear except from
authorised agents or the Union officers. Strong
attempts are being made to sow dissention amongst
members by circulating incorrect statements such
as that we have adopted second price, &c. The
object is to split the Union. The latter is a great
success so far, and if members will remain true to
it everything will work well next year, as all
opposition will be overcome.

KI C K
Mr. W. Martin Forster, the well-known chemist
Of M«ckay, Queensland, sends the folio wing letter
to tbe Charles A, Vegeler Company, the proprietors
of Sr. Jacobs oil:
“Gentlemen.—
“Although I am aware it is contrary to the
cur tom of the trade to publicly endorse a patent
medicine of foreign origin, yet I think I miy be
pardoned for saying a few words in favor of St.
Jacobs oil. Ab; ut a year ago 1 reco red a severe
kick on ihe leg fi om a horse; so severe, indeed,
that I fully expected to be incapacitated, from
attending to my busu ess for at least a forti ight.
I received the injury ai night, and bef< re morning
the leg had swollen to an e iorraoua size. The
pain was very acute, ai d I wa-< unable to do any*
thing for myself, my assistant being absent. In
this emergency, by my wife’s aio, I procured
from the shop a bottle of St Jacobs oil, with which
I soaked a pad of lint and kept it applied to the
injured part for a few hours, when, to my surprise
and delight, the pain left, and before night I was
able to alter dto my business. I may say I
suffered no further inconvenience from the kick
although an enlargement cf the hone, which
remained for several months afterward, attested
prett y substantially the severity of the blow dealt
me 1»y the horse. I am, gentlemen, yours faitbfully,

Unadulterated flattery from aN.Q. paper ;
—“ While not holding with the views expressed
by the lecturer, we must give him credit for his
skill in manipulating texts of Scripture to suit his
own views.!’
Moorhouse, of Manchester, says that
“ when he left Victoria a small but noisy party,
consisting princirally of young men born in the
colony, was advocating separation from the
mother country.”
‘ THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLES."
Sir John Robertson recently shook hands with an American. The English-
speaking peoples are not now going “hand in hand " quite as much as
formerly.
A Melbourne barrister from the North of
Ireland, who has a peculiar accent and pronuncia-
tion, while addressing a jury last week, spoke of
one of the witnesses as “ a sneak in the grass.”
About 11,000 execrable puns have been
forwarded to us regarding the amputation of one
of the legs of the Ameer. “ A mere trifle,” “ a
meer acle if he recovers,” and so on. When
written on good paper jokes of this kind fetch
about three-halfpence a pound for wrapping up
matters of inconsiderable value.
Madame Hazard, late of Melbourne,
whose present address is somewhere in the next :
world, is said to have made a will last year in
favour of Prior Butler, but his reverence reproved
her for her naughty habit of preferring champagne
to tea, and so the will was altered in favour of the
grocer's boy.

New South Wales at the Colonial and Indian
Exhibition w r s thoroughly jepresentative and, Gold Ores
and Qu .rtz attracted great attention, especially when it was
known that the average ter ton was far in exesss of that in
the other colonies. Later news has shown that New South
Wales is likely to beoome the “Gold Field of the future.”
Mr Freeman, the inventor of the Original and only Genuine
Chlorodyne, has lately sent out many cases with those gentle
men who are interested in the auriferous enterprise. Mr.
Freeman has received numerous flittering letters and visits
from New South Wales colonists who, one and all, speak
of the incalculable value of his Colorodyne in the treatment
of all the commoner diseases of life, and especially in Cramp,
Colic, Diarrhoea, Dysentery and Fevers so frequently met
with in the Gold and Diamond Fields of Australia.—Sold
everywhere throughout the Colonies. Insist upon having
“Freeman's” only. Reject substitutes, as they are worth-
less. Trade mark an Elephant.*
According to atatistics in Germany the
consumption of beer amounts to 20 gallons per
head ;in England to 30 gallons per head. The
grand old mother land can still aftbrd to guffaw.
She can produce bigger heads than any of them.
This little jeu de Mere will go around lonesome
till one of the boys gets hold of it,
A demented, half-starved, half-naked,
black gin, who has just been released from Casino
(N.S.W.) gaol where she was sent for protection,
has been turned loose to die in the bush. If some
of those charitable traffickers of the so-called
Queen’s Fund would waste a little sympathy and
cash, there is a P.M. up that way who will see
to it.
A small black boy was brought into Bris-
bane from the very far back-counti y. After a
stay of a week or two he went back to his native
land with his master. Then he started to tell the
blacks what he had seen. And what do you think
was the most surprising thing he had to tell them?
He skipped the railways, he passed over the sea,
he didn’t mention the ships, he said nothing about
the big city. He started his narrative by saying,
“ Down there that fella horse live in a house,’
moaning that the horses were kept in a stable.
This statement was received with derision. “If
that fella horse live in house does he sleep in bed
and eat off table, all same white man?’’ They
wouldn't have it at any price, and afterwards
when Punch (the blackboy’s name) went on to tell
them about the other things he had seen they
turned the cold ear of disbelief to his statements.’
They confided to the boss that “Ever since that fella
Punch go to Brisbane he all time jabber b
He. A prophet is not without honour, &c.
INTERESTING DISCOVERY.
On the banks of the river Merimac, 20 miles
from the Isle of St. Louis, a number of barrels
have been found buried in stone tombsand arranged
in systematical order. It is computed that they
have lain there for centuries, An inscription in
the Latin tongue was upon each barrel, viz:.,
“ Bonum beerum St. Louis non facit inebriensis ”
When the barrels were opened they were found
to contain St. Louis Lager Beer in a complete state
1 of preservation. Athenseus mentions the existence
of this beer in his “Deipaosophists, or Banquet
of the Learned,” and Bavins and Maosvius also
testify to its beneficial properties. Travellers
on the banks of the Upper Nile have found that
the Greeks had introduced the beverage in those
parts. With such ancient evidence it is not to be
wondered at that modern opinion endorses the
verdict. This famous St. Louis Larger Beer, I
! want every reader to understand, can be had at
I any Hotel in Australia
