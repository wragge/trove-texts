The Sentimental Bloke
I Everybody knows or ought to know The
Sentimental Bloke. He is the most typical
Australian that has ever mooched into Aus-
tralian literature. In C. J. Dennis’s Book-
block Ballads we had the pleasure of meet-
ing him; and now in The Songs of a Senti-
mental Bloke (Angus and Robertson,
Sydney. 3s. 6d.) we renew a treasured
acquaintanceship. As Henry Lawson says
in his enthusiastic foreword, The Senti-
mental Bloke is “more perfect than any
alleged ‘larrikin* or Bottle-O character I
ever attempted to sketch, not even except-
ing my own beloved Benno.” Well, we
should say that Benno and The Sentimental
Bloke, whose other name is Bill, are
cobbers.
Here we have the complete life-history of
The Sentimental Bloke and his Doreen. We
meet him first in “A Spring Song,” when
The young leaves is shootin' on the trees,
The air is like a long, cool sioig o' beer,
and Bill is yearning after his “ideel tart.”
Then we get “The Intro.” to Doreen, whom
Bill has made immortal.
’Er lurk
Wuß pastin' labels in a pickle joint.
A game that — any’ow that ain't the point.
And when Bill* “tried ter chat ’er in the
street,”
The way she tossed 'er 'eod an' swished 'er
skirt!
Oh, it tons dirt!
Poor Bill!
Me! that ’as barracked tarts, an' torked an'
larft,
An' chucked orf at ’em like a phonergraft!
Gorstrooth! I seemed to lose me poio'r o’
speech.
But, 'er! Oh, strike me pinkl She is a
peach !
The sweetest in the barrer! Spare me
days.
I cam't describe that diner’s toinnin’ ways.
The way she forks! ’Er lips! 'er eyes! 'Er
hair!. —
Oh, gimme airl
For :
... .Square an’ all, no matter ’ow yeh start,
The commin end of most of us is — Tart.
“I wisht yeh meant it, Bill,” sighs Doreen,
and speaks of higher things.
Yes, 'ighcr things—that wus the wap she
spoke;
An’ when she looked at me I sorter felt
That bosker feelin’ that comes o'er a bloke,
An’ makes ’im melt;
Makes 'im all ’ot to maul ’er, an’ to shove
'ls arms about ’er... .Bli’mef But it’s love!
But there are limits to Bill’s expression
of the poetry of young love.
The sparklin’ sea all sorter gold an ’ green;
An’ on the pier the band — O 'Ell Doreen!
All Bill can say is “O ’Ell Doreen!”
—and that is the real poetry of passion.
Whati more delicious tribute to her fascina-
tion could any Doreen want? “O 'Ell 1”
is the quintessence of desire, the precipitate
I of all the world’s poetry.
Bill takes her to the play, and there dis-
covers :
Wot’s in a namet Wot’s in a string o'
words t
They scraps in ole Verona wiv the'r swords,
A»’ ncvei' give a bloke a stray dog's chance,
An' that’s Romance. -
But when they deals it out wiv bricks an
boots
In Little Lon. they’re low, degraded broots.
Wot’s jist plain stoush wiv us, right 'ere
to-day,
Is “ valler ” if yer fur enough away.
Some time, some writer bloke toitt do the
trick
Wiv Ginger Mick,
Of Spadger's Lane. ’E’ll be a Romeo,
When 'e’s bin dead five ’undred years or so.
Already that prophecy has been fulfilled.
Ginger Mick, as we learn from recent reports
from Gallipoli, is fighting at the Front. His
“plain stoush,” when dealt out to the Turk,
is rewarded by the Victoria Cross for
“valler.”
And, after the unhappy episode of “The
Stror ’At Coot,” Doreen sings to her Senti-
mental Bloke, “beefin’ it out real good,” and
Bill’s heart melts. “You’ll ’ave to meet my
Mar, some day,” she says. And so he sees
it through. It was harder than he expected.
Mar called him “Willie”! Then the day
draws near. He is “hitched.”
“_4n'— wilt — yeh — take — this — woman — fer —
to be — „ ,
Yer — iceddid — wife?’’ ... .Oh, strike me!
Will I wot r
Take ’ert Doreenf 'E stan’s there arstm
me!
As if ’e thort per’aps Id rather not!
Take 'ert 'E seemed to think 'er kind was got
Like cigarette-cards, fer the arstin'.
Doreen, we feel, deserved her Bloke. For
when Bill stayed out all night,
< She never magged; she never said no word;
But sat an’ looked at me an’ never stirred —
I That 'urt look in 'er eyes, like some scared
bird
Sullenly Bill asks: “ ’Ow is a man to
gnard agen that look?” Wise Doreen brings
him no reproaches: she brings him beef tea!
Doreen will keep her Bloke.
Then comes the dramatic change in Bill’s
fortunes. He goes on the land. And then
“The Kid” arrives. When the nurse tells
Bill,
I drops into a chair, an’ jist see “ ’Ell!”
It teas a pray’r. I feels bofe crook an’
glad ....
An’ that’s the strength of bein’ made a dad.
But there ia more in it than that, as Bill
discovers later, when the kid gets a little
pain inside:—
I’m sent to talk tweet muffin' g to the fowls;
While nurse turns 'and-springt ew'ry time ’#
'owls.
So we leave the Sentimental Bloke, a success-
ful fruit-farmer, settled for life. a cheer-
ful but commonplace end for Bill. He still
remains sentimental; but in his last out-
pouring, “The Mooch o’ Life,” he becomes
almost sententious. Doubtless prosperity is
dangerous to poetry ipmd Bill must be get-
ting older. It is sad to see old Bill
Watchin', in the sundown of yer day,
Yerself again, grown nobler in yer son.
Somehow that doesn’t seem the same Bill;
he gets almost pious, “learnin* to fergive”;
still, he can “take the ’ole mad world as
’arf a joke”; and, after all,
Livin’ an * lovin’ —so life mooches on.
But if the Sentimental Bloke is married
and done for, his cobber remains—Ginger
Mick:—
'E ’awks the bunnies when ’• toils, does Miok.
And Ginger $lick, as readers of recent
issues of this journal know, has gone to the
war. He has all his adventures before him;
he has still to meet his Doreen. And, as
G. J. Dennis knows Ginger Mick as well as
he knows Bill, we shall doubtless welcome
Ginger Mick in another volume. We wish
him luck.
The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke is the
most typically Australian book published for
a decade. Its humor, its sentiment, its genu-
ine humanity, are expressed with feeling and
an assured poetic craftsmanship. C. J.
Dennis is not only an Australian poet: he
is a poet. The only flaws in his work are
his few lapses into the literary: throughout
Dennis’s absorption in the diction of Bill is
admirably sustained. Certainly the diction
and spelling will limit what should bs a
minor world-classic to the one continent
where the Australian language is understood;
but for the over-seas and the polite reader
there is the author’s delightful glossary.
“Bli’ me,” we learn, is “an oath with the
fangs drawn,” “strike” is “the innocuous
remnant of a hardy curse,” and “knock-
down” is “a ceremony insisted upon by ladies
who decline to be ‘picked up’!”
There must be many a Sentimental Bloke
and many a Ginger Mick at Gallipoli to
whom this volume, forwarded with the love
of their respective Doreens, will come
smelling of eucalyptus, or maybe, of Spad-
ger’s Lane. It is the most welcome bit of
Australia that can be exported to the home-
sick heroes at the Dardanelles.
The decorations, by Hal Gye, though a
daintily carried out piece of fantastic
humor, seem hardly necessary. Certainly
the Sentimental Bloke would not under-
stand th'eir meaning or their humor. Den-
nis needs no illustrations to such a delight-
ful piece of humor as “Pilot Cove,” which
almost insists on being quoted in full. In
these three stanzas we see the pilot core
more clearly than any artist could present
him: —
“Young friend,” 'e see....Young friend!
Well, spare me days!
Yeh’d think I t cus 'is own white-’eaded
boy —
The queer ole figure, wiv 'is gentle ways.
“Young friend,” 'e see, “/ wish't yeh bofe
great joy.”
The langwige that them parson blokes im-
ploy
Fair tickles me. The way 'e bleats *n’
brays!
“Young friend," 'e sez....
“Young friend,” 'e sez....A queer ole pilot
bloke,
Wiv silver 'air. The gentle way 'e dealt
Wit? 'er, the soft an’ kindly way 'e spoke
To my Doreen, 'ud make a statcher melt.
I tell yeh, square an’ all, I sorter felt
A kiddish kind o’ feelin’ like I’d choke....
“Young friend,” 'e sez
“Young friend,” ’e sez —on’ then me 'and *s
grips—
“I wish't yeh luclc, you an' yer lady fair.
Sweet maid.” An’ sofly wiv 'is finger-tips,
’E takes an’ strokes me diner's shinin’ ’air.
An’ when I seen 'er standin' blushin ’ there,
I turns an' kisses 'er, fair on the lips.
“Young friend!” ’e sez.
♦
“Masetto” objects to the musicalities of
Louis Stone’s Betty Wayside : “We are told
that the hero, the happy possessor of a
genuine ‘Duke’ —drops his beloved fiddle and
ia struck with horror at the idea of having
to have the back removed to allow of the
sound-post being righted again. Any ama-
teur knows a sound-post can be set quite
easily with an appliance for the purpose.
Then the heroine Betty, who plays divinely
on the piano, appears at a concert to per-
form a Beethoven concerto, and, after a
spasm of nervousness, ‘becomes. unconscious
of the audience, being intent on the need of
keeping in touch with the conductor’s beat.’
Did anyone ever see a solo performer play-
ing to the beat of a conductor? The execu-
tant always sets the tempo, and the con-
ductor indicate* for the purpose of keeping
the accompanying orchestra together. Then
the story informs the reader that the fair
pla/er does well, ‘and the orchestra
applauded in the traditional manner by tap-
ping their instruments with their bows.’
String-players don’t testify their apprecia-
tion that way. It is the music stand they
bit. Fancy striking the neck or scroll (the
least vulnerable part) of a violin with the
bow!”
A New Australian Novelist
This page apologises to Charles Garbage,
the adjudicator for Australia of Hodder and
Stoughton’s recent prize novel competition.
The Pioneers , by Katherine Susannah Prich-
ard ( per Dymock’s Library), is a splendid
Australian novel. It does not even remotely
resemble Garbage. This is the story of Aus-
tralia’s past, of the rough days of the early
settlement in Victoria,, of the birth-stain and
its removal. It.is F. McCubbin’s painting of
“The Pioneers,” in Victorian National Gal-
lery, set to fiction.
In the beginnings of free immigration to
Australia Donald Cameron and his young
wife take up a selection outback in Victoria.
Cameron is a stern, dour man, who prospers
by hard work, and ultimately finds himself
the richest man in the district—he who, in
Scotland, had labored just as hard “without
so much as a plot of sour earth as big as
y’r handkerchief to call my own.” Left
alone soon after her arrival on the selection,
his wife had befriended two convicts escaped
from the Island (Van Diemen’s Land) ; and
this act of sympathy influences the lives of
the Camerons and of the convicts and their
descendants. Stern, rough days those first
days were, with adventure and villainy and
heroism in plenty. Thad McNab followed the
simple profession of blackmailing. He it was
who received escaped convicts and helped
them to their freedom, to reap his reward,
when they had become prosperous, by taking
toll of their riches under threat of the ex-
posure of their past to the police. This prac-
tice of villainy he occasionally varied by
pretending to shelter the convicts and then
denouncing them to the police for the rewards
offered. The consequence was that McNab,
though hated, was feared by the whole of
the inhabitants of Wirreeford, for he had it
in his power at any moment to have them
transported back to Port Arthur.
The feud between the dour Donald
Cameron and the cunning Thad McNab is
the motive of an interesting and well-
worked-out plot. Thad gets hold of young
David Cameron, smarting under his father’s
harsh treatment of him, and the boy runs
away from home and gets mixed up in cattle-
duffing. And at the end Thad McNab gets
his revenge, and though David and the girl
he loves ultimately escape-his clutches, the
•nd for several of the characters is deepest
tragedy.
Of Dierdte, the daughter of one of the
escaped convicts, a lovable and gentle man,
all that need be said is that she is a courageous
and delightful heroine. But the story is no
mere love-story. It is a broad envisagement
of a fine and sturdy epoch of our early days.
The character drawing throughout is genuine
and honest. These people live. And the
Australian environment is capably but unob-
trusively indicated, treated -as a background
for the passions and bravery of the charac-
ters, without ever encroaching upon the
action, and without purple passages.
The author’s style is sincere and workman-
like. She tells her story straightly; and she
just sufficiently indicates the necessary
psychology of her varied characters in what
is, after all, a novel of incident. But there
Is no piling up of improbabilities; her plot
is firmly based and its development un-
hurried. Though no work of genius, The
Pioneers is a genuine piece of our early his-
tory, with its moral in the person of the
young lad who is the son of David and
Dierdre. Mrs. Cameron had already had a
vision of that fulfilment of her* son’s love for
Dierdre:—■
“They had set tt seed in the country that
would bear fruit in the union of the two. All
the labor of their pioneering had not been
in vain. Donald Cameron had done what he
set out to do, though his last days had been
darkened with disappointment, the bitter
sense of disgrace and the futility of all the
long years of toll. But his name would go
on, she realised, and his children’s children
would talk with pride of their grandfather
who had come from the old country, a poor
man, and had made a great name for himself
in' the new land....
“ ‘O God,’ she whispered breathlessly, ‘we
broke the earth, we sowed the seed. Let
theirs be the harvest —the joy of life and the
fullness thereof.’ ”
And when the young lad’s time comes to
carry on the work, his grandmother tells
him: “You ought to be a great man, Dan,
because four nations have gone to the mak-
ing of you. Your four grandparents were
English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh. They
have quarrelled and fought among them-
selves, but you are a gathering of them in
a new country. There will be a great future
for the nation that comes of you and the
boys and girls like you. It will be a nation
of pioneers, with all the adventurous, toil-
ing strain of the men and women who came
over the sea and conquered the wilderness.
You belong to the hunted, too, and suffering
has taught you They may talk about
your birth-stain by and bye, but that will
not trouble you, because it was not this
country made the stain. This country has
been the redeemer and blotted out all those
old stains.”
William J. Locke
William J. Locke repeats his popular
prescription in Jaffery (Lane, per Dy mock’s
Library). -What sort of a book is Jaffery?
“It is a modern high romance of love and
pity, of tears iridescent with laughter, of
strong and beautiful erring souls; it is at
once poignant and tender; it vibrates with
drama; it is instinct with calm and kindly
wisdom.” No; it is not that kind of book;
that is the book that one of the characters in
Jaffery writes, and naturally it is univer-
sally hailed as a work of- genius, and, in
consequence, becomes a best-seller. So often
a work of genius immediately becomes a
best-seller, doesn’t it? According to William
J. Locke, the public has the critical faculty
of instantly spotting works of genius; though
in his own case, and that of writers like
Hardy, Henry James and Meredith, despite
the perspicacity of the critics, it took the
public some time before it was aware of their
genius.
Is Jaffery this sort of book? “This vivid,
virile opening!.... The people are lustily
drawn. They have a flavor of the sea and
the breeziness of wide spaces; a deep-lunged
folk From the first it goes with a rare
swing, incident following incident, every trait
of character presented objectively in fine
scorn of analysis. There are little pen-
pictures of grim scenes faultless in their
definition and restraint. There is a girl in
it... .etc.” No; it is not that sort of book.
That is another book that another character
in Jaffery writes—also immediately popular,
also an obvious work of genius. Two master-
pieces in literature flung at us in one novel
by prodigal William J. Locke!
No, made confident by his assured popu-
larity, this clever writer gives us not one
Beloved Vagabond, but two—and marries
them. The absurd improbabilities of his
plot, involving murders, the theft of the
manuscript of a literary masterpiece, won-
derful adventures on board a tramp steamer,
and a fraud worked upon the wife of an
author that could only be possible were she
an imbecile, are handed out to his readers
with the assurance of a novelist who knows
just how much his public will accept. There
is, for instance, one scene in the hold of a
tramp steamer where in a gale the cargo has
shifted, and unless it is made secure the
vessel will be lost. Of course, the two
“Beloved Vagabonds” have shipped on this
tramp, the male as a deck-hand, though he
is a rich war-correspondent, and the female
as cook’s assistant. Of course, they aren’t
married yet—that would be too dull. And
naturally when.the male “Beloved Vaga-
bond” is ordered with the other hands to
descend into that awful hold of slithering
cargo—“twenty men in semi-darkness, scarce
able to stand, fighting blind, mad forces of
half a ton each” —the female Vagabond
descends, too —into that “helpless scuttering
surge of men and vast wooden cubes.”
“Most of the men had torn off their upper
garments and fought half-naked.... Soon the
heat became unbearable, and I, too, tore off
jersey and shirt. Liosha (the female Vaga-
bond) joined me, and we worked together
without speaking. (She was, of course,
dressed as a deck-hand.) Her long, thick
hair had come down, and she had hastily
tied it in a knot, just as you might tie a
knot in a towel, and she had thrown
off things like everybody else, and only a
flimsy cotton, sleeveless bodice, or whatever
it’s called, drenched through and sticking to
her, made a pretence of covering her from
her waist.”
Those are the delicate details that William
J. Locke insists upon when he is dealing
with titanic forces. Jack London could have
made his readers see such a scene. Con-
rad would have made his readers feel it.
Locke merely utilises it as a background for
his readers’ sentimental interest.
A delightful and fantastic tale, too agree-
ably written for criticism. Each character
is merely labelled by a few crude traits; and
the psychology of the two heroines is help-
lessly vague. Doria is either an idiot or a
nice girl; and Liosha’s love-affairs are frankly
incredible. But as long as Locke provides
us with plenty of excitement, tinged with
sufficient sentiment, and can continue to
furbish up new variants of The Beloved
Vagabond, Locke’s enormous public will not
mind. And, after all, Locke writes delight-
fully ; there is little that is slovenly in his
style. But, this novel is no “modern high
romance of love and pity”; there is no “trait
of character presented objectively in fine
scorn of analysis”; there are no “little pen-
pictures of grim scenes faultless in their
definition and restraint,”
“The object of this volume,” says W.
Gordon Henderson, in his foreword to
Foiled / The Enemy in our own Land
(Australasian News Oo. O.A. Is.), “is to
convey to the average citizen, in narrative
form, some Idea of the system on which the
Kaiser’s spies work.” And he asserts that
to-day the German Secret Service System
is as well organised as ever it was in Aus-
tralia. If this be so, then W. Gordon Hen-
derson has chosen the wrong way to warn
us of our grave danger. His palpably sen-
sational detective-yarn of a noble Sydney
detective foiling the German villain again
and again, with all the devilish ingenuity of
The Man Who Stayed at Home, at once
discredits the seriousness of his foreword.
Detective stories of this class are hardly
likely to “put us on our guard against the
Secret Service agent” in our midst.

Self-Loading Shotgun, 12 Gauge
The Winchester Model 1911 Self-Loader is a wild-fowl gun par excellence. The
recoil ejects the fired shell, feeds a loaded shell from the magazine into the
chamber, cocks the hammer and leaves the gun ready to be fired again. In wild-
fowl shooting, the game often comes fast and when least expected. Shoot a
Winchester Self-Loader and you can always be prepared for a series of shots; for
the loading and firing of this gun are controlled by the trigger finger. As the re-
coil of this gun is used to operate the reloading mechanism, the “kick” of heavy
loads is minimized, making the gun very pleasant to shoot. It is a hammerless,
two-part, take-down, five-shot repeater, that works well with all standard loads.
The working parts being made of Nickel steel, make it strong and safe.
Ask your dealer to show you the Winchester that’s

Attila
right
He wouldn’t give his liver a
chance. And now see how pos-
terity treats his name.
It wasn’t his liver’s fault. It
was his fault for neglecting it.
Like your liver, it was trying
always to get the poisons, of
gloom and vindictiveness out of
his blood, trying to make him
sunny and sweet - tempered,
kind v and considerate. The
wonderful, persevering, well-
intentioned chemistry of his
liver was just the same as
yours, but it never was helped
to do its work. Be warned!
Gentle help at the right time—
gentle, not drastic—is all your
liver needs. And many years
of experience and comparison
have proved that the gentlest,
friendliest, most appreciated
help you can give it is to take
now and then, before your
liver is in serious trouble.

RHEUMATISM
Its Cause—and Cure.
Rheumatism is caused by a curious,
poisonous acid in the blood. This acid, just
like tiny pieces of broken glass with rough
edges, settles in the joints and muscles and
causes that awful agonising pain of back-
ache, rheumatism and gout, gravel, and the
burning sensation of inflammation of the
bladder, etc. „
De Witt's Kidney and Bladder Pills
strengthen the kidneys and drive the
poisonous pain-causing acid right out of the
system.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid
of the cause —the poisonous uric acid.
Remember to do this a real remedy must
pass - through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you see the urine change to
a muddy bluish color—a feature which dis-
tinguishes De. Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills from all others —you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing-
touch on the right spot—the kidneys and
the bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to
the kidneys—that is why De Witt’s pills
give such amazingly quick relief—every
time. A permanent cure follows in almos't
every case. Look for that blue-colored urine.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
They will cure every one of the above
symptoms no matter how long or how badly
you have suffered.

The Lovers.
She jested at their youth ;
And, looking slily,
I saw the boy and girl
Love-making shyly.
The passing ferries went
In lighted splendor;
The sundered waters sighed
In whispers tender.
Soft was the wind’s caress ;
The engines, throbbing,
Blended in harmony
With music sobbing.
Absurdly coy was she,
And he ungainly.
We from our snug retreat
Could see them plainly.
Yet flashed within their eyes,
Like dawn’s bright breaking,
That great, surprising light
Of love awaking.
She jested at their youth....
But I, in sorrow,
Wished for a moment I
Their youth might borrow,
That I, .with heart uncloyed,
Could feel the tingle
Of warm blood beating high
When fingers mingle ;
Know the sweet frenzy of
Those first embraces,
The new-born ecstasy
That earth displaces;
Seeing no perjury
In red lips pouting;
Take love at simple worth.
Truth past all doubting!
She jested... .and I laughed,
Jesting at sorrow.
Would, for an hour of love,
Youth I could borrow!

Happy Valley.
I know a lovely valley that is open to the
South—
Lirl, come with me! Oh come with me!
, there’s magic in the place!
The City has its fingers on the corners of
your mouth;
And the mantle of the City makes a shadow
on your face!
The road down Happy Valley is like a
woman’s scarf;
It is pink within the hollow and pink upon
the rise!
Girl, come away ! Oh, come away ! —I want
to hear you laugh,
And I want to see the sunlight iu the won-
der of your eyes.
The air of Happy Valley holds a hundred
little tones :
The wind is off the ocean and there’s music
in its note,
And rinkle! rinkle! rinkle! runs the river
o’er the stones;
And I want to hear an echo from the glorv
of your throat.
The hills round Happy Valley are all dotted
o er with cows ;
And there are sheep upon them, here and
there a browsing horse;
And I want to see the fingers of the wind
upon your blouse,
And I want to hear the rustle of your skirt
amid the gorse.
The sky o’er Happy Valley is so very blue
and clear!
A lark is high within it, just a little trilling
speck!
And I want to take the melody and place it
to your ear,
And I want to see a sunbeam put an arm
about your neck.
The hunger of the City and the terror of the
noise !
Girl, come away! Oh. come away, and tread
the road with me,
The road down Happy Valley that goes
Winding ’mid its joys,
And we’ll follow and we’ll follow till we
find the open sea !

PATRIOTIC FUNDS AND THE LITTLE
AUSTRALIAN.
Twice daily a strong man staggers into The
Bulletin office beneath the weight of corres-
pondence urging an editor, distracted by
poets and a printer, to write at white heat
about (1) the necessity for the prompt
expenditure of all patriotic, relief and other
funds raised for the benefit of wounded and
sick soldiers and the dependents of those
who have been killed; and (2) the immedi-
ate adoption of 765 schemes for the special
benefit of the children of the fallen. And
when The Bulletin reflects on the possi-
bility of the number of men who have yet to
be killed and be wounded, and thinks of the
changes that often take place in the public
mind, and contemplates the probabilities
associated with national and private cash-
boxes, it finds itself with no very great
enthusiasm for any system of spending these
funds in which prudence is not given reason-
able weight. Certainly it is desirable to
have every legitimate call made upon the
funds promptly met; but it is equally unde-
sirable, in view of the special circumstances
and the uncertain liability, to regard the
funds as things to be got rid of as speedily
as possible. The progress of the war and
the frequent casualty list and the despatch of
more men to the Front suggest indeed that
it would not be inappropriate if the pumping
of money into these funds was considered as
of equal importance to the pumping of money
out. Therefore unless there is reasonable
evidence that the funds are not being dis-
tributed with a fair hand, without parsi-
mony, among those individuals for whose
succor they were established, The Bulletin
is not prepared to throw more than half a
dozen stones about, and it doesn’t think any-
body else ought to. There are two things in
particular tc recollect —that the war is still
in full blast, and that these funds differ
materially from those raised for the relief
of sufferers by a flood or a mine disaster or
a shipwreck. When floods subside or a
mine caves in or a steamer is collected by D.
Jones, the extent of the disaster and the
needs of the sufferers can be determined in
a day or two - . But if mines were blowing
up every day and floods took place seven
times a week, and the sea was snatching
ships away every evening, the situation
would be complicated, and that is just what
is happening now.
* * * *
So far as the children of the fallen are
concerned this paper has no doubt that one
of the most earnest wishes of the Austra-
lian people is that adequate provision shall
be made by the nation for bringing up the
fatherless youngsters. In a very special
sense they are the care of the Common-
wealth. But all children are the care of
the Commonwealth; and it seems to The
Bulletin that the multitudinous schemes it
has received, suggesting that the children of
dead soldiers should be regarded as of a
class apart, and given special privileges and
opportunities and medals and all that sort of
thing, represent a .waste of time. Selected
at random here is a scheme seriously ad-
vanced for adoption by the State: —
1. That the child of every fallen or wounded sol-
dier shall he given a certificate or medal, which shall
he held in trust by the schoolmaster. (It is explained
that exhibition of these things would have a fine
moral effect on all children.)
2. That the school teachers shall he directed to pay
special attention to the education of these youngsters
as a compensation for their loss.
3. That after leaving school the youngsters able to
produce medals or certificates shall have preference
of employment.
Such schemes are hysterical. To distin-
guish in public policy between the children
of a soldier who has fallen and of one who
has come back from the wars to hang up
his gun and get work would be ludicrous.
Treatment of the child of either of these
people differently from the youngster of the
citizen who had been prevented from getting
into khaki because of his flat feet or his
false tooth would be to clothe a Biblical
threat with unnecessary realism. And, any-
how, the children of Mrs. McWringer,
washerwoman, whose husband went West
in an atmosphere of mystery, have done no
harm. So, in lieu of playing about with
anaemic schemes of primogeniture in disguise,
suppose,the alternative be adapted of look-
ing on, the little Australian in the mass and
doing the best Australia is capable of, so
that he may have a fair chance? To The
Bulletin this seems the more enlightened
method; and by way of a start it moves
that the be adopted:—
That -the people of this Commonwealth direct
their multitudinous Parliaments to, —
(a) Knock off pawning the kid.
(b) Cut out of the last will and testament of the
nation that part which bequeaths the kid great
hunks of debt and p.n.
(c) Rescue the kid from the frequent slum, where
he is rendered physically and morally unfit.
( d ) Make the soil of Australia available to the
youth of Australia, so that the sons of soldiers,
wowsers, millionaires and politicians who charge a
fee for making patriotic speeches may have an equal
chance in something, at any rate.
(e) Turn down the foreign import and train the
Australian kid to manufacture the things his silly
old father has been dragging out of ships.
and pledge themselves to fire any or every Parlia-

The conspicuous merit about this is that
it indicates a series of steps which can be
taken at once without preliminary riot or
25 years’ wrangling by caucuses, Lib. or
Lab.; it represents a practical method of
doing the little Australian a good turn ; and
it shows a means by which the awful crowd
of parasites who are now loafing on the
youngster can be exterminated. Unless Aus-
tralia gets to work at this business of giving
the kid a fair deal, it looks as if one of the
first serious undertakings of the rising gen-
eration will be to erect a large monument on
which its opinion of the Old Man will be
chiselled in good, plain Australian. And
The Yell, which circulates morning and
evening editions in Gehenna, will contain a
full account of the proceedings, so that the
Old Man may be made aware of what his
children really think of him.
THE DELICATE ART OF LYING.
Those mighty lovers of truth, the Greeks,
who could not stamp the image of a monarch
on a coin without showing in relief the wart
upon his majestic nose, held that lying was
a fine art. Old Homer placed Ulysses,
the prince of deceivers, on a higher pedestal
even than Achilles, the tremendous fighting
leader of the Hellenic allies. The man who
could lie through to victory was a hero equally
with the man who by sheer strength and cour-
age could cut his way through with a sword.
The explanation is probably concealed in
the fact that the Greeks as a nation were
from earliest antiquity surrounded by power-
ful peoples infinitely lower in culture and
civilisation than themselves, and against
whom they could only maintain themselves
by long-sustained trickery and deceit. The
Greek sword was sharp, but the Greek hands
were few, and while the sword was never
found wanting at utmost need, the well-
framed lie was the shield and buckler of all
that was best and highest in the world.
Something of the same kind was true of
every rising race and people, and as a result
the modern world fought its way by slow
stages to light and truth, clinging to its faith
in lies with a passion of apology which is
the outstanding paradox of progress. Diplo-
macy, the art of international lying, is con-
doned and secretly admired, and the lesser
diplomacy of protective falsehood has been
allowed to find its way into every corner of
political, commercial and social life. In
the armory of truth the lie-is the readiest
weapon—not the strongest, not the surest,
but the lightest and most easily handled.
* * * *
In looking at the great world of nations
we are guided by colored maps and the
cabled remarks of those who hold the reins
of office, but we know nothing surely. The
very men who themselves handle the fine-
edged falsehoods most readily are so often
deceived that clever guesswork as to the
motives behind actions and >a sub-
conscious instinct for the likely thing are the
best that even keenest statesmen can achieve.
When the great Napoleon had run the full
gamut of diplomatic trickery and -was pre-
paring for his last campaign, his brilliant
brain evolved an idea so novel that its suc-
cess seemed certain. lie told the absolute
truth about his plans. One cold, strange
man in England who had watched him for
years with narrow eyes concentrated on a
single purpose literally believed him. The
result was Waterloo. Wellington’s amaz-
ing guess that truth was truth saved the
kings of Europe and made Freetrade, the
Kaiser and a number of other things pos-
sible. Napoleon’s one attempt to deceive
by plain dealing had failed; how could an
attempt to undeceive by similar means
succeed? Seasoned statesmen like Beacons-
field, Gladstone and Salisbury told the
truth hesitatingly, as if speaking lies, and
spoke the delicately-framed falsehood as if a
high sense of honor and responsibility had
forced them to get down to the bedrock of
plain fact. And so the game goes on ; and
Europe, clinging pathetically to its ancient
traditions, grants itself absolution for its
falsehoods that it may proceed to complicate
them with still more subtle prevarication.
* * * *
All this is very irritating to foolish per-
sons like ourselves who want to know things
for the mere sake of knowing them; but
diplomacy becomes maddening when it is
employed outside the international sphere and
invades the humbler chambers of our domes-
tic politics. It may be that Gladstone
cannot speak the truth about European
relations to Smith or Jones, lest Bismark
should overhear what he says, or lest Jones
should go and blurt it out to a pal who will
tell the Sultan of Turkey; but there seems
to be no good reason why Fisher and
Holman should hedge themselves with simi-
lar evasions and fortify themselves with pre-
varication and dark sayings when dealing
with plain matters affecting our own back-
yard and rubbish-tip. Yet if in the inter-
national sphere things are involved and diffi-
cult to understand, they are made a
thousandfold, more so in the ordinary realm
of home politics. We can be sure of
nothing. Our blind guess at the polls puts
this man or that in a position of national
trust, and whether he proves worthless or
shines at his job is almost as much a matter
of chance as the result of a horse race.
What every elector feels that he requires for
his guidance is to be present in his astral
body at one Cabinet meeting where, unseen,
he might watch and hear and form a definite
judgment with regard to the Ministers
present. But even if he possessed such
occult powers he would probably find that
the subtlety of diplomacy hides the real
motives and aims of those in office in their
place of council, and that to get at the bed-
rock truth he would require to be with the
knots of twos and threes who compose the
Cabinet in their still more secret private
conferences; and even then he might be
readily enough deceived. The Party Govern-
ment swindle is in large measure responsible
for the secrecy, caution and want of candor
which mark the path of the politician ; but it
is also in some degree a legacy from the past
and a reflection of the cunning obscurantism
which nations employ in their dealings with
others. To the small party politician the
party is the nation and its opponents are the
enemy; and the same forces which prevent
him from ever becoming a true patriot com-
pel the caucus-bound lawmakers to adopt a
secret diplomacy which wearies and disgusts
the public.
* * * *
The intense belief in the danger of speak-
ing the truth on the part of those in
authority has kept us in blindness during the
whole of the present war. We first learned
that Britain had joined in the struggle from
an American source, and since then the
crumbs of information officially thrown to
us have been of the meagre sort calculated
to give an entirely erroneous idea of the
nature of the fighting. Hundreds of times
we have heard of trenches recovered of the
previous loss of which we had no informa-
tion ; again and again we were told that all
was well, when later cables made it only
too clear that all had been ill. English
statesmen have spoken of the tremendous
gravity of the situation and have hinted at
disasters unthinkable at the very time when,
after the report of a series of minor victories
for our arms, we were assured that the
enemy was at his last ditch. The whole
thing has been confusing in the extreme; and
not one-tenth of the deception practised upon
us could be justified on the ground of public
safety. Of course, certain information was
rightly withheld through the fear that in
giving it publicity it might help the plans of
the enemy entrenched at Mosman and St.
Kilda, but the stories of the desperate cir-
cumstances of our troops in the early stages
of the war, of the defeats we suffered and
the reverses we sustained should not have
been withheld. In the main the censorship
has been a grim and foolish farce, calculated
to weaken our fighting arm and damp our
patriotic ardor. The people as a whole have
been treated by the few in authority as if
they were enemies and aliens, and the only
explanation which Can be given of the course
pursued is that it is in line with things done
in the past and in keeping with the devious
processes of diplomacy which statesmen love
and their small hirelings ape.
* * * *
The whole diplomatic idea belongs to an
order of things which is utterly foreign to
Australia. In this country we neither love
lies nor believe in their efficacy. We still
can admire Achilles ; we more and more
detest Ulysses. As for the half-information
about the war, which under the censorship
has become practically false information,
those who have been guilty of deceiving us
have already learned in part their folly.
They will yet come to know still more com-
pletely that they entirely and grossly misun-
derstood the Australian temper and character,
and that under the stimulus of the open
knowledge of defeat we should have done
more and done it more readily. It may be
our misfortune —and perhaps our sunshine is
responsible—but we refuse to fumble in
darkness while there is light available.
Devoted as we are to many pastimes, the
European game of Blindman’s Buff is not for
us. We refuse to have bandages over our
eyes, and the bandage-makers great and small
who take their cues from overseas will be
wise if they learn it in time. In a word,
Australia is about full up of lying, and a
number of people who practise it are going
to get kicked.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Need for a Spring Cleaning.
It would be as well for Commonwealth Minis-
ters, even if only for the sake of their own
political hides, to realise that an enormous
number of people in Australia are getting
mighty restless. The military machine is
creaking horribly. It has been running for 15
months now, and should by this time be
going without friction. Pearce, who is
standing behind the starting lever, professes
to be “greatly pleased” with things. If
this accurately represents the state of mind
he is in, the only possible commentary is
that he is wearing the wrong kind of spec-
tacles and is handicapped by not seeing the
things which come within the vision of the
average man. It would have been absurd
to expect an absence of muddle in this busi-
ness. But if things keep on as they are at
present, and unless the Government is able
to enforce a very marked improvement in the
details of administration, it will find the task
of convincing the electors that it is competent
to discharge the extended authorities asked
for by the Referenda, much more difficult
than would be the case in other Circum-
stances. It is no use being blind in that
eye; and this paper tells the Government
without hesitation that it has embarked upon
the campaign heavily burdened by the amaz-
ing ineptitude of military officialdom, con-
doned with sedulous persistence by Minis-
ters. The very dogs in the street are barking
about it. Even in such a simple matter as
the transport and landing of the wounded,
the Department still seems unable to bestir
itself to intelligent action. Only the other
day a contingent of wounded Sydney men
arrived in Port Jackson to find they could
not be put ashore because some official had
not been told they were coming, or some
individual was unable to arrange for a taxi-
cab. And so it happened that while
hundreds of the relatives and friends of these
men were waiting for them, they were kept
out in the harbor aboard the hospital ship
until next day, when the Department found
itself able to move. Then there has been
the case of wounded men coming back in a
hospital ship with dozens of empty cabins
and the men obliged to sleep in any old place.
And the medical inspection has been all up-
side down, and mobilisation orders have
been issued at random, and chaos rules in the
system of paying wives their allowances, and
so on and so forth, all irrespective of the
atrocious things that have taken place and
still are taking place in connection with the
camps. As for the financial side, everyone
who has a nose to smell by is firmly holding,
his breath. The public is very patient, up
to a point, and this paper is loth to use-
hard words at this '&tftge of the proceedings;
but the Ministry will be acting wisely if it
bends its collective back to the job of tidying
things up, for the certain alternative is that
something will go off bang.

The Beginning and Middle and End of It.
All this frantic argument as to whether
compulsory service for defence is Socialistic
in principle or anti-Sosh in intention, or is
connected by marriage or otherwise with
any particular formula in politics, is weari-
some. When a citizen is awakened in the
middle of the night in a burning house and
has the choice between being cremated and
reaching the street in ssec., the business on
hand demands that he shall ignore the
Police Offences Act and reach that street,
whether his pyjamas make the trip or not.
In the same spirit it would be a blessed
relief if these agitated controversialists,
would keep to the crux of the whole thing,
which is whether a nation can defend itself
most effectively, and with the greatest
economy of life and misery, when its man-
hood is ready for the job and appears with
its sleeves rolled up when the whistle-
blows, or, as an alternative, can it do lust
as well when a few men are ready and the-
rest are holding meetings to consider whether-
they ought to go round and see the shift;
boss? The problem hinges on the one point:
The Hearkener.

Preference to Partisans.
Andrew Fisher decorated the party joss
with a tasteful garland of straw the other
day. He was fobbing off a Sydney lntu
viewer who wanted to know something about
the High Goinmissionership :
A Labor Government is in power and we con-
sider it, right that a man representing the 1 uhlig
party should hold the position.
In other words, political partisanship is the
proper test of fitness for a post of high
responsibility in the service of the Mate.
Two excuses may be offered for his theory.
First the very raw one that a Government
ought to reward political services to the
party. This opens np beautiful possibili-
ties ‘ If it is right for the Government to
reward the political partisan, it must be also
right for the political partisan to give re-
wards for the same virtues. In other words,
the High Commissioner, being rewarded tor
being a Laborite, will be also doing the right
thing in rewarding those with whom he
comes in contact for being Labontes. in
the second place, the Government may otter
the excuse that a Labor man natiuaily
knows best how to interpret the wishes ot a
Labor Government. In that case, ot
course, the Labor Government will not do
its successor the injustice of appointing the
High Commissioner for any longer period
than it retains office itself. If it thinks it a
proper thing that Labor in office here should
be represented by Labor in office in London,
then it must concede that the Liberals have
an equal right to appoint a Liberal partisan
to represent them when they get back, as
they may some day. So we shall be unding
the Commissioner concerned not about hold-
ing Australia’s end up in London, but about
keeping his party in power and himself m
office. A more improper proceeding than
that cannot be conceived. What Australia
needs is the best man for the yob. It is
no more necessary that he should be of one
special brand of politics than that he should
be a Particular Baptist or a vegetarian. It
it is necessary that he should be a political
partisan, then it is equally necessary that
the holders of a thousand other offices in the
State should be partisans; and that would
introduce a system of corruption and a mass
of turmoil which even Andrew Fisher might
_not care to be responsible for. If Fisher
wants the job in London, well and good. But
for Heaven’s sake let him avoid the hypoensy
of pretending that he takes it in pursuance
of a political principle.

The Follies We Have Fed On.
The position of the Empire in regard to
national service, regulation of private profits
and many other important war-factors shows
how hard it is for a nation brought up m
the belief that it is inherently superior to
any other,- and in careless ind:" erence to
the ideals and customs of the rest of the
world, to reform itself in a hurry. British
“liberty to do as one likes,” British freedom
as compared with “Continental slavery,” the
ability of one Britisher to whip. four for-
eigners, with ancient silly old sayings about
one volunteer being equal to 10 pressed men,
and the quoting of England’s great wealth
as a proof that in everything she is supreme
—continual harping on these and kindred
strings has evolved dangerous characteristics
in the average Britisher. It is only fair to
say that in this he has been encouraged by
the bulk of those capable of swaying thought.
Politicians, the press, novelists, magazine
writers, educated people for the most part
have done their best to foster the concep-
tion. No better method of blocking the
acceptance of any scheme to better the status
of the nation or the individual could be found
than to label it “Continental.” Despite the
wonderful results achieved by German
“socialistic” legislation in peace as well as
in war, the Britisher has consistently sneered
at such things and refused to see the neces-
sity for a large nation in a small land having
more regulation than a few stray black*-
fellows in a continent. When the war
broke out, the average Britisher, still tilled
with this sense of superiority, naturally sat
back and waited to hear of the downfall 1 f
the big German army when attacked by the
small British Expeditionary Force. Since
then, little by little, and in spite of strenu-
ous endeavors on the part of the authorities,
the truth has been slowly dawning, and it
is now realised by a large number of badly-
disillusioned people that, after all, when it
comes -to war we are not magically pre-
eminent. Brave our men are; but their
opponents are also brave. Ours hang like
glue to their positions; but so do their
opponents. In every way our men sacrifice
themselves for their country and their man-
hood’s pride; but so does the enemy. The
enemy couldn’t stand the bayonet, it was
printed, and ran from it every time; but so
far his running hasn’t moved bis lines
much backwards. The poor old Turk—
what was he to stand in the road of the
Allies? But he still stands there. The
big warship meets the little warship, and the
little warship sinks, whether she flies the
Union Jack or the German emblem. And
so ok Irresistibly the painful truth has
been borne home, that to win we must not
trust to ideas of an illusory superiority, but
that victory depends on men and guns and
munitions and organisation and science and
self-sacrifice. And now the primary trouble
is to make a people, taught for years that
disorganisation and haphazardness and indi-
vidualism constitute the higher policy, behove
in a few minutes that organisation and thor-
oughness and Socialism are necessary and
right. ' Can it be’ done? And if not, what
will the harvest be? These are the questions
of the hour, and the hour is perilously late.
The Soldier and a Scheme to Get Some
Unearned Increment.
Thebe are indications of a sudden anxiety to
embark on schemes of land purchase for the
benefit, so it is said, of the men who carried
a gun. That land settlement should be pro-
moted cannot be questioned; but that it
should be done upon the lines proposed is to
confess the failure of past land policy. At
present events go something like this: Cer-
tain persons become possessed of the earth;
the State borrows and spends millions on
the construction of railways and roads and
bridges, thus giving improved, access to vari-
ous parts of the aforesaid earth; the
improved access gives to the earth there-
abouts an added value. Land that was
worth a pound or two per acre is quadrupled
in value by the State’s loan expenditure.
Then the State, coining to the conclusion that
the number of owners of earth should be
increased, rushes in and buys pieces of earth
from the persons seated thereon, paying
them heavy compensation. Thus the public
borrows £5 to improve the value of Smith’s
land. Having improved the value by £5,
it next buys Smith out, borrowing another
£5 to do it. It now attempts to sell the land
to Jones, who has to pay the £5 which the
State paid Smith, and also the interest on
the £5 the State borrowed originally, plus
various charges and etceteras. Every trans-
action of this kind makes the next one
more difficult, increases the drain of interest,
and in nine cases out of ten creates a class
of people who, finding it impossible to pull
through, have to be spoon-fed by the general
taxpayer; and he frequently dips deeper into
the loan bowl for the purpose. Of course,
besides being all grossly unfair, it can lead
to nowhere but disaster. If the argument is
that the soldier deserves a farm, the answer
is that there is- no special reason why he
deserves a farm any more than a suburban
grocery or a tanyard. Let him have his
reward, -by all means; but in dealing with
the lands' of Australia let us not hang, a
heavy debt round his neck, and a heavier
debt round the necks of future generations,
while leaving them both to struggle with the
real land problem —the problem, of unearned
increment —which their fathers industriously
shirked.
The Prevailing Dust Storm Behind the
Trenches.
Opponents of compulsory service against
armed aggression were busy all last month
explaining (1) that they were opposed to
compulsion; (2) that they were not opposed
to it if there was also compulsory conscrip-
tion of wealth. This means, if it means
anything, that they are only opposed to
compulsion when there is not enough ot it.
Provided they have compulsion in large
hunks their dislike of the same. thing in rela-
tively small quantities will disappear. All
of which is about as reasonable an attitude
to take up as that of the citizen who objected
to public authority compelling him to connect
his drain with a sewerage system before the
brotherhood of man had arrived. I he
problem that is up for consideration now is
not the readjustment of the whole social and
economic system, but the ways and means
with the material on hand, and the processes
that can be immediately invoked, of throwing
off an enemy who is clutching at the national
windpipe. Men are being killed in thousands,
the world filled with woe and misery without
parallel, the very existence of nations threat-
ened by a tiger which sprang upon them in
the dark. To let the brute claw and tear
eivili-ation to pieces while the people he
wants to swallow are debating whether they
will agree to socialisation of national
resources argues a preference for disputation
over life. - As the phrase is being used now
in the middle of terrible conflict in which
the only thing that counts is brute force,
“conscription of wealth” is a mere, catch-
cry, and the people who are using it most
frequently in Australia know that it is so.
For all practical purposes conscription of
wealth is with us. Any day the Govern-
ment can call upon the people of Australia
for any sum it may require. It is even now
calling on them for as much as 6s. m the ±
of their income. It is demanding of them up
to about one-third of the wealth of which
they die possessed. Its powers in this direc-
tion are illimitable. But to wrangle about
whether this is so or not—to engage in
heated debate about whether the fetate
should or could adopt a particular system ot
finance, and how it is all going to be done
and all the rest of it—and to do all this
while an international burglar and garrotter
is struggling to settle the proposition with, a
Jack Johnson, is merely an evasion of social
responsibility. Social theories can be experi-
mented with, submitted to tests, amended in
the light of experience. But when a homi-
cide comes along with a bayonet the theorist
can only conclude that the first thing to do
is to sit on the maniac’s head ; for unless the
theorist gets there first he won’t have any
theories left to trouble about afterwards.
The Occasional Wastefulness of
“Economy.”
The argument used to be that John Bull
could not afford to adopt a scheme
oc universal military training; that the
cost, a few millions a year, would
lead to beggary; that if the nation
sanctioned any such departure from
British precedent it would certainly become
involved in war through a Foreign Minister,
made truculent by the strength behind him,
speaking disrespectfully to another foreign
Minister or a Crowned'Head. Therefore, ran
the conclusion from the argument, considera-
tions of economy, and the preservation of
peace called for nothing more expensive or
provocative than an army strong enough to
repel any enemy who might suddenly descend
on Muddleton-by-.the-Mud. It was a beautiful
theory with three large holes in it: (1) that
a war forced upon a nation with an army
inadequate for immediate action would lead
to colossal expenditure; (2) that the absence
of ail adequate army was a direct incentn
to a possible enemy to unifee war; ami v>J
that Muddleton-in-the-Mud need not neces-
sarily be attacked to cause national trouble.
It was because the German saw there. -was no
armed Britain ready to spring on him unit
he himself sprang at Belgium, who had prac-
tically disarmed herself. It was because
John had been afraid to find a moderate
amount of cash every year that he had no
effective force, and has now, in order to get
an army, to foot a bill of staggering size,
in which one day’s expenditure dissipates a
year’s false economies. The leap in the
spending has been like -this :
1913 .. ~ £197,492,969
1914 . , 660,473,533
1915 '. . . 1,590,000,000
1916 (estimate) 1,825,000,00-0
To these later figures must lie added the
enormous reduction of earnings and an ap-
palling, loss of life,, though we have only just
begun to do what would have been done in
the first days of. war had an effective army
been instantly available. There is little com-
fort in all this for the people who foretold
what must happen ; but the dreadful conse-
quences of sloth and slackness and devotion
to old shibboleths are sharp reminders to the
rest of the world that, though unreadiness
to repel aggression may be cheap enough for
a time, it is a mighty expensive thing in the
end.

The Murders in Armenia.
The Armenian horror, which is only begin-
ning to be known in all its frightfulness,
seems to eclipse everything else when mea-
sured by the actual number of gallons of
blood shed. Eight hundred thousand men,
women and children have, it is said, been
slaughtered since May. While the German,
by backing the Unspeakable and leaving
immense territories entirely at his mercy, is
directly responsible, the real trouble goes
back much further, and England has to take
her share of the burden of shame. Things
happened somewhat in this fashion. When
Russia had smashed the Turks and mopped
up the mess they had made in Bulgaria,
England stepped in and balked the victors
of their reward. The Bear retired growling,
and England propped up the Turk with
financial pillows and told him to be good.
He wasn’t good ; and before many years had
gone he was killing Armenians in bulk with
greater enthusiasm than he had ever killed
Bulgarians. It was then England’s move.
Russia had fought one hard war to suppress
massacres by Turks, and, as England had
interfered, the job of settling the Armenian
difficulty devolved upon her. If at that
time Salisbury had taken the Ottoman
Empire by the slack of its pants and hurled
it out on its ear for good, the feat would
have had the solid applause of all Europe.
But England funked, did nothing, and the
Turk gathered the general no'Ay- that he was
licensed to murder in Asia as long as he kept
his knife out of anything European. how
the Unspeakable has found an ally of like
tastes, who has loaded his gun and sharpened
his axe for him, and he is putting up a great
fight at one end of his dominions while he
is slaughtering whole villages of peaceful
citizens at the other. And until the Turk is
pushed right out of Europe nothing can be
done about it. The U.S.A. have said, or
are going to say, to the Turk that if he
doesn’t stop Woodrow Wilson will be quite
cross with him; but Achmit and Abudul
and Ibrahim and people like that don’t know
Woodrow from a bar of soap, which; consid-
ering the permanent soap famine in the
Turkish bath-tub, is saying a good deal.
Armageddon.
The declaration of the Germans that the
present Balkan mix-up is uue to their deter-
mination to snatch Egypt from our hands
recalls ancient prophecy. Although the state-
ments of the prophet people, as reported to
us, are a trifle vague and hazy, and couched
in language which might mean one thing it
stood on its head and another if looked at
sideways, there seems to be a general con-
sensus of opinion among those who have
examined them from every possible angle
that the Armageddon of the nations, long
foreshadowed, is to be fought somewhere in
the narrow plain between Galilee and the
ancient Samaria, with special trimmings in
the way of great cavalry charges and the
leading of forlorn hopes on the slopes of
Mount Carmel. The real interest of the
thing lies, of course, in the fact that if the
Germans forced their way overland through
Asia Minor it is at this very point that the
Allies might be expected to make their great
stand for the defence of Egypt. Egyptian
Pharaohs in ancient times again and again
brought their hosts to this point to defend
their land from northern attacks. Like wise
strategists they fought the foe as far from
their own borders as possible, and even when
they were forced to retire southward it was
a very tired and dejectdd pursuer who at
last came to the desert frontier of then-
realm. In point of fact, for several thou-
sands of years no invasion of Egyptian terri-
tory was' successful. The German has no
less tough a job in front of him if he intends
to pass that way now ; and as the prophets
have it that in the last great battle good is
to wallop evil to a dead finish, the outlook
is bad for the Kaiser. Before the curtain
rings down, Peace is also to last for a thou-
sand years, which is good hearing for those
who oppose conscription, but no safe basis
on which to make our defence arrangements.
In any case, the prophets were notoriously
weak in geography, and those who interpret
them would be better engaged in growing
potatoes.

Thus George Reid, talking at the London
Guild Hall: —
In Australia there was not an individual black,
white or tan — who did not. swear by Kitchener.
And George wants to represent White Aus-
tralia to the end of the war on a screw of
nothing a week! Observe, first, the order
of the colors—the black first, the mere -white
in the middle, then the tan—the lofty Asiatic
occupying the position of rhetorical em-
phasis at the end of the phrase. What a
cheerful view of our Commonwealth some of
George Reid’s hearers must have taken
home from the Guild Hall! The average
Englishman was long in the habit of think-
ing of this continent as a piebald place unfit
for the habitation of decent white people,
and it was mostly to correct that erroneous
view that people like G. Reid were appointed
to eat dinners, and make speeches m London.
Evidently the person with the eyeglass tor-
gets. In his earlier days cheap nigger went
hand in hand with the Freetrade he loved,
and now in his befatted age he imagines that
he really was sent away to represent a coun-
try as cursed with variety of color as ms
own policy would have made it. Rut Ins
policy failed ; the White Australia dream is
being realised, and all that is left for the
survivors of the anti-Australian party to
do is to sit in a corner and dream of the
mongrels that we might have been. But we
do wish they would be quiet in their sleep.

“R.R.”; While the exportation of Austra-
lians continues a cable states that 200 Eng-
lish immigrants are on the way from England
in one ship for Australia. We are exceed-
ingly English in this matter. The call of
the new countries sent the best of the British
out to South Africa, Canada, Australia and
the U.S., where they promptly became South
Africans, Canadians, Australians and repub-
licans of America. England, with its rotten
Freetrade notions, forced on a foolish people
by a few exploiters of cheap labor, promptly
filled their places with Russian .Jews, Ger-
mans, Hungarians and Polaks. Now we are
sending out our best and bringing in the bad
citizens who run away from England when it
is at death grips. But England was never
as foolish as Australia. When it lost the
best and replaced them with perilously near
the worst, it did not pay the fares or portion
of the fares of its immigrants, and we do.
No Australian State should spend another
copper in bringing in these undesirables; for
the man who leaves his country in fear of
conscription in time of war is a deserter in
face of the enemy. And these are many.
Here in my little Melbourne suburb there
were three Australians working as trades-
men’s carters—mere lads. They have gone
to the war, and their places have been
filled by three men from England, men of
from 25 to 30, dull as oxen, but not so dull
that they didn’t know enough to make for
the best place on earth. It is fine encour-
agement to recruiting, this spectacle of the
runaway Englishman calling the Australians
“fools” because they take up the job he
deserts. But the real fault is with the
British Government, which does not immedi-
ately enact conscription and prevent the
emigration of these eligible men.

In the United States it is now usual to
find the hotels of- remote villages built to
10 and 12 storeys, in imitation of the
awful structures of New York and
Chicago. A building which might have
spread over an acre of otherwise useless
ground is set up absurdly on end for no
decent reason, and its builders describe the
monstrosity as progress. Sydney sins in a
somewhat similar fashion. It is true that
the space in George-street, Pitt-street and a
few other localities is valuaole. but there is
surely plenty of room for the business area
to extend without invading the top storeys
of the atmosphere. Having regard to the
fact that the streets nearest to the centre
are so narrow and badly shaped that they
must at some time be re-Constructed, the
piling up of mountains of brick and stone is
specially absurd. Alfred Deakin brought
back the advice from America that nobody
should erect buildings intended to last more
than 50 years. The experience there has
been that all growing and expanding towns
are re-built within that period to meet new
conditions and new needs. Long before 50
years are over N. S. Wales will either have
fallen dead through an overdose of crude
HoLMAN-ism, or some big, sane person will
have taken a mattock and opened the closed
ports of the North and South. In either
case, skyscrapers in Sydney will be ridi-
culous. The broad, far-spreading building of
few storeys, with wide, open rectangles in
the middle for light and air, is the sort of
thing that suits our climate and conditions.
As for the idea that people will only do
business within the toss of a chocolate cream
of the main post office or the central
railway station or the ferry-boat land-
ing, or some other picked spot, the futility of
such an argument has been proved again and
again. If a shop large enough and good
enough to attract the best custom were
erected to-morrow in Woolloomooloo it would
draw fashion and beauty to its counters. In
fact, one or two big business concerns have
gone even further from the centre, and are
steadily drawing the crowds after them. The
notion that all the city should be hoisted in
lifts is elevating only to some insane pride
in novelty at the expense of common-sense
and mechanics and economics and every
other blessed thing that really counts.
The cutting off of the Saturday afternoon
delivery adds intensity to the long week-end
sleep in which the Post Office indulges.
From midday on Saturday until the follow-
ing Monday all postal and telegraphic con-
veniences practically cease to exist, and
things become as if Rowland Hill had
never lived. The carrying of letters which
have been prepaid is such a happy-go-lucky
business anyhow that a day or two lost
entirely out of the calendar could make
little difference; but the long tele-
graphic sleep is a nuisance. It is true, of
course, that some central offices are open for
the despatch of wires, but unless sent to
other central offices there is nobody at the
distant end to receive them, and so
the apparent benefit is a delusion. Yet
with all its “economies” and disregard for
the needs of the public, who may urgently
want a doctor, a five-pound note or some-
thing that only a telegram can swiftly pro-
- cure, the service does not pay its way and
is a burden upon the general revenue. What
is wanted is not less j efficiency but more;
not a cutting down of conveniences, but
additions to theni. To obtain these things
a Postmaster-General who doesn't care a
hang about votes should be . appointed—not
a mere figurehead, but a live man with an
axe. He will have some heavy chopping to
do before he gets through, but his bush work
will be worth while. Observe the sad, heart-
broken fashion in which the average postal
official sells you a penny stamp, and you
will understand at once where the lack of
economy lies.

The Fight that is Not a Picnic.
Of course, it looks very grey, and the end
is far off; but, after all, it never looked par-
ticularly cheerful, and the present urgent
call for more men would have been made
long ago had it not been for the fatuous con-
spiracy to bandage the eyes of the nation
against the light of truth—a conspiracy of
which, by the way, Tiie Bulletin has had
some further experience during the week. All
the talk on which the Empire has been re-
galed about the enemy weakening, and shoot-
ing his bolt, and starving, and being in the
midst of a financial crisis, and all the rest
of it has been just so much humbug. He
hasn’t weakened. On the contrary, after a
year of war he was able to strike more
heavily than at the beginning, and is now
embarking upon a fresh enterprise of great
magnitude. With the Bulgar helping him,
and the Greek and the Roumanian standing
by as spectators of Servian martyrdom, it is
not at all improbable that the enemy will
soon be astride of Europe from the North
Sea to the Bosphorus. In a sense, this
movement is an indication that Germany
recognises failure in the West. But it is
one which involves special perils for
Britain, and is only made possible by very
pronounced success in the field against
Russia, and by exceptional cunning or pre-
varication in what passes for diplomacy. On
the broad facts as they stand to-day, it looks
suspiciously as if the Allies had been fooled
in the Balkans with great success—a circum-
stance contributed to in a very great degree
by the unimpressive character of the cam-
paign against the Dardanelles. The failure
of leadership exhibited there has only been
partly redeemed by the magnificent bravery
of the soldiery. Had the Allies spent more
time in considering themselves than in talk-
ing about the German, and had they, instead
of habitually under-rating the enemy, struck
the Turk with quadrupled force, they should
have been at Constantinople months ago, and
the Balkan armies would now be looking the
other way. But it would be as absurd to get
cold feet now as it was idiotic at the begin-
ning to anticipate victory except at the end
of an exhausting struggle. The fight is for
the only things that matter—life and liberty.
The great need is for men to carry it on, and
Australia can send them forward with abso-
lute confidence in two things—one, that if
the Allies hang to the enemy long enough
they will surely lick him; the other, that,
unless they do, victory will be his, not ours.
Albert Farthing, M.L.A. for East Mel-
bourne, who recently declared his intention
of enlisting, has had to defer his “date,”
chiefly owing to a Farthing-Worrall case in
the courts. There has been no alteration in
the main Farthing intention, however.
The Vaughan Government in South Aus.
is accountable for a remarkable piece of
political strategy. The Railways Standing
Committee is elected from the members of
both Houses on a kind of mutual understand-
ing. For the Leg. Council Wilson was the
Labor man, but the party resolved to super-
sede him by Jelley. The Liberal majority in
that House savv no reason why the old hand
should be dropped, and voted Wilson in
ln the resulting row, he has been
practically expelled from the party, but
clings to his place on the Committee. So
tha Government has appointed a Royal Com-
mission to report on a proposed new rail-
way; and behold! .Jelley is on it, and Wil-
son is not, and the other names bear a strange
resemblance to those of the old Committee,
whose chance of getting any work at all to
do this year can be guessed at. Charges of
unfair dealing are freely thrown about; but
Vaughan sits tight on the ground that the
Opposition began it, by going back on the
honorable understanding that each party
shall accept the other’s nominee.
From an old visitor: —
The end is at hand of the Randwiek (Sydney)
Asylum for children. Although Henry Parkes in 1881
passed the State Children Relief Act, declaring the
State policy to be the boarding-out of helpless, de-
pendent infants instead of cooping them in insti-
tutions, the privately-endowed Randwiek home was
able to go the opposite way for 34 years, and has
now yielded only to the inexorable demands of war.
Occupying a valuable site, and representing
six figures in improvements, the institution
with its 800 beds has for years past had
only a handful of inmates. With the best
of attention, the best of systems and the best
officials, children find it hard to wipe off the asylum
brand in after-life. The boarding-out system has
its faults and abuses, but it is the proven correct
policy, and was the “modern” method all the world
over when adopted in N. S. Wales. Many prior
attempts to close up Randwiek have been defeated,
and desperate efforts were made to save it even from
the wounded soldiers, the trustees offering the
unused half of the building to buy off extinction.
As a last resort the Leg. Council was appealed to;
but even that champion of conservative methods
couldn’t do anything but obtain good terms for the
trustees. Randwiek was generously endowed, its
benefactors including Catherine Hayes, who lavished
money on it.

The deserted Government House that overlooks
Farm Cove, where the flagship swings to the tides
when it is at home in Sydney, is an intensely solemn
Sundry Show; but it has the advantages of being
soon over and free. The writer and the artist dis-
covered it on a recent Saturday afternoon, three
years after an inoffensive Gov.-General had been
chased out to provide them and the Woman Who
Had Seen a Lot of Trouble with 10 minutes’ enter-
tainment.
After a preliminary inspection of the carved stone
crests outside, and a burglar-like reconnaisance
through the window of the ballroom, we stepped
guiltily into the hall and pretended to be deeply
interested in the painted heraldic advertisements
screwed to the walls high up.
The Woman Who Had Seen a Lot of Trouble
looked sadly at one of the uniformed guardians of
the vice-regal sepulchre; and presently the oldest
guardian started off like a clockwork toy in front

of us, saying in a phonograph voice, “This way, if
yer please.”
“Oh, thenk yer!” muttered the Woman Who Had
Seen Trouble, and we trailed on behind and passed
through the first pair of glass doors.
“This ’ere’s the ’all. Up there’s th’ pitcher of
Queen Vietorier, and there you see th’ pitcher of ’ls
Royal ’lghness. There on th’ opposite wall, sir, you
see th’ pitcher o’ Governor Bumpkins, and that’s the
por-trait of Governor Slosher, sir.”
By this time he had his little audience rotating
rapidly. The painted faces of the starred and rib-
boned dead stared down indifferently at the absurd
rabble of intrusive dervishes, who danced with dusty
feet on the hall carpet.
“That’s all ’ere, sir. This way, please 1”
So from the hall, full of dignity and mellow after-
noon sunlight, to the ballroom, with the red-covered
dais staring out at the brilliant garden and the grey-
blue cruiser beyond. The click of an electric light
switch, and the pink-satin water-lilies of the big
chandelier glowed softly, showing up the quality of
two big portraits by old Joshua Reynolds. One
was Queen Caroline, the Bad Girl of the Family.
But the official phonograph was in too much of a
hurry to allow us to linger amongst the shrouded
furniture and size her up.
“These doors slides back, an’ th’ next room is used
when there’s a crush.” (When will there be a
crush again?) “Yes, sir. This way, please.”
Out flicked the lights, and we slunk after him till
we brought up like frightened slieep or intruding
dogs in the centre of a great, gloomy apartment
haunted by the ghosts of ten thousand heavy meals
and garrisoned by portraits of Governors long since
dead and gone. They were all in full uniform, these
potentates (I wondered if they slept in full uni-
form), and they seemed to have contracted the habit
early in life of standing in noble postures in front
of shadowy pillars with one hand resting lightly on
a table whereon was laid for signature a tremendous-
looking document or charter with pendant seals. The
grave has devoured the splendid originals; but their
portraits remain to appal posterity.
The Woman Who Had Seen Trouble sniffed ner-
vously and tried to appraise the massive furniture
while we elevated our chins and stared back at the
Excellencies.
“This way if you please, sir.”
The little string moved on through a back passage
from which soared a narrow, familiar, gossipy-looking
staircase into “th’ Guvnor’s orfis, sir!” Straight as
a sword from the pleasant garden without, a beam
of light fell across a flat, deserted desk, where, no
doubt, past office-holders put in some of their spare

time adding up their household expenses and wonder-
ing whether the vice-regal game was worth the golden
candle.
“Double doors, yer see, sir. Useter hold th’ Cab-
inet meetin’s in ’ere. And this ’ere’s the waitin’-
room. That pitcher, sir? That’s Governor Belmore,
sir, in ’is private clothes.” So that’s how Belmore
Markets got their name! And while we were still
considering the jolly vice-regal gentleman who con-
descended to wear private clothes in front of a
portrait-painter (he has been sentenced to the wait-
ing-room for it), a little side door opened smartly
behind us and we heard a voice say, “And that’s
the way out, sir!”
He was right as usual, confound him! It was
the way out, and we obeyed him speechlessly in turn.
The Woman Who Had Seen Trouble was our rear-
guard. No doubt she cherished to the last womanly
hopes of being shown the best bedroom; but it was
not to be.
While we lingered beneath the old grey walls, a
little dazed by the sudden sunlight, she looked back
over her shoulder much as Lot’s wife must have
done, with one hand playing nervously about her
lips.
“I don’ know!” she whimpered. “It’s grand
an’ all that, with the pitchers; but I’d like to see a
few live toffs about and ! ear th’ pianner goin’!”
And that’s just what’s wrong with the place.

“Potash and Perlmutter” tell each other
every evening that Boris, the refugee book-

cation of what modern society suffers from
its kith and kin. The end of the world will
probably come about through some strong-
minded soul starting a massacre of first

Edward Marshall, a cheery artist from the
great country which makes deadly things 1
for others to play with, came to Sydney
Tivoli on Saturday. The young man works
casually and rapidly in colored chalks, and
picks some of his models from his audience.
His turn goes easily, and he has a disarm-
ing trick of rolling up his rapid sketches
and tossing them with a smile to his vic-
tims. Mary Law pulls down the house
regularly with her brilliant and sympathetic
fiddling, and Ella Caspers exchanges her
notes of gold for avalanches of applause
and something at the treasury. The Le
Boy Sisters —they are the modern, long-
frocked variety of sistern —take their first
burst of melody seriously and slowly, which
seems rather injudicious when there is so
much first-class stuff about; but a subse-
quent relapse into pleasant and unassuming
ragtime atones. Mary Elizabeth, Betty
Donn, tenor Goldspink, Edgar Warwick’s
burlesquers and some others also inhabit the
bill, to the great advantage of that docu-
ment.

Australia, which has done much to deserve
many insults to its sense of humor, has done-
naught to deserve “Nobody’s Widow,”
tedious farcical comedy in three foolish acts,,
played at Melbourne Royal last Saturday.,
The grains of truth essential to all whole-
some dramatic compounds are wanting im
“Nobody’s Widow.” Leading characters are-
as obtrusively false as the situations the-
dramatist puts them into. Human nature-
gets no show whatever, and though some of
the dialogue has a cheap American smart-
ness, the bulk of it is the. merest piffle.
Muriel Starr, a mock widow, comes to stay
with her young friend Grace Palotta at a
villa in Florida, where there is an extraor-
dinary house party. Two of Grace’s guests
are her sleepy-headed fiance (Frank Stir-
ling) and the Duke of Moreland (Charles
Millward). The other four and a stage-
negro servant speak about 20 lines between
the five of them. They are remarkable only
for their habit of going out of the room
when Roxana (Miss Starr) and the prepos-
terous Duke are about to converse together.
They are the most witless, motiveless minor
characters in the world of fiction. -Readers
needn’t consider them dead for the purpose
of this narrative. The wretched shadows
were never born.

Muriel Starr affects to regard the Duke as
dead, owing to her having caught him kiss-
ing somebody called Susette on the day when
she married him. He was disguised as a
Mr. Clayton at the time, and nobody save
themselves knows that her supposititiously
dead husband is a real live duke instead of
a spurious Clayton. This strange American
ignorance on the part of their mutual friends
remains undisturbed to the end of the chap-
ter. Nobody, save themselves, ever knows
that widow “Claytmi” is the Duke’s wife.
When they “throw off” at one another in
company the company never tries to fathom
the meaning of their throwing-off. A dozen
times the preposterous British peer reveals
his identity with the deceased Clayton, but
nobody attaches any importance to his slips
of the tongue. Hostess Grace Palotta and
the other creatures of impossibility are con-
sistent only in their practice of leaving the
Widow and the Duke together. Then the
pair of humbugs talk of how the man wants
to live with the woman and the woman is
determined not to live with the man because
she caught him kissing Susette. Their con-
versation is wearisomely repetitional. their
actions are the merest make-believe. Finally,
in the third act, a long interview
occurs in Muriel Starr’s dressing-room, and
thus a strong odor of bedroom drama (farci-
calised) is imparted to the discussions.
Incidentally Muriel has obtained a divorce
(Lord knows how) from the Duke of many
“PLAYING THE GAME.” AT MEL-
BOURNE KING'S.
The man Who fought the
world for his che-ild! The Ghe-ild.
titles who married her under an alias. In
the interval between the second and third
acts they are supposed to have got married
again at 2 a.m., but somehow the blessed
Duke isn’t lawfully entitled to behold
Roxana in her nightie. So they talk some
more about how the man wants the woman
and the woman is vexed with the man. This
improving entertainment terminates in the
suggestion that the remarried husband ma/
probably return to Roxana’s room for honey-
moon purposes after the curtain has dropped.
* * * *
Maybe the loose back hair, the dressing
jackets, toilette mysteries and other bedroom
comedy belongings will preserve “Nobody’s
Widow” from the cruel fate it merits.
Maybe not. The present writer, for one,
wouldn’t raise a finger to save the poor
thing from swift damnation. Muriel Starr
and Millward are not nearly light and slick
enough to make the best of their unreal char-
acters, nor is Grace Palotta happily placed
as a young and foolish American woman.
As for Sydney Stirling, he is required to
impersonate chronic tiredness, and circum-
stances are very favorable to that. Two
interior scenes are nicely done by George
Upward.
At Her Majesty’s (Melb.), where the comic
operas are reviving, the second week of
“Paul Jones” is as good as the first for busi-
ness purposes, and better in its artistic re-
sults. The concerted musical numbers go
more harmoniously and the voice of the
prompter is not heard on the seashore. But
time and tide will not wait for “Paul Jones”
after Friday. The giddy old Excellency of
Estrella Island will no longer be in danger
of h—l fire for calling his nephew a f —-1, and
Malaguena will cease to look rather too large
for her outfit. The good French opera is
to be taken off, that “The Dancing Mistress”
may be put on.
Also another change of bill is threatened
ac Melbourne King’s, where honest Dan
Bailey, the pride of Silver City, continues
to deplore the skunkishness of the local
“nobs.” “They sit at my gaming-table and
get a square deal,” says that aching widower

gramme will be “Bonnie Mary of Argyle,”

Gregan McMahon’s Repertory Theatre
will awake from its long slumber at the
Athenamm Hall on Saturday, the 23rd.
Three short comedies —“Lonesomelike,”
“Hiatus” and “The Convict on the Hearth”
—will be produced. The last-named _is the
lcvely little study of life in unfashionable
society which the Repertorians treated un-
commonly well a while ago.
Newcomers at Melbourne Bijou on Satur-
day were the two Gaffs, singing and talking
comedians, and Maud Miles, a plump young
songstress who has lately been appearing
with J. C. Williamson Ltd. Hamilton and
Barnes, the effusive pattering duet, are
reviving sundry jests of uncertain age, and
the Goolmans, Lawrence Johnstone, Carl
Merlyn and F. Sidney and Co. continue their
efforts as before.

Adelaide King’s, with a monopoly of
Variety, has a jolly, mixed bill, largely
American, with Kipp and Kippy juggling
and Bollinger and Reynolds on the wire.
The Royal is about to reopen “The
Rosary,” and the Tivoli has “His Natural
Life,” with a happy ending—Elwyn Harvey
as Sylvia, the picturesque Fitzherbert as
Frere, Pat Scully the parson, and Roland
Conway the convict. Brewster Jones
organised a fine Town Hall concert, and the
Commercial Travellers another on more
popular lines. Two strong dramas appear
on the film, the savage “Sea Wolf” of Jack
London at West’s, and the Puritanic “Un-
afraid” at Wondergraph, which house is
about to commence its open-air show too.

Another very promising young Australia
has laid down his life in Gallipoli. This
was Alan McKinlay, of N.S.W. Department
of Agriculture. Graduating in 1913 from
the Government’s Hawkesbury College, he
won the Farrer scholarship, and was looked
upon as likely to follow in the footsteps of
that famous wheat breeder. He joined the
Ist Field Artillery brigade as a gunner,
fought at Krithia, and by an act of con-
spicuous gallantry won the D.C.M. But
while he dodged the Turkish bullets he
succumbed to illness soon after receiving
the decoration.
“PLAYING THE GAME” AT MEL-
BOURNE KING’S.
1.—The father she
hoped for.
2. —The sort of man
he really was.
McDouall Stuart’s journey across Aus-
tralia in 1862, from the Gulf at Glenelg
(S.A.) to the shore of the Northern Terri-
tory, is periodically recalled by the death of
one of the men who went with him and
whose names are engraved on the pedestal
of his statue at Adelaide. Billiatt, who
settled in England, still remains, but the
last survivor in Australia, Stephen King,
died last week, at 73. He was quite a
youngster on the big journey, was after-
wards a surveyor under Goyder and a trans-
continental telegraph-layer under Charles
Todd, and put in the rest of a busy life in
the Survey Department of South Aus.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“0.K.” : The war killed George Edwardes
last week. The musical-comedy king had the
ill-luck to be in Germany when the big trouble
started, and the Hymn of Hate made his life
so comparatively hard during his detention
that he never recovered from the effects.
Edwardes was still quite young when he took
over the management of London Gaiety in
1875. He saw the opening for a new form
of entertainment —a cross between comic
opera and Gaiety burlesque—and he pro-
duced it for all it was worth or a bit more.
The first musical comedies he exported to
Australia by arrangement with Williamson
and Musgrove, just 20 years ago, were “A
Gaiety Girl,” “In Town” and “Gentleman
Joe.” No subsequent imported co. of the same
class was as clever or stylish. Decima Moore,
Blanche Massey, Florence Lloyd, Madge
Rossell, Maud Hobson and Grace Palotta,
not to mention some pretty girls in minor
parts, were a bunch of charmers. Of the
men Monkhouse drew the most salary, but
he made less of a success here than Louis
Bradfield and Fred Kaye. Leedham Ban-
tock was one of the comedians and Granville
Bantock conducted the orchestra. Bantock,
long time of Australia, is their brother.
Charles Ryley, too, returned to Australia as
a member of the co. Of all the companies
that Edwardes ever formed the one that
crossed the equator in 1895 was probably
the strongest in talent and good looks; and
he must have formed many, seeing that he
was responsible for more than 70 original
and costly productions in his rattling good
time before the war.
“Busk” goes on the wallaby from Beer-
sheba unto Dan :
Mention by “Norbell” (B. 9/9/’l5) of Dan Barry
once forgetting to put on his black gloves when he
played Uncle Tom is a reminder that in coon and
other colored parts gloves are nearly always used —-
to prevent soiling the ladies’ clothes. Fred Belton,
who is still remembered by old-stagers in Sydney, was
a favorite of Chas. Kean’s, who left him an Othello
costume. Belton, rather hard up, sold it to Tither-
adge. There were fleshings for the arms and hands
in chocolate color. This Belton used to relate that in
the stalls of a Boston theatre a gentleman beside him
started conversation. Belton cut him short with,
“Sir, I want to listen to the play.” Afterwards to
his poignant regret he found it was Longfellow!
As an Edinburgh manager Belton telegraphed to
London for a principal panto, girl to take the part
almost at a moment’s notice. He was horrified by
receiving something that looked like a witch. But
at night! She was a thing of beauty ! Planche re-
lated how, behind the scenes, he saw the aged Madame
Vestris cowering and shivering on a pedestal as
Apollo. Up went the rag—and she ivas Apollo!
George Vandenhoff, as Clifford in “The Hunchback,”
had only one rehearsal with Charlotte Cushman as
Julia. “This is the ugliest woman ever I saw,” he
said. “Uglier than Macready.” But at night on
came a vision of beauty in golden curls, and he never
had such rapture in acting. Reverting to Othello.
There is the legend of the man who blacked himself
all over to get into the spirit of the thing. Ira
Aldridge, a fine Othello, was a real black. His son
performed in Sydney and Melbourne, but only in
dad’s comic parts, such as Mungo in “The Pad-
lock.”
Somebody in Melbourne suggests a
matinee performance of a popular drama for
charitable purposes, with the leading people
acting as supers and scene-shifters, and the
supers and scene-shifters acting the leading
parts. The leading ladies and gentlemen
of the company don’t seem to catch on.
Apparently they have some anxiety about
giving the show away.
Stratford-on-Avon has had its little joke
—it has been advertising itself extensively
as the “safest place in England.” Having
formally and officially annexed Shakspeare,
how could even the Huns do anything to
injure his birthplace or his tomb!
“Yung” : Final results of the eight-months’
ballot for the most popular “movies” actress,
conducted by a Yankee picture-show maga-
zine, give Clara Kimball Young 442,340
votes. Mary Pickford, who was leading
right into the straight, passed the post 5000
votes behind. Alice Joyce finished in the
ruck, with Mary Fuller and Blanche Sweet.
The winner will be best remembered in this
corner of the world for her appearance in
“Hearts in Exile.”
“Fax” : Talking of “Ma Mie Rosette” and
“Paul Jones,” nobody remembers the revivals
which happened at Her Majesty’s (Melb.)
some V2i years ago. Harold Thorley was
the Henry of Navarre, and Florence Young
the most unsuitable of Rosettes. An imper-
sonation of rustic maiden simplicity is quite
out of her line. Hugh Ward iriayed the halt,
maimed and one-eyed Colonel, and Celia
Ghiloni was the catty lady. Florence Young,
Ward, Celia Ghiloni and Maud Clietwynd
appeared in “Paul Jones,” and Pat Bathurst
had one of his best parts in it. It seems
longer ago than 1903.
“T.C.”: Actor Eric Maxon, who is now in
New, York, has lost the first finger of his
right hand —so mendacious Rumor tattles.
Whether the digit was taken off by a jugger-
naut Noo Yark tram, or was bitten off during
a passionate love scene by an over-tempera-
mental leading lady, is not yet known. Maxon
was representing the Hun spy in “The Man
Who Stayed at Home” (played here by Cyril
Mackay). One night an excited German in
the audience threw a phial of vitriol on the
stage, but only succeeded in doing another
injustice to Belgium by burning a hole in the
Brussels carpet.
Hobart is being supplied with a new
theatre. Ever since Zeehan ailverfield
started, E. J. Miller, a South Australian,
has been selling it furniture and sundries.
When Wilhelm went mad, Zeehan collapsed
like a bubble. Miller didn’t waste any time ;
he hired a train, put his stock aboard, bought
an old store in Hobart, dumped his goods into
it, and had a clearing sale that made the old
town talk. Meantime he was making up his
mind what to do with the ancient store when
he had done with it. Possibly because the
site was opposite the old Theatre Royal he
decided on a picture-show place, with bil-
liard-room and other attachments, all bigger
and ahead of anything the Speck has so fai
had. The building is now being pushed
on, and Miller has gone to the U.S.A. to look
round for extras in the way of fitments.
A son of Herbert Flemming, who was
well known on the Australian stage, ami
whose wife was even better known in the
musical world as Minna Fischer (she is now
married to George Clutsam, the M.L. com-
poser), has been killed by Ilun bullets. This
victim was Captain Herbert Flemming. A
brother of his is still at the Front.
“ Jwosp” : Hugh J. Ward is in the United
States, and by a singular coincidence which
must have given him much pain, several
N’Yark journals ran a yarn lately headed
“An Australian Hero.” This modest cap-
tion covers an even more modest description
of the excellent work done by Ward in. the
interest of patriotic and charitable funds.
It is also mentioned that when Ward left
Sydney for ’Frisco he was “accorded an
official salute as he passed the forts.”
Nothing seems sacred to these Yankee news-
papers.
“Fax”: How fitting was the end of Hal
Cohen’s musical career! Plump Hal Cohen,
Melbourne’s loveliest amateur operatic tenor,
was the pet of all the ladies. One would see
him in the audience at a Town Hall concert
with a pretty married woman on either side of
him both trying to keep the dear boy warm.
He was the tame pussy of “smart” society,
exceedingly fond of himself, though not arro-
gantly conceited. His leading virtue was
kindness to his mother, it was said. His
tenor voice all this time was rather absurdly
throaty and heady, for he had no chest notes
to speak of in his upper register. But all
the girls who like their heroes to be soft and
smooth were “awfully gone” on Hal Cohen,
or Cohn. Also, Marshall Hall extolled the
plump boy’s voice, and finally he was sent
to England. There he discovered that he had
a baritone of a sort, not a tenor voice at
all. He sang under the name of Colonna,
without winning a swift renown. Things, in
fact, might have gone ve.ry hard with him if
a love-sick heiress had not come along with
thousands and thousands a year. She thought
herself lucky when the gentle Australian
young man asked her to share them with
him. So he nowadays purrs, in the lap of
luxury and promises to die fat. His career
turned out just as a fortune-teller might
have predicted.
A Melbourne critic, finding fault with
Leslie Holland’s way of buffooning in “Paul
Jones,” said that he wasn’t as amusing as
W. S. Percy had been in the same part. But
Percy never played the part of ridiculous
Don Trocadero. It was Fred Leslie who
skipped around in the Don character, whilst
Percy was figuring as Petit Pierre the Insect
in the same cast.
Australia awaits anxiously the publica
tion by the N. S. Wales Government of a
full, true and particular account of the
great wheat-growing enterprise it entered
into when the world was nine months
younger. There was vast expenditure on
motors and ploughs, and men were thrown
into the breach without waiting for casual-
ties ; heaps of machinery (imp.) were pur-
chased and hurried to the several scenes of
action that the crops might be promptly
harvested. But there isn’t a blessed crop,
and the whole mighty concern is a heap of
stricken hope and p.n. and withered reputa-
tion. How much money has gone down the
awful sink is so far a secret, but the figures
are big enough to make the patriotic Gov-
ernment which imported a shipload of
machinery to handle the wheat that wasn’t
there wake up in the night and wipe a cold
sweat from the back of its joint and several
neck. Wilted corn three inches high covers
thousands of acres.

“Boyd Cable”: I find that my pals who
are out of this business —and feminine pals
particularly—are much less anxious for
details of the slaughter than they are to
hear about the eating and sleeping and
living. Of course, these things vary a heap
according to time and place and the “tacti-
cal scheme” of the moment. When there is
no big scrapping match on, life (apart from
the intrusion of shells, etc.) is fairly com-
fortable. We fl’m speaking of an artillery
division in Flanders) get our lations with
great regularity, and have our meals at more
or less constant hours. The rations are (1)
fresh, (2) preserved, or a mixture. At
present, and for some time past, we’ve
been on two-thirds fresh and one-third
preserved. “Fresh” means frozen meat,
bread and potatoes; “preserved” is tinned
meat (“Macconnacliie” meat-and-vegetable
ration or bully beef) and biscuit. In both
(1) and (2) are always included bacon,
cheese and Yam. Although all these things
are good and nourishing—always excepting
bully beef, which is the American red bully,
flavorless, salt as brine, and utterly uneat-
able except by starving men —they all get
deadly monotonous, and we should find it
hard to live if it were not for the Parcels
Post and the extras sent to us, plus an
occasional vegetable or milk or eggs obtain-
able locally at famine prices when one moves
back from the actual firing zone. The guns
are rather badly off in this way—worse luck,
as I’m on that job—because they remain in
action for months on end. On the other
hand, we frequently sit tight in one position
for weeks together and get a chance to make
ourselves at home in decent billets and dug-
outs, and so have the pull over the foot-
wallahs, who do a couple of days in the fire
trench, a couple in support, and then several
days in reserve or rest; and are thus always
on the wallaby.
There is very little bivouacking or camp-
ing-out for artillery, mainly because ’planes
coming over can spot such camps and pass
the word of their map position back to the
guns and have them shelled to glory. For-
tunately this country of Flanders and north-
ern France is dotted thick with farms and
villages, and the troops billet among the
fragments wherever they can find a roof
sufficiently whole to hide them. If such are
not available we dig deep holes, cover them
with a solid roof of beams and earth, and
crawl down to dinner and doss. When there
is a strenuous disturbance on all the usual
household arrangements go by the board with
a rush. Then one feeds a bricky biscuit or
a slab of bully to an unwashed face from
grubby hands, sleeps with or without a
blanket in any hole or corner of a trench or
gun-pit, or crawls for a spell into a gritty
and grimy cellar under the usual brick-heap
that was once a house. Under normal cir-
cumstances these things might be uncomfort-
able, but in all the uproar and upheaval and
blood and murder and sudden death of an
action, one is so dashed, devoutly thankful,
ai:d more or less amazed to be left alive and
in one piece, that the minor discomforts fade
into nothingness.

Victoria’s Criminal Investigation Depart-
ment was never a very swift animal, but of
late it is following too closely the example
of its head, Chief Sec. John Weary. The
“heroine” of the Sale mystery, the missing
girl Jessie Stirling, disappeared on August
10, and the police were informed 10 days
later. One would have expected them to get
on any possible trail in hot haste. But
no: they inspected the locality thought-
fully, then considered the matter delib-
erately, and on October 4, nearly two
months after the girl and man had vanished,
they took two black trackers to the place
where the pair were last seen and to where
the girl’s dress-basket was found. Such
faith in the aboriginal is touching.
But it makes the job too easy for Brother
Binghi; they should have waited a year
before laying him on. the scent.

“Now then, boys, what yer havin’ on it?”
“H. 0.”: A characteristic of Billjim in
Gallipoli is a fixed determination not to
allow his leg to be pulled, and a rooted belief
that someone is always trying to do it.
General , who was being piloted by
Colonel , looked down into an eight-foot
trench in which a number of Billjims were
doing vigorous pick work, and, apparently
with the object of making himself a good
fellow with the boys, inquired : “Well, what
“BUSINESS AS USUAL .”
CUPID: "Well, I can’t say that the war is interfering with ME!”
are you men doing there?” Work did not
cease, but a reply was promptly forthcoming:
“What the has that got to do
with you?” The staggered Colonel an-
nounced that it was a General who had asked
the question. This allegation struck Bill-
jim as being unworthy of investigation, so
he merely observed, without looking up, that
“if the blanker has been in the army long
enough to become a Geneial he ought
to well know what they were
well doing !” There being no answer to that
in the wide world, the inspection ended right
there.

“Silas”: Like a lot of other'people my
friend Piper sees German spies in his sleep,
and is determined to get the world out of
their clutches. He is a small, energetic
man (to me he always suggests an enlarge-
ment of the soldier ant, the little red devil
who can lift a 15-stone man if the 15-stoner
bestrides him aright). Besides being a
patriot he is an inventor, and his latest
appliance is for destroying German airships
and aeroplanes. The scheme is a simple
variant of the common or Fifth of November
rocket, powerful enough to carry up a man
in place of the usual stick. You simply
shoot your rocket at the aggressive Zeppelin.
The attached hero does the rest. An expert
of unusual perspicacity commented : “Yes, but
how does the man come down again?” My
friend simply hadn’t thought of that. He
went away, and returned within a fortnight
with an improvement on his device in the
shape of a parachute, to break the fall of the
man on the rocket. The passenger carries
a bomb which he hurls at the airship when
near enough. With a model it works admir-
ably ; and still the military authorities are
cold to Mr. Piper. Not a man among them
is. willing to take the trip. “That’s what a
man has to light against,” Piper confides to
me—“pro-German influence !”

Eminently sensible remark by Judge
Docker at the Anglican Synod at Sydney :
The Church needed, from time to time, a new
reformation. He was opposed to everything- savor-
ing- of superstition. Vestments—what were they?
To his mind a mere nothing. He would prefer to
see a simpler dress assumed by the clergy, and even
by his Grace the Archbishop, in the same way as
the soldiers of the Empire were putting aside their
finery and dressing in the modest khaki.
Quite so. Now._ suppose his Honor puts
aside his official finery by way of setting an
example in consistency!

Court most week was the bad smell

to 18,000, and amassed a cash balance run-
ning into five figures. lie was a capable
and energetic secretary, who got very large
concessions for his crowd ; but unfortunately
for himself he opposed the One Big Union
idea in uncompromising fashion; and when
the members of the union, after polling 7000
votes in favor of amalgamation, as against
a few hundred in opposition, were informed
that the Registrar of Trades Unions had
pronounced the vote ineffective, the angry
majority turned on O’Sullivan. Previously
invincible, he went down in the ensuing elec-
tion of officers by over 2000 votes, and George
Bodkin, for five years the union’s chief
organiser, got his job. Naturally the fol-
lowers of O’Sullivan were mad at his sum-
mary dismissal, and a charge followed
against the victorious Bodkin —concerning an
alleged fraud in connection with the pur-
chase of railway tickets for organising tours
in 1912. However badly O’Sullivan was
treated, it is good to know that the allega-
tion against the other man broke down
thoroughly.

“Carfax”: A Melbourne Socialist has
been exhorting the democracy to recognise
the inalienable “right to be lazy.” This is
a timely reminder of one of the privileges
the people of Australia are fighting for, and
one that has been overlooked by citizens,
calling themselves Socialists, who vehem-
ently denounce military -service. If the
Hun gets on top the Liberty to Loaf is
going to be mislaid for ever. The inspired
advocate of laze puts it this way :
Everybody has a right to be lazy, and when the
working class get a wholesale reduction of working
hours they will be in a better position to discuss
many vital problems.
Hear, hear! We will then have time to
consider whether getting up before 10 a.m.
is injurious, and also whether perspiration
ou the forehead should not be regarded as
prim a facie evidence of invalidity, and
therefore.of a right to a pension. Also we
shall have time to give serious attention to
the problem whether the right to laze shall be
recognised in the case of beer-carters and
wives. For my own part I believe that not
only have men a right to loaf, but they have
also a right to stand on their heads, to shift
their chins rapidly up and down, to swing
on a gate and to chew straws. This agita-
tion to reduce working hours is itself a
negation of man’s fundamental rights. De-
mands that we “Awake!” come from jackals
who would oppress the proletariat by keep-
ing us awake. Down with them, I say. and
let us usher in the Golden Age of Snore.

beautiful perch on a roof when last I wrote) or
some other elevated and unhealthy look-out. And the
batteries also get their share of the distribution of
shell favors. The Germans usually keep a number
of observation “sausage balloons” in the air—l can
count six at the moment from my observing post
and although these have to rein back far enough
from the firing line to be reasonably safe from our
shells, and so cannot spot a battery’s actual posi-
tion, they are near enough to get on to the gun
flashes. Having got this they direct the fire, and
our friends pepper away on the off chance of their
luck being in and their shells being on the battery.
Usually the bulk of their shells do no more than
excavate pits in some unoffending cornfield, or pile
in a series of new shapes the heaps of brick and
mortar that were once houses. But they do manage
to puncture a gunner now and then, or to wreck a
house that has been revived from its prostration and
had its tottering roof and doddering walls shored
up enough to make the place habitable again as a
billet. And even if they don’t do much actual and
physical damage they are a disturbing factor in the
daily routine. The proportion of hits may be small,
but somehow that would be cold comfort if one
stopped to work out the law of averages when a
string of 6- or 8-inch high explosive shells is heard
approaching at the gallop and raising a fiendish up-
roar sounding something like a regiment of runaway
electric trams, each fitted with a steam whistle
shrieking its lungs out.

New prayer of the Young Turkey Party,
adapted from the Church of England litany :
“From Enver, hatred, malice and all un-
charitableness, good Lord deliver us.”
From a Headquarters officer at Anzac: —
The Bulletin’s regrets (17/6/’l5) that for lack
of enough reinforcements soldiers were being
“patched up” and sent back to the firing line are,
in some ways, quite sound; but if hundreds of our
chaps hadn’t been patched up and sent back here we
would have had a different tale to tell of our last
really wonderful night march and attack. Hundreds
get merely flesh wounds, but can’t stop here on
account of septic. They are sent away to Malta and
Alexandria for a few weeks, and come back far
fresher and brighter than we poor devils who have
been here all the time. Men who have been here
since the beginning are weak, whereas a man going
away, after getting good food and rest, in a bayonet
rush far outstrips the trench-dweller who has kept a
whole skin, but lived on “bully and biscuit.”
A thing to be proud of is our fellows’ wonderful
stamina and lack of “nerves.” This is most notice-
able when alongside other troops. Their sense of direc-
tion is also strikingly good. The other night, the
objective being known to all, our chaps marched for
six hours, never fired a shot although under heavy
gun- and rifle-fire all the time, but used only the
bayonet, yet were never “bushed,” although moving
in five-feet scrub of wild holly and honeysuckle, with
dozens of deep ravines, nulias, etc., to get over.
Other troops, on the same job, got hopelessly boxed.
“Maphsu”: Someone has blundered —
who’s going to pay? Sergeant-Major Lamont,
killed in action at Gallipoli, left a wife and
eight children to serve his country, with the
assurance that, if the worst came to the
worst, his family would be cared for by a
grateful nation. Yet see what has hap-
pened.. . Two ladies called on Mrs. Lamont
and found she did not even have wood or
coal for cooking purposes. Out of gratitude
(let us not call it charity) these ladies
bought her some, as well as a few pound i
of meat and potatoes. This for the wife of
a man who made the supreme sacrifice.
What a tragedy is here! And what an
example for those who are still wailing
against conscription !

From “Vagabond,” still from his Observing
Post in Flanders :—•
On this Western Front, so far as the infantry is
concerned, there’s “nothin’ doin’.” But this doesn't
mean that nothing is being done to ’em. The rifle
is having a spell off in the routine trench warfare,
but the guns on both sides keep busy and do their
best to save fellows dying of boredom by killing
them off more expeditiously with shrap. bullets and
high explosives. Every now and then, when some
mysterious spirit moves, the guns get work and
systematically set about making life a misery and
death a lottery in the trenches. The German
gunners are usually the first to break the peace, and
hurl death and disaster into our trenches, blowing
bits of them in and other bits out. Our guns imme-
diately join the merry dance and set to partners by
shelling the Hun trenches opposite. It is all highly
unpleasant to the infantry, who can do nothing but
crawl into their holes and try to pull the holes in
after them.
But the unpleasantness also extends to the gunners,
particularly in the persons of the Forward Officers,
who have to inhabit a front seat in the areas of
shell-exploding performances, and who, moreover,
must usually have their seat in the top of a tall
tree or on the roof of a burst-up building (I had a
DISORDER IN THE HOUSE.
POLITICIAN'S WIFE : “ There’s the baby crying again , John. What shall we do with
him?”
SLEEPY VOICE: “I move the gentleman be ho longer heard.”
From J. W. A. Bradford, formerly editor
of Quorn Mercury and Port Lincoln
Kecorder (S.A.) :
The report of my capture and internment at
Constantinople was exaggerated. After a debate
with a shrapnel shell and an argument with three
Turks I spent six weeks in a Cairo hospi-
tal, and arn now fighting a typewriter at
the Zeitoun Headquarters. The ’writer starts
from scratch; I’m handicapped with a gammy
leg and an almost useless left hand. To ex-
cuse The Bulletin (1/7/' 15), I might add that
my name has, through some regrettable error, been
in at least four official casualty lists as “wounded
and missing.” In trenches, hospitals and camps The
Bulletin [never mind that]. The average Billjim,
when he reads in the average papers of his “won-
derful heroism,” etc., merely yawns and lights
another fag.
“WITH A HEART FOR ANY FATE:"
“Oh, I can’t go to the theatre with you to-
night—I’ve got no clothes.”
“Well, it’s moonlight — let’s go down to
Manly surfing.”
Some months ago “Pica De Vinue” mentioned in
The Bulletin that I had started a soldiers’ paper
in Egypt. The start was as far as we got. Short-
age of paper was the trouble. The sergeant in
charge of the sanitary arrangements was an unfeel-
ing brute. He discovered where his paper had
gone, and forcibly recovered it. He might at
least have waited until after we had gone to press.
Two of my companions in the venture —Fry and
Featherstone (both S. Australians) —were subse-
quently killed in action, Chadwick was wounded,
and the others are either wounded or missing.
In spite of adverse circumstances, the Engineers
at the southern end of the Dardanelles occasionally
issue a sheet of sorts. Letters taken from dead
Turks, pamphlets dropped by enemy aeroplanes, and
local items of interest make good reading. But
there are many changes in the staff.
The British correspondents were surprised and
delighted at the physique of our first lot. One of
them said he saw a battalion which must have aver-
aged sft. lOin. in height. He was not far wrong.
In my crowd—-“the Terrible Tenth” —there were
plenty over 6ft. long. I am 6ft. in my boots, and
in my section of 13 men there were four as tall as I
am, or taller. Once a guard from our company
escorted two prisoners to Cairo. The “birds” were
6ft. 3in. and 6ft. lin. respectively, while the four
men of the escort averaged a trifle over 6ft. Our
neighbors—the 11th, from Queensland, where the
climate is so bad—-were just as hearty sons of Anak
as ourselves. Most of the Turks and Territorials
are children by comparison, though There are excep-
tions.

“Boon Boon”: The Chadbands run in all
shapes. A Grenfell (N.S.W.) resident
recently organised a • boxing tournament
in aid of the local hospital; but the
committee refused to accept the money,
principally on “moral” \ grounds. Yet
a great part of the lucre that goes
to keep the local hospital -.open comes
from much more contaminating sources.
Some of it smells really unpleasant. What
does the Grenfell committee propose to do
about that?
“De Oriel” : Though you’d scarcely expect
to find it there, the most thickly populated
cemetery in Australia is the ancient bone-
yard called Dead Island, handy to Tort
Arthur (Tas.). This tiny spot, about 80
yards in area, is the resting place of about
a thousand prisoners. Space has also been
found for many civilians, officers and sol-
diers. The names of some famous regiments
are engraved upon the headstones. The old
grave of the penal sexton is vacant and
yawning—its intended occupant died and
was buried in Hobart. But there are oue or
two very old-timers left, and one of them
may find a use for it.
* * * *
“F.H.”: The Australian service rifle is
fitted with sights which permit only the
upper half of the field to be
visible at the moment of dis-
charge. The special “peep
sight,” which the Australian
rifleman uses in target-prac-
tice, permits a view of prac-
tically the whole field. While
the superior accuracy of the
“peep” has been proved be-
yond question, the military
objection to its use in war
has been that it is not ser-
viceable in a rough-and-
ready manner. The affair
has to be screwed to the side
of the rifle, find when raised
and extended makes a some-
what excessive projection,
and this is declared to ren-
der it impracticable for
hurried battle-action. But
the practice of trench war-
fare is scoffing at the theory
of office warfare. Since Billy
Khaki spends a large part of
his time at Gallipoli in
quietly potting or being
potted, there is no apparent
reason why the authorities
should object to Bill taking
his own “sight” with him.
Every one of the many ex-
pert riflemen who have left
or are soon to leave for the
Front learned to shoot with
a “peep” : and each of them paid up
to 275. 6d. for his appliance. Science
is to win this war in the long run;
and probably, in the long run, the
Australian Defence Department will
itself provide a “peep” for every rifle
that leaves this country. Meantime,
since Bill has bought his own “sight,”
and since it can be used without re-
moving the ordinary “sight,” why
not let him employ it in the trenches?
It can’t burst and injure Bill, and it
is only a light, trivial affair. • The
“peep” at this moment in my hand weighs
30z., and measures approximately 3in. x lin.
x lin. The Germans use this help. So do
British army snipers. Why not Bill —every
one of him?

The Sydney clerks who have unionised
have placed some gumpaper on their torn
amicability and decided to federate. The
repair of the rent was a wise act, seeing
that it threatened to delay the progress of
a cause that deserves well and has a hard
battle ahead of it. The disagreement arose
between the Clerks’ Union of N. S. Wales
and the Federated Clerks’ Union of Aus-
tralia—the latter formed in Melbourne and
having the adherence of the brotherhood in
most of the other States. Now that the
foolish dissension is over, the crowd will
stand on the doorstep of the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court 5500 strong.

Maoriland’s railway workshops have lately
thoughtfully perpetrated a fine little piece of
work —an ambulance carriage for transport-
ing wounded soldiers to their homes. Twenty
beds are provided, 10 on each side. The
interior is finished in white enamel, and fold-
ing chairs and stools are carried for the
convenience of nurses and relatives. The
vehicle is steam-heated and can be kept at
any temperature, and there are hot-water
geysers everywhere. A special gangway
enables stretcher bearers to walk straight up
and lift a wounded man into his cot without
any turning. The car is running on the long
Christchurch-Invercargill section, and is a
credit to the railways of Maoriland.
South Aus., which claims to do more for
its soldiers in the social way than any other
State, has opened a Y.M.C.A. hall to seat
1000—with billiard tables and other attrac-
tions—at the Mitcham camp. The opening-
concert was provided by the “Cheer-up
Society,” a strong body which has started
also a branch at Glenelg for the Morphett-
ville recruits, and is rushing up an enor-
mous “hut” by the Adelaide railway station
for the men in town. “It is no good decry-
ing the public-house,” says editor Sowden,
president of the Cheer-ups,, “unless you can
say ‘Don’t go there, come here.’ ” Con-
tractors and workmen of all trades are
doing nearly all the building and fitting-up
of the Hut by working-bees.
THE LIBERTY ROSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The cables are singing again to-day,
And the end of the war seems nearer ;
A hundred and twenty big guns, they say,
So it’s getting a trifle dearer
For the Potsdam bullies who set the tune
That is played by the watching sniper;
The Huns will be starting for home by June,
With old Death for their grinning piper.
The cables are singing again to-day.
And the heart in my breast gives answer;
Our champions have sprung from the chalk and clay,
And there’s work for dragoon and lancer.
I know, oh, I know, that the tide’s at flood,
And the guns of the Free are booming,
For there in the garden, as red as blood,
See! the Liberty rose is blooming!

RAPID FAT REDUCTION WITHOUT
EXERCISES OR STARVATION DIETS.
“One great objection to exercises for fat
reduction,” says a noted health scientist, “is
the after exhaustion and discomfort they
generally cause those who adopt this method
of becoming slender. Yet superfluous fat
can be rapidly and surprisingly reduced in a
more simple way. (let a dram of quassia
chips and three ounces of cirola-bark extract
from any chemist. Put the quassia chips in
a pan and pour a cupful of boiling water
over them, then after they have stood for a
minute strain the liquid through a cloth and
add the cirola-bark extract. Rub this lotion
into the fatty parts of the body, hips, abdo-
men, chin or wherever excessive fat exists,
for about 10 minutes night and morning by
a circular movement of the hand. As the
preparation is absorbed by the skin it dis-
solves the fat tissues underneath, at the same
time tightening the loosened skin, and leaving
it beautifully smooth and firm.”*

Although for several years lie exhibited
regularly at the Academy, artist Phillips Fox,
who passed out in Melbourne the other day,
was, like Rupert Bunny. Ambrose Patter-

to receive a gold medal from the Salon des

A QUESTION OF MEASUREMENT.
Washington messages report that the Arabic case
has been settled on the basis of Germany apologising
and paying compensation for the loss of American
lives.— Cable.
THE HUN : "How much?”
The cable reports Major Tremearue killed
at the Front. 11 is father, Dr. Tremearue,
lived at the luxurious Mandeville Hall,
Toorak, formerly associated with Rupert
Clarke’s uncle Joe. The Major, when killed
in France, was with the Seaforth High-
landers. Born at Creswiek. he was educated
at Ballarat College and Geelong Grammar
School. He began a medical course at Mel-
bourne University, but turned to the mili-
tary. At 18 he had been lieutenant in the
Ballarat Militia. His first taste of the real
thing was in the Boer War, from which he
was invalided to England. Promoted cap-
tain, he was offered an Imperial commission,
but declined it; yet he was presently sent as
special-service officer with an Ashanti Expe-
dition, and became Adjutant of the West
African Regiment at Sierra Leone. Re-
turning to Australia in 1901 he passed ft r
major and was attached to the Queensclilf
Garrison. Soon Africa called again, and he
went to Nigeria in 1903 to help raise a mili-
tary police force. This time fie spent more
than seven years among the niggers before he
was invalided to London, where he wrote a
number of books, mostly on West Africa,
lectured at Cambridge, and in spare time
graduated M.A.
The metal-broking Mertons, who had a
line leg-pulling time at the beginning of tin-
war. have had their pot put on at last. It
was their misfortune that at the start they
pulled Attorney-General Hughes’s leg; and
Hughes’s isn’t a good leg to pull. As a
matter of fact. Hughes had grave doubts
about these people from the first: but they
bad got hold of the British Admiralty—had
actually, after the war started, been ap-
pointed to handle tin* Admiralty's copper sup-
plies—and the Australian Government
couldn’t very well take up a wholly hostile
attitude. One of the humorous side-issues of
tlie business was that llirsch’s agent in
Australia was prosecuted if not actually at
the instigation, at any rate with the warm
approval, of the Mehrten people i Merton is
the English of it). Though the Mertons and
the llirsehes co-operate when it's Germany
v the world, they are otherwise bitter trade
rivals. Generally speaking, the Mertons
represent the Gentile, while the llirsejies
stand for the Jew interest; and what even
the very wealthy Jew has to put up with
in a social way in Germany may be judged
from the fact that, though the llirsehes prac-
tically own the town of Halberstadt. where
their works are. they are not admitted to
membership of any club in the place.
From “The Oldest Inhabitant” :
“Hoff’s” manager, C. J. Hope, died last week
after a short illness. Many years ago he came from
South Carolina, U.S.A., and took a hand at the
Palmer gold-fields. Then he was gathering tin at
Glen lanes. Afterwards he became connected with
a printing business in Melbourne, and later he
joined “Hoffs, Limited,” in Sydney. In 1854 Isaac
Hoff was a tailor in Little Collips-street East, Mel-
bourne. In the first ’GO’s he combined with his
tailoring business that of bill-poster. lie did the
posting personally, and with bucket, paste and brush
filled a long-felt want. The business grew. This
writer in 1862 gave him bills to post. As he did
the sticking. himself we were sure to have it done
honestly. Prior to that the two theatrical printers,
Charlwcod and Son, and Shaw, Harnett and Co., did
the posting. In a few years the firm became Isaac
Hoff and Son, and as late as 1877 the firm was
“I. and J. Hoff, clothiers and bill-posters.” Now
the big business is owned by a limited company.
Maoriland' remembered an incident in
another war last month. On Sept. 7,
istio, Captain Swift and a lieutenant of tlie
Goth Regiment, with a few men, were recon-
noitring in the Waikato when they fell into
an ambuscade. The captain, lieutenant and
seven men were killed and 11 were badly
wounded. As the captain was dying he
handed his revolver to a private named
McKenna. “Do your best,” he said.
McKenna did well enough to get the V.C.
He afterwards joined the railway service
and later had charge of the Wanganui and
Palmerston North stations. His bit of
bronze is now a cherished thing in the Auck-
land Museum. One man who was in the
happening is still alive, T. Innis, of Ilawera
(M.L.). He was amongst the 150 men of
the Royal Irish who rescued the survivors.
Dean Talbot, of Sydney, found three par-
sons in a single field-ambulance service in
Gallipoli—Private Andrews, vice-president
of the Bush Brotherhood, Dubbo; Private
MacGregor, who has been mentioned in dis-
patches ; and another. In the trenches he
met Lance-Corporal Maxted, who was for-
merly rector of St. Oswald’s, llaberfield;
Sergeant Stott, who was Canon Stott, of
Newcastle; and a son of the Bishop of New-
castle. Talbot had the sorrowful job of
burying Digges la Touche, the scholarly
Glebe parson, who, as might have been ex-
pected, died an heroic death. And there are
others —including that Wollongong Congre-
gational parson who, after inspiring his
little crowd to enlist to the extent of .’>7
members, himself stepped un from the pulpit
into the camp:

G. W. Smith, who crossed from Westralia
four years ago to see that the trains on the
Tas. Government railways keep up their
normal average speed of 12 miles per hour
and pay working expenses and 2 per cent,
interest on the cost of construction, has been
reappointed as Commissioner for a couple of
months while the Ministry tries to straighten
out a kink or two in the Act under which lie
was engaged. Then he is likely to get the
job for four years more. He has been look-
ing out for one worth more than £l2OO per
annum : but jobs like that are not plentiful
these days. For its part the Government
is not anxious to make a change.

The man who gave Australia its first
official introduction to the stars celebrated
his 00th birthday last week. The Tier.
William Scott was appointed Astronomer in
ISSG, and two years later H. C. Ilussell
joined him as assistant. The parson held the
job for six years, and then, for healtii
reasons, resigned, became headmaster of the
Cook’s River Collegiate School, and. later,
warden of St. Paul’s College. At 90 he still
enjoys good health, which is a curious cir-
cumstance, seeing that lie was continually
changing one position for another because
he didn’t think he felt very well.
“Chasuble”: The Salvation Army lost
last week, by death, an officer who had been
second to none in value. Brigadier McPhee,
chief headquarters (Melbourne) treas-
urer and accountant for thirty years—ever
since Major Barker began, on a paltry
scale, at Collingwood Flat, without even a
roof over him. McPhee, a particular friend
of mine, made me think of Barnum’s pro-
cession entering Pianketank. There was the
Queen of Beauty in her gorgeous car. a
throne, drawn by a host of elephants,
camels, ostriches, buffaloes, gnus, etc.,
attached by garlands, and magnificently
caparisoned. People said : “Surely the draw-
ing of the queen does not require all those
animals!” As a matter of fact, not one of
them pulled a single ounce! The pulling
was all done by an old horse, covered up.
Modest McPhee was the old horse of the Sal-
vation Army. I fancy I see his spectacled
phiz peering over the battlements of Heaven
and protesting that he never did anything,
lie and Brigadier Ilendy, designer and
carrier out of ugly but useful buildings,
have been the most valuable men in the
Ilarmy. McPhee was not much good as
fugleman on a platform. He couldn’t sema-
phore his arms and run up and down, but
was worth a shoal of the officers who figure
before the public. Is the Army’s business
capacity a marvel? Look to the McPhees
and Ilendys, able business men and women,
cheerfully accepting wages far below their
market value.
Carl Hansen, of Ballendella (Vic. >, is
one of the Viking breed. He has two sons at
Gallipoli, one of whom sent a nosegay of
red, white and blue flowers (poppies, daisies
and bluebells) from the battlefield. After a
message or two of that sort Hansen, senior,
had to go to camp. He had smelt blood on
the letters or the flowers from the trenches,
so he left his irrigation block to the younger
chips of the family, and shouldered his rifle,
too.
The Historical Society of X. S. Wales
has persuaded the Government to spend a
trifle in commemorating the work of James
Ruse, the first man to grow grain in Aus-
tralia. Phillip, hearing that Ruse had
farmed in Cornwall, offered him an acre at
Parramatta, promising him more if he could
make wheat grow. Ruse succeeded and
Phillip signed over to him .’5O acres —the
first land grant in Australian history. His
bones are at Campbelltown.

Out of the Shadow
into the Sunlight
A man steps out of the shadow into
the sunlight, and for the moment he
becomes the focus of all eyes. Con-
sciously or unconsciously the impres-
sion he creates, the mental photo-
graph, remains long after lie has
passed out of sight. And it is just
in this way that half the world forms
its estimate of a man, whether he
ivills it or no.
It is a question : Does the average
man realise how frequently lie
becomes the central figure ol the
moving-picture of every-day life?
—as he leaves the doorway of his
home in the morning, as he joins'
the waiting crowds at railway plat-
form or ferry wharf, or steps out of
his office at noon —-even as he turns
the corner of the busy street.
Literally lie steps out of the
shadow into the sunlight many
times a day —every day, and every
time he leaves an impression, favor-
able or otherwise, just as he will's it.

The war hasn’t done this co. much harm
yet. The chances are that, had it not come
to the rescue, more or less, the figures for
last year would have shown up pretty badly
on account of the widespread drought and
the- extreme slackness of things in Westralia.
The explanation of the comparatively poor
profits and dividends of the previous four
years lay partly in the large increase in
wages and other costs, but (since the ship-
ping public has had to make that increase
good) more in the co.’s policy of building
vessels that really* got ahead of the trade.
Further, as the co. had been paying a big
dividend on watered capital, it didn’t have
the money to pay for the new fleet, and it
fell pretty deeply into expensive debt. This
shows: —
1910. 1915.
Liabilities (unused tickets and
sundry creditors) £79,514 £362,695
Assets (other than steamers, free-
holds, etc.) 118,503 153,341
Surplus assets . . . . £§8,989
Excess liabilities . . - £209,354
The war mopped up the three new big pas-
senger steamers one after another, and all
of them are now under Government charter.
To this must be added the demand for vessels
for deep-sea work —a demand which gave
this co. a chance to also release some of its
big inter-State cargo ships on more profit-
able jobs. One way and another, therefore,
the co. did far better than it has done of
late, notwithstanding increased taxes and
other war demands. The position is, how-
ever, not permanently improved by these
things, except to this extent —that the com-
paratively big revenue now coming in is
allowing the co. to wipe out some of the
debt which has been a gobd deal of a burden
of late years.

The Bulletin declines to guess at some of
the figures that are necessary to complete
the last line. It would be an easy thing to
say how much the dividends would call for if
the capital kept steady; but it is on the
increase all the time, and as the co. only
pays out div. on new capital from the date
on which that new capital is paid in, and as
that date is unspecified, the exact amount
of the dividend is uncertain. As for the
bonus, it amounts to 5 p.c. rebate on most
purchases made by shareholders, with a
refund of sales commissions running up to
30 p.c.
The co. is one‘of the most progressive in
Maoriland, and is so much in the lead of
the co-operative movement that Australian
producers with longings for co-operation usu-
ally send across to it for literature to guide
them. The trouble mostly is that a co-
operative concern won’t manage itself any
more than a State socialistic concern or a
straight-out private enterprise concern ; and
the failure to recognise that fact is costing
the people hundreds of thousands of pounds.
Given good management, which mostly in-
sists on being well paid, there is practically
no limits to the possible successes of co-
operation. This concern has been steadily
moving on towards new successes; and now
if is co-operating with other co-operative
concerns to eliminate the wholesale profit-
maker. The movement in which it is so
active is one of the utmost national import-
ance. The simple fact with regard to the
country producer is that he has been so
shamefully bitten by the city sharks that life
on the land has been made dull and un-
attractive. Premier Holman, of N. S.
Wales, said the other day that the “poor
farmer” generally dies rich. It is a stupid
untruth; not only does the farmer who
sticks to farming generally die poor, but he
and his missus spend in their lifetime about
as much as Holman and his missus spend
in a twelve-month. And the reason they
mostly don’t spend money is that they
haven’t got it to spend, because of the out-
rageous bites taken out of their earnings by
various middlemen. At this present
moment, for instance, when wheat is (Js. 3d.
in London, it is very doubtful whether the
farmer could get 3s. in the wheat-growing
districts; and 3d. is to come out of that for
the wheat sack. In a hundred ways the
co-operative movement, by saving the
farmer, can help to save the country. It is
the greatest remedy for parasites yet dis-
covered. So Tiie Bulletin gives this
society its blessing and forgives it for not
supplying all the information this paper
would like to have in the balance-sheet.
The co. finances clips and crops on the
road to market, and as that takes a heap of
money its own liabilities are pretty heavy

However, besides the capital (which is in-
tact), there are reserves running to about
£130,000; so that the shareholders’ own
funds amount to about £535.000, while all
sorts of liabilities total £675,402. The debt
isn’t therefore at all dangerous, especially as
(1) no less than £240,857 of the deposits
have a currency of from two to five years ;
(2) £157,026 is held in cash or on short call;
and (3) £459,451 consists of “advances
against . stock, grain, etc., and produce
shipped,” which is or ought to be money
that can be got in pretty quickly. The
financing appears therefore to be done on
very safe lines. -

The profit is well maintained considering
the shrunken income from foreign exchange
and the larger outgoings on account of taxa-
tion and war-relief funds. That the bank
will be able to keep it up seems doubtful,
though, in view of the shrinkage in ad-
vances, as shown hereunder :

But if the figures indicate the likelihood of
smaller profits they also indicate a distinctly
stronger position. Of the total liabilities
nearly 52 p.c. are now held liquid ; and that
is a very unusual proportion for a Tasmanian
bank. Further, the shareholders’ funds
represent £1 for every £4 Ss. of the public’s
money in the business; and that is a posi-
tion which ought to satisfy depositors and
others that they haven’t anything to worry
about. It may be that the deposits are
swollen by money lodged more for safe cus-
tody than anything else; but even so, it is
evident that, when the clouds clear, the bank
will be in a position to do a further fair
amount of lending. Which is another way
of saying that on its present resources the
bank ought in normal times to be able to
increase its advance business and therefore
its profits.

Here it is assumed in the last line that, as

The cash receipts show a slight falling-off,
while working expenses continue to move
up; no doubt the terrific price of fodder
made a substantial difference in costs of
delivery, Australia being, according to a
visitor who sees things, “the countrv that
won’t carry parcels for itself.” Cartage
jumped nearly a thousand pounds, and rates
and taxes were £1774 as against £730 for
the corresponding part of 1913. This shows
the business in more detail: —

Share capital is only £27,783, and liabilities
on all accounts amount to under £34,000.
That the co. can do such a business on such
figures and maintain a stock of over £05,000
is due to (1) the fact that it hasn’t
sunk capital intended for trading in expen-
sive city property, and (2) the cash system
being vigorously encouraged. Customers’
debits on July 31 were only £9452. The
co.’s premises are leasehold, and improve-
ments, etc., now stand in the books at
£18,040, which amount is written down at
the rate of about £9OO a year.

This is the poor relation in the family of
Sydney Harbor ferry cos. It has three
troubles: (1) on a capital of £50,090 it has
freeholds valued at £34,594, and they cost
a lot in taxes, and don’t bring in much in
either land-sale profits or picnic revenue;
(2) the plunging in properties meant con-
siderable debt; and (3) the co.’s services
are mostly in keen competition with trams.
Compare the position with that of three
years ago:—

Ship property .. .. 45,685 57,319
Freeholds . . . . 34,894 34,263
Other assets . . . . 3,146 5,246
On the face of things there hasn’t been much
improvement there. But everything depends
on the virulence with which ship property
has been written down out of revenue to
counterbalance depreciation. The ship pro-
perty item has gone up £11,034, and this is
how the co.’s mosquito fleet lias changed :
Gone Off the List,. Added.
Me Mel. Lady I erguson.
Birkenhead. Ladv Scott.
Shamrock. Lady Edeline.
The vessels that have gone were ancient
arks. The Me Mel and Birkenhead were
sunk, and the Shamrock was sold. Even
allowing that some of the machinery in the
old boats was utilised, £11,634 is so far
under the value added to the fleet in the
three years that it looks as if a substantial
amount has been written off against depre-
ciation. Which means that the profit dis-
closed has been fully earned after allowing
for reasonable wear and tear. On the
other hand, it is plainly not a gold mine, and
there are no prospects of a brilliant future.

The co.’s revenue is now practically all
derived from its holding of shares in what is
generally known as the Brewery Combine,
though it isn’t a combine in the ordinary
sense of the term —it is a co. which actually
owns_ the. business, and has leases of the
premises it employs. This Combine co. now
pays a very steady dividend and apparently
makes a comfortable reserve ; so the Foster
co.’s surplus profit is really a bit more than
shows. Apart from the shares, the co. prior
to paying its dividend owned assets valued
at £BlB9, mostly sundry debtors and
balances owing on property sold, and its
liabilities total £435. Its future depends
on the Combine; and as that is a brewery
concern and not a pub-owner, the outlook
is fairly good, in spite of legislation against
“the Trade.” At the same time this is to be
remembered: if things slacked off, for any
reason whatever, there would be no assets
worth mentioning to divide, inasmuch as
by far the greater part of the capital of the
Combine (and therefore of this co.’s share in
the Combine) is represented by intangible
goodwill.

So in 10 years, besides yielding the dividend
and paying for all replacements and addi-
tions, the co. has put by £3lBO towards
reserves and the cost of extraordinary
renewals that may have to be made by anil
bye. It is impossible to say what the addi-
tions have cost. They have probably been
very fair, seeing that six months’ gas sales,
etc., brought in only £174(1 10 years ago, as
against £2251 in the past six months.

The dividend paid for the year wipes out the
liability to the cumulative pref. shareholders.
The improvement shown is apparently the
further result of. the saner policy adopted
by a new management two or three years
ago. Prior to that the co. tried to win
Melbourne Cups when it was only up to
cab-horse form; and floods and bad debts
completed the disaster. Even now it must
go warily, because it is heavily in debt, and
it has still given much credit to people in a
part of the Dominion where the farmers
have paid most extravagant prices for land.
This shows the position in some important
details: —

Of the capital indicated above the bulk is of
course lost. It now rests with the share-
holders who have profitable business to
give the co. and with the management to
decide whether there shall be a further loss
or a recovery. They certainly can’t lose
much more and remain in the business.

On the available figures the dividend is not
justified ; but so few figures are available
that it is possible a right judgment cannot
be formed. All the same, a co. of this sort
which in four years pays away £5373 and
puts by only £922 ought to vindicate itself.
It isn’t the right way to attract clients, nor
is it the right way to make shareholders
forget that, while their paid capital is only
£lO,OOO, their liability is £40,000. Further,
the odious practice is pursued of lumping
most of the assets as “sundry debtors.” The
law should not allow a trustee co. to adopt
these methods.

AFTER FORTY YEARS!
[Fob The Bulletin.]
The report of the Victorian Railway Commission-
ers for the past year tells a sorry tale Not only
did the traffic receipts decrease by nearly £400,000
which was inevitable—but there was an increase in
working expenditure of £372,000. Then the capital
charges for interest were added to by £90,000, and
as a result there was a deficit of £B!,2,JjS6.
—News item.
Forty-odd years ago, eloquent members,
Grinding blunt axes and rolling big logs,
Urged upon Ministers no one remembers
Action “to save the State going to the dogs”:
“Give us a railway, and give it us quickly!”....
“Build us our line—for it’s certain to pay!”....
“Down in my district the crops grow so thickly
We must have a railway to shift ’em away.”
Jones, Brown and Robinson—all long departed—-
Hustled dead Ministers madly along.
Millions were voted; the railways were started—-
Forty years back, when things couldn’t go wrong!
Featly and neatly the money was borrowed—
Four per cent, interest, five per cent, too —
Nobody worried and nobody sorrowed ;
All bills were met with a glad IOU!
Drought was a rarity, War a mere vapor;
Also, Australia was “too far away!”
Each line would pay for itself^—upon paper—■
What did the experts (dead twenty years) say?
“Boundless resources,” “Our Future enlarges,”
“Ideal assets and build up the State”
“Working expenses? Pooh! Those trifling
charges—
Look at-the passengers! Look at the freight!”
Thus spake the experts. Some got up and snorted
l\hen it was hinted that they might have erred !
Engines, material, rails were imported.
rt hat ? Make them here ? The idea is absurd !. ...
Well, that s the story—and now for the sequel:
What do the present Commissioners say?
Expenses and earnings are slightly unequal,
But the lOU flourishes grandly—HOOßAY!

ilie recent annual meeting of Melbourne
General Motorbus Co. disclosed a lovely
state of discord arising from the intrigues
which had sickened manager Burnside of his
.lob long before he resigned. Chairman
Downs opened the animated discussion by
stating that some of the other directors
thought it wise not to print the whole of
the manager s report.” The suppressed por-
tion, if read between the lines, looks very
like a complaint, that Burnside was persist-
ently thwarted in his endeavors to get all
the co. s plant and rolling stock under one
root. Coming from England to manage the
amalgamated co., he had found it still divided
into the ‘Red” and “Blue” sections, amal-
gamated only in the Profit and Loss account.

Zeehan (Tas.) feels better now that
Mount Lyell, after a lot of testing and
thinking, has taken an option over the Her-
cules, Tasmanian Copper and Primrose
mines. This group of mixed metal mines
has never done much good, mainly because of
the difficulties of treating its complex zinc-
iferous ores. The Tasmanian Metals Ex-
traction Co. started to put in smelters at
Rosebery and had a contract to treat the
Tasmanian Copper Co.’s ore, but it never
got beyond experimenting. The Hercules
and Primrose used to send ore to the Tas-
manian smelters at Zeehan, but the results
were not very satisfactory, and the smelters
died anyway. If the Lyell people take hold
of the thing they will no doubt make it go.
Hercules shares have been down about 7s.
lately, and some of those who think they
know have been buying them up, reckoning
that they are going to jump.

Great Cobar created quite a surprise lasi
week when the twice-adjourned application
for suspension on the Cobar Gold and Ches-
ney leases came before the Warden. Though
three months’ suspension was granted, man-
ager Hogan Taylor announced that he was
in receipt of information to the effect that
unwatering could commence immediately.
This job will take about three weeks, and
then necessary work for a resumption of
smelting will "be put in hand, if no word to
the contrary is received from London. The
furnaces will probably be blown in about
the New Year.
C.S.A., Cobar, is being overhauled by
.T. R. Godfrey, formerly mine inspector in
the Cobar district, as a preliminary to
another effort to secure a railway. Mean-
while a slow (painfully slow) effort is being
made by the co. to erect a water-jacket fur-
nace to treat the richer ore on the spot.
G. Moore, a surveyor from the Great Cobar,
has recently run his professional eye over
the property.

Reported that a Victorian crowd is about
to take over the Golden Lily mine, Long-
Creek, near Windeyer (N.S.W.). Unlike
many of the shows Vic. speculators have
been introduced to in N.S.W., the Golden
Lily has been a good little mine, and lias
turned out a lot of gold for the proprietors,
the Winter Bros. At one period, worked in
a rather desultory way, when its farmer-
owners could spare time from the farm, it
was crushing op nee stuff with its little five-
head battery. It may be only a has-been:
but some of the N.S.W. bonanzas Vic. people
have stumbled upon never were mines, and
never will be. Even a glorious past is more
refreshing than an inglorious future.

Wiseman’s Creek (N.S.W.) shows no
signs of joyous activity. The Mabel plant
is gradually leaving; the recent high price
of copper failed to tempt anyone to have an-
other go at the old Phoenix ; and North and
South Wiseman’s still slumber serenely with
all the oilier little copper and gold shows
that small parties have opened in the past.
Breakfast Creek, the Bendigo-owned gold
show between Wisemans and O’Connell, is
also under a cloud. The 10-head battery (part
of the old Lucknow mill, Orange) is hung
up, and only a couple of men are pottering
in a shaft designed to test the reef at a
depth. Yet there are many less promising-
bits of country than that between the
Phoenix and Mabel mines, though the ore is
bad for either amalgamation or cyaniding.
Old Phil Foran is still working away on
Copper Hill,. and his latest shipment to the
smelters assayed 25 p.c. copper worth £l3
per ton at the smelters. Considering that
this show has been worked in a most primi-
tive way by the owner for several years, a
windlass being the only machinery, there
must be fair ore to stand the cost of raising,
freight and treatment. Copper Hill is said
to be the first place in the district where
copper was discovered, by Dr. Stuart Robert-
son, many years ago.

Aliclc Sanderson has got his Central Gold
Mines Co.—to acquire the Central and Cen-
tral Extended at Southern Cross (W.A.)
into being. Fred Tricks is manager, which
argues a lieavv interestedness of the Edna
Ma y crowd. The co. secures also the appli-
cant’s interest in the Frasers, Frasers
South, and South Extended, which gives the
new ownership the whole of the Fraser line
and the Maori Lass lease and plant, includ-
ing a 10-head mill. The mines which the
co. acquires have milled 344,776 tons for
£755,350. Early-day costs were as much as
an ounce a ton, and cyanide was unknown.
The ore body became hard below 120 ft., and
water heavy, and the later history consists
mainly of tributors’ returns of 1489 tons for
3783 tons. The Central main shaft is down
245 ft., with a drive north in ore said to be
of higher grade than that at 120 ft., below
which level the mine is virgin. The co. is
in 60,000 shares of £l, of which 30,000 are
contributing.

Edna May Battler (W.A.) claims that
three assays made under the supervision of
Williams, manager of the Edna May, gave
soz. 7dwt., 2oz. 13dwt., and loz. IJdwt.
The first was obtained from a sample broken
underfoot at the 50ft. level, the second from
a similar one taken out of the 100 ft. level,
and the third was from the dump. A 100-
ton crushing estimated to average 2oz. over
the plates is about to be treated.
Edna May Junction lias committed suicide
and so added another to those that lie sleep-
ing in the Westonia burial-ground. Bome
of the Westralian shareholders are greatly
incensed at its action, and would if. they
could oppose its interment. However, it did
the best thing under the circumstances. By
doing away with itself now seripholders -will
receive about 2s. per share, whereas if it
had delayed the tragedy much longer they
would have got nothing.
A Bulletin man at Westonia
Edna May hasn’t done badly. So far it has
given nearly four times its subscribed capital to
shareholders, and its ore reserve contains a profit of
quite as much —a thing rarely seen in a quartz mine.
The “Deeps” has a first-rate chance of becoming- a
mine at depth, but the battery proposed by the con-
trollers is not wanted yet. Shareholders should put
up enough money to sink the shaft and develop
ore reserves. At a later stage, when there is a fair
tonnage in sig-ht, a mill can be installed. Mean-
while mine development is the scientific step to
take. As every mining man knows, it gives the
mine, as a mine, the best chance in the long run.
The probable trend of the shoot is the chief topic
of local discussion, and anyone who speaks out of
his turn runs the risk of being “plugged.” Some
argue that there won’t be much gold left in the reef
by the time it leaves the Edna May; others reckon
that the body will remain for ever in the “Deeps” ;
others again that the Central will get a look in
before the shoot goes much deeper. Contention No. 1
is blown out by the fact that there is nothing to
indicate that there will be any substantial falling-
off of values in depth. Now for the other two. The
Centralites claim that the pitch of the shoot will
for a certaint}' carry it across the corner of “Deeps”
into their show. The “Deeps” crowd scout this
theory and declare that the run of gold is main-
taining its normal and regular course and gaining
both in length qf ore and length of shoot as the
reef underlies north towards and-into the “Deeps.”
In support of this they point to the fact that in
the Greenfinch, in the Consolidated and even in the
Central itself all the shoots of gold pitch west.
Only further development can decide who is right,
but the odds appear to be overwhelmingly in favor
of the “Deeps.” To overcome any serious water
difficulty that may arise in the “Deeps” shaft, man-
ager Stuckey proposes to put down drill holes 30ft.
ahead, and by means of a powerful pressure pump
force the water out of the country rock and put
liquid cement in its place. The cement will be given
three days to set, and sinking will then be continued
through it and until another series of holes are
necessary. The method has succeeded elsewhere,
and may do so here. Development work at the No.
4 (300 ft.) level in the Edna May is at a standstill
and will remain so until the extra pumping plant
that is to grapple with the water difficulty is in-
stalled. This will perhaps mean another three
months’ wait.
The most disappointed co. on the field is the
Greenfinch. First it had a chance of acquiring the
Edna May arid refused; then it was successively
offered the Central and “Deeps,” but turned up its
nose at both. Now it is in very reduced circum-
stances. The rest of Westonia is made up of leases
that are mere speculative counters. Two or three
are not without value, but most are dreadful rubbish.
The market has been lively in Edna May
Deeps. Kalgoorlie and Perth crowds, who
won’t swallow the freakish Westonia field,
got a gruelling over Ednas. They have never
understood the Melbourne speculator, with
his small Share-register company and his
bullish belief in any concern on to which he
freezes. Per contra, the Westralian
measures up ore reserves, and then sails in
on the bull or bear tack. Hence his original
nip over Edna Mays and the rise in the price
of shares to over £9. Some Westralians who
were squeezed over Ednas wanted to get a
bit of their own back when they took to
specking Deeps. They might have succeeded
if no one else had joined in the game. But
an Adelaide platoon tumbled into the firing-
line—all old stagers at the game, who ought
to have known better. Now the hunt on the
market is for scrip to complete deliveries.
As with the Duke of York squeeze, a lot of the
intermediates are being winnowed out by the
adoption of clearing-house tactics, but there
will be a few left to dance to the piping of
the bull crowd. To make the jig the livelier
there. is a chance of the Edna May folk
agreeing to swallow the Deeps. If that be
not done, manager Stuckey’s report to the
Deeps Board on what water means in the
way of finance lias to be chewed over.
From a Melbourne man :
lie the Linden (W.A.) field (B. 30/9/’l5). From the
Olympic since the first return in 1913 the owners have
treated 156 tons from 100 ft. down (not 30ft., as The
Bulletin said) for a yield of £4OOO. The other
property referred to is presumably the Democrat, and
from this a crushing of 1881 tons, obtained at a
depth of 270 ft., yielded 61370 z. So the field can’t
be so very “badly handicapped by water in large
quantities at a shallow depth.’’
Westralia’s gold output still shrinks. For
the nine months ended September 907,6630 z.
valued at £3,855,512 were produced, which
is substantially below the figures for the
same term last year. It seems that 1915’s
total will be about 25,0000 z. below that of
J 914, and the lowest since the fields were
discovered.

Whim Well Copper Co. (W.A.) again
seeks reconstruction. This time it wants to
be a c-o. with a capital of £225,000 in £1
shares, which will carry a liability of 55.,
shareholders being offered share for share.
It also proposes to issue £52,000 worth of
7 p.c. debentures and £7OOO worth of non-
eumulative G p.c. debentures for the pur-
pose of satisfying present debenture holders
and other creditors. Of the ordinary shares
100,000 are guaranteed. Calls on these are
expected to realise £22,500, and after paying
various exes, the new concern will, if every-
one pays up, have £15,000, which is con-
sidered sufficient for a fresh start and the
shipment of. ore.

Chaffers (W.A.) is to be auctioned on
the 27tli inst. Neither Boulder nor Horse-
shoe —its next-door neighbors—are said to
be keen, and if they do not bid, and Lake
View and Star (which also adjoins) re-
fuses to make an offer, the “lot or lots” will
be split up among second-hand dealers.
Black Range West (W.A.) has a good

that the last crushing of 25dwt. per ton may
be taken as a fair average of the ore in
sight. The Nos. 2 and 3 levels have lately
been connected, and driving has been re-
sumed in what is described as a “fine body
of stone.” The sljow has been a long time
justifying expectations, and there is still a
strong doubt as to whether it will do more
than keep a few men in employment and
help the local store- and pub-keepers to make
a living.
A howl ascends from Jumbunna Coal,
Gippsland, because it has achieved a bank
debit during the winter months when trade
ought to have been brisk and profits good.
The co.’s record is good as a wage-payer,
poor as a dividend-getter. In 25 years
1,096,781 tons of coal have gone to the
market. Goodness knows what concessions
the State railways have made to help profits,
but wages have piled up to £535.906, while
shareholders have netted only £36,000 in
dividends. Of course there is an explana-
tion ; but it isn't the one the directors throw
on the table. Faulted and narrow seams—
that’s the chief trouble. It may have been
Bulgar tactics for men to strike when the
winter trade was in bloom; but as they
can’t put up an effective scrap during sum-
mer, they had to choose their fighting-
ground. Yet, with plenty of backs open,
Jumbunna should crawl on to the dividend
list again, even after yielding a bit more to
the workmen.

Specimen Hill, Bendigo, has gone back
to 280 ft. to test the shallow ‘'round by winz-
ing in centre country. This is because the
intermediate below 1335 ft. has not panned
out nicely. The idea there was to pick up
the run of shoots that helped Virginia next
door. As 1280 tons of spurry stuff gave
Specimen Hill only 3060 z., it looks as if
the manager has done the right thing in
starting out on the upper plane. Still, as
the deep level is on the course of a slide,
there is always a chance of cutting into a
patch near the fault. But, anyway, Speci-
men Hill is a drab-colored show.
That ex-Bullfinch float, the Hansel Mon-
day. of Bendigo, comes on the call list after
having tossed a cool £lO.OOO into the Cars-
halton side-line. The co.’s best prospect is
at 484 ft. There a big spurry formation
tantalises the management by keeping just
under the pay line. If it were not for that,
Adelaide would simply skip out of Bendigo.
At Charters Towers the market is still
deadly, mainly because only two local mines
—Brilliant Extended and Papuan—have got
on the div. list this year. And the Extended
has been spending more than it earned for
the last three months, so shares are down
again. A couple of other shows are brighter.
The East Mexican, which is working a hang-
ing wall section of the Day Dawn reef close
to the New Brilliant Freeholds, reports 232
tons for £2758; and the Victory from its
last crushing of 98 tons got £998. Clark’s
is hauling about 30 tons a week, so it will
soon have another crushing. The last 176
tons gave £lB2l.
* * * *
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, closed
its half-year £1938 in debt. In the six
months 3541 tons were crushed for £10,121,
or £2 17s. Id. per ton. In the deepest level
(No. 8) the crosscut has exposed three sepa-
rate reefs; but this splitting up entails
expense. A winze is down 90ft. below No. 8
level, and the reef for the last 20ft. of sink-
ing has been over 3ft. wide and is of fair
quality. The gamble some years since in
Brilliant Deeps was based on a big make
of 2oz. stone in No. 4 level, and a develop-
ment of a similar nature in No. 9 would
shake things up. It isn’t impossible. There
are 150,000 shares of ss. each, 100,000 con
tributing, with Is. uncalled.

A Good Corn
Remover.
Those who suffer from corns and hard skin
on the soles of the feet w'll find, it a great
boon to apply a little Atla Resin to the corn,
which, when applied to the corn or hard skin,
and a little covering of cotton wool on the
the top to prevent it sticking to the stocking,
will remove the corn in a day or two. The
Atla Resin seems to act by getting thor-
oughly into complete contact with the corn,
and thus being able to penetrate it, and not
to act on the surface only. It is certainly
the latest cure for these troublesome and
painful structures, and. according to all re-
ports by those who have used it, oue of the

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, October 11. 1915.
Aly Dear Arini, —
Race week had a stormy interlude on
Wednesday; but for the last day things
calmed down into one of those nondescript
occasions when furs and pneumonia bodices
parade together. Everybody seemed happy
—at the start, at any rate. The G.-G.
strolled round in his week-day clothes, as
incog, as a Governor-General who is wel-
comed with “God Save” can be. Lady
Helen’s favorite ostrich fluff was not in the
pm, his Ex. being a grass-widower for the
afternoon. The Strickland family, or one-
third of it, was out West counting the flocks
and willy-willies of the plains. Perhaps
that’s why local Society let itself go. An
impromptu cake-walk given by three fashion-
ably-dressed young things was one of the
most popular items of the day. When the
hand suddenly plunged into ragtime the girls
apparently found their feet bolting. And
they danced before the crowded grandstand
with much grace, too —one of them in par-
ticular. The apparition of a masculine
devotee of Bacchus ambling towards them
with uncertain step and a red handkerchief
iliove the maidens into entrenchments.
The Gordon girls—Dorothy and Jeanette
-were mildly sensational in freakish mus-
lins. One sister was in a Revue frock —a
Tou Ton allurement, decollete in ilie place
where the breeze blows through the top of
the lungs. There was a lively expression
about this garment which attracted the
"knots.” Sister Jeanette's white flounces,
edged with china blue, and supported by a
stagey get-up. were at odds with flimsy
lingerie that drooped below the short dolli-
sh irt.
Dead-white complexions are the thing;
but Saturday’s breeze gave some of them a
mottled-mauve effect, against which incessant
powdering was helpless.
Amongst the damsels of the neat and
spruce order was Dorothy Dangar. Her
check suit was in the almost mic-roseonic
pattern of ihe moment. A Queenslander,
Airs. Baldock. was up to the last instant in
a baggy glace garment that was tightly
shirred where ir didn't flop. The sleeves
were first cousins to a Lord Lisbon's Sunday
lingerie. Airs. Fred AlcAlaster was unob-
trusively gowned in navy blue. A few
ostrich plumes waved in the Holy of Holies
—that inner retreat in the men’s official
stand in which women are tolerated but not
encouraged. The tall Dora Alexander
ambled round in white embroidered muslin
in the wake of the recent Society Revue
crowd.
Some of the very short skirts showed quite
enough to let the spectators decide whether
the owners would stand up well in the
chorus. Hats were as small as tarts and as
large as Quaker tiles. The coatee that
waggles a small sparrow-tail came in.
Frobably it will go out with a rush, for its
loaded hem rap-raps like l’oe’s tapping fowl
uf sable hue. The buxom Enid Bayley,
quietly frocked in black, wore the round black
hat so dear to our Best People. They have
taken this pudding-basin millinery to their
hearts for some time, and wear it so deeply
embedded over one eyebrow that they all
look exactly alike.
The Allies' Consuls rested from the din of
patriotic shows during race week. Bel-
gium’s Consul AVatteeuw. the beau of the
diplomatic circle, was faithful to a pepper-
and-salt mixture in sac suiting. Like the
girls, he shows a neat ankle between the hem
of his nether garment and his shoes.
John Brown gave an eye-opening spread
at the Australia on the night the Derby
was run. For days before the invited had
been clearing their throats to sing:
John Brown's won it with Wallace Isinglass,
And his luck goes marching on.
But the owner of Wallace I. was disap-
pointed. Cetigne passed the judge’s nose
first.
Dr. Stewart McKay celebrated his racing
win of f IS, OOO with a dinner at the Aus-
tralia oil Thursday night. Three tables and
38 guests. The Tlieo Markses and Herbert
Markses and the Yivers and the Philip Alor-
t-ons and daughters and the Arthur Alac-
Arthurs and the beautiful Airs. Sep Levy
and a Aliss I’udney of whom mention is
made as “fair and frightfully smart” and
Aliss Nellie Mossong the fashionable hair-
dresser and noted good-looker. I’ve used
too many “ands” and no stops and I’m out
of breath trying to catch up with all the
beauty and fashion among the lucky 38 at
that lovely dinner. (One small roasting
Chick now costs 6s. 6d. !)
Railway-Chief Harper wound up his
three months’ holiday with a 10 days' stay
on Kosciusko. Before that he had “done”
F. and Honolulu, and come hack with a
mixed picture of wonderfully prolific vege-
tation and more wonderfully prolific politi-
cians. In Fiji the native at the moment
holds the balance of political power, and
e\ery corner has its stump orator on a
fruit-case in the midday dinner hour.
Having well braced himself up Air.
Harper has taken his coat off again at head-
quarters. Justice Harvey, with a young
law-sprig as his mate, was amongst the
Alonaro sndwhalls at the same time.
Poor little Robertson Kerr-Clark fell in
the recent fierce lighting in France. A
grandson of old Jock Robertson on mother's
side. ' Robin’s” father left him a handsome
slice of his N. S. Wales station property.
1 Ie Avas A.D.C. to Beauchamp, then on the
Rawson -staff, and later for a short time in
Islington’s menage in ALL. Finally he
showed us his pretty Irish wife during the
Chelmsfords' reign. She was Lady Beatrice
Aioore till the Australian persuaded her to
try Clark for a surname. He wasn't keeu
on soldiering in time of peace, though he
sometimes wore the fancy togs of a local
Scottish regiment.
The Bellevue Hill garden fete for sheepskin
waistcoats caught the brisk breeze that
chanced to be blowing that way on Friday.
But the Knox family, who lent their two
adjacent chalets for the affair, had some
luck. It wasn’t on the day, but the day
before, while preparations were merely pend-
ing. that the gale removed a marquee and
banged it down elsewhere in a crumpled
heap. Race-week weather was so uncertain
that a song of thanksgiving ought to have
tailed off the opening text by Lady Helen At.
Ferguson. A table of the woolly comforts,
with a man in khaki as shopman, did as
much business as a bargain-counter at a
summer sale.
“The Rustics,” who gave an outdoor
show, included two of the society mummers
in the recent “Revue” —Thelma Aladdrell
and Alonty Stephen. “The talent” was
lightly garbed in check cotton breeches and
the smock which English Hodge has (iu
moderation) east off for khaki. The new
Help. Haskett Smith, made a serious pro-
gross at the vice-regal heels. Airs. Harry
Finn and daughters Kathleen and Aloya,
with Airs. Collins, were the most attentive
waitresses the local appetite has encount-
ered for some time. Archdeacon D’Arey
Irvine's Best Hat. with wide curly sides,
attended the Best People. The flower stall,
sweet with the scent of lilac, was rushed by
all comers.
At the Conservatorium Peter Dawson is
going through the satisfactory phase known
as "an extended season.” On Friday rhe
baritone was in his best voice, and rained
encore numbers on an enthusiastic audience.
Too boisterous in the Pagliacci “Prologue”
and “Invietus,” Peter, whose lungs are like
a blacksmith’s bellows, gets very red in the
face when he lets himself go with a roar.
But his normal efforts —heard in Clay’s
"Sands o’ Dee” and Coleridge-Taylor’s
haunting “Eleanor” —are worth a long jour-
ney to hear. Annette George, the buxom
Airs. Peter, chirped pleasantly, with careful
enunciation. Ernest IToberts at the fiddle
opened the show with Frank Hutchens’s fore-
lock waving at the piano.
The Jap. parasol made a daring entry
into the gales of race-week. But it gave the
ladies in charge so much hard work to keep
it on earth that it retired for a rest-cure till
the atmosphere is less like a Balkan in-
surrection.
On the edge of starting for Randwick on
Saturday. Aliss Burdekin got a cable to say
brother Sidney Burdekin is missing some-
where at the Dardanelles.
Airs. Tony Hordern’s smart, mouse colored
coat and skirt was a mile or two away
from the freaks that were shown round the
Randwick lawn on Saturday. The breeze
had a nippy feeling in the shade, and the
Avell-tailored were It. Auntie Madden is
staying with her handsome niece.
Yvonne Charvin didn’t g t such a big
audience as her concert deserved. Bac-
night—any big race night—is a bad da'*-
for a musical show, except of the high-kick-
ing variety. If the hayseeds in town for
the Randwick party had been forewarned
that Beauty in fancy togs would make such
a brilliant display in the Town Hall, things
would have hummed. As it was. there were
too many cane seats visible in the big hall.
G.-G. Ferguson and his lady stepped
briskly up to take their places on the blue
carpet. Later on the Allies’ Consuls yawned
furtively once or twice in the same patch.
Some of the items were too heavy for an
audience which had spent the afternoon at
Randwick. The programme was mercifully
short, however. In spite of encores, the
G. was able to take a stealthy glance at
his watch at 10 p.m. and see the finish an
inch or two ahead. The pageant was the
thing. May Gibbs, who designs gum-leaf
babies for decorative'trimming, had taken
our beautiful Australian colors to her
bosom. Exquisite Christmas bells walked
with gorgeous waratahs. Flannel flowers
ami infantine wattle blossoms tumbled up
the steps to rustle into the organ seats.
Some of the wattle blossoms were so stuffed
out with crinkled paper that they rolled
along like the yolks of eggs supported bv
thin green legs. All the States were repre-
sented. N. S. Wales’ sponsors were shep-
lu rdesses in pale blue with "fleecy tunics.
'The damsels who showed us what Queens-
land really means were horned, but not
hoofed, as cattle maidens. They nobly
turned warm tan complexions, under their
horned headgear, to the glacial stare of the
great electric lights. Proceeds go to a
Battalion Comforts Fund.
Steady processions of the Wade twin-;
and pretty Marjory Hinder inspected the
progress of the latter damsel’s trousseau
. during the past few weeks. The wedding
occurred at Ashfield. The groom, who has a
brand new stethoscope, is a son of Opposi-
tion-Leader Wade. Airs. Critcliley Hinder,
the heroine’s step-mother, was easily the
best looking of the matrons, and thought-
fully garbed herself iu light and festive
drapery—quite unlike the average mother
who at smart weddings is prone to shed
tears of joy under the brim of sable millin-
ery or muffle her smile in deep shades of
royal-mourning purple. AVadc junior will
practise in Molong.
The hassocks in St. Andrew’s Cathedral
have been dusted with extra vigor of late
for the knees of wedding guests. Most of
the ceremonies have been fringed with khaki.
Ralph Pain, second-best man at the knotting
of Alabel Lewis, daughter of late architect
Mortimer Lewis, was in the usual fighting
millinery, as he goes to the Front forthwith.
The groom was Edmund A. Harris. The
Charles Alackellars, Joe Carruthers and his
wife, the Lethbridge Kings and a swarm of
friends toasted the bride’s health at
farmer’s. The moon is silvering on the
Alountains.
Next month A’iolet Wickham, eldest
daughter of 11. T. Wickham, will say the
usual thing to A. .1. Swan. Grandpa was
that Captain Wickham. R.N.. who was
Lieut.-Governor of Bananaland in the long-
ago. The old gentleman’s portrait hangs
on the walls of the Pioneer Club here. Ilis
aquiline features have been passed on to
his good-looking grandchild. Violet's young
man is a Sydney accountant.
The Lobby Horderns have a palatial suite
in Hyde Park vicinity. London. Lei)by is
going aloft on .Allies’ business as soon as
ho gets his certificate. Aleanwhile the
Steff AI eDon a Ids, formerly of this city, are
eating a cutlet or two with them. Steff's
wife and Airs. Lebby were pals in schooldays
—happy times when the Young Person ex-
changes locks of hair with her Dearest Girl.
John Dallas Campbell, only son of the
late squatter Campbell, of Condobolin, met
Dorothy Alunro, of Longueville, and a cer-
tificated marrier the other day. The bridal
plumage was tipped with a faint pink blush
—supplied by the lining. The foam of
white on top was soft as “carded wool.” as
the poet said. Or it may have been a shop-
assistant. I forget.
Killara is again burning with patriotic
fever. This time it is for Allies’ Day.
Stealthj- parties, who usually water their
lawns o’ nights, now make a bee-line for a
local hall to prepare for the great event.
The show occurs on the evening of October
23. Airs. Duncan Preston. Mrs. John Lem-
mone and Airs. A'ldworth *are chiefly respon-
sible. John will add his Pipes o' Pan to
the party.
The Jim Gordons, of Manar. have been in
toAA’ii for the races. Airs. Jim, who used
to be Aliss Bowker, is looking very plump
and comely.
From Orange came the genial Jim Dalton
to have a look at the Horse and bowl his
friends about in a big car.
A portion of Newcastle defences has been
called Fort Wallace, in memory of the late
Colonel Bob Wallace. His death, after a
painful struggle in front of the Scythe,
will be regretted here, though he was better
known in Victoria. The late Commandant
of the Southern State had his wife and only
daughter with him at the end. They got
hack from England a short time ago.
Queen A'ictoria Club is going to have a
party on October 2(1 in a sporting effort to
bag some gifts for its stall on Allies’ Da} 7 .
Barrister Bert Norris, who went a-soldier-
ing to Egypt, has been kept there on busi-
ness that mixes the law with military dis-
cipline. He is a judge-advocate or some-
thing of the kind.
Doris Buckland. a dashing country girl
from woolly Pine Ridge, is now polishing
brass work in the Coast Hospital. This is
understood to be an introduction to nursing
in Egypt.
Dr. Lucy Gullett will go to the Nile
with Constance Carson under her wing.
They are both on the trail of the damaged
kangaroo. Constance hopes to find a
brother reported missing, and unless forcibly
l>ievented slie means to help with the. nurs-
ing.
Mrs. Forster, of Ancona, Woollahra Point,
Ims a Christmas gifts afternoon for the fight-
ing Kangaroo on October l(i. From el p.m.
to <> p.m. a committee, ravenous for your
smallest offerings, will lie' in wait near the
portal. A continuous programme is threat-
ened in the drawing-room.
iMiss ( larke. a daughter of Melbourne's
chief Anglican shepherd, is amongst the race-
week visitors. Hut you mustn’t suppose
the Horse drew her. It just happened so.
If generally does.
Sister Hester Mac Lean arrived from
Kgypf on Tuesday by train. She leaves bv
rhe Moeraki for Wellington on Thursday, and
is meantime with mother at Darling Point.
In Maoriland she will resume lier job of
Inspector of Hospitals. Sister Hester was
in charge of the first batch of 50 nurses sent
from Maoriland—was a fortnight and much
tiffed in London, thence went to Alexandria,
where there are two hospitals manned by
M.L. doctors. She was afterwards at Lady
Dudley’s Convalescent Hospital Cottage at
Alexandria. Sister Mac Lean was Matron
of the Women’s Hospital in Melbourne before
she took the M.L. billet —which, by the way,
is one of the fattest in our hemisphere for
women.
Dr. Fiaschi. the 70-odd-year young medical
light and vine-grower, who is working at the
Front, stopped work for just long enough to
welcome a baby daughter. The little stranger
arrived in Pharaoh’s land, and the question
is will they call her Cleopatra or Benjamina 7
Present Mrs. Fiaschi was a nurse and is the
doctor’s second wife.
If the wastage of male life goes on at the
present rate the births of daughters will
become so unpopular that mention of them
will be censored out of the birth column,
while the arrival of the man child will lie
exploited in headlines and with noise of
loud timbrels. Boy twins "brightened the
home” (as the Americans would say) of Dr.
and Mrs. Adams, of Bose Bay. last month.
The lady is one of the Knox girls, and she
married Dr. Adams when he was on the old
Powerful man-o’-war. .Airs. Kelso King
also achieved the valuable son lately. The
stork’s beak-luggage was deposited in Mel-
bourne.
A note from Alexandria :
Colonel Watson and bis pretty wife, a Hordern
girl. have been staying- here. Mrs. Sweet-
land is helping at the No. 19 General Hospi-
tal. Airs. Fiasc-hi. wife of the Colonel, is staying at
the Majestic. Major Clongston, R.E., has been
wounded. Ilis wife has been acting as matron at
one of the convalescent homes, but has now gone to
see after her husband.
Splendid young- It. J. A. Massie is lying wounded
in the Ras-el-tin hospital. Everyone who knows
Australia’s fine bowler hopes the wound will
not interfere with his swerve.” Lieutenant Jim
Osborne is at the same hospital. He has been shot
through the groin. His mother (Airs. Fred) and
his sister Valentine passed through Port Said on
their way to England only a few days before lie
was wounded. He is doing well. Lieutenant
Johnny Newmarch, of the A.F.A., is also at Ras-el-
tin. He was shot through the back. It was a
dangerous wound, but he is getting on well. ilis
mother, father (Dr. Newmarch) and brother are all
here, and all working hard.
The small toques with high walls of tulle
survive the rush of wide gossamer headgear.
But they are too reminiscent of the trim-
ming on a ham-bone to be extra-becoming
to elderly complexions. There is a newer
species of the toque which is a rich relation
of the Dutch bonnet. I saw a pretty girl
at Randwick who had her head swallowed
tip in one of these skin-tight coverings. The
wind couldn’t stir it, though it shook the
large silk side whiskers which were like
the rounded arms of a windmill.
Flounces can be borne with equanimity
if you remember that you can’t sit down on
• hem without crumpling up their mid-Vic-
torian beauty. But when they’re scalloped
from hem to waist the lady inside looks as
if she ought to wilt away on a, horsehair
soft with a. white antimacassar as a hack-
ground.
The Polish Belief Fund’s lion. sec.. .Miss
Czaykowska, remarks in a soft whisper that
the new depot is in Hamilton-street, City.
Cases of garments for the shivering Polish
infant are being rushed thence to their des-
tination.
Laurence Godfrey Smith is slill pegging
away in London. Ilis’frantic desire to per-
sonally meet the enemy was turned down for
lack of the physique that thrives in the
trenches. So he helps the Censor to un-
ravel foreign correspondence.
The Town Hall cellar, which performs
many useful purposes in war time, will be
a depot for the receipt of custom on Flower
Day. Don’t start, Arini —it’s only another
of them! It falls on October 15. Any kind
of produce will he welcomed by Mrs. Munro,
the lady behind the counter.
Yours affectionately,
VAN DORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, October 11, 1915.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Despite murder and sudden death, the
annual insanity began at Caulfield on Satur-
day with the Guineas. State-Governor
Stanley showed that it was a less official
occasion than usual by appearing in tweeds
with a gent, help or two but no womenfolk.
Mostly they kept away from the official
crate and went looking for winners as ter-
riers hunt rats. The women for the most
part were nearly worried to death over what
to wear. After a week of biting winds, the
weather had turned on a dusty north wind
and a hot sun, thereby putting un a joke on
the furry rich, who staggered about like
asses in the skins of bears and such. The
encumbrances were far too valuable to leave
about, and chauffeurs had mostly lost them-
selves before the fool-wearers discovered
that they were likely to perish of their
armor. But the ones who had taken a
sporting risk and backed summer were
almost as badly off with their fashionable
footwear, which is “just too sweet” when
you try it on at home, but more like Hades
when you try to walk in it on a hot day.
The Fenner girl, in very full skirts,
threatened to topple forward at any minute.
.Mrs. Waters was in bright blue foulard and
spots, with a saucy veil hanging from her
black sailor hat, yo ho! But the wife of one
of the Baillieux, in black taffetas beautifully
shirred, was really the smartest racegoer
visible. The Herbert Power dame was
arrayed in black glace, while the clever
Brennan lawyer-girl wore tricky full skirts
of white cloth. It was joyous to see fat,
middle-aged dames in full “stuff” skirts and
fat sailor hats. The slim young ones in
silk frills suggested lampshades. One slender
girl had her gathered skirt held round her
hips with a cord. She made me think of a
nice umbrella that was stolen from me years
ago by a cat with green eyes. Another
extraordinary vision was in paddy-green
glace elaborately flounced. A baffling veil
hid her face. Mrs. “Alawa” Buchanan
looked fully six feet tall in a layered out-
fit of dark grey. Actress Eugenie Duggan
had on the neatest oufit of navy blue and a
small, putty-colored hat like a half-baked
tart.
Young Atherstone Archer, a grandson of
the late Judge Gaunt, has had a yarn with
George V. It happened this way. Young
Archer went to the Dardanelles as a private
in Colonel Wanliss’s command, which was
part of the First Expedition. At the Front
he was badly wounded in the head and sent
to England. George V. came visiting at
Ilarefield Park Hospital one day. and said
something polite to the Australians there
about a distinguished Australian —Rear-
Admiral Ernest Gaunt, a son of the Judge.
Atherstone’s convalescence in the hospital and
his relationship to the Admiral were made
known to the Presence, and H.M. did the rest
while the reporters took a copious note of
the occurrence. Mrs. Oakley Archer, the lad’s
mother, has for many years been principal
of our Trinity College Hostel, where the
woman-’Varsity students stay. The soldier’s
sister is doing the science course at the Uni-
versity.
Baronet Clarke’s pretty daughter Aimee,
otherwise “Possie,” is about to pair off with
a young British officer by the name of
Gerard. The gossips say he matches his
bride-elect in good looks, wears the proper
I ang-the-expense air, and has a sporting
( fiance of wearing the family title some day
when all the wars are over. Father Rupert
will probably get away from his military job
to hand his girl over.
Osborne House, Geelong, which was our
first Naval College, has been turned into a
military hospital for returned wounded.
Latest news of its first commandant, Cap-
tain Chambers, is about his ship, the Rox-
burgh. being torpedoed “somewhere in the
North Sea,” and he being given a Dread-
nought instead. Meantime the tall and
beauteous Mrs. Bertram Chambers, so well
remembered for her remarkable frocking and
yellow head, anxiously awaits her lord in
London, where she is flatting in Cavendish-
street. Her small sister, Miss Bertrand,
who came to Australia on a short visit and
remained a year, has changed her name since
returning to England. She married Lieut.
Archibald Monk, one of the Naval College
staff, who now rocks in the cradle of the
North Sea.
The solemn boom of the “Dead March”
reminded Melbourne last Saturday that
(’olonel Wallace was going to his long rest.
The dead officer will be missed, for he was
full of tact and a gifted arbitrator. A
military “inquiry” in his hands became
rather a pleasant function, and the result was
generally satisfactory.
The Monty Langdon widow, whose only
son Leslie has been posted as missing since
the famous Gallipoli landing, has been taking
a course of mountain breezes at Braemar,
with daughter Dorothy Campbell, who was
on the sick list for a time.
Mrs. Fairclough, of Toorak, is another
mother who is waiting and hoping for news
of a missing son. Her handsome boy Bob
was given a commission on the field, only to
vanish a day or so later. Jack Tovell, a
Brighton boy and an embryo barrister, has
not been seen by his mates since that day at
Sari Bair.
Helen Sexton, M.D., who was among the
first flight of women doctors in Australia,
and has been given the management of a
hospital in France, wears the title “Major” !
Our Trinity College has the gentle warrior’s
name on its war-service roll.
Frank Derham, a son and junior partner
of Tom Derham, of the ancient Melbourne
law-firm, has. a job as Major in Lieut.-
Colonel’s Grimwade’s new field-artillery
command. Two young brothers of Mrs. Der-
ham, Colin and Harold Bowden, are helping
to keep the guns tidy in the same brigade.
Their dad is John Bowden, who for a time
wrestled with Conservatism on the commit-
tee of the V.R.C. Captain Norman Derham,
one of the military censors (groans), belongs
to the same totem as the artillery major.
Presbyterian-parson Frank Rolland, who
is just the shepherd for the job, has put on
the chaplain’s stars and gone to Gallipoli.
For some time previously he had been toiling
Noorat, a space in the Western District
vineyard which is mostly sheep and scenery
and squattages owned by the Black family.
Justice Higgins’s only son, Mervyn, now
at Gallipoli, has a blend in his veins which
should not fail him at a pinch. He is
descended from an Irish grand-dad, that long-
deceased Baptist-parson Higgins who founded
the Australian family; on the other side his
grandpa was a Scotchman, fine old Principal
Morrison, of the Geelong Grammar School’s
early days. Young Higgins is a lieutenant in
the war-scarred Bth Light Horse.
Norton Grimwade lost a 20-year-old
son in the recent fighting. The boy was the
second of three, and the other two are busy
in the field. The eldest, Fred, has just got
his aviator’s certificate in England, and
Lionel, the youngest, is a middy on one of
the North Sea giants.
Three Maori officers. Captain Dansey,
Lieutenant Hiroti and Lieut. Hetet, who
returned by the Don’t-ask-me, caused a mild
sensation in Melbourne during the few days
they were being shown round. Mrs. Manson
and other Maoriland women gave a tea-party
at the Mia Mia, and the Athenaeum Club
blew up with a dinner.
Maybe to square accounts, Angliss, M.L.C.,
has fitted up a white and red motor-ambu-
lance and handed it over to the Defence
people. Colonel Cuscaden, acting chief mili-
tary sawbones, said a few fervent words of
thanks.
Mrs. Waters is packing her clothes, her
children and the nurses in readiness for a
forward move to Egypt. The Colonel hus-
band has written the glad news that he is
to be for some time at or near the Canal,
and the whole family is to advance on
Cairo. Sister Mrs. Walsh is in London,
where her children are devouring chops at
tenpence each, and generally making them-
selves expensive. Therefore the Walsh
menage intends to migrate to Egypt also,
and junction with the Waterses.
There is going to be a big jump in the
recruiting figures after harvest. Half the
Mallee boys are just holding on till they get
the precious wheat in, and then they’ll see
about getting the Hun out. As for this
harvest, by the way, it is still too early to
talk of records. October is a critical month,
and thus far it has been exceptionally dry.
Miss Ethel Hart, matron of the Found-
ling Hospital at Richmond, is engaged to be
married to Claude Felstead, a one-time golf
champion. * Claude, who is a son of the
Felstead. is at present trying to grow wheat
and things in Westralia. His farming
partner has enlisted, and when the coming
harvest is over, Claude will also enlist —but
not before he marries his Ethel. The
romance has been short and sweet. Miss
Hart was surfing with sister Mrs. Percy
Cook at Peterboro when Claude came down
to the surf and saw the Junoesque girl, who
towers nearly six feet in her bathing sandals.
And he knew at once without telling that she
must be his little tootums for ever.
Vera, the Frank Madden daughter with
the dreamy smile, is booked for a wedding
with a blue and gold-laced naval officer on
the , by name of Johnston. The
romance is popular with both families.
The Sam Warnocks are in mourning for
the youngest of their trio of daughters. The
bereaved mother, for whom everyone is feel-
ing very sorry, is an elder sister of the good-
loojking Mrs. Henry Cornish.
Dr. Hope and his wife have flown home
to Australia after a long three years’ flight
round the world. Unlike most travellers
they first “did” Australia from one end to
another, and then went further afield.
When they had spurned the whole round
earth with their tyres, they exchanged their
faithful chariot for £2UO and sailed home.
Mrs. Hope is furnishing a flat while her
husband is sorting out his sheep on a
N.S.W. station. The Hopes’ last English
rest was taken at Folkestone, within hearing
of the big gnus in France. A passing Zep-
pelin dropped a bomb in the garden of a
neighboring clergyman, and they left
hurriedly amid a shower of flowers and
weeds for Australia and peace.
Christmas tobacco has been rolling in plen-
tifully for the soldiers. But there is a
scarcity of pipes to burn it in. Some eager
matrons lately -ailed a meeting with the
intimation, “Come and bring your pipe (as
a gift).” The little function progressed
nicely in the tea-and-talk method natural to
the Sassiety brand of worker until a she-duke
with an arrogant nose rose in her silk stock-
ings and yawned: “Ai suppose clay pipes
will do for them?” Some of these absurd
women cannot rid themselves of the hallu-
cination that in making presents to the
troops they are doling out charity to uni-
formed paupers.
Frank Hardyman (secretary) and Mrs.
Major James (chairwoman) of the Over-
seas Club want to send out a whole ship-
load of bottled vegetables to the Dardanelles
immediately. The trench-dwellers, it
appears, are being attacked by something
like the distressing complaint known to
Australian bushmen as “Barcoo Rot.” The
only remedy, it is alleged, is a vegetable diet,
and the Overseas women are throwing down
their knitting and collecting preserved vege-
tables as fast as they can. Pass the pickled
cabbage, please!
There will be some fun for Sassiety dar-
lings in Cup week, even if it has to be dis-
guised with Red Cross badges. Mrs. Harry
Emmerton gives an At Home on Monday
evening, November 1, at her South Yarra
place, in the midst of a f@te and cafe clian-
tant in aid of the Red Cross. Visitors must
have the usual invitation pasteboard (larg-
est size and gilt-edged), but they will also
pay seven-and-sixpence to get inside. Amy
Castles, sister Dolly and brother George have
all offered their voices, and John Amadio
and Harold Elvins will be among the others.
Now for Adelaide: —
The University conferred degrees the other day,
and most of the men recipients were in khaki. An
exception to the rule was Dr. Bevan, the Congrega-
tional cherub, who took his D.D. in America and
his IiU.B. in London in 1866 ; so he is more than
a promising boy.
Dr. Bollen, of Woodville, is off to the Front,
wearing the major’s crown. The Moldavia took with
her E. W. Hayward, who is bound for Egypt’s Red
Cross, and one of the Talbot Smith sons.
News is through that Lieut. M. A. Davies has been
killed in France. His mother was a daughter of the
late' Maurice Salom, a one-time legislator, and his
father is a brother of Major Karri Davies, of W.A.
Every second woman you meet has a billycan in
one hand and a collection of small parcels in the
other. And she invariably wants to know why the
first woman wasn't carrying another billy and
another set of parcels.
Artist Will Ashton has sold his picture, “The
Luxembourg Gardens,” to the trustees of the N.S.W.
Gallery. This is the eighth of his canvases to find
a place in an Australian national collection.
The Navy League has arranged a special fneet-
ing on Trafalgar Day (October 21) to celebrate the
work done by the Allied fleets since the outbreak of
the war. The triumph is worth celebrating, and his
Ex. will be on hand to help do it.
The Chamber of Manufactures is enthusiastic about
the Minister of Industries’ scheme for establishing a
special department to afford facilities for research
work —that is, finding out how the enemy did it.
The idea is that a properly-equipped laboratory
should be set up, under the direction of a chemist,
and that experiments—which are often nothing more
than bad smells —be made with great care. It is
one of those noble, necessary, dull subjects in which
you probably .are not interested, so I won’t tell you
any more about it.
Brewster Jones’s symphony concert in aid of the
Red Cross Fund at the Town Hall on Thursday even-
ing deserved a better attendance than it got. But
what can you do! The Law won’t allow us enthusi-
asts to spring at wayfarers from behind and rush
them into the vacant chairs by the scruff of the neck.
The National Service meeting in the Town Hall
might have been better attended, and might have
been the text for more enthusiastic speeches. The
same thing might be said of every function bar the
Last Judgment. But that will, I understand, be
Compulsory Service.
Some- time ago, when Melbourne thought
the war would smash the Cup of 1915, the
Brighton matrons began to scheme a big
carnival bazaar for race-time. Now the Cup
is going to run over as usual, and the pro-
ject has got on their nerves. It begins on
Derby Day, and must struggle along as best
it can while all the State is out at Fleming-
ton. If you’re not going racing, attend it,
and you’ll probably see one prominent horse-
owner’s wife wringing her gloved hands.
A well-known sheep-farmer, whose wife
and daughters are working their fingers to
the bone over Red Cross sewing, is giving
his front teeth to the Cause. He takes
possession of the hotel bar in his township,
and when the thirsty visitor drifts in he
lures the stranger into a bet —he (the sheep-
man) will back himself to bite a tliripny bit
in halves. Practice has made the hero per-
fect, and he wins every time. I suppose
it’s magnificent and all that sore of thing,
but it makes my teeth ache to think of it.
It is killing, the way the Sassiety charity-
queen works her wonders to perform. A
bunch of matrons are organising a Patriotic
Dinner Party (hear, hear!), which is to
happen at the Savoy just after the Caul-
field Cup. The original idea of asking only
seven-and-sixpence a head has been squashed
flat and the feeding price fixed at a guinea.
Of course the dinner will have to be good,
and the caterers can’t afford to work for
nothing. But, never mind ! No doubt the
Red Cross will get something out’ of it. If
the guns fail us we will chew our way to
victory with serviettes tucked under ’ our
chins. How it must comfort the warrior
wounded to think “Somewhere at home Nice
People are over-eating for me!”
Veronica Ronald from Hay, Caused a
social sensation they say—No, no, no! I
forgot that it wasn’t a Limerick competi-
tion ! Anyhow, Veronica alighted at Mel-
bourne as a prelude to a long holiday, and
put up at the Alexandra Club in such glit-
tering style that this war-stricken city
dropped its collection box and cheered till
its hat was crooked. Visions like Veronica,
as she appears when in full sail, are very
scarce these times, and we felt much better
for sighting her.
. “Block” promenaders on Saturday morn-
mg w/re treated to an inspiring sight when
a well-known and dressy St. Kilda matron
burst’ into view with a live and uncomfort-
able-looking native bear, decorated with a
large pink bow, in her arms. The crowd
surged round the lady as though she were a
dogfight or a damaged motor-car, but she
contrived to furnish an imitation of a per-
son wondering in a composed sort of way
what all the bother is about.
Partly owing to the inclusion of over-ripe
articles of food, and partly for another
reason, workers have been engaged
unpacking and repacking the 20.0(1(1
billies-for-soldiers at the Alexandra Club.
Unchained cheese, fruit, portions of ham,
cooked chickens and similar highly explo-
sive goods were stowed in some of the early
billies —possibly under the impression that
they were to go only as far as Broad-
meadows. A complete examination followed
as a matter of course.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

MRS. GRUNDY IN TOPHET.
“D.D.” : In Colac district (Vic.) I struck
a case of a lad of 14 who, it was given as gospel,
milked 18 cows in a non-stop run of an hour and a
half. The cows were not picked, but taken as they
were bailed up. If anyone can put me on to his
better I’ll take the wonder on forthwith.

Wandering over the roof of the world in search of a
location for a railroad from Nowhere to the Next
■id foi the purpose of exploiting nothing more
tangible than the ever-confiding shareholder, I struck
a one grave under the shadow of a beetling crag.
(Hie crags don’t beetle much in Bolivia, as a
general thing, and that’s why I make a point of
mentioning the circumstance.) The last resting-
place was marked by a fantastic cross painted or
daubed in red ochre on the side of the crag Th it
and nothing more. My Quichua boys said the local
equivalent to dunno when I questioned them, but
they thought it was the grave of one of (he many
prospectors who had perished in that arid wilder-
ness I pushed on to a little Indian village where
the hospitable padre, a full-blooded Quichua, put
me up for the night, and after a dinner of roast
llama-meat and a rather fishy omelette of flamingo
eggs and a bottle of vino moscatel, and when we
had lighted our cigarillos of native tobacco rolled
m maize husks, I expressed my sympathy for the
luckless prospector who lay under the crag The
padre put me right. “No, Sefior, you are entirely
wrong. Ihe grave you saw was that of a bad man,
a bandido a hunter of the vicuna and the chin-
chilla, and he died from a surfeit of vicuna heads,
and Maria Motive! cursing God and the Holy
Saints, for which may he receive pardon!” The
vicuna is a cross between a fallow deer and a
t wart camel, with a tremendous leaning towards the

fL At Motion near Gennanton
* lle y e ' dl two notorious men were
shearing as pen-mates. One was
the Derwent Nugget; the other
Power, the bushranger. Both had
served long terms of imprison-
ment. The Nugget’s little trouble
was the murder of a picker-up
and tar-boy who had goaded him
beyond control. The Nugget
plunged the sheep-shears into
the youngster’s side. Power had
only been out a couple of years
after doing a score for highway
robbery. He was the protege of
two wealthy maiden ladies in
Wangaratta (Vic.), and supple-
mented their bounty by a little
shearing. When he would talk of
his exploits he always maintained
that Ned Kelly put his (Power’s)
haunts away to the police, and
so enabled them to capture him
while sleeping. His career was
picturesque. He never shot any-
one even in circumstances in
which others probably would have
been tempted to do it.

him some stinging-tree leaves. Then all he will
need to do to cure his egg-eating hound is to rub
a few samples of the fowl industry with the herb and
return the eggs to the nests. Incidentally an old
bushman I know swears that the leaves are a cure
for rheumatism. Any abo. tried it?

HENPECK (who has been sent to enlist): "I-er-sommetimes smoke a cigarette,

“Coot”: Several country districts in Vic-
toria are complaining of the increase of wombats,
and the Assembly spent some hours recently dis-
cussing whether the animals would take poison'. Mr.
McKenzie asserted that wombats would not take
poison, whereupon the officers of the Lands Depart-
ment retorted that they took it readily. In 1913
near Mudgee (N.S.W.) the wombats became such a
pest that the Pastures Protection Board offered 10s.
a head on the assumption that they were difficult
to kill or capture. In a few weeks the amazed
Board had 1300 claims sent in, and had to cancel
the bonus offer. Recently, at Mount Feathertop
(\ic.), my horse was stopped by a wombat stretched
across the track. Worn, wouldn’t move, either,
until I got off and prodded him with a stick.
Is it specimens of Australians

“Leo Leal-” : I don’t know how ’roos fared
ioi moisture in Westralian droughts, but I can
give some first-hand information re birds in water-
less country. In 1902 there was about as much water
in the far N.W. Victorian mallee as can be seen on
the face, of the moon. Yet small birds lived
through it in apparently normal numbers. Emus
and ’roos made for the Murray or down south.
Some birds can, I knowq do without water as long
as the dews are heavy, but some of the honey-eaters
and others are never found far from a bird pub.
Noticing that for several evenings they were flying
in a particular direction, I followed, anti came to a
bull-mallee with a hole in a projecting limb, around
which dozens of honey-eaters, caterpillar-eaters,
wood-swallows and other small fry were flying.
Investigation proved that the tree was hollow-, with
the lower end plugged up with mud. In this natural
reservoir water had collected during the rains, and
the birds used it as required. As evaporation was
negligible and leakage unknown, the birds had an
assured supply. Since then I’ve heard of other
similar cases. Moral for the thirst-stricken bloke
in the back country—keep one eye on the birds.
Ino ’: Forty-five years ago quanclong
trees were plentiful near Eugowra (N.S.W.). The
largest fruit that I ever saw east of Forbes would
be about as big as a small walnut, the stones
inside the fruit being' about the size of marbles.
Inside the stone is a kernel, white, solid and to the
taste much like raw mutton suet. The fruit that
grew down the Lachlan was much larger and better
in every way. It made good pies and fair jam,
and was quite a treat as a fruit where fruit was a
rarity at that time. I think the tree is about ex-

t;inet now. Certainly there are none about Eugowra.
The bush fires destroyed the older trees, and stock
ate the seedlings as fast, as they grew. The largest
of the fruit I ever saw or heard of was about the
size of a hen egg, with; a stone as big as a walnut.
But specimens like that were rare.

THE BIRTHDAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
" <ll I remember when we first
Resolved to mark Brown’s natal day
By drinks, wherein his splendid thirst
Would have full scope to frisk and play,
Like a fat mermaid in the surf
Before the bold sun comes that way.
We fixed a list of pleasures sweet,
filled with delight and sopping wet,
So that in afterdays we’d meet
And look back with a mild regret
On this delightful night of ours,
And smile and sigh but ne'er forget.
Biown when in drink's a gentleman,
But when he’s sober he's a boi;e ;
So we arranged a splendid plan—
We’d start the jag at half-past-four,
1 hat when fond night embraced the sky
Brown's meaner self would nag no more!
We drank his health in whisky neat,
And he drank ours in bottled beer ;
Great, envious crowds stopped in the street
To see us drink and hear us cheer.
A cabman with a monstrous nose
Kept driving us from There to Here.
Shocked by the sound of falling beers
The sun blushed red and sank from si grit.
Said Jones with glee: “The mean cow fears
That if he stays we’ll make him tight, "
And there would be an awful row
If the old bloke stayed out all night.”
AVe let him go. We didn't mind.
If he was such a flaming nark,
Well, blast him! He would dam’ soon find
How much we all preferred the dark. j
Smith struck a match to take his place
Oh I we were having such a lark !
So we went on from hour to hour
Like large, intoxicated bees,
Flitting about from flower to flower,
A-drinking stout and eating cheese,
And scoffing steak in Dago joints,
With waitresses upon our knees!
Brown thanked us all in Market-street;
We shook his hand in Martin-place,
Where Jones was very indiscreet—■
He wept to see the cabman’s face.
(His nose annoyed him, so he said—
It seemed a glaring red disgrace.)
Then we beheld a fearful thing:
Ihe earth and skv went reeling round ;
Each paving-stove began to sing,
And yelled aloud without a sound;
Great buildings all about us leapt,
ihe cab-horse left us with a bound,
The moon was walking hand in hand,
The stars were playing twos-and-threes*
And over all the silent land
A brown tide rose by slow degrees—
It flooded out the oyster shops,
And lapped a|pund the policemen's knees.
It rose and rose and rose apace.
AVe greeted it with shouts of glee,
And showered prawn-shells on its face.
And then, too late, we turned to flee—-
It rose, and buried all the world,
And left us drowned beneath the sea.
Until in a tumult of hiccoughs and laughter,
It hurled us into the Morning After.

THE illustration shows in miniature the finish of the remarkable Rawson-
Moody All-Steel Fence. It is the only first-class fence in the world to-day.
Give your attention to the straining-posts. They require a depth of only
two feet. You do hot require to sink holes to considerable distances. The
straining posts are the strongest in the world to-day. They are made of high-grade
steel. See the patent slots, which allow the wires to strain through either way,
automatically helping in the self-locking movement which is a chief feature of the
Rawson-Moody fence. Take notice of the anchor-like stays and feet, which take
an octopus-like grip of the ground, giving tremendous stability and strength. The
standards and droppers, which can be fitted to a five-wire fence in as many seconds,
are also a wonderful patent. The wire-straining ratchets, another Rawson-Moody
patent, is a clever feature of the fence. One goes to each wire, and by its use
ties, staples, clips and wedges are done away with. The weight of this fence is
only three tons to the mile, as compared with 12 to lb tons of other fences. A
man and a boy can erect a quarter of a mile a day. Above all, the fence gives a
finely-finished appearance. A few chains enclosing the approaches to your home-
stead, and enclosing the house paddocks, will make you proud-of your property.
This can be done at small cost and little labor. Write for particulars of this
all-steel fence. The straining posts, standards and droppers, which are sold
separately, are made so that any good standard fencing-wire may be used.

She Darkened Her Grey Hair
A Society Lady Darkened Her Grey Hair
and Stimulated Its Growth by a
Simple Home Process.
She Tells How She Did It.
A well-known society lady who darkened
her prey hair by a simple home process, made
the following statement: “Any lady or gentle-
man can darken their grey or faded hair,
stimulate its growth and make it soft and
glossy with this simple recipe, which they can
mix at home. To a half-pint of water add
loz. of bay rum, 1 small box of Orlex Com-
pound and \o'/., of glycerine. These ingredi-
ents can be purchased at any chemist’s at
very little cost. Apply to the hair every other
day until the grey hair is darkened suffici-
ently. then every two weeks. This mixture
relieves scalp troubles and is excellent for
dandruff and falling hair. It does not stain
the scalp, is not sticky or greasy and does not
rub off. It will make a grey-haired person
look 10 to 20 years younger.” [y

"Pick : Certain breeds of monkey-vine
that festoon with fancy arches the fairy- bowers of
jungle-land are water-bags which in drought have
furnished liquid for many a billycan. The experi-
enced bushie with a thirst seeks a rough-barked
vine, and at high-reach mark makes an incision
in the central pipe of the vegetable hawser. lie
then severs the vine low and holds the William
beneath. Air pressure does the rest. The wattr
that trickles abundantly forth, if the right vine has
been selected, has a somewhat resinous tang, but
tile tea brewed from it is preferable to a can of
emptiness at “joe” time.
Lillybungev : Billjim, the jumbuob
baiber, has a vocabulary of his own, which is
ia t hoi mystifying to a “chummie” in shearing sheds.
hen applying for employment he invariably in-
quires if he can get “a pen,” “a stand” or “a cut.”
In a shed where the harboring is done by machinery
he always alludes to his handpiece as “a bog-eye.”
This is from its likeness to the lizard of that name,
a thick, dumpy fellow six or eight inches long,
with a blunt head and tail and big scales like a
crocodile’s down his back. The combs and cutters
aie invariably “the tod-,” and when comb and
cutter are screwed on the handpiece Billjim reckons
he has “loaded-up his bog-eye.” The old-timer who
only barbers with the shears is “queer” or “cranky,”
and his implements of destruction are “the blades”
of “the tongs.” The unfortunate quadrupeds he gets
his bit of dough for “peeling” arc “the woolics”
when he’s polite; when he’s not polite it would take
a column to say what he says they are.
_ * .. * *
Dinku m : The most elaborate— at any
rate, the noisiest—funeral ceremonies held by the
extinct Wirrulumba abos. were those following the
death of a dingo. They regarded that animal with
the most singular superstition, looking upon it as
one of their ancestors and in some way associated
with their origin and destiny—a belief, I think,
unknown elsewhere on the Australian continent. The
death of the dingo was the occasion for universal
mourning, and the Icidjee (wake) held over a chief
was nothing in comparison with the noisy send-off' a
wild-dog got.
Put O Riot”: Somebody or other asks
(B. 9 9/'l5) for something to block a dog from
eating eggs. Dose an egg or two with cayenne
pepper. Pierce the fruit as for blowing, half blow,
and season to taste. If the mongrel lives, he is
permanently cured. If he dies, he is cured still
more permanently. The only other remedy I know
is wire-netting*. Not for the dog, for the eggs. For
fear of the eggs becoming morbid through loneliness,
enclose the hens also. I presume that What’s-his
name wishes to act in advance of the egg-laying,
so if lie nets the hens he's right.
“Mulga’*: There’s one all-round fine Aus-
tralian tree that is overdue for'mention, and that is
the heefwood of Bananaland. When seasoned it has
no equal for lightness and durability, and when
worked up the grain and polish of it are equal to
anything the ■ sun smiles on. I know of several
horses that are being kept alive on the leaves of it
during the present drought, and it does not bind
them up like mulga, wilga or belah.' Bullockies in
Queensland will have nothing else but beefwood for
yokes if it is obtainable. And no wonder: for one
ox-pilot near the Balonne has had a set of beef-
wood yokes in continual use for over 20 years.
THE VICOUS CIRCLE.
“Rap, where did per get the money fer that lawyer cove gettin' yer orf knocking the
swell bloke on the 'cad?"
“Knocked another swell bloke on the ’ead."
ONE BETTER.
BAGMAN : “Prime Minister bin come this way next week, Billy. Big pfeller boss, eh?”
BILLY: "I dunno — I bin king all about this place.”
“E..T.G.”: Some time back I mentioned
that the so-called Afghan had a playful habit of
sewing dead goatskins on to live camel skins.
" liar coo” (B. 19/S/’l5) scoffed at me—which shows
what a fat lot he knows. Just 10 days after his
misinformation appeared I happened to be in
Duchess (Q.). A team of 4 0 camels, including
eight babies, was on its way to be loaded with copper
ore. The mother of one of the infants was lame.
It also had a raw wound on each side of the back-
bone. Now, it would have been easy to strap a
goat-skin over these wounds, but Abdul believed in
making sure the baggage on top could not slip. So
lie had the pieces of goat-skin sewn on. I repeat, in
“Barcoo’s” car, the goat-skins were sewn on. About
a million flies were getting drunk on a little blood
that trickled from underneath. Finally, as a
guarantee of good faith, if “Barcoo” will forward
his address, I’ll pass it on to the first Afghan I see
looking for an animal to skin.
“Pick”: I can enlighten “F.11.R.” (B.
16/9/’l5) re bark-stripping. The long, stringy tree
he found peeled to the branches had been handled
by a blackfellow. Binghi is an expert at the game.
With a tomahawk he rings his first sheet of bark
top and bottom; then using the upper ring for
toe-hold he rings again at arms-length overhead.
This manoeuvre he repeats until as far aloft as he
wishes to strip. He then shoves off the sheets
successively as he descends. The marvel about the
performance is the extraordinary length of time he
can support himself with his toes.
* * * *
“Mulga”: I’ll nominate the ironwood tree
of Western Queensland to be the hardest cutting,
the heaviest and most useless timber in the bush,
lhe axe that has stood the test of an old man iron-
wood should be sent to the Bushwhackers’ Museum
as a curiosity’'. The wood is too heavy to be used
for rails, while to put it up for posts would be
issuing an invitation to all the white ants in the
district to come to lunch. If it had an asbestos
covering it could not be harder to ignite, but it
has this to be said of it—once well alight it burns
with tl\e fierceness of seven furies.
* * * *
“Mulga”: What’s the highest tally of
posts known to have been put up by any wild
colonial boy with bar and shovel, or with shovel
alone, in a day? I heard of a toiler the other side
of Sunset who had put up 400 in spinifex country,
and was still going strong when the shovel caught
alight. But, disqualifying him for negligence, I’ll
give a start with 217 scored by “Bluey” Watson
in mulga country on Wild Horn Plains in the
Bollon district. He did that in a bush-whacker’s
day—from crowup to sundown.
“Mulga’’: On the sandy plains out Far
West (N.S.W.) there is a weed which Black Bro-
ther calls “pitchery,” and which he uses as a
substitute for opium—or “mooki,” as he calls it.
He claims that it has all the attributes of the
poppy drug, and I certainly know that after a
week's chewing of pitchery the swab is just about
as useful for work as three-eighths of a corpse.
Lake George, which faded off the map of
X S. Males 20 years ago, is putting in a reappear-
ance. Twenty-five .years back it was a shallow
puddle about 25 miles long and eight broad, teeming
with fish and game. Then the inflow failed to make
up for the loss through evaporation and soakage, and
the area grew less and loss. While this was taking
place great hauls of fish were made; they only had
to bo scooped up at last, so closely were they packed
in the shrinking - waterholes. Finally, as the mois-
ture showed no signs of returning-, the Lands Depart-
ment leased the basin, which became a fine pastur-
age. Now the water is spreading rapidly, and the
Fisheries Department is thinking of getting to work
to restock the pool. After the previous holiday it
was nature that did the restocking, but it was a bit
of a dawdler.
* * * *
“Tiger ’: Can any Abo. tell me a profes-
sion with more aliases than the swagman's? Here
are a few: “Waltzin’ Matilda,” “paddin’ the hoof,”
“travellin’,” “humpin’ the bluey,” “on the wallaby,”
“paddlin’ the canoe,” “on the track,” “chasin’ the
sunset, “followin’ the luck,” “carryin’ the swag.”
“on the camel-track,” “huntin’ the mirage,” “hoof-
in’ it,” “doin’ the circuit” (this of the blokes who
turn up regularly every three months or so), “cart-
in’ the sausage-roll,” “humpin’ the plunder,”
“trampin’,” “lookin’ for work” (this bloke is often
clever at avoiding it), “leavin' the dead hopes,”
playin’ a lone hand,” “followin’ the sheds.” Onlv
met one of the profesh who added the final “g” to
his words, and he declared his sister was wife of
the Earl of Beauchamp: “Ai am transpoarting mai
dunnaige across the fields looking for a—er —suitable
resting-place.” lie found it, too —or two years of
it, anyhow.
* * * *
“Lou” : A neat little sbrub of the West
Queensland downs country is one the niggers call
the emu apple-tree. It is a small affair, about 4ft.
tall, with a clean stem and a small mushroom-
shaped tuft of dark green foliage. It is evergreen,
and in summer bears a pink-and-white-slcinned berry’
about the size of a large cherry, the flesh white.
I’ve seen the “flatnoses” eating this when very
thirsty. I sampled it myself once; it tasted like
quinine.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Over the mountain and valley and plain,
Warmed by the sunshine or soaked by the rain,
Moving on slowly by dark or by day,
Some dressed in black, but most of 'em "ray,
Heels in the air, with their heads hanging down,
Our friends the wild rabbits are going to town.
Cursed in the past as a virtueless pest,
Hailed now by many as meat of the best;
trapped in their wide-spreading country domain,
Dragged to the city by hurrying train ;
Heels in the air, with their heads hanging down,
Our friends the wild rabbits arc going to town.
Looked at with scorn by the trappers outback,
Hailed as a blessing by many who lack
t ash to buy scarcer and higher-priced meat,
Off to be hawked through each alley and street;
Heels in the air, with their heads hanging down,
Our friends the wild rabbits are going to town.
Taken by science and stiffened with cold,
Down in the liner, close packed in her hold,
Leaving the land where they ate tip the grass.
Out through the Heads in their thousands they pass.
Heels in the air, with their heads hanging down,
Our friends the wild rabbits are going to town.
Over the seas to a far-away shore,
Millions may come, but they'll want many more ;
Passed by inspectors, and branded as good,
Who there despises friend Bunny as food! •
lleels in the air. with their heads hanging down.
Our friends the wild rabbits are welcomed in town.
And off to the trenches, where bay'not and gun

The hungry brown soldiers who strive in the fray—
Hats oft when you see, with their heads hanging down,

Miss May Matthews, a pleasant, soft-
voiced Labor organiser who talks politics
with a straight hat, is one of the four
women who intend to have a try for the
three Senate seats that will need filling in
N. S. Wales shortly. In addition to the
intrepid four, 30 Labor men have nomi-
nated ; and David Watson, who is one of
the three retiring senators, will probably be
available again ; so it’s a long way to Tip-
perary and an uncompleted journey for
most of the starters. Miss Matthews is a
member of the central executive, and has
been doing organising work for the Federal
find State parties for about nine years—
wljich is a fairly long apprenticeship. Once
at Molong, back in 1910, she acted as
chairlady for Attorney-General Hughes. She
has only once been asked to leave a hall,
aqd that was for contradicting a whirling
Liberal sister who ventured to tell a hand-
fed audience that the Labor party was
bursting to give lunatics votes! It wasn't
worth while staying in a meeting like that,
anyhow.
“Trot” on a neglected industry :
AVhy is the writing of bellowdramas not a more
flourishing Australian industry ? Look at the good
stuff going to waste every day ! Here is a case re-
ported in the newspapers of a man so distracted by
receiving one of Holman’s “letters to young men”
about the duty of killing the Turk that he imme-
diately killed himself. There is a theme for a really
Australian drama, even the title ready-made—“ Dri-
ving a Youth to Destruction.”
Or, if not for a drama, consider the possibilities of
the thing as a movie! Why, there must be at least
a fiver in it.
Act I. : Shirker, aged 67, preparing to go to work.
Shirks all day in a mine with a pick. Home-coming.
Reception by truculent landlady who places before
him a roast turkey and a tray of mince pies, telling
him that if he is not satisfied with that he had
better go to the Front. Distended shirker goes to
mantelpiece, and is in the act of lighting a cigar
when he sees a letter addressed to him. Opens it,
reads —and, striking his forehead with a gesture of
despair, hurriedly swallows a sob and rushes from the
house.
Act II.: Holman composing letters to young men.
Enter attendant with telegram. This announces that
Scaddan refuses to lend any more money. Holman,
seized by anguish, writes seven more letters to young
men asking them to lend .the Government 2s. 6d.
Enter Secretary with message from shirker asking
whether in lieu of going to the Front he could not
get' his expenses paid as an advocate of prompt
enlistment by the inhabitants of Liberal constitu-
encies? Holman looks hurriedly in the cash-box,
whispers to himself: “My God, has it come to this
that I must refuse to help the Empire!” and sinks
into his chair with a loud, mocking laugh of victory.
Act III.: Grey-haired shirker smoking cigar de-
scends from a motor-car at the Treasury buildings,
and forcing Holman’s. door with his pick encounters
the Premier. Lays before him the letter to a young
man. Holman mistakes him for the serang of the
Norton Griffiths combine coming with an agreement
to put up barbed-wire entanglements along the banks
of the Murray to prevent the escape of foodstuffs.
Finding his mistake lie (ells the man that discretion
is the better part of valor, and that he will submit
the matter to caucus. Shirker refuses to be repulsed,
and declares that if he enlists he will be breaking
faith with his union, which had arranged to go on
strike. Holman says that alters the situation en-
tirely. The visitor, folding himself in his dust-coat,
murmurs, “Et tu Brutus,” and falls on his pick.
Final scene: Holman explaining to the reporters
that the incident was quite uncalled for, and nothing
further need be said about it.
Why, the thing would run for months and months.
Tuft”: He had been drinking in the bar;
and that is what the law says a bar is for.
He had, perhaps, drunk too much ; but his
mate was helping him along. His mate was
in khaki; so wws he. He was rather argu-
mentative. The John Hop whose job it was
to arrest drunks was waiting at the most
likely place to capture them —outside the
place where the material for getting drunk
on was sold. There was a brief argument
about moving on, and then there was a
prismatic blending of dark blue with khaki,
out of which emerged a big blue Hop hold-
ing a khaki bantam. And the procession
moved off. The crowd lingered, feeling that
something had gone wrong. Apparently it
never occurred to the J. Hop to arrest'the
hotel. It hasn’t occurred to the Caucus,
either.
One of the first acts of Tory politicians
if ever they attain power again should be
to abolish figures. Joe Cook’s party called
the maternity bonus an insult to mother-
hood, and said that it would be resented by
right-thinking women; yet in 1914 . there
were 137,983 births in the Commonwealth,
and 139,159 bonuses paid. The difference
represents the rush of women who wanted
to be insulted even before they committed
a live offence.
William Hutchinson, M.L.A. for Borung
(Vic.), who has lately considered it neces-
sary to spend some time explaining his
administration of the Department of Agri-
culture, is a bulky Rechabite who com-
. menced his farm-expert’s career as a watch-
maker at Warracknabeal, in the Wimmera
district. He kept the old shop going for
some time after Borung sent him to Parlia-
ment, but in the end sold out and became a
politician entirely. Hutchinson, senior, was
a highly-respected bookseller at Warrackna-
beal, and brother Jack, who owns a profit-
able general-store in the same town, is a
lieutenant-colonel at the Front. 11. V.
McKay (the harvester man) and Minister
Hutchinson are cousins, through their
descent from the squatting Shaw family, of
Victoria and N. S. Wales.
Arthur Bourchier, of the London Garrick,
announces that his next play will be one
by William Archer, the ex-Queenslander who
is better known as dramatic critic than as
playwright. In his book on “Play-Making”
Archer modestly asks: “How comes it that
so many people, and I among the number,
who could not write a play to save their
lives, are eager to tell others how to do it?”
Rut that is a little hit of spoofifig self-depre-
ciation. Archer was only 25 and fresh from
rounding up cattle on his father's station
near Mount Morgan when he went to Lon-
don with the manuscript of “The Rush-
rangers” in his trunks. It was produced
on Easter Monday, 1881, at a long-popular
East End theatre, the Grecian, which was
soon afterwards acquired by General Rooth
and converted into a Salv’army citadel. A
melodramatically sensational piece, largely
built on the doings of Ned Kelly, it suited
the tastes of the East Enders and enjoyed
a fairly good run. One of its incidents was
the abduction of a squatter’s wife by an old
lover turned bushranger. Archer did not
turn out any more Australian plays, but he
translated the works of Ibsen and other
foreign dramatists into English. He got
himself called to the English Rar, but never
handled briefs, lie started dramatic criti-
cism on the Figaro, hut soon transferred to
the World, in whose columns he reviewed
the London playhouses for many years,
becoming second only to Clement Scott in
power and influence. Under the title of
“The Dramatic Year,” there are several
annual volumes of his critiques and impres-
sions. _ Latterly he has been bitten by the
phonetic craze, and as secretary of the
London Simplified Spelin Sosieti has been
trying to get people to write as they talk
and drop all unnecessary letters in the
words they use.
Listen to the thud of the Rrummagem joss
as its nose strikes the floor:
They must put their fiscal theories aside and look
at the condition of foreign exchange. They must dis-
courage imports, and have strict regard for the
necessity of reducing consumption thereof.
It is the Kritish Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer who is talking—talking not lightly
(if he ever does talk that way), but in a
deeply-considered Rudget speech. There
seems no help for it. We shall hate to lose
him; but we shall have to send Rruce
Horatius Smith to keep the Freetrade
bridge. And he will have to hurry or he
won’t be able to find even the necessary two
to stand beside him.
“Jean Sibi” : Finlayson, the dour,
courageous “anti” of the House of Reps.,
cherishes a great admiration for Harry
Lauder. In fact, the politician’s nearest
approach to a misspent life is the singing
o_f Lauder’s more rollicking ditties to select
circles of friends. He has a warm, round
bai’itone of unusual quality, and when he
lifted it up lately in a “Wee Deocli an’
Doris” at a Parliamentary dinner, the song
sounded none the less jolly because Finlay-
son would inevitably interpret its message
in terms of cocoa or tea. The songster,
by the way, has a deadly rival in artist
David Low, who will break out in “She’s
Ma. Daisy” or “Tobermory” on great provo-
cation. Low, it is darkly rumored, takes
his warbling verra seriously, and diets freely
on parritch and haggis to get the “local
color” into his voice.
A lady with a past blow into Port Jack-
son one day lately. This was the old French
barque Jean Bart. In 1912 she was wrecked
near Adelaide, and was sold with her wheat
cargo for a song. She was furbished up and
sold again to a German firm for 20 times the
wreck price. The insult of the squarehead
flag was wiped out in 1914 by a British
cruiser, which captured her off the South
African coast. Condemned by the Prize
Court, she was purchased by a British buyer
and re-cliristened Tridonia.
“Gus Gosh” proposes that it be made a
contract job :
The dreadful frequency with which Premiers do
not earn their salaries is becoming monotonous.
Why not introduce the payment-by-results principle
into public life? Take, for instance, the ease of
Holman, who engaged to carry into effect a certain
platform drawn up by the people who put him in
the way of a pay envelope. One of his jobs was to
see that the superfluous and extravagant Upper
House and State Governor were wiped out. Under
the proposal a percentage of his screw would he
docked for the omission to attend to these car-
buncles. It would of course be necessary for Pre-
miers, like other contractors, in submitting their
tenders to specify the time in which the job would
be done. Thus after the first month or so of office
(during which full screw would be paid) it would
be quite easy to determine what the Ministers should
forfeit as penalties for non-fulfilment. ■
“S.E.”: Pulled down at Christchurch
(M.L.) recently, the old Gaiety Theatre,
the first place of entertainment in the flat
place. It was erected in 1862, and for many
years has served as quarters for the waiters
and people connected with a neighboring
pub. But it saw some great times in its
youth. In March, 1871, it housed William
Hoskins and Florence Colville, who pro-
duced “The School for Scandal,” a comedi-
etta “A Morning Call,” and an extravaganza
“Nothing to Wear,” the last written by
Charles Matthews and presented to Hoskins.
Bland Holt’s first appearance in Christ-
church was at the Gaiety, on Sept. 1, ’79,
when he appeared with the G. D. Chaplin-
Rose Osborne company, and was seen as the
first Gravedigger in “Hamlet.”
The population of N. S. Wales at the
1911 census was 1,646,734. Of these 725,000
were packed into Sydney. The area of the
State is 198,054,420 acres; the number of
persons engaged in agricultural, pastoral
and other primary-producing occupations
was 204,014. These figures make it easy
to understand how great is the difficulty of
finding land for returned soldiers to settle
on. The place is getting absolutely con-
gested. Apart from holdings of from one
to 500 acres, the alienated land, amounting
to 14,000,000 acres, has actually been
divided up into 17,000 holdings. There
won’t be room to breathe directly.

Talking Machine
BRINGS to your home the most refined, pleasing, yet
inexpensive entertainment, entirely at your will.
Merely by a selection of Records it will provide your
friends an entire evening’s entertainment, changing from
vocal to instrumental music, of all kinds, rendering each item
with an astonishing degree of lifelike purity of tone and
distinctness. Or you may enjoy by yourself when tired by
the demands of your business, the most pleasant refreshment
of good music—a beautiful ballad ; operatic music by Melba,
Caruso, and all the greatest singers ; orchestral music by the
leading orchestras of the world; or a comic by the inimitable
Harry Lauder.
THE BEALE KALOPHONE is not an ordinary talking
machine. It is a scientifically constructed musical instrument,
manufactured to designs dictated by a lifelong experience of
the talking machine trade and a full appreciation of the
fundamental limitations of the ordinary “ commercial ”
talking machine. It has not been designed primarily with
an idea of the great volume of tone, but, whilst having ample
power for the largest hall, sufficient to cause the listener
frequently to remark, “ One would believe the singer in this
room,” it possesses an entirely unequalled purity of tone,,
free from scratch and brazen foreign sounds. By reason of
its extremely sensitive- reproducing mechanism, magnificent
motor and scientifically constructed wooden horn, it is the
first machine which will reproduce any possible musical effect
—a vocal item with the true beauty of the human voice ; a
violin solo with the proper “ woody ” tones of the violin ;
or band music with the bold military challenge of the brass band.

Old-looking Young Women.
Too many women and girls look old before
tlieir time. Faces are pale and drawn;
wrinkles appear, and the eyes lack lustre.
There are headaches, backaches and a gen-
erally wretched feeling. In most of these
cases the condition of the blood is to blame.
From one cause or another it has become
thin and watery, and it is a fact that anae-
mia, more than any other cause, gives women
that prematurely aged appearance.
It is- important that the blood supply be
replenished—important not only on the scoie
of good looks, but to restore robust health,
which is of greater moment. Dr. Williams |
Pink Pills for Pale People actually make
new blood and restore the system shattered
by overwork and worry. They impart, the
glow of health to pale faces and make tired,
weary women feel bright and happy. There
is no need for any woman or girl to feel ill
or look ill. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
help them to get the best out of life, Lour
own dealer can supply you with Dr. \\ u-
liams’ Pink Pills.

New Cure for Biliousness.
Torpid liver is usually the cause of the
drowsy, uncomfortable feeling and the lack
of ambition and energy often felt by many
people. If neglected, the condition usually
ends in a bad bilious attack.
I'inkettes, the new laxative, give excellent
results in cases of torpid liver and bilious-
ness. They have a specific action on the
liver and speedily banish the feeling of lassi-
tude and weariness. They are effective with-
out being drastic, and they have none
of the bad effects of strong purgatives. Pmk-
ettes also regulate the stomach and liver,
correct bad breath, clear the complexion, and
are an excellent remedy to use during colds
and fevers. Send your name and address for
a free trial sample, mentioning The Bul-
letin. Sold everywhere at Is. per bottle, or

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible b.\
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.

POLITICAL
POINTS
V\ estralia, whose mortality experience
among miners has become so shocking, is to
ha\ e workmen inspectors of mines at last—
"check inspectors.” as they are called in
VS. Wales and elsewhere. It would have
had them two years ago, when the last
amending Bill was before Parliament, had
not Labor Minister Collier rubbed the Cham-
ber of Mines .up the wrong way. and asked
for abolition of contract, reduction in heights
of stopes and a lot of other very debatable
things. Now. as a result of friendly con-
ferences between Collier and the mineowners’
1 epresentatives, the Rill is to be amended
principally in the direction of taking away
from the proposed inspectors the right to
initiate prosecutions, though, in order to
bluff extremists on both sides, a sham fight
is being put up in Parliament over other
features of the measure.

General) the obliging firm kept at bav a
would-be buyer*fof the Western Australia,
while arrangements were being made by the
State to finance its purchase. Scaddan reci-
procated the kindness by stepping in and
taking the Kangaroo oil' its hands. There
is, however, no money to pay for the boat,
so, out of consideration for the country’s
poverty the agreeable co. has accepted bonds
tor ±140.000. payment being spread over -, o
years.
tt lias just hail a lesson from the
l .S.A. The l/.N.A. reckonod they could do
w ‘lh some Maori land native flax. Isut they
didn i send along an order for shipments
lor ihe next seven years. That isn’t how
they have got their population of a hundred
millions. They merely sent for a shipment
ot (lax roots, and propose to let Oregon do
the rest.
To enable Tasmanian millers to meet the
competition of Japanese bran and such-like
stuff imported into Australia, and at the
same tune to sell flour at £lO 10s. per ton,
the i asmanian Government is selling to
them at Os. lid. per bushel wheat imported
from America at a cost of over Bs. Simul-
taneously someone who is not the Govern-
ment is sending this six-and-elevenpenny
wheat to the mainland, where it fetches
about Is. per bushel more, while the flour
made from the specially cheapened wheat is
also going across the water. The other day
the \\ immera took 1160 bags of wheat and
•*00.") bags of flour from Hobart to Mel-
bourne. What’s the taxpayer for but to
pay taxes, anyway? And what are State
1 rights for if not to assist in the plundering
oi: the public?
IN TOPIIET.
New South Wales is at present making careful
inquiries, both in London and America, as to the
possibility of securing loan money. —News item.
PREMIER HOLMAN: “ Excuse me, old chap,
any chance of securing a loan?”
The futility of Jokoolt as Leader of the
Opposition is becoming apparent even to
former supporters of the waspish little man,
and an attempt will be made to drop him as
gently as possible before the Referenda cam-
paign. In obtaining the leadership Cook
beat Forrest by a narrow margin, and the
supporters of Bigjohn reckon that his forth-
coming “jubilee” should be celebrated by
giving him the captaincy. Pushful Willy
Watt is also mentioned as a possible leader,
and also Irvine. But Irvine is not favored.
The Icecream, one of the l-est Nationalists
of the whole Parliamentary bunch, has more
than once exposed the fraudulency of the
politics of his own party, and is therefore
not “safe.”
The negotiations between the political
parties in Tas. for keeping in out of the wet
(otherwise termed “co-operating during the
period of the war”) have ended in the Labor
Government introducing a Bill to extend
the life of the present Assembly till March
31: 191”, thus putting off the evil day for
over .12 months. The Liberal Opposition
has appointed a committee of three who are
to sit with the Ministry in Cabinet and dis-
cuss and deliberate on- “all questions of
finance, legislation and administration.”
Cither party can terminate the agreement
on July do. 11)1(5, if it gives the leader of
the other party at least three weeks’ notice
in writing. The idea seems to be that if
the parties can get along till next July
without biting each other they can keep the
peace till March, 1017. There is a pious
addendum to the effect that the agreement
is not to affect the right of any member to
exercise his full freedom of speech and
action. So far the co-operative idea is going
beautifully, but when the little Bill for ex-
tending the life of Parliament comes before
the House of Dodery it is more than likely
i- will either die or emerge seriously
mangled.
“Everything the Education Department:
does is just,” Griffith, its Minister in X. S.
A\ ales, told the Assembly the other evening.
Just, perhaps, but very quaint. For in-
stance, it puts the failures to examine the
successes. There is more than one inspector
of recent appointment who couldn’t get a
first-class school, yet has not only to examine
first-class schools but also to recommend the
headmasters for promotion or otherwise. On
the whole, it isn’t much wonder that some
teachers in Griffith's Department reckon
that it pays better there, to be a failure than
a success.
A valuable Bill, originating in the X.S.W.
Leg. Council—J. D. Fitzgerald is its sponsor
—will, if it completes its journey, put a stop
to the ancient liberty of testators to leave
their widows and families to charity or the
washtub. It not only provides for the ad-
equate maintenance of testator’s dependents,
hut also adjusts the law regarding the guar-
dianship of infants. The limitation of the
power of vindictive people to wreak a post-
mortem vengeance lias long been wanted,
and N. S. Wales is one of the last places in
the world where legislation on the subject
has been withheld.
Joseph Cook raced the minors in his
maiden constituency ;it Lithgow (N.S.W.)
on a recruiting jaunt the oilier evening. The
net result was one recruit! Well, three
cheers for the one, anyhow.
N. S. Wales Coverninent, which fixed the
price of milling wheat at ss. per bushel, and
is ready to prosecute any farmer who dares
to sell it for more, has just sent out its bills
to those drought-stricken farmers whom it
supplied with seed wheat —inferior stuff
which no self-respecting cocky sowed with-
out first winnowing. The price is Os. Of
course the answer of the Government is
that it couldn’t afford to sell for the ss. fixed
by law for milling wheat. Neither could
the farmer; but a little thing like that didn’l
matter when it was a case of getting cheap
food for the bloated city at the impoverished
country’s expense.
Section 152 of the Customs Act provides
that any increase in duties on goods supplied
on contract may be recovered by the con-
tractor. This fair thing has been unques-
tioned for 14 years. The other day, however,
a Victorian firm had to sue a co-operative
co. for the amount of duty paid on gunny-
bags under an increased tariff. The claim
was resisted, and the County Court gave the
defendants a verdict, which was subsequently
sustained by the Victorian Full Court. The
snag is Section 55 of the Constitution Act,
which provides that “laws imposing taxation
shall deal only with the imposition of taxa-
tion, and any provision dealing with any
other matter shall be of no effect.” anil
that laws imposing duties of Customs shall
deal with duties of Customs only. Under
that provision Section 152 was held to be
invalid; and now any commercial person
who has contracted to supply imported goods
without providing for any increase in tariff
rates will hare to pay the duties himself—
unless the High Court upends the view of
the Victorian Full Court. If it doesn't,
Parliament will have to settle the matter
by a special Act. To make the contractor
liable will be to introduce more speculation
into a business that needs to be made as little
speculative as possible: and every time
a tender is put in. something will have to
be added to cover this contingency.
There has been dead silence from David
Ilall lately about the profits made by that
eminent Attorney-General through specu-
lating on behalf of the Mu State in wheat
and farm produce. At present David sees
chaff in his sleep—bags and tons and ship-
loads ol: it. lie heard (even an Attorney-
General may hear things) that X. S. Wales
was short of fodder; so he sent off to the
U.S.A. for 20.0(10 tons or so. to arrive just
when the new season’s hay would be coming
in. David’s chaff has lately been passing
through a mill at Homebush. There it is
being shaken and sieved to get rid of some of
the tons of dust and rubbish with which it
is loaded; and the job is so dreadful that
the men have to wear respirators. By the
time the dust that Hall paid for as chaff is
taken out and the grain that should have
been in the chaff but wasn’t has been nut
in, the stuff will cost £32 per ton : and you
can buy thousands of tons of far better
stuff in the country now for £3. Some of
the imported stuff has actually been
sold for £3 17s. Gd. It is a great
thing to have your produce business
managed for you by a lawyer. It is almost
as satisfactory as it would be to give a
tinsmith the job of Chief Justice!
Months ago a Hobart engineer, anxious to
do his bit. decided to look into tin l munition-
making business. He went to the officer in
charge of the ordnance stores and
asked for patterns and details. The
ordnance man sent him on to the
artillery officers at headquarters,
and they passed him
through to the
Commandant. The
Commandant wa s
very ready to help :
lie gave the seeker
a letter of intro-
duction to the ord-
nance officer he had
begun with. Armed
with this letter the
engineer went back
to the ordnance
officer, but as all
he could get were
directions for going
round the circle again, he dropped off, and
(ne Defence Department scored another win.
Ihe Victorian Education Department has
discovered that “Agricultural High Schools”
arc expensive futilities, and at Eehuca the
other day Minister Livingston wept tears
o'er the. wasted cash and vanished dream.
At one of these places, which costs £l4OO
a year and occupies 20 acres of land, there
appear to he two pupils, who arrive en masse
each morning. Inquiry into what has be-
come of those who have passed through the
schools discloses that, instead of growing
iiops, they are decorating office stools and
driving delivery carts. Livingston, looking
legietfulJy nt the hole in the cashbox, man-
,l. ' decided “not to open any more.” If
Livingston tracked the pupils of the ordi-
nary agricultural colleges lie would also find
astonishingly few who have stuck to farm-
mg. I lie t rouble is that Australian papers
and politicians have got into the habit of
talking in an airy way about “going on the
land, and youngsters have gone into schools
and colleges to learn about silos and Berk-
shire ducks, and then the old man has
startl'd to nose round for particulars of the
cost of getting on the land, and has mostly
discovered that to merely equip a decent-
sized farm and hang on to it till it produces
something costs as much as it does to equip
a youngster for a profession
Hue Australian fiarracker against national
service lor defence objects to.the thing for
being illogical, and triumphantly establishes
Ins case thus:—
.jJ * s t°gieal to force men to fight against their
'V *’ it would be equally logical to force men to
stay at home against their will.
To which The Bulletin replies that if Aus-
tralia could be defended from the horrors of
war by ordering every Australian not to
show las face outside the back door until the
fight was won through the enemy becoming
exhausted looking for something to hit, then
this paper would throw logic overboard with
one. loud splash, and barrack for compulsory
hiding ill the kitchen.
THE STEPPING STONE.
There are 10,000 good arguments in favor
of the lieferenda proposals, so there was no
need to again wheel out this busted Free-
trade superstition:—■
Think wliat high prices mean to the wives of those
at the front, who freely risk their lives that we may
be free, and to the widows and mothers of the men
who have fallen.
Having thought on this, suppose the Aus-
tralian citizeii has a think about what low
prices would mean to the same parties. Also,
as the argument declares that “high prices
impair national efficiency,” let him also think
very hard on that point. Having done so
lie will see that if low prices are such good
things they can be at once secured by (1)
cutting down wages, and (2) drawing a pen
through the tariff. There is really no diffi-
culty about producing low prices if this Gov-
ernment thinks they are a good thing in-
stead of the curse they really are.
The Peacock Government, being fully
seized of the serious financial position, has
already begun to retrench. It has reduced
the country train services, with much justi-
fication in some cases; also it has reduced
the working staffs at small stations or abol-
ished them altogether, to the great loss and
discomfort of country people who were well-
loaded with losses and discomforts already.
SAUCE FOR THE GANDER.
THE DON: “Say, John, isn't this the same
crowd that I've heard demand the more
equal distribution of wealth!"
Tliese economies may save the State a few
hundreds a year, though even that is doubt-
ful ; while the Assembly has fooled away
about £2500 in futile party-censure motions
during the last month, the House of Fat has
simultaneously wasted £lOOO or so in doing
nothing, and the unnecessary State Gover-
nor continues to spend the £lO,OOO a year
lie costs the State in his usual enthusiastic
manner.
THE GREAT FISHER MYSTERY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
i> . that is the whole point,” said the
1 nine Minister, smiling mysteriously. —Daily paper.
The smile of Andrew Fisher is a lovely thing to see,
When mysteriously it flutters from his eyes to his
moustache,
And a very sphinx for caution and obscurity is he;
Oh, his bitterest opponents never speak of him as
rash.
There are men of keener intellect and wider vision
too,
Of more brilliant parts and subtle, you can meet with
any day,
But for keeping dark a secret there are reallv veri-
few
Wiio can tantalise the public in his Scotch and
cheerful way.
Xow will Fisher go to London or remain in office
here ?
lis the riddle of the moment men are asking far
and wide.
And the daily papers argue till they make it almost
clear
That his bag is packed and ready to he wafted o'er
the tide.
Oh, the mystery appals us, and the ripple of his
smile
Is a blend of serpent folly with the cunning of the
lamb,
But for all his fine evasion, and despite his gentle
guile,
He can go or stay and welcome and we do not care

DOES YOUR CHILD SUFFER FROM
WORMS?
Stomach and intestinal worms are the
cause of nine-tenths of the crying, fretful-
ness and irritability of children. The mere
mention of worms makes one feel uncomfort-
able, and their presence in the system must
assuredly cause such torture and agony that
there is'little wonder at the irritable dispo-
sition which is so often developed, not only
in children, but frequently in adults. Worms
require a specific medicine, and there is no
better remedy than Comstock’s “Dead Shot’
Worm Pellets. .
They are a purely vegetable medicinal
preparation for the eradication of worms in
children and adults. For sale by all chem-
ists and storekeepers, price 3s. Gd. per

SPORTING
NOTIONS
A joyous item brightened New Plymouth
(M.L.) the other clay. In one of the draper’s shop
windows was displayed a leathern waistcoat bearing
a ticket with the information that 5000 of the gar-
ments were wanted for the men at Gallipoli. The small
town was much interested in the thing the first day ;
but on the second day of display the window was
nearly burst in by the excited populace. The ticket
had by that time fallen from the waistcoat on to a
selection of lace-trimmed —er —well, never mind.
“Five thousand of these wanted for our boys at the
Front!” It was a great day.
* * * *
The honors of the just-concluded A..J.C.
meeting were with St. Carwyne, Reputation, Cetigne
and Carlita. The two firsts (Metropolitan and Craven
Plate), a dead-heat in the Spring Stakes and third in
the Randwick Plate put St. CaTwvne into the first
flight of Australian prads. Reputation, who dead-
heated with him in the Stakes, and was second and
third in the Plate and the Metropolitan, turned out
to be a little dandy who appropriated most of the
ill-luck that happened to be lying round at Rand-
wick during the week, and was additionally unfor-
tunate in meeting a horse that had, with good
reason, been regarded as unreliable even if brilliant
just when the animal happened to be at the very top
of his form. There can be little doubt that the
public saw St. Carwyne do the best he is callable 01 ;
but Reputation will probably do better things yet.
( etio-ne’s place among the three-year-olds is not alto-
gether clear, but he won both the Derby and Clibborn
Stakes in such good style as to give him a strong
claim to consideration as the best of his year.
The best performance of the meeting was put up
by Carlita, whose win in the Randwick Plate, with
Sst. 91b., stamps her as an exceptionally good mare.
She won' from end to end, and without being
pressed ran the two miles in 3min. 27 (min. from a
field which included Uncle Sam, Ulva’s Isle and St.
Carwyne. Carlita is weighted at Bst. 51b. for the
Melbourne Cup, and on this running must be counted
as one of the most dangerous among the top-weights.
At the finish she was leaving the others at every
stride. Of the beaten division Uncle Sam was doing
best over the last furlong. St. Carwyne’s perform-
ance in this event was such as to establish his
strong dislike for a two-mile journey. Put under
pressure against Cagou for second money he turned
it, up at the critical moment, running away from the
whip with a celerity that would have carried him
right across the course had Cagou not been there to
block the way. The difference between St. Carwyne
and Woorak merely seems to be that the latter gets
sooner tired of being bustled. The five-year-old will
certainly see a mile and a half out to the bitter end
(vide the Metropolitan), but a mile is quite enough
for Woorak, and then onlv if nothing collars him.
In the Craven Plate (1-i mile) he started favorite at
7 to 4 on, and spread joy through the Land of Judah
by promptly shutting up when asked to shift himself
more rapidly over the last furlong. What on earth
impels people to back a horse like this is one of the
turfs .manv mysteries. The writer of this paragraph
wouldn’t trust him with tuppence in a sprint over
50 yards.
Of course, the demented tribe who go a-punting
got all the worst of it on the meeting. The first
day was not particularly profitable to the Bar Yons,
but they managed to get a crust on the second, some
butter on the third, and on the fourth a case of fizz
and a box of cigars. Saturday’s events ended accord-
ing to the prophets of woe and desolation, the
favorite going down with a heavy thud five times
out of six, and in the solitary race where the animal
won he was a mighty poor favorite. Two races were
won by the rankest of outsiders —Scoutmaster the
Waverlev Handicap, and Schoches the Dowling
Steeplechase. The first of these had been in the
habit recently of winning under welter weights at
northern provincial meetings, and probably wondered
what had happened when he found himself with a
midget of 6st. 71b. in the saddle for the Metropoli-
tan. Anyhow, he was so much surprised that he ran
nearlv last. But bv Saturday he had got over his
astonishment, and then fled over a mile and three-
quarters of ground in such a hurry that he snatched
what looked like a certainty from Sea Pink in the
last few strides and set up a fresh Australian record
for the distance. Schoches, who got away with the
Steeple, is an unprepossessing-looking customer with
a record of wins in the show ring as a buggy horse
and jumper. He is said to have changed hands not
long ago at the enormous price of £l7. If any people
expected him to win they didn’t go near the books,
for his name was scarcely written. Yet he jumped
and stayed so well as to suggest that somebody has
missed a rare opportunity of throwing in for a
hatful over something bigger than Saturday’s event.
The day after Mountain Knight’s poor
showing in the Spring Stakes lie was reported to be
very sick, which in a way of speaking evened things
up a bit to the punters who were feeling ill about
laying odds on him winning. There was talk of the
Knight having been doped by an enemy. Maybe.
Anyhow, he was scratched for Caulfield, and that
made a lot more people feel ill. Since then the
horse is reported to be doing as well as can be
expected, and has consequently been backed by
someone or other for the Melbourne Cup. As he has
9st. to carry on that trip it looks just as likely as
not that there will be more sickness about next
month. Better horses than Mountain Knight haven’t
been in front with that weight before to-day.
Cheerful news for purchasers of high-
priced yearlings: Cetigne cost his owner 200 guineas,
St. Carwyne 100 and Carlita 125. The winnings of
the three at Randwick were £13,793. Wolaroi,
winner of the Breeders’ Plate, was bred by his owner;
Eulacre, winner of the Gimcrack Stakes, was sold
as a yearling for 75 guineas. They won £3868_.
Sister Satellite, second in each event, cost 1125
guineas. i
The win of a Sydney medical man over
the A.J.C. meeting ran into five figures, most of it
landed when St. Carwyne got the second leg of the
double in with the Metropolitan. The winner re-
joiced exceedingly and was glad in public places.
Looking on at the Metropolitan there was another
man who won the best end of a competency a few
years ago. lie walked away in misery and gloom;
for when St. Carwyne snatched the stake which
William the Silent should have won, the five figures
he would have called round to collect were blown
bubbles. The luck of the game!

“Devilfish”: Fishermen spin awful yarns
about the number of fish they catch, but can any
of them beat this?
Janies Lumsden de-
posed in evidence
before a Royal
Commission that
fishing with rod
and line, he once
jerked 100 dozen
freshwater herring
or cucumber mullet
out of the Derwent
near New Norfolk
(Tas.) in eight
hours. That means
five fish every two
minutes. Another
angler, W. Crooke,
avers that with a
bush sapling, a bit
of string and a
white fly his father
once hauled nearly
]OO dozen of the
same fish, averag-
ing about £lb.
apiece, out of the
Huon River in a
few hours. It would
take a smart man
to catch one cu-
cumber mullet in
either Huon or
Derwent now.

punters who follow form and measure chances by tne
odds they can get have a win thrust upon them by
the betting market. St. Carwyne, for the Craven
Plate last week, was a case in point. The handsome
son of St. Alwyne started at 7’s, 8 s and 10 s to 1
(the last the standard price) in a field of five yn
form he was far and away the most reasonable in-
vestment at the price, and his backers won their
monev. Ten to 1 St. Carwyne in a w.f.a. race five
starters! On the previous Saturday he had caught
Reputation at the end of a 12-furlongs w.f.a. race,
giving 51b. to the Maoriland horse. Mountain Knight,
Cagou, Ulva’s Isle, Carlita and others were behind
the dead-heaters. On the Monday the Metropolitan
proved the truth of Saturday’s running, and sug-
gested that St. Carwyne was improving, for this
time, when he met Reputation and the others on
101 b. better terms than before, he beat them very
handsomely. Oil the Wednesday he had to give
41b. to Reputation, whilst he was meeting Cagou on
practically the same terms as in the Saturday race.
But this' time the distance was only 10 furlongs,
and for no conceivable reason, save weight of money,
Reputation and Cagou started at shorter odds than
St. Carwyne, whilst Woorak, the brilliant miler, was
backed down to 6 to 4. This was where the fol-
lowers of form came in. They remembered that St.
Carwyne, the 12-furlongs champion of to-day, had
seemed to have more speed than stamina last year.
When he finished third for the Metropolitan in 1914
he was swerving as though tired. Again in the
Caulfield Cup, with a light weight up, he tired
after being in the lead. But in the Melbourne
Stakes (10 furlongs) St. Carwyne had beaten Ale-
conner, Cagou, Posinatus and others on w.f.a. terms.
If the St. Carwyne of 1914 could win the Melbourne
Stakes with a brilliant rush, what reasonable punter
could forget to back the St. Carwyne of last week
for a w.f.a. race over the Melbourne Cup distance,
seeing that the price was 10 to 1 in a field of five?
Only once in a blue moon does Ikev Mo offer so
tempting an investment on the course.
* * * *
One of the best “good things” that ever
didn’t come off for the Metropolitan was the im-
ported Positano in 1897. Positano, like St. Car-
wvne last year, won the Spring Stakes on A.J.C.
Derby Day quite unexpectedly, and like St. Carwyne
last "year lie was thrown into the Metrop. at a light
weigiit. A son of St. Simon, and of goodly appear-
ance, a five-year-old with a nrevious win to his credit,
the English nag looked the best of “certs.” for the
Metrop. All the old occasional punters, who finger
a £5-note a long time before putting it on a
racing “moral,” rolled up with their subscription
for Positano in the Metrop. They wired their fivers
to the leading books of the time. They walked or
cabbed to the offices on the Monday morning. They
went to Randwick to see the certainty come off. But
it didn’t come off. Positano finished nowhere. He
was an uncertain-tempered animal, already in the
stallion stage of life, and after one or two more
failures he was put to the stud. A fine lot of
children have resulted. Poseidon, Lord Nolan,
Piastre and Posinatus were four that won the Mel-
bourne Cup. # #
As a matter of course, William the Silent
and Reputation are worth backing for the Caulfield
and Melbourne Cups, because they were placed in
the Metropolitan, which for the past nine years has
been the surest of handicap tests. Only once (in
1909) have the placed horses in the Metrop. failed
to provide a winner or a placed horse in one or
other of the Cups. Last year St. Carwyne s third
in the Metrop. was confirmed by a third in the Oaul-
field and a fourth in the Melbourne Cup. In four
previous instances the second for the Metrop. scored
a win at Caulfield or Flemington, or both. And in
three other cases the third in the Metrop. won the
Caulfield Cup. All within nine years ihese are
figures that talk. The actual winner ot the Metrop.
is usually stopped by his penalty it he goes for the
big handicaps in Victoria, but the two gees that
came next to him are always a dangerous pair. A
gambler might fairly take 6 to 4 in thousands that
William the Silent and Reputation will account tor
one or other of the Cups between them.
* * * *
The Caulfield Cup winner is commonly
said to want a lot of finding, but the fact remains
that the winner for the last five years has not
averaged more than 6 to 1. He or she has been
among the favorites at the start. This prophet
prefers Patrobas, William the Silent, Reputation
Burrabadeen, Lavendo (all of them short-priced) and
the questionable Cyklon to St. Carwyne Garlin,
Aurifer, Prince Bardolph, Golden Wire and the rest
of the field. They can’t all win or get placed;
Say William the Silent in a loud tone of voice. lie
has an undeniably great chance on paper, and at
time of writing there is nothing against him save
the allegation that he seemed a bit sore after the
trip from Sydney. William will have G. Meddielc
instead of little Dempsey on his back when he runs
at Caulfield, which may or may not be a help to the
little gee that lost the Metropolitan so unluckily.
No matter how they may perform in the Caul-
field event, the Melbourne Cup chances of Lavendo,
Patrobas, Burrabadeen and Reputation will look good
if the nags continue to thrive. Patrobas has vet to
be promoted to the same three-year-old “class ’ as
Cetigne and Wallace Isinglass, but he is likely to
get there after the V.R.C. Derby if all goes well
with him this next fortnight. Anyhow, he’s a good
sort of Wallace colt to be in the Melbourne Cup at
6st. 71b.
* * * *
Guineas Day at Caulfield brought forth no
evidence as to the strength of the coming N.S.W.
contingent, except that Flash of Steel ran nowhere m
the Toorak Handicap, whereas E. J. Watt’s pre-
cocious Maori Mat had slipped away with the
Debutant Stakes. Patrobas won the Guineas decis-
ively, after a rough passage, and Traquette got the
better of Cyklon in the Caulfield Stakes, which is
a nine-furlongs race. At a mile it looked as though
the imported horse (who was giving 91b.) would
certainly overtake the flying mare, but she kept
going whilst he failed for want of condition, appar-
ently. A mighty fine gentleman is Cyklon, but not
a Melbourne Cup horse, according to this scribe’s
ideas concerning the sort pf animal that is best oyer
a long distance. Nor did he seem likely to be ripe
for the Caulfield Cup struggle on Saturday. In the
meantime, however, Cyklon has probably run in the
Eclipse Stakes on Wednesday, and if he has won the
11 furlongs race, or gone very near it, he will have
a second-to-none chance for the big handicap on
Saturday. Presuming that William the Silent also
has had the colors up for the Eclipse Stakes,
punters can draw their own comparisons between the
two English horses —at the weights.
Two previous winners during the same afternoon
—King Marco and Traquette—were saddled again for
the Toorak Handicap, the last race on the card.
This was an unprecedented happening. One winner
is sometimes brought out for a second go at a big
meeting, but two is a record. The pony King
Marco, who had won the Welter race four hours
earlier, started at 12 to 1 aud finished a good third,
only 1-J lengths behind the winner. Traquette was
backed down to 7 to 4, but her tussle with Cyklon
only two hours ago had taken too much steam
out of the mare. Besides she was humping 9st. 31b.,
and the pace was exceptionally hot. The Toorak this
year was the fastest mile ever run on the Caulfield
course.
“Snowy” : It was tbe annual race-meeting
at Conargo (N.S.W.), and down on Billabong Flat
shearers and station-men had gathered for a day’s
sport. After five favorites had gone down matters
looked serious for the punters, and comment concern-
ing the judge, who was mounted In a dray, was of
an aspersive and sweeping character. As the field
turned into the home straight in the last race it was
seen that the favorite was running like a cow. Some-
thing had to be done, and like a flash an inspiration
seized the bunch. With a whoop they ran that
tip-dray headlong for the billabong; and when the
judge had climbed out and emptied his eyes of green
weed and mud the mokes were coming back to
unsaddle.
* * * *
A ticket-snatcher lias been given 32
months’ easy life for following his profession at
Moonee Valley (Vic.). It sounds a fair “stretch”;
but no doubt the Court considered the long list of
unpunished snatchings, and hardened its heart accord-
ingly. Precious few punters take a record of their
ticket- numbers, and the crime is therefore difficult to
sheet home once the snatcher has departed. It is
a petty business, but it beats bank-breaking for safe
profits.
* * * *
Somebody in the Cold Country has dis-
covered that an Act passed in the time of Henry
the Mormon requires the Archbishop of Canterbury
to keep a stud for the breeding of “swift horses.”
William Allison, of London Sportsman, reckons this
shows that in the time of the historical Fatman the
quality of the nag was a matter of national concern,
and suggests that his Gaiters should he haled before
the Beak and invited to explain wily he should not
pay a fine or hand over his job to Richard Marsh or
Dick Wootton. If a common informer succeeded
in an action against the shovel-hatted gent, he (the
informer) would receive half the fines, which would
amount to £l4O.
* * * *
As is customary, many small punters failed to meet
their obligations. Fielders regard such happenings
as inevitable. — Lachrymose par. in Sydney journal.
Fred Dyer, otherwise known as “the
singing Welshman,” and Les Darcy climbed into the
ring at Sydney Stadium on Saturday, and the subse-
quent proceedings were just plain farce. Dyer hadn’t
a thousand to one chance, and before the first round
had ended was a sore and sorry pug. Darcy had
hard work keeping up with the retreating enemy, but
when they happened to come together smote him
with direful emphasis. Once he was cautioned for
hitting low, but the occurrence was really the result
of Dyer leaping upwards and taking the glove on
a part of himself that wasn’t there before. A man
only needs to leap high enough at the right moment
to make any blow fall below the plimsoll. At the
end of the fifth lesson Wales was a bleeding wreck,
and early in the sixth the towel intercepted further
execution. When this pair met before Dyer saw
the journey through. This time Darcy made him
look like a novice.
* * * *
Although the contour of Harry Reeves
amidships suggested a pneumatic pup, he managed
to account for Joe Bonds at Melbourne Stadium on
Saturday night. He got the verdict at the end of
do rounds, mainly by being somewhere else when
Bonds started to hurl himself to the front. The big
Canadian was burdened with a useless right, damaged
on Jack Darcy the previous Saturday, and with a
rib dented by Beeves in round two. In consequence
his reliance was on a left hook, his right being sent
over only about half a dozen times, once in the
twelfth round welting Reeves down for four. Reeves's
ducking and dodging made the performance look like
a contortion act, with Bonds as the comic assistant.
When he smote, however, it was with both hands,
and the approval of Providence and the referee was
upon him. Bonds took home an over-size hand, a
shattered rib, a thick ear, and, by the look of the
house, about three half-crowns.
* * * *
“Rag”: Uid Charon received a splendid
oar for his ferry-boat when George Upward died
at Sydney last week. Few, if any, have figured so
actively in Australian rowing since he made his inter-
colonial debut as stroke of the triumphant Victorian
Eight in 1880. He sat in the same seat for several
years, with all but unbroken success, and
then devoted himself to the sport as coach.
In the matter of styles “G.E.,” whilst adhering in
fundamentals to the English style (as per Woodgate),
introduced modifications of his own, which eventu-
ally developed into the present Victorian system. I
hope the tide will be with him down the Styx.
For a crust he toiled as a clerk, first, ill the Vic-
torian Assembly, and then in the Commonwealth
Parliament; and his kindliness amounted to genius.
Sydney sportsmen’s battalion holds a fine-
record. On the word of hon. sec. Frank Iredale, only
one recruit was turned down for physical deficiency
in the first batch of SOO!
* * * *
The “possibilities” forecasted a month ago
about the lingering football Finals in Adelaide were
all there. To begin with, the third on the list,
West Adelaide, beat the first, Port. Then the fourth,
Sturt, beat the second, South Adelaide, by some
miraculous straight-kicking (nine goals six behinds)
in a sideways gale which sent South’s more numer-
ous shots a trifle wide of the posts. In the so-called
final, Sturt beat West again by straight shooting,
seven goals three behinds against two goals 13
behinds; and, on Port Adelaide exercising their
right of challenge, Sturt beat them also, by two clear
goals. The Sturt 18 are a young and keen lot, ami
the club had never before won the premiership, while
Port have been either first or second for seven years
past. Sturt only got into the “last four” by a
scramble, but put up a great performance in beating
the other three in turn within as many weeks.
* * * *
The question of what would happen in
Adelaide football if the “fairest and most brilliant
player” of the season happened to be two individuals
is still unsettled ; but the Magarey medal which
goes to that player has this year been awarded to
Barry, of the South Adelaides, as being both. The
referee in each first-class match registers his decision
as soon as it is over, and the votes are counted at
the end of the season. This time there was a dead-
heat of three, and the referees had to come together
to make the award. Barry is now training to kick
Turks.
* * * *
“D.F.” : The football season blew out at
Hobart the other Saturday with Lefroy on top.
Financially it was the worst season the League ever
struck, and when it has paid the Cricket Association
for the ground there will not he enough left to buy
bootlaces. The cricketers are moving warwards, too,
and the districts have to be cut down from five to
four. Even so there will be a job to rake teams
together. A lot of the best men are at the Front.
At the annual meeting a proposal was made to drop
the district matches altogether and play only scratch
games, but though it met with a good deal of sup-
port it did not go through. Financially the cricket
outlook is hazy, apart from the war; for the foot-
ballers find most of the boodle to keep the Associa-
tion’s ground going, and now the City Council is
making a new sports ground and is pretty sure to
get the League as a tenant.
Sydney University A grade cricket team
has lost its first match handsomely. The ’Varsity
has been one of the strongest elevens during the last
few seasons, yet on the opening day of 1915-6 the
club was represented by hardly any players wlv:
had ever shown in first grade. Practically the whole
of last year’s team enlisted, and many oi them have
seen active service. Another elub to do magnifi-
cently is Central Cumberland. Owing to enlist-
ments it has shut down temporarily.
Manly (N.S.W.) Municipal Council felt
a flutter in its chest last week when an application
was made for the payment of £5 15s. —money and
valuables “lifted” while the owner was in the surf.
The Council hires out a costume and a dressing
cubicle for 10d., and as somebody opened the cubicle
and took the valuables the owner opined that lie
had a claim on the Council. The Council naturally
decided that he hadn’t. Some day, however, a can-
tankerous person will argue the matter, and the
discussion won’t do Manly any good. The Sydney
Municipal (Domain) baths give a guarantee against
loss for the payment of one penny, and bathers at
Manly should get something for six times that
charge. The thief scourge is one of the drawbacks
in surfing, and the councils’ unconcern is almost
conspicuous enough to make an outsider believe that
the municipalities call tenders for the job of looting
their customers.
*. * * *
“Retlaw” : Fishing is a gay old sport
sometimes, but you’ll get something specially lively
if you go after the “stingarees” on the mud flats
on ‘the Clarence River (N.S.W.). But it’s no game
for a lone hand. The paraphernalia required is good
strong shark lines, offal for bait (the louder the
better), and a supply of saplings or fence rails about
10ft. long. If luck is in, the stingrays bite very
quicldv. All hands tail on to the line and haul.
Then the saplings are brought into use. The lively
time consists in trying to break the beast s back
without" being caught by the switching tail. To bit!
a wriggling stingray with a heavy long pole while
steering clear of his sting and keeping your feet
on a greasy bank takes some doing. I’ve seen the
beast hauled out 3ft. across and with a tail 6ft. tc
Bft. long.
But perhaps the best sport with stingrays in Aus-
tralia can be had in the American River, Kangaroo
Island (S.A.). They are there by the thousand.
The local plan is to harpoon them as you drift in a
dinghy.
AFTER THE MATCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now from the close-clipt field the players come,
Silent and white across the restful green ;
No bugle brings them respite, and no drum
Rolls as night comes to shroud the peaceful scene ;
No trench has scarred, no grave has heaped their
turf !
On other shores beats war’s tumultuous surf.
To some past age that we had half-forgot
Belongs this flannelled pageant, done with play,
That from the pitch comes in with pleasure hot,
While dies in sweetness one more summer’s day ;
The scent of fresh-crushed grass clings to the ball;
And yet—there’s something ghostly in it all!
O peaceful summer days, how faint and far
You seem to us who scarce can see for tears!
O 'happy nights, when ev’ry thoughtful star
Shone down ori lovers planning for the years!
Is this indeed the same round Earth you knew,
Ere on the world the envious Prussian drew?
How many comrades that we knew of old
Have played their last in Death’s terrific game?
Ilow many lovers, too, their last tale told,
Now dreams alone in fields whose crops are flame?
Ah, you who lounge beneath the bordering trees,
What joy find you in games, remembering these?
The crowd is gone. The night comes on and lays
Its shadow fingers on your battle-ground.
Who wears the tinsel crown, the paper bays,
For deeds that rang the painted pickets round?
Play if you must, but vision, in God’s name,
The hedge of steel that guards your tiny game!
N.S.W.
GALLIPOLI.
“Some punters failed to pay!” they cry;
As though all hostile views it squelches.
Still, there’s a chance we yet may try;
The Tote —that neither scales nor welshes !

This State office was brought to life 10 years
ago, chiefly to serve as a brake upon the
insurance cos. in the fire business, which
had pushed their rates up so high that they
were regarded as over the odds. Good evi-
dence that they were over the odds was soon
forthcoming: even before this office could get
to work the rates were lowered. Two years
ago the general manager reckoned that the
public had been thus saved altogether about
a million and a half in premiums. It often
happens that the competitor who is respon-
sible for cheaper goods is allowed to go to the
Avail; and after the funeral A r ery good
reasons are usually found for putting prices
back to Avhere they ivere before, or a bit
above it. In this case the office, though it
hasn’t had all the support it should have
got. has no cause to complain ; and, as the
table shoAvs, an increasing number of people
see the Avisdom of keeping it alive and
vigorous.
In one respect it is just as AA r ell that the
groAvth of annual premium income has been
gradual: it has alloived the office to maintain
reserves fairly commensurate Avith the risks,
which it couldn't have done if the premiums
had come in A'ery much more rapidly. In
that case, no doubt, it could have draAvn
upon the State for the £lOO,OOO of capital
Avhich the Treasury is authorised to pro-
vide. But the aim of the office has always
been to live on its oavii resources; and
1 except for £2OOO which it got to start Avitli
and subsequently repaid) it has easily been
able to do that. In the long run the policy-
holders Avill get the advantage of the saving
of interest. Sooner or later, when the
reserves have been further strengthened, and
provided that things go along as they have
gone hitherto, a reduction of rates is cer-
tain. During the past four years the
premiums have paid all claims and expenses,
and 2S p.c. of the income has been left
over; and though for the present it is neces-
sary for safety’s sake to go on accumulating
such profits against the risk of conflagration
and other hazards and contingencies, the
time will come Avhen it will be recognised
that it is not necessary to ask the public
for £lOO when £72 is enough—or say £75,
alloAving for necessary additions to the cur-
rent risks reserve. It isn’t a pleasant thing
for private cos. to contemplate; but even
private cos. Avon’t gain anything by burying
their heads in the sand and refusing to see
the inevitable.

Mining at Westonia (W.A.) has resulted
in the diseoA-ery of undreamt-of Avater. The
granite outcrops of the West have always
been known to hold supplies of more or less
consequence gathered from rainfall, but
nothing like the supplies struck underground
at Westonia Avere ever imagined. In one
instance a rock drilling party ivas practi-
cally SAvept aAvay as the steel bored into one
of these reservoirs, and lately in the Edna
May there has been a pressure of 701 b. to
the inch in the Aoav from the holes in the
face. Plant to cope with 100,000 gallons is
being provided to combat the stream. Un-
fortunately the water is mineralised, other-
Avise some of the holdings surrounding the
mine would haA-e a chance of saving them-
selves from inevitable collapse by blossoming
into irrigation concerns.
John De'ason, of Moliagul (Vic.). avlio
died the other day, always stuck to it that
he and his mate found the famous Welcome
Stranger nugget by simply striking a long
pick into the surface. A lot of the rich gold
thereabouts Avas, he said, got that ivay. If
the pick struck nothing the sampler tried
again further on; if the pick-point struck
something likely, he dug. Often, of course,
it Avas stone or wood, but occasionally it
was gold. Deason believed that the “Wel-
come Stranger” had been shed from a large
“bloAv” of quartz just beloAV Avhere it was
found. Tlis theory Avas that here and there
in this "buck” body Avas a patch of gold,
and that the big nugget had been one. He
believed that if a tunnel Avere put in. and
the bloAv shattered by an enormous charge
of explosives, other patches might be found :
but he never managed to get a syndicate to
test the idea. Deason’s battery at Moliagul
is one of the quaint old-timers in Victoria,
but it is still quite capable of crushing
quartz. Its trouble is to get quartz Avorth
crushing.
"O’Phrmerty": A mighty dismal place is
Kelly Basin, on Macquarie Harbor (Tas.).
Tt Avas to have been the port for the Lyell
field: but that Avas before the big amalga-
mation Avhich resulted in the present Mount
Lyell Co. Hotels, stores and houses Avere
built on a lavish scale. A railway ran some
miles up the Linda Valley to connect Avith
the mine. The rolling stock included five
locos, and hundreds of ore trucks, and a
station was made at the Kelly Basin end
big enough to serve a large town. Just as
the place seemed launched on a career of
prosperity, iicavs came through of the amal-
gamation and that Strahan Avould be the
port of the ueiv co. Kelly Basin died in
less than a Aveek. That Avas years ago, and
noAv the place is the pathetic sarcophagus
of hope. The only sign of life visible is
Avhen the Mount Lyell Co. runs a train over
the line noAV and then in order to hold its
rights.

THE DAY OF THE EXPERT. To-day is the day of the expert —the Ilian who knows every detail of his work
- -who is thorough, efficient and up to date. The engineer who desires to reach the top of the tree in his profession must
he conversant with everv engineering* method which makes for speed, complete craftsmanship, and for economy.
THE ENGINEER WHO DOES NOT KNOW of the Oxy-Acetylene process is not abreast of the times; he is
at big* disadvantage, and leaves himself open to the charge of incompetence.
Throughout the world to-day the Oxv-Acetylene process is the latest scientific addition to every engineering
workshop, "which, fitted with this process, has an advantage over the opposition impossible to estimate. It is simple,
vet wonderfully effective: its price is trifling, and the plant is portable. AV hither the broken parts require to be cut
or welded at the bench or b,v the roadside is of no consequence.
Any work of Iron or Steel welding or cutting- can be carried out with Ox.v-Acetylene. It is revolutionising
f the Engineering trade. Broken parts that once were useless can now be successfully welded and made new
again. This, too. in the matter of minutes. Cost is a matter of pence as compared with the expenditure
of pounds in the old method of buying new parts and rna king new drawings and c astings.
All Engineers should at once write us for free catalogues and illustrations showing- the remark-
able variety of work that can be done with Oxy-Acetylene. Following are a few of the broken
and worn machinery parts our process will make new again:
Cracked or broken Aluminium Crank or Gear Cases, Differential Boxes, Steering- Wheels, Pipes,
Cylinders, Piston's, Cranks, Clutches, Cardan Shafts, Band Brakes, Worn Key ways in Shafts.
Pieces welded to broken Gears and New Teeth Cut, etc.
Broken Machinery of any kind can. be welded, including- Cast Iron, Wrought Iron. Mild
Steel, Brass, Copper,* Gun Metal, etc., which cannot be repaired by any other process.
The latest authoritative work on the subject, “A Practical Manual of
Autogenous Welding,” published by Charles Griffin & Co., London, states:
“Within the last few years welding by oxy-hvdrogen and oxy-acetylcne blow-
pipes has been applied in thousands of workshops.” Those workshops which arc
rapidly adding the process to their equipment include manufacturers, con-
tractors, machine shops, garages, blacksmiths, boilermakers, repair shops,
foundries, steel mills and railroad shops.

to your best customer. .. .K.F.M.: What a whirl of
words! For a start knock out four-fifths of your
adjectives. .. .Goondiwindi: This paper didn’t say it
was morally or legally wrong for patriotic N.S.W.
M’s.P. to bleed their country of expenses for going
around telling people to be patriots and give their
lives to the nation. It regarded it chiefly as an
illustration of the amazing toughness of the hide of
the present generation of N. S. Wales politicians. . . .
C P.A.: You can call him the incenser if you like.
Or the nonsenser. We shall not be bothered to do
it. They annoy us sometimes ; but mostly nowadays
they are quite innocuous. The poor fellows must at
least make a pretence of doing something to save
the Empire, and we are rather grateful that they
can make that pretence while interfering so little

scribe a minute book it must be a joke. The co.
which would attempt to crowd through without such
a book is more likely to be a tragedy for someone.

worth illustrating. .. .Thos. McL.: Make “Prince

Dunno, (2) thanks for clip. .. .Hy Po: Nominate
the timber and we’ll see about it....lngle: Well,
the price-fixing has been a ghastly failure in N. S.
Wales. Hundreds of country people haven’t tasted
butter for months simply because the local store-
keeper (who mostly has to give a year’s credit and
often two years’) couldn’t land the grease at the
money he had to sell it f0r.... J.O’C.: Why not
recite it personally to the Kaiser ?... .H.M.K.: No,
it isn’t worth while. It is a casual, shambling

We got “saltpetre” to lie down in peace beside

to terms with “wrinkle”... .A.C.E.: You’ve made a
mistake; this isn’t a garbage destructor.... Dobbin:
Quite true that Pearce was declared by the officers
of the Department to be the best Defence Minister
that ever was. It begins to be doubtful whether
that wasn’t the worst testimonial a Minister could
have received... .R.C.C.: Of course we want to hear

Sam Mauger, president of the Vic. Alli-
ance, the body which assisted with all its
might to introduce the early closing of Mel-
bourne pubs, admits failure. “We have a
temporary measure,” said Samuel, at the
annual meeting, “but, notwithstanding this,
those who are making the greatest profits
out of the war expenditure in this country
are those associated with the liquor inter-
ests.” The Alliance consists mostly of one-
eyed citizens who scream at the very idea
of State management, and the time now
seems ripe for it to either propose a prac-
ticable alternative scheme or get out of the
reform business.
J. C. Watson’s scheme for securing em-
ployment for returned soldiers is disfigured
by the wretched device of land purchase.
Why Watson should try to make the Labor
party again identify itself with this make-
shift is incomprehensible. The very terms
in which it is suggested that the system
should be carried on —“it is expected that
payment could be arranged by long-dated
bonds” —is enough to condemn it. Has Aus-
tralia not a big enough load of bonds round
her neck already? In any case, if Australia
could go on stuffing Cohen’s pocket with
bonds from now till Doomsday, land pur-
chase for settlement purposes is a trumpery
process with which Conservatism should
alone be associated. It is not Labor policy
to ransom back the country in order that
its sons may find emnloyment. But it is
Labor policy to demand that the landlords
shall yield back to society that immense in-
crement their lands have acquired through
the expenditure of public money.
“The Pariah,” who knows his Asia: —
The German did more than send stuff to Australia;
he sent stuff to other countries—and why shouldn’t
we try to collar some of that trade? There is no
need to labor the advantage of our position as re-
gards at least the south of China, where the Hun
had the bulk of his business; but there is great need
for us to ask what our representative is doing to
keep our business men up to date with information.
When I was last in Hongkong an Australian bet me
that I would not be able to find the name of the
aforesaid rep. in any newspaper office either in that
particular oven or in Shanghai. Of seven papers
only one knew of his existence, and it had the
name wrong. That was a few years ago, but if the
position is any better now we ought to hear about it.
Yankee firms arc getting in and scoring new busi-
ness which should come to us. Things are done
differently by Japan. We have already had a well
informed and capable committee from that quarter,
and the firstfruits are already with us—mostly to
our disadvantage. Can’t we get busy, too —on some-
thing to our advantage?

Bill Hamilton, Minister for Mines, has
a discovery which he reckons worth
v i- • or so - • It happened this way.
Application had been made bv one of the
coal cos. at Ipswich for certain rights, and
in the course of inquiry it was found that
tie Crown had years ago reserved to itself
the minerals under a racecourse. In the
process of time the racecourse club got per-
mission to cut up the land and sell it. It
is calculated that there are four million
tons of coal under these lands. As the
Crown has been looking about for a mine of
its own—all the other coal-bearing lands in
the vicinity were grabbed by syndicates a
couple of generations ago—the value of the
discovery will be appreciated.
“ E .N ; M." ; The Light Horse Camp at
i hermside is a disgrace to the Defence De-
partment. A recent visit convinced me
that it must have been chosen by a major in
the horse-marines. Actually there is no
pioper training-ground, and no provision
>’ oi ; a Jttexnpt at, drilling the men with
horses. The place is divided into small
paddocks, in one of which the unfortunate
beasts, exposed to sun, wind and dust,
wander round disconsolately. The camp
itself is a poor affair at best, and quite un-
worthy of Queensland. The cooking
arrangements are conducive to waste, especi-
ally of meat, which is getting dearer and
dearer, and though the quality and quantity
of the food are all that they should be, one
undei stands, after a meal or two in camp,
the full force of the old Dutch proverb about
tiod sending meat and the Devil sending
cooks. A few ovens, such as those used
by country bakers, cheaply and easily con-
structed, are needed to replace the existing
system. One can hardly expect a tired De-
partment to tackle this subject, but the
whole camp-question really needs grappling
with. Instead of purchasing, or leasing, a
few hundred acres here and there at the end
of a tram-line, or near some suburban rail-
way station, the Defence Department should
secure several thousand acres of suitable
land, 15 or 20 miles at least from the cities —
land where there would be grass for stock,
where vegetables and fruit could be grown
for the men, and where there would be room
for a rifle-range, big drill and exercise
grounds, and sufficient variety of contour to
give men and horses a training. The only
people who profit by the existing system
seem to be trippers, tram cos. and publicans.
Had there been such an area available near
Brisbane during the past year we should not
be sending to. the Front men painfully short
of rifle-practice and mounted drill. The
Department might make a note of it that
Australia will need a good system after the
war quite as much as she needed it before
the war.

The fortune which has been waiting for
for the man who can devise a means
of settling Queensland’s prickly-pear pro-
blem is still going begging. Experiments
canied out at Dulacca have an appearance
of success, but the Prickly Pear Selectors’
Union, an organisation formed in the inter-
ests of the men who obtain land on the
undertaking that they will clear it of the
pest, is doubtful. It points out that land
trom which the pear appears to have been
eradicated blossoms with it again even after
other crops have been reaped. The union
contends that nothing but closer settlement
will stop the spread of prickly pear, and it
has therefore appealed to the Government
to give to “pear” selectors - first choice of
pear frontages. This would leave the
heavily cursed areas for the amusement of
experimenters, and make the “small” man’s
burden lighter.

BEFORE THE MIRROR.
By “JEANNETTE.”
“Jeannette,” the well-known writer on Beauty Culture and author of “The Book of Beauty,”
will be pleased to help and advise any reader dn matters of the toilet. Queries should be accom-
panied by a stamped addressed envelope, and directed to “Jeannette,” c/o “Before the Mirror,”.

These are undoubtedly days of exceptional nervous strain for one and all of
us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow over the
lives of many of us women, and while, perhaps, a few —the more stoical among
us —can avoid worrying over past or prospective events, we may all, with a little
care and forethought, succeed in preventing the result of worry from being notice-
able in our appearance. To these fortunate few this little chat will, however, be
as interesting and instructive as to those who stand in real need of help in toilet
matters, and may be the means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown
method of retaining, or regaining, that beauty of face and figure which is the birth-
right of every woman. Soma of the ingredients mentioned below are at present
not generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
Freckles aiul Hoiv to Cure Them. —lt is always
those with the finest and fairest skins who
freckle most easily, but this knowledge is poor
comfort when the face is disfigured with these
ugly little blemishes. To prevent the forma-
tion of freckles, a wash should be applied to
the face which will form a shield from the
rays of the sun. A simple and inexpensive
one can be made up at home by dissolving an
ounce of cleminite in four tablespoonfuls of
hot water. Shake the bottle, and when cold
apply to the face and allow to dry on the
skin. If this is done every day, renewing the
application whenever the face is washed, and a
Little mercolised wax rubbed into the skin
every night, freckles will not make their
appearance, no matter how hot the sun. To
remove freckles which have already formed,
apply the wax every night, rub it well into
the skin of the face and neck and leave it on
till the morning. Then wash off, using Pilenta
soap and warm water.
The Hair—To Increase the Growth. —To arrest
an undue falling of the hair and increase the
growth, scalp massage and the application of
a good tonic is absolutely necessary. Part the
hair in the centre, and starting at the forehead
massage for at least ten minutes. Then apply
a tonic. A simple and inexpensive one can be
made up at home by mixing one ounce of
boranium (which can be bought at the chem-
ist’s) with a quarter of a pint of bay rum.
Add the boranium to the bay rum, allow to
stand for half an hour, then strain and add
sufficient water to make half a pint. Dab
amongst the roots of the hair with a soft
sponge.
Blackheads, Enlarged Pores, etc. —Blackheads
are unusually troublesome things during the
summer months to those bothered in that way.
The extra warmth makes the skin “give,” and
it looks more greasy than usual, and conse-
quently the blackheads are more noticeable.
To remove them and close up the pores of the
skin dissolve a stymol tablet in a glass of hot
water, allow the effervescence to subside, then
dip a soft sponge into the liquid and bathe
the face. After a few minutes, dry the face
with a soft towel, and the blackheads will be
instantly removed.
To Reduce a Double Chin. —To reduce a double
chin, give hard, firm massage every night with
mercolised wax, stroking the flesh firmly back-
wards from the chin towards the lower portion
of the neck. Do this every night, and in the.
morning bathe with cold water and rub into
the skin a little parsidium jelly. J his treat-
ment will strengthen the flabby tissues anci
restore the contour of the face. Occasionally
a double chin is due to stooping over books or
work, but generally it is the result of putting
on weight. When the latter is the case a levs
clynol berries, eaten regularly every day, will
greatlv assist in reducing the superfluous
flesh. ' A glass of hot water should be sipped
after each meal.
Superfluous Hair. —Dark-complexioned women
are far more frequently troubled with a
growth of superfluous hair than those with
fair skins, and at the first sign of these objec-
tionable hairs steps should be taken to remove
them, or tliev will develop into a strong
growth which will take a very long time to
destrov. A little powdered plieminol applied
to this growth will remove the unsightly blem
ish, destroying it permanently if the hairs be
but few. Two or more applications may be
necessary if the growth be unusually strong,
but about one ounce of plieminol should be
sufficient for the most stubborn case, riiemi-
nol can be obtained at the chemist’s, and a
little powdered alum should be obtained at the
same time for dusting the skin before applying
the plieminol.
Grey or Fading Hair.—To restore the color to
grey or fading hair add one ounce of concen-
trate of tammalite to four ounces "of bay rum.
Apply to the roots with a soft sponge every
night until the desired result is obtained, then
use the lotion two or three times a week. After
three or four days a decided improvement will
be noticed, the hair turning gradually to its
original color. An iron tonic will be found
most beneficial when the gre'yness is caused by
general debility.
Beautiful Hair—How to Shampoo.—Whether
the liair is luxuriant and glossy, or thin and
lanky depends very largely upon the care
bestowed upon it. To keep the hair in good
condition it should be shampooed once in
every two or three weeks. Before shampooing,
massage a little pure olive oil or almond oil
into the scalp, then mix one teaspoonful of
stallax granules .411 a cup of hot water, fill a
basin with warm water, into which the ends
of the hair can fall, and shampoo the stallax
; mixture into the scalp in the usual way.
Rinse, and dry by fanning with a palm fan, or
! in the open air, if the weather permits. Should
j the hair be naturally very greasy, the oil
1 massage should be emitted. " [3

“Rosna” : The Honk, that gay little
regimental rag edited by Corporal Phil
Harris —“Philo,” of The Bulletin —and
now of the Australian Divisional Ammuni-
tion Park, “somewhere in France,” has
made its first appearance on the actual field
of slaughter. Former numbers were pub-
lished on the transport coining over. But
the British Censor —the D.A.P. is now with
a British division —won’t allow the present
issue to go outside the war zone. Presum-
ably it contains priceless secrets about the
number of sausages the British army can
consume when put to it. Of the “subs” of
former issues two, Lieut. Imlay and Private
A. L. Brewer, were’ wounded in the early
days at the Dardanelles, so Corpl. Phil has
had to seek a new staff.

Stanley Hall stepped out of the S. M.
Herald office the other day after over dO
years’ service there. He did nothing aston-
ishingly brilliant; most of the years in
which he might have done something strik-
ing he spent, instead, in a hard grind so
that daughter Elsie, the pianist, might do
the brilliant things. Heaven only knows
Whether it was worth the cheerful struggle:
she performed before a few kings, taught a
few princelings and then married a man in
the middle of Africa. Before joining the
Herald the very dependable Hall ran a
paper in Fiji and had something to do with
the British annexation of the island.
“J.F.” : Succumbed with startling sudden-
ness, after an operation, Walter Emanuel,
the sprightly young Jew who for a dozen
years has written the first page of London
Punch. His weekly collection of whim-
sical comments on passing events was the
only thing in Punch that many people
looked at —excepting always the paper’s
excellent drawings. Emanuel kept at his
whimsies up to the hour when he submitted
himself to the knife, and his page appeared
as usual on the day of his death. He was
not a member of the staff, but a London
solicitor who preferred to hold on to the
tidy practice he had pulled together before
he began this press work. Since the out-
break of the war he had also been a special
constable, and a chill thus contracted did
the mischief.

The Argus in its fiery youth of 1854 and
thereabouts was a regular devil, and pub-

Ave! it must come, and the tyrant s throne
Is crumbling with our hot tears rusted....

Ye cannot stay the opening day,
The world goes on, the light grows stronger ;
The people’s advent’s coming.
After that Hotspur grew aweary and became
a suburban mayor and a J.P.

“S.T.S.” : One of the smallest books of
verse on record (5| x 3|, and only eight
pages) comes from Egypt, where it has
been produced by Signaller Skeyhill—for-
merly known as a successful elocutionist in
the Ballarat competitions. As a parodist
he is well enough ; but in serious work he
is—well, he writes things like this :
I’ve often passed those little mounds
Where the deadly bullets meow :
And the air was full of shrapnel—
’Trs called Shrapnel Gully now.
What is selling the booklet (and it lias had
a tremendous sale among the Australians in
Egypt) is a savage summing-up, i'h the
manner of Dennis’s Sentimental Bloke, of
the stay-at-home brigade: —
’E reads ther Mobnin" ’Eralb,
Ah’ sees thcr Turks is on ther run..
Then ’e brags about Australia,
An’ wot ’er boys ’ave done.
’E shines before ther barmaids,
’E’s gpod at beery skitin’,
But round ther corner of ther street
Is where ’e does ’is fig’ntin’!
The unfortunate bard has lost: the sight of
both eyes—only temporarily, it is hoped.

Vance Palmer, the Queenslander wlna has

book.

Ilenry Lawson foresaw Gallipoli. This
is from “A Hero ip Dingo Scrubs,” pub-
lished in 1902: —
These lanky, sawny bushmen will do things in an
easy-going way some day that'll mgke the old world
sit up and think hard.
Lawson, by the. way, is getting himself
braced up in the Walker Convalescent Hos-
pital. and finding “heaps of material” in a
Corner where he never looked for it before.

Rescued from fire in a boot factory at
Invercargill (M.L.) lately’ was a copy of a
sheet called the Nokomai Herald, pub-
lished in Invercargill in 1871, at Is. per
head. The edition is a very youthful one
(No. 2), and, in the absence of printing
presses, the four pages had been laboriously
written out with pen and ink. It is now
on its way to, the Otago, Early Settlers'
Museum.

Since so many of Maoriland's telegraphists
have left for the Dardanelles country editors
have been having a wild time. The press
messages are now mostly transmitted with
a hammer and saw, and in the middle of
observations about meat they are liable to
fly off into unintelligible remarks, and the
harassed country rag can never be sure
whether it’s merely another error or the
name of a new town that the Russian Bear
has called at.

This contention is substantiated by millions of horsepower of G.E. and B.T-TI. Motors
successfully doing industrial, farm, office and domestic service throughout the
world. The users of these motors are receiving handsome returns on their

THE STEWART
HANDY WORKED
A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL
USEFUL TOOLS IN ONE.
Just the thing for the Home Workshop,
Farm Workshop. Store or Garage.
If- you do your own repair- work in home
workshop, store or garage, here is a device
which you absolutely need. It will greatly
simplify and improve your work.
All you have to do is, holt it to table or
working bench and it is ready for work.
There is a strong, powerful vice with a
jaw opening of 4J inches. The jaws are 4
inches in width and will hold any wood or
metal article firmly and securely.
There is a pipe vice which will grip pipe
up to 11 inches in diameter.
There is an anvil, strongly and substan-
tially made, and a steel cutting hardie for cutt-
ing wire or steel.
There is a drill press which can be operated
at two speeds. There are two drills and a
rest to hold the job to the drill.
There is a carborundum grinding wheel
which will keep the edges of your wood or
metal-cutting tools in tip-top shape. It has
three speeds : direct, 4 to 1 and 16 to 1.
The materials used are ol first quality, so
that you can count upon the Stewart Handy
Worker lasting a lifetime. The gearing is
cut from solid steel bar ; so are the two cutting
drills furnished. Taken all in all, this wonder-
ful tool has no equal in quality, workmanship
and utility.
Here is a workshop equipment in itself
which, with all the features and attachments
above enumerated, you can buy from your
Storekeeper for 15 S . Complete.

An Edison
Storage
Battery
has nearly double the - -
capacity of a lead battery
of the same weight. - -
This not only means a clear saving in some
cases of five or six hundred pounds of battery
weight, but enables the vehicle builder to
lighten his vehicle in proportion, thereby
saving enormously in wear and tear.
The care necessary to obtain the very best
results with the Edison Storage Battery is of
the simplest nature—the occasional addition
of pure distilled water to the cells. It needs
no expert attention whatever.
Write for full details of this exceptionally'
reliable Storage Battery, and please state the
purpose you need batteries for.
Our modern plant enables us to re-charge
these batteries at lowest rates. Prices on

THOMAS A. EDISON, LTD.,
364-372 Kent Street, Sydney.
E. A. (“Nulla”) Roberts, killed at Galli-
poli, besides being one of the most popular
of Sydney solicitors, was a conspicuously
fine athlete. As a youngster at King’s
School, Parramatta, he was a topnotcher;
then he played Rugby Union football,
and took rep. honors; later on the golf
microbe got in the blood. Arriving at the
Front he had barely time to look round
before a bullet found him.
The One Big Union idea, which was given
a jolt when the N. S. Wales Registrar
stopped the amalgamation of the Railway
Workers and the A.W.TJ. on the ground of
an ineffective ballot, is getting into its stride
again. The executives of the two concerns
are conferring, and have already agreed that
tickets for one are to be recognised by the
other. The movement ought to be blessed,
(if course; but the blessing is withheld pend-
ing proof that the Big Union proposes to obey
the law and not flout it. So far, the bigger
the union the less disposed has it been to
give Arbitration a chance. Which has been
cruel to the poor little under-dog unions, for
Arbitration is the only hope they have.
This is insisted on with the emphasis of
large type in the official argument justifying
the amendment of the Constitution :
We are at war, but the money-lender insists upon
his interest. The cost of living has risen. Employ-
ment is becoming scarce.
Now it is to be hoped someone will tell the
politicians that the way to dodge interest is
not to sign the p.n.; that employment is
scarce because the politicians have neglected
the tariff; that the cost of living in Aus-
tralia is not half as big a scandal as the
cost of seven Parliaments, cocked hats, re-
freshment rooms and Ushers of the Black
Rod. Now what do they propose to do
about those things? Or, rather, when are
they going to do something about those
things? They have proposed to do some-
thing too long already.
That ponderous periodical, N.S.W. Gov-
ernment Gazette, published on October 3
the usual statement of the General Loan
Account. Recent expenditure totals
£1,631,788 3s. lOd. To show the deadly
earnestness with which N. S. Wales loads
the bill on to our stand-by, posterity, wit-
ness items such as these: —

FACE GREATLY
Suffered Twelve Months. Caused
Much Pain. Used CuticuraSoap
and Ointment. Soon Healed.
MuUengandra, Via Albury. N. S. W.—
“For twelve months 1 suffered a great deal
with a rash. At first there appeared on my
face an itchy red patch which caused mo
much pain and it disfigured my face greatly.
At first I thought that it was only a rash
but after a time the trouble became so irri-
tating that I was advised to try some oint-
ment. This I did but without success.
“I got the Cuticura Soap and also some
Cuticura Ointment and applied them as
directed and almost immediately after
using the Cuticura Soap and Ointment my
face began to get better. So I continued
using them both and soon I was completely
cured of this nasty rash.” (Signed) Miss
Grace Black, May 11, 1914.

PEBECO
Tooth Paste.
If our teeth could talk ; —they
would say something like this:
“Yes, we are thankful for our
friends—the millions of Tooth
Brushes. They do a splendid
work—so far as they go. We
are grateful for the hundreds of
dentifrices. They in turn do a
splendid work —so far as they go.
But both together fall far short of
protecting our enamel —our only
weapon of tooth protection. Is
there no escape from these
‘MOUTH ACIDS’ —these ever-
present mouth fluids which, un-
seen, unbidden, are working day
and night to break down our
armor plate—and then make the
soft inside tooth structure easy
prey to decay-germs?”
We answer:
“There IS escape from ‘Acid
Mouth.’ Pebeco Tooth Paste is
the one dentifrice to-day which
prevents ‘Acid Mouth’ —the direct
cause of 95 % of all tooth-decay.”

By using Mellin’s Food and fresh cow’s milk you
retain the important vital properties of the fresh milk
and so ‘humanise’ the milk that it becomes similar to
mother’s milk. Mellin’s Food does this most perfectly.
It is this ‘humanising’ power which accounts for the

“War”: I was shown last week by a
manufacturer a few miles from Sydney
samples of spokes and pick- and hammer-
handies made from spotted gum and other
local timbers. They were well finished and
seemed in every respect equal to the im-
ported Yankee article, and could be sold at
about half the money. City wholesalers
had, nevertheless, turned them down be-
cause they could not be bothered to make a
market for them. Wonderful are the ways
of patriotism ! Now, here’s a job for a per-
manent Made-in-Australia committee an
organisation to which a little man lpight go
for advice as to how to get his product to
the buyers. The little man usually comes
a cropper because he doesn t know the right
people to go to. # ,
“Warre” : Mention of the shocking lack of
co-operative spirit among the cookies of
X. S. Wales reminds me of the fate or an
inland co-operative butter factory a few
years ago. The president was the boss
cocky of the district, also the largest sup-
plier of milk. Suddenly his cans ceased
journeying to the co-op. and started going
to a private factory in another town, which
had fished for him with an extra tuppence
a gallon and hooked him. The explosion
which followed was so terrific that the
remains of the co-op. factory have not yet
come to earth. I met a wheat cocky the
other day, an erstwhile advocate of co-
operation. who denounced the principle as
all wrong. Had he not bought a bag of
sugar from the storekeeper 6d. cheaper than
he could get it from the co-op. society in
which he had a couple of shares'?

“D.F.”: All the financiers don’t go into

scheme fox* carrying but public works, -the
Trust saved up a bit out of. revenue from
road rates, and after that, if any of the
constituents wanted a road, the Trust lent
him or them the necessary money, charging
5 per cent, interest. Once the scheme got
going the public works policy of that pai-
ticular body was self-supporting, and the
Trust was never worried by doubts about
whether its public works were reproductive
or not; it knew they were. The thing
worked well for a while; and then someone
pointed out that it was illegal or something,
and the pearl of an idea was dropped.

By way of protest against the unfulfilled
prediction of a water famine which circu-
lated a year ago, Melbourne Board ot
Works has put forth an illustrated book
showing the three water-supply systems
whereon the city -relies for its daily wash.
The book contains reassuring letterpress as
well as pleasing pictures ; also, the announce-
ment that a volume dealing with the sewage
system will be published later on.. It seems
that the much-abused Board, since taking
control in 1891, has spent £1,316,000 on
construction work; and an explanation of
what the Board has to show for all that
money seems, all things considered, a per-
missible extravagance. # #
A calculation has been made in London
of the cost of a reconstructed man. A pair
of artificial legs costs about £3O and a pair
of arms about £2O. Ears, all shapes, with
good, serviceable drums, cost £lo each.
Eyes, all colors, are quoted at £6 a pair.
Without heart, brains or bowels a man is
worth about £lOO. # ,
Says an agricultural editor in a Mel-
bourne weekly: “It is now Australia s
bounden duty to set to work, and with all
her knowledge and energy restore her sheep
flocks and re-establish her wool and meat
industries upon the old footing.” .Revenow
a nos moutons, in short.

“R. Me.”: Derrink a burning question?
Well, consider Mundooran, on the Castle-
reagli (N.S.W.). There are two pubs there,
one owned by J. Byrnes, the other by 11. W.
Byrnes Along came another Byrnes the
other day and bought 11. W. out, the legal
work being done by a solicitor named Burns.
THE PHARISEE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He prayed, as did that Pharisee of old
In solemn strain to listening Deity:
“I thank Thee, (tod, I am as other men,
No better and no worse. I sometimes lie;
L pilfer in a strictly legal way ;
I take the unearned increment where’er
And whensoe’er I see I safely can ;
I spill no mortal's blood, although men shed
Their daily sweat to build my lordly pile ;
And here and there I do a kindly act.
I cherish all my children, love my wife,
And hanker not for Naboth’s little plot
Or brave Uriah’s frail and beauteous bride.
Of Envy, Hatred, Malice and the like
I own I have my tidy mortal share.
But as for boasting I am not as others,
But built of some superior clod or clay
I’m not so deadly foolish.
Thou, O Lord,
Hast made me as I am, and Thou must bear
The burden of my follies and my virtues.
That Hebrew ass who brayed of self-made goodness,
Within that Jewish Temple fair of old,
Relieved Thee of a heavy load, 0 Maker,
But 1 am not so kind.”
Then rose
That other wight, as did the Publican.
•‘Behold in me,” he softly said, “O Lord,
A worm who walks in dust east-down and vile;
Who knows himself the chief of hapless sinners.
And therefore seeks Thine aid. Beyond my fellows
How deeply have I fallen! In the dirt
Long have I grovelled low, and were it not
Thou didst extend a special helping Hand
To drag me forth o’ the mire, there lay 1 yet,
A mate for maggot comrades. Chosen now
1 stand at Thy right hand to show how great
Hath been Thy saving grace! - ’
Then said the Lord:
“O Voice Abject! Thy proud humility
Hath solved a mighty problem troubling Me,
And rid the lleav'ns of grave perplexity;
For, till thy speech had closed its vaunting span,
In maze and doubt the Mind Immortal ran
Which was the Pharisee, the Publican?”

MARCUS-CLARKB.
(l { rom a photo.)
Another Tribute to Rexona
Miss Marian Marcus-Clarke, the favorite Actress, is the youngest daughter of Marcus Clarke,
whose thrilling novel, “For the Term of His Natural Life,” has made him world famous. Miss
Marcus-Clarke made her name in America as “Mrs. Whipple’’ in Jack Mason’s success, “The
M itching Hour,” and as “Martha” in “The Holy Citv.” Returning to her native land,
Australia, she played all the principal character parts with the Fred Niblo-Josephine Cohan Co.
Miss Marcus-Clarke writes to us from the Criterion Theatre:—
I am dropping you a line to tell you how good I have found Rexona Soap. As a
skin beautifier and as a shampoo for the hair I have never found anything nearly so
good, and it is delightfully refreshing. Everyone I have recommended it to has been
so pleased with it. I have also used Rexona Ointment. It is excellent, and I think
there is nothing on the market that in any way approaches the Rexona Remedies.
I wish yon much success with them. Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) MARIAN MARCUS-CLARKE.
REXONA The FAMILY FRIEND.
Rexona Soap and Ointment are universal favorites with everyone who values
healthy skin. The longer you neglect your skin the harder it will be to care for
may result in Eczema, Psori-
asis, Ringworm, Runnin g-
Sores, or some of the many
and unpleasant forms that skin
trouble so often assumes.
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, and
Rexona Soap are sure preserva-
tives for the health and skin.
Rexona Soap keeps the skin
soft and pure, and Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, will immedi-
ately eradicate any disease
which may be apparent, for it
arouses the skin to healthy
activity so that it quickly
recuperates and the diseased
skin becomes once more sound
and liealthjr. Rexona is sold

The Gods Who Are Gone and
the Gods Who Remain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A PERFECT night, no wind, no cloud ;
Dee]) purple skies decked out with
stars—
The funeral pall to gods allowed
Whom Earth once knew as avatars;
The cool, clear silence all around
Prims to the world's remotest bound.
No man could look on such a night
Unmoved by its surpassing peace
And glory. ’Tis as though the might
Of God had ordered Strife to cease
And all His worlds from East to West
From North to South —to be at rest!
la yon unfathomable well
Of crystal ether, gemmed with suns,
Wherein vast constellations dwell
And the superb Galaxy runs —
Beyond the reach of mortal gaze
Reign all the Gods of Elder Days.
Great Jove, the King of Heaven, is there;
His feebler thunders left behind ;
A starry realm, s.> vast, so fair
Delights him to his inmost mind;
Freed from all greed and lust and war,
Jove holds high state for evermore!
Athene, beautiful and wise,
Rules a more rare and radiant sphere ;
With laughter in her frank grey eyes
She laid aside her shield and spear
Long, long ago ! The endless hours
For her are filled with feast and flowers.
Poseid m, Foul of Earth’s small seas,
Who drove his dolphins through the foam,
Enjoys eternities of ease
In his celestial mountain-home;
Where stormy waters never roar
He prunes star-clusters by the score!
Apollo, ever fair and young,
Best-loved by all the sons of men,
Since he left Earth has never sung,
And vows he will not sing again ;
His lyre and bow lie idle ; he
Is shepherding young Nebulae !
Majestic Juno, Heaven’s proud Queen —
Voluptuous in Olympian years—
Dwells in a distant star serene
Where never jealous hate appears,
And passes countless peaceful hours
Amid her golden bees and flowers!
And Mercury, Jove’s herald bright,
The graceful, smiling, roguish god,
Is seen no more in helm of light.
Now with his winged sandals shod.
In lilac glades where fountains play
He dreams Eternity away!
And Venus —ah. divine, supreme.
Immortal! —what deal- star doth hold?
The constellated orbs that gleam
From pole to pole in burnished gold
Know not if she doth reign, or live.
Or is on Earth a fugitive.
Of all the glorious company
That gathered round Imperial Jove
To rule, or feast with ecstasy
In the Olympian halls above,
But two passed not beyond the stars —
Fair, wandering Venus, and fierce Mars !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH no, it's not the war. It’s a story
that points a moral: Never be a
gentleman to a lady unless you in-
tend to marry her.
Five years ago I met an innocent, lily-
white flower from the country. Her virtue
would have made a nun’s look cheap. For
three successive nights I made a pretence
of being a gentleman, and I actually made
her think I teas a gentleman. That’s how I
fell. To-day I lie enmeshed —hopelessly
enmeshed.
It happened so simply. It always does.
What I then thought was her innocence I
now think was her crudity. It was never
her cunning, for she had no artistry about
her. But it's all the same now.
In those three nights I kissed her only 33
times. She never kissed me once. Out-
wardly she was quite passive. I tired. She
didn’t. I went away. That was all. At
least I’m almost sure that was all.
For five years I never saw her, though
she Avrote frequently. I never replied. No,
there was nothing brazen about her. She
simply trusted me implicitly, and pardoned
or overlooked my neglect. Being a cour-
teous man I sent her five printed Christmas
cards, one each year. While I was sending
her the Christmas cards 1 got hopelessly en-
gaged to another, and I’m most happy in
my hopelessness even unto the present time.
That’s the position.
Three days ago she called on me. I
gulped—and smiled. An iceberg would
have been frozen. I afternoon-tea’d her and
got away as soon as I could, weakly excus-
ing myself and mumbling that I hoped I
Avould see her soon again.
She called again this morning—just
looked at me and Avaited for me to do some-
thing. I frantically seized my hat and
vaguely hurried her street-Avards. Then I
paused to try to think. I recollected an
urgent appointment with a man who had
forged some cheques. She continued look-
ing but didn’t say a word. I was con-
quered, and I walked her any old hoAv into
and out of lanes and byAvays and highways.
At last she commenced talking. I merely
had to listen and interpose a few “Yeses”
and “Noes” and “Oh reallys,” and think of
Avays and means of getting free.
I Avas brought to when she Avas in the
middle of some patter about the recent trans-
gressions of an elder brother. It appeared
that he had just been married to a clergy-
man’s daughter of whom his family did not
approve. AnyhoAV, that’s about the last I
remember before the final bell Avent
“And mother sent her best love to you”
(as Heaven is my witness I’ve never seen
the woman). "They—they often ask me at
home if we’re really engaged, and,” shyly, "I
don’t know what to tell them exactly.”
(Don’t laugh, you silly fools, don’t laugh
—it’s a major tragedy. Can’t you see there’s
no escape for me?)
I pulled my face together and made a
miserable, utterly-futile attempt to look
grave and deadly earnest and secretly sor-
rowful. 1 told her 1 was already married
to a certain extent elsewhere, and. more-
over, that my reputation was so muddy that
I was unfit to kiss her feet. Then, fool of
fools, I laughed !
The laugh was the laugh of sheer hysteria
and utter despair; but I saw she thought I
was trying to be funny or something.
Tersely, my burning words had cut no ice.
As I turned to flee under some horrible
pretence she said she would tell them at
home how happy I was.
I shall have to murder her. It will be
better for my future wife and for me. And
for her —she was made to mix only with
angels.

occupants of the yard. Two of these walked
with dragging steps and down-bent heads.
They were defaulting bank clerks. Another
slouched stolidly on his way with expres-
sionless eyes; lie was committed for in-
decent assault. And one walked with
greedy, unblinking eye’s turned to the little
patch of blue sky that canopied the place
of shame. This was a slim, strong French
Canadian with a round face and clear eyes
as blue as the sky he watched. He was in
for murder of the woman he had loved.
Once again Chalmers was going over the
details of his flight and his arrest. If
that wharf-laborer had not recognised him
he would have been safe now on his way to
Norway. If he had told Jupp twelve hours
sooner of the state of his affairs, Jupp could
have raised the money. God ! If only he
had sold out when he found he was losing
ground ! Forgery ! They could give a man
life for that. And the Raw Society had
got hold of the deed, lie wondered what
Jack ilaliam had thought, sitting there,
with his thin shoulders hunched. Had he
thought of the nights they had swatted
together, or of how Chalmers had bucked
him up and kept him to scratch before their
final ? Struck from the rolls after all his
hard work! Five years at least —and
struck from the rolls ! Why hadn’t he been
content to stick to serving behind a counterV
His family had put him to it. lie remem-
bered his apprenticeship days—how tall and
raw-boned he had been, his wrists always
too long for the ready-to-wear suits old
Maclean stocked. Douglas had been at the
next counter, and how he had admired
Douglas ! Heaven! how he had loathed the
shop. He used to watch the boys and girls
on tlieir way to the High Schools, and he
envied them. Then one day he had to go to
court to give evidence concerning some
theft, and at once he had known that he
would be a lawyer.
Thank Heaven, he'd be out of this to-
morrow. Douglas and Howden would bail
him. How lie loved Howden and admired
Douglas! Yes, sir; there were two men
for you. Friendsf Well, he should say
so! He threw back his shoulders and
swung round with a sudden jauntiness that
drew from the others looks of envy. He’d
be bailed out to-morrow for certain. The
warders said so quite openly. That sort
always had moneyed friends who stuck to
them. One of the bank clerks looked around
wearily. He wondered how Jo and the kid
were managing. Two sureties of £5O each,
and himself in a hundred ! God ! Nobody’d
do it for him! He’d like to see the kid
again—and Jo. He wondered if she’d stick
to him. She was so pretty, and had such
a dashing way with her. A warder called
to him, and he was taken from the yard—
not to be seen again by the others till the
day of his trial, when his wife —tear-
stained, followed every motion of the Judge
with such pitiful intensity that twelve
months’ hard was commuted to six months
without.
By the next afternoon the other bank
clerk had been taken away by friends. Now
Chalmers walked in company with a mur-
derer, and the something infinitely worse
than a murderer. Howden would come in
the afternoon train, he told himself, and
no doubt Douglas was waiting for him to
arrive. Wouldn’t he be glad to get out!
One of his well-cut Oxfords was scraped
by the jagged stone in the right-hand corner
near the wall. “In Debtors’ Yard the
stones are hard,” he quoted grimly, eyeing
the bruised leather. In the distance a train
whistled—the 4.10. Howden would be in
that. There was a man for you—such charm
—such breeding! A perfect specimen of
the output of an English Public School!
His code of honor! Why, it did a man good
to know Howden —and then, what a play-
fellow he was! Come to think of it, he’d
never known how to play till he’d met Ilow-
den. He’d been such a serious, ambitious
Prig.
The next afternoon, and the next, and
still the next, Chalmers walked the prison
yard. His eyes had lost some of their con-
fidence, and the warders saw the ugly thing
called Fear lurking in their depths. Pacing
slowly up and down there flashed before him
the crowds of “Good fellows” who had drunk
his whisky and won his money at cards.
He thought of the women—smiling, alluring
with whom he had flirted, and now not a
sign from one of them. Even the thing
unspeakable had had friends to come for-
ward and stand by it. But he who had set
out with such hopes and high ambition was
walled in, beneath a square of God’s bine
sky, in company with a murderer.

Backache Days and Backache Nights
Do you realise that Pains in the Back, Limbs or Joints, Weak Heart, Irritability,
Languor, Sleeplessness, Urinary Troubles are Symptoms of Kidney Weakness?
*

r
* Every
Picture
Tells a
Story ”
Kidney disease comes on quietly and may take 3x311 unawares, for often
its symptoms are put down to other causes —a serious mistake in many cases.
Karly symptoms are pain in the back and groin, bladder irritation, stiff or
aching limbs, scarcity or excess of urine, sediment, night sweats — chilly, moist
or swollen extremities drowsiness, blurred sight, dizziness and morbid depression.
For when diseased the kidneys fail to purify the blood, so that uric acid
and waste matter collecff in the system, causing rheumatism, stone, dropsy,
gravel, sciatica, lumbago and other complications.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are a tonic for the kidneys, which they
heal and strengthen, enabling these all-important organs to rid the system of
poisonous deposits that are setting up disease throughout the body.
Keep tlie kidneys well and they will keep 3-011 well, but you must get
the right medicine.
SERIOUS KIDNEY TROUBLE CURED.
DROPSY, BACKACHE AND URINARY DISORDER.
Mrs. W. Ben 11, 12 Turner Street, Redfern, Sydney, says“l am finite convinced that I owe my
life to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, for this remedy cured me of dropsy and other symptoms of
disordered kidneys. My ill-health started with backache, then I got urinary trouble and dropsy. My
back was always aching, the sharp, shooting pains being so bad I would have hot flannels put on to
try and get ease. The secretions were thick, and caused intense pain. I was fit for nothing, feeling
tired out always, and 1. had bad headaches. My legs and feet swelled to twice their natural size; l
could not put my boots on, and I practically lost the use of my legs. I was really very ill, and
nobody thought I would ever get well. I tried every remedy I could hear of, but got no better. The
doctors whom I consulted could do me no good, and gave up my case as hopeless. A friend advised
me to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and I procured some. The first few bottles gave me relief,
and twelve bottles completed my cure. I am now quite free of the dropsy and backache, and the
secretions are regulated. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have cured me completely and perma-
nently, for I have been quite well for two and a half years now. I cannot suflicienly praise Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills; they saved my life.”
Mrs. Benn makes a second statement five years later:—“l am pleased to add that I have had no
return of dropsy or any other symptom of kidney trouble since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me over seven years ago.”

Pies and Passion.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ml' friend Miss Simpson told me the
story of Maudie’s love affair in
nightly instalments, while I ate late
dinners in the upstairs room at Smithwick’s.
Bveryone knows Smithwick's, where one
gets a large, nourishing pie, a pot of tea
and a deafening for sixpence. But few
know it when the crash of cutlery on marble
slabs, the scraping of chairs, the shrill
shrieks of Pie and tea one !” are over for
the day, and only a yawning cashier and a
weary waitress lurk in shadowy corners of
the big empty room. Pew, too, have soft-
ened the hearts of Smithwick’s girls, who
are, for the most part, cold and distant.
( ertainly they always serve men before
women, hut in a manner that suggests
obedience _to some law of nature rather
than the indulgence of a preference.
I am a mild, inoffensive person, and new
acquaintances treat me with confidence or
indifference, according to their individual
n ? e J s - Realising that, with a long period
dinners looming ahead, indifference
noni Miss Simpson would mean starvation,
1 laid myself out to win her confidence, and
1 am happy to say succeeded, though on the
lirst night The frail barque of my hopes
was nearly wrecked on a misunderstanding.
I ordered sw r eet corn. Miss Simpson
hi ought me pork and beans. I protested
mildly.
That is sweet corn." said Miss Simpson,
gazing fixedly over my head.
"Pardon me, but it appears to me to be
pork and beans, a dish I dislike exceedingly,”
I said.
"It is sweet corn,” said Miss Simpson,
with marked coldness.
I saw ruin and disaster and an endless
succession of tepid dinners. I hate cold
plates, and I surrendered. I apologised
abjectly. And then I asked for pork and
beans, and Miss Simpson forgave me and
brought me sweet corn, and all was well.
A fcwv nights later I wanted sweet corn
again. So I ordered pork and beans, and
to my horror .Miss Simpson brought them,
her eyes challenging mine defiantly. Mv
fate trembled in the balance, but a call from
the kitchen saved me. Miss Simpson dis-
appeared. Reside me was an open window.
Below stretched the verandah roof. When
Miss Simpson returned the dish w-as empty.
I noticed some plumbers working at flic
spouting next day, but it wanted cleaning
out in any case.
After that we avoided sweet corn bv
mutual consent, and Miss Simpson brought
me steaming dinners on red-hot plates, and
gave me minute details of the character
and family history of herself and the other
girls.
One night she rushed up with no trace of
her usual queenly calm. and. holding the
menu upside down two inches from my
glasses, said: “What do you think? Maudie
has a boy!”
I disentangled ray eyes, which had be-
come crossed, and replied, “You don’t say
so !” I was sparring for time. Smithwick’s
girls ai’e as undistinguishable to me sepa-
rately as dress-baskets to a luggage porter.
But it would never have done to say so.
(I hate cold plates.) I knew that if the
incident was to be considered as humorous,
Miss Simpson would explosively ejaculate
“Laugh!” at frequent intervals —remini-
scently, and not as a command. I had found
the habit very helpful.
“Yes,” she said. “Fancy old Maudie!
Laugh ! My word! While there’s life
there’s hope, as they say. Mind you, though,
I’m glad.”
“Maudie?” I said thoughtfully.
“Oh, you know Maudie !” said' Miss Simp-
son with a touch of impatience. “The long
slab of a girl with a nice, kind face, like a
cow, that waited on you on my night off.
Not that faces are everything.” (Miss
Simpson is not pretty.) “But she has no
figger or anything. She’s like an ineing
board.”
Miss Simpson ran an approving glance
down the generous curve of her own apron
bib.
“Oh. ah, yes. Of course, I know now.
But I was wondering where you had gone,
and hoping there was nothing wrong, so I
didn’t notice her very closely.”
Ordinarily Miss Simpson would have in-
quired if I wanted to borrow half a crown.
She might even have been alarmed. She
has frequently assured me that a girl can’t
be too careful. But she ignored the per-
sonal application and hurried on :
“Yes. Well, fancy her with a boy 1”
“Surely ‘her days are in the sere and
yellow leaf,’ ’’ I ventured.
Miss Simpson playfully offered to take
two tickets on that one, and requested me
to come to earth. I obeyed, and suggested
that Miss Maud was getting a bit old for
that sort of thing. Miss Simpson agreed
heartily, and estimated Maudie’s age at
about a hundred not out.
“Mind you. though, sometimes they get it
worse when they are old. I’ve often' noticed
that.”
“Henry .Tames lias written a book. ‘The
Dangerous Age.’ ” I said. “That”
.“Perhaps he has,” said Miss Simpson.
“But what I say is wliat’s the use of sticking
inside seven or eight nights reading a book
when you can* go to the pitchers and see it
all done in a couple of hours, and music and
all? Anyway, I noticed there was some-
thing uji about Maudie. Slic’d keep edging
up to the glass and giving her old hair a
poke, and wiping away at the corner table,
and watching the door”
At this stage Miss Simpson interrupted
herself to ask what I was going to have.
Being unable to read upside-down, I did not
know, but suggested thick soup. Miss
Simpson brought me clear, and, ordering me
not to eat that old bread, brought a fresh
loaf from the next table. I hate fresh
bread.
“Well. I've been watching, out, and sure
enough there is a chap coming to her table
by himself every day. He’s—oo—ever so
much younger than her. But he’s a very
gentleman’,y young feller, and awfully nice
to Maudie. and ’pon me word I begin to
wonder if there’s something doing. Of
course in our business you never know. A
feller may like that table because it’s out
of the draught, or there’s a good light to
read his paper, or anything; and if he finds
that the girl’ll fall over herself to bring him
his lunch before anyone else it’s only
natural that he’ll keep on coming. Oo well,
I’ll tell you how it goes.”
“I can’t quite make him out.” said Miss
Simpson a few nights later. “He’s as nice
as pie to Maudie, and he’s got her so she’ll
eat out of his hand. We do give her a time
about him!”
“How unkind of you !” I said.
Miss Simpson was quite surprised. “Why,
if you don’t jolly a girl a bit when she’s got
a boy she’d think you was jealous. Maudie’s
as pleased as a little dog with two tails if
she can get anyone to tease her about
George.”
“And why do you say you can’t under-
stand him?”
“Well. I don’t know. The way he goes
on you’d think he had tickets on Maudie,
but you never know. He may be one of
these fellers that go on like that just be-
cause they like to see people jolly round
them.”
“A bit of an altruist,” I suggested.
“Oh no, I don’t think he’s a wowser,”
said Miss Simpson.
About a week later she rushed up, seeth-
ing with excitement and suppressed news.
“My word, there’s been doings here to-
day! What are you going to have?”
“Beef,” I answered promptly. An in-
stant’s pause to consult the menu would
have been fatal. I think I mentioned before
that I hate cold plates. Miss Simpson sped
like an arrow from the kitchen and slammed
down the beef.
“My word, yes! 'You should have been
here ! You know Em’ly and I used to pull
Maudie’s leg and say ‘Oo ! George has just
come in with such a nice girl!’ and Maudie’d
laugh and say, ‘Oh yes. I know you!’ Beall y
she was getting a bit over the odds the way
she hung around him, and I suppose he
thought so, too. Anyway I was inside get-
ting coffee-cake, and Em’ly rushes in and
she says, ‘Maudie,’ she says, ‘George has just
come in. and lie’s got a girl with him.
Straight! I’m not pulling your leg.’ Maudie
says, ‘I don’t believe you,’ and she went
down to take his order.
“We all started dodging down to have a
look, and sure enough there was a girl. Oh
she was a bit o’ style ! She had a new, full
skirt, and one of those little hats, and bits
of hair over her ears, and her lips all red.
and a silver bag. Maudie went up, and if
you’d heard the way this Bit o’ Style talked
to her. ‘Waitress,’ she says, ‘bring me the
menu.’ ‘There’s no menu here,’ says
Maudie. ‘lt's just light refreshments on this
floor.’ ‘Oh deah !’ says the Bit o’ Style, ‘wlmt
a queer place ! Why did you bring me lieah,
George?’ Then she goes off a treat about
everything. The forks were dirty, and the
tea was cold, and the pie was ‘greasay.’ She
talked to Maudie something awful, I call it.
“George looked as if he’d like to crawl
under the table, though it’s my opinion he’d
put her up to it. So, as it just happened
that the boss was out, I got all the girls to
line up at the door when they were going
out—Maudie too. I held on to her apron,
and I says, ‘Just you have a bit o’ spirit.’
We all looks at them like this,” and Miss
Simpson looked down her nose with ineffable
scorn.
“The Bit o’ Style walks out pulling at her
veil and talking to George, and all of a
sudden she looks round and sees us all stand-
ing there, and what do think she did?”
“Tell me!” I said breathlessly,
“She turned round, and she stuck out her
tongue at us! Not a little bit like that”—
anc j Miss Simpson showed a demure red tij
between her teeth. “But all of it, like this’
__ anc ] Miss Simpson hurled her tongue out
0 f her mouth clear down to the root, like a
chameleon catching a fly.
j dropped my knife and fork on the floor,
and groped for them frantically. It seemed
unbearably indelicate to let my gaze linger
on a portion of Miss Simpson’s anatomy
hitherto decently hidden from the light of
(j a y.
“Good gracious!” I faltered. “What a
shock you must have got!”
“Shock? You could have knocked us
down with a stick, as the sayin’ is. We’d
a n thought she was the real thing, but it
just seemed to put Maudie on her feet again,
j didn’t think she had it in her.
u » s h e says, ‘you’ll oblige me by
not herring to George again. A feller that
resorts with persons of that kind is no gentle-
man’”

His Home Coming.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HIS land; the land he knew so well
add loved so much
And learned its secrets as but lovers
may—
There seemed in all its quietness a touch
Of hidden troubling. Xocturned in the grey
Of smothering nightfall on a glad day spent,
The kindred things of earth seemed pained
to say
Fond words of solace to the discontent
That brooded in them. “Would lie come, or
stay,
Now lie is dead,” they asked, “and far
away?”
Was it just now the wind lie loved that
stirred
The leaves to rustling welcome? Was the
change
From blackened skies to jubilance of light
But play of fancy? What I saw and heard
It was not these, but something wondrous
strange....
Tt was his spirit homing'in its flight.
