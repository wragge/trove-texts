Perhaps the most disagreeable of all domestic duties
is washing up, and yet it is one that must be per-
formed three times a day every day in the year.
Someone must do this work in every home, and
whete it falls on the shoulders of the housewife,
it becomes a form of drudgery which makes serious
demands on her already crowded hours.
Why not let Electricity do this work for you ?
The Walker Electric Dish Washer will thoroughly
cleanse, sterilise, rinse arid dry, at one operation
and in from 5 to 10 minutes’ time, the whole of
the dishes and cutlery used during the meal.
This Dish Washer is neat in appearance,
takes up little space, and is a most valu-
able addition to any kitchen.
Lome and see it in operation in our Showrooms.

The Odyssey
Much that was said of the Iliad (R.P.
11/8/”21) holds good 0 f the Odyssey. Pro-
bably neither was written by any one man,
but took its origin from “lays” sung by
tribal bards in the little Greek islands; and
it is quite likely that the singers of the
Odyssey lived before the singers of the Iliad,
or at any rate that the collator of the
Odyssey may • have been long before him of
the Iliad, Lor there is reason to believe that
the Odyssey ,is the more primitive of the two,
and has been less fully "edited.”
It is essentially a song of the sea, written
in a long, tumbling, “lolloping” metre, which
recalls the way of a ship that plunges before
the "Levanter” wind, or the sound of the
waves on a sea-beach ; and possibly the hexa-
meter, born in the islands among people
whose first conscious sounds were those of
the sea, may have originally been an onoma-
topoeic attempt to reproduce in song what
men heard in Nature. % r
Victor Berard, a French naval officer who
wandered all over the Levant in little boats,
thought that most of the difficulties of the
Odyssey disappear if we consider it from the
point of view of sailors in small ships which
have to lie beached and hauled up at night;
and that in reality it was founded on
Phoenician metrical guides to the Eastern
Mediterranean.- Their modern counterpart
would be that most un-llomeric doggerel
which runs:—
If both sidelights you see ahead
Port your helm and show your red;
and the rest of that mnemonic. In this
belief Berard lias identified the locality of
many of the striking scenes in the Odyssey,
even to the very* spring at which Nausicaa
washed her clothes, to the great embarrass-
ment of "many-wiled Odysseus,” who hap-
pened to have been cast ashore naked at that
place. Now comes Mr., Francis Chul-
ieild, who, greatly daring, and fortified by a
preface from the headmaster of liugby, has
dime it into English hexameters ( 'Homer's
’Odyssey; Bell, London).
? 'The hexameter of Ilomer consisted of six
feet, either dactyls or spondees, of which the
fifth foot had to be a dactyl and the last a
spondee; somewhere in the middle came a
pause—the caesura. By .slightly varying
the position of his pause and the proportions
of dactyls to spondees, Homer secured the
characteristic rise and fall of the hexameter
which made such surging music. The typical
English hexameter runs “Down in a deep dark
dell sat an old cow chewing a turnip” ; but
many poets have tried to write hexameters
seriously, only to fail on the horrible bump
that generally comes at the very last syl-
lable, as "-ip” in the line instanced, which
is very different from the "ehreidn Agamem-
non” of Homer. Coleridge, in a joking letr
ter, written to the Wordsworths in hexa-
meters, at once found the source of the
difficulty. There are plenty of good dactyls
in English, but very few good spondees;
and so his Pegasus would not rise and fall
smoothly, but would only “hop or gallop,”
and his rider could not pull him up when
lie wished. The restless and insatiable
thunder which is so impressive in Homer be-
comes intolerable in English; you get no
peace: even a full-stop will not check Pega-
sus, for he runs wild. The great “owns”
and "ays” which lent such music to Greek
are almost absent from English.
Coleridge could write a single exquisite line
such as "In the hexameter rises the foun-
tain’s.. silvery column,” which sounds almost
worthy of Homer; but when he came to
write “The Ancient Mariner,” which, if the
Odyssey had never existed, would have been
incomparably the greatest sea-song in the
world, he chose the simplest of metres, the
simplest of language. Listen -
The body of my brother’s son
Stood by me, loiee to knee :
The body and 1 pulled at one rope
But he said nought to me.
Could anything be more childishly simple, or
more absolutely horrible ? To me the horror
lies in the deliberate use of the Word “body,”
when a lesser man could have said “spectre.”
A dead body pulling at a rope with you—
ugh !
Some of Caulfeiid's Odyssey is almost in-
conceivably bald. Let him sing:—
For you may take ray word, no life is so bad as a
sailor’s
Quickly to break a man up, however sturdy he
may be.'
And again:—
tor from my hardships at sea I am shockingly out
of condition,
Since ori board of a ship from one year's end to
another
There is ho'chance of training-; and so my legs are
eiifeebledi '
Thus sings Caulfeild ; thus assuredly did -not-'
sing Homer; I protest Caulfeiid’s version to
be a libel. Yet, frightful though these verses
may sound, they are not without a horrific
attraction, for in them an old sea-dog sings
from his salt-encased heart. All sailors wish
to leave seafaring and watch things grow on
farms, and you will sometimes see deserters
from ships wandering with tongues hanging-
out and hoping that some farmer will employ
them. One wonders whether Caulfeiid’s
prosaic diction is of set purpose, or comes
because he is a less great poet than Homer,
struggling with an impossible metre. Ilis
idea of doing the Odyssey into colloquial lan-
guage such as might have been used by the
old tarry-breeks who doubtless often sang it
is not without merit, and one greets it with
the kindly smile which one reserves for the
enthusiast, even though one may not approve
of his doings.
Was it not Tennyson who sang disgustedly
of English hexameters: “These lamp hexa-
meters the strong-winged music of Homer”?
Where Longfellow and Coleridge have failed
it is unlikely that another will succeed. Yet
it is only fair to say that at least one Eng-
lish critic considers Caulfeiid’s one of the
best attempts; and not even metrical failure
can quite remove the delicious tang of the
wa and salt winds that pervades the Odyssev.
Rather than translate it into doggerel it is
hotter to follow Botcher and Lang, and try
the prose of the Bible.
C. M. L.
Cubes, Critics and Tyros
In the modern art-world the younger
painters are divided into a number of war-
ring sects—Post-Impressionists. Expression-
ists, Futurists, Cubists, Vorticists and all
the rest of them—who are in fierce conflict
not only on fundamental points of doctrine,
but on the minutest differences in method
and technique. An Anglo-Franco-Belgian
group, called the “Monarro” (after Monet
and Pissarro, both of whom are represented
in the Melbourne National Gallery), held its
first exhibition in London at the Goupil
Gallery. Its aim was “to concentrate the
work of the artists who have derived inspira-
tion more or less directly from the leaders
of the French Impressionist movement,
Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro.” This
was an interesting exhibition, though
its connection with the original Im-
pressionists was of the slightest. The
work of Paul Signac, however, was
a deliberate and scientific attempt to
carry Monet’s "pointillism,’ or division
of tones, to the furthest point possible. A
Signac picture became a mosaic of square
touches, brilliant, often dazzling in colon:
but the mechanism of his technique tended
to become monotonous. Curiously enough
Pissarro’s three sons, all painters of merit,
seetned to owe little to the influence of their
father; they belonged rather to the school
that regards Cezanne as the master and
pioneer of modern art.
Another group of Post-Impressionists de-
voted all their attention to problems .of
color; on Monet’s principle that light is
the subject of every picture. Its aim was
to appeal to the emotions and imagination
through color as music does through sound
without thought of any relationship to exter-
nal nature. Their art became subjective,
never objective, sometimes charming enough,
but generally too vague. When the inevit-
able reaction set in, form came to be studied
more seriously. And from the study and
analysis of form, it is maintained, arose
that extraordinary phenomenon called
Cubism.
Pablo Picasso, a Basque by origin but a
Parisian student, is generally regarded as
the founder of Cubism. His first London
exhibition was held recently in the Leicester
Galleries. His early pictures, which show
the influence of Steinlen and Fora in, and
were quite orthodox and not remarkable in
any way, were exhibited with his later Cub-
ist work, which formed a startling contrast
to them. It was a baffling exhibition for the
critics. “What- is Cubism V” they asked, like
jesting Pilate, and the answers to their
questions were usually contradictory. It
was stated that Cubism was a scientifk
movement, founded on mathematics, the
theory being that all form was ultimately
based on the cube and the sphere. Other
critics maintained that it was psychological
an intellectual movement, primarily con
corned not with"'nature but with abstract
ideas. Clive Bell claimed Picasso as the
paramount figure in modern painting. “Al
the world over,” lie wrote, “are students and
young painters to whom his name is thrill-
ing ; to whom Picasso is the liberator,”
Whatever the theory may be, the canvases
were difficult to understand. A characteristic
work was "La Dame au Fauteuil,” 1014. In
this picture there was no lady, no recognis-
able part of one, and no armchair —nothing
except a jumble of mathematical figures
planes, triangles, cones; cubes that may
or may not have suggested a lady sitting in
an armchair. It was certainly not a "re-
presentation,” a portrait; but Roger Fin
assured us: "The appeal of a work of art
is a question of linear rhythm, of the rela-
tion of planes and masses and colors —resem-
blance to nature may be dismissed as a test.”
The Greeks thought the graphic arts were
based on "imitation” ; but it seems they were
mistaken. According to Clive Bell, Picasso
is one of the most inventive minds in Eurone.
"A highly original and happy conception
enters his head, suggested, probably, by some
odd thing lie has seen. lie proceeds by ex-
periment, applying his hypothesis in the
most unlikely places. The significant ele-
ments of negro sculpture are found to repeat
their success in the drawing of a lemon.”
One of Picasso’s latest studies of still life
was called “Nature Morte: Verre et Pipe,”
11)11). It was just possible, in this extra-
ordinary composition, oh, strictly speaking,
decomposition, to recognise parts of a
glass or a pipe (a little bit of the bowl, per-
haps, or a section of the mouthpiece) and a
fragment of tobafcco (it may have been a
lemon), though, as it happened, the tobacco
was 'isolated from the pipe and mixed up
somehow with a bit of glass, all the signifi-
cant elements (they may have been derived
from negro sculpture) being arranged in
colored cubes and triangles at the highly
original and happy caprice of the painter.
Picasso created another sensation with his
scenery and costumes for “The Three-
Cornered Hat,” which was first produced in
London by the Russian Balled. Against the
glaringly white background of an Andalusian
landscape the peasant costumes of the
wildest, most bizarre colors and designs stood
out in the most startling manner. But the
ensemble was effective, in the spirit of the
music and the ballet.
After Picasso’s experiments, the attempts
to shock the public bv the younger English
Futurists, such as the London group, or
the “X” group, became flat and tame. It
was Walter Sickert, a true disciple of Degas
and Whistler, a great wit as well as a
great painter, and the most formidable oopo-
nent of the Royal Academy, who said to
some young students, at one of these futile
exhibitions: “Let us march in procession
down Piccadilly to Burlington House, and
shout ‘Vive I’oynter !’ ”
But the latest exhibition of Wyndham
Lewis, the leading exponent of Vortieism.
broke new ground. Lewis contended that
the need of modern art was satire, that an-
other Hogarth was necessary to clear the
air. He invented a new type, which he

Why American
flashlights are best
THEIR non-short-circuiting construc-
tion prevents wasting of the battery
current.
There are no movable parts within the
case to cause damage or breakage.
They all are equipped with exclusive
shock absorber to protect lamp against
breakage from dropping or rough usage.
The dual contact permits either a flash
or a continuous light, each independent
of the other.
American Flashlight Batteries, too, are
best. They last longer and give a brighter
light. Always insist upon “American.”

October Trees.
The pine is set over with white little tapers
As if for a feast. .
From her hair has the willow ta’en out the
curl-papers,
And crinkled and creased
Fall the long shining tresses adown to the
ground.
The cedar is crowned
With her ancient mantilla of delicate lace,
And the sapling—the sapling has rouge on.
her face!
While slender and gay
With flounces a-sway,*
The plane-tree dances, foul weather and fine,
Like a green columbine.

The Music.
When I am sick at heart and bodily sick,
When leaden skies glower on my discon-
tent, •
So that at last my pride and spirit are
bent
In deep perplexity, then, Ariel-quick,
A strain of music flashes lunatic
From nowhere into nothing, a strain soon
spent,
But, in its strength eternal, impotent
Am I to resist its magic. Stone and brick
And sooted timbered edifice glow serene
And splendid in that music. Hate and
shame
Lose all their poison. Nothing I can see
Is longer sordid, trivial, harsh of mean. .. .
For that dear music (lady I may not
name)
Is but a thought of your thoughts that
are kind to me.

Love’s Lord.
’Neath sun and moon
No realm is vaster
Than that reigned over and ruled by Love.;
For 10, and behold,
With lordship pleasant,
Is he not master
Of brave and bold,
Of nrinee and peasant,
And hawk and dove?
’Neath sun and moon
His breath is sweeter
Than warm winds sweetened by flower and
fruit; . . .. ■ ...
And under his sway,
With glad chimes ringing,
The blood runs fleeter,
As, night and day,
He sets hearts singing
That else were mute.
’Neath sun and moon
Love has no master,
Save one who wanders with chilling breath ;
For. 10, and behold,
Though Love be present,
No bolts fall faster
On brave and bold
And prince and peasant
Than those of Death.

RODERIC QUINN.
The Gods Live Still.
Among the trees grey shadows haunt the
way,
While through the opal light soft splendors
spill,
And, ail expectant of the coming day,
Blossom and bird and beast and man are
still;
Surely I know, as one in transport may,
That the old gods the mystic wild-woods
fill.
Aurora’s tears the cup-like leaflets fill,
For her half-mortal son she weeps alway;
On drenched grasses how they glitter still,
Bright as when first upon that fatal day
Brave Memnon fought, his gallant blood to
spill,
Leaving her sad, as but a lost son may.
I wander, quiet as all, for then I may
Hear Proserpine’s lament the forest fill;
Find her plucked lilies on the mossy way;
Meet Geres, seeking o’er the wide world
still
Her ravished daughter, resting night nor day,
While from her robes ambrosial perfumes
spill.
Will Psyche from the misty cliff-top spill
Her form, more lovely than the flowering
may
That Zepher’s arms receive? Soft whispers
fill"
The vocal grove, and down the golden way
Will Cupid come, his wings a-drooping still
And eyelids heavy, at the break of day?
Pan pipes an invocation to the day ;
He never dies while gushing fountains
.spill,
And Naiads play and Dryads point the way.
While song and dance the woods and
valleys fill,
And music such as ne’er a mortal may
Blow from a reed is heard by lovers still.
Green bark encloses virgin Daphne, still
Embraced by bright Apollo, who, as. day,
Sheds his hot beams, and gold and jewels
spill
On her he loves as some great conqueror
may.
And vain regrets the breathing branches fill
And sorrowing leaves that e’er she ran'
away.
In twilit sway the gods are living still;
Romance can spill by night the dreams of
day,
And, doubt who may, the heart with fra-
grance fill.

THE WAR THAT WILE FOLLOW
DISARMAMENT.
The great natioi.r of the world have been
divided by the war into capitalists and mem-
bers of the proletariat, with U.S.A. as the
Rockefeller of the moneyed group and Japan
a striving nouveau riche. It was natural
that proposals for a limitation of naval
armaments should have come from the
nation which has all the territory it wants
and is beginning to be harassed by the in-
evitable obligations of wealth —in its case,
chiefly, the necessity of paying extravagant
wages commensurable with tiie high prices
following on the possession of most of the
world’s gold. But it was not so superficially
obvious why Japan should be eager to see
the scheme succeed. To that nation, however,
the conditions are of supreme importance. If
it can acquire cei’tain trading rights in
China —notably a share with China in the
Iviao-Chau and Esi-nan-fu railway, with the
coal and iron mines along the route —and if
it can retain control of Korea, Japan is safe
economically for the next hundred years.
Safe, but by no means satisfied. The
Japanese would not be the, brave, proud
and intelligent people they have shown
themselves if they were content to be halted
half-way up the ladder of nower and fame
without a struggle. “Peace,” observed
Treitsciike, “is veiled warfare.” _ Naval
•disarmament, if it is achieved on a big scale,
will give the winning Powers, harassed by
the demands of those who fought for a new
earth,-a breathing-space in which to improve
their housing, hospital, sanitary and child-
welfare systems and generally render the lot
of the mutinous poor more bearable. But
it will not be used in that way by the
climbers —by the nations which have a defi-
nite position to reach or recover before they
can afford to begin thinking about liumani-
tarianism.
An indication of what may be expected
can be got from a glance at conditions in
Germany. A Sydney business man who
returned from there last week told the Sun:
It is lamentable to learn of large and important
orders in the iron and-steel trades executed in Ger-
many for purely British requirements; It is common
knowledge that refitting and reconditioning of Bri-
tish ships is being largely done in German ports. The
British yards are not only unable to give fixed prices
for work, but also to fix a time for completion.
Germany’s pull, industrially, is a matter of
having lost the war. There is no beastly
pride about the Hun worker just now. lie
is not- striking.* He is taking any ' Wages
he can get. It is not altogether the docility
of. desperation either: it would be better
for the. easy-going races if it were. The idea
is to rehabilitate .. the Fatherland ; to win in
the workshops the war that was lost by" the
blockade. The organisation —Wiederaufbau
—which is at the back of this enterprise, is
national and it includes all classes, though
it was initiated by ex-officer workers, and
though it naturally includes an enormous
proportion of former fighting-men.. It is the
still-militant German’s reply to' France’s in-
sistence on his country’s naval and military
disarmament; and its danger to' France is
evident in view of the fact that that country,
at latest advices, had about three-quarters
of a million men under arms, in addition to
a number of still-ailing if not crippled in-
dustries in the North, and a restless prole-
tariat.
It was often said during the Great ■ War
that if Germany had waited another 10
years it would not have needed to fight :
its chief enemies might have been destroyed
in the bloodless fields of commerce. How
infinitely more dangerous the position; is
to-day! Freed of the necessity" of serving
in an army or navy, the Germans are able
to devote their whole energies to production.
Their former enemies may take their indem-
nity-payments either in manufactured goods
and see their own industries ruined, or in
some other form, such as cash or raw
materials earned in Russia and China, and
see the Germans build up markets from
which it will oe impossible to oust them.
It is not remarkable, then, that the victori-
ous nations, having nearly ruined themselves
getting into a position to disarm their late
enemies, -are now voluntarily disarming
themselves, to an extent, in order to avoid
complete ruin. Yet they still remain under
a twofold handicap ; Powers in the position
of Britain or France cannot utterly disarm
on land, and no power with colonies can
disarm completely on the sea. In Cobden’s
day Britain decided on fiscal disarmament
on much the same lines as those under dis-
cussion at Washington. Things went
auspiciously for a while —as they are cer-
tain to do for several years with Britain
saving a capital outlay of £9,000,000 and
the continued services of 1500 men each
time it foregoes a battle-cruiser. But no
conference or other gathering can extinguish
mankind’s ambition to excel. Even if the
whole world puts away the sword there will
still be a reckoning ahead—a reckoning be-
tween the easy-going haves and the frugal,
hard-working have-nots.
The position may not therefore be tremen-
dously improved—indeed, it may actually be
worsened —for Australia or any other coun-
try where the gospel of leisure is becoming
increasingly nopular. In the days of the
unchallengeable superiority of the R.N., wo
were defended practically free of charge; and
even if the Commonwealth had not decided
for a navy, the British Government would
no doubt have gone on protecting our White
Australia policy, our high wages and, our
advanced living and industrial standards —
so long, at any rate, as old conditions lasted.
But that era ended in a sense with the
ending of the war, which found the United
Kingdom up to its eyes in debt, largely
foreign. And it will * end * completely once
disarmament becomes an accomplished fact.
In the world-strife which must’then develop,
the weapons will not be, as in the past, huge
masses of iron and steel, but the will to
live economically' and work hard. Austra-
lians have many industrial advantages over
their Asiatic and other competitors. They
enjoy the best climate in the world,-and a
land teeming with wealth; and they will
start their economic conflict with a magnifi-
cent general standard of education and
physique. But if they are not prepared to
regard steady toil as a form of patriotism, as
the Germans are already doing, and as the
Japs undoubtedly will do the moment the
national issues at stake are brought home
to them, then-the Coinmonwealth is going
to have a very poor future. The eventual
price of go-slow and the 44-hour week may
eveh be servitude.
TAMMANY FACING THE MUSIC.
Unless the Dooley Government can pre-
vent it at the eleventh hour, the 13 Labor
aldermen who have made Sydney a paradise
for corporation laborers, Tammany wire-
pullers, illicit bookmakers, .lottery-agents,
owners of gaming implements, backstairs
contractors and pacifists will go before their
constituents next week. It is a consumma-
tion they have striven to avert by every
means in their power, and there is still a
desperate hope tliat'Dooley will save them
somehow. Considering the boasts of one of
these worthies that their regime is “as near
perfection as possible,” their anxiety to
avoid meeting the ratepayers who have pro-
vided the money for, and presumably benefited
by, this beatific administration is extraor-
dinary. In the beginning it took the form
of trying to get thousands of them struck
off the roll by all sorts of frivolous objec-
tions. When this device failed, with heavy
costs, an effort was made to swamp the
city ratepayers’ vote by hastily anhexing the
predominantly Labor municipality of Pad-
dington. That plot was frustrated by a
spirited revolt of three Paddington Labor
aldermen against the machine. The Gov-
ernment thereupon introduced the Sydney
Corporation Amendment Bill, and shoved
it through the Assembly by means of the
gag. The object of this putrid measure was
to disfranchise property-owners, business
and professional men, shophands, office-
workers—in a word, all those who get their
living within the city boundaries but sleep
beyond thenr—-and leave the destinies of
Sydney to be decided by corporation laborers,
caretakers, club stewards, Pintpot, Sissy
the barmaid, and lodgers of a month’s stand-
ing. It was a scheme w-orthy of the Tam-
many cabal that concocted it and the de-
graded Government that tried to embody it
in an Act. But its ruin was inevitable from
the moment the Leg. Council plucked up
courage enough to reject the Wheat Market-
ing Bill. So, unless Dooley comes to light
at the last moment with an Act to continue
the present aldermen in their offices until
non-Labor ratepayers have been got rid of
and secures the immediate appointment of
30 or 40 more Labor Leg. Councillors, Bill
Lambert and his, reluctant followers will,
have to face the music. Which means that
they will' be judged by an unpacked Bench
on their- record- do ring—the "past - three ■ yea rs.
A remarkable record it is. In the muni-
cipal history of the Commonwealth there is
nothing quite like it. Never before has a
big Australian city been captured by ward
politicians of the Tammany sort and sys-
tematically exploited in the interests of a
class. Never before has Australia witnessed
so close an approximation to the system of
municipal politics that in New York pro-
duced a Boss Tweed, and in San Francisco
a Rite and a Schmidt. Between the Tam-
many method of city government and that of
the Sydney A.L.P. there is merely the dif-
ference of a. name. Questions of taxation,
the distribution of revenues amounting to
three-quarters of a million per annum and
the allocation of contracts which ma ,r exceed
that figure are decided upon by a clique of
ward bosses sitting behind closed doors.
Among other things, this clique has used
its control of the money power to purchase
the support of the municipal employees, fo
whom have been conceded, not only large
increases of wages, but Saturdays off, three
weeks’ holiday per year and all public holi-
days, long service leave, full pay when they
are sick (or say they are) and other costly
gifts. And in order that this privileged
class may signify its gratitude in the usual
manner it has received, for exchange into
currency to be expended on or on behalf of
its benefactors, a large parcel of worthless
“A.L.P. bonds.” In short, the clique bleeds
the ratepayers to coddle the municipal em-
ployees and levies tribute on them to pay
its election expenses. In a city run on
these lines anything might be expected to
happen. And although the Sydney aider-
man resembles the modest violet in his dis-
taste for publicity, several notable incidents
have burst into prominence. There was the
proposal to pay £75,000 for an alleged coal-
mine valued by experts at £5OOO. There
was the hotel bought for street-widening
purposes for which £20,000 was paid, and
which changed hands again and again with
exceeding profit to good Mr. Ticklebrain,
although all the Council got out of it was
£62 a year. There was the plan to give a
firm of architects £40,000 (it was to have
been a lot more at the start) for a job that
the city surveyor was quite competent and
willing to do for his ordinary salary. This
transaction, if Cecil Last is to be believed,
was what prompted the A.L.P. Executive,
a body quite foreign to the Sydnev rate-
payers, to select the Lord Mayor itself in-
instead of letting the aldermen do it. Said
Last, himself a member of the Executive,
at the March A.L.P. Conference: —
You want to know why we took in hand the mat-
ter of electing the Lord Mayor. Well, I’ll tell you.
The Moore-street extension scheme was on. There
was to be a little commission of £lOO,OOO. But
that seemed too much, so it was reduced to
£40,000. Wasn’t it time that the Executive stepped
in to take a hand in the business when that kind
of thing was going on?
Last’s unusual outburst was recorded in
the 1 official report of the Conference. But
that didn’t prevent the Worker, seven
months later, from expressing its pained
astonishment at the charge against Aider-
man Bramston and suggesting that all the
“veiled accusations of bribery and corrup-
tion levelled at the Municipal Labor party,”
the “dirty hints, sneers and filthy insinua-
tions,” came “from the other side.”

Satan has found apologists, and there
must be people who believe in Tammany
rule, otherwise it wouldn’t exist. But it
would task the inventive powers of the
most enthusiastic Labor champion to say
anything in favor of the inept gang that
for three years has had Sydney in its grip.
It has raised the rates until;they are nearly
double’ those ruling in Melbourne, but the
only tangible result is a; deficit which has
become chronic. It has allowed the road-
ways and footpaths to get into a condition
of disrepair that would shame a backblocks
town. In this department and in the street-
deansiiig branch there has been a prodigious
increase in expenditure, but it. is a common
complaint that the city arteries were never
filthier or more dilapidated than they have
been for the past two years. By a sinister
coincidence, there has been a sharp rise in
the infantile death-rate owing to the preva-
lence of dirt diseases ; in Sydney and suburbs
last year 74.2 babies died of every 1000 born,
whereas the mortality on the North Coast
was only 45.9 per 1000. But the North
Coast doesn’t go in for the Saturday loaf.
For two •' winters, moreover, Sydney has
shivered in its shops and offices be-
cause the municipal lighting depart-
ment 1 had no current to spare for
heating. That same lighting department is
the most ruinous futility of its kind in Aus-
tralia. It was recently reduced to apply-
ing for permission to exact more plunder
from the public, although on precisely the
same scale of charges the Balmain Electric
Light Co. contrived to pay 8 per cent, divi-
dends, and this after defraying heavy rates
and taxes from which the Sydney Council s
decrepit undertaking is exempt. The Labor
majority has distinguished itself in another
sphere by its sullen hostility to returned
soldiers. Wherever the Town Clerk has
had the ordering of things the Soldiers
Preference Act has been scrupulously
respected, but iu other cases the law
has been set at defiance in the .in-
terests of non-warriors. In the same
spirit Labor aldermen give a civic reception
to Dr. Mannix, but of the mere Australian
Monash, who visits Sydney from time to
time, they don’t seem to have heard. Bar-
ring accidents and Dooley, the opportunity
of dealing with those ill-informed gentlemen
will come to Sydney on December 1. It is
improbable, on the face of it, that Sydney
will send them back to the • unpaid jobs
which are so eagerly sought after, but it
Sydney does it will deserve all it gets.
BRIBERY, CORRUPTION AND COLD
TEA.
The first big Prohibition drive that Aus-
tralia has known started in Sydney this
week, the object being to make N. S. Wales
bone-dry. Yankee methods are to be em-
ployed throughout—which is understandable,
seeing that most of those who are toiling to
save the Ma State from herself come from
the U.S.A., where they have depended for a
living for years past on exploiting the fran-
chise to overthrow boxing, horseracing,
drink and so forth. One Thos. E. Shonk
has revealed the plan of campaign with a
frankness that in a Fiji uncle would be
termed cynical :
The N. S. Wales Alliance aims to get 100,000
electors to sign this pledge:—
1 promise that 1 will not give my first prefer-
ence vote to any candidate for Parliament who is not
pledged to support the democratic principle of an
immediate referendum on prohibition, to be decided
by a bare majority.
A review of the voting- at the last election showed
that, in at least four electorates, the lowest unsuc-
cessful candidate was fewer than 100 votes behind
.the lowest successful candidate, and in no fewer than
11 electorates the highest unsuccessful candidate
was fewer than 1000 votes behind. With the
Alliance holding even 1000 pledges in these elec-
torates, the members will be forced to promise a
referendum, or face the serious risk of losing their
seats.
There is no question here of political or any
other principle. It is the rankest form of
Tammanyism applied to a cause which has
the effrontery to masquerade in the gar-
ments of the higher morality. The candi-
date who has seen enough of liquor-prohibi-
tion to appreciate that it is about as prac-
ticable as sex-prohibition, and who has the
honesty to say so, is to be opposed; the
fraud who would pledge himself to support
any imposture rather than “face the serious
risk of losing his seat” will get the votes of
the very people who talk loudest of the
necessity of purifying Parliament. No end
justifies a means such as this, whose effects
must be to gradually poison the Legislature.
If the ethical aspect is put on one side —
if it is accepted tliat considerations of poli-
tical decency do not enter into the prohibi-
tion fight, and that factors such as the .pros-
titution of an elective Chamber are negli-
gible—then it may be admitted that this old
Yankee dodge is likely to be very effective in
Australia. But it is likely to be also unusu-
ally calamitous. Sydney contains 42.82 p.c.
of the total population of N. S. Wales, as
against London's 9.61 p.c. of England’s, Dub-
lin’s 9.18 p.c. of Ireland’s, Edinburgh’s 6.96
p.c. of Scotland’s. Now, cities are notoriously
anti-prohibition, however strongly they may
be in favor of liquor-reform. If they are
made dry it is usually done by the votes
of those who are ouite ready to damn the
sins they’re not inclined to; who either have
no desire to drink, or are in a position to
get all the drink they want without using a
city hotel for the purpose. Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Dela-
ware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Mary-
land, Illinois, Ohio, Missouri and Cali-
fornia, with the district of Columbia, contain
between them 45,000,000 people, or nearly
half the inhabitants of the U.S.A. The
population of these States is 68 p.c. urban
and the great majority in all of them are
opposed to prohibition and are occupied
daily and nightly in defying it. The thing
was imposed on them from the outside —
firstly by a two-thirds vote of Congress
secured on the lines that are now being used
in N. S. Wales by the Alliance’s mostly-
imported organisers; and later by a stam-
pede of the States which.'were induced to
believe that the success of prohibition had
some connection with patriotism and the
winning of the war. If the politicians of
N. S. Wales are anything like as unscrupu-
lous as the Alliance alleges, the necessary
Parliamentary majority for an immediate
referendum —the majority; not the two-thirds
vote requisite in the U.S. Legislature—is a
certainty. Mr. Siionk boasts that 45 have
already come to heel; “others have compro-
mised in their answers, whilst some are re-
ported to state that they are for a referen-
dum, but do not want their names pub-
lished.” And in a State referendum a bare
majority in favor of prohibition should be
fairly easy to secure. The votes of most
of those who do not use hotels —of the
women especially —are to be relied on. There
is a large A.L.P. vote which looks on pro-
hibition as a means of exasperating the
workers against State control and so in-
clining them' towards revolution. And a
-proportion of the “silent vote” will be got,
as it was in the U.S.A., by methods of
bribery and blackmail analogous to those
used in the case of the politicians. The
svstem is for local organisers to get pledges
from sections undertaking not to have busi-
ness relations with those who openly oppose
prohibition, and when the attention of the
smaller commercial or professional men is
drawn to these documents they usually re-
act to them in the manner desired.
* * * *
Assume, then, that, as a result of such
devices, N. S. Wales is saddled with the
innovation which is now making the U.S.A.
a nation of law-breakers. In the first place,
just as it has a larger proportion of city-
dwellers than any American State, so it will
have a larger minority resentfully deter-
mined to continue a habit which Jesus
Christ did not consider a sin, and which
the law of England has never regarded as a
crime. Next, it is generally estimated that


THE HUNDRED BEST.
The CHRISTMAS BULLETIN —a
special number—to be published
on Saturday, December 10, will
include work by the hundred best
artists and writers of Australia.
It is to be sold at the same price as
an ordinary number—ninepence.
SATURDAY, DECEMBER 10.
at least £12,000,000 will be required to com-
pensate the trade. Those who argue against
compensating the dispossessed on the giound
tli&t their trade never should have been
allowed to exist must face the fact that,
during all the years it did exist, they shared
in the benefits accruing from the sums it
paid in taxation. To be consistent they
should, therefore, pay back to the State on
a pro rata basis their share of all such
alleged ivages of sin. And even then it is
questionable if they will have engineered
themselves into a position to contend that
a business, great or small, may safely, much
less equitably, be ruined by a bare majority
vote. In this case it is not only a few rich
brewers, hotel-proprietors and vignerons
who are going to suffer, but their employees
to the number of about 30,000; scores of
trades which are dependent wholly or in
part on the liquor business ; and many small
men, most of them ex-Diggers, who
have taken up wine-grape growing. This
fresh army of unemployed will be thrown
on the Government’s hands at the same time
as it is required (if it does not feel disposed
to emulate the commercial methods of early
Bolshevism) to go to London for an enor-
mous sum of money. But so little does the
U.K. think of prohibition that practically
all the pre-war drink regulations are in
operation there once more, including that
one giving approved restaurants, etc., the
right to supply alcohol up to midnight. The
only alternative to a highly-probable Thread-
needle-street rebuff is to raise the
£12,000,000 in America at American rates
of interest. The U.S.A. went dry with, at
any rate, a certain appearance of unanimity
born of war neurosis. Yet to-day, according
to Samuel H. Adams, a life-long temper-
ance enthusiast:—
As a nation, if the newspapers correctly reflect
what most interests us, we sit in rapt contempla-
tion of ourselves in the act of discrediting a law
which we enacted only after the maturest and most
careful consideration; and if many of us greet the
anomalous performance with hisses, many others
contribute laughter and applause.
If America, which began with a relatively
small minority hostile to prohibition, and
which was in a Constitutional position to
improve the policy on a continent-wide basis,
finds after a couple of years that the law
can be safely flouted to the accompaniment
of popular applause, what is the situation
likely to be in an Australian State which
is certain to have about 50 per cent, of the
residents hostile to the new liquor order,
and is bounded north and south by terri-
tories which are unlikely to follow its ex-
ample, to make no mention of the trackless
ocean which washes its seaboard? If the
N. S. Wales Alliance and its Yankee mer-
cenaries have no satisfactory answer to this
conundrum they stand condemned as adven-
turers who, for the sake of money and lime-
light, are prepared to ruin Australian citi-
zens wholesale and saddle the State with
further debt in the interests of an illusion
as transparent as Communism.
DISARMAMENT IN CIVIL LIFE.
The State is robbing man of all means of
self-defence under a’ pretext of making them
all quite unnecessary. The rapier has been de-
posed in favor of the policeman’s truncheon
on an assumption that the truncheon be-
stows a security the rapier could never give.
Even the use of the clenched hand is denied
us; we are offered instead access to a blue
form with the privilege of haling an offen-
der or an assailant before a bench of magis-
trates at the expense of much time and
trouble, probably a greater aggravation than
the original affront. This legal recourse,
however, provides no guarantee of a remedy
or a recompense.
A man must not carry a pistol these days
for fear of his.injuring some person or per-
sons who have set themselves the task of
doing him moral and material harm, either
for gain or with malice aforethought. A
sword-stick being a lethal weapon, its use
is rigidly restricted, and if a man carry a
truncheon to strengthen a weak leg he
must not use it to crack a wicked head,
though he be sorely beset and receive open
insult or hear his womenkind miscalled by
some truculent ruffian of the kerb. We are
turned defenceless from our homes, and left
open to a thousand forms of misuse, most
of us still cherishing the delusion that from
all mischief, bad conduct and ill-dealing the
State, through the instrumentality of the
law, offers full and adequate protection ; yet
no man, particularly if he be a small man
and not favored with defensive coloration
and the ominous brow of a bulldog, can
use our streets without meeting and endur-
ing some instance of transgression of good
manners, or a deliberate insult, for which he
can seek no refuge under the law without
laying himself wide open to derision.
In the days of the swordsmen a small citi-
zen might prove himself as ready a man
as his cumbersome neighbor, and possibly
more capable of enforcing his point in an
argument; but in these days of untold, all-
embracing laws and patriarchal Governments,
the fellow whose physique does not suggest that
he could give an offender an uncomfortable
10 minutes in a rough-up may be exposed
for any length of time to the ribaldry of a
set of young rascals in a railway-carriage,
knowing perfectly well that the law will
not help him, after rigidly denying him the
right to help himself. He may try the law
(that is every free man’s privilege) at his
own expense and a cost of much weariness
of spirit, but in 99 instances out of 100
with no satisfaction to his aggrieved spirit
and no healing of his hurt places.
The ordinary nine-stone man’s experience
at the racecourse, the football ground and
in the theatre are equally unfortunate, and
if he have his young wife.at his elbow lie
is likely to have 10 times more reason to
long for the return of the day
when an agile Lilliputian might pierce
the hide of an insolent Blatherskite
Blunperbore. Nor does the house-
father need to go abroad to meet with mani-
festations of the inefficacy of the disarma-
ment law which, having stripped him, bids
him fear no foe, and then turns its back
on him, while he deals as best he can empty-
handed with the burly ruffian who calls at
his door, and, standing on his own mat,
roundly attacks him if he will not buy rub-
bish or give in charity to the least worthy
of his kind. Unless he knows his actual
existence to be endangered, the house-dweller
must not draw a lethal weapon on the
marauder whom he finds collecting his most
valued household gods, from crumbled bureau
and shattered sideboard, the assumption
being always that the law is ever-present to
see justice done, and no man may take into
his own profane hands its administration.
Yet it is true that only in very rare in-
stances is the law capable of dealing with
the house-breaker, the penalties of the law
being mostly for the law-abiding. All about
my home in a suburban avenue, where the
heavy foot of the constable is responsible
for but very little of the wear of the path-
way, houses have been pillaged of late, in
some instances twice over, and now and then
rightful owners, coming unaware upon the
robbers in the act, have suffered the addi-
tional inconvenience and ignominy of being
compelled to stare into the muzzle of a
venomous-looking automatic pistol. In no
case has the law which disarmed these tax-
payers succeeded in overtaking the criminal
or in offering the victim the smallest recom-
pense or satisfaction.
Out of this condition of things has sprung
the system of burglary assurance now so
popular. The man who has thus bought
guarantees ceases to have any concern for the
police or to worry his head with regard to
the failure of the law. Returning to his
home after “the pictures” and finding the
burglar in possession, he steps back with
a deferential bow. “I beg your pardon. My
mistake,” he says. “This is a burglary, I
presume? Very well, proceed. I am in-
sured up to the hilt, and since you are not
robbing me (although these goods are dc
facto mine) there is no occasion for any
warmth of feeling between v us. After you,
gentlemen!” But I would like to see how
a system might be evolved that would pro-
vide recompense to simple, non-pugnacious
people for the thousand and one insults and
injuries they receive at the hands (and
tongues) of the uncouth in their ordinary
peregrinations. An assurance society for
extending consolation for injured feelings,
black eyes and minor atrocities may be pos-
sible ; I leave it to experts to discover the
ways and means. I perceive no hope of
restitution and reimbursement for the many
other ills that the lightweight man endures
at the inspiration of those whose contempt
for the law is equalled by their disdain of
decency, good manners and all the amenities
of social order. It is a curious anomaly,
but in civilisation the law has developed
largely into an institution for the protection
of blackguards, and the plain man who goes
to law to put down one enemy may well
tremble lest he raise up seven.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
“Credits.”
The Labor half of the conference which sat.
round-table fashion, in Sydney to consider
unemployment voted as one man for ex-
parson Garden’s proposition that “credits
should be opened” to allow of hours being
shortened, profit abolished and wages raised
“to a point where they equal the price of
the produce.” leaving nothing for the people
who invent and organise ways of producing
the produce. “Opening credits” means in
this case, of course, issuing paper of some
sort without any of the old-fashioned secu-
rity behind it. With the old-fashioned secu-
rity credits open themselves to almost any
extent at any hour of the day and sometimes
at night also. The German republic has
lately been opening credits on the new pat-
tern-opening credits by the issue on a large
scale of notes with no gold reserve, but other-
wise “secured on the whole public and
private wealth of the country.” - And
what has happened? In the days be-
fore “credits were opened” about 20 marks
equalled £1; subsequently, in the beat of the
excitement, they once ran nearly 1200 to the
£, the mark, issued on credit, being worth
one-fifth of a penny instead of the old Is.
The table which follows throws some light
on the situation up to a certain point:—
Paper Marks Number Real Value
Issued. to £l. (approx.)
January .. 66,200,800,000 242 £273,600,000
October .. 88,144,000,000 706 126,000,000
Wonderful slumps happen when the credit
is opened a little too wide —given an extra
jerk, so to speak. This 88.144 million notes
were actually worth less than half as much
as 66,200 millions. And then someone must
have issued another note or two, for the camel
broke, and the halves fled in different direc-
tions. And the mark went down like the
Gadarene swine till there were 1190 of it
in a f, so that a sixpenny drink cost £1 9s.
9d. When a mere drink costs that the
price of a drunk is terrible to think of.
♦
The Plague Menace.
From a Northern plague authority:—
Personal and domestic cleanliness is the best safe-
guard against the flea, which leaves the infected rat
when the host becomes cold after death. Fleas congre-
gate for preference in unclean, dark buildings, where
the sunlight rarely, if ever, penetrates. The infected
flea can carry infection for a month, so that, even
though ail the infected rats in a building are
removed, the menace remains whilst an infected flea
remains. To kill the infected flea is to remove
the plague, provided infected rats have been destroyed.
Kerosene and soap-suds, mixed together in equal
parts, will banish or kill the flea.
Sunlight is of great assistance in preventing fleas
from taking refuge in a home; and those responsible
should see to it that the sun, the most powerful
natural germicide, reaches every nook of a building
during its daily course.
Fleas infect not only human beings but also cats.
Cats, therefore, should be kept out of doors; if
allowed inside they should be treated frequently to
a liberal allowance of a disinfectant wash. A China-
man who was found dead in Brisbane had five cats
in his shop, and, on examination, it was found that
four out of the five were infected. He frequently
nursed them. After a post-mortem examination, he
was certified to have died from plague. The China-
man’s residence had been ridded of rats some days
before he died. This shows that something beyond
the killing of rats is called for.
So far, it lias not been proved that dogs carry
infection; but several mice have been found, on
examination, to be disease-carriers. War must
therefore be made on them also.
The public must be got to realise that extra vigi-
lance is called for now in keeping premises scrupu-
lously clean, and in putting all foodstuffs out of the
reach of rodents, not merely because there is
plague in the country, but because the wholesale
hunting of rats will mean that colonies of them will
live, so to speak, on the run, and will ultimately
settle down in houses and buildings where they find
food and are not disturbed.
Should there be a visitation of the pneumonic type
of plague, of which Queensland has had one (doubt-
ful) sample, infection will be carried in the air;
but personal and domestic cleanliness, aided by
medical science and the avoidance of crowds, will
still be the test Safeguards.
The “Big Five” at Work.
The slump in the meat-export trade is not
the least of the evils that afflict Australia.
There is so much of the commodity in cold
storage in England already that the Austra-
lian article is a drug on the market, and for
various reasons it is not easily saleable else-
where. The remedy proposed by the Federal
Country party is that Edward Jowett,
M.P., should go immediately to England,
unofficially and at his own expense, and “ask
the British Government to make a free dis-
tribution of the vast quantities of meat and
other produce now stored, the gifts being sub-
stituted for unemployed doles.” But this
scheme holds out little real promise. If the
meat-congestion is fortuitous, it will have
begun to right itself before Mr. Jowett
arrives; if it is not fortuitous, stocks will
begin to pile up again the moment they are
unloaded. That there is nothing in' the
least fortuitous about the situation is the
opinion of the two men who, in this part of
the world, should know most about the sub-
ject. Premier Massey, speaking in the
M.L. House of Representatives a few days
ago, said :
The Meat Trust was carrying on its operations in
Great Britain with meat bought within the Empire.
It bought some in Maoriland, but not much. Some
found its way to England. Meat was also bought
in Australia.
And W. M. Hughes followed with a state-
ment in Melbourne that “Australian meat-
exporters are faced with the organised oppo-
sition of the biggest Trust in the world —
the American Meat Trust.” All sorts of
allegations have been made against the mon-
ster combine of late—that it is keeping up
prices here against the consumer while it is
pushing them down overseas against the pro-
ducer ; and that, as part of the general cam-
paign, it is to blame for the abominable stuff
advertised abroad as “best Australian beef
and mutton.” However this may be —and
the Trust has been guilty of such practices in
regard to others, even if it happens to be
innocent where Australia is concerned —the
fact remains that it is here and in England,
and that it is not in either place for its
health. According to the last report of the
American Federal Trades Commission, the
power of the Big Five “is being used every-
where to restrict live-stock markets, restrict
international food supplies and to profiteer.”
That is a sufficiently comprehensive indict-
ment, and one that should justify almost
any preventive measures on the part of those
affected. Invariably when drastic steps of
a protective nature are taken against a
foreign business, something that describes
itself as “the voice of the Nation” is pre-
sently audible, protesting that the thing
amounts to an affront to a friendly people.
Thus the U.S. Steamship Owners’ Associa-
tion claimed the other day that “the
people of America were outraged in their
feelings” because the Lancashire spinners
insisted on Galveston cotton being carried in
British ships and insured by British com-
panies. And so with the Meat Trust.
But the claim is absurd. We could per-
form no more friendly act to the people
of the U.S.A. than in doing our bit
in the direction of weakening the
Meat Trust which —again according to
the U.S. Federal Commissioner —“is rapidly
extending its power over every kind
of foodstuff.” The M.L. Government passed
legislation in 3918 compelling every meat-
exporter to have a license, the object being
to debar the agents of the Trust from shin-
ping to England. The best proof of the
effectiveness of the measure was the squeal
that immediately went up. P. D. Armour.
of Armour and Co., actually succeeded in
getting the American Ambassador in London
to protest to the British Foreign Office on
the subject. When the Trade and Com-
merce clause in the Australian Constitution
is altered, as it should be after the coming
Convention, a similar scheme may be made
effective here. Meantime the only ray of
light in the situation is to be found in the
sudden conversion to anti-trust methods of
our big pastoralists and graziers—the gentle-
men who, just before the war, were welcom-
ing the advent of the Chicago combine on
the ground that it would always insure them
regular sales and fat profits.
The Ulster Frankenstein.
J. L. Gabyin, in the London Observer,
which he edits, warned Lister a few ua.vs
ago “not to expect that 2 per cent, of the
Lnited Kingdom will be allowed to deny tne
other 98 per cent, their hopes for peace.
Ulster’s brusqueness and dogmatism,” he
said, “do not impress the public, and are cost-
ing her many friends. Bhe has been offered
an unexampled privilege.” So is the politi-
cal dupe always mishandled when he has
served his purpose. Garvin is a Belfast
Protestant, and in his capacity of Carsonite
Lory he has spent years helping to create
the very spirit which he now desires to
banish. Tne Ulster dread of “Home Rule” ;
the conviction that the “Papishes” of the
South only want a national Parliament in
order to engage in conspiracies against the
Loyal State —these are the yarns that the
brilliant Garvin and other London Conser-
vatives have been circulating to dish the
Radicals for generations. They were suc-
cessful in a measure, as all hatred-propaganda
is. Ulster got to believe that the Catholics
wanted national freedom in order to murder
Protestants, though most of the men who
organised the rebellion of ’9B were Protes-
tants; though Mitchel, of the Young Ire-
land movement, was an Ulster Protestant;
though the Nationalist cause has never been
without Protestant leaders, while the Union-
ist party has always been stiff with wealthy
English Catholics. Pernicious as this work
was in a social sense, there did not appear
to be in it any danger to the Empire before
the war. And even though it led periodi-
cally to bloodshed, it was considered by
those responsible for it that the party ends
justified the means. Now, in order to avoid
anarchy at home and shame abroad, those,
like Garvin, who once warned Ulster that
an All-Irish Parliament would bring disorder
if not death to the Unionist majority in the
Six Counties, have to point out that what
they really meant was that such an institu-
tion would represent “an unexampled privi-
lege.” A more horrible example of the
danger and bad patriotism of party methods
it would be impossible to find; and if
in Australian politics there are any honest
men who love their country, they will take
it to heart where our own problems are con-
cerned.
The Growing Unemployed.
There is no relaxation of the efforts, both
State and Federal, to dispose of the unem-
ployed temporarily on the land, where the
minimum wage is gum-leaves and the hours
are all day, with occasional overtime jobs
by lantern-light. Neither is any loan money
(chargeable in the long run to posterity, for
the settlers will never be able to pay more
than a fraction of their mortgages) spared
either. Yet, despite this and despite all
sorts of wild-cattish public works (also
charged to loans), unemnPvment increases
in the Labor or Go-Slow States. The
Dooley Government’s own Labor Exchange
reported that Sydney alone held 1000 more
unemployed at the end of October than it did
a month earlier. * The worst slump is in
the iron trades, where the 44-hour week has
become the rule. The Dooley Ministry has
a habit of standing round like Jehovah in
Genesis and saying “Let there be more
wages,” but there is nothing in the way of
creative power behind its bull voice and its
roar. The reduction of working hours by
one-twelfth reduced output by at least one-
twelfth, as every manufacturer knew it
would. But, then, there are no manufacturers
in the Dooley outfit, and its only employer,
so far as the public knows, is Dooley him-
self, who once, so it is reported, had as many
as nine wage slaves chained to the capitalistic
car of his country tailoring business. It is
a purely experimental Ministry, acquiring the
ABC of political economy at the country’s
cost as it goes along, and learning in its art-
less way that boiling water is hot by pour-
ing it on other people. The position as
regards the 44-hour week goes into proposi-
tions :
If a business has an output of £12,000 a year
and makes £l2OO a year net profit, which is a
great deal more than the average,
And if, by taking one-twelfth off the working
time, the output is reduced to £ll,OOO a year.
And if the wage cost remains the same, if it
doesn’t actually increase, thanks to Beeby or some-
body,
Then the profit disappears or even becomes a loss.
So the owner, the organiser, the founder and
creator and cause of the business, seeing no
reason why he should be anybody’s serf or
unpaid toiler, closes up the less-payable
branches of the show in order to keep the
others alive. He leaves it to Dooley and
his colleagues to find employment on the new
scale for the men he can no longer employ
himself. And Dooleyism hasn’t created
one productive industry in response to the
call.
Ethics and Medical Ethics.
The B.M.A. (N. S. Wales branch) expelled
Dr. G. 8. Thompson, of Sydney, last Friday
for “holding the medical profession up to
contempt in connection with the Farr case.”
The Turning-point.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bonds strong as Fa-th enchain them —of
love and war and sport;
Of English boys who perished to save an
Irish friend ;
Of struggles waged together in field and
trench and fort,
Where Dublin lads with Cockneys stood
faithful to the end.
There might be full repayment of many a
splendid debt
If England would remember now, and Ire-
land would forget.
The centuries of anguish, when Erin was a
hell
Where Justice died, and Freedom, are
fresh in Irish minds.
Yet Thames-side wives and mothers love
Meath-bred husbands well;
And Celtic hearts send greetings on all the
Saxon winds.
The evil star of ancient hate, with all its
ills, would set
If England could remember now, and Ire-
land could forget.
The Masters of the Ages who used the Eng-
lish tongue,
The God-like ones whose phrases still glow
a noble red,
Are Ireland’s as they’re England’s; and still,
as when men hung
Upon their speech, they’re living. Their
Age alone is dead—
That past which sunders British men who
may be comrades yet
If England will remember now and Ireland
will forget.

A more unfortunate reason could hardly
have been advanced. Dr. Thompson formed
the opinion, rightly or wrongly, that Mrs.
Farr was sane. (And—though this is im-
material —he seems to have been right; at
any rate, the application to* commit her to
an asylum in M.L. was refused.) His col-
leagues assured him that he was mistaken :
that experts had diagnosed the lady to be
suffering from folie circulaire. He remained
unimpressed. But he is not alone in his
distrust of experts. Last Saturday’s issue
of the Medical Journal of Australia
(the official organ of the 8.M.A.) quotes
Lord Chancellor Campbell in the Tracy
peerage case as follows :—-
This confirms the opinion I have entertained that
hardly any weight is to be given to the evidence of
what are called scientific witnesses ; they come with
a bias on their minds to support the cause in which
they are embarked.
Having decided that Mrs. Farr was a
wronged woman, Dr. Thompson engaged
in an “all-in” struggle on her behalf. In
the course of it he made certain statements
alleged to be “in derogation of the honor
and integrity of the medical profession,”
viz.:—•
It is an outrage that private doctors should have
the power to imprison people and move them about
at their own sweet will.
(1) At the instance of a private doctor it was possible
for a person to be arrested and spirited away. (2)
Sane persons could be incarcerated in asylums. Some-
one had only to lay an information and get a medical
certificate. He was not such a fool as to think there
were not any doctors capable of being bribed and
bought. (3) Coroner’s finding and Royal Commissions
prove that an official visit is a farce. The public
have no control over official visitors. Some visitors
are doctors. We want a non-medical board of con-
trol.
No one but a doctor, and very few doctors
except when acting in a judicial capacity as
members of the 8.M.A., will deny that there
are strong grounds for all these charges.
So that the gravamen of Dr. Thompson’s
offehce lay in the fact that he told the truth
publicly about the profession. But the
Medical Journal has allowed an eminent
member of the profession to utter far more
discreditable truisms about doctors in its
own columns than any stated by Dr. Thomp-
son—that many busy practitioners are igno-
ramuses who do not keep abreast of their
work, even to the extent of reading the
Journal, and that others virtually obtain
fees by false pretences. Far from Dr.
Thompson’s attitude having held his calling
up to public contempt, it is safe to say that,
in the opinion of nine unbiased citizens out
of ten, if more doctors had the moral cour-
age to defy convention in the cause of
what they took to be justice, the. profession
would stand higher in the estimation of lay-
men. There is a fairly common type of
medical man who habitually holds his pro-
fession up to the worst sort of contempt:
that is to say, the more or less habitual
inebriate. This class of healer not only
discredits doctoring generally, but consti-
tutes a public danger. Yet rarely, if ever,
does the B.M.A. step in and “make an
example” of him as it has done of Dr.
Thompson. In short. Dr. Thompson’s
offence is not bad public morals, but bad
professional manners. His ethics are of the
highest: it is only his medical ethics that
are at fault.
A Lazy Giant ami a Sinking Fund.
Westralia was launched on its self-govern-
ing career in 1890 with a boiler-plated pro-
viso that its foreign debts should carry a
3 per cent, sinking fund, so that, if they
were reasonably long debts, the money might
be there to meet them when they fell due.
Of late years borrowers have bitterly
objected ■to this. Some have tried to get
the proviso annulled, others have tried to
get the sinking fund out of the hands of
the trustees in England and moved to some
more convenient place—kept in a box under
a hungry Treasurer’s bed, for instance. But
no one of these things came off —happily
for Westralia. Beginning its career in 1891
as the least indebted State (its liability was
then £3O ss. Bd. per inhabitant as against
an Australian average of £47 14s. Id.), it
came to be in 1920 the awful example of
the Commonwealth and the globe, with a
net peace debt of £ll9 12s. 4d. per head
against an Australian average of £76 10s.
4d. The Scaddan madness (1911 to 1916)
added £4O a head to the burden of every
man, woman and infant in the place, and
buried tlie money mostly in wild cats. Yet
the sinking fund was so good an anchor
out to windward that for 16 years in the
last 20 this lazy giant has paid the lowest
interest rate of all the States, and in the
other four years Victoria, the least indebted
State, only beat it by a head. But even the
advantages of a sinking fund may be lost
in the end by hard enough borrowing;
wherefore even West Australia was glad
the other day to offer 6 per cent, interest
and 41 per cent, discount with the usual
underwriting and other commissions to re-
new £3,000.000---£3,000,000 invested in ani-
mals that don’t catch enough mice to cover
their daily expenses.
The German Territories.
The information available to The Bulletin
shows that the most certain thing about the
mandated areas in New Guinea and
thereabouts is that all the preliminaries for
a calamity on the Northern Territory pat-
tern are in full swing. From the day the
Commonwealth acquired the N.T. ' until
the collapse of Gilbutii, no Government
understood what its policy was, no Minister
knew what he was aiming at, no official had
a notion of why he drew a salary, except that
drawing salaries was part of the game. In
order to administer the policy that had no
existence, an expensive horse-doctor was
sent to Darwin. Towards the mandated
areas the attitude of the politicians is the
same. The Hughes Ministry has no more
idea of what Australia shall do with them
than it has of how to mobilise a million
farmers. And to lead the struggle of
achieving an undefined purpose by unknown
means, a soldier has been placed in command
at Rabaul. Now, whatever might have
been done with the Territory the "job was
not a horse-doctor’s. And whatever there
is to do with the former possessions of Fkitz
is quite as certainly not a soldier’s job. A
man might have been a rotten soldier and
yet become a conspicuous success among
cocoanuts. Conversely, a brilliant soldier

might be excused for being a dud among
nuts. Unless the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment has gone entirely mad it will insist
upon having public policy with regard to
the ex-German territories defined. Thus far
it is a mere drift. Not many Australians
wish to see the islands exploited at the ex-
pense of the local nigger. Still fewer have
any yearning to be themselves exploited for
the maintenance of a white elephant. Every-
thing in connection with the mandated terri-
tory turns first upon what use the Com-
monwealth proposes to make of it, and how.
Talk about the country being a field for the
settlement of returned soldiers, about its
natural resources, and its potentialities, and
so on and so forth, must be put aside as mere
froth. The best administrative ard techni-
cal brains in Germany gave the islands close
attention for many years, and that experi-
ence is available for our guidance. Follow-
ing it, we can afford to hang on. But we
certainly cannot afford to let anyone named
Hughes erect here another monument to
his business ineptitude.

The Gratuity Bond Patriot.
A Westralian select committee, mostly
Digger, has been looking into the transac-
tions of some of the philanthropists and
others who cashed Bill’s gratuity bond.
Among those it examined—-nearly all
patriots of unblemished repute and pious
withal was a land-agent named Ches-
ters, who negotiated 108 bonds of the
face value of £10,205. giving the Dig-
ger part cash and part land. Accord-
ding to a couple of expert witnesses, the
land was scandalously over-valued, so much
so that blocks which cost Chesters £2 10s.
were unloaded on trusting warriors for £4O.
In other cases-—those of soldiers who had
no use for Chesters’s lots, but agreed to
buy them on the instalment plan so as to
get money for their bonds—a stiff deposit
was exacted, with forfeiture at a few days.
By this means the noble Chesters sold one
allotment, officially estimated to be worth
£2B, at varying prices (£lOO was
one price) to five different Diggers, from
whom he collected £9B in forfeited deposits,
besides what he expected to make on the
bonds. But therein he miscalculated griev-
ously. An official from the Commonwealth
Treasury gave evidence that before trans-
fers of gratuity bonds were in order he had
to be satisfied that the Digger had got a
fair crack of the whip, and in Chesters’s
case he wasn’t satisfied at all. Nearly
every transaction in which Chesters was
concerned had been held up. In effect, until
Chesters could show that he had made full
restitution, to the men who helped to save
him and his possessions, and of whose neces-
sity or simplicity he took a shameful advan-
tage, he would get nothing for his bonds in
the way of either interest or principal. This
is satisfactory as far as the spldier is con-
cerned, but from the public point of view'
does the punishment fit the crime ? In fact,
where is there any punishment at all? For
surely it can’t be suggested that the burg-
lar is punished if he is merely made to drop
his loot as he runs.

A c.ux from Arthur Shepiiebdson, Town
Clerk of Alt. Cam bier (S.A.) -
The South Aus. Government has agreed to pur-
chase Dingley Dell, Adam Lindsay Gordon's old
home near Mount Gambier (S.A.), with the intention
that, the property be preserved as a National Mem-
orial. It was in this cottage that Gordon spent the
happiest part of his life. While residing hero, which
he did for over nine years, he composed many of his
finest works, inspired by the beautiful natural sur-
roundings. It was here that “The Dedication,”
“Whispering in Wattle Boughs” and “The Rhyme
of Joyous Garde” were written. And here, within a
stone’s throw of the rugged storm-beaten cliffs of
Cape Northumberland, the poet was, no doubt,
inspired to sing his “Song of the Surf.”
The cost of pui’chase and maintenance of the cot-
tage and 15 acres of ground is to be borne by the
Government, with the understanding that local bodies
will carry out the renovations and the setting out of
the Memorial Park. For this purpose a committee
has been appointed. The minimum cost will be
£250.
In its present dilapidated condition the building
is an eyesore. The walls, floors and root are falling
to pieces. A swarm of wild bees has hived in the old
kitchen chimney, and the once white walls are
covered with the scribblings of 40 years. The old
stockyards are showing the ill effects of time and
neglect.
At a meeting held on Saturday, October 29, at
Mount Gambier, it was thought fitting that in view
of Gordon’s strong claim to the sentiment of all
Australians this movement to perpetuate the memory
of our poet should take a national form. Subscrip-
tions are therefore earnestly asked for. I shall be
glad to receive them on behalf of the committee.
From oue of them :
There is talk of the Red Cross closing a small
country sanatorium in X. S. Wales. If so, it is a
tragedy. Not so much because the society spent
some thousands.on it only two : years ago, as because
this class of place (taking some ten or a dozen
patients) is badly needed for chronic or elderly cases,
especially men of education and set habits to whom
the ward system, with its discomforts and want of
privacy, is purgatory. Most of these men are being
pensioned off'. Where are they to live?
One of the patients at the institution in question,
a married man with a pension, sought in the local
town for a cottage. The agent he interviewed,
knowing him for an A.I.F. t.b., refused to let him a
place. On making further inquiries the Digger found
that all the local agents had been warned against
him. Attempts were then made to obtain board,
with the same result. Consider that Digger’s feel-
ings. Having already sacrificed health, happiness
and career for his country, besides bringing his wife
and children to poverty, he finds himself treated as
if he were worse than a leper. It is enough to turn
a man’s blood to gall. Yet in this same town, as
in all mountain centres, there are many civilian con-
sumptives, both in cottages and boarding-houses,
while some of the agents themselves are living there
for their health. In any case, a cottage occupied by
the most virulent t.b. could be fumigated and made
quite safe for a few shillings. Isn’t there some
person or organisation that will take up the t.b.
Digger’s case and see that at leant he is allowed to
end his days in some degree of comfort?
“Rio” : “J.P.” (B. 17/11/’2l) ‘is .right. The
opposition to the Australian Navy came
from the Tories and the Argus and S. M.
Herald, which in politics were part of the
Liberal party. I was at that time a mili-
tary officer on the active list, and because
I believed in an Australian Navy was re-
garded as a sort of Bolshevik. One promi-
nent Liberal supporter kindly told me in the
presence of a number of mutual friends that
if I held such views I was “unfit to hold
the King’s commission.” My reply was
that it was because I was an officer of the
Australian Army that I saw no reason why
it should not be possible to hold a King’s
commission in an Australian Navy, and that
I saw no difference between hiring British
ships to defend us at sea and importing
British battalions to protect us on land. At
this time British military exchange officers
v °ted Labor solely because of that party’s
definite defence policy, and our permanent
officers’ loyalty to Pearce dates from the
same period. Pearce should get more
credit for his work than he does. With
him officers always knew where they were
in matters of policy ; on the other side there
was too much wobbling. It was a Liberal
Minister (Cook) who appointed the only
officer to the staff who got there without
passing the prescribed examination. The
opposition to compulsory training came from
the same quarter. The Argus loved to lend
half a column to “Disgusted Britisher,”
who professed to be leaving the country to
save his boys from becoming conscripts. And
it was a paper of the Argus breed which,
early in 1014. when a total defence expendi-
ture of £5,000,000 was proposed for our
growing army and navy, said that war was
“a contingency as remote as the Millen-
nium.”
A note from North Queensland: —-
1 have just completed a 600-mile motor-tor*" of
North Queensland. In all that journey I didn’t see
one really unhealthy-looking individual. The least
of the North’s troubles is the allegedly horrible cli-
mate. There is mineral wealth going to waste in
the mines round Burketown, but the place is so
isolated that, under present conditions, no company
would dare to work them. There is an enormous
stretch of good cattle country to bo settled, but it
costs more than half the price of an animal to get
it to market. The Government fteamor Douglas
Mawson, ywhich carried supplies to Normanton, was
taken off the run and a slightly" l larger vessel, the
Kallatina, was t* succeed it. But the southern
authorities overlooked the fact that the Kallatina
would not be ready until November. When I was
in Normanton the town was out of flour, potatoes,
kerosene, butter, cheese and biscuits. Unless the
Kallatina gets to work before the rain comes many
stations will be carrying on under siege conditions.
But it is always the way. Ignorant and unsym-
pathetic Southern administration is the curse of the
North. And for all practical purposes Brisbane is
south. Anyway, a crow could fly from Hobart to
Brisbane quicker than it could fly from Brisbane to
Cape York; and if it were proposed that Brisbane
should be governed from Hobart the proposer would
be regarded as quite mad.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The doubt as to whether Massy Greene,
the affable Minister of Customs, has a back-
bone is soon to be decided. Encouraged by
the young man’s anxiety to oblige when the
tariff was returned to the House of Reps.,
the Senate is insisting on a reduction of the
duties on numerous articles turned out by
the hard-pressed Australian manufacturer,
including eight- and 12-gauge fencing wire,
wire-netting, electrical machines and appli-
ances, chaffeutters and horse-gears, cane-
loaders and —harvesters and arsenate of lead.
It also demands that the penny a pound
levied on bananas, which was to have
made that fruit too dear for the hardy toiler
to buy (it has been selling at ninepence a
dozen in the Sydney streets), should be
lowered by one-half. This will give Massy
Greene a chance to dispel the growing sus-
picion that where his spine ought to be
there is a streak of putty.
From the Federal gallery:—
In the dark history of Cabinet-making there is
noihing more diverting to cynics than Hughes’s
effort to fill the vacancy left by Joe Cook. Billy knows
what he wants—-an invertebrate person, preferably a
Cocky, who would encore all his acts in Cabinet—
but though there are several on offer, he dare not
select any one without further danger to his popular-
ity. He is beset by other considerations in trying to
choose a man of more intelligence. He can’t take
the strongly recommended Bruce, if the latter were
willing, because Victoria would be over-represented
in the Government. Chapman, whose claims have been
insistently urged, is disqualified in the eyes of
economists because he stands for the spending of
vast sums on Canberra. Lamond and Higgs, strong
personal friends of the Priminister, couldn’t be
fastened to portfolios without giving the old Labor
wing of the Nationalists a disproportionate voice.
Hughes would probably find a Nationalist majority
in favor of offering a post to Earle Page, Gregory or
McWilliams as the price of swallowing the. Corner
party. But the bait isn’t big enough, though the
Gumsuekers wrangled for two or three days and
drifted into two camps on the matter. This Cabinet-
building is a mad business and offers another strong
argument in favor of elective Ministries.
The belated report of the Queensland Com-
missioner of State Enterprises explains why
the Government was in such a burry to get
into recess withofat disclosing the facts.
According to the overdue document the
deficit on the year’s transactions was
£ll5 7 58. The Government stations mopped
up £58,271, the canneries £29,741 and the
produce agency £27,734, whereas the but-
cheries showed a credit balance of £lB i 6
and the pub weighed in with a profit of
£lo6s—which, considering that the State
caravanserai is a monopoly, without rates or
taxes or contributions to political funds or
insurance against reduction of license to pay,
is a trading miracle. Of course, the
£115,753 deficit is exclusive of the £49,000
sunk at Chillagoe and the £lB,OOO dropped
in the Irvinebank treatment works, not to
mention the million and three-quarters lost
on the railways. Still, the delicacy of feel-
ing which restrained Theodore from telhng
Parliament all about it before that institu-
tion went into retirement for 10 months is
perfectly intelligible.
Hughes’s habit of assuming that he is the
Government is beginning to worry the most
complacent of his colleagues. The other
day, Poynton, Minister for Home and Terri-
tories, gravely denied the accuracy of a
cabled statement to the effect that the British
Government had suggested the taking over
by the Commonwealth of the “Imoeiial
interest in the Anglo-Persian Company’s
search for oil in Papua.” Later on Poynton
had to withdraw his denial, apparently
because Hughes had just rememDered making
an agreement with Britain to buy her share
for £25.000. Of course Hughes had never
thought of consulting his Cabinet. Why
mention a mere trifle of £25,000, anyhow?
From the N. S. Wales Gallery:—
McGirr, Premier Dooley’s first mate, has a queer
serse of humor. “Recognising the importance of
this Motherhood Endowment Bill of mine,” he said,
“I intend to give the Opposition ample time to
debate its principles and criticise its details.” He
did —but pinned them down to doing it all at one
stage, and before half of the 17-hour sitting was
over half the members were asleep in the lobbies
and most of the remainder were practising com-
munity snoring in the presence of the Mace. Of
course, the debate was as dull as a curates’ confer-
ence. But it had its gleams of a sort. An inspired
orator was detailing to the slumberous forms about
him the importance of milk as an article of child-
ASLEEP ON THE JOB.
“ Here, mate, wake up! You don’t want your claim jumped, do you?”
ren’s diet and lightly touching upon the significance
of calories and vitamines. “Bunkum!” interrupted
an angry gentleman named Theodore Hook Hill,
“The children of aborigines were not supplied with
cow’s milk, yet they lived.” The obvious answer
that it was not the children of abos. who landed
at Gallipoli was smothered by stertorous rioting in
the larynx of Jahez Wright. Hill, an old-time
bank-manager, is one of the personalities of the
Assembly. He never goes to sleep, takes' the debates
with intense seriousness, and addresses the crowd
with the earnestness of a missionary. Motherhood
endowment stirred him to extra loquacity. There
were some terrible stories to be extracted from the
hi of Rome under the Emperors, and Theodore

It moves. The next A.N.A. Conference
is to be invited by the Eaglehawk (Vic.)
branch to resolve that the office of. Prime
Minister should be restricted to the native-
born. By adding the words “and persons
of European descent who were citizens of
the Commonwealth at its inauguration,” the
Eaglehawks would bring their suggestion into
line with the provision of the U.S. Consti-
tution. And that provision has worked so
well that any suggestion to alter it would
be merely laughed at.
The compulsory pooling of wheat, as N. S.
Wales knows at, *has received another ad.
One of the expensive accountants engaged
by the Government to rummage among the
accounts and records of the early war pools
—naturally, they are in “a most deplorable
condition" —has discovered that both the
1915-16 and 1916-17 have been “largely
overpaid.” This means that later pools —
particularly 1917-18 —will suffer to the
extent of the overpayments, for there isn’t
a million-to-one chance of getting the Gov-
ernment to stand the racket, although it did
the damage.
N. S. Wales Opposition-leader Fuller said
last week that “a grave resnonsibility would
fall on the Governor if he approved any
more additions to the Legislative Council.
It was difficult, in view of the facts and the
constitutional side of the question, to under-
stand his consent to the previous appoint-
ments.” Which shows that even a lawyer
can live a lifetime in a country and know
nothing of the changes it undergoes. The
veto of our imported Governors is as dead
as the King’s veto is in Britain, and any
attempt to revive it is going to have the
very effect that frequenters of Government
House least desire. “The smaller [Austra-
lian] Courts,” says Conan Doyle, in his
just published book, “are, I understand,
already doomed, and rightly so, since there
is no need for them and nothing like them
elsewhere.” In fact, what our Fullers are
asking is that people in the position of
Governor Davidson should give the coup de
grace to their already tottering jobs to make
a Nationalist holiday.
President Harding will sit up and chew
his cigar when he reads the motion of con-
gratulation from the Australian Senate on
the Disarmament Conference. The final
flourish —that the House trusts the good
work will be steadfastly pursued “till the
Temple of Janus is permanently closed for
troubled mankind”—has a Yankee conven-
tion flavor that will appeal to him. One
yarn current is that a “frind” in the House
went to Lynch and said: “Sure yer not
mixin’ it? Whatth’ell’s th’ Temple o’ Janus,
anyway?” The reply was alleged to be:
“Don’t ye mind reading in y’r school-book
of the Roman god of the gate with the
double face, whose temple was open in war-
time and closed in peace?” “Gocd enough.”
said the doubtful one, and so the Temple
got a revival. Lynch was more fortunate
than Jack Murray when he referred to The
Times as the Old Lady of Tbreadneedle-
street, and Watt when, in reaching out for
Fortunatus’s purse, he grabbed Pandora’s
box, and flung it at a deputation.
Trades unionism should lose no time in
defining its moral character: it can’t afford
to lie under suspicion of winking at larceny
and glorifying the thieves, Wood’s Point
(Vic.T was awakened from a long sleep some
six years ago by the reopening of the Morn-
ing Star. The co. spent about £BO,OOO on
machinery and development, and then began
to get its own back in gold. But as there
appeared to be a big leakage the co. put the
police to work, and a haul of miners ensued.
Some were convicted and sentenced to from
one to three months. The steal is estimated
to have been not less than £lOOO a month on
an average; anyhow, the returns have im-
proved 4 to 5 dwt. per ton since the raid.
Apparently the well-organised thieves were
growing so rich that they could afford to
buy popularity; hence when they were
arrested their mates struck work and stayed
out some days as a protest —against what?
Against bloated Capital’s unwarrantable in-
terference with Labor’s private enterprise,
it seemed. Further, every friend of Labor
in the district was called upon to subscribe
to the Workers’ Defence Fund ; and the only
business man who refused was declared
“black.”
Defending the proposed restriction of the
Sydney municipal franchise to corporation-
laborers, the seedier sort of shopkeepers,
slum-dwellers and those who camp in pubs,
boarding-houses and bug-walks, the exuber-
ant Birt, M.L.A., protested that “these
people have to live alongside unkempt foot-
paths and badly-swept gutters.” Well, whose
fault is it that the gutters are unswept and
the footpaths uncombed? Heaven knows
there are scavengers and repairers enough.
Melbourne last year kept 183 miles of streets
clean and tidy for £61,800. In Svdnev dur-
ing the same period it cost £153,260 to
water, cleanse and ma : ntain 134 miles of
streets, and the condition of some of them
would disgust a cannibal. But the Mel-
bourne City Council doesn’t allow its em-
ployees every Saturday off to be in good
time for the races. Neither are 7 per cent,
of the Melbourne block-boys, dustmen, water-
carters, rat-catchers, asphalt-smearers and
so forth always away on leave.
Elphinstone, M.L.A. for Oxley (Q.), has
infuriated the Nationalist press, which has
been industriously booming him as the rising
hope of the State Opposition, by joining, the
Cocky party. It was Elphinstone who
offered to resign his seat in favor of Tom
ltobinson when a coalition of the non-
Babor groups with Thomas as leader was
talked of. But Tom wouldn’t have it.
A Westralian select committee which has
been learning things about the gratuity-bond
business struck its toughest joint in an ex-
mayor of a Perth suburb, who stood for Par-
liament in 1917 on the patriotic ticket. On
that occasion, as he was duly reminded at the
inquiry, he was reported to have said: .“We
must do all we can for the soldiers.” After
hearing the patriot admit that he bought a
block of land for £2 10s. and sold it to a
Digger for £4O, and numerous things like
that, the committee decided that he must
have been misreported. What he obviously
meant was “We must do the soldiers for
all we can.”
According to Howie and Earsmann, of the
Sydney Labor Council, who have been to
Russia and seen what the Communists
wanted them to see, the famine in the coun-
try of Bolsh is no great size, and “the in-
dustrial classes are well off for food.” If
that is so, there was never any need for the
Soviet Government to humiliate itself by
begging help of the countries whose alliance
it deserted at the crisis of the war, and
whose loans it royally repudiated; and all
that Hoover, Wells, the Cecils and the
Quakers have said about the immediate
necessity of rescuing the perishing was
bunkum. Also, Anatole France, who has
just devoted his Nobel Prize to the fund for
famished Muscovites, is a deluded man. Per-
haps you couldn’t expect him and all the
others’ to be so well informed as two casual
visitors from afar.
“Baree” writes it in Darwin: —
The Akgus objects to the North-South railway on
the ground that it would be too convenient for the
invader. Could you conceive of anything more sel-
fish and less Australian? What becomes of us here
doesn’t matter. Throw us to the wolves so long as
the South isn’t disturbed!
Among other things, Tasmania proposes to
reduce the salaries of its very modestly-paid
Ministers and members by 10 per cent. Income-
tax is to rise a little, and the lottery ticket
will have a ’ sixpenny stamp instead of a
fourpenny one. Away back in last century the
Specklet’s politicians had much the same
extraordinary ideas of finance as those
which now afflict N. S. Wales and Queens-
land. Just before this century was born
the debt was £8,600,000, of which about
£4,000.000 was represented by railways and
telegraphs. They at least paid something,
though not much. The bigger half of the
debt was buried in roads, bridges, jetties,
harbors, public buildings, schools, defences,
other public works, immigration, commuta-
tion of State aid to religion, revenue defi-
ciencies prior ter 1867 and other expendi-
tures. The interest bill just before Federa-
tion came was £316.000 a year, of which
“reproductive works” paid £49,000, and
taxation had to do the rest. The real jag
lasted only a few years, but Tassy will have
a chance to repent in dust and ashes and
apple-blossom for as many decades.
OUR GANDHIS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Rioting on the part of anti-European natives
marked the arrival of the Prince of Wales at Bom-
bay. Gandhi, their pacifist leader, subsequently
announced tnat he would refuse to eat, or to drink
anything but water, until the rioters made peace
with the Parsees, Jews and Christians.”
I met in town the other day
Young Sammy Jorkins, M.L.A.,
A tribune famous for his thirst.
In gloomy thoughts he seemed immersed.
1 said, “What ails you, Sam? I’m sure
It’s something that a spot will cure.”
He wanly smiled, and then he sighed.
“This Irish rumpus,” he replied.
"No, Jinks, I’ll never touch a drop
Until the brawling factions stop,
And Doc. O’Reilly’s League caresses
The Touchells and McNesses.
I met old Homeandrigh, M.P.,
A famous trencherman Is he.
When touring at the State’s expense
His meals are frequent and immense.
“It’s nearly dinner-time,” I said.
'‘You’ll eat with me?” He shook his head,
And thus explained: “Don’t think me rude,
But I’m rejecting solid food.
The contents of a water-bowl
Must satisfy my injured soul
Till Libs and Hayseeds close their squabbles,
And Hughes the Doctor nobbles,”
I met—but p’r’aps it was the brandy
With which I slaked my throat on Sunday:
The simple practice of a Gandhi
’S no good to Gundy.

enough to come out and defend it.”

There has been a re-arrangement of reserves,
evidently to get the co. into line with its
proposed big partner, the N.Z. Insurance;
but some of the figure-juggling is not made
obvious by the published accounts or by the
directors’ reports. Movements have been as

Shareholders were informed a fortnight
before the latest balancing date that thev
could consider their million £1 shares called
to 10s. as henceforth paid to 15s. That
tapped reserves for £250,000, leaving
£790,740 of the accumulation at the 1920
balance plus additions thereto from the
year’s profits. The latest accounts, how-
ever, showed £880,271; hence the entry in
the table: “Unexplained additions to re-
serves, £85,531.” Some of those additions
may also have been from profit earned dur-
ing the year, and not included in revenue
accounts; possibly most of it came from in-
cluding interests in the New York branch
which the South British and N.Z. cos. have
operated in partnership for some years.
The South British’s share of the American
underwriting figures is now included in the
published accounts for the first time, so
despite the world-wide fall in values towards
the close of the financial year premium in-
come was £130,000 larger than for 1920: —

Losses, however, were heavier than at any
time during the abnormal war period:
£70,236 more flowed out than would have
been called for had 1920’s very favorable
claims rate continued. At the annual meet-
ing chairman Elliot had something to say
concerning one of the present-day troubles
of the insurance cos.: —
Losses are heavier.... due partly to claims not
arising from the act of God, but from the act of
common thieving on a stupendous scale the world
over. Until a year or two ago it. was rare for a ship-
per to insure against his goods being pilfered, and
the premium charged for such insurance was nominal.
To-day. .. .shippers have been impelled to insure
against theft of such unhandy articles as cases of
machinerv, carcases of mutton and bales of wool. The
value of "goods stolen is almost incredible, and the
premiums charged for insuring this risk have far from
covered the losses.
But though the marine business was not all
it might have been, 15.0 p.c. of the year’s net
premiums, or more than £141,600, remained
with the South British after paying claims
and all exes., including taxes, contributions
to fire-brigades, etc., and adding 10 p.c. on
salaries to the staff superannuation fund.
Interest and rents, less taxes, gave £84,294
more. This return from investments alone
more than covered the amount required for
the handsome divs. to shareholders. An
interim ninepenw- (7-| p.c.) was paid on
half-a-million of capital; the final was a ten-
penny (5 5-9 p.c.) on £750,000, one-third of
which was bonus scrip issued a few- days
before the accounts closed; consequently 16
p.c. would more fairly represent the year’s
div. rate than the 13 p.c. shown in the intro-
ductory table.
The re-arrangement of reserves puts some
of the South British figures into line with
those of the N.Z. Insurance. In both cases
paid capital is £750,000 and the general re-
serve £315,000. The totals of other reserves
compare as follows: N.Z. {May 31),
£784,010; South British (August 31),
£635,072. Details of the proposed partner-
ship are not yet available; “the negotiations
required to carry through a transaction of
this magnitude and of so novel character re-
quire time,” chairman Elliot told share-
holders at the recent meeting. Altogether
the South- British now has funds exceeding
£1,700.000, compared with £657,000 ten years
ago. The increase has been all stored nrofii
—or, rather, accumulated underwriting sur-
pluses, since £462.000 is a reserve for unex-
pired risks and cannot definitely be regarded
as profit until the risks run out. But note
that this reserve alone is only £37.000 less
than last year’s record losses. Altogether
there are funds equal to 184 p.c. of the
largest premium income collected in any
year, and that is a very substantial backing
to policies. The funds would meet claims
nearly 31 times last year’s losses. Funds are
now at work in this way, compared with pre-
war days;—

The completion of the fine new Sydney
premises has added considerably to the
property item. Shareholders have, of
course, had a wonderful feast. Bonus issues
have increased paid capital from £lOO,OOO to
£750.000 in nine years, and latest divs. gave
old holders 79 p.c. p.a. on the cash they
put in. , *

Estates that came into the co.’s hands for
administration during the year were worth
two-thirds of a million more than those
whose administration was completed, and
the total was thus taken beyond seven mil-
lions. Six years ago it was only 41 mil-
lions. This very rapid expansion and the
higher earnings both of the trusts and of the
co.’s own funds have made the dis-
closed earnings 90 p.c. greater than
those of six years ago. The disclosed
earnings, no doubt, do not include the whole
of the corpus commissions charged on the
new estates put into the co.’s care; like other
big trustee offices this one probably credits
revenue with slices of the charge on capital
only when the management considers it has
earned the money. This shows how the
principal P. and L. entries have moved in
recent years: —

1921 .. 27,672 13,536 4407
Though the inducements to place estates
with efficient and permanent organisations
are probably greater than ever, it is un-
likely that the cos.’ figures will grow as they
have in recent years. Values generally appa-
rently reached top last year, and the process
of deflation is now in evidence. Things are
not all they seemed only a few months ago.
But the trustee cos.’ big line nowadays is
public securities, and not: only is the whole
of that principal practically assured, _ but
so also for some years is a comparatively
high interest return. Real estate values also
have shown no substantial fall. On the
other hand many businesses are making
smaller profits, and that will have a slight
effect on trustee commission earnings.
Though the div. rate is now only 0 p.c.,
the return on the money put into the Perma-
nent is 11 p.c. Until about 18 months ago
paid capital was £50,000, but a similar
amount of reserves was transferred and Is.
per share wap also called up in cash. The
200,000 £5 shares are now called to 11s.
each. The co.’s own funds are invested in
this way:—

The Permanent at one time had more than
half of its funds out on mortgage, but the
same proportion of its belongings is nowa-
days premises, which, having been put up in
the days of comparatively low building costs,
must have proved a good investment.

An interim Is. div. was distributed in
January, and the directors say they paid a
final Is. 3d. in August, together making
11 j p.c. for the year. They show the Is. 3d.
div. as having taken £19,082; on the "Wild
Cat’s” reckoning Is. 3d. on 254,433 shares is
only £15,902. Evidently the final was an
18-penny, and the total div. for the year
121 p.c. The net profit after deducting
the prefs.’ divs. was almost 24 p.c. on ordi-
nary capital, a remarkable return in view
of the crash of prices. That the hand-
some surplus shown is all it should be is
vouched for by the directors: “Stocks have
been valued on a conservative basis by the
management, having regard to the cost of
replacement.” It seems, then, that the luscious
surplus earnings of the war period will re-
main to help future profit-earning. Buckley
and Nunn’s is closely allied with the big
Robt. Reid co.—llobt. Reid chairmans both,
and two other directors of the warehouse co.
are also on the B. and N. Board. Head-
quarters were formerly in London, but when
Reid’s transferred to Melbourne the retail
concern followed, and £150,000 of 7 p.c.
prefs. were issued locally to displace* the
£131,625 of English-held debentures. Ordi-
nary capital is £254,433, £63,613 of which
came from reserves 12 months ago. Balance-
sheet movements over three years have been

than ordinary and pref. capital, so, though
£lOO,OOO or so of reserves are also helping,
at the July balance £49,650 had been raised

Australian Traders’ Insurance Co.,
Ltd. —This little co. made an unobtrusive
start in life a year ago. It issued no pros-
pectus, promoter H. B. Carpenter asked no
founder’s consideration—instead, he paid for
a substantial holding of shares on the same
footing as the friends he had invited in—and
not a penny of the co.’s funds was spent on
inducing the public to join. The concern
has also been given a co-operative touch by
permitting policy-holders to take up shares
at par. There are now 40 shareholders who
have put up £22,200, and, provided the
policy risks a”e right, every penny of that
capital is represented by the best of securi-
ties. And the risks should be a good lot;
Mr. Carpenter managed for the Queensland
Insurance Co. for a score or so years and
has had wide experience in all Eastern
States and in S. Aus. His brothers have
for some years been in the Islands trade,
and have ‘also acted as agents for foreign
insurance cos. So one> way and another
nearly £15,000 of gross premiums were har-
vested in the first year at small cost. Re-
insurances totalled £5345, leaving net pre-
miums of £9577. To help the co. in its first
year the directors accepted no fees, and though
all formation and establishment costs were
charged directly against the year’s revenue
total expenses were only £1435, or 15 p.c.
of net premiums. Losses were £3432, so at
September 30 there was an underwriting
surplus of £4710, £3830 of which was ear-
marked as the customary 40 p.c. reserve for
unexpired risks. Interest gave £1137, so
£2016 went into the appropriation account.
From this the co. has paid a first div. of 8
p.c.; and to that div. little objection can be
taken in view of the selected business appa-
rently handled and the low expense rate, and
because £llll7 of the £1776 required for the
div. was interest earned by investments.
The infant has made an auspicious be-
ginning. Recent insurance floats have gener-
ally been heavily capitalised and have pro-
vided unwarranted gifts of scrip for pro-
moters ; and managements not always so
widely experienced in the intricacies of the
various classes of business as they should be
have rushed round after big underwriting
figures in an attempt to justify the large
capital with which the concerns have been
loaded. One co. in particular lias discovered
that it is now being bled by this foolish
policy. The Australian Traders is going
about things in a different way: “It is the
intention from time to tinie to increase the
paid capital proportionate with the expan-
sion of the business,” the directors announce-
According to accepted standards the co.’s
position is quite all it should be from policy-
holders’ point of view. After payment of
the div. there were £26,270 of funds, equal
to 274 p.c. of the year’s net premiums. And
every penny of that £26,270 was not only
represented by tangible assets but was also
within easy reach; £9960 was in Government
securities, £15,575 at short call, and there
was a surplus of cash in excess of all known
liabilities of £736. Not a stick of furniture
or a sheet of stationery was included with
the assets.

The General Mutual Investment
►Society, Ltd.—This proposed co. is some-
what of a novelty for the Commonwealth.
It is to be chiefly a re-investment concern,
but will also underwrite issues of shares,
debentures, etc., and assist in floating cos. to
acquire businesses which “skilled account-
ants and business men'.’ have approved. The
capital it gets in is to. he re-invested by the
management in directions which it thinks
best at the moment, mining and no-liability
propositions being for all time marred. A
pamphlet accompanying the prospectus ex-
plains :
The individual with the sura of, say, £lOO to
invest confines himself to one investment, which,
through circumstances peculiar to itself, may not be
in a position to pay its dividend. If he were one of.
say, 100 investors, pooling their interests, and invest-
ing in a number of stocks or shares, this detriment
peculiar to the one investment would not apply.
Each investor would receive ,a return equal to the
average of the whole. The Society supplies the
machinery for this co-operative pooling. .. .Advan-
tage is taken of the law of average.
Nominal capital is half a million, but for
a start only 100,000 £1 shares are offered.
The promoting syndicate is eligible for 2500
fully-paids, 500 of which are in return for
undertaking to pay up to £5OO of prelimi-
narv exes., but the balance of the parcel will
not all be issued until 200,000 shares have
been taken up: the allotment is not to ex-
ceed 1 p.c. of the total shares issued. Pro-
vision is made for £2OO per annum for Board
fees, though less will be paid if gross pro-
fits do not reach £4OOO. But “any director
may receive additional remuneration for any
extra or special services.” The promoters
anticipate that 80 to 90 p.c. of gross profits
will be available for distribution among
shareholders.
The float is primarily for the small or
busy man who is not in a position to judge
of the merits or otherwise of any particular
investment. By taking shares in a co. like
this, instead of having all his eggs in one
basket, his risks will be spread. The co.’s
prospects depend wholly on management.
The first Board consists of: T. It. Ashworth,
director of the Insurance. Office of Australia
and of the Life Insurance Co.; Arch. Jack-
son, chairman of the Mutual Store: soldier,
senator and barrister Drake-Brockman,
director of the Commonwealth Life Assur-
ance Co.; and Arthur Robinson, M.L.C.,
director of the Bank of Adelaide, Central
Insurance, Trufood and British-Australian
Lead Manufacturers Pty., and brother to
Lionel, of the Robinson-Clark combination.
Taking it as a whole, the Board isn’t as
impressive as it might be, considering the
services it will be called noon to perform.
The promoters believe they have inaugurated
the co. at a favorable time: —
The financial condition in Australia, in common
with other parts of the world, makes possible the pur-
chase of high-class investments at low prices, due to
many people being in urgent need of money for their
own purposes, and through other financial causes.
This period of stress has revealed weaknesses in many
cos. The skilled investor, therefore, concentrates
his attention on suc-h concerns which —being formed
and operated on a correct and substantial basis-
will bear the strain of this period of reconstruction.
If the directors adhere to a safety-first
policy the co. should early in its career be
able to pay divs. several points better than
savings-bank interest, and judicious selec-
tion of investments may possibly give a
plum or two in years to come. For the small
investor a well-run investment organisation
on the lines laid down for the G.M.I.S. offers
both reasonable security for his savings and
a prospect of a regular fair-interest return.

A Wolverhampton (Eng.) firm has been
given the contract for the supply of the
steam-raising plant for the Vic. Electricity
Commissioners at Morwell. Of the £282,318
to be paid it is stipulated that £137,110
shall be spent in manufacture in Australia.
The rest is for items which, it is claimed,
cannot be made in Australia at a reasonable
figure ; but the division is not too convinc-
ing. To a Glasgow firm has been entrusted
the job of supplying the steel-work for the
power-house at £114,764.
Calcium carbide has crashed from £9O
to under £3O a ton. This has hit
up Gillies’s carbide co., in which the
Speck Government is involved. Since
September 26 95 tons have been pro-
duced weekly, 176 men being employed at
an average of 12s. 9d. per day. Little Mul-
cahy, who acts for the Speck Government
on the Board, is now appealing to
Greene and the Commonwealth Parliament
to keep out all the cheap Jap and European
stuff to give Electrona a chance to live. The
use of carbide for house purposes was cur-
tailed when prices were high, but the de-
mand still runs into about 5000 tons a year.
The “Tasma” works can supply all that and
a bit more, and, incidentally, keep £150,000
a year in the country. There can’t be two
opinions as to what Massy Greene should do.
The Barrier mine unionists have been
hoist with their own petard in the matter of
medical examinations. Prior to and during
the disastrous 1919 strike the union leaders
conducted an intensive propaganda, alleging
that more than half the miners of Broken
Hill were suffering from lead poisoning,
phthisis _ and similar occupational diseases.
The noise being so loud, the Government
was impressed and a Technical Commission
of medical men was appointed to examine
and report. That Commission has dragged
on for nearly two years, but has issued in-
terim reports now and then. In one of these
it named 300-odd diggers, and in accordance
with the promise of the mines and the Gov-
ernment these men have been withdrawn
from the industry and are drawing compen-
sation —the Government bearing one half of
the cost and the mine-owners the other.
Now, however, that the cos. may be called
upon to pay compensation, thev are subject-
ing each applicant for employment to a most
searching medical exam., rejecting men
where the slightest weakness is observable.
The unions naturally are most strenuously
opposing the right of the mine-owners to
examine their employees in this wav; they
contend that if a worker has a certificate
from the Technical Commission testifying
that he is not suffering from pneumoconiosis
or tuberculosis he should not be subjected to
a further examination. But there are 21
diseases mentioned in the Commission’s
schedule for which compensation is claim-
able. The result is that many an old reli-
able miner is being pushed right out of
the industry and the jobs offering are being-
mopped up by newcomers who have no
scruples about going before the cos.’ doctor.

John Brandon saw blue when he wrote
the B. H. Block 10’s latest six-monthly re-
port. Working account shows a deficit of
£8297, part of which was loss on sale of
War Loan, and the rest mainly the cost of
keeping the mine in trim while idle. Lia-
bilities are £17,439, a jump of £3623. Mean-
time these changes have shown up in the
list of more or less liquid assets :
Mar., ’2l. Sept., ’2l.
Stores .. .. £20,549 £18,889
Sundry debtors . . 37,393 30,380

Cash .. .. 3,453 10,177
Concentrates ... 2,203 2,203
£151,059 £150,139
Brandon’s ideas about the metal market are
doleful: he does not expect prices to go suf-
ficiently high to overcome the other disabili-
ties the co. staggers under. The Misima,' he
concedes, looks to be a large mine, but the
financing of that distant gold show has so
gobbled up Block 10 resources that prayers
are being sung for cash to flow from it to
refill the Queen-street till. That cannot
happen until cheap power is on tap, and the
appeal to the Commonwealth to assist to get
the show going on a big scale looks like fall-
ing flat.
* * * *
B. H. Block 14 also is secretaried by John
Brandon, and in its latest half-yearly talk
are similar doleful reflections on the present
and future: “Unless material relief is
afforded from the drastic provisions of the
award the prospects of the mine hold out but
little hope for shareholders.. . .Our resources
have been depleted to such an extent that
our financial position is serious.... and
present and future conditions are so com-
plicated and obscure that no accurate
prophecy can be attempted.” No productive
work was undertaken during the six months
to September 30, but £5416 went in keeping
the mine and equipment in good order. A
loss of £1221 was also sustained in unloading
£11,610 of War Loan. After writine off
£B6B for depreciation, deducting £335 over-
advanced on carbonate ore, and crediting £591
of interest, a net loss of £7248 showed up.
Meantime the surplus of liquid assets (includ-
ing shares in other cos.) over and above lia-
bilities had slipped from £37,760 to £31,380.
Only £3312 of cash was on hand at the
balance.
Veteran Sydney sharebroker Joe Palmer,
chairman of the B. H. Junction North, has
found some silver-lining in the Barrier
clouds. The renewal of leases recently came
up for review. No increase of annual rent
was demanded, but the present royalty charge
of 1 p.c. on net profits has been increased to
3 p.c. on profits up to £lOO.OOO, with an in-
creasing 1 p.c. on every additional £lOO,OOO.
The Junction North directors are “gratified”
at these terms of renewal for a further 20
years, and consider them “far more moderate
than they could have anticipated would have
been imposed.” No work was done at the
parent mine, though a little development was
undertaken at the Pinnacles. There was a
loss of £6427, and a falling off of liquid sur-
plus during the six months from £124,841 to
£116,699.

Cooper and Nephews have pushed on
rapidly at the Ottery arsenic-mine, near Tent
Hill ’(N.S.W.), and the property has now
assumed the appearance of a modern mine,
equipped with every convenience in the way
of machinery and comforts for employees.
During the last nine months a shaft has been
sunk and all fittings completed. A crusher,
connected by trestle truck-lines with the
shaft, has been installed, and the ore now
goes straight from the mouth of the shaft to
the crusher, thereby saving considerable cart-
age expenses. A new rotary furnace has
been erected, and it, with the furnace pre-
viously in use, has enabled a great deal more
stone to be treated. The co. is under little
expense for fuel, as the ore burns itself.
More than 2000 ft. of driving has been done
on the four lodes, and good stone is still
being won. A tunnel is in 350 ft. at 69ft.
below the present levels, and is to be con-
tinued to about 500 ft. This tunnel is partly
to assist in draining the water from the old
and new workings, and also to ascertain
how the lodes look at depth. Several winzes
have been commenced from the ’■■resent 80ft.
level, but water has hindered that work.
Much of the stone is showing good tin
values, so a battery is to be erected soon to
treat this ore. Ten tons refined arsenic
(averaging 99 p.c.) are being sent away each
week to the co.’s works at Cabarita, but the
supply is not yet up to the demand.
* * * *
Tingha Tin’s big water-scheme is well in
hand ; the dam has been completed to water-
level, good progress has been made with
primping plant, and the pipe-line is being-
laid. No. 1 plant has lately averaged 241 b.
per yard, but the yardage handled is not
vet all general-manager Wilson would like.
Meantime No. 4 plant has been ploughing
through 40yd. per hour for 21b. tin per yd.
Despite the booms in other States, oil-
prospecting is at a low ebb in Queensland.
The Wolston bore, near Brisbane.' started
over a year ago, seems to bd a blue duck.
Reports were made months ago that oil-
sands and gas had been passed through, but
no private or official analysis ever saw the
light in confirmation. After bewailing usual
boring troubles to account for delays, Arthur
Morry struck a high note when he asserted
that he was confident oil would be found in
the next few feet. He reckons he is in ter-
tiary oil strata, but the beds are undoubtedly
Ipswich coal measures of Triassic age, or
else all the work in that area bv the Geo-
logical Survey counts for naught. Roma
is still under a cloud, and the inclined bore
to pass the choked-up casing has not suc-
ceeded into getting below the gas zone. It
seems certain that expert drillers, in another
interest, will shortly be on the scene, and
that several new bores will go down. Pro-
fessor David, who has been examining the
field at Premier Theodore’s suggestion and
weighing the pros and cons after swatting
up all the available evidence, does not sub-
scribe to the view that Roma is a “has-
been” oil-field. He is ouietl.v confident that
rock-oil will be found there and also over a
large area between Roma and Blackall. A
large number of e-as spi'ings and oG scums
have been investigated in the Northern
State lately, but all have proved duds up to
the present.

Victas O’l-Shale, which proposes to tackle
the huge deposits in 1500 acres at Latrobe
(Tas.), has been successfully floated. The
directors have given J. A. Wauchope the job
of turning the deposits into dividends.
“G.D.M.’s” breathless protest:—
The warning from the oil expert (B. 17/11/’2l)
got me by the gall. Who wants to be warned, any-
how? I’ve never met anyone who did, and I’ve
never lived more than 440 yards from a Stock
Exchange all my chequered career. Why oil ex-
perts and visiting alleged petroleum technologists
and Government geologists get so fussy about the
gambols of the public, or so angry about the
people’s dealings in a hundred Blowfly Gold Ex-
tendeds at a bob, or 200 Wantajump Oils at ten-
pence, is so hard to understand. All that sort of
advice seems gratuitous impertinence.
As a community Australians have had a more
varied experience of coal, gold, tin, silver-lead,
copper and zinc mining than any other nation;
yes, than any other nation, because here it has been
the privilege of every man, woman, girl, and boy
to buy a few shares in almost any mine at any
time, cheaply and easily. Just stop and think.
Bendigo, Ballarat, Broken Hill, Zeehan, Dundas,
by ell and Charters Towers were the mining fields
where cheap, low-priced shares originated. There
never were shares to be bought at sixpence, a shill-
ing, a half-crown or five shillings in the Comstock
in California; in Cripple Creek, Denver; in Utah
Copper; in Sudbury, Canada; or in Johannesburg
or Kimberley, South Africa. Ten years ago nearly
every Australian understood scrip and had a flutter
in a mine. Since the decline and fall of mining
the population has not had the chance to speculate
But fancy the egregious audacity of any expert, oil
pr otherwise, setting himself up “to warn Bulletin
readers who might profit from a word in season.”
All good Australians (and there are very few bad
’uns by contrast with the humans of several other
countries I’ve wandered over) do three things from
birth—buy shares, get Tatt.’s tickets and put-a-
pound-on. To try to warn such persons not to buy
oil or any shares is to milk the ram, fish the air or
whistle jigs to a telegraph pole and expect it to
jazz!
And, last of all, there is no oil boom in Australia,
or signs of one.
In “W’gabba’s” par. (B. 17/11/’2l) re
the Wolgan Valley (N.S.W.) oil-shales
which John Fell proposes to treat in situ,
a decimal point slipped, with the result that
sulphur contents were stated at 5 instead
of .5 (=4) p.c.
Mutooroo Copper Corporation has more
than its old mine to thank Dick Osborne
for, as with the wisdom of the crow he flew
put of gun reach when the Westralian mar-
ket was hot. So the co. had £lB,OOO of hard
cash to play with, made out of the sale of
shares in reserve. Work done at the mine
has been to prod out from Jessop’s shaft,
where at 180 ft. the lode is as well mixed as
an egg nogg. It is hard porphyritic stuff,
and, therefore, does not give much chance
of ever making good. At 140 ft. the shoot
of stone found to the north has been got
beyond the fault with a width of sft. and
averaging 40s. This is promising if the
shoot lives, which so far has not been proved
anywhere on the field. .John Warrick, who
runs the mine, will push out at the 180 ft.
to see if the shoot does go do./n. Last six
months’ work gave 350 tons worth 50dwt.
The next outside bit of prospecting will be
to see if the lode that has been tried and
found wanting in the Hampton Proper-
ties lease is any better in the Mutooroo.
Since August, 1920, the co. has received
£7327 as the proceeds of gold from 798 tons,
so the grade has been high though quantity
was small. The sheared zone has been
tested, but it is too low in gold to touch.
All that can be said is that Daly did not
make any error when he told Collins House
to get from under in respect to the option
it had over a big block of scrip from
Osborne.

Sydney is likely to be a loser over the
Lloyd George, Coolgardie. A co. was floated
some months ago to work this doubtful
venture, and a milling plant was installed
at once. Now it is announced that the
Govt, will not find the money to lay a pipe
line from the main some distance away, and
the mill cannot be started. It may be better
for shareholders if it does not.
a. J. King, formerly g.m. of Kampong
Kamunting (F.M.S.), is nowadays busy
with Nawng Pet and other Siamese propo-
sitions. G. M. Powell’s new metal-winning
plant is declared to have proved very suc-
cessful in Nawng Pet development work, low
costs having been “convincingly proved.” So
now King is out after new fields to conquer.
He has secured an option over 800 acres in
the Huey Yot valley (Southern Siam), and
3300 acres more in the highlands . adjoining,
and has also lodged applications for water
rights. For 1500yds. in the upper section
and 3050yds. in the lower, 384 bores have
proved a continuous run of tin for an aver-
age width of 200yds. “Several exceptionally
rich bores were excluded and others dis-
counted” in the tally of million yds. esti-
mated to give a minimum recovery of fib.
This ground, King estimates, will give seven
years’ work and a profit of £60,000 p.a. even
at the present low price of the metal. Then
there is the unbored portion of the valley
containing approximately 23£ million yds.,
comprising leases run by John Chinaman,
and as John’s working costs average about
15d. per yd., King believes “this ground is
probably richer than the bored area.” There
also appear to be prospects of successful lode
mining in the high ground, but if that work
does not prove profitable King says there
will be many years’ sluicing in the hillsides
when the water is not required for oper-
ations on the flats. “The consolidation of
unwards of 20 minin** leases to form the
present scheme,” he adds, "is the result of
the current low price of tin, which has made
the Chinese methods unprofitable. The devel-
opment operations at Nawng Pet convinced
the Chinese that an entirely new and pro-
fitable method had come into existence in
alluvial mining, and options, payable for the
most part in the co.’s shares, were readily
arranged.” Nominal capital of the new float
is 11 million dollars, three-quarter million
being offered for subscription.
Allen Bowler is back running mining
shows. This time he is the head and the
front of the Biplane at Harrietville (Vic.),
which is a patchy centre. He testifies that
the mine is only in its infancy, though a level
is out at 240 ft. and a fair amount of driving
and stoping has been done overhead. Latest is
that the reef channel has had a split in it,
which is another way of saying that there is
a bump of country in the reef. That does
not matter so long as the battery can talk
better; so far it has spoken only in whispers.
The programme is to push out the 156 and
240 ft. levels while the driving of a lower
tunnel goes on. When this working cuts
the reef the idea is that there will be 300 ft.
of backs, and that the .show all round will
improve. But the shoots are short, and
unless there is an improvement costs will be
stiff, because of the amount of development
work necessary to keep the battery fed. So
far 1200 tons crushed have averaged lOdwt.
Three managers have tried their hands on
the show lately. Now Carroll, the latest,
thinks that when development is ahead of the
battery there will be a long spell of profitable
work.

GEORGE PREN-
DERGAST, M.L.A.,
leader of the
Labor Opposition
in the Vic.
State House.
Admiral Everett, the new First Naval
Member of the R.A. Navy Board, arrived
the other day. Like his predecessor, Grant,
he sports a black beard and a genial smile.
He comes with an open mind as to the merits
of the Australian sailor- —unlike many other
Royal Navy brass-hats. The published re-
suits of the recent R.A.N. gunnery trials at
Jervis Bay must have given him a good first
impression. Everett is a “gunnery” man
himself, popular with the lower-deck and a
strict disciplinarian where officers are con-
cerned.
A memory of a dead Prime Minister: —
V> hatever he may have professed to be in later
years, there was a period in the career of the
assassinated Hara when he was rigorously opposed
to anything suggestive of democracy. Ten or a
dozen years ago his newspapers promptly jumped on
any movement which had for its objective the en-
franchisement of the Japanese. Though not of titled
birth himself, Hara was a stern upholder of hereditary
government, autocracy, the divinity of the Mikado and
the old, cast-iron traditions of Nippon. I heard
him declare with the utmost emphasis in Tokio that
no country could hope for political excellence which
gave full expression in the management of its affairs
to those who worked with their hands. A coolie
Government, he said, could only make for decadence.
He quoted Australia as a horrible example of the
dreadful condition to which a country that allowed
the workers votes could come. In Australia, he said,
there was no reverence for learning, heredity or tra-
dition. So numerous and diverse were the voices
of the people that the country could not make up
its mind about an importa.t matter like defence;
and only a land governed by a gang of ambitious
coolies would be content to leave so much of its
great coastline open to possible invasion. Perhaps
it was because lie objected to being classed as a
coolie that Hughes refrained from cabling the usual
message of condolence when the news of the Jap
Priminister s assassination came through.

LEWIS COHEN,
who is to he Mayor
of Adelaide in
1922, returning to
the chair he first,
occupied 82 years
ago.
Donald Roberts, the new Judge in the
N.T., is only 32. He is Adelaide born and
trained, a P.A.C. boy who took a good de-
gree at the Uni., and then went as partner
to lawyer Symes at Darwin, working up to
a leading position after Symes died. His
father is a prominent suburban State-
school teacher of Adelaide.
Brisbane last week handed a cheque for
£530 to John MeMaster, who was its mayor
on six occasions, an alderman for 44 years,
and for 17 an M.P. In a public career which
began half-a-century ago the fine old man
was beaten only four times, the last at 80.
One of his proudest recollections, he told his
Town Hall audience, was that he had been
persuaded to enter politics by Samuel Grif-
fith.
Adelaide was half-masted last week for
A. S. H. Crouch, local head of Dalgetv’s.
Born in Melbourne 43 years ago, he m ns
educated at Wesley, had been with Dalgety’s
all his business life, and was appointed
Adelaide manager only a few T months back.
Week-ending at Goolwa, Crouch went
swimming in the treacherous Mundoo chan-
nel, just inside the mouth of the Murray,
and was swept away by the tide, which
there runs like a mill-race. He leaves six
small daughters.
“Half-moon”: On his way from France
to take up Roman Catholic mission work in
Papua, Father Bourjade reached Thursday
Island recently. His modesty nearly got
him through unnoticed, but someone found
out things about him. He is an officer
of the'Legion of. Honor, and has the Croix
de Guerre with 14 citations, the Allies’ Star
and several other decorations. Originally
an artillery officer, he took to flying, anil
28 Hun birdmen wished he’d stayed with
the guns.
Ballarat’s pride in its South-street com-
petitions burned brightly last week, when
the passing of William Duguid Hill was the
local topic of conversation. For 40 years
“Bill” Hill had been the secretary of the
South-street Society, which started as a
school for public speaking. It was as its
sec. that he got his training in the arts
whence his popularity proceeded. Born in
Ballarat 63 years ago, he was always a chief
proclaimer of the importance of his birth-
place, and the Society for Competitions that
superseded the original debating club was
mainly the product of its secretary’s en-
thusiasm. He had his turns at mayoralty,
of course, was prime mover in the amalga-
mation of the rival municipalities, and
wore the first rabbit-skins of Greater Bal-
larat.
Frank Moulden has decided not to go for
a third year of mayoralty in Adelaide, and
Lewis Cohen’s was the only nomination put
in. This breaks all local records, for Cohen
has sat in that chair seven times already.
He is 72, but active still. Liverpool born,
he had experience in Fiji in the early ’seven-
ties, but for the last 45 years has been in
South Aus.
C. C. Reade, S. Aus. Government town
planner, who for a while has been acting
planner in the Federated Malay States, has
made such a success of the job there that the
Governor has recommended his appointment
as Government town planner for three years,
at a salary of £2OOO, plus free quarters,
travelling expenses, etc. Should this be
approved he will have to return to Adelaide
for a little while to complete some depart-
mental work under way before formally hand-
ing the S.A. Government his resignation.
Tom Skeyhill spent his last few days in
Australia booming Chautauqua, the Ameri-
can organisation for broadcasting lecturers
and entertainers over the country. Skey-
hill’s own lecturing contracts are with Chau-
tauqua. and he can’t see any country that
needs its services more than Australia.
“Something must be done to make life
brighter for the people who live outside the
cities,” he says, “and if you don’t want to
import an idea from the U.S.A., then it’s up
to you to invent a better one of your own.
Daney Nicholson, manager of the Mt.
Elliott copper-mines (Q.)> who has been
selected to oppose Theodore’s man for the
Flinders seat, was once an amateur light-
weight champion in Melbourne, and brother
Bob was a crack oarsman. Bob died whilst
managing the Ivanhoe, one of the best
Golden Mile properties. Daney himself was
in Westralia for years, having been associ-
ated with the South Kalgurli, Golden Pole
and Lancefield. He owns a grazing pro-
perty up Cloncurrv way, and is such a dead
shot that the plain turkeys offer up a prayer
when he lifts the gun.
“T. 0.1.”: Apropos publican Collins and
Melbourne City Council (B. 17/li/’2l). In
the early ’sixties Bung practically ruled the
corporation. There were Gallagher, of the
Rose of Australia: and Joseph Storey, who
kept a pub out Hotham way ; and George
Hughes, who had an interest in several;
and John Thos. Smith, who, though retired,
had made his money in a pub ; and Michael
Keeley (retired) ; and John Edwards, sen.,
solicitor to the L. Victuallers. In addition
there were Richard Fades, M.D., and coun-
cillor Kenny, of Sands and Kenny, both of
them friends of Bung.
A large oil painting of O’Shanassy, thrice
Premier of Vic., now hangs in the lounge
of the State Assembly. Present-day mem-
bers are puzzled at the plush seats of the
Uppah Chambah shown as a background
for the figure, as the scene of “Big
Jack’s” triumphs was, of course, the Assem-
bly—in the late ’fifties and early ’sixties.
But O’Shanassy w r as a member of the Land-
lords’ House from 1868 till 1874, intending to
end up his career in the quiet Chamber.
Service, after his Premiership, moved the
same way. The love of conflict brought the
Irishman back. Service was Scotch and
didn’t try it.
“Smike”: Probably no two brothers dif-
fer more in temperament than Herbert and
Norman Brookes, who hold a big interest in
the Australian Paper Mills. Norman is the
tennis-player and golfer who shines in the
social firmament. His thoughts never soar
into philosophical realms of knowledge, and
when he publishes his autobiography it will
deal with his triumphs at tennis. On the,
other hand, Herbert, the ; elder brother, is a
solemn, well-read man whose marriage with
Alfred Deakin’s daughter made life an in-
tellectual recreation. Both husband and
wife are aesthetic and musically inclined and
dabble in isms that enjoy the patronage of
great minds. Years ago it is alleged they
caught from Alfred Dealdn the cult of
Fletelierism, and they were also infected
with Alfred’s uolitics to such an extent that
Herbert became one, of the banner-bearers
of the Liberal He has never tried
to enter Parliament, but he long ran a paper
in the Liberal interest and finaneied it
mainly out of his wn pocket. The sheet
eventually died, but he soon discovered other
pursuits. At presen: he is presiding over
an association to acclimatise the Chautau-
qua form of entertainment. Lending his
name to causes with the slightest intellectual
complexion is one of Herbert’s main diver-
sions, and it is probable that he is more use-
ful in his modest way than his well-adver-
tised brother, who has spent much of his
adult existence in knocking a foolish little
ball about.
A quaint faction is the Northern Country
party of Theodore’s State. It consists of
two members, and Billy Green, of Towns-
ville—-mayor, druggist, local preacher and
prohibition advocate, albeit no one ever
called him a wowser—is the leader. Bill’s
deputy is Jacky Jones, of Britannia station,
A1.8.A. for Kennedy. He is one of four
brothers, whom the district would back to
take on any other four in the world with the
bare knuckles.
“Ando”: Probablv the only living member
of the Burke and Wills expedition is Wom-
bey, a pensioner at Nocatunga (Q.) cattle
station. Wombey joined B. and W.’s party
at Pamamaroo (Menindie). along with two
other nigs, and travelled as far as Bulloo
Downs (S.O.i.
where he and his
mates were paid
o fif and Queens-
land Binghis sub-
stituted. The old
abo. carries his 80-
odd years well, and
plays a same of
draughts likewise.

On a restless Radical :
the most adventurous and versatile of Australian
Reds is Alf Vt. (“Barcoo”) Wilson, sec. of the
Workers’ International Industrial Union, who holds
forth on Sundays in the Adelaide Botanical Gardens.
Born at Sandford (Vic.), where his father was a
teacher, Wilson worked as a boy for farmers and
road-contractors, and studied hard in his spare time.
At 17 he crossed to N. S. Wales and toiled on
Tuppal station. Two years later he travelled to the
Klondyke, where he met Jack London, J. J. Under-
wood and Rex Beach, and he was a pioneer of the
Cariboo rush on the Fraser River. Three years as
coal-trimmer and fireman on the coast between
Seattle and ’Frisco followed, and in 1901 “Barcoo”
returned to Victoria. But not to settle down. He
was prospector, miner and barman; followed the
rush to Tarcoola (S.A.), and thence to Arltunga;
went back to Melbourne and started first as a fruit
merchant and then in wood and coal; studied for the
Anglican ministry and preached under license from
a bishep. Finding he had no vocation for the
Church, he went on his travels again. This time
he took to wharf-laboring' varied with metal-mining,
and visited every State in the Commonwealth. He
became president of the Port Phillip Stevedores’
Union and a delegate to the Waterside Workers’
Federation, where he crossed swords with W. M.
Hughes. In 1915 “Barcoo” revisited British Colum-
bia, stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Jack London at
their ranch in California and did a bit of placer-
mining in Alaska. Back to Australia lie was a
fervent anti-conscriptionist in 1916 and 1917. The
indefatigable man lias written a novel, “In the
Days of Our Youth,” which has been accepted by
a London publisher. He will probably contest a
South Aus. seat at the next Commonwealth elections.
He is still only ii.
Now that they have £lOOO a year Federal
members don’t keep their drinks and tucker
on the slate as long as they used to do. At
June 30, 1921, they owed the Parliamentary
refreshment-rooms only £144, or less than
30s. a head. A year earlier the amount was
£892, or just over £8 apiece. But the tax-
payers still had to subsidise the show to
the extent of £2141, very little short of
£2O a member, to make both ends meet.
Why not go the whole hog and give mem-
bers suits, boots, shaves and Turkish baths
under cost price? Not to mention the ser-
vices of a blond manicurist.
. Norman Lindsay never does anything that
gives more joy than his Bear fancies, and
he introduces Billy Bluegum to the Christ-
mas Bulletin. Leason’s two most popular
pages so far have dealt with the country
show and the country football match. In
this Christmas number there’s a hilarious
drawing of the country race-meeting—
“ Sandy Blight Wins the Christmas Cup.” A
third page is one of Minus’s unequalled abo.
studies. There ai‘e other drawings, with
plenty of good humor in them, by Low,
Souter, Mab Treeby (this Australian
girl is now in the front rank of illustrators
in London), and 30 others; there are 25
of the best short stories ever got together in
Australia ; and the verse will be found from
good to middling. The Christmas Bul-
letin will be published on Saturday,
December 10.
I DO ADMIRE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I do admire a neck that’s white,
And round, and veined with blue ;
It is, I say, a wholesome sight
For Adam’s kind to view;
No wrong is in a pretty arm
The poet can construe.
And if a maid or matron fair
A lovely neck can show,
With curling wisps of raven hair
Set oft' against the snow,
1 would not have it hid away
For all the saints I know.
I do delight in plump, strong arms
Where dimples sweet abound ;
An elbow has its pleasant charms,
A wrist that’s white and round
A gift of Heaven is wherein
Much comfort may be found.
1 like a shoulder rounded, too,
With sleekest velvet skin,
As sleek as lilies tall that show
The garden’s shadows in.
To give its beauty to the light
I swear is not a sin.
I take joy of a natty limb
That's pink as is the rose.
If not o’er large, nor yet too slim,
And dight in silken hose,
The maid does well to give a glimpse
To Adam as he goes.
And if a lady so complete
Possess a lovely neck,
A rounded arm, and ankle neat,
A shoulder without fleck,
Or show her arts upon her arms,
I am no daw to peek.
Nor do I think the gods have more
Than thunderously laughed
At saint who sees corruption sore
Immovably engraft
Where they with happiness behold
Their perfect handicraft!
VICTORIA.

SOCIETY
BREARING IT GENTLY TO
SCRATCHER.
SCRATCHER: “Sent along three drawings to
that paper, and I'm hanged if they
weren't returned. That editor cove
doesn’t know a good drawing when he
sees one.”
THE OTHER : “H'm — no, but he probably
knows a bad one, Scratcher.”
“T.R.H.” : In this little Yic. village where
I am staying I saw the other day seven
voungsters solemnly march into the grave-
yard, headed by a boy of 10 who reverently
earned a large boot-box. Arriving at a tiny
grave the 10-year-old read a
and a little girl recited "i ioved little pussy,”
after which the coffin was lowered into the
grave. As the mourners left I asked the
young parson whose pet cat they had buried.
“We were burying an unknown soldier!” he
answered impressively. In this lugubrious
State even the kids take their pleasures sadly.
“Spare Corp”: A N.S.W. divorce case the
other day showed the Censor in the part of
Nemesis. Private Lothario had been writ-
ing letters to girls in England and to his
wife in Australia at the same time. After
being read by his platoon officer, the mis-
sives had gone into the wrong envelopes,
with the result that the wife, whose name
was Ellen, received kiss-crossed screeds in-
tended for Mary and Ethel, and referring to
glorious times in England. The thing
might have been done deliberately; but usu-
ally the pip-artists who had to read the
Digger's letters were sports. Sometimes, find-
ing a married Digger posing as single to a girl
in England, an officer might enclose to the
lass a letter meant for a wife in Australia
as a warning; but he wouldn’t go as far
as to send other letters on to the wife. One
officer who did this suffered as a consequence.
He was suspected as a “wowser,” and a trap
laid for him. An unmarried Digger sent
in one mail letters to his girl in England
and to his “wife” in Australia, the trap in
the meanwhile having been explained to the
English girl bv a leave-taking pal. By the
time the answering mail came, from Aus-
tralia the Digger had conclusive _ evidence
of the officer’s interference with his corres-
pondence, and, the authorities taking a
severe view of the affair, Mr. Pip was
cashiered.
* * * *
“Country Ped.”: For the past few weeks
good teachers who are supposed to be educa-
ting all the children in their schools have
slacked off six grades and concentrated on
the sixth and eighth. We have become
crammers, trying to force pupils through
either qualifying-certificate or merit-cer-
tificate examination. And all because a
teacher’s promotion largely depends on the
number of certificates gained by his school.
An alteration in the system is urgently
necessary. Cramming is no substitute for
education. In Vic. a start has been made;
merits are awarded to Q.C. winners who
have put in two years in the seventh and
eighth grades, and done satisfactory work.
Still, that leaves an exam, with its cram
for the Q.C. Why shouldn’t that certificate
be awarded on the teacher’s recommendation
backed by the district inspector?
* * * *
“T.W.”: Mention of Margolin’s Yiddish
battalion (B. 3/11/’2l) recalls personal ex-
periences of two of those queer collections
of soldiers, the 38th and 39th Royal Fusi-
liers—otherwise Whitechapel’s Own. They
were guarding prisoners of war at
Heliopolis, and most of them had no
English beyond the usual sentry calls.
“Advance,' and be reckoning!” most
of them said when they called to you
to step forward and be recognised as
friend or foe. With
the exception of offi-
cers and n.c.o.’s they
were conscripts to a
man, and then- men-
tors, a particularly
smart lot, frankly de-
spaired of. ever lick-
ing them into decent
soldiers. There was
a great flourish of
trumpets in England
about the formation
of the Jew battalions
to fight for the re-
covery of Palestine,
but they had so little
of that sort of thing
about them that they
saw nothing of Jeru-
salem the GoMen or
any other Zionistic
objective until the
Auss i e s had well
mopped up the sur-
rounding country for
them. The two bat-
talions I am telling
about had even to be
taken off guard work
because they were
continually popping off their shooting-irons
at passing' Arabs and at orderly officers going
across the desert to see them on dark nights.

“Centurion”: My infantry chum’s lot
were hard on the heels of the flying Hun
when a ramshackle old estaminet just ahead
of them suddenly hunched its shoulders,
sneezed smoke at every crevice, and then
collapsed, spilling its contents right at the
feet of the platoon. Among the debris was
a large singed Hun. who had evidently been
sleeping it off in the attic, in blissful un-
consciousness of the fact that his mates bad
mined his doss befoi’e leaving. Some of the
lads stood him on end and put out his
smouldering clothing, while he gazed stupidly
about him. Then his eye fell on the rums
of the estaminet, now burning furiously, and
he turned grinning to his captors, whose lan-
guage he knew. “Py Jimmy,” he said, “I
got oudt choost in dime, aind’t it?”
THAT ACCOUNTS FOR IT.
“What do you think of the pudding? I made it out of that new cookery-book.”
“Well, darling, I think the leather binding rather spoils it, don't you?”
“Friday Island” : A great Oriental Power,
wishing to honor an Admiral of the Royal
Navy after a successful career on the China
station, invested him with a certain Order
of the First Class. Women are not allowed
investiture in Orders of the First Class, so,
as a cojnpliment to the Admiral’s wife, the
Power bestowed on her the next-best honor
—the same Oroer of the Second Class. From
the white man’s viewpoint it was unfor-
tunate that the honor happened to be the
coveted Oriental Order of Chastity.

“Tim Tiki”: King George seems to _be
having bad luck in his economy campaign.
He is reported to have appeared at the races
at Goodwood recently with his trousers
creased down the side. Apparently the mat-
tress shifted during the night.

“Pat Roll” pictures two caged lions: —
Government by scraps of paper (B. 20/10/’2l) is
not confined to Australia. Papua can show some
records, too. Consider the case of Jones, R.M., and
his faithful assistant, Brown. They were on a
station where the miners on Sundays used to spell
their teams of “boys” and worry the Warden with
all sorts of business. Jones disliked these Sunday
visits, so he wrote a minute to Brown and instructed
him to “notify the general public that Sunday was a
day of rest.” Brown sent a circular letter around
the claims to advertise the fact. Then he minuted
the notice on to his chief —who sat at a table in
the same room some 10 feet distant. Jones knitted
his brows, looked extremely dignified, and marked
the screed “Seen. Hercules Jones, R.M. and Warden.”
Next Sunday a miner floated along to buy a miner’s
right, and Jones raved with anger. He was so wild
that he simply had to write a “Please explain” to
Brown. The latter had a touch of malaria and a
tropical liver that day, and presently he handed over
a minute in which he referred to his superior’s pro-
tests as “nonsensical.” Whereupon there emerged
frightful language from the man 10ft. away and he
punched out of his typewriter an answer that he
reckoned would “take the paint off Mr. Brown.”
It did. Brown informed his superior exactly what
he thought of him; and Jones promptly responded
with an amazingly libellous picture of Brown’s
family tree. At this stage the interchange of notes
and minutes over 10 whole feet of distance came to
a sudden and very violent end —and it took two
house-boys and four policemen a strenuous five min-
utes to prize the fighting oflicials apart.
“Centurion” : Our first and (perhaps) last
battle-cruiser, the Australia, has been
lying in Sydney Harbor and flying a
paying-off pennant 200 ft. long. This pen-
nant, the like of which hasn’t been seen in
Australia since the days of the hired fleet,
represents one of those unauthorised observ-
ances which make up the mass of naval
tradition. Made by the signallers at the
Lower Deck’s expense, the pennant should
measure an inch for every day of the ship’s
commission. In the old days of the West
Indian and China stations, a flagsh’p might
be in commission ten or a dozen years. If
so her paying-off pennant was something to
swear by. and to keep the whip from flog-
ging to thrums on the water a gilded bladder
was attached —a gadget that wasn’t called
for on the Australia, though seen often
enough in the old fleet. After the pay-off
the pennant is hauled down, and is sunposed
to be either burned or given sea-burial, as
circumstances —liquid and otherwise—
permit.
“Percy P.”; Amongst other things you
are liable to get from reading library books
is the quaint humor of marked passages.
The habit of underlining passages or mak-
ing marginal notes springs no doubt from
the human desire for communion with one’s
kind, and a hunger for the sympathy of
others, even although the author* of the cry
remain anonymous. This is to notify one
lady in particular that she has mine. In
the book I have been reading I found a pas-
sage which began: “Who can blame a
woman whose 50u1”.... It was under-
lined deeply, and in the margin was the
remark: “Yet the Judge gave my husband
a divorce!”
* * * ft
“O.Iv.”: The spirit of Europe’s Middle
Ages would have groaned if it had heard
Sam Mauger read the plans of proposed
alterations to the building in Russell-street
where Dr. Charles Strong’s Australian
Church is to do the Lord’s work. The build-
ing is to be of two storeys, with power to
add to the number when funds permit;
ground-floor offices for letting are expected
to bring in £2OO a year, and a hall on the
first floor another £l5O if it be let twice a
week. The offices on the ground floor—will
they be let to s.-p. bookmakers for the edi-
fication of those good Christians who oppose
the tote? But at least the new Australian
Church in Melbourne should have one pull
over the uncompromising structures with
tall steeples where fashionable weddings are
THE DIPLOMAT.
JEAN : “But why can't you take me home
and introduce me to your people?”
JOHN : “Well, you see, mother's so fright-
fully jealous of father.”
celebrated. It should have no terrors for the
agnostieal sinners who object on principle
to entering sacred edifices. Why not in-
clude a cigar-shop and encourage them to
even loiter on the premises?

COMMUNITY SINGING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“We venture to hope that great social advantages
may accrue from community singing, as established
in Melbourne during musical week. The community
singing has served to bring the people together in
harmony, and may yet establish the amenities where
only bitterness has hitherto existed.’’
The trouble with these Orangemen
And stern upholders of Sinn Fein
Is that they do not warble when
They come together. It is plain
If in the House we form a choir,
And have all sing a pretty glee,
We’ll have no more the fractious ire
Of politics, and shall acquire,
If not quite peace, then harmony.
The auctioneer shall lead his band
Of buyers with a wand, and tell
In song the praises of the grand
Etceteras he has to sell;
And cattle salesmen, who create
So fierce an uproar in the dust,
And wild wool-brokers too shall state
Their case in tune, with cries elate.
In fact, it’s time to say they must.
When pushes in the streets begin
To dint the coppers, let us sec
Them singing songs of gladness in
Harmonious community.
How sweet to tired housefathers, sith
Soft night has driven out the irk
Of striving day, to hear his kith,
A-bed, all join in softly with
The burglars singing at their work.
And there at Flemington below
The elms where all was turmoil dire,
We’ll hear the music sweet, I trow,
Attuned to the tinkling lyre—
A grand community of song
Where no marsupial Homer nods,
And Melba leads the whole day long
Bookmakers in a mellow throng
Divinely singing out the odds!
VICTORIA.
EDDYSON.

“Rio” : At a N. S. Wales Red Cross home,
every inmate of which is incapacitated, to
some extent, for life (many of them have
wives and children struggling to live on a
miserable pension), I saw women on Armis-
tice Day asking the poor devils to buy pop-
pies at a shilling each “to help our sick
soldiers.” Hut they are not all like that.
AN ALIBI.
“Then your husband's jealousy is un-
founded?”
"Yes, absolutely. He suspects the wrong
man."
Another lady sent a large bunch of beauti-
ful poppies “with her kindest thoughts and
gratitude.”
“Te Pana” : Ilori told the sergeant there
was a man in his whare annoying the?rnissus.
“You come te pah, t’row that Jplar. out,”
he urged. After a mile walk the sergeant
found an undersized iriuividual sitting over
the whare fire and a Maori woman crouching
in the corner. The policeman grabbed the
intruder and shot him into the night. “Now,
Hori, why didn’t you do that yourself?” he
asked. “Oh, me too much fright te law.
That ferrar te bailiff.”

“Memor” : Coincidence, or—what? In
September, 1917, when the 4th Divvy camp
was in the llouelles Valley, some of the tents
were sheltered by a row of tall poplars. On
a howlingl.y windy night a Digger in one
of the tents was aroused about 1 a.m. by
the sound of his name. Drowsily he listened,
and again he heard it. Then he looked
round and saw that all the others in the
tent were sleeping. He became uneasy, and
decided to sit up for a while and think
things over. Presently he heard quite clearly
the same voice calling him from somewhere
outside, and finally he got up and went
to investigate. He hadn’t gone 10 yards
from the tent when the nearest tree crashed
across it. The men sleeping on either side
ALL IN HIS HANDS.
“So you leant to marry my daughter! Well, what arc your prospects ?”
“Oh, excellent— if you don’t spoil them.”
of the spot where he had lain were killed. I
saw them next morning being sewn in their
blankets.
"SX” : All the souvenir kings did not be-
long to the “other ranks.” After the Yeo-
manry cleared out at Romani all hands of
the 2nd Light Horse Brigade helped them-
selves to what the other chaps had left beh.nd
in camp. A few days later (after we had
knocked back their claim for £1200) Dallas,
their brigade majah, was given permiss'on
to visit our camp and take all articles that
could be identified. A well-known Melbourne
med.co had to keep under cover during that
visit. He was wearing a pair of Dallas’s
pants.
* * * *
“Exul” : A general practitioner gets some
queer calls. One night a sick fellow-
sawbones in a neighboring suburb
asked me to pay a visit on his behalf.
The district was unfamiliar, and I
had quite a job finding the patient’s
home. When I arrived I was ushered
into a family conclave and asked to
consider the case of the youngest
daughter, a flapper of 14
-—how to prevent her
from going out walking
with soldiers. The kid
protested that she always
bolted at the sight of a
uniform. 1 suggested
that, if they didn’t be-
lieve her, they should
lock her up or hide her
clothes. Although ray
advice was eminently
practical, they were quite
hurt when I demanded a
fee for it.
“Monaro”: There is a lot to support the
theory that accidents happen in sequences
(h>- 10/11/’2l). I was one of six men chaff-
cutting at Ganmain (N.S.W.) when the boss
one morning badly gashed his hand while
sharpening up. Within an hour or so three
of the others had accumulated a cut leg, a
sprained wrist and a twisted finger. Next
came a badly bruised shoulder, whose
owner was sprinting to the house on
a bike for bandages when a piece of
wire fouled the back wheel. The fifth
man then varied the collection with a broken
arm. He was yoking up to leave the field of
battle when his horse jambed him against a
water-cart. At Picola (Vic.) a man lost a
finger in a debate with a circular-saw. “He
did it as easy as kiss your hand,”
said his brother, illustrating, and swish!
--the brother was minus the same
finger. At Plugger Bill Martin’s hotel in
Melbourne an athlete lost an eye through a
bursting soda-water bottle. A photo of him
standing on the table was also neatly drilled
through the same eye.
* * * • - *
“Verri”: Maoriland is a cold place for
straying husbands. Some years ago. before
the passport inquired “Who’s the lady?” an
M.L. solicitor booked a passage to ’Frisco
for himself and the typist. His wife heard
of it, but as the gentleman was not a tre-
mendous loss she made no immediate pro-
test. Still, she wasn’t altogether passive:
and Wlien the husband sought his cabin
he found a shrieking infant—his—-in
the bunk, with a note advising that as his
spouse was going to work to support the
two elder children she declined to be ham-
pered with a nine-months-old baby. It quite
spoiled the trip, for both himself and Fairy.
The baby was promptly adopted by the
women on board and grew plump and cheer-
ful, the typist shut herself in her cabin, and
the wretched man paced the deck under the
freezing stare of Eveiywoman. Arrived at
’Frisco the lady disappeared, and the dis-
heartened man booked back to Auckland with
the baby, lie gave cut that he was a widower
taking the infant back to its mother’s people.
On arrival his wife collected him without
comment, merely remarking that she was
glad the trip had done the baby so much
good. He is now an elder in a suburban
church.
"J. Carew”: The area-officer nearly fell
down when he read the subjoined missive
from the incorrigible of his section :
Dear Sir, —I hereby resign from compulsory train-
ing. I don’t like it.
And evidently the bright youth meant what
he wrote, for he hasn’t attended a parade
since.
_> /“Friday Island”: “Azrim’s” gibe (B.
3/IT/’2I) at the campaign against pyorrhoea
alveolaris is unwarranted by the facts.
Pyorrhoea is not a recent fad. Recognition
of the ills due to its body-poisoning habit
has been impress-
ing itself on the
medical mind for
11 years. Fe w
surgeons practised
Arbuthnot Lane’s
crank-inspired ex-
cision of the colon
as a cure for cos-
tiveness. But ap-
pendicectomy is a
horse of another
color. It has come
to stay. More ap-
pendicectomies • are
performed to-day
than five years
ago, and the death-
roll from “colic,”
“peritonitis” and
“bowel inflamma-
tion” is greatly
lessened. Fewer
tonsils are excised
than in 1918 be-
cause medical
science has re-
cently found that
tonsils secrete a
“hormone,” or in-
ternal secretion, of
value. But with
removal of teeth to
cleanse the gums
of »us cavities one
is not removing
glands or organs
which may pos-
sibly secrete
“hormones.” A
patient with clean
gums and • artificial teeth is better off than
one with natural but (unnaturally) septic
chewing apparatus.
* * * *
“Briefless” : At a Melbourne court a few ,
days ago Judge Dethridge had to deal with
an unfortunate old fellow, G 3 years of age,
who had been found trespassing on the
premises of a South Melbourne citizen. He
explained to the Judge and jury that he was
a carpenter and house-renovator. He had
received a letter, addressed, as he thought,
from the house where he was arrested, ask-
ing him to come and make certain altera-
tions. Finding the door open he had walked
m and was looking round the place with an
eye to needful lemodelLng v>nen .somebody
grabbed him, and then hustled him off . to the
police station. All that was wrong with
the story was that when the householder
discovered him he was making inquiries into a
chest of drawers in a bedroom; so the jury
iound him guilty—reluctantly, and with a
strong recommendation to mercy on account
of his age. Then the poor old chap had
to admit to 10 previous convictions, ranging
flora larceny to housebreaking and burglary.
Also he had to further admit that 10 years
ago he .was declared a habitual criminal and
oidered to be detained in a reformatory at
the expiration of a term to which he was
then sentenced. It appeared further that
on emerging from a spell in the reformatory
he had taken an cath that he would never
again commit a dishonest action. And
most likely he meant it. “God in Heaven
knows what possessed me in making such an
utter ass of myself,” said the unwise old
gentleman, when ho was asked what he
thought of the whole position. Nobody
save God in Heaven can possibly know why
habitual criminals continue to crim. The
jurors didn’t know. but., all the same, they •
withdrew their recommendation to mercy.
Perhaps Judge Dethridge had a suspicion
that the nlai’s'ble, danporous iiTPolaimable
offender of (>3 couldn’t help himself. Any-
how, he remanded the problem for sentence.
What can the Law reasonably do with a
man like that?
* * * #
“Leman”: I had to call on an expro-
priated German in the gaol at Rabaul—
he went there in lieu of paying some im-
nossible fines. The gaol was overflowing.
“Well,” said the German with a grin that
was quite sot d-natured —“you see the Brit-
ish are still holding their own.” The last
count had given two more British prisoners
than Germans in the calaboose.
* * * «
“Friday Island”: “Mirza’s” lady from
Lake Como (B. 3/ll/’21), who enriched the
world’s population by a sextette, cannot
boast in the presence of the I'ansienne who
added a baker’s dozen to her household within
12 months of the honeymoon. I didn’t know
the lady personally, but her photo is (or
was) in a book belonging to the library of
Sydney Uni. Medical Society. As in most
cases of multiple birth (other than twins)
the children did not live.

WIFE: “ Herbert , what does this mean —out

WEEK-ENDERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“VVe urge that our people recognise how great a
menace to Church life what is termed ‘week-ending’
has become.” —Motion agreed to at Melbourne Metho-
dist Synod.
The world is full of evil
The wicked take foe joy ;
All things are in upheaval—
The modern girl and boy
Go gaily, as week-enders,
To beauty-spots and splendors,
Where Nature still engenders
Allurements that destroy.
The Bush is all temptation—
Scents, colors, mocking songs.
And who "can find salvation
Among the Dandenongs!
Tangled in sinful r.ooses
These Pagans make excuses,
Glad that fresh air seduces
Our erstwhile pious throngs.
From church they’re always straying,
At Sunday-school they’re missed ;
What pranks the hoy<s are playing,
And how the girls are kissed !
They seek the Bush and Ocean,
Give way to Youth’s emotion—
This is the direful notion
That shocks the Methodist.
I've known young-lady teachers
Such Pagan picnics plan,
And leave our prayerful preachers,
To hear the pipes of Pan.
I’ve seen the girls canoeing,
And watched their lovers wooing,
When Venus’ doves w’ere cooing—-
This is the Fall of Man.
We must beware these dangers
The wicked-hearted seek ;
To righteousness they’re strangers,
Their want of shame is Greek.
And they’re the worst offenders,
Young folk who go on benders,
And (hoose, the damned week-enders,
Such pleasures, w’eek by week !

“Patsy Harrison”: I reckon Dick Taylor,
of Mount Morgan, had as close a call as any man.
He fell down a shaft .oft. deep in the big mine
and afterwards walked down the hill and home.
He was a bit stunned, so I helped him over the
rough places. That was years ago, and he is still
as much alive as you and I.
* * * *
“Spadger” : The queer thing “Hawk” (B.
20/10/’2l) dug out of a burrow is merely a young
fox. The younger you get them the bluer and more
furry they are. It is only after about four weeks
that the animal begins to assume his normal reddish
color, and for some time after that his tail is thin
like a dog’s. I dug out two dens one day and
bagged three little blue chaps and two older red
ones, kept one of each color and fed bluey out of
a bottle for the first couple of weeks. When they
were half-grown I made a dug-out for them in the
hillside and chained ’em up like dogs. But they
got too clever at snapping up all the fowls, that
came within reach, and I had to convert their skins
into a ten-\job note.
* * * *
“Percy P.”: I have been watching a
little bird-drama. Lothario Spag was a big fellow
of his tribe who sat constantly
near where two other sparrows
were building a nest. He seemed
lonely compared with the twit-
tering pair that were busy over
their home-making, and I was
inclined to pity him until it was
forced upon me that he was a
lazy, selfish brute. When the nest
was almost completed his atten-
tions to Mrs. Spag became marked,
and Mr. Spag, becoming enraged,
attacked him. The little chap
might have had a chance against
his bigger opponent if his faith-
less spouse had not chipped in
on his rival’s behalf and helped
to drive him off. He came back
once or twice, gamely, but found
the proceedings too rough, and
gave it up ; and the interloper
and Mrs. Spag reared a family
in the nest the Lothario had not
helped to make. But when it
came to feeding the nestlings,
the lazy Lothario found the work
too hard, and disappeared. Two
days later Mrs. Spag had a mate
again, and although I can’t swear
that it was her former husband,
he was the same size. Anyway, he entered
enthusiastically into the work of feeding the off-
spring, so evidently if it is the same he has over-
looked the lapse of his faithless spouse.
* * * *
“Small Bore”: With refei’ence to “Ben-
dee’s” reply to “L.J.D.” in reference to cut cart-
ridges (B. 27/10/’2l) I’d like to say that I have
here a .22 rifle that will out-shoot and kill cleaner
than “Bendee’s” 32.40 Winchester any day in the
week. This gun has a very flat trajectory, its
point-blank range being 350yds. At 1000yds it has
a striking smack of about half a ton. I’ve done
serious business with it with ’roos at long range,
and at all ranges it’s either a clean kill or a clean
miss. The gun shoots a 70gr. bullet with 90gr.
lightning powder, and by comparison any 32.40 is a
mere putty-blower.
“C. 8.”: Re “Paul C.’s” statement about
a black snake swallowing a death-adder (B.
20/10/’2l), I can vouch for a thing like that hap-
pening. About 30 years ago, when I was getting
experience on the A. A. Co.’s Warrah station, I killed
a black snake with a death-adder’s head in his
mouth (the rest of the adder’s body was attached,
of course). I skinned them as they were and
showed the result to Mr. George Fairbairn, then
resident manager of Warrah.
“Gouger”: A travelling showman recently
visited a Queensland bush town, brirgirg a talking
cockatoo that added to the enjoyment of the crowd
outside the tent. As the pleasure-seekers bustled in-
side, the showman would bawl out: “One at a time,
please! One at a time! Where’s your manners!
Give a man a charnce!” Cocky was in his glory
when repeating these words. Next morning the bird
was missing, and the anxious showman, after collect-
THOROUGHBREDS.
“Ours are very choice fowls, too. Do you know we have had them for over six months
and never once got a had egg!”
ing much abuse through peering into sundry back
yards, organised a search-party. We did not have
far to go. A mob of crows, excitedly squawking and
making vicious downward swoops at the butt of a
gum, first drew our attention. Then came a familiar,
screeching voice, but very ragged with fright:
“One at a time, please 1 One at a time! Give a
man a charnce, give a man a charnce!” Cocky
with his back to the gum-tree was having the fight
of his life.

Re “Mud’s” story of the tom-
cat suckling the kitten (B. 13/10/’2l). Gould
and Pyle, in their “Curiosities of Medicine,” quote
Hunter as referring to a man who shared equally
with his wife the suckling of their infants. Accord-
ing to Mehliss, some missionaries in Brazil in the
16th century asserted there was a whole Indian
nation whose women had small and withered breasts,
and whose children were suckled entirely by the
males. Hall exhibited to his class in Baltimore a
negro who had suckled the whole of his mistress’s
family, and Ford quotes the story of a child suckled
by the captain of a ship when its mother died at sea.
* * * *
“F.W.S.”: Tincture of iodine is useless
in the treatment of snakebite (B. 20/10/’2l) ; but
keep a bottle of it handy, nevertheless. Dabbed on
cuts or abrasions it cleanses, kills bacteria, prevents
festering and promotes healing. Next to Epsom
salts, it’s the best thing in the family medicine-
chest.
* * * *
“Ulooloo”: Re “Mud’s” tom-cat (B.
13/10/’2l) who gave suck to kittens. Gynecomastism
(male milk-giving breasts) is well known, and is not
confined to the lower animals. Humboldt found in
South America a solitary settler who, his wife having
died in childbirth, had despairingly placed the infant
on his own breast, and the continued stimulus of
the child’s sucking movements had caused the dor-
mant mammary glands to become active. Haeckel
saw a young Cingalese, in his 25th year, who had
large breasts that gave plenty of milk, and was em-
ployed as a “male nurse” to suckle a new-born infant
whose mother had died at its birth.
* * * *
“H.V.E.”: “Country Ped’s” green leek (B.
27/10/’2l) is the musk lorikeet ( Glossopsittacus con-
cinnus), which bears that trivial name in common with
the superb parrot ( Poly tells barrabandi). But the
color of the musk lorikeet is not “leek” or bluish-
green in parts as that of the superb parrot is, and
therefore the name “green leek” doesn’t quite fit
this bird either. On the N.S.W. South Coast the
musk lorikeet appears in flocks during summer, when
the honeysuckles and some of the gum-trees are in
blossom, and has a royal time. The superb parrot,
on the other hand, is decidedly rare, and keeps, I
think, chiefly to the great forests. It occurs also,
but sparsely, on the Monaro highlands. A small
relative of the musk lorikeet, the purple-crowned
lorikeet ( Glossopsittacus porphyrocephaius) , also
visits the South Coast aforesaid. These are the
noisy little birds that shoot through the air with
shrill cries, like so many aerial torpedoes. Another
casual visitor is the Swift parrot ( Euphema discolor),
which clings in festoons to the tall stems of the
grass-tree when the seeds are brown ripe, enshroud-
ing them in vivid color.
“Aragun”: A mate and I were fishirig-
in the Clarence when about sft. of black snake (red-
bellied variety) swam past the boat. He dodged
the whack aimed at him, and dived, heading for the
shore. We pulled after him and managed to knock
him out on the bank as he landed. A 50 and a 20
yards line tied together fell about six feet short of
the distance between the snag he started from and
his finishing point. This isn’t a lie. Is it a record?
“King King”: In drought-time in Queens-
land, and in Western. N. S. Wales, I have often seen
dingoes fishing for crayfish. Their plan when after
a fish is to get between it and the deep water and
gradually work it into water too shallow to swim
in. Then the fish is caught with a quick snap,
carried on shore and eaten.
* * * *
“Ophis” : “Jackeroo” (B. 27/10/’2I) states
that at Balonne River (Q.) hundreds of turtles can
be seen leaving the water and making inland. Pro-
bably, as he suggests, they are fed up with Queensland,
but if not I think I can give a passable explanation.
“Jackeroo” would, I think, find that they belong
to the gentler sex, the males remaining in the stream
while the females make their annual pilgrimage to
search for small ponds or swamps well away from
flood levels, so that their eggs may hatch out undis-
turbed. When they have found a favorable spot, they
dig or burrow themselves into the mud and debris
and lay their eggs, a job which might take a week
or so. Their duty performed, they raise themselves
THERE WAS LIFE IN THE OLD
MAN YET.

suppose you’ve lived here all your

ZIFF : “No—not yet.”
from the mud, see that the eggs are well covered,
and straightway make their return journey to the
river or stream from which they came. Turtles
have been known to cover over a mile in search
of a favorable egg-laying ground.

DIMITRI’S LOVE AFFAIR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dimitri run da oyster-shop an’ make da joint to pay,
But when he get da love affair da profit fall away ;
It cost seex plate, one ruined lobst’, five dozen oyst',
a chair,
An’ twelve-an’-seex an’ two black eye’, Dimitri’s
love affair.
He get da love for pretty Liz, so round and tend’
and sof’,
With hair jus’ like a horse’s tail and eyes like cups
of coff’ ;
And when she see he “gone” she beg for present
every week,
Da bott’ of oyst’ or piece of feesh —by kri’, he
foolish Greek!
He give her every t’irg like lamb —who tink she play
him treecks ?—■
And write it off in ledg’ as “Love”: it come to
twelve-an’-secx.
And den da dreadful crash it come! He stand at
door one day,
An’ see da pretty charmer walk wit’ sailor down
his way.
He roll da eye an’ smile an’ bow; she stare and
mutter “Brute!”
And sailor growl, “ ’Ere, cut that out, yer grinnin’
Dago coot!”
Dimitri joomp six feet in air and den he get da
mood ;
He kick da cat and stab da lobst’ and quarrel wit’
da food,
Den go an’ sit among da feesh, an’ brood an’ brood
an’ brood!:
Den say quite calm, “I fight not girl” (his big dark
eye go moist),
“I simply wait and catch dat sail’, and kill him —
wit’ da oyst’!”
THE MATERIALIST.
BLOKE: “Crumbs, if this bubonic gets ’old
of yer, y’aint got much chance!”
PARSON: “My friend, if you have a clear
conscience there’s nothing to fear.”
BLOKE: “Oh, rats!”
An’ ver’ nex’ night he get him. Da sailor, ripe for
row,
Come in, mooch drunk, an’ roar for oyst’. Dimitri
smile and bow:
“Yiss, sare, an’ t’ank you verry mooch!”—for ver’
polite da Greek —
And serve him wit’ da perished oyst’, been dead for
fourteen week!
Da drunken sail’ he grab da oyst’ and eat dem for
his life;
Dimitri watch with gloating eyes and fingers on his
knife,
Den nearly swoon, for sail’ not die —he smack da
lips and snort:
“ ’Ere, bring us more!—the best dam’ oyst’ I ever
taste, ole sport!”
Wit’ trembling legs Dimitri lan, dat scarce could
feel da floor ;
Da sail’ eat t’ree move dozen corpse’, an’ still he
yell for more.
He got da stum’ like leath’, I t’ink! Dimitri pant
an’ run,
And had to bring good oyst’ at last —da perished
kind all done!
An’ den da climax burst. Da sail’ rise up an’ yell:
“You cow !
’Ere, wot in blanky blinking blank you’ puttin' on
me now ?
These oyst’ is stale! Why can’t you bring the kind
I had before?
The sort with that full-flavored taste. You fraud,
I’ll punch yer jore!”
Da fight it start in right away, but sailor not play
fair —
He take Dimitri’s knife away an’ hit him wit' da
chair,
An’ black his eyes, punch nose, smash plate, while
feesh all round he fling—
Den t’row da lobster in his face an’ go outside an’
sing.
An’ now Dimitri sits an’ t’inks, but not of pretty
Liz.
His t’oughts is on da profits—da damage to da biz,
An’ work da sum —how long it take to make da
leeway up
By giving one oyst’ less each plate when drunks
come in to supp’;
Den groan an’ cheek da till again, an’ shake da
head, an’ swear,
An’ say, “Perhaps in t'irteen month’ —oh-h-h, damn

No doubt the heaviest taxation of all is ill-health. Yet it is the only one
you can avoid; easily, too, simply by cultivating an outdoor hobby,
gardening, golf or such like, and by taking an occasional dose of
CLEMENTS TONIC whenever you feel “off color” CLEMENTS TONIC
is an excellent blood and nerve medicine —still popular after thirty years.
Clements Tonic, Limited, Rozelle, N.S.'W.
‘ F.C.L.” : We had a wedding in our dis-
trict (W.Q.) recently—a young drover and a cocky’s
daughter. Some little pressure had teen brought
to bear upon the groom, but the ceremony went off
all right—priest, best man, bridesmaid and every-
thing. ‘‘There,” said his riverence, at the end,
“you’re as much married as I can make you.” The’
bride giggled, but the ’groom’s face retained a
stonewall blankness. The best man then took a
turn. He wrung the ’groom’s hand. “Bill, old
chap,” he said, “all I can say is I wish I was in
yer place.” Bill looked at him so’emnly for a
minute, then said “I wish ter Gawd yer was!”
‘‘B.W.L.” ; “J.M.R.” can’t top the poll
with his 25-year-old rosella. There has just died
at Cowel-street, West Perth, a white cockatoo aged
31 years. He was an immigrant brought from
Newport (Vic.) 20 years ago.
“YVandi”: The piccaninny had its doll
just the same as the white youngster, and played
‘mothers’’ and “parties” with it in similar fashion.
One doll that I saw a black girl nursing was a thin
straight stick with a few dabs of red and white
pigment on it, and a piece of ’possum-fur gummed
on one end. A doll that represented Dad Bin°-hi
was a knobby stick, decorated with a miniature
tabby, or loin-cloth.
* * * #
“Mirza”: I advise “Black Bonnet” (B.
22/1 0 /’2i) to place very little reliance on tincture
ot iodine as a snake-bite “cure,” and to be ve-y
careful in administering it internally. In such doses
as the man from the North” gave the cat, viz,, 40
drops in less than seven hours, it would be extremely
dangerous. Admittedly under certain circumstances,
such as shock or great pain, the patient will tolerate
much larger quantities of drugs than usual (the
writer, though quite unused to the hypnotic, re-
cently took three grains of morphia in 24 hours
without any noticeable effect), but iodine poisoning
might easily enough occur. Despite the prohibi-
tionists, whisky is the best internal remedy known
to science for treating snakebite; but prompt and
efficient ligation, scarification or excision, promo
Don of the bleeding, the rubbing in of potassium
permanganate and stimulation of ihe heart witii
alcohol are the steps in modern rural treatment. If
obtainable, give the correct anti-venin.
“Alex”: “Jimsey” (B. 3/11/’2l) is
scratching his head over flea-bite swellings. Never
mind any other remedies: tell him just to leave a
heel-tap of rum in the bottle and pour it on the
punctures.
* * * A
“Tin Hat”: “Jim Carew” asks (B.
20/10/’2l) about the behavior of a platypus on
finding himself hooked. The only specimen 1 have
caught acted in the same way as the one mentioned
by J.C., i.('. , it grabbed the bait (worm) and
fled downstream at top speed. After a ton of
Double (I was fishing from the Goulburn yvei r into
the race below the floodgates and on a pitch-black
night), 1 landed the queer little fellow, and, sub-
limely ignorant of the risk, held him under mv arm
while I removed the hook. Later, from a man with
his arm in a sling I learnt that 1 had been lucky
enough to handle the harmless female of the species,
the old man being furnished with a pair of poisoned
spurs on his hind legs and a vicious knack of
locking them into the hand of the unwary. The
authority referred to informed me that he was yvear-
ing his hand in the sling as a result of catching
an old-man platypus five months previously, six
weeks of the interval being spent in hospital.
PROOF OF IT.
“He very old dog that feller.”
“Why, he looks a pup.”
“No fear! Close up hundred years old that
feller —horn oo-bout last Christmas.”
“S.M.W.” : Re the G.unning “golden
eagle” (B. 27/10/21). This bird was probably a
large specimen of our common wedgetail eagle,
which also has a rich golden-brown head and neck.
It is the largest eagle known —larger than the
golden eagle (beak to tail) and the American eagle.
But they are really all equivalent birds, or local
variations. In the same way our white-bellied sea-
cagle is the same as the American bald-head.
‘Friday Island”: “Jimsey’s” kid (B.
3/11/’2l) who suffers acutely after flea-bite lacks
an immunity in his blood to flea-bite toxin. Which
proves that ‘■Jimsey’s” ancestors lived in clean, flea-
less surroundings. An artificial immunity might be
set up by letting loose on the kid a swarm of fleas
caught and saved up for the Great Offensive. The
NO OFFENCE.
VERY BLITHERED ( sentimentally ) : “ Don't talk li' that about women, Ted—shink of yer
own shislers!”
NEARLY AS BLITHERED: “ Can't shink of my shisters. Never ’ad no shisters.”
VERY BLITHERED: “Well, shink of the shisters you might ’ave ’ad if yer mother ’ad
married.”
kid would have particular Hades for a week, but
would probably be immune to unpleasantness from
sporadic flea-bites afterwards. The only danger
with this scientific immunisation would be the
possibility of introducing- erysipelas or other sepsis.
Meantime, as a prophylactic, lightly dust the cloth-
ing with insect powder, or apply a solution o f
chrysanthemum seed in alcohol, or wash with spirits
of menthol and thymol. If despite these pre-
cautions fleas still alight on the kid and bite
him, wash the bites with cloudy ammonia to neu-
tralise the acid toxin, and then paint with an evapo-
rating skin-varnish, compounded of ichthyol one
drachm and collodion flexile seven drachms. Obtain-
able from any chemist.
“Robert”: A etvo up in the Mallee (Vie.)
lately presented six youngsters at once to her sur-
prised owner. Cocky reckons this is a record. But
he has a photo of the dame and her family which
is even more remarkable than the actual happening.
It shows the ewe and six lambs standing in a
perfectly even rank —no seven soldiers coukl do it
better —eyes to front, heads erect, legs in line; all
at attention, as it were, each sheep being so like
every other that it is difficult to believe such a photo
was possible. Of course, it was a freak snap; a
dog had given the sheep a start.
“Pioneer”: A recent correspondent’s sug-
gestion that the sheep-drafting swing-gate was the
invention 01 Mr. Hungerford, of Walgett, is an
error, I think; anyhow, Lockhart Morton, founder
of Morton Plains station, in the Wimmera district
of Victoria, is credited by old Victorians with the
invention, and it was in use there probably before
sheep reached Walgett. As no improvement has
been effected on the principle of the swing-gate
since the first was hung, and as its use has been
of inestimable value, is it not singular that any
doubt should remain as to the identity of such a
benefactor ?
* * * *
“Airey”: Re “Jim Carew’s” par. (B.
27/10/’2l) on the method employed by spurwing
plovers in transporting their young across water.
They don’t. The chickens transport themselves by
swimming. I was lately driving sheep along the
edge of a swamp, and saw four young plovers
forced by the mob into the water. They acquitted
themselves as well as a duckling : —even better a-s
far as speed was concerned. Yet I’ve never seen
the old birds swimming.
“Ophis” : “Truthful James”(B. 27/10/’2l)
asserts that snakes do not swall'ow their young, but
receive them into a sac which is concealed under
and outside the lower jaw, and which can only be
detected by the most careful dissection. This takes
the prize as an original story to put up on Abos. 1
have looked up the works of several professors who
have written on. the myology and anatomy of snakes,
and can find no reference to any such sac; and I
have personally made many careful dissections, and
have found no trace of the alleged receptacle. I
have taken pains to search out some of the latest
literature on snakes, and have found that even
among scientists there is a diversity of opinion as
to whether snakes swallow their young or give them
a safe refuge somewhere down south, or whether it
is pure fiction. Some reliable observers have stated
that they have seen a rattlesnake open her mouth
while the youngsters crawled in, and have waited
behind cover until they appeared again. The subject
is certainly interesting, and the weight of .evidence,
as far as I can make out, is towards the theory that
snakes, or some snakes, do allow their young to take
refuge in their throats. Very often black snakes
aTe cut open, and many living young arfe found;
but in cases such as these careful observers may note
that the young are in the oviducts awaiting birth,
and not in the alimentary tract.
“Jim Garew”: “Goodie” (B. 3/11/’2l)
asks if any Abo. has ever seen a black snake mea-
suring more than 34 inches. In 1903 Barney Holds-
worth and I killed one at Yowrie, near Cobargo,
N.S.W. South Coast, which measured 7ft. 4iin. I
took the addresses of three men (certainly one of
them’s a .T.P.) who were present when we measured
the streak of infamy'. ;
“Managi Noehara”: The traders of the
Solomons in the old days (I was one of ’em) could
tell you of the maiden trip of the Tamako from
Vella Vella, when she left, manned by 60 bucks, to
raid Choiseul. Built with towering stem and stern,
she was ornamented with a gruesome, grinning
human head both fore and aft. And if you caught
them returning, as we did on more than one occa-
sion, and ran them to earth on the beach, it wasn’t
nice to lift the cocoanut leaves in the bottom of
the canoe, as under these were stowed next week’s
tucker in the shape of half-cooked humans. Kill?
Of course they would kill. Jn any and every
occasion. Old Ingava, the . chief of Ruviana Lagoon,
explained it Jo me this way. “When one black man
sees another, his first thought is ‘He is going to
kill me,’ ;and the second thought, ‘Can I kill him ?’ ”
That’s the whole thing boiled down. They lived or
died by killing or being killed. And they throve
on it. They multiplied in spite of it. They grew
hard. They had strict tribal laws. They were a
clean, healthy race of people. And then came civili-
sation. The most perfect and beautiful law ever
framed was that of the Eastern Solomons’ law of
kamer, to prevent inter-marriage. And the most
marvellous part about it was that, though there were
no records or writings, the ancestry of each male
and female was known for generations back. The
children were exchanged into villages where they
would marry people of no blood relation. Thus did
the Malaita man preserve the number, stature and
intellect of his tribe. Enter the' well-meaning mis-
sionary, mostly a young man who would consider it
unbecoming to discuss or have a knowledge of
natural law. He wouldn’t dream of talking the
matter over with the “old men”—heathens from
his point of view. Pie forgot about the inter-
breeding part of it, and married the “boys” and
gills of his mission-school—irrespective of
kamer. Sometimes he got away. Sometimes
he was another “martyr.”' The “boy” and
“girl” also got it in the neck. Often they
would hide in the bush until a Queensland labor
vessel put in, and ship for the plantations. Some
of ’em stayed away for years, until, when the
Queensland Government started white-washing Aus-
tralia, they were forced to return—and they” found
it waiting for them. I know. I landed hundreds of
’em.

Snell : Pringle and Brown dammed up
the creek at Python Flat, rigged a couple of hundred
feet of fluming, and started to put the big green hill
that was long ago the Python tip through the sluice
box. They expected nothing more than a bare living,
but in the second week Pringle struck a patch. It
was on first sight a gleaming trifle clinging to a
scrap of root. Throwing the root aside, and examin-
ing the glittering object more closely, Pringle per-
ceived that the firm had come into possession of a
very fine diamond and emerald ring which turned
out to be worth nearly £2OO. The supposed scrap
of loot to which the ring was clinging proved to be
the little finger of a man, and, later, they unearthed
the rest of the remains. Although not making
tucker Brown and Pringle put through the last bar-
row-load of the tip. “We thought he might ha’ had
a tie-pin,” said Pringle gloomily.
“Jim C.”: “Delhi” (B. 3/11/’2l) asks
why ticks never tackle pigs. But I know of cases
on the N.S.W. South Coast and on the Hawkesbury
where ticks have been found in pigs; and rightlv
or wrongly the death of one valuable young boar
was ascribed to them.
* * *
“Pick”: “Vandorian’s” remarks (B.
13/10/’2l> on the longevity of birds recall that
some years ago records compiled by French savants
established that condors and vultures had
lived upwards of 150 years. The researches led to
the conclusion that birds, having instead of teeth
an inward grinding apparatus that sufficiently mas-
ticates every particle of food swallowed, are never
addicted to indigestion, and thus excrete readily and
do not carry for long periods a natural breeding-
ground for life-destroying germs.
* * * *
“Barcoo” : Recently on the banks of the
Thompson (C.Q.) was unearthed, on fhe site of
what had been a very ancient blackfellows’ perma-
nent camping-ground, the whole outfit of one of
their mills for grinding nardoo into flour. It con-
sisted of only two parts—the cradle or trough and
the pestle or grinding-instrument. Both were sand-
stone. The mill, was portable though somewhat un-
wieldy, weighing nearly 951 b. The grinder or pestle
had the shape of a rude axe, the head of which
fitted into the concave groove; it was pushed back-
wards and forwards through the hollowed portion,
the operator grasping the sandstone handle that ran
back from the head of the implement. Evidently
only one hard was usually employed—Binghi never
used two hands if he could make one do. The
nardoo seeds were gradually fed into the trough
and ground or pulverised, after ■which the tough
brown covering of the seeds was more or less care-
fully separated from the dull muddy-colored meal.
There was nothing tempting to the palate in the
resultant johnny-cake.

A Plain
Fact!
called the Tyro, a Tyro being, in his special
sense of the word, a Freudian monster, a
e o rt of elemental man whose desires have
not yet been suppressed. There were Tyros
everywhere on the wall A Tyro about to
breakfast,” “Mr. Wyndham Lewis as
“Tyros reading Ovid”—caricatures of
humanity, but harmless-looking enough de-
spite their gigantic teeth, mahogany flesh
and gluttonous grins. Lewis is an able man ;
but in his pictorial art he is far from being
a Hogarth.
The battle still rages between Futurists
and Pastists. In art criticism words are
often so vaguely used that even Augustus
John has been called a Futurist, as
Whistler used to be described, quite wrongly,
as an Impressionist. John’s own words,
after his election as an A.R.A., are clear
and to the point. “The only thing that sur-
prises me is that I was not elected years
ago, for I really am the most academical and
traditional of all modern painters. I simply
worship tradition. I have no use at all
for the people who work in zig-zags and
cubes, in curves and triangles. Down with
all your Tyros, say I. No, the young Johns
of the future must not expect me to be kind
to them. They ought to be stifled at birth,
as I should have been.”
LOUIS ESSON.
John Murray and his Men
Among the London publishers the name of
John Murray stands by itself. In 1708 a
young lieutenant in the Royal Navy threw
up his commission and started to publish
books. That was six years before the Ameri-
can colonists in the 13 provinces took on
themselves the title of the United States of
America. This John Murray the first was
a Scotsman and he “made good” even in
those days, when to have a birthplace north
of the Tweed was very nearly a hang-
ing matter in London. To him succeeded
the second of the name, known to all men
as the publisher of Lord Byron and many
another; and he was followed by the third
John Murray, and he by the fourth, who is
now the chairman, in his 70th year, of John
Murray, Ltd. The long line of hereditary
publishers is not yet broken, for there is upon
the Board yet another John Murray Ohe
fifth), who took the command of the 12th
Battalion of the Royal Scots in the recent
war, and brought back the D.S.O. and bar to
present to his recently-married wife, the
youngest daughter of the first Lord Brassey.
Recently the firm has swallowed the
wreckage of Smith, Elder and Co., and has
taken over, to set beside their own Quar-
terly Review, the Corn hill Magazine,
once edited by Thackeray (who said of it
that “the cushions of the editorial chair were
stuffed With thorns”), and now conducted by
one of the sons of T. 11. Huxley, who stayed
some time in Australia before he gained fame
by “abolishing God.” Take a look first at
the list of the older authors who were content
to appear under the Murray countersign—
Darwin, Disraeli, Robert Browning and his
wife, A. C. Benson (whose autobiography is
now in its 21st impression), David Living-
stone, George Borrow, the Brontes, etc., and
many another who has “done something”—
and then at a bundle of their latest publica-
tions, to see how the tradition has been main-
tained.
“A Few Short Runs” is by Lord Harris, one
of the very few remaining of the old school
of amateur cricketers who remember “Felix”
and have conversed with the Hambledon
players in the days when that little Hamp-
shire village could play All England. His
name always sounded gruesome to my schoolboy
ears until I learnt how his great-grandfather
won the barony in Southern India and the
right to annex “of Seringapatam and My-
sore,” not .so very far from the district where
the revolt is now afoot. It was in the Eton
and Harrow match at Lord’s that Harris
was’ in with C. I. Thornton and the latter
hit the ball clean over the top of the pavilion,
a feat that has never been done since. He
chats a Way over those days of derring-do and
his own reminiscences of the game in South
Africa, North America, India, etc., until one
almost forgets that he was sent as Governor
to Bombay in the early ’nineties.
The third Marquess of Bute “went West”
just 20 years ago, and his life was a typical
one. He was fifteenth in descent from Robert
11. of Scotland, and the holder of. 10 other
titles in the peerage of Great Britain. The
third earl was “unquestionably the most un-
popular Prime Minister who ever held office
in England,” in the days of “Farmer” George
111. but the family held what they had got
and added to it by marriages, till the head was
raised to be Marquess of Bute. The second
Marquess redoubled his fortunes and fore-
saw the future of Cardiff as a seaport. He
had no offspring by his first wife, but just
before he died his second wife presented him
with an heir, who was six months old when
he succeeded to his titles and what was at
that time reputed to be the largest property
on earth. He was brought up by his women
relatives, wrote the English Prize Poem at
Harrow at 15J, went to Christ Church, Ox-
ford, and then suddenly ’verted to Roman
Catholicism. Disraeli took him as the hero
of his novel “Lothair,” and, as usual, made
him out a youthful millionaire with every-
thing before him. He was clever, deeply
read in mediaeval Church lore, spent money
like water on architecture (mostly quite use-
less), and gave abundantly to all sorts of
causes, including the Roman Catholic. He
cordially disliked his prominent position, and
would have been much happier as a plain
Mister with a few hundred a year. His life
is written 20 years after its termination,
with all due reverence, by the Right Rev. Sir
David Blair, Bart., 0.5.8. One of the
blessings of the War is the taxation up to
the hilt of all such unearned fortunes.
One expects to be impressed by Sir Guy
Fleetwood Wilson’s autobiographical “Let-
ters to Nobody, 190 S-1913,” without question-
ing him too closely whether the nobody
was man or woman. For he is one of the
silent people who go where there is real work
to be done and do it without any fuss or
talk. When a man was really required to
set straight the finances in various parts of
our ramshackle Empire, he used to pack up
his traps and set out on the job. In 1007 a
Finance Minister w T as badly wanted in
India, and the lot fell on Sir Fleetwood Wil-
son, who was then 60 years of age and had
never been in Hindustan before. There is
hardly a word about financial affairs in the
book,’ but plenty of big game. In seven
weeks from the time of landing at Calcutta
this man killed a couple of tigers with a
couple of shots in the Sundurbunds, and he
went steadily on, adding to his bag more
tigers, various sorts of bear, buffalo, bison
and deer, not to mention crocodiles and
small game. Really an extraordinary book
to be written by a shikari who relates his
adventures after his sixtieth year!
Time flies so quickly that many who read
this will not have recognised, under the title
of Brigadier-General Frank Maxwell, V.C.,
C. 5.1., D. 5.0., etc., a member of a family
which’ has done so much to plaster with red
the map of the world. He served from 1891 in
the Royal Sussex Regiment, got appointed
to the 24th Punjabis, was recommended for
the V.C. in his first campaign, transferred
again to the 18th Bengal Lancers, saw the
best part of the Boer War as A.D.C. to
Kitchener (it was there he got the V.C.)
went with him in the same position to
India, and was with Lord Ilardinge, first as
A.D.C. and then as Military Secretary. He
was shot in September, 1917, while in
command of an infantry brigade, after the
affairs of Trones and Thiepval, at the age
of 46. He never knew what fear was. Max-
well came over to Australia as Instructing
Officer of Light Horse, bringing with him
his wife —Miss Charlotte Osborne, of Cur-
randooley, N. S. Wales. She has edited
his letters, and capital reading they make.
They shed a great light on the real facts of
recent campaigns, especially on the char-
acter of Kitchener, now so eagerly dis-
cussed. We may learn more of this man
from the free and easy letters of those close
to him than from miles of “special articles
by envenomed pens.
H. H. CHAMPION.
Blue Peter
In any age the faithful story of the devel-
opment of a girl’s mind would have proved
a valuable footnote to history. A boy may
live very far away from the people in the
same street and be almost unaware of the
social currents about him ; but a girl, how-
ever she may build her dream romances, is
part and parcel of her time, and her story
reflects its lights and shadows. In The
Ship that Never Set Sail (Ward Lock) Jean
Curlewis gives us just that glimpse of life
in and about Sydney which might enable
the stranger to know us as we are far better
than a more ambitious novel of our wo: ks
and ways. It is a girl’s book —almost a
child’s book —and the authoress never goes
beyond the range of her own knowledge.
Once, in a highly-colored romance which
Brenda meets in the giddy whirl of the
White City, the even tnread is broken by
an unlikely incident; but all the rest is
simply and quietly convincing.
Brenda is a girl who drinks in from her
earliest years the spirit of Sydney Harbor.
Ships and sea adventure form the . back-
ground of all her thought. When she is free
from her school tasks she immediately be-
comes Blue Peter, part-owner of the tramp
steamer Crown of Galicia, and visits in
fancy every port of the world. Her smug-
gler’s cave high up in the rocks is reached
by a dangerous climb of 60 feet; and here
Mr. Brown, from next door at Mosman,
discovers her. Brown is a middle-aged clerk
with a mother and two sisters to support
who has the sea-ache in his blood. He dis-
covers his mother when the old lady sud-
denly wakes up and throws a knife with the
.skill of a pirate—she has had her sea adven-
ture and dreams on in a wild past while her
tired son builds mental pictures of an im-
possible future from shipping lists and long
loiterings by Pyrmont Bridge.
The little events chase one another inter-
estingly through the pages. There is good
atmosphere and here and there a touch of
humor, but the color is faint and delicate
and the happenings have little boldness of
outline. Brenda’s romance of the sea fades
off into a love affair of a quiet sort that
finds its inspiration in the well-disciplined
ambition of a boy to serve the world. The
ship never sails;' the bold Blue Peter be-
comes a gentle little mouse in fluffy bridal
garments: and the bells ring with a per-
fectly respectable conventional note in their
faint golden tones.
There is a great deal more real promise in
this little volume than in much that may be
more loudly acclaimed. Judged as a first book,
it has the outstanding merit that so many of
its kind lack —it rings true all the way.
That is a good foundation to build upon;
and while its present popularity must de-
pend almost entirely upon its appeal to girls
like Brenda, it is not altogether a mere gift
book. The Mr. Browns will find a thrill
there also; and the characterisation and
easy descriptions may well be the first show-
ing of an ability to write fiction of a larger
kind. Of minor faults a rather painfully
frequent use of “like” for “as” may be noted.
Even in the conversation m the Professor’s
family circle there should be a _ moderate
regard for grammatical construction. But
the writing is in the main singularly lucid,
simple and free from affectation. Some day
the epic of Sydney Harbor may be written;
and this may be the prelude to the grander
song.

A Satchel of Books
The Darn, by Edward Lewis (George Allen and
Unwin). It tells how an English village which has
been brought to religion by the ministrations of the
lady of the manor reacts to the arrival of an agnostic.
A grim story told with a wonderful 1 attention to
psychological detail.
The Thirteen Travellers, by Hugh Walpole (Hutch-
inson). A series of short character sketches, bald
and even banal in instances, but written in an
appealingly simple style.
No Clue, by James Hay, junior (Dodd, Mead and
Co., per Whitcombe and Tombs). Slick U.S. detec-
tive story, with a satisfactory murder and an in-
gratiating sleuth. A book that will please some N. S.
Wales employers; for the bluggy deed is sheeted
home to a .Judge;.
The Secret of the Sandhills, by Arthur Gaslc
(Rigbv, Adelaide). An eighteenpenny booklet of
the class made familiar to Australians by the N.S.W.
Bookstall Co. There is plenty of action in it. The
hero is, of course, extra-heroic and wir.s all conij eti-
tions—including the Matrimonial Stakes. But that s
the sort it is.
Between the Flags, by “Sabretache” (Odham’s).
Readable sporting yarn bv an English horse-reporter*
of repute. The hero, an" amiable young scapegrace,
rides the winner and marries the right girl after
uncle, an amateur detective of sorts, has foiled the
designs of the gay lady from Jo’bui'g- And she
wasn’t a bad sort, after all.
Horace and the Bird, by Robert A. Hamblin
(George Allen and Unwin). A humorous yarn of
shabby-genteel life in and around London by the
gentle humorist who wrote “Ann’s First Flutter.
The comedy in this book is much more restrained
than in anything Hamblin has done hitherto, and
an ingeniously complicated plot surroui ds the move-
ments of the Bird —which is a cuckoo clock.
Vera, bv the authoress of “Elizabeth and Her Ger-
man Garden” (Macmillan). The central figure is
again one of those husbands whom the lady draws
with such ruthless humor. Nominally Everard Wemyss
is an English stockbroker; actually he is pure
Boche. In point of fact, he is the husband of “The
Caravanners” grown older and more objectionable.
The late war may have something to do with the
new note of tragedy that comes into this brilliant
story, as it did into “Christopher and Columbus,
its immediate predecessor.
A Philosopher with Nature, by Benjamin Kidd
(Methuen). A collection of essays which the late
author probably did not intend should see the light.
Of hares he observes: “There is no more remark-
able type in nature than that of the hare when it
is considered in relation to its specialisation foi
speed” ; and there is much more which is equally
obvious concerning bees, frogs and so forth. Still,
there is a charm about the book due to the writer’s
clear style and abounding interest in every living
thing.
U;i Against It, by Varick Vanardy (the Macaulay
Co., N. York). This was doomed to be the basis of
a cinema scenario from the moment it left its
maker’s hands. The hero is one of those Canadian
North-West supermen, who is troubled with violent
emotions. “His face had gore white, his jaws were
set and his eyes were hard. They glittered with the
utter cold of restrained anger. , ’ That is the kind
of thing that happens to Dan Randall several times
a day. There is a lot of tearing about in snow-
storms, and the warring factions continually miss
each other in the confusion, and so serve the cause
of romance.

The Oil Seekers, by Jack McLaren (N.S.W. Book-
stall Co.). A tale of an oil-hunt in Papua by a
writer whose craftsmanship grows with every novel.
The plot is not more exciting than usual, and the
love-making runs the customary course of coolness
and misunderstanding to a demonstrative canoodle
in the final chapter, but the story is very readable
for the author’s knowledge of the niggers who play
the part of supers in his South Sea dramas and
his scene-painting is attractive.
The Inky Way
SPACE.
[Fob The Bulletin.]
I learnt when young ot' Space and Time,
As philosophic themes sublime;
But later when I came to write,
I found that Space was concrete, quite—
A realm with lure of cash in view
Ruled by a czar with pencil blue.
Filled high with hope, as youngsters are,
I started in to fight that czar.
To lengthy screeds my faith I pinned:
He cut their stummicks out and grinned.
My' verse grew long with padded “tripe”!
He put ’em into smaller type.
My jokes were dwarfed, my stories shorn,
The trimming from my pars was torn.
So when my r hopes on quids I’d fix
He’d cut me down to threc-an’-six.
But now, an ancient hack of verse,
I rise ar.d prophesy this curse:
When He —that reptile warped, the Sub-
Dies quietly at his bowling club,
May he on reaching Heaven’s gate
Find a Blue-Pencil Angel-Fate,
Who’ll say, “You’re ripe, no doubt, for Grace,
But —er —we’re rather pressed for space ;
“And so to you, who lordly posed,
Our (jasper) columns must be closed.
“But down below, just round the turn,
There’s Nick’s Red Page, with space to burn!’’
And Satan, while free-lances yell,
Accepts that sub (“with thanks”) in H—11! ’

“Gila”: “F. Born” (B. 27/10/’2l) asks
whether any reader of The Bulletin has
come across a thieving Celestial. I haven’t
in Australia; but if “F. 8.” is looking for
Chows who are that way inclined, and who,
if thwarted, use sawn-off shotguns as per-
suaders, he will find plenty in the Malay
Peninsula. Their pet pastime is raiding
villages and firing them afterwards. The
gaols and gaol cemeteries are full of them,
and they are of all sorts.

“Graeme”: A Melbourne man bought
£250 worth of furniture from a leading t.-p.
firm, paying £5O as deposit. When he got
the account and found £25 added as “accom-
modation on £250” he kicked, but was told
that “10 per cent, is charged for accommoda-
tion on the full amount of all accounts unless
at least a quarter of the amount is paid in
cash.” So he is parting £5 as interest on
£5O which he paid in cash. Still it’s a
perfectly legal form of robbery. A lawyer
charged him 10s. Gd. for telling him so.
“O. Blin”: An unruly country pub has
become as quiet as a church since a burly
Digger took it over. Billjim has weeded
out the disturbers and doubled his business
by his frank and fearless diplomacy on all
occasions. At closing-time his methods are
Chesterfieldian. lie emerges from behind
the bar, rolls his sleeves up to his bicens,
and remarks quietly to the laggards:
“Gentlemen, there are two ways of leaving
this pub. May I suggest that walking’s the
easiest ir” The kindly advice is never dis-
puted now'. v
“Monaro”: The best system of “bush
telegraphs” I’ve known operated in a Vic.
township. -Call it Beeralia. At Nikola, 15
miles away, was a wineshop that naturally
did its best business on Sunday. The Beer-
alia John who looked after the district’s
morals was a regular snorter, but he was
circumvented. On Sundays two Nikola lads
with bikes were told oft' to go to Beeralia
and shadow the police. Any move was
carefully noted, and, as soon as it was seen
that Nikola was the objective, the cyclists
turned down the next, road apd flew. When
the police arrived an hour or so later the
dank, adhesive somnolence of Nikola had an
air of permanency like Wilson’s Promon-
tory.

South Aus. proposes to put a tax on bulls ;
not to discourage the keeping of them, or
yet for the raising of revenue, but, as Pas-
coe, Minister of Agriculture, told the Assem-
bly, “if an owner has to pay 10s. a year for
a bull, he may decide that it will be just as
well to Spend the money on a (rood animal as
on a bad one.” Governor Weigall, as a
visiting expert, has so rubbed in the local
mistake of breeding from mongrel bulls that
owners of good ones are now to be subsi-
dised. The -Governor has said nothing
stronger than Paseoe himself told Parlia-
ment: “Dairying in S.A. as it stands at
present must be regarded as a rank failure
and something for us to be ashamed of. The
average yield of each dairy cow is only about
one-third of what it ought to be.”

“D. ’ on the struggle for a crust:—
A most effective method of making a bit on the
side, as the three-card men put it, is the shilling
deposit device in connection with the purchase of a
weekly ticket fpr the Manly-Sydney ferrv service.
The ticket nominally half-a-erown ; but the
birs ei pays os. 6d., the shilling being forfeit unless
the ticket is renewed or handed back the Monday
after it has been issued. It is a flimsy scrap of
caidboaid which is as easy to mislay as a tram
ticket. If mislaid and found and used by someone
else it is not going to cost the co. anything, since
the rightful owner has to- immediately begin paving
his way at the turnstiles. Nine times out of ten, ol
course, it would not be so used. The co.’s
revenue from these forfeited bobs is considerable, if
many passengers are built like myself. In my case
about two tickets in five are dragged from the
pocket with handkerchiefs, jettisoned with tram-
tickets, thrown out by my family, or otherwise
abandoned before their time. The inducement to
buy them is not a question of economy: it is a
matter of the difficulty of finding change and push-
ing through primitive turnstiles twice a day. The
only thing that puzzles me is why the astute man-
agement doesn’t make the turnstiles a shade: narrower, •
employ an even more languid lot of lads in the
change-giving boxes, and then raise the penalty for
losing- the 12-a:farthing discs to two bob.

I sleep in a tent that is twelve-by-ten,
And the walls are five-feet-three,
And above my head in glaring red
Is “N.S.W.G.”
The quilt has a brand that is woven in
With a kind of a crimson thread.
The sheets have a crown and “1.C.Y.,”
And there’s “No. 9” on the bed.
The posts of the fence around my tent
Weife hewn from a red gum-tree,
' And clearly stamped where the rails are clamped
Are the letters “M.1.T.”
There are arrow-heads on the tools 1 use,
On the shovel and pick and tine;
And on the tag of my water-bag
Is a hundred and forty-nine.
There’s a station brand on my horse’s rump
And a number hard to see;
There's the brand of the place where he was bred,
And “P. and W.D.”;
There’s a couple -of numbers on his neck,
Theii the crown and small “1.C.,”
And burnt out neat on his two front feet
Is a hundred and twenty-three.
There’s a rising sun on my letterhead,
And a bird with a curving beak,
And close at hand there’s the “1.C.” brand;
On the telephone where I speak
There are arrows here and arrows there
IVith the letters “A” and “B” ;
But up to date, I’m pleased to state,
They haven’t branded me.

lie went to the Front from India as a motor-
cyclist, and reached the Armistice with the
rank of major.
The Westralian Government recently fur-
bished up its expensive motor-ship Kangaroo
and loaded it with a so-called trade dele-
gation and other samples of the country’s
produce, consigned to Java. One of the
trade delegates (the gorgeous Scaddan led
them) was a Perth publican; another was
a monumental mason. On the third day of
the voyage the vessel ran out of butter, but
Bung’s presence was a guarantee that it
didn’t run out of beer. And quite a lot of
orders for Perth headstones are expected
from the trusting Javanese.
Graham Berry used to say that in form-
ing a Ministry three strong men were re-
quired. “As for the others,” he would add,
“almost anyone will do, as long as he is a
good supporter.” Berry’s dictum is recalled
by the admission of ex-Minister Tom Living-
ston, in the Vic. Assembly, that as a pri-
vate member he had opposed the embargo
placed by other States on Vic. spuds arriving
in second-hand bags, and as a Minister had
supported it. Berry used to treat minor Min-
isters as so many political under-secretaries.
Perhaps he was wise. It is quite bad
enough to have to stand by two other men
who do things off their own bat. In N. 8.
Wales there are 13 now who have to pretend
that the other 12 can’t possibly make a
mistake.
Th' naivete of a recent week was per-
petrated by General Rosenthal at Young
( N.S.W.) :-
Speaking- to the King and Empire Alliance, he
said the nation was really in great danger. People
to-day did not seem to be as united as they were
during the war, and there was never a time in our
history when a compromise was so urgent as now-.
If people were united during the war it was
because it did not pay anyone to divide them.
In the A.I.F. the attempt would rightly have
been treated as a crime. It is not difficult,
for example, to picture General Rosenthal’s
attitude towards a padre, whatever Ms
denomination, who tried to ruin the Fourth
Division by introducing sectarianism into
it. In short, while the fighting was on
there were no King and Empire Alliances.
The roundsman’s par
It was close on 5 a.m., and John was out with his
first double basketful of vegetables. He saw a
drowsy-looking citizen trying to get into a Collins-
street pub by ringing the bell, knocking at the door
and throwing sand at a window. Smiling beatifi-
eally, J. Chinaman put down his load, squatted on
the bamboo, took out a box of fags, offered one to
the citizen and lighted up. Then he remonstrated
with the man for staying out all night on a “splee '
or “maybe gam’lin’.” The early bird mumbled that
it was “more like betting,’’ and explained that his
wife was staying at the pub, too. “My word, you
get pie,” said John grinning. “Me try.’’ And the
way he made that bell tinkle was a caution. The
door flew open in 20 seconds, and with a “Good morn-
ing and thanks” to John the belated one went inside.
As the heathen moved off with his burden a J. Hop
happened along, “Know him?” he asked. “No,
responded Saffron; “but him all li’.“ “Well,” pro-
ceeded J. Hop, “that’s the man who made you a
whole faet’ry, all on your own, under the Act, d’ye
moind? An’ be the same token he’s been up all
night helpin’ to double the beltin’ tax on the books.
It was Alec Peacock after an all-night sitting in
Vic. Assembly.
“Bilbav” visits a boiling-down skip:—
Memories of Port Said came back to us as we
rowed out to the floating whaling-factory in Jervis
Bay (N.S.W.). The odor was worse than usual, we
were told, as half a whale had broken loose in a
blow on the beach and a tender was' in process of
turning it adrift outside the heads. We waited
till the remains had got a couple of miles off and
scrambled aboard the Loch Tay. She was just
an ordinary-looking 5000-ton tramp. The boiling-
down vats or digesters were on the well-decks, and
on a light deck built level with the top of the vats
the dissecting business was done.
The crew were cutting up six whales. They
would haul up a carcase in pieces weighing up to
three tons, dump the stuff on the deck above the
boilers and toss hundred-weight junks into the
digesters through a manhole at the top. The
digesters have a perforated false bottom on which
the meat rests, and when they are full the man-
holes are clamped down and steam from the main
boilers is turned on. Everything goes in, flesh,
bones, head and tail —but sometimes the jawbones
are kept. When the oil is all steamed out of the
meat it is drained off, the manhole is removed from
the digesters and a man goes in with a shovel as
soon as it is cool enough. His job is to hurl the
refuse out through another manhole at the bottom.
A pretty rotten job, as he stands knee deep in greasy
fish.
All the time the cutting-up is going on gulls wheel
and whistle about the ship and a few fish snap at the
scraps in the water. But when the digesters are
emptied there are swarms of flnnv things from
sharks to tiny mullet, and the shrill cries and
flapping wings of sea birds (albatrosses many of
them) magically increase. The beach near the Loch
Tay was strewn with enormous vertebrae, ribs and
jawbones. All the refuse can be converted into
manure, but our whalers were only after the oil.
They were kept busy. No sooner had they washed
down and cleaned out the boilers than a tender was
sighted rounding Point Perpendicular with more
fish. There is waste of manure, but no waste of
oil. Before the ship is docked the greasy decks
are carefully scraped, hundreds of pounds of oil
being obtained in this way. We were offered a
whale-ivory walking-stick for a guinea, and were
shown a photograph of 5001 b. of ambergris taken
from a sperm-whale. Finds like this are rare, but
the hope of making a punch in ambergris springs
eternal in the Whaler’s breast.

is is Delco-lighfr Model No. 866— the
size for the average farm. This pla|*t will j
light thirty-four 20-watt lamps continu-
ously when the engine is running. Fifteen'
lamps may he lighted continuously for
three and one-half hours from the large
capacity 160-ampere-hour storage hat-
erji or five 20-watt lights may be used
Jhree and one-half hours each .night for
three nights without -recharging the
battery.
The Low Cost of Electricity
FEW people realize how little it costs to own and
operate Delco-Light. One penny will buy enough
kerosene and lubricating oil to generate 200 watts of
electricity. This is enough to pump 235 gallons of
water on a 2 2-foot lift; run a washing machine con-
tinually for one hour; light one 20-watt lamp for 10
hours; light five 20-watt lamps for 2 hours; run a sewing
machine for 2 hours.
This low cost of electricity is due to the operating
efficiency of Delco-Light. All models have the famous
valve-in-head, four-cycle engine, with air cooled cylinder.
They are self-cranking and have only one place to oil.
The Storage Battery is of special Delco-Light type,
having thick plates, with both wood and rubber separ-
ators, insuring long years of satisfactory service.
The sterling dependability of Delco-Light, its low
cost of operation and high generating efficiency are being
proven over and over every day in the homes and on the
farms of more than 140,000 enthusiastic users in every
part of the world. There’s a Satisfied User near you.
We urge you to ask him what he thinks of Delco-Light.

‘ X Corner” : As a follower of cricket for
40 years I have seen most of the fast bowlers, in-
cluding T. Richardson, Lockwood, E. Jones, Cotter
and Gregory. All were right-handers. Has anyone
heard of a lightning-paced left-hander?
* * * St
Maoriland Cricket Assoc, has asked N. S.
Wales to tour the Ricketty Isles this season, and
the visit will be returned in 1922-3. An English
XI is to tour M.L. in 1923-4, and in the following
season the Maorilanders intend to perform in Eng-
land.

Little Matson, Adelaide’s featherweight
jockey, has had an unusual accident. A mare he
was riding at practice jumped a rail, struck it hard,
and broke it. A broken end flew up and jambed
in his stirrup, cutting the sole of his foot badly.
Ibis unseated him, and as he fell the mare kicked
him. He won't ride again for a few weeks.

A. O. Barrett, formerly amateur champion
walker of Vic., is just getting about again alter a
strange mi. hap. At the inter-schools athletic meet-
ing in Melbourne he was, with the other judges,
measuring and raking after a shot-put, when by
some misunderstanding the next competitor was
allowed to hurl the weight in among them. It
caught Barrett just above the ankle, and tore the
tendons of the calf; but he is likely to have no
permanent effect shows that it wasn’t
altogether his unluckv dav.

“Blackfriars”: France is now as crazy on
“pogo,” as it used to be on “diavolo” and the
scooter. The pogo is a wooden stick with foot-
rests and a rubber-tipped pad working on the end
of a strong spring. The leaping exercise which can
be got out of the contrivance is as fascinating to
the buffer of 50 as it is to the maid of 13, and there
is an element of danger when you use a pogo-stick
unadapted to your size, when the rubber tip is a bit
worn, or when you try to bound with it on a wet
pavement, that makes it highly alluring to the bone-
setting profession.
“Centurion”: Violoncello is only one of
scores of imported horses that have gone wrong - in
the feet or legs. Australian-bred nags rarely suffer
in this way. ' The English animal is reared on
damp, soft country, and the ground is an all-
important factor where equine legs are concerned.
Our own prads which have run from birth on hard
stony ridges are infinitely sounder than those bred
on the soft flooded country of such districts, say, as
the lower Balonne River in Southern Queensland.
For the same reason the Irish hunters bred on the
stony hillsides are usually sounder as well as gamer
than their softer-nurtured English relatives.
“Merrigal” : Tangalooma is the name of
a point on the inner shore of Moreton Island, and
means Merma’id. An appropriate name for a pros-
pective Gup or Derby winner might be chosen, by
the way, from the following: Gindthagee, to laugh,
i.c., make a noise like a bookie after a skinner;
geewongawong, madman (or punter who dreams he
can beat the layers) ; koombigi, by-and-bye (symbolic
of the infatuated optimism of the betting--man) ;
wargindina, crow’s feet (the result of trying to
pick winners) ; yandalahna, to sob (after the manner
of the Ring when a dead’un has come to light),
and (particularly felicitous) yanatherra, good-bye.

“Snell”: Sam Dane was the plainest boy
in the Melbourne ring 10 years ago. Some pugs
can go through a long fighting career and come out
with nothing worse than a slightly crumpled ear to
advertise their profession; others will pick up a
terrific disfigurement in one battle. Sam had
accumulations of 50 fights crowding for elbow-room
on his originally unprepossessing chiv. He Was the
most mutilated pug I have ever met. One night
when he w'as booked to fight a new' slayer from
Gippsland, an axeman in whom his discoverers
fondly imagined they had unearthed a world-beater,
the Cyclorama, Eastern Hill, was so empty that Sam,
who was fighting for a gate percentage, struck work;
Having looked the house over from his corner, he
suddenly threw off the gloves his seconds were fit-
ting him with, donned his horse-rug and, advancing
to the ropes, said: “Gents, I have to announce I’ll
see yous all d —d first.” The management appealed
to his sportsmanship. “I won’t fight,” Sam per-
sisted. “Gorstruth, you ain’t askin’ a bloke to
risk spilin’ his face fer 30 bob, are yeh?”

Arnold Wilson, who selected George Cook
as the opponent of Carpentier, has had to justify
the choice, and does it by rubbing out the Chances
of everyone else available—Moran, Bob Martin, Mc-
Cormick and Beckett. “First I eliminated the
Americans. I washed, and feel that the public
wanted, a Britisher to meet the Frenchman.” Of
the others the 21-year-old Irishman, “Boy” McCor-
mick, weighs only a trifle over 12st., and seemed
at the moment due for a licking from Joe Beckett —
w'hich he duly got. Beckett, says Wilson, is a crea-
ture of moods, winning easily only when he feels
sure he can. Against Moran and Carpentier he
felt dubious, and so he went out—-in a few seconds
in the latter instance, “All who saw him imme-
diately before those contests, and in the ring, could
see that he doubted himself” ; and he would not be
at all likely to feel confident if meeting Carpentier
again. So Arnold Wilson chose the Australian, who,
“if not altogether a'proved man, has done alb has
been asked of him ; has the advantage over Car-
pentier of youth, strength and weight; always keeps
in condition, and has never been knocked out.”

“Leagueite” : When the N.S.W. Amateur
Swimming Assoc, decided to allow League Rugby foot-
ballers (amateurs) to compete under its banner, the
N. S. Wales Amateur Sporting Federation argued that
the step meant the professionalising of all con-
cerned. In order to get an authoritative ruling, the
Australian Swimming Union, the body to which all
the State associations are affiliated, and which con-
trols amateur swimming throughout Australia, wrote
to the Federation Internationale de Natation Amateur
on the point. The Federation Internationale, the
controlling body which governs the amateur swim-
ming game throughout the world, replied that the
N.S.W.A.S.A. was quite in order, and that the Inter-
nationale Federation itself allows English amateur
swimmers to play with and against professional
Soccer and Northern Union Rugby footballers, “pro-
viding that the said amateurs make a statutory de-
claration to the effect that they receive no money
for their services.” It was always so in the Cold
Country; and the trouble which has arisen over
the question here w,as caused by a small clique of
people with vented interests liable to be adverseiv
affected by the mixing of the sheep w'ith the goats.

“First Mate”: In the good old days before
Governments learnt how to put in the gun, and when
anyone with a bag and a bundle of tickets could be
a bookmaker, Bassett and I journeyed to a Northern
Rivers- (N.S.W.) settlement for the annual races. The
bank was light enough when we started, but, after
buying our tickets to Teatville and Paying our ’bus
fares to the course, there remained only a pound-note
and a few pieces of silver. To impress the natives
and the two local leviathans. Bassett, a bull-voiced
Cockney, got going oarlv and offered to bet on the
Summer Cup (run that day at Rardwick). We didn’t
■strike a blow, however, until a long, angular, swivel-
eyed wench approached Bassett and inouired the price
of Daredevil in the, first race. “Evens,” quoth
Bassett. Sbe then arked if he was laying a double
on the Publicans’ Purse and Farewell Hardman, the
last two races. Bassett was —2 to 1 the double.
Swivel-eyes produced a fiver and had £lO to
£5 The Gift and Barebones. I nearly threw a fit,
but Bassett was quite calm and reckoned that the
yarn about swivel-eyes being unlucky war, apocryphal.
By laying dynamite odds we managed to show a clear
profit of a tenner on the first three races. But there
were only two starters in each of the last two
events, and home rolled the damsel’s double —The
Gift at 10 to 1 on and Barebones at 7 to 1 on. Bas-
sett makes a fair living at the ponies now. He
reckons a man’s got a chance there.

LIVERY
WEATHER.
What is Best to Take.
Just at present is probably
the; most trying period of
the year owing to the extreme heat, often
accompanied by great humidity, with wet
and cold snaps sandwiched in between.
It is this sort of thing that makes people feel washed
out, bad tempered and devoid of energy. Any kind of
work is most irksome. The business man goes home
each day with a headache or some other bilious
symptoms, and probably finds ,his wife and family in
a similar condition. None of them seem to know
exactly what they want or what is the matter.
In most cases it will be found that it is nothing
but the liver which has become disordered and
upset the system. Very simply caused, but
most distressing while it lasts. At such a time
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS are
most valuable, and will correct this trouble speedily
and restore the organs to regular action. They act directly; though gently, on the
liver, and by this means tone the system. Users Of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
are urged to take them more freely while the trying weather lasts, as the liver is
most apt to get out of order at this time of the year.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot”
Worm Pellets.
A SAFE, SURE AND RELIABLE
REMEDY FOR THE ERADICATION
OF WORMS IN CHILDREN AND
ADULTS.
Worms, by their movements and the in-
terruption they offer to the contents of the
bowels, generally occasion pain and uneasi-
ness in the abdomen, sometimes spasmodic,
sometimes gnawing or biting, and not infre-
quently of a vague, indescribable character,
and yet very distressing. Sympathetic with
this is a sensation of itching at the anus
and at the nostrils, producing a disposition
to scratch the fundament and pick the nose,
which is characteristic of this affection. The
bowels are often discolored, sometimes con-
stipated or stopped, and sometimes relaxed,
with occasional bloody discharges, as in
dysentery. The discharge is sometimes in
shreds or flakes, which are not infrequently
mistaken for fragments of partially digested
food. It is not uncommon for portions of
undigested food to pass with the discharges.
The appetite is exceedingly variable, in some
cases natural, in others deficient, craving or
depraved; one condition not infrequently
alternating with another. The abdomen is
often hard, swollen and tympanetic, the
breath heavy or foetid, and tongue furred,
with disagreeable taste, and a copious flow
of saliva : swelling of the upper lip, bleeding
of the nostrils and disposition to grind the
teeth during sleep, are other character-
istic symptoms. Tbe effects, however, often
extend beyond the alimentary canal, and
various derangements of health are experi-
enced in consequence either of the direct
irritation of the worms or of the disordered
digestion which they occasion. Among the
most common of these are nervous affections,
such as fretfulness, irritation of temper,
wakefulness or disposition to excessive sleep,
disturbed sleep, sudden starting out of sleep
as if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ments of the eyelids, dilated pupils, perverted
vision, temporary blindness and cjeafness.
General convulsions are not infrequent in
children, and symptoms strongly resembling
“Water on the Brain” have been ascribed to
worms, and have ceased on their exnulsion.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to re-
cognise tbe fact that their little ones are
suffering intense pain and distress, and are
practically irresponsible for the outbursts
of temper, restlessness and peevishness, and
until some more serious symptoms appear
nothing is done to alleviate the distress.
The symptoms of this disease are somewhat
variable, but generally they are so char-
acteristic that no mother need have any
doubts. The best proof of worms is worms,
and if the general conduct of the child is
such as to give the slightest suspicion, an
examination of the stools (evacuation from
the bowels) will afford ample proof.
A child who is affected with Thread
Worms will often appear to the eye to be
in an indifferent state of health. It becomes
peevish and irritable in its temper, and com-
plains of itching of the nose, whilst the
same symptoms may be very prominent in-
deed in the lower part of the bowel. An-
other point to which the attention of
mothers should be specially directed is that
the child is apt to start in its sleep, its re-
pose being in this way of a disturbed nature.
Note also that many children who are in the
habit of wetting their beds do so by reason
of the irritation which these Worms nro-
duce in the body, the irritation extending
to the bladder and causing it involuntarily
to nart with its contents.
In every heap of decaying matter there is
always to be found a nest of worms. They
breed and multiply in impure matter. And
so it is in the human system. The accumu-
lation of partially-digested food in the intes-
tines, which becomes outrid when the bowels
are constipated, induces the presence of
worms. A few doses of Comstock’s “Depd
Shot” Worm Pellets, followed by a dose or
two of Pr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, will
disturb them in their nest, and drive them
out of the system.
■Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal preparation,
compounded on a scientific principle for the
eradication of worms which infest the intes-
tines. They contain specific properties
which destroy the worms, but cause no
injury to the stomach or bowels, and do not
weaken tbe system. The pellets are pre-
pared in the form of a confection or lolly,
have no disagreeable taste or smell, but. on
the contrary, inspire children to take them
as they would an ordinary sweet.

Xmas Prices this Year.
The great slump in prices of all commodities
this year is largely shown in all our Christmas
importations we are pleased to find. The days
of prohibitive quotations have gone. The
great trade depression in Britain and, indeed,
the world over, has brought about a saner state
of affairs and has enabled our London buying
office to purchase at prices that are reasonable
and in some cases pre-war.
Our large spot-cash buying power has
proved tempting in the depressed markets, and
so we are showing the latest goods at prices
such as have been impossible for years past.
Best quality goods only, but at greatly
reduced quotations.

If you are fond of drawing you can
easily be taught how to make money in
your own home. There is such a constant
demand for new sketches that persons of
very moderate ability earn good fees.
But to get the best results you should
learn direct from a successful artist.
Under Mr. J. 0. Baneks, the well-known
cartoonist and caricaturist, and by his easy
system of lessons by post, many persons
of both sexes are now being trained to
do money-earning sketches.
Mr. Baneks himself supervises every
student’s work and personally corrects
and advises them by letter on each lesson.
Why Don’t

The Baneks School gives the finest prac-

and the terms are very easy.
Send your name and address (with 3d.

“Art that Pays” will be posted to you. It
tells you all about the School. If you can
already draw a little and you like to send
a specimen of your work (either original

Britaw ‘ Moving Pictures
u Merrie England,handsomely staged at
Melbourne Majesty s last Saturday, goes up
uke the proverbial rocket and descends like
the stereotyped stick. Musically, it never
descends. Edward German's score retains
its sweetness and grace of character to the
end. His respectable opera of “Tom Jones ”
produced in Australia 10 years ago, had not
prepared the public for such richly melo-
dious work as this. But modern' comic-
romantic operas do not live by the score
alone, and, when the plot in the second act
peters into the merest puerility and silliest
travesty of history, the reason for long man-
agerial neglect of “Merrie England” is ex-
plained. Although many of its lines are too
good to be lost, the second act should be
almost entirely reconstructed. A plot that
presents the heroine as an escapee from
royal wrath, living in a hollow tree-trunk
under the direction of an alleged young
witch who has broken gaol, until Queen
Bess, through the agency of the Earl of
Essex and with the complicity of Raleigh, is
frightened out of her wits by a conspiracy
of lies in which the whole strength of th<>
company participates—such a plot satislies
nobody. It annoys coinmonsense by running
counter to all the reasonable anticipations
formed in the first half of the story. The
music may not be strikingly original every-
where or anywhere, but its air of being
centuries old is always dignified, and the
charm of its_ slow dance movements is de-
lightful. It is great in concerted numbers,
such as the quintet, “Love is meant to make
us glad,” and its strong array of song and
chorus items includes “The Yeomen of Eng-
land.”
- * » * *
Charles Workman, helped along by
Victor Prince and closely identified with
the chorus, has a lot to do with the early
success. Howett-Worster, whose fine quality
of baritone gets noble backing from the
ensemble in “The Yeomen of England,” needs
only a judicious lining of cotton-wool to con-
vert his nightmare legs into dreams of manly
beauty. Ralph Errolle is a passable Walter
Raleigh, considering that his singing and
speaking tones and his personality suggest
the typical Italian tenor all the time. His
rendering of the “Rose” song in the second
act reminds one of Manrico in “Trovatore.”
Ralston does well as a forester who reiects
the cattish Queen of the Mav (Patti Rus-
sell) in favor of Bryl Walkely, a wan-
dering mezzo soprano who carries a cat in
a basket and is hunted for a witch. Patti’s
soprano is strong and clear, but Bryl’s sym-
pathetic warble is hardly big enough.

makes herself re-
membered by a

as well as by the
beauty of the song

tice. One of her
best effects is in
that number,
though it is with
the humorous
action-choruses be-
ll i n d and around
W orkman that
easiest encores are
obtained. Vera
Wheeler gets a lot
of humor into an
eccentric dance,
and MacCunn gets
a lot of good work
out of the orches-
tra. But what the
chorus gives him
for his trouble is
the real glory of
the show. Nothing
too eulogistic could
be said of the girl-part of that hard-working
organisation.

“Hit-the-Trail Holliday,” having its first
Australian run at Adelaide Royal, is a
Cohan comedy, just one more variant on the
recent American theme of the small town
and the eccentric newcomer who shows it
the way to prosperity. Billy Holliday comes
irom New. York as a famous cocktail-
mixer, but in his first hour of Johnsburg he
falls foul of the local brewing magnates,
father and son, and to spite them addresses
a temperance meeting. The papers “feature”
his slangy eloquence, and Billy finds himself
famous. He can have the agency for any
liquor he cares to boost, but he prefers to
make more money as a temperance lecturer.
Incidentally, he acquires a share in a near-
beer factory, booms it sky-high, and takes on
at increased wages all the discharged staff
of the local brewery. This idea is worked
out with all the proved successes of detail.
One has the flood of telegrams and ’phone
messages from “Going Up,” the strike-break-
ing from “A Tailor-made Man,” and “Wel-
come Strangers” evening-dress reception,
with the pardoning of the enemy at the
finish. There are many clever lines ; and
there are several artificial situations for the'
sake of an easy laugh or effective curtain.
A good f.a.q. comedy, so lightly drawn that
the house accepts its teetotal propaganda
without resentment.
This one-man show is Joseph Coyne’s
opportunity. He is more like “Lightnin’ ”

hand, makes up too young as a manlv

apologise* for not understanding baseball
slang; and in appearance he might be the
crack bat of the iocal nine. When he has
to call Coyne “my son” the contrast is rub-
bed in. Marjorie Bennett and Gwen Bur-
roughs attend to the quite unimportant
feminine parts, Stirling (with chin beard)

sive brewers, and the comic characters, with

The first three numbers of the Melba con-
cert in Sydney on Saturday night were from
Mozart; the overture from the delightful
‘Don Giovanni” and the dazzling “Ido-
meneo” by the orchestra created the atmo-
sphere for the songbird’s entrance in the
Zeffiretti Lusinghieri aria, which displayed
the Voice’s extraordinary purity of tone.
1 erhaps the opening phrases were just a
trifle breathless, but the just critic remem-
bered the broadside of curtseys and bows
the Dame had just fired at the audience.
Applause like a surf at Bondi followed
Muni’s Adieu from the third act of "Bohbme,”
and Voi Che Sapete.” More orchestra,
then accompanist Una Bourne showed what
she could do at the piano with orchestral
support in Liszt’s “Hungarian Eantasy,”
. was very correct but unemotional.
Despuis le Jour,” from “Louise,” was sung
with such a tone of ravishing recollection
that everybody under 30 in the audience had
a mad desire to fall in love on the spot ;
and double encores being the fashmn of the
evening, Melba returned with “Se Saran
Rose” and “By the Waters of Minnetonka.”
Two Debussv gems and Bemberg’s “Les
Anges Pleurent” ended the programme songs,
but three times Melba returned to s.ng, and
of the three recalls perhaps the most thrilling
was “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot!” All the
mysticism of the old plantation negro seemed
held in its phrases. Percy Grainger’s “Shep-
herd Hey” sent everybody away happy, and
there was a special clap coming for Jennie
Cullen’s fiddling in the Tschaikowsky number.
In “The Laughter of Fools,” which
arrived at the Sydney Palace on Saturday
night, John D. O’Hara has a part unusual
for him—that of a retired Englishman in
easy circumstances who grows roses and at-
tends auction sales to escape from the over-
powering society of a domineering wife
(Nellie Mortyne), a cattish daughter (Eileen
Sparkes) and a son (Roger Barry) who is
the quintessence of a bounder. The onlv
tolerable member of the household, apart
from the head, is a portionless niece (Doris
Kendal). An impressionable young man
(Cyril Maekay) with £15.000 a year is in-
vited down on a visit, so that the daughter
may annex his rent-roll and bank-balance.
Po the boisterous delight of her progenitor,
who has offered to lay 10 to 1 against the
favorite, he marries the niece. That is all
the plot there is in “The Laughter of Fools,”
but it is good, stuff all the same. The char-
acters are skilfully drawn, the dialogue is
lively and the acting is excellent. O’Hara
makes the henpecked cultivator of roses and
swede turnips a genial and attractive figure.
Doris Kendal’s work justifies her promotion
from the relatively poor roles she had in
Paddy” and “Peg.” Nellie Mortvne,
Eileen Sparkes and Roger Barry are faith-
ful to the author’s conception of the Three
Unwise Fools. And Lorna Helms’s imper-
sonation of a tormented parlormaid is a
little triumph in its way. Others in the
picture are Cyril Maekay, Eardley Turner,
Pine Bush and ,T. B. Atholwood.

There will be no more American-Irish
comedy at the Sydney Criterion for a while
after Friday night. Joe Coyne returns on
Saturday in “Hit-the-Trail Holliday,” which
is undiluted Yank.

Mountains,” at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, and
Goihg Up” will succeed “Theodore and
Co. at the Royal. The date in each case
is Saturday, December 3.
Frolies. of .1921,” at the Sydney
Irvpli, are a string of beads fiimsiiy threaded
and yanging from the merely tawdry to the
exquisitely colorful.. The magic carpet is
worn a little more threadbare in connecting
the nine scenes. Jack Somers (Leyland
Hodgson) conies into possession of the floor-
covering, and it is the' means of transport by
winch he. ami his valet Honeypots (George
Moon) travel through the piece. They pull
up at Jazzland, where Jack meets June (Cis-
si.e Vaughan) and Honeypots warbles and
dances with dainty One-Step Margie (Rene
Bailee), and thence they look in at all sta-
tions vm Honeymoonland to the terminus,
Vv eddingland. An early Christmas panto, in
tact. Some amusing topical burlesques are
featured; there is an O. Henry playlet, and
a b reach “Dance of Death,” and half-a-dozen
vaudeville turns (with Ada Cerito in the
lead) ; and George Moon and Dan Morris
provide a set of whirlwind dances with Lena
1 an ? Ra y McLean to the acomoaniment
of 14 pianos. “The Frolics” have bald
patches; but the show has this advantage—it
can grow whiskers or shave in a new place
and still preserve the parts that didn’t want
re-upholstering.

A very big house heard the revival of “Mr.
Inn Passes By” at Melbourne King’s on
batuida.v night. The company was in great
form. Marie Tempest gave 'a particularly
bright exhibition of feminine craft in sooth-
ing the moral qualms of a presumptive big-
amist. Her conception of Olive Marden seems
to have gained in satirical emphasis since
she was last in Melbourne : there is a subtler
suggestion of derision in her pretended rage
at the thought that her man is making too
small a stand for their happiness, and her
scoff is not so embellished by a farcical
undertone. Graham Browne shows the same
strained face of the conventional soul suffer-
ing from the in-fighting with an active con-
smence. Ashton Jarry repeats his picture
or Ca.rraway Pirn, the bomb-dropper, with
the vanished memory and the other engag-
ing characteristics. Marie Ney is not so
gushful and gawky as. Dinah Marden, but
aer young man (Frank Allanby) remains
the somewhat priggish revolutionist in art
and sentiment that the author presumably
intended.
*❖ * *
The Sign oh the Door,” now gone from
Melbourne King’s to the Royal, practically
abandoned all pretence of probability when
brank Harvey fell out of the bill, arid Ray-
mond Lawrence undertook his part. Ray-
mond played the profligate with good aco a nt
and expression. But he is the lightweight
who had previously been the artless youth
ith a tennis-racket: consequently Devereux
the Seducer seemed more of a vain youna^
pup than a dirty matured dawg when he
grossly libelled a lady in order to give the
drama a poor excuse for its cheap murder-
scene.

TV irths’ Circus is ending its Melbourne
season a stronger show than it was in the
beginning. The Lloyd gymnasts were a
valuable addition, and now Alfred Clarke, a
remarkably clever trick-rider in one act and
a juggler on horseback in another, has
arrived in company with the fatted Flemish
steed whereon he somersaults. Also, the

Two little show’s in Melbourne :
The exhibition of miniatures by Bernice Edwell
at Miss McLean’s studio, 125 Collins-street, adds
at least half a cubit to the artist’s reputation. The
33 items are remarkable for the amount of expres-
sion that the painter concentrates into an area fre-
quently the size of a threepenny bit. All round
the technical achievement is impressive. No 6,
“Padre,” is as good as any because it is a striking
likeness of a picturesque subject. Miss Edwell
evidently finds it more difficult to put the softer
features of her own sex with the same accuracy
upon ivory. One cannot identify Mrs. Brough and
Miss Emma Temple in Nos. 8 and 9, and there is a
view of a young amateur actress which is not faith-
ful to the damsel’s numerous charms. The minia-
turist does better in her studies of children; there
is an air of life-likeness about them. Especially
adorable is a chubby vision disguised as No. 18.
W. M. Whitney’s water-colors at the Melbourne
Atheiweum leave a feeling of disappointment. Whitney
is a craftsman of the Hilder type, but never has
the palette to produce the poetic dreams of land and
sea in the bewitching Hilder manner. Sometimes
he just misses a charming effect through the inability
of his color to warm to the occasion, and he gets
another bad mark here and there for his failure to
make the most of a composition. He is at his best
in his impressions of Sydney Harbor, though a
strange sobriety in his performance—-in “Across the
Harbor,” for example—somewhat clouds the verdict
in this section. His nocturnes are pleasing, their
shadows and mystery presented with the usual range
of greys and purples. “Ti-tree Swamp, Tasmania,”
is a picture of more original design, and this the
artist handles with a delicacy and care which make
his poorer displays elsewhere all the more surprising.
Clyde Cook leaves Sydney Strand and Hay-
market wiping the laugh from their eyes with
a called “Skirts/’ of which female legs
are the principal foundation. “The Lost
Romance” is the storv that keeps the Ly-
ceum’s heart athrob. The boredom that fol-
lows on a too-prolonged honeymoon is just
getting nicely broken up by the third side to
the triangle (male) when the well-meaning
friend of the family kidnaps the cheild of the
temale base. She turns to husband instead
ot to lover, which conclusively proves to her-
self and the producer that husband still
comes up to the collar of the suit
of Romance she had built for him
in courtship days. “Sunken Rocks”
nearly cause a shipwreck of two lives
at the Globe and Majestic, but a heavy de-
canter and a sudden heart-failure come to
their rescue. Hoyt’s The Australia and The
Piccadilly preach the sanctity of “A Man’s
Home.” and the same houses (jive shelter to
Ora Carew “Under Suspicion.”

“0.K.” remembers the nights of his youth :
Last week’s revival of “lolanthe” in Melbourne
set me thinking of the first Australian production
of the fairy opera, at tire old Royal, a production,
whereby the grandfathers of many young people in
the recent audiences used to swear. The dictum
that no subsequent Lord Chancellor was as good is
Robert Brough went unchallenged for years, and
th? glamor of the Brough tradition extended to the
whole cast. Yet I confidently assert that the pre-
sent co. did more justice on an average to the
humor of the libretto than the co. that was sup-
ported by a larger chorus and a wealth of new
dresses and scenery in May, 1885. Brough un-
doubtedly was an admirable Lord Chancellor, crisp
and dry in style, sharp and clear in enunciation,
redolent of the law-court when he looked over his
glasses and explained the difficulties of his position
on the woolsack, and an admirable dancer. But
Walenn, in his more unctuous manner, scores points
which have occurred to intelligent exponents or
stage-managers of the opera since 1885, and are not

OF 1921,” AT

less permissibly Gilbertian (whether officially sanc-
tioned by Gilbert or devised since his decease) than
the wisest modern readings of Shakspeare’s charac-
ters are Shakspearean. In one respect at least
Walenn is a more Gilbertian Chancellor than Brough.
He is smaller, and it was a small George Grossmith
whom Gilbert had in mind when he wrote the part.
Taking- one consideration with another, I would say
that the effect of Walenn is as fully satisfactory as
the effect of Robert Brough, and considerably bet-
ter than the effect of Frank Thornton and Howard
Vernon, his successors, t f other Australian originals
Nellie Stewart had a stronger personality ai.d a
better equipment for the character of Phyllis than
Patti Russell, the present exponent. Patti sings
it admirably, and cuts a pretty figure, but when
she tries to shake a leg she is a mere amateur in
comparison with memory’s picture of the accom-
plished dancer that Nellie Stewart was. Moreover,
Nellie had a charm of studied artificiality exactly
fitted to the costume and the coquettishness of an
Arcadian shepherdess pursued by a British House
of Peers. As regards Phyllis the palm must go to
I&SS, a time when every J.C.W. (or W.G.M.) lady
artist of note was a trained dancer. The rest of
the original cast was not nearly so illuminative as
the present one, if I except the minor character of
a cheeky fairy in which Aggie Kelton shone. The
Strephon, a gigantic baritone named Broccolini,
was more clumsy and less intelligent than Ralston,
who answers well enough to a biased mother’s
description of “extremely pretty but inclined to be
stout,” which invites the immortal line “I see no
objection to stoutness in moderation.” Thelma
Carter, graceful and a capable vocalist, is certainly
a more fairylike lolanthe than Emma Chambers
the plump little soubrette who was pitch-forked
into the part because she had been imported foi
drama, and was on the Firm’s salary list at the
time, oi’ than Ida Osborne, the concert-singer who
succeeded Emma. The original'Private AVillis was
Tom Bergin, taken from the concert-platform, and
quite unable to put the meaning into his lines that
Kavanagh gives them; the Fairy Queen was Mrs.
Brough—or Florence Trevelyan as she then was
billed—much too slim and young-looking for the
part of a large, massive contralto lady such as
Molly Tyrrell presents in a more forcible way;
and the two noble lords who become engaged to
Phyllis were played by Frank Boyle and Woodfield.
It flatters Boyle to say that he played, the part of
Earl Tolloller. He walked through it, a stage ama-
teur with a “green” appearance, an awkward gait
and a mighty fine voice. He delivered the lines of
“Spurn not the nobly born” with utter disregard
for the lovely satire of them. The scene between
Tolloller and the other Earl was not brightly
humorous when Boyle and Woodfield spoke the dia-
logue, for Woodfield, an experienced actor in his
way, was a light tenor with a rather effeminate
style that provided no contrast to his colleague. In
the present co. a heavy baritone, Hobbs, plays, the
part that was meant for a heavy baritone, and
makes an excellent foil to the fatuous, foppish Toll-
oller that Hay introduces. The possibilities of the
tenor part have- never previously been exploited
here, within my knowledge. James Hay wears an
eyeglass and suggests Lord Frederick Verisopht in
“Nicholas Nickleby.” Every word he speaks rings
true to the Tolloller he depicts. His sweet, light
tenor is much in need of rest, but that didn’t prevent
him from delighting me in the part that Boyle
used to murder 36 years ago. As for the chorus-
well, there was more of it in the first production,
and the costumes were richer, and the 20 marching
peers were all fitted with beautiful bald heads,
which they wiped from time to time with the hand-
kerchiefs they carried in their coronets. And the
absurdity of those 20 peers, all equally old and
bald and unmarried, was greater than the absurdity
of the mixed lot that gets away with 14 fairies
nowadays. A certain amount of true Gilbertian
humor is lost by omitting those bald heads, but one
can forgive the management for not having renewed
an expensive lot of inessential fixings when the orig-
inals wore out.
“Brum”: Baritone Richard Reading, of
Brunswick Heads (N.S.W.), followed his
Lismore success with Rex de Cairos-Rego’s
song ‘’Grief and Joy” by winning with it in
the “Australian Composer” section at Mac-
lean (N.S.W.) Eisteddfod the other day.
Incidentally, he won the five competitions he
entered for, including the vocal champion-
ship. Beyond choir training as a? boy
Reading is wholly self-taught. He is a
Chevalier of the Order of Leopold, and was
badlv wounded in ’l4 while fighting with the
Belgian armored-car service.
“Hamfat”: The Tivoli management is
bringing back Albert Whelan, who has a
place in English vaudeville all his own. It
was before the dawn of the present century
that he went to England, but he still sticks
to his title —“the Australian Comedian.”
Whelan had a son who was in the Royal
Air Force, and crashed, the announcement
of his death reaching the comedian just prior
to one of his performances
Louis Esson on Russian music:—
Thorold Waters, who seems to have a curious
prejudice against Russian music, although the Rus-
sians have been almost as great in music as in
literature, takes me to task (B. 10/11/’2l) for
still regarding Stravinsky as a serious composer,
despite the fact that he is not figuring this season
as a popular feature at the London “proms.” Surely
the composer of “Petrouchka,” a charming work
full of melody as well as psychological expressive-
ness, may be allowed to go his own path, however
new or dangerous it may be. He cannot be put
aside as a mere “destroyer of harmony.” All origi-
nal composers are at first regarded as destroyers
of harmony. ilebussy and Richard Strauss were
attacked on this ground, as Wagner was before
them. There are old gentlemen alive now who
think Wagner is too noisy. In his own time the
now classical Mozart used to shock Conservative
ears by his new and daring harmonies. Of course,
at Henry Wood’s orchestral concerts the all-Wagner
and all-Beethoven nights are the most popular. It
has taken Sir Henry 15 years of hard work to train
his public to accept these masters; and now that
they have reached this stage they feel safe, and
are not going to be disturbed by Stravinsky or any
one else who thinks that music is a living art and
still capable of developments. The older people are
in the majority; and “we must give pleasure to
the aged,” as Serge Diaghileff said with character-
istic irony. Thorold Waters says the public is a
sound enough judge of music. It probably is ; but
it takes time, usually a generation or two, to reach
a right conclusion. In matters of art Australia is
too often on the side of the aged. It has little
curiosity, it takes for granted that whatever is new
must have something wrong about it, and in many
cases it has only the courage of the opinion of the
generation before last.
“Crabtree”: Somebody said recently that
Alf. O’Brien, of the Musicians’ Union and
its advocate before Industrial tribunals, was
getting £6OO a year. That was his screw
before the H.C. of Union Secretaries went
up. His present salary reaches close to
£000; and that is a good deal less than the
£l2OO which, according to evidence given
in a case before Judge Rolin, he was offered
by the theatrical managements to look after
their industrial business. A. J. Davidson,
once President of the .Federated Musicians’
Union and Secretary of the Vic. branch, now
holds the job that O’Brien declined.
“Suds”: “Middle Blue” (B. 3/11/’2l) is
wrong. Ailsa Grahame made her first ap-
pearance with the Sydney Uni. Dramatic
Society in Stanley Houghton’s “Younger
Generation.” The curtain-raiser, “An-
chored,” which preceded it, was from the
gifted pen of Adrian Consett Stephen, on
whom the curtain fell in France. Gerald
Kay Souper began the polishing of the rough
diamond, but years of strenuous work in the
English provinces gave it the lustre of its
London setting.
‘‘Pitt Streeter”: An actor-chum com-
plained to me, “The critics in Australia
rarely give us any criticism. Do they think
we’d resent it? Not a bit! Let them only

tell us where our
faults lie—-not but-
ter everything up
as they are in the
habit of doing—
and we’d set about
improving o u r
methods and giv-
ing better shows.”
I happened to meet
B , who does
the “notices” for
t_h e ■ oldest-estab-
lished daily, a
little while after
that. Said 1:
“Why don’t you
tell the truth
about the actors
and the plays now
and then?” He was
quite candid. “I
did once on a time,
but it didn’t do
any good, so I
gave it up.” Next
day I ran across
the business man-
ager of one of our
leading theatres.
“W hat do you
think of B as
a critic?” I asked
casually. “Fine,”
said he; “we never
have any trouble with him.” So the situa-
tion seems a difficult one somehow.
“Ancient Prompter” : The most inveterate
gagster on the stage to-day is George Graves,
a close second being Huntley Wright,
brother to Bertie of that ilk, who was the
diminutive, shock-head xd brother of “Our
Miss Gibbs” in Australia. Both these jesters
have built up many musical-comedy “books
of words” that have won loud laughter on
this side of the world. But the daddy of the
lot was the still-living Arthur Roberts. I
doubt if any stage player ever compared
with the ancient wheeze-maker. Once he
got on the stage, in whatever company he
was appearing, or whatever piece, it was
good-bye to the “text.” His impromptu
witticisms were ever the best things in the
show. He was invited soon after he had
scored a very big hit in a Drury Lane pan-
tomime to make one in an all-star cast of
London actaws of Bulwer Lytton’s “Money,”
given as a benefit performance at one of the
West End theatres. Although at that period
the music-hall was looked down upon by the
“legits,” Roberts did not lose his head or take
any liberties at rehearsals, but on the day
of the performance his was easily the star
turn. Cast for the insignificant part of the
servant in the first act, he behaved like a
perfect little gentleman’s gentleman till the
act dron was about to fall on the hero
(Alfred Evelvnl asking his friends “Who
will lend me £lO for my old nurse?” Then
he stepped forward and with his hand on
his heart remarked, “I will. I got the
girl into trouble and I’ll see her through!”
“Norbell” : When the ’Murkan movie.“di-
rection” desires to pull out a cheap pathetic
stop, he invariably drags in mother bv the
hair of her venerable head. The. word is

all ignoble use”- in the land of the Stars and

CRITERION.
Charles Courtneidge as Alaric.
Tripe. It is the same in spoken drummer.
I remember a nasal perdoocer of a saccharine
“pretty” play in Melbourne calling for “a
guy who could sing some.” The guy stepped
forward, and when he asked what song was
wanted, the great man said, “I don’t care a
continental what it is, ’s long as you sling in
some puff about dear ole mother.” Har-
court Beatty told me, with a chuckle, of his
meeting with Andrew Mack in Sydney. At
the time Beatty was playing with Madge
Mclntosh in melodrama, and Mack had seen
the performance. “See here, Mr. Beatty,”
said he, “I saw you to-night, and, say, I
want you to sign up a carntrac’ with mo
right now. You are the man I’m lookin’
for.” Beatty asked the cause of this en-
thusiasm, and, with a voice shaken by emo-
tion or something, Mack explained, “Mr.
Beatty, I heard you to-night in the third act
say that wan word ‘mawther.’ ”
“W.M.”: Australian art has remained
singularly free from the later oversea influ-
ences. The leaders of post impressionism
are all safely buried and the cubists and
futurists are wearing glasses, yet Australian
landscape painters remain true to the school
of Manet, the founder of impressionism. In
his jazz scene in the Follies revue at the
Sydney Tivoli Harry Julius has skipped the
post impressionists and the intimists, and
has given a mixture of cubism and futurism.
Instead of a full length of a Johnnie wor-
shipping at the feet of a ballet-girl, you
see in a maze of color a pair of ogling eyes
and stray legs distributed indiscriminately
across the design. In a color scheme of
this kind allowance is naturally made for
the bright costumes of the dancers, so the
lower part of the back cloth is subdued.
“L.E.”: Though the one Melbourne per-
formance of “Patience” went amusingly
enough, Gilbert’s satire on the aesthetic
movement has little point nowadays. Bun-
thorne was meant for Oscar Wilde, and he
happened to be quite different from what
Gilbert imagined. According to W. B.
Yeats, Wilde was more like a Charles Lever
hero than a pale aesthete. His aestheticism,
which meant to him living in a fine house,
reading Greek and dining with duchesses,
was a reaction from his early surroundings.
His people were famous in Dublin for their
learning and untidiness. Yeats tells the
riddle of Wilde’s father: “Why are Sir Wil-
liam Wilde’s nails so black?” Answer:
“Because he has scratched himself.” Also
Lady Wilde’s saying to a servant: “Why
do you put the plates on the coal-scuttle?
What are'the chairs meant for?”
“Alwyn” : Mrs. Robert Brough is not “in
her old rdle” as Mrs. Chichester in “Peg o’
My Heart” (B. 17/11/’2l). Doris Gilham
played the part originally with Sara Allgood
and played it well.
“Lond”: An amateur theatrical show at
the end of November is to have a remark-
able cast. The play is Lytton’s stodgy old
five-act “Not so Bad as We Seem.” The
men of the cast are novelists lan Hay,
Justin McCarthy and Pett Ridge; painter
Orpen, actor-playwright Esmond, Prof, of
Architecture Richardson and poet Noyes.
The last-named has written an epilogue
pressing the claims of the movement con-
cerned—a children’s library in an old house
where Dickens lived when a boy.
THE GODDESS AND THE GIRL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
She seemed a goddess to revere—l love her still as
such—
An angel whom I thought it were a privilege to
touch ;
But had I loved herself in truth my wife she now
would be,
My own expensive, wayward Ruth, forever “touch-
ing” me.
My burning passion in the past I never dared to
show ;
So, though mv heart was beating fast, she ever
thought me slow.
In diffidence she saw no charms: she scorned a
timid chap,
And fell into another’s arms—the “very softest
snap.”
“It might have been,” sighed Ruth to-day, pretend-
ing quite a lot.
“Yes, might have been,” 1 had to say ; but, oh, I’m
glad it’s not.
She fills her place as Bertie’s wife; she fits into
the scheme.
’Midst stern realities of life I treasure love’s young
dream.
A warning and a dream as well, a fiction and a
fact—
A shrew with whom I’d fear to dwell; a vision to
attract.
Let Bert have all the pangs of pain that wedded
bliss may send,
Whilst I contentedly remain the sympathetic friend.

Thousands of Australians know the lovely
Xewlands cricket ground, where Armstrong’s XI
met the Western Province team on Saturday. It
was one of the show-places the Diggers were taken
to see by the kindly Capetown people - during the
war. By rights Western Province is about the
strongest non-Test XI in Africa, but on this occa-
sion Blanckenberg was resting with an injured thigh,
and R. R. Luyt, the captain and wicketkeeper, also
stood down. Why George Hearne, the young Eng-
lish pro., was not given a show in either of the
previous Tests has been a puzzle to cricketers in
this country. He knows more about really fast
bowling than most of the Africans, and is an artist
DOBBIE, a Victorian (and Australian)
bowling champion.
as regards the slow stuff. In Western Province’s
first innings, which totalled only 153, he made light
of Macartney’s length bowling, and hit a couple of
sixers off Mailey. He top-scored with 76; Thomas,
who is played for his batting, which is of the
plodding order, was the only man capable of stay-
ing with him. Thomas got 31. Australia, minus
Armstrong and its two star bowlers, and with Macart-
ney going in fifth wicket down, was obviously not
taking the contest seriously. The visitors knocked
U P 231 (Bardsley a showy 66) and were all
out by lunch time on Monday. Hearne opened for
Capetown side with Commaille, the international,
who is favorably remembered here, and they gave
an attractive display, as did Hands (40), who came
in when Mailev bowled the man from Kent.
The innings closed for 191, Commaille’s share
being a painstaking 62. Ryder got Luyt for a
duck, and Mailey, who was very' much on the spot
after the departure of Hands (40), took six wifckets
for 88.

A S’African record was put up in the
Second Test when Frank took Bhr. 38min. to make
152 runs. Frank has been very consistent against
the Australians, with 45 and 35 for Transvaal and
* n the Tests—272 runs, averaging 45.33.
Old Dave Nourse helped with 111 —his highest effort
m Test cricket. In five completed innings v. the
Australian XI, Xourse has scored 282 runs, averaging
56.4.
Cor Australia, efforts have been-
the feature of the Tests. He has taken 15 wickets
(at 16.26) out of 34 that fell to bow'lers, and has
scored 176 runs, averaging 58.66. In the five
matches of the tour he has the remarkable figures
of SO wickets, averaging 13.5.
* * * *
Blanckenberg, the African bowler who has
been performing well against the Australians, first
got into the limelight in 1912-13 when in a match
tor Western Province he captured 13 wickets at an
average cost of 9 runs. The following year he was
Africa’s main offensive against Douglas’s English
team, and proved that a ball with a high, medium-
paced trajectory that could conceal its spin from
the most watchful batsman became a nightmare
now and again. Since his successes against the
British and A.I.F. teams he has gone on adding
purple patches to his records. Playing against
Transvaal last December he took 9 for 78 out of a
total of 159.

N.S.W. Cricket Association’s big- fixtures
tor the season have been allotted. For the Shef-
field Shield the Ma State meets South Aus. at
Ade aide on December 6 and at Sydney on January
0; \ ictoria at Melbourne on December 24 and
at yd ney on January 26. Queensland will be played
. t Brisbane on December 3 and at Sydney on Decern-
in most of these matches the colts are likely
to get a chance, for the top-notchers won’t be home
by then.
* * * *
Two N. S. Wales teams started a trial
ntktch on Saturday in view of the approaching Shef-
field Shield game against Victoria. The certainties
were Punch, Kelleway, Asher, Ratcliife and Wheat-
ley. The bowling of Everett, fast-medium, relieved
the monotony towards the end of the afternoon. For
Pratten’s team, Hoskins, the Gordon left-hander,
made a tedious 26 before being run out, and Scanes,
whose style is more open, was sparkling in contrast
and deserves encouragement. Asher also shaped
well, though he, perhaps, was on the side of caution,
the rest—the whole side were only equal to 160 —
batted poorly. The fielding—and especially that of
Katcliffe behind—was first-class. Wall bowled best,
and should be a very useful man on a failing pitch.
Kelleway, whose side on the day’s play were three
down for 67, gave quite a dashing display.
Strange names figured on Saturday in Syd-
ney Grade-cricket, which was virtually a' contest of
seconds Xl’s. Dr. Poidevin, for Waverley, against
Gordon, having been given a few lives, knocked up
a patient 85 before Stenning got him. Jones (66)
who came with such a rush at the tail end of last
season, ran himself out when well in his stride; and
Ivippax, who is determined to be sparkling at all
costs, had a promising innings cut short bv Dive.
Dr. Campling, the Balmain googly merchant, hit
Petersham over the fence six times in the course of
Ins merry 107. Tytherleigh (50) was the only Bal-
maimac to stand by him. Campbell, who was in*
clined to lose his length, got 6 for 66. For Rand-
wick the consistent if unpolislied Achurch (182) made
Mosman’s bowlers look cheap. . Smith (94) helped to
place the total at 8 for 406. Dr. Trenerry went through
the Villagers with 7 for 36. He shines at club
cricket. Manly have got 9 of Paddington out for
115, Sydney (114) batted wretchedly and fielded
worse against Norths, and the Shoremen look like
winning easily. Hall (42) showed a return to form.
A. Thatcher, who impressed Douglas, kept a splen-
did length against C. Cumberland and took 6 for 34.
Fitzgibbon was the only orchardist to stand up to
the bowling. Marrickville—G. Thatcher (45) —have
the game well in hand. Glebe (130), without Kel-
leway, are Wests’ meat. They found Dight (8 for
56) very difficult. The Sundowners have lost 2 for
91. Kendall (4 for 30), the ’Varsity fast bowler,
got St. George on the run, hut Hughes (70 no)
stopped the rot and the Botany Bavites have a
winning chance.

Walter S. Duff, who died at Sydney the
other day, aged 46, was one pf Ma State’s greatest
cricketers in his time. He repped for N.S.W., and
only rotten luck kept him out of the Tests. He
was a brother of the late Reg Duff, who used to
open with Trumper.
* * * *
Melbourne’s wonderful climate, which can-
not be relied upon for more than two minutes, was
responsible for another lost day in District cricket on
Saturday. It was lOOdog. in the shade on Friday, hut
a sudden change in the night opened the heavens
and left the wickets hopeless.
* * * *
Melbourne Grammar, which seems to be
the strongest side in the Vic. Public Schools’ compe-
tition this season, knocked up the huge score of
625 against Geelong College last week. H. Austin
(124), B. Dunlop (119) and G. Ewings (118) were
the principal smiters, but F. S. Vine (75) and
Farmer (56) also provided some hunting. As the
rain prevented the match being played out, Gram-
mar won on the first innings by 466.
Vie. State members made a rotten showing
on the M.C.C. Ground last week against a Navy XI.
In the first innings the politicians notched only 45 j
of which sundries contributed 10. One Glass disposed
of prohibitionist Greenwood for a cypher, but there
were six other Parliamentarians who* fared no better.
Macandie’s blue-water men knocked up 205, five
retiring to give all hands a knock.
Xavier College (Melb.) possesses a pro-
mising young cricketer in K. Schneider, who per-
foimed brilliantly against Melbourne Grammar the
other day. He knocked out six Grammar bats for
66, performing the hat trick, and hit up 85 in
the second innings. And he is exceptionally reliable
in the field. Only 14, he is probably the youngest
player in public-school cricket.

Jack Maclaren, who died in Brisbane a
few days ago, was easily the best fast bowler Queens-
land has produced, though the abo. Henry may have
had a bit more pace. He was given a game in the
Fifth Test against Warner’s team in 1911 and went
to England with the 1912 Eleven, but a wet year
handicapped him. Playing for his State it was quite
an ordinary experience for him to see three or four
chances dropped in the slips off his opening overs;
but in spite of his red head he took it all philoso-
phically. He was a fine footballer, and represented
Queensland several times as a three-quarter, notably
against England in 1908. He contracted lung
trouble in England in 1912 and never was right
afterwards.

Many are inclined to discount the class of
the brilliant filly Furious because of the compara-
tively poor showing of Cupidon in the M L. Derby,
when he ran third to
winning Hit and The
Hawk. But on that
occasion Cupidon was
practically left at the
post, and when he
tried for the rails,
just before entering
the straight, he got
shut off* and had to
go round. Even then
he was finishing over
the top of everything
else. The winner and
The ? Hawk had a
clear run all the way.
If they meet in the
Great Northern Derby
at Auckland at the
end of the year, those
who saw the race will
again pile their coin
on the conqueror of
Furious.

The Kangaroos thudded for the fifth time
last week, when Swinton, on a wet ground, wal-
loped them by 9 points (1 try 3 goals) to 0. The
Aussies, handicapped by a greasy ball, found the
defence too solid to penetrate, and the re-shuffling
of the players would seem to have ruined their
combination. Broadfoot, the Bananaland winger,
was custodian; B. Laing, the Maoriland five-eighth,
took Vest’s place at centre three-quarter; Johnston
worked the pack vice Duncan Thompson ; and Felix
Ryan, the Newtown rueker, bucked in alongside the
venerable Sandy Pearce. It was Swinton’s first
victory over an Aussie XIII. The match against
Dinny Lutge’s original 1908 ’Roos w'as abandoned,
whilst Mclvivatt’s 1912 quota outed them by 28 to 9.
In the match against Huddersfield on Saturday
Fraser played back, Vest and Carstairs replaced
Craig and Laing as centres. Craig played on the
wing vice Blinkhorn, and Duncan Thompson again
appeared behind the pack with Oaples. Mick
Prentice hooked vice Sandy Pearce. Huddersfield
crashed by 86 points to two—the first time this side
has ever gone down before an Australian XIII.
It is regarded as the show club of the Northern
Union, and has engaged, in its time, many Aus-
tralasians such as Maorilanders Con Byrne, Wrigley,
Trevarthen, and Sydney lads Rozenfeldt and Tom
Gleeson.

Saturday was the opening day of the Port
Phillip (Vic.) yachting season, but the weather was
such that all the fixtures were off but the 10-mile
event for B-class boats at Brighton. Seven started, The
Rip showing the way to Itillara and Idler across
the line. Idler rounded the weather mark a minute
ahead of The Rip, but young Archie Cox, skipper
of the former champion six-metre craft, and the
only man to set a spinnaker all day, headed her
on the run. On the punch back to the Middle
Brighton pier. Idler’s plate tackle became jambed
in the pump, and she had to be nursed along for the
rest of the journey. In the second round The Rip,
liking the heavy weather, increased her lead, eventu-
ally beating Windaira home by a minute, with Idler
another minute away third.

Scotia (22min.) took the invitation race
for the Rawhiti Cup, staged last Saturday by Syd-
ney’s R.P.A. Yacht Club, with owner C. T. Brock-
hoff on the bridge. But because she is not on the
R.P.A.Y.C. register, the bauble will repose for the
next 12 months upon the sideboard of J. S. Palmer,
owner of Aoma, which, splendidly handled by Stan
Stevens, finished 2min. after Scotia had dropped the
bunting. Rawhiti’s spinnaker blew inside out on
the run from Shark Island, and at this stage Aoma
led. At Pinchgut Stan Stevens had slightly in-
creased his lead from Brockhoff’s craft, but, with
sheets inboard for the second punch down harbor he
slipped badly, by working the eastern shore, and
Scotia, sneaking down on the Chowder side, eased
away at the Pile Light fmin. to the good, and was
never afterwards headed. The cruisers’ race under
the same burgee went to Jimmy Alderton’s new 21ft.
restricted-class dugout Gumleaf, off the 6min. mark.
Athene (D. Carment), 7min., sailed a great boat
until she twisted at Pinchgut the second time, when
she was headed by the winner and Burraneer, which
last was only downed by lOsec.

The two Eras, Symonds, of England, and
Goozeman, of the U.S., gave an impersonation of 9st.
threshing-machines at work in Sydney Stadium’s
hempen square last Saturday night. The Britisher
boxed better than at any time since his arrival here,
retreating before Goozeman’s whirling onslaughts to
such purpose that the Yank was rarely able to touch
him, and then coming back with that catastrophic
left of his. Goozeman has a useful left, too, by
the way, and on one occasion downed the enemy with
it by means of a beautiful hook to the jaw. When,
at the end of 20 frenzied rounds Joe Wallis said it
was a draw, the crowd hooted him for his poor
taste; and as Symonds faced his masters even
thumb was _ up-turned. But it was the closest of
close things, with the Yank always scoring by hi-
aggressiveness and the Englishman” invariably equal-
ising matters with his clean hitting and skilful
evasion.

After 20 rounds of hard pounding at the
Melbourne Stadium on Saturday night, Jerry Sulli-
van, of Sydney, was adjudged to have broken even
with the inexhaustible Jamito, from the Philip-
pines. The decision was heartily unpopular, most

had won by a street.

.T. K. Ayres-Oosterlaak, of Pretoria Har-
riers, who is tripping to Australasia with the S’Afri-
can athletic team, did finely in the recent Trans-
vaal championships at Johannesburg. He took the
100yds. (10 l-ssec), 220yds. (22sec., equalling the
S’African record) and 440yds. (49 l-ssec.). B.

on Saturday, the outstanding effort was ex-schools'

the furlong, “Slip” Carr (N.S.W. champion) won a
heat in 24sec. with a damaged ankle. With South
Sydney, cross-country champion H. L. Sheaves took
the three miles (16min. 50sec.), and the versatile
A. W. Winter won the javelin throw (126 ft. 74in.)

Kirkwood and East licked the amateurs
Eric Apperley and W. C. Sturrock in foursomes at
Manly (Sydney) last week by two up and one.
Kirkwood was faultless, without being brilliant.
Sturrock was patchy for the most part, though at
the 13th he made the others blink by holing in
two, thanks to a wonderful 10ft. putt. Apperley
played a great all-round game.

The Adelaide football squabble has been
settled, but not before it had come to a Supreme
Court action —Edwards, hotelkeeper and member of
S.A. Assembly and the City Council, with his West
Adelaide Club, versus all the other delegates to the
League, with McLaehlan, its chairman. The Bar
engaged was Cleland, Villeneuve Smith, Piper and
Isbister, all K.C’s., and four other lawyers. Edwards’s
words at a meeting long ago, which" made his col-
leagues of to-day refuse to admit him, were: “There
are many among you who are gentlemen whom I am
sorry to leave. Others among you are vermin from
whom I am glad to part.” On the bench was Par-
sons, who is making a name as a commonseuse
Judge, and he told them to go outside and settle
their squabble. So all parties went out; and three
days later they came back to say that the hatchet
is buried. Edwards expresses regret for the “ver-
min,” and the League admits him and pavs every-
body’s costs.

Though rain prevented the finish of the
Yic.-N.S.W. tennis match in Melbourne on Saturday,
the Victorians got the decision through an over-
whelming margin of points in the opening games.
Out of the 12 big singles battles the Ma State
scored only one rubber, Henderson knocking out
Heath (4 —6, 6—3, 6—2) by superior accuracy in
his ground play. Up to the suspension of hostilities
Heath, with Dr. Mackay as his partner, had scored
Victoria’s only black mark in the doubles, Neil and
Peach capturing the second and third sets (6—o,
6—l) after the Victorian pair had easily snatched
the first by 6 games to 3. The international experts,
Patterson, O’Hara Wood and Hawkes, were never
troubled by the opposition in the singles. Neil
grabbed one game in his two sets with Patterson,
O’Hara Wood outplayed the veteran Bice (6 —4,
6—l), and Hawkes walloped Henderson (6 —3,
d 1) • Henderson and Utz, however, showed some
dashing tennis on Saturday against Patterson and
Wood in the Doubles. Though they were up against
a formidable server and stroke artist, and one of
the greatest doubles performers in the world, the
visitors did extremely well, Utz using a brilliant
racquet at the net. Their scores (4 —6. 2—6) give
no indication of their form. The harborside ladies
were also routed. They lost every rubber in the
doubles, but retrieved one in the singles, Miss Grey
being the_ lonely victor with a score of 9—7, 2
6 —o against Miss Mountain. South Aus. made a
better showing against another Vic. team, but
the local crowd is well ahead.

Adelaide lias no\y decided definitely on
municipal golf. A sporting little nine-hole course
already existing on the park lands by Montefiore
Hill is being enlarged to the regulation 18 holes
and thrown open to the public. Already the City
Council has received about 100 applications for mem-
bership, and this is expected to more than pay all
expenses of upkeep. The subscription for men is to
be two guineas, for women one, but anybody can
have a round for a simple shilling—double price
Saturdays and holidays.

Colonel Aides, the S.A. colt, has always
been an unlucky beast. He was born out of season,
brought up on a bottle, and had the worst of an
argument with a barbed wire-fence when a baby,
Anri now the vet. reports that during the rough
passag'e in the Melbourne Cup his shoulder was broken
in two places.

Mille Glade, swimming instructor to the
New York Y.W.C.A., is alleged (1) to have swum
round Manhattan Island (about 40 miles) in just
under 16 hours, and (2) to have swum 153 miles
on the River Hudson (i.e., from Albany to New
York) in 63hr. 35min. They are both easily
women’s world’s bests.
THE WASHINGTON GRAND NATIONAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tiie object of the Conference at Washington is
evidently not to secure Peace, but to make War
cheaper.”
’Ere! What’s that the bookies are calling? “An
’undred to seven bar Strife l”
Last week they laid odds on Strife falling! Lad,
’edge on him! ’Edge for yer life!
They’re sharper than needles, these layers; they’ve
’eard something, you may depend.
Old Chuck It’s stock never was stayers. They mostly
blow out at the end.
’Ere’s Bloodshed (by Gas out of Slaughter) ; ’e
rushes ’is fences, they say.
An’ Gore, good old Bombing Plane's daughter—ah !
’e was the one in ’is day!
An’ now see the white cap and jacket—pure white,
like some little lamb’s fleece.
Xo wonder they’re making a racket. That’s Uncle
Sam’s Chuck It mare, Peace.
They’re orf! ’Ow they flew them first ’urdles!
There’s Submarine making the pace!
(The blood in one’s veins fairly curdles to think of
what ’angs on this race.)
With Strife jumping boldly and cleanly, ’ard ’eld by
the boy on ’is back.
The Lord knows what made ’em think meanly of
that one. ’E moves like a crack.
The white cap and jacket is coming! You beauty !
What fencing ! What pace !
Now ’ark how the grandstands are ’umming, and
look at the smiles on each face!
Sire’s cutting down Famine and Sorrow; she’s settled
Blue Ruin and Rage!
By God, they’ll acclaim her to-morrow the wonder
and joy of the age.
Strife’s finished! His burden’s too weighty. The
Yankee is licking him cold.
The Ring “takes an ’undred to eighty the Chuck It
mare.” ’Ave we bin sold?
’Ere! What’s that out there by the “distance”?
It looks—Yes it is! It’s a fall!
Was ever there such inconsistence? It’s Peace — an’
she’s down at the trail!

Civil servants killing time in the corri-
dors of the public offices last week suddenly
became alert when they observed Melba
arrive at “The Lands.” Some edged nearer
to her in case she might need a cicerone, but
she made straight towards her objective. At
the door of the room of the Secretary of the
Closer Settlement Board she met a braw
lad who had looked gran’ in his kilts when he
had them on the day before, and who wished
he had ’em on now. She claimed a “ren-
dezvous” —that’s what she called it —with
Mclver, Secretary for Lands, and the young
Scot, saying “Follow me, Madame,” swept
everybody aside with the awesome announce-
ment: “Dame Nellie Melba.” The nine-to-
fives waited about till she emerged, as if
they expected her to warble like Gloria did
in “La Cigale” when she was out walking—
but she passed on. The visit was only
about a little matter of business between the
Dame and the Department.
A wedding story is related of a pair who
were lately united at a suburban church.
The sun forgot to shine upon the bride,
nevertheless the motor engaged to take her
to and fro was an open one, and, when
she tooted from the church with her ’groom
in charge, calamity befell. Rain poured in
torrents. Awful rain. The motor had six
inches of water in it before the ’groom yelled
to the s'nover to stop. He had spied a
verandah, and away he fled for shelter, leav-
ing the bride to get out as best she could in
her bedraggled state, and make for the same
verandah. Obviously she felt a bit neglected
on that day of days. A soaked bride doesn’t
expect to be left in a water-laden vehicle
whilst her pride and joy is rushing to get
in out of the wet. But old custom had
blunted his sense of a bride’s importance, it
seemed. He had already buried two part-
ners.
The Lauchie Mackinnon pair held 'll be-
lated race-season jazz frivol at their Toorak
place on Thursday evening. Lady Stradbroke,
who patronises all the most Tooraketty
private parties, was the star guest. Cart-
loads of red roses were used in decorating
the eating-rooms, and there was another
load of pink blooms in the parlors. Only
quite the “best” people were there, of
course, save in the male dancing section,
where even the most finicky Society hostess
can’t afford to be too particular. Mrs.
Lauchie was frocked in black, flecked with
gold. Lady Stradbroke had green chif
fonery, daughter Helena aired new uphol-
sterings of silver and green, while little Lady
Digby trailed peach-colored draperies. A
Sydney damsel. Alison MacCormick, whirled
in blue and gold.
Weekly dinners are now the rule at State
Government House. The party is generally
about 30. There is no stiffness or formality,
and the menu is nice but not elaborate—
such a dinner as our Earl might give to
familiar friends in his baronial hall in the
Cold Coun try.
Muriel Isaacson, the younger daughter of
the Majah, has said “Yes” to a young
Maorilander who is visiting Melbourne—
Stanley Caro, son of the late L. Caro, of
Auckland. The lass, who is now embarking
upon her own trousseau, was one of Dorothy
Pearce’s rainbow bridesmaids * tew months
back.
Yvonne, daughter of the tote J. B. Devine
and Mrs. Devine, of Merriang, Brighton,
who was altared to Mrs. Teddv Ball on
November 9 at the local Joan of Arc Church,
was one of the most popular girls in her
locality. The. wedding was a frocky affair.
The young bride wore pink and white with
a wonderful train of brocade and lace ; the
bridesmaids were in shot-blue taffeta and
silver lace, and small boys wore white sat’n
through the ordeal of carrying the train
and the cushions. Father Hoare did the
marrying; and the bride’s sister, Mrs. Fred
Sheahan, gave the wedding breakfast at
Moofred. The pair are to live in Sydney.
The latest Sassiety engagement involves
Kenneth Svme and Sylvia Currie. She is
one of the Millicent (Toorak) Curries, a
grand-daughter 0 f the Captarn Currie: he
is a son of the late J. C. Syme and Mrs.
Syme, of St. Kilda.
Outliving by 20 years her husband, the
former member for West Bourke in the Leg.
Assembly, Mrs. S. T. Staughton got the call
from Beyond a few' days ago at her home, St.
Neot’s, South Yarra. She was president of
the Australian Women’s National Club, an
ex-vice-president of the A.W.N.L., and was
associated actively with several philanthro-
pic institutions. Daughter of John Hop-
kins, of Wormbete, Winchelsea, she was
accustomed in her girlhood to the prosperity
she enjoyed as a Staughton dame. The
pain inflicted by her husband’s d.ath was
intensified when her handsome son, a cap-
tain and D. 5.0., who succeeded dad as mem-
ber for West Bourke, faded out after an
appendicitis operation. Four married
daughters and a son (A.J.) survive her.
Mary Cross, who four years ago helped to
found the hostel for working girls in Gore-
street, Fitzroy, and afterwards was its
matron, has gone over to Shadowland,
lamented by the girls whose lives she bright-
ened, and by the Catholic Women’s Guild,
which backed her efforts. With her brothers
she formerly held land at Mulwala, in the
Ma State. She was only 58.
News comes of the sudden death in Paris,
while touring, of Mr 3. F. B. Clapp, widow
of the former managing director of the Mel-
bourne Tramway Co., and mother of Vic.’s
Chief Railway Commissioner. It is only
about a year since Clapp, senior, faded out,
and a few months later his widow went to
Europe with her two daughters. In the
days when her husband was the tramway
autocrat, Mrs. Clapp was known to a large
circle of friends, but latterly she had lived
in quiet retirement.
Full of years, many of them busy with
toil, Mrs. A. M. Miller, of St. Fillan’s, Nar-
bethong, answered the call last week while
at St. Ivilda, and was laid away in Brighton
Cemetery. The chief mourner was her
daughter, Marion Miller Knowles, the writer
of verse. After Jimmy Munro relinquished
it as a country residence Mrs. Miller took
St. Fillan’s, and ran it successfully as a
holiday resort.
The late Jim Oman was a man of many
interests; besides being a success on the
land and a sound friend to young settlers
he had a taste for good pictures. He didn’t
buy very often, but when he did he went
for the best. He was a keen admirer of Max
Meldrum and was the proud possessor of
two of this artist’s best large French land-
scapes, besides work by several of his
followers.
The Alfred Hosuital appeal had a cafe
chantant a few days ago. Myers gave his
tea-room and the aid of his staff, and vol-
untary helpers sunolied music. Kirby
warbled from beneath a metamorphosed
moustache —the wonderful appendage has
now been reduced to five fretful hairs on
each side. Noel Flemming and tenor Keat
also put an item or two on the programme.
The Green Ball—the “Grand Juvenile
Fancy Dress Ball” given annually by Mrs.
Green and daughter Florence —is to happen
in the Town Hall on December 5, which is
the Monday before the Sunday on Which
everybody will be reading the Christmas
Bulletin. Numerous Governor folk have
promised to watch the show, and the mayoral
pair will also be among the spectators.
Here is Ethel Jackson Morris, Mel-
bourne’s clever illustrator of Fairyland, faith-
fully presented by Muntz, of Malvern. Her
dainty drawings,
which have com-
manded passing
notice at the Vic.
Artists’ and the
Arts and Crafts
shows in Melbourne,
were lately hung in
greater abundance at
the Fine Art Society
and impressed a lot
of people. The art-
ist’s performance is
the result of seven
years’ hard work,
much of it done in
the National Gallery,
where she managed
to satisfy the criti-
cal Bernard Hall,
who expressed his
admiration by buying one of her best efforts
a while ago. She has now started definitely
on book-illustration, and those Who want to
be beguiled into a belief in fairies ought to
acquire “White Butterfly” (published by the
De Garis Co.), for which the brilliant girl
has supplied the letterpress and several
drawings in color and black-and-white.
Our women’s organisations are agitating
to have some petticoated J.P.’s appointed,
but Arthur Robinson, the Law Minister,
isn’t rushing it. Townsend McDermott, an
ex-Solieitor-General, when ask°d by a friend
whom he had made a J.P. how he could
“brush up best,” advised him not to bother
about law books —to look wise and say
nothing. But that novice wasn’t a lady.
The Falkiners are a very sporting clan ;
all the brothers own racehorses except
Ralph, usually known as “B.” “B.” once
had a racehorse which he won on a wager,
but the nag sprained its leg, since when
he has. raced no other. H s pet sport’ng
hobby is his aeroplane, w r hich he uses regu-
ia rly on his trips to his sheep-run across
the border. The journey cuts into the best
part of two days, ordinary travelling, but
the air-’bus does it in an easy three-and-a-
balf hours. Falkiner tips the scale at 19st.
or thereabouts, and his pilot isn’t thistle-
down either.
Edward Officer’s widow has sold the Mace-
don home and gone into a flat in South
Yarra. She was a Fitzgerald girl—daugh-
ter of the knighted surgeon.
St. John Ambulance Society is softly
appealing for help, and Sassiety intends to
make a week of it with bridge Darties, after-
noon teas and the
rest of the charit-
able box of tricks.
The response should
be good, for no citi-
zen knoweth the day
when he will have
need of a ride in one
of the ambulances.
Herewith is a por-
trait of 11. A. Os-
good-Cannon, who
has been identified
with St. John for 20
years and is its chief
officer. On his re-
turn from the South
African War in
1902 he was given
charge of an ambu-
lance waggon su il-
plied by the Board of Health. Soon afterwards
the St. John Association took over the wag-
gons which had been manned bv the Metro-
politan Fire Brigade, and tenders were called
to i‘Un the service. Gannon got the con-
tract and retained it for nine years; then
the whole service was re-organised with him
as chief officer. s?he State Government this
year refused a subsidy on the ground that
the service is l-eally municipal; but the City
Council has. been generous and private dona-
tions come in steadily. More cars are, how-
ever, needed, and that means more money.
The Steward dame, president of the Council
of the Ambulance Service Guild, is working
hard with her committee-ladies to boost along
the present appeal.
From a girl who has come home:—
The W.C.T.U. Convention the other day denounced
mothers who had been seen taking cocktails in the
presence of their daughters, and women who smoked
cigarettes even at parties—Well-dressed
women, too 1 Shocking- as these habits are, they
are mainly due to excess of that brand of loyalty
which moans the imitation of all things English.
The British matron has always been accepted as our
model; but since Queefl Victoria died the matron
has broken out in an unexpected way. Her charac-
ter hasn’t changed; she is as formidable and im-
placable as ever. But now she is liable to light
her cigar in a Crowded train, this tremendous female
who glowers disdainfully at the weak men puffing
fags. The Australian dame hasn’t quite caught up
yet.
Art-meaning the art that plays the name-
part. —is having the time of its young life in
Melbourne. Somebody or other is forever
asking people to come and see his paintings
or his etchings. The chief exhibitor of the
moment is Heysen, and the scene is Gill’s
gallery. Heysen was always an artist whom
Melba delighted to honor, so the Dame has
been asked to declare the exhibition open,
and will be there at 3 p.m. this Thursday.
Melbourne’s Shakspeare Society celebrates
its annual break-up on December 2. That is
when good old boys and girls have prizes
awarded to them, and a speech or two having
been delivered, a mixed entertainment is
offered. Lady Forster has promised her
attendance; and if the Society has not de-
ceived itself some sweet voices will be heard
in ballads.
Mrs. Dunbar Tweeddale and her sister
hostessed a cheery musical tea on Thursday
afternoon at Pearson’s, which has risen from
the ashes of the Savoy. Tenor George
Brooke, Irene Certo and Frank Hanna, an
Anzac, sang to the assemblage, and the cafe
orchestra also did its musical bit. About 70
of the best people defied the heat-burst with
iced coffee and ices. Actor William Kelly
sat at a table with the Bridges lady, Mrs.
Alec Landale, Mrs. Herbert Power and some
other social lights. The Mayoress blew in
at half-time, and the Maudsley and Best
dames drifted in after the first vocal items.
The youthful best-lookers included the
Westralian Parker knight’s youngest
daughter, just back from an Indian trip.
One hostessing sister was tailored in dove-
grey, with a flower-decked black hat; the
other in pale yellow, topped by becoming
blue.
At the Town Hall on Friday afternoon
(D?c. 2) the Thompson sisters “present”
their tenth annual demonstration of kinder-
garten music methods. Coming on top of
Music Week the interesting little show has
a special appeal.
The Toorak and South Yarra end of the
Alfred Hospital Auxiliary has just handed
the institution 200 pillow-slips and some-
thing like that many towels, ns a result of
the month’s effort; and now’, after giving the
Homoeopathic Hospital appeal a lift, the
nigh-powered ladies are bustling round col-
lecting fat chooks for the Alfred patients’
Christmas dinner. Mrs. Bob Ivnox, of
loorak, will gratefully take over your
roosterlet, or your coin, if you feel like giving
them a hand.
Melbourne’s fraternity of Ancient Mariners
gave a nautical song and chanty concert at
rue i J layHouse on behalf of a little lot of
feea Scouts and Mercantile Marine Cadets
who are schooled in the rudiments of ocean
We on the gentle wavelets of Albert Park.
P u ® 0.-G. turned up at the mild shivoo and
made a speech, not as an Ancient Mariner,
but as one wno has always loved ships and is
never, never sick at sea. His Ex. has done
nothing more useful since he came to Aus-
tralia than his little bit towards encourag-
ing the sea-scout movement. It isn’t a rapid
movement, for it doesn’t get the boosting
the boy scouts on dry land received from
Baden Powell. What it wants is a means
to bring it right under the notice of the
breezy young imp who would run away to
sea if he knew a nice, kind pirate ready to
apprentice him. Perhaps the Mariners’ best
plan would be to call their training craft a
pirate ship and fly the skull and crossbones
ensign at the prow, or the helm, or wherever
the desperadoes of Penzance used to hitch
their bunting.
Kyneton was like its old self 35 years
ago when it had its new showground opened
by the Earl. The Eight Horse rode oflt
toward Malmsbury to meet his Ex., and Old
Piper-street, which has been somnolent since
business was taken up the other end of the
town to Mollison-street, woke up and shook
itself. Stradbroke was as well received as
the previous Earl (Hopetoun), who is still
regarded as the top-notclier among Governors;
Even the rays of the honeymoon can’t
make habitual jazzers forsake their altar.
News comes that the Sid Dalrymples, who
are honeymooning by the Harbor, varied their
little twosome by dashing into the limelight
of a charity dinner-dance at the Wentworth
and carrying off the trophy awarded to the
best jazz pair on the floor. And they sup-
plied two eneore whirls. Bridegroom Sid,
who did his bit as a British birdman, will
now tend his woolly flocks on his Point Cook
run.
Recurrence of an old trouble for which he
underwent an operation 13 years ago when
he was in the Bent Government forced Alec
Peacock to take a week’s spell just after
the Back-to-Creswick jamboree, in which he
was the central figure.
Adelaide’s little coo-ee i
Henley-tm-Tori-ens (d pity Australians impart so
little Originality into the haming bf their river
shivoos) was a crowded success. Gate money for
the reserve was only £250, but the mob quite
sanely argued “Why pay to go in the pen when
you can roam the rest of the riverside for nothing?”
The weather was made to order, and there was
plenty to watch on the water. The decorated boats
were beautiful, and Mesdames Maxwell Fowler, .1.
H. Gosse and Fotheringham found it a tough job
to adjudicate. The Original Ladies’ Rowing Club
bore off the prize. More packed crowds turned up
to see the illuminations and fireworks at night, and
Monday’s papers were so full of advts. for lost brace-
lets and brooches and things as to suggest that
whenever Miss Adelaide gets excited she scatters
her jewellery broadcast.
Four hundred-odd kiddies went to a Sunday-school
picnic at Ridge Park, Glen Osmond, the other day,
and early in the afternoon they began dropping like
ninepins. A doctor was sent for and the superin-
tendent walked round with bucketsful of salt and
Water, Which he administered ad lib. Nobody lost the
number of his mess, whatever else was jettisoned;
and now there’s a violent wrangle going on in the
dailies, the parents saying it was ptomaine from the
sandwiches cut the night before and the teachers
plumping for green ioquats.
Adelaide’s moneyed folk provided much blooming
Wealth at the Rhododendron Show in the Stirling
East Institute. V. Zed and W. H. Bagot carried off
most of the prizes. The former recently purchased
James Marshall’s house and grounds near Mount
Lofty station, originally the property of the late
R, A. Stock, who laid out the beautiful garden.
A large crowd went to the station to wish good
luck to the tennis players off to Melbourne for the
inter-State matches. It is a unique coincidence in
first-grade tennis that a mother should be captain
and first player in the ladies’ team and her son
captain and first player of the men. Mrs. W. T.
Rowe and her boy E.T. have gone in those roles.
On Thursday afternoon William Sowden opened the
24th annual Federal Exhibition of the Society of
Arts. The show boasted 239 exhibits, of which S.A.
contributed 166. For good little Adelaide there
was a surprising number of nudes, due apparently to
the Melrose Prize (£25) for the best figure-
drawing. But the award went to May Grigg for a
very excellent portrait of her father, the well-known
musician.
J. J. Virgo, C.8.E., hon. sec. of the British
Empire Y.M.C.A. Union, accompanied by Mrs.
Virgo, is on a brief visit to S.A. He was 14 years
general sec. in this town; in 1910 he became general
sec. bf the parent association in London, and during
the war was national field sec. of the Red Triangle.
Mrs. Virgo is the daughter of an Anglican clergy-
man, and the couple are on their honeymoon trip,
which started with a visit to Denmark.


Columbia
Will there be a
COLUMBIA GRAFONOLA
in Your Home This Xmas?
Note the name “COLUMBIA GRAFONOLA”—for the
COLUMBIA GRAFONOLA is not merely a talking-machine.
It is something more —VASTLY MORE.
It is the one perfect and unapproached
“Instrument of Reproduced Music’’ —per-
fect in tone, gloriously pure and crystal-
clear in its rendition of the singer’s voice
or the artist’s instrument, and possessing
every improvement that makes for reso-
nance and faithfulness to the original in
its reproduction.
And the last consideration —but by no
means the least — “Columbia Grafonolas”
never break down. In the course of years
the motor will wear, but so sturdily is it
built that use will not strain it, nor can
inexperienced people hurt it. You are
safest in purchasing a “Columbia
Grafonola” for these reasons.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Holeprof
Hostery
Henceforward Sister Ivellett will be chate-
liiine of Sydney Hospital, one of the two
biggest nursing jobs this city has to offer.
Of course, it was tipped that the Macciuarie-
street institution must be handed to the
care of one of that little band of eight who
with the first Expeditionary Eorce
from < Australia in 1914. Sister ‘ Kellett
served at the No. 2 A.G.H., Egypt, first as
theatre sister, later as matron, and then
English and French hospitals knew her care,
hhe was twice mentioned in despatches, is
an It.R.C. Ist class, and until the other day
was matron of Randwick Military Hospital.
Sister, started her career as probationer in
the wards she will now rule as matron.
Melba came back to Sydney on Saturday
night, and the Voice breathed over the usual
packed audience. The viee-regals were on
the carpet, and the way Dame Nellie gave
the glad eye to somebody in the front rows
would have been a scandal in anything less
than a D.B.E. “Green is for the Irish,”
the old baby-game tells us, but the Dame
wor ®,. lt: s P^ le d over with diamonds like
worldly dewdrops, but, as ever, kept the sad,
mad land miles away from her encore num-
bers. : Wouldn’t “Kathleen Mavourneen” now
come like a breath of sweetness if offered in-
stead of the eternal gorsey brae that she gives
»> f er final encore? Jennie Cullen, whose
fiddle had sung like a clear stream with
trout leaping in it, had “John Anderson,
My Jo. added to the programme for her
special delight, and she positively lapped it
up. And Verbrugghen, when he wasn’t in-
voking; the instruments to greater endeavor,
looked like a cat who has not only had his
fall of cream, but knows where to find an-
other bowl the minute he is ready for it.
The Tony Horderns have been keeping a
roof over Melba’s head until the vice-regal
return, and Dame Melba in all her travels
will scarcely have found greater beauty than
stretches before the lawns and terraces of
Retford Hall.
The wise women of the R.C. faith smiled
a little whimsical smile, in which there was
almost a wistful tenderness, when they had
their Archbishop’s Pastoral on present-day
lack of modesty in dress thundered at them.
Michael, by grace of God Archbishop of Syd-
ney, is a Saint of the recluse rather than the
militant type, or he would have noticed
that for nearly 12 months woman has been
covering more of herself from the public
gaze than she had done since the days of
Waterloo. What woman of fashion would
be seen dead now in a backless gown? Ninon
and georgette blouses are pooh-pooh (as the
lady who attends to the weekly wash trans-
lates taboo) for street wear; skirts are
creeping downwards; collars threaten to
envelop the ears. The only part greatly
exposed to the sun and breeze is the arm—
a thing that s all to the good, as this letter’s
neuritisy right hand can vouch. Really the
Vatican must appoint a sensible woman to
advise it in the Philosophy of the Fig Leaf.
Perhaps because of the vice-regal approval
bestowed on it, St. Luke’s has found favor
with the heavens. Scoring thereby the only
fine Saturday fnr weeks for its fete, Angli-
can Sydney was able to present its best frock
and brand of face powder to the grounds of
Retford Hall, the Tony Hordern home at
Darling Point. The gay stalls hugged the
shelter of the trees bordering the tennis-
courts. The slides didn’t do their usual brisk
business-—best garments may have had
something to do with it. “Oh,” exclaimed a
just-beginning father, “wouldn’t you like a
slide?” A pair of diminutive twins of about
four gave a bored look and replied on a
superior note: “No, thank you!” and the
just-beginning father blushed for his own
immaturity. At something after three Dame
Margaret sped the function with her
approval. The gaily-aproned small-girl
guard of honor, who had been on duty for
Clara Butt a week ago, were marshalled
once more by Mrs. Albert Littlejohn. This
time their trays were heaped with flowers,
so it was through an avenue of double sweet-
ness that Dame Margaret passed. Mrs. Tony
Hordern did the honors in a distracting com-
bination of topaz and amethyst—a frock of
yellow muslin topped by a hat of pale violet
tones. Small daughter Dinah presented the
usual floral offering to the viceroy’s lady
and amongst the buds who helped Mrs!
Swinson sell her wares were Daphne and
Diana Davidson.
. -*-^ e pen women of the city are busy boost-
ing an entertainment of their own. They
determined that the soldiers’ children
at Matraville shall have a grovn-in-fairyland
Christmas tree, so they are arranging a
matinee for December 12, at the Palace; and
the way in which the generous artists of
i | ai ‘ e offering their services is over-
whelming. E. J. Tait handed over the
theatre on behalf of the Firm with a glad
smile, Syd Day the Printer is making a
present of the programmes, and angelic is
the only way to describe Paling’s behavior.
Cheques have already begun to flutter in
and Pond’s are giving a box of silk stockings
to be raffled. Altogether the presswomen
are going to get as much joy out of the
entertainment as the kiddies whose dads were
crippled in the Great War.
The gay Vagabonds hung out their sign
at St. James’s three nights last week, and
Jerome’s absurdity, “Cook,” kept the house
laughing from the first word to the last
embrace. This is Sydney’s most famous
band of amateur playactors, and the total
they have raised for war funds and charity
is on nodding terms with Mt. Everest. Their
aim now is to become foster parents in per-
petuity of a Ren wick Hospital cot: they
have supported one for eight years, and are
into their fourth of the five hundred neces-
sary for a permanent endowment. Ruby
Coxliead s Cook and George Stokes’s John
1 arable would have been bright spots on
the professional stage; Ewart Jago, Ethel
Sparks and Valetta Cohen played a big part
in the quick-moving farce; and Muriel
Quelch, Jack Rogers, Noel Linton and Hugh
Donald speeded up the situations as a taxi-
driver’s ticker piles up the mileage.
The tiny Waitara foundlings benefit by the
mayoral lady’s party last week. In an
atmosphere heavy with black taffetas and
white kid gloves, banknotes piled up in
little drifts in front of guardian-angel Lay-
ton. The rather frail-looking Mrs. Lambert
wore a dress that was mostly delphinium-
blue transparence; and Motherhood Minis-
ter McGirr’s wife added weight to the party.
Aina Gordon played accompaniments for her
mamma, who sang the beauties of Ivillarney
with a Scotch brogue; and both ladies
trailed gorgeous matinee cloaks. Lilian Mit-
chell carolled a ballad or two, and Grace
Savile’s outsize contralto boomed like a
mellow gong in “An Eastern Prayer.”
Like the dove that Noah sent off from the
Ark, the committee of the Day Nursery
matinde fluttered about Her Majesty’s last
Thursday afternoon in vain search of a
spot to perch upon, for an enthusiastic
public had bought out the house. Reserved
seats at 10s. 6d. had appealed to every-
body’s fancy, and the theatre was blocked
with almost liquid humanity. The pro-
gramme had not a little to do with the
enthusiasm, and from the moment Fuller’s
Nine Wonders made the opening bow the
audience prepared to be satisfied. Generous
Gladys Moncrieft* came on twice, looking*
like a delectable sweet, and singing like an
angel; Maudie. Fane and Percy sent the
stock of “Theodore & Co.” flying upwards;
Alfred Frith, Arthur Stigant, Leslie Hol-
land and Frank Keenan were other fun-
makers, and Madge Elliott, Robert Chis-
hoim, Hector St. Clair, Cyril Ritchards,
Charlie Bryant and Ada Cerito helped to fill
the bill. What with programmes and sweets
and raffles and things, the takings are in
the neighborhood of a thousand pounds.
ril A on the roof of the Women’s Service
Club m Hunter-street, to be opened by Mrs
George Earp on Saturday, November‘26 is
bemg arranged by a. committee formed from
the ex-Clerical Women War-Workers. The
object is to raise a Christmas fund for the
men in Randwick Hospital, and for the wives
and children of disabled men out of hospital
Secretaries: E. Hale, Royal Chambers; I. R.
Huxley, Eldon Chamber's.
This is a picture of Ruby Rich, who used
to be Sidney’s child genius at the piano.
When she played
with the State
Orchestra a week
or two ago Sydney
audiences found all
the old charm with
the added technique
and culture of years
spent with the' best
masters of Europe.
Ruby is of the
moderns; even her
m usic is psycho-
analytical. She is
a great Feminist,
knows Freud back-
wards. and has a
magnolia-like skin
and a subtle taste
in millinery. Ber-
nice Agar made the
picture.
The refusal of “the Rajah”—colloquially
Sydney and Melbourne know only one—to
return to Pudukota, despite the alleged en-
treaties of his subjects, may not be wholly
unconnected with the slight put on his lialf-
Australian son. He knew before he mar-
ried Mollie Fink that none but a full-
blooded Indian could succeed him, and they
discussed the point freely in Sydney after
the boy arrived. The fact is' the' Ranee
hates India, where her social status is equi-
vocal and she is in constant peril of being
poisoned ; while the Rajah is more London
clubman than Oriental potentate. And the
life suits his wife very well, too. He would
be wealthy if his allowance from the Brit-
ish Government lapsed to-morrow: he has
greatly improved his personal fortune dur-
ing the last few years.
When Principal Scott-Fletcher’s daughter
Ida announced her engagement to L. H. Foote
one night last week, the shout that went up
from the students of Wesley College nearly
rent the veil of the Uni. in twain. A sneecli
being insistently called for, Ida appeared on
the balcony of her dad’s home, a modern
Juliet hanging on to mamma’s hand. The
husband-to-be hails from Ipswich (Q.).
Let us introduce Erna Living, the lady
who made such a profound impression at the
recent Repertory
performances by her
interpretation o f
Mrs. Lemmy in Gals-
worthy’s “Founda-
tions.” But she con-
siders that by far her
best work was as an
old hag, Liberty, in
a one-act play,
“Footprints,” writ-
ten around the
French Revolution,
and produced by a
suburban amateur
cast of six ladies.
So unusual was her
make-up in the last
show that many
amongst those
who saw the produc-
tion will be surprised to see the youthful
face and shoulder here presented. Erna was
born on the Clarence Hirer. She is devoted
to animals, is very keen on writing and
swimming, hut wishes to heartily devote her
life to the stage.
George Step, the tall, dark young man
who used to ornament the French Consu-
late, and has lately taken his Apollo profile
and agile brain to the service of the Mes-
sageries Maritimes, entered into matrimony
last week, his bride being Thelma Marie
Gilles, and the secluded church of St.
Joseph, at Woollahra, the spot chosen for
the nuptials. Thelma Marie took the plunge
in the softest of white satin veiled in silver
tissue, with soft layers of old lace over
that. Two bridesmaids, Dorothy Ruthe and
Brenda Mitchell, and a diminutive train-
bearer, Helen Westcott, added blue and
silver touches to the picture. The party
was held at Malvern, the bride’s home, Mrs.
Giljes extending the smile of welcome to'
nearly a hundred guests, among whom were
the French Consul-General Campana couple.
Pretty Mrs. “Mollie” Dangar got the
usual restitution decree from Leonard Dan-
gar on Monday. He is a member of the
Henry Dangar family, and has big squatting
interests. . She was an Anderson, also of
sheep-raising stock.
Haagen Holenbergh, the pianist, is con-
templating another tour of Asia. Travel is
his hobby. He has an intimate acquaint-
ance with the literature of four or five
languages, and seems to love the folk-lore of
them all equally; and he is that rare bird, a
good raconteur.
On November 19 Mrs. W. B. Jones, of
£oint Piper, entered upon her 96th year,
90 of which she has spent in Australia.' She
is a sister of the late John Dawson, a soli-
citor who—a coincidence—was admitted to
practice on Nov. 3.9, 1846. For many years
Mrs. .Tones lived in Melbourne, but for the
past lo has watched the Harbor spread
out its treasures of emerald and opal.
The local tenor had been handed so many
bouquets that the incense had gone to his
head, and when he was asked to make one
of an operatic company performing in a
country town he agreed, but turned up on
the opening night with but the vaguest idea
of his lines. One of the ladies in the cast
who knew the onera through fed him almost
word by word. The tenor was quite pleased
with himself till next morning, when the
Cowanhyde newspaper critic remarked:
“The most interesting part of the perform-
ance was the duet between the tenor and
the prompter.”
The Summer Girl in the bravery of a
blue embroidered frock and a Ma Mie
Rosette ninon veil walked into the bank and
took her stand at the counter beside one of
the fat white pillars. Just as she was ex-
pecting to be attended to, a large man en-
tered the bank and pushed into position
ahead of her. Being enraged, she spoke
to the young man behind the counter, saying
in a clear voice: “Give me a cheque-book,
please.” He stopped with liis hand poised
over the large man’s papers, cast a
®Y er ,, the large man’s shoulder,
d . blankly at her and replied
wait a minute, lass!” The tempera-
tuie was up in the hundreds, but
Wm^l nR e man . W^ S hit b y a voice like the
wpfp v !,° a n iceberg: “I beg your pardon,
! peakln S to me?” "Fill in the

tlmdnthtood-f le T l l was telling the fellow on
t ie other side of the pillar to wait a minute.
Vr u- e w ’? rks bene, and his name is Lasker !”
Jia Mie Rosette wasn’t a bad sort: she eon-
ded a giggle to the book in which she put
her signature, and assured the almost-col-
lapsed youth that all was well.
Jt happened in a North Shore tram. Mrs.
iVewrich was paying 2d. for a ride, but it
was quite obvious from her get-up that it
was only because the family chauffeur was
NewrVi a da f.f: With her was Master
£e\\ rich, aged d, just as expensively clad as
mu. At the lirst stop, enter the drunk. He
surveyed his fellow-passengers through a
haze and took a fancy to the youngster, in
spite of the mother’s icy disdain. Fumbling
in Ins pocket he produced a newspaper par-
cel which, upon being unwrapped, disclosed
two pigs trotters. One he handed to Master
Newnch as one conferring a ten-and-six-
penny box of chocolates. The infant’s ple-
beian tastes asserted themselves, and he
grabbed the trotter with great joy. Mrs
Newnch was at first petrified, but, recover-
ing herself and grabbing the trotter from the
clasp of her small son, tried to return it to
the drunk. In vain. He was politely in-
sistent that he had (riven it to the child and
would not hear of its being returned. So
there was Mrs. Newrich dangling a pig’s
trotter between thumb and forefinger At
last a brain-wave reached her, and she fired
the horror out on to the road and herself
hopped out at the next stop—presumablv to
cool off in a water-trough.
A Maoriland passport-clerk was recently
handed an application by a lady who was
pioud of her luxuriant locks. In answer to
the question, Any peculiarities?” she wrote
Hair below knees.” When she got her
passport she found this interesting item
liftcl bC'GD abbreviated to 4< JTuzzy legs!”
The dances of the week at the Wentworth
were the Pierrot revel in aid of the amuse-
ment fund at the Waterfall Sanitarium, and
the Rosebank College dance held on Fridav
night. ■
A Brisbane postscript:—
The newest engagement concerns Beryl Wonderley
a pietty Toowoomba girl, and Jim Kemp, a returned
soldier, and son of Mrs. Kemp, of Moolabah station.
Two other recent promisers are Alice Hart, lately of
Glennie School, to Guy King, and Dorothy Scott, of
Mt. Dawson, to Fred King. The two young men
are sons of the late-of-Gowrie Kings, and wore khaki.
Dame Clara and her husband were the guests of
his Ex. at luncheon, and Major-Gen. ar.d Mrs. Bruche
and Mr. and Mrs. George Sampson were there to meet
them. The lorkshire Society tea-ed the pair in
I' inney o roof garden. The white rose of York
bloomed on the tables, and gum-leaves and native
bears added local color. Mrs. Harper presided.
A gorgeous garment of ivory brocaded satin, cob-
webbed in silver, draped Dame Clara on Saturday
night at her first concert. She sported also a dia-
mond tiara and pendant, and her order. His Ex.
was in one of the boxes, with Capt. and Mrs. Parsons
and Dr. and Mrs. Espie Dods. At the next concert
the statuesque dame was in draperies of georgette, in
shades of eau-de-nil, moonlight blue and delphinium
blue. A tunic worked in diamente embroidery, and
a bodice of dark-blue velvet, also embroidered, made
the singer look like a starry night.
It was hard luck that the Sampson Orchestral
Society clashed with a Butt-Rumford concert; never-
theless the Exhibition Hall was filled. His Ex.
patronised the Orchestra, with Capt. Frank Hammond
A.D.C.-ing.
The street collections for St. Martin’s Hospital on
Armistice Day resulted in over £5OOO flowing out
of General Public’s pockets. At night a benefit
performance for the same object was held at Cremorne,
and another couple of hundred were wheedled from
the old warrior. Among the audience was new
Archbishop Sharp, though he was only an arch-elect
then. Dame Clara Butt sent an apology and £lO,
which was very sporting of her.
Bobby Kaye, who is not only a teacher of singing,
but a fine organist, has been accompanying Dame
Clara on the organ, and adding another sprig or two
to the wreath he wears so unconsciously. Bobby
trained John Ralston, Lou Vernon and hosts of other
well-known singers, and was never known to con-
sider such a sordid thing as a fee when he had found
a voice worth training.
A couple of hundred guests surged over Govern-
ment House lawns when his Ex. gave the last garden-
party of 1921. He is seeking cooler lodgings in
Toowoomba for the summer.
Sydney Ure Smith pioneered one-man etching
shows in Brisbane last week, when the walls of the
Sheldon Gallery in Preston House were hung with 24
examples of his work. The gallery is a venture of
Jeanette Sheldon, and she purposes to use it for
the display and sale of Australian art only. Next
month she stages a show of the Australian Painter-
Etchers’ Society.

she’ll iron in cool comfort and convenience. She’ll finish her ironing
earlier. There’ll be no after-ironing tiredness; in short, ironing

Then there are two other things it’s worth your while considering:—
One: Dinner will always be on time on ironing day as other days—
prepared with the care she likes to give it if the minutes permit;
and, two, your shirts, etc., will be ironed even better than thev
are now.

Teelieedee: It’s ingenious enough to make
us expect better things from you. . . .Tomly: Don't we
think Australians can do anything? Yes, we think
they coukl do something besides borrow and loaf if
they tried.... Home: Blank verse isn’t so easy as that
• ...Nickedy Hli: The interesting spot is where you
scratched the worms away to get at your dead love.
• • F L -B- : Not up to the mark L.W. (Carlton) :
“The Deceiver” has more imagination in it than an
empty wheelbarrow; hut we wouldn’t care to go
much further than that Sadie U.: You’re quite
right—night doesn’t often last into the next day.
....Lance J.: “Kate” held for inquest.... Habet:
These verses don’t strike us, but you can do better. ...
U.M.C.: Not up, but with a hint of quality
Paula: The roses and raptures can’t be written like
telegrams without the necessary article before the
noun A.B.N.: Doesn’t get anywhere near
E.J.R.: Very bad Mort: All there words and not
a clear statement about anything. .. .Bellerive: This
is a special sample and must go in with all the
frills:—
CHEESE JUMPERS.
Wrong is the naturalist who argues there’s no
poesy in cheese-jumpers. For art’s sake I’ll prove it.
They hop o’er your plate,
And go as you please.
The little white jumpers
Whom live in old cheese.
Some people loathe ’em,
And others don’t care
If they swallow a mouthful.
The truth I declare.
They hop, twist and leap,
And go as you please,
The jumpers, white jumpers,
Whom live in old cheese.
«. M.H.M.: No use... .Gist: What is it all about?
.. . .S.S. (Hardwick) : It isn’t much of a yarn and
the telling heightens the improbability. . . .Ken K.:
Could all have been said better in six sentences....
E.W. (Leichhardt): It has a sporting cliance....
Northerner: Not well enough done. .. .C.D.: “Con-
certs” not up to standard.... Frank H.: Nothing in
it. . . .L.N.C. (Dalby) : Those “Roads” don’t lead to
“yellow meads of asphodel”... .A. G.J.: Your sonnets
haven’t the concentration and thought-movement to
justify the form.... Ethel W.: “The Pilgrim” seems
to hop on one leg 4 . .. .A.A.K.: Well enough done, but
this is a poor market for such goods... .L.L. (Bur-
wood): Too thin. .. .B.H.: Not enough in “Loneli-
ness” ... .C.J.S.: Your people seem to be about as
serious in their love affairs as dairy cows Reg
F.: None of them get near... .Mary: Better grow
up; but you’ll have to grow in imagination as well
as inches S.W.G.H.: “The Bush Blacksmith”
makes a noise like somebody tearing up tin :—
’Way in the mallee where the night-birds cry,
Where the frogs croak the big creek by;
Where his home is guarded by the moon’s bright eye,
There dwells the brawny smith with his daughter
shy ;
And he fears not to do or die,
But makes ring, and sing, and sigh ;
And the flames flare, and the sparks fly,
I owe no man (quoth he) no, not I.
For I do my sixteen hours a day,
Kneading the iron by the moon’s'pale ray:
1 ’m up by the light of the morning gray,
When the hares love to frisk and play;
An hour before breakfast, come who may,
Called by the mocks of the jack and the jay;
I care not for fight or fray
But I protect my own and pay my way.
....Spencer C.: Rather a dreary narration....
M.R.B.: Very tedious.... Dora E.: No use to us....
Donald M.: Ditto... .H.V.P.: The verse is too slight.
.... Poneke: The ground has been well trodden ; and
the verse is too rough, anyway Stronach: Not
enough in the yarn. . . . D.S.C.: One encouraging
stanza: —
If we are conscientious, in thought and deed,
We do the work and sow the seed,
We shall reap in the end what we desire
And are bound to emerge from out of the mire.
For whate’er we live for, if our efforts are true,
Success we will gain after failures gone through.
• . . .F.S. (Inglewood) : “Tragedy” is only had prose-;
the other is better jingle, hut the matter is common-
place. . ..E.R.G.: It starts with a flicker, but gets
darker and emptier ao it goes on. .. .Gordon D.; Pity
to waste effort on weary imitations of the sort of
thing that died 40 years ago of its own falsehood. . . .
E.J.L.; Suffers from pernicious anaemia. .. .R.R.D.:
Doesn’t strike us.... Reg F.: Not enough in any of
them, and too many tag lines. . . .H.K.B.: Dislike Olga
and her bad temper. . . .F.M.C.: As emptj r as a poet’s
pocket.... L. A. R.R.: No use. .. .George C.: No use
transcribing portions of works on geography and
travel and rolling them out • thin... .Barwon: It
doesn’t arrive. . . .Stitch: Yanko doesn’t so much want
more water as less red tape... . I.W.S.: Cut out the
grace and come at once to the corned beef and
carrots.... Rebus: No doubt the poet did it himself.
He’s a poor poet who is quite satisfied with his stuff
when he sees it in print. In the case you mention the
second thought was certainly the best. .. .Beth:: Your
ear is out of tune....Rad: No, why should we?....
D.W.N.: Straighten out your thoughts before you
get pen and paper. You repeatedly go back on your
tracks to complete a point you’ve half-made before.
. ...Kopp: They’re- all judged on their interest....
B.D.L.: Too confused ; "try to simplify it.... Jaded:
Can do nothing with stuff so closely typed... .J.D.:
You take too long to tell it....Kem: Just plain
libel... .E.M.F.: Matter well handled, but someone
jumped in ahead.... Var: Boom-soon, ideas-over-
seers, aldermen-them, next-best —what sort of an
ear have you got ?. .. . N.Z. Country Girl: That note
of yours is a little bit of blue sky in a grey day. . . .
L.N.C.: Well enough done; but a thousand other
sleepless poets have done it in their tossings...,
Janus: Too little in it.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J.W.S.: Try to develop a freer, broader style....
R.C.: Variation of old joke. . . .S.V.M.: Crude draw-
ing... .R.H.M.: Not up W.D.: Those girls’ legs
testify to either a delicate up-bringing or an amazing
lack of observation. .. .Aldred: Using as suggestion;
forward name and address... .J.B.: Promising, but
below par yet C.C.: Weak in drawing.... M.B.:
Too wooden E.A.D.: An awesome effort....
Max: Nothing in it... .H.S.K.: Misses C.G.: Get
into touch with one of the recognised art classes....
Monty: A glimmer of promise D.I.M.: Joke not
worth it.
“The Schoolie”: In 1862 a party of
Cousin-Jack miners travelling from the
Ovens (Vie.) to the Lambing-Flat rush were
bailed up by Ben Hall’s gang with “Your
money, or we’ll blow your brains out.” “Blow
away, m’son,’’ said Johnny Johns, the Cor-
nishmen’s leader; “may as well go Lambin’
Flat wi’out brains as wi’out monay,”

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
f HE only tree on the countryside was
I by the creek, which was quite dry
*- and waterless. Under it, near their
motor-car, sat the Three Wise Travellers,
grave bushmen in moleskins, with sun-
bleached wisps of moustaches. To their
right was desolation linking hands behind
them with the desert. In front was Gobi,
to their left Sahara. And it was four
o’clock in the morning and they were about
to have their breakfast. The sun, of course,
had not fully risen, but, as often happens
in the inlands in late autumn, over every-
thing hung a cold, half-permeable mist
through which you saw far-off objects as
grotesque mirages or shapeless bulks, whose
distance you could not very easily ®J- U ge.
A healthy smell of grilling chop filled the
air, and all the impedimenta of mealtime had
just been laid out, with much chinking, on
an oilcloth, when the first beam of real sun-
light swept across the heavens. Rising
with it out of the east came a phantom
but nebulous mastodon walking, upside down
in the clouds on drunken stilts with. an
accompanying Shape. The Shape might
have been a giant baboon,, or a ptero-
dactyl or a diprotodon; in fact, any-
thing not of this world and season. Behind
this pair were more mastodons, and presently
a veritable elephantine, ballet was perform-
ing in the sky, sometimes wrong s:de up,
sometimes right side up, sometimes on one
plane and sometimes on another, but always
a little amorphous. , , , ~
The Three Wise Travellers watched the
naaeant unmoved. They had seen it all
before and were thinking of their breakfast,
but one of them the driver, who was
looked on-bv h’s friends. as a talkative per-
son, and, therefore, a bit unmannerly, un-
loosed his tongue to say: “That’ll be Yus-
suf.'’ And after t&at he looked very much
ashamed of his garrulousness, and confined
his attention to the johnny-cake he was
cooking in the ashes, until Yussuf appeared,
followed by seven camels of petulant mien,
on the last of which was mounted a spare
little man with very red hair.
The camels, with one accoid, sat dowm as
the caravan stopped. With one accord they
gave voice to their disapproval of the whole
universe. The Little Man dismounted. The
camel driver said several words to him in
a foreign language, which nobody, except
the camels possibly, understood; but they
sounded very potent words —the kind of
words that suggest unmentionable ancestries,
bowstrings ■on the Bosphorus, and presage
cut throats and boiling oil for somebody.
He looked fiercely at the Little Man and the
Little Man grinned. Then he said some
more things and spoke to his camels. Where-
upon the camels rose up on the stilted legs
with as much effort as if they had each been
loaded down with all the crimes of Tartary,
and the cavalcade strode or waddled off, each
according to its gait, leaving the Little Man
behind with the Three Wise Travellers.
Then the sun came out of the mist with
startling suddenness and the fog lifted, heel-
ing over in white, whirling clouds, and the
whole landscape was on view. You took in
its features in a second. There were the
Travellers and their car. There was the
solitary tree and the solitary creek which
swept away for 128 miles to the plain’s only
other arboreal decoration. To the south-
west, the only two landmarks between the
Travellers and the Northern Territory bor-
der, were the Little Man and a post which
held a mail-box 58 miles beyond him. All
around was plain upon which the newly-
come morning breeze was starting a myriad
little roly-poly bushes on their journey
southward. For all the world they looked
like small yellow poicupines as they bowled
along with the wind, seeking for a fence to
pile up against. . , ,
The Three Travellers were more interested
in the Little Man than in the other features
of the landscape. They looked at him with
discernment but without inquisitiveness.
They had their own feelings and they re-
spected his, but they saw enough to become
aware that his hair was redder even than it
had seemed at first glance; that his skin,
naturally pink, was of a curious whiteness;
that his eyes had a strange stare which im-
mediately suggested hunger; that he wore
a long black clerical coat four sizes too large
for him, and an imposing episcopal hat with
a cockade which, though it would have digni-
fied the Archbishop of York, lent him a
ribald, low-comedy air. Nevertheless, he
was for all the marks of tribulation upon
him, curiously alert. And a more unrespect-
able person it would have been hard to nrci
despite the Anglican habiliments, for he wore
no collar, and one had a pained suspicion,
from the hang of the imposing coat at the
shoulders, that there was no other garment
underneath. ,„ . . ~, Mon
“Might I ask,” inquired the L’ttle jw ,r >
softly, “if any of you three gentlemen are
of the police?” , . , .
The Travellers shook their heads.
“Verv well, then,” said the Little Man,
evidently relieved and becoming suddenly at
his ease. “Very well, then. We will pro-
ceed with our meal.” And with that he sat
down, p’tcliforked a chop off the grid ron
with amazing dexterity, dropped it into his
hot to cool, and recited with an air of great
piety : —• , ,
“Twice five’s as good as ten.
Wire in—Amen.”
With that he reached for a johnny-cake and
began to eat ravenously. The Three Tra-
vellers also began to eat,. and one of them
poured him out some tea in a pannikin.
When >ou live in a country where you
sometimes walk 40 miles for a drink ot
water and then find a- dead wallaby or a
dead man or nothing at all but hard mud
in the waterhole, nothing astonishes you.
They were accustomed to the vagaries ot
hungry and thirsty men. And this was a
hungry man. He piled the food into him-
self with an astonishing rapidity. Eating
was more like a conjuring trick than a meal
with him. He fairly perspired with the
exertion of mastication; but as the chops
and the johnny-cake and the golden syrup
and the tea disappeared down his pulsat ng
throat, there came into _ his face a joyous
expression of rascality mingling with a wag-
gish assurance. The look of hunger went
out of his eyes; the color came back to his
face, and when he had finally finished his
meal (the slower bushmen were still at work
on their second chops) he wiped his mouth
on his coat-tail and beamed radiantly on
the company. • , . . ,
“Ah dinner, dinner! he exclaimed,
“what a thing it is in this world! You talk
of ability as the motive power of progress!
But what is ability ? Nothing but the chance
to command food. What is the basis of suc-
cessful love? Being able to fill up a silly
little minx with more chocolates thein nil
the other boys. What is at the bottom of
politics? Banquets. Hungry fellers by the
dozen stoking up like a lot of carpet-snakes
and someone ripping ’em up with flattery
while they are sleeping it off. And murder.
Married gentleman looks at his wife and
says to himself : *ls this whnt I feed • nnd
reaches for his axe. Then”— —
The Little Man stretched out his I ‘ft
foot, three toes of which protruded through
his boot, and gave a realistic imitation ot
the lady’s death throes.
“It’s funny how it works out, though,
he proceeded. “I don't say, of course, that
the food acts of itself. You have to com-
bine it with circumstances, like we used to
mix up hydrogen and oxygen when I was
at school. Your food needs a starter, just
like cream when it’s being turned into
cheese.
“I had lots of food before three weeks
ago, but it was only three weeks ago that
it really started me on my upward way. In
fact, it never did anything very much for
me until I disagreed about it with the over-
seer at Tululu Downs. You see, he refused
to vive me any. And I”
“Eh?” cried the Three Wise Travellers
with one voice, startled by this apparent
flagrant breach of the laws of inland hospi-
tality. “Do you mean to say that someone
wouldn’t give you a b'r of damper and beef
when you asked for it?”

AT HOME-AT WORK-& AT PLAY.
There never has been a greater need than
to-day for the prompt and efficient First-aid
treatment of Everyday Accidents and Skin
Troubles, and among' all the
discoveries of new methods of
treatment Zam-Buk stands out
as universally successful.
Zam=BuK is quite different
from ordinary ointments, and
results show that its healing
virtues are superlative.
When Zam-BuK is promptly
applied to a cut or laceration of
the sKin it ensures disinfection
of the wound, and destroys the
numerous germs whose formid-
able and rapid reproduction is
so dangerous.
If poisonous microbes Have started a
festering in a cut or sore, Zam-Buk im-
mediately lessens the pain, subdues the
suppuration, abates the inflammation,
and hastens complete recovery.
usefulness of is proved
daily in thousands of Australian Homes.
Zam-BuK is not Only a wound cleanser
and disease-destroyer, but it isolates the inner
tissues from infection, and quickens the regen-
eration and Healing ofthe damaged flesh.
1 hese unique qualities, coupled witH
its Handy, convenient and ever-ready char-
acter, stamp Zam-Buk as the indispensable
Healer to be kept Handy in every Home.
FOOT GASHED BY A PLOUGH BLADE.
“While playing my little girl Rose caught her foot on
the blade of a plough, receiving a bad wound, which bled very
much, says Mrs. Mc-Reynolds, 41 Francis Street, Glebe Sydney
"Atter bathing the foot I promptly applied Zam-Buk, and m
a little while the wound had healed splendidly. Some time
atter she. gashed her other foot on a piece of rusty tin and
although the wound had become festered, Zam-Buk drew out
all matter, and then healed the wound up perfectly.”
SCALDED WITH BOILING LIQUID.
"Through upsetting a bowl of boiling starch my foot was
badly scalded, writes Mrs. L. Diercke, of 50 Mun'roe Street
Melbourne. 1 Great blisters formed, and these bursting two
days later left the flesh dreadfully raw and inflamed. The
doctor supplied me with lotions and ointments, too painful to
use, however.
“Even the first dressing of Zam-Buk took pain out of the
foot wonderfully. Systematic use of this balm soothed
purified and healed the scalds thoroughly.
New skin grew, and my foot was made
quite sound and strong again.”
CRUSHED HAND & PILES CURED.
“My right hand was crushed by a log.
and the little finger split to the bone.”
says Mr. Simpson, of Annerley Road, S.
Brisbane. “Fortunately, I was persuaded
to try Zam-Buk, which so perfectly healed
the finger that there was scarce a mark
to be seen.”
“For five years I tried scores of
remedies in search of a cure for piles.
The first time I applied Zam-Buk the
ease it brought was remarkable. Zam-
Buk proved a real cure.”
CUT KNEE & SKINNED LEG.
Mrs. Medley, of 241 Pirie Street,
Adelaide, says:—“Jean, mv little girl,
has had sores through falling and taking
the skip off her legs, and in other ways.
I applied Zam-Buk, and it is remarkable
bow auickly they were healed. Mv little
boy, Henry, had a bad cut on his knee.
I bathed it, then applied Zam-Buk, and
he was soon running around perfectly
cured.”
There’s nothing like Zam-Buk for Cuts,

beef ? cried the Little Man scornfully. "I
wouldn’t argue about things like that when
I could get some from someone else by walk-
ing 10 miles 0 r so! No fear! This was
something different. Brandy, as a matter
ot tact, and the only bottle thereabouts •
and, what made it worse, he was keeping it
for Christmas. If I’d known that he’d
get vindictive about it, like he did, and turn
the whole police force of the North-West—
both of them—on to my tracks. I’d have
thought twice about it.”
T e e ,i Little iAlun adjusted his bootlaces
carefully.
“Well, you can’t foresee everything,” he
said with a sigh. "I’ve been hunted down
the Roper and hounded through the long-
grass country. I’ve crossed the Leichhardt
with me toes curling up under me in fear
that I might tread on a crocodile. I’ve been
bitten by a mosquito an inch and a half
across, and there’s an old Mary 300 miles
trom here who nearly married me—only I
ran away from her in a thunderstorm when
friends were afraid to face the
debbil-debbils. And then a sneaking black-
guard of a dingo ate my clothes while I
was drying them afterwards.
“What I’d have done after that.” he eon-
Unued, “if l hadn’t come across the old
Bishop in camp I’m hanged if I know. I’d
like to have heard the old boy when he
Jound his trousers were gone, and it would
have been rather fetching to see him mak-
ing_ his triumphal entry into Borrooloola.
Lh i But, anyhow. I hope lie’s grateful to
me. I left him his shirt and his lingerie,
you know —and I needn’t have. I could
have done with a shirt, but I always was
kind hearted.
After I got these clothes my luck seemed
to change. There was water every 10 miles
and it seemed to be no time before I hit
the plains. I tell you. gentlemen, Captain
Cook standing on the Peak of Darien was
nothing to me when I saw these rolv-polv
plains. Heavens!” •
The story paused while the narrator dealt
discreetly with a prying ant. Then he pro-
ceeded :
“The only thing that worried me was
what I should do. I was feeling convales-
cent, so to speak, after all that trip, and I
wanted to be luxurious and lazv. So I
looks over my capital. Item one: Large
bottle of overproof brandy. Item two: One
clerical suit. And I says to mys If: ‘Friend,
there is only one thing for you to do. Here
you are arrayed like the Queen of Sheba
in an ecclesiastical costume. If you tell the
honest inhabitants of this region that it
was given to you they won’t believe you.
J'-n/o, you’ll have to tell them that it’s yours
and that you are. entitled to wear it. And
if you aren’t entitled to wear it. you’ll have
to make yourself entitled, and suffer what
is known as inspirational conversion. You
must choose a territory and be Bishop of it.'
“So then I stands up and savs: ‘Know
all you territories from. Alligator Creek ou
the north to Ryan’s mail-box on the south,
and the Border on the west and away to
glory on the east, that I am your bishop .and
that I have annexed yon from the Bishop
of Cassowaria, whose pants I also have and
am now wearing.’ Taen 1 takes the cork
out of the bottle. ’Your health, Bishop!’ 1
mvsel’ uuikes for liyan’s to introduce
, " A , f f er . th «t everything went quite eoni-
ortably. I had a flock of two Irish
-Methodists and another gentleman who said
ne duln t know quite what he was, and a
Chinaman named Kum Soon, and two stock-
“? en ; . they found 1 had that bottle
\ i a , tOO < m 3'. word about being a bishop.
Altogether our little gatherings were rather
merry. lou see, we each had to travel a
long way to meet, and we used to be very
thirsty when we arrived. But, my brethren,
in the beginning I had shown the greatest
foresight, the very greatest foresight, in
putting the contents of my bottle in an
outirum and adding to it yeast and some
tobacco and a pound or two of rice. And
from that I made an excellent brew—dull
of blue things, with 27 legs some of them,
and while it lasted I was most popular,
indeed, ll I may say so, the most popular
man m the district,
"But in the end the heathen beat me—
he found my plant. lie eruelled my pitch
He became intoxicated, the vile fellow, and
poured all my beautiful vintage into the
ireek so that the fishes came to the surface
and—but I see, gentlemen, that lam strain-
ing your credulity.
"The point is that friendship and kindness
are evanescent things when unsupported bv
material benefits. With brandy all my con-
gregatmn accepted me as a bishop. Without
it they handed me over to that camebdriver
and told him to take care of me because I
nad a thousand pounds in my coat tails.
■ , that s why Yussuf and me weren’t
looking quite friends when we arrived. I’ve
h. three days on that disreputable bactrian,
afraid to eat for fear our friend should
poison me for the money I didn’t have, arid
having to wake up every hour or so at night
and feel my carotid artery.
"But never mind,” lie concluded. “I have
11 ad a good breakfast. When do we start?”
len hours later the Three Wise Travel-
ers parted from the Little Man in Tooloom,
which looks like a cathedral city on the
map and like five iron shanties in reality,
ihey gave him advice and they gave him
flour and tea. They handed him a little
brown sugar and forced golden syrup on
him. And then they wished him a brief
farewell and watched him go.
Presently, when he was out of sight down
on the river, the Little Man sat down for
a HiV > al i &ave himself over to meditation.
, • D ?? 1 people beat y° u •” he said to
Himself. Those chaps knew wlmt kind I
was and yet they load me up like this. I
eouldn t have got that breakfast even in
Geelong, much less the groceries.”
The Three Wise Travellers, who at that
moment were Camping down a mile away,
were not saying anything. They expected to
live a long time and felt that words were
precious—far more precious than kind deeds
even in a country where you see only one
stranger to speak to in a year.
EL VERDUGO.
Interlude.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A WINDOW-PANE and approximately
100 feet of vacant atmosphere gave
the group in the street below an odd
effect of being in a different world, or the
creatures of a dream. They were silent
players moving upon a muddy screen.
The blackfellow stepped on to this screen
through the swing-doors of the pub. He
was a little man with a red handkerchief
about his neck, and a broken boxer hat, and
strange trousers that looked as though they
were worn wrong way round. He had two
stockwhips on his crooked arm. With a
slight lurch he took off his coat and laid it
down thoughtfully in the mud. Thirty-two
newspaper boys sprang up from nowhere and
surrounded him in a gesticulating ring. The
man with the barrow was so engrossed that
he spat upon his little terrier, missing the
orange he was polishing by several inches.
His professional pride seemed to be out-
raged at the mischance and he kicked the
little dog. It ran away mournfully and lay
down beneath the water trough.
After making sure that his coat was rest-
ing firmly in the mud, the blackfellow pro-
duced a piece of paper from his trouser
pocket and wound a strip into a spool. He
held it in his left hand, and chopped it in
halves with his snaky whip. Seven office
boys joined the 32 newsvendors, and the
little circle swayed with excitement and jab-
bered in dumb snow. An old lady in goloshes
nodded her bonnet disapprovingly. The man
forgot his barrow and wandered across, but
the little dog still rested beneath the horse
trough.
The swing-doors performed again and pro-
jected the young man under the influence on
to the screen. Even in the theatre of life
the cost of programmes is prohibitive these
days, and there was no means of telling
whether the young man was professionally
associated with Othello. He trampled down
a number of newsboys and joined him, how-
ever.
The young man held out an appealing
hand for the ill-fated spool of paper, and
the ring trembled. The aboriginal “star”
was in a petulant mood. He picked
his coat up out of the mud and put it on.
Tile assistant shrugged his shoulders to indi-
cate his lack of interest and sat down in
the gutter, whereupon the dark gentleman
took off his coat and put it down in the mud.
He wound another spool with pomp. The
young man swayed towards him with his
hand stretched out in an appeal which would
have touched any heart other than that of
a savage. The savage merely waved the
hand and the young man away, and pro-
ceeded to snip the paper in twain with his
delinum-tremens whip. The young man
wept.
But the blood of his Caucasian forebears
told and he rose somewhat steadily and
marched to the coat of Othello. Othello saw
the move and executed a strategic stagger,
ending up with both feet firmly planted
in the mud, The - young man stood on the
coat also. They went through the forms of
heated debate.
The old lady shook her bonnet again and
went hurriedly round the corner.
The 200 newsvendors and office youths
selected champions and barracked in dumb
show. The disputants took it in turns to
thrust out their faces at each other, but both
stood firmly upon the coat. The young man’s
hat fell off, and a motor-car coming down the
hill ran over it in preference to 39 news
merchants. The man from the barrow spat
philosophically into the horse trough. The
dog beneath quailed visibly. It was evident
that he feared the man from the barrow
might miss the trough.
A large policeman ploughed slowly through
the foam of small boys, the bow of his
stomach thrusting them aside in a rippling
wave. He joined the star actors. There
was not much room left on the coat, but he
managed to get a corner. The three com-
pletely hid the coat now beneath the carpet
of their feet.
The large policeman put his stomach be-
tween the out-thrust faces and waved his
vast hand at the circle of 756 youths and
one man with his arm in a sling. The man
went away slowly, as though he had looked
upon wonders, but the 983 boys made no
attempt to follow his good example. One
of them, however, stole a bad orange from
the barrow and fled down the street. Per-
haps it is Providence which guides the hand
of bad boys to the one bad orange.
Using his stomach as a-flail the large
policeman thrashed the disputants apart,
and bumped them uncertainly but inevitably
into the froth of 1175 small boys. The little
old lady came back with a larger and fatter
policeman, the sweep of whose progress
through the sea of boy set up waves which
propelled the black face and white face
within scowling distance again.
A smaller boy picked up one of the black
man s whips and cracked it, with the result
that an electric eel coiled round his own
legs and those of four smaller boys. They
danced in the mud.
Each of the large policemen put his
stomach behind one of the disputants and
butted him through the sea of 1217
youths. Just as they reached the outskirts
there was further dumb discussion, and the
black man went back and dug his coat out
of the mud and put it on with the air of one
who thinks deeply. The young man put the
rim of his hat over his ear, and went round
the corner. Trailing a whip in either hand
Othello lurched round the other.
The policeman made cabalistic signs over
the heads of 1416 office boys, the little old
lady and the barrowman, and the muddy
screen was depopulated.
The policemen passed through the swing-
doors. The barrowman selected another
orange, and his aim was unfailing. All
that remained of the interlude was the crown
of the young man’s hat.
