Anzacian Verse
KILLED, IN ACTION.
Where the ranges throw their shadows long
before the day’s surrender,
Down a valley ivhere a river used to
tumble to the sea,
On a rising patch of level rest the men who
dared to tender
lAfe and all its sweetness for their love of
liberty.
In a thousand miles of ugly scrubby waste
and desolation, t
Just that little space of level showing open
to the seaj
Nothing there to lend it grandeur (sure, it
needs no decoration)
Save those rows of wooden crosses keep-
ing silent custody.
There’s a band of quiet workers, artless lads
who joked and chatted
Just this morning; note they’re sullen and
they keep their eyes away
From the blanket-hidden body, coat and
shirt all blood-bespattered,
Lying motionless and waiting by the new-
turned heap of clay.
There are records in the office —date of
death and facts pertaining,
Showing name and rank and number and
disposal of the kit—
More or less a business matter, dnd we have
no time for feigning
More than momentary pity for the men
who have been hit.
There's a patient mother gazing on her hopes
so surely shattered
(Hopes and prayers she cherished bravely,
seeking strength to hide her fear),
Boyhood’s dreams and idle memories—
things that never really mattered —-
Lying buried ivhere he’s buried ’heath the
stars all shining clear.
There’s d young wife sorrow-stricken in her
bitter first conception
Of that brief conclusive message, harsh
fulfilment of her dread;
There are tiny lips repeating, with their
childish imperception ,
Simple words that bring her memories
from the boundaries of the dead.
Could the Turk have seen this picture when
his trigger-finger rounded.
Would his sights have blurred a little had
he heard that mother’s prayer?
Could he know some things that she knew,
might his hate have been confounded?
But he only saw his duty, and he did it,
fighting fair.
Just a barren little surface where the grave
mounds rise ungainly,
Monuments and tributes to tlie men who’ve
done their share.
Pain and death, the fruits of battle, and the
crosses tell it plainly,
Short and quick and silent suffering; ivould
to Clod it ended there!

C. J.N., from “The Anzac Book.”
Love Letters of an Anzac, by Oliver
Hogue (“Trooper Bluegmn”)—Melrose, 3s.
6d.—is somewhat interesting, since the
author describes the real thing with con-
siderable journalistic facility, though without
much distinction. His letters have not the
realism, or perhaps one should now call it,
the dinkumism, to be found in the letters of
any non-literary Anzac to his cobber or his
tart or his ma; for “Trooper Bluegum”
seems to think it necessary to inform his
girl of military matters in which no nice
Jean, even though she allowed her boy to
call her “Honeybunch.” would have been the
least interested. Either this Anzac had
an inkling that Jean would ultimately pub-
lish his letters, and therefore he made them
as historically complete as possible, or his
“Honeybunch” was a Sydney newspaper.
The alleged love-interest, consisting chiefly
of endearments and “Light of my Life,” could
so easily have been put in afterwards: at
least, these are so unconvincing that they
have the air of sub-editorial afterthoughts.
Purged of this make-believe sentimentality,
the book would pass as war-correspondence
of about f.a.q.

The War
The Story of a Prisoner of War , by Pri-
vate Arthur Green (Ghatto and Windus;
Is.), is the real thing at last. Green can-
not write : he cannot even spell; but he can
tell the truth, the blankv truth, and nothing
but, the blanky truth. He was wounded and
taken prisoner in the retreat from Mons,
was sent to various Hun prisons, and finally
to the Wittenberg Hell, whence he was. at
last, exchanged as an incapacitated prisoner.
“I got mine in the thigh. I thought I’d
been kicked by an elephant. It hit me
sickey, I can tell. I riggled my straps off,
drank all my water, tried to get up, thinking
I could run ; but I found my leg would not
let me go.” In the first Hun prison the
men soon “got. as lousy as cuckoos.” The
rest of the story is chieflv lice, starvation,
longing for a smoke, and Hun brutality.
Once “they lashed out and gave us a
saveloy, that was the only piece of meat I
had while I was there.”
At Wittenberg, Green notes that one of
the officers was a pig. “He got his cabbage
cooked in the end: but it took nine months
to do it.” “We were not many days there
before we were lousy. I felt ashamed of
myself; but, there! I could not help it.
There was a canteen at this time. The men
had to get in line for this. Then up would
come a German, spot an Englishman, 'out
with his whip, and chase him. Oh! they did
get a time.”
The prisoners had a cheerful Christmas
Day. “Had our ration of bread, 10 to 12
ozs., played a couple of games of crib (cards
made out of backs of cigarett packets),
three-quarters a pint of pea-water, black as
soot, with about 12 peas in it; then off with
our shirts, having a srood hunt for lice. I
was out of the running, only catching about
40. Then a read of the Testament for an
hour, another came of donkey, then a talk
of home and the old times we had had, and
what we should have eaten and drank if we
were there, wishing everyone luck, especially
the boys in the trenches. Then 5 o’clock
1 pt. of flour water. Then we kept up
Christmas by singing a few carols and
songs; but the thing we missed most was a
smoke. We never had a smoke all day.
Then we made our beds down and was in
it, and I suppose most all was asleep by
6.30. And there was no fat heads next day
or bad insides. That was the most terrible
Xmas you could have.”
Contracting “hague,” and with a “temper-
ture,” Green had to go into hospital. “I
was the only Britisher in there. The place
was filthy, the lice were in millions; you
could see them climb up the walls. There
was a Russian carried out, like a bag of
bones. His blanket, what was over him,
looked like frost on it; but I could see it
was lice in millions. I expect he soon died,
or they done him in. That was the first of
the typhus.” Two men died, and “that left
us 18 men. We used to work in their
two bowls for extra dinner, then take it in
turns at having it. We done it for two
months before we were found out.”
P*
The gentle German deserted the camp
when the typhus broke out. There were
15.000 Russians, over 2000 French, 850 Eng-
lish, and about 40 Belgium “civies”; and
the Huns would stand about nine feet from
the wires and speak to the prisoners. The
food was sent down a shoot. There were
about a score of doctors prisoners in the
camp: but they had no means to fight the
fever, And the lice were so bad that at
night Green could not sleep. Ultimately six
English doctors came to the camp, having
volunteered to fight the disease. At this time
the prisoners were dying at an average of
30 a day. “They were burying them 2 in
one box —take them straight down and lay
them along side one another.” The losses,
according to Green were 1500 Russians,
over 300 French, and 87 English, all from
typhus.
“It was during the month of March and
April that we felt the starvation most.
Every one was like wolves. We were also
all affected with itch, which made us nearly
crazy. Then a smoke use to worry us. We
could not get a fag nohow, so we use to cut
up straw out of our beds, coffee grouts,
cut up cigarett holders, and scrape the oil
out of the wood.” And in March they got
their first bath. “Well, it seemed a treat to
miss the lice, for a few hours; but we were
just as bad in a few days.” Green, dying
for a smoke, but having nothing to sell,
took off his under flannel, which he had
been wearing for four months, and gave it
to his chum. It took him two hours to get
some of the grease off; then he dried it and
tramped all over the camp to sell it; but all
he could get for it was a penny. Two hours
later he managed to acquire another half-
penny ; and at 9 o’clock he brought back “a
fag and a bit.” “Then we had a good smoke,
putting a bit away for the morning, and we
thought we were going to enjoy it ourselves.
But first one popped his head out, then
another; so I gave them the hit to go on
with. It was at them times just like giving
them | sovereign each.”
At last permission was given to the Eng-
lish to write home. And a parcel reached
Green’s mate. The good food made him
bad for three or four days; but that night
“we had the pleasure of smoking ourselves
dry. Darkey [his mate] is a great fag-
smoker. lie was out of his mattrass evgry
half-hour lighting up. I shall never forget
the 18th of May, 1915, when we had the
Duff.”
Conditions gradually improved, not because
the Hun repented, but because he was forced
to pretend to a little decency by the insist-
ence of the United States Ambassador. Of
course, the Huns knew the time of that per-
son’s visit, and readied things nicely for his
inspection. But the English gave the game
away to him, and. a surprise visit subse-
quently put the Iluns on their best behavior,
though, as Green indicates, they did not
become angels. And when, finally, Green
was exchanged and reached Holland, he
says, “It seemed, so nice to have kind people
to talk to you.” It must have !
This book would make pleasant reading
for our own interned Huns. It should be
distributed in every camp by our military
authorities.
Drama
Paul Claudel, one of France’s new writers,
had worked for 20 years in an obscurity com-
plete except for the personal talk of
him by certain discerning critics. Claudel
is a Catholic, and a public official, Consul
in various towns in Asia ; so, afraid of dam-
aging his career, he published anonymously.
Suddenly the war allowed him to break his
silence, and now the young critics rank him
as a dramatist with yEschylus and Shalc-
speare. Claudel is primarily a poet, though
his speech is neither prose nor poetry, but a
curious, though dramatically effective, form
of vers libre. He has brought the whole of
his dramatic work together under the general
title of L’Arbre. A French critic claims
that Claudel, is a great religious poet. “His
work, it has been said, is a long pilgrimage
toward God.... The present fashion for
Roman Catholicism (in France) counts for
something in Claudel’s sudden vogue, just as
Claudel has done something to bring about
the fashiop.”
The Tidings Brought to Mary (Chatto
and Windus, 65.) is described by Claudel as
“a mystery” : “the scenes of the drama take
place at the close of the Middle Ages, seen
conventionally, as medieval poets might have
imagined classic antiquity.” It is an inter-
esting drama, but one that bears translation
badly. The form and the content and the
view-point are strange to the Australian
reader. The story starts with a kiss that
a young girl had, in all innocence, given to
a man who loved her. That man, Pierre de
Craon, a master-builder of churches, was a
leper. Volaine’s innocent kiss was seen by
her sister, Mara, who desired to marry
Jacques, to whom Volaine is betrothed. But
Volaine contracts the disease, and discloses
the fact to Jacques. “She cuts the linen of
her gown, upon the side upon the heart,
under the left breast, and leaning towards
him she opens the slit with her hands and
shows him the flesh where the first spot of
leprosy has appeared.” And Mara, who has
already poisoned Jacques’ mind with her
story of Volaine’s kiss, marries Jacques,
while Volaine goes away to the leper’s cave:
In a grim and remarkable scene years later
Mara brings her newly-dead baby to
Volaine’s cave. There the leper-woman tells
Mara that her kiss was innocent, and that
she let Jacques believe her guilty, so that
he would not regret leaving her. The grief-
distraught Mara places the corpse of her
baby in Volaine’s arms, and tensely asks
Volaine to bring the child to life. For the
leper-woman lias assumed in the eyes ot her
sister the character of a saint. The time,
with an obvious symbolism, is that of
Christmas Eve. Wolaine hears the
Christmas Bells, the bells announcing the
midnight Mass. “O Mara,” she cries, “a
little child is born to us!” And Mara re-
plies, “Then give me back mine.” Then in
a mystical scene, in which Mara reads “the
Christmas Service, the First Lesson of each
of the three Nocturnes,” and the voices of
angels are heard chanting in Latin, the
miracle occurs. All the while Yolaine has
held the dead baby beneath her cloak, and
no\v her cloak moves. “The little bare foot
of a baby, moving lazily, appears in the
opening of the cloak.” The child lives!
But the mother looks at it closely as she
takes it.
Volaine!
What does this mean? Its eyes icere
black.
And now they are blue like yours.
Ah!
And what is this drop of milk I see on its
lips?
The mystery ends with the recovery from
leprosy of Pierre de Craon, the cathedral-
builder, and Volaine’s reconciliation with
Jacques, and her death. The final scene is
suffused with the spirit of renunciation and
peace, with the Angelus sounding from
churches far and near —from the churches
that Pierre de Craon has built to the glory
of God.
Paul Claudel has marvellously reproduced
the strange blending of realism with the
poetry of the Middle Ages. His characters
are real people; but they move in an atmo-
sphere of poetry. And the language has the
same vague, medieval beauty, especially in
the speeches of Pierre de Craon, builder of
churches. He speaks of churches “so deli-
cately put together, adjusted with such art.
that they seem as if they would ring like a
bell under a finger-tap.” He defines a
■ cathedral as “Darkness, with God.” And
his apprentice dilates upon his master’s
methods, lie sent an apprentice who stayed
all big time in his corner, drawing, up on
the scaffolding to serve the masons all day.
Saying that by the end of the day he would
know two things better than- he could
learn them by rule and design: the
weight a man can carry, and the height
of Ins body....
Do you think Father Noah was indifferent to
the body when he built the ark? And
are these things of no account? —
The number of paces from the door to the
altar, and the height the eye may be
lifted to, and the number of souls the
two sides of the church may hold all at
the same time?
For the heathen artist made everything from
the outside, but toe make all from within
like the bees,
And as the soul does for the body: nothing is
lifeless, everything lives,
Everything gives thanks in action.
d*
In 1913 Winthrop Ames offered a prize of
lO.OOOdols. for the best play submitted
anonymously by a TJ.S. author. Nearly 1700
MSS. were received, and Alice Brown re-
ceived the cash with Children of Earth, Sub-
sequently produced by Mr. Ames in /New
York, without, apparently, making any per-
manent success, though the critics praised it
highly. It is now published in book form/by
Macmillan, N.Y. (7s. fid. out here). T*ihe
action takes place in a village in New Eng-
land ; and there is much rustic humor and]
joviality, and dancing round the apple-tree,\
and baiting of the love-crazed village idiot by ’ *
the children, and generally a flavor of old
clothes, blossoming orchards, old pewter,
meanness, avarice, suppressed love affairs,
shiftlessness, and middle-aged romance. The
plot hardly matters: it is the subtle charac-
terisation that carries the reader’s interest.
The types are evidently true to life; but the
amount of life that survives in rustic New
England is almost negligible. It is a quiet
little play, lifted into action only once, when
the married middle-aged Peter Hale and a
sexually starved middle-aged spinster decide
to elope. It is the accidental sight of Peter.
Hale’s wife—most awkwardly contrived by
the playwright—about to commit suicide, and
then recalled to her duty of “gifting the
breakfast,” that upsets the romantic plans of
these middle-aged lovers. They decide that
since even the wronged wife can bustle about
and get the breakfast, it is up to them to
stay and face the inevitable scandal. In
the final act the wife makes another and
more difficult sacrifice to shield Aunt Mary
Ellen, by falsely accusing herself of drunken-
ness, her old failing. There is scarcely a
character in the play that does not sacrifice
him or herself. And the play closes with
the two women, Mrs. Peter Hale and Aunt
Mary Ellen deciding to live in the old house
with Peter Hale—a happy family of three.
As Mary Ellen says: “She [Mrs. Hale]
wants to go right on, same’s we’ve been
goin’. An’ she seems to know we can go on.
You an’ I know it—but she knows it, too.”
For all Mrs. Hale wants is .“to have you two
back ag’in. You stay right here in this
house, an’ let me stay with you. And we’ll
work. An’ you’ll keep the devil out o’ me.
An’ Peter Hale’ll come her an’ eat. An’ I’ll
see to the house down there. An’ that’s all.”
If Children of Earth is the best that the
U.S. can do for 10,000d015., here we have the
explanation of the sort of plays that are
imported to Australia. They are the best
available.

The Gem Junior
Safety Razor.
THE GEM JUNIOR solves the Shaving
Problem for the man with a tender skin or
strong beard. It is unequalled for easy and
luxurious shaving.
There is no risk if you buy a GEM JUNIOR
Safety Razor; it makes every man an expert
barber, and is the apex of Razor perfection.
Easy, velvet-like strokes — never a pull, never
a scratch, are features of the GEM JUNIOR,
which assures a clean, safe shave.
THE GEM JUNIOR is always ready for
use, with a fresil blade for every day of the week.
It is so simple that a novice can use it.
GEM JUNIOR BLADES are as thin as
an edge-holding piece of steel can possibly be rolled.
They can be sharpened time and time again, be-
cause they’re tempered to receive an edge and
to hold it when they get it.
THE GEM JUNIOR FRAME has a new
bar feature, which carefully spreads the skin, so
that the stubble is forced out far enough to give
as close a shave as can be secured by going- over
the face twice with any other razor.
THE GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR
is made and finished in the best style, of the
finest materials, and the Highest Skilled labor.
It comprises Nickel Plated f rame, Extra Handle for
Stropping Blades, and SEVEN Keen-edged Blades.
Complete in neat Leatherette Case.

No matter how accurate a rifle or pistol may be, if
the cartridges used in it are variable, the results ob-
tained will be disappointing. Winchester cart-

uniform. They are made by experts in a plant
having every facility for turning out perfect
work. A trial will prove their high quality.

“I certainly believe it was
Clements Tonic cheated death
from claiming me as a victim.”
“ I was pronounced incurable, and sent
home by those best able to judge.”
The following letter is remarkable for its earnestness in praise of this
wonderful Medicine, which does so much good to those who are run down
with debility of the system, and whose health appears seriously impaired.
Mrs. Craft’s case is well known in the Parramatta district (N.S.W.),
where she has lived for years, and the story of her long suffering is well
known and can easily be verified. How she suffered year after year, and
how she recovered through the use of Clements Tonic, is the talk of
Granville. Read the letter that follows, and if you are ill with debility, or
suffering with weak nerves and general weakness, try the magic of this
medicine, and give yourself a chance to recover good health. As it benefited
others, so it may benefit you.
Palmer House, Cooper Street,
Granville, N.S.W.,
CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD. 15/4/’l6.
“I would be lacking in generosity to you and the afflicted if I
did not ask you to make known what Clements Tonic has done for
me. It may be the means of directing others to health.
“It is ten years since I first got ill, and I had a five years’ illness,
the greater part of which time I was not even able to walk about.
I was in four different hospitals, and was operated upon in one. I
know the dread of the knife played havoc on my nervous constitution,
so that I was not only weak in body but weak in nerves.
“I was pronounced an incurable, and sent home by those who
were best able to judge. Friends sat by my bedside at night-time
expecting to see the last of me, hut I certainly believe that it was
Clements Tonic cheated death from claiming me as its victim. I
have lived in the Parramatta district all my hie, and it would be
very easy to verify my statement. You may use this as you think fit.

RHEUMATISM
Its Cause—and Cure.
Rheumatism is caused by a curious,
poisonous acid in the blood. This acid, just
like tiny pieces of broken glass with rough
edges, settles in the joints and muscles and
causes that awful agonising pain of back-
ache, rheumatism and gout, gravel, and the
burning sensation of inflammation of the
bladder, etc.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills
strengthen the kidneys and drive the
poisonous pain-causing acid right out of the
system.
w
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid
of the cause —the poisonous uric acid.
Remember to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you see the urine change to
a muddy bluish color—a feature which dis-
tinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills from all others—you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing
touch on the right spot—the kidneys and
the bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to
the kidneys—that is why De Witt’s pills
give such amazingly quick relief —every
time. A permanent cure follows in almost
every case. Look for that blue-colored urine.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
They will cure every one of the above
symptoms no matter how long or how badly
you have suffered.

“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by
your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in
the week. It is now 12 months since I last used
tobacco, .and, although I am continually in the com-
pany of smokers, I do not have the least desire to
smoke; therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizziness,
Nervousness and Stomach Trouble, which I have every
reason to believe were caused through the use of
tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are only re-
membered as a hideous nightmare. I eat and sleep
well, and feel fit to face the world again. It will give
me great pleasure to recommend your remedy to
others.”

Constipation
The case of Rheumatism or Gout
which Kruschen Salts cannot benef it
has yet to be discovered. This
famous British remedy is also
recommended by Medical Men in
cases of Lumbago, Sciatica, Eczema,
Constipation, and Liver and Kidney
Disorders.
KRUSCHEN AT THE FRONT
Since the outbreak of the War, enormous
quantities of Kruschen Salts have been ordered
by, and delivered to the British Authorities, for
the use of the British Forces overseas and in
the Base Hospitals at Home. Kruschen Salts
are prescribed by Medical Men the world over.
THE WORD KRUSCHEN
The trade mark “ Kruschen ” is a legacy-
handed down from generation to generation of
the family of Evan Griffiths Hughes, the sole
Manufacturers of Kruschen Salts, and one of
the oldest firms of Manufacturing Chemists in
the County of Lancashire. Established 1754 —
160 years ago.

Moonsong.
The stars are winking overhead
Demurely in their impish glee;
They wink because the lazy, red,
Bold moon leaps up to kiss the sea.
The naughty moon has kissed the sea
Nightly for all a million years;
The talk of her inconstancy
Is wicked slander, it appears.
The meteors fall like golden tears,
And in the depths of ocean glow
As cold, soft pearls for Mabel’s m rs,
Or, strung, upon her breasts or snow
Coo into ecstasies. I know
How very happy they must be—
Pearls war* against her heart, although
Her heart is ice to Love and me.
The moon leaps up to kiss the sea,
A moon impatient, flushing red;
And at the sight with impish glee
The stars are winking overhead.

Friendship.
There are no arts (nor all the books that
tell of them
Tell of no artifices that replace them)
To guide frail men concerning who speaks
well of them,
Nor who would honor them, nor who
debase them.
I want to know for sure who is a friend of
mine,
And who would stand by me, and who
would scout me;
What and to whom I ought to give or lend
of mine,
And, in the outcome, who would pay, who
flout me.
I seek a friend that I may freely give to
him
Aught that I value much, as friendship’s
token ;
My life were little, but as I may live to
him
Like to a link, save which fife’s chain
were broken.
I seek in vain among all modern sciences,
For standards, measures, touchstones that
may tell me
Where I may make reliable alliances
With such as, on occasion, will not sell
me.
This may appear a trifle misanthropical—
It is not really, for I am not made so.
I look, benevolently microscopical,
For what is not —at least, I am afraid so.
I hope—no mortal ever hoped more fer-
vently—
To find the things I search for so in-
tently,
Patiently watching, and, not unobservantly,
Seeing who passes, closely, not ungently.
Something too much of this, 'I miss the
touch of it—
Asking the world for something that’s
beside it.
It is but idleness to ask so much of it,
And it is churlish, when it fails, to chide
it.
If social science, like specific gravity,
Could be reduced to a defined equation ;
If we could weigh out virtue and depravity
In grocers’ scales', what need of. this
oration ?
I find I have been making, most informally,
In my mixed manner of oblique allusion,
Two statements, not antagonistic normally,
Yet apt to lead us on to some confusion.
First, that the art is more than hypotheti-
cal
That can distinguish flatterer from lover;
Next, that I languish, in the mode poetical,
For what I fear I never shall discover.
Neither or both be true—but, incidentally,
I’ve hinted that the thing has no exist-
ence,
And all the while declared that, senti-
mentally,
I seek it with illogical persistence. 4
Come to the old trite tag: what’s in the
heart of us
Is all our world, the warrant of our
being;
Friendship and friend are equally a part of
us,
Only the spirit needs the art of seeing.
SPAIN.
WAIF.
Heaven anti Hell.
I seek no vague bliss in a dim hereafter
By walking gloomy paths in pain and tears;
Right well I know that Heav’n is made of
laughter,
And Hell of morbid thoughts and gloom and
tears.
The earth itself builds not its joys in matter,
But by our pleasure everything is fair;
We reap the fruitage of the joy we scatter.
So, if there’s Heaven, we shall harvest there.
Here we already walk in Hell or Heaven
Assailed, it may be, by some earthly pains;
The happy heart supplies the priceless leaven
By which the bread of life its worth attains.
We train our souls to give and garner
laughter,
To think the best, to dream the noblest
dreams,
And Heaven waits not for a vague hereafter,
But through earth’s clouds in present com-
fort gleams.

INDUSTRIAL UNTIDINESS AND
COAL DUST.
When it was announced the other day that
the Commonwealth Ministry and the Sydney
Coal-lumpers’ Union had arranged for the
formation of a naval transport coal-
ing battalion, it appeared appropriate to
various newspapers that they should offer
some more or less profound remarks about
“regimentation” and its dangers; also about
strikes and patriotism and the propriety of
adjourning industrial squabbles until the war
peters out. The point of most of the solemn
observations was that to hold up a transport
by a strike is an act of disloyalty, and that
the first consideration of every citizen should
be to keep the preparations for war going
without interruption. If this represented all
there was to say about the battalion of
coalies, the mobilisation of these toilers
would be merely an incident of temporary
significance. But the battalion is some-
thing more than that, and its formation sug-
gests ideas extending a long way beyond the
mere hurried flinging of coal into a steamer’s
bunkers. Under the agreement entered into,
the Lumpers’ Union binds itself that there
shall be no interruption of the work of get-
ting the transports away. Now that repre-
sents a step forward in organisation, the
introduction of reason into an atmosphere of
chaos; a recognition under the stress of war
that there is something more for men to toil
for than the day’s pay. So long as men
imagine there is not they are little better off
than bullocks beneath the yoke. When
society can' see the truth lurking behind
Arbitration Acts and coal lumpers’ battalions
■ —behind even the frantic howls we hear
regarding “class warfare” —then it will begin
to get a reasonable hang of the Capital and
Labor problem. Incidentally, it will then
commence to understand what citizenship
implies. It will acquire, too, a grasp of what
loyalty means —instead of imagining it to be
indissolubly mixed up with Gor’save and
a Cocked Hat. The great truth struggling
to be seen and heard is that work is social
service; that the primary duty of men and
women is to labor for the common good. Of
course it is a fine, large, plastic truth capable
of infinite . distortion. The form in which
it has received acceptance so far from society
makes the world look like a pack of dingoes
at work among a mob of sheep. And it is
often mighty hard to tell which is which.
* * * *
When coal-lumpers go on strike and stick
up a transport, while agitated officials rush
round struggling to tidy up the mess, what
they mainly succeed in doing is to illustrate
the muddled condition of society. When
they agree not to strike when loading trans-
ports, they concede the existence of a social
claim upon the individual; further, they make
it plain enough that social and industrial
muddle mostly exists elsewhere because there
is very little genuine attempt to remove it. It
also exists because there are very powerful
vested interests in the perpetuation of muddle.
If the same weight was given to social con-
siderations when dealing with industrial and
economic questions in time of peace as is
given to at least some matters of public con-
cern in time of war, there would be a fairly
decent chance for society to get its head up.
Every sane citizen sees a social disgrace in
allowing these vessels to be the sport
of warring individual interests. Why?
Because war has touched the civic spirit.
Because, in the face of war, considerations
that had been submerged in the greedy
struggles of peace have forced their way to
the top. And because in time of war men’s
minds are purged, in part at least, of the
baser anti-social impulses, and notions of
communistic obligations find expression. But
the ethics of these are, not limited to moments
of what are called national crises, nor to
men who perform humble tasks with dirty,
sweating bodies and heavy shovels. Every
hour in the life of a nation is a critical hour.
Every citizen is part" of a whole, with his
rights and privileges as a citizen, but with
no rights or privileges that are inconsistent
with the public welfare. There is no essen-
tial difference between a strike of profes-
sional coal-shifters alongside an Australian
transport and a strike of Melbourne bakers
and mill-hands. Botli are socially disgrace-
ful. The existence of the causes which lead
to these disturbances is more scandalous. If
the lumper and baker be blafnable, as they
surely are, the greater blame rests on. society,
and it is society which pays the price.
* * * *
Heaven alone knows what the human
family is blundering along to, but it is cer-
tain that the work of the world cannot
best be done if left to haphazard perform-
ance. There were some glimmerings of this
in Australia in the long ago when the idea
of industrial arbitration took root. The
history of that experiment has to some
extent been a disappointment. But it is
not the idea that is wrong. That still
stands as the foundation on which a better
State will be built. If it did not thus stand
the outlook for society would be towards
anarchy; for unless there be social respon-
sibilities, civilisation is merely a jocular
interlude between our descent from the trees
and our retirement into the jungle. But
even though the arbitration system has
failed to yield anything like perfection it
has still carried Australia nearer to a reali-
sation of the truths of citizenship than is
implied by the frequent recurrence of strikes.
So far from strikes proving or even suggest-
ing the hopelessness of social organisation
they do exactly the reverse. They flourish
because there is no organisation, and taken
in the main can only be regarded as vague,
clamorous protests against a social order in
which evasion of duty is rampant —in which
existence is to the mass of men and women
merely a disordered scramble after a share in
the national earnings, with society busy loot-
ing itself, and in which civic ideals ordinarily
carry less weight than do speculations on the
price of a leg of mutton. Arbitration has
sagged for a variety of reasons, mainly be-
cause it was asked to carry too big a weight,
and because of a delusion that it represented
the top of the ladder instead of a far-down
rung. There are cocksure individuals with
their mouths full of copious explanations
about how to correct these mistakes and
ready to fix society up in a new suit and get
it shaved and shampooed and equipped with
gold-filled teeth all in five minutes. There
are any number of other persons waving leg-
irons in the breeze and explaining that these
would put things right in five minutes. Such
quacks are no use. The road ahead has not been
paved and swept and dusted in advance. It
is full of holes and unexpected ditches and
strewn with sharp stones and spiky vege-
tables. Nevertheless, The Bulletin has an
unbreakable faith that the track ahead is
neither so rough nor so long as the one be-
hind. It was a queer-looking rabble that
started out on the path of progress away
back at the beginning of things, and even
if it still be unkempt and shabby, it has a
bath occasionally and there are enough boots
to go round, and it sees the stars. And
every sign there is that the civic ideal is
ripening, that the organisation of society for
the good of society is going forward, is -an
indication that we- are nearer a plane on
which men will use their brains and hands for
something better than the enrichment of
their own plutocracy. There are many such
signs, and this coal-shifters’ battalion, with
its black face and its toil-worn hands and
its dinner in its pocket, is one of them. So
this paper, in the midst of a great untidi-
ness, with much more to arrive later on,
gives these coalies three cheers, and, if an
intelligent Censorship will let it, inquires
whether the shipowners have been doing any-
thing which looks quite like the same thing.
THE SERF WITH THE HOE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Someone remarks that the Clerks’ Union
can’t get its alleged grievances redressed
because its members are too poor in spirit
to down tools and go out on strike. The
same, and a lot more, may be said of the
small farmers, those joyless toilers who mix
it with dairying, vegetable growing and
other small industries that keep their backs
bent for 14 hours 'a day.
One never hears the old gag of the “in-
creased cost of living owing to the war”
raised on the farmer’s behalf: yet everything
he uses in his business —agricultural imple-
merits, seeds, manure, spraying material, gal-
vanised iron, bags, sewing twine, rabbit-
proof netting, fencing wire, harness, horse-
shoes, etc. —has been bumped from 50
to 300 per cent, higher than the
prices ruling before Bill of Berlin went
fanti. In addition to that disaster, the
prices of the stuff he produces have fallen
so low that he can’t earn a living
wage, let alone interest on the capital in-
vested in land and stock. Even a farmer
has to exist somehow. True, in N. S. Wales
the Holman crowd doesn't admit the neces-
sity-. Hence whenever anything the farmer
produces appears in danger of returning him
a small profit for his labor, it is promptly sat
upon by some fool commission, in the inter-
ests of well-paid city workers, who in the
intervals between strikes growl at having to
work eight hours a day. At the same time,
they want the farmer to supply them with
cheap food by toiling 14 hours a day.
The alleged aim of the Trades Hall-ridden
Government is to prevent the producers tak-
ing advantage of war conditions to raise
the price of their products. Yet the city
wage earner, by combining to strike for
higher pay, can just as truly be accused of
extorting “war profits” from his country’s
misfortune as any highwayman in York-
street. And note how his friends in power
assist him to do it. He is given the biggest
say in fixing the price of the labor he has to
sell; but the cocky farmer has no say at all
in fixing the price of his produce. And
while the arrogant wharf-laborer sees
to it that his minimum salary is fixed,
the serf on the land has to suffer the rank
injustice of having a maximum price fixed
upon the products of his labor by a Commis-
sion upon which he is not represented. When
chaff -took a rise last year, owing to the dry
seasons, Holman accused the cockies of
being rapacious sharks who were holding
their stacks back for still higher prices. As
a matter of fact, most of the poor devils had
such miserable crops that the little they had
•to sell wouldn’t have paid them at £2O per
ton. The State then jumped into the busi-
ness—having nothing of its own invested —
and imported shiploads of rubbish that cost
nearly twice as much as our own growers
were compelled by law to accept, being thus
robbed to enrich a few Yankees. Now, if
it was true last year that the cockies could
and would have combined to force up the
price of chaff if the Government hadn’t
imported alleged chaff and sold it at a ruin-
ous loss, why is .chaff now being sold in the
Sydney market at £4, when the price still
fixed by law is £7 10s.? Why isn’t tlie
rapacious cocky combining to get the price
the ass-made law allows him to get—lf he
can? One reason is that he has no friends
who will fix a minimum wage for his labor,
in return for giving them his political sup-
port.
Turn now to another affluent monopo-
list—the cocky who supplies the suffer-
ing city of Sydney with vegetables.
The growing of cabbages is always
mentioned as a gilt-edged industry by
the experts who cultivate them in the daily
newspaper offices; but I, who live among
them, haven’t so far met a grower who is
getting fat on “war profits”—-or any
other profit. Cabbages are almost as ex-
pensive to raise as mortgages —a sister in-
dustry. Costly manure is required (many
growers use as much as a ton to the acre),
and seed costs 225. Gd. per lb. The labor of
planting, watering and hoeing between the
rows is a back-breaking and (this season) a
heart-breaking job. After months of tedious
toil the grower starts to market his goods.
Watch him cutting them by the light of a
lantern in the drizzling rain, then humping
them to the waggon waiting on the road.
There he counts them and stacks them, and
while the city toil-dodger is still aDed dream-
ing of less work with more pay, he is trudg-
ing the weary miles to the station. He
remembers that his grandfather died still
speculating hopefully upon the promised rail-
way. and, as he sploshes through the mud, he
ruminates upon the fact that a Government,
too virtuous to legalise the tote, intends to
spend £ll,OOO upon a hop, step and jump
line to a Northern racecourse, so that its
friend Ikey Noses may open his bag with
more speed and comfort. So much money is
spent upon the luxuries of the consumers, so
little upon the necessities of the producers.
The producer realises this in a dull sort of
way when he receives the account sales of his
load of cabbages, accompanied by a request
from the agent to send along a few shillings
to balance his account for freight and com-
mission. What would a wharf-laborer say
if his employer asked him to part up a few
bob for the privilege of stacking wheat?
It is useless to quote the law of supply
and demand to this farmer. That law, he
has found out, only works when there is a
glut. When there is only half a crop and
the “inexorable law” starts to send prices
up, the wharfies and other city workers com-
mence to cry about the increased cost of liv-
ing. and the Government at once flies to
their rescue. No chance of the cocky mak-
ing up his losses!
Take the much-abused cow-cocky, for
instance. In the winter time he has to hand-
feed his cows—all the time, lately. Butter
is scarce in the winter and, naturally, should
be dearer; but the political servants of the
city laborer very thoughtfully provide against
that by compelling the cow-cockies to lodge
30 per cent, of their butter in cold storage, as
a reserve to be drawn upon in winter. Did
anyone ever hear of importers being com-
pelled to store wheat-bags when they are
cheap, so that they couldn’t squeeze an exor-
bitant price from the wheat cocky at harvest
time? Don’t all speak at once! Here is an
extract from the market report of the Daily
Telegraph (16/6/T6) :—-
Stocks of carbide on spot are now concentrated,
and the market is in the hands of two or three
houses. Some holders asked £4O per ton.
It meant £lOO fine for the cocky to hold back
his chaff last year, and his haystacks, re-
served for a dry time, were liable to be seized
by a Government that is always abusing lnm
for not making any provision against drought.
Why doesn’t the Government inquire into
the prohibitive prices demanded by im-
porters for fencing wire, bags, and a lot or
other things that are at least as necessaij
to farmers as beer and plum puddings an
to the city electors?
If something isn’t done soon to ease the
strain, the man with the hoe may get really
annoyed and follow the advice of that Tam-
worth farmer who publicly advocated that
10 men from every district in the State
should march to Macquarie-street and argue
the point. Perhaps, when a large body of
returned soldiers have settled on the land
and discovered the sort of job they are up
against, the hint of the indigant Tam worth
cocky may be taken seriously.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Hughes’s Shipping Deal.
\V. Hughes has bought 15 steamers and
handed Australia the bill. It is a
horribly big bill —for about two millions.
It represents some of the price Australia has
to pay for war; and so far as the Labor
party is concerned it is the consequence of
leaping out of bed when the house is afire to
attend to something which should have
been done long before. There is an _ old
plank in the Labor platform labelled “Freight
and Passenger Steamers.” This deal is that
plank hurriedly dragged out. The pur-
chase may, nevertheless, prove a good one
for Australia, especially if it means an
increase of tonnage for the transfer of the
nation’s products. The mere purchase of
the steamers is, however, no guarantee
that tonnage now utilised by Australia will
not be diverted to fill the hole made by the
removal of the purchased ships. If the
result of the transaction is not to more
rapidly move the harvest there will be very
little to crow about. Still, in view of the
prevailing confusion and the abnormal de-
mand for shipping and the plentiful stacks
of wheat, what Hughes has done was in all
probability the only alternative to sitting
down and waiting for whatever might hap-
pen next. So far as price is concerned it
is easy criticism to say that we paid too
much. Whether we did or not depends
almost wholly on the probable duration of the
war, and on that point Hughes ought now
to be better informed than any of his critics
in Australia. Obviously if the vessels had
to work on a pre-war rate at least half the
two millions of value would suddenly vanish.
But there has been great destruction of ship-
ping during the war. The war is still on. Its
cessation must, for a time at any rate, lead
to great activity in shipping. And it is fair
to assume that Hughes weighed the risks,
and took advantage of his position to esti-
mate the duration of the war and the move-
ments of shipping and freight charges. On
this assumption, it may be reasonably con-
cluded that in Hughes’s judgment either
the war and a high rate of freight, or both,
will last sufficiently long to clear the
steamers even at the terrific price Australia
must pay for them.

The Foolish Habit of Barking at
Shadows.
The circular issued by Federal Treasurer
Higgs suggesting that wage-earners might
subscribe to the war loan by purchasing
£lO bonds with weekly payments through
their employers has been met by a howl of
protest from the Nepean (N.S.W.) Labor
Council. It seems about the silliest yelp of
the season. The justification for it is stated
to be (1) the grave danger of employers
putting the screw on workers and compel-
ling them to subscribe; (2) the fact that
married men on meagre wages could not
possibly pay ss. weekly to acquire a bond.
The obvious answer is that the likelihood of
there being an Australian employer mad
enough to try to exercise compulsion in this
matter over an Australian workman is as
remote as the Day of Judgment, and that
even if there are some men who cannot save
there are without a doubt many who can
and do. Common knowledge of the relation-
ship of workmen and employers in Aus-
tralia is sufficient to guarantee the first
part of this answer. The figures relating to
Savings Bank transactions prove the second
part. Knibbs estimates that there are
610,558 persons in Australia whose earnings
run from £2 to £4 weekly, and it is a fair
assumption, borne out by the information
relating to the number of married and
unmarried people in the Commonwealth,
that' a very large number of this total are
men and women without any other
“encumbrance” than themselves. These are
the people who in the main are savings-bank
depositors. AVhat is wrong with them lend-
ing money to Australia for war purposes t
In what way is it more “dangerous’ for
them to do tiiis than to lend it, as they do,
to wild-cat State Governments/ The
Nepean Labor Council is looking at things
the wrong end up. Participation in this
war lorn is a patriotic duty, and while it is
a pity that some Australian men and women
will be compelled to say they cannot assist,
it is almost as great a calamity that Miere
should be others who encourage those who
could assist tv say “I will not.” It is ;
Forward!
The Bulletin
We waited long; and hope deferred, like
fear,
Ate at our hearts. But purpose staunch
and keen,
Marking the months that made the second
year,
Cast forth despairs for all that might have
been.
And. grimly holding to the small hope won.
Watched for the man-filled trench and steel-
fed gun.
The word has come. At last the battle
moves!
O’er leagues of trenches torn by shot and
shell
Britain in arms her ancient prowess proves.
Her long-pent valor, with the battle yell
Of eager courage, follows its desire,
And the foe reels amid destroying fire !

small thing that is asked, anyhow. The
poorest French peasant emptied the family
stocking on to the table long ago. It is not
the screw of an employer the Australian
has to fear in this business. The thing to
be fought off is the heel of a Prussian boot.
Making Martyrs by Bad Judgment.
Roger Casement’s trial has not brought out
any facts which make him appear heroic. Even
from the point of view of the most uncom-
promising Irish patriot it was bad business to
seek aid from the German. In the old days
Wolfe Tone could go with perfect dignity
to French republicans and ask them to send
over an army to help in establishing an Irish
republic. It might not have been the wisest
course; but the innate sympathy between
Frenchman and Irishman, which was racial
as well as political, made the proceeding
fitting enough. Caseaient’s mission was of
a different kind. He had spent his life m
the direct service of Britain, and when the
country he had served and which had given
him cash and honor was in the worst straits
he went over to the enemy of all free peoples,
and pleaded for help in such a way as to
bitterly prejudice the best interests of Ire-
land. Neither racially nor politically could
Germany have any sympathy for Casement’s
country, though she might be induced to use
it as a tool. But if Casement did nothing
heroic himself, the Government, by its folly
in taking his trial out of Ireland, gave him
the status which he sought. He was abso-
lutely correct in his claim that he should
have been tried by a jury of his own country-
men ; and the fact that he did not get such
a trial indicates a strange lack of courage
on the part of British Ministers. The whole
trouble with Ireland, as Asquith knows,
has been the unwillingness of Irishmen to
admit the judgment of England on matters
affecting their country; yet in this matter
of a trial for High Treason they, were still
prepared to follow the old irritating course,
and take the big risk of inflaming rebellion,
rather than the minor risk that an Irish jury
might bring in a verdict against the weight of
evidence. Casement, condemned by his own
country, would have been forgotten, in an
hour; Casement, condemned by Englishmen,
at once takes his. place among the notable
sufferers in the national cause.

Waiting for Our Great Offensive.
W. M. Hughes has done some things that
stand quite alone in the record, of Australian
talk in England. Other politicians have
gone forth on special missions, and some of
them have been successful and some have not.
Hughes stands among those who have not.
He failed all along the line in doing those
things which he avowedly set but to do; but
there never was a representative of this
continent who said more about matters on
which he had no instructions to speak at all,
and about which he had no means of know-
ing the will of the people of the country he
serves. And therein lies Hughes’s
magnificence. Others paused, remained
silent, or spoke the simple and easily-
mouthed platitude, because they were
burdened by the sense of responsi-
bility. Not so he. Opportunities to talk
presented themselves; ancient Tory reaction-
aries, with a noisy ha’penny press behind
them, ached to hear their opinions voiced.
The man from Australia stepped in and
obliged. He took England by storm —the
ha’penny press saw to that —and, throwing
all sense of respoilsibility to the winds, he
filled British ears with torrents of brave
Avoids. Now, with his 15 grain ships to cover
the fact that he failed to obtain the freights
he went to seek, his University diplomas to
hide the truth that the other matters in his
charge went wrong, and his freedom of
cities to disguise the British Labor party’s
coldness, he returns to Australia to—do
what? Already anti-conscriptionists are
waitinsr foi him with an axe, and other
weapons are being furbished up by various
sections and parties to greet him at his
landing. Will Hughes yield tamely and
fade away into impotent nothingness in a
maze of explanation? Not if we have the
true measure of the man! He. will gird
himself to this new task, with facile jaw and
untiring throat, until the mere multitude of
his words becomes the pride of an astonished
continent. On a moderate calculation,
Hughes will have to speak 10 times as much
as he did in England to produce the neces-
sary confusion —and that will represent an
offensive of the tongue beside which all pre-
vious Australian effort must sound like the
chirping of young sparrows in a windy tree.
Why Not a Citizen Fleet?
Australia has the beginnings of a citizen
army and there are flickering hopes that the
thing may soon take stronger shape and
form, the ranks being filled with grown men
whose training will be sufficient for some-
thing like adequate defence. Now the pur-
chase of an Australian merchant fleet opens
up the possibility of a citizen navy.
Australia is an island; and the endur-
ing advantage of an island is that,
within certain limits, a fleet can defend
it. Moreover, Australia is a very big
island, with a very long coastline and very
little in the way of railway connection
between point and point, and a fleet is obvi-
ously its surest if not its only protection
against invasion. Why, then, not make the
new mercantile squadron a means of training
for the crews of our future warships? Naval
construction is a pretty slow business at
best, but the training of men to handle war-
ships is still slower. Even the wheat ships
themselves would on the outbreak of any
trouble have some value as auxiliary cruisers.
They certainly couldn’t fight regular craft of
war, but they could be used as eyes and ears,
and" be a menace to transports approaching
our coast. Our citizen army will provide us
with a great fighting force of soldiers who
are earning their living, and incidentally the
living of the country, while still in training
and ready for the field. Our citizen navy of
the reserve might be in exactly the same
position if the notion of blending merchant
service with naval training were taken up
heartily. Incidentally, our merchant sailors
wouldn’t lose anything by the smartening of
naval drill and discipline.
Ten weeks ago the German losses before
Verdun were joyfully estimated (by our
side) at anything between 150,000 and
250,000. Then they mounted by easy stages
to 300, 400, and 500.000. All this while
the vastness of the Crown Prince’s sacri-
fices was instanced as evidence of the
enemy’s desperate plight. Newspaper theories
were built on the comforting assumption
that the Huns were paying for the Verdun
position about 300,000 more casualties than
it could ever be worth. Just a week ago,
however, the cable gravely informed us as
follows
According - to a message from Berne, in Switzerland,
a high German diplomatist is reported to have esti-
mated the German losses at Verdun at 170,000.
Which brings us up against a disturbing
conflict of suppositions. Either the German
losses are merely in keeping with the orig-
inal announcement that the Kaiser was pre-
pared to lose 200,000 troops in capturing
Verdun, or . the “high German diplomatist,”
if he really exists, was telling a wilful
diplomatic lie. We pay our penny and we
take our choice. In any case, we are left
with the unpleasant reflection that we still
tend to magnify our own gains and the
enemy’s losses. Isn’t it time this silly
policy was changed? Every month or two
some responsible Minister comes out with
the announcement that it is imperative
that we make this or the other great effort;
then the newspapers, controlled by a Cen-
sorship which from the outset has been a
good friend to Germany, announce tin
effect: “But why do anything more? We
are winning, anyhow!”
According to Tirpitz, in some remarks
made in 1914, the Kaiser’s navy could afford
to remain inert for two years, by which
time Germany would have won the war on
land and would be able to command peace
with her Dreadnoughts still unscarred. To
those unthinking optimists who regarded tin;
statement as a lying excuse for a fleet of
shirkers, the recent doings in the North Sea
were a warning lesson. What we now know
for certain is that the Kaiser has tried to
do everything but one which he threatened
to accomplish. Thus far he has failed to
capture Paris, Calais, the remaining little
bit of Belgium, or Dvinsk in Russia. But
his obedient minions have not ceased to try
to capture the places he hoped to arrive at.
The one thing that remains an empty Ilun
boast is the invasion of England. Is the
war likely to end ere that one crowning
design of German ambition has been actu-
ally attempted? We have to beware of
possibilities. Our worst friends are the
vainglorious asses who mistake prudence for
pessimism, and dope themselves with
optimism till 'their intelligence is dazed.
Our motto in this vast conflict must be
“Hope for the best and prepare for the
worst.”
Shackleton’s expedition to the South Pole
has been a series of disasters from the first.
One ship, the Aurora, had to be patched up
in Sydney before it went any further. Subse-
quently the old tub blew back without a
rudder or something to Maoriland, after hav-
ing mislaid nine of the crew with a couple of
sandwiches. Now the Aurora is being hur-
riedly mended again (and once more at pub-
lic expense) to go back and see what
happened to the missing men. If they im-
pounded a sufficient number of penguins
before the birds migrated, and if they sur-
vived 745 assorted perils in addition to indi-
gestion, they will be all right. Shackleton’s
other ship, the Endurance, was burst into
fragments in an icefield, and Shackleton
and three or four companions reached a
whaling station after a score of their mates
had taken refuge in an icehole at Elephant
Island with a tin of sardines. The last
heard of this lot is that a relieving vessel
which set out from the Falkland Islands was
the wrong sort of vessel, and was driven
back by ice. What has been transpiring
meanwhile in the icehole is less pleasant to
think about than roast turkey. Even at its
present stage the record is a ghastly re-
minder that somebody’s boot should have
come down on the whole foolish business long
ago. These expeditions are utterly futile —
a waste of time, energy, men and cash. That
they should involve Australia in expendi-
ture is a scandal.

It is no wonder that Auditor-General
Israel groans about the Federal finances.
It took him nine months’ harrying and
worrying to get necessary documents and
vouchers from various offices, especially
from the military section of the Defence
Department; and even then he didn’t get.
and never will get, all the papers he needed.
The irregularities move him to anguish. The
stock sheets of the Small Arms factory are
“utterly unreliable,” and “there appear to be
a very large number of important defici-
encies.” The Sydney ordnance stores stock-
sheets also show very many discrepancies;
and a visit to the Sydney paymaster’s office
gave the A.-G. the jumps, “the accounts
being in an unsatisfactory uosition, the cash
book kept anyhow and not checked, while
£IO,OOO worth of unpaid cheques and cash
due to soldiers were kept in an office safe.”
If they were always kept in the office safe
it wouldn’t be so bad; a worse trouble is
that now and then a chenue has mysteri-
ously disappeared. The whole office is in
an appalling muddle; and Pearce ought to
invite the assistance of a small commission
of business-men to straighten things out.
They could be easilv got—the very best men
in Sydney or Melbourne —and it might stop
the present sheer waste of tens of thousands
of pounds.
It is stated that the N. S. Wales Parlia-
mentary Labor Caucus, when discussing the
question of robbing the nub-closi g poll of
some of its terrors by permitting the sale
of light wines with meals up till S p.m., took
the view that —•
It would be unfair to allow a person rich enough
to patronise fashionable restaurants to have wine
with his dinner, while denying the working- man the
privilege of washing his meal down with a mug of
beer.
All of which makes a handsome bouquet of
thistles. In the first place, it is not the
habit of working men to sluice their food
down with beer; in the second place it is
not suggested that the sale of wine should
be restricted to fashionable restaurants and
expensive pubs. What is suggested is that,
while the doors are slammed against the sale
of the more potent liquors, reasonable oppor-
tunity might be given to the wine-making
industry, under conditions from which the
elements that end in drunkenness would be
removed. The consumption of light Austra-
lian wine by people who want it would
surely inflict no hardship on people who do
not. And wherein lies the Labor objection
to allowing the working man to get aus-
tralian wine if he happens to arrive too late
for the beer? This foolish parade of timidity
is merely another indication of how hope-
lessly antiquated the whole business of
drink-distribution has become.

According to a recent letter, nothing had
been done by the Defence Department to end
that snobbery which in Egypt directs Bill-
jui that he may ride only third-class. Or
if anything had been done it had not been
effective. If it is proposed that. Billjim
shall continue to suffer this indignity, let us
at least make his training complete, and pro-
vide a sufficient number of third-class and
suitably-dirty carriages for his accommoda-
tion at home. If we are not game to do
this at home, then it is grossly unfair that we
should call upon him to submit to it once we
have got him abroad. Ours is a citizen army,
the military chiefs might remember —not an
army of derelicts who have taken to the
colors as a last desperate resort to raise a
bob.

A crowd of jewellers went to Tudor, Min-
ister for Customs, the other day and asked
him to lift the war order prohibiting the
importation of gold ornaments. It told
about the poorest sort of yarn, though the
Chamber of Commerce backed it, and
Tudor went away to consult with the
Treasurer. That consultation ought to be
brief and to the point. Gold jewellery is
no sort of necessity; and the only excuse
the barbaric business can give for its exist-
ence in a country like this is that it pro-
vides 1600 people with a job.. The deputa-
tion to Tudor asks for a juicier job for the
middleman dealer in the stuff by turning
him into an importer; but as all evidence
shows that the juicier jobs of this sort pro-
vided from time to time have been a bitter
loss to the country, Tudor ought to come
back from his talk with the Treasurer with
derision on his lips and tell those jewellers
plainly to get work.
The Argus is torn by a conflict in her ample
bosom. She runs a “rural interests” depart-
ment which for some time has strongly- sup-
ported the Victorian Farmers’ Union, while
cheery reports on the formation of additional
branches have been given prominence in
other parts of the paper. But when secre-
tary Isaac Hart declared the other day that
the policy of the Y.F.U. is “to run its own
Parliamentary candidates,” the old lady
plunged her pen into her tear-pot and sobbed
thus: “It would greatly imperil the cause of
good government to have a third political
party spring out of the Victorian Farmers’
Union.” “Good government,” you see,
consists of supporting one of two
parties, whether . you . believe in what
either of them is doing or not. The
Argus is horrified when the Labor
Caucus cracks the whip and brings recalci-
trants to heel. That is tyranny. But it is
“good government” when two parties crack
two whips and bring everybody in the State
to heel.
As far as they go, the Eveleigli (N.S.W.)
workshops are still hammering the importers’
joss. Engines built there hold the world’s
record for mileage done without cleaning;
and the new locomotives for the express , to
the Queensland border —a long trip with
much hill-climbing—are admitted cham-
pions. Yet only a decade or so back it was
thought necessary to send orders to the
U.S. for engines of any old sort. Now 28
of the imported coal-eaters are being re-
formed by Australian workmen, who promise
to. make a saving of between 25 and 35 per
cent, on the consumption of coal and water.
The unsatisfactory part of the business is
that more than half of the material used in
these performances is still imported, and
appalling delays are suffered in consequence.

“Quidam” : One of the most aggravating
features of the Slaughter in Europe is the
impossibility of sizing up any of the great
men concerned and deciding whether they
really are great men or not. Owing to offi-
cial lies and suppressions, absence of un-
fettered critics and various other factors,
the atmosphere of the battlefields has been
reduced to one of heavy fog in which occa-
sional rifts allow of such glimpses that only
misleading inferences are to be drawn.
Even the Kaiser, principal hero or direst
villain, is obscured, and opinions as to his
greatness or otherwise are as divided as
before the disturbance began. Is he a very
great man. the motive power and main-
spring, or only an energetic mediocrity, the
polished brass nut on the spindle? It is
not really necessary to know, but mankind
has got "into the habit of wanting to be
informed of many unnecessary things, such
as the distance of the furthest star and
the temperature of the South Pole. It is
the same with most of the other actors in
the drama —everybody who is doing any-
thing. The spruikers have the best of it.
Asquith and Lloyd George, Billy
Hughes also, have been able to convey
pretty definite impressions of themselves to
the public. But as for the real toilers, no
one knows whether the world will ever be
able to size them up correctly. The chances.
are that they will be simply overwhelmed
by the champion fluters. It seems part of
the price we have to pay for the system
under which the men who talk have to
pretend that they govern even if they don’t,
while those who listen have to pretend to be
their bosses, even though they are not.
“Spiro” : As an instance of the devitalising
influence of syphilis, Dr. Gamble, of the
Kew (Vic.) Asylum, has stated that two-
thirds of the idiot and imbecile children ex-
amined at that institution a few years ago
were the offspring of syphilitic parents, as
shown by the Wasserman blood test. Illus-
trating inherited syphilis as the cause of pri-
mary dementia, he cited the case of a
syphilitic man married to an apparently
healthy woman. They had nine children.
The five eldest were more or less insane. A
sister and a brother are inmates of the Kew
Asvlum; another sister is in Yarra Bend,
whilst, at home, the parents are managing
as best they can a son and a daughter, both
distinctly mental deficients. Gonorrhoea, so
lightly and jauntily regarded by some fools,
is, as regards women, as serious as, if not
Lip Service.
Randolph Bedford discusses a Censor and
Gomorrah :■ —-
Tom Buchanan, of Coalinga (Gal.), leaves Aus-
tralia for home very soon. Tom was for a long
time in Columbus, Ohio, and when I told him that
the State of Ohio has elaborated its censorship of
films to the criminal extent of limiting the kiss
of the movie hero and heroine to 10 feet of film, ’he
became deeply emotional, and said that he would
avoid the State of Ohio as a pestilence. For it is
certain that the righteous men of Ohio or Gomorrah,
who thus put a throttle-valve on photographic
passion, will lose little time in limiting" the dura-
tion of kisses of real men and women who kiss not
for money but for fun or keeps.
The war, by giving woman the man’s job, which
her own vanity will refuse to relinquish after the
war, is certain to intensify the real war that has
always been and never knows peace—the war of
sex. Its nearest approach to peace is but an
armistice so that a new child may be begotten.
And then there come these scurvy knaves, the cen-
sors, further depreciating the chances of population
by making laws to govern equally Brother Anjemia
and Hercules— to apply equally to Mrs. Skin-&-
Grief (poor soul, it is not her fault!) and Venus
of the maturescent breast; to Master Thxnbeard
and Colossus who measures 48 inches around the
chest. Then will they carry their madness further,
these haters of life and sunlight. Censorship of
the film-kiss will pall; therefore will they with
mouths leaking pleasantly follow maid and man to
Lovers’ Lane, spying upon the kiss of bride and
groom, stop-watch in hand, counting the legal
number of seconds, and then crying, “Break, or I
bring the police!”
These considerations, emphasised by me with
cruel gladness to the man who lived in Ohio, have
made Tom Buchanan decide that he will fly across
the dreadful State, if needs be he must go near it at
all; and, further, that if the Fates permit, he will
stay in California —warm, fecund California with
the old brown Missions and the old Spanish love of
living; California and its serried rows of the wine
grape; with the pleasant city where the 1200 saloons
threw away their bar-door keys the day they got
their licenses by San Francisco Bay.
To kiss is so natural that, when a man is asked
for a definition of the act, he stammers and balks
his words, and at last goes hotfoot to the “Encyclo-
pedia Britannica.” And this is all that portentous
and in many ways foolish oracle has to say on the
King of indoor games and the chiefest pleasure of
the world. Find it on page 837, Yol. 15, “Ita to
Kys”:—
“KISS: The act of pressing or touching with the
lips, cheek, hands or lips of another as a sign or
expression of love, affection, reverence or greeting.
Skeat (Etym. Diet. 1898) connects the Teutonic
base Kussa with the Latin Gustos, taste, and with
the Gothic, liustus, test, from Kinsan, to choose;
and takes ‘kiss’ as ultimately a doublet of choice.”
The kiss of peace doesn’t count, humanly speak-
ing, because it is now down to the mere kissing of
stoles and oblations and Eucharistic services; but
all the rest of life is based and crowned by the
half-dozen lines of the inhuman “Encyclopaedia
Britannica,” which is more interested in the deriva-
tion of the word than in the tremendous meaning
and consequence of the act. I do not know what
the kiss of reverence may be, except it be the
kissing of the dead; and herein there is less of
reverence than of love or heartbreak. The kiss of
greeting is probably that frosty peck that women
give each other, without affection or emotion; and
the foolish old Encyclopaedia mentions never the kiss
of duty, which is the kiss of habit of the man or
of the woman who wishes to feel martyrised and
misunderstood. Nor does it speak of the kiss of
Judas —a very much and unjustly maligned man,
bv the way; for he repented, and where there is
shame there is virtue. It fails to tell of the kiss
of the sister of Judas, which is the kiss of the
interested courtesan, of the woman who married for
money, and of the adultery that wipeth its mouth
and sayeth it hath done no sin. These are the
dirty kisses the goodly will neither censor nor ban.
Like their product, syphilis, they are too filthy for
holy mouths; therefore shall we legislate only
against the natural and the clean.
And the real kisses of affection do not come in
here because they are the kisses of home; mostly
the kisses of those delicious things, children —the
best time-payment furniture any married pair can
buy. The mere fact that, just as the last instalment
of the purchase is paid on them, they are discov-
ered to be children no longer, and prepared to
belong to some perfect stranger, does not matter.
The man whom a child’s kiss cannot lead is a bad
man, or at least a careless man, passing the real
gold of life for the lead of it. But what shall be
said of him who shall propose to limit children and
their kisses by limiting the kiss of tender love —even
the kiss of clean passion? To perdition with the
film censor who would limit even a film kiss to
10ft. 1
Ten feet seems a lot; but it isn’t. To say that a
girl’s mouth is two inches wide, and that in kissing
it 10ft. you kiss it 60 times, is merely Dutch calcu-
lation. Quantity of kisses is not so much as quality.
Tennyson, who was a warm old gentleman before
he wrote the foolishness of Victoria being “pre-
eminent in grief,” or such banality as “The village
ne’er had seen a costlier funeral,” wrote of the kiss
splendid—the kiss that drew the girl’s soul through
her lips, while the active partner was as-one drink-
ing dew. This kiss (and I speak from research
made merely for the purposes of this article) cannot
be done in less than lmin. ssec. And the Elders
and the Pharisees would limit us to 10ft. !
Love cannot be measured with thimbles. Ten
feet? Ten feet measured by film-time is ridiculous,
llorghly, one can say that a motion-picture runs
17min. to the thousand feet; a little less than a
foot to the second. So these fools of Ohio think a
man is to be put off with a lOsec. kiss —a mere
peck for a curate. The kiss that means business
must run at least 50. I have heard of one of 2min. ;
but the watch was said to be not certainly reliable.
This is a subject of tremendous importance affect-
ing the welfare of the race ; affecting, by the gods,
the continuity of it. And if I were to approach it
without due reverence I would be in danger of a
beating from women; and would deserve it.

more serious than, syphilis. Norris points
out that of about 500,000 prostitutes in the
great cities of U.S.A. it is estimated that
40,000 die annually, one-third of the deaths
being due to gonorrhoea; and Nkisser main-
tains that. 30 to 50 per cent, of all childless

balance with its devilish mock modesty.
An Expedition to the Hun’s Vitals.
The newspapers went to press this week
with headlines which at last meant some-
thing. The British and French armies had
moved towards the enemy over a front of
25 miles in Northern France. The long-
looked-for offensive had commenced, and
artillery was turning the line thereabouts into
a hell. What this offensive will lead to is not to
be decided in a day or so. The great issue
to be determined is not whether the Allied
troops will push the German bag and bag-
gage out of Belgium before Sunday morning,
but whether control of the military situation
is definitely passing into the hands of the
Allies. Along part of the Russian. front
it seems to be certain that the Bear is get-
ting the upper hand. The Italian is hitting
back hard and effectively in his section of the
disturbance. At Verdun the French are
holding the enemy at bay. . If they
all continue to do these things, and
if the British attack achieves solid
strategical advantages, then, for . the
first time since the war began, will it be
possible to say with truth that a hole is
being bored into the Hun’s armor. But it
would be unwise to expect spectacular vic-
tories or to count upon progress being any-
thing but slow ; for the German has still a
powerful punch and the job of him
down is one of tremendous difficulty.. lliat
he is sorry he ever started the gigantic
struggle, tjiat what are vaguely de-
scribed as “things” are in a bad way
behind the Rhine, and that the Prussian
dream of world-wide Imperial glory lias
changed into a nightmare of ash-heaps and
cemeteries —all this is probably true. That
the German populace has had to take up
more than one hole in its belt and is growing
restive is also very likely. But mere contem-
plation of these circumstances is not going to
bring that crushing defeat of. the German
arms which alone would achieve a peace
worth having. The Hun can be relied on to
fight hard, for a long time yet, and the Allies
to encounter desperate resistance. Another
thing that can be relied upon is that when
the Hun is rooted out of Belgium and France
and Poland he will be suffering . from a
broken back, for he has dug himself in deeply
there, and the last thing he wants on earth
is to fight on German soil. The battles now
raging have a deep interest for Australia, as
Bieljim is somewhere handy, and the people
at this end of the world are occasionally able
to get some incredibly pulling accounts of
how he is getting on. The encouragement
given to recruiting by these fatuously-inad-
equate scraps of news is indescribable.
Corporal Robert Bowling, the fifth son of
ex-Premier Wade’s turbulent old friend
Peter to go to the Front,, was farewelled

Half a dozen early inhabitants of Victoria
have just died within a few days of one
another. They were William Anderson (73),
pioneer of the meat-canning industry and
founder of the Flemington Meat Preserving
Co.; J. S. Peterson (82), brother of the late
Franklin Peterson, who came here in the
goldfield days, started as an importer, and
was later a manufacturer and one of the
founders of the Australian Club; Auguste
Fisher, artist in stained glass; G. L. Mit-
chell, a pioneer of the ironmongery trade; B.
Richards, who came to the goldfields 65 years
ago, and later owned the biggest dairy in the
State; and John Inglis (89), part-owner of
the first line of sailing vessels to run
between Melbourne and the Gippsland Lakes.
South Aus. thew out a surprisingly
strong batch of 70-year-old public servants
on July 1. The foremost is A. B. Moncrieff,
Railways Commissioner, who did his best
work long ago as Engineer-in-Chief. Another
is Sholl, chief secretary to 14 different Chief
Secretaries. Harry Blinman, the old crick-
eter, is his direct successor, though Sincock, of
the Government reporting staff, becomes
secretary to a new-formed Premier’s depart-
ment. Exit also “Captain” Matthews, who
has had a quiet time as Inspector of Mines,
after a lively one in Westralia as the first
manager of Bayley’s Reward ; and Raymond,
Commissioner of Police (succeeded by In-
spector Edwards), with G. L. Reed, his secre-
tary, and Burchell and Bennett, veteran in-
spectors ; and Stanton, secretary to the Edu-
cation Department; and Iloltze, head of the
Botanic Gardens, whose place nobody seems
to know how to fill, so that he has stayed on
in it till he is close on 77. Reckoning in the
recent vacancies on the judicial Bench, no
S.A. Government ever had so many promo-
tions to hand about in so short a time as
Crawford Vaughan’s.

Melbourne, which was lately said by its
own immortal Melba to be “musically
starved,” is still being served with a good
square meal by Marlow at the Princess’s.
Last week the Gonsalez Co. added
two more productions to the menu.
The more charming of them was the
less rushed —for strictly unmusical reasons.
“TJn Ballo in Maschera,” sweetest ofVerdi’s
operas, had never been popularised in Aus-
tralia by any previous company or particular
aria. When Simonsen’s Co. played it long,
long ago the tenor was not first-class, and
when the Williamson Italian crowd tackled
it in 1901 the baritone (Cattadori) was no
great shakes. Now, the two principal men
are of first importance in “Un Ballo.” The
tenor is an amiable Duke, who makes
warm platonic affection to the baritone’s
wife, the man with the heavier voice being
the Duke’s faithful Prime Minister. In the
first place the loyal baritone stands between
his liege lord and the male chorus of
murderous conspirators, but when he finds
that his wife has been wandering down the
mountain side with his royal master, and the
conspiring chorus chaffs him concerning his
misplaced confidence in the fond couple,
Prime Minister Renato joins the conspiracy
and assassinates the Duke. After which he
discovers that his worst suspicions were ill-
founded.
* * * X-
“Un Ballo” proved to be the most satis-
fying of the Gonsalez Co.’s efforts up to
date. True, the chorus was comparatively
thin, and the chorus’s courtly costumes sug-
gested a draper’s bargain-counter; also the
voice of Miss Russ, who played a lurid clair-
voyant, w y as as nondescript as usual. But
Scamuzzi, in the baritone part, which has
the one famous aria in the opera, sang as
forcibly as he acted, whilst Capelli, always
richly melodious and sincere, made an unim-
peachable Duke. Cacialli, as the chief
plotter in black velvet, sang well enough to
atone for the foggy utterances of the other
basso. Mrs. De Revers was intensely emo-
tional and fairly sopranoic as the Wife

SYDNEY ROYAL.
Licinius Harry Sweeney persuades a small
boy to disclose the secret meeting place of

who Didn’t, and little Miss Visoni (the
Nedda in “Pagliacci”) revealed a delight-
fully fresh, sweet and keen soprano voice in
the part of Oscar, the page. She looked
very unlike a boy page, but she sang like a
bird. The effect in a couple of concerted
numbers, with Capelli ' and Scamuzzi as
chief colleagues, was quite beautiful.
In “Rigoletto” the honors were with Miss
Gonsalez as Gilda and Filippini as a rather
light and waspish kind of jester. He did
very well, though there was not much weight
in his wrath and despair, and the music of
the name part isn’t as grateful to a sugary
baritone as that of the sympathetic papa
in “Traviata.” Still he and the prima donna,
whose warble (except that it was occasion-
ally “off” in intonation) was as sound as a
bell, won an encore for the quartet in the
last act, tenor Lois and Miss Russ seeming
of less importance to the combination. Lois
was just a nice young duke and a pleasant
vocalist. Cacialli presented a smooth,
matter-of-fact Sparafucile, the professional
cut-throat, who delivers corpses at 15s. a
head whilst you wait, and charges twopence
extra for the sack. “Rigoletto” is far from
being the best of the co.’s performances.
“Tosca” is the only novelty promised for
this week, revivals of previous operas being
in constant demand.

On Saturday the prompter played bril-
liantly at Sydney Royal, where Julius

bodyguard.
Kniglit is steering his generally capable co.
through a quick-change season. It was
“The Sign of the Cross,” and besides Julius
only one knew his lines. These two and
the gifted prompter carried the play between
them, and the other principals, _ who were
mostly playing hopscotch and spinning tops
when Julius Superbus was going to the lions
with Ada Farrar years ago, had to have the
missing words put into their mouths like
plums. The revival is quite satisfactory
otherwise. The starlike gaze of Mercia
(Lizette Parkes) is one of the inspiring
things about the production. If such beauti-
fully-laundered visions drifted past the
garden gate on Sunday mornings, the par-
son’s collection-plate would have to be a
tray. Atholwood scored again as the hor-
rible old Christian-catcher; and Knight’s
famous legs wear so well that one suspects
him of having lured Time down an alley
years ago and finished the old fellow with a
sword. “Under Fire” will crackle on Satur-
day night.
“The Quaker Girl” will expire once more
on Friday night at Her Majesty’s, Sydney.
It is being done to oblige “The Merry
Widow,” who will prance again for 12
nights only, beginning on Saturday.
“Peg o’ My Heart is getting ready to paste
fresh labels on her travelling trunks. The
100th Sydney Palace performance will be
given on Monday, July .10; after that there
will be only nine more nights in the bosom
of the cold English family.
A welcome relief from the American farce
is promised for next Saturday at Sydney
Criterion, when a U.S. light comedy, with
the Australian title of “The Boomerang,”
will afford Myrtle Tannehill, Hale Ham-
ilton, and—it is to be hoped—the inimitable
Donald Bowles, a chance in something differ-
ent. The last cake of No. 13 soap will be
sold on Friday night.
At Sydney Adelphi Wish Wynne con-
tinues to charm with her exquisite little
sketches of English life. The rest of the
Ben Fuller show comprises an assortment
of mostly-acceptable vaudeville items.
The Follies have gone from Sydney Tivoli
to Maoriland, and the theatre is now yawn-
ing for wizard Horace Goldin, who is due
on Saturday at the matinee with his
masses of gear and his 35 assistants. Faith
moves mountains, and the illusionist who
shakes Faith has to move mountains of
props.
Paul Dufault, now singing triumphantly
through a return season at Sydney Town
Hall, has two more concerts to give—to-
night (Thursday) and Saturday. If the
writer had, instead of a press ticket, a mean
employer called Peter, he would cheerfully
rob him to go and hear this supremely
artistic Paul. And there is a Pauline, too
—Miss Bindley, of Bendigo, who has im-
proved so much that she is nearly bright
enough now to be a star.
At Melbourne Royal they were to revive
“Madame X” on Wednesday and present
Madge Fabian as that disreputable divorcee
for three nights only. On Saturday, for
the first time in Australia, the actress with
the Roman name plays the heroine in
“Romance,” said heroine being “an Italian
prima donna with the hot blood of the
Tuscan in her veins.” Melbourne is looking
for that sort of girl. Too many of them,
alas! have only the cold straw of the Tuscan
in their hats.
* *
Another first production is due in Mel-
bourne —at Her Majesty’s—on Saturday.
The co. at present concerned in “High
Jinks” will explain the true significance of
“To-Night’s the Night.”
*❖ * *
At Melbourne Auditorium, where Evelyn
Scotney has been trilling her lay with cap-
ital results, artistic and financial, the two
Russian musicians, Mirovitch and Piastro,
will give further recitals to-night (Thurs-
day) and Saturday. Mirovitch is a pianist
of the poetic order who can be brilliant
when a Liszt rhapsody gets him going, and
Michael Piastro is somewhat of a wizard
on the violin. Given a little more personal
magnetism and unctuousness of expression
he would make an audience jump, for be is
a master craftsman and his tone is always
sweet. The violinist plays from memory,
accompanied by his partner. The combina-
tion started last Saturday night with the
Kreutzer Sonata, and in this the two young
men were individually and jointly delightful.
Also the new Chappell instrument that
Mirovitch stroked and tickled gave emphasis
to the fact that until such time as Aus-
tralia ceases to import pianos at all she
will not need to get another box of music
from Germany.
** * *
At Melbourne King's “Duncan McClure
and the Poor Parson” continues to furnish
views of several unreal Scotchmen—
“unreal” because, in spite of their names
and their general canniness, none of thejn
mention Bobbie Burns. Steele Rudd ought
to remedy this omission by presenting the
Bert Bailey co. with the complete works of
the poet.
** * *
Mankin, a weird contortionist; Maximo,
a slack-wire wonder ; and Les Legarte, two
French head-to-head balancers, are the most
recent acrobatic additions at Melbourne
Bijou. Laurence Johnstone, the ventrilo-
quist, has reappeared with his mechanical
accomplice, whose language needs a little
pruning in places; and Phil Percival capers

the entertainment is still provided by
Clement May in an unusual array of
Dickens portraits.

A brief trampoline act by the Bouncing
Brooklyns is the only new feature of im-
portance at Melbourne Tivoli. The rest of
the programme is supplied by Norton and
Earl, the three Kundles, Baslo and Yivi,
Gardner and Revere, Mary Dorr, Jimmy
Fletcher and two or three others. The
Kundles, the tight-wire trio, and Fletcher,
the contortionist, are about, the best, while
Gardner and Revere, described as the
“comedy couple who score bushels of
laughter,” seem least entitled to reap the
harvest.
Of an art show:—
The art of Frederick McCubbin and son is getting
another advt. at Melbourne Athenaeum. The old man
has most to say in the show, son Louis being nudged
into a corner with instructions not to interrupt. As
a matter of fact, sonny’s haystacks and mine-views
make a meek appeal beside dad’s acres of radiant
scenery. McCubbin, senior, is ever a spring and
summer fancier, and his landscapes, ranging in size
from the huge “Old Fence” to moderate canvases like
“The Creek” and “Bush Hut,” nearly all record gala
days in the brightest part of the calendar. It is a
handsome exhibition of greenery and sunlight, but it
seems to demand a stronger human accompaniment.
Mac. puts figures into his larger efforts without in-
creasing their interest or variety, blit omits popula-
tion from his small flowered spaces, though they
look as if they were made for picnic parties and
awful orgies of sandwich and tea. In the meagre
non-landscape section of the show the painter’s cold
decorum in portraits Nos. 1 and 6 is much to be
preferred to the genre jauntiness he displays in the
mistakes labelled “Interior” and “Shelling Peak”

Bornhold’s personally-directed film-story a

Preached the last sermon at Armidale
(N.S.W.) on July 2, Bishop Coopei’, who
had worn the Anglican gaiters there since
1901. Cooper was born in England in 1849,
and after climbing up to an M.A. degree at
Trinity College, Dublin, came to Australia
as a young curate in 1874 with Dr. Thorn-
ton, who was imported in that year to bish
in the then newly-formed diocese of Ballarat.
Thornton, by the way, is still alive in Eng-
land, aged nearly 90, and married a second
wife a couple of years ago. Coopei], who
never married, stayed in Western Vic. for
27 years, becoming Archdeacon and subse-
quently Bishop-Coadjutor of Ballarat. _ On
Thornton’s departure, Ballarat Anglicans
chose Green, who then bished at Armidale.
to succeed him, and Cooper went to fill
Green’s gaiters. Business ability was his
strong suit as a bishop, and for many years
he had been chairman of committees in
the Anglican General Synod, of which he
had been a member since its birth.
The Defence Department was probably
right in deciding that Australians who have
enlisted in England should not be per-
mitted to exchange to the Australian forces;
but in defending that stand it was quite
unnecessary to reflect on the British army:
In connection with the British army, the same
rigid standard in the examination of officers was not
observed as that which obtained in the forces of the
Commonwealth. In Australia, commissions were only
granted after a strict examination: but in Great
Britain commissions in some cases had been granted
without examination.
It may be true that commissions are not
granted in Australia without examination;
but it was to. say the least of it unfortunate
that, simultaneously, the Soldier, the offi-
cial voice of the powerful Returned Sol-
diers’ Association, should declare it about
time commissions went by merit, and not
as the result of seeing So-and-so.
E’rom the Office Curate :—-
The Synod committee offered the job of Bishop of
Ballarat to Maxwell Homfray Gumbleton, formerly
Smith, who is vicar of Chippenham and rector of
Ilardenbuish, in Wiltshire (Eng.) ; and as the net
returns from his two collection' plates, put together,
only amount to £435 a year, while the Ballarat
gaiters are worth £lOOO, of course he heard the call.
Born in 1872 in Jamaica, where his father, an English
barrister, had a Judgeship, he was schooled in Scot-
land; struggled up to a bare pass degree at Cam-
bridge, without any honors or prizes; served his

time as curate, meanwhile marrying Ella Maria, his
rector’s daughter; and first got a parish of his own
18 years ago. There are three sons —the eldest
now in Flanders —and one daughter. You can almost
hear him saying to Ella Maria last winter, “Really,
my dear, what with the children growing up and
this dreadful war-time taxation, I’m afraid we can’t
go on like this: I shall be compelled to take some-
thing in the Colohies !” The Melbourne papers call him
“Canon,” but his canonry is only an honorary affair,
quite worthless as a distinction and not carrying
the title, except by courtesy. He was once chaplain
to (hats off!) “the high sheriff of Wiltshire,” and is
still chaplain of the local workhouse; and when
such “distinctions” are aU that can be said for a
man, he is pretty obscure.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“T. 0.1.” : W. H. E’ord, the reputed “Father
of the Stage,” died last week at
(Vic.), ip his SGth year, lie had been an
invalid for many years. Born in London, of
theati’ical parents, in 1830, he was on the
stage at Astley’s at seven years of age. In
MICHAEL PIASTRO, Violinist, and
ALFRED MIROVITCH, Pianist.
the late ’forties he came to Sydney and
applied for employment at the Victoria, then
open only three days a week. The caretaker
advised him to look for some other job, as
the stage meant starvation in Sydney. So
he went on a station in what is now Queens-
land ; and at Christmas he converted the
woolshed into the Theatre Royal, Tarampa,
for the amusement of the Cameron family
and visitors. Several entertainments were
given, and two cattle-buyers from Brisbane
advised him to start shows in that township.
On this suggestion he built the first theatre
in Brisbane, and later another in Ipswich.
Thus he drifted back to Poverty Point. When
Johnson built the old Scandinavian Hall,
Gastlereagh-street (the Sydney Tivoli is now
on the site), W. H. Ford became the mana-
ger. Prior to that he had been associated
with G. V. Brooke, and later with Barry
Sullivan, as costumier. He tried Maoriland
with Clarence Holt in the early ’sixties, but
the climate crippled him. He had numerous
children well known in the profession, among
them George, Jack and Cyril Ford, Mrs.
G. P. Carey, Mrs. G. Lister and Mrs. Allan
Hamilton.
“Dx-y Shave”: An appeal to Jimbill to
come to the circus-
Some horses will make a very good tricks.
The klown will come and talk with that horses,
therefore audience will laugh itself very much.
The lady will walk on horse’s back, and horse is
jumping very much also.
The klown will make a joking words and lady will
become too angry, therefore klown will run himself
away.
One boy will fall a ball from top, then he can
catch that ball before that ball can fall.
This is the very better jumping trick.
Nearly as definite as Pearce speaking about
conscription.
Tom Pollard, who nowadays x-uns a M.L.
West Coast pictui’e-show, is taking a holi-
day, and is spending it in rehearsing a
Christchurch crowd in “H.M.S. Pinafoi-e.”
It is just over 35 years since the first Pol-
lard Lilliputian Opera Cos. struck Maori-
land. Arriving at the Bluff, two days later
the co. opened with “H.M.S. Pinafoi*e” at
Sloan’s Theatre, Invercargill. Tom Pollai’d
was stage manager and Fred Duval repre-
sented the old firm of Dunning and
Reynolds, who in those days had a fixun grip
of the leases of the principal M.L. theatres.
The following was the cast: Sir Joseph
Porter, Maud Pollard; Captain Coi’coran,
Herbert Salinger; Ralph Rackstraw, Con-
nie Osmond ; Dick Deadeye, Dick Osmond;
Boatswain, Joe Sheehan; Boatswain’s Mate,
Albert Goodwin; Buttercup, Olive Pollard;
Cousin Hebe, Lena Salinger; and Josephine,
May Pollard. The musical conductor was
J. J. Pollard, jun.; the leader of the
orchestra, C. A. Pollard; the pianist, Alice
Pollard; the organist, Nellie Pollard; the
flautist, Fred Pollard. The list only wants
somebody called Bran to make it read like a
market report.
“Stargazer”: She had made quite a com-
motion in the vaudeville world at the outset,
and she went on occasioning considerable
noise. Then because it was always the same
noise people got tired, and began to betray
a willingness to let her go off when she was
through with her programmed items. There
came a time when an infinitely better artist
who created no particular atmospheric dis-
turbance took well and gave pleasure to all.
The new one became a subject of general cop-
versation, and the house was loaded nightly;
but the old one still acted as if confident
that she was the responsible person, making
little glad speeches thanking everyone for
coming to see her. “This crowded house
speaks for itself,” said she. Eventually the
house did speak for itself. “There are
others!” it said. She was equal to the occa-
sion. “But they can’t keep you away!” she
cried. At this stage the management inter-
vened and barred speeches.
“Glen Huntly”: The noisiest perform-
ances of Italian opera I have heard are
l ' those now being given at Mel-
bourne Princess’s, not because of
what is done on the stage, but
because of what happens off. At
“Gavalleria Rustic-ana” I was
forced to the conclusion that the
Gonsalez Mutual Improvement
Society was holding a Mock Par-
liament behind the scenes. Some-
times a gentle buzz like “the
murmur of lonian bees” was
wafted from the wings, but now
and then the sound would swell
to something like “the hoarse
magnificence of rushing stones,”
punctuated by barks and yelps.
Most of the chorus, too, seem
lately to have had their boots
half-soled and heeled, it being a
long time since we’ve seen any-
body who could get off the stage
with more noise and remain off
less silently. If the row went
on at some shows one could name
it would not matter ; but just at
present nearly all the people at the Princess’s
happen to be worth listening to.
“Stargazer” : “Quinney’s,” produced at the
Repertory Co.’s new Playhouse (Melb.),
may be quoted with several other McMahon
productions as an example *f the danger of
the Repertory drift towards puerility in its
quest of something entirely different. The
aim of the Repertory Cos. is to be different;
but if the difference entails a conspicuous
inferiority, there is no occasion for this new
movement to assert itself. There was noth-
ing in “Quinney’s” but the fair acting of
Arthur St.van as J. Quinney, and the com-
mercial theatre has given us many oppor-
tunities of seeing the good acting of Arthur
Sty an. “Quinney’s” is a thin comedy—at
any rate, it appeared thin to attenuation as
presented-—with a vagueness in the char-
acter-drawing that even an experienced pro.
like Styan could not quite cover up. If.
after all, there is so little meaty material
for a repertory theatre to operate upon that
recourse to rather mild dramatic renderings
of small family grievances like “Quinney’s”
is necessary, the movement is not going to
contribute to our happiness and uplift as
liberally as I once fondly imagined.
An Australian’s letter from London :—-
One day who - should come along hut Corporal
Hareourt Beatty, home from France on seven days’
leave from St. Eloi! He looked a picture of health,
and younger by years, and he’s 51. Before he
joined he was doing special-constable work for
months—after the show at night, from 12 till
four. That’s what I call a man. I hope to Heaven
he comes back safely at the finish. Another Aus-
tralian player who joined here is Cyril Bell, who
married Mrs. Robert Brough. Bell is now a sub-
lieut. on H.M.S. Hermione. Before getting his
naval appointment he served with Kitchener’s Army
in the north of France, all through the Armen tiers,
Ypres, La Bassee and Loos affairs. His division
was in the thick of it at Loos. While out there
he got his call from the Admiralty. One English
mummer who came tearing home from the States
to get into it was Pope Stamper, a great favorite in
musical comedy in U.S'.A. His wife is a niece of
Emma Temple, Bessie Major and Mrs. Brough.
Stephen Phillips, poet and playwright, of
Britain, dead a while back, left a fortune of
£5, and no will to dispose of it.
“Lantern”: As I turn the handle, it seems
to me that Chaplin is at last tiring of his
library of monkey-tricks. I saw him last
night in one disconnected chapter of a stupid
and confused serial which ended with him
hosing an entire company. It wasn’t funny;
it was merely pathetic. Perhaps the poor
scenario had depressed the modern Grim-
aldi ; or maybe it is the languor of riches
that is slowing him down. If the new him
firm which bought him at boom rates can t
get better stuff out of him, I don’t like the
promoters’ chances of making a fortune.
Anyhow, the world deserves a change from
Charley.
(Continued on page 26.)
Adelaide had four inches of rain in the
last week of June, which made it the wettest
week for 40 years; and Sin. for the month,
which made it the moistest on the entire
local record.
These are cold days for dance-giving
bachelors of military age. At Lithgow
(N.S.W.), when the hosts of a “bachelors
ball” in the town hall arrived at the scene
of the intended shivoo, they found the hall
tastefully decorated with recruiting posters,
kindly contributed by their lady guests as a
relief from the monotony of white feathers.
The orchestra expressed its feelings in the
matter by playing “Your King and Country
Need You” and “Boys of the Dardanelles,
instead of more hackneyed waltz tunes.
Altogether, the young men had . such a
pleasant evening.
The Hobart Bumbles intend to stick to
their war-time economy of saving £4OO per
year by removing garbage only once a week.
They are fortified by their health officer,
who says it really doesn’t matter whether
they gather up the muck once a week or
once a month as long as they follow the
present practice of dumping it all down in
a heap along the water-front of the town.
He has, on his own confession, been advocat-
ing a destructor for 18 years, but the same
old stinksome method is going strong, and
is good apparently for another 50 years.
A month ago this paper’s “Woman’s
Letter” mentioned the departure of the lady
who was formerly Gertrude Tait to join her
husband in London. Captain Lewis, who
set out for the war soon after it started,
had never seen his firstborn; and, as he
had arranged for furlough in July, Mrs.
Lewis went off to show him the family
treasure. How horrible war is! Mrs.
Lewis’s last weeks in Sydney were clouded
by the death of her brother, Lieut. Tait;
on her arrival in England by the Osterley
this week she will learn that her husband
was killed in action in France on June IS.
Ir; years past she was matron of the Thurs-
day Island and Darwin hospitals and was
superintendent nurse in Papua; and a mul-
titude of Northern men who have admired
her skill and courage will be full of sym-
pathy for her. Before leaving for the Front
Capt. Lewis was head of the Cable Guard at
Port Darwin.
“Croson”: Next to making me a bishop
(that’s a nice, clean, well-paid trade) I
always regret that my parents didn’t turn
me into a military officer, preferably in the
commissariat department. Then, in addi-
tion to receiving a good wage, I should
have the pleasure of spending huge sums of
money for which no one would ever call me
to account. Had such been my luck I would
have tried to emulate those who paid £214
for the hire of a horse, cart and man for
10 months, to now and then hump a few
rations to South Head fort, Port Jackson.
Of course four or five turnouts could have
been bought for the money, but then if you
buy a turnout you’ve got to feed the horse
and keep the cart in repair and mend the
harness. Besides, the horse might die, and
then you’d have to chase after another, with
a fair certainty of being taken in. It is
much easier to let somebody else worry—
especially about the bill.
After the German “victory” off Jutland,
the Imperial liar asked the small neutrals
to be glad that “the freedom of the seas”
had been restored. Precisely what the small
neutrals are to understand by “tlie freedom
of the seas” Dernberg, the German Secre-
tary for the Colonies, announced in the
Reichstag some years ago when Burns, Philp
and Cos. were struggling for the Pacific
trade:—
Australian competition in the South Seas is verj'
keen, and this competition will have to be driven
off the field. The N.D.L. has succeeded in driving
from the field very keen rivals for the +rade between
New Guinea and Australia—rivals who made it very
difficult for Germans to place their wares, and who
gave preference to English and Australian goods.
Dernberg asked for the usual subsidy and
got it. Also, by the way, the patriotic
shippers of Australia handed their usual
subsidy in the same direction, so that Ger-
man shipping in and out of Commonwealth
ports increased from 845,000 tons in 1909 to
1,211,404 tons in 1913.
Maoriland’s proposal to impose an addi-
tional rate on incomes exceeding £3OO found
Fat unperturbed. He put it thus to the
newspaper man: —
As to the burden of the taxation, I do not think
that the large companies will find it more than they
can bear. They have the old refuge—they can pass
it on to the public.
True patriots all, for be it understood we
theft our country for our company’s good.
AN UNPOETIC DREAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Rev. Canon Maxwell Ilomfray Gumbleton, selected
for the Bishonric of Ballarat, was formerly known
as Canon Smith, but changed his surname some time
ago in accordance with the provisions of a legacy.
The bishop erst was Canon Smith ;
But one among his kin and kith,
Who deemed his name of humble ton,
Induced him with a golden bribe
To drop the badge of all his tribe,
And dub himself a Gumbleton.
The name that I subscribe herewith
Has more renown, just now, than Smith,
Which is the least I’d say for it;
Yet, heedless of my noble blood,
I’d change my famous name to Mud
Did gold but pave the way for it.
By any other name this rose
Would bloom as fair in verse or prose—
A name's a paltry, penny thing.
If some bad uncle, deaf and dear,
Left me a thousand pounds a year,
The Court might call me Anything.

Canon Maxwell Gumbleton, viee.v of
Chippenham (Eng.), is to be the new Bishop
of Ballarat, succeeding Dr. Green, who
retired last year. A Board to make such
selections as this is kept alive in each dio-
cese, members being elected from time to
time by the local synod. But in the final
issue such Boards of course receive guidance
from Above. According to an interesting
romance in a Melbourne daily as to the
Board proceedings at Ballarat, no less than
12 names w T ere “submitted” for the con-
sideration of the selectors, eight of them
Australian and four English. Presently this
list was allegedly reduced to three—“a
bishop in Australia, a priest in Victoria, and
Canon Gumbleton.” Then the final choice
was made. As a matter of fact, no Aus-
tralian was ever formally considered for
the position. It was a very simple affair.
After the matter had remained open for a
time and been discussed openly and secretly
and in the street and in the vestry and over
the washtub and the walnuts, Gumbleton
was favorably mentioned to the Board by a
certain party. Whereupon everybody on
the Board said with one voice: “Why, cer-
tainly, if you say so!” —and Gumbleton it
was.
TIT FOR TAT.
“Come on now, Mac. Sing ‘A Man’s a Man

Out of a population of 1000 or so King
Island, the lonely speck in the middle of
Bass Straits, has sent 237 men to join the
khakis. It expects to send a few more, but
there are not many left now.
Hats off to the memory of a brave Aus-
tralian girl! Mabel Rimington, of Casino
(N.S.W ), aged IS, took little brothers Eric
(aged three) and Leslie (10) for a w r alk
along the river bank one evening last Octo-
ber. Eric fell in. Mabel jumped in after
him, and struggled with him to land, pushing
him far enough up the steep bank for Leslie
to clutch him and haul him up to safety.
Then Leslie held a stick to help her clamber
out; but knowing that her weight would
only pull him in, too, she said: “No, you
aren’t strong enough. Run home and get
help.” But by the time help came Mabel
had slipped back and was drowned. At a
public meeting in the Casino Town Hall
the other afternoon Bob Bell, of the North
Coast Shipping Co., and Charley Metcalfe,
a well-known Sydney citizen, acting on
behalf of the Humane Society, handed
Mabel’s family the Society’s certificate for
her bravery.

The latest casual Australian to be men-
tioned takes life easy in South Melbourne.
His name is Sharpe. On a recent evening
his wife told him she was going to a picture-
show. He made no objection, and went out
for a stroll. On returning he found her
lying on the bed, fully dressed, apparently
asleep. With gentle regard for her feelings
Sharpe retired to rest without disturbing
her. On waking next morning he found her
still in the same position. Unperturbed he
left for his work, and on coming back at
midday, although there was no meal pre-
pared and his wife had not yet altered her
position on the bed, he did not worry—lie
just went back to liis job. Coming home in
the evening, however, and finding things
exactly as he had left them, lip reckoned the
missus’s siesta was a bit too prolonged. So
he told her it was about a fair thing—
and discovered that she was dead. Since
then the female friend who was accompany-
ing Mrs. Sharpe to the theatre has informed
the bereaved husband that on the way to
the city his wife fell off a tram, she
brought her home and left her. Which
seems to have been a trifle casual, too.

“Quidani” : A word that is putting in a
lot of overtime lately is “traditions.” Even
Jellicoe remarks that “the glorious traditions
of the British Navy were most worthily up-
held.” Every day it is nointed out that
though something or other didn’t quite come
off, somebody or other upheld the glorious
. traditions handed down
by some dead person.
The glorious traditions of
the past may be right
enough, but such a lot
of inglorious traditions
handed down from the
«same dim period have
caused so much trouble
that nobody wants to lie
awake at night to do rev-
erence to the word. And
a whole lot of the most
inglorious were reckoned
glorious till they pulled
us right into the dirt.
There were, for instance,
those glorious traditions
about one volunteer being
equal to 10 pressed men,
and conscription being
necessarily inferior to the
British voluntary system
because it was adopted
by Continental Powers —
these and others have
served to humbug a na-
tion into allowing its
leaders to collect much
credit by doing little but
talk. Now that the Rus-
sians are doing some-
thing definite in the way
of advances, it is inter-
esting to note that the
cables don’t wax eloquent
explaining how the Bear
is upholding the glorious
traditions of the past.
The Bear’s traditions are
left alone, but nice, reas-
suring, solid facts are set
forth showing that he is
raising Cain in the way
he is wanted to. Until
business on other fronts
proceeds on the same
lines, no one wants to
have the fact that we haven’t advanced, or
have slightly advanced backwards, palliated
by reference to what our great-grandfathers
did.

“Petifi”: I notice that N.S.W. Justice
Harvey has been giving a Sydney girls’
school sartorial advice :
At the present time I see many women wearing
ham frills around their necks. I strongly advise you
not to wear them. A ham frill is only becoming to a
person with a face like a ham.
Would it be right to say, then, that no
person should wear a horse’s tail on his
head unless he has a head like a horse’s
hindquarters?
A HOPELESS ATTEMPT.
WAITER (as procession of three emerge from the supper-room of the Tear 'em Down
Football Club Social): “What’s up with him — ill?"
SUPPORTER: “ Now; turned up an hour after the shore started, and the blanky chump
tried to catch up!”
From Ted Colles :
His job was somewhere along a narrow, much-
used international waterway, and each morning the
patrols would report back to their headquarters,
which in turn would wire results to a greater
H.Q’s, which would consolidate the lot in one wire
to supreme H.Q’s —“Canal all clear,” or whatever
it might be. As often happened, there was some
delay the other morning in the arrival of the two
minor ll. Q’s reports; and while the sergeant
was roaring up the signal-office, Billjim, the new
office-orderly, was shuffling around with a home-
made birch broom. Came a sharp b-r-r-r! from the
’phone. Billjim woke up, dropped his broom and
grabbed the receiver. From the mightiest ll. Q’s
came a typical English staff-officer’s voice:
“Hi! Aaa-Aaa—aw —er — what 1 Is that So-and-
So head-quaata/is? Eh?”
“Yairs,” drawled Billj.
“Well, Ai saay, y’know! ” continued the voice
fiercely, “what th’ deuce d’you people mean! Thet
confounded canal report not in yet! And”
But Billj. wasn’t familiar with the canal-report
ceremonial, and said something to that effect into
the ’phone. There followed a passage Of vague and
unintelligible questions and answers, and the Voice
became more and more hysterical:
“Whai, demmitall, man ! Who are you ? D’you
know the taime? It’s after eight o’clock and you
haven’t got the confounded canal clear yet—-eh—
what t”
The dazed look on Bill’s face gave way to one of
desperate boredom.
“Gawstrewth! ” he drawled, “I got one scrag uv
a broom t’ clean this place with before eight
o’clock. Surely t’ cripes it ain’t my job t’ sweep
th’ blanky canal!”
A spluttering sound came over the wire—just as
the sergeant dashed in with a signal form in his
hand, and, shoving Billj. aside, grabbed the receiver
and saved the situation.
Next morning Billjim was requested into the
presence of G. 5.0.2, who held a memo, from supreme
H.Q’s in his hand, and there he received kindly
advice on the correct manner of conferring with
staff-officers in general, and Imperial staff-captains in
particular.

“Pat O’M.”: What sense is there in hav-
ing these public holidays in the mid-winter
months? Last week under a grey sky a
shivering few tried to feel glad while setting
forth on excursions to places where they
remembered the shine of the sun on happier
occasions. Even if the King did have the
doubtful joy of being born in the depth
of the Australian winter, why should loyalty

to his office or person demand a stoppage
of work at a time when the odds are against
me holiday-makers having a good time?
Why not take all these winter holidays out
of the calendar and pool them into one good
carnival in the spring? A carnival extend-
ing over several days in the time when
wattles stir the poet’s soul to make “dawn”
rhyme with “morn” might come to be a
feature of Australian life. The old Romans
knew the value of such a time for letting off
steam, and their example has been followed
in many European towns and villages all
through the ages. To go reasonably mad
for one- week in the year would be about
the best safeguard against going stupidly
insane for the other 51. Anyhow, holidays,
to do any lasting good, should be consumed
in pints, not nobblers. Put into a big
measure and filled with sunshine and frivo-
lity, we could keep all the commemorations
out of the business, and go on the honest
basis of taking time off when we wanted
it and not when an accident of birth, death
or marriage gave us the arbitrary call to
break holts with toil.

The Y.M.C.A. is now spending nearly
£lOOO a week in providing free writing-
paper and envelopes for Australian soldiers
in various parts of the world. It is figures
like these which attract the wealthy old
fellow who ordinarily has no time for any-
thing with a “religious” label, but in whose
well of sentiment a few pints of human
feeling still remain. As a result much of
the Y.M.G.A.’s war-cash comes from men
who haven’t seen the inside of a Sabbath
collection-plate for years.

“Truthful James”: Here’s another gritty
Anzac in the making. The other Saturday
night young Lovett, of Ardlethan (N.S.W.),
a boy of 18, tumbled off the back step of a
coach and broke his leg. The passengers
did not notice the accident, and the rattle
of an adjacent battery drowned his cry for
help. When he had steeled his nerves to
it. he crawled 300 yards over very rough
ground to the mine office and asked for
something to bind his leg together. The
sound leg was considerably worn during the
crawl, but the lad’s chief concern was the
expense his accident was thrusting on his
parents. A brother, by the way, went under
in Gallipoli, and his officer in a private
letter to the parents said their lad was one
of Australia’s gamest.

CYRIL EDWARDS, Manager
“Rifle Ranger” : On the march in France
the other day we passed through an Eng-
lish Tommies’ camp which was marked by
beautiful lawns, artistic arbors and rustic
seats. These lawns looked like corners of
some “swell” estate at ’Ome, and they cer-
tainly were a credit to Atkins. Then I
thought of the d —d bully beef and how
much better it would go with an onion or
a carrot grown on the spaces where
“fatigues” had been employed for months
raising grass and buttercups. I admit at
once that Major Fitzmontmorency is
entitled to his comforts, too —but bully beef
and onions! :

“Not-at-All” from the Bar table: —
The present congestion in the Ma State’s Supreme
Court, where the cause-list is never finished by the
end of the jury sittings and the Full Court finds the
greatest difficulty in disposing of appeal cases set
down for term, reminds ope of the remedy attempted
in England at the time of the 1831 Reform Bill.
About then the Chancery Court was thronged by
litigants seeking equitable remedies and seldom find-
ing them on this side of the grave. Lord Chancellor.
Harry Brougham made great efforts to clear away
some of the debris. lie sat all day and well into the
night doing his best to fulfil the promises he had
made as Radical leader advocating law reform. He
often sat on public holidays, and even dealt with
an important trust matter on one bright Good
Friday morning—which led an embittered critic to
remind him that he was the “first Judge in any coun-
try who has ever presided in his court on a Good
Friday since Pontius Pilate.”
Of the N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench, Pring,
J., is the only one at all likely to emulate the
keenness of Harry Brougham or Pontius Pilate.
Pring is as keen on his work to-day as a generation
ago when his zeal was the despair of the Junior Bar.
The wig least likely to do so is Justice Dick Sly,
whose successs at golf lends much lustre to the
Bench. Chief Justice Cullen does a big share of the
common-law work, and generally falls in for lengthy
resumption cases; but he never fails to cut out
Saturday-morning work. Gordon and Street, JJ.,
have the most varied duties, the former having re-
cently, within a week, sat in the Common Law,
Equity and Divorce jurisdictions; and the latter,
within 10 days, in Common Law, Equity, Bank-
i uptcy, Probate, and Admiralty. Ferguson does the
lion’s share of chamber work; and the two other
TOO DISCREET.
“He simply makes that piano talk. doesn’t
he?”
“Yes; I wish it would tell us some of his
past. I believe he is divinely wicked .”
Equity Judges, Simpson and Harvey, have heavy
lists, as a rule, although the former is ageing a good
deal, and is, in fact, about to retire.
The common-law business of the court is really
hung up by the numerous resumption cases on which
the superlative liar, the “expert”, witness, lives and
AN EXPERT.
DORIS (proudly): “I sold a couple of hundred buttons on my block, dad.”
DAD (grimly): “Did you! Well, see if you can sew just a couple on my pyjamas!”
moves and gets his living. What old Harry
Brougham, L.C., forgot was that speedy settlement
of litigation mostly satisfies no one, and does in fact
not produce a real settlement at all. And the Ma
State’s Court makes up in sureness for what it lacks
in speed, and that is not a bad thing. The remedy
for congested lists is not speedier justice, but more
Judges.
“Cutwater”: The Cutty Sark, the best-
remembered of the
old Australian wool
clipper ships of years
gone by, is reported
from Cape Town,
where she has been in
dire distress. A pass-
ing tramp steamer
picked her up at sea
with her masts gone
and towed her into
port. Built in 18G9,
the Cutty Sark on her
best sailing point
could race anything
then afloat. She held
the record of 863 as
a day’s run, equal to
15 miles an hour right
round the clock—-
mail - steamer time.
The old girl was
guilty of doing even
17J. In the ’nineties
she was sold to a
Dago and named Fer-
reria. Then from a
splendidly - furnished
clipper she became
such an ill-kept, dirty
old hag that a one-
time member of her
crew, coming across
her in London docks,
wore out his boots on
all the Dagos that didn’t take to the yard-
arm,'.:.

“B.B.”: There’s too much brain-fag about
this war. Just when I was hopelessly
tangled Sydney Daily Telegraph
(29/6/T6) rushed to my aid with the expla-
nation that “everybody knew that both
armies” (French and British) “were acting
in complete accord.” Now I know how we
stand; all mists are cleared away and
doubt is dispelled by the searchlight of
fatuousness or some such illuminant.
“Devilfish”: After about seven months on
the job and a good look at the N. S. Wales
trawlers. Prof. Flynn, the
Speck’s Royal Commissioner on
Fisheries, has told all about it.
He advises the Government to
charter boats or make contracts
with fishermen for a supply of
fish, to put up cool stores to
keep them in, and to open shops
or subsidise hawkers to dis-
tribute them. This is for a
start till the State can get
trawlers of its own, and Flynn
reckons motor-boat or steam
trawlers costing from £.lOO to
£2OOO each would fill the bill.
Where you can get a £2OOO
steam trawler in these days he
doesn’t tell. He says that
nearly all the Tasmanian fish
are suitable for canning, and lie
can only suppose that either
want of capital or lack of tech-
nical knowledge, or both, have
been responsible for the failure
of‘past ventures. In the case
of the cannery, now deceased,
at St. Helens (whose obituary-
notice appeared in The Bulle
tin recently) the canned pro-
duct was well up to the stan-
dard of the imported Yankee
article, and was greatly in
demand. Flynn says the Gov-
ernment ought to encourage can-
neries and the like, but omits
to mention how; and the how is
the really important thing in
these matters. In fact, it is
ostensibly to learn how that
Governments appoint commis-
sions. The man at the corner could tell
them the rest. <
* * * *
From one of TirE Bulletin’s Billjims in
France:—•
Away in the north we hear a rumble; gradually it
grows louder until we see the flashes of guns and
distinguish the ripping of bursting shrapnel. The
order is given to “stand to.” Two minutes and the
message is ’phoned back to headquarters, “Q Com-
pany all correct.”
The din is now terrific. More of our guns have
opened and are being answered by those of the enemy.
Shells are bursting over and behind our parapet, and
‘No Man’s Land” is as bright as day with flares from
either side. Orders are given to prepare for a gias
attack. Every man puts on his helmet.
Our breastwork trembles. A terrific roar and cloud
of dust tells that something has got pretty close.
At times our parapet is like a boat in a swell, it
rocks so much. My good cobber takes it smiling,
cracks a joke or smokes a fag, and sympathises with
the “poor blankers” on our left who seem to be
getting it hotter than we.
A message comes to take all casualties to the dress-
ing station. Thank God, we can report: “None so
far.” But in the next platoon a shell has come
through, blowing one man to pieces and wounding
two others.
Whatever the peril, the stretcher-bearers do not
tarry. The wounded are quickly administered first-
aid and carried back nearly a mile, along a trade
where there is practically no cover, and over which
shrapnel falls like rain.
The noise dies down and in 15 minutes all is quiet.
Excepting that the parapet has been blown in,
strewing bags and loose dirt everywhere, and that
our officer gives us the good word and hands each man
a liberal rum, one would never know there had been
anything doing. But we have been under fire for
an hour and a half.

The Dentists (Amendment) Act which
was due to come into force in N. »S. Wales
on July 1 is not very drastic legislation;
but it tightens up the law in regard to the
quack tootlismith. When the original Act
brought some kind of order into the unregu-
lated dental business, opportunity was given
to men who had been practising to become
registered; but it was found that so long
as the fang-pluggers did not claim to be
dentists, they could give the public H—l
and charge for it without registration.
Generally they ran their gilded Inquisitions
as “Dental Parlors” or “Dental Com-
panies” ; and the Law on occasional out-
breaks of activity used to send its emis-
saries to make sure the practitioners didn’t
want to call themselves dentists. If they
didn’t use the sacred word, they could do
what they liked with their customers’ teeth.
The new Act gives extra grace to the out-
siders : the man who has been practising for
five years may continue to do so for another
three, and then secure registration upon
passing some examination; but a fine of
from £2 to £2O will be waiting for any
other person who undertakes to repair the
public’s machinery.
“Enzedder”: Recently the Auckland
Star came out in a rash of headlines: “Had
to Surrender. Could Hold Out No Longer.”
Beneath there was an account of how an old
German resident in M.L. had been compelled
to apply to the police for assistance, owing
to his remittances from Germany having been
cut off since the war. As the old man is a
brother of Ballin, the Hun shipping chief,
the Germans will probably translate the
article, and point out that the impotent
English have been reduced to bragging about
such small beer.
EXTREMES.
MOLLY: “Pretty warm, that cat!”
D OLLY: “ You're right. Coolest customer I
ever met.”
“Bill Bedsox”: We had one of those
quiet but pretty weddings the other day. At
the time fixed for it neither the cake nor the
bride’s teeth had come to hand. However,
the absence of these odds and ends was not
permitted to interfere with the course of
events. Not having the teeth, the bride
didn’t want the cake, and she nodded and
clicked her tongue when asked if she would
have this man.
DRINKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The shortage of whisky is due to the fact that
the raw spirit is being utilised against the Allies’
enemies. It is being turned into a high explosive.
The whisky that I used to take
Now makes the guarded hillsides quake;
And spouting shellbursts on the lip
Of gunpits mark my morning nip.
The drink I used to take at lunch
Compels some frightened Hun to hunch
His shoulders now. I love to think
How little he enjoys his drink.
My “nightcap” ! Ah, they sleep too well
Who take that flaming draught from Hell!
As far guns roll across the sea,
I mutter: “Fritz! have one with me!”

Paris Nesbit, the brilliant Adelaide law-
yer*, is now much better in health, and it has
been represented to him that his reasons for
lately resigning his K.C.-ship were hardly
sufficient. So the S. Aus. Government has
formally rescinded its acceptance of his resig-
nation, and things are as they used to be.
Meanwhile his son and former partner, R. G.
Nesbit. has been appointed head of the new
Licensing Court.
SENATOR NEEDHAM (W.A.) at a
fancy-dress ball.
Maorilanders have been recalling a long-
ago tragedy in the Kitchener family. Lieut.-
Col. Henry Horatio Kitchener, father of K.
of K., owned a. property at Waihemo, Otago.
To manage this property his nephew, Captain
Henry Kitchener, who had sold his commis-
sion in the army, immigrated to M.L. with
his family. On July 1, 1882, while they
were asleep in their residence at Dunedin, it
was discovered by a belated citizen to be in
flames. Mrs. Kitchener and a baby were
saved by a policeman, and two of the boys
leaped to safety from a window ; but three
girls, Susan, Sydney and Edith, the oldest'
11, perished. Their father died two days
later.
BETTER THAN THE BEST.
FACETIOUS NON-BIDDER (to perspiring
auctioneer who can’t raise a bid for
dilapidated violin): “Is it a Strad?”
A UCTIONEER: “Oh, no, nothing like that!
It’s by a good maker.”
They are everywhere. A late mail
brought two letters from Sydney boys in
remote places—one from young Pursell, of
an old-established insurance-broking family ;
the other from Leonard Dodds’s son. The
former was with the Armored Car Section
which the British Navy has lent to Russia ;
the latter with a motor corps in East Africa
under Botha. Pursell had wintered in Lap-
land, the vessel in which he and his lot left
for Archangel having been caught in the
ice ; “Ted” Dodds wrote from the slopes of
Kilimanjaro, the snow-capped peak which
pushes itself up 19.000 ft. above the East
African plains. The usual heavy rains
had begun to fall in April, and the motor
corps was having a bad time in a country
described as very much like the N. S. Wales
North Coast, with the addition of monkeys,
humming birds, giraffes, various kinds of
buck, and flocks of canaries.
Jimmie Mirams, a remainder of the
Berry brigade who passed out in Melbourne
the other day, got off a fair retort now and
then. Just after Service bad been badly
dished, Mirams, on rising in the House, was
greeted with some jest about his lack of
inches. “Do not sympathise with me, gen-
tlemen,” lie said. “I am far from being as
small as my opponents feel at this moment.”
Visiting Ballarat as one of Graham Berry’s
bodyguard, be was the victim of various
practical jokes. On the first night some-
body placed an infant’s high chair on the
platform. conspicuously labelled. “For
Jimmie Mirams.” Jimmie, who had just
been made a father, gravely added the word
“Junior,” and took the chair away with him.
Ages of N. S. Wales Supreme Court
Judges: Chief Justice Cullen 61, Justice
Simpson 72, Justice Pring 63, Justice Sly

Justice Ferguson 54 and Justice Harvey 51.
Six out of the eight are natives of the Ma
State.
R. T. Vale, for many years a member of
the Vic. Leg. Assembly, died the other day,
aged 80. He was a brother of W. M. K. Vale,
who made more noise as member and Min-
ister. In fact, the noise was a riot in the
days of his beloved colleague, “Mint Sauce”
Jones.
A D.C.M. has been won by Sergeant
Charles Wheeler, 22nd Battalion Royal
Fusiliers, who 18 months ago laid down the
mahlstick for the rifle. Born in Dunedin,
Wheeler began to study at Melbourne
National Gallery nine years ago, and got
together enough money to take him to Lon-
don. He there displayed fine talent in draw-
ing and painting: one picture of his, “The
Poem,” was bought by the Felton Bequest.
His portrait of John Madden hangs m tne
Melbourne University.
Auguste Fisher, artist in stained glass,
has just died in an East Melbourne private
hospital. Like William de Morgan, the
novelist, Fisher, w r ho
came of an old French
family in Warwick-
shire, served articles
with one of the Cold
Land’s leading stained
glass firms, and
reached Australia 35
years ago. Literally
one of the illUminati,
he worked up in Vic-
toria, where he estab-,
lished himself in 1890,
a world-wide reputa-
tion. Ilis windows
adorn the Canton Club
and buildings in South
Africa and Maoriland,
and many a ray
serene that penetrates
Menzies, the Oriental
and Collins House
first passes through
Fisher’s glass.
Herbert Larkin, who
is to manage the new
Commonwealth line of
steamers, joined the
A.U.S.N. Co. as a
clerk in 1890, and by
1914 had climbed into
the Chief Clerk’s
berth, with charge of
all oversea business.
When the Hun broke
loose the Common-
wealth Naval Depart-
ment commandeered
him for transport
work, and later on
sent him to a similar
job in London.
. Among the first to wear the Home Ser-
vice Medal, issued' to those who have volun-
teered for active service but have not been
accepted because they are doing indispens-
able work in Australia, was Defence Min-
ister Pearce. He must have blushed with
conscious worth, in his prospective capacity
as a soldier, to be assured by himself, in his
official capacity as Minister, that his ser-
vices in this unconscribed Commonwealth
are indispensable.
Proof of the effect of the tropics on the
white man is supplied by the Crane family
of Singapore, to which belongs Captain
Joseph Crane, of the jailer William Mit-
chell, now at Hobart. His grandfather
went east as a young man and held out
against the climate till he was 98. But
the captain’s father was cut off when he
was 87, and the pernicious effect on the
third generation may be judged from the
fact that of a family of 14 only eight are
now alive, and the captain, who is next
to the youngest of them, is but 71.
When the late “Jimmy” Mirams passed
out, a Melbourne daily printed the state-
ment that the deceased was probably the
last of those who sat in the Vie. Parlia-
ment of 1874-1877. Forthwith a loud mur-
mur arose from a lot of old gentlemen who
objected to being treated as dead. Actually
six members at least of that Parliament are
on deck —John Gavan Duffy, Simon Fraser,
Thomas Hunt, Robert Murray Smith, Rob-
ert Walker and John Madden. The Chief
Justice, by the way, was well on towards
the front stalls by that time. Tn ” r -i bo
was Solicitor-General in the McCulloch
Ministry; and during ’76, when Janus Ser-
vice formed his second Ministry, the bright
young man was Minister for Justice.
A New York artist. Miss Frances Del
Mar, stepped off the ’Frisco mailboat Moana
when it arrived- at Wellington (M.L.) the
other day and inquired the way to the near-
est Maori pah. The lady has been given
the job of doing the mural decorations of
the South Sea Islands Hall in the N.Y.
Natural History Museum; and as she takes
her job seriously she didn’t want to merely
copy some photographs or do her drawings
from the unreliable tale of a tourist named
Silas I’. Fountpen.
William Longbottom, dead in Adelaide at
84, was one of the founders of the big firm
of Colton and Co.; his son. of the same
name, is still a director of Colton, Palmer,
Preston and Co. —the old house with a new
roof. Like so many other prominent South
Australians, he was the son of a parson,
the first of the William Longbottoms having
been shipwrecked on the coast of S. Aus. in
answer—so the Methodists of infant Adel-
aide declared—to their prayers for a
spiritual guide. What the shipwrecked
sailors thought about it is not recoided.
William D. Bear, imported from London
32 years ago to be supt. of the reorganised
lire brigades of Sydney, died last week,
aged 70. Of his first paid corps, formed
in July, 1884, there are four men still in
the service.
Dead on June 30, Russell Barton, at the
age of 85. At one time he represented the
men and sheep of the Bourke district in the
I.eg. Ass. He and his brother were pioneer
storekeepers at Cobar.
One Melbourne citizen who has been
watching the situation in the U.S. with
feverish interest is old Alexander McKinley,
of. Paunch. If the U.S. should be “dragged
into” the European disturbance on the side
of the Allies and the Americo-Mexican row
develops into a war, Mexico will be all
enemy country, or thereabouts. McKinley
is consul for Mexico and fond of appearing
in public in a lovely consular uniform of
black cloth covered with silver sequins and
braided as to the pants with broad silver
strips; and to throw this beautiful uniform
out of action would be nearly as bad as
death.
Died the other day, at Surrey Hills
(Vic.), Mrs. Bell, whose father, William
Harper, was a midshipman on the Bellero-
pbon when it took Napoleon across to Ply-
mouth before he was shipped to Saint
Helena. Harper came to Hobart in 1829,
and Mrs. Bell was born there. She was
taken to Victoria in 1838 and went to the
first school in Melbourne. Eighty-three.
The Tasmanian Uni., wanting a lecturer
in French and German, has replaced a Swiss
by a Dutchman. The new man is Isaac
Baamsdonk, who, having graduated at
Amsterdam University, tried for the
£ s degree in the East Indies rubber business.
Apparently lie failed, for latterly be has
been teaching, languages at Melbourne
Grammar.
From an old political hack :—•
Irvine, K.C., never looked less like an iceberg than
he does to-day. Of late years he has taken on
a well-fed, mellow appearance which quite belies
his nickname. After dinner, gently flushed with
dry ginger-ale out of a champagne-glass, he would
pass for a prosperous suburban mayor in his
prime—-except for the whiskers. Irvine never
sported any kind of whisker. Long ago, before he
reached Parliament, he was a tall, pallid, liolioW-
cheeked person who seemed to have a secret sorrow
gnawing' at his breast-bone; and his clothes, collars
and conduct gave him the air of an undertaker’s
assistant at cut rates. But he has got over all that,
and now looks every inch the political boss.
HOPELESS.
HE: “Will you give me no hope?"
SHE: “None whatever — I’m thinking of
accepting you.”
“Adel.”: A generation back there was
some talk in Adelaide over the three lawyer
brothers Downer conducting cases to be
decided by the fourth, who was S.M. and
Commissioner of Insolvency. A counsel son
has often “appeared” before a Judge father,
but it is doubtful if the position has ever
been reversed, as it is in Adelaide just now,
Paris Nesbit, K.C., being at the Bar while
his son, Reg., is Licensing Magistrate and

But ain’t the ’ero that I thought.
I gave Nell, with me fondest love,

To be ’er shinin’ knight.

at Sale Prices

IN JUDICIOUS SPENDING LIES THE
PRACTICE OF REAL ECONOMY.
THE present-day call for economy emphasises the inducement—a saving of 2/- in the £ which
ofleis in the reduction in price of all “Austral” Suits to Order during Sale Time, which
commenced on Wednesday, June 28, and continues till Saturday, July 22.
The actual money saved, however, would not represent judicious spending if the price reductions
merely meant a price reduction—but this Sale Time offer is not merely one of Tailoring at a lower
price, since it carries with it —not only a' plain promise—but an assured fulfilment in the truly-
enhanced values, quite irrespective of the price.
However much less might be paid during the Sale Time, the standard of “Austral”
Tailoring does not vary, so that the actual full measure of saving is at once shown
by a reference and comparison of the usual to the Sale price.
And because of this, those of our Customers who have asked for Suiting Patterns
prior to the Sale, do not need to send for a further range in order to take advantage
of the Sale prices which now prevail.
2** any as f. we ™ il } gladly send t 0 an y address, on request, a complete selection
ot Winter Suiting Patterns, with simple Self-measurement Form and Tape.
CARRIAGE IS PAID ON ALL ORDERS THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Last week General-manager Teece, of the
A.M.P. Society, completed 50 years of ser-
vice ; and the head-office staff and the dis-
trict secretaries met to tell him what they
thought of him, and in reply he told them
what he thought of them—though probably
on neither side was it quite what they have
sometimes told their wives. But, at any
rate, between them they have established a
brilliant record, making the A.M.P. the
greatest mutual office in the British Empire.
Fifty years ago the funds totalled £310,000;
to-day they are £35,000,000. Then there
were 0000 policies; now there are 450,000.
Meantime £20,000,000 has been distributed
in cash bonuses; that is to say, policy-hold-
ers have been enabled to buy £20,000,000
worth of insurance in addition to what the
premiums were calculated to return a tri-
bute alike to good management and the
healthiness of Australia.
The remarkable success of the A.M.P. is
all the more striking and instructive because
the society is a complete negation of most
of the principles upon which Australia has
in the past been governed. Until the last
few years the idea of public ownership has
had few influential friends. We have been
told that private enterprise and proprietorial
interest were the only things that could be
relied on to make a big commercial success
of anything. Yet the A.M.P. proudly adver-
tises 'the fact that it has no shareholders,
and upon this it relies largely for its custom.
The men who have made it a success have
got none of the profits of the business. They
have had their salaries and their pride m
the great institution —and no more. If there
ever was a shining example of the advan-
tages of co-operation it is here. Yet, curi-
ously enough, Australia is woefully bare of
co-onerative enterprises outside life insur-
ance ; with the result that, say, the farmers
of Australia, who can afford to waste money
less than almost any class, unnecessarily
pay away probably £750,000 a year. And
the people who talk most about the magnifi-
cence of the A.M.P.’s achievements don’t
raise a hand to help them.
And then there is the odious Freetrade
idea that the little local thing is not worth
making some small sacrifice for. Had Aus-
tralians been as loyal to Australian indus-
tries as they have been to Australian life
insurance there might easily have been to-
day a score of manufacturing concerns as
great as the A.M.P., and because of their
greatness working at so low a cost that they
could offer Australians equal advantages.
Further, there is absolutely no. reason why
Australia should not be also doing for itself
the whole of its fire insurance. Instead, foreign
offices have received wholesale support, and
until the last few years hardly anybody
turned into an Australian fire office because
it was Australian. In consequence there is
no huge Australian fire office; and because
they all have to struggle for business with 30
or 40 foreign competitors, costs are high and
rates are high. It is Australian property-
owners’ own fault that they are not enjoying
the same advantages that accrue to the life-
policy-holders, who, as mentioned above, have
received from this one A.M.P. office alone
£20,000,000 of cash bonuses in 50 years.
Finally there is the equally odious idea
that the foreigner can do the thing better.
Therefore we expect the Australian goods,
when we ask for them at all, to be cheaper
than the foreign stuff; and when we have a
big job to be done we import somebody to do
it—from the wearing of a bishop’s apron to
the construction or management of a rail-
way. Richard Teece, born in Maoriland,
was educated in Australia, and has spent
his whole working life here. The stair
which has helped him to achieve the A.M.P.’s
• great success is Australian, too. And nobody
doubts for a moment that when in April
next he retires, having reached the age of
70, an Australian will succeed him and set
about the great work of rounding up the
million and a quarter of Australasian people
who ought to be insured but still not.
From John I). Leckie: —
So that The Bulletin may add to its collection
of depreciated paper money I send one of the notes
issued by the tyrant Lopez during the Paraguayan
war in South America. It is interesting because the
case of Paraguay bears a curious parallel to that of
Germany. The note is for four dollars (about lt>
shillings at par), but before the close of the war it
was not worth more than the paper it was printed on.
And, as you will see, it wasn’t good paper.
The facts are as follows. In 1865 the South Ameri-
can republic of Paraguay became involved in war
with the combined forces of Argentina, Brazil and
Uruguay. Paraguay at that time was one of the
most prosperous and progressive republics in South
America. It had a larger population than Argen-
tina, and was ahead of that republic in railway con-
struction and internal development. Nevertheless
Lopez had to fight against great odds. But he had
been preparing for war for years, while the allied
"countries of Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay were
quite unprepared. On the outbreak of war a Para-
guayan flotilla invaded the Brazilian State of Matto
Grosso (nearly twice as large as N. S. Wales), and
occupied it with little resistance; and it was many
months before Brazil succeeded in regaining posses-
sion. To the southward Lopez himself, at the head
of 60,000 men, with 200 pieces of artillery, invaded
and over-ran the Argentine province of Corrientes;
then invaded Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul), where
later on one of his armies was defeated and compelled
to surrender.
Meanwhile the allies had been gradually collecting
troops, and Lopez, finding his communications threat-
ened, was compelled to retreat. For more than five
years Paraguay maintained the war against great
odds, more than once inflicting a crushing defeat on
the enemy; and the war was only ended by the
death of Lopez, who was surrounded and killed when
attempting to escape with the remnant of his army.
Paraguay’s war had points of resemblance to that
now being waged by Germany. Paraguay,likeGermanv,
was the aggressor; she also was surrounded and
blockaded ; she was at first successful in invading and
occupying enemy territory. Ultimately she was
forced to retreat, and was compelled to succumb to
superior forces, though only after putting up a
desperate fight. It was at this point that the papei
money, originally worth 16s. a sheet, fell to 2d. a
gallon.
There are many incidental points of resemblance.
For example, it is said that the Germans, owing to
shortness of metal, have melted down the church
bells for cannon. The same expedient was finally
adopted in Paraguay. On one occasion, when the
allied flotilla in the river thought itself secure, it
was surprised to find shells falling thick and fast.
A new heavy gun had arrived at the Paraguayan
front. This was known as “The Christian,” from
the fact that it was formed from old church bells.
So great was the scarcity of iron in the country that
the people, instead of hoes, were compelled to use
as a substitute the shoulder-blade of an ox tied to
the end of a stick. Soldiers were allowed extra
rations for any scraps of old metal found by them
.on the battlefield.
The translation of the inscription on the note
issued by Lopez is as follows:—“Forgers and their
accomplices will be prosecuted. The National
Treasury will pay to bearer the sum of four dollars,
value received.” But, though I relinquish to you all
my rights, I wouldn’t rely on the promise, if I
were you.

Financially there is almost as much differ-
ence between this co.’s summer and winter
as there is between a farmer’s seed-time and
harvest; and it is rather a waste of money
to issue half-yearly accounts. Compared
with the previous six months the past six
seem to have been most fruitful; yet run
back over the table, and it will be seen
that no summer term of late has given such
poor net results. On the whole, though, it
is surprising that the co. has done_ so well.
Three things must have been cutting in to
the business: (1) Westralia’s dull times, the
result chiefly of drought in the farming dis-
tricts one year and too much rain the next;
(2) the early closing of pubs, ostensibly on
account of the war; (3) increased taxes.
The taxation is not. however, very heavy
yet, and the collector will probably take a
deeper cut by and bye. For the past six
months £3026 is charged to Profit and Loss
as against £2045 in the corresponding season
of 1914-15.
The investor wants to know (1) dividend
prospects and (2) the security for the prin-
cipal. The net profits for the past 12
months were £45,379, and the dividends took
all but £9915 of it. As an adequate amount
seems to have been first written off against
depreciation, things could get a bit worse
without imperilling the present dividend.
And, though general conditions in Westralia
may improve, it is likely that conditions
won’t improve for ‘‘the Trade.” Westralia
has, by the way, a problem the same as Ire-
land. ’ Part of it wants one thing and part
of it wants another; and Scaddan settled
the matter just as Asquith proposes to settle
Ireland’s trouble —by letting each have its
own way. The referendum is a democratic
instrument, as Happy Jack, being a Labor
Premier, knows; but as Happy Jack also
knew, the Goldfields weren’t going to put
up with it. democratic or not. if it meant
that'the city people and the farmers would
shut the miner’s pubs at 6 o’clock. This is
going to make people think. If the Perth
suburbs and the farming districts have no
right to dictate to the Goldfields as to what
their drinking habits shall be —or, if you
like, if the South of Ireland has no right to
dictate to the North of Ireland as to what
sort of Government it will have —what right
has Chatswood and Lindfield and Ivillara to
dictate to Broken Hill and Surry Ilills !
Nevertheless, right or wrong, the Trade,
taking it all round, is going to have a tougher
time than it has had hitherto. No doubt it
will be able to make a bit more here and
there; but it can’t afford to annoy many more
people, because, if it does, nationalisation
will arrive for certain. And that will make
shareholders look hard at the assets of
brewery cos. Suppose they had to go out,
what would shareholders recover V That has
become a more important question in con-
nection with brewery investments than ever
it was. In this case just half of the total
assets are hotel properties at cost —£276,627.
This paper hasn’t the least idea what that
lot would be worth if the licenses were lost.
Yet while there are these risks, there is a
bigger chance that breweries will go on mak-
ing fat profits. The stock is, however, no
longer one for the helpless maiden aunt to
put her little lot into.

Reserves are described as nominal because
the assets include goodwill, lumped in this
unusual entry : “By original purchase at cost
from the firm of Swallow and Ariell of free-
hold lands, buildings, machinery, plant, etc.,
including goodwill.” That item has stood like
that, with £148,500 against it, for 28 years.
It would be interesting to know what the
machinery, plant, etc., taken over from the
old firm 28 years ago is worth to-day. True,
the whole of the property, in a lump,
may be worth more than it was in 1888.
This paper doesn’t know. Plainly a balance-
sheet with an item showing a valuation in
1888 is of precious little value as a guide to
the value of the assets in 1916.
The column devoted to profits indicates
that one can’t take much notice of the net
return in any single year. The eo. is a good
deal like the Australian wheat farmer in
that respect; there are fat years and lean,
and the best one can do is to strike an aver-
age over a sufficiently long period. The
great variations in this co.’s profits are
mostly the result of great variations also in
the price of raw materials. As an average
the dividend for 10 years past has been a
shade over 6 p.c. But the question arises
whether it is a fair thing in this case to
base one’s calculations on an average,
because there had been a steady rise from
1905 until 1915, and that was probably due
to more or less permanently improved condi-
tions. Certainly the business seems to have
increased very much during this period:

The increase in book debts and stock sug-
gests that the turnover has grown very
much: and of course that ought to mean
more profits. Incidentally, liabilities have
grown, too, but not in the same proportion.
Ten years ago the co. owed £73,402, and its
assets (including the £148,500 before-men-
tioned) totalled £267,757. At the end of
April, 1916, liabilities were £94,142 more;
but assets were £224,680 more. That shows
an improvement of over £130,000 in the 10
years. But it wasn’t all accumulated pro-
fit : £49,880 of it was new capital. Still, that
left £80,658 of profit made in the business
and left there during the last 10 years; and
even if this is earning only 6 p.c. it makes
it as easy to pay p.c. now as it was to
pay 5 p.c. 10 years back.

So the advances are a filth less than they

ought therefore to escape any bad losses even
if properties shrink a good deal in value, as
they are likely to; for on the old loans a
substantial sum will have been by now
repaid, while few fresh advances are being
made. But even new business shouldn t be
risky provided the society allows for the
likelihood of a fairly sudden slump. As tor
creditors they have no worries at all. Total
liabilities are only £15,137, and advances
alone (secured by mortgage) are more than
three times that much.

Just over 10 years ago the capital was
increased out of accumulated profits from
£9OOO to £lO,OOO, and since then another
£4OOO has been paid up in the sanw way.
Now another shilling makes the 20.000 oOs.
shares paid up to 15s. This shilling is, of
course, additional to the usual 10 p.c. which
will be paid to shareholders in cash. Capital
and reserves —together £30,602 —are repre-
sented by premises (£12,823),
and advances (£9898), and public securi-
ties; and they ought to be all right- the
estates in hand are worth £1,756,191; five
years ago they were £1,617,302 —which
seems to suggest that people who have made
this eo. their executor are not as
agreeable as they might be. Still, what
little movement there is is the right way.
Indeed, it is hard to conceive of the business
of a well-managed trustee co. falling away.
In any case the principal is always there:
for the trustee co. is in the happy position
of not having to sink anything in immov-
able stock or plant. ( #
Australia’s biggest butter-maker, the North
Coast Co-operative Co. (N.S.W.), manufac-
turn! only 8031 tons last half-year (to April
30), as against 4560 tons in the correspond-
ing part of its previous year. The profit,,
after making ordinary allowances for depre-
ciation, was only £3076; £2OOO of this was
appropriated for special depreciation, and the
balance was carried forward. Capital is
now £33,429; reserves of one sort and
another, £19,871. Put in another way. the
eo.’s very extensive plant represents the co. s
entire capital and assets and about £7OOO
of borrowed money besides. Liabilities of all
kinds on April 30 were £83,869; and assets
of all kinds, exclusive of the plant, were
£76.497 —mostly sundry debtors and stock.
The co. could well do with another £lO,OOO of
reserves; and it can only get them by hang-
ing on to profit.
Hard-up days with Adelong Estates
(N.S.W.) brought Cohen on the scene; but
of £15,000 borrowed only £3OOO now re-
mains to he repaid. A similar amount has
just been paid, but it was not met so easily
as was forecasted earlier in the year. To
drop from Sfd. ground to dirt carrying only
sufficient gold to pay for drinks was a nasty
bump ; though it is not the first the show has
administered. Another was when No. 2
dredge got on to a bar as barren as South
Head, and calls had to be forced to put,
finances straight. Values since then have
been :
Half-vear. No. 1 Dredge. No. 2 Dredge.

Oct., 1915 . . 6.581-1. 8.204-1.
Apl., 1916 .. 8.868 d. 11.204 d.
No wonder stuff of this grade not only shook
Cohen off the roof but put enough into the
purse to pay four Is. divs. and let the half-
year close with £9639 more assets than lia-
bilities. Still a handful is wanted because
No. 1 dredge has to get on to a profit-earn-
ing run of dirt, and No. 2 plant has to bucket
its way out of a mat of timber it has worked
into.

The Sulphide Corporation, which some
years ago promoted the Central Zinc Co. in
London and guaranteed it 5 p.c. for a period
which has just expired, proposed recently to
buy out the whole undertaking for £150.000.
The works are at Seaton Carew, in Dur-
ham ; and when Britain at last woke up to
the fact that she had a huge war job on
hand, the State took control of the plant.
That upset the purchase scheme; but a com-
promise has been arrived at by which (1)
a substantial part of the war profits of the
concern, instead of goinsr into the Empire
Exchequer, are made available for extending
the plant; and (2) the Sulptyde Corpora-
tion takes over the business and works for
50.000 pref. shares, 50,000 ordinaries and
£7500 in cash, plus 5 p.c. interest for the
year ended March 31. The business hitherto
has not been profitable, though results have

It’s the good turns that count in a power plant—-
had turns mean inefficiency and loss. “Chromol”
leather belting insures good turns all the time.
“Chromol” is mineral tanned and the fibre is longer
and stronger—it is durable, pliable and efficient
under the most severe conditions. Heat and moisture
proof, it does not readily deteriorate. The merit of
“Chromol” is being proved daily on many of the
most important drives in the largest mining plants
in the Commonwealth. A power and profit increaser,
“Chromol” should be installed in every mine. J. C.

Economy and reliability in your mine is the funda-
mental requisite for commercial success. B.T.H.
Motors, manufactured by the British Thomson
Houston Company of Rugby, England, bring the
work and the driving power close together, cutting-
out friction and belt slippage, and eliminating all
the wasteful part of mechanical drives. These ad-
vantages, together witli their big overload capacity
and sustained speed under the most severe conditions,
have won for B.T.H. Motors their world-famed repu-
tations for thoroughness and economy. The Aus-
tralian General Electric Company of Sydney and Mel-
bourne, who are the sole Australasian agents for
B.T.H. Motors, will at any time be pleased to extend
to you their assistance in proving how you can in-
crease both your profits and output by adopting
B.T.H. Motors.— Advt.

ALUMINOFERRIC is used by the Sydney Water
Board, New South Wales Public Water Supply Depart-
ment, and many country Water Boards and graziers
for precipitating impurities and clarifying water in
reservoirs, cattle dams, etc. It is simply thrown
into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal. One pound will clear over 2000 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Ilardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“The Ilardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.
The Austral Otis Eng. Co., Ltd., of Melbourne, are the
sole representatives for them in the Commonwealth,
and will be glad to forward particulars.— Advt. [1

Butler's tin, Torrington (N.S.W.), is in
luck, for the latest wire states that No. 1
dam is full and No. 2 is 'filling. Butler’s
expects to crush 350 tons per week, so a
return of 1 p.c. tin oxide will be profitable
if costs don’t exceed 14s. Still the market
for tin oxide is very uncertain. There are
50,000 shares.

Tributors working at 31Sft. in the Central
Red, White and Blue have given Bendigo
a thrill. The general idea was that the
co. had cleaned up all the pay stone south
of the famous shoot. However, Tonald
Enever went for a 50ft. tribute, and in-
stead of merely a crust secured a nice patch
of quartz. This brought the old brigade
back on the scene, and work north and
south of the tribute block reveals possibili-
ties that have restored the punting gang to
life. The co. has a second chance in the
shaft, and so may again stir up the line.
As it is, a lot of nibbling in Victoria Con-
sols and Ironbark scrip has taken place,
though there is no direct connection between
developments in these neighboring mines.
Consols at G4oft. are punching into the
west leg of a saddle, out of the cap of
which tributors to the south are beating
pay dirt. The Ironbarks’ flutter is on the
possibility of the crosscut at 810 ft. bunting
into decent stone in the formation below
the Central Blue reef. With three mines
pegging away, it is quite likely that some
cheerful bulletins will reach Pall Mall.
Bendigonians are offering up thanksgivings
because outsiders are buying up forfeited
scrip in veteran shows like Suffolk United,
Clarence and Sheepshead. The pluck of
these people deserves reward, for it isn’t
often that Bendigo lets go any stock having
a decent prospect.

J. Trevor’s costs sheet for the North
Nuggetty Ajax, Daylesford (Vic.), proves
that he does his bit to get the mine going
cheaply, but prospecting and development
alone have been gobbling up as much gold
as he is able to win. This means call-mak-
ing, with contracting to keep the pot boil-
ing. Deep sinking has not disclosed any-
thing fresh, and as the Central next door
is going ahead with that job for the general
benefit of the field, Trevor’s cash is being
used to crosscut east, so that rises may go
up there between the vertical reefs in
search of fresh flat makes. The best stone
being broken comes from above No. 6 level
and from the extension of the old shoot
worked there. That there isn’t much of it
is proved by the mine being put on a one-
shift basis.

Mt. Lyell knew enough about the Her-
cules-Rosebery mines to exercise its option;
but it wants to know more and has put a
drill to work to see if it can dig into some-
thing beyond the 800,000 tons of ore that its
officials have already reported on.

The boom gave New Rubv Flat (Tas.) a
profit last half-year of £lOBO from £2340
worth of tin. The shareholders got it all
in a couple of sixpenny divs. which (with
taxes, £00) called for £1279. On May 31
liquid assets were valued at £950, mostly
tin in the races, and the co. owed £326.
Water is available for sluicing three shifts
during this season; and there is enough
good ground ahead to make the little Mel-
bourne co. feel happy.

The Gladstone (Tas.) tin district is
looking up. A lode has been located handy
to the township from which cne man. work-
insr singlehanded, is knocking out £23 per
week. Of course, he is only Specking it, but
it is said there is a big mass of. tin-bearing
rock, and the Pioneer Co. may take a bite to
see what it tastes like. Some of the alluvial
shows are doing well in a small way, and the
Government has been advised by the mining
officials to see what can be done to develop
the field.
There is some talk of a gold discovery in
the Port Cygnet (Tas.) district. Thirty
years or more ago a fair bit of alluvial
gold was got about Port Cygnet. Some
estimates put the quantity at 20,0000 z. or
more, but it probably grew in the telling;
the official record says the yield was 3000 oz.
or so. Though it has often been looked for
there is only one undoubted instance of
gold having been found in the bedrock.
The directors of the Magnet silver lead
mine in Tasmania have done the square
thing, and paid a bonus of £5 per man to
miners and mill hands who, accepted reduced
wages when the metal markets went to
pieces at the outbreak of war.
* * * *
There is a slight revival at Gympie,
because several mines on the Columbia line
show improved prospects. The S. Glanmire
and Monkland is also attracting attention
again, on the strength of a formation carry-
ing small leaders north of the Power reef.
No. 2 Columbia has been raising specimen
stone from below 14G8ft.; and the reef is
from Gin. to 9in. wide, carrying free gold.
No. 3 Columbia is raising payable stone,
but dividends are postponed while sinking
and other development work is progressing.
The North Smithfield and No. 2 N. Colum-
bia are popular because they promise a
few good crusliings.
The Oaks (N.Q.) is bucked up by the
discovery of a Gin. leader at 321 ft. from the
mouth of the tunnel. A crushing of 700
tons was cleaned up in June for 91 oz. gold.
Working costs were 6s. 4d. per ton, but
wages men have been out on strike, and the
tonnage handled is small if the Oaks is
aiming at a dividend from material that
is giving a mine profit of only 2s. to 3s.
per ton, out of which management, deprecia-
tion, etc., have to be provided for.
Blair Athol, near Clermont (Q.), raised
5956 tons of coal in May. The Newcastle
raised 2191 tons, and the Co-operative 2269
tons. Although the output from the three
mines is still small, the coal is better appre-
ciated every year, and the demand is steadily
increasing. Blair Athol paid a sixpenny
in June; its profit is a shade over 2s. per
ton.
* * * *
Lode Hill (N.Q.) is wearing a more
cheerful look than it has for some time.
Last clean up of 13 tons was finished in
the middle of May, and the ground is open-
ing out in width as Lode Hill proper is
approached. Two faces are now being
worked, and the next clean up, due about
the third week in July, should leave a sub-
stantial profit.

“Platman” (from the neighborhood of
Cape York) : John Dickie, discoverer of the
Alice and Ebagoolah goldfields, is again
on the. Peninsula, the Government having
fitted him out with horses, etc. Word comes
that he has struck some likely-looking
country outside the Laura. The Peninsula
badly wants the. lift that a new discovery
would give, as it is rapidly becoming de-
populated .... The Palmer Gold Mines struck
trouble with the made-in-Germany engine
bought by the Government experts. Fuel
costs are ruinous. Oil costs £8 per ton
carriage from Laura to Maytown mines.
It would be interesting to know why the
State Mining Engineer and Inspector of
Mines were so keen on the oil-burning Ger-
man when there are plenty of good British-
built suction gas plants to be procured in
Australia.
“Copper-gouger”: The chairman of Mt.
Cuthbert (Q.) told his shareholders that
the co. produced 483 tons copper worth
£48,551, and that smelting, refining, etc.,
ran away with £31,746. Was anybody look-
ing when it went? It must have been the
most expensive bit of smelting this old globe
ever witnessed since the days of Tubal Cain.
Surely shareholders are entitled to know
how the £65-odd per ton is made up.
Just before the last mail left London Lake
View Oroyas hardened Gd. (to 10s.) and
London Australians 41d. (to Is. lOid.) on
the strength of a further rise in Burmas.
Lake View holds 100.000 of this stock, and
the London Australians £28,300 worth of
its debentures. London Australian also
holds, or had at the time its last list of
assets was published, 1800 shares in the Sons
of Gwalia, which were recently enhanced on
account of increased ore reserves. Speaking
at the Gwalia annual meeting in London
last month, chairman Barry said that for
the first time in the history of the mine the
ore in sight was fully four years ahead of
f.'f. Besides this they had between
6(X),000 and 700,000 tons of tailings which
were estimated to average Bs. a ton, and
yield a net profit of £50,000 to £60,000.

Bullfinch_Prop. (W.A.) dug out £99,871
during 1910, and sundry small receipts
brought the total revenue for the year up
to £100,040. Two Gd. dividends were paid,
and after allowing for depreciation a shade
under £7484 was left to carry forward
Average working costs were 15s. 7d., or a
reduction of over Gfd. compared with the
1914 figures; and extraction was a little
over 90 as against 93f. Lower extraction
is attributed to an increasing quantity of
sulphide ore being milled. At the end of
1915 the co.. had cash £9157; bullion in
transit, not including reserve, £4816; and
stores, £7036; but against these was £8282
owed to sundry creditors. Ore reserves are
estimated at 97,334 tons, assaying 255. sd.
per ton. The two Doolettes and Dick
Hamilton, of Great Boulder, are still on the
Board.
* * * *
Leonora (W.A.) has livened up as a
result of the Gold Blocks and Chaffers
deals, and is now trying to dispose of the
Harbor Lights. The latter has a big lode
from which several thousand tons have been
taken and treated for a small profit by local
people, but its prospects are nothing to
blow about. Several option holders, includ-
ing the Associated Northern, have tested the
show from time to time, but without any
business resulting. Sons of Gwalia knows
ot' its existence, but prefers to send out pro-
specting parties to Laverton and beyond
rather than take it on. Attempts will pro-
bably be made to palm off several Leonora
shows in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney,
but long working options should be insisted
on and no deal completed without them.
The tombstone for Black Range, Sand-
stone (W.A.), is now being carved by the
faithful Couper. For 14 years the show fed
the squatters of the Vic. Western District,
who, led by Ilans Irvine, forked out the
£20,000 required to buy and equip the claim.
Altogether £240,000 of divs. were paid from
£905,000 gold won; £96,000 went in develop-
ment and £60,000 for plant. The other half-
million went to the worker and the tax-col-
lector. The mantle of the old show is to fall
on the Binnacles, where Couper lias been
knocking things into shape. From No. 2 and
No. 3 shafts he is testing the ground at
under 100 ft. Ilis tally at the first-named
shaft is 13dwt. ore, but at No. 2 only poor
dirt is in the face. As he has the 100 ft. level
opened up for 700 ft. he has plenty of room
to draw on any special lens if he' wants to
average up the grade of ore.
* * * *
The profit of Edna May for the half-year
was cut by taxation and depreciation to
£38,360, while divs. paid were £38,565. This
looks bad ; but comfort can be got from the
belief that capital expenditure on plant is
now about over. Of course, the shaft lias to
go down; still, if the water has been drained
by the pumps at 300 ft., there won’t be any
awkward stop in development. By taking in
all the ore at that level the reserves show up
better in quantity than they did six months
ago:—-
t —Oct., 1915.—, —April,
Reserves, Value, Reserves, Value,

Manager Williams may find that there is
growling over the inclusion of the whole of
the 300 ft. ore, as he has not proved it on all
sides; but experience at the mine justifies it.
The point that the bears will hang on is the
pitch of the shoot of ore north-east, as dis-
closed in the plan, and the low results so far
reported from the stone to the south-west of
the fault. On the ore reserves, valued at
£204,219, and with costs at 235. per ton,
there is £150,000 profit in sight. Then
00,000 tons of slimes are valued at 255. 6d.,
out of which Williams reports he is getting
the good extraction of 92 p.c. On such work
the dump is worth, say, £36,000 to the co.
If costs of treatment be 55., the net value
would be £28,000, or a total profit in sight
of £178,000 —roughly, £4 per share. This
has to be added to the £4 10s. already paid
by this bear-blistering freak of a mine, which
85,720 tons has won gold worth
£360,882 and paid £188,540 in divs.
* * * *
From a Bulletin man in the West:—
Edna May stocks have got Westralian dealers in a
tangle. Deeps has no ore reserves other than what
may be classed as “probable,” and even this is
only “probable” to the extent of *what may reason-
ably be expected from the development disclosed by
one diamond-drill core. The main shaft is officially
expected to strike the main Edna May reef at about
490 ft., and it is already down 450 ft. However, the
reef is more likely to be struck nearer 540 ft. than
490 ft., and if the shaft exposes the reef at any depth
over 500 ft., the development will be a good one from
the point of view not only of Deeps but of Edna
May also. Deeps cash reserves are about equal to
its ore reserves at present, but local director Tom
Duff intends coming to the rescue with a loan of
£2OOO from his hard-earned cash.
The Edna May Central new reef, which recently
sent the stock to £6, is rapidly finding its level:
Bdwt. per ton is about the value of the monthly out-
put, and nothing better is in sight except, perhaps,
slightly-improved yields for two or three months
obtained by an extra ore-chasing effort. The 225 ft.
level crosscut recently passed through a vein of
quartz which looks like the continuation of the new
reef. However, values were not pasted on the
office door on this occasion, and when Central makes
no announcement as to values it can be depended
that they are fairly low. The crosscut is being
continued in the hope of finding something further
on. This is good business, as one never knows when
lOoz. values may be met with in the Central. But
lOoz. yields have not shown up so far. Possibly
the balance is in a large bullion reserve.
Bears, timid bulls and poor devils forced to realise
through not being in a position 'to provide extra
“cover” have brought Edna Mays to about the £5
mark.

different yarn about the ICarridale
\, rhlS 0116 is from R - J - Sangster:
“N.F.P.” (B. 8/6/’l6) is wrong. The prospectors
did not work the liarridale to 180 ft. Being one of
them, I know. Neither did the reef split to threads,
but it is going down strong the same size as over-
head. Moreover it contains the same values. I also
know that the Karridale big reef has not been worked
below water-level; it contains values up to 60s per
ton.
»* ous . P ar * the business is that
N. 4.1. said lie ought to know what the
prospectors did, too.

Britain is now importing more than half
l t n„!£ pply of t'orcign lead from Australia-
tons were imported in May. of which
1 667 tons came from Australia. The exports
were 5834 tons, leaving only 7851 tons for
domestic consumption. Before the war
Spanish lead had the run of the English
market, while thousands of tons of Aus-
tralian lead concentrates were regularly
shipped to Belgian and German smelters.

Last year the four Ivanhoe directors
divided £2210 in remuneration, and as some
of those out in the cold thought the Board
was collaring too much, at the annual meet-
ing chairman Govett proceeded to justify
the expenditure by stating that the job was
considered one of the few prizes of the
“profession.” The six or seven members of
the now defunct Oroya-Brown Hill Board
used to divide about £5OOO a year; but that
was in the days when the mine was blooming
and Kalgoorlie was at its zenith.

Those who suffer from corns and hard skin
on the soles of the feet w‘ll find it a great
boon to apply a little Atla Resin to the corn,
which, when applied to the corn or hard skin,
and a little covering of cotton wool on the
the top to prevent it sticking to the stocking,
will remove the corn in a day or two. The
Atla Resin seems to act by getting thor-
oughly into complete contact with the corn,
and thus being able to penetrate it, and not
to act on the surface only. It is certainly
the latest cure for these troublesome and
painful structures, and. according to all re-
ports by those who have used it, one of the
best.* f-

WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, July 3, 1916.
My Dear Auini. —
Bearded, russet-cheeked men from the
hill-country and long, lean men from the
Western plains crowded around President
James Kidd at the Sheep Show opening.
Governor Strickland turned an attentive ear
to the president’s glad tidings of a big in-
crease in exhibits, then took the rostrum and
launched his reply. After which the woolly
dukes and duchesses were led forward, with
a loud accompaniment of “Baa-aa,” to have
their toilets finished. There was fierce
resistance on the part of the aristocrats,
who backed and butted before they were
hurled into the Presence. Pure merinos,
such as his Grace of Crumple Horns, were
then invested with the ribbons of their
order. Veteran Sam McCaughey. was the
winner of a couple of events in this section.
A few women picked their way round the
pens, and the knitters’ gleam was in their
eyes as they buried a glove in blanket-rolls
of fluff. Squatter Merriman, the tough old
Yass pioneer, was the proud owner of a
small herd of prize-winners. Frank Edols,
of Burrawang ; Fred McMaster, of Dalkeith ;
Bob Carter, of Narromine; and Pat Osborne
were keen competitors; and Clive Dangar,
now in France, was represented by a'
countess or two. And of course Anzac was
there —a gentleman-sheep with horns all
round his woolly whiskers. He came from
Gostwyck.
Button Day for the War Chest began in
the bleak wintry dawn. Lady scouts were
early on the path, and by nine o’clock Martin
Place was like a market garden, with a sale
of fancy goods to steady the rush for pump-
kins. Faces began to peer out of high Challis
House fastnesses, and John Lane Mullins
looked like a miniature of himself framed in
brown stone. As the sun made a wan ap-
pearance—later drowned by weepy skies- —
the Governor’s chaise drove up. An official
retinue then fell upon his Ex. and landed
him on a small dais, where a herd of con-
suls revolved round the Presence. 11. Y.
Braddon, veteran Tom Dibbs, Kelso King,
soldier Finn, E. P. Simpson and other War
Chest backers made an island com-
pletely surrounded by Boy Scouts. The But-
tons were declared well and truly open —this
by his Ex. after Mrs. Ted Antill (one of the
first women workers for the War Chest) had
pinned a special decoration —gold set with
pearls—in the vice-regal coat. The delegate
from the Railway and Tramway Association,
which had gallantly given £550 for a button,
then took delivery of the goods, bobbed his
head and withdrew.
The 7th Light Horse ladies had a dashing
style in aprons. Dark butcher’s blue, with
red slashings and the number 7 proudly
mounted on one side. Their stall, just under
the G.P.O. chimes, sold nearly everything
you can put a name to. The 13th Battalion
dames, with Mrs. Morrison (widow of the
major who fell in Gallipoli), Mrs. Louis
Henderson (mother of a 13th who’s now a
dashing captain in -, there you are), and
others who barrack for Colonel Burnaby’s
lot, took possession of a Moore-street stand.
The rain pelted down for a while at mid-
day. Some of the girls had come out in
dazzling white, and 2 o’clock saw them
limp. Still they stuck to the game. Late in
the afternoon every other male was smoking
a “two-fer” cigar, for which he had paid six-
pence. Through the smoke he loomed over a
ballast of buttons that sagged his coat lapels.
Eadith Walker sold her wares in Pitt-
street. The Old Gold and Silver dames —
safely housed in Her Majesty’s vestibule —-
got buyers for about £lOO worth of stuff.
Across the way a plump citizen auctioned
anything he could lay his hand on. A bird
o’ paradise—stiff in death —brought over £5
in a few minutes. Jim Osborne, one of the
comic reliefs of the day, helped to run up
the fancy price of a fat sheep. Light repartee
and cash floated around the Red Cross Book
Depot —till the beast was moved on.
A Button Day rout in the Australia Win-
ter Garden was one of the thrills of the
War Chest campaign. Soon after lunch a
well-dressed mob of women collected round
the doorway. Wedged into a dense mass in
the outer hall, the pressure of a few femi-
nine battering rams at the rear gradually
hurled weaker units right up against the
glass doors. Behind rattled the china
which vassals were setting for the cafe
chantant. A mild young man sitting at the
receipt of custom, and selling the 2s. 6d
tickets, was nearly wiped off the map. In-
stead of opening the doors, a loud voice
forced its way through the surging crowd
and bawled a command “to get back to the
vestibule.” Lovely woman indignantly
. refused to fight her way whence she had
come at so much damage to her appearance.
Deadlock lasted for a few palpitating
minutes. Then the glass gate swung open.
Had it done so half an hour before, a mass
of fashionable millinery would have been
much less bashed.
When the company recovered its breath
it sipped tea and munched forage while
Bantock auctioned socks knit by the fair
hands of Julius Knight. Amidst a wild
buzz of comment, I fancy they climbed to
£lO 10s. and were knocked down to Loud
Applause. Ethel Cadman, Minnie Love,
Derek Hudson and Bryce Carter obliged
with sundry items. Julius gave “The Por-
trait” —a telling recitation which was
Lewis Waller’s first, spoken word to a Syd-
ney audience. Staid women then refilled
their teacups, while sprightly damsels
added a whisky and soda to their prelimi-
nary cocktails.
Archgaiters Wright put on his best purple
velvet bonnet the other afternoon and
marched round the grounds of St. Andrew's
Cathedral. Choir boys, with that heavenly
expression which comes from a well-soaped
countenance and well-fed interior, swelled
the procession. Archdeacon Gunther, who
grows thinner (he has about 77 milestones
behind), joined the throng. The fuss was
the opening of “The Soldiers’ Welcome.”
Mrs. Wright was inspired with the idea
when she saw the Melbourne rest-house in
St. Paul’s grounds. C.J. Cullen wedged
his way through the crowd after the pre-
liminary grace before buns. The grace, by
the way, was too long, and included at least
one mile of hymn which even the choir boys
didn’t know.
Colonel Miller came from Liverpool to
lift up the latch. He did it with, a small
piece of gold and a speech of about 64 words.
Then the visitors surged into the building
and fell upon the viands. The haven is a
large, cheery place, with a debt of £750 and
fibro sides. As about £4OO is already in
hand, the clerics are not afraid of being
rushed to the bankruptcy court. Ex-head-
master Stacy AVaddy’s curly head, jambed
into the millinery of a chaplain A.1.F.,
was a half-inch taller than most of the
pates present.
National Council ladies, in sables, velvet
and motors, bowled down to Government
House to resume their discussion on Thrift
—for other people. Lady Edeline, with
Ruby Board at her elbow, sat at the small
judgment table. Ruth Beale got into the
running before the company began to yawn.
She considered the cash how it may grow
(if Billjim, the wretch, doesn’t blew it on
’baccy and long odds!) by the new six
o’clock pub-rule. This done, the stately
Mrs. Laura Luffman arose. After some
purring she gave Australian housewives a
hearty scratch for being “the most wasteful
I have ever seen, and I have seen many
countries.” After detailing her own grief
when a former minion threw away a liam-
bone (this must have been in the halcyon
days when Bogue gardened in
the good lady sat down. Other speakers
perambulated from loin chops to husbands.
When the end came, A.D.C. Firth, emerg-
ing from some secret hiding-place in the
lobby, handed round cakes to the Thrifty—
his last job with the Stricklands.
The girl under
the early-Victorian
bonnet is no
stranger to you.
She is Paul in e
Bindley, the
soprano who ap-
peared with Du-
fault on a previous
visit here. Pauline
is a Bendigo girl,
and her father
“found” Amy
Castles and taught
her. Her musical
Mecca after this
tour will be the
U.S.A., where she
hopes to get into
light opera.
Chief Justice Cullen is Acting-Governor
for the coming fortnight or so. There has
been a kind of bank-holiday feeling in the
Governors’ Union of late. So our Ex.
moves on to Broken Hill, with a mild spree
in S. Australia at the finish.
Premier Holman, a weary man after the
recent storms, takes three weeks off before
facing worse oue s. He starts for Fiji this
week and puts i n a short holiday as Gov-
ernor Sweet-Escott’s guest. Then home by
the end of j u i y to meet t he Caucus and soon
a f te rwards the country,

Sympathy from a wide circle of friends
S’ o / 38 out popular Mrs. I lomley, of Manly,
whose elder _ daughter, the wife of Dr.
Hatley, of Lithgow. passed away recently,
Heceased lady left two infant children—one
very young.
Artist Frances Hodgkins has been well
hung” in the Royal Academy and is otnei-
wise flourishing. But her art school a ► •
Ives, Cornwall, was broken up by
authorities’ verdict: “No sketching on
coast.” Frances hadn’t thought about 1
that way, and the dear old War Office
hadn’t thought about it either till
M.L. artist had been at work for some time.
So she packed up her color-box for an Eng-
lish interior —Eversham —after swallowing,
the broth and sympathy of her friends in a
bad bout of quinsy and rheumatism.
Another M.L. artist, who began here
under Dattilo Rubbo, is off to London. Sue
is the youthful Evelyn Chapman, who is
dragging her devoted parents to England
via Panama. They left Wellington by the
Remuera. Evelyn notifies that she is going
to divide her time between munition making
and art study. It sounds strenuous.
I send you a pic-
ture of a man who
seeks publicity just
as little as anyone
in Sydney. But I
believe he would
go through the city
in a Chidley cos-
tume if he knew it
would make the
Red Cross Informa-
tion Bureau, at
Dalton House, 115
Pitt-street, known
to everyone or in-
crease its effective-
ness. Just over 12
months ago, when
it became very diffi-
cult. sometimes for
mothers to get tid-
ings of tlieir boys, Longer Owen, Iv.C., sug-
gested to the Bar of Sydney that here was
work for them to do. Promptly an organisa-
tion was established, and it has been Danger
Owen’s special charge. The portrait is Ins.
The bureau is ‘‘for obtaining news of sick,
wounded and missing soldiers,” and its ser-
vices are gratuitous. All it asks, if the in-
quirer can pay for the cost of the cable, is
that he (or she) shall do that much.
The Alpine Club pulls on its skis this
week for a tussle at Kosciusko. Profits of
the outing go to one of the War Funds.
The hardy annuals barrister Pitt and his
mother and sister take in their party Bar-
bara Gordon. She’s the girl who often gets
there first when the lady ski-ers are tossing
the snow about. There will of course be
some khaki in the party this year. Colonel
Harrison and Captain Hopkinson, of Dun-
troon, will wear it.
Do you remember the fair-haired Ethel
Brookman, of Adelaide? She was here for
the polo a month or so before the Great
Blaze. Her wedding to Pat Kirkpatrick, of
the Indian Police, throws a light on the
duties of Gentleman Bobby in the Coral
Strand. Pat controls a district as large as
the English county of Surrey, with head-
quarters at Sukkur, and half a million in-
habitants. Six months’ crisp weather on
the hills braces up the European resident
and incites him to get out of Sukkur, which
is 126° in the shade, with a butterfly breeze
at night. Ethel has been touring with her
Bobby. They get about on horseback, with
camels grunting behind under the Adelaide
girl’s Saratogas.
The war god is a cruel jester. Last week
Justice Ferguson got a letter from his son,
Captain Arthur Gardere Ferguson, report-
ing “all well,” and his Honor started on his
job in the law-mill invigorated by the good
news. A few hours later came word that
the boy had been killed in action on .Tune
14. A couple of years ago the Judge, kind-
est of men and most devoted of fathers, lost
another son. He is left now with only the
youngest—and the deep sympathy of a circle
of friends who feel for him something more
than ordinary affection.
Of the Anson family, who struck their
roots in Maoriland for a time, Denis, you
remember, was drowned in a frolicsome
launch outing in the Upper Thames in 1914.
A gentleman named Count Benckendorff
was one of the party. Now Frances Anson,
a cousin of Denis, is engaged to the Rev.
William Temple, younger son of the late
Archbishop of Canterbury. He used to be
headmaster at Repton, but is now rector of
St. James’s, Piccadilly.
Manager Freddie Shipman’s smile was
about half a yard wide at the first Dufault
concert. The size of the audience did it. The
silvery tenor is the same great artist as of
old. with either a bigger volume of voice or
a better understanding of our Town Hall
acoustics. His first two numbers, a noble
rendering of Handel’s “Where’er You
Walk” and Sullivan’s setting of the Prodi-
gal Son’s “I Will Arise and Go to My
Father,” were geriis. Pauline Bindley, in a
frothy white muslin frock caught with satin
bows, is the surprise of the present season.
The Bendigo girl, whom we heard first in
the raw, so to speak, is improved almost
beyond recognition. The recent M.L. tour,
with Dufault as friendly censor, has put a
polish on the always-promising material. A
tendency to sing a shade flat on her top notes
is her chief menace. Florence Scapini, the
Italian-Maoriland girl, in azure-blue tucks, is
the youthful fiddler of the company. Harold
Whittle pegged away cheerfully as accom-
panist.
What’s all this? The ’Frisco Examiner
credits Melba with the following
It is the dream of my life to have a home here
(US) and a class of young women in San Fran-
cisco. I shall regard the girls as my precious
charges. I shall consider it a privilege to teach
them personally, and a sacred duty to advise them.
Our songbird —who is about to stay on the
shores of Double Bay with the Spencer
Bruntons —is then described as alluding in
perfervid terms to a “Melba Conservatory”
in Melbourne. The hothouse plants in her
native city, however, according to the ’Mur-
lean reporter, won’t have the gardener’s
chief attention. That, lie says, goes to the
Californian buds —possibly next year.
Meantime Melba has set to work to sing
and beg some motor-ambulances for Russia.
Surely Ivan has earned them.
The Piastro-Mirovitch musicians crossed
the Murray after a final matinee in the Town
Hall. Final, that is, till they return. In
reply to queries as to why these upstanding
Russians are not in the trenches, I’m told
they’ve been exempted by the Czar. I haven’t
yet been able to ask the Czar why he did it.
Mrs. Arthur Kelynack, after three months
of agonising illness, lias passed into peace.
She went through the long suffering in her
own home on Lane Cove River. A devoted
family hovered round till the end. She was
the wife of barrister Kelynack, the big,
jovial man who looks like a wool-king in a
prosperous season.
In getting married at St. Stephen’s kirk
Mary Chisholm Ross did just what mother
did. And, moreover, all the Chisholm Ross
bairns as they came along, were christened
in the same Scotclibyterian stronghold. Bride
Mary’s finery, the most striking thing in the
loveliest of the June orange-blossom fetes,
was made by clever mother and a sister. The
trousseau was a dream in dawn-pink crepe
de chine. Every stitch was a labor of love.
Frank Coffee leaves by the Makura this
week for Vancouver. As it is somewhere,
about his thirtieth trip across, lie ought to
be able to navigate the vessel.
Dorothy Tange, a daughter of lawyer
Charles Tange, was wed in St. Peter’s, Neu-
tral Bay, the other afternoon. The ’groom
is Alfred, son of Brisbane bank manager J.
M. Davidson. The affair was very quiet,
just relatives to see the cake cut at Auntie
Moir’s, close at hand. Sister Thelma walked
behind, with Dr. R idler second-best man.
Tom, a son of the late solicitor Charley
Bull, of Sydney, has been promised that he
may call for Rosalie Henderson, a Kogarali
girl, and take her away for life.
Parson Wentworth Shields tied the knot
when Margaret, the fair-haired daughter of
the Hector Ross home at Croydon, married
George E. Cole, a Strntlifield man. The
bride floated up the aisle in White plumage
decked with Brussels lace. Above the tulle-
swathed corsage gleamed a necklet of pearls,
the bridegroom’s gift to the Peg o’ his heart.
Elsie and Lalla Ross were bridesmaidens in
foamy white. Dr. Phil Daniels supported
the ’groom. Reception at the Carlton,
where a sit-down banquet warmed the
toasts.
The 30th Battalion dames have wiped away
their tears, and are now looking for a new
address. Their bales of comforts blazed
away in a big fire at Winn’s in Oxford-street.
Hard luck, and I doubt if there’s a pen’orth-
of insurance over the depot’s £2OO.
George Lambert shows a portrait of Mrs.
Will Dyson at this year’s International
Society’s muster. As you know, she’s
Ruby Lindsay, Norman’s artistic sister.
J. C. Ives, a tall young man who for-
merly looked after the Lone Hand’s busi-
ness side, and now sits on a Bulletin stool
pursuing a similar line of thought, was wed
at St. James’s the other day. His best girl
is Bertie Norman, of Neutral Bay. She is
related to the Berkley who owns Newcastle
Herald.
The winter is unusually furry. The big
musquash coat, with a lady inside, has been
a prevailing feature of the season’s after-
noon gatherings. Somebody has a _few
coppers left, for the pelt runs into £25 or
so.
The Arts and Grafters hold their shew in
Norwich Chambers from July 3 to 7.
The 2nd D.A.C. comforts fund commit-
tee sends up a cry for helpers. 117 Pitt-
street is the address.
For some time the women’s war-census
bureau has been housed in the old building
that shelters the Amelioration Committee.
Like Jo, it has now been asked to move on.
But that doesn’t matter. It has been a
frost.
Yours affectionately.
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, July 3, 1916.
My Dear Yarrie, —
St. Vincent’s Hospital carnival, which
concluded with a pageant of “queens”
at Melbourne Exhibition on Saturday
night, was no great draw for the many-
lieaded general public. The management
struck bad weather; but in any case it
committed a grave error by disqualifying
the ready shilling at the turnstiles of a
building which has an unlimited holding
capacity. As it turned out, the show didn’t
deserve a big crowd. The stage-management
was extremely amateurish. The pageant
and the rest of the carnival should have
been presented on one stage; tlien a booked
seat would have provided a view of the
entire proceedings. Actually the show was
split into two sections —singing one end <>f
the building, pageant the other —and the
results were chaotic. Mrs. John Mills, the
Gippsland winner, polled nearly 300,000
votes, and beat Mrs. Healy, the bookies’
nomination, by £5O. Several queens were
scratched, and most of those who went to
the barrier looked unhappy. The right
regal touch was given only by dainty Irma
Caron, who bowed with educated grace,
looked pleased and greeted the audience with
benign smiles, just as though she were get-
ting paid for her trouble, like an ordinary
professional queen in unreal royal life.
Mrs. Jack Mills, “Queen” of Gippsland,
comes from the Maealister country, where
the cow is holy and money grows around
every bush. For public view the lady wears
a Marcel-waved Queen Alexandra bang, a
bold eyebrow, a hearty manner, ldoz. large
diamonds, 3doz. small do. and a bright and
shining smile. She is the type of matron
who can read the day’s book o’ th races
from cover to cover at one sitting without
getting bored.
The most gruesome part of the proceed-
ings was when the defeated Empresses were
rounded up by Chamberlain Bibron to kneel
before the throne and pay their moral rates
and taxes.
Dorothy Low, the Angel of the Corona-
tion, did not float down from the dome, as
was first intended. Brother Dave looked at
the celestial ropes and tackle, gazed up at
the dome, and decided to censor the flying
act. So Dorothy did her part with her heels
planted firmly on the red baize platform.
The battle between the St. _ Vincent’s
Queens was keen enough; but it was _ a
deaconesses’ tea-party by comparison with
the action between the A.D.C.’s. Each
queen had an attendant secretary to super-
vise the beating-up of votes, and the secre-
tary of the winning royalty was promised a
handsome bonus. The idea made business
lively—just as throwing one joint into a
den of hungry lionesses would wake up a
zoo.
John Madden had something to say to
daughter Lesley after the big Queen rally
at Cliveden. Some of the card maniacs
were so dead-sure that the Madden flat was
one of the havens for play that they tried
to raid the place after John had retired to
bed. If they had been unlucky enough to
succeed John would have committed them
all for contempt of court.
The Grand National at Flemington on
Saturday drew a huge crowd. Fine weather
had been ordered, so rain fell in icy tor-
rents. Balsillie, the cloud-coaxer, was
present, wrapped in a huge grey over-
coat, and walked the soppy lawn
wearing a mysterious smile. Women
were buried to their noses in furs.
The new coat collar, which turns up to the
ears, and the fashionable hat, which comes
down to the eyes, make a complete disguise;
so I am still wondering who was the ultra-
fashionable woman dressed in bright blue
tailorings, with a foot-wide border of the
sensational civet-cat fur, with a hat and
collar of the same sort.
Mrs. Harry Kirby showed a skirt hem of
cold-grey silk ruchings over pale-grey spats;
her coat was a real sable heavyweight. Mrs.
Machonochie, down from her northern sheep
corner, supported rare pink-brown foxskins.
Mrs. Thompson (Albury) got a lot of com-
fort out of the ermine swathed round her
comely shoulders. A gross or so of Manifolds
came along from Camperdown, and two of the
girls did a dress duet in blues. The
Madden-McEvoy sister looked comfy in squir-
rels. John Mills from Gippsland was there,
but his wife was at home getting ready to be
Queen in the evening. One of the Geelong
Bussells aired a new crinoline effect, with
a flare of bright chocolate-brown skirts
heavily braided. Mrs. Bogers Thompson
wore part of the grey wolf her husband shot.
And one young squattress simply had to wear
her new pink spring hat, in spite of the
dreadful weather. It looked as pathetic as

“Bigoletto” on Saturday night filled the
Princess’s, and the enthusiasts who hadn’t
booked in time had to stand. Mrs. Hugh
Ward, from Sydney, was in a box and some
noticeable clothes. Dolores, demure and
dimpled, partied in the dress-circle with the
Holroyds. Manager Gonsalez, all smiles,
bows and shirtfront, kept station as usual
just inside the stalls door. The whole com-
pany (including the dejected chorus) are
now wearing new clothes. It sort of lights
up the show.
Young tenor J.ois as the Duke in “Iligo-
letto” was too beautiful for the feminine
audience to merely listen to. lie wore
turquoise-blue velvet slashed with silver
and white, and his wonderful legs were
revealed in white fleshings. That was in
the Court scene. lie made love later iu
black velvet and gold. A still later love
affair was sung in purple silk, high white
riding boots with spurs and a dashingly
villainous cloak of dull black. Manager
Gonsalez’s daughter Gilda looked young and
fair in pink.
From our cousin in sodden Adelaide: —
Those of us who aren’t washed out of house and
home or reduced to a condition of sniffling misery by
colds derive what comfort we can from the fact that
we’ve established a new weather record. Ever stood
on a cold poultice under the shower-bath ? Tatter-
sail’s races were like that. The Railways Standing
Committee was submerged between Hergott Springs
and the Queensland border; it turned up at Lvnd-
hurst Siding five days after it was due at Leigh’s
Creek, having abandoned its personal luggage and
tents and walked miles. The Sturt Creek flooded
Morphettville, and various suburbs were more or less
submerged. And now councils are wondering where
the money is to come from to mend the roads. But
we shall be able to have a bath next summer.

Marking a Pause.
The G milestones are deserting us for N. S. Wales,
where they have taken a house at Gladesville. You
know them —the Canon used to cane our big brother
at St. Peter’s College.
Mrs. T. Hope Murray has had news of the death
of her son Kenneth, who had a commission in the
Seaforth Highlanders.
The Government has increased the grant for the
Glenelg breakwater from £32,000 to £llO,OOO -
three years to be allowed for the additional work.
The extended design will make the undertaking a
“reproductive work” by giving largely-increased
shelter for coastal boats. Meanwhile Glenelg remains
calm till it sees the finished article.
The Poona, with the Sturt statue on board, is due
here this month, and a tender for the erection of a
pedestal has been accepted. The P. and O. Co. has
announced its intention of sending in no bill for
freight.
Amongst the six “drunk and disorderlies” at the
police court after the week-end were two country
J’s.P., who were spared the “ignominy” of the dock
and given a private hearing in the magistrates’ room,
Premier Vaughan is going to ask why.
Bindley Webb, Associate to Judge Gordon, is to go
into camp shortly.
Amongst the last batch of wills lodged for pro-
bate was one bequeathing a pet dog to a. friend and
£2O for the animal’s upkeep. As a “stranger in
blood” the dog pays probate, and £2 of the £2O
goes' to the Treasury.
An amusement tax, on lines adopted in England,
shows its beak through the shell. A halfpenny on
each picture-show ticket —and thence upwards.
Mrs. W. D. Scott had her 91st birthday at the
beginning of the week. Her work as a flower-painter
is well known, and she still indulges her hobby.
The Military Command in South Aus. has been
bobbing about in a curious way. When the war
began Irving had it, but a year ago got his chance
to go to Egypt. Sandford, of Victoria, was sent
over, but in April he returned to his fortifications
business. Darvall, of the General Staff, became
Commandant for a few weeks, then made way for
Col. “Jim” Rowell, the only local man of the lot.
Now Irving, back from Egypt, takes charge again.
Rowell has had command of a transport, but is a
shade old for service in this war. His son was one
of the original batch of cadets at Duntroon, and his
nephew, Col. Frank Rowell, died at Gallipo .

was young, but withdrew for a time out ot

and he went into camp lorthwitu.
Pianist St. Leger has enlisted and will go

The best hostesses, who have done little
since the war, think they see a good excuse
for dinner-parties in the presence of Judge
Beachcroft and his wife, who have steamed
down from India on a visit to the vice-regal
Fergusons. “Of course,” trilled one matron,
“I wouldn’t dream of entertaining m these
sad times, only I feel it a sacred duty to be
hospitable to overseas visitors. bo tne
sacred duty will be done —with a knife a
fork.
Mrs Ted Dyson, Mrs. Russell Jackson
and David Low’s sister Dorothea organised
a cabaret concert at the Austral Salon on
Friday evening in aid of St. Vincents Hos-
pital. It was a lively gathering. Defence
Minister Pearce and Navy Minister Jensen
were present and supplied moderately-con-
vincing impersonations of Great Statesmen
in their More Frivolous Moments. Sketches
by Low, Esther Paterson, Nuttall and others
were auctioned by Dug Hart, and the names
and intentions of the various performers
were announced in delicately-modulated
accents by Edward Dyson.
The busy Crevelli dame is to open a

The wretchedly-named Melbourne Ragged
Boys’ Homes are feeling more ragged than
usual, and a demonstration and concert
with a 17-inch collar is due in the Town
Hall on Thursday. Mabel Mattingley is in
charge of the music, and there will be
movies.
Bert Bailey came to town to see the new
Steele Rudd play launched, and then retired
again to the bush to think it over. bydne\,
however, will see him enwliiskered and in
action when the Rudd piece gets across
there.
From “Rosna” in London: —
Australia and the army continue to keep their
friends busy nibbling wedding-cake. One of the
pretty Wesley Hall girls, of Melbourne —her whole
name is Florence Mildred Georgina Canning has
announced that she will try to make a better man
of Capt. Charles Edward Dunscomb Bridge, of the
Artillery, lie is a son of a brigadier-general, who
dwells at Reading when the Hun is eating sausages
at home. The Wesley Halls, you remember, are
Mt. Morganaires.
The Kilmany Park Pearsons’ younger daughter
Laura was married at Holy Trinity, Brompton, to
Capt. Claude Stewart Jackson, of the Coldstream
Guards, who dashed over from France on purpose.
On this occasion, too, there was a brigadier-general
with a D.S.O. and half the alphabet to sign the
register. He was the benedict’s brother and best
man, while the other Pearson maid, Helen, upheld
her sister. Some of the Pearson money also came
out of a mine—at Walhalla.
I may further be permitted to mention that Capt.
L. C. Pitman, of the Royal Engineers, who is a son
of H. H. Pitman, of Christchurch, has an appoint-
ment at the church with Mrs. K. F. Meiklejohn, a
Scottish lassie and widow of a lieut. in the Queen’s
Own Cameron Highlanders. Maoriland transfers
already signed and sealed are those of Dr. Cyril J. A.
Griffin, who is with the Army Medical Corps, and is
a son of the clerical Griffins of Auckland, to Jessie
Elizabeth Pinn, a S’African damsel; and Archibald
Kerr Arthur-W orsop, of Wanganui, who is with the
M.L. Medical Corps, to Margaret Leigh-Lye, daughter
of a Somerset' parson.
Melba’s appeal for Australian Field Ambu-
lances for Russia will be a big
judging by the enthusiasm at the first.meet
ing. Like a good business general she has
chosen the psychological moment to raise hei
cry. . ,
The latest addition to the luxuries or
Coombe Cottage is a large swimming-bath,
built in the open air on Grecian lines. it is
of marble, and has a blue lining which
matches the Lilydale sky.
On the Russians’ first appearance at the
Auditorium on Saturday night Melbourne
saved its musical reputation again by turn-
ing up in tramloads —not a bad performance,
considering the other shows available. -
the Auditors took kindly to pianist Mirovitch,
but found Michael Paistro of the fiddle some-
what cold, though superbly correct.
It seems a sensible thing to forward Miss
Niau with the latest batch of Australian
nurses for the French lighting zone, fehe
teaches French in the Newcastle High
School, and will pour irregular verbs into
our Nightingales’ ears on the voyage. This
will avert the tragedy of our capable women
failing to understand the delightful compli-
ments of Francois. He, poor fellow, will
certainly do his best, even when bandaged
out of recognition.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Ses”: “Minding bandicoots” is one of
the most dismal tasks on earth, and shooting them on
a moonless night the most precarious, there being
seldom anything more tangible than the thuds of the
retreating animal to aim at. The long-snouted crea-
ture departs with such emphatic thumps as to give
the impression that it hops like a kangaroo, whereas
it runs, or trots. In scrub lands, where logs and
stumps at first preclude the use of the plough, the
farmer endeavors to dodge the mischievous marsupial
by covering the track of his hoe. A long, narrow-
bladed implement is used, which, after being driven
into the ground, is prized back a little to enable the
worker to drop in his seed. Then the soil is pressed
back into its place. But “Boo” has good eyes and a
keen sense of smell. He does not wander about
prospecting here and there, but follows the row and
empties the holes as they come. In ploughed ground,
however, he does a lot of mining for little pay, for
there is no “lead,” nothing to indicate where the
“pockets” are. Some planters tar the grain, which,
though not eaten, is still scratched up; others set
traps along the alignment. The trap is carefully
buried, and a few giains of corn are sprinkled over
the spot; or it is set as for rabbits and baited with
peas, apple or carrot.
“X.Y.”: “Spreader” was lately puzzled by
Johnson grass, which at some stage or other in its
growth he had found mysteriously poisonous.
Towards maturity the starch cells become converted
into sugar; but "before this stage is reached the
starch is readily broken up into carbonic-acid gas.
If eaten at this time the green feed undergoes an
abnormally rapid decomposition and the gas causes
pressure on the vital organs, especially on the heart
and lungs, causing death quickly. It has been
noticed that when horses ate the young shoots of
Johnson grass (it starts early in the spring) they
became salivated to an extent that was simply mar-
vellous, the water falling from their mouths in half-
pints. The sale of the seed of this pest should render
the trader liable to severe punishment, as its intro-
duction renders the best alluvial soil almost worth-
less for farming purposes. The only use I can think
of for Johnson is suggested by the Germans. It
has been discovered that they have been importing
hundreds of tons of heather from Scotland to be
nitrated and used as an absorbent in the manufacture
of high explosives,: and the writer, with considerable
experience in that line, is prepared to back Johnson
grass, or even broom millet, against heather for this
purpose, at any time.
* * * *
“Barcoo”: Re the Haunted Hills (Vic.),
where it was recently alleged that cattle would
always rush when camped at night. Years ago when
large mobs of bullocks walked from Queensland into
Victoria there was one “haunted” spot that banged
all others. This was on the Old Man Plain, midway
across it, between Hay and Deniliquin (N.S.W.). The
cattle would all be nicely resting, when a grey pony,
known as “The Trotting Cob,” would tear up to the
mob at a great bat and go right through them. Then
there would be a scatter and 50 or 60 missing. At
daylight would arrive a handy mail-change man. He
was a wizard at finding lost bullocks—at a price.
This grey pony was by many superstitious stockmen
looked on as supernatural, but on the last occasion
he performed it was against a saltbush Bill who was
short of supersitions. He had a Winchester, though,
and that settled it.
* * * *
“A.A.8.”: Paragraphs have appeared in
recent issues declaring that eagles had been shot,
trapped or otherwise secured which have measured
Bft., 9ft. and upwards from tip to tip of wings.
Hr. Leach, of the Education Department, Victoria,
an eminent authority, author of the “Bird Book of
Australia,” asserts that there is no authentic record
of an eagle having shown a larger spread than 7ft.
If any of your contributors can supply him with
undoubted evidence that an eagle with a wing-spread
of Bft. or , over has been shot or otherwise obtained
he will be glad to have it.
“Devilfish”: “Hay” (B. l/6/’l6) may be
right in saying that there is only one species of
emu in Australia now. The Tasmanian variety of the
bird certainly differed from that common on the
mainland, being amongst other things smaller and
davker. They were exterminated with great enthusi-
asm in the early days, and were wiped clean out in
about 50 years. It is said that the emus found on
King Island, in Bass Straits, and also long since
extinct, were a third variety, differing from both the
Tasmanian and the mainland species, but no one
seems to know anything very definite about them.
“SEEING LIFE."
“E.T.L.”: It is 114 miles from Tocumwal
to Narandera (N.S.W.) and the train takes eight
hours to do it. I was one of the passengers and
was wondering why the department had compiled its
timetable on such stage-coach lines, when the cara-
van pulled up with a sigh, and the entire train
dismounted with fire buckets and boxes to harvest a
crop of mushrooms someone had sighted. The train
got to the next station on time by crowding on all
sail and dashing along at the rate of 10 miles per
week.
WAR ECONOMY-BREAD AND CHEESE AND KISSES.
“Billy T.”: I have been looking over a
poultry farm conducted by a man who professes to
know hens “in and out and all over.” He claims
that his output per fowl is superior to that of any
chicken-fancier in the business, not numerically, but
considered in bulk. He piloted me to the laying-in
department, and showed me how. His nests were
neatly arranged, and right in front of every laying
hen, staring her in the face, was a large, artificial
egg, about the dimensions of the ordinary product of
the emu. “Force of example,” said Blind. “It also
inspires the sportin’ spirit in a hen. She mightn’t
be able to do as well as that, but she has a try for
it.” Of course I laughed. Blind was hurt. He
pointed out the case of a notorious Scriptural sheep-
breeder as a historical precedent, and I was silenced.
It appears the notion is not merely the outcome of
Blind’s weird fancy; it has the support of the
managers of numerous large egg plants in France
and Italy, and results strengthen the opinion that
every hen should have an ideal.
* * *
“Warre”: “M.J.’s” lambmarking record
(B. 8/6/’l6) is nothing to ring the church bells
about. Remember a competition on a river station
nearly half a century ago when two “cutters” set
one another. Five catchers were allotted to each
man, who had to do his own tailing and earmarking
—the latter operation was done in those days with
the cutting knife, the top of the ear being sliced
off. As a further handicap, the scrotum wasn’t
then slit as now, but the top was removed. After an
eight-hour run the winner had put through 5850
lambs and the other bloque was a close second with
5520. Reckon either of those with the help of
earmarkers and tailers could put through 12,000 a
day.
# * # *
“Sarto”: What manner of man is “Nil”
to sneer at such names given to our wild
flowers as “cockatoo-claw,” “spiders,” “dog-
face,” “old-man’s-beard” (also called “billygoat’s
beard”), and the children who named them? Him
and his “day’s eye,” “heartease,” and “queen of the
meadow ’! The Australian “cockatoo-claw,” “spiders,”
“dogface,” “old-man’s beard” or “billygoat’s beard”
were so christened because they resemble those things.
The names show initiative and imagination, two
assets that go to make the best type of men and
women. On the other hand, whoever saw a flower
that looked like a “day’s eye” or a “heart’s ease’ ?
Nobody that wasn’t jimjammy. Such names give
one the impression that they are the result of a
halfpenny-paper competition. As for “Nil” being told
to mind his own business by the Minister for Educa-
tion to whom he suggested that committees should
be created to select names for Australian wild flowers,
I emphatically shout “Hooray.” I'll also shout for
the Minister if he can spare the time and the money.

seated Hans Topsell, the first paleface on the beach,
who married (without benefit of sky-pilot, white or
brown) the show girl of the kainga, and gave her
as his wedding-gift a pair of beautiful red boots.
That was more than 80 years ago, but the tribe
hasn’t forgotten Mrs. Hans Topsell’s first bootees,
which apparently she insisted on wearing all through
the honeymoon.

RAFFERTY’S PRAYER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Poor Rafferty was dead at last;
His trembling widow wept aghast,
And little, white-faced children stole
In sombre garb of dreadful dole,
While men with grave and kindly eyes
Spoke words of comfort good and wise.
A man whose every day and night
Had been a never-ending fight
With circumstance, the cruel blow
Of dark mischance had laid him low.
And all the golden dreams of peace,
Where weary vigilance shall cease,
And men with energy outworn
At least can sleep, though tired and torn,
For Rafferty had been in vain ;
He lived in strife and died in pain.
His was the daily life through which
All men must blunder, poor and rich;
Oft overtaken unaware
By debt or sickness and despair;
Dragging along through aching hours
Dumbly his half-exhausted powers ;
Laid low, when things began to mend,
By fate, by folly or a friend—•
One of a navvies’ gang, he drew
His cheques on life as monarchs do;
For life is but a painful game
Where, high or low, men do the same:
Fight for their rights, avenge their wrongs,
Are whipped with sticks and bound with thongs,
And face their sorrows with their songs.
A priest of solemn mouth was nigh
To watch the wasted navvy die.
“Mother of God,” so said the priest,
“This soul, from human pangs released,
Now through Thine intercession may
Rise to Heaven’s immortal day.
Pray then,” he murmured to the wife,
“For Rafferty’s eternal life;
Through day and night and night and day
Go down upon your knees and pray.”
And Widow Rafferty made moan
Upon her knees to reach the Throne,
And all her children knelt to plead
That by God’s grace the soul be freed.
Then the great heavy hand of God,
Which sometimes lays on men a rod
Of such intolerable woe
That only men could suffer so,
Or lifts them up from dreary pain
Making their spirits bold again—
The Hand went out through endless night
To that black place beyond man’s sight
Where the dead souls for evermore
Lie heaped, and ever millions pour;
And on the soul of Rafferty
God’s finger touched unerringly;
A Voice of awful thunder spoke:
“Awake!” And Rafferty awoke.
The Soul looked out with fearful eyes
On the illimitable skies ;
Immortally awake, it saw
The terrors of eternal law,
The ceaseless doom of life renewed
To uttermost infinitude;
Life with its woes, its fret, its pang....
And through the dismal waste there rang
A shriek, that swelled from sky to sky.
And still the echo would not die
’J ill on the throne of God’s command,
Where Mary and the Saviour stand,
It struck—and God withdrew his hand.
What said the navvy? What prayed he?
“Dear Gocl, for Christ’s sake, let me he!”

MILITARY BOOTS
The boot here _ illustrated is one you know well by sight—the
boot worn by members of the Expeditionary Forces. We are mak-
ing them in thousands to the order of the Government, who have
an inspector to examine and pass every pair before delivery is taken.
Some pairs, when finished, fail to pass him—not for any fault that
really affects their wear or comfort, but for such minute defects as
one boot being as little as one-eighth of an inch higher at the back
than the other; one slug being out of place; or the heel not being
sufficiently even to pass the spirit-level test.
Nothing else is wrong with the rejects.
They’re SOLID LEATHER THROUGHOUT,
are built to withstand the toughest usage, to
give the MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF COM-
FORT TO THE WEARER, and are GUAR-
ANTEED to do so.
WRITE NOW FOR A PAIR. They’re
ideal for country and other hard wear, and
for the money—l4/6, carriage paid—are
POSITIVELY THE GREATEST BOOT
VALUE EVER OFFERED.

“Daybreak”: “Phillip’-’ (B. 4/5/TG) is
wrong in several respects regarding the habits of
mutton-birds. F’rinstance, he says the parents after
having hatched the young ’uns clear out and leave
them to live on their own fat. Not so; the old
birds return every night, and their method of feed-
ing their progeny is this. Throughout the day the
old birds collect, and deposit in the stomach, fish,
carrion and any other suitable matter that is of a
fatty nature, and disgorge it down the necks of
the fledglings. Ma and the old man do not return at
the end of March to escort the young ones away ;
they are on the job the whole time, from spring to
autumn. The general mobilisation for departure
begins on April 27, when for three days there is a
strenuous time giving the youngsters preliminary
sprints on the wing preparatory to the final evacua-
tion on the 30th. On that day both old and young-
clear out, and the rookeries are deserted till the
spring comes round again. Where the birds go to
seems to be a mystery. No one knows for sure,
but some say Japan. “Phillip” wildly exaggerates
when he says the mutton-fowl's egg is. as big- as a
goose’s. ’Tis about the size of a duck’s, and some-
thing similar in taste. 1 know; I've sampled them.
The young birds when cooked unsalted make a very
tender and delicious bit of picking. While the catching
season is on men live on them alone for over six
weeks without a change of menu. Some doctors say
they are very beneficial as a diet for consumptives, and
the mutton-bird oil, which is better than the best
cod-liver juice, is prescribed for all ailments of the
lungs.

“Specco” : Skins may be tanned this way.
Cut off the useless parts; then soften the pelt ln-
soaking, so that all flesh and fat may be scraped
from the inside with a blunt knife. Soak in warm
water for an hour, and during that time mix equal
parts of borax, saltpetre and Glauber salts with
enough water to make a thin paste. About loz. of
each ingredient will give enough for an opossum
skin and proportionately more will be required for
larger pelts. When the hide has soaked in the warm
water lift it and spread it out flat, so that the paste
may be applied with a brush to the inside. Double
the skin together, flesh side inwards, and place it in
a cool place for 24 hours, at the end of which time
it should be washed clean and treated in the same
way as before with a mixture of loz. sodium car-
bonate (washing soda), -loz. borax and- 2oz. hard
white soap.

“Lou” : Ilore tire a few of the pet names
given by wieldcrs of the pick and banjo to the
ganger: “The red light,” “the big bloke,” ‘Hhe gun,”
“the nark,” “the spur,” “the shelter,” and “the
nit.” And here’s how they fling him their resigna-
tions: “Write mine out,” “Scratch me off,"’ “Gimme
a slip,” “Get out yer book,” “I’m snatchin’ me
time,” “Give us a leaf,” “Tally me,” “I've called for
the rent,” “Sign my brief.” Heard a ganger one day
as he wrote out the docket quietly ask “Why ?” The
bloke in the same quiet tone replied: “The call of
the uncorked.”
NO SENSE OF JUSTICE.
S.M.: “But don’t you think it would have saved you both a lot of trouble if you had
settled this case with the defendant out of court?”
PLAINTIFF: “That’s just what I wanted to do, your Worship, but the cow wouldn’t put up
’is ’ands.”
A PROBLEM.
INEBRIATED PERSON: "I's all very well for you to shay hang outer the fensh an' I’ll
be [?]; but how am I going to hang on to the hole in it?”
“►S.” : A correspondent of Adelaide Regis-
ter (13/6/’l6) declares that, having inadvertently
crushed two legs of a tarantula in capturing it, he
later watched the beast deliberately bite the two
useless members off. The lower forms of life often
shed their appendages; but deliberate amputation
seems anew thing.
“5.0.5.” : I’ve come to the conclusion
that, my old horse ought to have his life-line ex-
amined. I've owned him for 11 years, and he has
scratched 30,000 miles behind in that period, his
travels round the horizon before being caught and
his trips on ordinary camp messages not included.
How do I know the distance? Well, I’m an in-
specting surveyor, and my calling compels me to keep
an accurate diary. He’s won four blue ribbons and as
many reds in return for his performances at country
shows in the hunting, hack and best-all-round series,
and if he wasn’t a grey he could very nearly fetch
off a buggy-horse prize even now. He was entire
until four, and to a stranger is the worst ever to
catch. I got him for £l2.

“Tweed River”: If any bushman will read
me the riddle of the habitat and habits of the local
black cockatoo when nesting and rearing a family
I will say a prayer for the reprieve of his grand-
mother’s soul. I have questioned likely people from
the Burdekin to the Boga and am still without an
answer.
* * * *
"E.E.S.” : I pass the scientific moniker of
the vegetable; everybody outback is acquainted
with it as the Devil’s puff-box. If nothing else
will stop bleeding get hold of one (plenty of them
in Queensland and N. S. Wales), break it open and
apply the spongy side to the wound. I’ve seen it
turn the tap off when nothing else short of a medical
congress could do the job.
* * * *
“Hay” : When hungry for fruit the bush-
man samples all kinds of wild tack. I have even
tried to swallow a mouthful of the deceitful wild
orange. This one was green, and was about as
satisfactory as a mouthful of concentrated turpen-
tine. The tree, a pretty little thing, flourishes near
the north-west corner of N. S. Wales, and with its
bright, evergreen foliage is decidedly ornamental.
The wild cucumber, found in the north-east parts of
South Aus., is more satisfying. This is a pear-
shaped fruit, the product of a creeping vine of the
clematis kind. When young and tender it is juicy
and eatable, though rather tasteless. The plant is
also known as milk-bush, owing to a milky juice
exuding from the stems when broken. It is probably
a native cotton-bush, for when the pears or cucum-
bers ripen they burst open and expose a silky, white
fibre.

“D.F.”: Hobart has its queer pub-names

that have passed out are the Cat and Fiddle, the

“Hay”: There is a small annual plant of
the back country which springs up in large quanti-
ties whenever a good rain happens. It starts' as an
insignificant circular weed growing flat on the
ground; then a middle stalk clothed with long
notched leaves runs up to a height of about 18
inches. The spike bears a bunch of little white
flowers, followed by seeds a bit larger than rape
seed. The leaves of this plant are the hottest things
in the shape of green vegetables I have ever
sampled, and the flavor is hardly distinguishable
from the best brand of mustard. Binghi is very
fond of it. He calls it “ooticha,” a word which,
sounding like a sneeze, seems to properly describe
the powerful condiment. After a dry spell, when
the blaekfellow has been living entirely on meat
and a few permanent roots, anything green is in
great request, and as Soon as the ooticha appears
the gi ns bring it into camp in nets. I don’t know
whether the fiery plant would have any value com-
mercially, but I can say for myself that, as a
relish, it has often made an otherwise unappetising
meal very enjoyable.

A recent importation into the Speck is
the European currant borer, called for short Aegeria
tipuliformix. The hunt for the San .Tose scale in
Launceston has shown that the insect is going strong-
all over that city. The caterpillar gets into the
pith of the bushes and eats them right down to the
ground-level in a few years. The only, known remedy
seems to be to grub up the infested vegetables and
burn them.

“D.F.”: What will probably be Private
Adrian Evans'3 closest call came before he started
for the Front. He was standing on the road near
Wynyard, holding a horse by the bridle, when a
tree crashed over, knocked the horse out of his
hand, and made it the deadest beast in Tasmania.
Evans was thrown down, but got off with a few
bruise.5.
“Llib” : This is one thing that immigrants
who go on the land ought to know—the sensitive
plant. It has seized on hundreds of acres in the
Bloomfield district (Q.), and is making a name for
itself on the Daintree and around Cooktown. I find
some of it now in the Charters Towers district. It
carries a. small thorn, and you cannot coax horses
over a patch of it with a sapling.
NO LUCK.
THE OLD GENT. : “Why don’t you follow that
young man’s example?”
THE YOUNG P IRATE: “ Gripes, mister, me
lack’s dead out! I’ve been trying all the
afternoon to hook one.”
They’ve learned something new about the
hawk in Maoriland. lie’s a fisherman. For a long
time past he has been suspected of poaching trout,
but no definite charg-e could be brought against him
until recently, in the Canterbury district, one of the
family was seen to rise from a creek clinging to
something in his claws. A hundred feet or so in
space the bird dropped the cargo, which was picked
up on the roadside by two spectators. It was an
albino trout weighing a pound and a half.

From this paper’s old-established Mel-
bourne showman: —
The advent in Melbourne of another Italian opera
co. has set the old heads pondering over bygone
bunches of Italian names. Recollections dating back
to 30 years ago are mostly confused between Martin
Simonsen’s three companies. The first (1886),
which stayed nearly a year in Australia, included
Lazzarini and Ciuti, a tenor and soprano who had
starred in their time at Paris Grand Opera House.
Other principal women were Tagliavia (mezzo),
Alice Rebottaro (light soprano), and Cavalleri (con-
tralto), with Flo Graupner as an Australian extra.
Flo was a mere girl at the time, but she had to
paint wrinkles on her young face and play Martha
in “Faust.” The baritones were Pimazzoni and
Cerne; Buzzi and He Alba supplied the basso re-
quirements, and Santinelli was the other tenor. The
two bassos and Ilazon, the conductor, remained in
Australia when the rest of the co. went back to
Italy.
In 1888 old Simonsen made an unlucky venture
with a band of Spanish mandolin players and a
mixed English and Italian opera co. The foreigners
this time were Dimitresco and Lencioni (tenors),
Pimazzoni, once again as the baritone,
(basso), and Rosina Ajrno and Parmiggiana
(sopranos). A French contralto —Louise Lablache —
was specially imported for Carmen purposes, whilst
the principal women on the English side of the
organisation were Lilian Tree and Flo Graupner.
They appeared together in “The Rose of Castile.”
Simonsen had another try in 1891 with a co. which,
under a stronger financial management, would pro-
bably have been a winner. Or perhaps the bursting
of the land-boom had made it impossible to run
Italian opera at a profit just then. Cuttica was the
prima donna attraction in this case, Emilia Guidotti,
the other soprano, being put out of the running by
sickness. After which she made a happy marriage
in Melbourne. The tenors were Cuttica’s plump and
often mellifluous husband and Vilalta. The con-
traltos were Cavalleri once more and Castiglioni.
Melossi (great as Rigoletto) and Sisco attended to
the baritone duties, and Travaglini and lorio were
profoundly basso. The two Cuttieas—when the hus-
band was in good voice-—with lorio and Travaglini
were a mighty strong combination of voices; more-
over, the winsome little lady had a lot of dramatic
talent and was convincing in every part she took.
All recollections of Tancioni Cuttica are unanimous
in rating her as the most charming operatic artist
ever heard in this country; nevertheless Simonsen
went broke over the season, and the co., after filling
a Williamson engagement, had to give some popular-
price concerts before they left the country.
In 1893 a small Italian co. came along under
W. and M. management to introduce “Cavalleria,”
“Pagliacci” and “L’Ami Fritz” to Australia, with the
Blue Ballet as second half of the bill. Giraud,
Caruson, Frasca. and Roussel were the men, and
Italia Del Tarre the prima donna. Then, after a
lapse of 18 years, came the crowd engaged by George
Allan and Ilazon, who appeared at the Williamson
theatres. This was perhaps the strongest all round,
and certainly the most numerous, of the Italian
combinations. The ladies were Benedetto, De Vere
Sapio, Bassich, Vaccori, Marcomini and Marchi. The
men were Larizza, Dani, Cattadori, Cannonieri,
Bozzoli, Lombardi, Tondini, Salvarani, Savini and
Travaglini, the basso of 20 years earlier. The old
opera-goers who think back from 15 to 30 years
have all these Italian names about their brain, but
find it hard to place them in their respective periods.
The confusion is aggravated by the fact that three of
the names—Cavalleria (contralto), Pimazzoni (bari-
tone) and Travaglini—figured in two companies, but
not twice together.
“Circle”: There was a clanking sound as
if all the cows were coming home, and a
female grenadier covered in furs and with
about half a hundredweight of rattling silver
chatelaine in her fist steamed into a front
stall and dropped anchor. Her escort got
her a programme and a box of chocolates, and
as soon as she had gushed a little and filled
her mouth she started to jabber. Presently
she swung round to signal a woman friend,
and the silver gear slipped unnoticed off her
lap. The elderly and fascinated Billjim who
was occupying the next seat touched her
lightly on her gloved forearm and pointed at
the floor. “ ’Scuse me, missus,” lie said,
“you’ve dropped yer tools.”
“R. 8.”: George Black’s film censorship
scheme (N.S.W.) may not be good in its
constitution, but it’s wanted all right. I saw
this week a film, a rotten thing produced by
a diseased mind from the scenario of a
gorilla. The alleged plot turns on the theft
of a Judge’s children. The girl—at about
the age of 13, apparently—is to be handed
over to a filthy ruffian with a hook instead of
a right hand. The “big” scene is the struggle
of the girl to escape the lust of the ruffian
and of his son, ending with papa et fils killing
each other. No harm to grown-ups, because
the melodrama is so bad as to be farcical,
but children shouldn’t see such insults to
intelligence. The minds of many of these
great motion-picture producers need constant
douches of undiluted permanganate of potash.
Business, Bobbery, etc,
The despised rabbit is the juicy export
nowadays. In May last year 511,095 pairs
of bunny left Sydney for somewhere; in
May, 1916, the figures jumped to 1,661.226
pairs; and for 11 months the exports have
totalled 8,911,189 pairs. The demand for
the canned or frozen rabbit is so lively that
for the moment the cocky who mostly raves
at the curse allows trappers on his ground
for a “concession” and thanks Allah for the
blessing.

From a former Australian shipping man
now in his native Holland
Our shipping trade is paralysed. After the Tuban-
tia affair no company cared to send its ships out, and
several incoming Dutch steamers were detained
en route. The Nederland and Rotterdam Lloyd and
several other passenger lines have temporarily sus-
pended their mail services, so that we are practi-
cally cut off from our possessions in the East. Our
two Java mail services decided since the beginning
of this year to abandon the Suez route and send their
steamers via the Cape, entailing an additional voyage
of 12 days. Now even that service is stopped.
Moreover, all Dutch steamers, both inward and out-
ward, and even those trading with our own colonies,
are held up on the high seas by the Entente (if
they have not previously been torpedoed or mined by
the Germans) and conducted to British ports, where
not only their cargo but even their passengers and
mailbags are carefully examined. So, for instance,
I received the other day a letter from my Dutch
brother in Dutch Java posted by the Dutch mail
and marked “opened by (British) Censor.” There
is no redress ; we must just suffer and try to look
pleasant, even though we don't feel so.
The petition of Bahar Nalila Yousef to
his Excellency The Bulletin’s old friend
Brown: —-
■ God Save tub Kino.
To His Excellency Major Brown.
Respected Sir, —Your servant has the greatest
honor to inform you that 1 possess the piece of land
Where the crop, about which you were so kind to
write to the authorities, is found. Here 1 say that
f will offer from my own accord this piece of land
to be used by the military authorities as long as His
Majesty’s troops stay here, and this I do without
taking or looking for any damages or rent.
For this, anil also to prevent any trouble caused either
to us or to your men by foreign persons and men not
of our family, we beseech you to be so kind as to
give us the sole right for keeping the Kantine with
the rest of the members of our family. My son
Kamel is well acquainted with the English language,
and we will charge him with the work, so that there
will be no, misundestang between your men and
the villagers. We hope you will be so kind as to
hand over this request to the high authorities, men-
tioning - Kamel in the letter will get. With great
respect.
Yours very truly, I am, your obedient Servant,
BAHAR N All LA YOUSEF.
P.S. —This piece of land is about one acre, and is
used for the blankets and some few tents.
You remember, Sir, the case of the box which
was stolen by one of another village. Thus our whole
idea by doing this and offering our land is to prevent
any foreign person from coining here either in selling
and buying or for doing anything, in this case we
will be responsible for everything, and we will do
our best to facilitate everything for you.
Humbly I remain,
Your obedient Servant,
Yours very truly,
BAHAR NAIILA.

“Try Fluke” : Some of these days there’ll
be a bailing-up on the high seas that will
send the large, salt tears rolling down the
hard cheeks of the underwriters. Not long
ago the Moana took pretty well half a mil-
lion sterling in gold to California. In the
’Frisco papers of last mail I read that the
Java-Pacific liner Karimoea went out
through the Golden Gate a few weeks ago
with a minted cargo that Customs officials
described as the largest ever taken across the
Pacific. It totalled, British reckoning, nearly
£740,000. Most of it was in 20-dollar gold
pieces for Batavia, sent on account of
Amsterdam banks to maintain their credit
in Java. To a potential pirate like myself
it is painful to see all this good red gold
passing the front door to swell the coffers
of the fat banks and fatter Dutch merchants.
Who is on for a little cutting-out expedition,
in a rakish low steamer —Michael Scott
schooners areCout of date—with a brace of
wicked four-point-sevens and a masked crew
of gentlemen adventurers? I’ve a sweet
little isle of coral and cocoanuts in my mind
where the haul could be stowed and distri-
buted amongst us poor but honest men. And
there’s positively no danger : it could always
be blamed on to the Germans. I\S. —Besides,
think of the movie rights!

“Tiaki”: This is how it’s done. Henare
Haruru wanted a motor-car. He negotiated
with McFlint, the lessee of his share in the
Paikoko block, for a deposit of £75 on a.
prospective sale. Te teposhet secured the
car, and Henare commenced the consumption
of benzine on wholesale lines. Then news
came from the Native Land Board that it
would not sanction the sale, and the agent
pounced down on the car. The lessee, for
his part, is charging Henare a trifle of oyer
1000 per cent, for te teposhet and deducting
the same from te rent. 1 met Henare industri-

Hume Brothers, of Adelaide and Mel-
bourne, have an Australian invention for
making water-pipes out of cement, which is
going, they reckon, to revolutionise the
business. They started in Adelaide, and
when a big lot of sewerage pipes were
wanted in Melbourne they shoved in a
tender, thinking they might be given a bit of
the work to go on with. When they found
they had got the contract for the lot
they gasped twice and then started to put
up works in Melbourne in a hurry. Now
they have their first big job for water-
pipes, as distinct from sewer drains. The
llobart Council has given them a contract
for seven miles of line at about half the
£30,000 that steel pipes would have cost.
The Ilumes are going to start works on the
spot, partly because pipes may be wanted
by-and-b.ye for irrigating the midlands.

One of the queer sidelines of Business,
Bobbery, etc., was revealed in Sydney the
other day when an attempt was made to
secure a conviction for false pretences against
two men who had endeavored to sell falsely-
stamped jewellery. The business of one of
the men was to buy up old gold, turn it into
modern jewellery, and stamp it with a num-
ber. The other man was what is known as
“a galloper”; liis business was to run the
stuff around to pawnbrokers. The prosecu-
tion failed on the plea that no false repre-
sentation was made that the number —say,
.15 —indicated the carat. It transpired that,
apart from the Victorian hall-mark, the Aus-
tralian public is entirely unprotected against
falsely-stamped jewellery. The Common-
wealth insists that imported baubles be
correctly marked; but once past the Customs
anything may happen, so far as the Com-
monwealth is concerned. ' The Working
Jewellers’ Union has been barracking for
years for a proper gold-marking Act in N. S.
Wales, and when a man claims (as the chief
defendant in this case did) to have been
conducting his “business” for 20 years there
seems to be reasonable justification for the
disturbance.
* * * *
The case concerned a charge of pilfer-
ing cargo, described as the property of
the P. and O. S. N. Co.; but it had been
discharged from the ship at Port Jackson,
and was on its way to the consignees when
the theft occurred. The point, therefore,
arose, that there was no proof of ownership
in the P. and O. Co.; and, in conformity
with judgment in the case of Bloggs v.
Blithers, his Honor discharged the indict-
ment. Then the Law, in haste, drew up a
charge of theft and unlawful receipt of
articles, the property of some person or per-
sons unknown. As they were not the prop-
erty of the consignees, by whom they had not
yet been received, it seemed the only way
out; but it is understood that Costs is wad-
ing through all the muddled library of Prece-
dent to see how much the business can be
further profitably tangled.
Eric Wright, of Southport (Tas.), sees
money in kelp, and has got some of it out.
With very primitive appliances he has
already gathered and burnt enough of it to
produce between 20 and 30 tons of ash, assay-
ing 32 per cent, of potash. Before the war,
when all Australia’s potash came from Ger-
many, this would have been worth £9 per ton,
but prices have soared since then. As Aus-
tralia used to import an annual 5000 tons,
there ought to be room for a whole lot of
kelp-burning, and there’s no chance of
exhausting the raw material.
THE HAPPY TRAMP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I see him there across the street;
He sits against the wall,
A raffish, frowsy, friendless beat,
With broken boots upon his feet,
He wears no shirt at all.
He ducks the barber and his ills ;
He’s fretted with no laundry bills.
And though he has not washed to-day
He never will repine ;
He lets the morning drift away,
And scorns the need of making hay
Howe’er the sun may shine;
An outcast thoroughly content,
Who’s never called on for the rent.
With borrowed match he lights the fag
He found upon the pave;
With nothing but a battered swag
And broken victuals in a bag
He has no call to save ;
He sits and grins at all the fates,
A wretch exempt from water rates.
He sniggers at the busy bees
In quest of many crafts;
Why should a free man envy these
Their income tax, and dentist fees,
And little overdrafts ?
One can be happy, he has found,
Who doesn’t owe a single pound.
He feels he lives the life complete,
Of gas-collectors rid,
And owing no account for meat,
And though he has no friends to bleat
For loans of half a quid.
He teaches us, this vagrant stout,
How much a man can do without!
VICTORIA.

LOVE'S LABOR LOST:
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A letter posted in Mildura in 1913 was delivered
in Melbourne last week.
. I sent a note to my ensnarer,
Saying I’d loved her all my life,
That none to me was dearer, fairer,
So would she be my wife?
Impatient, her reply I waited,
But weeks passed and it never came;
I cursed each rhyming fool who’d prated
Of Love’s enduring flame!
I left sweet honle and sought to borrow
Surcease from pain in sundry ways;
I quickly overcame my sorrow,
And laughter filled my days.
I’d quite forgotten that I’d met her,
For ’twas three years ago I wrote;
And then to-day I got a letter
In answer to my note 1
She was, she said, extremely flattered,
Although my note had missed the ’bus;
’Twas awf’ly sweet to think one mattered.
And then she went on thus:
“But, dear old thing, we cannot marry,
My husband is so strict, you know.
Our Number Two—we’ve named it Harry—
Was born three weeks ago!”
While reading I had grown quite nervous;
Relief, though, quickly banished dread.
God bless the Postal (lack of) Service,
For I am still unwed!
VICTORIA.
HARRISON 0.
THE DIVIDED CRITIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I entertain a vast contempt
For things that suit the crowd
In plots by crudest bunglers dreamt.
It pleases me to be exempt
From joy when long and loud
The foolish populace applauds
These shallow old dramatic frauds.
Yet here I make confession fair:
My mind with scoftings wild
May mark the actress tearing hair
And hear her voicing her despair
When driven from her child ;
Yet in my weaker flesh appears
A wretched tendency to tears.
When Jane is cast into the snow,
And callous father cries:
“You have disgraced me old age. Go!”
My splendid brain derides the show,
But water floods my eyes.
This contradiction gives me pain—•
I’m half afraid to go again.
“To my mind” (so I write) “this play
Is most prepost’rous tripe!”
In honesty I ought to say:
“My liver fluttered in its sway,
My spleen was in its gripe.”
Meanwhile am I with doubting racked —
Which of these fools is I in fact?
VICTORIA.
EDDYSON.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Massey and Ward are after more revenue
from income tax in Maoriland, and propose
to tackle the job with careful regard for the
feelings of Fat. Thus a man with a tax-
able income of £5OO a year will pay at the
rate of Is. Bd'. in the £l, but if his income
leaps up 100 per cent, the tax will only leap
a lifth of that distance —to 2s. The rest of
the leaping from the £5OO mark goes this
way:—•
Taxable amount. Leap of Income. Leap of Tax.
£ feet. inches.
1500 3 4 4.5
2000 4 6
3000 6 9 3-5
4000 8 12
All of which suggests that Ward ought to
explain why when the citizen on the £5OO

N. S. Wales Government announces that
the financial year closed last week with “a
surplus of £149,000.” Of course, this refers
to transactions with the left-hand pocket of
the trousers. Holman can’t get his hand in
the other pocket for the jamb of lOU’s.
The Commonwealth’s haphazard system of
recruiting has broken down in another place.
The halting, stumbling Defence Department
now discovers that there is a serious short-
age of metallurgical and technical chemists
owing to their enlistment in the A.1.F., and
the production of war material is thereby
imperilled. Under the scientific plan
ot universal service the danger would
of course not have arisen; the whole
community would have been put to
its best war use. The Government adhered,
however, to the easy, slipshod policy of
muddling through, and, for any difficulties
that may threaten, it and the deplorable lack
ot system for which it stands must he held
wholly responsible.
Have Australian Railway Departments
suddenly gone mad? A few weeks ago
Queensland, being offered linseed oil of
Australian manufacture, turned it down in
tavor of an Indian article. In that case
tnere was the wisp of an excuse that the
foreign stuff was offered at 3d. per gallon
cheaper. But now the Westralian Railways
have accepted an offer of foreign oil at
os. 3d. and ss. 5d., notwithstanding that an
Australian oil was offered at 4s. 4|d. and
4s. Old. Do the Westralian railway people
really think it is so disastrous for Australia
to have population to carry that it will pay
the railways to give people a bonus to live
somewhere else? That, anyhow, is what this
lunacy amounts to.
Hie Hoskins firm, of Litkgow, bought a
coal mine at Dapto the other day; and the
first the public heard about it was through a
whooping paragraph in the Sydney papers
saying that a boom in land had already
started in the neighborhood. In other words,
because the Hoskinses will put their brains
and money and energy into a property, people
who have just been sitting down and wait-
ing for somebody to come along and do some-
thing are going to put up rents for all time-
tor that is wliat this grab at unearned
movement means. When will the Law stop
this robbery of the public? And in this case
the public includes the Hoskinses, because
inevitably, if men have to pay unnecessarily
high rent, they will have to receive unneces-
sarily high wages; wherefore up will go
costs, and by so much will the chance of
successful competition with the foreigner be
diminished.
Even such a crusted old Conservative as
Health-Minister McLeod has been able to
heave a brick at Geelong. To the
local council was l’ecently sent a
letter notifying an outbreak of in-
fectious disease, the envelope being
marked “urgent” and bearing on its
exterior some inkling of its contents.
But it was unstamped; wherefore
Geelong just sent it back and sat
down again in its wallow. It is this
sort of thing which makes it easier
to understand how a big town like
Geelong, while claiming to be a
health resort, has managed to post-
pone until lately the commencement
of an underground sewage system.
Read Murphy, who recently re-
s' gned his job as P.M. to dive into
Victorian politics, isn’t discouraged
by his unsuccessful effort to depose
butcher Angliss from the Leg. Coun-
cil. He means to try again
as soon, as the chance
offers, and to that end has
gone to live in Melbourne.
Some of his platform is
surprisingly good. He be-
lieves that the large, inade-
quately worked estate is the
curse of a nation. Also he
would do without six of
Australia’s seven Gover-
nors and London agents.
Furthermore, he would
make gaol-dwellers self-
supporting, and he ap-
proves of every male Aus-
tralian being a trained
soldier. In fact, almost the
only suspicious circum-
stance about Murphy’s case
is that he calls himself a
Liberal. Why not just call him-
self Murphy?
Blackburn, M.L.A. (A r ic.), who has
started out on the anti-conscription warpath
again, is consistent in one thing, at any rate.
Nine months ago he said in print that the
German conquest of Australia would hardly
worsen the conditions of the country; and
the place of those who think that a German
conquest wouldn’t matter is plainly with
the anti-conscriptionists. But his attitude
ought to make all other anti-conscriptionists
think hard. If they believe that German
conquest would worsen Australian condi-
tions, what are they doing in the same
galley as Blackburn?
The Minister for Defence continues to
excuse the failure of voluntary enlistment
by hotly declaring that 300,000 men were
never promised. The Bulletin doesn’t
know whether the Minister promised 300,000
TWO BATTLERS AND A BEAR.
or not. But it does know that the Minister’s
chief promised “the last man” ; and the last
man isn’t the 300,000 th or even the 350,000 th.
“Trot” remembers the people:—
Apart altogether from the commercial merits of
Hughes’s 15 steamers, no one can convince me (and
I do not believe it possible to convince anyone else)
that the spending- of two millions by a politician
without authority from Parliament is anything but
rotten. It outrages every principle of Parliamen-
tary Government. It goes to the very heart of
popular rights, and cannot be distinguished from the
issue which John Hampden argued over. Parlia-
mentary control of the cashbox in Australia is a jest.
In the case of the Federal Parliament, criticism of
expenditure follows instead of precedes payment.
Authority for expenditure is taken long after the
money has gone. No country on earth could ever
trust its politicians or leaders or kings to go loose
like this. It is no answer to say that Hughes made
a good bargain. That doesn’t matter. The objection
covers the whole field of public expenditure. What-
ever Australia may gain by allowing Hughes to fill
in a cheque for steamers is not counterbalanced by
what it loses every year through the same loose
system. The Parliamentary surrender of the cash-
box to Ministries is one of the wonders of Australian
politics. And how the public is paying for it! And
how the kid is going to sweat!
By all means let us go on talking vaguely
about ways and means of commercially
smothering the German after we’ve kicked
him out of the various Fronts. While we’re
merely fighting and talking, he’s fighting and
working. Bast summer German commercial
travellers were released from the trenches
and sent to neutral Switzerland to hang on
to German trade there and keep it alive.
Also, long after the war had got into its
stride, French surgeons received circulars
from German artificial limb-makers. It calls
for a bit of speed and energy to beat a nation
which blows its enemy’s leg off and promptly
calls round to sell him a ready-made sub-
stitute.

Australia is liable to get another black-
eye through its bad habit of depending upon
a foreigner who may be liable to drink and
blind staggers for all it knows. Australia
loafs on the U.S.A. for large quantities of
binder-twine —almost in-
dispensable in harvesting
—and the raw material
for most of it is the sisal
hemp of Yucatan, which
is that part of Mexico
now most anxious to
riddle Wilson with bul-
lets. The Yucatan crop
of sisal is worth about
£3,000,000 a year—
mostly financed by New
Orleans.
If he carries out his
present intention, Yic.
Chief Secretary McLeod
will have done one good
deed deserving mention
on his tombstone. He is
going to enable the gaol-
dweller, or a few of him,
to earn his keep and put
by a bit at the end of his
“stretch.” The reform-
subject is to be employed
on a block of land bought
by the Government near
Castlemaine, where he
will grow fruit and vege-
tables and get paid for
doing it. Only a selec-
tion of well-behaved birds
will be permitted out of
the cage at the commence-
ment, but McLeod hopes
to see the scheme en-
larged as the cab-
bage-growring progresses.
Blinking the fact that
the Minister has con-
sidered it necessary to
buy farm-land while the
Crown declares in its pamphlets that it has
lots ot its own, it is a good scheme as far
as it goes, though McLeod isn’t the sort of
enthusiast to push it to a sensible conclu-
sion.
Acting Prime Minister Pearce prattled the
other ddy about “industrial unrest” in the
best manner of the anguished archbishop
with a mixed congregation:—..
=+,.fi hey , con sWer people who indulged in
strikes and lock-outs as unreasonable and unjust,
there were, however, two sides to everv question,
they could only solve the question by approaching
the matter m a reasonable spirit, from the point of
view of the employer as well as that of the em-
ployee.
Phen doesn’t the Acting-Archbishop consider
people .who indulge in strikes and lockouts
unreasonable ! If he doesn’t, it seems only a
decent thing for him to call off Justice
Higgins, who is administering a law which
regards strikes as so unreasonable that they
are declared illegal. Suppose Pearce learns
to approach the question from the point of
view, not of the employer or the employee,
put °t a third party, the community. That
is the entity that a Government is supposed
to represent.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Jullundur’s capture of the G. N. Hurdle
ltace last Saturday was quite in accordance -with the
eternal fitness of things. The son of Challenger was
one of the three youngest horses in the race, and
youth ought to get a fair chance to tell over the
sticks, though the rule is not to put horses to the
jumping game until they have lost a lot of their
spring. Also Jullundur’s good form on the flat, just
prior to the Grand National weights being declared,
was a frank and open exposure of his merits which
the handicapper rewarded by not piling the weight
on him. At lOst. 71b. Jullundur was evidently well
in. He had already won a three-mile hurdle race at
Flemington in record time. But because he had
finished only fourth in a couple of recent races, over
a shorter course, it seemed possible that Jul. had _
started to stale off. Otherwise all followers of the'
guide-books would have preferred him at lOst. 71b.
to Lord Grey at a stone more. Jullundur, who is a
natural rather than an educated jumper, must be one
of the fastest and stoutest racers that ever did well
over the hurdles. The going was heavy on Satur-
day, but he won easily and clipped Jsec. off the
Grand Nat. record, which the 9st. Rathfarnham set
up last year when the ground was firm. Jullundur
has now got two Flemington records to his credit.
He was chased home on Saturday by Van Homreigli,
Lord Grey, Royal Precedent, Beccassine and Boyeo,
the fourth, fifth and sixth being not far away from
the third, who was nearly 10 lengths behind the
winner. Lord Grey began slowly as usual, but the
other five horses were in the leading half-dozen from
start to finish. Nothing fell save Jack Rice, reckoned
the safest jumper in the field. Among the more
fancied of the 17 starters Merrimax, Hypo and Shot
Out ran conspicuously badly.
The hitherto uncertain Meroo made no trouble
about winning the last race on the card at Fleming-
ton on Saturday. Ho went out at (i to I—a1 —a com-
paratively long price against one of Eric Connolly’s
good things, and, with little Eaton up, the good thing
won all the way down the straight. Of four imported
horses that helped to make up the big field Polyga-
mist looked most like a winner in the future.
Lord Grey, with two seconds and a third to his
name, ranks next to Obi for consistent prominence in
G. N. Hurdle racing - . Obi scored two firsts and a
third, but the time was not very good in any in-
stance, whereas it was always fast when Lord Grey
came with a late run. Obi’s sceond win (in 1913)
took a quarter of a minute longer than Jullundur’s.
Bullawarra, in spite of all his weight and his
growing tendency to old age, is reckoned quite a
moral, as morals go, for the G. N. Steeple. If he is
the horse he was when he won the, four-mile Steeple
at Caulfield in 1913, Bullawarra should certainly out-
class the poor field he will meet next Saturday. The
dashing Booligal is under suspicion; Chess, the ex-
hurdler, and Artillery Bill may be better worth
backing on the day ; and Canadium and Highland
Clan are possibles. But none of these is in the same
class as Bullawarra. Nothing can be confidently ex-
pected to beat the old champion after his promising-
display at Williamstown a fortnight ago if he stands
up. A lot of rain before the day is the most likely
thing to beat him. If the going is very heavy the
writer would as soon back Highland Gian as
anything.
The Siege Gun mare Inia has won three
races since James Barden started superintending her
exercise, and her manner of getting away with the
Flying at Canterbury Park on Saturday stamped her
as something above the ordinary. As Inia a few
days earlier had appropriated an event at Rosehill,
beating the flier Boureong, it was surprising to find
McMoses generously offering 9 to 2. Like many
other good ones the mare hails from northern N. S.
Wales. City punters first heard of her when she was
made favorite for the last New England Cup at
Armidale. But the Maorilander Toa Tere landed the
bacon that time at 16 to 1, and Inia also ran.
* * * *
Trainer Billy Kelso has been doing it
twice again. He perpetrated his last joke at Canter-
bury Park on Saturday with Khaf (14 to 1) and
Chid (15 to 1), and if Ikey neglected to meet him
later in a body and give him three cheers then is
there no gratitude in Israel. Apprentice W. Pike
was on top of Khaf. This young member of the
Pike tribe is a brother of Jimmy, who also learned
how to ride winners under Kelso’s tuition. But it
was the trainer’s own son who steered Chid, and it
must have brought to the elder man a surge of mem-
ories. In his day Kelso was good business as a horseman
himself. About the only accident he ever had was
when a domesticated horse slipped from under him
in George-street and broke one of his legs. Kelso
doesn’t ride horses now. He drives with a wheel.
* * * »
The apprentice jock, has become a pest.
On Saturday four of the horde claiming, allowances'
won races on the flat at Canterbury Park, and only one
of the successful nags carried any public confidence
and legal tender. In the Flying 10 of-the 14 runners
were ridden by apprentices. It seems about time the
A.J.C. put up its hand to stop the traffic. Weight-
adjusters handicap on the assumption that each
animal will carry its allotted burden in the event of
starting. When claims are made for allowances of
71b. and 31b. because the riders have not ridden their
share of winners, weights count for nothing, and
any brains that may have been employed in the
effort to compile them are wasted. Even if owners
are keen on having inexperienced boys on their prads
that is no reason why the public should not be pro-
tected by requiring every horse to start from the
right mark.

“Dalriada”: When the final acceptances
for Flemington Grand National Hurdle were declared,
on June 30. the list concluded with this unconscious
aphorism: “Unlikely Starter —Purse Filler.” The
result of the race bore out the forecast.
* * * *
Pony racing continues to boom around
Sydney. Three meetings a week have been the
average lately, and last Saturday it was necessary
to run 13 separate races to accommodate all the
entries and get all the bets in. For the next meet-
ing listed the handieapper was called on to allot
weights to 188 diminutive animals masquerading as
“racehorses.” But of course the “sport” is splendid
and affords employment to many undeserving citi-
zens, and the encouragement given to breeding
thoroughbreds is stupendous.
Died a few days ago in Westralia, Reg
Pell, the best-known handieapper and one of the
best-known sportsmen in the State. lie was the
big-hearted son of Professor Pell, the great mathe-
matician who helped to found the A.M.P. Society;
but in his youth he preferred athletics to study, and
was the honorary referee at most of the big battles
which were fought at Broken Hill in the days of the
great boom. In that boom Pell made a comfortable
fortune; but he came to Sydney, and it was soon
taken from him on the turf.
The stake for the M.L. Trotting Cup, to
be run at Christchurch (M.L.) in November, remains
at V 2500. The first past the post collects £l5OO
and a cup, second £5OO, third £3OO, and fourth
£2OO. But pursuit of the cash and crockery this
year is confined to prads that have left two miles
behind in an actual race in 4min. 30see. or better.
This will limit entries considerably.

“Up Stage”: We were touring Taranaki
(M.L.), and had just comfortably settled in the hack
parlor after the show, when the sport entered. After
the third round he professed his admiration for
actors generally, and confided that his pony—Gin

next day. We thought it was time for bed ! “No,
bli'me, I ain’t puttin’ it up to yer like thet. Come

treasury was very thin ; but the sport seemed sincere,
and, anyway, it looked morally certain that we’d have
to “teli the tale” to get out of the town. Follow-
ing afternoon we found the typical bush racecourse.

of the course and hid the back, so that when the
horses rounded the turn out of the straight the
punters lost sight of them for about four furlongs.
We got long odds about Gin Fizz; and informa-
tion that he “hadn’t a ghost” floated in from every
side. The sport was, notwithstanding all this,
mysteriously optimistic. “Don’t worry, boys,” he
assured us. “Jim’s the only boy in this race that's
ridden ’ere before.” Turning out of the straight
Gin Fizz was last; but the sport was convulsed with
unholy glee. “Now jes’ wait,” he whispered. “He's
got to fall down to lose!” Anxious years seemed
to pass ; then Gin Fizz flashed into view with a lead
of six lengths, and reached the post with a neck to
spare. We got very enthusiastic over Gin Fizz’s
wonderful sprint along the back. The sport smiled.
“Sprint be blowed!” he said. “Jim was the only
one who knew the short cut!”

Though pigeon racing has not much vogue
as a sport it is a desperately calmest business with
those who do make it a hobby. Over 1000 birds
were let loose in Bundanoon last Saturday to fly 100
miles to Sydney. Many birds never get back in
these contests, the first cause of mortality being the
valiant sportsman with a gun who waits for the
scurry homewards. This Hun-like trick is a
penai offence, but the offenders are hard to catch,
being usually dug into a place of safety from attack
by infuriated pigeons or J. Hops.
After Jimmy Hill (N.S.W.) and Bert
Spargo (Vie.) had been wrangling over the feather-
weight championship for 20 rounds at Sydney Sta-
dium on Saturday, the verdict of Arthur Scott was
a draw. It was one of those contests in which any
decision would have been challenged, for the house
was full of heated partisans, and the styles of the
two battlers were in marked contrast. In the
judgment of this writer Hill outpointed his enemy,
but point-scoring in these disturbances is a mys-
terious business. If Scott reckoned that Spargo
by his superiority at infighting, scored as
rapidly as Hill did at longer range, and
that the Victorian’s aggressiveness was entitled to
as much weight as Hill’s elusiyeness, then he was
right. There would be much justification for this
view. But from the point of view of pure skill
with the gloves Hill seemed to have a substantial
lead. His hitting was quicker and more varied ; his
defence more effective. But he hardly deliv-
ered a punch that was not short weight. And, Loid,
how far was it he ran?
It was Spargo who made the fight. He put an
enormous amount of work into it, was nearly always
the aggressor, and showed the greater courage ana
endurance. He never cut it once. Hill did,
several times. Twice at least he could have von
had he been as anxious to go on as he was to hop
away. Still, the Victorian was a bit of a disap-
pointment, and it is hard to imagine lnm seeing
20 rounds through with a good boxer carrying an
emphatic punch, for he leaves himself gaping wide
open for injurious attention on the jaw nearly eveiy
time he uses his left. Hill got him there several times,
but it was only the glove that hit; neither arm nor
shoulder was behind it. It was a fast, strenuous
engagement from first to last —one of the most spec-
tacular seen at the Stadium for many a day. Of
course there will be another encounter, but unless
Spargo can learn to deliver his thump more rapidly
lie stands a good chance of not delivering it at all.

Cabled tliat Jack Dillon whipped Frank
Moran at New York over 10 rounds. It was a
sure thing to happen, anyhow, and puts Moi an where
he ought to be.- The next sure thing to happen
is a wHd yell in Jess Willard’s ear to take notice
of Dillon, and there are good judges who reckon Wil-
lard would find him a tough job. Dillon)is 5 25 and
has been fighting for eight years. McGoorty outed
him once in round four. Buck Crouse, Gus Christie

Beals Wright, sent to these parts by
Uncle Sam in 1908 with F. B. Alexander to tear the
Davis Cup from Brookes and Wilding, leaped into
the limelight the other day just in time to be seized
by bis famous bad luck, and be yanked out again.
It was at Honolulu, and a lot of Yankee cracks, in-
cluding Griffin, Dawson, Rohlfs and Low, were after
the local championship. Wright got through to the
semi-final, and looked like winning, but when shaving
himself next morning put the razor deep into his
thumb. He only lasted two sets, and then Dawson
took the bauble. Wright was playing as well as
ever he did, and may be heard of doing big things
again in the future —that is, if there is any future.
The Speck’s final cricket spasm didn’t
take place till May, and the averages have only
just appeared. A. C. Newton (S. Hobart) tops the
batting averages with 574 runs; av., 57.4. K. E.
Watt (E. Hobart) was second with 452 runs; av.,
45 2 In bowling the positions are reversed. Watt
heads the list with 56 for 11.92 apiece. Newton (<0
wickets, av. 12.30) is runner-up. Newton s haul ot
70 wickets and his position at the head of the bat-
ting averages constitute a record for the State, the
nearest approach was 09 wickets (highest) and 590
runs (second), by the prolonged C. J. Eady, in
1905-6. -
A motor record which had gathered the
dust of nine years was swept off the slate last
month at New York speedway, when Yankee drive,
R Mulford whizzed over 1819 miles m 24 hour. .
S F Edge (Eng.) held the previous figures (180 l
miles 1350yd5.). The distance averaged per horn
was 75 miles. Mulford, who stuck to the wheel
throughout, had a busy day. Later on he won a
50 miles race in 28min. 45 4-ssec. And over at Cone
Island a car driven by one Aiken rushed ovei
miles in llmin. 15 4-ssec. All of which shows
there was moving. * #
The march of the motor! Three years ago
the Goodyear Co. was turning 5000 tyres a day out
of its factory at Akron (U.S.A.) 0n f JU U\h a
the boss stopped chewing gum for 3sec. to dash a
cable message to Sydney announcing that the output
on that date was 29,976 tyres—a record. Looks
as if the horse is being hustled into the museum
quicker than he # .
The rift between the N.S.W. Howling
Association (Sydney) and the Northern District
Association (Newcastle) has widened into something
that looks like a ditch. the truth at the
bottom of the chasm is that Newcastle and Sydney
don’t mix well. The N.D.A. objects to the parent
which bosses the bowls in the State being made up
of delegates from affiliated clubs instead of from
affiliated bodies. The meeting held to patch up
neaee and entice the errant coalies back to the told
ended with respectable old gentlemen saying most
frightful things, and at present benevolent bowlers
are more bitterly divided than the footballers and
baseballers. By the way, why is it that these strenu-
ous pastimes make everybody so savage t Is there
any real recreation in having a row?
Killed somewhere in France, Lieut.
Murdoch, a son of Jas., M.L.C. “Billy” in his time
was a topnotch footballer in the Speck and represented
Tasmania against mainland teams. #
There appears to have been a vacancy in
the sporting literature of the age, because no one
had compiled a manual and record book devoted to
skating. Well, the vacancy has now been filled by
A. Smith, who has produced an Australian handbook
on roller- and ice-skating 1 . It looks as if the authoi
has gone to infinite trouble over his work. Anyhow,
he has gathered up a vast amount of information
and records and many photographs. Australians are
not the best in the world on ice, on account of the
severity of the winters, but they have done things in
rinks, and if anyone wants to find out all about it
the ljrice is only a shilling.

Tasman Peninsula, the lower half of the
double protrusion from the south-east corner of the
Speck, which early navigators took for a couple
of islands till Baudin’s expedition proved the con-
trary, was turned into a real island the other day.
A hard south-easterly gale brought up a tremendous
sea which broke right through Eaglehawk Neck into
Norfolk Bay. The sea drove an immense number o
perch into the inner bay and local anglers hooked
out 1800 of them in an hour.
“Corio”: “A.B.’s” methods of landing cod
(B 8/6/’l6) are at present in disfavor with the bush
sages.' Give ’em the cross or set lines every time.
The cross line is merely a cord extending from bank
to bank with hooks placed at intervals of two or
three feet. The set-line runs parallel with the bank,
and may extend for a mile or so. Cricket and wood-
grub bait is generally used. But when he goes fish-
ing personally the sage shows the cod a point or
two If shrimp is on the menu well, and good, but
sometimes the animal prefers crayfish or worm His
appetite is very eccentric. At Meniridie (N.S.W.) 1
have landed him with a piece of raw beef, and
successfully used red rag as a signal for breakfast.

used portions of cod itself, and succeeded m getting a
meal. 1 never tried it, but Outback hands tell how
Wallaby Joe once hooked a hundred cod with black
snake as bait. “It wuz boshter, too,” so they say.

THE LAST LAP
or
The Finish of the Argument.
ON THE 6th JULY, 1912,
The General Manager of
The Australian Mutual Provident Society
Mr. RICHARD TEECE, F.1.A., F.F.A., F.A.S., F.S.S., J.P.,
wrote to the Managing Director of
The City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd.
Mr. GEORGE CROWLEY, as follows:
“I shall be glad if you will furnish me with specimen bonuses for the first five years
in respect of a policy similar to that in question.”
The policy “similar to that in question” was a policy for £2OOO on the life of
Mr. Arthur Rickard, of Messrs. Arthur Rickard & Co., Realty Specialists, Pitt Street,
Sydney, New South Wales.
The A.M.P. Society issued a policy, No. 9,139,813, in November, 1911, £2OOO on
Mr. Rickard’s life at a premium of £7O per annum.
The City Mutual, within a few days of this date —possibly a week earlier or a
week later—issued a policy, No. 106,583, for £2OOO on Mr. Rickard’s life at a premium
also of £7O per annum.
BOTH POLICIES WERE, THEREFORE, IDENTICAL IN EVERY RESPECT.
The discussion hinged on the much-debated question as to which class of office in
Australia would yield the best results to its policy-holders—the compact Institution
with £1,000,000 or so of easily-invested funds, or the Leviathan with many tens of
millions.
Keeping in view, of course, all the time tliat_the liabilities of the larger office to
its constituents were in the vicinity of £80,000,000 as against the smaller Society’s
£4,000,000 or so.
So that here was a clear-cut opportunity for a straight-out, honest test. It was to
be a fair go.
Needless to say, no exception was to be made in the case of Mr. Rickard’s policy
by either office. It was to be treated exactly the same as each and every other
policy issued that year by each office under the ordinary Whole Life Table —the
true embodiment of Life Assurance, pure and simple. No difference whatever of any
sort was to be made.
That, naturally, was the very first and most primary element of fairness if the test
was to be of the slightest value at all, otherwise the whole thing would have been a farce
between two offices of standing.
Here are the results for the five years of the
AUSTRALIAN MUTUAL PROVIDENT SOCIETY
Here are the results for the five years of the
CITY MUTUAL LIFE:
This is the Last Lap —the Finish
of the Argument.
It is only fair, however, to the A.M.P. Society to say that the figures for 1016 are
affected somewhat by the very heavy claims arising out of the War. Otherwise the
bonuses for 1916, according to Mr. Teece, might have exceeded even £3B, the 1915
figures.
Now that the controversy is ended, just a few —a very few—words in conclusion.
The City Mutual takes its hat off all the time in admiration for the great and
enduring work which the pioneer office of Australia has done during the past 67 years.
It trusts that a friendly spirit will always prevail between the two offices.
There is plenty of room for both in the Commonwealth.
They are both purely Mutual Institutions, the policy-holders—and the policy-holders
alone —manage each ; the whole of the profits of each office go to the policy-holders—and
the policy-holders only—and they are both, each in its own way, capable of doing
abiding service to many millions of Australians.

N.s.w. THE SNAKE.
“Y.Z.”: The assumption that politicians
( would work if they did not talk so much is
now smashed by experience. • When a poli-
tician is holding his tongue he has his hands
full.
From a Westralian Gallery hand : —-
Representatives of the Country party and the
Liberal League recently held a pow-wow behind
closed doors, with the object of giving the Scaddan
Government the knock-out when Parliament meets
on July 13, or thereabout. It was agreed with
absolute unanimity that the Labor Government was
a menace to this bled and bleeding country. But
there the conference stuck hard. What the Hayseed
party really wanted was to attach the Liberal crowd
firmly to its tail. The Hayseeds’ original idea of a
working agreement with the Libs, was that it should
be given immunity from Liberal opposition in 21
electorates out of the total of 50, and that the party
which won the greater number should form a Min-
istry and receive the support of the other section.
A simple calculation caused the Libs, to heave an
iceberg at the proposition. It meant that the
Liberals were to surrender all chance of Ministerial
office for the benefit of their country cousins, who
now hold—with considerable uncertainty—eight seats.
The Liberals’ counter-proposition was that Liberals
and Country party nominees should be free to con-
test any electorate, but that each party should
pledge itself to give its second preference to the
other fellow. As the exercise of the preference vote
is compulsory, this suggestion was sound enough,
but the “farmers’ friends” turned it down hard.
So the only definite result of the conference was a
pious agreement that the party in possession should
be fired out at the earliest opportunity, and this
practically assures that Scaddan will have to hawk
its fearful financial record before the electors within
two or three months.
“City Temple.—The foundation stone will
not be laid this afternoon.” This curt advt.
in the Adelaide dailies of last Saturday has
set that city talking more than ever about
the affairs of Paul Joseph, the young Con-
gregational parson with a Tasmanian legacy
at liis back. He accepted the pastorate of the
old-established Hindmarsh-square Church six
months ago, on condition that it would move
with him into a new “Temple” (with soda-
fountain and other American aids to salva-
tion) to be built on North Terrace. After-
wards he paid £6OOO for the late Chief Jus-
tice Way’s old home, to be used somehow in
connection with the work. Then the
“Temple” began to arise, but just as it got
to the conventional foundation-stone height
work ceased. Also these things happened:
(1) Mr. Joseph resigned his Hindmarsh-
square job; (2) an inquisitive reporter got
a statement from him that he means to work
on broader unsectarian lines, and that the
Temple foundation would be duly laid on the
coming Saturday by his father-in-law, the
veteran Dr. Bevan; (3) it wasn’t. Hence
the guessing.
Just-dead H. E. A. Wells, of Mudgee, was
son of that surveyor Wells who in the ’4o’s
published a very useful directory of N. S.
Wales —now a valuable work. Amongst the
advertisers, by the way, was “Henry Parkes,
ivory and bone turner,” who then kept a
little shop in Hunter-street, Sydney.
Young Robert Gillespie, among those now
admitted killed at Gallipoli last year, was
one of Melbourne Uni.’s rare bachelors of
agricultural science. He was the eldest son
of well-known financial expert James Gil-
lespie, and a grandson of that Robert
of the ilk who for many years was a broad
pillar of the Presbyterian Church in Aus-
tralia.
The daylight-saving idea is being illus-
trated at the head of the rail west from Port
Augusta. The line is now pushed out over
360 miles, and as Adelaide time is used
the clock easilv beats the sun, and the differ-
ence in the length of the evening is very
noticeable. An interesting timekeeper’s argu-
ment will start when the gap of 290 miles is
bridged and East and West shake hands.
On the Kalgoorlie side the railway men use
Perth time, while Adelaide bosses the
watches from Port Augusta.

If there’s any whiskv-in-the-cupboard crowd
can beat that, let them bring forth their
banner and give the drum a wallop.
“P.X.”: According to the Glasgow
correspondent of the Daily News, Prime
Minister Hughes, talking to a big Town
Hall crowd there, “told what Australia had
done in Imperial interests, as well as in
her own, to help on the cause in the matter
of wheat. The Government offered a mini-
mum price for all grain delivered by
farmers at the railway sidings of the great
Southern Continent. The result of that
inducement to put virgin land under wheat
was that the production had been multi-
plied by two and a half times what it was
before.” This gives a very fair idea of the
sort of guff Hughes has been feeding ’em
on in England; also it gives a very fair
indication of the sort of person Hughes is.
The fact, of course, is that one State, N. S.
Wales, guaranteed a minimum for the wheat
harvested from excess ground—very little of
it virgin ground, by the way. And to prove
that the huge' crop was not the result of
that offer it is merely necessary to say that,
according to the Commonwealth Govern-
ments own statist, the increase in yield of
Victoria, where no such offer was in exist-
ence, was from 32 millions in 1913 to 58
millions in 1915, and of S. Australia from
16 millions to 34 millions. As a matter of
fact, so far from the offer in N. S. Wales
inducing the State to put virgin land under
wheat, Knibbs shows that the area under
wheat in N. S. Wales in 1914 was 3,205,397
acres, whereas in 1915, when the offer was
in force, it was only 2,758,024 acres.

ITHOUT imagination the mind of any man or woman
becomes stagnant and uninteresting. Instead of harbouring
sweet fields overrun with the flowers of fancy, there is
but an arid desert of undeveloped thought. This is not right. The
imaginative faculty is necessary to the highest development of intellect
and should be stimulated in every possible way. Good books, good
pictures and, above all, good music should be part and parcel
of one’s every day life.

Ue BEALE PLAYER PIANO
Is an instrument which can
be really played by those
who have no piano tech-
nique. By its aid they can know the joy of
actually interpreting any or all of the finest
music ever written for the Pianoforte. They
can wander fancy-free amongst the fairest
gardens which their thoughts contain, and
express the most profound musical emotions in
a manner which no other instrument can
duplicate. Yet, the instrument may, at all
times, he converted for hand playing in less
than sixteen seconds. If you can call we shall
have pleasure in playing you a selection by
your favorite composer. It will be an experi-
ence you will enjoy and will demonstrate
beyond doubt that Australian - made goods
can be superior to the imported.

A FACT.
Our bread is now made by most modern
methods, which rob it of the nourishing
constituents, and is the chief cause of
Fermentative Dyspepsia.
Continued eating of fresh white bread
causes acute indigestion, with all its
accompanying ailments, wind, acid ris-
ings, bad memory, sour stomach, consti-
pation. headache. Of course, hard physi-
cal workers throw off these ailments, but
people living sedentary lives cannot over-
come them, and they fall info bad health
and feel very wretched. If you have
indigestion in any form take a course
of Fisher’s Phospherine half an hour
after meals and you will soon feel well
and look on the bright side of life.
Fisher’s Phospherine is sold by all
Chemists and Stores at Is. and 2s. Gd.

How to Treat Your Hair and Complexion.
A Few Simple Beauty Hints,
By Mdlle. GABY DESLYS, the well-known Parisian Actress.
YOU ask me for a few hints on the
treatment of the hair and complexion.
Well, the less “treatment” you give
thing is a good shampoo. Never use any-
thing inferior to wash the hair with. (let
some good stallax from your chemist and use
the skin the better. I do not
believe much in massage, but a
little cream to the face is neces-
sary to counteract the effects of
wind or sun. What cream
would I recommend? Well, I
advise you to use a little mer-
colised wax every night and
again in the morning, after
washing the face. Hub _it
gently into the skin, then wipe
off any superfluous wax and
dust a little barri-agar over
the face. You will find that
this will be the only “treat-
ment” necessary and will keep
your face fresh and youthful-

looking for all your life. The mercolised
wax removes all the dead outer skin, so
that you have always a fair, fresh com-
plexion like a girl’s.
For the hair, the first and most important
a teaspoonful in a cup of hot
water. Then rinse the hair
well and it will look bright and
glossy.
A tonic is necessary when the
hair is inclined to fall out more
than it should, and is always
good to use during the spring
and autumn. Then the hair
needs a little—what do you call
it? —stimulant, and for this I
would advise you to get a packet
of boranium and mix it with
some bay rum ; dab this into the
roots and it will not only stop
the fall, but make your hair
grow long and thick, (five your
hair a good brushing every night, and tha
will be all that you need do.
h
Blackheads Fly Away.
Instantaneous Remedy for Blackheads, Greasy Skin and Enlarged Pores.
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged pores,
recently discovered, is now coining into
general use in the boudoir. It is very
simple, harmless and pleasant. Drop a
stymol tablet, obtained at the chemist’s, in
a tumblerful of hot water. After the effer-
vescence has subsided bathe the face in the
liquid, using a small sponge or soft cloth.
In a few minutes dry the face and the offen-
sive blackheads will come right off on the
towel. Also the large oily pores immedi-
ately close up and efface themselves natu-
rally. The greasiness disappears and the
skin is left smooth, soft and cool. This
simple treatment is then repeated a few
times at intervals of four or five days, to
ensure the permanence of the result.
Grey Hair—Home Remedy.
An old-fashioned Recipe restores Youthful Appearance.
There are plenty of reasons why grey
hair is not desirable, and plenty of reasons
why hair dyes should not be used. But, on
the other hand, there is no reason why you
should have grey hair if you do not want
it. To turn the hair back to a natural color
is really a very simple matter. One has
only to get from the chemist two ounces of
concentrate of tammalite and mix it with
three ounces of bay rum. Apply to the
hair with a small sponge for a few nights
and the greyness will gradually disappear.
This liquid is not sticky or greasy and does
not injure the hair in any way. It has been
used for generations with most satisfactory
results by those who have known the
formula.
To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
The most Effective Formula ever Discovered,
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
to kill the hair roots permanently. For
this purpose pure powdered pheminol may be
applied directly to the objectionable hair
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the
hair but also to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol, obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
Good News for Fat People.
Something New in Obesity Cures.
A London chemist says: “The latest
method of reducing obesity certainly is far
more pleasant and convenient than all pre-
vious methods. It consists merely in eating
clynol berries. The fat person who wants
to reduce without the usual rigid diet, exer-
cise, sweating baths, etc., now puts a few
of these little brown berries in his or her
pocket and eats three or four each day.”
Clynol berries not only eliminate fat from
the body, but also correct the tendency,
which is usually constitutional, to create
fatty matter. No discomfort whatever is
caused by their action; in fact, except for
the loss of superfluous fat and the feeling
of “fitness” so created, you would not be
aware that these little berries were doing
their work.
Local inquiry shows that clynol berries are
not very well known in this country, but
the demand is increasing daily, and any
chemist can quickly procure them if specially
requested to do so.

Indeed there is the greatest danger
And matrimony haunts a stranger;
Artlessly they spread the net,
Both the blonde and the brunette ;
Out of Allan’s Music Store
They cast upon the flames that roar
Fifty old pianos in one pile,
And spread them with the kerosene ilc;
Viewing this awful holocaust
I felt like Mephisto squelching Faust.

When Massey and Ward tear themselves
away from Maoriland shortly and link up
with High Commissioner Tom Mackenzie,
there will be then in London three men who
have had the boss political job in Maoriland.
One of them is a Bart., the other is deco-
rated “Sir.” and Massey is just plain Bill,
with an alarming habit of explosive mirth
at his own jokes. In the days when the
Mackenzie was Minister for Agriculture
plain Bill’s most bitter criticism of him was
that he didn’t know a ram from a gentle-
man Ayrshire. Whereupon he would break
into the loud laugh of derision and Thomas
would volubly hurl back the allegation.
Massey would never consent to follow
Hughes in the purchase of 15 steamers, but
if he sees a nice line of heifers going cheap
he is almost sure to bring them back for the
further cementing of the Empire.
“The Gink”: Somebody should tell the
Commonwealth Public Service that the
recruiting posters are still on the walls.
Two good fellows of my acquaintance
applied at the beginning of April for permis-
sion to enlist. They were duly advised
by their department that when relief was
available they would be allowed to go. It
is now the end of June, and they are still
being held down in their chairs while ex-
cited M’s.P. are abroad semaphoring for
Empire-savers. In another case a young
officer in a hurry to do his duty by his
country did not wait for the official sanc-
tion, but got into camp. The prompt patriot
was informed that there would be no job
waiting for him when he got back. Another
zealous young man asked permission to go
to the Front with the Y.M.C.A. or to enlist
in the ordinary way. lie was told that as
his was the first case of its kind to come
under notice it must be sent to something
called “the Central Administration” for a
ruling—a three months’ job at least. If
some of this foolish obstruction could be
lifted off the national rails, the country
might be saved the cost of the recruiting
trains.
Ivan is coming, yes coming from afar,
Through the snow and marsh.
Sec his bayonet glistening, on he goes to war,
And although his song is harsh,
lie does not spear babies like Willie the Hub,
Look out, Willie 1 lie’s coming, run!
When he gets to Berlin, then he’ll begin,
And he’ll put the Huns in the dust all right.
Now I seem to hear him coming through the night,
And I wake with a fitful start.
With a wild and beating heart.
But he’s coming, so I know it’s all right.

Diamonds Reduced Enormously.
Four years ago we took on a
Sole Agency calling for an enor-
mous output of Diamonds, and,
with a view to making the turn-
over, we offered them at merely
a broker’s commission on the.
Antwerp cutter’s cost.
It barely paid us the first year;
the seconcl year the sales were so
great it did better ; and the third
year better still; and so we are
continuing the experiment further.
We only stock the best grades of Diamonds, but our prices for these are THE LOWEST.
There is no duty on Diamonds.
We are the Sole Agents for one of the largest cutters of Antwerp and Amsterdam.

T HER E is no disappoint-
ment when you use
O-Cedar Polish as directed.
After all, it is the sim-
plest and easiest way.
Just remember this:
Use O-Cedar Polish with
water. Simply dampen
a cloth with water, wring
it almost dry and add as
much O-Cedar Polish as
the cloth contains water.
Go over the article to be
polished, watch how the
dirt, dust and scum disappear,
notice how the beauty of the grain
appears, see how ‘lively’, bright
and fresh the varnish looks. Then
a few rubs with a dry cloth pro-
duces the desired lustre.
Apply O-Cedar Polish to your
dusting cloth (as you use it daily)
to retain the lustre.
As you see the results O-Cedar Polish
brings about you will realize that O-Cedar
is more than a polish, because it Cleana
as it Polishes.

[Registered in principal countries]

It is quite enough to transform all the furniture in the average house
to a sparkling, olean brilliancy.
Then you will want more. The large size
bottle contains three times as much as
the small size bottle, yet costs barely more
than twice as much.
Buy the larger sizes of O-Cedar Polish.
It is the economical way. You not only
save money, but also time and work as well.

Little Lectures
by Nurse 'Wincarnis/
(Lecture No i.)
Anaemia
Our blood is composed of
red and white corpuscles—
the red to nourish the body,
the white to fight disease.
In Anaemia—or bloodless-
ness —the red corpuscles are
more or less deficient. Thus
the blood cannot provide
sufficient nourishment for
the body. Therefore the
face becomes white and
“pasty”—the eyes become
dull and “ heavy ” —and a
feeling of intense weariness
pervades the whole system.
To overcome Anaemia, the
blood supply needs re-
charging with red corpuscles.
And it is here that
h
possesses such wonderful
power. Because, being a
blood-maker, ‘ Wincarnis ’
creates a wealth of new, rich,
red blood, which brings the
roses back to the cheeks —
gives a sparkle to the eyes
—and surcharges the whole
body with new vitality and
new life.

FRUIT LAXATIVE FOR MAMMA, DAD,
DABY, CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS
Better than calomel, oil or pills to
clean and regulate liver,
bowels and stomach.
Mother, daddy and the children can always
keep feeling fine by taking this delicious
fruit laxative as occasion demands. Nothing
else cleanses the stomach, liver and bowels
so thoroughly without griping.
You take a little at night, and in the
morning all the foul, constipated waste, sour
bile and fermenting food delayed in the
bowels gently moves out of the system. When
you awaken all headache, indigestion, sour-
ness, foul taste, bad breath, fever and dizzi-
ness are gone ; your stomach is sweet, liver
and bowels clean, and you feel grand.
California Syrup of Figs—“Califig”—is a
family laxative. Everyone from grandpa to
baby can safely take it, and no one is ever
disappointed in its pleasant action. Millions
of mothers know that it is the ideal laxative
to give cross, sick, feverish children. Ask
your chemist for a bottle of “Califig”—Cali-
fornia Syrup of Figs—which has directions
for babies, children of all ages, and for
grown-ups plainly on the bottle. Remember,
imitations are sometimes substituted, so look-
and see that your bottle bears the name of
California Fig Syrup Company. Hand back
with contempt any other fig syrup. “Califig”
—California Syrup of Figs—is sold by all
chemists in bottles of two sizes, Is. lsd. and
Is. 9d. [7

Cholmondley Fitzmaggbt” from Egypt :
Here in the Combined Training and General Base
Depot, the A.I.F. canteen offers a good assortment
of tinned fruit for sale, and one of the most
popular things with the men is pineapple. But it
is all from the Singapore packing houses, and cannot
compaie with the canned product of Queensland;
both in quality and get-up it is inferior. All the
other tinned fruits are good Australian. Why this
discrimination against one fine fruit and a ' home
industry that needs encouragement?
“Quidam : Re the Macartneys (B.
29/G/’l6). Baronet Sir John died in Rock-
hampton some time ago, and his wife pre-
deceased him by several years. The old
man, who was over 70 when he left, was
one of the pioneers of Queensland, and a
well-known identity of the Port Mac-kay dis-
trict in the early days. He then owned
I orest Hills station, but later on, like most
of his squatting contemporaries, fell on evil
times, and when he passed out practically
owned nothing but his title, a possession
which carried no pecuniary benefit. As he
left behind him seven sons, Queensland is
likely to number at least one hereditary
title among its possessions for some time.
To poor old Sir John, who saw death com-
ing in a particularly painful and unpleasant
fashion for years, the title was only a
reminder that such things without health
and wealth are dreadfully hollow bubbles.
Jos. Campbell, of Cairns, has been busy
showing that in yet another line Australia
can be independent of the foreigner.
Attacking blady grass ( lulling) with vigor
he has found that it yields 60 per cent,
weight of commercial paper-pulp. The cost
delivered to boiling works would be 20s. a
ton; and crude paper-pulp could be turned
out at about £5 Bs. a ton. Cane tops, says
the inventor, can be similarly utilised. So
far there has been no frantic haste on the
part of the local newspapers to investigate.
If the discovery had been made by a small
imported person with a large accent, he
would have had a better chance of being
hailed as a deliverer.
“T. 0.1.”: F. T. Brentnall, of the Brisbane
Telegraph, has a unique record. When
Methodist minister at Wagga he performed
the marriage ceremony between the Ticli-
borne claimant, Tom Castro, alias Orton,
and the lady whose affection he secured.
Mr. Brentnall was one of five Methodist
ministers who arrived in Sydney in 1864,
but after some years’ service a throat affec-
tion drove him to ink.
An old mate’s send-off:—
Died at Sydney on Saturday E. B. Torpy, who left
a mark on Queensland mining and drove the lowest
level at 43. An Adelaide boy, he was a cub re-
porter on the Broken Hill Argus in ’BB, then went
to Jo’burg, and while reporter on the Star distin-
guished himself by punching Barny Barnato —a mean
millionaire who borrowed a liver from the boy-
reporter and refused repayment. Torpy was at Cool-
gardie, having the common Australian disease of fol-
lowing mining camps, and in ’9B he went to Chilla-
goe. There he built three hotels for the copper
boom guaranteed by Alex. Stewart; but when the
railway and smelters were completed they found the
ore had been forgotten. One of Torpy’s hotels took
two and sixpence the first day and another’s receipts
were ninepence. Drinks cost a shilling, hue 9d. was
all the solitary customer had. Always tremendously
energetic and very active as are so many heavy men,
i orpy opened the Chillagoe-Ruddigore, Crooked
TILE TELLER.

Creek, and a lot of shows in the squibby field of
Gurramba. He was a teetotaller; knew a horse and
backed him; was a close, cool and intrepid poker
player. He died as courageously as he lived, taking
the long agony of 18 months’ wasting to the weak-
ness of water from Bright’s disease as cheerfully as
he took his best luck. A good sport, a good miner,
and a good Australian ; and Australia is the poorer
for losing his kindly, courageous personality.
“Cleveland”: My own experience is that
the cochineal insect has no wages board,
recognises no hours, saints’ days or holi-
days, and will clear a patch of the spiny
pear in about three months. All that is
necessary is to place an infected leaf among
the stuff and be handy with a match about
12 weeks later to set light to the debris.
The insect attacks leaves, stems and exposed
roots, and doesn’t let go as long as there
is a drain of moisture to be extracted. It
increases and spreads with remarkable
rapidity, and then dies when there is no
more pear tucker available. Incidentally,
a Commission appointed by the Government
toured comfortably round the world in quest
of information about this insect; yet the
public only hears of the doings of an im-
ported expert out Dulacca way, and not a
whisper of the report of the expensive Com-
mission.
A hideous story was told in Brisbane
Police Court the other day, after a man
had been hauled all the way from a Surat
station on two charges of unnatural assault
committed on boys of 13. According to the
boys’ evidence, they visited the Brisbane
Baths several times in the middle of March
to practise for a swimming carnival. The
accused was employed as an assistant, and
was alleged to have committed the assaults
during these visits. But the crowning horror
was to come. About a fortnight later a
medical examination revealed that both the
boys were suffering from syphilis; and the
State medical officer (Dr. A. S. Roe) gave
evidence that the accused was suffering
from the disease. The accused, who reserved
his defence, has been committed for trial.
A further horror of the case was that all
the witnesses kissed the same dirty old
Book, although it was stated in evidence
that the two principal witnesses were still
under treatment for syphilis.
Customs Minister Tudor explained at Bris-
bane the other day that “high freights would
rule for a long time to come and afford Aus-
tralia an incalculable measure of Protection.’’
Well, freights have been sky-high these last
18 months, and imports have poured into the
country like 15 floods. The result of the
high freights has been to (1) force up the
price of imported goods to the Australian
buyer; (21 to increase the cost of many
things required in Australian industry; (3)
to make the importing disease a more harrow-
ing business than ever, because in addition
to having to pay the foreign manufacturer
the foreign shipowner gets heavy ransom.
The would-be Australian manufacturer wants
above all things an assured Protection; and
it isn’t likely that he will lay out money on
the horribly uncertain Protection that tem-
porary high freights give him.

The velvet rosiness of hoya hearts;
The seagull as from blue to blue it darts;
Bird throats that pulse with rapture when
they sing;
Women’s soft lips and the close cling of
arms ;
Sunlight in yellow hair, and brown eyes bent
Over our own in an achieved content;
Rich sunset skies behind black, ragged
palms;

That mirror Day’s red passion ere lie dies
Along the arched intensity, in skies,
Paling to tardy.greyness of regret!
Gather ye memories!
Whispered and radiant words in midnight
hours;
Gleam of white statues in a gallery ;
An open window with a sweep of sea,
And brown bees in the golden cups of
flowers;
Pink Natal grasses blowing on a rise ;
Slim pine trees in a silent, inland place;
In some musk grove cool lingers on your
face,
And the eternal mystery of eyes;
A line of verse that aches with sombre fire,
A phrase that rings with tramp of marching
feet;
The scent of grasses, trodden, warm and
sweet,
And silver moonlit nights of soul-desire!
Gather ye memories!

These threads of scarlet on a web of gold.
Fold them about your heart. When you are

Brisbane, July 1,191 G.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
As usual, armed collectors were out duriug
the week. Friday was Nurse Caveil’s Day
in aid of the War Nurses’ Fund, and over
£5OO was raised.
On Wednesday night, at the Albert Hall,
his Ex., on behalf of the subscribers, handed
over £2OO. a flue invalid chair and a walking-
stick to Lieut. Maurice Little, an Anzac who
gave his sight and his right hand for his
country. Mrs. Little, who met and married
the Lieut, after he had been wounded, was a
medical missionary in the Soudan, and
offered her services to a military hospital
when the war started.
The Toowone Oirls’ Patriotic Club, which
has done splendid work, held an entertain-
ment in the South Brisbane Technical College
on Thursday night, to raise further funds.
The Gov. and his lady sat in the front pews,
and Brig.-General and Mrs. Lee were among
the congregation.
Last Tuesday night the Inky Wayfarers of
Brisbane presented a gold A.J.A. badge to
Jim Webster, who has been at different times
president, treasurer and secretary of the
Brisbane branch. The presentation over, the
press gang, after casting a few shy glances
at each other, got rid of a song or two and
a few recitations. Norman Campbell, actor,
Bulletin bard and story-sketeher, who has
left the Daily Mail and is about to open
ns the terrible villain with George Marlow
at the Theatre Royal, contributed to the
gaiety. By the way, “Norbell” climbs into
khaki next month. His wife, Nella Camp-
bell, herself an experienced footlight lady,
recently appeared at the Royal and played
the part of an ancient and villainous Cock-
ney beldame in “The Ever Open Door.”
The Wistaria Fete, organised by Mrs. R.
O. Hatch and Miss Elfreda Walsh in aid
of the Soldiers’ Comforts Fund, was held
to-day. A concert, stage managed by Leon
Berliner, for the same good cause, happened
this evening. Next Friday the Fund will
get another lift, when Dan Carroll lends
West’s Olympia for the screening of “Britain
Prepared.”
The Wattle Day League holds its annual
corroboree next Friday, and has decided to
devote all funds to the purchase of artificial
limbs for maimed soldiers. Seeing that the
Federal Government has arranged to give
limbs to returned men who have mislaid
their own, some further explanation of the
League’s intentions should be made.
Vida Lahey, one of Brisbane’s cleverest
artists, packed up her brushes and left for
England by the Mongolia. Mildred Lovett,
well known in Sydney art, has taken over
her studio and classes.
The engagement is announced of. Lottie
Bond, daughter of Tom Bond. D. 5.0., to
Lieut. Miles Thompson, of the A.I.F.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

A Message to
Sufferers from
Rheumatism.
Scores of men and women continue to suffer
from Rheumatism and similar distressing
complaints, believing that little or nothing
can be done for them, while all the time
there is, within easy reach of all,
Dr. Parker s Great Indian
Rheumatic Remedy
an inexpensive and effective remedy which
will * quickly alleviate their suffering. Read
the following:—
SCIATICA AND STIFF JOINTS CURED.
John T. Hone, Orchardist, Sackville North,
writes: “The pain was most severe in the
Sciatic Nerve, from the hips to the knee, and
at times to the foot. Sharp, stabbing pains,
the knee joints were stiff, and I thought I
would eventually be crippled.”
“Dr. Parker’s Great Indian Rheumatic
Remedy did me good from the first. I soon
got relief. I persevered with the medicine,
and after using a few bottles I am thankful
to say I AM FREE FROM PAIN.”

Have You a BAD LEG
perhaps surrounded with inflammation and
swollen, that when you press your finger on
the inflamed part it leaves the impression ?
If so, under the skin you have poison, which
defies the remedies you have tried. Perhaps
your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round
which the skin may be discolored. The disease,
if allowed to continue, will deprive you of
the power to walk. You may have attended
hospitals and been told your case is hopeless,
or advised to submit to amputation, but do
not. Try the great British Remedy:—

“Haka”: The old lady wlio produced a pro-
cession of verses as proof of her age (B.
1/6/T6) has a rival. In a court in M.L. the
other day this other lady, when accused of
not putting enough water in it, weepingly
produced a photograph of her five sons at the
Front, and was at once excused by a patriotic
beak.
A Maoriland Billjim who had been in the
field with a gun for over a year and had re-
ceived only two letters from his best girl
was beginning to wonder whether she had
forgotten him, when a sweating mailman
rode into a desert camp in Egypt and handed
the doubting swaddie a bundle of mail con-
taining 111 letters *nut packets, all from the
one faithful heart.
“Trot”: One Australian mother was in the
wrong place the other day and another leaped
clear just in time, and on both occasions a
baby got more than it deserved. Incident
No. 1: A girl making linoleum polish found
the material in flames, tried to throw the
burning mass outside, and deposited it on
the baby instead. The mother rushed to the
rescue, and was fatally burned. No. 2: An
exasperated father, heaving the teapot at
mother, missed her but got home on the
infant. The moral seems to be that fire and
teapots should be left alone. Those young-
sters had better luck than a pair encoun-
tered up in Bananaland a while ago. One of
these nippers managed to get hold of a bottle
of arsenic, and was struggling to remove
the cork when the other happened along, col-
lared the goods and bolted to a quiet place.
He never bolted any more. And the one who
had been left howling wandered off next day
and was found drowned in a waterhole. But
none of these youngsters had the luck which
came my way in the long ago. Dad pro-
mised to give me a hiding when he came
home from work, but before he got back I
had the measles. So he had to give me some
toys instead, and I gave him the measles
just to show there was no ill-feeling.
More about Kimble Bent:—
Kimble Pent, the pakcha-Maori, passed out into
the final adventure at Wairau Hospital, in Marl-
borough (M.L.). He began life as a ’Murrican
citizen with a half-breed Indian mother, in the
State of Maine, served in the Yankee navy, put in
six uneasy years in the British Army, and was triced
up to the triangles in Taranaki and bit on the
bullet to the tune of 25 lashes for insubordination.
When he got over the flogging he made a bee-line
for the bush, lived with the Maoris for pretty well
50 years, and to his last day was shy of the inquisi-
tive pakeha and the police. He was the Hauhaus’
boss armorer and cartridge-maker through the Tara-
naki campaigns, helped build their stockades, joined
in their war-dances with nothing but a loin-mat
on his well-tanned hide, had two or three tattooed
wives, and made about as thoroughgoing a pagan
as any of his brown bush-mates. The only thing he
drew the line at, he told me, was “kai-tangata”—-
cannibalism. He was an eye-witness of two cannibal
feasts in the Taranaki bush in 1868; on each occa-
sion a white soldier’s body was eaten by the Hauhaus.
The old renegade’s technical description of the
cannibal cooks’ modus operandi made my hair curl.
And at the Moturoa fight in ’6B he saw the war-priest
of the bushmen cut out a soldier’s heart and offer
it in burnt sacrifice to Tu, the Maori Mars.
There seems to be a germ of art in the
name of Gill. The Adelaide Gallery Direc-
tor who died the other day was no connec-
tion of the Melbourne Gill who had charge
of the exhibition of Will Dyson’s drawings
a while ago. Nor is there any connection
between either of those Gills and the other
Gill of Melbourne, whose sons —Naylor and
Luther —are artist and art expert re-
spectively. They must all have been forced
into the fine-arts line by their patronymic.
Under the perverse spell of a more dreamily-
poetic name they might have drifted into
the bacon trade.
The first consumptive to land in Australia
and leave his bones here was Forby Suther-
land, who came with Captain Cook, died at
Botany Bay, and was buried at what is now
known as Kurnell. Cook named the place
Point Sutherland. A clump of shrubs is
supposed to be the spot where the grave was
made.
This was the first laugh the Federal
Convention had after it got to work in Adel-
aide. Henry Dobson, of Tasmania, was
talking about the franchise. “And how
many votes do they give a man in Tas-
mania?” asked a ribald cynic. “As many as
he deserves,” said Dobson, unabashed. Ap-
parently they still do. For every 100 per-
sons over 21 in the State there are 1011
electors on the roll. No doubt there are
some whose names stay in the lists after
they have moved to Hongkong, or further.
But there are others who are on the roll in
two places at once—or, occasionally, in
three.
The boot-trade lately showed how easily
it can be done. The employees demanded a
10 per cent, rise, on account of the same
old high cost of living. A conference of the
trade met to consider the matter. That
conference didn’t consider whether the rise
was a fair thing or not; it simply asked
whether the advance could be passed on.
When it found that this could be done it
promptly agreed to the 10 per cent, advance
in wages—-and then went home and marked
up the price of boots. Thus up went the
cost of living some more. In a country
which hadn’t borrowed anything from any
foreigner and hadn’t therefore to pay any
interest, and which, moreover, produced all
it consumed, it wouldn’t matter if wages
were pushed up to £5 a day. But for a
country which has borrowed and which does
import and which has to pay interest and
buy its imports with its exports, there is
trouble brewing if costs of production are
excessive. For this reason: no matter what
its costs are, it has to sell its exports at a
price fixed by what other countries can pro-
duce them for. The more we borrow from
abroad and the more we import, the more
we put ourselves in competition with the
low-wage foreigner; and a tariff as high as
Heaven can’t protect us from the conse-
quences, because we must take our goods into
the foreigner’s market to sell them.
TO SOMEBODY OR OTHER.

“That wonderful Little Camera” —
The Vest Pocket Kodak.
This letter came to our attention a short time ago :
“The Vest Pocket Kodak, that wonderful little camera,
bought as a ‘plaything’ for my son, I find myself using
it to the exclusion of my plate camera, inasmuch as the
majority of the negatives stand unbelievable enlarge-
ment.”
All that is necessary to convince one of the practicability of the
Vest Pocket Autographic Kodak is a personal acquaintance with
it. It’s the very essence of efficiency. So small and smooth that it
will readily slip into the vest pocket, so dainty that it is perfectly
at home in a lady’s handbag—the Vest Pocket Kodak may always
be carried where a largef camera would sometimes be an incon-
venience. This is one reason why the gentleman who sent us the
above letter found himself using it to the exclusion of his heavy
plate camera. Many people carry it all the time exactly as they
carry a watch. If you have room for a watch, you have room for
a Vest Pocket Kodak. You don’t know it’s there till you want it
and think of the picture possibilities you have missed because you
didn’t have a camera with you.
The Vest Pocket Autographic Kodak should not form the entire
photographic equipment. This is asking too much of it. There
are plenty of photographic situations that the larger Kodaks can
cope with more satisfactorily than can the Vest Pocket Kodak.
On the other hand, there are many occasions that a larger camera
is out of the question, and it is at such times that the Vest Pocket
Kodak fulfils its destiny. It should be a part of every photo-
graphic equipment—and it is proving itself to be a very important
part.
The Vest Pocket Kodak gives rectangular pictures, If x 2i inches,
but, to quote our correspondent, “the majority of the negatives
stand unbelievable enlargement.” The pictures in their own size
are very satisfactory, but to enlarge them to postcard size is a
perfectly simple operation. The Vest Pocket Enlarging Camera
lias been constructed for this one size enlargement, and performs
the operation most simply. It’s almost as easy as making the
contact print. Of course Vest Pocket negatives are not limited to
postcard size enlargement, and successful results have been
obtained with S x 10 enlargements, and even much larger. Post-
card size, however, has always been the most popular size for
amateurs, and Vest Pocket negatives and the Vest Pocket Kodak
Enlarging Camera prove a very successful combination.
All good Vest Pocket negatives will stand enlargement, but the
microscopic definition so desirable in this kind of work is best
secured with the Vest Pocket Kodak, fitted with the Kodak Anas-
tigmat f. 7.7, a lens ground from the finest glass and submitted
to those same rigid tests that have helped to make Kodak another
name for reliability. Kodak Anastigmat f. 7.7 is free from astig-
matism, and focuses sharply to the edges of each negative. In
short, it is an anastigmat of the highest quality possible, and at
f. 7.7 will do just what any anastigmat will do, regardless of price.
The Vest Pocket Kodak is a fixed focus Kodak —is ready for
business just as soon as you are. It has two instantaneous speeds,
1/25 and 1/50 of a second as well as time and bulb action. It
has a brilliant reversible finder, and uses Kodak Film cartridges
of 8 exposures Price 1/-. Mechanically it is as right as a full-
jewelled watch —photographically, in its own sphere, it could
hardly be improved upon.
The only man who could possibly be dissatisfied with the \ r est
Pocket Kodak would be the man who bought it for a plaything
and really wanted a plaything. He would be disappointed.
Though, of course, it is wonderfully simple to operate.
FOR SOLDIERS. —The Vest Pocket Autographic Kodak is the
Soldier’s Kodak, and meets every requirement of the soldier at the
Front or in the training camp. It is just what he needs, and
therefore makes an ideal gift for him.

PATENTS. —A useful feature embodied in
Patent Law enables an inventor at comparatively
small cost (with simple inventions £4 45.), even
before he has been to the expense of working out his
invention in practice, to procure “Provisional Protec-
tion,” and thus save the priority of a term to receive
full Patent rights in the Commonwealth of Australia,
and in any or all of those 26 countries having
Patent Laws, and which are parties with the
Commonwealth to the International Convention.
During this term, which is nine months in the
Commonwealth of Australia and 12 months in the
foreign countries, the inventor has ample opportunity
to test the full question of value, to work out his
invention and demonstrate its practicability. If the
principles of his invention are. seen to promise a
success he can proceed to take out full Patents; if
not, he need go to no further expense. During the
period of provisional protection the invention may
be made, used and sold without prejudicing the right
of the inventor to obtain valid Letters Patent. Full
information on Patents furnished free on application
to A. J. CALLTNAN, Registered Patent Attorney (by.
Official Examination, 1906), 281 Collins Street,
I Melbourne—’Phone 5199; or 14 CasUereagh Street,

A BILIOUS TONGUE,
When yonr tongue is coated evenly, all,

bilious. If you also have indigestion, con-
stipation, headache and a general ill feeling,
there is scarcely a doubt about it. Your liver
needs attention.
Harsh cathartics which purge violently
and then produce a reaction only aggravate
the trouble. Gentle assistance is what

Back Hot and Burning. Made It

and Ointment Healed.
48 Illavarra St., Williamstown, Vic. —
“For long over twelve months I had an
itching rash scattered all over between my
shoulders. After my meals, more so at
night, my back came out very hot and had
a burning sensation, and I would make it
bleed scratching at it, and caused sores to
appear which were inflamed at times and
my clothes used to irritate them.
“Then I sent for Cuticura Soap and Oint-
ment. I at once got relief and in a short
time all pimples were cleared and I am now
completely cured. As for the Cuticura Soap
I find it best of all for the skin. I have used
it for my little boy since birth.” (Signed)

THIS year the dainty foot daintily shod
comes into its own. Never wore skirts
shorter or fuller, never were shoes more in
evidence. So the smart woman will hail
with joy the arrival of the new Bostock styles
for the season, since these are more captivating:
than ever. The shoe here illustrated, for example,
is typically charming. Cut from that most
elegant of materials, patent leather, made in
that new, short-fronted French shape which
makes every foot look so arched and delightful,
this is the shoe of shoes to give a telling finish
to one’s new walking suit or gown. And it is only
one shoe amongst many equally desirable.

The rising price of paper and the boom in
freights and other oddments have given the
jumps to the proprietors of the two Hobart
dailies. From July 1 Mercury and Post
will cost lid. per copy instead of Id., and
subscribers will also he hit up, though not
quite as much as 50 per cent. The Labor
Daily Post, which is weaker than the old-
time Mercury, and has been reduced in
size, is likely to be pretty badly hurt in the
subscription list, and it’s a question whether
it will hold long to the agreement. The

Amongst other good men the Argus has
drawn to it lately is Norman Lilley, who
for some years has freelanced in Sydney.
He is one of the daring spirits who sought
to create the ideal Australian magazine, and
although he did not succeed the skeleton
of his effort will take long to moulder.
Other mounds of Lilley’s on the Inky Way
are the Literary pages which he conducted
for Sydney Mail and Worker. His hobbies'
are books and modesty, with an occasional
trip into verse.

Charlie Barrett, of Melbourne Herald,
has joined the Army Medical Corps. His
principal campaigns hitherto have aimed at
inducing a cynical news-editor to give him
five columns of space on page 1 for an illus-
trated article about model homes for blue
wrens, or shorter working hours for magpie
shrikes. Other causes he had at heart were
those of the boy scout and the golfer, which
quaint animals he handled with a tolerant
pen. When he was not giving his attention
to “Inquests 1 col.” or “Recruiting Com-
mittee, par. only,” he was a disciple of
Agassiz, to whom Nature, the old nurse,
said : “Here is a story-book that thy Father
hath written for thee.” He founded Mel-
bourne Bird Observers’ Club, was co-editor
of The Emu, and is an ornithologist of
Australian repute—which is no doubt why
he _ goes after the German eagle. He has
written several books of adventure for boys,
and hundreds of nature-study articles. And
he bears after his name the mystic letters
C.M.Z.S., compared with which D.S.O. are
no mote than N.I.L.

, ‘‘Quarter Single”: The most concise sui-
cide of the month was that of W. E. Barnes,
registrar of births and deaths at Wangaratta
(Vic.). He didn’t shoot himself till he had
filled in his own death certificate. It recalls
a rounds item chronicled by Billy Salter,
now of W.A., in his Argus days. A lady in
a ham-and-beef shop had, in the course of
an argument, nearly cut her husband’s nose
off with the chopper. On the way to the
hospital they made friends again, and the
husband, to shield bis wife, gave out that it
was a case of attempted suicide. Billy
brightly paragraphed the nose-cutting, and
headed his report “A Pioneer in Suicide.”
The wounded hero sued the Argus for libel.
Johnston, afterwards Judge, appeared for
the paper, but it wasn’t he that won the
case. The exact point at which victory
turned to the Argus was when Billy, re-
splendent in a frock coat and impeccable
etceteras, entered the box and placed a
faultless silk hat on the ledge on its fore-
castle. “What is your name?” he was
asked. Drawing himself together like a
Dreadnought about to be launched, Billy
fixed the foreman of the jury with his mild
and magnificent eye, and declaimed “William
—Ewart —'Gladstone —Salter.” The rest
was merely decent obsequies and a verdict
for th! defendant newspaper.

STANDARDISED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To this complaint, O harp, awake!
In our fair country, all o’ergrown
With bards of every shape and make,
I’ve no emotions of my own ;
No man of us can have a love —
No matter be she stout or slim,
A keen-billed hawk or meek-eyed dove—
That is original to him.
There is no girl that I can please,
But'all her points some minstrel bellows,'
And makes it very plain that she’s
Exactly like some other fellow’s;
Her little looks, her- turns of phrase,
Her pretty pout, her blush of shame,
Have all inspired a writer’s praise,
Embodied in some other dame.
I never had a subtle kiss,
And told myself in ecstasy:
“No other man was kissed like this—■
It is God-given, just for me!”
I never had endearment sweet
To cherish in my heart’s recess
But some rude scribe, with rhythm neat
Detailed my joy, my sweet caress.
The fond familiarities,
The words that I in whispers dole—
That no one hears, that no one sees,
All copyrighted in the soul—
Unshamed in public and for gold
A poet blurts. We are devised
All in the same unchanging mold,
And all our parts are standardised!

LONDON HAIR SPECIALISTS GENEROUS GIFT
Test this Splendid Hair-growing Preparation FREE.
A LIBERAL TRIAL OFFERED TO EVERY READER.
Every reader of this paper, man or woman,
who is distressed by falling, splitting hairs,
lank, “damp” hair, over-dry or over-greasy
hair, total or approaching baldness, scalp irri-
tation, dandruff, or any other hair defect,
should avail themselves of this opportunity
io test free of charge the renowned TRUE
HAIR GROWER. Mr. Burleigh announces
that he has so much faith in the merits of his
preparation, which it is well known has been
used extensively by persons in all walks of
life and in all parts of the world for up-
wards of 20 years, that he again invites our
readers to use the coupon below and make
early application for a EREE TRIAL. No
matter what the present condition of your
scalp may be, no matter what so-colled reme-
dies you have tried, until you have tested this
remarkable preparation you cannot appreciate
the value of a truly scientific method of hair
culture. You can prove in a few moments
each morning or evening how simple it is to
grow beautiful hair with Mr. Burleigh’s
TRUE HAIR GROWER, and how surpris-
ingly one’s whole appearance, brightness and
personal charms are improved by slight atten-
tion to the hair.
Hair troubles, like many other diseases,
have been wrongly diagnosed and altogether
misunderstood. The hair itself is not the
thing to be treated, for the reason that it is
simply a product of the scalp, and wholly
dependent upon its action. The scalp is
the very soil in which the hair is produced,

Mr. John Craven Burleigh, Mica Street, Broken Hill, N.S.W.,
321 Pitt Street, Sydney. March 2, 1916.
Dear Sir, —
I have now been using j'our True Hair Crower for the past three months, and find that
it accomplishes all that you claim for it. My hair was falling out considerably before
using your treatment, but I am pleased to say that it has entirely stopped falling and
is much thicker and longer. Your treatment has also been successful in improving
the length and thickness of my two daughters’ hair, aged 7 and 10 years respectively;
and, to give you an idea of the extent of our hair, I am enclosing herewith a couple
of photograph’s, which you may use in any way you think fit.
Thanking you for the benefits received, and assuring you that I will do my
utmost to increase the demands for your preparation in this town,
I am, yours very truly, (Signed) Mrs. M. HALL.
POST TO-DA Y
nurtured and grown, and it alone should
receive the attention if results are to be
expected. It would do no earthly good to
treat the stem of a plant with a vietv to mak-
ing it grow and become more beautiful—the
soil in which the plant grows must be
attended to. Therefore, the scalp, in which
the hair grows, must receive the attention if
you are to expect it to grow and become more
beautiful. Loss of hair is caused by the scalp
drying up or losing its supply of moisture or
nutriment; when baldness occurs, the scalp
has simply lost all its nourishment, leaving
nothing for thejhair to feed upon. (A plant,
or even a tree, would die under similar condi-
tions.) The natural thing to do in either
case is to feed or replenish the soil or scalp,
as the case may be, and your crop will grow
and multiply as Nature intended it should.
Mr. Burleigh’s TRUE HAIR GROWER, we
understand, has a most wonderful effect upon
the hair glands and tissues of the scalp. It
is the only remedy for the hair ever discov-
ered that is similar to the natural foods or
liquids of the scalp. It penetrates the pores
quickly, and the hair soon shows the effects of
its wonderful, exhilarating and life-produc-
ing qualities.
Post the COUPON below TO-DAY, enclosing
3d. stamps for postage, etc. By return you will
receive (1) a liberal supply of Mr. Craven
Burleigh’s True Hair Grower, (2) an interesting
32-page booklet entitled “Concerning the Hair.”
This book has been carefully written, and contains
much valuable information concerning the hair that
could not be obtained from any other source. It
will prove a valuable guide and reference book.

Australia’s Best
Crop Babies.
Healthy Babes are they whose Mothers keep
them free from Winter’s ills by timely
use of DR. SHELDON’S NEW DISCOVERY.
With Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery to rely upon, the
mother need have no fear, for Winter’s Ills are kept
away from her child, and steady development may
go on as in the Summer months. Should the
children contract Whooping Cough, Dr. Sheldon’s
New Discovery can be relied upon to alleviate the
attacks of coughing, and to cut short the duration
of the disease. With Measles, the only treatment
is to keep the child warm in bed, and give regular
doses of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery to control
the cough. There will be no after effects from
Measles if Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is used
according to direction. In sudden attacks of
Croup, the dose must be repeated at more frequent
intervals, when relief will come quickly, and ever
afterwards, when the child appears the least
croupy, the attack can be averted by the prompt use
of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.

Where Sapling Tops Are Red.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I KNOW a street in a seaside town,
Where ceaseless feet go up and down,
And restless pulses beat;
Upon its pavement hopes are strewn —-
Was it last night or yesternoon
I walked that seaside street?
I met Lies clad in lace and gold,
Lies young and sweet, and sour and old,
Lies fleet of foot and slow; ,
There walked the robber, plunderer, thief,
There —with mouth red as a red rose-leaf —
The wanton, eyes aglow.
There minced my lady Powder Puff,
Tricked out in gold and silken stuff
And plume and gem and flower,
The-broken heart, the heart to break —•
Poor Human Nature out to make
The best of its brief hour.
And then said I: “Full sick am I
Of lying lips, and hearts that lie,
And Self in deed and word!”
Then all at once amid the rout
A Way was made —gates opened out —•
This summoned, and I heard!
Was it last night or yesternoon
I left that town, where hopes lie strewn
As thick as leaves wind-shed?
I know not, care not —an ye please.
Why should I care couched here at ease
Where sapling tops are red?
llow other to the roar, the rush—
These silent ways, this golden hush,
These tall trees green and grey !
Now, where’s my lady Powder Puff?
And where her scents and silken stuff,
And what’s her value —say?
I think here was green gaiety, •
And gossiping ’twixt tree and tree,
Ere I disturbed the fioon;
Full suddenly the birds grew dumb,
A startled stillness seemed to come—•
A sleep, a spell, a swoon !
For musing in the golden air,
As I lay thus, I grew aware
Of worlds beyond my ken ;
Of something in the conscious wood —•
A soul, a sense, a mind, a mood
Not understood of men.
The old wood-folk are dead and gone-
The nymph, the satyr and the faun,
The sylvan company;
And yet around me dwells the grace
That moulded shining form and face
And peopled poetry.
If underneath these arching skies
A sudden burst of mirth should rise
And echo wide around,
I would not count it out of touch
With things about, nor overmuch
Make marvel at the sound.
Nor would I wonder if there sped
Down yonder ways of green and red
A sudden passion-gust—•
Nymphs flying, lips apart and mute;
Goat-footed satyrs in pursuit
With reaching hands out-thrust.
I go not to the seaside town
Y here ceaseless feet move up and down,
And many hopes lie dead ;
For better far are gracious trees,
A musing hour, a couch of ease,
Where sapling-tops are red.
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
The Luck of Helsingfors.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BKUNO HELSINGFORS, the big,
blue-eyed, yellow-haired, Viking-
moustached Norwegian, first mate of
the Star of Papua, slept naked in the steam-
ing air of the tropics, which had given wings
to the copra bugs. Youth was in every
rippling muscle of him ; strength and clean-
liness in the lvhiteness of his skin. On his
great arms and wide breasts the rough
artists of the forecastle in his early days of
the sep. had made tattooings in the blue of
gunpowder and the dull red of lead. So
decorated he lay there breathing easily in
the heated cabin; sleeping and smiling in
his sleep—a splendidly handsome thing;
one to thank God for.
The fan, running on its third speed, made
waves in the thicker air. As the ship, rolled
to starboard in the stale swell, admitted the
red sun to stare for a moment through the
port at the closed eyes of the sleeper, he
turned over on his side with his face to the
cabin wall. A thin, dark hand, almost like
a bird’s claw in its absence of flesh, and
covered with black hairs clammy with sweat,
pulled back the cabin door-curtain on its
rings; the mess-room steward entered, and
laid down a cup of coffee and a plate of
biscuits on the cedar top of the low bureau.
The steward—a little, thin, worried Londoner,
yellow of skin and pouched of neck —rattled
the curtain rings on their brass bar, and
Bruno Helsingfors awoke.
The Carolines lay astern; away, some-
where in the invisibility ahead, lay the
Straits of San Bernardino, and the six hun-
dred islands of the Philippines. San Ber-
nardino is seen mostly as an open lane under
a clear sky sown with islands —islands
everywhere, as if Creation had spilled a
quart of them in mere spendthrift careless-
ness.
A hundred and fifty miles from the Straits
they ran into a deep haze, settling on the
sea like curtains, and capriciously torn and
closed again by wind that came in puffs and
varied in direction; yet it gave them no
concern, with a good ship and a mile or so
of water under it. But, naturally, the
people in the smoking-room, glad of the
haze because it provided conversation, talked
of wrecks and sea disasters —to their own
enjoyment and the discomfort of the thin,
dark messroom steward on duty as drink-
waiter that watch.
They talked of wrecks and founderings; of
cranky ships and changing lists; of sea-
cocks opened, and disasters in a calm ocean;
of coffin ships, and heavy insurances that
give the seaman no right to protection ot
life outside the three-mile limit; of the Elbe,
and the collier, steering wild, that sank her
in collision —two ships on a wide sea
attracted to each other as if magnetised;
of the overloaded Taramung sunk by follow-
ing seas; of the Koombana and Yongala
overwhelmed by cyclones ; of typhoons in the
China Sea; blundering junks by the great
Ladrones; colliers hitting Bramble Cay and
strewing their coal like apples out of an
overturned basket; the Catterthun and Seal
Rocks, the Wairarapa and the Great
Barrier; the sunken galleon of Throne
Shoal; the Elingamite at the Islands of the
Three Kings.
Chief-officer Bruno Helsingfors smoked his
fat cheroots in silence until he heard a wild
enthusiast talking of the sea’s romance; and
then he spat out half an inch of cigar leaf
and talked.
“Yah! I vill tell you der romances! Nor-
vegians buy der rotten ships of all der vorldt.
You hear of miserable ship foundering in
calm —it is offenly der Norvegians. I haf
ship on a barque at Cardiff boundt by
chains fore and afdt so she shall nodt fall
do bieces vile ve loadt der coals. In der
Nort Sea she go down —ve in der boats are;
and ve vatch der ship sink slow, so slow,
like ve vas in der teatre vatching a bainted
ship go down. Then ve are alone in der
Nort Sea —fourteen men in von boat. Ve
haf von saldt ham and von bugget vater for
tree days before ve are pick-ed up....1t is
so terrible time that ever since I carry vis
me this.’’
He took from his breast-pocket a small tin
case and held it up before them.
“What is that. Chief?”
“It is a capsule of cyanite of potass, so
that if ever I am wreck-ed some more I
suffer not too much.”
As he returned the case to his pocket
eight bells struck, and Chief-officer Bruno
Helsingfors threw his cheroot away and
went out to duty. When he had left the
smoking-room the dark, thin steward
shivered. The sea and its dangers held him
for his necessities, and he could find no
philosophy to firing to him the careless cheer-
fulness of use.
The haze lifted with the dawn and came
down again to the sea late in the afternoon,
and the wind puffs seemed to return with
it; probably because the tearing of the mists
by the variable winds made the air
movement visible. As the haze deepened
with the dusk, the dark, thin steward,
always in a cold sweat in anything approach-
ing a high temperature, moved about the
deck and smoking-room afraid as a man
under sentence of death, cursed with imagi-
nation and a memory indelible. Meantime
the cheery laugh of Chief-officer Bruno
Helsingfors was heard as he came off duty,
as if duty were a picnic.
As the Star of Papua approached San
Bernardino Strait that night the _ haze
deepened to the thickness of many veils of
grey chiffon. Only the occasional tearing of
the veil by a wind-puff was outside to tell
the ship the way; for the rest, she had the
chart and her observation of the red beacon;
and in such safety she threaded the twisting
channel as the fog settled down on her. still
intangible, but of the harsh tint of crape.
Bruno Helsingfors came off the bridge at
midnight; an hour later he awoke the
moment the engines stopped. The thin,
dark steward awoke trembling and switched
on the light to soften the blackness of the
fog which had sent its ghost to the interior
of the ship. The steward drew on his
clothes, sweating cold in this, sudden
inversion of the ship’s habit; the chief officer
tumbled into his pyjamas, intent only on
his clothing, and refusing to marvel as to
causes until he could find them out.
He found the deck spotting the fog with
light and men rushing fore and aft to hasty
orders.
“Journals running hot,” said the captain
as Helsingfors stood at the foot of the
bridge companion—“a damned careless lot
we’ve had to stop the engines. Get a
sea ancho/ out to check the drift, and we’ll
chance the engines whenever we’ve got to
get steerage way.”
Chief-officer Helsingfors hurried the coolie
crews in the making of a sea-anchor from
the deck-cargo of Australian hardwood
hound to Manila for harbor works. He put
half a dozen slings around the long raft, and
with a cargo winch lifted it, slung it over-
board, and down to the water. The sea
gripped it, and it floated aft to the limit of
its cable, showing the set of the current to
be astern.
“Afdt or astern dond’t matter,” said
Helsingfors to the Old Man. “Everyvere
there is rocks andt islandts, andt all der vorld
is made of fog.”
A gusty wind blew from dead ahead; the
captain spoke to the engine-room; the pro-
peller revolved for ten minutes, and stopped
again to a strong smell of burning oil and
heated metal. In that ten minutes Chief-
officer Helsingfors dressed himself fully, and
as he came to the bridge again he felt for the
cyanide-case in his breast pocket, and so
was reassured.
The passengers had been quieted with lies,
and sent to bed ; the ship drifted slowly for
half an hour, and then was brought up again,
to a position that might be safety in the
darkness, by a few minutes’ steam; but the
imaginative steward shivered in apprehen-
sion, unable to think, and holding down with
all his soul the almost overmastering desire
to scream. The tide ran strongly eastward,
seeming to suck them back through the
Straits, through which they were fain to win
to open sea, only that the way was sown with
rocks, and chance and indecision seemed the
only plan of safety. Then, an hour before
daylight came to lift the mist, and when cool
bearings seemed to be near, the Star of
Papua grounded, tore herself clear, struck
and listed heavily to starboard.
Pell-mell, passengers and crew flung them-
selves in darkness on the boats; the water
reached the fires, the smoke came out of her
funnels thick as wool, hut showing only as a
floceulent smear under the one star that
pierced the fog above the ship. Ere they
could get the boats clear the ship slipped off
the rock into deep water, taking with her
almost all her company in the suction.

THE KIDNEYS
NEVER REST.
The kidneys never take a moment’s rest; they keep on with
their great work of filtering out uric acid and kidney poisons,
day after day, night after night, as long as we live. And so
important is their work that, even though they get only a little
behind, no part of the system is free from danger; the back
aches, the limbs drag, the eyelids seem like lead ; there are
dropsical swellings, rheumatic pains, dizzy spells, urinary
troubles; the sufferer is moody, despondent and irritable.
This is how the fatal Bright’s disease begins.
o o

Bruno Helsingfors, kicking his shoes off,
dived far out from the starboard side. Cries
and yells of terror came to him out of the
warm water. He did not see the ship’s last
plunge, but felt it in the displacement of
the water, and struck further out to star-
board of her. The screaming ceased ; the
big Norwegian swam a little, floated for 20
minutes, and swam again ; and then his feet
touched rock, and he struggled into shallower
water and found himself at daylight on a
flat rock as big as a dining-table, in four
teet ot water, and with a tide almost run
out.
The haze thinned, then lifted, and he saw
swimming feebly near him, and supported by
a partly-submerged stand for fire buckets, a
thin dark head, a livid yellow face, a
little black moustache drooping and wrung
out to a wisp by the sea. Helsingfors went
into the water to his neck, and drew to the
shallows on the rock the steward who had
been more afraid than any, and yet had won
through.
These two men stood mid-thigh in the
water, and looked around them as the haze
lilted for a circle of 500 yards or so. And
then Helsingfors shouted welcome to the
eight men—two white men and six Chinese
whom the chance of the current had
brought to this little ark of stone that was
four feet under water. The eight men swam
to the rock and the ten huddled together,
all differences of race and caste forgotten in
the tragedy of the ship.
“Der Old Man gone, andt all der passen-
chers,” said Helsingfors, “unless they vasgedt
to some udder islandt, and ve can’t flndt oudt
till der sun come.”
But the sun did not come. The dawn'
wind tore the haze, and showed them, a mile
or more away, heavy shapes which might be
islands or clouds, but nothing to show of
life, there or between. Then the drab
morning saw tlie wind rolling up the haze,
and the day opened in rain, flattening the
sea still more, and blotting out the islands
that might be clouds.
Dull with hunger and sodden with the sea,
they jostled each other on the rock for
hours that seemed like days. Helsingfors
maintained the place he had won at start-
ing, in the most central and highest posi-
tion on the rock. Next him the imagina-
tive steward shivered with apprehension at
every change in the water, and the warm
rain fell ecaselessly on them all, pitting the
ocean, and steaming in its passage through
the heated air. Helsingfors, feeling warmer
about the waist, looked down, and saw that,
the tide had risen to his belt.
A Chinaman on the outer edge of the rock
began to jabber excitedly in his own tongue;
his fellow coolies joined him, pointing ex-
citedly to the quarter where advanced the
tide. A dozen fins, like wet, black, flattened
horns, furrowed the sea; the fins swept
around the stony refuge and waited as if they
sentinelled it —sharks coming from greater
depths with the rising of the tide, and cor-
ralling the men. Helsingfors drew a long
breath and steeled himself; the steward
whimpered, and his legs went from under
him. Helsingfors put a great arm around
the steward, and held him up.
The sharks stalked them as if they en-
joyed the sport. A black fin sank; a ripple
came to the outer edge of the rock, a belly-
flash of white showed below, and with a yell
quickly smothered by the water a Chinaman
disappeared.
Then followed a brute struggle for life; a
struggle of worms to delay the inevitable
giant. Helsingfors, still supporting the
weakling, held his position in the centre. His
belt was hidden by the water now. The
sharks, feeling the extra depth, grew bolder,
and slaughtered the wrecked men one by
one, as if they were calves in a shambles.
Then even Helsingfors grew sick of the
rushing assassin shapes, of the reddened
water, and the shrieking men drawn under
one by one. He still held the fainting
steward ; but he closed his eyes. While so
self-blindfolded lie heard the terrible sounds
and anguish nearer him, and opened his eyes
again to find the steward and himself alone
upon the rock —and the tide apparently
stationary. The steward’s face was green
with horror; he seemed dying of fear.
The sharks held off for a little; the rain
ceased, and the sun split the moist air.
Around him Helsingfors saw the misty
shapes of real islands—the presence of firm
ground beckoning the shipwrecked, and the
sharks mocking the fading hope. The
steward, held in the crook of the big Nor-
wegian’s arm, moaned the bitterness of it
all; and the big heart of Helsingfors softened
for the other man’s need.
He drew from his pocket the little case of
cyanide,"'‘shook the steward into conscious-
ness, and, with a full knowledge of the self-
sacrifice, offered him the capsule.
“You poor liddle chap,” said Helsingfors.
“Take der cyanite. I am strong—l can
trown.”
But the other, awakened by the imminence
of death, put the cyanide from him with a
cry of fear, and drew away from Helsingfors
as if ho feared enforced death.
“No, no, Chief! I want to live! I can’t
die—-I can’t die !’’
“Poor little, foolish shap. You cannot
lif....And this is easy.... Come, there is
enough for von.”
But the steward, screaming, forced the
Norwegian’s hands away, crying, without
reason, as a baby might, that he wanted to-
live, and could not die.
Helsingfors, weary of it all. and with the
long horror of that drift in the North Sea
sharp in his memory, made a gesture of dis-
gust of this cowardice; looked at the sea,
empty but for the unapproachable islands
and the cruising sharks; tore off the lid of
the case in his strong white teeth, and swal-
lowed the capsule. lie crumpled at the
knees as if a sledge hammer had struck him
over the heart; bis head went, back into the
water; lie floated off the rock, and drifted
seawards. The sharks followed him. swim-
ming around his body, but not touching itr
puzzled, maybe, by the blue of his uniform
and the black socks that hid his feet.
And then, around the cape of the
nearest island that had lost .all its
disguising haze, came a little Filipino
steamer, the Binondo, bound for Pasig River,
and rescued the steward, to prove that the
theory of the fittest surviving is little more
than a poor sort of joke.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
The Woman with the Hoe.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
p| HE was standing in a potato patch,
the woman with the hoe. Her face
had tanned unevenly, and graduated
from pale cinnamon to old roan, with
patches of nigger-liead. Her arms were
embossed with freckles.
“Damn this ’ere war,” she said. “Lemme
get a holt of Mister Andrew Hartigan,
M.P., I’ll teach him.” Then with infinite
disgust: “Him ’n’ his war!’
She swiped away the sweat ot her brow
with a forearm, and glanced reproachfully
at the sun.
"Four more hours iv it,” she said. When
we was all at ’ome it was ’ard enough, but
me ’n’ mum didn’t kill ourselfs. Then Bill
went ’n’ ’listed, ’n’ scooted off t’ their
bloomin’ war. That left me with all the
milkin’. Dan said the place was_ gittin’
slower ’n’ more lonesome, ’n’ next we knew
he was a soldier, ’n’ off t’ enjoy hisself
fightin’ too. That left me with the pigs on
me ’ands, ’n’ the garden t’ look to. Now
Tom’s gone; ’n’ if I don’t harvest these
spuds they’ll rot, ’n’ there’s been a bloke
here after dad, ’cause dad knows horses.
Well, let ’em have him, ’n’ it’ll be up t’ me t’
do the ploughin’ ’n’ ’arretin’, ’n’ get the seed
in atop iv everythin’ else. S’pose they think
three men’s work don’t make any difference
to a girl while she’s about it. But wait till
I meet Hartigan.”
The woman with the hoe turned up a few
tubers and sighed despairingly.
“That ain’t all I got agin Hartigan ’n’
his war,” she continued. “Steve Jonson
come over near every mornin’ t’ see me
milk; said he never seen the like iv it, ’n’
if things ’eld out he’d be marryin’ me. But
1 lartigan, M.P., come up ’ere, torkin’ about
his war. wantin’ ’ands for it, ’n’ off goes me
noble Steve, ’n’ gets hisself shot. Then
Charley Ryan comes hangin’ round, gettin’
interested in me milkin’, till one day he
says he’d like t’ be trackin’ with me, but for
the present lie’s goin’ t’ the war, he is. He
went, ’n’ I ain’t ’eard iv him since. Har-
tigan ’n’ his war!” she said with vindictive
derision. “Hartigan, M.P. ! Pie orter be
shot. No sooner gets inter Parliament than
lie’s gotter have a war.”
This was three weeks ago. Yesterday I
learned that Mr. Hartigan, M.P., the ener-
getic representative of Bunang (including
Flatrock, Crane’s Crossing and Squirrel
Hill) in the Legislative Assembly, had been
assaulted by a farmer’s daughter with a
hoe. Mr. Hartigan does not intend taking
action, I am told, as the girl was obviously
under a delusion. It was a funny thing, she
said, they had never had any wars at
Squirrel Ilill till Hartigan was sent to
Parliament.

Utopia.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HERE'S a land where nothing matters
I Sleeping in a silver sea,
JL Where the breeze of morning scatters
Golden fruit from every tree.
Where the pumpkins young and willing
Climb inside the kitchen door,
And the waves are always.spilling
Choicest fish along the shore.
There the population browses
On the best the world can give,
And the men who own the houses
Give their tenants leave to live
In the greatest of contentment.
Without cash, or price, or fee;
None could tell us there what rent meant,
For the bricks and land are free.
Every dimpled damsel knows her
Trousseau can be got for- naught,
Never comes a wrathful grocer
, With a bill for things you bought,
Furniture is given gratis,
No one’s credit e’er can stop,
Everybody’s summer hat is
Simply taken from the shop.
No one worries o’er insurance.
No one speaks of cheap or dear,
Tom and Bill with great endurance
Front a world of priceless beer,
None for gold misspent need sorrow,
None for ready coin need pray,
Everyone can freely borrow
Cash he never need repay.
There methinks must be enjoyment
More than in this march of mind,
For the wealth of unemployment
Makes the world and nature kind.
There no sham and no pretension
Stirs spleen or wakes the gall;
No one ever needs to mention
Any blessed thing at all.
There the artist paints his pictures
As the warm cow chews the cud,
And the critic’s'fiercest strictures
Fall like gentle flakes of mud ;
There the poet keeps on stringing
Rhymes from dawn till evening dim,
And the people hear his singing
Without throwing things at him.
Young joy never goes a-missing,
Even naldheads have their day,
Reddest lips are there for kissing,
Brightest eyes make happy play;
Every morn is crisp with laughter,
Every evening glad with song,
No one fears the morning after
For you simply can’t go wrong.
Y'et amid enjoyment utter
And a world remote from care
One black flag is seen to flutter
Regularly on the air.
Joy the dregs of doom is scorning
In that bright and sunny land,
For on every Tuesday morning
Someone hangs the German land!
